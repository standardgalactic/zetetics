Abstract
The main contribution of this thesis is to examine the utility of kernel regression ap-
proaches and variance component models for solving complex problems in statistical
genetics and molecular biology. Many of these types of statistical methods have been
developed speciﬁcally to be applied to solve similar biological problems. For example,
kernel regression models have a long history in statistics, applied mathematics, and
machine learning. More recently, variance component models have been extensively
utilized as tools to broaden understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic varia-
tion. However, because of large combinatorial search spaces and other confounding
factors, many of these current methods face enormous computational challenges and
often suﬀer from low statistical power — particularly when phenotypic variation is
driven by complicated underlying genetic architectures (e.g. the presence of epistatic
eﬀects involving higher order genetic interactions). This thesis highlights two novel
methods which provide innovative solutions to better address the important statis-
tical and computational hurdles faced within complex biological data sets. The ﬁrst
is a Bayesian non-parametric statistical framework that allows for eﬃcient variable
selection in nonlinear regression which we refer to as “Bayesian approximate kernel
regression”, or BAKR. The second is a novel algorithm for identifying genetic vari-
ants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners
with which the variants interact. We refer to this method as the “MArginal ePIs-
tasis Test”, or MAPIT. Here, we develop the theory of these two approaches, and
iv

demonstrate their power, interpretability, and computational eﬃciency for analyz-
ing complex phenotypes. We also illustrate their ability to facilitate novel biological
discoveries in several real data sets, each of them representing a particular class of
analyses: genome-wide association studies (GWASs), molecular trait quantitative
trait loci (QTL) mapping studies, and cancer biology association studies. Lastly, we
will also explore the potential of these approaches in radiogenomics, a brand new
subﬁeld of genetics and genomics that focuses on the study of correlations between
imaging or network features and genetic variation.

Introduction
Genetic and genomic mapping studies, in the form of genome-wide association studies
(GWASs) (The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Randall et al., 2013;
Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, 2013; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psy-
chiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014) molecular trait quantitative trait loci (QTL)
mapping studies (Pickrell et al., 2010; Battle et al., 2013; Lappalainen et al., 2013;
Tung et al., 2015), and cancer biology association studies (Dews et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2014; Civelek and Lusis, 2014; Peng et al., 2015) have identiﬁed thousands
of genetic loci associated with many complex traits and common diseases, providing
insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic variation (Visscher et al., 2012). Most
of these existing genetic and genomic mapping studies look at one variant at a time
and focus on identifying marginal genetic associations that exhibit either additive or
dominant eﬀects. However, it has long been hypothesized that eﬀects beyond addi-
tivity could contribute to a large proportion of phenotypic variation. In particular,
epistasis — the interaction between genetic loci — is thought to play a key role in
deﬁning the genetic architecture underlying complex traits (Phillips, 2008; Mackay,
2014) and constituting the genetic basis of evolution (Carlborg et al., 2006; Martin
1

et al., 2007). Indeed, studies have detected pervasive epistasis in many model or-
ganisms (Bloom et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2008; He et al., 2010; Chari and Dworkin,
2013; Monnahan and Kelly, 2015; Mackay, 2014; Collins et al., 2006; Costanzo et al.,
2010; Horn et al., 2011; Lehner et al., 2006; Szappanos et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2004;
Byrne et al., 2007; Onge et al., 2007; Deutschbauer and Davis, 2005; Gerke et al.,
2009; Brem et al., 2005; Gaertner et al., 2012; Flint and Mackay, 2009; Cheverud
et al., 2001; Jarvis and Cheverud, 2011; Leamy et al., 2011; Stylianou et al., 2006;
Peripato et al., 2004; Hanlon et al., 2006; Pettersson et al., 2011; Kroymann and
Mitchell-Olds, 2005; Rowe et al., 2008; Wentzell et al., 2007). However, substan-
tial controversies remain (Hill et al., 2008; M¨aki-Tanila and Hill, 2014; Huang and
Mackay, 2016). For example, in some settings, genetic mapping studies have identi-
ﬁed many candidates of epistatic interactions that contribute to quantitative traits
and diseases (Brown et al., 2014; Genetic Analysis of Psoriasis Consortium and The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2, 2010; Hemani et al., 2014; Evans et al.,
2011), but some of these eﬀects can be explained by additive eﬀects of other unse-
quenced variants (Wood et al., 2014). On the other hand, while previous variance
partition studies have shown that genetic variance for many traits are mainly ad-
ditive (Hill et al., 2008; M¨aki-Tanila and Hill, 2014; Crow, 2010), these conclusions
have been challenged recently (Huang and Mackay, 2016). Furthermore, while mod-
eling epistasis has been recently shown to increase phenotype prediction accuracy in
modal organisms (Forsberg et al., 2017) and facilitate genomic selection in animal
breeding programs (Jiang and Reif, 2015; Mu˜noz et al., 2014), such conclusions do
not hold in all settings (Aschard et al., 2012). Finally, epistasis has been recently
proposed as one of the main factors that explain missing heritability — the propor-
tion of heritability not explained by the top associated variants in GWASs (Visscher
et al., 2012; Eichler et al., 2010). In particular, studies have hypothesized that epis-
tasis can confound heritability estimation in pedigree studies and cause inﬂation of
2

heritability estimates, creating the so-called “phantom heritability” (Hemani et al.,
2013; Zuk et al., 2012). However, for some traits, the contribution of epistasis to
missing heritability is negligible (Yang et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, because of the potential importance of epistasis in deﬁning the ge-
netic architecture of complex traits, many statistical methods have been developed
to identify nonlinear interactions in genetic and genomic mapping studies (Cordell,
2009; Wei et al., 2014; Civelek and Lusis, 2014). However, because of large combina-
torial search spaces and other confounding factors, many of these current methods
face enormous computational challenges and often suﬀer from low statistical power
— particularly when phenotypic variation is driven by complicated underlying ge-
netic architectures (e.g. the presence of epistatic eﬀects involving higher order genetic
interactions).
The main contribution of this thesis is to examine the utility of novel Bayesian
kernel regression models and variance component methodologies for solving com-
plex problems in statistical genetics and molecular biology, as well as explore the
potential of these approaches in new subﬁelds of genetics and genomics such as ra-
diogenomics. Speciﬁcally, kernel regression models have a long history in statistics
and applied mathematics (Aronszajn, 1950; de Boor and Lynch, 1966; Micchelli and
Wahba, 1981; Schoenberg, 1942; Parzen, 1963; Wahba, 1990). The machine learning
literature on kernel based methods is also extensive (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Evge-
niou et al., 2000; MacKay, 2002; Poggio and Girosi, 1990b; Rasmussen and Williams,
2006; Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2001; Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004; Sollich, 2002;
Tipping, 2001; Vapnik, 1998; Zhang et al., 2011b), and there is also a large (partially
overlapping) literature in Bayesian inference (Chakraborty et al., 2012a; H´ajek, 1961,
1962; MacKay, 2002; Pillai et al., 2007; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006; Sollich, 2002;
Tipping, 2001; Zhang et al., 2011b). Variance component models have a more recent
history, and have been extensively utilized in biological applications (Wu et al., 2011;
3

Moser et al., 2015; Zhou and Stephens, 2012; Zhou et al., 2013; Zhou and Stephens,
2014; Price et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2010; Lippert et al., 2011; Yu
et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010b; Korte et al., 2012; Meuwissen et al., 2001; Speed
and Balding, 2014; Gusev et al., 2014; Speed et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2011b; Loh
et al., 2015; Pirinen et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014). This thesis highlights two speciﬁc
novel methods: (1) a Bayesian non-parametric statistical framework that allows for
eﬃcient variable selection in nonlinear regression; and (2) a novel algorithm for iden-
tifying genetic variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify
the exact partners with which the variants interact. Here, we develop the theory
of these methods, and demonstrate their power, interpretability, and computational
eﬃciency when analyzing complex phenotypes — particularly when phenotypic vari-
ation is driven by complicated underlying genetic architectures (e.g. the presence of
epistatic eﬀects involving higher order genetic interactions). In particular, we show
how these analytic tools provide innovative solutions to better address important
statistical and computational hurdles faced within complex biological data sets.
In Chapter 2, we propose a novel framework that provides an analogue of the
eﬀect size of each explanatory variable for Bayesian kernel regression models when
the kernel is shift-invariant — for example the Gaussian kernel. We use function
analytic properties of shift-invariant reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to
deﬁne a linear vector space that (1) captures nonlinear structure and (2) can be
projected onto the original explanatory variables. The projection onto the original
explanatory variables serves as the analogue of eﬀect sizes. The speciﬁc function ana-
lytic property we use is that shift-invariant kernel functions can be approximated via
random Fourier bases. Based on the random Fourier expansion we propose a compu-
tationally eﬃcient class of Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR) models
for both nonlinear regression and binary classiﬁcation for which one can compute an
analogue of eﬀect sizes. By adapting some classical results in compressive sensing we
4

state conditions under which BAKR can recover a sparse set of eﬀect sizes, (i.e. si-
multaneous variable selection and regression). We illustrate the utility of BAKR by
examining, in some detail, two important problems in statistical genetics: genomic
selection (predicting phenotype from genotype) and association mapping (inference
of signiﬁcant variables or loci). State-of-the-art methods for genomic selection and
association mapping are based on kernel regression and linear models, respectively.
BAKR is the ﬁrst method that is competitive in both settings. We will provide
empirical evidence that BAKR performs as well or better than top methods for both
genomic selection and association mapping. An observation relevant to genetics is
that BAKR and nonlinear regression models tend to have greater advantage over
linear models when the observed samples are related. This chapter is joint work
with Kris C. Wood, Xiang Zhou, and Sayan Mukherjee (Crawford et al., 2016a).
In Chapter 3, we examine the use of a logistic extension of BAKR in cancer
genomics as we model transcriptomic data from matched pre-treatment and post-
relapse BRAF-mutant melanoma patient tumors with functional interrogation. The
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been well documented as be-
ing an important driver in BRAF-mutant melanoma. Targeted therapies aimed to in-
hibit oncogenic signaling within these cancers have proven to yield high rates of initial
clinical responses; however, relapse in these patients is almost inevitable as diverse
signaling pathways can drive resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (i.e. BRAFi
and MEKi), making durable control of resistance a major challenge. Here, we discov-
ered that major pathways of resistance converge to activate the transcription factor
c-MYC (MYC). MYC expression and gene signatures identiﬁed by BAKR were sup-
pressed following initial drug treatment, then rebounded during tumor progression
independent of the upstream pathway driving resistance. MYC suppression using
genetic approaches was suﬃcient to both resensitize diverse BRAFi/MEKi-resistant
models and delay resistance in treatment na¨ıve models. This chapter is part of a
5

larger collaborative eﬀort with Katie Singleton, Sayan Mukherjee, and Kris C. Wood
(Singleton et al., 2016).
In Chapter 4, we reexamine the interpretability limitations of the BAKR model
and present an alternative strategy for mapping epistasis and nonlinear interactions:
instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we
focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic eﬀects — the com-
bined pairwise interaction eﬀects between a given variant and all other variants. By
testing marginal epistatic eﬀects, we can identify candidate variants that are involved
in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants
interact, thus potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational bur-
den associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Here, our method is
based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance
component estimation method for eﬃcient parameter inference and p-value compu-
tation. We refer to our method as the “MArginal ePIstasis Test”, or MAPIT. With
simulations, we show how MAPIT can be used to estimate and test marginal epistatic
eﬀects, produce calibrated test statistics under the null, and facilitate the detection
of pairwise epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the beneﬁts of MAPIT in a
QTL mapping study by analyzing the gene expression data of over 400 individuals
from the GEUVADIS consortium. This chapter corresponds to joint work with Ping
Zeng, Sayan Mukherjee, and Xiang Zhou (Crawford et al., 2017).
Finally, in Chapter 5, we close by examining the integration of new types of com-
plex biological data with variance component models. More speciﬁcally, we propose
a novel statistic, the smooth Euler characteristic transform (SECT), which is de-
signed to integrate shape information into standard statistical models. The SECT
allows us to represent shapes as a collection of vectors with little to no loss in infor-
mation. As a result, detailed shape information can be combined with biomarkers
such as gene expression in standard statistical frameworks, such as variance compo-
6

nent models. We illustrate the utility of the SECT in radiogenomics by predicting
disease free survival in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients based on the shape
of their tumor as assayed by magnetic resonance imaging. We show that the SECT
features outperform gene expression, volumetric features, and morphometric features
in predicting disease free survival. Lastly, we close this thesis with a discussion of
future directions, and some immediate challenges in building kernel based models in
statistical radiogenomics. This chapter is based on joint work with Anthea Monod,
Andrew Chen, Sayan Mukherjee, and Ra´ul Rabad´an (Crawford et al., 2016b).

Bayesian Approximate Kernel Regression with
Variable Selection
2.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we formulate a nonlinear regression framework which simultane-
ously achieves the predictive accuracy of the most common and powerful regression
methods in machine learning and statistics — kernel methods (Aronszajn, 1950;
de Boor and Lynch, 1966; Micchelli and Wahba, 1981; Schoenberg, 1942; Parzen,
1963; Wahba, 1990; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Evgeniou et al., 2000; MacKay, 2002;
Poggio and Girosi, 1990b; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006; Sch¨olkopf and Smola,
2001; Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004; Sollich, 2002; Tipping, 2001; Vapnik, 1998;
Zhang et al., 2011b) and Gaussian process regression models (Chakraborty et al.,
2012a; H´ajek, 1961, 1962; MacKay, 2002; Pillai et al., 2007; Rasmussen and Williams,
2006; Sollich, 2002; Tipping, 2001; Zhang et al., 2011b) — and provides an analogue
of eﬀect sizes and probability of association for regression coeﬃcients, standard in
linear regression models. Our objective is to develop a (Bayesian) nonlinear regres-
sion methodology that is computationally eﬃcient, predicts accurately, and allows
8

for variable selection.
Methodology and theory for variable selection in the linear regression setting is
far more developed than in the nonlinear regression setting. In linear regression, the
magnitude of regression coeﬃcients (i.e. the eﬀect size of a covariate) provides useful
information for variable selection. The magnitude and correlation structure of these
regression coeﬃcients are used by various probabilistic models and algorithms (Efron
et al., 2004; George and McCulloch, 1993a; Hahn et al., 2013; Park and Casella,
2008; Roman and Speed, 2002; Tibshirani, 1996; West, 2003) to select covariates
associated with the response. Classic variable selection methods, such as forward
and stepwise selection (Roman and Speed, 2002), use eﬀect sizes to search for main
interaction eﬀects. Sparse regression models, both Bayesian (Park and Casella, 2008)
and frequentist (Efron et al., 2004; Tibshirani, 1996), shrink small eﬀect sizes to zero.
Factor models use the covariance structure of the observed data to shrink eﬀect
sizes for variable selection (Hahn et al., 2013; West, 2003). Lastly, stochastic search
variable selection (SSVS) uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures to
search the space of all possible subsets of variables (George and McCulloch, 1993a).
All of these methods, except SSVS, use the magnitude and correlation structure of the
regression coeﬃcients explicitly in variable selection — SSVS uses this information
implicitly.
The main contribution of this chapter is a (Bayesian) nonlinear regression method-
ology that is computationally eﬃcient, predicts accurately, and allows for variable
selection. The main technical challenge in formulating this novel Bayesian nonlinear
regression model is how to deﬁne and eﬃciently compute an analogue of eﬀect sizes
in nonlinear kernel regression models. Kernel regression models have a long history
in statistics and applied mathematics (Aronszajn, 1950; de Boor and Lynch, 1966;
Micchelli and Wahba, 1981; Schoenberg, 1942; Parzen, 1963; Wahba, 1990). The
machine learning literature on kernel based methods is also extensive (Cortes and
9

Vapnik, 1995; Evgeniou et al., 2000; MacKay, 2002; Poggio and Girosi, 1990b; Ras-
mussen and Williams, 2006; Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2001; Shawe-Taylor and Cristian-
ini, 2004; Sollich, 2002; Tipping, 2001; Vapnik, 1998; Zhang et al., 2011b), and there
is also a large (partially overlapping) literature in Bayesian inference (Chakraborty
et al., 2012a; H´ajek, 1961, 1962; MacKay, 2002; Pillai et al., 2007; Rasmussen and
Williams, 2006; Sollich, 2002; Tipping, 2001; Zhang et al., 2011b). The key idea we
develop in this chapter is that for shift-invariant kernels in the p " n regime (the
number of variables p is much larger than the number of observations n) there exists
a linear (in the covariates) approximation to the nonlinear kernel model that is as
accurate as the nonlinear kernel model but for which eﬀect sizes can be computed.
We show that there exists a linear projection from the reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHS) to the space of the covariates that allows for this approximation.
This linear transformation is based on the fact that shift-invariant kernels can be
approximated by a linear expansion of random Fourier bases. The idea of random
Fourier expansions was exploited in B˘az˘avan et al. (2012) and Rahimi and Recht
(2007) to obtain kernel regression models that with superior runtime properties in
both training and testing in the regime where n " p. In this work we use the random
Fourier bases to eﬃciently compute the analogue of eﬀect sizes for nonlinear kernel
models.
The variable selection framework we develop in this work is implemented as a
Bayesian factor model that scales with large datasets. In section 2.8.6, we apply our
model to a dataset with 17,000 observations and 450,000 variables. It is challenging
to scale previous eﬀorts for variable selection in kernel models to large datasets since
inference on the relevance of a variable requires either solving non-convex optimiza-
tion problems (Chapelle et al., 2002; Poggio and Girosi, 1990a; Rakotomamonjy,
2003; Rosasco et al., 2013) or sampling using a Markov chain that typically mixes
poorly (Zhou et al., 2010; MacKay, 1998; Zhou et al., 2010). This is the main utility
10

of our variable selection framework: we can capture which variables are relevant in
nonlinear functions using factor models models coupled with a linear map.
In sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.4, we introduce properties of RKHS models and detail
some of the the basic functional analysis tools that allow us to map from the RKHS
of nonlinear functions to functions linear in the covariates. In sections 2.2.5 and 2.3,
we specify the Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR) model for nonlinear
regression and classiﬁcation with variable selection. In section 2.4, we deﬁne the
posterior probability of association analogue (PPAA) which provides marginal evi-
dence for the relevance of each variable. In section 2.5, we provide conditions under
which our methodology will result in a sparse linear regression model by reducing
our method to the compressive sensing framework. In section 2.8, we show the utility
of our methodology on real and simulated data. Speciﬁcally, we focus on how our
model addresses two important problems in statistical genetics: genomic selection
and association mapping. In section 2.9, we close with a discussion.
2.2
Bayesian Approximate Kernel Regression
In this section, we formulate the Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR)
model. Consider the following regression model
yi “ fpxiq ` εi,
εi
iid
„ Np0, σ2q,
where we are given n observations tpxi, yiqun
i“1of covariates xi P X Ď Rp and re-
sponses yi P Y Ď R.
We will be interested in the regime where the number of
variables is much larger than the number of observations, p " n. We will consider
two classes of regression functions in this chapter: linear functions and nonlinear
functions, speciﬁcally within an inﬁnite dimensional function space called a repro-
ducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
The intuition we formalize in this work is based on the following two observations
11

in the p " n setting: (1) smooth nonlinear functions often outperform both linear
functions, as well as sharply varying nonlinear functions, with respect to predictive
accuracy; (2) a smooth nonlinear function can be reasonably approximated by a linear
function. In the remainder of this section, we develop a framework that allows for
computationally eﬃcient inference of a smooth nonlinear function, and the projection
of the inferred nonlinear function onto the covariates — this projection will serve as
our analogue of eﬀect sizes in a linear model. We will use certain function analytic
properties of a speciﬁc type of RKHS to develop this regression framework. We will
also consider the RKHS to be deﬁned by a particular type of kernel function called
a Mercer kernel (Mercer, 1909).
2.2.1
Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
One can deﬁne a RKHS starting with a positive deﬁnite kernel function k : X ˆ
X Ñ R. The eigenfunctions tψiu8

operator deﬁned by the kernel function

can be used to deﬁne the RKHS. For a Mercer kernel (Mercer, 1909) the following
expansion holds
kpu, vq “

ÿ
i“1
λiψipuqψipvq,
(2.1)
and the RKHS can be deﬁned as as a linear combination of the bases tψiu8

as

where }f}K is the RKHS norm. We will deﬁne ψpxq as a vector called the feature
space, with basis elements t

i“1. We can also specify coeﬃcients c, a vector
12

with elements tciu8
i“1, in the feature space. The RKHS can now be deﬁned as the
following:
HK “

.
The above speciﬁcation of an RKHS looks very much like a linear regression model
except the bases are ψpxq rather than the unit basis, and the space can be inﬁnite-
dimensional.
Kernel regression models in machine learning (Evgeniou et al., 2000; MacKay,
2002; Poggio and Girosi, 1990b; Rasmussen and Williams, 2006; Sch¨olkopf and Smola,
2001; Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004; Vapnik, 1998; Zhang et al., 2011b) are
deﬁned by the following penalized loss function (Hastie et al., 2001, Section 5.8)

is the RKHS norm which serves as a complexity penalization, and λ is a tuning
parameter chosen to balance the trade-oﬀbetween ﬁtting errors and the smoothness
of the function. The popularity of kernel models is that the minimizer of (2.2) is a
linear combination of kernel functions centered at the observed data (Kimeldorf and

where txiun

and α “ tαiun

optimization problem into an optimization problem over n parameters. We denote
the subspace of the RKHS realized by the representer theorem as

To extract an analogue of eﬀect sizes from our Bayesian kernel model we will have
to relate representations (2.3) and (2.1). Indeed one can verify that c “ ΨXα.
2.2.2
Bayesian Models over HX
We will specify Bayesian models over the subspace of the RKHS induced by the
representer theorem, HX Ă H. The function space HX is data dependent and, hence,
priors over the function space are also data dependent. So formally our procedure
is not a coherent Bayesian procedure and more in the spirit of empirical Bayes.
There are interpretations and formulations of Bayesian kernel models that avoid or
mitigate this dependence on data (Liang et al., 2007, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010; Pillai
et al., 2007). However, we will restrict ourselves to placing priors over HX due to
computational eﬃciency. The restriction of HX to the span over the data will lead
to computationally eﬃcient methods that scale with the number of observations and
number of variables.
As the number of observations increases, the diﬀerence between the spaces HX and
H should decrease. In the approximation theory literature this diﬀerence }HX ´H}2
K
is the approximation error. A classic idea to characterize the approximation error as
a function of the number of observations n is to use Kolmogorov n-widths (Girosi,
1993; Pinkus, 1985). In our setting we can deﬁne the following Kolmogorov n-width
dnpHX, Hq “ EX sup

K,
which corresponds to the average worst approximation of H by HX. Some classic
results (Jones, 1992; Pinkus, 1985) suggest that dnpHX, Hq “ cn´s{p where c is a
14

constant, n is the number of observations, p is the dimensionality of the original
predictor variables, and s is a smoothness index of the kernel.
2.2.3

implemented variable selection by solving the following optimization problem

The joint optimization problem over pHτ, τq is nonconvex and does not scale well
with respect to the number of variables or the number of observations. In the case of
sampling algorithms the idea is to sample or stochastically search over the posterior

scape, and Markov chains typically do not mix well in this setting.

2.2.4
Random Fourier Features
In this subsection, we construct the approximate kernel which we will use to infer
the analogue of regression coeﬃcients. Again, we focus on the p " n scenario. The
key idea that will allow us to specify useful maps between the feature space and
predictor space is a variation on the randomized feature map developed in B˘az˘avan
et al. (2012) and Rahimi and Recht (2007).
The methods we develop will hold for kernel functions that are shift-invariant
kpu, vq “ kp}u ´ v}q and integrate to one
ş
kpzq dz “ 1 for z “ u ´ v. For these
shift-invariant kernels, Bochner’s theorem (Bochner, 1934) states that the kernel
function satisﬁes the following Fourier expansion
k p}xi ´ xj}q “

where ηωpxiq “ exppι ω⊺xiq, and the Fourier transform of the kernel function fpωq
is a probability density with

(2.5)
In other words, the eigenfunctions for these kernels can be thought of as Fourier
bases.
The idea of using Monte Carlo approximations of the kernel to speed computation
in kernel regression methods was developed in B˘az˘avan et al. (2012) and Rahimi and
Recht (2007). They considered the n " p setting and compared the standard kernel
representation of the solution to a Monte Carlo estimate using random bases

fpxq “ ˜ψpxq⊺c,
with ˜ψpxq being a vector of d Fourier bases with frequencies drawn from the den-
sity function (2.5). When one can accurately approximate the kernel function with
16

d ! n, then the Monte Carlo approximation results in much faster solutions to the
optimization problem and much faster evaluation of the regression estimates for new
observations.
The speciﬁc approximation in B˘az˘avan et al. (2012) and Rahimi and Recht (2007)
follows. The idea is to construct a random vector ˜ψpxiq “ r ˜ψ1pxiq, . . . , ˜ψdpxiqs⊺with
the following speciﬁcations
ωk

„ fpωq,
bk

b “ rb1, . . . , bds⊺P Rd,
(2.6)
˜ψpxiq “
c

d cos px⊺
i Ω` bq ,
where cos pvq of a vector v denotes element-wise cosines and (in the case of the
Gaussian kernel) fpωq is a p-dimensional multivariate normal. The kernel function
can then be considered a Monte Carlo estimate where
kpxi, xjq “ ψpxiq⊺ψpxjq « ˜ψpxiq⊺˜ψpxjq “ ˜kpxi, xjq .
(2.7)
We can also specify a matrix rΨ “ r ˜ψpx1q, . . . , ˜ψpxnqs with an approximate kernel
matrix rK “ rΨ⊺rΨ. The rate of convergence for the Monte Carlo estimate to the exact
kernel is Opd´ 1
2q and is dependent only on the random sampling size d (B˘az˘avan et al.,
2012). In this work we will set d “ p. The idea is to map from (1) an n-dimensional
space of kernel functions on the observations to (2) a p-dimensional space which we
can project onto (3) the p-coordinates of the explanatory variables to obtain eﬀect
sizes.
Note that in the construction we have proposed, the approximate kernel is con-
ditional on the random quantities tωk, bkud
k“1, which we can make explicit by the
following notation
˜kω,b ” ˜kpu, vq | tωk, bkud
k“1,
17

and (2.6) can be thought of as a prior over tωk, bkud
k“1. In a fully Bayesian model we
can also infer posterior distributions on the random kernel parameters tωk, bkud
k“1.
In this work, we will ﬁx the parameters tωk, bkud
k“1 and not consider them as part
of the inference problem due to computational advantages. Estimating the posterior
distribution on tωk, bkud
k“1 will signiﬁcantly increase computational cost and since we
know that the Monte Carlo error between the kernel and approximate kernel is very
small (Opd´ 1
2q), the eﬀect of a draw of tωk, bkud
k“1 on the posterior predictions, as
well as on the eﬀect sizes, will be minimal. For the rest of the chapter, we consider the
following approximation when we specify the approximate kernel ˜kpu, vq ” ˜kω,bpu, vq,
and for two runs of the model the diﬀerence in the approximate kernels will be
negligible.
2.2.5
Approximate Kernel Regression using Random Fourier Features
We now state the general framework for Bayesian approximate kernel regression
using random Fourier features.
In the next subsection, we will provide detailed
model speciﬁcations and posterior sampling algorithms for two settings: the standard
regression setting and binary classiﬁcation (see Appendix A.1 for an extension to a
mixed eﬀects setting).
A large class of loss functions in the penalized estimator (2.2) correspond to a
negative conditional log-likelihood (Chakraborty et al., 2012b; Poggio and Girosi,
1990b; Zhang et al., 2011b). For a standard linear model the following speciﬁcation
holds
yi „ ppyi | µiq
with
µi “ x⊺
i β,
(2.8)
with ppyi | µiq “ expt´Lpyi, x⊺
i βqu and training data tpxi, yiqun
i“1. We can adapt
the preceding speciﬁcation to posit a generalized kernel model (Chakraborty et al.,
2012b; Zhang et al., 2011b) based on the random kernel expansion in (2.6). Namely,
yi „ ppyi | µiq
with
g´1pµiq “ ˜ψpxiq⊺c,
(2.9)
18

where gp¨q is a link function. The above can be written in terms of the approximate
kernel matrix
yi „ ppyi | µiq
with
g´1pµiq “ ˜k⊺
i α,
(2.10)
where α “ rK´1 rΨ⊺c and we denote rK “ r˜k1, . . . , ˜kns, with ˜ki “ r˜kpxi, x1q, . . . , ˜kpxi, xnqs⊺.
In practice, the kernel matrix may be singular in which case we use a generalized
inverse to obtain α “ rK: rΨ⊺c, where rK: is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse.
To simplify notation we use rK´1 for both the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse as
well as the standard inverse.
The model in (2.9) is a generalized linear model (GLM), and the model speciﬁed
in (2.10) is often referred to as a generalized kernel model (GKM) (Chakraborty et al.,
2012b; Zhang et al., 2011b). Generalized kernel models provide a unifying framework
for kernel-based regression and classiﬁcation (Zhang et al., 2011b). Depending on
the application of interest, one may specify an appropriate likelihood ppyi | µiq and
link function g. For instance, in the linear regression case the likelihood is speciﬁed
as a normal distribution and the link function is the identity. In this chapter, we will
use this framework for linear and classiﬁcation applications.
Factoring the Kernel Matrix.
Since the kernel matrix K is symmetric and positive
(semi) deﬁnite, one can apply a variety of factor model methodologies (Crossa et al.,
2014; de los Campos et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010; Lopes and West, 2004; West,
2003).
The approximate kernel matrix rK is also symmetric and positive (semi)
deﬁnite, and thus satisﬁes the following spectral decomposition rK “ rUrΛ rU⊺, where
rU is an n ˆ n orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors and rΛ “ Diagpλ1, . . . , λnq is a
diagonal matrix of eigenvalues sorted in decreasing order. For numerical stability
and reduction of computational complexity, eigenvectors corresponding to smaller
eigenvalues can be truncated (de los Campos et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010; West,
19

2003); so without loss of generality we can consider rU resulting in a n ˆ q matrix of
eigenvectors and rΛ as a q ˆ q diagonal matrix of the top q eigenvalues. With this
new representation of the factor model, we rewrite Equation (2.10) as follows
yi „ ppyi | µiq
with
g´1pµiq “ ˜u⊺
i θ,
(2.11)
where ˜u⊺
i is the ith row of the factor matrix rU and θ “ rΛ rU⊺α is a q-vector of la-
tent regression parameters for the newly deﬁned explanatory variables. The reduced
orthogonal factor matrix is an orthonormal representation of the nonlinear relation-
ship between samples, and the coeﬃcients correspond to further dimension reduction
from n to q parameters. This representation can greatly speed up the estimation of
regression parameters, especially in the Bayesian paradigm when n is large.
Speciﬁcation of the Projection onto Explanatory Variables.
We now state the map that
allows us to project the nonlinear approximate kernel model onto the explantory
variables to provide the analogue of eﬀect sizes β. There are three sets of coeﬃcients
that are relevant in the nonlinear regression problem: (1) the eﬀect sizes β on the
original covariate space; (2) the coeﬃcients c of the random Fourier bases; and
(3) the reduced kernel coeﬃcients θ — the low dimensional representation used for
computational eﬃciency and numerical stability of the probabilistic model. Recall
that α “ rK´1 rΨ⊺c and θ “ rΛ rU⊺α. We then use the transformations deﬁned in
Equations (2.9)-(2.11) to specify the following relationship between θ and c
c “ prΛ rU⊺rK´1 rΨ⊺q´1θ.
Given this relation, one can derive the projection of c onto the predictor space to
obtain an analogue of β via Equations (2.8)-(2.9). We will refer to this term as ˆβ.
This projection is the following linear map
ˆβ “ X: rΨ⊺c,
(2.12)
20

where X: is the generalized inverse of X. In the above equations, when inverses are
not well-deﬁned we take the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse.
Identiﬁcation and uniqueness.
Throughout the rest of the chapter, all of our prior
speciﬁcation and modeling eﬀort will be placed on the kernel factor regression coef-
ﬁcients θ. Ideally, we would like a one-to-one map between the q-dimensional coef-
ﬁcients θ and the p-dimensional eﬀect size analogs ˆβ, as this avoids concerns with
identiﬁability and simpliﬁes interpretation. Identiﬁability issues are known to be a
challenge in interpreting factors in Bayesian factor models (West, 2003). For the con-
struction we have speciﬁed using the shift-invariant kernel, we can make some strong
claims about the uniqueness of the projection onto the predictors in the original
covariate space. Formally, we can state that the map from kernel factor parameters
θ to the analogue of eﬀect sizes ˆβ is injective — which implies identiﬁability of the
eﬀect sizes.
Claim 2.2.1. Consider an approximate shift-invariant kernel matrix rK that is strictly
positive deﬁnite with random feature map ˜ψ : Rp Ñ Rp. The map speciﬁed in Equa-
tion (2.12) is injective for any coeﬃcient vector in the restricted RKHS subspace,
c P HX.
Proof. The kernel matrix rK is positive deﬁnite. Let c1, c2 P HX be two diﬀerent
vectors in the restricted RKHS subspace. There exists δ P HX such that c2 “ c1 ` δ
with δ ‰ 0p
ˆβ1
“
X: rΨ⊺c1
ˆβ2
“
X: rΨ⊺c2 “ X: rΨ⊺pc1 ` δq
“
X: rΨ⊺c1 ` X: rΨ⊺δ,
because rK is positive deﬁnite, X: rΨ⊺δ ‰ 0p and ˆβ1 ‰ ˆβ2. So the map speciﬁed in
Equation (2.12) is injective for any c P HX.
21

Claim 2.2.2. Consider an approximate shift-invariant kernel matrix rK that is pos-
itive semideﬁnite with random feature map ˜ψ : Rp Ñ Rp.
The map speciﬁed in
Equation (2.12) is injective for any coeﬃcient vector in the span of the kernel ma-
trix, spanp rKq.
Proof. The kernel matrix rK is positive semideﬁnite. Let c1, c2 P HX be two diﬀerent
vectors in the restricted RKHS subspace. There exists δ P HX such that c2 “ c1 ` δ
with δ ‰ 0p. We now partition δ ‰ 0p into two components
δ “ δ∥` δK
where δ∥is in the span of rK and δK is not in the span of rK. We now consider
ˆβ1
“
X: rΨ⊺c1
ˆβ2
“
X: rΨ⊺c2 “ X: rΨ⊺c1 ` X: rΨ⊺δ∥` X: rΨ⊺δK.
By construction X: rΨ⊺δK “ 0p; so as long as the diﬀerence between c1 and c2 is in
the span of rK we have that ˆβ1 ‰ ˆβ2. When the diﬀerence is outside the span of rK
we have that δ “ δK and ˆβ1 “ ˆβ2.
2.3
Model speciﬁcation and Posterior Sampling
We now specify the Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR) and classiﬁ-
cation models (a mixed modeling extension can be found in Appendix A.1). We
will specify prior distributions in the kernel factor space that induce accurate and
interpretable estimation of eﬀect sizes in the original covariate space.
2.3.1
Bayesian Nonlinear Kernel Regression
Model speciﬁcation.
We ﬁrst state the standard kernel model using the approximate
kernel
yi “ ˜k⊺
i α ` εi,
εi „ Np0, σ2
εq,
(2.13)
22

where ˜ki is the ith row of the approximate kernel matrix rK. We will implicitly specify
priors over the coeﬃcients α. In general, we would like these priors to adaptively
shrink based on sample size (Zhou et al., 2010; Lopes and West, 2004; West, 2003).
A natural way to induce sample size dependent shrinkage and account for covariance
structure is using a g-prior (Liang et al., 2007, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010). We adopt
a standard approach in kernel based Bayesian models (Crossa et al., 2014; de los
Campos et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010; Lopes and West, 2004; West, 2003) that
uses g-priors to shrink the parameters proportional to the variance of the diﬀerent
principal component directions on the original covariate design space. We rewrite
the nonlinear regression model in Equation (2.13) in terms of its empirical factor
representation, as derived in Equation (2.11). Namely,
yi “ ˜u⊺
i θ ` εi,
εi „ N
`
0, σ2
ε
˘
,
θ “ rΛ rU⊺α.
(2.14)
Given this representation we specify the following hierarchical model:
yi “ ˜u⊺
i θ ` εi,
εi „ N
`
0, σ2
ε
˘
,
θ „ MVNp0q, σ2
θ rΛq,
σ2
θ „ Scale-inv-χ2pνθ, φθq,
σ2
ε „ Scale-inv-χ2pνε, φεq.
(2.15)
For the residual variance parameter σ2
ε we specify a scaled-inverse chi-square distri-
bution with degrees of freedom νε and scale φε as hyper-parameters. The regression
parameters are assigned a multivariate normal prior. The idea of prior speciﬁcation in
the orthogonal space on θ instead of α is referred to as the Silverman g-prior (Zhang
et al., 2011b). The parameter σ2
θ is a shrinkage parameter with a scaled-inverse chi
square distribution with degree of freedom νθ and scale φθ. This speciﬁcation for σ2
θ
and θ has the advantage of being invariant under scale transformations and induces
a heavier tailed prior distribution for θ when marginalization over σ2
θ. In particular,
23

σ2
θ allows for varying the amount of shrinkage in each of the orthogonal factors of
rK (Zhou et al., 2010). This mitigates the concern in principal component regression
that the dominant factors may not be those most relevant to the regression problem.
The model speciﬁed in Equation (3.11), coupled with the inverse of the projection
deﬁned in Equation (2.12), induces a multivariate normal prior on the analogue of
eﬀect sizes β in the original covariate space. This results in the following prior
β9 exp
"

2σ2
θ
β⊺pMrΛM⊺q´1β
*
,
(2.16)
with M “ X: rΨ⊺prΛ rU⊺rK´1 rΨ⊺q´1. In the case that M is singular, the induced prior
speciﬁcation for β is multivariate singular normal and Equation (2.16) is a member of
the class of generalized singular g-priors (Chien and Hsiao, 2013; West, 2003; Zhang
et al., 2011b).
Posterior inference and sampling.
Given the model speciﬁcation in Equation (3.11),
we use a Gibbs sampler to draw from the joint posterior ppθ, σ2
θ, σ2
ε | yq. In many
applications, the kernel function k is indexed by a band-width or smoothing param-
eter h, khpu, vq (B˘az˘avan et al., 2012; Chakraborty et al., 2012b; Zhou et al., 2010;
Rahimi and Recht, 2007; Zhang et al., 2011b), the Gaussian kernel for example can
be speciﬁed as khpxi, xjq “ expt´h´2}xi ´ xj}u. The bandwidth parameter can be
inferred; however, posterior inference over h is slow, complicated, and mixes poorly.
We work with a ﬁxed approximation of the kernel function allowing us to avoid this
computational cost. The parameters of interest are pθ, σ2
θ, σ2
εq. The Gibbs sampler
we propose consists of the following closed form conditional densities:
(1) θ | σ2
θ, σ2
ε, y „ MVNpm˚
θ, V˚
θq with V˚
θ “ σ2
εσ2

The second step is deterministic and maps back to the eﬀect size analogs ˆβ. Iter-
ating the above procedure T times results in the following set of posterior draws:

θptq, σptq
θ , σptq
ε , ˆβptq(T

2.3.2
Binary classiﬁcation
Assume binary response variables, yi P t0, 1u for i “ 1, . . . , n.
We specify the
following generalized kernel model
yi „ ppyi | µiq
with
g´1pµiq “ ˜k⊺
i α.
In the case of binary responses, typical link functions used for g are the probit or logit
functions. In this chapter, we use the probit link due to its tractability for calculating
marginal likelihood estimates. We will examine the BAKR framework using the logit
function in the next chapter. We now specify the hierarchical classiﬁcation model
yi “

εi „ Np0, 1q,
θ „ MVNp0q, σ2

σ2
θ „ Scale-inv-χ2pνθ, φθq.
(2.17)
Under this speciﬁcation, the responses in the kernel model are latent variables with
standard normal errors. We denote this vector of latent responses as s “ rs1 . . . sns⊺.
The Gibbs sampler for the model speciﬁed in (2.17) is a slight adaptation of the
25

sampler speciﬁed for nonlinear regression. The MCMC procedure detailed here is
similar to the standard posterior sampling scheme for probit regression developed in
Albert and Chib (1993). Posterior samples are generated by iterating the following
conditional densities:
(1) For i “ 1, .., n

Again, the second step is deterministic and allows for posterior inferences to be
made on the estimated coeﬃcients ˆβ in the original covariate space.
Iterating
the above procedure T times will result in the following set of posterior draws:
␣
θptq, σptq
θ , ˆβptq(T

2.3.3
Prediction
Prediction using BAKR is very similar to prediction in Bayesian parametric models.
Given a training set txi, yun
i“1 and a test set X˚ “ rx˚
1 . . . x˚
n˚s, a quantity of interest
is the posterior predictive distribution of the vector y˚ “ ry˚
1 . . . y˚
n˚s1. Given the
posterior draws
␣ˆβptq(T
t“1, a test set X˚, and an appropriate link function, samples
from the posterior predictive distribution y˚ | X˚, ˆβ, y are drawn as follows
!
y˚ptq “ g
´
X˚ ˆβptq¯ )T
t“1.
26

With sampled parameters at each iterate, we can generate posterior predictive quan-
tities and Monte Carlo approximations of marginal predictive means across a range
of new X˚ values (Zhou et al., 2010). If there is no test set, an MCMC driven leave-
one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method similar to the one presented in Chien and
Hsiao (2013) can be used.
There is a diﬀerence between the posterior predictive intervals computed in stan-
dard nonparametric models, such as Gaussian process regression, when compared
to BAKR. In the case of Gaussian process regression, the predictive distribution
y˚ | X˚, y is a normal distribution that depends on a kernel matrix which is evalu-
ated at all n`n˚ observations in a combined design matrix X Ť X˚. In our proposed
method, the implied posterior distribution on β depends only on the kernel matrix
evaluated at the training data X. There are advantages to both formulations. In
our BAKR formulation, when new samples are observed, we can simply plug-in the
estimates of the posterior distribution of β to obtain the posterior predictive dis-
tribution. In the Gaussian process setting, any new observations would need to be
incorporated in the model speciﬁcation and the posterior would need to be recom-
puted.
2.4
Variable Selection via Hard Thresholding
In many genomic applications an important objective is to determine how well a
given predictor is associated with a response. There are many approaches to com-
puting marginal statistics for each variable based on the eﬀect size estimate for each
variable. In the frequentist literature, these marginal statistics are typically p-values.
In the Bayesian literature two commonly used quantities are posterior probabilities
of association (PPAs) or posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) (Logsdon et al.,
2010; Barbieri and Berger, 2004; Stephens and Balding, 2009). In this subsection,
we will develop an analogue to PPAs, which we call the posterior probability of
27

association analogue (PPAA), based on a hard thresholding operator. In the next
subsection, we relate the hard thresholding operation applied to the eﬀect size ana-
logue to compressive sensing. We will also state under what conditions we can oﬀer
theoretical guarantees that the linear projection of the nonlinear function inferred is
sparse (i.e. the eﬀect size analogs are sparse).
The BAKR framework does not allow for a direct computation to PIPs and PPAs.
However, we show how to compute an analogue of PPAs, the PPAA, based on a hard
thresholding operation. Note that we could specify a similar computation to compute
PIPs. The idea of considering a posterior probability of the form Prr|β| ě z | ys ą c
— in which z and c denotes some eﬀect size and posterior probability thresholds
— was proposed as an alternative to conventional hypothesis testing in a series of
papers (Stephens and Balding, 2009; Pasanen et al., 2015; Shi and Kang, 2015) and
this quantity is compatible to the PPA and PIP when the posterior distribution of
|β| is assumed to be heavy tailed and centered at zero. We use a variation of an
adaptive thresholding technique used in Bayesian image analysis (Abramovich and
Benjamini, 1995; Rajankar and Talbar, 2014; Shi and Kang, 2015). The following
procedure to compute PPAAs can be added as a deterministic step to the MCMC
that computes eﬀect size analogs. Under the null hypothesis we assume Hpjq
0
: ˆβj “ 0
and we are given a signiﬁcance level λ:
1. Calculate the probability of a variable being associated under the null hypoth-
esis
ˆpj “ 2
˜
1 ´ Φ
˜
|ˆβj|
ˆσ
¸¸
j “ 1, . . . , p.
Here Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribu-
tion. The procedure is adaptive since σ is unknown and needs to be estimated.
We use the consistent median absolute deviation (MAD), ˆσ “ MAD{0.674.
28

2. Sort all of the probabilities corresponding to the variant eﬀect sizes in ascending
order as ˆp1 ď ˆp2 ď ˆp3 ď . . . ď ˆpp.
3. Compute j˚ as the largest j such that ˆpj ď
´
j
p
¯
λ.
4. For this j˚, calculate zj˚ “ ˆσΦ´1 ´
1 ´
ˆpj˚
2
¯
.
5. Threshold all |ˆβj| at the level zj˚.
This procedure allows allows us to compute a metric of evidence for each predictor
variable directly from posterior inference on eﬀect sizes, ˆβj. The posterior probability
of association analogue (PPAA) is given by the following equivalence
Prrˆγj “ 1 | ys ðñ Prr|ˆβj| ą zj˚ | ys,
(2.18)
where ˆγj is an indicator that predictor variable j is associated with the response.
The PPPA allows for posterior inferences on the relevance of each original covari-
ate. In statistical genetics applications, we can deﬁne candidate causal variables as
those covariates that satisfy tˆγ : Prrˆγ “ 1 | ys ą cu. This is analogous to the clas-
sical association studies that use p-values and PIPs. In practice, c may be chosen
subjectively (Hoti and Sillanpaa, 2006), or taken to be 0.5 in order to obtain the
equivalent of the “median probability model” (Barbieri and Berger, 2004). Another
option is to deﬁne c through k-fold permutation to ﬁnd an eﬀective predictor-wide
threshold. For any set of signiﬁcant variables, further analyses may be carried out
involving the relative costs of false positives and false negatives to make an explicitly
reasoned decision about which predictors to pursue (Stephens and Balding, 2009).
Equation (2.18) can be thought of as a hard thresholding operator. In the following
subsection, we provide conditions under which a sparse set of associated predictors
can be recovered using some standard arguments from the ﬁeld of compressive sens-
ing (Cand`es, 2006). Hard thresholding is a common method used in compressive
sensing to recover sparse signals (Blumensath and Davies, 2009).
29

2.5
Compressive Sensing and Sparse Eﬀect Sizes
One key to the hard thresholding operation is that it induces a sparse signal on which
variables are relevant. We now ask the question of under what conditions can we
state that ˆβ is sparse and accurately predicts the response. In this subsection we
adapt an argument developed in Cand`es et al. (2006) to provide conditions under
which sparse regression methods, like least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO), can be guaranteed to obtain a sparse set of regression coeﬃcients.
We ﬁrst state the optimization problem solved by the LASSO estimator ˆβ, written
as
min }β}ℓ1
subject to
}Xβ ´ y}ℓ2 ď ϵ,
(2.19)
where } ¨ }ℓ1 is the ℓ1-norm, X is the data matrix, and ϵ bounds the resolution of
noise in the problem. The main question of interest in Cand`es et al. (2006) was
under what conditions would β˚ be an accurate approximation of the minimizer βs,
or equivalently
min }β}ℓ0
subject to
}Xβ ´ y}|ℓ2 ď ϵ,
(2.20)
where } ¨ }ℓ0 is the ℓ0-norm or the number of non-zero elements, and ϵ bounds the
resolution of noise in the problem. We set s “ }βs}ℓ0. The key condition under which
a provably sparse approximation of βs exists is the restricted isometry property (RIP)
(Cand`es and Tao, 2005).
Deﬁnition 2.5.1 (Cand`es-Tao, 2005). For each integer s “ 1, 2, . . . , the isometry
constant δs of the matrix X is the smallest number such that
p1 ´ δsq}β}2
ℓ2 ď }Xβ}2
ℓ2 ď p1 ` δsq}β}2
ℓ2
for all s-sparse vectors β.
If we assume the true model generating the response vector is y “ Xβ˚ ` ε, where
30

ε is a vector of random errors. Then, given the RIP condition, the following result
provides a theoretical guarantee for sparse approximation (Cand`es et al., 2006)
Theorem 1 (Cand`es-Romberg-Tao, 2006). Assume that δ2s ď
?

where β˚ are the true coeﬃcients and s is the sparsity of the ℓ0-norm.
An ℓ1-minimization problem can be formulated for the kernel factor model coupled
with the linear map developed in BAKR with the estimator ˆθ, written as
min

(2.21)
where again M “ X: rΨ⊺prΛ rU⊺rK´1 rΨ⊺q´1, β “ Mθ, and θ are the parameters of the
Bayesian kernel factor model. The corresponding ℓ0-minimization problem results in
an estimator θs, given as
min

subject to
}XMθ ´ y}|ℓ2 ď ϵ,
(2.22)
where again s “ }Mθs}ℓ0. We will assume the following RIP condition.

Given optimization problems Equations (2.21) and (2.22) and the above RIP condi-

31

where θ˚ are the true coeﬃcients and s is the sparsity of the ℓ0-norm. The above
statement provides a theoretical guarantee on the sparsity of our eﬀect sample size
estimate given constraints on XM.
The BAKR model does not explicitly solve a penalized ℓ1-optimization problem.
Rather, we have a Bayesian formulation with priors for which the posterior distri-
bution on the eﬀect sizes should be heavy tailed. In addition, when we compute
PPAAs, we apply a hard thresholding step based on the following operator (Tavakoli
and Pourmohammad, 2012)

(2.23)
Rigorous results for recovering a sparse signal using iterative hard thresholding as an
alternative to ℓ1-regularization was developed in Blumensath and Davies (2009). For
Bayesian posterior inference the hard thresholding step Equation (2.23) can be added
as an additional step to the Gibbs sampling scheme outlined in Sections 2.3.1 and
2.3.2. At each MCMC iteration we decide to select coeﬃcients which are greater than
the speciﬁed threshold level z. In practice, z may be chosen subjectively (Stephens
and Balding, 2009; Pasanen et al., 2015), or calculated adaptively to control for false
discovery rates (Abramovich and Benjamini, 1995; Rajankar and Talbar, 2014; Shao
and Deng, 2012). For Bayesian posterior inference, the above may be implemented
as an additional step in the BAKR Gibbs sampling schemes. Speciﬁcally, at each
MCMC iteration we decide to select coeﬃcients which are greater than the speciﬁed
threshold level z. In practice, z may be chosen subjectively (Stephens and Balding,
2009; Pasanen et al., 2015), or calculated adaptively to control for false discovery
rates (Abramovich and Benjamini, 1995; Rajankar and Talbar, 2014; Shao and Deng,
2012).

2.6
Capturing Interaction Eﬀects and Epistasis
A key point of BAKR is to formulate a notion of eﬀect size for nonlinear functions.
In genetics applications, a nonlinearity of interest is interactions between covariates.
These interactions are called “epistasis,” which is the eﬀect of one gene being de-
pendent on the presence of one or more genes (the genetic background) (Howard
et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014; Zuk et al., 2012; W¨urschum et al., 2011; Zhang
et al., 2011a). These nonlinearities and interactions may be important in explaining
variation in the response. One approach to model epistasis is to explicitly include in-
teractions between all pairs of covariates in the model and obtain posterior samples of
the interactions. However, a priori, it is almost impossible to know how many higher
order interaction terms are needed to fully account for variation across an observed
response. More notably, if one considers many or all interactions the parametric
model becomes computationally infeasible to run and the variance of the estimates
increases as the model space grows very quickly. Shift-invariant kernels, such as the
Gaussian kernel, capture all higher order interaction terms between covariates (Jiang
and Reif, 2015).
Taylor expanding the approximate kernel results in the following expansion of
interaction terms between covariates
˜ψpxiq⊺˜ψpxjq “ 2

This expansion includes the typical additive relation between covariates, but also
includes all possible polynomial interactions.

2.7
Collinearity and Interpretation
Collinearity between covariates is important to consider when analyzing eﬀect sizes
estimated by a linear regression model. If not dealt with correctly, this issue can
cause problems with the interpretation of results for practical applications.
The
same concerns arise with respect to the interpretation of the eﬀect sizes estimated
by the BAKR. To mitigate some of these concerns we apply the following analogous
steps to those prescribed in linear regressions to reduce the eﬀects of collinearity
(Gelman and Hill, 2007):
(1) Centering the data: Before performing spectral decomposition and dimen-
sionality reduction, we center the approximate kernel matrix to ensure that
the ﬁrst principal component is proportional to the maximum variance of the
multidimensional data. The aim behind this is to reduce collinearity between
predictors in the basis space and RKHS — which we expect to implicitly reduce
collinearity between the original covariates.
(2) Orthogonalizing the data: The spectral decomposition of the approximate
kernel matrix achieves this step on the data.
(3) Variable selection: The g-prior speciﬁcation on the kernel factor coeﬃcients
induces shrinkage on the original covariate eﬀect sizes. Further variable selec-
tion may be carried out by enforcing sparsity across the original coeﬃcients via
thresholding as detailed in the previous subsection.
2.8
Results
We illustrate the utility of BAKR on both simulated and real data. The motivation
for both the simulations and real data examples is to understand the performance
of BAKR on two important problems in statistical genetics: genomic selection and
34

association mapping.
We use three simulation scenarios, corresponding to three
types of genetic architectures, to better understand the performance of BAKR in
predicting phenotypes from genotypes and in association mapping. We will show
that BAKR performs variable selection as well as commonly used Bayesian variable
selection methods, and predicts phenotypes from genotype data as well as the best
nonparametric models. We then consider the performance in predicting phenotypes
from genotypes and association studies in two large datasets: a stock mouse dataset
from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, and a large human GWAS
dataset from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC).
2.8.1
Simulation Studies
The simulation studies will focus on three types of regression models that capture
three diﬀerent types of genetic architectures: (1) a linear relationship between geno-
type and phenotype with unrelated individuals; (2) a nonlinear relationship between
genotype and phenotype with unrelated individuals; and (3) a linear relationship be-
tween genotype and phenotype with related individuals. We simulated 100 datasets
with n “ 500 samples and p “ 2000 covariates under each of the following three
scenarios:
I. Linear model without relatedness: The predictor variables are drawn from
a uniform distribution: x1, . . . , xp
iid
„ Up0, 1q. To generate the response variable,
we ﬁrst generate the eﬀect sizes. We assume the ﬁrst p0 “ 25 variables are
relevant to the prediction with βp1,...,p0q „ MVNp0, Ip0q and the remainder are
zero, βpp0`1,...,pq “ 0. The response is then generated as the following
y “ Xβ ` ε with ε „ MVNp0, Inq.
II. Nonlinear model without relatedness: We generate the predictor variables
35

using the same model as Scenario I. The response variables are created as
y
“
0.1rcos2pπx1 ˝ x2 ˝ x3q ` cos2pπx4 ˝ x5 ˝ x6qs `
0.2rsinpπx7 ˝ x8q ˆ sinpπx9 ˝ x10qs ` X11:25b ` ε,
where ε „ MVNp0, Inq, bj
iid
„ Up0.5, 1.5q for j “ 1, . . . , 15, and u ˝ v denotes
element-wise multiplication.
This nonlinear function was motivated by the
observation in Chipman et al. (2010) and Bleich et al. (2014) that variable se-
lection is diﬃcult to carry out in the presence of nonlinearities and interactions.
III. Linear model with relatedness: In this model, the observations are related.
We use the glSim function from the R package adegenet (Jombart, 2008) to
simulate related individuals from two distinct populations (i.e. the genotype
matrix X). We again assume the ﬁrst p0 “ 25 variables to be relevant and
responses are generated using the same linear model given in Scenario I.
2.8.2
Simulations: Variable Selection
We examine the performance of BAKR for variable selection as compared to four
other common Bayesian variable selection models on data simulated under scenarios
I, II, and III. The four Bayesian models are all implemented in the R package BGLR
(Crossa et al., 2014; Howard et al., 2014; de los Campos et al., 2009, 2010).
The models we compared included: (a) BAKR approximating a Gaussian kernel
with bandwidth parameter h “ 1, including all eigenvectors explaining 80% of the
cumulative variance in eigenvalues, and setting model hyper-parameters to ν “ 5
and φ “ 2{5; (b) Bayesian Lasso (Pasanen et al., 2015; Li et al., 2011a; Park and
Casella, 2008) with the hyper-parameters τ 2 of the double exponential drawn from
Gammapκ1 “ 0.55, κ2 “ 10´6q — this is consistent with other statistical genetics
simulations (de los Campos et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2013); (c) Bayesian ridge regres-
sion (Howard et al., 2014; Hoerl and Kennard, 2000) with a ﬁxed prior variance for
36

each variable; (d) Bayesian linear mixed model with the random eﬀects speciﬁed as
a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector 0 and covariance K “ XX⊺{p,
where K is referred to as a linear or additive kernel matrix (Jiang and Reif, 2015;
Keerthi and Lin, 2003); (e) Spike and Slab prior model (Guan and Stephens, 2011;
Zhou et al., 2013; Logsdon et al., 2010; Habier et al., 2011) which is speciﬁed as
a mixture of a point mass at zero and a diﬀuse normal centered around zero. For
all the models we sampled from the posterior distribution of β via a run for 50,000
MCMC iterations with a burn-in of 25,000 posterior draws. Longer MCMC chains
had little eﬀect with respect to inference for any of these models.
The accuracy of all methods were based on selecting “causal” predictor variables.
We compared the ﬁve models’ true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR)
(Bleich et al., 2014) with
TPR “
TP
TP ` FN
and
FPR “
FP
FP ` TN,
where TP is the number of true positives, FN is the number of false negatives, FP
is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives.
Figure 2.1 compares the power of all ﬁve methods under each simulation scenario.
Speciﬁcally, the plots depict the portion of causal variables discovered after prioritiz-
ing them in order according to their eﬀect size magnitude. All the methods perform
similarly when the responses are generated with independent predictors and unre-
lated samples (i.e. Scenarios I and II). As expected the performances of all methods
decrease when the response is a nonlinear function of the causal predictor variables.
There is a noticeable diﬀerence in the performance of the methods when the
variables are dependent and population structure is introduced to the simulations.
Consistent with previous studies (Logsdon et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2013), Bayes
Lasso and Spike and Slab have less power than the other three methods because they
do not account for covariance structure between the related samples. Bayes LMM
37

has a random component in the model that explicitly accounts for this underlying
structure. Bayes Ridge is a limiting case of the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP)
model (Ruppert et al., 2003), a linear mixed model that also corrects for population
structure and is commonly used in statistical genetics (Howard et al., 2014; Robinson,
1991; Morota et al., 2014; Jiang and Reif, 2015). BAKR uses the approximate kernel
matrix to model similarities between samples.
This matrix also serves as a self-
correcting term for underlying population structure and predictor dependence. It is
not surprising that Bayes LMM, Bayes Ridge, and BAKR perform well in Scenario
III.
Overall, BAKR’s competitive performance across all scenarios is empirical val-
idation that the method robustly identiﬁes causal predictors in variety of settings.
BAKR exhibits the ability to ﬂexibly handle many diﬀerent types of sample co-
variance structures, and also demonstrates robustness in the presence of predictor
collinearity. From an implementation perspective, there is a major advantage in us-
ing BAKR as it is computationally less expensive and utilizes a low-approximation
formulation and works in q-dimensions. The other methods we consider are forced
to conduct inference in at least the original p-dimensional covariate space.
2.8.3
Simulations: Out-of-Sample Prediction
BAKR can also be used for out-of-sample prediction.
Compared with standard
RKHS regression models, our method provides eﬀect size estimates to facilitate pre-
diction.
Using the same three simulation scenarios as described in the previous
subsection, we evaluate the predictive accuracy of BAKR again compared with the
Bayes Lasso, Bayes Ridge, and Bayes LMM. We also consider the support vector
machine (SVM) with a Gaussian radial basis function, which is a supervised RKHS
learning algorithm (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2001; Sollich, 2002; Wahba, 1997; Keerthi
and Lin, 2003; Howard et al., 2014; Evgeniou et al., 2000; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995;
38

Chapelle et al., 2002). We implement this model using the ksvm function in the
kernlab R package (Karatzoglou et al., 2004) under the “rbfdot” model setting. The
SVM estimates its parameters deterministically and does not require MCMC (see
Cherkassky and Ma (2004) for details).
For this simulation study, we used two metrics described in Hahn et al. (2013)
to compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy.
The ﬁrst is the mean square
prediction error (MSPE). The second is the tabulated frequency for which a given
method exhibits the lowest MSPE, which we denote as Pr[Optimal].
Numerical
results under both metrics are presented in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. BAKR performs
almost identical to the SVM across all three scenarios. This shows that the use of
the approximate kernel matrix does not hinder BAKR’s predictive accuracy in any
way. Unlike our method, the SVM is similar to other supervised kernel techniques and
cannot readily be used to infer the relevance of individual variables. The advantage
of BAKR is that it classiﬁes as well as the best methods, but also can infer the
relevance of variables.
Unexpectedly, the relative predictive performance for the three parametric meth-
ods diﬀers from the simulation results for variable selection. Speciﬁcally, Bayes Lasso,
Bayes Ridge, and Bayes LMM show noticeably low predictive accuracy in all sim-
ulation scenarios. BAKR consistently outperforms these three methods. This is in
contrast to the results we presented in the previous section, where we showed each
of these three models to have comparable inferential power to BAKR, even in the
presence of population structure and nonlinearities. A potential explanation for this
phenomena can be found in Zhou et al. (2013) and Shmueli (2010) where the authors
detail the diﬀerencss between variable selection and prediction problems. To eﬀec-
tively perform variable selection, it suﬃces to reliably rank predictors based on their
strength of association with the response. This may be done using any summary
statistic to describe a variable’s relevance (e.g. magnitude of an eﬀect size, posterior
39

probability, p-value). Accurate out-of-sample prediction, however, requires accurate
estimation of individual eﬀect sizes. The parametric models, especially Bayes Lasso,
tend to misestimate the exact size of eﬀects (Zhou et al., 2013), especially in the pres-
ence of nonlinearities (e.g. Scenario II). This fact is irrelevant in variable selection,
as long as only truly associated predictors are assigned more signiﬁcant summary
statistics than the non-causal ones. In out-of-sample prediction, however, this is not
enough and the misestimation of individual eﬀect sizes markedly reduces predictive
accuracy.
2.8.4
Genomic Selection and Genome-wide Association Studies
One motivation for BAKR was the desire for a methodology that simultaneously can
predict phenotypic variation from genotypic variation, as well as infer loci associated
with phenotypes. We illustrate that BAKR is useful for both tasks in this section
by outlining results in two datasets.
2.8.5
Genomic Selection in Stock Mice
We further assess BAKR’s predictive ability by analyzing 129 quantitative traits in
a heterogenous stock mouse dataset (Valdar et al., 2006) from the Wellcome Trust
Centre for Human Genetics (http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/mouse/HS/). The data
set contains n “ 1, 904 individuals from 85 families, all descended from eight inbred
progenitor strains Valdar et al. (2006). The data contains 129 quantitative traits that
are classiﬁed into 6 broad categories including behavior, diabetes, asthma, immunol-
ogy, haematology, and biochemistry. A total of p “ 12, 226 autosomal SNPs were
available for all mice. For individuals with missing genotypes, we imputed missing
values by the mean genotype of that SNP in their family. All polymorphic SNPs
with minor allele frequency above 1% in the training data were used for prediction.
We consider this particular dataset not only because it contains a wide variety of
40

quantitative traits, but also because the data contains related individuals. Related-
ness manifests diﬀerent orders of interaction eﬀects (Hemani et al., 2013; Zuk et al.,
2012), and thus this dataset presents a nice mix between our simulated Scenarios
II and III. We again compare Bayes Lasso, Bayes Ridge, Bayes LMM, SVM, and
BAKR across all the quantitative traits, where each phenotypic measure represents
a diﬀerent disease characteristic and broad-sense heritability.
For comparison in predictive ability, we follow previous works (Zhou et al., 2013;
Speed and Balding, 2014; Legarra et al., 2008; de los Campos et al., 2009) by dividing
the observations into roughly equal sizes for training and out-of-sample test sets. We
apply all ﬁve models using genotypes only, disregarding any other covariates. We
obtain posterior means or point estimates for eﬀect sizes in the training dataset,
and assess prediction performance using these estimates in the test set by MSPE.
We perform 100 of these splits for each phenotype to obtain a robust measure of
performance for each method.
The top panel of Figure 2.2 summarizes the prediction accuracy, measured by
MSPE, for each of the ﬁve methods across the 129 quantitative mice phenotypes.
We ﬁnd that the parametric models consistently exhibit the worst predictive per-
formance. Speciﬁcally Bayes Lasso, Bayes Ridge, and Bayes LMM had an average
MSPE of 1.00, 1.01, and 1.04, respectively. Consistent with our simulation study,
BAKR and SVM clearly perform the best with an average MSPE of 0.87 and 0.88,
respectively. In fact, BAKR and SVM were the optimal methods for 98% of the
phenotypes (i.e. 127 of 129 of the phenotypes). Overall, BAKR proved to be the
best model. It was the optimal method for 55% of the phenotypes.
In order to explain why BAKR and SVM outperformed the parametric models
in nearly all of the 129 phenotypes, we use a variance component analysis to eval-
uate the overall contribution of nonlinearities to the phenotypic variance explained,
or PVE (see Appendix A.2 for details). Brieﬂy, the basic idea for computing PVE
41

is using a linear mixed model with multiple variance components to partition the
phenotypic variance into four diﬀerent components: a linear component, a pairwise
interaction component, a third order interaction component, and a common environ-
mental component shared by mice within the same cage. Disregarding any random
noise, we quantify the contribution of the four components by examining the portion
of PVE (pPVE) explained by that component.
The bottom panel of Figure 2.2 displays the PVE decomposition. In this mouse
dataset, the common environmental component makes up a huge proportion of the
PVE for phenotypes where cage assignment and social interaction across mice matter.
In other words, the relatedness between the samples often greatly inﬂuences the
variation in each trait. For example, many of the phenotypes under the “diabetes”
and “immunology” categories include weight and protein measurements — all of
which depend heavily on the distribution of food and water, as well as the number of
mice in each cage. Another signiﬁcant ﬁnding in this plot, is that very rarely are the
linear and pairwise interaction components combined for the greatest contributors
in explaining variation in each response. In particular, the third order interaction
component also contributes a large proportion to phenotypic variance. For example,
when third order interaction eﬀects are considered, we ﬁnd that the mean pPVE for
the third order interaction component is 7%. In fact, the third order component
actually explains a larger proportion of phenotypic variance than either the linear
component or the pairwise component for 24 out of 129 quantitative mouse traits.
This variance component analysis highlights the importance of accounting for
population structure and modeling interaction eﬀects greater than second order ef-
fects. The prediction results presented here are unsurprising, given that the mice are
related and nonlinear eﬀects (beyond simple additive eﬀects) dominate the heritabil-
ity for many of the 129 quantitative mouse phenotypes. We again stress that the
advantage of BAKR lies in the explicit modeling of nonlinear relationships between
42

covariates and the desired response, as well as in accounting for relatedness between
samples.
2.8.6
Association Mapping in WTCCC Data
We apply BAKR to an association analysis of all seven diseases from the Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) 1 study (The Wellcome Trust Case Con-
trol Consortium, 2007) (http://www.wtccc.org.uk/). The WTCCC dataset has
been previously used for evaluating the power and ﬁne mapping capability of other
methods (Moser et al., 2015; Speed and Balding, 2014; Lippert et al., 2013; Franke
et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2009). These data set consist of about 14,000 cases of seven
common diseases, including 1,868 cases of bipolar disorder (BD), 1,926 cases of coro-
nary artery disease (CAD), 1,748 cases of Crohn’s disease (CD), 1,952 cases of hyper-
tension (HT), 1,860 cases rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 1,963 cases of type 1 diabetes
(T1D) and 1,924 cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as 2,938 shared controls.
We particularly selected a total of 458,868 shared single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) following a previous study Zhou et al. (2013).
For each disease, we provide a summary table in Supporting Information of Craw-
ford et al. (2016a) which lists all signiﬁcant SNPs that were detected by BAKR
(see Table S2; https://github.com/lorinanthony/BAKR). For this analysis, sig-
niﬁcance of association for a particular SNP or locus was determined by using the
posterior probability of association analogue detailed in Section 2.4. We then per-
form a twenty-fold permutation procedure to choose a genome-wide PPAA threshold,
which is used to determine the signiﬁcance of a given PPAA. This is done by permut-
ing the labels of the cases twenty times and choosing a trait-speciﬁc PPAA threshold
that corresponds to a 5% family-wise error rate (FWER) (see page 2 of Table S2 in
Crawford et al. (2016a)).
In Table 2.3, we compare BAKR’s ﬁndings to the loci and variants listed as
43

“strongly associated” in the original WTCCC study. Table A.1 features more of
this information in detail by displaying all BAKR-discovered loci for each trait. We
cross-reference BAKR’s results with discoveries made by other statistical methods
that were implemented on the same dataset (Kwon et al., 2014; Lippert et al., 2013;
Zanetti et al., 2015; Dandona et al., 2010; Feng and Zhu, 2010; Dolejsi et al., 2014;
Franke et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2013; Bradﬁeld et al., 2011; Eleftherohorinou et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2011a; Stahl et al., 2010). Figure 2.3 displays manhattan plots
of our genome-wide scan for all seven diseases.
Overall, BAKR identiﬁed 29 regions, 14 of which were highlighted in the original
WTCCC study as having strong associations and 3 others that were highlighted in
other studies analyzing the same data. BAKR missed 6 regions that were identiﬁed as
strong associations in the WTCCC study, but was also able to discover 12 potentially
novel regions in ﬁve of the seven diseases (CD, HT, RA, T1D, T2D). We restrict our
focus to only these novel ﬁndings.
Crohn’s Disease (CD). Variants spanning from 70.20Mb-70.29Mb on chromo-
some 10 are detected by BAKR as being associated with the disease. The leading
signiﬁcant SNP in this region with the highest PPAA is rs2579176. This variant, in
particular, has been reported as being upstream of DLG5, a gene which has been
found to be associated with perianal Crohn’s disease (de Ridder et al., 2007). This
gene was also validated (Zhang, 2012) as a member of a pairwise genetic interaction
that is very inﬂuential in the cause of the trait and hard to detect.
Hypertension (HT). The original WTCCC study did not report any regions
of the genome as strongly associated with hypertension. Moreover, across all other
compared studies, there does not appear to be much cohesion or obvious patterns in
the regions determined to be signiﬁcant. This is most likely due to a few reasons.
First, many of the studies we compare, including our own, work with diﬀerent vari-
ations of the same dataset (e.g. depending on data origin, preprocessing measures,
44

etc). Second, hypertension may be more susceptible to misclassiﬁcation bias due
to the presence of hypertensive individuals within the control samples (The Well-
come Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007). Hence, we could lessen the chance for
false positives if we excluded controls with elevated blood pressure. Nonetheless,
BAKR detected one locus as being moderately associated with the trait, marked by
rs762015. This locus is near the gene LOC100506412 — which is the same gene that
is reported to be near a moderately signiﬁcant locus found in the original WTCCC
study. However, because of the reasons we just mentioned, we do not feel conﬁdent in
speculating that this is a true associated region, and conclude that the locus reported
by BAKR is possibly a false positive.
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). BAKR identiﬁed 3.85Mb-4.16Mb on chromo-
some 17 as one potentially novel region associated with the disease. The leading
signiﬁcant SNP in this region with the highest PPAA is rs9913077. This variant is
upstream from ANKFY1, whose speciﬁc mechanistic function is unknown, but is a
notable member of the ankyrin repeat gene family. This particular family of genes
has been indicated to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (Stahl et al., 2010; Zher-
nakova et al., 2011; Okada et al., 2014) and thus suggests evidence that this ﬁnding
by BAKR may be a true positive.
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). BAKR identiﬁed seven new associated regions. On
chromosome 2, BAKR identiﬁes two regions marked by SNPs rs4147713 and rs6737675,
which are upstream of genes NDUFS1 and ABCA12, respectively. NDUFS1 has been
reported as being responsible for transferring electrons from the NADH to the respi-
ratory chain, while ABCA12 plays a role in lipid and ATP transfers (Akiyama et al.,
2005; Annilo et al., 2002). We note that both of these cellular mitochondrial func-
tions have been cited as becoming dysfunctional in the presence of type 1 diabetes
(Sivitz and Yorek, 2010). The closest gene to rs1618545, on chromosome 3, is TSEN2.
Nothing is known about the speciﬁc inﬂuence of TSEN2 on type 1 diabetes. There
45

is more indication that rs9302151 on chromosome 15 might be associated with the
disease, as it is known that the corresponding gene ATP8B4 is involved with ATP
transfer and phospholipid transport in the cell membrane (Harris and Arias, 2003).
Nothing is cited about the other SNPs rs1097157 and rs10934261 on chromosome 3,
or rs12660882 on chromosome 6, as it pertains to type 1 diabetes. We note that they
might be false positives, or the product of dependencies between SNPs that have yet
to be detected by previous methods based on linear assumptions. Type 1 diabetes
appears to be a more complex disease than hypertension, therefore we believe the
speculation of nonlinear and relatedness inﬂuence here to be more valid.
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). BAKR identiﬁes two previously unmentioned regions
on chromosomes 4 and 5, marked by SNPs rs7698608 and rs11167666, respectively.
The former is upstream of SLC9B1, which is a solute carrier gene that has not yet
been associated with type 2 diabetes. The latter SNP, on the other hand, is most
likely to be connected to relevant and insightful biology. This variant is near the
gene GALNT10, which has been previously been linked to the ﬂuctuation of body
mass index (BMI), obesity, and the cause of type 2 diabetes (Schwenk et al., 2013).

Discussion
We have presented a method for nonlinear regression that allows for eﬃcient and
robust variable selection. Our method, which we refer to as BAKR, builds upon
RKHS models that have been widely used for a variety of prediction tasks. However,
unlike standard RKHS models, BAKR exploits a connection between RKHS models
and linear regression models, that allows for estimation of a general eﬀect size for
each variable as a combination of its additive eﬀect and all its interaction eﬀects
with other variables. In a statistical genetics context, by modeling and inferring
the general eﬀect sizes under epistasis, BAKR can identify variables that exhibit
strong associations without the need to identify the particular variable combinations
46

that drive the potentially epistatic association.
Therefore, compared with other
association methods that capture interaction eﬀects (Lippert et al., 2013; Kwon et al.,
2014; Wan et al., 2010; Hemani et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010a, 2011a), BAKR avoids
any potentially large combinatory search space and improves statistical power. In
addition, compared with other multivariate regression methods (Zhou et al., 2013;
Yang et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2014; Lippert et al., 2011; Loh et al., 2015; Robinson,
1991; Kang et al., 2010; Zhou and Stephens, 2012; Wen, 2015), BAKR models the
general eﬀect sizes instead of the purely additive eﬀects. We have illustrated the
beneﬁts of BAKR in both simulations and real data applications.
In the present study, we have focused on demonstrating BAKR with a Gaussian
kernel. The Gaussian kernel eﬀectively assumes that the variation within a response
variable is contributed by linear, pairwise, and all higher-order interaction compo-
nents, where the proportion of contribution from these components decays depending
on the interaction order in a polynomial fashion. Because the Gaussian kernel models
higher-order interactions, BAKR can achieve higher power than other methods that
model only linear and pairwise interaction eﬀects. However, it is important to note
that the polynomial decay assumption made for the heritability contributions from
various genetic components in the Gaussian kernel may not be optimal for practical
genomic data analysis. In addition, the polynomial decay from the Gaussian kernel
is determined by a single rate parameter, which makes the Gaussian kernel not as
ﬂexible as one would expect. Indeed, diﬀerent traits likely have a diﬀerent genetic ar-
chitecture with heritability contribution from the linear, pairwise, and higher-order
interaction components that vary substantially across traits. Therefore, it is im-
portant to select a kernel function that can best capitulate the underlying genetic
architecture for a given trait.
BAKR’s framework is ﬂexible and can work eﬀectively with any kernel function
that is shift-invariant. Therefore, BAKR can be used with diﬀerent kernel choices —
47

such as the Mat´ern covariance function or the rational quadratic covariance function
which have been widely used in spatial statistics and machine learning literatures
(Minasny and McBratney, 2007; Cressie and Huang, 1999; Genton, 2002) — to enable
more powerful analysis. In addition, we can in principle directly model multiple
interaction components jointly and infer the contribution from each of them. For
example, in the simplest case, we could use two variance components, to estimate
the contribution from both linear and pairwise interaction components, respectively.
In practice, however, because of the potentially large number of parameters involved,
it is not always obvious whether it is better to model multiple components jointly
with a multiple component mixed model, or with a single kernel matrix that directly
ﬁxes the contribution from each genetic components.
In any case, exploring the
use of BAKR with other kernels and the beneﬁts in modeling diﬀerent aspects of
interaction and relatedness, is an important direction of future research.
A preliminary analysis of when BAKR may have provable guarantees based in
a compressive sensing argument was provided. There is a great deal of theoretical
analysis of our Bayesian procedure that remains. Interesting questions include for
what class of smooth functions will BAKR oﬀer accurate variable selection and pre-
diction, and how would the smoothness of the function class scale with the number of
observations n and dimensions p (Barron, 1993; Pinkus, 1985). The related approx-
imation theory question of what function classes are nonlinear, smooth, and project
reliably onto the predictor space with respect to variable selection is also interesting
and relatively unexplored.
There are many potential extensions of BAKR. We have only focused on analyzing
one response variable at a time in this study. However, it has been extensively shown
that modeling multiple responses can often dramatically increase power (Stephens,
2013; Zhou and Stephens, 2014). Therefore, it would be interesting to extend BAKR
to take advantage of response correlations to identify pleiotropic interaction eﬀects.
48

Modeling epistasis in the context of multiple phenotypes could be highly non-trivial,
as we need to properly model the shared epistatic component between phenotypes
in addition to the shared additive eﬀects between phenotypes. Modeling strategies
based on the multivariate linear mixed model (mvLMM) (Zhou and Stephens, 2014)
could be helpful here. In addition to its use in genetic association studies, BAKR
can also be applied to other association studies, such as eQTL mapping studies
(Pickrell et al., 2010). In these types of studies, SNP eﬀect sizes are on the gene
expression level and are often orders of magnitude larger than what is typically seen
on the organism trait level (e.g. GWASs). Thus, eQTL studies require a much smaller
sample size than GWASs and subsequently allow for the eﬃcient application of many
sophisticated models. Recent studies have started to reveal an initial set of epistatic
interactions that underlie gene expression variation (Huang et al., 2013; Becker et al.,
2012; Kapur et al., 2011). By adapting BAKR to eQTL studies, we expect to better
understand the genetic architecture that underlie gene expression variation.
BAKR is not without its limitations. Perhaps the most noticeable limitation is
that BAKR cannot be used to directly identify the component that drives individual
variable associations. In particular, after identifying an associated variable, it is often
unclear which component (linear vs. nonlinear) drives the association. Even in the
case where nonlinear-driven associations are present, it is still unclear which groups of
variables drive the association, and to which order they interact. Thus, despite being
able to identify predictors that are associated to a response in a nonlinear fashion,
BAKR is unable to directly identify the detailed interaction eﬀects. However, we
argue that being able to accurately detect predictors is often an important ﬁrst step
towards identifying and understanding the detailed associations. Moreover, being
able to identify individual predictor associations allows us to come up with an initial
likely set of associated predictors that are worth further exploration. Besides this
main limitation, we also note that BAKR can be computationally expensive. For
49

predictions, we only need to obtain the posterior mean of the general eﬀect sizes
and obtaining the mean requires a similar computing complexity as for an LMM.
However, for variable selection, we have to obtain the full posterior distributions
of the general eﬀect size of every predictor. Obtaining this posterior distribution
requires a costly inverse mapping step in each MCMC iteration. This inverse mapping
step has computational complexity that scales both linearly in the sample size and
linearly in the number of variables. As a result, though BAKR can easily deal with
tens of thousands of samples and millions of variables, new algorithms may be needed
to scale BAKR up for datasets that are larger in magnitude.

Bayes Ridge, and Bayes LMM had an average MSPE of 1.00, 1.01, and 1.04, re-

Identifying Genomic Drivers of Therapeutic
Resistance in Melanoma
3.1
Introduction
In the previous chapter, we illustrated the utility of generalized approximate kernel
models within the context of two key problems in statistical genetics: genomic se-
lection and association mapping. In this chapter, we will show how the same types
of methodologies can be implemented to help give insights into important problems
in cancer genomics and molecular biology.
More speciﬁcally, we will detail how
the BAKR modeling framework was used to identify signaling pathways that select
against therapeutic resistance in BRAF-mutant melanoma. As previously mentioned
in Chapter 1, the quantitative driven results presented here are part of a larger col-
laborative eﬀort that is forthcoming (Singleton et al., 2016). While some of this
collaborative work is outside the scope of this particular thesis, we will mention the
relevant biological ﬁndings that were discovered through experimentally validating
results derived from BAKR.
Recently, the treatment of metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma has been revo-
57

lutionized by two major new therapeutic modalities: targeted therapies (e.g. BRAF
and MEK inhibitors, BRAFi/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (e.g. PD-
1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors) (Wargo et al., 2014). Therapy with BRAFi/MEKi
yields high objective response rates, but diverse mechanisms of acquired resistance
limit the duration of these responses (Alcal´a and Flaherty, 2012; Robert et al., 2015;
Solit and Rosen, 2014; Wargo et al., 2014). In contrast, checkpoint inhibitors yield
lower response rates, but these responses are often durable (Larkin et al., 2015;
Wargo et al., 2014). Ongoing clinical trials are now investigating combinations of
BRAFi/MEKi with checkpoint inhibitors with the goal of simultaneously improv-
ing their duration and rate of response, respectively. However, emerging evidence
suggests that mechanisms driving resistance to BRAFi/MEKi may also drive cross-
resistance to checkpoint blockade through the suppression of tumor immune surveil-
lance, a point underscored by observations that patients who fail ﬁrst-line treatment
with BRAFi/MEKi appear to respond poorly to subsequent checkpoint blockade
(Ackerman et al., 2014; Frederick et al., 2013; Hugo et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016;
Wargo et al., 2014) (Puzanov et al., 2015, Pigment Cell Melanoma Res., abstract;
Ramanujam et al., 2015, Pigment Cell Melanoma Res., abstract; Simeone et al.,
2015, Pigment Cell Melanoma Res., abstract). These ﬁndings suggest that innova-
tive and robust strategies for preventing resistance to BRAFi/MEKi may not only
increase the durability of responses to ﬁrst-line therapy but also improve the activity
of emerging checkpoint blockade and combination strategies.
Extensive prior studies have identiﬁed diverse mechanisms of resistance to BRAFi/
MEKi in BRAF-mutant melanomas, including those that function by modulating the
initial adaptive tumor response (intrinsic resistance) and those selected for over time
(acquired resistance). Many resistance mechanisms, including activating mutations
in NRAS, MEK, and ERK, NF1 and CDKN2A loss, and ampliﬁcation or alterna-
tive splicing of mutant BRAF, result in reactivation of the ERK pathway in the
58

presence of BRAFi/MEKi (Alcal´a and Flaherty, 2012; Corcoran et al., 2010; Hugo
et al., 2015; Maertens et al., 2013; Nazarian et al., 2010; Poulikakos et al., 2011; Rizos
et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014a, 2012; Solit and Rosen, 2014; Van Allen et al., 2014;
Whittaker et al., 2013). Additionally, bypass mechanisms, including activation of
the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway through mutations or altered expres-
sion of IGF-1R, PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT, as well as through microenvironmental
changes, can drive resistance (Alcal´a and Flaherty, 2012; Fedorenko and Smalley,
2015; Hugo et al., 2015; Paraiso et al., 2011; Rizos et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014b,a;
Solit and Rosen, 2014; Villanueva et al., 2010). Similarly, bypass signaling through
the Notch1 pathway via altered expression of Notch1 and other pathway members
drives resistance in a third, distinct subset of patients (Martz et al., 2014). Impor-
tantly, these three pathways — ERK, PI3K and Notch1 — have been shown to drive
resistance to both single agent and combined BRAFi/MEKi and together appear to
account for 75% of acquired resistance cases while also playing important roles in
intrinsic resistance (Hugo et al., 2015; Martz et al., 2014; Moriceau et al., 2015; Wagle
et al., 2013). Finally, a “long tail” of alternative, rare resistance mutations and non-
genomic (transcriptional) alterations, including those aﬀecting the WNT/LEF1 and
Hippo/YAP pathways, are also likely to play important roles in resistance, although
the fractions of tumors aﬀected have yet to be deﬁned (Hugo et al., 2015; Lin et al.,
2015; Van Allen et al., 2014). In sum, the presence of multiple distinct pathways of
resistance, sometimes within the same patient or even the same tumor (Shi et al.,
2014a), suggests that the therapeutic inhibition of distinct resistance pathways is
likely to have only limited clinical value, and that more robust therapies may re-
quire simultaneous inhibition of multiple resistance pathways (Robert et al., 2015;
Solit and Rosen, 2014). Unfortunately, such higher order combination therapies are
expected to frequently produce unacceptable toxicities in patients, necessitating the
development of conceptually new approaches to circumvent resistance.
59

One such approach is based on the hypothesis that the seemingly distinct path-
ways driving resistance to BRAFi/MEKi may actually converge on one or more “com-
mon eﬀectors”: downstream signaling targets that are required for the development
and maintenance of resistance. This hypothesis is consistent with the notion of onco-
gene addiction (Settleman, 2012), which asserts that cancers develop dependencies on
signaling downstream of driver oncogenes, implying that resistance may require the
reactivation of these key downstream target(s). In melanoma, the “common eﬀector”
hypothesis also consistent with the observation that BRAFi/MEKi-resistant tumors
driven by diverse upstream signaling alterations exhibit highly recurrent transcrip-
tional programs (Hugo et al., 2015), suggesting potential downstream convergence.
Finally, this hypothesis is supported by recent data from our group and others demon-
strating that distinct mechanisms of resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
in lung and colorectal cancers converge on a single downstream signaling axis, the
targeting of which can forestall resistance (Hrustanovic et al., 2015; Misale et al.,
2015; Tricker et al., 2015).
In this study, we utilize BAKR by integrating the framework with genomic data
from a large cohort of BRAF-mutant melanoma patients with acquired resistance
to BRAFi, alongside diverse cellular models of BRAFi/MEKi resistance, to identify
the transcription factor MYC as a convergent downstream eﬀector of multiple ma-
jor resistance pathways that is required for both the evolution and maintenance of
resistance. By leveraging this insight alongside the concept of synthetic lethality,
we deﬁne combination therapies that, by selectively targeting the MYC-activated,
BRAFi/MEKi-resistant state, have the unique property of selecting against resis-
tance evolution and thereby represent promising new strategies to durably control
resistance.

3.2
Gene Expression of Melanoma Metastatic Samples
In this study, we collected microarray gene expression data (Rizos et al., 2014) that
included 59 BRAF V600-mutant melanoma metastatic samples taken from 30 patients.
More speciﬁcally, for these 30 patients, 38 of the 59 samples were taken on-relapse
(which we term as “progression”) and the remaining 21 were matched pre-treatment
samples. Only two patients, indexed as 5 and 10, were analyzed pre-treatment, on-
treatment, and on-relapse. In the current study, we only utilized the samples in
this dataset which had matched pre-treatment and progressed tumors (this included
patients 5 and 10). To increase the sample size of the on-treatment tumors used
to obtain the BRAFi/MEKi response signature, we also analyzed matched pre- and
on-treatment microarray gene expression data of melanoma cell lines from two sets of
data: M229, M238, and M249 (Nazarian et al., 2010); and SkMel1, SkMel5, SkMel19,
SkMel28, and Malme3M (Pratilas et al., 2009). Thus, in total, we used 68 samples:
29 pre-treatment samples; 10 on-treatment samples; and 29 on-relapse (progression)
samples. These data are publicly available and can be accessed in the NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus under the GEO SuperSeries accession numbers: GSE50509 (Ri-
zos et al., 2014), GSE24862 (Nazarian et al., 2010), and GSE10087 (Pratilas et al.,
2009).
3.2.1
Accounting for Potential Confounders
Data from Rizos et al. (2014) were obtained using the Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0
Expression Beadchip, while expression values from Pratilas et al. (2009) and Nazarian
et al. (2010) were obtained using by the Aﬀymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array and
the Aﬀymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array, respectively. Since the data came
from diﬀerent sources, as well as diﬀerent assays, we took the following preprocessing
and normalization steps to correct for batch eﬀects and other possible confounders.
61

First, using the annotations of each Aﬀymetrix/Illumina Chip/Platform, each probe
of each sample in each experiment was mapped to its corresponding HUGO gene
name and symbol. Next, assuming that there is no principled way to account for
“missingness”, we eliminate the probes that did not match to known genes. For
each sample in all three experiments, we follow previous works (Li et al., 2011b) and
took the probes that mapped to multiple genes and averaged their expression values.
Next, we identiﬁed the mapped genes that were common in all three chips/platforms
and only used these genes in subsequent statistical and pathway analyses. All three
datasets were RMA corrected and log2-transformed. We utilize base 2 because any
transformed 2-fold ratio will be converted to an ˘1 scale. This interpretation of fold
change helped with interpreting of BAKR regression coeﬃcients and the underlying
marginal covariate interactions. Lastly, we perform a ﬁnal cross-platform quantile
normalization (Rudy and Valafar, 2011) on the combined dataset. The goal of the
cross-platform normalization was to dilute some of the random noise created by chip-
to-chip batch eﬀects and strengthen biological signal in the data. After completing
these steps, we were left with a ﬁnal data set consisting of n “ 68 samples and p “
11,657 genes.
3.2.2
Data Phases I and II
The data were split into two phases: Phase I (i.e. generation of the BRAFi/MEKi
response signature) corresponded to pre-treatment versus on-treatment samples (n “
39); Phase II (i.e. identiﬁcation of genes that return to pre-treatment status) corre-
sponded to on-treatment versus post-treatment samples (n “ 39).
3.3
Logistic Bayesian Approximate Kernel Regression Model
In this section, we will use the Phase I dataset to infer a BRAFi/MEKi response
signature G of MAPK pathway addiction. In this chapter, we will use a logistic
62

version of the Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR-logit) model (Crawford
et al., 2016a) to derive this collection of genes. We assume that this methodology will
be advantageous in the cancer genomics setting for a few notable reasons. One, there
is no reason to assume a linear relationship between the changes in gene expression
and the eﬀect of a given therapeutic strategy. Moreover, crosstalk between signaling
pathways, as well as between the genes and nodes within these pathways, has been
suggested to be associated with drug response (Bender and Nahta, 2008; Yamaguchi
et al., 2014; Bostock, 2005).
More speciﬁcally, let X denote the observed n ˆ p
genotype matrix, where each element xij is the expression value of the jth gene from
the ith sample. Next, let y represent the following n-dimensional binary response
vector with
yi “
#
1
if
MAPK pathway is activated (pre-treatment);
0
if
MAPK pathway is deactivated (on-treatment).
Alternatively, we say that y is drawn as n-independent Bernoulli random variables,
such that yi
iid„ Bernpπiq.
Considering a logit link function between the gene expression and binary treat-
ment classes, we specify the following generalized approximate kernel model
logitpEryi | πisq “ logitpπiq “ logp
πi
1 ´ πi
q “ ˜k
⊺
i α,
where the deﬁnition for each component in the model is as previously deﬁned in
Chapter 2. To facilitate in the statistical inference and interpretation of this logistic
setup, we similarly follow Equation 2.17 and deﬁne a latent variable s “ rs1, . . . , sns⊺
such that yi “ 1 if si ą 0, and yi “ 0 otherwise Kinney and Dunson (2007). In
other words, each si is logistically distributed with location parameter ˜k
⊺
i α, with a
corresponding probability density function:
Lpsi; βq “
expt´psi ´ ˜k
⊺
i αqu
r1 ` expt´psi ´ ˜k
⊺
i αqus2.
(3.1)
63

It has been shown that this relationship is approximately a non-central tν-distribution
with location parameter ˜k
⊺
i α and scale parameter σ2
ε (Kinney and Dunson, 2007).
This means that we may express (3.1) as a scale mixture of normals, represented in
matrix notation as the following:

ε „ MVNp0, σ2
εΩ´1q,
(3.2)
where Ω“ Diagpω1, . . . , ωnq is an n ˆ n diagonal matrix.
We may now state the complete speciﬁcation of BAKR-logit. Since the approxi-
mation of any shift-invariant kernel matrix is also symmetric and semi-positive deﬁ-
nite, we again take advantage of the low-rank approximation of the nonlinear kernel
matrix rK to dramatically reduce computational cost (refer back to Section 2.2.5 in
Chapter 2). Recall, that this is done by using the spectral decomposition of the
approximate shift-invariant kernel matrix rK. More speciﬁcally,

(3.5)
where Γpa, bq is used to represent a Gamma distribution with shape a and rate
b. In practice, we follow Kinney and Dunson (2007) and ﬁx ν “ 7.3. Note that
we again utilize the empirical kernel factor representation where rK “ rUrΛ rU
⊺and
θ “ rΛ rU
⊺α.
For numerical stability and reduction of computational complexity,
eigenvectors corresponding to smaller eigenvalues were truncated (Liang et al., 2007,
2009; Pillai et al., 2007; Lopes and West, 2004; West, 2003); so without loss of
generality, we implement BAKR by considering rU to be an n ˆ q matrix containing
the eigenvectors of rK (i.e. rU rU
⊺“ In), and rΛ as a q ˆ q diagonal matrix of the
64

top q eigenvalues of rK. This consideration represented an even greater reduction in
required computation since q ď n ! p. In this study, we chose q to represent the
number of eigenvalues that explain 99% of cumulative variance in rK.
We again utilize the inverse mapping ﬁrst speciﬁed in Equation 2.12 in Chapter 2
to conduct posterior inferences on the eﬀect sizes β of the p-dimensional genes in the
original genetic space. Recall that these general eﬀect sizes are based on estimates
drawn from the posterior distribution of the kernel factor coeﬃcients ppθ | yq. Again
we implement this inverse projection mapping from the standard RKHS model to
original eﬀect sizes as a deterministic step in an MCMC Gibbs sampler — resulting
in an implied posterior distribution of β.
3.3.1

After a selection of initial values, samples of parameters and hyper-parameters were
drawn sequentially from their respective complete conditional posterior distributions,

MCMC samples from the BAKR-logit Gibbs sampler. These samples were selected
from a run of a 110,000 iterations, where we keep every 5th sample, and then follow
up with burn-in of 2,000 samples.
3.3.2
Variable Selection: Local False Sign Rate
We are reminded that the purpose of the BAKR-logit in this study is to discover a set
of genes G (i.e. a gene signature) whose expression levels robustly change following
treatment with a BRAFi/MEKi in BRAF-mutant melanomas. We used the estimate
of the original eﬀect sizes ˆβ as a metric of the relevance for each gene. Speciﬁcally,
the metric we used to determine the members of G is the local false sign rate (lfsr),
which is analogous to the local false discovery rate (Efron, 2007). The lfsr provides
a measure of conﬁdence in the sign of the eﬀect rather than conﬁdence of the eﬀect
being non-zero (Stephens, 2016). Alternatively, we say that we were more concerned
66

with controlling the minimization of “type S errors” (i.e. the errors of sign), rather
than the traditional type I errors (Gelman and Tuerlinckx, 2013). Therefore, we
choose to be conﬁdent in the directional change of a gene’s regulatory pattern (i.e. up-
regulation or down-regulation) in the presence of drug. Given posterior samples ˆβ
for each gene j, we deﬁned the corresponding local false sign rate as (Stephens, 2016)
lfsrj “ minrppβj ě 0 | y, ˆβq, ppβj ď 0 | y, ˆβqs.
(3.8)
This selection procedure is a post-hoc deterministic computation applied to the
MCMC samples of β. The BRAFi/MEKi response signature G is then deﬁned as
the set of genes that satisfy G “ tj : lfsrj ď zu. In this study, we subjectively choose
z “ 0.01. This resulted in a BRAFi/MEKi response signature of p˚ “ 68 genes.
3.4
Identifying Systematic Drivers of Relapse
Inference of MAPK signaling pathway activity was just the ﬁrst step in discovering
the genes and/or the cellular processes that are important for therapeutic resistance
and melanoma reoccurrence. To search for a potential convergent eﬀector of resis-
tance, we began by reasoning that such an eﬀector should follow two transitional
rules: (1) it should be regulated downstream of the driver oncogene and (2) it should
rebound to at least pre-treatment expression or activation states at resistance, in-
dependent of the upstream mechanisms driving resistance. We considered signature
genes that satisfy this criteria as a signature for patient relapse and we referred to
this set as R. Speciﬁcally, we used Bayes factors (BF) and marginal likelihoods to
determine which of the p˚ “ 68 members of G belonged in R.
3.4.1
Bayes Factor Computation
In this section, we develop the methodology for identifying an expression signature for
melanoma progression (i.e. the members of R). We begin by introducing the Bayes
factor, which is the probability of observing the data under one condition relative
67

to another (Kass and Raftery, 1995). In particular, we used the Phase II dataset
to obtain R. We redeﬁne the binary phenotype y˚, where now y˚
i “ 1 denotes a
progressed (relapsed) tumor and y˚
i “ 0 corresponds to a treated sample. Now let
ppy˚ | Mq be the probability of observing the phenotype under some model M, and
ppΘ˚ | Mq be a prior belief about that model’s parameters (i.e. gene coeﬃcients in
our case). The Bayes factor between two models M1 and M0 is then deﬁned as
BF10 “ ppy˚ | M1q
ppy˚ | M0q “
ş
ppy˚ | Θ˚
1, M1qppΘ˚
1 | M1qdΘ˚
1
ş
ppy˚ | Θ˚
0, M0qppΘ˚
0 | M0qdΘ˚
0
.
(3.9)
Here, the subscript identiﬁes which models are being compared, while the correspond-
ing order denotes which model is in the numerator and which is in the denominator.
As previously shown (Kass and Raftery, 1995; Rouder and Morey, 2012), the Bayes
factor is interpretable without recourse to additional criteria or qualiﬁcation.
We are particularly interested in individual members of the gene signature that
track that well with progression — meaning R Ď G. In other words, we want to
identify the genes that positively contribute to the explanation of melanoma reoc-
currence, conditioned on none of the other genes being present. The reason for this
approach is that we are strictly concerned with ﬁnding potential drivers of resistance.
This is accomplished by computing Bayes factors, while comparing an intercept term
(null model, M0) to the addition of each signature gene independently (alternative
models, Mj for j “ 1, . . . , p˚). Typically, Equation (3.9) can be computationally
expensive as one considers all possible combinations of explanatory variables. How-
ever, given the scope of the problem in question, our logic reduces this search to just
p˚ “ 68 Bayes factors that needed to be calculated. We deﬁne p˚ as the number of
genes included in our melanoma signature, (i.e. |G| “ p˚ “ 68).
We use the Laplace method Guan and Stephens (2008) to approximate the Bayes
factor for the binary responses. Assume that each phenotype is modeled by a logistic
68

regression model,
Mj :

(3.10)
where x˚
ij is the jth element of the ith row in the nˆg expression matrix X˚ containing
the treated and progressed samples from our data and the genes from our signature
(i.e. a subset of the Phase II dataset). This means that β˚
j is the eﬀect parameter
for the jth signature gene in G. Lastly, we deﬁne µ as a common intercept. Then
under the logistic function, Equation (3.10) can be stated as:
Mj :
π˚

where d is the dimension of the integral being approximated, Θ˚˚ is the value at
which h is at its maximum, and |HΘ˚˚| is the absolute value of the determinant
of the Hessian matrix of h evaluated at Θ˚˚. Under the null, M0, and alternative
models, Mj, respectively:
h pµq “ ℓpµ; y˚q ` log ppµq;
h pΘ˚q “ ℓpΘ˚; y˚q ` log p pΘ˚q .
The derivation of the Hessian matrices in each model case are given in full detail in
Guan and Stephens (2008).
Bayes Factor Interpretation and Results.
We compute the Bayes factor in Equation
(3.13) using the approximation in Equation (3.14) a total of p˚ times — each time
comparing one signature gene in G to the null model containing just the intercept.
Taking the log of each ratio j, we examined across results and considered genes with
logBFj0 ą 0 to track well with progression. Therefore, the set of signature genes
satisfying this condition are called relapse genes and are said to be members of the
set R. Alternatively, we say that R “ tj : logBFj0 ą 0u. Thirty-three genes were
associated with positive BF values — the highest of which was the proto-oncogene
MYC (see Figure 3.1(a)).
3.5
Follow-Up Numerical Experiments
To investigate the biological relevance of the signature G and drivers of relapse R,
we cross reference each member of the two sets with reference gene sets compiled in
70

the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) (http://software.broadinstitute.
org/gsea/msigdb) compiled by the Broad Institute (Subramanian et al., 2005a). We
used gene set enrichment methods to identify signaling pathways and/or cellular pro-
cesses that are over/underrepresented given a genetic signature (e.g. G, R) (Goeman
et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, this statistical approach points to whether or not signiﬁcantly
enriched/depleted groups have a higher association with a given phenotype than
what is expected by chance. Speciﬁcally, it utilizes a logistic regression model on ex-
pression measurements to describe the underlying molecular characteristics driving a
binary phenotype. The null hypothesis assumes that all regression coeﬃcients for the
members in a particular gene set are zero. Alternatively, we describe this procedure
as a test to see if the components within a tested gene set have substantial predictive
ability for classifying the targeted phenotypic response (Goeman et al., 2004). This
is determined by analyzing the random biological variation between subjects, rather
than comparing a gene set with random counterparts. As previously shown (Goeman
et al., 2006, 2011), this sort of global test is designed to have optimal power in sit-
uations where a particular gene set has many small non-zero regression coeﬃcients.
Hence, it is directed to ﬁnd gene sets for which many genes are associated with the
phenotype, even the relation is said to be minimal. We therefore use this model as
a way to look for “dysregulation” and diﬀerential expression among gene sets. We
consider a gene set to be dysregulated if it has a Bonferroni-corrected p-value below
0.05. Gene set analysis of the set of 68 signature in genes G appropriately revealed
numerous enriched signatures associated with the canonical RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
cascade. More interestingly, gene set analysis of the 33 resistant gene panel revealed
numerous MYC-related enriched gene sets.
MYC-mRNA expression in the modeled samples were decreased following initial
BRAFi treatment, then rebounded to pre-treatment or greater levels on resistance
(see Figure 3.2). By comparing these changes in MYC mRNA levels in matched pre-
71

treatment and post-relapse tumors with the expected change following BRAFi/MEKi
treatment, we calculated the probability of MYC rebound in each resistant tumor.
For this computation, we speciﬁcally looked at the percent change in MYC expression
between each pre-treated tumor and its matched relapse sample(s). The intuition
behind computing this change is that if MYC is said to be reactivated when a patient
relapses, then its expression levels should be about the same or greater in the corre-
sponding matched progressed tumors. For every patient i, we used the following to
compute the percent change in MYC expression:
%changepiq “ prepiq ´ postpiq
prepiq
ˆ 100%
for
i “ 1, . . . , n.
These percent changes were then standardized into z-scores and the probability of
reactivation was computed via the transformation 1´Φpzq, where Φ is the cumulative
distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Qualitatively, this value
Φpzq is similar to a lower one-tailed p-value and is interpreted as the probability of
seeing something more extreme than what has already been observed in the data. In
our context, this value can be deﬁned as the probability of seeing MYC deactivated
when a patient relapses. Therefore, we took the complement of a patient relapsing,
which we state as 1 ´ Φpzq, to represent the probability of seeing MYC reactivated
when a patient relapses. Progressed tumor samples that had probability above 0.5
(greater than random chance) were said to have MYC reactivated.
Strikingly, this analysis revealed ď90% probability of MYC rebound in 23 of 29
resistant tumors, and ď50% probability of MYC rebound in all 29 tumors despite the
fact that resistance in these tumors was putatively driven by a range of mechanisms
including the ERK, PI3K, and Notch1 pathways (see Figure 3.1(b)) (Martz et al.,
2014; Rizos et al., 2014).
72

3.6
Discussion
The importance of MYC in tumorigenesis has long been appreciated, dating to its
initial discovery through the investigation of oncogenic retroviruses (Sheiness et al.,
1978). One of the most commonly deregulated oncogenes, MYC’s activity is tightly
linked to major oncogenic signaling pathways. For example, the ERK and PI3K
pathways are believed to regulate MYC protein levels through direct phosphorylation
aﬀecting protein stability, while MYC activation downstream of Notch1 occurs via
transcriptional activation (Dang, 2012; Palomero et al., 2006; Sears, 2004). MYC ac-
tivation is linked to therapeutic resistance, for example in breast cancer cells treated
with PI3K pathway inhibitors and in c-Met-addicted cancers treated with c-Met in-
hibitors (Ilic et al., 2011; Muellner et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2015). In melanoma, our
quantitative ﬁnding that MYC is a nexus of convergent resistance is consistent with
a recent report that used network modeling to nominate MYC as a synergistic target
with BRAF, then veriﬁed this ﬁnding by demonstrating synergy between JQ1 and
vemurafenib treatment in a cell line Korkut et al. (2015). Our ﬁndings are also inter-
esting in light of a report suggesting that the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F)
complex may act as a point of convergence between the ERK and PI3K resistance
pathways in melanoma, as MYC and eIF4F interact in a well-characterized synthetic
lethal feedforward loop to support tumorigenesis (Boussemart et al., 2014; Lin et al.,
2008, 2012). The molecular mechanisms by which MYC is regulated by the major
pathways of resistance in melanoma, as well its key eﬀectors, are therefore impor-
tant areas for future study. These are the broad areas for which we further explore
through biological experimentation in the forthcoming Singleton et al. (2016).

Detecting Epistasis with the Marginal Epistasis
Test in Genetic Mapping Studies of Quantitative

4.1
Introduction
Recall that one of the most notable limitations of the BAKR framework is it’s inabil-
ity to directly identify speciﬁc components that drive individual variable associations.
In particular, in the case where nonlinear-driven associations (i.e. epistatic eﬀects)
are present, it is still unclear which groups of variables drive the association, and to
which order they interact. Thus, despite being able to identify predictors that are
associated to a response in a nonlinear fashion, BAKR is unable to directly identify
the detailed interaction eﬀects — a problem that is of particular interest in statis-
tical genetics and genomics. In this chapter, we present an alternative approach to
detecting signiﬁcant genetic interactions.
Diﬀerent existing statistical methods diﬀer in their ways of selecting a testing
unit (i.e. variants or genes (Ma et al., 2013)), their searching strategy (e.g. exhaustive
search (Zhang et al., 2010a; Lippert et al., 2013; Hemani et al., 2011) or probabilistic

search (Prabhu and Pe’er, 2012) or prioritization based on a candidate set (Lewinger
et al., 2013)), and the calculation of test statistics (e.g. various frequentist tests
(Ueki and Cordell, 2012) or Bayesian approaches (Zhang and Liu, 2007; Tang et al.,
2009)). However, almost all of these statistical methods focus on explicitly searching
for pairwise or higher-order interactions when identifying epistatic eﬀects. Because of
the extremely large search space (e.g. ppp´1q{2 pairwise combinations for p variants),
these methods often suﬀer from heavy computational burden and low statistical
power. Despite various eﬃcient computational implementations (Wan et al., 2010;
Hemani et al., 2011) and recently developed eﬃcient search algorithms (Prabhu and
Pe’er, 2012), exploring over a large combinatorial search space remains a daunting
task for large epistasis mapping studies. Statistically, because of a lack of a priori
knowledge of epistatic loci, exploring all combinations of genetic variants could result
in low statistical power — on the other hand, restricting to a subset of prioritized
combinations based on prior knowledge or marginal eﬀects could also miss important
genetic interactions.
Here, we present an alternative strategy for mapping epistasis. Instead of directly
identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on identifying
variants that have a non-zero interaction eﬀect with any other variants. To do so,
we develop a novel statistical method, which we refer to as the the “MArginal ePIs-
tasis Test” (MAPIT), to test each variant in turn on its marginal epistatic eﬀect
— the combined pairwise interaction eﬀects between a given variant and all other
variants. By testing marginal epistatic eﬀects, we can identify candidate markers
that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with
which the variants interact — thus, potentially alleviating much of the statistical
and computational burden associated with standard epistatic mapping methods. In
addition, evidence of marginal epistasis can be used to further prioritize the search
and identiﬁcation of pairwise interactions. Our method is based on variance com-
77

ponent models (Wu et al., 2011; Moser et al., 2015; Zhou and Stephens, 2012; Zhou
et al., 2013; Zhou and Stephens, 2014; Price et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010; Kang
et al., 2010; Lippert et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010b; Korte et al.,
2012; Meuwissen et al., 2001; Speed and Balding, 2014; Gusev et al., 2014; Speed
et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2011b; Loh et al., 2015; Pirinen et al., 2013; Yang et al.,
2014). By taking advantage of a recently developed variance component estimation
method (Zhou, 2016) for eﬃcient parameter inference and p-value computation, our
method is scalable to moderately sized genetic mapping studies. We illustrate how
MAPIT can serve as a useful alternative to standard methods in mapping epistasis
with both simulations and a real data application.
4.2
MAPIT Model
We describe the MArginal ePIstasis Test in detail here. Our goal is to identify vari-
ants that interact with other variants, and to avoid explicitly searching for pairwise
interactions. Therefore, unlike standard tests for epistasis, MAPIT works by exam-
ining one variant at a time. For the kth variant, we consider the following linear
model,
y “ µ ` xkβk `
ÿ
l‰k
xlβl `
ÿ
l‰k
pxk ˝ xlqαl ` ε,
ε „ MVNp0, τ 2Iq,
(4.1)
where y is an n-vector of phenotypes for n individuals; µ is an intercept term; xk is
an n-dimensional genotype vector for the kth variant that is the focus of the model;
βk is the corresponding additive eﬀect size; xl is an n-dimensional genotype vector
for the lth variant, and l represents any of the p variants other than the kth; βl is
the corresponding additive eﬀect size; xk ˝ xl denotes an element-wise multiplication
between genotype vectors, thus representing the interaction term between the kth and
lth variants; αl is the corresponding interaction eﬀect size; ε is an n-vector of residual
errors; τ 2 is the residual error variance; I is the identity matrix; and MVN denotes
78

a multivariate normal distribution. In addition, we assume that the genotype vector
for each variant has been centered and standardized to have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1.
The model in Equation (4.1) is an underdetermined linear system (p ą n). There-
fore, we have to make additional modeling assumptions on the eﬀect sizes βl and αl
to make the model identiﬁable. To do so, we follow standard approaches (Yang et al.,
2010; Wu et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013) and assume that each individual eﬀect size
follows a normal distribution, or βl „ Np0, ω2{pp ´ 1qq and αl „ Np0, σ2{pp ´ 1qq for
l ‰ k. With the normal assumption on eﬀect sizes, the model in Equation (4.1) is
equivalent to the following variance component model,
y “ µ ` xkβk ` mk ` gk ` ε,
ε „ MVNp0, τ 2Iq,
(4.2)
where mk “ ř
l‰k xlβl is the combined additive eﬀects from all other variants, and
eﬀectively represents the additive eﬀect of the kth variant under the polygenic back-
ground of all other variants; mk „ MVNp0, ω2Kkq with Kk “ X´kX⊺
´k{pp ´ 1q
being the genetic relatedness matrix computed using genotypes from all variants
other than the kth; gk “ ř
l‰kpxk ˝ xlqαl is the summation of all pairwise interac-
tion eﬀects between the kth variant and all other variants; and gk „ MVNp0, σ2Gkq
with Gk “ DkKkDk representing a relatedness matrix computed based on pairwise
interaction terms between the kth variant and all other variants. Here, we denote
Dk “ diagpxkq to be an n ˆ n diagonal matrix with the genotype vector xk as its
diagonal elements. It is important to note that both Kk and Gk change with every
new marker k that is considered.
We want to point out that the formulation of MAPIT in Equation (4.2) can also
be easily extended to accommodate other ﬁxed eﬀects (e.g. age, sex, or genotype
principal components), as well as other random eﬀects terms that can be used to
account for sample non-independence due to other genetic or common environmental
79

factors. In addition, we choose to model βk as a ﬁxed eﬀect here, but modeling it as
a random eﬀect is straightforward. Also note that, in this work, we limit ourselves
to only consider second order epistatic relationships between SNPs. However, the
generalization of MAPIT to detect higher order interactions is straightforward and
only involves the manipulation of Gk.
4.2.1
Point Estimates
Our goal is to identify variants that have non-zero interaction eﬀects with any other
variant. To do so, we can examine each variant in turn (k “ 1, . . . , p) and test the
null hypothesis in Equation (4.1) that variant k has no interaction eﬀect with any
other variant, H0 : α1
l “ 0 @ l ‰ k. This same null hypothesis is speciﬁed in the
variance component model stated in Equation (4.2) as H0 : σ2 “ 0. The variance
component σ2 eﬀectively captures the total epistatic interaction eﬀects between the
kth variant and all other variants — we call this the marginal epistatic eﬀect for the
kth variant.
Testing the marginal epistatic eﬀect σ2 requires jointly estimating the variance
component parameters (ω2, σ2, τ 2) in Equation (4.2). The standard method for vari-
ance component estimation is the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML)
method. However, REML is computationally slow: it requires an iterative optimiza-
tion procedure where the time complexity of each iteration scales cubically with the
number of individuals (Yang et al., 2011a; Zhou and Stephens, 2012, 2014; Yang
et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2010; Lippert et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2006; Zhang et al.,
2010b). The slow computation speed of REML is further exacerbated by the fact
that the variance component model changes for every variant k (i.e. both Kk and Gk
are variant speciﬁc) — hence, the variance component parameters are required to be
estimated over and over again across genome-wide variants. Therefore, we cannot
use REML for marginal epistatic mapping. Instead, we follow the recently developed
80

MQS method (Zhou, 2016) for eﬃcient variance component estimation and testing.
MQS is based on the method of moments and produces estimates that are mathe-
matically identical to the Haseman-Elston (HE) cross-product regression (Haseman
and Elston, 1972; Drigalenko, 1998; Sham and Purcell, 2001; Sham et al., 2002).
Note that MQS is not only computationally more eﬃcient than HE regression, but
also provides a simple, analytic estimation form that allows for exact p-value com-
putation — thus alleviating the need for jackknife re-sampling procedures (Golan
et al., 2014) that both are computationally expensive and rely on incorrect individ-
ual independence assumptions (Churchill and Doerge, 2008).
To estimate the variance components with MQS, we ﬁrst multiply a projection
matrix Mk on both sides of the model in Equation (4.2) to remove the inﬂuence of
µ and xk. Here, Mk “ I ´ bkpb⊺
kbkq´1b⊺
k, where bk “ r1n, xks with 1n denoting an
n-vector of ones. Thus, Mk is a variant speciﬁc projection matrix onto both the null
space of the intercept and the corresponding genotypic vector xk. By multiplying
Mk, we obtain the following simpliﬁed modeling speciﬁcation

changes with every new marker k that is considered.
To simplify notation, we use δ “ pω2, σ2, τ 2q to denote the variance components.
Next, we use the notation Σk “ rΣk,1, Σk,2, Σk,3s “ rK˚
k, G˚
k, Mks. Lastly, we use
indices i, j, l P t1, 2, 3u to represent the corresponding variance component or covari-
ance matrix. Given estimates pΣk, we can obtain the MQS estimates for the variance
components of each variant pˆδk,1, ˆδk,2, ˆδk,3q “ pˆω2

matrix in which Sk,ij “ traceppΣk,i pΣk,jq for every i, j, l “ 1, 2, 3.
4.2.2
Hypothesis Testing
MAPIT provides two options to compute p-values. The ﬁrst option is approximate,
and is based on a normal test that only requires the variance component estimate
ˆσ2 and its corresponding standard error. In particular, the variances of the MQS
estimates in Equation (4.4) are given via a previously suggested and computationally
eﬃcient approximation (Zhou, 2016)
Vpˆδk,iq « 2y˚⊺

(4.5)
where Vk “ ˆω2

k ` ˆσ2

kMk. Given an estimate from Equation (4.4) and
its standard error from Equation (4.5), we can perform a normal test (or z-test) to
compute p-values. More speciﬁcally, we use a two sided test since the MQS estimates
can be either positive or negative. The normal test is computationally eﬃcient, but
it is important to stress that when the sample size is small it is not appropriate.
We also provide a second, exact option to compute p-values which is valid in
the cases of small sample sizes. This second option relies on the fact that the MQS
variance component estimate in Equation (4.4) follows a mixture of chi-square dis-
tributions under the null hypothesis.
This is because y˚ is assumed to follow a
multivariate normal distribution under the modeling assumptions.
In particular,

with pˆω2

0 q being the MQS estimates of pω2, τ 2q under the null hypothesis. We can
then use the Davies method (Davies, 1980; Wu et al., 2011) to compute p-values.
82

While the Davies method is the appropriate test of choice and is expected to
produce calibrated p-values, it can become computationally demanding as the num-
bers of observed samples becomes large (see Table B.1). Speciﬁcally, the computa-
tional complexity of the normal test scales linearly with the number of markers and
quadratically with the number of individuals. On the other hand, the computational
complexity of the Davies method scales linearly with the number of markers, but cu-
bically with the number of individuals. Therefore, the Davies method can be much
slower than the normal test. For example, while analyzing 10,000 markers on a data
set with 1,000, 2,500 and 5,000 individuals, the z-test version of MAPIT requires
an average of 2.1, 18.9, and 67.6 minutes, respectively. Using the Davies method
on these same sets of data, MAPIT requires about 6.1, 108.6, and 654.9 minutes,
respectively. Therefore, in practice, we suggest a hybrid p-value computation pro-
cedure that uses the normal test by default, and then applies the Davies method
when the p-value from the normal test is below the threshold of 0.05. The hybrid
procedure combines the advantages of the two diﬀerent tests and produces calibrated
p-values while remaining computationally eﬃcient (again see Table B.1). As we will
also show in the results section, the above MQS estimation and testing procedures
allow for both accurate and eﬃcient marginal epistatic mapping in moderately sized
genetic mapping studies.
4.2.3
Comparative Approaches
In this work, we compare MAPIT to two diﬀerent epistatic mapping approaches. The
ﬁrst is a single-SNP additive association analyses which is ﬁt with a linear regression
model by using the -lm argument in the GEMMA software (Zhou and Stephens, 2012;
Zhou et al., 2013; Zhou and Stephens, 2014). This software is publicly available at
http://www.xzlab.org/software.html. The second identiﬁes pairwise interactions
directly by implementing an exhaustive search linear model, which we ﬁt by using the
83

--epistasis argument in the PLINK software (version 1.9) (Purcell et al., 2007).
This software is also publicly available at https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/
epistasis.
Besides estimating and testing marginal epistatic eﬀects for every SNP, we also
explore the use of a variance component model to estimate the total contribution of
pairwise epistasis onto the phenotypic variance (Henderson, 1985; R¨onneg˚ard et al.,
2008; Jiang and Reif, 2015). More speciﬁcally, we consider a linear mixed model
which partitions the total phenotypic variance using variance components corre-
sponding to additive and pairwise epistatic covariance matrices:
y “ g1 ` g2 ` ε,
ε „ MVNnp0, τ 2Inq
(4.6)
where g1 „ MVNnp0, ω2Kq is the linear eﬀects component; g2 „ MVNnp0, σ2K2q
is the pairwise interaction component; and ε represents the proportion of pheno-
typic variance explained by random noise. Here, we let tω2, σ2, τ 2u be corresponding
random eﬀect variance terms. The matrix In is an n ˆ n identity matrix. The co-
variance matrix K “ XX⊺{p is the conventional (linear) genetic relatedness matrix,
as previous deﬁned. The covariance matrix K2 “ K ˝ K represents a pairwise inter-
action relationship matrix, and is obtained by using the Hadamard product (i.e. the
squaring of each element) of the linear kernel matrix with itself (Henderson, 1985;
R¨onneg˚ard et al., 2008; Jiang and Reif, 2015). Notice that this formulation is very
similar to that which was used to partition the PVE of the mice phenotypes from the
Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics that we presented in Results of Chapter
2 (again see Appendix A.2).
For this chapter, in the presence of population structure and potential stratiﬁ-
cation eﬀects, we modify Equation (4.6) by including the top 10 genotype principal
components as ﬁxed eﬀects. The modiﬁed variance component model can be ﬁtted
through the following steps. First, we collect top 10 PCs in a covariate matrix Z.
84

Next, we compute a projection matrix M “ I ´ ZpZ⊺Zq´1Z⊺, and multiply it on
both sides of the model in Equation (4.6) to get the following transformed model:
y˚ “ g˚
1 ` g˚
2 ` ε˚
(4.7)
where y˚ “ My; g˚
1 “ Mg1; K˚ “ MKM; g˚
2 “ Mg2; K2˚ “ MK2M; and
ε˚
k “ Mε, respectively.
We apply the ﬁrst procedure to simulations, and the second procedure to both the
simulations and real data analyses. In either case, our goal is to estimate the inﬂuence
of the total contribution across pairwise epistatic eﬀects have on the phenotype. Once
again, we quantify these contributions by examining the proportion of phenotypic
variance explained (pPVE) using the same equation deﬁned in Appendix A.2, but
this time with Σ “ rK˚, K2˚, Ms. In the current study, we speciﬁcally calculate the
pPVEs corresponding to the random eﬀect variance terms ˆδ “ pˆω2, ˆσ2, ˆτ 2q. We again
reiterate the interpretation that the variance component that explains the greatest
proportion of the overall PVE then represents the most inﬂuential eﬀect onto that
particular phenotypic response. We also use the standard output (i.e. point estimate
and standard error) to conduct an asymptotic normal test to assess the power of this
approach.
4.3
Results
4.3.1
Simulations: Type I Error Control
To validate MAPIT and our proposed hybrid testing procedure, in terms of control-
ling type I error, we carried out a simulation study. Here, we again make use of
the control samples from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC)
(The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007) mentioned in Chapter 2. Re-
call that this portion of the data originally consists of 2,938 individuals with 458,868
SNPs following the quality control steps described in detail in a previous study (Zhou
85

et al., 2013). Speciﬁcally, we utilize the genotypes from chromosome 22 of these con-
trol samples to generate continuous phenotypes. Exclusively considering this group
of individuals and SNPs leaves us with an initial dataset consisting of n “ 2,938
control samples and p “ 5,747 markers.
In order to investigate the type I error control, we ﬁrst subsample from the geno-
types for n “ 1,000, 1,750, and 2,500 subjects.
Next, we randomly select 1,000
causal SNPs and simulate continuous phenotypes by using the following two sim-
ulation models: (i) a standard model with y “ Xβ ` ε, and (ii) a population
stratiﬁcation model with y “ Zu ` Xβ ` ε, where X is the genotype matrix, Z
contains covariates representing population structure, and u are ﬁxed eﬀects. Under
the ﬁrst model, we simulate both the additive eﬀect sizes of each causal SNP and
the random noise term from a standard normal distribution, and then we scale the
two terms further to ensure a narrow-sense heritability of 60%. In the second model,
we introduce population stratiﬁcation eﬀects into the simulations by allowing the
top 5 and 10 genotype principal components (PCs) to make up 10% of the overall
phenotypic variance (i.e. through the Zu term). These population stratiﬁcation ef-
fect sizes are also drawn from a standard normal distribution. Note that, for both
settings, the idea of the null model holds because there are no interaction eﬀects, and
MAPIT solely searches for signiﬁcant marginal epistatic eﬀects that are a summation
of pairwise interactions. Furthermore, in the cases in which simulations were con-
ducted under model (ii), the genotype PCs were not included while running MAPIT,
and no other preprocessing normalization procedures were carried out to account for
the added population structure. All evaluations of calibration and type 1 error are
strictly based on the linear mixed model presented in Equation (4.2).
We assess the calibration of MAPIT under both the normal test and the Davies
method for each sample size n. Figure 4.1 shows the quantile-quantile (QQ) plots
based on simulation model (i), with the application of MAPIT to these null datasets
86

under both hypothesis testing strategies. Similar QQ-plots for data simulated under
model (ii) can be found in Appendix B (see Figure B.1). The normal test heavily
relies on the assumption of asymptotic normality — therefore, it is expected to see
improvement of performance as the sample size increases. However, as one also ex-
pects, the normal test is inaccurate in the extreme tails of the test even for larger
sample sizes — hence, the inﬂation of the normal test p-values in Figure 4.1. Al-
ternatively, utilizing the Davies method via a mixture of chi-squares allows MAPIT
to robustly control for type I error across all sample sizes — even in the presence of
population stratiﬁcation eﬀects. MAPIT’s ability to produce calibrated type I error
in the presence of population stratiﬁcation is not surprising, as the model of MAPIT
contains a genetic relatedness matrix that has been well known to eﬀectively control
for population stratiﬁcation (Kang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2014). Table 4.1 shows
the empirical type I error rates estimated for MAPIT at signiﬁcance levels α “ 0.05,
0.01, and 0.001, respectively, for simulations under model (i). Again, similar tables
for data simulated under mode (ii) can be found in Appendix B (see Tables B.2 and
B.3). As expected based on the QQ-plots under the Davies method, MAPIT con-
trols the type I error rate for reasonably sized datasets, and can be slightly liberal
when the sample size is small. Presumably, the liberal behavior of p-values in small
samples arises from the fact that frequentist tests do not account for uncertainty in
the variance component estimates in the null model. Based on the null simulation
results, the Davies method should be the choice of default. However, for computa-
tional reasons, we use a hybrid p-value computation procedure (details in Section
4.2.2) that recalibrates p-value for a SNP using the Davies method when the z-test
p-value for the SNP is below the nominal threshold of 0.05. The results we present
throughout the rest of the chapter will be based on using MAPIT with this hybrid
approach.
87

4.3.2
Simulations: Estimating and Identifying Marginal Epistatic Eﬀects
In this section, we use simulation studies to illustrate the advantages of MAPIT in
identifying marginal epistatic associations. In addition, besides correctly detecting
marginal epistatic associations, we will show that MAPIT can also estimate the
marginal epistatic eﬀects reasonably well. Therefore, analogous to SNP heritability
estimation settings (Yang et al., 2010; Speed et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013), these
variance component estimates can serve as a measurement of the marginal interaction
phenotypic variance explained (PVE) by each epistatic causal variant (Zhou, 2016).
To test the power of MAPIT, we again consider simulation designs similar to
those proposed by previous epistatic analysis studies (Wan et al., 2010). First, we
assume that the broad-sense heritability is known (H2 “ 0.6) (Pilia et al., 2006; The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007; Zhou et al., 2013). Next, we use
the 22nd chromosome of all control cases from the WTCCC 1 study X (i.e. n „ 3,000
and p „ 6,000) to simulate continuous phenotypes that mirror genetic architectures
aﬀected by a combination of additive and pairwise epistatic eﬀects. Speciﬁcally, we
randomly choose 1,000 causal SNPs to directly aﬀect the phenotype and classify the
causal variants into three groups: (1) a small set of interaction SNPs, (2) a larger set
of interaction SNPs, and (3) a large set of additive SNPs. In the simulations carried
out in this study, SNPs interact between sets, so that SNPs in the ﬁrst group interact
with SNPs in the second group, but do not interact with variants in their own group
(the same rule applies to the second group). One may view the SNPs in the ﬁrst set
as the “hubs” in an interaction map. We are reminded that interaction (epistatic)
eﬀects are diﬀerent from additive eﬀects. All causal SNPs in both the ﬁrst and second
groups have additive eﬀects and are involved in pairwise interactions, while causal
SNPs in the third set only have additive eﬀects.
The additive eﬀect sizes of all causal SNPs again come from a standard normal
88

distribution or β „ MVNp0, Iq. Next, we create a separate matrix W which holds the
pairwise interactions of all the causal SNPs between groups 1 and 2. These SNPs
have eﬀect sizes also drawn as α „ MVNp0, Iq. We scale both the additive and
pairwise genetic eﬀects so that collectively they explain a ﬁxed proportion of genetic
variance. Namely, the additive eﬀects make up ρ%, while the pairwise interactions
make up the remaining p1 ´ ρq%. Once we obtain the ﬁnal eﬀect sizes for all causal
SNPs, we draw errors to achieve the target H2. The phenotypes are then created by
summing all eﬀects using two simulation models: (i) y “ Xβ ` Wα ` ε and (ii)
y “ Zu`Xβ `Wα`ε, where Zu again represents population stratiﬁcation. In the
latter model, population stratiﬁcation eﬀects are introduced into the simulations by
allowing the top 5 and 10 genotype principal components (PCs) Z to make up 10%
of the overall variation in the trait. The eﬀect sizes for these stratiﬁcation eﬀects are
also drawn as u „ MVNp0, Iq.
We consider a few scenarios that depend on two parameters:
• p1´ρq, which measures the portion of H2 that is contributed by the interaction
eﬀects of the ﬁrst and second groups of causal SNPs. Speciﬁcally, the pheno-
typic variance explained (PVE) by the additive genetic eﬀects is said to be
VpXβq “ ρH2, while the PVE of the pairwise epistatic genetic eﬀects is given
as VpWαq “ p1 ´ ρqH2.
• p1{p2{p3, which are the number of causal SNPs in each of the three groups,
respectively.
Speciﬁcally, we set ρ “ t0.5, 0.8u and choose p1{p2{p3 “ 10/10/980 (scenario I),
10/20/970 (scenario II), 10/50/940 (scenario III), and 10/100/890 (scenario IV).
Note that scenarios III and IV assume a larger number of interactions than scenario
I and II do, and are thus likely to be closer to reality. The particular case where
ρ “ 0.5, the additive and epistatic eﬀects are assumed to equally contribute to the
89

broad-sense heritability of the simulated phenotypes. The alternative case in which
ρ “ 0.8 is a case where the PVE of the simulated complex traits are dominated
by additive eﬀects. We analyze 100 diﬀerent simulated datasets for each value of
ρ, across each of the four scenarios.
All of the results described in this section
are based on the cases in which phenotypes were simulated under model (i) with
ρ “ 0.8, as this case is a more realistic setting for human traits where epistatic
eﬀects only make up a small percentage of the broad-sense heritability. The results
for ρ “ 0.5 can be found in Appendix B (see Figure B.2). Similar results for all data
simulated under model (ii) can also can be found in Appendix B (see Figures B.3
and B.4). Once again, note that in the cases for which simulations were conducted
under model (ii), the genotype PCs were not included while running MAPIT, and
no other preprocessing normalization procedures were carried out to account for the
added population structure. All evaluations of MAPIT are strictly based on the
linear mixed model presented in Equation (4.2).
Figure 4.2(a) shows the power results for MAPIT’s ability to detect both group
1 and 2 causal variants, respectively, compared across each simulation scenario. Em-
pirical power of MAPIT was estimated as the proportion of p-values below 0.05. We
can see MAPIT’s ability to detect both groups of causal markers depends on the
pairwise interaction PVE explained by each variant. For example in Figure 4.2(a),
each causal variant in group 1 is expected to explain VpWαq{p1 “ 1.2% of the true
interaction PVE since in every scenario p1 “ 10. In these situations, the cumulative
PVE of these markers is great and MAPIT’s power is large for all four scenarios
(approximately 30% power). Note that this power is similar to MAPIT’s ability to
detect the group 2 causal markers under Scenario I (i.e. p2 “ 10), where each epistatic
variant is also expected to explain VpWαq{p2 “ 1.2% of the interaction PVE. Al-
ternatively, MAPIT exhibits half of the power when detecting the group 2 SNPs in
the case of Scenario II (i.e. p2 “ 20), as each SNP explains only VpWαq{p2 “ 0.6%
90

of the PVE (approximately 15% power). In addition, MAPIT’s power to identify
group 1 variants is independent of the number of variants in group 2 (i.e. p2), sug-
gesting that MAPIT’s power depends on the total interaction eﬀects, rather than
individual pairwise eﬀects or the number of interacting pairs. The results based on
the genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold are similar and can be found in Appendix B
(see Figures B.5 and B.6).
While our main focus is on testing and identifying epistasis, we also assess
MAPIT’s ability to estimate the contribution of each group 1 and 2 causal SNP to the
interaction PVE. Figure 4.2(b) show boxplots of these estimates. The true interac-
tion PVE explained by each causal SNP is depicted as the grey dashed lines. These
plots show that even though MAPIT’s power is directly aﬀected by the epistatic
contribution to the phenotypic variation, its ability to correctly estimate the eﬀects
of causal interacting SNPs is robust and approximately unbiased. It is important
to note that we see MAPIT maintain its estimation ability even when the portion
of PVE explained by a set of causal SNPs is very small (i.e. group 2 SNPs in sce-
nario IV). The estimation results are consistent with the well-known robustness of
variance component models in estimating PVE in other settings (e.g. estimation of
SNP heritability) (Yang et al., 2010; Speed et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013). Finally,
further deviating from our main focus, we also apply a standard variance compo-
nent model to partition the phenotypic variance into an additive component and an
epistatic component following the approach of (R¨onneg˚ard et al., 2008; Henderson,
1985; Jiang and Reif, 2015) (details in Section 4.2.3). Results show that the stan-
dard variance component model can also be used to estimate the total contribution
of epistasis reasonably well (see Figure B.7), and produces reasonable power at the
signiﬁcance level of 0.05 with a standard asymptotic normal test (see Figure B.8).

4.3.3
Simulations: Power Comparisons
Here, we compare the performance of MAPIT with a standard exhaustive search
procedure that examines all pairwise interactions to explicitly identify the exact
pairs of variants involved in epistatic interactions (Lippert et al., 2013; Hemani et al.,
2011). Speciﬁcally, for the exhaustive search, we consider the PLINK linear model
y “ µ ` xiβi ` xjβj ` pxi ˝ xjqαij ` ε and test H0 : αij “ 0 for every marker
combination of i and j in turn (Purcell et al., 2007). Keeping notation consistent, xi˝
xj denotes element-wise multiplication between genotypes i and j, and αij represents
the eﬀect size of their interaction.
Note that the exhaustive search procedure is
computationally feasible within PLINK because we only have p „ 6, 000 markers in
the simulations.
It is helpful to point out here that the purpose of this comparison is to depict
MAPIT as a viable alternative for the exhaustive search procedure. We will show
that MAPIT not only can perform a signiﬁcance test to detect variants involved in
epistasis, but also can be used to obtain a prioritized set of variants that are further
used to identify pairwise interactions. Our simulation comparisons are thus targeted
to illustrate how MAPIT can be used in these two tasks, and how its performance
diﬀers from the exhaustive search procedure in diﬀerent scenarios.
Identifying variants involved in epistasis.
We ﬁrst compare MAPIT against the PLINK
exhaustive search method in identifying variants that are involved in epistasis. For
this task, MAPIT can directly perform a signiﬁcance test and produce a p-value.
Here, we note that the power of MAPIT and the exhaustive search method are de-
termined by diﬀerent factors: the power of the linear interaction method depends
on each individual epistatic interaction eﬀect size αij, while the power of MAPIT,
as we have shown in the previous section, depends on the marginal epistatic eﬀects
92

— the summation of interaction eﬀects. Therefore, we would expect MAPIT and
the exhaustive search method to be advantageous in diﬀerent situations (if the ex-
haustive search method is computationally feasible). In particular, we would expect
the exhaustive search method to be more powerful in scenario I (and II) where each
individual interaction eﬀect is large, and MAPIT to be more powerful in scenario (III
and) IV where each individual interaction eﬀect is small but the marginal epistatic
eﬀect remains large.
Furthermore, MAPIT can naturally account for population
stratiﬁcation via the included genetic relatedness matrix, while the exhaustive search
method requires including genotype PCs as covariates to control for such confounding
eﬀects. Therefore, we would also expect MAPIT to be robustly more powerful when
there are confounding population stratiﬁcation eﬀects that are not explicitly taken
into account. To validate our expectations, we again generate continuous outcomes
using the same two previously described simulation schemes: (i) y “ Xβ ` Wα ` ε
and (ii) y “ Zu ` Xβ ` Wα ` ε. Once again, all results described in the main text
are based on model (i) with ρ “ 0.8, while all other results can be found in Appendix
B (see Figures B.9-B.13).
We evaluate MAPIT’s and PLINK’s ability to accurately identify marginal epistatic
eﬀects for markers in each of the two causal groups. The criteria we use compares the
false positive rate (FPR) with the rate at which true variants are identiﬁed for each
model (TPR). Figure 4.3 depicts the ability of MAPIT and PLINK to detect causal
variants in groups 1 and 2. In particular, these plots depict the portion of causal
markers discovered after prioritizing all of those considered in order of their signiﬁ-
cance. We assess the marginal epistatic detection in the PLINK exhaustive search by
ﬁrst running the previously described pairwise linear model, ordering the resulting
p-values for each possible interaction, and drawing a power curve for identifying the
SNPs that are members of simulated causal groups 1 and 2. For example, if the
top p-values from the exhaustive search are interactions SNP1-SNP2, SNP2-SNP3,
93

SNP4-SNP5, and only SNP2 is the true causal epistatic variant, then the top three
pairs only marginally identify 1 true variant and 4 false variants.
As expected, while the power of MAPIT depends on the pairwise interaction PVE
explained by each SNP, the power of the exhaustive search depends on the individual
interaction eﬀect size. For example, the power of the exhaustive search to detect
group 1 causal epistatic SNPs is dependent on the number of group 2 causal SNPs,
which also determines the interaction eﬀect size in simulations. Therefore, while the
exhaustive search exhibits higher power in the sparse scenario where there are only a
small number of interactions each with a large eﬀect size (e.g. scenarios I and II), its
power quickly decays in the more polygenic scenario where there is a large number of
interactions, each with a small eﬀect size (e.g. scenarios III and IV). MAPIT is able
to perform well in the more realistic polygenic scenarios (III and IV) by modeling the
marginal epistatic eﬀects of each variant, allowing the detection of epistatic variants
not to be dependent on the individual pairwise interaction eﬀect size. Importantly,
MAPIT remains powerful even in the presence of population stratiﬁcation, as it can
eﬀectively control for population stratiﬁcation with the included genetic relatedness
matrix. In contrast, the exhaustive search approach in PLINK does not explicitly
control for population stratiﬁcation, and can suﬀer from power loss in the presence
of stratiﬁcation especially when the total epistatic contribution (i.e. 1 ´ ρ) is small
(see again Figures B.11 and B.13).
We are reminded that another advantage to MAPIT is the reduced space it must
search over, as MAPIT only requires p tests for a data set with p genetic markers.
Therefore, MAPIT is expected to exhibit a computational advantage over this type
of exhaustive search approach in moderate size genetic mapping studies with millions
of markers.
94

Identifying pairwise interactions.
Although we have focused on identifying marginal
epistatic eﬀects so far, MAPIT can also be used to facilitate the identiﬁcation of
pairwise (or high-order) epistatic interactions. In addition to comparing MAPIT
with the exhaustive search method from PLINK, we also consider another common
approach for identifying epistatic pairs — a two-step ﬁltering association mapping
procedure (Wei et al., 2014; Lippert et al., 2013; Lewinger et al., 2013). These types
of ﬁltering methods often ﬁrst apply a marginal (additive) single-SNP test (Moser
et al., 2015; Zhou and Stephens, 2014) to identify associated genetic variants with
non-zero additive eﬀects, and then focus on the identiﬁed variants to test all pairwise
interactions between them.
Depending on the correlation between the marginal
additive eﬀect size and the probability of being involved in epistasis with SNPs
genome-wide, these ﬁltering methods can be more powerful than the exhaustive
search strategy mentioned in the previous section — not to mention they are certainly
much more computationally eﬃcient. However, for any trait, because there is no
expectation that SNPs involved in epistasis will always have large additive eﬀects,
these ﬁltering methods will not always outperform the exhaustive search method,
and can sometimes be signiﬁcantly under powered (as our simulations and real data
application will show). Here, instead of using the additive test, we propose using
MAPIT as the initial ﬁlter. We hypothesize that the initial list of associated SNPs
from MAPIT will be more robust and more likely capture epistatic eﬀects, as MAPIT
directly prioritizes SNPs based on marginal epistatic eﬀects.
By using marginal
epistatic evidence in the initial ﬁltering step, we expect MAPIT to outperform the
previous common procedure of using a linear model for ﬁltering.
In this set of simulations, we utilize the same subset of real genotypes used for the
marginal epistatic simulations in the last section (The Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium, 2007), and again generate phenotypes under the same four simulation
scenarios with the same two simulation models where pairwise interactions are well
95

deﬁned. After randomly selecting the three sets of causal SNPs and creating their
pairwise interactions, we run MAPIT and a single-SNP additive linear model (via
GEMMA) (Zhou and Stephens, 2012) using all variants. We also reuse the PLINK
exhaustive search, again as a baseline comparison.
For MAPIT and the single-
SNP linear model in GEMMA, we rank each variant according to their marginal
p-values. The top 100 SNPs identiﬁed by both models are then selected, and all
pairwise interactions among them are tested using a linear model that controls for
the two main eﬀects. For the PLINK exhaustive search, we simply rank the top 1002
interactions to assess pairwise power.
Figure 4.4 compares the power of the ﬁltering procedures using the two diﬀerent
methods as an initial step. Phenotypes used to create this ﬁgure were generated
under each scenario with broad-sense heritability H2 “ 0.6. As in previous sections,
all results described in this section are based on model (i) with ρ “ 0.8, and all other
results can be found in Appendix B (see Figures B.14 and B.15). Compared with
the single-SNP test, ﬁltering SNPs using MAPIT provides more power in ﬁnding
true pairwise epistatic interactions. In fact, even for the cases in which the marginal
additive eﬀects contribute to a majority of the broad-sense heritability (i.e. ρ “ 0.8),
using MAPIT as the initial ﬁltration procedure (as opposed to the single-SNP addi-
tive linear model) provides more power for ﬁnding exact causal epistatic pairs. This
improvement comes from the fact that MAPIT allows the ranking of variants to be
based on their marginal epistatic eﬀects, rather than their marginal additive eﬀects.
Therefore, the set of SNPs identiﬁed by MAPIT in the ﬁrst step already contains
variants that capture epistatic eﬀects, thus resulting in higher power in the second
step to identify epistatic interaction pairs. In addition, similar to the simulation
comparison in the previous subsection, MAPIT and the exhaustive search procedure
are advantageous in diﬀerent settings: the exhaustive search procedure is again more
powerful in the sparse setting where each individual pairwise interaction is large
96

(i.e. scenarios I and II) while MAPIT gains an advantage in the polygenic setting
where there a large number of interactions each with small eﬀects (i.e. scenarios III
and IV). Again, in the presence of population stratiﬁcation, MAPIT remains pow-
erful while the exhaustive search procedure suﬀers from substantial power loss (see
Figure B.15). Overall, MAPIT also represents an attractive alternative to identifying
pairwise interactions.
4.3.4
Detecting Epistasis in GEUVADIS Consortium Data
We assess MAPIT’s ability to detect epistasis in a quantitative trait loci (QTL)
association mapping study for gene expression levels (i.e. eQTL study). Often times,
eQTL studies deal with SNP eﬀect sizes (on gene expression levels) that are orders of
magnitude larger than that (on organism-level traits) from GWASs (Pickrell et al.,
2010; Battle et al., 2013; Lappalainen et al., 2013; Tung et al., 2015), thus facilitating
in the identiﬁcation of epistasis. In addition, recent studies have started to reveal
an initial set of epistatic interactions that underlie gene expression variation (Huang
et al., 2013; Becker et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2014). By applying MAPIT to eQTL
studies, we hope to better understand the genetic architecture that underlie gene
expression variation.
The speciﬁc data set that we consider in this section features data from the GEU-
VADIS Consortium (Lappalainen et al., 2013) (http://www.geuvadis.org) which
contains gene expression measurements for 462 individuals from ﬁve diﬀerent popula-
tions: CEPH (CEU), Finns (FIN), British (GBR), Toscani (TSI) and Yoruba (YRI).
Following previous studies (Wen et al., 2015), we focused only on protein coding genes
and lincRNAs that are annotated from GENCODE (release 12) (Harrow et al., 2012).
We removed lowly expressed genes that had zero counts in at least half of the individ-
uals, and obtained a ﬁnal set of 15,607 genes. Afterwards, following previous studies
(Stegle et al., 2010, 2012; ’t Hoen et al., 2013), we performed PEER normalization
97

(Stegle et al., 2010, 2012) to remove confounding eﬀects and unwanted variations. In
order to remove potential population stratiﬁcation, we quantile normalized the gene
expression measurements across individuals in each population to a standard normal
distribution, and then quantile normalized the gene expression measurements to a
standard normal distribution across individuals from all ﬁve populations. In addition
to the gene expression data, all individuals in GEUVADIS also have their genotypes
sequenced in the 1000 Genomes project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2012). Among the sequenced genotypes, we retained 1,236,922 SNPs that have a
minor allele frequency (MAF) above 0.05 and missingness below 0.01. Then, for
each gene in turn, we obtained its cis-SNPs that are located within either 100 kb
upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) or 100 kb downstream of the transcrip-
tion end site (TES) — where such variants represent likely cis-acting QTL, which
are more readily identiﬁable in small sample sizes than trans-QTL (Pickrell et al.,
2010; Battle et al., 2013; Lappalainen et al., 2013; Tung et al., 2015). Overall, we
apply MAPIT to a ﬁnal data set that consists of 2,665,226 SNP-gene pairs with an
average of 175 cis-SNPs per gene.
The results of MAPIT presented in this section are based on using additive and
epistatic relatedness matrices derived from a covariance matrix Kcis, where for the
expression of each gene Kcis was computed using only the corresponding cis-SNPs.
While using Kcis, MAPIT tests the summed epistatic eﬀects between a given cis-SNP
and all other cis-SNPs within the same gene. The primary reason that we present
the main results based on Kcis is to allow for a fair comparison with the exhaustive
search method (details below) — which, due to computational reasons, can only
be applied to examine all cis-pairs. To assess whether or not these initial results
are sensitive to the choice of covariance matrix, we also implement MAPIT using a
genome-wide genetic relatedness matrix KGW, where KGW was computed using all
SNPs in the study (see Appendix B). Using MAPIT with KGW tests the summed
98

epistatic eﬀects between a given cis-SNP and all SNPs genome-wide. Intuitively,
using Kcis will be more powerful than using KGW if epistatic interactions are more
likely to happen between cis-SNP pairs, rather than between cis-SNP and genome-
wide SNP pairs — however, less powerful otherwise. In addition to these two sets
of analyses, we also performed a third analysis to guard against potential residual
population stratiﬁcation. For this analysis, we ﬁrst compute the top 10 principal
components from the genotype matrix. Next, we regress these confounding factors
onto the expression of each gene, and save the residuals — with which we perform
another quantile normalization. Finally, we implement MAPIT on the normalized
residuals using the genome-wide genetic relatedness matrix KGW. The purpose of the
additional analyses is to highlight the robustness of the results found using MAPIT.
To contrast MAPIT’s marginal association ﬁndings, we also implement the single-
SNP additive model via GEMMA on the cis-SNPs as a direct comparison. From this
point forward, we will refer to QTL identiﬁed by MAPIT as marginally epistatic QTL
(mepiQTL), and QTL detected by GEMMA as the more conventional expression
QTL (eQTL). Similarly, we will refer to genes that have at least one mepiQTL as
mepiGenes, and genes that have at least one eQTL as eGenes.
In this analysis, a signiﬁcant marginal association for a particular SNP was deter-
mined by using a Bonferroni-corrected signiﬁcance nominal p-value threshold (P “
1.875 ˆ 10´8). While using the genetic relatedness matrix Kcis, MAPIT identiﬁed a
total of 3,367 mepiQTL across 175 diﬀerent mepiGenes that satisﬁed this signiﬁcance
metric. Additionally, MAPIT identiﬁed a total of 2,158 mepiQTL across 123 diﬀerent
mepiGenes when using KGW, and this number changes to 3,049 mepiQTL across 171
diﬀerent mepiGenes after correcting for residual population stratiﬁcation. GEMMA,
on the other hand, found 55,721 signiﬁcant eQTL across 1,418 diﬀerent eGenes. Note
that the number of eGenes as detected by GEMMA is similar to that from the origi-
nal research (Lappalainen et al., 2013), with slight diﬀerences most likely due to data
99

set variations (e.g. data origins, preprocessing measures, etc.). The histogram of the
MAPIT p-values for all SNP-gene pairs, while using Kcis, is presented in Figure
4.5(a) with a corresponding QQ-plot of the ´log10 p-values presented in Appendix B
(see Figure B.16(a)). Both of these ﬁgures illustrate strong signals on a background
of uniformly distributed p-values. Similar results for MAPIT with KGW, before and
after correction for possible residual population structure and confounding eﬀects,
can be found in Appendix B (see Figures B.16(b), B.16(c), B.17(a) and B.17(c)). In
the Supporting Information of Crawford et al. (2017), we also list the p-values for all
signiﬁcant mepiQTL as computed via a MAPIT scan over the cis-windows of each
gene, with and without correction for population stratiﬁcation (see Tables S4-S6;
http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/06/066985.figures-only).
The
distribution of locations for mepiQTL and eQTL, relative to the gene transcrip-
tion start site (TSS) and the gene transcription end site (TES), is depicted in Figure
4.6 (see also Figure B.18). Consistent with evaluations of other QTL association
mapping studies (Pickrell et al., 2010; Battle et al., 2013; Lappalainen et al., 2013;
Tung et al., 2015), eQTLs detected by GEMMA are mostly enriched near TSS. In
contrast, mepiQTLs are enriched near the TES in addition to the TSS, with distance
to genes showing a slightly wider spread pattern than eQTLs.
Since MAPIT produces a single p-value for each tested variant, we may visualize
the speciﬁc genomic locations that exhibit epistasis. Figure 4.7 displays zoomed-in
manhattan plots for three of the twenty-two chromosomes where some of the most
notable signiﬁcant marginal epistatic eﬀects were detected. Figures depicting the
genome-wide epistatic scans of the other chromosomes can be found in Appendix B
(see Figure B.19). Note that since there could be multiple p-values for a single SNP
(i.e. its association evidence for multiple genes), we choose to display the minimum
p-value as the summary statistic for any given SNP. We stress that the interpretation
of these images is slightly diﬀerent than what is used for traditional manhattan plots.
100

Speciﬁcally, in these ﬁgures, spikes across chromosomes suggest loci where members
involved in epistatic interactions can be found.
In order to search for exact epistatic pairs, we took all signiﬁcant mepiQTL
and eQTL, and analyzed the pairwise interactions between them. This compari-
son allows us to assess the power of MAPIT and GEMMA as ﬁltering approaches
within the context of real data. Similar to what was done in the simulation stud-
ies, both ﬁltering procedures were carried out by ﬁrst ranking SNPs by either their
mepiQTL or eQTL p-values, and then searching for associated epistatic pair be-
tween the top v SNPs.
Interactions between two mepiQTL or eQTL were then
called signiﬁcant if they had a joint p-value below a Bonferroni corrected threshold
(i.e. P “ 0.05{pvpv´1q{2q). Once again, we applied the fully exhaustive search model
in PLINK as a baseline power comparison, in which we examined all of the cis-SNP
pairs for each gene. Note that for PLINK we only consider SNP-gene pairs as it
was not computationally feasible to perform an absolute complete exhaustive search
(i.e. every gene pair between all 1.2 million SNPs for each of the 16,000 genes). Figure
4.5(b) (and Figures B.17(b) and B.17(d)) depicts the number of signiﬁcant pairwise
interactions identiﬁed by MAPIT and GEMMA when searching between the top
v “ t50, 100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500u marginally associated variants. Altogether,
the exhaustive search method in PLINK identiﬁed 3,335 signiﬁcant epistatic pairs
before the correction of residual confounding eﬀects, and 3,906 signiﬁcant pairwise
interactions after the correction. These benchmarks are represented by the dotted
lines in Figure 4.5(b), B.17(b), and B.17(d), respectively. As demonstrated in the
numerical experiments, using MAPIT as the initial ﬁltration procedure (as opposed
to the single-SNP additive model) eﬃciently provides more power to ﬁnding signif-
icant epistatic pairs. Moreover, considering interactions amongst just the top 2,500
mepiQTL (in any of the considered settings for MAPIT) almost results in the same
total number of signiﬁcant epistatic pairs that is to be discovered by the fully ex-
101

haustive search model from PLINK. As previously shown, these results may be due
to MAPIT’s ability to marginally detect the “hub” SNPs of interactions. For exam-
ple, under the expression for gene C16orf88, the SNP rs11645910 (MAPIT P « 0)
is a member of many of the top signiﬁcant epistatic pairs. We also note that 35 of
the 175 epistatic associated genes identiﬁed by MAPIT with Kcis have been veriﬁed
in previous analyses on a diﬀerent data set (Brown et al., 2014). Similarly, 30 of
the 123 mepiGenes discovered by MAPIT with KGW, and 34 of the 171 mepiGenes
discovered by MAPIT with KGW after correction for residual confounders, have been
veriﬁed in the same works.
In order to better explain why MAPIT was able to identify signiﬁcant epistatic
pairs in this study, we refer back to the variance component modeling approach (Hen-
derson, 1985; R¨onneg˚ard et al., 2008; Jiang and Reif, 2015) we used in simulations to
evaluate the overall contribution of pairwise epistasis to the PVE for the expression
of each gene (details in Section 4.2.3). Again, the basic idea behind dissecting the
makeup of the PVE is using a linear mixed model with multiple variance compo-
nents to partition the phenotypic variance into two distinct components: a linear
component and a pairwise interaction component. Disregarding any random noise,
we quantify the contribution of the two components by examining the proportion
of PVE (pPVE) explained by that component. In Supporting information, we il-
lustrate the estimates of the pPVE decomposition by additive eﬀects and pairwise
epistasis for all genes (see Figure B.20). In this particular data set, we ﬁnd that the
mean pPVE for the pairwise interaction component is approximately 10%, which
is consistent with previous studies on the same data (Gamazon et al., 2015); while
the additive eﬀects only explain about 3.5% on average. To put this into better
context, for the gene C16orf88, pairwise epistatic eﬀects are estimated to explain
approximately 5% of the PVE, while additive eﬀects are estimated to only account
for 3 ˆ 10´3%. In fact, the pairwise order component actually explains a larger pro-
102

portion of phenotypic variance than the linear component in the expression of 7,704
out of 15,607 genes.
Finally, we also want to point out one important caveat for mapping epistasis in
real data: in the analyses of genetic mapping studies, apparent epistasis inferred by
any epistatic mapping methods can sometimes be explained by same-locus additive
eﬀects (Wood et al., 2014). This means that the results from MAPIT (or the ex-
haustive search procedure or the additive-eﬀect based ﬁltering procedure) could be
confounded by additive eﬀects of untyped SNPs or uncontrolled SNPs in the same
region. Dealing with these contingencies is diﬃcult because it is impossible to pre-
cisely control for the additive ﬁxed eﬀects of all SNPs that reside in the same locus.
Therefore, we caution against the over-interpretation of our results and simply use
the GEUVADIS data as an illustration on how MAPIT can be used as a ﬁrst step
towards understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypic variation.
4.4
Discussion
We have presented MAPIT, a novel method and strategy for detecting variants that
are involved in epistasis in genetic mapping studies. For each variant in turn, MAPIT
estimates and tests its marginal epistatic eﬀect — the combined epistatic eﬀect
between the examined variant and all other variants. By modeling and inferring
the marginal epistatic eﬀects, MAPIT can identify variants that exhibit non-zero
epistatic interactions with any other variant without the need to identify the speciﬁc
marker combinations that drive the epistatic association. Therefore, MAPIT rep-
resents an attractive alternative to standard methods (Hemani et al., 2011; Lippert
et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010a; Wan et al., 2010) for mapping epistasis. With both
simulations and real data applications, we have illustrated the beneﬁts of MAPIT.
In the present study, we have focused on estimating and testing marginal epistatic
eﬀects in the presence of pairwise interactions with MAPIT. MAPIT can also be eas-
103

ily extended to detect variants that are involved in higher-order interactions. Specif-
ically, in the presence of higher-order interactions, we can introduce extra random
eﬀects terms to represent the combined higher-order interaction eﬀects between the
examined variant and all other variants — this would simply mean adding an extra
random eﬀects term for each extra higher-order of interactions. Under the normality
assumption of the interaction eﬀect sizes, the introduced random eﬀects terms would
all follow multivariate normal distributions, with the covariance matrices determined
as a function of the Hadamard product of the additive genetic relatedness matrix
(Jiang and Reif, 2015; R¨onneg˚ard et al., 2008; Young and Durbin, 2014). Therefore,
we can use a multiple variance component model with additional variance compo-
nents to map epistatic variants in the presence of higher-order interactions. From
there, we can test the variance components jointly to identify variants that are in-
volved in any order of epistatic interactions. We can test each variance component
separately to identify variants that are involved in a particular order epistatic inter-
action. Or, better still, we can perform variable selection on the variance components
to identify which higher order interaction a particular variant of interest is involved
in. Extending MAPIT to mapping high-order interactions will likely provide further
insights into the epistatic genetic architecture of various traits and diseases.
We have focused on mapping epistasis for quantitative traits. For case-control
studies, one may be tempted to follow previous approximate approaches of treating
binary phenotypes as continuous traits and apply MAPIT directly (Lee et al., 2011;
Zhou et al., 2013; Moser et al., 2015). However, it would be desirable to extend
MAPIT to accommodate case-control data or other discrete data types in a principled
way. Two variance component models are available for handling case-control data,
and each has its advantages and drawbacks. The ﬁrst model is the liability threshold
model, which models the liability score underlying the binary trait with a variance
component model (Lee et al., 2011; Golan et al., 2014). The liability threshold model
104

has been widely used for estimating heritability of common diseases, but relies on
an asymptotically normal test, which, as is evident with our simulations, may fail to
properly control for type I error at the genome-wide signiﬁcance level for association
tests. The second model is the logistic mixed model that has been well established in
the statistics literature (Breslow and Clayton, 1993; Breslow and Lin, 1995; Lin and
Breslow, 1996; Lin, 1997), and has been recently applied to perform association tests
in case-control studies (Chen et al., 2016). However, unlike the liability threshold
model, it is not straightforward to deﬁne and partition the phenotypic variance into
various genetic components under the logistic mixed model. Therefore, future studies
are needed to extend MAPIT to case-control studies by either unifying the two models
or developing new methods that can perform rigorous hypothesis tests while enabling
genetic partitioning of phenotypic variance.
In its current form, we have focused on demonstrating MAPIT with a variance
component model. The variance component model in MAPIT eﬀectively assumes
that the interaction eﬀect between the examined variant and every other variant
follows a normal distribution. This normality assumption and the resulting variance
component model have been widely used in many areas of genetics. For example,
variance component models are used in rare variant tests to combine the additive
eﬀects of multiple rare variants to improve association mapping power (Wu et al.,
2011; Lee et al., 2012; Broadaway et al., 2016; Ionita-Laza et al., 2013; Lee et al.,
2014). Similarly, variance component models are used to jointly model all genome-
wide SNPs at once for estimating SNP heritability (Yang et al., 2010; Zhou et al.,
2013). Studies have already shown that variance component models produce unbi-
ased estimates regardless of whether or not the underlying eﬀect sizes follow a normal
distribution, and are reasonably robust even when the model is severely misspeci-
ﬁed (Yang et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2013). However, like any statistical model, the
inference results of variance component models can be aﬀected when the modeling
105

assumptions are not fully satisﬁed. For example, recent studies have shown that
the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern of causal SNPs can cause estimation bias
that is either minor allele frequency (MAF) mediated or non-MAF-mediated (Speed
et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015). Such LD-biases likely aﬀect MAPIT in a similar
fashion. Therefore, adapting the approaches taken in Speed et al. (2012); Yang et al.
(2015) or developing a more realistic modeling assumption will likely improve the
robustness of MAPIT even further. Fortunately, MAPIT can easily be extended to
incorporate other eﬀect size assumptions. Indeed, the main idea in MAPIT of map-
ping marginal epistatic eﬀects is not restricted to the particular variance component
model we examine here, nor is it restricted to the normality assumption of the inter-
action eﬀect sizes. Therefore, we can incorporate sparsity-inducing priors for eﬀect
sizes if the number of interaction pairs is known to be small a priori. Alternatively,
we can use the recently developed hybrid eﬀect size prior that has been shown to
work well under a variety of eﬀect size distributions (Zhou et al., 2013). Diﬀerent
interaction eﬀect size assumptions can be advantageous under diﬀerent genetic archi-
tectures and incorporating them in diﬀerent scenarios will likely improve the power
of MAPIT further.
We have only compared MAPIT with two commonly used epistatic mapping
methods that include an exhaustive search method and an additive eﬀect priori-
tization method. There are many other novel methods that have been developed
recently (Zhang and Liu, 2007; Zhang et al., 2011a; Zhang, 2012; Zhang et al., 2014;
Tang et al., 2009; Prabhu and Pe’er, 2012; Ma et al., 2013). For example, a recently
proposed partition retention method partitions individuals into diﬀerent genotype
groups that are deﬁned based on the pairwise or high-order combinations of their
genotypes (e.g. a total of 81 genotype groups for four SNPs that each have three
genotype classes) (Chernoﬀet al., 2009). More speciﬁcally, this method ﬁrst com-
putes the phenotypic variance across these genotype groups, and then examines each
106

SNP in the combination by testing whether the SNP adds a signiﬁcant contribution
to the phenotypic variance across the groups. Despite its computational intensity,
the partition retention method produces promising results. It would thus be impor-
tant to compare MAPIT with the partition retention method, as well as others, in
the future.
There are many other potential extensions of MAPIT. We have only focused on
analyzing one phenotype at a time in this study. However, it has been extensively
shown that modeling multiple phenotypes can often dramatically increase power
(Zhou and Stephens, 2014; Korte et al., 2012). Therefore, it would be interesting to
extend MAPIT to take advantage of phenotype correlations to identify pleiotropic
epistatic eﬀects. Modeling epistasis in the context of multiple phenotypes could be
highly non-trivial, as we need to properly model the shared epistatic components
between phenotypes, in addition to the shared additive eﬀects between phenotypes.
Modeling strategies based on the multivariate linear mixed model (mvLMM) (Zhou
and Stephens, 2014; Korte et al., 2012) could be helpful here.
MAPIT is not without its limitations. Perhaps the most noticeable limitation
is that MAPIT cannot be used to directly identify the interaction pairs that drive
individual variant association. In particular, after identifying a variant involved in
epistasis, it is still unclear which variants it interacts with. Thus, despite being able
to identify SNPs that are involved in epistasis, MAPIT is unable to directly identify
detailed interaction pairs. However, we argue that being able to identify variants
that are involved in epistasis is often an important ﬁrst step towards identifying
and understanding detailed epistatic associations. In addition, being able to identify
SNPs involved in epistasis allows us to come up with an initial likely set of variants
that are worth further exploration. Indeed, we advertise a two-step ad hoc epistasis
association mapping procedure. First, we identify individual SNP associations with
MAPIT. Then, we focus on the most signiﬁcant associations from the ﬁrst step to
107

further test all of the pairwise interactions among them in order to identify speciﬁc
epistatic interactions. Unlike the previous ﬁltering strategies that are commonly used
in epistatic mapping, our two-step procedure is unique in the sense that the SNP
set identiﬁed in our ﬁrst step contains SNPs that already display strong epistatic ef-
fects with other variants. Therefore, our two-step procedure outperforms alternative
ﬁltering strategies in simulations and real data applications. Nonetheless, we cau-
tion that the two-step procedure is still ad hoc in nature and could miss important
epistatic associations. Therefore, exploring statistical approaches that can unify the
two steps would be an interesting area for future research. Besides this main limita-
tion, we also note that MAPIT can be computationally expensive. MAPIT requires
ﬁtting a variance component model for every SNP in turn, and ﬁtting variance com-
ponent models are known to be computationally challenging (Zhou and Stephens,
2012, 2014). In this study, we use the recently developed MQS method for variance
component estimation and testing. Compared with the standard REML method,
MQS is computationally eﬃcient, allows for exact p-value computation based on the
Davies method, and is statistically more eﬃcient than the REML estimates when
the variance component is small (Zhou, 2016) — a property that is particularly rel-
evant here considering the marginal epistatic eﬀect size is often small. MQS allows
us to apply MAPIT to moderately sized genetic mapping studies with thousands
of samples and millions of variants, which is otherwise impossible using any other
variance component estimation methods. Still, new algorithms are likely needed to
scale MAPIT up to datasets that orders of magnitude larger in size.

Preliminary Results for Future Work: Integrating
Genomic Imaging with Variance Component
Models
5.1
Introduction
Radiogenomics, or imaging genomics, focuses on understanding the relationship be-
tween clinical imaging and functional genomic variation.
In cancer applications,
radiogenomic analyses often involve integrating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data, gene expression data, and gene mutation status in order to make more in-
formed clinical decisions or to better understand the etiology of a particular disease.
This chapter makes two contributions to the ﬁeld of radiogenomics (Crawford et al.,
2016b). The ﬁrst contribution is the development of a novel statistic, the smooth Eu-
ler characteristic transform (SECT), which is designed to integrate shape information
into standard statistical models. The second contribution is a detailed radiogenomic
analysis of glioblastoma multiforme with the objective of predicting clinical outcomes
using imaging and gene expression data.
Gliomas are a collection of tumors arising from glia or their precursors within
116

the central nervous system. Of all gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the
most aggressive and most common in humans (Holland, 2000). The prognosis for
patients with GBM is poor with typical post-diagnosis survival of 12-15 months and
the probability of 5 year survival is less than 10% (Patel et al., 2014). In addition,
obtaining molecular assays of a tumor from patients with GBM often requires invasive
surgical procedures such as stereotactic biopsy or craniotomy. Imaging technologies
provide a useful alternative to standard genomic biomarkers, and can help with both
the earlier detection and monitoring of tumors.
Imaging technologies have recently been used in cancer research to correlate fea-
tures from images to clinical outcomes (e.g. survival) and molecular biomarkers. One
noteworthy eﬀort where imaging and genomic data have been collected is the Reposi-
tory of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) (Clark et al., 2013). Based
on the REMBRANDT data, a set of MRI features have been derived in the Visually
Accessible Rembrandt Images (VASARI) project. Using the VASARI image features,
Gutman et al. (2013) and Mazurowski et al. (2013) were able to show that the inclu-
sion of geometric information can improve predictions of survival outcomes. Gevaert
et al. (2014) and Macyszyn et al. (2016) expanded on this work by showing that
geometric features can also be used to predict speciﬁc GBM subtypes. Generating
the VASARI features involved annotation by neuro-radiologists which is costly and
has since motivated the development of fully automated pipelines for GBM image
analysis to link the geometry of tumors to patient prognostics (Mazurowski et al.,
2014; Rios Velazquez et al., 2015). In Itakura et al. (2015), cancer subtypes deﬁned
by imaging features were found to correlate with both survival and the activation
of molecular signaling pathways. Typically, the geometric features extracted from
images in radiogenomic applications have been limited to gross spatial features such
as the presence of multifocal tumors (Liu et al., 2015) or the location of recurrent
lesions (Kim et al., 2015).
117

In this chapter, we alternatively explore the use of the SECT as an automated
procedure to extract geometric or topological statistics from tumor images.
The
argument for using the SECT for radiogenomics is that more precise geometric in-
formation is captured in robust ways when using topological summaries of a shape.
The SECT is a variation of the persistent homology transform (PHT), which was ini-
tially introduced by Turner et al. (2014b) to represent shapes and measure distances
between CT scans of primate bones as an application in geometric morphometrics.
The advantage of the SECT over the PHT is that the statistical summary computed
by the SECT is a collection of smooth vectors, while the summary generated by the
PHT is a collection of persistent homology diagrams (Edelsbrunner et al., 2000) and
thus has a complicated representation and geometry (Turner et al., 2014a). There-
fore, unlike the SECT, the PHT is diﬃcult to incorporate into standard statistical
models such as variance component models. In this work, we examine in detail how
SECT features applied to tumor images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
compare to gene expression data, as well as classical volumetric and morphomet-
ric features, in predicting two clinical outcomes: disease free survival (DFS) and
overall survival (OS). We show that the SECT features outperform gene expression,
volumetric features, and morphometric features in predicting DFS.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 5.2, we describe
the SECT in detail and provide a brief description of topological data analysis (TDA).
In Section 5.3, we specify a Bayesian framework that allows us to integrate SECT
features with other covariates in an eﬃcient and robust linear mixed model, which
we denote as the mixed genomic best linear unbiased prediction (MG-BLUP) model.
In Section 5.4, we use the MG-BLUP to compare the utility of the SECT summaries,
gene expression data, volumetric features, and morphometric features in predicting
survival of patients with GBM. Lastly, we close the chapter with a discussion of future
directions, limitations of our proposed approach, and some immediate challenges in
118

radiogenomics.
5.2
Quantifying Tumor Images Using Topological Summaries
In this section, we provide an overview of existing statistical methods for summarizing
shapes, and deﬁne the smooth Euler characteristic transform (SECT) — a summary
statistic that captures the geometry and topology of a shape. We also outline why
this statistic is well-suited to integrate shape information into standard statistical
models.
5.2.1
Integral Geometry and Shape Statistics
Classical shape statistics represented three-dimensional shapes as landmark points
placed on the shape (Kendall, 1984; Bookstein, 1997; Dryden and Mardia, 1998).
This representation was partly due to the limited imaging and processing technology
of the time. Raw data themselves were typically collected only as points, or distances
between points; and moreover, statistical and computational methodology to be able
to model shapes as three-dimensional images simply did not exist. At present, current
imaging technologies allow three-dimensional shapes to be represented as meshes —
a collection of vertices, faces, and edges. An example of a mesh is depicted in Figure
5.1(a).
Given the advancement in both imaging technology and computational tools to
process the imaging data, classical landmark-based approaches that previously re-
quired user-speciﬁcation of landmarks have become less relevant.
Methods have
since been developed that generate automated geometric morphometrics, bypassing
the need for user-speciﬁed landmarks for mesh representations (Boyer et al., 2011; Al-
Aifari et al., 2013; Lipman and Daubechies, 2011; Boyer et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016;
Gao et al., 2016). Figure 5.1(b) illustrates a landmark representation of a molar, to
illustrate and compare the diﬀerence between mesh and landmark representations of
119

shapes. Note that both user-speciﬁed and automated landmark-based methods for
geometric morphometrics are known to suﬀer from structural errors when comparing
shapes that are highly dissimilar (Gao et al., 2016; Gao, 2015).
An approach that comprehensively addresses these issues by bypassing both user
and automated speciﬁcation of landmarks, as well as highly dissimilar and non-
isomorphic shapes, was developed in Turner et al. (2014b) where a statistical sum-
mary of the data known as the persistent homology transform (PHT) was used to
represent shape. The PHT is a collection of persistence diagrams — multiscale topo-
logical summaries used extensively in topological data analysis (TDA).
5.2.2
Topological Data Analysis: Geometric and Topological Preliminaries
The mesh representation of a shape is an example of a mathematical object known as
a simplicial complex, which are important objects of study in TDA. TDA provides
a rich array of powerful tools and methodologies built upon a solid foundation of
classic mathematical and statistical theory that successfully recovers information
and structure of an underlying data space.
A k-simplex is the convex hull of k ` 1 aﬃne independent points v0, v1, . . . vk,
and is denoted by σ “ rv0, v1, . . . , vks. Examples of k-simplices are points, lines,
and triangles. The 0-simplex rv0s is the vertex v0, the 1-simplex rv0, v1s is the edge
between the vertices v0 and v1, and the 2-simplex rv0, v1, v2s is the triangle bordered
by the edges rv0, v1s, rv1, v2s, and rv0, v2s.
Deﬁnition 5.2.1. A simplicial complex K is a countable set of simplices such that:
1. Every face of a simplex in K is also in K;
2. If two k-simplices σ1, σ2 are in K, then their intersection is either empty or a
face of both σ1 and σ2.
120

Homology and Persistence.
The PHT statistic was proposed by Turner et al. (2014b)
as a way of representing shapes, and relies on persistent homology for its calculation.
Persistent homology is a mathematical concept of fundamental interest in applied
topology, and especially in TDA. In particular, persistent homology is a multi-scale
instantiation of the classical concept of homology which we now describe informally.
For a more rigorous treatment, see Hatcher (2002) and Munkres (1984).
Given a shape M with a ﬁnite simplicial complex representation (mesh) K, a
simplicial k-chain is a formal linear combination (over Z2 in this chapter) of k-
simplices in K. The set of k-chains forms a vector space CkpKq. The boundary map
is Bk : CkpKq Ñ Ck´1pKq, given by
Bk prv0, v1, . . . , vksq “
kÿ
j“0
rv0, . . . , v´j, . . . , vks
with linear extension, where v´j denotes that we drop element j.
Elements of
BkpKq “ im Bk`1 are called boundaries, and elements of ZkpKq “ ker Bk are called
cycles.
Deﬁnition 5.2.2. The kth homology group of M is deﬁned by the quotient group
HkpKq “ ZkpKq{BkpKq.
The intuition behind a homology group is that it contains information about
the structure of K. The zeroth homology group H0pXq is generated by elements
that represent connected components of X. For example, if X has three connected
components, then H0pXq – Z2 ‘ Z2 ‘ Z2, where – denotes group isomorphism.
For k ě 1, the k-th homology group HkpXq is generated by elements representing
k-dimensional “holes” or “loops” in X.
A k-dimensional hole can be thought of
as the result of taking the boundary of a pk ` 1q-dimensional body. The ranks of
the homology groups (i.e. the number of generators) are called the Betti numbers,
121

and are denoted by βkpXq “ rank
`
HkpXq
˘
. The notation H˚pXq refers to all the
homology groups simultaneously. In Figure 5.2, we display the homology of a torus
constructed from a simplicial complex.
A ﬁltration K of simpicial complexes is a family of spaces K “ tKtub
t“a such that
Kt1 Ď Kt2 if t1 ă t2. As the parameter t increases, the homology of the spaces Kt
may change (e.g. components are added and merged, cycles are formed and ﬁlled
up). The persistent homology of K is denoted by PH˚pKq and keeps track of the
progression of homology groups generated by the ﬁltration. More speciﬁcally, the
persistent homology contains the information about the homology of the individual
spaces tKtu, as well as the mappings between the homology of Kt1 and Kt2 for every
t1 ă t2. Note that persistent homology is also equivalently referred to as persistence.
The above description of persistent homology is based on simplicial complexes,
which are the object of our particular interest since mesh representations of shapes
are simplicial complexes. However, we note that persistent homology is a notion that
also lends itself to other structures and modes of learning an underlying space from
which data is sampled. Another example is the union of balls around the sampled
points. We can study the persistence on either of these two structures, since the Nerve
Lemma — a powerful result due to Borsuk (1948) — provides homotopy equivalence
between simplicial complexes and unions of balls.
Intuitively, the main idea behind persistent homology is to study homology across
multiple scales. Rather than restricting ourselves to only one instance of a space, in
persistent homology we study the evolution of the topological structure over a ﬁltra-
tion of the space, which amounts to beginning with a rigid proximity rule connecting
observed data points, and then continuously relaxing this rule — all while studying
the corresponding topological progression. Figure 5.3(a) illustrates ﬁve instances of
this idea, where the underlying space is an annulus from which points are sampled.
Balls are formed around these data points, with radii growing from r1 through to r5.
122

We see the homology being captured changes with radius size, which in this case is
the proximity rule.
Barcodes and Persistence Diagrams.
The persistence of the data is encoded in objects
that are parameterizations of these homology groups known as barcodes: collections of
intervals which correspond to the lifetimes of topological features. The left endpoint
of a bar is the birth time of an element in PH˚pKq and can be thought of as the value
of t where this element appears for the ﬁrst time. Conversely, the right endpoint of
a bar is the death time and represents the value of t where an element vanishes, or
merges with another existing element.
Figure 5.3 provides an example of a barcode and illustrates the idea behind
persistent homology. First, n “ 50 samples P1, . . . , Pn P R2 were sampled from a
uniform distribution on an annulus, and Xr “ Ť
i BrpPiq is deﬁned to be the union
of closed balls around the samples. Increasing r causes Xr to grow. As this happens,
connected components merge, cycles are formed and then are ﬁlled up. The barcode
in Figure 5.3(b) captures a summary of all the homology features in this process.
Speciﬁcally, in this image there are two bars that are signiﬁcantly longer than the
others (one in H0 and one in H1), indicating that the underlying space has a single
connected component and a single cycle, similar to that of the annulus.
Barcodes can therefore be considered as summary statistics of the data generating
process, as they suﬃciently allow for a reduction in dimension of the ambient space.
This information can alternatively be represented by a persistence diagram, which
takes the birth and death times of each bar in a barcode as an ordered pair px, yq
and produces a scatterplot, thus providing a multi-scale topological summary of the
data space. In a persistence diagram, the points lie in R2 and all the points on
the diagonal x “ y have inﬁnite multiplicity. The diagonal is included for technical
reasons and involves deﬁning a metric on the space of diagrams or barcodes. Points
123

on the diagonal may be intuitively thought of as topological noise, since they are
points that are born and die immediately.
Since summary statistics are direct parallels to the invariants of a topological
space, considering such topological approaches in data analytics is a way of reducing
dimensionality in high-dimensional statistical problems (i.e. where the number of co-
variates is far greater than the number of observations). For a complete discussion on
frequently used methodologies in TDA and applied topology, we refer the interested
reader to the following works: Carlsson (2009), Carlsson (2014), Edelsbrunner et al.
(2000), Ghrist (2008).
5.2.3
Topological Shape Measures
The SECT is a variation of the PHT due to Turner et al. (2014b) and Turner et al.
(2014b). In this subsection, we will introduce and deﬁne the SECT, state some of
its properties, and motivate why we propose the SECT be used over the PHT.
The Persistent Homology Transform.
Let M be a closed, compact subset (shape) of
Rd that can be written as a ﬁnite simplicial complex K. For any unit vector over
the unit sphere ν P Sd´1, we deﬁne a ﬁltration Kpνq of K parameterized by a height
r as
Kpνqr “ tx P K : x ¨ ν ď ru
(5.1)
for a unit vector ν P Sd´1. The parameter height function rνpxq is then deﬁned as
r : R2 Ñ R
tx, νu ÞÑ x ¨ ν
(5.2)
for the same ﬁxed unit ν P Sd´1. See Figure 5.4 for an example of ﬁltration by
a height function. The k-th dimensional persistence diagram XkpK, νq summarizes
124

how the topology of the ﬁltration Kpνq changes over the height parameter r, as
described in the previous subsection.
Deﬁnition 5.2.3 (Turner et al. (2014b)). The persistent homology transform (PHT)
of K Ă Rd is the function
PHTpKq : Sd´1 Ñ Dd
ν ÞÑ
`
X0pK, νq, X1pK, νq, . . . , Xd´1pK, νq
˘
.
The PHT measures the change in homology by the height ﬁltration over all di-
rections on the unit sphere.
There are two reasons why the PHT is useful.
To
illustrate the ﬁrst, denote the space of persistence diagrams as D (Mileyko et al.,
2011; Turner et al., 2014a; Bubenik, 2015), and given two diagrams X, Y P D, note
that the Wasserstein distance between the diagrams X and Y is given by
distpX, Y q “
inf
ϕ:XÑY
ÿ
xPX
}x ´ ϕpxq},
where ϕ is a bijection between points in X and Y . Let Md be the space of subsets
of Rd that can be represented as ﬁnite simplicial complexes. The PHT can be used
to deﬁne a distance metric between shapes or surfaces
distPHT
Md pK1, K2q “
dÿ
k“0
ż
Sd´1 dist pXkpK1, νq, XkpK2, νqq dν,
which allows for comparisons and similarity studies between shapes. Secondly, the
PHT preserves information, and a notion of statistical suﬃciency was proven for
the PHT. Speciﬁcally, it was proven in Turner et al. (2014b) that the PHT is in-
jective when the domain is Md for d “ 2, 3. In practice, the PHT is not computed
using all directions on the sphere. A corresponding proof of stability of the PHT
justiﬁes the use of ﬁnitely many directions, and gives a corresponding bound on the
approximation error.
125

While the PHT was useful in computing distances between shapes, it is challeng-
ing to use in standard likelihood based models. Most widely used likelihood models
have an inner product structure between the model parameters and suﬃcient statis-
tics. The PHT does not admit a simple inner product structure as it is a collection of
persistence diagrams, and the geometry of the space of persistence diagrams is known
to be an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded from below (Burago et al., 1992).
This space does not have unique geodesics and objects like the Fr´echet mean are not
unique (Turner et al., 2014a). The geometry and complicated structure of the persis-
tence diagrams are an impediment to using the PHT in standard regression models,
such as variance component models.
Our motivation for deﬁning the SECT is that it contains the same information
as the PHT but is a continuous, piecewise linear function and is an element in the
Hilbert space L2pRq.
The Smooth Euler Characteristic Transform.
The SECT is based on the Euler charac-
teristic (EC), a common yet important topological invariant that comes up in many
branches of mathematics. Classically, it is known to be of importance in polyhedral
combinatorics and algebraic topology, and therefore in TDA.
Deﬁnition 5.2.4. The Euler characteristic (EC) χ for a ﬁnite simplicial complex
Kd for d “ 3 is deﬁned by:
χpK3q “ V ´ E ` F,
(5.3)
where V , E, and F are the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively.
Important probabilistic results based on the EC in the context of Gaussian ran-
dom ﬁelds have also been established (Adler, 2010; Taylor and Adler, 2003; Adler
and Taylor, 2007), and used in applications (Adler et al., 2014). In homology and
persistent homology, the EC counts the Betti numbers βk in an alternating sum.
126

The EC curve is constructed by tracking the progression of the EC as a function
with respect to a ﬁltration K. In the context of closed, compact subsets (shapes)
M Ă R3 represented by ﬁnite simplicial complexes K, we consider the ﬁltration
(i.e. Equation (5.1)) via the height function (i.e. Equation (5.2)) and denote the
extremal heights from this ﬁltration in the direction ν P S2 by
aν “ mintrνpxq, x P Ku,
bν “ maxtrνpxq, x P Ku.
Deﬁnition 5.2.5. Let Kx
ν denote the simplicial complex that represents the closed,
compact subset M x
ν Ď M Ă R3 generated by the sublevel set ﬁltration (Equation
(5.1)), deﬁned by the height function rνpxq (Equation (5.2)) for varying x, for a
ﬁxed unit direction vector ν P S2. The EC curve is deﬁned by
χK
ν : raν, bνs Ñ Z Ă R
x ÞÑ χ
`
Kx
ν
˘
.
(5.4)
The EC curve tracks the evolution of the EC up to (and including) the largest sub-
complex of M contained in the sublevel set r´1
ν
`
p´8, xs
˘
.
See Figure 5.5 for an
illustration of the EC curve. In considering a directional sweep over the surface of
the sphere S2, and calculating the corresponding EC curves of the ﬁnite simplicial
complex representations of M for every direction ν P S2, the Euler characteristic
transform (ECT) (Turner et al., 2014b) is deﬁned as follows:
ECTpMq : Sd´1 Ñ ZR
ν ÞÑ χ
`
Mpx, νq
˘
.
(5.5)
Notice that the EC curve in Equation (5.4) and its corresponding ECT in Equa-
tion (5.5) are piecewise constant, integer-valued functions. The numerous disconti-
nuities will aﬀect the stability of this representation — this is visually illustrated in
127

Figure 5.5(c). We therefore propose a reformulation of the ECT to allow for com-
putational tractability and statistical analyses, by smoothing the function via the
following procedure. First, take the mean value of the EC curve ¯χK
ν over raν, bνs,
and then subtract it from the value of the EC curve χK
ν pxq at every x P raν, bνs. The
result is a centered EC curve in the direction ν P S2,
ZK
ν : raν, bνs Ñ R
x ÞÑ χK
ν pxq ´ ¯χK
ν .
(5.6)
Here, we denote the value of ZK
ν
to be zero outside the interval raν, bνs. Through
the cumulation of these results, we obtain the following construct:
Deﬁnition 5.2.6. The centered, cumulative Euler characteristic curve, or smoothed
Euler characteristic curve (SEC), for a ﬁxed direction ν P Sd´1, is deﬁned for all
y P R as
SECpMq : R Ñ L2
F K
ν pyq “
ż y
´8
ZK
ν pxqdx.
(5.7)
The SEC is a continuous, piecewise linear function with compact support raν, bνs,
by construction. It is therefore an element of the Hilbert space L2 of square inte-
grable functions on R. The counterpart to Figure 5.5(c), smoothed by the procedure
resulting in the SEC, is visually illustrated in Figure 5.5(d).
We now formally deﬁne the smooth Euler characteristic transform.
Deﬁnition 5.2.7. The smooth Euler characteristic transform (SECT) for a simpli-
cial complex K of a shape M is the map
SECT : tK, Sd´1u Ñ L2raν, bνs
ν ÞÑ F K
ν pbνq
(5.8)
128

for all ν P Sd´1. Each curve F K
ν
is also an element in the Hilbert space L2. The
following metric can therefore be used to deﬁne distances between two meshes K1 and
K2:
distSECT
Md pK1, K2q “
„ż
Sd´1 }F K1
ν
´ F K2
ν }2dν
1{2
.
(5.9)
The advantage of the SECT over the PHT is that the SECT summaries are a col-
lection of curves and has a Hilbert space structure, which means that their structure
allows for quantitative comparisons using the full scope of statistical methdology.
The SECT is also an injective map and the following corollary follows immediately
from Theorem 3.1 in Turner et al. (2014b).
Corollary 2. The smooth Euler characteristic transform is injective when the do-
main is Md for d “ 2, 3.
It is important to note here that enough directions ν P Sd´1 must be taken for
this corollary to hold, since for any one ﬁxed direction, it is not true that the EC
curve (upon which the SECT construction depends) is injective. An illustration of
this fact is depicted in Figure 5.6. To determine the number of directions to use for
our application to GBM data, we performed a sensitivity analysis of many diﬀerent
combinations of numbers of directions and sublevel sets, and found our prediction
results to be reasonably robust to our ﬁnal choice of numerical parameters, given in
Section 5.4.
5.3
Variance Component Models to Predict Clinical Outcomes
In this section, we specify a class of variance component models used to predict
clinical outcomes based on a collection of mRNA gene expression measurements and
morphometric, volumetric, and topological features based features of MRI scans. The
model detailed here is similar to previous Bayesian linear mixed models (LMMs) used
129

in genomic studies (Ishwaran and Rao, 2005; Guan and Stephens, 2011; Zhou et al.,
2013), and incorporates theory from the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)
model (Henderson, 1985). For more relevant background, see George and McCulloch
(1993b), Brown et al. (1998), and Barbieri and Berger (2004). The main advantage
of the Bayesian framework is that it takes into account of uncertainty in parameter
estimates when making predictive inferences.
5.3.1
Bayesian Mixed Genomic BLUP
We now provide the Bayesian mixed genomic BLUP (MG-BLUP) in which variance
components are used to model the random eﬀects of gene expression and tumor
morphometrics, volumetrics, and topology
y “ g ` s ` m ` v ` ε,
ε „ MVNp0, τ ´1Iq,
(5.10)
where each component is assumed to come from the following distributions
g „ MVNp0, σ2
gGq
(5.11)
s „ MVNp0, σ2
sSq
(5.12)
m „ MVNp0, σ2
mMq
(5.13)
v „ MVNp0, σ2
vVq.
(5.14)
In the above speciﬁcation, y denotes an n-dimensional vector of clinical outcomes.
We will assume that the residual variance is modeled by ε, which is multivariate
normal with mean zero residual inverse variance τ. The term g represents an n-
dimensional vector of normally distributed random eﬀects with known n ˆ n co-
variance matrix G “ XX⊺{pg, where X denotes an n ˆ pg genotype matrix of pg
gene expression measurements. G is the common genetic relatedness matrix (GRM)
and, as mentioned in previous chapters, models the genomic correlations between
individuals scaled by the total number of measured markers. Similarly, s is also
an n-dimensional vector of normally distributed random eﬀects with known n ˆ n
covariance matrix S “ EE⊺{ps, where E is an n ˆ ps matrix containing the SECT
130

summaries for each individual’s MRI scan and ps is the length of the topological sum-
mary vector for each individual. Here, S may be thought of as a GRM that captures
the similarity of the tumor shape between individuals. Lastly, the random eﬀects
m and v model the variance of morphometric and volumetric features, respectively,
where the interpretation of covariance matrices M and V is very similar to that of
S.
The motivation behind including each of these random components in Equation
(5.10) is to model tumor heterogeneity at both the molecular level through g, as
well as at the physiological level through s, m, and v. The argument for considering
tumor heterogeneity when predicting clinical responses is that there is overwhelming
evidence that even tumors of the same type can exhibit signiﬁcant distinct molecular
and geometric behavior in diﬀerent patients (Alizadeh et al., 2015).
We will consider variations of the model speciﬁed in Equation (5.10) with the ob-
jective of examining whether the SECT and topological summaries can improve pre-
diction accuracy for clinical outcomes — as opposed to the more standard biomarkers
of gene expression and morphometric/volumetric features. To this end, we specify
twelve models that can be clustered into distinct groups based on the data they
include.
1. y “ g ` ε
2. y “ g ` m ` ε
3. y “ g ` v ` ε
4. y “ g ` m ` v ` ε
5. y “ m ` ε
6. y “ v ` ε
7. y “ m ` v ` ε
8. y “ s ` ε
9. y “ s ` g ` ε
10. y “ s ` m ` ε
11. y “ s ` v ` ε
12. y “ s ` m ` v ` ε
Brieﬂy, Model 1 only includes gene expression data, Models 2-4 include both gene
expression and geometric features, Models 5-7 include only geometric features, and
131

Models 8-12 all include topological features via the SECT. A more detailed descrip-
tion for each of these models can be found in Table 5.1. For the rest of this section,
we will state prior speciﬁcations and outline posterior sampling schemes for the com-
plete MG-BLUP described in Equation (5.10) — but, note that any of the twelve
model variations detailed above may easily be adapted.
5.3.2
Prior and Hyper-prior Speciﬁcations
Given the MG-BLUP model representation in Equation (5.10), we take a Bayesian
approach and assume that each of the variance components come from the following
conjugate distribution
τ, σ´2
˚
„ Γpκ1, κ2q
(5.15)
where ˚ “ tg, s, m, vu, and Γ is used to denote a gamma distribution with κ1 and κ2
being the shape and rate parameters, respectively. When conducting posterior infer-
ence, we will exclusively consider the posterior distribution that arises in the limits
κ1 Ñ 0 and κ2 Ñ 0. We note that while these limits correspond to improper priors,
the resulting posteriors are proper, and most importantly, they scale appropriately
with shifting or scaling of the phenotype vector y (Servin and Stephens, 2007). In
other words, conclusions will be unaﬀected by changing the units of measurement of
the phenotype (Zhou et al., 2013). This property is desirable in our setting because
the phenotypic outcomes are assumed to be normalized. Moreover, in our particular
application to GBM, the phenotypic outcomes are being characterized by the physical
traits of the tumor, some of which are quantiﬁed topologically and therefore are also
invariant to scaling and shifting. This intersection of the two ﬁelds strengthens the
validity of our methodology in using this particular Bayesian analysis to topological
quantiﬁcations.
132

5.3.3
Posterior Inference and Sampling
Given the full model, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) via a Gibbs sampler
to obtain approximate samples from the joint posterior of the all parameters given
the observed data. Speciﬁcally, posterior samples of Θ “ tg, s, m, v, τ, σ2
g, σ2
s, σ2
m, σ2
vu
may be obtained by using the following closed form conditional densities:
1. g | y, Θ´g „ MVNpµ˚, Σ˚q where µ˚ “ τΣ˚py ´ s ´ m ´ vq and Σ˚ “
τ ´1σ2
gpτ ´1G ` σ2
gInq´1;
2. s | y, Θ´s „ MVNpµ˚, Σ˚q where µ˚ “ τΣ˚py ´ g ´ m ´ vq and Σ˚ “

sInq´1;
3. m | y, Θ´m „ MVNpµ˚, Σ˚q where µ˚ “ τΣ˚py ´ g ´ s ´ vq and Σ˚ “
τ ´1σ2
mpτ ´1M ` σ2
mInq´1;
4. v | y, Θ´v „ MVNpµ˚, Σ˚q where µ˚ “ τΣ˚py ´ g ´ s ´ mq and Σ˚ “
τ ´1σ2
vpτ ´1V ` σ2
vInq´1;
5. τ | y, Θ´τ „ Γpn{2, y⊺y{2q;
6. σ2
g | y, Θ´σ2g „ Γpn{2, g⊺G´1g{2q;
7. σ2
s | y, Θ´σ2s „ Γpn{2, s⊺S´1s{2q;
8. σ2
m | y, Θ´σ2m „ Γpn{2, m⊺M´1m{2q;
9. σ2
v | y, Θ´σ2v „ Γpn{2, v⊺V´1v{2q.
Here, we denote Θ´j to be the vector Θ without parameter j. Iterating the above
procedure T times results in a desired set of posterior draws t ˆΘptquT
t“1 with which
posterior inference maybe conducted. In this work, we will exclusively be concerned
with performing phenotypic prediction.
133

5.3.4
Conditional Prediction of Unobserved Phenotypes
We now formally deﬁne the conditional predicted response for a new and unobserved
patient. Given a new patient’s genotypes X˚, and the corresponding tumor shape
traits computed from the patient’s MRI scans, samples from the posterior predictive
distribution of y˚ are drawn as follows
Ery˚ | X˚, ˆΘs “
ż
y˚ppy˚ | X˚, ˆΘqdy˚.
(5.16)
In practice, this integral is analytically computed by simply plugging in the the poste-
rior estimates of the random eﬀects in the expression for the conditional expectation.
Note that marginal (i.e. population averaged) prediction is diﬀerent than conditional
(i.e. tumor shape class speciﬁc) prediction. In our context, marginal prediction rep-
resents population strata deﬁned by eﬀects of a patient’s gene expression, whereas
conditional predictions express comparisons holding the tumor shape speciﬁc random
eﬀects constant (Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh, 2009).
The justiﬁcation for exclusively considering conditional predictions for unob-
served phenotypes is that we may assume that every new unobserved patient will
have an image of their tumor taken during diagnosis. From a medical perspective, it
is generally unlikely that a patient with cancer, such as GBM, will have been inva-
sively genotyped without having ﬁrst done a noninvasive MRI scan. Hence, tumor
shape traits for patients with unobserved phenotypes will always be available.
5.4
Application: Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Glioblastoma
The main objective to our statistical analysis is to understand which of the four fea-
tures among gene expression, morphometric, volumetric, and topological features, or
which combination of these features, are the best predictors for two clinical outcomes:
disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
134

Gene expression is often used in cancer genomics as an assay to predict phe-
notypes and clinical outcomes. More recently, radiogenomic studies have indicated
associations between geometric features extracted from MRIs and gene expression
levels with patient prognosis (Akbari et al., 2014; Mazurowski et al., 2014; Macyszyn
et al., 2016; Law et al., 2006; Pope et al., 2012; Mazurowski et al., 2013; Li et al.,
2012; Gutman et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2013). For instance, certain imaging modal-
ities allow for the detection of necrotic regions, typically found in the anoxic centers
of tumors (Mohammadi et al., 2016; Gutman et al., 2015). Clinical studies of GBMs
have indicated that prognosis worsens as the degree of necrosis increases (Raza et al.,
2002; Lacroix et al., 2001; Hammoud et al., 1996). Similarly, characteristics such as
relative tumor blood volume have been used to identify brain tumors lacking epi-
dermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) mutations — an increasingly
relevant biomarker in the optimization of GBM therapy (Tykocinski et al., 2012). As
a result, radiological imaging of GBM patients has become a powerful noninvasive
tool for prediction of clinical outcome.
Our motivation for applying the SECT to images of GBMs is to study the perfor-
mance of the shape of the tumor as a predictor of clinical outcome. We hypothesize
that the shape of the tumor may be a better indicator of clinical prognosis than
gene expression.
Gene expression is known to be highly variable, particularly in
GBM (Verhaak et al., 2010), while physical traits of the tumor are comparatively
more stable. Volumetric, morphometric, and topological features are quantities that
capture the physical traits (shape) of the tumor. Moreover, we suspect that the
SECT, which captures the full shape information of the tumor, may outperform the
standard geometric and morphometric quantities in prediction of clinical outcome,
as well as in robustness to metric assumptions.
In our application to GBM, the robustness of the SECT to choice of metric is par-
ticularly relevant because the geometric structure of the brain is known to be ﬁbrous
135

— meaning that the brain is made up of, and connected by, cerebral ﬁber pathways
(Wedeen et al., 2012). This brings into the question of the validity of assuming a
usual Euclidean metric. Both volumetric and morphometric analyses require the
speciﬁcation of a metric, and in the case where the usual assumption of a Euclidean
metric does not apply, one must be constructed or assumed, which is not always a
straightforward task. Moreover, in ﬁbrous settings, there is also the possibility for
the further requirement of deﬁning a geodesic. Examining topological properties,
as opposed to metric-based properties, bypasses these technical diﬃculties, which
also bypasses the introduction of statistical confounders associated with erroneous
assumptions of metric or geodesic, or measurement errors.
Altogether, incorporating a topological measure that is not based on a metric
results in the ﬂexibility to compare tumors of diﬀerent sizes more seamlessly. Sub-
sequently, this also implicitly allows for comparisons between diﬀerent stages of the
disease to be examined without needing to account for time of progression. We hy-
pothesize that these ﬂexible characteristics will favor the SECT as a better predictor
of prognosis and survival.
5.4.1
Radiogenomic Data
MRIs of primary GBM tumors were collected from 92 patients archived by the The
Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) (Clark et al., 2013), which is a publicly accessi-
ble data repository of medical images of cancer patients with matched data in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) — a collection of a variety of genomic and clinical
data for 33 types of cancer.
The 92 patients were selected based on two sets of
criteria, namely, that they had post-contrast T1 axial MRIs taken at the time of
their diagnosis, and that they had available matching (mRNA) gene expression data
and clinical correlates (e.g. recorded DFS and OS) on cBioPortal (Gao et al., 2013).
There are two key factors that inﬂuenced our decision to use this particular dataset.
136

First, T1-weighted MRI with Gadolinium contrast (T1C) is a commonly-used imag-
ing modality that can assay lesions with vascular activity (Adin et al., 2015). Second,
exclusively using MRIs taken at the time of diagnosis allows us to avoid any potential
confounding factors related to treatment eﬀects that may manifest on postoperative
imaging (Macyszyn et al., 2016). In particular, considering patients that have un-
dergone diﬀerent treatment regimens and procedures could introduce false positives
into the model.
We segmented the TCIA MRI images using a computer-assisted segmentation
program to extract tumor lesions from the surrounding brain tissue, which ﬁrst con-
verts MRI images to a grayscale, and then thresholds to generate binary images. Mor-
phological segmentation is then applied to delineate connected components. More
speciﬁcally, the program selects contours corresponding to enhanced tumor lesions,
which are lighter than healthy brain tissue. As previously noted, necrosis presents
as dark regions nested within the indicated lesion. An example of the raw image
obtained from TCIA is given in Figure 5.7(a). The ﬁnal segmented result is given in
Figure 5.7(b).
Gene Expression Data.
The 92 TCGA samples was were preprocessed using MAS5.0
(Irizarry et al., 2003) to normalize the mRNA gene expression data and remove genes
that did not vary, or that posed concerns about the accuracy of the hybridization in
the assay. This resulted in 9215 of the original 18901 genes, pg “ 9215.
Morphometric Data.
The same morphometric features outlined in Chang et al. (2011)
and Han et al. (2010) were used in our study. The pipeline to compute these features
is outlined in detail in Chang et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, the ﬁrst step is to segment the
image.
The second step is to extract features from the segmented image.
This
resulted in the number of features corresponding to shape and texture, pm “ 212.
137

Volumetric Data.
From the segmented images, we also calculated the following vol-
umetric features: the enhancing volume for each slice, summed over lesions in the
multifocal case; the core volume of the enhancing and necrotic regions; the longest
diameter of the lesions; and the shape factor, which we deﬁne to be the longest di-
ameter divided by the diameter of a sphere of the same volume. The total number
of features was pv “ 5.
Topological Data.
Among the 92 segmented images, each consisted of 23-25 slices
of two dimensional greyscale images (the exact number of slices varies by patient).
For the binary images, we compute a two-dimensional SECT for each slice over 72
directions evenly sampled over r0, 2πs. Each of the N “ 72 smooth EC curves are
vectors of length q “ 100, the ﬁxed number of sublevel sets. We average the smooth
EC curves for a ﬁxed direction across all slices, so if we index directions as ν and
slices as q we ﬁrst compute 72 EC curves e “ tcνuN
ν“1 by averaging over all L the
slices:
¯cν “ 1
L
Lÿ
ℓ“1
cνℓ,
where cνℓis the smooth EC curve for the ℓ-th slice in direction ν. For an image from
patient i, we obtain 72 vectors of length 100 which we concatenate into one vector
of length q ˆ N which we denote as ei. Given n patients, the imaging data will be
represented as an nˆps matrix which we denote as E “ re1 ¨ ¨ ¨ ens, where ps “ qˆN.
Clinical Phenotypes.
We considered two clinical outcomes.
• Disease Free Survival (DFS): The period after a successful treatment during
which there are no signs or symptoms of the cancer that was treated.
• Overall Survival (OS): The entire period after the start of treatment during
which the cancer patient is still alive.
138

DFS is more commonly used over OS in adjuvant cancer clinical trials, because it
oﬀers earlier presentation of data (Sargent et al., 2005). In particular, this stems
from the idea that events due to disease recurrence occur earlier than death from
disease (Birgisson et al., 2011).
5.4.2
Prediction Results
In our statistical analyses, we compared the predictive accuracy for both clinical
outcomes for each type of data feature: gene expression, morphometric, volumetric,
and topological summaries. Our ﬁndings show that for DFS, the topological features
result in the most accurate predictions, while gene expression is the least informative
of the features. For OS, the volumetric features are the best predictive indicators.
As measures of predictive performance, we used two metrics described in Hahn
et al. (2013) to compare out-of-sample predictive accuracy: root mean square error of
prediction (RMSEP); and the tabulated frequency for which a given method exhibits
the lowest RMSEP, which we denote as Pr[Optimal]. To perform the prediction, we
split the data into 80% training and 20% out-of-sample test sets, and ran 500 of these
splits for both DFS and OS. Numerical results under both metrics are presented in
Table 5.2. We treated the gene expression only model as a baseline (Model 1 in Table
5.2) and report the RMSEP of all the other methods relative to Model 1 (see Figure
5.8).
Models with Geometric Features.
In our comparison study, we were able to replicate
previous ﬁndings that morphometric or volumetric features (summarized as geomet-
ric features) are useful predictors of outcome phenotypes: This was reﬂected in the
mixed eﬀects models, since Models 5-7 exhibited robustly low RMSEPs in predicting
both DFS and OS. This result is consistent with other radiogenomics studies that
found geometric traits such as core volume, longest diameter, and shape factor of
139

the largest lesion to be better predictors of clinical outcome than gene expression
(Gutman et al., 2013; Hammoud et al., 1996; Itakura et al., 2015; Mazurowski et al.,
2014).
Models with Topological Features.
The random eﬀects model that included only topo-
logical features was able to most accurately predict DFS (RMSEP = 0.897 and
Pr[Optimal] = 0.292). Recall that DFS is deﬁned as as the time period between ini-
tial treatment and ﬁrst recurrence of the disease. DFS is arguably the most important
clinical outcome for patients with GBM because recurrence rates are high („90%)
(Weller et al., 2012). Our ﬁndings suggest that the topological shape features cap-
tured by the SECT contains more predictive information about GBM relapse than
both gene expression, geometric features.
One possible explanation for our results is that there may be correlations between
the topological features of tumors, and tumor heterogeneity potentially arising from
the activation of diﬀerent molecular recurrence mechanisms. An example of this cor-
relation occurs in certain multicentric and multifocal tumors — tumors with lesions
in opposing hemispheres of the brain that arise from the same oncogenic eﬀects —
that exhibit heterogeneity within only one hemisphere. This variation can be clin-
ically relevant. In Lee et al. (2016), a case study is described where a multicentric
tumor relapsed in only one hemisphere of the brain, and the relapse took the form of
multifocal lesions. The authors then go on to show that clinical prognostics correlate
directly with the multicentricity and multifocality of tumors, and they draw connec-
tions between these topological traits and the mutation status of oncogenic relapse
drivers such as PIK3CA. This provides evidence that the existence of underlying
characteristics of resistance and relapse mechanisms of the disease go beyond the
simple consideration of proximity in a geometric sense. For instance, these charac-
teristics may be due to ambient eﬀects inherent to the particular hemisphere of the
140

brain. The prediction results we present in this work suggest that the topological
features extracted by the SECT may be better than simple geometric summaries at
providing insight into biological phenomena at the molecular level.
Predicting DFS vs. OS.
While the random eﬀects models that included topological
features predicted DFS most accurately, the random eﬀects models that included
geometric features were the most accurate in predicting OS. We conjecture that the
discrepancy in predictive performance is due to the nature of the clinical outcome
measures.
DFS, as mentioned previously, is a prognostic measure that depends on relapse,
which corresponds to the existence of the disease after initial treatment. This notion
is better captured by topological features, which in our cancer application, details
the presence of tumors. Measurements that encompass information on the aggres-
siveness of the disease are not as relevant as those that measure sheer existence. This
corresponds to a topological trait, rather than a volumetric or morphometric one.
OS, on the other hand, is a prognostic measure that depends on survival of the
patient, which is better described by features that capture the aggressiveness of
the disease. There have been studies that show a correlation between volumetric
features and biological aggressiveness of tumors (Talos et al., 2007; Leong et al.,
2015). Geometric features, such as size and location of the tumor and especially its
proximity to crucial regions of the brain, give some measure about the aggressiveness
of the disease and therefore directly impact survival of the patient.

Discussion
In this chapter, we introduced the smooth Euler characteristic transform (SECT) as a
topological summary of shapes designed to integrate shape information into standard
statistical models. Here, we used the SECT features in a variance component model
141

to predict clinical outcomes based on gene expression and imaging data. We found
that the topological characteristics captured by the SECT were the most accurate
predictors for disease free survival. More speciﬁcally, the topological features out-
performed gene expression measurements, as well as volumetric and morphometric
features.
There are several interesting future directions and open problems involving the
use of topological features, such as the SECT, in radiogenomics.
We state four
particular directions below.
Shape Reconstruction.
It would be useful to infer which particular regions of the
tumor are most relevant to predicting outcome. Standard variable selection methods
can be used to infer the directions and segments of the Euler curves most relevant to
prediction. An important open problem is to recover or reconstruct a shape from the
SECT, or part of a shape from a subset of SECT. We have some preliminary results
indicating that an algorithm to reconstruct the shape, or a region of the shape, from
topological summaries such as the SECT is possible. Overlaying signiﬁcant regions
of interest with molecular markers and signaling pathways would be interesting to
be able to further understand the exact mechanics of the disease.
The Shape of a Tumor and Disease Etiology.
The distance measure for the SECT
stated in equation (5.9) provides a framework for comparing the shapes of tumors,
and correlating shape with molecular and clinical features. Understanding the ef-
fect of variation over tumor shapes on therapies, pre- and post-treatment, as well
as diﬀerences between treatment strategies would provide useful information about
diﬀerent forms of GBM, and more generally, cancer. We conjecture that greater
knowledge about the shape of a tumor may help in distinguishing true progression
from pseudoprogression: progression is the growth of the tumor itself, while in pseu-
142

doprogression, the tumor is inﬁltrated by immune cells and other factors.
Integration With Other Features.
There is evidence that epigenomic features, such
as DNA methylation, provide predictive information on clinical prognosis and tu-
mor heterogeneity (Zhang et al., 2015; Hansen et al., 2011). Methylation is also a
more stable molecular marker than gene expression, and therefore may be a better
predictor variable of outcome. The existence of correlations between methylation
and imaging would provide a proxy measurement of the epigenome which is far less
invasive.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Using Shape Statistics.
An important procedure in can-
cer biology is to examine sets of genes that belong to a signaling pathway, and to
compute the gene set score that captures dysregulation in the pathway (Subrama-
nian et al., 2005b; Drier et al., 2013; Edelman et al., 2008). It would of interest to
probe whether variation in shape is correlated with pathway dysregulation.

at radius zero, the number of components is exactly n and as the radius increases,
components merge (or die). The cycles show up later in this process. There are
two bars that are signiﬁcantly longer than the others (one in H0 and one in H1).

ECTs for a ﬁxed direction ν P Sd´1, the shapes that generate this ECT diﬀer. It is
important to note that enough directions must be considered for injectivity of the
ECT and SECT to hold.

A.1
BAKR Mixed Model Extension
There are applications where a nonlinear mixed model is desired. Examples of this
include cases where the observations are not independent but related via some popu-
lation structure or known kinship, or cases where one needs to control for confounders
such as batch eﬀects. Here, we detail a nonlinear mixed regression model. The ex-
tension to binary classiﬁcation is straightforward based on the steps outlined for the
BAKR-probit model in the main text. One can adapt the empirical factor represen-
tation of BAKR to include a random component as follows:
yi “ ˜u⊺
i θ ` ϕi ` εi,
εi „ N
`
0, σ2
ε
˘
,
ϕi
|ù
εi
(A.1)
with Eryi | ϕis “ ˜u⊺
i θ ` ϕi and ϕi is independent of εi. Jointly, ϕ “ rϕ1, . . . , ϕns⊺are
assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and covariance structure ∆. In
our applications, ∆is not diagonal or block-diagonal, which implies that the elements
in the response vector y are correlated via the random eﬀects (Liu et al., 2007). In
the statistical genetics context, the relevance of the random eﬀect is that the ﬁxed
and random eﬀects capture a larger portion of the total covariance structure and
151

allow for more accurate posterior summaries of quantities of interest, such as eﬀect
sizes. This correction increases the model’s power to detect true causal variants,
rather than falsely identifying signiﬁcant covariates that may have large eﬀect sizes
simply due to correlations with the population structure (Kang et al., 2010, 2008;
Yang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010b). A standard approach in quantitative and
statistical genetics is to deﬁne the covariance of ϕ as a known kinship matrix ∆
which can model either direct family relations between individuals or population
structure across individuals, and is estimated from SNP data (Yang et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2010c). This ﬂexibility of the linear mixed model is a major reason it is
used in applications such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Yang et al.,
2014).
We specify the following hierarchical model

(A.2)
Note that the model speciﬁcation is almost identical to the original BAKR formulation—
the diﬀerence is the addition of simulating the random eﬀects from the kinship matrix
∆. We will call this version of the model, the BAKR mixed model (BAKR-MM).
Given the model speciﬁcation in (A.2) we can again use a Gibbs sampler to
draw from the joint posterior distribution ppθ, σ2
θ, σ2

consists of iterated sampling of the following conditional densities:

Once again, the second step is deterministic and maps back to the eﬀect size ana-
logues ˆβ. Iterating the above procedure T times results in a set of samples
␣ˆβptq(T
t“1.
Prediction under this mixed modeling extension is similar to that of a Gaussian
process or any other standard nonparametric statistical methods (Pillai et al., 2007).
The response variables to be predicted are simply missing random variables that
we will impute. The MCMC algorithm above can be easily adapted to allow for
the sampling of the missing response variables.
Partition the vector of response
variables y into a set of training yt and validation samples yv. The design matrix
can be similarly partitioned rXt; Xvs. Under the randomized feature map ˜ψ, the
approximate kernel matrix rK and its eigenvalue decomposition rU are formulated
based on the full design matrix X. The matrix Xv implicitly forms part of the model
and the kernel factor prior structure, even though the corresponding responses are
missing. We now add an additional step to the MCMC procedure where yv is imputed
from the implied conditional posterior, which will be a draw from multivariate normal
distribution for this model.
There are some issues to consider with this model speciﬁcation and inference
procedure. The inferences are made using all the data, including Xv. Therefore,
if any new validation samples are introduced, the entire analysis must be repeated
153

(West, 2003). Furthermore, posterior inferences on the original covariate eﬀect sizes
begin to lose meaning and interpretability when the sample size of the training set
is smaller than that of the validation set (i.e. nt ă nv). Often the objective is to
make inferences on a set of explanatory variables, while correcting for population
structure—meaning, there is no testing set to be considered.
A.2
Variance Partitioning of Mice Phenotypes
For the variance component analysis, we consider a linear mixed model with multiple
variance components (Morota et al., 2014; Zhou, 2016). Speciﬁcally, this random
eﬀect model is formulated as the following:
y “ g1 ` g2 ` g3 ` gc ` ε,
ε „ MVNnp0, τ 2Inq
(A.3)
where g1 „ MVNnp0, ω2Kq is the linear eﬀects component; g2 „ MVNnp0, σ2K2q is
the pairwise interaction component; g3 „ MVNnp0, ν2K3q is the third order inter-
action component; and gc „ MVNnp0, κ2Cq is the common environmental compo-
nent. One can think of gc as structured noise and ε as random noise. Here, we let
tω2, σ2, ν2, κ2, τ 2u be corresponding random eﬀect variance terms. The matrix In is
an n ˆ n identity matrix. The matrix K “ XX⊺{p is a linear kernel (Gram) matrix
(Jiang and Reif, 2015; Keerthi and Lin, 2003). The matrix K2 “ K ˝ K represents
a pairwise interaction relationship matrix and is obtained by using the Hadamard
product (i.e. the squaring of each element) of the linear kernel matrix with itself.
The matrix K3 “ K ˝ K ˝ K represents a third order interaction relationship matrix
(i.e. the cubing of each element), and C is a matrix of common environmental factors
where: Cij “ 1 if mouse i and j are from the same cage.
The point of this analysis is to directly estimate the contribution of nonlinear ef-
fects across an array of diﬀerent phenotypes and traits, particularly amongst samples
that are related through some common environmental structure. We quantify these
154

contributions by examining the portion of phenotypic variance explained (pPVE)
using the following equation (Zhou et al., 2013; Zhou, 2016):
pPVEi9
ˆδi
n trpΣiq
and
ÿ
i
pPVEi “ 1,
where Σ “ rK, K2, K3, Cs. We speciﬁcally plot the pPVEs corresponding to the
random eﬀect variance terms ˆδ “ pˆω2, ˆσ2, ˆν2, ˆκ2q in Figure 2.2(b).
The variance
component that explains the greatest portion of the overall PVE then represents the
most inﬂuential eﬀect onto that particular phenotypic response. We run this anal-
ysis using the -vc argument within GEMMA software. Each phenotype is quantile
normalized before running the analysis in GEMMA.

this table lists genomic regions with at least two SNPs having PPAAs satisfying the

its corresponding marginal p-value. The marginal p-values reported are found via
linear regression. Rows listed in bold are those for which we did not ﬁnd any sources

regions could potentially be novel. *Multiple SNPs in the HLA region are signiﬁcant,
so we choose the SNP with the lowest marginal p-value.

Table B.1: Computational eﬃciency for running MAPIT as a function of sample
size and the number of SNPs. Each entry represents the mean computation time (in
minutes) it takes to run MAPIT under diﬀerent hypothesis testing strategies. These
tests are the normal test, and the Davies method for approximating a mixture of chi-
squares. Computations were performed using 32 cores on Duke University’s Center
for Genomic and Computational Biology HARDAC Cluster. To create genetic data
for these simulations, we generated 5 ˆ 103, 1 ˆ 104, 5 ˆ 104, and 1 ˆ 105 genetic
markers, respectively. Sample sizes were set to 1,000, 2,500, and 5,000. Values in
the parentheses are the standard deviations of the estimates.

Table B.2: Empirical type I error estimates of MAPIT in the presence of population
stratiﬁcation eﬀects (Top 5 PCs). Each entry represents type I error rate estimates
as the proportion of p-values a under the null hypothesis based on 100 simulated
continuous phenotypes for the normal test (or z-test) and the Davies method. These

5 genotype PCs. Recall that model (ii) is used to evaluate the type I error control
of MAPIT when there is population stratiﬁcation. Empirical size for the analyses
used signiﬁcance thresholds of α “ 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. Sample sizes were set to

Figure B.16: QQ-plots of the MAPIT p-values for all SNP-gene pairs in the GEU-

matrix Kcis, where for the expression of each gene Kcis was computed using only the
corresponding cis-SNPs. Figure (b) corresponds to using MAPIT with a genome-
wide genetic relatedness matrix KGW, where KGW was computed using all SNPs in
the study. Figure (c) illustrates results from using MAPIT after we ﬁrst controlled
for residual population stratiﬁcation eﬀects. Under this approach, we ﬁrst create
a matrix Z with the top 10 genotypic principal components, respectively.
Next,
we regress the population stratiﬁcation eﬀects Z onto the expression of each gene
and save the residuals. Finally, we implement MAPIT on the residuals using the
genome-wide genetic relatedness matrix KGW.

the MAPIT p-values for all variants in the GEUVADIS data set using the genome-
wide genetic relatedness matrix KGW, before and after correction for residual pop-
ulation stratiﬁcation, respectively. The horizontal red line corresponds to a uniform

wise interactions (y-axis) identiﬁed by MAPIT (green) and GEMMA (purple) when
searching between the top v “ t50, 100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500u marginally asso-

exhaustive search model in PLINK (i.e. 3,335 in (b) and 3,906 in (d)) as a baseline
(orange dotted line). Note that PLINK only analyzes cis-SNPs pairs, while MAPIT
with KGW eﬀectively analyzes the marginal epistatic eﬀects of cis-SNPs with all
genome-wide SNPs.

of locations for signiﬁcant SNPs, relative to the 51 most gene transcription start
site (TSS) and the 31 most gene transcription end site (TES). Figure (a) displays
the marginally epistatic QTL (mepiQTL) detected by MAPIT using the genetic
relatedness matrix KGW. The x-axis of each plot divides a typical cis-candidate
region into a series of bins. Figure (b) corresponds to the mepiQTL identiﬁed by
MAPIT using KGW, after we ﬁrst controlled for residual population stratiﬁcation
eﬀects. The y-axis plots the number of SNPs in each bin that have a p-value less
than Bonferroni corrected genome-wide signiﬁcance threshold (P “ 1.875 ˆ 10´8),
divided by the total number of SNPs in that bin. Bars in green denote the region
bounded by the TSS and TES, with gene lengths divided into 20 bins for visibility —
because the gene body is thus artiﬁcially enlarged, SNP density within genes cannot
be directly compared with SNP density outside of genes.

Additive Effects
Pairwise Epistatic Effects
Figure B.20: Estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained (PVE)
by additive and pairwise epistatic eﬀects for each gene analyzed in the GEUVADIS
data set. Estimates of the pPVE on the y-axis were calculated by using variance
component models, where each of the components represent for additive eﬀects (grey)
and pairwise epistasis (green). More speciﬁcally, the variance components correspond
to additive and pairwise epistatic covariance matrices K and K2, respectively. Note
that K2 “ K ˝ K is obtained by using the Hadamard product (i.e. the squaring of
each element) of the matrix K. See Methods and Material for details.

Software Availability
C.1
BAKR: Bayesian Approximate Kernel Regression
Software for implementing BAKR is carried out in R and Rcpp code, which is freely
available at https://github.com/lorinanthony/BAKR.
C.2
MAPIT: MArginal ePIstasis Test
The software implementing MAPIT is also freely available at https://github.com/
lorinanthony/MAPIT. We use the CompQuadForm R package to compute p-values
from the Davies method. The Davies method can sometimes yield a p-value equal
exactly to 0 when the true p-value is extremely small (Chen et al., 2013). In this
case, we report p-values as P « 0. If this is of concern, one can compute the p-values
for MAPIT using Kuonen’s saddlepoint method (Kuonen, 1999; Chen et al., 2013)
or Satterthwaite’s approximation equation (Satterthwaite, 1946).

C.3
SECT: The Smooth Euler Characteristic Transform
Software to compute the ECT and SECT from images is publicly available from the
Rabad´an Lab GitHub repository https://github.com/RabadanLab/SECT. Poste-
rior estimation via Gibbs sampling and prediction for the Bayesian LMM was car-
ried out in R version 3.3.1 (R Core Team, 2016) using the publicly available BGLR
software package (de los Campos et al., 2010; Crossa et al., 2014; Howard et al.,
2014). The segmented images in addition to the gene expression, volumetric, and
morphometric data as well as the scripts generating the ﬁgures and tables in the
paper are also publicly available on the Rabad´an Lab GitHub repository.
