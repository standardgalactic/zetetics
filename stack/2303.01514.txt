sources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or
deploy, available perception and action resources in a context speciﬁc way. We show here

that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the free-energy
principle (and hence can be considered Bayesian prediction-error minimizers), their control
ﬂow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as
control systems can be implmented within the general framework of quantum topological
neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological sys-
tems at multiple scales.

Introduction
Living things oﬀer remarkable examples of complex, multi-level control policies that guide
adaptive function at several scales. At the same time, they are made of components which
are usually thought of as physical objects obeying simple rules; how can these two per-
spectives be uniﬁed in a rigorous manner? The framework of active inference answers this
question be providing a completely general, scale-free formal framework for describing in-
teractions between physical systems in cognitive terms. It is based on the Free Energy
Principle (FEP), ﬁrst introduced in neuroscience [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] before being extended to
living systems in general [6, 7, 8, 9] and then to all self-organizing systems [10, 11, 12, 13].
The FEP states that any system that interacts with its environment weakly enough to
maintain its identiﬁability over time 1) has a Markov blanket (MB) that separates its inter-
nal states from the states of its environment [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and 2) behaves over time in
a way that asymptotically minimizes a variational free energy (VFE) measured at its MB.
Equivalently, the FEP states that any system with a non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS)
solution to its density dynamics (and hence an MB) will act so as to maintain its state in
the vicinity of its NESS. Any system compliant with the FEP can be described as engaging,
at all times, in active inference: a cyclic process in which the system observes its environ-
ment, updates its probabilistic “Bayesian beliefs” (i.e., posterior or conditional probability
densities) over future behaviors, and acts on its environment so as to test its predictions
and gain additional information. The internal dynamics of such a system can be described
as inverting a generative model (GM) of its environment that furnishes predictions of the
consequences of its actions on its MB.
As a fully-general principle, the FEP applies to all physical systems, not just to behav-
iorally interesting, plausibly cognitive systems, such as organisms or autonomous robots
[10]. Intuitively, behavior is interesting – to external observers and, we can assume, to
the behaving system itself – when it is complex, situation-appropriate, and robust in the
face of changing environmental conditions. Friston et al. [13] characterize interesting sys-
tems as “strange particles”, whose internal (i.e., cognitive) states are inﬂuenced by their
actions only via perceived environmental responses; such systems have to “ask questions”
of their environments in order to get answers [19]. Such systems, even bacteria and other
basal organisms [20, 21, 22, 23], have multiple ways of observing and acting upon their
environments and deploy these resources in context-sensitive ways. In operations-research
language, they exhibit situational awareness, i.e., awareness of the context of actions [24],
and deploy attention systems to manage the informational, thermodynamic, and metabolic
costs of maintaining such awareness [12, 22]. Situational awareness is dependent on both
short- and long-term memory, or more technically, on the period of time over which precise
[Bayesian] beliefs exist, sometimes referred to as the temporal depth or horizon of the GM
[20, 21]. Upper limits can, therefore, be placed on behavioral complexity by examining
the capacity and control of memory systems from the cellular scale [25] upwards. Liv-
ing systems from microbial mats to human societies employ stigmergic memories [22] and
hence have “extended minds” [26] in the sense of the literature on embodied, embedded,
enactive, extended, and aﬀective (4EA) cognition [27, 28]. Such memories must be both
3

readable and writable; hence any system using them must have dedicated, memory-speciﬁc
perception–action capabilities.
Any system with multiple perception–action (or stimulus–response) capabilities requires a
control system that enables context-guided perception and action and precluding the con-
tinuous, simultaneous deployment of all available perception–action capabilities. Such self
organization entails the selection of a particular course of action – i.e., policy – from all
plausible policies entertained by the system’s GM. In the active inference framework, the
system’s internal states – hence its GM – can be read as encoding posterior probability
densities (i.e., Bayesian beliefs) over the causes of its sensory states, including, crucially, its
own actions. This leads to the notion of planning and control as inference [29, 30, 31], with
the ensuing selection of an action given by the most likely policy. In bacteria such as E.
coli, for example, mutual inhibition between gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for diﬀerent
metabolic operons permit the expression of speciﬁc carbon-source (e.g., sugar) metabolism
pathways only when the target carbon source is detected in the environment [32]. The con-
trol of foraging behavior via chemotaxis employs a similar, in this case bistable, mechanism
[33]. Such mechanisms are active in multicellular morphogenesis, for example, in the head-
versus-tail morphology decision in planaria [34]. In the human brain, mutual inhibition
between competing visual processing streams is evident in binocular rivalry (switching be-
tween distinct scenes presented to left and right eyes) or in the changing interpretations of
ambiguous ﬁgures such as the Necker cube [35, 36]; similar competitive eﬀects are observed
in other sensory pathways [37]. It also characterizes the competitive interaction between the
dorsal and ventral attention systems, which implement top-down and bottom-up targeting
of sensory resources, respectively [38]. It is invoked at a still larger scale in global workspace
models of conscious processing, in which incoming information streams must compete, with
each inhibiting the others, for “access to consciousness” [39, 40]. Mutual inhibition cre-
ates an energetic barrier that the control system that implements switching must expend
free-energy resources to overcome; the controller must not only turn “on” the preferred
system, but also turn “oﬀ” the inhibition. The required free energy expenditure in turn
induces hysteresis and hence the non-linear, winner-takes-all “switch” behavior in the time
regime. Such barriers and their temporal consequences persist in more complex control
systems whenever two perception–action capabilities are either functionally incompatible
or too expensive to deploy simultaneously.
Switching between perception–action capabilities can be regarded, from a theoretical, FEP
perspective, as selecting a plausible policy, or plan, supported by the GM. Technically, the
probability distribution over policies or plans can be computed from a free energy functional
expected under the posterior predictive density over possible outcomes, as described in §2.1
below. The control system that implements the switching process can be considered to
employ the GM to predict, or assign probability distribution to, each perception-action
capability (i.e., policy) as a function of context [41, 42].
We can consider the GM to
generate probabilistic “beliefs” about the consequences of actions, where here a “belief” is
just a mathematically-described structure, e.g., a classical conditional probability density
or a quantum state with an assigned amplitude. “Planning” or “control” can, therefore,
4

always be cast as inference – again in the basal sense of computation – implemented by
variational message passing or “belief propagation” on a (normal style) factor graph: a
graph with nodes corresponding to the factors of a probability distribution and undirected
edges corresponding to message-passing channels. Factor graphs can be combined with
message passing schemes, with the messages generally corresponding to suﬃcient statistics
of the factors in question, to provide an eﬃcient computation of functions such as marginal
densities [43, 44]. Hence one can formalize control – under the FEP – in terms of control as
inference, which implies that there is a description of control in terms of message passing
on a factor graph. When the GM is over discrete states, this implies a description of control
in terms of tensor operators.
Nearly all simulations of planning – under discrete state space GMs – use the factor-
graph formalism. Crucially, the structure of the factor graph embodies the structure of the
GM and, eﬀectively, the way that any system represents the (apparent causes of) data on
its MB; i.e., the way it “carves nature at its joints,” into states, objects and categorical
features. Under the (classical) FEP, the factors that constitute the nodes of the factor
graph correspond to the state-space factorization in a mean ﬁeld approximation, as used
by physicists, or by statisticians to implement variational Bayesian (a.k.a., approximate
Bayesian) inference [45]. See [46] for technical details, [47] for an application to the brain,
and Supplementary Information, Table 1 for a list of selected applications.
We show in this paper that control ﬂow in such systems can always be formally described
as a tensor network, a factorization of some overall tensor (i.e., high-dimensional matrix)
operator into multiple component tensor operators that are pairwise contracted on shared
degrees of freedom [48]. In particular, we show that the factorization conditions that allow
the construction of a TN are exactly the same as those that allow the identiﬁcation of
distinct, mutually conditionally independent (in quantum terms, decoherent), sets of data
on the MB, and hence allow the identiﬁcation of distinct “objects” or “features” in the en-
vironment. This equivalence allows the topological structures of TNs – many of which have
been well-characterized in applications of the TN formalism to other domains [48] – to be
employed as a classiﬁcation of control structures in active inference systems; including cells,
organisms, and multi-organism communities. It allows, in particular, a principled approach
to the question of whether, and to what extent, a cognitive system can impose a decom-
positional or mereological (i.e., part-whole) structure on its environment. Such structures
naturally invoke a notion of locality, and hence of geometry. The geometry of spacetime
itself has been described as a particular TN – a multiscale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA) [49, 50, 51] – suggesting a deep link between control ﬂow in systems capable
of observing spacetime (i.e., capable of implementing internal representations of spacetime)
and the deep structure of spacetime as a physical construct.
We begin in §2 by analyzing the control-ﬂow problem in three diﬀerent representations of
active inference. First, we employ the classical, statistical formulation of the FEP [10, 11]
in §2.1 to describe control ﬂow as implementing discrete, probabilistic transitions between
dynamical attractors on a manifold of computational states.
We then reformulate the
physical interaction in quantum information-theoretic terms in §2.2; in this formulation [12],
5

components of the GM can be considered to be distinct quantum reference frames (QRFs)
[52, 53] and represented by hierarchical networks of Barwise-Seligman classiﬁers [54] as
developed in [55, 56, 57, 58]. Control ﬂow then implements discrete transitions between
QRFs.
The third step, in §2.3, employs the mapping between hierarchies of classiﬁers
and topological quantum ﬁeld theories (TQFTs) developed in [59].
Here, control ﬂow
is implemented by a TQFT, with transition amplitudes given by a path integral.
The
second and third of these representations provide formal characterizations of intrinsic (or
“quantum”) context eﬀects that are consistent with both the sheaf-theoretic treatment of
contextuality in [60, 61] and the Contextuality by Default (CbD) approach of [62, 63];
see also the discussion in [57] and [59, §7.2]. The underlying theme is that contextuality
arises due to the non-existence of any globally deﬁnable (maximally connected) conditional
probability distribution across all possible observations (see e.g., [64] for a review from a
more general physics perspective). Extending our earlier analysis [57], we discuss reasons
to expect that active inference systems will generically exhibit such context eﬀects.
We then develop in §3 a fully-general tensor representation of control ﬂow, and prove
that this tensor can be factored into a TN if, and only if, the separability (or conditional
statistical independence) conditions needed to identify distinct features of or objects in
the environment are met. We show how TN architecture allows classiﬁcation of control
ﬂows, and give two illustrative examples. We discuss in §4 several established relationships
between TNs and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) architectures, and how these generalize
to topological quantum neural networks [59, 65], of which standard deep-learning (DL)
architectures are a classical limit [66]. We turn in §5 to implications of these results for
biology, and discuss how TN architectures correlate with the observational capabilities of
the system being modeled, particularly as regards abilities to detect spatial locality and
mereology. We consider how to classify known control pathways in terms of TN architecture
and how to employ the TN representation of control ﬂow in experimental design.
We
conclude by looking forward to how these FEP-based tools can further integrate the physical
and life sciences.

Formal description of the control problem
2.1
The attractor picture
Let U be a random dynamical system that can be decomposed into subsystems with states
µ(t), b(t), and η(t) such that the dependence of the µ(t) on the η(t), and vice-versa, is only
via the b(t). In this case, the b(t) form an MB separating the µ(t) from the η(t). We will refer
to the µ(t) as “internal” states, to the η(t) as “environment” states, and to the combined
π(t) = (b(t), µ(t)) as “particular” (or “particle”) states [10]. The FEP is a variational or
least-action principle stating that any system – that interacts suﬃciently weakly with its
environment – can be considered to be enclosed by an MB, i.e. any “particle” with states
π(t) = (b(t), µ(t)), will evolve in a way that tends to minimize a variational free energy
6

(VFE) F(π) that is an upper bound on (Bayesian) surprisal. This free energy is eﬀectively
the divergence between the variational density encoded by internal states and the density
over external states conditioned on the MB states. It can be written [10, Eq. 2.3],
F(π) = Eq(η)[ln qµ(η) −ln p(η, b)]

The VFE functional F(π) is an upper bound on surprisal (a.k.a. self-information) I(π) =
−ln p(π) > −ln p(b) because the Kullback-Leibler divergence term (DKL) is always non-
negative. This KL divergence is between the density over external states η, given the MB
state b, and a variational density Qµ(η) over external states parameterized by the internal
state µ. If we view the internal state µ as encoding a posterior over the external state η,
minimizing VFE is, eﬀectively, minimizing a prediction error, under a GM encoded by the
NESS density. In this treatment, the NESS density becomes a probabilistic speciﬁcation
of the relationship between external or environmental states and particular (i.e., “self”)
states. We can interpret the internal and active MB states in terms of active inference,
i.e., a Bayesian mechanics [11], in which their expected ﬂow can be read as perception
and action, respectively. Here “active” states are a subset of the MB states that are not
inﬂuenced by environmental states and – for the kinds of particles considered here – do
not inﬂuence internal states.
In other words, active inference is a process of Bayesian
belief updating that incorporates active exploration of the environment.
It is one way
of interpreting a generalized synchrony between two random dynamical systems that are
coupled via an MB.
If the “particle” π is a biological cell, it is natural to consider the MB b to be implemented
by the cell membrane and the “internal” states µ to be the internal macromolecular or
biochemical states of the cell; indeed, it is this association that motivated the application of
the FEP to cellular life [5]. In this case, the NESS corresponds to the state, or neighborhood
of states, that maintain homeostasis (or more broadly, allostasis [67, 68, 69]) and hence
maintain the structural and functional integrity of π as a living cell. This activity of self-
maintenance has been termed “self-evidencing” [70]; systems compliant with the FEP can
be considered to be continually generating evidence of – or for – their continued existence
[10].
In the terminology of [13] cells are “strange particles” – their signal transduction pathways
monitor (components of) the states of their environments, but do not directly monitor their
actions on their environments (i.e., their own active states). The consequences of any action
7

can only, therefore, be deduced from the response of the environment. In this situation,
causation is always uncertain: whether an action by the environment on the cell – what
the cell detects as an environmental state change – is a causal consequence of an action the
cell has taken in the past cannot be determined by the data available to the cell. Every
action, therefore, increases VFE, while every observation (potentially) decreases it. The
(apparent) task of the cell’s GM is to minimize the increases, on average, while maximizing
the decreases.
The Bayesian mechanics aﬀorded by the FEP implies a (classical) thermodynamics; in-
deed, the FEP can be read as a constrained maximum entropy or caliber principle [71, 72]
(Sakthivadivel 2022, Sakthivadivel 2022). This follows from the fact that inference, i.e., self
evidencing, entails belief updating and belief updating incurs a thermodynamic cost via the
Jarzynski equality [73, 74, 75]. This cost provides a lower bound on the thermodynamic free
energy required for metabolic maintenance. For example, a cell’s actions on its environment
– e.g., chemotactic locomotion – are largely driven by the need to acquire thermodynamic
free energy. The cell’s GM cannot, therefore, minimize VFE by minimizing action [76];
instead, it must successfully predict which actions will replenish its free-energy supply. As
actions are energetically expensive, this requires trading oﬀshort-term costs against long-
term goals. As shown in [41], selective pressures operating on diﬀerent timescales favor the
development of metaprocessors that control lower-level actions in a context-dependent way;
these are often implemented via a hierarchical GM [77]. Such meta-level control provides
probabilistic models of risk-sensitive actions in context.
While such systems may be described as regulating free-energy seeking actions, they also
regulate information-seeking actions, i.e., curiosity-driven exploration [78, 79, 80]. This
follows because VFE provides an upper bound on complexity minus accuracy [81]. The
expected free energy (EFE), conditioned upon any action, can therefore be scored in terms
of expected complexity and expected inaccuracy. Expected complexity is “risk” and cor-
responds to the degree of belief updating that incurs a thermodynamic cost; leading to
risk-sensitive control (e.g., phototropism). Expected inaccuracy corresponds to “ambigu-
ity” leading to epistemic behaviors (e.g., searching for lost keys under a streetlamp) [42].
When context-dependent control is considered, the neighborhood of the NESS resolves
into a network of local minima corresponding to ﬁxed perception-action loops separated
by energetic barriers that the control system must overcome to switch between loops. For
example, in a cell, this energetic barrier comprises the energy required to activate one path-
way while de-activating another, which may include the energetic costs of phosphorylation,
other chemical modiﬁcations, additional gene expression, etc. Diﬀerent pairs of pathways
can be expected to be separated by energetic barriers of diﬀerent heights, generating a
topographically-complex free energy landscape that coarse-grains, in a long-time average,
to the neighborhood of the NESS, i.e., to the maintenance of allostasis [68, 69, 82].
As noted earlier, we can think of controllable perception-action loops as nodes on a factor
graph, with the edges corresponding to pathways for control ﬂow, and the transition prob-
abilities labeling the edges as inversely proportional to the energetic barrier between loops.
This allows representing the GM for meta-level control (i.e., hierarchical) as a message-
8

passing system as described in [47]. The presence of very high energetic barriers can render
such a GM eﬀectively one-way, as seen in the context-dependent switches between signal
transduction pathways and GRNs that characterize cellular diﬀerentiation during morpho-
genesis. Biological examples of these include modiﬁcations of bioelectric pattern memories
in planaria, which can create alternative-species head shapes that eventually remodel back
to normal [83], or produce 2-headed worms which are permanent, and regenerate as 2-
headed in perpetuity [84].
2.2
The QRF picture
Cellular information processing has traditionally been treated as completely classical, i.e.,
as implemented by causal networks of macromolecules, each of which undergoes classical
state transitions via local dynamical processes that are conditionally independent of the
states of other parts of the network. While the “quantum” nature of proteins and other
macromolecules is broadly acknowledged, the scale at which quantum eﬀects are important
remains controversial, with straightforward single-molecule decoherence models predicting
decoherence times of attoseconds (10−18 s) or less [85, 86]: several orders of magnitude
below the timescales of processes involved in molecular information processing [87]. While
functional roles for quantum coherence in intramolecular information processing have been
demonstrated, intermolecular coherence remains experimentally elusive [88, 89, 90, 91].
The free-energy budgets of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are, however, orders of
magnitude smaller than would be required to support fully-classical information processing
at the molecular scale, suggesting that cells employ quantum coherence as a computational
resource [92]. Indirect evidence of longer-range, tissue-scale coherence in brains has also
been reported [93]. Reformulating the FEP in quantum information-theoretic terms enables
it to describe situations in which long-range coherence, and hence quantum computation,
cannot be neglected.
Following the development in [12], we consider a bipartite decomposition U = AB of a
ﬁnite, isolated system U for which the interaction Hamiltonian HAB = HU −(HA + HB)
is suﬃciently weak over the time period of interest that the joint state U is separable (i.e.,
factors) as |U⟩= |A⟩|B⟩. In this case, we can choose orthogonal basis vectors |ik⟩so that:
HAB = βkKB Tk
N
X
i
αk
i M k
i ,
(2)
where KB denotes Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute temperature of the environment,
k = A or B, the M k
i are N mutually-orthogonal Hermitian operators with eigenvalues in
{−1, 1}, the αk
i ∈[0, 1] are such that PN
i αk
i = 1, and βk ≥ln 2 is an inverse measure of k’s
thermodynamic eﬃciency that depends on the internal dynamics Hk; see [56, 58, 94, 95] for
further motivation and details of this construction and [96] for a pedagogical review. This
description is purely topological, attributing no geometry to either U or B; hence it allows
9

the “embedding space” of perceived “objects” to be an observer-dependent construct. It
has several relevant consequences:
• We can regard A and B as separated, and determined by independent measures. They
are separated by – and interact via – a holographic screen B that can be represented,
without loss of generality, by an array of N non-interacting qubits, where N is the
dimension of HAB [94, 95].
• A and B can be regarded as exchanging ﬁnite N-bit strings, each of which encodes
one eigenvalue of HAB [94].
• A and B have free choice of basis for HAB, corresponding to free choice of local frames
at B, e.g., free choice, for each qubit qi on B, of the local z axis and hence the z-spin
operator sz that acts on qi [96].
• Choice of basis corresponds to choosing the zero-point of total energy) by each of A
and B. The systems A and B are, therefore, in general at informational, but not at
thermal equilibrium [12].
• As A and B must obtain from B or A, respectively, whatever thermodynamic free
energy is required, by Landauer’s principle [73, 99, 100], to fund the encoding of
classical bits on B (as well as any other irreversible classical computation), A and B
must each devote some sector F of B to free-energy acquisition. The bits in F are
“burned as fuel” and so do not contribute input data to computations. Waste-heat
dissipation by one system is free energy acquisition by the other. The free-energy
sectors FA and FB of A and B need not align as subsets of qubits on B; that is,
qubits that A regards as free-energy sources may be regarded by B as informative
outputs and vice-versa [56, 58].
• The actions of the internal dynamics HA and HB on B can be represented by A-
and B-speciﬁc sets of QRFs, each of which both “measures” and “prepares” qubits
on B.
Each QRF acts on the qubits in some speciﬁc sector of B, breaking the
permutation symmetry of Eq. (2) [56, 58, 59]. Only QRFs acting on sectors other
than F implement informative computations; we will therefore restrict attention to
these QRFs.
• Each “computational” QRF can, without loss of generality, be represented by a cone-
cocone diagram (CCCD) comprising Barwise-Seligman classiﬁers and infomorphisms
between them [54, 55].
The apex of each such CCCD is, by deﬁnition, both the
category-theoretic limit and colimit of the “input/output” classiﬁers that correspond,
formally, to the operators M k
i in Eq. (2) [56, 58, 59].

incorporating sets of classiﬁers {Aα} and (logic) infomorphisms {fi, gjk} [54, Ch 12] over
suitable index ranges. As a memory-write system, Diagram (3) depicts a generic a blueprint
for a bow-tie or variational autoencoder (VAE) network amenable to describing a hierar-
chical Bayesian network with belief-updating as discussed in e.g. [12, 57, 59]. Crucially, it
is the non-commutativity of CCCDs of this form that speciﬁes intrinsic or quantum con-
textuality, as occurs, for instance, when the colimit core C′ is undeﬁnable [57, §7, §8] [59,
§7.2]. Consequences of such contextualityare discussed via examples in §5.
The holographic screen B functions as an MB separating A from B. It can be regarded
as having an N-dimensional, N-qubit Hilbert space Hqi = Q
i qi. While Hqi is strictly
ancillary to HU = HA ⊗HB, the classical situation can be recovered in the limit in which
the entanglement entropies S(|A⟩), S(|B⟩) →0 by considering the products HA ⊗Hqi and
HB ⊗Hqi to be “particle” state spaces for A and B, respectively. In this classical limit, the
states of Hqi become the blanket states of an MB that functions as a classical information
channel [94, 95, 96]. In quantum holographic coding, for example, B is often represented
by a polygonal tessellation of the hyperbolic disc, with qubits represented by polygonal
centroids. A speciﬁc TN model of a pentagon code is developed in [97]; see in particular
their Fig. 4. The geometric description of B as implementing holographic coding, and its
classical limit as an MB structured as a direct acyclic graph (DAG), is further explored in
the setting of TQNNs in [98].
In this quantum-theoretic picture, “systems” or “objects” observed and manipulated by
A or B correspond to sectors on B that are the domains of particular QRFs deployed
by A or B, respectively [58, 12, 59]. To simplify notation, we use the same symbol, e.g.,
‘Q’ to denote both a QRF Q and the sector dom(Q) on B. Any identiﬁable system X
factors into a “reference” component R that maintains a time-invariant state |R⟩or more
generally, state density ρR, that allows re-identiﬁcation and hence sequential measurements
over extended time, and a “pointer” component P with a time-varying state |P⟩or density
ρP. It is this pointer component, named for the pointer of an analog instrument, which
is the “state of interest” for measurements. The QRFs R and P clearly must commute,
and the sectors R and P clearly must be mutually decoherent [58, 12, 59]. All “system”
sectors must be components of some overall sector E that corresponds to the “observable
environment.”
The recording of measurement outcomes to a classical memory and the
reading of previously-recorded outcomes from memory can similarly be represented by a
QRF Y . As dom(Y ) is a sector on B, recorded memories of A are exposed to and hence
11

subject to modiﬁcation by B and vice-versa. Both the observable environment E and the
memory sector Y must be disjoint from, and decoherent with, the free-energy sector F.
As actions on B encode classical data, they have an associated free energy cost of at least
ln2 KBT per bit [73, 99, 100] that must originate from the source at F.
Time-energy
complementary associates a minimum time of h/[ln2(KBT)], with h being the Planck’s
constant, to this energy expenditure. We can, therefore, associate actions on B, including
memory writes, with “ticks” of an internal time QRF, which we denote tA and tB for A
and B, respectively. Assuming all observational outcomes are written to memory, we can
represent the situation as in Fig. 1. The time QRF is eﬀectively an outgoing bit counter
that can be represented by a groupoid operator Gij : ti →tj [56]. As outgoing bits are
oriented in opposite directions with respect to B for A and B, the time “arrows” tA and
tB point in opposite directions. Hence A and B can both be regarded as “interacting with
their own futures” as discussed in [96].
Figure 1: Cartoon illustration of QRFs required to observe and write a readable memory
of an environmental state |E⟩. The QRFs E and Y read the state from E and write it to
the memory Y respectively. Any identiﬁed system S must be part of E. The clock Gij is a
time QRF that deﬁnes the time coordinate tA. The dashed arrow indicates the observer’s
thermodynamic process that converts free energy obtained from the unobserved sector F
of B to waste heat exhausted through F. Adapted from [58], CC-BY license.
Measurements of a system X can be considered sequential if: 1) they separated in time
according to the internal time QRF, and 2) their outcomes are recorded to memory to enable
comparability across time. We show in [59] that sequential measurements can always be
12

represented by one of two schemata. Using the compact notation:
S
(4)
to represent a QRF S, we can represent measurements of a physical situation in which one
system divides into two, possibly entangled, systems with a diagram of the form:
S
S1
S2
(5)
Parametric down-conversion of a photon exempliﬁes this kind of process.
The reverse
process can be added to yield:
S
S1
S2
S
S
(6)
In the second type of sequential measurement process, the pointer-state QRF P is replaced
with an alternative QRF Q with which it does not commute. Sequences in which position
and momentum, sz and sx are measured alternately are examples. These can be represented
by the diagram
S
P
R
S
S
Q
R
S
(7)
As both P and Q must commute with R, the commutativity requirements for S are satisﬁed.
The sequences of operations depicted in Diagrams (6) and (7) clearly raise the questions
of how control is implemented, and of how the context changes that drive control ﬂow are
detected. Before turning to these questions in §3, we review a path-integral representation of
QRFs, show that the same representation captures the behavior of any system X identiﬁed
by a QRF, and discuss the questions of multiple observers and quantum contextuality.

2.3
The TQFT picture
As a least-action principle, the FEP is fundamentally a statement about the paths followed
by the joint system U through its state space. The classical FEP is amenable to a path-
integral formulation [13] that expresses the expected value of any observable (functional)
Ω[x(t)] of paths x(t) through the relevant state space as ([101], Eq. 6):
⟨Ω[x(t)]⟩=
Z
dx0
Z
d[x(t)]Ω[x(t)]p(x(t)|x0)p0(x0)
(8)
where x0 is the initial state and p(x(t)|x0) is the conditional probability of the path x(t).
Quantum theory generalizes this expression by, eﬀectively. replacing Ω[x(t)] with an au-
tomorphism on the relevant Hilbert space and p(x(t)|x0) with an amplitude for x(t) given
the initial state x0. For some ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space H, the manifold of all such
automorphisms is a cobordism on H, which is by deﬁnition a TQFT on H [102].
We show in [59] that any sequential measurement of any sector X of B induces a TQFT on
X, considered as a projection of the N-dimensional boundary Hilbert space Hqi associated
with B. In particular, measurement sequences of the form of Diagram (6) can be mapped
to cobordisms, i.e., to manifolds of maps between two designated boundaries, of the form:
B
S
B
S
S1
S2
S
S1
S2
F(i)
F(k)
F
(9)
14

while sequences of the form of Diagram (7) can be mapped to cobordisms of the form:
B
P
R
B
S
Q
R
P
R
S
Q
R
F(i)
F(k)
F
(10)
In either case, F : CCCD →Cob is the functor from the category CCCD of CCCDs (and
hence of QRFs) to the category of Cob ﬁnite cobordisms required to deﬁne a TQFT. In
general, we can state:
Theorem 1 ([59] Thm. 1). For any morphism F of CCCDs in CCCD, there is a cobor-
dism S such that a diagram of the form of Diagram (9) or (10) commutes.
referring to [59] for the proof.
Theorem 1 applies to any sequential measurement; therefore, it applies to measurements
of a sector X followed by measurements of the associated memory sector Y , or vice versa.
Assuming for convenience dim(X) = dim(Y ), we can consider a composite operation Q =
(−→
Q, ←−
Q), where −→
Q = QXQY and ←−
Q = QY QX, is then a pair of QRF sequences that can
be identiﬁed with TQFTs that measure and record an outcome, mapping HX →HY ,
and dually use an outcome read from memory to prepare a state, mapping HY →HX,
15

respectively as in Diagram 11:
B
Q
(11)
This composite operator Q is, by Theorem 1, a TQFT [98]. Hence the operation of recording
observational outcomes for a sector X made at t to memory, and then comparing them to
later observations at t + ∆t, is formally equivalent to propagating the “system” X forward
in time from t to t + ∆t.
Identifying QRFs as “internal” TQFTs allows a general analysis of information exchange
between multiple QRFs deployed by a single system, e.g., A. Because all QRFs act on
B, information exchange between QRFs requires a channel that traverses B. Any such
channel is itself a QRF, one deployed by B. Considering A to comprise two observers,
one deploying Q1 and the other deploying Q2, that interact via a local operations, classical
communication (LOCC [103]) protocol provides an example:
B
A
B
Q1
Q2
Classical channel
Quantum channel
(12)
In a LOCC protocol, one channel is considered “classical” while the other is considered
“quantum”; however, this language masks the fact that both channels are physical. As
pointed out in [104], all media supporting classical communication are physical, and inter-
actions with these media are always local measurements or preparations. Hence the two
channels in a LOCC protocol are physically equivalent – both are TQFTs implemented by
B – although their conventional semantics are diﬀerent.
16

Diagram (12) can, clearly also represent externally-mediated communication between any
two functional components of a system, e.g., macromolecular pathways within a cell or
functional networks within a brain. We show in [98] that whenever Q1 and Q2 are deployed
by distinct – technically, separable or mutually decoherent – “observers” or “systems,” they
fail to commute, i.e., the commutator [Q1, Q2] = Q1Q2 −Q2Q1 ≥h/2, where again h is
Planck’s constant. As shown in [57], Theorem 3.4 using the CCCD representation, non-
commutativity of QRFs induces quantum contextuality, i.e., dependence of measurement
results on “non-local hidden variables” that characterize the measurement context [105,
106, 107]. In the current context, such hidden variables characterize the action of HB on
B, aﬀecting what A will observe next in every cycle of A-B interaction.
As shown in [63], such context dependence can, in principle, be captured classically if
suﬃcient measurements of the context can be implemented. Such measurements would,
however, have to access all of B. The existence of an MB prevents such access; in the
current setting, A has access to B only via B. The ﬁnite energetic cost of measurement,
and consequent requirement for a thermodynamic sector F, prevents measurement even of
all of B by any ﬁnite physical system. Hence, we can expect physical systems, including
all biological systems, to employ only local context-dependent control to switch between
mutually non-commuting (sets of) QRFs.
How context switches implemented by QRF
switches induce evolution, development and learning was introduced in [22]. Some speciﬁc
of context switching will be discussed §5.

Tensor network representation of control ﬂow
3.1
Tensor networks and holographic duality
Entanglement and quantum error correction, two concepts developed in quantum informa-
tion theory, have been proved to have a fundamental role in unveiling quantum gravity
[108]. At the origin of this consideration there has been the discovery by Bekenstein and
Hawking [109, 110, 111, 112] that the second law of thermodynamics can be preserved in the
gravitational ﬁeld of a black hole, if this latter has an entropy proportional to the area of its
horizon, by the inverse of the Newton gravitational constant G. This entropy is maximal,
as implied by the second law itself, providing an upper bound for possible conﬁgurations of
matter within a region of the same size [113, 114].
Nonetheless, the scaling of the local degrees of freedom counted by the entropy does not
increase as the volume, hinging toward the formulation of the holographic conjecture [115],
suggesting a division between the information that can only be retrieved on the boundary
world, and a merely apparent bulk world. AdS/CFT realized the holographic conjecture,
postulating a duality between gravity in asymptotically AdS space and quantum ﬁeld theory
on the spatial inﬁnity of the AdS space [116]. Giving literal meaning to the duality, Ryu
and Takayanagi (RT) proposed that entanglement of a boundary region fulﬁls the same law
17

as for the black hole entropy, replacing the area of the black hole horizon with an extremal
surface area that bounds the bulk region under scrutiny.
While on the boundaries the theory can be individuated assigning a speciﬁc conformal
ﬁeld theory (CFT), in the bulk the geometry can be associated to speciﬁc entanglement
structures of the quantum systems. This is for instance what happens to the ground states
of a CFT associated to an AdS space: the RT area surface increases less fast than the
volume of the boundary. When the boundary is at equilibrium, in a thermal state of ﬁnite
temperature, the bulk geometry corresponds to that of a black hole, its horizon being
parallel to the boundary and its size increasing with the temperature. The RT surface is
then conﬁned between the boundary and the back hole horizon, approaching the boundary
at higher temperature and increasing its entropy. These considerations suggest the existence
of a subtle link interconnecting the structure of space-time and quantum entanglement, and
hence that a theory of quantum gravity must be fundamentally holographic, where its states
satisfy the RT formula for some bulk geometry.
The existence of an exact correspondence between bulk gravity and quantum theory at the
boundary may hinge toward possible inconsistencies with locality. This has been discussed
in the literature, in terms of local reconstruction theory [117, 118, 119]: variables in the
bulk (e.g. bulk spins) can be controlled instantaneously from the boundary, but requiring
simultaneous access to a large portion of the boundary: locality and upper speed of light do
not hold exactly in this theory. Nonetheless, local observers conﬁned in small regions at the
boundary still fulﬁl locality and the existence of an upper limit of the speed of information
exchange, in a way that is reminiscent of quantum error correction code (QECC) in quantum
information theory: information is stored redundantly, in such a way that when part of
it is corrupted, a reconstruction of information is still possible. Locality in the bulk is
therefore a QECC property of the encoding map that realizes the duality between bulk and
boundary. On the other hand, these properties are strictly connected to RT, which provides
the necessary resource of entanglement for QEEC to emerge.
The RT formula and QECC are properties fulﬁlled by diﬀerent classes of models, among
which TNs [120]. These have been ﬁrst introduced in condensed matter physics as varia-
tional wave-functions of strongly correlated systems [121, 122]. TNs are many-body wave-
functions that can be derived composing few-body quantum states, which are indeed ten-
sors. A prototype of TN is e.g. the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled pairs of
qubits: in an entangled basis, measured qbits are in some entangled pure state and can be
composed with remaining ones with increasing complexity: complicated quantum entan-
glement can be derived by only entangling a few qubits [123].
Particularly relevant for its implications on the reconstruction of the space-time structure
is the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) [124]. TNs can be nat-
urally related to holography duality by considering that their entanglement entropy can
be controlled by their graph geometry. Some versions of TNs that are characterized by
RT entanglement entropy and QEEC have been constructed resorting to stabilizer codes
[125, 126] and random tensors with large bond dimension [127]. TNs with random tensors
at each node can be regarded as random states restricted by the topology of the network.
18

Exactly as random states are almost maximally entangled, random TNs show through the
RT formula an almost maximal entanglement, providing a large family of states with in-
teresting properties to explore holographic duality. Furthermore, for random TNs the RT
formula holds in generic spaces with not necessarily hyperbolic geometry, hinging toward
an extension of holographic duality beyond AdS, to more general conﬁgurations in quan-
tum gravity. Nonetheless, at least in three dimensions, random tensor networks have been
related to the gravitational action, by means of the Regge calculus [128].
On the other hand, since geometry emerges as a speciﬁcation of the entanglement structure,
one may consider that the Einstein equations should be connected as well to the dynamics
of entanglement. For small perturbations around the ground state of a CFT in boundary,
linearized Einstein equations have been derived from the RT formula [129, 130]. Indeed,
the conformal symmetry enables a relations between the energy momentum and the entan-
glement entropy, and consequently the area of the extremal surface c an be connected to
the energy-momentum distribution at the boundary — this is equivalent to the linearized
Einstein equations.
The dynamics on the boundary, on the other side, shows a chaotic behaviour, with scram-
bling of the single-particle operators, which evolve into multi-particle operators [131]. Max-
imal chaotic behaviour recovered in the ladder operators commutator growth, is encoded in
the out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) functions, characterized by exponential growth
in time and temperature. A model endowed with this properties is e.g. the Sachdev-Ye-
Kitaev model, developed to describe certain systems in condensed matter physics, such as
Gapless spin-ﬂuid [132, 133, 134]. On the other hand, operator scrambling is also related
to QEEC: the chaotic dynamics at the boundary instantiates QECC preserving quantum
information, eﬃciently hidden (and protected) behind the horizon. Nevertheless this has
led to may questions, concerning the information behind the horizon being eventually ac-
cessible from the boundary though non-local measurements, the fate of the local degrees of
freedom hitting the singularity, the relation among the causal structure of the bulk and a
smooth geometry across the horizon.
3.2
General results
We can move to prove a general result:
Theorem 2. A system A exhibits non-trivial control ﬂow if, and only if, its control ﬂow
can be represented by a TN.
and examine some of its corollaries. We begin by deﬁning:
Deﬁnition 1. Control ﬂow is trivial if a system deploys only one QRF.
As any collection of mutually-commuting QRFs can be represented as a single QRF [57, 59],
any system that deploys only mutually-commuting QRFs exhibits trivial control ﬂow.
19

Systems that deploy only a single QRF “do the same thing” regardless of context, and so
do not qualify as “interesting” in the sense used here. As noted above, no ﬁnite physical
system can measure the entire state of its boundary with a single QRF, so no such system
can simultaneously measure and act on its entire context.
Any system A that deploys
multiple QRFs in sequence cannot, as noted above, avoid contextuality due to unobservable
eﬀects, mediated by the action of HB, of the action of Qi on the state measured by Qj.
Every action taken by an “interesting” system, in other words, at least transiently increases
the VFE at its boundary.
Consider, then, a system A that deploys multiple, distinct QRFs Q1, Q2, . . . Qn, where
n ≪N = dim(HAB). Classical control ﬂow in A can then be represented by a matrix
CF = [Pij], where Pij is the probability of the control transition Qi →Qj. As noted
earlier, any such transition has an energetic cost, which must be paid with free energy
sources from F.
The matrix CF is a 2-tensor. Theorem 2 states that this tensor can be decomposed into a
TN. We prove it as follows:
Proof (Thm. 2). Suppose ﬁrst that control ﬂow in a system A can be represented by a
TN. A TN is, by deﬁnition, a factorization of a tensor operator into a network of tensor
operators. This network can be either hierarchical or ﬂat; if it is hierarchical, each layer
can be considered a ﬂat TN. Hence no generality is lost in considering just the case of
a ﬂat TN, which is an operator contraction T = . . . TijTjkTkl . . . , where summation on
shared indices is left implicit. In general, Tjk ̸= T T
jk = Tkj, hence these expressions do not
commute. They therefore represent non-trivial control ﬂow. Conversely, any non-trivial
control ﬂow can be written, at any ﬁxed scale or level of abstraction, as a linear sequence
of (in general probabilistic) operators. The ﬁxed order of operators in the sequence can be
encoded formally by adding “spatial” indices as needed to allow contraction over shared
indices. Hence any non-trivial control ﬂow at a ﬁxed scale can be written as a ﬂat TN.
This construction can be repeated at each larger scale to produce a hierarchical TN over a
collection of “lowest-scale” TNs.
We can now examine two corollaries of this result:
Corollary 1. Decoherent reference sectors exist on B if and only if control ﬂow can be
implemented by a TN.
Proof. Decoherence sectors require independently-deployable, non-commuting QRFs. This
requires a control structure that factors, by Theorem 2 a TN. Conversely, a TN factors
the control structure, making QRFs independently deployable, which renders their sectors
decoherent.
Equivalently, the GM factors if, and only if, control ﬂow can be implemented by a TN.
Corollary 2. The TN of any system compliant with the FEP is a decomposition of the
Identity.
20

Proof. The FEP applies to systems with a NESS, and drives such systems to return to (the
vicinity of) the NESS after any perturbation. Hence at a suﬃciently large scale, the TN of
any such system is a cycle, i.e., a decomposition of the Identity.
Many standard TN models, e.g., MERAs, assume boundary conditions asymptotically far,
in numbers of lowest-scale operators, from the region of the network that is of interest.
Identifying such asymptotic boundary conditions yields a cyclic system.
Theorem 2, together with its corollaries, provides a natural, formal means of classifying
systems by their control architectures.
At a high level, two characteristics distinguish
systems with diﬀerent architectures:
• Hierarchical depth indicates the number of “virtual machine” layers [135] the ar-
chitecture supports. The interfaces between these layers implement coarse-graining,
removing from the higher-level representation all dimensions, and hence all informa-
tion, which is contracted out of the lower-level operators.
• Number and location of contractions that yield unitary operators, and hence build in
entanglement between lower-level operators. The natural limit is a MERA, in which
every pair of lower-level operators is entangled at every hierarchical level [48].
The control-ﬂow architecture, in turn, speciﬁes the structure of the “layout” of distinguish-
able sectors on B and hence of detectable features/objects in the environment. Locality on
B requires a hierarchical TN; detectable entanglement requires a MERA-like TN. Locality
is required for detectable features/objects to appear to have components with nested de-
composition. Any QRF for geometric space, and hence for spacetime, must be hierarchical,
and must be a MERA if entanglement in space is to be detected. A MERA is required, in
particular, if the use of coherence between spatially-separated systems as a computational
or communication resource is detectable.
To illustrate the classiﬁcation of systems by hierarchical level, consider the ten-step cyclic
TN shown in Diagram (13):
. . .
A

J
(13)
and its extension to a hierarchy as shown in Diagram (14):

21

where red, blue, and green colors indicate distinct hierarchical “layers” of tensor contrac-
tions.
We have trained artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) to execute these TNs as the
sequences of state transitions shown in Table 1. The ﬁrst sequence (Dataset 1) is a ten-step
cycle shown Diagram (13); the second sequence (Dataset 2) layers the coarse-grained state
transitions of Diagram (14) onto this ten-step cycle. In Dataset 2, a two-bit tag is used to
diﬀerentiate the “low-level” from the coarse-grained “high-level” cycles. An example state
state transition from a randomly-generated initial state is shown in Fig. 2; the red-on-green
bit pattern eﬀectively moves “up” one step on each state-transition cycle.
Table 1: Datasets used in ANN simulations. Dataset 1 speciﬁes a ten-step cycle

coarse-grained cycles layered on top.
The tags (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1)
distinguish the data for the low- and high-level cycles.
Figure 2: Example state transition from Dataset 1.
22

We trained two ANNs, one to execute each of the control cycles shown in Table 1. The
networks are each composed of three layers, as illustrated in Fig. 3, with network sizes of
[10, 50, 10] and [10, 200, 10], respectively, for the input, hidden, and output layers. The
units in the hidden layer use the rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) nonlinear activation function
and the neurons in the output layer use the hyperbolic tangent activation function. The
network is connected in a feedforward way where a neuron in one layer connects to every
neuron in the next layer. Since the ANN serves as a switch state controller, we use a training
scheme, similar to one-class classiﬁcation [136], where the training data are the only data
that the network learns to produce. In so doing, the network learns to overﬁt the training
data, and any input outside of the designated state-encoding is discarded. The network
is, therefore, not expected to deviate from the learned pattern. The network learns both
control regimes wth 100% accuracy after training with 3,000 randomly-generated 10-bit
inputs.
Figure 3: Feed-forward network archtecture used to learn the control cycles speciﬁed in
Table 1. Each node is connected to every node of the next layer, as shown here for the ﬁrst
and last nodes only. The labels ‘T’ and ‘T+1’ indicate time steps in the executed control
ﬂow.
In the more realistic case of noisy input data, where binary states can be ﬂipped, the
23

Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM), a minimal two-layer nonlinear feedback network
[137], is a viable alternative to a shallow feed-forward ANN. The architecure is shown in
Fig. 4. This BAM network learns to associate between the two initial and ﬁnal states in
Table 1, with similar performance to that of the feed-forward network.

here. As in Fig. 3, only the connections of the ﬁrst and last nodes are shown explicitly.

Implementing control ﬂow with TQNNs
Tensor Networks can be naturally associated to the matrix elements of physical scalar
products among topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs). Physical scalar products
encode indeed the dynamics of TQFTs, since they fulﬁll their constraints of imposing
ﬂatness of the curvature and gauge invariance. Thus, the matrix elements associated to
scalar products can be seen as evolution matrix elements for the spin-network states that
span the Hilbert spaces of TQNNs.
24

4.1
Tensor networks as classiﬁers for TQNNs
A notable example is provided by BF theories [138], a class of TQFTs particularly well
studied in the literature of mathematical physics that enables expressing eﬀective theories
of particle physics, gravity and condensed matter, and provides as well a general frame-
work for implementations of models of quantum information and quantum computation,
machine learning (ML) and neuroscience. These are deﬁned on the principal bundle M of
a connection A for some internal gauge group G, with algebra g, according to the action
on a d-dimensional manifold Md
S =
Z
Md
Tr[B ∧F] ,
(15)
where B is an ad(g)-valued d-2-form, F denotes the ﬁeld-strength of A, which is a 2-form,
and the trace Tr is over the internal indices of g, ensuring gauge invariance of the density
Lagrangian L = Tr[B ∧F] of the BF theory.
Variation with respect to the conjugated variables, the connection A and the B frame-ﬁeld,
closing a canonical symplectic structure, provide the equations of motion of the theory
[138]:
F = 0 ,
dAB = 0 ,
(16)
respectively the curvature constraint, imposing the ﬂatness of the connection, and the Gauß
constraint, imposing invariance under gauge transformations, having denoted with dA the
covariant derivative with respect to the connection A.
At the quantum level, the states of the kinematical Hilbert space of the theory, fulﬁlling
by construction the Gauß constraint, can be represented in terms of cylindrical functionals
Cyl, supported on graphs Γ that are unions of segments γi, the end points of which meet
in nodes n, and with holonomies – elements of the group G – Hγi[A] of the connection A
assigned to γi and intertwiner operators – invariant tensor product of representations – vn
assigned to the nodes n.
For G = SU(2), spin-networks |Γ, jγ, ιn⟩, supported on Γ and labelled by the spin jγ of
the irreducible representations of the group elements assigned to γ and by the quantum
intertwiner numbers ιn associated to vn, represent a basis of the kinematical Hilbert space
of the theory. In terms of functionals of Cyl, one can provide the holonomy representation,
which is related to the “spin and intertwiner” representation of |Γ, jγ, ιn⟩by means of the
Peter-Weyl transform. This allows us to decompose the spin-network cylindric functional
as [139]:
Ψjγij ,ιni(hγij) =
 O
n
ιn
!
·

O
γij
D(jγij )(hγij)

,
(17)
with D(j) are Wigner matrices providing representation matrices of the SU(2) group ele-
ments.
25

The functorial evolution among spin-networks is ensured by the projector operator [140],
which implements the curvature constraint in the physical scalar product among states, i.e.
⟨in|P |out⟩,
with
P =
Z
D[N] exp(ı
Z
Tr[NF]) .
(18)
We may then regard |in⟩as elements of the Hilbert space, and without loss of generality pick
up those ones resulting from composing tensorially in Cyl k-representations of holonomies.
We may further denote them as |j1 . . . jk⟩, with some ordering prescription to associate
the topological structure of Γ to the sequence of spin labels. Physically evolving states
P|in⟩are distinguished from the former ones by labelling them as | ^
j1 · · · jk⟩. Similarly, we
introduce |out⟩as the tensor product of (n-k)-representations of holonomies, and denote
these states as |i1 . . . in−k⟩. Then the matrix elements of ⟨in|P |out⟩naturally give rise [98]
to an n-tensor, i.e.
⟨i1 . . . in−k| ^
j1 · · · jk⟩= Ti1...in−kj1...jk .
(19)
4.2
Geometric RG ﬂow for TQNNs and TNs
The mathematical structures of TQNNs we summarized in Sec. 4.1 are picturing systems “at
equilibrium”, for which TQFTs characterize a topological stability that percolates into the
related transition amplitudes. Nonetheless, it is worth considering as well how stochastic
noise might interfere with the topological order ensured by TQFTs, and study the role of
“out-of-equilibrium” physics in the analysis of the evolution of the systems under scrutiny.
Out-of-equilibrium dynamics is instantiated considering a heat-ﬂow evolution of the funda-
mental ﬁelds of the theory, with respect to a thermal time τ. Typical Langevin equations,
complemented with stochastic noise, provide through their convergence toward the equa-
tions of motion of the theory the relaxation toward equilibrium of the ﬁeld conﬁgurations
representing speciﬁc systems [141]. In general, given some ﬁelds φσ, with a classical equa-
tion of motion derived, according to the variational principle δS/δφσ, from an action S over
a Euclidean manifold M, the associated Langevin equations read:
∂
∂τ φσ = −δS
δφσ
+ ησ ,
(20)
with ησ a stochastic noise term. The theory at equilibrium is characterized by the symme-
tries of the equations of motion δS/δφσ = 0 that are broken in the transient phase [142];
these symmetries are consistent with – and in the case of BF theories, actually generated
by – the theories at equilibrium.
A prototype of geometric heat-ﬂow was introduced by Hamilton, and then used by Perelman
to prove the Poincar´e conjecture, which goes under the name of Ricci ﬂow.
Here the
gravitational ﬁeld gµν is the basic conﬁgurational space ﬁeld, while the drift terms are the
Einstein equations of motion in the vacuum, which indeed are expressed by requiring that
26

the components of the Ricci tensor vanish, i.e. Rµν = 0. The Ricci ﬂow then reads
ı ∂
∂τ gµν = −2Rµν ,
(21)
having considered now a Lorentzian manifold M. The Ricci ﬂow equations can be further
complemented introducing the Ricci target RT
µν = κ2(Tµν −1/2gµνT), expressed in terms
of the Newton constant G = κ2/(8π) and the energy-momentum tensor of matter Tµν, so
as to obtain at equilibrium the Einstein equations:
Rµν −1
2gµνR = κ2Tµν ,
or equivalently
Rµν = RT
µν .
(22)
The stochastic version of the Ricci ﬂow, with heat equation turning into a Langevin equa-
tion, has been introduced and deepened in [142] for a generic gravitational system in the
presence of matter ﬁelds, describing an action S for gravity and matter. Moving then from:
ı ∂
∂τ gµν = −1
κ2
δS
δgµν + η gµν ,
(23)
in which a multiplicative noise ηµν = η gµν appears, the Hamiltonian analysis of the stochas-
tic Ricci ﬂow (SRF) in the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) variables has been
derived [142].
An essential by-product of the discussion, from the Ricci ﬂow perspective, is that the
equilibration trajectories corresponds to those of a renormalization group (RG) ﬂow. The
thermal time τ plays the role of scale parameter that individuates a dimension in the
bulk, which is out-of-equilibrium. The boundaries are recovered asymptotically in τ, in the
infra-red regime, and are by deﬁnition at equilibrium and thus symmetric.
For a particular class of TQFTs, the BF theories we have introduced in Sec. 4.1 for im-
plementing TQNNs and TNs, the geometric RG ﬂow acquire a speciﬁc expression as the
TQFT equivalent of the gravitational Ricci ﬂow [143].

TNs as a generalization of the main model architectures in
ML
The use of TNs is an emerging topic in the ML community. The integration between the
two appears quite immediate. A TN structure can be viewed as an ML model in which
the parameters are properly adjusted to learn the classiﬁcation of a data set.
Yet, as
Ref. [144] mentions, machine learning can aid, in turn, in determining a factorization of
a TN approximating a data set. Moreover, TNs are also used to compress the layers of
ANN architectures, besides a variety of other uses. Tensor networks are becoming more and
more popular to the extent that they are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating
high-dimensional data, as in the case of image and video classiﬁcation tasks in which the
data is represented as a high-dimensional tensor. High eﬃciency, ﬂexibility, and easy to
27

use are making them a dominant choice for many AI applications. Furthermore, besides
being used to represent data, TNs can be used to process data by exploiting a number
of operators. This feature makes them an eﬀective technique for processing data in ML
applications.
As it is well known, TNs are particularly well suited for representing quantum many-body
states in which the dimension of the Hilbert space is exponentially large in the number of
particles. The corresponding ML approach consists in:
• Lifting data to exponentially higher spaces;
• Applying any linear classiﬁer f(x) = W ⋆Φ(X) to a non-linear space;
• Compressing the weights by using TNs.
The output of the model is a separation of classes that would not be linearly separable in
a linear space. In particular, the decision function is the overlap of the weight tensor W
with the feature map tensor Φ as in Fig. 5. The weight tensor W can be approximated by
the decomposition in Fig. 6.
Figure 5: Representation of the decision function (see [145]).
Figure 6: Matrix product decomposition (again see [145]).
Regularization and optimization are built as a constructive product of low-order tensors
while weight compression is performed by using the Matrix Product States (MPS) de-
composition.
If we look at Deep Neural Networks as a piecewise composition of linear
28

discriminators (logistic regression functions), then the TN framework appears as a gener-
alization of the main model architectures found in the ML literature, e.g. Support Vector
Machines, Kernel models, and Deep Neural Networks.
The literature concerning the use of tensor theory in traditional ML is becoming large. A
short review starts with a seminal paper by Stoudenmire and Schwab [146], which demon-
strated how algorithms for optimizing TNs can be adapted to supervised learning tasks
by using MPS (tensor trains) to parametrize non-linear kernel learning models. Novikov,
Troﬁmov, and Oseledets [147] have shown how an exponentially large tensor of parameters
can be represented in a factorized format called Tensor Train (TT), with the consequence
of obtaining a regularization of the model. van Glasser, Pancotti, and Cirac [148] explored
the connection between TNs and probabilistic graphical models by introducing the concept
of a “generalized tensor network architecture” for ML. Ref. [149] then designed a generative
model, i.e. a traditional machine learning model that learns joint probability distributions
from data and generates samples according to it, by using MPS. Ref. [150] made use of
autoregressive MPSs for building an unsupervised learning model that goes beyond proof-
of-concept by showing performance comparable to standard traditional models. Finally,
Ref. [151] analyzes the contribution of polynomials of diﬀerent degrees to the supervised
learning performance of diﬀerent architectures.

Implications for biological control systems
Scale-free biology requires a smooth transition from quantum-like to classical-like behavior.
Typical representations of metabolic, signal-transduction, and gene-regulatory pathways are
entirely classical, even though many of their steps involve electron-transfer or other mecha-
nisms that are acknowledged to require a quantum-theoretic description [87, 152]. As noted
earlier, free-energy budget considerations suggest that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
employ quantum coherence as a computational resource [92]. Emerging empirical evidence
for longer-range entanglement in mammalian brains suggests that large-scale networks may
also be using quantum coherence as a resource [93]. Control ﬂow models must, therefore,
support the possibility of quantum computation in biological systems. Hierarchical TNs
that include unitary components, e.g., MERA-type models, provide this capability.
In prokaryotes, the primary tasks of control ﬂow are adapting metabolism to available re-
sources via metabolite-driven gene regulation [153] and initiating DNA replication and
cell division when conditions are favorable.
We can, therefore, expect shallow hierar-
chies of eﬀectively classical control transitions in these organisms. Eukaryotes, however,
are characterized by both intracellular compartmentalization and morphological degrees
of freedom at the whole-cell scale. We have shown previously that the FEP will induce
“neuromorphic” morphologies – i.e. morphologies that segregate inputs from outputs and
enable a fan-in/fan-out computational architecture – in any systems with morphological
degrees of freedom [154]. Such systems can be expected to have deep control hierarchies
at the cellular level, with hierarchical structure correlating with morphological structure
29

in morphologically-complex cells such as neurons [155], and in multicellular assemblages at
all scales. As well as managing metabolism and replication, such systems must implement
active exploration of the environment, communication with other systems, and – crucially
for cognition – the writing and reading of stigmergic memories. Thus we can expect such
systems to implement QRFs for spacetime and for speciﬁc kinds of objects, e.g., conspeciﬁcs
and suitable substrates for recording stigmergic memories. Such QRFs rely on symmetries,
and hence on redundancy of encoded (or encodable) information; they depend, in other
words, on the availability of error-correcting codes [25, 156]. The implementation of space-
time as a quantum error-correcting code by TNs has been extensively studied by physicists;
see [157] for review and [98] for a detailed analysis using the present formalism. The use of
spacetime as an error-correcting code by organisms – e.g., the implementation of transla-
tional and rotational invariance of objects by dorsal visual processing in mammals [158, 159]
– is well-understood phenomenologically, but the details of neural implementation remain
to be elucidated.
Both the context-sensitivity of, and the occurence of context eﬀects due to non-commutativity
of QRFs in, control networks can be expected to increase with their complexity and hier-
archical depth. “Bowtie” networks with high fan-in/fan-out to/from multi-use proteins or
second messengers such as Ca2+ are increasingly recognized as ubiquitous in high eukary-
otic cells [160]. Such networks have the general for of the CCCD depicted in Diagram (3).
Frequently, such networks evolve via compression of information (e.g. toward share second
messengers, as in [Ca2+]-based interactions [161, 162]) as an eﬃciency-increasing mecha-
nism. Bowties introduce semantic ambiguities that must be resolved by context. Each
incoming signal has its own governing semantics, but the relevant context can depend on
boundary conditions which can be exceedingly diﬃcult (if not impossible) to predetermine
(see e.g., [163, 164] for general discussions of the history and semantic depth of this prob-
lem). As pointed out in [22], a context change x 7→y is semantically problematic if for a
ﬁxed set {oi} of observations, the conditional probability distributions P(oi|x) and P(oi|y)
are well deﬁned, but the joint distribution P(oi|x ∨y) is not [106]. This occurs whenever
the QRFs for x and y do not commute [57, Th 7.1]. As suggested by Diagram (3), this
context-switching problem aﬀects deep learning using VAEs [165]; see e.g., the application
to antimicrobial peptides in [166]. In general, the structure of Diagram (3) can serve as
a convenient benchmark for distinguishing signal transduction networks that incorporate
co-deployable versus non-co-deployable QRFs [57].
“Quantum” context eﬀects due to non-commutativity have, interestingly, been reported
even at the scale of human language use. The “Snow Queen” experiment [167] challenged
subjects with distinct, mutually-inconsistent meanings of terms such as ‘kind’, ‘evil’, or
‘beautiful’ in diﬀerent contexts, and detected statistically-signiﬁcant context eﬀects using
the CbD formalism [62, 63].
Such eﬀects cannot be explained by linguistic ambiguity,
misreading, etc. Such language-driven contextuality is taken up in the setting of psycholin-
guistics and distributional semantics in [168], which combines CbD and the sheaf theoretic
[60, 61] methods to systematically study semantic ambiguity as creating meaning/sense
discrepancies in statements like “It was about time”, “She had time on her hands to win
30

the heat”, “West led with a queen”, etc.
While the notion of “languages” has thus far been applied to cells, tissues, and even non-
vertebrates in a mostly metaphorical way, we can speculate that linguistic approaches to
understanding the interplay between context dependence and semantic ambiguity may be
useful to biology in general. Immune cells (e.g., T cells) are, for example, “programmed” or
“trained” by their progenitor cells to respond to local cellular signals and ambient conditions
in particular ways. Unexpected context changes may induce dysfunctional (at the organism
scale) responses, including chronic disorders [169]; these can be considered consequenes of
discrepancies between the “actual’ semantics of incoming signals and the semantics expected
by the immune systems’ “language.” This suggestion of possible “linguistic” contextuality
seems in consonance with the hypothesis of [170] that the immune system is a cognitive (liv-
ing) system implementing its exclusive system of language-grammar, which may be prone
to analogous disorders of communication as those discussed in [168]. Similar context eﬀects
have been observed in microbiological systems [171]; here discrepancies in experimentally
derived classical probabilities arising from lactose-glucose interference signaling in E. Coli
can only be explained in terms of non-classical probabilities. We note that the expression
‘quantum-like’ [172] is often used for such eﬀects; however, their formal structure is exactly
that given by quantum theory.
We expect that further research into quantum biology will unfold signiﬁcant perspectives
on human/mammalian physiology and cognitive capabilities along the lines suggested in
the present article. For example, allostatic maintenance, as brieﬂy alluded to in §2.1, can be
seen as a process regulating a body’s physiological conditions relative to costs and beneﬁts
while dynamically allocating resources for the purpose of overall adaptability of an organism
within its internal environment. Implementing the allostatic and anticipatory mechanisms
are the visceromotor cortical regions generating autonomic, hormonal, and immunological
predictions leading to interoceptive inference [68, 69, 70, 82, 173, 174, 176, 177].
This
process of inference in humans and mammals putatively utilizes predictive coding for the
processes of homeostasis-allostasis through a hierarchy of cellular to organ-level systems,
in turn connecting interoception to the processes of extercoception and proprioception
[82, 173, 177, 178, 179]. The basic principles follow from how allostasis provides protection
against potential surprise by utilizing a framework somewhat beyond the error signaling
necessary for homeostatic maintenance (it is essentially through minimizing the free energy
of internal state trajectories towards combatting surprise, as discussed in §2.1). The net
eﬀect of the process is consonant with the Good Regulator theorem of [175], showing how
regulation of a given system requires an internal model of that system. A further perspective
is to emphasize the predictive nature of an integrated, complex, allostatic-interoceptive
cortical system capable of supporting a spectrum of psychological phenomena including
memory and emotions [177] (cf. [82]). Accordingly, cognitive conditions such as depression
and autism have been described as abnormalities of allostatic-interoceptive inference, so
impairing predictive coding mechanisms due to aberrant assimilation and mistuning of
prediction errors (putatively a connectivity issue), conceivably leading to a root cause of
many known cognitive conditions [82, 173, 178].
31

We anticipate that this fully general, context sensitive model of control ﬂow will be im-
portant for understanding morphogenesis, which is not simply a feed-forward emergent
system, but rather a highly context-sensitive error-minimizing process [23]. Speciﬁcally,
the collective intelligence of cells during embryonic development, organ regeneration, and
metamorphosis can create and repair speciﬁc complex structures despite a wide range of
perturbations [180]. Changes in the genome, the number of cells, or the starting conﬁgura-
tion can often be overcome: bisected embryos result in normal twins, amputated salamander
limbs re-grow back to normal, and planarian fragments result in perfect little worms [181].
The competency of cellular collectives to reach the correct target morphology despite even
drastic interventions requires an understanding of how they navigate, via context-sensitive
control ﬂow, problem spaces including anatomical morphospace [182], physiological, and
transcriptional spaces [156, 183]. Understanding the navigation policies used by unconven-
tional collective intelligences can help not only understand creative problem-solving on rapid
timescales (such as the ability to regulate genes to accommodate an entirely novel stressor
[184] without evolutionary adaptation), but may also have implications for predicting and
managing the goals and behavioral repertoires of synthetic beings [185].

Conclusion
We have shown here how the problem of deﬁning control ﬂow arises in active inference
systems, and provided three formal representations of the problem. We have proved that
control ﬂow in such systems can always be represented by a tensor network, provided
illustrative examples, and shown how the general formalism of topological quantum neural
networks can be used to implement a general model of control ﬂow. These results provide
a general formalism with which to characterize context dependence in active inference
systems at any scale, from that of macromolecular pathways to that of multi-organism
communities. They suggest that the concept of communication by language is not just
metaphorical when applied to biological systems in general, but rather an appropriate and
productive description of interactional dynamics.
We view these results as a further step toward fully integrating the formal models, concepts,
and languages of physics, biology, and cognitive science. This integration is not reductive.
It rather allows us to classify systems using natural measures of organizational and com-
putational complexity, and to understand how interactions between simpler systems can
implement the more complex behavior of the larger systems that they compose.
