At that time there Mood upon a higHi,

who had borne him no oftapfing, and who

where he had epenl hit youlh, rumor 'aid, 
In a moat disreputable manner. One day 
there came to the chateau a youthful Min<

pataed from town to town, from ea*ile to

Uce of the Ilarone**, and with a trembling 
voice ahe demanded whence he cunt and 
from wham ha  bad  learned   that  halUd. 
" I come from Trove*,* waa the reply, 
■nd the ballad waa taught me by an igrd 
man with whom I dwelt, and who, when I 
wta luffloiently well ikitled in tha art of

Tha aeigneur of Monjardin, obterting 
that hia wtfe'i emotion wta becoming more 
and more vloihle ind intenae, ordered the 
tnimtrel to quit the chamber, but to await 
in the oaalta hia further ordera. Whan bo 
wa* gone the Baroneae exclaimed :— 
Thoee trorda! that air I methought 
they ware known but to myielf and. my fa- 
ther." 
'The minttrel i* without doubt a tpy,' 
•aid the ewauicfoue Baron, 'whote object it 
it to ditoovtr our abode and give informa- 
tion thereof to tome eneaaiea) but ha ahall 
oot return to glee intelligence to liioae who 
have aent him.' 
'Obi tlay him not,'at id tha Rtroaeea | 
add not tha murder of the innocent youlh 
to a liat of crimee alrcadyton long.' 
' Well, well, ao.wered the Baron, H thtll 
not deprira htm of life, hut it were dtnger- 
nua to give him hia liberty) I will confine 
him In one of the ehamben of the cattle. 
So taylng ha went forth to execute hit de- 
•ign, but ihe. Minneaeitger had dltappeared 
and could not be found. 
A frw dayt eltpted and the young min- 
atrrl again appeared at the rn-tle. He wt* 
taken by Ihe Baron to a at-eret chamber 
only to hlmielf, in a remote tower, 
far from the inhabiied ponion of the chat- 
eau. 
Sow,' tailed   the   Baron, 'tell me where- 
fore thou hatt come IO ihii caiile?   I know 
that  thou art here on tome tecrat er- 
rand, and if it be not revealed thy dayt are 
numbered.'

The oext day found.the brtee ■toetrel aa

priaoned, when aa aged man arrived at the 
chateau, fwwtann and weary, and having 
craved and obtained on audience of the 
Baron, demanded if he knew aught of a 
youthful tninttrel, who, he had beard, waa 
laat aeen at the cattle. 
'Thou doit not remember me,'continued 
the atranger. *1 am thy wlfe't father. Thou

thought, ma of a meana which ha* proved 
■ucce*aful; I knew a iweet ballad which my 
daughter had computed in her youth ; thta 
I taught to a boy, who, negb-cted from hi« 
infancy by hit own relative*, lived under my 
care. Htm I btde go forth and ting thi- 
lay in every loan and caalle until he thould 
find my daughter, and then >end me ititell - 
genee where ahe lived, that I might are her

The Baron staved io heir no more t be

none knew of the chamber but himeel f. 
For tome, time ihe disappearance of the 
Baron caused the greateat excitement ; but 
at length, while tome rrpairt were being ex- 
ecuted in the ntaaonry of the eaatle the 
workmen discovered the *eoret chamhei 
the half worm etlen yet atill recognizable 
corpses of the two brothers, and a written 
document conttining the confession of tha 
Baron.

should at once withdraw fmm the sport*.— 
Undoubtedly ihey were gratified while at the 
dinner when loaau were drank to our heroes 
and the President. 
On Thursday there wa* ■ similar enter-

a youth entered the li*t ai knight of the lost 
c*d*e, waving a retojl flag. In oonvaraaibn 
with an editor of one of ihe leading State 
journal*, which is a devoted admlniairnunn 
organ, he expressed his approbation of the 
gallsnt rebel, and heartily did honor to the 
•pirit of patriotism he manifested. Recast'

PtaatCLTtNo Tite FKKKHMF.K. — The 
following Is an extract from ft letter re- 
ceived by fc gentleman In this city from 
hit sitter, who has resided In Mobile for 
many years. The papers nt the South do 
not sample to positively deny that such 
events take place; — 
-The Freedmcn are working cheerfully 
end get high wages. They are peaceful 
and happy. Last Sabbath afternoon It 
was so warm that we sat upon the portico 
outside ol the house. It was pleiiaant to 
see them, so neatly dieted, returning 
from ehuroli. Much of their conversation 
oould be heard. Many were asking nno 
another about their homes and families, 
These latter, alter a long separation, are 
now being re-unlted, and are dwelling un- 
der their own vine and lijr tree, but 1 cun-

A few weeks since, the German Methtv 
- -dial CUurulu ViliicbJM*. been nm.eeuine.i 
hy Its builders for   some time, and whim 
Essex ConnIT Teachers'   Association. 
A meeting of the above named associ- 
ation was held at Danvera on Friday and 
Saturday, life 6th and 7th of the present 
month, which was, well attended by the 
teachers from different parts of tbo county. 
The session of Friday began with a short 
business meeting, after which the mem- 
bers were addressed by the President. 
Mr. Walton, of Lawruuee, who congratu- 
lated the association f on the favorable 
auspice* under which It met, referred to 
the specific object of the fonnatlun and 
maintaining of a society comprising the 
Instructors of the young, and from the 
results already accomplished, argued thai 
there waathe best enoourageuieut to hope 
for good In the future. 
A class of pupils was present from the 
High School In Sulciii. « ho gave,
1 under 
the direction of Mr. Davis, Principal ol 
the school, an exercise illustrating the 
mode of teaching Latin adopted by him. 
The performance was thorough and ex- 
haustive, and displayed the effects or 
et'ul, accurate training. Following 
this was an essay on the importance of 
teaching the Natural Sciences lu torn 
moii Schools, by Mr. Perkins of Law 
rcuee, lu which It was claimed that In 
the grades below High Schools much 
might ami should be done In giving In- 
struction concerning Natural Philosophy 
Chemistry, Zoology and Botany; thai 
these branches arc so practical that every 
one In this age ought to know something 
about them, enough at least, to read trea- 
tises upon them, and that under a Judt-

itation lu Arithmetic. They wore mainly 
confined to rapid addition, working from

who gave a paper on Teachers" Salaries. 
from which It appeared that the average, 
wages of successful male teachers was 
less than one-third of the Income of suc- 
cessful business men of the same locali-

the sentiment of the essay, that "The 
orkman is worthy of his hire." they 
counselled the teachers to look for their 
compensation to the sympathies of child- 
hood, and the remembrance In whirl 
they would be held by their pupils syhet 
their teaching days were over. 
One of the speakers stated with (Ten.ll

they asked to be liberally paid fur 
their services';   at present school-keeping 
was a luxury they could scarcely afford. 
the  result of  underpaying  Is. the  host 
touchers leave the profession.    Instances 
were cited where a few dollars additional 
salary would have sufficed to retain excel- 
lent teachers, but for want of which ihcy 
were allowed to leave      When all  the fV

It liai been noticed that selectmen and 
hlftura/ueo cut and slash among trees In 
a strange way, as.If no statutes ur-jtecttd 
these venerable Inhabitants nf ihe noil.—' 
Boyi take the axe and rnln trees by the

Im.ijrtnlnjf that there Is n heavy penally.

snper-abimriant side walk, was rinnVr-siy 
tut down! And lust week a splendlil elm, 
for no other offence than tempting buys 
lo swing and ■battling two (trailed apple 
tree, was disposed ol l» the same way.— 
When such llilmzs arn done In titfht ol 
Phillips Academy (supposed to be a liaunt 
of the inuset. not of wood choppers). It Is 
not to be wondered at that they are mak- 
ing up their minds as fast M they can,'to 
cut down tho great elm, lu the heart of 
the town of Andover. 
Now, my Andover friends, that noble 
old trftflj (..worth all the careof Andover 
men, select, and-.not select, to keep "It 
alive. Bandage up Us wounds, refre«h Its 
roots with new earth, and It.will repay 
your generosity by a new and vigorous 
growth Just as Its younger colleagues have 
done ou Boston Cnmitnm and elsewhere. 
A tree that ha* outlived the threats of so 
ninny select men, and the fires of boys, 
deserves some reverence. It wonld be a 
>-hame to let tuch a tree die of neglect.—

The advent of thia moat dreadful visitant, 
in an English emif-rstil nhip, at Hulifax.end 
the fear of its ravages the coning itimmtr, 
indue* ua to publish the) following concern- 
ing thi* disease ao little understood i it to 
from a pamphlet issued by Hoyt, Boston, be- 
ing a communication from Dr. Hamlin, the 
well known Missionary uf the American 
Board, in regard to ita treatment. Hia *»• 
perienca with the cholera renders hia remarka 
at thia time invaluable!— 
The cholera, which baa juet left u», after 
mining; fearful   ravage*,   ia   making   ita 
way into Europe, and will probably cross the 
Atlantic before another auromer baa passed. 
Having been providentially compelled to 
have a good degree of praciical acquaint- 
ance with it, and to ace it in all it* forma 
i-nontk-. * M«*I J-sso*. anos.-i rear, sod atsgea during each of iia invasions of 
Conatantinople, I wish to make my frienda 
in America tome suggestions which may re- 
ieve anxiety, or be of practical uae. 
1st. On the approach of the cholera, eve- 
ry family should be prepared to treat it with- 
out waitiing for a physician. It doea Eta work 
M> cxpeuiiiously, that while yon are waiting 
for a doctor it ia done. 
2d. If you prepare for it, it will not come. 
1 think there ia no disease which may be 
avoMed with to much certainly aa the chol- 
era. But providential circumstance*,or the 
thoughtless indifcretiona of tome member of 
a household, may invite the tmnck, and ihe 
challenge will never be refused, ll will prob- 
ably he made in the night, your physician 
ha* been called in another direction, and you 
must treat the cue yourself or it will be 
fatal. 
3d. Causes of attack. I hare personally 
investigated at leant a hundred ca<es, and not 
leae than three-fourths could be traced di- 
rectly to improper diet, or to intoxicating 
drinks, or to both uniud. Of tin remain- 
der suppressed perspiration would comprise 
a large number.    A  strong, healthy, tem-

tiff I was curious to   ssesrtain  the cause- 
He  had  bean cautious and   prudent in h 
diet.    He had used nothing intoxieating.- 
His residence was in a good locality.    But 
after so mi: hours of hard   labor  and   very 
profuas perspiration, he had   laid  down   to 
take hia customary nap directly   againat  an 
open window, through   which  a  very   fresh 
breexe waa blowing, Another cause ia drink' 
ing freely of cold water when hot and thirs- 
ty.    Great fatigue, great aniiety, fright, fear, 
all figure among inciting causes.    If one can 
avoid all these, he is ai safe from ihe   ehol 
era aa from being awept off by a comet. 
4th. Symptoms of m attack. While the 
cholera is prevalent in a place almost every 
one experiences more or less disturbance of 
digestloh. It is doubtless in part imaginary. 
Every one notices ihe aliehlest variation of 
fieling, and this gives an importance to mere 
trifles. There ia often a alight nausea, or 
transient pains, or rumbling sounds, when 
no attack follows. No one ia entirely free 
from these, But when diarrhoea eomnenc- 
ts, though painless and alight, it ia In reali- 
ty ihe skirmishing party of ihe advancing 
column. It will have at flrat no aingle char- 
acteristic of Asiatic cholera. But do not 
he deceived, ll is Ihe cholera, nevertheless. 
Wail a little, give it time to get hold, aay to 
yourself ' 1 feel perfectly well, it will aoon 
pass off,' and you will soon repent jour folly 
in vain. 1 have seen many a one cnm*rjii»u- 
ictde in ihia war. 
Sometimes, though rarely,the attack com- 
But in   whatever 
y It commences it.is sure to hold on. In 
a very few houra the pstient msy sink Enln 
the collapse. The hands and feet beeoras 
eold and purplish, the countenance at flrat 
nervous and anxious, becomes gloomy and 
apathetic, although I mental restlessness and 
raging thirst toi-aWnt ihe sufferer while the 
powers of life are ebb ng. The intellect re 
mains clear, but all the social and moral 
feelings seem wonderfully lo collapse with 
the physical powers. The paiitnt knows be 
Is to die, but ho oares not • snap about it, 
In some eaaea, though rarely, the diar-

COUBSE UP TREATMENT. 
1. Far Mopping the incipient diarrhoea. 
Tire mixture which I u»ed in 1848 with good 
success, end again in 185,">, haa during this 
epidemic been used hy thousneda, and allho' 
the attacks hsve been more sudden and vio- 
lent, it haa fully established its reputation 
for efficiency and perfect safely. It consists 
of equal parts by measure of 1. Laudanum 
and Bpiriia of Camphor. 2. Tincture of 
Rhubarb, 30 drops for an adult on a lump 
Of sugar, whU Af\aa> chick, th*. dumhrea. Hut 
lo prevent ita return, care should always be 
taken lo continue the medicine every four 
hours In diminishing doaea t*tenty>Ave,l«en- 
ty, Arisen, ten, sine, when careful diet is all 
that ia neeihro- —  
In aaaa Uw But do— doea not stay Ihe di- 
arrhoea, oontlnu. to flvt ln IntraaalRg doses 
thirty's*, fatty, forty-five, afsty, at every 
movement of the bowels. Large doaea will 
produce no Injury whir* the diarrhoea lasts. 
When that ia cheeked, then ia the time for 
caution. I have never seen g case of disr- 
TIMM talisu iu season which was not thus 
conlrolled, but some cases of advsneed diat- 
our example." 
rlupa, and especially of relapse, paid no heed 
to it whatever. As aoon as thie%ecotne ap-' 
parent, I have always resorted to the fol- 
lowing course. Prepare a teaeup Of starch 
boiled as for use In starching linen, aad stir 
into It a full teaspoonful of laudanum for an 
injection. Give owe third at each movement 
of ths howeb. In oat desperate case aban- 
doned as hopeless by a physician, I could 
not atop the diarrhoea until tha seventh in- 
jection, which contained nearly a tea-spoon- 
ful of laudanum. Tbe patient recovered and 
la in perfect health. At the same time I use 
prepared chalk in ten grain doaea with a lew 
drops of laudanum and camphor to each'.— 
But whatever course ia puraued It must be 
followed up, and the diarrhoea controlled or 
the patient is loat, 
3. Jafiuftwi I'liuHictM. These ahould be 
applied lo the pit of ihe stomach, and kept 
mi till.the surface ia well reddened. 
""JO'The pafieriCTteweverwehVhe may feel, 
should rigidly observe perfect rest. To lie 
(juicily on ths back is one half the battle, 
ln lhat position the enemy fires over you, 
hut the moment you rise you are hit. 
When ihe attack cotoea in the form of a 
diarrhoea, ihese directions will enable every 
one lo meet it successfully. 
4. But when the .attack in more violent, 
and there is vomiting, or vomiting and purg- 
ing, perhaps also cramps and colic pains, 
the following mixture is far more effeit've 
and should always be resorted to. The mis- 
sionaries, Messrs. Long, Trnwbridge, and 
Waihburn, have used it in very many cases, 
and with wonderful success. 
It consist* of equal parts or laudanum, 
tincture of capsicum, tincture of ginger, end 
tincture of cardamom seeds. Dose, thirty 
to forty drops, or half a teaapoonful in a lit- 
tle water, and to he increased according to 
the urgency of the case. In case tbe first 
dose should be ejected, the seoond, which 
should stand ready, should he given imme- 
diately after the spasm of vomiting bad 
ceased. 
During ihis'Wto cholera aiege no one of 
ui Tailed of controlling the vomitiug and aUo 
the purging by, at most, the third doi 
hsve, however, invariably made uae of large 
mustard ponltieea of strong, pure mustard, 
applied lo the stomach, bowele, calvea of the 
legs, fett, etc., aa tbe case seemed to re- 
quire. 
Cotlupte. Thia ia simply a more advanc- 
ed stage of the disease. It indicates the 
gradual failing of all the power* of life. It 
is difficult ao aay when a case baa become 
hopeless. At a certain point the body of 
ihe patient begins lo emit s peculiar odor, 
which I call the death odor, for when that 
has becom* decided and unmistakable,! have 
never known the patient to recover. I have 
repeatedly worked upon such cases for hours 
with no permanent result.i But the blue 
color; the cold extremities, the deeply sunk 
en eye, ihe vanishing pulse, are no signs that 
the case is hopeless. Scares of such cases 
in the recent epidemic have recovered. In 
addition to the aecond mixture, brandy (a 
tsblespoonful every half hour), botllsa of hoi 
water surrounding the patient, especially 
the eitremiliee, ainapisms and friction, 
often, in an hour or two work wonders. 
Thirst. In these snd in sll advanced cas- 
es, tl.irst creates intense suffering. Toe suf- 
ferer craves water, snd SB sure aa he gratifies 
ihe craving the worst symplnme return, and 
he falls a victim to ihe transient gratification 
The only safe way is to have a faithful friend 
or attendant who will not heed his entreat- 
irs. The Buffering muy be, however, safely 
alleviated and rendered endurable. Fre 
quent gurgling the throat and washing out 
tbe mouth will bring some relief. A spi 
ful of gum arabic water, or of chamoniils 
lea, may frequently be given to wet ihe 
throat. ' LydenhaoVe whit* decoction' mey 
also be given both aa a beverage and nout 
ishtnent, in email quantities, frequently. In 
a day or two the suffering from thirst will 
cease. In s large majority it has not been 
intone* for mor* than twenty-four hours. 
Diet. Rio* water, arrowroot, Lyndon 
ham's white decoction, crust waler, chsroo 
mil* too, are the best articles for a day oi 
two after the attack ia controlled. Chsmo 
mile is verr vslutbl* in restoring the tons of 
Ihe stomach. 
"TAV 7%pXvtit^mT. - A »yr*e*d al ate for 
a few days will follow all severe caaea ; there 
is nothing alarming in this. It haa.rery rare- 
ly proved fatal, Patience and careful nurs- 
ing will bring it all right. The greatest dan- 
ger is from drinking too freely. When the 
patient seemed lo be sinking, a little hiandy 
and water or arrowroot and brandy hav* re- 
vived him. In thia terrible visitation cf the 
cholera, wo hive considered ourselves per- 
fectly armed and equipped, with a hand-hag 
containing mixture No. 1, mixture No. 2, 
(for vomiting, etc.) * few pounda of pound- 
ed mustard, a bottle of brandy, and a paper 
of c'lamomile flower*, and * paper of gun 
erabie. 
I lay no claim to originality In recommen- 
ding ihia course of treatment. I have adop- 
ted ft from suggestions of able and egperlen- 
i*,l phya:cians. Having been the only doc- 
tor at many poor families living near me, J 
have tried rsrious remedies recommended 
by physician*, but I hav* found none to be 
st all compared wilh th* above. During tbe 
recent cholera, I canout And lhat any treat- 
ment haa been so successful as this, 
Cmmiagian. Tbe idea of coniagion ahould 
bo abandoned.    All th*   missionaries, who 
hsve been most with malignant cases day af- 
ter day, are fully convinced of the non-conta- 
glouaness of the cholera. Th* incipient at- 
tache which all hsve suffered from, *re to b* 
attributed to great faiigae. making tha con- 
stitution liable to sn stuek."

We mnkf a few extracts from th* admir- 
a>le addreaa of our Representative, General 
Banke, upon Uw late Senator Foot, in the 
House of Representatives, on Thursday last: 
The struggles of slavery culminated in 
th* measures of settlement in 18*0. It.was 
n the succeeding years that Mr. Foot ap- 
peared in the Senate. The great pailia- 
meutary leaders of the preceding genera- 
tions were passing sway.. Sam* of ihe vet- 
erans still bstllrd for s year or two and. 
all were gone. Of those, of the C*n*ti.tu- 
tional period not one remained. Nest men 
had.risen. New York and Ohio had broken 
the line of *ncienl precedent, snd wen rep- 
resented hy the Secretary of Stele and the 
Chief Justice of ihe present dsy. 
Massachusetts munifealsd a sljll more sur- 
prising revolution in political opinions in 
ihe election of the senior Senator uf her 
present delegation. The South, though suf- 
fering no revolution in opinion, bid gsined 
in unity of purpose and intensity of feeling, 
hst it had lost in authontj-^and talents bj 
the change of leaders. It was soon appai- 
nt that the bleeding wounds of the country 
had been assuaged but not hesled, Power 
had not clutched the object it coveted, and 
concession had not ao cared peace. Ihe com- 
promise of 1820 iu abrogated. Lurid 
tliunes of domestic violence and civil war were 
aeon in Kansas. The 1'realdenlial contest of 
I860 was marked for the first time by sec- 
ionsl lines, 
" 'Ihe Southern Ststee, threatened seces-

Senator of Vermont a theatre thnt might 
hsve satisfied the highest ambition tod the 
no blest pretensions. 
" It ia enough for ns to *sy a* we turn

Capl.H. O. Herrlck, HIierltT of Kstex 
County, being called upon said tlmt lie 
■hould fail to tlo Justice to the City Mis- 
sionary and the timchera who aasisted hhn 
if ho did not endorse everything that was 
lil of them which was good. He thought 
that Mr. Wilson In his report had fallen 
far aliort In hla recital ot the work perfor- 
med by him. He hnd distributed aiming 
the prisoners at tliejall pleuty of religious 
and tnoral reading, and with IIIB aid a 
I'll-" i.' mass or vile rending matter had been 
thrown out which hnd crept in. It seem- 
ed lo liliu flint A City Missionary of such 
qualities,who visited the bed of death 
or the sfck aud atUlctetl, distributing n 
tract here, a coat there, and a loaf In em- 
itter place, burying ttie dead, comforting 
the mourner, and doing all that his klinl 
heart prompts hhn tu du, deserved the 
luppurt of all good citizens, and that they 
hud no right to reject the cluliua of the 
Mission, especially If they were followern 
of their Divine Muster, who went about 
doing good. Missionaries who wanted 
Manuel* for the heathen in the East Indies, 
or cotton for the I.aplaud«rs, were soine- 
i lines ridiculed. We had the heathen at 
tur doors, nnd there wus no excuse for us.

■tmmlui.''.. Ijipf. Herrlck. cont-iwsktak fcw

Mr. Terklns. of the Illgli Scliool. cont- 
ueuted on the portion uf the report re- 
fetilug to education, and paid a merited 
tribute to the teachers of the Free Even- 
ing .School, 
ltev. Dr. rtoswortii said that he noticed 
is n prominent feature of the report, the 
rcllgloUs character of the work, that It 
trill conducted by a Christian clergyman, 
tnil he thought thnt one great cause of Its 
success. The founders of our republic 
made ample provi->ion for the education of 
the heart and conscience. The Hebrews 
on a certain day required the stranger to 
o the temple with his children and 
heitr the ten commriwhuents rend. Green, 
the unhappy man who had been executed 
luring the pfUj* week, was entirely desti- 
tute of the moral and religions principle 
.(licit should have pram pted hhn to pause, 
nd held hhn back when he wus thus 
temptetl to Invade the rights of another, 
und this was his ruin. It was religious 
culture which was the grand balance- 
wheel In the mind of Abraham Lluuotn, 
the anniversary of whose death was being 
remembered on that. day. and which sus- 
tained hint throughout his terrible trials. 
He was for enlarging the operations of 
the mis-ion In this direction, and spoke 
highly of the ragged schools of l.mnldn. 
He was severe upon the Catholic Church, 
and bellved that an earnest efl'ort should 
he made among the operatives lu the mills. 
He hail heard much profanity among the 
females. Dr. Bosworth concluded by 
trusting that earnest ladles would join the 
missionary In carrying on the great work 
which he had undertaken. 
After the singing of the doxology by 
■ If audience, the iiesemblage waa dismis- 
sed by a benediction from Rev. Mr. Par-

dltl themselves much credit Inat week, 
1 Tliumdiiy and Friday evenings, by 
giving to the people of this place two ex- 
hibitions which were in nil respects a per- 
fect success. It will doubtless do them 
more than Justice to Judge of both ex- 
hibitions by the one which It was our 
privilege to witness. Stephen Monegliati 
gav« "Hobert Kinmett'a Defence," In a 
style which rendered ii of peculiar Inter- 
est. L. W. Fogg, In " Onward for T 
perance.*' and C. B. Eaton in " Dotlea of 
Literary Men for their Country, gave evi- 
dence l|iat Ihe principles of declamation 
were not iinfnniilinr to tlieni; a little 
Blower movement would have been 
Improvement. The dialogues were 
good selection, and they were admirably 
performed. " The (jreatcat Plague Ii 
Life " was most evidently ahowu to be "1 
hired girl;" and llie lafly so plagued* 
must have been convinced that eeniiomy

training up her own family to household 
work.. " Box ami Cox" wan exceedingly 
Interesting. "Tlie Devil's Kitchen," a 
pantomime, wait sufficient In itself to 
cause otic to feel Hint he hud obtained his 
money's worth. The exercises were In- 
terspersed with charades, tableaux, and 
singing hy a quartette, which guvi 
them a"very pleasing variety.

handsome entertainment which was fur-

ED. AMKRICAN.—I cannot refrain, en- 
tertaining as I do a desire for the preser- 
vation of the reputation of our people, 
from earnestly protesting against the dis- 
play of rudeness at public places, which 
haa caused so much remark from stran- 
gers who have from time to time address- 
ed andlences In our churches or public 
hall. They have seen man after man, 
and I aw sorry to say, woman after wo- 
man, deliberately rise and go out at all 
points of their addreas or lecture, If they 
thought they could enjoy themselves bet- 
ter out of doors or at home, wholly disre- 
garding the distmeting enect upon the 
speaker, and the balance of the audience 
who might be Interested. Whether these 
persons were brought up In a hog pen. 
where selflshneea predominates, ur not. 1 
do not pretend to say, bnl that thc.v were 
not educated where good m minus were 
regarded, la very apparent. 
Another rude and selfish trick which 
too many of our people are guilty of is 
rushing.frantically for the door a few 
minutes before the address or entertain- 
ment closes, and this exodus often spoils 
tbe best of what Is presented, for those 
who have civility enough to see or her " 
through. If the house was ou tire there 
might be an excuse for such conduct 
though eveu then It could not be called a 
Christian act. Civility, and a jus| regard 
for the rights of others is the indication 
of the true lady and gentleman, and those 
who disregard them and crowd, pusb.aud 
take such advautages at tbe expense of 
of others,cannot lay elulm to either ol 
tin' three tides. At tbe proper plucc 
seems to me a smart hiss should be raised 
when such nu exhibition is made. 
Of the same spirit are people who re- 
fuse or neglect to move when they occupy 
room enough for two, and poople ur 
standing up all about lliem. and their 
neighbors have paeked themselves Into 
the smallest possible compass to iitnke 
more room. It la often the case tlmt 
there Is room fur scores within less than 
half the .distance'from the pulpit or the 
stage to the door, when stutidlug loom 
can hardly be.obtained near the door. 
I was glad-to see that at the White lec- 
tures, Mr. Frost, the cfllcieut usher, was 
careful to see that no such state of 11 = i.i -■ 
was permitted there, and that no one per- 
son occupied double (lie mom to which 
they were entitled. As 1 have before re^ 
marked those who arc destitute of (he in- 
Ntlncts of the lady, the gentleman, or the 
uliiUtiiin, cannot tlnd a, better opportu- 
nity to display ttie fact than to be miner 
cssailly guilty of such acts as the above

v TEMPKitANfK   MKITING,—The  regular 
semi-monthly meeting of the Temperance 
Alliance- was held at the Lawrence Street 
Church Sunday evening. Hev. Mr, Flatter 
presided.    After a  prayer  by Hev.   Mr.

Mr. Walrworth, the President of the 
Worklngmen'!. Total Abstinence Society. 
He was followed by John C. Sanboru, 
K-').. who presented tbe legal state of the 
liquor question, and closed hy remarking 
that the courts did not now show mercy, 
as they required *1000 hall, whereas but 
$300 was formerly demanded. If the 
temperance men who have the courts on 
their side, and who require less than a 
quarter of the capital that the liquor 
dealers are using to defeat the law. do 
not succeed now with their overwhelming 
majority they arc verily guilty. Mr. 
Eaton said that there were at least 3000 
young men In lids city who were not reg- 
ular attendants at church, and 1900 who 
used tobacco and whiskey, and were In 
live broad road tode-tnictlon. that Chris- 
tians were responsible for not tin nlng 
them aside. He pointed out the almost 
entire immunity the teetotalers had al- 
ways enjoyed where the cholera raged. 
He thought that temperance men should 
do all lu ihelr power to furnish evidence 
to com let sellers of liquor, and that If 
some action was not taken coon, the chol- 
-     _     era. tike jJiu rcbeJUoji, would be sent to 
eUAStfau us. 
Deacon Coolldgr gave sums statistics 
or pauperism and vice caused b> ardent 
spirit*. He urged every one present to 
i sign the 'pledge, and denounced all who 
■Aid not put their names to It. us haters of 
tiod. 
Hev. Mr. Street, of IJ0W.HI. gave sonic 
lirlormallon In regard to the suppression 
•of the imthV In that city. Kev. Mr. Wll- 
4MN spoke of a little girl of two years 
who could not walk without staggering. 
Her fattier ami mother wore and had 
Veen great drunkards for three years or 
-more, and she suffered for It. He read 
the ■enienoe and remarks of a Wisconsin 
jiwlg*' to * party of liquor sellers who bad 
beeft convicted. They were very severe. 
The pledge was passed around and over

About forty men and a doten teams are

side of the river, a portion near the pow- 
der bouse at the lower end of the pro- 
posed work, nnd tbe balance at the bend. 
Iheroad from tbe former point bus been 
built neross the Salem  railroad.    The 
ledge el the head had not been struck a 
day or two H*O, but If was expected could 
not be much deeper than the exonvatlon 
now unide. An Impression seems lohuve 
gone abroad that a work Is to be per- 
formed ihst will require several hundred 
laborers. A day or two since a man all 
the way from Vermont applied tor work, 
and said that be had been told Unit a 
thousand men were wanted In Lawrence 
nt two dollars per day. It Is not contem- 
plated that with stone masons, laborers, 
and all, more than a Hundred will be cm- 
plojcd at any time. The con tractor has 
hoiu twenty to lllly applications per day 
which he Is compelled to deny. The

would have proved fatal to a sober man. 
The wagoii was badly broken. A crowd 
gathered around, and some of his friends 
were dancing about in a, fraullo manner, 
wringing their hands and crying "Howly 
Mouses, he's kilt Inlhlrdy." His "re- 
mains" were taken Into a house and a 
surgeon called. He examined the man 
and found that tliete was no barm done 
beyond what a bowl ol water would re-
