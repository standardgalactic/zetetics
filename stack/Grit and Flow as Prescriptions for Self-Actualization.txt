INTRODUCTION
As the process of evolution allows species to grow and adapt 
to their environments, expectations for what those species are 
capable of achieving proportionally increase. 40,000 years ago, 
Homo sapiens began experiencing changes in cranial struc­
ture and brain development that anthropologists now refer 
to as “the great leap forward” [1]. As our prefrontal cortices 
began growing larger and increasingly capable of performing 
greater feats of executive functioning, our ability to antici­
pate and predict the consequences of our actions started to 
expand, and our personalities began developing in more 
nuanced ways [2]. Humans now have the uniquely dissonant 
experience of having exquisitely elevated thought, while still 
being bound by the same biological realities and compulsions 
as our fellow earth-dwelling creatures. The Homo sapiens of 
today perform acts of kindness for others with no expecta­
tion of reciprocity to enhance their own lives; a decision that 
would have been unthinkable in a time when survival was the 
first and only consideration. We have awareness of our place 
in the world, our cultural responsibilities, our role in society, 
our potential to do good or ill (and associated choice), and 
our own fragile mortality. Our new, highly developed brains 
have opened many doors of opportunity that our ancestors in 
past millennia had insufficient cognitive ability to access. But 
our novel sense of possibilities can also be a burden, leaving 
us wondering which of the many open doors would be best 
to walk through. The myriad potential choices for how to live 
our lives can facilitate existential angst, which comes from 
the distinctive experience of human freedom and responsi­
bility [3], leading many to wrestle with what their purpose 
in life “should” be, or how they can best maximize their per­
sonal utility given their gifts, interests, and privileges. The 
psychology and healthcare sectors have offered a diverse array 
of potential answers to these questions, but perhaps no theory 
is more famous or well-known than Abraham Maslow’s thesis 
of Self-Actualization.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Self-Actualization
“What a man can be, he must be” - Abraham Maslow
Maslow believed that the highest aim a person can strive 
towards is to become the absolute best version of themselves; 
to take their talents and abilities in their fields of interest to 
the utmost peak of their potential. He called this striving for 
maximization “Self-Actualization”, and further explained it 
to be “the desire for self-fulfillment… to become everything 
that one is capable of becoming” [4], and “intrinsic growth of 
what is already in the organism” [5]. Self-Actualization can be 
thought of as a drive towards our highest capabilities rather 
than a destination that is arrived at, as we can continually push 
the ceiling of our abilities through diligent practice, effort, 
and growth-oriented development. Psychologist Carl Rogers 
believed Self-Actualization could be achieved through gaining 
increased self-awareness in therapy [6], but Maslow assert­
ed that certain prerequisite conditions had to be met before 
Self-Actualization could be pursued. 
He called these conditions the “hierarchy of needs”; often 
referred to as “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs”, which are icon­
ically depicted as a pyramid in most Intro to Psychology 
textbooks. At the base of the pyramid are man’s most import­
ant needs for survival, “Physiological Needs”, including air, 
water, food, shelter, and clothing. Next up are “Safety Needs”, 
including personal security, employment, health, and resourc­
es for survival, followed by “Love Needs” of friendship, family, 
intimacy, and a sense of connection with others. The penul­
timate level of needs on the hierarchy are “Esteem Needs”, 
holding our needs for self-esteem, confidence, self-efficacy, 
achievement, and the respect of others, finally followed by the 
top level of the pyramid, “Self-Actualization” [4]. According 
to Maslow, we must satisfy the needs at one level of the hier­
archy/pyramid before moving on to the other levels. In other 
words, we can’t concern ourselves with our sense of achieve­
ment or confidence (Esteem Needs) if we don’t have shelter

Abstract
Psychology as a discipline has historically focused on psychopathology and associated evidence-based modalities to alleviate symptoms of mental illness and 
distress. In recent decades, however, there has been a shift towards studying the positive aspects of human experience that make life worth living. This Positive 
Psychological perspective was utilized by Humanistic Psychologist Abraham Maslow when he created his theory of Self-Actualization, in which he postulat­
ed that the highest aim a person can strive towards is to become the absolute best version of themselves, and to maximize their abilities and potential to the 
highest possible degree. Aside from describing a hierarchy of needs required before Self-Actualization could be realized, Maslow left little recommendation for 
how the phenomenon could be enacted. This article recommends the combined utilization of the non-cognitive trait of Grit along with the implementation of 
activities that promote the full-immersion state of Flow as prescriptions for Self-Actualization. Additional emphasis is placed on the importance of healthcare 
professionals utilizing the concepts Grit and Flow in their clinical practice with patients.

or enough food to stay alive (Physiological Needs); there are 
priorities. Looking at this hierarchy of needs, we can see how 
our ancestors with underdeveloped prefrontal cortices who 
were lower on the food chain were primarily (if not solely) 
concerned with meeting their Physiological and Safety needs. 
However, the contemporary human with enhanced cogni­
tive faculties and modern technology ensuring safety from 
predators has the luxury of being able to climb farther up the 
hierarchy towards Self-Actualization; we have the capacity to 
orient ourselves towards thriving, rather than just surviving. 
This growth-oriented outlook was a fundamental compo­
nent of Maslow’s psychological perspective of Humanistic 
Psychology, which rose to prominence just as he was con­
structing his theory of Self-Actualization in the mid twentieth 
century. Humanistic Psychology focuses on healthy moti­
vations and maximizing human potential through a 
strength-oriented lens, which is in stark contrast to Sigmund 
Freud’s Psychoanalytic Theory (which dominated the early 
decades of the twentieth century and focused on unhealthy 
motivations and psychopathology) [7]. This distinction is 
important to consider when discussing Self-Actualization. 
While the human brain and conditions of physiological 
safety were largely the same from the early- to mid-twenti­
eth century, the way of thinking about psychological health 
had begun metamorphosing. Speaking broadly, Psychoanal­
ysis largely focuses on what is wrong with the individual and 
how to fix it, and humanistic psychology focuses on person­
al agency and human potential. Psychoanalysis would never 
have focused on a construct such as Self-Actualization as a 
goal to strive towards, as Self-Actualization is growth-mo­
tivated rather than deficiency-motivated [5]. The focus on 
human strengths and capabilities in Humanistic Psycholo­
gy is quite similar to the focus of positive aspects of human 
experience and flourishing in Positive Psychology [8], which 
became a formal psychological perspective at the end of the 
twentieth century. Humanistic Psychology may have indeed 
passed the strength-oriented-baton off to Positive Psychology, 
as the first academic mention of Positive Psychology was in 
Maslow’s famous work, Motivation and Personality, in which 
the last chapter, “Toward a Positive Psychology”, called for 
man’s potentials, virtues, strengths, and aspirations to be stud­
ied in greater detail [5]. 
Earlier in Motivation and Personality, Maslow describes in 
detail the qualities that he believes are inherent in all people 
who are striving towards Self-Actualization, who have already 
satisfied the first four needs on his hierarchy. He states that 
Self-Actualizing persons have an efficient perception of real­
ity and are comfortable with their relations to it. They live 
more in the real world of nature than in the man-made mass 
of concepts, abstractions, expectations, beliefs, and stereo­
types that most people confuse with the world. They stay true 
to themselves and don’t strain to please others or conform 
to social norms; they’re less enculturated. They are not neu­
rotic, and rarely experience shame, anxiety, defensiveness, or 
guilt. There is no sense of “artificial dignity” or narcissism 
[5]. Self-Actualizing people are more aware of their subjec­
tive tastes and preferences, and this allows them to be more 
spontaneous. However, they are not distracted by desires and 
immediate concerns, and are more focused on the big pic­
ture - never getting “so close to the trees that they cannot see 
the forest” [5]. They experience mystic and peak experienc­
es on a regular basis and are dependent on their own growth 
for satisfaction rather than exterior sources of validation. Yet 
they focus on problems outside of themselves, and are not 
ego-centered. Self-Actualized people adhere to the Alderian 
spirit of Gemeinschaftsgefühl - a feeling of social interest that 
describes a state of social connectedness and concern with 
the well-being of others [9]. For Self-Actualizing individuals, 
“duty is pleasure”, and “work is play” [5]. 
When looking for the answers to maximizing our personal 
potentials in the pursuit of Self-Actualization, we are often 
instructed to consult the helpers in our society: our Doc­
tors, Social Workers, and Healers. Healthcare professionals 
are sought after for their expertise by individuals who want 
to improve their lives. Whether patients are recovering from 
physiological ailments, suffering from dysregulating psycho­
logical disturbances, or feeling stuck for reasons beyond their 
understanding, there are none among us who don’t wish to 
enhance our wellbeing and climb to the next level of our abil­
ities. While healthcare professionals are aided by modern 
technology and advanced training in their respective fields 
to deliver best practices to patients, the pursuit of becoming 
the best physical, psychological, and spiritual versions of our­
selves can be an exasperating expedition to embark on. To be 
best equipped for this journey, we need to think outside of 
the box and utilize different methods and practices that may 
exist beyond the standard recommendations and methodol­
ogies that have been historically employed by the healthcare 
industry. 
Indeed, the aforementioned depiction of Maslow’s concep­
tion of Self-Actualizing individuals is undoubtedly a lofty goal 
for everyone to strive towards. Perhaps it is for this reason that 
Maslow postulated that Self-Actualization “rarely happens… 
certainly in less than 1% of the population” [10]. While not 
backed by empirical evidence, such an assertion by an emi­
nently distinguished psychologist like Maslow is alarming. 
How can the ultimate state of being for mankind - the highest 
fulfillment of our abilities and potentials in our most devel­
oped level of evolution - only be achieved by less than 1% of 
the population? It is confounding to think that thousands of 
years of natural selection and adaptation have afforded Homo 
sapiens the ability to maximize their personal utility and apti­
tude to unprecedented heights, only to have a scruple actually 
realize that potential and step through the door of Self-Actu­
alization, so to speak. The present article will examine barriers 
to Self-Actualization that exist in society today and explore dif­
ferent constructs in the field of Positive Psychology (which 
were operationalized and defined after Maslow’s time) that 
may be able to offer a clearer path to Self-Actualization in light 
of identified barriers. 
Barriers to Self-Actualization
“Compared to what we ought to be, we are only half-awake”
 - William James
Fortunately, barriers to Physiological and Safety Needs in 
modern American society have been exhaustively studied and 
addressed through various social welfare and poverty alleviat­
ing programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program (SNAP), earned income tax credit, Social Security, 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Section 8, 
the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), 
Medicaid, and others. As a result, the vast majority of Ameri­
cans have access to the necessary resources for procuring food, 
water, shelter, and personal security [11, 12, 13]. While this 
is good news, we are so far only discussing the first leg of our 
Self-Actualization journey. 
Love and Esteem needs prove to be considerably more dif­
ficult to satisfy in the current cultural climate. Our need for 
Love on Maslow’s hierarchy describes our human desire for 
connection with others and meaningful bonds of intimacy 
with family members and loved ones. Unfortunately, 22% of 
adults in the United States today say that they always or often 
feel lonely, lack companionship, or feel left out or isolated, 
and 54% say that no one really knows them well [14]. Since 
Maslow’s time, the size of the average American household 
has noticeably reduced, as one-person households are now 
the 2nd most common household type [14]. As household size 
has decreased, distance away from other family members and 
friends has increased, and the frequency of our interactions 
with those that love us most has reduced and shifted from

in-person socialization to communicating via social technolo­
gy and networks, leading to emotional disconnection [15, 16]. 
Indeed, increased use of social media and other social plat­
forms has made it more difficult to satisfy our Esteem Needs 
on Maslow’s hierarchy (need for confidence, status, self-es­
teem, and achievement), as increased use of social media is 
correlated with low levels of self-esteem [17, 18]. This cor­
relation is concerning considering the significant increase of 
social media use in recent years [19], and this may contrib­
ute to the fact that most adult Americans have struggled with 
self-esteem issues at some point in their lives [20]. 
Here we can see why Love and Esteem are higher up on the 
hierarchy than Physiological Needs and Safety Needs; feel­
ing loved and accomplished are more elusive conditions to 
meet than staying dry or being well-nourished. While the 
realities of modern disconnection and self-esteem lowering 
platforms are obstacles to contend with, Psychologist Michael 
Lerner suggests that a primary reason why our lives are not 
all they can be is because we have come to believe that poor 
life circumstances cannot be changed [21]. While members of 
society are bound to some level of actual powerlessness given 
the structure of power in our society, Lerner believes that we 
add to that level of powerlessness “to the extent that our own 
emotional, intellectual, and spiritual makeup prevents us from 
actualizing possibilities that do exist… for us to actualize our 
Human Essence” [21]. He calls this additional self-imposed 
sense of powerlessness “Surplus Powerlessness”, and cites it as 
a major contributor in our inability to maximize our human 
potential (or strive for Self-Actualization, as Maslow might 
say). Lerner believes that there is an epidemic of unhappiness 
and unfulfillment in society as a result of Surplus Powerless­
ness, and that members of society go along with lives that are 
fundamentally unfulfilling because they feel that they have 
no alternative. This description bears striking resemblance 
to Martin Seligman’s concept of Learned Helplessness, in 
which individuals experience a profound loss in their sense 
of self-efficacy after being victims of circumstances beyond 
their control [22, 23]. The feelings of Learned Helplessness 
inherent in Surplus Powerlessness enable us to “become our 
own jail keepers”, and facilitate integration into “a cult of vic­
timhood that sometimes substitutes for careful thinking” [21]. 
Psychologist Aaron Beck, the father of Cognitive Therapy, 
might argue that feelings of Surplus Powerlessness contribute 
to cognitive distortions such as negative filtering, jumping to 
conclusions, and catastrophizing, all of which can lead to mal­
adaptive coping mechanisms [24, 25]. Lerner identified several 
such mechanisms that contribute to our inability to actualize 
our human potential. He acknowledges classic maladaptive 
coping strategies such as substance use and sexually acting 
out, but also asserts that people have a tendency to become 
preoccupied and overly engrossed in “frenetic activities” such 
as sports, politics, and religion as ways of coping to their own 
detriment. This may seem counterintuitive at first, as the 
physically active and community aspects of sports have been 
proven to be beneficial for overall health [26], and religion 
can be an ideal context to foster social bonds and member­
ship in a community [27], both of which would incline one to 
consider them as boons to the satiation of Love and Esteem 
Needs on Maslow’s hierarchy. However, when sports or reli­
gion (or any activity) become a person’s entire emotional life, 
it leaves little room for reflection, self-introspection, or a criti­
cal examination of the relationship between one’s self and one’s 
problems, and how that relationship is influenced by personal 
disposition or societal constructs [21]. For many, sports are an 
ideal vehicle for stress reduction, but it can also be used as a 
way to divert attention from the pains of the world; the pain 
doesn’t go away, it's just redirected or displaced. In religious 
communities, people may pray for absolution of sins or for a 
better life instead of recognizing their own role in their prob­
lems. Over-engaging in these activities and others can serve 
to further entrench ourselves in feelings of powerlessness by 
distracting us from working on ourselves, or from spending 
our energies in useful ways that would improve society and 
reduce sources of oppression that limit our ability to thrive 
and flourish [21]. 
Lerner refers to these distractions from dealing with inter­
nal difficulties as “narcotizing” coping strategies, which 
prevent us from realizing our full potentials. The ubiquitous 
availability of such attentional distractions in modern life, 
combined with the difficulty of introspection and stigma of 
self-improving practices such as psychotherapy, all contrib­
ute to a trend of complacency - ingrained to the point that 
not actively striving to become the best versions of ourselves 
has become normalized, despite our heightened, evolved 
capacities. Our lack of genuine social connectivity, over-uti­
lization of shallow social media platforms, and self-imposed 
Surplus Powerlessness have enabled average performance to 
be an acceptable ceiling for our standards. Maslow certain­
ly understood this to be true, and proclaimed that “what we 
call normal in psychology is really a psychopathology of the 
average; so undramatic and so widely spread that we don’t 
even notice it” [28]. Maslow believed that healthy human 
behavior should trend toward Self-Actualization. Therefore, 
he regarded behavior that was unconcerned with Self-Ac­
tualization (especially when the necessary conditions for it 
were in place) to be unhealthy, or pathological. Our patho­
logical complacency is likely what led him to deduce that less 
than 1% of people become Self-Actualized. However, there 
are constructs in Positive Psychology today that we can use to 
shape our behaviors and priorities in ways that can bolster our 
self-efficacy, sharpen our skills, and increase our sense of ful­
fillment and purpose. Since Maslow’s death, extensive research 
has been conducted on the non-cognitive trait of Grit, and 
the full immersion state of Flow. Were he alive today, Maslow 
would have assuredly endorsed these concepts as necessary 
components for the journey of Self-Actualization. 
Grit
“He who has a ‘why’ to live for can bear almost any ‘how’”
 - Friedrich Nietzsche
One factor that may contribute to Surplus Powerlessness 
are judgmental lamentations of our own shortcomings, with 
thoughts such as “if only I was smarter, I would be more suc­
cessful”, or “I’m just not naturally gifted enough to achieve 
more”. Research from the University of Pennsylvania dispels 
the legitimacy of such disempowering notions, however, with 
exciting exploration into the trait of Grit. Angela Duckworth 
is the world’s foremost authority on Grit, and she defines the 
trait as “perseverance and passion for long term goals” [29]. 
Grit has been shown to be a better indicator of success than 
intelligence and IQ, health, good looks, and talent [29]. When 
we look at the most prominent leaders in every field, the most 
consistent trait they share is Grit [30]. 
Scores on Duckworth’s Grit Scale (used to measure the 
trait) can predict which cadets at the United States Army’s 
West Point Academy are most likely to graduate from “Beast 
Barracks”, the initial 6-week training at the institution during 
which many new students drop out [29]. West Point is one 
of the most difficult academic institutions to gain acceptance 
to in the United States (10% acceptance rate), and every 
accepted student has stellar SAT scores, an elite GPA, and 
impressively well-rounded credentials. In a sample of emi­
nently qualified and talented applicants, Grit Scores are used 
to accurately highlight who among them are the most pas­
sionate and driven, and those are the cadets that are ultimately 
most successful. Duckworth states that Grit is about having 
an “ultimate concern”; a goal that you are so passionate about 
that it gives meaning and organization to everything that you 
do [29]. Failures on the road to achieving this goal are not a 
deterrent towards its striving, but are regarded as necessary

parts of the process. As Duckworth states, “The gritty indi­
vidual approaches achievement as a marathon; his or her 
advantage is stamina. Whereas disappointment or boredom 
signals to others that it is time to change trajectory and cut 
losses, the gritty individual stays the course” [30]. We can 
apply the imagery of the gritty individual’s achievement mar­
athon to Maslow’s belief that the multifaceted journey of life 
should be spent in the constant pursuit of becoming our best. 
Indeed, the gritty individual and the Self-Actualized indi­
vidual share many commonalities. Recall that Maslow’s 
Self-Actualized individual is focused on the big picture, 
less distracted by immediate concerns. Focusing on long-
term goals is a fundamental aspect of what defines gritty 
individuals, and their ability to be undistracted by short-
term satisfaction can be explained by Grit’s correlation with 
Self-Control and Conscientiousness [31]. For someone with 
Grit, “meaning seems more robustly related than pleasure 
to the subjective sense that one is fulfilling one’s potential in 
life” [32]. Fulfilling one’s potential is what Self-Actualization 
is all about, and Maslow’s Self-Actualized individual prefers 
a meaning-filled path over a pleasure-filled one. After all, for 
the Self-Actualized individual, “duty is pleasure”, and “work 
is play”, as previously stated [5]. Gritty individuals are those 
that pursue highly engaging and personally meaningful goals 
over a long period, and what makes this perseverance pos­
sible is an identified passion. Identifying such a passion or 
“ultimate concern” requires a great deal of self-awareness 
and connection with one’s values [31], and the same type of 
awareness of subjective tastes and preferences is inherent in 
Maslow’s Self-Actualized individual [5]. People who have 
Grit don't depend on positive feedback from others to sustain 
the pursuit of their goals; their passion is what drives them. 
Self-Actualized individuals are similarly unconcerned with 
exterior sources of validation. Here, we can see that the gritty 
and Self-Actualized serve as their own compass for direction 
in life. They are not swayed by what others think and do not 
submit to social conventions or societal pressures. The gritty, 
Self-Actualizing person stays true to themselves and their 
values and is continually connected to and inspired by them, 
acting in accordance with their passions and subjective prin­
ciples. In this way, they embody the Aristotelian notion of 
Eudaemonia, in which virtue is cultivated by living in harmo­
ny with one’s good (eu) inner spirit (daemon) [32].
While Duckworth’s gritty individual has much in common 
with Maslow’s Self-Actualized individual, the quality of Grit is 
also efficacious in meeting our Esteem Needs in Maslow’s hier­
archy. Grit is positively related to high levels of life-satisfaction 
and self-esteem [33], and this may be because unwavering 
perseverance towards goals allows us to successfully accom­
plish them, and thus experience a sense of personal agency, 
happiness, and achievement [29]. Grit and self-esteem may 
actually have a symbiotic relationship. While Grit allows us to 
experience accomplishment after successful strivings, which 
promotes self-esteem, high self-esteem in turn allows us to 
more robustly persevere through the failure inherent in all 
long-term efforts [33], and such perseverance is a definition­
al component of Grit [29]. In addition, increased self-esteem 
that results from accomplishments achieved through Grit 
can stimulate the realization of our highest potentials [33], 
or Self-Actualization. This is why Esteem Needs are directly 
before Self-Actualization on the hierarchy of needs [4]. 
Previously described barriers to Self-Actualization are a 
poor match for the gritty individual. While we may be greater 
distances away from loved ones than in generations past, the 
gritty family member and friend who values familial and pla­
tonic bonds will make associated socialization a priority, and 
thus will be undeterred by geographic inconveniences. Gritty 
individuals will not succumb to the impulsive and momen­
tary self-esteem reducing distractions abundantly available 
in modern society, such as social media, as their passion and 
drive for personal meaning is their top consideration. In the 
marathon of Grit-fueled achievement, obstacles such as feel­
ings of Surplus Powerlessness will still be encountered, but 
can be overcome with strides of effort, passion, and dedicat­
ed adherence to maintaining action in accordance with one’s 
values. If we stick with our passions and are undeterred by the 
external realities of societal constraints and internal realities 
of self-doubt and cognitive distortions, we can employ Grit as 
a means to unlock our highest potentials. 
For individuals who feel that they lack the necessary qual­
ities for success, healthcare professionals have a duty to extol 
the virtues of Duckworth’s research on Grit. Reminding cli­
ents of their passion or “ultimate concern”, or helping them to 
identify such a passion can aid clients in their striving towards 
achieving their goals and becoming Self-Actualized. For the 
patient in physical rehabilitation who is disheartened by a lack 
of improvement and mobility, or the cancer patient who is 
frustrated by a lack of apparent progress in chemotherapy, 
healthcare workers can remind them of their long-term objec­
tives and inspire future-oriented motivation. For the client 
who feels insecure about their intelligence or natural ability, 
education on Grit can be bestowed, - specifically the reality 
that effort and sustained passion are more predictive of suc­
cessful outcomes than other classically revered traits. 
Flow
“The self expands through acts of self-forgetfulness” 
- Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi
In the previous exploration of gritty individuals, we saw 
that being passionate about achieving a long-term goal can 
result in Grit-fueled perseverance and striving towards that 
goal, with the ability to withstand tribulations and diversions 
during that striving. One state of being that can significantly 
aid such striving is the full-immersion state of “Flow”; a state 
of such complete absorption that those experiencing it disre­
gard hunger, fatigue, and discomfort [34]. Experiencing Flow 
is often conceptualized as being “in the Zone”, as being in a 
Flow state allows us to operate at our full capacity for how­
ever long the state lasts [35]. In this way, those in Flow can 
be thought of as having micro-experiences of Self-Actualiza­
tion; performing at their maximum potential for moments at 
a time. To be in Flow, the level of difficulty of the task at hand 
has to perfectly match one’s skill level at that task. If the task 
is too difficult, we can become anxious, stressed, and neurot­
ic; too easy, and we become relaxed and bored [35]. Under 
this condition of engaging in “just manageable” challenges, 
experience seamlessly unfolds from moment to moment, and 
one enters a subjective state of intense focus where action and 
awareness are merged and temporal consciousness is distort­
ed, as time seems to pass faster than it actually is [35]. 
In addition to these criteria, tasks are able to induce 
Flow insofar as they are intrinsically motivating to the actor 
performing them. For this reason, those with “autotelic” per­
sonalities (from the Greek autotelēs: “auto” meaning “self”, 
and “telēs” meaning “goal”) are thought to be more likely to 
experience Flow in their day-to-day lives [35]. Those who 
are autotelic are curious, persistent, have well-defined future 
goals, and generally do things for their own sake, motivat­
ed by intrinsic rewards [36]. One best experiences a Flow 
state when not paying attention to their own experiences or 
desires, but rather have every faculty of attention focused on 
the presently engaged activity. Any spare attention not fixat­
ed on the task at hand could be focused on the self, and this 
is why there is a lack of reflective self-consciousness in Flow. 
By losing awareness of oneself as a social actor, one can expe­
rience self-transcendence and an elevated sense of perceiving 
the world [36]. This component of Flow is remarkably simi­
lar to a state of being Maslow described as regularly occurring 
in Self-Actualized individuals, who often undergo “acute 
mystic or peak experiences” where there is a “tremendous 
4

intensification” of concentration, and “a loss of self or tran­
scendence from it” [5]. Maslow is indeed describing a Flow 
state, long before the concept was ever operationalized or 
studied. It is intuitive, therefore, to extrapolate that a Self-Ac­
tualizing individual will experience states of Flow on a regular 
basis, based on Maslow’s description. 
Seeking Flow reflects a motivation to pursue one’s high­
est potentials [32]; a motivation that aligns perfectly with the 
values of the Self-Actualized. There are behavioral changes 
that we can implement in our striving towards Self-Actualiza­
tion that can promote the frequency with which we experience 
Flow, which will in turn assist our climb to the top of Maslow’s 
hierarchy. The simplest behavioral recommendation would be 
to increase the amount of time we spend on subjective pas­
sions that we find intrinsically rewarding and decrease the 
amount of time we spend engaging in momentarily pleasur­
able but ultimately unfulfilling leisure activities. This may 
prove to be a considerably difficult change to make, given the 
prodigious amount of media options available to us. With the 
flick of a finger, we have access to every TV show ever creat­
ed (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video), the answer to any 
question we can think of (Google, Yahoo!), and ability to view 
the activities and whereabouts of our friends at any given time 
(Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). Never before have so many 
distractions been so readily available, and the intense, fully 
engrossed attention required for Flow may be less attainable 
given the reality that nearly any passing curiosity or whim 
can be instantly satisfied with modern technology (though 
no research to date has been conducted to back this hypothe­
sis). Our goals and “ultimate concerns” must be pursued with 
increased vigor and impassioned Grit, so that we can maintain 
our Flow-requisite attentional acuity on what matters most to 
us, and tune out the hum of 21st century diversions. In this 
way, Grit and Flow are complementary constructs. The pas­
sion and perseverance towards long-term goals inherent in 
Grit is aided by the timeless, intense engagement in the intrin­
sically rewarding state of Flow. The partnership of these two 
concepts is a marriage built for the challenging journey of 
Self-Actualization. 
Growing with Grit & Flow
“Those that are consumed with the most relentlessness, and burn 
with the brightest flame, seem to serve the purposes of nature 
best” - Ernest Becker
Flow is experienced when the amount of difficulty in a pres­
ently engaged activity requires the exact level of skill one has 
in that activity. However, the more one engages in that activity 
through deliberate practice, the more skilled one becomes. As 
one becomes more skilled, the level of task difficulty required 
to experience Flow increases proportionally. Grit allows us 
to continually increase our skill level and ability by overcom­
ing challenges through diligent, passionate perseverance, and 
Flow can be considered the reward for increasing one’s skill 
to that next level. Psychologists at the International Labora­
tory of Positive Psychology in Moscow echo this assertion, 
stating in a recent publication that “experiencing Flow encour­
ages a person to persist at and return to an activity because of 
the experiential rewards it promises, and thereby fosters the 
growth of skills over time” [36]. Flow can facilitate sustained 
effort in our passions over time (Grit) not only because Flow 
states are intrinsically rewarding, but also because the intense 
engagement and experience of Flow helps us lose track of time 
[35]. This enables us to sustain effort for a longer duration 
without our conscious awareness, making the once effort­
ful now seem effortless. As Grit and Flow work together to 
increase our abilities in our chosen passions, they facilitate 
our upward trajectory on the final leg of our Self-Actualiza­
tion journey. 
Positive Psychologist Nico Rose conceptualizes Grit and 
Flow as alternating stages on the road to achievement. He 
also compares the working relationship of the concepts to the 
interchanging phases in the process of breathing - comple­
mentary opposites that work together to sustain life (or in 
this case achievement), just like inhaling and exhaling [37]. 
Grit takes intense effort, while Flow is effortless. Gritty per­
severance through adversity, failure, and distraction can be a 
torturously trying experience, while experiencing Flow has 
been equated to floating in ecstasy [34]. Flow requires regu­
lar task-related feedback to stay engaged and attuned, while 
Grit does not require task-related feedback, as passion is the 
combustion that propels action. We cannot breathe without 
inhaling and exhaling, and we may very well fail to achieve 
our highest potentials without Grit and Flow. 
What unites the two constructs is a future-orientation 
towards an identified passion. Gritty individuals are able to 
maintain their strivings because their long-term goals are so 
important that their attainment is worth years of continuous 
effort despite obstacles and setbacks. Autotelic personalities 
well-suited to experience Flow have clearly defined future 
goals [36] and are naturally disposed towards engaging in 
intrinsically motivated Flow-promoting activities that advance 
the achievement of those goals. Thus, the foremost step in 
our journey of Self-Actualization may be to identify a sub­
jective passion so valuable and inherently rewarding that it 
takes precedence over the various competing interests and 
distractions of life. 
CONCLUSION
As we have seen in Grit and Flow, the dogged pursuit of our 
life’s passion may be so engrossing that we occasionally forget 
Physiological and Safety Needs farther down on Maslow’s 
hierarchy, such as the need to eat, sleep, drink, and look after 
our health. Psychologist Michael Lerner warned us about the 
danger of having any one activity become our entire emotional 
life. A healthy, flourishing, and emotionally stable life requires 
a proportional balance of relationships with others, engage­
ment, meaning, and achievement [38]. However, in order to 
maximize our abilities as human beings in this unique station 
of our species’ history - where we have unprecedented cogni­
tive abilities to flex and a secure sense of safety from predators 
- some highly selective focus and abdication of comfort is 
required. How we conceptualize the difficulties inherent in our 
striving towards our passion will inform its achievement. If we 
adopt a deficit-orientation, lingering on the failures implicit in 
Self-Actualization’s perilous journey and accepting temporary 
limitations as “just the way things are”, we are unlikely to live 
up to our potential. However, if we view these difficulties and 
challenges through a strength-orientation, seeing obstacles as 
an opportunity to employ our Grit, and using Flow as a way 
to elevate our abilities to their highest level, we give ourselves 
the greatest opportunity to become Self-Actualized. 
Healthcare professionals must help facilitate this reframe 
for individuals who are seeking their care. When patients and 
clients attempt to address deficiencies in their lives respond 
to burdens and concerns, their clinicians have a duty to not 
only alleviate their symptoms, but to add to their previously 
established baselines of wellbeing by helping to orient them 
towards their passions. This enables individuals to tap into 
their internal reservoirs of Grit while prescribing correspond­
ing activities that promote Flow. Additionally, healthcare 
professionals can utilize the ethic of Grit and Flow-promoting 
activities of serving others for their own Self-Actualization. 
This may be achieved by connecting with their motivation 
to work in the helping professions and elevating their level 
of practice by continued striving towards maximizing their 
professional and personal utility. The path of Self-Actualiza­
tion will be different for each individual, but Grit and Flow 
can be applied to any challenge or endeavor. What Maslow 
found to be achieved by less than 1% of the population can

become more widely available through the utilization of these 
two constructs, and an outlook that relishes the possibilities 
in adversity.
