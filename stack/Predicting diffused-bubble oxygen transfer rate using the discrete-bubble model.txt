Abstract
A discrete-bubble model that predicts the rate of oxygen transfer in diffused-bubble systems is evaluated. Key inputs
are the applied gas ﬂow rate and the initial bubble size distribution. The model accounts for changes in the volume of
individual bubbles due to transfer of oxygen and nitrogen (and hence changing partial pressure), variation in
hydrostatic pressure, and changes in temperature. The bubble-rise velocity and mass-transfer coefﬁcient, both known
functions of the bubble diameter, are continually adjusted. The model is applied to predict the results of diffused-bubble
oxygen transfer tests conducted in a 14-m deep tank at three air ﬂow rates. All of the test data are predicted to within
15%. The range of bubble diameters (0.2–2 mm) spans the region of greatest variation in rise velocity and mass-transfer
coefﬁcient. For simplicity, the Sauter-mean diameter is used rather than the full bubble size distribution without loss of
accuracy. The model should prove useful in the design and optimization of hypolimnetic oxygenation systems, as well as
other diffused-bubble applications. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Thermal stratiﬁcation of reservoirs may result in
substantial hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. Low dis-
solved oxygen (DO) levels have a negative impact on
cold-water ﬁsheries, hydropower discharges, and the
drinking-water
treatment
process.
In
water-supply
reservoirs, low DO may lead to the production of
hydrogen sulﬁde and ammonia and can cause the release
of soluble reduced iron and manganese from the
sediments.
Iron,
manganese,
and
hydrogen
sulﬁde
impart undesirable color, taste, and odor to the water
requiring additional treatment prior to distribution
[1].
The
increased
oxidant
demand
at
the
water
treatment plant increases costs and, if organic matter
is present, may increase the concentration of disinfection
byproducts.
In the case of hydropower reservoirs, the US Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission typically requires that
releases meet local in-stream water-quality standards [2]
with minimum DO levels of about 5 g m3. As a
consequence, hydropower operators must frequently
add large quantities of oxygen to stored water prior to
or during discharge. For example, the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) spends about $2 M annually on
liquid oxygen that is added to several of their hydro-
power reservoirs [3]. Hypolimnetic oxygenation has also
been proposed by the US Army Corps of Engineers to
replace ﬁsh habitat [4], creating an environment up-
stream of a hydropower dam that is preferred by cold-
water species.
Hypolimnetic oxygenation is used to replenish DO in
reservoirs while preserving stratiﬁcation. Well-designed
hypolimnetic oxygenators provide measurable increases
in DO levels [5], decrease total iron, manganese, and
hydrogen sulﬁde concentrations [6,7], and decrease blue-
green algae concentrations in some cases [8,9]. Three
principle devices are typically used for hypolimnetic
oxygenation: the Speece Cone [10,11], the airlift aerator
[12–15], and the bubble plume [16]. Typically, pure

oxygen is used in the Speece Cone, air is used in airlift
aerators, and either oxygen or air is used in bubble
plumes.
In all three oxygenation devices, gas bubbles in
contact with water facilitate interfacial transfer of
oxygen, as well as nitrogen and other soluble gases.
Bubble size is a critical parameter in these diffused-
bubble systems because it determines the interfacial
surface area, bubble-rise velocity, and mass-transfer
coefﬁcient [17]. In addition, bubble size may vary
signiﬁcantly as the bubbles pass through the system,
especially when pure oxygen is used. For these reasons,
W.uest et al. [16] used a discrete-bubble model to account
for changes in the volume (due to gas transfer,
hydrostatic pressure, and water temperature) of indivi-
dual bubbles rising within a bubble plume. This
approach has subsequently been applied to airlift
aerators [13,18], the Speece Cone [10], and a bubble
plume
[19,20].
Although
limited
versions
of
this
approach have been used in diffused-bubble wastewater
and ozonation systems [21–23], the discrete-bubble
model has yet to be independently veriﬁed.
In this paper, the discrete-bubble model is used to
predict the rate of oxygen transfer during diffused-
bubble aeration, based solely on knowledge of the initial
bubble-size distribution and the applied air ﬂow rate. In
addition, it is shown that the Sauter-mean diameter [24]
may be used instead of a bubble size distribution
without any loss of computational accuracy.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Oxygen transfer tests
Oxygen transfer tests were conducted in a 14-m
high  2-m diameter tank with a porous ‘‘soaker’’ hose
diffuser [2] used to generate bubble-plumes. A schematic
representation of the diffuser arrangement is shown in
Fig. 1. A 1.5-m length of diffuser with 2  1.5-m lengths
of 6.4-mm diameter porous hose was located 0.6 m
above the base of the tank. DO in the water was
removed using sodium sulﬁte with cobalt chloride as a
catalyst. Tests were performed at air ﬂow rates of 0.43,
0.68, and 2.88 N m3 h1, where 1 N m3 denotes 1 m3 of
gas at 1 bar and 01C. The air ﬂow rate was measured

using a calibrated rotameter. The temperature of the
water remained constant at 231C during the tests. DO
was measured using probes placed in the tank at depths
of 3, 8, and 12 m below the water surface.
2.2. Measurement and representation of bubble-size
distribution
In a separate series of experiments, a single 30-cm
length of porous hose was placed 50 cm above the base
of the tank, and positioned 9 cm behind a glass porthole
along with a graduated scale (2-mm resolution). Tests
were conducted at four air ﬂow rates and at water
depths of 6.7 and 12.5 m to determine the effect of air
ﬂow rate and hydrostatic pressure on initial bubble size.
Duplicate tests were performed at approximately the
same air ﬂow rates and water depth. As shown in Fig. 2,
photographs of the bubble swarm immediately above
the porous hose were taken through the porthole.
The photographs were digitized and 20 bubbles were
randomly selected for measurement. Previous research
suggests that a total of 20 bubbles will provide a
representative sample [25–27]. Because the larger bub-
bles are typically not perfectly spherical, the horizontal
and vertical axis of each bubble was measured. The
surface area of a bubble, A; is
A ¼ pdxdzðmm2Þ;
ð1Þ
where dx and dz are the bubble diameters in the
horizontal and vertical axis, respectively. The equivalent
spherical diameter is
d ¼

Because of the increased complexity of applying the
discrete-bubble model using the entire bubble size
distribution, a Sauter-mean diameter was calculated
for each distribution. The Sauter-mean diameter is the
diameter of a sphere having the same volume-to-surface
ratio as the distribution of bubbles [28,24], or

where di is the diameter of the individual bubbles and n
is the number of bubbles in the sample. This formula
gives more weight to larger bubbles, and is therefore
more representative for mass transfer than the mean
bubble diameter [24].
3. Discrete-bubble model
The discrete-bubble model, ﬁrst adopted by W.uest
et al. [16], is applied to bubbles that rise in plug ﬂow
through a tank of well-mixed water. The initial bubble
size distribution and the rate of bubble formation are
assumed to be constant. Bubble coalescence and mass
transfer of gases other than nitrogen and oxygen are
considered negligible. The water and air temperatures
are assumed to be equal and constant. Mass transfer
through the water surface at the top of the tank is
neglected. Finally, it is assumed that a distribution of
bubble sizes may be represented by the Sauter-mean
diameter.
The mass-transfer ﬂux (for either oxygen or nitrogen)
across the surface of a bubble is
J ¼ KLðCs  CÞ ðmol m2 s1Þ;
ð4Þ
where KL is the liquid-side mass-transfer coefﬁcient, Cs
is the equilibrium concentration at the gas/water inter-
face, and C is the bulk aqueous-phase concentration.
For both oxygen and nitrogen, gas-side mass-transfer
resistance may be neglected. Henry’s law is used to
calculate the equilibrium concentration, or
Cs ¼ HPi ðmol m3Þ;
ð5Þ
where H is Henry’s constant and Pi is the partial
pressure of the gas at a given depth. Combining Eqs. (4)
and (5) yields
J ¼ KLðHPi  CÞ ðmol m2 s1Þ:

mean bubble diameter of 1.9 mm.

ð8Þ
where z is the vertical coordinate of the tank. Although
the bulk of the water in the tank is assumed to be well-
mixed, it is likely that a weak plume is formed
immediately above the diffuser in the core of the tank.
For simplicity, it is assumed that the induced plume
velocity is low relative to the bubble-rise velocity.

If the bulk aqueous-phase concentration does not
change signiﬁcantly during the time a bubble takes to
rise through the tank, the pseudo-steady-state assump-
tion may be invoked. Eq. (11) is integrated numerically,
for both oxygen and nitrogen, to obtain the change in
the molar ﬂow rate while the gas bubble is in contact
with the water. H is a function of water temperature,
while vb and KL are functions of r; the radius of the
bubble. The bubble radius changes in response to
decreasing hydrostatic pressure as well as the amount
of oxygen and nitrogen transferred between the bubble
and the water. This results in a change in the partial
pressure of oxygen and nitrogen within the bubble,
which is recalculated as the bubble rises through the
tank. As summarized in Table 1, relationships for vb

(Fig. 3) and KL (Fig. 4) were developed by W.uest et al.
[16] based on experimental data for bubble-rise velocity
[31] and the mass-transfer coefﬁcient [17]. Using these
relationships and the changing bubble radius, both the
bubble-rise velocity and the mass-transfer coefﬁcient are
recalculated as the bubble travels up the tank. Once the
bubble reaches the top of the tank, the overall change in
the molar ﬂow rate of gas (both oxygen and nitrogen) is
used
to
incrementally
calculate
the
evolving
bulk
aqueous-phase concentration as a function of time.
The initial DO concentration, water temperature, and
depth are known, as well as the initial Sauter-mean
diameter of the bubble swarm formed at the diffuser.
The initial dissolved nitrogen concentration is assumed
to be at equilibrium with the atmosphere. The initial
molar ﬂow rate of gaseous oxygen or nitrogen is

where Y0 is the initial mole fraction of the gas, Pstd is the
standard pressure, Qstd is the gas ﬂow rate at standard
temperature and pressure (01C and 1 bar), R is the ideal
gas constant, and Tstd is the standard temperature.
4. Results and discussion
The results of the three oxygen transfer tests are
shown in Fig. 5. For each of the tests, the response of the
three oxygen probes (located near the top, middle, and
bottom of the tank) was virtually identical, conﬁrming
that the water in the tank can be considered well-mixed.
Because the data obtained from the three probes were
almost equal, the three data sets were averaged to obtain
one representative oxygen concentration proﬁle for each
experiment. To apply the discrete-bubble model, the
initial bubble size for each of the air ﬂow rates is
required.
Fig. 6 summarizes the results of the bubble size
measurements. The measured initial Sauter-mean dia-
meter is shown as a function of the actual volumetric gas
ﬂow rate for the tests performed at depths of 6.7 and
12.5 m. Since there was essentially no difference between
the bubble sizes formed at these two different depths, a
simple linear relationship was developed relating bubble
size to gas ﬂow rate:
d3;2 ¼ 1:12 þ 0:938q ðmmÞ;
ð13Þ
where q is the actual gas ﬂow rate per unit length of
porous hose in units of m2 h1. Eq. (13), which was
derived from data collected using a 30-cm length of
porous hose, was then used to predict the initial bubble
size for each of the three diffuser experiments. The
Sauter-mean diameters obtained were 1.2, 1.2, and
1.6 mm for the 0.43, 0.68 and 2.88 N m3 h1 tests,
respectively. These bubble sizes and the measured air
ﬂow rates were used as input to the discrete-bubble
model to predict the oxygen concentration as a function
of time. The predicted results are compared in Fig. 7 to
the average of the values measured with the three oxygen
probes. The observed and predicted DO curves compare
well, with root mean square errors of 0.65, 0.60 and 1.31
for the 0.43, 0.68 and 2.88 N m3 h1 tests, respectively.
The initial predicted oxygen transfer efﬁciency ranges
from 94.4% at the lowest air ﬂow rate to 88.1% at the
highest air ﬂow rate. Although the model tends to over-
estimate the oxygen concentrations, nearly all of the
predictions fall within 15% of the observed data, as
shown in Fig. 8. As indicated in Fig. 6, the indepen-
dently measured initial bubble sizes had a relatively high
degree of variability. Given that the model is sensitive to
the initial bubble size, it may be that the bubble-size

estimation procedure is the primary source of the
modest error. In the following sections, some of the
key assumptions and limitations of the discrete-bubble
model are brieﬂy evaluated.
4.1. Bubble-size distribution
The Sauter-mean diameter may not accurately repre-
sent the average bubble-rise velocity or mass-transfer
coefﬁcient of the bubble swarm. Smaller bubbles, in
particular, have rise velocities and mass-transfer coefﬁ-
cients that are very sensitive to bubble diameter. To
check the validity of the Sauter-mean diameter, the
discrete-bubble model was modiﬁed to accommodate a
range of bubble sizes. The bubble size distribution for
the 0.68 N m3 h1 oxygen transfer test was obtained
from the bubble size data measured at 0.09 m2 h1
because the actual ﬂow rates (i.e., measured at the
diffuser depth) per unit length of porous hose were
approximately equal. As shown in Fig. 9, the initial
bubble diameters in this distribution vary from 0.2 to
1.5 mm and span the range of rapid variation in bubble-
rise velocity and mass-transfer coefﬁcient. Fig. 9 also
shows the ﬁnal bubble size distribution predicted for the
bubbles at the top of the tank. Using the entire bubble
size distribution instead of the Sauter-mean diameter
produced a similar rate of oxygen transfer, as shown in
Fig. 10.
4.2. Bubble-rise velocity
The discrete-bubble model uses correlation equations
to determine terminal rise velocity based on data
collected by Haberman and Morton [31]. As shown in
Fig. 3, for diameters between 1 and 2 mm, the bubble-

rise velocities in distilled and tap water are quite
different, with the W.uest et al. [16] correlation falling
between the two data sets. Since bubbles in tap water
smaller than about 2 mm behave as rigid spheres with
regard to rise velocity [31], the terminal rise velocity can
be calculated from

and mL is the dynamic viscosity of water. Fig. 3 shows
that Eq. (14) predicts the tap water data up to a bubble
diameter of 2.6 mm.
Larger bubbles begin to experience surface oscilla-
tions and the rise of the bubble can be compared to a
wave traveling in an ideal ﬂuid [29]. Based on this wave
analogy, the rise velocity of larger bubbles can be
predicted [29] by

;
ð17Þ
where s is the interfacial surface tension of water. Fig. 3
shows that Eq. (17) can be used to predict the rise
velocity for bubbles larger than 2.6 mm in tap water.
Since the tap water data appear more appropriate for
hypolimnetic oxygenation, Eqs. (14) and (17) can be
used to predict the theoretical rise velocity for the entire
range of bubble sizes and have the added beneﬁt of
including the dependence on temperature. However,
using the theoretical rise velocity instead of the W.uest
et al. [16] correlation made essentially no difference to
the model predictions, with values shown for compara-
tive purposes in Fig. 10.
4.3. Mass-transfer coefﬁcient
The mass-transfer coefﬁcient is also estimated using a
correlation equation developed by W.uest et al. [16]. The
correlation shown in Fig. 4 gives the mass-transfer
coefﬁcient for oxygen and nitrogen as a function of
bubble
radius
for
bubbles
of
diameter
less
than
approximately 1.3 mm, and assumes a constant mass-
transfer coefﬁcient for bubbles larger than 1.3 mm in
diameter. Unfortunately, the data in Fig. 4 were not
referenced to a speciﬁc water temperature [17] and could
not be corrected to the temperature of the oxygen
transfer tests (231C). The temperature dependence of
the mass-transfer coefﬁcient is given [30] by

ð19Þ
is the Schmidt number and DL is the diffusion coefﬁcient
of oxygen or nitrogen in water. Assuming the data of
Motarjemi and Jameson [17] were collected at 201C, the
mass-transfer coefﬁcients for both oxygen and nitrogen
would increase by about 8% because the experiments
were conducted at 231C. However, this correction makes
very little difference to the predicted oxygen concentra-
tion proﬁles shown in Fig. 7 because the oxygen transfer
process is approaching saturation. This holds at the
beginning of the experiment when the oxygen transfer
efﬁciency is high, as well as towards the end of the
experiment when the aqueous concentration approaches
steady state.
4.4. Induced water velocity
Another assumption made during the application of
the
model
is
that
any
induced
water
velocity
is
negligible. If this assumption is not correct, then the
water velocity would decrease the bubble contact time
and reduce the extent to which the model over-predicts
the experimental data. Efforts were made to measure the
induced water velocity, but it was found to be less than
0.04 m s1, the lower measurement limit of the velocity
meter used. The discrete-bubble model was modiﬁed to
include a uniform vertical velocity (see Eq. (8)) equal to
0.04 m s1, but Fig. 10 shows that this results in only a
modest decrease in the predicted oxygen concentrations.
5. Conclusion
The predictions of the discrete-bubble model were
compared to the results of diffused-bubble oxygen
transfer tests conducted in a 14-m deep tank at three
air ﬂow rates. Required model inputs are the gas ﬂow
rate and the initial bubble size distribution. Although
the bubble-size distribution can be taken into account,
using the Sauter-mean diameter is simpler and provides
equivalent results. Based on correlation equations for
bubble-rise velocity and the mass-transfer coefﬁcient
developed by W.uest et al. [16], the model predicts all the
oxygen transfer test data to within 15%. The range of
bubble diameters measured during the tests was from 0.2
to 2 mm, spanning the region of greatest variation in rise
velocity and mass-transfer coefﬁcient. The discrete-
bubble model has also been applied to predict oxygen
transfer in a full-scale airlift aerator [18], where the

range of bubble diameters was from about 2 to 4 mm.
Although the model tends to over-estimate the rate of
oxygen transfer in the well-mixed tank and under-
estimate the rate in the airlift aerator, the combined
results suggest that the model is reliable for bubble sizes
between 0.2 and 4 mm. In both cases, the initial bubble
sizes were measured in laboratory experiments carried
out completely independent of the oxygen transfer tests.
Since both sets of data had a relatively high degree of
variability and because the model is sensitive to initial
bubble size, it appears plausible that the bubble-size
estimation procedure is the primary source of the
modest error.
The discrete-bubble model has been successfully used
to predict oxygen transfer in a well-mixed tank (this
work), an airlift aerator [18], and a bubble plume [19,20].
The discrete-bubble approach has also been applied to
the Speece Cone [10], but the model could not be fully
veriﬁed due to a lack of experimental data. Because it is
known
that
hypolimnetic
oxygenators
can
induce
varying degrees of mixing in a stratiﬁed reservoir [19],
the suite of models is being coupled with a hydro-
dynamic and water-quality reservoir model so that
oxygenation systems can be designed more effectively
and operated more efﬁciently.

Abstract
Water ﬂow rate, gas-phase holdup, and dissolved oxygen (DO) proﬁles are measured in a full-scale airlift aerator as a
function of applied air ﬂow rate. A model that predicts oxygen transfer based on discrete-bubble principles is applied.
The riser DO proﬁles are used to calculate the initial bubble size. The range of calculated bubble diameters obtained
using the model is 2.3–3.1 mm. The Sauter-mean diameter of bubbles measured in the laboratory ranged from 2.7 to
3.9 mm. The riser and downcomer DO proﬁles and gas holdups predicted by the model are in close agreement with the
experimental results. A model that predicts water ﬂow rate based on an energy balance is used to calculate Kt; the
frictional loss coefﬁcient for the air–water separator. Excluding the data at the very lowest air ﬂow rate, the range of
calculated values for Kt (3–8) is close to a literature value of 5.5 proposed for hydrodynamically similar external airlift
bioreactors. The models should prove useful in the design and optimization of airlift aerators. r 2002 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
Artiﬁcial aeration is commonly used to prevent
anoxia in the hypolimnion of stratiﬁed reservoirs.
Hypolimnetic oxygenation and destratiﬁcation are the
two primary methods of artiﬁcial aeration [1]. Hypo-
limnetic
oxygenation
has
several
advantages
over
destratiﬁcation: nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus)
are not carried to the epilimnion where they can
stimulate algal growth, and the process can create or
preserve a cold-water ﬁshery habitat for species such as
trout or salmon [1].
Based on an extensive review of the literature on
hypolimnetic aeration (hereafter referred to as hypolim-
netic oxygenation), McQueen and Lean [2] reached the
following conclusions: (1) well-designed oxygenation
systems have maintained stratiﬁcation and have not
increased hypolimnetic water temperature signiﬁcantly;
(2) hypolimnetic oxygen levels increased; (3) iron,
manganese, hydrogen sulﬁde, and methane concentra-
tions decreased; (4) zooplankton populations were
generally unaffected; (5) chlorophyll-a concentrations
were usually not altered; and (6) depth distributions of
cold-water ﬁsh populations increased. The effects of
hypolimnetic oxygenation on phosphorus levels have
been more variable. McQueen et al. [3] attribute this to
pH levels and iron availability for phosphorus precipita-
tion. More recently, G.achter and Wehrli [4] concluded
that internal cycling of phosphorus was not affected by
increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations.
The published effects of oxygenation on nitrogen levels
have not been consistent either; ammonium and total
nitrogen decreased in some studies, but increased in
others [2]. It has been reported that gaseous nitrogen
concentrations were elevated to supersaturated levels
during hypolimnetic oxygenation with compressed air,
and some concern has been expressed over causing gas-
bubble disease in ﬁsh [5]. However, McQueen and Lean
[2] found no reported adverse effects of hypolimnetic
oxygenation on ﬁsh populations.
One of the three commonly used types of hypolim-
netic oxygenators is the airlift aerator [6]. When

designing airlift aerators, one of the major difﬁculties
has been predicting the oxygen input rates [7]. The
oxygen input rate can be determined if the induced water
ﬂow rate and the increase in the dissolved oxygen
concentration produced by the aerator are known. In
contrast to studies on the limnological effects of
aeration, relatively few researchers have developed
methods
to
estimate
oxygen
input
rates
[8–11].
Taggart and McQueen [11] reported that it might be
difﬁcult
to
accurately
predict
the
oxygen
transfer
efﬁciency of an aerator. To avoid undersizing aerators,
Ashley et al. [9] recommended that oxygen addition
should be set conservatively between 1.0 and 4.0 g m3.
The oxygen input rate is strongly dependent on the
induced water ﬂow rate. Taggart and McQueen [11]
developed an empirical equation for estimating water
ﬂow rate as a function of riser tube height and
volumetric air ﬂow rate. To avoid undersizing aerators,
Ashley et al. [9] suggested that a water velocity of 0.45–
0.50 m s1 be used if no better information is available.
Little [12] developed a model to predict oxygen
transfer based on fundamental principles; however, it
requires the use of correlation equations to predict the
mass-transfer coefﬁcient and the gas holdup. Burris and
Little [13] developed a more fundamental approach
patterned after the bubble-plume model of W.uest et al.
[14] to predict oxygen transfer rates in airlift aerators. A
model for predicting water ﬂow rate in airlift aerators
was previously developed based on an energy balance
[15]. The model takes into account energy introduced by
isothermal gas expansion and energy loss due to bubble
wakes and friction. The approach is similar to that used
in external-loop airlift bioreactors [16–20], which are
hydrodynamically similar to airlift aerators. In this paper,
these more fundamental oxygen transfer and water ﬂow
rate models are extended and validated using experi-
mental data collected from a full-scale airlift aerator.
2. Equipment and methods
The aerator used in this study is part of the City of
Norfolk’s aeration system installed in two of its water
supply reservoirs, Lake Prince and Lake Western Branch.
The lakes are located in Suffolk County, VA and have a
total capacity of approximately 49  106 m3. In the past,
anoxic conditions have developed in both lakes during the
stratiﬁed period. Aerators were installed to increase dis-
solved oxygen levels and, hence, to improve water quality.
2.1. Airlift aeration system
Ten airlift aerators in Lake Prince and 17 in Lake
Western Branch were operating at the time of this study.

Compressed air is supplied to individual aerators from
two sets of on-shore compressors through a metering
manifold, and each line is equipped with a mass ﬂow
meter. The bulk of the aerator (Fig. 1) consists of three
vertical pipes and an air–water separator box, all
constructed of ﬁberglass. The center pipe is the riser
tube with a diffuser located at the bottom. The diffuser
consists of two pieces of 3.8-cm diameter, schedule-80,
PVC pipe mounted vertically on the ends of a tee. The
length of each diffuser pipe is 0.86 m with 3.2-mm
oriﬁces towards the top. The oriﬁces are in ﬁve vertical
rows approximately 1.3 cm apart, with 12 per row
spaced 2.5 cm apart. The holes are oriented on one side
of each diffuser, and the diffuser pipes are mounted with
the oriﬁces pointing in opposite directions. The riser
tube has a telescoping feature that allows the top of the
aerator to remain ﬂoating, while the base is anchored to
the lake bottom. The two outer pipes are the down-
comers, which discharge oxygenated water at a speciﬁed
lake depth. In addition to the primary diffuser unit in
the riser, two auxiliary diffusers are located in each of
the downcomers. These are 25-cm diameter, circular-
disk,
ﬁne-bubble,
rubber-membrane
diffusers.
The
downcomers are equipped with bafﬂes at their outlets
to deﬂect the discharge jet away from the sediments. The
data used to verify the models were obtained speciﬁcally
from Lake Prince Aerator 1 (LPA1). Table 1 gives a
summary of the relevant dimensions of this aerator
during testing.
When diffused air is introduced to the water within
the riser, it creates an air–water mixture that is less
dense than the surrounding water causing the buoyant
mixture
to
travel
up
the
riser
tube.
When
the
mixture reaches the top of the riser, some of the bubbles
escape into the atmosphere while the rest are entrained
in the water that enters the two downcomers. The
oxygenated
water
then
ﬂows
through
the
down-
comers and is discharged at a depth approximately
equal to the depth water is withdrawn from the lakes for
treatment.

2.2. Field equipment and methods
Field experiments were conducted over a wide range
of
air
ﬂow
rates
(0.018–0.063 Nm3 s1),
the
only
adjustable process variable (1 Nm3 denotes 1 m3 of gas
at 1 bar and 01C). Air ﬂow rates were measured at the
aerator using calibrated rotameters speciﬁcally installed
in the air supply lines. During the oxygen transfer tests
reported here, air was supplied only to the diffuser
within the riser, with no air ﬂow to the auxiliary
diffusers in the downcomers. Tests were performed in
duplicate, and the data recorded during each run
included air ﬂow rate and temperature, water tempera-
ture, riser and downcomer gas holdup, water velocity,
and dissolved oxygen (DO) proﬁles in the riser and both
downcomers. The average measured water temperature
during the tests was 211C. The average temperature of
the air supplied to the aerators during the tests was
201C. The air temperature was measured at the aerator.
Water column temperature and DO proﬁles were
collected immediately adjacent to LPA1 3 weeks after
the tests were completed. As shown in Fig. 2, the
reservoir was still weakly stratiﬁed after the testing
period.
A YSI Model 610 data logger and sonde were used to
measure dissolved oxygen and water temperature. A
Swoffer Model 2100 stream current propeller meter was
used to measure water velocity. The velocity meter was
modiﬁed to obtain readings in both vertical directions
for use in the riser and downcomers. Prior to testing, the
performance of the meter was evaluated in a laboratory
ﬂume and good agreement (710%) between readings
was obtained. Testing of the velocity meter in the ﬂume
was conducted using water. However, the measurements
are considered applicable to the airlift aerator because
the gas holdup did not exceed 5 percent over the range
of applied air ﬂow rates. Water ﬂow rate was determined
using the velocity–area method. Velocity measurements
were obtained within the riser at a depth of approxi-
mately 1.4 m. Data were obtained from a single location
within the cross section. Ten readings were taken for
each experimental condition, with each reading a 30-s
average of the actual velocity at that point. The readings
were then averaged to calculate the induced water
velocity, and hence observed water ﬂow rate. Gas
holdup was determined by the volume expansion
technique. The height of the gas–liquid dispersion
during aeration was determined using a measuring tape.
The volume expansion technique is a simple and reliable
method that has been used by researchers examining
airlift bioreactors [18]. The measured gas holdups were
corrected
for
the
inﬂuence
of
water
velocity
by
subtracting the velocity head. These corrections ranged
between 5 and 14 percent of the measured gas holdup.
Over the range of air ﬂow rates studied, water velocity in
the riser tube varied between 0.4 and 1.2 m s1, while
gas-phase holdup in the riser tube varied between 2.6
and 4.4 percent.
In addition to the tests where air was supplied to the
riser only, two sets of additional water ﬂow rate
experiments were conducted with a portion of the riser
air ﬂow diverted to the auxiliary diffusers in the
downcomers. During these two additional tests, con-
stant air ﬂow rates (0.044 and 0.062 Nm3 s1) were
delivered to the entire aerator with varying, but equal
amounts of the ﬂow directed to each downcomer
diffuser.
2.3. Laboratory equipment and methods
Bubble size was measured in a large cylindrical tank
located at Tennessee Valley Authority’s engineering
laboratory [6]. The height of the tank was 14 m with an
internal diameter of 2.1 m. A water depth of 10 m was
used during the tests to simulate ﬁeld conditions. The
tank was equipped with transparent portholes that
allowed visual observations to be made during the
experiments. During the bubble-size measurements,
compressed air was supplied to a diffuser mounted
inside the tank. The laboratory diffuser was essentially
the same as the ﬁeld unit. The diffuser unit rested on the
tank bottom approximately 0.36 m behind the lowest

porthole. The porthole immediately above the lowest
porthole was used to collect data because individual
bubbles did not form immediately at the oriﬁces due to
jets of air caused by a very high air ﬂow rate per oriﬁce.
Photographs were used to determine the equivalent
diameter of individual bubbles and the Sauter-mean
diameter
of
the
bubble
swarm,
as
described
by
McGinnis and Little [6].
3. Oxygen transfer and water ﬂow rate model
For the purposes of model development the following
assumptions were made: the diffusers produce bubbles
at a constant rate and evenly distribute these over the
cross section of the riser. The energy introduced by the
gas as it enters the riser water is negligible. Both water
and gas bubbles are in plug ﬂow, with negligible
hydrodynamic dispersion. Bubble coalescence is ne-
glected, and the number ﬂux of bubbles remains
constant throughout the riser. The initial conditions
are obtained from the properties of lake water at the
aerator intake. Mass transfer of gases other than
nitrogen or oxygen is neglected. The water temperature,
air
temperature,
and
volumetric
water
ﬂow
rate
are all constant, and the entire system is at a steady
state. The bubbles are in thermodynamic equilibrium
with the water. The ﬂow of water and bubbles from the
riser is divided equally between the two downcomers,
after accounting for bubble loss to the atmosphere. If
the upward bubble-rise velocity in the downcomers is
equal to or greater than the downward water velocity,
then gas holdup in the downcomers is considered
negligible and no oxygen transfer occurs in the down-
comers.
3.1. Oxygen transfer rate
The oxygen transfer model for the airlift aerator is
based on the discrete-bubble model [6]. The model
focuses on individual bubbles rising in water and
accounts for changes in bubble size due to decreasing
hydrostatic pressure as well as mass transfer of oxygen
and nitrogen across the bubble surface. The local bubble
size determines the local bubble-rise velocity and mass-
transfer coefﬁcient. The partial pressure of gas within
the bubbles is recalculated as the bubbles pass through
the system. To determine the mass-transfer ﬂux per unit
height, the number ﬂux of bubbles, N; is used. The
number ﬂux is calculated from the initial bubble radius,
initial volumetric gas ﬂow rate, and diffuser depth. The
number of bubbles per unit height is found by dividing
the number ﬂux by the bubble velocity relative to the
walls of the riser (vL þ vb), where vL is the actual liquid
velocity and vb is the bubble rise velocity. The mass of
gas transferred per unit height is then obtained by
multiplying the number of bubbles per unit height, the
surface area of a single bubble, and the local mass-
transfer ﬂux, or

where KLi is the liquid-side mass-transfer coefﬁcient, Hi

the bulk aqueous-phase concentration, and r is the
bubble radius. The subscript i refers to the two
molecular species of interest, oxygen and nitrogen.

where Ar is the cross-sectional area of the riser. A

with a mass ﬂux of gaseous species deﬁned as
MGi ¼ ArðvL þ vbÞYi ðmol s1Þ;
ð5Þ
where Yi is the gas-phase concentration.
The mass ﬂux equation for the gas phase contains the
bubble velocity relative to the riser walls, whereas
the ﬂux equation for the dissolved phase contains only
the water velocity. Applying the mass ﬂux equations to
each phase and to each molecular species of interest
(oxygen and nitrogen) yields a set of four differential
equations. Correlation equations for the mass-transfer
coefﬁcient,
Henry’s
law
constant,
and
bubble-rise
velocity are given in McGinnis and Little [6], while
Table 2 provides the required equations of state.
In addition to being used for the riser, the model
equations were extended to predict oxygen transfer in
the downcomer. Oxygen transfer occurs in the down-
comers because of carry-over of bubbles from the riser.
The conservation and state equations used for the
downcomers are identical to those applied to the riser.
However, calculation of the number ﬂux of bubbles in
the downcomers takes into account ﬂow splitting and
bubble loss to the atmosphere. The fraction of bubbles
lost (FL) as the dispersion travels across the air–water
separator is estimated from
FL ¼ vb

where vt is the effective water velocity in the top section

riser to each of the downcomers is also calculated.
Oxygen transfer in this region is due to contact with the
atmosphere. The mass-transfer ﬂux (Jt) of oxygen into
the water at the top of the aerator is
Jt ¼ KLtðCs  CtÞ
ðmol m2 s1Þ;
ð7Þ
where
KLt
is the
surface
liquid-side
mass-transfer
coefﬁcient, Cs is the DO saturation concentration at
the surface, and Ct is the bulk DO concentration in the
top section. Using Eq. (7) to determine the change in the
DO concentration in the top section and rearranging,
the ﬁnal DO concentration when the ﬂow reaches the
end of the separator (Cf) is given by
Cf ¼
KLtAt
Qt þ KLtAt


Cs þ C0
ðmol m3Þ;
ð8Þ
where At is the surface area of the water in contact with
the atmosphere, Qt is the water ﬂow rate through the top
section, and C0 is the initial DO concentration. In
deriving this equation, the average DO concentration of
the water was used in determining the mass ﬂux of
oxygen from the atmosphere.
Because the mass-transfer coefﬁcient for the top
section was not known, it was calculated from the
experimental data. The initial DO concentration was
assumed to be equal to the experimental value at the top
of the riser. For each test, the ﬁnal DO concentration
was set equal to the average of the measured concentra-
tions at the top of each downcomer. In this way, a single
mass-transfer
coefﬁcient
was
determined
for
each
experiment. These were plotted as a function of the
applied air ﬂow rate, and a linear regression was
obtained:
KLt ¼ 0:017 þ 0:21QG
ðm s1Þ;
ð9Þ
where QG is the applied gas ﬂow rate (Nm3 s1). Eq. (9)
is only valid for this speciﬁc airlift aerator and for air
ﬂow rates in the range of 0.018–0.063 Nm3 s1. The R2
value of the linear regression was relatively low at 0.52.
Before the model can be solved, the initial conditions
at the inlet of the riser tube must be determined. The
initial values of the dissolved oxygen and dissolved
nitrogen concentrations are assumed to be equal to the
ambient water conditions at the depth of the diffuser.
The initial ﬂuxes for these components are determined
by multiplying their initial actual concentrations by the
actual initial water velocity and the riser cross-sectional
area. The gaseous oxygen and nitrogen ﬂuxes are
calculated from the air input rate and the initial mole
fraction of each molecular species. The initial gas holdup
is determined from the initial gaseous species concentra-
tion, total pressure, and temperature. The number ﬂux
of bubbles is obtained from the air input rate, initial
bubble size, and total pressure. The water and gas
temperatures are set equal to the ambient lake tempera-
ture at the depth of the diffuser.
The mass ﬂux equations are solved using the standard
Euler method. The equations are ﬁrst integrated using
the initial values. Next, the equations of state are
calculated for the partial pressure of oxygen and
nitrogen (PO and PN; respectively) and the bubble
radius (r). Lastly, the remaining parameters required for
the model are determined: bubble-rise velocity (vb),
mass-transfer coefﬁcients (KLO and KLN), and Henry’s
constants (HO and HN). The mass-transfer terms are
then computed and used to obtain the change in the
mass ﬂuxes over a small increment in the vertical
coordinate. The new mass ﬂuxes are used as the initial
conditions for the next step, and the process is repeated
until the computation reaches the top of the riser. When
the calculation reaches the top of the riser, the overall
gas holdup in the riser is determined by averaging the
individual gas holdup values for each increment of the
vertical coordinate.
Oxygen transfer in the air–water separator is esti-
mated from Eqs. (8) and (9). The water ﬂow rate in the
top section is equal to half of that in the riser. The
surface area for mass transfer with the atmosphere is set
equal to one-half of the separator plan area. The initial
DO concentration is equivalent to the value calculated
by the model for the top of the riser dispersion.
The same procedure used in the riser is applied to
determine oxygen transfer in the downcomers. The
iteration begins at the top of the downcomer. The initial
conditions are determined from the dissolved species
concentrations and the gaseous species mole fractions
after oxygen transfer has been accounted for in the

outlet of the downcomer is reached.
3.2. Water ﬂow rate
The water ﬂow rate model presented in this paper is
based on the model developed by Del Vecchio and Little
[15], but adapted to the design of LPA1. The main
equations for the model come from literature on airlift
bioreactors [18]. The water ﬂow rate model is based
upon a steady-state macroscopic energy balance over the
entire aerator. The rate of energy input due to gas ﬂow is
equal to the rate of energy dissipation due to ﬂuid ﬂow
[20]. As will be discussed later, experiments showed that
for this particular aerator design and range of air ﬂow
rates, the gas holdup in the downcomers does not
signiﬁcantly impact the overall induced water ﬂow rate.
Therefore, terms that are a function of downcomer gas
holdup were assumed to be zero, resulting in the
following abbreviated energy balance:
EI ¼ EW þ EF þ EE þ Et;
ð10Þ
where EI is the energy input due to isothermal gas
expansion [18], EW is the energy dissipation due to
wakes created by the bubbles in the riser [20], EF is the
energy loss due to wall friction in the riser and
downcomer [21,22], and EE is the standard energy loss
due to local disturbances in the ﬂow (entrance and exit).
The entrance and exit loss coefﬁcients were estimated
from correlations presented in Fried and Idelchick [23]
as 1.40 (entrance into a straight circular tube through
two side oriﬁces) and 1.50 (exit from a tube onto a
bafﬂe), respectively. These friction loss coefﬁcients are
assumed to be applicable to the airlift aerator because
gas holdup was always less than 5 percent. Et; the energy
loss due to ﬂuid turn-around and friction at the top of
the riser, is deﬁned [18] as
ET ¼ 1
2 rLv3
LrKtArð1  erÞ;
ð11Þ
where Kt is the loss coefﬁcient for the top portion, or
air–water separator, of the aerator.
The aerator design and dimensions were available,
and the actual water velocity, riser gas holdup, and
water temperature were measured at each applied air
ﬂow rate. The only unknown with respect to the water
ﬂow rate model was Kt; the loss coefﬁcient for the top
section of the aerator.
4. Results and discussion
Using the measured water ﬂow rate and temperature,
a least-squares analysis was performed to ﬁnd the DO
proﬁle that provided the best ﬁt to the experimental
data. The calculation was accomplished by varying the
initial bubble size, the only unknown in the oxygen
transfer model. The measured data and best-ﬁt model
proﬁles are given in Fig. 3. The model reproduces the
oxygen concentration proﬁles well over the entire range
of experimental air ﬂow rates. The data tend to show an
initial rapid transfer of oxygen to the water in the
bottom portion of the riser tube. According to Clift et al.
[24], the increased mass-transfer rate may be due to high
internal gas circulation during bubble formation as well
as the presence of newly formed, contaminant-free
bubble surfaces. Also, during bubble release, mass-
transfer rates may be increased due to oscillations and
bubble acceleration [24]. Research also suggests that a
high water velocity may increase the local mass-transfer
coefﬁcient [25].
Because the downcomer DO proﬁles were not used in
the model ﬁts, they were predicted starting with the
bubble diameter at the top of the riser as determined by
the model. The downcomer predictions are also shown
in Fig. 3. The model and experimental proﬁles are nearly
linear with very similar slopes. The model performs
somewhat better at the higher air ﬂow rates, which is
most likely the result of error in the estimation of oxygen
transfer in the air–water separator at the lower air ﬂow
rates. The error affects the initial dissolved oxygen
concentration used to determine the downcomer proﬁle.
Fig. 4 shows the initial bubble diameters that pro-
vided the best ﬁt of the model to the riser data and the
corresponding experimentally measured Sauter-mean
diameters [6,26]. The measured values were obtained
from two independent sets of tests over the entire range
of air ﬂow rates. The values calculated by the model and
those measured during the laboratory experiments
appear to be relatively independent of applied air ﬂow
rate, an effect also observed by Ashley et al. [27]. The
range of ﬁtted initial bubble diameters is 2.3–3.1 mm,
and the range of experimentally observed diameters is
2.7–3.9 mm. One possible cause for the discrepancy
between measured and calculated values is the difference
in hydrodynamic conditions between the ﬁeld and the
laboratory tests. In the airlift aerators, the induced water
ﬂow rate was much higher than in the tank tests. This
would tend to produce greater shear forces and hence,
smaller bubbles.
Fig. 4 also shows the standard deviations for each of
the measured bubble diameters. All of the calculated
bubble sizes, with the exception of one at the lowest air
ﬂow rate, fall within one standard deviation of the
measured
values.
The
standard
deviations
of
the
measured bubble sizes indicate that the assumption of
uniform bubble size may be invalid. However, a
modeling analysis was performed using a bubble size
distribution instead of a single value, and the predicted
oxygen
concentrations
did
not
differ
signiﬁcantly
from those obtained using the Sauter-mean bubble
diameter. A similar result was obtained when using the
V.L. Burris et al. / Water Research 36 (2002) 4605–4615
4611

discrete-bubble model to predict diffused-bubble oxygen
transfer in a large well-mixed tank [6].
Riser gas holdup is also estimated using the bubble
diameters calculated from the riser DO proﬁles. The
predicted results are compared to experimental values in
Fig. 5. Good agreement is obtained between measured
and predicted gas holdup, with nearly all of the
predicted values falling within 720% of the observed.
Fig. 6 shows that induced water ﬂow rate increases
linearly as the applied riser air ﬂow rate is increased. As
previously mentioned, two additional sets of experi-
ments were conducted with a portion of the air ﬂow
diverted to the auxiliary diffusers in the downcomers. As
shown in Fig. 6, all the experimental data follow the
same trend, independent of the amount of air that was
applied to the downcomer diffusers. These results show
that, for this particular aerator design and range of air
ﬂow rates, the gas holdup in the downcomers does not

signiﬁcantly impact the overall induced water ﬂow rate.
The induced water ﬂow rate and measured riser gas
holdup for each applied air ﬂow rate were used to
explicitly calculate the terms EI; EW; EF; and EE in
Eq. (10). The value of Kt was then adjusted to obtain a
value for Et that exactly balanced the equation. Table 3
provides the results of the energy balance calculations.
The wall friction loss term, EF; is small relative to all the
other terms, being less than 2 percent of the energy
input. The analysis also reveals the importance of the
other frictional loss terms, Et and EE; in establishing the
induced water ﬂow rate, suggesting that attention should
be given to these features during aerator design to obtain
the optimal water ﬂow rate.
Fig. 7 shows the calculated friction coefﬁcients that
provided the best ﬁt of the model to the experimental
water
velocity
data.
Fig. 7
also
reveals
that
loss
coefﬁcients for the top section are higher at the lower
superﬁcial water velocities. The results may be explained
by small (about 13 cm high) weir-like structures at the
top of the riser tube, which were installed by the
manufacturer to measure water ﬂow rate. They were
constructed of the same thin ﬁberglass sheets as used for
the riser and downcomers, and resemble thin-plate
weirs. The weirs are located on both sides of the riser
between the riser and the downcomer, and span the
entire width of the top section of the aerator. At low
water velocities, the ﬂow approximated true weir ﬂow.
At higher velocities, however, the ﬂow did not resemble
weir ﬂow because of the lack of a deﬁned nappe. The
structures therefore appear to have a greater impact on
the water ﬂow rate at the lower velocities. At the higher
water velocities, the weirs acted merely as small ﬂow
obstructions.

function of water velocity, with an R2 value of 0.92

performance. They assumed that since the top and
bottom sections of an external-loop reactor have similar
geometries, the loss coefﬁcients are approximately equal.
They noted that despite widely varying reactor dimen-
sions, the value of the loss coefﬁcient for the bottom
section is within a range deﬁned by the reactors utilized
by Onken and Weiland [28], Bello [29], and Merchuk
and Stein [22]. Chisti et al. [21] assumed an average value
for the top and bottom loss coefﬁcients of 5.5. Referring
to Fig. 7, the airlift aerator correlation predicts results
similar to the Chisti et al. [21] value at intermediate
superﬁcial water velocities. At low water velocities, the
airlift aerator results deviate from the Chisti et al. [21]
coefﬁcient value. The difference may be due to the weirs
in the top section of the aerator as previously described.
5. Summary and conclusions
Data from an airlift aerator were collected over a wide
range of applied air ﬂow rates. Dissolved oxygen
concentration proﬁles, water ﬂow rates, and gas holdup
were measured. A discrete-bubble model was applied to
the airlift aerator. By varying a single parameter (the
initial bubble size) the model was found to provide a
close ﬁt to the experimental DO proﬁles as well as good
agreement with the observed gas holdup in the riser.
Within experimental precision, the bubble sizes calcu-
lated using the model agree with the Sauter-mean
diameters measured in laboratory experiments. The
model was also extended to account for oxygen transfer
in the air–water separator and to predict, a priori, the
DO proﬁles in the downcomers. The model output again
compares well with the experimental data. These results
represent a useful advance in the understanding of
oxygen transfer in airlift aerators and, because of the
fundamental nature of the model, suggest that this
approach may be applied to other types of oxygenation
devices.
Operation of the downcomer diffusers had almost no
impact on the measured water ﬂow rate in the riser. This
allowed an abbreviated energy-balance model to be
applied to the airlift aerator. By varying a single
parameter (the frictional loss coefﬁcient of the air–water
separator) the model was found to provide results
similar to those obtained in external-loop airlift bior-
eactors. These results support the use of an energy-
balance approach to determine water ﬂow rate in airlift
aerators. However, additional research is required to
verify the general applicability of the energy-balance
model and to extend the model to other full- and partial-
lift airlift aerator designs.

A steady state bubble-plume model is evaluated using full-scale temperature, salinity,
and dissolved oxygen data collected in a Swiss lake. The data revealed a plume-generated
near-field environment that differed significantly from the ambient far-field water column
properties. A near-field torus of reduced stratification developed around the plume, the
extent of which is on the same lateral scale as the horizontal dislocations generated by
persistent first-mode seiching. The plume fallback water was found to penetrate much
deeper than expected, thereby maintaining reduced vertical gradients in the near-field
torus. The plume entrains a portion of the fallback water leading to short-circuiting, which
generates a complex plume-lake interaction and reduces far-field downwelling relative to
the upward plume flow. As the integral plume model incorporates the entrainment
hypothesis, it is highly sensitive to the near-field environmental conditions. After
identifying appropriate near-field boundary conditions the plume model predictions agree
well with the field observations.

Introduction
[2] Excess phosphorous loading in lakes and reservoirs
increases the content of organic matter, which, through
decomposition, increases oxygen demand. Many eutrophic
lakes do not contain sufficient hypolimnetic dissolved
oxygen (DO) to meet this demand during the stratified
season and become anoxic before the advent of deepwater
convection in winter [Beutel and Horne, 1999]. As a result,
anoxic products such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, ammo-
nia, iron, manganese, and phosphorus are formed [Ga¨chter
and Mu¨ller, 2003]. These conditions cause environmental
and drinking water treatment problems, which vary depend-
ing on the water use. For drinking water sources, water
depleted of DO may lead to taste and odor problems,
increased treatment costs, and increased formation of dis-
infection by-products [Cooke et al., 1993]. For cold-water
fisheries, low hypolimnetic DO stresses or eradicates fish
populations, and eggs deposited in anoxic sediments may
not develop. Hypoxia itself has been shown to be an
endocrine disruptor and negatively impacts fish reproduc-
tion [Wu et al., 2003]. Anoxic reservoir releases also
negatively impact downstream water quality [Beutel and
Horne, 1999]. Preventing the occurrence of anoxia in the
hypolimnion may be achieved with oxygenating bubble-
plumes [Wu¨est et al., 1992] or other oxygenation systems
such as the Speece Cone [McGinnis and Little, 1998] or
airlift aerator [Burris et al., 2002].
[3] The advantage of hypolimnetic oxygenation is the
ability to replenish DO while preserving thermal stratifica-
tion [Nakamura and Inoue, 1996; Beutel and Horne, 1999].
Bubble-plume diffusers inject air or oxygen with a relatively
weak gas flow rate using small (<2 mm diameter) bubbles
[Wu¨est et al., 1992; McGinnis and Little, 2002]. This
application lends itself to deeper lakes where the bulk of
the bubbles dissolve in the hypolimnion, and the plume
momentum is small enough to prevent intrusion into the
thermocline, which would otherwise lead to warming of the
hypolimnion [Wu¨est et al., 1992]. Penetration of phospho-
rus-laden plume water into the photic zone can also fuel
further algal growth. Minimizing these potential problems
requires better understanding of the performance of bubble
plumes. In addition, the plume-lake interaction, particularly
in the near field, may play a significant role in determining
plume behavior.
[4] No thorough full-scale studies have been undertaken
to investigate plume-lake interactions. While many bubble-
plume models have been developed, most were tested in
laboratory settings [McDougall, 1978; Asaeda and Imberger,
1993; Borchers et al., 1999; Brevik and Kristiansen, 2002]
or in limited in situ studies [Wu¨est et al., 1992; Lemckert
and Imberger, 1993; Mobley, 1997; Johnson et al., 2000].
Previous models typically assume steady state conditions
and do not account for short- and long-term temporal and
spatial alteration of the density structure or water quality
with the associated change in plume dynamics. Such

changes may result from seasonal (climatic) warming and
cooling, reservoir operation (withdrawal), inflow, seiching,
and more importantly for this study, the plume-lake interac-
tion itself.
[5] This paper demonstrates that a more complex plume-
lake interaction exists than generally assumed and that
knowledge of this interaction is necessary to correctly
simulate plume dynamics, oxygen transfer efficiency, and
associated large-scale transport phenomena. Using a com-
bination of field measurements and modeling we (1) study
the bubble-plume and the plume-lake interaction, (2) deter-
mine from the data and model the appropriate boundary
conditions, and (3) use the new understanding of the plume
behavior in a full-scale validation of the Wu¨est et al. [1992]
bubble-plume model.
2.
Bubble-Plume Model
[6] Figure 1 shows the conventional concept of a bubble-
plume in a lake. A model that predicts hydrodynamics and
constituent concentrations in these circular bubble-plumes is
investigated. The plume model theory is based on horizon-
tally integrated equations of the conservation of mass,
momentum, heat, salinity and gas species [McDougall,
1978]. Entrainment is assumed proportional to the local
plume velocity and circumference [Morton, 1959]. The
plume model also includes the effects of stratification due
to vertical temperature and salinity gradients. A key contri-
bution of the Wu¨est et al. [1992] model was the use of a
variable buoyancy flux to account for changing bubble size
not only due to decompression and thermal expansion, but
also gas dissolution and stripping. While previous studies
neglected gas exchange, it is particularly important in deep
systems, or for weak plumes, where gas transfer can be
rapid. The model also uses bubble-size-dependent equations
for bubble rise velocity and mass transfer coefficients,
as well as a temperature-dependent solubility constant
(Table 1). The gas transfer component of the plume model
has been independently validated in discrete-bubble oxygen
transfer tests [McGinnis and Little, 2002], and in a full-scale
airlift aerator [Burris et al., 2002].
[7] Table 2 lists the key variables of the plume model. On
the basis of eight flux equations (Table 3) that are solved
simultaneously, the model predicts water flow rate, water
entrainment, gas transfer, plume temperature, constituent
concentrations (oxygen, nitrogen and salinity), depth of
maximum plume rise (DMPR), and equilibrium depth
(ED) for the given boundary conditions of diffuser depth
and diameter, applied gas flow rate, initial bubble size, and
boundary profiles (temperature, DO, and salinity). The
initial velocity is determined on the basis of a Froude
number of 1.6 [Wu¨est et al., 1992], where

ture is assumed to be equal to the radius b of the top hat
plume velocity profile, while the bubbles occupy an inner
core of radius, lb (l < 1). The bubble diffuser source is
assumed to produce bubbles at a constant rate and uniform
size that are evenly distributed over the entire diffuser, lbo.
Bubble coalescence is neglected. The properties of water
entrained into the plume are assumed equal to the ambient
water at that depth.
3.
Research Approach
[8] To fully validate the plume model, it is necessary to
experimentally resolve the appropriate boundary condi-
tions, determine the DMPR and in-plume constituent
distributions, verify the entrainment coefficient, and better
quantify the plume fallback behavior and plume-lake
interaction. Entrainment resulting in plume spreading is
typically treated as a constant, an assumption that is
somewhat counterintuitive given the variable nature of
the plume boundary conditions. These include changes in
plume velocity resulting in different levels of turbulence
at the plume/ambient water interface, the variation in
density gradient, and mixing that may occur in the region
where the plume stops rising. Furthermore, the spreading
(or lack of spreading) of the bubble core resulting from
entrainment affects the DMPR and the constituent
concentration distributions in the plume (i.e., Gaussian
versus top hat). The near-field detrainment and behavior
of the plume return flow, or fallback water, is not fully
understood and is an area that is typically weakly
addressed, but which may have significant impact on
the plume itself [Asaeda and Imberger, 1993; Lemckert
and Imberger, 1993; Brevik and Kristiansen, 2002]. The
far-field response to the plume entrainment (inflow) and
detrainment (return flow) is also unclear, and will affect
the ultimate location of oxygenated water in the lake and
long-term changes in plume characteristics.
[9] The in situ study was undertaken in Lake Hallwil, a
medium-sized lake located on the Swiss Plateau (Figure 2
and Table 4) [Sto¨ckli and Schmid, 1987; Scheidegger et al.,
1994]. Lake Hallwil is a phosphorous-limited, eutrophic lake
that has experienced anoxia during the summer for the past
century. In 1986, the ‘‘Tanytarsus’’ diffuser system (Figure 3)
was installed to combat anoxia and as an ultimate restoration
technique [Sto¨ckli and Schmid, 1987; Wehrli and Wu¨est,
1996]. The system can be switched between artificial mixing
mode using coarse air bubbles, and hypolimnetic oxygena-
tion or aeration mode using fine oxygen or air bubbles,
respectively. The six 6.5-m diameter diffusers in Lake
Hallwil are in a 300-m diameter circular configuration near
the center of the lake (Figure 2 and Table 4). Each diffuser is
operated using air or oxygen during the summer, and air for
artificial mixing in the winter. Table 5 shows the air and
oxygen flow rates employed in 2001 and 2002.
[10] To establish appropriate boundary conditions for the
plume model, high spatial resolution of the near-plume
environment is required. The lake monitoring and testing

program began in April 2001. Measurements focused on the
entire lake response to hypolimnetic oxygenation in 2001
and the near-field plume environment in 2002. During
2001, transects were measured weekly to monthly at
18 locations along the main axis of Lake Hallwil (Figure 2)
using a SeaBird SBE19 CTD profiler. The SBE19 samples at
2 Hz and measures, besides conductivity, temperature and
depth (CTD), also DO, light transmission (at 660 nm) and
pH. In 2002, spatially high resolution (1–2 m) transects
were obtained across an individual plume. Ropes were fixed
on the water surface using existing heavy-duty buoys as well
as anchors. A floating rope was placed directly over a single
plume and the position of the rope was verified using GPS
with no observed movement. A total of 32 profiles were
measured, with the 0-m point located above what visually
appeared to be the center of the plume. Profiles were
measured every meter between 0 and 10 m and every 2 m
between 10 and 20 m, with the transect extending in both
directions from the center of the plume.
[11] During the monitoring program, two thermistor
moorings were deployed 100 m from the diffuser ring
(M1) and on the north end of Lake Hallwil (M2)
(Figure 2). Although the thermistor configuration and type
varied during the study, deployment was nearly continuous.
The thermistors were high-resolution Richard Branker TR-
1000 and TR-1050 as well as 8- and 12-bit Vemco Minilog
sensors. Additionally, an RD Instruments Workhorse ADCP
(acoustic Doppler current profiler, referred to as ‘‘RDI’’)
(600 kHz) was deployed on the bottom of the lake facing
upward. The current profiler was positioned near the dif-
fuser ring at M1 (Figure 2) throughout most of the study and
measured the three-dimensional velocity vectors. For a
typical deployment, the RDI was configured to measure
velocity profiles throughout the entire water column within
50-cm vertical bins. Profiles were recorded every 5 min as
averages over 150 individual pings.

Plume-Induced Near-Field Environment
[12] The plume and its near field were probed at a high
spatial resolution. Figures 4–6 show high-resolution con-
tour plots for temperature, DO and light transmission on
18 July 2002, when the diffuser was operating with air at
180 Nm3 h1, corresponding to 1.3 t-O2 d1 (Table 5). From
the contour plots, the plume appears highly turbulent and
fairly heterogeneous in nature. The high-resolution temper-
ature contour plot (Figure 4) indicates an approximately
Gaussian distribution as expected. The DMPR is 7.5 m with

the average of 9.4 m taken at the 7C contour line. Multiple
detrainments occur in the northerly (left) direction, as
indicated by the temperature, DO, and light transmission
data (Figures 4–6). Such detrainment is probably the result
of horizontal advective cross flow due to internal seiching
(discussed in section 4.2). The depression in the temperature
isopleths and the higher DO that plunges almost to the lake
bottom immediately to the north (left in Figures 4–6) of the
plume is a result of either detrained water that passes the ED
due to momentum or local drawdown resulting from plume
upflow.
[13] Within the plume, the DO concentration is substan-
tially lower than in the ambient lake water (Figure 5). The
reason is that the plume initially entrains water from the
anoxic bottom boundary layer and the DO increase in
the rising plume due to gas transfer from the air bubbles
(instead of oxygen) is modest. Under these conditions, the
DO concentration within the plume is governed by the
initial conditions at the diffuser and entrainment of sur-
rounding water. The low-transmissivity spikes within the
plume shown in Figure 6 are also of interest. These spikes
are a result of bubbles passing the light transmission meter,
suggesting the location of the bubble core. The lines super-
imposed on Figure 6 indicate the extent of the bubble core,
which appears to spread only slightly. The bubbles are
rising approximately 25 cm s1 faster than the plume water
[McGinnis and Little, 2002], making them less subject to
spreading due to entrainment as there is considerably less
bubble contact time. While not conclusive, this almost
nonexpanding bubble core agrees with the laboratory obser-
vations of McDougall [1978], while the bubble-plume
model assumes the bubble core expands in width at the
same rate as the outer core. The more concentrated bubble
core will result in a higher local DMPR than the top hat
assumption, or even a Gaussian profile, would yield. This
issue will be addressed subsequently.

the plume was operated using pure oxygen at the flow rates
listed in Table 5. The typical, two-dimensional nature of the
mushroom-shaped plume is clearly depicted in the oxygen
contours. The nearly 1-km-wide depression of the isotherms
in the deep central region between 25 and 40 m indicates the
presence of warmer water, while the slightly convex iso-
therms in the shallower region indicate cooler water, dem-
onstrating the impact of the six circular plumes on the
hypolimnion. The 1-km-wide near-field plume-induced
structure is a result of seiching, as explained below.
[15] The persistent warmer water at lower depths in the
seiche-enhanced near field may be explained by plume
water fallback from either detrainment at the top of the
plume, detrainment along the rising plume (multiple
detrainment), or a combination of both. It was surprising
to observe plume fallback water at depths lower then the
estimated ED or point of neutral buoyancy. This could also
occur because of multiple detrainments, with some denser
plume water detraining lower down in the plume. It is
further hypothesized that after the higher than ambient
density plume water detrains at the DMPR, momentum
carries the fallback water past the point of neutral buoyancy
and toward the lake bottom before finally rising again to the
ED, which is estimated to be between 20 and 30 m based on
the temperature and DO structures shown in Figures 7 and
8, respectively. This oscillation can be described by the
local buoyancy frequency, N. This phenomenon was also
observed, although to a lesser extent, by Lemckert and
Imberger [1993].
[16] A direct observation of the maximum fallback depth
was acquired from the ADCP velocity measurements in
June 2002 (Figure 9). For this purpose, the ADCP was
bottom deployed (facing upward) on the north side of the
diffuser ring approximately 30 m from the most northerly
diffuser (Figure 2). The contour plot in Figure 9 shows
the measured downward velocity (upward velocity is
positive). There were no significant upward velocities
measured during this period, and for clarity the low values
were omitted from the plot. Downward velocities reached
18 mm s1, much higher than typical vertical velocities in
a lake interior [Wu¨est and Lorke, 2003], and were observed as
deep as 40 m. This observation is significant because, as the
plume rises, it entrains a large fraction of the fallback
water, which has different properties than in the far field,
and results in short-circuiting of the detraining plume water.
[17] Although the applied gas flow rate was constant, the
observed downward velocities show a regular periodicity
(Figure 9), which we interpret as the result of plume
wandering due to basin-scale internal (baroclinic) seiching
of the lake water body (Figure 10). As previously men-
tioned, this internal seiching motion explains the horizontal
dispersion of the plume ‘‘signature.’’ As indicated on the
temperature and DO contour plots (Figures 7 and 8),
the horizontal extent of the seiche-induced zone (higher
temperature and DO) at the lower depths is approximately
1 km wide and slightly shifted to the north (right on
Figures 7 and 8). This is substantially larger than would
be expected for the six individual plumes arranged in a
300-m-diameter ring in quiescent water. Owing to the
geometry of the basin and a 24-hour wind forcing, rather
intense and persistent first-mode seiching occurs, typically
with a period of approximately 12 hours (Figure 10)
[Gwaze, 2003]. The hypolimnetic seiche currents are sinu-
soidal with an amplitude of 3.5 cm s1 and an average
current velocity of 1 cm s1 during June and July 2001
(Figure 10). The distance this water moves at 1 (3.5) cm s1

over a 6-hour period is 220 (750) m, and thus seiching can
significantly increase the horizontal dispersion of the local-
ized plume signature. These observations further support the
hypothesis that the plume generates a near-field environ-
ment, which strongly affects the plume hydrodynamics and
constituent concentrations.
4.3.
Compensation Flow in the Far Field
[18] Depending on operating conditions, a large portion
of plume fallback water may be re-entrained by the plume,
leading to short-circuiting. The traditional and new concep-
tualized plume flow patterns are shown in Figure 11. The
far-field vertical compensation flow was calculated by
balancing temperature in layers at different depths. The
respective temporal and vertical gradients were determined
using the high-resolution thermistor data collected at the
mooring installed 100 m north of the diffuser ring (M1 on
Figure 2). The horizontally averaged vertical far-field trans-
port is given by

(positive Q implies upward advective transport). To ensure
the validity of this calculation, it was first necessary to
determine the relative magnitude of the plume-induced
mixing (apparent vertical turbulent diffusivity) with respect
to the natural turbulent diffusivity. The apparent hypolim-
netic turbulent diffusivity was calculated [Powell and
Jassby, 1974] by

for both the 13–30 July 2001 and May–June 2002 data and
found to be in the range of 0.16–17 cm2 s1. This range is
much higher than the vertical diffusivity of approximately
0.03 cm2 s1 reported for Lake Alpnach, a Swiss lake with
similar size and stronger wind exposure but with no
hypolimnetic oxygenation system [Wu¨est et al., 2000].
Therefore the vertical transport induced by the plume is
much greater than naturally occurring vertical turbulent
diffusivity, so the latter can be considered negligible in the
plume-affected hypolimnion. The predicted far-field plume
entrainment flow rate at each depth was then estimated by
calculating the expected vertical divergence @Q/@z of the
far-field transport from the plume model. This was directly
compared to the observed far-field advective transport, as
any water entrained by the upward plume at a particular
depth below the ED should result in an equal amount

flowing downward in the far field to replace it. These
estimates neglect possible mixing at the DMPR and
entrainment during plume fallback.
[19] Figure 12 shows the observed far-field advective
transport with depth compared to the predicted plume
transport for the 13–30 July 2001 thermistor data. The
plume was operated using oxygen at 80% of the June 2002
airflow rate (Table 5). The model underpredicts the
DMPR due to the improper selection of boundary profiles;
however, the predicted water flow rate below the ED is
close to the calculated range. For July 2001, while the shape
of the observed and predicted curves do not match closely
(discussed below), the averaged integrated total flow below
the minimum flow at 31 m for both the measured and
predicted curves is within 10%. The zero far-field flow at
23 m is thought to be the upper extent of the ED with the
bottom extent at around 31 m, immediately above the
minimum calculated Q of 60 m3 s1. The zero far-field
flow at 16 m is thought to be the average DMPR over
the 18-day period, as entrainment, and hence a far-field
response does not occur above this point. This DMPR,
however, is well below the lower extent (10 m) of the
thermocline, which prevents the entrainment of warmer,
metalimnetic water. The depth from 16 to 23 m shows a
cooling, or upward flow, of water (Figure 11), similar
to observations during laboratory tests performed by
McDougall [1978] for weak plumes. This upward flow is
a result of plume entrainment removing water above the
ED (with additional water entrained during fallback) and
placing it in the region of the ED. This suggests a weaker,
well-defined plume and perhaps only a single detrainment at
the top, limiting any short-circuiting to the zone above the
lower extent of the ED.
[20] The same analysis was performed on the May–June
2002 data when a stronger plume was operated with air at
180 Nm3 h1 (Figure 12). The observed far-field advective
flow is significantly lower than that estimated from the
plume model, with a nearly Gaussian distribution in the
observed flow rate versus depth. Furthermore, the area of
upward advective flow is absent. Two important conclu-
sions can be drawn from these results. The first is that the
observed plume-induced advective far-field flow is much
less than expected on the basis of model predictions, which
is likely a result of re-entrainment of the fallback and
ultimate return water. Second, the considerable underpre-
diction in the observed far-field flow rate points to short-
circuiting at all locations along the plume. These results
suggest either that fallback water is almost reaching the lake
bottom, or that multiple detrainment is occurring (similar to
the observations of McDougall [1978] in lab experiments
for strong plumes), or both.
[21] Finally, there is an alteration in the isotherms near the
plume due to enhanced mixing, with the near-field water
being more vertically homogenous than the far-field temper-
ature structure (Figure 11). That is, the temperature isopleths
are much farther apart near the diffusers and vertically shifted
relative to the far field. Assuming that the bulk advective
transport from the far field occurs along the isopycnals, this
results in a somewhat Gaussian distribution of advective
vertical transport rather than the linearly increasing flow rate
that would be expected if the isotherms were truly horizontal
and unaltered by the plume (see Figure 11). The more
vigorous mixing resulting in the more homogeneous near-
field density structure may also allow the fallback water to
reach greater depths as it encounters weakly stratified water.
Furthermore, because plume detrainment is likely occurring
at multiple points and water is moving toward the plume at
these same locations, return flow from the plumes to the far
field is limited to enhanced turbulent diffusion rather
than advection. Additionally, there is no upward far-field
compensation flow, shown by the lack of a positive Q in
Figure 12, indicating an overall warming of the hypolimnion.
This warming throughout the hypolimnion is due to plume
penetration into and subsequent erosion of the themocline
resulting in a net downward heat flux from the thermocline
and implies a slow destratification of Lake Hallwil.

Model Comparison With Improved
Boundary Conditions
[22] Using the near-field boundary conditions in the
plume model yielded substantial improvements in model
predictions. The results of the simulation are superimposed
on the contour plots (Figures 4–6) showing predicted
diameter as a function of depth and the predicted DMPR.
The new boundary conditions were constructed by averag-
ing the boundary profiles measured 5 m on either side of the
Figure 12.

center of the plume and the simulation was performed using
the baseline values listed in Table 6. Using the indicated
profiles, the plume model predicts both the DMPR and rate
of spread extremely well, given the top hat assumption
versus the actual approximately Gaussian distribution.
Figure 13 shows the averaged measured in-plume tempera-
ture and DO profile and the plume-model predictions. The
predicted temperature profile compares well but appears to
diverge at 20 m depth to approximately 0.3C less than the
measured temperature. This may be a result of the boundary
profiles still being somewhat inaccurate. Depending on the
direction and strength of the horizontal hypolimnetic current
velocities and the plume interaction at stronger temperature
gradients, the plume may entrain and detrain water at
different rates and with different properties around the
plume. Furthermore, the average plume temperature and
DO are based only on the two-dimensional transect and
may also be laterally heterogeneous. In fact, the diffuser
geometry imparts an initial bubble distribution that is
clearly not perfectly uniform (Figure 3). Also, as previously
discussed, the plume boundaries are not well defined
because of inhomogeneity caused by seiching and detrain-
ment (Figures 4–6). The variation in DO around the plume
is also substantial, and selection of improper DO boundary
conditions may have resulted in the slight underprediction of
the DO concentration profile (Figure 13). Using a single
profile for the model calculation is therefore not appropriate
under such heterogeneous boundary conditions.
[23] Figure 14 shows a sensitivity analysis performed
using different boundary profiles along the length of the
transect (x axis indicates distance of boundary profile from
plume centerline). As described above, the plume rises higher
using profiles closest to the center, as the vertical density
structure is more homogeneous. The predicted DMPR deep-
ens sharply with boundary profiles farther than 5 m from the
plume centerline, particularly when using the southerly
profiles, the direction from which the seiche current is
flowing while the transect was measured. The DMPR tends
to stabilize with increasing distance from the diffuser because
of the more uniform structure of the vertical profiles.
[24] The ED is calculated by matching the final density of
the plume water with the density at depth using the
boundary profiles. Variations occur because a small change
in the final density of the plume water at the DMPR can
result in a substantial difference in the ED in the less
stratified bottom water. Also, because the plume encounters
a strong temperature gradient as it stops, a small increase in
predicted plume rise translates into a relatively large change
in the predicted density; that is, the higher the water rises,
the less dense it becomes. It is important to note that the ED
is based only on a density comparison, and that it assumes
no further entrainment as it falls back. The ED predictions
are also less variable with increasing distance from the
plume, and in reality, probably occur over a vertical zone in
the water column because of multiple detrainment, through
flow, and entrainment into the fallback water.
6.
Conclusions
[25] A steady state, horizontally averaged, bubble-plume
model was evaluated on a 1:1 scale using high-resolution
CTD data collected in Lake Hallwil, Switzerland. Observa-
tions of the plume near and far field revealed the following:
[26] 1. The plume-lake interaction was found to be much
more complex than previously believed. The bubble plume
creates its own local environment on two different scales: the
plume torus, where the directly detrained water and fallback
water are accumulated over tens of meters off the plume,
while the seiche-induced near field of the plume reaches up
to 0.5 km in either direction. This distance is governed by the
internal seiche velocities (or other horizontal cross flows)
multiplied by one half the seiche period.
[27] 2. The data show that the plume fallback and mixing
results in a more homogeneous density structure within the
plume torus. This leads to a shallower depth of maximum
plume rise (DMPR), as there is less density gradient to
overcome. To properly model the plume, it is necessary to
select appropriate density boundary conditions.
[28] 3. Using the near-field boundary conditions, rather
than the far-field boundary conditions, produced excellent
agreement, with a shallower DMPR and closer constituent
predictions.

[29] 4. Because a significant portion of entrained plume
water is from the torus, the plume constituents depend
strongly on the near-field environment, which is created
by the plume itself. The plume properties and model
predictions are strongly dependent on these continually
changing boundary conditions.
[30] 5. The data also show that the plume falls back much
deeper than expected from the far-field model predictions,
which leads to considerable short-circuiting of the return
flow and a subsequent reduction in the rate of oxygen
transport to the entire lake. It is unclear whether the deeper
fallback is primarily due to multiple detrainments or the
more isothermal plume torus. This fallback may alter the
entrainment coefficient, currently assumed to be constant,
due to enhanced turbulence at the plume/ambient water
interface.
[31] 6. The bubble core was found not to spread, which
requires particular attention to the interpretation of the
model as the bubble-plume will in reality rise locally higher
than predicted, possibly penetrating into the thermocline or
photic zone. This will also increase the likelihood of
multiple detrainments, as the positive buoyancy flux
imparted by the gas bubbles is not distributed over the
plume outer core.
[32] 7. Because the water flowing from the far field to the
plume travels along the isopycnals, the altered isotherms in
the near field affect where water is withdrawn from the far
field into the plume. Furthermore, as the return flow is along
the same isopycnals, lateral transport is limited to enhanced
horizontal diffusion.
[33] It is evident that a method needs to be developed to
predict the altered near-field, short-circuiting, and fallback
of detrained plume water past the equilibrium depth. One
approach currently being examined is a coupled plume-
reservoir model using an improved plume model and a two-
dimensional reservoir model (CE-QUAL-W2) [Cole and
Wells, 2000]. This coupled model is currently being devel-
oped to predict plume dynamics and the near- and far-field
responses. It may, however, require the addition of a plume
fallback model to adequately predict the transport of water
in the near-field torus. A preliminary version of such a
coupled model for a linear (as opposed to circular) bubble-
plume has been developed and used to predict the evolving
temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations in a small
side-stream reservoir. Once completed, the coupled model
will be used to further investigate the plume models (both
circular and linear) in full-scale lake or reservoir settings
to better understand the plume-lake interaction, plume-
enhanced mixing and warming, and other aspects such as
variation in entrainment and potential nitrogen supersatura-
tion in the case of air. The validated, coupled plume/
reservoir model should also prove to be a valuable tool to
operationally enhance existing systems, to investigate the
effectiveness of bubble-plumes in drinking water reservoirs,
to perform economic optimizations for proposed or existing
installations, and to identify future research needs.

When properly designed, hypolimnetic aeration and
oxygenation systems can replenish dissolved oxygen in
waterbodieswhilepreservingstratification.Thethreeprimary
devices are the airlift aerator, Speece Cone, and bubble-
plume diffuser. In each device, gas bubbles in contact with
water facilitate interfacial transfer of oxygen, nitrogen,
and other soluble gases. However, early design procedures
for airlift aerators were empirical, while most bubble-
plume models did not account for stratification or gas
transfer. Using fundamental principles, a discrete-bubble
model was first developed to predict plume dynamics and
gas transfer for a circular bubble-plume diffuser. The
discrete-bubble approach has subsequently been validated
using oxygen transfer tests in a large vertical tank and
applied successfully at full-scale to an airlift aerator as well
as to both circular and linear bubble-plume diffusers.
The performance of each of the four completely different full-
scale systems (on a scale of 10 m or more) was predicted
based on the behavior of individual bubbles (on a scale
of about 1 mm). The combined results suggest that the models
can be used with some confidence to predict system
performance based on applied air or oxygen flow rate,
initial bubble size, and, in the case of bubble plume diffusers,
near-field boundary conditions. The discrete-bubble
approach has also been extended to the Speece Cone,
but the model has not yet been validated due to a lack of
suitable data. The unified suite of models, all based on
simplediscrete-bubbledynamics,representsthecurrentstate-
of-the-art for designing systems to add oxygen to stratified
lakes and reservoirs.
Introduction
Low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnia of
lakes or reservoirs can negatively affect releases downstream
of hydropower reservoirs, the drinking-water treatment
process, and cold-water fisheries (1). In the U.S., discharges
from hydropower reservoirs typically must comply with state
water quality criteria for minimum dissolved oxygen (DO)
concentrations (2). Oxygen depletion in lakes and reservoirs
can lead to increases in hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and
phosphorus and can also cause reduced iron and manganese
inthesedimentstosolubilize.Ifentrainedintotheproductive
surface zone, phosphorus may stimulate algal growth and
ultimately fuel additional oxygen demand. Hydrogen sulfide
and reduced iron and manganese cause problems associated
with taste, odor, and color if hypolimnetic water is treated
for potable use (3). The presence of reduced compounds
also results in increased oxidant demand at the water
treatment plant, leading to increased drinking water treat-
ment costs. The increased use of oxidants such as chlorine
may also contribute to the formation of disinfection byprod-
ucts. Winter fishkills in ice-covered lakes with anoxic
hypolimnia are also a serious concern (4). Finally, hypoxia
has been shown to be an endocrine disrupter in fish, which
impairs fish reproduction (5).
Hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation are commonly
usedtoadddissolvedoxygentowaterbodieswhilepreserving
stratification (Supporting Information, Table 1). Numerous
studies have been conducted documenting the physical,
chemical, and biological effects of hypolimnetic aeration and
oxygenation in lakes and reservoirs. These studies have been
reviewed by Fast and Lorenzen (6), Taggart and McQueen
(7), Pastorok et al. (8, 9), McQueen and Lean (10), and Beutel
and Horne (11). Despite the large number of hypolimnetic
aeration and oxygenation investigations, relatively few have
examined the parameters that impact system performance,
and there is no comprehensive review of published hy-
polimnetic aeration and oxygenation design methods. In this
paper, the various types of aeration and oxygenation devices
are briefly discussed, select installations are summarized,
and a suite of published design methods that has been
validatedusingdatacollectedfromfull-scalefieldinstallations
is reviewed in detail. A unifying feature of these recently
published works is the use of a simple discrete-bubble model
to predict oxygen transfer in the various hypolimnetic
aeration and oxygenation systems. The performance of each
of the four completely different full-scale systems (on a scale
of 10 m or more) is predicted based on the behavior of
individual bubbles (on a scale of about 1 mm).
Hypolimnetic Aeration and Oxygenation Devices
Mercier and Perret (12) developed one of the earliest aeration
systems, which utilized mechanical agitation of water
pumped from the hypolimnion into a splash basin on the
surface of a lake. Another type of aeration method is layer
aeration, which redistributes available dissolved oxygen
obtained from algal photosynthesis and contact with the
atmosphere (13, 14). Airlift devices have also been used for
hypolimnetic aeration. Partial-lift systems operate by inject-
ing compressed air near the bottom of the hypolimnion. The
air-water mixture travels up a vertical tube to a given depth
in the lake from which the remaining gas bubbles are vented
to the atmosphere through a pipe to the surface. The
oxygenated water is returned to the hypolimnion. Full-lift
systems are similar except the air-water mixture rises to the
surface before residual gas bubbles are released. Regarding
hypolimnetic oxygenation, one technique involves with-
drawing water to the shore, injecting it with pure oxygen gas
underhighpressure,andthenreturningittothehypolimnion.
This is known as side-stream pumping or side-stream
supersaturation and is one of the earliest reported oxygen-

ation systems (11, 15). Another side-stream method entails
mixing air or pure oxygen into withdrawn water, pumping
or passing the bubble-water mixture down a deep U-tube to
enhance gas transfer, and returning oxygenated water that
is discharged at the top of the tube (16, 17). In submerged
contact systems, oxygen is injected into an enclosed chamber
usually located in the hypolimnion, and water is either
pumped or entrained into the device (11). Oxygen transfer
occurs within the chamber, and oxygenated water is dis-
charged to the hypolimnion. A Speece Cone employs this
principle (18). Finally, either compressed air or pure oxygen
gas can be introduced into the hypolimnion throughdiffusers
to form a rising, unconfined bubble-plume. While the devices
described represent the majority of hypolimnetic aeration
and oxygenation systems, this selection is not all-inclusive.
The primary types of hypolimnetic aeration and oxygen-
ation systems currently in use include airlift aerators, Speece
Cones, and bubble-plume diffusers (19). Most documented
installations use one of these three primary devices (Sup-
porting Information, Table 1). Also, most reported models
and studies regarding system design are related to these
apparatuses. These specific hypolimnetic aeration and
oxygenation devices are thus the focus of this review.
Airlift Aerator. Full-lift hypolimnetic aerators typically
consist of (1) a vertical riser tube, (2) a diffuser inside the
bottomof the riser tube, (3) an air-water separation chamber
at the top of the riser, and (4) one or two return pipes, called
downcomers (Figure 1) (10). Compressed air is delivered to
the aerator and bubbles freely from the diffuser. This creates
apositivelybuoyantgas-watermixturethatascendstheriser.
At the topof the riser, bubbles are released to the atmosphere,
and some may be entrained in the water that enters the
downcomers. The oxygenated water descends the down-
comers and is returned to the hypolimnion (20).
Speece Cone. The Speece Cone, developed by Dr. Richard
Speece, was originally known as a submerged downflow
bubble contactor (18, 21). The system consists of a source
of oxygen gas, a conical bubble contact chamber, a sub-
mersible pump, and a diffuser that disperses highly oxygen-
ated water into the hypolimnion (Figure 2). Ambient water
and oxygen gas bubbles are introduced at the top of the
cone. As water flows down the cone, the velocity decreases
because the cross-sectional area of the cone increases. The
system is designed so that the downward velocity of the water
atthetopoftheconeissufficienttoovercometherisevelocity
of the bubbles initially introduced. At the bottom of the cone,
the water velocity is designed to be less than the bubble rise
velocity of the now smaller bubbles. The applied water flow
rate and slope of the walls control the water velocity and,
therefore, the time available for gas transfer (22).
Bubble-Plume Diffuser. Bubble-plume diffusers are
generally linear or circular (Figure 3) and inject either air or

oxygen at a relatively low gas flow rate (19). Circular plumes
are also referred to as round plumes, and linear bubble
plumes are often identified as line bubble plumes or bubble
curtains in the literature. These systems are most suitable
for deep lakes where the bulk of the bubbles dissolves in the
hypolimnion and the momentum generated by the plume
is low enough to prevent significant erosion of the ther-
mocline (23). Gas bubbles are injected into the water column
through a porous diffuser creating a gas/water mixture that
rises and gains momentum due to a positive buoyancy flux.
The buoyant mixture entrains water at the boundaries, which
increases the water flow rate and cross-sectional area but
decreases the momentum. The plume rises against the
vertical density gradient until the depth of maximum plume
rise(DMPR)isreached,whichiswheretheplumemomentum
is zero. The plume water at this depth is negatively buoyant
and is expected to fall back to an equilibrium depth (ED)
where the plume density equals the ambient density (24).
Upon reaching the ED, the plume water intrudes horizontally
into the far-field (24).
Discrete Bubble Model
A significant unifying advance in hypolimnetic aeration and
oxygenation system design is the use of the discrete-bubble
model for predicting oxygen transfer. In each of the three
primary devices, interfacial gas transfer is accomplished
through individual bubbles in contact with water. Bubble
size is an important parameter because it is directly related
to the interfacial surface area, bubble-rise velocity (25, 26),
and the mass-transfer coefficient (25, 27). In addition, bubble
size may vary significantly as the bubbles pass through the
system or ascend the water column. For these reasons, Wu¨est
et al. (23) developed a discrete-bubble model for a circular
bubble-plume that accounts for volumetric changes due to
gas transfer as well as changing hydrostatic pressure and
water temperature. The method has subsequently been
applied to diffused-bubble aeration in a large vertical tank
(19), an airlift aerator (20, 28), a Speece Cone (22), and a
linear bubble-plume diffuser (1, 29).
The discrete-bubble approach previously employed by
Wu¨est et al. (23) was verified by McGinnis and Little (19) for
individual bubbles rising in plug flow through a well-mixed
volumeofwater.Themolarflowrateorfluxofgaseousspecies
transferred per unit height under steady-state conditions is
where FGi is the gas flux, z is the vertical coordinate, KL is the
mass transfer coefficient, Hi is Henry’s constant, Pi is gas
partial pressure at a given depth, Ci is the bulk aqueous
concentration, r is the bubble radius, v is the water velocity,
and vb is the bubble rise velocity. N is the number flux of
bubbles introduced by the diffuser per unit time and is
equivalent to Qgas/Vo, where Qgas is the actual volumetric gas
flow rate through the diffuser and Vo is the initial volume of
a bubble formed at the diffuser. Gas-phase mass-transfer
resistance may be neglected for transfer of oxygen and
nitrogen, and Henry’s constants are provided by Wu¨est et al.
(23) as a function of temperature (Supporting Information,
Table 2). Because the bulk aqueous concentration changes
veryslowly,pseudo-steady-stateconditionsmaybeassumed.
Consequently, eq 1 can be integrated to obtain the change
in the molar flow rate of undissolved gas during the bubble
contact period. The results can then be used to predict the
evolving aqueous concentration in the well-mixed volume
of water with respect to time.
In eq 1, the bubble radius r is a function of hydrostatic
pressure and the mass of oxygen and nitrogen within the
bubble at a given depth. These parameters change as the
bubble rises, resulting in a change in the partial pressure of
oxygen and nitrogen within the bubble. Wu¨est et al. (23)
developedcorrelationsfor KLandvb(SupportingInformation,
Table 2) based on published experimental data for bubble-
rise velocity (26) and the mass-transfer coefficient (27). These
correlations are functions of bubble radius, so the mass
transfer coefficient and rise velocity may be adjusted as the
bubble changes in size. In addition to the correlations by
Wu¨estetal.(23),otherequationsforH,KL,andvbareavailable
in the literature. Clift et al. (25) and Leifer and Patro (30)
presented detailed parametrizations for KL and vb, and Weiss
(31) developed relationships for H or solubility as a function
of temperature and salinity. Also, Vasconcelos et al. (32) and
Alvesetal.(33)reportedthatbubblecontaminationcanaffect
mass transfer and bubble rise velocity.
The initial dissolved oxygen concentration, water tem-
perature, and depth at the diffuser are known. The initial
dissolved nitrogen concentration is assumed to be at
equilibrium with the atmosphere. If the initial bubble
diameter formed by the diffuser is also known, then the initial
gaseous molar flow rate of oxygen or nitrogen (Moi) can be
calculated by
where Yoi is initial mole fraction of the gas, Pstd is standard
pressure, Qstd is gas flow rate at standard conditions (0 °C
and 1 bar), R is the ideal gas constant, and Tstd is standard
temperature. For deep diffusers subject to relatively high

pressures, the van der Waals equation of state can be used
to more accurately calculate the initial gas flow rates (23).
In the differential gas flux equation of the discrete-bubble
model (eq 1), the quantity v + vb represents the net bubble
velocityduetothewatervelocityvandthebubblerisevelocity
vb. The rise velocity is a function of bubble radius (23, 25, 30)
and varies as the bubbles rise because of decompression
and gas transfer. For the Speece Cone, v can be easily
calculated because water flow rate and the cone dimensions
are typically known. In the case of the airlift aerator, water
flow rate is constant through the device but is not generally
known and must be calculated using the gas flow rate, gas
holdup, and aerator dimensions. For the bubble plume, v
varies along the plume rise height due to entrainment and
must be modeled by separate dynamic equations of motion.
Thus, the discrete-bubble model is generally solved as a
coupled system of equations for hydrodynamics and gas
transfer when applied to bubble plumes.
The discrete-bubble model was validated by McGinnis
and Little (19) using oxygen transfer data collected in a large
verticaltankandthemeasuredinitialbubble-sizedistribution
and applied air flow rate. In addition to the previously listed
assumptions, bubble size distribution and the rate of bubble
formation were assumed constant, bubble coalescence and
mass transfer of gases other than nitrogen and oxygen were
neglected,andmasstransferatthewatersurfacewasassumed
to be small. Also, it was assumed that the water velocity
induced by the rising bubbles v (eq 1) was negligible.
Therefore, the net bubble velocity was equal to the bubble
rise velocity.
The oxygen transfer tests were conducted in a 14-m high
by 2-m diameter tank equipped with a porous hose diffuser
supplied with air flow rates of 0.43, 0.68, and 2.88 Nm3/h
(standard or normal conditions of 1 bar and 0 °C). Another
set of experiments was conducted at four air flow rates and
two water depths to determine the effects of gas flow rate
and hydrostatic pressure on initial bubble size. The released
bubbles formed a weak plume within the tank during testing,
but the induced vertical velocity could not be measured.
Bubble size distributions were measured from digitized
photos of the bubble swarms in the tank immediately above
the diffuser. McGinnis and Little found that the differences
between bubble sizes formed at the two different depths
were negligible. To simplify model application, a representa-
tive Sauter-mean diameter (diameter of a sphere having the
same volume-to-surface area ratio as the distribution of
bubbles) (34, 35) was calculated. A correlation equation was
developed to relate bubble size to actual volumetric gas flow
rate at the diffuser. The range of bubble diameters included
the region of greatest variation in rise velocity and mass-
transfercoefficient.Thecalculatedbubblesizesandmeasured
air flow rates were used in the discrete-bubble model to
predict the DO profiles over time (Figure 4). The observed
and predicted DO curves are comparable, with root-mean-
square errors of 0.65, 0.60, and 1.31 for the 0.43, 0.68, and
2.88 Nm3/h tests, respectively. Although the model is biased
toward higher than observed DO concentrations, all of the
test data were predicted to within 15%.
McGinnis and Little (19) investigated several assumptions
of the discrete-bubble model. The responses of the three
oxygen probes at different depths within the tank for each
test were essentially equivalent, confirming that the water
was well-mixed. To check the validity of using the Sauter-
meandiameterasopposedtothefullbubblesizedistribution,
the model was modified to include a range of bubble sizes,
and similar oxygen transfer rates were obtained. The cor-
relation equation for bubble-rise velocity was also examined,
but using theoretically derived rise velocities made virtually
no difference to the model results. The model was modified
to include an induced vertical water velocity of 0.04 m s-1,
but the modification did not change the predicted oxygen
concentrations appreciably.
Design Studies and Application of the Discrete Bubble
Model
Inthissection,hypolimneticaerationandoxygenationdesign
studies are reviewed for each of the primary devices. For
each type of aerator or oxygenator, a brief overview of early
models and design studies is provided, and the major
contributions and shortcomings of these models are em-
phasized. Then, models that utilize the discrete-bubble
approach and related validation studies are reviewed in
greater detail.
AirliftAerator.Ofthethreeprimarydevices,airliftaerators
were installed most frequently during the early years of
hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation (Supporting Infor-
mation, Table 1). Consequently, a number of researchers
have conducted design studies of airlift aerators, including
Lorenzen and Fast (36), Taggart and McQueen (37), Ashley
(38), and Little (39). Because these early design methods and
models do not employ the discrete bubble approach, details
havebeenincludedintheSupportingInformation.Ingeneral,
theearlystudiesofairliftaeratorsprovidedusefulinformation
on aerator design and operation but are primarily empirically
based and make a number of key assumptions that have not
been confirmed (Supporting Information).
Burris and Little (28) developed a fundamental approach
to predict oxygen transfer in airlift aerators, patterned after
the discrete-bubble approach of Wu¨est et al. (23). The first
fundamental model for predicting water flow rate in airlift
aerators, which is based on an energy balance, was developed
by Little and Del Vecchio (40). Burris et al. (20) extended and
validated these oxygen transfer and water flow rate models
using experimental data collected from a full-scale aerator
in Lake Prince, VA. Dissolved oxygen profiles, water flow
rates, and gas holdups were measured over a wide range of
applied air flow rates (65 Nm3/h-227 Nm3/h).
The oxygen transfer model focuses on individual bubbles
and accounts for changes in bubble size due to decreasing
hydrostatic pressure as well as mass transfer of oxygen and
nitrogen. Assuming steady-state, and based on the discrete-
bubble model (Supporting Information, Table 2), a set of
four equations was obtained by applying a differential mass
balance on each phase (dissolved and gaseous) and each
molecular species of interest (oxygen and nitrogen) (Sup-
porting Information, Tables 3 and 4).
The primary equations for the water flow rate model for
the full-lift aerator come from literature on airlift bioreactors.
The model is based on a steady-state macroscopic energy
balance over the entire aerator (Supporting Information,
FIGURE 4. Observed and predicted DO concentrations validating
discrete-bubble model during oxygen transfer experiments in a
large vertical tank (19).
VOL. 40, NO. 24, 2006 / ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY 9 7515

Table 4). The rate of energy input due to gas flow is equal
to the rate of energy dissipation due to fluid flow (41). The
energy balance includes terms for energy input due to
isothermal gas expansion (35), energy dissipation due to
bubble wakes in the riser (41), energy loss due to riser and
downcomer wall friction (35, 42), energy loss due to local
flow disturbances, and energy loss due to fluid turnaround
at the top of the riser (35) (Supporting Information, Table 4).
By varying a single parameter (the initial bubble size), the
oxygen transfer model was applied to predict DO concentra-
tions (Figure 5) and gas holdups in the riser over the range
of air flow rates tested. The model provided a close fit to the
experimentalDOprofiles,andnearlyallthegasholdupvalues
were predicted within 20% of the observed. The calculated
bubble sizes agreed well with the Sauter-mean diameters
measured during replicated laboratory experiments. To test
the validity of assuming a uniform initial bubble size, an
analysis was performed using the bubble size distribution.
The predicted oxygen concentrations did not differ signifi-
cantly from those obtained using the Sauter-mean bubble
diameter, similar to the results obtained by McGinnis and
Little (19) when applying the discrete-bubble model to
experiments conducted in a large, well-mixed tank. The
model was extended to account for oxygen transfer in the
air-water separator and to predict, a priori, the DO profiles
in the downcomers (Figure 5). Oxygen transfer in the
separator and downcomers is due to contact with the
atmosphereandbubblecarryoverfromtheriser,respectively.
As shown in Figure 5, the model output compares very well
with the experimental data.
In the Burris et al. (20) study, the only unknown with
respecttothewaterflowratemodelwasKt,thelosscoefficient
for the top section of the aerator. An empirical relationship
was obtained for Kt as a function of superficial water velocity,
with a root-mean-square value of 0.92. Excluding data at the
lowest air flow rate, the range of calculated values for Kt
(3-8) is close to a literature value of 5.5 proposed for
hydrodynamically similar external airlift bioreactors. Ad-
ditionally, the authors reported that frictional loss terms for
the top section and local flow disturbances are relatively
important in the overall energy balance, suggesting that
attention should be given to these features during aerator
design.
Speece Cone. The downflow bubble contactor, or Speece
Cone, was originally proposed by Speece (43) in 1969. Two
years later, Speece et al. (21) described the device in greater
detail and conducted bench- and pilot-scale experiments to
measure oxygen transfer performance. Even though the
concept of using a submerged contact chamber for downflow
bubble aeration/oxygenation has been available for over 30
years,onlyafewSpeeceConeinstallationshavebeenreported
in the literature (Supporting Information, Table 1). The only
published model that predicts oxygen transfer in a Speece
Cone was developed by McGinnis and Little (22). However,
an earlier gas transfer model for U-tube aeration was
developed by Speece and Orosco (44) in 1970, and U-tubes
have some features that are similar to Speece Cones.
The Speece Cone model of McGinnis and Little (22) is
based on the discrete-bubble approach, and oxygen transfer
efficiency is calculated as a function of initial bubble size,
gas and water flow rates, depth of operation, and cone
dimensions. It is assumed that the bubbles are spherical and
of uniform initial size, no bubble coalescence or breakup
occurs, water and gas are in plug flow, and the system is at
steady-state. Mass balances for dissolved and gaseous oxygen
and nitrogen result in a system of equations that incorporate
gas transfer between phases, change in gas partial pressure
and water velocity with depth, influence of gas holdup, and
changing radius of the cone (Supporting Information, Tables
3 and 5), again based on the discrete-bubble approach
(Supporting Information, Table 2).
Experimental data for a Speece Cone were not available
for model validation, so McGinnis and Little (22) performed
a preliminary analysis using assumed cone dimensions and
operational parameters. A high oxygen transfer capacity was
predicted, due to the relatively long bubble contact time
calculated for the baseline conditions. The performance of
the Speece Cone was also estimated as a function of depth
(Supporting Information, Table 6) by adjusting the standard
gas flow rate to provide an equivalent volumetric gas flow
rate (20 L s-1) at the cone inlet for each depth. This resulted
in increasing gas mass flow rates as the cone depth was
increased. The predicted oxygen transfer efficiencies were
all between 92 and 93%. Model results revealed sensitivity
to initial bubble size. If too large a bubble is produced, the
bubbles do not dissolve rapidly enough, and cone perfor-
mance may be impaired. For the baseline conditions, the
most rapid increase in DO was predicted to occur mid-depth
in the cone, where the bubble velocity relative to the cone
was lowest.
Bubble-Plume Diffuser. Because bubble-plumes are
encountered in a variety of natural and man-made systems,
numerous studies have been conducted on plume dynamics
(45-59). Less work has been performed on bubble-plumes
in stratified environments (53, 58, 60-62), and even fewer
investigations have been performed on bubble-plumes
incorporating gas transfer (45, 63-66). Bubble-plumes
intended for hypolimnetic aeration or oxygenation must be
capable of increasing dissolved oxygen concentrations, and
lakes and reservoirs commonly have vertical density and
concentration gradients. Therefore, only hypolimnetic aera-
tion and oxygenation design methods that account for gas
transfer and stratification are reviewed here. Also, because

this work focuses on aeration and oxygenation methods that
preserve stratification, destratification models (58, 60, 65,
67) were not reviewed. One of the earliest models to predict
oxygen transfer and hydrodynamics of bubble-plumes in
stratified hypolimnia was introduced by Rayyan and Speece
(68) and is similar to the discrete-bubble approach. However,
there are several significant differences from the bubble-
plume model of Wu¨est et al. (23), so details of the Rayyan
and Speece (68) work have been provided in the Supporting
Information.
Plume hydrodynamics are strongly influenced by initial
bubble size and gas flow rate. A model that uses the discrete-
bubble approach to predict hydrodynamics and constituent
concentrations in circular bubble-plumes was developed by
Wu¨est et al. (23). The plume model theory is based on
horizontallyintegratedequationsoftheconservationofmass,
momentum, heat, salinity, and gas species (53). Entrainment
is also considered, and the entrainment velocity is assumed
proportional to the local plume velocity and plume circum-
ference (53). The plume model includes the effects of density
stratification due to vertical temperature and salinity gra-
dients. A key contribution of the Wu¨est et al. (23) model was
the use of a variable buoyancy flux to account for changing
bubble size due to not only decompression and thermal
expansion but also gas dissolution and stripping. Although
previous studies neglected gas exchange, it is particularly
important in deep systems or for weak plumes where gas
transfer can be significant.
Table 7 (Supporting Information) lists the key variables
of the plume model. Based on eight flux equations (Sup-
porting Information, Table 8) that are solved simultaneously,
the model predicts water flow rate, water entrainment, gas
transfer, plume temperature, constituent concentrations
(oxygen, nitrogen, and salinity), DMPR, and ED for the given
boundary conditions of diffuser depth and diameter, applied
gas flow rate, initial bubble size, and boundary profiles
(temperature, DO, and salinity). The initial plume water
velocity (vo) is determined based on an initial densimetric
Froude number (Fro) of 1.6 or
where λ is the spreading ratio of bubbles to fluid flow, b is
plume radius for velocity and dissolved species, g is gravi-
tational acceleration, Fa is ambient water density, and Fp is
plume bubble-water mixture density. The equations of the
circular bubble plume model are valid above the zone of
flow establishment. Therefore, the Froude number is used
to calculate an initial plume water velocity to solve the
equations, even though the actual water velocity is zero.
McGinnis et al. (24) conducted a detailed analysis of the
plume-lake interaction in Lake Hallwil, Switzerland by
collecting high spatial-resolution temperature, salinity, and
DO profiles and used the results for a full-scale evaluation
of the Wu¨est et al. (23) circular bubble-plume model. During
testing, the circular diffuser was supplied with compressed
airat30Nm3/h.Incontrasttomodelassumptions,thebubble
core was not observed to spread at the same rate as the
plume. This will result in a higher localized buoyancy flux,
which will cause higher inner core water velocities and a
greater local rise height. Additionally, multiple detrainment,
plume wandering, and cross-flow due to seiching was
observed, which may have altered the plume entrainment
coefficient and the boundary conditions. The entrainment
coefficient is considered to be constant in the circular plume
model, but McGinnis et al. (24) suggested that entrainment
likely varies along the plume rise height because of differing
levels of turbulence at the plume boundaries as the plume
water velocity changes, variations in the ambient density
gradient, and mixing where the plume stops rising. Entrain-
ment occurred from the near-field, which was where
detrained water accumulated over tens of meters from the
plume, as opposed to the far-field as previously thought. In
Lake Hallwil, the seiche-enhanced near-field region was
mixed much more than the ambient, or far-field, environ-
ment. This resulted in a greater plume rise height because
there was a lower density gradient to overcome. Because
entrainment was mostly from the near-field, plume tem-
perature and constituent concentrations depended strongly
on that region, which was created by the plume itself.
Therefore, plume properties and model predictions were
strongly dependent on the evolving near-field boundary
conditions.Currently,near-fieldboundaryconditionscannot
be predicted for bubble plume design and must either be
measuredorassumed.Predictionoftheplume-affectednear-
field is discussed further in the Future Research section.
Using the near-field boundary profiles, the circular plume
model predicted both the plume width and depth of
maximum plume rise very well (Figure 6). Figure 1 in the
Supporting Information shows the averaged measured in-
plume temperature and DO profiles and the model predic-
tions. The predicted temperature profile compares well but
diverges toward the top of the plume to approximately 0.3
°C less than the measured temperature. This may be a result
of somewhat inaccurate boundary profiles. The plume may
have entrained and detrained water at different rates and
with different properties depending on the direction and
magnitude of the horizontal seiche current and the interac-
tion with varying ambient density gradients along the plume
rise height. Also, the average plume temperature and DO are

based on a two-dimensional transect and may have been
laterallyheterogeneous.Theplumeboundarieswerenotwell-
defined due to inhomogeneity caused by seiching and
detrainment. The variation in DO around the plume was
also substantial (Figure 6 and Supporting Information, Figure
1), and selection of improper DO boundary conditions may
have resulted in the slight underprediction of the DO profile
(24).
Using data collected from a full-scale linear diffuser
installed in Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR), VA, U.S.A.,
Singleton et al. (29) validated the performance of the linear
bubble-plume model developed earlier by McGinnis et al.
(69). The model equations were derived using the discrete-
bubble approach of Wu¨est et al. (23). The linear bubble-
plume model is nearly identical to the circular plume model
except for the geometry of the plume (Supporting Informa-
tion, Tables 7 and 9). Singleton et al. (29) refined the linear
plume model by more accurately characterizing the plume
geometry at the ends of the linear diffuser, by using a
correlationequationtocalculateinitialbubblesize,correcting
λ and the entrainment coefficient R for top-hat profiles, and
by deriving relationships to determine vo as a function of Fro.
The values of R and λ used were 0.11 and 0.93, respectively,
as reported by Fanneløp et al. (56) for linear bubble plumes
and adjusted for top-hat profiles (54). Similar to the circular
bubble-plume model, vo was determined based on Fro equal
to 2.0 or
where W is the linear plume width for velocity and dissolved
species.
To fully evaluate the linear bubble-plume model, high
spatial-resolutiontemperature,salinity,andDOprofileswere
collected during diffuser operation in SHR using compressed
air at 38 Nm3/h during July 2003 and pure oxygen at 13 and
40 Nm3/h during August 2003 and October 2004, respectively.
Measured contour plots of temperature and DO were
compared to model predictions for plume width and the
depth of maximum plume rise. For July 2003 and October
2004 (Supporting Information, Figure 2), the DMPR is
simulated well by the model. However, the plume rise height
was underestimated for August 2003, when the gas flow rate
was comparatively low. The underprediction may have been
due to an overestimated value forR. The linear bubble-plume
modelassumesthatRisconstant,butMilgram(55)concluded
that R for round or circular bubble plumes is directly
proportional to the plume gas fraction. Predicted vertical
profiles of temperature and DO within the plumes were also
compared to average measured values for the three diffuser
test conditions (Figure 7). The temperature predictions for
July 2003 and October 2004 deviated from the measured pro-
files where the plumes reach the top of the hypolimnion or
where the rate of plume spreading was greatest (Supporting
Information, Figure 2). The model underpredicted the final
plume temperature by approximately 0.3 and 0.2 °C for July
2003 and October 2004, respectively. Proposed reasons for
the temperature differences include variable entrainment as
the plume width increases and inaccuracy in selected
boundaryconditions.Theentrainmentcoefficientforcircular
bubble plumes has been found to also increase with values
of a characteristic length that is a function of the 4/5 power
of the plume radius (55). The model simulated the plume
DO profiles well for all three diffuser tests (Figure 7) and
characterized the initial increase in DO immediately above
the diffuser quite accurately for July and August 2003.
Future Research
When properly designed, hypolimnetic aeration and oxy-
genation systems can replenish dissolved oxygen in water
bodies while preserving stratification. The discrete-bubble
model, first employed by Wu¨est et al. (23) to predict gas
transfer in a circular bubble-plume, has been independently
validated by McGinnis and Little (19) using data collected
during oxygen transfer tests in a large vertical tank. The
discrete-bubble approach has subsequently been applied to
an airlift aerator (20), a Speece Cone (22), a circular bubble-
plume diffuser (21, 22), and a linear bubble-plume diffuser
(1, 29, 69, 70). With the exception of the Speece Cone, for
which few data exist, all the models employing the discrete-
bubbleapproachhavebeensuccessfullyvalidatedatfullscale.
The discrete bubble-model, which describes gas transfer
based on bubble properties on a millimeter scale, has been
successfully applied to predict oxygen transfer for devices
with dimensions that are typically on the scale of ten meters
or more. These combined results suggest that the suite of
models can be used with some confidence when designing
systems to add oxygen to stratified lakes and reservoirs. The
models of Burris et al. (20), McGinnis and Little (22), Wu¨est
et al. (23), and Singleton et al. (29) therefore represent the
currentstate-of-the-artforpredictingoxygentransferinairlift
aerators, Speece Cones, circular bubble-plume diffusers, and
linear bubble-plume diffusers, respectively, based on the
applied air or oxygen flow rate and the initial bubble-size
formed at the diffuser. Despite these encouraging results,
there are several aspects that need further investigation.
Because a frictional loss coefficient was empirically fit to
experimental data, the general applicability of the energy-
balance model for airlift aerators should be further verified.
The airlift model should also be extended to other full- and
partial-lift aerator designs. The Speece Cone model should
be verified against field data for a range of applied gas flow
rates. Also, a method should be developed to predict the
effect of plume operation on near-field boundary conditions,
short circuiting of plume detrainment, and plume fallback
beyond the equilibrium depth (24).
Operation of hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation
devices usually alters the DO concentration profiles and

thermal structure of a waterbody. Oxygen transfer efficiency
is a function of the surrounding water column properties,
establishing a feedback loop that continually changes system
performance. This effect is most pronounced during opera-
tion of bubble-plume diffusers because plume performance
depends strongly on the vertical density gradient. The
interaction of the aerator/oxygenator with the water column
should be accounted for in the design and operation of
bubble-plume diffusers as well as the other aeration and
oxygenation devices. To this end, McGinnis et al. (69)
performedapreliminary couplingofthelinear bubble-plume
model with a reservoir model, CE-QUAL-W2 (W2). The
coupled model was tested using data collected from Spring
Hollow Reservoir, VA. W2 is a two-dimensional, laterally
averaged, hydrodynamic and water quality model developed
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (71). The coupled model
predicted mixing and warming induced by plume operation
quite accurately (Supporting Information, Figure 3). In
addition, the evolution of hypolimnetic DO was predicted
well (Supporting Information, Figure 3), although the model
incorporates a zero- or first-order estimate of sediment
oxygen demand (with respect to particulate organic matter)
that has not been conclusively verified. As currently repre-
sented, the coupled model underpredicts the rate of oxygen
addition because additional oxygen transfer after plume
detrainment is not calculated. Based on the promising
McGinnis et al. (69) results, the coupled model is being
developed to predict plume dynamics and plume-induced
mixing. A natural extension of this work is to incorporate the
other hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation devices, such
as the airlift aerator and Speece Cone.
Another alternative to predicting the effect of plume
operation on the near-field was presented by Asaeda and
Imberger (58). These researchers developed a partial double-
plume model, in which the upward momentum is contained
within an inner plume and the detraining water forms an
outer annular plume that flows downward. The annular
downdraught is assumed to descend to the neutral buoyancy
depth and flow out horizontally as an intrusion. Above the
intrusion depth, the ascending inner plume entrains water
fromthedescendingouter plume.Although theplume model
of Asaeda and Imberger (58) is intended for destratification
systems and therefore does not consider gas transfer, the
model provides valuable insight into the hydrodynamics of
plume interaction with the near-field.

Early Design Studies 
Airlift Aerator.  One of the first attempts to design 
airlift aerators was developed by Lorenzen and Fast 
(1).  The primary objective was to size a compressor 
by determining the design air flow rate.  The air flow 
rate is calculated using the hypolimnetic oxygen 
depletion rate and the induced water flow rate 
through the aerator.  Based on general observations 
of full-lift aerators, the authors assumed that water 
reaching the top of the device is saturated with 
oxygen.  The air flow rate required to induce this 
water flow rate is a function of the aerator 
dimensions.  The available theoretical head results 
from the difference in density between the air-water 
mixture in the riser and the ambient lake water.  It 
was also assumed that half of the theoretical head is 
used to convey water to the surface and that the 
remainder is dissipated in the downcomer.  Lorenzen 
and Fast (1) provided practical guidance and 
information regarding the major variables that affect 
the performance of airlift aerators.  However, the 
aerator sizing method presented makes a number of 
critical assumptions that are unverified.   
The design method of Taggart and McQueen 
(2) involves determining the dimensions of the riser 
and downcomer when compressor capacity is known.  
The authors presented an empirically-based approach 
for 
establishing 
full-lift 
aerator 
specifications 
including diffuser depth, air flow rate, water flow 
rate, and riser and downcomer cross-sectional areas.  
Water flow rate is calculated using a correlation that 
was developed from a regression of data collected 
from 20 published experiments.  To determine the 
optimum riser cross-sectional area, the authors 
assumed that the maximum induced water velocity is 
a function of the median estimated bubble rise 
velocity.  The method of Taggart and McQueen (2) 
represents a simple, straightforward approach for the 
hydrodynamic design of airlift aerators.  While the 
model did provide additional insight into aerator 
sizing, it lacks key elements.  Oxygen transfer cannot 
be predicted by the model and the authors did not 
consider the effect of gas flux on induced water 
velocity.  However, Taggart and McQueen (2) did 
account for gas flow when developing a correlation 
to calculate induced water flow rate as a function of 
volumetric air flow rate and riser depth.   
Another empirical airlift aerator model was 
proposed by Ashley (3).  In addition to aerator sizing, 
Ashley also discussed other practical design features 
including air supply, rated and actual air flow, and 
performance specifications.  The model was derived 
from the work of Lorenzen and Fast (1) and Taggart 
and McQueen (2) as well as experience with a full-
scale system.  The model assumes that the induced 
water flow rate will completely satisfy the oxygen 
consumption in the hypolimnion measured during 
spring stratification.  The model also requires an 
estimate of the increase in the dissolved oxygen (DO) 
concentration 
produced 
by 
the 
aerator.  
Determination of the DO increase is an important 
variable, and Ashley (3) suggested that this parameter 
may be difficult to predict.  Ashley (3) presented a 
detailed, step-wise method for sizing an airlift aerator 
and 
provided 
useful 
information 
related 
to 
engineering aspects such as compressors, power 
supply, oxygen transfer efficiency, and oxygenation 
capacity.  The model of Ashley (3) was field tested 
by 
Ashley 
and 
co-workers 
(4) 
(Supporting 
Information, Table 1), but the aeration system was 
unable to satisfy the hypolimnetic oxygen demand 
because the induced water velocity and oxygen input 
were overestimated during design.

Little (5) developed a model to predict oxygen 
transfer in a full-lift hypolimnetic aerator by applying 
mass balance equations.  Input parameters include 
aerator dimensions, volumetric air flow rate, diffuser 
depth, and ambient water conditions.  To calculate 
water flow rate, an empirical correlation that is a 
function of superficial gas velocity (volumetric gas 
flow rate/entire riser cross-sectional area) and riser 
length was developed.  The correlation was derived 
from the same data set used by Taggart and McQueen 
(2), except dependence on riser diameter was 
eliminated. 
 
Literature 
correlations, 
originally 
developed for bubble columns and airlift reactors, 
were used to estimate the mass transfer coefficient 
and gas holdup (volume fraction of gas in the bubble-
water mixture) in the riser.  The model assumes that 
gas holdup is small, water is in plug flow, and 
nitrogen transfer is negligible.  The model proposed 
by Little (5) was the first attempt to develop a 
fundamental approach for predicting oxygen transfer 
in full-lift aerators, but the model relies on empirical 
correlations to calculate important variables.  Also, 
nitrogen transfer can be significant for relatively deep 
systems and will subsequently affect bubble volume 
and bubble-size dependent properties including the 
rise velocity and mass transfer coefficient (6-8). 
Bubble-Plume Diffuser.  Rayyan and Speece 
(9) developed one of the earliest models to predict 
oxygen transfer and hydrodynamics of bubble-
plumes in stratified environments.  The model 
derivation extended the round or circular bubble-
plume equations of Cederwall and Ditmars (10) to 
incorporate gas transfer and non-linear stratification.  
The model calculates maximum plume rise height, 
centerline velocity and nominal half-width, and 
density and temperature differences between the 
plume and the ambient water column.  Conservation 
principles were applied to a circular plume to derive 
relationships 
for 
water, 
oxygen, 
momentum, 
buoyancy, and heat fluxes.  Entrainment of ambient 
water is proportional to the plume centerline velocity 
(11), and the entrainment coefficient was set equal to 
0.04 for low flow rates in the laboratory and 0.055 
for higher flow rates in the field.  The water and 
bubble spreading coefficients were 1.25 and 0.2, 
respectively.  Bubble size varies along the plume 
height and is a function of oxygen transfer and local 
hydrostatic pressure.  The model of Rayyan and 
Speece (9) represents a significant advance in bubble-
plume modeling because both oxygen transfer and 
stratification are considered.  Although the model 
employs elements of the discrete-bubble approach, 
there are several key differences.  The bubble rise 
velocity and mass transfer coefficients are not 
functions of bubble radius.  Also, the transfer of 
gases other than oxygen is neglected.  As mentioned 
previously, 
gaseous 
nitrogen 
exchange 
can 
significantly affect bubble size and related properties.  
The effect of salinity gradients on plume dynamics 
was not considered as was done in the Wüest et al. 
(7) model.  Hydrodynamic predictions using the 
model were verified during both laboratory and field 
testing (Supporting Information, Table 1).  However, 
the oxygen transfer portion of the model has not been 
validated with experimental data.

An existing linear bubble plume model was improved, and data collected from a
full-scale diffuser installed in Spring Hollow Reservoir, Virginia, were used to validate
the model. The depth of maximum plume rise was simulated well for two of the three
diffuser tests. Temperature predictions deviated from measured profiles near the maximum
plume rise height, but predicted dissolved oxygen profiles compared very well with
observations. A sensitivity analysis was performed. The gas flow rate had the greatest effect
on predicted plume rise height and induced water flow rate, both of which were directly
proportional to gas flow rate. Oxygen transfer within the hypolimnion was independent
of all parameters except initial bubble radius and was inversely proportional for radii
greater than approximately 1 mm. The results of this work suggest that plume dynamics
and oxygen transfer can successfully be predicted for linear bubble plumes using the
discrete-bubble approach.

Introduction
[2] Bubble plumes are used in a variety of industrial and
environmental applications including mixing in chemical
reactors, stripping of dissolved gases, containment of spills,
prevention of ice formation, protection of harbors from
damaging waves [Fanneløp et al., 1991], and destratifica-
tion of lakes and reservoirs [Schladow, 1992]. In addition to
airlift aerators [Burris et al., 2002] and Speece cones
[McGinnis and Little, 1998], bubble plumes are commonly
used for hypolimnetic aeration and oxygenation, which
preserves stratification of water bodies while adding oxygen
to the deepest layer. Hypolimnetic anoxia negatively affects
the drinking water treatment process, cold-water fisheries,
and water quality downstream of hydropower reservoirs. In
the United States, releases from hydropower reservoirs
typically must comply with state water quality criteria for
minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations [Peterson
et al., 2003]. Oxygen depletion may lead to increases in
hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and phosphorus and the release
of reduced iron and manganese from the sediments. Hydro-
gen sulfide, iron, and manganese in drinking water usually
require additional treatment [Cooke and Carlson, 1989].
Finally, hypoxia can affect sex differentiation and develop-
ment in fish, resulting in male-dominated populations with
reduced reproductive success [Shang et al., 2006].
[3] A bubble plume model to predict oxygen transfer
from linear diffuser systems was presented by McGinnis et
al. [2001], based on the model for a circular diffuser
developed earlier by Wu¨est et al. [1992]. While several
models for point-source or circular bubble plumes have
been proposed [Asaeda and Imberger, 1993; Brevik and
Kluge, 1999; Ditmars and Cederwall, 1974; Fanneløp and
Sjøen, 1980; Johansen, 2000; Kobus, 1968; McDougall,
1978; Milgram, 1983; Rayyan and Speece, 1977; Sahoo and
Luketina, 2003; Schladow, 1992; Wu¨est et al., 1992; Zheng
et al., 2002], less work has been conducted on linear (also
referred to as line, two-dimensional, or planar) bubble
plumes. Kobus [1968] developed one of the first analytical
models for linear bubble plumes, which uses an empirical
correlation to calculate buoyancy flux. Ditmars and Cederwall
[1974] presented a model similar to that of Kobus [1968] but
included bubble slip velocity. Brevik [1977] proposed a
phenomenological theory for two-dimensional bubble
plumes comparable with that of Ditmars and Cederwall
[1974], except that kinetic energy was used to predict
entrainment. Wilkinson [1979] proposed that full-scale
linear plumes could be characterized by a Weber number.
Laureshen and Rowe [1987] presented a model for two-
dimensional bubble plumes in which plume spreading,
entrainment, and momentum amplification were assumed
to be functions of the plume Weber number and empirical
constants. Fanneløp et al. [1991] developed a model for
linear plumes in shallow water and studied the resulting
surface currents and recirculation cells. Last, Brevik and
Kluge [1999] expanded an existing model for linear bubble
plumes to account for vertical turbulence. Although much
insight into plume dynamics was gained, none of these
models for linear or two-dimensional bubble plumes
accounted for ambient stratification or gas transfer. The
first linear bubble plume model to include gas transfer was
presented by McGinnis et al. [2001], who converted the
circular bubble plume model of Wu¨est et al. [1992] to linear
geometry. The incorporation of gas transfer is critical
because the rapid dissolution rate of oxygen, and nitrogen

when compressed air is used, strongly influences the buoy-
ancy of the plume [Wu¨est et al., 1992]. Gas transfer is
especially important in deep water bodies and for weak
plumes because the increased contact time allows greater
gas exchange. Last, the prediction of oxygen addition from
hypolimnetic oxygenation systems is facilitated. Despite
the usefulness of the linear bubble plume model, it has not
yet been validated at full scale and over a range of operating
conditions.
[4] Using extensive, high-spatial-resolution conductivity
and temperature as a function of depth (CTD) transect data
collected in Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR), Virginia,
during diffuser operation in 2003 and 2004, the perfor-
mance of the linear bubble plume model is evaluated. The
motivation for this work includes verification of model
performance prior to use for design and investigation of
critical model parameters through sensitivity analysis. Also,
the accuracy of model predictions for depth of maximum
plume rise (DMPR) and induced water flow rate should be
assessed prior to coupling with lake/reservoir hydrody-
namic and water quality models, such as CE-QUAL-W2
[McGinnis et al., 2001]. In this paper an improved linear
bubble plume model is presented, observations and model
predictions are compared, and results of a sensitivity
analysis are discussed.

Bubble Plumes in Stratified Water Bodies
[5] During hypolimnetic oxygenation with bubble
plumes, compressed gas is continually supplied to diffusers,
usually located immediately above the sediments, and is
allowed to bubble freely. A gas-water plume mixture that is
less dense than the ambient water is created, which causes
the mixture to ascend through the hypolimnion. As the
mixture rises, ambient water is entrained into the plume, and
the plume width increases. The entrained fluid produces a
double-plume structure, consisting of an inner core that
contains the bubble-water mixture surrounded by an outer
annulus that contains plume water relatively free of bubbles
[McDougall, 1978]. As the outer annulus entrains stratified
hypolimnetic water, the plume width increases and the
density decreases. When the negative buoyancy of the
entrained fluid exceeds the positive buoyancy imparted by
the bubbles, the plume detrains water at a rate nearly equal
to that previously entrained [Lemckert and Imberger, 1993].
At this depth, the velocity of the relatively dense water
within the plume decreases to zero, and the plume stops
rising. The detraining plume water then forms an annular
downward flow immediately outside the outer annulus of
the upward flowing plume water. The detraining plume
water entrains ambient water until a depth of neutral buoy-
ancy is reached, where a horizontal intrusion is created into
the hypolimnion [Asaeda and Imberger, 1993]. The undis-
solved bubbles remaining in the bubble-water mixture
separate from the inner core flow and continue to rise to
the surface, repeating the entire process.
3.
Linear Bubble Plume Model
[6] The linear bubble plume model utilizes the discrete-
bubble approach, which has also been applied to the airlift
aerator and Speece cone and was recently reviewed in detail
by Singleton and Little [2006]. The linear bubble plume
model is composed of horizontally integrated equations
based on the conservation of mass, momentum, and heat.
Eight flux equations are solved simultaneously to predict
water flow rate, plume temperature, oxygen and nitrogen
transfer and concentration, salinity, and plume rise height,
given diffuser geometry and depth, applied gas flow rate,
and initial bubble size (Tables 1 and 2). The model accounts
for density stratification due to vertical temperature and
salinity gradients. Entrainment is assumed to be propor-
tional to the local (with respect to depth) plume water
velocity and perimeter. Bubble size varies as the bubbles
rise due to expansion and dissolution, and bubble slip
velocity and gas transfer coefficients are functions of
bubble radius [Wu¨est et al., 1992]. Also, Henry’s constants
for oxygen and nitrogen are functions of temperature
[Wu¨est et al., 1992]. The bubble plume model equations
were originally developed by Wu¨est et al. [1992] for
circular geometry but were modified by McGinnis et al.
[2001] for the linear geometry of the system installed in
SHR. The equations that include the spreading coefficient
() were recently refined [Singleton and Little, 2005] to
more accurately reflect the geometry of the plume at the
ends of the linear diffuser (Tables 1 and 2), which is
approximated in plan view as a long, thin rectangle.
Additional refinements to the model of McGinnis et al.
[2001], which are detailed in the following paragraphs,
include use of a correlation to calculate initial bubble size
[McGinnis and Little, 2002], correction of the entrainment
coefficient (a) and  for top-hat profiles, and use of a
Froude number (Fr) to calculate initial water velocity
[Fischer et al., 1979; Wu¨est et al., 1992]. Also, water
quality profiles from the plume near-field, as opposed to
the reservoir far-field, were used as boundary conditions
[McGinnis et al., 2004].
[7] The entrainment coefficient and  were set at 0.11 and
0.93, respectively. These values were derived by Fanneløp
et al. [1991] by fitting Gaussian profiles to laboratory data
and were modified for the top-hat profile assumption of the
model using [Fanneløp and Sjøen, 1980]

where the subscripts T and G refer to top-hat and Gaussian
profiles, respectively. For simplicity, top-hat or uniform
profiles are assumed for water velocity, temperature,
salinity, dissolved and gaseous constituents, and bubble
velocity [Wu¨est et al., 1992]. Other model assumptions are
as follows: (1) The linear plume width W for temperature
and dissolved constituents is equal to the width of the plume
velocity profile, whereas the bubbles are confined to an
inner core of width W ( < 1); (2) ambient currents are
negligible; (3) the diffuser produces bubbles at a constant
rate and uniform size that are evenly distributed over the
cross section of initial width Wo; (4) bubble coalescence is
neglected; (5) initial water properties of the plume are those
of ambient water at the diffuser depth; and (6) exchange of
gases other than oxygen and nitrogen is not considered.
[8] The model predictions are strongly dependent on the
initial plume conditions and the plume boundary conditions

detailed by Wu¨est et al. [1992], except for the following
deviations. Initial bubble size is calculated using the corre-
lation developed by McGinnis and Little [2002] for the type
of linear diffuser installed in SHR:
d3;2 ¼ 1:12 þ 0:938q:
ð3Þ
The correlation was determined using measured Sauter-
mean bubble diameter (d3,2) values of 1.1–2.2 mm
collected over actual unit gas flow rates q of 0.08–
0.88 m2/h at the diffuser.
[9] For the circular bubble plume model, Wu¨est et al.
[1992] proposed that the induced vertical water velocity v
at the diffuser depth is equivalent to the initial plume
water velocity. To estimate the initial velocity, Wu¨est et al.
[1992] defined a densimetric Fr and utilized a relationship
between the local Richardson number (Ri) and Fr derived
by Fischer et al. [1979] for single-phase, round buoyant
jets discharging vertically. The circular bubble plume
model was recently validated by McGinnis et al. [2004],
so a similar procedure was used to determine the initial plume
velocity for the linear bubble plume. Corresponding equa-
tions for Fr were derived for planar or linear plumes using
relationships presented by Fischer et al. [1979] to obtain

where g is gravitational acceleration, ra is the ambient water
density, and rp is the bubble plume density. The local Ri for
planar jets has a constant value of 0.735 at distances from
the source where the flow is more like a plume [Fischer et
al., 1979]. Consequently, Fr for a planar or linear plume is
equal to 1.26, except close to the source. Wu¨est et al. [1992]
assumed that the bubble slip velocity near the source was
relatively low, so the initial Froude number (Fro) should be
equal to the value for a single-phase plume. Unlike the
circular plume model, the Fr profiles predicted by the linear
bubble plume model continually increase with depth for the
diffuser installed in SHR (not shown). For Fro  2.0, the
plume velocity initially increases with decreasing depth
immediately above the linear diffuser (Figure 1a). This
effect was also predicted by Fanneløp and Webber [2003]
for buoyant plumes rising from areal sources, where a point
of maximum velocity occurred above the source. Addition-
ally, the plume neck (point of minimum radius or width) is
always below the point of maximum velocity in the plume
[Fanneløp and Webber, 2003]. A neck is not predicted for
the linear bubble plume when Fro = 2.0 (Figure 1b).
However, necking or contraction will only occur when the
momentum immediately above the source is relatively low
and/or the entrainment coefficient is relatively low
[Fanneløp and Webber, 2003]. Also, Wu¨est et al. [1992]
reasoned that a plume from an open source (diffuser above
sediments) may not contract because initially entrained
water is not obstructed. Therefore Fro for an open source
will likely be higher than that for a closed source (diffuser
resting on sediments). Because the linear diffuser in SHR
is an open source (Figure 2), Fro for the linear bubble
plume was assumed to be 2.0, and a sensitivity analysis
was conducted to determine the effect of varying Fro.
[10] The differential flux equations of the linear bubble
plume model (Table 2) were solved numerically using the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Further information on
the general solution procedure, equations of state, and
model assumptions is provided by Wu¨est et al. [1992] and
McGinnis et al. [2004]. The model calculations are only
valid over the plume rise height, up to the DMPR. When the
plume stops rising, a secondary plume may form above as
bubbles that are not completely dissolved continue to rise
[Asaeda and Imberger, 1993; McDougall, 1978; Schladow,
1992]. This phenomenon can occur when a bubble plume is
released into strong density stratification.

conducted using a full-scale linear diffuser (Figure 2)
installed in Spring Hollow Reservoir, Virginia (Figure 3).
Constructed in 1995, SHR is a small monomictic, mesotro-
phic side-stream reservoir that is generally stratified from
May to December. The reservoir is managed by the Western
Virginia Water Authority and serves as one of the principle
drinking water sources for Roanoke County. The water
body has a maximum depth of 65 m and a maximum
surface elevation of 431 m. The approximate surface area
and volume are 0.54 km2 and 12.4  106 m3, respectively.
To prevent anoxia in the hypolimnion and the associated
deterioration of raw water quality, a linear diffuser equipped
with fine-bubble porous hoses was installed in 1997
(Figure 3). The 305-m-long diffuser can be supplied with
compressed air or pure oxygen at various gas flow rates and
is located in the deepest portion of the reservoir (368–
372 m elevation). On the basis of an average surface
elevation of 430 m, the depth of the diffuser during testing
ranged from 58 to 62 m along its length. Table 3 provides
the diffuser operating parameters in 2003 and 2004.
[12] Diffuser tests were performed in 2003 using com-
pressed air (21% O2) supplied at a high gas flow rate
(45 Nm3/h average) during 29 June to 14 July and pure oxygen
(97% O2) supplied at a low flow rate (11 Nm3/h average)
during 14–26 August. A third test was conducted in
2004 using pure oxygen, but at a higher gas flow rate
(40 Nm3/h maximum) during 22 October to 5 November. In
2003, the diffuser quickly mixed the rather small hypolim-
netic volume during both tests, and the water quality con-
ditions on the dates of data collection (2 July and 17 August
for compressed air and pure oxygen, respectively) were by
that time relatively homogeneous as a result of plume-
induced mixing. One of the primary objectives of the 2004
experiments was to maximize the plume signature in the
hypolimnion and to increase confidence in the linear
plume model validation under a different set of boundary
conditions. In 2004, the data were therefore collected on
24 October, soon after start of diffuser operation. Addition-
ally, the 2004 test was performed later in the stratified season
to maximize the ambient DO and temperature gradients in
the hypolimnion.
[13] To establish appropriate boundary conditions for the
plume model, characterization of the plume near-field
environment is necessary [McGinnis et al., 2004]. Therefore
the data collected included numerous high-spatial-resolution
CTD (Sea-Bird model SBE 19plus; 4-Hz sampling rate)
transects measured almost daily before, during, and after
diffuser operation. The CTD profiler was also equipped
with a DO probe (1.4-s response time measured at 20C).
Profiles were obtained laterally across the diffuser at 0.5-m
increments for 0–10 m, 2-m increments for 10–20 m, and
5-m increments for 20–40 m from the centerline of the
diffuser in both directions (Figures 3 and 4). (The diffuser
centerline location is shifted to the left for 2004 (Figures 4e
and 4f) because the diffuser was repositioned earlier in the
year. Also, the operational length of the diffuser was
decreased for that year (Table 3).)
[14] The geometry of SHR affects the extent and rate of
circulation within the hypolimnion induced by the bubble
plume. Because of the relatively small size of SHR, oper-
ation of the linear diffuser created uniform conditions below
the thermocline within days after startup. While SHR
bathymetry influences plume-induced mixing in the hypo-
limnion, the effect on short-term plume operation is negli-
gible because the time that individual bubbles spend in the
hypolimnion is of the order of minutes. The bubbles and
resulting plume experience a pseudo steady state with
respect to ambient conditions. Effects on data collection
due to the ends of the linear diffuser were assumed to be
negligible because the lateral profile location was over
150 m from a diffuser end (Figure 3), and the diffuser is
designed to release a uniform gas flow along its length.
4.2.
Observations and Model Validation
[15] Plume rise height, spreading, and constituent profiles
predicted by the linear bubble plume model were compared
with experimental observations. Critical model input param-
eters for the three test conditions (2 July 2003, 17 August
2003, and 23 October 2004) are shown in Table 3. The
boundary conditions were obtained from averaged near-
field lateral profiles [McGinnis et al., 2004] (±2 m and ±1 m
from plume centerline for 2003 and 2004, respectively) and
differed significantly between 2003 and 2004 (Figure 5).
(The presence of two thermoclines in 2003 is due to the
pumped reservoir inflow that discharges at 396-m elevation,
which corresponded to approximately 34-m depth during
diffuser testing. The lower thermocline delineates the effec-
tive hypolimnion for the oxygenation system.)
[16] Measured contours of temperature and DO are
shown in Figure 4, along with corresponding model pre-
dictions for plume width and the DMPR. The actual plume
boundaries are not well defined in the contour plots, so
comparison with predicted plume widths is difficult. The
lack of distinct plume boundaries was due to the almost well
mixed conditions in the hypolimnion as a result of diffuser

operation, particularly for 2003 (Figures 4a–4d). Also, use
of compressed air did not produce a strong DO plume
signature for the July test compared with the August and
October tests with pure oxygen. The actual plume rise
height is easier to distinguish, especially in the DO contours
for August and October. The predicted depths of maximum
plume rise are 38.2, 46.1, and 48.8 m for July, August, and
October, respectively. For July and October, the DMPR is
simulated well by the model (Figures 4a, 4b, 4e, and 4f).
However, the model appears to underestimate the plume rise
height for August, when the gas flow rate was compara-
tively low (Table 3). The under-predicted DMPR may have
been due to an overestimated value for a. In a detailed study
of round plumes, Milgram [1983] found that a is directly
proportional to the plume gas holdup or fraction. However,
the linear bubble-plume model assumes that a is constant
(Table 3).
[17] The structure of the plumes is similar to those
observed by Asaeda and Imberger [1993] for round bubble
plumes in weak stratification (Figure 4). Depending on the
gas flow rate and stratification strength, three types of
horizontal intrusions from the plume were reported. The
pattern of the DO contours for October (Figure 4f) closely
resembles type 1, which corresponds to a high gas flow rate
or weak stratification [Asaeda and Imberger, 1993]. This is
similar to a single plume impinging on a free surface, which
is analogous to the thermocline in SHR. Although the
plume for July is not easily discerned from the temperature
or DO contours, the structure is most likely similar to a type
1 plume. The July plume appears to detrain primarily at the
lower thermocline with one strong intrusion, as evidenced
by accumulation of higher oxygenated water near the top of
the plume (Figure 4b). The plume for August is best
classified as type 3, which is for low gas flow rates or
strong density stratification [Asaeda and Imberger, 1993].
Type 3 plumes do not have steady intrusions, but instead are
characterized by alternating, collapsing eddies that cause the
plume to meander.
[18] Referring to the October test (Figure 4f), the higher
DO concentrations at lower depths adjacent to both sides of
the plume were likely the result of detrained water that sinks
past the equilibrium depth due to momentum. The temper-
ature isotherms were also depressed immediately beside the
plume (Figure 4e). This phenomenon was also observed by
McGinnis et al. [2004]. The DO concentration immediately
above the predicted DMPR and near the vertical plume
centerline for October 2004 is higher than the ambient
concentration (Figure 4f). This could have been caused by
the formation of a secondary plume above the DMPR
resulting from incompletely dissolved bubbles. The model
estimates that the bubble size at the top of the first plume
was about 5  105 m for October 2004, which is relatively
large compared with July 2003 and August 2003 (Figure 6f).
These undissolved bubbles could have created a secondary
plume, which entrained oxygenated water from the detrain-
ment of the first plume and carried it higher into the water
column.
[19] Vertical profiles of constituents and properties within
the plumes were also predicted for the three diffuser tests
(Figure 6). For the July test with compressed air, the higher
gas flux creates a greater buoyancy flux and a higher initial
plume water velocity (Figure 6d). Also, the concentration
driving force for oxygen transfer is lower compared with
pure oxygen, which decreases the rate of bubble dissolution
with depth (Figure 6f). These effects result in a higher
DMPR for July compared with August (Figures 4 and 6).
The model predictions for 2004 differ from those of 2003
because of the differing boundary conditions (Figure 5). The
plume rise height for the October test with pure oxygen is
less than that for August, even though the gas flux was more
than tripled (Table 3). The ambient temperature, and hence
density, stratification was stronger in 2004, which provided
greater negative buoyancy to decrease plume momentum.
The stronger ambient density stratification also caused the
plume velocity to decrease more rapidly with depth in
2004 despite a higher initial velocity from the diffuser
(Figure 6d). The lower plume rise height in October resulted
in lower plume water flow rates than July (Figure 6e), even
with comparable gas fluxes applied (Table 3).
[20] Average temperature, DO, and density profiles
within the plumes were also measured (Figures 6a–6c).
The temperature, and consequently density, predictions for
July and October deviate from the measured profiles where
the plumes reach the top of the hypolimnion (Figures 6a
and 6c), or where the rate of plume spreading is greatest
(Figure 4). The model underpredicts the final plume
temperature by approximately 0.3 and 0.2C for July
and October, respectively. One reason for the discrepancy

may be that the model assumes a is constant. In addition
to the dependence on plume gas holdup, Milgram [1983]
also found that a for a circular plume is directly propor-
tional to the local plume radius. As the plume approaches
its maximum rise height, the width increases rapidly
(Figure 4). If linear plume dynamics are similar to circular
plumes, then a for linear plumes may also increase as the
plume width increases. Additionally, the boundary profiles
selected may not accurately reflect the actual ambient
conditions immediately adjacent to the plume along its
entire rise height. Measured vertical CTD profiles at the
estimated plume width were averaged and used for boundary
conditions. However, the plume width varies greatly with
depth (Figure 4), so use of vertical profiles at a single lateral
distance from the diffuser is not appropriate. Also, the
average plume width was visually estimated from the
temperature and DO contour plots (Figure 4), but the actual
plume boundaries are not well defined.
[21] The model predicts the plume DO profiles well for
all three diffuser tests (Figure 6b). For July and August the
model characterizes the initial increase in DO immediately
above the diffuser quite accurately. The initial rapid increase
in DO for August and October is due to the higher oxygen
saturation concentration at depth with the use of pure
oxygen. The high hydrostatic pressure causes the oxygen
transfer rate to be almost independent of the ambient DO
concentration at the depth of diffuser. By contrast, the initial
DO increase for the July test with compressed air is more
modest (Figure 6b). The shape of the predicted DO profile
for October differs somewhat from the experimental data,
even though the final values at the DMPR differ by only
0.3 g/m3. The hypolimnion and hence the plume near-field
were more heterogeneous in 2004 than 2003, which may
have contributed to the overprediction at lower depths if
the selected boundary profiles did not accurately represent
water entrained into the plume.
[22] Another source of inaccuracy could be the correla-
tion equation used to calculate initial bubble size (equation
(3)). This relationship was developed using data collected
over actual air flow rates per unit length of diffuser of 0.08–
0.88 m2/h [McGinnis and Little, 2002]. The actual gas flow
rates per unit length of diffuser for the July, August, and
October tests were 0.019, 0.0063, and 0.024 m2/h, respec-
tively. Therefore the initial bubble diameters used in the
model were extrapolated beyond the valid correlation range.

Sensitivity Analysis
[23] A sensitivity analysis was performed with the linear
bubble plume model to determine the effects on plume rise
height, oxygen transfer efficiency, and induced water flow
rate, because these parameters are important for design and
operation of hypolimnetic aeration/oxygenation systems.
Parameter perturbation was used, in which input variables
are independently adjusted to determine their individual
effects on model predictions. The model variables investi-
gated are either difficult to measure or can be controlled
through system design or operation (Table 3). Currently, a
and  for the linear plume model are empirical constants
[Fanneløp et al., 1991], and the initial plume water velocity
is calculated using a densimetric Fr [Wu¨est et al., 1992].
The initial plume area, gas flow rate, and, to a lesser extent,
initial bubble size can be controlled through diffuser design
and operation. The sensitivity of model predictions to
ambient dissolved nitrogen was also examined for the
standard case using compressed air (2 July 2003). The
model assumes that the background dissolved nitrogen
concentration is equivalent to the saturated value at atmo-
spheric partial pressure and the average hypolimnetic water
temperature.
[24] The DMPR is most influenced by gas flow rate and
initial bubble radius (Figures 7e and 7f). The gas flow rate is
directly related to the density of the plume bubble-water
mixture and subsequently the positive buoyancy and up-
ward momentum of the plume (Table 2). For gas flow rates
greater than approximately 100 Nm3/h, the plume rise
height is controlled more by the depth of the thermocline
in SHR (Figure 5a). As the plume rise height approaches the
thermocline, further increases in the buoyancy and momen-
tum fluxes can not overcome the strong ambient density
stratification. The 2003 predictions are more a function of
Figure 4.

gas flow rate than those for October 2004 because of
differing boundary conditions (Figure 5).
[25] The plume rise height is moderately sensitive to
initial bubble radius (Figure 7f). For initial radii less than
about 1 mm, the DMPRs are nearly independent of bubble
size. As initial bubble sizes increase, the plumes ascend
higher and reach a maximum height for a radius of about
6 mm for each diffuser test. The shapes of the curves can
be attributed to the dependence of bubble rise velocity
and gas transfer coefficients on bubble radius [Wu¨est et
al., 1992]. The DMPR predictions for August are more
sensitive to initial bubble radius than those for July and
October (Figure 7f). The plume on 17 August 2003 did
not have sufficient buoyancy and momentum to rise to the
thermocline because a relatively low gas flow rate was
applied (Figure 4c and Table 3). By contrast, the plume
dynamics for July and October were influenced to a greater
degree by the thermocline, which in effect damped the
sensitivity of plume rise height to the initial bubble radius.
[26] The predicted DMPR for the linear bubble plume is
virtually independent of Fro and  over the ranges analyzed
(Figures 7b and 7c). The plume rise height is moderately
sensitive to a. Entrainment into the plume is a function of
plume size, water velocity, and a (Table 1), and entrainment
of ambient water decelerates the plume. Plume rise is
influenced to a somewhat greater degree by the initial plume
area. As the plume area is increased, the buoyancy flux
decreases because the gas flow rate is constant. Plume rise
height was unaffected by variations in the ambient dissolved
nitrogen concentration from 50 to 200% saturation in the
hypolimnion for the 2 July 2003 diffuser test. Similar to
the analysis for DMPR, induced water flow rate at the top
of the plume was found to be insensitive to Fro and  and
somewhat more sensitive to a and the initial plume area
(results not shown). Plume water flow rate is most
influenced by gas flow rate and initial bubble radius.
Higher gas flow rates produce greater buoyancy and
momentum fluxes, which results in greater plume rise
heights and increased entrainment.
[27] Oxygen transfer efficiency (total mass of oxygen
transferred relative to initial mass of oxygen in bubbles)
within the hypolimnion was independent of all parameters
except initial bubble radius, decreasing from nearly 100% to
around 20% for air and pure oxygen as the initial radii
increased from approximately 1 mm to 1 cm (Figure 8).
Oxygen transfer can continue above the DMPR if the
bubbles are not dissolved. However, secondary plumes are
not accounted for in the model. Even though undissolved
bubbles at the top of the plume may continue to transfer
oxygen during ascent, the oxygen may not be added at the
desired depth (i.e., below the thermocline). A local mini-
mum with respect to induced water flow rate at the top of
the plume is predicted for a bubble radius of about 1 mm for
the conditions in SHR (not shown). This suggests that while
maximum oxygen transfer efficiency can be achieved with a
1-mm initial bubble radius, vertical water circulation, and
hence oxygen distribution in the hypolimnion, will not be
optimized. As the bubble radius is increased from 1 mm,
induced water flow rate increases as well for radii up to
5 mm, but oxygen transfer efficiency decreases rapidly
within this range (Figure 8).

Comparison of Linear and Circular Bubble
Plume Models

cular bubble plume models is the plume geometry. For a

given plume cross-sectional area, the perimeter of a linear
plume is much greater than for a circular or round plume.
The initial estimated plume area and perimeter of the linear
diffuser in SHR for July 2003 was about 50 m2 and 600 m,
respectively (Table 3). This corresponds to an equivalent
radius and perimeter of approximately 4 m and 25 m,
respectively, for a circular plume. In this case, the perimeter
of the linear plume is 24 times greater than for the circular
plume. For both the linear and circular plume models,
entrainment of ambient water is directly proportional to
local plume perimeter, local plume water velocity, and a
(Table 1). The larger perimeter of the linear plume greatly
increases ambient entrainment, which contributes to the
negative buoyancy of the plume and causes the plume to
decelerate more rapidly. This results in a lower plume rise
height compared with the circular plume.
[29] The sensitivity of the linear bubble plume model to
various parameters was comparable to results for the circu-
lar bubble plume model analysis. Gas flow rate had the
greatest effect on DMPR predictions by both models, and
the linear plume model was less sensitive to initial bubble
radius than the circular plume model was [Wu¨est et al.,
1992]. The latter may be due to differences between
temperature boundary conditions, which caused plume
dynamics in SHR to be more influenced by thermocline
depth. Initial bubble size greatly affected oxygen transfer
efficiency for both diffuser geometries, decreasing rapidly
as the radii increased beyond 1 mm and 3 mm for the linear
and circular plumes, respectively. Both the linear and
circular plume model predictions for DMPR were relatively
insensitive to Fro and initial plume area (Figure 7 and Wu¨est
et al. [1992]). However, circular model predictions for
DMPR were more sensitive to a. Overall, the linear model
was less sensitive to input parameters than the circular
model, but this insensitivity is probably due to the relatively

Summary and Conclusions
[30] In the current work, the linear bubble plume model
of McGinnis et al. [2001] was improved, and the updated
model was evaluated using data collected from a full-scale
hypolimnetic oxygenation system installed in Spring
Hollow Reservoir, Virginia. Three diffuser experiments
were conducted using compressed air and pure oxygen over
a range of flow rates. Predicted plume rise height, spread-
ing, and constituent profiles were compared with experi-
mental observations. For July 2003 and October 2004, the
DMPR was simulated well by the model. However, the
model underestimated the plume rise height for August
2003, when the gas flow rate was comparatively low. The
model underpredicted the final plume temperature by ap-
proximately 0.3 and 0.2C for July 2003 and October
2004, respectively. The model predicted the plume DO

profiles very well for all three diffuser tests, including
simulating the initial rapid transfer of oxygen immediately
above the diffuser.
[31] A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine
the effect of various model input parameters. The DMPR
and induced water flow rate were most influenced by gas
flow rate and initial bubble radius, moderately sensitive to a
and the initial plume area, and insensitive to Fro, , and
ambient dissolved nitrogen. Oxygen transfer within the
hypolimnion was independent of all parameters except
initial bubble radius, decreasing from nearly 100% to
around 20% for air and pure oxygen as the initial radii
increased from approximately 1 mm to 1 cm.
[32] The linear bubble plume model for hypolimnetic
oxygenation has been successfully validated. The model
can be used to design lake and reservoir oxygenation
systems and to optimize existing systems to maximize
oxygen addition. Application of the linear plume model
requires knowledge of the gas flow rate, initial bubble
radius, initial plume area, and near-field constituent profiles
(boundary conditions). Additionally, several empirical
parameters must be estimated including a and . Even
though all of the model inputs may not be known with
certainty for a given aeration or oxygenation system, the
model can be used for preliminary design and coarse
optimization. Also, plume rise height, water flow rate, and
oxygen transfer efficiency were found to be primarily
dependent on gas flow rate and initial bubble radius.
[33] Operation of bubble plumes for hypolimnetic oxy-
genation usually alters the ambient temperature and DO
conditions of a water body. Plume dynamics and oxygen
transfer are strongly related to the near-field water column
properties, establishing a feedback loop that continually
changes plume dynamics. This complex plume-lake inter-
action should be accounted for in the design and operation
of bubble plume diffusers. McGinnis et al. [2001] per-
formed a preliminary coupling of the linear bubble plume
model with an existing reservoir model, CE-QUAL-W2
[Cole and Wells, 2003], and obtained encouraging results.
Efforts are currently under way to further develop the
coupled model to predict plume performance and the near-
and far-field reservoir responses. In the absence of near-
field boundary profiles, far-field or simulated constituent
profiles can be used to provide a reasonable estimate of
plume performance.

A model for a linear bubble plume used for hypolimnetic oxygenation was coupled
with a three‐dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the complex interaction
between bubble plumes and the large‐scale processes of transport and mixing. The coupled
model accurately simulated the evolution of dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature fields
that occurred during two full‐scale diffuser tests in a water supply reservoir. The prediction
of asymmetric circulation cells laterally and longitudinally on both sides of the linear
diffuser was due to the uneven reservoir bathymetry. Simulation of diffuser operation
resulted in baroclinic pressure gradients, which caused vertical oscillations above the
hypolimnion and contributed to distribution of plume detrainment upstream and
downstream of the diffuser. On the basis of a first‐order variance analysis, the largest
source of uncertainty for both predicted DO and temperature was the model bathymetry,
which accounted for about 90% of the overall uncertainty. Because the oxygen addition
rate was 4 times the sediment oxygen uptake (SOU) rate, DO predictions were not
sensitive to SOU. In addition to bathymetry, the momentum assigned to plume entrainment
and detrainment is a significant source of uncertainty in the coupled model structure and
appreciably affects the predicted intensity of mixing and lake circulation. For baseline
runs, the entrainment and detrainment velocities were assumed to be half of the velocities
through the flux face of the grid cells. Additional research on appropriate values of the
plume detrainment momentum for the coupled model is required.

Introduction
[2] Hypolimnetic hypoxia, the depletion of dissolved
oxygen (DO) in the bottom water of lakes and reservoirs,
can result in severe water quality degradation. Anoxia
within lake sediments can increase the rate of soluble
phosphorus release [Boström et al., 1982], triggering the
growth of nuisance algal blooms [French and Petticrew,
2007]. Oxygen depletion within the hypolimnion may also
lead to increases in reduced species such as hydrogen sulfide
and the release of soluble iron and manganese from the
sediments, which typically require treatment in raw water
used for potable purposes [Cooke and Carlson, 1989]. The
effects of low DO levels on fish have been studied for
decades and include mass mortalities, ecological disruption,
physiological stress, and modification of complex behaviors
such as schooling, swimming, and reproduction [Pollock
and Dubé, 2007]. Methylation of inorganic mercury by
microorganisms to a soluble and more bioavailable form is
enhanced under anoxic conditions [Mailman et al., 2006].
Last, anoxic water has been shown to greatly increase the
release of major greenhouse gasses such as methane and
carbon dioxide from lake sediments [Liikanen et al., 2002].
[3] Bubble plumes are commonly used for hypolimnetic
aeration and oxygenation, adding oxygen to the deeper
water while preserving stratification [Singleton and Little,
2006]. The plume is in intimate contact with the ambient
water and is strongly influenced by the local density gra-
dient. While bubble plumes are successful at adding oxygen,
the added energy may induce large‐scale hypolimnetic
mixing. Plume‐induced mixing alters the density structure
of the reservoir, while plume performance depends strongly
on the density gradient, establishing a feedback loop that
continually changes plume behavior [McGinnis et al., 2004].
Mixing may partially erode the thermocline and subsequently
lead to warming of the hypolimnion and even premature
destratification of the reservoir. Higher hypolimnetic tem-
peratures and plume‐induced mixing may also be responsible
for increased sediment oxygen uptake (SOU). A number of
studies have reported that small increases in water velocity
above lake sediments can significantly increase SOU [Arega
and Lee, 2005; Bryant et al., 2010; Hondzo, 1998; Josiam
and Stefan, 1999; Lorke et al., 2003]. Because the sediment
is the largest sink of oxygen in most reservoirs, the effect of
plume‐induced mixing must be included to avoid serious
undersizing of oxygenation systems. The specific plume‐
induced mixing mechanisms should be identified and incor-
porated in a coupled bubble plume–reservoir model for
successful design and operation.

[4] A number of models for predicting plume dynamics
and/or oxygen transfer from bubble plumes have been devel-
oped [Singleton and Little, 2006], but less research has focused
on modeling the interaction between bubble plumes and
ambient water bodies. Most of the existing coupled bubble
plume–reservoir models involve whole‐lake artificial circula-
tion or destratification and do not account for mass transfer
from the bubbles [Hodges and Dallimore, 2006; Imerito, 2007;
Johnson et al., 2000; Schladow, 1993; Zic and Stefan, 1994].
Estimating oxygen transfer is critical to predicting the perfor-
mance of hypolimnetic oxygenation systems. Furthermore, all
of the models except one (ELCOM) assume homogeneous
conditions in the horizontal direction, ignoring the fact that
near‐field conditions determine the operational behavior of
bubble plumes, as shown by McGinnis et al. [2004]. Even
though ELCOM is three dimensional, use of the model for
destratification has not been validated in the literature.
[5] McGinnis et al. [2004] conducted a detailed analysis
of the plume‐lake interaction in Lake Hallwil, Switzerland.
Entrainment occurred from the near field, which was where
detrained water accumulated over tens of meters from the
plume, as opposed to the far field as previously thought.
Because entrainment was mostly from the near field, plume
temperature
and
constituent
concentrations
depended
strongly on that region, which was created by the plume
itself
and
continually
evolving.
Currently,
near‐field
boundary conditions cannot be predicted for bubble plume
design and must either be measured or assumed. Bravo et al.
[2007] used a comprehensive three‐dimensional model,
FLUENT, and constructed a two‐fluid dispersed model to
simulate the dynamics of bubble plumes. The extension of
this model to large‐scale and long‐term simulations, though,
is not straightforward and is computationally expensive.
[6] To address these shortcomings, this work presents the
coupling of a linear bubble plume model that includes gas
transfer with a three‐dimensional hydrodynamic and trans-
port model for long‐term basin‐scale simulations in lakes
and reservoirs. The coupled models are used to predict
plume dynamics, induced mixing, and oxygen addition from
a linear diffuser used for hypolimnetic oxygenation. In this
paper, the components of the coupled model and the cou-
pling procedure are described, field data from a full‐scale
system are compared to model predictions, a sensitivity
analysis of the coupled model is presented, and sources of
model uncertainty are discussed.

Methods
2.1.
Approach
[7] A model capable of simulating the complex interac-
tion between bubble plumes and basin‐scale hydrodynamic
processes has been developed by combining a three‐
dimensional (3‐D) hydrodynamic model of lake transport
and mixing [Smith, 2006] and a steady one‐dimensional
(1‐D) linear bubble plume model presented by Singleton et al.
[2007], which is based on the circular bubble plume model
originally proposed by Wüest et al. [1992]. The particular
procedures adopted to couple the 1‐D steady state bubble
plume model and the 3‐D hydrodynamic model are outlined
and justified in this section.
2.2. Linear Bubble Plume Model
[8] The linear bubble plume model was recently validated
by Singleton et al. [2007] using full‐scale diffuser data
collected from Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR), Virginia,
United States. The model uses the discrete‐bubble approach,
which has been successfully applied to other hypolimnetic
oxygenation devices and was reviewed in detail by Singleton
and Little [2006]. The linear bubble plume model is derived
from the circular model of Wüest et al. [1992] and is com-
posed of horizontally integrated equations based on the
conservation of mass, momentum, and heat. Eight flux
equations (Tables 1 and 2) are solved simultaneously to
predict water flow rate, temperature, oxygen and nitrogen
transfer and concentration, salinity, and rise height, given
diffuser geometry and depth, applied gas flow rate, and
initial bubble size [Singleton et al., 2007]. The model
accounts for vertical density gradients due to temperature
and salinity. Entrainment is assumed to be proportional
to the local (with respect to depth) plume water velocity.
Bubble size varies as the bubbles rise due to expansion and
dissolution, and bubble slip velocity and gas transfer coef-
ficients are functions of bubble radius [Wüest et al., 1992].
Henry’s constants for oxygen and nitrogen are functions of
temperature [Wüest et al., 1992]. The bubble plume model
equations were originally developed by Wüest et al. [1992]
for circular geometry, but were modified by McGinnis et al.
[2001] for the linear geometry of the system installed in
SHR. Singleton et al. [2007] improved the linear bubble
plume model by use of a correlation to calculate initial
bubble size [McGinnis and Little, 2002], correction of the
entrainment coefficient (a) and spreading coefficient (l) for
top hat profiles [Fanneløp and Sjøen, 1980], and use of
a Froude number (Fr) to calculate initial water velocity

[Fischer et al., 1979; Wüest et al., 1992]. Except as noted
previously, initial conditions for the bubble plume model
were determined as detailed by Wüest et al. [1992]. The a
and l were set at 0.11 and 0.93, respectively [Fanneløp
et al., 1991]. The initial Fr for the linear bubble plume
was taken as 2.0 [Singleton et al., 2007]. Ambient vertical
profiles of temperature and DO were used for plume
boundary conditions and salinity was not modeled. Addi-
tional details about the bubble plume model are given by
Singleton et al. [2007].
[9] For this work, the plume model was only applied over
the plume rise height up to the first detrainment depth,
which is referred to hereafter as the depth of maximum
plume rise (DMPR). For hypolimnetic oxygenation diffu-
sers, the depth of maximum plume rise typically corre-
sponds to the top of the hypolimnion. When the plume stops
rising, a secondary plume may form above as bubbles that
are not completely dissolved continue to rise [Asaeda and
Imberger, 1993; McDougall, 1978; Schladow, 1992]. The
formation of plumes above the first detrainment depth was
not considered in this analysis.
2.3. Hydrodynamic Transport and Mixing Model
[10] The three‐dimensional free surface hydrodynamic
model used in the coupling exercise has been extensively
validated against analytical solutions and field observations
collected in a number of lakes [Rueda and Schladow, 2003;
Rueda and Cowen, 2005]. The model is based on the
continuity equation for incompressible fluids, the Reynolds‐
averaged form of the Navier‐Stokes equations for momen-
tum, and the transport equation for temperature. The gov-
erning equations are first posed in layer‐averaged form by
integrating over the height of a series of horizontal layers
separated by level planes. In layer‐averaged form, the layer‐
integrated volumetric transports replace velocities as the
dependent variables, so that the depth‐integrated continuity
equation that is used in the solution for the water surface
elevation is linear. This approach helps to ensure that mass
and momentum are strictly conserved in the model [Smith,
2006].
The
layer‐averaged
momentum
equations
are
solved using a semi‐implicit, three‐level, iterative leapfrog‐
trapezoidal finite difference scheme on a staggered Carte-
sian grid. Turbulent mixing is represented in the 3‐D model
using diffusion‐like terms. A Laplacian operator with con-
stant mixing coefficients (horizontal eddy viscosity Ah or
diffusivity Dh) is used in the model to represent horizontal
mixing of momentum and scalars (see equations (2)–(5)).
The quasi‐equilibrium turbulent energy model of Galperin
et al. [1988], based on the Mellor and Yamada level 2.5
turbulence closure [Mellor and Yamada, 1974] and modi-
fied by Kantha and Clayson [1994], is used to calculate the
vertical turbulent mixing coefficients Av and Dv. The dis-
crete forms of the two governing equations existing in the
turbulence submodel, one for turbulent kinetic energy and
another for an eddy length scale, are only solved during the
first iteration during each time step [Rueda et al., 2005]. It is
from the estimates of turbulent kinetic energy and length
scales that Av is calculated. The scalar transport equations
are solved using a two‐level, operator‐splitting and semi‐
implicit scheme, in which only vertical diffusion is dis-
cretized implicitly. The 1‐D advection terms in the transport
equation are discretized with flux limiter methods [Durran,
1999]. The corrected fluxes are constructed with the
monotone upstream differencing scheme, the Lax‐Wendroff
second‐order method, and the Van Leer MC limiter. Addi-
tional details of the hydrodynamic model can be found in
[Smith, 2006].
2.4.
Coupling Procedures
[11] Operation of the linear bubble plume in the reservoir
is simulated in the hydrodynamic model as a series of water
columns in which water is relocated from the lower cells,
where ambient water is entrained into the plume, into the
cells at the top of the plume (the DMPR) where oxygenated
water is detrained. Relocation of water is simulated by
considering sources and sinks in each water column that
contains the linear diffuser. The governing equations solved
by the coupled bubble plume–hydrodynamic model, incor-
porating source‐sink terms, are given by (adapted from the
work of Lynch [1986])

volume V = (Dx × Dy × Dz), represents the volume of water
added per unit time, divided by the nominal volume of the
cell. Note that no source terms are included in the depth‐
integrated form of the continuity equation (equation (1)).
This approximation is valid in simulating the effects of
bubble plumes, since all water entrained into the rising
plume reappears in the detrainment cell at the top of the
plume. Hence, water is only relocated within the water
column, and no sources or sinks exist when considering the
entire water column.
[13] The steady state bubble plume model estimates the
DMPR, the flow rate of ambient water entrained as the
plume rises, and the flow rate of water that is detrained upon
reaching the DMPR for a given ambient condition (in par-
ticular, temperature), which is predicted by the dynamic
reservoir model. The coupling is performed on a water
column by water column basis for each diffuser segment
(Figure 1). The hydrodynamic model provides profiles of
temperature and DO that are used as boundary conditions by
the bubble plume model. The bubble plume model then
predicts the detrainment flow rate Qd and the cell into which
water is discharged. This cell is referred to as the detrain-
ment cell (DC) and is unique in each column. For simplicity,
plume spreading is not considered and the plume width is
assumed to occupy a single column. The planar dimensions
of each column in the grid for SHR are 15 m × 15 m, and the
predicted plume width in SHR was less than 15 m except for
the top 1–2 m of the plume. For the DC, the source strength
terms are positive and defined as Qd/V, where V is the
nominal cell volume. All cells below the DC within a col-
umn are considered entrainment cells (ECs). The flow rates
being entrained into the plume at the ECs are calculated by
the plume model, and in general vary with vertical position,
Qe(z). The coupled model assumes that detrainment occurs
only at the detrainment cell. The temperature of the water
added to the DC is the flow‐weighted average of the tem-
peratures in the ECs in the column below. The DO con-
centration of the water detrained to the DC is the sum of
(1) the flow‐weighted average of the DO concentrations of
the ECs and (2) the oxygen mass addition rate through the
diffusers divided by Qd. This method ensures that mass and
heat are conserved during diffuser operation. Additionally,
the oxygen transfer efficiency of the linear diffuser was
assumed to be 100 percent (this assumption is valid for the
full‐scale test cases that were analyzed in this work). We
will initially assume that the entrained or detrained water has
a velocity equal to Uf /2, where Uf is the entrainment/
detrainment flow rate divided by the area of the flux faces
(indicated by arrows in Figure 1). The values of Uf for each
entrainment and detrainment cell are calculated by the
plume model and account for the effect of gas flow rate on
plume rise velocity and, subsequently, entrainment velocity.
We will discuss the effects of other choices for u0 and v0 in
the sensitivity analysis.
[14] Information is exchanged between the linear bubble
plume model and the reservoir model, and the linear bubble
plume model is executed at time intervals of Dtc which is
not necessarily equal to the hydrodynamic time step Dt. The
latter is typically on the order of O(10)s for computational
grids with cells of horizontal dimensions of O(10) m. The
former is dependent on the estimated time that ambient
conditions in the near field of the plume (i.e., boundary
conditions) will change significantly. That time scale Tc can
be estimated as the time it takes to replace the volume of
water existing in an entrainment cell V at any given time,
if the flow rate is equal to the entrainment flow rate Qe, i.e.,
Tc = V/Qe. For typical values of V ≈O(102) m3, which cor-
responds to cell dimensions of Dx = Dy = O(10) m and Dz =
O(1) m; and Qe ≈O(10−1–100) m3 s−1, Tc = O(102–103) s.
[15] The use of a quasi steady state model to represent the
plume dynamics in a reservoir hydrodynamic and transport
model is justified in that the characteristic time scale of the
evolution of plume properties Tplu is short compared with
the time scale of evolution of the basin‐scale fields Tbas, i.e.,
Tplu  Tbas. The scale Tplu can be estimated as H/vb where
H is the DMPR and vb is the bubble rise velocity. The scale
Tbas, in turn, can be estimated as the length of time a per-
turbation in the temperature field (as induced by the plume)
propagates to the ends of the basin. If we assume that the
diffuser operates at the center of the basin, then Tbas =
0.5 Llake/vigw, where vigw is the velocity of propagation of
internal gravity waves. For an average bubble rise velocity of
vb = 0.23 m s−1 [Wüest et al., 1992], vigw = 0.2 m s−1 [Imboden
and Wüest, 1995], H = O(10) m, and Llake = O(102–103) m
(typical of lake environments), Tbas = O(103–104) s, and
Tplu = O(102) s, 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller.
2.5. Data Collection
[16] To evaluate the performance of the coupled bubble
plume–reservoir model, experimental data were collected in
Spring Hollow Reservoir, where a linear diffuser is in opera-
tion (Figure 2). Constructed in 1995, SHR is a small mono-
mictic, mesotrophic side‐stream reservoir that is generally
stratified from May to December. The reservoir is managed
by the Western Virginia Water Authority and serves as one
of the drinking water sources for Roanoke County. The
water body has a maximum depth of 65 m and a maximum
surface elevation of 431 m. The approximate surface area
and volume at full pool are 0.54 km2 and 12.4 × 106 m3,
respectively. The reservoir is supplied with water pumped

from the Roanoke River. The pumped inflow enters the
reservoir through a vertical standpipe that discharges at
396 m elevation about 700 m upstream of the dam. To
prevent anoxia in the hypolimnion and the associated dete-
rioration of water quality, a linear diffuser equipped with
fine‐bubble porous hoses was installed in 1997 (Figure 2).
The diffuser can be supplied with compressed air or pure
oxygen at various gas flow rates and is located in the deepest
portion of the reservoir (368–372 m elevation). The diffuser is
designed to release a uniform gas flow rate along its length.
[17] A series of diffuser tests was performed in 1998 and
2003 [McGinnis et al., 2001; Singleton et al., 2007]. Com-
pressed air (21% O2) at a high gas flow rate (45 Nm3 h−1
average) was supplied to the diffuser from 28 September to
13 October in 1998. Pure oxygen (97% O2) was, in turn,
supplied at a low flow rate (23 Nm3 h−1 average) from 14
to 26 August 2003. Table 3 provides the diffuser operating
parameters during the 1998 and 2003 tests. The starting
water surface elevations during the 1998 and 2003 diffuser
tests were 420.1 and 430.1 m, respectively.
[18] Data collected during the two diffuser tests were used
to evaluate the coupled model (Table 3). During the 1998
test, no water was pumped from the river into the reservoir
during diffuser operation, thereby simplifying reservoir
hydrodynamics. The primary hydraulic forcing in the hypo-
limnion during testing was the linear bubble plume. Because
of equipment limitations, temperature and DO profiles were
obtained from only a single location adjacent to the dam,
approximately 155 m downstream of the end of the diffuser
(Figure 2). Profiles were measured immediately before the
diffuser was started on 28 September and on four additional
days during diffuser operation.
[19] To establish appropriate boundary conditions for the
bubble plume model, characterization of the plume near‐field
environment is necessary [McGinnis et al., 2004]. Therefore,
the data collected in 2003 included numerous high spatial
resolution CTD (Sea‐Bird Model SBE 19plus; 4 Hz sam-
pling rate) transects measured almost daily before, during,
and after diffuser operation. The CTD profiler was also
equipped with a DO probe (1.4 s response time measured at
20°C). Profiles were obtained laterally across the midpoint
of the diffuser (at the diffuser line location) and at several
locations longitudinally along the thalweg of the reservoir
(Figure 2, at the front, diffuser, and back line locations).
2.6.
Model Setup
[20] The coupled bubble plume–reservoir model was
applied to simulate the mixing and transport processes
occurring in Spring Hollow Reservoir during the two oxy-
genation tests. The lake geometry was discretized using 15 ×
15 × 0.5 m grid cells, and the time step was set to 10 s for
stability purposes. With this grid resolution, the advective
terms in our model should be able to resolve transport fea-
tures of O(102) m, the scale of the eddies which would
contribute most to the horizontal mixing of the reservoir
[Knauer et al., 2000]. The horizontal eddy viscosity Ah and
diffusivity Dh in the model were set to 10−2 m2 s−1. Use of
these values for horizontal diffusivities are supported by
results from tracer release experiments by Peeters et al.
[1996] in the metalimnion of small stratified lakes, the
regression curve proposed by Lawrence et al. [1995] on the
basis of their own observations, and those of Okubo [1971]
and Murthy [1976]. The 95% confidence interval in the
regression of Lawrence et al. [1995] includes values for Dh
ranging from 4 × 10−3 m2 s−1 to 2 × 10−2 m2 s−1. Model runs
were conducted by varying Ah and Dh within this confidence
interval, and the results were not sensitive to differences in
Ah and Dh of this magnitude. With horizontal diffusivities
of the order O(10−2) m2 s−1, it is expected that diffusion
terms, representing nonresolved subgrid‐scale mixing pro-
cesses,
will have negligible effects on the horizontal
spreading of patches during the 10–20 day period that was
simulated for each diffuser test. For time scales of 10 days,
the horizontal spreading of any patches induced by the oxy-
genation system will be mainly driven by advection pro-
cesses. With Dh = O(10−2) m2 s−1 for a 10 day period, only
patches with a horizontal scale of (Dht)1/2 = O(102) m would
be homogenized.
[21] The diffuser was modeled as discrete segments at the
bottom of consecutive columns along the thalweg in the
reservoir model grid. This allowed the elevation of each
segment to vary along the reservoir bottom. The number of
plume entrainment cells per column varied depending on
diffuser depth and predicted plume rise height within the
column. Detrainment was assumed to occur from a single
cell at the DMPR.

[22] The initial boundary conditions for the bubble plume
model were equal to the initial conditions selected for the
hydrodynamic model, as detailed in the next paragraph.
Subsequent boundary conditions for the plume model were
as predicted by the reservoir model for the columns laterally
adjacent to the columns which contained the diffuser. As the
runs progressed, plume boundary conditions were updated
every 30 min.
[23] Initial
conditions
for
the
hydrodynamic
model
included temperature and DO profiles. The entire reservoir
was initialized to a single grid‐wide vertical profile for each
constituent. For 1998 and 2003, the initial reservoir condi-
tions were equal to the profiles measured immediately
before diffuser start‐up. Because profiles were collected at
numerous locations in 2003, the initial conditions for that
diffuser test were the profiles collected at the midpoint of the
diffuser (diffuser line location, Figure 2). (Note that the
diffuser was repositioned closer to the dam in 2002.) In
general, if vertical profiles from multiple locations are
available to initialize the reservoir model, it is recommended
that profiles closest to the plume near field (±1–2 m laterally
from diffuser centerline) be used [McGinnis et al., 2004]. If
multiple near‐field profiles have been collected prior to
diffuser start‐up, then profiles closest to the longitudinal
midpoint should be used for initial conditions.
[24] The hydrodynamic model was forced using (1) observed
flow rate and temperature data for the pumped raw water
inflow entering the reservoir (inflow boundary conditions),
(2) measured outflow rates to the water treatment plant
through a withdrawal gate located at 396 m elevation (out-
flow boundary conditions), (3) surface heat and momentum
fluxes (surface boundary conditions) estimated from mete-
orological records collected either at the local airport (for
1998) or by a weather station installed on the lake (for
2003), and (4) operational data from the linear bubble plume
diffusers (Table 3). Other inflows and outflows, such as
precipitation, evaporation, and seepage, were not included in
the model given that their contribution to the water balance
during the short time periods of the simulations was minimal
compared to pumped inflows or outflows to the treatment
plant. Standard bulk aerodynamic formulae [see Rueda,
2001, and references therein] were used to calculate
surface heat and momentum fluxes from meteorological
records. The DO concentration of the pumped inflow was
estimated using the measured temperature of the flow and
assuming 100 percent saturation. The outflow to the treat-
ment plant was the largest measured flow rate from the
reservoir. The oxygen simulations included transport, sour-
ces and sinks above the diffuser line representing the
entrainment of ambient water at the base of the plumes and
the detrainment of oxygenated water at the top of the plume,
and a sink term in the bottom cells representing SOU. For
1998, the SOU was determined by applying a mass balance
on DO in the hypolimnion during the diffuser operating
period and assuming that the sediments were the only sink for
hypolimnetic DO depletion. For 2003, the SOU was esti-
mated using the correlation of Gantzer et al. [2009], which
was developed using DO data collected from SHR during
2003–2008 and is a function of gas flow rate. The correlation
actually calculates the hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD),
or oxygen demand in both the water column and sediments,
induced by diffuser operation. However, because data on
SOU are not available for SHR, we assume that HOD is
equivalent to SOU in this work. The SOU rates used in the
simulations are summarized in Table 3.

reservoir–bubble plume model to determine the effects of
select model parameters and model configuration modes

hypolimnion. We adopted the first‐order variance analysis
(FOVA), as outlined by Blumberg and Georgas [2008], and
the associated dimensionless sensitivity coefficients to
quantify model sensitivity. The dimensionless sensitivity
coefficient Sp of any model output variable F (for example,
DO concentration) to perturbations in any given parameter or
forcing variable p can be determined numerically by the
FOVA as
Sp p0
ð
Þ ¼ DF=F p ¼ p0
ð
Þ
Dp=p0
ð7Þ
where DF is the change in the output variable that results
from a sufficiently small (<10%) change or perturbation in the
parameter Dp, from a reference or baseline value p0. The
sensitivity coefficient can be interpreted as the percentage
change in the output variable F resulting from a 1% uncer-
tainty in the model parameter p. This approach can be
repeated one at a time for any given set of parameters, pro-
viding a relatively simple and straightforward alternative to
other techniques that have been proposed in the literature for
assessing the sensitivity of hydrodynamic models [Piasecki
and Katopodes, 1999; Salas and Shin, 1999; Sanders and
Katopodes, 2000]. To calculate each dimensionless sensi-
tivity coefficient, DF/F was evaluated as the L1 norm
[Trefethen and Bau, 1997] of the difference between the
output variable evaluated at the perturbed F(p0 + Dp) and
nonperturbed F(p0) values of the parameter p. The L1 norm
was also used to evaluate the magnitude of Dp/p0 in cases
where the input variable varied spatially. Once Sp is calcu-
lated for a range of parameters, a normalized measure of the
output uncertainty ∣S∣can be estimated as

where n is the number of parameters being considered in the

Results and Discussion
3.1.
Effect of Coupling on Temperature
and Dissolved Oxygen
[26] To demonstrate that coupling of the bubble plume
model with the hydrodynamic model does indeed improve
the prediction of temperature and dissolved oxygen, the
coupled model was run with the diffuser turned off (i.e., the
hydrodynamic model alone). The predicted hypolimnetic
profiles did not vary much from the initial conditions during
the course of the 11 day diffuser test (Figure 3). By contrast,
coupling of the bubble plume and hydrodynamic models
resulted in greatly improved predicted profiles in the hypo-
limnion (Figure 4). The decreasing temperature gradient at
the top of the hypolimnion predicted by the hydrodynamic
model alone (Figure 3b) is likely due to wind mixing at the
surface, evidenced by cooling and deepening of the epilim-
nion observed during the diffuser test (not shown).
3.2.
Coupled Model Validation
[27] The coupled model was used to predict the evolution
of temperature and DO within the hypolimnion for September
1998 (Figure 4). Diffuser operation resulted in more homo-
geneous vertical temperatures and increased the bulk hypo-
limnion temperature, due to entrainment of metalimnetic
water. The vertical distribution of oxygen is almost uniform
throughout the hypolimnion; the large DO concentrations in
the core of the hypolimnion due to diffuser operation rapidly

decrease toward the metalimnion and toward the sediments.
The former boundary layer is the result of limited vertical
mass exchange at the thermocline. The bottom boundary
layer is caused by the sediments removing oxygen from the
near‐sediment water at a faster rate than it can be replenished
by vertical mixing or lateral circulation.
[28] Overall, the coupled model predicts the bulk DO
and temperature profiles quite well for September 1998
(Figure 4). Bulk hypolimnion temperatures were also well
simulated (Figure 4b). Underprediction of temperature at
48 h and 96 h after start‐up could have been caused by
underestimated horizontal mixing. Predicted bottom tem-
peratures and DO concentrations are greater than observed,
which suggests that the model slightly overestimates vertical
mixing rates. Possible reasons for this include inaccuracies in
the bathymetry representation, horizontal dispersion coeffi-
cient, or induced plume water flow rate.
[29] The coupled bubble plume–hydrodynamic model
was also used to predict the hypolimnetic DO and temper-
ature at the three longitudinal locations along the reservoir
thalweg for August 2003 (Figure 5). The coupled model
accurately predicted the bulk DO increase at each location
over the course of the diffuser test. However, the modest
hypolimnetic warming caused by diffuser operation was
slightly overestimated for the location downstream of the
diffuser (Figure 5f). This suggests that diffuser‐induced
vertical mixing, and subsequent erosion of the thermocline,
is overpredicted longitudinally away from the diffuser,
similar to the results for the 1998 diffuser test. Additional
evidence of overestimated mixing are the overly strong
temperature and DO gradients predicted at the top of the
hypolimnion for the downstream location. Even though
vertical mixing is overestimated downstream of the diffuser,
the coupled model quite accurately predicted hypolimnetic
warming above the midpoint of the diffuser (Figure 5d).
[30] Some of the discrepancies between observed and
predicted profiles at the thalweg locations downstream
(Figures 5e and 5f) and upstream (Figures 5a and 5b) of the
linear diffuser in August 2003 are due to inaccurate initial
boundary conditions. Spatially varying initial conditions,
though, are difficult to determine from the available field
data. Consequently, uniform conditions are commonly pre-
sumed in three‐dimensional lake modeling [e.g., Hodges
et al., 2000; Rueda et al., 2003b]. For the 2003 simu-
lations, the reservoir initial conditions were assumed to
be equal to the measured temperature and DO profiles at
the midpoint of the diffuser (Figures 5c and 5d, start).
Even though the initial DO gradient specified above the
sediments is much weaker than observed for the location
furthest upstream of the dam (Figure 5a), the final pre-
dicted DO gradient in the bottom boundary layer is
stronger and resembles the shape of the measured profile.
A single value for SOU was determined for each diffuser test,
and the SOU for 2003 was calculated using a correlation
which is a function of diffuser gas flow rate [Gantzer et al.,
2009]. Gantzer et al. [2009] developed the correlation after
discovering that SOU increased proportional to gas flow rate
in SHR, which was due to increased turbulence and mixing
caused by diffuser operation. However, the correlation may
overestimate the local SOU at a longitudinal location away
from the diffuser, where the sediments are less impacted by
diffuser‐induced mixing.
3.3. Effects of Bubble Plume on Lake Circulation
and Dissolved Oxygen Field
[31] Bubble plume circulation and mixing were examined
using simulation results in which the only forcing was due
to diffuser operation (i.e., no inflows or outflows, SOU, or
atmospheric forcing). The initial temperature and gas flow
rate and composition were equal to the 1998 diffuser test.

operation in September 1998.

The lake was assumed to have zero initial oxygen concen-
tration to track the fate and transport of oxygen added by the
diffuser. The duration of the simulation was set to 1 day.
[32] Figure 6a shows that two nonsymmetric circulation
cells developed laterally on either side of the diffuser: water
flows away from the diffuser at the top of the plume
(detrainment), but it flows toward the plume below the top
(entrainment). Simulations conducted in a rectangular basin
with the diffuser located in the center yielded circulation
cells which are symmetric laterally on both sides of the
diffuser. This suggests that the asymmetric circulation in
SHR is due to the irregular bathymetry.
[33] The predicted vertical velocity of the water directly
over the diffuser is negative (Figure 6a), which appears to be
inconsistent with the sign of the basin‐scale lateral recir-
culation cells that develop on both sides of the diffusers. In
the coupled model, the motion of water within the plume is
simulated as a relocation of water parcels occurring instan-
taneously. The model, in turn, captures the response of the
near field (the water column above the diffuser and the
water columns adjacent to this column) to that rapid relo-
cation process. This response consists of replacing part of
the plume‐relocated water with water from cells above and
with water entrained from the ambient. These results are
consistent with the velocity observations collected in Lake
Figure 5.

Hallwil, Switzerland by McGinnis et al. [2004], which
indeed reveal downward flowing water near the diffuser due
to plume near‐field recirculation. Water relocated from near
the bottom will consist of ambient far‐field water flowing
(from neighboring water columns in the model) toward the
diffuser as well as downward flowing water from the near
field (i.e., from the same water column affected by the
relocation process in the coupled model).
[34] The plume not only induces hypolimnetic currents,
but it also causes the water above the hypolimnion to move
(Figure 6). The horizontal velocity above the hypoliminion
oscillates in the vertical direction. The oscillatory nature (in
space) of the velocity field is likely related to the occurrence
of diffuser‐induced internal oscillations in the lake thermal
structure. These oscillations are revealed by the isotherms
being displaced from their horizontal equilibrium position
(Figures 6a and 6b), and appear to be of small amplitude and
large wave number. The development of such internal
oscillations characterizes the transitory response of a strati-
fied water body to external perturbations [Fischer et al.,
1979]. They occur, for example, after the initiation of with-
drawal operations in stratified bodies [Imberger et al., 1976;
Imberger, 1980; Silvester, 1980]. These internal oscillations
are weak and, due to their high wave number, should rapidly
dissipate [Münnich, 1996]. Hence, the oscillations might not
be observable in the field, where they could be masked by
currents or wind‐induced internal waves, which are larger in
magnitude and appear to dominate the observations in field
data sets collected in other reservoirs [Vidal et al., 2005,
2007].
[35] The distribution of DO added by a hypolimnetic
oxygenation system is of great interest to reservoir managers
and design engineers. The coupled model predicts a region
of highest DO directly above the linear diffuser (Figure 6b).
Away from the diffuser and along the lake thalweg, the
relative change in DO is less. (The presence of DO laterally
(Figure 6a) and longitudinally (Figure 6b) away from the
diffuser is due to spreading of added DO by plume‐induced
mixing in the hypolimnion.) Downstream of the diffuser and
toward the dam, the hypolimnion appears to be more oxy-
genated than upstream. The topography and slope of the
reservoir bottom may have contributed to this effect. The rise
height of the plume (i.e., vertical distance from the diffuser to
the top of the hypolimnion) is greater at the downstream end
of the diffuser compared to the upstream end because of the
deeper diffuser depth (Figure 6b). The greater plume rise

and the solid triangle defines the position along the thalweg for the cross section in Figure 6a.

height results in more entrainment and detrainment and,
subsequently, enhanced circulation and mixing, which con-
tributes to greater distribution of DO downstream of the
diffuser compared to upstream.
[36] Upstream and downstream of the ends of the linear
diffuser, the maximum DO concentrations appear not at the
top of the hypolimnion but at middepth (Figure 6b). The
predicted longitudinal circulation away from the diffuser
appears to be focused not at the top of the hypolimnion, but
below it. This motion could be mainly driven by operation
of the diffuser, but the baroclinic pressure gradients created
by the diffuser in the hypolimnion also play a role. The
diffuser rapidly mixes the hypolimnetic water lying above it
and generates temperature gradients along the reservoir
thalweg (Figure 6b). The velocity scale U of density driven
currents can be estimated as [Rueda et al., 2003a]

where b is the thermal expansion coefficient (≈1.4 ×

ences, and H is a length scale representing the depth of the
water column. For D ≈O(10−1 °C) and H ≈O(10) m as
observed in SHR (Figure 6b), U is O(10−2) m s−1, as predicted
by the model (Figure 6b).
3.4. Sensitivity Analysis
[37] The parameters selected for the sensitivity analysis
are either difficult to measure (SOU and entrainment and
detrainment velocity), can be controlled through system
design or operation (diffuser length Ldiff, gas flow rate Qg,
and initial bubble radius rini) or relate to the accuracy with
which the reservoir bathymetry is known. Sediment oxygen
uptake, for example, is generally modeled using a reservoir‐
wide constant coefficient (ksou), the value of which is subject
to a large degree of uncertainty. The SOU range for lakes is
typically 0.06–2 g m−2 d−1, as reported by Chapra [1997].
Similarly, Cole and Wells [2006] stated that SOU generally
ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 g m−2 d−1, but can be higher. Here,
the SOU was varied between ±10% of the baseline value
used in the simulations of the 1998 experiment, in accor-
dance with the conditions required by the FOVA.
[38] For the sensitivity analysis, the velocity of the
entrainment or detrainment flow was assumed initially to be
equal to the velocity of the ambient flow, or Uamb. Other
values are also plausible (refer to section 2.4), but we do not
have any a priori arguments that justify one value. One
simulation
was
conducted
with
the
entrainment
and
detrainment velocities set equal to the velocities through the
cell flux faces (Uf), to determine the effects of momentum
on predicted temperature and DO fields.
[39] Other parameters included in the sensitivity analysis
(diffuser dimensions, gas flow rate, and, to a lesser extent,
initial bubble size) can be controlled through diffuser design
and operation. The sensitivity range for Ldiff corresponds to
about ±8% of the baseline value used in the simulations of
the 1998 experiment, which is equal to the length of two
columns in the grid. Similar to SOU, the ranges for Ldiff and
initial bubble radius are ±10% of the baseline value.
[40] Reservoir bathymetry can also be associated with a
large degree of uncertainty. During the process of convert-
ing topographic data to a bathymetry input file for a
hydrodynamic model, the effective volume‐depth curve, and
consequently the transport and mixing processes that occur
within that domain, can be altered. Uncertainty in model
bathymetry not only results in changes to the volume of
water receiving oxygen, but might also affect the depth of
the diffuser, modifying the diffuser operating conditions. In
this work, we focus on bathymetry effects that change the
lake volume but not the diffuser depth. The bathymetry in
the sensitivity simulations was modified either by increasing
the depth of the deeper columns (those with depths greater
than 35 m) in the hypolimnion by 1.5 m and making
the shallower columns even shallower, or, by decreasing the
depth of the deeper columns by 1.5 m and deepening the
shallower columns. The changes introduced in the depths of
the shallower columns of the hypolimnion were made so
that hypolimnetic volume was conserved. The depth‐volume
curves were, in turn, modified. Modifying the depths of the
water columns in the hypolimnion resulted in about 10% of
the total volume of the hypolimnion being shifted to different
depths for each perturbation condition.
[41] Of all the parameters analyzed, the largest source of
uncertainty for both the DO and temperature predictions is
the model bathymetry, which accounts for about 90% of the
total uncertainty (Table 4). This is consistent with the results
of Blumberg and Georgas [2008], who found that the sen-
sitivity coefficients for bathymetry were usually much
higher than the coefficients for wind forcing or tidal
amplitude in a three‐dimensional estuarine model. Modify-
ing the grid resolution would likely affect the magnitude of
the uncertainty associated with the bathymetry, but the
bathymetry would probably still be the greatest contributor
to the total model uncertainty. These results suggest that
special care should be taken to acquire accurate bathymetric
data, and to generate model grids that represent the water
body’s area distribution with depth as closely as possible.
[42] The parameter with the lowest sensitivity coefficient
for DO is the initial bubble size (Table 4). Oxygen transfer
efficiency is a strong function of initial bubble size for radii
greater than about 10−3 m [Singleton et al., 2007]. However,
we assumed 100% oxygen transfer efficiency for all of the
simulations in this work, which is why the coupled model is
insensitive to initial bubble size. Of the remaining three
parameters, the gas flow rate has the second largest sensi-
tivity coefficient for both predicted temperature and DO
(Table 4). By increasing the gas flow rate, water managers
increase the rate of oxygen addition in the hypolimnion, but
they will also increase the rate at which warmer and
potentially lower‐oxygen water above the thermocline (due
to metalimnetic DO minima [Effler et al., 1998; Schram and
Marzolf, 1994; Shapiro, 1960]) is entrained into the hypo-
limnion (as evidenced in Table 4 by the relatively large
sensitivity of temperature to gas flow rate). Higher hypo-
limnetic temperatures and increased water velocity above
the sediments may lead to increased SOU, which would
partially negate the oxygenation effects of increasing the
diffuser gas flow rate.
[43] Our analysis indicates that determining accurate va-
lues of SOU is not critical to obtaining good DO model
predictions. However, given that rates of areal hypolimnetic
oxygen demand (which are commonly assumed to approx-
imate SOU rates) reported in the literature can vary by up to
2 orders of magnitude [Chapra, 1997], the relative scale of
the value should be well defined. The insensitivity of pre-

dicted DO concentrations to changes in SOU is likely
because the rate of oxygen addition from the bubble plume
was four times the SOU rate. Note also that by changing the
SOU, the temperature structure of the reservoir is altered to
a small degree (Table 4). This suggests that oxygen levels
could influence mixing dynamics in the lake. This appar-
ently unrelated consequence can be explained by consider-
ing the rate at which rising bubbles dissolve, and hence, the
rate at which buoyancy changes vertically along the plume
rise height. Dissolution of the bubbles, which contain gas-
eous oxygen, is a function of the DO concentration differ-
ence between the interior of the bubble and the ambient
water. Changes in the SOU can affect the ambient DO
concentration, thereby affecting bubble dissolution, the
plume rise height, and, subsequently, hypolimnetic mixing
and erosion of the thermocline.
3.5.
Momentum of Plume Entrainment and
Detrainment
[44] There are three primary sources of uncertainty in
hydrodynamic and transport modeling studies: (1) the
structure of the model, (2) the use of parameters with unknown
value (knowledge uncertainty), and (3) the intrinsic stochastic
nature of hydrological and/or meteorological phenomena
forcing the transport in aquatic systems (stochastic uncer-
tainty) [Hession et al., 1996; Melching, 1995; van Straten and
Keesman, 1991]. A large source of uncertainty in the structure
of the coupled model is the momentum or velocity assigned
to plume entrainment and detrainment. At the center of
the plume, the horizontal velocity components u0 and v0 of
the water that has been entrained or detrained are equal to
the ambient velocity Uamb. At the perimeter of the water
column in which the plume is located, the horizontal
velocity of the water being entrained or detrained is equal to
the entrainment or detrainment flow rate divided by the area
of the flux faces (Uf) (Figure 1). These two velocity values,
and any other within their range, are plausible values for u0
and v0. We will refer to the option of setting (u0, v0) = Uamb
as mode or configuration 1, or C1; and (u0, v0) = Uf as mode
or configuration 2, or C2. Note that in the model validation
simulations discussed previously, (u0, v0) was set to Uf /2.
[45] Simulations of the 1998 experiments conducted with
configurations C1 and C2 yielded different temperature and
DO profiles near the dam at the end of the 11 day diffuser
test (Figure 7). The root‐mean‐square difference (RMSD) of
the temperature and DO profiles at the end of the 11 day
period simulated with modes C1 and C2 was 0.78°C and
0.47 g m−3, respectively (Table 4). These RMSDs are similar
in magnitude to and greater than the RMSDs encountered
when varying the bottom bathymetry, to which the model
exhibits the largest sensitivity (as discussed previously). The
choice of appropriate values of u0 and v0 is clearly crucial.
[46] The bulk DO concentration in the hypolimnion is less
for C2 compared to C1 as a consequence of larger vertical
entrainment rates of the more oxygen depleted water of the
metalimnion into the hypolimnion (Figure 7a). Predicted
hypolimnion temperature was also larger for C2 (Figure 7b)
as a result of larger vertical entrainment rates of warmer
metalimnetic water in the hypolimnion. The elevation of the
top of the hypolimnion at the end of the simulations was
higher for C2 compared with C1, which is indicative of a
larger portion of the lake volume being part of the hypo-
limnetic volume. The larger hypolimnetic volume for C2
could have contributed to the lower predicted bulk DO in
this configuration, compared with C1, by diluting the oxy-
gen mass addition of the plume.

Conclusions
[47] To model the complex interaction between a bubble
plume used for hypolimnetic oxygenation and the ambient
water body, a bubble plume model for a linear diffuser was
coupled with a three‐dimensional reservoir hydrodynamic
model. Overall, the coupled model predicted the bulk DO
and temperature profiles well for the two diffuser tests,
September 1998 (compressed air at 45 Nm3 h−1) and August
2003 (pure oxygen at 23 Nm3 h−1). The comparisons
between predictions and observations generally improved as
each diffuser test proceeded. The simulated model profiles
became more uniform vertically as the run progressed
compared to observations, which could have been caused by
overestimated vertical mixing and/or the inappropriate
selection of detrainment momentum for the coupled model.
The detrainment momentum, which was assumed to be

proportional to Uf /2 for the baseline runs, may have been
overestimated.
[48] Simulations to examine the effects of bubble plume
operation on mixing and reservoir circulation revealed the
development of two nonsymmetric circulation cells both
laterally across the diffuser and longitudinally upstream and
downstream of the diffuser: water flows away from the
diffuser at the top of the plume (detrainment) and flows
toward the plume below the top (entrainment). On the basis
of the results of similar simulations conducted in a rectan-
gular basin, it was concluded that the asymmetry of the
predicted circulation in SHR is due to an irregular reservoir
bathymetry. The plume rapidly mixes the hypolimnion
directly above it and causes the water above the linear dif-
fuser to be colder compared to away from the ends of the
diffuser, which results in intrusions flowing from above the
diffuser into the upstream and downstream water columns.
[49] Of all the parameters included in the sensitivity
analysis, the largest source of uncertainty for both predicted
DO and temperature is the model bathymetry, which
accounted for about 90% of the total uncertainty. Therefore,
special care should be taken when determining reservoir
bathymetry as well as constructing the model grid; the
hypsographic depth‐area curves used in the model should
match the actual bathymetry as closely as possible. One of
the greatest sources of uncertainty in the structure of the
coupled model is the momentum or velocity assigned to
plume entrainment and detrainment. The horizontal momen-
tum of the entrainment or detrainment can vary from the
ambient value to the value at the perimeter through the flux
faces. The horizontal plume‐induced momentum signifi-
cantly affects the predicted intensity of mixing and lake
circulation. Consequently, the time scales of transport (for
example, the time to reach uniform conditions in the
hypolimnion) are also affected. Additional research on the
plume detrainment momentum appropriate for the coupled
model needs to be conducted.
[50] Coupling of the plume model with the hydrodynamic
model is promising as an engineering tool for design and
evaluation of hypolimnetic oxygenation systems. As a
complement to this, the coupled models can be used to more
thoroughly investigate the effect of plume‐induced mixing
in a lake or reservoir.

Oxygenation systems, such as bubble-plume diffusers, are used to improve water quality
by replenishing dissolved oxygen (DO) in the hypolimnia of water-supply reservoirs. The
diffusers induce circulation and mixing, which helps distribute DO throughout the hypo-
limnion. Mixing, however, has also been observed to increase hypolimnetic oxygen
demand (HOD) during system operation, thus accelerating oxygen depletion. Two water-
supply reservoirs (Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR) and Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR)) that
employ linear bubble-plume diffusers were studied to quantify diffuser effects on HOD.
A recently validated plume model was used to predict oxygen addition rates. The results
were used together with observed oxygen accumulation rates to evaluate HOD over a wide
range of applied gas ﬂow rates. Plume-induced mixing correlated well with applied gas
ﬂow rate and was observed to increase HOD. Linear relationships between applied gas ﬂow
rate and HOD were found for both SHR and CCR. HOD was also observed to be independent
of bulk hypolimnion oxygen concentration, indicating that HOD is controlled by induced
mixing. Despite transient increases in HOD, oxygenation caused an overall decrease in
background HOD, as well as a decrease in induced HOD during diffuser operation, over
several years. This suggests that the residual or background oxygen demand decreases
from one year to the next. Despite diffuser-induced increases in HOD, hypolimnetic
oxygenation remains a viable method for replenishing DO in thermally-stratiﬁed water-
supply reservoirs such as SHR and CCR.

Introduction
Oxygen-consuming processes that occur naturally in lakes
and reservoirs include oxidation of reduced chemical species
(Zaw and Chiswell, 1999; Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006a), algal
and aquatic respiration (Nakamura and Stefan, 1994) and
aerobic decomposition of organic matter (Mackenthun and
Stefan, 1998; Moore, 2003; Higashino and Stefan, 2005;
Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006a). Lakes in temperate climates
undergo seasonal stratiﬁcation, creating a warmer, less-dense
epilimion, a transitionary thermocline or metalimnion, and
a colder, more-dense hypolimnion at the top, middle and
bottom, respectively (Wetzel, 1975). The density gradient
limits oxygen transfer from the surface to the lower hypo-
limnetic water (Mackenthun and Stefan, 1998). Depletion of
dissolved oxygen (DO) in the hypolimnion is exacerbated as
algae, which grow in the photic zone, complete their life cycle
and are degraded as they settle through the water column.
This settling organic detritus undergoes aerobic decomposi-
tion in the presence of DO, which contributes to water column

oxygen demand (WOD). Incompletely oxidized detritus settles
through the hypolimnion and accumulates on the bottom,
becoming incorporated into the sediment and contributing to
sediment oxygen demand (SOD) (Higashino and Stefan, 2005;
Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006b; Beutel et al., 2007). The net effect
of both WOD and SOD in the hypolimnion is an overall
hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD) (Nakamura and Stefan,
1994; Moore et al., 1996; Beutel et al., 2007). HOD can cause
anoxic conditions by completely depleting oxygen in the
hypolimnion if the HOD exceeds the amount of DO available
in the hypolimnion at the beginning of the stratiﬁed period
(Burris et al., 2002; Moore, 2003; Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006a;
Singleton and Little, 2006; Beutel et al., 2007). Anoxic condi-
tions result in a shift in redox potential as decomposition of
organic detritus continues, using other terminal electron
acceptors with lower available energy than oxygen (Madigan
et al., 2003). This results in the reduction of oxidized
compounds (e.g., Manganese (Mn) oxides) and subsequent
release of soluble, reduced species (e.g., Mn2þ) from the sedi-
ment to the hypolimnetic water. Longer periods of anoxia
result in more signiﬁcant deterioration of water quality as
reduced species continue to diffuse out of the sediment and
enter the hypolimnion (McGinnis and Little, 2002; Matthews
and Efﬂer, 2006a).
Several methods are employed to increase hypolimnion
oxygen concentrations (Beutel and Horne, 1999; Singleton and
Little, 2006). In this study, for simplicity, aeration will refer to
systems using compressed air and oxygenation to those using
pure oxygen, whether it is supplied from stored bulk liquid or
generated on-site. Although these systems are designed to
replenish oxygen in the hypolimnion, higher rates of oxygen
depletion during periods of aeration or oxygenation are
frequently observed. For example, aeration studies have
shown that HOD was: (1) 10 times higher in an aerated
hypolimnion compared to a non-aerated hypolimnion (Ash-
ley, 1981); (2) approximately double pre-aeration demand in
Medical Lake, Washington (Soltero et al., 1994); and (3)
observed to increase three to four times during aeration
(Lorenzen and Fast, 1977; Moore et al., 1996). Increased oxygen
consumption
resulting
from
hypolimnetic
aeration
or
oxygenation has been designated ‘‘induced oxygen demand’’
(Beutel, 2003) and is hypothesized to result from both (1)
increased SOD (Moore, 2003; Beutel et al., 2007) and (2)
increased WOD (Ashley, 1983).
Factors affecting SOD have been extensively studied in
laboratory-incubated sediment samples (Moore et al., 1996;
Mackenthun and Stefan, 1998; Moore, 2003; Beutel et al., 2007)
and
using
in-situ
SOD
chambers
(Davis
et
al.,
1987).
Researchers have investigated the effect of surﬁcial versus
deep sediments (Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006b), a multi-layered
diffusive boundary layer (DBL) above the sediment–water
interface (SWI) (Mackenthun and Stefan, 1998), variations
between laminar and turbulent boundaries at the SWI
(Mackenthun and Stefan, 1998; Moore, 2003) and have shown
that changes in SOD are directly related to water velocities
over the sediment (Jorgensen and Revsbech, 1985; Mack-
enthun and Stefan, 1998; Moore, 2003; Beutel et al., 2007).
Although useful for gaining theoretical understanding, small-
scale laboratory measurements are not representative of
actual reservoir or lake conditions, nor do SOD chambers
emulate hydrodynamic conditions at the SWI. Furthermore,
oxygenation systems do not necessarily affect the entire
sediment surface area (Moore et al., 1996), which emphasizes
the importance of analyzing these systems on a basin-wide
scale. In addition to questions regarding induced HOD, there
are also arguments on whether, after several years of aera-
tion or oxygenation, HOD may in fact decrease as the systems
more completely satisfy oxygen demand (both WOD and
SOD) (McQueen and Lean, 1984; Matinvesi, 1996; Moore et al.,
1996; Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006b) thus reducing the ‘‘carry-
over’’ of latent demand from one year to the next. No
comprehensive studies of induced HOD and the potential
long-term decrease in HOD have been published to date. In
this research, a detailed analysis of two full-scale linear
bubble-plume oxygenation systems, located in two different
water-supply reservoirs and operated over a wide range of
applied gas ﬂow rates, is performed. Our objectives are to
investigate: (1) induced HOD as a function of gas ﬂow rate
showing the effect of (a) plume-induced mixing and (b)
oxygen concentration in the bulk hypolimnetic water; and (2)
the long-term reduction of both background and diffuser-
induced HOD.

Materials and methods
2.1.
Study sites
Spring Hollow Reservoir (SHR) (Fig. 1) and Carvins Cove
Reservoir (CCR) (Fig. 2) are water-supply reservoirs for the City
of Roanoke and surrounding counties, located on private,
heavily-forested watersheds in southwestern Virginia, USA.
SHR is a pump-storage, side-stream reservoir, supplied with
water drawn from the Roanoke River. CCR is supplied by two
natural tributaries that ﬂow from agriculturally-dominated
lands and two creeks from an adjoining watershed that are
routed
through
diversion
tunnels.
Linear
bubble-plume
diffusers, using pure oxygen generated by vaporizing stored
liquid, have been installed in both reservoirs. The goal of
oxygenation is to improve raw water quality during summer
stratiﬁcation by: (1) increasing and maintaining oxygen levels
throughout the hypolimnion as well as in the upper layers of
the sediment; (2) minimizing transport of soluble chemical
species from the sediment to the bulk water and subsequently
reducing chemical demand during the treatment process; and
(3) controlling long-term eutrophication by reducing internal
phosphorous loading. Oxygenation in both reservoirs has
maintained bulk hypolimion oxygen levels in excess of 7 mg
l1, measurable oxygen in the upper layers of the sediment
(Bryant et al., in preparation), and reduced levels of soluble
Fe2þ and Mn2þ in the bulk water (Gantzer et al., this work).
SHR and CCR are quite different in terms of reservoir
characteristics allowing oxygenation to be studied under
dissimilar conditions. The characteristics of both reservoirs
and their respective oxygenation systems are summarized in
Table 1. While the morphology and depth of SHR tend to shield
the hypolimnion from turbulence caused by wind-induced
mixing, CCR is shallower and more susceptible to wind-driven
effects.

Data collection
A Seabird Electronics SBE 19plus (4 Hz sampling rate) high-
resolution proﬁler (CTD) was used to collect conductivity,
temperature and dissolved oxygen proﬁles in both reservoirs.
The oxygen probe on the CTD has a response time of 1.4 s at
20 C, allowing data to be collected at 0.1-m increments. A
HydrolabDataSonde4amultiprobewasusedinconjunctionwith
the CTD to obtain proﬁles at a lower vertical resolution of 0.5 m.
Data collection began in early spring once weather condi-
tions
allowed
the
reservoirs
to
become
accessible
and
continued through destratiﬁcation. SHR and CCR begin to
stratify in April, although the thermal structure typically does
not fully stabilize until May. CCR destratiﬁes in early November
while SHR, being deeper, often remains stratiﬁed through
January. Water column proﬁles were collected during stratiﬁed
periods on an average of 36 days per year in CCR (from 2004 to
2007) and 38 days per year in SHR (from 2003 to 2008), yielding
a total of over 4800 individual proﬁles. Proﬁles were collected
weekly during stratiﬁcation before diffuser operation and at an
increased frequency during periods of diffuser operation.

respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). These locations span the entire
hypolimnion and include locations upstream, downstream,
and in the immediate vicinity of the diffusers. Lateral transects
of water column proﬁles were also collected covering 60 and 80
locations across the diffuser lines in SHR and CCR, respec-
tively, to more accurately characterize the bubble plumes
produced by the oxygenation systems (Singleton et al., 2007).
2.3.
Data analysis
The water column proﬁling strategy focused on capturing
oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion before, during and after
periods of oxygenation. Calculations based on CTD proﬁle
data were performed to determine HOD. This was done by ﬁrst
analyzing temperature proﬁles to determine the boundary
between the metalimnion and hypolimnion, and the corre-
sponding hypolimnetic volume. The reservoir was then
divided into several sections (based on longitudinal sample
locations) and vertical layers (based on sampling depth loca-
tions) to determine the oxygen mass associated with the
measured oxygen concentrations. Total oxygen mass as well
as volume-averaged oxygen concentrations were determined
as a function of time. Oxygen mass, average oxygen concen-
tration and hypolimnetic volume during each time period
were then used to determine HOD as a function of oxygen
mass (HODmass) and oxygen concentration (HODconc). This
procedure was also used to establish background HOD when
the diffuser was not in operation.
During operation, oxygen is added to the water column via
a bubble plume. To quantify the effect of the diffuser system
on HOD, a previously validated plume model (Singleton et al.,
2007) was used to estimate the amount of oxygen added to the
hypolimnion. The diffuser-induced HOD was then calculated
by determining the difference between the amount of oxygen
added (predicted data) and the amount observed in the water
column (measured data). Water column temperature proﬁles
were used to determine the rate of hypolimnetic warming,
which
is
indicative
of
mixing
associated
with
diffuser
operation.
2.3.1.
Determining thermocline location
Following Wetzel (1975), the boundary of the hypolimnion was
determined as the point of intersection between lines drawn
through the thermocline and bulk hypolimnion temperature
proﬁles. Our approach follows similar work done by Quinlan
et al. (2005) which uses the inﬂection method and includes the
lower portion of the metalimnion in the hypolimnion. Energy
exchange between the hypolimnion and metalimnion results
in downward movement of the thermocline throughout the
year (Eckert et al., 2002). The resulting warming of the hypo-
limnion corresponds with oxygen transfer between these
layers (Davis et al., 1987; Eckert et al., 2002) and thus affects
the amount of oxygen in the hypolimnion. Deﬁning the
hypolimnetic volume as a function of thermocline position
and hypolimnion temperature provides a consistent basis for
evaluating the effects of diffuser-induced mixing.
2.3.2.
Oxygen content
Dissolved oxygen proﬁles of the water column were obtained
at six and seven locations along SHR and CCR, respectively.
Each reservoir was divided into sections based on the proﬁle
locations. CTD proﬁles collected at increments of 0.1–0.2 m
were converted to a uniform 0.1-m grid using linear interpo-
lation between consecutive data points. Each section was
divided into 0.1-m layers. This created a section (x)–layer (z)
grid that divided the reservoir into cells. The volume-weighted
total mass of oxygen in the hypolimnion was calculated by
multiplying the oxygen concentration (DOx,z) by the corre-
sponding cell volume (Volx,z) and summing the results for all
cells:
Mass ¼
X
s
x¼1
X
n
z¼1
DOx;z  Volx;z
(1)
where
Mass ¼ total
volume-weighted
oxygen
mass
(kg),
DOx,z ¼ oxygen concentration in section (x) and layer (z),
Volx,z ¼ cell volume corresponding to section (x) and layer (z),
s ¼ number of sections, and n ¼ number of layers.
Dividing mass by total volume yields the volume-weighted
oxygen
concentration,
thus
normalizing
the
data
for
comparison among years and between reservoirs. An analo-
gous approach was used to estimate the metalimnetic oxygen
content.
2.3.3.
Hypolimnetic oxygen demand (HOD)
HODmass is commonly calculated by dividing the mass
differential by the time differential between two consecutive
sampling days (Davis et al., 1987) or by plotting hypolimnion
oxygen content against time and ﬁnding the slope of the
regression line through the data (Lorenzen and Fast, 1977).
However, closer examination of these methods has revealed
that volume ﬂuctuations resulting from thermocline move-
ment (as discussed in Section 2.3.1) can cause variations in
results for HOD. To take hypolimnion volume variability into
account, two calculation approaches were employed based
on the regression method outlined by Lorenzen and Fast
(1977) and applied to: (1) oxygen mass, with corrected hypo-
limnetic volume ﬂuctuations, and (2) oxygen concentration,
and multiplying by the averaged hypolimnion volume for
speciﬁc time periods. Results of the two methods, which had
an average error between them of less than 1%, were aver-
aged to determine oxygen depletion (HODmass) and accumu-
lation rates. Dividing HODmass by each period’s hypolimnion
volume results in a volume-averaged hypolimnion oxygen
demand based on concentration, HODconc. The metalimnetic
oxygen demand (MOD) was estimated using an analogous
approach.
As discussed in Section 3.1, settling organic detritus accu-
mulates in the metalimnion and exerts a disproportionate and
localized oxygen demand. The MOD is of interest because
detritus
settling
through
the
metalimnion
subsequently
enters the hypolimnion where it may contribute to HOD via
both WOD and eventually SOD. An important assumption in
calculating MOD (as well as HOD) is that vertical transport of
oxygen (from the epilimnion down into the metalimnion, and
from the hypolimnion up into the metalimnion) may be
neglected. A rough analysis of the oxygen concentration
gradients immediately above and below the metalimnion
suggested that these combined vertical ﬂuxes were small
relative to the calculated MOD.

Oxygenation and bubble-plume model predictions
Bubble plumes release oxygen bubbles directly into the
hypolimnion in contrast to other oxygen transfer devices (for
example, the Speece Cone (Moore, 2003; Singleton and Little,
2006) or air-lift aerator (Burris et al., 2002)) that entrain
hypolimnetic water and discharge oxygen-enriched water
through an engineered structure. When designed appropri-
ately, bubble-plume diffusers add oxygen to the deep waters
of the hypolimnion via a detraining bubble plume that induces
circulation
and
distributes
newly-oxygenated
water
throughout
the
hypolimnion,
while
preserving
thermal
structure (McGinnis et al., 2004; Singleton and Little, 2006;
Singleton et al., 2007).
A linear bubble-plume model, validated by Singleton et al.
(2007), was used to predict the rate at which oxygen was added
to the hypolimnion on each day of operation that data were
collected. Input variables for the model are water column
proﬁles (temperature, conductivity and oxygen concentra-
tion), gas ﬂow rate, percent oxygen content in the supply gas,
initial bubble size and diffuser characteristics (depth, width
and length). Model outputs include oxygen addition rate,
depth of maximum plume rise (DMPR), equilibrium depth (ED)
and the predicted oxygen and temperature proﬁles within the
plume. DMPR is the height within the water column to which
the plume water rises before detraining while ED, which does
not account for further entrainment into the detraining plume
water, is the estimated depth to which the plume water
returns (the depth at which the ambient density is equal to
that of the detraining plume). The oxygen addition rate pre-
dicted by the plume model was compared to hypolimnion
accumulation rates to determine HODmass during periods of
diffuser operation.
2.3.5.
Induced HOD
Induced HOD is calculated by comparing background oxygen
depletion rates measured before diffuser operation began
with those observed during oxygenation. Depletion rates
during
oxygenation
are
calculated
from
the
difference
between predicted oxygen addition (plume model output) and
observed hypolimnetic oxygen accumulation (water column
analysis). The actual addition rate is expected to be relatively
constant because (1) ﬂow control was maintained by an Alicat
Scientiﬁc digital mass ﬂow controller and (2) the bulk oxygen
concentration (Cbulk) of w10 mg l1 is much lower than the
saturated oxygen concentration (Csat) in the deep water of the
hypolimnion at approximately 3 and 7 bar for CCR and SHR,
respectively. An increase in the bulk dissolved oxygen
concentration of a few milligrams per liter is therefore small
relative to the overall concentration driving force (Csat  Cbulk).
Diminished oxygen accumulation rates are thus primarily
caused by an increased rate of oxygen consumption.
2.3.6.
Hypolimnetic mixing
Mixing throughout the water column can occur naturally due
to wind-driven processes (Eckert et al., 2002) or artiﬁcially due
to oxygenation. Natural and artiﬁcial mixing in the hypolim-
nion can cause: (1) increased turbulence in the hypolimnion
(Ashley, 1981, 1983); (2) enhanced rates of hypolimnion
warming (Soltero et al., 1994; Thomas et al., 1994); (3)
increased SOD (Moore et al., 1996; Moore, 2003; Beutel et al.,
2007); and (4) a uniform temperature throughout the hypo-
limnion. Hypolimnetic warming is perhaps the easiest to
quantify, and is used to evaluate the effect of diffuser-induced
mixing.
2.3.7.
Hypolimnetic warming
The
rate
of
hypolimnetic
warming
is
calculated
using
a method similar to that used for oxygen mass (Section 2.3.2).
CTD proﬁles were converted to uniform 0.1-m layers for each
section. The resulting section (x)–layer (z) grid divided the
reservoir into cells, each with a known temperature. The
change in sensible heat for each cell was found by multiplying
the
temperature
difference
between
sample
days
(Tx,y þ 1,z  Tx,y,z) by the corresponding cell mass (mx,y,z) and
the sensible heat coefﬁcient (c) and then summing over each
layer:
Qz ¼
X
s
x¼1
X
p

mx;y;z  c 

where Qz ¼ change in sensible heat of layer (z) (kJ), mx,y,z ¼ water
mass for section (x), day ( y), at layer (z) (kg), c ¼ 4.190 kJ kg1
C1, Tx,y,z ¼ cell temperature for section (x), day ( y), at layer (z)
(C), s ¼ number of sections, and p ¼ sample day.
Dividing sensible heat by the number of days during the
sample period yields a rate of change of sensible heat for each
layer, which is then plotted as a function of elevation.
Summing the rate of change of heat over all hypolimnion
layers and normalizing by hypolimnion volume generates the
total rate of change of heat per unit hypolimnion volume,
which is used to evaluate hypolimnetic warming at different
applied gas ﬂow rates.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Hypolimnetic anoxia
The oxygenation system in SHR was not operated in 2001,
allowing baseline conditions without diffuser operation to be
established. The development of hypolimnetic anoxia during
this period is revealed in Fig. 3, with dissolved oxygen
isopleths created using oxygen proﬁle data collected from
a single location at the deepest point in the reservoir. The
12 C temperature isopleth is also shown, indicating the
approximate boundary between the metalimnion and the
hypolimnion.
Fig. 3 shows the net effect on the water column of all
oxygen-depleting processes (chemical and biological). The
evaluation
of
HOD
is
based
on
all
oxygen-consuming
processes in the hypolimnion and includes WOD, which is
primarily caused by detrital decomposition, and SOD, which
encompasses biological and chemical processes largely asso-
ciated with organic matter decomposition (Davis et al., 1987).
Fig. 3 shows that HOD is driven by oxygen depletion both at
the bottom of the hypolimnion due to SOD and in the hypo-
limnetic water column due to WOD from settling organic
detritus. Additionally, MOD, which is caused by detritus
accumulating in the metalimnion, reduces the amount of

oxygen available for subsequent detrital degradation. When
the accumulated detritus ﬁnally settles through the metal-
imnion into the hypolimnion during the latter part of the
summer, this organic material exerts a higher WOD in the
hypolimnion, because it has not been degraded to the same
extent as that entering the hypolimnion during the earlier part
of the summer.
Algal growth in the epilimnion occurred between Julian
day 220 and 260 and subsequently exerts MOD as the algae
settle and begin to decompose. Detrital buildup in the metal-
imnion occurs as particle settling velocities decrease due to
water density changes as particles sink from warmer to colder
water. As an illustration, temperatures in SHR in August are
commonly 23 C in the epilimnion and 5 C in the hypolim-
nion. Using Stoke’s Law and assuming a particle diameter of
140 mm and a density of 1100 kg m3 (particle size ranges from
20 to 200 mm and densities range from 1030 to 1230 kg m3
(Agusti et al., 1987; Weilenmann et al., 1989)), the settling
velocity decreases from about 0.4 to 0.3 m day1 as the particle
sinks through the metalimnion. The resulting accumulation
of organic material therefore exerts a disproportionate oxygen
demand at this depth, which can lead to what is known as
a ‘‘metalimnetic minimum’’ in oxygen concentration.
Hypoxic conditions in the hypolimnion were observed to
progress upwards from the reservoir bottom over time (Fig. 3).
This demonstrates the impact that SOD has on oxygen in the
hypolimnion, and coincides with the results of Davis et al.
(1987) which showed that SOD comprised w80% of HOD
during early stratiﬁcation.
The decreased oxygen levels in the upper hypolimnion
shown in Fig. 3 suggest that the oxygen demand associated
with setting detritus (WOD) became noticeable in mid-August
(wday 225). Closer examination of Fig. 3 indicates that settling
detritus clearly affected hypolimnion oxygen concentrations
by early October (wday 260). As the lower hypolimnion is
essentially anoxic at this point, the dominant contributor to
HOD shifts from SOD to WOD during late stratiﬁcation, as
observed by Davis et al. (1987). Because vertical diffusion of
oxygen
is
insufﬁcient
to
eliminate
the
metalimnetic
minimum, the only way for oxygen to increase in the metal-
imnion is if the oxygen-consuming detritus is removed. As the
accumulated organic material ﬁnally settles through the
metalimnion and enters the hypolimnion, the oxygen demand
associated with the decomposition of this material shifts from
the metalimnion (allowing oxygen to increase in this layer) to
the hypolimnion (causing an increase in WOD). SOD at this
stage is curtailed by the large volume of anoxic water above the
sediment. By the end of October (wday 300), the metalimnion
is also anoxic, limiting further detrital decomposition in that
region. Organic detritus continues to settle from the anoxic
metalimnion into the hypolimnion, which is close to being
completely anoxic. The incompletely-oxidized detritus, now
undergoing slower anaerobic decomposition, settles to the
bottom and becomes incorporated in the surface sediment,
from where it can again exert an oxygen demand when oxygen
becomes available after the annual overturn.
3.2.
HOD and gas ﬂow rates
As stated previously, the change in HODmass prior to the start
of diffuser operation represents the background depletion
rate. During diffuser operation, HODmass was calculated as the
difference between observed water column accumulation and
oxygen addition predicted by the plume model. For example,

an 8.5 NCMH (5 SCFM) oxygen ﬂow rate applied to the diffuser
in SHR yielded a predicted oxygen addition rate of 266 kg
day1. The observed oxygen accumulation rate in the hypo-
limnion during this period was 181 kg day1. The calculated
HODmass during the period was therefore w85 kg day1.
The oxygenation systems were operated at gas ﬂow rates
ranging from 2 to 50 NCMH (1 to 30 SCFM) and 17 to 102 NCMH
(10 to 60 SCFM) in SHR and CCR, respectively. HODmass and the
corresponding applied gas ﬂow rates are plotted in Fig. 4,
revealing a linear relationship for both SHR and CCR. The
intercept for both regression lines represents the background
HODmass for each reservoir and the corresponding P-values for
SHR and CCR are 2.0  106 and 2.3  1011 respectively. The
increase
in
HODmass
above
the
background
represents
induced HODmass. For example, during the initial years
following
oxygenation
at
SHR,
calculated
background
HODmass was observed to be w50 kg day1. At 17 NCMH, the
HODmass is w150 kg day1; 50 kg day1due to background
depletion and 100 kg day1 induced by operating the diffuser.
The same ﬂow rate applied to CCR would yield an induced
demand of w370 kg day1, with an overall HODmass of w790 kg
day1.
To account for the induced oxygen demand associated
with the operation of aeration and oxygenation systems, it
has been suggested that a factor of safety should be used
(Cooke et al., 2005). Results supporting the need for such
a safety factor show that the induced demand: (1) is caused by
increased SOD (Cooke et al., 2005); (2) ranges from a factor of
1.5 to 4.0 (Soltero et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1996; Prepas et al.,
1997; Beutel, 2003); and (3) is dependent on hypolimnion size
(Cooke et al., 2005). Our research builds on these results by
showing that induced demand: (1) is caused by both SOD and
WOD; (2) ranges beyond a factor of 6.0; and (3) is strongly
dependent on applied gas ﬂow rate, but is essentially inde-
pendent of hypolimnion size (as discussed in Section 2.3.3).
Increasing the gas ﬂow rate to the diffuser increases the
degree of mixing and the oxygen concentration in the hypo-
limnion and both of these factors could theoretically increase
HOD. Elevated oxygen concentrations increase the driving
force for oxygen transfer across the DBL at the SWI, which
increases the ﬂux of oxygen into the sediments (Rasmussen
and
Jorgensen,
1992).
Increased
turbulence
results
in
a decreased DBL thickness, which would also increase the ﬂux
of oxygen into the sediments (Jorgensen and Revsbech, 1985;
Mackenthun and Stefan, 1998; Moore, 2003; Beutel et al., 2007).
To establish which of these two effects (oxygen concentration
versus turbulent mixing) is most signiﬁcant, we ﬁrst exam-
ined the rate of diffuser-induced hypolimnetic warming
caused by the bubble plume and then evaluated the depen-
dence of HOD on bulk water oxygen concentration.
3.3.
Hypolimnetic warming
Temperature proﬁles were analyzed during each ﬂow period
to determine the rate of hypolimnetic warming. Fig. 5 shows
warming rate versus elevation for the range of gas ﬂow rates
applied to the SHR diffuser. The data for each period of
diffuser
operation
are
truncated
at
the
hypolimnion
boundary. Higher rates of warming in the upper hypolimnion
indicate warmer water from the metalimnion mixing with the
upper hypolimnion. Fig. 5 clearly shows higher warming rates
throughout the hypolimnion at higher gas ﬂow rates, con-
ﬁrming the occurrence of plume-induced mixing. A similar
effect was observed in CCR, although the data are not shown
here.
To more closely relate mixing to gas ﬂow rates, total
warming rates per unit hypolimnion volume (kJ m3 day 1)
were calculated for both SHR and CCR, as shown in Fig. 6. The
observed hypolimnetic warming rates in SHR were calculated
over a range of applied gas ﬂow rates and over a period of
several years (2003–2007). Similar data for CCR (for the years
2005–2007) are also plotted in Fig. 6. The variability in warming

rates at similar applied gas ﬂow rates (particularly for CCR)
shows that hypolimnetic warming is also affected by external
conditions, such as the wind. Despite these weather-related
effects, a linear relationship between applied gas ﬂow rate and
diffuser-induced mixing is evident in Fig. 6. A regression of the
data set yields P-values of 0.0086 and 6.4  105 for CCR and
SHR, respectively. Overall, the relationship between hypo-
limnetic warming and gas ﬂow rate (Fig. 6) is quite similar to
that between HODmass and gas ﬂow rate (Fig. 4), suggesting
that mixing induced by the bubble plume is an important
contributor to the increase in HOD.
3.4.
Effect of bulk oxygen concentration on HOD
Mass transfer theory suggests that SOD is regulated by
hydrodynamic forces in the water overlying the sediment
coupled with the oxygen concentration driving force between
the bulk water and the sediment (Cbulk  Csed) (Jorgensen and
Revsbech, 1985). SHR’s low background HOD allowed several
months of data to be collected before oxygenation was
required. The low oxygen demand also provided an opportu-
nity to operate the diffuser at ﬂow rates low enough to mini-
mize induced mixing and the related oxygen demand. Fig. 7
shows volume-averaged oxygen concentration in SHR during
summer
stratiﬁcation,
but
prior
to
diffuser
operation
(2004–2006) and during diffuser operation at a low ﬂow rate
(2007–2008). The gas ﬂow rate during 2007 and 2008 was only
1.3 NCMH and 0.61 NCMH, respectively. Fig. 7 shows that the
initial volume-averaged hypolimnion oxygen concentration
increased each year, while the slope of the data (representing
HODconc) is essentially constant. The initial DO and corre-
sponding HODconc for each year is summarized in Table 2,
conﬁrming that the higher bulk DO does not cause an increase
in HODconc.
It has been observed that higher oxygen concentrations
can cause increased depletion rates (Jorgensen and Revsbech,
1985). Our results, however, show that despite maintaining an
elevated oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion, the
depletion rate did not increase. To further evaluate these
results, we performed the same analysis on the metalimnion
data, which show the same trend to that observed in the
hypolimnion, as shown in Fig. 7. Increased oxygen concen-
trations in the bulk water did not result in elevated depletion
rates in either hypolimnion or metalimnion. In fact, the
opposite was observed as HODconc tended to decrease over
time. Overall, Table 2 shows that the individual depletion
rates (HODconc and MODconc), as well as the combined deple-
tion rate, decreased in SHR between 2003 and 2008. It can
therefore be concluded that induced HOD is primarily caused
by mixing. Relatively constant background depletion rates
shown in Fig. 8 and Table 2 for 2004–2006 further suggest that
HOD is a zero-order process with respect to oxygen concen-
tration. Additionally, the higher initial concentrations for
2004–2006 (see Fig. 7) have no apparent effect on the subse-
quent
depletion
rate,
again
suggesting
a
zero-order
consumption process. In summary, Fig. 8 shows that (1) the
overall WOD from the metalimnion and the hypolimnion has
decreased with continued oxygenation and (2) the WOD
appears to shift from the hypolimnion to the metalimnion.
These changes in WOD during diffuser operation are therefore
not related to oxygen concentration, but are likely controlled
by mechanisms related to increased turbulence, including the
residence time of settling organic matter in the hypolimnion.

hypolimnion. The idea is that settling material is stirred up,
prolonging the residence time of the organic detritus in the
aerobic decomposition zone and subsequently ‘‘extending’’
the depth of the hypolimnion through which this material
must settle. This was evaluated in CCR by deploying sediment
traps. The traps were positioned 2 m above the sediment at
locations directly over different points of the diffuser (sample
locations CC, CB and CE) and at locations 600 and 1150 m away
from the diffuser (sample locations C2 and C3, respectively).
The sediment traps were monitored bi-weekly for total solids
between September and October, 2006. The results from
September 25, October 2 and October 20 show increased
accumulation in the sediment traps directly over the diffuser
(17,900, 17,700 and 24,600 mg l1) compared to those posi-
tioned further away (6400, 7300 and 4700 mg l1). These results
support the effective depth concept by suggesting that parti-
cles in the vicinity of the diffuser remain suspended in the
water column due to mixing induced by the bubble plume.
Increasing the period of time that organic matter remains
suspended in the water column allows more complete
oxidation, which leads to an increase in WOD. It has been
shown that oxygen transfer into settling sediment particles is
much higher than for settled particles accumulated at the
sediment surface. Compared to particles at the SWI, discrete
settling particles have a much higher speciﬁc surface area and
a much thinner diffusive boundary layer (Jorgensen and
Revsbech, 1985).

Long-term reduction of background HOD
To test the hypothesis that oxygenation over several years
may decrease HOD (McQueen and Lean, 1984; Matinvesi, 1996;
Moore et al., 1996; Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006a), an analysis of
HODconc and MODconc was performed during periods when the
diffuser was not in operation. Because the low applied gas
ﬂow rate was observed to induce negligible oxygen demand
(as discussed in Section 3.4), data were also analyzed for
periods when the diffuser was in operation (2007–2008). In
2003–2006, HODconc and MODconc were calculated based on
data collected during similar periods of stratiﬁcation. In
contrast, HODconc and MODconc values for 2007 and 2008
(collected between April and October) were calculated as net
oxygen demand, which is the difference between measured
accumulation in the hypolimnion and the addition rate pre-
dicted by the bubble plume. Because the 2003–2006 data
represent HODconc during periods without oxygenation and
the 2007 and 2008 data do not include any induced demand,
these rates are all equivalent to background HODconc values.
Fig. 8 shows, a decreasing trend in background HODconc over
time.
Several factors may contribute to the observed decrease in
HODconc and MODconc over time. Variations in hypolimnion
volume could theoretically affect oxygen depletion rates
because the sediment surface area contributing to SOD is
a function of hypolimnion volume. However, hypolimnion
volumes were determined and no statistical relationship
between HODconc and hypolimnetic volume was found.
Oxygen depletion rates may also be affected by changes in
organic loading. Decreased levels of organic matter in the
water column would require less oxygen for decomposition,
resulting in reduced HOD. However, MODconc remained rela-
tively constant over time (Fig. 8), which suggests that organic
loading also remained relatively constant. It is therefore
concluded that the reduction in HOD is caused by a reduction
in oxygen consumption processes (e.g., decreasing SOD in
subsequent years by more complete organic matter decom-
position in the current year).

Long-term reduction of induced HOD
The decrease in background HODconc for SHR represents
a
signiﬁcant
beneﬁt of
long-term oxygenation.
Because
historical data for CCR are not available to verify this obser-
vation, the possibility of a decreasing induced HODconc was
investigated. This analysis was performed using data from
SHR (2004–2008) and CCR (2006–2007) prior to the onset of the
metalimnetic minimum to avoid effective depth inﬂuences on
induced HOD. Variations in induced HODconc were tracked as
a function of applied gas ﬂow rate. At equivalent gas ﬂow
rates, induced HODconc was observed to decrease over time in
both SHR and CCR (data not shown). Furthermore, increasing
the gas ﬂow rate during more recent years induced approxi-
mately the same HODconc observed at lower ﬂow rates in
previous years. For example, SHR diffuser operation in 2006 at
8.5 and 17 NCMH resulted in similar HODconc rates in 2005 at
ﬂow rates of 3.4 and 8.5 NCMH, respectively. Likewise induced
HODconc values in CCR during 2007 at ﬂow rates of 51 and
85 NCMH were similar to induced HODconc values during 2006
at ﬂow rates of 34 and 51 NCMH, respectively. These decreases
in induced oxygen demand support the results showing long-
term decreases in background oxygen demand.
Decreased HOD over time is also revealed in the applied gas
ﬂow rates. In SHR, the applied gas ﬂow rate during 2007 was
1.3 NCMH, but was reduced to 0.6 NCMH for 2008. Despite this
50% reduction in oxygen addition rate, the volume-averaged
hypolimnion oxygen concentration was much higher in 2008
than in 2007 (see Fig. 7). In CCR, the applied gas ﬂow rate to the
diffuser was decreased from 68 NCMH in 2005 to 51 NCMH in
2008 while similar levels of water quality were maintained.

Conclusions
Hypolimnetic oxygenation systems were operated in two
reservoirs (SHR and CCR) over a wide range of applied gas ﬂow
rates. Temperature and oxygen proﬁles were collected during
key experimental periods from 2003 to 2008 to monitor
hypolimnetic warming and oxygen depletion rates. A linear-
bubble-plume model was used to estimate the rate of oxygen
addition to the hypolimnion. Major conclusions are:
1. Accelerated warming was observed in both reservoirs, but
was not substantial enough to signiﬁcantly disrupt thermal
stratiﬁcation. The rate of warming was shown to be
a function of the applied gas ﬂow rate, indicating that
hypolimnetic
warming
is
a
consequence
of
diffuser-
induced mixing.
2. Applied gas ﬂow rate and resulting diffuser-induced mixing
were also found to strongly inﬂuence HOD. HOD was
observed
to
increase
in
response
to
mixing-induced
increases in the effective depth of the hypolimnion.
3. HOD was shown to be independent of oxygen concentra-
tion in the hypolimnion, indicating that HOD is a zero-order
process with respect to oxygen concentration.
4. Although induced mixing was found to increase HOD in the
short-term,
oxygenation
over
longer
periods
of
time
(several years) appears to decrease background HOD as well
as the degree of induced HOD.
In
summary,
despite
increased
oxygen
demand and
warming in the hypolimnion during diffuser operation, the
oxygenation systems were able to replenish hypolimnetic
oxygen in both CCR and SHR and eventually caused a decrease
in both background and diffuser-induced HOD. Hypolimnetic
oxygenation remains a viable method for managing source
waters in drinking-water-supply reservoirs.

Soluble metals such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) often reach problematic levels in
water-supply reservoirs during summer stratiﬁcation following the onset of hypolimnetic
hypoxia. The behavior of soluble and particulate Fe and Mn was studied following the
installation of a hypolimnetic oxygenation system in Carvins Cove Reservoir, a water-
supply
impoundment

by
the

Water
Authority.
During

hypolimnion
(<0.05 mg l1), but high concentrations (>2.0 mg l1) were still observed in the benthic
region close to the sediment, despite near-sediment dissolved oxygen concentrations in
excess of 5.0 mg l1. Oxygenation appears to affect the location of the oxic/anoxic boundary
sufﬁciently to restrict substantial transport of soluble Mn to the bulk water of the hypo-
limnion. However, the position of the oxic/anoxic boundary was not uniformly affected
along the reservoir bottom, allowing horizontal transport of soluble Mn from higher
elevations in contact with hypoxic sediments. During one summer, when the oxygen
system was turned off for a month, the soluble Mn in the bulk hypolimnion increased
substantially. Oxygen concentrations were quickly restored after the system was turned
back on, but elevated levels of soluble Mn persisted until the sedimentation rate of detritus
through the hypolimnion increased. When operated without interruption, the oxygenation
system was able to reduce the bulk average hypolimnion soluble Mn concentration by up to
97%, indicating that source water control of soluble Mn and Fe can be accomplished with
hypolimnetic oxygenation in water-supply reservoirs.

Introduction
Manganese (Mn) is a nuisance contaminant for the water
treatmentindustry(Stauffer,1986),whichtendstoremaininthe

conditions (dissolved oxygen (DO) <16% of saturation; Baden
etal.,1995).Itisespeciallyprevalentattheoxic/anoxicboundary
or redoxcline (Kristiansen et al., 2002; Granina et al., 2004;
Koretsky et al., 2006). Manganese has complicated redox
kinetics and is very difﬁcult to chemically oxidize in pH envi-
ronments typical of natural waters (pH 6–8) (Baden et al., 1995;
Kristiansen et al., 2002; Roitz et al., 2002), often persisting in
soluble forms despite unfavorable thermodynamics (Balzer,
1982; Dortch and Hamlin-Tillman, 1995). Mn-oxidizing micro-
bial communities are often necessary for oxidation (Crittenden
et al., 2005; Gabelich et al., 2006). Iron, in contrast, is easily

Soluble Fe/Mn is typically managed during the treatment
process by applying oxidants such as potassium permanga-
nate, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, or ozone. Even though Mn can
be oxidized via chemical addition and pH manipulation, it has
been observed to resolubilize in sedimentation basins due to
the formation of anoxic regions within the settled sludge
(Budd et al., 2007). Managing Mn in the treatment process can
be difﬁcult and there is growing interest in improving raw
water quality before it enters the treatment plant, essentially
making the reservoir itself the ﬁrst stage in the water treat-
ment process.
Several methods of lake and reservoir management have
been employed to address anoxia and its negative effects,
including aeration (using compressed air as oxygen supply),
oxygenation (using pure oxygen as oxygen supply) (Beutel and
Horne, 1999; Singleton and Little, 2006), and artiﬁcial destra-
tiﬁcation. Published research on source water control of Mn,
however, is limited primarily to artiﬁcial destratiﬁcation
(Burns, 1998; Zaw and Chiswell, 1999; Ismail et al., 2002; Chi-
pofya and Matapa, 2003; Grochowska and Gawronska, 2004)
and laboratory experiments (Beutel et al., 2007). In addition,
there are conﬂicting results on the behavior of Mn with
respect to oxic conditions near the sediment–water interface.
Beutel et al. (2007) performed laboratory experiments and
reported that maintenance of a well-oxygenated sediment–
water interface would decrease or inhibit the accumulation of
Mn in the overlying waters. In contrast, the in situ experi-
ments of Pakhomova et al. (2007) showed that Mn ﬂuxes from
sediments were independent of oxygen conditions over the
sediment, suggesting that Mn ﬂuxes were driven by Mn
deposits at or just below the sediment–water interface, which
control the Mn gradient between the sediment porewater and
overlying waters. These conﬂicting results, coupled with the
fact that published research on reservoir management is
predominantly focused on artiﬁcial mixing, justify the need
for further research on controlling Mn in source water. This
research directly addresses this issue by studying a full-scale
hypolimnetic oxygenation system installed to control Mn in
a drinking water-supply reservoir. In light of the emerging
global drinking water crisis (NRC, 2004) and increasing prob-
lems with Mn removal in treatment plants (Kohl and Medlar,
2006), ﬁnding alternative methods to improve water supplies
is crucial.
The Western Virginia Water Authority maintains several
water-supply reservoirs in southwest Virginia. Carvins Cove
Reservoir has traditionally experienced increased soluble Mn
concentrations in the hypolimnion during summer stratiﬁ-
cation, resulting in inﬂuent Mn levels at the treatment plant
being too high for successful treatment. Although Fe has been
much less of a problem than Mn, Carvins Cove experienced
increased Fe levels during summer stratiﬁcation as well. The
Western Virginia Water Authority installed an oxygenation
system (also referred to as a diffuser) in Carvins Cove in 2005
to address summer anoxia and to control Mn and Fe in the
bulk hypolimnion. In this study, we provide detailed results of
Mn and Fe behavior in both soluble and particulate forms at
various locations in the reservoir during artiﬁcial oxygenation
of the hypolimnion. We consider the distribution of DO within
the reservoir, mixing induced by the oxygenation system, and
the effect that the location of the oxic/anoxic boundary has on
dissolved metals and their subsequent mobility during both
the stratiﬁed summer and naturally mixed winter periods.

Materials and methods
2.1.
Study site
Carvins Cove (Fig. 1) is a man-made, monomictic, and eutro-
phic water-supply reservoir for the City of Roanoke and
surrounding counties in southwestern Virginia, USA. Carvins
Cove is located on a private, heavily forested watershed and is
supplied by two natural tributaries that ﬂow from agricultur-
ally dominated lands and by two creeks from an adjoining
watershed that are routed through diversion tunnels. Carvins
Cove experiences increased soluble metals concentrations
and subsequent poor water quality during summer stratiﬁ-
cation as a result of hypolimnetic anoxia. Two linear bubble-
plume diffusers (considered as a single oxygenation system)
were installed and supplied with pure oxygen in 2005 to
improve water quality during summer stratiﬁcation. Carvins
Cove has a maximum depth of 23 m, a surface area of 2.5 km2,
and a volume of 24 hm3. Other characteristics of the reservoir
and the oxygenation system have been summarized else-
where (Gantzer et al., in press).
2.2.
Data collection and analysis
Monthly water samples were collected between 1999 and 2005
by Carvins Cove staff at each withdrawal elevation at the
water intake tower. There are six water withdrawal elevations
positioned 3.1 m apart, with the highest located at 353.6 m
elevation, which is 3.1 m below the surface at full pool. During
this preliminary phase (1999–2005), samples were analyzed for
total Fe and Mn by the colorimetric spectrophotometer
method (Clesceri et al., 1998).
After the oxygenation system was installed, the sampling
strategy was modiﬁed to more closely monitor Fe and Mn.
This included water column samples collected with a 1.2-L
Kemmerer bottle as a function of depth and sediment pore-
water samples collected with in situ porewater analyzers
(‘‘peepers’’; Hesslein, 1976) from a single location in 2006 (CC)
and from two locations in 2007 (CC and C3) (see Fig. 1). CC is
located at the deepest point in the reservoir, which is
approximately 150 m from the intake tower and has a bottom
elevation of 335.3 m (21.3 m deep). C3 is located approximately
2000 m upstream of CC and has a bottom elevation of 341.4 m
(15.2 m deep). In addition to the six withdrawal elevation
sample depths, a bottom sample depth was added following
the installation of the oxygenation system at an elevation
located just above the sediment (353.3 m). The additional
sample depth was collected as close to the sediment as
possible, which was approximately within 0.3 m of the
bottom, and is referred to as the benthic region. Samples for
total metal analyses were transferred from the Kemmerer
bottle directly to pre-acidiﬁed plastic bottles. Samples for
soluble metals were ﬁltered through 0.45 mm Millipore ﬁlter
paper before being transferred to pre-acidiﬁed plastic bottles.
All samples collected during 2006 and 2007 were analyzed for
Fe and Mn concentrations using the inductively coupled

plasma (ICP) method (Clesceri et al., 1998). Sediment traps
were also deployed in Carvins Cove in 2007 and were posi-
tioned 2 m above the sediment at three locations in the
immediate vicinity of the diffuser and at locations 600 and
1150 m away from the diffuser (Fig. 1), which were monitored
bi-weekly for Fe, Mn, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and total
solids between September and October.
2.3.
Water column proﬁles
A Seabird Electronics SBE 19plus (4 Hz sampling rate) high-
resolution proﬁler (CTD) was used to collect conductivity,
temperature and DO proﬁles throughout the year. The DO
probe has a response time of 1.4 s at 20 C, allowing data to
be
collected at about
0.1 m increments.
The
CTD
has
a stainless steel cage around it, thus allowing positioning
within a few centimeters of the bottom. To verify these
measurements, bottom DO proﬁles obtained with the CTD
were compared to microsensor DO proﬁles obtained from
extracted sediment cores and in situ measurements (Bryant
et al., in preparation) and were found to be essentially the
same.
Stratiﬁcation in Carvins Cove begins in April and the
thermal structure typically stabilizes in May. The reservoir
usually remains stratiﬁed until it is naturally mixed in early
November. Water column proﬁles were collected three times
per week during summer stratiﬁcation and bi-weekly during
the completely mixed winter period along a longitudinal
transect at seven locations, as shown in Fig. 1. These loca-
tions span the entire hypolimnion, including locations both
upstream and downstream of the diffuser. Water column
proﬁles were used to identify the thermocline position (as
deﬁned by Wetzel, 1975), to determine metalimnion and
hypolimnion DO (Gantzer et al., in press), and to estimate the
relative location of the oxic/anoxic boundary.
2.4.
Oxygenation system (diffuser) operation
The oxygenation system (diffuser) was installed and ﬁrst
operated in August 2005. It has subsequently been in contin-
uous operation, with the exception of a month-long test
period (between June 15 and July 14, 2006) when the oxygen
supply was turned off. The diffuser was operated at ﬂow rates
ranging from w8 to 100 normal cubic meters per hour (NCMH)
with the applied gas ﬂow rate based on DO requirements
needed to maintain DO in the bulk water at or above 7 mg l1.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Historical observations
Contour plots of soluble Fe and Mn (using a Kriging interpo-
lation scheme) based on monthly water column samples are
shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The DO concentration
isopleth of 5.0 mg l1 is superimposed as a blue line labeled
‘DO 5’. Focusing on the historical data obtained during the
years preceding diffuser installation in 2005, Figs. 2 and 3
show that concentrations of soluble Fe/Mn ﬂuctuated annu-
ally, that low DO coincided with increased soluble Fe/Mn in
the
bulk
water
during
summer
stratiﬁcation,
and
that
increased DO during naturally mixed winter conditions par-
alleled lower soluble Fe/Mn concentrations.
It is clear from Fig. 2 that reduced Fe reached problem
levels following the annual depletion of DO. When DO in the
bottom water was replenished due to mixing after fall turn-
over, soluble Fe quickly decreased. In contrast, Mn oxidation is
less directly controlled and not so easily explained, as
expected based on the complex Mn redox kinetics previously
discussed. Thus, the behavior of Mn in response to elevated

Comparison between stratiﬁed and naturally
mixed periods
More recent Mn data (collected after diffuser installation) with
increased temporal sampling resolution are detailed in Fig. 4
(with no distortion as a result of interpolation), which shows
soluble Mn concentrations in the benthic region and at three
elevations in the water column (338.3, 341.4 and 344.4 m)
representing the bulk of the hypolimnetic water during both
2006 and 2007. In the naturally mixed winter period, the water
column is isothermal, which promotes a more uniform
distribution of DO as well as turbulence at the sediment–water
interface, thus driving the oxic/anoxic boundary deeper into
the sediment (Balzer, 1982; Granina et al., 2004; Katsev et al.,
2007). It is hypothesized that large-scale dilution, oxidation
and precipitation (Yagi, 1996; Michard et al., 2001), coupled
with the movement of the oxic/anoxic boundary into the
sediment on a reservoir-wide scale and the corresponding
shift in the Mn-oxidizing microbial community, are factors
that control the decrease in Mn concentrations during winter,
as shown in Fig. 4 between December 2006 and April 2007.
During summer stratiﬁcation, the hypolimnion is isolated
from the epilimnion and becomes relatively quiescent, as
described by Schoemann et al. (1998). The isolated hypo-
limnetic water experiences DO depletion, which can lead to
hypoxia (Gantzer et al., in press). The quiescence and low
levels of DO at the sediment–water interface cause the oxic/
anoxic boundary to move out of the sediment and into the
water column, allowing reductively solubilized species, such
as Fe and Mn, to be released into the overlying water (Kris-
tiansen et al., 2002; Roitz et al., 2002).

To estimate the relative position of the oxic/anoxic
boundary, bottom DO measurements (obtained with the CTD
cage resting on the sediment surface) along the reservoir were
analyzed. The bottom DO measurements followed a similar
trend to the bulk hypolimnion DO, but were consistently
lower. Fig. 5 shows the volume-averaged hypolimnion DO
(Gantzer et al., in press) and the lowest recorded bottom DO of
the seven sample locations. The lowest bottom DO was
observed at CC, where the bottom depth is below the diffuser,
and at C3, located approximately 1500 m up-reservoir from
the diffuser. The bottom DO measurements indicate that
conditions were favorable for the oxic/anoxic boundary to be
positioned in the water column during summer hypoxia.
During summers when the oxygenation system was in
operation (2006 and 2007), mixing in the hypolimnion is
primarily governed by diffuser operation (Gantzer et al., in
press). Increased turbulence in the hypolimnion has been
shown to cause a decrease in the thickness of the diffusive
boundary layer, a viscous layer of water immediately above
the sediment–water interface (Lorke et al., 2003; Hondzo
et al., 2005). Although variations in diffusive boundary layer
thickness were measured at locations both near and far from
the diffuser (Bryant et al., in preparation), thus indicating
turbulence in the hypolimnion, the degree of induced mixing
is lower and less uniform than that observed during natu-
rally mixed conditions in winter. This is apparent in Fig. 5
which shows that, regardless of applied gas ﬂow rate or bulk
hypolimnion DO concentration, the oxygenation system did
not produce equivalent DO conditions uniformly at the
bottom.
3.3.
Diffuser operation in 2006
During 2006, the oxygenation system was shut down between
June 15 and July 14 in order to allow hypoxic sediment
conditions to develop as part of an experiment designed to
ascertain the full effect of the oxygenation system on the oxic/
anoxic boundary without the inﬂuence of winter mixing.
Following the 1-month shut down, the applied gas ﬂow rate
was steadily increased (see Fig. 5). The volume-averaged
hypolimnion DO was observed to increase from 5.0 to
10.0 mg l1 between July 14 and October 16, exceeding 8 mg l1
by September 25.
After the diffuser was turned off, the DO below 338.3 m
elevation (3 m above the bottom) rapidly dropped below
5.0 mg l1, as shown in Fig. 6. During the month-long shutdown
period, total Mn increased in the lower hypolimnion (3 m above
the bottom) while total Mn decreased in the upper hypolimnion
(6 and 9 m above the bottom), as shown in Fig. 6. More impor-
tantly, bottom DO was observed to decrease to less than
1.0 mg l1 (see Fig. 5). A mass balance on total Mn in the upper
hypolimnion reveals that total Mn in this region decreased by
approximately 700 kg during this month-long period, with
a corresponding increase of 880 kg in the lower hypolimnion
and benthic water. Correspondingly, soluble Mn concentrations
in the lower hypolimnion were also observed to increase rapidly
in conjunction with the substantially depleted DO observed at
this depth, which is believed to becausedby transport of soluble
Mn from the benthic (near-sediment) region.

Within 10 days of restarting the oxygenation system, Mn
levels in all regions (upper and lower) of the hypolimnion were
almost completely homogeneous, as shown in Fig. 6 where the
Mn concentrations at the three bulk hypolimnion elevations
converge. This relative homogeneity in the bulk hypolimnion
Mn concentration was observed at all times when the diffuser
was in operation and is evident in both Fig. 4 (soluble Mn) and
Fig. 6 (total Mn). Surprisingly, despite increasing and main-
taining the volume-averaged hypolimnion DO above 5 mg l1
after the oxygenation system was turned back on, soluble Mn
concentrations continued to increase. It could be argued that
the benthic region continued to be a source to the bulk
hypolimnion; however, a mass balance suggests that insufﬁ-
cient Mn mass was available in the benthic region to serve as
a continuous source to the upper waters. Therefore, the
observed increase is most likely due to transport of Mn from
elevations in the upper hypolimnion that are in contact with
hypoxic sediments further away from the deeper basin. This
idea will be addressed more thoroughly in a subsequent
section of this paper.
Soluble Mn concentrations remained high in the hypo-
limnion and did not begin to decrease until the volume-
averaged
hypolimnion
DO
was
nearly
7 mg l1,
which
occurred more than a month after oxygenation system oper-
ation was restored. While this may be attributed to the slow
oxidation kinetics of Mn, at the pH of w8 typically observed in
the hypolimnion, it is unlikely that chemical oxidation is the
sole cause of Mn oxidation. Furthermore, in addition to the
slow temporal response of Mn to oxygenation, it is interesting
to note that the observed decrease in soluble Mn coincided
with the time when organic detritus from the metalimnion
entered the hypolimnion following summer algal growth.
Increased organic loading in the hypolimnion is supported by
(1) elimination of the metalimnetic minimum (Gantzer et al.,
in press), as shown in Fig. 7 and (2) increased sediment loading
in sediment traps, where increased sedimentation rates of Fe,
Mn, TOC, and total solids were observed during this period
(total solids accumulation shown in Fig. 6). This suggests that
Mn oxidation in the hypolimnion may have been accelerated
by an increase in the amount of organic matter in the presence
of a well-oxygenated environment, as observed by other
researchers (Wann et al., 1997; Schoemann et al., 1998; Zaw
and Chiswell, 1999).
By October, soluble Mn concentrations in the bulk hypo-
limnion and in the benthic region decreased substantially at
all locations in the reservoir. This decrease coincided with an
increase in soluble Mn, reaching levels in excess of 36 mg l1
(Fig. 8), immediately below the sediment–water interface, as
observed from porewater measurements obtained at Location
CC. It is clear that oxidation and precipitation of Mn occurred
throughout
the
bulk
hypolimnion
and
benthic
region.
However, once the Mn precipitate was deposited on the
sediment together with the newly deposited organic matter, it
was likely resolubilized due to organic remineralization and
microbial reduction under the highly reducing sediment
environment, resulting in the increased levels of Mn observed
immediately below the sediment–water interface. Interest-
ingly, the soluble Mn was not observed to ﬂux back into the
overlying waters. At Location CC, where Mn porewater
samples were collected, it appears that the oxic/anoxic
boundary remained within the sediment (diffuser operations
apparently promoted DO penetration into the sediment), thus
limiting the mobility of soluble Mn into the water column. The
predicted location of the oxic/anoxic boundary is supported in
Fig. 5, which shows the volume-averaged hypolimnion DO in
excess of 10.0 mg l1 and DO in the bottom water directly over
the sediments >7.0 mg l1.

Manganese observations in 2007
A comparison of 2006 and 2007 results in Fig. 7 shows that
both soluble and particulate Mn levels in the bulk hypolim-
nion were substantially lower in 2007, despite similar Mn
concentrations in the benthic region (Fig. 4) for both years. The
main differences between 2006 and 2007 are (1) the oxygena-
tion system was turned off for 1 month in 2006, but was in

continuous operation during 2007 and (2) in 2007 DO levels in
the
bottom
water
and
in
the
bulk
hypolimnion
were
substantially higher (maintained at DO levels above 5 and
10.0 mg l1 through September, respectively, as shown in
Fig. 5). Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows Mn concentrations in the
upper
hypolimnion
were
somewhat
higher
than
those
observed in the lower hypolimnion in both 2006 and 2007.
These increased Mn levels in the upper hypolimnion are likely
due to Mn coming from locations where the upper hypolim-
nion water comes into contact with hypoxic sediments
further away from the deeper, oxygenated basin, a phenom-
enon described as horizontal transport by Schaller et al. (1997).
3.4.1.
Manganese in the benthic region and bulk hypolimnion
During the 2007 stratiﬁed period, soluble Mn in the bulk
hypolimnion remained low despite elevated Mn concentra-
tions in the benthic region. More importantly, Mn in the
sediment porewater was observed to be approximately ﬁve
times higher than in the benthic region, suggesting that Mn
was accumulating in the near-surface sediment (Bryant et al.,
in preparation). It appears that Mn continued to ﬂux from the
sediments to the benthic region, despite the elevated DO
observed in the bulk water and over the sediments. The
accumulation of Mn in the benthic region in 2007 was similar
to that observed in 2006 (see Fig. 4). The observed trend of Mn
ﬂux
from
the
sediment
occurring
independent
of
DO
concentration coincides with similar ﬁndings reported by
Pakhomova et al. (2007). It could be argued that Mn continued
to ﬂux from sediment porewater to the benthic region and
then ultimately to the bulk hypolimnion where it was then
diluted by the larger bulk volume or oxidized in the very high
DO conditions present in the bulk hypolimnion. In order for
this to occur, an assumption would have to be made that Mn
transport from the porewater to the benthic region and

subsequent loss to the overlying hypolimnion water were in
steady-state; thus, Mn levels in the porewater would need to
decrease while Mn levels in the hypolimnetic water increased.
However, this was not observed to be the case. Mn levels in the
porewater actually continued to increase throughout the
summer from 9.6 mg l1 in April to 42.0 mg l1 in early October
(Bryant et al., in preparation) while soluble Mn levels in the
bulk hypolimnion remained relatively constant. A similar
trend was observed in 2006, as shown in Fig. 8. It is hypothe-
sized that the decreased Mn concentrations observed in the
bulk hypolimnion during the 2007 summer stratiﬁed period
were a result of the oxygenation system more efﬁciently
increasing DO and turbulence near the sediment surface, thus
keeping the oxic/anoxic boundary closer to the sediment–
water interface over a greater surface area than in 2006 (Fig. 5).
Therefore, it is possible that soluble Mn was oxidized as it
passed through the benthic region and re-precipitated back to
the sediment (forming a Mn redox cycle in the benthic region;
Zhang et al., 1999). This suppression of soluble Mn to the
benthic region during 2007 is supported by the observation
that the proportion of soluble Mn relative to total Mn was
lower during the 2007 stratiﬁed period than during 2006; thus,
a greater percentage of the total Mn in the reservoir system
was in the oxidized form.
As observed in 2006, an increase in soluble Mn in the
benthic region did not occur until June. The delayed increase
is believed to be caused by the location of the oxic/anoxic
boundary remaining below the sediment–water interface
prior to June (thus inhibiting diffusion of soluble Mn out of the
sediment) and shifting upwards into the benthic region after
June (as indicated by CTD proﬁles and microsensor measure-
ments obtained by Bryant et al., in preparation), which is
supported by the ﬁndings of Balzer (1982), Koretsky et al.
(2006), and Katsev et al. (2007). Between April and June, DO
concentrations were elevated (>8 mg l1) throughout the
reservoir, including in the benthic region (Fig. 5). Microsensor
DO proﬁles indicated increased DO penetration during this
period at all locations, with DO penetration ranging between 2
and 4 mm at C3, the sampling location farthest from the
diffuser. As the summer progressed, decreased DO was
observed near the reservoir bottom (Fig. 5), suggesting that the
oxic/anoxic boundary shifted upward, closer to or slightly
above the sediment–water interface. Despite elevated Mn
concentrations in the benthic region, average Mn concentra-
tions in the bulk hypolimnion were observed to be substan-
tially lower (97%) in 2007 (0.02 mg l1) than historically
observed between 2000 and 2005 (0.6 mg l1).
As observed in 2006, total Mn increased in the bulk hypo-
limnion during October 2007, although not to the same extent.
Total Mn concentrations again decreased as the metalimnetic
minimum was eliminated, suggesting accelerated removal
due to adsorption and/or co-precipitation of Mn with organic
detritus, as the organics settled through the hypolimnion to
the sediment.
3.4.2.
Horizontal transport
Manganese concentrations were observed to be higher in the
upper hypolimnion than in the lower hypolimnion in both
2006 and 2007 (Fig. 3), which, as mentioned previously, may be
attributed to horizontal transport from hypoxic regions up-
reservoir from the oxygenated, deeper reservoir basin. To
further illustrate this phenomenon, the mass of Mn at each
elevation in the hypolimnion (bottom (benthic) region, lower
hypolimnion (3 m above sediment), and upper hypolimnion
(6 and 9 m above sediment)) was calculated for 2006. Based on
enhanced levels of Mn at the bottom during the period when
the diffuser was turned off, these results indicate that Mn
present at the benthic elevation can reasonably be assumed to
be the source of Mn to the overlying water (Fig. 9). Once the
diffuser was turned back on, the mass of Mn in the benthic
region (335.3 m) was observed to be signiﬁcantly lower than in
the upper hypolimnion (341.4 and 344.4-m elevation). The
increased mass of Mn 9 m above the bottom far exceeded that
present 3 m above the bottom or in the benthic region. The Mn
levels observed in the upper hypolimnion therefore appear to
come from a soluble Mn source speciﬁc to this higher eleva-
tion, presumably where the hypolimnetic water comes into
contact with hypoxic, reducing sediments. The Mn peak
observed in the middle of the water column (Fig. 9) resembles
results presented in other studies describing lateral transport
from shallower, more hypoxic sediments ( Schaller et al., 1997;
Wann et al., 1997).
In 2007, to further examine the horizontal transport theory,
soluble Mn concentrations were measured at two locations
spaced approximately 1500 m apart (CC, in the immediate
vicinity of the diffuser, and C3, 1500 m up-reservoir from the
diffuser, as shown in Fig. 1), but at equivalent depths (341.4 m
elevation) in the water column. This sample depth was 6.2 m
above the sediments at CC and within 0.3 m of the sediments
at C3, due to up-sloping reservoir bottom topography from CC
to C3. Manganese concentrations at C3 were only slightly
higher than at CC until mid-July, when they were then
observed to increase markedly (Fig. 10). This Mn increase
coincided with a decreased applied gas ﬂow rate to the
diffuser; thus, less DO was being supplied to the reservoir.
Consequently, DO in the lower hypolimnion at C3 decreased
from 10.2 to 3.9 mg l1 between July 17 and October 12,
although it did not reach complete anoxia. The impact of the
diffuser, in terms of induced mixing and elevated DO
concentrations,
is
logically
observed
to
decrease

increasing distance up-reservoir from the diffuser location in

region in 2007 suggests that anoxic conditions would be
present at the sediment–water interface even further up-
reservoir, thus promoting the diffusion of soluble, reduced Mn
from the sediment to the overlying waters at these remote
locations not affected by oxygenation.

Conclusions
Oxygenation increased DO concentrations throughout the
hypolimnion and down to the sediment–water interface,
although DO levels were not uniformly maintained in the bulk
hypolimnion or along the reservoir bottom. Oxygenation also
induced less mixing than is typically observed during natural
mixing in the winter. While decreased mixing results in
reduced DO penetration into the sediment, diffuser-induced
mixing does appear to maintain the oxic/anoxic boundary at
a depth sufﬁcient to restrict substantial ﬂux of soluble Mn to
the bulk hypolimnion. Major conclusions for this research on
a full-scale application of hypolimnetic oxygenation to control
Mn in source water are
1. Maintaining DO in the bulk hypolimnion (8–10 mg l1)
coupled
with
elevated
DO
conditions
at
the
bottom
(6–8 mg l1) was ineffective in preventing soluble Mn ﬂux
from the sediments to the overlying bottom (benthic) water.
2. Hypolimnetic oxygenation did not establish DO or turbu-
lent conditions at the sediment–water interface equal to
those commonly observed during completely mixed winter
conditions. This in turn prevents the oxic/anoxic boundary
from being universally positioned below the sediment–water
interface, leading to potentially anoxic conditions up-
reservoir from the location of the diffusers.
3. The relative position of the oxic/anoxic boundary during
periods of oxygenation appeared to be close enough to the
sediment to prevent transport of soluble Mn from the
bottom (benthic) waters to the bulk hypolimnion, thus
promoting Mn oxidation in the benthic region and subse-
quent cycling back to the sediment.
4. Horizontal transport is a signiﬁcant source of soluble Mn to
the upper hypolimnion during summer as the oxic/anoxic
boundary moves into the water column up-reservoir.
5. Hypolimnetic
oxygenation
successfully
reduced
bulk
hypolimnion Mn levels by 97%, resulting in volume-aver-
aged
soluble
Mn
concentrations
of
approximately
0.02 mg l1 in the hypolimnion.
We conclude that Mn control in source water is more
complicated than previously understood, and is affected by
a combination of factors including DO concentrations, hypo-
limnetic mixing, and sedimentation of organic matter, high-
lighting
the
need
for
continued
research.
Despite
the
complexities associated with Mn oxidation, levels of reduced,
soluble Mn in the bulk hypolimnion were observed to decrease
substantially due to elevated hypolimnetic DO and suppres-
sion of the oxic/anoxic boundary closer to the sediment.
Hypolimnetic oxygenation was thus shown to be a viable
method of improving drinking water quality by decreasing
levels of soluble Fe and Mn in the source water.

Abstract
Seiche-induced turbulence and the vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen above and within the sediment were
analyzed to evaluate the sediment oxygen uptake rate (JO2), diffusive boundary layer thickness (dDBL), and
sediment oxic zone depth (zmax) in situ. High temporal-resolution microprofiles across the sediment–water
interface and current velocity data within the bottom boundary layer in a medium-sized mesotrophic lake were
obtained during a 12-h field study. We resolved the dynamic forcing of a full 8-h seiche cycle and evaluated JO2
from both sides of the sediment–water interface. Turbulence (characterized by the energy dissipation rate, e), the
vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen across the sediment–water interface (characterized by dDBL and zmax),
JO2, and the sediment oxygen consumption rate (RO2) are all strongly correlated in our freshwater system. Seiche-
induced turbulence shifted from relatively active (e 5 1.2 3 1028 W kg21) to inactive (e 5 7.8 3 10212 W kg21). In
response to this dynamic forcing, dDBL increased from 1.0 mm to the point of becoming undefined, zmax decreased
from 2.2 to 0.3 mm as oxygen was depleted from the sediment, and JO2 decreased from 7.0 to 1.1 mmol m22 d21
over a time span of hours. JO2 and oxygen consumption were found to be almost equivalent (within , 5% and
thus close to steady state), with RO2 adjusting rapidly to changes in JO2. Our results reveal the transient nature of
sediment oxygen uptake and the importance of accurately characterizing turbulence when estimating JO2.
Dissolved oxygen (O2) is one of the most critical
ecological parameters affecting natural aquatic systems with
benthic diversity, ecosystem health, and overall water quality
all negatively influenced by depleted O2 levels (Wetzel 2001;
Stachowitsch et al. 2007). The amount of O2 taken up by the
sediment largely governs O2 depletion in stratified waters
with organic-rich sediment (Bouldin 1968; Veenstra and
Nolen 1991). Sediment O2 uptake is a function of both
physical limitations on O2 transfer to the sediment and
sediment O2 consumption processes (Jørgensen and Bou-
dreau 2001). Resolving the vertical distribution of O2 at the
sediment–water interface (SWI) allows for the quantification
of the sediment O2 uptake flux (JO2), which is a fundamental
parameter for the characterization of O2 dynamics in aquatic
systems (Wetzel 2001). Consequently, considerable effort
has been devoted to elucidating the water-side and sediment-
side factors controlling sediment O2 uptake in freshwater
and marine systems (Bouldin 1968; Jørgensen and Revsbech
1985; Boudreau 2001).
Molecular diffusion typically becomes the controlling
transport process for dissolved species (e.g., O2) at
approximately 1 mm above the SWI in nonadvective
systems (e.g., cohesive freshwater and marine sediment;
Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985; Røy et al. 2004). This
millimeter-scale region immediately above the SWI is
referred to as the diffusive boundary layer (DBL; Jørgensen
and Revsbech 1985). Diffusion through the DBL is often
the rate-limiting step restricting the supply of O2 to the
sediment in systems (e.g., lakes) where steep gradients occur
at the SWI (Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985; Wu¨est and
Lorke 2003). O2 transport to the SWI is driven by the
concentration gradient in the DBL and is therefore a
function of the thickness of the DBL (dDBL), which is
controlled by turbulent mixing in the bottom boundary
layer (BBL), and O2 concentrations within the bulk BBL
(Cbulk) and at the SWI (CSWI), as depicted in Fig. 1. Upon
reaching the sediment, O2 is used for various biogeochem-
ical processes (e.g., benthic organic matter mineralization
and oxidation of reduced compounds) within the sediment
oxic zone (quantified by depth zmax; Fig. 1). A balance
between the rate at which O2 is supplied to the sediment,
quantified by flux JO2 (mmol m22 d21), and the rate at
which O2 is consumed within the sediment, quantified by
the O2 consumption rate (RO2), which may be defined
volumetrically (RO2v; mmol m23 d21) or areally (RO2a;
mmol m22 d21), establishes the extent of the sediment oxic
zone (Jørgensen and Boudreau 2001; Higashino et al.
2004). It is important to note that RO2 describes the use of
available O2 supplied to the sediment rather than the
potential sediment O2 demand (PSOD), which is often
evaluated as a constant volumetric O2 consumption rate.
PSOD is a function of available electron acceptors in the
sediment. While RO2v may approach PSOD in systems
where RO2v controls O2 diffusion at the SWI (e.g., marine
sediment), PSOD would be much greater than RO2v in
highly organic, transport-limited systems (e.g., lake sedi-

ment; Wu¨est and Lorke 2003). Furthermore, while RO2v
may be strongly influenced by JO2, PSOD is a relatively
inherent property unaffected by short-term variations in O2
availability.
Turbulence in the BBL (e.g., due to internal currents
forced by wind or tide) has a direct effect on O2 transport
to the sediment and thus also influences O2 consumption
processes within the sediment. Significant insight has been
gained from theoretical studies on how turbulence-induced
variations in dDBL affect O2 uptake (Higashino et al. 2004,
2008), the relative contributions of O2-consuming processes
(Glud et al. 2007; Brand et al. 2009), and sediment
microbial activity (Gantzer and Stefan 2003; Higashino
and Stefan 2005). Rapid changes in dDBL in response to
dynamic forcing have been observed both in the laboratory
(Mackenthun and Stefan 1998; Røy et al. 2004; O’Connor
and Hondzo 2008) and in situ (Gundersen and Jørgensen
1990; Lorke et al. 2003). Glud et al. (2009) document that
the vertical distribution of O2 at the SWI of marine
sediment can vary temporally (on the order of minutes to
hours) by a factor . 3, which is within the range of
seasonal variability for many aquatic systems. Results of
these studies highlight the importance of using multiple
measurements to resolve average conditions at the SWI.
However, isolated measurements evaluating JO2 under
conditions assumed constant are sometimes extrapolated
to characterize an aquatic system, thereby ignoring the
influence of intermittent hydrodynamic processes (Veenstra
and Nolen 1991; Beutel 2003).
Despite the established relationship between turbulence
and the vertical O2 distribution near the SWI, relatively few
studies have incorporated simultaneous measurements of in
situ current velocity and dDBL into the assessment of JO2.
Previous work has focused predominantly on marine systems
(Gundersen and Jørgensen 1990; Glud et al. 2007). Several
freshwater experiments were performed to resolve turbulent
O2 transport within the BBL (Brand et al. 2008) and the effect
of BBL dynamics on dDBL (Lorke et al. 2003); however, these
studies primarily characterized turbulence. To our knowledge,
no in situ work has been done that focuses on how JO2, dDBL,
and the sediment oxic zone vary in response to rapid changes
in velocity and direction of basin-scale (i.e., seiche) currents.
Additionally, while sediment O2 uptake may be influenced by
both hydrodynamics and consumption processes within the
sediment (Fig. 1), JO2 is almost always interpreted exclusively
from either a water- or sediment-side perspective (Higashino
et al. 2004). We performed an in situ study that evaluated data
from the water and sediment side of the SWI to determine
how seiche-induced turbulence affects dDBL, the sediment oxic
zone, and corresponding JO2 and RO2 on a rapid (subhourly)
timescale. This research is therefore unique in that it assesses
the transient nature of sediment O2 uptake by investigating
the effect of seiche-induced dynamic forcing on the vertical O2
distribution under natural, in situ conditions from both sides
of the SWI.
Methods
Study site and in situ instrumentation—We performed a
12-h field campaign (21:00 h on 27 August to 09:00 h on 28
August 2007) to obtain high-resolution SWI profile data
(O2 and temperature) and velocity data in Lake Alpnach,
Switzerland. Lake Alpnach has a simple elliptical shape, a
well-established deep current structure, and mesotrophic
production (Wu¨est et al. 2000). The lake is characterized
by a relatively high JO2 (ranging annually from , 10 to
, 20 mmol m22 d21) and a shallow sediment oxic zone
(, 3 mm) that establish steep O2 gradients at the SWI
(Mu¨ller et al. 2002; Lorke et al. 2003). Alpine mountain
ridges direct thermal winds over the lake causing basin-
scale movements of the waterbody. Two seiche modes are
typically observed in summer: a first horizontal–first
vertical mode with a period of 8 to 12 h and a first
horizontal–second vertical mode with a period of , 24 h
(Mu¨nnich et al. 1992; Lorke et al. 2003). The dynamic O2
conditions at the SWI and daily wind forcing make Lake
Alpnach an ideal location for this study.
During the campaign, an instrumentation array was
deployed on the southwestern slope of Lake Alpnach
(46u579210N, 8u179530E) at a depth of 22 m. Velocity data
were collected continuously at a single point using an acoustic
Doppler velocimeter (ADV; Vector, Nortek) and as vertical
profiles using an acoustic Doppler profiler (ADP; Aquadopp,
Nortek). Thermistors (TR-1060, RBR Ltd.) were placed on
the ADP tripod to resolve the temperature structure. A
microprofiler (MP4, Unisense A/S) was used to measure high-
resolution O2 and temperature profiles across the SWI. A
conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD; SBE-19, Seabird
Electronics) profiler, which also measured O2, was used to
profile the water column near the experiment site every 2 h for
background information on O2 and density stratification.
Detailed information about the primary components of the
experimental setup is provided below. Frequently used
acronyms and notations are defined in Table 1.
ADV velocity measurements—An ADV was used to
continuously measure three-dimensional current time series
Fig. 1.
The key components of a dissolved oxygen (O2)
profile are defined, illustrating the relationship between seiching,
turbulent mixing, and the vertical distribution of O2 on both sides
of the sediment–water interface (SWI; modified from Jørgensen
and Revsbech 1985). Water-side components include the bottom
boundary layer (BBL), the diffusive boundary layer (of thickness
dDBL), and O2 concentrations in the BBL (Cbulk) and at the SWI
(CSWI). On the sediment side, zmax is the depth of the sediment
oxic zone.

at 32 Hz, positioned via tripod at 10 cm above the SWI.
Accuracy of the velocity measurements is 0.5% of measured
value 60.1 cm s21. ADV velocity data were used to analyze
the current structure and to estimate energy dissipation rate
and friction velocity at 10 cm above the SWI.
ADP velocity measurements—A 2-MHz ADP equipped
with three acoustic beams slanted at 25u was used to
measure BBL current profiles. Accuracy of the velocity
measurements is 1% of measured value 60.5 cm s21. The
ADP was positioned (via tripod) downward looking and
measured profiles from 1.60 m to 0 m above the sediment,
with 32 measurement cells (5-cm bin size). Samples were
obtained in burst mode with 1024 samples per ensemble at
a rate of 8 Hz. ADP velocity data were used to estimate
bottom drag coefficients at 1 m above the SWI as an
independent verification of ADV velocity data.
O2 and temperature logger measurements—BBL temper-
ature (i.e., density) structure was continuously measured
using a string of 20 thermistors positioned every 25 cm on
the leg of the ADP tripod, from 0 m to 4.75 m above the
sediment. Measurements were obtained using TR-1060
thermistors, which have a response time of , 3 s, accuracy
of 62 3 1023 uC, resolution of , 5 3 1025 uC, and drift of
, 2 3 1023 uC yr21. A logger measuring both temperature
and O2 (TDO-2050, RBR Ltd.) was mounted on the
microprofiler at 8 cm above the sediment. In addition to
TR-1060 temperature specifications, the TDO-2050 has a
measurement range of 0% to 150% O2 saturation, with an
accuracy of 61%. TDO-2050 O2 data were calibrated via
Winkler titration of BBL water sampled at the same depth
using a Niskin bottle. The calibrated TDO time series and a
zero reading from anoxic sediment were then used for
calibration of microprofiler O2 measurements.
Microsensor
O2
and
temperature
measurements
across SWI—An in situ autonomous microprofiler
equipped with microsensors (one Clark-type O2 sensor
and one thermocoupled temperature sensor, Unisense A/S)
was used for microprofiling across the SWI. The sensors
have tip diameters of 100 mm, which allow for fast
response time (90% in , 8 s), negligible stirring sensitivity,
and , 100-mm spatial resolution. Vertical alignment of the
microsensors was established by lowering the group of
microsensors toward quiescent water and adjusting sensors
until all tips touched the water surface simultaneously.
Profiles were obtained every , 50 min and were acquired
as follows: 10-mm resolution from 10 cm to 1 cm above
the SWI, 1-mm resolution from 1 cm to 0.5 cm above the
SWI, 0.1-mm resolution from 0.5 cm above to 0.5 cm
below the SWI. Following a brief pause to establish
equilibrium, ten data points were collected at each depth
at a rate of 1 Hz (inspection of measurement set showed
no trend in variation, thus confirming data aliasing did
not occur).
We measured 14 O2 profiles during the experiment. The
O2 profile number (1–14) corresponds to the time each
profile was obtained and is used as a reference for
comparison with other parameters (e.g., turbulence). In
the absence of a video camera, the location of the SWI was
determined by both visual interpretation of each profile
(based on identifying linear DBL regions and kinks in the
profiles due to porosity differences between the sediment
and the water column; Røy et al. 2004) and using standard
deviations of O2 profile data (variation should decrease
approaching the SWI due to reduced fluctuations in
turbulence; Mu¨ller et al. 2002; Brand et al. 2007). Estimates
of the SWI using O2 standard deviations were comparable
to estimates based on visual interpretation, though
consistently , 1 mm deeper. Correspondingly, previous
work has shown the variance method to systematically
overestimate dDBL due to concentration fluctuations
protruding into the sediment (Røy et al. 2004). The SWI
location predicted by both methods did remain relatively
constant across our profile series, however. Hence, even if
the estimated SWI location was slightly erroneous, this
would not affect comparison among profiles.
O2 uptake and DBL analyses—O2 uptake is frequently
evaluated for cohesive sediment using a water-side ap-
proach based on Fick’s first law of diffusion (Rasmussen

where D is the molecular diffusion coefficient for O2 in
water (m2 d21), Q is porosity (m3 voids m23 total volume;
taken as unity in the water column), and hC/hz is the linear
O2 concentration gradient in the DBL immediately above
the SWI (i.e., the change in the O2 concentration, C, over
distance z; mmol m24).
While this is one of the most direct approaches for
evaluating JO2, there are several problems associated with
quantifying dDBL. The short residence time of O2 near the
SWI and rapid variations in dDBL due to BBL turbulence
make it difficult to accurately characterize the DBL with
microsensor measurements (Røy et al. 2004; O’Connor and
Hondzo 2008). Furthermore, the transition from the linear
DBL to the bulk BBL region is often indistinct (Wu¨est and
Lorke 2003). To address this issue, Jørgensen and Revsbech
(1985) established an ‘‘effective’’ DBL, obtained by
extrapolating hC/hz at the SWI to the point where O2
levels reach the average concentration of the BBL (Cbulk;
Fig. 1) as defined by the second part of Eq. 1 (on the right-
hand side). It has been shown, however, that dDBL is often
overestimated by the effective DBL (Hondzo et al. 2005;
O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). Additionally, microsensors
have been found to alter the structure of the DBL by , 25–
45%, possibly due to increased flow around the micro-
sensor shaft compressing the DBL below the sensor tip
(Glud et al. 1994; Glud 2008). A decreased dDBL caused by
microsensor compression would obviously result in an
overestimation of JO2. Considering the variability of the
DBL and subsequent difficulties in characterizing dDBL, it
may be more appropriate to regard dDBL as a conceptual
parameter rather than as a physical quantity.
Although problems with quantifying dDBL are avoided
when using sediment-side methods, these methods are often
more intensive due to relatively complex sediment process-
es. In addition to accounting for Q effects (Eq. 1), changes
in O2 consumption and storage in the sediment must also
be accurately quantified. The balance between the amount

where volumetric RO2v (mmol m23 d21) and the change in O2
concentration over time (hC/htv; mmol m23 d21) are
integrated over the sediment profile to zmax (designated in
this study as the depth where O2 , 3 mmol L21). The first
term on the right-hand side of Eq. 2 represents the amount of
O2 consumed per unit of time, while the second term
represents the temporal change of the O2 content in the
sediment (Higashino et al. 2004). Depth-integrated values
from Eq. 2 are defined by areal RO2a and hC/hta, respectively
(mmol m22 d21; Table 1), for each profile to allow for direct
comparison with JO2. Equation 2 shows that JO2 and RO2a
are equal at steady state, whereas O2 accumulation or
depletion (hC/hta) occurs during transient conditions.
To comprehensively assess how dynamic forcing affects
sediment O2 uptake, we analyzed JO2 and dDBL for each O2
microsensor profile with five different methods that
incorporated data from both the water side (direct and u*
methods) and sediment side (curvefit, zonefit, and model
methods) of the SWI. These five methods were selected to
evaluate JO2 using O2 microsensor and velocity data.
Problems with specific measurement techniques (e.g.,
measuring dDBL) or analytical methods should be mini-
mized by the use of a combination of methods based on
water-side velocities and water- and sediment-side micro-
sensor data. A more detailed comparison of the methods
used to estimate sediment O2 uptake will be presented in a
companion paper (L. Bryant unpubl. data).
For the direct method, hC/hz was obtained directly from
the DBL region of O2 microsensor profiles and then
incorporated into Eq. 1 to evaluate dDBL and JO2 (Jørgensen
and Revsbech 1985). For the u* method (Hondzo et al.
2005), dimensionless power law scaling was applied to
friction velocity (u*) data derived from ADV velocity series
to universally scale the vertical O2 distribution in the BBL
for dDBL, which was then used to solve for JO2 via Eq. 1.
O2 profile data from the sediment side were evaluated by
fitting a polynomial equation C(z) to the porewater region of
each O2 profile, focusing on the region immediately below
the SWI (curvefit method). The derivative of C(z) was then
incorporated into Eq. 1 to solve for JO2 and dDBL (Glud
2008). Third-order C(z) polynomial equations were found to
best fit the series of profile data, with the exception of profile
6, which required a fourth-order polynomial.
Porewater data were also evaluated using the numerical
model PROFILE (Berg et al. 1998), which analyzes data
based on a numerical analysis that defines multiple zones of
constant consumption to best describe each O2 profile
(zonefit method). Integrating depth-specific RO2v (evaluated
at 0.1-mm increments) over the depth of the sediment oxic
zone yields the overall areal RO2a per profile. RO2a can then
be used to calculate JO2 via Eq. 2. Model parameters used
include D 5 1.97 3 1029 m2 s21 at 20uC (corrected for
temperature using the Stokes–Einstein relationship; Li and
Gregory 1974; Agrega and Lee 2005), with irrigation and
bioturbation effects assumed negligible and boundary
conditions (evaluated at the bottom of each profile) of
JO2 5 0 mmol m22 d21 and C 5 0 mmol L21.
We further analyzed sediment porewater data with the
sediment module of the aquatic system simulation software
AQUASIM (Reichert 1994), which was used to predict the
dDBL required to model O2 porewater profiles via a simple
Monod model for O2 consumption (model method). Model
parameters and setup details for the AQUASIM model
used in this study are defined by Brand et al. (2009). We
were able to accurately model our series of sediment O2
profiles in AQUASIM with a single set of Monod
parameters (maximum oxidation rate (m) 5 5920 mmol
m23 d21 and half-saturation constant (KO2) 5 19.1 mmol
L21) and CSWI as the only variable. We then incorporated
these Monod parameters into a second model (see Eq. 6 in
Brand et al. 2009) in which Cbulk was designated as the
Seiche forcing of sediment oxygen uptake
953

upper boundary condition and dDBL was used as the sole
fitting parameter to reproduce our sediment O2 profiles.
Sediment cores from our experiment site were analyzed
for Q (porewater volume per total volume) following
Dalsgaard et al. (2000) to characterize diffusive transport
in the sediment, and Q values of 0.97 and 0.91 in the upper
5 mm were obtained. Using these Q results as a point of
reference and JO2 values from an independent set of profiles
(obtained , 1 m from our experiment site, measured prior
to the series of 14 assessed in the primary study) as goals, Q
was also estimated on a millimeter scale with PROFILE
(which uses Q as an input parameter) via a trial-and-error
approach. Similar porosities (0.95 in the upper 1 mm of
sediment and 0.90 below) were obtained, and these Q values
were used in Eq. 1 and/or as model parameters.
The transience of our system and sediment O2 consump-
tion as a function of O2 availability were evaluated using
Eq. 2. Proximity to steady state was determined by
calculating hC/hta for each profile by comparing the
preceding and following profiles, evaluating hC/htv at each
depth, and integrating over zmax. Because the direct, u*,
curvefit, and model methods estimate JO2 directly, results
from these methods were used to evaluate O2 consumption
(as characterized by RO2a) via Eq. 2 as a function of hC/hta.
The zonefit method predicts depth-specific O2 consumption
directly, and hence Eq. 2 was used to estimate JO2 from
RO2a values based on PROFILE results.
Using results of the five methods, mean values of JO2,
RO2a, and dDBL were calculated for each profile. These
parameters were statistically analyzed based on a normal
distribution. Standard deviations (s) were calculated for
JO2 and dDBL data (s calculations for RO2a were unneces-
sary since JO2 and RO2a are directly correlated via Eq. 2).
Estimates obtained from the five methods were compara-
ble, as shown below.
Inertial dissipation analyses—The dissipation rate of
turbulent kinetic energy, e (W kg21), was estimated using
the inertial dissipation method (Grant et al. 1962). The
analysis is based on the inertial subrange where the
spectrum is expressed in the wave number (k) domain
E(k)~ae

ð3Þ
where velocity fluctuation follows a k25/3 slope for eddy
sizes of typically decimeters to meters (Fig. 2a). We used a
5 1.56 for the experimentally estimated, three-dimensional
Kolmogorov constant (Wyngaard and Cote´ 1971). With
the ADV, we measured horizontal (longitudinal and
lateral) and vertical velocity fluctuations 10 cm above the
sediment. Dissipation rates can be obtained from the
longitudinal component of the one-dimensional spectrum
expressed in the wave number (k1) domain

where a1 5 (18/55) a and a2 5 (4/3) a1. Rather than fitting
the 25/3 slope to the inertial subrange, the respective power
spectrum (Eqs. 4 and 5) is multiplied by k5/3. This
procedure transforms the spectrum so that it is only
dependent on e as E(k) 3 k5/3 becomes constant (Fig. 2a).
Dissipation (e) is then calculated by taking the average of
the inertial subrange. All three velocity fluctuation records
were used to quantify the value of e (longitudinal,
transversal planar, and transversal vertical; Eqs. 4 and 5)
over a time span of approximately 50 min (Fig. 2b), which
corresponds to the measurement period of each O2 profile.
To account for the intermittency of turbulence, e is
averaged by assuming a lognormal distribution (Baker and
Gibson 1987). The most likely average of the three e values
(e) is

where ln (e) is the average of the ln value of e and sln(e) is

(Table 2).
Friction velocity analyses—Friction velocities (u*) were
calculated at a height (h) of 10 cm above the sediment from
the estimated e values using the law-of-the-wall assumption

where k (the von Karman constant) is 0.41. The resulting u*

currents on the sediment and, thus, like e, describe the
level of turbulence in the BBL.
Results
Seiche dynamics—We acquired data for 12 h and
captured a full 8-h seiche cycle. During the campaign,
bottom currents moved initially from the southwest toward
the northeast, reached the current reversal point, and then
reversed direction toward the southwest, similar to the
motion of a pendulum (as depicted in Fig. 3a, where the
schematics show the waterbody moving back and forth
relative to our experiment site). Corresponding changes in
current velocity are shown in Fig. 3b. During the observed
seiche cycle, water from higher elevations in the BBL
moved down the southwestern slope with increasing
velocity toward the northeast. Current velocity reached a
maximum of 2.3 cm s21 (at 23:50 h) during this period. At
the current reversal point (, 04:00 h), velocities in the BBL
reached a minimum value of 0.6 cm s21. When the water
mass then shifted back toward the southwest, water from
the central region of the BBL moved toward the
southwestern slope and velocities increased to levels
observed prior to current reversal, reaching a maximum
value of 2.3 cm s21 (at 07:44 h).
Lorke et al. (2002) demonstrated that law-of-the-wall
theory (used to estimate u*) only applies in cases of
turbulence where longitudinal velocity is greater than
1 cm s21 at 1 m above the sediment. Most of our velocities
(obtained at 10 cm above the sediment) were within this
954
Bryant et al.

range, with only velocities during the period of current
reversal (profiles 7–9) falling significantly below this level
(Fig. 3b). Accordingly, a majority of our profiles were
consistent with the law-of-the-wall profile. However, for
velocities smaller than this threshold, the logarithmic
profile broke down and no characteristic features of the
BBL could be identified (as independently confirmed by O2
microsensor measurements). To verify the applicability of
the law-of-the-wall to the full series of our velocity data, we
employed the bottom drag coefficient (C1m) via
u~
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
C1m
p
U1m m s{1


ð8Þ
where U1m is the longitudinal velocity (m s21) at 1 m above
the sediment obtained from the downward-looking ADP.
The bottom drag coefficient relates the Reynolds stress on
the sediment surface and the mean current velocity at a
specified height. A C1m value of 0.0033 was obtained for
the full set of velocity data and a C1m of 0.0013 was
obtained when the velocity data below 1 cm s21 were
excluded. These C1m values are comparable to the typical
range of 0.001–0.003 (Wu¨est and Lorke 2003) for smooth-
bottom boundaries (such as lake bottom sediments).
Temperature and O2 distribution—Temperature and O2
in the water column and near the sediment are shown to be
strongly affected by seiche-induced variations in current
velocity (Figs. 3, 4). At the beginning of the measurement
period (21:00 h), a cold water mass from the central, well-
mixed BBL moved across the experiment site (Fig. 4a–c).
As the water mass shifted toward the northeast, warmer
water from the upper BBL moved toward the experiment
site (approaching 04:00 h) as the current reversal point was
approached (Fig. 3). Following reversal of current direc-
tion, velocity increased and the cooler, well-mixed region of
the BBL moved back to the experiment site as the current
shifted the water mass toward the southwest.
Variations in temperature and O2 in the BBL at 8 cm
above the sediment are shown in Fig. 4a. Changes in
temperature are shown as a function of depth in Fig. 4b
(200 to 30 cm above the SWI) and Fig. 4c (1 cm above to
0.25 cm below the SWI). From Fig. 4b,c, it is apparent that
while temperature varied over time (on the order of , 2uC),
the vertical temperature profile remained relatively con-
stant with depth but was displaced first in the positive and
then negative direction. However, while changes in O2 are
relatively minor (on the order of , 10 mmol L21) at 8 cm
above the sediment (Fig. 4a), O2 variations are observed on
a much greater scale near the SWI (Fig. 4d; 1 cm above to
0.25 cm below the SWI). When velocity decreased during
profiles 5 to 9, O2 decreased from , 100 mmol L21 to
70 mmol L21 at 1 cm above the SWI and from 59 mmol L21
to 5 mmol L21 at the SWI. Furthermore, the sediment
approached anoxia as sediment O2 was depleted during this
period.
The controlling influence that dynamic forcing has on
the vertical distribution of O2 above and below the SWI is
emphasized in Fig. 5. O2 profiles are separated into panels
according to the direction of profile movement, which
strongly corresponds to changes in velocity magnitude. The
oscillating motion of the waterbody is apparent in the
directional shifts of the O2 profiles over the seiche cycle. As
currents intensify, O2 levels in the water and in the sediment
increase, as shown by profiles 2–5 (Fig. 5a) and 9–14
(Fig. 5c); however, as velocity decreases approaching
current reversal, O2 throughout the full length of the
profile drops to negligible levels (profiles 5–9; Fig. 5b).
Profile 1 is not shown due to a slight misalignment with the
other profiles that likely resulted from equipment settling
into the sediment following deployment (discussed further
below). A key point shown in Fig. 5 is the elasticity of the
system, in that the vertical O2 distribution changes
significantly as it shifts from oxic (Fig. 5a) to nearly anoxic
conditions (Fig. 5b), but then it returns to an oxic
distribution (Fig. 5c) as it was in its initial state (Fig. 5a).

Seiche forcing of sediment oxygen uptake
955

In Fig. 5a (profiles 2–5) and Fig. 5c (profiles 9–14), the
oxic zone extends further into the sediment and dDBL
decreases as velocity increases, clearly illustrating how
current-induced mixing forces the vertical O2 structure at
the SWI. After velocity peaked at approximately 23:50 h
(Fig. 5a), zmax and CSWI reached maximum values (2.2 mm
and 59 mmol L21, respectively), while dDBL reached a
minimum of 1.0 mm. This relationship is shown in reverse
in Fig. 5b (profiles 5–9) where, as velocity decreases during
current reversal (between profiles 8 and 9 at approximately
04:00 h), dDBL increases to the point of being undefined,
and the oxic zone almost completely disappears (minimum
zmax 5 0.3 mm) as the sediment goes anoxic.
O2 flux and dDBL—Mean values of JO2 and dDBL were
obtained by averaging results from the five analytical
methods used to evaluate O2 profile and u* data (Table 3).
Consequently, both water-side (transport) and sediment-
side (consumption) influences on JO2 and dDBL are reflected
in the average values. Values of JO2 based on RO2a from the
zonefit model were corrected for transient accumulation of
O2 per Eq. 2. During energetic periods (maximum e 5 1.2
3 1028 W kg21; profile 4), dDBL reached a minimum of
1.0
mm
and
JO2
increased
to
a
maximum
of
7.0 mmol m22 d21 (Table 3). As turbulence decreased
approaching the current reversal point (minimum e 5 7.8 3
10212 W kg21; profile 9), dDBL expanded significantly, since
there was no longer sufficient turbulence to maintain an
established DBL (Fig. 5; Table 3). Although a DBL in the
classical sense is not maintained under these quiescent
conditions (Gantzer and Stefan 2003; Røy et al. 2004), we
nevertheless quantified dDBL during this period as a relative
measure for comparison. Using independent results from
all five methods, a maximum average dDBL of 7.8 6 2.2 mm
was estimated for profile 9 (Table 3).
During the period of weak turbulence and subsequently
increased dDBL, JO2 decreased by85%, from 7.0mmol m22 d21
to 1.1 mmol m22 d21 (Fig. 6). The substantial short-term
variability in JO2 in response to changes in turbulence is
emphasized in Fig. 6. However, an explicit relationship
between JO2 and e cannot be defined by the linear correlation
shown in Fig. 6, since JO2 is also affected by other variables
(e.g., Cbulk and RO2).
The relatively small standard deviation of JO2 and dDBL
obtained from the different methods per profile as
compared to the overall temporal variation in averages
(JO2 or dDBL) shows that similar estimates were obtained
from the different methods (Table 3). Water-side methods
did tend to yield somewhat higher values of JO2 (with
correspondingly lower values of dDBL). A comparative
evaluation of method results is being performed for the
companion methods study (L. Bryant, unpubl. data).
Standard deviation evolves according to changes in
turbulence. When turbulence levels are low, increasing
dDBL and decreasing e lead to greater uncertainty and
subsequently higher s (or intermittency) for these param-
eters. Thus, observed increases in variability in dDBL and e
during the period of weak turbulence (Tables 2 and 3) are
more an effect of analysis than a reflection of the quality of
data. While JO2, dDBL, and e values for profile 1 exhibit
unusually high variability, these increased deviations are
reflected in data obtained with multiple instruments (ADV
and microprofiler; Tables 2 and 3) and are observed only at
the beginning of the campaign; hence, they are likely a
result of equipment settling at the lake bottom following
deployment.
Sediment oxic zone—Changes in the extent of the
sediment oxic zone correspond to variations in JO2 and
dDBL in response to turbulence. When O2 transport into the
sediment escalated as the DBL was compressed by elevated
turbulence (Fig. 6), both zmax (Fig. 5) and the vertically
integrated mass of O2 (MO2; Table 4) increased significant-
ly as O2 penetrated deeper into the sediment. The oxic zone
is observed to reach a maximum zmax of 2.2 mm during
active turbulence (corresponding dDBL 5 1.0 mm, JO2 5
6.9 mmol m22 d21, and MO2 5 54 mmol m22). Conversely,
zmax decreased to a minimum of 0.3 mm and CSWI

decreased from 59 to 5 mmol L21 during negligible
turbulence (corresponding dDBL 5 7.6 mm, JO2 5
1.3 mmol m22 d21, and MO2 5 3 mmol m22) as the
sediment approached anoxia. The strongly coupled behav-
ior observed in these parameters is supported by recent
modeling work based on data from Lake Alpnach (Brand
et al. 2009), which shows that an increase in dDBL (from
0.25 to 1.5 mm) results in decreased zmax (from 1.7 to
1.2 mm) and decreased JO2 (from 15 to 9.5 mmol m22 d21).
Profile dynamics—Eq. 2 was used to determine proxim-
ity to steady state. Although significant variation was
observed in our O2 profiles over the 12-h measurement
period (Fig. 5), O2 accumulation and/or depletion within
the sediment was insignificant (Table 4), with an average
hC/hta of 60.30 mmol m22 d21, or , 5% of the average JO2
(5.2 mmol m22 d21) over the full measurement period. The
rate at which O2 enters the sediment (JO2) equals the areal
O2 consumption rate (RO2a) at steady state (Eq. 2), and
these values were found to be almost equivalent in our
mesotrophic lake system (Table 4). Additionally, the
average JO2 and MO2 (32 mmol m22; Table 4) for the 12-h
period indicate a mean O2 residence time in the sediment of
9 min. Because profiles were obtained every , 50 min,
quasi–steady-state conditions prevailed.
Discussion
Forcing of O2 distribution—Lorke et al. (2003) show that
dDBL is controlled primarily by turbulence rather than
velocity based on an observed phase lag between e, dDBL,
and current velocity, where e and dDBL lagged consistently
(, 1.5 h) behind current velocity at 1 m above the
sediment. Although we do observe a direct relationship
between e and dDBL, a defined phase lag between these
parameters and current velocity was not evident within the
temporal resolution of our measurements (Fig. 7). Howev-
er, it has been shown that this delay becomes greater with
increasing distance from the sediment (Lorke et al. 2002).
The phase lag would therefore be expected to be much
shorter (, 10 min) during our experiment.
During periods of relatively high velocity (profiles 1–5
and 9–14), turbulence increased as cold water from the
deeper region of the BBL moved across our experiment site
(Figs. 4, 7). The movement of this cooler water mass along
the slope may have established small inverse temperature
gradients that produced additional turbulence due to
bottom convective mixing (Lorke et al. 2005). Turbulence
compressed the DBL during these periods, which facilitated
increased O2 transport from the BBL down to the sediment
and resulted in greater sediment O2 uptake and an
enhanced sediment oxic zone. As the water mass ap-
proached current reversal (profiles 5–9), decreased turbu-
lence, JO2, and zmax are observed as current velocity
subsided (Figs. 5, 6).
Temperatures in the BBL and near the SWI increased
(Fig. 4a–c) in response to the influx of warm water from
farther up the slope (confirmed by CTD data, not shown).
Variations in temperature are reflected over the full
microsensor profile depth and are not affected by changes

Seiche forcing of sediment oxygen uptake

in dDBL, which is likely due to the relatively rapid rate of heat
transfer (compared to molecular diffusion) and the fact that
temperature is not consumed by the sediment (unlike O2).
Hence, once the near-surface sediment temperature equili-
brates with that of the BBL, the sediment no longer behaves
as a heat sink. Conversely, significant variation was
observed in the vertical distribution of O2 across the SWI,
which may be largely attributed to O2 consumption. In the
absence of turbulence, while O2 remained at , 110 mmol L21
several centimeters above the SWI, the O2 supply through
the extended DBL was insufficient to maintain the sediment
oxic zone (Figs. 4, 6). As JO2 diminished and O2 was
consumed in the sediment, O2 in the water immediately
overlying the sediment, CSWI, and zmax decreased signifi-
cantly (Figs. 4, 5). These findings emphasize that, even when
O2 levels in the BBL remain relatively high, the O2
distribution on both sides of the SWI and the corresponding
JO2 are strongly governed by turbulence, as supported by
previous work (Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985; Brand et al.
2009; Gantzer et al. 2009a).
Variations in sediment O2 consumption—Quasi-steady-
state conditions prevailed (JO2 and RO2a differed by only
5%) and, correspondingly, both JO2 and RO2 (quantified by
RO2a and RO2v) varied in response to dynamic forcing, as
shown by RO2a data in Table 4. This indicates that sediment
O2 consumption was directly related to O2 availability
within the sediment as supplied via JO2. Monod and first-
order kinetic models are used to characterize sediment O2
consumption as a function of O2 concentration in the
sediment (Rasmussen and Jørgensen 1992; Higashino et al.
2004). However, due to the variety of O2-consuming
processes and the complexity of the kinetics, simple zero-
order kinetics is frequently assumed (Bouldin 1968;
Jørgensen and Boudreau 2001; Røy et al. 2004). Irrespec-
tive of the kinetics, though, it has been reported that when
O2 uptake is at least partially governed by diffusive
transport, RO2 does become dependent on O2 concentration
below O2 levels of 20–30 mmol L21 (Santschi et al. 1990;
Berg et al. 2003). Sediment O2 levels remained close to this
minimum range during our study (Fig. 5). Our results
therefore demonstrate dependence of RO2 on O2 availability
under limiting O2 conditions regardless of the kinetics
involved. Models based on variable zones of O2 consump-
tion and Monod kinetics were used (zonefit and model
methods, respectively) to evaluate JO2 and dDBL with
comparable results (Table 3; L. Bryant unpubl. data).
Variability in sediment O2 consumption was further
evaluated using PROFILE (zonefit method) to characterize
regions of differing RO2v within the sediment oxic zone as a
function of time and depth, as shown in Fig. 8. Zone-
specific RO2v values predicted by PROFILE were corrected
for hC/htv (Eq. 2). PROFILE results show that RO2v was
consistently higher near the SWI and then decreased
significantly with depth (Fig. 8). Results by O’Connor
and Harvey (2008) and Brand et al. (2009) also show
increased RO2v immediately below the SWI. O2 consump-
tion in the upper sediment region is often elevated as a
result of mineralization of freshly deposited organic matter
at the sediment surface as well as reoxidation of subse-
quently released reduced inorganic species (Santschi et al.
1990; Zhang et al. 1999). Accordingly, increased hetero-
trophic bacterial abundance and activity in the sediment
surface layer is common (Fischer et al. 2002, 2005).

Variations in turbulence (Fig. 8a) coupled with changes
in PROFILE-predicted consumption zones (Fig. 8b–d)
support our observation of increased JO2 leading to
increased O2 consumption (Table 4). The upper sediment
layer is obviously most directly affected by turbulence in
the BBL and variations in dDBL. Consumption in this upper
zone is observed to increase during periods of peak
turbulence when elevated O2 concentrations above the
sediment and a thinner dDBL facilitate enhanced JO2.
Elevated RO2v in the upper sediment as a result of increased
O2 availability implies that the intrinsic capacity of the
sediment for O2 consumption (PSOD) exceeds JO2,
indicating water-side control of sediment O2 uptake
(O’Connor and Harvey 2008). When JO2 increased in
response to elevated turbulence, the sediment oxic zone is
observed to increase while hC/hta remained relatively small;
this supports that the additional O2 entering the sediment
was being consumed rather than accumulating in the
sediment (Fig. 8b,d; Table 4). During the period when
turbulence is at a minimum and dDBL extends to the point
of becoming undefined, thereby limiting O2 transport and
subsequent availability at the SWI, consumption is
characterized by a minimal zone and RO2v drops signifi-
cantly (Fig. 8c). At this point, the sediment oxic zone
almost completely disappears. The elasticity observed in
sediment–water O2 profiles shown in Fig. 5 is also evident
in sediment O2 consumption zones shown in Fig. 8,
although it is less direct because of the complexity of
sediment processes. The distribution of O2 consumption
zones for profile 13 (Fig. 8d) returns to a structure similar
to that of profile 4 (Fig. 8b) when turbulence increases after
a substantial shift to a smaller, single zone for profile 8
during the stagnant period (Fig. 8c).
Our results show that variations in dDBL have a
significant effect on JO2, RO2 (both areally and volumetri-
cally), and resultant zmax. It is important to emphasize that
in this study, diffusion time for O2 across the DBL and
transport time through the sediment oxic zone are
comparable (, 10 to 20 min during the majority of the
campaign when turbulence levels were high enough to
maintain a defined DBL). When the timescale of O2
diffusion through the DBL is short in comparison to
transport through the sediment oxic zone (e.g., oligotrophic
environments where zmax can be measured in centimeters
and sediment O2 residence time can be on the order of
days), changes in dDBL would be unlikely to have a strong
influence on JO2, RO2, and zmax (Glud et al. 2007).
Scale of variation—Mean values for JO2 (Table 4)
obtained during this study are comparable to values found
Fig. 5.
O2 microprofiles obtained at approximately 50-min
intervals relative to the ADV velocity time series. O2 profiles are
divided into three panels with corresponding section of velocity
time series plotted above each O2 profile panel (a–c). (a) Initially,
current velocity is increasing and the O2 profiles are observed to
shift to the right toward more oxic conditions in both the water
r
and the sediment with a corresponding decrease in dDBL and
increase in zmax. (b) As velocity decreases, dDBL is shown to
increase and zmax to decrease as the profiles shift to the left toward
anoxic conditions in the sediment and overlying water. (c) As
velocities return to initial levels, the O2 profiles are observed to
shift back to the right toward a more oxic distribution similar to
that observed in (a).

in previous studies of BBL turbulence at the same location.
Brand et al. (2008) estimated an average JO2 of 13 6
2 mmol m22 d21 and Lorke et al. (2003) estimated JO2 to
range from 6 to 13 mmol m22 d21, with a corresponding
dDBL range of 0.16 to 0.84 mm. Turbulence and O2 levels in
the BBL were higher in these previous studies than those
observed during our campaign; this is reflected in our
relatively low turbulence estimates and subsequently
decreased JO2 and increased dDBL values. Despite the less
energetic conditions, variation in JO2 and the vertical

Bryant et al.

distribution of O2 over the 12-h measurement period was
still significant (Figs. 5–7). The fact that we observed such
change in these parameters in response to dynamic, though
relatively mild, turbulence conditions highlights the depen-
dence of sediment O2 uptake on turbulence.
Not only was JO2 found to vary significantly over the
duration of a single seiche cycle (on the order of hours)
during our campaign (Fig. 6), but it was also observed to
change substantially on a subhourly timescale. For example,
in the course of the 53-min period between profiles 9 and 10
when turbulence increased as the waterbody shifted back
toward the southwest direction following current reversal,
JO2 increased from 1.1 mmol m22 d21 to 5.7 mmol m22 d21
(Table 4). During this time, e increased from 7.8 3 10212 to
2.5 3 10210 W kg21, dDBL decreased from 7.8 to 1.7 mm
(Fig. 7), zmax increased from 0.6 to 1.3 mm (Fig. 5), and MO2
increased from 5 to 24 mmol m22 (Table 4). The high degree
of variation observed in JO2 and the vertical O2 distribution
over such a brief time period illustrates the transient nature
of sediment O2 uptake. While it has been shown that long-
term (e.g., annual) average JO2 is typically not influenced by
short-term (e.g., hourly) changes in dDBL (Glud et al. 2007),
our results stress the importance of taking turbulence into
account when resolving O2 profiles in order to fully evaluate
JO2. Under dynamic conditions, a system must be charac-
terized in greater detail than what can be discerned from a
single profile. An accurate assessment of JO2 and RO2 is not
possible without obtaining a comprehensive series of profiles
describing the full range of variation in the vertical
distribution of O2. Furthermore, extreme caution should
be taken in evaluating PSOD based on RO2v analyses without
considering physical limitations on O2 transport to the SWI
(and subsequent O2 availability in the sediment) and
proximity to long-term steady state. Variation in PRO-
FILE-predicted RO2v results for individual profiles (Fig. 8)
emphasizes how evaluating RO2v based on a single profile
could lead to very different estimates of PSOD. In all
likelihood, the average RO2v observed during our 12-h
campaign (3.5 mmol m23 d21 in upper sediment; data not
shown) may still significantly underestimate actual PSOD
due to the mild turbulence conditions limiting sediment O2
availability and subsequent consumption.
Technical and logistical restraints often limit the number
of in situ microsensor measurements obtained during a
given deployment to only a few (Glud et al. 2009), which
may be an issue depending on the timescale of the dynamics
in the system of interest. During this study, we were able to
obtain 14 microprofiles at approximately 50-min intervals.
Fluctuations in dDBL have been previously observed at
timescales on the order of seconds (Røy et al. 2004;
O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). However, Brand et al. (2009)
show that the influence of these rapid variations in dDBL is
negligible on evaluations of mean JO2 and the vertical O2
distribution near the SWI at timescales appropriate for
defining seiche cycles (e.g., minutes, hours). The subhourly
timescale at which we assessed data is small compared to
the 8-h duration of the seiche cycle; thus, a thorough
characterization of how seiche-induced variations in
sediment O2 uptake was achieved.
In conclusion, our results reveal the effect of natural
dynamic forcing on the vertical distribution of O2 across
the SWI and on sediment O2 uptake. Although work has
been done that contributes significantly to the understand-
ing of BBL dynamics and flux pathways, these studies have
been largely laboratory or model based (Røy et al. 2004;
Glud et al. 2007; O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). Previous in
situ studies have focused primarily on physical, water-side
controls of O2 transport (Gundersen and Jørgensen 1990;
Lorke et al. 2003) or spatial and temporal variations in O2
distribution in sediment (Epping and Helder 1997; Glud et
al. 2003, 2009). This study is novel in that we analyzed O2
uptake from both sides of the SWI. In doing so, we have

* Profile-specific areal values of RO2a, hC/hta, and MO2 represent the integral over the depth of the sediment oxic zone. hC/hta was evaluated for each profile
as follows: the profiles immediately before and after were compared (e.g., profiles 2 and 4 were compared to evaluate profile 3) to calculate the areal rate
of change in O2 (hC/hta).
{ Quasi–steady state is established by relatively insignificant values of hC/hta (5% of average JO2).
Seiche forcing of sediment oxygen uptake
961

expanded on previous results by analyzing the tight
coupling between water-side (turbulence, as characterized
by e) and sediment-side (O2 consumption in sediment, as
characterized by RO2) processes influencing sediment O2
uptake under actual field conditions in a freshwater system.
The highly transient nature of JO2 is revealed by rapid
changes in the vertical distribution of O2 in both the water
and the sediment in response to dynamic forcing via seiche
motion. RO2 was shown to adjust quickly to variations in
JO2 at quasi–steady state. Although our study focused on
O2 fluxes, knowledge gained regarding the relationship
between turbulence and mass transfer at the SWI can be
more broadly applied to fluxes of other soluble chemical
species (e.g., reduced metals, hydrogen sulfide, methane) as
well (Jørgensen et al. 1979; Frenzel et al. 1990; Gantzer et
al. 2009b). The crucial role of turbulence is highlighted by
the fact that, despite relatively high O2 levels only a few
centimeters above the sediment, O2 transport to the SWI
and the extent of the sediment oxic zone both decreased
substantially during quiescent periods. The critical control
that dynamic forcing can have on JO2 must be considered
when evaluating sediment O2 uptake via measuring devices
(e.g., benthic chambers) that do not capture natural
turbulence conditions. Furthermore, based on the signifi-
cant changes observed in JO2 during periods as brief as an
hour, our results show that using isolated JO2 measure-
ments may be insufficient, particularly in systems experi-
encing high levels of variable turbulence.

Problems related to low levels of dissolved oxygen (O2) in
aquatic ecosystems are growing on a global scale (Jankowski et
al. 2006; Zimmerman et al. 2008). O2 depletion in stratified
waters is largely controlled by sediment O2 uptake, particularly
in organic-rich environments (Higashino et al. 2004). Flux of
O2 across the sediment–water interface (SWI) may be governed
by near-sediment hydrodynamic processes or by O2 consump-
tion within the sediment (Gundersen and Jørgensen 1990; Jør-
gensen and Boudreau 2001; Glud et al. 2007). Turbulence in
the bottom boundary layer (BBL) controls the thickness (δDBL)
of the diffusive boundary layer (DBL), the millimeter-scale
region immediately above the sediment that typically regulates
mass transport of O2 to the SWI in non-advective, water-
side–controlled systems (Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985; Lorke
et al. 2003; Bryant et al. 2010). Within the sediment, the dis-
tribution of O2 is then determined by a balance between the
amount of O2 supplied via diffusion and/or other transport
processes (e.g., bioturbation) and the amount of O2 used by
biogeochemical oxidation processes (Berg et al. 2003). Quanti-
fying the O2 flux into the sediment, or the sediment O2 uptake

Abstract
Sediment–water fluxes are influenced by both hydrodynamics and sediment biogeochemical processes. However,
fluxes at the sediment–water interface (SWI) are almost always analyzed from either a water- or sediment-side per-
spective. This study expands on previous work by comparing water-side (hydrodynamics and resulting diffusive
boundary layer thickness, δDBL) and sediment-side (oxygen consumption and resulting sediment oxic zone)
approaches for evaluating diffusive sediment oxygen uptake rate (JO2) and δDBL from microprofiles. Dissolved oxy-
gen microprofile and current velocity data were analyzed using five common methods to estimate JO2 and δDBL and
to assess the robustness of the approaches. Comparable values for JO2 and δDBL were obtained (agreement within
20%), and turbulence-induced variations in these parameters were uniformly characterized with the five methods.
JO2 estimates based on water-side data were consistently higher (+1.8 mmol m–2 d–1 or 25% on average) and δDBL esti-
mates correspondingly lower (–0.4 mm or 35% on average) than those obtained using sediment-side data. This devi-
ation may be attributed to definition of the sediment–water interface location, artifacts of the methods themselves,
assumptions made on sediment properties, and/or variability in sediment oxygen-uptake processes. Our work
emphasizes that sediment-side microprofile data may more accurately describe oxygen uptake at a particular loca-
tion, whereas water-side data are representative of oxygen uptake over a broader sediment area. Regardless, our over-
all results show clearly that estimates of JO2 and δDBL are not strongly dependent on the method chosen for analysis.

Bryant et al.
Evaluating O2 flux on both sides of SWI
611
rate (JO2), is fundamental in characterizing the availability of O2
and corresponding ecological conditions in an aquatic system.
A wealth of literature exists on the various methods used
for estimating JO2 (Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985; Nishihara
and Ackerman 2007; Glud 2008). JO2 is typically evaluated
from either a water- or a sediment-side perspective (O’Connor
et al. 2009). Considerable research has focused on hydrody-
namic controls of δDBL and corresponding O2 transport to the
sediment (Boudreau 2001; Lorke et al. 2003; Hondzo et al.
2005). Water-side, δDBL-based approaches are simpler because
they do not account for O2 consumption within the sediment
and thus only diffusive mass transfer is considered (Glud
2008; O’Connor and Harvey 2008). However, both rapid tur-
bulence-driven variations in δDBL and the short residence time
of O2 in the DBL cause δDBL to be a difficult parameter to
resolve (Røy et al. 2004; O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). Fur-
thermore, microsensor measurements of the DBL can disrupt
boundary-layer flow, leading to compression of the DBL and
thus changing δDBL (Glud et al. 1994).
Whereas problems with characterizing a transient δDBL are
avoided by using sediment-side methods, there are additional
complexities related to O2 transport and consumption processes
within the sediment (Glud 2008). Sediment-side data are often
more difficult to interpret due to natural sediment heterogene-
ity (e.g., small-scale variations in porosity and grain size; Maerki
et al. 2004). Variations in sediment O2 levels are more site-spe-
cific owing to sediment heterogeneity, while relatively uniform
water-side O2 concentrations are maintained by lateral advec-
tion and mixing in the BBL, which provide an averaging effect
on localized influences (O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). Sedi-
ment O2 consumption processes can vary spatially (e.g.,
increased reactive surface area due to microtopography; Røy et
al. 2002) and/or occur nonlocally (e.g., small-scale variation in
benthic communities; Rabouille et al. 2003; Glud et al. 2009).
Despite complications associated with localized sediment het-
erogeneity, porewater O2 profile data can reveal important
information about the sediment O2 consumption rate (RO2), the
extent of the sediment oxic zone (Epping and Helder 1997; Berg
et al. 1998; Bryant et al. 2010), and solute dynamics (Berg et al.
2007a; Glud et al. 2007; Brand et al. 2009).
Although numerous approaches are used for assessing JO2,
no single method has been shown to be optimal, and further
evaluation of how the various methods compare is needed
(Nishihara and Ackerman 2007; Glud 2008). Furthermore,
because sediment O2 uptake can be affected by processes on
both sides of the SWI, evaluating JO2 from a one-sided per-
spective could result in different and biased interpretations of
JO2 and RO2. Using in situ velocity and O2 microprofile data
obtained during a companion study on the dynamic nature of
JO2 (Bryant et al. 2010), the present work evaluates the robust-
ness of several established methods for diffusive flux estima-
tion based on both water- and sediment-side microprofiles.
Some of the methods assessed have thus far been applied pri-
marily in laboratory-based studies and/or rarely in situ
(O’Connor and Hondzo 2008; Brand et al. 2009). The advan-
tages and limitations of the different methods are discussed
with respect to analytical approach and applicability. To our
knowledge, while estimations of JO2 based on (1) bottom
boundary currents, (2) the vertical distribution of O2 above the
sediment, and (3) sediment porewater concentration data
have been well justified in previous work (Jørgensen and Revs-
bech 1985; Rasmussen and Jørgensen 1992; Lorke et al. 2003),
this is one of the first studies that incorporates all three of
these components into a comprehensive evaluation of JO2 and
δDBL using in situ data.
Materials and procedures
Study site and in situ instrumentation—During a 12-h field
campaign in Lake Alpnach, Switzerland, on August 27–28,
2007, high-resolution SWI microprofile and velocity data were
collected at a depth of 22 m to determine JO2 and δDBL. Basic
information on the experimental setup used is described here,
with additional details included in the companion paper
(Bryant et al. 2010). Frequently used acronyms and notations
are defined in Table 1.
High-resolution O2 profiles were measured across the SWI
using a microprofiler (MP4; Unisense A/S) equipped with a
Clark-type O2 microsensor (100-µm outer tip diameter and
spatial resolution, membrane diameter 3–10 µm, negligible
stirring sensitivity, and 90% response time in <8 s). Profiles
were measured continuously (profile duration of ~50 min) at
the following resolution: 10-mm increments from 10 cm to 1
cm above the SWI, 1-mm increments from 1 cm to 0.5 cm
above the SWI, and 0.1-mm increments from 0.5 cm above to
0.5 cm below the SWI. Profiles were obtained at the smallest
vertical resolution possible (100 µm, as defined by sensor-tip
diameter) near the SWI to maximize the number of data
points characterizing changes in the O2 concentration gradi-
ent in this region. Microsensors of 100-µm diameter were used
to balance spatial resolution and robustness. After a pause
between measurements to establish equilibrium, 10 data
points were collected at a rate of 1 Hz at each depth; no trend
in variation of the data set was evident, confirming that data
aliasing did not occur. Fourteen O2 profiles were obtained dur-
ing our 12-h campaign, and the O2 profile number (1–14) is
used for comparison of results. Although the profiles were
obtained at the same location, artifacts from repeated profil-
ing are assumed to be negligible based on (1) the absence of
consistent changes (e.g., oxic regions) after reprofiling (sup-
ported by work by B. Müller [unpubl.] and Lorke et al. 2003);
(2) the high sediment porosity (≥0.95; discussed below); and
(3) the short residence time of the upper sediment (<10 min;
Bryant et al. 2010). An O2 logger (TDO-2050; RBR Ltd.) was
mounted on the microprofiler 8 cm above the sediment for
independent measurements of BBL O2 concentrations. These
TDO data, collected at 1 Hz, were used with O2 microsensor
measurements taken in the anoxic sediment to calibrate the
O2 microsensor. The TDO-2050 has a 90% response time of

<10 s, measurement range 0% to 150% O2 saturation, resolu-
tion ±1% O2 saturation, and accuracy ±2% O2 saturation.
TDO-2050 data were calibrated via Winkler titration of water
samples obtained from the same depth with a Niskin bottle.
Water-velocity time series corresponding to each O2 profile
were collected continuously at a single point using an acoustic
Doppler velocimeter (ADV; Vector, Nortek). The ADV, fixed
vertically on a tripod with the sampling volume positioned 15
cm below the ADV transducer and 10 cm above the sediment,
continuously measured three-dimensional velocity data at 32
Hz with an accuracy of 0.5% of the measured value or ±0.1 cm
s–1. ADV velocity data were used to analyze the current struc-
ture and to characterize turbulence and friction velocity
within the law-of-the-wall layer.
Turbulence analyses—Turbulence in the BBL was defined by
the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy e (W kg–1)
using the inertial dissipation method (Grant et al. 1962). Addi-
tional details on how turbulence was analyzed may be found
in Bryant et al. (2010). Average e values were assessed based on
the duration of each O2 profile, and hence e estimates repre-
sent a time span of ~50 min. Because turbulence is highly
intermittent, dissipation is averaged by assuming log-normal
distribution. Standard deviations of ln(e), or the intermittency
of e, were evaluated using the method of Baker and Gibson
(1987).
Friction velocity analyses—Friction velocity (u*) quantifies
the stress of BBL currents on the sediment. Law-of-the-wall
theory and estimated mean e values were used to calculate u*
at a height (h) of 10 cm above the sediment (Lorke et al. 2003):
[m s–1]

where k (von Karman constant) is 0.41.
Methods for JO2 analyses—Five different methods (direct, u*,
curvefit, zonefit, and model; Table 1) were used to analyze JO2
and δDBL using data collected on both sides of the SWI (Fig. 1).
Water-side O2 microprofile data were used for the direct
method and the u* method, which also incorporates ADV
velocity data. Sediment-side O2 microprofile data were ana-
lyzed with polynomial equations (curvefit method) and using

Each method yielded results for either JO2 or δDBL, and then
the related parameter (δDBL or JO2, respectively) was evaluated
using Fick’s first law of diffusion (Rasmussen and Jørgensen
1992; Lavery et al. 2001; Higashino et al. 2004):
[mmol m–2 d–1] (2)
where ϕ is sediment porosity (m3 voids m–3 total volume), Ds
is the diffusion coefficient for O2 in sediment (m2 s–1), D is the
diffusion coefficient for O2 in water (m2 s–1), and (∂C/∂z)s and
(∂C/∂z)w are the O2 concentration gradients in the sediment at
the SWI and in the DBL water immediately above the SWI,
respectively (µmol m–4), where depth (z) and corresponding JO2
are defined as positive into the sediment with z = 0 mm at the
SWI. Cbulk is the O2 concentration in the bulk BBL (µmol L–1),
and CSWI is the O2 concentration at the SWI (µmol L–1), as
shown in Fig. 1b. Diffusive transport is hence defined in the
sediment by the first expression in Eq. 2 and in the water by
the second and third expressions. Values for D were based on
D = 1.97 × 10–9 m2 s–1 at 20°C, correcting for temperature using
the Stokes-Einstein relationship (Li and Gregory 1974; Arega
and Lee 2005). Ds was defined as ϕD (multiplying by ϕ pro-
vides a correction for tortuosity that ignores other possible
higher-order parameterizations; Berg et al. 1998; Glud 2008).
This simple tortuosity correction increases the influence of ϕ
on diffusive transport in the sediment (ϕDs = ϕ2D in the first
expression in Eq. 2). The temporal change in O2 concentration
(∂C/∂t) was evaluated for our series of 14 O2 profiles by com-
paring profiles immediately before and after one another and
calculating the rate of change in O2 at each depth. Depth-inte-
grated, areal ∂C/∂t (∂C/∂t)a was found to be on average ~5% of
JO2 (Bryant et al. 2010), thus establishing that our profiles were
at quasi-steady state.
In the absence of a video camera, SWI estimation was based
both on visual interpretation of the profiles individually and
as a series (identifying linear DBL regions and on profile kinks
related to ϕ differences between the water and the sediment;
Røy et al. 2004) and on assessment of O2 standard deviations
(variation should decrease approaching the SWI due to
reduced turbulence fluctuations; Müller et al. 2002; Brand et
al. 2007). To account for ϕ when Eq. 2 was applied to porewa-
ter for the sediment-side methods, ϕ measurements were per-
formed on cores taken from our experiment site (following
protocol per Dalsgaard et al. 2000). Additionally, supporting ϕ
predictions were estimated using the numerical model PRO-
FILE (Berg et al. 1998) to analyze ϕ at a greater depth resolu-
tion than possible with core tests (Bryant et al. 2010). Inde-
pendent average JO2 values (JO2i, based on a separate set of
microprofiles from the same site and on sediment core ϕ data)
were evaluated via the other four methods (excluding zonefit,
i.e., PROFILE), and then a trial-and-error approach was used to
estimate depth-specific ϕ values (which PROFILE uses as an
input parameter) required to simulate JO2i. From these evalua-
tions, average ϕ values of 0.95 in the upper 1 mm and 0.90 at
>1 mm below the SWI were obtained and subsequently used
in JO2 calculations and/or as model input parameters.
JO2 estimates obtained using Fick’s law (Eq. 2) describe dif-
fusive, not total, O2 uptake. Hence, influences on nondiffusive
O2 uptake, such as variations in sediment topography, advec-
tive porewater flow (typical of porous sediment), and irriga-
tion, are not taken into account (Berg et al. 1998; Jørgensen
2001). Whereas non-diffusive O2 uptake processes could have
been incorporated into some of our analyses (e.g., biodiffusiv-
ity and irrigation may be included as input parameters in PRO-
FILE), these effects were neglected for the sake of consistent
comparison between methods.
Direct method: JO2 was evaluated directly from the linear
slope of the DBL as measured via O2 microsensor (Fig. 1b). The
DBL slope (∂C/∂z)w was incorporated into Eq. 2 to obtain JO2
and corresponding δDBL. The third expression in Eq. 2 quanti-
fies δDBL in terms of an “effective” DBL (Jørgensen and Revs-
bech 1985), which is obtained by extrapolating (∂C/∂z)w at the
SWI to Cbulk in the water column. This conceptual definition
of the DBL corresponds to the extension of the “true” DBL
(based solely on the actual linear region) from the laminar
region above the SWI to the mixed bulk region.
u* method: Because accurate microsensor measurements of
the DBL are challenging, an alternative method has been
developed that estimates δDBL as a function of hydrodynamics
(Hondzo et al. 2005; O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). This
method uses a simplified dimensionless power law for the uni-
versal scaling of the vertical O2 distribution in the bulk water
to estimate δDBL (Fig. 1c). Dimensionless power law scaling was
applied to friction velocity (u*) data derived from ADV veloc-
ity series to solve for a nondimensional DBL thickness (
;
Hondzo et al. 2005):

where C+, h+ (= hu* ν–1), and 
are nondimensional parame-
ters for concentration, height, and estimated δDBL from the
power law, respectively. ν is kinematic viscosity (corrected for
temperature), B is an integration constant, and Sct is the tur-
bulent Schmidt number. We found the product BSct to have a
functional dependence on the Reynolds number (Re = u* δDBL
ν–1) across the series of 14 in situ profiles during our relatively
low turbulence conditions. BSct and the profile-specific 
were used to fit the power law to water-side O2 profile data
immediately above the SWI and evaluate the point at which
the two curves defining C+ (h+ < 
and h+ ≥ 
, as defined
in Eq. 3) converge. Once 
was estimated (Fig. 1c), it was
used to obtain the actual DBL thickness (δDBL):

The corresponding JO2 was then calculated using the third
expression in Eq. 2.
Curvefit method: This method is based on characterizing
the sediment oxic zone with the polynomial C(z) that best fits
the profile curve (Fig. 1d) immediately below the SWI (Urban
et al. 1997; Glud 2008). A majority of our data were described
most accurately by third-order polynomials (profile 6 required
a fourth-order equation). Taking the first derivative of C(z),
which defines O2 as a function of depth z, and evaluating this
function at the sediment surface (z = 0) yields a constant
(∂C/∂z)s that can be incorporated into Eq. 2 to solve for JO2 and
δDBL.
Zonefit method: Sediment porewater O2 data were analyzed
using PROFILE (Berg et al. 1998). PROFILE is based on zero-
order kinetics and defines zones of constant volumetric O2
consumption (RO2v; Table 1) to best characterize a sediment O2
profile (Fig. 1e). At steady state, RO2v may be defined by the
derivative of Eq. 2 (Rasmussen and Jørgensen 1992; Glud
2008):
[mmol m–3 d–1]
(5)
The PROFILE algorithm solves Eq. 5 numerically and reduces
the number of zones necessary for obtaining an optimal fit
using statistical F-testing. From this statistical analysis, the
simplest O2 consumption–production profile is selected that
best models the porewater profile data. We found that the full
set of 14 profiles was typically characterized by one or two
consumption zones, as also determined by Brand et al. (2008).
Our 14 O2 profiles were used as input data for the numerical
procedure. Boundary conditions were defined by O2 flux and
concentration evaluated at the bottom of the profile (JO2 = 0
mmol m–2 d–1 and C = 0 µmol L–1, respectively). Parameters
used for the model include D, Ds, and ϕ as defined above. Irri-
gation and biodiffusivity effects were assumed to be negligible.
Balancing O2 transport and consumption results in
[mmol m–2 d–1]
(6)
where RO2v (mmol m–3 d–1) and the change in O2 over time
(∂C/∂t, mmol m–3 d–1) are integrated over the sediment profile
depth to zmax (designated as the depth below the SWI where O2
drops to <3 µmol L–1). Depth-integrated values of RO2v and
∂C/∂t, defined areally by RO2a and (∂C/∂t)a, allow for direct
comparison with JO2 (mmol m–2 d–1). JO2 values based on PRO-
FILE results were incorporated into Eq. 2 to obtain correspon-
ding δDBL.
Model method: We used AQUASIM (Reichert 1994) to fit
measured O2 porewater data to the transport-reaction equa-
tion:
[mmol m–3 d–1]
(7)
which defines diffusion and consumption by Monod kinetics,
where µ is the maximum oxidation rate (mmol m–3 d–1) and
KO2 is the half-saturation constant (µmol L–1). The second
expression in Eq. 7 thus characterizes RO2v in terms of Monod
kinetics. Monod parameters were obtained using a diffusion-
reaction model developed with the sediment module of
AQUASIM version 2.1e (Reichert 1994; Brand et al. 2009),
which was adapted to include tortuosity effects via Ds. A sin-
gle set of Monod parameters (µ = 3620 mmol m–3 d–1 and KO2
= 8.0 µmol L–1) was found to characterize steady-state O2 con-
sumption for the series of 14 O2 profiles, with CSWI as the only
variable. These Monod parameters were subsequently incor-
porated into a second model run that used Cbulk as the upper
boundary condition and δDBL as the sole fitting parameter to
reproduce our sediment O2 data and estimate δDBL (Fig. 1f) for
the full set of profiles. The model method thus allowed us to
assess an alternative kinetic approach and to model δDBL
directly from sediment-side data (the zonefit method is based
on zero-order O2 consumption and does not predict δDBL). JO2
was estimated by incorporating AQUASIM-modeled δDBL into
Eq. 2.
Assessment
Dynamic forcing of O2 distribution—Turbulence-induced vari-
ation in our O2 profile data allowed us to assess the perform-
ance and applicability of the different methods for JO2 over a
range of turbulence levels. The vertical distribution of O2 on
both sides of the SWI (as characterized by δDBL and zmax; Fig. 1a)
and JO2 were found to be strongly influenced by BBL turbu-
lence during the 12-h measurement period (Fig. 2; Bryant et
al. 2010). JO2 and δDBL values shown in Fig. 2 are based on aver-
age results of the five methods. Quantified values presented in
this study differ slightly (<5% on average) from those in
Bryant et al. (2010) owing to a difference in how sediment tor-
tuosity was accounted for (Ds; discussed below), but overall
results were not affected. JO2 ranged from 6.8 ± 1.9 mmol m–2
d–1 during peak turbulence (e = 1.2 × 10–8 W kg–1) to 1.0 ± 0.3
mmol m–2 d–1 during negligible turbulence (e = 7.8 × 10–12 W
kg–1), as shown in Fig. 2a. Corresponding variation in u* is also
shown. The DBL was suppressed to a minimum δDBL of 1.1 ±
0.1 mm, and zmax increased to 2.2 mm during peak turbulence
(Fig. 2b). When turbulence levels dropped, zmax decreased to
0.3 mm and δDBL increased to the point of becoming techni-
cally undefined (Gantzer and Stefan 2003; Røy et al. 2004).
However, a conceptual δDBL was quantified for the sake of com-
parison during this quiescent period, and a nominal maxi-
mum δDBL of 8.0 ± 2.4 mm was obtained. Average δDBL and JO2
(describing the full O2 profile set) used for comparative assess-
ment of methods were based on data obtained during active
turbulence when a defined δDBL was maintained (excluding
profiles 8 and 9).
Comparison of results—We found JO2 and δDBL estimates from
the different methods to be comparable within 20% on aver-
age relative to overall change (85%) throughout the experi-
ment (Fig. 3). The range in JO2 and δDBL values obtained per

profile from the different methods (e.g., the five individual JO2
values for profile 5) is relatively small compared to overall
temporal variation in averages (e.g., the mean JO2 values for
profiles 5 and 7). Furthermore, the trend in turbulence-
induced changes in JO2 (and corresponding δDBL) is well pre-
served by all five methods (Figs. 2 and 3). Although there are
acknowledged conceptual and methodological difficulties
with quantifying δDBL during quiescent conditions, the meth-
ods performed reasonably well during the period of negligible
turbulence, with no significant increase in variation relative to
average δDBL (or JO2).
Estimates of JO2 obtained with water-side (direct and u*)
methods were consistently higher (and δDBL estimates corre-
spondingly lower) than those obtained via sediment-side
(curvefit, zonefit, and model) methods (Fig. 3). JO2 based on
water-side data were on average 25% higher than estimates
based on sediment-side data, whereas δDBL values were on aver-
age 35% lower (relative to water-side JO2 and δDBL; differences
of +1.8 mmol m–2 d–1 and –0.4 mm, respectively) during active
turbulence. Potential reasons for deviation between water-
and sediment-side results are discussed below.
To measure the statistical range of results from the five
methods, standard deviations (σ) were calculated assuming a
normal distribution. Data for σJO2 and σDBL are shown in Fig. 2.
Standard deviations remained relatively low, although varia-
tion was observed at certain points during the campaign. Dur-
ing periods of inactive turbulence, increasing δDBL and decreas-
ing e led to greater uncertainty and subsequent increases in σ
and e intermittency. Although increased variability in δDBL and
e was observed during the quiescent period, this was most
likely an effect of analysis rather than an indication of poor
data quality. Increased variation in JO2, δDBL, and e estimates for
profile 1 was attributed to equipment settling (Bryant et al.
2010), and hence these data were considered outliers.
Evaluation of each method—In general, each method could
be applied to the full profile set for estimations of JO2 and δDBL.
Data were more difficult to analyze during periods of negligi-
ble turbulence (profiles 8 and 9) because of the disintegration
of a measurable DBL (direct method), increased uncertainty in
u* estimates (u* method), and the breakdown of curvature of
sediment porewater O2 profiles (curvefit, zonefit, and model
methods). Furthermore, as with all analytical approaches,
each of the methods was found to have both benefits and lim-
itations that had to be considered during analysis and/or
assessment. Unless otherwise noted, method results are com-
pared in the following sections using percent difference calcu-
lated with respect to average JO2 or δDBL.
Direct method: This method is the most traditional and
straightforward (Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985). However,
while the O2 gradient (∂C/∂z)w is relatively simple to measure
for the quantification of JO2 (Eq. 2), estimating the actual δDBL
directly from O2 profiles is more problematic due to rapid
changes in δDBL (Røy et al. 2004). The true endpoint of the
linear (∂C/∂z)w gradient in the DBL is also often undefined.
Jørgensen and Revsbech (1985) addressed this issue by estab-
lishing the effective DBL (Eq. 2) for evaluation of δDBL.
Because of the disintegration of the intersection point
between the linear DBL region and the constant bulk region
in many of our O2 profiles (observed in profile 14, Fig. 1b),
we were unable to precisely capture the true DBL because of
turbulence-induced variations in the Cbulk endpoint during
the ~50-min period required to measure a full profile. Esti-
mating the true δDBL visually from the strictly linear region of
our measured O2 profiles yielded values 71% less than aver-
age δDBL results (not shown).
Whereas the effective δDBL approach has been found to over-
estimate δDBL (Nishihara and Ackerman 2007; O’Connor et al.
2009), direct method δDBL was typically slightly lower (11% on
average) than mean δDBL (Fig. 3). Our results are in agreement
with those obtained by Jørgensen (2001), who found effective
δDBL to be similar to δDBL estimated as a function of hydrody-
namics using alabaster plate measurements. Although the
direct method was relatively easy to apply to our O2 profiles
with comparable results, Nishihara and Ackerman (2007) have
suggested a similar but alternate approach using a hyperbolic

(u*) as a function of O2 profile number. (b), Turbulence-induced variations
in the vertical O2 distribution on both sides of the SWI (as characterized
by δDBL and zmax). JO2 and δDBL values shown are the averages from the five
methods investigated here (Fig. 1). Modified from Bryant et al. (2010).

tangent (rather than a straight line) to define ∂C/∂z, which may
be optimal for profiles exhibiting nonlinearity in the DBL.
u* method: While the other four methods are based purely
on O2 microsensor data, the u* method is unique in that it
incorporates water-column hydrodynamics (as characterized
by u*) into the assessment of δDBL. Estimations of δDBL from the
u* method are based on both O2 microsensor and ADV veloc-
ity data (used to determine u*), thus allowing for a more rigor-
ous evaluation of mean δDBL and JO2. The temporal and spatial
scales of u* and microsensor measurements differed in that u*
data were collected at 32 Hz and determined at 10 cm above
the sediment (dm scale), whereas microprofiles were collected
subhourly at mm scale across the SWI. However, previous
work (Lorke et al. 2003) has established the relationship
between δDBL and velocity at 1 m above the sediment, sup-
porting the use of time-averaged u* estimates at 10 cm to char-
acterize each microsensor profile.
The u* method was shown by Hondzo et al. (2005) to pre-
dict δDBL values ~30% lower than the effective δDBL (i.e., direct
method). Similarly, our u*-based δDBL estimates were consis-
tently lower than direct method estimates (but within ± 14%;
relative to direct method; Fig. 3) and 23% less than average
δDBL. As previously defined, the u* method estimates δDBL as a
function of the fitting parameter 
and Reynolds num-
ber–dependent BSct using power law scaling of water-side O2
data. Although the power law easily fit most of our data (e.g.,
profile 14 in Fig. 1c and profile 3 in Fig. 4a), the fit was less
than ideal for several profiles that had increased scatter in bulk
water O2 (e.g., profile 11, Fig. 4b). Because the fits were affected
by both 
and BSct, in several cases the fit was not particu-

larly sensitive to 
. These cases were unsystematic, and the
resulting combinations varied only slightly from one another,
with δDBL estimations differing by up to ±0.1 mm (<10% of
average δDBL during active turbulence). For these situations, the
larger, more conservative value of δDBL was chosen.
Although JO2 and/or δDBL are commonly assessed as a func-
tion of current velocity or u* data in laboratory studies (Mack-
enthun and Stefan 1998; Røy et al. 2004; Hondzo et al. 2005),
our study is one of the few that have evaluated JO2 and δDBL as
a function of turbulence based on in situ current velocity. It is
acknowledged that velocity-based approaches may not always
be appropriate at low energy (e.g., periodically forced lakes
and reservoirs) because turbulence, rather than velocity, con-
trols δDBL (Lorke et al. 2003). During periods of inactive turbu-
lence, law-of-the-wall theory does not apply (Lorke et al. 2002)
and u* is conceptually not defined. The u* method may not be
as applicable during these periods. Variation between u*-based
estimates and the other methods was not observed to increase
during the period of inactive turbulence (profiles 8 and 9, Fig.
3) though, indicating that the u* method performed ade-
quately even under low-e conditions.
To further evaluate the validity of estimating δDBL as a func-
tion of in situ velocity during low turbulence and also to test
the robustness of the other methods using an independent
approach, values of u*-based δDBL and average δDBL were com-
pared to the Batchelor length scale (LB) for O2 (Fig. 5). LB char-
acterizes the minimum length scale of concentration where
molecular diffusion begins to reduce concentration gradients
(Lorke et al. 2003). Elevated turbulence sustains concentration
fluctuations at a smaller scale, which parallels δDBL behavior. LB
may hence be used as an alternative method of estimating δDBL
as a function of e, as developed by Hearn and Robson (2000):
[m]
(8)
Although LB was defined conceptually for open flow rather
than for a boundary layer, Lorke et al. (2003) show agreement
between LB and δDBL despite a substantial spatial gap (~1 m)
between e and O2 measurements. Taking into account the
much smaller spatial gap (~0.1 m) between our measurements,
the correlation observed in Fig. 5 further validates δDBL scaling
based on LB.
Because both LB and u* are a function of e, we specifically
evaluated the relationship between LB and u* method results
for δDBL. We also compared LB to average δDBL (both including
all methods and excluding u* method to isolate the influence
of u* results). As shown in Fig. 5, all three estimates of δDBL cor-
relate well with LB (R2 = 0.95 to 0.96). O’Connor et al. (2009)
observed similarity between LB and u*-based δDBL as well,
although δDBL values based on O2 profile data were found to be
overestimated in comparison. Conversely, we observed a
strong relationship between LB and both δDBL averages (Fig. 5).
Our δDBL estimates based on u* and purely on O2 profile data
are thus supported by LB results.
Curvefit method: Mean values of JO2 and δDBL based on
curvefit results were within ~10% of the average (Fig. 3). Fit-
ting curves to porewater profiles has been used effectively to
quantify kinetic rates of O2 consumption and corresponding
O2 fluxes in previous work (Nielsen et al. 1990). Ideally, deriv-
atives of the best-fitting curve can be used to evaluate JO2 and
RO2v (Rasmussen and Jørgensen 1992). Zero-order kinetics are
characterized by second-order polynomials and first-order
kinetics by exponential equations (Bouldin 1968). Third-order
polynomials, though, were found to best fit a majority of the
sediment O2 profiles in our data set. It was also difficult to fit
a single curve throughout the full depth of the oxic zone for
many of our profiles. Therefore, emphasis was placed on pre-
cisely fitting the region of the curve immediately at the SWI
and incorporating the derivative at z = 0 into Eq. 2. That our
data could not be defined by a single second-order polynomial
indicates that consumption rates were dependent on depth,
which was further explored using multiple zero-order con-
sumption zones (zonefit method) and Monod kinetics (model
method).
Zonefit method: The zonefit method yielded mean JO2 and
δDBL estimates that were 5% lower and 2% higher, respectively,
than average values (Fig. 3). The approach used for this
method, based on splining multiple second-order polynomials
together to best fit a sediment O2 profile, is advantageous
because it does not assume complex reaction laws and assigns
zero-order kinetic rates to as many different zones as needed to

adequately reproduce the measured profile. The use of multiple
zones allows for a good fit to be obtained even for atypical pro-
files (Maerki et al. 2006). Key benefits of the PROFILE numeri-
cal model include simplicity and broad-ranging applicability.
PROFILE may be used for any solute that is produced or con-
sumed. Also, variations in ϕ, biodiffusion, and irrigation may
be easily incorporated into PROFILE as a function of profile
depth. As with most numerical modeling work, the zonefit
method (as well as the model method) was initially labor inten-
sive. However, once the PROFILE model is set up, PROFILE runs
quickly and is faster than AQUASIM (model method).
Results from both the zonefit and model methods were
used to infer additional information about the sediment. In
addition to evaluating JO2 and δDBL, both of these methods
were used to predict how O2 consumption varied as a function
of depth and O2 availability within the sediment oxic zone.
Variations in PROFILE-predicted RO2v and zero-order O2 con-
sumption zones in response to turbulence-induced changes in
JO2 and subsequent O2 availability are shown in green in Fig. 6
(discussed further below). Although ∂C/∂t was minimal (5%
on average) for our quasi–steady-state system, zone-specific
RO2v values in Fig. 6 were corrected for ∂C/∂t by establishing a
mass balance (Eq. 6) between O2 consumption zones over the
depth of each profile.
Model method: The model method evaluates both sides of
the SWI simultaneously to directly estimate δDBL. Whereas the
model we used, formulated in the sediment module of AQUA-
SIM, is largely based on fitting porewater O2 data and defining
sediment O2 consumption (hence, considered a sediment-side
method), water-side data (Cbulk) were also used to define the
upper boundary condition (the lower boundary condition was
defined by zero flux). Because our diffusion-reaction model
provided δDBL as an output parameter for a steady-state solu-
tion, we were thus able to estimate δDBL directly from porewa-
ter and bulk water data. Alternatively, the curvefit and zonefit
methods evaluate JO2 from porewater data and then δDBL was
calculated via Eq. 2. On average, model method estimations of
δDBL were found to be 21% higher (JO2 correspondingly 20%
lower) than the overall mean (Fig. 3). AQUASIM-estimated δDBL
are delineated by the red water-side fit lines shown in Fig. 6.
Monod parameters estimated by AQUASIM to best charac-
terize our O2 profile data and model δDBL were also used to eval-
uate how RO2v changed as a function of depth and time (Fig. 6).
Although we incorporated only a single Monod formulation in
this study, the sediment module of AQUASIM can be used to
implement process-based sediment reaction models with more
complex kinetics (e.g., Brand et al. 2009). The AQUASIM model
can also be used to predict variation in O2 consumption path-
ways if several terminal electron acceptors which compete for
O2 are considered as parameters in the model.
Discussion
Water-side versus sediment-side—The general applicability of
each of the methods is established by the fact that differences
between method results are small relative to overall variation
in JO2 and δDBL. Although some deviation between water- and
sediment-side estimates was observed, trends in JO2 and δDBL
were sufficiently captured by both water- and sediment-side
methods (Figs. 2 and 3). Nevertheless, this deviation warrants
further evaluation. As previously mentioned, water-side meth-
ods yielded comparable but consistently higher JO2 and corre-
spondingly lower δDBL than sediment-side methods (differ-
ences of 1.8 mmol m–2 d–1 [25%] and 0.4 mm [35%] on
average, respectively). Our results are comparable to those
obtained in a study of total and diffusive O2 uptake in marine
sediment by Rabouille et al. (2003), which found that while
total O2 uptake was in close agreement with JO2 based on the
interface gradient (direct method), PROFILE-predicted (zonefit
method) JO2 was 20% less. Relative to the differences observed
between our water- and sediment-side results, variation is
much smaller within the water-side group (±7%) and the sed-
iment-side group (±10%) as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 3. Devi-
ation between water- and sediment-side estimates occurs
throughout the full data set for our 12-h experiment with no
evident correlation to turbulence and corresponding u* (Table
2; Fig. 2). SWI identification, methodological issues, assump-
tions made on sediment properties, and localized sediment O2
transport and consumption processes may have contributed
to the difference in water- and sediment-side estimates.
Estimation of the SWI location is not trivial and may have
influenced both water- and sediment-side results. Whereas the
u* method evaluates the water O2 profile up to several mm
above the SWI and the zonefit and model methods assess the
full porewater O2 profile, the direct and curvefit methods are
focused immediately on changes in (∂C/∂z)w and (∂C/∂z)s at
the SWI and are thus much more sensitive to the SWI location
(Rabouille et al. 2003). If, for example, the actual SWI location
was higher than estimated, (∂C/∂z)s would have been underes-
timated and (∂C/∂z)w overestimated in some profiles.

Water-side estimates obtained via the direct method could
have been influenced by difficulties associated with quantify-
ing δDBL directly from O2 profiles. Recent work has suggested
that it is inadequate to classify the DBL as quiescent because
δDBL varies continuously as a function of BBL currents (Røy et
al. 2004; O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). Brand et al. (2009),
however, showed that the use of a quiescent DBL is a valid
model for the study of O2 dynamics over time scales of several
minutes to hours (i.e., the 8-h seiche cycle inducing variations
in turbulence observed during this study) and that high-fre-

quency fluctuations have no significant effect on time-aver-
aged flux. Although no defined trends were observed between
turbulence and deviation in direct and u* method results, con-
ceptual issues with quantifying e and u* during low turbulence
conditions may also have been a factor.
Equipment-induced modification of hydrodynamics likely
had a minimal effect on observed variation in water- and sedi-
ment-side estimates. The open structure of the microprofiler
frame was designed to have negligible influence on hydrody-
namics, and the ADV was located several meters away from the
microprofiler. Microsensor compression of the DBL, which has
been attributed to flow acceleration around the electrode shaft
(Glud et al. 1994; Glud 2008), may have affected mea-
surements. Although changes in our series of sediment O2 pro-
files due to profiling in the same location were not discerned
(as discussed in “Materials and procedures”), repeated profiling
and subsequent localized changes in sediment properties (e.g.,
ϕ variations, creation of oxic channels) and reaction rates
could affect sediment-side JO2, particularly in systems with
lower ϕ (e.g., biofilms, highly cohesive sediment), longer O2
residence times, and/or when using larger-diameter sensors.
Sediment O2 transport processes were defined for sediment-
side methods using experimentally obtained and/or assumed
parameters (e.g., ϕ and biodiffusivity, respectively). The rela-
tively high degree of uncertainty in these sediment parameters
(P. Berg, pers. comm.) and subsequent effects on JO2 and δDBL
estimations (discussed below) could have been a source of devi-
ation between water- and sediment-side results. Quantifying
diffusive transport and the relationship between ϕ and Ds in
sediment is complicated by the heterogeneous nature of typi-
cal sediment matrices (Glud 2008). Previous work has shown
that the influence of tortuosity on diffusion may be negligible
in freshwater sediment, particularly near the SWI where ϕ
approaches unity (Maerki et al. 2004). Our measured sediment
ϕ was ≥0.95 in the upper sediment, and only slight changes in
O2 profile slope were evident at the SWI. For these reasons, we
did not correct for tortuosity in curvefit and model method
analyses in Bryant et al. (2010). PROFILE (zonefit method),
however, requires tortuosity to be defined via input parameter
Ds. To maintain consistency when evaluating the methods, Ds
(which we parameterized as Ds = ϕD) was incorporated into all
sediment-side analyses in this comparative study. Of the three
possible Ds parameterizations defined in PROFILE (Berg et al.
1998) and also relative to other published Ds definitions for
cohesive sediment (Glud 2008), this parameterization mini-
mized tortuosity effects. Accounting for tortuosity in all sedi-
ment-side analyses changed results by a factor of ϕ2 or ~5%
(with ϕ = 0.95), which directly reflects the additional influence
of ϕ due to the tortuosity correction (ϕDs = ϕ2D = 0.90D per Eq.
2 compared with ϕD = 0.95D per Bryant et al. 2010). Using a
higher-order correction for tortuosity would affect results to an
even greater extent (e.g., Ds = ϕ2D would decrease JO2 by a fac-

aTime-averaged δDBL and JO2 (characterizing the O2 profile series) used for comparative assessment are based on data obtained during active turbulence
(thus excluding profiles 8 and 9). However, including data from the quiescent period typically affected average JO2 and δDBL comparisons by <5%. Out-
lier profile 1 data also excluded.

tor of ϕ3 or 10%), which highlights the sensitivity of these
analyses to sediment property parameterization.
To further equate method comparisons and simplify
assumptions made for unknown input parameters, bioturba-
tion and irrigation effects were assumed to be negligible. How-
ever, bioturbation (i.e., the mixing of solutes and solids in sed-
iment due to fauna movement; Berg et al. 2001) has been
shown to increase JO2 estimates by up to 85% based on total
sediment O2 uptake in marine sediment (Glud 2008).
Enhanced O2 flux into the sediment due to these processes
would not have been accounted for in JO2 estimates based
solely on diffusive transport (as our results were; Eq. 2). Chi-
ronomidae sp. and Oligochaeta sp. were found in sediment cores
obtained from our experiment site (data not shown), and bio-
turbators have also been observed in similar systems (e.g.,
Lake Sempach; Bürgi and Stadelmann 2002). To investigate
the influence of bioturbation (characterized via biodiffusivity,
Db), we performed a follow-up analysis using PROFILE that
evaluated Db required to estimate JO2 equivalent to water-side
JO2. Average JO2 initially predicted by PROFILE via the zonefit
method was 5.5 mmol m2 d–1 (input Db = 0 m2 s–1). By chang-
ing the Db value used to model our O2 porewater data, we
found that a Db of 5.0 × 10–10 m2 s–1 increased JO2 to the aver-
age water-side JO2 value (6.9 mmol m2 d–1; Table 2). These
results are similar to work by Berg et al. (2001), who showed
that including bioturbation in their O2 flux evaluation caused
JO2 to increase from 4.1 mmol m–2 d–1 (Db = 0 m2 s–1) to 6.5
mmol m–2 d–1 (Db = 4.6 × 10–10 m2 s–1). Uncertainties in assumed
sediment parameters could therefore have contributed to dif-
fering sediment- and water-side results.
In addition to difficulties associated with defining bulk sed-
iment properties, sediment-side evaluations of JO2 may be
complicated by localized sediment O2 transport and con-
sumption processes that may not be accurately characterized
by O2 porewater data. Variable sediment microtopography
effects, bioturbation, and irrigation can have site-specific
effects on diffusive O2 transport (Jørgensen and Des Marais
1990; Røy et al. 2002; Rabouille et al. 2003). Small-scale het-
erogeneity in mineralization of newly deposited organic mat-
ter at the sediment surface (Zhang et al. 1999; Lewandowski et
al. 2002) and O2 consumption via benthic fauna (Krantzberg
1985; Polerecky et al. 2006; Lewandowski et al. 2007) can also
cause localized variation in sediment O2 uptake. Glud et al.
(2009) have shown that small-scale disparities in labile organic
matter distribution can result in significant variability in sur-
face sediment O2 concentrations and localized “hot spots” of
benthic O2 consumption.
The effect of spatially heterogeneous O2 uptake would not
have been accurately characterized by microsensor porewater
measurements if localized O2 uptake within the sediment
occurred near but did not directly influence the O2 micropro-
file site (Brand et al. 2008). Water-side estimates remain rela-
tively unaffected by small-scale variation in site-specific sedi-
ment processes owing to the homogenizing effect of
turbulence on Cbulk and O2 levels in the DBL (e.g., the spatial
scale of averaging within the BBL for an 8-h seiche with a flow
of 3 cm s–1 is ~1 km; within the DBL, an average flow of 1 cm
s–1 and O2 residence time of 10 min would influence a scale of
~6 m). Water-side estimates may therefore be more represen-
tative of a larger areal “footprint” than sediment-side esti-
mates (Berg et al. 2007b; O’Connor and Hondzo 2008). If con-
siderable localized sediment O2 uptake processes were
occurring near our O2 microsensor but were not captured in
profile data, then JO2 estimates based on water-column data
would be higher than site-specific, porewater-based JO2. Our
sediment O2 profiles are parabolic in shape with no kinks or
shifts in the curvature (Jørgensen and Revsbech 1985), and
deviation between water- and sediment-side JO2 estimates is
relatively small, indicating that the influence of localized O2
uptake processes on the vertical O2 distribution was likely
insignificant.
The eddy correlation method has proven to be a viable and
noninvasive approach for estimating total O2 flux that does
not disturb in situ conditions (hydrodynamic or sediment)
and is not influenced by localized O2 consumption processes
(Berg et al. 2003; Brand et al. 2008; Lorrai et al. 2010).
Although we did attempt eddy correlation measurements for
this study to compare total O2 flux to diffusive JO2 estimates,
we were unfortunately unable to obtain a quality eddy corre-
lation data set due to equipment problems.
Sediment O2 consumption—Further evaluation of porewater
O2 data provided beneficial information on O2 consumption
processes within the sediment that could not have been dis-
cerned from a water-side assessment. Because we were unable
to fully characterize the profiles using second-order polyno-
mial or exponential equations, zero- and first-order kinetic
models could not be directly applied to our data set using the
curvefit method. However, zero-order (multi-zone) and
Monod kinetic models were applied using the zonefit and
model methods, respectively. Based on these results, variations
in RO2v as a function of depth and time are shown in Fig. 6
(zonefit [PROFILE] in green; model [AQUASIM] in red). Sedi-
ment O2 consumption during turbulent periods was typically
characterized by PROFILE with two consumption zones (Fig.
6). RO2v was consistently higher in the upper region of the sed-
iment (immediately below the SWI) and decreased signifi-
cantly with depth during periods of active turbulence (e.g.,
profiles 2–5 and 11–14; Fig. 2a). Conversely, during the period
when turbulence was negligible (profiles 8 and 9), RO2v
decreased and O2 consumption was characterized by a single
zone. RO2v values based on AQUASIM-estimated Monod kinet-
ics and the corresponding regions of sediment O2 consump-
tion generally followed the same trend as the RO2v values and
zero-order O2 consumption zones predicted by PROFILE (Fig.
6). Corresponding profile-specific RO2a estimates based on zon-
efit and model method results were within ~20% on average
(data not shown). Similar characterization of sediment O2 con-
sumption by multiple kinetic models verifies results from both

methods and also emphasizes the influence that turbulence-
induced changes in O2 availability had on RO2 (Fig. 6).
Whereas zero-order kinetics are frequently used to character-
ize sediment O2 consumption independent of O2 concentra-
tion (Rasmussen and Jørgensen 1992; Jørgensen and Boudreau
2001), it has been shown that RO2v can become dependent on
O2 concentration under limiting conditions such as the rela-
tively low sediment O2 levels observed during our study
(Santschi et al. 1990; Berg et al. 2003; Bryant et al. 2010).
Our results, which show elevated O2 consumption in the
upper sediment in response to increased O2 availability at the
SWI, indicate water-side control of JO2 with the potential sedi-
ment O2 demand surpassing the amount of O2 supplied to the
sediment (O’Connor and Harvey 2008). Sediment O2 con-
sumption can alternatively be the rate-limiting step to mass
transport in physiologically active systems experiencing mod-
erate flow (Nishihara and Ackerman 2009). We observed RO2v
to decrease with depth, suggesting that RO2v may have been
dominated by mineralization of newly deposited organic mat-
ter at the sediment surface (Santschi et al. 1990; Zhang et al.
1999). Similarly, Brand et al. (2009) showed that Alpnach sed-
iment can be sufficiently modeled as a uniform layer of
organic matter with a high intrinsic capacity for O2 uptake
and transport-limited JO2. RO2v has been found to increase with
depth in environments (e.g., oligotrophic) where re-oxidation
of reduced compounds dominates O2 consumption (Glud et
al. 2007; Jørgensen and Boudreau 2001).
Comments and recommendations
Although analogous results were obtained from all five
methods, each of the methods had advantages and disadvan-
tages that may affect applicability for specific experiments.
The direct method is the least complicated, although rapid
variations in the DBL may have influenced effective δDBL esti-
mates during the ~50-min measurement period of each pro-
file. The u* method incorporates velocity as an independent
variable and provided comparable results; however, we had
difficulties in fitting the power law to the full set of profiles,
particularly for profiles exhibiting scatter in bulk O2 data.
Water-side approaches may lose validity during periods of
weak turbulence due to disintegration of the DBL and/or
insignificant u* values, but the strong correlation between LB
and δDBL estimates indicates that velocity-based estimates of
δDBL can be adequate even for low turbulence. Our results also
support the use of LB to estimate δDBL as a function of hydro-
dynamics, which is somewhat unexpected considering that e
becomes undefined during inactive periods.
As with the direct method, the curvefit method proved to
be relatively uncomplicated. Because we could not character-
ize our sediment profiles with a single curve, we essentially
applied a sediment-side version of the direct method to O2
porewater data. Although sediment ϕ and tortuosity must be
accounted for, the O2 profile immediately below the SWI may
be less variable (and thus easier to measure) than the DBL in
many environments. Therefore, the curvefit method may be
optimal as a straightforward JO2 estimation when porewater
data are available and detailed information on variation in RO2
within the sediment is not desired.
Estimates of JO2 and δDBL from the zonefit method were the
closest to average values (within 5% and 2%, respectively).
Although the zonefit and model methods were more laborious
than the other methods, significant information on how O2
consumption varied with sediment depth was obtained.
Advantages of the zonefit method include the direct analyti-
cal approach, the relative ease in which the PROFILE model
can be set up and applied, and the broad applicability of PRO-
FILE. However, PROFILE does not include dynamic processes
and thus predictions of how JO2 and other fluxes vary over
time are dependent on the number of profiles available to
characterize transient conditions. A benefit of the AQUASIM
diffusion-reaction model used for the model method is that it
can predict how the vertical O2 distribution and correspon-
ding SWI fluxes are affected by dynamic conditions (e.g., vari-
ations in δDBL; Brand et al. 2009). This is especially advanta-
geous if only a few profiles and/or proxies for δDBL (e.g., u*, e)
are available. Fortunately, we obtained a sufficient number of
profiles over a brief time period to use PROFILE to evaluate the
vertical O2 distribution and JO2 under dynamic conditions. If
our data set had not been as extensive, AQUASIM may have
been the more appropriate approach.
During this study, a direct correlation between O2 availabil-
ity in the sediment and sediment O2 consumption was
observed (as characterized by JO2 and RO2, respectively) indicat-
ing that O2 dynamics were water-side controlled in our highly-
organic, cohesive sediment. However, O’Connor et al. (2009)
showed that in porous sediment where JO2 is sediment-side
controlled, CSWI may approach Cbulk under highly turbulent
conditions. In this case, JO2 would be inaccurately estimated as
zero via Eq. 2. This highlights that the approaches evaluated in
this study are applicable only to diffusive JO2, as controlled by
the driving forces (Cbulk – CSWI) and δDBL, and would not apply
in systems dominated by advective transport.
In conclusion, by evaluating the robustness of five established
methods used to analyze JO2 and δDBL at the molecular level, we
show that estimations of these parameters are not strongly
dependent on the method chosen. Increased correlation was
observed in method results based on the same side of the SWI.
Although water-side estimates of JO2 were observed to be consis-
tently higher (and estimates of δDBL lower) than sediment-side
estimates, turbulence-induced variations in JO2 and δDBL were reli-
ably characterized by all five methods. All methods were found
to have both benefits and limitations. Water-side estimates of JO2
and δDBL typically displayed increased variability due to rapid tur-
bulent fluctuations, the influence of nondiffusive O2 uptake
processes (e.g., bioturbation), and spatial-averaging effects over a
broader area. Conversely, while sediment-side measurements
may be more robust as the sediment is frequently a less transient
environment than the BBL, accurately characterizing sediment

properties and (∂C/∂z)s, which often changes more rapidly with
depth than (∂C/∂z)w, presents additional difficulties.
Our results reveal that the effectiveness and applicability
of each of the methods depend largely on available data on
the vertical O2 distribution (e.g., data set sufficiently defin-
ing effects of dynamic conditions) and sediment properties
(e.g., ϕ and Db) and on information desired from the experi-
ment (e.g., JO2 and/or RO2). Observed variation in water- and
sediment-side estimates of JO2 does emphasize that, by focus-
ing solely on a single side of the SWI, difficulties in analyz-
ing relatively transient water-side data and/or effects of site-
specific sediment porewater data could potentially result in
significantly different interpretations of sediment-water flux.
By evaluating the vertical O2 distribution on both sides of
the SWI, a comprehensive assessment of the balance
between in situ hydrodynamic and localized sediment O2
consumption processes and the resulting JO2 and RO2 is
attained.

Hypolimnetic oxygenation systems (HOx) are increasingly used in lakes and reservoirs to
elevate dissolved oxygen (O2) while preserving stratiﬁcation, thereby decreasing concen-
trations of reduced chemical species in the hypolimnion. By maintaining an oxic zone in
the upper sediment, HOx suppress ﬂuxes of reduced soluble species from the sediment
into the overlying water. However, diminished HOx performance has been observed due to
HOx-induced increases in sediment O2 uptake. Based on a series of in situ O2 microproﬁle
and current velocity measurements, this study evaluates the vertical O2 distribution at the
sediment-water interface as a function of HOx operation. These data were used to deter-
mine how sediment O2 uptake rate (JO2) and sediment oxic-zone depth (zmax) were affected
by applied oxygen-gas ﬂow rate, changes in near-sediment mixing and O2 concentration,
and proximity to the HOx. The vertical sediment-water O2 distribution was found to be
strongly inﬂuenced by oxygenation on a reservoir-wide basis. Elevated JO2 and an oxic
sediment zone were maintained during continuous HOx operation, with zmax increasing
linearly with HOx ﬂow rate. In contrast, JO2 decreased to zero and the sediment became
anoxic as the vertical O2 distribution at the sediment-water interface collapsed during
periods when the HOx was turned off and near-sediment mixing and O2 concentrations
decreased. JO2 and zmax throughout the reservoir were found to be largely governed by HOx-
induced mixing rather than O2 levels in the water column. By quantifying how JO2 and zmax
vary in response to HOx operations, this work (1) characterizes how hypolimnetic
oxygenation affects sediment O2 dynamics, (2) contributes to the optimization of water
quality and management of HOx-equipped lakes and reservoirs, and (3) enhances under-
standing of the effect of mixing and O2 concentrations in other systems.

Introduction
Dissolved oxygen (O2) has been identiﬁed as one of the most
critical environmental factors controlling water quality and
associated ecological conditions (Hondzo et al., 2005). Aquatic
ecosystems, hydropower plants, and water quality are all
negatively affected by depleted O2 concentrations (Beutel and
Horne,
1999).
Water-quality
standards
typically
require
O2 > 150 mmol L1 to protect aquatic life (EPA, 2000). Hydro-
power plants are usually required to meet these minimum O2
levels in the water they discharge downstream (Mobley et al.,
2000a). Long-term O2 depletion in ﬁsh habitats has been
shown to cause signiﬁcant declines in ﬁsh populations as
a result of endocrine system disruptions and reproductive

impairment, with low O2 possibly having more of an effect
than anthropogenic chemicals (Wu et al., 2003). Organic or
nutrient loading of thermally stratiﬁed lakes and reservoirs
may lead to extensive depletion of O2 in the deeper hypo-
limnetic water. Hypolimnetic O2 depletion can result in the
release of soluble chemical species from the sediment,
decreasing
water
quality
and
increasing
drinking-water
treatment costs (Gantzer et al., 2009a). Oxygen depletion in
lakes and reservoirs is largely controlled by sediment O2
uptake which is regulated by near-sediment hydrodynamics
and the intrinsic sediment O2 demand (Veenstra and Nolen,
1991; O’Connor et al., 2009). Understanding the processes
controlling the sediment O2 uptake rate (JO2) and other
sediment-water ﬂuxes is crucial for optimizing water quality
and successfully managing lakes and reservoirs (Zhang et al.,
1999; Beutel, 2003).
Hypolimnetic
oxygenation
systems
(HOx)
are
used
increasingly by drinking water and hydropower utilities to
replenish O2 and decrease concentrations of soluble metals,
such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), and other chemical
species
in
source
water
while
preserving
stratiﬁcation
(McGinnis and Little, 2002; Beutel et al., 2007; Gantzer et al.,
2009b). While several types of systems are used for hypo-
limnetic oxygenation (Singleton and Little, 2006; Moore and
Christensen, 2009), this study is based on the performance
of a bubble-plume diffuser HOx. Bubble-plume HOx release
oxygen gas from diffusers positioned near the reservoir
bottom and impart relatively low levels of mixing within the
hypolimnion to maintain overall thermal structure. These
HOx thereby increase hypolimnetic O2 concentrations while
suppressing mixing of the epilimnion and hypolimnion and
preventing destratiﬁcation (Wu¨ est et al., 1992; McGinnis et al.,
2004). Ideally, an HOx increases O2 availability both in the
water column and in the upper sediment to prevent the
release of reduced chemicals into the hypolimnion (Zaw and
Chiswell,
1999;
Beutel
2003).
The
balance
between
the
amount of O2 supplied to the sediment via JO2 and the amount
consumed via various sediment biogeochemical processes
(e.g., benthic mineralization of organic matter and oxidation
of reduced chemicals) governs sediment oxic-zone depth
(zmax)
and
sediment O2
availability
(Glud
et
al.,
2007).
Oxygenation may, however, cause excessive O2 uptake in the
hypolimnion and sediment due to HOx-induced increases in
hypolimnetic O2 concentrations and turbulent mixing (Moore,
2003; Gantzer et al., 2009b). JO2 is a function of the O2
concentration driving force across the diffusive boundary
layer (DBL), a mm-scale laminar layer immediately above the
sediment-water interface (SWI; Jørgensen and Revsbech,
1985). Turbulence in the overlying water governs DBL thick-
ness (dDBL; Lorke et al., 2003; Bryant et al., 2010a) and hence
directly affects JO2.
Despite the potential inﬂuence that HOx may have on
sediment O2 uptake, reservoir-speciﬁc JO2 measurements are
rarely available and HOx are often designed based on O2
depletion rates measured prior to installation of the systems
(Moore et al., 1996; Mobley et al., 2000b; Beutel et al., 2007).
While
the
relationship
between
near-sediment
current
velocity and JO2
has been investigated (Gundersen and
Jorgensen, 1990; Mackenthun and Stefan, 1998), little work
has been done to quantify how HOx operations affect JO2 and
the vertical distribution of O2 at the SWI. Most studies per-
formed have been laboratory based (Moore et al., 1996; Beutel,
2003). However, it has been shown that JO2 can be signiﬁcantly
affected by variations in natural turbulence (Lorke et al., 2003;
Bryant et al., 2010a) and laboratory studies may not capture
actual HOx-driven conditions. The research presented here is
therefore based on in situ O2 sediment-water microproﬁles
and near-sediment current velocity to address ﬁve key themes
related to the inﬂuence of HOx on sediment O2 uptake. This
study characterizes how (1) the vertical O2 distribution at the
SWI and (2) sediment O2 dynamics (quantiﬁed by JO2) are
affected by HOx operations in a drinking-water-supply reser-
voir. It also evaluates (3) the sediment oxic zone (quantiﬁed by
zmax) as a function of HOx oxygen-gas ﬂow rate and (4) spatial
variation in the inﬂuence of the HOx. Finally, (5) broader
impacts on reservoir water quality are assessed. Focus is ﬁrst
placed on a multi-day in situ campaign that shows how JO2
and the vertical O2 distribution at the SWI respond to turning
the HOx off for w48 h and then back on. Building on these
results, a multi-year data set is then used to quantify the
inﬂuence of HOx on sediment O2 conditions using a broader
range of ﬂow rates. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study to assess in situ how HOx-induced variation in near-
sediment mixing and O2 concentrations inﬂuence JO2 and
the sediment oxic zone on a reservoir-wide scale.

Materials and methods
2.1.
Study site
This research focused on Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR), which
is managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority to provide
drinking water to the county of Roanoke, Virginia, USA. CCR is
a stream-fed lake that has been managed as a drinking-water-
supply reservoir since the late 1940s. CCR is eutrophic and has
a maximum depth of 23 m, width of w600 m, and length of
w8000 m (Fig. 1). In 2005, a bubble-plume line diffuser HOx was
installed in the deepest section of the reservoir near the water
treatment plant withdrawal (Fig. 1) to replenish O2 depleted
during summer stratiﬁcation and to minimize soluble Fe and
Mn in the source water (McGinnis and Little, 2002; Gantzer
et al., 2009a). The CCR HOx delivers pure oxygen gas over
a wide range of ﬂow rates, providing considerable operational
ﬂexibility. Thus, it was possible to vary O2 and artiﬁcially-
induced mixing in the reservoir by changing the applied HOx
ﬂow rate. Data were collected from 2005 through 2008 to assess
how the HOx affects CCR, with substantial improvement in
water quality observed since HOx operations began (Gantzer
et al., 2009a,b). Research presented here on HOx-induced
variation in the vertical O2 distribution at the SWI extends
the work of Gantzer et al. (2009a,b), which focused on water-
column conditions, by evaluating the inﬂuence of HOx on
sediment O2 dynamics and the sediment oxic zone.
2.2.
Data collection and analysis
This study is based on in situ data obtained during ﬁeld
campaigns using a microproﬁler (MP4; Unisense A/S) to obtain
proﬁles at the SWI and an acoustic Doppler current proﬁler

(ADCP; Teledyne RDI, Inc.) for current velocities in the water
column. During the primary ﬁeld campaign in 2008, HOx ﬂow
was typically maintained at 51 m3 h1 (or w1580 kg O2 d1).
However, the HOx was turned off for w48 h during two
experimental campaigns (each w1e2 weeks in duration) in
June and August 2008 to track the response of the vertical O2
distribution at the SWI and corresponding JO2. The relatively
short period that the HOx was turned off was planned to
preserve reservoir water quality by minimizing effects on
hypolimnetic O2 levels. Previous work by Gantzer et al. (2009b)
showed that turning the HOx off for a longer period (e.g.,
several weeks) can impair water quality substantially due to
the accumulation of reduced compounds as the hypolimnion
becomes hypoxic.
During the ﬁrst campaign, the MP4 microproﬁler and ADCP
were deployed alongside the HOx at site CCR-2 (Fig. 1) from
June 19 to 26. The HOx was turned off from June 19 to 21. Data
were downloaded and batteries for the MP4 and the ADCP
were exchanged daily. A similar campaign was performed in
August at the mid-reservoir site CCR-6, w1000 m upstream of
the end of the HOx, and data were collected almost continu-
ously from August 18 to 30. The HOx was turned off from
August 19 to 21. While analogous results were obtained from
both campaigns, reported results are based largely on the
August CCR-6 campaign due to insufﬁcient background data
for the June CCR-2 campaign.
In addition to these multi-day campaigns, MP4 and ADCP
data were collected monthly from June to September 2008 at
CCR-2, CCR-6, and CCR-7 (located w2000 m upstream of the
end of the HOx; Fig. 1). During May to August 2007, monthly
MP4 microproﬁle measurements were also obtained down-
stream, alongside, and 1000 m upstream of the HOx at sites
CCR-1, CCR-2, and CCR-6, respectively, while the HOx was
operated at four different oxygen-gas ﬂow rates increased
incrementally on a monthly basis from 17 to 70 m3 h1. Each
day that O2 microproﬁle measurements were obtained,
conductivity, temperature, and O2 as a function of depth (CTD)
proﬁles of the water column were measured at each sampling
location using a Seabird Electronics SBE 19plus proﬁler. The
SBE 19plus has a 4-Hz sampling rate and an O2 sensor
response time of 1.4 s.
2.2.1.
O2 microproﬁles
The in situ autonomous MP4 microproﬁler equipped with
microsensors (O2 and temperature) was used to obtain
microproﬁles at the SWI. The O2 microsensor (OX-100; Uni-
sense A/S) had a 100-mm tip diameter and depth resolution,
fast response time (90% in <8 s), and negligible stirring sensi-
tivity. The O2 microsensor was a Clark-type sensor with an
internal reference and guard cathode. The temperature
microsensor (TP-100; Unisense A/S) was a thermo-coupled
sensor with a tip diameter and depth resolution of w200 mm,
measurement resolution of 0.1 mV per C, and a 90% response
time of <3 s. Proﬁles were measured nearly continuously
(exceptions include while data were downloaded and a period
on August 26e27 when a storm prevented use of the boat to
download data) during the multi-day campaigns and obtained
in duplicate at each CCR sampling location during monthly
measurements. Proﬁles were obtained as follows: 10-mm
resolution from 10 cm to 1 cm above the SWI, 1-mm resolution
from 1 cm to 0.5 cm above the SWI, and 0.1-mm resolution
from 0.5 cm above the SWI to 0.5 cm below the SWI. The SWI
location was determined as described by Bryant et al. (2010a,b).
A video camera was used periodically to ensure that the MP4
remained stable and did not sink. Ten measurements were
typically taken at each depth. For the multi-day campaigns,
however, three measurements were obtained per depth due to
data-storage
limitations
during
overnight
deployments.
Following a pause between measurements for equilibrium to
be established at each depth, microsensor data were collected
at a rate of 1 Hz. Time required to obtain a full proﬁle was
w50e70 min and proﬁles are referenced by the time when the
microsensor encountered the SWI. A two-point, linear cali-
bration of the O2 microsensor was performed using zero
readings from anoxic sediment and Winkler titration of water
sampled immediately above the sediment using a Kemmerer
bottle and/or sediment cores. zmax was designated as the depth
where O2 drops to <3 mmol L1.
2.2.2.
Current velocity
Velocity proﬁles were collected using a 1200 kHz Workhorse
Rio Grande ADCP equipped with four transducers in a janus
conﬁguration with a beam angle of 20. The ADCP, positioned
adrift alongside the research vessel and facing downward
from the water surface, proﬁled the water-column depth
using a 1-m bin size. Samples were obtained in a multi-ping
mode with 50 samples per ensemble at a rate of 2 Hz. Accu-
racy of velocity measurements was 0.25% of water-plus-boat

was measured using bottom tracking. The boat remained
stationary during measurements and boat velocity was
negligible. Near-sediment velocities were of primary interest;
however, the ADCP has a blanking distance near the sediment
due to interference from the angled acoustic beams reﬂecting
off the sediment surface, thereby contaminating the acoustic
signal returned to the ADCP. The near-sediment blank zone is
w6% of the total water-column depth, as deﬁned by RDI, or
approximately the bottom 1 m in CCR. Hence, near-sediment
velocities were evaluated at w2 m above the sediment.

evaluate 4 following Dalsgaard et al. (2000) and 4 values of
0.95e0.97 were obtained for the upper 1 cm of sediment.
Values for D were based on D ¼ 1.97  109 m2 s1 at 20 C,
correcting for temperature using the Stokes-Einstein rela-
tionship (Li and Gregory, 1974; Arega and Lee, 2005). Ds was
deﬁned as Ds ¼ 4D to correct for sediment tortuosity as
a function of 4 (Berg et al., 1998; Glud, 2008; Bryant et al.,
2010b). The temporal change in O2 concentration (vC/vt) was
evaluated for the series of in situ O2 proﬁles by comparing
proﬁles immediately before and after one another and calcu-
lating the rate of change in O2 at each depth. vC/vt was found
to be on average <5% of JO2, establishing that measured
proﬁles were at quasi-steady state.
Fick’s law may be applied to either water- or sediment-side
data to evaluate JO2 and dDBL (Rasmussen and Jørgensen, 1992;
Bryant et al., 2010a,b). Diffusive transport in the sediment is
given by the second term in Eq. (1) and in the water by the
third and fourth terms. JO2 was evaluated as a function of (vC/
vz)sed from sediment O2 porewater data using the second term
in Eq. (1). Because JO2 estimates were based on porewater data,
water-side data were used for dDBL estimates to allow for an
independent comparison with JO2. Water-side dDBL was esti-
mated as a function of the measured (vC/vz)water in the DBL
using the third and fourth terms in Eq. (1).
2.2.4.
Turbulence estimations
Turbulence has been shown by Lorke et al. (2003) to have
a more direct inﬂuence on dDBL and JO2 estimates than current
velocity. Turbulence is characterized by the dissipation rate of
turbulent kinetic energy, e (W kg1), which is frequently esti-
mated by applying the inertial dissipation method (Grant
et al., 1962) to near-sediment velocity data, as performed by
Bryant et al. (2010a) and Lorke et al. (2003) using acoustic
Doppler velocimeter (ADV) data measured at 10 cm and 1 m
above the sediment, respectively. However, as discussed in
Section 2.2.2, obtaining near-sediment velocity measure-
ments was restricted by the limited accuracy of the ADCP
approaching the sediment. Estimates of velocity at w2 m
above the sediment are thus a relative measure of near-
sediment mixing conditions. To quantify turbulence levels
in the absence of more precise near-sediment velocity data,
a correlation between dDBL, the viscous boundary layer (the
cm-scale region immediately above the DBL), and friction
velocity (u*) was used to estimate e. According to Wu¨ est and
Lorke (2003), dDBL and viscous boundary layer thickness (dn)
are related by:
dDBL ¼ dv
D
v
1=3
½m
(2)
where v is the kinematic viscosity of water (m2 s1). In turn, dv
is deﬁned as a function of u* (Schlichting, 2000) via:
dv ¼ 11v
u
½m
(3)
Combining Eqs. (2) and (3) allows u* to be related to dDBL:
u ¼

(4)
The u* values estimate the frictional stress of currents on
the sediment and, similar to e, characterize near-sediment
turbulence. Estimated u* values obtained via Eq. (4) were
used to calculate e using the law-of-the-wall assumption
(Lorke et al., 2003):
e ¼ u3


(5)
where k (the von Karman constant) is 0.41 and h is height
above the sediment. For these estimates, e was evaluated at an
assumed h ¼ 10 cm to obtain near-sediment e predictions and
to allow for direct comparison with e based on ADV data
measured in a similar system at h ¼ 10 cm (Bryant et al.,
2010a). This comparison veriﬁed that e estimates for this
study were typical for a freshwater lake.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Vertical O2 distribution at SWI
Substantial variation in the vertical O2 distribution on both
sides of the SWI was observed in response to halting oxygen
ﬂow for w48 h during the 2008 campaigns. Proﬁles (each of
w50 min duration) were collected almost continuously over
the course of both multi-day campaigns in 2008. A summary
of proﬁle results during the August CCR-6 campaign is pre-
sented in Fig. 2. Prior to the point at which the HOx was turned
off on August 19 at w15:00, O2 concentrations were relatively
high both in the water immediately above the sediment
(w125
mmol
L1)
and
within
the
sediment
porewater
(w80 mmol L1 at the SWI with zmax of 0.8 mm; Fig. 2a). A
constant Cbulk and a well-deﬁned DBL are also evident,

signifying active near-sediment turbulence. However, as
indicated by the 17:39 proﬁle, O2 started to become depleted
from the sediment and overlying water within a few hours of
turning the HOx off (Fig. 2b). Approximately 5 h after halting
oxygenation, the sediment and overlying water had become
completely anoxic (proﬁle 20:02). A transient oxic period
occurred on August 21 (proﬁles 15:11, 15:58; Fig. 2c) when
near-sediment O2 and zmax increased immediately after HOx
operation resumed, which may be attributed to a large
internal wave induced by turning on the HOx. Excluding this
brief period, however, conditions remained almost completely
anoxic until August 29 (Fig. 2c,d). A relatively rapid increase in
O2 is then observed on both sides of the SWI, with the vertical
O2 distribution returning to a structure similar to that at the
beginning of the campaign (Fig. 2a).
Contour plots using a Kriging interpolation scheme were
created based on the full 255-proﬁle series of O2 microproﬁle
data obtained during the August CCR-6 campaign, background
microproﬁles, and corresponding CTD hypolimnetic O2 data
(Fig. 3). While O2 concentrations near the SWI changed
substantially in response to turning off the HOx for w48 h
(Fig. 3a), O2 remained relatively constant (w200 mmol L1) at
8 cm above the sediment (Fig. 3b) and the bulk water column
was affected negligibly (Fig. 3c). The fact that O2 in the over-
lying water remained largely unaffected while the sediment
became anoxic emphasizes how sediment O2 uptake depends
on continual operation of the HOx.
Although the HOx was turned off for only w48 h, it took w8
days for the vertical O2 distribution at the SWI to be restored
during the August CCR-6 campaign (Figs. 2c,d and 3a). This
delayed response may be attributed both to time required for
a
uniform
ﬂow
pattern
in
the
hypolimnion
to
be
re-
established and to localized sediment resuspension effects
(discussed further in Section 3.4). During a six-year study in an
HOx-equipped reservoir similar to CCR, it was observed that it
typically took w1 week for ‘steady-state’ O2 conditions to
return in the water column after resuming oxygenation, with
substantially higher initial O2 depletion rates in the hypo-
limnion (Gantzer, 2002; Gantzer et al., 2009a).
The considerable inﬂuence that HOx operations had on the
vertical sediment-water O2 distribution mid-reservoir at CCR-
6 (Figs. 2 and 3) was also evident in the near ﬁeld at CCR-2
(Fig. 4). A strong correlation was found between HOx opera-
tion and parameters quantifying the vertical O2 distribution
(O2 at 5 cm above the sediment (C5), CSWI, and zmax) during
both the June and August 2008 campaigns. At CCR-6, as CSWI
dropped from w80 to 0 mmol L1 and C5 decreased from w200
to 50 mmol L1 after turning off the HOx on August 19, zmax also
rapidly decreased from 1 to 0 mm as O2 was depleted from the
sediment (Fig. 4a). Apart from the brief oxic period on August
21 after the HOx was turned back on, sediment porewater and
the SWI remained anoxic and C5 remained low until August 29

(w12:00). Proﬁle data obtained prior to turning the HOx off
are shown in (a). Proﬁles characterizing the periods when

when oxic sediment conditions were re-established. Similar
results were observed at CCR-2 after turning off the HOx on
June 19 as CSWI and C5 both dropped to 0 mmol L1 and zmax
decreased from 0.5 to 0 mm (Fig. 4b). The response time for the
re-establishment of an oxic sediment-water O2 distribution
was also delayed at CCR-2, taking w5 days. A transient oxic
period after resuming oxygenation was not observed at CCR-2
perhaps due to enhanced sediment resuspension in this near-
ﬁeld region after turning on the HOx (discussed in Section 3.4).
Due to equipment issues and the fact that O2 depletion
occurred more rapidly than expected following the halt of HOx
operation, data characterizing the initial O2 depletion phase
were not obtained during the preliminary June campaign
(Fig. 4b). Data measured before and after each multi-day
campaign
(e.g.,
August
12
and
September
14;
Fig.
4a)
compare well with average CSWI and zmax values during
normal continuous HOx operation (CSWI ¼ 94  38 mmol L1
and zmax ¼ 1.4  0.6 mm at CCR-6 (n ¼ 22) and 61  45 mmol L1
and 0.7  0.4 mm (n ¼ 15) at CCR-2).
3.2.
HOx-induced variation in sediment O2 dynamics
While HOx are designed to remediate problems caused by
hypolimnetic
O2
depletion,
conceptually
these
systems
should also increase sediment O2 uptake via enhanced O2 ﬂux
into the sediment due to an elevated O2 concentration driving
force at the SWI and suppression of the DBL resulting from
increased O2 and turbulence levels, respectively, in the lower
hypolimnion (Eq. (1); Bryant et al., 2010a,b). Sediment O2
dynamics (as characterized by JO2) and water-side controls on
diffusive ﬂux (as characterized by CSWI and dDBL) were affected
considerably by HOx operations, as shown by CCR-6 data in
Fig. 5a. During ongoing oxygenation, dDBL was suppressed
while JO2 and CSWI remained elevated. Average summer JO2
and dDBL at CCR-6 were 12.5  7.6 mmol m2 d1 and
1.6  0.9 mm (n ¼ 22), respectively. However, in response to
turning off the HOx on August 19, dDBL increased from 0.6 mm
to the point of becoming undeﬁned (Fig. 5a; no discernable
DBL was measurable at dDBL >5 mm; hence, a nominal
maximum dDBL ¼ 5 mm was assumed). Simultaneously, JO2
decreased from 12.5 to 0 mmol m2 d1 and CSWI dropped from
w80 to 0 mmol L1 as diffusive transport of O2 was restricted
and O2 was depleted from the sediment. Per Eq. (1), as dDBL
increases to the point of becoming undeﬁned in the absence of
turbulent mixing and the O2 concentration driving force
Fig. 4 e Variations in O2 concentrations at the SWI (CSWI), at
5 cm above the SWI (C5), and within the sediment (as
characterized by sediment oxic-zone depth zmax) in
response to turning off the HOx. Similar trends are
observed in data from (a) the August 2008 campaign at
CCR-6 and also (b) the June 2008 campaign at CCR-2. During
the period of zero ﬂow when the HOx was not in operation,
O2 concentrations dropped both at 5 cm above and directly
at the SWI and the sediment became anoxic as O2 was
depleted.
Fig. 5 e The response of JO2 and water-side parameters
inﬂuencing diffusive ﬂux (a; diffusive boundary layer
thickness (dDBL) and CSWI) to turning off the HOx
corresponds directly to variations in near-sediment mixing
(b) as characterized by current velocity at 2 m above the
sediment (obtained via ADCP), turbulence (deﬁned by
energy dissipation rate (e) estimated as a function of water-
side dDBL), and temperature at the SWI (obtained via MP4
temperature microsensor). Results shown are based on in
situ data obtained during the August 2008 campaign at
CCR-6; similar results were obtained from the June CCR-2
campaign. Data in Fig. 5 are average bi-daily values
(standard deviation data provided in Table 1). The period
during which the HOx was turned off is designated by the
shaded region.

becomes negligible when the sediment and overlying water
are anoxic, JO2 goes to zero. Analogous to O2 data presented in
Figs. 2c and 4a, JO2 and CSWI increased and dDBL decreased
brieﬂy after the HOx was turned back on (Fig. 5a, Table 1).
However, JO2 and CSWI remained at approximately zero until
August 29 when a steady-state ﬂow pattern and oxic condi-
tions at the SWI returned. As a well-deﬁned and thinner DBL
was re-established and diffusive O2 transport to the sediment
resumed by August 29, CSWI increased to w70 mmol L1 and JO2
increased to w15 mmol m2 d1 (Fig. 5a, Table 1). Average bi-
daily values are shown in Fig. 5 with standard deviations
provided in Table 1 (variation in e not provided as this
parameter is directly related to dDBL).
The response of JO2 and the water-side vertical O2 distri-
bution to HOx operations (Fig. 5a) closely parallels variation in
near-sediment current velocity (as measured by ADCP), esti-
mated turbulence levels (as characterized by e), and temper-
ature at the SWI (as measured by temperature microsensor;
Fig. 5b). Velocities at 2 m above the sediment dropped sharply
soon after the HOx was turned off. After the HOx was turned
back on, near-sediment velocities are observed to increase
though they remained quite variable. Velocities returned to
pre-campaign levels (w5 cm s1; summer average was
6.2 cm s1) on August 29, which corresponds with the timing
of the re-established vertical O2 structure at the SWI (Figs. 2
and 4). Near-sediment velocity is shown to strongly correlate
with e, both of which decreased considerably when the HOx
was turned off (Fig. 5b). The correlation between ADCP
velocity data and estimated e values, which are based on O2
microproﬁle data, supports the evaluation of e as a function of
dDBL and highlights the inﬂuence of mixing on dDBL. Estimates
of dDBL-based e for this study are within the same range as
ADV-based e values obtained by Bryant et al. (2010a) for wind-
induced mixing (i.e., seiching) in a freshwater lake. HOx-
induced mixing, which has been shown to result in elevated
temperatures in the hypolimnion (Gantzer et al., 2009b;
Liboriussen et al., 2009), is further conﬁrmed by variations in
temperature at the SWI that closely follow trends in e and
current velocity (Fig. 5b). A peak in current velocity, e, and
temperature on August 21 corresponds to the oxic vertical O2
distribution, decreased dDBL, and elevated JO2 observed brieﬂy
at this time (Figs. 4a and 5) and supports the occurrence of
a large internal wave following HOx start-up. These results
reveal the controlling inﬂuence that HOx operation can have
on the degree of mixing in the hypolimnion (Fig. 5b) and cor-
responding sediment O2 uptake (Fig. 5a).
O2 concentrations in the lower hypolimnion remained
largely unaffected by halting oxygenation (Fig. 3) with O2
levels staying relatively high only w8 cm above the sediment.
Despite these high O2 concentrations, as near-sediment mix-
ing decreased, dDBL increased, JO2 and CSWI decreased to zero,
and the sediment and overlying water became anoxic (Figs. 3

ﬂow rate during the August 2008 CCR-6 campaign. Average values for JO2, CSWI, temperature, and dDBL (based on
microsensor data) were estimated using the number (n) of proﬁles obtained during the designated time period.

and 5). The signiﬁcant role that HOx-induced turbulent mixing
plays in driving oxygenated water down to the SWI and
facilitating JO2 is thus clearly demonstrated. Brand et al. (2009)
and Bryant et al. (2010a) similarly showed that turbulence
from seiching was a controlling factor in maintaining oxic
sediment conditions regardless of O2 concentrations only
a few cm above the SWI.
The inﬂuence of seiching on sediment O2 uptake (Bryant
et al., 2010a) was expected to be minimal in CCR due to rela-
tively mild average wind speeds and irregular basin bathym-
etry (Fig. 1). Wind speed (based on National Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data for the Roa-
noke airport, located w5 km from CCR) was assessed to
determine if seiching was an inﬂuence in observed changes in
current velocity (NOAA, 2008). As anticipated, a correlation
between average wind speed and current velocities (near-
sediment, mid-hypolimnion, and mid-epilimnion; data not
shown) was not observed which conﬁrms that seiche-induced
turbulence was not a signiﬁcant factor in sediment-water O2
dynamics in CCR.
3.3.
Correlation between zmax and HOx gas ﬂow
While induced JO2 can be problematic if not properly accoun-
ted for in HOx design and operation, increased JO2 is beneﬁcial
if an enhanced sediment oxic zone inhibits the transport of
reduced soluble species into the water column (Lin et al., 2003;
Beutel et al., 2007; Gantzer et al., 2009a). To evaluate the rela-
tionship between HOx ﬂow rate and zmax, additional data from
summer 2007 were used to cover a broader range of ﬂow rates.
The 2008 off/on HOx experiments revealed that zmax and the
sediment O2 distribution responded directly to changes in HOx
operation based on the ﬂow rates of 0 and 51 m3 h1 (Fig. 4).
These results were expanded upon by including O2 micro-
proﬁle data obtained at CCR-2 and CCR-6 while the HOx was
operated at ﬁve different ﬂow rates during 2007e2008 (Fig. 6).
The sediment oxic zone (quantiﬁed by zmax) was found to
be linearly related to HOx ﬂow rate in both the near ﬁeld and
mid-reservoir region, with zmax increasing in accordance with
ﬂow rate (Fig. 6) and a P-value of 0.04 for CCR-2 and CCR-6
data. The response of zmax to increased ﬂow rate was similar
in both regions, although zmax was slightly lower near the HOx
(CCR-2) than further upstream (CCR-6). Conversely, average
JO2 values were comparable but higher at CCR-2 than at CCR-6
(13.6  7.2 vs. 6.6  2.4 mmol m2 d1). These results suggest
that increased O2 reached the near-ﬁeld sediment but was
then consumed more rapidly by sediment O2 consumption
processes, resulting in decreased zmax (O’Connor et al., 2009).
CCR near-ﬁeld sediment has been found to have considerably
higher levels of total organic carbon, Fe, and Mn in the bulk
sediment (Bryant et al., unpubl.) which may result from
enhanced oxide precipitation and sediment focusing in the
deeper region where the HOx is installed (Fig. 1; Schaller and
Wehrli, 1997). Thus, sediment near the HOx most likely has
increased sources of electron acceptors and subsequently
would have a greater capacity for O2 consumption. Variations
in mixing resulting from interaction between the HOx bubble
plume and CCR bottom topography (Singleton and Little, 2006;
Singleton et al., 2010) also likely affected sediment O2 uptake.
However, the fact that fairly similar zmax values were observed
at CCR-2 and CCR-6 indicates that oxygenation maintained
a balance between sediment O2 supply and consumption
processes in both the near- and far-ﬁeld regions.
3.4.
Spatial variation in inﬂuence of HOx
The response of the vertical sediment-water O2 distribution to
halting oxygenation was found to be similar both near the
HOx at CCR-2 and mid-reservoir at CCR-6 (Fig. 4). Furthermore,
ongoing HOx operations maintained a fairly uniform sedi-
ment oxic zone throughout most of CCR (Fig. 6) and average JO2
values were comparable in both the near ﬁeld and mid-
reservoir region (Section 3.3). Results do indicate, though,
that proximity to the HOx inﬂuenced localized ﬂow patterns
and the time required for a vertical O2 distribution to be re-
established at the SWI after resuming oxygenation.
Ideally,
HOx-induced
turbulence
establishes
a
gently
mixed hypolimnion (Singleton and Little, 2006) which is sup-
ported by ADCP measurements in CCR indicating relatively
similar current velocities throughout the reservoir (data not
shown). However, short-circuiting of plume-induced ﬂow can
occur in the region near the HOx (McGinnis et al., 2004;
Singleton et al., 2010). Although the far ﬁeld is usually less
affected by the plume, HOx plume model results by Singleton
et al. (2007) showed that the area most directly inﬂuenced by
the HOx was a detrainment region between the depth of
maximum plume rise and the fallback elevation of equal
density. CCR-6 is located within this detrainment region and
may therefore be subject to more intense turbulence, while
CCR-2 is located below the fallback elevation.
As shown in Fig. 4, it took w5 days for the vertical O2
distribution to be restored at CCR-2 and w8 days at CCR-6. The
time required for suspended particles to settle in the near ﬁeld
and for HOx-induced near-sediment mixing to resume could
Fig. 6 e Variation in zmax as a function of HOx ﬂow rate. A
linear relationship between the sediment oxic zone and
HOx ﬂow is observed, with zmax increasing in response to
elevated HOx ﬂow at both locations (P-value of 0.04 for
CCR-2 and CCR-6 data). On average, 2e3 measurements
were obtained per ﬂow rate, with the exception of data
obtained during the 2008 multi-day campaigns for which
bi-daily averages were used.

have contributed to this delayed response (Figs. 4 and 5).
Sediment resuspension and the introduction of reduced
species into the hypolimnion, particularly near the HOx, likely
occur immediately after turning on the HOx (Gantzer, 2002).
Enhanced sediment resuspension at CCR-2 may have pre-
vented the brief establishment of oxic conditions as observed
at CCR-6 (Fig. 4). However, the vertical O2 distribution at the
SWI was most likely restored more quickly in the near ﬁeld due
to local mixing effects. At CCR-6, the response was more
gradual as it took longer for HOx-induced increases in O2 and
near-sediment turbulence to inﬂuence sediment O2 conditions
up-reservoir. Once an oxic vertical O2 distribution was estab-
lished, though, O2 microproﬁles measured at CCR-6 (Fig. 2)
typically maintained a more stable, well-deﬁned structure
than those at CCR-2. This may be attributed to minimal sedi-
ment disturbance and enhanced turbulence due to plume
detrainment mid-reservoir as compared to near the HOx
where sediment resuspension and localized ﬂow instabilities
are likely more prevalent (Singleton et al., 2010). Less consis-
tent conditions near the HOx are supported by increased
variation in CCR-2 data (Fig. 6) especially at high ﬂow rates.
3.5.
Effect on source water quality
While HOx operations were found to increase sediment O2
uptake (Figs. 5 and 6), an O2 balance performed on the CCR
water column by Gantzer et al. (2009b) showed that enough O2
can be supplied by the HOx to counteract this increased
demand and prevent O2 depletion within the water column.
The work presented here on sediment O2 uptake supports that
HOx can effectively replenish O2 in thermally stratiﬁed water-
supply reservoirs such as CCR as long as HOx-induced
increases in JO2 are properly accounted for. Though additional
factors like external nutrient loading may be important
(Ga¨chter and Wehrli, 1998; Liboriussen et al., 2009), previous
studies also support the substantial beneﬁts of HOx (Gemza,
1997; Prepas and Burke, 1997; Beutel et al., 2007). Furthermore,
the sediment oxic zone was found to be enhanced considerably
by oxygenation throughout most of the reservoir (Fig. 6),
thereby promoting decreased transport of reduced chemical
species to the water column. It has been shown that main-
taining oxic conditions in the upper w1e2 mm of sediment can
suppress the release of reduced chemical species from the
sediment to the hypolimnion (Jørgensen and Boudreau, 2001;
Beutel, 2003). By establishing that HOx can facilitate an oxic
sediment zone on a reservoir-wide basis, the current study
links sediment-water O2 dynamics to water-column studies
showing that oxygenation can result in signiﬁcantly improved
water quality (McGinnis et al., 2004; Gantzer et al., 2009a,b).

Conclusions
This research emphasizes the viability of using HOx to
maintain a sediment oxic zone on a reservoir-wide scale in
order to minimize reduced chemical ﬂuxes from the sediment
to the overlying water. Understanding how HOx-induced
variations in near-sediment mixing and O2 concentrations
affect diffusive transport at the SWI is crucial for accurately
quantifying JO2 and other sediment-water ﬂuxes, optimizing
water quality, and effectively managing lakes and reservoirs.
Signiﬁcant conclusions include:
1. The vertical distribution of O2 on both sides of the SWI was
strongly controlled by HOx operations. Oxic conditions at
the SWI were maintained in both the near ﬁeld and mid-
reservoir during continuous oxygenation. The inﬂuence of
the HOx on sediment O2 uptake was emphasized by the
onset of anoxia in the sediment and overlying water in
response to turning the HOx off for only w48 h.
2. Decreased dDBL and increased JO2 and zmax were observed
during oxygenation. While HOx operation increased both
near-sediment O2 concentrations and mixing, sediment O2
uptake was more strongly correlated to mixing as opposed
to O2 levels in the lower hypolimnion. Regardless of O2
concentration several cm above the sediment, turbulent
transport of oxygenated water to the sediment surface
governed the vertical O2 distribution above and below the
SWI and the corresponding JO2.
3. A linear relationship between zmax and HOx oxygen-gas
ﬂow was established, with zmax increasing with escalating
ﬂow rate.
4. Sediment response time for an oxic vertical O2 distribution
at the SWI to become re-established after initiating HOx
operations was determined to be w1 week in both the near
and far ﬁeld. However, spatial variation in the inﬂuence of
the HOx was observed as the response time was several
days longer and the vertical sediment-water O2 distribution
was more stable mid-reservoir than near the HOx.
5. Taking HOx-induced increases in JO2 into account when
designing and operating HOx is critical for enhancing
source water quality via oxygenation.
By evaluating the effect of HOx on sediment O2 uptake,
these results enable successful HOx operations that facilitate
both elevated source water O2 concentrations and an oxic
environment at the SWI. Furthermore, while this study
focused on HOx-induced changes in near-sediment mixing
and O2 concentrations, variation in these parameters can also
be induced naturally (e.g., via fall overturn, wind-induced
seiching, and hydraulic inputs during storm events). Results
should therefore be more generally applicable.

One of the primary goals of hypolimnetic oxygenation systems (HOx) from a drinking water
perspective is to suppress sediment-water ﬂuxes of reduced chemical species (e.g.,
manganese and iron) by replenishing dissolved oxygen (O2) in the hypolimnion. Manga-
nese (Mn) in particular is becoming a serious problem for water treatment on a global scale.
While it has been established that HOx can increase sediment O2 uptake rates and
subsequently enhance the sediment oxic zone via elevated near-sediment O2 and mixing,
the inﬂuence of HOx on sediment-water ﬂuxes of chemical species with more complicated
redox kinetics like Mn has not been comprehensively evaluated.
This study was based on Mn and O2 data collected primarily in-situ to characterize both
the sediment and water column in a drinking-water-supply reservoir equipped with an
HOx. While diffusive Mn ﬂux out of the sediment was enhanced by HOx operation due to
an increased concentration driving force across the sediment-water interface, oxygenation
maintained elevated near-sediment and porewater O2 levels that facilitated biogeochem-
ical cycling and subsequent retention of released Mn within the benthic region. Results
show that soluble Mn levels in the lower hypolimnion increased substantially when the
HOx was turned off for as little as w48 h and the upper sediment became anoxic. Turning
off the HOx for longer periods (i.e., several weeks) signiﬁcantly impaired water quality due
to sediment Mn release. Continual oxygenation maintained an oxic benthic region sufﬁ-
cient to prevent Mn release to the overlying source water.

Introduction
The condition of water supplies in many regions of the world
is deteriorating and water may soon prove to be the most
critical natural resource governing human and ecosystem
health (Gleick, 2003; NRC, 2004). Alternative approaches for
improving water quality are being explored to address the
serious issue of global drinking-water supplies. Hypolimnetic
oxygenation systems (HOx) are being used by drinking-water
and hydropower utilities, as well as other lake and reservoir
managers, to improve water quality by replenishing dissolved
oxygen (O2) and decreasing levels of reduced chemical species
in the bulk hypolimnion (Beutel, 2003; Moore, 2003) while
preserving stratiﬁcation (Wu¨ est et al., 1992; Singleton and
Little, 2006; Gantzer et al., 2009a,b). Hypolimnetic water is
desirable as a drinking-water source because it is cooler and

contains less organic matter compared to the epilimnion.
However, seasonal hypoxia often causes the hypolimnion to
have increased levels of reduced chemical species as they are
released from anoxic sediment (Gafsi et al., 2009).
Manganese (Mn) speciﬁcally is becoming a serious problem
for water treatment on a global scale (Kohl and Medlar, 2006).
Although Mn is regulated in drinking water for aesthetic
reasons (odor, taste, color), neurological health risks associ-
ated with excess Mn in drinking water are being identiﬁed
worldwide (Hafeman et al., 2007; Walker et al., 2007; Bouchard
et al., 2011). Treatment of source water (i.e., water designated
as a drinking-water source prior to treatment-plant intake)
with elevated Mn concentrations can be difﬁcult due to the
complexity of Mn redox kinetics (Balzer, 1982; Nealson et al.,
1988). The removal of metals from source water during
water treatment is feasible; however, the process is not
always effective and requires the use of chemical oxidants
that can react with naturally occurring organic matter to form
carcinogenic compounds, thus posing a health risk (Budd
et al., 2007; Brandhuber and Clark, 2008).
It has been established that HOx can decrease soluble Mn
levels in the hypolimnion (Zaw and Chiswell, 1999; Gantzer
et al., 2009b) by increasing hypolimnetic O2 which facilitates
Mn oxidation and/or adsorption to other particles and
subsequent
precipitation
to
the
sediment. However,
O2
dynamics and biogeochemical transformation processes are
highly variable across the sediment-water interface (SWI) due
to large spatial gradients in chemical, physical, and microbial
properties (Santschi et al., 1990). Thus, as increased levels of
oxide precipitates reach the sediment, potentially signiﬁcant
changes in the sediment O2 uptake rate (JO2) and other
chemical ﬂuxes at the SWI may occur (Jørgensen and
Revsbech, 1985; Zhang et al., 1999). As a result, the inﬂuence
of HOx on sediment-water ﬂuxes of dissolved species (e.g., O2,
Mn) may not be as well understood as the inﬂuence on the
water column. Recent work has indicated that JO2 is more
strongly controlled by HOx-induced mixing rather than
hypolimnetic O2 levels, highlighting the need for continual
mixing to maintain an oxic sediment zone (Bryant et al.,
2011a). Additionally, it has been shown that technical lake
management procedures such as HOx can fail to effectively
decrease
reduced-species
ﬂux
from
the
sediment
and
enhance water quality in some systems (Zaw and Chiswell,
1999; Matzinger et al., 2010).
While previous work has established that HOx increase JO2
via elevated near-sediment O2 and turbulence levels (Moore
et al., 1996; Beutel, 2003; Bryant et al., 2011a), the inﬂuence
of HOx on sediment-water ﬂuxes of reduced chemical species
has not been comprehensively evaluated. Much of the work
that has been done on using oxygenation to improve water
quality has focused on the water column (Zaw and Chiswell,
1999; Matthews and Efﬂer, 2006; Gantzer et al., 2009b).
However, the complex nature of biogeochemical cycling at the
SWI must be taken into account when assessing the overall
inﬂuence of HOx. The few studies that have been done on
HOx-induced variation in sediment-water ﬂuxes have been
largely theoretical or laboratory based (Moore et al., 1996;
Beutel, 2003). The work presented here is based on sediment
and water-column Mn and O2 data collected primarily in-situ
in a drinking-water-supply reservoir equipped with an HOx to
speciﬁcally investigate how HOx operations affect sediment-
water Mn cycling and source-water quality under actual
reservoir conditions. Mn and O2 proﬁle data obtained via in-
situ porewater analyzers, multi-species voltammetric elec-
trodes, and O2 microsensors are (1) compared and (2) evalu-
ated to determine the inﬂuence of HOx operations and
resultant sediment O2 conditions on the vertical distribution
of Mn across the SWI. This study also characterizes (3) HOx-
induced variation in diffusive ﬂux of soluble Mn (JMn) out of
the sediment and (4) biogeochemical cycling and subsequent
retention of Mn in the benthic region. The multiple methods
used to collect data were employed at different locations and
time periods (deﬁned in Sec. 2.1) to assess Mn cycling on
temporal as well as local and reservoir-wide spatial scales.
This work enables greater understanding of biogeochemical
cycling across the SWI and the inﬂuence of HOx on sediment
Mn retention and also illustrates how to successfully manage
HOx operation for controlling sediment release of reduced
chemical species to the hypolimnion.

Materials and methods
2.1.
Study site and in-situ instrumentation
This study was based on work performed at Carvins Cove
Reservoir (CCR), a eutrophic drinking-water-supply reservoir
(maximum depth of 23 m, width of w600 m, and length of
w8000 m) managed by the Western Virginia Water Authority
in Virginia, USA (Fig. 1). A linear bubble-plume HOx (Mobley
et al., 1997; Singleton et al., 2007) was installed in the deep-
est section of CCR near the treatment-plant outtake (Fig. 1) in
2005 and since that time ongoing ﬁeld campaigns have been
performed to monitor performance (Gantzer et al., 2009a,b;
Bryant et al., 2011a,b).
A network of in-situ and laboratory measurements was
performed from 2005 to 2008 to evaluate sediment-water ﬂux.
Each year, focused ﬁeld sampling typically lasted from the
start of stratiﬁcation in March through the end of fall turnover
in November. Samples were obtained primarily from near-
ﬁeld sites CCR-1 and CCR-2 in the immediate vicinity of the
HOx, mid-reservoir site CCR-6, and in the back region at site
CCR-7 to characterize the reservoir-wide inﬂuence of the HOx
(Fig. 1). The HOx was installed in CCR to address source-water-
quality issues with both Mn and iron (Fe); hypolimnetic Mn
and Fe concentrations typically increased to w20 mmol L1
during summer stratiﬁcation prior to oxygenation (Gantzer
et al., 2009b). Although soluble Fe was quickly eliminated
with oxygenation, as Fe oxidizes easily in the presence of O2,
complex Mn redox kinetics contributed to more persistent
CCR water-quality problems with Mn (Santschi et al., 1990;
Nealson and Saffarini, 1994; Gantzer et al., 2009b). While Mn,
Fe,
and
O2
were
tracked
concurrently
throughout
the
campaign, Mn data are the primary focus of the current study
to determine the inﬂuence of oxygenation on Mn sediment-
water cycling. The vertical distribution of O2 at the SWI was
measured at mm-scale increments using an in-situ micro-
proﬁler. O2 concentration proﬁle data were also obtained from
undisturbed sediment cores extracted from the study sites
and
transported
to
the
laboratory

microsensors
and
solid-state
voltammetric
electrodes
(Brendel and Luther, 1995). Reduced Mn (Mn2þ) proﬁles were
also measured using the voltammetric electrodes. Diffusive
porewater samplers (“peepers”; Hesslein, 1976) were used to
obtain in-situ soluble Mn concentration proﬁles across the
SWI at cm-scale increments. Peeper data were used to
temporally track how JMn responded to variations in HOx
oxygen-gas ﬂow rates while voltammetric-electrode data
from sediment cores were used to assess spatial variation in
sediment-porewater composition on a reservoir-wide scale
and to verify peeper data. Bulk sediment samples were
analyzed for total Mn and Fe. Water samples from different
elevations in the water column and water overlying the
sediment of core samples were used to track changes in total
and soluble Mn and Fe. Water-column proﬁles were obtained
using a SeaBird Electronics SBE19Plus with SBE43 DO sensor
(CTD; Conductivity-Temperature-O2 as a function of Depth) to
track water-column O2 levels and density stratiﬁcation as
a
function
of
temperature.
Further
details
on
primary
measurements are provided below.
2.1.1.
O2 microproﬁles at the SWI
Data characterizing the vertical distribution of O2 at the SWI
were used to track sediment oxic conditions (quantiﬁed by
depth of the sediment oxic zone (zmax) and O2 concentration at
the SWI). During 2005 and 2006, O2 microproﬁles at the SWI
were measured via microsensor proﬁling of sediment cores.
Sediment cores were obtained using a ball corer (Uwitec) with
a core-tube diameter of 90 mm and height of 120 cm.
Following extraction, sediment cores were kept in the dark
and on ice as they were transported to the laboratory and were
typically proﬁled within w1 h of extraction. Sediment cores
were cut to an appropriate height (w20 cm) for proﬁling using
a Uwitec corecutter. Care was taken to ensure sediment cores
remained undisturbed during the extraction and cutting
process. Sediment cores were proﬁled using Clark-type O2
microsensors (OX-100; Unisense A/S) which have an internal
reference and a guard cathode. OX-100 microsensors have an
extremely small tip size and depth resolution (100 mm), rapid
response time (90% response in <10 s), and negligible stirring
sensitivity. The microsensors were manually controlled by
a micromanipulator (M3301R; World Precision Instruments,
Inc.) and were supported by a high-sensitivity picoammeter
(PA2000; Unisense A/S). Mild mixing of the core water column
was maintained during proﬁling. Cores were proﬁled at 1-mm
depth resolution and three measurements were obtained at
each depth. Additional single-point measurements of the SWI
were also obtained in triplicate. A linear calibration of the
microsensor was obtained for each core using O2 concentra-
tions in the overlying water, as determined via Winkler titra-
tion, and in the anoxic sediment of the core.
During 2007 and 2008, an autonomous microproﬁler (MP4;
Unisense
A/S)
equipped
with
microsensors
(O2
(OX-100),
temperature (TP-100), and pH (PH-100); Unisense A/S) was used
to obtain SWI microproﬁles in-situ. The MP4 OX-100 has the
same speciﬁcations as described for the laboratory microsensor.
The thermo-coupled TP-100 has a spatial resolution of w200 mm,
resolution of 0.1 mV per C, and 90% response time of <3 s. The
pH-100isaminiaturizedconventionalpHelectrodewithaspatial
resolution of w200 mm, detection limit of 0.1 pH unit, and 90%
response time of <20 s. The pH microsensor was used solely to
obtain single-point measurements and the longer response time
was not an issue for proﬁling. In-situ proﬁles were collected in
duplicate at each sample site and ten measurements were taken
at each depth (excluding multi-day campaigns in 2008 where
proﬁles were measured continuously and three measurements
were obtained per depth due to data storage limitations; Bryant
et al., 2011a). The proﬁle sequence was as follows: 10-mm reso-
lution from 10 cm to 1 cm above the SWI, 1-mm resolution from
1 cm to 0.5 cm above the SWI, 0.1-mm resolution from 0.5 cm
above the SWI to 0.5 cm below the SWI. Following a pause at each
depth for equilibration, data were collected at a rate of 1 Hz. A full
proﬁle was obtained every w50e70 min. A video camera was
used periodically to ensure that the MP4 remained stable during
extended in-situ campaigns.
During sediment-core proﬁling, the SWI location was
easily identiﬁed visually. For microproﬁles obtained in-situ,
the SWI location was determined via both visual interpreta-
tions of O2 proﬁle data (based on identifying linear regions
characteristic of the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) immedi-
ately above the sediment and kinks in the proﬁle due to
porosity differences between the sediment and the water
column) and using standard deviations of O2 temporal ﬂuc-
tuations obtained at each sampling-depth increment (Bryant
et al., 2010a). The depth where O2 dropped to <3 mmol L1
was designated as zmax.
2.1.2.
Voltammetric O2 and Mn2þ proﬁles at the SWI
During two sampling events in July 2007 and July 2008, sedi-
ment cores were collected along a longitudinal transect (Sites
Fig. 1 e Map of Carvins Cove Reservoir (CCR) showing
locations of sampling sites (near-ﬁeld locations CCR-1 (0 m;
relative to start of hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOx)
lines) and CCR-2 (189 m); mid-reservoir locations CCR-3
thru CCR-6 (683, 1011, 1373, and 1814 m, respectively);
back-reservoir location CCR-7 (3000 m)) and the linear
bubble-plume HOx. From Bryant et al. (2011a).

CCR-1 to CCR-6, Fig. 1) to characterize spatial variation in the
vertical distribution of O2 and Mn2þ across the SWI. Dissolved
Mn2þ and O2 concentration-depth proﬁles were simulta-
neously measured using a solid-state mercury-gold-amalgam
voltammetric electrode positioned above the SWI of the cores.
The voltammetric electrodes, fabricated according to previous
work (Brendel and Luther, 1995; Luther et al., 1999), consisted
of 100-mm-diameter gold (Au) wire encased in an epoxy-ﬁlled
borosilicate glass tube. The glass tube was heated at the end
and stretched to a diameter of w1 mm at the tip. After
smoothing the tip of the electrode with diamond-paste polish,
the gold wire surface was plated with a mercury (Hg)
amalgam. The Hg-Au voltammetric electrode was used as the
working electrode in conjunction with a silver/silver-chloride
reference electrode and a platinum-wire counter electrode for
a three-electrode voltammetric system controlled by a DLK-60
potentiostat (Analytical Information Systems, Inc.). Sediment
cores for voltammetric-electrode proﬁling were obtained and
proﬁled as described in Sec. 2.1.1. Additional details on elec-
trode voltammetry and calibration are included in Sec. S.1
(Supplementary Information).
2.1.3.
In-situ soluble Mn proﬁles at the SWI
Peepers, constructed following Hesslein (1976), Urban et al.
(1997), and Lewandowski et al. (2002), were used to obtain in-
situ data tracking temporal and spatial variation in the vertical
distribution of soluble Mn across the SWI and corresponding JMn.
Each peeper had a single column of 40 sampling chambers with
a vertical proﬁle resolution of 1 cm. The chambers (each 20-mL in
volume) were covered with Millipore 0.45-mm HV Durapore
membrane. Peepers were deployed with aluminum frames that
positioned the peeper vertically into the sediment so that half of
the peeper chambers were exposed to the water overlying the
sediment and half of the chambers were exposed to sediment
porewater (Fig. S1; Supplementary Information). Additional
details on peeper construction and deployment are included in
Sec. S.2. Peepers were deployed in duplicate for 2e4 weeks at
a time to allow the peepers to come to equilibrium with in-situ
water at locations CCR-1 (2006e2007), CCR-2 (2007e2008), CCR-
6 (2007e2008), and CCR-7 (2008). Immediately upon retrieval,
water samples were obtained via sterilized pipettes from each
peeper chamber, transferred to acidiﬁed plastic tubes, and then
analyzed for metals via inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) spec-
troscopy (Clesceri et al., 1998).
2.1.4.
Water sample measurements
Because peeper data could only be obtained on a bi-weekly
basis, “near-sediment” water samples were used to increase
the frequency of metals data collection. Near-sediment water
samples were obtained using a syringe with attached tubing to
withdraw water from w5 cm above the SWI in sediment cores.
Additionally, water samples were collected from the hypo-
limnionat 3-m-incrementsfrom thesurfaceusinga Kemmerer
bottle to characterize the water column. Water samples for
total metal analysis were transferred directly to pre-acidiﬁed
plastic bottles. Samples for soluble metal analysis were
ﬁltered through 0.45-mm Millipore ﬁlter paper before being
transferred and acidiﬁed. Samples were then analyzed via ICP
(Clesceri et al., 1998). For this study, the zone from w1 m above
the sediment down to the upper sediment layer is designated
as the “benthic region.” Near-sediment water samples and
bulk-hypolimnion samples obtained at w1 m above the sedi-
ment were both used to characterize this region.
2.1.5.
Bulk sediment measurements
The upper w2 cm of sediment from undisturbed sediment
cores was transferred directly into sterile glass containers.
Samples were analyzed following standard methods for total
solids (SM2540B; Greenberg et al., 1992), total Fe and Mn
(SW6010B and SW3050B; EPA, 1996), and total organic carbon
(Lloyd Kahn; EPA, 1988).
2.2.
Flux analyses
While chemical and biological processes may inﬂuence JMn,
solute ﬂux models of the SWI are typically based on diffusive
transport (Jørgensen and Boudreau, 2001; Lavery et al., 2001).
Diffusive ﬂuxes were estimated using peeper (JMn), voltammetric
electrode (JO2, JMn2þ), and O2 microsensor (JO2) proﬁle data and
were analyzed using Fick’s law(Rasmussen and Jørgensen, 1992):

(1)
where Ji is diffusive ﬂux for species i (soluble Mn, Mn2þ, or O2)
out of the sediment, 4 is sediment porosity (m3 voids m3 total
volume), Dsi and Di are the species-dependent diffusion coef-
ﬁcients in sediment and water, respectively (m2 s1), and dDBL
is DBL thickness (m; Jørgensen and Revsbech, 1985). C indi-
cates species concentration, vC/vz is the linear concentration
gradient immediately below the SWI (mmol m4), Cbulk is the
concentration in the bulk water (mmol L1), and CSWI is the
concentration at the SWI (mmol L1). Depth z and ﬂux Ji are
deﬁned negative into the sediment with the SWI at z ¼ 0.
Diffusive transport in the sediment is given by the second
term in Eq. (1) and in the water by the third term. Water-side
proﬁle data are frequently more difﬁcult to evaluate due to
rapid turbulence-induced variation in dDBL (Bryant et al.,
2010a). Furthermore, dDBL, which is typically mm scale, could
not be accurately measured using cm-scale peeper data. Thus,
Ji was estimated by applying the second term to sediment-side
data. For voltammetric electrode and microsensor data, vC/vz
was calculated from the slope of a linear regression of
concentration data spanning from the interface (z ¼ 0) to
depths of z ¼ 1 to 3 mm. For peeper data (of lower vertical
resolution), vC/vz was based on the linear regression slope of
concentration data spanning from z ¼ 0 to depths of z ¼ 20 to
40 mm. Quasi-steady-state conditions were assumed for
peeper data based on the extended deployment period. The
temporal change in O2 concentration (vC/vt) was evaluated for
in-situ O2 proﬁle series as described by Bryant et al. (2010a)
and was found to be on average <5% of JO2, indicating that
O2 proﬁles were also at quasi-steady state.
Sediment cores from the primary sampling locations (Fig. 1)
were evaluated for 4 as described by Bryant et al. (2010a) and 4
values of 0.95e0.97 were obtained. To correct for sediment
tortuosity as a function of 4 (Glud, 2008; Bryant et al., 2010b), Dsi
was deﬁned as Dsi ¼ 4Di. Values for Di were based on
DMn2þ ¼ 6.88  1010 m2 s1 at 25 C and DO2 ¼ 1.97  109 m2 s1
at 20
C and were corrected for temperature using the

StokeseEinstein relationship (Li and Gregory, 1974; Arega and
Lee, 2005). For peeper-based JMn calculations, it was assumed
that soluble Mn data were completely in the dissolved, reduced
form of Mn2þ. This assumption may have resulted in slightly
overestimated JMn values due to transport effects of insoluble,
colloidal particles small enough to pass through 0.45-mm
ﬁlters; however, its validity is supported by Mn2þ proﬁle data
obtained via voltammetric electrode which conﬁrm that
a majority of near-surface soluble Mn was in the reduced Mn2þ
form (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2).

Results and discussion
3.1.
Comparison of proﬁle methods
Peepers and multi-species voltammetric electrodes were used
to obtain Mn proﬁle data while microsensors and voltam-
metric electrodes were used to obtain O2 proﬁle data across
the SWI. Both sets of methods have advantages and limita-
tions. Peepers were deployed in-situ but measured only
soluble metals at cm-scale vertical resolution; mm-scale
measurements of O2 and dissolved Mn2þ were obtained via
sediment-core proﬁling using the voltammetric electrodes
and microsensors though these data may have been inﬂu-
enced by redox changes occurring during transport and
measurement of the cores under ex-situ conditions. Never-
theless, analogous trends were obtained from both sets of
methods for changes in concentration with depth of Mn and
O2 (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, respectively). While peeper and
voltammetric-electrode
data
were
obtained
at
different
vertical resolutions (10-mm vs. 1-mm increments, respec-
tively) and by different sampling methods (in-situ vs. ex-situ,
respectively), changes in concentration with depth were
relatively consistent between these methods (Fig. 2). For some
proﬁle sets (e.g., Fig. 2a), deviation between soluble Mn
(peeper) proﬁles and dissolved Mn2þ (electrode) proﬁles was
observed as Mn2þ decreased at deeper depths which may be
attributed to the upward diffusion of Mn2þ, the presence of
dissolved Mn3þ, increased levels of colloidal Mn3þ and/or
Mn4þ, and/or Mn adsorption to Fe-oxides and other particu-
late matter. Similar microsensor and voltammetric-electrode
measurements of depth-speciﬁc O2 concentrations were ob-
tained (Fig. S2). Depth-speciﬁc Mn concentrations obtained via
voltammetric electrode and peepers were comparable though
they were not entirely consistent (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, while
soluble (<0.45 mm) Mn measurements from peepers could
include colloidal Mn, as mentioned in Sec. 2.2, Mn2þ concen-
tration quantiﬁed by voltammetric-electrode proﬁles of sedi-
ment cores as compared to peeper data indicated that most
Mn measured by peepers was Mn2þ.
While voltammetric electrode and peeper measurements
yielded similar concentration-depth Mn proﬁles, diffusional
ﬂuxes calculated from these data were not comparable
(Fig. S3). Absolute values of electrode-based ﬂux measure-
ments, jJMn2þj, were an order of magnitude higher than
peeper-based jJMnj due to the difference in the thickness of
the gradient layer used to quantify vC/vz (mm- vs. cm-scale).
As
shown
by
voltammetric-electrode
data
(Fig.
2),
the
steepest concentration gradient occurs within the top few
mm of sediment. Peeper-based jJMnj values were quantiﬁed
over the top few cm of sediment (Fig. 2) resulting in
‘smoothed’ proﬁles and smaller vC/vz values that would
underestimate the actual diffusional ﬂux. These results
highlight the importance of obtaining proﬁles at the ﬁnest
vertical resolution possible to fully characterize ﬂuxes at the
SWI. For this study, the voltammetric electrodes were
beneﬁcial for characterizing the vertical distribution of Mn2þ
at a ﬁne depth resolution and on a reservoir-wide scale;
however, peepers were advantageous in that they allowed
in-situ proﬁles to be obtained almost continuously for three
years. Peeper-based JMn values over time were used as
a relative comparison to characterize the effect of temporal
changes in soluble Mn as a function of HOx operation while
acknowledging that these JMn estimates may not fully char-
acterize true diffusional Mn2þ ﬂux due to colloidal Mn effects
and the increased vertical resolution of peeper measure-
ments relative to changes in the vertical distribution of Mn
near the SWI.

3.2.
Inﬂuence of HOx on vertical Mn distribution at SWI
Contour plots were created based on a Kriging interpolation
scheme using peeper data from the near-ﬁeld region and were
evaluated with respect to HOx ﬂow during 2006e2008 (Fig. 3).
Soluble Mn levels at the SWI varied signiﬁcantly in response to
changes in HOx operation. When the HOx was turned off for
one month in 2006, soluble Mn levels both in the water over-
lying the sediment and in sediment porewater increased
substantially at CCR-1 (Fig. 3a). Similar results were obtained
at CCR-2 during 2007 in response to decreased HOx ﬂow
(Fig.
3b).
Conversely,
near-sediment
Mn
concentrations
remained low while sediment porewater concentrations
increased at CCR-2 during continuous HOx operation in 2008
(Fig. 3c). Analogous results were also obtained mid-reservoir
at CCR-6 (Fig. S4). Soluble Mn levels in the sediment steadily
increased
over
each
season
of
HOx
operation.
As
Mn
precipitated out of the oxygenated water column and became
incorporated into the upper sediment, Mn-oxide particles
were likely transformed back to soluble Mn as they reached
the more reducing sediment environment (Jørgensen and
Boudreau, 2001). While soluble Mn porewater concentrations
were slightly higher in CCR relative to other freshwater
studies, they are on the same order of magnitude (Urban et al.,
1997; Schaller and Wehrli, 1997) and regional geology is known
to have high levels of Mn (Stose et al., 1919; Mussman and
Reid, 1986).
The abiotic oxidation rate of Mn is dependent on pH and is
relatively slow, with an oxidation-rate constant for Mn of
0.0006 mmol1 m3 h1 as compared to 0.004 mmol1 m3 h1 for
Fe (Wang and Van Cappellen, 1996; Morgan, 2005; Brand et al.,
2009), particularly at typical pH values (pH 7e9) of natural
waters (Belzile et al., 1996; Crittenden et al., 2005). Microsensor
pH data conﬁrmed that pH remained between w8 and 9 in the
sediment in CCR and a correlation between porewater Mn
concentration and pH was not found. Mn oxidation and/or
precipitation may have therefore been controlled by biological
oxidation processes and/or adsorption onto particulate matter
(Nealson et al., 1988; Santschi et al., 1990). As the upper sedi-
ment became more oxic, biologically mediated reduction of
Mn may also have been hindered. The inﬂuence of sediment
microbes
on
CCR
Mn
dynamics
is
being
explored
in
a companion study (Bryant et al., 2011b).
Core-water data obtained at 5 cm above the SWI provide
additional veriﬁcation of HOx-induced variation in near-
sediment Mn and Fe (Fig. 4). Typically, a consistent propor-
tion of soluble Mn relative to total Mn was maintained with Mn
Fig. 3 e Contour plots based on peeper data obtained near
the HOx at near-ﬁeld sites CCR-1 in 2006 (a) and CCR-2 in
2007 (b) and 2008 (c). Corresponding variations in HOx ﬂow
are delineated by the solid black line. The dashed black
line indicates the SWI location.

almost completely in soluble form while a greater percentage
of Fe remained in the insoluble, particulate form. This obser-
vation is consistent with previous work highlighting the ease
with which Mn reduces in low O2 conditions compared to Fe
(Balzer, 1982; Davison, 1985). Mn and Fe concentrations
remained relatively low at all sampling locations during
periods when the HOx was in operation. However, consider-
able increases in total and soluble metal concentrations at 5 cm
above the sediment were observed when HOx ﬂow was
reduced or halted (Fig. 4a, b). While HOx-induced variation in
Mn and Fe concentrations was observed throughout the
reservoir, as indicated by data obtained directly alongside the
HOx at CCR-2 (Fig. 4a) and mid-reservoir at CCR-6 (Fig. 4b), not
all sampling locations were equally affected. As shown by
Fig.
4c,
near-sediment
metal
concentrations
at
CCR-5
remained fairly constant. While CCR-6 is located farther
away from the HOx than CCR-5, CCR-6 was more directly
inﬂuenced by HOx plume detrainment (McGinnis et al., 2004;
Singleton et al., 2007) due to its higher elevation and typically
had an enhanced sediment oxic zone during HOx operation
(Fig. 1; Bryant et al., 2011a). These results illustrate the inﬂu-
ence of plume dynamics which are affected by reservoir
bathmetry, diffuser location, applied gas-ﬂow rate, and water-
column thermal structure (Gantzer et al., 2009a).
Analogous results based on in-situ O2 data also emphasize
the inﬂuence of HOx operations on SWI conditions (Fig. 5). In-
situ MP4 proﬁles and near-sediment water-sample measure-
ments at CCR-6 reveal a strong correlation between O2 at the
SWI, zmax, near-sediment Mn and Fe, and HOx ﬂow. When the
HOx was turned off for w48 h in August 2008, SWI O2 levels
dropped to zero as the sediment became anoxic for over
a week until the vertical O2 distribution was ﬁnally re-
established (Bryant et al., 2011a). The delayed sediment
response to turning off the HOx is likely due to the time
required for O2 and mixing conditions to return to steady-
state up-reservoir at CCR-6. A substantial increase in total
and soluble Mn and Fe in the overlying water was observed
during this anoxic period (Fig. 5) which clearly reveals how
HOx operations can control sediment O2 availability and
metal cycling near the SWI.
Results show that HOx operations strongly inﬂuenced
sediment O2 conditions and Mn retention throughout CCR
(Figs. 3e5) although the response was not the same at all
locations (Fig. 4). To determine if localized sediment compo-
sition and corresponding porewater concentrations were
a factor in the observed response to HOx operations, pore-
water proﬁles obtained along the longitudinal transect of the
reservoir from all seven CCR sampling sites during normal
HOx operating conditions were assessed (Fig. 1). Based on July
2007 voltammetric-electrode proﬁle data, zmax was 1e3 mm
and porewater concentrations were w100 mmol L1 O2 and
w100e300 mmol L1 Mn2þ in the upper mm of sediment at
most sites (CCR-1 thru CCR-5; Fig. S2). At CCR-6, sediment
conditions were more oxic with an increased zmax and no Mn2þ
was measured in the upper sediment which again may be
attributed to the inﬂuence of HOx plume detrainment in this
region (Bryant et al., 2011a). In July 2008, however, O2 and Mn2þ
proﬁles were more uniform and average porewater Mn2þ
concentrations in the upper sediment decreased considerably.
Nevertheless, while sediment oxic conditions were relatively
similar in 2007 and 2008, no discernable correlation was found
between HOx proximity and the vertical distribution of Mn2þ
and corresponding JMn2þ at each sampling site (Figs. S2, S3).
Porewater Mn2þ concentrations and JMn2þ values were consis-
tently higher in 2007 (e.g., JMn2þ was 1.7e15.6 mmol mm2
day1 in 2007 and 1.4e5.4 mmol mm2 day1 in 2008). Oper-
ating the HOx at a higher ﬂow rate in July 2007 than in July 2008
(Fig. 3) may have resulted in increased porewater Mn2þ due to
enhanced precipitation and incorporation of Mn oxides (dis-
cussed in Sec. 3.4).
At CCR-7, the site farthest upstream, core-water and
peeper data show that near-sediment and porewater Mn
concentrations were signiﬁcantly lower than those measured
throughout the rest of CCR (e.g., 130 mmol L1 versus
360 mmol L1 average soluble Mn in the upper 5 cm; Fig. S4).
This may be attributed to decreased levels of total Mn in the
bulk sediment (data not shown) and negligible sediment
focusing in this region relative to deeper CCR regions.
3.3.
HOx-induced variation in JMn
Diffusive ﬂux at the SWI is driven by the concentration
gradient (vC/vz) within the DBL, a mm-scale laminar layer
immediately above the sediment (Jørgensen and Revsbech,
1985), which is in turn regulated by turbulence in the over-
lying water and subsequent dDBL. Natural variation in turbu-
lence has been shown to have a signiﬁcant effect on dDBL and
sediment-water ﬂuxes (Lorke et al., 2003; Brand et al., 2009;
Bryant et al., 2010a). HOx-induced increases in turbulence
and changes in near-sediment and porewater concentrations
of O2 and Mn could decrease dDBL and increase vC/vz,

respectively, thereby signiﬁcantly affecting JO2 and JMn (per Eq.
(1) and Bryant et al., 2011a).
Concentrations of O2 and soluble Mn at the SWI typically
increased in the near ﬁeld as a result of HOx operation (Fig. 6),
supporting mid-reservoir O2 data presented in Fig. 5. Soluble
Mn concentrations at 1 m above the sediment generally par-
alleled Mn concentrations at the SWI, with increases in Mn
observed
as
each
oxygenation
season
progressed
in
2006e2008. Soluble Mn levels in the bulk hypolimnion at 4 m
above the sediment, however, remained negligible excluding
the period when the HOx was turned off for one month in 2006
(Figs. 3a and 6). Average concentrations of soluble Mn in the
bulk hypolimnion increased by a factor of 10 (from w1 mmol
L1 to w10 mmol L1) during this period (Gantzer et al., 2009b).
These results indicate that HOx operation did facilitate the
precipitation of oxidized Mn and/or sorption of Mn to particles
that settled to the benthic region, thereby decreasing Mn levels
in the overlying bulk water. However, these Mn-containing
particles likely became reduced upon reaching the less-oxic
benthic region, resulting in increased soluble Mn concentra-
tions in sediment porewater and in regions immediately above
the sediment (e.g., at 1 m). Regardless, Mn concentrations at
the SWI and at 1 m above were typically lower during
oxygenation, particularly during periods of steady HOx ﬂow,
than when HOx ﬂow was reduced or halted and O2 concen-
trations at the SWI dropped (also supported by near-sediment
water data; Figs. 3e6). Hypolimnetic Mn concentrations
dropped dramatically each year following fall turnover as O2
levels were replenished, after which HOx ﬂow was decreased
and sediment data were no longer collected until the following
spring (Zhang et al., 1999; Gantzer et al., 2009b).
Enhanced JMn is observed during periods of increased HOx
ﬂow rate. While focus should be placed on the temporal vari-
ation in JMn with respect to HOx ﬂow rather than quantiﬁed ﬂux
values, since JMn estimates may differ from actual JMn2þ (dis-
cussed in Secs. 2.2, 3.1), estimates of CCR JMn are comparable to
values obtained from other freshwater lake systems (Johnson
et al., 1991; Belzile et al., 1996). JMn is shown to increase when
the HOx was in operation and decrease when HOx ﬂow was
signiﬁcantly reduced or halted for an extended period (e.g.,
June 2006 and September 2007). Following constant oxygena-
tion, JMn peaked at 0.67 mmol m2 d1 in August 2008. When
the HOx was turned off for one month in July 2006, JMn reached
a minimum value of 0.34 mmol m2 d1 as the sediment
became anoxic and near-sediment Mn levels increased due to
sediment Mn release. Direct correlation between soluble Mn
levels in the benthic region, JMn, and HOx ﬂow rate was
observed both near the HOx (Fig. 6) and mid-reservoir (Fig. S5).
It has been shown that JO2 into the sediment was increased
by HOx operations due to elevated near-sediment O2 levels
and a subsequently increased O2 vC/vz through the DBL
(Beutel, 2003; Bryant et al., 2011a). Likewise, water-column
levels of Mn can be signiﬁcantly decreased by oxygenation
(Gantzer et al., 2009b); as a result, sediment concentrations
should increase as the metals are oxidized and precipitate to
the sediment. As evidenced by peeper and water-sample data
(Figs.
3e6),
continuous
HOx
operations
did
maintain
decreased Mn levels in the overlying water while Mn pore-
water concentrations increased. A comparison of water-
column data obtained during June 2006 when the HOx was
turned off for one month and during June 2008 following
continuous oxygenation supports that HOx-induced oxidation
and precipitation of Mn did occur, as mid-hypolimnetic
concentrations
of
soluble
Mn
decreased
from
0.6
to
0.2 mmol L1 while particulate Mn decreased from 3.5 to
1.1 mmol L1 and particulate Fe, which can enhance Mn
adsorption and subsequent precipitation, decreased from 2.3
to 0.7 mmol L1 in response to oxygenation (data not shown).
Hence, Mn vC/vz at the SWI and corresponding JMn were
enhanced (Fig. 6), albeit in the opposing direction of JO2. HOx-
induced decreases in dDBL (Bryant et al., 2011a) would have
also facilitated increased JMn out of the sediment during
oxygenation. Conversely, when the HOx was turned off,
observed decreases in JMn may be attributed to decreased Mn
vC/vz at the SWI as dDBL increased in the absence of HOx-
induced mixing and the sediment became anoxic, resulting
in substantial increases in soluble metal concentrations in the
overlying water (Figs. 3e6). An initial increase in JMn very likely
occurred immediately after HOx operations were halted and
Mn was released as the sediment became anoxic (Figs. 3a and
5). However, the temporal scale of peeper measurements,
which were obtained over a two-week deployment period, did
not facilitate capturing such rapid changes in ﬂux. The release
of Mn2þ as the sediment became anoxic would have contrib-
uted to observed decreases in O2 at the SWI (e.g., June 2006 in
Fig. 6) as Mn2þ and other reduced species were subsequently
re-oxidized (Glud et al., 2007) and near-sediment O2 was not
re-supplied by the HOx.
3.4.
Biogeochemical cycling effects
While JMn results showing enhanced JMn during oxygenation
(Fig. 5) may appear to be in conﬂict with the overall goal of
using HOx to reduce Mn levels in the water column, it should
be emphasized that JMn is a diffusive ﬂux and therefore does
not take into account other processes (e.g., adsorption/
Fig. 6 e Correlation between O2 and soluble Mn
concentrations at the SWI, soluble Mn at 1 m (benthic
region) and 4 m (lower hypolimnion) above the sediment,
and diffusive ﬂux of soluble Mn (JMn) in the near ﬁeld as

inﬂuencing Mn transport at the SWI. Results shown in Fig. 6
support that while HOx operations increased JMn out of the
sediment, reduced Mn is re-oxidized in the oxic benthic region
and prevented from reaching the bulk hypolimnion, thereby
sustaining an HOx-supported Mn redox cycle. Simple mass
balance calculations were performed on CCR-1 data from the
2006 sampling season to evaluate the inﬂuence of benthic
biogeochemical
cycling
on
hypolimnion
water
quality.
Maximum hypolimnetic Mn concentrations were predicted
based on JMn data shown in Fig. 6, sediment trap data for total
Mn in the lower hypolimnion over the HOx (P. Gantzer,
unpubl.), and average volumes of both the bottom meter and
full depth of the hypolimnion, as follows:
Mn ¼
X
t¼198 days
JMnSsed
Vhyp
þ Rsed


mmol L1
(2)
where Ssed is surface area of hypolimnion sediment (m2), Vhyp
is volume of hypolimnion evaluated (lower 1-m or full 14-m
depth; m), and Rsed is the Mn sedimentation rate (mmol L1).
An average Rsed value of 4.4 mmol m3 d1 was estimated for
the 2006 oxygenation season. For simplicity, it was assumed
that there was no Mn initially present in the hypolimnion and
that no Mn was removed via oxidation and/or precipitation.
Thus, all Mn diffusing out of the sediment and/or precipitating
from the bulk water was considered retained in the volume
assessed (benthic (1 m) region or full hypolimnion). Initially,
measured Mn levels at 1 m above the sediment exceeded
maximum Mn levels predicted with Eq. (2) (Fig. 7). It should be
noted that this period includes the time during which the HOx
was turned off for one month. By mid-season, however, actual
Mn concentrations at 1 m were far lower than predicted Mn
concentrations. Average hypolimnetic Mn data, based on
water samples obtained mid-hypolimnion at 7 m above the
sediment,
remained
low
and
fell
far
below
predicted
maximum Mn at 7 m with the deviation indicating a net gain
of Mn to the sediment. These rough calculations character-
izing the inﬂuence of biogeochemical cycling indicate that
while JMn may be enhanced by HOx-induced increases in the
vC/vz driving force at the SWI, Mn was suppressed from the
bulk hypolimnion due to re-oxidation, precipitation, and/or
sediment adsorption. This unclosed mass balance based on
JMn and sedimentation rates (Fig. 7) highlights the inﬂuence of
processes that could not be quantiﬁed in this study and that
remain poorly understood (Cerrato et al., 2010).
Retention of Mn in the benthic region via biogeochemical
cycling (Figs. 6 and 7) is further supported by bulk-sediment
data indicating that Mn oxidation, precipitation, and subse-
quent incorporation into the sediment increased near the HOx
as a result of oxygenation (Fig. 8). Bulk-sediment Mn levels in
the near-ﬁeld region increased by an order of magnitude
during the ﬁrst three years of oxygenation. Following the start
of HOx operations in July 2005, both total Mn and Fe levels
increased substantially in the sediment at CCR-1. However,
after
the
ﬁrst
year
of
HOx
operation,
bulk-sediment
measurements remained relatively constant. CCR is largely
isolated from allochthonous input and annual nutrient
loading likely remains fairly consistent. Hence, these results
indicate that after background levels of soluble Mn and Fe
were oxidized in the ﬁrst year of HOx operation, new steady-
state conditions based on oxygenation were established.
Combined results from bulk-sediment data (Fig. 8), peeper
data (Fig. 3), and JMn estimates (Fig. 6) clearly show how

depths).

continuous oxygenation facilitated Mn removal from the
hypolimnion via Mn oxidation and precipitation in the oxic
water column and subsequent incorporation into the sedi-
ment (Jørgensen and Boudreau, 2001; Gantzer et al., 2009b).
Substantially lower levels of Fe and Mn were measured in
the bulk sediment at the mid-reservoir CCR-6 and upstream
CCR-7 sites than at near-ﬁeld sites CCR-1 and CCR-2 (data not
shown). Enhanced sediment Mn retention in the near ﬁeld
may be a result of oxidation and adsorption processes due to
increased levels of oxide particles in the region closest to the
HOx and/or sediment focusing effects in this deeper CCR
region (Fig. 1; Balzer, 1982; Santschi et al., 1990). Sediment
traps deployed throughout CCR in the lower hypolimnion
showed elevated sedimentation rates in the near ﬁeld during
summer oxygenation in 2006 and 2007 (Gantzer et al., 2009b).
Accelerated oxidation and precipitation of Mn and geochem-
ical focusing in response to oxygenation have also been
observed by Schaller and Wehrli (1997) and Zaw and Chiswell
(1999).
Based on peeper data from 2006 to 2008 (Fig. 3), average
annual Mn porewater concentrations remained fairly constant
in the upper sediment (Fig. 6). Paired with water-column data
in Fig. 6 and bulk-sediment data in Fig. 8, these results indicate
that HOx can decrease metal concentrations in the bulk
hypolimnion by facilitating increased precipitation of metal
oxides to the sediment and biogeochemical cycling within the
benthic region. Although previous work has suggested that
historical
sediment O2
demand may
be diminished by
oxygenation (Beutel, 2003), the fact that annual porewater
concentrations of soluble Mn did not decrease indicates that
the amount of available electron acceptors in the sediment and
the corresponding intrinsic sediment O2 demand (Bryant et al.,
2010a) were not reduced. Deposition of Mn- and Fe-oxides to
the sediment and subsequent reduction of these metals in the
anoxic sediment contributes to this O2 demand (Yagi, 1996;
Matzinger et al., 2010). Nevertheless, while a substantial
source of reduced metals may remain in the sediment, using
continuous oxygenation to maintain elevated near-sediment
O2 levels and an oxic sediment zone (Fig. 5; Bryant et al.,
2011a) can prevent the release of soluble species into the bulk
hypolimnion, as shown by Jørgensen and Boudreau (2001),
Beutel et al. (2008), and Gantzer et al. (2009b).

Conclusions
Results from this study have established that continuous
oxygenation promotes decreased Mn concentrations in near-
sediment water (Figs. 3e6) and elevated Mn levels in sedi-
ment porewater (Figs. 2 and 3) as Mn is incorporated into the
sediment (Fig. 8). While JMn out of the sediment (Fig. 6) was
enhanced by an increased vC/vz driving force at the SWI,
hypolimnetic water data (Figs. 6 and 7) and simple ﬂux
calculations (Fig. 7) show that near-sediment biogeochemical
cycling maintained by HOx-increased O2 levels prevented Mn
from reaching the bulk hypolimnion. The overall effect of the
HOx on source water quality is revealed in data showing that
annual average hypolimnetic Mn levels have decreased by
>97% since the start of HOx operations in 2005 (Gantzer et al.,
2009b).
This study elucidates the inﬂuence of HOx operation on
sediment-water Mn cycling and supports the viability of using
HOx to improve drinking water quality by decreasing source-
water Mn levels prior to the treatment plant. Signiﬁcant
conclusions include:
1. Comparable measurements of the vertical distribution of
soluble Mn and Mn2þ were obtained using independent
tools (peepers and voltammetric electrodes) which suggests
that a majority of soluble Mn in porewater was in the dis-
solved Mn2þ form rather than the colloidal form. The
inﬂuence of the scale at which these measurements were
obtained, cm-scale for peepers vs. mm-scale for the elec-
trodes, on estimated ﬂux is emphasized.
2. The vertical distribution of Mn at the SWI was strongly
affected by HOx operations, with soluble Mn levels in the
benthic region increasing substantially when the HOx was
turned off for as little as w48 h and the sediment became
anoxic. Leaving the HOx off for longer periods of time, e.g.,
several weeks, resulted in signiﬁcantly impaired source-
water quality due to elevated levels of Mn in the bulk
hypolimnion.
3. Perhaps seemingly contradictory to the overall goal of
decreasing hypolimnetic Mn levels, the driving force for
diffusive ﬂux JMn out of the sediment was shown to increase
as Mn concentrations increased in the sediment and
decreased in the overlying water in response to continual
oxygenation.
4. However, while JMn was enhanced by oxygenation, an oxic
SWI and near-sediment region facilitated biogeochemical
cycling that prevented Mn release to the bulk hypolimnion.
More disruptive aeration techniques (e.g., artiﬁcial destra-
tiﬁcation) may not maintain an oxic zone that facilitates
such near-sediment biogeochemical cycling due to sedi-
ment resuspension. By evaluating JMn and corresponding
Mn cycling under a range of O2 conditions using multiple
measurement techniques, the complex network of abiotic
and biotic controls on Mn redox kinetics is emphasized.
5. An oxic sediment zone and retention of soluble Mn within
the benthic region were achieved throughout the reservoir
by continuous oxygenation, thereby decreasing Mn levels
in the source water. O2 required for the oxidation of
elevated levels of reduced Mn (as well as other species such
as Fe, nitrite, and methane) in the benthic region should be
taken into account when designing HOx.
This work and that of Bryant et al. (2011a,b), which take
a sediment perspective, combined with the companion papers
of Gantzer et al. (2009a,b), which take a water-column
perspective, collectively show how oxygenation systems can
be used to optimize source-water quality by using the water-
supply reservoir as the initial stage in the treatment process.
Results may be used to improve operation of HOx by providing
a mechanistic understanding of water-quality effects in rela-
tion to system operation. In the face of problems like dwin-
dling water supplies, climate change (which may enhance
thermal stratiﬁcation and increase deep-water anoxia), and
the need to rely on unconventional water supplies, the
importance of alternative water-treatment methods like HOx
may become greater.

Controlling hypolimnetic hypoxia is a key goal of water quality management. Hypoxic
conditions can trigger the release of reduced metals and nutrients from lake sediments,
resulting in taste and odor problems as well as nuisance algal blooms. In deep lakes and
reservoirs, hypolimnetic oxygenation has emerged as a viable solution for combating
hypoxia. In shallow lakes, however, it is difﬁcult to add oxygen into the hypolimnion
efﬁciently, and a poorly designed hypolimnetic oxygenation system could potentially result
in higher turbidity, weakened thermal stratiﬁcation, and warming of the sediments. As a
result, little is known about the viability of hypolimnetic oxygenation in shallow bodies of
water. Here, we present the results from recent successful tests of side stream supersat-
uration (SSS), a type of hypolimnetic oxygenation system, in a shallow reservoir and
compare it to previous side stream deployments. We investigated the sensitivity of Falling
Creek Reservoir, a shallow (Zmax ¼ 9.3 m) drinking water reservoir located in Vinton, Vir-
ginia, USA, to SSS operation. We found that the SSS system increased hypolimnetic dis-
solved oxygen concentrations at a rate of ~1 mg/L/week without weakening stratiﬁcation
or warming the sediments. Moreover, the SSS system suppressed the release of reduced
iron and manganese, and likely phosphorus, from the sediments. In summary, SSS sys-
tems hold great promise for controlling hypolimnetic oxygen conditions in shallow lakes
and reservoirs.

Introduction
Hypolimnetic hypoxia (deﬁned as dissolved oxygen concen-
trations <2 mg/L; Wyman and Stevenson, 1991) in lakes and
reservoirs degrades water quality and can prevent recovery
from eutrophication (Cooke and Kennedy, 2001; Cooke et al.,
2005; Wetzel, 2001). Maintaining an oxygenated environment
in the bottom waters prevents the release of nutrients and

reduced metals e namely, phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), manga-
nese (Mn) e and their accumulation in the hypolimnion
(Matthews
and
Efﬂer,
2006;
McGinnis
and
Little,
2002;
Mortimer, 1941). Controlling these nutrients and metals is
essential for improving water quality. Phosphorus can stim-
ulate algal growth and exacerbate eutrophication (Schindler,
1977; Schindler et al., 2008; Smith, 1982), while Fe and Mn in
the hypolimnion can cause taste, odor, and color problems for
drinking water suppliers (AWWA, 1987; Zaw and Chiswell,
1999). Ultimately, maintaining an oxygenated hypolimnion
is paramount for controlling these nutrients and metals and
simplifying the water treatment process.
Hypolimnetic oxygenation systems are commonly used to
increase dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the hypo-
limnia of lakes and reservoirs (Beutel and Horne, 1999;
Singleton and Little, 2006). Hypolimnetic oxygenation sys-
tems aim to maintain thermal stratiﬁcation while adding ox-
ygen to bottom waters (Beutel and Horne, 1999). Two primary
advantages of hypolimnetic oxygenation systems are higher
oxygen solubility in comparison to hypolimnetic aeration
systems, and higher oxygen transfer efﬁciencies (percent up-
take of delivered oxygen; Beutel and Horne, 1999). As a result,
>30 hypolimnetic oxygenation systems have been deployed in
lakes and reservoirs around the world, as documented in the
literature (Liboriussen et al., 2009; Noll, 2011; Singleton and
Little, 2006; Yajima et al., 2009; Zaccara et al., 2007).
Despite its promise, the process of hypolimnetic oxygen-
ation has three major potential drawbacks e destratiﬁcation,
hypolimnetic warming, and induced sediment oxygen de-
mand e that must be taken into account when designing a
system. First, hypolimnetic oxygenation aims to raise the
oxygen content of the hypolimnion without destratifying the
overlying water column (Ashley, 1985). Such mixing could
result in the entrainment of nutrients that were once isolated
in the hypolimnion to the epilimnion, resulting in elevated
nutrient concentrations in the photic zone and increased
nutrient availability. Furthermore, partial destratiﬁcation in-
creases the hypolimnetic volume over which oxygen must be
delivered to maintain desired DO concentrations, leading to
inefﬁciency and added costs. Second, hypolimnetic oxygena-
tion aims to avoid warming of the hypolimnion, which could
lead to premature overturn, and poses a potential problem for
benthic, cold-water organisms (Beutel and Horne, 1999; Wu
et al., 2003). Third, hypolimnetic oxygenation may also stim-
ulate increases in sediment and water column oxygen uptake,
thereby accelerating hypolimnetic oxygen depletion and
diminishing overall performance of the system (Bryant et al.,
2011; Gantzer et al., 2009b). Although somewhat counter-
intuitive, hypolimnetic oxygenation systems can increase
oxygen demand by stimulating aerobic decomposition and
chemical demand (Gantzer et al., 2009b; Lorenzen and Fast,
1977; Moore et al., 1996).
There are several different types of oxygenation systems
that are commonly deployed in deep (>10 m) lakes and res-
ervoirs.
These
primarily
include
bubble-plume
diffusers
(linear and circular) and submerged down-ﬂow bubble contact
chambers such as the Speece Cone (reviewed by Beutel and
Horne, 1999; Singleton and Little, 2006). However, these
types of systems are generally only deployed in deep lakes and
reservoirs
because
shallow
(<10
m)
water
bodies
lack
sufﬁcient depth to ensure that bubbles of injected oxygen
dissolve in the hypolimnion or that thermal stratiﬁcation is
not disrupted by system operation (Beutel, 2006; Cooke et al.,
2005). Thus, for implementing hypolimnetic oxygenation in
shallow lakes and reservoirs, a technique known as side
stream supersaturation (SSS) represents a potential alterna-
tive (Beutel and Horne, 1999).
SSS may hold great promise for successful hypolimnetic
oxygenation of shallow ecosystems. This technique involves
withdrawing hypolimnetic water from the lake, injecting
concentrated oxygen gas at high pressure, and returning the
oxygenated water to the hypolimnion (Singleton and Little,
2006). Due to the small hypolimnetic volume in shallow
water bodies, SSS systems may be more effective than other
systems
in
increasing
hypolimnetic
DO
concentrations
because they can add more oxygen with low water ﬂow rate,
thereby
causing
less
mixing
and
maintaining
thermal
structure.
In a comprehensive review of published studies and other
reports, we found that side stream systems have been
deployed thus far in at least ﬁve lakes or reservoirs and three
river or tidal ecosystems worldwide (Table 1). We note the
difference in our review between side stream systems that
inject oxygen into the hypolimnion of water bodies at satu-
rated concentrations (hereafter, side stream hypolimnetic
oxygenation) and SSS systems, which inject oxygen at su-
persaturated concentrations.
The outcome of the previous side stream and SSS de-
ployments
has
been
mixed.
While
the
earliest
known
deployment in Ottoville Quarry in 1973 (Zmax ¼ 18 m)
demonstrated that a side stream system could successfully
increase hypolimnetic DO concentrations without destratiﬁ-
cation of the water column (Fast et al., 1975, 1977), later de-
ployments of side stream systems, one an SSS, in Attica
Reservoir (Fast and Lorenzen, 1976; Lorenzen and Fast, 1977),
Lake Serraia (Toffolon et al., 2013), and Lake Thunderbird
(OWRB, 2012, 2013), all exhibited premature destratiﬁcation
(Table
1).
Consequently,
there
has
been
no
successful
deployment of a side stream or SSS system in a shallow
(<10 m) lake or reservoir to date.
Given that most lakes and reservoirs worldwide are small
and shallow (Downing et al., 2006; Scheffer, 2004), and that
improving water quality is a major goal worldwide (MEA,
2005), we investigated the utility of SSS application in a
shallow drinking water reservoir. We had two primary ob-
jectives. First, we assessed if the SSS system could success-
fully overcome induced sediment oxygen demand to increase
hypolimnetic DO concentrations without triggering destrati-
ﬁcation or sediment warming. Second, we evaluated how well
the system prevented the release of Fe, Mn, and P from the
reservoir sediments.

Materials and methods
2.1.
Study site
Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR) is a small, eutrophic drinking
water reservoir near Vinton in Bedford County, southwestern
Virginia, USA (37 180 1200 N, 79 500 1400 W). FCR is operated and

maintained by the Western Virginia Water Authority (WVWA)
and provides drinking water for residents of Roanoke, VA. FCR
is located in an undisturbed, forested watershed and receives
water primarily from one inﬂowing stream. The reservoir has
a surface area of 1.19  101 km2, maximum depth of 9.3 m,
mean depth of 4 m, and a volume of 3.1  105 m3, making it
substantially smaller and shallower than other lakes and
reservoirs in which hypolimnetic oxygenation has been pre-
viously studied. Despite the reservoir's small size, FCR does
exhibit stable thermal stratiﬁcation, typically from May to
early October, producing a well-deﬁned and discrete hypo-
limnion suitable for oxygenation. Mean residence time in the
reservoir is 200e300 days. During its recent monitoring his-
tory, FCR has exhibited summer cyanobacterial blooms asso-
ciated with taste and odor problems and long periods of
hypolimnetic anoxia linked to internal loading of Fe, Mn,
and P.

Data collection and nutrient analysis
We monitored FCR twice a week during the experimental
period from April to September 2013. Water column depth
proﬁles of temperature, DO, conductivity, and turbidity were
measured at seven sites on a transect from the reservoir dam
to its upstream tributary (Fig. 1) using an SBE 19plus (Seabird
Electronics, Bellevue, WA) high-resolution (4 Hz sampling
rate) Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) proﬁler.
The response time of the DO probe on the CTD was 1.4 s at
20 C, allowing data to be collected at ~0.1 m increments from
the water's surface to just above the sediments. A YSI (YSI Inc.,
Yellow Springs, OH) ProODO meter was substituted for the
CTD's dissolved oxygen (DO) proﬁle measurements from 3 July
to 15 August and measured DO proﬁles at the seven sites on
0.5 m increments. Comparison of CTD and YSI proﬁles on the
same sampling days yielded nearly identical measurements of
DO (within 0.1 mg/L).
We collected water samples to measure total and soluble
Fe, Mn, and P concentrations along a depth proﬁle (at the eight
discharge depths of the reservoir: 0.1, 0.8, 1.6, 2.8, 3.8, 5.0, 6.2,
and 8.0 m) using a 1.2 L Kemmerer bottle (Wildlife Supply
Company, Yulee, FL) at the deep hole as well as in the up-
stream tributary before it entered the reservoir. Samples for
total and soluble analyses at each depth were poured directly
from the Kemmerer bottle into plastic bottles that had been
acid-washed with 1.2 N hydrochloric acid. Soluble samples
were ﬁltered through 0.7 mm Whatman GF/F ﬁlters, and total
and soluble samples were preserved with 15.9 N nitric acid
until analysis. We analyzed the samples for total and soluble

Fe and Mn following the EPA Method 200.8, Rev. 5.4 (1994)
using an Agilent 7700x ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). We analyzed the samples for total phosphorus (TP)
following the EPA Method 365.3 (1978) and soluble reactive
phosphate (SRP) on a spectrophotometer following the Quik-
Chem Method 10-115-10-1-B.
Finally, we measured the ﬂow rate into the reservoir from
the upstream tributary using a rectangular weir with a notch
width
of
1.10
m.
An
INW
Aquistar

pressure
sensor (INW, Kirkland, WA) recorded the water level above
the weir every 15 min, which we used to calculate the ﬂow
rate of the stream into the reservoir using Chow (1959) and
Grant (1991):
q ¼ K  ðL  0:2  HÞ  H1:5
(1)
where q is ﬂow rate (m3/min), K is 110.29, a unit conversion
constant, L is the crest length of the weir (m), and H is the head
on the weir (m). The residence time of FCR was calculated at
15 min increments using the ﬂow rate of the upstream tribu-
tary and assuming the reservoir volume was at full pond,
3.1  105 m3.
2.3.
Data analysis
We examined how SSS operation affected hypolimnetic oxy-
gen demand (HOD) and estimated the corresponding induced
oxygen demand (IOD) caused by SSS operation. HOD is the
rate of change of total oxygen content in the hypolimnion over
time, which is measured on both (1) a mass basis (HODmass)
yielding a rate in kg/day, and (2) a concentration basis
(HODconc) yielding a rate in mg/L/day. HOD encompasses all
oxygen-consuming processes in the hypolimnion, including
oxygen demand from sediment, the water column, and any
redox reactions.
We determined HOD and IOD by performing a regression
analysis on the volume-weighted oxygen content in the hypo-
limnion(followingthemethodsofGantzeretal.,2009b),andthen
compared HOD and IOD during multiple periods of SSS activa-
tion and deactivation. During periods without SSS operation, the
rate of change of hypolimnetic oxygen content (HODmass and
HODconc) was observed to decrease linearly. During SSS opera-
tion, the rate of oxygen addition from SSS operation was sub-
tracted from the observed hypolimnetic oxygen accumulation
rate, yielding HOD. IOD represents the increased demand above
background HOD (calculated only when the SSS was off), which
is used to validate the factor of safety employed during system
design.
Schmidt stability, an index of the strength of thermal strati-
ﬁcation (Idso, 1973), was calculated from the temperature pro-
ﬁles using Lake Analyzer (Read et al., 2011) in Matlab statistical
software (version R2013a 8.1.0.604; Mathworks, Natick, MA).
Schmidtstability (in J/m2) indicates the resistance to mechanical
mixing due to the potential energy inherent in the stratiﬁcation
of the water column, and was our primary metric for assessing
the effect of SSS operation on thermal stratiﬁcation.
2.3.1.
Determining thermocline depth and hypolimnetic
oxygen content
We calculated the hypolimnetic volume of the reservoir using
the discrete depth temperature data on each sampling day.
The thermocline depth was identiﬁed by analyzing tempera-
ture proﬁles and identifying the depth that exhibited the
maximum rate of change in temperature for each day,
following Wetzel (2001). The region of the reservoir below the
thermocline depth was identiﬁed as the hypolimnion.
We
determined hypolimnetic oxygen mass following
Gantzer et al. (2009b). As described above, dissolved oxygen
proﬁles were collected at seven sites along the length of the
reservoir with a CTD proﬁler (Fig. 1). We ﬁrst partitioned the
surface area and corresponding volume of the reservoir into
seven sections centered around each sampling site. Second,
we used the CTD proﬁles from each sampling site to create a
dataset of the DO concentration in 0.1 m thick layers in each
reservoir section on every sampling day. Third, we multiplied
the oxygen concentration in each 0.1 m layer by the respective
volume for that layer to calculate the hypolimnetic oxygen
mass. Summing the hypolimnetic layers for each section
yielded the total hypolimnetic oxygen mass for that section,
and summing all the hypolimnetic sections yielded the oxy-
gen mass for the total hypolimnion. Finally, the summed total
hypolimnion oxygen mass was divided by the total hypo-
limnetic
volume
to
calculate
the
volume-weighted

hypolimnetic oxygen concentration for the reservoir on each
sampling day.
We calculated hypolimnetic oxygen addition and depletion
rates using the regression protocol of Lorenzen and Fast (1977),
following the methods outlined by Gantzer et al. (2009b).
Because hypolimnetic volume was observed to ﬂuctuate be-
tween sampling days due to thermocline movement, HOD was
calculatedboth ona mass basis(HODmass) corrected forvolume
ﬂuctuations and on a concentration basis (HODconc) using the
volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen concentration multi-
plied by the mean volume for the sampling time period. Both
methods yielded similar estimates, within 1%, and thus we
report the average of the two calculated HOD estimates here.

Hypolimnetic oxygen system description and
operation
The SSS system was designed and deployed in FCR in
September 2012 under the direction of Gantzer Water Re-
sources Engineering, LLC (Kirkland, WA) and Mobley Engi-
neering, Inc. (Norris, TN).
2.4.1.
SSS system components
SSS overview: The SSS system installed at FCR consisted of
six main components: a submersible pump, inlet piping,
oxygen source, oxygen contact chamber, outlet piping, and
distribution header (Fig. 2). SSS operation can be summa-
rized as follows. First, hypolimnetic water from a depth of
8.5 m was drawn by a submersible pump into the inlet
piping, which transported the water into the oxygen contact
chamber. In the oxygen contact chamber, oxygen gas from
the oxygen source was injected into the water, resulting in
oxygenated water that was supersaturated relative to the
oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion. The oxygenated
water exited the oxygen contact chamber through the outlet
piping to the distribution header, which was positioned at
the same depth as the submersible piping (8.5 m). The dis-
tribution header was where the oxygenated water was
injected back into the hypolimnion and was located at the
end of the outlet piping. Details for each of the six compo-
nents are given below.
Submersible pump: Water was withdrawn from the hypo-
limnion into the inlet piping at a depth of 8.5 m by a Franklin
Electric FPS 4400 (10.2 cm) high-capacity submersible pump
(Franklin Electric, Fort Wayne, IN) with a corrosion-resistant
motor and a delivery capacity of up to 227 liters per minute
(LPM). We chose to use a submersible pump for the SSS
because a submersible pump, unlike a conventional surface
pump, would not lose suction capacity if the reservoir volume
was drawn down during drought conditions. A Varispeed P7
pump controller (Yaskawa America, Inc., Waukegan, IL) was
used to control and program pump operation. An INW 98i
pressure transducer was installed at the highest point of the
inlet piping and connected to the pump controller to enable
the pump to be pressure-controlled.
Inlet and outlet piping: The inlet and outlet piping systems
were each composed of anchoring attached to a three-pipe
conﬁguration of a separate supply pipe (inlet or outlet), a
ballast pipe, and a buoyancy pipe connected together. The
anchoring system consisted of concrete weights connected to
the three-pipe conﬁguration with stainless steel cables, and
enabled the pipes to be suspended at a ﬁxed depth in the
water column (8.5 m depth, or 0.8 m above the reservoir sed-
iments). Of the three pipes in the three-pipe conﬁguration,
only the supply pipe was connected into and out of the oxygen
contact chamber for the inlet and outlet piping systems,
respectively. The supply and ballast pipes were constructed of
two 5.1 cm standard-dimension ratio (SDR)-11 high-density
polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, and the buoyancy pipe was con-
structed from 7.6 cm SDR-21 HDPE pipe.
Fig. 2 e A cross-sectional schematic of the SSS system in Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR). The SSS system installed at FCR
consisted of six main components: a submersible pump, inlet piping, oxygen source, oxygen contact chamber, outlet
piping, and distribution header. As noted in the text, hypolimnetic water from a depth of 8.5 m was drawn by a submersible
pump into the inlet piping, which transported the water into the oxygen contact chamber. In the oxygen contact chamber,
oxygen gas from the oxygen source was injected into the water, resulting in oxygenated water that was supersaturated
relative to the oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion. The oxygenated water exited the oxygen contact chamber
through the outlet piping to the distribution header, which was positioned at the same depth of the submersible piping
(8.5 m). The distribution header was located at the end of the outlet piping and was where the oxygenated water was
injected back into the hypolimnion.

Traditionally, these piping systems are used for distrib-
uting air or oxygen gas to the water column through the
supply pipe, and thus the presence of a gas in the supply pipe
doubles as ballast. For this system, however, since the mode of
oxygen addition was via oxygenated water, an additional pipe
ﬁlled with gas was needed for ballast. The ballast pipe ensured
sufﬁcient ﬂotation to suspend the three-pipe conﬁguration
above the reservoir sediments. The larger buoyancy pipe was
designed to be able to bring the entire system to the surface,
anchors included, for maintenance and was controlled by the
volume of water in the pipe. When the water in the buoyancy
pipe was ejected, the piping system would rise to the reser-
voir's surface; it would then be ﬁlled with water to sink the
system back to the 8.5 m depth in the hypolimnion.
Oxygen source: The oxygen source for the SSS system was a
Centrox (AirSep, Buffalo, NY) pressure swing adsorption (PSA)
unit. The PSA was capable of delivering enriched oxygen gas
(93% nominal purity) up to 15 LPM. The Centrox unit was
microprocessor controlled and fed a 227 L volume receiving
tank, which was connected to the oxygen contact chamber
through an MCP-100SLPM-D-I-485 mass controller (Alicat
Scientiﬁc, Tucson, AZ).
Oxygen contact chamber: The oxygen contact chamber was
constructed from HDPE piping increasing in diameter from
5.1 cm at the top to 30.5 cm at the bottom, with an overall
length of 2.7 m.
Distribution header: The distribution header was located at
the end of the outlet piping and used evenly spaced 4:1
eductor nozzles (BEX Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) to eject the
oxygenated water into the hypolimnion while promoting
uniform oxygen distribution. Eductor nozzles were chosen for
this application for two reasons: 1) to provide a near-instant
dilution of the oxygenated water, which was supersaturated
relative to in situ conditions, into the hypolimnion; and 2) to
promote mixing throughout the hypolimnion via induced
ﬂow. For every 1 L of pressurized oxygenated water pumped
through an eductor nozzle, 4 L of non-oxygenated water from
the hypolimnion were suctioned into the nozzle, resulting in
5 L of volume ejected from the nozzle into the reservoir. Thus,
for example, if the pressurized ﬂow from the submersible
pump was 10 LPM, the eductor portion of the nozzle suctioned
40 LPM of water from the hypolimnion into the nozzle, and the
ﬂow exiting the nozzle was 50 LPM.
We designed the distribution header to cover the length of
the deepest region of the reservoir (see Fig. 1) and positioned it
to promote uniform mixing throughout the hypolimnion. The
distribution header was 76.2 m long with 15 evenly spaced
eductor nozzles installed at 4.5 m intervals on alternate sides
of the pipe at 8.5 m depth. The nozzles were oriented at a 10
angle above horizontal to minimize re-suspension of sedi-
ment. The eductor nozzles were sized to maintain adequate
back pressure for optimal oxygen transfer in the contact
chamber, while at the same time reducing the exit velocity to
avoid sediment re-suspension and thermocline mixing in the
hypolimnion.
Ideally, it would be useful to compare the system design
and components used in this FCR SSS system with the other
side stream systems deployed previously (Table 1). However,
we found from our literature review that the engineering de-
signs of those systems were not published or publically
available, or they were lacking sufﬁcient detail to conduct a
full comparison.
2.4.2.
SSS operational design
The SSS design was based on historical oxygen demand,
determined from regression analysis of the volume-weighted
HOD during 2008, using the same methods that were applied
in 2013 and described above. During the 2008 sampling
campaign, we collected DO proﬁles bi-weekly at the reservoir's
deepest site in June and July and observed that the hypolim-
nion became anoxic on 28 July. We applied a safety factor of
ﬁve to the background HOD to account for induced demand
from SSS operation (Gantzer et al., 2009b) and make-up ca-
pacity. Make-up capacity provides an oxygenation system
with the ability to recover DO content following an unex-
pected period of shut down. From the 2008 sampling, we
determined that the resulting required oxygen input capacity
for summer conditions in FCR was 25 kg/d.
Following the oxygen input requirement determination,
we calculated the pumping capacity, minimum velocities for
dispersed
bubble
ﬂow,
and
system
operating
pressures
needed for successful oxygen transfer into the side stream
water ﬂow. We modeled the oxygen contact chamber and
corresponding distribution piping with CSFSIM (Compressible
Steady Flow SIMulation). CSFSIM modeling was used to
determine the duration of time water spent in the distribution
pipe, head losses, water velocities, and contact time in the
oxygen contact chamber. Henry's law was used to determine
the theoretical oxygen concentration for different water ﬂow
rates, pressures, and maximum summer temperatures, which
follows similar estimates by Ashley (1985) and Ashley et al.
(1987).
2.4.3.
SSS system startup and testing
During SSS system testing, the oxygen concentration leaving
the distribution header was predicted using observed water
and applied gas ﬂow rates, and compared to saturation con-
ditions using Henry's law and pressure and temperature
values measured with the pressure transducer installed in the
inlet piping. Hamilton Oxyferm FDA ARC (Hamilton Company,
Reno, NV) oxygen sensors were positioned on the efﬂuent of
the oxygen contact chamber and just prior to the ﬁrst nozzle
to validate oxygen transfer capacity and identify system
operational limitations. Differences measured between the
two readings provided operational guidelines and indicated
the overall oxygen transfer efﬁciency in the oxygen contact
chamber.
We activated the SSS system on 14 May 2013 and operated
it continuously for ﬁve weeks. The system was deactivated on
20 June 2013 and remained off until it was reactivated on 1
August 2013. After the system was reactivated a second time,
it remained on for the duration of the experimental moni-
toring period.
During both activation periods, the SSS was operated to
add oxygen to the hypolimnion at 25 kg/d with a pump ﬂow
rate set at 227 LPM. At this pump ﬂow rate, the mean hypo-
limnetic volume during both activation periods (4.4  107 L)
was actively circulated through the SSS system every 133
days. However, the active circulation induced in the hypo-
limnion from pump discharge through the eductor nozzles
w a t e r r e s e a r c h 6 7 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 1 2 9 e1 4 3

was estimated to be 1135 LPM, thus mixing the mean hypo-
limnetic volume every 26 days.

Results
3.1.
Dissolved oxygen and thermal structure
At the beginning of our sampling period in early April 2013, DO
was uniformly distributed throughout an isothermal water
column (Fig. 3). As thermal stratiﬁcation intensiﬁed in April
and early May, volume-weighted hypolimnetic DO concen-
trations steadily declined at a mean rate of 0.13 mg/L/d (Fig. 4;
we excluded the ﬁrst three sampling days from this calcula-
tion because thermal stratiﬁcation did not fully develop until
25 April). Prior to SSS activation on 14 May, DO concentrations
in the hypolimnion decreased to 5.2 mg/L just above the
reservoir sediments.
We observed that SSS activation successfully increased
hypolimnetic DO concentrations up to 600 m from the SSS
system (Fig. 5) without warming the bottom waters or des-
tratifying the water column (Fig. 6). SSS activation on 14 May
resulted in a steady increase in volume-weighted hypo-
limnetic DO, which linearly increased throughout the opera-
tional phase at a mean rate of 0.18 mg/L/d (Fig. 4). Due to the
4:1 eductor nozzles on the distribution header, SSS operation
resulted in a well-mixed hypolimnion, with uniform DO con-
centrations between the thermocline and the sediments.
Oxygen concentrations increased both above and below the
distribution header at 8.5 m depth.
Importantly, SSS activation did not decrease thermal sta-
bility. On the contrary, Schmidt stability increased throughout
the operational phase to its seasonal maximum (48.34 J/m2) in
early July (Fig. 6). This was located at a mean depth of 4.7 m
throughout the ﬁrst operational phase and ranged from 4.4 to
5.0 m. A deﬁned metalimnetic oxygen minimum between ~3
and 4 m depth developed and persisted throughout this
operational phase, indicating minimal to no mixing between
the hypolimnion and epilimnion.
SSS deactivation on 20 June led to an immediate decrease
in DO concentrations (Fig. 3), with the greatest DO depletion
occurring near the sediments. During this phase, volume-
weighted hypolimnetic DO linearly decreased at a mean rate
of 0.18 mg/L/d (Fig. 4), resulting in hypoxic conditions
throughout the hypolimnion by 35 days after SSS deactivation.
However, DO concentrations at the sediments decreased
much more rapidly than in the bulk hypolimnion. Within two
weeks after SSS deactivation, the DO concentration had
decreased from 11.7 to 3.9 mg/L just above the reservoir sed-
iments, at a rate of 0.57 mg/L/day. Similarly, hypoxia in the
metalimnetic region intensiﬁed during this period, from 8.8 to
1.4 mg/L. Immediately prior to SSS reactivation on 1 August,
DO concentrations were <0.5 mg/L at the sediments. This
period also coincided with 7 large (>1 cm/day) rain events,
temporarily causing small ﬂuctuations in Schmidt stability
(Fig. 6).

We reactivated the SSS system on 1 August, which again
triggered an immediate increase in DO and restoration of well-
mixed conditions in the hypolimnion (Fig. 3). During the sec-
ond activation phase, volume-weighted hypolimnetic DO line-
arly increased at the mean rate of 0.09 mg/L/d (Fig. 4). The
sedimentewater interface exhibited a rapid increase in DO from
0.42 to 4.67 mg/L in the 4 days after activation. Similar to the ﬁrst
operational phase, the thermocline was located at a mean depth
of 4.9 m (ranging from 4.6 to 5.6 m) during the second operational
phase, with no major visible effects of the SSS on Schmidt sta-
bility until thermal stratiﬁcation naturally weakened in mid-
September.
3.2.
Hypolimnetic oxygen demand
We observed an increase in hypolimnetic oxygen demand
(HOD) during both SSS operational phases compared to the
deactivation phases. The HOD in May prior to system activa-
tion was 6.5 kg/d, whereas HOD in the ﬁrst activation phase
was 18.6 kg/d, representing an increase of 186%. Similarly,
HOD was 6.9 kg/d and 20.7 kg/d during the second deactiva-
tion and activation phases, respectively, representing an in-
crease in HOD of 200% when the SSS was activated. During the
ﬁrst operational phase, the induced oxygen demand (IOD),
which represents the relative increase in oxygen consumption
due to SSS system operation, was estimated to be 2.86, while
the IOD in the second operational phase was 3.01.
3.3.
Iron, manganese, and phosphorus
Throughout the sampling period, we observed that total and
soluble fractions of both Fe and Mn exhibited similar patterns
of nutrient release from the sediments (Fig. 7AeD). Fig. 7 dis-
plays concentrations of nutrients and metals during the
sampling period. The data are interpolated between sampling
days, which are denoted by inverted black triangles, and be-
tween sampling depths. The observed hypolimnetic Fe and
Mn concentrations throughout the sampling period are dis-
played in Fig. 8(AeD) without interpolation.
From the beginning of May until the end of July, the con-
centrations of both fractions of Fe and Mn were below 1 mg/L.
On 1 August, after 7 days of hypoxia at the sedimentewater
interface during SSS deactivation, we observed a large increase
in Fe and Mn at the two deeper sampling depths. At 8 m depth,
total and soluble Fe concentrations reached maximaof 11.6 mg/
L and 2.2 mg/L, respectively, while total and soluble Mn con-
centrations reached maxima of 4.7 mg/L and 4.7 mg/L, respec-
tively. As shown in Fig. 8, when the SSS was activated on 1
August, Fe and Mn decreased rapidly, and the concentrations of
Fe and Mn at the three hypolimnetic sampling depths tended to
converge within 1 week after reactivation, indicating mixing of
the hypolimnion. During the remainder of the sampling period,
total Fe concentrations in the hypolimnion remained between
1.5 and 2 mg/L, while total Mn concentrations remained near
1 mg/L in the hypolimnion. Likewise, soluble Fe and Mn con-
centrations remained lower than 1 mg/L after 1 August.
In contrast to Fe and Mn, we observed more variable patterns
in TP and SRP during the sampling period (Fig. 7E, F). Release of P
from the sediments, as indicated by an increase in P concentra-
tions at the bottom of the hypolimnion, was greater overall
duringSSSdeactivationphasesthanactivationphaseswithpeak
TP and SRP concentrations of 98.0 mg/L and 9.8 mg/L, respectively,
at 8 m depth on 25 July (Fig. 8E, F). We also observed elevated P
concentrations in the epilimnion during the second SSS deactiva

TP in the surface waters reached a maximum of 118.8 mg/L and
SRP of 22.2 mg/L at 0.8 m on 11 July, a day after the upstream
tributary exhibited the maximum ﬂow rate observed during the
entire sampling period (21.4 m3/min) due to a large rain storm
(10 cm over the preceding 24 h). Despite this variability in the
epilimnion, the total loads of P in the hypolimnion decreased by
50%within1weekafterSSSreactivation,representingadecrease
in 1.14 kg of P from the hypolimnion. No increases in any of the
measured elements e Fe, Mn, or P e were observed in the hy-
polimnion during the second oxygenation period.

Discussion
4.1.
SSS successfully oxygenated the hypolimnion of FCR
Our results indicate that SSS operation was successful in
increasing
hypolimnetic
DO
concentrations
in
FCR,
a
eutrophic, shallow reservoir. The two major issues that
plagued previous side stream deployments e namely, warm-
ing of the hypolimnion and altered thermal stratiﬁcation
(Table 1) e were not observed during the sampling period.
Schmidt stability throughout the activation and deactivation
phases reﬂected a pattern typical of seasonal variability,
rather than a response to SSS operation. We observed that
stratiﬁcation continued to strengthen during the ﬁrst SSS
operational period, demonstrating that the SSS system was
able to successfully oxygenate the hypolimnion uniformly
from the sediments to the thermocline without causing the
entire water column to mix. The thermal structure was
slightly disturbed in July; however, this disturbance coincided
with several large rain events and was likely not related to SSS
operation.
Furthermore, the consistent strength of the thermocline
was likely why a metalimnetic oxygen minimum developed
throughout the summer months in FCR. Beginning in July,
algae from the epilimnion began to accumulate in the
Fig. 5 e Dissolved oxygen concentrations on a transect up the reservoir from the side stream supersaturation (SSS) system
to the upstream tributary on four select dates: (A) 14 May 2013, immediately before the SSS was activated for the ﬁrst time;
(B) 13 June, after the SSS was continuously activated for 30 days; (C) 16 August, after the SSS had been deactivated for 42
days and subsequently reactivated for 15 days; and (D) 25 September, after the SSS had been reactivated for 55 days.

thermocline and decompose, as evident from the DO data
(Fig. 3). This detrital buildup resulted in a disproportionate
oxygen demand at this depth, resulting in a metalimnetic
oxygen minimum and further demonstrating the strength of
the thermocline.
As shown in Table 1, three out of the four previously
installed side stream systems resulted in premature destra-
tiﬁcation. In the three systems that failed, the mixing energy
introduced into the hypolimnion was presumably too high,
resulting in substantial erosion of the thermocline, warming
of the hypolimnion, and subsequent mixing of the destabi-
lized water column. In contrast, the SSS system in FCR added
the required amount of oxygen in a relatively low volume of
water. One of the advantages of SSS over other hypolimnetic
oxygenation systems is that the DO can be raised to higher
levels by increasing the pressure in the oxygen contact
chamber; i.e., a large amount of oxygen can be added in a
small amount of water. Although the DO in the water being
delivered to the hypolimnion may be supersaturated at its
discharge depth, the discharge jets rapidly dilute the DO,
preventing the formation of gas bubbles that are large enough
to escape from the hypolimnion. At the same time, energy is
needed to spread the oxygenated water throughout the hy-
polimnion, raising DO to the required concentration. Thus,
successful design requires a balance between providing suf-
ﬁcient energy to spread the oxygen, but not so much that
thermal stratiﬁcation in the reservoir is destabilized. As noted
above, it would be useful to compare the system design and
components used in our SSS system with the other side
stream systems deployed previously (Table 1). However, we
found from our literature review that the engineering designs
of those systems were not published or publically available, or
they
were
lacking
sufﬁcient
detail
to
conduct
a
full
comparison.
Prior to the activation of the SSS in FCR, the side stream
system deployed in Ottoville Quarry was the only known
system that had successfully increased hypolimnetic DO
concentrations while preserving thermal stratiﬁcation. Otto-
ville Quarry's maximum depth (18 m) was twice as deep as
FCR, thus possessing a larger hypolimnetic volume for
oxygenation. Unfortunately, Fe, Mn, and P concentrations
were not reported for Ottoville Quarry, so it is unknown if that
SSS system was able to suppress internal loading. In addition,
little information is available on its SSS engineering design or
operation. However, it was reported that the oxygen depletion
averaged 1.0 mg/L/week and oxygen addition averaged 0.9 mg/
L/week in Ottoville Quarry (Fast et al., 1975), which were
coincidentally the same depletion and addition rates observed
in FCR. While the system deployed in Ottoville Quarry was
based on side stream pumping, not SSS, it provides an
important early example of the great potential of side stream
hypolimnetic oxygenation in lakes and reservoirs.
4.2.
Higher induced oxygen demand during oxygenation
Hypolimnetic
oxygen
demand
encompasses
all
oxygen-
consuming processes in the hypolimnion. In FCR, HOD is
likely driven primarily by organic matter decomposition
(Davis et al., 1987; Gantzer et al., 2009b). During SSS operation,
we observed increased HOD, likely due to higher rates of

organic matter decomposition at the sediments (biological
demand) and increased chemical demand from nutrient and
metal release. Higher oxygen demand during oxygenation has
been observed in several other water bodies, including
Carvins Cove Reservoir and Spring Hollow Reservoir (Gantzer
et al., 2009b) and Newman Lake (Moore et al., 1996), and is
thought to be able to exceed an induced oxygen demand, or
IOD, of 6 (Gantzer et al., 2009b). The increase in IOD of ~3 that

we observed in FCR is within the range of previously observed
IODs, also referred to as the induced HOD factor, reported
from other oxygenation systems in the literature (1.5e4.0;
Beutel, 2003; Gantzer et al., 2009b; Moore et al., 1996). Shallow
reservoirs such as FCR are expected to experience induced
HOD factors at the high end of this range due to the larger
fraction
of
oxygen
demand
exerted
at
the
sediments
compared to the overlying shallow water column (Beutel,
2003).
Between the two operational periods, we observed a very
small increase in the IOD from 2.86 to 3.01, most likely due to
the greater biological and chemical oxygen demand in the
hypolimnion during the second operational phase compared
to the ﬁrst operational phase. In the second operational phase,
the water column was much warmer, thereby accelerating
respiration and decomposition processes, and there was
much higher chemical demand: reduced Fe, Mn, and P con-
centrations were much higher in the hypolimnion than in the
ﬁrst operational phase. Despite the increase in HOD due to SSS
operation, the observed ability of the SSS system to linearly
raise DO concentrations during both operational phases in-
dicates that the SSS system design appears to be adequate in
its capacity to overcome the corresponding increases in oxy-
gen demand in FCR, regardless of the starting hypolimnetic
oxygen concentrations.
Although SSS operation increased HOD in this short term
experiment, it has been hypothesized that HOD will decrease
after several years of oxygenation (Gantzer et al., 2009b). Long-
term (several year) monitoring programs should be imple-
mented to determine the behavior of HOD after continuous
SSS operation.
4.3.
SSS suppressed the internal loading of reduced
elements
Our data indicate that SSS operation was able to suppress Fe
and Mn release from the sediments. After seven days of
hypoxia at the sedimentewater interface, soluble Fe and Mn
release coincided with maximum oxygen depletion prior to
SSS reactivation. Upon the reactivation of the SSS on 1 August,
the release of Fe and Mn, and potentially P, decreased from the
sediments, indicating that the SSS was able to suppress
additional internal loading.
During the entire sampling period, almost all of the total
Mn in the hypolimnion was in the soluble form, while most of
the total Fe was in the particulate form because Fe oxidizes
much more rapidly than Mn (Davison, 1993; Balzer, 1982;
Bryant et al., 2011). Evidence of the different kinetic rates is
shown in Fig. 8 following reactivation of the SSS on 1 August.
First, the extreme vertical gradients in the concentrations of
both soluble and particulate metals were essentially elimi-
nated before the next sampling event on 7 August, indicating
that the hypolimnion was close to completely mixed due to
SSS operation. As shown in Fig. 3, the mixing from the SSS also
eliminated the oxygen concentration gradient in the hypo-
limnion, exposing the soluble Fe and Mn initially present in
the anoxic bottom of the hypolimnion to higher oxygen con-
centrations. Simultaneously, oxygen introduced by the SSS
raised the mean oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion. As
a result, the soluble Fe concentrations decreased slowly,
presumably forming particulate Fe. Indeed, total Fe continued
to increase at 8 m depth until 21 August, suggesting an initial
accumulation of suspended particulate Fe forming as a result
of rapid oxidation in the bottom of the reservoir. After 28
August, total Fe began to decrease in the hypolimnion, sug-
gesting that particulate Fe was removed from the hypolim-
nion via settling onto the reservoir sediments.
The different behavior of the total and soluble Mn con-
centrations in the hypolimnion is quite noticeable in Fig. 8.
Although the vast majority of the measured Mn was in the
soluble form throughout the entire monitoring period, the
vertical hypolimnetic gradient in Mn was again eliminated by
the initial mixing following SSS reactivation on 1 August. In
contrast to Fe, however, the soluble Mn concentration
remained relatively constant for the remainder of the sam-
pling period.
Adding oxygen to the hypolimnion of a lake or reservoir
does not stop the reduction of Fe and Mn. What it does do,
when effectively applied, is to push the oxiceanoxic boundary
out of the water column and into the sediments (Gantzer et al.,
2009a; Bryant et al., 2011). This means that the oxidation
process due to oxygenation can begin within the sediments,
effectively reducing the accumulation of soluble Fe and Mn in
the water column. The fact that Fe oxidizes much more
rapidly than Mn (Davison, 1993; Balzer, 1982; Bryant et al.,
2011) means that it is easier to control the accumulation of
soluble Fe in the hypolimnion than it is to control the accu-
mulation of soluble Mn. Beginning oxygenation early in the
summer prior to the onset of thermal stratiﬁcation may be an
effective strategy to prevent the accumulation of soluble
metals in the hypolimnion.
The suppression of Fe and Mn internal loading and accu-
mulation in the water column by hypolimnetic oxygenation
was also reported in Carvins Cove Reservoir, a reservoir with a
linear bubble-plume diffuser system (Bryant et al., 2011;
Gantzer et al., 2009a). However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, there have been no reports of the successful control of Fe
and Mn e or P e due to SSS or side stream operation.
It is not clear why there was a 6-week delay in Fe and Mn
internal loading during the deactivation period in July, despite
prolonged hypoxia at the sedimentewater interface. One
explanation may be that our deepest nutrient and metal
samples were collected 1.3 m above the reservoir sediments,
and therefore there was likely nutrient and metal release that
we were unable to observe. Another plausible explanation is
that there may have been a shift in the sediment microbial
community as a result of oxygenation, altering nutrient
transformations and sediment release. As observed in Carvins
Cove Reservoir, the delayed response in nutrient release may
be explained by microbes adapting to altered ﬂuxes in oxygen
concentrations (Bryant et al., 2012).
Our data suggest that SSS operation may have altered P
release from FCR sediments, but the evidence was not as
conclusive as it was for Fe and Mn. Throughout July, during
the second deactivation phase, FCR received high external P
loads due to large rain events, which potentially may have
contributed P to the hypolimnion. However, the strong ther-
mal structure throughout this period, as demonstrated by the
metalimnetic oxygen minimum, likely prevented entrain-
ment of P from epilimnion to hypolimnion: consequently, it is
w a t e r r e s e a r c h 6 7 ( 2 0 1 4 ) 1 2 9 e1 4 3
141

unlikely that these external nutrients entering FCR during the
rain events reached the hypolimnion. Furthermore, the much
shorter hydraulic residence time of the reservoir during the
rain events in mid-July further supports our hypothesis that
the external P loads did not contribute to the increased P
observed in the hypolimnion. The residence time during these
rain events decreased from a mean of 247 days to approxi-
mately 10 days, and in turn likely ﬂushed the external loads of
P out of the reservoir quickly. The increase in epilimnetic P
due to the storm events occurred 14 days before the largest
increase in P at the sediments (Fig. 7E); therefore, with a
residence time of 10 days and strong thermocline at that time,
those epilimnetic and hypolimnetic P dynamics were likely
not linked to one another.
5.
Conclusion
Our data strongly suggest that SSS is a viable option for
improving water quality in FCR, a shallow, eutrophic drinking
water reservoir. However, longer-term studies are recom-
mended to evaluate the efﬁcacy of SSS operation. Speciﬁcally,
multiple years of monitoring will be required to determine if
HOD decreases over time, as well as if long-term hypolimnetic
oxygenation is able to suppress the internal loading of P. In
summary,
side
stream
supersaturation
hypolimnetic
oxygenation systems may be a favorable management strat-
egy for shallow (<10 m) water bodies.

 to be a serious

 to  water  quality  managers,
 and  remedial

sures
 that  are  ecologically
 sound,
 economically
 feasible,  and  efﬁcient
 in  responding
 to  the  scale  and

 of the  problem
 are  required
 for  their  control.
 Here,  we  evaluated
 the  potential
 of  a  new  technique
to
 adequately
 mix  the water  column  and  control  cyanobacterial
 blooms,
 employing
 a  surface-mounted
solar-powered
 water
 mixer  (SWM).
 Flow  dynamics,
 thermal

 of  the water  column  and  phyto-
plankton
 photo-physiology
 were compared
 before  and during  operation
 of the  SWM  in  Falling

Reservoir
 to determine
 whether  the  device
 helps
 weaken

 deepen  surface

 and  entrain
 surface

 resulted
 in  weak

 ﬁelds
 to  a lateral

 of  5  m  from
 the device,  to
a
 depth  of 1.5  m  from  the  surface.  Moreover,
 the  mixing  minimized
 the  surface

 temperatures
 by
approximately
 2 ◦C and  deepened
 the
 surface

 The  results
 showed
that
 the  SWM
 has  limited

 and  is unable  to adequately
 mix  lakes  and  reservoirs

 Introduction
Harmful
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
 are
 now
 a
 global
 problem,
 as
their
 occurrence
 and
 intensity
 is
 increasing
 and
 some
 species
 are
expanding
 geographically
 (Heisler
 et
 al.,
 2008;
 Brookes
 and
 Carey,
2011;
 Paerl
 et
 al.,
 2011).
 These
 blooms,
 primarily
 driven
 by
 nutri-
ent
 over-enrichment
 (Heisler
 et
 al.,
 2008)
 and
 warm,
 thermally
stratiﬁed
 conditions
 in
 water
 bodies
 (Mooij
 et
 al.,
 2005);
 threaten
ecological
 integrity
 (Havens,
 2008) and
 economic
 sustainability
of
 water
 resources
 (Dodds
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 Cyanobacteria
 are
 also
 a
cause
 of
 concern
 for
 human
 and
 animal
 health
 because
 of
 risks
of
 exposure
 to
 a
 variety
 of

 (Codd,
 1995;

130
 years
 since
 the
 ﬁrst
 reporting
 of
 harmful
 cyanobacteria
 and
its
 toxicity
 in
 the
 scientiﬁc
 literature
 (Francis,
 1878),
 water
 man-
agers
 still
 search
 for
 innovative
 and
 effective
 techniques
 to
 prevent
cyanobacterial
 blooms
 in
 sustainable
 ways.
 Not
 surprisingly,
 some
recent
 studies
 have
 emphasized
 the
 need
 for
 additional
 research
to
 improve
 blooms
 prevention
 and
 water
 quality
 restoration
 tech-
niques
 (Hudnell,
 2008,
 2009).
A
 number
 of
 ecological
 engineering
 techniques
 have
 been
 used
to
 successfully
 control
 cyanobacteria,
 for
 example,
 by
 using
 chem-
icals
 such
 as
 hydrogen
 peroxide
 (Barrington
 et
 al.,
 2013),
 infusing
fungus
 in
 water
 column
 for
 co-culture
 with
 cyanobacteria
 (Jia
 et
 al.,
2010),
 and
 with
 biomanipulation
 by
 introducing
 ﬁsh
 to
 increase
the
 grazing
 pressure
 on
 cyanobacteria
 (Ke
 et
 al.,
 2009).
 However,
widespread
 application
 of
 these
 techniques
 could
 be
 limited
because
 of
 environmental
 concerns
 associated
 with
 chemical
 use,
likelihood
 of
 more
 resistant
 cyanobacterial
 strain
 succession,
 and
difﬁculties
 in
 maintaining
 adequate
 ﬁsh
 stocks,
 among
 others.
Measures
 that
 target

for
 controlling
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
 (Visser
 et

 1996;
 Sherman
et
 al.,
 2000;
 Jungo
 et
 al.,
 2001).
 The
 extent
 of
 mixing
 in
 water
 bodies,
which
 regulates
 the
 vertical
 density
 structure
 and
 light
 availability
for
 phytoplankton
 growth
 in
 the
 euphotic
 zone,
 plays
 a
 key
 role
in
 cyanobacterial
 control.
 The
 primary
 aim
 of
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 for
controlling
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
 is,
 however,
 to
 reduce
 the
 net
light
 exposure
 of
 phytoplankton
 to
 light-limit
 their
 growth,
 which
can
 be
 achieved
 by
 keeping
 phytoplankton
 below
 a
 depth
 at
 which
photosynthesis
 is
 minimal
 or
 absent.
 The
 ‘ﬂuorescence
 ratio’
 iden-
tiﬁed
 by
 Harris
 (1980)
 provides
 information
 on
 the
 previous
 light
history
 of
 algal
 cells
 and
 can
 therefore
 be
 used
 to
 provide
 insight
into
 the
 degree
 of
 mixing
 of
 the
 water
 column.
The
 
ﬂuorescence
 
ratio
 
is
 
the
 
3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-
dimethylurea
 (DCMU)
 sensitive
 chlorophyll
 a
 ﬂuorescence
 divided
by
 the
 in
 vivo
 chlorophyll
 ﬂuorescence,
 which
 typically
 displays
a
 vertical
 gradient
 during
 stratiﬁed
 conditions
 as
 the
 ﬂuorescence
ratio
 from
 surface
 phytoplankton
 populations
 is
 depressed.
 Since
the
 time-scales
 of
 mixing
 and
 photochemical
 processes
 of
 phyto-
plankton
 are
 similar
 (Denman
 and
 Gargett,
 1983),
 Harris
 (1986)
concluded
 that
 the
 ﬂuorescence
 ratio
 could
 be
 used
 as
 an
 indi-
cator
 of
 mixing
 in
 surface
 waters.
 With
 advances
 in
 ﬂuorometry,
the
 physiological
 basis
 for
 Harris’s
 observations
 is
 better
 under-
stood
 (Oliver
 and
 Whittington,
 1998)
 and
 variable
 ﬂuorescence
 has
been
 used
 to
 determine
 rates
 of
 mixing,
 phytoplankton
 entrain-
ment
 and
 photoinhibition
 (Whittington
 et
 al.,
 2000;
 Brookes
 et
 al.,
2003;
 Regel
 et

Although
 several
 techniques
 employing
 a
 range
 of
 mechanical
devices
 are
 in
 use
 to
 induce
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 in
 lakes
 and
 reservoirs
as
 means
 to
 control
 the
 blooms,
 energy
 associated
 with
 contin-
uous
 operation
 of
 these
 devices
 is
 a
 substantial
 cost
 for
 water
utilities.
 A
 new
 generation
 of
 technique
 being
 used
 widely
 to
 con-
trol
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
 is
 a
 solar
 energy
 driven
 water
 mixing
device,
 in
 an
 apparent
 attempt
 to
 reduce
 the
 costs
 of
 energy.
 How-
ever,
 the
 mixing
 capacity
 of
 such
 technique
 for
 blooms
 control
 is
not
 widely
 proven
 in
 the
 literature.
 In
 this
 study,
 we
 present
 and
discuss
 results
 from
 a
 full
 scale,
 in
 situ
 study
 to
 evaluate
 the
 mixing
ability
 of
 a
 surface-mounted
 solar-powered
 water
 mixer
 (SWM)
 to
control
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
 by
 investigating
 ﬂow
 dynamics,
 the
thermal
 structure
 of
 the
 water
 column,
 and
 phytoplankton
 photo-
physiology.

 Materials
 and
 methods
2.1.
 Study
 site
Fieldwork
 was
 undertaken
 at
 Falling
 Creek
 Reservoir,
 which
 is
located
 northeast
 of
 Roanoke
 (37◦18′12′′ N
 and
 79◦50′15′′ W),
 in
Bedford
 county,
 Virginia
 in
 the
 United
 States
 at
 an
 elevation
 of
509
 m.
 The
 reservoir
 holds
 322,000
 m3 of
 water
 at
 full
 capacity,
 and
has
 a
 surface
 area
 of
 8.5
 ha
 and
 maximum
 depth
 of
 10
 m
 (Fig.
 1).
Managed
 by
 the
 Western
 Virginia
 Water
 Authority
 (WVWA),
 it
receives
 water
 from
 Beaver
 reservoir
 and
 supplies
 water
 to
 a
conventional
 alum
 coagulation-ﬁltration
 plant
 with
 chlorine
 dis-
infection.
 At
 full
 scale
 operation,
 the
 treatment
 facility
 produces
3800
 m3 of
 water
 per
 day
 for
 distribution
 for
 potable
 use.
 The
reservoir
 experiences
 thermal
 stratiﬁcation
 throughout
 much
 of
the
 summer,
 with
 temperature
 difference
 between
 surface
 and
bottom
 exceeding
 7 ◦C
 on
 occasions.
 In
 the
 summers
 of
 2004
 and
2008,
 the
 thermal
 stratiﬁcation
 persisted
 for
 the
 longest
 period
of
 time.
 Cyanobacteria
 often
 make
 up
 a
 signiﬁcant
 proportion
 of
cells
 in
 the
 phytoplankton
 community
 in
 the
 reservoir.
 Although
typically
 dominated
 by
 Anacystis
 nidulans,
 Anabaena
 circinalis
 was
more
 dominant
 in
 2004
 with
 a
 recorded
 cell
 concentration
 of
4000
 cells
 mL−1. In
 May
 2007,
 WVWA
 installed
 a
 surface
 mounted

SWM
 device
 called
 SolarBee
 (model
 number
 SB10000v12)
 in
 the
reservoir
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 control
 cyanobacteria
 and
 associated
water
 quality
 problems.
2.2.
 The
 SWM
 apparatus
The
 SWM
 is
 an
 up-ﬂow
 water
 circulator
 that
 pumps
 water
 to
the
 surface
 through
 an
 intake
 hose,
 and
 transports
 it
 away
 radially
in
 all
 directions
 (Fig.
 1),
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 improve
 surface
 ﬂows
and
 disrupt
 quiescent
 surface
 water
 conditions.
 The
 manufacturer’s
rating
 of
 the
 SWM
 device
 used
 in
 this
 study
 is
 11.4
 m3 min−1 of
direct
 ﬂow
 through
 the
 intake
 hose,
 and
 26.5
 m3 min−1 of
 induced
ﬂow
 outside
 the
 intake
 hose,
 for
 a
 combined
 ﬂow
 of
 37.9
 m3 min−1.
During
 the
 ﬁeld
 campaign
 from
 26
 July
 to
 21
 August
 2008,
 the
 SWM
was
 placed
 halfway
 along
 the
 reservoir’s
 north-south
 elongation
 at
a
 location
 approximately
 4
 m
 deep,
 with
 the
 intake
 hose
 at
 a
 depth
of
 1.2
 m.
 The
 SWM
 was
 switched
 on
 at
 13:00
 p.m.
 on
 28
 July
 and
switched
 off
 at
 09:41
 a.m.
 on
 13
 August,
 and
 was
 operated
 24
 h
 a
day.
2.3.
 Water
 velocity
 proﬁle
 measurement
A
 Workhorse
 Rio
 Grande
 1200
 kHz
 Acoustic
 Doppler
 Current
Proﬁler
 (ADCP)
 manufactured
 by
 Teledyne
 RD
 Instruments,
 Inc.
 was
used
 to
 collect
 velocity
 proﬁles
 before
 and
 during
 operation
 of
 the
SWM.
 The
 ADCP
 was
 deployed
 on
 a
 trimaran
 and
 towed
 next
 to
 the
boat
 from
 which
 the
 proﬁles
 were
 taken
 at
 an
 interval
 of
 1
 m,
 up
to
 a
 distance
 of
 8
 m
 with
 a
 cell
 size
 of
 25
 cm.
 The
 velocity
 accuracy
of
 this
 unit
 is
 ±0.25%
 of
 the
 water
 and
 boat
 velocity,
 and
 nominally
0.002
 m
 s−1.
 During
 this
 study,
 the
 boat
 remained
 stationary
 while
the
 velocity
 proﬁles
 were
 measured
 and
 hence
 the
 boat
 velocity
was
 effectively
 zero.
2.4.
 Depth-temperature
 proﬁle
 measurement
Depth-temperature
 proﬁles
 were
 measured
 using
 a
 Sea-Bird
Electronics
 SBE-19plus
 SEACAT
 conductivity-temperature-depth
(CTD)
 Proﬁler.
 This
 unit
 samples
 continuously
 at
 4
 Hz.
 Proﬁles
 were
collected
 at
 distances
 of
 1,
 2,
 3,
 5,
 10,
 20,
 50,
 100,
 150,
 and
 200
 m
from
 the
 SWM
 (Fig.
 1).
 To
 get
 the
 baseline
 of
 pre-existing
 temper-
ature
 distribution
 in
 the
 reservoir,
 morning
 and
 afternoon
 proﬁles
were
 collected
 for
 two
 days
 before
 switching
 on
 the
 SWM.
 After

S.
 Upadhyay
 et

 / Ecological
 Engineering

247
the
 SWM
 was
 switched
 on,
 proﬁles
 were
 recollected
 for
 the
 next
two
 days,
 and
 weekly
 thereafter
 for
 the
 next
 two
 weeks.
2.5.
 Analysis
 of
 vertical
 structure
 of
 water
 column
The
 vertical
 structure
 of
 the
 water
 column
 in
 the
 reservoir
during
 operation
 of
 SWM
 was
 characterized
 using
 temperature
proﬁles,
 temperature
 gradients
 between
 the
 surface
 and
 bottom
layers
 of
 the
 water
 column
 (T),
 coefﬁcient
 of
 variation
 of
 tem-
peratures
 throughout
 the
 water
 column
 (C.V.)
 –
 calculated
 as
the
 standard
 deviation
 of
 the
 temperature
 proﬁle
 over
 the
 water
column
 divided
 by
 its
 mean,
 and
 downward
 cumulative
 relative
thermal
 resistance
 to
 mixing
 (cRTRM)
 Relative
 thermal
 resistance
to
 mixing
 (RTRM),
 a
 dimensionless
 index
 that
 quantiﬁes
 the
 inten-
sity
 of
 density
 differences
 due
 to
 the
 temperatures
 of
 adjacent
water
 strata,
 signiﬁes
 the
 intensity
 of
 thermal
 stratiﬁcation,
 and
was
 calculated
 following
 Wetzel
 (2001):
RTRM
 = z2 −
 z1
4 −
 5
(1)
where
 z2 and
 z1 are
 densities
 of
 water
 at
 depth
 of
 4
 m
 (z2) and
at
 the
 surface
 (z1)
 respectively
 (kg
 m−3),
 and
 4 and
 5 are
 water
densities
 at
 4
 and
 5 ◦C
 respectively
 (kg
 m−3).
 Water
 densities
 at
 cor-
responding
 depths
 were
 calculated
 following
 Henderson-Sellers
(1984):
t =
 999.9726(1
 −
 9.297173
 ×
 10−6|t
 −
 277.029325|1.894816)
 
(2)
where
 t is
 water
 density
 (kg
 m−3)
 at
 temperature
 t
 (◦C).
 Lower
 val-
ues
 of
 all
 three
 measures
 indicate
 an
 increased
 mixing,
 and
 thus,
 a
more
 homogeneous
 vertical
 structure
 of
 the
 water
 column.
 Results
were
 evaluated
 before
 and
 during
 operation
 of
 the
 SWM.
2.6.
 Fluorescence
 yield
 measurement
 and
 ﬂuorescence
 ratio
The
 ﬂuorescence
 ratio
 was
 used
 as
 an
 indicator
 of
 previous
 light
history
 and
 mixing
 of
 cyanobacteria.
 Water
 samples
 were
 collected
from
 the
 surface
 and
 at
 depths
 of
 0.3
 m,
 1
 m,
 2
 m
 and
 4
 m,
 up
 to
 a
lateral
 distance
 of
 150
 m
 from
 the
 SWM.
 These
 depths
 correspond
to
 100%,
 70%,
 50%,
 30%
 and
 1%
 of
 surface
 irradiance
 for
 an
 attenu-
ation
 coefﬁcient
 (kd)
 of
 1.15
 m−1, i.e.
 the
 regression
 coefﬁcient
 for
the
 natural
 log
 of
 euphotic
 depth
 of
 4
 m.
 Cyanobacterial
 cells
 in
water
 samples
 were
 dark-adapted
 in
 cuvettes
 for
 15
 min,
 and
 ﬂuo-
rescence
 yield
 was
 measured
 in
 an
 adjacent
 laboratory
 using
 a
 Pulse
Amplitude
 Modulated
 (PAM)
 Fluorometer
 (Phyto-PAM,
 Heinz
 Walz
GmBH,
 Effeltrich,
 Germany;
 see
 Schrieber
 et
 al.,
 1994).
 The
 ﬂuo-
rescence
 yield
 of
 the
 dark-adapted
 cells,
 Fo,
 was
 determined
 by
stimulation
 with
 a
 weak
 probe
 light
 immediately
 following
 15
 min
of
 darkness.
 The
 maximum
 ﬂuorescence
 yield,
 Fm,
 was
 determined
following
 the
 closure
 of
 all
 reaction
 centers
 by
 a
 600
 ms  pulse
 of
saturating
 irradiance.
 Variable
 ﬂuorescence,
 Fv,
 was
 determined
 as
the
 numerical
 difference
 between
 Fm
 and
 Fo,
 i.e.
 Fv
 =
 Fm
 −
 Fo,
 and
the
 variable
 ﬂuorescence
 ratio
 was
 calculated
 as
 Fv/Fm.

 Results
3.1.
 Flow
 dynamics
The
 three-dimensional
 velocity
 ﬂow
 ﬁeld
 was
 measured
 in
 a
radial
 transect
 away
 from
 the
 SWM.
 No
 obvious
 structure
 was
 evi-
dent
 in
 the
 near
 ﬁeld
 velocity
 proﬁles
 before
 operating
 the
 device,
and
 the
 recorded
 velocities
 were
 very
 low,
 typical
 of
 calm
 and
quiescent
 conditions.
 After
 the
 SWM
 was
 switched
 on,
 water
 was
drawn
 radially
 toward
 it
 and
 weak
 velocity
 ﬁelds
 were
 detected
within
 a
 lateral
 distance
 of
 5
 m,
 to
 a
 depth
 of
 1.5
 m
 from
 the
 sur-
face
 (Fig.
 2).
 Outside
 this
 zone,
 there
 was
 no

 Based
 on
 a
 mean
 bulk
ﬂow

 of
 0.03
 m
 s−1 toward
 the
 SWM
 over
 a
 depth
 of
 1.5
 m
 and
a
 radius
 of
 1
 m,
 the
 total
 direct
 ﬂow
 generated
 by
 the
 SWM
 that
entered
 through
 its
 intake
 hose
 was
 0.28
 m3 s−1.
3.2.
 Vertical
 thermal
 structure
 of
 the
 water
 column
Water
 temperatures
 were
 typically
 warm
 in
 Falling
 Creek
Reservoir,
 exceeding
 25 ◦C,
 and
 thermal
 stratiﬁcation
 was
 evident
throughout
 the
 reservoir
 at
 the
 start
 of
 the
 experiment.
 On
 the
morning
 of
 27
 July,
 stratiﬁcation
 was
 relatively
 weak
 but
 by
 after-
noon
 a
 temperature
 difference
 of
 more
 than
 2 ◦C
 was
 established
throughout
 the
 reservoir
 over
 the
 4
 m
 water
 column,
 and
 surface
mixed
 layer
 was
 1
 m
 thick
 or
 less
 (Fig.
 3).
 After
 switching
 on
 the
SWM  at
 13:00
 p.m.
 on
 28
 July,
 surface
 waters
 cooled
 and
 the
 surface
mixed
 layer
 deepened
 to
 approximately
 2
 m
 immediately
 adjacent
to
 the
 SWM
 up
 to
 a
 distance
 of
 3
 m,
 while
 little
 change
 occurred
beyond
 this
 distance
 (Fig.
 3).
On
 29
 July,
 a
 day
 after
 switching
 on
 the
 SWM,
 stratiﬁcation
intensiﬁed
 during
 the
 afternoon,
 and
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 SWM
decreased
 to
 a
 distance
 of
 less
 than
 3
 m
 (Fig.
 3).
 Even
 during
 the
weaker
 stratiﬁcation
 conditions
 in
 the
 morning
 after
 almost
 two
days
 of
 operating
 the
 SWM,
 surface
 water
 temperature
 was
 below
27 ◦C
 only
 up
 to
 a
 distance
 of
 5
 m
 from
 the
 SWM
 while
 at
 distances
of
 10
 m
 and
 greater,
 it
 exceeded
 27 ◦C
 (Fig.
 3).
 In
 the
 deeper
 water
layers,
 however,
 the
 impact
 was
 less
 noticeable,
 and
 water
 temper-
atures
 were
 comparable
 throughout
 the
 reservoir.
 The
 decrease
 in
T
 and
 deepening
 of
 the
 surface
 mixed
 layer
 in
 the
 water
 column
closer
 to
 the
 SWM
 is
 because
 of
 the
 marginal
 cooling
 of
 surface
water
 temperature,
 not
 because
 of
 deeper
 vertical
 mixing.
Calculated
 values
 of
 cRTRM
 and
 C.V.
 over
 the
 top
 4
 m
 of
 the
water
 column
 across
 the
 reservoir
 further
 conﬁrm
 the
 localized
impact
 of
 the
 SWM.
 Immediately
 after
 switching
 on
 the
 SWM,
cRTRM
 values
 ranged
 around
 30
 up
 to
 a
 distance
 of
 3
 m
 to
 around
100
 at
 distances
 of
 more
 than
 3
 m
 (Table
 1).
 Although
 this
 difference
was
 smaller
 in
 the
 mornings
 when
 the
 stratiﬁcation
 was
 weaker,
the
 contrasting
 afternoon-morning
 pattern
 was
 observed
 consis-
tently.
 The
 C.V.
 was
 comparable
 throughout
 the
 reservoir
 before
switching
 on
 the
 SWM
 but
 decreased
 up
 to
 a
 distance
 of
 3 m
 dur-
ing
 stronger
 stratiﬁcation
 conditions
 in
 the
 afternoon
 during
 its
operation
 (Table
 1).
Even
 after
 more
 than
 10
 days
 of
 continuous
 operation,
 thermal
stratiﬁcation
 continued
 to
 persist
 near
 the
 SWM,
 although
 some-
what
 weaker
 than
 at
 distant
 sites.
 After
 11
 days
 of
 its
 operation,
near-complete
 mixing
 of
 the
 reservoir
 was
 observed
 on
 7
 August
but
 this
 loss
 of
 stratiﬁcation
 coincided
 with
 a
 decrease
 in
 min-
imum
 air
 temperature
 by
 more
 than
 5 ◦C,
 recorded
 in
 a
 nearby
Roanoke
 Airport.
 Once
 the
 air
 temperature
 started
 to
 increase
 again
on
 12
 August,
 stratiﬁcation
 was
 again
 established
 throughout
 the
reservoir.
 Despite
 lack
 of
 adequate
 data
 to
 evaluate
 the
 correlation
between
 atmospheric
 cooling
 and
 the
 loss
 of
 reservoir
 stratiﬁca-
tion,
 the
 time
 lag
 of
 more
 than
 a
 week
 for
 the
 loss
 of
 stratiﬁcation

 Phytoplankton
 photo-physiology
The
 hypothesis
 for
 the
 use
 of
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 devices
 for
cyanobacterial
 control
 is
 that
 they
 increase
 the
 depth
 of
 mixing
and
 light-limit
 the
 growth
 of
 phytoplankton.
 The
 PAM-ﬂuorometer
sampling
 conducted
 a
 day
 before
 operating
 the
 SWM,
 on
 27
 July
 at
13:00
 p.m.
 and
 15:00
 p.m.,
 showed
 increasing
 depression
 in
 vari-
able
 ﬂuorescence
 ratio,
 Fv/Fm,
 with
 increasing
 stratiﬁcation
 and
light
 exposure.
 At
 the
 location
 of
 SWM,
 Fv/Fm
 was
 around
 0.3
 at
 the
surface
 and
 more
 than
 0.5
 at
 a
 depth
 of
 2
 m,
 and
 the
 ratio
 was
 sim-
ilar
 at
 other
 sampling
 sites
 (Fig.
 4a
 and
 b).
 On
 28
 July
 at
 09:30
 a.m.,
a
 few
 hours
 before
 operating
 the
 SWM,
 weaker
 gradient
 in
 Fv/Fm
was
 observed
 between
 surface
 and
 bottom
 water
 layers
 because
of
 low
 light
 exposure
 at
 the
 surface.
 However,
 immediately
 before
switching
 on
 the
 SWM
 at
 13:00
 p.m.,
 Fv/Fm
 was
 more
 depressed
 at
the
 surface
 and
 stronger
 gradient
 in
 Fv/Fm
 was
 observed,
 with
 val-
ues
 ranging
 from
 0.37
 at
 the
 surface
 to
 0.52
 at
 2
 m
 depth.
 The
 surface
depression
 in
 Fv/Fm
 eroded
 adjacent
 to
 the
 SWM
 after

 Discussion
4.1.
 Artiﬁcial
 mixing
 for
 controlling
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
Several
 forms
 of
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 devices
 have
 been
 tested
 and
evaluated
 in
 ﬁeld
 conditions
 for
 controlling
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
with
 limited
 success
 (McAuliffe
 and
 Rosich,
 1990;
 Visser
 et
 al.,
1996;
 Sherman
 et
 al.,
 2000;
 Lewis
 et
 al.,
 2010),
 in
 part
 because
of
 the
 complex
 interaction
 of
 the
 extent
 of
 mixing
 and
 destrati-
ﬁcation
 upon
 the
 availability
 of
 nutrients
 and
 light,
 which
 are
 both
required
 for
 cyanobacterial
 growth.

growth
 by
 using
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 devices
 is
 practically
 achieved
 by
entraining
 phytoplankton
 below
 a
 depth
 where
 photosynthesis
 is
light-limited.
 This
 theoretical
 basis
 for
 such
 control
 is
 dependent
upon
 the
 relationship
 between
 the
 depth
 of
 the
 surface
 mixed
 layer
and
 the
 euphotic
 depth,
 i.e.
 the
 depth
 of
 water
 column
 up
 to
 which
there
 is
 a
 penetration
 of
 light
 or
 photosynthetically
 active
 radiation
(PAR,
 400–700
 nm).
While
 traditional
 methods
 of
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 such
 as
 bub-
ble
 plume
 aerators
 primarily
 focus
 on
 enhancing
 vertical
 mixing
for
 deepening
 the
 surface
 mixed
 layer,
 surface
 mounted
 mixing
devices
 such
 as
 the
 one
 used
 in
 this
 study
 are
 designed
 to
 pump
waters
 from
 deeper
 layers
 to
 the
 surface
 and
 transport
 it
 radially
away
 from
 the
 device.
 This
 action
 targets
 stratiﬁcation
 at
 shallower
depths
 by
 increasing
 epilimnetic
 circulation
 in
 order
 to
 break
 quies-
cent
 water
 conditions.
 Consequently,
 it
 follows
 that
 the
 strength
 of
mixing
 and
 the
 depth
 of
 the
 surface
 mixed
 layer
 would
 be
 greater
adjacent
 to
 these
 devices,
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 buoyant
 cells
 near
 the
immediate
 zone
 of
 inﬂuence
 would
 be
 maintained
 in
 deep
 water
intrusion
 in
 comparison
 to
 regions
 outside
 the
 zone
 of
 inﬂuence.
Visser
 et
 al.
 (1996)
 found
 that
 on
 a
 sunny
 and
 calm
 day,
 the
 buoy-
ancy
 of
 cyanobacterial
 colonies
 was
 low
 close
 to
 the
 bubble
 plumes,
where
 cells
 circulated
 through
 a
 greater
 depth
 and
 experienced
 a
low
 mean
 light
 dose,
 but
 buoyancy
 was
 higher
 at
 some
 distance
from
 these
 plumes
 where
 mixing
 was
 less
 intense.
 This
 suggests
that
 the
 cyanobacterial
 cells
 escape
 the
 mixing
 at
 some
 distance
from
 the
 plumes
 and
 synthesize
 more
 carbohydrates
 during
 their
stay
 in
 the
 upper
 illuminated
 layer
 of
 water
 bodies
 compared
 to
near
 the
 mixing
 devices
 where
 mixing
 is
 more
 intense.
4.2.
 Flows
 generated
 by
 the
 SWM
During
 this
 study,
 SWM
 generated
 fairly
 low
 ﬂows
 compared
to
 traditional
 mixing
 devices.
 For
 example,
 Sherman
 et
 al.
 (2000)
measured
 an
 intrusion
 from
 a
 bubble
 plume
 aerator
 that
 was
 5
 m
thick
 and
 had
 a
 peak
 velocity
 of
 0.8
 m
 s−1 while
 Lewis
 (2004)
measured
 ﬂows
 exceeding
 3.5
 m3 s−1, using
 an
 energy-intensive
surface
 mounted
 mechanical
 mixer.
 Visser
 et
 al.
 (1996)
 reported
successful
 prevention
 of
 summer
 stratiﬁcation
 in
 a
 larger
 lake
 with
a
 mean
 depth
 of
 15
 m
 with
 the
 use
 of
 powerful
 air
 compressors
 to
induce
 mixing,
 and
 Lewis
 et
 al.
 (2005)
 suggested
 that
 limiting
 the
concentrations
 of
 the
 buoyant
 cyanobacterial
 cells
 to
 a
 maximum
of
 ∼1000
 cells
 mL−1 required
 a
 high
 ﬂow
 rate
 of
 up
 to
 8
 m3 s−1 in
some
 instances.
In contrast,
 the
 mixing
 capacity
 of
 SWM
 during
 this
 study
 was
signiﬁcantly
 lower,
 only
 0.28
 m3 s−1, and
 the
 device
 was
 ineffec-
tive
 in
 completely
 mixing
 the
 4
 m
 deep
 water
 column.
 The
 SWM
was
 simply
 underpowered
 in
 comparison
 to
 other
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
devices,
 as
 there
 was
 no
 evidence
 of
 complete
 mixing
 that
 could
 be
solely
 attributed
 to
 its
 operation.
 When
 such
 devices
 are
 not
 able
 to
prevent
 surface
 layer
 heating
 and
 development
 of
 a
 stratiﬁed
 sur-
face
 layer,
 the
 prevailing
 aquatic
 habitat
 could
 be
 easily
 exploited
by
 the
 buoyant
 cyanobacteria
 to
 grow
 and
 multiply
 rapidly
 (Visser
et
 al.,
 1996).
 The
 limited
 zone
 of
 overall
 inﬂuence,
 restricted
 to
 5
 m
lateral
 distance
 of
 SWM,
 and
 continued
 existence
 of
 thermal
 strati-
ﬁcation
 while
 it
 was
 in
 operation
 in
 Falling
 Creek
 Reservoir
 suggests
that
 the
 extent
 of
 induced
 mixing
 by
 SWM
 is
 insufﬁcient
 to
 control
cyanobacterial
 blooms.
4.3.
 Inference
 from
 phytoplankton
 photo-physiology
One
 of
 the
 key
 theoretical
 correlations
 that
 can
 be
 attributed
 to
control
 of
 cyanobacterial
 growth
 by
 artiﬁcial
 mixing
 devices
 is
 the
resulting
 increase
 in
 the
 depth
 of
 the
 surface
 mixed
 layer
 with
 their
use.
 Because
 Fv/Fm
 is
 sensitive
 to
 photon
 ﬂux
 density,
 it
 shows
promise
 as
 a
 parameter
 to
 offer
 insight
 into
 the
 immediate
 past
light-history
 of
 phytoplankton
 as
 it
 can
 yield
 information
 on
 water
column
 mixing,
 and
 entrainment
 and
 vertical
 migration
 of
 buoyant
cyanobacterial
 cells
 (Brookes
 et
 al.,
 2003;
 Regel
 et
 al.,
 2004).
 Dur-
ing
 this
 study,
 baseline
 observation
 of
 the
 cell
 photo-physiology
with
 PAM
 ﬂuorometry
 conducted
 before
 operating
 the
 SWM
 con-
ﬁrmed
 that
 Fv/Fm
 is
 sensitive
 to
 light
 and
 was
 appropriate
 as
 an
indicator
 of
 the
 induced
 mixing.
 This
 is
 because
 the
 gradient
 of
 the
ratio
 between
 surface
 and
 bottom
 layers
 of
 the
 reservoir
 appeared
progressively
 stronger
 with
 continued
 exposure
 to
 light
 during
 the
day.
 After
 operating
 the
 SWM,
 decrease
 in
 Fv/Fm
 gradient
 between
surface
 and
 bottom
 water
 layers
 was
 clearly
 evident
 up
 to
 a
 dis-
tance
 of
 5
 m
 from
 the
 SWM,
 and
 this
 observation
 further
 supports
the
 observed
 limited
 zone
 of
 inﬂuence
 measured
 with
 the
 ADCP
 and
analyzed
 through
 changes
 that
 occurred
 in
 the
 thermal
 structure
of
 the
 water
 column.
One
 more
 plausible
 explanation
 can
 support
 the
 limitation
 of
the
 SWM
 in
 inducing
 adequate
 mixing
 to
 light-limit
 the
 growth
of
 cyanobacteria
 in
 large
 reservoirs.
 Many
 authors
 have
 used
 the
ratio
 between
 the
 depth
 of
 surface
 mixed
 layer
 and
 the
 euphotic
depth
 as
 an
 indicator
 to
 evaluate
 the
 potential
 for
 light
 limiting
phytoplankton
 growth,
 and
 ratios
 of
 2.5
 or
 3
 are
 considered
 optimal
for
 controlling
 cyanobacterial
 blooms
 (Sherman
 et
 al.,
 2000;
 Heo
and
 Kim,
 2004),
 implying
 that
 the
 surface
 layer
 must
 be
 mixed
 to
 a
depth
 greater
 than
 the
 depth
 to
 which
 light
 penetrates.
 Based
 on
 1%
of
 surface
 irradiance,
 Falling
 Creek
 Reservoir
 has
 a
 euphotic
 depth
of
 4
 m,
 but
 during
 this
 study,
 the
 depth
 of
 surface
 mixed
 layer
 at
 any
given
 location
 was
 always
 less
 than
 2.8
 m,
 meaning
 the
 ratio
 is
 less
than
 1.
 To
 light-limit
 the
 cyanobacterial
 growth,
 the
 SWM
 needed
to
 completely
 mix
 the
 4
 m
 deep
 water
 column
 in
 the
 Falling
 Creek
Reservoir
 but
 no
 such
 evidence
 was
 observed
 during
 this
 study.
5.
 Conclusion
The
 potential
 of
 the
 surface-mounted
 SWM
 for
 controlling
the
 blooms
 was
 evaluated
 by
 determining
 whether
 it
 effectively
mixed
 the
 water
 column
 to
 weaken
 thermal
 stratiﬁcation
 and

deepen
 surface
 mixed
 layer
 to
 an
 extent
 that
 could
 entrain
 surface
cyanobacteria
 to
 light-limit
 their
 growth
 in
 Falling
 Creek
 Reservoir.
We
 determined
 that
 the
 impact
 of
 SWM
 was
 highly
 localized,
 and
therefore,
 a
 single
 SWM
 unit,
 at
 its
 current
 form,
 has
 insufﬁcient
mixing
 capacity
 to
 control
 cyanobacterial
 growth
 in
 larger
 lakes
and
 reservoirs.
 We
 recommend
 future
 work
 to
 improve
 design
 and
power
 of
 solar
 energy
 operated
 devices
 in
 order
 to
 improve
 their
performance
 for
 effectively
 controlling
 cyanobacterial
 blooms.
