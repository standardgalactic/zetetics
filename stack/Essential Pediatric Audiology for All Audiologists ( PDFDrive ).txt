Course Description
• Facing the challenges of a child in the audiometric 
test suite can be daunting at times.
• This presentation is designed to assist you in making 
the most of the test time. Tips and strategies and 
evidence based practice will be presented.

Topics Covered
• Evidence Based
– Physiologic Methods
– Behavioral Methods
• Clinical Tips to Maximize Information
– Physiologic Methods
– Behavioral Methods

Objectives
• This is a session about how to maximize doing 
physiologic and behavioral testing in young children.
• This is a session that uses research to aid in best practice

Participants will be able to:
• Design an optimal infant test battery. 
• Develop an action plan for obtaining a complete 
audiometric profile with infants/toddlers. 
• Integrate family-friendly practices into the 
audiological management of children.

I’m an “adult” audiologist.  Why do I 
need to worry about providing services 
for children?

Need for Pediatric Audiologists
• 2,000,000 live births in US each year
• 95% hospital screen = 1,900,000
• 4% refer rate = 76,000 will need to be tested by an 
audiologist
This does not include the 
– Other referrals,
– Later onset of hearing loss, and
– Audiological management of the 
children already identified with 
hearing loss

They need you!

Ok, you got my attention.  Tell me what 
I need to work with this population.

• An audiologist must…
– Utilize age-appropriate testing techniques (ear-specific, 
frequency specific, child specific, state-of-the-art)
– Be able to run test equipment with their eyes in the back 
of their head
– Have very quick hands and anticipate the child’s moves
– Be flexible, creative, compassionate
– Know how to work with multiple disciplines, 
personalities, cultures, family dynamics
– Family-friendly scheduling 
– Patience and a friendly smile
Must haves – things that don’t cost

Must haves – things to budget for
• A sound room/booth large enough for strollers, baby 
bags, high chairs, pediatric chairs and tables, 
standard chairs, and of course test equipment and 
materials
• A variety of toys, books, flashlights – all things that 
can easily be cleaned
• Lots of bubbles
• Portable and diagnostic audiometers with insert 
earphones, Immittance system, OAEs, otoscope, 
and ABR )

An ABR costs a lot of money.  Why do I 
need it?  What do I do with it? 

Testing Children
• Auditory Brainstem 
Response (ABR)

Auditory Brainstem Response
• The underlying assumption is that a temporal 
relationship exists between the sensory stimulation 
and the resulting neural response.

Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) 
Protocol
• Air Conduction
– Click 
– Tone Bursts at 500 Hz, 10000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 40000 Hz
• Bone Conduction

Limitations of Click Response
• Need good neural synchrony
• Not frequency specific
– Miss losses not centered at 2-4k  Hz e.g. low and high 
frequency configurations and potentially mid frequency 
losses if 4k and above have normal thresholds

Normal Condensation/Rarefaction Click

ABR-Frequency Specificity
• Click ABRs can miss hearing losses especially if only 
presence or absence of wave V is used as a criteria 
• Stapells and Oates, 1997 showed high, mid and low 
frequency losses missed by click ABR as wave V still 
present at ‘normal’ levels. 

NR to Click ABR

Comparison of ABR and Behavioral Thresholds
(verify, verify, verify!)

How to obtain a frequency specific audiogram 
using electrophysiological measures?
• Tonal stimuli
– problem is the shorter the duration of onset, the less tonal 
but the better ability to elicit a response (abrupt onset 
there is more spectral spatter--energy in unwanted 
frequencies)

ABR-Frequency Specificity
• Tonal ABR and behavioral thresholds
– Correlation exists ( Hayes & Jerger, 1983; Kodera, et al., 
1977; Moller & Blegvad, 1976; Sininger et al., 1997; Stapells 
et al, 1995)
– Thresholds estimated to within 20 dB on average with 
better response agreement between behavioral and ABR 
tonal thresholds in Ss with SNHL

ABR-Frequency Specificity
• Stimulus
– Gating function: frequency specificity vs. place specific.  
Some studies show little difference with different (linear 
vs. Blackman) gating functions (Oates and Stapells, 1997; 
Purdy and Abbas, 2002) although in theory, should be 
better (Gorga & Thornton, 1989)

ABR-Frequency Specificity
• Stimulus
– Polarity:  alternating may eliminate stimulus artifact
– Calibration: lack of standards for ABR, different for pure 
tone stimuli 
– Repetition rate: studies?  Time is important

ABR-Frequency Specificity
• Filter settings: infants have low frequency energy in 
their ABR (Suzuki et al., 1977; Picton et al., 1981; 
Hyde, 1985)

ABR-Frequency Specificity
• Conclusion:  substantial literature in most areas to 
support the use of frequency specific stimuli using 
the ABR as a way to predict the audiogram 

Stapells, DR 
Threshold estimation by the tone-evoked auditory 
brainstem response: a literature meta-analysis. 
J Speech Lang Pathol Audiol 2000 24(2),74-83.

Stapells, 2000
• In this review and meta-analysis of 32 studies, the tone-
evoked ABR was evaluated for it’s ability to accurately 
predicted behavioral thresholds in normally hearing and 
hearing-impaired infants, young children and adults.
•
Results revealed acceptably low behavioral thresholds 
estimation in normally hearing, and reasonably accurate 
threshold estimation in hearing-impaired subjects including 
500 Hz, which had been open to speculation about accuracy

What information do Audiologists need to accurately 
estimate an audiogram with ABR in infants? 
• Appropriate stimulus and recording parameters for 
infant ABR
• Appropriate interpretation of results based on test 
battery
• Accuracy of threshold prediction when using click 
and tone-burst ABR

Protocol for Infant ABR
• Sedation  ?? 
• Filter settings at 30-1000 (no higher than 100)
• Rate <30 stim/second
• Recording window of 15-25 ms
• Low Electrode Impedance
– Below 3K Ohms and balanced
• AC - Click (AN), TB (.5, 2, 4, 1K) 
• BC - TB (.5, 2k)

Tips for Infant ABR
• Repeat 
• Increase # of sweeps at threshold Averaging
“MAGIC” # of Sweeps
• Bracket large (20-40dB), then small
• Verify, verify, verify

Tips
• Prep the child before asleep, while eating if doing 
unsedated/natural sleep ABR
• Work fast—prioritizing which frequencies you need 
first and fill in gaps as time allows
• Repeat responses for those unclear and close to 
threshold
• No need to do high levels at all frequencies 

Tips for Infant ABR
• Sleeping baby
– Test at nap time
– Don’t sleep in the car
– Sedate over 3 months
• Comfortable Baby
– Dry, swaddled

Take Home Message
• A Click ABR alone is NOT enough
• You can and should obtain TB ABR
• TB ABRs will have different morphology and latency 
than click ABRs, especially at 500Hz
• Waveform recognition is a pattern recognition task 
and requires PRACTICE!
• Verify, Verify, Verify

How do I estimate the audiogram?

Auditory Brainstem Response
• Ability to predict the type and degree of loss as well 
as the audiogram’s contour
– click, to within 5 dB of behavioral threshold
– Tone burst correction factors for normal hearing 
individuals
• 500 Hz 20 dB
• 1000 Hz 15 dB
• 2000 Hz  10 dB
• 4000 Hz 10 dB

Is air conduction sufficient?

Control at -5dB
Born at 33 weeks, tested at 8 days
Bilateral microtia and atresia; Treacher Collins

TJ 3 months
Hx: Atresia

Bone conduction ABR
• stimulus spectrum is different
– due to different transducers
• dynamic range is different
– b/c rarely exceeds 45-55 dB maximum stimulus level
• relationship between output of the oscillator and the 
“dial reading” will differ between instruments

Bone conduction ABR
• First obtain unmasked threshold
• If ears are asymmetric then masking will be needed
• Response will resemble air conduction ABR and can 
be obtained at levels very close to behavioral 
thresholds

Bone conduction
Unmasked
masked

Bone conduction ABR
• if click and tone burst ABRs are normal do not need 
to do bone conduction ABR
• parameters are the same as for air-conduction clicks 
except -- use alternating polarity
– will eliminate electrical artifact from the bone oscillator

Behavioral thresholds and ABR thresholds 
have very good agreement.

Limitations of ABR
• Not a test of hearing

Auditory Steady State Response

Auditory Steady State Response 
• Variable findings
• Some suggestion that there is better threshold 
estimation in individuals with hearing loss
• May provide more information for severe-to-
profound group 
• Some studies say just as good as tonal-ABR results, 
others say better, yet other say not as good

Tlumak AI, Rubinstein E, Durrant JD.
Meta-analysis of variables that affect accuracy of 
threshold estimation via measurement of the 
auditory steady-state response (ASSR) 
International Journal of Audiology Nov 2007: 692 - 710 

Tlumak et al., 2007
Conclusions
• 80-Hz ASSR is a reasonably reliable method for estimating 
hearing sensitivity in the mid-to-high frequencies in those 
with and without hearing loss
• more accurate threshold estimations using 80-Hz ASSR are 
obtained as carrier frequency increases in those with hearing 
loss 
• electrode position is not related to mean threshold 
differences at any carrier frequency in either those with or 
without hearing loss 
• assuming validity of comparisons across studies using 80 vs. 
40 Hz threshold estimates …improved accuracy of threshold 
estimation using 40 Hz when testing at lower carrier 
frequencies (e.g. 0.5 kHz).

Tlumak et al., 2007
Conclusion cont.
• more accurate threshold estimates via 80-Hz ASSR might be 
obtained with the use of AM tones than MM tones in the 
hearing-impaired population
• there appear to be practical limits of the number of sweeps in 
signal averaging of the 80-Hz ASSR (at least in the hearing-
impaired population)
• there are differences between 80-Hz ASSR mean threshold 
differences found between stimulus conditions monaural and 
binaural multiple frequency (at least in the hearing-
impaired population). 

I have an immittance system.  Do I need 
OAEs?

• Immittance equipment
– Must have…
• Tympanometry at multiple frequencies
• Acoustic Reflexes (Ipsilateral and Contralateral)
• Why?
Not all Immittance Systems are created equal…

• 1000 Hz tone should be used instead of 226 Hz tone
– Why?
• Ear Canal/Middle Ear Characteristics
– mass and resistive components more prominent 
• Ear canal volume too small
• Shape of ear canal is slit like
• Ambient room noise – may read as occluded
• False readings with 226 Hz tone
Babies

High Frequency Tympanometry
– 76 infants (151 ears) presenting for out-patient screen/re-
screen at ACH
– Adjusted ages:  37.5 wks - 6 months, 28 days
– HFTs compared with pneumatic otoscopy yielded an 
observed agreement of 87.5%, Kappa = 0.72 (p<0.0001)
– Results: HFTs in good agreement with both pneumatic 
otoscopy and OAEs.

Acoustic Immittance
• Standard 226 Hz tympanometry in Infants
– Tympanometric patterns are not the same in newborns 
compared to older infants/children  
– Not effective for determining fluid i.e.  ‘normal’ appearing 
results can be found when surgically confirmed fluid found
– Ear canal movement suspected (Paradise et al., 1976) and 
determined (Keefe et al., 1993)  but not sole contributor to 
tympanometric findings (Holte et al., 1990)

• 2 month old referred for diagnostic ABR
• 15 dB difference between a/c and b/c click stimuli
• Mild-to-moderate CHL 
Case Study 

• 3 mo referred for diagnostic ABR
• Absent ABR to click and TB stimuli
• Mixed hearing loss

Ok, I will check my equipment when I 
get back to the office…What about 
OAEs?

TEOAEs
• Stimulus: Brief click or tone burst
– Click spectrum should be relatively smooth
• TEOAE response above noise floor – pass
• No TEOAE response above noise floor - fail
• Prevalence in normal hearing individuals – 99+%
– Some people have no TEOAEs but have normal hearing
• Significant clinical value



DPOAEs
• Stimulus: 
– Pairs of tones are presented across 1000- 6000 Hz
– OAE response = 2f1 - f2
• Prevalence in normal hearing individuals – 99+%
• Stimulus: Two pure tones
• Significant clinical value

Need for Behavioral Test Methods  
• Behavioral methods assess hearing
• Assessment is part of intervention
• Not all infants are assessed before 6 months--must 
not always rely on objective methods

Behavioral Assessment

Test technique
• Visual Reinforcement Audiometry - VRA
• Conditioned Play Audiometry - CPA
• and variations in between –
VROCA, TROCA

Test technique as a function of age
• VRA beginning at 5-6 months to 2 years
• Play audiometry 3 to 4 years 
• Audiometrically Adult  ~ 6 years
• Developmental age is the key
• What about 2??

Conditioned Audiometry Caveat
Really no different than testing adults
• Instructions > Conditioning
• Stimuli are the same
• Response: hand raise > head turn or play task 
• Reinforcement: feedback re correct responses
But, you’ll need room for these accommodations …

Identifying Hearing Loss in Newborns 
- Jean Johnson, P.I. 
Johnson et al., Pediatrics 116(3), Sept 2005
AJA, Dec 2005

Behavioral validation of hearing status
• monaural thresholds
• speech and tones (1, 2, 4 kHz)
ATPM   .5, 1, 2, 4 kHz
• Minimum response level of 20  dB HL
ATPM   15 dB HL
• at  8 - 12 months corrected age
• Visual Reinforcement Audiometry
• 3000+ babies at risk for hearing loss
ATPM 1000 babies   

Requirements of a Behavioral Protocol
We have a protocol for adults.  
Do we have one for babies? 
• Tight enough to be assured we’re all doing it the 
same way
• Loose enough to accommodate individual infant 
differences/preferences
• Do-able within one visit 

Instructions:  Conditioning
Stimulus and Reinforcement paired
• Initial training/conditioning must be perceptible
- Level that is audible
• For infants with severe to profound hearing loss: 
- Vibrotactile stimulus
- Low frequency bone conducted stimulus
• For infants with normal hearing, a spontaneous head 
turn (repeated) may be sufficient for conditioning

• Speech or tones?
• Soundfield speakers or earphones
ATPM results: 
Success in VRA did NOT correlate with 
conditioning factors such as beginning stimulus 
type  or beginning transducer  
Stimuli and transducers- conditioning

Have instructions have been understood?
• Demonstrate understanding of task with probe 
trials, before descending in level to bracket 
threshold, i.e. demonstrate stimulus control
... the strength of the discriminative stimulus  
(tones, speech) in producing the desired 
response (head turn) 
• Get to this point quickly, i.e. 2 consecutive  
correct responses

Transducers – threshold testing
Babies wear earphones

• Pure tones:  Warbled,  pulsed, 
or narrow bands of noise?
VRA as a function of bandwidth:  Once the child is under 
stimulus control, VRA threshold is not influenced by stimulus 
type  e.g. broad band, narrow band or pure tones are effective 
in eliciting responses   Thompson & Folsom, 1985
• Speech for SAT
Stimuli - threshold testing

Test Stimulus Duration
• 2 sec  warbled or pulsed tones
• Onset vs offset
if you don’t turn it off, you won’t get a response
OR 
if you wait long enough, you’ll get a head turn 
no matter what

Test frequencies and sequence
• .5 , 1, 2, 4 kHz
• Order of test frequencies determined 
according to referral question and/or 
preliminary information
• SAT first or later?
• Frequency  jump around
• Keep track of responses and
stimuli that didn’t get responses
• One ear first, then the other?

Threshold procedures 
Stepsize
Carhart & Jerger:  5 dB
VRA:  10 dB?  5 dB?
Test-retest reliability will reflect stepsize

Threshold testing protocol
• Stopping rules  
• Threshold vs. minimal response levels?
• Air and Bone Conduction?
(

Control Trials
Silent intervals, just like stimulus trials, but 
with no reinforcement
... to check validity 
... to provide feedback to examiner in 
test room

Tips from the Trade:
Consider a “fill-in-the-blank” audiogram
• Quickly establish several soundfield thresholds to 
condition/observe how child responds to sound 
• Obtain insert responses at frequencies that would 
determine general slope of HL and/or symmetry 
between ears (2k, .5k)
• Obtain bone conduction responses to determine SN vs. 
CHL
• Continue to “fill-in-the-blank” until the child 
tires or at subsequent visits until a 
complete audiometric profile is obtained

Interpretation
• Does the rigor of the 
protocol affect 
interpretation?
• Why the difference 
across studies?
• Is the difference in 
the details?

Auditory Behavior Index
•
Typical sound-field MRLs for Normal Hearing 
Children Birth to 24 months
•
Levels required for minimum response 
- Younger infants > older infants
- Pure tones >>  Noise bands >> Speech

Most Common Pitfalls of VRA Testing
Bamford, Gliddon, Green, Munro, Parry, Sutton  & 
Wood
• Attempting conditioning to subthreshold stimuli
• Not  establishing clear  responses at suprathreshold 
before descending to threshold
• Not using time efficiently, often spending too long at 
high intensities
• Incorrect scoring as true responses i.e. scoring of 
movement other than a clear head-turn, or false 
positive  (checking) responses

Most Common Pitfalls of VRA Testing, cont
• Use of toys or behavior by Tester 2 (or parent) that 
are too distracting for child and so inhibit responses 
• Distinct and/or rhytmical phasing of attention by 
Tester 2 such that response cues are given to the 
patient.
• Overemphasis on quantity of results (number of 
thresholds obtained) rather than quality (reliability) 
of those thresholds obtained.
• Inadequate test set-up and communication between 
testers

We’ve to the results.  Now what?

• Audiologists need to be forthright in providing 
information to parents, but also willing to listen and 
reflect on the concerns and priorities
• Inexperienced clinicians may provide more 
information that a family can 
comprehend, especially at the time of diagnosis
Counseling 

• When delivering difficult news, give families an 
opportunity to respond and express their feelings; don't 
be afraid of a little silence
• Families need hope based on the knowledge that much 
can and will be done to help them and their child
• The support of other parents is vital to many families
Counseling

• Present information in parent’s primary language 
• Use professional interpreters when needed and 
whenever possible
• Use language that is below the parent’s language , 
keeping sentences short 
Counseling

Counseling
• Remember the family is the ‘patient’
• Respect the family’s rights to chose
• Think of the family as a partner

Wow—that is a lot of stuff….
What do I do now???
Do I need to do the same thing for every
child?

• At the outset of each clinic appointment ask families 
what they are hoping to accomplish visits. Return to 
their priorities at the conclusion of the visit to determine 
if their goals were met and confirm agreement on next 
steps
Points to Remember

Case Example 1
• Baby (6 week old) is referred because she did not 
pass the newborn hearing screening in the hospital 
or the re-screen and an evaluation is now needed. 
• What do you need to do?

Case Example 2
• Baby was referred for audiologic evaluation because 
of risk indicator for late onset hearing loss.  He 
passed his newborn screening and is now 4 months 
old.  
• What do you need to do? 

Case Example 3
• Toddler is referred for an audiologic evaluation 
because he did not pass the pre-school hearing 
screening (OAE). 

Case Example
• Child is 2 and referred because of lack of speech and 
language development. Hearing evaluation is 
needed prior to the speech-language evaluation.  

Tips:  Case History
• Can mail ahead of time, interview style, form completed 
in waiting room
• Failure to obtain a sufficient history may reduce the 
value of the evaluation or lead to error(s)
• Provides information about the child’s cognitive and 
developmental status and estimate of child’s auditory 
skills
• Guides your selection of test protocol
– What’s first?
– What technique?
– Is the child hearing impaired or is the test inappropriate?
