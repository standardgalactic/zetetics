Update on the College
Dan Huttenlocher, Dean
Fall, 2021

Vision for the College
Computing – from hardware, to software, to algorithms, to AI – is becoming 
part of the intellectual fabric of every field 
But the pace and scale of change are overwhelming conventional research 
and education pathways
The College is transforming computing at MIT to address these limitations 
and better serve the nation and the world
Skyrocketing demand 
for CS programs and 
classes
Relevant advances 
often not accessible 
to those in other 
fields
Broad and rapid 
applicability calls for 
better understanding 
of implications

Common Ground for Computing 
Education
•
Multi-department collaborations to 
meet needs beyond single one
•
Develop blended and integrated 
computing classes and curricula 
•
A key aspect of educating computing 
“bilinguals” – those in other fields
Social and Ethical 
Responsibilities of Computing 
(SERC)
•

regarding impacts of computing, 
incorporating multiple perspectives
•
Approaches to teaching and 
research

Responsible deployment

DEI Approach
• Focus on creating and supporting a culture of belonging – where people 
feel welcome and encouraged
• Approaches to DEI work differ – seek to engage in respectful and 
sometimes challenging discussions to broaden our understanding and 
inclusivity
• Improving the diversity of graduate programs – warrants particular focus 
and innovative solutions, given the lower diversity relative to 
undergraduates at MIT
• Alana Anderson, newly hired Assistant Dean for DEI, is helping support us 
in these objectives

DEI Example: Thriving Stars
EECS THRIVING STARS GOALS
ü

Education

Educating “Computing Bilinguals”
• Infusing coordinated computing education across disciplines
• Blended majors – beyond simply combining two, such as double major or 
major and minor (requires faculty engagement between programs)
• Freeze on additional blended majors until better understood
• Common Ground – subjects that bring together forefront of computing with 
problems and methods from various domains
• Ties to SERC – integrated education on social and ethical aspects of 
computing

Blended CS Majors
New Majors:
6-14: CS, Economics 
& Data Science
6-9: Computation 
& Cognition
•
Launched in 2017
•
108 (128) students Fall 21
•
Launched in 2019
•
159 (166) students Fall 21
6-7: CS & 
Molecular Biology
•
Launched in 2011
•
70 (71) students Fall 21
11-6: Urban Science 
& Planning with CS
•
Launched in 2019
•
16 students Fall 21
The blended majors are at 
least as large as the non-
computing majors in those 
departments (and additive)

Common Ground for Computing Education
• Coordinated education for “computing bilinguals” across disciplines
• Classes and curricula meeting “common” needs and perspectives of 
multiple programs – developed and offered jointly by two or more 
departments
• Three current focal areas, plus coordination with SERC
• Fundamentals of Programming and Computational Thinking
• ML/AI/DataSci/Algorithms in Science, Engineering and Social Science
• Fundamentals of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)
Multi-departmental collaborations across MIT

Premises of the Common Ground
• Departments are powerful for discipline-specific education, but cross-
cutting approach is important for educating “bilinguals”
• Collaborations between faculty across departments are a key aspect –
expertise for integration of relevant material and perspectives
• Value to and support of departments critical: for students (needs to satisfy 
requirements) and for sustainability (needs staffing commitments)
• Beyond individual subjects, coordinated and academically coherent cross-
cutting curricula are important for students and employers 

Common Ground Pilot Subjects
2020-21 Pilots
Introduction to Computational Science 
and Engineering (16.0002/18.0002)
Linear Algebra and Optimization 
(18.061)
Modeling with ML: from Algorithms to 
Applications (6.402/6.482, et al)

Synergies: AI And Natural Intelligence
The Quest views the engineering of artificial intelligence and the scientific 
understanding of natural intelligence as interlocking aspects of a single, 
collaborative grand challenge
Missions each address foundational questions of natural intelligence where current AI falls 
short, to advance both the science and the AI
The Development of Intelligence, led by Josh Tenenbaum and Vikash Mansinghka, 
seeks to engineer a system that learns the way a person does, starting as a baby
Embodied Intelligence, led by Leslie Kaelbling and Nancy Kanwisher, seeks to design 
and develop modular and compositional intelligent behavior in physical agents
New Hardware Architectures for Intelligence, led by Bilge Yildiz and Jesus del 
Alamo, seeks to emulate biological learning utilizing electrochemically tunable 
synapses, for better and more energy-efficient neural networks
Collective Intelligence, led by Tom Malone, Aleksander Madry and Jacob Andreas, 
seeks to enable effective collaboration of multiple humans and machines
