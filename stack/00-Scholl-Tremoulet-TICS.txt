Imagine viewing simple movies of the following sort:
(1) Two small squares are sitting in a line, separated by
several inches. The first square (A) moves in a straight line
until it reaches the second square (B), at which point A
stops moving and B starts moving along the same trajectory.
(2) Two small squares are sitting in a line, separated by
several inches. The first square (A) begins moving in a
straight line towards the second square (B). As soon as A
gets close to B, B begins moving quickly away from A in a
random direction, until it is again several inches from A, at
which point it stops. A continues all the while to move
straight towards B’s position, wherever that is at any given
moment. This pattern repeats several times.
Objectively, all that is happening in such movies is the
kinematics described above. Perceptually, however, a strik-
ing thing happens: in the first movie, you see A cause the mo-
tion of B, and in the second movie, you see A and B as alive,
and perhaps as having certain intentional states, such as A
wanting to catch B, and B trying to escape (such movies –
and movies of all the figures in this article –  can be viewed
at 
http://wjh.harvard.edu/~scholl/demos/Michotte.html).
These are examples of what have been called ‘functional re-
lations’1, wherein one perceives various properties in simple
displays that are found objectively in neither the actual
events themselves nor in their retinal projections.
Such phenomena were first studied in the early 1900s,
and later captured the attention of many psychologists with
the publication of Michotte’s book The Perception of
Causality1, and of Heider and Simmel’s classical article ‘An
experimental study of apparent behavior’2. The importance
of such phenomena stems partially from the fact that al-
though they seem to be largely perceptual in nature – to be
fairly fast, automatic, irresistible and highly stimulus-driven
– they nevertheless yield impressions such as causality and
animacy, which are typically associated with higher-level
cognitive processing. This research suggests that just as the
visual system works to recover the physical structure of the
world by inferring properties such as 3-D shape, so too does
it work to recover the causal and social structure of the
world by inferring properties such as causality and animacy.
One especially intriguing aspect of these phenomena is
how simple and spare the stimuli can be, with visual displays
containing only a few small-moving 2-D geometric shapes.
This article focuses on recent work using such displays, and
does not discuss other experiments on animacy that have
used more specialized stimuli such as faces3, hands4 or the
biological motion of ‘point-light walkers’5. It is also re-
stricted to those studies that have investigated the perception
of causality and animacy. Of course, there is also a wealth of
research on when adults and children of all ages will infer the
existence of a cause or an animate being6,7. (This distinction
between perceived and inferred causality and animacy is
discussed at length in the final section of this article.)
In sum, this article discusses cases in which very simple
displays give rise to surprisingly high-level percepts. That
perceptual systems can produce such high-level impressions
perhaps seems more intuitive when one considers the per-
ceptual recovery of other less exotic properties such as 3-D
structure8. Some basic visual features (e.g. local orientation)
can be recovered fairly directly, whereas others (e.g. depth)
cannot be unambiguously extracted from retinal projections
without making various other assumptions – for example,
the heuristic assumption of rigid objects that the visual sys-
tem makes in some situations in order to extract structure
from motion9. Such assumptions often appear to be hard-
wired into the visual system, and are thus implicit, un -
reportable and distinct from higher-level cognitive interpre-
tations10. In such cases, methods from psychophysics and
experimental psychology can be used to discover these  
assumptions, and they can be demonstrated in salient ways

Perceptual causality and
animacy
Brian J. Scholl and Patrice D. Tremoulet
Certain simple visual displays consisting of moving 2-D geometric shapes can give rise to
percepts with high-level properties such as causality and animacy. This article reviews
recent research on such phenomena, which began with the classic work of Michotte and
of Heider and Simmel. The importance of such phenomena stems in part from the fact
that these interpretations seem to be largely perceptual in nature – to be fairly fast,
automatic, irresistible and highly stimulus driven – despite the fact that they involve
impressions typically associated with higher-level cognitive processing. This research
suggests that just as the visual system works to recover the physical structure of the
world by inferring properties such as 3-D shape, so too does it work to recover the causal
and social structure of the world by inferring properties such as causality and animacy.

by using simple schematic displays that satisfy the assump-
tions in the most minimal way possible. This is what the
‘kinetic depth effect’11 does for the case of computing struc-
ture from motion, for instance, and we suggest that this is
exactly what Michotte, Heider and their contemporary
academic descendants have done for causality and animacy.
The remainder of this article is organized into three sec-
tions. In the first, we review contemporary research that has
been conducted on perceptual causality. In the second, we
review recent research on perceptual animacy. Finally, in
the concluding section, we evaluate the evidence for the
allegedly perceptual nature of such phenomena.
Perceptual causality
Foundations
The landmark work on the perception of causality was
Michotte’s book of that name, first published in French in
1946, and later updated and translated into English in
1963 (Ref. 1). (Several of his earlier works on this topic
have been translated and gathered together in a more recent
collection12.) Michotte’s general strategy was to show ob-
servers various simple displays such as those described in
the first paragraph of this article, and to record their re-
ported percepts. The observers in Michotte’s experiments
were not well described, and appear with some exceptions
to have consisted of Michotte himself and his close col-
leagues and students. For this and other reasons, Michotte’s
methods have received much criticism, some of it rather
vigorous and well deserved13,14, though at least partially ex-
plainable in terms of the methodological zeitgeist of the
day15,16. Beyond these early criticisms, it is important to
stress that much of the data from the experiments described
in this review result from perceptual reports, and are, in this
manner, similar to investigations of other subjective visual

phenomena, such as amodal completion
or illusory contours. Evidence that such
reports reflect perceptual processing un-
contaminated by later and higher-level
interpretations is discussed in the final
section of this article.
Nearly all of Michotte’s demon-
strations were based on variations of the
launching effect described in the opening
paragraph of this article: one small object
(A) moves until it is adjacent to another
item (B), at which point A stops and B
starts moving. (Throughout this article,
‘A’ and ‘B’ refer to these respective roles.)
Such displays give rise to a version of
what Michotte called ‘phenomenal
causality’ and what others have termed
‘the illusion of causality’17: a strong per-
cept that A caused B’s motion – that A
pushed B, shoved B, ‘made it go’. In such
cases, B’s motion is not perceived as its
own, but rather as a simple continuation
of A’s motion: the percept is of two dis-
tinct items but of a single motion that is
transferred between them. The bulk of
Michotte’s demonstrations and most of
the early extensions to his work consisted
of discovering the spatiotemporal param-
eters that mediate these causal percepts,
such as the items’ relative speeds,
speed–mass interactions8,18, overall path
lengths, and spatial and temporal gaps.
Perhaps the most crucial result, however,
is simply that there are such precise con-
ditions: these percepts seem to be largely
stimulus driven, and objectively small
manipulations to the displays can cause
the causal nature of the percepts to disap-
pear. Figure 1 portrays these basic effects
and some of the manipulations explored
by Michotte. (Note that the dynamic nature of these dis-
plays is crucial to the robust percepts, as can be seen in the
online movies.)
Several researchers following Michotte attempted to
tone down some of his stronger claims. Michotte implied
that his effects were seen for all observers immediately, but
others have demonstrated that only 65% to 85% of ob-
servers report the basic launching percept upon its first pre-
sentation13,19–21. Similarly, others have demonstrated that
the robustness of the reports of causal percepts can be al-
tered with practice, for example by varying the number of
highly causal or highly non-causal intervening displays be-
fore the test displays22,23. However, as others have indicated,
many such manipulations might affect response biases
rather than the actual percepts24. And, as stressed by
White21, such amendments to Michotte’s strong claims
should not distract us from the existence of the phenomena
in the first place: ‘The remarkable thing…is that causal pro-
cessing is sufficiently irresistible to occur at all with such
imperfect stimuli’.
Contemporary studies
Much of the contemporary research on perceptual causality
has attempted to generalize the basic phenomena in various
ways. For example, it has been demonstrated that the
launching effect replicates with other types of stimuli, in-
cluding apparent motion rather than real motion17, and that
such percepts seems to be culturally universal25,26. In Morris
and Peng’s experiments25, American and Chinese observers’
percepts of launching displays did not differ, despite the fact
that these two groups had massively different patterns of
higher-level causal attribution.
Several other researchers have extended Michotte’s studies
both by continuing his exploration of the mediating spa-
tiotemporal variables, and by extending the ‘catalog’ of ‘func-
tional relations’ to include other phenomena. For example,
White and Milne created various simple displays that gave rise
to the robust percept that one object was pulling another27
(conceptually similar to Michotte’s ‘traction’ experiments).
An example of such a stimulus is shown in Fig. 2a. Here, the
middle object, which moves first, is seen to pull the others

(a) Displays that give rise to percepts of pulling. White and Milne explored the effects of several variables on this
percept, and demonstrated that: (1) strong pulling impressions are only obtained with staggered (versus simulta-
neous) motion onsets, though speed does not seem to affect the percept; (2) the duration of delay between suc-
cessive motion onsets of different items does not seem to affect the percept very much; and (3) weaker pulling per-
cepts are obtained for downward vertical motion, possibly because of gravity. They also noted that the order of
motion does not seem to be important for the existence of the pulling percept: an object is seen as ‘pulled’ as long
as any adjacent item starts moving first. (b) and (c) Displays that give rise to percepts of enforced disintegration
and bursting, respectively. For such percepts, White and Milne explored the effects of several variables such as the
speed of the initial item, the speed of the ‘fragments’ after contact and the direction and width of the arc of frag-
ment dispersal. They found that enforced disintegration percepts such as those obtained for (b) were highest when
the initial speeds were faster than the fragment speeds, and when the direction of fragment dispersal continued
the causing object’s motion and was fairly broad. For bursting, stronger percepts were obtained when the initial
speed was slower than the fragment speed, though dispersal factors did not seem to play any role.

along. As in the launching display, observers see multiple ob-
jects but only a single motion, which is phenomenally dupli-
cated in all of the items. Note, however, that this display does
not satisfy the requirements for launching itself: the initial ob-
ject actually moves away from the other items, and at no time
do two items ever contact each other. In a related study, White
and Milne carried out similar investigations of percepts they
termed enforced disintegration and bursting28 (see Fig. 2b,c),
similar to Michotte’s triggering percepts in launching displays.
In each display, one item travels until it contacts a group of
additional items, at which point they begin moving with vari-
ous speeds and in various directions. Subjects perceive such
displays in terms of salient categories such as bursting. The
pattern of mediating variables here is again fairly complex, but
the striking and important finding is just that, as with launch-
ing and entraining, these additional causal percepts seem to be
salient, immediate and irresistible, despite the fact that they
involve only geometric figures on a computer screen. (Note,
though, that although these phenomena are clearly causal and
embody additional types of ‘functional relations’, they might
not count as demonstrations of phenomenal causality per se
under Michotte’s strictest definition, wherein the existence of
only a single ‘ampliated’ motion in an event is crucial.)
In all of their experiments, White and Milne used
Natsoulas’ method of rating three different statements for each
display29, which emphasize a percept of pulling, of no interac-
tion, and of items moving on their own accord. This contrasts
with the bulk of the early research extending Michotte’s stud-
ies, which involved obtaining direct perceptual reports. Both
methods allow for effects to creep in at the response bias stage,
but are essentially ways of quantifying the qualitative percep-
tual experience, as is carried out in demonstrations of many
other subjective visual phenomena such as
amodal completions or illusory contours.
Moreover, such effects in general seem
unlikely to be entirely due to a response
bias, because of developmental work
showing that the ability to perceive causal-
ity from simple motion displays emerges
before infants have learned language.
Emergence in infancy
The most compelling evidence that per-
ceptual causality emerges early in life
comes from the work of Alan Leslie and his
colleagues30–32. In his studies, six-month-
old infants were habituated to one of sev-
eral short films based upon Michotte’s
launching displays. After habituation, in-
fants found a reversal of the film more
interesting if they had been habituated to
spatiotemporally contiguous launching
displays (see Fig. 1a) than if they had been
habituated to displays with spatial or tem-
poral gaps that degrade the causal percept
in adults (see Fig. 1c,e). Leslie argues that
the six-month-olds looked longer at re-
versed contiguous displays (compared with
reversed displays with spatial or temporal
gaps), because, although all displays in-
volved reversed kinematics, only the reversed contiguous dis-
play (Fig. 1a) involved an additional change in the causal roles
(i.e. which shape is the ‘hitter’ and which is the ‘hittee’). In
short, Leslie and his colleagues showed that six-month-olds
perceive causality when shown launching displays similar to
those that produce causal percept in adults32; later develop-
mental studies have supported and refined this picture33–38.
Perceptual animacy
From the beginning, researchers have emphasized that the
property of animacy also appears to be perceived in simple
displays2,39. Michotte even suggested that simple motion
cues provide the foundation for social perception in general:
‘In ordinary life, the specifying factors – gestures, facial ex-
pressions, speech – are innumerable and can be differen-
tiated by an infinity of nuances. But they are all additional
refinements compared with the key factors, which are the
simple kinetic structures’39. The studies of perceptual ani-
macy discussed below involve at least the perception of a
simple shape’s being alive; in addition, many of them go
even further and employ displays that give rise to the per-
ception of goals (e.g. ‘trying to get over here’) and even men-
tal states (e.g. ‘wanting to get over there’). Though there
might be important gradations of these types in animacy
percepts, they are not discussed here, and all such phenom-
ena are referred to as demonstrations of perceptual animacy.
(For a discussion of such gradations – and, in particular, one
that characterizes the goal-directedness as more primary than
the perception of a self-propelled or living element – see the
recent papers by Csibra, Gergely and colleagues40,41.)

metric figures (a large triangle, a small triangle and a small

Fig. 3. Some sequential ‘snapshots’ from a dynamic display of the type used by Heider and Simme to
demonstrate perceptual animacyl2. Observers perceive the items in such displays as being alive, and even as

small triangle).

circle) moving in the vicinity of a rectangle2 (see Fig. 3, and
the movie clip online). Although static clips of the film con-
veyed little information about the properties of the circle
and triangles, after viewing the animation observers were re-
markably consistent when asked to describe the objects.
Observers attributed personality traits (e.g. shyness, being a
bully) and emotions (e.g. frustration, anger) to the geomet-
ric figures, regardless of the instructions they were given.
Heider and Simmel explained these findings by asserting
that temporal contiguity and spatial proximity produced
phenomenal relationships among the geometric figures.
Since Heider and Simmel’s original experiment, a large
number of follow-up studies have assessed the generality
and robustness of such phenomena42. Early work suggesting
that the perception of animacy is context sensitive involved
priming the subjects with emotional information43 or giving
the moving shapes little iconic facial expressions44. This
work was inconclusive, however, as the priming study intro-
duced salient task demands, whereas the facial expressions
probably engaged distinct specialized recognition processes.
Moreover, others have demonstrated that the specific ani-
mate descriptions given to such displays are remarkably con-
sistent across a wide range of cultures25,26,45, and develop-
mental research has shown that three- and four-year-olds
also attribute desires, emotions and personalities to the
geometric shapes in Heider and Simmel’s animation46.
Other developmental work has revealed that children will
interpret simple geometric shapes as intentional agents based
upon their movement patterns40,41,47,48. Gergely, Csibra and
their colleagues, for instance, have used displays such as those
in Fig. 4 to show that relatively simple motion sequences,
which do not rely upon self-initiated movement to cue ani-
macy, can produce an impression of goal-driven behavior in
nine-month-old infants40,41. Another recent study used this
same paradigm to demonstrate that chimpanzees also seem to
attribute goals to the items in such displays (see Fig. 4; Ref. 49).
Similarly, Rochat and colleagues report that even three-
month-olds preferred to look at displays with two discs engag-
ing in systematic ‘social’ interaction (chasing) than at displays
showing the discs moving independently50. It appears that
young infants distinguish movements which specify social
causality for adults from those which do not. In another study,
nine-month-olds were habituated to stimuli containing two
non-rigidly moving squares, each modeled after Michotte’s
‘caterpillar’ displays (expanding and contracting squares that
yield an impression of self-produced, animate motion in
adults). Infants appeared to perceive causality at a distance in
their displays – that is, the infants seemed to infer that one
square causes movement in the other – without any contact
between them51. As nine-month-olds understand that inani-
mate objects cannot act upon one another from a distance,
this indicates that these infants must have derived an impres-
sion of animacy from the quality of the objects’ motions.
Recent research with adults also supports the hypothesis
that it is the motion kinematics and not the featural proper-
ties of the objects that are largely responsible for perceptual
animacy. For example, animacy is perceived even when the
simple ‘actors’ in an animation sequence are groups of items
rather than unified shapes52. In a more direct contrast be-
tween motion information and spatial properties, it was
found that a spatially quantized version of the original
Heider and Simmel movie (which selectively eliminated fea-
tural properties) hardly affected observers’ descriptions,
whereas a temporally quantized version (which selectively
eliminated motion information) resulted in a drastic reduc-
tion in reported perceptual animacy53.
Motion cues
Several researchers have attempted to discover the specific
motion cues that mediate perceptual animacy. This research

Fig. 4. Depictions of the displays used to demonstrate that both infants40,41 and chim-
panzees49 attribute goals to simple shapes in certain dynamic displays. In the studies by
Gergely, Csibra and colleagues40,41, infants as young as nine months were familiarized with
either the event depicted in (a), where a rectangle ‘jumps’ over a barrier on its trajectory to-
wards a circle, or the event depicted in (b), where the rectangle follows the identical trajectory
despite the barrier’s location off to the side. Following familiarization, infants were tested on
displays without a barrier: in the event depicted in (c), the rectangle now moves on a straight
linear path towards the circle; in the event depicted in (d), the rectangle continues to follow the
same curved path it followed during familiarization trials. Infants who were familiarized with
event (a) looked longer at event (d) than at event (c) during test trials, whereas no such differ-
ence was observed for infants familiarized to event (b). The authors explain this pattern of
results by appeal to the idea that infants interpreted event (a) in goal-directed terms, with the
rectangle trying to reach the circle via the most direct unobstructed path. Infants familiarized
with event (a) thus found event (c) to be another instance of the same goal-directed event,
whereas event (d) was perceived as more novel, despite its greater superficial similarity to the
familiarization event (a). Uller and Nichols used this same type of setup and experimental logic
(though with slightly different methods) in a looking time study with chimpanzees, and found
similar results49: the chimpanzees also appeared to attribute goals to the event depicted in (a).

program began with Bassili, who developed five computer-
controlled displays, each showing two circles moving on 
a dark background54. He discovered that a temporal
contingency between the changes in direction of two circles
produced the percept of an interaction between the figures,
and that spatial contingencies influenced the perception of
intentionality. Unfortunately, his subjects’ ratings of
animacy were highly variable, suggesting that different
observers used different cues to perceptual animacy.
More recent research has also explored the relationship
between the perception of interaction, intention, and ani-
macy. Dittrich and Lea presented adult subjects with displays
containing several randomly moving letters (distractors) and
a target letter whose movement was designed to simulate bio-
logically meaningful, intentional motion – either predatory
stalking or following a parent to keep from getting lost55.
(The second ‘movie’ from the opening paragraph of this arti-
cle is modeled on these displays.) Dittrich and Lea varied the
number of moving elements, the directness of movement of
the distractors (maximum angle of direction change between
cycles), the speed of the distractors (maximum movement be-
tween cycles), the directness of the target (maximum angular
deviation from a perfectly ‘heat-seeking’ path towards one of
the distractors chosen as a ‘sheep’ to the target’s ‘wolf’), the
speed of the target, and the ‘relentlessness’ of the target (mini-
mum movement between cycles). After viewing each display,
subjects were asked to identify which one of the characters
‘was different from the others’, and then to rate the degree to
which the selected letter appeared to be doing something
purposeful, how much it interacted with other letters and to
what extent it simulated an animate creature.
Dittrich and Lea concluded that perceiving a target’s
movement to be animate motion depended on both the de-
gree to which there appeared to be an interaction between the
target and its goal, and the impression of intentionality pro-
duced by the movement. In addition, their data indicated that
the perception of interaction depends upon the relationship
between the trajectory of the target and the trajectories of the
distractors, and that the perception of intentionality depends
upon the trajectory of the target. More specifically, their ob-
servers reported more intentional percepts from displays in
which the target’s motion was more direct, and were better at
detecting the ‘target’ object when it moved faster than the
distractors. Finally, causing the target’s ‘goal’ to be invisible
impaired but did not abolish the perceptual animacy.
Stewart also set out to investigate how motion influences
the perception of animacy (discussed in Ref. 55). Her inves-
tigation was guided by a specific hypothesis: observers
should describe an object as animate whenever its motion
‘violates Newtonian laws’. Technically, motions cannot vio-
late Newtonian laws (except for relativistic effects); however,
it is clear that what Stewart actually meant was that motions
that would require a moving body to have access to a hidden
energy source (e.g. smooth accelerations or sudden stops)
would be perceived as animate. She tested this idea, which
we will refer to as the ‘energy violation’ hypothesis, by pre-
senting subjects with several computer-generated displays
showing a single ball moving in the vicinity of static bars that
were intended to be interpreted as obstacles and boundaries.
Although some of Stewart’s findings were consistent with
her expectations, many of the motion paths that the energy
violation hypothesis predicts will be perceived as animate
were ambiguous: some of Stewart’s subjects saw them as
inanimate and some saw them as animate. Only three types
of motion consistently produced animate percepts: starts
from rest, changes in direction to avoid a collision and direct
movement towards a goal. As discussed below, however,
such effects are clearly mediated by other contextual factors;
if this were not the case, observers should report that the first
items in most launching displays (Fig. 1a) look animate,
which they do not.
In a series of follow-up experiments, Gelman and col-
leagues replicated and extended Stewart’s findings56. They
presented subjects with several computer-generated displays,
showing one or two small balls moving in ‘environments’ of
static lines and geometric shapes. These displays varied in
terms of the shapes of trajectories, the presence or absence of
a second ball and the type of environment. Gelman et al. re-
ported that observers favored animate interpretations in en-
vironments where the balls’ movements were consistent with
some aspect of the environment representing either an ob-
stacle or a goal. By contrast, observers favored inanimate in-
terpretations when balls moved in ‘odd’ environments or
when no environmental information was given. These find-
ings led Gelman and colleagues to suggest that the ability to
classify objects into animates and inanimates is not based
solely on perceptual information, but also draws upon innate
or early-developing knowledge of causal principles (a sugges-
tion that contrasts with other conclusions, as is discussed
again below). By contrast, Blythe and colleagues have argued
that a small set of motion cues can be sufficient not only to
determine whether or not a moving object is animate, but
also to determine what intention motivated the object’s
movement57. They present an algorithm that uses seven mo-
tion cues to predict observers’ responses when asked to as-
sign displays to one of six intentional categories. They then
go on to suggest that people and other animals might use an
algorithm such as this to infer the intentions of moving enti-
ties. This work is important when one considers that many
other researchers have focused on the perception of inten-
tion from motion when viewing such displays40,41,54–56,58.
Cues mediating the perception of animacy in simple displays
In general, the displays used to investigate the perception of
animacy and the perception of intentionality have been
longer, have had more complex trajectories and/or have had
more complex environments (which might include moving
elements) than the displays used to investigate the percep-
tion of causality. This has made it difficult to conduct a rig-
orous analysis of the mediating factors of perceptual animacy
(similar to the one conducted by Michotte and others for
perceptual causality). However, Tremoulet and Feldman
have recently made progress in this direction59. They created
extremely simple stimuli showing a single white particle
moving across a featureless dark background (see Fig. 5 for
details). In cases where the trajectories were the same, other
factors such as the local orientation of the particles through-
out their trajectories impacted the strength of the resulting
animacy percepts – a result that refutes the notion that per-
ceiving energy violations is all there is to perceiving animacy.

The most important contribution of Tremoulet and
Feldman’s recent study is not its refutation of the ‘energy
violation’ hypothesis, however, but rather its demonstration
that the combination of two extremely simple, highly percep-
tible motions (change in speed and change in direction) can
produce an impression of animacy, even when presented in a
featureless background. Follow-up experiments suggest that
this extremely simple motion path might convey intentional-
ity despite the absence of a goal or context; if a single static dot
is added to the backgrounds of these displays, the strength of
the animacy percept depends upon the location of the dot
(this replicates the finding of Gelman and colleagues that the
visual environment can influence the perception of animacy).
More research is underway to investigate how context and
motion interact to create an impression of animacy.
Initial evidence from cognitive neuroscience
Other very recent studies have addressed perceptual animacy
using tools drawn from cognitive neuroscience, and have
begun to link such phenomena more closely to the underlying
brain structures. Heberlein and colleagues showed the original
Heider and Simmel movie to a patient with amygdala damage,
who (unlike normal observers and other brain-damaged con-
trols) did not describe them using any social or anthropomor-
phic terms60. This supports the idea that the amygdala is a cru-
cial part of the system that mediates social perception61. Happé
and Frith62 have also made a first attempt to localize perceptual
animacy in the brain using neuroimaging techniques. They
conducted a PET study using these types of display, contrast-
ing random movement with goal-directed movement 
(e.g. chasing) and intentional movement (e.g. mocking), and
found that these latter displays elicited more activity than the
random-movement displays in the tempoparietal junction,
fusiform gyrus, occipital gyrus and medial frontal cortex.
A link between perceptual and
cognitive processing?
Having reviewed the recent empirical
work on the nature of perceptual causality
and animacy, we now address the allegedly
perceptual nature of these phenomena
more directly. As noted above, one of the
reasons that such phenomena are interest-
ing is that they both have the character of
visual percepts yet involve what are tradi-
tionally thought to be higher-level con-
cepts. Without this perceptual nature,
these phenomena are of much less interest.
After all, it is of no great surprise that one
can conceive of some visual object as caus-
ing some action, as animate, or as anything
you wish. But to the degree that such
phenomena reflect perceptual processing,
their existence is more interesting: they
suggest that perceptual processes have
more to do with domains previously
considered to be purely cognitive.
Most of the controversy surrounding
perceptual causality and animacy has fo-
cused on whether such processing can be
considered innate. Michotte, for instance, frequently down-
played experiential effects when discussing perceptual causality,
citing as evidence the universality of the percepts, their seeming
encapsulation from higher order interpretations (what he
called ‘negative’ and ‘paradoxical’ cases), and the high corre-
lation between the character of the stimuli and the resulting
percepts, with ‘the distribution of response frequencies gener-
ally showing the usual pattern for psychophysical functions. In
the case of acquired meaning…the link between stimulation
and response is usually much weaker’63. Some contemporary
researchers have supported this position32,35,48,64, whereas others
have argued that the evidence for innateness is inconclu-
sive6,8,27,38. This controversy will not be reviewed here, however,
as the frequent discussion of innateness has often been an ill-
fitting stand-in for the perceptual nature of these phenomena
(for reasons discussed below). We will simply conclude that the
issue is unresolved, noting only that experiential effects might
often be localized to response biases (see Schlottman and
Anderson24 for a discussion of several subtleties), and that in
general the existence of an innate origin is quite compatible
with a wide variety of experiential and developmental effects65.
Modular processing
Rather than focusing on innateness as a substitute for the
perceptual nature of these phenomena, we suggest that this
issue might be better characterized by appeal to the notion
of modularity. Modules, as discussed by Fodor66, are spe-
cial-purpose mechanisms – parts of the mind, analogous to
organs of the body – that are characterized by restrictions on
information flow. On the one hand, a module’s processing
is encapsulated from external information, so that, for ex-
ample, learning that the Müller-Lyer illusion is an illusion
does not cause it to go away, because the visual mechanisms
that construct the percept are encapsulated from that belief.

Fig. 5. Examples of the three particle types used in displays created by Tremoulet and Feldman to in-
vestigate the minimal conditions for perceptual animacy59. The particles’ motion paths were short and un-
complicated: initially, a particle moved in a random direction at a constant speed for 375 ms, then it simultaneously
changed both speed and direction, and continued at the new speed in the new direction for another 375 ms. Three
different particle types were compared: (a) a simple circle (the ‘dot condition’); (b) a rectangle which changed ori-
entation as it changed direction, so its principal axis was always aligned with the direction of motion (the ‘aligned’
condition); and (c) a rectangle that started out aligned with the direction of motion, but did not change orientation
as it changed direction (the ‘misaligned’ condition). Particles in (b) appeared most animate, followed by particles in
(a). In both these conditions, the impression of animacy grew stronger with increases in angle of direction change
(f) and increases in final speed (Vf). By contrast, particles in (c) did not look animate to most observers.
Corresponding displays from (a) and (c) (that is, displays with the same speed and direction changes) always con-
tained precisely the same motion paths [whereas the corresponding display from (b) might have included a ro-
tation]. Thus, all increases in energy contained in display in (a) were also contained in the corresponding display in
(c). However, observers rated the particles in (a) as more likely to be animate than the particles in (c). Therefore,
there must be more to inferring animacy than simply perceiving increases in energy.

On the other hand, external processes receive a module’s
output, but cannot get inside to the ‘interlevels’ of process-
ing: this can explain, for instance, why we easily recognize
objects and faces without any insight into how we do so.
Because of such restrictions, modules are typically fast, auto-
matic, mandatory and are often innately specified66,67. Note,
however, that modules need not be innate! In addition to
both the fact that modules might require environmental ‘trig-
gering’ to come online and the possibility that modules might
develop from ‘scratch’ over time, based on experience68,
Scholl and Leslie note that there is nothing in the notion of
modularity to prevent a module from tuning itself on the
basis of the information that does characterize its input65: the
essence of modularity identifies restrictions on information
flow to and from the module, but places no restrictions on
what a module does internally with the information it does
receive. (This is one point that speaks against those theorists
who argue against modularity simply on the basis of an ob-
servable instance of development38.) Modules can thus be in-
nate, acquired or some mixture thereof, and to the extent that
the notion of modularity captures the ‘perceptual’ nature of
these phenomena, debates about innateness prove irrelevant.
To what degree do phenomena of perceptual causality
and animacy appear to reflect modular perceptual processing?
To begin with, these phenomena do seem to enjoy most of the
traditional ‘symptoms’ of modularity. They are domain-
specific by definition, in that they result in specific causal and
intentional interpretations (i.e. they give rise to only a few
qualitatively separate types of percepts). They are also entirely
visual phenomena (though it is an interesting question
whether similar effects might be observable in other modal-
ities). Precisely what visual information serves as the input to
such a module remains to be determined. The results of
Gelman and colleagues discussed above56 suggest that the
computation of animacy is carried out ‘not by motion alone’,
although we would argue that the additional contextual fac-
tors might still be visually (and not conceptually) derived. The
timecourse of such phenomena is very fast: phenomenologi-
cally these causal and animate percepts occur nearly instanta-
neously upon viewing the displays. They are also mandatory
in the way that most visual illusions are: to the degree that the
events are clearly perceived (perhaps attended and/or fix-
ated69), the causal or animate nature of the resulting percepts
is nearly irresistible. This reflects a type of encapsulation:
despite the fact that observers know that the displays are not
really causal or animate, this knowledge does not appear to be
taken into account by the mechanisms that construct the
percepts. Conversely, higher-level external processes do not
seem to have access to the ‘interlevels’ of this processing: we
are greeted with causal percepts when viewing launching
displays, for instance, without any ability to determine how
they came about. Like recognizing speech or recognizing a
face, recognizing physical causality in such situations seems
phenomenologically just to ‘happen’ quite automatically.
Automaticity
Michotte referred to this as the ‘immediacy’ of the percepts,
and indeed he stressed most of these hallmarks of modularity
in his writings1,39,63: ‘[T]his is not just a “meaning” attributed
to the literal, step-by-step translation of a table of stimuli; they
are primitive specific impressions which arise in the perceptual
field itself’. More contemporary research also supports this
view. For instance, Dittrich and Lea stress the apparently
mandatory and data-driven nature of the percepts in their dis-
plays55. They note that ‘[T]he instructions given to the sub-
jects made very little difference to any dependent measure,
while virtually all parameters of motion had some straightfor-
ward effects’, and they conclude that ‘The immediate impres-
sion of intentionality (or causality) is given by a “bottom-up”
process of selecting specific motion features’. It is important to
realize, however, that this automaticity and irresistibility
might often depend on clearly perceiving and perhaps attend-
ing to the event. For example, infants’ attention can be dis-
tracted from the relevant event in launching displays when
multiple featurally complex objects are used33,34,36,38.
White stresses the speed of perceptual causality21. His
thesis is that all of the important processing with regard to
such stimuli integrates over less than 250 ms in a chunk at
the ‘iconic’ stage, and is therefore ‘automatic’ rather than
‘controlled’ (in the sense of Shiffrin and Schneider70).
Similarly, Premack argues that ‘the infant’s concept [of in-
tention] is an automatic reading of a perceptual input’48,
based on the detection of self-propulsion. Blythe and col-
leagues propose that humans rely upon a simple innate
heuristic that automatically determines the intentions of
moving agents57; effectively, they too claim that observers
automatically perceive intention in motion. One remaining
problem for such claims of automaticity is the fact (described
above) that there are considerable individual differences in
the rates of reported perceptual causality and animacy upon
the very first presentations of typical displays. Existing
accounts involving automaticity have failed to address such
data, and to address empirically the suspicion that such
differences are due to some subjects reporting more consid-
ered interpretations of the displays rather than their
percepts. (Michotte noted, however, that even observers who
do not perceive causality upon their first encounter with a
launching event will do so spontaneously after repeated
presentations, and do not require any explicit instruction1.)
Leslie has worked out the most explicit proposal for a
modular basis for perceptual causality64,71. He notes that
‘To suggest that there is such a thing as a perceptual illusion
of causality is to imply that there is a rather humble percep-
tual mechanism operating automatically and incorrigibly
upon the spatio-temporal properties of events yet producing
abstract descriptions of their causal structure…Taking
input from lower level motion-processing, this device will
parse submovements, produce higher-level descriptions of
the spatio-temporal properties of the event, and produce a
description of its causal structure’64. (For further details of
Leslie’s theory, see Refs 31,32,35,64,71.) Of course, many
important unanswered questions remain about the nature
of such a mechanism. What, for instance, is the format of
the ‘causal’ interpretation that results from such processing?
Is such a mechanism simply wired to return an explicit
causal description of the event, similar in format to that
which might be obtained by higher-level and more domain-
general reflection? Or, is the causal interpretation generated
in the way that an interpretation of depth might be gener-
ated, in an entirely visuospatial format?

Some of the most direct evidence for automaticity and en-
capsulation comes from the recent work of Anne Schlottmann
and her colleagues, who have directly contrasted causal
perception and causal inference72,73. In one study,
Schlottmann and Shanks72 studied such issues in launching
displays by testing whether factors known to affect causal in-
ference also affected causal percepts. In assessing causation be-
tween some pair of events A and B, the existence of a third
event C that better co-varies with B will steal the ‘judged
cause’ of B away from A. Schlottmann and Shanks imple-
mented such a situation in a launching event, where the ad-
ditional co-variate was a brief and momentary color change,
the end of which always coincided with the movement of B. B
moved on every trial following this color change, which was
also sometimes – but not always – correlated with A’s arrival.
With careful instructions distinguishing perceived and judged
causality, they found that the color change had no effect on
the perceived causality: despite the imperfect correlation, the
perceived cause of B’s movement was always the arrival of A
when it did correlate. In explicit judgments, by contrast, the
existence of the easily perceived higher correlation with color
change led to the inference that B’s motion was in fact caused
by the color change. In general, they noted that the ‘factors
that influence judgments of causality have no detectable effect
on the perception of causality in launch events’.
Conclusions
The available evidence concerning the perception of causality
and animacy is largely consistent with the view that such phe-
nomena reflect primarily perceptual and perhaps modular
processing, and at a minimum are very different (and can be
dissociated) from high-level cognitive judgments of the exist-
ence of causality or animacy. This view can be seen as an up-
dated version of the classical theories of such phenomena (in-
cluding Michotte’s theory), and it contrasts with many other
recent views6,8,24,38,56,74. White takes a contrasting view in a re-
cent book, and argues against a modular interpretation by
appeal to the lack of ecological validity in most of these ex-
periments6: ‘It does not seem likely that there would be an in-
built visual mechanism for perceiving event sequences that
would rarely if ever be encountered in a natural, as opposed
to human-made, environment’. But such a mechanism pre-
sumably does work in naturalistic events. The situation might
be entirely analogous to less controversial processes, such as
the extraction of structure from motion. Here is a case where
the visual system appears to make hardwired and plausibly in-
nate assumptions about the world, which vision scientists
have uncovered and made salient in simple ‘toy’ displays,
such as the kinetic depth effect, which satisfy the built-in as-
sumptions in as minimal a way as possible. Michotte, Heider
and their contemporary academic descendants have done the
same thing for causality and animacy: they have used ‘toy’
displays to eliminate confounding noise, and to distill the
precise rules that the visual system appears to use when
recovering the causal and social structure of the world.
This article has attempted to review recent evidence for
what such rules might look like, and to discuss their nature and
relation to perceptual and cognitive processing. The phenom-
ena of perceptual causality and animacy might indeed reflect
some specialized perceptual processing that is not easily ‘pene-
trated’ by higher-level cognition. In this sense, such phenom-
ena are of interest in that they lie at an intersection of percep-
tual and cognitive processing, where simple schematic displays
are parsed via perceptual systems in causal, animate or even in-
tentional terms – properties traditionally associated with
higher-level cognitive processing. The continued study of these
phenomena will help elucidate the scope of perceptual process-
ing, and much work remains to be done (see Outstanding
questions). Indeed, rarely in experimental psychology or vision
science has such a rich set of phenomena been so understudied.
This is at least partially attributable to the technical difficulty in
the past of working with such dynamic displays, but today such
displays are trivially easy to generate, and in the near future it
should be possible to characterize comprehensively the precise
stimulus conditions that give rise to these percepts in order to
discover the perceptual ‘grammar’ of causality and animacy.

Review
Outstanding questions
• What is the relationship between perceptual causality and perceptual
animacy, which have been treated together in this article? Are they
mediated by the same mechanisms or by distinct mechanisms that work on
similar principles? Are they mediated by the same or separate brain areas?
Additional neuroimaging research could perhaps address these questions.
• More generally, are perceptual causality and animacy part of a larger
integrated system of social perception, or are they relatively isolated
instances of more specific perceptual heuristics?
• What is the relationship of attention to the phenomena discussed here?
Cavanagh and colleagues have recently demonstrated that attention is
necessary to perceive biological motion and other simple perceptual
events75. Is attention necessary to perceive causality and animacy? Are
causality and animacy evident in a noisy display even when attention is
otherwise distracted? To what degree will animate objects capture
attention? Similarly, might eye movements play a mediating role in the
perception of causality and animacy69? The answers to these questions
are the topic of our current research.
• More specifically, how might these phenomena be represented on the
level of object-based attention, by mechanisms such as object files or
object indexes76,77? Could such a level of representation explain the
details of the ‘launching’ percepts?
• To the degree that these phenomena appear to be modular in nature,
we might expect them to be independently disruptible by brain damage
or strokes. Are there any neuropsychological syndromes that involve such
deficits?
• Do animals other than humans also perceive causality and animacy in all
the same situations, and based on the same stimulus factors? Studies
have now begun to look at animacy in non-human primates49,78, but it
remains to be seen how much such initial results will generalize to other
species and other stimuli. One writer has suggested that only tool-
making species will evidence perceptual causality79.
• All of the phenomena discussed here occur in the visual domain. Are there
any auditory or tactile analogues of perceptual causality or animacy?

Genomic imprinting refers to the silencing of one allele of
a gene according to its parental origin1. The cellular mecha-
nisms underlying genomic imprinting are not completely
understood but it is known that the ‘imprint mark’ occurs
during gametogenesis (the production of the sperm or egg)
and involves a parent-specific molecular tagging of one of the
alleles (Box 1). In the progeny, this leads to a selective silenc-
ing of an allele that depends on its parental origin, which in
turn, results in the parent-specific monoallelic expression of
the trait associated with that imprinted locus. The upshot of
these complex molecular events is a form of inheritance that
passes on traits down the maternal or paternal line, via
maternal or paternally expressed genes, in contrast to the
more-frequent biallelic inheritance of traits that is indifferent
to the parental origin of the allele.
One pervasive, though not exclusive2, argument has it
that the evolutionary fire driving such a mode of inheritance
is related to conflict between the sexes that arises as a result of
sexual (as opposed to asexual) reproduction. That is, to put it
simply, while males and females need each other to effect

Imprinted genes, cognition
and behaviour
Anthony R. Isles and Lawrence S. Wilkinson
The idea that genes can influence behavioural predispositions and their underlying
psychological determinants is becoming increasingly tractable. In this article, recent
findings are reviewed on a special type of inheritance, related to the transmission of
traits via what have been termed ‘imprinted’ genes. In imprinted genes one allele is
silenced according to its parental origin. This results in the inheritance of traits down
the maternal or paternal line, in contrast to the more frequent mode of inheritance that is
indifferent to the parental origin of the allele. Drawing on the advances made possible by
combining the approaches of cognitive neuropsychology, behavioural neuroscience and
contemporary molecular genetics, the detailed evidence for imprinted effects on
behavioural and cognitive phenotypes is considered, focusing on findings from mental
disorders, Turner’s syndrome and experimental work in animal models. As prevailing
evolutionary theories stress an essential antagonistic role of imprinted effects, these
data might link such apparently diverse issues as neurodevelopment and the
vulnerability to mental disease with the ‘battle of the sexes’, as joined at the level of
cognitive and behavioural functioning.
