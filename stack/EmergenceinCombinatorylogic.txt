Emergence in Combinatory logic 
 
The statement "1 + 1 = 2" being represented as "C I D = D" in combinatory logic is an example of an 
emergent property because we start with basic building blocks (the combinators) and through their 
interaction (using C to apply I and D), we arrive at a result (D) that represents a more complex 
mathematical relationship. The emergent property arises from the interaction of these simple 
elements within the system. 
 
Can we consider this particular framework as an example of the notion of emergence in 
Combinatory Logic ? 
 
The Mockingbird combinator is one of the basic building blocks in combinatory logic it 
represents the self-application behavior, meaning that it applies its argument to itself,...and 
still in combinatory logic, the emergence of complex behavior and properties is closely 
related to the existence and behavior of combinators like the Mockingbird combinator. The 
Mockingbird combinator is a fundamental element in combinatory logic that plays a role in 
demonstrating the concept of emergence in this mathematical system. 
 
According the combinatory logic 1+1 = 2 is written as : C I D = D 
 
I is the identity combinator, which means I x is equivalent to x. 
C is the function application combinator, which means C f x is equivalent to f x. 
D is the mockingbird combinator, which means D x = x x. 
 
Now, let's break down 1 + 1 = 2: 
• 
1 is represented by I. 
• 
"+" is represented by C. 
So, in terms of combinatory logic, 1 + 1 = 2 would be written as: 
 
C I D = D 
 
This expression is saying that applying C to I and D results in D..... 
 
This means that applying the function application combinator (C) to the identity combinator 
(I) and the Mockingbird combinator (D) results in the Mockingbird combinator (D), which 
represents the number 2 in this system. 
 
the statement "1 + 1 = 2" being represented as "C I D = D", in combinatory logic can be 
considered an example of an emergent property. 
so 1+1 = 2 where 2 (even) is emergent in regard to 1 (odd)
