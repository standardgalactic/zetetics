Abstract: With the rapid advancement of urbanization, the sustainable development of the city has
received more and more attention. The measurement of the sustainable development of a city can
provide an important reference for the development of the city. Therefore, this paper ﬁrstly constructs
an index system for ﬁve dimensions: society, the economy, the environment, resources, and technology.
Then, a sustainable development measurement model is established based on dissipative structure
theory, grey entropy and coupling theory, and the evolution trend and coordinated development of
the city are measured. Finally, Chengdu, an important central city in the western region of China,
is selected for sustainable development measurement research, from which it was found that the
city became more sustainable and more orderly, the development level was constantly improving,
and the coordination was continuously improving, which was consistent with the actual situation and
indicated that the proposed measurement model could effectively measure and evaluate sustainable
urban development.

1. Introduction
The world urbanization growth rate is expected to reach 60% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 [1],
and the increasing urbanization growth rate has caused more and more residents to enter the city.
As urban areas have grown, cities have become centers for social and economic development and
the driving forces behind sustainable development efforts [2]. As urban changes inevitably affect a
city’s level of social development, economic growth, environmental change, resource consumption,
and technological progress speed [3], it is a huge challenge to meet the needs of the current urban
populations without compromising the needs of future generations [4]. Therefore, there has been
increasing research focused on sustainable urban development. However, as sustainable urban
development is a complex multi-dimensional system that has both external system and internal
subsystem interactions [5], evaluating sustainable urban development is complex.
To promote
sustainable urban system development, it is necessary to assess the sustainability of existing practices,
measure sustainable urban development system evolution, and analyze the impact mechanisms to
ensure efﬁcient, coordinated and orderly overall development.
As sustainable urban development assessments require a comprehensive, accurate approach
and a scientiﬁc, rational index system, there has been signiﬁcant academic research focused on index
system construction and evaluation methods.

Due to different domestic and foreign situations and the differences in urban development levels,
the construction of the sustainable urban development measurement indexes for measurement index
systems has varied signiﬁcantly. However, in general, urban sustainability has been based around
the three dimensions of the economy, society, and the environment [6,7]. Mori et al. [8] established
an index system to analyze the sustainability of these three systems and explored whether they
were able to achieve simultaneous sustainability, and Ghalib et al. [9] developed indexes for these
three systems based on second-hand data collected from 2004 to 2014 to establish a reasonable index
system to evaluate the sustainable urban development in Lahore, Rawalpindi. As research deepened,
there have been attempts to develop a more comprehensive evaluation index system. For example,
Tanguay et al. [10] and Zheng et al. [11] examined the overlaps between the three different systems
and divided sustainable development into seven dimensions: social, economic, environmental, livable
(intersection of environmental and social dimensions), fairness (intersection of economic and social
dimensions), feasibility (intersection of environmental and economic dimensions), and sustainability
(intersection of social, economic, and environmental dimensions).
Li et al. [12] introduced a
measure for human well-being to improve the traditional sustainable three-dimensional index system,
and Wu et al. [13] and Jiang et al. [14] developed an sustainable urban development capability
index assessment systems with ﬁve dimensions—resource security, social development, ecological
environment, economic efﬁciency, and innovation—which was found to more comprehensively reﬂect
the main issues in sustainable urban development.
Various sustainable urban development measurement methods have also been developed.
The most frequently used methods have been comprehensive index evaluations and multivariate
statistical analyses, with some research having used supervisory assignment qualitative analyses and
analytic hierarchy processes such as factor analysis [15,16], the analytic hierarchy process [17], principal
component analysis methods [18], and the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach [19,20].
However, as these methods tend to have strong subjectivity, this can inﬂuence the scientiﬁc rationality
of the research results. When using comprehensive index evaluation and multivariate statistical
methods to study the status of sustainable urban development, most research has been conﬁned to
macro-level analyses and discussion, with few studies having also considered the internal mechanisms
or evolutionary trends. However, providing a comprehensive, accurate reﬂection of a city’s sustainable
development system requires an assessment of the sustainable coordination of the society, the economy,
the environment, resources, and technology as well as the respective interactions between these
subsystems and the external environment.
Qiao et al. [21] developed an improved entropy method to quantitatively analyze the sustainable
development capability in Henan Province, China and assess the importance of the various system
components. Liang et al. [22], based on principal component analysis (PCA) and grey TOPSIS
(Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), constructed a sustainable urban
development capability measurement model which is a convenient and comprehensive measure
of the sustainability of cities in Jiangsu Province.
William et al. [23] used data envelopment
analysis to estimate and assess the environmental, social, and economic efﬁciencies of Colombian
cities to determine the changes that had occurred between 2005 and 2013, which revealed
that there were signiﬁcant differences between the cities, effective urban resource utilization,
small environmental impacts, improving social conditions, and guaranteed economic growth and
development. Guo et al. [24] objectively analyzed the sustainable development capabilities of cities
with the view to establishing a DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis)-based index system. After the
construction of a sustainable index system, Munier [25] proposed a methodology based on information
entropy to assess urban sustainable development. While the information entropy calculation method
in dissipative structure theory is easy to operate, it is often difﬁcult to apply to social sciences [26].
While grey relational analysis can be used to calculate the average value of associated measures point
by point and to assess the degree of relevance, it has two shortcomings: (1) local point association
tendency—when the point-related measure value distribution is discrete, the point at which the

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293
3 of 19
point-correlated measure value is largest determines the tendency of the overall correlation accuracy;
and (2) information loss—the average tends to overwhelm the many point-related measures and
therefore does not take advantage of the rich information provided by the point-related measures [27].
Therefore, to overcome these problems, this paper uses grey relational entropy analysis to
scientiﬁcally and objectively weight the sustainable urban development measurement indexes,
dissipative structure theory to deeply explore and analyze the evolutionary sustainable urban
development system trends and coupling theory to analyze the internal subsystem coordination.
To empirically test the effectiveness of the assessment system, it is then applied to a comprehensive
analysis of Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. Therefore, this paper develops a valuable reference for
related research into sustainable urban development. The innovations in this article are as follows:
(1)
A sustainable urban development measurement analysis based on systems theory is developed.
The sustainable urban development system has ﬁve subsystems:
society, the economy,
the environment, resources and technology. The measurement index system for each subsystem
is constructed based on the actual urban development situation, and the principles of quantity,
totality, purposiveness, systematicity, and scientiﬁcity, the weights for the overall development
level score and each subsystem development level score are determined based on the grey
correlation coefﬁcient calculated using the grey relational analysis method, and the index weights
are calculated using grey entropy;
(2)
Information entropy theory and the grey relational analysis method are combined to analyze
the sustainable urban development system, and system entropy change is used to analyze the
structure and order of the internal system index mechanism and assess the evolution in the
sustainable urban development system;
(3)
Sustainable urban development system evolutionary analysis is conducted based on the annual
grey entropy change, the system development level, the coordination scores, a time series analysis
of the orderly evolutionary trends, and the development level and coordination status.
2. Structural Characteristics of the Sustainable Urban Development System
2.1. Dissipative Characteristics of the Sustainable Urban Development System
Prigogine [28] proposed dissipative structure theory in 1973 to reﬂect a nonlinear open system
far from an equilibrium state that continuously exchanges matter and energy with the external
environment. When the system conditions change to a certain threshold, the system transforms
from the previous disordered state to a new state that is temporally, spatially, and functionally
more ordered, and which also needs to constantly exchange materials or energy with the outside
world to maintain its structure. The sustainable urban development system is an open composite
system with ﬁve subsystems—society, the economy, technology, the environment, and resources—the
mechanism for which is shown in Figure 1. Sustainable urban development systems have the following
characteristics: openness, non-equilibrium, non-linear effects, and ﬂuctuations between the system
elements. Therefore, dissipative structure theory is suitable for the analysis of sustainable urban
development and evolution.
2.1.1. Sustainable Urban Development System Dissipative Characteristics
The sustainable urban development system must be open to maintain orderly evolution and
ensure system survival and development.
During system evolution, the subsystems develop
interactively in terms of the transfers and transformations in the ﬂow of people, logistics, energy,
information, and technology, and therefore are mutually dependent and mutually restrained. At the
same time, the overall system continues to expand its connections with external systems based on
development needs to ensure positive continuous external system input that assists the system moving
towards a new, more orderly structure. Because the system also continues to actively affect the external
environment, it needs to constantly adapt to external environmental changes. Through selective input

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293
4 of 19
and output, the sustainable urban development system continually introduces negative entropy to
offset the entropy increases caused by the internal interactions generated by the external environment
interactions, thereby achieving sustainable development.
Figure 1. Dissipative structure for the sustainable urban development system.
2.1.2. A System Far from Equilibrium
As sustainable urban development is a dynamic evolutionary process, the system needs to
go through an initial-stage, a growth-stage, and a mature-stage life cycle. Therefore, the original
equilibrium system state is being continuously disrupted because of the internal and external
interactions, which drives it towards a higher development level. Further, as the various sustainable
urban development subsystems have imbalances between resource, information and technical forces
due to interest conﬂicts and are also dealing with external environmental inﬂuences, they are unable
to maintain an equilibrium state; therefore, a more orderly structure develops from this unbalanced
dynamic interactivity.
2.1.3. System Nonlinearity
As the sustainable urban development system has several subsystems, the subsystem
development models are different and the development levels imbalanced. When the external
environment interactions on the sustainable urban development system move it away from the
equilibrium state to a certain state, the internal subsystems function normally. However, when the
functions in each subsystem are less than the total system functions, the sustainable urban development
system enters a non-linear region of the non-equilibrium state. While at any moment, the relationship
between the system and the external environment is simply linear, there are nonlinear relationships
because of the organic interactions, the positive feedback multiplication effects, and the negative
feedback saturation effects.

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293

2.1.4. System Fluctuations
During system development and evolution, the elements in each subsystem (ﬁnance, technology,
talent, knowledge, etc.) are continually changing in quantity and quality, which results in random
“ﬂuctuations”. Because of these constant ﬂuctuations in the system, when the impact reaches a
certain level, the system begins to mutate because of the constant self-organization and catalysis and
autocatalysis. The system revolves around its development goals by recombining its resources and
elements, which causes a new “ﬂuctuation”, and moves the system from its previous state to a more
orderly state and into a new dissipative structure.
2.2. Grey Characteristics of Sustainable Urban Development Systems
Cities are complex, open, giant composite systems, and for this paper, cities are made up of ﬁve
subsystems—society, the economy, the environment, resources, and technology—therefore, due to the
diversity, complexity and variability in the social, economic, environmental, resource and technical
conditions and the limitations of human understanding and mastery of the evolutionary laws of these
systems, there are a large number of objective uncertainties and inaccuracies, each of which have both
a certain fuzzy feature and a certain grey feature. Therefore, sustainable urban development systems
are also fuzzy grey systems.
3. Index System Construction
The main factors leading to entropy increases in the dissipative sustainable urban development
system structure are resource consumption and environmental damage, and the main factors leading
to entropy reduction are ﬁnancial support, technological upgrading, and environmental governance.
Entropy increase is a spontaneous process that goes from order to disorder, and entropy reduction
promotes the development of a new, ordered system state because of the negative entropy ﬂow.
To study the entropy increase and entropy reduction factors in the sustainable urban development
system, the negative entropy ﬂow is selectively introduced to promote more orderly and coordinated
system development.
When constructing the index system, this paper strictly followed the principles of quantity, totality,
purposiveness, systematicity, and scientiﬁcity [29,30] and drew upon existing achievements and the
actual situation in developed cities to identify the main factors affecting the dissipative sustainable
urban development system structure. Then, a measurement evaluation index system based on a
socio-economic–environmental–resource–technological (SEERT) framework for the sustainable urban
development system was established which is shown in Table 1.

4. Method for Measuring the Sustainable Urban Development System
4.1. Measurement Model
The sustainable urban development system is a composite system with several subsystems, each of
which has its own development and evolutionary rules and constraints; therefore, the sustainable urban
development system structure embodies complex mutual connections, mutual restraints, and mutual
support relationships, all of which affect the system’s operating mechanisms and evolution.
Orderly social, economic, environmental, resource and technological sustainable development can
be achieved if these subsystems are able to maintain a certain order and a dynamic coordinated balance,
which would eventually result in benign development, circulation, and evolution in the sustainable
urban development system. However, achieving a dynamic but orderly evolution from a low-ordered
state to a new high-ordered state is not certain as both orderly and disorderly transformations are
possible. Therefore, when studying the system evolution, it is ﬁrst necessary to describe the order of
the system.
When quantitatively and scientiﬁcally analyzing the status of the sustainable urban development
system based on dissipative structure theory, the grey relational analysis method and the information
entropy weight method can be used to calculate the grey entropy of the index and the year-end
information. The grey information entropy of the index information can then be used to determine
the index weights for the calculation of the system development level score and the coordination
development level score, both of which provide an effective, reasonable evaluation of the sustainable
urban development system. Using the grey entropy year-end information, the evolutionary trends
and order degree for the sustainable urban development system can be assessed from the time series.
The measurement model used in this paper is shown in Figure 2.
 
Figure 2. Measure model.
4.2. Measurement Steps
4.2.1. Build the Initial Matrix
This paper studies the sustainable development of a city in m years, which has n indexes in the
evaluation index system, the mathematical model for which was built as follows:
The domain is U = {u1, u2, . . . , ui}, i = 1, 2, . . . , m;
The number of indexes for each ui is characterized by ui =

xi1, xi2, . . . , xij
	
, j = 1, 2, . . . , n;
In this way, the initial measurement data matrix is obtained as X =

xij
	
m×n, where xij represents
the value of the jth evaluation index in year i. As there are dimensional and order-of-magnitude
differences between each index in the initial data matrix, the next step is to standardize the data.

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293
8 of 19
4.2.2. Data Standardization
To ensure the reliability of the measurement results, this paper uses the extremum method to
perform dimensionless processing and eliminate the inﬂuences of the different dimensions and order
of magnitude on the initial data. The entropy increase and entropy decrease indexes in the evaluation
index dimensions were respectively eliminated using the maximum and minimum values.
For the entropy reduction index xij, the larger the value, the better:
x′
ij =
xij
max

x1j, x2j, . . . , xij
	, i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n
(1)
For the entropy increase index xij, the smaller the value, the better:
x′
ij = min

x1j, x2j, . . . , xij
	
xij
, i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n
(2)
Then, the normalized value is yij = x′
ij.
Thus, the standardized matrix is obtained as y =

yij
	
m×n.
4.2.3. Grey Correlation Analysis
First, determine the comparison sequences and the reference sequences.
The comparison sequence is yi =

y1j, y2j, . . . , yij
	
, i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The reference sequence consists of the optimal index values. As the dimensionless indexes now
belong to the interval [0, 1], the maximum value for each index is selected as the comparison sequence
y0 = {1, 1, . . . 1}.
Next, calculate the correlation coefﬁcient, and the grey correlation coefﬁcient indicates
ζij =
min

yij −1

, i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n
(3)
where ρ is the resolution coefﬁcient, ρ ∈[0, 1], and ρ = 0.5 to achieve a higher resolution.
4.2.4. Calculating the Grey Entropy Value and Grey Entropy Weight
As the information entropy in the information system is a measure of the degree of information
disorder, the information entropy can be used to evaluate the order degree and the utility value of the
obtained system information. The larger the information entropy, the higher the information disorder,
and the smaller the information utility value, the smaller the weight. On the contrary, the smaller
the information entropy, the lower the information disorder, and the greater the information utility
value, the greater the weight. The entropy method can accurately determine the utility value of the
index information entropy value and allow for the construction of a judgment matrix by evaluating the
index numerical values to determine the index weights. Therefore, as the entropy method eliminates
evaluator subjectivity and objectively determines the indexes based on survey data, the results are
more in line with reality.
From the information entropy deﬁnition, the information entropy value of the jth index is
Ej = −K
m
∑
i=1
pij ln pij, j = 1, 2, . . . , n
(4)
where pij =
ζij
ζj =
ζij
∑m
i=1jj , j = 1, 2, . . . , n. K is a constant, and the value is related to the number of system
samples., When the system information is completely disordered, the order degree is 0, the entropy

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293
9 of 19
value is the largest, and E = 1. When there are m samples in a completely disordered state, pij = 1
m,
at this time, K =
1
ln m, 0 ≤E ≤1 [36–38].
Based on Shannon’s information entropy deﬁnition and the Boltzmann function, the difference
coefﬁcient for the jth evaluation index entropy under the ith subsystem can be calculated [39].
dj = 1 −Ej, j = 1, 2, . . . , n
(5)
The weight coefﬁcient of the index information is used to calculate the weight of each index;
therefore, the entropy weight of the jth index is
wj =
dj
∑n
j=1 dj
, j = 1, 2, . . . , n
(6)
The system’s sustainable development level score and the system’s coordination degree are used
to analyze the coordinated development of the sustainable urban development system. As the
measurement system has a multi-layer structure, according to the information entropy weight
additivity, the entropy weight for each subsystem is calculated as
Wk =
l
∑
j=1
wj
(7)
where k is the number of subsystems in the system, and l is the number of measurement indexes for
the subsystem.
The weight of the measurement indexes of the subsystem is calculated as
Wj = wj
Wk
(8)
4.2.5. Calculating the Year Entropy Changes Using Grey Correlation
This paper reﬂects the orderly system development degree and evolutionary trends using the
year-end entropy changes in the sustainable urban development system. The year-end entropy change
is calculated for each year’s sequence [40], the formula for which is
dSi = K
n
∑
j=1
qij ln qij, i = 1, 2, . . . , m
(9)
where qij =
ζij
ζi =
ζij
∑n
j=1 ζij , i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
4.2.6. Coordinated Development Level
Based on the entropy weight for each index Wj and wj, and the grey correlation coefﬁcient,
the system development level score D and each subsystem development level score Dk are calculated.
Dik =
n
∑
j=1
wjζij, i = 1, 2, . . . , m
(10)
Di =
n
∑
j=1
wjζij, i = 1, 2, . . . , m
(11)
The coordinated development of each system is expressed by the coupling degree, which is the
degree to which the system and the system elements are mutually consistent in the development
process and the orderly system development trend. The coupling degree [41], derived from physics,

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293
10 of 19
refers to the phenomenon when two or more systems interact through various forms of motion.
The coupling degree is used to measure the interaction degree between systems or elements, while the
degree of coordination is the relationship of the coordination and virtuous cycle between systems or
elements. The coupling degree formula is as follows:
Ci =


∏5
k=1 Dik

∑5
k=1 Dik
5
5


1/5
, i = 1, 2, . . . , m
(12)
The larger the Ci, the higher the coordination degree of each subsystem in the year. When Ci = 1,
the three systems have reached the optimum coordination state; however, when Ci = 0, the various
elements within the system are totally uncoordinated and the system is disorderly.
However, when the coupling degree is simply used to judge the interaction relationship
between the various subsystems in the sustainable urban development system, it can result in
pseudo-coordination and low subsystem development but a high coupling degree [42], which does
not truly reﬂect the comprehensive development level of the society, the economy, technology,
the environment and resource. Therefore, the coordinated development model is as follows:
CDi =
p
Ci × Di, i = 1, 2, . . . , m
(13)
where Di is the total system development level score.
Referring to study [43], the classiﬁcation for the coordinated development is shown in the
following Table 2.

5. Case Study
5.1. Research Area
Considering that the earthquake in Sichuan in 2008, we selected the data from 2009 to 2016
for analysis to ensure that the time span is long enough.
Based on the requirements of our
index system, the original data used for this case were extracted from the China city statistical
yearbooks (2010~2017) [31], Chengdu yearbooks (2010~2017) [32], Sichuan statistical yearbooks
(2010~2017) [33], Chengdu statistical yearbooks (2010~2017) [34], China Intellectual Property Statistics
Report (2010~2017) [35]. Relevant data were extracted to obtain the index data, with the small number
of missing values being processed through interpolation.
Using Formulas (1)–(8) on the original data, the grey entropy and entropy weights for each index
in Chengdu’s sustainable development system were calculated, which were then used to calculate the
system coordination and development levels. The data are shown in Table 3.

5.2. Results Analysis
5.2.1. Analysis of the Orderly Degree and Evolution Trend of Sustainable Development in Chengdu
Using the proposed method and the grey entropy changes each year, the evolutionary trend
and orderly development degree of the sustainable urban development system in Chengdu was
determined. Figure 3; Figure 4 show the evolutionary trend and order degree for each subsystem and
the overall system. As can be seen in Figure 3, the entropy in each subsystem from 2009 to 2015 was
reducing at varying degrees, indicating that Chengdu’s social, economic, environmental, resource,
and technological subsystems were developing in an orderly direction. The entropy deceleration in
the resource subsystem was slowing and the entropy deceleration in the environmental subsystem
was increasing, which indicated that the government policy measures had had signiﬁcant success in
improving the Chengdu environment. It can be seen that the improvement of Chengdu’s sustainable
development capacity is greatly affected by policy factors, such as the state’s strong ecological
environmental protection supervision, the establishment of independent innovation pilot zones and

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293
12 of 19
national central cities, etc. However, the impact of industrial structure, technological structure transfer
and transformation factors is relatively small.
From Figure 4, it can be clearly seen that from 2009 to 2016, the entropy of the overall
sustainable urban development system in Chengdu was gradually decreasing, with the rate of decline
ﬂattening out from 2014 to 2016, which indicated that through continuous development and evolution,
the sustainable urban development system in Chengdu was becoming more orderly, with the whole
system moving towards a state of dynamic balance. It can be seen that from the 12th to the 15th that
Chengdu’s development and construction has achieved great results, providing favorable support for
the 13th Five-Year Plan to build the western economic center, the beautiful Chinese model city, and the
happy city.

5.2.2. Analysis of the Development Status of the Sustainable Urban Development System in Chengdu
(1)
Total system sustainability analysis
It can be seen from Figure 5; Figure 6 that from 2009–2016, the sustainable urban development
system in Chengdu was evolving towards high-quality coordination, from a moderate coordination
of 0.7100 to a quality coordination of 0.9701. The comprehensive sustainable development score also
had a gradual upward trend from 0.5124 in 2009 to 0.9422 in 2016, an average annual growth rate of
5.37%. This was mainly because the government began to focus more attention on environmental
protection and technology, therefore introducing a series of policies and increasing investment such as
conducting environmental inspections, establishing national-level science and technology research and
development centers, etc., which led to a rapid development in the environmental and technological
subsystems, especially from 2015 to 2016, at which time the growth rate in the environmental subsystem
score was 41.05%. From 2014 to 2016, the growth rate in the technology subsystem score was 16.60%.
Therefore, as can be seen, Chengdu’s urban development was becoming more coordinated and
more sustainable.

Social subsystem sustainable development level
From Figure 7, it can be seen that the social subsystem sustainable development level continuously
increased from 0.5002 to 0.9468, an average annual growth rate of 5.58%. In 2016, the social consumer
goods retail sales reached 574.236 million CNY, the average employee wages reached 74,408 yuan,
the year-end balance of urban and rural resident savings reached 108.08 billion CNY, and the level
of urban infrastructure also gradually improved. This is due to the Chengdu government’s focus on
comprehensively improving people’s well-being, raising the income level of residents and increasing
investment in infrastructure. The quality of life was improving, which boosted consumption power,
and lay the foundation for further social subsystem development.

Economic subsystem sustainable development level
From Figure 8, it can be seen that the economic subsystem development level was generally
improving; however, there were varying degrees of decline during the assessment period. In 2012 and
2014, the system development level ﬂuctuated, mainly because of a decrease in the GDP growth rate
and the ﬁscal general public income in 2012, which resulted in lower economic vitality and a lower
economic subsystem development level. However, since the 13th Five-Year Plan, Chengdu has focused
on industrial restructuring and industrial transformation and upgrading. In 2016, the proportion
of tertiary industry reached 53.11%, and the per-capita GDP reached 76,960 CNY, resulting in the
continuous improvement of the economic subsystem development level. In addition, with the
implementation of a series of national strategies such as the Chengdu–Chongqing city group and
national central city, the government has increased investment in ﬁxed assets and made efforts to
build a western economic center, which has played a very important role in its economic development.
It can be seen that the trend line has become more inclined from 2015 to 2016, indicating that the
economic growth rate has increased, and the overall economic subsystem development level was
gradually increasing.

Environmental subsystem sustainable development level
From Figure 9, it can be seen that the environmental subsystem grew steadily from 2009 to 2015,
and grew rapidly from 2015 to 2016, with a growth rate of 41.05%. Since the “13th Five-Year Plan”,
Chengdu has been promoting the construction and development of energy-saving and environmental
protection industries, such as equipment manufacturing, and has focused on efﬁcient resource use,
energy-conservation and environmental protection services, and the construction of a “one main,
three auxiliaries” industrial layout. These measures have resulted in a reduction in waste and emissions.
From 2015 to 2016, the per-capita industrial wastewater discharge, per-capita sulfur dioxide emissions,
per-capita soot emissions, and environmental expenditure rate increases were respectively 36.72%,
54.20%, 48.32%, and 31.60%, all of which are key to sustainable urban environmental development.

Resource subsystem sustainable development level
From Figure 10, it can be seen that the resource subsystem development speed was relatively slow,
primarily because the per-capita water electricity and gas use was increasing, which accelerated
the resource consumption and reduced the resource sub system sustainable development level.
In recent years, Chengdu has been accelerating industrial transformation and upgrades, deepening
the elimination of backwardness and defusing excess capacity, accelerating the development of green
and low-carbon industries, and strictly controlling the growth of high-energy-consuming industries,
which plays an important role in reducing the energy consumption per unit of GDP. From 2014 to 2016,
the energy consumption per unit of GDP(t/10ˆ4 CNY) was reduced from 0.840 to 0.456, and the unit
industrial added value energy consumption(t/10ˆ4 CNY) was reduced from 1.385 to 0.826, which has
promoted the development of the resource subsystem to a certain extent.

development level from 2009 to 2014 was 3.45%, after which the growth increased signiﬁcantly from
2014 to 2016 at an average annual growth rate of 16.60%. Through the strengthening of policy support
and the provision of increased ﬁnancial assistance, Chengdu has gradually strengthened its scientiﬁc
and technological development level and achieved remarkable results. From 2014 to 2016, the average
annual growth rate in the number of invention patent grants in Chengdu was 23.43%, and the
average growth rate for the output technological development was 23.27%. These results indicate that
the strategic government science and technology measures have been promoting sustainable urban
technological subsystem development.

6. Conclusions and Prospects
This paper constructed a sustainable urban development measurement index based on the
dissipative structure and grey relational entropy theories that included indexes in the ﬁve dimensions
of the society, the economy, the environment, resources, and technology to conduct a quantitative
measurement analysis of the sustainable development level, the coordinated development level,
the evolutionary trends and the sustainable urban development system order. Using the developed
index, the sustainable urban development in Chengdu was assessed from 2009 to 2016, from which the
following conclusions were drawn.
The sustainable urban development system is a complex, giant system with ﬁve subsystems;
the society, the economy, the environment, resources and technology.
There are material-ﬂow,
information-ﬂow and energy-ﬂow interactions between the subsystems and between the total system
and the external environment. As the evolutionary system direction is uncertain but has structural
dissipative and grey features, dissipative structure theory and grey theory can be used to analyze the
evolution in sustainable urban development systems.
Grey entropy theory was shown to effectively analyze the sustainable urban development system
evolution, as the grey entropy in each year can indicate the evolutionary trends and system order
degree, with a fall in the entropy value indicating system order enhancement and a movement towards
benign evolution. Therefore, when assessing sustainable urban development system development
trends, grey entropy was proven to be useful as the quantitative index. Further, the indexes have strong
objectivity when weighted using the grey relational analysis method and the entropy weight method.
To effectively analyze the sustainable urban development system coordination, coupling theory
was shown to be a good method. The coordinated development level analysis found that this method
was able to accurately assess the degrees of consistency between the sustainable urban development
system and the ﬁve subsystems.
The developed multi-dimensional and multi-faceted comprehensive analysis method was able
to provide a valuable reference for sustainable urban development as it was able to assess the
overall system development trends, identify the dynamics in the various subsystems, and promote
all-round development.
This study, however, had certain limitations. While sustainability, coordination, and fairness
are the three core sustainable development concepts, when establishing indexes, it is necessary to
consider the multiple levels and aspects; however, for some indexes in this study, such as policy

Sustainability 2019, 11, 293

factors, there was insufﬁcient information available on their effect on overall sustainable development.
Therefore, in the future, these need to be further explored.
