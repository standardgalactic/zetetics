On Wittgenstein’s so-called Metaphilosophy 
Conrad Baetzel  
Bonn, Germany | C.Baetzel@uni-bonn.de 
Abstract 
The topic of this paper is the recent attempt by Paul Horwich to extract “Wittgenstein’s metaphilosophy” from the Investigations, 
and the debate between Horwich and Timothy Williamson about the prospects of the resulting “Wittgensteinian” account. I 
consider first Horwich’s project and raise some worries about it; second Williamson’s objection against Horwich; before I then 
argue that, although I take Horwich’s project to be both incorrect about the insights of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and 
philosophically flawed, it is nevertheless an interesting project to adhere to Wittgenstein’s insights into the nature and task of 
philosophy—something that Horwich aims to do but fails to achieve. In this way, the shortcomings of Horwich’s account can be 
a helpful stimulation towards, on the one hand, a better understanding of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, and, on the other, an 
account of philosophy that is interesting and valuable on its own, independently of exegetical concerns in Wittgensteinian 
scholarship. 
 
 
1. Horwich’s account 
In his recent book Wittgenstein’s Metaphilosophy, Paul 
Horwich does not strive to engage in Wittgensteinian 
scholarship. Nevertheless, Horwich’s aim is to present a 
“Wittgensteinian” metaphilosophical framework—an ac-
count of the “true nature of philosophy” (Horwich 2012: vii). 
And furthermore, another one of Horwich’s goals (though a 
subsidiary one) is to move Wittgenstein back in the lime-
light of “mainstream” analytic philosophy. As Horwich 
writes: 
[M]y own primary concern is philosophy rather than 
scholarship. I do think that the ideas that will follow can 
be extracted […] from Wittgenstein’s text […]. But my 
main contention is that, regardless of their pedigree, 
they are worth taking seriously. My hope for this project 
is that it might help to restore Wittgenstein’s unique 
perspective to the mainstream of analytic philosophy 
(Horwich 2012: xii-xiii). 
I agree with Horwich that Wittgenstein’s ideas are “worth 
taking seriously”, and I also agree that it is a fascinating 
project “to restore Wittgenstein’s unique perspective”. I am 
skeptical, however, how all this is supposed to work with-
out engaging in Wittgensteinian scholarship, and I worry 
that Horwich’s “Wittgensteinian” account attempts to buy 
Wittgenstein’s authority on the cheap. Thus I do not agree 
with Horwich’s all too easy dismissal of Wittgensteinian 
scholarship, especially on the “basis” that Horwich gives 
for the dismissal. Horwich’s negative assessment of Witt-
gensteinian scholarship features in this passage: 
[T]here has been a polar split between, on the one 
hand, the great majority of philosophers, who don’t 
think that his [Wittgenstein’s] ideas are relevant to their 
work, and, on the other hand, the Wittgensteinians 
themselves, who are engaged in feuds with one an-
other that no one else cares about. It would be good if 
this ghettoization could be done away with (Horwich 
2012: xiii). 
Horwich’s unhappy choice of language taken aside, there 
still remains the deeper worry that, if the picture that Hor-
wich suggests here would be correct, it seems that it would 
amount to a wholesale argument against any of the highly 
specialized philosophical scholarships and branches into 
which contemporary academic philosophy is divided. Fur-
thermore, it seems that the structure of Horwich’s “argu-
ment” would even generalize to other branches of acade-
mia. Since if the fact that the majority of controversies are 
fought out by highly specialized experts in any field of in-
quiry, it seems that the fact that “no one else cares about” 
could be repeated to dismiss these controversies. But I 
think it is fair to say that to claim that “no one else cares 
about” some controversial scholarly issue is not a good 
ground for dismissing the scholarship in the first place. 
Therefore I do not think that Horwich has given any good 
reason, which would discredit the efforts of Wittgensteinian 
scholarship, and, furthermore, I do not see that Horwich 
has given any reason that would justify his lack of en-
gagement with Wittgensteinian scholarship. 
I nevertheless want to capture from this discussion of 
Horwich’s aim that there is a need to bring back and make 
accessible Wittgenstein’s “unique perspective”—the ideas 
and insights to be acquired in engagement with Wittgen-
stein’s writings. But to work out what this amounts to does 
not come on the cheap, without learning about the practice 
of philosophy that Wittgenstein aspires, as Horwich sug-
gests. And learning about this practice of philosophy, pace 
Horwich, does not come without engaging in Wittgen-
steinian scholarship. 
Take as an example the “most important insight” which 
Horwich finds in Wittgenstein, the well-known remark that 
“Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our in-
telligence by means of language” (Horwich 2012: 1; Witt-
genstein 1999: §109). This is a very popular remark, to say 
the least. It is frequently quoted by philosophers which are, 
broadly speaking, working after the so-called “linguistic 
turn”, and it is also often quoted by Wittgensteinian schol-
ars. It is fair to say that generations of Wittgensteinian 
scholars have already struggled with the question what 
this remark implies for the current and future practice of 
philosophy. It is hard to understand why the “high stan-
dards of constructive critical scrutiny” (Horwich 2012: xiv), 
which Horwich finds current work in analytic philosophy to 
be subject to, would not demand to at least attempt to 
catch up with the discussion of this remark in Wittgen-
steinian scholarship. It is not enough to say that “no one 
else cares about” these discussions. If one were to employ 
the “high standards” of scrutiny, one would, at a minimum, 
have to take into account the work that has already been 
done on the remark that Horwich quotes, at the very least 
to be aware of, and avoid, the mistakes that have already 
been made in the interpretation of the remark. To say that 
Wittgensteinians are only engaged in meaningless “feuds” 
is just a superficial estimate. And since Horwich has not 
even attempted to gain a position that would allow him to 
judge the current status of Wittgensteinian scholarship,

what this shows is that Horwich can only assume that 
Wittgensteinian scholars fail to violate the “high standards” 
he requires philosophical writing to have. And what this 
further, and more pressingly, shows is that Horwich himself 
fails to meet his own much appreciated “high standards” of 
non-Wittgensteinian scholarship, because any such stan-
dard would clearly require to engage with the scholars of 
the topic one is interested in. Thus the watered-down Witt-
gensteinian back-up for Horwich’s account seems to be 
based on dubitable grounds. 
This is confirmed once the main parts of Horwich’s ac-
count are considered, that is, Horwich’s deflationary view 
of truth, the identification of meaning with use, and a re-
ductive-behavioral understanding of consciousness. The 
structure of Horwich’s main argumentative line is that the 
parts of his philosophical account directly follow from the 
metaphilosophical account he finds in Wittgenstein. Thus 
Horwich’s rendering of the alleged Wittgensteinian 
metaphilosophical account has as its ultimate goal to entail 
and justify Horwich’s own philosophical account. But it is 
puzzling that, in Horwich’s rendering, Wittgenstein’s 
metaphilosophy rather nicely seems to entail Horwich’s 
account. If there would be striking and uncontroversial tex-
tual evidence in Wittgenstein’s writings for both the 
metaphilosophical and philosophical account, and the en-
tailment of the latter by the former, Wittgenstein’s alleged 
metaphilosophical sanctioning of Horwich’s philosophical 
account would not be surprising. But the little to no evi-
dence that is actually presented makes it highly unlikely 
that Wittgenstein’s writings can convey much of authority 
for Horwich’s account. This suggests that to take Horwich’s 
account on Wittgenstein’s authority is a leap of faith, and 
once Wittgenstein’s alleged metaphilosophical back-up is 
wiped of the scene, what Horwich is left with are the usual 
and common objections to his philosophical account. 
Thus, this discussion is evidence that Horwich’s philoso-
phical account lacks justification (at least from “Wittgen-
stein’s” metaphilosophy), and the question if Horwich’s 
account is valid reduces to the question if Horwich’s ac-
count is plausible on independent ground. And to seek an 
answer to this I turn to the objection raised by Timothy Wil-
liamson. 
2. Williamson’s objection 
According to Horwich, the picture one is confronted with in 
philosophy is that one has to make a decision between two 
radically opposed views of philosophy. One view is theo-
retical, and the other therapeutical. Horwich calls the first 
of these views “T-philosophy”, which stands for “traditional” 
and “theoretical” philosophy (Horwich 2012: 21, and pas-
sim). Williamson seems to accept both that philosophy is 
divided into these two possibilities and Horwich’s terminol-
ogy. Furthermore, Williamson accepts to identify himself 
with, and as a proponent of, T-philosophy. I propose, for 
the purposes of the point this paper aims to push, a slight 
amendment to this terminology. In what follows, I will dis-
tinguish between T1-philosophy (for traditional-theoretical 
philosophy, i.e. Williamson’s position) and T2-philosophy 
(for therapeutical, i.e. Horwich’s position). 
Now in his review of Horwich’s book, Williamson’s main 
objection is that Horwich’s argument that T1-philosophy is 
irrational fails (Williamson 2013). The crux of Williamson’s 
argument is that, pace Horwich, T2-philosophy is not obvi-
ous, but (i) lacks the high standards of T1-philosophy, and 
(ii) exhibit the same (flawed) features of T1-philosophy 
which T2-philosophy criticizes; thus, T2-philosophy cannot 
establish that T1-philosophy is irrational. I agree with Wil-
liamson that Horwich’s account suffers from these defects. 
Williamson’s discussion of Horwich is also interesting 
because 
Williamson 
himself 
has 
a 
well-developed 
metaphilosophical account. Therefore, Williamson has high 
stakes in the question about the merits or shortcomings of 
Horwich’s metaphilosophical account. In fact, Williamson’s 
objection to Horwich is part of a much larger debate be-
tween Horwich and Williamson that developed through a 
series of books, papers, reviews and replies on the ques-
tion about the nature, progress and method of philosophy 
(Williamson 2007, 2012; Horwich 2011, 2012, 2013). In a 
very compressed form, the difference between Horwich 
and Williamson is that, while Williamson’s view is charac-
terized by a striking optimism about the progress that most 
recent analytic, formal and theoretical philosophy has 
made on questions about truth, meaning, and knowledge, 
Horwich’s view is instead characterized by a pessimism 
about this progress. Thus, although there is, to a certain 
extent at least, an overlap in the philosophical questions 
that both Williamson and Horwich are interested in answer-
ing, there is a crucial difference in the evaluation of the 
work on these questions. For the last part of this paper, I 
now turn to this striking contrast. 
3. The metaphilosophical fork and the 
dogma of metaphilosophy 
Both Williamson and Horwich are highly influential figures 
in contemporary analytic philosophy. The differences be-
tween them, however, are striking. Put crudely, while Wil-
liamson’s style draws heavily on formal logic, Horwich’s 
style is non-formal. If this suggests one thing, than this is 
that these two philosophers have quite different ap-
proaches, and a comparison of their views will most likely 
exhibit more dissent than assent. 
The core of the debate between Horwich and Williamson 
is about the question whether the aim of philosophy should 
be to engage in philosophical theory building or to engage 
in philosophical therapy. This makes it seem as if one had 
to decide between two rather unhappy alternatives, both 
controversial and unsatisfying: either philosophy is purely 
theoretical, or philosophy is merely therapeutical. I call this 
the metaphilosophical fork. What I want to suggest now is 
that such a fork is itself misleading and needs to be over-
come. 
The controversy between theoretical and therapeutical 
accounts of philosophy, however, is well-known to Witt-
gensteinian scholars. Forgive the irony, if Horwich would 
not have dismissed Wittgensteinian scholarship, he could 
have known better, and he could have noticed the pro-
gress that Wittgensteinian scholarship has made on this 
issue, which I take to be the recognition that the seemingly 
pressure that such a fork might be taken to have turns out 
to be a red herring if strictly thought through, until both 
sides of the fork lose their apparent appeal. 
If Horwich would have engaged in Wittgensteinian 
scholarship, he could also have known how to strictly ad-
here to Wittgenstein’s constant and vehement attempt to 
avoid inflicting his philosophical practice with a dogmatic 
tone. To a certain extent at least, I take it, Horwich’s rebel-
lion against T1-philosophy seems to be one against a cer-
tain form of philosophical dogmatism or impositionism. 
What Horwich reacts to is that T1-philosophy makes it 
seem as if there is just this one correct understanding of 
how to do philosophy, T1-philosophy. But when Horwich 
launches his criticism against T1-philosophy, he himself 
makes it seem as if this shortcoming could be solved if T1-
philosophy would simply be replaced by T2-philosophy. 
But this is a mistake. Because, when Horwich attempts to

make this move, he himself imposes his philosophical 
views on the question what philosophy is. Thus both Wil-
liamson’s T1-philosophy and Horwich’s T2-philosophy are 
restrictive conceptions of philosophy, that is, they restrict 
what can and cannot be done in philosophy, by trying to 
negate each other. What I take Wittgenstein to recom-
mend, in contrast, could be called a non-restrictive concep-
tion of philosophy. A non-restrictive conception of philoso-
phy aims to uncover the limitations of both T1-philosophy 
and T2-philosophy, and hold on to the useful tools and 
insights which they provide. 
What is common between Horwich and Williamson is 
that they are committed to an exclusive metaphilosophy: 
since there are no agreed-on criteria when a given method 
is a “good one”; when given evidence is “conclusive”; or 
when a given philosophical question is “well formed”, it 
seems to be the case that philosophers can arbitrarily 
choose, depending on their preferences, which metaphi-
losophical account is the correct one to be adopted. This 
schema is clearly exhibited by both Horwich and William-
son. I call this the dogma of metaphilosophy. 
If Horwich and Williamson would have complied with the 
“high standards”, which they both praise so much, they 
would have engaged with the highly sophisticated discus-
sions of Wittgenstein’s remarks which is currently exhibited 
by the best commentators in Wittgensteinian scholarship, 
and they could have noticed that the picture of philosophy 
which they draw and accept is based on a completely bi-
ased and dogmatic view of what “good” and “bad” philoso-
phy is, and equally what “progress” in philosophy means. 
Wittgenstein warns against being mislead by the role the 
concept of “progress” plays in other areas of our lives; but 
since allegedly “no one cares”, Wittgenstein’s insights get 
lost in translation, when non-Wittgensteinian scholars at-
tempt to make readily available the alleged grand metaphi-
losophical design which they think Wittgenstein’s later phi-
losophy has. That such a way of doing philosophy is nei-
ther suggested by Wittgenstein’s writings, nor can be in the 
interest of contemporary mainstream philosophy, might 
strike one as superfluous to mention, but Horwich’s ac-
count reminds one that it is nevertheless much-needed to 
be said.

Beyond facts and transcendence: the manifestation of value in 
language. Some thoughts on a wittgensteinian notion of value 
Maria Balaska 
Paris; France | maria.g.balaska@gmail.com   
Abstract 
This article tries to designate a notion of value which allows us to stay in language and avoid the two following perspectives: that 
of the merely factual and that of transcendence. The first perspective amounts to the idea that all there is is facts and no value: 
value in this sense becomes at best a pragmatic concept and gets related to what is merely useful. The perspective of tran-
scendence regards value as emerging from a transcendent source and as involving ineffable truths: value hence becomes a 
concept which belongs to a realm beyond language. How can one equally avoid these two perspectives and find a place for 
value in language? It will be argued that the notion of meaning can be a suitable notion for tracing value in language, insofar as 
meaning is regarded as the recovery of a whole web of relations between propositions that are used significantly. This notion of 
meaning can fit with the idea of “seeing as a whole” which is pivotal in Wittgenstein's notion of ethics and aesthetics. 
 
 
1.Value as an aspect of meaning 
As it was announced, I will try to argue that Wittgenstein 
provides us with a notion of value which is distinguished 
from the factual without however abandoning language, 
through drawing a connection between the realm of value 
and the realm of meaning
1. If meaning bears also an as-
pect of value or significance on it, then maybe it is possible 
to find a place for value in language without however this 
being expressed as some particular propositional content. 
Drawing a relation between value and meaning presup-
poses of course a notion of meaning which is distinct from 
reference, but which is closer to the idea of use, to a re-
covery of possibilities of significant use
2. This is indeed the 
notion of meaning that will be presupposed here, a notion 
involving the taking together of a whole web of proposi-
tional contexts rather than a notion involving some particu-
lar propositional content or a referential relation between a 
name and an object.  
But let me first start with the notion of value. We know 
that in the Tractatus (6.4-6.42), Wittgenstein draws a clear-
cut distinction between facts and value, or in other words 
between propositional contents and value. If value does 
not belong to facts then it cannot be expressed as  pro-
positional content.  
Facts are all valueless, they all stand at the same level, 
so to speak. If facts make up the world, and value is not 
about facts then it is normal to presume that value cannot 
be a part of the world. Also, since propositions are facts 
(which represent facts), there cannot be any propositions 
of ethics, namely there cannot be any propositions ex-
pressing value; such propositions would have to be able to 
express something higher which is impossible given that 
propositions represent (valueless) facts.  
But this does not mean neither that value does not exist, 
nor that there is a realm beyond the world where value is 
placed, since we know already from the preface of the 
                                                      
1 Such a connection is drawn in a thorough and well-examined way by Eli 
Friedlander, see Friedlander, E. Signs of Sense, Reading Wittgenstein's 
Tractatus, Cambridge, Mass. & London, Eng.: Harvard University Press , 
2001. The present paper follows in several respects Friedlander's interpreta-
tion of the Tractatus. 
2 This idea cannot of course be taken for granted, however for reasons of 
space I won't be trying to present an argument for this here (which I have done 
however  in my thesis). There is of course a whole line of  interpretations 
which regard meaning in the Tractatus as use and not as reference. See in-
dicatively  Conant, J. “Wittgenstein on Meaning and Use”, Philosophical Inves-
tigations 21:3 July 1998, as well as Livingston, P. ‘Meaning is Use’ in the Trac-
tatus, Philosophical Investigations 27:1 January 2004) 
Tractatus that the limit can only be drawn in language. If 
value does not lie in a realm beyond language, since we 
are always already situated within language, but is mani-
fested through language, however not as something which 
can be expressed as  propositional content (as fact), then 
what is the place left for it?     
One needs to pay attention to the fact that Wittgenstein 
uses the terms “sense” or “meaning” to designate this as-
pect of value or significance which cannot be articulated as 
some propositional content: in the above-cited propositions 
Wittgenstein speaks of the sense of the world, while in his 
Notebooks
3 he often uses both words (Sinn and Bedeu-
tung) to refer to value or significance
4.   
Wittgenstein's use of the same notions (of the ones he 
uses for language, namely “Sinn” and “Bedeutung”) to in-
dicate an aspect of significance or value, can be explained 
as an effort to highlight that value or the ethical is not an 
extra feature, or an extra domain which is then attached to 
language, but it is rather a dimension of our language it-
self
5.  
But, as we said, ethics cannot be expressed in proposi-
tions, for any proposition represents facts and only facts. It 
is the existence of language itself, Wittgenstein is tempted 
to say (in his Lecture on Ethics), rather than any particular 
proposition, which expresses value. “I will now describe 
the experience of wondering at the existence of the world 
by saying: It is the experience of seeing the world as a 
miracle. Now I am tempted to say that the right expression 
in language for the miracle of the existence of the world, 
though is not a proposition in language, is the existence of 
language itself.”
6   
The alternative then is to think of meaning not in terms of 
some specific meaning, but as involving generality, taking 
something as a whole.  In other words, if meaning is not

Anscombe, eds. G.E.M. Anscombe, trans. Oxford: Blackwell, 1958. Hence-
forth NB. 
4 In the NB he writes that “good and evil are somehow connected with the 
meaning  of the world (Sinn der Welt)”. (NB, p. 73, 11.6.16)  and two entries 
later he links God to the meaning (sinn) of life: “To believe in a God means to 
understand the question about the  meaning of life.  To believe in a God 
means to see that the facts of the world are not the end of the matter. To be-
lieve in God means to see that life has a meaning”. (NB, p.74, 8.7.16.) He also 
uses the words bedeutend-unbedeutend to designate significant-insignificant. 
“As a thing among things, each thing is equally insignificant (unbedeutend); as 
a world each one equally significant (bedeutend). (NB p.83, 8. 10. 16)” 
5 Friedlander also draws our attention to this “sense” which cannot be given 
propositional content. See Friedlander, E. (2001), ibid. p.125

related to some particular propositional contents, then we 
need to understand the recovery of meaning in more holis-
tic terms. Wittgenstein suggests this idea in his Notebooks: 
“As a thing among things, each thing is equally insig-
nificant (unbedeutend); as a world each one equally 
significant (bedeutend). If I have been contemplating 
the stove, and then am told: but now all you know is the 
stove, my result does indeed seem trivial. For this 
represents the matter as if I had studied the stove as 
one among the many things in the world. But if I was 
contemplating the stove, IT was my world, and every-
thing else colorless by contrast with it.  For it is equally 
possible to take the bare present image as the worth-
less momentary picture in the whole temporal world, 
and as the true world among shadows.”
7 
Wittgenstein speaks of the importance that “seeing” or 
“contemplating” has for ethics, and the difference between 
seeing through a perspective of facts and seeing through a 
perspective of value . Seeing a thing “as a thing among 
things” is the perspective of facts, where there is no value. 
Value or significance is not about something other than 
facts, as if I changed object of sight and started looking at 
something else, but it is about a different way of contem-
plating facts, it is about seeing the same thing differently. 
We could call this way of seeing seeing through possibili-
ties of meaning, namely through possibilities of significant 
use. 
Regarding the example of the stove, in any case what I 
contemplate is the stove; however, the difference lies in 
contemplating the stove as a thing among things or con-
templating the stove as such. This is what makes the stove 
a world and everything else colorless. Color is also a help-
ful notion here because it helps us better understand that 
significance is not about a change in facts but it concerns 
a change in the way of seeing. Color does not change 
what the picture represents, for instance one can have a 
picture representing a basket with fruits which remains the 
same picture whether it is in color or in black and white.  
2.Seeing something as a whole: ethics with aesthetics 
How can one contemplate a thing as a world? Wittgenstein 
links the contemplation of a thing as a world and of the 
world as a whole, with the contemplation of the thing or the 
world sub specie aeternitatis. As he says in the entry which 
precedes the one we cited above:  
“The work of art is the object seen sub specie aeternita-
tis; and the good life is the world seen sub specie 
aeternitatis . This is the connexion between art and eth-
ics. [...] (The thought forces itself upon one): The thing 
seen sub specie aeternitatis is the thing seen together 
with the whole logical space.”8 
Both ethics and aesthetics are thus about a way of seeing, 
a way of contemplation. This contemplation is character-
ized in two ways by Wittgenstein in the above-cited pas-
sage: “sub specie aeternitatis” and “seeing something to-
gether with its logical space”. I suggest then that it is only if 
we read together these different ways of seeing, that we 
can understand what this way of seeing is about. Further-
more, I suggest that if we follow such a reading then we 
can better understand how such a way of seeing is related 
to the notion of meaning (or can give us a notion of mean-
ing which also bears an aspect of value).   
                                                      
7 NB, p. 83, 8. 10. 16 
8 NB, p.82, 7.10.16 
Let me start with Wittgenstein's reference to art; the ex-
ample of art can help us to understand giving meaning in 
holistic terms, namely as involving contemplating a thing 
as a world rather than giving some specific meaning. Aes-
thetic perception does not see things as belonging to a 
certain class, but rather in their own right. It does not con-
sider them as useful for this or that purpose, not even as 
ugly or beautiful, but simply as being. One can see useless 
things or ugly things as works of arts and if one is asked 
why one contemplates a thing as a work of art, one can 
give no specific answer about a specific quality of the 
thing, but it is rather that the thing is invested with signifi-
cance as a whole. In that sense it is not relevant to an aes-
thetic contemplation of a painting neither the topic of the 
painting nor the specific colour the painter used, but its 
aesthetic value lies in it as a whole. The aristotelian “the 
whole is greater than the sum of its parts” makes perfect 
sense in this case. 
Let us now see how “sub specie aeterni” (seeing as a 
whole) is related not only to language, but moreover to 
language as a web of relations between propositions. 
If when we make sense we are just situated inside logi-
cal space (since making sense is interrelated with logical 
operations), then to be able to see through the whole logi-
cal space could amount to recovering the conditions of 
sense, namely to seeing a word or a proposition within a 
web of its relations with other words or propositions or else 
within the web of its significant uses.  
As Diamond says: “In terms of metaphor of logical 
space, the Tractatus view can be put this way: we become 
clear what our sentences mean by becoming clear what 
place within logical space they determine. We get the lay-
out (as it were) of logical space through our grasp of logi-
cal relations.”9  
Grasping logical relations is not a matter of digging and 
going deep in the foundations of logic, but it can be rather 
regarded as a process taking place horizontally, a process 
of laying out the relations between words and propositions, 
through their use. In the Tractatus (5.557), Wittgenstein 
explicitly says that it is the application of logic which de-
cides about elementary propositions, or else, about the 
forms of the objects,  or else about the meaning of our 
words and sentences.  Seeing something with the whole 
logical space does not mean going outside logic but rather 
recovering its conditions through its application.  
If “seeing as a whole” amounts to “seeing together with 
the whole logical space”, namely to the recovery of a web 
of meaningful relations between propositions, then this is 
how value can be understood as a dimension of language 
itself. And such a connection allows us to avoid indeed 
both a mere perspective of facts which would relativize 
value, but also a perspective of transcendence which 
would regard value as something ineffable, as something 
beyond language. Value is manifested through language 
not as some specific, localizable fact, but in the very exist-
ence of language qua locus of meaningfulness.

Another reading of the Tractatus: a comparisons' path 
Valentina Balestracci

Abstract 
After almost a century since its publication, the Tractatus still keeps an aura of obscurity which continues to fascinate whoever 
has the occasion to read it. Recognizing a too big difficulty in giving a clarification, the purpose of this paper is just giving one of 
the possible accounts that we can use in order to be able to familiarly move between the terminology of this work: an overall 
example, on which we will concentrate, is the word “Bild” which is translated as “image”, but which presents more affinities with 
the word “analogy”. 
 
 
1. Tatsache and Sachverhalte 
Etymologically speaking, the German term “Tatsache”, 
which is translated with “fact”, indicates something which is 
in movement, which is submitted to an activity (tat).  
On the other hand, “Sachverhalt” indicates something in 
which things maintain a precise relationship between 
themselves, forming a configuration.  
Now, Wittgenstein explains us that the world is made of 
Tatsache and that every Tatsache is made of Sachver-
halte which, then, are made of objects that are the sim-
plest parts of that which seems a hierarchy.  
Before understanding why it's so important underlining 
these concepts in order to comprehend the Tractatus, it's 
necessary to say that things are not so easy: even if there 
is a link between them, we cannot imagine a kind of rela-
tionship like an ordered scheme with separate levels going 
from the simplest to the complexest.  
Someone could namely say that the difference between 
Sachverhalte and Tatsache would be that the first is some-
thing static rather than the second which has a movement 
instead. Nevertheless the term “Sachverhalt” contains the 
root of the verb “halten” which in German means “to keep”: 
this indicates an internal movement who is in opposition in 
considering it as a static thing. Besides we cannot think 
about a Sachverhalt coming before the Tatsache, in terms 
of time or in terms of a stasis and then a movement: Witt-
genstein doesn't even mention this relation and, besides, 
where's the point in which the Sachverhalte becomes 
Tatsache supposed to be?  
The main characteristics are that the Tatsache simply 
happens, the Sachverhalt simply is. They conserve their 
own autonomy between their relation and any verbal time 
is not applicable. To understand what we are meaning with 
“relation” we have to keep in mind that the world is not for 
Wittgenstein composed by things (objects, entities and so 
on) but by relations which are developing through the 
Tatsache that we can also call events. In other words we 
can think about Tatsache and Sachverhalte in the same 
rapport that stands between potency and act in Aristotle.  
Till the moment we don't establish a connection - a rela-
tion - the world is made by objects which don't communi-
cate between them, which are completely independent. 
Actually, Wittgenstein is saying that objects are independ-
ent but the relation who can be developed, is already pre-
sent in some way, in the field of possibility: so in reality “to 
be developed” is the wrong term, because it just has to 
come out.  
Tatsache, Sachverhalte and objects are at the same 
level, the logical level in which all the possibilities stay. We 
don't have to think like a bowl that has to be fulfilled, nor 
like a place in which every level is closed in itself, but we 
have rather to think to an hand which simultaneously 
opens and closes itself: it cannot overcome the maximal 
expansion of the space which it occupies when it's open, 
that is it cannot overcome its space of possibilities.  
Now, we have the elements to understand the reason 
why these concepts are so fundamental for the compre-
hension of the Tractatus: logic is the space and the struc-
ture of any possibility, we said, and this means that it is the 
ground of our language. Remember in fact that in the Trac-
tatus' Preface Wittgenstein is speaking especially about 
language and its limit. Every proposition emerges in this 
space in which it is already present in some way.  
The connection is that Wittgenstein refers to the proposi-
tion as also a fact1, that is a Tatsache: the proposition is an 
event in the logic space, something complex , constituted 
by parts , in movement and with a specific position.  
 
2. The logical form 
Tatsache and propositions nevertheless differ because of 
the statute of image of the second: the first collocates itself 
at a logical level, but the proposition is on a linguistic level. 
What does it changes between logic and linguistic level? 
Paraphrasing Wittgenstein, the language is perceivable to 
the senses, rather than the logic to which we don't have 
any direct access.  
In this point Wittgenstein had the problem to find a con-
nection between these two levels: reality and image have 
in common the logical form, one of the main concept of the 
Tractatus and for which we again don't have an explana-
tion.  
Image is something built in respect to reality even if we 
don't know, so to say, the degree of artificiality. “We build 
images about facts
2”: we don't directly see facts, but we 
build for us, their images for which there's no coincidence, 
but correspondence because between image and fact 
there's an indirect relationship inasmuch there's an equal-
ity of rapports. 
What Wittgenstein is saying is that images cannot repre-
sent the proper logical form: they exhibit it. The verb's root

is “exhibere” from latin “ex habere”, literally to have out-
side: that means that the representation form is in the im-
age itself, from which it emerges and it shows itself. The 
logical form is the internal property which legitimatises the 
image to be like that but which for itself doesn't have any 
image; Keep in mind that saying to have an image is dif-
ferent than to be an image: if the logical form doesn't have 
an image, we will see its affinity with the concept of Urbild.  
If the proposition is posited in the logical space and ex-
hibits the logical form, this posits itself as the emergent 
residual of that space which, occupying the totality of the 
possible, is not determined and it is so shapeless. Turn to 
the dichotomy between to say and to show (sagen und 
zeigen) according to which “what it can be showed cannot 
be said”: the logical form is inexpressible because it cannot 
be expressed with propositions, that is images; it doesn't 
have image because it's nothing built. Without any struc-
ture or cover it presents itself like naked; the language 
finds its limit in the expression because the logical form is 
impossible to define.  
In reality the concept of logical form is not new but inher-
ited by Russell, although with another meaning. Namely for 
the English philosopher it is a complex and residual object 
which we have direct knowledge of, something which 
would precede the realization and the comprehension of 
the sentences from our part. It furnishes unity to the 
proposition: once have broken the sentence up in its con-
stituents and once composed again, this wasn't sufficient 
to the unity of the proposition. The logical form is the addi-
tional total factor, major of the sum of parts which furnishes 
that researched unity in the proposition. It couldn't receive 
unity from the judgement, subjective considered. For Rus-
sell it's possible a direct acquaintance of the logical form, 
through that it defines logical experience that Wittgenstein 
later will deny. If for Russell the logical form is an object, 
for Wittgenstein logical objects don't exist. For Wittgenstein 
the object has - but it's not -  a form. This concept has af-
finities with “condition” , “possibility” and also “structure”. 
Keeping this in mind it's necessary to remember that 
there's no logical experience for Wittgenstein. 
The logical form has to be literally understood in the 
sense that the logic doesn't directly present itself to us and 
it is a shapeless path which emerges with a kind of form in 
the proposition and we notice this in tautologies and con-
tradictions, which represent the limits of the language. 
Since a tautology is always true and a contradiction is al-
ways false, they don't need any comparison with the reality 
and the first occupies all the logic space rather than the 
second which doesn't occupy any point in that same 
space. They don't give us any information but what they do 
is to permit to the logical form to emerge in them. In this 
way the logic manifests itself and make us understand that 
this is the path of our language. Wittgenstein doesn't indi-
cate an element in the proposition that we can identify with 
the logical form but he's trying to say that without any con-
tent, what is left is the form and properly this form is the 
sign which inform us about a ground which we cannot 
usually notice in our language.  
The Austrian philosopher is using the word “Bild” to indi-
cate the word image, but this word presents more affinities 
with the concept of analogy, rather than the common 
sense of a representation that we have in mind. In fact for 
Wittgenstein to be in relation of image with the reality it 
doesn't mean to copy, imitate or to coincide with the real-
ity, but it means that there is an indirect relationship, that is 
of correspondence in which every part in the image stays 
in rapport with the other part in the same way in which the 
parts stayed between them in the reality.  
The relationship that the language has in respect to the 
logic is its statute of image, but what if we “take a look” 
from the logic point of view? In fact “the logic image of the 
facts is the thought3” that provokes not a few problems 
inasmuch logic comes before (although not in temporal 
terms) the image and, on the other hand, the image is in 
some way artificial and with a degree of fiction inasmuch 
we said that we build the image. Posit another time the 
matter: is the thought concerning the logic or is it an im-
age?  
If we pay attention to the concept of “Urbild” we could 
maybe find an helpful connection: in fact we could call the 
Urbild like a pre-image, what is an image instead of to just 
have an image. In this way the concepts of Urbild, logical 
form and logical image could be connected in what it's the 
archetype which gives birth to the figurativity of the lan-
guage.  
If we continue through this line we can reflect about the 
language and the logic which find a common element in 
the logical form; now, if we remember that the wittgen-
steinian concept of image is similar to the concept of anal-
ogy because it is based on a correspondence, that is an 
indirect relationship it means that there shouldn't be a 
common element; besides, finding a common element is a 
valid but not sufficient reason to argument the state of im-
age. What if we thought logic and language as two parallel 
planes which because of definition of parallel don't have 
any possibility of connection? Nothing would prevent us to 
establish a correspondence in which the relationship be-
tween parts is maintained constant. This hypothesis would 
be legitimated since Wittgenstein is looking for a natural 
connection between two levels who don't seem to have: 
the connection there would be in virtue of a natural similar-
ity which we develop on the basis of what we see but that 
we build. If we imagine the analogy as Kant did it, like a 
bridge between two different grounds we could still say 
that there is a common element. Paraphrasing the Austrian 
philosopher he later will say that logic is the specular im-
age of the language, as a confirm that they are on the 
same level; still when the language reflects on itself he 
meets the logic through the analogical mirror: since we 
don't have access to that plane, language has a perceiv-
able way to let us know about the thought. He says: “Lan-
guage disguises the thought; so that from the external 
form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought 
they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is 
constructed with quite another object than to let the form of 
the body be recognized.”4 
In this case it seems that the language is trying to de-
ceive us because it covers the thought; in reality the situa-
tion is the opposite inasmuch is the thought which is for us 
accessible through the language, since the logic level is 
not accessible for us, as if we couldn't enter in the mirror. 
What it seemed like a way to deceive us, it transformed in 
a mean of knowledge. 
Still, there is something else to say about the difference 
between image and proposition: if this is an image, the link 
is not reciprocal because not only the images are proposi-
tions. In fact the main difference is that the image for Witt-
genstein cannot be negated inasmuch she's silent: we 
cannot say that it is true or false. Remember that the 
proposition can be negated but if we take two propositions, 
one positive and one negative we have to keep that they 
refer to the same fact: this means that the symbol of nega-
tion doesn't have any meaning. It is constructed and it

doesn't “stay for” anything, it is not image of nothing. It 
can, like the other logic constants, disappears. This means 
that they are not images but Wittgenstein doesn't say that 
they don't have image.  Which is the consequence in say-
ing that they aren't images? It means that they are some-
thing connected with the wittgensteinian concept of reality. 
Wittgenstein will say that this is his main thought because 
what we are saying it is constructed in reality is what is 
real. It won't be a chance that in the sixtieth proposition the 
Austrian philosopher will say that the negation is what the 
reality is moving through.  
The language is complete in itself: we have to keep in 
mind that Wittgenstein didn't want to create an artificial 
language or to reach a logical perfect language. If “the 
words are just like a film on deep water” is legitimated to 
think about the language like a sort of cover in respect of 
something which, at the first sight, stays obscure and un-
known. A film is able to apply and perfectly adequate to 
which it covers, to the point which can be almost impossi-
ble to be distinguished. In our case nevertheless, the water 
doesn't have possess of a shape: it's the water to adapt to 
the shape which the film, capturing it, furnishes to it.

On Saying Nothing: Wittgenstein's Conception of the Right Method 
in Philosophy 
Gisela Susanna Bengtsson  
Bergen, Norway | gisela.bengtsson@fof.uib.no 
Abstract 
In this paper I discuss Wittgenstein's conception of "saying nothing" or "making no assertions" as the proper way of doing 
philosophy in the Tractatus, the Investigations and in On Certainty. I also point to a connection between this conception of 
philosophy and Wittgenstein's conception of logic. 
 
 
1. The Form of a Philosophical Problem 
In section 123 of the Investigations Wittgenstein writes: 
“Ein Philosophisches Problem hat die Form: Ich kenne 
mich nicht aus.” A common translation is “A philosophical 
problem has the form: I don’t know my way about” (Witt-
genstein 2001). Another possible translation of the last 
words would be: “I don’t recognize these surroundings”. It 
is natural to connect section 123 with the metaphor of a 
journey in the Preface: Wittgenstein tells us that “The phi-
losophical remarks in this book are, as it were, a number of 
sketches of landscapes which were made in the course of 
these long and involved journeyings.” The starting point for 
his investigations was hence precisely the recognition that 
“I don’t recognize these surroundings” – and the metaphor 
suggests that the sketches are to serve as directions. And 
a person who first begins to read the Investigations could 
certainly use some directions: it does not look like a work 
in philosophy with its many examples and lack of any im-
mediate system and order. Wittgenstein's starting point is 
thus reflected in the starting point of a reader, and it has 
the form of the philosophical problem as described in sec-
tion 123. 
The Tractatus is a different matter: the text certainly 
looks like a work in philosophy and the views of the author 
are, it seems, in plain view (Wittgenstein 1986). We there-
fore think that we will know our way about. But the para-
doxical character of the book overthrows our sense of rec-
ognition. The form of the Tractatus, which at first made us 
feel certain that we are familiar with the surroundings, is 
also what shows us that we had no reason to feel so cer-
tain. We could perhaps say then, that the Investigations 
doesn't look like what it is, whereas the Tractatus looks like 
something which it is not. The many voices of the Investi-
gations give us difficulties: finding out what the author 
wants to say is not easy if we do not know how to identify 
his voice. Whether it is appropriate to say that he has said 
anything at all is an open question. In the following my fo-
cus will be on Wittgenstein's conception of 'saying nothing' 
as the proper way of doing philosophy. 
2. The Tractatus  
If we want to understand central concepts in the Tractatus, 
it is natural look at remarks that look like definitions:  
4: The thought is the significant proposition [sinnvolle 
Satz]. 
3.5 The applied, thought, propositional sign is the 
thought. 
4.01: The proposition is a picture of reality. 
2.1. We make ourselves pictures of facts. 
2.12 The picture is a model of reality 
2.141 The picture is a fact. 
3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a class of names 
cannot.  
3.3 Only the proposition has sense; only in the context 
of a proposition has a name meaning. 
3.14 The propositional sign is a fact. 
Thought, proposition, picture and fact are all explained or 
defined by each other: the thought is a proposition, the 
proposition is a fact, the picture is a fact, the propositional 
sign is fact and if we look at 3.142 and 3.3. together we 
see that only facts can express a sense but also that only 
propositions have sense – this suggests that propositions 
are facts (or the other way around perhaps). This kind of 
clarification is one of the aspects of the Tractatus that have 
lead interpreters to say that it disintegrates when read as a 
theory. Looking at the quoted remarks, one could say that 
fact, proposition, thought and picture are all in a sense one 
– or that it is said in the book that they are all one. This is 
also indicated about language and the world in 4.014.: 
the gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, 
the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that pic-
torial internal relation, which holds between language 
and the world. To all of them the logical structure is 
common. (Like the two youths, their two horses and 
their lilies in the story. They are all in a certain sense 
one). 
Here, Wittgenstein probably refers to a fairy tale by the 
brothers Grimm: a fisherman catches a golden fish with the 
capacity to fulfill wishes. The fish tells him to chop him up 
in six parts, give two to his wife, two to his horse and to 
bury two parts in the garden. After some time, the fisher-
man’s wife gives birth to two golden boys, the horse has 
two golden foals, and two golden lilies grow in the garden. 
The foals, the boys and the lilies are related in such a way 
that when a boy is in danger, his lily withers, and when he 
is rescued, his lily immediately flowers. In a certain sense 
they are all one, as Wittgenstein writes. Let’s see how 
something similar goes on when it comes to the relation 
between logic and philosophy in the Tractatus.  
Part of Wittgenstein’s project is to demonstrate that 
Frege's and Russell’s conception of logic as a science is 
mistaken. Their conception of propositions of logic as ex-
pressing thoughts is based on misunderstandings, accord-
ing to the Tractatus' view. Instead Wittgenstein presents a 
picture of logic as the scaffolding of the world: 

On Saying Nothing: Wittgenstein's Conception of the Right Method in Philosophy | Gisela Susanna Bengtsson 
 
 
 
19
5.43: [...] But all propositions of logic say the same 
thing. That is nothing.  
6.1222: […] logical propositions can no more be empiri-
cally confirmed than they can be empirically refuted. 
Not only must a proposition of logic be incapable of be-
ing contradicted by any possible experience, but it must 
also be incapable of being confirmed by any such. 
6.124: The logical propositions describe the scaffolding 
[Gerüst] of the world, or rather they present it. They 
“treat” of nothing. […]It is clear that it must show some-
thing about the world that certain combinations of sym-
bols – which essentially have a definite character – are 
tautologies. 
6.13:   Logic is not a theory but a reflexion of the world. 
Logic is transcendental. 
6.22:  The logic of the world which the propositions of 
logic show in tautologies, mathematics shows in equa-
tions. 
What I want to draw attention to is simply that in the Trac-
tatus we find a view of logic as “saying nothing”, and a 
conception of logical propositions as being neither true nor 
false and that this “must show something about the world” 
(6.124). Let’s compare what we have seen with some re-
marks on ‘philosophy’, and the famous outline of the “right 
method of philosophy”: 
6.53: The right method [richtige Methode] in philosophy 
would really be the following: to say nothing except 
what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural sci-
ence - i.e. something that has nothing to do with phi-
losophy - and then, whenever someone else wanted to 
say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that 
he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his 
propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the 
other person – he would not have the feeling that we 
were teaching him philosophy - this method would be 
the only strictly correct one.  
4.111: Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. 
(The word “philosophy” must mean something which 
stands above or below, but not besides the natural sci-
ences.) 
4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarification 
of thoughts. Philosophy is not a theory but an activity. A 
philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. 
The result of philosophy is not a number of “philosophi-
cal propositions”, but to make propositions clear. Phi-
losophy should make clear and delimit sharply the 
thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and 
blurred.  
From 4.111-4.112 we learn that philosophy is neither a 
theory nor a science, and that a philosophical investigation 
doesn't result in “philosophical propositions” i.e. it does not 
aim at true propositions. The “logical clarification of 
thoughts” is instead the goal, and this indicates the tight 
connection between logic and philosophy.  
3. The Investigations 
I would now like to return to Wittgenstein's description of 
the form of a philosophical problem as “I don’t know my 
way about” (PI§123). The connection between this form 
and the role of remarks that Wittgenstein refers to as 
"grammatical" or "logical" is that they make something ex-
plicit that we are already familiar with. They don't serve as 
information but as directions that we might need. We can 
also look at this conception of the form of a philosophical 
problem in connection with the idiosyncratic form of the 
Investigations. To bring out how Wittgenstein’s use of ex-
amples there can be seen as a way of doing philosophy in 
the right way, we will look at a passage from The Voices of 
Wittgenstein: 
We wish to examine an example which throws light on 
the method that we follow. Frege criticized the view ac-
cording to which arithmetic is a mere game with sym-
bols. […] We could say: ‘Let us put aside entirely the 
question whether arithmetic is a game or not!’ One 
thing is clear: there must be a certain relationship here, 
otherwise nobody would have arrived at this idea. 
Therefore let us then examine what games are! Let us 
then juxtapose this investigation of games with the in-
vestigation of arithmetic, and let one throw light on the 
other! Let us be perfectly neutral, making no assertions 
[behaupten wir nichts], but allowing these things speak 
for themselves! This is the standpoint from which we 
wish to investigate language. We want to avoid dogma-
tizing, but rather leave language as it is and juxtapose 
with it a grammatical picture, the features of which are 
fully under our control. We construct as it were an ideal 
case, but without claiming that it agrees with anything. 
We construct it solely in order to obtain a surveyable 
pattern with which to compare language; as an aspect, 
so to speak, which, in virtue of its asserting nothing, is 
also not false. (Wittgenstein 2003, p. 279)  
We bear in mind that the sketches Wittgenstein makes 
during his "journeyings" can be understood as his exam-
ples of language games and the quoted passage indicates 
that "grammatical pictures" of this kind of display and re-
mind us of "an aspect of language", but they assert noth-
ing.  
4. On Certainty 
In On Certainty, Wittgenstein points out that it is philoso-
phically uninteresting that Moore knows this or that, but 
that we all know what Moore says he knows, is interesting 
(Wittgenstein 1969, §§84, 462, 520). Part of Wittgenstein’s 
point can be described by words borrowed from 6.124 in 
the Tractatus: that we all know what Moore says he knows 
must “show something about the world”. In On Certainty, 
Wittgenstein draws our attention to the fact that it is difficult 
to imagine why someone should believe the contrary of 
what Moore claims. His propositions are similar to tautolo-
gies in the Tractatus in the sense that they “allow every 
possible state of affairs” (TLP 4.462).  Since nothing in our 
picture of the world speaks in favor of the opposite we 
could also say that they are trivial (OC§ 93). 
Wittgenstein indicates that “logical propositions” describe 
the conceptual or linguistic situation (OC§ 51) and that 
“everything descriptive of a language game is part of logic” 
(OC§ 56). Towards the end of his notes he adds “Am I not 
getting closer and closer to saying that in the end logic 
cannot be described?”(OC§ 501). The reference here is to 
the central theme in the Tractatus: the logical form of lan-
guage, thought and the world cannot be represented in 
propositions (TLP 4.12 -4.121). In On Certainty, Wittgen-
stein suggests that propositions such as those Moore 
claims to know, function as a “background” against which 
we distinguish between true and false, and he speaks of 
them as as an “element” in which our arguments have a 
life (OC§§ 94, 105). Wittgenstein also suggests that certain 
propositions form a “scaffolding of our thoughts” (OC§ 
211). This metaphor is also used by Wittgenstein in the 
Tractatus and in the Investigations. In 6.124 of the Trac-

tatus Wittgenstein uses scaffolding [Gerüst] as a metaphor 
for “logic” or “logical form” and writes that logical proposi-
tions show logical form, but also that we can see logical 
propositions as describing logic. In the Investigations Witt-
genstein writes: 
§ 240: Disputes do not break out (among mathemati-
cians, say) over the question whether a rule has been 
obeyed or not. People don't come to blows over it, for 
example. That is part of the framework [Gerüst] on 
which the working of our language is based (for exam-
ple, in giving descriptions). 
In On Certainty, a similar point is made in section 83: Witt-
genstein observes that the truth of certain empirical propo-
sitions belongs to our frame of reference [Bezugsystem] 
and in section 81 he writes that "if I make certain false 
statements it becomes unclear whether I understand 
them". The metaphor of a scaffolding is found in a set of 
remarks, where Wittgenstein uses an example of calling a 
friend in New York who describes the buds of his tree – am 
I then convinced, Wittgenstein asks, that his tree is, for 
instance a magnolia tree and that the earth exists? (§209). 
He goes on to ask: 
OC § 210: Does my telephone call to New York 
strengthen my conviction that the earth exists? Much 
seems to be fixed, and it is removed from the traffic. It 
is so to speak shunted onto an unused siding. 
OC § 211: Now it gives our way of looking at things, 
and our researches, their form. Perhaps it was once 
disputed. But perhaps, for unthinkable ages, it has be-
longed to the scaffolding [Gerüst] of our thoughts. 
(Every human being has parents.) (Original emphasis). 
We notice that scaffolding is a framework that surrounds 
something else and here the scaffolding forms the sur-
roundings of our language use, i.e. the very surroundings 
that presented difficulties for Wittgenstein when he set out 
on his philosophical investigations.   
To conclude I want to point out that Wittgenstein takes 
Moore’s propositions and places them in various contexts. 
That is, Moore is the one who makes claims (that he 
knows this or that) while Wittgenstein demonstrates that 
some of the signs in Moore’s propositions – typically “I 
know”- have not been given a meaning. It is therefore pos-
sible to conceive of Wittgenstein's investigations in On 
Certainty as a way of doing philosophy without making as-
sertions.

Complying with real-life memory experiences. A notion of memory 
as performed 
Ondrej Beran 
Prague / Pilsen, Czech Republic | jerdnonareb@seznam.cz 
Abstract 
In my paper, I present some features of Wittgenstein’s view on memory, opposite to the mainstream analytical 
representationalism of memory and congenial rather to phenomenologies of memory. I try to show that his transcendental 
account of memory can allow elaborating more properly the real-life memory experiences like traumatic memories.  
 
 
1. 
Within the analytical philosophy, we observe certain pref-
erences for metaphysical representationalism of memory. 
The analytical philosophy of mind, as represented, e.g., in 
the works by Jerry Fodor (2010), espouses a “storage 
concept of memory”. According to this view, memories are 
stored within the subject’s mind or brain; things are re-
membered, as far as they can be “saved” into the storage 
and as long as they are kept there. These philosophical 
views echo folk-psychological intuitions about memory. 
Many of these intuitions touch the question of the capacity 
of memory: as a place or a storage space, memory has to 
have a limit of what it can absorb: only some bulk of 
data/material can fit in. 
This folk-psychological intuition is difficult to substantiate 
by hard-scientific methods. Memories can no longer be 
understood as independent data/units of certain (absolute) 
“size” and the mechanism of their keeping and recalling is 
rather different from plain storing and retrieving. On the 
other hand, a lot of anecdotic evidence and reported eve-
ryday experience advocates for the storage concept: from 
some point on, we experience that we cannot keep more 
memories anymore – “that many things just cannot fit into 
my head”. Or we experience that it is uncomfortable or 
painful to keep the memories, especially traumatic memo-
ries are of the nature that “I remember too much to bear”. I 
will try to suggest possible non-representationalist and 
non-storage accounts for these familiar memory experi-
ences of, on the face of it, storage character. I will use 
Wittgenstein’s remarks on memory that are clearly non-
representationalist, which is a rather rare thing in the ana-
lytical tradition. 
The storage concept or representationalism of memory 
is, however, much older than the linguistic turn; we meet it 
in the early Modern philosophers like Descartes or Locke. 
For them, the representations are by their nature images. 
Only later, with Russell (to whom Fodor owes something) 
the idea is introduced that memory representations have 
propositional form, just as everything that can be either 
true or false (Russell 1922). The capacity of memories to 
take truth values seems obvious. Now, the problem for the 
contemporary representationalist philosophies of memory 
is to reconcile the propositional view on memory with the 
need to explain the mechanism of storing these proposi-
tional contents somewhere outside the actually used pro-
positional capacity. Note that when we recall something 
after a time of oblivion, the content, as it seems, had to be 
stored, as it were, somewhere beyond the realm of actual 
speech capacity, untouched. With the current break-
throughs in the cognitive science, the need becomes more 
and more the need to locate these stored contents into the 
human brain. 
2. 
In the same time, the classical phenomenology presented 
sophisticated and much deeper insights on memory than 
most its analytical contemporaries. Husserl (2013) pointed 
to memory as a special kind of intentional capacity (reten-
tion), thematizing the quality “past”. This intentional activity 
is connected inextricably with the constitution of the inner 
consciousness of time. For Husserl, the consciousness of 
time is necessary for constituting any meaningful experi-
ence (any meaningful intentional object), for our experi-
ence flows within time and the unification of all its levels 
and sediments takes place within time, too. An explicit 
awareness of remembering the past is not always needed. 
For Husserl, memory does not have to be propositional, 
since the intention is directed to objects and constitutes 
pictures. On the other hand, his view is not just representa-
tionalist – memory is a (crucial) constituent of the unity of 
the meaningful experience on the horizon of world, open to 
the temporal consciousness. The role of memory is there-
fore transcendental. 
Heidegger (1977) does not dedicate much space to ex-
plicit treatise of memory, but something can be deduced 
from his analyses of human temporality and historicity. 
Human being is inherently temporal; it encompasses the 
unity of the “thrown”, factual background of our past, and 
the “projection” into our future. Heidegger strongly op-
poses the “physicalistic” views on time as a sequence of 
moments, all alike. Time is a meaningful whole as such; it 
is a dimension of human existence as meaningful. Only as 
temporal beings can humans have (live in) history. Again, 
similarly to Husserl, we see that memory is a constituent 
part of the human mode of being which is intrinsically tem-
poral. But in Heidegger the structure of human existence, 
as he exposes it, is less perception-related and considera-
bly more pragmatic. 
Merleau-Ponty (1945) turned his attention to the connec-
tion between memory and habit. Only he paid considerable 
attention to the phenomenology of memory as bodily ex-
perience. For Merleau-Ponty, who saw perception as the 
foundation and standpoint for any philosophical investiga-
tion, body was the principal bearer of memory. He points to 
such experiences like fear and withdrawing from burning 
stove. Body bears traces of previous experiences, which 
are materialized in situated, bodily actions. Through these 
observations, he also implies that memory is more properly 
perceived as a skill, rather than as a matter of awareness 
or keeping perspicuous records of past information (or ex-
perience). 
Merleau-Ponty’s relative independence of the cognitivis-
tic frameworks of memory as exemplified by Husserl and 
Heidegger can be due to his roots within the Bergsonian

tradition. Bergson was the first to highlight that we speak 
of “memory” in different senses: distinct recollections of 
various contents on the one hand and instilled, kept habits 
on the other hand. (A similar distinction was later made 
also by Russell.) The distinction is elaborated in psychol-
ogy to the particulars of procedural, semantic and episodic 
memory (in various terminologies). From this viewpoint, 
memory seems to be of mixed nature. 
3. 
Wittgenstein’s approaches to memory are multiple. In his 
“middle” period (1984a) he stresses two major points. 1) 
The putative “units” of memory should be of a “pictorial” 
nature only in so far as the Tractarian-like notion of picture 
is retained. Memories are logical pictures, in the sense that 
there is a relation between them and the remembered (de-
picted) contents, relation capable of the evaluation 
true/false. Memories can be true or not true. 2) Memory, 
on the other hand, is the source (transcendental basis) of 
time and past, that is, meaningful temporal concepts and 
concepts of past. In the latter sense, memory is no picture 
and the question of its veracity is secondary at best. This 
dichotomy is connected to the two concepts of time, ana-
lyzed by Wittgenstein: the physical/information time and 
the memory time. The latter sense of time thematizes 
memory as the source of any meaningful experience. 
There are not three equal modes of time – past, present 
and future – but what we call present is a borderline of our 
description of the continual perception and experience that 
is and can be meaningful only as continual (in a sense, 
past as a whole). Memory is the means of connecting the 
elements of our continual experience into one meaningful, 
truly continual whole. And as it is a source of logical rela-
tions (concepts as “the same” or “similar” couldn’t have the 
same sense without memory), we cannot reasonably talk 
about its being more or less exact, or getting pale and 
vague. These are the ways reserved for talking about 
memory as picture. 
In his later notes, Wittgenstein (1984) enriches this logi-
cal analysis by more straightforward link to the philosophy 
of mind and philosophy of psychology. He notes that it is 
rather misleading to ask for causal underpinnings of 
memories within our brains. It is, after all, not our brain 
what remembers the things, but it is ourselves who do so. 
Let us recall here Wittgenstein’s (2009) discussion of pos-
sible bearers of thought. We are tempted, investigating 
whether things like chairs can be thinking, to ask questions 
like: Where does the chair think? In its backrest? The ab-
surdity of such question (and answer) is palpable in hu-
mans. There is no “where” they think. People do not think 
in their heads; not just because with one’s head cut off 
thinking would be excluded, but not with a cut-off hand. 
People just perform thinking and thinking is a located phe-
nomenon only indirectly, as far as the thinker her-
self/himself is located. Similarly we need the background 
and organization of our brains to be remembering crea-
tures, but that does not mean memory is intrinsically lo-
cated and causally determined (though there are recent 
attempts – more sophisticated than Fodor’s – to explain 
memory in terms of its embeddedness into the structures 
of brain, e.g. Dreyfus 2002). Memory is located to its 
bearer who performs it. (For Wittgenstein’s concept of 
memory see also Stern 1991, Moyal-Sharrock 2009.) 
To display such remembered knowledge as “Caesar was 
killed in 44 BC” is a performative competence, too, con-
nected to a context (just as displaying the skill of playing 
piano). The notion of memory as performance is echoed in 
contemporary philosophies of memory, too (Campbell 
2003). What and how we remember is framed and consti-
tuted through our practice of intersubjective relations with 
others. A lot of seemingly external factors enter this proc-
ess, strongly influenced by associative contexts, bodily 
conventions, gender-related conventions, etc. The particu-
lar way memory is performed goes along with one’s 
“thrownness”, in Heidegger words. It is memory what al-
lows a meaningful thrownness; and thrown as we are, no 
two people seem to remember exactly the same things or, 
more importantly, perform their memory exactly the same 
way. 
For Wittgenstein, memory is thus indispensable as a 
source of human normative practice. It is memory what 
constitutes the coherent experience of continual past 
amounting to the meaningful present experience. The se-
mantics of language, human normative relationships and 
institutions, but also such things as the awareness of tradi-
tions, histories and identity cannot be conceived without 
functioning memory – the source of time and at the same 
time picture of past. The constitution of meaning etc. origi-
nates in the pragmatic field of intersubjective practices; the 
performance of memory is thus in the same sense prag-
matic and intersubjective. These pragmatic aspects allow 
us to incorporate also the habitual, procedural memories. 
The skills we keep carry certain inner logic and embody 
rules adopted by the agent – the memory being the source 
of the skill is bodily (Ingold 2011), but at the same time not 
only bodily. The repeated, acquired skill has a purpose, 
logically keeping the exercise (practice) together as nor-
matively meaningful  
4. 
The performative and embodied (but not just bodily in the 
narrow sense) notion of practice allows us to sketch a pos-
sible framework for tackling the everyday memory experi-
ences. Why is it that we cannot stuff infinitely much bulk 
into our memory and from some point, the memories start 
to fall out again? As far as memory is performed by bodily 
agents, certain limits are set to this performance. We may 
not see them as directly “natural”, but they are connected 
to the bodily character of memory enaction. The bodily lim-
its of memories-keeping do not relate straightforwardly to a 
given, determinate capacity of brain, say (any more than 
limits of storytelling which requires having a brain, too, but 
is not a deterministic brain capacity either). What we per-
ceive as a “natural” measure for human performance, is 
constituted within the network of social practice, with such 
normative concepts as “mistakes”, “trials”, “failures”, “insuf-
ficiencies”. However intrinsically rational and normative, 
human agents are expected to fail. These “negative” con-
cepts delimit the sense of the situated practice, as we 
know it. 
The very notion of skill would seem not to make sense, if 
it assumed infinity or unlimitedness. From some finite point 
on, one is considered as remembering enough to be com-
petent (history teacher, guitar player, etc.). Practice requir-
ing memory is ultimately conceived as finite; “remember-
ing” standing in the opposition to “not remembering” is – 
under analysis – not “remembering everything”, but “re-
membering enough” (or just anything). Let us also consider 
that the idea of remembering everything is rather difficult to 
reconcile with our everyday experience in a way that would 
make sense: How does such a thing look like? What is 
“everything”? How can an “all-encompassing memory” be 
performed and recognized as such? What would it be 
good for? (Let us recall here Borges’s fictional character 
Funes.) 

Complying with real-life memory experiences. A notion of as performed | Ondrej Beran 
 
 
 
23
As for the traumatic memory, let us consider what we 
call “memory” to be a segment of situated practice that has 
its “normalized” place and routinely fulfills or helps us fulfill-
ing various functions and tasks. If one’s performance of 
memory is loaded with traumatic content, what we can see 
here is a performance that seriously incapacitates, hurts, 
disadvantages its agent. “Past” plays such a role in the 
present performance of the agent, that it makes it unbear-
able (unsustainable) on a long-time scale. It is, in a sense, 
malfunctioning memory practice, because it fails to make a 
permanently sustainable sense of its holder’s existence 
(life) in time. (Malfunctioning does not consist in not re-
membering here; indicating that storing content might not 
be the essence of memory. Traumatic memories obstruct 
the present practice to be meaningful, with such memories 
of the past. Consider here also Ricoeur’s account of trau-
matisms of collective memory.) This is seen also in the fact 
that the therapy for PTSD does not consist in wiping-off the 
painful memories. The point is, to find such a model of 
working (dealing) with the memories that will provide a 
sustainable practice to the patient.  
To sum it up, Wittgenstein’s analyses allow us to make 
use of the valuable insights of phenomenology, but with 
keeping the importance of conceptual analysis as the es-
sential tool for interpreting and reflecting upon the experi-
ence of memory. “Memory” can be then understood as a 
conceptual description or foundation of various skills (both 
explicitly linguistic and not) that assume and thematize a 
temporal frame and the past.

Grundlose Gewissheit und Absolutes Wissen – Wittgenstein und 
Hegel 
Alexander Berg 
Dresden, Deutschland | Alexander.Berg@mailbox.tu-dresden.de  
Abstract 
Die Arbeit unternimmt den Versuch, die Gewissheitskonzeption des späten Wittgenstein in die Nähe derjenigen Konzeption zu 
denken, die Hegel in der Phänomenologie des Geistes für die Selbstgewissheit des Geistes als Absolutes Wissen entwickelt 
hatte. Der gesuchte Zusammenhang wird am Beispiel eines von beiden Autoren in ihrer je eigenen Art erforschten 
philosophischen Problems untersucht und zwar an dem des sogenannten Cartesischen Dualismus. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die 
methodischen Problemzugriffe Wittgensteins und Hegels nicht einfach nur verschieden sind, sondern, dass sie sich in ihrer 
eigentümlichen Gegensätzlichkeit als aufeinander bezogen darstellen lassen. Die Untersuchung der Form dieses Gegensatzes 
lässt vermuten, dass die Bemühung beider Autoren, den bewusstseinsphilosophischen Dualismus zu überwinden zugleich auch 
der Grund ist für die besondere Verwandtschaft ihrer Konzeptionen, der Grundlosen Gewissheit und des Absoluten Wissens. 
 
 
Dieser Text geht der Frage nach, ob sich das Konzept der 
Grundlosen Gewissheit in der Spätphilosophie Wittgen-
steins mit dem Konzept des Absoluten Wissens in der 
Phänomenologie des Geistes von G. W. F. Hegel, im Hin-
blick auf die angezielte Überwindung des Cartesischen 
Dualismus der Bewusstseinsphilosophie zusammenden-
ken lassen.  
Charakteristisch für Wittgensteins Ansatz ist es, dass er 
gar nicht erst versucht – wie die Tradition es zumeist getan 
hat –, das Leib-Seele-Verhältnis als philosophisches Prob-
lem zu lösen und so zu sagen, was die Seele und der Leib 
seien. Stattdessen sollen die Probleme „im eigentlichen 
Sinne“ aufgelöst werden, „wie ein Stück Zucker im Was-
ser“ (BTS: 284, 3.217.1.1). Daher muss über Unsagbares 
nach Wittgenstein bekanntlich geschwiegen werden (Vgl. 
LPA: 7). Sein Ansatz besteht vielmehr darin das Problem 
sprachkritisch zu hintergehen, d. h. zunächst die Frage zu 
stellen, wie es überhaupt „zum philosophischen Problem 
der seelischen Vorgänge“ kommt (PU § 308). „Wo unsere 
Sprache uns einen Körper vermuten läßt, und kein Körper 
ist, dort, möchten wir sagen, sei ein Geist“ (PU § 36). 
Durch eine bestimmte Art, Fragen zu stellen entsteht also 
erst die philosophische Problematik des Leib-Seele-
Verhältnisses – mit der Frage: „Und wie kann ein Körper 
eine Seele haben?“ (PU § 283). Dagegen will die Sprach-
kritik Wittgensteins zeigen, dass die Metaphysik irrtümlich 
Aussagen über mentale Rede – also Sätze der Grammatik 
– als Aussagen über die Wirklichkeit einer psychischen 
Welt im Gegensatz zu einer davon sehr verschieden vor-
gestellten physischen Welt verstanden hat.  
Damit wendet er sich vor allem gegen eine Bewusst-
seinsphilosophie, die einen geistigen Akt des Meinens vor 
dem bedeutungsvollen Sprechen, d. h. des Wollens vor 
dem sinnhaften Handeln annimmt. Seine Analysen versu-
chen aufzuzeigen, dass diese unbeobachtbaren Akte je-
weils nur ontologische Hypostasierungen sinnvoller und 
alltäglich gebräuchlicher Wortverwendungen sind (vgl. PU 
§§ 613–615). Das dualistische Bild des Handelns als ei-
nerseits aus leiblichem Operieren und andererseits aus 
innerlichem Intendieren bestehend soll als irreführend er-
kennbar werden. Da Wittgenstein so das cartesische ego 
cogito durch transzendentale Sprachkritik überwunden zu 
haben meint, weist er jede metaphysisch begründete Pri-
vatheit des Subjekts mit den folgenden Worten zurück: 
„Das denkende, vorstellende Subjekt gibt es nicht.“ (LPA: 
5.631) 
Wittgensteins methodischer Zugriff auf das Leib-Seele-
Problem lässt sich vorerst dahingehend zusammenfassen, 
dass er die Frage danach, was die Seele bzw. was der 
Leib sei nicht mehr stellt, ja dieses philosophische Problem 
insgesamt als das Ergebnis einer missbräuchlichen 
Sprachverwendung auffasst und ihm ein vielschichtig 
komplexes Bedeutungsgefüge gegenüberstellt, innerhalb 
dessen die Begriffe Seele und Leib ihre Verwendung in 
nun mannigfaltigen alltäglichen Sprachspielen finden. Die 
mannigfachen philosophischen Sprachspiele selbst wer-
den nach dem Schweigegebot des frühen Wittgenstein als 
eigene Form wieder schrittweise mit Alltagssprache und 
Lebenswelt verbunden. Die Philosophischen Untersu-
chungen sehen deren Platz im Leerlauf der Sprache, wenn 
diese nicht arbeitet (Vgl. PU § 132), sozusagen am Feier-
abend (Vgl. PU § 38). Und wenige Wochen vor seinem 
Tod, kann Wittgenstein im Garten sitzend philosophieren 
und einem Passanten zurufen: „Dieser Mensch ist nicht 
verrückt: Wir philosophieren nur.“ (ÜG § 467) 
Gleich Wittgenstein, der die spezifisch ontologische Dif-
ferenz von Körper und Geist durch die irreführende 
Grammatik der Sprache verwischt sieht, kritisiert auch He-
gel die fehlerhafte Fragestellung der alten Metaphysik, die 
im Leib-Seele-Verhältnis fälschlicherweise Immaterielles 
und Materielles einander gegenüberstellt wie das Beson-
dere dem Besonderen (Vgl. E III §§ 388). In der Phäno-
menologie des Geistes heißt es dazu: „Wenn Ich Seele 
genannt wird, so ist es zwar auch als Ding vorgestellt, aber 
als ein unsichtbares, unfühlbares usf., in der Tat also nicht 
als unmittelbares Sein und nicht als das, was man unter 
einem Dinge meint.“ (PhG: 577). Dagegen kann er aber 
gerade an Descartes’ cogito ergo sum sowohl die Diffe-
renzierung als auch das Moment der Einheit von Denken 
und Sein oder von Geist und Körper oder von Seele und 
Leib würdigen als den „wahrhaften Anfang der modernen 
Philosophie, insofern sie das Denken zum Prinzip macht“ 
(GP III: 123). Das gelingt ihm vor allem deshalb, weil er 
das Leib-Seele-Problem anhand des cogito in zwei Teil-
probleme differenziert. Das erste ist die Unterscheidung in 
Bezug auf den jeweiligen Status von Denken und Sein, die 
in der klassischen Philosophie – hier bestätigt Hegel Witt-
genstein – noch nicht bekannt war. (Vgl. GP III: 454) Zum 
Unterschied gehört aber auch die Einheit als wesentliche 
Einsicht Descartes’. Im cogito ergo sum heißt es schließ-
lich: ich denke und ich bin. Denken und Sein sind hier ver-
bunden im Ich. Das zweite Teilproblem, das Hegel nun in 
Bezug auf das cogito ausmacht ist die philosophiege-
schichtlich sich als äußerst problematisch darstellende

Form dieser Einheit. Descartes selbst hatte sich damit be-
gnügt, an die Stelle der Vermittlung von Denken und Sein 
Gott zu setzen. Dagegen fordert Hegel, diese Vermittlung 
aus dem „Begriff der Einheit […] beider Glieder“ (GP III: 
157) zu gewinnen, wobei diese Glieder selbst wieder als 
„Begriff“ (ebd.) – d. h. als Einheit – aufzufassen sind. 
(Wittgenstein fordert ganz ähnliches, wenn er verlangt: 
„Die Dinge müssen sich direkt miteinander verbinden, oh-
ne Seil, d. h. sie müssen schon in Verbindung miteinander 
stehen …“ (WK: 155)  
Wichtig ist dabei, dass Hegel gleich Wittgenstein den 
falsch verstandenen Dualismus im Leib-Seele-Verhältnis 
aufzulösen versucht. Anders als Wittgenstein aber, der 
dieses sprachlich abgründige Unterfangen ablehnt – als 
etwas, dass sich eben nicht sagen, sondern allenfalls zei-
gen lässt (LPA § 6.522; § 4.1212; § 4.115) – macht Hegel 
hier ein beherztes Angebot, das nicht leicht zu verstehen 
ist, da es begrifflich die gesamte Phänomenologie des 
Geistes von der sinnlichen Gewissheit bis zur Gewissheit 
des absoluten Wissens im Hintergrund hat. In seiner Ter-
minologie stellt sich das Leben im Fortgehen des Begriffs 
als die Idee im Moment der Unmittelbarkeit dar (vgl. EI § 
216: 373 f.). Die Seele ist hier die Totalität des Begriffs als 
ideelle Einheit, während ihr gegliederter Leib dieselbe To-
talität als sinnliches Auseinander ist.  
„Beide nämlich sind nicht Unterschiedene, welche zu-
sammenkommen, sondern ein und dieselbe Totalität der-
selben Bestimmungen“ (ÄI: 161). In Hegels Sprache kann 
also etwas (die Seele) eine Totalität, d. h. eine Ganzheit 
sein, das zusammen mit seinem Gegenteil (dem Leib) als 
Ganzheit auch dieselbe Ganzheit ist. Diese Aussage ist 
offensichtlich in mehrere Richtungen widersprüchlich. 
Nachvollziehbar wird sie aber dann, wenn man sie als 
spekulativen Satz versteht, als eine Art bewusst wider-
sprüchliche Redeweise Hegels, bei der im Unterschied 
zum analytischen Satz die gleichzeitige Identität und Nicht-
identität von Subjekt und Objekt vorgestellt wird (vgl. PG: 
61). Das „Spekulative“ ist dabei die positive Seite des He-
gel’schen Vernunftdenkens. Es eröffnet „die Einheit der 
Bestimmungen […], das Affirmative, das in ihrer Auflösung 
und ihrem Übergehen enthalten ist“ (EI: 175). 
Hier zeigen sich schon deutlich die sehr verschiedenen 
Zugriffe der beiden Autoren auf das Leib-Seele-Problem: 
Wo Wittgenstein mit skeptischen Argumenten darauf 
dringt, nur das zu sagen was sich klar sagen lässt und 
über den Rest Schweigen verlangt (vgl. LPA § 7), setzt 
Hegel die bewusste Widersprüchlichkeit des spekulativen 
Satzes und wo Wittgensteins eigener Skeptizismus analy-
tisch deskriptiv die Komplexität, Widersprüchlichkeit und 
Unabgeschlossenheit der uns an der Oberfläche so ver-
traut scheinenden Alltagssprache aufzeigt, findet Hegel 
phänomenologisch konstruktiv in der gleichen Alltagsspra-
che das spekulative Potenzial für seine dialektisch auf Ge-
samtheit der denkmöglichen Differenzierungen gerichteten 
philosophischen Weltorientierung.  
An den gegensätzlichen Zugriffen Wittgensteins und 
Hegels auf die ausgewählten philosophischen Problem-
stellungen kann in einem dritten Schritt gezeigt werden, 
dass sie gleichsam von verschiedenen Seiten auf den 
Fluchtpunkt einer in den wesentlichen Zügen gemeinsam 
geteilten Grundorientierung konvergieren. Wittgenstein 
selbst, sagt dazu 1948 gegenüber Maurice O’Connor Dru-
ry: „Mir scheint, Hegel will immer sagen, daß Dinge, die 
verschieden aussehen, in Wirklichkeit gleich sind, während 
es mir um den Nachweis geht, daß Dinge, die gleich aus-
sehen, in Wirklichkeit verschieden sind.“ (Monk 1992: 567 
f.).  
Wo also Wittgenstein über einen auf sich selbst ange-
wendeten Skeptizismus d. i. ein Nichtwissen des Nichtwis-
sens, zur Einsicht in die lebenstragende Bedingung einer 
grundlosen Gewissheit findet, geht Hegel den entgegen-
gesetzten Weg über das Sich-selbst-Wissen des Wissens 
zum absoluten Wissen als Wahrheit in der „Gestalt der 
Gewißheit seiner selbst“ (PhG: 582). Um dies weiter zu 
verdeutlichen, muss das Konzept der grundlosen Gewiss-
heit Wittgensteins und das des absoluten Wissens Hegels 
genauer charakterisiert werden. Negativ nähert sich Witt-
genstein dem Konzept der grundlosen Gewissheit (Vgl. 
Rentsch 2003: 330 f.) über die verschiedenen Stufen eines 
sich immer weiter radikalisierenden Skeptizismus – zuerst 
über die Unsagbarkeit im Traktatus (Vgl. LPA § 6.51), 
dann über die Unabschließbarkeit sprachlicher Bestim-
mung in den Philosophischen Untersuchungen – und fin-
det sodann in Über Gewissheit zu einer in praktischer Ur-
teilskraft fundierten grundlosen Gewissheit. Wittgenstein 
lässt sich philosophisch so weder einfach als Skeptiker 
noch als Antiskeptiker bezeichnen. (Vgl. Pritchard 2011: 
522 f.) Vielmehr ist der Fluchtpunkt seines philosophischen 
Denkens die offen gehaltene Selbstanwendung seines 
gesamten Skeptizismus. Offen ist sie zum einen deshalb, 
weil nicht nur – wie bei Descartes – das punktförmige das 
des Zweifels für philosophische Gewissheit bürgt – in dem 
Sinne, dass ich zwar sinnvoll an allem zweifeln kann, aber 
nicht daran, dass ich zweifle – und zum anderen deshalb, 
weil der Holismus der Lebenspraxis, in den auch die philo-
sophische Skepsis eingebettet ist, nicht mehr sinnvoll als 
Ganzes bezweifelt werden kann. (Vgl. ÜG § 354) „Das 
Spiel des Zweifels setzt schon die Gewißheit voraus.“ (ÜG 
§ 115). Die Offenheit oder Grundlosigkeit der Gewissheit 
bedeutet zum anderen aber auch, dass das Ganze der 
Weltorientierung nicht theoretisch abgeschlossen ist. So 
wie sich jeder einzelne Stein im Fundament meiner Über-
zeugungen in irgendeinem Moment als nicht mehr tragend 
erweisen kann, kann sich auch der ganze Kontext dessen 
verschieben, was ich für die Grundlage meiner praktischen 
Gewissheiten halten würde. Wittgenstein verwendet hierfür 
das Bild eines Flussbettes, dessen Grund widerstandsfä-
higer, also gewisser ist als das Wasser, das in ihm fließt – 
aber auch „das Flußbett der Gedanken [kann] sich ver-
schieben“ (ÜG §§ 94–97). Der Grund des Flussbettes ist in 
dem Sinne grundlos, in dem mit der Zeit – durch Verschie-
bung der Grenzen des Flussbettes – feste Bereiche sich 
verflüssigen und flüssige erstarren. Der Grund des Fluss-
bettes ist gegen das Wasser relativ fest und wird doch von 
ihm geformt: „ […] ich unterscheide zwischen der Bewe-
gung des Wassers im Flußbett und der Verschiebung die-
ses; obwohl es eine scharfe Trennung der beiden nicht 
gibt“ (ÜG § 97). 
Es kann also vermutet werden, dass Hegel sich dem 
Leib-Seele-Problem zwar mit der gleichen Intention, aber 
von genau der entgegengesetzten Seite annähert als Witt-
genstein. Die Gemeinsamkeit zwischen beiden besteht in 
der angezielten Überwindung des Dualismus. An die Stelle 
der Wittgenstein’schen Methode des „beredten“ Schwei-
gens setzt Hegel aber den spekulativen Satz (Vgl. Wohl-
fahrt 1981), der sich grob charakterisieren lässt als eine 
Methode des bewusst widersprüchlichen oder nach Witt-
genstein unsinnigen Sprechens – oder, wie er auch in Ge-
sprächen des Wiener Kreises Augustinus zitiert: „Rede nur 
einen Unsinn, es macht nichts!“ (WK 68 f.).  
Über die Form der spekulativen Rede öffnet Hegel sys-
tematisch und differenziert denjenigen Dualismus, den die 
Logik einer falsch verstandenen Sprache nahelegt. Die 
methodisch verschiedenen Formen der Überwindung des 
Dualismus gleichen sich in ihrem konzeptionellen Inhalt. 
Wie das der grundlosen Gewissheit ist das Konzept des

 26
absoluten Wissens über seine Offenheit und zugleich aber 
auch Vollständigkeit charakterisiert. Vollständigkeit besagt 
dabei aber nicht, dass das Wissen etwa absolut losgelöst 
von einer kulturell angesammelten Erfahrung sei und ab-
geschlossen gegen Zukünftiges, sondern Absolutheit 
meint gerade die vollständige Offenheit des Wissens. (Vgl. 
Jaeschke 2001: 286 f.) 
Im Ergebnis lässt sich also feststellen: wie bei der Unter-
scheidung in dem Wittgenstein’schen Bild des Flussbettes 
der Gedanken zwischen dem in einer Lebensform einge-
betteten Gedankenstrom und seinem gewussten Grund, 
die es als scharfe Trennung nicht gibt (ÜG § 97) ist auch 
das absolute Wissen nur möglich in der Vereinigung und 
Anerkennung seiner beiden Voraussetzungen: des Ziels 
des Absoluten und der Tatsächlichkeit der Entzweiung

Huemer's Phenomenal Conservatism, Markie's objections and 
Husserl's input 
Philipp Berghofer 
Graz, Austria | philipp.berghofer@edu.uni-graz.at 
Abstract 
Huemer's Principle of Phenomenal Conservatism (PC) states that every seeming is a source of prima facie justification. 
Arguably, the most common objection against PC consists in referring to counterexamples. This sort of objection has particularly 
been championed by Markie (2005). In order to meet Markie's objection, a dogmatist could endorse a restricted version of PC. 
Here, a dogmatist is one who believes that at least one kind of seeming is a source of prima facie justification. This paper aims 
to show that a dogmatist could benefit from replacing Huemer's seemings with Husserl's phenomenological intuitions as being 
the ultimate source of prima facie justification. 
 
 
1. Huemer's seemings 
According to Huemer's Principle of Phenomenal Conserva-
tism, prima facie justification for beliefs concerning the ex-
ternal world, the inner world, mathematics, ethics and so 
forth, is easily accessible. 
PC “If it seems to S that p, then, in the absence of de-
featers, S thereby has at least some degree of justifica-
tion for believing that p.” (Huemer 2007, 30) 
I will use the term “prima facie justification” in such a way 
that allows phrasing PC as follows: every seeming that p 
confers prima facie justification on belief in p. Evidently, 
PC is a bold thesis entailing far-reaching consequences. 
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that there has been a 
lot of criticism. Conversely, there have been various at-
tempts to make PC plausible. Huemer's main argument, 
namely his self-defeat argument, states that the denial of 
PC results in self-defeat. Another way to argue in favor of 
PC is to stress its explanatory power (cf. Tucker 2010). 
In this paper, I want to focus on the probably most rele-
vant objection against PC that simply states that there are 
counterexamples to PC. A counterexample to PC is an 
example in which seemings occur that cannot rationally be 
regarded as a source of (prima facie) justification. Markie 
(2005) is arguably the most important proponent of this 
sort of objection against PC. According to Markie and 
many others, PC is too liberal. They think it is a mistake to 
assert that all seemings are a source of prima facie justifi-
cation and they do so because they think there are obvi-
ous counterexamples. An elaboration on this issue is to be 
found in section 3.  
Now let us focus more closely on Huemer's seemings. 
There is some agreement among Phenomenal Conserva-
tives that seemings are sui generis propositional entities 
(cf. e.g. Huemer 2007 and Tucker 2010). Sui generis 
means that seemings are irreducible. They especially can-
not be reduced to beliefs or inclinations to believe. The 
distinctive feature of seemings is that they present their 
contents as true. “The real difference between seemings 
and other states that can incline one to believe their con-
tents is that seemings have the feel of truth, the feel of a 
state whose content reveals how things really are.” (Tol-
hurst 1998, 298-299) In this context Huemer uses the term 
“forcefulness”, whereas Tucker prefers “assertiveness”.  
The four most important types of seemings are: Percep-
tual seemings, introspective seemings, memory-related 
seemings and intellectual seemings. When I, for instance, 
raise my eyes, there seem to be people in front of me lis-
tening carefully. This is a perceptual seeming. The alleged 
problem is that there are seemings that cannot confer 
prima facie justification on beliefs. If my seeming that p is, 
for example, solely caused by my desire that p, this seem-
ing does not seem to have any justificatory force. A mere 
desire cannot render a belief justified. Therefore, if we al-
low for the possibility that seemings can be caused solely 
by desires, the whole theory of PC might be endangered. 
Now let us turn our attention to Husserl's notion of intuition. 
2. Husserl's phenomenological intuitions 
In his sixth logical investigation, Husserl makes the crucial 
distinction between signitive and intuitive acts. A signitive 
is an empty, and an intuitive is a fulfilling act. If a signitive 
act is fulfilled, it is fulfilled intuitively by an intuitive act. In-
tuitive acts are termed “Intuitionen” or “Anschauungen”. I 
will use the term “phenomenological intuitions” to mark the 
difference to the contemporary usage of the term “intui-
tions”. Phenomenological intuitions refer to a mode of 
givenness. The same object can be given signitively or 
intuitively. In the first case we have a linguistic understand-
ing, a mere concept of the object. In the second case the 
object is “bodily present”, is given in a “fleshed out” man-
ner. To be intuitively given is termed “anschaulich gegeben 
sein”.  
Attention should be paid to the fact that Husserl uses “in-
tuitively given” in a very broad sense. It is physical objects 
as well as ideal objects that can be given intuitively, that 
can be “bodily present”. For instance, when I see my black 
laptop standing in front of me, I have a perceptual intuition. 
I see the laptop and its color with my eyes. Likewise, in 
some manner, I can “see” that “1 + 1 = 2”. The truth of this 
proposition is given intuitively. Phenomenological intuitions 
play a fundamental role within Husserl's phenomenology. 
“Immediate 'seeing', not merely sensous, experiential see-
ing, but seeing in the universal sense as an originally pre-
sentive consciousness of any kind whatever, is the ulti-
mate legitimizing source of all rational assertions.” (Husserl 
1983, 36) In his “Principle of All Principles” (Husserl 1983, 
§ 24) Husserl reinforces the importance of phenomenol-
ogical intuitions. 
Considering that Husserl, on the one hand, views phe-
nomenological intuitions to be the ultimate source of justifi-
cation and, on the other hand, stresses their fallibility (cf. 
Husserl 1983, 36) we can call him a moderate foundation-
alist. Many evident similarities can be drawn to Huemer's 
PC. Husserl's phenomenological intuitions as well as 
Huemer's seemings are fallible justifying entities, each

situated at the core of their philosophical system. Accord-
ing to Husserl and Huemer neither phenomenological intui-
tions, nor seemings are in need of meta-justification. A fur-
ther similarity consists in the fact that different kinds of ob-
jects (e.g., physical objects, mathematical objects) lead to 
different kinds of phenomenological intuitions or, respec-
tively, different kinds of seemings. Especially important is 
the similar phenomenological characterization of seemings 
and phenomenological intuitions. As mentioned, the former 
are characterized as having “the feel of truth”. According to 
Husserl evidence – in Husserl's epistemology “evidence” 
and “intuition” are closely related - is “the experience of 
truth”. This does not mean that what is experienced is ob-
jectively true. Such an interpretation is incompatible with 
Husserl's fallibilism. What Husserl wants to point out is that 
every evidence – just like every seeming -  presents its 
contents as true.  
Let us turn our attention away from the similarities to one 
main difference. Phenomenological intuitions do not only 
present their contents as true, but also their objects as 
bodily present. Heffernan outlines: “Evidence is both 'the 
experience of the truth' and 'the intentional achievement of 
self-givenness'.” (Heffernan 1998, 59) It is a necessary 
feature of phenomenological intuitions that their objects 
are given in a fleshed out manner. For a seeming, on the 
other hand, it seems to be sufficient that it presents its con-
tents as true. Therefore, we state that every phenomenol-
ogical intuition is a seeming, but not every seeming is a 
phenomenological intuition. Let us exemplify this: It 
strongly seems to me, e. g., that my laptop is black. If this 
seeming is only some kind of a feeling and is not based on 
anything intuitively given, then this seeming cannot be a 
phenomenological intuition. This difference does not de-
pend on the “forcefulness” of the seeming. It might seem to 
me that my laptop necessarily has to be black. Nonethe-
less, as long as this seeming is not some kind of percep-
tion or based on any perception, this seeming cannot be 
considered a phenomenological intuition.  
A seeming is a phenomenological intuition only if I can 
“see” its contents. On several occasions Husserl stresses 
that feelings of evidence do not exist (cf. e.g. Husserl 
1983, 39-40). One might have feelings of certainty, but 
these feelings have no justificatory power (cf. Husserl 
1984, 153-156). Claiming the opposite is for Husserl a 
psychologistic mistake that directly leads to relativism. 
What about Huemer's PC? Since there might be seemings 
that are nothing but mere feelings (e. g., desires), one 
could raise the objection that according to Huemer's PC, 
feelings are the ultimate source of justification. If this ob-
jection is true, is this really a problem? Consider the follow-
ing scenario: It strongly seems to me that my new neighbor 
N is a really bad person. This attitude is not justified or 
caused by N's behavior. I never had any bad experience 
with N. Nevertheless, there is this seeming. If I was asked 
why I deem N to be a bad person, I could only refer to the 
fact that N seems to me to be a bad person. There might 
be a psychological reason for this seeming. Maybe some-
thing about N subconsciously reminds me of a person I 
dislike. The point is that in cases like this, we have the 
strong intuition that such a seeming should not count as 
prima facie justification.  
 
According to Husserl such a seeming is indeed no justi-
fier, as it does not present anything in an intuitive manner. 
Huemer, however, seems to be committed to the view that 
seemings like this are a source of prima facie justification 
as well. This means that he is committed to a view that is 
counterintuitive. In the next section, we will discuss two 
examples given by Markie, which are generally considered 
as strong evidence against PC. We will come to the con-
clusion that one of these two examples is a problem solely 
for Huemer, but not for Husserl, since examples of this 
kind make use of seemings that have no intuitive contents. 
Markie's other example poses a problem for both Huemer 
and Husserl. The cogency of this example depends on the 
assumption that sources of non-inferential justification 
must not be caused inappropriately. Following Tucker 
(2010) I will argue that there are good reasons to resist this 
assumption. 
3. Markie's counterexamples and Husserl's 
advantages 
Markie (2005) gives two influential counterexamples 
against PC. Due to strategic reasons, I will begin with dis-
cussing his second example. 
Cognitive malfunction:  
„Suppose that I perceive the walnut tree in my yard, 
and, having learned to identify walnut trees visually, it 
seems to me that it is a walnut tree. The same phe-
nomenological experience that makes it seem to me 
that the tree is a walnut also makes it seem to me that it 
was planted on April 24, 1914. Nothing in the phe-
nomenological experience or my identification skills 
supports things seeming this way to me. There is no 
date-of-planting sign on the tree, for example. Cognitive 
malfunction is the cause of its seeming to me in percep-
tion that the tree was planted on that date.“ (Markie 
2005, 357) 
It is important to notice that my visual experience of that 
walnut tree may cause my date-of-planting seeming, but 
the property of being planted on a specific date is not 
given intuitively. I have a visual experience, and the prop-
erty of being planted on a specific date, is not a visual 
property. In this example a cognitive malfunction is the 
reason for the occurrence of a seeming that lacks any in-
tuitive contents. If we allow for the possibility that cognitive 
malfunctions may cause such seemings, then Huemer's 
PC seems to be in real trouble. As I believe it is impossible 
to exclude this possibility, I think that this sort of objection 
is a serious threat to PC. It is, however, no threat to 
Husserl. Examples like this rely on the existence of justifi-
catorily impotent seemings that lack any intuitive contents. 
Such seemings are not phenomenological intuitions, so 
there is no problem for Husserl. Let us turn to Markie's 
other example.  
Wishful thinking:  
„Suppose that we are prospecting for gold. You have 
learned to identify a gold nugget on sight but I have no 
such knowledge. As the water washes out of my pan, 
we both look at a pebble, which is in fact a gold nugget. 
My desire to discover gold makes it seem to me as if 
the pebble is gold; your learned identification skills 
make it seem that way to you. According to (PC), the 
belief that it is gold has prima facie justification for both 
of us.“ (Markie 2005, 357) 
In this case, the problematic seeming has intuitive con-
tents. Markie “sees” a gold nugget. Surely, the yellow peb-
ble in front of him just “accidentally” happens to be a gold 
nugget, but Markie's seeming presents its contents in a 
fleshed out manner, so this seeming is a phenomenologi-
cal intuition. Therefore, this example poses a problem for 
Huemer and for Husserl. A problem arises because the 
seeming in question is caused inappropriately. The ques-

Huemer's Phenomenal Conservatism, Markie's objections and Husserl's input | Philipp Berghofer 
 
 
 
29
tion to be solved is, whether we should disallow such 
seemings as a source of justification merely because they 
are caused inappropriately. I think we should not. If we did 
so, we would commit ourselves to a strong form of exter-
nalism that faces its own serious problems. 
Tucker's line of reasoning is as follows. Suppose there is 
an evil demon that likes to deceive us. Philosophers gen-
erally agree that even in the case where you are a demon-
victim, you are justified in trusting your perceptions. If you 
see a human being in front of you, believing that there is a 
human being is an “appropriate response” to this percep-
tion, and so your belief is justified. However, in such cases 
your experience is caused in an inappropriate manner. To 
be caused inappropriately, therefore, cannot be a sufficient 
reason to disqualify a seeming as a source of prima facie 
justification. 
Let us summarize: There are many important similarities 
between Huemer's seemings and Husserl's phenomenol-
ogical intuitions. Nonetheless, not every seeming is a phe-
nomenological intuition, as the latter has to fulfill the re-
quirement to present its contents intuitively, meaning, in a 
fleshed out manner. This further requirement entails that 
some objections that pose serious problems for Huemer, 
are ineffective against Husserl. One example of this is 
Markie's “Cognitive malfunction” counterexample. One ob-
jection that can be raised against Huemer and Husserl is 
that seemings have to be produced appropriately in order 
to count as a source of justification. This claim, however, 
leads to counterintuitive results.

Was der Fall ist, der Tractatus  
Paulo Cesar Bezerra 
São Paulo, Brasil | bezerra.paulocesar@gmail.com  
Abstract 
“It used to be said that God could create everything, except what was contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not say 
of an “unlogical” world how it would look.” [TLP3.031]. Computer Engineering is a great example of a logical world, using Logic 
as the basic knowledge for almost all of their activities. This paper aims to show how much Tractatus is present in Computer 
Engineering. For this, explores its aphorisms in order to point one more way to deal with hardware and software projects, a help 
for those engineers that want to know more about the sources of knowledge that feed the Computer Engineering. Tractatus en-
ters in the computer world through the footnote attached to [TLP-1], in the first page, using a tree graph to number all apho-
risms. 
 
 
1. Description of the terms Tatsache, 
Sachverhalt and Elementarsatz  
 
The terms above have been interpreted differently by sev-
eral authors so, it is necessary to establish them for this 
paper: 
“The simplest proposition, the Elementarsatz, asserts 
the subsistence of a Sachverhaltes.” [TLP-4.21]  
Mrs. Teresa Iglesias-Rozas, in her dissertation submitted 
to the University of Oxford for the degree PhD, reports the 
following fact: - After having read Wittgenstein's Abhand-
lung for the first time, Russell wrote to Wittgenstein and, 
among other things, asked him;”What is the differences 
between Tatsache and Sachverhalt ?" To this Wittgenstein 
replied: "Sachverhalt is, what corresponds to an Elemen-
tarsatz if it is true. Tatsache is what corresponds to the 
logical product of elementary propositions when this prod-
uct is true. The reason why I introduce Tatsache before 
Sachverhalt would want a long explanation" (LR, p. 72) or 
(Notebooks, p.129, Letter to Russel, Cassino 19.8.19). 
These are the senses given to Elementarsatz, Sachver-
halt  and Tatsache for the whole of this work. In a logical 
circuit, Elementarsatz should correspond to an input sig-
nal; Sachverhalt as a input pin when the signal is high and, 
Tatsache as a set of at least two input pins in high state.  
2. Two worlds 
“The world is independent of my will.” [TLP-6.373], this is 
the world saw by Tractatus, extremely more complex than 
the “world is my will”, saw by an engineer when develops a 
project of digital circuit where everything has finite dimen-
sions. His will is to create and control a world, in which, a 
necessity for one thing to happen because another has 
happened exists, for logical necessity because, nobody “… 
creates a world in which certain propositions are true, then 
by that very act he also creates a world in which all the 
propositions that follow from them come true. And similarly 
he could not create a world in which the proposition ‘p’ was 
true without creating all its objects”. [TLP-5.123], in re-
sume: the engineer specifies and creates an artificial 
world, while Tractatus focuses an existing natural world.   
3. The application of logic 
“The application of logic decides what elementary-
propositions there are. What lies in the application logic 
cannot anticipate. It is clear that logic may not collide with 
its application. But logic must have contact with its applica-
tion. Therefore logic and its application may not overlap 
one another.” [TLP- 5.557].  “ If I cannot give elementary 
propositions a priori then it must lead to obvious nonsense 
to try to give them.” [TLP- 5.5571]. 
A tip to find all elementary propositions of a system is: 
“Every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a 
statement about their constituent parts, and into those 
propositions which completely describe the complexes.” 
[TLP-2.0201].   
“The specification of all true elementary propositions de-
scribes the world completely. The world is completely de-
scribed by the specification of all elementary propositions 
plus the specification, which of them are true and which 
false.”  [TLP- 4.26]. This implies that, while none of the 
elementary-propositions switches its truth-value, nothing 
happens in the world. The same is valid for any application 
(artificial world).  
4. Transition Delay 
Now raises a question. Which is the time necessary for an 
elementary-proposition switches its truth-value? The time 
scale is very large including billionths of second and bil-
lions of years, a transistor which turns on/off  or a star that 
doesn’t exists more, but its light continue arriving the earth. 
We will call this “transition delay”.  
It is not discussed explicitly the question about transition 
delay in Tractatus but, the two aphorisms below will be 
true if ,and only if, transition delay exists. 
“A function cannot be its own argument, but the result 
of an operation can be its own basis.” [TLP-5.251]. 
“Only in this way is the progress from term to term in a 
formal series possible (from type to type in the hierar-
chy of Russell and Whitehead). (Russell and Whitehead 
have not admitted the possibility of this progress but 
have made use of it all the same.)”.[TLP-5.252].

5. Sequential machines 
“The repeated application of an operation to its own result I 
call its successive application (“O’O’O’a” is the result of the 
threefold successive application of “O’ξ” to “a”). In a similar 
sense I speak of the successive application of several op-
erations to a number of propositions”. [TLP-5.2521] “The 
general term of the formal series a; O’a; O’O’a, … I write 
thus: “[a, x, O’x]”. This expression in brackets is a variable. 
The first term of the expression is the beginning of the for-
mal series, the second the form of an arbitrary term x of 
the series, and the third the form of that term of the series 
which immediately follows x. [TLP-5.2522]. The concept of 
the successive application of an operation is equivalent to 
the concept “and so on”. [TLP-5.2523]. 
Wittgenstein wrote in Notebooks, 21.11.16: - The con-
cept "and so on", symbolized by "...." is one of the most 
important of all and like all the others infinitely fundamen-
tal. For it alone justifies us in constructing logic and 
mathematics "so on" from the fundamental laws and primi-
tive signs. The "and so on" makes its appearance right 
away at the very beginning of the old logic when it is said 
that after the primitive signs have been given we can de-
velop one sign after another "so on". Without this concept 
we should be stuck at the primitive signs and could not go 
"on". The concept "and so on" and the concept of the op-
eration are equivalent. [Cf. 5.2523.] After the operation 
sign there follows the sign "...." which signifies that the re-
sult of the operation can in its turn be taken as the base of 
the operation; "and so on". 
We may reinforce the sentence “For it alone justifies us 
in constructing logic and mathematics "so on" from the 
fundamental laws and primitive signs.” , adding: if we had 
not developed the concept of successive application (“and 
so on”) of operations we would not have sequential ma-
chines, including the computer.  
It is not possible to talk about sequential machines in 
Tractatus forgetting [TLP-6], the famous Wittgenstein’s N-
operator, so discussed for several authors, Russell in-
cluded, that didn’t explained it well. On the other hand, the 
idea contained in [TLP-6] represents a concept used to 
develop algorithms for machines called “linear feedback 
shift register” used in electronic cryptography, for example.  
6. “… dem großen Spiegel”: 
“Wie kann die allumfassende, weltspiegelnde Logik so 
spezielle Haken und Manipulationen gebrauchen? Nur, 
indem sich alle diese zu einem unendlich feinen Netzwerk, 
zu dem großen Spiegel, verknüpfen.” [TLP-5.511]. 
What should be associated to “great mirror? We have to 
remember that when we put our left hand on a mirror, this 
hand touches the right hand of our inverted image, remind-
ing us the Kantian problem of the right and left hand 
[TLP6.3611] and, by this way, it is natural consider an 
analogy between an specular image and a negated propo-
sition. 
If we look at the schema in [TLP-4.31] referring to “p, q, 
r” we find the first four truth-possibilities negating the last 
four possibilities in the following order: (1-8), (2-7), (3-6) 
and (4-5). But, there is one more detail: the truth-
possibilities are ordered top-down in descending order in 
number of “T’s”.  
List L1, in sequence, refers to the set (p, q, r, s, t) of 
“Elementarsatz” in which; each element represents a truth-
possibility as in [TLP-4.31]. List L2 shows each element of 
L1 and its tautological complement, forming a list of pairs. 
It means: if is assigned true for the logical product of any-
one element of a pair then, the logical product of the nega-
tion of the other element of that pair, is also true. 
L1:  pqrst ; qrst, prst, pqst, pqrt, pqrs ; rst, qst, qrt, qrs, 
pst, prt, prs, pqt, pqs, pqr ; st, rt, rs, qt, qs, qr, pt, ps, pr, 
pq ; t, s, r, q, p ; Ø.   
List 2: (Ø, pqrst) ; (p, qrst),(q, prst), (r, pqst), (s,pqrt), (t, 
pqrs) ; (pq,rst), (pr,qst), (ps,qrt), (pt, qrs), (qr, pst) ; 
(qs,prt), (qt,prs), (rs,pqt), (rt, pqs), (st,pqr).  
To better understand the concept of tautological comple-
ment, choose, for example, the pair (rs, pqt) of List 2 and 
elect the logical product “rs” to be true. This implies the 
product (~p~q~t) to be also true, resulting the logical prod-
uct “rs~p~q~t” true. It is a tautology. Now, using the same 
reasoning, assign true for the logical product “pqt”, is  
found the logical product “pqt~r~s” be true. Concluding 
that “rs~p~q~t” = “pqt~r~s” and they are mirrored.  
7. “… einem unendlich feinen Netzwerk” 
A small world with thirty nine “Elementarsatze” has 2
39 = 
549.755.813.888 truth-possibilities of propositions, an 
embryo of the “großen Spiegel”. And about  “feinen Netz-
werk”? 
List L1 is organized in top-down order considering the 
number of elements in a logical produc. L1 fits well the 
nodes of a 5-cube (Penteract),in  a graph that is shown in 
the following address: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:5-
cube_graph.svg . For a 12-cube  (Dodekeract) the address 
is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:12-cube.svg .  
After visiting those addresses it is easy to understand 
why “…einem unendlich feinen Netzwerk”. But, is it all? 
No. There is a more important detail , that is: 
Applying the operation “or” in a pair of truth-possibilities 
with same number of “Elementarsatze” is found a truth-
possibility with one more “Elementarsatz”.  If we do the 
same in applying the operation “and” in a pair of truth-
possibilities with the same number of “Elementarsatze”, is 
found a truth-possibility with one “Elementarsatz” less. 
These properties cover almost all Boolean algebra. 
How could Wittgenstein see it all without the tools of 
Modern Algebra? 
8. About “N(ξA)" 
Because technical restriction in the source of characters, 
this paper uses “ξ
A ”meaning “all values of the propositional 
variable” “ξ” in place of that in Tractatus [TLP-5.502]. 
This passage is a “cornerstone” to understand [TLP-6]: 
Therefore I write instead of “(------T)(ξ,…….)”, “N(ξ
A)". 
“N(ξ
A)" is the negation of all the values of the propositional 
variable “ξ”. [TLP-5.502]. Pay attention, “N(ξ
A)" is the nega-
tion of all the values of the propositional variable “ξ”, a bit-
wise negation. List L1 was constructed by repeated appli-
cation of “N(ξ
A)” on elementary propositions, as shown be-
low. 
Before generate the elements of the List 1, consider a 
notation where Wp,q,r,s,t, is  some world defined for five 
“Elementarsatze”, generating an “ξ” with thirty two true-
possibilities; the signal “+” is used as union of two sets and 
“:=” says that the left side variable receives a new value 
after the right side expression is calculated.    

Was der Fall ist, der Tractatus | Paulo Cesar Bezerra 
 
 
 32
Repeat, ξ: = ξ + “N(ξ
A)” until the desired number of ”Ele-
mentarsatze”. 
Wp :  ξ: = { Ø,p}; 
Wpq:  N(ξ
A) = {pq,q} ;  ξ: = { Ø,p,pq,q}; 
Wpqr:  N(ξ
A) = {pqr,qr,r,pr} ; ξ: = { Ø,p,pq,q,pqr,qr,r,pr };     
Wpqrs: N(ξ
A) = {pqrs,qrs,rs,prs,s,ps,pqs,qs}; 
ξ: = { Ø,p,pq,q,pqr,qr,r,pr,pqrs,qrs,rs,prs,s,ps,pqs,qs };   
Wpqrst:  N(ξ
A) ={pqrst,qrst,rst,prst,st,pst,pqst,qst,t,pt,pqt,qt, 
pqrt,qrt,rt,prt}    
 ξ: = { Ø,p,pq,q,pqr,qr,r,pr,pqrs,qrs,rs,prs,s,ps,pqs,qs,pqrst, 
qrst,rst,prst,st,pst,pqst, qst,t,pt,pqt,qt,pqrt,qrt,rt,prt }; 
 
“... and so on” for more “Elementarsatze”.  
If you wish, sort "ξ" top-down or bottom-up, using the num-
ber of "Elementarsatze"  and get List 1. 
9. Integrated circuits 
The most popular technologies for integrated circuits are 
based 
on 
CMOS 
(Complementary 
 
Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor), a technology that meets the following 
characteristics: the circuits are divided in two parts sharing 
all input signals and the only one existing output signal; 
when electric current flows through one of the parts, 
through the other doesn't pass any electric current ; each 
part uses exclusively one type of transistor, p-channel or n-
channel (“p” and “n” referring to positive and negative 
charge, respectively); if an input signal is present on a p-
channel transistor and, at the same time,  on a n-channel 
transistor, the transistors react in a complementary form, it 
means: if one of them conducts current, the other doesn't 
conduct. 
The CMOS features listed above enable this technology 
to implement logic circuits that mirror the world through 
mirrored circuits. 
10. Note of the author 
I think that Wittgenstein was someone with differentiated 
knowledge compared with his colleagues. He saw what 
the others didn’t see; he created another way to see and 
analyze the world. Two decades after Tractatus is pub-
lished Claude Shannon proposed the use of Logic for de-
signing and simulation of logic circuits. Few years later, 
Garrett Birkhoff proposed the Lattice Theory, starting the 
Modern Algebra a booster for Computer Engineering. 
Tractatus is a great reference for those engineers that 
want to think better.

Displacing the Subject of Knowledge 
Johan Boberg  
Uppsala, Sweden | johan.boberg@filosofi.uu.se  
Abstract 
This paper examines Foucault’s attempt to displace the constitutive role of the subject of knowledge and to replace it with the 
concrete practices that constitute subjects. The prevalent tendency to transform discourse analysis into a new form of 
epistemology, here exemplified through the works of Paul Veyne, is criticized. It is suggested that Veyne’s reading of Foucault is 
subject to an illusion similar to what Kant once called “transcendental illusion,” and gives rise to a new form of metaphysics 
which repeats the problematic that Foucault originally aimed to overcome.  
 
 
In the wake of Kantian philosophy the modern dichotomy 
of subject and object stabilized, and the idea that knowl-
edge was founded upon the structure of “the subject of 
knowledge” became one of the central themes of nine-
teenth-century thought. This idea was absorbed into phe-
nomenology, which came to be understood by Husserl as 
a science describing the functioning of the transcendental 
subject in the constitution of the world. The twentieth cen-
tury has seen many attempts to displace this conception of 
the subject. This paper will examine Foucault’s attempt to 
replace the subject with concrete “practices” that constitute 
subjects. Furthermore, the prevalent tendency to transform 
discourse analysis into a new form of epistemology will be 
criticized. Paul Veyne’s works on Foucault will be used to 
exemplify this tendency, and it will be shown how his read-
ing gives rise to a new form of metaphysics which repeats 
the problematic that Foucault originally aimed to over-
come. 
In a late text, Foucault formulated three principles of 
method to summarize his approach to history. First, one 
should examine supposed anthropological universals as 
historical constructs. Second, instead of accounting for the 
possibility of knowledge of objects in terms of a constitutive 
subject, one should study the concrete practices in which 
subjects and objects “are formed and transformed” in rela-
tion to each other. Finally, one should address “practices” 
as the proper domain of analysis, where these practices 
are understood as “a way of acting and thinking at once, 
that provide the intelligibility key for the correlative constitu-
tion of the subject and the object.” (Foucault 1998: 462-3) 
Foucault had earlier described his way of proceeding as 
“regressive” in relation to the Kantian or Husserlian theme 
of the transcendental. He said that he tried “to assume a 
greater and greater detachment in order to define the his-
torical conditions and transformations of our knowledge. I 
try to historicize to the utmost in order to leave as little 
space as possible to the transcendental.” (Foucault 1996: 
99) In the Order of Things, he contrasts his approach to 
“the phenomenological approach,” asserting that “the his-
torical analysis of scientific discourse should, in the last 
resort, be subject, not to a theory of the knowing subject, 
but rather to a theory of discursive practice.” (Foucault 
1994: xiv) In The Archaeology of Knowledge, where he 
tried to elaborate his method, he wrote that he wanted to 
“define a method of historical analysis freed from the an-
thropological theme.” (Foucault 2006: 17) In speaking of 
anthropology here, he meant the idea that a historical 
analysis must in the last resort be grounded in a theory of 
“Man” understood as subject of knowledge, transcendental 
ego, etc. 
What he tried to formulate was a method for the analysis 
of discourse which would not aim to reduce or ground this 
discourse in a theory of the subject. Instead, he aimed to 
describe “discourses as practices obeying certain rules.” 
(ibid.: 155) In The Order of Things, he had described the 
regularity shared by natural history, economy and gram-
mar during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and 
how, at the turn of the nineteenth century, “the space of 
knowledge” came to be rearranged when biology, political 
economy and philology emerged, sharing a new form of 
regularity. Without knowing it, the naturalists, economists 
and grammarians used “the same rules to define the ob-
jects proper to their own study, to form their concepts, to 
build their theories.” (Foucault 1994: xi) The archeological 
method described the way in which specific scientific prac-
tices, by using historically specific rules, bring about “the 
formation of objects” and the formation of “a number of 
possible subjective positions.” This was not meant to expel 
the subject from the analysis, but “to define the positions 
and functions that the subject could occupy in the diversity 
of discourse.” (Foucault 2006: 78, 119, 221) 
We should pay close attention to the transformations that 
the categories of “subject” and “object” undergo here. In 
his attempt to displace the founding role of the subject of 
knowledge, Foucault retained the categories of subject 
and object as part of his methodological framework. In-
stead of aiming at a theory of the subject of knowledge in 
general Foucault described the specific subjective posi-
tions that are carved out in discursive practices. In the 
case of, for example, clinical medicine, the subjective posi-
tions are the whole group of functions of observation, inter-
rogation, deciphering that may be exercised by the subject 
of medical discourse. Objects of knowledge, to take exam-
ples from psychopathology, would be hallucinations, 
speech disorders, sexual aberrations, etc. (ibid.: 201, 45) 
Foucault’s methodology in a certain sense mirrors the 
structure of transcendental philosophy. But instead of at-
tempting a general exposition of the subject and object of 
knowledge, it studies specific forms of subjects and objects 
emerging within practices. They are brought down from the 
heights of philosophical abstraction, and discursive prac-
tices are said to provide “the space in which the subject 
may take up a position and speak of the objects with which 
he deals in his discourse.” (ibid.: 201) Foucault is clear that 
he is not offering a totalizing conception of historical analy-
sis, but rather one analytical approach among other possi-
ble ones. There is a prevalent tendency, though, among 
the readers of Foucault, to disengage the methodological 
framework of discourse analysis from the concrete histori-
cal analyses which it was designed to serve and transform 
it into a new form of universalist perspective. This will be 
exemplified here through the works of Paul Veyne. 
In Foucault Revolutionizes History, Veyne writes that he 
wants “to show the practical usefulness of Foucault’s 

Displacing the Subject of Knowledge | Johan Boberg 
 
 
 34
method.” (Veyne 1997: 146) Most significantly, Foucault is 
said to have shown how to overcome the belief in “natural 
objects” constant through history. Veyne starts by clarifying 
the distinctive character of Foucault’s method by means of 
examples but soon turns to the extraction of epistemologi-
cal consequences. The objects that we tend to fix our eyes 
on have but an apparent constancy through time, Veyne 
tells us. In reality, objects are always correlates of discur-
sive practices. Only in relation to a specific, historically de-
termined, practice can something be said to “be” in a cer-
tain way. In abstraction from such a practice, we have but 
empty words. 
Objects seem to determine our behavior, but our prac-
tice determines its own objects in the first place. Let us 
start, then, with that practice itself, so that the object to 
which it applies is what it is only in relation to that prac-
tice […]. The relation determines the object, and only 
what is determined exists. (ibid.: 155) 
When we historicize our objects, we realize that they were 
only objects in relation to a practice that “objectifies” them,
 
and the same applies to the subject: “consciousness is not 
constitutive but constituted.” (ibid.: 159, 176) While this 
does not entail that there is nothing beyond discourse, 
Veyne is quick to add, the “prediscursive” referents are not 
“natural objects,” but pure potentiality. We have a “wholly 
material universe, made up of prediscursive referents that 
remain faceless potentialities.” (ibid.: 171) Materiality lacks, 
in abstraction from concrete practices, all determination. 
Only through a practice that actualizes this potentiality do 
“objects” and “subjects” appear. 
In a more recent work, Veyne describes what he calls “a 
tacit metaphysical sensitivity” characterizing Foucault’s 
view of history: that everything we think we know is limited 
and we cannot even see these limits. And are unaware of 
their existence. 
[W]e are constantly confined by a fishbowl whose con-
taining sides we cannot even see. Given that “dis-
course” cannot be sidestepped, even if we are particu-
larly fortunate, we cannot perceive the true truth or 
even a future truth, or what purports to be one. […] 
[W]e can escape from our provisional fishbowl […]. 
However, even then, we shall leave one fishbowl only 
to find ourselves trapped in a new one. (Veyne 2010: 
27-8) 
In Veyne’s reading we see the detachment of analytical 
categories from historical analysis. The conceptual frame-
work is treated as the true philosophical content and the 
empirical analysis become but a way of exemplifying the 
general mechanics of history. A new epistemology is de-
veloped, founded this time not upon a constitutive subject, 
but upon practices that bring forth subjects and objects. 
This provokes the question: how, exactly, are we to under-
stand Foucault’s move to the study of the concrete prac-
tices through which subjects and objects are “constituted?” 
At times Foucault compared his approach to that of ordi-
nary language philosophy. Whereas these philosophers 
would conduct “a critical analysis of thought on the basis of 
the way in which one says things,” Foucault said he 
wanted to pursue a similar line of research within a “more 
genuine historical context.” (Davidson 1997: 3-5) In such 
an approach, instead of an analysis of the essence of, say, 
“naming,” treating it as a universal of language, one would 
describe the different linguistic practices of naming: of giv-
ing something a name, of calling someone by name, of 
telling someone one’s name, etc. And this description of 
the “grammar” of the concept, and the clarification of phi-
losophical problems arising out of it, would constitute the 
true philosophical content, not a “theory” of how linguistic 
actions are always constituted by “language games.” 
The analysis of subjects constituted by practices, as a 
“regressive” move, I would suggest, should be understood 
as a rejection of all talk of the position of the subject in 
general. Just as one should be sensitive to the minute dif-
ferences in practices of naming, and not assume a com-
mon shared essence, so should “subjective positions” al-
ways be understood in relation to a “genuine historical 
context”: specific ways of observing, deciphering or re-
cording. Speaking of “constitution” here might mislead. The 
point would be that it is only within a specific way of think-
ing and acting that talk of “subjective positions” can be 
made sense of at all. 
The claustrophobic vision presented by Veyne, of man 
as “confined” within limiting discourses, is a product of his 
focusing on the conceptual framework rather than the 
analysis itself. Whereas it would make sense to say that 
someone is “limited” if she’s forced to use a specific vo-
cabulary in describing something, say using reproductive 
biology in describing human love, it doesn’t make sense to 
say that she’s limited because she has to use language. In 
order for the metaphor of “confinement” to make sense at 
all, someone needs to be prevented from doing something 
that could be done if the shackles were released. But what 
sense could be made of a freedom from language? 
Now someone might claim that all thought and all action 
necessarily occur within the strictures of a constitutive 
practice. What kind of claim would this be? It’s not an in-
sight into the nature of things, but rather an avowal of ad-
herence to the methodological framework of discourse 
analysis. And such a dogmatic privileging of a particular 
way of conceiving things certainly could be considered a 
“confinement” of thought. 
There seems to be a form of illusion at play in Veyne’s 
interpretation that shares certain traits with what Kant once 
called “transcendental illusion.” When we are deceived by 
transcendental illusion the conditions of knowledge are 
treated as sources of knowledge on their own, as providing 
a priori knowledge of “things in themselves.” Kant called 
this a transcendent use of the principles of knowledge, 
whereby one attempts to reach beyond the limits of possi-
ble experience, and distinguished this from an immanent, 
strictly empirical, use of principles (Kant 1998: A296/B352-
3). What we are dealing with in cases of transcendent use 
of principles, Kant wrote, is “a natural and unavoidable illu-
sion which itself rests on subjective principles and passes 
them off as objective.” (ibid.: A298/B354) 
Foucault saw the fate of the opening created by critical 
philosophy as ending in a new form of illusion, which he 
christened “anthropological illusion,” that is, the illusion 
wherein the conditions of knowledge are again projected: 
this time, not unto the world, but back into the being of 
Man. It was this idea of Man that he wanted to break free 
from by turning to practices. But in Veyne’s interpretation 
we witness the emergence of a similar form of illusion. We 
see once again a transcendent use of methodological 
principles: they are released from empirical use and 
treated as providing insight into the very nature of human 
thought and action as such. The emptiness of the catego-
ries of subject and object is interpreted as a metaphysical 
insight into the nature of an entity called “discursive prac-
tice” which constitutes subjects and objects. But within 
Foucault’s methodology this emptiness is merely the emp-
tiness of analytical categories in abstraction from their em-
pirical application on concrete ways of thinking and acting.

Veyne thus transforms method into metaphysics. There 
is an entity called “practice” that constitutes subjects and 
objects. All of us are the products and prisoners of such 
practices. One can escape one’s practice only by entering 
a new one. The general structure of the original problem-
atic is reproduced: the subject of transcendental philoso-
phy is replaced with discursive practices constituting sub-
jects. We could say, paraphrasing Husserl, that what we 
get with Veyne is a description of the functioning of discur-
sive practices in the constitution of the world. 
We see in Veyne’s reading a transcendent use of meth-
odological principles wherein they are disengaged from 
empirical use and mistaken for principles providing a priori 
knowledge of the nature of the thing under scrutiny. What 
we are dealing with is a “natural and unavoidable illusion,” 
as Kant wrote, which rests on principles of methodology 
and passes them off as knowledge of the thing studied. In 
this case, knowledge of the very nature of knowledge it-
self: the process of its historical constitution.

Leerlaufende Räder und TLP 6.53 
Raphael Borchers  
Leipzig, Germany | raphaelborchers@posteo.de  
Abstract 
Wittgenstein’s preferred technical metaphors are not infrequently subject to functional changes. By abandoning the concept of 
the independence of elementary propositions, for example, Wittgenstein points out that a sentence system rather than a single 
sentence is the scale to be applied to reality. The thought expressed in his metaphor of idle wheels finds itself reflected 
throughout his entire oeuvre and therefore serves well to retrace Wittgenstein’s philosophical development. While the early 
Wittgenstein still follows Heinrich Hertz’s idea to eliminate idle wheels, the middle Wittgenstein recognizes their inevitability and 
the later Wittgenstein even acknowledges that they make some kind of ‘sense’ for our language. I shall show that even though 
the metaphor of idle wheels does not explicitly appear in the Tractatus, it can be used to decipher the enigmatic sentence TLP 
6.53 and its meaning for the tractarian project, leading to a clearer understanding of why this project was eventually abandoned. 
 
 
1. Leerlaufende und gekuppelte Räder in 
den Wiener Gesprächen 
Die Metapher der leerlaufenden Räder
1 findet bei Wittgen-
stein ihren mutmaßlich erstmaligen, expliziten Gebrauch in 
einem Eintrag vom 25. Nov. 1929 im Manuskript 107, den 
er später an prominenter Stelle in das Typoskript 209 
(=PB) übernommen hat. Der Eintrag ist Teil seiner Erläute-
rung des Unterschieds einer primären ‚phänomenologi-
schen‘ und einer sekundären ‚physikalischen‘ Sprache: 
„Eine Erkenntnis dessen, was unserer Sprache wesent-
lich und was ihr zur Darstellung unwesentlich ist, eine 
Erkenntnis, welche Teile unserer Sprache leerlaufende 
Räder sind, kommt auf die Konstruktion einer phäno-
menologischen Sprache hinaus.“ (PB: 51; WA2: 119) 
Geradeso wie ein leerlaufendes Rad in einer Maschine für 
ihren Mechanismus bloß „überflüssiges Beiwerk“ (WA2: 
133) sei, so sei ein leerlaufendes Rad ein Teil der Spra-
che, der für ihren Mechanismus, der Darstellung der Wirk-
lichkeit, unwesentlich sei. Was der Sprache wesentlich sei, 
versteht Wittgenstein – der Metaphorik folgend – mithin als 
ein ‚gekuppeltes Rad‘ (PU § 507), ein Rad, ohne das der 
Mechanismus der Wirklichkeitsdarstellung nicht „[a]rbeiten“ 
(PU § 109) könne. Die phänomenologische Sprache sei 
nun die Sprache, in der jene Teile, die gleichsam als leer-
laufende Räder in einem Mechanismus beschrieben wer-
den können, als solche erkannt sind. 
Die Unbefangenheit mit der Wittgenstein in dieser zu-
nächst privaten Notiz auf diese technische Metaphorik für 
die Funktionsweise der Sprache zurückgreift, macht deut-
lich, dass sie ihm zur Zeit des Eintrags nicht ein neuer Ein-
fall, sondern ein vertrautes Bild ist. Es fehlt daher auch 
seine typische Einleitung neuer Vergleiche der Art: ‚es 
verhält sich gleichsam wie…‘. Anders liegt es bei der ers-
ten semi-öffentlichen Verwendung der Metapher während 
eines Treffens mit Waismann und Schlick am 22. Dez. 
1929 in Wien. Hier wird deutlich, dass sich Wittgenstein 
der Neuheit der Metapher für sein Publikum bewusst ist: 
„Nun ist das merkwürdig, daß es in unserer Sprache 
etwas gibt, das ich einem leerlaufenden Rad in einer 
Maschine vergleichen möchte. Ich werde gleich erklä-
ren was ich damit meine.“ (WWK: 47) 
                                                      
1 Es kann hier freilich nur auf ausgewählte Passagen Bezug ge-
nommen und daher weder die gesamte Varianz der Metapher noch 
die aus ihr zu entnehmende Entwicklung des Gedankens, der sich 
in ihr ausdrückt, ausführlich vorgestellt werden. 
Die angekündigte Erklärung fällt wie folgt aus: Ein leerlau-
fendes Rad in der Sprache sei etwas, das nicht verifiziert 
werden könne. Auf das tractarianische Sinnkriterium über-
tragen versteht Wittgenstein unter einem leerlaufenden 
Rad demnach etwas, das keinen Sinn habe (WWK: 65), 
einen sinnlosen oder unsinnigen Satz; unter einem gekup-
pelten Rad mithin einen sinnvollen Satz. Keinen Sinn etwa 
habe die Rede vom Zahnschmerz: Er greife nicht in die 
Wirklichkeit ein, bleibe ungekuppelt, da es unmöglich sei, 
die Perspektive der ersten Person zu teilen. Hat jemand 
Zahnschmerz, so sei ihm dieser exklusiv vorbehalten. Eine 
Verifikation, die eine Perspektive der dritten Person ver-
lange, sei im Falle eines Zahnschmerzes unmöglich. Des-
wegen, so Wittgenstein in nämlicher Unterredung, gehöre 
das Wort ‚Ich‘ als ein leerlaufendes Rad im Sprachmecha-
nismus „zu denjenigen Wörtern, die man aus der Sprache 
eliminieren kann.“ (WWK: 49). Hierzu passt ein Eintrag in 
MS 107 vom 13. Dez. 1929 (also nur wenige Tage zuvor), 
in dem Wittgenstein die Wichtigkeit des ‚Ausschaltens‘ 
leerlaufender Räder in unserer Sprache, aber auch ihre 
Grenzen betont: „[…] es lassen sich aus unserer Sprache 
leer laufende Räder entfernen; aber nicht allzu viele.“ 
(WA2: 133) 
Es ist bezeichnend, dass Wittgenstein im TS 209 genau 
diese Passage trotz der hinzugefügten Einschränkung 
nicht übernommen hat. (Sowohl der Absatz zuvor als auch 
danach sind übernommen.) Denn nur wenig später sieht er 
offenbar ein, dass es durchaus Teile der Sprache gibt, die 
zwar leerlaufende Räder zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt 
sind, zu einem anderen aber durchaus gekuppelt auftreten 
können: 
„Die Hypothese hat gleichsam ein leerlaufendes Rad: 
Solange keine weiteren Erfahrungen auftreten, bleibt 
das Rad unbenützt, und es tritt erst dann in Aktion, so-
bald es gilt, weitere Erfahrungen miteinzubeziehen.“ 
(WWK: 160) 
Will man an der Sinnhaftigkeit von Hypothesen festhalten, 
so erscheint das Sinnkriterium des Tractatus, das Eingrei-
fen des Satzes in die Wirklichkeit, zu eng. Hierin liegt der 
Grund dafür, dass Wittgenstein 1929 eine phänomenologi-
sche Sprache von einer physikalischen unterscheidet. 
Während die erste nur Möglichkeiten konstatiert, stellt die 
zweite Hypothesen auf, die in der ersten als leerlaufende 
Räder auftreten (PB: 51). Um den Gedanken weiter zu 
führen, müsste man einen primären und einen sekundären 
Sinn annehmen. Dergleichen kam für Wittgenstein freilich 
nicht in Frage und folglich gibt er auch schon bald die Un-

terscheidung ‚phänomenologisch – physikalisch‘ wieder 
auf. Sie ist ein Produkt des Ringens um eine Korrektur 
seines tractarianischen Projekts. Wittgenstein schwankt 
hier zwischen der Forderung nach der Eliminierung und 
der Einsicht in die Unausweichlichkeit mancher leerlaufen-
der Räder für unsere Sprachpraxis. 
Hiermit ist m. E. ein ganz wesentlicher Entwicklungs-
schritt in Wittgensteins philosophischen Überlegungen 
markiert. Während der frühe Wittgenstein der Überzeu-
gung ist, seinen aufgewühlten Geist durch die Eliminierung 
leerlaufender Räder aus unserer Sprachpraxis beruhigen 
zu können, lässt sich anhand der Wiener Gespräche seine 
allmähliche Einsicht nachvollziehen, dass manches leer-
laufende Rad für unsere Sprachpraxis unvermeidlich ist 
und daher allein ihre Identifizierung als die Aufgabe der 
Philosophie übrig bleibt. Deswegen spricht er vom ‚Erken-
nen‘ (WWK: 48) leerlaufender Räder in unserem Sprach-
gebrauch, der – um seiner damaligen Terminologie zu fol-
gen – weniger ‚phänomenologisch‘ als vielmehr ‚physika-
lisch‘ ist. Was Wittgenstein seiner Selbstbekundung nach 
von nun an lehren will, ist nicht eine von überflüssigem 
Beiwerk befreite Sprache, sondern „von einem nicht offen-
kundigen Unsinn zu einem offenkundigen überzugehen.“ 
(PU § 464) 
 
2. Hertz’ Bedingungen wissenschaftlicher 
Modellierung (TLP 4.04) 
Die bei Wittgenstein besonders um 1930 präsente Meta-
pher der leerlaufenden Räder ist keine genuin witt-
gensteinsche Erfindung. Bereits Heinrich Hertz verwendet 
sie in seiner Voraberläuterung der Bedingungen einer er-
folgreichen Modellierung der Wirklichkeit in der Einleitung 
zu den Prinzipien der Mechanik. Der Einfluss Hertz’ auf 
den jungen Wittgenstein ist vielfach beleuchtet und nach-
gewiesen worden (Hamilton 2002). Es liegt daher die Ver-
mutung nicht fern, dass der mittlere Wittgenstein die hertz-
sche Metapher seit langem kennt. Im Zusammenhang sei-
ner neuen Überlegung greift er sie lediglich zum ersten 
Mal für seine eigenen Überlegungen auf, obwohl ihm der 
mit ihr ausgedrückte Gedanke längst vertraut ist und auch 
maßgeblich im Tractatus seinen Niederschlag gefunden 
hat. 
Deutlich wird das etwa anhand der Übernahme der 
hertzschen Terminologie in den Erläuterungen des „Prin-
zip[s] der Vertretung von Gegenständen durch Zeichen“ 
(TLP 4.0312). Wie Wittgenstein spricht auch Hertz (1894: 
2) von „Bilder[n]“, die „unsere Vorstellungen von den Din-
gen“ seien. Es ist nach Hertz das wichtigste Prinzip erfolg-
reicher wissenschaftlicher Modellierung. Es ist so trivial 
wie wichtig zu verstehen, dass das hertzsche und 
wittgensteinsche Bild somit immer als ein abbildendes Bild 
zu verstehen ist. Abbildende Bilder bilden etwas ab; im 
Gegensatz zu fiktiven Bildern, die nichts abbilden. Ein 
nicht-abbildendes Bild ist nach Wittgenstein nicht ein fal-
sches Bild, sondern überhaupt keine Abbildung (TLP 
2.22). Das Bild als solches ist „unabhängig von seiner 
Wahr- oder Falschheit“ (TLP 2.22). Ob es sich um eine 
bildliche Modellierung der Wirklichkeit handelt, sei allein 
abhängig von der logischen Form, die der Form der Wirk-
lichkeit entsprechen müsse (TLP 2.18). Um diese Bedin-
gung zu erfüllen, muss es trivialerweise etwas, nämlich die 
Tatsache (TLP 3), geben, die abgebildet wird; gibt es sie 
nicht, – so könnte man sagen – wird eine Abbildung bloß 
vorgetäuscht und es entstehen erhebliche Verwirrungen. 
Hertz’ Musterbeispiel für eine vorgetäuschte Abbildung ist 
der angeblich metaphysische Begriff der Kraft, den er mit 
einem leergehenden Nebenrad vergleicht: 
„Es kann nicht geleugnet werden, daſs in sehr vielen 
Fällen die Kräfte, welche unsere Mechanik zur Behand-
lung physikalischer Probleme eingeführt hat, nur als 
leergehende Nebenräder mitlaufen, um überall da auſ-
ser Wirksamkeit zu treten, wo es gilt, wirkliche Thatsa-
chen darzustellen.“ (Hertz 1894: 14) 
Es ist Hertz’ und dann auch Wittgesteins quietistisches 
Anliegen, solche, den Geist quälenden Verwirrungen (PU 
§ 132) in der Modellierung der Wirklichkeit strikt zu ver-
meiden, indem von vornherein „die unklare[] Frage“ nach 
dem Sinn eines leergehenden Nebenrades als „unberech-
tigte Frage“ erkannt wird (Hertz 1894: 9). Für eine erfolg-
reiche Modellierung der Wirklichkeit seien sie zu eliminie-
ren. Jedes Rad im Modell müsse gekuppelt sein. Nur auf 
diese Weise ist nach Hertz und Wittgenstein der durch die 
sprachliche Verwirrung aufgewühlte Geist wieder zu beru-
higen. 
Es lässt sich leicht zeigen, dass diese metaphorische Er-
läuterung Hertz’ ihre Wirkung auf den jungen Wittgenstein 
nicht verfehlt hat. Hertz wird von Wittgenstein im Tractatus 
zweimal explizit erwähnt. Die erste Erwähnung in TLP 
4.04, wo Wittgenstein seinen Begriff der logischen Mannig-
faltigkeit einführt, ist hier von Interesse. Er verweist dort 
auf §§ 418 bis 428 der Prinzipien der Mechanik, in denen 
Hertz seine drei Bedingungen dynamischer Modelle aus-
führt (Hertz 1894: 197). Für die hiesige Betrachtung ist 
besonders die erste relevant. Auf Wittgensteins Satzkon-
zeption übertragen, verlangt sie, dass der Satz (bzw. das 
Bild/Modell) ebenso viele Elemente (bzw. Zeichen) aufwei-
sen müsse, wie Elemente (bzw. Gegenstände) in der 
Sachlage enthalten sind, die er darstellt. Es sind zwei Fälle 
denkbar, in denen diese Bedingung nicht erfüllt wäre: Zum 
einen dann, wenn der Satz weniger Elemente enthielte als 
die Sachlage. Für diesen Fall wäre dem Satz schlicht sei-
ne Modellhaftigkeit abzusprechen; er würde eine andere 
Sachlage darstellen bzw. eine andere Tatsache abbilden. 
Zum anderen dann, wenn der Satz mehr Elemente enthiel-
te als die Sachlage. Dies entspräche eben jenem Fall, vor 
dem Hertz in seiner Einleitung als eine wesentliche Gefahr 
der wissenschaftlichen Modellierung warnt. Es würde ein 
Element in das Modell eingefügt, das keine Ergründung 
zulassen würde, weil ihm in der Wirklichkeit nichts ent-
spräche. Die Frage nach seinem Sinn für das Modell liefe 
ins Leere, sie wäre eine „unberechtigte Frage“. 
Der Verstoß gegen diese erste Bedingung der Definition 
dynamischer Modelle entspricht also exakt jenem Fall ei-
nes leergehenden Nebenrades in einem Modell der Wirk-
lichkeit, wie es Hertz in der Einleitung beschreibt. Mit TLP 
4.04 rekurriert Wittgenstein hiernach zwar indirekt, aber 
dennoch eindeutig auf die hertzsche Forderung der Elimi-
nierung leergehender Nebenräder für die Modellierung der 
Wirklichkeit: „Am Satz muß gerade soviel zu unterscheiden 
sein, als an der Sachlage, die er darstellt.“ (TLP 4.04) Bis 
hierher ist allerdings noch nichts zur Bedeutung dieser 
Forderung für das tractarianische Projekt gesagt. 
3. Philosophie als Tätigkeit, die mit Philo-
sophie nichts zu tun hat (TLP 6.53) 
Im Tractatus ist es letztlich auch Satz 7, in dem die Forde-
rung der Eliminierung leerlaufender Räder ausgesprochen 
ist. Noch deutlicher aber wird sie in dem rätselhaften, aber 
vielleicht gerade deswegen so aufschlussreichen Satz TLP 
6.53:

„Die richtige Methode der Philosophie wäre eigentlich 
die: Nichts zu sagen, als was sich sagen lässt, also 
Sätze der Naturwissenschaft – also etwas, was mit Phi-
losophie nichts zu tun hat […].“ 
Entgegen PU § 133 stellt der frühe Wittgenstein hier die 
irritierende Behauptung auf, es gebe eine „streng richtige“ 
(TLP 6.53) Methode der Philosophie, die darin bestehe, 
etwas zu tun, was nichts mit Philosophie zu tun habe. Wie 
ist das zu verstehen? Ist hiermit der carnapsche Kniefall 
der Philosophie vor der Naturwissenschaft ausgespro-
chen? 
Zunächst sei auf Folgendes hingewiesen: Wenn die rich-
tige Methode der Philosophie, die Vermeidung leerlaufen-
der Räder in unserem Sprachgebrauch, eine Tätigkeit ist, 
die nichts mit Philosophie zu tun hat, dann ist damit auch 
gesagt, dass Philosophie etwas mit leerlaufenden Rädern 
zu tun hat. In diesem Sinne ist schließlich auch PU § 119 
verfasst: „Die Ergebnisse der Philosophie sind die Entde-
ckung irgendeines schlichten Unsinns […].“ Unsinn solle 
aber im Sprachgebrauch gerade gemieden werden, weil er 
unaussprechlich sei, etwa Wertaussagen der ersten Per-
son (WWK: 117), das Ethische und Mystische (TLP 6.522). 
Wenn Wittgenstein behauptet, der Tractatus sei „streng 
philosophisch“ (BW: 95), dann kann das demzufolge ent-
weder heißen, er verfährt dort nach der eigentlich richtigen 
Methode der Philosophie und vermeidet mithin leerlaufen-
de Räder; oder es heißt, dass er sich mit leerlaufenden 
Rädern als den eigentlichen Gegenständen der Philoso-
phie beschäftigt. Die Antwort auf diese Frage fällt nicht 
einfach: Einerseits weist Satz TLP 6.54 darauf hin, dass 
der Tractatus tatsächlich aus leerlaufenden Rädern be-
steht, dort die eigentliche philosophische Methode also 
gerade missachtet wird; – was in TLP 6.53 den Konjunktiv 
(„wäre eigentlich“) erklärt. Andererseits erscheint der Trac-
tatus zwar rätselhaft, aber dennoch nicht als eine primär 
mystische Abhandlung. Auch die Ethik ist eher ein Rand-
thema und nur auf einer Metaebene im Anschluss an die 
scheinbar wichtigeren Überlegungen bis TLP 6 behandelt. 
Zur Klärung empfiehlt es sich, an zwei selbstreflektie-
rende Äußerungen Wittgensteins zu erinnern: Dem Verle-
ger Ludwig v. Ficker gibt Wittgenstein 1919 den bekannten 
Hinweis, dass nur ein Teil des Tractatus niedergeschrie-
ben sei, und zwar der unwichtigere. Der wichtigere Teil, 
der das Ethische behandle, sei gerade dadurch „festge-
legt“ (BW: 96-97), dass über ihn geschwiegen werde. In 
den Vermischten Bemerkungen findet sich eine Bemer-
kung von 1931, die diesen Gedanken wieder aufgreift: 
„Das Unaussprechbare (das, was mir geheimnisvoll er-
scheint und ich nicht auszusprechen vermag) gibt viel-
leicht den Hintergrund, auf dem das, was ich ausspre-
chen konnte, Bedeutung bekommt“ (VB: 472). 
Katrin Eggers (2011: 232) hat diese Bemerkungen un-
längst unter dem Aspekt beleuchtet, inwiefern eine Be-
trachtung des literarischen Vordergrundes wittgenstein-
scher Texte, ähnlich der „Wechselwirkung von operativer 
Struktur und thematischer Fläche“ in der Musik, den un-
aussprechlichen Hintergrund hervortreten lasse. Doch es 
ist meiner Meinung nach noch mehr als diese performative 
Vexierbildtechnik (PU: 541) auf textueller Ebene, auf die in 
diesen Bemerkungen hingewiesen wird. Angesprochen ist 
hiermit auch der wichtige Gedanke des Tractatus, den Un-
sinn gerade dadurch hervortreten zu lassen (TLP 4.115), 
dass „in der Sprache“ (TLP Vorwort) und mit ihr die Gren-
ze des sinnvoll Sagbaren gezogen wird. Mit anderen Wor-
ten: der Tractatus versucht zu zeigen, warum die Vermei-
dung leerlaufender Räder in unserem Sprachgebrauch, 
wie in einem Vexierbild eben die vermiedenen leerlaufen-
den Räder hervortreten lässt. Nur so ist die Philosophie, 
als eine Tätigkeit zu verstehen, die mit Philosophie, mit 
ihrem eigentlichen Gegenstand, vordergründig nichts zu 
tun hat. Dadurch aber, dass sie sich allein auf den Vorder-
grund beschränkt und so eine scharfe Grenze zum Hinter-
grund markiert, soll sich dieser zeigen, auch ohne, dass er 
ausgesprochen wird. Es ist zwar etwas zugespitzt formu-
liert, aber meines Erachtens dennoch richtig zu konstatie-
ren, dass der Tractatus daher nur vordergründig eine logi-
sche Abhandlung, in seiner eigentlichen Intention vielmehr 
„ein im religiösen Geist geschriebenes Buch“ ist (Tetens 
2009: 6). Logisch ist der Tractatus insofern, als mittels der 
sinnlosen logischen Sätze das Sinnvolle, der Raum des 
Möglichen, zwischen Kontradiktion und Tautologie be-
grenzt wird. Da sinnlose Sätze gleichfalls wie Unsinn in der 
Sprache als leerlaufende Räder erscheinen, besteht der 
Tractatus selbst zu einem erheblichen Teil aus leerlaufen-
den Rädern (TLP 6.54). Die Logik als die Grenze zwischen 
Sinn und Unsinn dient der Vexiertechnik, den Unsinn aus 
dem Sinn hervortreten zu lassen. 
4. Schluss 
Mit PU § 119 wird deutlich, dass sich dieser philosophi-
sche Ansatz in gewisser Weise bis in die Philosophischen 
Untersuchungen erhalten hat: 
„Beulen, die sich der Verstand beim Anrennen an die 
Grenzen der Sprache geholt hat […], lassen uns den 
Wert jener [scil. unsinnigen] Entdeckungen erkennen.“ 
Gleichwohl wird anhand der Betrachtung der Metapher der 
leerlaufenden Räder klar, dass sich Wittgenstein zur Zeit 
der Wiener Gespräche der Problematik der Gelingensbe-
dingungen dieses Ansatzes bewusst wird. Um 1930 stellt 
sich bei ihm die Einsicht ein, dass die Eliminierung leerlau-
fender Räder aufgrund ihrer teilweisen Unausweichlichkeit 
ein unmögliches Unterfangen darstellt, dass überhaupt 
das Sinnkriterium als eine Kupplung mit der Wirklichkeit zu 
eng gefasst ist. Das Eingreifen eines Satzes in den „Begriff 
der Wahrheit“ verwirft er folgerichtig als ein „schlechtes 
Bild.“ (PU § 136) Es sei vielmehr so, notiert Wittgenstein 
am 21. Febr. 1931, dass die Worte „gleichsam in uns ein-
griffen.“ (PU § 507; Hervorhebung RB) Der sinnvolle Satz 
greift in unsere bestehende Sprachpraxis ein und wird so 
Teil eines höchst dynamischen Prozesses, der keine kla-
ren Grenzen erlaubt. Das heißt, ein leerlaufendes Rad 
muss nicht für immer aus dem Sprachmechanismus ex-
kludiert bleiben und ein gekuppeltes Rad könnte irgend-
wann durchaus leer laufen. 
Mutatis mutandis ist es möglich, einen äußerst wichtigen 
Grund für Wittgensteins Abkehr vom tractarianischen Pro-
jekt zu benennen: Sofern die Möglichkeit einer klaren 
Grenzziehung ausgeschlossen ist, kann nur noch schwer-
lich eine Vexiertechnik zum Einsatz kommen. Die Idee des 
Tractatus, das Unsagbare mittels der strengen wissen-
schaftlichen Methode der Wirklichkeitsmodellierung wie in 
einem Vexierbild hervortreten zu lassen, musste von Witt-
genstein im Hinblick auf die ‚Verwobenheit‘ (PU § 7) leer-
laufender Räder in unserer Sprachpraxis folgerichtig auf-
gegeben werden.

Philosophical and Rational Intuition 
Ana Butković 
Zagreb, Croatia | abutkovic@hrstud.hr 
Abstract 
According to the received view, intuitions are, in epistemological and methodological sense, important as a source of a priori 
evidence in contemporary analytic philosophy. There is, however, an apparent ambiguity in the usage of the term ‘rational intui-
tion’, which by some rationalists covers a so-called philosophical or classification intuition as well. This ambiguity makes difficult 
to understand what is actually asserted about intuitions and what is disputed. Rationalists frequently explain rational intuition by 
means of necessity and abstractness concepts, without clearly indicating why they do so. In this paper I will try to show that ra-
tionalists’ accounts are deficient because they fail to justify and explain the use of these concepts, together with the concepts of 
other properties standardly attributed to intuitions. Consequently, they exclude philosophical intuition from their accounts, con-
trary to their claim that this type of intuition is of special interest to philosophy as a source of philosophical knowledge. 
 
 
The prevailing opinion among philosophers nowadays is 
that intuitions are, in epistemological and methodological 
sense, a source of a priori evidence, especially important 
in contemporary analytic philosophy. Goldman, for exam-
ple, writes that “one thing that distinguishes philosophical 
methodology from the methodology of the sciences is its 
extensive and avowed reliance on intuition” (2007: 1). 
These intuitions are defined as spontaneous, non-
inferential judgments on how certain property is exempli-
fied in hypothetical cases. Thus, they serve as the source 
of a priori evidence for a philosophical hypothesis about 
the nature of that property. For instance, the intuition that 
in Gettier’s cases Smith does not know helped us to clarify 
the concept of knowledge. That intuition was prima facie 
evidence against the traditional definition of knowledge as 
justified true belief. I will call this type of intuition philoso-
phical or classification intuitions, because they are about 
how various categories or concepts are to be applied in 
certain cases.1 The problem is that contemporary rational-
ists, when defining rational intuition by means of necessity 
and abstractness, exclude philosophical viz. classification 
intuitions from their accounts, while maintaining that they 
are of especial importance for philosophy as a source of a 
priori justification. This would be a lesser problem had they 
not, primarily George Bealer, Laurence BonJour and 
Ernest Sosa, considered them as a subclass of rational 
intuition. In what follows I will shortly present some of the 
most prominent rationalists’ accounts and then try to show 
that rational intuition defined in terms of necessity and ab-
stractness eliminates a certain kind of intuition from their 
accounts, namely philosophical (hereafter classification) 
intuition. 
For BonJour, rational insight is “[the] direct insight into 
the necessity of the claim in question that seems, at least 
prima facie, to justify my accepting it as true.” (1998: 101). 
Moreover, he asserts that “it does not seem in general to 
depend on any particular sort of criterion or on any further 
discursive or ratiocinative process, but is instead direct and 
immediate” (1998: 106). 
When Bealer discusses intuition, he does not mean “any 
magical power or inner voice or special glow or any other 
mysterious quality” (1998: 207). Intuition is a genuine kind 
of conscious episode, a sui generis, natural propositional 
attitude. He distinguishes the a priori from a non-a priori 
type of intuition in the following way:  
                                                      
1 Golman (2007), Jackson (1998) and Bealer (1996) think that classification 
intuition is the central type of philosophical intuition. 
When we speak of intuition here, we mean “a priori in-
tuition”. This is distinguished from what physicists call 
“physical intuition”. We have a physical intuition that, 
when a house is undermined, it will fall. This does not 
count as an a priori intuition, for it does not present it-
self as necessary […] By contrast, when we have an a 
priori intuition, say, that if P then not not P, this presents 
itself as necessary […]. (1996: 5) 
Sosa’s view is that: 
S rationally intuits that p if and only if S’s intuitive attrac-
tion to assent to <p>is explained by a competence (an 
epistemic ability or virtue) on the part of S to discrimi-
nate, among contents that he understands well enough, 
the true from the false, in some subfield of the modally 
strong (the necessarily true or necessarily false) […]. 
(2007b: 61)  
The focus in these rationalists’ theories is on necessity. 
However, the relation between intuition and necessity is 
never fully explained. This is very problematic since ne-
cessity is an underlying feature of the rational intuition as 
opposed to other types of intuitions. For instance, Bealer 
writes “I am unsure how to analyze what is meant by say-
ing that an a priori intuition presents itself as necessary. 
Perhaps something like this: necessarily, if x intuits that P, 
it seems to x that P and also that necessarily P. But I wish 
to take no stand on this“ (1996b: 5). Sosa is as unclear as 
Bealer is, for he says that there is no particular reason for 
doing so, except “that [modal propositions] seems the 
proper domain for philosophical uses of intuition” (2007a: 
101).The problem is that the main feature of rational intui-
tion, the necessity of the intuited content, is left unex-
plained. In other words, why should we think that necessity 
is a necessary element of all intuitions? 
Carrie Jenkins (forthcoming), e.g., distinguishes four 
“bundles of symptoms”, standardly associated with intui-
tions: (i) intuitions are commonsensical (i.e. folk opinions), 
and not contaminated with theories; (ii) they are a priori, 
the intuited subject matter is necessary, they are gener-
ated by conceptual analysis and/or competence, and are 
the upshot of the special faculty; (iii) they are direct in the 
sense of non-inferential provenance (immediacy1) or obvi-
ous and/or spontaneous and/or compelling (immediacy2); 
(iv) intuitions are starting points for philosophical enquiries, 
reliance on intuitions is taken to be the characteristic of 
analytic philosophy, and they provide evidence in philoso-
phy.

Jenkins claims that all these bundles of symptoms do not 
go together. So, according to Jenkins, it is easy to see that 
a prioricity and commonsensicality differ significantly in 
extension. For example, theorems of advanced mathemat-
ics are a priori, but not commonsensical, and propositions 
like Grass is green are commonsensical but not a priori. 
Jenkins concludes that the term ‘intuition’ has (at least) two 
different extensions and that one is not necessarily better 
than the other:  
[…] it seems to me that some philosophers use ‘intui-
tion’ in a bundle-one driven sense, whereby com-
monsensicality and/or related features are important for 
whether or not it counts as an “intuition”, but features 
related to a prioricity are irrelevant. And I think that 
some philosophers use ‘intuition’ in a bundle-two driven 
sense, whereby a prioricity and/or related features are 
important but features related to commonsensicality are 
irrelevant. (Jenkins, forthcoming) 
I would add that a prioricity and symptoms in bundle (iv) 
also do not go together (e.g. intuition that the internalism is 
correct as a starting point in philosophical enquiry does not 
seem to be a priori in the same way mathematical intui-
tions are). 
Goldman (2007) distinguishes between intuitions, how-
ever, not by means of certain class of properties, but by 
means of types of processes that produce intuitions. He 
states that: 
There is no reason to expect logical intuitions to be 
products of the same faculty. [Classification] intuitions 
are likely to have still different psychological sources 
[…]. So if the suggestion is that application intuitions 
should be grouped with mathematical and logical intui-
tions because of a uniform causal process or faculty of 
intellectual insight, this is psychologically untenable. 
[…] Moreover, difference of psychological origin is im-
portant, because it undercuts the notion that rational in-
tuitions are homogeneous in their reliability. Arithmetic 
intuitions might be reliable – even modally reliable – 
without [classification] intuitions being comparably reli-
able. (2007: 11).  
Casullo (2012) also thinks that it is an open question of 
whether the same cognitive process produces all types of 
intuitions. It is possible that classification and modal intui-
tions are produced by different processes, and this can be 
verified only after the relevant empirical investigations are 
conducted.  
I agree with Jenkins that, due to aforementioned diver-
sity, the distinction between at least two types of intuition 
needs to be made, namely classification and rational intui-
tion. In what follows I will try to show that classification in-
tuitions are not related to the propositional contents which 
are necessary, their contents are not about abstract ob-
jects, and they are not equally reliable as mathematical 
and logical intuitions. So, by adducing aprioricity, necessity 
and abstractness as the central features of the rational 
intuition, rationalists eliminate classification intuitions from 
their accounts.    
Let me start with necessity. Firstly, as already noted ra-
tionalists do not indicate why they insist on necessity. Sec-
ondly, in Gettier cases it is possible to have a classification 
intuition without an accompanying modal intuition (Gold-
man, 2007: 10). In other words, classification and modal 
intuitions come apart, and it is questionable whether the 
latter ever occurs, and, if it occurs, whether it occurs spon-
taneously. 
It 
is 
also 
questionable 
whether 
non-
philosophers (and some philosophers, too) have the intui-
tion that, in Gettier’s cases, it is necessary that Smith does 
not know in addition to the intuition that Smith does not 
know. Thirdly, according to rationalists’ accounts, to ra-
tionally intuit that p, it seems to x  
(N1) that it is necessarily p 
Williamson (2012) claims that this raises a serious issue 
since a precondition of knowing a necessary truth is know-
ing that it is necessary and this generates an infinite re-
gress. Namely since (N1) is itself necessary, a precondi-
tion of knowing (N1) would be knowing  
(NN1) It is necessary that it is necessary that p 
and so on ad infinitum. He concludes that an infinite re-
gress can be avoided by eliminating the necessary condi-
tion from account of rational intuition, namely that knowl-
edge of necessary truths does not imply knowledge that 
they are necessary. 
Furthermore classification intuitions are, as opposed to 
rational ones, susceptible to the influence of the back-
ground knowledge, and they can change over time, which 
is the second distinctive feature. For instance, intuition that 
proposition that Nothing can be red and green all over at 
the same time is true independently of our background 
knowledge or philosophical theory we defend. On the other 
hand, the intuition that in Keith Lehrer’s (1990) case Mr. 
Trutemp does not know can change over time in light of 
new information and arguments that could convince us in 
the unsustainability of internalist position. It seems obvious 
that intuitions about these two cases cannot be of the 
same kind, that is, they cannot be produced by the same 
process and, consequently, cannot be attributed the same 
degree of a priority and reliability, or be accounted for in 
the same way.  
The third distinctive feature of classification intuitions 
consists in the particularity of the propositional contents, 
contrary to the generality of the propositional contents of 
rational intuitions. For instance, Sosa argues “[t]o intuit is 
to believe an abstract proposition merely because one un-
derstands it and it is of a certain sort” (1998: 263-4). The 
question Goldman raises is how this view could accommo-
date the fact that classification intuitions are often con-
cerned with particulars, both particular individuals and par-
ticular situations. He concludes that Sosa’s account 
threatens to rule out the very instances of intuitions in 
which we are mostly interested.  
Furthermore, the epistemic role of classification intuitions 
is the primary target of experimental philosophy. The way 
the proponents of experimental philosophy interpret the 
surveys’ results suggests that classification intuitions differ 
among people, and that they are under the influence of 
epistemically irrelevant factors, such as cultural diversity, 
gender, educational level, etc. Although the surveys that 
might clarify whether rational intuition would differ among 
people were not conducted, I think it is unlikely, if not im-
possible, that one culture could share the intuition that the 
proposition that Nothing can be red and green all over at 
the same time is (necessarily) true, whereas others cul-
tures would have the intuition that it is (necessarily) false. 
Consequently, classification intuitions would be less reli-
able than rational ones. And since justification comes in 
degrees, it could be argued that rational intuition has a 
higher degree of a priori justification than classification in-
tuition. In that case, rationalists would have to be able to 
explain how the same cognitive ability or cognitive process 
concurrently produces intuitions whose content is neces-
sary, and those whose content is not necessary. Likewise, 
they would have to explain how the same cognitive ability

is causally responsible for those intuitions that are affected 
by background knowledge and for those that are not. With 
respect to this, it is very likely that there is no single psy-
chological cognitive ability or process of rational intuition, 
which produces all the intuitions, as rationalists argue. The 
psychological process or processes that are responsible 
for creating mathematical intuitions are probably different 
from those responsible for creating classification intuitions 
(Goldman, 2007: 11).  
So, in order to have a unified account of intuitions ra-
tionalists are left with two options: either they must dis-
avow the aforementioned concepts of necessity and ab-
stractness as underlying features of rational intuition as a 
source of a priori justification and knowledge, or disavow a 
certain type of intuition, namely classification intuitions as 
an a priori and rational ones.  
My conclusion is that we should not persist in the unified 
account of intuitions because it is likely that different psy-
chological processes are responsible for producing them. 
Consequently, some of them are more “rational” and more 
“a priori” than the others. If this is right, then rationalists 
should make an explicit distinction between intuitions ac-
cording to the varieties of properties standardly attributed 
to them because (i) by defining rational intuition by means 
of necessity and abstractness they are doing it anyway 
implicitly, and (ii) by distinguishing between classification 
and rational intuition the latter is more immune to the at-
tacks by experimental philosophers, which are mainly 
aimed at discrediting intuitions as a source of a priori justi-
fication.

Who are “we”? The problem about Wittgenstein’s idealism 
Eduardo Caliendo Marchesan 
Paris, France | ecmarchesan@hotmail.com  
Abstract 
Questioning the bases of the discussion about Wittgenstein’s alleged idealism, this paper intends to show that it is founded 
upon a misreading of the way in which the Investigations employs the pronoun “we”: an apparent ambiguity shown in two possi-
ble meanings of the word “we” that would oppose an empirical and a transcendental view. However, my main objective is not 
only to expose the falsity of this problem but also to look for a more fundamental question that motivates it. Through the identifi-
cation of the idealist hypothesis’ roots we end up finding an important problem inside Wittgenstein’ work. 
 
 
Introduction 
Was Wittgenstein an idealist? Which elements of a certain 
kind of idealism can we find in his second philosophy? If 
we rush to answer these questions, or even to deny their 
validity, we may forget to ask something more fundamen-
tal: what motivates them? Which assumptions allow their 
formulation? In other words, what is the point of asking 
them? This paper is concerned not with an answer to the 
problem about Wittgenstein’s idealism, but with the foun-
dations of its statement. Through the reading of Williams’ 
text “Wittgenstein and Idealism” and its commentary by 
Lear, I intend to show how the argument erected to dem-
onstrate the presence of idealist elements in Wittgenstein’s 
post-Tractatus work is built over a false problem: the am-
biguity in the employment of the pronoun “we”. An ambigu-
ity shown in two possible meanings of the word “we”: a) in 
one of them, the pronoun would have a limited extension, 
denoting a particular group among others, establishing an 
opposition between “us” and “them”; b) in the other one, it 
would refer to humanity as a generality to which there 
could be no possible opposition. The latter implies a kind 
of universal rationality and the denial of the existence of 
other minds much like Frege used to propose, while the 
former is described as relativism and supposes the exis-
tence of radically disjointed worldviews. If I intend to exam-
ine this alleged ambiguity, my main objective however is 
not simply to point out the fallacy surrounding the construc-
tion of the problem. The aim of this paper is rather to lo-
cate what motivates the worries that produce Williams’ 
problematic, the question that lies beneath it (something I 
consider a crucial issue in Wittgenstein’s work). 
In order to develop this matter, I will start by describing 
briefly how the idealist or more precisely the transcenden-
tal idealist problem is presented. The focus will be the 
pathway from the Tractatus to the Investigations and the 
allegedly transformation of the debate surrounding the “I” 
and solipsism into a dispute involving the pronoun “we” 
and relativism.  
1. From “I” to “We” 
Williams recognizes Wittgenstein’s transcendental idealism 
in the persistency of a problem between the Tractatus and 
the Investigations. This problem is grounded in the well-
known maxim from paragraph 5.6 “The limits of my lan-
guage means the limits of my world” (Wittgenstein 1998). 
In order to place this statement inside Wittgenstein’s pro-
ject, we must prevent a certain solipsist interpretation, 
which would take it as purporting the idea that the limits of 
an empirical individual’s language are the limits of his par-
ticular world, as well as its consequence: mind’s singular 
and incommunicable features. As uttered in the Tractatus, 
this sentence points in another direction, it suggests the 
limits of the world as the limits shared with language’s es-
sence, its logical structure. Leaving behind the empirical 
subject interpretation, the homology between world and 
language depicted in the ‘picture theory’ establishes an 
equivalence among what can be said, what can be con-
ceived and what is logically possible. It suggests the im-
possibility of saying that which is not part of the world: 
“There is x and y in the world, but not z”. To say what does 
not exist is nothing but crossing the limits of what makes 
sense: there is, thus, a correspondence between what 
makes sense and the limits of the world. The bounds of 
the world are the bounds of sense. 
What is at stake is not an empirical matter and that is the 
point Williams wants to highlight. Two main aspects follow 
from that: 1) Wittgenstein is not questioning the reality of 
the objects we presume to exist, but the possibility to con-
ceive their existence. Williams’ emphasis lies precisely in 
the question about who conceives the conceivable. 2) The 
“I” referred to by the “my” in the Tractatus’ proposition can-
not be equivalent to a “knowing self in the world”, to the 
“human soul with which psychology deals”. To treat it in 
this way would be treating a logical problem as a psycho-
logical one, as Frege would say. It would be considering 
the problem of the existence of the world as a problem 
about the apprehension of sense data, something that 
would open the door to a bad kind of solipsism (probably 
making the Tractatus a less interesting book in the eyes of 
the logical positivists).          
The fundamental point is, then, the personal pronoun’s 
interpretation: we must exclude the empirical hypothesis 
that it refers to an “I” in the world. Instead, it should be un-
derstood as an “I” whose limits are the same as the limits 
of the world, in such a way that it is not possible to ask 
about its location in the world or, in other words, in such a 
way that the question about the “I” in the world is nothing 
but nonsense. Language’s essence as the boundaries of a 
non-empirical “I” constitutes, then, the Tractatus’ transcen-
dental element, which, in that precise interpretation, indi-
cates the truth in solipsism: not an empirical, but a tran-
scendental “I”. 
The road from the Tractatus to the Investigation, as Wil-
liams sees it, represents the movement that transforms the 
personal pronoun in paragraph 5.6 from the first person 
singular to the first person plural. The reason for the trans-
formation from “I” to “we”, its goal, is solipsism’s final exor-
cism, its repudiation even in the transcendental version 
admitted in the Tractatus. Nevertheless, this movement 
happens, at least in Williams’ thesis, inside the same 
framework, which means the conservation of idealism. 
“The shift from ‘I’ to ‘we’ takes place within the transcen-

dental ideas themselves. From the Tractatus’ combination 
(…) of empirical realism and transcendental solipsism, the 
move does not consist just in the loss of the second ele-
ment. Rather, the move is to something which itself con-
tains an important element of idealism” (Williams 1981).  
So the chief constituent of the tension present in the 
Tractatus reappears renewed as the ambiguity of a “we” 
caught between the depictions (or suppositions) of actual 
human groups present in the world and a new (or old) ide-
alist element. It is through the description of that dispute 
that it is possible to delineate this element and to locate 
the main point about Wittgenstein’s alleged idealism. Fol-
lowing Williams’ argumentation, we will find exactly the 
same positions that organized the previous problem, now 
occupied by new characters. If the solipsists’ mistake was 
the equivalence of a given individual’s language and his 
world, the conversion of an individual into a group (“I” into 
“we”) bears the risk of making the limits of a particular 
group the limits of its world. Therefore, solipsism’s threat 
becomes relativism’s menace. Wittgenstein’s examples in 
the Investigations about hypothetical tribes whose rational-
ity seems sui generis would represent, thus, specific ways 
of thinking determined by each community’s unique lan-
guage. The single individual isolation becomes the inac-
cessibility of different groups and the problem of the in-
communicability of the mind reappears: how can we un-
derstand different minds, minds with singular concepts de-
rived from their particular languages? If the limits of our 
world are the limits of our language, it implies that “we” 
exist as opposed to “them” and we are stuck with the prob-
lem of accessibility: is “their” worldview accessible? 
It is precisely as a response to this problem that the sup-
position of Wittgenstein’s idealism is to be found. The 
claim about his idealism is an opposition to a relativistic 
interpretation taken as solipsism’s heir. As I said, it sup-
poses multiple worldviews, in such a way that these views 
constitute autonomous conceptual structures (to the point I 
am trying to make, it does not matter that it is embodied 
language as a social practice that determines the world-
view). The resistance against relativism, as a type of hy-
perbolic solipsism, has the task of finding a way to prevent 
its dangerous consequence, conceptual isolation, and the 
way to do so is to attack the “other minds” assumption. 
The assertion of transcendental idealism emerges as the 
appeal to one and only rational ground to human experi-
ence, as the possibility of a shared understanding of the 
world. It is the warrant of a universal “we”. As Williams dis-
plays this problem, it becomes an avatar of the problem 
present in the Tractatus and his solution is the uttering of a 
similar answer to a similar question. The “we” personifies 
the same limits represented by the “I” in the Tractatus: the 
frontier between sense and nonsense that delineates the 
conceivable. “Leaving behind the confused and confusing 
language of relativism, one finds oneself with a we which is 
not one group rather than another in the world at all, but 
rather the plural descendant of that idealist I who also was 
not one item rather than another in the world.” (Williams 
1981). However, we should not forget that the Tracatatus’ 
idealist “I” did not exist apart from the ‘picture theory’. 
2. A transcendental inquiry? 
What must be understood is the fact that this way of de-
veloping the problem is founded upon a symmetry estab-
lished between two ideas: “Language does not mean the 
language of an individual” and “Language does not mean 
the language of a group”. It allegedly advocates in both 
cases a wider view about language, one that does not re-
duce it to a mere system of signs. However, despite the 
emphasis in the substitution of the pronoun, the similarity 
of the two propositions reveals a common conception. The 
emphasis on the shift from “I” to “we” conceals the mainte-
nance of a similar view about language. It suggests the 
existence of an essence, which would structure language, 
and therefore thought, regardless of each language’s sys-
tem or, in the case of the Investigations, of each particular 
practice or “way of life”. It is the recognition of a transcen-
dental idealistic element, which occurs amidst the preser-
vation of the Tractatus’ equivalence between the limits of 
language and the limits of the world. “Under the idealist 
interpretation, it is not a question of our recognizing that 
we are one lot in the world among others (…) Rather, what 
the world is for us is shown by the fact that we can make 
sense of some things and not of others: or rather (…) in 
the fact that some things and not others make sense” (Wil-
liams 1981). 
Therefore, this idealist feature of the second Wittgen-
stein exists only if we presuppose the conservation of the 
Tractatus notion of essence, or at least the kind of function 
it occupied as responsible for a common ground for ration-
ality. That is the idealist demand: even if we do consider 
different human practices that follow bizarre rules and 
therefore imply strange language-games, they must all 
inhabit the same rational limits -  the boundaries of the 
universal idealist “we”. That is also, why Williams’ main 
example about the need for a common ground is (not at all 
surprisingly) the concept of truth.  
The point I would like to stress is that beneath this prob-
lematic hypothesis about Wittgenstein’s idealism, lies an 
important interrogation: if we renounce the idea of a fun-
damental conceptual structure to our worldview, what 
guarantees a common ground for the judgments about the 
world? How can we say something about it that may be 
formulated and justified with common principles? Never-
theless, if the appeal to idealism wants to be a serious at-
tempt to solve this matter, it must face the Investigation’s 
critique on the very notion of essence: §97 “We are under 
the illusion that what is peculiar, profound and essential to 
us in our investigation resides in its trying to grasp the in-
comparable essence of language. That is, the order exist-
ing between the concepts of proposition, word, inference, 
truth, experience and so forth.” (Wittgenstein 2009) 
What this paragraph shows is precisely that the pronoun 
“we” cannot be the heir of the Tractatus’ “I”. Following Wil-
liams’ footsteps, Lear recognizes the tension between the 
critique on the notion of essence and the appeal to tran-
scendental idealism: “I suggest that we go back to Kant’s 
definition and loosen it, so that a nonempirical inquiry into 
rule-following may count as a transcendental investigation. 
Wittgenstein’s later philosophy can then be seen as some-
thing like a transcendental inquiry even though it displays 
no interest in necessary structures” (Lear 1998) 
What follows from these two excerpts is that an inquiry 
into the rules of a game, a grammatical inquiry, cannot 
provide in any way an answer to the claim for a rational 
foundation that would go beyond the rules themselves. It 
cannot find metalogical concepts. Which is to say that the 
question about a common ground for rationality has to stay 
within the limits of a language game, has to be reformu-
lated into a question about how “we”, those who are play-
ing a language game, employ the same concepts and talk 
about the same reality. In the limited space of this paper, I 
can only indicate that important question. However, follow-
ing this line of thought, it becomes clear that there is no 
ambiguity in the use of the personal pronoun in the Inves-
tigations. The dispute about “we”, thus, is neither about 
what humanity can say about the world nor about the way

different empirical groups do it, but about what is said in a 
given occasion. “We”, in Wittgenstein’s texts, has the same 
status of any other word, and must be defined inside a 
move in a language game. In the end, if Wittgenstein is 
discussing truth, “we” has its extension delimited by the 
very definition of this concept: truth being part of a lan-
guage-game in a determined way, whoever plays that 
game will constitute the extension of “we”.

“Ceci n’est pas une ontologie”  
A contribution to a quasi-resolute reading of the  
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 
Marco Carapezza & Roberta Rocca

Abstract 
The opening remarks of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus seem to outline the bases of an atomistic ontological theory. For the 
resolute interpreters, such an ontology should be considered as mere part of the set of nonsensical propositions that make up 
the parody of a semantic theory. However, resolute readers share with the traditional views an essentialist reading of the onto-
logical section, according to which Wittgenstein's remarks are intended to build up a real, though parodistic, atomistic ontology. 
By contrast, textual evidence supports the idea that the basic notion of Wittgenstein’s ontology, i.e. the notion of object, should 
be considered as an intra-linguistic, rather than an ontological one. In this paper, we want to show how some of the main claims 
of the resolute readings could be fruitfully  combined with the analyses of Tractarian objects that illustrate them as the semantic 
roles of names. 
 
 
1. Resolute and substantial readings: two 
perspectives of the ontological section  
In the opening remarks of the Tractatus Logico-
Philosophicus, Wittgenstein seems to outline the bases of 
an ontological theory. Objects (Gegenstände) are indi-
cated as the simple elements (TLP, 2.02) which make up 
the substance of the world (TLP, 2.021). However, every 
object is to be conceived in relation to the set of articulate 
configurations, i.e. states of affairs (Sachverhalte), it can 
occur in (TLP, 2.0121, 2.0122, 2.0123). 
Straightforward though it may seem, the ontological sec-
tion gives rise to several interpretative problems. Among 
them, the nature of simples has been one of the most con-
troversial issues. Since Wittgenstein does not give any 
definition or relevant example, how should his claims upon 
objects be seen? What is fundamentally at stake here is 
whether we should consider objects as some sort of inde-
pendent entities (e.g.: atoms, sense data) for which names 
stand or, rather, whether we should identify them in rela-
tion to semantic criteria. 
More generally, a problem arises in trying to define the 
role of the whole ontological section in the Tractatus. In-
deed, Wittgenstein’s world exhibits a close parallel with the 
features of language described in the subsequent remarks 
in the work. Max Black has summarized this correspon-
dence as follows: 
[the world] is a mosaic of independent items – the 
‘atomic facts’; each of these is like a chain in which ‘ob-
jects’ (logical simples) ‘hang in one another’; the objects 
are connected in a network of logical possibilities [...]; 
the simplest ‘elementary’ propositions are pictures of 
atomic facts, themselves facts in which names are con-
catenated, and all other propositions are truth-functions 
of the elementary ones; language is the great mirror in 
which the logical network is reflected, ‘shown’ (Black 
1964: 3). 
Such an account is by no means unambiguous. At first 
glance, Wittgenstein really seems to provide an atomistic 
ontology in order to describe the relation of correspon-
dence between logical pictures, i.e. propositions, and 
facts. Consequently, Wittgenstein’s picture theory is to be 
seen as a semantic theory of correspondence in which he 
tries to single out the criteria that a proposition should 
meet in order to depict a fact. Thus, according to this clas-
sical view, the Tractatus describes the relation between 
language and world from a point of view in which the au-
thor stands “outside the mirror” and sets the requirements 
for an isomorphic correspondence between facts and pic-
tures (Stenius 1960). 
Nevertheless, the traditional view of the role of ontology 
does not match some fundamental assumptions of the 
Tractatus, as no “angelic point of view” (Maslow 1961: 
148) upon language is consistent with the general per-
spective of TLP. This point has been put under the spot-
light by the so-called resolute readers of the Tractatus. 
According to resolute interpretations, the aim of the Trac-
tatus is to free us from the temptation to analyse language 
from the peculiar “sideways on” point of view (Diamond 
1988: 185) which lies behind all sorts of philosophical con-
fusion. Since language is the transcendental and species-
specific cognitive device by which we access the world (Lo 
Piparo 1999: 194), we cannot station ourselves outside 
logic, within which only we can see the world as “mirrored”. 
Putting this in other words,  
in our ability to apprehend a fact we have a sort of a 
priori knowledge, which there is no way of expressing. 
In our awareness of the essence of a proposition we 
are aware of the essence of a fact and thus of the es-
sence of the world (5.4711). Further, in our knowledge 
of any fact there is implicit all our a priori knowledge of 
logical truth (5.47, cf. 3.42) and Wittgenstein certainly 
thinks that logic shows us or mirrors for us something 
about the world (5.511, 6.12, 6.124, 6.13) (McGuinness 
1966: 156). 
Therefore, we cannot represent the world as it is per se, 
whatever this could mean, nor can we speak about “what 
[propositions] must have in common with reality in order to 
be able to represent it” (TLP, 4.12). What resolute readers 
stress is that, as Wittgenstein will later put it, “we cannot 
use language to go outside language” (PR, §6). 
Consequently, from a resolute point of view, the ontology 
of the Tractatus should be properly considered as part of 
the set of merely nonsensical propositions that make up 
the parody of a semantic theory throughout the book. Such 
a mock theory is aimed to act as a self-contradictory de-
vice that shows how any attempt to sketch a picture-theory

47
based on correspondence leads to nothing more than 
nonsense.  
2. The weaknesses of resolute accounts of 
the opening section 
What traditional and resolute views share is, to some ex-
tent, an essentialist reading of the ontological section. In 
this connection, both would agree with Black’s account in 
recognizing that what lies on the surface of Wittgenstein’s 
remarks is a real atomistic ontology, although the former 
read it as a sequence of substantial claims, while the latter 
stress its ironical function. Resolute readers seem to ac-
cept the idea that Wittgenstein is describing the features of 
an independent ontology and then stating the criteria of 
correspondence with language in order to lure the reader 
into a metaphysical illusion (Diamond 2000). The sort of 
elucidation the ontological section is carrying out works 
exactly like the rest of the book: it affects the reader’s 
imagination and then it turns out to be self-ironical, though 
therapeutic, gibberish. 
Undoubtedly, this interpretation succeeds in avoiding 
some of the contradictions of the traditional readings and 
stresses the importance of a key point, namely the impos-
sibility of an external perspective upon language repeat-
edly stated by Wittgenstein (see TLP, Preface, 5.6, 5.61). 
On the other hand, many interpreters have highlighted 
some critical issues. First, resolute readers do not give a 
coherent explanation of how merely nonsensical proposi-
tions could perform any elucidatory task. Moreover, reso-
lute accounts of the opening section of the Tractatus fail as 
they read it as the setting of a pure ontological theory 
which has to be eventually rejected as a whole, whereas 
textual evidence supports the idea that the basic notion of 
Wittgenstein’s ontology, i.e. the notion of object, is an in-
tra-linguistic, rather than an ontological one. 
What we want to show here is how some of the main 
claims of the resolute readings could fit in, in a fruitful and 
consistent way, with the analyses of Tractarian objects that 
illustrate it as the semantic roles of names. Such a theo-
retical combination will help to shed light on how the 
therapeutic function of the opening section actually works. 
3. A quasi-resolute analysis of Tractarian 
objects 
As mentioned above, the status of objects is far from un-
problematic. In the Tractatus, no definitions or examples 
are given that could clarify how it should be seen. Wittgen-
stein merely asserts that the very existence of objects is to 
be founded on a semantic requirement (TLP, 2.0201, 
2.0211), namely the determinateness of the sense of a 
proposition (TLP, 3.23). This indication should not be con-
sidered as a trivial or secondary feature, as the fundamen-
tal element of the ontology is directly derived from a fea-
ture of language. If we take it as the core aspect, it pro-
vides a key to understanding both how name, reference 
and object are linked and how the opening section can act 
as a philosophical therapy. 
Concerning the first point, in order to define what an ob-
ject is, we should take into account the semantic role of 
the name of which it is the reference. According to Brian 
McGuinness, “the semantic role of the name is that of be-
ing combined with other simple signs or names to produce 
a proposition having a truth-value. Any sign which in the 
same combination will produce exactly the same truth-
value is the same sign or has the same reference” (1984: 
87). Two consequences can be drawn from this way of 
dealing with Tractarian objects. 
Firstly, the Bedeutung of a name is to be conceived 
merely as the role of that sign in the context of meaningful 
propositions (Ishiguro 1969). This is a crucial point for any 
resolute reading, as it clearly shows a connection between 
the Tractatus and the Philosophical Investigations in the 
notion of meaning as use.  
Secondly, it states that two signs refer to the same ob-
ject, i.e. have the same Bedeutung, if and only if they have 
the same semantic role in a proposition. Hence, an object 
can be defined in terms of semantic equivalence as the 
way a name contributes to determining the truth conditions 
of a meaningful proposition. No bearer must be there for a 
name to have a reference: “the object it refers to, the ref-
erence of a name, is fixed, because the semantic property 
of the name is fixed. The object itself, the bearer of the 
name […] is neither fixed nor unchanging” (Ishiguro 2001: 
30).  
4. Back to common language: the unfolding 
of an anti-metaphysical therapy 
Now we can easily move to the second of the above men-
tioned consequences of McGuinness’s thesis, which is 
more of a general kind. According to his view, “there is al-
ready contained in language and thought the possibility of 
all objects that are possible. All logical forms are logically 
possible within language, within thought.” Thus, “no sepa-
rate investigation or exploration of ‘reality’ is conceivable” 
(McGuinness 1984: 91), no “sideways on” point of view is 
achievable, and no theory of correspondence can be 
given. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, “the idea that 
‘logic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also its 
limits’ is not, therefore, a metaphysical claim about the 
necessary correlation between two systems – the world on 
one side and language on the other […]. It is not a proof 
that language necessarily fits the world, but a form of rec-
ognition that there is no gap to be bridged”. It is only in this 
sense that “world is mirrored in language; logical form is 
the form of reality” (McGinn 1999: 511). 
If so, however, we are led back to the primary question 
of our essay. If no ontology can be given, what could the 
opening remarks of the Tractatus aim at? Following 
McGuinness’s insights, it is now clear that Wittgenstein is 
surely not trying to build up an ontological theory that 
would later support a theory of correspondence between 
pictures and facts, nor is he trying to infer the features of 
the world from the features of our language. In fact, what 
Wittgenstein is talking about when he refers to objects is 
not a set of entities belonging to the realm of reality; he is 
rather evoking a semantic notion.  
Undoubtedly, the opening remarks of the Tractatus re-
semble a metaphysical theory based upon logic, for they 
borrow its traditional vocabulary. However, behind this ap-
pearance, a mere projection of linguistic items is con-
cealed. In so doing, Wittgenstein is trying to develop an 
introductory myth through which the reader begins to get a 
feel for some characteristics of propositions (McGinn 1999: 
500).  
At the same time, this is exactly the way the Tractatus 
starts acting as a therapy: our tendency to misuse some 
words (e.g. object, world, fact) in a metaphysical way, 
which relies on the abstract illusion of an “angelic point of 
view” external to language, is what Wittgenstein is ad-
dressing here. His method consists in restating a proper

 48
use of these words, thus bringing them back within the all-
pervading domain of commonly spoken language. As a 
consequence, the reader is led back to focus on common 
language and freed from the temptation of the philosophi-
cal perspective. 
On this point, the proposition by which the Tractatus 
makes the transition from the so-called ontological section 
to the introduction of Bild cooperates in supporting our in-
terpretation: if “we picture facts to ourselves” (TLP, 2.1), 
then no access to the world is given in isolation from the 
logic that rules our language. If any correspondence be-
tween language and world is to be stated, it cannot be 
conceived as a mere parallel. As Wittgenstein will later put 
it, language accompanies the world: all we have to do is 
criss-cross it from the inside.

Wittgenstein’s critique of “the strong causal account”– the case of 
seeing aspects 
Hei Fai Alva Chun 
Hong Kong, China | alva729@gmail.com  
Abstract 
In his several later writings, Ludwig Wittgenstein persistently addresses a problem which is called “the confusion in psychology”. 
This essay aims at arguing that Wittgenstein's main target of the critique of the confusion in psychology is not merely some 
particular explanations offered by these psychologists, but the unified methodological assumption which I call “the strong causal 
account”, which is a common methodological assumption of these psychologies. In the first section, I will first introduce 
Wittgenstein’s view that this assumption is a general confusion in psychology. In the second section, I will clarify the defining 
characteristics of the assumption. In the third section, I will turn to the case of seeing aspects to explain his three arguments 
rejecting the causal explanation of visual phenomenon provided by psychologist Köhler, which plays a significant role in his 
general project of critique of the causal explanation of mental phenomenon.. 
 
 
1. The methodological assumption of the 
strong causal account as a general con-
fusion of psychology 
Wittgenstein claims that we cannot explain a wide range of 
mental phenomena in terms of casual explanation. Let us 
see three examples: First, when he talks about feeling, he 
says “In the very case where I'd express my joy like this: 
‘The trees and the sky and the birds make me feel good all 
over’--still what's in question here is not causation, nor 
empirical concomitance, etc. etc.” (RPP II §322) Second, 
when he talks about the reason of playing certain game, 
he says “Why in the world do we play this game!--But what 
are we after here? The game's surroundings, not its 
causes.” (LW I §250) Third, when he talks about how the 
phenomenon of pretending is possible, he even claims that 
“It is a purely geometric way of looking at things, as it 
were. One into which cause and effect do not enter.” The 
other mental phenomena which Wittgenstein thinks cannot 
be explained in terms of casual explanation includes: see-
ing asepcts (PI p.193, p.201), knowing meaning (PI §198), 
having justification (PI §217), having reason (PI §475), will-
ing (PI §613), acting (PI §631) inclining (PI §216), having 
motive(PI p.225; RPP II §175), feeling (RPP II §322).  
Also, the above critiques of causal explanation in particu-
lar cases cannot be treated as separated issues, as we 
can see that there are textual evidences to claim that Witt-
genstein thinks that a version of casual explanation of 
mental phenomenon as such is problematic. He does not 
mean that causal explanation helps nothing in explaining 
mental phenomena. What he argues against is the claim 
that any mental phenomena can be explained in terms of 
causal explanation. Let me call this thesis “the strong 
causal account”. 
First, in Wittgenstein's later writings, the strong causal 
account is equivalent to physiological explanation of men-
tal phenomenon (also be called as “psycho-physical paral-
lalism”), which claims that psychological phenomena can 
be investigated physiologically (RPP I §906). We can see 
from his remarks that the two concepts are equivalent. On 
the one hand, he thinks that to deny psycho-physical par-
allalism is to “upset our concepts of causality” (RPP I 
§905); on the other hand, he thinks that to state that a 
problem is not causal implies that the problem is not 
physiological (PI p.203). Thus, we can see they are neces-
sary and sufficient condition to each other so that the 
strong causal account is equivalent to “psycho-physical 
parallalism” in Wittgenstein's later writings. Furthermore, 
he thinks that this is deeply problematic, because “It is per-
fectly possible that certain psychological phenomena can-
not be investigated physiologically, because physiologi-
cally nothing corresponds to them.” Wittgenstein thinks 
psychology generally falls into this mistake, which he calls 
“the confusion is psychology” (RPP I §1039; cf. PI p.232) 
Wittgenstein claims “Psychology connects what is experi-
enced with something physical” (ROC §234). Even this 
psycho-physical parallalism “is extremely dangerous in 
connexion with the clarification of conceptual problems in 
psychology.” says Wittgenstein:  
“Thinking in physiological hypotheses deludes us some-
times with false difficulties, sometimes with false solu-
tions. The best prophylactic against this is the thought 
that I don't know at all whether the humans I am ac-
quainted with actually have a nervous system.”(RPP I, 
§1063) 
Second, in The blue book, Wittgenstein claims that “the 
activities of the mind lie open before us.” (BB p.6) How-
ever, the causal explanation treats the mental process as 
hidden from us (BB p.7). So it is obvious to claim that Witt-
genstein thinks that the method of the strong causal ac-
count cannot properly understand the activities of mind in 
general. These evidences sufficiently show that Wittgen-
stein thinks the strong causal account as such is problem-
atic. 
2. The defining characteristics of the strong 
causal account 
In the previous section, we have already seen that the 
strong causal account is equivalent to “psycho-physical 
parallalism”. Now I will argue that there are two character-
istics of the strong causal account: epistemologically hid-
den and metaphysically nomological. Doubtlessly, these 
characteristics are shared by physical causation. 
First, Wittgenstein concretely explains the process of the 
strong causal account by analogy to biological explanation. 
He thinks in biological explanation, scientists usually posit 
conjecture some medium which is very different from other 
organism to explain the queer biological phenomena, e.g. 
an amoeba splits up into similar cells, each of which grows 
and behaves like the original one. The medium plays the 
role of linking the casual chain in the explanation. Wittgen-
stein thinks the important feature of these kinds of medium

is that they are hidden from us. We must postulate this 
hidden mechanism by experiments. However, Wittgenstein 
thinks the activities of the mind lie open before us (BB p.6). 
This epistemological feature of causality sheds light to 
Wittgenstein's several remarks about causes. As we can't 
know the cause directly, Wittgenstein says “Of the cause 
one can say that one can't know it but can only conjecture 
it.” (BB, p.15) And the causal explanation can only give 
hypothesis (BB p.14, p.88; PI §325; LW I §795; cf. PI 
p.206). Also, the causes are merely possible (RPP I §46; 
cf. PI p.230) and irrelevant to certainty (PI§325) Hence, “It 
is the task of the experimental sciences to test such hy-
potheses.” (BB p.88; PI§169) 
Second, the causes are metaphysically nomological. 
Wittgenstein states that “Causation is surely something 
established by experiments, by observing a regular con-
comitance of events for example.”(PI §169) And this regu-
larity is lawful in the sense of possessing necessity in na-
ture: “What is insidious about the causal approach is that it 
leads one to say: ‘Of course, that's how it has to happen’. 
Whereas one ought to say: It may have happened like 
that, in many other ways.”(CV p.45) Therefore, causal ex-
planation can be predictive.(RPP I §46; cf. PI p.230) In 
order to explain the origin of this nomological image of 
causality, Wittgenstein says: “…our imagining that the 
causal nexus is the connexion of two machine parts by 
means of a mechanism, say a train of cogwheels.” (PI 
§613) 
3. The critique of the strong causal account 
by clarifying the phenomenon of seeing 
aspects 
Wittgenstein deals with the phenomenon of seeing aspect 
extensively in his later works. The basic problem of this 
phenomenon is that when we notice an aspect in visual 
experience, the object of vision seems to have changed 
and yet seems not to have changed (PI p.193-5; LW I 
§493), which is quite paradoxical. For example, when we 
see the duck-rabbit picture we can see that the picture 
change between duck picture and rabbit picture but at the 
same time we are aware that the picture remains un-
changed. 
Stephen Mulhall claims that the issue of seeing aspect 
“continues to be one of the least explored and least under-
stood of the major themes in his later philosophy.”
 (Mulhall 
2001, p.246) In recent years, there were more commenta-
tors who emphasize the role of seeing aspect in Wittgen-
stein’s later philosophy. Some commentators, e.g. Mullhall, 
P.F. Strawson and Brian O'Shaughnessy, claim that the 
purpose of discussing this phenomenon is to illustrate the 
ubiquity of “seeing-as” as the unavoidable nature of visual 
experience. (Mullhall 1990 p.255; Strawson 1974 p.58; 
O'Shaughnessy 2012 p.42)  However, Severin Schroeder 
disagrees Mulhall's interpretation that Schroeder thinks 
Wittgenstein emphasizes the changing moment of seeing 
aspect, which Wittgenstein calls “dawning an aspect” (PI 
§194) and Schroeder calls the ephemeral sense of seeing 
aspects, but not the stable aspect perception. He thinks 
Wittgenstein’s purpose is to deal with the problem “How (or 
in what sense) is it possible to experience an aspect (a 
thought, the meaning of a picture) in an instant?”
  Though 
Schroeder points out the true emphasis in the discussion 
of seeing aspect, I think there is one important purpose of 
discussing this changing moment remains least explored – 
the critique of the strong causal account. 
Wittgenstein’s discussion of seeing aspect is in the con-
text of criticizing Köhler’s explanation of this phenomenon. 
Firstly, Köhler thinks the different figures in the aspect per-
ception are some “organizations”, which are sensory facts 
just like colour and shape, which were a matter of physiol-
ogy. (Köhler 1970, p.318) Secondly, Köhler thinks the or-
ganizations are determined by the nervous system” 
(Köhler 1970 pp.199-200), which means patterns of neural 
activation cause different organization. These theses obvi-
ously take the strong causal account for granted. 
Wittgenstein provides many arguments in his later writ-
ings to defeat Köhler's explanation, for example, he criti-
cizes the concept of inner object, and shows the contradic-
tion in the analogy of picture. (c.f. Schroeder 2010 p.361) 
In order to stick closely to the theme of this paper, I will not 
explain all of them, but will concentrate on three argu-
ments related to the general critique of the strong causal 
account. In this essay I attempt to label these three argu-
ments as “the impossibility of definitely complete descrip-
tion argument”, “the condition of agent's will argument” and 
“the refuting ghostly mental nature argument”. The first 
argument attacks the first thesis noted above by Köhler. 
This argument shows that we cannot accomplish some 
definitely complete description of the content of aspect in 
the same way as color and shape. This entails that the 
basis of causal explanation cannot be built up. The second 
thesis attacks the nomological explanation of this phe-
nomenon. The third argument shows that Wittgenstein 
does not face the problem of substance dualism.  
The first argument runs as follows. Wittgenstein claims 
that aspects are not like color and shape in the sense that 
we cannot give it once and for all the possible kinds of as-
pects by studying nervous system. (RPP I §1116) Not only 
the description of the content of aspect cannot be com-
pleted definitely by studying nervous system, Wittgenstein 
even claims that our description of what is seen may al-
ways be incomplete, if there is still something to ask. (RPP 
I §1023, PI, p.199) Thus Wittgenstein claims that the con-
tent in seeing aspects is not “empirical proposition” 
(PI§208, (RPP II §545), which means the description of a 
property like colour can gain a definite truth-value, the de-
scription of seeing aspects cannot gain a definite truth-
value. Why is it the case? Wittgenstein thinks the new in-
formation gained in “aspect dawning” would affect the 
completeness of the description of those perception in 
part. He explains this in the following remark: 
“Suppose someone had always seen faces with only 
one expression, say a smile. And now, for the first time, 
he sees a face changing its expression. Couldn't we 
say here that he hadn't noticed a facial expression until 
now? Not until the change took place was the expres-
sion meaningful; earlier it was simply part of the anat-
omy of the face.--Is that the way it is with the aspect of 
the letter? Expression could be said to exist only in the 
play of the features.” (RPP II §356) 
Thus one might think that one has given a final complete 
description of what is really seen at T1. But after one has 
acquired the skill of recognizing a face by observing the 
change of aspects at T2, one would notice that he cannot 
recognize an important aspect of the things. Hence, when 
we have noticed a new aspect, any given description of 
past visual perception may be incomplete. Thus we can 
see the significance of the phenomenon of “aspect dawn-
ing” here. Since the experience of aspect dawning brings 
forth a different kind of description of perception, and so a 
different criteria of completeness of description of percep-
tion. Thus Wittgenstein concludes: 

Wittgenstein’s critique of “the strong causal account”– the case of seeing aspects | Hei Fai Alva Chun 
 
 
 
51
“It occurs to someone: If I only had the right things and 
colours at my disposal, I could exactly represent what I 
see. And up to a point it actually is so. And that report 
of what I have before me, and the description of what I 
see, have the same form.--But they quite leave out, 
e.g., the wandering of the gaze. Not that alone, though, 
but also, e.g., the reading of a script in the visual field 
and any aspect of what is seen.” (RPP I §953) 
When we believe that we have described exactly what we 
see, it just leaves out the aspects in that experience. This 
point seems to be sufficient to defeat Köhler's assumption 
that aspect is a definite sensory fact which can be given a 
complete description, and after that we can establish the 
causal explanation of aspect perception.  
The second argument is also based on a conceptual 
clarification of aspect dawning. Wittgenstein claims that 
choosing different aspects to see the same picture is, at 
least to a certain degree, subject to the will. (RPP I §971) 
He says: 
“‘The aspect is subject to the will.’ This isn't an empirical 
proposition. It makes sense to say, ‘See this circle as a 
hole, not as a disc’, but it doesn't make sense to say 
‘See it as a rectangle’, ‘See it as being red’”(RPP II 
§545)  
In this remark Wittgenstein argues that only in the back-
ground of awareness of many possibilities that we can 
have the experience of changing between aspects. And 
this background of awareness of many possibilities is de-
pended on the role of our will. Thus, only by the effect of 
will can changing aspect possible. Here Wittgenstein offers 
a two-layer account of visual perception which satisfies our 
intuition that perception is necessitated by physical law, 
e.g. optical principle, and at the same time shows that per-
ception is not only necessitated by natural fact. At the level 
of color and shape, the content of perception should be 
necessitated by physical law. But at the level of aspects, 
causal explanation is not enough to explain the phenom-
ena. We must employ the concept of will to explain the 
awareness of possibility. 
Now I am going to demonstrate the third argument. Witt-
genstein thinks the motive of those psychologists to pro-
pose the strong causal account is that they don’t want to 
posit a mysterious mental substance in explaining mental 
phenomena, which Wittgenstein views as false dichotomy: 
“The prejudice in favour of psycho-physical parallalism 
is also a fruit of the primitive conception of grammar. 
For when one admits a causality between psychological 
phenomena, which is not mediated physiologically, one 
fancies that in doing so one is making an admission of 
the existence of a soul alongside the body, a ghostly 
mental nature.” (RPP I §906) 
Wittgenstein rejects both the Cartesian concept of mental 
substance and the causal medium in the strong causal 
account, since two opposite views are also depended on 
“something hidden from us”. By contrast, Wittgenstein 
thinks that we can understand our mental phenomena by 
publicly observable “fine shades of behavior”. 
Wittgenstein's concept of “fine shades of behavior” is a 
methodological guidance, which suggests that behavioral 
expression is the criteria to distinguish different mental 
phenomena.(PI p.204) For example, when I see the rab-
bit's head in the duck-rabbit picture, I may exclaim “Now it 
is a rabbit!”. The reaction of “Now it is...!” is different from 
the expression of mere report.(PI p.197) Thus, actually we 
can use the publicly observable criteria to understand our 
mental phenomena better. In this process we need not 
appeal to hidden medium. From an epistemological point 
of view, the publicly observable behavior is the basis to 
derive any hypothesis in explanation, but not vice versa. In 
this sense behavior is certain and self-sufficient than pos-
tulation. Thus the dilemma of the strong causal claim is 
false. 
6. Conclusion 
In this essay, I have proved that the critique of the strong 
causal account plays an important role in Wittgenstein's 
later philosophy and how his discussion of seeing aspects 
attacks the strong causal account. I also think Wittgen-
stein’s critique addressed here is very similar to the 
method of phenomenological reduction in the tradition of 
phenomenology, which may be worth further explored.

Wittgenstein’s grammar and the contemporary scientific rationality

Abstract 
Wittgenstein’s philosophy was set in a scientific atmosphere in which the rationality of modern science was in broad question-
ing, establishing a kind of crisis of reason. Wittgenstein later philosophy formulated in the Philosophical Investigations can pro-
vide us with rich subsidies for think this crisis of rationality. In particular, in his notion of grammar, we have a key not only to (1) 
“dissolve” the crisis of modern reason, but simultaneously to establish (2) a new rationality demanded by contemporary science, 
that is, how to establish new criteria of rationality that, although no more anchored in ultimate foundation, on the one hand, it 
does not get lost in the extreme relativism on the other. What is intended here is to discuss the possibility of establishing a 
model of scientific rationality based in the later Wittgenstein, especially in his notion of grammar, thus constituting a kind of 
“grammar of science”. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
In the early twentieth century, Wittgenstein’s philosophy 
was set in a scientific atmosphere in which the rationality 
of modern science was in broad questioning, establishing 
a kind of crisis of reason. From this scenario, Wittgen-
stein’s philosophical conclusions reached in the Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus have impacted strongly the Vienna 
Circle, which at that time was rethinking the foundations of 
science. However, by sensing that it was not more possi-
ble affirming the traditional bases of knowledge, Wittgen-
stein has created his later philosophy formulated in the 
Philosophical Investigations. In a certain sense, we can 
say that his later philosophy continued to provide us with 
rich subsidies for think this crisis of rationality. In particular, 
in his notion of grammar, we have a key not only to (1) 
“dissolve” the crisis of modern reason, but simultaneously 
to establish (2) a new rationality demanded by contempo-
rary science. 
One of the most important philosophical aspects and 
with enormous consequence for the science of our time 
arises as follows: although the contemporary science can-
not be configured from the ideas of truth or ultimate foun-
dation, as postulated by modern science, this not imply 
that we no longer need new criteria in the assessment of 
scientific knowledge as well as their uses and implications. 
Which leads us to ask, how to establish new criteria of ra-
tionality to scientific knowledge that, although no more an-
chored in ultimate foundation, on the one hand, it does not 
get lost in the extreme relativism on the other. What is the 
new epistemology for the equation of the philosophical 
problems raised by contemporary science? What is in-
tended here is to discuss the possibility of establishing a 
model of scientific rationality based in the later Wittgen-
stein, especially in his notion of grammar, thus constituting 
a kind of “grammar of science”. 
Naturally, due to the complexity not only of the philoso-
phical aspects of contemporary science, but also the rich 
philosophy of Wittgenstein, this issue cannot be com-
pletely developed within the limits imposed here. However, 
I hope to be contributing to point out from Wittgenstein a 
rich trail of possibilities for contemporary epistemology. 
This new Wittgensteinian model of scientific rationality is 
based, in particular, on his notions of grammar and prag-
matics of language. It appears as a peculiar type of system 
that has as one of its main aspects provide a holistic per-
spective, though it is not as a totalizing metaphysical sys-
tem. Unlike modern scientific rationality – essentialist and 
foundationalist – this new notion of rationality does not 
constitute it in itself from a hierarchical order and a priori. 
At the contrary, it is seen as a “web”, as a flexible and mul-
tidirectional network that extends through family resem-
blances. (PI 67, 77, 108) It is not totalizing because, be-
sides having no ultimate foundation, it is not intended to 
provide “a” total and complete intelligibility of the world, as 
if all worldviews were convergent. However, it is holistic 
because it presents an overview (Übersichtlichkeit) by 
constituting a type of open and decentralized system in 
which rationality is not based on any privileged special 
place, but it is configured from the multiple relationships 
within this system. Although it is a standalone system, it is 
not closed in an extreme relativism because it is open to 
other systems. 
Finally, in the Philosophical Investigation, we find ele-
ments that help us to establish a theory of science to re-
spond the demands that the new contemporary science 
brings about, even though Wittgenstein has not primarily 
reflected the science, but the language. Inspired by Witt-
genstein, one can see language as a model of rationality 
that is opposed to modern reason in order to overcome its 
philosophical problems. Grammar is a central concept in 
this formulation. One can extend this conception of Witt-
gensteinian rationality to science. Science in its modus 
operandi is also a kind of grammar. This grammar of sci-
ence, as a characterization of scientific rationality, allows 
us to think of it as a theory of science. In order to clarify 
this idea, I will try to elucidate some aspects of the gram-
mar in the later Wittgenstein and, subsequently, to show 
how it allows us to think about science. 
2. From grammar to the grammar of science 
According to Wittgenstein, grammar is constituted as a set 
of rules that is formed from the language-games. The use 
within a language-game is not an indiscriminate practice. 
Although relatively free, use is governed by rules that dis-
tinguish the correct use from the incorrect use of words in 
different contexts. These rules are not only linguistic rules, 
but also pragmatic rules, that is, they involve actions. (PI 7) 
And it is the set of such rules that have a dynamic aspect 
and are in continual flow that establishes the grammar. 
Insofar as the grammar, beyond the syntactic and seman-
tic aspects, also incorporates pragmatic aspects, it is in-
serted in the social practice. A rule can only be effectively 
as such by social praxis. Grammar is a social product. It 
remains to note that, in the same way that the use affects 
a rule, on the other hand, this rule will say whether the use 
is correct or not. However, as grammar is a set of rules 

Wittgenstein’s grammar and the contemporary scientific rationality | Mauro Condé

that is open, new rules can be added or old rules change, 
etc. 
Grammar in the later Wittgenstein has so some central 
features. Possibly the most important is exactly to consider 
the rule as a product of social praxis. Based on this point, 
it follow that the rule is a social convention that arises from 
this practice and therefore could be different if this praxis 
were another (or it could be changed from a society – or 
form of live – to another). The rule as an “invention”, a so-
cial creation, does not reflect any kind of transcendental 
essence. It is an “arbitrary” creation and in this sense is an 
“invention”. However, the rule cannot be completely arbi-
trary, since they have to maintain their consistency with all 
other rules and practices, that is, with the complete gram-
mar, “if rule became exception and exception rule; or if 
both became phenomena of roughly equal frequency – this 
would make our normal language-games lose their point”. 
(PI 142) Therefore, the rules come from our “standards” of 
behavior, our habits, customs and institutions. (PI 142, 
199, 202, 226, 227) When we understand the rule as the 
product of a language-game, we conclude the operative 
character of the rule. Follow a rule is an operation – this is 
the pragmatic character of the rule. “To understand a lan-
guage means to be master of a technique”. (PI 199) This is 
not an isolated mental process. “’Obeying a rule’ is a prac-
tice. And to think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a 
rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule ‘privately’: oth-
erwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same 
thing as obeying it.” (PI 202) 
In the Investigations, Wittgenstein distinguishes two lev-
els of grammar: The surface grammar and the depth 
grammar. (PI 664) The surface grammar deals with the 
specific features of the expressions, without taking into 
account the overall grammatical context in which such ex-
pressions are generated, unlike the depth grammar (one 
may say overview grammar), that is, a grammar in which 
the rules of the use of language are engendered, within 
which it operates, like a game, the production of various 
linguistic expressions and, consequently, it creates the 
rationality. Thus, the depth grammar takes into account not 
only the specific aspects of a given language game, but all 
that is involved in the practice of language as, uses, ac-
tions, production of rules, etc. 
Perhaps the general sense of the notion of grammar in 
Wittgenstein could be expressed as follows: logic is ex-
pressed in the rules of grammar. Every logical possibility is 
grammatical. In Investigations, grammar enables the logic, 
grammar is the logic itself. Thus, grammar tells us what is 
logical: what is inside and what is outside the bounds of 
sense (meaningless). “So does it depend wholly on our 
grammar what will be called (logically) possible and what 
not” (PI 520). As most immediate consequence, rationality 
is, first of all, grammatical. Grammar is therefore the set of 
all rules erected from the interaction between language 
and actions in a regular way. 
Not only by the possibility of using the concept of gram-
mar in many areas (grammar of colors, uses, etc.), but the 
association of grammar with Wittgenstein’s notion of insti-
tutions (the institutions of money PI 584; writing and read-
ing, PI 156; system of measures the PI 50, etc.) is that we 
can think the institution of science as a grammar, that is, 
as an institution with a set of rules and practices that en-
close its rationality in itself. In other words, as a grammar, 
science has its values in itself, even if it has “family resem-
blances” with other grammars (politics, arts, religion, etc.). 
In a Wittgensteinian perspective, what circumscribing 
something like scientific, for example, what separating 
medicine from popular healing practices or what establish-
ing the distinction between scientific and non-scientific is 
the set of rules, practices and scientific results, finally, 
what constitutes the “grammar of science”. Once this sci-
entific grammar is an open system with interactions and 
juxtapositions of practices, rules and values, one can even 
say that there are family resemblances between science, 
popular healing practices, religion and politics, etc. Which 
may has an influence on the final product of scientific 
knowledge, but the justification of scientific rationality is in 
its grammar itself. Anyway, as an institution, science has 
specific rules and practices, that is, its grammar. For Witt-
genstein, every rule can be applied only in an institution 
(PI 381, 540), spite of it may be permeated by other values 
of the society in which it operates. These criteria or justifi-
cation of scientific rationality, insofar as they are public and 
not transcendent or merely positive, that is, they are prag-
matic, allows us to have access to this grammar (system of 
reference) in order we can make our choices between dif-
ferent grammars. 
When one need to choose between the grammar of 
medicine and popular healing practice, for example, 
among the public criteria are not only the rules of behavior 
of this different options, but also the effectiveness in 
achieving the intended aims: results, nature’s answer, etc. 
Although our grammar is not reduced to the facts, if facts 
were different, it would also be others our language-
games. Hence our grammar would be different. “If we 
imagine the facts otherwise than as they are, certain lan-
guage-games lose some of their importance, while others 
become important”. (OC 63) In other words, language-
games have their “regularities” (PI 208), also from a kind of 
“order of things”. The language-game of trying to under-
stand the nature is part of science, but not necessarily part 
of other grammars as art or religion. 
This grammatical perspective opens a fruitful way to in-
vestigate epistemological issues highlighted by contempo-
rary sciences. Traditional epistemological problems have a 
possibility to find a good solution from this notion of gram-
mar: such as the problem of foundation of scientific knowl-
edge, relativism, objectivity, etc. Of course, these problems 
are related in complex ways on a theory of science. And it 
is difficult to address them separately. However, for illus-
trative purpose, I will indicate how two of them are seen by 
the grammar of science: the problem of ultimate foundation 
and relativism. 
The modern epistemology had as its central issue the 
problem about the ultimate foundation of science. Carte-
sian rationalism and Baconian empiricism – albeit from 
different perspectives – tried to provide the ultimate foun-
dation of science. According to Wittgenstein, there is no 
ultimate foundation of knowledge, because the value of a 
singular statement, for example, is not due to the positivity 
of the facts or the rational essences, but simply by the 
pragmatic of language or grammar that establishes a sys-
tem of reference for our judging. It is from this pragmatic 
perspective that “our knowledge forms an enormous sys-
tem. And only within this system has a particular bit the 
value we give it”. (OC 410) 
The question for ultimate foundation of knowledge as an 
essence from which we structure our knowledge is the re-
sult of a grammatical illusion. (PI 110, 111, 112) Wittgen-
stein puts the end of the chain of reasons not in the fact or 
a transcendental foundation, but in the pragmatic of our 
language-games, habits and institutions. “Giving grounds,

our acting, which lies at the bottom of the language-game”. 
(OC 204) 
It could be argued that Wittgenstein’s position – in order 
to establish the criteria of our knowledge and judgment in 
grammar and language-games – eventually closing the 
knowledge in relativism, our second problem in focus here. 
However, this was perhaps the biggest misconception at-
tributed to the later Wittgenstein’s philosophy. If grammar 
was impervious to other grammars, in this case, it would 
be relativism, but to the extent that the grammar is an open 
system, we can strongly mitigate this relativism. From our 
grammar, we can establish relationships and criteria for 
understanding other grammars based on approximation 
points. And, above all, we share similarities in the way we 
operate in the world. Although the grammar is where we 
build our judging criteria, you can understand other gram-
mars from our grammar. 
“Suppose you came as an explorer into an unknown 
country with a language quite strange to you. In what 
circumstance would you say that the people there gave 
orders, understood them, obey them, rebelled against 
them, and so on? The common behaviour of the man-
kind is the system of reference by means of which we 
interpret an unknown language (I. F. § 206).” 
The reference for understanding a foreign grammar is not 
only the actions inside this foreign grammar, but also the 
action inside our own grammar that we share and not 
share – family resemblances – with this foreign culture. 
Sure, there is no a common ground between different 
grammars or forms of life in the sense that there is ultimate 
foundation, but simply behaviours, practices, interactions, 
institutions, etc. Thus, some ways of acting that can be 
shared as family resemblances, in greater or lesser extent. 
The criteria of objectivity that emerge from a pragmatic 
perspective are public and, therefore, they can be under-
stood with greater or lesser precision between different 
grammars. 
Finally, in the same way, different scientific theories and 
practices are not necessarily incommensurable. Naturally, 
this does not mean affirm positive facts or transcendental 
metaphysics as the absolute basis of different scientific 
knowledge. Unlike this, the possibility of dialogue between 
different alternatives models of scientific theories is guided 
by the criteria of public pragmatics of language of these 
different grammars.

On the Vagueness of “Know” as a Gradable Term 
Zvonimir Čuljak 
Zagreb, Croatia | zculjak@hrstud.hr 
Abstract 
Epistemic contextualists interpreted the predicate “know” either as indexical, comparable to expressions like “I”, “here” or “this”, 
or as a gradable term, like “tall or “flat”. Mark Heller (1999) categorized “know” as a broadly vague term. In this paper, it is ar-
gued that “know” does behave or can be considered as a vague term, rather than only as indexical or gradable. In contrast to 
Heller's contextualist interpretation, the vagueness of “know” can be explained in a non-contextualist manner by referring to its 
intra-contextual gradability, which is not due to inter-contextually shifting standards. 
 
 
1. “Know” as context sensitive  
Epistemic contextualists, like S. Cohen (1999) and K. 
DeRose (1992), found indicative linguistic evidence for 
their theses about the contextual dependence of knowl-
edge attributions in the semantic properties of the predi-
cate “know”. For contextualists, “know” is context sensitive, 
and its context sensitivity is primarily manifested through 
its indexicality. So, “know” behaves like “I”, “here” or “this” 
(DeRose, 1992), whose meaning, or “content” in D. Kap-
lan’s terms, changes with the context of their utterance, 
while its ”character“ or “linguistic meaning” is invariant.  
Another contextual feature of “know” is its alleged grad-
ability: “know” is comparable to “tall”, “rich”, “flat”, “bald” or 
“happy” and “sad” (D. Lewis 1996; S. Cohen 1999). Grad-
able predicates are used in comparative constructions, like 
“being taller than”, by means of explicit grading, and rela-
tively, or simpliciter, i.e. absolutely, like “tall”. As Cohen 
(1999: 60) claims,  
For predicates of this kind, context will determine the 
degree to which the predicate must be satisfied in order 
for the predicate to apply simpliciter. So the context will 
determine how flat a surface must be in order to be flat. 
The pertinent knowledge claims get their truth-values in 
correlation with those relevant standards. So, epistemic 
predicates, “know” first of all, are satisfied in variable de-
grees, depending on such standards. In Cohen’s opinion, 
gradability of “know” is derived from the gradability of the 
justification component in knowledge. 
By talking simpliciter one covers the degrees, but implic-
itly evokes standards which are contextually variable and 
thus yield grading. This gradability is an inter-contextual 
feature, since epistemic predicates admit grading under 
the assumption of different contexts regulated by different 
standards. 
Both theses about the context sensitivity of “know” have 
been contested from an invariantist point of view (e.g. J. 
Stanley, 2004), though this attempt may be also consid-
ered as controversial (e.g. by B. Partee 2004).  
The gradability analysis has been rejected by F. Dretske 
(1981), albeit in a “material” mode: knowledge is not grad-
able, however, it is also not an absolute property, but “rela-
tionally absolute” like empty. Being empty simpliciter 
amounts to being devoid of all things, while, in a relation-
ally absolute sense, it amounts to being devoid of all rele-
vant things, relevant with respect to the subject context. 
Analogously, knowledge as a relationally absolute property 
is a function of the subject’s ability to eliminate all relevant 
alternatives, not absolutely all alternatives, including the 
skeptical ones. Insisting on the absolute character of 
knowledge leads to the annihilation of knowledge, since 
absolute knowledge is not possible, and, consequently, to 
skepticism (as by P. Unger 1971). On the other hand, ad-
mitting grading of the epistemic strength and only “incon-
clusive reasons” makes knowledge ubiquitous and easily 
held, but never accomplished.  
Another strategy for contextualism is the analysis of 
“know” as a broadly vague predicate, proposed by M. 
Heller (1999: 117-118). It exploits the idea of vaguely re-
ferring predicates to non-vague properties:  
What is relative is “knowledge”, not knowledge. The 
relativity comes from the fact that “knowledge” is vague, 
and that there are not vague properties. What there are 
are non-vague properties referred to vaguely. […] To 
say that the truth of knowledge attributions is context 
relative is also not to say that there is any indetermi-
nacy in S’s condition, but only in our descriptions of her 
condition.  
So, vagueness is a feature of our epistemic discourse in-
cluding predicates such as “know”, not of the property or 
state of knowing, which is context insensitive and thus 
non-vague. Heller is explicit in this respect: having or lack-
ing epistemic properties “does not depend on context in 
any way” (118). Also, 
The property she has and the one she lacks are both 
referents of “knowledge”, the one being referent in one 
context, and the other being referent in the other. They 
are distinct referents, and S’s having the one property 
that is referred to in the one context does not conflict 
with her lacking the other property that is referred to in 
the other context. 
Recognizing vagueness as an essential feature of our 
epistemic language, Heller obviously implied that there are 
epistemic properties, moreover, many different, non-vague 
epistemic properties vaguely referred. So, knowledge itself 
is not vague and not relativized to a context.  
This analysis is not confined to indexicality or gradability, 
though it implicitly includes both of them. It also implies 
realism about epistemic properties referred to by “know”. 
The difficulty with this analysis is that it admits possibly 
many different and equally legitimate epistemic properties 
as referents for “know”. Moreover, although having or lack-
ing any of those epistemic properties is not context de-
pendent, whether any of them is a referent of “know” or 
not, surely does depend on the context in question. So, 
one way or another, “knowledge” and knowledge are sub-
ject to relativism and pluralism. 
The idea that “know” is vague is, nevertheless, followed 
in this paper. Here, however, the vagueness of “know” – as

fuzziness and as admitting borderline cases – is consid-
ered as not necessarily contextually conditioned, but as an 
intra-contextual affair, a phenomenon which could appear 
within a context, without inter-contextually shifting stan-
dards.  
2. “Know” as gradable and vague  
The vagueness of terms in natural languages (cf. e.g. R. 
Keefe and P. Smith (eds.) 1997 for a systematic review 
and standard papers on the topic) is manifested through 
several, interrelated features: as their admitting (i) the exis-
tence of borderline cases (i.e. the cases which are not 
clearly P nor clearly not-P), (ii) indeterminate extensions 
(i.e. fuzzy boundaries between x which are P and x which 
are not-P), (iii) sorites (i.e. paradoxical inferences from the 
premises including vague predicates).  
A correlation between the gradability (i.e. continuous as-
signability of the property degrees, with fine and possibly 
imperceptible shifts between degrees) and at least some 
manifestations of vagueness is presupposed (cf. for an 
exploration of this correlation e.g. C. Kennedy 2007). De-
spite certain tendency to treat vagueness as primitive and 
gradability as derivative (like e.g. by D. Lewis 1979), the 
aforementioned interrelated features indicate that the 
gradability is explanatory for vagueness, though perhaps 
not for all types or cases of vagueness.  
The following simplified formula for the sorites series (cf. 
R. Keefe, P. Smith 1997: 8) exhibits this explanatory corre-
lation:  
“F” lacks sharp boundaries when there is no i for which 
Fxi ˄ ¬Fxi+1. 
Or in a “descending” way, 
“F” lacks sharp boundaries when there is no i for which 
Fxi ˄ ¬Fxi-1. 
Obviously, a fuzzy (vague) predicate, e.g. “bald”, is ex-
plained as a predicate which is not false for any individ-
ual’s direct successor or predecessor in a series ordered 
according to some scale for the property in question, e.g. 
bald. Consequently, the entities satisfying the property re-
ferred by the predicate, e.g. “bald”, are not clearly divided 
from those which do not satisfy it, i.e. which are not bald.  
It seems, therefore, that gradability is responsible for the 
vagueness phenomena. At least, some (or many) gradable 
predicates or singular terms, like “tall” or “tadpole”, are also 
vague, though some terms considered as vague, like “flat” 
or “empty”, are considered as not gradable (or in Ken-
nedy’s 2007 terms, as not relatively gradable). So, it is 
tempting to assume that gradability suffices for vagueness, 
and that vagueness is necessary for gradability: 
If there is no i for which Fxi ˄ ¬Fxi+1/i-1, “F” is vague 
In any case, here the focus is on the usages of “know” 
which manifest both vagueness and gradability. 
For Dretske and invariantists, the preferable linguistic 
models for “know” would not be gradable, but suitably rela-
tivized absolute predicates, like “flat” or “empty”. From a 
linguist perspective, Partee (2004) contends that “know” 
seems much more like “flat” than like “tall”. Putting Dretske’s 
view of knowledge into a “formal” mode construes “know” 
as a non-vague predicate: (i) it clearly applies to the sub-
ject’s epistemic position, depending on her conclusive rea-
sons or ability to eliminate relevant alternatives in a given 
environment, so that there are no borderline cases of 
“know”; (ii) the extension of “know” is clearly divided from 
the extension of its polar opposite “ignore”, being without 
fuzzy boundaries; consequently, (iii) “know” is not involved 
in sorites inferences. 
The problem is how to accommodate plausible invarian-
tist “intuitions”, expressed by Dretske (1981) or Stanley 
(2004), with an equally plausible idea that “know”, like so 
many other natural language terms, is gradable and 
vague.  
The linguistic marks of gradability include the use of 
comparatives (e.g. “taller”, “less tall”), equatives (e.g. “as 
tall as”) and superlatives (“the tallest”) as well as the use of 
explicit degree modifiers, like (i) “very”, (ii) “really”, or (iii) 
“well”, “better”, “best”, “very well”, (iv) “much”, “more”, 
“most” and “very much”. Obviously, not all of them can be 
applied to “know” in a natural way. Stanley (2004) tests 
whether “know” in various comparative constructions and 
together with some degree modifiers proves to be grad-
able and so context sensitive. Since it does not behave as 
naturally gradable, “know” is not context sensitive. More-
over, this fact “casts doubt upon the claim that knowledge 
comes in varying degrees of strength, a core claim of con-
textualism.” (2004: 124).  
Let us take a closer look at the use of “better” in the 
phrase “know better”. “Know better” is disqualified by 
Stanley as non-natural and inadequate, since it does not 
express a relation between a person and a proposition, i.e. 
propositional knowledge, but an “acquaintance relation”, 
analogously expressed e.g. by the German “kennen”. 
However, an acquaintance relation seems to admit grading 
concerning familiarity and directness, e.g.  
Ludwig was better acquainted with Bertrand than with 
Gottlob 
or  
Ludwig was better acquainted with Bertrand than 
Gottlob was. 
These sentences are natural paraphrases for  
Ludwig knew Bertrand better than Gottlob, 
and 
Ludwig knew Bertrand better than Gottlob did. 
Moreover, the German verb “kennen” is used not only for 
covering “to know” a person (“Arnold kennen”) or some 
other object (“die österreichische Kultur kennen”) and thus 
to be in an acquaintance relation, but also in various con-
structions of “knowing-how” (“Deutschkenntnisse”, “EDV-
Kentnnisse”, “das Schachspiel kennen“). However, this 
inter-lingual analogy seems useless in the light of intellec-
tualism, which J. Stanley and T. Williamson (2001) 
demonstrated concerning the reducibility of the knowing-
how (procedural knowledge) or knowing-who (acquaint-
ance relation) to knowing-that, i.e. propositional knowledge 
(German “Wissen”).  
Thus, constructions with “know better” do not appear as 
unnatural, as Stanley suggested. Consider his example:   
Hanna knows logic better than John does,  
means that Hanna is in a much stronger or better epis-
temic position toward logic than John, e.g. that she mas-
tered not only classical propositional logic, but is also very 
good at predicate calculus, modal and relevance logic, and 
so on. This point sounds perhaps more cogent if we evoke

57
Stanley's and Williamson’s (2001) way of paraphrasing 
such a sentence as a propositional knowledge ascription: 
Hanna knows how to draw valid logical inferences bet-
ter than John 
may be read as  
Hanna knows the ways to draw valid logical inferences 
better than John 
whereby “knows the ways” means “knows relevant proce-
dures based on the knowledge of the meanings of logical 
connectives and of logical truths (laws) taken as instruc-
tions (rules) for drawing inferences”.  
Even in an undoubtedly propositional case, “know better” 
proves natural enough: 
Newton knew better that gravitation decreases in-
versely proportional to the square of distance than 
Hook did, 
since he was able to present a mathematical proof and 
provide more adequate empirical data than Hook, though 
Hook himself came to know the law of gravitation, perhaps 
earlier than Newton. 
Also, 
Kepler knew the orbit of Mars better than Tycho, 
since Kepler discovered the underlying factual regularities, 
describable by Kepler’s laws of motion, though Tycho pos-
sessed all relevant observational data and perhaps hinted 
the elliptic form through his astronomical tables, i.e. the 
same data on which Kepler based his conclusions. 
In these cases “know”, by means of the degree modifier 
“better”, behaves obviously and naturally as gradable, and 
if our assumption is right, as vague as well.  
First, it admits borderline cases, e.g. the case of Hook, 
for whom it is, after all, not clear whether he satisfies the 
predicate “know” or is outside its extension, concerning the 
degrees of the strength of his epistemic position toward 
the law of gravitation. Secondly, it admits fuzzy boundaries 
between subjects satisfying “know” concerning the law of 
gravitation and those not satisfying it, as in a series of 
epistemic characters beginning with a top figure in the field 
comparable to Newton and ordered (in a descending way), 
so that for no i it would be true that the xi knows it and xi-1 
does not know it:  
There is no i for which Kxi ˄ ¬Kxi-1.  
Thirdly, these features open up a sorites series, in which, 
by diminishing the quality of the pertinent knowledge 
gradually, we get the following premises 
Kxi 
 
For all i, if Kxi, then Kxi-1 
from which a paradoxical consequence follows 
Kxi-n 
whereby “i-n” signifies a degree of mathematical and/or 
experimental competence insufficient for knowing the law 
of gravitation. 
This picture of “know” lacks, of course, important details. 
The grading between “know” and “ignore” is also hardly 
comparable with the grading between e.g. “hairy” and 
“bald”. Removing the pieces of evidence or elements of 
proof one by one (and sliding from an expert to an igno-
rant) is not as simple as removing hair by hair (from a hairy 
to a bald person). This difference is, however, a matter of 
degree and does not affect structural similarities.  
3. “Know” as intra-contextually vague 
Contrary to the invariantist criticism of contextualist reading 
of “know” as gradable and, therefore, as context sensitive, 
it may be argued that, although epistemic predicates are 
gradable and vague, it does not follow that they are con-
text sensitive due to inter-contextually shifting standards. 
They may be vague within a single context and thus con-
text-insensitive, or perhaps, invariantly vague.  
As in the Newton-Hook or Kepler-Tycho cases, we may 
assume a single context in which “know” refers vaguely to 
an epistemic property, whose gradable exemplification ac-
cording to a (hypothetic) epistemic scale is expressed by 
the degree modifier “[know] better” (unfortunately, an op-
posite modifier “[know] worse” is not applicable). Similarly, 
the tallness of men and the tallness of buildings may be 
compared within a single context, by referring to SI meas-
uring units as an invariant measuring standard. Accord-
ingly, “know” as gradable behaves as an intra-contextually 
vague term: vague in a single context, which is regulated 
by the invariant standards, e.g. in the Newton-Hook case 
by the standards of classical mechanics. 
4. Conclusion 
These considerations were not intended to show that 
knowledge or other epistemic properties are, in fact, grad-
able and vague. They were to provide an undermining de-
feater for the linguistic evidence used by contextualists as 
well as by their opponents. After all, knowledge may be 
gradual and vague or “relatively absolute” and non-vague. 
This fact, however, does not have to be reliably indicated 
by the behavior and semantic properties of “know”: the 
truth about knowledge lies much deeper than the truth 
about “know”.

Objects, facts and pictures – Sellars on Wittgenstein's picture 
theory 
Stefanie Dach 
Pilsen, Czech Republic | steffi.dach@centrum.cz  
Abstract 
My paper is concerned with Wilfrid Sellars' reading of Wittgenstein's Tractatus and its picture theory. I defend the view that al-
though Sellars' interpretation has some serious drawbacks, it is unique and stimulating. In the first part, I outline the main fea-
tures of his naturalist reading of the picture theory. I show that Sellars' reading cannot claim to be an overall consistent interpre-
tation and that it would force us to discard central Tractarian doctrines. Given that consistency is not the only virtue of an inter-
pretation, I proceed to analyze the advantages of Sellars' approach. It allows us to treat objects and facts in a fairly unproblem-
atic way while retaining core elements of the picture theory. Therefore, I advocate Sellars' approach as worth considering de-
spite its inability to render the Tractatus consistent. 
 
 
Wilfrid Sellars, one of the main representatives of 20
th cen-
tury analytical philosophy, belongs to the small group of 
philosophers positively disposed both towards Wittgen-
stein's later and early thought. Sellars characterizes Witt-
genstein's Tractatus logico-philosophicus as a “jewel box 
of insights” (Sellars 1962b, 47). His approval of some Trac-
tarian doctrines, and of the picture theory in particular, 
seems sometimes to be underrated in the secondary litera-
ture. This is unfortunate not only for the study of Sellars' 
thought itself but also for the study of Wittgenstein's early 
work. In my paper, I want to defend the view that although 
Sellars' interpretation cannot count as a consistent read-
ing, it offers a unique and stimulating approach to the 
Tractatus.  
1. The main characteristics of Sellars' ap-
proach 
Sellars' reading of the picture theory is characterized by 
three main features: nominalism, the repudiation of facts, 
and causal projection. In this section, I will introduce these 
features as well as discuss to what extent they are contro-
versial and how much support can be found for them in the 
primary texts. 
Sellars' reading of the picture theory might be called 
“naturalist”. Like every naturalist stance, it takes on a num-
ber of basic commitments, which prove, however, contro-
versial with respect to Wittgenstein's early writings. The 
first is nominalism: according to Sellars we should under-
stand Wittgenstein's objects only as concrete particulars; 
relations or properties are not objects (Sellars 1962a, 9). 
One of his touchstones is TLP 3.1432: 
Instead of, ‘The complex sign “aRb” says that a stands 
to b in the relation R’ we ought to put, ‘That “a” stands 
to “b” in a certain relation says that aRb.’ 
Sellars takes this to say that relation words do not repre-
sent objects of any kind, they are just a special way of ar-
ranging expressions that properly represent objects, i.e., 
singular terms. This task of arranging singular terms could 
be achieved by other means, e.g., by putting them into cer-
tain spatial relations (writing one on top of the other, etc.). 
According to Sellars, relation words, as well as adjectives, 
are in this sense superfluous and the question if they rep-
resent objects should not even arise. 
The question whether to read Wittgenstein's talk of ob-
jects in a nominalist or realist way is contested among 
commentators (for a realist reading see for example 
McGinn 2009, for a nominalist one, at least with respect to 
relations see Ricketts 1996, for a conciliatory approach 
see Pears 1987), and Wittgenstein himself is not very clear 
on this issue, either (see for example TLP 4.24; NL, 192 
and TLP 2.0231, NB, 16.6.15 respectively).  
Neither is he clear on a second problem, i.e., whether 
picturing is done by objects or by facts. We find varying 
answers to this question in the Tractatus (see TLP 2.141; 
NL, 193; NB, 30.5.15 and TLP 2.13 respectively). Similarly, 
most commentators, even the non-metaphysically ori-
ented, do not explicitly reject facts as ingredients in the 
picture theory (see for example Pears 1987, 135; McGuin-
ness 2002, 68; Stenius 1981, 118). Sellars, however, re-
fuses to accept facts as components of the picture theory. 
We can regard this as the second characteristic trait of his 
approach. In his view, it is objects that are pictured, not 
facts. Similarly, it is objects, i.e., linguistic items taken as 
natural objects in the causal net of the world, that do the 
picturing. According to him, if we say in more than an eve-
ryday, carefree way of speech that we picture facts, or that 
pictures are facts, we blur a basic distinction between facts 
and objects and head towards confusion (Sellars 1962b, 
44). Sellars places facts exclusively into the linguistic or-
der, an attitude that he shares with some non-
metaphysical readers of the Tractatus (see McGinn 2009). 
But his simultaneous insistence that language actually 
does picture but that it does not picture facts makes his 
approach unique, even if not strongly supported by the 
textual evidence.    
The last salient feature of Sellars' approach concerns the 
mode of projection. In accord with his naturalizing ap-
proach to Wittgenstein's picture theory, he takes projection 
to be causal projection. This is clearly an innovation – or 
perhaps an unwarranted intrusion – because there is no 
hint in Wittgenstein's early writings that projection must be 
causal. On the contrary, when Wittgenstein speaks of pro-
jection he treats it as a special case of translation con-
ducted according to rules (see for example TLP 4.0141).   
As we can see, there is no agreement on any of the cen-
tral claims of Sellars' reading in the secondary literature. 
Neither do we find strong textual evidence to confirm these 
claims in Wittgenstein's texts (although several supporting 
instances could be mentioned, e.g., TLP 3.1431; TLP 4.24; 
NL, 195). We may thus ask if Sellars' reading of the picture 
theory  is tenable as the core of an interpretation of the 
Tractatus.

There is a number of virtues we might want to attribute to 
a good interpretation. One of these is surely the consis-
tency our reading can show the interpreted work to have. If 
we measure Sellars' reading by this criterion, it cannot be 
defended. I have already cited some instances from Witt-
genstein's early texts that seem to contradict it. These, 
however, are not the only reasons for claiming that his 
reading cannot render the Tractatus consistent, not even 
within the obvious limits this text imposes on any such at-
tempt. Besides the lack of support in the Tractatus itself, 
Sellars' interpretation would force us to sacrifice one of the 
Tractarian core doctrines: the connection between pictur-
ing and the sense of propositions. According to Wittgen-
stein, a proposition having sense means that it is capable 
of being true or false (NL, 196). We cannot account for this 
capacity merely on the basis of a causal relation of projec-
tion. While it might appear possible to explain the truth of a 
proposition in merely causal terms, in the case of falsity 
the road seems blocked. In accepting Sellars' reading, we 
would have to give up Wittgenstein's criterion of sense and 
thus eliminate one of the central elements of the Tractatus.  
2. The assets of the Sellarsian reading 
Mostly however, Sellars does not try to establish nor even 
claim that his reading would be acceptable as a consistent 
interpretation (for an exception see Sellars 1962b). His 
strategy is to emphasize, in accordance with the jewel box 
metaphor from above, what he regards as Wittgenstein's 
positive insights and to explain on this basis why the rest 
of his doctrines is confused. Let us, therefore, disregard 
the lack of overall consistency for a moment and concen-
trate on the advantages of Sellars' approach.  
Generally, Sellars' interpretation helps to clear up a 
number of cloudy questions in the Tractatus and may offer 
a way of combining some of the advantages of metaphysi-
cal and non-metaphysical approaches to this work. First, it 
allows us to accommodate Wittgenstein's objects in a 
commonsensical way. The view that Wittgenstein's talk 
about objects is to be taken at face-value is often linked to 
metaphysical readings of the Tractatus. This needn't be 
the case for Sellars, because disconnecting picturing and 
the quest for definite sense permits us to discard the tran-
scendental aura of Wittgenstein's objects. The demand for 
perfectly definite sense based on picturing leads to a 
search for ultimately rigid, simple entities that lie beyond 
what we can explicitly grasp in propositions (see TLP 
3.221) and that we can get at only by a reflection on the 
predispositions of sense. Freed from this demand, how-
ever, we can treat objects as we treat objects of our every-
day world (even if, in the end, the ultimate objects need 
not be identical to those of our everyday world). In accept-
ing the Sellarsian position, we can read Wittgenstein's talk 
of objects in a straight-forward manner and do not need to 
search the Tractatus for hidden interpretational layers, 
which is surely an advantage of metaphysical approaches. 
At the same time, however, we would not be forced to 
push object-talk into the metaphysical realm. 
As a second advantage, Sellars' clear distinction be-
tween objects and facts leaves room for a rather uncompli-
cated treatment of the latter. Considering facts as an in-
gredient in the picture theory can lead into difficulties if we 
want to elucidate their “ontological status”. Taken seri-
ously, the Tractatus demands of facts that, as pictured en-
tities, they be somehow “in the world” independently from 
language, but also that they share structure with linguistic 
items. There seem to be two obvious ways to circumvent 
problems possibly caused by this dual character of facts. 
We could say that the logical structure shown by our sen-
tences is already present in the world itself, and is pro-
jected into sentences with sense. Facts would thus be enti-
ties in the world (I leave open the question if such a view 
forces us to reify facts). This is the road taken by many 
metaphysical readers of the Tractatus. It has the drawback 
that it is not clear on what grounds we can claim such a 
thing at all, given that the only thing we can really cogni-
tively get at is what is said in our propositions and that the 
logical form of the world can be grasped only by a sort of 
ineffable magical intuition – by grasping something “merely 
shown”.  
We might want to take a different road by claiming, as 
some non-metaphysical readers do, that Wittgenstein's 
facts (as well as objects) belong only into the linguistic 
realm (see for example McGinn 2009). On this basis, we 
could understand quite easily how facts and propositions 
come to share structure: the notion of a fact is bound to 
the notion of a proposition, a fact is whatever is repre-
sented by true propositions. The problem of the ontological 
status of facts can be elegantly deflated in this manner, 
because this approach eliminates the urge to reify facts as 
well as the troublesome question how it is possible for 
these strange entities to be “in the world”. Nevertheless, 
this move has its price. It can hardly be undertaken without 
robbing the picture theory of most of its content or commit-
ting oneself to a form of linguistic idealism. Attempts to 
understand what it means for a proposition as a linguistic 
entity to picture a fact as a linguistic entity would probably 
end up with a form of deflationism. This is no flaw in itself, 
but on this account it is quite unclear why the picture the-
ory should have such a prominent position in Wittgen-
stein's Tractatus, given that in its deflated form it cannot do 
much explanatory work. If we take the opposite road and 
claim that facts, despite their being linguistic items, literally 
constitute the world and get pictured in language, we run 
into a sort of linguistic idealism. It seems, therefore, that in 
contrast to metaphysical readings, anti-metaphysical inter-
pretations cannot save a core element of the Tractatus – 
the picture theory – in any substantial sense. 
Sellars' approach, however, may enable us to save the 
advantages of both the metaphysical and the anti-
metaphysical readings in this respect. His clear distinction 
between objects as worldly (pictured and picturing) entities 
and facts as belonging only into the linguistic order allows 
us to deflate the problem of the ontological status of facts 
while at the same time retaining a variant of the picture 
theory. In contrast to many non-metaphysical interpreta-
tions, Sellars can uphold a central Tractarian doctrine: that 
picturing provides a way of delineating a class of special 
propositions – empirical ones (Wittgenstein's propositions 
with sense). At the same time, it does not force the Trac-
tatus into serious metaphysical claims.   
Understood in this manner, Sellars' interpretation offers 
an interesting way of rehabilitating the Tractatus. Like anti-
metaphysical readings and their deflationary attitude to-
wards many of the troubling features of the Tractatus, it 
helps to highlight possible lines of continuity between Witt-
genstein's earlier and later work. But in contrast to them, 
Sellars' reading emphasizes what he sees as substantial 
positive Tractarian insights lying underneath those prob-
lematic parts. He deliberately disregards the question if the 
Tractatus can be rendered consistent, and is therefore not 
forced to choose between a metaphysical approach com-
mitting Wittgenstein to unwarranted metaphysical claims 
and a non-metaphysical approach understanding Wittgen-
stein's sentences as a specific kind of nonsense. This al-
lows him to appreciate the Tractatus in an imaginative way 
– albeit a piecemeal one.

3. Conclusion 
We have seen that Sellars offers a highly original and fruit-
ful reading of Wittgenstein's picture theory. It enables him 
to join attractive aspects of metaphysical interpretations of 
the Tractatus on the one hand (they are more straight-
forward) and non-metaphysical interpretations on the other 
(they highlight the continuity of Wittgenstein's thought). 
Still, we might attain such a reading only by giving up the 
overall consistency of the Tractatus. In the light of the fact, 
however, that we do not have any interpretation which 
succeeds in rendering the Tractatus perfectly consistent in 
an unproblematic way, Sellars' more selective attitude 
seems worth considering.

Wittgenstein and the (Im)Possibility of Moral Advice 
Benjamin De Mesel 
Liedekerke, Belgium | benjamin.demesel@hiw.kuleuven.be  
Abstract 
Moral philosophy has traditionally aimed for correct or appropriate moral judgments. Consequently, when asked for moral 
advice, the moral philosopher first tries to develop a moral judgment and then informs the advisee. The focus is on what the 
advisee should do, not on whether any advice should be given. There may, however, be various kinds of reasons not to morally 
judge, to be ‘morally modest’. I argue that Wittgenstein’s philosophy makes a case for the necessity of moral modesty, even to 
such an extent that the possibility of giving moral advice is threatened. The threat is due to the traditional link between moral 
advice and moral judgment. I argue that a Wittgensteinian notion of moral advice, in which moral advice does not have to be 
understood as linked to moral judgment, is compatible with the necessity of moral modesty. It has, therefore, a clear advantage 
over traditional notions. 
 
 
Suppose that someone struggles with a moral problem. I 
take an example from Rush Rhees (1965: 22). Alex has 
come to the conclusion that he must either leave his wife 
or abandon his work of cancer research. He asks Sarah for 
advice. What should she do? A simple answer is: she 
should work out a moral judgment and communicate it to 
him, that is, tell him what he should do or what would be 
right for him to do. She has to explain how she came to 
that judgment, what her reasons are for thinking that he 
should do this or that. But are things as simple as that? 
There seem to be situations, such as this one, in which it 
may be better not to judge, to be what I will call ‘morally 
modest’. First, I will give some reasons not to morally 
judge, to be morally modest when moral advice is asked 
for. Second, I will argue that Wittgenstein radicalizes these 
reasons to such an extent that the very possibility of moral 
advice is threatened. Third, I will argue that the need for 
moral modesty does not make moral advice impossible, 
but asks for a notion of moral advice in which moral advice 
is not necessarily linked to the ideal of a moral judgment. 
Which reasons could Sarah have not to judge? First, she 
may feel that she lacks factual knowledge about Alex and 
his situation. She does not know how the relationship with 
his wife is, whether he has children, why he thinks that his 
work is so important. Maybe Alex thinks that he will save 
many lives if he continues his work, and so on. As long as 
Sarah does not know these things, she may think it rea-
sonable not to judge. But even if she has this knowledge, 
she may not be able to work out a moral judgment. She 
may think that she just does not know what Alex should 
do, that she lacks moral competence in this case. 
The two reasons I have mentioned have something in 
common: Sarah does not judge because she cannot come 
to a good moral judgment, because she doubts the value 
of her judgment. However, even if she thinks that her 
judgment is good or correct, there may be reasons to with-
hold it. What is central here is not the value of the judg-
ment, but the moral value of the advisee. Out of what can 
roughly be called respect for Alex’s dignity and moral 
autonomy, it may be better not to judge. Suppose, for ex-
ample, that Sarah knows Alex quite well. They are friends, 
and whenever Alex has a practical problem, he asks Sarah 
for advice, and whenever she gives it, he does exactly 
what she says, he immediately acts upon her advice. Here 
Sarah may think that, in this very difficult case, she should 
not decide for him. Out of respect for his moral autonomy, 
she may think that he has to decide for himself here, and 
that she has no right to tell him what to do. 
These three reasons not to morally judge are all present 
in Wittgenstein’s work on ethics. The first reason is a lack 
of factual knowledge, and Wittgenstein refers to it in a 
conversation with Rhees. He suggests that we cannot 
judge whether Brutus’s murdering Caesar was a noble 
deed, because we lack knowledge of the situation: we do 
not know, for example, what went on in Brutus’s mind be-
fore he decided to kill Caesar (Rhees 1965: 22). But even 
if we have all this knowledge, we may still lack moral 
knowledge, we may be unable to come to a good moral 
judgment. Wittgenstein comments on our case of the man 
who does not know whether to leave his wife or to aban-
don his research, that ‘Here we may say that we have all 
the materials of a tragedy; and we could only say: ‘Well, 
God help you’’ (Rhees 1965: 22-23). ‘Well, God help you’ 
is not a moral judgment, but it is everything we can say. 
Here, Wittgenstein points at the fact that, in certain situa-
tions, it is better not to judge because we cannot come to a 
good moral judgment. 
Our third reason not to judge was respect for Alex’s 
moral autonomy. In a conversation with members of the 
Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein says: ‘At the end of my lecture 
on ethics, I spoke in the first person. I believe that is quite 
essential. Here nothing more can be established, I can 
only appear as a person speaking for myself’ (Waismann 
1965: 16). The need to speak for myself in ethics points at 
the impossibility of speaking for others. In moral matters, 
speaking for himself is a moral duty Alex cannot escape 
and Sarah cannot release him from. To do so might be to 
suggest that she sees him as someone who is not able to 
speak for himself. To ask Alex to speak for himself may be 
a sign of respect for his dignity and moral autonomy. 
The fact that the three reasons not to morally judge are 
conspicuously present in Wittgenstein’s work suggests that 
he is very sensitive to the need for moral modesty. Maybe 
even too sensitive. If ample factual knowledge is needed, if 
it is often impossible to come to a good judgment, and if 
one can only speak for oneself in moral matters, then 
moral modesty seems not just desirable in some circum-
stances, but required in all cases in which moral advice is 
asked for. We seem to be facing the paradoxical moral 
advice that we should not give moral advice because we 
can only speak for ourselves in ethics. Is that what Witt-
genstein meant when he said that we must be silent 
whereof we cannot speak? In the Tractatus, he writes that 
‘men to whom after long doubting the sense of life became 
clear, could not then say wherein this sense consisted’ 
(1981: 6.521). Do these remarks not show that, in a Witt-

Wittgenstein and the (Im)Possibility of Moral Advice | Benjamin De Mesel 
 
 
 62
gensteinian framework, the very possibility of moral advice 
is threatened? 
I do not think so. Rather, his remarks point at the need 
for a notion of moral advice which takes the need for moral 
modesty into account. We have assumed, so far, that 
Alex’s question for moral advice was at the same time a 
question for a moral judgment. That assumption is present 
in how moral philosophers would typically deal with our 
case. Traditionally, the task of the moral philosopher is to 
work out a correct or appropriate moral judgment. What 
happens in the case of Alex’s asking for moral advice can 
then be described as a three step process. First, Alex asks 
for moral advice. Second, the advisor works out a moral 
judgment. Third, the advisor tells Alex what her judgment 
is, unless there are reasons to be morally modest. We 
have seen that Wittgenstein takes these reasons so seri-
ously that he does not leave room to morally judge, if that 
means to tell Alex what he should do or what would be 
right for him to do. Consequently, we can only save the 
possibility of moral advice if we allow for the possibility that 
a question for moral advice does not necessarily ask for 
moral judgment. But can we understand a question for 
moral advice as a question which does not ask for a moral 
judgment?  
To answer that question, let us go back to our example. 
Alex asks Sarah whether he should leave his wife or 
abandon his research. Suppose that she lacks no knowl-
edge and that she does not doubt the correctness of her 
judgment. Could she then immediately answer his ques-
tion and say: ‘You should definitely leave your wife, and 
this and this are the reasons.’ That would be a moral 
judgment, but we all understand that Alex probably will not 
like such an answer, even if he has no reason to distrust 
its correctness, because such an answer ignores his dig-
nity: he has probably been thinking about the question for 
quite some time, and now Sarah comes to the unequivocal 
conclusion that he should leave his wife. He will think that 
things are not so easy, that probably she has not properly 
understood what he has asked her. ‘You should leave your 
wife’ may not be a good answer, even if it is correct, and 
this allows us to doubt whether a question for moral advice 
is indeed a question for moral judgment. 
The question now is: what could an alternative notion of 
moral advice look like? Matthew Pianalto suggests the fol-
lowing:  
What we are looking for is a description of the other 
person’s perspective on the situation. This description 
might include other evaluative claims, as well as a de-
scription of what this person takes to be the relevant 
features (i.e. facts) of the situation. We want to know 
what world this person is living in. (2011: 260) 
Taking this into account, we could say that what Alex asks 
for is not Sarah’s telling him what to do, but her showing 
him a moral world or a moral perspective. Alex’s question 
is not a question for judgment, but a question to show him 
alternative ways of thinking about his problem: he does not 
so much want to hear from Sarah what he should do, he 
wants to know how she sees it. And here she can speak 
for herself: she may not feel able to say what Alex should 
do, but she can try to give insight in her ways of dealing 
with things. Alex’s question is not a question asking for an 
answer in which Sarah says what he has to do, but a 
question inviting her to show possibilities of dealing with 
his situation, possibilities he may not have seen. Cora 
Diamond suggests that she may try to redescribe his situa-
tion so that maybe he will no longer think that it has to be 
put in terms of a dilemma (2002).  
To show a moral perspective is not only to show alterna-
tive possibilities, it is also to confront Alex with his own 
ways of moral thinking. Wittgenstein writes: ‘I must be 
nothing more than the mirror in which my reader sees his 
own thinking with all its deformities & with this assistance 
can set it in order’ (1998: 25). To frame Alex’s problem in 
the mirror of another moral world allows him to compare it 
to problems he had not previously seen as similar and to 
see new contrasts. It gives his problem a new background 
and a new surrounding, and that is, according to Wittgen-
stein, exactly how we should deal with philosophical prob-
lems in general. In the mirror of Sarah’s moral thinking, he 
is allowed to see his thinking anew, from a distance which 
makes fuller understanding possible. Someone who looks 
in a mirror is sometimes struck by what he sees, like 
someone who hears his voice on the radio or sees photo-
graphs of himself. Sarah’s moral thinking does not function 
as a model to which Johnny has to adapt his moral think-
ing, but, to use Wittgenstein’s term, as an object of com-
parison, a yardstick he can use to compare his way of 
dealing with the problem and his moral perspective with 
hers (2009: § 131). 
If we think of moral advice as not necessarily tied to 
moral judgment, then the ideal answer to a question for 
moral advice must not be thought of as Sarah’s saying 
what Alex should do, but rather as her clarifying his situa-
tion. In this way, she can of course still help him to find out 
what he should do, but this way of helping him avoids, in 
Wittgenstein’s words, ‘the dogmatism into which we fall so 
easily in doing philosophy’ (2009: § 131), which is in this 
case to be understood as the dogmatic bluntness of a di-
rect moral judgment.   
I have not wanted to say that a question for moral advice 
is never a question for a moral judgment, only that moral 
advice does not necessarily go together with the ideal of a 
judgment. Hence, the failure to come up with a moral 
judgment when asked for moral advice does not necessar-
ily amount to a failure to adequately answer the question. 
Wittgenstein’s answer ‘Well, God help you’, or an answer 
such as ‘I’m terribly sorry, but I really don’t know what you 
should do’ may well be more adequate or appropriate in 
Alex’s case than a judgment. Alex’s question can be an-
swered by supporting and consoling him, by redescribing 
his case, asking questions, comparing it to similar cases, 
and so on, without ever morally judging him. Sarah might, 
for example, answer his question by telling him how she 
dealt with her parents’ divorce, how she felt and what she 
did, thus guiding Alex through parts of her moral world. 
Such an answer could show that she recognizes the diffi-
culty, the importance, the depth of his problem, the fact 
that it is to be carefully dealt with, that she takes it seri-
ously and, at the same time, that she recognizes his 
autonomy and his need to speak for himself in moral mat-
ters. Such an answer should not be understood as a fail-
ure because there is no moral judgment in it. But as long 
as moral philosophers see it as their ideal to produce 
moral judgments when confronted with Alex’s question, 
many adequate answers will appear as failures from their 
perspective, whereas answers Alex clearly is not looking 
for, such as ‘You should definitely leave your wife’, will 
seem, from that perspective, more acceptable than they 
actually are.

Methods of Demystification: Wittgenstein vs. Marx 
Janice Deary 
St. Andrews, Scotland | jld4@st-andrews.ac.uk 
Abstract 
In this paper I claim that there is an significant metaphilosophical similarity between Wittgenstein and Marx, both of whom were 
interested in liberating us from our tendency to be ‘mystified’ by the products of our own confusion. Despite this similarity, Witt-
genstein and Marx proffer very different methods to achieve demystification: for the former, demystification is attained through 
logical or linguistic analysis, whereas for the latter, mystification can only be overcome if we change the “form of life” that con-
tributes to its production and persistence. Using Wittgenstein and Marx as a basis, I argue that the problem of mystification, and 
how it is best resolved, is a fundamental question for metaphilosophy. 
 
 
“Let us liberate them from the chimeras, the 
ideas, dogmas, imaginary beings under the yoke 
of which they are pining away.”  (Karl Marx)

word, that is, the word that finally permits us to

1. Introduction 
In this paper I claim that there is a significant metaphiloso-
phical similarity between Wittgenstein and Marx, both of 
whom were interested in liberating us from our tendency to 
be ‘mystified’ by the products of our own confusion. De-
spite this similarity, Wittgenstein and Marx proffer very dif-
ferent methods to achieve this demystification: for the for-
mer, demystification is attained through logical or linguistic 
analysis, whereas for the latter, mystification can only be 
overcome if we change the “form of life” that contributes to 
its production and persistence.  
This phenomenon of mystification might have been ex-
plored in relation to a number of other philosophers or 
schools of thought (including Critical Theory, or even psy-
choanalysis), but it seems Marx offers an interesting chal-
lenge to Wittgenstein, in his belief that philosophical analy-
sis alone is not enough to free us of the confusion and 
self-deception that results in suffering. We will start with 
Marx and his predecessor Feuerbach, before turning to 
Wittgenstein and a discussion of the metaphilosophical 
implications of their respective methods of demystification. 
2.1. Marx and the Feuerbach Inspiration 
In order to understand Marx’s critique of mystification, we 
need to take a brief detour by way of his predecessor, 
Feuerbach. In The Essence of Christianity, Feuerbach of-
fers a brilliantly original, proto-psychoanalytical account of 
how the symbols of religion – Christ, the Trinity, the Holy 
Family, Communion – are imbued with a sense of sacred 
power and mystery, because we have ‘forgotten’ that 
these are really the projected secrets of our own actual 
existence. That is, these are real things or experiences – 
true objects of value – that have been ‘mystified’ due to 
our ignorance: “Religion is the dream of the human mind. 
But even in dreams we do not find ourselves in emptiness 
or in heaven, but on earth, in the realm of reality; we only 
                                                      
1 “The German Ideology,” in Marx/Engels (1975), Vol. 5, p. 23. 
2 Wittgenstein (1993), p. 165 
see real things in the entrancing splendour of imagination 
and caprice, instead of in the simple daylight of reality and 
necessity.”
3  
According to Feuerbach, then, we have inadvertently be-
come alienated from ourselves by projecting the mysteries 
of our own being onto religious figures and concepts. The 
“mystery of religion,” says Feuerbach, is that man “objecti-
fies his being and then again makes himself an object to 
the objectivized image of himself thus converted into a 
subject.”
4 We are enslaved or bewitched by these mysteri-
ous objects, which we fail to recognize as our own projec-
tions: man fails to see that the “power of the object over 
him is therefore the power of his own being.”
5  
For Feuerbach, the result of mystification is suffering. 
The self-alienation at the heart of religious mystification 
prevents the human being from appreciating his own natu-
ral gifts and powers, as well as his own fragility and sensi-
tivity: “By promising man eternal life, [religion] deprived him 
of temporal life, by teaching him to trust in God’s help it 
took away his trust in his own powers; by giving him faith in 
a better life in heaven, it destroyed his faith in a better life 
on earth and his striving to attain such a life.”
6 Feuerbach 
was thus as critical of philosophical metaphysics as he 
was of religion: instead of perpetuating our self-deception, 
by fostering belief in the existence of reified concepts, phi-
losophy should be a process of demystification: exposing 
and eradicating falsity and illusion. “Absolute Philosophy,” 
says Feuerbach, “externalises and alienates from man his 
own being and his own activity,” a process which has the 
negative effect of inflicting “violence and torture… on our 
minds.”
7 
In an arguably similar way to the later Wittgenstein, 
Feuerbach sees philosophy as performing the role of both 
diagnosis and cure: both an exposure of mystification, and 
a method of demystification. For Marx, on the other hand, 
philosophical analysis can only ever offer a diagnosis, and 
not a cure, as he sees mystification as a ‘practical’, and not 
a purely ‘theoretical’ problem: the “solution of theoretical 
riddles,” says Marx, “is the task of practice and effected 
through practice.”

2.2. Marx and the Limits of Theoretical De-
mystification  
Marx sees mystification, not as mere intellectual confusion, 
but as the expression of a deeply alienated social order, 
which means that this mystification can only be overcome 
through socio-economic revolution. In The German Ideol-
ogy, Marx quips that the idea that philosophy alone can 
solve ‘practical’ problems is like someone thinking that he 
will not drown if he does not believe in gravity: “If they were 
to knock this notion out of their heads, say by stating it to 
be a superstition, a religious concept, they would be sub-
limely proof against any danger from water.”
9  
For Marx, then, mystification is not merely ‘conceptual’: 
capitalist society as a whole is a mystified phenomenon, 
and both capitalist and worker have allowed themselves to 
be deceived by the system. In giving up his time and la-
bour, for instance, the worker is alienated from himself and 
others: “Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the 
human imagination, the human brain, and the human 
heart, detaches itself from the individual and reappears as 
the alien activity of a god or of a devil, so the activity of the 
worker is not his own spontaneous activity. It belongs to 
another, it is a loss of his self.”
10 The capitalist, on the 
other hand, is bewitched by commodities and profit, pro-
jecting the true value of human creativity and relationships 
onto these external objects: “There is a definite social rela-
tion between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantas-
tic form of a relation between things.”
11 Through the 
worker’s alienation, and the fetishization of commodities, 
“we have the complete mystification of the capitalist mode 
of production,” and the production of an “enchanted, per-
verted, topsy-turvy world.”
12  
Nobody ‘wins’ in this “topsy-turvy world”: the result for 
both worker and capitalist is suffering, even if this is un-
evenly distributed: “in those cases where worker and capi-
talist equally suffer, the worker suffers in his very exis-
tence, the capitalist in the profit on his dead mammon.”
13 
Marx is therefore surprisingly sympathetic to religion, 
which he sees, not as the cause of suffering, but an at-
tempt to relieve it: “Religious suffering is, at one and the 
same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest 
against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed 
creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of 
soulless conditions.”
14 The abolition of religion as the illu-
sory happiness of the people, says Marx, “is the demand 
for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their 
illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a 
condition that requires illusions.”
15 
For Marx, then, the philosopher can reveal something 
that has hitherto been concealed, but once this truth has 
been exposed, we should be propelled into action. The 
philosopher can make us conscious of our deception, but 
this demystification should necessarily lead to a desire to 
change the conditions that have caused or perpetuated 
this mystification. Marx would therefore have been as criti-
cal of Wittgenstein as he was of Feuerbach, who “[did] not 
grasp the significance of ‘revolutionary,’ of ‘practical-
critical,’ activity,” or the fact that “all mysteries which lead

3. Bewitched by Language: Wittgenstein vs. 
Disguised Nonsense17 
While there are many differences between Wittgenstein 
and Marx, I do not think it is too far-fetched to say that 
there is some metaphilosophical compatibility in their ef-
forts to tackle mystification, although their difference ap-
proaches to (and conceptions of) mystification raise some 
important questions for metaphilosophy in general. That is, 
whereas Marx saw mystification as a socio-economic prob-
lem, for Wittgenstein, mystification is a conceptual prob-
lem: a result of our being “tricked by grammar,” or “be-
witched by language.” The task of philosophy, for Wittgen-
stein, is to point out when and how we have been tempted 
to use words in an illogical way.  
Wittgenstein’s goal is logical clarity, which can only be 
achieved negatively, through an exposure of nonsense. 
Wittgenstein expresses this goal differently in his earlier 
and later work. In the Tractatus, he sees philosophy in 
general as a misguided attempt to search for something 
we already know, but which can never be said, as it is the 
condition saying anything at all. That is, the logico-
metaphysical form of reality, the Holy Grail of the philoso-
pher, is already displayed in the logic of our language. As 
Wittgenstein says, “all the propositions of our everyday 
language, just as they stand, are in perfect logical order. 
—That utterly simple thing, which we have to formulate 
here, is not a likeness of the truth, but the truth itself in its 
entirety.”18 Given that the ‘truth’ has been under our noses 
all along, this means that most of the “questions of phi-
losophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of 
our language,” and that “the deepest problems are in fact 
not problems at all.”
19 
Yet while Wittgenstein claims in the Tractatus that, “the 
problems have in essential been finally solved,” he also 
acknowledges, “how little has been done when these prob-
lems have been solved,” and perhaps this leads to a more 
significant question regarding Wittgenstein’s metaphiloso-
phical assumptions at this point, which is whether philoso-
phers are really seeking to know the metaphysico-logical 
structure of reality, or whether they are seeking, as many 
saints and sages have claimed throughout human history, 
a way of avoiding or dealing with suffering.  
Which is not to say that Wittgenstein is unconcerned with 
suffering. Perhaps intellectual or conceptual confusion is at 
the heart of the sense of alienation that seems to charac-
terize the human condition. While Wittgenstein might not 
offer us any metaphysical theories or doctrines, it seems 
that liberation from confusion might also involve liberation 
from suffering, insofar as we “grasp what up to now has 
intangibly weighed down upon our consciousness.”
20 Dis-
solving a philosophical problem can free us from the 
shackles of ignorance: “Philosophical problems can be 
compared to locks on safes,” says Wittgenstein, “which 
can be opened by dialling a certain word or number, so 
that no force can open the door until just this word has 
been hit upon, and once it is hit upon any child can open 
it.”

16 “Theses on Feuerbach,” (I & VIII), in Marx/Engels (1975), Vol. 1, pp. 13-15. 
17 Wittgenstein claims in the Philosophical Investigations (1953) that his “aim 
is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to something that 
is patent nonsense.” (§ 464)

In his later work, Wittgenstein no longer sees philosophy 
as a metaphysical enquiry but “a grammatical one,” which 
“sheds light on our problem by clearing misunderstandings 
away.”
22 Wittgenstein admits that in his earlier thought he 
was seduced by “the illusion that what is sublime, what is 
essential, about our investigation consists in grasping one 
comprehensive essence.”
23 We find ourselves pursuing the 
“chimera” of a metaphysical essence as “as something that 
lies beneath the surface,”
24 because of the “enormous im-
portance attaching to it… together with a misunderstand-
ing of the logic of language.”
25 This sort of metaphysical 
picture is like a superstition that we find very difficult to no-
tice, let alone eradicate: “A picture held us captive. And we 
could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and lan-
guage seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.”
26  
In the Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein reveals 
how we become “tricked” by grammar, when we misuse 
words and betray their ordinary logic. We learn how to 
speak grammatically or logically, according to normative 
criteria, and when we get it wrong, this can result in non-
sense or absurdity. Like Feuerbach, Wittgenstein was well 
aware of how philosophers are sometimes more guilty of 
producing confusion than dissolving it. In fact, the tempta-
tion to abstract and reify concepts seems an occupational 
hazard: the moment a philosopher asks of an abstract 
concept, “what is x?” they are inclined to treat the concept 
as a special kind of object, rather than a word that is more 
or less intelligently used in ordinary discourse. Trying to 
understand the meaning of a concept, through any means 
other than looking at how the concept is used, we are 
sometimes duped by a “grammatical illusion”
27 – a belief 
that an abstract concept is an actual entity. This is not only 
a logical – but also an onto-logical error. Philosophers 
throughout the history of the tradition have been prone to 
thinking that, if a concept does not refer to a physical ob-
ject, it must therefore refer to a metaphysical object. They 
then struggle to understand this object, failing to recognize 
that this ‘object’ is not a real mystery, so much as a prod-
uct of metaphysical mystification. Wittgenstein therefore 
sees philosophy as “a battle against the bewitchment of 
our intelligence by means of language.”
28  
In order to avoid nonsense, we need to “bring words 
back from their metaphysical to their everyday use,”
29 says 
Wittgenstein. It is only in returning to the way we ordinarily 
use words that we can demystify what Wittgenstein calls 
“super-concepts”: if philosophical or metaphysical terms 
such as ‘language’, ‘experience’, ‘world’, etc., have a use, 
he says, then “it must be as humble a one as that of the 
words ‘table’, ‘lamp’, ‘door’.”
30  Through his description of 
how we ordinarily use words in everyday life, Wittgenstein 
reveals how we are tempted to misuse these words, and 
produce seemingly profound philosophical statements that 
are really little more than “disguised nonsense.” But does it 
explain why we attach such “enormous importance” to cer-
tain reified concepts or metaphysical pictures?

4. Concluding Remarks: Is Description 
Enough? 
Unlike Feuerbach or Marx (or many of the Critical Theo-
rists and psychoanalysts since, who have been concerned 
with this issue), then, Wittgenstein sees mystification as a 
product of grammatical confusion. Wittgenstein’s Philoso-
phical Investigations might be considered exercises in de-
mystification: an exposure of “disguised nonsense,” in or-
der to achieve logical clarity. The philosopher’s task here is 
not to provide a metaphysical or scientific explanation, but 
to describe what is already the case, and in so doing, re-
veal where we have gone wrong: “We must do away with 
explanation, and description alone must take its place… in 
such a way as to make us recognise these workings; de-
spite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are 
solved… by arranging what we have always known.”
31  
But is description enough? Unlike Marx, Wittgenstein 
was not interested in theorizing about why we are ‘mysti-
fied’ by certain concepts or metaphysical pictures: he 
might say something along the lines of, “this is just what 
happens,” or “this is what we do.” In fact, Wittgenstein 
once described philosophy, rather unpoetically, as 
“scratching an itch.”
32 Marx would no doubt protest against 
the idea that description is enough to free us of our self-
deception and suffering, as he saw mystification operating 
on every level of our alienated “form of life”, which would 
require more than philosophical analysis to effect any 
transformation: “Wittgenstein has only described the 
world,” Marx might say: “the point is to change it!” 
Wittgenstein, on the other hand, might feel that we 
should try to change our attitude to the world, before being 
too quick to change the world itself.
33 And it seems that 
Wittgenstein would further disagree with Marx’s idea that 
we can deal with mystification once and for all, in one fell 
swoop or revolution. Our capacity to be duped or deceived 
is apparently infinite, and thus so is the demystifying task 
of philosophy, which is indefinite and painstaking: “People 
are deeply imbedded in philosophical, i.e., grammatical 
confusions. And to free them presupposes pulling them out 
of the immensely manifold connections they are caught up 
in.”
34 Whether philosophy should only be concerned with 
“grammatical confusions” is a question that cannot be ex-
plored further here. Yet it seems that the problem of mysti-
fication, and how it is best resolved, is a fundamental 
question for metaphilosophy.  
                                                      
31 Wittgenstein (1953), §109 
32 More precisely, in response to the charge that philosophy has never made 
any progress, Wittgenstein (1980) quips: “Philosophy hasn’t made any pro-
gress? — If someone scratches where it itches, do we have to see progress? 
Is it not genuine scratching otherwise, or genuine itching?” p. 98e 
33 As Wittgenstein says: “If life becomes hard to bear we think of improve-
ments. But the most important and effective improvement, in our own attitude, 
hardly occurs to us, and we can decide on this only with the utmost difficulty.”

Rigidity and Inconsistent Beliefs 
Dušan Dožudić 
Zagreb, Croatia | ddozudic@hrstud.hr 
Abstract 
In this paper I will discus William Lycan’s objection to Fregeans who grant name’s rigidity, explaining it by the appeal to rigidity 
of other expressions (descriptions or predicates). Lycan argues that proponents of such a view face the same problem of recon-
ciling the truth of particular propositional attitude reports with agent’s rationality, as anti-Fregeans, i.e. Millians do. I will analyse 
Lycan’s objection and argue that it fails to threaten such Fregeans. 
 
 
In discussing Donnellan’s referential descriptions and their 
possible assimilation into rigid descriptions, Kripke (2011: 
106) makes two remarks, which taken together motivate a 
novel Fregean analysis of proper names: 
[…] a rigid definite description […] still determines its 
referent via its unique satisfaction of the associated 
property – and this fact separates the notion of such a 
description from that of a referential description, as 
Donnellan defines it. 
My view is that proper names (except perhaps, for 
some quirky and derivative uses, that are not uses as 
names) are always rigid. […] It would be logically pos-
sible to have single words that abbreviated nonrigid 
definite descriptions, but these would not be names. 
The point is not merely terminological: I mean that such 
abbreviated nonrigid definite descriptions would differ in 
an important semantical feature from (what we call) 
typical proper names in our actual speech. 
A Fregean impressed with anti-Fregean insights about the 
functioning of proper names, who is still not willing to settle 
with some anti-Fregean view, might, inspired with Kripke’s 
remarks, reason in the following way: If the rigidity were 
the only principal semantic difference between, say, ‘Aris-
totle’ (as a genuine, rigid name), and ‘Aristotle’* (as an os-
tensible, non-rigid name that in fact abbreviates a non-rigid 
description or predicate), it appears that ‘Aristotle’* would 
be as good as a genuine name if it would be associated 
with a rigid description or predicate instead. And although 
such a name would be rigid, its reference would still be 
mediated via some uniquely descriptive content (as it is in 
the classical Fregeanism). And that descriptive content, 
rather than the referent itself, would enter into the proposi-
tional content of sentences embedding names. This would 
leave one with a Fregean view that preserves the benefits 
that the mediating descriptive content provides to classical 
Fregeans (such as the straightforward explanation of the 
cognitive value, or meaningfulness of empty names), to-
gether with the ability to embrace and explain Kripkean 
modal intuitions regarding proper names and their rigidity. 
This ‘rigidity-embracing Fregeanism’ (REF), as one might 
call it, successfully overcomes modal problems with the 
classical Fregeanism. The accompanying, primarily epis-
temological issues still remain. Nevertheless, a number of 
philosophers did, in one way or another, promote such a 
Fregean view (see e.g. Ackerman 1979, Harrison 1982, 
Jubien 1993, Justice 2001 and 2003, Lewis 1997, Nelson 
2002, Plantinga 1974 and 1978). Their particular accounts 
of course mutually significantly differ. For example, Plant-
inga argued that proper names express individual es-
sences of their referents, where individual essence is any 
property of the referent such that the referent has it essen-
tially and that no other object has it (being identical to Aris-
totle or being the actual author of Metaphysics are two 
candidates). Ackerman reduced such essential properties 
to the single one of the form being the actual entity stand-
ing in the particular complex causal relation to ‘N’. Justice 
argues that name’s meaning is always captured with the 
rigid nominal description of the form ‘the bearer of “N”’, 
whose rigidity stems from the way names are individuated 
etc. But despite all their differences, the common underly-
ing idea is that proper names have uniquely (although not 
purely) descriptive contents whose linguistic representation 
(be it a description or a predicate) rigidly single out what-
ever the name designates in the actual world. 
Now consider the following scenario: Jones is a sloppy 
history student, and as a result of his sloppiness, he forms 
the belief that Cicero was Roman and Tully was not. So in 
believing what he does, Jones (unknown to him of course) 
attributes contradictory properties to one and the same 
person; he assents to ‘Cicero was Roman’, dissents from 
‘Tully was Roman’, and in many occasions sincerely utters 
‘Cicero was Roman and Tully was not’. Consequently the 
report 
1. 
Jones believes that Cicero was Roman and 
Tully was not, 
must be true. Does it follow from (1)’s truth that Jones is 
irrational? This is a typical problematic case for anti-
Fregeans (and a supportive case for Fregeans), because 
intuitively Jones’s belief does not make him irrational, but 
anti-Fregeans prima facie lack means to explain this. In 
other words, if ‘anti-Fregean’ means being Millian, and ‘Mil-
lian’ means accepting the thesis that the sole contribution 
that proper names make to the propositional content of the 
sentences they are embedded in, is the object which 
names rigidly designate, then the following reports, 
2. 
Jones believes that Cicero was Roman and 
Cicero was not, 
3. 
Jones believes that Tully was Roman and 
Tully was not, 
4. 
Jones believes that Tully was Roman and 
Cicero was not, 
together with (1), report one and the same belief. The con-
tent of this belief will be the singular proposition consisting 
of the referent of coreferential names ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’, 
and properties being Roman and being non-Roman. As 
long as the basic linguistic conventions are obeyed, (2) 
and (3) clearly report an inconsistent belief, because the 
embedded ‘that’-clauses stand for a contradiction. So from 
the above anti-Fregean assumption it follows that (1) and 
(4) must report it too. But (2) and (3) could not be true if 
Jones were rational; (1) and (4) might be true if Jones 
were rational yet ignorant. The challenge for anti-Fregeans 

Rigidity and Inconsistent Beliefs | Dušan Dožudić

is to explain how could this be the case, if name’s referent 
is its sole contribution to the propositional content of sen-
tences it is embedded in, and if propositional attitudes 
such as belief have propositions as their contents, and in-
herit properties, such as being true, consistent, contradic-
tory etc., from them. 
The classical Fregeans easily escape this problem. For 
them proper names typically express identifying properties 
(or descriptive contents) that can be instantiated (or satis-
fied) by different individuals in different possible worlds. If 
‘Cicero’ expresses the property of being the Roman orator 
who denounced Catiline, that property singles out one in-
dividual in the actual world, and other individuals in at least 
some other possible worlds. Therefore, the sentence 
‘Cicero was Roman and Tully was not’, although false in 
the actual world because properties expressed by ‘Cicero’ 
and ‘Tully’ single out the same individual, might say some-
thing true in possible worlds in which (a) the two respective 
properties single out different individuals, and (b) the indi-
vidual named ‘Cicero’ is Roman and the individual named 
‘Tully’ is not. Now, since ‘Cicero was Roman and Tully was 
not’ expresses a possibly true proposition, any belief that 
has that proposition for its content cannot be inconsistent, 
since inconsistent beliefs must have a contradictory propo-
sition for its content, and contradictory propositions must 
be necessary false. The proposition that Cicero was Ro-
man and Tully was not is not necessary false on the pre-
sent account, so it cannot be a contradiction. 
Thus we have the classical Fregeans who have no prob-
lem with reports such as (1), and anti-Fregeans forced to 
do some additional work in order to convince one that such 
reports, even on their semantic analysis, are on the par 
with our intuitions about rationality and inconsistency of 
agents in question. What about REF? Lycan (1994) thinks 
that cases such as the one involving (1) are as problematic 
for the proponents of REF as they are for anti-Fregeans 
(i.e. Millians). Taking Plantinga (1978) as a representative 
figure, he (1994: 139-140) concludes: 
Unfortunately, Plantinga is as firmly committed to the 
contradictoriness of our friend [Jones’] belief [that 
Cicero was Roman and Tully was not] as is the Millian. 
Suppose “Cicero” and “Tully” abbreviate distinct world-
indexed descriptions, both satisfied by their common 
referent. Both descriptions are rigid; that is what world-
indexing is for. But if both descriptions are rigid, then 
[Jones’] utterance on [the occasion] is true in no possi-
ble world. It refers doubly to one and the same individ-
ual at each world and predicates contradictory proper-
ties of him. The proponent of [the Boethian compro-
mise] has just the same options vis-a-vis [Jones’] ra-
tionality as has the proponent of [the view that [Jones] 
accepts a contradiction]. In this sense, the mere rigidity 
of names is just as bad as full-scale Millianness. 
If Lycan is right here, the problem is far-reaching because, 
according to him, it stems only from combining coreference 
and rigidity in certain belief reports. This brings REF in fairly 
unpleasant situation. Not only does it not manage to avoid 
all the problems haunting the classical Fregeans – as I 
said, the epistemological issues still remain – but in em-
bracing the rigidity thesis, it inherits at least one problem 
distinctive for anti-Fregeans, which classical Fregeans 
easily solve, namely the problem emerging from the ap-
parent cognitive difference among coreferential names. 
This, if correct, would make REF a less attractive option 
from both other Fregean, as well as the anti-Fregean 
views. In what follows I will reconstruct Lycan’s objection, 
and then argue that it does not really pose a problem for 
Fregeans. I will point to a missing premise needed for his 
objection to work (but to whose truth Fregeans are not 
committed), and to false assumptions underlying his objec-
tion. If I am right, Fregeans and anti-Fregeans are not in 
the same situation with cases such as (1) after all. The 
moral will be that it takes more than coreference and rigid-
ity to reach Lycan’s supposed tension with (1). 
Lycan’s cited objections to REF can be reconstructed as 
follows: 
5. 
Let ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’ be coreferential 
names. 
6. 
Let ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’ be rigid designators. 
7. 
If (5) and (6), then every sentence that predi-
cates to Cicero (referred to as ‘Cicero’) and to 
Cicero (referred to as ‘Tully’) contradictory 
properties, being F and being non-F, must 
express a necessary falsehood – any such 
sentence as we use it can in no possible 
world express a true proposition. 
8. 
‘Cicero was Roman and Tully was not’ is one 
such sentence (because (i) the contradictory 
pair of properties being Roman and being 
non-Roman is predicated to one and the 
same individual, at the same time of course, 
and (ii) there is no possible world in which 
Cicero and Tully would be distinct individuals, 
since ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’ designate rigidly). 
9. 
Then if Jones’ belief is correctly reported us-
ing (1), Jones believes a contradiction. 
10. If Jones believes a contradiction, he has an 
inconsistent belief. 
11. If Jones has an inconsistent belief, he cannot 
be rational. 
12. So Jones is irrational. 
13. But intuitively there seems to be nothing irra-
tional about Jones’ believing that Cicero was 
Roman and Tully was not – Jones is simply a 
rational ignoramus. 
So, as Lycan’s argument demonstrates, there seems to be 
a clash of our intuitions concerning attitude reports such as 
(1), and logical consequences of the view that proper 
names are rigid designators. If he is right, any conception 
of proper names according to which they are rigid designa-
tors – and virtually all current conceptions grant their rigid-
ity – would be affected with this argument. What was typi-
cally thought to be a distinctive anti-Fregean problem, now 
becomes a general threat. 
Having straightforward semantic means to deal with 
substitution failures, and related phenomena, including the 
case with (1) above, is a distinctive characteristic of Fre-
geans. Lycan thinks that this somehow changes once Fre-
geans incorporate modalities and rigidity into their seman-
tics. I think that this is not true, and that Lycan’s criticism of 
REF fails. I will offer three objections to Lycan’s argument, 
which even separately expose his argument as deficient. 
Firstly, consider Lycan’s attribution of contradictoriness. 
According to him, REF is committed to the contradictori-
ness of Jones’ belief because the content of Jones’ belief 
is the contradiction that Cicero was Roman and Tully was 
not. But that seems to be wrong. Contradiction is stan-
dardly defined as the conjunction of a proposition and its 
negation. So if Jones believes a contradiction, the proposi-
tion he believes should be such a conjunction. But on most

Fregean accounts (including REF), this does not have to be 
the case with (1) (Plantinga’s early 1974 view is an infa-
mous exception). For Fregeans, the truth of (1) is recon-
ciled with Jones’ rationality by assuming that in his idiolect 
Jones associates different properties, or descriptive con-
tents, with names ‘Cicero’ and ‘Tully’. If so, for Jones sen-
tences ‘Cicero was Roman’ and ‘Tully was Roman’ ex-
press different propositions, say P1 and P2. But then, the 
conjunction of P1 and the negation of P2 cannot be a con-
tradiction, because P1  P2 and so believing such a con-
junctive proposition cannot be a ground for ascribing in-
consistency and irrationality to Jones. For REF, then, (1) 
does not represent Jones as irrational after all. 
Secondly, Lycan is presupposing that if something is 
necessary false, as no doubt the proposition that Cicero 
was Roman and Tully was not is for REF, it must be a con-
tradiction. He (1994: 140) writes: ‘But if names are rigid, 
then (B)[the sentence “Cicero was Roman and Tully was 
not”] is false at any possible world, and to believe what it 
expresses is to believe an explicit contradiction.” However, 
that is false. Although all contradictions are necessary 
falsehoods, all necessary falsehoods are not contradic-
tions. Assuming that they are all de facto falsehoods, 
cases such as ‘Although a human, Aristotle is not a mam-
mal’, ‘Water is not H2O’, and possibly even ‘2 + 2 = 5’ 
make the good example. Therefore, to believe something 
necessary false is not the same thing as to believe a con-
tradiction. The former does not make the agent irrational, 
but merely stubborn or ignorant, unless (perhaps) she 
knows that what she believes is impossible, what Jones 
surely does not. Thus, unless an additional argument or 
premise is provided, the mere acknowledgement that 
Jones believes something necessary false does not entail 
that he believes a contradiction. Lycan provides no such 
argument, and to introduce this ‘knows about the impossi-
bility’ premise would change the terms radically, and as 
such would be irrelevant. So again he fails to show that 
cases such as (1) are problematic for REF. 
Finally, even if my two previous objections were disre-
garded or discredited, Lycan’s argument would face the 
following problem. In order to demonstrate that Jones 
should be considered irrational from the perspective of 
REF, an additional premise would have to be added to his 
argument, namely 
14. Jones knows that Cicero is Tully (i.e. that the 
actual such and such is the actual so-and-
so). 
In other words, only the conjunction of (1) and (14), namely 
15. Jones believes that Cicero was Tully and 
Roman, and Tully was Cicero but not Roman, 
represents Jones as irrational, although what Jones be-
lieves in (15) would still not be a contradiction as previ-
ously defined. On the other hand, starting from the anti-
Fregean semantics, no such additional premise is needed, 
because there is nothing semantically informative in any 
identity statement. One should know a priori whether an 
identity statement is true solely on the ground of knowing 
the meaning of its component parts. Recall, for anti-
Fregeans, name’s referent is its only propositional compo-
nent. So if proposition is what one apprehends when one 
understands a sentence embedding a name (i.e. if no ad-
ditional explanation of understanding such a sentence is 
taken into account), for anti-Fregeans (1) straightforwardly 
represents Jones as irrational. For a typical proponent of 
REF, however, identity statements do differ in their informa-
tiveness or cognitive value, and so (14) is needed for Ly-
can’s objection to work. Without it, (1) on REF’s account 
does not represent Jones as irrational. 
Hence, all things considered, Lycan fails to provide a con-
clusive argument against the rigidity-embracing Fregean-
ism.

Wittgenstein on knowing the “what it’s like” of one’s own, and 
other’s, sensations 
Christoph Durt 
Heidelberg, Germany | christoph@durt.info  
Abstract 
At the 2014 Wittenstein-Symposium, I will not read this paper, but present electronic slides. For getting the most out of the pres-
entation, it very much makes sense to read this paper first. In it, I connect some of Wittgenstein’s arguments around the topic of 
“private language” to the nowadays popular notion of “qualia.” I argue that Wittgenstein would reject two main features “qualia” 
are alleged to exhibit. Wittgenstein’s arguments show that (1) the quality of sensations is not knowable to the subject that has 
them just by having them, and (2), that it is not true that they can it be known to that subject only. 
 
 
1. The question of the “what it’s like of” 
sensations of others 
In contemporary discussions, the debate around the qual-
ity and role of sensations is often framed under the con-
cept of “qualia.” I here will take a look at this concept from 
a Wittgensteinian perspective with respect to two features 
“qualia” are supposed to exhibit: (1), they are alleged to be 
knowable to the subject that has them just by having them, 
and (2), they are alleged to be knowable to that subject 
only. I will distinguish between them carefully, for I think 
that conflating these two features has caused confusion 
about what “qualia” are supposed to be.  
Further confusion has been caused by different defini-
tions of the extension of the concept of “qualia.” Some 
theorists hold that “qualia” pertain to perceptual experi-
ences and bodily sensations only, others also extend the 
concept to emotions and moods, and yet others think that 
thoughts as well have qualia. To avoid such confusions, I 
will here restrict my argument to (besides colors) the fore-
most paradigm case of the discussion around “qualia”: 
sensations of pain.  
I think that the notion of “qualia” indeed points towards 
something important about at least some sensations. The 
experiential quality of pain, for instance, is a necessary 
part of what we call ‘pain’; a pain that doesn’t feel painful 
would be no pain. Many influential schools in psychology 
and philosophy try to do without paying much attention to 
the quality of experience and consciousness, and the in-
troduction of “qualia” is a commendable attempt to raise 
attention to such issues. That the quality of experience is 
important for sensations, however, does not necessarily 
imply that is knowable to the subject that has them just by 
having it, nor that it is knowable to that subject only. I will 
now explain why, from a Wittgensteinian point of view, 
both alleged features do not hold. 
2. Knowing one’s own sensations 
The most prominent place in which Wittgenstein discusses 
the two alleged features of sensations that are exhibited in 
by “qualia” is in his considerations on a “private language” 
in his Philosophical Investigations. Of course, Wittgenstein 
does not claim that others can literally feel the instance 
(token) of a pain a person feels in her body at a given time. 
His argument is rather that the character of the pain sensa-
tion cannot be determined solely internally. If sensations 
were private in that sense, there would be no criteria to 
determine that some mental experience is a sensation of 
pain, and not something else. If there were no criteria, the 
experience could be as much a pain sensation as a sensa-
tion of color, or any other sensation, or a name of some-
thing that is not a sensation, or even of nothing at all.  
The believer in the privacy of experience may concur 
that language prepares a place for the sensation, and yet 
hold that what corresponds to this place is knowable to the 
person experiencing the sensation just by experiencing it. 
The believer in “qualia” may claim that this place is pre-
cisely “this private sensation,” and that what the private 
sensation is, is filled by the quality of sensation itself. Fur-
thermore, if ‘pain’ is conceived as a name for some sensa-
tion rather than a family resemblance concept, one can 
always imagine someone to exhibit pain behavior when 
the person is actually not having pain. This was, in the first 
place, the reason for why “inverted qualia” and “zombies”1 
were alleged to be possible. The underlying idea is that 
pain is a self-imitating sensation that reveals itself to the 
person who has it just by having it.  
But from a Wittgensteinian point of view, not only speak-
ing about something in the intersubjectively shared world, 
but also the deictic reference to something like “this inner 
sensation” or “quale” is in need of criteria. If there were no 
such criteria, the person having the pain herself would not 
know that she is having a pain “quale,” rather than some 
other sensation. One may imagine a person who assigns a 
name to a sensation, and recalls the name every time she 
is having the sensation. But how does she recognize that it 
is the same “quale”? She somehow needs to memorize it, 
to impress it upon her mind. The problem then is, however, 
that, without criteria, the person cannot tell if she is memo-
rizing the “quale” right or not. Wittgenstein writes: 
But “I impress it on myself” can only mean: this process 
brings it about that I remember the connexion right in 
the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of 
correctness. One would like to say: whatever is going to 
seem right to me is right. And that only means that here 
we can’t talk about ‘right.’2 
Wittgenstein here points out that memory by itself is not 
sufficient for determining the identity of the assumedly in-
                                                      
1 I put “zombie” in quotation marks to indicate its technical philosophical use, 
according to which “zombies” behave in ways indistinguishable from humans, 
but have no “qualia.” In other uses, zombies are very much beings who have 
mental states, such as the desire to eat humans. “Inverted qualia” allege the 
possibility that some person may has a kind of “qualia” that is different from 
that of others when they are exposed to the same causes. 
2 Wittgenstein 1999. German Original: “‘Ich präge sie mir ein’ kann doch nur 
heißen: dieser Vorgang bewirkt, daß ich mich in Zukunft richtig an die Verbin-
dung erinnere. Aber in unserm Falle habe ich ja kein Kriterium für die Richtig-
keit. Man möchte hier sagen: richtig ist, was immer mir als richtig erscheinen 
wird. Und das heißt nur, daß hier von ‘richtig’ nicht geredet werden kann.” (LU, 
§258)

ner sensation throughout different instantiations; the per-
son having the sensation cannot know just from some in-
stance of memory that she has the same sensation. There 
need to be identity criteria, and these are not given with 
the quality of the sensation itself. Rather they are provided 
by the deictic reference to “this sensation.” The identity of 
a phenomenal quality cannot be determined from the qual-
ity by itself. Having an experience is different from knowing 
that one has “this” sensation, even if the “this” is deter-
mined in some idiosyncratic way. Of course, the person 
(and only her) who has some sensation has it, and that 
usually means that she is aware of it. But to know that she 
has “this” inner sensation, having some experience is not 
enough. The role of qualitative experiences is not that of a 
self-imitating sensation. For instance, what the quality of a 
pain is, is not revealed by the sensation of pain in itself. 
One thus does not know what one’s pain is like just by 
having it. From a Wittgensteinian point of view, the first 
alleged feature of “qualia” does not hold; if there are 
“qualia,” they are not knowable to the subject that has 
them just by having them. 
3. Knowing the sensations of others 
But what does this mean for the second alleged feature, 
that qualia are only knowable to the subject that has them? 
The knowledge in question here is not a knowledge-how to 
identify some sensation, but a knowledge-that some sen-
sation is “this” sensation. If it was merely a knowledge-
how, there would be no need to introduce the notion of 
“qualia”; even the theories “qualia” are supposed to con-
tradict recognize that identifying a sensation involves 
knowledge-how to identify it, and yet deny that knowing 
the “what it’s like” of a sensation matters for what the sen-
sation is. Functionalism, for instance, alleges that pain can 
be described solely in functional terms. To argue against 
theories like functionalism, the proponents of “qualia” have 
to hold that the quality of the sensations in question here is 
not merely contingently associated with what the sensation 
is about, but a necessary part of it. 
Nevertheless, arguments around “inverted qualia” and 
“zombies” allege that the quality of the sensation can be 
different for different persons; what a pain (or color) is can 
allegedly be different for different persons. But is such a 
view may be informed more by the theoretical notion that 
the comparison can be done purely internally than by an 
actual consideration of how one usually recalls sensations. 
I think that considering how sensations are recalled and 
compared reveals that it is not an easy or unambiguous 
task, and that it is not enough to just compare some mem-
ory of the sensation of a past pain with a current sensation 
of pain. 
The situation in which we have to try to remember if a 
current pain is the same as one had before is not uncom-
mon. A doctor may ask if the pain in the shoulder still feels 
the same it did before a surgery. To some extend, one 
may try to reenact the sensation at a moment when one 
does not perceive the pain, and judge from memory if the 
current pain is the same as some pain one had before. To 
be able to answer the doctor’s question, one will usually 
recur to criteria. For instance, one may try to recall if the 
pain one has had before restricted certain movements, or 
made it impossible to work, or what one had told other 
people about it. Other criteria for comparing the quality of 
the former pain, such as if it was dumb or sharp, can be 
applied without remembering the exact sensation. The 
person who had the pain may be in the best position for 
applying such criteria, but that does not mean that the per-
son is the only one who can do so. For instance, the per-
son or others may look up in a protocol what the person 
had said about their pain before, and compare it to how 
the person describes her current pain. Such comparisons 
from memory are aided by criteria that are at least poten-
tially knowable by others. 
According to Wittgenstein’s citation from above, it is 
never enough to simply point to something like “this quale”; 
deictic reference is only possible within a language. 
Speaking of “this x” is a language game that depends on 
the structure of the respective language, the ways it is 
used, and the behaviors it is embedded in. So even if one 
could simply name “qualia” by pointing to “this sensation,” 
what that sensation could possibly be in any language is 
not independent of at least potentially public criteria.  
This does not have to contradict the idea that there is still 
something to the quality of sensations like pain than is at-
tainable to criteria of a language. Since language and con-
crete experience are not the same, any attempts to ex-
press the exact quality of the concrete experience in lan-
guage must remain provisional. What is unattainable to 
criteria is, however, not in itself sufficiently differentiated to 
count as a “quale.” Furthermore, “qualia” are asserted to 
not only concern token experiences, but types of qualities 
of experiences. What is alleged is the possibility of a sys-
tematic difference in the type of quality of experience be-
tween different perceivers. This may be true in the follow-
ing sense: there may be some experiential quality that 
some individuals systematically associate with certain ex-
periences, and others don’t. But, as I said above, the qual-
ity of pain sensations in question here is not merely con-
tingently associated with the sensation of pain, but a nec-
essary part of it. 
Because the quality of sensation is a necessary part of 
pain sensations, and there are public criteria to determine 
what counts as the respective quality, others who have 
experiences of that type can know in principle what it is like 
for the other person to experience pain. If there is a knowl-
edge-that to the quality of sensations, then it is knowable 
to others as much as to the person who has the sensation. 
It is not true that only the person having the experience 
knows what it’s like to have the experience.  
Both features of the claim that there are “qualia” to sub-
jective experience are misled: Neither is the quality of sen-
sations in the sense needed for “qualia” only knowable to 
the subject that has them just by having them, nor are they 
knowable to that subject only.

Frege und das Paradox der Analyse 
Günther Eder 
Vienna, Austria | guenther.eder@univie.ac.at  
Abstract 
Das Paradox der Analyse besagt in seiner gängigsten Form: Keine begriffliche Analyse kann beides sein — korrekt und infor-
mativ. In diesem Beitrag werde ich zeigen, wie es dazu hat kommen können, dass Frege, in einer Rezension von Husserls Phi-
losophie der Arithmetik, dieses Paradox explizit formuliert, wie er unmittelbar darauf reagiert und wie sich seine Reaktion mit 
seinen späteren Ansichten zu Analyse verträgt. Als Schluss wird sich ein Dilemma ergeben: Frege vertritt in seiner Husserl-
Rezension entweder eine unplausible, schlecht argumentierte, mit seiner reifen Sicht inkonsistente Position oder er sagt über-
haupt nichts zu dem Problem, das er selbst formuliert. 
 
 
I Das Paradox der Analyse 
Angenommen wir wollen den Begriff des Wissens analy-
sieren und schlagen vor, das Analysandum „Wissen“ durch 
das Analysans „gerechtfertigte, wahre Überzeugung“ zu 
charakterisieren. Damit diese Analyse korrekt ist, so 
scheint es, müssen Analysans und Analysandum dasselbe 
bedeuten. Wenn das aber so ist, sollte jeder der die bei-
den Begriffe versteht auch wissen, dass sie dasselbe be-
deuten. In dem Fall ist die Analyse aber uninformativ. Eine 
gelungene Analyse scheint uns aber irgendetwas beibrin-
gen zu können. Wenn die Analyse „Wissen ist gerechtfer-
tigte, wahre Überzeugung“ korrekt ist, dann lernt man et-
was, wenn man sie hört und versteht. Wenn eine Analyse 
also richtig ist, kann sie uns nichts sagen und wenn sie 
uns etwas sagt, kann sie nicht richtig sein. Das ist das Pa-
radox der Analyse. 
Im Folgenden möchte ich zeigen, wie es — ausgehend 
von der Analyse des Begriffs der Kardinalzahl — dazu hat 
kommen können, dass Frege 1894, in einer Rezension 
von Husserls Philosophie der Arithmetik, dieses Dilemma 
explizit formuliert und wie er darauf reagiert. 
II Freges Grundlagen-Programm 
Um den Hintergrund von Freges Husserl-Rezension bes-
ser zu verstehen, sehen wir uns zuerst kurz Freges logi-
zistisches Programm aus den Grundlagen der Arithmetik 
(1884) an. Das Ziel dort war  zu zeigen dass die Wahrhei-
ten der Arithmetik verkappte logische Wahrheiten sind und 
also entgegen Kants Ansicht analytisch. Frege zeigt dazu, 
dass man die Kardinalzahlen durch logische Begriffe defi-
nieren kann und dass man mit Hilfe dieser Definitionen die 
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik aus logischen Prinzipien ab-
leiten kann. Das erfordert natürlich einiges an analytischer 
Vorarbeit. Die beiden wesentlichen Desiderata auf die 
Frege bei seiner Analyse des Zahlbegriffs stößt sind, dass 
Anzahlaussagen Aussagen über Begriffe beinhalten und 
dass die Zahlen selbst abstrakte Gegenstände sind. Das 
Prinzip, das diesen Desiderata Rechnung trägt wird heute 
oft „Hume’s Principle“ (im Folgenden HP) genannt und be-
sagt: Die Anzahl der F’s ist gleich der Anzahl der G’s, dann 
und nur dann wenn die Begriffe F und G gleichzahlig sind, 
d.h. wenn es eine ein-eindeutige Zuordnung zwischen den 
F’s und den G’s gibt. Frege definiert dann im weiteren den 
Anzahloperator „die Anzahl der F’s“ als „Umfang des Beg-
riffs ‚gleichzahlig dem Begriff F‘“. Die Kardinalzahlen sind 
demzufolge logische Objekte (Begriffsumfänge oder Men-
gen) und auf Basis dieser Definition leitet Frege dann das 
für Kardinalzahlen konstitutive Prinzip HP her. Frege 
glaubt damit wahrscheinlich gemacht zu haben, dass 
Arithmetik bloß weiter entwickelte Logik ist. 
Dennoch stellt sich die Frage: Sind die Definitionen, auf 
die seine Analyse letztlich führt, adäquat? Frege will ja 
zeigen, dass das, was wir immer schon „die Wahrheiten 
der Arithmetik“ genannt haben, logische Wahrheiten sind 
— und nicht irgendwelche Wahrheiten, die sich aufgrund 
irgendwelcher Definitionen ergeben und die den arithmeti-
schen Sätzen mehr oder weniger ähneln. Mit Michael Nel-
son könnte man also meinen: „What the logicist needs is 
[…] analytic definitions“ (Nelson 2008, 161), also Definitio-
nen, die den Gehalt der prä-theoretischen Begriffe, die sie 
definieren, vollständig erfassen. 
Dass Frege solche Fragen nicht von vornherein abtut, 
sieht man an verschiedenen Stellen in den Grundlagen. 
Unmittelbar nach seiner expliziten Definition der Anzahlen 
meint er etwa: „Dass diese Erklärung zutreffe, wird zu-
nächst vielleicht wenig einleuchten. Denkt man sich unter 
dem Umfange eines Begriffes nicht etwas anderes?“ (Fre-
ge 1884, 101) Frege beantwortet diese Frage in  den 
Grundlagen in etwa so: Ja, es klingt komisch zu sagen, 
dass Zahlen in Wirklichkeit Begriffsumfänge sind. Aber das 
ist unwichtig, solange man die „bekannten Eigenschaften“ 
der Zahlen (also im wesentlichen HP) aus dieser Definition 
ableiten kann. (Frege 1884, 102) Freges Grundlagen-
Antwort auf die Frage von Joan Weiner „Aber sind die Zah-
len wirklich Extensionen von Begriffen?“ (Weiner 2004, 66) 
scheint also zu sein: Wen kümmerts? 
III Husserls Kritik 
An Husserls Philosophie der Arithmetik (1891) ist für unse-
re Zwecke vor allem seine Kritik an Frege wichtig. Einer 
der zentralen Kritikpunkte ist, dass nach Husserl die bei-
den Seiten von HP nicht „inhaltsgleich“ sind und deshalb 
HP nicht die zentrale Rolle haben kann, die Frege diesem 
Prinzip zuzuschreiben scheint. So meint er: “Die Definition 
der Äquivalenz ist [...] nicht mehr als ein blosses Kriterium 
für den Bestand der Gleichheit der Anzahl zweier Mengen 
[...]. Aber es ist nicht richtig, dass ‘Äquivalenz’ und ‘gleiche 
Anzahl’ Begriffe von demselben Inhalte sind; nur das ist 
richtig, dass ihr Umfang derselbe ist.”
1 (Husserl 1891, 126) 
Dieselbe Kritik überträgt sich dann auf Freges explizite 
Definition der Kardinalzahlen als Mengen einander gleich-
zahliger Mengen: „Zwischen dem, was wir in Übereinstim-
mung mit dem allgemeinen Sprachgebrauche in Leben 
und Wissenschaft Anzahlen nennen, und dem, was nach 
dieser Theorie so benannt sein soll, besteht […] keinerlei 
                                                      
1 „Äquivalenz“ ist Husserls Ausdruck für das, was Frege „Gleichzahligkeit“ 
nennt, also ein-eindeutige Zuordenbarkeit.

Gemeinsamkeit.“ (Husserl 1891, 127) Husserls Hauptkri-
tikpunkt ist also, dass Frege’s Definitionen nicht den „In-
halt“ des „alltäglichen“ Zahlbegriffs erfassen würden. Was 
Husserl hier unter „Inhalt“ versteht, sieht man an folgender 
Stelle: „Sich zwei gleichzahlige Vielheiten vorstellen, und 
sich zwei Vielheiten gliedweise gegenseitig zugeordnet 
vorstellen, ist nicht ein- und dasselbe. Die Definition spricht 
einen wahren, nicht aber einen identischen Satz aus.“ 
(Husserl 1891, 107) Inhaltsgleich wären beide Seiten von 
HP also nur wenn wir uns dasselbe „vorstellen“ würden. 
Dasselbe gilt für Freges explizite Definition: Wir stellen uns 
unter den Kardinalzahlen eben keine Begriffsumfänge vor. 
Husserl meint aber nicht nur, dass Freges „merkwürdiger 
Versuch“ (Husserl 1891, 129) die Anzahlen logisch zu de-
finieren, verfehlt ist — sondern dass alle Versuche, den 
Begriff der Zahl zu definieren, zum scheitern verurteilt sind. 
Der Schluss, den Husserl aus diesem Umstand zieht ist, 
dass wir bloß die „psychischen Prozesse“ beschreiben 
können, die für die Bildung des Zahlbegriffs erforderlich 
sind. (Husserl 1891, 131) 
IV Freges Husserl-Rezension 
Husserls gesamtes Projekt ist für Frege natürlich ein rotes 
Tuch. Für Frege haben „Grundlegung der Mathematik“ und 
„Analyse des Zahlbegriffs“ nichts mit einer Untersuchung 
der psychischen Prozesse zu tun, die nötig sind, damit 
jemand den Begriff der Zahl in seinem Verstand bildet. 
Freges Urteil in seiner Rezension (1894) von Husserls Phi-
losophie der Arithmetik fällt auch dementsprechend 
schlecht aus. Frege führt auch Husserls Einwände gegen 
seine Definitionen auf dessen Mixtur aus Mathematik, Lo-
gik und Psychologie zurück: „Aus der eben gekennzeich-
neten psychologisch-logischen Denkweise ist es leicht zu 
verstehen, wie der Verfasser über Definitionen urteilt.“ 
(Frege 1894, 182) Unmittelbar anschließend formuliert 
Frege dann das Paradox der Analyse, einmal in „psycho-
logischer“ und einmal „semantischer“ Form. Die psycholo-
gische Variante sieht so aus: „Wenn Wörter und Wortver-
bindungen Vorstellungen bedeuten, so ist es bei zweien 
von solchen nichts weiter möglich, als dass sie entweder 
dieselbe oder verschiedene Vorstellungen bezeichnen. Im 
ersten Falle ist ihre Gleichsetzung durch eine Definition 
zwecklos, ‚ein offener Zirkel’; im andern ist sie falsch.“ 
(Frege 1894, 183) Mit dem Wort „Vorstellungen“ meint 
Frege hier natürlich die zur Psychologie gehörigen subjek-
tiven Bilder im Geiste einer bestimmten Person. Aber 
„auch den Sinn zu zerlegen, vermag eine Definition nicht; 
denn der zerlegte Sinn ist eben nicht der ursprüngliche. 
Entweder ich denke bei dem zu erklärenden Worte schon 
alles deutlich, was ich beim definierenden Ausdruck den-
ke, dann haben wir den ‚offenbaren Zirkel‘; oder der defi-
nierende Ausdruck hat einen reicher gegliederten Sinn, 
dann denke ich bei ihm nicht dasselbe wie bei dem zu er-
klärenden: Die Definition ist falsch.“ (ebd.) Frege hat zu 
diesem Zeitpunkt schon die Unterscheidung zwischen 
Sinn und Bedeutung getroffen. Der Begriff „Sinn“ verweist 
hier also auf den objektiven semantischen Gehalt eines 
Ausdrucks, im Gegensatz sowohl zu seiner Bedeutung als 
auch der subjektiven Vorstellungen, die wir mit ihm verbin-
den. 
Frege bietet dann auch gleich — zumindest sehen das 
die meisten Interpreten so — eine Auflösung des Dilem-
mas an. Frege zufolge offenbart das Problem nämlich ei-
nen „Zwiespalt zwischen psychologischen Logikern und 
Mathematikern“. So meint er: „Jenen kommt es auf den 
Sinn der Worte an und auf die Vorstellungen, die sie von 
dem Sinne nicht unterscheiden, diesen dagegen auf die 
Sache selbst, auf die Bedeutung der Worte.“ (ebd.) Um die 
Situation aufzuklären, diskutiert Frege dann kurz zwei po-
tentielle Definitionen des Begriffs „Kegelschnitt“. Die eine 
Definition setzt fest, dass ein Kegelschnitt die Schnittkante 
einer Ebene und eines Kreiskegelmantels ist und die an-
dere definiert einen Kegelschnitt als ebene Kurve, deren 
Gleichung in Parallelkoordinaten vom zweiten Grad ist. 
Sein Kommentar dazu: „Welche von diesen beiden oder 
noch andern er [der Mathematiker, G.E.] auswählt, richtet 
sich allein nach Zweckmäßigkeitsgründen, obwohl diese 
Ausdrücke weder denselben Sinn haben, noch dieselben 
Vorstellungen erwecken.“ (Frege 1894, 184) Was Frege 
als Resultat dieser Diskussion anzusehen scheint ist also 
einerseits ein Adäquatheitskriterium für korrekte Definitio-
nen und gleichzeitig eine Auflösung für das Paradox der 
Analyse. Repräsentativ für diese Interpretation sei hier Mi-
chael Beaney zitiert, der meint: „Frege’s […] response to 
the paradox of analysis can thus be stated as follows. An 
analysis of the form ‘A is C’ is correct if ‘A’ and ‘C’ have the 
same Bedeutung, and informative if ‘C’ has a ‘more richly 
articulated sense’ than ‚A’ […]“. (Beaney 2004, 122) 
Wenn diese Interpretation richtig ist dann ist aber einiges 
an Freges Diskussion verwirrend. Um einen klareren Blick 
dafür zu bekommen, was, ist es sinnvoll einen kurzen Aus-
flug ins Jahr 1914 zu machen.  
V Freges Logik in der Mathematik 
Im Fragment Logik in der Mathematik macht Frege eine 
Unterscheidung zwischen zwei Arten von Definitionen. Auf 
der einen Seite gibt es die sogenannten „aufbauenden“ 
oder „eigentlichen“ Definitionen. (Frege 1914, 227 ff.) De-
finitionen dieser Art sind rein stipulativ. Einem einfachen 
Zeichen wird durch so eine Definition ein Sinn und eine 
Bedeutung erst gegeben. Definitionen dieser Art müssen 
nur gewissen formalen Standards (Eliminierbarkeit, Kon-
servativität, etc.) genügen, um korrekt zu sein. Kurz: ei-
gentliche Definitionen sind bloße Abkürzungen. 
Auf der anderen Seite gibt es dann noch das, was Frege 
„zerlegende Definitionen“ nennt. Bei Definitionen dieser Art 
wird der Sinn eines schon in Gebrauch befindlichen Zei-
chens in einfachere Bestandteile zerlegt. Diese Art „Defini-
tion“ ist also das, was bei Frege dem Begriff der „Analyse“ 
entspricht. Für die Korrektheit einer zerlegenden Definition 
gibt es jetzt auch ein inhaltliches Adäquatheitskriterium: 
der analysierende und der analysierte Ausdruck müssen, 
so Frege, sinngleich sein. Ohne hier auf den Begriff des 
„Sinns“ oder der „Sinngleichheit“ näher eingehen zu kön-
nen, muss man sich fragen: woher können wir wissen, 
wann analysierter und analysierender Ausdruck denselben 
Sinn haben? Freges Antwort darauf ist: Manchmal ist das 
„unmittelbar einleuchtend“ — manchmal nicht. In jedem 
Fall sollten wir, falls das nicht klar ist, den alten Begriff ein-
fach wegwerfen und ein neues Zeichen einführen, das — 
qua aufbauender Definition — den Sinn des Analysans 
bekommen soll. (Frege 1914, 228) 
Die wesentlichen Punkte dieser späteren Diskussion 
können wir demnach so zusammenfassen: Erstens ist für 
eine korrekte Analyse notwendig, dass Analysans und 
Analysandum sinngleich sind. Zweitens ist das aber irrele-
vant beim Aufbau einer systematischen Wissenschaft (ins-
besondere der Mathematik), weil zerlegende Definitionen 
dem Aufbau des Systems nur vorausgehen und im System 
der Wissenschaft nur mehr aufbauende Definitionen vor-
kommen.2 
                                                      
2 Freges späte Auffassung ist sichtlich nahe an dem, was Carnap später „Ex-
plikation“ oder „rationale Rekonstruktion“ nennt. Vgl. (Beaney 2004)

VI Noch einmal Freges Husserl-Rezension 
Wenn wir wieder zu Freges Husserl-Rezension in das Jahr 
1894 zurückgehen, dann fallen nun mehrere Unzuläng-
lichkeiten an der früheren Diskussion auf. Die Frage, die 
sich zunächst stellt, ist: Von welcher Art „Definitionen“, zer-
legenden oder aufbauenden, meint Frege hier angeblich, 
dass sie nur — aber doch immerhin — extensional adä-
quat sein müssen? 
Die Antwort scheint zunächst klar zu sein: er muss von 
zerlegenden Definitionen reden. An das, was er später 
aufbauende Definitionen nennt, werden ja überhaupt keine 
inhaltlichen Kritierien gestellt. Falls Frege andererseits 
über zerlegende Definitionen spricht, dann ist seine Positi-
on offenbar nicht nur inkonsistent mit seiner späteren Auf-
fassung — auch seine Argumentation dafür  ist schwach. 
Wir erinnern uns: In der Husserl-Rezension sieht er sich 
zwei alternative Definitionen des Begriffs „Kegelschnitt“ an. 
Das Beispiel soll dann offenbar zeigen dass von einer zer-
legenden Definition sinnvollerweise nur Bedeutungs-
gleichheit von Analysans und Analysandum gefordert wer-
den sollte. Das Kegelschnitt-Beispiel sollte also folgendes 
Prinzip stützen: 
(ExAd) Wenn zwei Begriffe K und K’ bedeutungsgleich 
sind, ist die zerlegende Definition K = K’ korrekt. 
Das tut es aber offenbar nicht! Was das Beispiel besten-
falls zeigt, ist dass die zerlegende Definition K = K1 dann 
und nur dann korrekt ist wenn es die zerlegende Definition 
K = K2 ist. Das allein liefert aber noch kein „absolutes“ Kri-
terium für die Korrektheit von zerlegenden Definitionen. Es 
sagt uns nur, dass zwei Begriffe K1 und K2 gleichermaßen 
gut als zerlegende Definitionen eines prä-theoretischen 
Begriffs K geeignet sind, falls sie bedeutungsgleich sind — 
nicht aber wann eine der beiden Definitionen tatsächlich 
korrekt ist. 
Das Beispiel zeigt aber nicht einmal das. Eine Beson-
derheit des Beispiels ist nämlich, dass die beiden Kegel-
schnittsbegriffe nicht bloß bedeutungsgleich, sondern be-
weisbar bedeutungsgleich sind.
3 D.h. das Beispiel zeigt 
nur, dass zwei alternative zerlegende Definitionen K = K1 
und K = K2 „äqui-korrekt“ sind, falls die Begriffe K1 und K2 
beweisbar bedeutungsgleich sind. Das aber reicht sicher-
lich nicht aus um (ExAd) auch nur plausibel erscheinen zu 
lassen. Kurz: folgen wir der ersten Interpretation, dann ver-
tritt Frege eine unplausible Position zu zerlegenden Defini-
tionen, die inkonsistent ist mit seiner späteren Auffassung, 
und die noch dazu unzureichend argumentiert ist. 
                                                      
3 Dieser Punkt wurde auch von (Dummett 1991, 32) betont. 
Es gibt aber eine Alternative. Wir können Frege auch so 
verstehen, dass er an dieser Stelle gar kein Argument für 
(ExAd) 
liefern, 
sondern 
etwas 
über 
aufbauende 
Definitionen sagen will. Das Kegelschnittsbeispiel will — 
unter dieser Interpretation — unsere Aufmerksamkeit auf 
den Umstand lenken, dass im Rahmen eines schon etab-
lierten Systems der Mathematik zwei beweisbar bedeu-
tungsgleiche Bedingungen gleich gut geeignet sind, um 
einem als leer angesehenen Zeichen eine Bedeutung zu-
zuweisen. Und dem würde (modulo Zweckmäßigkeitser-
wägungen) vermutlich wirklich jeder „Mathematiker“ zu-
stimmen. Diese Interpretation hat keinen der Nachteile der 
ersten Interpretation, andererseits sagt Frege dann auch 
nichts zum Paradox der Analyse und reagiert in Wahrheit 
gar nicht auf Husserl, dem es ja um den prä-theoretischen 
Gehalt des Zahlbegriffs geht. 
Freges Diskussion in seiner Husserl-Rezension wirft also 
ein Dilemma auf: Entweder vertritt Frege eine unplausible, 
mit seiner späteren Auffassung inkonsistente Position zu 
zerlegenden Definitionen, und zwar basierend auf einem 
schlechten Argument oder er vertritt überhaupt keine Posi-
tion zu zerlegenden Definitionen, formuliert zwar in Reakti-
on auf Husserl das Paradox der Analyse, bietet aber keine 
Lösung an und wechselt einfach das Thema. Ich denke 
keine der beiden Alternativen ist besonders attraktiv.

Looking through a microscope. Philosophische Bemerkungen 
1938: the hidden revision which fits the 1938 Vorwort, the Rhees 
translation and what this tells us about Wittgenstein’s philosophy 
of mathematics and cosmology 
Susan Edwards-McKie

Abstract 
I set out an argument which uses new evidence for a joining of TSS 220 and 221, but, as it will have its own variations with the 
new evidence considered, it will both support earlier work by the Wittgenstein scholarly community on the Frhfassung and offer 
new exegetic reflections.  This Nachlass discovery is contextualised within ideas of the Vienna Circle and Viennese modernism 
and, more specifically, the Whewell Court lectures of 1938. 
Three forms of triangulation of what I here call the Hidden Revision became significant. Firstly, the Hidden Revision provides the 
projected title Philosophische Bemerkungen rather than Philosophische Untersuchungen.  Secondly, when constructed it is 
shown to correlate faithfully with the Rhees translation and numbering. Thirdly, as the consecutive numbering has been estab-
lished across all of TS220 before the cuts for TS239 occur, the Hidden Revision and the TS239 project become indisputably 
distinct with the latter dated 1944, for which the Smythies translation provides corroboration.  
Fourthly, a beginning system of extra numberings beside the Hidden Revision numbering of remarks is considered, with sug-
gestions for Wittgensteinian mathematics and cosmology. 
 
 
Placing of the Hidden Revision physically 
and topographically 
When reading TS239 I became aware that there was an 
earlier numbering of the remarks which had been partially 
erased.  After several months of close examination I have 
been able to reconstruct this numbering by using TSS 239, 
238 and 237.  It forms a virtually unblemished continuation 
of consecutive numbering which fits seamlessly onto the 
first numbering visible in TS222.  Thus we have remarks 1-
192 established as the Hidden Revision of TS220 and re-
marks 193-316 established as a continuation not merely in 
pagination but in remark numbering of the reconstructed 
TS221from the clippings of TS222. 
 
Numbers 188 and 189 of the Hidden Revision 
Evidence showed that this was not merely an early version 
of the TS239 project.  The Smythies translation of remarks 
35-140 follows TS239  (Papers of Yoricke Smythies 
,Notebook XIII, Box 3, Trinity), with the added remark 125 
(Rothhaupt sources 125 from MS127,73; 27.2.44), and the 
translation that Rhees and Wittgenstein worked on to-
gether follows the Hidden Revision numberings.  I com-
pleted the reconstruction before consulting TS226, thus it 
offers a strong form of triangulation.  The added pages, 
1,2,2a, at the front of this first section fit with the Rhees 
translation, thus this insertion was completed at the time of 
the Hidden Revision.   
 
 
Shaded areas show TS239 project and correlate with the 
Smythies translation 
Looking through a magnifying glass, the first page of  
TS239 reveals that “Untersuchungen” has been scratched 
through and “Bemerkungen” written in above. In addition, 
above the title on this first page, written in pencil and par-
tially erased is a quotation from Grillparzer, which appears 
to act as an introductory quotation to Wittgenstein’s book. 
This suggests that Wittgenstein had started on this textual 
revision before he submitted to CUP, which would offer 
some explanation of the fact that the ‘clean’ TS220 com-
prises a carbon for pp.1-65 and then reverts to the top 
clean copy for the remainder of the text.   
 
In detail, the Trinity TS220: 1-65 is a carbon of TS239: 1-
65, both the top copy and the carbon (s) on strong, middle-
weight manila paper. In TS239: 1,2 & 2a  have been in-
serted at the front; this text  has been typed out on smaller 
sheets, on an English machine, and placed at the front of  
Trinity TS220 because page 1 of the original TS220 is 
missing. At page 66, TS239 reverts to carbon, TS220 to 
top copy, on lighter-weight paper, reverting to original mid-
dle-weight paper 93-137.  TS220: 66- 137 is the top copy.  
From page 66 TS239 all is carbon, and there appears to

be two carbons in play as TS239 is created, as third ex-
emplars are present in the clippings of TS237. Von Wright 
also states that there are three exemplars of this particular 
TS220.   
Wittgenstein used MS117 as a centralising volume, with 
pages 1-97, 1937/38, acting as consolidation of MSS 118 
and 119, and the second Vorworts (110-126) completed in 
August 1938 in Cambridge.  It is worth noting that the con-
secutive numbering of remarks across TS220 and the por-
tion of TS221 up to Remark 316 creates a neat numbering 
in TS221 which ends just as the first section of MS117 
ends on page 97.   
Placing of the Hidden Revision exegetically 
and historically 
The Vorwort of 1938 has always been problematic, with 
conjectures that the 1938  CUP submission must have 
been TS220 and TS221 (Schulte and Hacker 2009). How-
ever, there is disagreement on what constitutes the frag-
ment which Wittgenstein alludes to in this Vorwort.   
Schulte is unclear on the specific point of the reference of 
the fragment, but his critical edition reflects the conjunction 
of the two TSS; Pichler (2004) conjectures that TS220 is 
the fragment and TS221 is to be joined with it as the addi-
tional promised remarks, possibly at a later date;  while 
Hacker shifts his position to the two being submitted jointly 
in 1938, early Baker and Hacker agree with Pichler, con-
jecturing that the numberings were probably on a separate 
sheet to be added at some point of completion, but de-
stroyed when this idea was abandoned.   
Another problematic aspect of the 1938 Vorwort is re-
hearsed a few months earlier in the short Vorwort, MS 118: 
95-95 verso, speaking of a network of numberings with 
interrelations, to assist the reader in understanding “durch 
ein Netz von Zahlen so/zu verbinden, dass äusser ist ihr 
komplizierten, Zusam./merhang sichtbar wird”.  Later in the 
Vorwort of 1938 he alludes to the fragment and to the in-
terrelated numbering (MS117: 123). 
 Given the date of the early  MS118 Vorwort,  it is rea-
sonable to argue that the fragment at that point was  
MS142/TS220 as the material for TS221 is in the process 
of being composed: TS221= MSS 117, 118, and 119 ( with 
MSS 121, 115 and 162a represented in the late pages of 
TS221). By the time it reaches MS117 it is a well-
rehearsed argument. This is a point in favour of consider-
ing the first part of MS117, which becomes the first part of 
TS221 onto which the Hidden Revision consecutive con-
tinuation of numbering from TS220 occurs, as a much 
sounder cluster of work than hitherto has been appreci-
ated. Indeed, the title of MS 117 is Philosophische Be-
merkungen.  Relatedly, Edwards-McKie (2014) shows that 
a later conclusion to MS142 cannot be ruled out, which 
would more strongly align the final form of the ending 
ideas of MS142 with the materials of MS117.   
Placing of the Hidden Revision mathemati-
cally and cosmologically 
Of particular relevance is the fact that during this 1937-38 
period Wittgenstein continued to think about infinity, and 
space and time, as evidenced in the catalogued entries of 
his Whewell Court short lectures: “Achilles and the Tor-
toise” and “Absolutely Determinate”.  MS121, begun 
26.4.38 is a critique of the diagonal method as a platon-
ising of Cantor’s transfinite numbers, with Wittgenstein, at 
41 verso, 12.7.38 voicing the absurdity that one infinity 
could be greater than another.   In addition, as is pointed 
out by Munz (2010), Wittgenstein’s criticism of Russell’s 
position in many of the lectures  “leads Wittgenstein to 
question about knowledge and causality” (p. 88), with the 
great distinction between proof and experiment which he 
so thoroughly explored during the Vienna Circle years, in 
TS 213 and in its progenitors TSS 208, 209. 210, 211, 212 
firmly present in these lectures. 
The Second conference of the Epistemology of the Exact 
Sciences, jointly sponsored by the Vienna Circle and the 
Berlin Circle, held at Königsberg 1930 witnessed the im-
portant papers of Gödel, Hilbert, Heyting and  Waismann’s 
presentation  “The Nature of Mathematics: Wittgenstein’s 
Standpoint”, the latter an account which allows Wittgen-
stein a developing mathematics which distinguishes be-
tween set theoretic totalities and Wittgensteinian systems. 
A similar congress in Copenhagen 1936 focused on 
causality and quantum physics.  Wittgenstein’s thinking 
and writing during MS142 and the transition to the materi-
als of TS221, was influenced by concerns to counter Tur-
ing’s set theoretic arguments. My correction of the von 
Wright error which had interpreted the references of 
MS117 to be to TS221, when they were in fact to the ear-
lier Vienna Circle, more mathematical, years of  TS213 
supports this, with the references to questions about what 
it is to think and if there could be an artificial thinking. 
These issues are intimately tied to conceptions of set the-
ory and the actual infinite as opposed to constructivist 
mathematics and the potential infinite, which Wittgenstein 
supported (Edwards-McKie 2012, 2013, 2014).   With the 
Nachlass discovery of the Hidden Revision we find another 
important theme which parallels  philosophy of mathemat-
ics and physics, this time using his systemic argument to 
counter Einstein causality through Wittgensteinian sys-
tems.   
Nedo (1993) suggests a Machian connection in Wittgen-
stein’s early work of the Vienna Circle years, thus we per-
ceive a pattern of holism, which Einstein embraced from 
Mach’s system and which Wittgenstein very much en-
dorsed. However, during the 1936-38 period the way in 
which holism works, whether it is envisaged as causal, as 
Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen held (EPR Paradox 1935) 
or systemically, as Wittgenstein held, was the focus of the 
research community and remains an entrenched research 
issue in contemporary physics and cosmology.  In the 
Whewell Court lectures, when talking about the two seeds: 
“The idea of action/at a distance shocked scientists.  
This/idea [of action at a distance/of indeterminancy] revolu-
tionized science.” (Box 2, Lecture V). Historically, we can 
see that these issues are precisely those which figure 
prominently in defining and developing various strands of 
Viennese modernism, indeed of modernism itself. 
The numerical cross-referencing of remarks 
of the Hidden Revision?  Wittgenstein’s 
action-at-a-distance 
Upon close scrutiny not only is a consecutive renumbering 
visible which allows the construction of the Hidden Revi-
sion, but there also appears to be a beginning  system of 
cross- reference numbering placed beside the current Hid-
den Revision remarks: “ ausserdem/ die Nummern solcher 
Bemerkungen/tragen, die zu ihr in wichtigen Beziehungen/ 
stehen” (MS117:123).  
There is significant cross referencing in the recon-
structed TS221 from TS222, and one cross-reference from 
this reconstruction to the HR numbering of TS220. While

further research is needed to establish my suggestion 
conclusively (Edwards-McKie, forthcoming) what we 
should note at this point is the remarks which Wittgenstein 
has chosen to mark out by extra numbers form a group of 
ideas which have a coherence concerning action at a dis-
tance and how he approaches it through the concept of 
application of a rule, division of a group, and constructing 
and ‘seeing’ an aspect of a proof.  All participate in a type 
of timelessness and are philosophically broader than 
causal ostensive definition (see PG III:39). “How does an 
ostensive definition work? Is it put to work every time the 
word is used, or is it like a vaccination which changes us 
once and for all? This passage then bridges the concept of 
action at a distance and application.  
 
 
 
With these remarks concerned with logical compulsion, 
with divisibility of a group and how this relates to seeing 
aspects (a connection to which many of the proofs in the 
conjugate MSS attest) there is a linking with the impor-
tance of not thinking in terms of the essence of a form 
when considering the possibilities of division. This is where 
action-at-a distance enters, specifically stated in the 
neighbouring passages of 62 and 65, as a counter to a 
cosmology of essentialism and local causal realism. Look-
ing at diagrammatic proofs of division: “Suppose someone 
now asked : ‘What does the action at a distance of the pic-
ture consist in?’- In the fact that I apply it.” (HR: 307; BGM: 
65).  It is necessary that it be brought into a system or we 
might erroneously think a proposition could be true essen-
tially (criticism of Gödel; see also Papers of Yoricke 
Smythies, Lectures on Gödel, forthcoming edition Munz), 
similarly that there is a mental process behind the mean-
ing, that there is a real sign behind our ordinary signs, pla-
tonic numbers behind our constructed series, or that there 
could be a hidden variable explanation in cosmology.

Das Medien-Problem des Philosophierens und Wittgensteins 
Nachlass 
Christian Erbacher 
Bergen, Norway | christian.erbacher@uni.no 
Abstract 
Das Medien-Problem des Philosophierens entsteht bei Versuchen der Verschriftlichung einer operativen Auffassung des Philo-
sophierens. Da Wittgenstein diese vertrat und zudem philosophische Probleme als Probleme der sprachlichen Darstellung be-
handelte, spielte für ihn das Medien-Problem des Philosophierens eine besondere Rolle. Neben expliziter Benennung der Ope-
rativität des Philosophierens hat Wittgenstein so in den verschiedenen Entwürfen seiner schriftlichen Werkgestaltung verschie-
dene Darstellungsmittel entworfen, um dem Medien-Problem des Philosophierens zu entsprechen. Die von Wittgenstein bestell-
ten Nachlassverwalter Rush Rhees, Elizabeth Anscombe und Georg Henrik von Wright waren sich Wittgensteins operativer 
Auffassung des Philosophierens bewusst und wollten ihr bei der Erfüllung ihrer Aufgabe Rechnung tragen. Das Medien-
Problem des Philosophierens setzte sich so als Medien-Problem philosophischen Edierens fort. Der Vortrag skizziert die drei 
unterschiedlichen Umgangsweisen, die Wittgensteins Nachlassverwalter während der Editionsgeschichte von Wittgensteins 
Nachlass als Antworten auf das Medien-Problem philosophischen Edierens entwickelt haben. In einem Ausblick wird auf die 
Nützlichkeit dieser editionshistorischen Einsichten für zukünftige digitale Editionen verwiesen. 
 
 
1. Das Medien-Problem des Philosophie-
rens und Wittgenstein 
In allen Phasen seiner Entwicklung verstand Wittgenstein 
die Philosophie als Tätigkeit: im Tractatus dienten logische 
Operationen der Klärung verschwommener Gedanken; in 
den 30er Jahren sollten Fallunterscheidungen die Gram-
matik zentraler Begriffe übersichtlich offenlegen; in den 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen wurde anhand von Bei-
spielen eine dialogische Methode eingefordert. Diese ope-
rative Auffassung des Philosophierens drückte sich natür-
lich besonders in Wittgensteins Lehrveranstaltungen aus. 
Hier dozierte er nicht, sondern führte mit den Anwesenden 
Untersuchungen durch. Er pflegte, diese Seminarpraxis 
mit dem Spielen eines Instrumentes oder Fingerübungen 
zu dessen Vorbereitung zu vergleichen. Gleichwohl hat 
Wittgenstein zeit seiner philosophischen Arbeit an einer 
Verschriftlichung seines Denkens gearbeitet. Für diese 
stellt eine operative Auffassung eine besondere Heraus-
forderung dar, weil zwischen dem dynamischen Philoso-
phieren im Leben und dem statischen Festhalten auf dem 
Papier eine wesentliche Spannung besteht.  
Dieses „Medien-Problem des Philosophierens“ ist seit 
Platons Aufzeichnungen der sokratischen Dialoge philoso-
phisch aktuell. Da Wittgenstein philosophische Probleme 
als Probleme der sprachlichen Darstellung behandelte, 
spielte für ihn das Medien-Problem des Philosophierens 
eine herausgehobene Rolle. Je entschiedener er zudem 
die operative Auffassung des Philosophierens vertrat, des-
to größer wurde die Herausforderung, ihr schriftlich zu ent-
sprechen. Neben expliziter Benennung der Operativität 
des Philosophierens hat Wittgenstein so in den verschie-
denen Entwürfen seiner schriftlichen Werkgestaltung ver-
schiedene Darstellungsmittel entworfen, um dem Medien-
Problem des Philosophierens zu entsprechen: im Tracta-
tus wurde der Leser durch eine präfinale Wendung aus 
einem potentiellen Lehrgebäude zurück ins Leben gewor-
fen; in den Entwürfen der frühen 30er Jahre wurde der all-
tägliche Gebrauch seiner Schriften durch das Format eines 
Nachschlagewerks vorbestimmt; in den Philosophischen 
Untersuchungen wurden schließlich nicht nur dialogische 
Interaktionen dargestellt, sondern manchmal nur Teil-
Dialoge, die vom denkenden Leser als Gesprächspartner 
unterhalten werden müssen. Dadurch fordern die Philoso-
phischen Untersuchungen die dialogische Praxis des Phi-
losophierens ein.

waren sich als Wittgensteins Schüler und Freunde dessen 
operativer Auffassung des Philosophierens voll bewusst 
und wollten ihr in ihren Editionen Rechnung tragen. Das 
Medien-Problem des Philosophierens wurde so zum Me-
dien-Problem philosophischen Edierens. Entsprechend 
ihrer eigenen Haltung zu jenem entwickelten Wittgensteins 
Nachlassverwalter drei unterschiedliche editorische Um-
gangsweisen mit diesem. 
Rush Rhees war in besonderem Maße von der Unbe-
dingtheit der Dialogizität des Philosophierens überzeugt. 
Er lernte bei Wittgenstein eine Art des Philosophierens, die 
er als Lehrer weiterführte. Rhees wirkte so vor allem als 
philosophischer Gesprächspartner. Als Autor war er be-
strebt, die vornehmen Eigenschaften des dialogischen Phi-
losophierens wie Situiertheit, direkte Reziprozität und ein-
fache Möglichkeit von Themen- und Meinungswechseln 
ins Schriftliche zu überführen. Deshalb war Rhees beson-
ders vom Medien-Problem des Philosophierens betroffen, 
so dass er in seinen eigenen Schriften ein Leben lang mit 
angemessenen Darstellungen rang; mehr als der monolo-
gische Aufsatz entsprach ihm daher auch das Format des 
Briefes als schriftliche Form eines dialogischen Philoso-
phierens. 
Als Herausgeber war Rhees aufgrund seiner philosophi-
schen Haltung besonders sensibel für Wittgensteins litera-
rische Lösungen des Medien-Problems des Philosophie-
rens. Er wollte in seinen Editionen Wittgensteins Stimme 
vernehmbar machen so wie er sie vernommen hatte. Da-
her war die Maßgabe seiner Editionspraxis, nur zu veröf-
fentlichen, was Wittgenstein selbst veröffentlicht hätte: mit 
den von ihm herausgegebenen Büchern wollte Rhees 
Wittgensteins Intentionen ausführen. Dadurch entstand 
allerdings das Medien-Problem auf zweiter Stufe: um die 
unvollendeten Werkgestaltungen zu edieren, musste 
Rhees diese aus einem inneren Verständnis heraus voll-
enden. Der Herausgeber trat so zwischen Autor und Leser

 80
und die Edition war eine Darstellung der Resultate eines 
dialogischen Philosophierens zwischen Herausgeber und 
zu edierendem Text. Edieren und Philosophieren gingen 
so bei Rhees ineinander über.  
Rhees entsprach mit seiner editorischen Haltung, Witt-
gensteins Absichten auszuführen, der geforderten Dialogi-
zität der Philosophischen Untersuchungen; die Güte der 
Edition hing allerdings in hohem Maße von der philosophi-
schen Arbeit, von der Persönlichkeit, der speziellen Ein-
sicht, Intuition und Redlichkeit des Herausgebers ab. In 
der Editionsgeschichte von Wittgensteins Nachlass hat 
das gerade hinsichtlich der Darstellung der operativen Auf-
fassung des Philosophierens zu Kontroversen geführt: 
Rhees klammerte das „Methoden-Kapitel“ Philosophie des 
Big Typescript aus seiner Edition der Philosophischen 
Grammatik aus, da er der Meinung war, dass man nicht 
sagen könne, worin Philosophieren für Wittgenstein be-
standen habe, sondern dass man dies durch Übung erfah-
ren müsse. 
Rhees’ Bestreben, ein getreues Bild des sprechenden 
und lebendig philosophierenden Wittgenstein darzustellen, 
zeigt sich auch in seinen oder durch ihn motivierten Editio-
nen von Vorlesungsnotizen und Mitschriften (z.B. Wittgen-
stein’s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics). An 
deren Veröffentlichung lässt sich außerdem gut der Unter-
schied zwischen Rhees’ und Anscombes editorischer Um-
gangsweise mit Wittgensteins operativer Auffassung des 
Philosophierens erkennen: Anscombe war strikt dagegen, 
Wittgensteins Notizen zusammen mit Vorlesungsaufzeich-
nungen zu veröffentlichen, und stand einer Veröffentli-
chung von Vorlesungsmitschriften skeptisch gegenüber. 
Sie war der Meinung, dass solche Veröffentlichungen zwar 
denjenigen, die Wittgenstein erlebt hatten, die Erinnerung 
wieder vor Augen führen könnten; denjenigen aber, die 
Wittgenstein nicht erlebt hatten, könnten sie nicht das rich-
tige Bild vermitteln. Anscombe wollte sich als Herausgebe-
rin von Wittgensteins Nachlass daher auf das beschrän-
ken, was von Wittgenstein wirklich so gut wie zur Veröf-
fentlichung autorisiert worden war. Entsprechend dieser 
Einstellung konzentrierte sie sich auf die Herausgabe der 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen und maß der Darstel-
lung von Zwischenstufen nur mäßige Bedeutung zu; im 
Extrem bedeutet das allerdings, es neben dem zu Lebzei-
ten veröffentlichten Tractatus bei der Edition der Philoso-
phischen Untersuchungen zu belassen. 
Anscombes Festhalten an einem autorisierten Text 
stand allerdings nicht im Widerspruch zu einer operativen 
Auffassung des Philosophierens. Vielmehr drückte sich 
darin ebenso gerade diese Haltung aus, wenn auch auf 
andere Weise als bei Rhees. Denn auch für Anscombe 
war Philosophie eine Tätigkeit, aber sie hatte nicht den 
Anspruch, den lebendigen Prozess des Philosophierens 
ins Schriftliche abzubilden. Vielmehr war für sie ein klar 
geschriebener schriftlicher Aufsatz ein Beitrag in einem 
anhaltenden philosophischen Dialog. Die dialogische Auf-
fassung des Philosophierens wird dabei vorausgesetzt und 
wird daher nicht Schriftlichen problematisch. Sie ist Ein-
stellung und Haltung des Menschen außerhalb der Text-
gestaltung und zeigt sich darin, wie man mit dem schriftli-
chen Text umgeht. Der Text selbst bedarf dabei keiner 
besonderen Darstellungsform, sondern kann – wie eine 
einzelne Äußerung in einem Gespräch – ganz monolo-
gisch abgefasst sein. Diese Umgangsweise entspricht ei-
ner Analyse des Medien-Problems in seine Elemente und 
erlaubt den Bedingungen verschiedener Medien zuguns-
ten der Fokussierung auf das besprochene Argument ge-
trennt Rechnung zu tragen. Anscombe entsprach so der 
von Wittgenstein geerbten operativen Auffassung des Phi-
losophierens und der geforderten Dialogizität der Philoso-
phischen Untersuchungen dadurch, dass sie die Argumen-
te und Methoden Wittgensteins in ihren eigenen Untersu-
chungen aufnahm und entwickelte. 
Man mag meinen, dass mit Rhees’ und Anscombes edi-
torischen Antworten auf das Medien-Problem des Philoso-
phierens zwei Prototypen antithetisch nebeneinander 
stünden. Tatsächlich entwickelte aber der dritte Herausge-
ber von Wittgensteins Nachlass eine dritte Art der Ent-
sprechung. Von Wright war wohl mit Rhees einig, dass 
man ein richtiges Bild von Wittgenstein als sprechende 
Person haben müsse, um seine philosophischen Bemer-
kungen richtig zu lesen. Jedoch hielt er es als Herausge-
ber für falsch, diese Stimme innerhalb der Editionen zu 
rekonstruieren. Denn mit Anscombe stimmte von Wright 
damit überein, dass Wittgensteins Schriften möglichst un-
verändert abgedruckt werden sollten. Anders als für Ans-
combe bezog sich das für von Wright jedoch nicht nur auf 
den weitgehend autorisierten Text, sondern auf Wittgen-
steins gesamtes Oeuvre. Für ihn war die Einsicht in die 
Entstehung der Texte ein wesentlicher Zugang beim Ver-
ständnis von Wittgensteins Hauptwerken. Dazu zählte 
nicht nur die Darstellung der Entwicklungsstufen von Witt-
gensteins Werk in den historischen Dokumenten, sondern 
auch die Darstellung des historischen Kontexts. Durch Le-
bensbeschreibung, Herausgabe von Wittgensteins Briefen 
und Erforschung der Entstehungsgeschichten von Witt-
gensteins Werken sollten die Gesprächskontexte erkenn-
bar werden, in denen Wittgensteins Werke entstanden. 
Editorisch kam von Wright so nicht zuletzt zur Veröffentli-
chung der Vermischten Bemerkungen. Diese gehörten 
nicht zu Wittgensteins philosophischen Schriften, sondern 
sollten ein Bild des Mannes als geistige Erscheinung in 
seiner Zeit vermitteln: sie zeigten Wittgenstein wie von 
Wright ihn in Gesprächen über Kultur und Kunst erlebt hat-
te und trugen so zur Kontextualisierung von Wittgensteins 
Philosophie in eine Gesprächslage bei. So trug von Wright 
der Dialogizität von Wittgensteins Philosophieren Rech-
nung; sein eigenes dialogisches Philosophieren mit den 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen war für ihn vornehmlich 
eine private Angelegenheit, wenn auch seine philosophi-
schen Arbeiten deutlich den Stempel der Bekanntschaft 
mit Wittgenstein tragen. 
3. Exegetische, Analytische und Histori-
sche Edierung in zukünftigen Editionen  
Das Medien-Problem des philosophischen Edierens von 
Wittgensteins Nachlass ist ein gutes Beispiel dafür, wie 
Wittgensteins Nachlassverwalter aus ähnlichen Prämissen 
unterschiedliche Editionsmaximen ableiteten (die der an-
deren dabei aber immer schätzten). Man könnte pointiert 
sagen, dass Rhees einen „exegetischen“ Zugang zu Witt-
gensteins Nachlass vertrat, nach dem aus einem internen 
Verständnis heraus ediert werden sollte, Anscombe dage-
gen einen „analytischen“ Zugang, in dem nur die Argu-
mente des autorisierten Textes in einer aktuellen Diskussi-
on zu besprechen waren, und von Wright dagegen einen 
„historischen“ Zugang, in dem der Gedanke über das 
Nachvollziehen seines Werdens aufgeschlossen werden 
kann. Diesen unterschiedlichen Zugängen entsprechen in 
grober Annäherung die Editionsarten einer Ausgabe letzter 
Hand von unvollendeten Werken, der autorisierten Ausga-
be und der historisch kritischen Ausgabe.  
Alle drei Herangehensweisen betonen wichtige Aspekte 
und liefern wertvolle Einsichten in das Werk eines Autors. 
Es ist daher ein glücklicher Umstand, dass der heutige 
Leser anders als die damaligen Herausgeber nicht zwi-
schen diesen Editionsarten entscheiden muss. Es geht

81
vielmehr darum, die Voraussetzungen und Motive der un-
terschiedlichen Editionen transparent zu machen und sie 
so entsprechend ihrer Bedingungen nutzen zu können. Die 
Erforschung der Editionsgeschichte von Wittgensteins 
Nachlass sollte dazu beitragen.  
Auch zukünftige Editionen sind nicht mehr gezwungen, 
zwischen den verschiedenen Editionsarten zu entschei-
den. Durch die Möglichkeiten digitaler Technologien mit 
Aussicht auf eine vollkommene digitale Edition wäre es 
eine unnötige Selbstbeschränkung, einer Trennung von 
Ausgabetypen zu folgen, die in der Analogizität ihrer Her-
stellungsbedingungen begründet liegt. Eine digitale Aus-
gabe könnte die Navigation zwischen verschiedenen Arten 
von Textdarstellung und Kontextinformation ermöglichen, 
so dass die philosophische Unterhaltung mit Wittgensteins 
Texten auf viele Weisen flexibel geführt werden kann. Zu-
künftige Forschung sollte auf Grundlage editionshistori-
scher Erkenntnisse konkrete Konzepte für solche digitale 
Editionen erarbeiten, die mehr sind als eine Projektion der 
gedruckten Ausgaben auf den Bildschirm. Digitale Techno-
logien könnten so wesentlich zur Bewältigung des Medien-
Problems des philosophischen Edierens und vielleicht 
auch zur Bewältigung des Medien-Problems des Philoso-
phierens selbst beitragen.

Josef Schächter’s turn: from the Vienna Circle to Non-Dual 
Religiousness via Wittgenstein 
Rachel Even 
Oranit, Israel | evenr@zahav.net.il 
Abstract 
The philosophy of Josef Schächter, from his membership in the Vienna Circle to his activity in the religious and educational field, 
was in effect influenced by Wittgenstein. Two vectors of influence operated on Schächter: one from the direction of ideas related 
to purifying language of metaphysics with an emphasis on the ethical standing granted to these observations; and the other 
from Wittgenstein's approach to religiousness, which can be extrapolated from his connection with Paul Engelmann. In that, 
Schächter demonstrated two aspects of philosophy: analytical and existentialist. The aggregate vector of what he learned from 
Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle was built into his educational activity and in his approach to the Bible. Schächter's students 
saw him as a mentor, going so far as to establish a community in Kibbutz Yodfat in the Galilee whose members lived according 
to the insights regarding human development, as they had learned them from him. 
 
 
Foreword 
From whence stems the connection between Wittgen-
stein's philosophy and Kibbutz Yodfat in the Galilee? The 
answer is Josef Schächter (1901-1994). He was born to an 
Orthodox Jewish family in Galicia in 1901. He studied in a 
cheder and later at home, and gained a reputation for 
scholarly aptitude already in his youth. In 1921 he moved 
to Vienna where he studied at the Faculty for Philosophy 
of the Inductive Sciences. There he became an assistant 
to Moritz Schlick and a member of the "Vienna Circle." In 
1938 he immigrated to then-Palestine where he met Paul 
Engelmann who had been a close friend of Wittgenstein's 
in the 1920s. The bulk of Engelmann and Wittgenstein's 
conversations dealt with the attributes of religiousness. 
Indeed, in a letter to Engelmann from 1925, Wittgenstein 
responds enthusiastically to the former's intention to go to 
Palestine, saying that it's encouraging news that makes 
him hopeful. He asserts that it's the right thing to do and 
that it may have a spiritual impact, adding that he himself 
might want to join Engelmann. 
 
Schächter and Engelmann spent their entire lives trying 
to fulfill philosophical ideas in daily life. Schächter empha-
sized the practical aspect of philosophy and became a 
teacher and pedagogue. He incorporated into his educa-
tional work some of Wittgenstein's linguistic ideas, both 
early and late, emphasizing the ethical and religious as-
pects. His students saw him as a guide and mentor; even-
tually, in the 1950s, they established Kibbutz Yodfat. In 
their community, they sought to implement a way of life 
based on the philosophical principles that Schächter 
taught them. 
The Vienna Circle 
Schächter joined the Vienna Circle, which sought after sin-
cerity and conceptual clarity. The Circle’s Members dealt 
with elucidating philosophical matters by maintaining a re-
gime of logic in thinking, in rebellion against metaphysical, 
theological and mystical assertions devoid of content. 
Nonetheless, Schächter criticized the Vienna Circle; he 
thought its members saw the act of elucidation as a satis-
fying intellectual game rather than an ethical-religious chal-
lenge, whereas he himself sought to forge a path between 
overcoming the imaginary metaphysical and ignoring the 
real metaphysical: 
I did not want (nor do I want) to revive dead carcasses 
(of superstitions and of the creatures of university 
metaphysics), but on the other hand I did not want to 
ignore the existence of real religious and existential 
elements in thought and in language. (Schächter, 1970, 
pp. 68-69) 
I discovered that the test of meaning, which was a fixed 
asset in this Circle… was not efficacious regarding 
some types of statements… that there are statements 
in human language in which it is evident that the mean-
ing is not dependent on verification… We understand 
these statements, because the understanding of the 
statement consists of finding its place in the fabric of 
language. (Schächter, 1963, p. 9) 
Schächter developed his thinking in regard to layer upon 
layer of language and finding each statement's appropriate 
place within the context of the language already in the 
1930s. These ideas bear no little resemblance to language 
games. 
His criticism of the Circle's intellectualism prompted 
Schächter to look for ways to integrate layers of thought, 
experience and language that do not belong to science but 
exist in overall thought and language. Linguistic separation 
between the scientific field and the religious field was only 
a first step in the act of elucidation. In his opinion, effort 
was required in order to elucidate the dimension of 
thought, experience and language in religion, just as effort 
had been made to elucidate scientific description. Giving 
expression to the inexpressible should not be relinquished 
in advance; rather, the inexpressible should be expressed 
by hints and not statements. 
The Changeover 
When Schächter was asked about his turn from the Vienna 
Circle to religiousness, he replied: 
Almost fifty years ago I thought that the logical elucida-
tion of thought and language is a primary means among 
the ways of correcting humankind… Over the years I 
came to realize that the inner work, of which the Hassi-
dic literature and the literature of the Far East speak, is 
preferable to it… I must note that the clarifications I re-
ceived in the "Vienna Circle" helped me much in my 
studies in religion to separate the wheat from the chaff. 
(Schächter, 1977, pp. 176-177)

According to Schächter, ethics and logic are similar in that 
they include injunctions, and therefore do not belong to the 
sciences that describe processes. The superhuman side of 
the human is revealed not only through the independence 
of logic from psychology, but also through the independ-
ence of ethics from psychology. Schächter sees science 
as a sort of new idolatry. The meaning of life (the reason 
and worthwhileness of life) and the lack of meaning (inner 
emptiness) are the crucial factors in man's inward life 
which is the crux of life, and at this crucial point science 
leaves man to his own devices. 
 
Linguistic Clarity as Ethics 
In Schächter's view, the belief that the act of elucidation is 
valuable is the main thing and not the satisfaction of the 
action. He who seeks conceptual clarity is at a higher sta-
tion than he whose concepts are muddled. In his view, 
there is no external way to grasp or talk about the divine; 
the work has to be internal and to focus on self-
transformation and that showed his belief in the absence 
of consolation. The inexpressible can be pointed or hinted 
at through types of praxis. Practice is accomplished 
through contemplation meant to remove the linguistic error. 
Schächter defines the true philosopher as follows: 
I point to him and say: This one aspires to a philosophi-
cal life, this one doesn't… The dead-end state is not in-
frequent with him, but nonetheless he may attain to an 
actual spiritual station. (Schächter, 1963(1), pp. 45-46) 
In Schächter's view, Wittgenstein was able to distinguish 
by a philosophical essay's style of writing whether the 
writer was a philosopher through and through or merely in 
intellect, and he would therefore reject the writings of phi-
losophers of the second kind. Schächter found Wittgen-
stein to be a source of inspiration because he saw him as 
a true philosopher, because he possessed both acute logi-
cal perception and faith. He remarked that Wittgenstein 
was aware of the existence of what is above man, which 
was not created by man and is not given to expression in 
man's descriptive language: 
Was sich nicht sagen läßt, läßt sich nicht sagen! (Nach-
lass 103, 16r) 
Schächter imposed a logical prohibition on metaphysical 
statements that are not descriptive statements, which was 
supposed to clear the way for true mysticism, i.e., what is 
revealed in the world but does not belong to the descrip-
tion of the world. Engelmann said that Wittgenstein 
erected a fence around a small island in the ocean which 
is the island of science, but he never thought to ascribe too 
much importance to that island or to cast doubt on the ex-
istence of the ocean. 
That discernment was a light unto Schächter, and he 
searched for practices that could help in man's practical 
development. Action expresses and shows the value mani-
fest in it. These practice methods were chosen in order to 
arouse and develop in his students a sensitivity towards 
what cannot be said by directing them to the correct si-
lence. He turned to practices from Hassidism, Buddhism 
and South America, and even embraced the Bible as a 
source for dealing with questions of man's development. 
Schächter's innovation or addition lay in overcoming the 
bad metaphysics and to the same extent overcoming the 
disregard of the real metaphysics. This integration is 
achieved not through discussion, but by means of prac-
tices that hint and point at what lies beyond; especially the 
practice of quieting, because listening to the body helps in 
understanding the soul and separating the psychological 
from the ethical. 
A Method of Clarity 
Schächter devotes a chapter in one of his books to Witt-
genstein. He agrees with Wittgenstein that all contention 
ceases when we come up against the boundaries of lan-
guage. Struggle and achievement find expression in the 
Investigations because the book was written after the 
lapse of certainty, after the sciences ceased to be a mirror 
of reality. The investigations lie on the surface, but Witt-
genstein arrived at the surface only after a long and com-
plicated dive into the depths. Superficial things are discov-
eries that come after years of concentrated thought and 
inward contemplation. Certainty is found to be chained to 
language. This idea is manifest in the Buddhist fable that 
illustrates the way in which he understands Wittgenstein's 
method: 
Before a man studies Zen, to him mountains are moun-
tains and waters are waters; after he gets an insight 
into the truth of  Zen mountains to him are not moun-
tains and waters are not waters; but after this when he 
really attains to the abode of rest, mountains are once 
more mountains and waters are waters. 
The word ‘again’ is important here, because the first sight-
ing is not as the third. And in similar fashion, Wittgenstein 
describes contending with a philosophical problem as fol-
lows: 
Philosophy can be said to consist of three activities: to 
see the commonsense answer, to get yourself so 
deeply into the problem that the commonsense answer 
is unbearable, and to get from that situation back to the 
commonsense answer… One must not in philosophy 
attempt to short-circuit problems. (Wittgenstein, 1979, 
pp. 108-109) 
Schächter implements this method with a logical-
theoretical midrash to the Book of Ecclesiastes. He cites 
the verses "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity" (Ecclesiastes 
1:2) and "And there is no new thing under the sun" (Eccle-
siastes 1:9), arguing that investigating them leads to a 
change in the approach of whoever delves into them in the 
following order: 
The first stage is that of naïve understanding perfect in 
itself… followed by the stage of logical analysis which 
brings out that these pessimistic sentences are merely 
meaningless combinations of words. This is followed by 
a third stage in which we look around for a solution, 
troubled by the incompatibility between the familiarity 
and true-to-life of those sentences and their logical 
meaninglessness. (Schächter, 1994, p. 9) 
On its face, it would appear that we've returned to the 
starting point, but actually we discover that the binary clas-
sification of truth or falsehood cannot be applied to matters 
of value. From this he turns to a more radical argument, 
which he puts in the mouth of the author of Ecclesiastes: 
‘All is pain’ means either: I reject your language con-
taining the pair of concepts ‘pleasure-pain’; or: com-
pared to my unrealizable pleasure, any ordinary pleas-
ure is really pain. (Schächter, 1994, p.17) 
This argument implies a rejection of the binary distinctions 
outside their domain. At the end of the process, the author 
accepts the fact that he is shackled by language, and that 
insight will prevent him from plunging into the abyss.

Non-Dual Religiousness 
In his conversations with Engelmann, Wittgenstein seeks 
liberation from the transcendental chitchat in a place 
where everything is entirely clear and simple. The integra-
tion that Schächter sought to attain is achieved by strictly 
keeping to the linguistic demarcation that prevents duality. 
For that, it is necessary to overcome the desire to talk 
about what is inexpressible, despite the attraction “It is a 
great temptation to try to make the spirit explicit”. (Wittgen-
stein, 1984)  
It is necessary as well to refrain from expressing a skep-
tical or cynical stance regarding what cannot be said. That 
prevents the imposition of a scientific discourse on what 
lies outside the bounds of science. In Wittgenstein words: 
And this is how it is: if only you do not try to utter what 
is unutterable then nothing gets lost. But the unutter-
able will be — unutterably — contained in what has 
been uttered! (Engelmann, 1968, p. 7) 
This avoidance entails effort and is a function of non-dual 
religiousness. The longing for consolation or belief in the 
immortality of the soul is manifested in religion, whereas 
what is prominent in non-duality is the renunciation of the 
longing for consolation. This is expressed by Wittgenstein 
in the Tractatus (§ 6.4312) where he says that even belief 
in the immortality of the soul is unable to accomplish what 
it is expected to. And servility is nothing other than an ex-
pression of superstition. 
As against the customary argument that the religious 
person aspires to quiet and tranquility, Wittgenstein says 
that the religious person should view tranquility as the gift 
of heaven and not something to be pursued (Drury, 1981, 
p. 110). It may be inferred from his remarks that this aspi-
ration does not suit the religious person because he must 
cling to religious belief and observe its injunctions not for 
the sake of accomplishment or receiving anything in return. 
Belief for its own sake is at a higher grade than belief not 
for its own sake and is not its opposite; it has a constitutive 
value in life, and it dictates a way of life. Wittgenstein even 
tells Drury that they must live without the consolation of 
belonging to a certain church, and furthermore “That man 
will be revolutionary who can revolutionize himself”. (Witt-
genstein, 1984) 
Conclusion 
Schächter tirelessly searched and sought to exhaust every 
possible way to help him teach his students the unidirec-
tional way of life. The linguistic expression of non-dual re-
ligiousness is evident in the say-show demarcation. That 
distinction was awarded a binding ethical standing, and it 
expanded the practitioners' ability to distinguish between 
the psychological and the ethical, and to act accordingly: 
the belief is manifest in work on oneself. 
One can see Wittgenstein's deathbed statement, "I’ve 
had a wonderful life," as a distinct expression of the out-
look concerning the absence of consolation. Wittgenstein 
experienced no little emotional and psychological suffering 
in his life. This statement, however, reflects his embrace of 
the linguistic precision that distinguishes between the sci-
entific and the spiritual. It was Schächter who continued to 
develop this distinction into the granting of moral prece-
dence to the life of the spirit that is manifest in mundane 
behavior. In that he overcame the linguistic duality and 
practiced non-dual religiousness.

Instrumentalism: Two different approaches, one epistemic 
optimality argument? 
August Fenk 
Klagenfurt, Austria | August.Fenk@uni-klu.ac.at 
Abstract 
Instrumentalism plays a central role in two opposing epistemological positions, i.e., Radical Constructivism (RC) and Construc-
tive Realism (CR): RC represents instrumentalism as an epistemological position that is consistent with skepticism about the 
external and incompatible with the concept of truth; information theory and cybernetics are adopted for modeling a self-
organizing mind (von Foerster 1972; von Glasersfeld 1998). CR-proponents (Popper 1963; Giere 1985; Kuipers 2000), how-
ever, accept instrumentalism as instrumental methodology but stick to ambitious concepts of truth and the traditional cer-
tainty/uncertainty-dichotomy. The present paper suggests (i) information-theoretic measures of predictive success and progress, 
(ii) a principle of inductive inference that is basic enough to apply even to the extreme case of single event prediction on the ba-
sis of only one observed event, and (iii) the view of the heuristic rationale behind that principle as optimal in (almost) all possible 
worlds. 
 
 
1. Instrumentalism in Constructive Realism 
and Radical Constructivism 
Within instrumentalism, Kuipers (2000) distinguishes in-
strumentalism as an epistemological position from an in-
strumentalist methodology that should be used irrespective 
of the given epistemological position (p. 10f). He suggests 
a transition “from instrumentalism to constructive realism” 
and stresses the fact that the term Constructive Realism 
was already used in Giere (1985), though in somewhat 
different ways: “The difference is that Giere does not take 
truth approximation into account.” (Kuipers 2000:8). 
Giere (1985) emphasizes the true/false dichotomy (cf. 
his Figures 3 and 4) and rejects, for example, the phrase 
of the real system that is “approximately captured by the 
model”: If “we are to have scientific hypotheses which /…/ 
have some reasonable chance of being true, we must 
avoid claims that any real system is exactly captured by 
some model.” (p. 79) He characterizes Constructive Real-
ism as a “decision-theoretic framework” that provides a 
“functional view” (p. 96) of the relation between theory and 
experiment, and as a “model theoretic analogue of the 
view advocated by Grover Maxwell (1962).” 
In his comparison between instrumentalism and realism, 
Maxwell (1962) produces a number of “constructive argu-
ments /…/ for a radically realistic interpretation of theories” 
(p. 3) and the ontological status of theoretical entities. 
Lawlike “sentences tell us, for example, how theoretical 
entities of a given kind resemble, on the one hand, and 
differ from, on the other, the entities with which we happen 
to be more familiar.” (p. 24). But in contrast to the above 
cited authors and to Popper (see below) he attacks instru-
mentalism (as an epistemological position?) without any 
compromise: It “must be acutely embarrassing to instru-
mentalists when what was once a ‘purely’ theoretical entity 
becomes, due to better instruments, etc., an observable 
one.” (p. 22) 
According to Popper (2007), who figures among the pro-
ponents of Constructive Realism (cf. Kuipers 2000), “the 
scientist aims at finding a true theory or description of the 
world” (p. 139), while the instrumentalist rejects that the 
scientist ever could succeed in finally establishing the truth 
of a theory; “for if a theory is an instrument, then it cannot 
be true /…/”. He cites Osiander (‘nobody should expect 
anything certain to emerge from astronomy, for nothing of 
the kind can ever come out of it’) and acknowledges that 
theories are instruments, but offers, as an alternative rea-
son why “there can be no certainty about theories”, that 
our tests can never be exhaustive. (p. 140f)1 The “hypo-
thetical character of a statement – i.e. our uncertainty as to 
the truth – implies that we are making guesses concerning 
reality.” (p. 156). 
We may summarize: Constructive Realism accepts in-
strumentalism as instrumental methodology: A full theory is 
both, an attempt to a description (Popper) or model (Giere; 
Kuipers) of reality, and, at the same time, an instrument 
providing testable predictions. Increased predictive suc-
cess – more hits despite equally precisely formulated pre-
dictions – is the empirical argument for a preliminary ac-
ceptance of the respective assumption.
2  
Radical Constructivism, however, is a variety of episte-
mological instrumentalism (cf. Niemann 2008). Von 
Glasersfeld (1983) explicitly declares his position as corre-
sponding with an instrumentalist epistemology as already 
formulated in Osiander (1627).
3 Osiander’s instrumental-
ism obviously fits the external world skepticism of Radical 
Constructivism much better than mere instrumentalist 
methodology. Von Glasersfeld emphasizes (1998: 507), 
moreover, correspondences between Radical Constructiv-
ism and both, Claude Shannon’s communication theory – 
series of signals attain meaning only through interpreta-
tional processes at both ends of the communication chan-
nel – and Norbert Wiener’s cybernetics which anticipates 
the idea of self-organization. It offers, as shown in von Fo-
erster (1972), the potential for generalizing Humberto 
Maturana’s idea of autopoietic systems. 
Information theory provides, and methods of model se-
lection use, quantitative measures for the growth of knowl-
edge. In terms of information theory, an increasing suc-
cess of guesses – of guesses in Shannon’s guessing 
game technique, or of “highly informative guesses” (Pop-
per) deduced from explicit theories – reflects a measurable 
reduction of uncertainty or gain of redundancy, and an in-
                                                      
1 Some further reasons may concern the methods and conceptual structures 
available at a given time (Oeser 1976: 107, 125f) as well as the relevance of 
testable hypotheses for the theory as a whole.  
2 In terms of Radical Constructivism, where experience rather figures as a 
selective process (Glasersfeld 1983, 1998): Only “viable” and internally consis-
tent concepts survive.  
3 He is reciting Osiander from the first edition of Popper’s “Conjectures” (p. 
98): “There is no need for these hypotheses to be true, or even to be at all like 
the truth; rather, one thing is sufficient for them – that they should yield calcu-
lations which agree with the observations.”

crease of mutual information (=transinformation) between 
guesses and observations concerning certain aspects of a 
certain domain. 
Philosophers, however, tend to maintain the traditional 
certainty/uncertainty dichotomy; recall e.g. von Glasers-
feld’s claim of a principal uncertainty about the external or 
Popper’s claim of a principal uncertainty as to the truth of 
any empirical theory. Both Popper and Kuipers view in-
creasing predictive success as functional for “truth ap-
proximation”. But what is the advantage of the concept of 
truth, if there can be “no certainty about theories” (Popper) 
and no “guarantee that the more successful theory is 
nearer to the truth” (Kuipers 2000: 163), but at best “some 
reasonable chance of being true” (Giere)? On examina-
tion, the concept of truth is neither necessary nor “viable” 
for describing a given status of a certain theory or the evo-
lution of scientific knowledge.  
2. Predictions and oracles 
Predictions require at least one law-like proposition among 
the premises from which they are deduced; but their reli-
ability depends on the quality of the respective law-like 
propositions. But what is a law? Armstrong (1983) distin-
guishes between laws on the one hand and mere regulari-
ties or uniformities on the other. He states that Hume con-
ceived of the relation between cause and effect “as a mere 
regularity” (p. 4), and almost half of Armstrong’s book is a 
critique of a regularity theory of law that mistakes regulari-
ties as laws: If “laws of nature are nothing but Humean 
uniformities, then inductive scepticism is inevitable” (p. 52). 
And: If “everybody in a certain room is wearing a wrist-
watch”, this is a case of a mere uniformity, while laws are 
“genuine relations between universals” (p. 84). Intuitively, 
his point is clear. But could even laws of nature change (cf. 
Lange 2008)? And how to distinguish – in unfamiliar con-
texts, in advance and with “certainty” – between mere 
regularities and universal laws? Whatever the answer is, 
the inductive method applies anyway (see Section 3). 
In his reply to Hume, Reichenbach (1949: 475) claims 
that, “if the aim of scientific method is attainable it will be 
reached by the inductive method” which “can be justified 
as an instrument that realizes the necessary conditions of 
prediction”. But note that Reichenbach’s term “inductive 
method” addresses, more specifically, an asymptotic 
method of inferring to frequency limits. 4 If there is no such 
limit, “we shall certainly not find one – but then all other 
methods will break down also.” Predictions of individual 
events are included as the “special case that the relative 
frequency is =1” (p. 475). Any oracle by prophets or sooth-
sayers would loose its mystical glamour as soon as it is 
subject to a test by his rule of induction. 
Schurz (2008) qualifies Reichenbach’s attempt at a justi-
fication of the inductive method as a wrecked attempt at an 
“optimality justification”: Since “object induction”, i.e., 
methods of induction applied at the level of events, cannot 
be demonstrated as an optimal prediction method, Rei-
chenbach has “failed to establish an optimality argument 
with respect to the goal of predictions.” (p. 281) Schurz 
proposes, instead, a “meta-inductivist” method deriving 
optimal predictions from “the predictions and the observed 
success rates” of other players. But while e.g. “evolution-
ary optimality” addresses optimality in a defined niche 
                                                      
4 Salmon (1966) criticizes Reichenbach’s method of induction by enumeration 
on the grounds of “descriptive simplicity” as “patently inapplicable” (p. 89). But 
computer-simulations by Juhl (1994: 859) attest Reichenbach’s straight rule of 
induction, apart from applicability, at least speed-optimality: “amongst asymp-
totic rules, no other rule gets closer to the truth faster than the straight rule.” 
(Vilarroya 2002), Schurz’s (2008: 280) concept of epis-
temic optimality claims optimality in “all possible worlds”, 
“including all kinds of paranormal worlds in which perfectly 
successful future-tellers /…/ do indeed exist.” (p. 280) The 
major advantage of his method is this “radical openness 
towards all kinds of possibilities” (p. 304), and the goal un-
derlying his optimality argument is maximization of “true 
predictions”, i.e. hits, “and this is clearly an epistemic and 
not a practical goal.” (p. 282). But why not also a practical 
goal? 
Our basic principle of induction (see Section 3) concerns 
the rationality of decisions – decisions even under extreme 
degrees of uncertainty – by each individual cognizer, be he 
a member of a group or an isolated shipwrecked man on 
an island in the Pacific. Cognizers in the plural could, how-
ever, make use of several advantages, such as the appli-
cation of Schurz’s meta-inductivist strategy, or, less so-
phisticated, a calculation of the mean of individual, inde-
pendently produced guesses which tops, due to statistical 
error compensation, in many cases the best one of the 
individual guesses. In both procedures the final overall 
output will benefit from a high prognostic performance of 
single individuals, and in both cases is the calculation of 
the output again a procedure that follows the inductive 
method. 
It is hard to understand why the advantages of both 
these procedures are widely neglected in practical deci-
sions. Take for instance the meta-inductivist strategy: A 
political party that is over years monitoring the prognostic 
performance of different polling institutes before making a 
contract, follows in principle the meta-inductivist strategy 
but would do so more systematically if it maintained that 
monitoring and accounted for the predictions of the com-
peting institutes with calculated weights. An advantage of 
the meta-inductivist strategy beyond this kind of maximiza-
tion of predictive success is, to my view, restricted to 
“paranormal worlds” with “paranormal”, unearthly inspired 
players. 
3. Uniformity and optimality  
To start with the most general point: 
(i) So far there is no argument, neither empirically nor 
logically, for considering that our world is or could turn 
to be non-uniform: 
The evolution of anticipative behavior and of “feed forward” 
information processing in perception as well as in science 
could not have happened in a non-uniform world. Uniform-
ity is a presupposition of induction. But it need not be an 
“all-or-none affair”; nature appears to be uniform to some 
extent and some degree (Salmon 1966: 53). In other 
words: It appears to be redundant, or regular to some de-
gree. Inductive methods are so far – at least to some ex-
tent and some degree – functional; otherwise we have not 
the slightest reason to assume that this might change. 
Thus there is no concrete reason to query either uniformity 
or the functionality of the inductive method for the future. I 
can’t see any circularity in that pattern of argument. But it 
is of course no “reliability” justification of induction. 
 
ii) Induction and prediction is, in principle, an intuitive or 
explicit calculation of (changes of) relative frequencies 
and their extrapolation to the future. (We have no other 
choice – with the exception of irrational decisions, such 
as the “gambler’s fallacy”.)  

Instrumentalism: Two different approaches, one epistemic optimality argument? | August Fenk 
 
 
 
87
This principle of induction is basic enough to apply to a 
prediction even of an individual event on the basis of noth-
ing else but one individual observed instance (Fenk 2008: 
90), in which case the best wager relative to what we know 
is that the future instance would be similar to the observed 
one. Let me illustrate this building on Armstrong’s example 
of a mere regularity: From 101 persons in a certain room 
those 100 persons “tested” so far are wearing a wristwatch 
(relative frequency = 1). What would be our guess con-
cerning the last person X if we had to guess in the ab-
sence of any additional knowledge? The usual generaliza-
tion of relative frequencies suggests that the probability for 
X to wear a wristwatch is higher than to wear e.g. a pock-
etwatch or no watch at all. A consequent application of that 
generalization amounts to the same guess (“wristwatch!”) 
for a yet unknown instance even in the case of the small-
est possible “sample-size” of only one person “tested” so 
far (observed relative frequency of wearing a wristwatch = 
1) or the slightest overhang (from the 100 persons “tested” 
so far, only 51 are wearing a wristwatch; relative frequency 
= .51). 
(iii) Since a justification of induction is not possible and 
heuristic strategies cannot claim to be “true”, it is tempt-
ing to search at least for optimality arguments. 
The rationale behind any kind of instrumentalism can be 
viewed as a fundamental epistemic optimality argument. 
The respective maxime reads as follows: Never give up 
the assumption of uniformity! Anything else would be a 
premature decision for the following reasons:  
 The presupposition of inductive uniformity is, of 
course, appropriate in every (to some extent and 
some degree) uniform world.  
 In a world, where even “true” laws of nature could 
change, it is the only assumption that would allow 
identifying, first of all, the change as such, and more-
over possible reasons and “meta-“ or “higher-order” 
laws responsible for that change. (Which means, at 
the same time, that the inductive uniformity assump-
tion could be maintained despite changing laws of na-
ture.) 
 And in a world without any “uniformity” or redun-
dancy, our maxime is again optimal – no worse than 
any other heuristic principle, if or as long as this world 
remains in this state, but the only principle that would 
allow recognizing a possible turn or return to uniform-
ity. 
 Note: The fictional cognitive subject that could live in 
that fictional totally non-uniform world could never de-
cide whether his breakdown in predictive perform-
ance is his or the world’s fault; a proof of regularity is, 
with some reservation, possible, a proof of random-
ness is not. 
 
To summarize: Universal applicability of a heuristic princi-
ple implies a minimum of restrictions. Our epistemic opti-
mality argument applies irrespective of (a) the size of the 
sample from which the inferences are drawn and (b) the 
availability of any additional contextual knowledge or any 
knowledge about predictions of possible other players, and 
irrespective of whether one presupposes (c) an inductively 
uniform or non-uniform world, or something in between, or 
(d) “true” laws or mere uniformities, and if laws, irrespec-
tive of the question of whether they could change or not.

Perspicuous Representation and Perspicuity 
Tom Fery 
Vienna, Austria | tom.fery@univie.ac.at  
Abstract 
'Perspicuity' is of central importance in the works of the late Wittgenstein. Remarks such as "A main source of our failure to un-
derstand is that we do not command a clear view of the use of our words. [...] Hence the importance of finding and inventing 
intermediate cases." (PI 122) speak a clear language. A lot of work has been done by interpreters on remarks like this one. In 
his remarks on the foundations of mathematics 'perspicuity' is a central concept as well, e.g. in RFM III, 1: "Mathematical proof 
must be perspicuous." I will discuss whether the notion of perspicuous representation as a guidance of philosophical method 
and perspicuity as a condition of a proof are connected to each other. A closer look on Wittgenstein's remarks on Cantor will be 
helpful in this respect. 
 
 
1. Perspicuous representation and perspi-
cuity  
The role of the concept of 'perspicuity' in Wittgensteins 
later works is eminently important and has been consid-
ered as such by any commentator in the field. The perhaps 
most evident indicator for its role can be found in PI, 122: 
A main source of our failure to understand is that we do 
not command a clear view of the use of our words. – Our 
grammar is lacking in this sort of perspicuity. – A perspicu-
ous representation produces just that understanding which 
consists in 'seeing connexions'. Hence the importance of 
finding and inventing intermediate cases. The concept of a 
perspicuous representation is of fundamental significance 
for us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the way we 
look at things. (Is this a 'Weltanschauung'?) (PI, 122) 
Surely a lot of interpretational work can be done here 
and indeed has already been done. One open question is 
whether this idea of perspicuous representation is con-
nected to Wittgenstein's condition of perspicuity of a 
mathematical proof.  
A controversially discussed remark on the foundations of 
mathematics can be found in the opening remarks of RFM 
III: 
'A mathematical proof must be perspicuous.' Only a 
structure whose reproduction is an easy task is called a 
"proof". It must be possible to decide with certainty 
whether we really have the same proof twice over, or 
not. The proof must be a configuration whose exact re-
production can be certain. Or again: we must be sure 
we can exactly 
reproduce what is essential to the proof. It may for exam-
ple be written down in two different handwritings or col-
ours. What goes to make the reproduction of a proof is not 
anything like an exact reproduction of a shade of colour or 
a hand-writing. (RFM III, 1) 
It is tempting to associate the abovementioned concept 
of giving a perspicuous representation as the right thing to 
do for a philosopher with this idea of a mathematical proof 
being perspicuous. Since  giving perspicuous representa-
tions is the overall goal in his philosophy and now he is 
now applying this concept to his philosophy of mathemat-
ics we can assume to be a close connection here.  
One proponent of the view is Stefan Majetschak (Majet-
schak 2013,10). When Wittgenstein speaks of perspicuity 
in mathematics, he means that there is a visual surveyabil-
ity of all the relevant items of a proof.  As a support for this 
view, Majetschak cites an example of a mathematical 
proof1 of 3 > 2: 
  
                    (ibid., 11)  
According to Majetschak the key aspect Wittgenstein is 
pointing out is the visual grasp one has by looking at that 
proof. And only through this visual grasp is it an easy task 
to reproduce the proof.  
But there are also reasons to disconnect both occur-
rences of that term. Felix Mühlhölzer (Mühlhölzer 2010) 
presents a very detailed comment on part III of RFM
2 while 
putting much work on an interpretation of the role of per-
spicuity in a mathematical proof. First of all perspicuity as a 
condition of a proof must not be understood in the way that 
a mathematical proof "can be taken in at a glance" as Mark 
Steiner originally proposed (cf. Steiner 1975, 41). Majet-
schak also seems to build on this aspect fo perspicuity. 
Everyone who was once confronted with a mathematical 
proof can see that this kind of demand is severely at odds 
with mathematical practice (cf. Mühlhölzer 2010, 92). And 
since Wittgenstein was intimately acquainted with mathe-
matical practice, that kind of perceptual perspicuity as pro-
posed by Steiner simply cannot do justice to the above-
mentioned remark.  
It is helpful to contrast a mathematical proof with an ex-
periment in physics, say. The important difference is that in 
a proof everything relevant to it is written on paper, 
whereas in an experiment additional assumptions have to 
be made. In RFM IV we read: 
When I wrote "proof must be perspicuous" that meant: 
causality plays no part in the proof.  
Or again: a proof must be capable of being reproduced 
by mere copying. (RFM IV, 41) 
So in the sense that in a proof there are no such things as 
causality, a proof has to be perspicuous. Given this we can 
understand what Wittgenstein has in mind when talking 
about the difficulty of identifying patterns such "1 +1 + 1 +1 
+1 + 1 + 1" and "1 +1 + 1 +1 +1 + 1 + 1" (an example Witt-
                                                      
1 Examples like this one are indeed called proofs by Wittgenstein. This usage 
clearly differs from a more rigorous usage of the term proof employed by 
mathematicians. It can be seen as one of many sources of the troubles of 
getting a clear picture of his philosophy of mathematics.   
2 In fact his comment is concerned with all parts of the Nachlass which are 
relevant for RFM III. The editors have unfortunately omitted some pieces that 
are very important for the readers’ understanding of MS 122 and MS 117.

genstein uses in (BT, p. 580). In that way it is important to 
see the proof as a pattern of which a  reproduction of its 
relevant aspects is an easy task. But since even in exam-
ples like these ones the risk of a simple miscounting is 
quite high.
3  
So there are good reasons to treat perspicuity in a proof 
as distinct from perspicuous representation as a philoso-
phical method.  
2. Revisionism vs. Non-Revisionism 
There is quite a debate over the question what Wittgen-
stein actually intended with his remarks on mathematical 
practice. One can broadly divide the opinions on that ques-
tion into two camps: the revisionist camp and the non-
revisionist camp. As its name implies, revisionism holds 
the view that Wittgenstein actually criticized mathematical 
practice and aimed at changing it. Non-revisionism on the 
other hand is the view that such an aim could not be his 
target and that his remarks are only to be understood as 
criticizing some colloquial way of speaking about mathe-
matics. There are good reasons for each view. The per-
haps most straightforward reason for non-revisionism can 
be found in his lectures on the foundations of mathemat-
ics. 
It will be most important not to interfere with the 
mathematicians. I must not make a calculation and say, 
"That's the result; not what Turing says it is." Suppose it 
ever did happen – it would have nothing to do with the 
foundation. (LFM I, 13) 
These lectures were given in 1939. Wittgenstein is claim-
ing that it is of greatest importance not to interfere with the 
mathematicians. Given this, one might wonder why anyone 
thinks that Wittgenstein can be seen as a revisionist after 
all. A popular way to argue for revisionism is by citing RFM 
II. These remarks are concerned with Georg Cantor's di-
agonal argument.  
2.1 Cantor's proof  
Suppose, the set of ℝ  between 0 and 1 is denumerable. In 
that case we should be able to construct a list in which 
every real number between 0 and 1 occurs at some time. 
The list would look something like the following: 
 
  0.1398421..... 
  0.7222439.....  
  0.5000000.... 
  0.4444444... 
  ......... 
No we construct a real number r via picking out each n-th 
digit behind the point from the n-th line: 
 
  0.1398421..... 
  0.7222439.....  
  0.5000000.... 
  0.4444444... 
  ......... 
The number we obtain is therefore the number r = 
0.1204.... Now we construct a new number out of r in 
                                                      
3 Considerations of this form are one of the reasons for Wittgenstein to deny 
the possibility of (logical) foundations of arithmetic. 
which each digit is replaced for another one. This new 
number cannot be included in the list. It cannot be in the n-
th line since it was construed in a way that each of its n-th 
digit is different from the digit in the n-th line. So the set ℝ  
(between 0 and 1) is greater than the set ℕ. The set is 
non-denumarably infinite. 
In RFM II Wittgenstein writes: 
Our suspicion ought always to be aroused when a proof 
proves more than its means allow it. Something of this 
sort might be called 'a puff. (RFM II, 21) 
This was written in 1938 – only a year before the LFM. So, 
the remarks just presented somehow have to be made 
compatible with Wittgenstein's non-revisionist statements 
in his lectures. 
Clearly he feels that something is going wrong about 
Cantor's proof. So how do these remarks fit to his asser-
tions made just a year later " it will be most important not 
to interfere with the mathematicians" (LFM I, 13)?  
One interpretation is to take Wittgenstein's non-
revisionist advice serious and doubt whether his remarks 
on Cantor aim to revise mathematics. This view is de-
fended by C. Wright (1980) and P. Maddy (1993). One 
specific and vivid way to do this is by referring to a distinc-
tion Wittgenstein made, most famously in conversation 
with Friedrich Waismann. The distinction between calculus 
and prose. The idea then is that Wittgenstein is not criticis-
ing the proof as such, or not its technical core. The only 
things he is criticizing are associations we have by describ-
ing some of its results in terms of ordinary language. To 
say that one infinite set is greater than another infinite set 
is inappropriate. Only countable sets can be greater than 
other countable sets. The adoption ofte term "greater than" 
a result of the confusion about the "prosaic" part of Can-
tor's proof.  
So, these considerations suggest a picture of the follow-
ing sort: mathematics with its formulas and equations is 
best left to mathematics. But when they go beyond their 
formulas and speak about their results in normal language, 
then it is the philosopher's job to eventually put a stop to all 
this.  
The role perspicuity plays in Cantor's proof is everything 
but obvious. If Wittgenstein accepts the calculus part of the 
proof, then this part has to be perspicuous. That he ac-
cepted this part was suggested above; remarks as the fol-
lowing are additionally pointing in that direction: 
What I am doing is, not to shew that calculations are 
wrong, but to subject the interest of calculations to a 
test. I test e.g. the justification for still using the word ... 
here. [...]Thus I must say, not: "We must not express 
ourselves like this" [...] but: "Test the justification of this 
expression in this way". You cannot survey the justifica-
tion of an expression unless you survey its employ-
ment; which you cannot do by looking at some facet of 
its employment, say a picture attaching to it. (RFM II, 
62) 
Two things are to be noted here. First, he claims that he 
doesn't call the calculation of current interest wrong. He is 
only pointing towards some particular uses of expressions. 
The second thing to notice is his reason for seeing a prob-
lem with the use of the justification of problematic expres-
sions (in this case the expression is infinity). That is the 
unsurveyability of its usage. It is only one aspect of its us-
age that erroneously imposes on us while thinking and 
speaking about the diagonal argument. In other words, 
only if the usage of a concept one is using to speak about

a perspicuous calculation and its result is itself surveyable 
to a sufficient degree, then is one justified in applying that 
concept to the calculus. And since concepts as "greater 
than" or "infinity" are used in a completely new way in this 
situation, their application is inappropriate. 
In my eyes, a reading as the one just presented is the 
most promising one. It is the only one that takes Wittgen-
stein's explicitly non-revisionist announcements serious 
and draws a coherent picture of a bulk of his remarks on 
mathematics. And as a side effect, it is a first step of bridg-
ing the concepts of perspicuous representation as a phi-
losophical method and perspicuity as a condition for a 
mathematical proof in a promising way.  
All the merits of such a reading notwithstanding, there 
still are a whole range of problems to deal with. First of all 
the picture of mathematics as something purely computa-
tional and non-conceptual can't be adopted without closer 
examination. A lot of the work of mathematicians is of 
course not just calculating but also e.g. defining concepts. 
Indeed Wittgenstein was very well aware of that. For in-
stance in RFM III we read "The proof creates a new con-
cept by creating or being a new sign. Or – by giving the 
proposition which is its result a new place. (For the proof is 
not a movement but a route.)" (RFM III, 41).  
I have argued that only concepts whose usages are suf-
ficiently perspicuous to us are legitimate candidates for 
application to mathematical results. This seems to be at 
odds with the idea that a "proof creates a new concept". 
Therefore, the relations which hold between concepts and 
proof have to be understood in a way which fits our inter-
pretation. A way of doing that would be to find a threshold 
for the legitimacy of the application of ordinary concepts to 
calculi.

The mind’s intentionalities 
Luis Flores 
Santiago, Chile | lfloresh@uc.cl  
Abstract 
Husserl’s and Wittgenstein’s approaches about mind are, to a certain extent, premises of my proposal. For Husserl, mind is 
conciousness, a network of acts. Every act is intentional, temporal, has horizon and comes from somebody. Lived body is the 
hinge between mind and physical body.  It is inserted in life-world. For Wittgenstein, mind becomes off-center in favour of praxis. 
Natural languages are social. According to a grammar of experiences, we have to understand the language-game in which we 
talk about mind. I understand mind as conciousness. This one is immediate and directed to something. My first claim is that it is 
ontologically original, because: it is only temporal; experiences have not spatial foreshortenings; it is bounded only by motiva-
tion; experiences have fuzzy borders; it is essentially multiple, excluded the I. Consequently, my second claim is that there are 
four intentionalities of mind, isomorphical with lived body’s intentionalities: cognitive, symptomatic, deontic and aesthetic. 
 
 
1. Husserl’s approach 
Husserl uses the terms ‘Seele’, ‘Geist’, ‘das Psychische’, 
‘das Seelische’, but also to a great extent uses the term 
‘Bewusstsein’ (consciousness).  Thus, mind is considered 
at least as consciousness, as a network of acts or experi-
ences (Erlebnisse). It is not conceived as a Cartesian res 
cogitans.  
Its properties are: 1) Intentionality— direction(Richtung) 
towards an object—. This idea comes from Franz Bren-
tano: “Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what 
the Scholastics of the Middles Ages called the intentional 
(or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might 
call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a con-
tent, direction towards an object” (Brentano 1995, 88). In-
tentionality has nothing to do with intention or purpose 
(Absicht).  The mind concerns especially experiences and 
these are intentional. They mean something and conse-
quently there is biunivocally something thought, desired, 
imagined, willed, and so on. Notwithstanding, the mind 
also concerns sensations. These are not intentional. They 
constitute the downstairs of consciousness. 
2) Temporality. Consciousness is always flowing. For 
Husserl, the kingdom of consciousness phenomena 
agrees with the Heraclitean river: “We move in the field of 
pure phenomena. But why do I say field?  It is more nearly 
a Heraclitean flux of phenomena.” (Husserl 1964, 37).  As 
Moran and Cohen remark correctly:  “For Husserl, time is 
at the very basis of consciousness and his analyses of the 
a priori structures of time-consciousness are among his 
deepest, most difficult and also most influential writings.” 
(Moran and Cohen 2012, 322).   Husserl distinguishes 
minimally between objective time and phenomenological 
time. The first one is concerned with chronometry and 
physics. The second one concerns the original structure of 
temporality, insofar as perception, retention and protention 
concern the present, the immediate past and the immedi-
ate future.  Accordingly, the mind is not spatial, but essen-
tially temporal: there is no container and no content.  The 
mind is neither a black box, nor a white box, because it is 
not a box: “It becomes clear that in the Cartesian sphere 
itself different types of objectivity are ‘constituted’.  And to 
say that they are constituted implies that immanent data 
are not, as at first seemed, simply in consciousness in the 
sense in which things are in a box, but that all the time 
they are displayed in something like ‘appearances’. These 
appearances neither are nor genuinely contain the objects 
themselves.”(Husserl 1964, 56). Gallagher and Zahavi 
conclude that phenomenological accounts of the mind-
world relation “are not easily captured and categorized as 
being either internalist or externalist in nature.”(Gallagher 
and Zahavi 2012,143).   
3) Having horizon. This means the background (Hinter-
grund) where experience is inserted. There are no isolated 
experiences, because there are always overlappings and 
different planes. Husserl’s approach is systemic.  Our mind 
is not a lot of experiences without relation among them-
selves, considered merely as watertight compartments.  
There are experiences in the first plane and also in the 
background.  Insofar as an experience has a horizon, the 
mind is not reduced to the focusing of attention. There are 
always experiences in the surroundings, on the quiet, that 
are not explicit, but in a certain way they are experienced.   
4) Every experience comes from somebody or someone. 
Neither is there experience about nothing, nor is there ex-
perience of nobody or not one. For Husserl, the I or the 
intersubjectivity is always implied as a pole of experiences. 
Gallager and Zahavi remark: “Phenomenologists are pri-
marily interested in intentionality as a decisive feature of 
consciousness. Moreover, they specifically focus on an 
account of intentionality from the first-person perspective, 
that is, from the subject’s point of view.” (Gallagher and 
Zahavi 2012, 127).    
In conclusion, every experience is intentional, it is tem-
poral, it has a horizon, and it is of somebody. 
Furthermore, consciousness has to be understood tran-
scendentally, insofar as it is necessary to reach  the a pri-
ori of our experiences and of their correlates, putting exis-
tence (Dasein) into brackets.  
Finally, concerning the link with the world, the lived body 
(Leib) arises in contrast with the physical body (Körper).  It 
is the hinge between the mind and the physical body.  It is 
inserted in the life-world (Lebenswelt). 
2. Wittgenstein’s approach 
Wittgenstein does not deny mental states —“And now it 
looks  as if we had denied mental processes. And naturally 
we don’t want to deny them.” (Wittgenstein 1958, 
§308,103e)—, but the mind becomes off-center in favour 
of praxis. Wittgenstein rejects both mentalism and behav-
iorism. Concerning this, he keeps one’s distance: “ ‘Are 
you not really a behaviourist in disguise?  Aren’t you at 
bottom really saying that everything except human behav-
iour is a fiction? — If I do speak of a fiction, then it is of a 
grammatical fiction.” (Wittgenstein 1958, §307, 102e-103e).

Natural languages are not private, but social.  Accord-
ingly, the way of language is a key: “I become corroded by 
remorse” must be understood according to a grammar of 
experiences — “Now the danger we are in when we adopt 
the sense datum notation is to forget the difference be-
tween the grammar of a statement about sense data and 
the grammar of an outwardly similar statement about 
physical objects.”(Wittgenstein 1960, 70)—. We have to 
understand the corresponding language-game when we 
talk about mind: for instance, to come to mind.  And what 
is a language–game?  A language-game can be a simpli-
fied language: “a primitive language” (Wittgenstein 1958, 
§7, 5e).   A second sense concerns the following definition: 
“I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the 
actions into which it is woven, the language-game” (Witt-
genstein 1958, §7, 5e).  And finally, Wittgenstein links lan-
guage-game with form of life (Lebensform): “Here the term 
‘language-game’ is meant to bring into prominence the fact 
that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a 
form of life.”(Wittgenstein 1958, §23, 11e).  It is important 
to take account of the inseparability of mind and language-
games.  Let us consider what Ashok Vohra says: “I have 
supported Wittgenstein’s view that the relation between 
words and physical phenomena is not contingent, but es-
sential, and that language is not the product of one person, 
but has evolved with human life” (Vohra 1986, 5-6). 
3. Ontological irreducibility of the mind  
I understand “mind” as consciousness, which is insepara-
ble from the lived body. Consciousness is always directed 
to something (directedness, aboutness), it is a flowing of 
irruptions or occurrences. 
Concerning my first claim, the mind as consciousness is 
an  irreducible ontological level.  The first argument is that 
the mind has to do only with time.  Spatial considerations 
like “what’s the big idea?” are only metaphorical. One idea 
is not bigger than another one. A second argument is that 
physical things can be perceived only by adumbrations or 
foreshortenings (Abschattungen). Gallagher and Zahavi 
point out: “One is not simply conscious of an object, one is 
always conscious of an object in a particular way.  One 
always has a certain perspective or point of view on the 
object; the object is always presented in a certain way or 
under a certain aspect for the subject.”(Gallagher and Za-
havi 2012, 131).  Concerning intentionality, Searle recog-
nizes: “My conscious experiences, unlike the objects of 
experience, are always perspectival. They are always from 
a point of view. […] Noticing the perspectival character of 
conscious experience is a good way to remind ourselves 
that all intentionality is aspectual. […] Every intentional 
state has what I call an aspectual shape.” (Searle 1998, 
131).  In turn, experiences have no spatial foreshortenings, 
because they have not sides. They are grasped totally, 
except concerning temporal foreshortenings. These con-
cern the past (memories), the present (perceptions) and 
the future (expectations). A third argument is that the 
stream of consciousness is not causally bounded like neu-
ronal synapses, but only by motivation, that is to say, by 
sense or meaning connections.  A fourth argument is that 
experiences have no exact limits, but fuzzy borders, over-
laps, fringes (W. James).  Mathematical concepts of neu-
roscience and cognitive science are exact, even though 
phenomena or experiences are fuzzy.  We need morpho-
logical concepts (Husserl), or vague concepts (Wittgen-
stein).  A fifth argument has to do with multiplicity of mind.  
Physical things are ordinarily stable according to their 
laws.  Because the mind is immediately linked with our 
multiform praxis in the world, then it has an essential mul-
tiplicity, excluding the I. The mind is a complex and plastic 
network of intentionalities, because of its changing planes.   
4. The mind’s multiplicity  
Concerning my second claim, there is no homogenous 
mind: it is a question of mind’s intentionalities.  There is no 
neutral mind or mind zero. There is always a disposition to 
know, or to express our mental states, or to act over the 
world, or to consider aesthetically the world or our mind. 
Consequently, I distinguish four intentionalities of the mind:  
Firstly, there is cognitive or representative intentionality, 
insofar as the mind is concerned with a mimesis of the 
world. This orientation has been specially privileged by 
cognitive science and neuroscience. The goal is truth 
about reality, by means of representations. Knowledge 
takes place at present. For instance, when I say “I get it”.  
Truth becomes the telos of propositions. This one is guar-
anteed by evidence, insofar as we can fulfill the mere pro-
positional meaning with intuitions, not only empirical, but 
categorial. 
Secondly, there is deontic or conative intentionality, inso-
far as mind is a conation (conatus) about the world and 
also about our frames of mind. This conation can be about 
my own mind or about other minds, when my mind inter-
pellates them. My mind is focused on action, gets into ac-
tion. Wishful thinking appears, then the world appears as 
transformable, changeable.  The world becomes a network 
of goals. It is time to make up one’s mind. Afterwards, my 
mind becomes strong-minded. The chain of motifs is in 
search of new accomplishments, achievements, realiza-
tions or performances. The telos is the good, or simply the 
good life. It can be also the search for usefulness: see the 
technic. 
Thirdly, there is symptomatic or expressive intentionality, 
insofar as the mind is indication, trace, or clue of other 
strata of consciousness, our personal history, or our cul-
tural context. The mind appears as an index or expression 
of the self with its history. Briefly, the mind’s past ist re-
vealed.  One can consider the role of oneiric images: they 
can be a signal of our anguish with regard to the forthcom-
ing future.  Here the telos is the aletheia, in the Greek 
sense of revelation, but concerning the self. We have to 
deal with the self-revelation: it is the authenticity of verac-
ity. 
Fourthly, there is aesthetic intentionality, insofar as our 
mind intends or stresses the beauty of a landscape, 
whether inner or outer. Also, when we live our mind as an 
aesthetic flowing, or when we are searching for the eu-
rythmy of our thoughts. Our mind wanders, rambles or dis-
gresses in its own labyrinth: the equivalent is what in 
French is called “flâner”.  In this case, the mind is not ade-
quate to reality, but to some architectural criteria as sym-
metry, harmony, simplicity. The telos is here the beauty of 
our thoughts. Accordingly, we need an aesthetics of mind.   
5. Isomorphism between the mind’s inten-
tionalities and lived body’s intentionali-
ties 
To be minded is at all times to be disposed to anything. 
We can be scientifically-minded, or strong-minded with 
respect to a transformation of our surroundings, or to be 
absent-minded, or to be aesthetically minded in the search 
of beauty. The point is that here there is not the Cartesian 
separation between two substances. We live unanimously

our mind and our corporality. Therefore, there are isomor-
phically four lived body’s intentionalities. The first one con-
cerns my body’s disposition to know about the world: for 
instance, to touch a cup to evaluate its temperature, “to 
devour someone with one’s gaze”, or “to be all ears”.  The 
second one is to live deontically your body in active dispo-
sition, for instance, to catch a bug which is annoying us.  
The third one is to live symptomatically my body with ges-
tures and mime in order to express my mental states: im-
patience, tedium, and so on. The fourth one is to live aes-
thetically my body: for example, I can walk with elegance 
or dash. 
All the variations of my lived body have consequences in 
other minds, insofar as these are not mere minds, but em-
bodied minds. If I am ashamed to do something, it is not a 
question of private mental states. Consequently, I also feel 
my beating heart, I feel my blush insofar as I feel the blood 
heat on my face. For other minds, the colour of my face, of 
my cheeks, is not merely a colour—for instance, like of a 
daubed face—, but it is a matter of the symptomatic colour 
of a countenance. Then other minds can read immediately 
my shame.

Sprachliche Zwecke und der Zweck der Sprache 
Florian Franken 
München, Deutschland | florian.franken@gmx.de 
Abstract 
Der Gebrauchscharakter der Sprache, der mit Wittgensteins Sichtweise auf das Wesen der Sprache verbunden ist, ruft Fragen 
hinsichtlich des Zwecks und des Gegenstands des Gebrauchs hervor. Wittgenstein legt sich diesbezüglich in den 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen und darüber hinaus nicht eindeutig fest. Ich möchte deshalb untersuchen, was darunter zu 
verstehen ist, dass (I) mit einzelnen sprachlichen Einheiten und (II) mit einer Sprache insgesamt ein Zweck verbunden ist. 
Daraus wird sich der Schluss ziehen lassen, dass mit dem Bezug auf unterschiedliche Gegenstände des Gebrauchs auch 
unterschiedliche Zweckbegriffe in Anschlag gebracht werden, die in der Wittgenstein-Rezeption indes häufig miteinander 
verwechselt werden. 
 
 
Bekanntlich behauptet Wittgenstein in den Philosophi-
schen Untersuchungen, man könne in vielen Fällen, in de-
nen man von der »Bedeutung« eines Wortes spricht, die 
Rede von Bedeutung so verstehen, dass sie der Gebrauch 
in der Sprache ist. Die Sichtweise auf Sprache, die mit 
dieser Behauptung angedeutet wird, ruft Fragen hinsicht-
lich eines näheren Verständnisses des Gebrauchscharak-
ters hervor. Ich möchte im Folgenden den Blick insbeson-
dere auf zwei Fragen richten. Zum einen lässt sich in Be-
zug auf den Gebrauch nach der teleologischen Ausrich-
tung fragen. Welcher Zweck wird mit dem Gebrauch ver-
folgt? Wozu dient der Gegenstand in seinem Gebrauch? 
Zum anderen lässt sich nach dem Gegenstand selbst fra-
gen, dessen Gebrauchscharakter behauptet wird. Welches 
ist der Gegenstand, mit dem ein Zweck verfolgt wird? Sind 
mit den Gegenständen sprachliche Einheiten, wie z.B. 
Wörter oder Sätze gemeint? Oder ist gemeint, dass eine 
Sprache als Ganzes einen Zweck erfüllt?  
Wittgenstein legt sich in seiner Sicht auf den zweckerfül-
lenden Gegenstand nicht eindeutig fest. In einigen Bemer-
kungen liegt der Fokus auf dem Zweck von Wörtern und 
Sätzen, in anderen Bemerkungen wiederum bezieht er 
den Zweck der Sprache auf die Sprache als Ganzes. Ich 
möchte deshalb untersuchen, was genau in Folge der Be-
hauptung vom Gebrauchscharakter der Sprache darunter 
zu verstehen ist, dass (I) mit einzelnen sprachlichen Ein-
heiten und (II) mit einer Sprache insgesamt ein Zweck ver-
bunden ist. Daraus wird sich der Schluss ziehen lassen, 
dass mit dem Bezug auf unterschiedliche Gegenstände 
des Gebrauchs auch unterschiedliche Zweckbegriffe in 
Anschlag gebracht werden, die in der Wittgenstein-
Rezeption indes häufig miteinander verwechselt werden.  
I 
Zu Beginn der Philosophischen Untersuchungen erläutert 
Wittgenstein den Zweck einer Sprache anhand einer bei-
spielhaften Interaktion zwischen einem Bauenden und sei-
nem Gehilfen (PU 2009: 2). Dabei ist zu beachten, dass 
die Interaktion laut Wittgenstein als eine »vollständig primi-
tive Sprache« aufzufassen ist. Sie besteht aus den vier 
Wörtern »Würfel«, »Säule«, »Platte«, »Balken«, mit deren 
Ausruf durch den Bauenden der Zweck verbunden ist, 
dass der Gehilfe einen bestimmten Gegenstand bringt. 
Sprache wird in diesem Beispiel als Verständigungssystem 
verstanden, dessen Zweck darin besteht, mit dem Ausruf 
jedes einzelnen Wortes ein bestimmtes Verhalten des Ge-
hilfen hervorzurufen und auf diese Weise Gegenstände zu 
bezeichnen. Obwohl wir uns demzufolge ein Verständi-
gungssystem vorstellen können, indem Wörter den Zweck 
erfüllen Gegenstände zu bezeichnen, bemerkt Wittgen-
stein, dass dieses System nicht alles umfasst, was wir 
Sprache nennen, und daher sollte der mit ihm verfolgte 
Zweck demzufolge nicht mit dem Zweck der Sprache 
gleichgesetzt werden. Ein bestimmter Zweck kann anhand 
primitiver Formen der Sprachverwendung klar übersehen 
werden, allerdings lässt man sich damit auch auf eine ver-
engte Sichtweise ein. Mit ihr ist die Gefahr des Irrtums 
verbunden, dass der Zweck der Sprache allein in der Be-
zeichnung von Gegenständen bestünde. Wenn indes das 
Bezeichnen im Gebrauch der Wörter vollzogen wird, dann 
können Wörter je nach dem gewünschten Zweck eine 
ganz unterschiedliche Verwendung finden. Mit einigen be-
ziehen wir uns auf Zahlen, mit anderen auf Farben, und 
mit wieder anderen weisen wir auf Orte hin1. Dementspre-
chend wäre es zwar möglich, die Wörter ihrem Gebrauch 
gemäß danach einzuteilen, was sie bezeichnen, um auf 
diese Weise zu versuchen, bestimmte Zwecke universal 
zu bestimmen. Doch eine solche Einteilung stünde nicht 
absolut dar, sondern würde in Abhängigkeit zum Zweck 
der einzelnen Wörter sowie zum Zweck der Einteilung 
selbst vorübergehend fixiert werden müssen und daher 
keine universale Bestimmung zulassen.   
Ähnliches lässt sich über Sätze sagen, die auf den ers-
ten Blick unzweifelhaft den gleichen Zweck verfolgen. Es 
scheint zunächst offensichtlich, dass die mit den beiden 
Sätzen »Bring mir den Besen!« und »Bring mir den Be-
senstil und die Bürste, die in ihm steckt!« ausgedrückten 
Befehle mit dem gleichen Zweck verbunden sind. Auf den 
zweiten Blick zeigt sich jedoch, dass mit den Befehlen 
durchaus kein von vornherein festgelegter Zweck (Witt-
genstein spricht an dieser Stelle auch vom »Witz« des Be-
fehls) verbunden ist. Man könnte annehmen, dass der 
gleiche Zweck erfüllt wird, wenn auf beide Befehle hin die 
gleiche Handlung ausgeführt wird. Doch die Kriterien, mit 
denen die Gleichheit der Handlungen festzulegen ist, hän-
gen von dem Zweck der Handlung ab, nicht umgekehrt 
(vgl. dazu Baker / Hacker 2005, S. 142). Was indes als 
Zweck des Befehls anzusehen ist, ist nicht ohne weiteres 
klar und hängt durchaus vom Kontext der einzelnen Situa-
tion ab2. Man könnte annehmen, dass das Wesentliche 
                                                      
1 In PU 2009: 6 zieht Wittgenstein außerdem in Erwägung, dass der Zweck 
des Aussprechens der Wörter auch darin bestehen könnte, Vorstellungen der 
bezeichneten Gegenstände hervorzurufen. Aufgrund des Zusammenhangs, in 
dem die Wörter vom Bauendem und seinem Gehilfen verwendet werden, 
kommt dieser denkbare Zweck hier allerdings nicht in Frage. Im Zuge dessen 
wird jedoch deutlich, dass der Gebrauch nicht auf einen Zweck festgelegt ist, 
sondern ein bestimmter Zweck durch ihn erst verständlich wird. 
2 Die durch Davidson bekannt gewordene Herausforderung, jenseits bloßer 
Rationalisierung den wahren Grund (oder Zweck) für eine Handlung anzuge-
ben, kann in dieser Hinsicht als Forderung der Dekontextualisierung verstan-
den werden. Abseits der Zweifel an der Möglichkeit dieses Unternehmens ist

des Befehls darin besteht, dass der Besen gebracht wird, 
ähnlich der Annahme, dass das Wesentliche einer Lampe 
ihr Zweck der Beleuchtung ist. Doch zwischen dem We-
sentlichen und Unwesentlichen besteht nicht immer eine 
scharfe Grenze. Auch in dieser Hinsicht wird die Unter-
scheidung erst durch den Zweck bestimmt.    
Wittgenstein geht noch in zwei weiteren Zusammenhän-
gen auf die Frage nach dem Zweck der Sprache in den 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen ein. Zum einen bezieht 
er sich auf die Behauptung, dass der Zweck der Sprache 
darin bestünde, Gedanken zu übertragen (vgl. PU 2009: 
304). Die irreführende Annahme, die hinter dieser Behaup-
tung steht, ist die Privatheit von Empfindungen und Ge-
danken und ihr Ausdruck durch sprachliche Zeichen. Dar-
auf werde ich aufgrund der Bekanntheit der Argumentation 
hier nicht weiter eingehen. Zum anderen bezieht er sich 
auf die Behauptung, dass der Zweck der Sprache darin 
bestünde, sich miteinander zu verständigen (vgl. PU 2009: 
491). Die Behauptung »ohne Sprache könnten wir uns 
nicht verständigen« greift allerdings dann zu kurz, wenn 
mit »Sprache« der »Apparat […] unserer Wortsprache« 
gemeint ist (PU 2009: 494; vgl. dazu auch TS 213, 194 = 
BT 3.255.9.1). Dieser reicht zwar aus, um Menschen in 
ihrem Verhalten zu beeinflussen, wie auch das Beispiel 
vom Bauendem und seinem Gehilfen zeigt (vgl. auch PU 
2009: 495), doch Wittgensteins Sprachbegriff geht offen-
sichtlich über die Grenzen dieses Apparates hinaus, denn 
er hält außerdem »den Gebrauch der Rede und der 
Schrift« für ein wesentliches Element der Verständigung. 
Damit macht er deutlich, dass Sprache einen technischen 
Charakter besitzt. Nicht die Sprache als solche dient dem 
Zweck der Verständigung, sondern mit der Ausbildung von 
Rede- und Schrifttechniken werden, wie wir gesehen ha-
ben, ganz unterschiedliche Zwecke verfolgt. So gesehen 
ist Verständigung kein außerhalb der Sprache liegender 
Zweck, sondern sie bedeutet an sich das Beherrschen 
sprachlicher Techniken (vgl. PU 2009: 150), zu denen hin-
zukommend auch neue Techniken zu bestimmten Zwe-
cken erfunden werden können (vgl. PU 2009: 492).   
In Bezug auf die Frage nach dem Zweck einzelner Wör-
ter und Sätze kommen wir demzufolge zu dem Schluss, 
dass dieser nicht universalisierbar ist, sondern von dem 
kontextuellen Gebrauch abhängig ist und durch ihn be-
stimmt wird. Wir verwenden sprachliche Techniken zu be-
stimmten Zwecken, die je nach Gebrauchssituation unter-
schiedlich sind. Insofern sprachliche Techniken mit Zwe-
cken verbunden sind, ließe sich ihre Beherrschung in sol-
chen Situationen mit einem zweckrationalen Denken in 
Verbindung bringen, in denen der Zweck des Sprach-
gebrauchs feststeht. Sprache scheint aber in ihrer Anwen-
dung nicht nur einen technischen Charakter zu besitzen, 
der in der Mittelwahl und dem Erfüllen vielfältiger Zwecke 
besteht, sondern darüber hinaus einen übergeordneten 
Selbstzweck, dem die Sprache als Ganzes unterliegt. Auf 
diesen möchte ich im zweiten Teil meiner kurzen Untersu-
chung eingehen.

Das Erfinden einer Sprache, bemerkt Wittgenstein in PU 
492, kann zum einen zu einem bestimmten Zweck erfol-
gen, »es hat aber auch den anderen Sinn, dem analog, in 
welchem wir von der Erfindung eines Spiels reden«
3. Die 
                                                                             
indes nicht zwingend einzusehen, warum der Zweck durch ein bestimmtes 
Ereignis festgelegt werden müsste; vgl. Schroeder 2001, S. 164. 
3 Entschiedener heißt es in TS 213 193 = BT 3.273.5.1: »Eine Sprache erfin-
den, heißt nicht auf Grund von Naturgesetzen (oder im Einklang mit ihnen /in 
Übereinstimmung mit ihnen/) eine Vorrichtung zu einem bestimmten Zweck 
erfinden. Wie es etwa die Erfindung des Benzinmotors oder der Nähmaschine 
Erfindung eines Spiels erfolgt normalerweise – das wissen 
sowohl Kinder als auch Erwachsene – nicht zu einem be-
stimmten (technischen) Zweck, sondern vielmehr besteht 
der Zweck der Erfindung eines Spiels in der Tätigkeit des 
Spielens selbst. Man könnte hier in Anlehnung an die be-
kannte Unterscheidung von Kant zwischen einem subjekti-
ven und einem objektiven Zweck differenzieren (vgl. Kant, 
AA IV, S. 428), wobei letzterer dadurch ausgezeichnet ist, 
dass nicht durch ein Mittel auf ihn hingewirkt wird, sondern 
sein Gegenstand ein Selbstzweck darstellt. Tatsächlich 
weist Wittgenstein bereits in Bemerkungen der frühen 
1930er Jahre darauf hin, dass der Zweck der Sprache 
nicht im Sinne einer Mittel-Zweck-Relation zu verstehen 
ist. Die zwei verschiedenen Perspektiven auf den Zweck 
der Sprache macht er anhand der Analogie zu einem Me-
chanismus deutlich, die indes keinen Eingang in das Big 
Typescript gefunden hat: 
»Die Sprache ist Teil eines Mechanismus (oder zu min-
dest kann man sie so auffassen /sie so aufgefaßt wer-
den/). Mit ihrer Hilfe beeinflussen wir die Handlungen 
anderer Menschen und werden wir beeinflußt.  
Als Teil des Mechanismus, kann man sagen, hat die 
Sprache einen Zweck. Aber die Grammatik kümmert 
sich nicht um den Zweck der Sprache und ob sie ihn er-
füllt. Sowenig wie die Arithmetik um die Anwendung der 
Addition.« (TS 213 193). 
Betrachtet man die Sprache als Mechanismus (Wittgen-
stein spricht diesbezüglich auch von »Grammatik« oder 
»Regeln der Grammatik«) und fokussiert sich daraufhin 
auf einzelne Vorgänge innerhalb des Mechanismus, wie 
wir es exemplarisch im ersten Abschnitt der Untersuchung 
getan haben, dann lässt sich durchaus von einzelnen 
Zwecken des Sprachgebrauchs im Sinne von Mittel-
Zweck-Relationen sprechen (vgl. auch BT 3.243.3.1). 
Wenn hingegen nach dem Zweck des Mechanismus als 
Ganzem gefragt wird, dann wäre dieser in der Form einer 
Mittel-Zweck-Relation als Mittel in das Verhältnis zu einem 
Zweck 
zu 
stellen, 
der 
außerhalb 
seines 
eigenen 
Gebrauchs liegt. Es müsste daraufhin die Frage nach dem 
»Wozu?« beantwortet werden, die indes in irrtümlicher 
Weise implizieren würde, dass der Mechanismus zu einem 
weiteren Zweck diente und in diesem Zusammenhang als 
Mittel zur Disposition gestellt werden könnte. Wäre dies 
der Fall, so die Schlussfolgerung, dann würde sich jedoch 
die Frage nach dem »Wozu?« von vornherein nicht mehr 
stellen (vgl. BT 3.242.5.1; 3.243.1.1). Die Frage nach dem 
Zweck der Sprache kann daher nicht nach der Form einer 
Mittel-Zweck-Relation beantwortet werden, da sonst die 
Gefahr eines Paradoxons droht4. 
Betrachtet man also die Sprache in Bezug auf ihren Me-
chanismus, die Grammatik, dann lässt sich dieser nicht 
durch einen außerhalb ihr liegenden Zweck erklären (vgl. 
dazu auch Schulte 2001, S. 112ff). Der Selbstzweck, der 
der Sprache zukommt, wird nicht von etwas außerhalb ihr 
liegendem bestimmt. Vielmehr könnte man sagen, dass er 
sich mit dem Gebrauchscharakter der Sprache erst konsti-
tuiert. Spricht man der Sprache den Gebrauchscharakter 
ab, dann spricht man ihr ipso facto ihren Selbstzweck und 
damit den Sinn ihres Daseins ab. Da ihr Zweck von nichts 
anderem abhängt als ihrem sich im Gebrauch konstituie-
                                                                             
ist. Auch die Erfindung eines Spiels ist nicht in diesem Sinne eine Erfindung, 
aber vergleichbar der Erfindung einer Sprache.«  
4 Aus der Behauptung »Die Regeln einer Grammatik besitzen einen Zweck« 
folgt, dass der Inhalt der Behauptung aufgegeben werden muss, um ihn zu 
behaupten. Denn eine Sprache, in Bezug auf die der Zweck grammatischer 
Regeln zu Disposition steht ist keine Sprache mehr. An dieser Stelle bezieht 
Wittgenstein das Verbot der Selbstreferenz auf die Grammatik, das er in Folge 
des Russell’schen Paradoxons bereits im Tractatus auf die logische Syntax 
bezogen hatte (vgl. T 3.33ff).

rendem Dasein, sieht sich Wittgenstein zu der Formulie-
rung veranlasst, dass die Grammatik »willkürlich« sei, al-
lerdings nur in gewisser Hinsicht: 
»Man kann die Regeln der Grammatik „willkürlich“ nen-
nen, wenn damit gesagt sein soll, der Zweck der 
Grammatik sei nur der der Sprache.« (PU 2009: 497). 
Eine Bemerkung aus der Philosophischen Grammatik fasst 
die beiden verschiedenen Perspektiven auf Zwecke unter 
dem Aspekt des willkürlichen Charakters der Grammatik in 
erläuternder Form zusammen: 
»Warum nenne ich die Regeln des Kochens nicht will-
kürlich; und warum bin ich versucht, die Regeln der 
Grammatik willkürlich zu nennen? Weil ich den Begriff 
‚Kochen‘ durch den Zwecke des Kochens definiert den-
ke, dagegen den Begriff ‚Sprache‘ nicht durch den 
Zweck der Sprache. Wer sich beim Kochen nach ande-
ren als den richtigen Regeln richtet kocht schlecht; aber 
wer sich nach anderen Regeln als denen des Schach 
richtet, spielt ein anderes Spiel; und wer sich nach an-
deren grammatischen Regeln richtet, als etwa den übli-
chen, spricht darum nichts Falsches, sondern von et-
was Anderem.« (PG 1978: X 133). 
Wittgenstein scheint hier den Unterschied zwischen zwei 
verschiedenen Arten von Regeln markieren zu wollen. 
Zum einen solche, die nach der Form der Mittel-Zweck-
Relation auf Zwecke außerhalb des eigenen Gegenstands 
abzielen, wie z.B. die des Kochens. Andererseits gibt es 
grammatische Regeln, die den Spielregeln ähnlich sind. 
Sie beziehen sich nicht auf instrumentelle Zwecke und 
sind deshalb weder richtig noch falsch5. Interessanterwei-
se werden grammatische Regeln demzufolge nicht durch 
äußere Kriterien normativ gerechtfertigt, und das scheint 
den Anschein ihrer Willkürhafigkeit zu bestätigen. 
Wittgensteins Haltung zur Vorsicht schützt hier vor Miss-
verständnissen. Zwar ist der Selbstzweck der Sprache 
nicht normativ gerechtfertigt, aber er ist deshalb nicht in 
jeder Hinsicht willkürlich. Zwar lässt sich auf ihn nicht die 
Unterscheidung zwischen richtig und falsch anwenden, 
doch dagegen trifft hier die Unterscheidung zwischen 
sinnhaft und unsinnig. Es leuchtet unmittelbar ein, dass 
eine Sprache, die ihren Selbstzweck deshalb verliert, weil 
sie nicht gebrauchsfähig ist, ihren Sinn verliert und sich in 
diesem Fall selbst ad absurdum führt
6. In dieser Hinsicht 
schränkt Wittgenstein den willkürlichen Charakter der 
Sprache auf einer der Manuskriptseiten seines Nachlasses 
deutlich 
ein. 
Gordon 
Baker 
und 
Peter 
Hacker 
kommentieren diese Einschränkung folgendermaßen: 
»A form of representation, e.g. of measuring, is not ar-
bitrary if that suggests that a quite different system 
would do just as well for the same purpose. On the con-
trary; earlier Japanese methods of measuring time 
would be useless in a modern industrial society. It is no 
coincidence that we do not measure rooms in microns 
(MS 166, 6v) or distances between cities in banana 
lengths. Nor is it an arbitrary matter that we use the 
decimal system rather than the Babylonian one (base 
60), or that we do our calculations with Arabic notation 
rather than Roman.« (Baker / Hacker 2009, S. 332). 
                                                      
5 Vgl. dazu bereits Glüer 1999, S. 171. 
6 Diese Überlegung ist unter dem Gedanken der Praktikabilität näher ausge-
führt in Franken 2014. Vgl. dazu schon Franken 2013.  
Die Sinnhaftigkeit der Sprache ist in der Sichtweise, die 
Wittgenstein auf das Wesen der Sprache hat, demzufolge 
dadurch bedingt, dass die Sprache gebrauchsfähig ist. Der 
Selbstzweck der Sinnhaftigkeit lässt sich vor diesem Hin-
tergrund als der Selbstzweck der Gebrauchsfähigkeit ver-
stehen. Sie scheint das »eigentliche Bedürfnis« zu sein, 
um das sich die philosophische Betrachtungsweise dreht 
(vgl. PU 2009: 108). Überlegungen in dieser Richtung 
könnten nun hilfreich sein, um eine wichtige Passage der 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen zu erläutern, die die 
Frage nach dem Zweck der Sprache in die Frage nach 
dem Zweck der Philosophie einbezieht (vgl. PU 2009: 
109ff). Doch diesen Erläuterungen müssen wir in dem hie-
sigen Rahmen vorerst Aufschub gewähren.

Transparency or Opacity of Mind? 
Martin F. Fricke 
Mérida, Mexico | martin_fricke@yahoo.co.uk 
Abstract 
Self-knowledge presents a challenge for naturalistic theories of mind. Peter Carruthers’s (2011) approach to this challenge is 
Rylean: He argues that we know our own propositional attitudes because we (unconsciously) interpret ourselves, just as we 
have to interpret others in order to know theirs’. An alternative approach, opposed by Carruthers, is to argue that we do have a 
special access to our own beliefs, but that this is a natural consequence of our reasoning capacity. This is the approach of 
transparency theories of self-knowledge, neatly encapsulated in Byrne’s epistemic rule (BEL): If p, believe that you believe that 
p (Byrne 2005). In this paper, I examine an objection to Carruthers’s theory in order to see whether it opens up space for a 
transparency theory of self-knowledge: Is it not the case that in order to interpret someone I have to have some direct access to 
what I believe (cf. Friedman and Petrashek 2009)? 
 
 
Self-knowledge presents a challenge for naturalistic theo-
ries of mind. This is because self-knowledge seems to be 
especially secure, while not obviously sharing the features 
that confer security in knowledge of other things. Des-
cartes thought that (some kind of) self-knowledge was the 
most certain knowledge to be had and therefore tried to 
ground all other knowledge on this first certainty. Today we 
have somewhat lost faith in such a foundationalist pro-
gramme. Naturalism in epistemology could be character-
ised as the view that scientific knowledge, especially 
knowledge of the natural sciences, is more certain, at least 
in its totality, than any kind of foundation that philosophers 
might propose for it. It does not need such a foundation. 
The best that philosophy can do is to try and integrate 
whatever theories it cherishes into to the system of scien-
tific knowledge. 
It might be thought that this is exactly what contemporary 
analytic philosophy is trying to do when discussing self-
knowledge. Whether cherished or not, self-knowledge 
concerning beliefs, desires and phenomenal states seems 
to be exceptionally secure; perhaps not completely infalli-
ble, as Descartes might have thought, but much more se-
cure than any ordinary or, indeed scientific, knowledge of 
the world. At the same time, it is clear that it lacks any of 
the features that characterise scientific knowledge. It does 
not seem to be based on observation, inference, experi-
ments, a large body of theoretical knowledge, confirmation 
by peers and so on. Some think that it is not based on any-
thing and it certainly seems to be much more direct than 
any scientific knowledge. If that is so, then, in the context 
of naturalism, the phenomenon of self-knowledge is in 
need of explanation. We might not want to accord it any 
great importance for the rest of our theories, as did Des-
cartes. But there is no doubt that its apparent possibility 
does need to be accounted for. 
In this paper I shall look at two theories of self-
knowledge that approach this problem in different ways. 
The first one, proposed by Peter Carruthers, stands in the 
tradition of Gilbert Ryle (1949). It says that our knowledge 
of our own propositional attitudes is acquired in the same 
way as our knowledge of the propositional attitudes of 
other people. We have a mindreading module that we can 
either apply to others or to ourselves and when we apply it 
to ourselves we acquire self-knowledge of our own pro-
positional attitudes. So self-knowledge is not really that 
special and different; it is just nourished by a special 
wealth of data, since we are with ourselves all day long, 
gathering evidence for possible self-attributions, while hav-
ing to work with more limited data when it comes to others. 
The second theory is that suggested by Alex Byrne, 
which in turn is inspired by Gareth Evans’s famous remark 
that I “answer the question whether I believe that p by put-
ting into operation whatever procedure I have for answer-
ing the question whether p” (Evans 1982: 225). Theories 
that take their cue from this observation have been la-
belled transparency theories of self-knowledge because 
they regard the question of whether I believe that p as 
“transparent to” the question of whether p. Byrne tries to 
encapsulate this transparency in the following epistemic 
rule: 
(BEL) If p, believe that you believe that p (Byrne 2005: 
95) 
Following this rule, even merely trying to follow it, but get-
ting one’s facts wrong (i.e. it is not true that p), will produce 
true self-ascriptions of belief. It does not rely on percep-
tion, but rather on very simple inferential skills: to go from 
“p” to “I believe that p”. Byrne thinks that this explains the 
special security of self-knowledge. There is so little that 
can go wrong. In addition to this “privileged access”, (BEL) 
is also supposed to explain our “peculiar access” to our 
own beliefs. If I were to go from “p” to “He believes that p”, 
I would be much more likely to make a false belief-
ascription. So the kind of access described in (BEL) is pe-
culiar to one’s own mind. There is no equivalent kind of 
access to other people’s minds. So in contrast to Car-
ruthers’s Rylean theory of self-knowledge, Byrne attempts 
to show that we do have a special kind of access to our 
own minds, differentiated not only by the amount of data 
from which we reason about ourselves, but also by the 
method through which we know ourselves, a method which 
is only applicable to ourselves. We might say that Byrne 
answers the challenge to naturalism not by denying the 
specialness of self-knowledge, but by showing that this 
specialness is a consequence of the normal powers of 
reasoning combined with a simple epistemic rule. 
My own sympathies lie with Byrne’s account. So for the 
rest of this paper I shall discuss an objection that followers 
of Byrne might put forward against Carruthers’s theory. 
The originality of Carruthers’s approach does not, of 
course, lie in his Ryleanism, but in the way he defends it 
with the help of contemporary cognitive science. Central to 
this defence is a modular theory of mind with a “global 
broadcast architecture”. The idea is that the mind consists 
of different specialised systems organised around a com-
mon workspace. The systems cannot communicate di-
rectly with each other, but only via messages that are 
globally broadcast in the workspace, thereby becoming

access conscious. This setup resembles somewhat that of 
a bunch of specialists in different areas of science who are 
gathered around a blackboard and can only communicate 
by writing on the board. The crucial feature, for our pur-
poses, of the common workspace is that it can only broad-
cast sensory messages, for example perceptual states, 
images or instances of inner speech. Decisions, judg-
ments, beliefs, intentions or other propositional attitudes 
cannot be globally broadcast as such. They have to be 
expressed in sensory states such as images or speech 
first. Now, one of the systems constituting the mind is a 
mindreading faculty, used to attribute mental states to 
other people (or, presumably, nonhuman animals). Accord-
ing to Carruthers, it is this mindreading faculty which also 
provides us with knowledge of our own mental states. For 
this purpose, it has to use the information it receives via 
the common workspace of the mind. It does not have a 
general direct access to the subject’s propositional atti-
tudes because these are not globally broadcast, except 
when transformed into sensory data. And even if they are 
presented sensorily, the sensory data – what we hear 
someone, in this case ourselves, saying, for example – still 
have to be interpreted by the mindreading faculty to de-
termine what propositional attitude is expressed by them. 
If all of this is true, then the mindreading faculty cannot 
apply a procedure such as Byrne’s epistemic rule (BEL). 
To apply the rule “If p, believe that you believe that p” we 
first have to know (or at least think that we know) that p. In 
other words, we have to have access to the content of the 
first-order belief to be attributed, i.e. we have to have ac-
cess to what is believed. But if Carruthers is right, the min-
dreading system does not have a general access to what 
is believed. It only has access to what is perceived or 
imagined in some sort of way and thus globally broadcast 
in the workspace. (So if there were a procedure analogous 
to that encapsulated in (BEL) for self-ascribing perceptual 
or imagistic states, as opposed to propositional attitudes, 
this could be applied by the mindreading system. And in 
fact, Carruthers does think that our access to our own per-
ceptual states is transparent in this sense and not de-
pendent on interpretation. Cf. Carruthers 2011: 72ff.) 
Carruthers discusses a large body of empirical evidence 
and other considerations in favour of his proposal. For ex-
ample, he argues that the global broadcast architecture is 
best suited to explain the possibility of a gradual develop-
ment of the mind in incremental steps, where one system 
after another is aggregated through natural evolution. This 
also explains, he says, why nonsensory mental events 
such as judgments or decisions cannot be globally broad-
cast – the broadcast architecture was in place before such 
a redesign of the basic architecture could have been use-
ful. He also discusses at length many cases in which sub-
jects seem to confabulate what their own intentions, de-
sires and even beliefs are. For example, hypnotised per-
sons who receive an order, frequently, when woken up, 
comply with the order; say putting a book from the desk 
onto the shelf. But when asked why they do so, they ex-
plain that they dislike the disorder and decided to clean up 
or some such (cf. Wegner 2002). Carruthers interprets 
such cases as evidence for the view that self-attributions of 
propositional attitudes are based on unconscious self-
interpretations. When we confabulate an intention that 
clearly is (or was?) not there, we interpret ourselves – how 
else should the self-attribution come about? Because we 
lack some relevant information our interpretation is errone-
ous. Since we are not aware that we are “just interpreting”, 
it might well be that we always base our self-attributions on 
interpretations, even when they are true. 
There is not enough space for me to discuss these ar-
guments here. Instead, let me focus on one particular ob-
jection to Carruthers’s theory of mindreading and on his 
reply to it, because they shed light on the relation between 
his account and transparency theories of self-knowledge 
such as Byrne’s. As we have seen, Carruthers claims that 
the mindreading system does not have a general access 
to the subject’s beliefs, intentions, decisions etc. Rather, 
just as all the other systems, it has to make do with the 
information it receives through global broadcasts of sen-
sory information (and a limited amount of principles, data 
and so on specifically necessary for mindreading). But – 
this is the objection put forward by several commentators 
(cf. Currie and Sterelny 2000, Friedman and Petrashek 
2009, Lurz 2009) – is it possible to interpret other people’s 
minds without having a general access to one’s own be-
liefs? It seems that we often need information about the 
world that is not perceptually present at the time of inter-
pretation in order to attribute mental states to other people. 
We interpret them not only in the light of what we observe 
right now, but also in the light of what we believe about 
them and about the world in general. 
Here is an example from Friedman and Petrashek: 
“Louise is an expert in British history, so she knows that 
the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066” (Friedman and 
Petrashek 2009: 146). We attribute such knowledge (a 
propositional attitude) to Louise because we believe that 
the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066, that Louise is an 
expert in British history and that experts in British history 
know such things. So reading the mind of Louise depends, 
in this case, on access to our own beliefs. It is imaginable 
that the three (supposed) facts in question are presented 
sensorily to the subject. For example, the subject might 
read about them, as you are now. However, while this 
might happen, it seems that no such sensory access is 
necessary for one to attribute the knowledge to Louise. It 
seems that the knowledge-attribution could proceed direct-
ly on the basis of our beliefs, without a sensory intermedi-
ary. If that is so, then we seem to have a counter example 
to Carruthers’s theory. 
In fact, it might be a general principle of mindreading, 
other things being equal, first to attribute the same beliefs 
to others as we have ourselves.  If I take p to be true, then, 
without reasons to the contrary, I should attribute the belief 
that p to others as well. So in fact there is a rule such as 
(BEL) for attributing beliefs to others: 
(BEL-3) If p, believe that Fred believes that p. (Byrne 
2005: 96) 
Although (BEL-3) is not, of course, as useful as (BEL) in 
producing true belief-ascriptions, it is still at least a good 
starting point for mindreaders. 
Now, if these arguments are correct, then, contrary to 
what was said before, it seems that our mindreading sys-
tem, or some other mechanism, does have nonsensory 
access to our own beliefs in the sense that it has access to 
what we believe. This means that it should not need to use 
the Rylean method for self-ascribing beliefs. If it can attrib-
ute the belief that the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066 
to Louise, reasoning from the (supposed) facts that it did 
occur on that date and that Louise is an expert in British 
history, then it should also be able to apply an epistemic 
rule such as Byrne’s (BEL). It should be able, in other 
words, to reason from the (supposed) fact (i.e. from the 
belief) that Louise is an expert in British history directly to 
the belief that I believe that Louise is an expert in British 
history. All it needs for such reasoning is an epistemic rule 
such as (BEL).

Carruthers’s reply to this objection is threefold. First, he 
concedes that rules such as (BEL) and (BEL-3) can be 
used by us, but he says that it is not the mindreading sys-
tem that applies them and that they lead to merely verbal 
self-attributions of belief. Second, he concedes that the 
mindreading system can have access to all of the subject’s 
beliefs, but only indirectly via the global workspace and 
operating in a slow and reflective, system 2-type of way. 
Third, he maintains that, in automatic or “online”, system 1-
type of operation, the mindreading system only has access 
to sensory information. 
To focus on the second and third part of his reply first, it 
is clear that Carruthers does not think that the mindreading 
system ever uses rules such as (BEL) or (BEL-3). He 
maintains that it does not have any direct access to the 
subject’s own beliefs. When mindreading happens in an 
automatic or “online” way (the third part of Carruthers’s 
reply), the system mainly interprets occurrent sensory in-
formation and does not have access to the stored beliefs 
and other propositional attitudes of the subject. But there is 
a different, slower and more reflective way of operating in 
which the mindreading system can access all the subject’s 
propositional attitudes. It can do so by posting queries in 
the common workspace of the mind. “The entire suite of 
consumer systems then gets to work, drawing inferences 
and reasoning in their normal way, accessing whichever of 
the subject’s belief they normally would. The results are 
then posted back into the global workspace once more, 
[…] Here the entire process, collectively, has access to all 
of the agent’s beliefs;” (Carruthers 2011: 238). In this re-
flective mode, the mindreading has access to all of the 
subject’s beliefs, but only indirectly, via the global work-
space. Since any information from the workspace is senso-
rial, it needs to be interpreted to yield information about the 
subject’s propositional attitudes. 
The first part of Carruthers’s reply to the objection is 
more interesting in our context. For Carruthers concedes 
that we in effect use rules such as (BEL) and (BEL-3) to 
attribute beliefs. It is just that these rules are not imple-
mented by the mindreading system, but by the executive 
and language-production systems and the result is not real 
self-knowledge (or knowledge others’ beliefs). Rather, Car-
ruthers seems to think that it is a purely verbal attribution 
that we can make in reply to a verbal question: 
If my task is to say which city someone believes to be 
the capital of the United Kingdom, for example, then I 
shall immediately answer, “London,” without knowing 
anything further about that person. […] the executive 
and language-production systems cooperate (and partly 
compete) with one another, searching the attributor’s 
own memory and issuing the result in the form of a 
metarepresentational report – “I think/she thinks that P” 
– where the form of the report can be copied from the 
form of the initial question. (Carruthers 2011: 237) 
This account of how we can come to make “a metarepre-
sentational report” seems to be quite in line with transpar-
ency accounts such as Byrne’s. The crucial difference is 
that Carruthers does not think that the report expresses 
self-knowledge (in case of having the form “I think that P”) 
or knowledge of the beliefs of others (in case of having the 
form “She thinks that P”). Rather, the prefix (in the case of 
the first-personal report) is “a mere manner of speech or a 
matter of politeness (so as not to appear too confident or 
too definite)” (Carruthers 2011: 86).  
What is curious about this position is that it does not 
seem to make a distinction between self and other-
attributions of belief. What is the difference, in the 
speaker’s mind, between “I believe that p” and “He be-
lieves that p”, if the prefix is only a mere manner of 
speech? It seems that, according to Carruthers, there is 
none. Rather, it is only by interpreting our own verbal re-
ports that we find out about whom we are talking. Yet more 
strangely, even if we say “He believes that p” we are not 
actually expressing a belief about some other person, but 
only the belief that p. 
To conclude, where does this discussion leave transpar-
ency theories of self-knowledge? If we take Carruthers 
seriously, there is a place for transparent self-ascriptions of 
belief: It lies in our immediate and, presumably, unreflec-
tive verbal answers to questions about our beliefs. Here 
we directly access the first-order belief and merely verbally 
prefix it with “I believe that …”, thus applying Evans’s pro-
cedure. But if Carruthers is right, the result is not self-
knowledge, but a mere manner of speech. It is unlikely that 
this will satisfy transparency theorist such as Byrne. It also 
has the odd consequence that we often seem to talk about 
beliefs without knowing whether they are our own or 
someone else’s.

Modelle und Metaphern 
Georg Friedrich 
Aachen, Deutschland | georg.friedrich@rwth-aachen.de 
Abstract 
In fast allen wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen trifft man im Rahmen von Hypothesen und Theorien auf Modelle. Physiker erklären 
subatomare Strukturen anhand des bohrschen Atommodells, Psychologen nutzen Verhaltensanalysemodelle zur Vorhersage 
von pathologischen Verhaltensweisen, Biologen sprechen über die Erbinformationen von Lebewesen mithilfe des Strukturmo-
dells der DNA und Soziologen gehen davon aus, dass sich mit Modellen das soziale Verhalten von Gruppen adäquat beschrei-
ben lässt. Eine Problematik von Modellen ist, dass sie sich auf einer höheren Abstraktionsebene befinden als die empirisch be-
obachteten Daten. Modelle sind in der wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft dennoch akzeptiert, denn sie erklären die beobachte-
ten Phänomene und erlauben es, Vorhersagen zu treffen. Metaphern sind insofern wichtig, als eine große Anzahl von wissen-
schaftlichen Begriffen selbst eine Metapher oder zumindest metaphorischem Ursprungs ist. Da Metaphern eine nicht-wörtliche 
Redeweise sind, stellt sich hiermit die zweite Problematik. In diesem Beitrag soll die Frage beantwortet werden, inwiefern Mo-
delle und Metaphern in der Philosophie Anwendung finden und finden können. 
 
 
Eine metaphorische Bestimmung der Metaphysik lautet, 
sie sei „eine Wissenschaft von den Grenzen der menschli-
chen Vernunft“ (Kant 1916, 368). In fast allen wissen-
schaftlichen Disziplinen bedient man sich sehr erfolgreich 
des Erklärungswertes von Modellen. Eine Gemeinsamkeit 
von wissenschaftlichen Modellen und Metaphern ist, dass 
beide Charakteristiken des untersuchten Gegenstandes 
bzw. des Gegenstandsbereichs aufzeigen, die ohne sie 
möglicherweise nicht wahrgenommen würden. Kritischere 
Betrachter gehen sogar davon aus, dass die aufgezeigten 
Charakteristiken erst durch die Verwendung einer Meta-
pher geschaffen werden; die Sprache beeinflusst unsere 
Weltsicht. Metaphern werden zudem bei der Einführung 
neuer wissenschaftlicher Begriffe verwendet; einen meta-
phorischen Ausdruck zu verwenden kann dann von Vorteil 
sein, wenn dieser im Vergleich zu einer wörtlichen Formu-
lierung besonders anschaulich oder einprägsam ist. In die-
sem Beitrag soll der Frage nachgegangen werden, inwie-
fern die Verwendung von Modellen und Metaphern auch 
im philosophischen Diskurs sinnvoll erscheinen kann. Ein 
naheliegender Einwand dagegen wäre, dass man im wis-
senschaftlichen Diskurs im Allgemeinen von der Verwen-
dung metaphorischer Ausdrücke absehen und stattdessen 
wörtliche Formulierungen verwenden sollte, da dies eher 
dem stringenten und klaren Vorgehen der Wissenschaft 
entsprechen würde. Und wenn Modelle tatsächlich Ideali-
sierungen sind, sind sie keine ontologisch adäquate Be-
schreibung der Wirklichkeit. Um zu sehen, ob diese Ein-
wände entkräftet werden können, muss man sich klar ma-
chen, was Modelle und Metaphern sind. 
Modelle 
Modelle sind im einfachsten Fall Verkleinerungen oder 
Vergrößerungen ihres Originals, etwa dann, wenn ein Ar-
chitekt ein Modell eines Hauses anfertigt, meist ist die 
Ähnlichkeit zwischen dem Modell und dem dargestellten 
Original jedoch bloß struktureller Art; die Grundlage der 
Ähnlichkeit ist dann eine Isomorphie oder zumindest eine 
teilweise Isomorphie, d. h. allen relevanten Teilen des Ori-
ginals spiegeln sich in einem Teil des Modells wider (Black 
1962). Alle folgenden Beispiele sind Modelle der zweiten 
Art: Physiker erklären subatomare Strukturen anhand des 
bohrschen Atommodells, Psychologen nutzen Verhaltens-
analysemodelle zur Vorhersage von pathologischen Ver-
haltensweisen, Biologen sprechen über die Erbinformatio-
nen von Lebewesen mithilfe des Strukturmodells der DNA 
und Soziologen gehen davon aus, dass sich mit Modellen 
das soziale Verhalten von Gruppen beschreiben lässt. Ei-
ne Problematik all dieser Modelle ist, dass sie sich auf ei-
ner höheren Abstraktionsebene befinden als die beobach-
teten Daten; es handelt sich um Idealisierungen, die ge-
wisse Charakteristiken des Originals vernachlässigen und 
andere herausgreifen. Im wissenschaftlichen Diskurs 
übernehmen Modelle nicht nur die Funktion, eine Theorie 
zu veranschaulichen, es werden auch Betrachtungen am 
Modell angestellt und Schlussfolgerungen daraus gezo-
gen. 
Die Frage, in welcher Beziehung ein Modell zum darge-
stellten Objekt steht, lässt sich nicht ganz einfach beant-
worten, erlangt aber Bedeutung, wenn aufgrund der Beo-
bachtung gewisser Eigenschaften am Modell darauf ge-
schlossen wird, dass auch das Original dieses Eigenschaf-
ten besitzen muss. Solche Schlüsse haben einen prekären 
Staus, vor allem, da die Ähnlichkeit zwischen Original und 
Modell auch metaphorischer Art sein kann, z. B. dann, 
wenn man das Verhältnis eines Staates zu seinen Bürgern 
so beschreibt als würde es sich um das Verhältnis eines 
Vaters zu seinen Kindern handeln. Alle Schüsse aus Mo-
dellen bedürfen einer zusätzlichen Rechtfertigung. 
Metaphern 
Natürliche Sprachen sind mit metaphorischen Ausdrücken 
durchsetzt, eine ausschließlich wörtliche Redeweise ist 
kaum vorstellbar, denn sie würde einen Sprecher über 
Gebühr einschränken. Die in der Rhetorik und der 
Sprachwissenschaft oft vorgenommene Einteilung in le-
bende Metaphern und tote Metaphern erklärt weder, wie 
wir Metaphern erkennen, noch, wie wir Metaphern verste-
hen. Auch die sogenannte Vergleichstheorie, die auf Aris-
toteles zurückgeht, und die kausale Metapherntheorie von 
Donald Davidson (1978) werden dem Phänomen der Me-
tapher nicht gerecht. Nach der Interaktionstheorie (Black 
1980) bringt eine Metapher zwei Gegenstände zueinander 
in Beziehung, indem sie einige Charakteristiken des soge-
nannten wörtlichen Rahmens (Sekundärgegenstand) auf 
den metaphorischen Fokus (Primärgegenstand) bezieht. 
Die Charakteristiken des wörtlichen Rahmens, genannt 
Implikationszusammenhang, sind nichts anderes als All-
tagswissen über diesen wörtlichen Rahmen. Nach Max 
Black kann eine Metapher in verschiedenem Grade als 
ersetzbar und reich an Implikationen gesehen werden. Me-
taphern zeigen so Ähnlichkeiten zwischen den beiden Ge-
genständen auf oder erzeugen diese sogar. In der starken

Metapher „Heutzutage ist die Zeit ist ein Cadillac ohne 
Bremsen“ werden beispielsweise die Bilder der Schnellig-
keit und der Unkontrollierbarkeit einer ungebremsten Fahrt 
aus dem wörtlichen Rahmen auf den metaphorischen Fo-
kus Zeit übertragen. Der Sprecher bedient sich der Meta-
pher, da er mehr mitteilen kann, als mit einer wörtlichen 
Äußerung; durch eine Metapher wird nicht nur Inhalt kom-
muniziert, es werden Emotionen transportiert und Assozia-
tionen hervorgerufen, die in einer wörtlichen Äußerung 
nicht im selben Maß enthalten sein könnten. Was hier ein 
Vorteil der metaphorischen Redeweise zu sein scheint, 
könnte in einigen Kontexten ein großer Nachteil sein: Die 
Erschließung der vom Sprecher einer metaphorischen Äu-
ßerung intendierten Bedeutung ist alles andere als einfach 
und klar. Eine klare, verständliche und nachvollziehbare 
Ausdrucksweise ist jedoch ein grundlegendes Desiderat 
nicht nur der Philosophie, sondern auch aller anderen wis-
senschaftlichen Disziplinen. 
Die Alltagssprache ist reich an Metaphern und Ausdrü-
cken metaphorischen Ursprungs. Ist von Raumschiffen, 
Handschuhen oder Tischbeinen die Rede, so wird wahr-
scheinlich auch ein kompetenter Sprecher nicht bemerken, 
dass diese Begriffe metaphorischen Ursprungs sind, mit 
denen einst eine Lücke im Wortschatz geschlossen wurde 
(Katechese). Auch die „Lücke im Wortschatz“ ist eine Me-
tapher, sie ist etwas weniger verblasst, als die zuvor ge-
nannten Beispiele. Und schließlich wäre die Cadillac-
Metapher als aktive und kreative Metapher anzusehen. Es 
ist eine Frage des Grades ist, wie aktiv bzw. verblasst 
(stark/schwach) eine Metapher ist. 
In einem nächsten Schritt ist es wichtig, sich dessen be-
wusst zu sein, dass auch wissenschafliche Begriffe Meta-
phern oder zumindest metaphorischen Ursprungs sein 
können. Wenn jemand von Kraftfeldern spricht, so denkt er 
dabei an Dinge, die mit Weizenfeldern nur eine entfernte 
Ähnlichkeit, wenn überhaupt, aufweisen. Wurmlöcher sind 
Besonderheiten in der Struktur des Raumes und kaum mit 
den Löchern vergleichbar, die Würmer in Äpfel fressen. In 
beiden Fällen ist klar, dass die Metapher bloß dazu dient, 
die Theorie anschaulich vorstellbar zu machen, es könnte 
aber jederzeit anstatt der Metapher ein mathematisches 
Modell zur Beschreibung der Phänomene verwendet wer-
den. Anders verhält es sich bei der metaphorischen Vor-
stellung in der Psychologie, die das menschliche Ge-
dächtnis als Speicher, das Gehirn als Computer oder Ge-
danken als Information beschreibt (Boyd 1980, 360). In 
diesen Fällen werden Metaphern wörtlich bzw. ernst ge-
nommen, wobei aus der metaphorischen Beschreibung 
der Wirklichkeit direkt Schlussfolgerungen gezogen wer-
den; Richard Boyd nennt dies theoriekonstituierende Me-
taphern; hier scheint es nicht möglich zu sein, anstatt der 
Metapher eine wörtliche Paraphrase zu verwenden. 
Das Problem der inkommensurablen  
Modelle 
Welches Modell ist eine adäquate Beschreibung der Reali-
tät? Nimmt man einen inter- und transdisziplinären Stand-
punkt ein, so gelangen bald die sich gegenseitig wider-
sprechenden Modelle der einzelnen wissenschaftlichen 
Disziplinen ins Blickfeld. Begriffe, die aus Modellen ver-
schiedener wissenschaftlicher Disziplinen stammen, sind 
inkommensurabel (Friedrich 2005). Jede wissenschaftliche 
Disziplin untersucht die Gegenstände ihres Gegenstands-
bereichs von ihrem Standpunkt aus und mit denjenigen 
Methoden, die ihr eigen sind. Manche Gegenstände befin-
den sich dort, wo sich die Gegenstandsbereiche der ein-
zelnen wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen überschneiden. 
Gemeint sind nicht Begriffe, wie „Kausalität“, die in mehre-
ren wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen wichtig sind und ver-
wendet werden; aber dort nicht untersucht wird, sondern 
Dinge, die tatsächlich von mehreren wissenschaftlichen 
Disziplinen untersucht werden, wie das menschliche Be-
wusstsein, der Raum oder die Zeit. Es gibt keine neutrale 
Sprache, in welche die Begriffe der beiden Theorien über-
setzt werden könnten, um sie zu vergleichen; ein Vergleich 
wäre methodisch falsch. 
In jeder wissenschaftlichen Disziplin versucht man, den 
Gegenstandsbereich in intersubjektiver Weise zu untersu-
chen. Das Ziel jeder wissenschaftlichen Disziplin ist es, die 
Gegenstände selbst zu beschreiben, und zwar in bestmög-
licher Weise. Streng genommen gibt es aber nur eine ein-
zige angemessene Beschreibung eines Gegenstandes. 
Von zwei sich widersprechenden Beschreibungen kann 
daher nur eine wahr sein. Dessen ungeachtet haben alle 
Zugänge zu einem untersuchten Gegenstand eine Berech-
tigung, denn sie haben eine Funktion in der jeweiligen 
Theorie. Ein alltägliches Beispiel ist es, wenn Quine (1979, 
24) über die phänomenalistische und über die physikalisti-
sche Beschreibungsweise von Pfennigen nachdenkt; er 
spricht von konkurrierenden Begriffsschemata und fragt 
sich, welches den Vorzug genießen sollte. Quine meint, 
dass jedes einzelne Begriffsschema seine Vorzüge hat 
und jedes entwickelt werden sollte, beispielsweise da es 
einfacher ist als die buchstäbliche Wahrheit. Ein Begriffs-
schema ist bestenfalls die Wahrheit und schlechtestenfalls 
ein nützlicher Mythos. Jedenfalls braucht auch hier Nütz-
lichkeit keine Signifikanz zu implizieren. In der Wissen-
schaft geht es nicht immer um Wahrheit oder Falschheit, 
wenn es das Ziel ist, Vorhersagen über das Verhalten von 
Elementen des Gegenstandsbereichs zu machen. Auch 
mit einer erwiesenermaßen falschen Theorie, wie z. B. der 
klassischen Physik, kann man Vorhersagen machen, die 
mit den empirisch beobachtbaren Tatsachen gut überein-
stimmen. Pointiert könnte man das so sagen: Wenn eine 
Theorie es ermöglicht, die Welt so zu beeinflussen, wie 
man dies beabsichtigt, dann spielt es eine untergeordnete 
Rolle, ob diese Theorie streng genommen wahr oder 
falsch ist; sie funktioniert. Ich meine daher, dass man ge-
gebenenfalls dazu übergehen sollte, von Korrektheit oder 
von Richtigkeit zu sprechen. Man kann so tun, als ob die 
betreffenden Aussagen wahr wären, solange man nicht 
wissen will, was die buchstäbliche Wahrheit ist.  
Für die Verwendung von Modellen ergibt sich daraus die 
positive Antwort, dass gewisse Vereinfachungen und Re-
duktionen irrelevant sein können, wenn es bloß darum 
geht, die Wirklichkeit zu beeinflussen. 
Philosophische Metaphern und Modelle 
Inwiefern können Metaphern und Modelle auch im philo-
sophischen Diskurs gewinnbringend verwendet werden? 
Beispiele für starke Metaphern finden sich kaum in der 
analytischen Philosophie, dafür umso mehr bei sogenann-
ten „postmodernen“ Philosophen. Jaques Derrida ist er-
staunt über die Tatsache, dass die Metapher, „eine offen-
sichtlich so ermüdete und verbrauchte Person“ (Derrida 
1998, 200), gegenwärtig wieder Interesse hervorruft. Wört-
lich genommen keine Metapher, doch sehr leicht in eine 
solche zu verwandeln, ist Otto Neuraths Bild vom Philoso-
phen als Seefahrer:  „Wie Schiffer sind wir, die ihr Schiff 
auf offener See umbauen müssen, ohne es jemals in ei-
nem Dock zerlegen und aus besten Bestandteilen neu er-
richten zu können“ (Quine 1980, 5). Philosophen wie Mar-
tin Heidegger sprechen davon, dass „[d]ie Sprache […] 
das Haus den Seins“ ist (Heidegger 2000, 5). Auch den 
Satz Paul Virilios „[Die Teletechnologien der Echtzeit] töten 

Modelle und Metaphern | Georg Friedrich 
 
 
 102
die ‚Gegenwart‘“ (Vililio 2001, 21) kann man nur verstehen, 
wenn man ihn als metaphorische Äußerung auffasst. Die 
Einwände gegen die Verwendung von Metaphern und Mo-
dellen in der Philosophie sind verschiedenartig. Gegen die 
Verwendung von Metaphern spricht, dass die wörtliche 
Bedeutung einer metaphorischen Äußerung nicht immer 
klar zu sein scheint, wie die an dieser Stelle angeführten 
Beispiele zeigen. Was meint jemand, wenn er sagt, dass 
die Metapher eine verbrauchte Person oder die Sprache 
das Haus des Seins ist? Die Bedeutung dieser Sätze er-
schließt sich allenfalls im Kontext. Kennt man die Bedeu-
tung eines Satzes nicht, so kann man unter Umständen 
nicht sagen, ob ein Satz, der eine Metapher enthält, wahr 
oder falsch ist. 
Schwieriger ist es bei philosophischen Modellen. Gegen 
die Verwendung von philosophischen Modellen spricht, 
dass Modelle notwendigerweise Vereinfachungen sind; 
andernfalls wäre die Verwendung eines Modells sinnlos. 
Damit könnte die im philosophischen Kontext nötige Ex-
aktheit nicht gegeben sein; das Problem der inkommensu-
rablen Modelle zeigt, dass man nicht in allen wissenschaft-
lichen Disziplinen dieselbe Genauigkeit erwarten kann, 
nicht alle Gegenstandsbereiche lassen die gleiche Exakt-
heit zu. In der Philosophie des Geistes trifft man auf kon-
kurrierende Modelle, die das Körper-Geist-Problem lösen 
und das Verhältnis von Bewusstsein und Körper erklären 
sollen: Dualismus, Materialismus, Epiphänomenalismus, 
Idealismus etc. (Taylor 1974, 18). Damit könnte man sich 
die Frage stellen, ob diese verschiedenen Modelle des 
Verhältnisses von Körper und Geist in gleicher Weise funk-
tionieren wie z. B. naturwissenschaftliche oder soziologi-
sche Modelle des dabei untersuchten Gegenstandsbe-
reichs. Zweifellos handelt es sich bei den angeführten Mo-
dellen nicht um Verfeinerungen oder Vergrößerungen ei-
nes Originals, es müsste also eine strukturelle Ähnlichkeit 
zwischen Original und Modell feststellbar sein. An dieser 
Stelle zeigt sich eine grundsätzliche Schwierigkeit einer 
nicht empirisch vorgehenden Wissenschaft; aufgrund des 
transzendenten Charakters vieler von der Philosophie un-
tersuchter Gegenstände, eben auch der Relation von Kör-
per und Geist, ist es prinzipiell unmöglich, eine Ähnlichkeit 
zwischen Original und Modell festzustellen. Man sollte da-
her festhalten, dass, wenn von philosophischen Modellen 
die Rede ist, man den Begriff Modell jedenfalls in meta-
phorischer Weise verwendet. Max Black (1962, 219) gibt 
sogar zu bedenken, dass schon die Redeweise von wis-
senschaftlichen (isomorphen) Modellen eine metaphori-
sche Redeweise zu sein scheint, nur ein materielles Mo-
dell wäre ein Modell im wörtlichen Sinn. 
Metaphern, nicht Modelle 
Die vermeintlich größte Schwierigkeit bei der Verwendung 
von metaphorischen Ausdrücken in der Philosophie ist, 
dass die Bedeutung eines metaphorischen Ausdrucks zu-
nächst unklar zu sein scheint. Ähnlich wie in den empiri-
schen Disziplinen kann man jedoch bei Metaphern zwi-
schen starken, kreativen Metaphern und Katechesen un-
terscheiden. Dabei kann es sei, dass das, was ein neu 
eingeführter Begriff metaphorischen Ursprungs bezeich-
net, weder klar definiert ist noch klar definiert werden kann. 
Für schwache Metaphern ist eine Lösung greifbar. Der 
Referent eines neuen Begriffs kann nicht nur durch eine 
klassische Definition festgelegt werden, sondern auch 
durch eine ostensive Definition vor dem Hintergrund einer 
kausalen Theorie der Referenz (Kuhn 1980), womit man 
weiterhin über Schwarze Löcher oder über die Grenzen 
eines Begriffs sprechen kann. 
Werden starke Metaphern verwendet, so ist der Interpre-
tationsspielraum des Rezipienten naturgemäß größer. 
Möglicherweise muss man dabei auch davon ausgehen, 
dass es nicht die primäre Intention des Metaphernprodu-
zenten ist, einen Inhalt zu kommunizieren, sondern Emoti-
onen zu transportieren und Assoziationen zu wecken. 
Modelle werden dazu verwendet, einen Gegenstand in 
vereinfachter Weise zu beschreiben und daraus Schluss-
folgerungen abzuleiten. Das Ziel der einer philosophischen 
Untersuchung ist es nicht, zu vereinfachen und zu reduzie-
ren, sondern den untersuchten Gegenstand in vollem Um-
fang und in allen Details zu erfassen, weshalb man auf die 
Verwendung von Modellen im Sinne der empirischen Wis-
senschaftsdisziplinen verzichten muss.

Scepticism, Isolation, and Morality. Cavell and Kripke on the 
Philosophical Investigations 
Frederik A. Gierlinger 
Vienna, Austria | fgierlinger@gmail.com 
Abstract 
Stanley Cavell and Saul Kripke have both argued that an adequate understanding of what Ludwig Wittgenstein sought to 
achieve in the Philosophical Investigations requires a proper understanding of the scepticism that is expressed therein. They 
disagree, however, on what the sceptical challenge is and on whether and how it can be met. This short essay is an attempt to 
clarify where their accounts agree, where they differ, and to indicate what consequences their views have for interpreting the 
Philosophical Investigations. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
In The Claim of Reason Stanley Cavell gives an ingenious 
interpretation of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Inves-
tigations. A central feature of Cavell‘s reading is his strong 
emphasis on the importance of scepticism. Very early in 
The Claim of Reason he notes that “Wittgenstein’s teach-
ing is everywhere controlled by a response to skepticism, 
or, as I will prefer to say, by a response to the threat of 
skepticism.” (Cavell 1979: 7) Three years later Saul 
Kripke’s remarkable essay Wittgenstein on Rules and Pri-
vate Language is published wherein which Kripke states 
that “[i]f the work has a main thesis of its own, it is that 
Wittgenstein’s sceptical problem and argument are impor-
tant, deserving of serious consideration.” (Kripke 1982: ix). 
Indeed, “[t]he sceptical paradox is the fundamental prob-
lem of Philosophical Investigations.” (Kripke 1982: 78). It is 
thus unsurprising that Cavell and Kripke both argue that an 
adequate understanding of the Philosophical Investiga-
tions requires that the sceptic’s challenge is understood. 
Interestingly enough, neither Cavell nor Kripke believe 
Wittgenstein to be (primarily) concerned with a sceptic ar-
guing that we can never know of the existence of anything 
around us. 
What sort of scepticism is it then, that the Philosophical 
Investigations are meant to address? It is in answering this 
question that Cavell and Kripke part ways. While Kripke 
lays much stress on Wittgenstein’s treatment of rules and 
rule-following, Cavell considers the notion of criteria to be 
truly pivotal. 
2. Scepticism and criteria 
What are criteria? Criteria are the means by which we 
know what kind of object anything is; and, according to 
Cavell, friends and foes alike agree that Wittgenstein 
heavily relies on criteria in his attempts to reject sceptical 
arguments: 
“On the part both of those who wish to defend Wittgen-
stein and those who wish to attack him, it is taken, 
roughly, that his criteria are supposed to be the means 
by which the existence of something is established with 
certainty.” (Cavell 1979: 6) 
Without a doubt this analysis is true for one of the most 
prominent interpreters of Wittgenstein, Peter Hacker. In 
Insight and Illusion, for instance, he writes: “Scepticism is 
not to be answered by proving that we do know what the 
sceptic doubts, but rather by showing that the sceptical 
doubts make no sense.” (Hacker 1986: 208) The idea is 
this: If we cannot make sense of certain sceptical doubts 
then we may consider certain whatever the sceptic tried to 
challenge; and it is in deciding whether certain sceptical 
doubts make sense that criteria come into play. Someone 
may, therefore, answer the sceptic by proclaiming “This is 
what we call ‘a table, ‘being in pain’, etc.”. 
However, if we cannot make full sense of the sceptic, is 
it obvious that he or she must be wrong? Is anything 
shown to be certain, by remarking that the sceptic’s doubt 
are not fully intelligible to us? Cavell, who argues that 
there is a general misconception in secondary literature 
about what role criteria play, believes the answer to these 
questions to be “No”. Criteria, according to him, “are ‘crite-
ria for something’s being so’, not in the sense that they tell 
us of a thing’s existence, but of something like its identity, 
not of its being so, but of its being so.” (Cavell 1979: 45); 
and he goes on to say that “[t]his is enough for me to con-
clude that Wittgenstein's appeal to criteria […] is not, and 
is not meant to be, a refutation of skepticism.” (Cavell 
1979: 45) What then is the appeal to criteria supposed to 
achieve? 
“The philosophical appeal to what we say, and the 
search for our criteria on the basis of which we say 
what we say, are claims to community. And the claim to 
community is always a search for the basis upon which 
it can or has been established.” (Cavell 1979: 20)  
Thus, if Cavell is right, criteria are means to establish a 
community in the sense that my conviction, that such-and-
such is what we call ‘a table, ‘being in pain’, etc., is to be 
understood as that, which determines who we are; i.e. 
where the boundary between we and everyone else is to 
be drawn. Put differently: In expressing what I deem to be 
criteria I give voice to my understanding of things. Such an 
expression, however, may be objected to; rejected even.  
“I have nothing more to go on than my conviction, my 
sense that I make sense. It may prove to be the case 
that I am wrong, that my conviction isolates me, from all 
others, from myself.” (Cavell 1979: 20) 
This possibility is most strikingly demonstrated in Wittgen-
stein’s example of a child whom we give the instruction to 
add two and whose behaviour deviates in a bewildering 
way from what we would expect.  
“[N]ot only does he not receive me, because his natural 
reactions are not mine; but my own understanding is 
found to go no further than my own natural reactions 
bear it. I am thrown back upon myself: I as it were turn 
my palms outward, as if to exhibit the kind of creature I

am, and declare my ground occupied, only mine, ced-
ing yours.” (Cavell 1979: 115) 
A threat of isolation looms. I may find it impossible to make 
myself understood, to give words to what I want to say. 
And I take it, it is difficult to consider this a possibility and 
not feel unease. It is this disquieting possibility that the 
sceptic intends to bring out in the open.  
“If the fact that we share […] criteria is the condition un-
der which we can think and communicate in language, 
then skepticism is a natural possibility of that condition; 
it reveals most perfectly the standing threat to thought 
and communication, that they are […] nothing more 
than natural to us.” (Cavell 1979: 45) 
From all this it can be seen, that Cavell envisions a sceptic 
not about the existence of anything around us but about 
the possibility of thought and communication. And the 
gravity of Cavell’s suggestion can be seen particularly well 
in his response to Kripke’s thoughts on rules and rule fol-
lowing. 
3. Scepticism and rules 
As is well known, Kripke argues in Wittgenstein on Rules 
and Private Language that there is no (direct) answer to 
the question what rule I have been following in the past, 
when I calculated the sum of two numbers. 
“All [philosophical theories as to what the fact that I 
meant plus might consist in] fail to give a candidate […] 
that would show that only ‘125’, not ‘5’, is the answer I 
‘ought’ to give [in response to ‘68 + 57’].” (Kripke 1982: 
11) 
Hence, given that I am unable to produce a fact that would 
show what rule I have been following in the past, it seems 
possible that I am mistaken about what I meant at any time 
in the past. That is to say, it seems a possibility that when-
ever I believed to have formed a sensible thought I gave in 
to the illusion that I knew what (if any) thought that was. 
Kripke attempts to resolve the issue in a manner that is 
(and is intended to be) reminiscent of Hume’s solution to 
the problem of causality.  
“The ‘assertability conditions’ that license an individual 
to say that, on a given occasion, he ought to follow his 
rule this way rather than that, are, ultimately, that he 
does what he is inclined to do.” (Kripke 1982: 88f.) 
It is clear from this that a matching of inclinations is neces-
sary for communication to take place; i.e. it is only when 
we agree on a way to follow a rule that understanding be-
comes possible. For this reason it is central to Kripke’s 
account that “each person who claims to be following a 
rule can be checked by others.” (Kripke 1982: 101) Hardly 
surprising, Cavell finds this suggestions lacking. 
“If the matching of inclinations is all Wittgenstein’s 
teaching leaves us with, then I feel like asking: What 
kind of solution is that to a skeptical problem? […] This 
solution seems to me more skeptical than the problem it 
is designed to solve.” (Cavell 1988: 75) 
In a sense, Kripke provides an analysis of the sort of scep-
ticism Cavell sought to clarify. If our natural inclinations are 
what grounds thought and communication, surely they can 
be imagined to be different; and this is enough for the 
sceptic to gain ground. 
4. Isolation and morality 
Assuming all that has been said so far is right, we are fac-
ing a sceptical problem that has seldom received attention 
from Wittgenstein scholars. Why is that so? It is commonly 
thought that Wittgenstein held a view according to which 
reasoning must come to an end at some point; and 
Kripke’s sceptical solution to the rule following problem is 
generally considered to be such a point: There is nothing 
more to be said about the matter once we have reached 
the conclusion that no fact can show what I meant in the 
past by this-or-that word. The following passage from the 
Philosophical Investigations suggests itself: “Once I have 
exhausted the justifications, I have reached bedrock, and 
my spade is turned. Then I am inclined to say: ‘This is 
simply what I do.’” (PI, §217b) And indeed it seems we 
have reached bedrock. However, in a letter to Norman 
Malcolm Wittgenstein wrote: 
“[W]hat is the use of studying philosophy if all that it 
does for you is to enable you to talk with some plausibil-
ity about some abstruse questions of logic, etc., & if it 
does not improve your thinking about the important 
questions of everyday life.” (Letter to Norman Malcolm, 
taken from Von Wright 1984: 93) 
So even granting that there is a sense in which at some 
point we are unable to explain ourselves any further, the 
question may still be raised, how this insight may improve 
my (our) “thinking about the important questions of every-
day life”? To begin finding an answering to this question, it 
is important to note that the sceptical insight that there is 
no solid ground to support us when following a rule (even 
in a case as clear-cut as addition) is not to be considered 
an insight that could (or ought to) relieve us of our (phi-
losophical) disquietude. On the contrary, these words 
ought to be understood as an expression of profound un-
certainty; a terrifying possibility.  
“What remains here of first importance is that the skep-
tic's discovery […] repudiates or undercuts the validity 
of our criteria, our attunement with one another.” (Cav-
ell 1979: 46) 
The conclusion to be drawn from what has been said so 
far is something like this: Not only must we rely on others 
sharing our criteria but we have to exert ourselves in an 
effort to maintain attuned with each other, so that we will 
not stand isolated in what we take to be true, good, and 
beautiful. We may at some point give up on someone who 
does not come around to our (my) way of doing things, but 
it is far from clear when (if ever) that point is reached; and 
if we do, it is not merely the case that I dissociate myself 
from the other person. It is our (my) way of doing things 
that is called into doubt if I cannot make myself under-
stood. 
“In Wittgenstein's view the gap between mind and the 
world is closed, […] in the appreciation and acceptance 
of particular human forms of life. […] This implies that 
the sense of gap originates in an attempt, or wish, to 
escape […] those shared forms of life, to give up the 
responsibility of their maintenance.” (Cavell 1979: 109)  
If Cavell is right then the scepticism Wittgenstein is engag-
ing with in his Philosophical Investigations exposes a seri-
ous practical (moral) problem. 
Nothing is more human than the wish to deny one's 
humanity, or to assert it at the expense of others. But if 
that is what skepticism entails, it cannot be combated 
through simple “refutations”. (Cavell 1979: 109)

Sure enough, a more thorough analysis than I can provide 
within the confines of this paper is needed to clarify the 
exact sense in which the Philosophical Investigations are 
to be considered a work of ethics. It will have to suffice to 
point out what I consider a helpful starting point for such 
an analysis and it is this: The way in which Cavell renders 
Wittgenstein’s thoughts on scepticism in the Philosophical 
Investigations bears a striking resemblance to the views 
Harold Arthur Prichard expresses in “Does Moral Philoso-
phy Rest on a Mistake?”. Not only does Prichard make a 
claim about the root of moral philosophy that strikes me as 
an apt description of what Cavell calls “the wish to deny 
one’s humanity”: 
“Anyone who […] has come to feel the force of the vari-
ous obligations in life, at some time or other comes to 
feel the irksomeness of carrying them out, and to rec-
ognise the sacrifice of interest involved; and, if thought-
ful, he inevitably puts to himself the question ‘Is there 
really a reason why I should act in the ways in which 
hitherto I have thought I ought to act’?” (Prichard 1912: 
21); 
But also is Cavell’s denial of the possibility to refute the 
sceptic mirrored in Prichard assertion that “we do not come 
to appreciate an obligation by an argument” (Prichard 
1912: 29). With this in mind, “coming to an agreement 
about questions of morality” or “coming to share an under-
standing of what it is our duty to do in a given situation” 
may be understood as “participating in a shared attempt to 
maintain attuned with each other”. And hence it may be 
suggested that Wittgenstein considered the point of the 
Philosophical Investigations to be an ethical one, much in 
the sense that he thought the point of the Tractatus was: 
“[T]he content of the book will be strange to you. In real-
ity, it isn’t strange to you, for the point of the book is an 
ethical one.” (Letter to Ludwig von Ficker, taken from 
Janik & Gillette 1979: 94)

Wittgenstein’s Metaphilosophy:  
The Problem of General Misconceptions about Meaning 
Stefan Giesewetter 
Berlin, Germany | sgiesew@gmx.de 
Abstract 
In his recent Wittgenstein’s Metaphilosophy, Paul Horwich has advanced a view of later Wittgenstein centering on the claim that 
Wittgenstein’s discussion of meaning should be regarded as far less central than it usually is by Wittgenstein scholarship. He 
argues that Wittgenstein’s therapeutic philosophy does not rest on any particular account of meaning – especially not on a “use-
account” of meaning – but has its origin in his “deflationary”, anti-theoretical metaphilosophical viewpoint. However, in his expo-
sition of this methodology, Horwich is mentioning general misconceptions about meaning which impede our seeing differences 
in use – misconceptions he counters with statements of the form “meaning is use”. The question is: How does this fit with his 
view that Wittgenstein’s discussion of meaning is of no central relevance for his “metaphilosophy”? I will show how this dilemma 
can be avoided by reconsidering the role of remarks on the grammar of ‘meaning’ for the debunking of such misconceptions. 
 
 
In his recent book Wittgenstein’s Metaphilosophy, Paul 
Horwich has advanced a view of later Wittgenstein center-
ing on the claim that Wittgenstein’s discussion of meaning 
should be regarded as far less central than it usually is by 
Wittgenstein scholarship. As he argues, Wittgenstein’s 
therapeutic philosophical project does not rest on any par-
ticular account of meaning – especially not on a “use-
account” of meaning – but has its origin in his “deflation-
ary”, anti-theoretical metaphilosophical perspective. This 
view sees as the source of philosophical problems our un-
awareness of difference in use of the words involved – 
caused by linguistic analogies and scientistic overgenerali-
zation. Horwich argues that Wittgenstein’s treatment of 
meaning in the Investigations should be seen as “simply 
one application” (2012: x) of this general therapeutic 
methodology. 
Now already in his first exposition of this therapeutic 
methodology by way of an example, Horwich is mentioning 
general misconceptions about meaning which stand in the 
way of our coming to see such differences in use – mis-
conceptions which he counters with statements of the form 
“meaning is use”. The question I will be asking is: How 
does this fit with Horwich’s aim of showing that Wittgen-
stein’s discussion of meaning is of no central relevance for 
his general therapeutic methodology? In the following, I 
wish to show how this dilemma can be avoided by recon-
sidering the role of remarks on the grammar of ‘meaning’ 
for the debunking of such general misconceptions about 
meaning. 
I will start by giving a brief overview of how Horwich con-
ceives of Wittgenstein’s approach to philosophical prob-
lems in general. Next, I will present Horwich’s argument 
why “meaning is use” cannot be taken to be the basis of 
Wittgenstein’s “metaphilosophy”. I will then take a look at 
remarks of Horwich’s where he pits “meaning is use” 
against a certain misconception of meaning which he 
takes to have a bearing on Wittgenstein’s therapeutic ap-
proach in general. Lastly, I will show how the problem that 
Wittgenstein’s grammatical remark “meaning is use” might 
thus appear to play a general role which it shouldn’t play 
can be avoided. This, as I will argue, can be achieved by 
our coming to see that the idea that such general miscon-
ceptions about meaning can at all be debunked by gram-
matical remarks about ‘meaning’ is actually incoherent. 
Let us start with what Horwich has to say about Wittgen-
stein’s “metaphilosophy”. What Horwich means by this is 
Wittgenstein’s perspective on the source (and possible 
dissolution) of philosophical problems (cf. vii, ix-x). One 
great source of such problems, according to Horwich, is a 
prevailing tendency in philosophy to follow the model of 
science. “T-philosophy” (“T” as in “traditional” and “theo-
retical”, cf. 21) – is theoretical in the sense that, like sci-
ence, it seeks for simple regularities and fundamental prin-
ciples regarding a subject matter. This approach typically 
results in generalizations like “Numbers are objects”. How-
ever, such generalizations tend to clash with other, equally 
intuitive convictions about the matter like “Numbers don’t 
occupy positions in space and time”. The result is a phi-
losophical paradox of the form “How can numbers be 
genuine objects if they have no material constitution?” (cf. 
25-29) Now to Horwich, also T-philosophy’s typical reac-
tions to such paradoxes participate in forms of scientism – 
since what they typically resort to is the conclusion that 
many (or all) of our naive beliefs about a subject matter 
must be revised (cf. 29-50). But, according to Horwich, all 
these reactions fail to get to the real source of the philoso-
phical problem: by expecting that philosophy – like science 
– should deliver simple and unifying theories, we have 
been inclined to exaggerate the analogies between differ-
ent forms of use of words in our language. Horwich pre-
sents the dissolution of the case of numbers and other 
cases in an eight-stage schema, with the last stage being 
therapeutic dissolution. (cf. 50-61). 
Now one of Horwich’s key concerns is to argue against a 
certain way of taking Wittgenstein’s dictum that “meaning 
is use” to be fundamental to Wittgenstein’s treatment of 
philosophical problems: the claim that it follows from 
“meaning is use” that philosophy cannot revise our linguo-
conceptual practices, and hence cannot make the kind of 
discoveries which then give rise to philosophical theorizing. 
The argument in favor of this idea – which Horwich finds in 
Dummett, Katz, Pears, and Soames, among others (cf. 
2012: ix-x, 17, 69-70, 2004: 169) – is this: What it means 
to hold that meaning is use is that the totality of the uses 
we make of a word determines the meaning of the word. 
Now one use which we make of e.g. the word ‘number’ is 
that we use it in the sentence “Numbers are mind-
independent objects”. Given this, it will not possible for phi-
losophy to – as the result of an analysis of the meaning of 
‘number’ – announce the discovery that “numbers are not 
mind-independent”. For this would mean to change the 
use of ‘number’, and therefore the meaning of this word – 
rather than analyzing it. The upshot of this argument, then, 
is that no conceptual analysis in philosophy can ever entail 
a discovery that some of our common beliefs are wrong – 

Wittgenstein’s Metaphilosophy: The Problem of General Misconceptions about Meaning | Stefan Giesewetter 
 
 
 
107
which entails that any sort of theorizing based on such 
“discoveries” is misguided (cf. 2012: 69, 70, 2004: 169-70). 
Now according to Horwich, this kind of deriving a key 
element of Wittgenstein’s “metaphilosophy” from his 
statement that “meaning is use” is both unnecessary and 
badly flawed. It is badly flawed, as he argues, because it 
relies on an unacceptably radical form of holism. If the 
meaning of a word were determined by every single use 
that is commonly made of it, then the very idea that we 
might have been saying and thinking false things would be 
lost. According to Horwich, this is clearly not what Wittgen-
stein had in mind – rather, as he argues, he allowed for a 
distinction between meaning-constituting uses – the basic 
rules of a practice – and other uses which are the result of 
following those rules. Yet if this is admitted, Horwich con-
cludes, the whole argument linking “meaning is use” to 
Wittgenstein’s “metaphilosophy” breaks down (cf. 2012: 
71-2, 122-3, 2004: 170). 
Now for Horwich, not only is this way of deriving Witt-
genstein’s approach to philosophical problems from his 
statement that “meaning is use” mistaken, but any such 
way. This is, as he argues, because it is not necessary to 
assume “meaning is use” as a basis for Wittgenstein’s 
therapeutic enterprise (cf. 2012: 70). What Horwich takes 
to be behind Wittgenstein’s critique of philosophical “dis-
coveries” that seemingly call for philosophical theorizing is, 
not his identification of the meaning of a word with its use, 
but the insight in these problems being rooted in the exag-
geration of linguistic analogies. 
With this in mind, let us now take a look at Horwich’s 
subchapter “The Role of Language”. There, Horwich, via 
examples, gives a first introduction into the idea that it is 
the exaggeration of linguistic analogies which is at the 
source of many philosophical problems. As a preparatory 
step for this, Horwich introduces the idea how simplistic 
ideas about the use of certain words can produce the feel-
ing of paradox. The example he gives is that of a psy-
chologist announcing the discovery of ‘unconscious pain’. 
What we are inclined to assume is that she is using the 
word ‘pain’ in its basic ordinary sense, according to which 
we only apply it to what a person is aware of. This, accord-
ing to Horwich, produces the dilemma of either accepting a 
perplexing new fact about pain, or having to reject this new 
theory. However, as Horwich points out, this tension can 
be resolved through our realizing that by introducing this 
new feature of pain, the psychologist has actually changed 
the pattern of deployment of the word ‘pain’ in such a fun-
damental way that it would be wrong to assume that this is 
still the ordinary use of ‘pain’. The dilemma dissolves when 
we realize that the psychologist has done nothing more 
than introduce a different use of the word ‘pain’ (cf. 10-11). 
Now it is in the context of this example that Horwich says 
the following: 
[T]he source of confusion is not difficult to identify. As 
just illustrated, we tend to forget that the meaning of a 
word is something we bestow, not usually explicitly by 
means of a deliberate stipulation, but often implicitly, 
merely by using the word in certain ways; so that a 
change in its meaning does not require overt redefini-
tion, but may come about through a shift in its funda-
mental pattern of deployment. (10) 
The remedy, quite clearly, is not to be mesmerized by 
the word, but to appreciate how distinct uses of it, 
hence somewhat distinct meanings, may evolve and 
proliferate. (11) 
What Horwich started out to show with his example was 
how the assumption that the same word must always be 
used in the same way can be at the source of philosophi-
cal puzzlement. To this end, he pointed out how in his ex-
ample, what we are dealing with are changes – i.e. differ-
ences – in use of the word ‘pain’. But, in the passages 
quoted, Horwich is going one step further than this: He 
names as a source of confusion our ignorance of a general 
relation between the meaning of words and their use. 
 The problem I see with this is: How can Horwich recon-
cile this with his concern of showing that “meaning is use” 
should not be seen as basic or fundamental for Wittgen-
stein’s treatment of philosophical problems? For it appears 
that, given Horwich’s view that many philosophical prob-
lems have their origin in our unawareness of differences in 
use of the words involved, there is no reason to think that 
the fact about meaning whose ignorance he names as the 
source of confusion in his example shouldn’t be seen as 
the source of confusion in any problem of this kind. Yet if 
this were so, “meaning is use” would indeed have as-
sumed a fundamental relevance for Wittgenstein’s phi-
losophical perspective. 
To me, this dilemma points to an unclarity in Wittgen-
stein scholarship about the possible relation of the gram-
matical remark “meaning is use” to those misconceptions 
about meaning which are taken by Wittgenstein to have a 
bearing on his approach to philosophical problems in gen-
eral. One such misconception is mentioned by Wittgen-
stein in Investigations §117: 
You say to me: ‘You understand this expression, don’t 
you? Well then – I am using it in the sense you are fa-
miliar with.’ As if the sense were an atmosphere ac-
companying the word, which it carried with it into every 
kind of application. 
This idea has sometimes been called the “atmosphere 
conception” of meaning. And from the context of this re-
mark it seems clear that Wittgenstein thought this miscon-
ception to be linked to his question after actual uses of 
words – as one of the things that makes us, as philoso-
phers, not mind such actual uses of words. Now going 
back to Horwich’s example, it appears safe to say that 
whoever is adhering to this misconception will also not be 
apt to follow Horwich in minding how the psychologist’s 
talk of ‘unconscious pain’ results in a shift in the funda-
mental pattern of use of the word ‘pain’. In other words, it 
appears plausible to assume that what Horwich calls the 
state of being “mesmerized by the word” (11) is a form of 
adherence to the atmosphere conception. 
 Now as we have seen, what Horwich takes Wittgenstein 
to pit against the state of being mesmerized by the word is 
his grammatical remark that “meaning is use”. However, as 
I wish to show now, this idea actually isn’t as coherent as it 
may appear. To bring out this incoherence in the case of 
Horwich, let us first take a close look at a quote from his 
paper “Wittgenstein’s Meta-Philosophical Development” 
(2004). There, he states very clearly what he takes to be 
the import of viewing Wittgenstein’s metaphilosophical 
perspective as primary to his treatment of problems involv-
ing ‘meaning’. Horwich: 
From this metaphilosophical perspective the problems 
surrounding the phenomenon, X, must be treated by fo-
cusing on the special ways that the term ‘X’ is used. 
And applying that methodology to the phenomenon of 
meaning, we will see that words are said to have ‘the 
same meaning’ when their basic use is the same, and 
that a grasp of the meaning of a word is attributed to 
someone when he is able to use it appropriately. 
(2004: 171)

 108
This passage makes clear, as I take it, that Horwich sees 
“meaning is use” – a shorthand for insights like “words are 
said to have ‘the same meaning’ when their basic use is 
the same” – as a result of asking after actual uses of the 
word ‘meaning’. For instance, it is clear that the above in-
sight is the result of having attended to actual uses of the 
phrase ‘having the same meaning’. 
Now speaking on a general level, the reason why, in the 
light of this, I take it to be problematic to think that the at-
mosphere conception of meaning could be dispelled by 
such reminders of actual uses of the word ‘meaning’ is the 
following: On the one hand, we are reading “meaning is 
use” as an answer to the question after an actual use 
someone would make of the word ‘meaning’ – and on the 
other, we are taking the atmosphere conception of mean-
ing as something which makes us not mind such actual 
uses of words. The question is: would we of someone who 
has followed Horwich’s advice and considered actual uses 
of the phrase ‘having the same meaning’ – consequently 
realizing that this phrase is used in the case where the ba-
sic use of the words in question is the same – that he had 
been adhering to the atmosphere conception of meaning? 
It seems we would not – since we had taken this concep-
tion as making people not mind actual uses of words, yet 
here, someone did mind actual uses of a word – namely, 
‘meaning’. What this question shows, as I take it, is that 
the idea which we are discussing involves a regress struc-
ture: Grammatical reminders such as the one that we do 
not say of words that they ‘have the same meaning’ if their 
pattern of use is fundamentally different can effect the re-
sult which we had imagined for them to effect – freeing 
someone from the grip of the atmosphere conception of 
meaning – only if this result has already been achieved. 
Now what I take from this is that the dilemma which 
Horwich is facing actually isn’t a real one. If the idea that 
the state of being “mesmerized by the word” can at all be 
properly addressed by answers to the question “How 
would we actually use the word ‘meaning’?” is misguided, 
then the problem that Wittgenstein’s grammatical remark 
“The meaning of a word is its use in the language” might 
have a general role to play which on the other hand it 
shouldn’t play is avoided. As I further take from this, when 
it comes to removing someone from the grip of the atmos-
phere conception, we should draw the attention to the use 
of the expressions involved in the problem itself. Because 
if that doesn’t do the trick – as I hope to have shown – 
drawing attention to the use of the word ‘meaning’ won’t 
either.

The Schopenhauerian Background of the Tractatus 5.6-5.641 
Petr Glombíček 
Prague, Czech Republic | petr.glombicek@volny.cz  
Abstract 
The paper aims to reconstruct the argument of Tratatus 5.6-5.641 in the light of its Schopenhauerian background. It points out 
the Schopenhauerian sources of the relevant passages and explains how this background helps to understand the motivation 
and the structure of Wittgenstein’s line of thought. 
 
 
Schopenhauer’s influence on Wittgenstein is undisputed 
fact. We can find Schopenhauerian allusions all over Trac-
tatus and Notebooks 1914-16. Concerning the depth and 
extend of the influence there is still much to explore. In the 
following I shall concentrate on perhaps rather obvious 
example of Wittgenstein’s notion of subjectivity in Trac-
tatus as expressed in his commentary to Tractatus 5.6. 
This little exercise should help to make a further reaching 
point that we can understand Wittgenstein’s thought in 
Tractatus better if we bring its Schopenhauerian back-
ground to the light. 
Tractatus 5.6 with its commentary belongs to the most 
popular passages in Tractatus. Its point seems to be to 
outline a notion of ego, deal with problem of solipsism and 
show how to treat ego in philosophy. Wittgenstein starts 
with equating logic with the world considering the world as 
a realm of possibilities. Then suddenly comes the treat-
ment of subjectivity, obviously connnected for the author, 
nevertheless quite inexplicable from the text itself. 
The doctrine of ego is well known, although rather con-
fused. There is no ego in the world, hence we cannot 
speak about it, but the structure of the world shows it is 
conditioned by the ego. Solipsism is somehow right, but 
unspeakable, since there is no ego in the world and the 
language works as a medium for picturing the world affairs 
with the possibilities of states of the world being coexten-
sive with the possibilities of linguistic expressions. The ego 
makes its entrance into philosophy through the epiphany 
„The world is my world“. And since the world manifests 
itself as belonging to the ego, the ego constitues a valid 
topic for philosophy. 
In other words, the most puzzling aspect of the whole 
Tractatus 5.6 passage (including commentary) is the moti-
vation behind it. The whole shift from so called picture the-
ory of meaning to the mystical ending looks even more 
awkward on standard analytic reading. The situation could 
be quite different if we read the whole book through other, 
e.g. Schopenhauerian prism. The Tractatus 5.6 passage 
constitutes perfect choice, since it is inescapably obvious 
point of departure from matters of logic, truth functions etc. 
The logical apparatus occuping preceding pages disap-
pears in a blink and the very word „logic“ inconspicuously 
steps aside too. It all comes back suddenly in Tractatus 6. 
There is another reason to chose the section following 
Tractatus 5.6. It is overloaded with Schopenhauerian allu-
sions. 
The very beginning, Tractatus 5.6 „The limits of my lan-
guage mean limits of my world“ can be related to 
Schopenhauer’s dictum from Parerga: „Everyone regards 
the limits of his field of vision as those of the world.“ 
(Parerga and Paralipomena, §338, p. 601). This connec-
tion makes sense as the notorious picture showing what 
the field of vision does not look like can be found just few 
lines later in Tractatus 5.6331. In the immediately preced-
ing paragraph Tractatus 5.633 is the paralel introduced 
after Wittgenstein states that the metaphysical subject is 
nowhere to find. This very statement is usually understood 
as a Schopenhauerian allusion – instead of e.g. Humean 
one. The good reason for this can be seen in Wittgen-
stein’s holding the same dichotomy of phenomenal ang 
intelligible ego that Schopenhauer called the jewel in the 
crown of Kant’s philosophy and his sticking to understand-
ing of the intelligible ego as the willing subject. This willing 
subject is for Wittgenstein the bearer of the ethical – in the 
same way as it was for Schopenhauer and for Kant. Witt-
genstein also keeps the Schopenhauer’s side in distin-
guishing the willing subject from the perceiving or knowing 
subject. 
This is exactly the topic of the commentary to Tractatus 
5.6. In. Tractatus 5.633-5.6331 Wittgenstein compares the 
relation of the subject to the world with the relation of the 
eye and the visual field with the conclusion that the subject 
cannot be found in the world and nothing in the world im-
plies the existence of any perceiver. A full description of 
the world (the book called „The world as I found it“ as Witt-
genstein says) would not include any report on such sub-
ject. Nevertheless it would include a kind of reference to 
willing subject as it has to mention a subordination of cer-
tain parts of my body to my will. The whole commentary 
actually establishes the way to deal with ego and the dis-
tinction of knowing subject from the willing subject is cru-
cial for it. Whereas the knowing subject is the eye which is 
never seen itself, the willing subject enters the world 
through its acts. 
When we look at the passages where Schopenhauer 
deals with the problem of solipsism, we find immediate 
connection to ethics. Schopenhauer interprets solipsism as 
„theoretical egoism“ based on „practical egoism“ (The 
World as Will and Idea II, §19). Solipsism is simply the 
outcome of the idea that I am something special and the 
existence of everything else (including other persons) is 
somehow derivative. Distancing oneself from the others in 
practical respect leads to giving oneself special ontological 
status. By the way, related passages give as more textual 
evidence for his traces in Tractatus, when Schopenhauer 
uses the contrast microcosm/macrocosm to explain the 
relation of the subject to the world (The World as Will and 
Idea II, §29) and when he sarcastically comments on the 
fact that we regard our own death as the end of the world, 
whereas the deaths of others we usually consider rather 
indifferently (The World as Will and Idea IV, §61). Wittgen-
stein’s use of the word „microcosm“ in Tratcatus 5.63 
seems to be obvious Schopenhauerian allusion as the oc-
curence of the expression is rather rare and surprising in 
his vocabulary, especially as the idea of one’s own death 
as the end of the world appears little later in Tractatus 
6.431-6.4311

Schopenhauerian inspiration: the idea of the riddle of life 
unanswarable by scientific inquiry after the theme of willing 
subject and limits of the world makes its comeback in Trac-
tatus 6.43. Last pages of Tratatus are notoriously filled 
with Schopenhaurian themes as Wittgenstein comes back 
to subject he knew first and foremost from Schopenhauer: 
ethics. The closing of Tractatus deals not only with tran-
scendental willing subject in particular, but also with the 
idea of the different world of the happy person and the un-
happy one, the idea of ethical punishment and reward 
connected with the commanding voice, it identifies ethics 
with aesthetics, the rare Latin phrase „sub specie aeterni“ 
coming probably from Schopenhauer’s quotation of 
Spinoza occures here as well as the most famous allegory 
of the ladder. All these have been documented as 
Schopenhauerian inspirations. 
We have good reasons to read Tractatus in Schopen-
hauerian context. Let us come back to the commentry to 
Tractatus 5.6. It starts with the idea of language covering 
the world proceding from previous considerations with the 
shift towards the subjectivity adding „my“ to both the lan-
guage and the world. And it ends in 5.641 with establishing 
the way how to talk in philosophy about ego. The ego, as 
we are reminded, is not the empirical ego, but the tran-
scendental one: the metaphysical limit of the world. As we 
know this was the only ego that Wittgenstein found inter-
esting: the bearer of the property of moral goodness in 
kant-schopenhauerian tradition. The possibility to talk 
about this ego is established by the fact that „the world is 
my world“ (Tractatus 6.431). How does Wittgenstein reach 
this rather surprising conclusion – which is moreover in 
appaling contrast to the idea that one must pass transcen-
dental matters over in silence? 
The idea of silence is proposed already at the beginning 
of the argument in 5.61. Once we understand language as 
a systém of signs for picturing the contingent states of af-
fairs in the world, we see that such language does not 
permit any talk about anything transcending the world. The 
matter was initially complicated by the fact that there are 
combinations of linguistic signs that make an impression of 
sentences concerning matters behind the limit. But at this 
point we already know that proper logical analysis un-
masks these expressions as void of sense – they express 
no thought. (By the way this idea including the allegory of 
language as clothing of the thought also occurs in The 
World as Will and the Idea, cf. Appendix, pp. 507f.). Hence 
we do not succumb to the misleading impression. 
And here comes the strike. This outcome is not used to 
ridicule speculative doctrine of solipsism, but to show that 
there is certain truth in it. To understand it one has to dis-
tinguish the meaning of the sentence from the speaker’s 
meaning. The solipsistic doctrine may use nonsensical 
sentences, but the solipsist nevertheless means some-
thing by them. He makes the mistake of trying to put into 
words something that belongs to the other semantical ca-
togory – the showing. What he aims to say by his sen-
tences could be properly showed by different and quite 
legitimate sentences. The truth of solipsism which strictly 
should be only showed is still explicitly stated by Wittgen-
stein in Tractatus 5.61: The world is my world. 
The discreet shift from in 5.6 gets its explanation in the 
last paragraph of 5.61. The solipsist’s truth comes exactly 
from the fact that language covers all possiblities of the 
states of affairs in the world, just when one does not re-
gard the language as an abstract system of signs, but as 
an idiolect in which those signs are loaded with meaning 
the speaker sees in them. The language as used by par-
ticular speaker still covers all possible states of affairs. It is 
an essential feature. But with variety of idiolects comes 
variety of worlds: „The world and life are one,“ and „I am 
my world (microcosmos).“ Both these sentences closing 
the first part of Wittgenstein’s argument concerning subjec-
tivity have Schopenhauerian origin. The later comes from 
above mentioned passages. The earlier comes from The 
World as the Will and the Idea II, §54, p. 301 where 
Schopenhauer explains what he means by will to life. The 
willing subject undestands its own nature through the 
world of representations. 
Wittgenstein does not here acknowledges explicitly that 
the subject emerging from this line of thought is the willing 
subject. Although he did so in Notebooks. And his reader 
can easily miss his point, especially without getting the 
Schopenhauerian reference. The original occurence of the 
following sentence which opens (possibly with 5.63) the 
second part of the argument in Tractatus 5.631: „There is 
no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertain ideas,“ 
had a little addendum: „But the willing subject exists.“ 
(Notebooks 1914-16, 5. August 1916, p. 80). Supposedly 
this addendum should had been clear from the context in 
Tractatus. And the second part of the argument only ex-
plains that the subject established by the first part is not 
the thinking subject (but only the willing one). Here comes 
the time to entertain the classical Schopenahauerian no-
tion of the thinking subject as the invisible eye. The only 
way the subject is given is through the fact that some parts 
of my body obey my will. The solipsism is brought back 
only to show that from purely epistemic perspective this 
doctrine coincides with realism. Just before that the reader 
is also reminded of the starting point of the picture theory: 
every state of affairs in the world is contingent, hence 
there is no place for metaphysical subject in the world. The 
Schopenhauerian idea that the world is coextensive with 
the visual field works perfectly here. 
How come then that the philsophy can talk about ego in 
non-psychological way according to Tractatus? When 
Wittgenstein uses the word „philosophy“ it is often hard to 
tell whether he means traditional philosophy or the thinking 
overcoming the traditional problems. Thankfully it works 
both ways here. The solipsistic temptation comes from 
something right: The world is my world. And the Wittgen-
steinian ideal philosophy speaking only in the language of 
natural science could still treat the subject in sentences 
showing that the world is my world.

Abstract 
I discuss David Chalmers’ proposed way of modelling the notion of conceivability and some of his connected remarks about 
modal knowledge in general and the viability of conceivability arguments in particular. After an initial evaluation of Chalmers’ 
basic model, I offer a few possible improvements drawing on considerations on a web of interrelated notions such as meaning, 
imagination and abstraction. Subsequently, putting the new model to the test, I apply it to Chalmers’ own well-known 
conceivability argument concerning the possibility of physically perfect duplicates of human beings which somehow “lack” 
consciousness (the so-called ‘zombie argument’). I conclude by reflecting on the broader question of the usefulness of 
constructing models for our understanding of complex philosophical notions such as ‘conceivability’, drawing on some ideas by 
later Wittgenstein. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
This paper contributes to a discussion about the notion of 
conceivability. Confusion and disagreement appear to be 
prevalent with regard to the basic role of conceivability in 
philosophical arguments. An improved epistemological 
understanding of this notion would seem to be a promising 
way to enhance the understanding of salient arguments in 
various areas of philosophy. 
I focus on David Chalmers’ model of conceivability. I first 
offer some constructive criticism, then suggest a few modi-
fications myself, and finally demonstrate the extended 
model’s usefulness in application to Chalmers’ own fa-
mous argument from the conceivability of ‘physically per-
fect duplicates of human beings which somehow “lack” 
consciousness’ (the so-called ‘zombie argument’). 
Although nowadays the conceivability of ‘physically per-
fect duplicates of human beings which somehow “lack” 
consciousness’ appears to be widely accepted even by 
physicalists, I believe one should not accept this premise. 
The extended model of conceivability will assist me in 
specifying my reasons for not accepting this basic epis-
temic premise. These reasons will be seen to be different 
from reasons given by most other commentators. The 
model will also be helpful in formulating a clear challenge 
to Chalmers. 
2. Chalmers’ model of conceivability 
The most straightforward, and probably most significant, 
instance of Chalmers’ application of his model and its vari-
ous distinctions, consists in his classifying the use he 
wishes to make of the term ‘conceivable’ (and ‘possible’) in 
his famous argument from the conceivability of ‘physically 
perfect duplicates of human beings that somehow “lack” 
consciousness’. The relevant distinctions that constitute 
Chalmers’ model of conceivability can be seen in the way 
he refines the argument. Here is a simplified schematic 
version, where ‘P’ stands for ‘the conjunction of physical 
truths about the world’ (Chalmers 2002:196) and ‘Q’ for the 
‘phenomenal 
truth 
[that] 
“someone 
is 
conscious”’ 
(Chalmers 2002:196), with the inserted distinctions in ital-
ics: 
1. P and not-Q is ideally primarily positively conceivable. 
2. If P and not-Q is ideally primarily positively conceiv-
able, then P and not-Q is primarily possible. 
3. If P and not-Q is primarily possible, physicalism is 
false. 
________________ 
4. Physicalism is false. 
Ideal conceivability vs. prima facie conceivability 
In contrast to what gets classified as prima (secunda, ter-
tia, quarta, etc.) facie conceivable, what gets classified as 
ideally conceivable is something that cannot turn out to be 
not conceivable, or alternatively, something that is, in 
Chalmers’ words, conceivable ‘on ideal rational reflection’ 
(2002:147). Yablo illustrates what the distinction might 
amount to by giving an example of non-ideal conceivability 
from philosophical experience: ‘At one time … I suppose I 
found it conceivable that there should be a town whose 
resident barber shaved all and only the town’s non-self-
shavers’ (Yablo 1993:35). 
Primary conceivability vs. secondary conceivability 
What gets classified as primarily conceivable is something 
that could actually be the case, or that could be found to 
be the case in our actual world as we know it. What gets 
classified as secondarily conceivable, on the other hand, is 
something that could have been the case had our world 
turned out to be different. For example, if someone’s claim 
that they could conceive of a cow jumping over the moon 
can be defeated by reminding them of such worldly facts 
as a cow’s average weight and the laws of gravity, then 
the kind of conceivability in question should be classified 
as primary conceivability in Chalmers’ model. If not, i.e. if 
the claim cannot be defeated by citing facts about our 
world, then we should probably classify it as secondary 
conceivability. 
Positive conceivability vs. negative conceivability 
What gets classified as negatively conceivable is some-
thing where, roughly, (a priori) nothing speaks against its 
conceivability. What gets classified as positively conceiv-
able, on the other hand, is something where some sort of 
story, reason, or evidence is provided in support of the 
conceivability of that which is held to be conceivable. Pos-
sible examples include Descartes’ ‘evil demon’ and Put-
nam’s ‘brain in a vat’.

3. Chalmers’ model extended 
There are two features of Chalmers’ model of conceivabil-
ity which are problematic in that they are tendentious. 
Firstly, Chalmers seems to set the bar too low for ‘(ideal) 
negative conceivability’ by overplaying the significance of 
(logical) contradiction and dismissing all other means of 
defeating what gets classified as ideal negative conceiv-
ability as irrelevant and ‘tangential to our main purposes’ 
(2002:149). Secondly and relatedly, Chalmers seems to 
disassociate conceivability and possibility too strictly. 
Without further argument, due to limitations of space, I can 
here only mention the connected danger that we are thus 
potentially misled into all too easily lowering our critical 
standards for what we are inclined to call ‘conceivable’, 
and hence for believing in the possibility of something we 
might hardly be able to form a coherent conception of. 
Chalmers indirectly suggests that one should be com-
pelled to believe in something’s possibility simply because 
one cannot present a clear and distinct (a priori) contradic-
tion of the conceivability statement in question. But, if 
taken seriously, such a suggestion would lead to the most 
un-critical, hence un-philosophical, practice of one’s intel-
lectual powers. Insofar as these problems spring from in-
ternal features of Chalmers’ model of conceivability, modi-
fication seems to be called for. 
Chalmers writes that ‘[c]lear cases of prima facie positive 
conceivability without ideal positive conceivability are sur-
prisingly hard to come by’ (2002:154). However, this may 
depend on one’s individual critical abilities and inclinations. 
I for one think that the contrary is true. ‘Prima facie positive 
conceivability without ideal positive conceivability’ would 
seem an appropriate description of a common feature of 
philosophical dialogue, for instance. It regularly happens 
that one person believes they have pointed out that some-
thing is conceivable (e.g. ‘Hesperus ≠ Phosphorus’) and 
another demonstrates that it is not, or at any rate not 
clearly so. A spiral-like dialectic of specifications and re-
finements of what is supposedly conceivable then normally 
ensues. In the end, hopefully, the two agree, but it is often 
not clear whether what has eventually been agreed to be 
conceivable is actually what was initially claimed to be 
conceivable. One way of describing such dialogues would 
be in terms of the indeterminacy of the original statement. 
Conceivability/inconceivability vs. undecidability 
There are various ways of defeating a claim of (positive) 
conceivability. Chalmers’ strong focus on contradiction—
whether understood in a broad sense or in a narrow (logi-
cal) one—is a theoretical simplification which, in practice, 
can easily lead to either the false denial of the variety of 
defeaters of conceivability claims (broad sense) or its mis-
representation (narrow sense). 
One way to defeat a claim of (positive) conceivability 
consists in pointing out the undecidability of a particular 
imagined situation with regard to its conceivability or in-
conceivability. As Yablo correctly notes, ‘for some values 
of p [the intended expression of a hypothetical state of af-
fairs], worlds in which p is clearly true are not clearly imag-
inable, or, what comes to the same, in clearly imaginable 
worlds 
p’s 
truth-value 
seems 
somehow 
uncertain’ 
(1993:31). In other words, someone’s expression of a hy-
pothetical state of affairs whose conceivability they want to 
argue for may simply not be determinate enough for us to 
decide whether we want to say that it is conceivable or that 
it is not. 
Consider, for example, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg’s 
‘handleless knife without a blade’ (‘Ein Messer ohne Klin-
ge, an welchem der Stiehl fehlt’ (Lichtenberg 1798:452)). 
In such a case, what we are presented with may at first 
sound conceivable, and hence be classified as prima facie 
conceivable. It might also be classified as secunda and 
tertia conceivable. And yet it may be held to be not even 
possibly classifiable as ideally conceivable. For the follow-
ing simple reason: if the object whose conceivability is un-
der question is indeterminate with respect to at least two 
different possibilities of what could be meant, then only the 
person whose claim is under consideration could help de-
termine the sense. 
In the case of ‘the handleless knife without a blade’ 
someone could plausibly argue for its conceivability as fol-
lows, viz. presenting a sensible story in which Lichten-
berg’s expression is not paradoxical at all: someone in a 
fight might lose the handle of their knife but continue by 
grabbing the wooden stub on the end of the blade, only for 
the blade to break off; legend may have it that the fighter 
still won, defeating their enemy with a handleless knife 
without a blade. 
Prior to the specification of what was meant in the first 
place, therefore, one would have to withhold one’s judge-
ment (cf. Yablo on a similar example: ‘[it] is not conceiv-
able for him; but neither is it inconceivable, for he can 
imagine worlds which he is unready to describe as ones in 
which the proposition is false’ (1993:31)). In principle, 
however, the person first giving expression to a claim of 
something’s (positive) conceivability may not be able to 
specify what they meant or simply not care to think about it 
any further. This is the reason why, in such a case, not 
even an omniscient God could decide whether what is un-
der question regarding its conceivability is or is not con-
ceivable. And this is where Chalmers’ rationalist idealisa-
tion appears to reach its mundane limits. 
Hence, as I have just argued, the category of potential 
defeaters of conceivability claims in our model should 
comprise more than merely ‘contradiction’. More specifi-
cally, I want to add the indeterminacy of the statement (ex-
pression) of whatever is (intended to be) claimed to be 
conceivable. As a consequence, besides (ideal) conceiv-
ability and (ideal) inconceivability we should introduce a 
third category which corresponds to the indeterminacy of a 
conceivability claim: ‘undecidability’. The question of con-
nected changes to the model’s combinatorics is rather 
straightforward. Most importantly perhaps, it should be 
noted that in the extended version of the model some-
thing’s x-facie conceivability can be compatible with its 
ideal undecidability. 
Introspective conceivability vs. extrospective conceiv-
ability 
We have been considering conceivability at a certain level 
of abstraction and generality, in accordance with our inter-
est in seeing whether there is a philosophically substantial 
notion of conceivability to be attained by means of con-
structing an artificial model, taking into account relevant 
differences in the use we make of it in normal speech. It 
may thus appear almost trivial to note that all along we 
have also abstracted as best we could from our own case. 
I.e. our philosophical enquiries were not limited to what 
any one of us may believe we can conceive. Our enquiries 
were not directed at any one person’s capacities of imagi-
nation, etc. But our enquiries were directed at our shared 
concept of conceivability, as one might put it. 

On Intuiting, Imagining and Introspecting in Philosophy | Sebastian Greve 
 
 
 
113
It is curious, however, that when we are discussing the 
conceivability of a particular state of affairs as stated in a 
philosophical argument, we usually tend to introspect 
rather than abstracting in the way just described. There 
seems to be a strong tendency to ask ourselves ‘Can I 
conceive of this?’. But, considering the distinction between 
x-facie conceivability and ideal conceivability (the latter 
understood as denoting the aspiration of philosophers), the 
following should be clear. While one of the weakest kinds 
of prima facie conceivability is the one where one person, 
by introspection, comes to believe that something is con-
ceivable, perhaps the strongest attainable claim of some-
thing’s conceivability may be described as ideal (positive) 
conceivability which is partly constituted by an investiga-
tion of our shared conceptual framework as it pertains to 
the relevant conceivability claim. 
Hence, when considering the conceivability of something 
in philosophy, instead of asking ourselves introspectively 
‘Can I conceive of this?’, we would do better, in an effort to 
abstract from our own cognitive capacities, to ask the fol-
lowing more reflective question: what would it mean for 
someone to be able to conceive of this?, or: under what 
circumstances would we say of someone that they are 
able to conceive of this? Thus it would seem another ap-
propriate extension of Chalmers’ model to add a distinction 
between what we might call ‘introspective conceivability’ 
and ‘extrospective conceivability’. 
4. Applying the extended model 
Applying the extended model of conceivability, I argue 
that, for Chalmers’ famous conceivability argument to be 
more compelling, a more accurate classification of its basic 
epistemic premise would have to make use of the distinc-
tion between introspective conceivability and extrospective 
conceivability, as follows: 
5. P and not-Q is ideally primarily positively extrospec-
tively conceivable. 
Accordingly, when evaluating Chalmers’ first premise we 
would now have to ask ourselves, among other questions: 
under what circumstances would we say of someone that 
they are able to (ideally primarily positively) conceive of P 
and not-Q? Or, more explicitly: under what circumstances 
would we say of someone that they are able to (ideally 
primarily positively) conceive of ‘physically perfect dupli-
cates of human beings which somehow “lack” conscious-
ness’? 
Generally, the distinction helps transfer the critical-
reflective attitude towards the notion of conceivability to 
questions which in one way or another employ the notion. 
More specifically, such increased critical-reflective aware-
ness helps ensure greater care and thoroughness when 
considering delicate questions of conceivability. Finally, 
when asked to consider the relevant abilities to conceive of 
anyone, in abstraction from our own case, we are simulta-
neously asked to imagine scenarios that are far more con-
crete. 
In the case of Chalmers’ famous argument, for instance, 
being asked to imagine concrete circumstances under 
which we would say of someone that they are able to con-
ceive of ‘physically perfect duplicates of human beings 
which somehow “lack” consciousness’, we are reminded of 
the following. First, in accordance with Chalmers’ classifi-
cation of ideal primarily positive conceivability, we should 
imagine a person, or series of persons, in a world which as 
far as we know is ours (‘primary conceivability’), thus at-
tempting to satisfy the condition of physically perfect dupli-
cation. Furthermore, secondly, we are asked to imagine a 
situation in which any particular person is maximally com-
petent with regards to the particular question of conceiv-
ability (‘ideal conceivability’). Therefore, given that it is a 
human being whose physically perfect duplication and 
“lack” (in some sense) of consciousness is to be decided 
upon, we should here think of a specimen particularly well-
known to the subject, e.g. their best friend. 
Thus, the concrete situation we are asked to imagine in 
evaluating the first premise of Chalmers’ argument be-
comes something like the following: our subject person sits 
at a table with their beloved object person (e.g. their best 
friend). They have been talking about quotidian matters 
like work, colleagues and bosses, but equally about more 
personal issues, love and the value of society. They have 
been laughing a lot, etc., etc. —— Now, at some point in 
the meta-narrative the story itself will have to take a turn. 
Our subject person will have to be presented as somehow 
thinking to themselves, exclaiming or expressing by other 
means that they can conceive of their beloved object per-
son as ‘somehow (nevertheless genuinely) “lacking” con-
sciousness’. 
I admit that my imagination leaves me in the lurch here. I 
can of course imagine A uttering the words ‘B, you lack 
consciousness’, or thinking to herself that B ‘lacks con-
sciousness’. But then it seems to me that either the story 
must have developed to a point where B is contingently 
unconscious (viz. B being drunk, asleep, sleepwalking, 
narcotised, comatose, perhaps amnesiac) or where A is 
making an incorrect judgement or acting insanely. 
Hence the following challenge arises for Chalmers, or 
indeed anyone else: to expand on something like this ba-
sic story so as to make us say: ‘Yes, I would call that “A 
being able to (ideally primarily positively) conceive of B as 
‘“lacking” consciousness’” in the required sense (i.e. as 
opposed to, say, “being drugged”).’ But for the time being, 
as long as our story remains essentially incomplete, we 
should not be blinded by the supposed intuitiveness of the 
alleged conceivability of ‘physically perfect duplicates of 
human beings which somehow “lack” consciousness’. 
Using the extended model of conceivability, we are in a 
position to specify in greater detail what would be required 
in order to argue successfully for what is hence to be clas-
sified as the ideal primary positive extrospective conceiv-
ability of ‘physically perfect duplicates of human beings 
which somehow “lack” consciousness’. Given the current 
absence of a convincing story—in other words, given the 
essential indeterminacy of the expression that has been 
given to that whose conceivability is supposedly under 
question—our verdict must be that it is undecidable. 
5. Conclusion 
I hope to have demonstrated how constructing a model of 
conceivability can be instrumental in enhancing our under-
standing of this epistemic notion that is so central to a 
large number of philosophical arguments. In concluding 
this paper, I want to briefly address a more general issue 
about the construction of artificial models in philosophy. 
I have pointed out several problems with Chalmers’ 
original model. I also mentioned Chalmers’ narrow focus 
on (logical) contradiction as a defeater of conceivability 
claims and his strong separation of ‘conceivability’ and 
‘possibility’. I indicated that both these features have the 
problematic tendency of reducing critical awareness on the 
part of the model user. Yet, Chalmers’ model may be basi-
cally sound except for a more general problem concerning

what seems to be a common danger when working with 
artificial models in philosophy that I shall now outline. 
For instance, Yablo writes: ‘The reason why some can 
conceive a barber who shaves all and only the non-self-
shavers, while others find this inconceivable, is that the 
first group needs to learn more logic’ (1993:39–40). Yablo 
implies that it is in fact not conceivable. I disagree. If the 
implicit presumption is that the phrase ‘all and only the 
non-self-shavers’ includes the barber in question himself, 
then surely Yablo is correct. But this presumption is just 
one commonly made in the study of logical systems. Yet it 
need not be entailed by just any use of these words, at 
least not in ordinary parlance. A ‘barber’, when considered 
in his professional capacity, might just naturally be as-
sumed not to belong to the relevant set of those he may or 
may not shave. 
Reflecting on this instance, Yablo could be said to be 
applying the model of logic not for what it is, a model, but 
as though it were the thing itself (cf. PI §§130-131). This is 
the fundamental danger. In working with models it can be 
immensely difficult to keep a clear view of the differences 
between our model on the one hand and its respective 
subjects and objects on the other. Since in philosophy we 
almost never seem to be able to reconstruct whatever we 
are modelling, it is almost always a mistake to assume 
such identity. However the truth is: the better we model the 
greater the danger of analogical thinking. Perhaps the fol-
lowing can be helpful. On the one hand, we construct the 
model based on the respective object of our interest (e.g. 
‘conceivability’). This may be called the object of our 
model. On the other hand, we construct the model for the 
respective object of our interest (e.g. ‘conceivability of x’). 
This may be called the subject of our model (i.e. the par-
ticular instance we may wish to apply our model to). 
Hence, in order to make sure we do not confuse the 
model and the real thing, we should probably set up re-
minders here and there. For example, instead of using el-
liptical formulations such as ‘what gets classified as ideally 
conceivable is something that cannot turn out to be not 
conceivable’, I could have used phrases of the following 
sort: ‘what gets classified as ideally conceivable is thereby 
represented in our model as a statement representing 
whatever the speaker holds to be conceivable as some-
thing that cannot, etc.’. This admittedly being quite a 
mouthful, we also see that one problem with setting up 
reminders is that even in philosophy reflection can seem 
out of place (or, space: words). 
Nonetheless, acknowledging the model for what it is (or, 
at least for what it is not, viz. the real thing) will also assist 
us in making sure we get the most out of the models we 
have, e.g. Chalmers’ model. For it is not primarily through 
similarities that we can come to improve our understanding 
of whatever our philosophical enquiries may be directed at, 
but ‘through similarities and dissimilarities’ (PI §130).

The Resemblance Between a Philosophical Investigation, an 
Aesthetic one and Psychoanalysis 
Elinor Hallen 
Uppsala, Sweden | elinor.hallen@filosofi.uu.se  
Abstract 
In this paper I will address the affinity of aims and methods between Wittgenstein’s philosophy and Freud’s psychoanalytic ther-
apy. More specifically, how Freud’s practice accords with what Wittgenstein characterizes as an aesthetic investigation and 
takes to be essential to philosophical practice. Wittgenstein talks of the three activities – the philosophical, the aesthetic and the 
psychoanalytical – as sharing characteristics and as able to shed light on each other and he often uses analogies to aesthetic 
activities or investigation as well as images to show the affinity between philosophy and psychoanalysis. Some of these I will 
present in this paper. 
 
 
Wittgenstein, who had earlier thought psychology was a 
waste of time, read Freud and found that “here was some-
one who had something to say”. He sometimes spoke of 
himself as “a disciple of Freud” but he wasn’t an uncritical 
disciple. On many points he found that Freud was wrong 
and that his theories were muddled, even harmful. (2007, 
p. 41) In this paper I will focus on Freud’s practice rather 
than theory, this is where we find great affinity between the 
two.  
What makes psychoanalysis different from psychology? 
Wittgenstein characterizes an aesthetic investigation and 
distinguishes it from a psychological. 
Aesthetics is descriptive. What it does is to draw one’s 
attention to certain features, to place things side by side so 
as to exhibit these features. […] Our attention is drawn to a 
certain feature and from that point forward we see that fea-
ture. […] If one gave psychological reasons for choosing a 
simile, those would not be reasons in aesthetics. They 
would be causes. (2001, pp. 38) 
Aesthetics shares its descriptive nature with philosophy, 
as Wittgenstein says in The Blue Book “it can never be our 
job to reduce anything to anything, or to explain anything. 
Philosophy really is ‘purely descriptive’” (1958, p. 18). The 
main point of difference between psychology and aesthet-
ics is that in psychology we are interested in causal con-
nections but in aesthetics we are not. When we ask why a 
painting is beautiful an answer in terms of a cause would 
not “remove the aesthetic puzzle”. (2001, p. 38) It is by 
giving descriptions of the painting that we can come to 
know better why we find it beautiful. The aesthetic investi-
gation is descriptive and it aims at understanding.  
In several places Wittgenstein likens psychoanalytic 
practice to an aesthetic investigation. This is an example 
where he states this clearly 
When we laugh without knowing why, Freud claims that 
by psychoanalysis we can find out. I see a muddle here 
between a cause and a reason. Being clear why you 
laugh is not being clear about a cause. If it were, then 
agreement to the analysis given of the joke explaining 
why you laugh would not be a means of detecting it. 
The success of the analysis is supposed to be shown 
by the person’s agreement. There is nothing corre-
sponding to this in physics. […] The psychoanalytic way 
of finding why a person laughs is analogous to an aes-
thetic investigation. (2001, pp. 39) 
Wittgenstein characterizes the nature of his own philoso-
phical work by analogies to aesthetic activities. “When I 
have had a picture suitably framed or have hung it in the 
right surroundings I have often caught myself being as 
proud as though I had painted the picture” or “as proud as 
[…] though I had so to say painted a little bit of it”. But as 
Wittgenstein says, it ought to be clear that the work per-
formed “lies in a different region altogether” (1998, p. 17e), 
namely in placing the painting in a context in which it fits 
perfectly, or within a frame that enhances the quality of the 
painting. This has nothing to do with how the painting 
comes into being and it doesn’t change the object as such 
but it matters for how the painting is perceived and thus for 
the meaning and qualities one takes it to have. Wittgen-
stein further develops wherein the strengths and limitations 
of this kind of work lies. He describes it, troublesomely 
perhaps, as the work of a Jewish mind. I will not discuss 
this description but the remarks in which it appears, where 
Wittgenstein makes thought-provoking characterizations of 
his work and its resemblance to psychoanalysis. 
It might be said (rightly or wrongly) that the Jewish mind 
is not in a position to produce even so much as a tiny 
blade of grass or flower but that its way is to make a draw-
ing of the blade of grass or the flower that has grown in the 
mind of another & then use it to sketch a comprehensive 
picture. […]  
It is typical of the Jewish mind to understand someone 
else’s work better than he understands it himself. (1998, p. 
17e) 
The talent described here lies not in production but in 
comprehension and communication; in arrangement of 
thoughts and in creating comprehensive pictures and 
comparisons. 
I think there is some truth in my idea that I am really only 
reproductive in my thinking. I think I have never invented a 
line of thinking but that it was always provided for me by 
someone else & I have done no more than passionately 
take it up for my work of clarification. […] Can one take 
Breuer & Freud as an example of Jewish reproductive 
thinking? – What I invent are new comparisons. (1998, p. 
16e) 
Does the characterization fit? Quite well, I think. For the 
therapist it is a virtue if not a requirement that he under-
stand some of his patient’s reactions, utterances and mo-
ments of silence better than she does herself since these 
are outer manifestations of the psychological problems 
that he is to help the patient acknowledge, understand and 
free herself from. It would be fatal if the therapist invented

a story and convinced the patient that it was the real cause 
of her trauma. Rather, he should help her to clarify her own 
interpretations. 
The philosopher who is troubled by not knowing his way 
about in language is helped by accomplishing what Witt-
genstein calls a perspicuous representation. In PI §122 
Wittgenstein writes 
A main source of our failure to understand is that we do 
not command a clear view of the use of our words. – 
Our grammar is lacking in this sort of perspicuity. A 
perspicuous representation produces just that under-
standing that consists in ‘seeing connections’.  
Wittgenstein has linguistic phenomena and grammatical 
problems in mind but if we take his referral to Freudian 
psychoanalysis as an aesthetic investigation seriously and 
are attentive to the similarity in situation of the philosopher 
at loss and the person who seeks therapy, we might well 
reflect on the work of the therapist in light of this passage. 
While Wittgenstein is trying to make the troubled philoso-
pher see conceptual connections, the therapist will try to 
make the patient see that she reacts with similar behav-
ioral and emotional response in a number of situations. He 
will encourage the patient to reflect upon what connects 
these situations, and further if her reactions can be traced 
back to a common origin. The analyst is trying to repro-
duce the conflict and this can only be done by bringing 
some order to the muddle of reactions that are acted out in 
therapy together with the patient’s interpretations of them 
by arranging these in a way that can help the patient per-
ceive her situation in a new way. 
In PI §123 Wittgenstein writes, “A philosophical problem 
has the form ‘I don’t know my way about’”. We recognize 
this as the situation of the patient in therapy: she doesn’t 
know how to deal with her problems nor quite what they 
are and seeks therapy to gain a better understanding of 
herself and her situation. Ultimately she wants the thera-
pists’ help to rid herself of what troubles her. We might 
say: to “show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle” (PI §309). 
As anyone who has seen a fly-bottle knows, the only way 
out of the bottle is for the fly to go back the same way it 
came in. Wittgenstein’s image suggests that the philoso-
pher has to trace his way back to understand what gave 
rise to confusion and by doing so work his way out of con-
fusion. The method of perspicuous representation and the 
picture of the fly-bottle also characterize the therapeutic 
case. The therapist may, for example, help the patient see 
that she repeats a certain behavior by putting situations 
side by side and thereby drawing her attention to the pat-
tern in her behavior. In this way the patient gains perspicu-
ity. As for the fly-bottle, the therapist is trying to help the 
patient trace the symptoms back to the original traumatic 
situation that has been repressed so that she can confront 
it and reflect upon it, and ultimately rid herself of what 
troubles her.  
A perspicuous representation has the character of re-
minding somebody of something which has been there all 
along. In PI §126 Wittgenstein writes  
Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and nei-
ther explains or deduces anything. – Since everything 
lies open to view there is nothing to explain. For what is 
hidden, for example, is of no interest to us. One might 
also give the name “philosophy” to what is possible be-
fore all new discoveries and inventions.  
The psychoanalytic case seems at first glance to be differ-
ent since doesn’t ‘repressed’ imply that something does 
not lie open to view? But a perspicuous representation is a 
form of understanding and knowing more by arranging and 
connecting things already there. Emotional reactions to 
situations, avoidance behavior, over-rationalizations are 
manifestations of the psychological problem and they do 
lie open to view. What lies hidden is of great interest to 
psychoanalysis but being “hidden” means not having fully 
taken shape in the understanding. What Klaus Puhl says 
can clarify this: 
Perspicuous representations do not represent some-
thing that exists self-identically and objectively under-
stood by the subject before it is made perspicuous. 
Rather, making a case perspicuous at the same time 
constitutes it as having a certain meaning and coher-
ence. It is this constitutive relation between something 
that happened earlier, e.g. the puzzling object or ex-
perience, and something that happens later, that is 
achieved by the perspicuous representation. (2006, p. 
30) 
In psychoanalysis the patient comes to recognize and un-
derstand that which has been there all along. 
I have said that the therapist can help the patient to see 
connections, how? In Lectures on Aesthetics Wittgenstein 
suggests that persuasion plays a central role in psycho-
analysis. 
If you are lead by psychoanalysis to say that really you 
thought so and so or that really your motive was so and 
so, this is not a matter of discovery, but of persuasion. In a 
different way you could have been persuaded of some-
thing different. Of course, if psychoanalysis cures your 
stammer, it cures it, and that is an achievement. One 
thinks of certain results of psychoanalysis as a discovery 
Freud made, as apart from something persuaded to you by 
the psychoanalyst, and I wish to say this is not the case. 
(2007, p. 27) 
Is Wittgenstein here saying that any explanation would 
cure the patient? No. Rather, Wittgenstein is critical of that 
Freud expresses himself as if the results of psychoanalysis 
were discoveries when there can be no discoveries made 
in therapy but only achievements. Wittgenstein wishes to 
convey that persuasion plays an important role and further 
hints at that one can judge if the interpretation or persua-
sion is good by the curative effect. A passage in Introduc-
tory lectures on psychoanalysis where Freud describes 
what the therapist does shows that “persuasion” indeed 
plays a central role: the doctor “exhorts, forces his [the pa-
tient’s] attention in certain directions, gives him explana-
tions and observes the reactions of understanding or rejec-
tion which he in this way provokes in him.” (p. 17) Wittgen-
stein also discusses the role of persuasion in his own phi-
losophical practice: 
I very often draw your attention to certain differences, 
e.g. in these classes I tried to show you that Infinity is 
not so mysterious as it looks. What I am doing is also 
persuasion. If someone says: “There is not a differ-
ence”, and I say: “There is a difference” I am persuad-
ing. I am saying “I don’t want you to look at it like that.” 
(2007, p. 27) 
Persuasion, carefully applied, can help a person who has 
a limited or warped understanding of something – a pic-
ture, an explanation, an object or her own situation – view 
it from a better, or complementary, angle; to see aspects 
that are essential to gain a perspicuous view. To encour-
age or persuade the patient to look carefully at her situa-
tion, both at the context but also from close to (PI §51), is 
hard since it forces the patient to confront what she has

avoided but essential in helping her to reflect upon her 
own conception. 
I’ll let an imagery used both by Wittgenstein and Freud 
end the paper. It clarifies the work of the philosopher or 
therapist further and shows affinity in methods and in how 
they conceive of the problems that they are trying to solve. 
In Culture & Value Wittgenstein writes 
Grasping the difficulty in its depth is what is hard.  
For if you interpret it in a shallow way the difficulty just re-
mains. It has to be pulled out by the root; & that means, 
you have to start thinking about these things in a new way. 
The change is as decisive e.g. as that from the alchemical 
to the chemical way of thinking. – The new way of thinking 
is what is so hard to establish. (p. 55) 
Wittgenstein writes about philosophical problems arising 
from problematic uses of our language. Freud uses the 
same imagery in the Introductory Lectures 
The psychoanalytic suggestion can be compared with a 
surgical procedure: it is trying to lay bare and to get rid 
of something. It makes its impact close to the root; it 
looks for the conflicts which have given rise to the 
symptoms and uses suggestion in order to alter the 
outcome of those conflicts. The analytic treatment re-
quires strenuous work by both patient and doctor, di-
rected at lifting internal resistance. (p. 416-17) 
In both cases, as we have seen, tracing a problem back to 
its root means to carefully look at how the problem mani-
fests itself, in language use and/or in behavior, and in try-
ing to find connections between instances that can lead 
one to the source of the problem.

Seeing Emotion: An Application of Wittgenstein's 
Transitive/Intransitive Distinction 
Nicole Hausen 
Groningen, The Netherlands | n.r.hausen@rug.nl 
Abstract 
Wittgenstein indicates in a variety of remarks that we see the emotions of other people. Building on that idea, this paper offers a 
grammatical analysis of the concept of ‘seeing emotion’. Specifically, it is suggested that Wittgenstein’s distinction (which he 
introduces in the Brown Book) between ‘transitive’ and ‘intransitive’ uses of words applies to sentences like ‘I see the happiness 
in his face’ and ‘I see his fear’. This analysis brings out a certain connection with Wittgenstein’s notion of ‘imponderable evi-
dence’, and that connection is described. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Wittgenstein writes: 
“We see emotion.” – As opposed to what? – We do not 
see facial contortions and make inferences from them 
(like a doctor framing a diagnosis) to joy, grief, bore-
dom. We describe a face immediately as sad, radiant, 
bored, even when we are unable to give any other de-
scription of the features. – Grief, one would like to say, 
is personified in the face. 
This belongs to the concept of emotion. (Z 225) 
That statement “I believe he feels what I feel in such 
circumstances” does not yet exist here: The interpreta-
tion, that is, that I see something in myself which I sur-
mise in him. 
For in reality that is a rough interpretation. In general I 
do not surmise fear in him – I see it. I do not feel that I 
am deducing the probable existence of something in-
side from something outside; rather it is as if the human 
face were in a way translucent and that I were seeing it 
not in reflected light but rather in its own. (RPPII 170) 
A number of commentators have discussed the import and 
relevance of these (and related) remarks, which empha-
size the non-inferential access we have to the emotions of 
others. The present paper seeks to contribute to this dis-
course by providing a new analysis of the concept of ‘see-
ing emotion’. The analysis given is a grammatical one, that 
is, one dealing with how the term ‘[to] see emotion’ is used. 
The paper thereby proceeds in accordance with Wittgen-
stein’s later philosophical methodology. In particular, the 
purpose of the work is not to make any empirical claims 
about (e.g.) how often we in fact see emotion, or any theo-
retical claims about (e.g.) precisely what role seeing emo-
tion may play in our overall understanding of others’ emo-
tions. Similarly, no attempt is made to define what emotion 
is, or what seeing is, such that we can see emotion. 
Rather, what is investigated is our use of sentences like ‘I 
see the happiness in his face’ and ‘I see his fear’. 
To begin, Section 2 below presents an overview of Witt-
genstein’s distinction between transitive and intransitive 
uses of words. Then it is proposed in Section 3 that this 
distinction applies to utterances of ‘I see emotion’, and the 
two different uses are described. Section 4 highlights a 
connection between Wittgenstein’s notion of ‘imponderable 
evidence’ and the intransitive use of ‘I see emotion’. Lastly, 
Section 5 points out the value of acknowledging the transi-
tive/intransitive distinction with respect to seeing emotion.  
2. Wittgenstein’s Transitive/Intransitive Dis-
tinction 
In the Brown Book, Wittgenstein spells out the difference 
between transitive and intransitive uses of words (cf. BB 
pp. 158-62). In doing so, he focuses mainly on the use of 
the word ‘particular’ (and the variant ‘peculiar’). Adapting 
one of Wittgenstein’s examples, suppose that there is a 
man sitting in a room, and we are observing that man. 
Then we might say to someone else, ‘The man has a par-
ticular way of sitting’. If we are asked, ‘What way?’, we 
might refer to a definite feature of the scene and respond 
that he is slouched over and leaning heavily on his left 
arm. This would be a transitive use of the word ‘particular’.   
But now suppose that the man is not slouched over and 
leaning on his left arm. Then we might nevertheless be 
inclined to say, ‘The man has a particular way of sitting’. 
And to answer the question ‘What way?’, we would simply 
gesture to the man and say, ‘That way’; or we would draw 
a picture of the man. Namely, we would seem to give a 
further description, but really all we would do is refer back 
to the sitting man. This would be an intransitive use of ‘par-
ticular’.   
In the transitive case, our use of ‘particular’ is therefore 
meant as a precursor to some further specification, de-
scription or comparison. In the intransitive case, ‘particular’ 
is not a precursor to a further specification, description or 
comparison, although it may seem like it is (and hence the 
use may seem like a transitive use). Using ‘particular’ in-
transitively instead just emphasizes that we are observing 
the man, and that we are, in Wittgenstein’s words, ‘trying 
to let [the visual scene] make its full impression on [us]’ (cf. 
BB p. 162). 
3. The Transitive and Intransitive Uses of ‘I 
See Emotion’ 
Moving beyond the context of the Brown Book, Wittgen-
stein’s distinction also seems to apply to sentences such 
as ‘I see the happiness in his face’ and ‘I see his fear’. For 
if someone used these sentences, we could then ask, 
‘What do you see?’. This would be analogous to Wittgen-
stein’s question ‘(Particular in) what way?’ (cf. BB p. 160), 
and an answer will likewise take one of two characteristic 
forms.   
On the one hand, we might respond, ‘I see a broad smile 
and shining eyes’ or ‘I see trembling hands and a terror-
stricken face’. These answers provide a further specifica-
tion or description of what is seen, and hence they signal a 

Seeing Emotion: An Application of Wittgenstein's Transitive/Intransitive Distinction | Nicole Hausen

transitive use of ‘I see happiness’ or ‘I see fear’, respec-
tively. In particular, the transitive case involves a descrip-
tion of what might be called ‘phenomena of emotion’ or 
‘emotion-behaviours’. These are characteristic expressions 
of emotion appearing in relevant contexts (cf. RPPII 31-32, 
132-134, 148-151; see also Glock 1996, pp. 40, 96-7 for 
related ideas). The descriptions of these behaviours that 
we immediately use (e.g., ‘a broad smile’, ‘a terror-stricken 
face’) are conceptually connected to emotion. This is in 
keeping with what Wittgenstein notes in Z 225, since we 
describe what we see using concepts that directly relate to 
emotion, instead of (e.g.) giving a set of facial measure-
ments.   
Taking a cue from a remark (RPPI 869) in which Witt-
genstein indicates that we see meaning,
1 it could also be 
proposed that seeing emotion-behaviours (as such) in-
volves seeing their meaning. Interestingly, Shaun Galla-
gher and Dan Zahavi seem to have done something very 
much like this in their (Wittgenstein-infused) discussions of 
direct social perception. They say, for example, ‘In seeing 
the actions and expressive movements of other persons, 
one already sees their meaning’ (Gallagher and Zahavi 
2008, p. 185).
2 Seeing meaning would be another way in 
which we see, rather than infer, emotion when we see 
emotion-behaviours.     
On the other hand, however, we might answer the ques-
tion ‘What do you see?’ by saying, ‘I see him’. Or perhaps 
we would just repeat ‘I see the happiness in his face’ or ‘I 
see his fear’. These answers do not provide a further 
specification or description of what is seen, and they indi-
cate an intransitive use of ‘I see happiness’ or ‘I see fear’. 
In this case, the emotion that we see is not tied to any 
specific features, and it is reflected only in our inclination to 
say, ‘I see happiness’ or ‘I see fear’. Similarly, seeing 
meaning would just be due to seeing what we see. Thus, 
whereas the transitive use of ‘I see emotion’ draws atten-
tion to specific details of the scene (namely, specific emo-
tion-behaviours), the intransitive use of ‘I see emotion’ 
simply emphasizes that the scene is there and that I am 
having an experience involving it that I want to express 
with the given words.   
 
4. Imponderable Evidence 
A significant feature of the intransitive use of ‘I see emo-
tion’ is that it is, arguably, related to what Wittgenstein calls 
‘imponderable evidence’. Wittgenstein discusses impon-
derable evidence with respect to ascertaining genuine ex-
pressions of feeling (PPF 355-361). His thoughts are 
summed up well in the following remark:  
Imponderable evidence includes subtleties of glance, of 
gesture, of tone. 
I may recognize a genuine loving look, distinguish it 
from a pretended one (and here there can, of course, 
be a ‘ponderable’ confirmation of my judgement). But I 
may be quite incapable of describing the difference. 
And this not because the languages I know have no 
words for it. Why don’t I simply introduce new words? – 
                                                      
1 RPPI 869 occurs in the context of Wittgenstein’s investigations of aspect 
seeing, and it is directed at the theory of perception advocated by Gestalt 
psychologist Wolfgang Köhler. For discussions of ‘seeing meaning’ in contrast 
to the opposing Gestalt psychology position, see Cook 1994 (pp. 140-4) and 
Schulte 1993 (pp. 82-5). 
2 See also Gallagher 2008 (p. 542) for similar statements. It should be noted 
though that in the 2012 edition of Gallagher and Zahavi’s book (p. 207), the 
quoted text has been changed from ‘sees their meaning’ to ‘sees them as 
meaningful’, which has a different connotation. 
If I were a very talented painter, I might conceivably 
represent the genuine and the dissembled glance in 
pictures. (PPF 360) 
This account of imponderable evidence bears a striking 
resemblance to the intransitive use of, for instance, ‘I see 
his (genuine) happiness’. Namely, for both imponderable 
evidence and the intransitive use of ‘I see his happiness’, 
there is no definite element to be pointed to or described. 
Nevertheless, with enough skill, one might be able to cap-
ture the imponderable evidence via just a representation of 
the person; and this is analogous to the inclination to an-
swer ‘What do you see?’ by gesturing toward the person. 
To put this differently: In both the transitive and intransi-
tive cases, the answer to ‘What do you see?’ is not evi-
dence that one sees what one sees. But (the content of) 
the answer would count as evidence for the truth of sub-
sequent third-person ascriptions like ‘He [the person I see] 
feels happy’. Hence, when a speaker uses ‘I see his hap-
piness’ intransitively, the speaker’s evidence for the third-
person ascription ‘He feels happy’ is imponderable (as-
suming that there is no other evidence besides what the 
speaker sees). This evidence just consists in the speaker 
seeing the person and being inclined to say, ‘I see his 
happiness’. 
Along these same lines, another intriguing remark to 
consider is this: 
We say “The expression in his voice was genuine”. If it 
was spurious, we think of another one, as it were be-
hind it. – This is the face he shows the world; inwardly 
he has another one. – But this does not mean that 
when his expression is genuine, he has two identical 
faces. 
((“A quite particular expression.”)) (PI 606) 
Now, in his exegesis of PI 606, Peter Hacker interprets 
Wittgenstein as saying that we take the person’s words to 
be genuine because the words had a quite particular ex-
pression. Moreover, Hacker is surely correct in suggesting 
that Wittgenstein’s mention of ‘a quite particular expres-
sion’ refers to an intransitive use of ‘particular’ (Hacker 
1996, pp. 519-21).3 But the above-mentioned link between 
imponderable evidence and intransitivity then implies that 
we take the words to be genuine on the grounds of impon-
derable evidence – if we were asked for our evidence, we 
could only repeat that the expression in his voice was 
genuine. And this result hangs together perfectly with re-
marks in which Wittgenstein mentions imponderable evi-
dence directly and says that it may convince us that an 
expression is genuine (cf. PPF 358-360). 
5. Conclusions 
This paper has analyzed uses of sentences like ‘I see his 
fear’ as having the characteristics that Wittgenstein de-
scribes for transitive and intransitive uses of words. Rec-
ognizing these two different uses provides in itself a 
deeper understanding of the concept of seeing emotion. 
For instance, Wittgenstein indicates that although we can 
see both a face and fear in a face, this does not mean that 
the two objects of sight are conceptually (that is, gram-
matically) the same (RPPI 1068); and the transi-
tive/intransitive analysis brings out a way in which they 
differ. Namely, the hallmark of the intransitive use of ‘I see 
fear in his face’ is that there is no further description or 
                                                      
3 Although Hacker does not explicitly use the word ‘intransitive’, he cites 
pages 170-7 in the Brown Book, and it is clear that intransitivity is the concept 
he is discussing.

specification to give, whereas it would not make sense to 
say ‘I see a face but can give no further description of it’.  
But there is still more to be gained from the analysis. For 
when Wittgenstein discusses the transitive/intransitive dis-
tinction in the Brown Book, he stresses that philosophical 
confusion often arises when we fail to properly distinguish 
the two uses (for example, when we unreflectively assume 
that all uses of a certain word are transitive). It can there-
fore be questioned what sort of confusion would arise from 
failing to see intransitive uses of (e.g.) ‘I see his fear’ for 
what they are. 
The answer seems to involve imponderable evidence: 
When we take it for granted that all utterances of ‘I see his 
fear’ are transitive, this means we are taking it for granted 
that there must always be specific ‘ponderable’ evidence 
upon which we base our third-person ascriptions of emo-
tion. This leads to a distorted view of our concept of emo-
tion. In contrast, explicitly acknowledging the intransitive 
use underscores the legitimacy of imponderable evidence 
as well.  
Finally, it is also interesting to consider a more subjective 
(rather than philosophical) reason to take notice of both 
uses. This reason again concerns imponderable evidence 
and its relation to the intransitive use. It is as follows. 
In his discussion of imponderable evidence, Ray Monk 
suggests that Dostoevsky’s Father Zossima character is 
an example of someone who has the ability to appeal to 
such evidence (Monk 1990, pp. 548-9). To support this, 
Monk cites the following passage from The Brothers 
Karamazov: 
It was said by many people about the elder Zossima 
that, by permitting everyone for so many years to come 
to bare their hearts and beg his advice and healing 
words, he had absorbed so many secrets, sorrows, and 
avowals into his soul that in the end he had acquired so 
fine a perception that he could tell at the first glance 
from the face of a stranger what he had come for, what 
he wanted and what kind of torment racked his con-
science. 
Then Monk further suggests that Father Zossima pos-
sesses ‘Wittgenstein’s ideal of psychological insight’ (em-
phasis added). Yet by utilizing the analysis provided in the 
present paper, it could be said that Father Zossima would 
use sentences like ‘I immediately saw his grief’ intransi-
tively. Thus it would seem that, even from a non-
philosophical perspective, Wittgenstein might have felt it 
worthwhile to do justice to both the transitive and intransi-
tive uses of ‘We see emotion’.

The Sleepwalkers: How European Philosophers Parted Ways in the 
1920s—and What It Means for Contemporary Philosophy, Analytical 
and Continental 
George Heffernan 
North Andover, MA, USA | heffernang@merrimack.edu 
Abstract 
The decade 1920–1930 had a lasting impact on the divergence of European philosophy into “Analytical” and “Continental” in the 
twentieth century. The bookends of these years are two seminal works, namely, Wittgenstein’s Tractatus logico-philosophicus 
(1921) and Husserl’s Formale und transzendentale Logik (1929). These texts are guided by two distinct conceptions of the 
methods, horizons, and results of philosophy. Their styles of philosophizing are also different. Yet they exhibit uncommon 
common ground, for both investigate the relationship between philosophy and logic. Despite the promise for collaboration that 
these works show, however, their respective philosophical approaches have yielded only sporadic cooperation. Thus neither 
“Analytical” philosophers nor “Continental” philosophers have actualized their full potential. There is no necessity in this history. 
 
 
1. The fateful decade 
In The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914, 
Christopher Clark explains not why European leaders went 
to war in 1914 but clarifies how they did. Literature sug-
gests an analogous approach to the question of how Brit-
ish and other European philosophers parted ways after the 
war (Vrahimis 2013). The process started earlier (Dummett 
1996), but the decade 1920–1930 was decisive. 
1920: Russell writes to Husserl that he has followed his 
work “with interest & sympathy for many years”, that he 
had “the new edition” of his Logische Untersuchungen with 
him in wartime imprisonment (for pacifist activities and 
anti-American attitudes in 1918), and that he hopes for 
“international cooperation in matters of learning” after “the 
orgies of hatred” (BW VI, 367). 
1921: The Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung of Witt-
genstein, a former student of Russell at Cambridge who 
renounced academe and affluence to teach primary school 
in rural Austria, is published in Annalen der Naturphiloso-
phie; a German-English edition, the Tractatus Logico-
Philosophicus, with Russell’s Introduction, appears the 
next year. 
1922: Husserl, the first major German philosopher in-
vited to England after the war, holds four lectures on “Phe-
nomenological Method and Phenomenological Philosophy” 
at the University of London. 
1923: Ramsey, a student of Keynes, starts trying to get 
Wittgenstein to return to philosophy at Cambridge, and 
Husserl’s former assistant Heidegger is named ordinarius 
ad personam at Marburg. 
1924: Russell describes how “with the year 1900 a revolt 
against German idealism began”, praises Husserl’s Lo-
gische Untersuchungen as “a monumental work”, like “the 
admirable works of Frege”, one which exerted “a great ef-
fect”, and states that in England “Moore and [he] began to 
advocate similar views” (Russell 2004, 53)—supposedly 
he planned a review of the work for Mind. 
1925: Wittgenstein finishes his Wörterbuch für Volkss-
chulen, a spelling dictionary for elementary schools; it is 
published the next year, in which he resigns his teaching 
position in rural Austria. 
1926: After the Prussian Wissenschaftsministerium de-
nies a petition from Marburg to make Heidegger ordinarius 
due to lack of publications, Husserl helps proofread a 
manuscript of Heidegger (BW III, 347). 
1927: Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit appears in Husserl’s 
Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische For-
schung, Heidegger becomes ordinarius at Marburg, and 
Wittgenstein meets with members of the Vienna Circle. 
1928: Husserl describes Heidegger as “one of the most 
important philosophy teachers of our time” (BW VIII, 195) 
and has him listed “unico loco” as his successor at 
Freiburg (BW IV, 151). 
1929: Wittgenstein defends the Tractatus logico-
philosophicus as his dissertation at Cambridge, Heidegger 
holds his inaugural lecture “Was ist Metaphysik?” at 
Freiburg, and Husserl presents the Paris Lectures at the 
Sorbonne and publishes Formale und transzendentale 
Logik. 
1930: Husserl publicly criticizes what he regards as un- 
and anti-phenomenological “Philosophie der ‘Existenz’” (V, 
138–162). 
Collaboration between British-Austrian philosophers and 
other European philosophers seemed highly likely. Yet it 
did not materialize (Simons 2001). To understand why, 
one should begin with the relationship between Wittgen-
stein’s Tractatus and Husserl’s Logik. 
2. Wittgenstein’s Tractatus: Philosophy as 
propositional clarification 
According to the Preface, Wittgenstein’s Tractatus “deals 
with the philosophical problems” and “shows that the pos-
ing of these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the 
logic of our language”. “The whole sense of the book” is 
this: “What can be said at all can be said clearly, and one 
must be silent about what one cannot talk about.” The ap-
proach is not through thought but through language: “Thus 
the book seeks to draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to 
thinking but to the expression of thoughts: for to be able to 
draw a limit to thinking we would have to be able to think 
both sides of this limit (thus we would have to be able to 
think what cannot be thought).” Only this approach is sup-
posed to work: “Thus the limit will only be able to be drawn 
in language, and what lies on the other side of the limit will 
simply be nonsense.”

Presupposing that “all philosophy is ‘critique of lan-
guage’” (4.0031), the argument moves from everyday lan-
guage, through scientific language, philosophical lan-
guage, and metaphysical language, to meta-language: All 
the propositions of everyday language are “in perfect logi-
cal order” (5.5563), but very frequently the words of every-
day language are multivalent (3.323). The conventions of 
everyday language are “enormously complicated”, and it is 
not possible to understand immediately from everyday lan-
guage the logic of language (4.002). Thus “the most fun-
damental confusions easily arise” and “the whole of phi-
losophy is full of them” (3.324). Because “most of the 
questions and propositions of philosophers” rest on the 
fact that they have not understood “the logic of our lan-
guage”, and “most of the propositions and questions that 
have been written about philosophical matters are not 
false but nonsensical”, one cannot “answer questions of 
this kind”, but only “establish their nonsensicality”, and “it is 
not surprising that the deepest problems are really not 
problems” (4.003). Philosophy, which “should make clear 
and sharply delimit the thoughts that are otherwise cloudy 
and blurred”, is “not a doctrine but an activity”, whose “aim” 
is “the logical clarification of thoughts”; its “results” are not 
“philosophical propositions” but “clarifications of proposi-
tions”, so that “a philosophical work consists essentially of 
elucidations” (4.112). “The totality of true propositions” is 
“the totality of the natural sciences” (4.11), and philosophy, 
which is not one of the natural sciences (4.111), “limits the 
disputed sphere of natural science” (4.113). Philosophy 
“should delimit what can be thought, and, in doing so, what 
cannot be thought”; it “should limit what cannot be thought 
from within through what can be thought” (4.114). Philoso-
phy “will signify what cannot be said by presenting clearly 
what can be said” (4.115). “Everything that can be thought 
at all can be thought clearly”, and “everything that can be 
expressed in words can be expressed in words clearly” 
(4.116). 
Thus “the correct method in philosophy” would be “to say 
nothing except what can be said”, that is, “propositions of 
natural science” (“something that has nothing to do with 
philosophy”), and then, “whenever someone else wanted 
to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that 
he had not given a meaning to certain signs in his proposi-
tions” (6.53). The propositions of the work “elucidate in that 
he who understands [the author] in the end recognizes 
them as nonsensical, when he has by means of them—on 
them—climbed above and beyond them” (6.54). There is 
that which can be experienced existentially but not ex-
pressed verbally (6.522): “There is, indeed, that which 
cannot be expressed in words. This shows itself. It is the 
mystical.” Yet “one must be silent about what one cannot 
speak about” (7). 
3. Husserl’s Logik: Philosophy as sense-
investigation 
Russell quips that Wittgenstein “manages to say a good 
deal about what cannot be said” (Wittgenstein 1989, 284). 
Footnoting Wittgenstein’s Tractatus (XVII, 334), Husserl’s 
Logik suggests that one must speak about what one can-
not be silent about. Wittgenstein brackets out thought; 
Husserl, language (XVII, 23–26). 
The “Attempt at a Critique of Logical Reason” is an exer-
cise in radical Besinnung (FTL 13–14). Moving from objec-
tive, formal logic to subjective, transcendental logic (FTL 
I/II), Husserl avoids questions like “whether the good be 
more or less identical than the beautiful” (TLP 4.003). He 
describes “thinking” as “sense-constituting mental experi-
ence” in order to clarify how logical formations constitute 
themselves in intentional-evidential acts of consciousness 
(FTL 157–183). He does not get “entangled in non-
essential psychological investigations” (TLP 4.1121), but 
does talk about “the philosophical self” or “the metaphysi-
cal subject” in “a non-psychological way” (TLP 5.641). 
Agreeing that it is not about individuals but about essences 
(TLP 3.3421), Husserl applies the method of eidetic varia-
tion to describe the phenomena (FTL 252–257). Overcom-
ing psychologism (FTL 239–273), he focuses not on “psy-
chological subjects” but on “transcendental subjectivity” 
(FTL 257–262). 
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus is a ladder, but Husserl’s Logik 
is an edifice. From obscurity and vagueness to distinctness 
and clarity (FTL 53–76), Husserl elevates the propositions 
of logic to a degree of evidence that Wittgenstein could 
only intimate (FTL 191–209, 220–229). Wittgenstein is an 
“Analytical” philosopher (Hacker 1996), but Husserl is too, 
albeit of the descriptive kind. Formale und transzendentale 
Logik is his Tractatus Phenomenologico-Philosophicus. 
 
4. Continental drift and internal rifts 
In his London Lectures of 1922 (XXXV, 311–374), Husserl 
presented himself not as the realist of the Logische Unter-
suchungen (1900–01/1913–21
2) but as the idealist of 
Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenolo-
gischen Philosophie (1913). Russell’s rumored review of 
the Untersuchungen never appeared. He had probably 
learned (through Moore?) that the lecturer was not the phi-
losopher whom he had addressed in 1920 and praised in 
1924. 
In 1927–1928, the attempt of Husserl and Heidegger at 
an article “Phenomenology” for the Encyclopedia Britan-
nica (IX, 237–301) exposed the horizonal difference be-
tween them: Husserl sought Sein through Bewußtsein; 
Heidegger sought Sein through Dasein. Husserl distin-
guishes three phases in his relationship to Heidegger (BW 
II, 180–184: 6.1.1931): Before Sein und Zeit, Heidegger 
presented himself to Husserl as “[his] student and future 
collaborator”, to whom he could entrust the future of phe-
nomenology. As Husserl read Sein und Zeit, he was 
“alienated by the novel style of its language and thought”, 
but he accepted Heidegger’s assurances that any misun-
derstanding was “Unsinn”. After the publication of Formale 
und transzendentale Logik (July 1929), Husserl studied 
Sein und Zeit and Heidegger’s recent writings to arrive at 
“a sober final position” on his philosophy, coming to “the 
gloomy conclusion” that he had “philosophically nothing to 
do with this H[eidegger]ian profundity [Tiefsinn], this ingen-
ious unscientificality”. Tiefsinn is the word that Husserl 
uses in “Philosophy as Rigorous Science” (1910/1911) to 
condemn imitation “wisdom”, which falls for simple, cos-
metic order, and to commend genuine philosophy, which 
stands for conceptual and linguistic clarity and distinctness 
(XXV, 59–60). In 1923, Heidegger had said that Husserl 
“was never even for one second of his life a philosopher” 
(Thomä 20132, 40). 
As Wittgenstein’s Tractatus and Husserl’s Logik bookend 
the 1920s, so do Husserl’s London Lectures and Paris 
Lectures. The latter were well received; the former were 
not (Spiegelberg 1970). Husserl’s philosophy developed 
from the eidetic phenomenology of the Ideen I (1913) to 
the transcendental idealism of the Méditations Cartési-
ennes (1931). Ryle’s review of Sein und Zeit (1929) lo-
cated Heidegger in the tradition of Husserl. Husserl

123
claimed, however, that Ryle thus misunderstood his phe-
nomenology (BW VI, 179–181: 15.3.1930). Yet Ryle’s re-
port to The Aristotelian Society (1932) branded phenome-
nology as a dubious style of philosophizing. As with 
Husserl and Heidegger, so with Frege and Wittgenstein—
Frege 
found 
the 
Tractatus 
unintelligible 
(GF/LW, 
28.6.1919, 16.9.1919; Wittgenstein 1974, 71). Also, Witt-
genstein dismissed Russell’s Introduction to the Tractatus 
as “Oberflächlichkeit und Mißverständnis” (Wittgenstein 
1974, 87). Believing in “that whereof one cannot speak”, 
Wittgenstein contemned logical positivism, but condemned 
tractarian dogmatism (1932–34). Schlick criticized Husserl 
(1918); Carnap, Heidegger (1931/1932) and Wittgenstein 
(1963). 
5. The distinction without a difference? 
The distinction between “Analytical” philosophy and “Con-
tinental” philosophy juxtaposes a methodological charac-
terization—philosophy done by conceptual analysis—and 
a geographical designation—philosophy done not in the 
British Isles but on the European continent. Yet internal 
fissures accompany the external break between Analytical 
philosophy and Continental philosophy. Husserl’s reasons 
for rejecting Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit and Russell’s rea-
sons for rebuffing Wittgenstein’s Tractatus are analogous. 
Analytical philosophers established their notion of logical 
objectivity as the standard of scientific clarity and criticized 
Continental philosophers’ appeal to experiential subjectiv-
ity as a source of obscurity (Critchley 2001, Glendinning 
2006). Since 1962, the differences between the Society for 
Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy and the 
American Philosophical Association have reflected the 
Analytical-Continental division. Yet the unique style of phi-
losophizing at, for example, the Husserl Circle, combining 
Analytical clarity with Continental content, shows that, if 
most writing in Analytical philosophy is clear and much 
writing in Continental philosophy is obscure (Gutting 
2012), there is no necessity in this (Moran 2010). 
This sketch of the decade 1920–1930 brings the distinc-
tion between Analytical philosophy and Continental phi-
losophy into sharper focus. Despite their differences, Witt-
genstein’s Tractatus and Husserl’s Logik suggest that lin-
guistic clarity and conceptual precision are essential fea-
tures of rigorous philosophizing. The mark of genuine phi-
losophy is clarity; the flaw in questionable philosophy is 
obscurity. Once upon a time, there was no contradiction 
between being an “Analytical” philosopher and being a 
“Continental” philosopher.

Multisensory Integration: A Neurophilosophical account of Biology 
of Perception and Loss of Self-evidence in disorders of 
disintegration 
Inês Hipólito 
Lisbon, Portugal | hipolito.ines@gmail.com  
Abstract 
We perceive the environment and ourselves through the sensory system (Gallagher , 2005; Gallese and Sinigaglia , 2011; 
Damasio , 2012). The multisensory integration with the environment relates to the various aspects of self-experience, body rec-
ognition, actions, imagination, memory and consciousness (Gallagher , 2000; Damasio, 2001). We Share with humans, and 
even some animals, the images in which relies our concept of the world and which seems to imply perception, memory and rea-
soning. The images are directly based on neural representations and they are topographically organized (Damasio, 2011). 
These are formed, or under the control of sensory receptors or under the control of dispositional representations contained in 
the brain cortical and subcortical regions and nuclei. These neural representations have to be correlated, on an essential way, 
from moment to moment, constituting the basis for cognitive self-awareness. The "I" that is the author of thoughts, emotions, 
body and actions, and is continuously informed by multisensory inputs and the results of this mental impression are presented in 
the form of a perception as a whole (Gallagher, 2005; Zahavi, 2005; Gallese and Sinigaglia, 2011; Blanke, 2012; Damasio, 
2012). The perceptual inconsistency is analogous to the inconsistency of self-experience described by Sass and Parnas (2001, 
2003) as disorders of the self. Loss of association between thoughts, feelings and actions described by Bleuler (1911 ) or loss of 
self-evidence described by Blankenburg (1971 ). This paper will try to present the neuro-cognitive basis for the refutation of the 
"Cartesian Theater" defending the hypothesis that mental images are constructions of the brain from a fragmented activity in an 
integrated mind, and that an inconsistency at this level results from an inability integration of sensory-perceptual, which seems 
to be revealed in integration disorders such as schizophrenia. 
 
 
1. Why the "Mental Image" is not a Carte-
sian Theatre  
The central nervous system is connected to every part of 
the rest of the body by nerves whose totality constitutes 
the peripheral nervous system. The nerves carry impulses 
from the brain to the body and the body to the brain. Fur-
thermore, the body and brain are also molecules chemi-
cally bonded by, for example, hormones, which are re-
leased in the brain or body and moving into the body or the 
brain through the blood stream.  
There are billions of neurons in the brain in our local cir-
cuits arranged that , in turn , form the core or cortical re-
gions. The cortical regions and the cores are connected 
together to form systems and systems of systems in pro-
gressively higher levels of complexity. In terms of scale, all 
neurons and local circuits are microscopic while cortical 
regions, and cores are macroscopic systems. Neurons 
have three major components: the cell body, the output 
fiber, the axon and dendrites or input fibers.  
The neurons are connected in circuits in which there are 
conductors as axons and synapses which constitute the 
points at which the axons establish contact with the den-
drites of other neurons. When neurons start into action, 
that is, when "fire”, there is an electrical current that travels 
through the axon. When this current reaches the synapse 
causes the release of chemical molecules known as neu-
rotransmitters.  
The concerted interaction of many neurons − whose 
synapses are adjacent and may or may not release their 
own transmitters − decides whether the next neuron fires 
or not, i.e. whether it produces its own action potential, 
which will releases their own neurotransmitters, and so on. 
Synapses can be strong or weak. It is the synaptic strength 
that determines whether or not the impulses propagate, 
and the ease with which they do it the following neuron.  
To this extent, the activity of circuits in modern sectors of 
the brain such as neocortex is essential for the production 
of neural representations that are based on the mind and 
intentional actions. However, the neocortex cannot pro-
duce images of the underground fashioned brain (hypo-
thalamus, brainstem) is not intact and cooperative.  
Recent data seem to indicate that the construction of im-
ages occur from an integrated mind that results from an 
integrated activity (Damásio, 2011). That is, multiple lines 
of experienced sensory processing in mind, such as im-
ages, sounds, flavour and aroma, texture, shape , are 
sensory aspects that match. A hypothesis that contradicts 
the idea - widely discussed by Daniel Dennett on Con-
sciousness Explained - Cartesian Theater.  
According to Damasio (2000, 1995), there is not a single 
region of human brain equipped to simultaneously process 
all representations of sensory modalities that are active 
when we experienced at the same time, for example, 
sound, motion, shape, colour, a temporal registration and 
perfect space, a kind of synchronization. If the activity oc-
curs in anatomically separate brain regions, but this activity 
takes place within approximately the same time interval, it 
is still possible to connect separate parts, creating the illu-
sion that it befalls at the same location. If this is a valid ex-
planation, does not cease to run its risks, as the de-
synchronization, which seems to have happened in the 
cases of psychopathology such as schizophrenia, for as 
long as connection requires mechanisms of attention and 
working memory.  
The factual knowledge that is needed for reasoning and 
decision making comes to mind in the form of imagery. 
What is the neural substrate of these images? Any thought 
consists of images, whether comprised mainly of shapes, 
colours, movements, and sounds or spoken or omitted 
words. These images − which while occurring invoke

memory, are known as evoked images (unlike pictures of 
the perceptive type).  
By using evoked images, one can retrieve a particular 
kind of image of the past, which was formed when we 
planned something that has not happened yet but we ex-
pect to happen. As the planning process unfolded we were 
forming images of objects and motions and consolidating 
the memorisation of this fiction in our minds: the memory 
of a possible future and not the past that was.  
2. Senses Synchrony  
The dynamic map of the whole organism − a body schema 
and anchored in their respective border − could not be 
achieved in a single area of the brain, but in several, 
through patterns of neural activity temporally coordinated.  
When special senses are involved in perception, they 
produce a double set of signals. The first set comes from 
the body and has its origin in the particular location of the 
special sensory organ (eyes in vision, hearing in ears) and 
it is transmitted to the somatosensory and motor complex 
that dynamically represents the entire body as a functional 
map.  
The brain processes signals from the organism involved, 
this is, a reference to the body and on visual determina-
tions of whatever it is that excites the retina. It is therefore 
appropriate to describe the vision as "when body feels, this 
is what it sees". When we touch an object we receive two 
sets of local signals from the skin. One regards to the 
shape and texture of the object, while the other relates to 
the body site which has been activated by contact with the 
object.  
According to this idea, the primary representations of the 
action body imply a spatial and temporal environment 
based on the anatomy of the body and the patterns of mo-
tion in the environment. Indeed, on the one hand there 
seems to be an external reality that seems to get through 
the body in action, i.e., their representations and their dis-
orders. Nevertheless, we can never know to what extent 
our knowledge of reality is trustworthy. What we have 
seems to be a remarkable consistency in the construction 
of reality created and shared by the brains of each of us 
(Damásio, 2000, p. 302-303).  
These primary representations of the action body may 
play a role in consciousness, considering that they allow a 
core for the neural representation of the self, and thus, a 
natural way to what happens in the body reference within 
and outside its borders. This is a reference that eliminates 
naturally the generation of subjectivity by the Cartesian 
Theatre’s homunculus. Successive states of the organism 
occur, each on a new neural representation, on multiple 
concerted maps that provide moment by moment the exis-
tence of the self in a given time.  
3. Loss of Self-evidence in Schizophrenia  
According to Blankenburg, in "The Natural Loss of self-
evidence", in schizophrenia normal loss of reality occurs, 
that is, the direction of the unquestionable-challenging en-
vironment that generally allows a person to take for 
granted the social and practical world elements.  
It occurs as we may describe as a dysfunction of the 
normal capacity or proportions between the obvious mean-
ing and its absence.  
“The object seen can be either visual (eye) impressions, 
which are communicated to the rays when my eyes are 
open, or images which I can cause at will on my inner 
nervous system by imagination, so that they become visi-
ble to the rays” (Schreber, 1955, p.148).  
In Blankenburg empirical studies, it is proven that 
schizophrenic patients can perform surprisingly well tasks 
that require logical and abstract thinking, and have particu-
lar difficulties with problems of common sense, especially 
in relationship to the social world (Murphy & Cutting, 1988, 
1990). This loss of self-consciousness seems to show both 
positive and disorganized symptoms. Patients complain of 
the difficulty of putting into words what most ails them. 
Given that it is not an object, but an abstraction in the hori-
zon of possibilities for a certain type of experience, it is 
everywhere and nowhere:1 
“Again it is extremely difficult to describe these changes 
in words because matters are dealt with which lack all 
analogies in human experience and which I appreciated 
directly only in part with my mind's eye (…)” (Schreber, 
1955, p.117).  
“To make myself at least somewhat comprehensible I 
shall have to speak much in images and similes, which 
may at times perhaps be only approximately correct” 
(Schreber, 1955, p. 41).  
In disorders of Self-disintegration, it seems to occur a "loss 
of association" which leads many researchers to relate the 
sensory dysfunction with schizophrenia, since it occurs a 
sensory disintegration related to an ego-disintegration.  
The "I" that is the author 's thoughts , emotions , body 
and action is continually informed by multisensory inputs, 
which is essential to self-experience ( Gallagher , 2005; 
Zahavi , 2005; Gallese and Sinigaglia , 2011; Blanke , 
2012; Damasio 2012).  
The multisensory integration is the process that involves 
all the senses and that starts with the detection of input via 
specific receptors that translate modal stimuli (light, sound 
, chemical, mechanical , temperature) on neural activity. 
The results of this mental impression are presented in the 
form of a perception as a whole (Postmes , L. et al , 2013; 
Ernst and Bülthoff, 2004; Ayres et al , 2005; . Lou et al, 
2010.). In this perception, one must be able to differentiate 
between sources (inside/ outside), self/non-self, and be-
tween imagination/reality.  
All senses contribute to a normal sense of self: an inabil-
ity to multisensory integration is a perceptual incohence 
that can be induced by conflicting sensory inputs or unbal-
anced between the various types of input, i.e., a sensory-
motor conflict so that the information cannot be gathered 
into a single perception; leading thus to an incoherent self-
experience.  
Psychoses may have two interdependent components: 
1) hyper-rationality, the inner processes such as thinking 
or perceiving that normally occur without conscious and 
tasks that need to be mechanically driven by the loss of 
conscious thought field, i.e. decrease between focus and 
context: "my soul is in my heels, every step I take, I step 
on it"; "I am looking for arguments to make sense. Nothing 
has a meaning or purpose"; 2) and decreased presence: 
an alien experience that results in a reduced recognition of 
the body, bodily disintegration and reduction interoception: 
"losing this sense of being me , not being able to make 
sense of what happens to me , being unable to connect

with others , makes me feel unhumane " , " i know this is 
my body and face, but does not feel it that way. It's scary 
".”I think I am dissolving" (Postmes et al, 2013). Also re-
sults in a distortion of first person perspective: "I know they 
are my thoughts, but I do not feel they are mine".  
In short, perceptual inconsistency can cause depersonal-
ization, tenuous borders, and/or decreased sense of own-
ership and agency: in all these diminished perception of 
themselves manifestations are similar to a reduced sense 
of presence (Sass and Parnas, 2003; Gallagher, 2005).  
Conclusion  
Perceptual incoherence is analogous to the incoherence of 
self-experience described by Sass and Parnas as disor-
ders of the self. The loss of association between thoughts, 
feelings and actions described by Bleuler or loss of self-
evidence described by Blankenburg. According to these 
authors, the disorders themselves are the core deficit in 
schizophrenia.  
The pattern of multisensory integration or environment 
involvement in body perception in schizophrenia needs 
further investigation. Further research on sensory mecha-
nisms may increase our understanding of schizophrenia. A 
greater understanding of perceptual incoherence and self-
disorders as incoherent perception can increase the rec-
ognition of high-risk individuals and earlier recognition of 
the disorder. The hypothesis of perceptual inconsistency 
can offer a plausible explanation of the disorders them-
selves and prevent patients from seeking clarifications in 
the formation of delusions. Some patients may notice that 
their strategies for monitoring delirium aggravate their per-
ceptual inconsistency. Thus, therapies can decrease the 
perceptual inconsistency and relieve themselves of the 
incoherent experiences.

Is the Gettier Problem Caused by the Epistemic Passions of 
Analytical Philosophers? 
Helmut Hofbauer 
Vienna, Austria | helmut.hofbauer@meduniwien.ac.at 
Abstract 
The Gettier problem is completely incomprehensible for me as a philosopher with background in continental philosophy. 
However, in introductions to epistemology the Gettier problem is usually presented as an issue of common sense and everyday 
life. My analysis leads to the conclusion that analytical philosophers share a common sense that strongly differs from mine. 
Their attitude seems to be rooted in a passion of claiming knowledge (unnecessarily) in many everyday situations which is 
accompanied by a lack of need to talk about what they are actually doing when trying to solve the Gettier problem. 
 
 
I have a background in continental philosophy. The Gettier 
problem was the first product of analytical philosophy I 
came in contact with. In continental philosophy, it is always 
possible for me to understand more or less what philoso-
phers are talking about by applying the idea to their 
thoughts that they try to provide orientation in the world. 
This heuristic method failed when I tried to understand the 
Gettier problem. Please note that my understanding of the 
Gettier problem includes the so called standard analysis of 
knowledge which I conceive to be a part of the Gettier 
problem. 
1. The impossibility to find a problem in the 
Gettier problem 
Beginning to explain, why I do not understand the Gettier 
problem, I would like to note that I am not able to even 
conceive it to be a problem from the very start. 
The content of Edmund Gettier’s 1963 article „Is Justified 
True Belief Knowledge?“ is said to be that sometimes we 
believe to know something that is only accidentally true. 
This is true. This fact is related to the epistemic situation of 
the human being. The epistemic perspective of the individ-
ual human being is relative because she, possessing a 
body of flesh and blood, is always situated at a specific 
point in space and time. An absolute epistemic viewpoint 
might be attributed to God. God can see, and therefore 
know, everything because he can be everywhere at the 
same time. 
Analytical philosophers seem to be discontent with the 
solution that sometimes we mean to know things that are 
true only by chance. By reading analytical introductions to 
epistemology I learned that the cause for this discontent is 
their dispute with the sceptic (represented by the character 
of Skip in Jay F. Rosenberg’s book (2013)). The position of 
the sceptic is that we do not know anything, unless we are 
absolutely sure about it. The dispute analytical philoso-
phers engaged in with the sceptical position seems unmo-
tivated and senseless to me. They hold that if the sceptic is 
right, knowledge for us is impossible. This argument is not 
convincing, for throughout all history there has always 
been knowledge, or people at least claimed to possess 
knowledge, without taking it to be necessary to refute the 
sceptic first. History has shown that the building of knowl-
edge can very well be built on sand. 
As a consequence of their hostile attitude towards scep-
ticism, analytical philosophers try to find a definition of 
knowledge which is not as demanding as the sceptical one 
but, on the other side, doesn’t allow for knowledge that is 
accidentally true either. This research program is not com-
prehensible to me for it searches for a definition of knowl-
edge where knowledge is in between the states of perfec-
tion and imperfection. How can there be such a state? It 
resembles the search for the position of a door where this 
door is in between the states of being open and closed. 
This is the reason why I do not understand what analytical 
philosophers are seeking when they try to solve the Gettier 
problem. 
2. Adding a little bit of context would easily 
dissolve the Gettier problem 
If we want to understand a specific problem, it is normally 
helpful to be provided with information about the specific 
situation the subject having this problem is in. When study-
ing the problem of knowledge it also would make things 
easier if we were told more about the specific problem a 
person wants to resolve with the help of knowledge. This is 
our usual way of understanding problems. We normally do 
not ask: “What is knowledge?”, but: “What do you want to 
know? And what do you want to know it for?” 
Unfortunately, analytical philosophy seems to follow the 
principle that resolving the problem is the only thing that 
can or should be done with a philosophical problem. This 
attitude results in a lack of discussion on the problem itself, 
on the context in which we conceive it to be a problem. My 
difficulties to imagine what would be a desirable solution to 
the problem of knowledge are a consequence of this con-
textlessness.  
If we added a little bit of context to the Gettier problem it 
would dissolve immediately. 
For example, we could understand the problem of 
knowledge in the form that a person is dissatisfied with her 
knowledge. In this case the Gettier problem will acquire the 
form of a cost-benefit analysis. The individual, being the 
epistemic 
subject, 
will 
ask 
herself: 
How 
much 
time/money/effort am I willing to invest in order to make 
sure that I really do possess a specific knowledge? In this 
context the Gettier problem will dissolve into non-existence 
because what is knowledge will depend on the satisfaction 
of the epistemic subject with her own knowledge, and not 
on a definition of knowledge. 
Another possible context of the Gettier problem could be 
that other people are dissatisfied with the knowledge of a 
specific person. In this context, we are not dealing with the 
problem of knowledge itself but with the problem of social 
recognition of individual knowledge. Once again the con-

text added would change the original description of the 
Gettier problem, and we would be back in a well-known 
topic of continental tradition of philosophy, e.g. the French 
philosopher Michel Foucault has investigated the relation-
ship between knowledge and power. However, analytical 
philosophers don’t seem to be interested in this topic. 
3. The Gettier problem is not about real 
people 
I might be asked: “Why shouldn’t it be possible to reflect on 
the problem of knowledge in general?” To this question I 
might respond that knowledge in the Gettier problem is 
defined as the state of mind of an epistemic subject, and 
its content is said to be propositional knowledge. Further-
more, the established method of studying the Gettier prob-
lem is by judging thought experiments with the help of our 
intuitions. That means, the Gettier problem is not about 
knowledge in general anyway; knowledge in the Gettier 
problem is already specified. 
Hence, context actually is involved in the treatment of 
the Gettier problem, but it seems to enter through the back 
door without being consciously controlled within the design 
of the problem setup. In these thought experiments, per-
sons situated in specific situations occur. However, it does 
not look like they could actually be real persons in real 
situations. 
This was the subject of my talk last year (2013) at the 
Wittgenstein Symposium. Concerning the first counterex-
ample to the standard analysis of knowledge in Edmund 
Gettier’s 1963 article, I referred to Don S. Levi’s article 
“The Gettier Problem and the Parable of the Ten Coins” in 
which he showed in an extraordinary manner that Gettier’s 
thought experiment does not function when it is conceived 
as a story. Levi demonstrated that Edmund Gettier’s first 
counterexample to the standard definition of knowledge is 
an incomplete story with many details left out. As soon as 
the missing details are added in order to make the story 
plausible, the story crumbles and falls apart. 
Concerning the second Gettier example I argued that if 
Smith had no idea about where his other friend Brown 
was, he would not try to find it out by using the logical in-
ference of disjunction, saying: “Jones owns a ford or 
Brown is in Barcelona.” Christoph Schmidt-Petri (2003), 
using logical arguments, claimed that in the first Gettier 
counterexample the belief condition is not fulfilled. I think 
this is true for both counterexamples. However, I would 
express it in a kind of language that reflects the situation a 
person is in. For example, what exactly does Smith believe 
when he believes that “Jones owns a ford or Brown is in 
Barcelona”? I can’t imagine that belief. 
By showing that the Gettier problem does not represent 
any real persons in real situations that could possibly be 
imagined, I was convinced to put forward a conclusive ar-
gument against it. Nevertheless, the reaction of my audi-
ence was near to zero. I concluded that with my argumen-
tation I obviously did not even come near to what the Get-
tier problem means for analytical philosophers. 
4. The Gettier problem was not discovered 
by Edmund Gettier 
So far I have taken into account the possibility that the 
Gettier problem might be a problem of real persons in real 
situations. But somebody might say: “The Gettier problem 
is a famous problem taken from the history of philosophy.” 
If this answer is correct, there seems to be no need for 
asking whether the Gettier problem makes sense for real 
people in concrete situations. It is like it is, because it al-
ways was that way. 
Analytical philosophers like to present the Gettier prob-
lem in the following historical context: before Gettier eve-
rybody believed that knowledge is justified true belief, and 
Edmund Gettier was the first philosopher to draw attention 
to the fact that the conditions of justification, truth and be-
lief do not suffice for knowledge (Chisholm (2004), p. 136). 
But this story is untrue! Already Plato described a case 
of justified true belief that is not knowledge in his dialogue 
Theaetetus. If somebody knew how to write the name of 
“Theaetetus” correctly, writing it with “th” and “e”, but would 
write the name “Theodorus” incorrectly, writing it with “t” 
and “e” (because he did not understand the Greek syllable 
“the”), he would have a justified true belief about how to 
write the name of “Theaetetus” (because he knows all 
parts (that is: all letters) of this name and their correct or-
der), but he wouldn’t possess knowledge about how to 
write that name. 
The other part of the story goes that before Gettier eve-
rybody believed in the so called standard analysis of 
knowledge. This part is not true either. Already Plato re-
fused to accept it: 
“SOCRATES: […] And so, Theaetetus, knowledge is nei-
ther sensation nor true opinion, nor yet definition and ex-
planation accompanying and added to true opinion?” 
(Theaetetus [210b]) 
To my knowledge, the standard analysis of knowledge 
does not play any role outside the analytical tradition of 
philosophy. I did not come to know it during my studies of 
philosophy at the University of Vienna. On the other hand, 
the analytical philosopher Alvin Plantinga claimed that be-
fore the time when the Gettier problem became famous the 
standard analysis of knowledge was not generally known 
and popular among analytical philosophers either; it rather 
received that status from authors of historiography of ana-
lytical philosophy (Plantinga (1993), p. 6-7). 
5. Analytical philosophers show strange 
“common sense”-attitudes 
At the end of my enquiry I am drawn back sharply to the 
fact that I am not able to understand the Gettier problem 
because I do not know what motivates analytical philoso-
phers to study it.  
The way it is usually presented in introductions to epis-
temology, especially in books for students or non-
professional philosophers, has made me believe that their 
authors believe it to be an issue of common sense. They 
use to present it in such a way as if anybody could under-
stand it within half an hour without any preparation in for-
mal logic. 
Hence I suspect that analytical philosophers have a 
common sense that strongly differs from mine. For in-
stance, when analytical philosophers introduce the truth 
condition of the standard definition of knowledge, they do it 
very quickly by saying that we would not say that a person 
knows a specific proposition, if this proposition was not 
true (Musgrave (1993), p. 2). I disagree: if a person says 
that she knows a specific proposition, this only means that 
she believes her knowledge to be true, but it isn’t neces-
sary for this proposition also to be true. Otherwise, how 
could we err?

If I try to imagine the figure of the analytical philosopher 
according to the literature I have read on the Gettier prob-
lem, I envision a person who is excessively sure of herself. 
She cannot endure the fact that she believes to possess a 
specific knowledge which later on might turn out to be not 
true. I suppose that this is the reason for the requirement 
of superhuman capacities in the Gettier counterexamples. 
In the first Gettier counterexample, we expect Smith to see 
the future in order to know whether Jones or he himself will 
get the job after the job interview. In Gettier’s second 
counterexample, we expect Smith do know the exact 
whereabouts of his friend Brown who is thousands of miles 
away in Barcelona. 
In Alvin Goldman’s ‘fake barn example’ (which is also 
commonly conceived as a Gettier example), in order to 
know that the barn he can see from his car is really a barn, 
we expect Henry’s spirit to fly from his car to the barn and 
right into it to make sure that it is not just the facade of a 
fake barn for a movie. 
Analytical philosophers seem to have the need to state 
that they “know” that there is a sheep in the field when 
they see one from great distance. On the other hand, the 
analytical philosopher’s passion for knowledge seems to 
exclude any need for discussing what the benefit of a defi-
nition of knowledge would consist of. Neither have I en-
countered the question whether it wouldn’t be better for us 
if no such definition succeeded; nor a discussion about the 
relationship between everyday knowledge and scientific 
knowledge given the limited time and epistemic resources 
of a normal human being. To sum up, analytical philoso-
phers do not talk about what they are doing when trying to 
solve the Gettier problem.

Aspect-seeing and Meaning 
Reza Hosseini 
Grahamstown, South Africa | reza.hosseini@ru.ac.za 
Abstract 
You see a face as friendly, a gesture as generous or pretentious, a smile as artificial or genuine, and a look in the eyes as 
frightened or hopeful, etc. But what do we see when see an aspect? In other words, what does it take to see an aspect? By re-
ferring to Wittgenstein’s discussion of ‘aspect-seeing’ and ‘aspect-blindness’ in his later works, I argue that in most cases we 
arrive at seeing an aspect not by an ostensive method but as a result of an involved relationship with that aspect in the course 
of ‘our complicated form of life’ (Wittgenstein 1958: 174). In this view, when you point at a face and tell the child that ‘this is a 
friendly face’, the child might take the friendly face to mean a smiling face, but not that all smiling faces are friendly; we learn 
that a smile sometimes represents other things besides friendliness, like confidence, condescension, or cruelty. Children smile, 
politicians, too. The child will not learn the meaning of friendliness merely by an ostensive method of teaching words; life will 
teach her what a friendly face is. 
 
 
Aspect-Seeing and Aspect-Blindness 
In part II of Philosophical Investigations (section 11), Witt-
genstein explicitly discusses aspect-seeing and its related 
topics. However, the subject appears in several other 
books.
1 A growing body of secondary literature on various 
aspects of ‘seeing’ and their implications for our under-
standing of value suggests that most Wittgensteinians 
have begun to take the importance of aspect-seeing in 
Wittgenstein’s philosophy seriously.
2 Wittgenstein begins 
the discussion on aspect-seeing as follows: 
I contemplate a face, and then suddenly notice its like-
ness to another. I see that it has not changed, and I see 
it differently. I call this experience ‘noticing an aspect’ 
(1958: 193). 
Here we are dealing with the two ‘uses’ of the word ‘see’. 
The first use deals with our normal visual experience; we 
see an object, a drawing, etc., and we use the expression 
‘I see this’. In the second use of the word ‘see’, we see a 
likeness, a similarity between two different things, for ex-
ample a likeness between two faces. In everyday life, we 
usually encounter this experience when we see a facial 
similarity between a mother and the son, a similarity be-
tween two pieces of music (say, the Adagio by Albinoni 
and the Air by Bach), the likeness between two movies in 
terms of their themes, etc. In all of these experiences see-
ing one object leads to discovering or seeing the other 
one. So, noticing an aspect, as Day and Krebs suggest, 
has a ‘double aspect’ (2010: 8). It is an experience in 
which we realise that something changes, and yet we 
know that nothing has changed. In other words, ‘we know 
that the change is not (so to speak) in the world, but (so to 
speak) in us’ (ibid.). This observation, as we will see, has 
far-reaching implications for our discussion. A classic ex-
ample of seeing-as or noticing an aspect, one that is also 
used by Wittgenstein (1958: 194), is Jastrow’s duck-rabbit 
as shown below: 
                                                      
1 Other remarks on aspect-seeing appears in Wittgenstein 1990: §§ 155-225; 
1988a: §§ 411-436, 505-546, 860-890, 952-1137; 1988b: §§ 355-391, 435-
497, 506-557; 1998a: §§ 146-180, 429-613, 622- 812; and 1998b: 12c- 19e. 
Related remarks on this subject can also be found in Wittgenstein 1969, 1975, 
1978, 1980. The substantial presence of this discussion in Wittgenstein’s body 
of texts implies that aspect-seeing was not only a diversion from the main 
discussions of Investigations. As Day and Krebs suggest, Wittgenstein’s notes 
on aspect-seeing are, rather, the expression of a theme whose figures and 
turns we might have been hearing, however, faintly, all along’ (Day & Krebs 
2010: 5). 
2 See, for example, Cavell (1979); Mulhall (1990); Verbin (2000); Monk 
(2001); Kellenberger (2002); Rhees (2003); Litwack (2009); Day & Krebs 
(2010). 
 
The picture can be seen as the duck or the rabbit, depend-
ing on the centre of one’s concentration when one looks at 
the picture. If you concentrate on the left side you most 
probably first see a duck but if you concentrate on the right 
side of the picture you probably will see a rabbit. Now 
imagine how someone who hasn’t seen a rabbit in her life 
would see the duck-rabbit picture. In this situation she ap-
proaches the picture differently; an aspect is missing in her 
approach, though the picture is the same. In her visual ex-
perience she would probably see the same physical prop-
erties that we attribute to the shape of rabbit but she 
wouldn’t call it a rabbit-seeing visual experience. 
Wittgenstein makes a distinction between ‘continuous 
seeing’ of an aspect and ‘dawning’ of an aspect (ibid.). 
Suppose I see the duck-rabbit picture and only see a duck 
(continuous seeing) but when I manage to see the rabbit in 
the picture, an aspect of the picture ‘dawns’ on me. A new 
perception emerges. As Wittgenstein says, ‘The expres-
sion of a change of aspect is the expression of a new per-
ception and the same time of the perception’s being un-
changed’ (ibid: 196). Usually, the expression of a change 
of aspect is accompanied with an ‘exclamation’, which 
manifests the change of aspect. In the dawning of the rab-
bit-picture on me I exclaim, ‘I see a rabbit now!’ The ex-
clamation of the change of aspect ‘is forced from us’ (ibid: 
197). We don’t merely give a report when a new aspect 
flashes on us; the report is accompanied with an exclama-
tion. One’s ‘tone of voice’ or body movements usually ex-
press ‘the dawning of an aspect’ (ibid: 206), like the way 
you close your eyes out of embarrassment when you real-
ise you shouldn’t have said what you have said to her. Or, 

Aspect-seeing and Meaning | Reza Hosseini

‘the likeness makes a striking impression on me; then the 
impression fades’ (ibid: 211). 
The other important notion that, as we will see, is related 
to one’s conception of life’s meaning is the notion of ‘as-
pect-blindness’. Wittgenstein asks   
Could there be human beings lacking in the capacity to 
see something as something− and what would that be 
like? What sort of consequences would it have? . . . We 
will call it aspect-blindness (ibid: 213). 
An aspect-blind person will have an altogether different 
relationship to the pictures to which he is blind. But aspect-
blindness is not limited to pictures. One can be aspect-
blind to various experiences in life. If I see someone and 
fail to see the smile in her face, then I am aspect-blind to 
her smile. Likewise, someone who is unable to appreciate 
and relate to a piece of music will be unable to recognise 
the subtleties and nuances that are usually hidden from a 
non-musical ear. In so many ways, Wittgenstein writes, 
aspect-blindness is ‘akin to the lack of a musical ear’ (ibid: 
214).  
What makes the notion of ‘aspect-blindness’ important 
lies in the connection between the concept of seeing-as 
and ‘experiencing the meaning of a word’ (ibid: 214). The 
question for Wittgenstein is: ‘What would you be missing if 
you did not experience the meaning of a word?’ (ibid.)  
Imagine yourself wanting to teach a child the meaning of 
the word ‘friendly’ or ‘unfriendly’. I might assume the best 
way to do so is to use the ostensive method of teaching 
words, i.e., pointing at a face and telling her: ‘This is a 
friendly face’ or ‘This is an unfriendly face’. We often tend 
to believe, as Verbin notes, that teaching a concept is as 
easy as teaching the name of an object, say, duck (Verbin 
2000). Thus, I might show a human face to the child and 
call it ‘friendly’, but then the child might identify the friendly 
face with the smiling face. However, not that all smiling 
faces are friendly; we learn that a smile sometimes repre-
sents other things besides friendliness, things like confi-
dence, condescension, or cruelty. Children smile, politi-
cians too. I submit the important point here, one that is per-
tinent to the question of life’s meaning, is that there is a 
history or a life behind every aspect-seeing and when one 
is blind to an aspect, one is in fact blind to the life or the 
history related to that aspect. Pointing to an aspect is not 
enough; one has to have a prior experience of that aspect 
to see it, or the aspect has to dawn. The child will not learn 
the meaning of friendliness merely by an ostensive method 
of teaching words; life’s experiences will teach her what a 
friendly face is. I mean a lot of trainings is required to learn 
these kinds of concepts. To learn what a friendly face is, is 
to learn many other things as one lives. And if I were to 
learn these concepts a certain level of agreement over 
definitions and judgments is required. Or, in Verbin’s 
words, learning of concepts ‘presupposes a certain 
agreement in judgments, a certain uniformity in experienc-
ing and reacting to various facts of our world’ (ibid: 12). For 
example, the child should be able to distinguish between 
different forms of facial expressions and to express differ-
ent reactions to each of them. On various occasions in his 
later works, Wittgenstein tried to advance and establish the 
basic idea that our common ‘forms of life’ guarantee this 
uniformity in experiencing the world. So, for example, he 
writes in Investigations: 
If language is to be a means of communication there 
must be agreement not only in definitions but also 
(queer as it may sound) in judgments (§ 242).

A Ladder and a Cave 
Herbert Hrachovec 
Vienna, Austria | herbert.hrachovec@univie.ac.at  
Abstract 
Wittgenstein's Tractatus does, at a first glance, employ a Platonic strategy, dividing the universe of discourse into two realms, 
with an atemporal, rationally transparent order determining a lower stratum. On closer inspection the Tractatus' „prototypes“ 
(Urbilder) come surprisingly close to Platonic ideas. The Wittgensteinian metaphor of a ladder may therefore profitably be 
compared to Plato's parable of ascent from a cave, the crucial difference being that Wittgenstein's image does not provide a 
return option. Feedback between the ideal and the real is, on the other hand, an essential ingredient of the success of Plato-
style progress. The later Wittgenstein, consequently, rejects the metaphor of a ladder in favor of what might be called the 
trouble-free plateau of the ordinary. Yet, this is not his only lesson. He also considers a kind of reverse Platonism with the 
philosopher, confused about the way things are, in need of redemption.

1. Platonic forms and sentence variables 
An easy (and legitimate) strategy to highlight Wittgen-
stein's contribution to contemporary philosophy is to draw 
attention to his anti-Platonism. He is quite explicit in his 
opposition to Plato's procedures. A very suggestive remark 
has made it into the Big Typescript: 
In Plato when a question like „What is knowledge?“ 
gets asked I don't find as a provisional answer: „Let's 
look and see how this word is used“. Socrates always 
rejects talking about particular instances of knowing, in 
favor of talking about knowledge. (Wittgenstein 2005, 
54e. BEE Ms. 213, p. 66) 
„What is ...“-questions, vulgo asking for the essence of 
things, are to be replaced by investigations into „family re-
semblances“ according to the Philosophical Investigations. 
But, even though Wittgenstein's criticism of his former self 
is duly noted by commentators, one obvious conclusion is 
seldom drawn. The author of the Tractatus Logico-
Philosophicus, against whom the  arguments are directed, 
must likely have held some of those Platonic views his 
later self decidedly rejected. One would, admittedly, not 
look for a metaphysical superstructure in a book program-
matically excluding traditional speculative doctrine and re-
fusing to enter into any of the ethical concerns Plato char-
acteristically pursues. Yet, Wittgenstein's elaboration of 
„logical form“ can hardly be understood without invoking 
some set of extra-sensual, guiding principles over and 
above (as the saying goes) the mere given.  
It might be objected that the logical apparatus behind 
meaningful propositions, e.g. the Fregean analysis of sen-
tences and truth functions, is of an entirely different kind 
than the „forms“ (ideas) Plato is concerned with. But there 
is one, admittedly somewhat esoteric, line of argument 
which has a decidedly Platonic touch. It runs along the fol-
lowing lines. The picture theory establishes an isomorphic 
correlation between the constituents of a state of affairs 
and a sentence modeling its structure. This is usually given 
an empiricist gloss: sentence components are arranged 
just like real world givens, e.g. like cars in the Paris court-
room case Wittgenstein refers to in his Notebooks 
(29.9.1914). There is, however, a crucial problem with this 
account. As far as our sensory input is concerned there 
are no „cars“ -- or „things“ for that matter. We are pre-
sented with stimulus patterns that can very well be „pic-
tured“ by verbal or written pronouncements, but this is 
strictly ad hoc. There is no way a given tableau of sense 
impressions, mirrored by a corresponding utterance, can 
convey a world consisting of self-sufficient, medium-term 
robust entities. 
Items like cars are fairly constant in time with recurring 
characteristics which, consequently, must be recognizable 
in the sentences involved. The picture theory, however, in 
its most basic version, does not satisfy this requirement. 
There is no pictorial equivalent of someone seeing a car 
when confronted with a certain shape. This well known 
issue of radical empiricism feeds straight into Platonic ar-
guments. In order to recognize shapes as car-shapes an 
idea of such a vehicle has to be involved. Now, it is impor-
tant to note that Wittgenstein actually provides a machin-
ery to mimic such Platonic forms. It is an intricate construc-
tion which can only be sketched here (cf. Hrachovec 
2000). Generality is at the core of Wittgenstein's recon-
struction. He separates this feature from truth functional 
procedures (Tractatus 5.521), i.e. he does not regard 
quantifiers as purely formal operators but rather as indica-
tive of content. Not of single, ad hoc givens, but as stand-
ins for common features in sentences, picturing common 
traits of the world respectively. The required syntactic work 

A Ladder and a Cave | Herbert Hrachovec

is done by what he calls „sentence variables“ (Tractatus 
3.313) which, in turn, designate „prototypes“ (Urbilder) 
(Tractatus 3.24). Meaningful sentences posses an infra-
structure designed to precisely capture the commonality 
„behind“ (or „above“) sense impressions first encountered.  
It is against this background that, when scrolling through 
the numerous depictions of Plato's cave, a feature caught 
my eye. While the usual means of ascent from below is by 
steps, one particular picture shows a ladder instead. I take 
it as a hint. It might be worthwhile to explore the motive of 
a ladder leading out of a cave. 
2. One Way only 
Wittgenstein's treatise suggests that ordinary discourse is 
often muddled and needs to be put in order. And his pre-
scription – conform to the timeless regime of logical  forms 
– can easily be thought of as an Enlightenment advice to 
overcome obstacles of old customs, tradition and resis-
tance to progress. Upwardly mobile agents may use vari-
ous devices to come out top. Yet, there is an apparent dif-
ference between steps (or stairs) and a ladder: those are 
fixed in place whereas the latter is removable. This in-
nocuous detail is crucial nevertheless. Both Plato and 
Wittgenstein are superb storytellers, completely in com-
mand of their narratives and their impact. One cannot dis-
pose of stairs as one can get rid of a ladder (Tractatus 
6.54). Wittgenstein's variation on the motive of attaining 
superior knowledge is markedly special because of this 
small twist. 
There is, supposedly, no way back. The journey, accord-
ing to Wittgenstein, is one way. The allegory of the cave, 
on the other hand, derives most of its prominence in West-
ern philosophy precisely from its inbuilt route reversal. It 
does not just describe the attainment of cognitive superior-
ity, but, at the same time, the embattled relationship be-
tween the climbers and the remaining „population“. 
Enlightened, the liberated agent turns back and attempts 
to teach his former companions the truth about their pre-
dicament (Plato: Politeia 516d-517a). This feature of the 
Platonic fable is essential for paideia, the formation of hu-
man rational capacities, much touted as Bildung in the 
Central European context. The Platonic outlook, even 
though it starts with an „aristocratic“ gesture, is well suited 
to be „domesticated“ within a democratic environment, 
susceptible to a productive interchange up and down some 
„stairs“. Wittgenstein, against this participatory construc-
tion, rejects progressive dialectics. He operates within the 
bare outlines of dialectical oppositions like down/up, dark-
ness/light, confusion/enlightenment, but refuses to be 
drawn into the kind of drama traditional philosophy has 
often developed in their wake. 
Substituting the customary stairs by a ladder in picturing 
the cave can now be seen as a non-trivial matter and Witt-
genstein's complicity with the paradigm of upward mobility 
appears in a new light.  Much of the puzzlement about his 
famous dictum as to the ladder can be traced to his distinc-
tive use of a well established Platonic trope, which he 
echos while adapting it to a different purpose. A ladder, 
after all, may be used like a stair. In mentioning this in-
strument Wittgenstein seems to be in line with the general 
draft of self-development suggested by the notion of as-
cent. And then he springs his surprise by  exploiting pre-
cisely the feature distinguishing ladders from stairs, break-
ing the continuity of the process and leaving the agent up 
on a higher tier, yet isolated from her provenance. 
Given that Platonic imagery is deeply engrained in our 
civilization's cultural repertoire, Wittgenstein's climber, es-
chewing the more obvious give and take between direc-
tions, is an intriguing eccentric relative to a locus commu-
nis. Wittgenstein did not remain comfortable with this 
stance as the next section will point out. In the meantime 
there is a benefit to be reaped from the foregoing consid-
erations. If we bracket its similarities with the Platonic en-
terprise we arrive at a more relaxed view of the melodra-
matic coda of the Tractatus. The claim that the very lan-
guage used to establish conditions of meaningful dis-
course is not itself meaningful and has to be discarded is a 
provocative paradox that has given rise to many a discus-
sion. The issue should be demystified and here is a non-
Platonic scenario to present the point: think of one time 
only passwords. Access to a realm of sense is granted to 
someone using code which, obviously, is not part of the 
meaning it gives access to. It does not, furthermore, itself 
possess any meaning other than to unlock a certain realm. 
There is no way back once you cross the line, which is in 
fact the Wittgenstein coup. The appropriate comparison 
here is not to paideia but rather to solving a riddle or mak-
ing a joke. Once you grasp the punch line you are done.  
3. All I really want to do 
Let us call the place Wittgenstein envisages at the end of 
his Tractatus the trouble-free plateau; a riddle solved, no 
further questions necessary or, for that matter, possible. 
(High quality detective stories work like that.) This is de-
cidedly not the spirit of modern age progressivism en-
shrined in the concluding verses of Goethe's Faust:  
„Whoever strives, in his endeavor / We can rescue from 
the devil.“ (Goethe, J.W. Faust v. 11936 f.). The later Witt-
genstein's break with metaphysical exertions does, conse-
quently not consist in holding an enigmatic position at the 
fringe of Platonism but in forswearing the ladder. 
I might say, if the place I what to reach could only be 
climbed up to by a ladder, I would give up trying to get 
there. For the place to which I really have to go is one 
that I must actually be at already. Anything that can be 
reached by a ladder does not interest me. (Wittgenstein 
1998, 64e. BEE Ms. 109, p. 207) 
The trouble-free plateau lacks the incentives common to 
Plato’s allegory as well as Wittgenstein's Tractatus. The 
question then becomes what kind of philosophy – if any – 
it supports. One answer is developed by the later Wittgen-
stein insisting on the power of ordinary language. There 
are no aims beyond our common means to make sense of 
the human predicament. The ordinary, according to this 
view, rests in itself and needs no „exits“ into more adven-
turous realms. We cannot outdo acquiescence with the 
most basic conditions governing our life. Attempts to call 
them into question presuppose deep-seated competences; 
they loose their grounding otherwise. In order to move 
something with our hands, Wittgenstein remarks, our feet 
have to stand firm (Wittgenstein 2000, Ms. 107, p.294).  
While this is the position most often associated with 
Wittgenstein's writings after 1929 it is not the only one he 
considered. Alfred Schmidt, in a paper submitted to this 
conference (Schmidt 2014), has reminded readers of an-
other, multilayered  option.  
You must not try to avoid a philosophical problem by 
appealing to common sense; instead, present it as it 
arises with most power, you must allow yourself to be 
dragged into the mire, and get out of it.” (Wittgenstein 
1979, p.108f)  

A Ladder and a Cave | Herbert Hrachovec 
 
 
 134
We noticed that Wittgenstein's thrown-away ladder im-
pedes feedback, but here we are, unexpectedly, on Pla-
tonic territory again. It's just that the roles are reversed. 
Traditionally „ordinary people“ were caught in the mire and 
had to find the way out on a philosopher's promise. With 
Wittgenstein it is just the other way round. He advises his 
listeners to allow themselves to be dragged down into phi-
losophy and to work their way up to common sense. This 
is paideia after all, applied to the professionals in lieu of 
those they claim to teach. The trouble-free plateau, ac-
cording to this remark, is not just a flat surface and Witt-
genstein is not the quietist some people have accused him 
to be. 
Is there a way to reconcile the two approaches? Or, to 
put it another way, where does Wittgenstein's contra-
Platonic, anti-philosophical Platonism end up? Two points 
have to be made. The first one is that this very question is 
by no means a neutral one. It clearly does not arise within 
the context of a trouble-free plateau where multiple incom-
patible forms of (thinking about) life presumably coexist 
peacefully. The question pushes the issue of a correct, 
non-contradictory answer, which is a typical philosophical 
move. So, if you find Wittgenstein's recourse to the ordi-
nary entirely convincing, stop here. The second point is 
that one can find some attempts to face the dilemma of 
trouble-free and troublesome  in the Nachlass. Wittgen-
stein proposes a version of „end up“ covering both alterna-
tives. 
The difficulty - I might say - is not that of finding the so-
lution but rather that of recognizing as the solution 
something that looks as if it were only a preliminary to 
it. (Wittgenstein 1981. BEE Ms. 109, p.207) 
This somewhat enigmatic advice makes perfect sense if 
solutions are not simply unique, straightforward, and logi-
cally coercive outcomes. Riddles can have multiple solu-
tions and cognitive conflict can be resolved in many ways. 
The trick is to realize that something that seemed to only 
be part of the problem may likewise serve as a solution. 
„The difficulty here is: to stop ... for you are already ‘at’ 
where you need to be; ...“ (Wittgenstein 1981, 314. BEE 
Ms. 109, p.207) So where does Wittgenstein end up? 
Good question. - Let us leave it at that.

Wittgenstein’s Argument on Aspect 
Tomoaki Ihara 
Tokyo, Japan | iharato@swu.ac.jp 
Abstract 
This paper deals with the issue of aspect and aspect-seeing, following Wittgenstein, to put a new light on the concept. The 
following are the five points to discuss; 1) There’s no aspect-free looking at things. Everything I see is always aspect-related. 2) 
When aspects change, what changes is not the object but the way of looking it. 3) The expression “seeing A as B” functions as 
a statement of grammatical rule. 4) Our communication (language-games) would be different either in a mono- or a multi-aspect 
situation. Whereas we can exchange our ideas on the basis of the shared meaning in a mono-aspect situation, we have to play 
a language-game with diverse meanings with no guarantee of the common signification in a multi-aspect situation. 5) As aspect-
blind person would have difficulties when s/he engages in language-games in a multi-aspect situation, because s/he recognizes 
just one meaning (aspect) out of many. 
 
 
Wittgenstein’s remarks on the concept of aspect and as-
pect-seeing have often been considered in the light of aes-
thetic and moral perception, self-knowledge, mind and 
consciousness, linguistic agreement, philosophical ther-
apy, and “seeing consciousness,” (Day & Krebs 2010) but 
there have been few, if any, studies which highlight the 
pertinence of the aspect to his discussions on meaning, 
others, and rule-following. To them this paper connects the 
issue of aspect and aspect-seeing, following Wittgenstein’s 
argument, to put a new light on the concept. 
1. Everything is aspect-related. 
When we engage in everyday language-games, a thing or 
a situation we construe seems to have one aspect in some 
time and more than one in other time. Important is the fact 
that there is no “looking” neutral to any aspects. When I 
see Jastrow’s duck-rabbit and say “I saw it as a duck but 
now I see it as a rabbit”, I might wrongly think there is “it”, 
the duck-rabbit itself, which exists in itself and free from 
any way of looking. However, there is no “it” as such. Eve-
rything I see is always aspect-related.  
2. Aspects’ change means the alteration of 
the way of looking at things. 
When there is one and only one aspect of things, I would 
like to call it a mono-aspect situation. On the other hand, 
when there are more than one, I’ll call it a multi-aspect 
situation.  
For some cases, there really is just one aspect and we 
perceive only one aspect of things. One example of this 
kind is, as Wittgenstein suggests, a knife and fork. (cf. 
Wittgenstein 2009, PPF 122) When I see it, it looks like 
just as such, and I just notice one aspect of it. On the other 
hand, for other cases, we can perceive more than one as-
pect of things. Wittgenstein takes Jastrow’s duck-rabbit as 
instance.
1 When I see it, “it can be seen as a rabbit’s head 
or as a duck’s.” (Wittgenstein 2009, PPF 118)  
When does an aspect matter? Only in a multi-aspect 
situation. What’s the difference between a mono-and a 
multi-aspect situation? It’s whether aspects change or not. 
Just as in Jastrow’s figure, aspects in a multi-aspect situa-
                                                      
1 The duck-rabbit seems to have two aspects, and it is a “primitive” example of 
aspect problems. Of course, we can take anything else with more than two 
aspects as instance, but I will follow Wittgenstein in that it is easier to see how 
it works in a primitive game than in a complicated one. 
tion are changeable. Then, what is it that changes? A thing 
itself? Of course not. What alters is the way of looking at 
things. (cf. Wittgenstein 2009, 144; PPF 153)  
When I say “I see a knife and fork”, it’s the report of per-
ception. I am talking about a thing itself. When I say “I see 
a duck” or “I see a rabbit”, looking at Jastrow’s figure, it 
might also be the report of perception and I may also be 
talking about the figure itself. However, when I say “I see it 
as a duck” or “I see it as a rabbit”, looking at the same fig-
ure, it’s not the report of perception. They are the utter-
ances peculiar to multi-aspect-seeing. Here I am talking 
about the way I look at the figure. So, it’s very strange to 
say “I see a knife and fork as a knife and fork” because the 
expression “seeing A as B” should be used only in a multi-
aspect situation. “It would have made as little sense for me 
to say “Now I see it as …” as to say at the sight of a knife 
and fork “Now I see this as a knife and fork”. This utter-
ance would not be understood. Any more than: “Now it is a 
fork for me” or “It can be a fork too.” (Wittgenstein 2009, 
PPF 122) Those utterances would sound strange if they 
are told in a mono-aspect situation. (They are misused in 
an inappropriate language-game.) I can safely say “Now I 
see it as a rabbit”, “Now it is a rabbit for me” or “It can be a 
rabbit too” at the sight of Jastrow’s figure if I’m in a multi-
aspect situation. Why is that? That’s because the expres-
sion “seeing A as B” functions as the grammatical sen-
tences, namely a rule, when used.  
3. Seeing an aspect and following a rule 
The utterance “I see it as a rabbit” shows the way of my 
looking at Jastrow’s figure, and functions as a rule which 
states how I see the figure. In a mono-aspect situation 
where we see/ use a thing in just one way, it would be 
nonsense for most cases to explicitly state the rule we fol-
low because everyone can accord with each other and 
would have no trouble in mutual comprehension. A rule 
matters, just as an aspect matters, when people have 
more than one choice of the way of seeing/ using some-
thing. 
In this sense, “seeing A as B” (seeing an aspect) is the 
expression of a rule. Aspect-seeing can be compared to 
rule-following. They are both a kind of ability. Just as “’fol-
lowing a rule’ is a practice” (Wittgenstein 2009, 202) and 
it’s strange to ask how long or since when about having an 
ability, so do an aspect-seeing. (There’s a peculiar charac-
teristics to aspect; namely “an aspect’s lighting up”, 
though. (Wittgenstein 2009, PPF 118))

Again, “seeing A as B” is the grammatical rule by which I 
mean A is possibly seen in a different way, but I see it this 
way. When uttering it, I explain how to see A, and it’s the 
explicit statement of the rule. Let me take another example 
for explanation. Take up the expression “using A as B”, 
which is also the grammatical rule. If I say “I use this piece 
of wood as king of chess”, I explain how to use the piece 
of wood and that’s a statement of a rule. In the expression 
“using A as B” or “seeing A as B”, while A denotes a thing, 
B refers not to a thing but the way of our looking at A, and 
the whole expression works as a grammatical rule (for con-
firmation and so on) in the language-games.  
Let me take another example with multi-aspects; the 
numeral series “1, 2, 3, 5”. This series has more than one 
aspect. The one aspect is to continue the series with 7, 11, 
…, and the other is with 8, 13, ….  In the former “we see 
(use) the series as that of prime numbers”, while in the 
latter “we see (use) the one as that of the addition of the 
two precedent numbers”. It is easy from this example to 
understand the expression “seeing A as B” is nothing but a 
grammatical rule, which states the way of our looking at 
the series. Seeing which aspect resembles following which 
rule.  
4. Monologue and Dialogue 
In a mono-aspect situation, a thing (or a situation) has the 
one and only one aspect, so that it is seen/ used in just 
one way. One aspect denotes one meaning. For example, 
even though we don’t share the exactly same kind of im-
age of a knife and fork, we can successfully communicate 
with each other, using the word in the language-game. In 
principle no miscommunication would come out because 
there are no semantic differences between the interlocutor 
and me about the concept in the mono-aspect situation. 
Our communication is in a way considered as a “mono-
logue”, where, as to meaning, the interlocutor is equivalent 
and homogeneous to me. S/he is not regarded as an 
“other” in a language-game. 
On the other hand, when we engage in a language-
game in a multi-aspect state, the interlocutor and I cannot 
always accord with each other as to meaning in speech 
practice. If not, our linguistic exchange would possibly be 
exposed to miscommunication. It is shown in the applica-
tion whether we share the same meaning (aspect) or not. 
While our communication proceeds successfully, we can 
say we might have shared the same meaning (aspect) out 
of the multi-meanings (aspects). However, if our communi-
cation breaks down, it turns out that we didn’t have the 
meaning (aspect) in common. It is true we can check to 
see if our notice of meaning (aspect) is the same or not, by 
asking for the answer to the question “What do you mean 
by that?” or “Which aspect do you see?” However, we 
communicate with each other and proceed successfully, 
even without asking such questions. When do we need 
such questions? It’s when our communication breaks 
down, when our interlocutor linguistically-behaves differ-
ently from me. If so, s/he is nothing but an “other”. It should 
be rather called a “social intercourse” (or a “dialogue”) than 
communication. 
Imagine when someone is ordered to continue to write 
the series, and s/he says “Yes, I can continue the series”. I 
cannot presuppose s/he notices more than one aspect 
with the statement; his or her understanding is shown in 
the application. (Wittgenstein 2009, 146) If s/he writes 7, 
11, …, I think s/he sees the series as that of prime num-
bers., and if 8, 13, …, I guess s/he sees the series as the 
addition of the two precedent numbers. If s/he replies 
“What? I have no idea” to my question “Can you do it an-
other way?”, it turns out that s/he notices just one aspect 
of the series. Our communication breaks down, then. What 
about if I ask “Can you do it another way?” and s/he an-
swers “OK” and in fact can continue the series with 8, 13, 
…? S/he can accord with me in practice.  
Wittgenstein might think of the extreme case. S/he writes 
10, 12, 14, … after the series 1, 2, 3, 5. S/he might follow 
the rule “From the fifth number, you should write an even 
number after 10”. “No course of action could be deter-
mined by a rule, because every course of action can be 
brought into accord with the rule.” (Wittgenstein 2009, 201) 
Then, the gist of this example is the series might appear to 
have two aspects at first, but it has innumerable (infinite 
number of) aspects in fact.  
If I extend this example to most cases, I dare say even 
though it looks like a mono-aspect situation, it should be a 
multi-aspect one theoretically. For almost all the situations, 
they should have multi-aspects in principle. That’s the ba-
sic situation presupposed for our playing language-games. 
5. Aspect-blind 
In the former example, if s/he writes either 7, 11, … or 8, 
13, … and notices just one aspect, s/he is called aspect-
blind. Wittgenstein says as follows; “The aspect-blind man 
is supposed not to see the A aspects change.” (Wittgen-
stein 2009, PPF 257)
2 This way, people know someone is 
aspect-blind if s/he notices just one aspect and doesn’t 
see the aspects can change in a multi-aspect situation. 
An aspect-blind person notices only one aspect (mean-
ing) of things, and cannot recognize that there are other 
possibilities. S/he sees Jastrow’s figure in one way, and 
doesn’t expect it is changeable. So, s/he follows the rule 
(the way of his or her own looking at it) blindly. (cf. Witt-
genstein 2009, 219) 
An aspect-blind person can play a language-game of 
mono-aspect, but has a lot of difficulties in a multi-aspect 
situation. The ability to notice mono-aspect never fails to 
precede the one to notice multi-aspects, and not vice 
versa. (cf. Wittgenstein 2009, PPF 222 & 224) 
Imagine there is half wine left in the bottle. This situation 
is multi-aspect, because we can say both “There is little 
wine left in the bottle” and “There is a little wine left in the 
bottle”. An aspect-blind person can see it in either way. 
Another example. When someone says to a malicious per-
son “You are a good person”, we think the remark is an 
irony. However, an aspect-blind person only understands 
the literal meaning of the utterance. One more example. 
When someone says “Don’t let the cat out of the bag” or 
“It’s raining cats and dogs”, an aspect-blind person would 
have no idea of the expression, and be unable to under-
stand what the utterances mean. S/he cannot draw impli-
cations from the utterances which are not strictly there in 
the linguistic meaning.  
Since multi-aspects is , as I said, the basic situation of 
language-games, it is natural there are semantic differ-
ences between the interlocutor (an “other”) and me. Be-
cause an aspect-blind person lacks the ability to recognize 
more than one aspect in language-games, s/he loses a lot. 
It is really hard for him or her to engage in our everyday 
language-games.  
                                                      
2 I can imagine another case in which s/he cannot go on the series in any way 
from the beginning, saying “I have no idea”. Then, s/he can be said to be 
“meaning-blind”. In this case, our communication would not proceed at all.

Last but not least important. I’ve told that if I am not as-
pect-blind and when I say “I saw it as a rabbit and now I 
see it as a duck”, what changes is the way of looking at the 
figure. However, for an aspect-blind person, when s/he 
says “I saw a rabbit and now I see a duck there”, what 
changes is the object. For him or her what changes is not 
the way of looking at things but the thing itself. It is inter-
esting topic to extend, but I have no more space for more 
consideration.

Value Theory: between Husserl’s Phenomenology and Moore’s 
Intuitionism 
Gemmo Iocco 
Parma, Italy | gemmo.iocco@gmail.com  
Abstract 
Although the ethical intuitionism and the phenomenological theory of value have been considered to be in some way incompati-
ble, both acknowledge the distinction between facts and value. Starting from this basic assumption in this paper I focus on the 
ethical accounts proposed respectively by G.E. Moore and E. Husserl referring to the psychological-ethical model proposed by 
F. Brentano. Accordingly I argue that (a) Moore’s ethical intuitionistic approach is not able to clarify, within ethical considera-
tions, the fundamental difference between axiology and deontology and that the (b) Husserlian distinction between technical and 
practical dimension of moral reasoning represent a valid response to the difficulties arising from the fact-value distinction. 
 
 
One major theoretical issue that has dominated the field 
for many years impacts on whether value theory can be 
considered as an “area of moral philosophy that is con-
cerned questions about value and goodness of all varie-
ties” (Schroeder 2012). Indeed if a place were to be as-
signed to value theory in moral philosophy it might be de-
fined as an “axiological ethics” (Findlay 1970), where the 
term axiology is understood as the study of the ultimately 
worthwhile things. More precisely within axiology converge 
different problematic issues: ontological issues concerning 
what values are - proprieties (Moore 1903), objects (Mei-
nong 1917), ideal entities (Hartmann 1926), secondary 
qualities (McDowell 1985) - and epistemological issues 
aimed to demonstrate how and if you can understand and 
know values. However the multiple axiological accounts 
developed during the twentieth century have this in com-
mon: they focus on the evaluation of value-objects inas-
much as we not only feel the value of objects but we 
evaluate these objects and ultimately the feelings of value 
themselves (Urban 1909).  
In this paper I wish to compare two different ethical ap-
proaches that have historically been considered as alter-
natives: the intuitionistic account, grounded in Moore’s phi-
losophy and the phenomenological one proposed by 
Husserl. By this means I intend (a) to show how the thesis 
(Dummet 1993), according to which the analytical philoso-
phy is Austrian in origin, should also be applied to the 
value theory and (b) how, albeit starting from shared basic 
assumptions, the phenomenological account bridges a 
certain intuitionistic gap due to the impossibility of passing 
from the axiological level to the deontological one. There-
fore I would focus on the one hand on the implicit Moore’s 
distinction between facts and value and on the other hand 
on the Husserlian parallelisms between ethics and logic, in 
order to outline how a moral phenomenology could inter-
twine with an ethical intuitionism. An additional purpose of 
this paper is to show how a phenomenological ethical ac-
count can provide an important integration to a series of 
unresolved problems underlying the intuitionistic treatment 
of a theory of value. 
From the historical-philosophical point of view, both 
Moore and Husserl fit, in more or less direct ways, into the 
Brentanian tradition. In the Preface of his Principia Ethica 
Moore states “Brentano appears to agree with me com-
pletely (1) in regarding all ethical proposition as defined by 
the fact that they predicate a single unique objective con-
cept; (2) in dividing such propositions sharply into the 
same two kinds; (3) in holding that the first kind are inca-
pable of proof; (4) with regard to the kind of evidence 
which is necessary and relevant to the proof of the second 
kind” (Moore 1903).  
Husserl refers to Brentano’s Vom Ursprung sittlicher 
Erkenntnis in his 1914 Lectures entitled Grundfragen der 
Ethik und Wertlehre in trying to formulate the rules regulat-
ing the ranks relationships between values (Husserl 1988). 
Nevertheless both in part criticized the Brentanian ethical 
account. On the one hand Moore states that Brentano 
does not recognize the fundamental role within moral con-
siderations played by the principle of organic unity1; on the 
other hand Husserl points out as Brentano, on psychologi-
cal grounds, did not feel the necessity of a formal and ideal 
axiology, failing in this way to preserve the universal nature 
of axiological rules. We can state that Brentano shares 
with the intuitionists the basic assumption according to 
which “good” is given through a specific modality, namely 
an intuitive presentation, highlighting, in this way, the fun-
damental role played by the presentation, whereas Husserl 
focuses primary on the cognitive model proposed by Bren-
tano and specifically on the relationship between presenta-
tion, judgment, and what he calls Gemütsbewegungen - to 
which both feelings and desires belong. Accordingly Moore 
identified Brentano as the one who was able to draw the 
attention to fundamental ethical terms (good, bad) there-
fore laying the foundation for a correct moral approach; 
while Husserl takes up from Brentano the intentional na-
ture of the act making the moral experience possible, thus 
developing a more sophisticated theory of value-
experiences. 
1. Moore’s Ethical Intuitionism 
As already partially emerged in the previous discussion, 
the basic assumptions of an ethical intuitionistic approach 
are: a) the ethical judgments are concerned with a certain 
predicate ‘good’ and its converse ‘bad’; b) these judgments 
include universal judgments; c) good is  indefinable and 
simply a predicate. According to Moore good is a simple 
notion to the same extent as the notion of yellow but 
whereas yellow is a naturalistic notion, good is a non-
naturalistic notion. Accordingly, the common error in ethics 
has been thinking that it is sufficient to describe an object 
holding a determinate quality in order to know the quality 
itself. As Moore states “good then, if we mean by it that 
quality which we assert to belong to a thing, when we say 
that the thing is good, is incapable of any definition, in the 
most important sense of this word” (Moore 1903). The

naturalistic fallacy consists exactly in the belief that, in or-
der to define what good is, it is enough to describe its par-
tial qualities. This leads Moore to affirm that between facts 
and value exists a dichotomy, keeping therefore separate 
(a) the intuition the in everyday life allow us to know ob-
jects, states of affairs, events and (b) the intuition through 
which we can apprehend moral content. This is another 
way to propose again what it is called the Hume’s law ac-
cording to which there seems to be a significant difference 
between descriptive statements (about what is) and pre-
scriptive or normative statements (about what ought to be). 
Problems arise in getting from descriptive statements to 
prescriptive.  
It seems to me that an intuitionistic ethical account, such 
as that proposed by Moore, gets stuck in a critical-
deconstructive level of research, causing it to stop where it 
starts. As far as the constructive-phase of Moore’s ethics is 
concerned, the introduction of the concept of intrinsic value 
represents only a lexical enrichment, which does not add 
to effective theoretical understanding. Indeed the distinc-
tion between intrinsic and instrumental - or extrinsic - value 
presupposes the possibility of a mereological structure of 
the value formulated through the principle according to 
which the value of a whole must not be assumed to be the 
same as the sum of the values of its parts and defining this 
value-whole as an organic unity. The organic whole ac-
count points out the idea of a quality belonging to a phe-
nomenal whole independently from the proprieties of its 
individual parts; they refer to a specific ontological struc-
ture different from the mere summation of its parts. The 
possibility of an objectively grounded value theory goes 
hand in hand with the individuation of a specific account of 
intrinsic value considered as the highest point within an 
axiological hierarchy. Analysing the notion of intrinsic value 
(Moore 1922), Moore states that the assessment of value 
depends on the presentation and the value of an object is 
grounded in the evaluative proprieties of such object; 
whilst these proprieties differ from the descriptive one nev-
ertheless they have established a certain relationship with 
them. This point alone is significantly problematic since it 
could be suggesting the idea that between facts and val-
ues there is not a real dichotomy but a certain relationship 
that the intuitionistic approach is not able to identify.  
Moreover, from the methodological point of view, one of 
the most debated hypothesis proposed in order to make 
the passage from the descriptive to normative possible, is 
the introduction of an isolation approach (Chisholm 1986): 
this process should enable the definition of an objectively 
account of intrinsic value adopting a choice criterion in 
terms of intrinsic preferability. As Chisholm states “the iso-
lation approach not only yields adequate definitions of the 
basic intrinsic value concepts but has the following advan-
tage as well: it provides a way of reducing the concept of 
the theory of value (axiology) to those of ethics (deontol-
ogy)”. Certainly, Chisholm is right in arguing in favour of a 
basic intrinsic value concept. However, it seems to me that 
also the concept of “intrinsic preferability” refers to a sub-
jective dimension insofar as the valuing subject formulates 
it and thus the perplexity around the use of the concept of 
organic unity can be shared (Dancy 2003).  
2. A Phenomenological Theory of Value 
If we now turn to the ethical account proposed by Husserl 
also in order to show the basic assumption of a phenome-
nological ethical approach would be compatible with the 
intuitionistic one, we can start with these quotations “Theo-
rie führt keine Werte” (Husserl 1988), “Ein Werten ist doch 
kein Anschauen” (Husserl 1988). This means that the 
theoretical reasoning is unable to give us values because 
Husserl considers that there is a specific process - Wert-
nehmung - allowing us to grasp value. Such process is an 
intentional act and it is, in a certain sense, specific to per-
ception-act. Indeed values are perceptible but not in the 
same sense in which we perceive a house or a dog.  
There is another important aspect that leads us to con-
sider the proximity between an intuitionistic theory of value 
and a phenomenological one. Just as intuitionism affirms 
that we must separate the extrinsic values from intrinsic 
values the Husserlian phenomenology invites us to distin-
guish between valuable objects of different kinds (Rinofner 
2013): namely between intrinsic forms of value [Endwerte] 
and bearer of these respective values [Mittelwerte]. More 
specifically, Husserlian theory of value is defined formalis-
tic since it focuses on a priori rules regulating the moral 
judgments, whilst at the same time considering the inten-
tional relationship as the basic structure of all acts of con-
sciousness, taking into account the contents of these 
judgments. Strictly speaking, judging [Urteilen], valuing 
[Werten], willing [Wollen] are three classes of acts and 
they respectively refer to objects [Gegenstände], values 
[Werte] and goals [Ziele]. Thus these acts are costitutive 
operations performed by the ego, as Husserl states “gehen 
wir aber zurück auf die Subjektivität, so sind in ihr Urteilen, 
Werten, Wollen untrennbar verbunden, kein Subjekt ist 
denkbar ohne Akte all dieser Klassen, und somit undenk-
bar ohne Beziehung auf Gegenstände, auf Werte, auf Zie-
le”: (Ms. F I 40/150a). Between these three classes of acts 
exists a foundation-relationship: willing-acts are grounded 
on feelings acts and these in turn are grounded on intellec-
tual acts. As already partially emerged in the previous dis-
cussion, Husserl recalls the Brentanian idea according to 
which the feelings are endowed with intentional nature and 
he distinguishes between objektivierende Akte and nicht-
objektivierende Akte. The objectifying acts are intellectual 
acts: they simply refer to an object or state of affairs while 
feelings, wishes belong to the non-objectifying class, they 
do not contribute to the reference to the object but instead 
determine the manner in which the object is presented 
(Melle 1990).  
Thereby in Husserl’s phenomenology, ethics and logic 
have a symmetrical position: on the one hand, both have a 
normative function since they can formulate universal 
rules, whilst on the other hand they have a practical di-
mension since both are technical discipline. The logic is 
the technical discipline of judging aimed at the truth 
whereas ethics is the technical discipline [axiology] of will-
ing and behaving and its specific object is correct conduct. 
In the logical reasoning also, the formal conditions of a 
truth are independent from the content-moments [Sachge-
halt] of the statement; the rules, regulating the axiological 
sphere, must be considered as independent of the content 
to which they refer. Affirming the necessity of this separa-
tion Husserl stresses the fundamental difference within an 
axiological science between a pure axiological science 
[reine axiologische Wissenschaft], dealing with the general 
value rules [Wesengesetze der Werte], and a concrete 
axiological science [konkrete axiologische Wissenschaft] 
dealing with the concrete values. If a pure axiological sci-
ence has a formal legality, a concrete science of value is 
possible only through abstraction (Husserl 1988) consid-
ered as a viewing [Schauung] act allowing us to arrive to 
general concepts.

Concluding remarks 
After outlining the fundamental features of ethical intuition-
ism proposed by Moore and of a phenomenological theory 
of value, the following conclusions can be drawn from the 
present research: ethical intuitionism and a phenomenol-
ogical theory of value show to have some similarities re-
garding the distinction between facts and values but 
whereas the ethical intuitionism merely take over the in-
definability of fundamental moral terms as “good”, “bad” 
etc., the phenomenological account, proposed by Husserl, 
keeps separate from the ontological point of view facts and 
value, striving, at same time, to develop a cognitive model 
able to show the possible correlations between these dif-
ferent ontological regions. From the formal point of view 
this highlights the need, within an ethical intuitionistic con-
sideration, to appeal to the concept of intrinsic value in or-
der to characterize a meaning of good by virtue of its in-
trinsic proprieties; however this necessity must overlook 
the difficulties connected with a concept that cannot be 
understood as a mere sum of its constituent parts. This 
leads us to conclude that a formal theory of value, accord-
ing to which part and whole are formal essences applica-
ble to any material domain, could represent an answer to 
the aporias characterizing an intuitionistic ethical account.

Facts in Ethical Space: Wittgenstein on the Waxing and Waning of 
the World

Athens, GA, USA | rjagnow@uga.edu  
Abstract 
Many interpreters of Wittgenstein have argued that the Tractatus expresses a type transcendental idealism about ethics and 
moral value. Yet, most of these interpreters ascribe to Wittgenstein only what I will call a “cautious” transcendental idealism, ac-
cording to which value is constituted by the transcendental subject, but not instantiated in the world. In this paper, I have two 
goals. I first argue that such a cautious transcendental idealism is inconsistent with Wittgenstein’s remarks in Tractatus 6.43. I 
then show that we can avoid this problem if we ascribe to him a “bold” transcendental idealism, according to which value is not 
only constituted by the transcendental subject, but also, in a way to be clarified, instantiated in the world. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Many interpreters of Wittgenstein have argued that the 
Tractatus expresses a type transcendental idealism about 
ethics and moral value.1 Even though the Tractatus has 
received many other interpretations, including realist, phe-
nomenalist, and resolute readings, the transcendental ide-
alist interpretation is still a very powerful contender. Not 
only was Wittgenstein strongly influenced by Schopen-
hauer and familiar with Kant’s Kritik der reinen Vernunft, 
but he also seems to affirm his allegiance to transcenden-
tal idealism in the Tractatus when he writes, for example, 
that “[l]ogic is transcendental.” Yet, many interpreters who 
accept Wittgenstein’s transcendental idealism ascribe to 
him only what I will call a “cautious” transcendental ideal-
ism, according to which value is constituted by the tran-
scendental subject, but not instantiated in the world.2 In 
this paper, I have two goals. I first argue that a cautious 
transcendental idealism is inconsistent with Wittgenstein’s 
remarks in Tractatus 6.43. I then show that we can avoid 
this problem if we ascribe to Wittgenstein a “bold” tran-
scendental idealism, according to which value is not only 
constituted by the transcendental subject, but also, in a 
way to be clarified, instantiated in the world.3 
2. Cautious Transcendental Idealism 
For the purpose of this paper, I will state cautious tran-
scendental idealism as a combination of two claims: 
(i) value is constituted by the transcendental subject 
(ii) value transcends the world, that is, it is not 
instantiated in the world  
Clause (i) expresses the transcendental and clause (ii) the 
cautious aspect of this position. A bold transcendental ide-
alist accepts clause (i) but modifies clause (ii).  
One of the most important reasons for reading Wittgen-
stein’s remarks on ethics and value as expressing a type 
of transcendental idealism comes from the Tractatus’ 
treatment of the subject. In 5.641, Wittgenstein writes: 
                                                      
1 I want to emphasize that this is a broad generalization that ignores many 
differences between these authors’ views, and, of course, between Wittgen-
stein’s transcendental idealism and Kant’s. Transcendental idealist interpreta-
tions can be found in Hacker (1972), Pears (1987), Moore (2003, 2013), Jac-
quette (1998), Stockhoff (2002), Rudd (2004), Schroeder (2006), and Ap-
pleqvist (2013). 
2 Authors who ascribe a cautious transcendental idealism to Kant include 
Hacker (1972), Jacquette (1998), Schroeder (2006), and Appleqvist (2013). 
3 Authors who ascribe a bold transcendental idealism to Wittgenstein include 
Stockhoff (2002) and Rudd (2004).  
The philosophical I is not the man, not the human body 
or the human soul of which philosophy treats, but the 
metaphysical subject, the limit – not part of the world. 
In this passage, he explicitly acknowledges the existence 
of a metaphysical subject. The metaphysical subject is the 
limit of the world. This limit is not part of the world, but 
rather transcends it. Moreover, in the Notebooks, Wittgen-
stein clearly connects this transcendent subject with the 
possibility of ethics. He writes: “Good and evil only enter 
through the subject. And the subject does not belong to 
the world, rather it is the boundary of the world” (NB 
2/08/16). The metaphysical subject is thus not just tran-
scendent, but also transcendental. As the condition for the 
possibility of good and evil the metaphysical subject is a 
transcendental subject. Wittgenstein also seems to confirm 
this view in the Tractatus when he writes: “Ethics is tran-
scendental” (6.421). 
Wittgenstein further makes clear that the aspect relevant 
for the constitution of value is the transcendental will. In 
6.423, he writes: “Of the will as the bearer of the ethical we 
cannot speak. And the will as a phenomenon is only of 
interest to psychology.” Given Wittgenstein’s overall view 
in the Tractatus, the first sentence of this quote is most 
plausibly interpreted as meaning that there is a will that is 
the bearer of the ethical; but, as such, it belongs to the 
realm of literal non-sense. The transcendental will is not a 
fact in the world, but rather that aspect of the transcenden-
tal subject which constitutes ‘good and evil,’ or, more gen-
erally, ‘value.’  
In the brief passage from the Notebooks that I just 
quoted, Wittgenstein states that good and evil enters 
through the subject. One might therefore interpret him as 
saying that the transcendental will’s activity leads to the 
instantiation of value in the world. Yet, many interpreters 
who accept Wittgenstein’s transcendental idealism are 
cautious here. The reason for this is Tractatus 6.41, where 
Wittgenstein states: 
The sense of the world must lie outside of the world. In 
the world, everything is as it is and happens as it does 
happen. In it there is no value – and if it were, it would 
be of no value. . . . It must lie outside the world. 
The conclusion here seems unambiguous: value lies out-
side of the world of facts.4 Wittgenstein seems to confine 
ethics and value to the transcendental subject. Ethics is 
nothing other than a certain standpoint or attitude taken by

the transcendental subject towards the world as a whole. It 
is a way of contemplating the facts from the point of view 
of eternity. 
3. The Conflict between the Cautious Inter-
pretation and Tractatus 6.43 
To ascribe to Wittgenstein a cautious transcendental ideal-
ism comes at a high price because it requires us to inter-
pret his remarks in Tractatus 6.43 in a rather implausible 
way. Wittgenstein writes:  
The good and bad willing can only change the limits of 
the world, not the facts; not the things that can be ex-
pressed in language. In brief, the world must thereby 
become quite another. It must so to speak wax or wane 
as a whole. The world of the happy is quite another 
than the world of the unhappy.  
In order to reconcile this passage with cautious transcen-
dental idealism, we would have to accept at least the fol-
lowing two related claims:  
(i) The ‘good and bad willing’ changes the 
transcendental subject as the limit of the world. But, 
since willing does not lead to the instantiation of 
value in the world, the world remains unchanged. 
(ii) When Wittgenstein states that the world ‘waxes or 
wanes’ and that ‘the world of the happy is quite 
another than the world of the unhappy,’ he speaks 
metaphorically, saying only that the happy and the 
unhappy view the world differently.  
But these two claims are problematic, especially for the 
defender of a transcendental idealist reading of the Trac-
tatus.  
The first claim is in conflict with Wittgenstein’s remarks 
about solipsism. In 5.64, Wittgenstein writes: 
Here we see that solipsism strictly carried out coincides 
with pure realism. The I in solipsism shrinks to an ex-
tensionless point and there remains the reality coordi-
nated with it.  
If we identify the ‘I in solipsism’ with the transcendental 
subject, we can interpret this passage as follows. The 
transcendental subject shrinks to an extensionless point 
because it determines the logical space of facts. The tran-
scendental subject is thus an internal limit of the world. If 
this is correct, it would be implausible to ascribe to Witt-
genstein the view that the ethical limits of the world are 
external limits. But if the ethical limits are internal limits of 
the world, the transcendental will cannot affect the tran-
scendental subject without also affecting the world.  
The first claim also faces a second problem. If one wants 
to speak meaningfully of the subject as the limit of the 
world, one cannot just say that it exists outside of the word 
of facts. The subject can only be the limit of the world if it 
actually limits the world in some way. Otherwise, Wittgen-
stein could have rejected the notion of a metaphysical sub-
ject, as some interpreters have urged. But the proponent 
of a transcendental idealist reading of the Tractatus cannot 
endorse this conclusion.  
The second claim that the difference between the world 
of the happy and the world of the unhappy lies exclusively 
in how the transcendental subject views the world is also 
problematic. If Wittgenstein had wanted to say this, he 
could have used more straightforward language. He could 
simply have said that the happy and the unhappy view the 
world of facts differently. Moreover, in the Tractatus, Witt-
genstein never speaks of the transcendental subject’s sub-
jective point of view. This, as I suggested above, would 
also be inconsistent with the idea that solipsism’s truth is 
identical with realism. And, finally, in the Notebooks, Witt-
genstein states: “The world of the happy is a happy world” 
(NB 29/07/16). 
4. Facts in Ethical Space 
We can avoid the problems raised by passage 6.43 if we 
ascribe to Wittgenstein a bold transcendental idealism with 
regard to ethics and value. I think the best way to do so is 
to say that, according to Wittgenstein, the transcendental 
will adds an ethical dimension to the world.5 This proposal 
is motivated by Wittgenstein’s treatment of logic space. In 
1.13, Wittgenstein states that “The facts in logical space 
are the world.” The term ‘logical space’ here refers to the 
possible ways in which simple objects can combine with 
each other in order to form facts, which are determined by 
the dimensions of logical space. Similarly, I would suggest 
that there is an ethical space, and that whether a fact is 
good or bad is determined by that fact’s position relative to 
the ethical dimension. This is a bold transcendental ideal-
ism because it acknowledges that value is instantiated in 
the world.  
Let me add two qualifications. First, logical space, ac-
cording to Wittgenstein is a possibility-space. As such, it 
determines which combinations of simple objects are pos-
sible and which combinations are impossible. Ethical 
space, in contrast, determines which possible combina-
tions of simple objects, that is, which possible facts, are 
good and which are bad. In other words, ethical space cuts 
the space of possible facts into two sub-spaces. Second, 
logical space is a discrete space. Every combination of 
simple objects is either possible or impossible. Ethical 
space, I suggest, is also a discrete space. Every possible 
fact is either good or bad. The reason for why I think this is 
correct comes from the “Lecture on Ethics,” where Witt-
genstein argues that moral value is absolute, rather than 
relative.  
In order to reconcile transcendental idealism with Witt-
genstein’s remarks in 6.43, we have to construe the di-
mensions of logical and ethical space as independent di-
mensions. As an illustration consider the three spatial di-
mensions represented by a Cartesian system of coordi-
nates. A central feature of such a coordinate-system is that 
any point can occupy any position on any of the three co-
ordinate axes, independently of its position on the two 
other axes. The three spatial dimensions are entirely inde-
pendent of each other. I suggest that we construe the logi-
cal and the ethical dimensions of the world similarly as in-
dependent dimensions.  
With this suggestion in hand, we can avoid the implausi-
ble interpretations of Tractatus 6.43. First, it is now possi-
ble to maintain that the transcendental will changes the 
transcendental subject as the limit of the world without 
changing the world of facts. The transcendental will adds 
an ethical dimension to the world. But, since this dimen-
sion is independent from the logical dimension, it leaves 
the world of facts, that is, everything that can be expressed 
in language, unchanged. Second, it is now also possible to 
maintain that ‘the good and the bad willing’ changes the 
world so that it ‘waxes and wanes’ and becomes ‘quite an-
other,’ as Wittgenstein puts it. By constituting the ethical 
dimension, the transcendental will maps every possible 
                                                      
5 For similar suggestions, see Stockhoff (2002, 231) and Rudd (2004, 53). 
The proposal developed in this paper is compatible with both of their views.

fact onto the good or the bad, thus changing the world as a 
whole. Third, it is a direct consequence of this that ‘the 
world of the happy is quite another than the world of the 
unhappy.’ The happy and the unhappy world differ from 
each other because the possible facts occupy different 
positions with regard to the ethical dimension. 
5. Two Objections Considered 
Let me conclude by considering very briefly two possible 
objections to this interpretation. First, in 6.41, Wittgenstein 
writes: 
If there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside of 
all happening and being-so. For all happening and be-
ing-so is accidental. What makes it non-accidental can-
not lie in the world for otherwise this would again be ac-
cidental. 
Very roughly, the argument here is the following: Value is 
necessarily non-contingent. Yet, all facts in the world are 
contingent. Therefore, value must lie outside of the world. 
Since bold transcendental idealism puts value back into 
the world, it seems to be unable to secure the non-
contingent character of value. 
In response, we can say that Wittgenstein only claims 
that it is contingent which facts obtain and which do not 
obtain. The ethical dimension, however, assigns value to 
all possible facts. In this sense, it assigns value non-
contingently. Moreover, the ethical dimension is consti-
tuted by the transcendental subject, which, as we have 
seen, cannot be identified with a subjective point of view 
on the world. Thus, it does not make sense to say here 
that the dimension of ethical space is itself contingent. 
Contingency presupposes the possibility of other points of 
view. 
In the Notebooks, Wittgenstein states that “good and 
bad are predicates of the subject, not properties of facts” 
(NB 02/08/16). One might therefore worry that the present 
interpretation treats values as properties of facts. In re-
sponse, I suggest that facts instantiate value not in the 
sense of instantiating some intrinsic property. Rather, they 
instantiate value in virtue of having been assigned value 
by the transcendental subject.

A Case Study: Are Philosophical Claims Justified by Intuitions? 
Masashi Kasaki

Abstract 
The orthodox view in the recent methodology of analytic philosophy is that intuitions play a central role in justifying or falsifying 
philosophical claims or theories. In this paper, I attempt to argue against the orthodox view through a case study. The cases I 
examine are the Gettier cases and the gypsy lawyer case. I describe how these cases are presented and diagnose what fea-
tures are relevant to their acceptance or refusal in epistemology. My case study suggests that philosophers have a general ten-
dency to take cases seriously only on well-established, principled grounds. Hence, my case study provides evidence for the de-
nial of the orthodox view. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
It is a hot topic in the recent methodology of analytic phi-
losophy whether and to what extent philosophical claims or 
theories can be justified or falsified by intuitions. Although 
the orthodox view is that intuitions play a central role in 
justifying or falsifying philosophical claims or theories, 
some recently question the orthodox view on various 
grounds. It is difficult to assess the orthodox view and its 
denial; in order to fully assess them, it needs to be settled 
what nature, source, content, and object intuitions have, 
but there has been no agreement on these features of in-
tuitions. In addition, the precise assessment of the ortho-
dox view and its denial requires specifying what it is for a 
philosophical theory or claim to be justified or falsified in 
the way that is relevant to philosophical practice. 
Notwithstanding these difficulties, in this paper, I attempt 
to argue for the denial of the orthodox view—viz., that in-
tuitions plays little role in justifying or falsifying philosophi-
cal claims or theories—, through a case study. My case 
study consists in investigating how epistemologists take on 
two hypothetical cases regarding knowledge and alleged 
intuitions about them. The relevant kind of intuition I am 
concerned with is a spontaneous, truth-apt propositional 
attitude toward a hypothetical case, carrying at least the 
information that a philosophically important property ob-
tains or fails to obtain—e.g., that a subject has knowledge. 
This characterization of the relevant kind of intuition is 
general enough to cover what is at stake in the debate in 
philosophical methodology. Since my case study here is 
limited in number and scope, it might seem too hasty to 
draw a general conclusion about philosophy. I agree that 
more case studies are needed, and mine is only meant to 
be the first step to make up for a lacuna in philosophical 
methodology; Cappelen (2012) and Deutsch (2010) argue 
for the denial of the orthodox view by studying philoso-
phers’ uses of the terms ‘intuition’ and ‘intuitive,’ but such a 
study only gives indirect evidence for what philosophers do 
in their epistemic practice. The best way to settle the de-
bate between the proponents and the critics of the ortho-
dox view is by looking at how philosophers receive and 
discuss hypothetical cases and alleged intuitions about 
them. 
The cases I examine in this case study are Gettier’s 
(1963) cases and Lehrer’s (1971) gypsy lawyer case. I 
shall describe how each case is presented and diagnose 
what features are relevant to its acceptance or refusal by 
epistemologists. These cases capture philosophers’ gen-
eral tendency to take cases seriously only on well-
established, principled grounds. Hence, the case study 
provides evidence for the denial of the orthodox view. 
2. Gettier Cases 
Gettier offers two cases (the Gettier cases) as counterex-
amples to the sufficiency of the JTB conditions for knowl-
edge: these are cases in which S has justified true belief 
that p, but does not know that p. The Gettier cases are 
often treated as representative of the justificatory use of 
intuitions in philosophy. On the standard understanding of 
the Gettier cases, then, the falsity of the JTB analysis is 
justified by the intuition the content of which at least in-
volves the information that S does not know in each case, 
although it remains controversial what additional informa-
tion the intuition carries or what semantic content it has. 
It should be noted, however, that Gettier’s construction 
of the Gettier cases starts with a very careful articulation 
about justification as it is specified in the JTB analysis: 
I shall begin by noting two points. First, in that sense of 
‘justified’ in which S’s being justified in believing P is a 
necessary condition of S’s knowing that P, it is possible 
for a person to be justified in believing a proposition that 
is in fact false. Secondly, for any proposition P, if S is 
justified in believing P, and P entails Q, and S deduces 
Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction, 
then S is justified in believing Q. (Gettier 1963, 121) 
More precisely, Gettier offers two principles about justifica-
tion that are consistent with the JTB analysis: 
Fallibility: It is possible for S to be justified in believing a 
false proposition p. 
Closure: Necessarily, if S believes that p, p entails q, 
and S believes q on the basis of deduction from p to q, 
then S is justified in believing that q. 
The Gettier cases satisfy Fallibility and Closure; they are 
cases in which a possible subject justifiably believes a 
false proposition p and forms a true proposition q as a re-
sult of deduction from p to q. Indeed, infinitely many other 
cases than the Gettier cases can satisfy Fallibility and Clo-
sure. This suggests that Gettier uses the Gettier cases 
merely for illustrative purposes. If this interpretation is cor-
rect, Gettier does not only negatively offer the Gettier 
cases as counterexamples to the JTB analysis, but also 
proposes positive conditions for ignorance. Insofar as the 
JTB conditions for knowledge are consistent with Fallibility 
and Closure, and Fallibility and Closure are jointly suffi-
cient for ignorance, it follows that the JTB analysis is false. 
The question is, then, how it is justified that Fallibility and 
Closure are jointly sufficient for ignorance. If it is justified 
by intuitions regarding the Gettier cases, it is true after all 
that Gettier appeals to intuitions in justifying his negative

145
claim that the JTB analysis is false. However, I have reser-
vations to accept this. First, even if the sufficiency of Falli-
bility and Closure for ignorance is justified by intuitions of 
some kind, they may not be about particular cases of igno-
rance; intuitions about principles, like those that are often 
regarded to justify mathematical or logical rules, may be in 
play in justification for the sufficiency of Fallibility and Clo-
sure for ignorance. Second, even if it is justified by intui-
tions about particular cases, they may not be intuitions 
about hypothetical cases. There are infinitely many cases 
that satisfy Fallibility and Closure, many of which are ac-
tual (and possible but not far-fetched); there are a host of 
actual cases in which S believes a false proposition q as a 
result of deduction from a false proposition p. Third, the 
sufficiency of Fallibility and Closure for ignorance may be 
justified by principled reasons. For example, consider an 
instance of both Fallibility and Closure in which S falsely 
believes that q as a result of deduction from a false propo-
sition p. Since q is false, it is not a case of knowledge. A 
plausible way to make it a candidate case of knowledge is 
by modifying it in such a way that q is true. The result of 
this modification is a Gettier or similar case. But the modi-
fication requires a tricky setting in which q happens to be 
true even though it is deduced from a false proposition. 
The modified case is not merely unusual or far-fetched; 
more importantly, it lacks explanation of why it is to be 
taken as a case of knowledge, as opposed to the original, 
unmodified case. This lack of explanation may suffice to 
justify the claim that S does not know that q in the modified 
case, just as S does not in the original, unmodified case. 
Fourth, it might seem that the same sorts of considerations 
as I have offered above show that the JTB analysis is justi-
fied either by intuitions about actual cases or principles or 
on some principled grounds. But if both the sufficiency of 
the JTB conditions for knowledge and the sufficiency of 
Fallibility and Closure for ignorance are justified, then the 
relevant question is which is better justified in the context 
of the epistemological inquiry into the conditions for knowl-
edge and ignorance. The intuitions about the Gettier cases 
have little to contribute to the answer to this question; they 
do not add to the plausibility of Fallibility and Closure being 
sufficient for ignorance. 
3. Gypsy Lawyer Case 
Lehrer (1971) offers the gypsy lawyer case against the 
causal theory of doxastic justification: S has doxastic justi-
fication for the belief that p only if that belief is caused or 
sustained by adequate reason for p. Lehrer contends that 
the gypsy lawyer case is a case of knowledge but it does 
not satisfy the causal condition for doxastic justification. 
Since the other relevant conditions for knowledge are all 
satisfied in the gypsy lawyer case, it is construed as a 
counterexample to the causal theory of doxastic justifica-
tion. The case goes as follows: 
The example involves a lawyer who is defending a man 
accused of committing eight hideous murders… There 
is conclusive evidence that the lawyer’s client is guilty 
of the first seven murders. Everyone, including the law-
yer, is convinced that the man in question has commit-
ted all eight crimes. … However, the lawyer is a gypsy 
with absolute faith in the cards. One evening he con-
sults the cards about his case, and the cards tell him 
that his client is innocent of the eighth murder. He 
checks again, and the cards give the same answer. He 
becomes convinced that his client is innocent of one of 
the eight murders. As a result he studies the evidence 
with a different perspective as well as greater care, and 
he finds a very complicated though completely valid line 
of reasoning from the evidence to the conclusion that 
his client did not commit the eighth murder. … This rea-
soning gives the lawyer knowledge. Though the reason-
ing does not increase his conviction—he was already 
completely convinced by the cards—it does give him 
knowledge. … Indeed, and this is the crucial point, if it 
were not for his unshakable faith in the cards, the law-
yer himself would be swayed by those emotional factors 
and would doubt that his client was innocent of that 
eighth murder. It is only because of his faith in the cards 
that the reasoning gives him knowledge. (Lehrer 1971, 
311-2) 
While the gypsy lawyer case and Lehrer’s intuition that the 
lawyer knows are endorsed by several non-causal theo-
rists about doxastic justification, most causal theorists are 
not moved by them. Pollock and Cruz (1999, 79, fn. 69) 
note that “we do not find [Lehrer’s] counterexample per-
suasive”, and Swain (1981, 91) remarks that “I see no 
ground for claiming that the gypsy lawyer has knowledge”. 
Although Goldman (1979, 22, fn. 8) finds the gypsy lawyer 
case “unconvincing” and claims that “it seems intuitively 
wrong to say that [the lawyer] knows”, he suggests that his 
reason for disagreeing with Lehrer is that the lawyer’s be-
lief is fixed sorely as a result of the cards. As a matter of 
fact, the gypsy lawyer case is barely seriously discussed in 
the recent literature on doxastic justification. I see at least 
three reasons for this. First, as Swain says, Lehrer offers 
no ground for the lawyer’s knowledge of the client’s inno-
cence. Second, it is very difficult to pin down what princi-
ples or conditions make the case an instance of 
knowledge. It is not just that Lehrer offers no ground; even 
worse, it seems that no one can easily do so. Third, the 
salient features of the case is, as Goldman points out, that 
the lawyer bases his belief on blind faith in the cards. 
However, beliefs formed or sustained on the basis of blind 
faith are (at least usually) not cases of knowledge. There 
reasons jointly suggest that the causal theorists’ complaint 
is justified by Lehrer’s failure to offer principled reasons for 
his intuition that the lawyer has knowledge. Lehrer’s intui-
tion can do nothing to rebut this complaint. 
4. Against the Orthodox View 
For lack of space, I have only discussed the Gettier cases 
and the gypsy lawyer cases. To brief one more case, con-
sider the barn façade case proposed by Goldman (1976). 
Many epistemologists have accepted this case as a kind of 
Gettier-like case in which S’s justified true belief does not 
amount to knowledge, and constructed one or another 
theory of knowledge to account for it. Recently, however, 
several epistemologists have expressed a doubt on the 
case, and even contend that S knows therein (e.g., Sosa 
2007, Lycan 2006). Gendler and Hawthorne (2005) argue 
by way of examples that the intuitions concerning the barn-
façade case and similar cases are unstable, and it is very 
difficult to articulate principles underlying the intuition that 
S does not know in the barn façade case. Greco (2009) 
assimilates this difficulty to that of the generality problem 
for reliabilism. These epistemologists are aware of the fact 
that the intuition about the case is relatively strong and 
widely shared, but find the case controversial. This is be-
cause of the lack of principled ground for why S fails to 
know in the case. 
Although I certainly need more case studies, the case 
study here suggests the following: 
(a) As opposed to the standard understanding, the Get-
tier cases are not paradigmatic examples of the justifi-
catory use of intuition. 

A Case Study: Are Philosophical Claims Justified by Intuitions? | Masashi Kasaki 
 
 
 146
(b) Cases merely supported by intuitions are unconvinc-
ing or at least controversial. 
I submit that these reflect a general tendency of philoso-
phers to accept cases and accompanying intuitions only 
on well-established, principled grounds. Hence, I conclude 
against the orthodox view that intuitions play little role in 
justifying or falsifying philosophical claims or theories.

Transcendentalism as a Special Type of Philosophizing: Kant’s 
transcendental Shift, Dasein–Analysis of Heidegger and Sachverhalt–
Ontology of Wittgenstein 
Serguei L. Katrechko 
Moscow, Russia | skatrechko@gmail.com 
Abstract 
In this paper, we attempted to consider Kant’s transcendental philosophy as a special type of philosophizing (resp. new tran-
scendental paradigm), which differs both from the ‘object’ metaphysics of Antiquity and ‘subject’ metaphysics of the Modern Age 
(transcendent — transcendental — immanent metaphysics). For this purpose, we introduce such methodological terms as tran-
scendental shift [B 25] and transcendental perspective. The basis for such representation of transcendentalism is cognitive and 
semantic reading of the Critique and theory of ‘two aspects’. While in classical metaphysics, cognition is interpreted as a relation 
between empirical subject and object, in transcendental metaphysics, ‘possible experience’ (Erfahrung) shall be understood as 
a relation between transcendental subject and object. However, Kant considers the subject and the object uncritically, in the 
substance modus and their transcendental rethinking in existential (Dasein; Heidegger) and event-ness (Sachverhalt; Wittgen-
stein) mode will allow taking the next important step towards development of transcendental paradigm of philosophizing. 
 
 
In the second half of the XXth century the second (after 
Neo-Kantianism) ‘discovery’ of Kant, associated with con-
ceptual change in the understanding of transcendentalism 
— the transition from the traditional ontological theory of 
“two objects/worlds” to the theory of “two aspects” (Rohlf, 
2010) based on epistemic reading of Critique, arises. In 
this regard, R. Hanna writes that the development of con-
temporary philosophy (in the face of two major traditions: 
analytic and continental ones) is largely predetermined by 
Kant’s transcendentalism, and the ХХth century may be 
named as the post-Kantian century (Hanna, 2007). 
M. Foucault echoes him; he says that Kant “stands at the 
beginning of a new method of philosophizing." This allows 
us to consider Kant's transcendentalism not just as one of 
the particular philosophical theory, but as the basis of a 
new — transcendental — paradigm of philosophy (phi-
losophizing)
1. 
As the starting point for our interpretation of the tran-
scendentalism we take the classical paradigm of episte-
mology, for which the main question is the relation of a 
subject to an object what can be represented in binary 
scheme S(ubject) – O(bject). On this scale we also mark 
the result of our knowledge or of the interaction between 
the subject (S) and the object (O) in the process of cogni-
tion – the experience (or experienced knowledge; germ. 
Erfahrung)
2, which is located in the middle of the scale. In 
this case the original binary scheme turns into a ternary 
one: S — Erfahrung — О. 
According to key [В 25] of Critique, where transcendental 
philosophy (TPh) is defined as “…knowledge which is not 
so much occupied with objects as with the mode of our 
cognition of these objects, so far as this mode of cognition 
is possible a priori”, the transition to transcendentalism is 
based on transcendental ‘shift’ from [empirical] studies of 
the objects (things) to the right side of the scale in the di-
rection to the subject, but rather into the intermediate be-
tween subject and object area of experienced knowledge, 
— which is the area of the transcendental-ness. In this 
case the transcendental shift does not displace the inten-
tion of study to the right limit to the analysis of the [empiri-
cal] subject, i.e. does not immerse us in the study of the

rary transcendentalism: http://transcendental.ucoz.ru/forum/.

content of consciousness, but stops at the middle area of 
the transcendental-ness, which Kant calls “the mode of 
cognition” or “faculty of cognition”
3. On the epistemic scale 
it is represented as follows:  
 
The comparison of the transcendental with the empirical or 
the distinction between empirical and transcendental per-
spectives (H. Allison) is crucial for the understanding of the 
transcendental-ness. If empirical perspective believes the 
knowledge we get to be the result of affection of our sensi-
bility, 
the 
transcendental 
perspective 
believes 
the 
knowledge to be the result of our faculty of cognition. 
In this case the crucial thesis of transcendentalism 
should be noticed, that our [empirical] knowledge contains 
some a priori components, i.e. any experience comprises 
both experienced and inexperienced components. There-
fore, it should be considered a more subtle distinction be-
tween the a priori and the transcendental. In this regard it 
worth mentioning the change in the definition of TPh: in the 
2nd ed. of Critique not a priori concepts (1st ed.) but our a 
priori mode of cognition is the object of TPh. Thus “late” 
Kant does not equate transcendental to a priori, but under-
stands it as the possibility of a priori [knowledge]. In this 
regard we should pay attention to Kant’s remark in [В80–
1], which states that “not all a priori knowledge should be 
[included]” in the area of transcendental, but only the 
knowledge of its (1) possibility and (2) use in the experi-
ence, i.e. objective significance of a priori. Although Kant 
understands the possibility of a priori, inter alia, as its 
epigenesis [В 91, 118–9, 127–8, 167], but the essence of 
transcendental-ness is associated with (2), i.e. with oppor-
tunity to apply a priori in empirical cognition. Therefore, if a 
priori can be correlated with the subjective realm of con-
sciousness, the transcendental correlates with the area of 
‘Erfahrung’: this is not Cartesian “innate ideas” but trans-
                                                      
3 Also see Kant’s notes from Prolegomena: «The word "transcendental," 
which with me means a reference of our cognition, i.e., not to things, but only 
to the cognitive faculty…».

subjective principles which constitute our “mode of cogni-
tion”: 
Thing — (empirical) — Erfahrung — (a priori) — Consciousness 
                                (transcendental) 
Thus Kant's characteristic of transcendentalism as the re-
search of our “mode of cognition” should be understood 
not subjective-psychologically, in terms of analysis of our 
faculties of cognition and/or solution of the problem of 
(epi)genesis of a priori, but cognitive-semantically as a so-
lution of the problem of objectiveness of a priori represen-
tations, i.e. the possibility of their use in experience. Kant 
tells about the ‘semantic’ orientation of transcendentalism 
in a letter to M. Herz (21.02.1772), in which he at the first 
time explicates the idea of his Critique as a response to 
the following ‘semantic’ question: “What is the ground of 
the relation of that in us which we call ‘representation’ 
to the object?” Thus the Kant’s position or transcendental-
ism in the narrow sense is connected with the solution of 
“the main transcendental question” about the objectivity 
of a priori representations, which are located in the 
middle of the epistemic scale
4, while the metaphysics de-
veloped by Kant's appears as metaphysics of possible ex-
perience. 
*** 
However, the described first phase of the transcendental 
shift does not yet characterize the specifics of Kant's tran-
scendentalism, but sets a range of a la transcendental 
concepts. This “withdrawal” of subject and object in favor 
of some primary in respect of the subject and object given-
ness occurs, for example, in Empiriocriticism, Marxism, 
Popper’s three-worlds-theory and other non-classical phi-
losophical systems. Thus Kant stands at the origins of the 
transcendental paradigm of philosophizing, the transition 
to which is connected with overcoming both objectal (An-
tiquity) and a subjectal (Modern Era) points of view and 
moving of intention of research to the middle between ob-
ject and subject area which Kant associates with experi-
ence/Erfahrung. 
It worth noting that the concept of the mature Plato is the 
first ancestor of this type of philosophizing, where ideas 
are postulated as a necessary component of cognition 
without which a person “will have nothing on which his 
mind can rest; and so he will utterly destroy the power of 
reasoning" (Plato, Parmenides, 135 с). Further this inten-
tion was developed by Husserl as Kant’s transcendental 
shift can be interpreted as a return to some pre-reflective 
state of mind in the act of cognition, in which neither sub-
ject nor opposing to it object are not differed yet, and al-
though the intention of our [intentional according to 
Husserl] consciousness is directed on an object, but the 
phenomenal givenness of experience, which is the incep-
tion of our knowledge, is the primary givenness for it
5. Ac-
cordingly, subject and object presuming by classical para-
digm as primary ones appear as secondary entities in 
transcendental paradigm of philosophizing. 
If the thing appears to be the main object of the study of 
ancient paradigm of philosophy, i.e. the metaphysics of a 
thing/object is developing (transcendent metaphysics; 
meta–physics), and the consciousness/cogito appears to 
be the object of the classical paradigm of Modern Era (re-
                                                      
4 This complies with the theory of "two aspects" in which the Kantian thing-in-
itself and thing-as-it-appears-to-us are considered not as two distinct ontologi-
cal entities, but as "two sides" [В XIX footnote] or "two modes of representa-
tion (the sensible and the intellectual)" ([В XXVII]; resp. empirical and tran-
scendental perspectives) of the same thing. 
5 Accordingly, the Kantian shift could be called the transcendental-
phenomenological one, and Kantian Erfahrung can be correlated with Hus-
serl’s “intentional reality”. 
spectively, the metaphysics of a ‘subject’ (immanent meta-
physics; meta–psychology) is developing), than the middle 
area of ‘Erfahrung’ is the object of transcendental type of 
philosophizing, which is exampled in the transcendental-
ism (transcendental metaphysics) of Kant: 
 
*** 
We now proceed to further analysis of Kant's transcenden-
tal shift, to the analysis of his second — metaphysical — 
phase, with which the specifics of Kant’s own transcenden-
talism should be linked. This specifics is largely predeter-
mined by Kant to build his “experimental” metaphysics (by 
analogy with the experimental science of Modern Era) 
“new method of thought” (B XVIII), or transcendental 
method (Cohen, Natorp). 
Like any metaphysical method, the transcendental 
method is in the universalization of the empirically given by 
its liberation from particular conditions. Actually beginning 
from Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, etc) any field of science 
(meta-physics) deals with the kind of “overcoming of em-
pirical”, but the specific of “scientific” transcendental meta-
physics comparing with the previous “school” metaphys-
ics
6, is largely (though not completely) predetermined by 
the fact that the object of its generalizations is not a thing 
or consciousness, but experience. Transcendentalism acts 
as metaphysics of experience.  
However, the determining thing for the ‘new method of 
thought’ of the Kantian transcendentalism that distin-
guishes it from traditional metaphysics is that this is not 
only the subject which changes, but also the style of phi-
losophizing and foremost, the way of introducing meta-
physical abstractions. Traditional metaphysics, being 
traced back to Aristotle, is a doctrine about essence, which 
is positioned as something meta-physical, i.e. as funda-
mentally unobservable under-lying-ness in the base (‘sub-
stance’) of the sensuously given. For Kantian “experimen-
tal” metaphysics the methodological differentiation of ‘real 
— possible’ is the essential one. The transcendental-ness, 
unlike the empirical-actual-ness, acts as possible. In this 
sense, Kant builds the metaphysics of possible experi-
ence, which acts as the transcendental generalization of 
empirical experience. Such status of the transcendental-
ness ensures its apodictic character: transcendental prin-
ciples are correct not only for our, but for any of the possi-
ble worlds. Transcendental-metaphysical, unlike essential-
metaphysical, acts as a “horizontal” functional generaliza-
tion of given empirical pattern that brings transcendental-
ism close not to physics, but mathematics. 
As a result of this, the empirical subject and object are 
converted to, respectively, the transcendental subject 
(transcendental unity of apperception; TUA) and tran-
scendental thing/object (TO), the relation between which 
predefines the possible experience. Or, considering the 
primacy of experience, the possible experience is concep-
tualized by Kant as “interaction” of transcendental object 
and subject. In this case TUA and TO are introduced by 
Kant in a correlative manner: «the transcendental unity of 
apperception that all the manifold, given in intuition is 
united into a conception of the [transcendental] object» 
                                                      
6 “Critique stands in the same relation to the common metaphysics of the 
schools, as chemistry does to alchemy, or as astronomy to the astrology…” 
(Kant, Prolegomena).

[B 140]
7. Schematically the full transcendental ‘shift’ can 
be represented as follows: 
 
In this case the transition to the transcendental perspective 
is associated with transcendental generalization of empiri-
cal experience, in the result of which the structure of 
"transcendental S — transcendental O", encompassing 
the empirical relation S – O, is formed: 
transcendental S — { empirical S — empirical О } — transcendental O 
However, Kant’s “subjective” and “objective” things-in-
themselves, which act as kind of left and right limits of the 
epistemic scale, should be distinguished from transcen-
dental subject and object. The thing-in-itself and noumenal 
‘I’ are not transcendental but transcendent. According to 
Kant, their function is negative and is to specify all the 
cognitive scale the same way as a numerical scale is given 
through marks "plus" and "minus" of infinity (+∞ and –∞), 
i.e. to mark the limits of our possible cognition. At the same 
time they are inaccessible for cognition. Transcendental 
subject (TUA) and object (TO) as the constitutive elements 
of the possible experience on the scale are between em-
pirical-phenomenal (immanent) and transcendent. Consid-
ering this, the Kantian transcendental shift can be repre-
sented as follows: 
 
*** 
In conclusion, we outline one of the possible lines of de-
velopment of Kantian transcendentalism. Despite the at-
tractiveness of his approach, Kant was unable to avoid 
“dogmatic” directives, the chief of which is connected with 
the substantial understanding of both subject and the ob-
ject (of cognition). And so, following Kant, we should raise 
the question of their transcendental conditions (“How is the 
subject (object) possible?”). Heidegger, his Dasein–
analysis, answers the first of these questions. The subject 
does not exist on its own, but in its existential “environ-
ment.” Wittgenstein answers the second of these ques-
tions in his “Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus”, where he 
develops Sachverhalt–ontology (Katrechko, 2009). And 
Wittgenstein’s thought surprisingly resonates with Heideg-
ger's: the thing does not exist on its own, the ontological 
“environment” of other things is the condition of its exis-
tence, embeddedness of a thing in co-existence
8. In the 
light of the TUA and TO Kant should be re-understood in 
existential and event-ness (Sachverhalt) modes, which will 
enable us to make the next important step in the develop-
ment of the transcendental paradigm of philosophy (see 
the scheme below). 
                                                      
7 Comp. with characteristics [А 250–1]. Let us note that the Kantian transcen-
dental thing/object stands as objective function of our representation of the 
world and lies (together with categories) as a base of the transcendental on-
tology, the essence of which can be expressed by the thesis: “We cognize not 
[physical] things, but we cognize the phenomena ‘thing-ly’ [objectively]” 
(E. Cassirer).  
8 That is why, by the way, the analytic and continental philosophies are com-
patible with each other!

Die Vermischten Bemerkungen und das Manuskript MS 168 
Peter Keicher 
Wien, Österreich | p_keicher@hotmail.com 
Abstract 
Im ersten Teil dieses Beitrags wird auf ein Manuskript Wittgensteins hingewiesen, das mit der von G.H. von Wright für die Ver-
mischten Bemerkungen gewählten editorischen Vorgehensweise methodisch unmittelbar in Verbindung steht. Im Manuskript 
MS 168 hat Wittgenstein selbst eine Auswahl von Bemerkungen zusammengestellt, wie sie aus den Vermischten Bemerkungen 
bekannt sind. Alle von Wittgenstein für dieses Manuskript ausgewählten Bemerkungen sind in den beiden Manuskriptbänden, 
denen sie entnommen sind, durch die gleichen Randzeichen gekennzeichnet. Es handelt sich dabei um senkrechte Striche zu 
Beginn und am Ende der jeweiligen Bemerkungen. Dadurch stellt sich die Frage, ob die Manuskriptquellen der Vermischten 
Bemerkungen ähnliche formale Kennzeichnungen oder Randzeichen aufweisen. Im zweiten Teil folgen zunächst einige allge-
meine Angaben zu den noch kaum genauer erforschten Randzeichen in Wittgensteins Nachlass. Im dritten Teil werden die Er-
gebnisse einer Studie zu den unterschiedlichen formalen Kennzeichnungen und Randzeichen der Manuskriptquellen der Ver-
mischten Bemerkungen zusammengefaßt. Dabei geht es auch um die Frage, ob und inwieweit solche formalen Kennzeichnun-
gen und Randzeichen zur Konzeption einer möglichen erweiterten Neuedition der Vermischten Bemerkungen beitragen können. 
 
 
1. Das Manuskript MS 168 
Das am 16.1.1949 in Dublin begonnene Manuskript MS 
168 ist ein Notizbuch mit linierten Blättern, das auf zwölf 
beschriebenen Seiten insgesamt 23 Bemerkungen enthält, 
von denen 21 Bemerkungen den beiden von 1947 bis 
1949 entstandenen Manuskriptbänden MS 136 (Band Q) 
und MS 137 (Band R) entnommen wurden. Am 15.1.1949 
hatte Wittgenstein den Manuskriptband MS 138 (Band S) 
begonnen. Etwa gleichzeitig zum Beginn dieses neuen 
Bandes hatte Wittgenstein mit MS 168 also die Absicht, 
auf der Grundlage früher notierter Bemerkungen ein ei-
genständiges Manuskript zu verfassen.  
Die erste Bemerkung des MS 168 entstand offenbar un-
ter Vorlage einer Bemerkung aus MS 137, S. 140b, vom 
5.1.1949. In MS 168 wurde diese Bemerkung jedoch neu 
formuliert und ergänzt. Für die zweite Bemerkung des MS 
168 gibt es in MS 137 keine wörtlichen Entsprechungen. 
Am 17.1.1949 notierte Wittgenstein in MS 138: 
Ein mittelmäßiger Schriftsteller muß sich hüten, einen 
rohen, inkorrekten Ausdruck zu schnell durch einen kor-
rekten zu ersetzen. Dadurch tötet er den ersten Einfall, 
der doch noch ein lebendes Pflänzchen war. Und nun 
ist er dürr und gar nichts mehr wert. Man kann ihn nun 
auf den Mist werfen. Während das armselige Pflänzlein 
noch immer einen gewissen Nutzen hatte. (MS 138, S. 
2a) 
Nach dieser Bemerkung geht Wittgenstein in MS 168 dazu 
über, ausgewählte Bemerkungen aus MS 136 und MS 137 
nahezu wörtlich abzuschreiben. Dabei beginnt er zun-
nächst mit Bemerkungen aus MS 137. Erst im Anschluß 
an die aus MS 137 ausgewählten Bemerkungen folgen 
Bemerkungen aus dem früher entstandenen MS 136. Alle 
von Wittgenstein für MS 168 ausgewählten Bemerkungen 
sind in MS 136 und MS 137 mit zwei senkrechten Strichen 
„|...|“ zu Beginn und am Ende der Bemerkung gekenn-
zeichnet. Die Themen dieser Bemerkungen entsprechen 
denen der Vermischten Bemerkungen. In den Vermischten 
Bemerkungen sind auch alle Bemerkungen des MS 168 
veröffentlicht. Dabei folgte G.H. von Wright jedoch nicht 
der Anordnung der Bemerkungen in MS 168, sondern der 
Folge ihrer Entstehungszeit in den Manuskriptbänden MS 
136 und MS 137. Mit Sicherheit kannte G.H. von Wright 
jedoch das Manuskript MS 168, denn auch die ersten bei-
den Bemerkungen des MS 168, für die keine wörtlichen 
Übereinstimmungen in anderen Manuskripten existieren, 
sind in den Vermischten Bemerkungen veröffentlicht. 
Noch während der Arbeit an MS 168 notierte Wittgen-
stein in MS 138 am 18.1.1949 eine Bemerkung, auf die 
von Wright indirekt mit dem Titel Culture and Value Bezug 
nimmt. 
Mein eigenes Denken über Kunst und Werte ist weit 
desillusionierter, als es das der Menschen vor 100 Jah-
ren sein konnte. Und doch heißt das nicht, daß es des-
wegen richtiger ist. Es heißt nur, daß im Vordergrund 
meines Geistes Untergänge sind, die nicht im Vorder-
grund jener waren. (MS 138, S. 4a) 
Im Vergleich zu den Vermischten Bemerkungen macht MS 
168 jedoch den Eindruck eines Fragments. Obwohl der  
Manuskriptband MS 136 (Band R) und andere Bände der 
alphabetischen Reihe noch zahlreiche weitere mit zwei 
senkrechten Strichen „|...|“ gekennzeichnete Bemerkungen 
enthalten, bricht Wittgenstein das Manuskript MS 168 nach 
zwölf Seiten mit der folgenden Bemerkung ab: 
Rosinen mögen das Beste an einem Kuchen sein; aber 
ein Sack Rosinen ist nicht besser als ein Kuchen; und 
wer im Stande ist, uns einen Sack voll Rosinen zu ge-
ben, kann damit noch keinen Kuchen backen, ge-
schweige, daß er etwas Besseres kann. 
Ein Kuchen, das ist nicht gleichsam: verdünnte Rosi-
nen. (MS 168, S. 6v) 
Offenbar war Wittgenstein damals mit der ursprünglichen 
Zielsetzung nicht mehr zufrieden, für MS 168 nur gleich-
sam philosophische „Rosinen“ auszuwählen. 
2. Randzeichen in Wittgensteins Nachlaß  
In der Werkausgabe der Schriften Wittgensteins werden 
Wittgensteins Randzeichen nicht wiedergegeben, in der 
Wiener Ausgabe der Schriften Wittgensteins sind sie voll-
ständig wiedergegeben. Wittgensteins Randzeichen sind 
zwar noch kaum genauer erforscht, darum sollte man sie 
aber keinesfalls als den Gegenstand einer Geheimwissen-
schaft betrachten. Diese Zeichen erfüllen stets einen prak-
tischen Zweck, der meistens mit der Auswahl von Bemer-
kungen für die Typoskripte verbunden ist. Der weitaus 
größte Teil dieser Randzeichen findet sich deshalb auch in 
jenen Manuskriptbänden, deren Bemerkungen Wittgen-

stein für Typoskripte verwendet hat. Rein numerisch be-
trachtet besteht wahrscheinlich mehr als die Hälfte der 
sehr zahlreichen Randzeichen in Wittgensteins Nachlass 
aus einem kurzen diagonalen Schrägstrich „/“, der eine für 
das Diktat vorgesehene oder für das Diktat dann auch ta-
sächlich verwendete Bemerkung kennzeichnet, je nach-
dem, ob der Schrägstrich zur Vorbereitung des Diktats 
oder beim Diktat selbst eingetragen wurde. Ein weiteres 
sehr häufiges Randzeichen ist ein „s“, das für Bemerkun-
gen verwendet wurde, deren Verwendung beim Diktat 
Wittgenstein fraglich erschien. Je nach Schreibsituation 
wurden mit „s“ gekennzeichnete Bemerkungen beim Diktat 
ausgelassen, oder es wurden auch einige dieser Bemer-
kungen in das jeweilige Typoskript übernommen. 
Nicht selten kennzeichnete Wittgenstein auch einzelne 
Bemerkungen zum gleichen Thema, die in den Manuskrip-
ten in größeren Abständen notiert worden waren, um sie 
beim Diktat thematisch zusammenzufassen. Für solche 
Kennzeichnungen waren weitere, im Vergleich zu „/“ oder 
„s“ jedoch seltenere Randzeichen erforderlich, z.B. Kreise 
„o“, senkrechte Striche „|...|“ zu Beginn und am Ende von 
Bemerkungen, oder auch Buchstaben wie „C“, „K“ oder „v“. 
Oft dienen auch runde oder eckige Klammern zur Unter-
scheidung bestimmter Bemerkungen von der „eigentli-
chen“ philosophischen Gedankenentwicklung. Die glei-
chen Randzeichen können je nach Kontext und Schreibsi-
tuation unterschiedliche Funktionen erfüllen. Bei Diktaten 
aus mehreren Manuskripten, oder aus Manuskripten, die 
unterschiedliche Themen behandlen, sind die Randzei-
chen wichtiger und zumeist auch häufiger als bei Dikaten 
aus nur wenigen oder thematisch einheitlichen Manuskrip-
ten. 
Einige Randzeichen werden nur während bestimmter 
Werkphasen verwendet und sind im Nachlaß ansonsten 
kaum mehr zu finden. So kennzeichnet z.B. von 1929 bis 
1930 das Sternchen „*“ in den Manuskripten MS 105-108 
die beim Diktat des TS 208 und TS 210 ausgelassenen 
Bemerkungen. Nach 1930 hat Wittgenstein dieses Rand-
zeichen kaum mehr verwendet. In MS 106 finden sich 
1929 einige „\“, die später äußerst selten sind. Allerdings 
wird „\“ zumeist zu Kontrollzwecken häufig in Kombination 
mit „/“ verwendet, was zu einem „X“ führt, das tatsächlich 
in zwei unterschiedlichen Arbeitsphasen entstand. Nahezu 
alle Kombinationen von Randzeichen stehen mit unter-
schiedlichen Arbeitsstufen in Verbindung.  
Das Randzeichen des Kreises „o“ verwendet Wittgen-
stein nur von 1929 bis 1931, vor allem in MS 107-112. Da-
nach wird dieses Randzeichen von nur sehr wenigen Aus-
nahmen abgesehen nicht mehr verwendet. Der Kreis dient 
als Randzeichen in MS 107 zunächst der Zusammenfas-
sung philosophischer Themen, die an unterschiedlichen 
Stellen notiert, entsprechend gekennzeichnet und in TS 
208 zusammengefaßt wurden. Dies läßt sich durch die 
beiden in TS 212 erhaltenen S. 167-168 des nur unvoll-
ständig erhaltenen TS 208 belegen, die auf MS 107, S. 
271-288 zurückgehen, und ähnliches gilt auch für MS 108. 
In MS 109 betreffen die mit einem Kreis gekennzeichneten 
Bemerkungen vor allem die Bemerkungen „zu einem Vor-
wort“ (MS 109, S. 204), die nicht in das TS 211 übertragen 
wurden, in MS 110 die sogenannten Frazer-Bemerkungen, 
die größtenteils in TS 211 diktiert wurden.1 In MS 111 
                                                      
1 Es gibt keine Hinweise darauf, daß sich diese Bemerkungen „zu einem Vor-
wort“ den Thesen von Josef Rothhaupt entsprechend (Rothhaupt, 2013) auf 
ein Publikationsprojekt beziehen könnten, das aus einer Zusammenfassung 
oder einer Auswahl der mit einem Kreis gekennzeichneten Bemerkungen 
bestünde. In diesen Bemerkungen spricht Wittgenstein auch von seinem „frü-
heren Buch“ (MS 109, S. 212, 8.11.1930) und es darf als nahezu ausge-
schlossen gelten, daß er der Logisch-Philosophischen Abhandlung eine Publi-
kation gegenüberstellen wollte, die aus Bemerkungen zur Ethnologie, Anthro-
pologie oder aus nur einigen wenigen, eher beiläufig notierten, den Vermisch-
gleicht sich die Funktion des Kreises wieder MS 107 an, 
wie dies z.B. aus MS 111, S. 138-140 und TS 211, S. 89-
91 oder auch MS 111, S. 170-191 und TS 211, S. 124-127 
hervorgeht, und in MS 112 findet sich nur noch eine mit 
einem Kreis gekennzeichnete Bemerkung. Gleichzeitig 
werden in den Manuskripten MS 107-112 jedoch auch 
mehrere Bemerkungen mit einem Kreis gekennzeichnet, 
die Ähnlichkeiten mit den Vermischten Bemerkungen auf-
weisen. Etwa 30 dieser Bemerkungen sind in den Ver-
mischten Bemerkungen veröffentlicht. 
Im Unterschied zum Randzeichen des Kreises, dessen 
Verwendung auf drei Jahre und nur wenige Manuskripte 
beschränkt blieb, finden sich die insgesamt etwa 200 mit 
senkrechten Strichen gekennzeichneten Bemerkungen zu 
Beginn und am Ende der jeweiligen Bemerkung in mindes-
tens 41 Manuskripten nahezu des gesamten Nachlasses 
von 1930 bis 1951. Die ersten senkrechten Striche „|...|“ 
finden sich MS 108, S. 268, 30.6.1930. Es ist jedoch frag-
lich, ob man die senkrechten Striche als Randzeichen be-
zeichnen sollte. In gewisser Weise erinnern diese Striche 
auch an runde oder eckige Klammern und tatsächlich läßt 
sich nachweisen, daß einige der morphologischen Vorfor-
men dieser senkrechten Striche unmittelbar im Kontext der 
Verwendung von Klammern entstanden sind (MS 154, S. 
10r), sowie in Kombination mit senkrechten Linien über 
mehrere Zeilen am linken Seitenrand. Zu diesen Vorfor-
men gehören auch doppelte senkrechte Striche vor einer 
jeweiligen Bemerkung, die sich bereits in MS 107, S. 278, 
finden. In MS 112 wird 1931 die Funktion des Randzei-
chen des Kreises durch zwei senkrechte Striche „|...|“ zu 
Beginn und am Ende der jeweiligen Bemerkung ersetzt. 
Mit senkrechten Strichen werden auch zahlreiche Bemer-
kungen gekennzeichnet, die Ähnlichkeiten mit den Ver-
mischten Bemerkungen aufweisen. Etwa 90 dieser Be-
merkungen sind in den Vermischten Bemerkungen veröf-
fentlicht. Die späteste Verwendung senkrechter Striche zu 
Beginn und am Ende der Bemerkung findet sich in MS 
176, S. 55v, 16.4.1951. 
3. Die Vermischten Bemerkungen 
Für die Vermischten Bemerkungen hat Georg Henrik von 
Wright eine Auswahl von 486 Bemerkungen aus mindes-
tens 52 Manuskripten des Nachlasses zusammengestellt. 
Die Anordnung dieser Bemerkungen aus nahezu allen 
Werkphasen und Schaffensperioden Wittgensteins ent-
spricht im wesentlichen der chronologischen Folge ihrer 
Entstehungszeit. Da die vergleichsweise wenigen von 
Wittgenstein für MS 168 ausgewählten Bemerkungen in 
den Manuskriptbänden ausnahmslos mit zwei senkrechten 
Strichen „|...|“ gekennzeichnet sind, stellt sich die Frage, 
ob für die weitaus umfangreicheren Manuskriptquellen der 
Vermischten Bemerkungen ähnliche Kennzeichnungen zu 
finden sind. Eine erste Liste dieser Manuskriptquellen 
wurde von Alois Pichler zusammengestellt (Pichler, 1991) 
und bei bislang zwei Neueditionen der Vermischten Be-
merkungen verwendet (von Wright, 1994, 1998). Betrach-
tet man die Manuskriptquellen der Vermischten Bemer-
kungen anhand der Faksimiles der Bergen Electronic Edi-
tion, so zeigt sich eine für bestimmte Werkphasen teils 
gleichbleibende, insgesamt jedoch eher heterogene Ver-
wendung unterschiedlicher Randzeichen. Im folgenden 
werden die Manuskriptquellen der Vermischten Bemer-
kungen hinsichtlich der von Wittgenstein verwendeten 
Randzeichen und anderer formaler Kennzeichnungen be-
                                                                             
ten Bemerkungen ähnlichen Themen bestehen sollte. In den Bemerkungen 
„zu einem Vorwort“ stellt Wittgenstein sein philosophisches Werk in einen 
kultur- und geistesgeschichtlichen Kontext und eben darin besteht auch die 
Verwandtschaft zu den Vermischten Bemerkungen.

schrieben. Die Numerierung folgt der in der Werkausgabe 
bei Suhrkamp veröffentlichten Edition der Vermischten 
Bemerkungen (von Wright, 1984). 
Nr. 1 (1914-1917) 
Die erste Bemerkung der Vermischten Bemerkungen ist 
die einzige den von 1914 bis 1917 entstandenen soge-
nannten „Kriegstagebüchern“ MS 101-103 entnommene 
Bemerkung (MS 101, S. 7r, 21.8.1914). Wie für die tage-
buchartigen Aufzeichungen der Manuskripte MS 101-103 
kennzeichnend, ist diese Bemerkung in Geheimschrift ver-
faßt. 
Nr. 2-27 (1929-1930) 
Die folgenden 25 Bemerkungen (Nr. 2-26) sind den von 
1929 bis 1930 entstandenen Manuskriptbänden MS 105-
107 entnommen. Dort sind sie entweder in Geheimschrift 
verfaßt, oder sie wurden mit einem Sternchen „*“ gekenn-
zeichnet, das Wittgenstein damals zur Kennzeichnung von 
Bemerkungen verwendet hat, die beim Diktat der Ty-
poskripte nicht berücksichtigt wurden. Es folgt eine Be-
merkung (Nr. 27) aus MS 108 (S. 207, 29.6.1930), die mit 
einem Schrägstrich „/“ gekennzeichnet und von Wittgen-
stein der üblichen Funktion dieses Randzeichens enstpre-
chend in TS 210 diktiert wurde. 
Nr. 28-113 (1930-1933) 
Beginnend mit einer Bemerkung aus MS 109 (S. 28, 
22.8.1930) folgen Bemerkungen aus aus einigen Notizbü-
chern und aus den Manuskripten MS 109-112, von denen 
etwa 30 mit einem Kreis „o“ gekennzeichnet sind (Nr. 28-
87). Die letzte so gekennzeichnete Bemerkung stammt 
aus MS 112, (S. 140, 1.11.1931). Dazwischen finden sich 
jedoch etwa ebensoviele Bemerkungen, die teils in Ge-
heimschrift verfaßt, teils in runden oder eckigen Klammern, 
mit unterschiedlichen Randzeichen gekennzeichnet wur-
den, wie z.B. „/“ oder „s“, oder auch keinerlei formale 
Kennzeichnungen aufweisen. Unmittelbar im Anschluß an 
die letzte mit einem Kreis gekennzeichnete Bemerkung 
folgt in den Vermischten Bemerkungen die erste (Nr. 88) 
mit zwei senkrechten Strichen „|...|“ aus MS 112 (S. 154, 
1.11.1931). Die folgenden Bemerkungen, die noch in etwa 
bis zum Big Typescript (TS 213) von 1933 entstanden sind 
(Nr. 89-113), blieben zumeist ohne formale Kennzeichun-
gen, einige wenige sind in eckigen Klammern notiert. 
Nr. 114-264 (1933-1946) 
Die nach dem Big Typescript (TS 213) etwa bis zur „Ersten 
Hälfte der Vorkriegsfassung der Philosophischen Untersu-
chungen“ (TS 220) von 1933 bis 1937 entstandenen Be-
merkungen blieben zumeist ohne Randzeichen, einige 
wenige wurden in eckigen Klammern, zwischen senkrech-
ten Strichen „|...|“ oder in Geheimschrift notiert (Nr. 114-
143). Ähnliches gilt für die bis etwa zur „Zweiten Hälfte der 
Vorkriegsfassung der Philosophischen Untersuchungen“ 
(TS 221) entstandenen Bemerkungen (Nr. 144-177), wo-
bei für die Vermischten Bemerkungen aus MS 120 noch 
zwei mit einem Kreis „o“ gekennzeichnete Bemerkungen 
ausgewählt wurden, die zu den ausgesprochen seltenen 
Verwendungen dieses Randzeichen nach 1931 zählen 
(MS 120, S. 134, 135, 19.11.1938). Auch die bis zur sog. 
„Endfassung der Philosophischen Untersuchungen“ (TS 
227) entstandenen Bemerkungen blieben zumeist ohne 
formale Kennzeichung, nur einige wenige wurden durch 
senkrechte Striche „|...|“ gekennzeichnet, in eckigen 
Klammern oder auch in Geheimschrift notiert (Nr. 178-
264). 
Nr. 265-486 (1946-1951) 
Beginnend mit MS 130 (S. 244, 1.8.1946) wird für die Ma-
nuskriptquellen der Vermischten Bemerkungen in den Ma-
nuskripten MS 130-136 von 1946-48 vor allem das Rand-
zeichen „s“ verwendet, nur einige wenige Bemerkungen 
sind durch senkrechte Striche „|...|“ gekennzeichnet oder in 
Geheimschrift verfaßt (Nr. 265-387). In MS 136 kommt es 
1947-48 zu Kombinationen aus dem Randzeichen „s“, den 
senkrechten Strichen „|...|“ und beginnend mit MS 136, S. 
89, 10.1.1948, mit dem Buchstaben „C“. (Nr. 376) In MS 
137 werden 1948 die Kombinationen von „s“ und „C“ durch 
Kombinationen von „C“ und senkrechten Strichen „|...|“ 
ersetzt, bis schließlich fast nur noch die senkrechten Stri-
che „|...|“ verwendet werden (Nr. 388-446). In etwa zeit-
gleich mit dem Beginn des MS 168 sind mit dem Beginn 
des MS 138 ab Januar 1949 bis zu Wittgensteins letzten 
Schriften fast alle Manuskriptquellen der Vermischten Be-
merkungen mit senkrechten Strichen „|...|“ gekennzeich-
net, wobei jedoch auch mehrere Bemerkungen keinerlei 
formale Kennzeichnungen aufweisen (Nr. 447-486). 
Die Manuskriptquellen der Vermischten Bemerkungen 
enthalten 8 Bemerkungen mit dem Randzeichen „*“,31 
Bemerkungen mit dem Kreis „o“ als Randzeichen, 46 sind 
in Geheimschrift verfaßt, 90 sind mit zwei senkrechten 
Strichen „|...|“ zu Beginn und am Ende der Bemerkung ge-
kennzeichnet, 107 sind mit dem Randzeichen eines „s“ 
gekennzeichnet, etwa 200 Bemerkungen hat Wittgenstein 
ohne formale Kennzeichnung notiert, zahlreiche Bemer-
kungen wurden teilweise in Kombination mit unterschiedli-
chen Randzeichen in runden oder eckigen Klammern no-
tiert.  
Zusammenfassung 
Im Unterschied zu MS 168 weisen die sehr viel umfangrei-
cheren Manuskriptquellen der Vermischten Bemerkungen 
die Verwendung unterschiedlicher Randzeichen auf. Zwar 
lassen sich für manche Werkphasen gleichbleibende 
Randzeichen erkennen, wie z.B. das Randzeichen des 
Kreises „o“ von 1930-31, das Randzeichen „s“ von 1946-
48 oder senkrechte Striche „|...|“ von 1948-51, doch wäh-
rend anderer Werkphasen erscheint es unmöglich, eine 
direkte Verbindung zwischen den von Wittgenstein ver-
wendeten Randzeichen und der von G.H. von Wright für 
die Vermischten Bemerkungen getroffenen Auswahl her-
zustellen. Auch wenn ein Randzeichen für eine bestimmte 
Werkphase charakteristisch erscheint, enthalten die Ver-
mischten Bemerkungen aus der gleichen Zeit doch oft 
sehr zahlreiche Bemerkungen, die auf andere Weise ge-
kennzeichnet wurden oder auch keinerlei besondere 
Kennzeichnung erhielten. Für den Zeitraum von etwa fünf-
zehn Jahren von 1931-1946 enthalten die Manuskriptquel-
len der Vermischten Bemerkungen fast keine Randzei-
chen. 
So verführerisch die Vorstellung auch sein mag, in Witt-
gensteins Nachlass formale Kriterien für eine Auswahl der 
Vermischten Bemerkungen oder für eine Erweiterung die-
ser Edition zu finden, so unmöglich erscheint es, eine sol-
che Auswahl ausschließlich durch formale Kriterien zu be-
gründen. Wollte man z.B. alle Bemerkungen zusammen-
stellen, die als Randzeichen mit einem Kreis „o“, mit einem 
„s“ oder mit senkrechten Strichen „|...|“ gekennzeichnet 
sind, erhielte man aufgrund der zu verschiedenen Zeiten 
durchaus recht unterschiedlichen Funktionen dieser Rand-
zeichen ein thematisch heterogenes Ergebnis, das für 
mögliche Ergänzungen der Vermischten Bemerkungen 
deutliche Mängel an editorischer Differenziertheit enthielte. 
Die von G.H. von Wright für die Vermischten Bemerkun-
gen getroffene Auswahl dürfte sich deshalb durch eine 
genauere Beschäftigung mit jenen Bemerkungen, die darin 
enthalten sind, und solchen, um die die Vermischten Be-
merkungen erweitert werden könnten, als sehr viel klüger

erweisen, als vorschnelle Kritik dies erahnen mag. G.H. 
von Wrights Auswahl weist ein ausgesprochen hohes Maß 
an editorischem Feingefühl und außergewöhnlich präzise 
Kenntnisse der Entstehungsgeschichte der einzelnen 
Schriften auf. Die Verbindung von editorischer Differen-
ziertheit und besonderen Kenntnissen des philosophi-
schen Nachlasses Wittgensteins ist auch für Überlegungen 
bezüglich erweiterter Editionen der Vermischten Bemer-
kungen unverzichtbar.

Why Meaning Intentions are Normative 
Jon Keyzer 
Dunedin, New Zealand | jon.keyzer@postgrad.otago.ac.nz  
Abstract 
In “Why Meaning Intentions are Degenerate” (2012), Bilgrami argues that meaning intentions fail to be normative in any interest-
ing sense. I situate this argument with respect to the skeptical challenge posed by Kripke’s Wittgenstein (1982). I argue that Bil-
grami mischaracterizes the relevant meaning intention and thus misses the important normative dimension imparted by a 
speaker’s duty to be interpretable to others in his speech community. 
 
 
1. The Skeptical Paradox 
Kripke (1982) develops an argument to show there is no 
fact in virtue of which an ascription of meaning, such as 
‘Jones means addition by “plus”’, is true. Kripke’s Wittgen-
stein (KW) motivates the argument in the following exam-
ple: Suppose I have never performed the computation 
“68+57” (there much be some such example given the fini-
tude of computations I have performed). Though I have 
never performed this particular operation, I know perfectly 
well what to do with the two integers given my understand-
ing of the word “plus”. To know what “plus” means is to 
know that “plus” denotes addition and that addition is the 
correct function to perform for any two integers conjoined 
with the plus symbol. When queried with “68+57”, I add 68 
and 57 and report the sum—“125”. Now suppose that a 
bizarre skeptic approaches me and challenges my answer. 
The skeptic claims that I misunderstand my past usage of 
“plus” and should have answered “5”. The skeptic explains 
that in the past, I meant a deviant function quus by “plus”, 
where quus denotes this deviant function: 
x ⊕ y = x + y, if x, y are less than 57 
= 5                otherwise. 
Assuming my past computations involved no integer 
greater than 57, it is compatible with my past usage that by 
“plus” I meant quus: “Perhaps when I used the term 'plus' 
in the past, I always meant quus: by hypothesis I never 
gave myself any explicit directions that were incompatible 
with such a supposition” (13). This is because, the skeptic 
claims, there is “no fact about my past history—nothing 
that was ever in my mind, or in my external behavior—
establishes that I meant plus rather than quus” (13).  Sub-
sequently, the skeptic claims if there is no fact as to 
whether I meant plus or quus in the past, there can be no 
fact as to whether I mean plus or quus in the present. (13) 
Nothing in my past dictates the answer “125” as the one I 
ought to give presently. The devastating skeptical conclu-
sion then is that “When I respond in one way rather than 
another to such a problem as '68+57', I can have no justifi-
cation for one response rather than another . . . There can 
be no fact as to what I mean by 'plus', or any word at any 
time” (21). The skeptic does not deny the arithmetical fact 
that 68 and 57 yield the sum 125; he denies that there is 
any metalinguistic fact which determines whether I meant 
one function rather than another by the word “plus”. 
The skeptic's conclusion is absurd, but not logically im-
possible (9). It is open as to whether I meant plus or quus, 
so in order to justify the claim that I meant plus by “+” there 
must be some fact I can cite as determining that I did 
mean plus by “plus”. 
2. Two Constraints and the Normativity of 
Meaning 
According to KW's skeptic, any adequate account of my 
meaning must do two things: 
1. It must offer a candidate fact that would constitute 
my meaning plus and not quus. 
2. It must explain how that fact justifies my giving one 
answer rather than another, or determines that one 
answer rather than another is the answer I ought to 
give. 
Each constraint is driven by an assumption about the nor-
mative character of meaning. The first constraint demands 
some content that makes true that I meant one thing rather 
than another by my words. In particular, the skeptic wants 
to know what makes true that the addition, rather than 
quaddition, function maps onto my past use of “plus”. Any 
fact cited about my past meaning must be incompatible 
with the skeptical hypothesis that I meant quaddition all 
along. 
The skeptic’s first constraint depends on the normative 
platitude that the meaning of a word implies standards for 
the correct application of that word. This platitude is said to 
constitute the ‘norm-relativity’ of meaning (Hattiangadi 7). 
That is, the meaning of a word is relative to some norms of 
correctness and incorrectness. For example, the meaning 
of “plus” constitutes a standard that determines that certain 
uses are correct and others incorrect. Consequently, the 
very meaning of “plus” rules that “125” is the only correct 
answer to “68+57=?”. If I answer “5”, I answer incorrectly. 
If no such standard can be specified as to what I meant in 
the past, then no present response amounts to success or 
failure on my part. The very idea of a mistake is ruled out, 
for I could do no wrong if no standard dictates how “plus” is 
to be applied. It is only in accordance with a past standard 
that one answer counts as both correct and justified pres-
ently. The first and second constraints then are intimately 
connected—any fact that fails the first is a non-starter on 
the second. 
Assuming some fact is cited to meet the first constraint, 
the second constraint demands that this fact justify or 
compel the present answer “125”. If my past usage gives 
no intrinsic justifying reason to answer “125”, then I might 
as well say “5” just the same. Any semantic fact about my 
past must therefore be sufficiently normative in the 
stronger sense that it must dictate what I ought to do now 
and in the future. Assuming I had addition in mind, then 
two things are true when prompted with “68+57”: 

Why Meaning Intentions are Normative | Jon Keyzer 
 
 
 
155
(A) “125” is correct insofar as it uniquely accords 
with my past use of addition, and subse-
quently... 
(B) “125” is the only answer I ought to give. 
KW’s skeptic claims that no candidate for a meaning fact 
can successfully instate both (A) and (B). (A) is a neces-
sary condition for (B) and is equivalent to (B) if “correct” 
expresses a normative concept. Simply put, (A) + the as-
sumption that “correct” is normative = (B). If “correct” is not 
normative, then there can be no requirement that meaning 
facts determine facts about how expressions ought to be 
used. 
The skeptic’s demand extrapolates to language gener-
ally—an infinite number of skeptical analogs can be drawn 
against the use of any expression. The skeptic can, for 
example, challenge my past usage of the word “green” as 
it applies to green-colored things. Perhaps by “green”, I 
always meant grue, where grue is identical to green at 
times t
1-t
x in the past, but is identical to blue presently (t
y) 
or in the future (any time beyond t
y). If by “green” I meant 
grue, then I ought to answer “green” to the query “What 
color is the sky?” If no fact satisfies whether I meant grue 
or green by “green”, then we are left at the same impasse 
as with “plus”. No answer satisfies both normative con-
straints for any given expression, therefore there no fact 
determines what anyone means by anything. The whole 
enterprise of language seems to “vanish into thin air” (22). 
3. Meaning Intentions and the Radical Con-
clusion 
In “Why Meaning Intentions are Degenerate” (2012), Bil-
grami offers a radical challenge to the normative con-
straints posed by KW’s skeptic. Bilgrami claims that mean-
ing intentions fail to be normative even in the weak norm-
relative sense supposed by the skeptic. The reasons for 
this are tied to the concept of an intention: 
“the very idea of intention is such that it generates an 
ideal or norm of correctness, something by the light of 
which one can assess one’s actions for being correct or 
wrong, depending on whether they are or fail to be in 
accord with the intention” (97). 
An action is ‘right’ when it accords with an intention and 
‘wrong’ when it doesn’t. Intentions are normative then in 
the norm-relative sense targeted by the skeptic’s first con-
straint. Bilgrami claims this norm-relativity is “constitutive of 
intentional states” and a platitude of intention talk (97). 
How then does a meaning intention fail to be normative 
given the normative nature of intentions? If a meaning in-
tention is an intention at all, isn’t it normative? 
4. A Snake in One’s Path 
Bilgrami argues that the normativity of ordinary intentions 
does not carry over to meaning intentions: “meaning is not 
normative because, despite its intimate link with intention, 
it does not inherit the normativity that intentions possess . . 
. the normativity that intentions possess lapse when inten-
tions target meanings” (115). The assumption that mean-
ing is normative issues from a misunderstanding on two 
kinds of intentions: 
1. One utters the words “That is a snake” with the in-
tention of applying them to a snake in one’s path. 
2. One utters the words “That is a snake” with the in-
tention to say something that is true if and only if 
there is a snake in one’s path (101). 
Wittgenstein, Grice, and others misidentify the normativity 
of meaning as imparted by intentions like (1), according to 
Bilgrami (102). Intention (1) is normative and thus consti-
tutes a real intention, but this intention is not (strictly-
speaking) a meaning intention. If one says “snake” in the 
presence of rope (perhaps it is dark or the speaker is 
drugged), one makes no mistake with regard to the intent 
to say something with particular truth-conditions under cer-
tain circumstances. One merely expresses a false belief 
and therefore the mistake is epistemic, not semantic: 
“Even if a rope rather than a snake is present, one’s in-
tention to say something with certain truth-conditions 
(something which is true if and only if there is a snake 
there) is an intention that is impeccably met in these 
circumstances. The fact that there is a rope and not a 
snake, which is present in the vicinity, does not affect in 
the slightest the aptness of that intention about mean-
ing” (102). 
Intention (1) is adequately normative in virtue of the fact 
that one can fail the intention to say something true, but 
this normativity is ultimately epistemic. Let us turn to the 
kind of intention highlighted in (2). 
If (2) expresses the intention relevant to meaning, then 
that intention amounts to the intention to say something 
with a certain truth condition. If intention (2) is normative, 
then a mistake must be possible on that intention, i.e. in 
the sense of failing to comply with that intention. According 
to Bilgrami, the only candidate for such a mistake would be 
a failure in selecting the relevant truth-condition for a given 
expression. This would occur if one has the intention to 
express something with a certain truth-condition, but picks 
the wrong truth-condition: 
“the failure to fulfill that intention would presumably oc-
cur only if one failed to get right what their truth-
conditions are—as opposed to occurring when the 
truth- conditions, which one gets right, fail to hold (in 
our example, when there is no snake but a rope in front 
of one)” (103). 
I choose the wrong truth-condition, for instance, if I say 
“That is a snake” with the intention to say something that is 
true if and only if there is a rope in my path. The correct 
truth-condition mentions a snake, not a rope. 
Though semantic in kind, intention (2) fails to be norma-
tive. If one has the intention to say “snake” in the presence 
of rope, there is no mistake on the intention to say some-
thing with a particular truth-condition. So even if the truth-
condition is idiosyncratic (“snake” applies to x if x is a rope) 
or not satisfied (‘“snake” applies to x if x is a snake’ and x 
is a rope), one makes no mistake on the meaning of one’s 
words. Likewise: 
“The medically ignorant man who says “I have arthritis 
in my thigh,” therefore, though he certainly makes a 
mistake, makes a mistake about how the term is used 
in the social linguistic practice, especially among the 
medically informed experts. His own linguistic practice 
is not grooving with theirs. That is his only mistake, 
apart from the, ex hypothesi, medical ignorance. He 
makes no mistake of failing to act (speak) in accord 
with his meaning intentions. The words on his lips are 
intended by him to mean something that is true if and 
only if he has a disease of the joints or ligaments in his 
thigh, he says and thinks something that is both self-

known to him and something that is perfectly true” 
(106). 
We are led then, Bilgrami says, to the conclusion that a 
meaning intention is incorrigible: 
“intentions regarding meanings are a degenerate spe-
cies of intentions and the deepest reasons for this . . . 
have to do with the fact that meaning something is a 
rather unique kind of thing in that intending a meaning 
and living up to that intention are—to put it flamboyantly 
and perhaps a little perversely—more like one thing 
rather than two, and so failures are not really possible” 
(114). 
A speaker cannot mistake the meaning he takes his words 
to express and therefore his meaning intention is norma-
tive in no interesting sense. 
5. Norm-Relativity 
Bilgrami applies an analog of the norm-relativity (NR) plati-
tude in KW against any candidate for a normative meaning 
intention. Recall that KW’s skeptic depends on this princi-
ple: 
NR 
If there is a genuine standard that determines 
whether any use of an expression is correct or incor-
rect, then there is a distinction between a particular use 
as merely seeming correct and that use as actually be-
ing correct. 
Bilgrami finds that a meaning intention can make no such 
distinction between ‘seems right’ and ‘is right’: 
AB1 If x is a genuine normative intention, it has to be 
possible for you to try to comply with it but fail to do so. 
AB2 If one tries to comply with a meaning intention, 
one cannot fail to comply with that meaning intention. 
ABC A meaning intention is not a genuine normative 
intention. 
(AB1) is an analog of (NR). (AB2) states there can be no 
distinction between a speaker’s intent to mean something 
by his utterances and his living up to that intention. 
In the following I pose two ways to interpret Bilgrami’s 
conclusion and one way of rejecting the preceding argu-
ment. 
6. “Be Interpretable!”—Part of this Com-
plete Meaning Intention 
Bilgrami mischaracterizes the relevant meaning intention. 
Specifically, he fails to respect the fact that a meaning in-
tention is an intention to communicate something to other 
members of a speech community. One can always fail to 
comply with the intention to say something that is inter-
pretable to others and as such, having a meaning intention 
is a normative matter. 
A meaning intention is in part an intention to say some-
thing that is interpretable. One must comply with this inten-
tion by exercising the capacity to speak competently, i.e. in 
a way conducive to the understanding of others. McDowell 
takes this capacity to diffuse the skeptical problem: 
“McDowell allows “square” to appear within the scope 
of a content-specifying that-clause in the description of 
the ability possessed by a speaker who means square 
by “square”: it is the ability to use “square” so as to be 
understood by speakers of English to be expressing the 
thought that such-and-such is square (see McDowell 
1987: 102).” (Miller 15) 
According to Davidson, the exercise of a general ability 
such as this is central to a speaker’s duty to be interpret-
able. A speaker must enunciate, apply his words consis-
tently, and otherwise ease the interpretive process: 
“The best the speaker can do is to be interpretable, that 
is, to use a finite supply of distinguishable sounds ap-
plied consistently to objects and situations he believes 
are apparent to his hearer. Obviously the speaker may 
fail in this project from time to time” (Davidson 250). 
A speaker must do what is necessary to be interpretable to 
his audience, by doing his best to make himself under-
stood. And this is something he can surely fail to do, for 
instance, by saying the words “That is a snape” with the 
intention to say something that is true if and only if there is 
a snake in one’s path. Being interpretable requires some 
effort on the part of the speaker. 
If one is a competent speaker and has a meaning inten-
tion, then one has a general duty to be interpretable. This 
duty is one a speaker can fail and so having a meaning 
intention is a normative matter.

From Instrumental Facts to Final Values – Some Diagnostic 
Observations 
Peter P. Kirschenmann 
Amsterdam, Netherlands | jorakir@hotmail.com  
Abstract 
I critically discuss three “non-standard” views in formal axiology: (1) final values can be extrinsic; (2) instrumental values can be 
extrinsic final values; (3) instrumental values can be intrinsic. I suggest that many legitimate distinctions can be made, and I 
name a few relevant notions. I wonder about the broader implications of such notions and distinctions. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
There are important philosophical debates about substan-
tial values, e.g. about the nature of justice. One can doubt 
whether there are equally important controversies in what 
sometimes is called ‘formal value theory’, which concerns 
structurally characterized values. Well-known structural 
types of values are instrumental value, final value, and in-
trinsic value. The distinctions are based on different factual 
(structural) relationships. E.g., instrumental values have 
means-end relationships as basis; intrinsic values have 
their source in the things concerned themselves (cf. Kir-
schenmann 2011). 
Formal axiologists endeavor to determine the nature and 
interrelationships of structural types of value. They aim at 
conceptual precision and clarity and rely on common or 
intuitive usages of the notions concerned. Formal-
axiological claims are being defended or criticized by 
means of examples or counter-examples, which almost 
always have a heavy substantial content. 
An example of a conceptual clarification concerns the 
question: “Does scientific knowledge possess only instru-
mental value or also intrinsic value?” One notes that this is 
the wrong opposition: intrinsic must be opposed to extrin-
sic. While instrumental values are indeed extrinsic values, 
they are not the only ones (cf. Kirschenmann 2011). In-
strumental value is to be contrasted, though also corre-
lated, with final value. 
It is a well-known claim of G.E. Moore that all final values 
are intrinsic values. This claim, if true, would somehow 
save that “wrong opposition”. Yet, can it be upheld?  
The first view I shall discuss, says: No – there also are 
extrinsic final values. Secondly, I consider and reject the 
claim that instrumental value can be an extrinsic final 
value. Thirdly, I present and criticize the view that instru-
mental value can be intrinsic, and I rechristen some no-
tions. Lastly, I specify some correlative notions of final 
value.   
2. Final Values That Are Extrinsic 
Somewhat intuitively, something is said to have final value 
if it is valuable ‘for its own sake’, rather than for the sake of 
something else, or if it is valuable ‘as an end’. For Moore, 
something has intrinsic value if this value supervenes on 
its internal properties, its ‘intrinsic nature’. The final value 
of something, for Moore, must be an intrinsic value. 
Moore´s view has come under attack (cf. Rabinowicz 
and Rønnow-Rasmussen 1999). Several philosophers 
have argued that there also are non-intrinsic final values. 
Their general idea is that certain things can be valued for 
their own sake not just because of their internal properties, 
but also at least partly because of their relational proper-
ties. One example would be a rare stamp. It is being val-
ued partly, if not mainly, because of its rarity; and rarity is 
not an internal property of the stamp, but a relational or 
contextual feature. 
Many more examples of extrinsic final values can be 
given (cf. ibid., pp. 41ff.). A wilderness, untouched by hu-
mans, can be valuable in this way, inasmuch as untouch-
edness is a relational feature. So would be princess 
Diana’s dress: it is valuable, not just because of its own 
properties, but especially because it belonged to her.  
So, there are (at least) two kinds of final values: intrinsic 
and (partly) extrinsic ones. 
Moore’s claim raises other questions. Are the internal 
properties supposed to be essential properties? Could the 
claim be rescued by insisting that final values accrue, not 
to objects, but only to states of affairs, which internalize 
external relations of objects? 
I shall return to the notion of final value, after discussing 
its correlate, the notion of instrumental value. 
3. Instrumental Value: Strong and Weak? 
Toni Rønnow-Rasmussen (2002, 25) distinguishes two 
usages of ‘instrumental value’, a Strong evaluative sense: 
“S: ‘x has instrumental value’ means ‘x bears a (certain 
particular) value, and it bears this value only if x is con-
ducive to (the existence of something that has) a final 
value’.” 
And a Weak sense:  
“W: ‘x has instrumental value’ means ‘x is conducive to 
(the existence of something that has) a final value’.”  
He states that in “contrast to strong instrumental values, 
weak instrumental values do not belong to the category of 
value”. To me, this is a contradiction in terms. Rønnow-
Rasmussen tries to make his statement acceptable by ar-
guing that ‘being conducive to value’ need not imply ‘being 
valuable’ itself, adducing the amusing analogy that quick-
silver also is not silver.  
One of his examples of judgments about weak instru-
mental value is “this knife will be useful to make thin 
slices…” (ibid., 41). This is all right as an unqualified judg-
ment of usefulness, but not as an instrumental-value 
judgment. Only once the desired goal is getting thin slices, 
will the knife be judged a good knife, and a better one than

other knives, for that purpose. And this specific goodness 
for that purpose is its particular instrumental value. 
As a “candidate” for the label ‘Strong instrumental value’, 
Rønnow-Rasmussen (ibid., 26) presents Christine M. 
Korsgaard’s example of a mink coat, together with her 
claim that such a luxurious thing is valued for its own sake 
“under the condition of their usefulness”. Since the mink 
coat is valued for its own sake, he seems to consider its 
value as a final value; but since its value supervenes on its 
usefulness or instrumentality, he seems to consider its 
value also as extrinsic. So, referring to the notion of extrin-
sic value in the previous section, he claims that his strong 
instrumental value is a kind of extrinsic final value (or is it 
‘final extrinsic value’, as he three times writes, and is there 
a difference?). 
To me, things can have several different structural val-
ues. The mink coat can represent a final value and can, at 
the same time, be instrumentally valuable by keeping the 
owner warm. These values should not be combined in one 
“extrinsic final value”. Otherwise one loses the natural con-
trast between the notions of instrumental and final value. 
(One could of course turn to distinctions in kinds of extrin-
sicness.) 
4. Is Instrumental Value Often Intrinsic? 
While most philosophers regard instrumental value as a 
clear form of extrinsic value, Dale Dorsey (2012) has ar-
gued that instrumental value often is a form of intrinsic 
value. This implies, according to him, that “the Moorean 
view of the nature of final value is false: the identification of 
final value with intrinsic value fails to adequately distin-
guish between final value and instrumental value” (ibid., 
137). ( I note: Moore probably did not hold that all intrinsic 
values are final.) Dorsey opposes his view also to Røn-
now-Rasmussen’s mink-coat analysis (ibid., 147ff.). 
Dorsey presents his view in a couple of argumentative 
steps. He (ibid., 139f.) quotes Moore: “Whenever we judge 
that a thing is ‘good as a means,’ we are making a judg-
ment with regard to its causal relations: we judge both that 
it will have a particular kind of effect, and that that effect 
will be good in itself.” In this sense, Dorsey says, a “glass 
of wine is instrumentally valuable in the production of 
pleasure”. To me, this is a clear particular instrumental 
value. 
As wine also has other effects, e.g. hang-overs, Dorsey 
regards also this view of Moore’s as wanting, and suggests 
“that the instrumental value of a given object or event is 
determined by the value of its total consequences, includ-
ing what it causes, and what it prevents from occurring”. 
This idea, for him, is captured by Ben Bradley’s account of 
extrinsic value (ibid., 140ff.). This account entails that the 
instrumental value of a state of affairs equals the intrinsic 
value of its total consequences minus the intrinsic value of 
what it prevents. This notion of an overall instrumental 
value can cover both good and bad consequences and 
preventions, also concerning objects. E.g., the instrumen-
tal value of my favorite hammer would be determined by a 
comparison of the world in which this hammer exists with a 
world in which it does not.  
Yet, for Dorsey, this is not an adequate account of in-
strumental value, but an account of what he (infelici-
tously?) calls “being instrumental to value” (ibid., 142). I 
would call it an ‘account of overall actual instrumental 
value’, since he indicates that something is instrumental to 
value, “if its actual consequences are, on balance, good, 
i.e. if it is causally implicated in the actual production of 
final value.” (ibid.) Note that what he calls ‘actual’ here are 
the consequences. 
Enter examples like John Steinbeck’s oranges (ibid., 
143ff.). The oranges get dumped and burnt in order to 
keep prices up. Dorsey reserves the distinction ‘instrumen-
tal value’ for such cases. He sides here with C. I. Lewis 
(ibid., 146) who wrote: “A thing A will never be said to have 
extrinsic value or instrumental value, unless it is meant to 
imply that there is some other thing, B, to which it is or may 
be instrumental, which has intrinsic value” (his emphasis). 
And he states: “an object’s being instrumentally valuable 
can supervene on the potential, or disposition, it has to 
contribute to final value” (my emphasis). 
The “tragedy” of the destroyed oranges, for Dorsey is 
“that their actual instrumental value goes to waste” (ibid., 
145), and not just some potential instrumental value. Note, 
here ‘actual’ is not being applied to consequences. To me, 
the tragedy is equally drastically, but still more precisely, 
described when we say that something of great potential 
instrumental value has gone to waste. You may add: the 
oranges “actually” had this potential value.    
In this way, Dorsey arrives at his own view of “Instru-
mental value as power”. He writes (ibid., 146): 
Instrumental Value as Power: An object, state, or event 
Φ is instrumentally valuable if and only if it possesses 
the disposition to be instrumental to value. 
In this sense, Steinbeck’s oranges are instrumentally valu-
able, as they “are disposed, possess a power, the manifes-
tation of which is being instrumental to value, and the acti-
vation conditions of which include, say, being consumed 
by the hungry” (ibid., 146f.), in “ordinary conditions” (ibid., 
151) of a “world like ours” (ibid., 152). 
For Dorsey (ibid.), being eaten in ordinary conditions “is 
not a relation upon which the ascription of a disposition 
depends. ... this relation … when present, will help to pro-
duce the manifestation associated with that disposition. … 
when making dispositional property ascriptions, the con-
textually relevant background conditions are folded into the 
activation conditions of any given dispositional property 
ascription.” Therefore, the disposition of an orange “to be 
instrumental to value is an intrinsic property – it is a prop-
erty shared by any intrinsic twin”.  
Voila his main thesis (ibid.): “instrumental value, depend-
ing on the object or state, can be an example of intrinsic 
value”, as the instrumental value in question, according to 
him, supervenes on an intrinsic property, the disposition in 
question.  – He does not claim that all instrumental values 
are intrinsic: e.g., the instrumental value of money de-
pends on its having been governmentally minted or 
printed. 
To me, most disposition ascriptions have an ineliminable 
relational or contextual dimension and cannot solely refer 
to intrinsic properties. (Exceptions may be certain disposi-
tions of living beings, like the disposition to daydream.) 
Being nourishing to humans is a relational dimension of 
the respective disposition of oranges. If you try to “fold it 
away” into activation conditions, you are no longer describ-
ing and ascribing a disposition. Dorsey’s suggested intrin-
sic-twin argument simply is a non sequitur: Identical or “in-
trinsic” twins, by definition, share any of their dispositions, 
whether intrinsic or relational. 
(Taken literally, the view’s name ‘Instrumental value as 
power or disposition’ commits a category mistake. Disposi-
tions are factors in the dynamic networks of reality, values 
are not. However, Dorsey often says (e.g. ibid., 147), more

carefully, that instrumental values supervene on disposi-
tions.) 
5. Final Value: General or Particular, Actual 
or Potential 
Many philosophical discussions of final value are rather 
general, guided by the general interpretation of an object’s 
final value as its being valuable, not for the sake of some-
thing else, but for its own sake. Rabinowicz and Rønnow-
Rasmussen’s treatment of final value, e.g., explicitly uses 
this interpretation (cf. 1999, 33). Well-known candidates of 
general final values are happiness, pleasure, thriving, jus-
tice. Discussions about such values have been general in 
the sense that they do not refer to specifically instrumental 
contexts or means-ends relations. I.e., final values have 
often been discussed not specifically as correlates instru-
mental values. 
I myself have been exploring the idea that we also 
should have one or more specific notions of final value for 
specifically instrumental contexts, notions which can be 
considered strict correlates of notions of instrumental 
value. Such a search, one could say, is guided by the 
equally common idea that an object has final value if it is 
valuable as an end.  The detailed foregoing discussion of 
notions of instrumental value will facilitate such a search. 
We have met with the actual particular instrumental 
value of a glass of wine. The result of intentionally con-
suming it is a very particular kind of pleasure, a light and 
pleasant intoxication, which, correspondingly, can be said 
to represent an actual particular final value. 
I introduced the notion of overall actual instrumental 
value of something. This value concerns the production of 
actual, on balance good, consequences. Unless all conse-
quences are valuable in terms of one and the same value 
there is no simple corresponding notion of an overall ac-
tual final value. And if the consequences are valuable in 
very different ways, it is not evident whether their values 
could be summed up in one sort of total final value. 
We had the potential instrumental value of Steinbeck’s 
oranges. The correlate clearly is the potential final value of 
the pleasure, or at least the satisfaction, which they could 
have brought about. 
I am aware of the fact that in all these cases of values 
further finer and more complex distinctions could be made. 
6. Concluding Remark 
We have seen that there are intriguing issues in the field of 
formal axiology. It remains to be explored to what extent 
the notions and distinctions of structural types of value 
have a broader significance, e.g. in the critique of com-
mercialized science, in determining the value of virtues or 
in determining the instrumental badness of death.

(Moral) Philosophy Without Intuitions? You Wish! 
Friderik Klampfer 
Maribor, Slovenia | friderik.klampfer@gmail.com 
Abstract 
Herman Cappelen has recently argued (Cappelen 2012), against the predominant self-understanding of contemporary analytic 
philosophy, that its heavy reliance on intuitions as (sources of) evidence is a myth and a misconception. According to a diagnos-
tic tool that he himself developed, most of the putative appeals to intuitions serve a variety of linguistic and dialectical, but very 
few argumentative purposes. In short, there is a prevalence of ‘intuition’ talk and discourse, but not really a prevalence of the 
corresponding method of justification. In the paper, I take up Cappelen’s challenge. I find both his proposed diagnostic tool and 
his analyses of concrete cases wanting. Appeals to intuition are much more frequent and reliance on them far too regular to al-
low for methodological triumphalism. I support this claim by examples from the debate on moral responsibility, where appeals to 
intuition abound. What Cappelen calls Centrality, the view that intuitions are an important, if not indispensable, source of evi-
dence for and against philosophical theories, is very much alive among analytic philosophers. This, I argue in conclusion, rein-
states experimental philosophy as an important corrective to the reigning, often unreflective use of intuitions in moral inquiry. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
It is part of contemporary analytic philosophy's self-
conception that in doing philosophy we rely heavily on in-
tuitions (about real and hypothetical cases). Cappelen 
calls this thesis 'Centrality' and spends a bulk of his other-
wise excellent book trying to refute it. 
‘Centrality’ is advanced as a descriptive rather than nor-
mative or modal claim. It is meant to be a description of 
how (most) contemporary analytic philosophers go about 
(dis)proving philosophical claims and theories – namely by 
appeal to their own and other people's intuitions as evi-
dence or sources of evidence for and against philosophical 
theories. Cappelen sets out to prove that under no plausi-
ble construal of 'intuition', 'evidence', 'treating', and so on, 
is Centrality correct. 
This, if true, would not only amend the distorted view phi-
losophers have of their own practice, but possibly have 
wider methodological implications. It would, among others 
things, draw our attention away from questions that cur-
rently dominate debates in philosophical methodology, on 
nature, origin and epistemic status of intuitions, and help 
redirect our minds to more fruitful issues. However, it 
would also make most if not all experimental philosophy 
stuff irrelevant, insofar as it is premised on, and centred 
around, the truth of Centrality. 
Cappelen identifies two lines of argument in favour of 
Centrality. The first, which he calls the argument from intui-
tion-talk (AIT), takes frequent use of words such as 'intui-
tion', 'intuitively' and their many cognates at face value. 
And Cappelen does a nice job of showing how needless 
and careless such mentions often are and discerning 
many linguistic, yet very few argumentative, roles that such 
words play. The other, philosophically more interesting, 
argument he labels the Argument from Philosophical Prac-
tice (APP). It starts by identifying certain key features of 
intuitions (distinct phenomenology, unchallenged epistemic 
status and origin in conceptual competence) and then 
goes on to prove that, despite appearances to the con-
trary, once this diagnostic tool is applied to a selection of 
ten notorious cases from a range of philosophical disci-
plines, we often come across appeals to general knowl-
edge, common ground and other types of unargued prem-
ises in philosophical arguments, but no, or hardly any, ap-
peals to intuitions thus defined. 
Now, as one of those Cappelen labels the ‘concerned', I 
am sympathetic to his larger project. I find intuitions a poor 
and unreliable source of evidence and would like to see 
philosophy liberated from their methodological grip. Fur-
thermore, I find many of Cappelen's insights valuable and 
his analyses enlightening. That said, I didn’t find his diag-
nostic tool useful, wasn't truly convinced by his analyses of 
the ten paradigmatic cases and, consequently, failed to be 
converted into one of Centrality’s deniers in the end. 
Here is the plan of my paper. I will first present and criti-
cally discuss Cappelen’s diagnostic tool. Next, I will focus 
on his treatment of two of the ten selected cases, Thom-
son's Violinist and Thomson/Foot's Trolley (and Surgeon) 
case. I will then show that appeals to intuitions are much 
more frequent than Cappelen is willing to admit. And, fi-
nally, in the last section, I will briefly defend the relevance 
of experimental philosophy for philosophical methodology 
in particular and philosophical practice in general. But let 
me start with some necessary stage setting. 
2. Proposed diagnostics for appeals to in-
tuitions 
The following features are meant to help us identify ap-
peals to intuition:  
F1: distinct phenomenology (seemings: if I believe, or 
accept p intuitively, then it seems to me that p; I cannot 
help but see p as true, and so it strikes me as neces-
sarily so);   
F2: special epistemic status (two features count as evi-
dence that p is assigned special epistemic status char-
acteristic of intuition: (a) if p is treated as justified even 
though neither memory nor experience are adduced as 
evidence for its truth, nor is p inferred from other prem-
ises; or (b) if p is what Cappelen calls ‘evidence recalci-
trant’, i.e. such that even though S can come up with 
some arguments for p, S would still feel inclined to en-
dorse p even after these arguments are proven un-
sound); 
F3: conceptual basis (judgment that p counts as intui-
tive only if it is justified by the subject’s conceptual or 
linguistic competence alone). 
The proposed diagnostic tool raises several issues. Here 
are just a few:

161
(i) Why is speed and ease of judgment left out? It 
seems to arbitrarily restrict the range of possible 
candidates for intuition.  
(ii) What is the relevant unit of investigation: passages, 
whole papers, discussion threads? This is deliber-
ately left open, but the analyses themselves are 
more or less confined to shorter passages which in-
troduce, describe or modify some hypothetical case 
(or a range of cases). How these cases are treated 
by other authors at a later stage in the debate, criti-
cally or dogmatically, is never brought to bear on the 
issue.  
(iii) Of the three defining features of intuitions, F1-F3, 
F2, ‘Rock’ seems to be the most central. It is also the 
least obscure and controversial of the three. The 
other two, specific phenomenology and justification 
by conceptual competence alone, are riddled with 
problems. Take, for instance, phenomenology. There 
is no agreement about the details of the phenome-
nology distinctive of intuitions, apart from an un-
specified feeling of obviousness and, occasionally, 
necessitation. Nor is it clear at any point whose ex-
perience is decisive in contemplating the cases: the 
author’s, her peers’, the audience’s, or the reader’s? 
(iv) Even ‘Rock’, however, is too vague a criterion to be 
of much help. On p. 135, Cappelen describes the 
somewhat 'elusive' phenomenon that 'Rock' is trying 
to capture, as follows: »a proposition p is endorsed 
and treated as justified despite a complete absence 
of reasons and evidence given in support for it. It has 
some kind of default justificatory status.« Are we to 
understand this as stating a sufficient condition on 
intuition that is somewhat different from those, 
enumerated in F1-F3? For if so, then many moral 
arguments, including Thomson's treatment of the 
Violinist and the Trolley case, are going to turn out to 
be premised on intuition, since the truth of respective 
judgments of permissibility is initially assumed 
without proof and later never questioned (not even 
by other participants in the debate). As such, it has 
'some kind of default justificatory status'. That we 
can often relatively easily come up with reasons or 
arguments in support of these judgments, if pressed 
to do so, is largely irrelevant, since, as Haidt (2001) 
has convincingly shown, such moral reasoning 
comes afterwards and merely serves to rationalize 
our intuitive responses.  
(v) The role of conceptual competence in the justifica-
tion of intuitive judgments is no less problematic. 
Cappelen wants to retain the necessity & aprioricity 
element of rational intuition, i.e. the idea at the heart 
of his arch enemy, methodological rationalism that 
intuitions provide apriori justification of necessary 
truths. And so, accordingly, he treats the lack of con-
ceptual justification as evidence for the absence of 
intuition. However, since in response to hypothetical 
scenarios such as Trolley, Violinist, Surgeon, Smith 
and Jones, Jim and the Indians, we hardly ever en-
counter moral propositions that purport to be con-
ceptual truths, this arbitrary restriction threatens to 
rule out, by default, a large chunk of moral philoso-
phy. 
3. A non-representative selection of cases?  
Suppose the points I made are valid and both Violinist and 
Trolley receive unsatisfactory treatment in Cappelen's 
book.
1 What, if any, implications does this have for Cappe-
len's main thesis? Well, it may only force him to reconsider 
his initial choice of cases that were meant to illustrate the 
power of his diagnostic tool. But now suppose the oppo-
nent brings up a couple of cases in which authors do seem 
to make appeal to intuitions, i.e. where the defining fea-
tures of intuitions, F1-F3 are clearly present in argumenta-
tion (think, for example, of James Rachels’ Smith and 
Jones, or Peter Unger’s Envelope). Wouldn’t that under-
mine Cappelen’s thesis? Well, at a minimum, it would 
show that Cappelen’s selection of cases was not as repre-
sentative as he thought. But it may just as well vindicate 
‘Centrality’. 
Which brings us to another, more serious problem with 
Cappelen’s strategy (one that he himself acknowledges, to 
be fair to him). Since ‘Centrality’ is formulated in fairly ge-
neric terms (“This is how contemporary analytic philosophy 
is being done.” Or “This or that is typical of contemporary 
analytic philosophy.”), it remains unclear what kind of con-
trary evidence and how much of it would suffice for its refu-
tation (i.e. what observed prevalence of the reliance on C-
intuitions would count as vindication of Centrality?). 
Leaving this problem aside, can we find other examples 
of appeals to intuitions in moral philosophy that meet if not 
the stricter (F1-F3), then at least the less strict criterion? 
This shouldn’t be too difficult, as long as we keep in mind 
the following: just as the use of ‘intuition’ and its cognates 
doesn’t always signify that intuition is present, the absence 
of such vocabulary doesn’t always indicate the missing 
intuition. In one of the classical and most influential texts of 
contemporary analytic philosophy, Harry Frankfurt (1971) 
makes frequent appeals to what is ‘apparent to him’, his 
‘linguistic intuitions’, to what ‘seems to be the case’, and 
the like. The resulting industry of Frankfurt-style cases 
abounds by similar appeals. (Black & Tweedale 2002, 
Sommers) In fact, attempts to build a theory that fits our 
ordinary, i.e. intuitive judgments well, unites compatibilists 
and incompatibilists across the dividing line (van Inwagen 
1993).   
4. Bygone experimental philosophy? 
One of the more far-reaching and startling implications of 
Cappelen’s diagnostic test is that it seems to make most of 
the widely-discussed experimental philosophy’s findings 
redundant. If philosophers don’t rely extensively on their 
own (and their peers’) intuitions, then showing the latter 
not representative or in discord with most lay people’s in-
tuitions wouldn’t really be detrimental to the ordinary busi-
ness of philosophy. Cappelen is unrepentant in his verdict 
on EP – EP either attacks (in its negative version) or at-
tempts to support (in its positive version) a practice that 
                                                      
1 In “Trolley”, Thomson never uses the word ‘intuitively’ or ‘intuition’. Instead, 
she begins her inquiry with an unanimous agreement: “everybody to whom I 
have put this hypothetical example, says ‘yes, it is permissible to turn the trol-
ley’”, whereas “everybody to whom I have put this second hypothetical case 
(i.e. the Surgeon) says ‘no, it would not be morally permissible for you to pro-
ceed’”. We don’t know whether those judgments were formed quickly and 
without much deliberation or after careful reflection. And yet, the starting as-
sumption (that while killing one to save five is permissible in Trolley, this isn’t 
the case in Surgeon, and hence the two situations must differ in at least one 
morally relevant feature) can and ought to be challenged – for surely it is one 
thing to establish that while A-G judge X (under description KO2SF) permissi-
ble, H-N judge Y (under the same description, KO2SF) impermissible, and 
something completely different to take, as a moral datum, or a given, or an 
observed phenomenon calling for urgent explanation, that X is permissible and 
Y is impermissible, even though both actions are tokens of the same action-
type, namely KO2SF.

doesn’t exist: “If philosophers don’t rely on intuitions, then 
the project of checking people’s intuition is philosophically 
pointless.” (Cappelen 2012; 222) 
But isn’t such dismissal premature? After all, what is the 
important message that experimental philosophers are 
trying to convey to their more traditionally-minded peers? I 
can think of at least two: first, intuitions generated in re-
sponse to philosophical thought-experiments are much 
more diverse and heterogenous than the ones profes-
sional philosophers appeal to when looking for  support of 
their own philosophical views; and second, people’s intui-
tions seem to be sensitive to a variety of features of little or 
no philosophical relevance, including socio-economic and 
cultural background of a person considering the thought-
experiment, level of abstractness, order and manner of 
presentation, and so on (see Knobe & Doris 2010), which 
undermines their status as evidence. 
Cappelen would probably agree with this and much more 
– intuitions, even C-intuitions, make for a pretty lousy start-
ing point of philosophical inquiry. However, since accord-
ing to his analyses they are rarely, if ever, assigned such 
epistemic role, he doesn’t find this fact alarming. But we 
should. Research painfully reminds us of just how fragile, 
contingent, varied and context-dependent our intuitions 
about moral responsibility are. (Nelkin 2007, Sommers) 
5. Conclusion 
I have argued, contrary to Cappelen, that ‘Centrality’, or at 
least its qualified version, ‘CentralityMP’, is true, i.e. that 
appeals to intuition as (source of) evidence are frequent in 
(moral) philosophy and hence that this justifies our preoc-
cupation with various aspects of intuitive moral judgment 
within philosophical methodology and re-establishes the 
relevance of experimental philosophy’s findings for the lat-
ter. If we can’t get rid of intuitions with a sweep of diagnos-
tic wand, we better start developing some viable alterna-
tives to intuition-based philosophizing. (Weinberg 2007)

Modelling the Senses, Modelling the World: Wittgenstein, Pictures, 
Ethical Implications of Multiplicity of Sensorial Experience 
Stephanie Koerner 
Manchester, UK | Stephanie.Koerner@manchester.ac.uk 
Abstract 
This paper uses the idea of ‘modelling the senses, modelling the world’ (Crombie 1994) to compare Wittgenstein’s ‘picture the-
ory of meaning’ with novel recent approaches to images and ‘visual culture’ as foci for rethinking art and science’s histories. The 
concluding section concerns contributions such comparisons can make to addressing problems that “Western privileging of 
sight as the aesthetic sense” (Classen 1998: 139) poses for addressing such jointly epistemic and ethical questions as: What 
should be represented? Why? By and for Whom? How? (e.g., IWS 2006) 
 
 
Contextualising Polemical Interpretations 
of Wittgenstein, and of Art and Science 
Until rather recently, few scholars might have seen Witt-
genstein’s concepts of ‘a picture,’ ‘language games’ and 
‘forms of life as useful for rethinking ‘standard’ accounts of 
art, science and modernity.   Close associations between 
polemical interpretations of Wittgenstein and of art and 
science figured centrally amongst barriers (e.g. IWS 2010). 
Gaps widened in the latter half of the 20
th century between 
influentially opposed positions on such wide ranging is-
sues as: whether modernity should be interpreted as a tri-
umph or as a tragedy; whether the humanities and social 
sciences should be modelled on ‘hard’ sciences; and 
whether art and science are mutually untranslatable prac-
tices? Lorraine Daston (2006: 523) and others have noted 
how long the “history of science has been enlisted to show 
the unity and distinctiveness of Europe….  Whether under-
stood as a triumph or tragedy… the Scientific Revolution 
has been portrayed as Europe’s decisive break with tradi-
tion – the first such break in world history and the model 
for all subsequent epics of modernization in other culture.” 
By “the mid-20
th century, the history of science was para-
doxically the most and the least historicised of all branches 
of history. The most, because [it] seemed to be the fastest 
[and the] propulsion behind all other parts of history…. The 
least because [it] was written as if context and contin-
gency… were irrelevant” (Ibid: 529).  
Utopic and dystopic images of art, science and moder-
nity are interdependent:  “Science, the anatomist of the 
1860s insisted, began when artistic license was cancelled. 
Art, Baudelaire maintained, began when the deadening 
industrial mechanical ethos of science could be forcibly set 
aside” (Jones and Galison 1998: 2). Such dichotomies 
generate others, including: hard – soft, intuitive - analytical, 
inductive - deductive, random - systematic, individual – col-
lective, primitive – modern, male – female, sensorial – logical, 
and so on; perpetuating ‘two cultures’ polemic and notions 
that see the task of science as that of revealing supposedly 
timeless truths; and art as an esoteric expression of either 
‘mere’ subjective experience or artistic ‘genius’ (Jones and 
Galison 1998: 21).  The roles these dyads play in polemical 
caricatures of analytic and continental philosophical traditions 
is equally difficult to overstate (Friedman 2000). They have 
played likewise central roles in such polemic as that over 
relativistic interpretations Wittgenstein’s emphasis on lan-
guage games and forms of life being contingent on use, 
culture and context versus interpretations of his idea that 
“form of life” is a “shared human behaviour” as a “univer-
salistic turn” (Biletzki and Matar 2006). What bears stress-
ing here is that, in such views, contextual and comparative 
approaches to art and science as ‘language games,’ 
‘forms of life’ or ‘cultural systems’ are incompatible – even 
impossible.  
‘Modelling the Senses, Modelling the World’  
Fortunately, these have not been the only views. In tan-
dem with efforts to rethink art and science’s histories, there 
have been remarkable innovations in rethinking polemic 
over Wittgenstein; in materials eclipsed, and in considering 
relevance for pressing epistemic and social problems – as 
evidenced by IWS conferences. The present essay is in-
spired by innovations, which facilitate using the idea of 
‘modelling the senses, modelling the world’ as a window 
into parallels and contrasts between Wittgenstein’s con-
cepts of a ‘picture’ and novel approaches to using images 
and visual culture as a focus of contextual and compara-
tive studies of art and science as ‘cultural systems’. Paral-
lels are not coincidental.  Few scholars have made more 
influential contributions to the roles insights drawn from 
Wittgenstein have played in the history of the latter than 
the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz (1973, 1976, 1983), and 
the art historian, Michael Baxandall (1972, 1985). Wittgen-
stein’s work  inform Geertz ’s ‘thick description’ approach 
to interpreting cultures;  arguments concerning the light 
that studying  ‘experience far’  cultures can throw on prob-
lems with the ‘taken for granted’ ‘experience near’; and 
contextual studies of the normative dimensions of cultural 
practices.  In his extremely influential book, The Period 
Eye: Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century (1972), 
Baxandall stressed the importance for rethinking this iconic 
period of exploring the historically contingent values and 
forms of life that motivated its cultural innovations.  
The expression, ‘modelling the senses, modelling the 
world’ comes from Alastair Crombie (1994). For Crombie 
(as for the authors of the publications listed below) the im-
portance of rethinking art and science is not restricted to 
studying materials that ‘standard’ narratives eclipse: ques-
tions come forward about the circumstances under which 
problematical generalisations become taken for granted; 
and about history’s philosophical significance (Jones and 
Galison 1998; Koerner 2013). Hieronymus Bosch’s (1450 
– 1516) drawing, “The Forests have Ears and the Fields 
have Eyes,” illustrates the idea. Han Belting (2002: 68) 
notes that the title is a metaphor for the artist’s home town 
(‘s-Hertogenbosch literally means “the forest [Bos] of the 
duke [Herzog]); and the image pictures the “philosophy 
and survival strategy” that it is better to see (eyes = Ogen) 
and hear (be silent) under conditions of epistemic and so-
cial conflict: “Suddenly, the dead tree in which the owl and

the fox seek shelter takes on new meanings. While the 
birds in the branches screech loudly and flap their wings, 
drawing attention and thus danger to themselves, the owl 
and the fox hide silently within.”     
Belting’s interpretation raises as many questions as it 
answers -  including questions raised by Wittgenstein’s 
(1922: 2.22) idea that thoughts and propositions should be 
seen as ‘pictures’ and that “the picture is a model of real-
ity,” such as:   
 How and why does an object or phenomenon be-
come the focus of artistic representations? Scientific 
inquiry? Crises over representation?  
 Why do some motifs or objects remain provocative, 
while others fade from notice?  
 Why have some objects or ideas reoccurred - but un-
der very different cultural conditions, in different me-
dia, and with different meanings and functions?  
The idea, ‘modelling the senses, modelling the world,’ is 
useful for comparing Wittgenstein’s  concepts of ‘pictures’ 
with foci on images or ‘visual culture’ in:  
 Styles of Scientific Thinking in the European Tradition 
(Crombie 1994);  
 Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy 
and Patterns of Intention: On the Historical Explana-
tion of Pictures (Baxandall 1972, 1985)  
 The Art of Describing. Dutch art in the Seventeenth 
Century (Alpers 1983);  
 The Lure of Antiquity and the Cult of the Machine. 
The Kunstkammer and the evolution of nature, art 
and technology (Bredekamp 1995).  
 Picturing Science, Producing Art (Jones and Galison 
1998),  
 Sensorium. Embodied experience, technology and 
contemporary art (Jones 2006).  
 Objectivity (Daston and Galison 2007),  
There is much diversity amongst these works. However, 
they share features that compare with Wittgenstein’s in 
remarkable ways. Amongst commonalities, three bear 
stressing. Especially evident are comparably critical per-
spectives on the normative roles of seemingly ‘self-evident’ 
categories and generalisations. Second is a shared inter-
est in ‘pictures’ as models. In Wittgenstein, a “picture con-
sists of its elements,” and “in the fact that its elements are 
combined with one another in a definite way” (1984: 2.13 – 
2.14). Bilietzki and Matar (2014) note that, for Wittgenstein: 
“The logical structure of the picture, whether in thought or 
in language, is isomorphic with the logical structure of the 
state of affairs which it pictures. More subtle is Wittgen-
stein's insight that the possibility of this structure being 
shared by the picture (the thought, the proposition) and the 
state of affairs is the pictorial form. “That is how a picture is 
attached to reality; it reaches right out to it [TLP 2.1511].” 
This compares with the attention the works above devote 
to replacing generalisations about ‘hidden meanings’ with 
studies of the “work” images do and the conditions that 
enable them “to count as culture” (Jones and Galison 
1998: 21).  Relating to this, the works above share Witt-
genstein’s emphasis on the “normative character” of all 
forms of human expression and intentionality; “insistence 
on the normative character of language and intentionality”; 
and commitment to understanding norms as “practices” 
(Brandom 1994: 55). This motivates their approaches to 
the cosmological roles of metaphorical models the senses 
and the world. There is nothing ‘mere’ about these roles. 
‘Vision’ can and has been a powerful symbolic form, facili-
tating diverse meaning transfers, including: metaphor - from 
one thing to something similar; metonymy - cause and effect; 
synecdoche - from whole to parts; irony - from one thing to its 
opposite (as in Bosch’s drawing).  
All this does not eclipse contrasts. The most evident is 
between Wittgenstein’s highly a-historical orientations 
(Toulmin 2001), and the above works focus on the phi-
losophical significance of contextual and comparative his-
tory. A corollary is the latter’s comparative approaches to 
possibly analogous embodied, materially embedded con-
crete situations. Another contrast is treatment of conflict. 
Hacker (IWS 2006) and others stress that Wittgenstein 
seems to have systematically avoided relating his work to 
contemporary social problems. By contrast, the above listed 
works focus much attention on contextual connections be-
tween the histories of innovations in art, science, philosophy 
and deep and far reaching epistemic and social conflicts (or 
‘crises of representation’).  
 
Prospects for Alternatives to Privileging 
‘Vision’ - Ethical Implications of Appreci-
ating Multiplicity of Sensorial Experience 
Of course, human intelligence is embodied and embed-
ded…. The question is how important this fact is to the 
nature of intelligence” (Haugeland 1998: 211).  
A detailed examination of these patterns lies beyond the 
present essay’s scope. Instead, this concluding section 
uses our considerations as departure points for offering 
suggestions about fresh approaches to problems that 
“Western privileging of sight as the aesthetic sense” (Clas-
sen 1998: 139) pose for addressing questions of: What 
should be represented? Why? By and for whom? How? 
These questions draw attention to connections between 
such wide ranging issues as: history’s philosophical signifi-
cance; the embodied and materially embedded nature of 
culture, meanings, teaching and learning practices; and 
the dynamics of epistemic and social conflict.  Such con-
nections are brought into relief by the ways in which Pictur-
ing Science, Producing Art (1998) uses five ‘sites’ and 
questions to group chapters into sections: “Styles - How 
are images and practices aggregated, and to whose bene-
fit? Body - How do images shape body knowledge? See-
ing Wonders - What do we know when we see? Objectiv-
ity/Subjectivity - What do images presuppose about the 
world? Cultures of Vision: What do these presuppose 
about viewers?” (Jones and Galison 1998: 7-8). There is 
huge diversity amongst the topics the volume covers. 
However they also share remarkable features with one 
another, Bosch’s Forest and Field, and several Wittgen-
stein ‘pictures’, including that they:     
 are composed of culturally salient forces, structures, 
substance;    
 have diverse connotations;  
 arise on boundaries between culturally objectified 
fundamental differences;   
 can inspire fear and/or desire  depending on contexts;  
 can act as harbingers of dangers or agencies of good 
tidings;

165
 are symbolic forms in the sense that they facilitate 
meaning transfers;   
 can act as agencies of ‘translation’, for instance, in 
the senses that ancient Greeks used the term to a 
wide range of agencies and practices that made oth-
erwise invisible things, visible;  
 operate on thresholds of becoming - or of the actual 
and the possible.  
It bears stressing that not only metaphorical models of the 
senses and the world, but also of ‘vision’ and lack of sight 
(or ‘blindness’) share such features and normative conno-
tations.  While numerous questions arise in these lights, to 
conclude we focus on prospects for addressing that prob-
lems posed by privileging ‘vision’ and ‘sight’ for addressing 
the questions about ‘representation’ above. Constance 
Classen’s work in these areas is indispensable. Classen 
(1998: 1) stresses that, at least since the Enlightenment 
prioritising vision has been closely associated with “thinking 
of perception as a physical rather than a cultural act.” She 
also stresses the huge scope of alternatives, including: the 
plethora of cultural interpretations of senses as communi-
cation media rather than passive recipients of data that do 
not prioritise vision; and the cultural orientations and mod-
els of people who lack particular senses.  Indeed, for Clas-
sen, few insights gained from challenging traditional mind 
– body dichotomies are more important than those about 
the impacts that Western privileging of sight has had on 
characterisations of “persons who lack sight” as lacking in 
capacities for learning, and even in aesthetic and ethical 
experiences.   
Classen’s The Colour of Angels: Cosmology, Gender, 
and Aesthetic Imagination (1998) is intended not only to 
challenge such characterisations, but also to illustrate the 
importance of appreciating the multiplicity of sensorial ex-
perience for fresh approaches to the above mentioned 
questions, using examples of great philosophical and ethi-
cal significance. Classen (1998: 8) explains that, while 
“standard philosophies and psychologies of aesthetics cus-
tomarily held that the appreciation of aesthetics relies so 
heavily upon visual perception that the blind can have no 
real notion of beauty,”  key arguments in the book include: 
that ”modern understanding of aesthetics relies so heavily 
on the visual that the sighted are hampered in their appre-
ciation of beauty experience through other senses,”  and 
that to ”begin to appreciate the subtleties of a sense-
scape, to feel the power of a music of vibrations, or to ex-
perience tactile worlds of art, the sighted majority must turn 
for instruction to the aesthetic realms of the blind and the 
blind-deaf.” 
An exploration of these insights importance for rethinking 
art and science’s histories – and key IWS 2014 themes – 
must occur elsewhere.  However comparing such aesthetic 
realms with Wittgenstein’s ‘pictures’ and the realms Pro-
fessor Michael Tomasello’s explored in his 2013 IWS Ple-
nary Lecture (“Communication before Language”) might 
provide useful points of departure.

Philosophy and the Theories of Mind 
Zsuzsanna Kondor 
Budapest, Hungary | kondorzs@gmail.com 
Abstract 
Resolving or overcoming the difficulties raised by the mind-body split appears to be a nearly insoluble challenge for philoso-
phers. In this paper I will attempt to illuminate the difficulties which are rooted in either a secondary transcendence as a solution 
to mind-body dualism, or in monism, which establishes its theory on the physical body. In my argumentation I will rely on phe-
nomenology on the one hand, and recent radicalism with regard to enactive and/or embodied cognition on the other hand. I will 
argue that "the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language” (Wittgenstein 1963:109) is clearly visible from the per-
spective of phenomenology as Merleau-Ponty construed it, and that ideas apparently in opposition with the legacy of phenome-
nology sometimes converge surprisingly. 
 
 
1 From Substances to Dynamic Relations 
Although the dualism of the mind and the body as intro-
duced by Descartes suggests a substance dualism the 
relation between the mind and the body was rather am-
biguous even in Descartes' case. As Merleau-Ponty points 
out, "Descartes once said profoundly, the soul is not 
merely in the body like a pilot in his ship; it is wholly inter-
mingled with the body." (Merleau-Ponty 1964:5) Many 
suggestions were offered towards eliminating the obsta-
cles of the relation between mind and body. One branch of 
effort suggests considering the mental and the physical 
within a unified frame of reference under the headings of, 
for example, Being (Heidegger),  pure experience (James) 
or consciousness (Merleau-Ponty); another suggests 
choosing one of the two parties and constructing a coher-
ent framework within which both of the traditionally distin-
guished mental and physical phenomena are explicable. 
I believe that the former solution integrates the mental 
and physical, thanks to a reference point which bears at 
least a secondary transcendence1. In what follows, I will 
focus on James' and Merleau-Ponty's suggestions since 
the idea of embodied and enacted cognition emerges quite 
explicitly in these theories. 
As James wrote in 1904, "[m]y thesis is that if we start 
with the supposition that there is only one primal stuff or 
material in the world, a stuff of which everything is com-
posed, and if we call that stuff  'pure experience', then 
knowing can easily be explained as a particular sort of re-
lation towards one another into which portions of pure ex-
perience may enter. The relation itself is a part of pure ex-
perience; one of its 'terms' becomes the subject or bearer 
of the knowledge, the knower, the other becomes the ob-
ject known." (1987:1142)  
Pure experience provides a framework within which the 
accustomed 
pairs 
of 
dualisms 
are 
resolved. 
"As 
'subjective' we say that the experience represents; as 
'objective' it is represented. What represents and what is 
represented is here numerically the same; but we must 
remember that no dualism of being represented and rep-
resenting resides in the experience per se. In its pure 
state, or when isolated, there is no self-splitting of it into 
consciousness and what the consciousness is 'of.' " 
(James 1987:1151) 
                                                      
1 This transcendence is secondary because it is world-immanent, therefore it 
has no divine character, but it is beyond the two kinds of substances or prop-
erties. For more detail, see Munkácsy 1980:164–169. 
In this context, consciousness meant a kind of relation 
"and does not denote a special stuff or way of being. The 
peculiarity of our experiences, that they not only are, but 
are known, which their 'conscious' quality is invoked to ex-
plain, is better explained by their relations - these relations 
themselves being experiences - to one another." (James 
1987:1152) 
Similarly to James’ notion of pure experience, Merleau-
Ponty suggests that consciousness is basically a frame of 
reference within which the perceiving body, its physical 
and cultural environment, and the subject (self) insepara-
bly belong together. Though in the reconstruction of the 
evolution of Husserlian phenomenology Merleau-Ponty 
notes that considering consciousness as being "the theater 
of all being and of the transcendental positing of any ob-
ject" is too Platonic (Merleau-Ponty 1964:55), his consid-
erations regarding consciousness seem to be rather close 
to this comprehension. In The Structure and Behaviour, he 
wrote that "what we call nature is already consciousness of 
nature, what we call life is already consciousness of life 
and what we call mental is still an object vis-a-vis con-
sciousness." (Merleau-Ponty 1963:184) Merleau-Ponty 
believes that it is important to keep in mind that conscious-
ness is not exclusively representational, rather it has more 
general forms which can be defined "by reference to an 
object", and in this case goals and their means or actions 
are inseparable. (Merleau-Ponty 1963:173f.) Moreover, 
when considering a football match for example, "the player 
becomes one with it [the field] and feels the direction of the 
'goal' ...  just as immediately as the vertical and the hori-
zontal planes of his own body. It would not be sufficient to 
say that consciousness inhabits this milieu. At this moment 
consciousness is nothing other than the dialectic of milieu 
and action." (Merleau-Ponty 1963:168f.) 
Consciousness provides the ground for a meaningful 
unity where, in case of normal functioning, the ambient 
world and the acting subject, and the mental and the so-
matic, are inseparable."Since the relations of the physical 
system and the forces which act upon it and those of the 
living being and its milieu are not the external and blind 
relations of juxtaposed realities, but dialectical relations in 
which the effect of each partial action is determined by its 
signification for the whole, the human order of conscious-
ness does not appear as a third order superimposed on 
the two others, but as their condition of possibility and their 
foundation."  (Merleau-Ponty 1963:202) Merleau-Ponty 
refers to the biologist Jakob Johann von Uexküll, who sug-
gested a metaphor, viz.  that "[e]very organism ... is a mel-
ody which sings itself". And this, "is not to say that it knows 
this melody and attempts to realize it; it is only to say that it

is a whole which is significant for a consciousness which 
knows it, not a thing which rests in-itself (en soi)." (Mer-
leau-Ponty 1963:159) 
Merleau-Ponty himself considered his suggestion not as 
being the elimination of the dualism of the soul and body, 
but rather its transformation into the distinction of "the lived 
and the known". That is, it is "the problem of the relations 
of consciousness as flux of individual events, of concrete 
and resistant structures, and that of consciousness as tis-
sue of ideal significations." (Merleau-Ponty 1963:215) But, 
consciousness as tissue of ideal significations can be man-
ifested either in bodily activity or in linguistic form, i.e., in 
propositional structures. And this fact has far reaching ef-
fects with regard to philosophical practice. I will return to 
this question in the conclusion. 
2 Phenomenal vs. Physical 
Different theories of mind, such as the embedded, embod-
ied, extended, enacted, amalgamated, enculturated, and 
the radicalized versions of some of the previous ones em-
phasize the complex character of cognition as it relates to 
its bodily and environmental context. In accordance with 
the evolution of the concept, increasingly refined argu-
ments were born with regard to some controversial issues, 
such as the hard problem of consciousness, the 
(in)defensibility of representationalism and  intellectualism, 
and the relation to physicalism - just to mention a few. 
In what follows, I will focus on radical embodied cognitive 
science as Anthony Chemero construed it, and radical en-
activism as Daniel D. Hutto and Eric Myin defined it. Both 
theories suggest a radical turn regarding embodied and 
enacted cognition, but their criticism seems to diverge. 
As we can see, the idea of embodied and enacted cogni-
tion had explicitly emerged at the latest with Merleau-
Ponty. He had formulated concepts of the inseparability of 
the body and its environment, the idea of restricting the 
role of mental representation, and considering perception 
as being an active bodily engagement.2 I think these as-
pects of cognition have gained a great deal of credibility. 
As Chemero and Silberstein put it, "we have a three-part, 
coupled, non-linear dynamical system in which the nervous 
system partly determines and is partly determined by the 
sensorimotor abilities which partly determine, and are 
partly determined by the affordances available to the ani-
mal." (Chemero, Silberstein 2012) Like Merleau-Ponty, 
Chemero underscores that "the phenomenological world of 
experience is neither in the head nor in the external world - 
it is fundamentally relational." (Chemero, Silberstein 2012) 
The core idea of radical embodied cognitive science is the 
avoidance of mental representations. (Chemero 2009:29) 
This is possible since any kind of activity is comprehensi-
ble only in a dynamic relational structure where each part 
(the nervous system, the sensorimotor system, and the 
environment) plays an active role and is in a reciprocal 
relation to each other part. If one of the three parts is con-
sidered as being separate and fixed, its functioning is un-
foreseeable as it is strongly underdetermined. 
Hutto and Myin chose a different route of argumentation, 
and were driven to a counterintuitive conclusion, viz. " 
there can be intentionally directed cognition and, even, 
perceptual experience without content." (Hutto, Myin 
2013:x) Through an elaborate conceptual analysis, they 
give a list of advantages we can enjoy if we accept their 
basic suggestion. The authors seem to take up a line quite 
                                                      
2 See especially Merleau-Ponty 2008:235ff., 1963:190. 
close to that of Type B materialism, which accepts an epis-
temic and explanatory gap but refuses the ontological one 
regarding the Hard Problem of Consciousness, and sug-
gests that the "phenomenal might just be physical de-
scribed differently - under a different guise or mode of 
presentation." (Hutto, Myin 2013:169f.) But there is a con-
siderable difference between Radical Enactive (or Embod-
ied) Cognition (REC)  and Type B materialism, namely that 
the former "cannot accept the existence of special phe-
nomenal concepts", rather they hold "that anything that 
might answer to the name 'phenomenal concept' will be a 
public concept". (Hutto, Myin 2013:173) 
If we accept that there is no difference among public 
concepts, i.e., we consider all of them as being the same 
and try to hold that basic mind is without content, we can 
confront the situation where science applies content to 
conscious phenomena and is capable of distinguishing 
different kinds of it. As Bernard Baars and his co-authors 
put it: "Consciousness presents an extraordinary range of 
contents - perception in the different senses, imagery, 
emotional feelings, concepts, inner speech, and action-
related ideas. … the content of a visual experience is very 
different from the taste of a lemon, or the sound of a bell. 
These differences may be related to the fact that, although 
a large proportion of the mammalian cortex is rather uni-
form in its histology (it is sometimes called isocortex), input 
to different cortical areas varies greatly. For example, vis-
ual input is very different in its statistical description from 
proprioceptive 
input, 
or 
olfactory 
input.” 
(Baars 
et.al.2005:124) 
3 The Burden of Making Things Explicit 
In conclusion, I will focus on the difficulty that emerges out 
of the strange situation where certain phenomena that we 
refer to with certain abstract concepts are not accessible 
without their manifestation3.  As neuroscientists suggest, 
thanks to brain imaging and statistical means, visual and 
proprioceptive contents are distinguishable. Of course, the 
linguistic descriptions of a smell or of scenery are different, 
just as the neuronal and muscular activity of the body is 
different if we lose our stability or we perceive an obstacle 
on our way. However, in a live situation, when I lose my 
stability because I noticed an obstacle the abovemen-
tioned distinction is hardly noticeable and the dynamical 
relational structure does not suggest separating them.  
The proposal of REC that there is no need for a duplica-
tion of the same phenomena as content is rather close to 
some antirepresenationalist accounts, similar to James' 
concern with regard to the unnoticed duplications of the 
originally identical, and can be defended if the so-called 
content is only the translation, a kind of scientific process-
ing of certain physical and/or neural activity. Here we can 
recall Sartre, who clearly deduced that consciousness 
cannot have a content: "All consciousness, as Husserl has 
shown, is consciousness of something. This means that 
there is no consciousness that is not positing of a tran-
scendent object, or if you prefer, that consciousness has 
no 'content'." (quoted by Rowlands 2010:178) And we can 
refer to Merleau-Ponty's proposal that my "perception does 
not bear upon a content of consciousness: it bears upon 
the ash-tray itself." (Merleau-Ponty 2008:303) That is, ei-
ther from the perspective of secondary transcendence; or 
a dynamical relational pattern of life, soul, and body; or 
REC; conscious content can be challenged whilst the

phrase is an active element of research. By all means, 
controversies which call into question accustomed ar-
rangement 
of 
theoretical 
concepts 
(such 
as 
mind/consciousness entailing content) may facilitate scien-
tific research since new perspectives may offer other con-
cepts which would result in more success. 
Merleau-Ponty summarised this problem as a tension 
between the organic unity of the mind, body, and its envi-
ronment, and the demand of scientific analysis. Finally, to 
quote him at length: "to the extent that the scientific knowl-
edge of the organism becomes more precise, it becomes 
impossible to give a coherent meaning to the alleged ac-
tion of the world on the body and of the body on the soul. 
The body and the soul are significations and have mean-
ing, then, only with regard to a consciousness.  
From our point of view also, the realistic thesis of com-
mon sense disappears at the level of reflexive thought, 
which encounters only significations in front of it. The ex-
perience of passivity is not explained by an actual passiv-
ity. But it should have a meaning and be able to be under-
stood. As philosophy, realism is an error because it trans-
poses into dogmatic thesis an experience which it deforms 
or renders impossible by that very fact. But it is a moti-
vated error; it rests on an authentic phenomenon which 
philosophy has the function of making explicit." (Merleau-
Ponty 1963:216)

Describing the Immanent Hidden and the Worldliness of the World: 
A Convergence in Later Wittgenstein’s and Early Heidegger’s 
Conceptions of the Aim and Method of Philosophy? 
Jo-Jo Koo 
Raleigh, NC, USA | jjkoo1999@gmail.com 
Abstract 
It has been rarely noted that the later Wittgenstein actually works with two understandings of the hidden (Verborgenheit) in 
Philosophical Investigations (PI). Although he continually and sharply criticizes our craving in PI for the “transcendent” hidden, 
he shows in PI §129 a deep respect for the “immanent” hidden. I first explore in this paper the connection between the reasons 
for this respect for the “immanent” hidden and the nature of “surveyable presentations” (übersichtliche Darstellungen) in PI 
§122. I then briefly sketch how later Wittgenstein’s conception of the immanent hidden converges with early Heidegger’s 
conception of the “worldliness of the world” (Weltlichkeit der Welt) in Sein und Zeit. I end the paper with some suggestive 
remarks about how this apparent convergence opens up a new aim and method for a correspondingly transformed way of doing 
philosophy to pursue as a fruitful possibility. 
 
 
It has been rarely noted that the later Wittgenstein actually 
works with two understandings of the hidden (Verborgen-
heit) in his later philosophy, not just the one that he criti-
cizes continually in Philosophical Investigations (hence-
forth PI).
1 The first understanding of the hidden is that of 
the transcendent hidden, which stands in various guises 
as one of Wittgenstein’s main targets in PI (e.g., PI §§91-2, 
102, 111, 153). According to this understanding of the hid-
den, what we must do in order to understand, say, the es-
sence of language, is to look behind or beneath the lin-
guistic phenomena that hide this essence (PI §§90, 92, 
97), so that we can articulate a philosophical theory that 
definitively explains this essence. Such a theory pro-
pounds and justifies philosophical theses that claim to ar-
ticulate the deep structure of language once and for all and 
explains on that basis how this structure underpins ordi-
nary uses of language. It exemplifies a Platonic attitude 
toward the phenomena that it seeks to analyze: It dispar-
ages their contingent, contextual, and messy character, 
and aims to articulate transcendent (“crystalline”) doctrines 
that are timeless and universally applicable to the kind of 
phenomena they are meant to explain. 
It is well known that the later Wittgenstein is deeply hos-
tile to this Platonic or intellectualistic way of doing philoso-
phy. In opposition, his own way of philosophizing does not 
seek to solve philosophical problems by providing a better 
theory, but to clarify the “grammar” of certain basic con-
cepts that we cannot help but apply by illuminating the 
multifaceted roles that these concepts play in human life 
(e.g., PI §§90, 109, 182). By removing misunderstandings 
(i.e., tempting but mistaken assumptions) that often lead 
us to believe that we have to solve certain unavoidable 
philosophical problems associated with the uses of these 
concepts, “grammatical” investigations do not so much 
solve these problems as dissolve them (PI §§90, 93, 118). 
On this view, the idea of the transcendent hidden is a 
tempting illusion of which we can rid ourselves by means 
of such investigations (PI §§97, 110). What we are left with 
is a position that is sometimes characterized as “quietism”, 
which aims to do away with all philosophical explanations 
                                                      
1 All references in this paper are to Hacker and Schulte’s revised fourth edition 
of PI (Wittgenstein 2009). Michael Luntley is one of the few interpreters of 
Wittgenstein who has also noted that there are two understandings of the 
hidden in later Wittgenstein’s philosophy (Luntley 2003: 50-7). I am indebted to 
Luntley for the expressions ‘transcendent hidden’ and ‘immanent hidden’ that I 
appropriate and use in this paper (2003: 50-3). 
and renounces the obligation of doing constructive phi-
losophy (PI §§109-33): 
Philosophy just puts everything before us, and neither 
explains nor deduces anything. – Since everything lies 
open to view, there is nothing to explain. For whatever 
may be hidden [verborgen] is of no interest to us. (PI 
§126)             
On this understanding of what it is to conduct grammatical 
investigations, there is not much left over for philosophy to 
do after “bring[ing] words back from their metaphysical to 
their everyday use” (PI §116), once we have ridden our-
selves of the impulse to try to capture the transcendent 
hidden by explaining it supposedly definitively by means of 
some philosophical theory.   
But there is another understanding of the hidden at work 
in PI to which Wittgenstein is not hostile:   
The aspects of things that are most important for us are 
hidden [verborgen] because of their simplicity and 
everydayness [Alltäglichkeit]. (One is unable to notice 
something – because it is always before one’s eyes.) 
The actual foundations of their inquiry do not strike 
people at all. Unless that fact has at some time struck 
them. – And this means: we fail to be struck by what, 
once seen, is most striking and most powerful. (PI 
§129, emphasis in the original, translation slightly modi-
fied)2 
Several ideas stand out in this thought-provoking passage.  
The first is that there are aspects of things that are hid-
den, not by being an essence that lies behind or beneath 
the phenomena we investigate, but precisely by being or-
dinary and familiar (alltäglich). In other words, it is their 
utter transparency that makes them paradoxically hidden. 
Second, Wittgenstein claims that these particular aspects 
of things are most striking and most powerful. In contrast 
to his strongly critical attitude about our craving for the 
transcendent hidden, this remark about the second kind of 
hiddenness shows great respect for it. Although there is no 
space here to support the following interpretive claim, it 
seems fairly clear that what is most striking and most pow-
erful about what we can call the immanent hidden is the 
                                                      
2 This second understanding of the hidden shows up already in PI §92, where 
he is focused primarily on criticizing the idea of the transcendent hidden.

hard-won recognition that the living of ordinary human life 
itself suffices to provide the “groundless grounds”
3 on 
which such living can not only be norm-governed (PI §§85-
8, 154-5, 198-242), but also undermine some common 
philosophical misunderstandings about how various fea-
tures of such living (or, more generally, of being human) is 
possible.  
Another striking idea from PI §129 can be best brought 
out when it is considered in conjunction with PI §122.
4 It 
further elaborates the nature of the aspects of things that 
are most striking and most powerful. Although Wittgenstein 
does not discuss these aspects very much, he does sug-
gest that they pertain to how our uses of words depend on 
the contexts or connections (Zusammenhänge) on the ba-
sis of which such uses make sense and function in human 
life. While these uses are often readily intelligible to us in 
context, in the sense that we usually know how to respond 
correctly and skillfully to them in our actions (cf. PI §§150, 
199), it is very hard to attain an overview (Übersicht) of the 
diverse ways in which words are understood and used in 
context. We know how to do so in practice, but have great 
difficulty giving an explicit account of this sort of knowl-
edge: 
A main source of our failure to understand is that we 
don’t have an overview [übersehen] of the use of our 
words. – Our grammar is deficient in surveyability 
[Übersichtlichkeit]. – A surveyable presentation [über-
sichtliche Darstellung] produces precisely that kind of 
understanding which consists in “seeing connections” 
[“Zusammenhänge sehen”]. … The concept of a sur-
veyable presentation is of fundamental significance for 
us. It characterizes our form of presentation [Darstel-
lungsform], how we see things… (PI §122, emphases in 
the original, translation altered; cf. §125)5 
It is hard to attain an overview of the uses of words be-
cause their aims and functions (PI §5) are diverse, context-
dependent, and open-ended (PI §§11, 23), for this kind of 
overview requires that we take into account the particular 
circumstances in which words are used in each situation 
(PI §§154-5). There is no mechanical or context-
independent way of knowing in advance which aspects of 
particular circumstances are relevant for understanding the 
uses of words on each occasion. What is hidden concern-
ing the use and understanding of words, then, is not tran-
scendent and static, but immanent and dynamic to the 
phenomena with which they are connected. This is the 
immanent hidden.  
The translation of ‘übersichtliche Darstellung’ as ‘per-
spicuous or surveyable representation’ may suggest that 
such a representation is something obtained from a “God’s 
eye view” of things. But this cannot be what Wittgenstein 
has in mind in using this expression. For one thing, this 
construal opposes the general spirit of his way of thinking, 
which is hostile to the craving that we have for a transcen-
dent perspective on things that is external to any engage-
ment in human practices (forms of life). For another, the 
immanent hidden is not something we can fully represent 
by explicitly articulating it, but rather something we can 
only show by presenting it in certain ways through the use 
                                                      
3 See Braver (2012). 
4 I am indebted to Luntley for the remarks that follow (Luntley 2003: 51f.) 
5 Hacker and Schulte translate ‘übersichtliche Darstellung’ as ‘surveyable 
representation’. In German, however, ‘Darstellung’ usually means presenta-
tion, arrangement, installation, etc., and has an aspect of engaged involve-
ment on the part of the one to whom something is presented. By contrast, 
‘Vorstellung’ usually means representation or conception; the mode of en-
gagement from the one who represents or conceives something tends to be 
detached or theoretical. Thus I prefer translating ‘Darstellung’ and its cognates 
as ‘presentation’, not ‘representation’. Why this matters will become clear 
shortly.  
of examples or comparisons that cast light on similarities 
and dissimilarities among our uses of words in context (PI 
§130). For the immanent hidden is that transparent, and 
for this very reason inconspicuous and yet indispensable, 
background on which we can make sense of anything and 
act at all; in order to articulate it at all, we always already 
need to presuppose our very reliance on it. For this rea-
son, the immanent hidden is something that we can only 
get at by means of using a distinctive form of presentation 
(Darstellungsform) that serves a particular purpose. This 
form of presentation aims to show and thereby enable us, 
by means of such presentations, to see what is common 
(PI §72) to the use of words in contexts against the back-
ground of ordinary human life and over time. It is in this 
distinctive way that such presentations seek to be survey-
able or synoptic (übersichtlich).   
Now, what is striking for those familiar with early Hei-
degger’s philosophy in Sein und Zeit
6 (henceforth SZ) is 
the extent to which Wittgenstein’s later philosophy con-
verges with that of early Heidegger in this important re-
spect. For one of early Heidegger’s key aims in SZ is to 
show how the worldliness (Weltlichkeit) of the world is that 
basic indispensable existential structure (or space) of intel-
ligibility without which no human being can be agents or 
selves at all. In terms of early Heidegger’s vocabulary, the 
worldliness of the world has the following basic constitu-
ents and structure: (1) a set of holistically determined 
“ready-to-hand” (zuhandene) equipment, each of which is 
used for performing some specific task; (2) more encom-
passing short-term and medium-term goals which are ac-
complished by the execution of these nested tasks; and (3) 
the roles or self-interpretations for the sake of which 
(Worum-willen) human beings typically project and go on 
to actualize who they are (SZ §§14-8, 25-7, 31-2). This 
they do by engaging in activities that accomplish short-
term and medium-term nested goals that are bound up 
with some role or self-interpretation that they have either 
simply taken over without further ado or else deliberately 
chosen for themselves. As Heidegger shows, the world 
that engages and matters to us is always a pragmatically 
and holistically understood referential nexus of significance 
(Verweisungszusammenhang 
der 
Bedeutsamkeit 
[SZ 
§18]), on the basis of which phenomena initially and 
mostly make sense to us. Moreover, our understanding of 
the world as exhibiting this underlying pragmatic-holistic 
structure of intelligibility, i.e., the worldliness of the world, 
often goes unnoticed by us, functioning as an indispensa-
ble but largely inconspicuous context of situational mean-
ings that must already be in place in order for us to be 
goal-directed agents and human selves at all (SZ, pp. 69 
and 75). Not just this: It actually belongs to the inherent 
character of the world in its worldliness that it remains hid-
den, especially when our self-understandings and activities 
do not encounter occasions of breakdown (SZ, p. 65f. and 
§16). To adapt the words of the later Wittgenstein from PI 
§129, the early Heidegger emphasizes that the aspects of 
things that are the most important for our ability to be in the 
world in general, as engaged agents to whom things mat-
ter, remain hidden to us not because they are hard to find 
or to articulate, but rather because we must already rely on 
these very aspects of things – the worldliness of the world 
– in order to know our way around and accomplish our 
aims within some concrete form of life, let alone to make 
them explicit. Like the later Wittgenstein, the early Heideg-
ger tries to show in Division One of SZ that what is most 
striking and most powerful concerning our ability to be in 
the world is always something right before our very eyes in 
virtue of its simplicity and everydayness (Alltäglichkeit [SZ,

p. 43f., 66, §26]). In other words, what is most striking and 
most powerful is our understanding of the immanent hid-
den, i.e., our ongoing familiarity with existing and acting 
within a concrete space or structure of intelligibility (form of 
life).  
Limitation of space precludes me from further elaborat-
ing this convergence between the philosophies of the later 
Wittgenstein and the early Heidegger. Rather, I want to 
conclude this paper with a few suggestive remarks that 
concern their apparently similar conceptions of what a key 
aim of philosophy can be, in the course of getting rid of 
common misunderstandings about basic features of our 
human way of being in the world. In light of the discussion 
above of the inconspicuous and yet indispensable signifi-
cance of the immanent hidden or the worldliness of the 
world, it seems clear that one central (though perhaps not 
the only) aim of a correspondingly new way of doing phi-
losophy is to highlight, instructively describe, or to remind 
ourselves of what we always already inarticulately under-
stand in practice. But the phenomena that we seek to un-
derstand is not in the first instance something empirical, or 
rather, more carefully put, it is not something that can be 
exhaustively described or even fully captured by means of 
empirical descriptions and explanations. But neither is it 
something that can be explained or captured by means of 
constructively philosophical theories. Rather, once one has 
suitably understood the insights of the philosophies of the 
later Wittgenstein and the early Heidegger, the kind of 
phenomena on which a correspondingly transformed way 
of doing philosophy focuses are those that pertain pre-
cisely to the nature and philosophical ramifications of 
“lighting up” (as Heidegger would say) the immanent hid-
den or the worldliness of the world. This would constitute 
arguably the key aim of this transformed way of doing phi-
losophy. Its central goal is to highlight and enable us to 
see – not by means of providing straightforwardly empirical 
or else theoretical explanations, but rather by way of giving 
illuminating descriptions of – the indispensable signifi-
cance that the immanent hidden or the worldliness of the 
world has in our human way of being in the world. Accord-
ingly, the method for this task is “grammatical” in the later 
Wittgenstein’s rich sense of that word. One can also char-
acterize this method in terms of early Heidegger’s vocabu-
lary as hermeneutic phenomenology (SZ §7C, esp. 37f.). 
This method is hermeneutic because it not only acknowl-
edges but, indeed, positively appreciates the fact that we 
can never philosophize absent an inherited way of acting 
and thinking that always already provides us with a deter-
minate contingent conceptual apparatus (SZ, pp. 151-3, 
383-7). There is never the possibility of philosophizing in a 
“presuppositionless” way: We are always already moving 
within some sociohistorically determinate hermeneutic cir-
cle. This method is also phenomenological because it aims 
to carefully and instructively describe phenomena, paying 
attention especially to how such descriptions reveal the 
immanently hidden background against which we think 
and act (how they enable us to see connections of certain 
sorts [PI §122]). Their form of presentation (Darstellungs-
form) delivers finite, concrete, and yet illuminating informa-
tion about the indispensable structure that immanently 
hidden phenomena display and also enable. In so doing, 
phenomenological descriptions offer surveyable or synop-
tic presentations (übersichtliche Darstellungen) of the im-
manent hidden. In this spirit, I end with a passage from 
Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit that should resonate with PI 
§129:  
What is it that phenomenology is supposed to “enable 
us to see” [“sehen lassen” soll]? … Manifestly that 
which precisely does not initially and mostly show itself 
[:] that which, when compared with what initially and 
mostly shows itself, is hidden [verborgen], but at the 
same time is something that belongs essentially to what 
shows itself initially and mostly and, indeed, in such a 
way that it [i.e., what does not initially and mostly show 
itself – i.e., the immanent hidden] constitutes the sense 
and ground of what initially and mostly shows itself.

Wittgenstenian Form Of Life As Possibility Of Existence 
Emiliano La Licata 
Palermo, Italy | emiliano.lalicata@gmail.com 
Abstract 
Reading late Wittgenstein, I’m convinced that he believes forms of life are cultural constructions, certainly bridgeable and not 
incommensurable. Therefore, forms of life such as cultural and social constructions are differentiated and have dynamic and 
creative features. In the article, I work on the idea that form of life in Wittgenstein is a possibility of existence. Following the work 
of Agamben, I have presented arguments suggesting the idea that form of life as a cultural condition is certainly with a fixed and 
regulated shape, but this form could be creatively altered by human agency. It is an ongoing form, in evolution, temporary and 
manipulable by the creativity of humans. Following also the insights of von Wright, form of life is interpreted as an ongoing 
process and not something that is crystallized in a biological or cultural form. In other words, life is not structured in one or more 
static forms; it takes on a possible form, never final and always open to change in its becoming, making itself concrete and 
historical. Life takes a form that is not a priori, but is built on its development through non-deterministic processes. On the one 
hand, life takes on a certain form in its development, but at the same time an escape opens up from this temporary form. While 
it follows a path of historicization, the life form always has a forked path which can potentially lead it elsewhere and in an 
unpredictable direction. 
 
 
1 Form of life in Von Wright’s view 
Right at the beginning of PI, in paragraph 19, Wittgenstein 
invites us to imagine a simplified language—or at least 
different from the one we are used to every day. A lan-
guage “consisting only of orders and reports in battle.—Or 
a language consisting only of questions and expressions 
for answering yes and no. And innumerable others.” And 
then he concludes with one of his sibylline phrases: “—
And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of 
life” (PI: 19). 
Reading those and other similar phrases, one often asks 
oneself: how are concepts of language and form of life 
bound in the PI? What does “language is a form of life” 
mean? What does it mean that it is possible to imagine 
innumerable other languages and innumerable other forms 
of life? 
As we know, in PI Wittgenstein gives much consideration 
to praxis and action: speaking a language means striving 
to do things with others. Language directly involves the life 
of players in language games. It is easy to recognize a sort 
of supremacy of the deed in a notional life. Referring to 
objects, understanding a phrase, following a rule, meaning 
and even thinking are activities which involve the players 
in a regulated flexible space. Those activities involve the 
ordinary life of language game players. However, when 
Wittgenstein talks about life, to which life does he refer? To 
biological life? To social life? And in that case, which kind 
of biological life? Or which kind of social life? 
These pages are partly integrated in the interpretative 
tradition which sees the concept of life in PI as the life of 
communities producing cultures and manipulating the nat-
ural environment via their culture (See for instance Hacker 
2010). These communities are organized through the de-
velopment of a culture which enters in relation with nature. 
Cultures developed by communities, via a relation with the 
natural environment, permit adaptation to the world: they 
give meaning to it. Within this interpretative tradition, this 
paper tries to make things more complex. On the one 
hand, there is the attempt to give more dynamicity to pro-
cesses regarding form of life; on the other, an attempt to 
turn this dynamicity into an open and unforeseen process 
a priori, which leads to creative expression of the players. 
This paper wants to definitively sketch an idea of form of 
life which is seen as an ongoing process and not some-
thing fixed in a static form.  
A similar conception of form of life in late Wittgenstein 
philosophy is theorized by G.H. von Wright in his famous 
article “Wittgenstein in Relation to His Times”(Von Wright 
1982). He writes: 
It was his philosophical conviction that the life of the 
human individual and therefore also the all individual 
manifestations of culture are deeply entrenched in basic 
structures of a social nature. The structures in question 
are what Wittgenstein called ‘Lebensformen’, forms of 
life, and their embodiment in what he called ‘Sprach-
spiele’, language-games. They are ‘what has to be ac-
cepted, the given’, the unquestioned basis of all judging 
and thinking (Cf. Philosophical Investigations, Part II, p. 
226; On Certainty, § 229). This basis, to be sure, is not 
eternal and immutable. It is a product of human history 
and changes with history. It is something man made, 
and he changes. But how this happen is, according to 
Wittgenstein, not to be accounted for by a theory, or 
foreseen. ‘Wer kennt die Gesetze, nach denen die Ge-
sellschaft sich ändert?’ (‘Who knows the laws according 
to which society develops?’ (Culture and Value, p. 60), 
he asks, and adds: ‘Ich bin überzeugt, daβ auch der 
Gescheiteste keine Ahnung hat’ (‘I am quite sure they 
are closed book even to cleverest of men’ (ibid.)) (Von 
Wright 1982: 207). 
In these few lines, Von Wright focuses on many concepts 
regarding Lebensformen and the dynamics which are visi-
ble in language games. First, he uses the plural of Lebens-
form; this means that in Von Wright’s view human forms of 
life are multiple and, as we are going to see, open to dif-
ferentiation. He does not discuss just one human form of 
life, but forms of life which build up ways of living by play-
ing Sprachspiele. Not only does he highlight the intrinsi-
cally social nature of the form of life, he adds that this so-
cial nature is also political, in the Aristotlean sense: sub-
jects’ actions that collectively play language games alter 
forms of life towards an unpredictable horizon a priori. In 
other words, the actions of men brought together in com-
munities are, on the one hand, guided by shared habits 
without rational justification: they are simply accepted (See 
PI 241). On the other, the actions of socially connected 
subjects alter and move the background of shared cus-
toms belonging to the forms of life in a way which cannot

173
be predicted by a theory. Forms of life are inserted in the 
flow of history and the dynamics of this history are neither 
deterministic nor teleological, but simply political, in the 
sense mentioned above; that is, open to change through 
life in common. In other words, the public and social arena 
of the subjects playing language games together move the  
background of the form of life without following a prear-
ranged pattern. The following pages develop to a large 
extent what Von Wright says in that famous article. 
2. Form of life in Agamben’s view 
I do not only want to consider Von Wright. Indeed, his view 
of form of life leads us to a theory proposed for instance by 
Agamben in an essay from a couple of years ago, “Form-
of-Life” (Agamben 2000), in which he states that form of 
life is a possibility of existence. Like Von Wright he em-
phasises that Life is not structured in one or more static or 
eternal forms; instead life takes on a possible form which is 
never definitive and always open to change in its becom-
ing. In its making concrete and historical, life takes on form 
which is not pre-defined a priori, but builds itself up in its 
developing through non deterministic processes. Life is not 
crystallized in a stable form, it certainly takes on one or 
more forms in its process of becoming, but simultaneously, 
while it becomes historical—and thus takes on a form—, it 
is opened up to flight lines from this temporary form it has 
taken.  
What does this formulation mean? (Form of Life) It de-
fines a life —human life—in which the single ways, acts 
and processes of living are never are simply facts but al-
ways and above all possibilities of life, always and above 
all power. Each behavior and each form of human living is 
never prescribed by a specific biological vocation, nor it is 
assigned by whatever necessity, instead, no matter how 
customary, repeated and socially compulsory, it always 
retains the character of possibility; that is, it always puts at 
stake living itself (Agamben 2000: 3). 
In its process of historicization, form of life, as a possibil-
ity of existence, on the one hand, takes on an existing 
form; on the other, it alters the inherited background be-
cause life always has bifurcating paths ahead which can 
potentially lead it in an unpredictable direction. The idea is 
that form of life, on the one hand, defines existence by 
constructing a pattern of rules which establish a symbolic 
order within which it is possible to play. On the other, while 
it is intent on ritually repeating constituted symbolic order, 
it continually distances itself from that order, from the order 
it has defined and excluded from other possibilities of exis-
tence, to offer itself to experimentation and creativity. From 
my point of view, Wittgenstein has a similar idea of form of 
life (see also La Licata 2012 and 2013).The very first ar-
gument I want to bring in order to support this thesis is that 
the verb “Imagine” (vorstellen) of PI 19 goes back to the 
semantic sphere of diversification, of alterity. The grammar 
of “imagining” implies the idea of alterity. You can imagine 
something that does not exist, but that could exist:  
If anyone believes that certain concepts are absolutely 
the correct ones, and that having different ones would 
mean not realizing something that we realize, then let 
him imagine (vorstellen) certain very general facts of 
nature to be different from what we are used to, and the 
formation of concepts different from the usual ones will 
become intelligible to him (PI II: xii, 366). 
For Wittgenstein, it is possible to imagine forms of life 
completely different from ours, shared behavior which is 
unthinkable with our concepts, but, assuming they ex-
isted—and nothing in principle can prevent their being—
they would be perfectly meaningful, perfectly thinkable. 
The concept of diversification is intrinsic to  Wittgenstenian 
form of life. In the essays “The Normal and The Natural” 
and “Declining Decline”, Cavell has highlighted this contin-
gent and creative character of the form of life (Cavell 1996 
and 1996a). Cavell has highlighted the nexus which bonds 
language and form of life: learning to speak means living 
and developing a life in common with others; it means ac-
cepting as natural the ways of living which develop be-
tween people. Therefore, he has highlighted that this natu-
rality is a contingent process which could have been dif-
ferent and could be different. He has reaffirmed that our 
accepted meanings are set down on weak ground, on a 
precarious basis: language and forms of life are objects in 
evolution, contingent and unforeseen. 
3. Form of life as possibility of existence 
Now, I want to draw other arguments into the idea that 
form of life theorized by Wittgenstein is a possibility if exis-
tence and not the closed and static structure. Wittgenstein 
describes in PI 23:  
The word “language-game” is used here to emphasize 
the fact that the speaking of language is part of an ac-
tivity (Tätigkeit), or of a form of life”. 
It is very clear that Wittgenstein links form of life to an ac-
tivity. Expressly Wittgenstein associates form of life with a 
dynamic dimension represented by actions which consti-
tute an activity. But, what could form of life being an activ-
ity mean? The issue at stake posed by the answer directly 
involves the issue regarding the interpretation of Wittgen-
stenian form of life: that is, whether to interpret form of life 
as a static and closed container or, as I wish it to be, duc-
tile although not docile ground, on which human agency 
must act in order to construct a possible semantic order 
that is always provisional and anyway unstable. 
First, an activity is a process which develops over time. 
An activity presupposes a series of events which can fol-
low a pattern and be achieved diluting itself in a temporal 
sphere. Secondly, fulfilling an activity is a system of events 
which presupposes relationality; in the sense that, by de-
veloping an activity, you are in relation with persons and 
things. Therefore activity is a structure of events which 
presupposes rules and patterns immersed in a contingent, 
temporal flow. Rules and patterns are ritualized in lan-
guage games and put in relation to persons and things. 
Therefore, according to Wittgenstein Dynamicity and rela-
tionality are characteristics of activities and, thus, of forms 
of life.  
Therefore, form of life is dynamic and regulated activity. 
However, in my opinion it is something more. There is also 
something about the openness of this activity to multiple 
existences. From my perspective, form of life as activity is 
not a closed pattern of actions, it is not ritualized in the 
repetition of behavior but, while certainly following a script, 
it could easily deviate. It could easily move forward, since 
during every repetition of activity, one can make changes, 
more or less consciously, which could flow into something 
innovative, something unknown in the past. 
Let us read paragraph 241 in order to outline another 
fundamental characteristic of the form of life, which sug-
gests that it is meant as intrinsically open to differentiation: 
“So you are saying that human agreement decides 
what is true and what is false?” What is true or false is 
what human beings say; and it is in their language that 

Wittgenstenian Form Of Life As Possibility Of Existence | Emiliano La Licata 
 
 
 174
human beings agree. This is agreement not in opinions, 
but rather in form of life. 
Following what has been said in the previous paragraph, if 
the criteria of truth and false are not founded on discursive 
rationality which establishes what is truth and what is false, 
but on a form of life, then it is licit to think that form of life 
has no prescribed structure, no structure a priori. If form of 
life had a prescribed structure, it would be verbalizable, 
easily expressible through discursive rationality. Therefore, 
if form of life has no predefined structure, but it is, as I be-
lieve, a potentiality, it takes on a possible shape a posteri-
ori; that is, while human agency intervenes. Form of life 
takes on a possible form while it lives, during its process of 
historicization.  
If you agree with this position, form of life cannot be bio-
logical life, dominated by natural needs. Neither is life cir-
cumscribed and constrained by the rules of cultural life. It 
is not pre-scribed in a cultural form. It certainly takes on 
cultural forms, it must take them on while it goes through 
history; but, form of life, potentially, is and remains free to 
take on other forms. It is free to differentiate, even when it 
is constrained within cultural rules. 
In other words, form of life has no prefixed structure, has 
no form a priori which can be expressed through laws, 
natural or even cultural rules which describe what it is. 
Form of life takes on historical forms and cultural coher-
ence; but, it takes them on through a dynamic process 
which involves relationships of subjectification, learning 
and rejecting the existing games. Form of life is always a 
possibility of existence. Even when it takes on a form, form 
of life has always the possibility to leave it during its proc-
ess of historicization. It always has bifurcating paths which 
can lead it elsewhere. In this sense, it is possible to imag-
ine innumerable forms of life and imagine other general 
facts which are thinkable and meaningful.  
Since form of life is potentially undefined, theoretically it 
is possible to create innumerable other orders of rules, 
habits and customs which give coherence to existence. 
So, form of life takes on regularities by ritually repeating 
a pattern of actions codified in language games. However, 
it also takes on a form which remains dynamic since the 
constituted order can be moved to something unpredict-
able. Dynamicity and potentiality of form of life can be 
noted on one hand, by seeing how it has no prefixed struc-
ture; on the other, by seeing that it takes on order while it 
repeats a system of actions in language games. This pat-
tern of actions is then altered and moved to something un-
predictable. Therefore, forms of life are potentialities 
which, in their historical development, take on patterns of 
habit. These patterns are repeated in language games. 
However, starting from those patterns, processes of differ-
entiation begin in an unpredictable way just because form 
of life has a potential character. 
4. Form of life as potential and dynamic ob-
ject 
I would now like to further clarify the issue at stake by relo-
cating the concept of form of life from a closed container to 
a possibility of existence. If we interpret form of life as 
something static, crystallized and prescribed, then it will be 
defined by a list of characteristics. These characteristics 
can be rules of language games, tribal habits and cus-
toms, universal characteristics which distinguish human 
beings from other natural species. They can be transcen-
dental categories which can make human experience pos-
sible. Therefore, one presupposes something which al-
ready has a form which is set either before experience in a 
kind of Kantian transcendentalism, or experience such as 
in an anthropology of habits and customs of tribes. On the 
contrary, if we interpret form of life as undefined possibility 
of existence which becomes historical, then it will be an 
ongoing process which takes a momentary form through 
linguistic practices, that is patterns of behavior in language 
games. Via the construction of semantic borders which are 
achieved with linguistic activity, form of life maintains regu-
larities; but, due to its potential character, it is always ready 
to deviate to something undefinable a priori. Form of life is 
then something which turns into a form and which is not 
already a form. Furthermore, when it takes on a form, that 
form is unstable, since, on the one hand, it set on flexible 
and dynamic ground which can lead it elsewhere. On the 
other, the form is still a pattern of socially accepted habits. 
Once a form is taken, it is always possible to go else-
where, to tread different routes. When it is crystallized in a 
repetition of behavior patterns, form of life is already pro-
pelled in other directions or is moved towards something 
different, towards continual differentiation. In other words, 
form of life is a potentiality which defines itself, which tends 
to take on a form. However, potential disorder, which can 
lead elsewhere, remains at the margins of this form. This 
potentiality continually redefines and recombines the fea-
tures of the form. For all those reasons, from my point of 
view, Wittgenstenian form of life is not definitive, it is not a 
transcendental object, neither is it a platonic object nor a 
science research subject.

On Boyd's Rebuttal of Kripke's Argument for Dualism 
Klaus Ladstaetter 
Topeka, KS, USA | klaus.ladstaetter@washburn.edu 
Abstract 
The essay presents Saul Kripke's argument for mind/body-dualism and makes the suppositions explicit on which it rests. My 
claim, inspired by Richard Boyd, is that even if one of Kripke’s central suppositions - the principle of necessity of identities using 
rigid designators - is shared by the non-traditional identity theorist, it is still possible for her to rebut Kripke’s dualism. 
 
 
Introduction 
The plan for the essay is first to present Kripke’s argument 
for mind/body-dualism and to make the suppositions ex-
plicit on which it rests. Second, traditional identity theory is 
distinguished from non-traditional identity theory, if only to 
set aside further discussion of traditional identity theory. 
My claim is that even if one of Kripke’s central suppositions 
- the principle of necessity of identities using rigid designa-
tors - is accepted by the non-traditional identity theorist, it 
is still possible for her to rebut Kripke’s dualism. The third 
section expounds the non-traditional identity theorist’s 
possible appeal to an analogy in order to explain the rela-
tion between mental phenomena (e.g. pain) and physical 
phenomena (e.g. C-fiber stimulation), while section four 
reconstructs Kripke’s attack on this analogy. Refuting 
Kripke’s attack in light of Boyd’s proposals in section five, I 
conclude that non-traditional identity theory is viable. 
1. Kripke’s Argument for Mind/Body-
Dualism 
Kripke (1980) wants to defend some form of dualism (with-
out defending Cartesian substance dualism though). In 
order to do so, he uses the Cartesian Intuition, i.e. the in-
tuition that it is possible that the mind exist without the 
body and that it is possible that the body exist without the 
mind. In other words, Kripke deems it possible that there 
be disembodied minds (or “pure souls”) and that there be 
“disminded” bodies (or “zombies”); either way - it is possi-
ble that the mind is different from the body, schematically 
represented by: 
 (A ≠ B)
1 
Due to his conception of names as rigid designators, 
Kripke is committed to what he calls the principle of neces-
sity of identities using rigid designators (cf. Kripke 1980, 
e.g. p.146). Henceforth, I shall call this principle (PNIRD): 
(A = B)   (A = B)
2 
Notice that the logically equivalent contrapositive of this 
principle is: 
 (A ≠ B)  (A ≠ B)
3 
                                                      
1 As it is common, I use the symbol “” as abbreviation of the sentential opera-
tor “it is possible that” and the symbol “” as abbreviation of the phrase “it is 
necessary that”. Kripke insists that he is concerned with metaphysical modali-
ties (cf. Kripke 1980, e.g. p.35); his view will not be challenged here. 
2 For what follows, the reader should take the letter “A” as a place holder for a 
name of a mental phenomenon (e.g. pain), and the letter “B” as a place holder 
for a name of a physical phenomenon (e.g. C-fiber stimulation). 
3 For the sake of the argument, I’ll suppose that (PNIRD) and its equivalent 
contrapositive are true. I shall thus put aside the obvious objection to the con-
trapositive that possibility does not imply actuality. 
Kripke argues that the Cartesian Intuition taken together 
with the (PNIRD) entails the view that mental phenomena 
are actually different from physical phenomena; here’s the 
reconstruction of his argument: 
 
(1)   (A ≠ B) 
Cartesian Intuition 
(2)  (A = B)   (A = B) 
(PNIRD) 
(3)   (A ≠ B)  (A ≠ B) 
from 2, by contraposition 
(4)  A ≠ B 
from 1, 3, by modus ponens 
2. Mind/Body-Identity Theory 
In order to characterize identity theory, it is advisable to 
distinguish between traditional and non-traditional identity 
theory. A traditional identity theorist (whether type or to-
ken) rejects the (PNIRD) and thus accepts its negation: 
((A = B)   (A = B)) 
which is logically equivalent to: 
(A = B) &  (A = B)
4 
The traditional identity theorist thus claims (in the first con-
junct) that, as a matter of fact about the actual world, it is 
true that pain is identical with C-fiber stimulation, but - 
when sharing the Cartesian Intuition (in the second con-
junct) - the theorist adds that this is not necessarily true; it 
is possibly false because we can imagine a world in which 
pain exists without there being any C-fiber stimulation (e.g. 
in “pure souls”) and because we can imagine a world in 
which C-fiber stimulation exists without there being any 
pain (e.g. in “zombies”).  
Kripke thinks that traditional identity theory is simply 
false because it is committed to an incorrect conception of 
names as non-rigid designators. I shall share Kripke’s 
supposition of names as rigid designators and of the 
(PNIRD) throughout this essay; so I shall set aside further 
discussion of traditional identity theory here. The goal of 
the essay rather is to show that even if an identity theorist 
shares Kripke’s supposition, it is possible for her to rebut 
Kripke’s dualism. 
Non-traditional identity theory (whether type or token) 
accepts the conception of names as rigid designators and 
the (PNIRD) and is thus committed to the argument: 
 
 
(1)  A = B 
Identity Theorist’s Intuition 
(2)  (A = B)   (A = B) 
(PNIRD) 
(3)   (A = B)

from 1, 2, by modus ponens 
                                                      
4 This claim is in turn logically equivalent to: (A = B) &  (A ≠ B)

Now, the non-traditional identity theorist cannot attack the 
validity of Kripke’s argument from the Cartesian Intuition 
and the (PNIRD). So she must, in an effort to establish that 
his argument is unsound, rather attack the Cartesian Intui-
tion itself (i.e. the negation of the conclusion of her own 
argument) - by showing, for instance, that it is impossible 
that pain be different from C-fiber stimulation. 
3. The Non-Traditional Identity Theorist’s 
Analogy 
The non-traditional identity theorist (henceforth, the identity 
theorist) wants to hold: 
A = B 
but cannot at the same time hold: 
 (A ≠ B) 
For the latter claim contradicts the conclusion of her own 
argument, and the conjunction of both claims entails that 
the identity statement is merely contingent (which would 
render her a traditional identity theorist). Instead, the iden-
tity theorist must hold:  
 (A ≠ B) 
The challenge for her, then, is to say why the above iden-
tity statement is only seemingly contingent. The identity 
theorist must thus explain away its apparent contingency. 
In particular, she must explain why it is only apparently 
possible that pain not be identical with C-fiber stimulation, 
while it is in fact impossible.  
Kripke thinks that the identity theorist cannot meet this 
challenge. In his view, she fails to explain away the appar-
ent contingency of the identity statement - even if the iden-
tity theorist employs the following analogy and claims: 
(1A) The situation regarding the statement “pain = C-
fiber stimulation” is just like the situation regard-
ing the statement “water = H2O”. 
(2A) Also the statement: 
 
 Water = H2O 
 
has frequently been deemed merely a contingent 
 
truth, but - due to Kripke’s work - it has turned out 
 
to be a necessary truth. 
(3A) The explanation why this statement has fre-
quently been seen merely as a contingent truth is that 
there has been a tendency to mistake it for the state-
ment: 
 
 The phenomenon felt as water = H2O
6 
(4A) Now, this statement is admittedly merely contin-
gently true, i.e. it is true in the actual world, but: 
 
 (a)  it is possible that the phenomenon felt as  
 
 water exist without the presence of H2O, i.e.  
 
 water (e.g. on Twin-Earth); and 
 
 (b)  it is possible that H2O, i.e. water, exist  
 
 without the presence of the phenomenon felt  
 
 as water (e.g. in a world inhabited by alien  
 
 creatures who have entirely different sensations  
 
 produced by H2O). 
                                                                             
5 Notice that this claim is logically equivalent to:  (A ≠ B) and thus to the 
negation of the Cartesian Intuition. 
6 Alternatively: The phenomenon that produces the sensation we call “the 
sensation of water” = H2O. 
(5A) And the situation is analogous for the statement 
“pain = C-fiber stimulation”. 
4. Kripke’s Attack on the Analogy 
Kripke thinks that the identity theorist cannot employ the 
above line of reasoning because, per the analogy, the 
identity theorist would be committed to claim: 
(2B) Also the statement: 
 Pain = C-fiber stimulation 
has frequently been deemed merely a contingent 
truth, but - upon reflection - it has turned out to be 
a necessary truth. 
(3B) The explanation why this statement has fre-
quently been seen merely as a contingent truth is 
that there has been a tendency to mistake it for 
the statement: 
 The phenomenon felt as pain = C-fiber  
 stimulation
7 
 
But it is precisely at this point where the analogy breaks 
down for Kripke. For the identity theorist cannot continue 
to argue: 
(4B) Now, this statement is admittedly merely contin-
gently true, i.e. it is true in the actual world, but: 
(a)  it is possible that the phenomenon felt as 
pain exist without the presence of C-fiber 
stimulation, i.e. pain (e.g. in “pure souls”); 
and 
(b)  it is possible that C-fiber stimulation, i.e. 
pain, exist without the presence of the phe-
nomenon felt as pain (e.g. in “zombies”). 
The identity theorist’s appeal to this analogy is not viable 
for Kripke, because he thinks that there is no possible 
world in which the phenomenon felt as pain is different 
from pain -  thus rendering the statement: 
The phenomenon felt as pain = pain 
a necessary truth
8, while he also thinks that there is a pos-
sible world in which the phenomenon felt as water is differ-
ent from water - thus rendering the statement: 
The phenomenon felt as water = water 
merely a contingent truth (even though “water = H2O” is a 
necessary truth).  
Kripke therefore believes that the identity theorist cannot 
explain away the apparent contingency of the statement 
“pain = C-fiber stimulation” by appeal to the analogy. The 
identity theorist consequently has to bite the bullet and to 
accept the Cartesian Intuition:  
 (A ≠ B) 
But from this premise, together with (PNIRD), it immedi-
ately follows that: 
A ≠ B 
And so Kripke concludes that some form of dualism is true, 
while identity theory is false.  
                                                      
7 Alternatively: The phenomenon that produces the sensation we call “the 
sensation of pain” = C-fiber stimulation. 
8 Notice that for Kripke, then, there is a definite description that is a rigid des-
ignator.

5. The Identity Theorist’s Rebuttal 
Boyd (1980, cf. p.83ff.) attempts to refute Kripke’s attack 
on the analogy by arguing from the identity theorist’s point 
of view as follows: 
(1C) The situation regarding the statement “pain = C-
fiber stimulation” is exactly like the situation re-
garding the statement “water = H2O”. 
(2C) The statement: 
Water = H2O 
is - due to Kripke’s work - indeed a necessary 
truth. 
(3C) But the explanation why this statement has fre-
quently been seen merely as a contingent truth is 
rather that there has been a tendency to mistake 
it for the statement: 
Water = the phenomenon identified as H2O 
by standard tests available in the actual 
world 
9 
(4C) Now, this statement is admittedly merely contin-
gently true, i.e. it is true in the actual world, but: 
(a)  it is possible that water exist without the 
presence of standard tests available in the 
actual world to identify the phenomenon as 
H2O; and  
(b)  it is possible that standard tests available in 
the actual world to identify the phenomenon 
as H2O exist without the presence of water.   
(5C) And this situation is precisely analogous for the 
statement “pain = C-fiber stimulation”. 
For, per Boyd, the analogy expands as follows: 
(2D) True, the statement: 
Pain = C-fiber-stimulation. 
is a necessary truth. 
(3D) However, the explanation why this statement has 
frequently been seen merely as a contingent truth 
is that there has been a tendency to mistake it for 
the statement: 
Pain = the phenomenon identified as C-
fiber stimulation by standard tests available 
in the actual world 
10 
(4D) Now, this statement is admittedly merely contin-
gently true, i.e. it is true in the actual world, but: 
(a)  it is possible that pain exist without the pres-
ence of standard tests available in the actual 
world to identify the phenomenon as C-fiber 
stimulation; and  
(b)  it is possible that standard tests available in 
the actual world to identify the phenomenon 
as C-fiber stimulation exist without the pres-
ence of pain.   
The identity theorist’s appeal to this analogy is viable for 
Boyd, because he thinks that there is a possible world in 
which the phenomenon identified as C-fiber-stimulation by 
standard tests available in the actual world is different from 
pain and because he also thinks that there is a possible 
                                                      
9 Alternatively: Water = the liquid that ___ (where a description of standard 
tests to identify water in the actual world goes into the blank). 
10 Alternatively: Pain = the phenomenon that ___ (where a description of 
standard tests to identify C-fiber stimulation in the actual world goes into the 
blank). 
world in which the phenomenon identified as H2O by stan-
dard tests available in the actual world is different from 
water. Boyd thus thinks that both the statement: 
Pain = the phenomenon identified as C-fiber-stimulation 
by standard tests available in the actual world 
and the statement: 
Water = the phenomenon identified as H2O by standard 
tests available in the actual world 
are merely contingent and not necessary truths (even 
though “water = H2O” and “pain = C-fiber stimulation” are 
both necessary truths). 
Conclusion 
I agree with Boyd that the identity theorist can explain 
away the merely apparent contingency of the statement 
“pain = C-fiber stimulation”. While Kripke focuses on the 
left-hand sides of the identity statements “water = H2O” 
and “pain = C-fiber-stimulation” and replaces them with 
mentalistic definite descriptions of the form “the phenome-
non felt as ___” in order to establish the alleged disanal-
ogy, Boyd focuses on the right-hand sides of the identity 
statements and replaces them with physicalistic definite 
descriptions of the form “the phenomenon identified as ___ 
by standard tests available in the actual world” in order to 
establish the analogy. 
And Boyd is right. Water is not identical with the phe-
nomenon felt as water; rather it is identical with the phe-
nomenon identified as H2O by standard tests available in 
the actual world. Likewise, pain is not identical with the 
phenomenon felt as pain; rather it is identical with the phe-
nomenon identified as C-fiber stimulation by standard tests 
available in the actual world.  
Hence, the identity theorist can hold that the case of pain 
being identical with C-fiber stimulation is just like other 
cases of identity, e.g. that of water being identical with 
H2O, or that of heat being identical with mean molecular 
energy, etc. The theorist can thus reject the Cartesian In-
tuition and accept its negation: 
 (A ≠ B) 
in which case the she does not have to accept Kripke’s 
conclusion that some form of dualism is true. Instead, the 
identity theorist can maintain that materialism (preferably 
some form of non-reductive token materialism) is true, and 
she can at the same time commit herself to the (PNIRG).

Abstract 
In recent pragmatic theory it is held that in uttering sentences or sentence fragments, speakers express more than they articu-
late. I distinguish two strategies for capturing the underdeterminacy of the articulated with respect to the information which is 
expressed by an utterance. The first strategy is to assume unarticulated constituents as part of the utterance which is under-
stood by the addressee. The second is to avoid this assumption and to rely instead on information of the utterance context, not 
being projected upon the utterance content itself. I argue that the second strategy should be pursued, and the case of and-
conjunction is chosen in order to demonstrate the advantage of it.  
 
 
What is articulated – what is expressed 
I want to propose a rather simple bifurcation of an utter-
ance into two aspects. I distinguish the features of a sen-
tence or fragment which allows us to draw pragmatic infer-
ences on the one hand from the results of these inferences 
drawn from the utterance of this sentence or fragment on 
the other. Terminologically, this is represented by the dis-
tinction between what is articulated (the uttered sentence / 
fragment) and what is expressed (the result of the infer-
ences). In this paper, I want to argue that we should aban-
don the concept of unarticulated constituents, being a non-
articulated part of the uttered sentence, and to replace it 
by a concept which doesn’t assume non-articulated items 
as constituents of the uttered sentence. As an alternative I 
make use of the concept of a pragmatic template which 
has been introduced elsewhere (s. Liedtke 2013). It re-
flects the fact that understanding an utterance is possible 
because addressees dispose of correlations between ut-
terance-types and types of environment and therefore are 
able to arrive at an understanding by means of context-
knowledge; in other words, they have knowledge of lan-
guages games (s. Wittgenstein 2010, § 23). In arguing for 
the concept of pragmatic templates, I will discuss the no-
tions of a lekton and of an Austinian proposition, which are 
being introduced by F. Récanati (2007) (who cites J. Bar-
wise 1989). Against this background, I will have a look on 
the case of “and”-conjunction with special emphasis on the 
question of how one has to represent the communicative 
content – what is expressed – in comparison with the envi-
ronment of the utterance not being part of it.  
To begin impressionistically, I want consider the follow-
ing examples: 
(1) It’s summer in England and it’s winter in New Zea-
land. (s. Carston 1994, 2002) 
(2) He cut the bread and (he) put cheese on the slices.  
(3) He had a headache and (he) went to bed. 
(4) (a) You turn the key and the engine starts. 
(4) (b) Turn the key and the engine starts. 
(5) The pupil said “There is fire alarm” and the teacher 
stopped the examination.  
(6) The teacher said “O.k.” and ended the lesson.   
(7) ?She said “Go out.” and ordered him to leave.  
(8) 
?He pressed the bell and rang. 
(9) 
?She poured poison into his wine and killed him. 
In all these cases, the conjunction “and” which is articu-
lated has to be enriched in order to obtain a complete 
proposition. Even in the first case where at a first glance 
we don’t see any necessity to enrich, there is a condition 
of relevance which encompasses a contrast between a 
country in the northern and a country in the southern 
hemisphere (s. Carston 2002, 245). 
Unarticulated constituents 
If we formulate this fact in a more customary way, we have 
to describe the development from the articulated to the 
expressed in terms of unarticulated constituents or free 
enrichment (for unarticulated constituents s. Perry 1998, 
Récanati 2002, 2010). Thus in the case of (2), we have to 
add then, …, in (3), we have the articulated portion plus 
two unarticulated constituents, then and therefore, in 
(4 a/b) we get consequently, in (5) then + conse-
quently, in the non-doxastic case of (6) we get thereby. 
It is interesting by the way that no lexical entry seems to 
exist that allows to differentiate between causal and inten-
tional consequences – it is both consequently or the like. 
Thus the examples have to be enriched in the following 
way: 
(2) He cut the bread and then, … (he) put cheese on 
the slices 
(3) He had a headache and then, … + therefore, … 
(he) went to bed. 
(4) (a) You turn the key and consequently, … the en-
gine starts. 
(4) (b) Turn the key and consequently, … the engine 
starts. 
(5) The pupil said “There is fire alarm” and then, … + 
consequently, … the teacher stopped the examina-
tion.  
(6) The teacher said “O.k.” and thereby, … (he) 
ended the lesson.   
I want to point to the fact that an analysis of these cases in 
terms of unarticulated constituents (in the following u.c.) is 
problematic from several reasons. One important reason is 
that it is by no means clear that the constituents which 
have been added in (2) through (6) are what the speaker 
really had in mind. In my view choosing words for express-
ing relations between states-of-affairs is extremely context-
dependent, and we don’t have a constant means for say-
ing that “then” or “consequently” has to be added.

Propositions and environments 
In his book ‘Perspectival Thought’ (2007), Récanati uses a 
specific terminology for determining the role of u.c. He dis-
tinguishes between the explicit content of an utterance 
which he dubs with a stoicist term the lekton, and the com-
plete content of that utterance, which is called the Austin-
ian proposition (after J. Barwise / Etchemendy 1987). The 
complete content of the Austinian proposition encom-
passes the circumstance of evaluation in which the utter-
ance had been performed – or, in terms of Perry, the situa-
tion the utterance concerns (s. Perry 1986). Following Ré-
canati, utterances are context-sensitive because the (ex-
plicit) content expressed by that sentence, which is called 
the lekton, is evaluated with respect to varying circum-
stances. (s. Récanati 2007). 
The result of this strategy is that we have three levels of 
meaning of an utterance: the meaning of the sentence 
type , the context-dependent lekton and the Austinian 
proposition (s. Récanati 2007). Concerning the third level, 
it contributes to the truth conditions of the uttered sen-
tence, i.e. it is true or false concerning the respective cir-
cumstance of evaluation. Consequently the locus for u.c. is 
not the lekton, but the Austinian proposition, the circum-
stance of the utterance which co-determines its truth-
value: “… there are no unarticulated constituents in the 
lekton – all unarticulated constituents belong to the situa-
tion of evaluation.” (Récanati 2010, 23). 
In the course of his book on Perspectival Thought 
(2007), Récanati develops a theory of the lekton / situa-
tion-distinction in terms of the distinction between the con-
tent and the mode of a representation. It is formulated in 
analogy to the distinction between the propositional con-
tent and the illocutionary force of a speech act (or the rep-
resentative content and the psychological mode of an In-
tentional state) in the Searlean framework (s. Searle 
1983). Consequently, the lekton corresponds to the pro-
positional content of a speech act or the representative 
content of an Intentional state, the Austinian proposition 
corresponds to the illocutionary force or the psychological 
mode of an Intentional state.  
The relation between the propositional act and the illocu-
tionary act is clearly defined: in performing a propositional 
act, we perform an illocutionary act, this relation being 
possible because there are constitutive rules governing 
language-specific conventions. The relation between the 
content and the mode of a mental state is so defined that 
“… every Intentional state consists of a representative con-
tent in a certain psychological mode.” (Searle 1983, 11) 
The Intentional state that H wants A to leave the room 
consists of the representative content that A will leave the 
room in the psychological mode of a wish. The Intentional 
state just mentioned is connected with the respective 
speech act (propositional content: that A will leave the 
room; illocutionary force: directive) via the notion of the 
sincerity condition in the following sense: H’s wish that A 
leave the room is the sincerity condition for the corre-
sponding directive speech act of ordering that A should 
leave the room (Searle 1983, 9). Both, the Intentional state 
and the speech act, are defined by their conditions of sat-
isfaction. “… Intentional states with a propositional content 
and a direction of fit represent their various conditions of 
satisfaction in the same sense that speech acts with a 
propositional content and a direction of fit represent their 
conditions of satisfaction.” (ibid. 11) Thus the function of 
Intentional states and speech acts is to represent their re-
spective conditions of satisfaction (truth, obedience, …), 
whereas the former are the sincerity condition of the latter.  
The analogy of the speech act / Intentional state-model 
to the relation of articulated / unarticulated constituents is – 
as we saw - such that the articulated / unarticulated-
distinction is defined by Récanati (2007) in terms of the 
content / mode-distinction as laid down in Searle’s book 
Intentionality. The articulated part of  
(10) It is raining. 
is that it is raining, the unarticulated part is the location, 
e.g. here. Just as the propositional content and the illocu-
tionary force form the complete speech act and the repre-
sentational content and the psychological mode form the 
complete Intentional state, the lekton and the situation 
form the Austinian proposition or the complete content of 
an utterance.  
I agree to the general idea underlying the account of Ré-
canati, which removes unarticulated constituents from the 
lekton and represents them as part of the situation in 
which the utterance has been performed. However I am 
skeptical about the architecture of his proposal. I think it is 
problematic to conceive of the relation between the articu-
lated and the unarticulated in terms of a speech act / an 
Intentional state simply because an utterance like (10) and 
the place in which it has been performed or to which it re-
fers are not necessarily part of a single linguistic or mental 
act. A speech act and an Intentional state is an activity of a 
person, ‘having’ a state in a certain mode, but the utter-
ance in a situation or a certain circumstance is not as a 
whole an activity of a person – the situation is nothing the 
person performs or even has, but it is something which is 
(naively spoken) already there – or which is collectively 
constructed in a more interactional view of contexts. In ad-
dition, it would be an advantage if one could indicate a 
small number of types into which Austinian propositions 
could be divided, just as mental acts (Belief and Desire) or 
speech acts (five classes) are. In the next paragraph I will 
argue that it might be possible to identify some stereotypi-
cal situations which are responsible for interpreting prag-
matically underdetermined utterances, but I am rather sure 
that we do not dispose of a straightforward taxonomy 
which is comparable to the taxonomy of speech acts prof-
fered by Searle (1982) or others. 
Pragmatic templates 
In the following I want to propose an alternative way of 
conceiving of the articulated / expressed-distinction, with-
out supposing an overarching proposition which encom-
passes the chosen words and the items of the environ-
ment of the utterance. Contrary to the picture sketched 
above, I presume that addressees of utterances have (be-
yond the uttered sentence or sentence fragment) a cluster 
of items of contextual information at their disposal, which 
they use in order to ascribe a communicative content to 
the utterance.  
In my view the content of an unarticulated constituent or 
an Austinian proposition (which in my reception of Réca-
nati is very akin to what-is-said) may be considered as a 
part of such a pragmatic template – it is part of the knowl-
edge of language users which is activated when they hear 
or read an utterance where not everything is articulated 
that could be relevant in that situation. In his remarks 
about performative utterances, J.L. Austin presented sev-
eral examples of those clusters, which he formulated as 
felicity conditions for those utterances. The taxonomy of 
speech acts of J.R. Searle contains the classes of expres-
sives and declarations which are in part ritualized and de-
termined to specific situations. Beyond these cases, I de-

fine templates as holistic clusters of relations between ut-
tered sentences with a meaning on the one side and ele-
ments of the utterance situation on the other (for a more 
detailed account s. Liedtke 2013, 194 ff.).  
Conjunciton-types  
Let me discuss the idea of templates using the example of 
“and”-conjunction. As we will see, the manifold cases of 
“and”-conjunction with respect to enrichments seem to re-
duce to a few types, which are rather general.  The rele-
vant features generating the types are +SEQUENTIAL vs. -
SEQUENTIAL, +CONSEQUENTIAL vs. -CONSEQUENTIAL, and 
+NATURAL vs. -NATURAL. I borrowed the dichotomy “natural 
vs. non-natural” from H.P. Grice’s theory of meaning (s. 
Grice 1989) in order to hint at the fact that sometimes the 
reported sequence might be the outcome of an established 
practice (the minus or non-natural case, as in (12) or (15)) 
and sometimes simply a causal result of the event men-
tioned in the first conjunct (the plus natural case, as in (11) 
or (13), where the darkness of a cinema hall plays a 
role).In order to get an impression of the possible cases 
which might be distinguished, consider the following ex-
amples: 
(11) She pushed the domino and the row collapsed. 
+SEQUENTIAL, +CONSEQUENTIAL, + NATURAL 
(12) He robbed the bank and he was sentenced to five 
years of prison. +SEQUENTIAL, +CONSEQUENTIAL, - 
NATURAL 
(13) He went to the movies and read a mystery novel in 
the evening. +SEQUENTIAL, -CONSEQUENTIAL, +NATURAL 
(14) The tree fell to the ground and there was a huge 
crash.  –SEQUENTIAL, +CONSEQUENTIAL, +NATURAL 
(15) The teacher said o.k. and finished the lesson. –
SEQUENTIAL, +CONSEQUENTIAL, -NATURAL 
If I have to show which role the elements of the environ-
ment play for the construction of a template, I want to ana-
lyse (12) in terms of a pragmatic template:  
PRAGMATIC TEMPLATE FOR “HE ROBBED THE BANK AND HE 
WAS SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS OF PRISON.”  
Form of utterance:  
 
Morpho-syntactic form of S {S1 and S2.} 
S1: NP VP (V NP).  
S2: NP VP (Vpass. PrepP) 
Encyclopaedic knowledge concerning S1: 
Robbing a bank is a criminal act.  
Lexical meaning of ‘to rob’ {deprive sb. of his property}.  
Encyclopaedic knowledge concerning S2: 
A court of law is entitled to sentence persons to pay a 
fine or to jail. 
Lexical meaning of ‘to sentence’ {state that sb. is to have

Stereotypical properties of the reported situation:  
Robbing a bank is a criminal act and the thief risks of be-
ing arrested by the police. If he is, he will be brought to 
justice. The court may impose a penalty if proven guilty. 
In a serious offense, the penalty is a multi-year prison 
sentence. 
From these elements of the pragmatic template follows 
that we understand (12) in terms of:  
(12 a) He robbed a bank and then, consequently, on 
the basis of a legal system he was sentenced to five 
years of prison.  
The decisive point of the idea of a pragmatic template is 
that it represents knowledge chunks that are used in order 
to interpret the utterance correctly without being part of this 
utterance, i.e. without being said or conveyed or otherwise 
transmitted. The encyclopedic facts as well as the items of 
the stereotypical situation are already known independ-
ently of the utterance, they are standing resources which 
we can activate if we are faced with an utterance like (12), 
and they combine with each other in the moment of proc-
essing. Speakers on the other hand calculate with this 
knowledge of the addressee(s), they presuppose it (per-
haps because it is analogous to their own knowledge) and 
choose their words according to these assumptions.  
Doubts may arise whether the said criteria and their 
combinations are really exhaustive. In this perspective my 
proposal is rather tentative, showing some important, if not 
all possibilities of criteria and their combinations. But I 
claim that these six criteria are basic for an analysis of the 
different types of conjunction with respect to their pragmat-
ics. The central concern of the contribution is that items 
like then, consequently etc. are not unarticulated constitu-
ents which have to be adjoined to the articulated part of 
the utterance, even if we understand the conjunction in this 
sense. In other terms, what is expressed by an utterance is 
very akin to what is articulated. The additional information 
is gained through the situational context or our world 
knowledge, and my claim is that a systematic account of 
this connection of utterance type and situation type is pos-
sible along the lines of pragmatic templates.

Fitting, Feeling and What Hegel Meant 
Jakub Mácha 
Brno, Czech Republic | macha@mail.muni.cz 
Abstract 
Two objects fit together if they have a compatible shape. I want to focus on a different kind of fitting which is predominant in 
Wittgenstein’s latest texts. This is a fitting underlined by a feeling of aesthetic comfort. One may even feel that all things fit 
together. Wittgenstein ascribed this expression of the unity of experience to Hegel. I argue for two claims: (1) Wittgenstein might 
have been inspired by the Neo-hegelian philosophy of Francis Bradley and his account of a feeling base. (2) Wittgenstein 
ascribed to Hegel the idea that objects are what they are only in their familiar surroundings. Hegel indeed claimed something 
like this—most notably in the “Sense-Certainty” chapter of the Phenomenology of Spirit. I provide a Wittgensteinian reading of 
this chapter concluding that every demonstrative act occurs against a background of demonstrative practices and that the 
doctrine of external relations is an inadequate account of knowledge. 
 
 
When can we say that two things fit together? Various 
things may seem to fit together: two pieces of a jigsaw 
puzzle or a piston and a cylinder or a hand in glove. They 
do fit, however, only if they share—at least partly—the 
same shape. This is to understand that a single description 
must hold true for both fitting objects—or at least for some 
of their parts. Fitting objects are thus internally related. Fit-
ting is also conditioned by an internal relation between two 
shapes: Two objects fit together if their shapes are inter-
nally related. 
In this paper, I want to focus on a different kind of fitting 
which is predominant in Wittgenstein’s latest texts. Let us 
call it tentatively fitting underlined—or rather conditioned—
by a certain experience, by a feeling. As Wittgenstein 
states in the Philosophical Investigations (PI II, p. 212), in 
the case of aspect seeing, one perceives an internal rela-
tion owing to the experience of a change of the aspect. But 
in which sense is this “owing to”? 
In Wittgenstein’s later remarks on the philosophy of psy-
chology, the expression “to fit” is intended as a substitute 
for the concept of psychological association (cf., e.g., RPP 
I §337). Psychological association should be understood 
causally and thus as externally; fitting, by contrast, should 
be understood formally and thus as internally. Wittgenstein 
shows that two phenomena can fit together in numerous 
examples. The name Schubert fits to Schubert’s works (PI, 
p. 215), Beethoven’s face fits to his Ninth symphony (RPP 
I, §338), the word ‘Goethe’ fits to its atmosphere and to the 
color yellow (MS 131, p. 149), my long familiar furniture fits 
into my room (RPP I, §339) or two motives fit necessarily 
together in a musical composition, two figures fit naturally 
together in a poem (CV, p. 65; MS 134, p. 78). Now, the 
gist of these examples is that these connections are not 
psychological associations, despite the fact that psycho-
logical associations and other causal connections might 
occur here as well (LWPP I, §76). These objects or phe-
nomena do not need to fit together as long as they are 
conceived as isolated objects. They are rather phenomena 
that fit into the whole of our experience: “That is how this 
piece fits into the world of our thoughts & feelings.” (CV, p. 
65; MS 134, p. 78) If two things fit together and, hence, are 
internally connected, then they make up a whole (RPP I, 
§341). Let me illustrate this kind of feeling by using a 
longer remark: 
Look at a long familiar piece of furniture in its old place 
in your room. You would like to say: “It is part of an or-
ganism.” Or “Take it outside, and it’s no longer at all the 
same as it was”, and similar things. And naturally one 
isn’t thinking of any causal dependence of one part on 
the rest. Rather it’s like this: I could give this thing a 
name and say that it is shifted from its place, has a 
stain, is dusty; but if I tried taking it quite out of its pre-
sent context, I should say that it had ceased to exist 
and another had got into its place. 
One might even feel like this: “Everything is part and 
parcel of everything else” (internal and external rela-
tions). Displace a piece and it is no longer what it was. 
Only in this surrounding is this table this table. Every-
thing is part of everything. [I believe Hegel meant some-
thing like this.] Here we have the inseparable atmos-
phere. And what is anyone saying, who says this? What 
sort of method of representation is he proposing? Isn’t it 
that of the painted picture? If, for example, the table has 
moved, you paint a new picture of the table with its sur-
rounding.
1 
Wittgenstein describes a typical experience: One is used 
to a certain arrangement of everyday objects, e.g., to an 
arrangement of furniture in one’s own room. The furniture 
may be arranged completely randomly without any aes-
thetical consideration. It may be done by someone else 
without taking into account any feeling of the occupant of 
the room. It does not matter whether the pieces of furniture 
fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. These objects do 
not need to share any shape at all. It turns out that the fit-
ting of two shapes is a special case of a more general felt 
fitting. 
In the second part of the remark, Wittgenstein presents 
two interconnected ideas, at least in my reading: (i) We 
might have a feeling of the unity of our experience which 
can be expressed as “Everything is part and parcel of eve-
rything else.” (ii) Objects as phenomena are what they are 
only within the world of our feelings, i.e., in the (felt) rela-
tions to other objects. Focusing on the first idea, we may 
notice a certain resemblance to the notion of ‘feeling’ or 
‘feeling base’ in Francis Bradley—a notable Neo-hegelian 
and an idealist of Wittgenstein’s youth.
2 A feeling that is 
given in immediate experience is—or at least can be—for 
Bradley so rich that it can give us a sense of its identity 
with the whole or the Absolute (cf. Ferreira, 1999, pp. 10, 
86 & passim). A feeling can transcend immediate experi-
ence towards the Absolute. In Bradley’s words: 
                                                      
1 RPP I, §339. The parenthesis in square brackets occurs only in an earlier 
manuscript MS 131, p. 154. 
2 We do not know whether Wittgenstein read anything by Bradley. He may 
have known the main traits of Bradley’s philosophy from Russell’s writings. 
And like Russell, Wittgenstein might have confused Bradley’s views, loosely 
inspired by Hegel, with Hegel’s own views.

[Immediate experience] is a positive non-relational non-
objective whole of feeling. Within my immediate experi-
ence falls everything of which in any sense I am aware, 
so far at least as I am aware of it. (Bradley 1914, p. 
189) 
This claim has to be understood in the context of Bradley’s 
theory of judgment. If one judges about one’s immediate 
experience (e.g., “This is my table”), one has to focus on a 
certain part of reality. Relations to other parts of reality en-
ter into this judgment as well (The table is what it is only at 
its familiar place, in its surroundings). Although we can try 
to abstract all relations out of this judgment, “feeling [still] 
remains after relations have been abstracted out of it.” 
(Ferreira 1999, p. 120) Feeling is in this sense a feeling 
base which cannot be abstracted, because it is non-
relational or even non-conceptual. The feeling base tran-
scends all experience. 
I do not claim that Wittgenstein was directly influenced 
by Bradley here. My point is rather that both thinkers per-
tain to the same kind of philosophical intuition. Can we 
say, accordingly, that Wittgenstein was an adherent of 
monism like Bradley? We have to look at Wittgenstein’s 
method of analysis. Wittgenstein’s aim was to differentiate, 
to show what, how and in which manner our experience is. 
In short, his aim was to analyze phenomena. This analysis 
may take into account our—rather indeterminate—feeling 
that everything is part and parcel of everything else. Witt-
genstein, however, introduces this kind of feeling with the 
preamble “One might even feel like this”. This is to under-
stand that people might have this feeling. One of the tasks 
of philosophical analysis is to qualify or restrict the claim 
that everything is part and parcel of everything else. The 
actual question is whether it is really the case that for 
every two single phenomena we might experience a feel-
ing that they fit together or that one is an aspect of the 
other. Wittgenstein’s reflections show that this is not the 
case: We cannot imagine certain combinations (mixtures) 
of colors;3 we feel aesthetic discomfort with certain combi-
nations of phenomena.
4 We have a feeling of unity, ulti-
mately turning out to be differentiated. Bradley would say 
that we experience differentiated reality which turns out to 
be ultimately a unity. 
 
Wittgenstein ascribes to Hegel the idea that objects are 
what they are only in their familiar surroundings. I do not 
want to overemphasize this casual remark. Here is my 
brief suggestion what Wittgenstein might have referred to 
in Hegel. In the “Sense-Certainty” chapter of the Phe-
nomenology of the Spirit, Hegel provides a complicated 
argument that every demonstrative act to our immediate 
experience, every ‘This’ is always mediated by a universal. 
When we try to point out to a single thing, we realize that: 
The Here pointed out, to which I hold fast, is similarly a 
this Here which, in fact is not this Here, but a Before 
and Behind, an Above and Below, a Right and Left. The 
Above is itself similarly this manifold otherness of 
above, below, etc. (Hegel 1968, p. 64) 
Consider an object that we want to point out as ‘Here’ or 
‘This’. We can refer to this object as the object before 
something else, above something else, left to something 
else etc. Every ostensive “This” means “this I am pointing 
at” or “this before me” etc. Every demonstrative act to an 
                                                      
3 Cf., e.g., Z §346: ‘“There is no such thing as a reddish green” is akin to the 
sentences that we use as axioms in mathematics.’ 
4 Cf. LS §654: “If I see it this way, it fits this, but not that.” 
object is, hence, dependent by the object’s relations to 
other objects one may point at. In Wittgenstein’s terms: 
Every demonstrative act occurs within and against a back-
ground of demonstrative practices.
5 Without this back-
ground knowledge, ostensive pointing would be impossi-
ble. What appears at the outset to be the most immediate 
and certain knowledge (“the richest kind of knowledge” in 
Hegel’s wording) proves to be, in fact, a very low (“the 
most abstract and poorest”) kind of knowledge. Knowledge 
is, hence, mediated by universality, by our shared (and 
thus universal) practices. 
What has, then, the status of the most certain and im-
mediate knowledge in this setting if it is not a single intui-
tion? Hegel, in adopting his characteristic synthetic stance, 
says that if something on the sense-certainty is its most 
immediate knowledge, it is the sense-certainty as a whole: 
Thus it is only sense-certainty as a whole which stands 
firm within itself as immediacy and by so doing ex-
cludes from itself all the opposition which has hitherto 
obtained.
 (Hegel 1968, p. 62) 
If one strives (as Hegel does, but Wittgenstein does not) 
for the most adequate knowledge (of an object), he has to 
take into account all other objects and relations to them. 
Wittgenstein says that if one takes an object in isolation, 
one may have a feeling that the object “is part and parcel 
of everything else,” that it fits in our experience. For Hegel, 
such an object (when taken in isolation) will be incomplete 
and will stimulate a feeling of desire.
6 
There is a neat summary of the “Sense-Certainty” chap-
ter by Philip Kain: “Sense-certainty is as opposed to a doc-
trine of internal relations as anything can be.” (Kain 2005, 
p. 27) Sense-certainty is an account of knowledge that is 
founded on singe intuitions, single demonstrative acts, 
single objects as its most certain and immediate elements. 
It is the utmost pluralistic and atomistic account of knowl-
edge. Sense-certainty is equivalent to the doctrine of ex-
ternal relations, i.e. to the view that all relations are exter-
nal. 
The argument of the “Sense-Certainty” chapter is merely 
that the doctrine of external relations is an inadequate ac-
count of knowledge. Wittgenstein gives virtually the same 
argument against the doctrine of external relations as 
Hegel does. “Sense-Certainty” is, however, only the first 
chapter of the Phenomenology, and yet Hegel has to bring 
many more arguments in order to establish the doctrine of 
internal relations. Wittgenstein does not follow Hegel in this 
respect.

5 Here is a ‘Wittgensteinian’ summary of the “Sense-Certainty” chapter by 
Willem deVries (2008, p. 74): “Hegel’s argument brings to the fore the fact that 
there are no lone isolated demonstrative acts, and therefore no lone isolated 
intuitions. Every demonstration, and therefore every intuition, is the determi-
nate act it is because it occurs within and against a background of demonstra-
tive practices that license and indeed ultimately demand the normative as-
sessment of the individual demonstrative acts.” 
6 Cf. Kain 2005, p. 45: “If the doctrine of internal relations is correct and the 
reality of things involves the totality of their relations—the absolute—then to 
cut things off from the absolute will create in them an absence or lack, which in 
those things with consciousness will stimulate desire.” 
7 Cf. Taylor 1975, p. 143 for a statement of an explicit similarity between 
Hegel’s and Wittgenstein’s arguments.

Ist „Familienähnlichkeit“ ein philosophischer, ein theoretischer 
Begriff oder beides? 
Ingolf Max 
Leipzig, Deutschland | max@uni-leipzig.de  
Abstract 
Unter Verweis auf die Analogie zwischen Wittgensteins Begriff „Familienähnlichkeit“ und Wagners „Tristan-Akkord“ wird auf die 
kompositorische Leistung beider verwiesen, Muster mit einer spezifischen inneren Struktur in ihren Werken in internen, 
harmonischen Zusammenhängen zu verarbeiten. Im theoretischen Sinne könnten wir die Ähnlichkeitsbeziehungen zwischen 
der Gliedern innerhalb einer Familie von denen zwischen den Gliedern verschiedener Familien unterscheiden. Mit 
„Familienähnlichkeit“ wird der Verweis auf externe Ähnlichkeiten ausgeschlossen. Wittgenstein verwendet seinen Begriff 
konsequent philosophisch, da er nur dort zur Anwendung kommt, wo wir uns aus der Sprache heraus auf die GESAMTE 
Sprache beziehen. Hier haben wir keine Wahl zwischen interner und externer Betrachtungsweise. Es können Theorien (z.B. 
eine Logik der Akkorde) gebildet werden, die ausschließlich interne (harmonische) Verwandtschaften betrachten. Diese haben 
jedoch immer eine begrenzte Reichweite und liefern keinen Zugriff auf das GESAMTE Phänomen. An Hand der Kreation einer 
Folge von Akkordmustern wird gezeigt, wie sich Momente eines theoretischen Begriffs „Familienähnlichkeit“ darstellen lassen. 
 
 
1. „Familienähnlichkeit“ und  
„Tristan-Akkord“ 
Es scheint zunächst höchst erstaunlich, dass der Begriff 
„Familienähnlichkeit“ durch Wittgenstein eine enorme Be-
rühmtheit erlangt hat, obgleich er in den Philosophischen 
Untersuchungen nur ein einziges Mal und zudem in Anfüh-
rungszeichen auftritt: 
Ich kann diese Ähnlichkeiten nicht besser charakterisie-
ren als durch das Wort »Familienähnlichkeiten«; denn 
so übergreifen und kreuzen sich die verschiedenen 
Ähnlichkeiten, die zwischen den Gliedern einer Familie 
bestehen: Wuchs, Gesichtszüge, Augenfarbe, Gang, 
Temperament, etc. etc. -- Und ich werde sagen: die 
›Spiele‹ bilden eine Familie. (PU 67) 
Auch Richard Wagner wird mit einem Akkordmuster in 
Verbindung gebracht, welches nach einem Akteur seiner 
Oper „Tristan und Isolde“ benannt worden ist: „Tristan-
Akkord“. Einen Akkord zeichnen zwei unterschiedene Be-
züge aus: Einmal seine innere Struktur, die neben den Tö-
nen vor allem die damit zugleich gegebenen Intervalllän-
gen – d.h., die Abstände zwischen allen Tonpaaren – in 
einer eindeutig festgelegten Anordnung (in einem Akkord-
muster) umfasst. In dieser Hinsicht ist der Tristan-Akkord 
eine Innovation, die sich allerdings bereits bei Salieri, 
Haydn und Beethoven findet. Zum anderen sind Akkorde 
in einem Musikstück, in einer einfachen Kadenz, ja schon 
bei einem Bezug auf einen einzigen weiteren Akkord, in 
einen Harmoniekontext eingebettet. Wenn dieser Kontext 
auf das Zusammenspiel zwischen den inneren Formen der 
Akkorde begrenzt wird, werden alle harmonischen Bezüge 
zu internen Bezügen. Ein Komponist kann in beiden Hin-
sichten kreativ werden: Er kann beliebige Akkordmuster in 
neue Bezüge zu anderen Akkordmustern bringen (internes 
Komponieren) und er kann neue Akkordmuster erfinden 
(inneres Komponieren). Da diese beiden Momente weder 
im Schaffensprozess noch im Darstellungsprozess klar 
getrennt sind, kommt es bei der Beschreibung dieser In-
teraktion immer wieder zu begrifflichen Schwierigkeiten. 
In Hinsicht auf sprachliche Kompositionen befand sich 
Wittgenstein in einem gewissen Sinne in einer ähnlichen 
Lage wie Wagner. Im Tractatus logico-philosophicus hatte 
er zunächst versucht, die logische Form ausgehend von 
Elementarsätzen zu beschreiben, wobei diese Verkettun-
gen von echten logischen Atomen – Namen – sind. Ele-
mentarsätze sind logisch immer miteinander verträglich, 
d.h. ihr logisches Produkt ist niemals inkonsistent. Witt-
genstein war jedoch in seiner mittleren Phase (ca. 1929 
bis 1931) davon überzeugt, dass die logische Form von 
Sätzen, die Farbausdrücke enthalten, elementar sein 
müssen und sich dennoch in bestimmten Fällen aus-
schließen: Wir fühlen, dass die beiden Sätze „Diese Stelle 
des Gesichtsfeldes ist rot.“ und „Diese Stelle des Gesichts-
feldes ist blau.“ nicht miteinander verträglich sind. Auf eine 
ähnliche Weise sind auch bestimmte Akkorde mit Blick auf 
spezifische harmonische Anforderungen nicht kompatibel: 
„Dieser Akkord ist eine Subdominante.“ und „Dieser Ak-
kord ist eine Dominante.“ Beide Sätze können zutreffen, 
aber eben nicht in demselben harmonischen Kontext. Der 
Grund dieser Unverträglichkeit liegt in einem Konflikt zwi-
schen innerer logischer Form der Farbsätze bzw. Akkord-
muster und der internen/(farb-)harmonischen Beziehung 
auf einen weiteren Farbsatz bzw. Akkord. Wittgenstein 
suchte zunächst eine neue Logik strukturierter Elementar-
ausdrücke analog z.B. zu Akkorden, wobei die innere 
Struktur über eine mathematische Form auf Skalen, Koor-
dinatensysteme o.ä. bezogen ist. Die logische Form im 
Tractatus musste Raum für überhaupt alle möglichen For-
men bieten und durfte daher keinen Einschränkungen un-
terworfen sein. Jede Einschränkung der logischen Form 
führt jedoch schnell von einem rein formalen Kalkül zu ei-
ner empirischen Theorie. Letztere war jedoch nicht das 
Ziel von Wittgensteins Philosophieren. Er benötigt eine 
Begrifflichkeit, die es erlaubt, die harmonischen Beziehun-
gen im Einzelfall zu beschreiben, die interne logische Form 
aufzuzeigen, ohne spezifische Strukturannahmen treffen 
zu müssen bzw. ohne im Sinne der traditionellen Philoso-
phie auf das Gemeinsame aller Dinge – das Wesen – bzw. 
im Sinne der empirischen Wissenschaften auf Invarianten 
(Universalien, Naturkonstanten) zurückgreifen zu müssen. 
Hier kommt der Begriff „Familienähnlichkeit“ ins Spiel. Die 
„große Frage, die hinter allen diesen Betrachtungen steht“, 
lautet: 
»Du machst dir's leicht! Du redest von allen möglichen 
Sprachspielen, hast aber nirgends gesagt, was denn 
das Wesentliche des Sprachspiels, und also der Spra-
che, ist. Was allen diesen Vorgängen gemeinsam ist 
und sie zur Sprache, oder zu Teilen der Sprache macht. 
Du schenkst dir also gerade den Teil der Untersuchung, 
der dir selbst seinerzeit das meiste Kopfzerbrechen

gemacht hat, nämlich den, die allgemeine Form des 
Satzes und der Sprache betreffend.« (PU 65) 
M.E. zeigt Wittgenstein mittels „seinerzeit“ an, dass „Fami-
lienähnlichkeit“ die Alternative zur logischen Form im 
Tractatus als auch den Bemühungen zwischen 1929 und 
1931 darstellt. Nicht etwas Gemeinsames wird in den 
sprachlichen Erscheinungen gesucht, sondern dass sie 
„miteinander in vielen verschiedenen Weisen verwandt“ 
sind (PU 66). 
Im Vergleich zur Erfindung des Tristan-Akkords scheint 
die innere kompositorische Leistung Wittgensteins relativ 
gering zu sein. Wittgenstein schuf aus „Familie“ und „Ähn-
lichkeit“ das Kompositum „Familienähnlichkeit“. Interessan-
terweise stellen auch andere bekannte Begriffe der Philo-
sophischen Untersuchungen, Teil I Komposita dar, wobei 
einige davon ebenfalls nur ein einziges Vorkommen im 
Text haben, selten oder aber auch recht häufig auftreten: 
„Weltanschauung“ (nur in PU 122), „Zwischenglied“ (eben-
falls nur in PU 122), „Lebensform“ (PU 19, 23, 241) – da-
gegen „Sprachspiel“ (81 Vorkommen). Bereits über die 
beiden Wortformen „Familie-“ (10 Vorkommen) und „ähn-
lich-“ (75 Vorkommen) ist das Kompositum „Familienähn-
lichkeit“ mit vielen anderen Paragraphen geschickt verlinkt. 
Und ähnlich wie bei Wagners Verwendung des Tristan-
Akkords ist das einzige Vorkommen von „Familienähnlich-
keit“ dramaturgisch durch seine vielfältigen harmonischen 
Verknüpfungen im Text der Philosophischen Untersu-
chungen selbst verankert. Neben dem Marker „die „große 
Frage, die hinter allen diesen Betrachtungen steht“, finden 
sich in PU 67 die Verknüpfungen zu solchen Begriffen wie 
„direkte Verwandtschaft“, „indirekte Verwandtschaft“, die 
wunderbaren Metaphern „denn so übergreifen und kreu-
zen sich die verschiedenen Ähnlichkeiten, die zwischen 
den Gliedern einer Familie bestehen“, „wie wir beim Spin-
nen eines Fadens Faser an Faser drehen“ sowie „Und die 
Stärke des Fadens liegt nicht darin, daß irgend eine Faser 
durch seine ganze Länge läuft, sondern darin, daß viele 
Fasern einander übergreifen.“ Eine theoretische Fassung 
des „Übergreifens von Ähnlichkeiten bzw. Fasern“ stellt auf 
jeden Fall eine höchst anspruchsvolle Herausforderung 
dar. 
2. Theoretische vs. philosophische Ver-
wendung des Begriffs „Familienähnlich-
keit“ 
Wittgenstein verwendet den Begriff zumindest bereits am 
19.8.1931 im Manuskript 111 auf Seite 119: 
So könnte Spengler besser verstanden werden wenn er 
sagte: ich vergleiche verschiedene Kulturperioden dem 
Leben von Familien; innerhalb der Familie gibt es eine 
Familienähnlichkeit, während es auch zwischen Mitglie-
dern verschiedener Familien eine Ähnlichkeit gibt; die 
Familienähnlichkeit unterscheidet sich von der andern 
Ähnlichkeit so & so etc.“ (auch in ÜG 469) 
Neben der frühen Verwendung des Begriffs lässt sich fest-
halten, dass Wittgenstein diesen für eine rein interne Be-
stimmung von Ähnlichkeiten reserviert: „innerhalb der Fa-
milie“. Daneben akzeptiert Wittgenstein für Spengler und 
damit vielleicht auch allgemein für ein theoretisches Vor-
gehen eine „andere Ähnlichkeit“, die „zwischen Mitgliedern 
verschiedener Familien“ besteht. Diese Ähnlichkeit ist mit 
Blick auf jede dieser verschiedenen Familien extern. Die 
Unterscheidung zwischen interner und externer Ähnlichkeit 
ist bezogen auf die betrachtete Einheit (Familie, Spiel, 
Sprachspiel) natürlich relativ. Wir können die Familienähn-
lichkeit von Brettspielen betrachten, dann können wir in 
dieser Hinsicht nichts über die Ähnlichkeit zwischen Brett-
spielen und Kartenspielen (ohne Brett) sagen. Wittgens-
tein führt in PU 66 wunderbar vor wie wir dann über die 
Ballspiele zu scheinbar allgemeineren Familien der ›unter-
haltenden‹ Spiele bzw. der Gewinnspiele übergehen. Aber 
die große Frage war doch die Familienähnlichkeit ALLER 
Spiele und – dazu analog – DER Sprache zu erfahren. 
Und diese philosophische Frage ist wiederum analog zur 
Frage nach der Welt als „alles, was der Fall ist“ (T1). Witt-
genstein hatte dort scheinbar mit der Angabe der allge-
meinen Satzform (T6) geantwortet.  
Solange wir andere Sprachspiele finden können, solan-
ge wir eine Theorie konstruieren, die ihre Kontextfreiheit 
dadurch rechtfertigt, dass sie ihre Reichweite angeben 
kann, können wir philosophische Reflexionen vermeiden. 
Wir können sagen, dass die Theorie der Brettspiele eben 
KEINE Theorie der Kartenspiele ist. Die Frage „Welche 
Geometrie hat das Brett auf dem Skat gespielt wird?“ ist 
unsinnig im Rahmen einer Theorie der Brettspiele, solange 
ich den Begriff „Skat“ in dieser Theorie nicht bilden kann. 
Und die Frage „Gewinnt Vorhand mit den obersten beiden 
Buben, Eichel As, Eichel Zehn, Grün As, Grün Zehn und 4 
Luschen einen Grand Hand immer?“ scheint keine sinnvol-
le Frage einer Brettspieltheorie zu sein, wohl aber der 
Skattheorie.  
Wittgenstein geht es um Sprachspiele (Plural) nur me-
thodisch bzw. philosophiekritisch. Die „große Frage“ be-
zieht sich auf die allgemeine Form DES Sprachspiels (Sin-
gular!). Zu diesem Sprachspiel können wir kein benachbar-
tes, kein übergreifendes Sprachspiel angeben. Die Speng-
ler empfohlene „andere Ähnlichkeit“ „zwischen Mitgliedern 
verschiedener Familien“ bzw. zwischen Elementen unter-
schiedener Sprachspiele steht nicht mehr zur Verfügung. 
Der Philosoph kann im Unterschied zum Theoretiker nicht 
extern arbeiten, er hat keinen äußeren Kontext, auf den er 
sich berufen kann:  
Ich werde auch das Ganze: der Sprache und der Tätig-
keiten, mit denen sie verwoben ist, das »Sprachspiel« 
nennen. (PU 7) 
Der Satz 1.1 des Tractatus „Die Welt ist die Gesamtheit 
der Tatsachen, nicht der Dinge.“ lässt sich umformulieren 
in „Die Sprache ist die Gesamtheit der familienähnlichen 
Sprachspiele, nicht der Worte (Sprachspielfiguren)“. Aller-
dings sind Worte eben keine Atome wie Dinge. Worte sind 
eher wie Akkorde im harmonischen Raum und als solche 
zudem mit Handlungen und Gesten verknüpft. 
3. Zum theoretischen Umgang mit Fami-
lienähnlichkeit: Eine Logik der Akkorde 
Wir müssen Wittgenstein in seinem philosophischen Pro-
gramm nicht folgen und können das rein interne Verständ-
nis von Ähnlichkeit auf klar separierte Teilbereiche in ei-
nem theoretischen (formal-logischen oder auch empiri-
schen) Programm realisieren. Wittgenstein spricht selbst 
von „primitiven Sprachspielen“. Im Zusammenhang mit 
dem Sprachspiel aus PU 2 vermerkt er: „Fasse dies als 
vollständige primitive Sprache auf.“ Um ein internes Ver-
ständnis von Ähnlichkeit zu entwickeln, muss der Untersu-
chungsgegenstand vollständig und damit in einem gewis-
sen Sinne abgeschlossen sein. Dabei ist „vollständig“ 
kompatibel mit „unendlich“, wenn wir ein Verfahren für die 
Bestimmung dieser Unendlichkeit haben. Und „abge-
schlossen“ schließt keinesfalls die Berücksichtigung exter-
ner Vergleiche mit anderen, ja sogar umfassenderen 
Sprachspielen aus.

Eine Logik der Akkorde, die sich allein auf die ganzzah-
lige, beidseitig offene Skala der chromatischen Tonleiter 
und auf invariante Akkordmuster bezieht, stellt mit Blick 
auf die Vielfalt harmonischer Phänomene ein solches voll-
ständiges Sprachspiel dar. Es lassen sich viele Arten von 
Operatoren, die aus Akkorden wieder Akkorde bilden, ex-
akt charakterisieren. Die Logik der Akkorde erfasst nur 
diejenigen harmonischen Beziehungen, die intern in der 
Musik bereits kodiert sind, ohne dabei weitere externe 
Faktoren zu berücksichtigen. Die Frage ist offen, wie groß 
die Reichweite einer solchen Theorie mit Blick auf die Be-
schreibung harmonischer Zusammenhänge ist bzw. wel-
che Erweiterungen dieser Theorie notwendig werden um 
ein neue Theorie mit größerer Reichweite zu erhalten.  
Akkorde sind logisch grundlegend, weil sie sich durch 
zwei oder mehr unmittelbar aufeinander bezogene Basis-
intervalle (Intervalle unmittelbar benachbarter Töne des 
Akkords) kontextfrei charakterisieren lassen. 
Übliche Benennungen von Tönen der chromatischen 
Tonleiter erfassen wir arithmetisch mit der Form ݐ௬, wobei 
ݕ irgendeine ganze Zahl, die den Oktavbereich des Tones 
angibt, ist und ݐ௬= ݐ+ (ݕ× 12). Jeder Ton wird damit 
letztlich durch eine ganze Zahl dargestellt: 3ଵ= 3 +
(1 × 12) = 15, 3ିଵ= 3 + (−1 × 12) = −9. Variablen für 
Tonnamen sind ݔଵ, ݔଶ, … Eine Beispielliste für die Entspre-
chungen zwischen einigen arithmetischen und den korres-

Zwei beliebige Töne der chromatischen Tonleiter bilden 
ein Intervall. Die Intervalllänge ist der chromatische 
(natürlichzahlige) Abstand zwischen einem höheren Ton 
ݔଶ und einem tieferen Ton ݔଵ: Die Länge des Intervalls 
[ݔଶ−ݔଵ] beträgt ݔଶ−ݔଵ. Die Intervalllänge hat damit im-
mer einen positiven Wert. Intervalllängen können ganz 
unabhängig von den sie realisierenden Tönen betrachtet 
werden. Wenn wir sagen, die Intervalllänge ist eine kleine 
Terz, dann kennen wir zwar die Intervalllänge, nicht aber 
die Töne, die sie realisieren.

Illustration: Die Darstellung einer primitiv familienähn-
lichen Kadenz (vgl. auch Max 2010 & 2012) 
Mit Bezug auf die Tonhöhen ist kein „Übergreifen“ bzw. 
"Kreuzen" von Ähnlichkeiten zu erreichen. Um diese Me-
tapher zu visualisieren, müssen wir uns auf die Intervall-
längen (nicht auf die Intervalle!) beziehen. Minimalanforde-
rungen an eine Familienähnlichkeit von Akkorden sind: 
 Es gibt Fasern bzgl. invarianter Intervalllängen, die 
mindestens zwei Akkorde miteinander verbinden. 
 Nicht alle derartigen Fasern laufen durch die gesamte 
Kadenz. Selbst wenn es eine solche Faser gäbe, dann 
wäre sie zwar wesentlich für diese Kadenz, aber immer 
noch längst nicht das Wesen aller Kadenzen. 
 Der Faden der Kadenz zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass 
sich mehrere Fasern kreuzen bzw. berühren.  
Hier ist die Kreation einer Kadenz mit mehrfachem 
Kreuzen von Fasern mit jeweils gleicher Intervalllänge:

Wir erkennen in dieser Struktur folgende Fasertypen: 
Fasern bezogen auf die Basisintervalle: 
 +5଴-Faser von Akkord 1 bis 3 
 +4଴-Faser von Akkord 1 bis 2 
 +8଴-Faser von Akkord 2 bis 4 
 +7଴-Faser von Akkord 3 bis 4 
Wir sehen, dass es zum Übergreifen der Intervalllängenfa-
sern kommt, die sich im Kreuzen von Fasern zeigt: 
 Zwischen Akkord 1 und 2 kreuzen sich die +4଴-Faser 
und die +5଴-Faser. 
 Zwischen Akkord 2 und 3 kreuzen sich die +8଴-Faser 
und die +5଴-Faser. 
 Zwischen Akkord 3 und 4 kreuzen sich die +8଴-Faser 
und die +7଴-Faser. 
 Zwischen Akkord 4 und 1 gibt es keine gemeinsamen 
Basisintervalle, obwohl beide Akkorde C-Dur-Akkorde 
sind! 
Wir betrachten nun die Faserbildung, indem wir auch die 
Binnenintervalle und das Bezugsintervall berücksichtigen: 
 Die +8଴-Faser (kleine Sexte ist Binnenintervall im 1. 
Akkord) verbindet nunmehr alle 4 Akkorde miteinander 
und könnte somit als ein Wesensmerkmal dieser 
Sequenz gelten. Sie taugt jedoch ganz sicher nicht zum 
Wesensmerkmal von Kadenzen im Allgemeinen. 
 Die +0ଵ-Faser (C-Oktave) verbindet die Akkorde 1 bis 3: 
Sie ist Bezugsintervall des 1. Akkords sowie jeweils 
eines der beiden Binnenintervalle im 2. und 3. Akkord. 
 Die +7଴-Faser würde bei einem Rückbezug auf den 1. 
Akkord auch diesen vernetzen. 
Wir erhalten nun noch folgende zusätzliche Kreuzungen 
bzw. „Berührungen“: 
 Die +0ଵ-Faser zwischen dem 1. und 2. Akkord berührt 
die +5଴-Faser. Außerdem verläuft sie überlagerungsfrei 
zur +4଴-Faser. 
 Die +0ଵ-Faser zwischen dem 2. und 3. Akkord kreuzt 
partiell die +5଴-Faser und die +8଴-Faser. 
 Die +8଴-Faser zwischen dem 1. und 2. Akkord berührt 
die +5଴-Faser. 
4. Ausblick 
Wittgenstein hätte gegen eine solche Analyse sicher eine 
ganze Reihe von Einwänden vorzubringen. Aus der Sicht 
einer auf die gesamte Musik bezogenen Familienähnlich-
keit würde diese theoretisch angelegte Analyse selektiv 
nur zwei Kriterien von Akkorden berücksichtigen: (1) die 
Höhe der einzelnen Töne relativ zu einer logischen Skala 
(der ganzzahlig dargestellten chromatischen Tonleiter) und 

Ist „Familienähnlichkeit“ ein philosophischer, ein theoretischer Begriff oder beides? | Ingolf Max 
 
 
 
187
(2) die Intervallabstände zwischen den Tönen eines Ak-
kords relativ zu derselben Skala. Wirkliche Akkorde unter-
scheiden sich noch in vielen anderen Hinsichten vonein-
ander: (a) Tonlänge, (b) Rhythmus, (c) Klangfarbe der Tö-
ne, (d) die Anzahl der beteiligten Stimmen (Instrumente), 
(e) die mögliche Präsentation der Akkorde als gebrochene 
etc. etc.  
Unsere eingangs gestellte Frage lässt sich also auf recht 
unterschiedliche Weise beantworten: Wittgenstein hat den 
Begriff „Familienähnlichkeit“ vor allem aus philosophiekriti-
schen Erwägungen heraus komponiert. Er war überzeugt, 
dass die Übertragung theoretischer Methoden auf die Phi-
losophie die Illusion nährt, dass – wie im Falle Spenglers – 
die philosophische Frage nach dem Wesen der Sprache 
durch externe Ähnlichkeiten, durch die Bezugnahme auf 
Außersprachliches beantwortet werden kann, was im Kon-
flikt zu der Unhintergehbarkeit der Sprache steht. 
Andererseits ist die theoretische Modellierung interner 
Ähnlichkeiten und Verwandtschaften durchaus möglich, 
wenn man sich nur bewusst ist, dass diese Vorgehenswei-
se, die Frage nach DER Sprache wie auch DER Musik und 
damit philosophische Fragen nicht beantworten kann. Wie 
die Sprache mit Tätigkeiten verwoben ist, so ist auch die 
Theoriebildung an gewisse Handlungen gebunden, z.B. an 
Entscheidungen über die Wahl des logischen Raumes 
(chromatische Tonleiter) und die Entscheidung über inva-
riante Basisstrukturen (Akkordmuster). Auf diese Weise 
können ALLE internen Verwandtschaften aufgezeigt wer-
den, aber auch NUR diese. Es bleibt eine theoretisch reiz-
volle Aufgabe die Ähnlichkeit innerhalb bestimmter 
Sprachspiele aufzuzeigen und dabei die metaphorischen 
Angaben Wittgensteins zur „Familienähnlichkeit“ zu kon-
kretisieren.

„Vanitas vanitatum“ – Ludwig Wittgenstein und Blaise Pascal als 
Kritiker der Eitelkeit 
Johannes Leopold Mayer 
Baden, Österreich | a-jl.mayer@aon.at 
Abstract 
Die Eitelkeit ist ein großes kontinuierliches Menschheitsdrama. Und jeder Mensch ist Mitwirkender. Es sollte zu denken geben, 
dass Blaise Pascal und Ludwig Wittgenstein sich diesem nachdrücklich angenommen haben und auch auf diese Weise diese 
Kontinuität bestätigen. Sie spüren ihre eigene aktuelle Eitelkeit auf und geben uns damit ein Mittel in die Hand, bei uns das Sel-
be zu tun. 
 
 
„Beschmutze alles mit meiner Eitelkeit“ (Wittgenstein 2000,  
S 47). Punktgenau trifft Ludwig Wittgenstein mit dieser Ta-
gebucheintragung sich selbst. Nicht weniger dramatisch 
kreist Blaise Pascal 300 Jahre früher das nämliche 
menschliche Geschwür ein: << La vanité est si ancrée 
dans le cœur de l’homme qu’un soldat, un goujat, un cui-
sonier, un crocheteur se vante et veut avoir ses admira-
teurs, et les philosophes mêmes en veulent, et ceux qui 
écrivent contre veulent avoir la gloire d’avoir bien écrit, et 
ceux qui les lisent veulent avoir la gloire de [les] avoir lus, 
et moi, qui écris ceci ai peut-être cette envie, et  peut-être 
ceux qui le liront >> (Pascal 2010, § 520). 
Gleichermaßen stehen der Franzose des 17. und der 
Österreicher des 20. Jahrhunderts als Beispiele dafür, wie 
sehr die Eitelkeit ein Dauerthema der Menschheitsge-
schichte ist und dass deren Auffindung bei einem selbst 
beginnt – auch durch vergleichende Bezugnahme auf un-
terscheidbare Erscheinungen des Menschlichen – unter-
scheidbar etwa durch die jeweilige berufliche Tätigkeit. Die 
Eitelkeit ist demnach ein Phänomen, welches in diversen 
Varianten der Gestalten und der Gestaltung des Menschli-
chen zum Ausdruck kommt – und der somit nichts 
Menschliches fremd ist. So trägt folgerichtig auch der 
Mensch als ein Tätiger in den Wissenschaften seinen er-
kennbaren Teil bei zur buntscheckigen Erscheinungsform 
der Eitelkeit. Ja, er gerade besonders, weil er mit seinen 
Überlegungen das Spiel der Katze, welche sich in ihren 
eigenen Schwanz beißen möchte soweit auf die Spitze zu 
treiben vermag, dass dadurch ein grelles Licht der Absur-
dität entzündet wird. 
Wittgenstein erweist sich als Meister einer solchen 
Übersteigerung, wenn er feststellt: „Wenn ich sage, ich 
möchte die Eitelkeit ablegen, so ist es fraglich, ob ich das 
nicht wiederum nur aus Eitelkeit heraus will. Ich bin eitel & 
soweit ich eitel bin, sind auch meine Besserungswünsche 
eitel. Ich möchte dann gern wie der & der sein der nicht 
eitel war & der mir gefällt & ich überlege schon im Geiste 
den Nutzen, den ich vom ‚Ablegen‘ der Eitelkeit haben 
würde“ (Wittgenstein 2000, S 64). 
Eine wesentliche Frage hinsichtlich der Eitelkeit ist aber 
auch jene: welche Qualität hat  mein Wissenwollen? Und 
wie ist demnach das Streben nach  Wissen und dem Um-
gang mit ihm zu bewerten? Für Pascal ist dies eine grund-
sätzliche Frage bezüglich jeder forscherischen Tätigkeit. 
Es ist eine solche nach dem Ausgangsimpuls für das Wis-
senwollen und Forschen. Ist dieser vielleicht bloße Neu-
gier, welche ausschließlich letztlich sinnloses Wissen um 
seiner selbst willen hervorzubringen imstande ist; ein 
fruchtloses Wissen, weil aus fruchtlosem Samen? Was ist 
nämlich diese Neugier anderes als Eitelkeit – dazu eine 
von gesteigerter Qualität! << Orgeuil. Curiosité n’est que 
vanité le plus souvent. On ne veut savoir que pour en par-
ler. Autrement on ne voyagerait pas sur la mer pour ne 
jamais en rien dire et pour la seul plaisir de voir, sans 
espérance d’en jamais communiquer >> (Pascal 2010, § 
112).  
Es ist durchaus nicht erstaunlich, dass Pascal, der nicht 
nur hinsichtlich der Philosophie, sondern ebenso als Ma-
thematiker und Theologe in die Wissenschaftsgeschichte 
und als Meister des Wortes in jene der Literatur eingegan-
gen ist, in seiner Einschätzung der Neugier als Impuls für 
fruchtloses Wissenwollen zu nahezu identischen Be-
schreibungen kommt wie 500 Jahre vor ihm Bernard de 
Clairvaux. Und dies unabhängig von seinen geistigen und 
familiären Beziehungen zur Cistercienserinnenabtei Port-
Royal-des-champs.  
Bernard, der vielleicht bedeutendste Denker des Cister-
cienserordens im 12. Jahrhundert  ist der wohlüberlegten 
Auffassung: „Scientia propter se: curiositas; ut ostentur: 
vanitas“ (Bernhard 1993, S 450). 
Jegliche Arbeit - demnach auch die denkerisch-
forschende – darf sich demnach nicht in sich selbst als 
ihrem eigenen Sinn und Ziel erschöpfen. Sinn und Ziel 
muss sie in etwas außer ihr finden, um Wert zu haben. Sie 
muss sich – so postuliert es Wittgenstein – selbst darbrin-
gen. „Wenn du nicht bereit bist, deine Arbeit für etwas 
noch höheres zu opfern, so wird kein Segen mit ihr sein. 
Denn ihre Höhe erhält sie, dadurch dass du sie in die wah-
re Höhenlage im Verhältnis zum Ideal stellst. Darum ver-
nichtet Eitelkeit den Wert der Arbeit“ (Wittgenstein 2000, S 
91). 
Nun kann spätestens hier massiver Einspruch angemel-
det werden. Beispielsweise mit dem Argument, dass der 
Wert der Gründung eines Spitals für Kranke dadurch kei-
neswegs vernichtet wird, wenn diese Gründung durch je-
manden sehr Wohlabenden erfolgt ist, der letztlich in die-
ser Gründung und zudem in der seinen Namen  verkün-
denden Gedenktafel am Gebäude seine Eitelkeit, welcher 
er dank seiner Ressourcen auf diese wohltätige Weise 
opfern konnte, befriedigt findet. Somit kann persönliche 
Eitelkeit genauso Positives für eine Gemeinschaft bewir-
ken. 
Pascals und Wittgensteins Nachgeborene können dem-
nach  anhand eines solchen Grundes ein gänzlich geän-
dertes Verständnis dieses Begriffes entwickeln. Solch ein 
Grund könnte die Abkehr von der religiösen Dimension 
dieses Begriffes bedeuten, welcher nun als Phänomen der 
Selbstermächtigung und Selbstbestimmtheit, ja auch der 
Selbstbewusstheit eines Menschen verstanden wird.

Jesus sprich im Neuen Testament den Eitlen auch einer 
guten, aber aus Eitelkeit vollzogenen Handlung die Vergel-
tung im Himmel ab. „Sie haben ihren Lohn schon hier er-
halten“ ( Matth. 6,2).  
Dieses Urteil würde dann folgerichtig  einen eitlen Spi-
talsgründer treffen. Dieser kann aber dem – entsäkulari-
siert und die Erfordernisse der Ökonomie sinnvoll nutzend 
– die Parole entgegenhalten: „Tue Gutes und sprich dar-
über!“ 
Bedacht werden kann gleichermaßen, dass die Eitelkeit 
in ihrer Erscheinung als todbringende Selbstverliebtheit 
lange vor Pascal und Wittgenstein eine mythologische Di-
mension erhält, welche deren gleichsam moralisch-
ästhetische Ambivalenz einzigartig aufzeigt. Die antike 
griechische Legende vom schönen Knaben Narkissos, 
welcher an der Liebe zu seinem Spiegelbild – also durch-
aus an seiner Eitelkeit – zugrunde geht, hat ja nicht nur 
diesen letalen Ausgang. Aus seiner Leiche erwächst als 
bleibendes Zeichen die Narzisse, die schöne, auch göttli-
chen Wesen angenehme, ja ihnen sogar  Erinnerung an 
den schönen Jüngling ermöglichende  Blume. Im Äußeren 
dieses sich der Eitelkeit verdankenden wunderbaren Ge-
wächses verwirklicht sich nochmals und dauernd des eit-
len Knaben Schönheit, ihr Name – abgeleitet von νάρκη = 
Erstarrung – verweist auf die Ursache ihres Daseins und 
ihres Wesens. 
Das doppelte in der Legende objektivierte  Mythologem 
– die todbringende Selbstverliebtheit und das Entsprießen 
der Blume – lässt für die dort waltende Eitelkeit durchaus 
eine aktuelle Definition derselben zu: dass sie nämlich „im 
objektiven Sinne eine unbedachte Antwort auf die Ver-
gänglichkeit des Lebens und aller Dinge“ ist (Schischkoff 
1991, S 159). In ihrer Realisierung könnte sie dann eben-
so verstanden werden als das sich selbst Belohnende, 
welches eines Lohnes außerhalb ihrer selbst nicht mehr 
bedarf. Ein von Jesus verheißener späterer Lohn im Him-
mel ist unnötig. Immerhin kann der Gedanke zugelassen 
werden, dass der in seinem Spiegelbild zum Tod erstarrte 
Narkissos in der Verzückung seiner Selbstverliebtheit ge-
storben ist und schon deshalb keines Lohnes mehr bedurf-
te. Dieser wurde ihm aber post mortem  trotzdem auf myt-
hische Weise von einer höheren Instanz zuteil durch die 
den Himmlischen wie den Irdischen wohlgefällige Blume. 
Pascal und Wittgenstein definieren die Eitelkeit nicht. Sie 
machen sie manifest anhand von Erscheinungsformen und 
Folgeerscheinungen. Selbstredend müssen beide in ihrem 
Vorgehen als fest auf dem Grund christlicher, durch das 
Evangelium vorgegebener Anschauungen stehend begrif-
fen werden. In diesem Sinne ist beider Vorgehen biblisch 
abgesichert im Jesuswort, dass ein Mensch in seinem Tun 
an den Früchten erkannt wird (Matth. 7, 16). Und somit ist 
auch Wittgensteins Dictum von der Wertminderung der 
Arbeit durch die Eitelkeit recht leicht aus dem Jesuswort 
vom Lohn her zu begreifen. Unter dem Aspekt einer Lohn-
gerechtigkeit hat demnach der von Gottes gütiger wie ge-
rechter Hand gegebene  himmlische Lohn höheren Wert 
als der sich selbst gegebene. Letzterer hat bloß den Wert 
hinsichtlich einer eigenen an sich vorgenommenen Ein- 
und damit Wertschätzung. Gott als Schöpfer kann aber die 
Lohnwürdigkeit anhand des Wertes einer Handlung im 
Ganzen der Schöpfung und für dieses bewerten. Er allein 
kann dies und tut es dem Glauben gemäß.  
Hier ist nun ein Punkt, an welchem eine Entscheidungs-
frage gestellt werden muss! Deren einzigartiges Wesen 
liegt darin, dass ihre Beantwortung niemals aufgrund un-
widerlegbarer Schlüsse gegeben werden kann. Gemäß 
der Terminologie säkularisierter Gesellschaften sind hier 
ausschließlich Schlussfolgerungen möglich, welchen die 
Qualität einer eigenen Meinung als einer „Privatsache“ 
zukommt. Denn! Wenn Religion als eine solche „Privatsa-
che“ gilt, dann kann auch deren wie immer geartete Alter-
native keinen anderen Status beanspruchen! Beides be-
ruht im Letzten auf eigener Meinung, welche zwar wohl – 
aber nicht letztbegründet sein kann.  
Auf der Folie dieser Frage und deren Durchdringung ver-
langt folgerichtig der Gedanke sein Recht, was denn im 
Kontext mit einer jeweiligen Meinung Aussagen von Men-
schen wie Wittgenstein und Pascal als individueller Mei-
nungsinhaber für eine Bedeutung beanspruchen können. 
Genügt es, jene als historisch bedeutsame Persönlichkei-
ten einzuschätzen, denen gegenüber es die Aufgabe ist, 
die geschichtlichen Gegebenheiten aufzudecken, um 
manches beiseite zu lassen, damit „moderne“ Fragen ge-
stellt werden können, ohne auf Erkenntnisse der Älteren 
verzichten zu müssen?  
Wie soll sich demnach die nachgeborene Wissen-
schaftsgesellschaft im Zusammenhang mit den Fragen 
nach der Eitelkeit zu wittgenstein’schen und pascal’schen 
Bemerkungen folgender Art verhalten? „Die Weisheit ist 
etwas Kaltes und insofern Dummes. (Der Glaube dagegen 
eine Leidenschaft)“ (Wittgenstein 1989, S 530). Oder: 
<<C’est le cœur qui sent Dieu, et non la raison; voilà ce 
que c’est la foi….. Le cœur  a ses raisons, que la raison ne 
connaît pas>> (Pascal 2010, §680). <<Cœur>> ist freilich 
in seiner Gefühlsintensität bei Pascal ein präziser religiö-
ser Begriff und damit ein für den Menschen in dessen 
Empfindungsfähigkeit stehendes religiöses Symbol. Über 
die Qualität eines solchen bemerkt Wittgenstein: „Einem 
religiösen Symbol liegt keine Meinung   zugrunde. Und nur 
der Meinung entspricht der Irrtum“ (Rothhaupt 2011, § 
112). 
Unter solchen Gesichtspunkten wäre dann die Bewusst-
heit eigener Eitelkeit keine Meinung, sondern durch sinnli-
che Erkenntnis erfahrene Tatsächlichkeit, mit der Qualität 
eines religiösen Symbols, nicht einer Meinung. In dieser 
Hinsicht ist Eitelkeitsbewusstheit ein Ergebnis praktischen 
Handelns. Die damit gewonnenen Begriffe sind keine sol-
chen der Theologie und demnach eindeutig. Denn die Got-
teswissenschaft – so Wittgenstein – „fuchtelt sozusagen 
mit den Worten herum, weil sie etwas sagen will und nicht 
weiß, wie sie es ausdrücken kann. Die Praxis gibt den 
Worten ihren Sinn“ (Wittgenstein 1989 , S 105f). 
Aber freilich: in welcher Lebenswelt vollzieht sich diese 
Praxis? Ist es eine, die nachvollzogen werden kann und 
soll? Genügt es nicht, Pascal und Wittgenstein als zweifel-
los Große einer Vorzeit auf das zu reduzieren, was eine 
Nachzeit interessiert und wo Rezeption und Weiterentwick-
lung stattfindet? Jedoch: etwas in einem „Heute“ anders 
sehen als in einem „Früher“ heißt keineswegs, die Frage 
nach diesem Etwas abschließend beantwortet zu haben.  
Als Historiker halte ich es für unverzichtbar hinsichtlich 
von Erkenntnisbildung, sich um eine „Gesamtheit der Tat-
sachen“ zu bemühen. Etwas herauszulösen aus dieser 
Gesamtheit für ein bestimmtes „Heute“ ist ein Akt der Ei-
telkeit mittels hochmütigen Verzichts. Es ist zudem ein Akt 
der Missachtung, des arroganten Hinunterschauens auf 
„heute überwundene Positionen“. Aber als Historiker er-
staunt es mich keineswegs, dass es solche „Heutige“ zu 
allen Vor- und Nachzeiten gegeben hat. Zumal „aufgeklär-
te“ Zeiten aller Epochen rezipieren vergangene Größe un-
ter dem Aspekt gegenwärtiger Brauchbarkeit ziemlich aus-
schließlich mit dem Ziel, damit eigener „Größe“ dienlich zu 
sein.

Ich plädiere demnach für den „ganzen“ Wittgenstein und 
somit folgerichtig ebenso für jenen, welcher sich selbst 
zuruft: „Das Gebäude Deines Stolzes ist abzutragen. Und 
es gibt furchtbare Arbeit“ (Wittgenstein 1989, S 485). 
Wittgenstein und Pascal erkennen sich selbst als Prota-
gonisten des Dramas von der menschlichen Eitelkeit. Die-
ses hat durch sie seine aktuelle Fortsetzung. Die jeweils 
neuen Möglichkeiten der Wissenschaften führen nicht zur 
Überwindung, sondern zu neuen Eitelkeitsmöglichkeiten.  
Demnach halten es beide für unabdingbar,  die Wissen-
schaften auf deren Eitelkeitskoeffizienten hin abzuklopfen. 
Aus der Feststellung der Eitelkeitsmöglichkeiten der Wis-
senschaften ergibt sich für Pascal folgerichtig eine qualita-

The “No Transcendence, therefore Relativism”- Argument and the 
Possibility of Non-Relative Judgements 
Patricia Meindl

Abstract 
In this paper I am concerned with Harvey Siegel‘s attempt to reject the Strong Programme‘s epistemological relativism by refut-
ing the „No transcendence, therefore relativism“-argument. In the first part of the paper I will argue that a great part of Siegel‘s 
attempt to refute the argument from the impossibility of transcendence fails, because it hinges on an implausible interpretation 
of the Strong Programme’s epistemological relativism. Nevertheless, in the second part of the paper I want to elaborate on and 
sharpen up one aspect of Siegel‘s attempted refutation – the ,roomier‘ perspective – by arguing that this idea could in fact offer 
a fruitful account on how to challenge the relativist’s assumptions concerning the requirements of non-relative judgements. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
This paper deals with Harvey Siegel‘s attempt to reject 
Strong Programme‘s (SP) epistemological relativism by 
refuting an argument, which he takes to be the basis of 
SP‘s relativism: the „No Transcendence, therefore Relativ-
ism“-argument (NTTR-argument). This very argument, 
however, is constructed not by proponents of SP, but by 
Siegel himself to capture and express the main idea be-
hind SP‘s relativism. For this reason, I will begin by briefly 
examining the origin of the argument and its counterpart, 
the SP‘s locality claim (this is Siegel‘s terminology; for the 
original passage see Barnes and Bloor 1987, 27). This is a 
suitable starting point, because Siegel‘s formulation of the 
NTTR-argument embodies some ambiguous phrases al-
lowing for different interpretations of the argument. I will 
then move on to a discussion of Siegel‘s critique of this 
argument and his suggested way of refuting it. Thereby, I 
will defend the claim that Siegel‘s attempt to reject SP‘s 
relativism by undermining the conclusion of the NTTR-
argument, encounters two distinct difficulties: (1) Siegel‘s 
refutation can only be considered to be a proper response 
to the argument‘s conclusion, if he applies a very strong 
interpretation of SP‘s relativism. Hence, the success of the 
attempted refutation hinges on the plausibility of this – in 
my view – questionable reading of SP‘s relativism. (2) If 
one denies this rather strong interpretation of relativism in 
favour of a more charitable version, it is not clear anymore 
in which way Siegel‘s attempts could even count as a 
proper response to SP‘s relativism. Nevertheless, in the 
last section of the paper, I want to elaborate on and 
sharpen up one aspect of Siegel‘s paper – the ,roomier‘ 
perspective – by arguing that this idea could in fact offer a 
fruitful account on how to challenge the relativistic idea 
concerning the requirements of non-relative judgements.  
2. The „No Transcendence, therefore Rela-
tivism“-Argument  
According to the Strong Programme‘s locality claim a rela-
tivist accepts that his/her evaluations are inevitably con-
text-bound and that her preferences cannot be expressed 
in absolute, context-independent terms. Further, he/she 
embraces the fact that whatever justification is brought up 
by a certain community, its credibility is necessarily limited 
since every justification eventually terminates at some 
principle or standard that only has local credibility (see 
Barnes and Bloor 1982, 27). This is considered to be the 
central passage expressing SP's commitment to epistemo-
logical relativism, claiming that „since there is no 
,perspectiveless‘ judgement, there is no possibility of 
achieving a perspective that would allow us to non-
question-beggingly compare and evaluate either judg-
ments issued from different perspectives, or alternative 
perspectives themselves.“ (Siegel 2011,  51). This claim, in 
turn, is transformed by Siegel into the thesis stated below, 
expressing an alleged entailment between the following 
two claims:  
[...] the uncontroversial claim that all judgements inevi-
tably occur in some perspective or other [...] might be 
thought to entail that all judgements are therefore 
bound or determined by such perspectives, which are in 
effect inescapable [...]. (Siegel 2011, 51)  
One way to give this entailment-thesis the shape of an ar-
gument for epistemological relativism is outlined by Siegel 
and is named the „No Transcendence, therefore Relativ-
ism“ argument. Siegel considers this argument to be the 
basis of SP‘s relativism:    
No Transcendence: 
(1) 
Non-relative judgements require the possibility of  
 
getting outside of, freeing oneself from the  
 
influence of, or transcending one's perspective,  
 
framework, or conceptual scheme. 
(2) 
It is not possible to escape or transcend one's  
 
conceptual scheme. 
 
There is no 'perspectiveless perspective' from  
 
which one can judge. 
(3) 
Therefore, relativism.  
 
(Siegel 2011, 51) 
One might wonder now, why I am putting so much empha-
sis on the origin of the NTTR-argument and its relation to 
the entailment-thesis and in further consequence the local-
ity-claim. The reason for this lies in the fact that Siegel‘s 
NTTR-argument, as well as the entailment-thesis are am-
biguous. However, before addressing the nature of this 
ambiguity, I will discuss Siegel‘s critique of the NTTR-
argument.  
3. Siegel‘s critique  
According to Siegel the argument suffers from an ambigu-
ity in the term transcendence occurring in both premises 
(1) and (2). Most importantly, his claim is that once this 
ambiguity is dissolved by means of a terminological dis-
tinction, the argument loses its prima facie plausibility and, 
further, the argument can be easily refuted by reference to 
various empirical counter-examples rendering the conclu-

sion of the argument – epistemological relativism – invalid 
(see Siegel 2011, 51-53).  
Now, what is this redeeming distinction about? Siegel is 
proposing a distinction between (a) transcending all per-
spectives and (b) transcending any given perspective (see 
Siegel 2011, 51). By means of these distinctive notions of 
transcending one can grant the uncontroversial claim that 
we cannot reach a ,perspectiveless perspective‘ (i.e. tran-
scending all perspectives) while making sure that one can 
nevertheless escape from a given perspective or over-
come one perspective in favour of another (i.e. transcend-
ing any given perspective). The latter notion of transcen-
dence then paves the way for various ,counter-examples‘ 
that serve as a touchstone for the possibility of changing 
one‘s perspective, f.e. the child‘s possibility of modifying its 
understanding of the nature of numbers, or the discovery 
of the microscope, that inevitably altered „our understand-
ing of the range of existing things“ (Siegel 2011, 52). Re-
ferring to this type of ,transcendence‘, Siegel concludes:  
[...] the conclusion [of the NTTR-argument, PM] is un-
dermined by several counterexamples offered: epis-
temic agents always judge from some perspective or 
other, but there is no reason to think that they are 
trapped in or bound by their perspectives such that they 
cannot subject them to critical scrutiny. In this sense, 
we can ‘transcend’ our perspectives; and this sense is 
sufficient to defeat the argument for relativism we have 
been considering. (Siegel 2011, 53)  
In fact, these counter-examples can serve as evidence for 
the possibility of changing one‘s perspectives, of overcom-
ing one perspective in favor of another one. However, the 
urgent question now is: In which sense is this rebuttal 
really sufficient to defeat the argument for epistemological 
relativism?  
4. Two Problems in Siegel‘s refutation of 
the NTTR-argument 
As already outlined above, Siegel‘s NTTR-argument was 
supposed to reflect SP‘s locality claim stating, amongst 
others, the impossibility of reaching context-independent 
evaluations. However, it is not really clear whether this 
claim is truly mirrored in the formulation of the argument 
given Siegel‘s use of the ambiguous phrase „transcending 
one‘s perspective“. However, if the NTTR-argument is to 
be at the programmatic core of SP, the argument can be 
modified in the following way:  
(1a) Non-relative judgements require the possibility of 
transcending one‘s perspective in terms of transcending 
all perspectives. 
(2a) It is not possible to transcend all perspectives. 
There is no ,perspectiveless perspective‘ from which 
one can judge. 
(3a) Therefore, relativism.  
This refined version of the NTTR-argument plausibly re-
flects the SP‘s thesis while avoiding any misguiding termi-
nological ambiguities. However, if this is true, it is not clear 
anymore in which way Siegel‘s emphasis on the possibility 
of changing one‘s perspective as illustrated by the various 
examples, could undermine the argument‘s conclusion. 
How could e.g. the change of perspectives encountered by 
children when passing through different cognitive stages 
be a threat for epistemological relativism?  
However, there is one possible way Siegel‘s counterex-
amples could challenge relativism: by means of a very 
specific interpretation of epistemological relativism denying 
the possibility of changing one‘s perspectives. In fact, this 
reading could plausibly be suggested by Siegel‘s formula-
tion of the entailment-thesis already quoted in section 2:  
[...] the uncontroversial claim that all judgements inevi-
tably occur in some perspective or other [...] might be 
thought to entail that all judgements are therefore 
bound or determined by such perspectives, which are in 
effect inescapable [...]. (Siegel 2011, 51) 
It is important to see that the formulation of the latter claim 
allows for two different readings: It could either (A) claim 
that every judgement is bound by a perspective and this 
very perspective is inescapable, or (B) state that though all 
judgements are bound by perspectives, they nevertheless 
allow to be ,transcended‘ in favor of another perspective. 
(In this latter case, the clause concerning the inescapabil-
ity refers to the impossibility of escaping all perspectives.)  
Now, if (A) would be the thesis to argue against, Siegel‘s 
counter-examples could plausibly be considered as chal-
lenging this version of relativism. One needs to ask, 
though, what one really gains by such a refutation that 
necessarily hinges on the plausibility of this strong and 
certainly controversial interpretation of relativism. More-
over, the original problem – how to refute the ,weaker rela-
tivist‘ defending (B) – remains untouched.  
In the following section I will address the question 
whether Siegel‘s emphasis on the changeability of per-
spectives could be considered to have an impact not so 
much on the conclusion of the argument, but rather on its 
presuppositions concerning the requirements of non-
relative judgements.   
5. The 'roomier' framework 
One possible way to challenge the (modified) NTTR-
argument consists in denying the truth of the first premise 
(1a), i.e. denying that non-relative judgements require the 
possibility of transcending all perspectives. Instead one 
could argue that non-relative judgements require the pos-
sibility of transcending any given perspective as seems to 
be suggested by Siegel. The urging question then is: In 
which sense do non-relative judgements require the possi-
bility of changing one‘s perspective? Unfortunately, 
Siegel‘s own remarks on this issue are quite scarce and 
sketchy and are in fact reducible to the following consid-
erations upon the notion of the ‘roomier’ perspective:  
[...] we can and regularly do 'transcend' our frameworks 
from the perspective of other, 'roomier' ones, in which 
can fit both our earlier one and relevant rivals to it – and 
in this way fair, non-relative evaluations of both our 
judgements and the frameworks/perspectives from 
which they are made are possible. (Siegel 2011, 54) 
As I take it, Siegel is making two interrelated claims here: 
Firstly, he is stating that we are overcoming a framework 
from the perspective of a 'roomier' one, which is encom-
passing the earlier framework and relevant rivals to it. And 
secondly, he appears to claim that from the perspective of 
this 'roomier' framework, non-relative evaluations of both 
our judgements and the frameworks or perspectives, from 
which these judgements are made, are possible. There are 
two questions to be addressed here: (1) Is a 'roomier' 
framework sufficient to yield non-relative judgements? (2) 
What does it mean to speak of non-relative judgements in 
this context? A necessary precondition for thinking about 
possible answers to (1) consists in providing an adequate 
account of (2). Based on Siegel‘s considerations regarding

193
the ,roomier‘ perspective, one could distinguish between 
two notions of the ,non-relative‘:  
1. absolutely non-relative  
2. relatively non-relative 
This distinction suggests that there is a notion of the non-
relative, (a), that corresponds to the ideas of a „God‘s eye 
view“ or a „view from nowhere“. Reaching this point of view 
lies beyond a human beings‘ horizon of possibilities. How-
ever, although this point of view (which is in fact no point of 
view at all) is per definition unreachable, this does not pre-
clude the possibility of approximating it. This idea, then, 
gives rise to (b), the notion of the ,relatively non-relative‘ 
yielded by the ,roomier‘ perspective. In contrast to (a), rela-
tively non-relative judgements are made from a certain 
perspective, but this perspective is of a distinctive quality: it 
is a roomier one.  
This suggests a picture that does not only reflect the fact 
that judgements are made from some perspective or an-
other. It also accounts for the origin of these perspectives 
as arising by overcoming formerly held perspectives, 
though still entailing all these ,predecessors‘ as preserved 
elements. In order to sharpen this point and to emphasise 
its bearing on the possibility of relatively non-relative 
judgements, I will make use of an analogy from the per-
ception of spatio-temporal objects against the backdrop of 
Husserl‘s phenomenology of perception1: It is an uncon-
tested fact that a three-dimensional, spatial object is al-
ways perceived from some perspective or another. How-
ever, one could argue – analogous to the relativistic posi-
tion considered above – that no objective view on this ob-
ject is possible, since every view is necessarily dependent 
on some or another perspective. Since there is no per-
spectiveless perspective, there is no possibility of taking in 
an objective view on the very object. However, one could 
simply deny the suggested requirements on objective 
views, and regard one’s possibility to change perspectives 
as a suitable instrument to make out those features of the 
object that remain invariable throughout the variation of 
perspectives (see Husserl 1939, 410ff.). In turn, this is to  
 
                                                      
1 I owe this idea to Harald Wiltsche.  
say that passing through the various perspectives makes it 
possible to filter out those features that persist independ-
ent of an observer’s perspective. Hence, objectivity, un-
derstood as the independence of an observer’s perspec-
tive, is made possible through the variation of perspec-
tives. This shows that the possibility of changing one’s 
perspectives occupies a pivotal role in taking in an objec-
tive view. In this sense, the roominess of a given perspec-
tive considered above could be seen as reflecting the 
range of perspectives that can be subjected to the process 
of variation. This is made possible, in turn, through the ac-
count of formerly held perspectives as preserved elements 
of the wider perspective encompassing them. Hence, if it 
could be shown that the method of variation can also be 
undertaken in the realm of judgments and evaluation, this 
would have direct significance for the possibility of (rela-
tively) non-relative judgements. For a central presupposi-
tion the relativist is committed to, could then be regarded 
as refuted: the boundedness or determination of a judge-
ment by the particular perspective from which it is made. 
However, as these rather sketchy considerations suggest, 
there is much work to be done in order to strengthen this 
account on the possibility of non-relative judgements by 
clarifying the established analogy and even more impor-
tantly by giving a clear and elaborated account on whether 
and how the method of variation could be applied in the 
relevant realm.

A difficulty in the foundation of Analytic Philosophy

Abstract 
This paper discusses some assumptions about language and philosophy underlying the programme of linguistic analysis. It 
questions the tenability of those assumptions and argues that they provide insufficient support for making the usual division 
between Analytic and Continental Philosophy. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
The historian of Analytic Philosophy (AP) is faced with a 
twofold problem. First, it is controversial which pieces of 
philosophy fall under the denomination ‘AP’ with respect to 
subject matter, protagonists, methods used, positions re-
garding the history of philosophy, relations with science or 
everyday life, etc. Second, analysis as a method of phi-
losophical investigation occurs in such multifarious ways 
with respect to its procedures and targets that ‘analytic’ 
scarcely is a suitable predicate to determine the specificity 
of a particular philosophical tradition. It has been argued 
that if one could solve this problem at all by determining 
families of partially overlapping features and pick out in-
stances of philosophical work which have such features as 
belonging to AP, such a family resemblance approach 
should at least be supplemented by historical research to 
single out paradigmatic cases (Glock 2008 223).  
However responsible such an approach might be, the 
ease with which it is often taken for granted that the histo-
riography of AP sometimes boils down to a game of diver-
sifying the philosophical tradition into AP and Continental 
philosophy (CP) could trigger one to try and find another 
approach in which the polemic flavour of this diversification 
is taken as something which should be reckoned with. 
Such an alternative way to deal with the abovementioned 
problem is to approach this game as representing a con-
stellation in which the denominations ‘AP’ and ‘CP’ func-
tion in a programmatic declaration of philosophical values 
by self-styled analytic philosophers distancing themselves 
from a tradition which is deemed not to comply with these 
values. In this approach, the aforementioned denomina-
tions do not stand for distinctive philosophical traditions; as 
interdependent they rather signal a polemic stance which 
thus constitutes the Analytic-Continental Divide (ACD). In 
ACD each denomination is a construct intended to refer 
exclusively to AP as a revolutionary programme (Ryle 
1956) versus CP as its ‘Other’ (Glendinning 2006 35). This 
approach is well-suited to articulate prevalent controver-
sies by employing a sort of antithetic procedure (Kant 
21787 421) which focuses on the dialectics involved in an-
tagonistic claims concerning the self-understanding and 
other-ascriptions of diversifying features in the philosophi-
cal tradition by adherents of AP, rather than on systematic 
or historic aspects of this tradition itself. This approach 
seeks to establish a common ground of the seemingly con-
tradictory assumptions which underlie these claims rather 
than to assess the soundness of the arguments advanced 
to support them.  
In this paper this procedure is applied to a self-
understanding and some other-ascriptions of AP in con-
nection with some assumptions underlying its ‘fundamental 
axiom’ (section 2). It will be argued that these assumptions 
provide insufficient support for making the usual division 
between AP and CP (section 3).  
2. The ‘fundamental axiom’ of Analytic Phi-
losophy   
The programmatic nature of the denomination ‘AP’, cover-
ing its goal and method and paying tribute to one of its 
founders, Frege, is apparent in Dummett’s declaration, 
which is received as AP’s best-known characterisation 
(Levy 2003 289). Dummett declares that philosophy’s goal 
is the analysis of thought—(the study of) which is “sharply” 
to be distinguished “… from [the study of] the psychologi-
cal process of thinking”—through the analysis of language 
(Dummett 1978 458). Moreover, since the declaration lim-
its the domain of philosophy to studies which subscribe to 
the values it champions it is an instance of ‘Othering’, by 
which a segment of the philosophical tradition arbitrarily is 
reduced to “the idea of its own Other” (Glendinning 2006 
13). This applies to Dummett’s implicit identification of the 
phenomenological school with CP (Levy 2003 290), none 
of which is an ongoing research programme in the sense 
in which AP takes itself it to be. Considering that a concep-
tion of AP insofar as it should conform to Dummett’s decla-
ration hinges on the methodological connection between 
the analysis of thought (in an emphatic non-psychologistic 
sense) and the analysis of language, it are the assump-
tions underlying this connection that merit attention.  
The idea advanced in Dummett’s declaration that the 
analysis of thought should proceed through the analysis of 
language is problematic at face value since it is not clear 
what here is meant by ‘analysis’. As Beany (2014) ob-
serves, “various conceptions of analysis compete and pull 
in different directions”; “reductive and connective, revision-
ary and descriptive, linguistic and psychological, formal 
and empirical elements all coexist in creative tension”. In 
particular, it is unclear what in connection with Dummett’s 
declaration is to be understood by the ‘analysis of thought’ 
over and above what is understood by the ‘analysis of lan-
guage’. What is clear, however, is that Dummett’s declara-
tion bears an assumption concerning a correlation which 
would obtain between thought and language so as to sat-
isfy the condition that the analysis of thought should pro-
ceed through the analysis of language. On this assump-
tion, the analysis focuses on those elements of language 
which are expressions of thought; it is restricted to sen-
tences “in which we communicate [mitteilen] or state [be-
haupten] something” the truth of which can be assessed, 
i.e. declarative sentences (Behauptungssätze). The analy-
sis which Dummett’s declaration envisages neither has 
sentences which do not express thoughts as their objects 
(e.g. imperatives, optatives), nor is it interested in differ-
ences of linguistic expressions which do not affect the 
thought which is expressed in them (e.g. whether the ex-

A difficulty in the foundation of Analytic Philosophy | Karel Mom 
 
 
 
195
pression is a sentence in the active or the passive mode). 
Finally, it does not take constituents of declarative sen-
tences into account which do not contribute to the expres-
sion of a thought and which, incidentally, are deemed 
characteristic of poetic language (Frege 1918 33, 34-37; 
1919 54). 
The emphatic distinction between thought and the psy-
chological process of thinking, moreover, marks off the 
purported anti-psychologism of AP. Reverting to Frege as 
the source of inspiration for Dummett’s declaration again, 
this anti-psychologism is directed against the conflation of 
the psychological laws which govern the process of a 
thought’s being held for true and the logical laws which 
govern a thought’s being true (Frege 1918 30-31). Accord-
ingly, it is the explication of the latter, with the exclusion of 
the former, which Dummett’s declaration envisages. If the 
only route to the analysis of the thoughts which are gov-
erned by these logical laws should take the analysis of 
language as its point of departure, linguistic analysis will 
focus on declarative sentences insofar as they can be 
considered as the stating (das Behaupten) of the truth of a 
thought. The exclusion of the psychological aspects of 
these statements implies that on this account linguistic 
analysis should disregard all mentalistic connotations of 
“the grasping of the thought” in thinking, and the recogni-
tion of the truth of a thought in a judgement (Frege 1918 
35), both of which the existence of a statement presup-
poses.  
The “fundamental axiom” (Dummett 1993 128) of AP, 
which holds that philosophical questions are to be treated 
as “questions about the use of linguistic expressions” 
(Rorty 1967 11)—‘use’ here not to be taken in its technical 
‘meaning-as-use’ sense—might by some be accepted as 
sufficiently presuppositionless, indeed as initially having 
“an air of triviality” (Smith 1989 29), so as to imply that the 
burden of proof lie with those who oppose it, as Rorty 
(1967 12) suggests. However, in view of the constraints 
the axiom imposes on the scope of the intended linguistic 
analysis it seems fair to say that the axiom “presupposes a 
particular framework of interpretation” of language (Beany 
2014). For it is such a framework that is presupposed in 
the definition of AP according to Dummett’s declaration 
which should warrant that a distinction is made between 
the logic and the grammar of linguistic expressions; and 
that in accordance with this distinction priority, if not exclu-
sivity is bestowed on logical grammar as the target of lin-
guistic analysis. As such, Dummett’s declaration, rather 
than phrasing a mere methodological maxim is vulnerable 
to the objection that it is committed to “substantive phi-
losophical theses” about the “nature of language” and the 
“nature of philosophy” (Rorty 1967 9).  
An answer to this objection would consist in introducing 
the concept of ‘thought’ and explaining its correlation with 
language in a way which does not carry assumptions con-
cerning their linguistic import. However, this is not what 
Frege does. Frege (1918 35) introduces this key concept 
recursively by determining thought as the object of think-
ing, i.e. the ‘grasping of the thought’; and he defines ‘stat-
ing’ (das Behaupten) as the declaration (Kundgebung) of a 
judgement, i.e. the ‘recognition of the truth of a thought’. 
Frege (1919 63n.) admits the difficulty caused by the split 
in the concept of ‘judgement’ of the concepts ‘thought’, i.e. 
the meaning (Sinn) of a sentence, and ‘truth’. This split, 
with the ensuing separation of the ‘grasping of the thought’ 
and judging (Frege 1919 55), poses a difficulty indeed. 
For, one can observe that it is because the link between 
thought and statement thus requires the mediation by the 
judgement, and hence, that the truth of a thought is carried 
over to the meaning of a statement only indirectly through 
the judgement that the inextricable bond between truth and 
meaning (Smith 1989 11) is severed. Frege (1919 63n.) 
addresses this difficulty by asserting that “one must here 
make a halt” with definition, stipulating that only a thought 
can be recognized as true (just as it was stipulated that the 
question of truth only can arise with respect to a thought, 
and asserted that probably the “content of the word ‘true’ is 
one-of-a-kind and undefinable” (Frege 1918 32, 33)). The 
ambiguity about the logical and linguistic import of ‘judge-
ment’ in Frege’s discourse, though, can illustrate the per-
sistence of this difficulty (cf. Frege’s use of the word 
‘thought’ in the logical sense of ‘judgement’; his urge to 
distinguish between “thoughts and judgement”; and his 
concession that the common sense meaning of ‘judge-
ment’ is best captured by ‘act of judging’ (Frege 1918 33n., 
35n., 1919 63n.).  
The above observation seizes upon metaphilosophical 
assumptions about language and about philosophy which 
underlie the fundamental axiom of AP. It challenges this 
axiom as suggesting, on a metaphilosophical level, that 
the analysis of the meaning of a statement is not ex-
hausted by the logical analysis of the proposition which it 
is taken to express. In particular, that “to try to explain in 
general what it is to say something true … , reference to 
belief or to assertion (and thereby to belief) is inescapable” 
(Strawson 1971 189). Specifically, the function of the 
judgement as it features in Frege’s discourse as the inter-
mediary between a true statement and the truth of a 
thought indicates that on the level of linguistic analysis 
“[r]eference, direct or indirect, to belief-expression is in-
separable from the analysis of saying something true (or 
false)” (Strawson 1971 189). Therefore, it cannot be main-
tained that the question of truth only can arise with respect 
to the meaning of a sentence but it has to be conceded 
that linguistic analysis can distribute the functions of mean-
ing and truth among “the sentence or expression” and “the 
use of the sentence or expression” respectively (Strawson 
1950 9). 
3. The Analytic-Continental Divide  
To clarify the relevance of the above observation for the 
argument of this paper. The intermediary function of 
‘judgement’ in Frege’s metaphilosophical discourse, and 
the corollary language-logic ambiguity in his discussion of 
‘judgement’ need not imply a commitment to psychologism 
of Frege’s explication of ‘the grasping of the thought’ 
(Smith 1989 25) any more than do e.g. Kant’s theory of 
judgement and the corollary product-process ambiguity in 
Kant’s discussion of the logical form of judgements (Kant 
21787 141). By contrast, the above observation allows a 
deconstruction of the ‘fundamental axiom’ of AP to the ef-
fect that the constraints it imposes on the scope of linguis-
tic analysis are shown to be unjustified. Consequently, this 
axiom neither provides an obvious support for the claim 
that “we do not need to look very far to see that not every 
sort of ‘analysis of language’ is here admissible” (Smith 
1989 30) nor for the concern about the inclusion of some 
philosophers, notably Heidegger, on one hand, and the 
exclusion of paradigmatic representatives (Evans, Witt-
genstein) on the other (Glock 2008 132; Levy 2003 289) in 
AP’s pantheon, even if the affinity of philosophical with lin-
guistic terminology might induce a linguistic philosopher to 
think otherwise. Thus, if an analysis of language is admit-
ted which operates with a notion of ‘negation’ (Verneinung) 
such that the negation of a thought is taken as not affect-
ing its content (cf. Frege 1919 59) it is to be elucidated 
why an analysis of language which operates with a notion 
of ‘negation’ (Verneinung) such that the negation of a re-

 196
pressed content of a thought is taken as a condition of be-
ing conscious of that content (Freud 1925 373) should be 
inadmissible. In the absence of an elucidation of this sort 
one can hardly oppose an interpretation of a sentence like 
“I have not thought that.” as indicating someone’s being 
conscious of just that thought (Freud 1925 377).     
Whatever one could say of Monk’s characterisation of 
Dummett’s axiom as “the basis for a piece of unashamed 
dogmatism” (Monk 1997 35), it points perhaps at a per-
spective for linguistic analysis as a critique of philosophical 
discourse, where ‘critique’ should be taken in the sense of 
the elucidation of philosophy’s own metaphilosophical as-
sumptions.

Logical Form in the Analytic and Continental Tradition Sebastian 
Rödl’s Temporal Logic and Austin 
Aloisia Moser 
Berkeley, CA, USA | aloisiamoser@berkeley.edu 
Abstract 
According to Sebastian Rödl’s Categories of the Temporal a temporal logic must underlie the a-temporal logic that philosophy is 
usually occupied with, especially as it is discussed through representatives of the philosophical-linguistic or analytic tradition. 
Rödl argues that Analytic Philosophy does not appreciate that the human intellect is finite and depends on intuition. In this paper 
I present the structure of Rödl’s argument for a temporal logic, which he gains from Kant. Subsequently I discuss the implica-
tions of Rödl’s account of the form of thought as an act of them mind for a reading of Austin’s speech acts. 
 
 
“A thought is an act form, the form of an 
act of the mind.”  
(Rödl, Categories of the Temporal, 59) 
In this paper I discuss Sebastian Rödl’s account of the 
form of thought as the form of an act of the mind. In the 
first part I present Rödl’s complex account of the general 
form of thought as temporal, which he claims underlies the 
a-temporal logic usually discussed in the Anglo-American 
tradition of philosophy. In the second part I compare this 
form of an act of the mind to Austin’s account of performa-
tives as acts of language in How To Do Things with Words.  
1. Temporal Logic vs. A-temporal logic 
Sebastian Rödl’s undistinguished use of the terms Aus-
sage and thought come as a surprise first. In the German 
version of his book Categories of the Temporal Rödl writes 
about Aussagen while the English translation replaces the 
Term Aussage with thought. Rödl says in a prominent 
place that the word Aussage and the term thought are the 
same, because for his investigation it is indifferent whether 
he speaks of thoughts, statements or judgments since “this 
is one topic.” (Rödl, 20) What matters to him is to elaborate 
that underlying the a-temporal logic that philosophy is usu-
ally occupied with is a temporal logic. Rödl discusses a-
temporal logic through representatives of the analytic tradi-
tion, while temporal logic is introduced with Kant. A-
temporal logic is concerned with the way assertions, 
thoughts, or judgments relate to intuitions. Rödl argues, 
“the philosophical-linguistic tradition does not appreciate 
that the human intellect is finite and depends on intuition.” 
(Rödl, 134) 
Thought, according to Rödl is possible only though ge-
neric thought and general knowledge cannot be gleaned 
from the particular subject that has sense perception. This 
claim is Rödl’s death knell to empiricism: he thinks we can 
only get general knowledge through a general subject, or 
what he calls a subject form, not through the particular 
subject that has sense perception. But the claim of Rödl’s 
book is not only that human beings experience everything 
through categories of the temporal, but also that these 
temporal forms are the primordial logical forms: forms of 
human life as such.  
Unfortunately Salewski’s otherwise excellent translation 
renders the notion of “Form menschlichen Lebens, unter 
die er fällt“ (Rödl, 18-19), which means literally “form of 
human life, under which the subject falls” as general sub-
ject and subject form. This gives it quite a different ring and 
makes it more difficult to understand the whole dimension 
of Rödl’s claim. It is Rödl’s main thesis that “The primary 
subject of general knowledge insofar as it does not spring 
from sense perception cannot be a particular subject. It 
must be a general subject, a subject form” (Rödl, 13) or a 
form of human life. 
The term form of human life relates to the forms of life in 
Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations. While Rödl 
does not write about Wittgenstein in detail, he has a very 
interesting take on Wittgenstein’s concern with logic in the 
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and grammar in the Phi-
losophical Investigations. In a footnote he remarks that the 
Wittgenstein of the Philosophical Investigations is not con-
cerned with a philosophy of ordinary language, a view that 
he thinks is founded on the dogma that logical form of hu-
man life, under which the particular human falls is deduc-
tive logic. Instead he argues that because deductive logic 
cannot describe the forms of the finite intellect many phi-
losophers have concluded Wittgenstein looks at ordinary 
speech instead of logical form. Rödl’s answer is that Witt-
genstein does look at logical form, but at transcendentally 
logical form. His verdict is that “an analytic philosophy of 
language was up to now hardly able to develop,” (p. 167 
fn14) because of the focus on deductive logic.  
Rödl’s project is ambitious and has as its object the logi-
cal forms of temporal thought in their most abstract de-
scription. Rödl wants to a) identify these forms and b) 
show that they have necessity. He makes it clear that a) is 
inseparable from b). Form, he argues, can be discussed in 
logic in the narrower analytic sense and as logic as pure 
science of thought. Rödl suggests that the history of the 
analytic tradition could be rewritten as a history of the idea 
of logical form and its crisis. Even though logic is a pure 
science of thought also for the analytic tradition, it is so 
only in narrow sense, as the systematic investigation of a 
calculus. Rödl repeatedly points to a void in rendering the 
notion of a truly general and abstract logical form in ana-
lytic accounts. He shows that while Carnap, Ryle, 
Anscombe as well as McDowell say that the grammatical 
or logical form of thought cannot be exhausted by a sys-
tem of deductive relations, they do not say what it is.  
Rödl’s answer to this is a call to discuss logical form in 
terms of the way logical form relates to sensory intuition. 
“The principle of the form of thought is the relation of 
thought to intuition. The general form of thought is the form 
of thinking a content given through the senses.” (p. 143) 
Rödl inquires into the general form through which thought 
relates to intuition. He discusses externally temporal and 
internally temporal thought, as well as a third kind of form, 
namely time-general or generic thought. Here he argues 
that the generality of these forms does not lie in the quan-

tity of their subject, but in the way in which they join subject 
and predicate. So all three internal, external temporal form 
and general form are forms of predication of their own (p. 
10).  
External temporal form is the equivalent of tense. Rödl 
explains that each thought, assertion or judgment already 
is tensed in that it is past/present. This bipolar form of 
predication has underlying it another temporal form, which 
is an internal temporal form, namely aspect. Aspect is 
used to indicate whether an action is completed or ongoing 
and through that it expresses something about the internal 
extension of thought. Aspect according to Rödl is tripolar 
(has been doing/is doing/has done). To get the unity of 
predication we need not only a bipolar form of tense, which 
presupposes a tripolar form of aspect, but both presup-
pose a generic form of thought that is time-general. Rödl 
calls it the form of human life.  
But there is another difference to look at. Rödl holds that 
while analytic philosophy discusses the concepts of object 
and concept, he is interested in the notions of substance 
and state. For analytic philosophy a concept consists of a 
state and a tense, while present and past are elements of 
thought. Rödl claims that temporal thoughts are not struc-
tured in that way. The difference between a state and a 
concept is deeper. What he can see for now is that a 
thought conjoins substance and state insofar as it relates 
to intuitions, it conjoins object and concept insofar as it 
stands in a deductive relations to other thoughts” (p. 134). 
This is why Rödl discusses the categories of substance 
and state in connection with external time or tense, as well 
as the category of movement form in connection with in-
ternal time or aspect and finally the category of substance 
form in connection with generic thought that is time gen-
eral. These are the most general, pure concepts of the 
temporal or the categories of the finite intellect that we are. 
In conclusion, while the empiricist’s dogma is that knowl-
edge of particulars precedes general knowledge and does 
not depend on it, Rödl claims the opposite: empirical 
knowledge always already contains general knowledge, 
which is not inferred deductively from the former. Instead 
we have to look at the relation of thought to intuition, and 
this is what analytic philosophy, when relying on logic as 
inferential relations between concepts, has been missing 
out on. 
2. Austin  
In the first chapter of How To Do Things with Words Austin 
points out that the business of statements is to describe. 
Then he adds that a lot of things that would hitherto have 
been statements have been scrutinized anew. Since a 
“statement (of fact) ought to be ‘verifiable’” (Austin, 3) it 
turned out that a lot of statements are only what may be 
called pseudo-statements. Many statements can be shown 
to be, quote “as Kant perhaps first argued systematically, 
strictly nonsense, despite an unexceptionable grammatical 
form.” (Ibid.) Austin does not say much more about Kant, 
only that there is a limit to the amount of nonsense one is 
prepared to admit to talk and that he argued that people 
started to claim that pseudo-statements are not statements 
at all. Interestingly the gist of this is that they are state-
ments that are either not intended at all, or only in part. 
Austin then holds that these statements are not constative 
utterences, but performative utterances. With them we do 
not describe something but more or less do something.  
Not long after the introduction of the distinction between 
constative and performative statements Austin comes the 
realization that all statements, also constative ones, can 
be performative. Even though a statement is a description 
we can still use it for something else or do something with 
it at the same time, which makes it performative. Austin 
therefore holds that “it is not so much the thought but the 
act of asserting that is true or false.” (Rödl 60) 
Here lies the point of distention for Rödl who does not 
agree that the truth oft he sentence lies in the act of as-
serting and not in the thought. He writes in Categories oft 
he Temporal: “Truth and thought are connected thus: a 
thought is an act form in virtue of which an act is absolutely 
or timelessly correct (or incorrect)” (Ibid.). Speaking and 
thinking according to Rödl are necessarily temporal in that 
there are in time, in a situation. Rödl calls the sentence a 
speech act form. Generally an action form is that which 
somebody does, did, wanted to do or will never do, will do 
daily. Rödl calls it also a generic act or an act schema. The 
act here or there is distinguished from its action form, 
which is not bound to a particular time. The distinction be-
tween action and action form is not identical with the one 
of action and action description. 
Rödl thinks therefore it is important to contrast “Satz und 
Aussage”: sentence and thought.” A thought is an act 
form, the form of an act of the mind. “What someone is 
doing is not a thing to which she stands in a relation of do-
ing, but a form her doing exemplifies. Equally, what some-
one thinks is not a thing to which she stands in a relation 
of thinking, but a form her thinking exemplifies. Analo-
gously, what someone asserts is not a thing to which she 
stands in a relation of asserting, but the form of her act of 
asserting.” (Rödl, 59) 
A thought is that form of a speech act according to which 
the act can be assessed as true or false. Therefore the 
thought is true of false. Austin thinks that the act of assert-
ing itself is true or false. Rödl elaborates that it does not 
matter whether we call the act or its form true, as long as 
we bear in mind that, when we call the act true, we assess 
it solely with regard to its form. If Austin holds that state-
ments, not sentences are true or false, he does not seem 
to see that what I state, what you state or an act of stating 
has a time, place and subject.  
3. Conclusion 
In this paper I outline Rödl’s claim that a temporal logic 
underlies the a-temporal logic as a general form of 
thought. I compare this general form of thought that is the 
form of acts of the mind with Austin’s account of performa-
tives as acts of language. Rödl thinks general knowledge 
can only be gotten through a general subject, or what he 
calls a subject form, not through the particular subject. This 
is what distinguishes him from Austin who looks at utter-
ances or the uses of sentences by a particular individual. 
The claim of Rödl’s book is not only that human beings 
experience everything through categories of the temporal, 
but also that these temporal forms are the primordial logi-
cal forms: forms of human life as such.

World-Pictures in On Certainty 
Hiroshi Ohtani  
Tokyo, Japan | h_ohtani@musashino-u.ac.jp 
Abstract 
In On Certainty, Wittgenstein argues that world-pictures are things that stand fast. However, what do the sentences about them 
express? Some think that they are propositions, while others regard them as grammatical rules. In this paper, I investigate these 
two interpretations and one other alternative, and assert that all of them have serious flaws (section 2). I then argue for my 
interpretation, which affirms that they are pictures, as the name “world-picture” suggests (section 3). By citing the notion of a 
picture in Philosophical Investigations, I argue that a picture is a rough conception that is calling for a clarification, and that it is 
different from propositions or rules. In my conclusion, I respond to an objection (section 4). 
 
 
1. Introduction 
In On Certainty, Wittgenstein detects problems in making a 
knowledge-claim or in expressing a doubt about what he 
calls a world-picture (OC 93-5, 162,167, 233, 262), axis 
(OC 152), or hinge (OC 341, 343, 655). Among his exam-
ples are “Here is one hand,” which is proclaimed while 
holding one’s hand in clear view (OC 1), and “The Earth 
existed long before one’s birth” (OC 84). According to 
Wittgenstein, world-pictures cannot reasonably be said to 
be known or doubted but are things that stand fast (OC 
151, 234-5). In other words, although they are not ac-
cepted on evidential grounds, they nevertheless have ob-
jective certainty (OC 194, 270).  
The main interpretational issue in recent studies of On 
Certainty is whether the objective certainty of world-
pictures derives from our non-epistemic relation or our 
epistemic, though non-evidential, relation to them (See 
Prichard 2010, section 2-4 for a survey). However, there is 
another interesting, relatively unexplored, question con-
cerning the nature of world-pictures: What do the sen-
tences about world-pictures express? When, for example, 
a Wittgensteinian philosopher says in a lecture that the 
Earth existed long before one’s birth is a world-picture, 
what does it express? Is it a proposition, a rule or some-
thing else? (Henceforth, I call a sentence that expresses a 
world-picture “world-picture sentence.”) 
Now, before going into these questions, I would like to 
note one point. In what follows, I discuss the existence of 
the Earth long before one’s birth as representative of 
world-pictures. I admit that this is a bit dangerous because 
one of the important insights of On Certainty is that the 
class of world-pictures is not homogeneous (See Williams 
1996).1  
That the Earth existed long before one’s birth is general 
in the sense that every reasonable person in this age ac-
cepts it, but we cannot assume without argument that the 
characteristics that apply to it also apply to more situational 
ones, such as “Here is one hand,” or to personal ones, 
such as “My name is N.N” (OC 629). I believe that it is 
possible to show that the same considerations apply to 
them, with necessary modifications. However, if you are 
not convinced, you can regard my arguments as valid for 
only some of the kinds of world-pictures in On Certainty.

2. Possible Answers 
In this section, I examine three possible answers to the 
questions posed above and reject all of them. In the next 
section I then offer my own answer, which is free of the 
defects of the other alternatives. 
The first answer says that the sentence “The Earth ex-
isted long before one’s birth” expresses an empirical 
proposition (See Prichard 2010 section 3 and 4 for a dis-
cussion of this interpretation). According to this interpreta-
tion, it expresses a bipolar proposition and describes a 
state of affair. That proposition is different from ordinary 
empirical propositions in that it has a default status of 
some kind and does not require evidential support. How-
ever, the advocates of this interpretation claim, that it is still 
an empirical proposition.  
One of the problems with this interpretation is that Witt-
genstein thinks when someone asserts or denies that “the 
Earth existed long before one’s birth,” it is unclear what 
situations he or she is trying to exclude (OC 237, 461, PPF 
313). Roughly speaking, a sentence expresses an empiri-
cal proposition in that it distinguishes situations that make 
it true from those that make it false. In other words, propo-
sitions have their truth and falsehood conditions. However, 
according to Wittgenstein the truth conditions and false-
hood conditions of world-picture sentences are unclear. If 
someone says “The Earth existed long before my birth” 
and another denies it, it is very unclear what situations 
each person affirms or denies. Although a world-picture 
sentence sounds like an empirical proposition, we cannot 
identify any particular truth and falsehood condition for it. 
The second answer is that the sentence “The Earth ex-
isted long before one’s birth” expresses a rule as opposed 
to an empirical proposition (McGinn 1989, Moyal-Sharrock 
2004, and Coliva). The supporters of this interpretation 
contend that it is used for teaching or recalling the rule for 
the use of words such as “Earth” or “existed.” They think 
that the denials of world-picture sentences result in unclar-
ity because they violate grammatical rules and hence pro-
duce nonsense.  
However, although this interpretation is standard, it has a 
problem: Unclarity differs from grammatical nonsense. For 
to say that denying a world-picture sentence results in un-
clarity, rather than grammatical nonsense, leaves open the 
possibility of obtaining clarity and hence understanding it in 
the future. In fact Wittgenstein remains open, writing “I 
cannot at present imagine a reasonable doubt as to the 
existence of the earth during the last 100 years” (OC 261). 
Here Wittgenstein says “at present (jetzt)” (See also “so far 
(noch)” in OC 247). He thinks that a doubt about world-

pictures is unclear because at present we do not have 
forms of life that make it intelligible, but he admits the pos-
sibility that in the future we do understand it.
2 
Now it may be objected that if doubt about or a denial of 
world-pictures becomes intelligible, then a new language 
game with new rules exists, and what Wittgenstein admits 
is just the possibility of new games. Danièle Moyal-
Sharrock, a prominent supporter of the rule interpretation, 
contends that even when world-pictures seem to be 
doubted in a new situation, the same rules are not in 
doubt. According to her, rules are never put in an epis-
temic context, and what is common to both situations is 
only the sentence (Moyal-Sharrock 2004, 140-1). 
Although this is the best possible defense of the rule in-
terpretation, it still has a serious problem: It is making 
prophesies that Wittgenstein tries to avoid. 
“Do I know or do I believe…?” might also be expressed 
like this: What if it seemed to turn out that what until 
now has seemed immune to doubt was a false assump-
tion? Would I react as I do when a belief has proved to 
be false? or would it seem to knock from under my feet 
the ground on which I stand in making any judgments at 
all? – But of course I do not intend this as a prophecy. 
(OC 492) 
According to Wittgenstein, it is not a philosopher’s busi-
ness to prophesize about how we will react in a presently 
unimaginable situation. If one pre-empts future situations 
and says that a situation in which we can meaningfully say 
that “I doubt that the Earth existed long before my birth” is 
one in which different language games are practiced, one 
engages in prophecy. A hundred years ago, a philosopher 
might have legitimately said, “That a woman who bears a 
person in her womb is that person’s mother is absolutely 
certain. If someone doubts this, he or she either does not 
understand the meaning of those words or has started a 
new game.” However, if someone today says, “I doubt if 
that woman who has borne John is his mother,” the con-
clusion is not inevitable that he or she has changed the 
meaning of, say, “mother.” How changes in technology 
and our lives might affect our ideas cannot be judged by 
pure philosophical reflections on “grammar.” 3 
The third answer is the sentence in question is plain 
nonsense. This is the projection of the so-called resolute 
reading of Tractatus to On Certainty. According to this in-
terpretation, speaking of a world-picture sentence fails to 
constitute a speech act and hence is a plain noise. My ob-
jection to this is simple: Wittgenstein does not regard it as 
nonsense but uses the name “world-picture.” What we 
can’t say, we can’t name.  Therefore, the straightforward 
projection of resolute reading to the notion of a world-
picture cannot be correct.

3. World-Pictures as Pictures 
In the previous section, I argued against three possible 
answers to my question. The argument shows that the cor-
rect answer must (i) explain the unclarity, (ii) avoid a 
prophecy, and (iii) not make world-picture sentences into 
plain nonsense. The answer that satisfies these three crite-
ria, I propose, is that world-picture sentences express “pic-
tures” as the name “world-picture” suggests. Now, I explain 
                                                      
2 Wittgenstein’s concern is almost always unclarity and never grammatical 
nonsense. See especially OC 4, 347-50, 481. 
3 Compare with Moyal-Sharrock’s argument about a similar example (Moyal-
Sharrock 2004, 141-2). 
4 I do not imply any resolute reader ever makes such a straightforward projec-
tion. See Conant (1998) for a resolute reader’s interpretation of On Certainty. 
the notion of picture in later Wittgenstein and then argue 
for the application of it to the notion of world-picture.
5 
In the opening remarks of Philosophical Investigations, in 
which Wittgenstein investigates the so-called the Augustin-
ian Picture, he talks about “the particular picture of the es-
sence of human language.” He says that the picture is “the 
words in language name objects – sentences are combi-
nations of such names (PI 1),” and he contrasts it with the 
philosophical “idea” about meaning (PI 1). Wittgenstein’s 
argument in these opening remarks can be reconstructed 
as depicting the two-step process of being caught in a phi-
losophical picture (See also PI 308). First, we say the sen-
tence “the words in language name objects – sentences 
are combinations of such names,” remaining open to the 
interpretation of words, (“name” for example), contained in 
it. At this point, the picture that is constituted by the sen-
tence gives a rough conception in the sense that it invites 
us to interpret it in various ways (Cf. Kuusela 2008, 36). 
However, as a second step, we impose a particular model 
on the interpretation of words in the picture. For example, 
we think of names of medium sized objects such as the 
names of people or nouns like “table,” and make them a 
model by which the word “name” should be interpreted. 
Although Wittgenstein sometimes calls this model in the 
second step a “picture” (OC 305), here I will call the rough 
conception constituted by the words in the first step a “pic-
ture” because it gives a clear understanding of Wittgen-
stein’s thoughts on pictures.6 
To cut a long story short, Wittgenstein’s treatment of phi-
losophical pictures is as follows: A picture is originally a 
rough conception that invites us to various interpretations. 
It is a call for a clarification, so to speak. However, by im-
posing a model we make it a standard to which everything 
accords. By responding to the original calling and suggest-
ing various alternative ways of clearing up the picture, 
Wittgenstein investigates whether it is worth committing to 
the picture in question. 
A world-picture such as “the Earth existed long before 
one’s birth” is a picture in the sense explained above. It 
expresses our ways of living in which, say, historical inves-
tigations take place. We can track the apparent logic of the 
picture. For example, we can say that the denial of the pic-
ture results in the denial of historical evidence about Napo-
leon (OC 183). However, we cannot say what form that 
“denial of the existence” takes, so that the picture gives 
only a rough conception. Now, it is easy to see that my in-
terpretation satisfies the three criteria suggested above. 
First, a world-picture is a picture and gives no specific truth 
condition (i). Second, it is an open possibility that a picture 
is cleared in a way that doubt about it becomes intelligible 
in the future. A doubt about it might become clearly under-
standable in the future because the changes of our forms 
of life might give us a way to make it intelligible. What is 
more, there is nothing in the notion of picture that forces us 
to say a doubt about a picture in the new situation results 
in a change of meaning of words or language games. 
Therefore, we avoid prophecy (ii). Finally, pictures consti-
tutes a unique kind that is different from propositions or 
rules, hence they are not plain nonsense either (iii). 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, I consider one objection. It asserts that there 
is no sufficient textual support for my interpretation: it is 
                                                      
5 Here I am concerned only with what David Eagan calls a “conceptual pic-
ture” (Eagan 2011). 
6 It is also in line with Wittgenstein’s remarks in which he identifies a picture 
with words themselves. See PI 222, 295, PPF 55.

based on just the phrase “world-picture,” which, after all, 
appears only eight times in On Certainty.  
As a response, I mention three points. First, my interpre-
tation coheres with Wittgenstein’s thought in On Certainty, 
while the other alternatives have serious flaws, as shown 
above. Second, my interpretation not only follows Wittgen-
stein’s thought, but it also depends on his notion of picture 
in Philosophical Investigations. I have not coined a new 
notion that is alien to Wittgenstein’s philosophy. Third, 
there is, however, something true in the objection: Witt-
genstein does not explicitly develop the notion of picture in 
On Certainty. In my view, he could not elaborate the point 
in question. In the early part of On Certainty, he regards 
world-picture sentences as propositions (OC 136). How-
ever, as his thoughts develop, he shows hesitations (OC 
213-5, 308, 401-2), but he never reflects on the point. 
Therefore, my interpretation does not present what Witt-
genstein actually said but what he should have said, if he 
had had time to elaborate on the question.

Strukturelle Eigenschaften der Textform „Bemerkung“, 
exemplarisch gezeigt am „Philosophie-Kapitel“ (§89-§133) der 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen

Abstract 
Dieser Beitrag ist ein Versuch, die Textform der „Bemerkung“ strukturell abzugrenzen gegen andere Formen der philosophi-
schen Miniaturprosa wie Aphorismus oder (romantisches) Fragment. Eine „Bemerkung“ ist sowohl abgeschlossen als auch of-
fen, und steht in einer linearen Konstellation mit anderen Bemerkungen. Somit konstituiert sich die strukturelle Besonderheit 
einer „Bemerkung“ hauptsächlich in zwei Aspekten: Nämlich in 1) bemerkungsinternen Strukturen mit einem meist lokalen Wir-
kungsspektrum (Mehrstimmigkeit, Ton, Lesebetonung, Literarizität, Performativität usw.) und 2) ihrem facettenreichen Verwei-
sungspotential zu ihrem Kotext, d.h. zu anderen Bemerkungen. Diese Verknüpfungsmöglichkeit auf argumentativen, rhetori-
schen und stilistischen Ebenen baut sich zwar auf der Grundlage der bemerkungsinternen Strukturen auf; scheint jedoch der 
Textform der Bemerkung dennoch inhärent zu sein. Das Ziel des Beitrags besteht darin, anhand der formal-textinternen sowie 
textgenetischen „Mikroanalyse“ des „Philosophie-Kapitels eine Reflexion über Wittgensteins metaphilosophisches Konzept zu 
entwickeln. 
 
 
Strukturelle Eigenschaften der Textform 
„Bemerkungen“ 1 
Die formale Besonderheit der Textform „Bemerkungen“ in 
den Philosophischen Untersuchungen besteht zuerst in 
zwei scheinbar trivialen Fakten: Eine Bemerkung ist eine 
abgeschlossene Texteinheit, sie hat also einen markierten 
Anfang und ein markiertes Ende.
2 Diese Markierung ist in 
den Philosophischen Untersuchungen allein durch die 
Nummerierung gegeben, und insofern anders als in TS 
213 (sog. „Big Typescript“) und anderen Manuskrip-
ten/Typoskripten, in denen eine oder mehrere Freizeilen 
zur Trennung von Bemerkungen verwendet werden.
3 Die 
zweite formale Eigenschaft einer Bemerkung in den Philo-
sophischen Untersuchungen ist, dass sie zwei Nachbar-
bemerkungen besitzt (im Falle der Anfangs-und Schluss-
bemerkung selbstverständlich nur eine Nachbarbemer-
kung), so befindet sich eine Bemerkung immer unaus-
weichlich in einer linearen Gesamtordnung, die aus weite-
ren Bemerkungen besteht.  
Abgeschlossenheit: Es ist eine höchst relevante Ei-
genschaft der betroffenen Textform, dass eine Bemerkung 
dank ihrer Abgrenzung durch Nummerierung prinzipiell 
abgeschlossen für sich allein betrachtet werden kann, 
auch wenn eine solche isolierte Betrachtung in vielen Fäl-
len nicht zu einem ausschöpfenden Verständnis des Tex-
tes führt. Diese Abgeschlossenheit und somit das Ge-
trenntsein von den Nachbarbemerkungen ermöglicht, dass 
eine inhomogene, bruchstückhaft gestaltete Bemerkungs-
landschaft zustande kommen kann. Ein rascher Wechsel 
                                                      
1 Der vorliegende Beitrag ist als Zusammenfassung meiner Magisterarbeit zu 
verstehen, nämlich: „Wittgensteins Philosophieren und dessen Darstellungs-
form als 'Bemerkungen'. Eine philologisch-philosophische Studie zu §89-§133 
der Philosophischen Untersuchungen“, vorgelegt am 14.4.2011 an der LMU. 
Hier können nur der methodische Ansatz sowie die wichtigsten Ergebnisse 
dargestellt werden, die eigentliche Textanalyse beinhaltet in Form eines 
Kommentars formale, inhaltliche und textgenetische Untersuchungen für jede 
Subsektion (Absatz) in §89-§133. 
2 Selbstverständlich gibt es keinen Text ohne Anfang/Ende. Die Relevanz 
dieser Eigenschaft wird also hier hergestellt durch die besonders feinmaschige 
Markierung innerhalb eines Textkorpus.  
3 Für gewöhnlich eine Freizeile; Ausnahmen bilden die Arbeitsstadien der 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen (MS 142, TS 220, TS 239, TS 227), und die 
ersten Seiten des MS 117 (bis Seite 19), die keine Freizeile haben. Eine Be-
merkungstrennung durch zwei Freizeilen kommt beispielsweise in MS 116 vor. 
Manuskripte, die zum Zerschneiden gedacht sind, haben manchmal noch 
größere Zeilenabstände, beispielsweise TS 221. 
hinsichtlich Themata, Ton und Stil kann auf diese Weise 
viel müheloser erfolgen. Auf die formalen Strukturen, die in 
einer Bemerkung aufgebaut und genutzt wurden, muss in 
der nächsten Bemerkung nicht zurückgegriffen werden. 
Diese Möglichkeit der abrupten Ablösung aus den stilisti-
schen und semantischen Zusammenhängen der vorange-
henden Bemerkung ist eine notwendige Bedingung dafür, 
dass sich klar voneinander unterscheidbare Bemerkungs-
typen mit je verschiedenen Funktionen innerhalb eines 
Textganzen konstituieren können. 
Die „Vereinzelung“ durch das Format der Bemerkungen 
bewirkt aber andererseits auch, dass das Spektrum des 
Lesefokus in der Regel verstärkt auf eine Einzelbemer-
kung begrenzt wird – vorangehende oder nachfolgende 
Bemerkungen werden großzügig ausgeblendet oder nur 
indirekt thematisiert (sowie man andere Gedanken aus-
blendet, sobald man einen bestimmten Gedanken hat). 
Der Lesefokus und der Umfang des zu einem Zeitpunkt 
thematisierten Inhalts kann auf diese Weise äußerst genau 
kontrolliert werden, im Vergleich zu einem „normalen“ 
Fließtext. Die Abgeschlossenheit wird somit zur rhetori-
schen Vorbedingung, um in die wirkungsästhetische Di-
mension der Lektüre direkt eingreifen zu können.  
Offenheit: Die Bemerkungen der Philosophischen Un-
tersuchungen zeichnen sich fernerhin durch ihre Offenheit 
trotz Abgeschlossenheit aus. Eine Bemerkung ist in dem 
Sinne offen, dass neben bemerkungsinternen auch be-
merkungsübergreifende Strukturen existieren können, die 
über die Abgeschlossenheit einer Einzelbemerkung hi-
nausweisen. Eine Bemerkung kann auf viele verschiedene 
Weisen mit anderen Bemerkungen verbunden sein, im 
Wesentlichen kann man zwei Arten solcher Verknüpfun-
gen unterscheiden. a) Explizite Verbindungen entstehen 
dadurch, dass gewisse Formelemente einer Bemerkung 
ausschließlich für Herstellung einer Verbindung zu ande-
ren Bemerkungen verwendetet werden. Hierzu gehören 
die namentliche Erwähnung einer anderen Bemerkung 
oder die eindeutige Weiterführung eines Argumentations-
strangs. Wesentlich für eine explizite Verbindung ist, dass 
diejenigen Formelemente, die die Verbindung konstituie-
ren, außerhalb des Verweiszusammenhanges keine Be-
deutung haben. Wenn z.B. §92 mit dem Demonstrativpro-
nomen „[d]ies“ beginnt, so muss der Sinn dieses Form-
elements außerhalb der Bemerkung gesucht werden. b)

Implizite Verbindungen kommen dadurch zustande, dass 
sich bestimmte bemerkungsinterne Formmerkmale in meh-
reren Bemerkungen wiederholen, weiterentwickelt werden 
oder sich gegenseitig nachahmen. Das beste Beispiel für 
diesen Fall ist ein semantisches/isotopisches Feld, das 
bemerkungsübergreifend aufgebaut wird. Eine weitere Va-
riante ist die Formnachahmung, welche gewisse rhetori-
sche Elemente aufnimmt, um eine argumentative Verbin-
dung herzustellen, oder in plastischer Weise parodiert, um 
einen ironisierenden Effekt auszulösen. Es ist wesentlich 
für eine implizite Verbindung, dass sie auf bemerkungsin-
terne Strukturen basiert, die unabhängig von externen 
Verbindungen wirken, und primär eine andere rhetorische 
Funktion innerhalb der Bemerkung ausübt. 
Diese ständige Verbundenheit zu anderen Bemerkungen 
zeichnet die Bemerkungen der Philosophischen Untersu-
chungen vor anderen literaturhistorischen Gattungen wie 
z.B. Aphorismen oder Maximen aus, und gibt ihnen eine 
sekundäre, nichttriviale Eigenschaft der Ordnung.
 4 
Ordnung: Unter Ordnung soll in diesem Zusammenhang 
zweierlei verstanden werden: Die primäre Ordnungsstruk-
tur ist durch die lineare Anordnung der Bemerkungen ge-
geben, d.h. durch die faktische Reihenfolge der Bemer-
kungen im Skript.
5 Diese Struktur rührt trivialerweise von 
der Tatsache her, dass die Bemerkungen von Wittgenstein 
in eine physische Anordnung gebracht wurden, welche der 
eindimensionalen Struktur eines Textes folgt. Die sekundä-
re Ordnung konstituiert sich dagegen durch die oben er-
wähnten bemerkungsübergreifenden Verbindungen; diese 
nenne ich auch die kontextuelle Ordnung, da sich die se-
kundäre Ordnung nur kontextuell bestimmen lässt (es gibt 
diesbezüglich keine „harten“, d.h. physische Fakten). 
Wenn man annimmt, dass die primäre Anordnung eine 
nichtzufällige, d.h. eine „sinnvolle“ Konstellation darstellt, 
muss man nach dem globalen Zusammenhang zwischen 
der primären und sekundären Ordnung suchen. D.h. man 
muss im Idealfall für jede primäre Ordnungsrelation ent-
sprechende sekundäre Relationen angeben können, denn 
sonst bleibt die primäre Anordnung ohne kontextuellen 
Sinn. Dies heißt erstens, dass man Klarheit darüber er-
langt, aus welchen rhetorischen Gründen eine Bemerkung 
an einem bestimmten Ort innerhalb der linearen Anord-
nung steht, und warum sie auf die spezifische Weise mit 
anderen Bemerkungen verknüpft ist. Zweitens aber ge-
winnt man damit Einblick in die Struktur der philosophi-
schen Gedankenlandschaft, die dargestellt wird. Die 
mehrdimensional miteinander verknüpften Bemerkungen 
können als ein Abbild des ebenfalls in sich mehrdimensio-
nalen verschachtelten Problemgebietes gedeutet werden. 
Inhomogene Verteilung der Formelemente 
im „Philosophie-Kapitel“ 
Um die textuellen Strukturen in den betroffenen Bemer-
kungen angemessen zu charakterisieren, werden variie-
rende Kategorien verwendet. Für die Analyse textinterner 
Strukturen sollten folgende Parameter in Betrachtung ge-
                                                      
4 Es wäre gewiss falsch zu behaupten, dass sich in deutschsprachiger Apho-
rismen-, Fragmenten-, und Maximenliteratur überhaupt keine Ordnungsstruk-
turen vorfinden (so ist z.B. die Anordnung der „Blüthenstaub-Fragmente“ eine 
von Novalis selbst gewählte Darstellungsform). Aber die kontextuelle Verbin-
dung zwischen den Miniaturtexten ist bei keiner herkömmlichen Gattung so 
intensiv und vielschichtig wie in den Philosophischen Untersuchungen.  
5 Es ist im Falle der Philosophischen Untersuchungen z.T. äußerst schwer, 
diese lineare Ordnung eindeutig festzulegen, da Unklarheit darüber herrscht, 
wie manche Zetteleinschübe zwischen den Typoskriptseiten zu interpretieren 
sind. Aber sofern Wittgenstein ein „Buch“ intendiert hatte (Vorwort zu den 
Philosophischen Untersuchungen), muss er auch eine lineare Ordnung ange-
strebt haben, und unklare Fälle können hinsichtlich dieses Schreibideals igno-
riert werden. 
zogen werden: Argumentationsstrategie, Ton, Isotopie 
bzw. semantisches Feld, Mehrstimmigkeit, Performativität, 
Literarizität und Intertextualität. Aus Seitengründen genaue 
Ausführung der Kategorien sowie die eigentliche Detail-
analyse in Kommentarform müssen hier ausgelassen wer-
den.  
In den Bemerkungen §89-§133 ist ein deutliches Un-
gleichgewicht in der Verteilung der Formmerkmale festzu-
stellen. Dies bedeutet vor allem, dass ihr Wirkungsbereich 
lokal beschränkt zu sein scheint. Rhetorisch-stilistische 
Strukturen werden rasch aufgebaut, oft innerhalb einer 
einzigen Bemerkung, um im Übergang zur nächsten Be-
merkung wieder abgebaut zu werden. Im Folgenden sollen 
hervorstehende Besonderheiten in der Landschaft der 
Formmerkmale, d.h. paradigmatische Ungleichgewichtsfäl-
le, aufgelistet werden. 
a) Es wird ein extrem dicht besetztes semantisches Feld 
in §89-§110 aufgebaut. Dieses konzentriert sich haupt-
sächlich auf die Charakterisierung der „alten“ Vorstellung 
der Logik als eine Täuschung, nämlich als ein Ideal, das 
den Philosophierenden „blendet“ (§100). Die konstitutiven 
Wörter sind in hohem Maße bilderbeladen und literarisch, 
man denke an Metaphern wie „Chimäre“ (§94), „Nimbus“ 
(§97), „Kristall“ (§97), „Spinnennetz“ (§106), „Glatteis“ 
(§107) oder „Verhexung“ (§108). Die Wirkung des hier er-
zeugten semantischen Feldes klingt zwar bis in §116 
nach, aber verliert immer mehr an Kraft gegen Ende des 
„Kapitels“. Die Bemerkungen §117-§129 weisen im Ge-
gensatz zu §89-§109 kein bemerkungsübergreifendes se-
mantisches Feld auf; manche Einzelbemerkungen zeugen 
zwar von hoch konzentrierten Bildern und metaphorischer 
Sprache, aber ihre Wirkung bleibt nahezu immer lokal.  
b) Das Phänomen der Mehrstimmigkeit ist ein Haupt-
element bis §120, die Dialog- bzw. Gesprächsstruktur der 
Stimmen leistet einen wesentlichen Beitrag zum dialekti-
schen Aufbau der Bemerkungen. Konkret wird die Mehr-
stimmigkeit durch Techniken wie Scheinzitate mit Anfüh-
rungszeichen (§93-§95, §99-§100, §112-§114, §117) 
Stimmenwechsel mit Gedankenstrich (§99, §101, §108) 
und die ungewöhnliche Verwendung von Personalprono-
mina (§100) hergestellt. Mehrstimmigkeit tritt in den Be-
merkungen nach §121 allerdings praktisch nicht mehr auf, 
den genannten Markierungen für Mehrstimmigkeit kom-
men ausschließlich andere Funktionen zu. In den letzten 
13 Bemerkungen schrumpft das mehrstimmige Gespräch 
auf diese Weise zu einem Monolog zusammen. 
c) Die eben charakterisierte Monologisierung der Stimme 
in der zweiten Hälfte des „Kapitels“ bewirkt eine Verein-
heitlichung im Ton, sodass der Ton dogmatischer und be-
lehrender wird. Das Fehlen des philosophischen Gegen-
übers bedeutet, dass mögliche Einwände oder Gegenar-
gumente nicht in der Unmittelbarkeit berücksichtigt und 
diskutiert werden, wie es in den mehrstimmig konzipierten 
Bemerkungen möglich war. Es heißt aber auch, dass es 
viel leichter ist, verallgemeinernde Grundsätze und pro-
grammatische Ansichten über „die“ Philosophie zu formu-
lieren. Die generalisierenden Thesen müssen nicht vertei-
digt werden, weil das kritische Publikum fehlt. Der Ton in 
Bemerkungen §89-§120 bildet dagegen die inneren Span-
nung, oder den intellektuell-ethischen Kampf des Philoso-
phierenden ab. Der unmissverständlich fordernde, befeh-
lende Ton in „[z]urück auf den rauhen Boden!“ (§107), üb-
rigens der einzige Imperativ des „Kapitels“, fungiert als ein 
tonales Bild für eine gegen Täuschungen kämpfende bzw. 
dem Ideal trotzende Geisteshaltung; die Philosophie ist 
eben ein Kampf gegen die Verhexung des Verstandes 
(§109).

Die Lokalität des Wirkungsspektrums der 
bemerkungsinternen Strukturen 
Die Analyse zeigt auch, dass die stilistisch-rhetorischen 
Effekte, die durch bemerkungsinterne Strukturen erzeugt 
werden, in vielen Fällen nicht über die betroffenen Bemer-
kungen hinausgehen. Das Wirkungsspektrum eines Form-
elements bleibt in der Regel lokal auf eine Bemerkung 
oder auf Bemerkungsteile beschränkt. Die Struktur Lese-
betonung beispielsweise hat ein extrem schmales Wir-
kungsspektrum, denn rein formal betrachtet versetzt sie 
nur das semantische Gewicht einzelner Wörter. Ähnlich 
verhält es sich mit Elementen wie Performativität, deren 
Wirkung auch zeitlich begrenzt ist; außerhalb des perfor-
mativen Satzes wird per Definition nichts mehr performiert. 
Dies heißt vor allem, dass Bemerkungen des „Philosophie-
Kapitels“ 
in 
mehreren 
Hinsichten 
rhetorisch-
rezeptionsästhetisch in sich geschlossene Texteinheiten 
darstellen.  
Solche lokale Konzentrationen von bestimmten Form-
merkmalen und funktionalen Zusammenhängen machen 
das methodische Vorgehen plausibel, verschiedene Kate-
gorien für Bemerkungsart innerhalb des „Philosophie-
Kapitels“ anzulegen – etwa dialektische und dogmatische, 
literarische und sachliche, polemische und neutrale Be-
merkungen. Und die Art einer Bemerkung hängt in diesem 
Sinne von ihrer rhetorischen Funktion ab: Zwei Bemerkun-
gen, die inhaltlich von demselben Thema handeln, können 
trotzdem zwei einander entgegensetzten Kategorien an-
gehören und dem Redegegenstand jeweils einen anderen 
Ort im Diskursuniversum zuweisen. Beispielsweise behan-
deln §109 und §124 beide das Thema der rein deskripti-
ven Natur der Philosophie. Was mit Hilfe von §109 präven-
tiv aus dem Weg geräumt wird, ist die Gefahr, dass die 
klare Formulierung in §124 in ein philosophisches Dogma 
entartet. Es ist also eine deutliche Aufgabenteilung sicht-
bar, obwohl §109 und §124 sich in demselben themati-
schen Gebiet befinden. Solche Differenzen in der Funktio-
nalität der Bemerkungen trotz gleichbleibenden Themas 
lassen vermuten, dass die Bemerkungen des „Philoso-
phie-Kapitels“ als ein argumentatives Ganzes komponiert 
wurden. In diesem Sinne hängt die Bedeutung bzw. Funk-
tion einer Bemerkung vom Gesamtkontext anderer Bemer-
kungen ab, und die Abgeschlossenheit der Bemerkungen 
wird zur Vorbedingung für eine Komposition zu einer bun-
ten textuellen Landschaft, die „der Natur des Gegenstan-
des“ angemessen ist.  
Zwei Arten von Bemerkungsübergängen 
Doch nicht nur die funktional-formale Eigenart einer Be-
merkung als abgeschlossene Texteinheit ist von Interesse, 
sondern auch ihre Wirkung auf die Art des Übergangs zur 
nächsten Bemerkung (d.h. zu ihrem linearen Nachfolger). 
Dieser Punkt wurde in der Analyse unter Bemerkungs-
übergang behandelt. Aus der Detailanalyse geht hervor, 
dass der Grad der Linearität, die im ungebrochenen Fluss 
der Argumentation, in der Kohärenz der Isotopien, des 
Tons usw. besteht, je nach Bemerkungsübergang variiert. 
Manche Bemerkungen weisen eindeutig stärkere Verbin-
dungen zu ihren linearen Nachfolgern auf als andere.  
a) Die Bemerkungen §89-§110 bilden eine stark durch-
komponierte Sequenz mit einem massiven inneren Zu-
sammenhalt. Diese Bemerkungssequenz ist die Diskussi-
on eines breiten, aber dennoch zusammenhängenden 
Themengebiets. Dieser thematische Raum besteht aus 
eng verwandten, ineinander zusammenhängenden Ge-
genständen: Sublimität der Logik (§89-§92), metaphysi-
sche Versuchung hinsichtlich Satz/Denken (§93-§97), Be-
stimmtheit des Sinnes damit verbundenes Ideal (§98-
§104), die Behandlung des Ideals (§105-§107) und 
schließlich das neue, rein deskriptive Programm in der Phi-
losophie (§108-§110). Die Argumentation von einem The-
ma zum nächsten verläuft dabei relativ fließend. Tonale 
Brüche sind zwar oft sichtbar bei einem Themenwechsel, 
beispielsweise wie im Bemerkungsübergang §97/§98, je-
doch ein völlig aphoristischer Bruch wird durch das kräftige 
semantische Feld verhindert.  
Das wichtigste Merkmal solcher Bemerkungen ist, dass 
eine Einzelbemerkung nicht ihren vollen Sinn offenbaren 
kann, wenn sie außerhalb des linearen Kontextes betrach-
tet wird. Die Bedeutung und Funktion dieser Bemerkungen 
sind immer zu einem großen Teil an die lineare Anordnung 
gebunden, in der sie sich befinden. Dies wird sehr deut-
lich, wenn man das Einsetzen von „Scheinreferenzen“ auf 
andere Bemerkungen untersucht. Man kann beispielswei-
se das Demonstrativpronomen „[d]ies“ am Anfang von §92 
betrachten. Dieser Verweis hat kein eindeutiges Referenz-
objekt und schafft keinen expliziten Bezug zu einem be-
stimmten Kontext. Der Leser mag selbst herausfinden, wo 
der gemeinte Kontext ist, oder der Kontext kann vielleicht 
gar nicht angegeben werden; was dagegen sicher ist, dass 
hier überhaupt eine markierte Referenz vorhanden ist. 
Man kann eine Scheinreferenz dieser Art als ein Signal 
dafür lesen, dass die betreffende Bemerkung nicht apho-
ristisch, sondern im Kontext zu lesen ist. 
b) Die Sequenz §116-§129 hingegen besteht aus lose 
miteinander verbundenen Bemerkungen, die zum Teil wie 
Aphorismen im traditionellen Sinne wirken. Die Kontinuität 
hinsichtlich der argumentativen, stilistischen und rhetori-
schen Faktoren tritt hier zurück; es gibt weniger Struktu-
ren, die bemerkungsübergreifend wirken, und so geschieht 
der Übergang von einem Thema zum nächsten oft abrupt 
und unvorbereitet. Extremfälle für aphoristische Bemer-
kungsübergänge stellen die Übergänge von und zu §123, 
§127 und §128 dar. Diese drei Bemerkungen bestehen 
alle aus einem einzigen Satz. Ihr hervorstechendes Merk-
mal liegt im Fehlen von Verbindungen zu benachbarten 
Bemerkungen, sie zeichnen sich durch eine besondere 
Abgeschlossenheit aus und können einen Bruch im Argu-
mentationsfluss bewirken.  
Fazit der Analyse 
Diese Analyse zeigt, dass sowohl die Intensität der Form-
strukturen als auch die Dichte der Verbindungen zwischen 
den Bemerkungen mit einer beachtenswerten Genauigkeit 
kontrolliert werden. Die Textform „Bemerkung“ ist derart 
konzipiert, dass die formalen Elemente, die für die Darstel-
lung des Gegenstandes konstitutiv sind, je nach Bedarf 
ein- und ausgeblendet werden können. Die Fragmentie-
rung Textes in Einzelbemerkung ermöglicht die minuziöse 
Kontrolle der rhetorischen Wirkung, die in einem gewähl-
ten Textabschnitt beabsichtigt ist. Somit gewinnt die Dar-
stellungsform des „Philosophie-Kapitels“ die Flexibilität, 
sich der inhomogenen Landschaft der philosophischen 
Probleme anzupassen.   Die Textform der Bemerkungen 
ist das schriftstellerische Instrument, mit dessen Hilfe Witt-
genstein philosophiert hat. In §89-§133 findet man eine 
der ausgereiftesten Anwendung dieser Technik, in mehre-
ren Hinsichten divergierende Bemerkungen zu einem 
sinnvollen Ganzen zu komponieren.  Entgegen den Vorur-
teilen, im „Schreiben in Bemerkungen“ eine schriftstelleri-
sche Schwäche zu sehen, oder die Darstellungsform in 
Bemerkungen als eine „freie“ Textform wie Aphorismen im 
traditionellen Sinne interpretieren zu wollen, erweisen sich 
die Bemerkungen §89-§133 durch ihre Vielschichtigkeit 
und minuziös angelegte rhetorische Wirkungsstruktur als

From Analysis to Morphology. Contribution to Investigations into 
Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Method 
Michał Piekarski 
Warsaw, Poland | m.piekarski@uksw.edu.pl 
Abstract 
The article discusses the problem of the unity of Wittgenstein’s philosophy. The author suggests that Wittgenstein uses different 
methods of inquiring. The modifications of his philosophy are correlated with modifications of his method of thinking and investi-
gations. In Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus the only correct philosophical method is that of logical analysis of propositions. In 
early 30s his philosophy becomes a phenomenological description of experience. The task is to construct phenomenological 
language. After 1933 Wittgenstein recognizes the grammatical dimension of language, and creates tools of grammatical analy-
sis. He introduces concepts of language- games and forms of life. His philosophy becomes the morphology and description of 
human linguistic practice. 
 
 
It is common to believe that Wittgenstein applied two phi-
losophical methods. One is associated with his Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus and linked to the method of logical 
analysis as espoused by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Rus-
sell, whereas the other stems from Philosophical Investiga-
tions and the theory of language-games. Explained like 
this, the two methods contradict each other. Analysis is 
something complete, concerns meaningful (i.e. true or 
false) language and produces elementary or simple propo-
sitions. The method of language-games, on the other 
hand, refers to language as a set of linguistic practices, 
tackles every kind of expression and is related not so 
much to the semantics or syntax of language as to its 
pragmatics. In spite of being common and popular, this 
opinion does not give justice what is the most characteris-
tic for Wittgenstein’s method. 
The Analytical Period 
In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein made the fundamental dis-
tinction between saying and showing. What is said by a 
proposition is its content, whereas what the proposition 
shows are its formal properties which Wittgenstein calls 
internal. On the one hand, what can be seen is related to 
formal properties of language – on the other, it shows the 
sense of a specific proposition (TLP 4.022).
1 Wittgenstein 
said that we need to differentiate between semantic no-
tions such as “Socrates” or “mortality” and notions of a 
formal or, we could say, categorial nature such as “object” 
or “thing”. The latter reveal themselves as conditions for 
the former. In order to say something about Socrates, for 
example “Socrates is mortal”, we must already have the 
category of object and the category of property, or, in the 
semantic version – the category of subject and predicate. 
The fact that something is an object reveals itself in that 
the name may be introduced as a value of a certain vari-
able. The proposition “Socrates is mortal” says that Socra-
tes is mortal, nothing more, nothing less. According to 
Wittgenstein one cannot say it and “make sense” but it can 
be seen. 
Logical analysis is necessary because it makes it easier 
to see how signs are connected to one another. A logical 
proposition like (Ǝx)x does not say anything about an ob-
ject, but only shows the allocation of certain symbols.  
                                                      
1 “The proposition shows its sense. The proposition shows how things stand, if 
it is true. And it says, that they do so stand.” (TLF 4.022). 
This brings us to the core of the Tractarian theory of 
logic – the theory of tautology. At the climax of his argu-
ment, Wittgenstein states that tautologies and contradic-
tions do not say anything. If there were able to express 
something, this would mean that they could be brought 
down to something through analysis and so they won't to 
be tautologies or contradictions. They do not say anything 
because they are not propositions. A proposition which is 
always true or always false does not make sense. Accord-
ing to Wittgenstein, tautologies are rules for combining 
signs. 
So what does tautology show? Why is seeing the es-
sence of Wittgenstein’s method? Propositions of logic 
show (reveal) the formal—logical—properties of language 
and the world (UM, p. 175, TLP 6.12). They show so they 
do not speak. This means that one can, as it were, infer 
the thing that they express from their appearance. Tautol-
ogy is a specific combination of signs brought about by 
means of certain relationships represented by logical op-
erators2. This combination constitutes a structure whose 
constituent parts have “definite properties of structure” 
(TLP 6.12). Hence, tautologies are conditional on develop-
ing configurations of constituents having their own logic. 
What kind of logic of constituents is at stake here? The 
answer is to be found in proposition 6.124: tautologies 
presuppose that: 
"names have meaning, and that elementary proposi-
tions have sense. And this is their connection with the 
world. It is clear that it must show something about the 
world that certain combinations of symbols—which es-
sentially have a definite character—are tautologies. (…) 
this means that in logic it is not we who express, by 
means of signs, what we want, but in logic the nature of 
the essentially necessary signs itself asserts". 
What is important in tautology are not signs which already 
have their internal logic, but their combinations which ex-
press a truth about the world. Because elementary propo-
sitions may be combined into a tautology, tautology, as a 
possible and, also, necessary combination of the proposi-
tions, reveals logical properties of the world (TLP 6.12). 
Hence, logical analysis is only a tool making seeing pos-
sible. However, if we want to understand fully the nature of 
seeing, we must consider the problem of the subject who 
“sees”. On the basis of some remarks from the Tractatus,

we may assume that it is some kind of transcendental sub-
ject, albeit Wittgenstein does not say so directly. 
The Phenomenological Period 
In 1929 Wittgenstein revised his position from the Trac-
tatus and he wrote: “If, now, we try to get at an actual 
analysis, we find logical forms which have very little simi-
larity with the norms of ordinary language” (RLF 165).  
The object of philosophy is to construct a “phenomenol-
ogical language”, that is a language which is supposed to 
offer a direct description of experience (unmittelbare Erfah-
rung) (PB, p. 1), what is directly given (Hintikka 1996, 55; 
Stern 1995, 99). What is given directly? Wittgenstein did 
not answer the question unequivocally.  
Wittgenstein was inclined to subscribe to ideas put for-
ward by positivists, especially Mach. According to Mach, 
reality is a river of impressions, sensual data, and experi-
ences which are not given as something constant and rela-
tively stable, but as a chaotic and unordered structure. In a 
sense, reality is reduced to fleeting impressions which only 
become determined and shaped in language (MS, p. 107, 
158-159). It is reduced to space which Wittgenstein under-
stands very broadly as a combination of the visual, taste 
and kinaesthetic space (MS, p. 107, 3). 
This brings us back to the problem of seeing. The incon-
gruity between logical forms of language and the forms of 
phenomena (Phänomenon) led Wittgenstein to some con-
clusions on the phenomenological structure of space. 
Space, said Wittgenstein, exists in time and changes with 
time. It is full of depth, colours, different clearances and 
shadows. In order to take account of the sense of such 
space, Wittgenstein used the notion of the “enchanted 
swamp” where “everything tangible disappears” (MS, p. 
105, 116)3. It has its own independent reality and can nei-
ther be arrested nor grasped (MS, p. 107, 1)
4. Wittgenstein 
believes that the very intention of expressing this change-
ability or flow already infringes on language limits and 
goes beyond sense (MS, p. 107, 159)
5. After all, how does 
one describe what is timeless by means of language which 
is made possible in time (PB, p. 48)
6?  
Again, this raises the problem of “seeing”. In a sense, 
space is irreal – it is nothing to me; “by its nature, it does 
not have an owner” (PB, p. 71, MS p. 107, 1)
7. To quote 
Husserl from his Ding und Raum, experience “turns into a 
bustle (Gewühl) of meaningless impressions” (Husserl 
1973, 288). What seems the closest in experience turns 
out to be the most distant and vague in analysis
8. How 
then does one account for the phenomenon of space? 
Wittgenstein believed that it should be referred to the lan-
guage itself, language which would be able to capture the 
flowing reality in words. This, however, proved to be im-
possible. 
                                                      
3 „Es ist als käme ich mit der Phänomenologischen Sprache in einen verau-
zuberten Sumpft wo alles 
erfassbare verschwindet.” 
4 „Der Geschichtsraum so wie er ist hat seine selbständige Realität“ 
5 „Es ist ganz klar, daβ wenn man hier dass Letze sagen will man eben auf die 
Grenze der Sprache kommen muss, die es ausdrückt.” 
6 „Wenn die Welt der Daten zeitlos ist, wie kann man dann überhaupt über sie 
reden?” Edmund Husserl ran against similar aporia when he wanted to de-
scribe primary consciousness of time and the constitutions of temporary ob-
jects (Husserl 1964, 100).  
7 „Der Gesichtsraum hat wesentlich keinen Besitzer. (…) Das Wesentliche ist, 
dass die Darstellung des Gesichtsraums ein Objekt darstellt und keine Andeu-
tung eines Subjekts enthält” (PB 71)  
„Der Gesichtsraum so wie er ist hat seine selbstständige Realität. Er selbst 
enthält kein Subjekt. Er ist autonom” (MS 107, 1). 
On the role of the subject and kinesthesis in space perception, see: PB. 72-74. 
8 In his lectures on space, Husserl said that „in transcendental reduction, 
human perception of space ceases to be human“ (Husserl 1973, 122).  
Contrasted with the method of logical analysis, seeing 
exposed the insufficiency and inadequacy of the method 
for the understanding of the way language operates. The 
act of seeing was to be supported with phenomenological 
analysis expressed in phenomenological language. How-
ever, such language will not suffice when the underlying 
act of seeing is devoid of the subject effecting it. As al-
ready noticed by Husserl, this is how “we arrive at a possi-
bility of a phenomenological mass as the only and final 
being, but the mass is so meaningless that there is no I, no 
you and no physical world” (Husserl 1973, 288). 
Morphological Period 
Since the beginning of the 1930s Wittgenstein worked on a 
new method for his philosophy which was to focus around 
the central notion of “grammar” and the catchphrase of “Do 
not think, but look!” (PI, p. 31). According to the philoso-
pher, in order to understand how language operates it 
needs to be seen and seeing consists in noticing interde-
pendencies and similarities. By noticing common forms, 
one notices analogies. The ideas put forward by Spengler 
and Goethe made Wittgenstein realise that it is necessary 
for the work of a philosopher to “see analogies” which 
means to have a kind of insight into the objects under in-
vestigation. Philosophy must therefore be based on seeing 
and correlated description.  
The method followed by Wittgenstein in his later period 
might be called morphology. “What I give is the morphol-
ogy of the use of an expression” (Malcolm 1972, 50), he 
said in one of his lectures. Morphology is not so much a 
discipline or a set of propositions as a way to put a prob-
lem, a method to explain it 
Morphology is typical for its lack of assumptions. It dis-
closes patterns ordering experience and recognises fig-
ures, shapes and forms by similarities and relations be-
tween phenomena. It is about seeing interdependencies in 
the correct aspect or attitude. Its object is not to explain 
phenomena my means of other phenomena (VOW, p. 
310), but to see relationships which are not based on the 
laws of cause and effect, but on similarity and analogy. 
One needs to see how language actually operates. Witt-
genstein said: “We put some form of language in the con-
text of its environment or we transform it in our imagination 
to gain an insight into the whole of space in which the 
structure of our language operates” (VoW, p. 310)9.  
Here, the problem of the subject comes back again. Who 
or what is this “we” with which Wittgenstein manifestly 
identifies himself? Is the subject something worldly or tran-
scendental? In the Investigations and later writings there 
are a number of arguments for the transcendental as well 
as naturalistic or social understanding. Wittgenstein him-
self did not provide any clear answers leaving the problem 
as perhaps one of the most important, if not the most im-
portant, issue related to the interpretation of his philosophy 
and the method he followed. He kept balancing between 
the natural and transcendental attitude and it might be the 
case that he lacked some radical methodological tool such 
as, for example, transcendental phenomenological reduc-
tion. 
                                                      
9 In our opinion, this “transformation in imagination” is strictly related to 
Husserl’s imaginative variation.

Der „Ur-Tractatus” – Zur eigenständigen Bedeutung der ersten 13 
Seiten von Wittgensteins MS 104 
Martin Pilch 
Wien, Österreich | martin.pilch@chello.at 
Abstract 
In der Unterscheidung selbständiger Zwischenstufen im sog. Prototractatus (MS 104) war die Aufmerksamkeit der Forschung 
bisher zumeist auf die ersten 28 Seiten (Core-Prototractatus) oder auf die ersten 70 bzw. 71 Seiten (proto-Prototractatus) 
gerichtet. Die ersten 28 Seiten gliedern sich aber noch einmal deutlich in zwei Textstufen, deren erste (die ersten 13 Seiten von 
MS 104) so etwas wie die Urfassung der Struktur des Tractatus bis Satz 6 enthält. Diese erste abgeschlossene Textstufe bildet 
ein ideales Referenzmodell für die Erforschung sowohl der vortractarischen Schriften als auch der weiteren Entwicklung des 
Prototractatus selbst. 
 
 
Im Vergleich zu den zahllosen Texten, die  Wittgensteins 
Tractatus in seiner letztendlich veröffentlichten Fassung 
zum Ausgangspunkt nehmen, gibt es nur relativ wenig Ar-
beiten, die den Weg hin zu dieser endgültigen Textgestalt 
thematisieren. Dabei gibt uns die Quellenlage hinreichend 
viele Dokumente aus der Frühzeit in die Hand, um den 
gedanklichen Weg zumindest teilweise nachzeichnen zu 
können. Unter diesen frühen Texten Wittgensteins nimmt 
ohne Zweifel die Handschrift MS 104 eine besondere Stel-
lung ein. Sie enthält mit dem sog. Prototractatus (S. 3–
103) nicht nur eine „frühe Fassung” des Tractatus, sondern 
bildet in gewisser Weise ein chronologisches Abbild des 
Entstehungsprozesses selbst. MS 104 dient Wittgenstein 
gleichermaßen als Werkbank zur Ausformulierung seines 
Systems wie als Protokollbuch für seine Fortschritte (Zum 
Hintergrund dieser „Backup-Funktion” von MS 104 im Zu-
sammenspiel mit einer „geordneten Parallelstruktur auf 
losen Blättern” siehe Bazzocchi 2006, S. 37). 
Arbeitsphasen und Zwischenstufen im Pro-
totractatus 
Der besondere Wert von MS 104 besteht nicht nur darin, 
daß uns Varianten, Streichungen und verworfene Formu-
lierungen erhalten geblieben sind, sondern v.a. in der In-
formation, die in der Reihenfolge der niedergeschriebenen 
Sätze enthalten ist. Auf den ersten Blick mutet diese Rei-
henfolge chaotisch an und sie ähnelt gar nicht einer ge-
ordneten Endfassung. Sie zeigt vielmehr, wie Wittgenstein 
die einzelnen Themen des Tractatus entwickelt und dabei 
im schon vorhandenen Nummernsystem hin und her 
springend dieses sukzessive vertieft. 
Es ist schon früh bemerkt worden, daß sich in der Hand-
schrift verschiedene Arbeitsphasen unterscheiden lassen, 
mit Zäsuren, die nicht nur auf Unterbrechungen in der Be-
arbeitung hindeuten, sondern auch auf einen Wechsel in 
der Technik. Zweien dieser Zäsuren (S. 28 bzw. S. 71) 
wurde darüber hinaus die besondere Bedeutung zuge-
messen, so etwas wie abgeschlossene Zwischenfassun-
gen im Prototractatus zu bilden. So bezeichnet Brian Mc-
Guinness die ersten 71 Seiten von MS 104 als proto-
Prototractatus (McGuinness 1989, S. 265), um anzudeu-
ten, daß Wittgenstein an dieser Stelle (Ende 1916/ Anfang 
1917) eine Fassung erreicht hat, die er als abgeschlossen 
ansehen konnte. Motiviert ist dies dadurch, daß erst S. 71 
den berühmten Satz 7 formuliert, während bemerkens-
werterweise alle anderen sechs Hauptsätze schon auf der 
ersten Textseite (S. 3) der Ausarbeitung gleichsam als 
Programm vorangestellt sind (Zu Funktion und Entstehung 
der S. 3 als „‚Grundriß‘ des gesamten Werkes” Keicher 
2012, S. 140). In ähnlicher Weise hat Jinho Kang dem 
Textbestand bis Seite 28 den Namen Core-Prototractatus 
verliehen (Kang 2005, S. 3), eine Bezeichnung, die tref-
fend die Bedeutung dieses Textabschnitts charakterisiert, 
als hier tatsächlich ein struktureller und inhaltlicher Kern-
bestand vorliegt, der sich vom Nachfolgenden deutlich ab-
hebt. 
Der Unterschied in der Kompositionstechnik vor und 
nach S. 28 ist jedenfalls auffällig. Während im Core-
Prototractatus hauptsächlich Neuformulierungen ohne auf-
findbare Vorlagen enthalten sind, beruht der Abschnitt von 
S. 28 bis 64 fast ausschließlich auf Textvorlagen aus sei-
nen Tagebüchern und den Notes on Logic, die Spolien 
gleich aus dem ursprünglichen Textumgebung herausgeb-
rochen und nicht selten gänzlich unverändert an passen-
der Stelle in den Prototractatus eingebaut wurden. 
Andreas Geschkowski bemerkt, daß der die ersten 28 
Seiten umfassende Textabschnitt seinerseits „in zwei Hälf-
ten” zerfällt (Geschkowski 2001, S. 65). Er hat dem jedoch 
keine tiefere Bedeutung zugemessen. Ich möchte diese 
Gliederung hier als Phase 1 (bis 13[10]
1) und Phase 2 (bis 
28[2]) bezeichnen und insbesondere von den nachfolgen-
den Phasen 3 (bis 34[4] – Einarbeitung Notes on Logic) 
und 4 (bis 64[2] – Einarbeitung Tagebücher) unterschei-
den. Während die beiden letztgenannten Phasen, wie er-
wähnt, eine systematische Verwertung früherer Texte dar-
stellen, dienen die ersten beiden dazu, zunächst (bis S. 
13) ein verzweigtes Grundgerüst zu schaffen und dieses 
(bis S. 28) einer ersten inhaltlichen Vertiefung zu unterzie-
hen. Die nachfolgende Phase 5 dient dann der Ausarbei-
tung von 6.x ff, also jenes Abschnitts, der sich mit den 
„Sätzen der Logik” befasst. (für einen Überblick über die 
Arbeitsphasen siehe die Tabelle am Ende) 
Die eigenständige Bedeutung der Phase 1 
Daß es Wittgenstein zunächst um die Schaffung einer tra-
genden Struktur geht, zeigt sich schon darin, daß die nur 
ca. 10% des Textbestandes umfassende Phase 1 bereits 
70% aller Hauptsätze und Hauptdezimalen und 59% aller 
zweistelleigen Dezimalen enthält. Dagegen finden sich in 
Phase 2 nur 7,6% der zweistelligen Dezimalen und gar 
keine „gewichtigeren” Sätze. Schon in rein struktureller 
Hinsicht nimmt Phase 1 eine deutliche Sonderstellung ein. 
 
                                                      
1 „13[10]” bedeutet „der 10. Satz auf der 13. Seite von MS 104”

Der Übergang zu Phase 2 ist konkret daran zu erkennen, 
daß mit 13[12] = PT 2.032 wieder zum zweiten Hauptsatz 
zurückgesprungen wird und in der Folge auf S. 14 an Sät-
ze von S. 5 und 6 angeknüpft wird. Mit Phase 2 beginnt 
ein neuer Durchlauf in der Form einer Überarbeitung und 
Erläuterung des Textbestandes von Phase 1. Die Numme-
rierung erweitert sich zunächst zu drei- und vierstelligen 
Dezimalen, erfordert aber beim weiteren Fortschreiten im-
mer längere Zahlenkolonnen. Das ganze System der De-
zimaldarstellung scheint Wittgenstein in Phase 2 beinahe 
zu entgleiten, v.a. bedingt durch die ausführliche Kommen-
tierung von 19[4] = PT 4.1022 („Was sich in der Sprache 
ausdrückt, können wir nicht durch sie ausdrücken.”) mit 
nicht weniger als 32 erläuternden Sätzen niedrigerer Stufe 
mit bis zu achtstelligen Dezimalnummern (z.B. 24[6] = 
4.10227251). Hätte Wittgenstein diese Dichte an Kom-
mentaren allen vierstelligen Dezimalen zukommen lassen, 
wäre der Tractatus ein sehr dickes Buch geworden. 
In inhaltlicher Hinsicht erweist sich Phase 1 als erste in 
sich geschlossene Präsentation des Systems bis Satz 6, 
der zugleich den Schlußsatz dieser Urfassung bildet. Es ist 
darum mindestens ebenso auffällig, was hier noch fehlt. 
Die Stichworte in der Reihenfolge ihrer Behandlung lauten: 
Tatsache, logischer Raum, Gegenstand, Sachverhalt, Bild, 
Form der Abbildung, Gedanke, Satzzeichen, Projektion, 
logische Form, Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten, einfache Zeichen, 
Elementarsatz, Kombinatorik der Wahrheitswerte, Wahr-
heitsfunktion, Operation, Klammerausdruck, Wahrheitsbe-
dingungen, Folgebeziehung zwischen Sätzen, Tautolo-
gie/Kontradiktion, N-Operator. 
Die innere Entwicklung der Phase 1 
Phase 1 zerfällt bei noch näherer Betrachtung selbst 
wieder in drei Abschnitte: zunächst werden auf den Seiten 
4–6 die Hauptsätzen 1 bis 3 weiter entfaltet, also Ontolo-
gie und Bildtheorie. Diese Seiten tragen ganz deutlich die 
Züge von unmittelbar sich entwickelnden Gedanken, zwar 
im Rahmen des vorgegebenen Programms, doch in neuen 
und eigenständigen Formulierungen. Es handelt sich im 
Gegensatz zur Annahme Potters nicht um eine geordnete 
Abschrift bereits fertiger Überlegungen ("based on the loo-
se leaf summary" Potter 2013, S. 25); auch Bazzocchi 
sieht darin "a typical first writing" (Bazzocchi 2008, S. 20).  
Diesen ursprünglichen Charakter eines sich erst entwi-
ckelnden Texts und Nummernsystems kann man auch 
daran erkennen, daß Wittgenstein sich anfangs die Mühe 
macht, die Nummern für spätere Einschübe von Sätzen 
eigens nachzutragen (z.B. der Hinweis auf den Einschub 
von 2.032-07 zwischen 2.02 und 2.11 auf S. 4), so daß die 
ersten Seiten mit Hilfe dieser zusätzlichen Verweise tat-
sächlich die korrekte Abfolge der Nummern wiedergeben – 
ein angesichts der zu erwartenden Komplexität völlig hoff-
nungslose Verfahrensweise, die ab S. 7 (3.02 wird noch 
nachgetragen) ganz aufgegeben wird. Sie unterstreicht 
aber den Eindruck, daß wir es mit einem frischen Beginn 
zu tun haben. Das Zurückspringen auf bereits geschriebe-
ne Sätze ist für diese Verfahrensweise ganz typisch. Beg-
riffe werden eingeführt (etwa „Wirklichkeit” auf S. 5) und 
vorangehende Sätze daraufhin korrigiert: „Modell der Tat-
sachen” auf S. 4 wird verändert in "Modell der Wirklich-
keit”. „Wirklichkeit” wird erst dadurch zum Gegenspieler 
der schon auf S. 3 präsenten „Möglichkeit” ("des Beste-
hens und Nichtbestehens von Sachverhalten”). Es zeich-
net sich eine allmähliche Verfestigung der Terminologie 
ab, begleitet von der kreativen Einführung neuer Begriffe 
(z.B. „Wahrheitsbedingung” auf S. 11 mit nachfolgender 
Korrektur auf S. 7; „Wahrheitsgründe” auf S. 12). Gewöhn-
liche Ausdrücke der Sprache mutieren so zu termini tech-
nici 
des 
Systems: 
„Darstellen” 
wird 
mit 
Sachver-
halt/Möglichkeit 
verknüpft, 
"Abbilden” 
mit 
Tatsa-
che/Wirklichkeit und beide terminologischen Komplexe 
werden ihrerseits verknüpft („Das Bild bildet die Wirklich-
keit ab, indem es eine Möglichkeit des Bestehens und 
nicht Bestehens von Sachverhalten darstellt” 6[6] = PT 
2.201). „Ausdrücken” wiederum ist reserviert für das Ver-
hältnis von „Satz” und „Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten”. Der Stil 
der Eingangsseiten ist geprägt durch ein knappes, suk-
zessiv erweitertes Begriffsrepertoire, das in ebenso knap-
pen Sätzen zu einem Gewebe verknüpft wird. Ein Gutteil 
der Enigmatik des Tractatus verdankt sich dieser Technik. 
Auf den Seiten 4–6 werden gleichsam die grundlegen-
den Pflöcke eingeschlagen, die für Ontologie und Bildtheo-
rie bestimmend sind: Die Bildtheorie in dieser ursprüngli-
chen Fassung wird mit vier Sätzen (4[5]–4[8]) als Modell-
theorie ganz in der Inspiration von Hertz eingeführt. Das 
Modell besteht schlicht darin, daß (einfachen) Gegenstän-
den Elemente des Bildes entsprechen, wobei das Bild sei-
nerseits Tatsache ist. Tatsachen werden also durch ande-
re Tatsachen modelliert. Der zunächst dominierende Beg-
riff „Modell” wird später zu Gunsten von „Bild” zurückge-
nommen und bis auf die Erwähnung in 4[5] = PT 2.12 wie-
der gestrichen. Auch die Ontologie wird mit 4[3] und 4[4] 
entscheidend dadurch festgelegt, daß Gegenstände ein-
fach sind und in ihrer unmittelbaren Verbindung „Sachver-
halte" bilden. Die Verkettung der Gegenstände (5[7] = PT 
2.03), die einer ebensolchen Verkettung von Namen ge-
genübergestellt wird (9[3] = PT 4.22), ist überhaupt der 
zentrale Gedanke dieser Urfassung der Ontologie des 
Tractatus. 
Die anschließenden Seiten 7–9 dienen hauptsächlich 
der Ausarbeitung von Satz 4, wobei die Sequenz der Sät-
ze 4.1 bis 4.4 auf S. 3 die vielleicht kompakteste Darstel-
lung der auf molekulare Sätze verallgemeinerten Bildtheo-
rie enthält. Auffällig ist, daß in den zugeordneten Abschnit-
ten weder der verallgemeinerte Sinnbegriff von 4.2 erläu-
tert wird noch die im Tractatus absolut singuläre Verwen-
dung von „Bedeutung” in 4.3 (daß nämlich eine Art von 
Möglichkeit, die „Wahrheitsmöglichkeiten der Elementar-
sätze”, die Bedeutung einer anderen Art von Möglichkeit 
bildet, die „des Bestehens und nicht Bestehens von Sach-
verhalten”). Tatsächlich behandeln die Erläuterungen der 
Sätze 4.1. bis 4.4. ganz andere Themen, wie den „Satz als 
Behauptung” (später verworfen), den Elementarsatz, 
Wahrheitswertschemata und das Satzzeichen. 
Die Seiten 10–13 betreten Neuland. Wittgenstein geht 
über zur Darstellung von Systemteilen (Wahrheitsfunktion 
und Operation), von denen man vermuten darf, daß er 
zum Zeitpunkt der Zusammenstellung des Programms von 
S. 3 noch keine konkrete Vorstellung (zumindest ihrer Dar-
stellung) hatte. Das zeigt sich daran, daß die Hauptdezi-
malen 5.1, 5.2 und 5.3 im Programm auf S. 3 noch fehlen 
und erst jetzt (auf den Seiten 10 und 11) eingeführt wer-
den und das in so unbeholfener Weise, daß 5.1 und 5.2 
später in der „Korrektur”-Phase verworfen werden und die 
ganze Darstellung der Operation einer grundlegenden 
Überarbeitung unterzogen wird. Das steht in deutlichem 
Gegensatz zu den Sätzen 4.1–4.4., die so, wie sie ur-
sprünglich konzipiert wurden, bis in die Druckfassung un-
verändert geblieben sind. Der vorläufige Charakter zeigt 
sich auch daran, daß die Formel für die allgemeine Form

 212
der Wahrheitsfunktion (Satz 6) am unteren Ende von S. 3 
aus philologischen Gründen ein späterer Nachtrag sein 
muss. Erkennbar ist das daran, daß Wittgenstein für die 
Satzvariable auf den Seiten 11 und 13 ursprünglich nicht 
den griechischen Buchstaben „α” verwendet hat, sondern 
„x” und sich erst durch die Einführung der Funktion „φ(x)” 
in 13[10] = PT 5.32 gezwungen sah, alle vorangehenden 
„x” (durch deutlich sichtbares Schließen der Bauches auf 
der linken Seite) in „α” zu verwandeln. „α” und „N(ᾱ)” auf 
Seite 3 sind aber nicht in dieser Weise korrigiert, also 
müssen sie zumindest jünger sein als 13[10] und stellen 
jedenfalls eine spätere Ergänzung dar. Es ist also durch-
aus denkbar, daß Wittgenstein zwar von Anfang an eine 
Formulierung der allgemeinen Form der Wahrheitsfunktion 
in Satz 6 angeben wollte, aber den dafür nötigen Symbo-
lismus erst noch entwickeln musste (zum Thema der Ent-
stehung von Satz 6 siehe auch Bazzocchi 2010). 
Auch eine andere Korrektur auf S. 12 weist auf Un-
schlüssigkeiten in der frühesten Fassung hin. Der Satz 
12[9] = PT 5.07 lautete ursprünglich: „Die Tautologie folgt 
aus allen Sätzen; sie sagt nichts. Aus der Contradiction 
folgen alle Sätze; sie sagt das Unmögliche.” Während der 
erste Satz in den Tractatus übernommen wird, wird der 
zweite, die Kontradiktion betreffende, in MS 104 wieder 
gestrichen, als klar wird, daß er nicht mit der Konzeption 
der „Wahrheitsgründe” kurz davor in 12[2] kompatibel ist. 
Das logische Prinzip „ex contradictione quodlibet” gehört 
also explizit nicht zu Wittgensteins System (zum Hinter-
grund Goldstein 1986). 
Fassen wir alle Besonderheiten der Phase 1 des Pro-
totractatus zusammen, ihre Bedeutung als basale Struktur 
für die ganze Abhandlung, ihre inhaltliche Kompaktheit 
und die Einsichten, die sich aus ihrer inneren Entwicklung 
für das Verständnis des Tractatus gewinnen lassen, so 
erscheint es gerechtfertigt, sie als relevante Zwischenstufe 
aufzufassen und in ihr so etwas wie eine Urfassung der 
Systemdarstellung zu sehen, die sich als „Ur-Proto-
tractatus” bezeichnen ließe.   
Der „Ur-Tractatus” als Referenzmodell 
Mit dem „Ur-Prototractatus” oder „Ur-Tractatus” ist eine 
erste, wenn auch vorläufige, so doch geschlossene Dar-
stellung erreicht, die die Anatomie des sich entwickelnden 
Werks vollständig aufzeigt. Am eindrucksvollsten zeigt sich 
diese Selbständigkeit, wenn man eine nach PT-Nummern 
geordnete Fassung herstellt und beachtet, wie sich dabei 
die Akzente im Vergleich zum Prototractatus und zur ver-
trauten Druckfassung verschieben: es eröffnet sich ein 
Blick auf den Tractatus, in dem gewissermaßen dessen 
tragenden Fundamente freigelegt sind. Viel von dieser ers-
ten Form ist unverändert in die Druckfassung erhalten und 
dort, wo es Änderungen gab (etwa die Hauptdezimalglie-
derung von Satz 3 und 5), ist gerade die Art und Geschich-
te dieser Modifikationen von Interesse, weil sie zeigen, 
welche logischen und philosophischen Probleme vorerst 
noch unbewältigt geblieben sind. 
Die ersten 13 Seiten des Prototractatus bilden das idea-
le Referenzmodell für die Erforschung der Entwicklung des 
Tractatus und seiner Vorgeschichte. Durch das Heraus-
greifen gerade dieser Textstufe ergibt sich eine Perspekti-
ve in zwei Richtungen: einerseits zu den vorangehenden 
Tagebüchern und andererseits zu den späteren Entwick-
lungsstufen im Prototractatus und darüber hinaus zum Re-
visionsprozeß, der zuletzt zu den Typoskripten TS 204 und 
TS 202 führt. 
Die Berücksichtigung des Urtractatus wird insbesondere 
der systematischen Erforschung der Tagebücher zugute 
kommen. Die Kriegstagebücher werden von der For-
schung in einer Weise herangezogen, die diesen Texten 
zumeist nicht gerecht wird. Sie werden bevorzugt dazu 
verwendet, die jeweilige Interpretation des Autors zu ein-
zelnen Sätzen des Tractatus zu stützen, wird dabei aber 
i.d.R. sowohl die innere Entwicklung der Tagebücher als 
auch die Differenz zum Tractatus selbst außer acht gelas-
sen. Da die Tagebücher experimentelle Überlegungen in 
viele Richtungen anstellen, findet sich auch für beinahe 
jede Position das passende Zitat. 
Eine systematische Darstellung der philosophischen Po-
sitionen in den frühen Tagebüchern in einer vergleichba-
ren Weise, wie Michael Potter sie für die Notes on Logic 
geleistet hat (Potter 2009), steht immer noch aus.  Bedeut-
sam ist, daß fast alle Schlüsselbegriffe (wie Sachverhalt, 
Elementarsatz, Sinn, Gegenstand) mit dem Beginn von 
MS 104 eine im Vergleich zu den Tagebüchern abwei-
chende und präzisierte Bedeutung bekommen haben und 
es ist diese systematisch-terminologische Fixierung, die im 
Urtractatus zuallererst geleistet wird. So wird mit der ter-
minologischen Unterscheidung von „Sachverhalt” und 
„Sachlage”, die in den Tagebüchern noch fehlt (Potter 
2013 S. 27), klargestellt, daß der „Sachverhalt” die kleinste 
beschreibbare Einheit der Welt bildet und der „Elementar-
satz” gewinnt erst durch das, was man als die „Grundglei-
chung” im Urtractatus ansehen könnte, daß nämlich „ein 
Elementarsatz das Bild genau eines Sachverhalts (i.S. ei-
ner solchen kleinsten beschreibbare Einheit) darstellt”, den 
Status eines „logischen Atoms”, aus dem sich wahrheits-
funktional dann alle Sätze gewinnen lassen zur Beschrei-
bung aller Sachlagen, d.h. der Welt. 
Der Urtractatus bildet für die Systementwicklung in den 
Tagebüchern so etwas wie einen perspektivischen Flucht-
punkt: er repräsentiert jene Positionen, die der gedankli-
che Prozess Wittgensteins bis zum Beginn der Nieder-
schrift von MS 104 erreicht haben muß, ohne daß wir in 
der Lage wären, diesen Prozess in seiner Gesamtheit zu 
verfolgen, weil nicht alle relevanten Manuskripte erhalten 
geblieben sind. Insbesondere für die Lücke zwischen Juni 
1915 und April 1916 sind wir auf Umwege und Rekon-
struktionen angewiesen, deren spekulativer Gehalt umso 
geringer sein wird, je besser wir die angrenzenden Text-
stadien in ihrer Eigenständigkeit verstehen.

The Contractarian Theory of Animal Rights as a New Perspective in 
Moral Philosophy 
Dorota Probucka 
Cracow, Poland | dorotaprobucka@op.pl 
Abstract 
The aim of this article is to present a new understanding of the theory of moral contract and linking it with the idea of animal 
rights. The author focuses his attention on the views of the philosopher Mark Rowlands. In his opinion, contractualism should be 
reconsidered and reformulated. This theory, contrary to popular opinion, can provide a philosophical basis for the idea of animal 
rights and the rights of  people who do not meet the condition of being rational. 
 
 
Most philosophers believe that the theory of social contract 
cannot be used as a basis for granting moral rights to  
those beings  who do  not participate in  the contract. 
Thus, since animals do not meet the requirement of being 
rational, the  contractual theory is not anyhow related to 
the idea of animal rights. Consequently,  humans  do not 
have any direct moral obligations to  animals.  As moral 
duties apply to people only, the treatment of animals 
should be determined solely by the interests of the species 
Homo sapiens. The philosopher Mark Rowlands takes an 
opposite position (Rowlands 1998). In his opinion, contrac-
tarianism, reconsidered and reformulated, can provide a 
philosophical underpinning for the idea of animal rights. 
His new interpretation of the contractual thinking  takes 
into account some  differences between two classical va-
rieties of the theory of social contract. Rowlands is con-
vinced that many interpretive errors  result from  equating 
these two varieties with each other. 
The first variety, which is embodied in the theory of so-
cial contract by Thomas Hobbes, emphasizes the benefits 
the individuals gain from their agreement,  such as  protec-
tion of human life, body and private property. Everyone, as  
being  endowed with unlimited freedom, is a threat to oth-
ers. Moral rules are established in order to protect the indi-
vidual against other individuals. Rowlands claims that un-
der such an understanding of the social contract not only 
animals  are excluded from moral life, but so are mentally 
defective people as  incapable of rational thought. Their 
exclusion is not only a result of their inability of intellectual 
understanding or applying moral principles, but these peo-
ple, because of their intellectual disability, are weak and do 
not threaten anyone. Thus,  allowing  them to participate in 
the  social contract  would not bring any potential  benefit 
for  other participants. Let us remind once again that, ac-
cording to Hobbes, a contract is concluded in order to pro-
tect any human being  against those who may endanger 
others.  This kind of self-interest determines the scope and 
nature of the contract. For this reason such an understand-
ing of the social contract precludes any discussion about 
animal rights. Animals do not meet the requirement of ra-
tionality nor do they pose  any greater threat for anyone. 
As not being participants of the agreement, they do not 
have a  moral status. Rowlands’ conclusion is that such a 
theory denies the moral value to animals and people men-
tally flawed  and excludes all of these beings from moral 
community. 
Let us examine the second variety of the social contract 
theorizing. Based on the ethics of Kant, this way of think-
ing is represented in contemporary social philosophy  by 
John Rawls. The central place is given is his theory to the 
idea of impartiality. Impartiality is  presented as a specific, 
preferable attitude that  determines the moral reflection. It 
is possible for a man to attain such an attitude by applying 
a heuristic method called by Rawls “the original position” 
(Rawls 1958). It is a hypothetical situation in which all par-
ticipants experience temporary amnesia (“the veil of igno-
rance”) as well as lose the knowledge of  their own and 
others’ preferences, goals, inclinations, etc.,  concerning  
their social and economic status. Nobody knows their own 
and other people’s talents, desires, aspirations, level of 
intelligence, sexual orientation, material wealth, etc.  Thus, 
if all participants of the hypothetical situation have forgot-
ten their knowledge of the physical, mental and social 
condition of anyone, then no one can be  tendentious or 
biased against any other. 
Rowlands examines in detail this version of contractari-
anism that, in his opinion, can provide a basis for the 
granting of basic, moral rights to animals and people intel-
lectually handicapped. The claim  that all participants of 
the contract must be rational does not follow from the as-
sumption that any  holder of moral rights must be a rational 
entity. Thus,  contractarianism does not necessarily limits 
the scope of moral community exclusively to  rational 
agents because moral rights do not apply solely  to the 
participants of the agreement.  
How should we interpret the contract theory in order to 
prevent the exclusion of non-rational beings? Rowlands 
proposes to remove significant interpretive errors, which, in 
his opinion, are present in the previous analyses of Rawls’ 
theory.  One of them is a common erroneous understand-
ing of two categories:  “the original position” and “the veil 
of ignorance.” One  must  not interpret “the original posi-
tion” as something  real because this phrase has no de-
scriptive meaning nor  does it denote any actual state of 
affairs. It is only an imagined  characteristic of the process 
of reasoning that yields an answer to the following ques-
tion.  Assume that we have a certain property favorable for 
us. What moral principle should  we agree on if we were to 
be deprived of this property? When we reason in such a 
way, we become participants of the situation that is named  
“the original position”.  For example, suppose we have 
such a feature as being male. The participation in “the 
original position” in this case would consist in imagining 
that we have lost this attribute, that is, we ceased to be 
male. If we were placed in such a new situation, what 
moral principles would we agree to be applied to us? 
Should we continue to support the rules beneficial for 
men? Or should we begin to prefer those that are benefi-
cial for women? 
How to reconcile the new interpretation of Rawls’ theory 
with the idea of animal rights?  Participating in “the original 
position”  now means that our awareness of being human

beings should be suspended. Rowlands makes us think of 
a hypothetical mode of our existence which can be thought 
of provided that we admit the possibility of reincarnation. 
Imagine that metempsychosis, transmigration of the 
soul, is in fact true. And suppose, at some time when 
you are in between souls, God says to you: I am not go-
ing to tell who or what you are going to be in your next 
life. However, I shall allow you to choose what moral 
principles you would like to see adopted in whatever 
world it is you are going to inhabit. (…) The point is 
simply that this is another way of setting up the original 
position, and the restrictions on one’s reasoning about 
oneself that effectively constitute this position.  The veil 
of ignorance is, in the case, effected by the fact that you 
do not occupy a body and God will not tell you which 
body you are going to occupy next. (Rowlands, 1998, p. 
139) 
Rowlands presents this imaginary story as an example of a 
radically different interpretation of “the original positions”. 
In this case, “the veil of ignorance” would  involve  imagi-
nary loss of a specific feature defined as  “having a body” 
and the lack of knowledge of the physical form in which we 
will be embodied  in the time to come. The crucial point of 
this reasoning is that our bias is removed not only by the 
forgetting our position in society, but also by the uncer-
tainty about which  kind of body, human or animal, will be 
given to us in the next incarnation. Would we then still stick 
to the moral rules that are intended to protect the interests 
of human beings only? After all, we do not know now of 
whether we will be humans or animals in the next incarna-
tion. 
Moreover,  there is  another interpretation of “the original 
position”, also presented by Rowlands, which also bears 
on the idea of animal rights. The philosopher starts his re-
flection from an analysis of Rawls’s argument concerning 
the limits of individual rights. In his view,  Rawls’s argu-
ment can be presented  in the form of the following rea-
soning with  P1, P2, and  P3 as premises and conclusion 
C. 
P1. If an individual X is not responsible for their pos-
session of property P, then X is not morally entitled to 
P. 
P2. If X is not morally entitled to P, then X is not morally 
entitled to whatever benefits accrue from their posses-
sion of P. 
P3. For any individual X, there will be a certain set of 
properties S such that X possesses S without being re-
sponsible for possessing S. 
C. Therefore, for any individual X, there is a set S of 
properties such that X is not morally entitled to the 
benefits which accrue from possession of S. (Row-
lands, 1998, p. 128) 
Thus, if we have an attribute that has not been worked out 
by us, then the very fact of possessing it may not be a suf-
ficient reason for deriving any social benefits from having 
that property. If our  economic and racial status is deter-
mined by birth, it  should not be the source of any moral 
privileges or the basis for making any claims. Furthermore, 
the social benefits that an individual owes to his or her in-
nate abilities and talents are a sign of moral injustice. This 
reasoning provides a rationale for a  methodological pro-
ject aimed at creating  moral principles applicable in the 
context of liberal democracy. Rationality counts among the  
qualities of a human being that are assigned to us  rather 
than achieved. It  is true that we can develop and practice 
this ability, but we have no power to bring it to existence. It 
is nature itself that determines the presence of this particu-
lar trait in a human being, and its possession  is morally 
indifferent. No one can claim  a moral right to social privi-
leges because of having a particular  natural gift. There-
fore, the idea to confine the set of  beneficiaries of a social 
agreement to rational individuals should be regarded as 
incompatible with the idea of equality. As participants in 
“the original position”, we should suspend the knowledge 
of our rationality too. 
Rowlands considers  his conclusions as compatible with 
Rawls’ theory as he interpreted it.  Recall that everyone 
involved in “the original position” is assumed to have for-
gotten the properties which have so far characterized his 
or her status. No one can be sure that at the end of this 
thought experiment and will  “wake up”  as a rational indi-
vidual. As a consequence, individuals incapable of rational 
thought must be admitted to the category of entities whose 
life has a moral dimension. Morality must equally protect 
rational and non-rational individual beings. Animals should 
not be excluded from moral practice and they should enjoy 
moral respect. The sphere of moral life may not be limited 
to the representatives of  the species Homo sapiens. 
The above conclusion leads to the question of whether 
the contractual theory of animal rights involves an approval 
of vegetarianism as a moral obligation.  Recall that “the 
original position” is interpreted by Rowlands as a heuristic 
method for the resolving of moral problems.  With this 
method we are in a position to construe, at least in our 
minds, some new aspects of the world in which we live. 
Should vegetarianism be accepted as a commonly rec-
ommended practice under  the new vision of the world in 
which more living entities are endowed with the rights 
which have so far been reserved for humans? According 
to Rowlands, we have to put ourselves in “the original posi-
tion”, that is, we should apply a heuristic method based on 
a special  way of thinking, the way that requires of us the 
suspension of our current knowledge of our own physical 
and mental life and the knowledge about our  species as a 
whole. The suspension means that we temporarily refuse 
to claim the knowledge of whether we are human or animal 
and we decide to forget about our goals, interests, and  
preferences. Thus, it may well be that we are animals 
commonly eaten by people. If so, our decision, which is  
motivated by self-interest, should lead us to the recognition 
of a meatless diet as a primary moral obligation. Let’s em-
phasize that the appeal to self-interest would be associ-
ated with our ignorance about the status of our species. 
The risk of being an animal and experiencing the suffering 
may radically change our approach to the problem as it 
produces the feeling of being personally involved. 
The development of animal husbandry produces  various 
problems so far as its economic foundations are con-
cerned. In addition, many proponents of this common prac-
tice point out that the dissemination of vegetarianism, seen 
from an economic point of view, will have disastrous ef-
fects on the development of many branches of industry. 
Moreover, it will pose a threat to economic existence of 
many people. Rowlands admits that the supporters of 
these views  think  in line with the contractarian scheme, 
yet if they distort it. Their reasoning can be rendered as 
follows. Being in “the original position” implies for an indi-
vidual forgetting about one’s  properties, including  one’s 
job or profession. But how to forget it if one is employed in 
a company that keeps animals for meat. Once the  exis-
tence and well-being of a worker depend on the develop-
ment of this industry, they cannot  accept the moral rules 
on rational grounds because their implementation would  
lead to the elimination of the whole   industrial sector.

Rowlands rejects the seeming compatibility of this rea-
soning with the requirements of contractarianism. In his 
opinion, this argument rests on an erroneous interpretation 
of “the original position” because moral significance is as-
signed to economic considerations. The contractarianism 
makes no reference to the profits from keeping certain in-
stitutions nor it is consistent with customizing the content 
of moral rules to the economic interests. This way of think-
ing is closer to the utilitarian calculation. In accordance 
with the contractarian thinking, we can prefer  the world 
with industrial animal husbandry or we may well opt for a 
world that is free from such a practice. It is  the degree of 
rationality of our choice that determines the moral status of 
either world. Let us assume that we do not know our spe-
cies belonging, that is, we do not know whether we are 
human or animal, whether we belong to the beings  who 
eat meat or to the ones who are eaten. If we do not take 
into account economic profits as having no relevance in 
this context, we must conclude that  a choice that is ra-
tional, for bringing us as smallest as possible loss, is the 
choice of the world without factory farming of animals.

Abstract 
Unter Philosophischer Praxis versteht man professionell betriebene philosophische Lebensberatung. In diesem Artikel werden 
eine kontinentale Konzeption von Philosophischer Praxis und eine analytische – anhand von Aufsätzen von Gerd Achenbach 
und Ben Mijuskovic – gegenübergestellt und mit einigen Bemerkungen Wittgensteins in Beziehung gesetzt. Es zeigt sich, dass 
diese Bemerkungen als Korrektiv sowohl der kontinentalen als auch der analytischen Auffassung gelesen werden können. 
 
 
0. Einleitung 
Dem Historischen Wörterbuch der Philosophie (Bd. 7, Arti-
kel „Praxis, Philosophische” von Odo Marquard) entnimmt 
man folgende Definition von Philosophischer Praxis (ab-
gekürzt Ph.P.): 
„Den Begriff ‹Ph.P.› hat G. B. ACHENBACH 1981 […] 
bei der Gründung seines ‹Instituts für Ph.P.› geprägt: 
unter Ph.P. versteht er die professionell betriebene 
«philosophische Lebensberatung» […], die «in der Pra-
xis» […] eines Philosophen geschieht. […] Dabei ist 
«die Ph.P. ... ein freies Gespräch. ... Sie ... verabreicht 
keine philosophische Einsicht, sondern sie setzt das 
Denken in Bewegung: philosophiert» […] zusammen 
mit dem Ratsuchenden […].“ 
Achenbach kann als Vertreter einer kontinentalen Auffas-
sung der Philosophischen Praxis betrachtet werden, denn 
sein philosophischer Hintergrund ist von der deutschen 
Romantik und dem deutschen Idealismus, insbesondere 
von Hegel, geprägt. Bald nach der Gründung der Philoso-
phischen Praxis haben sich jedoch auch analytische Auf-
fassungen der Philosophischen Praxis entwickelt (vgl. La-
hav 1993). Eine solche Auffassung wird in einem Artikel 
von Ben Mijuskovic, Universitätsprofessor an der California 
State University sowie Clinical Social Worker, umrissen. 
Achenbachs und Mijuskovics Zugang sollen im Folgenden 
zu einander und zu gewissen Überlegungen Wittgensteins 
in Bezug gesetzt werden. 
Eine Rechtfertigung dafür,  Wittgenstein zu Themen der 
Philosophischen Praxis zu konsultieren, liefert er selbst – 
im Rahmen einer Auseinandersetzung mit Malcolm schrieb 
Wittgenstein: 
„Was nutzt das ganze Philosophiestudium, wenn für Sie 
nichts dabei herauskommt als die Fähigkeit, halbwegs 
überzeugend über irgendeine abstruse Frage der Logik 
etc. zu reden, und wenn es Ihre Denkweise über die 
wichtigen Fragen des Alltags nicht verbessert [...] Wis-
sen Sie, es ist mir klar, daß es schwierig ist, richtig über 
‚Gewißheit’, ‚Wahrscheinlichkeit’, ‚Wahrnehmung’ usw. 
nachzudenken. Aber es ist womöglich noch schwerer, 
wirklich ehrlich über Ihr Leben oder das anderer Leute 
nachzudenken oder zu versuchen nachzudenken. Und 
das Unglück ist, daß das Nachdenken über diese Dinge 
nicht spannend ist, sondern oft geradezu ekelhaft. Und 
wenn es ekelhaft ist, ist es am wichtigsten. […]“ (zit. in: 
Macho 1996, 22f.) 
Offensichtlich dachte Wittgenstein, dass die Philosophie 
zum Nachdenken über die wichtigen Lebens- und Alltags-
fragen beitragen sollte. Dass für ihn außerdem das Philo-
sophieren in dialogischer Form in verschiedener Hinsicht 
wichtig war, ist bekannt.  
1. Gerd Achenbachs kontinental geprägter 
Zugang – Lebensfragen als philosophi-
sche Fragen 
Wie aus der zitierten Passage hervorgeht, war Wittgen-
stein der Meinung, dass nicht alle Fragen, mit denen sich 
die Philosophen beschäftigen, Lebensfragen sind, die für 
das Leben des Einzelnen von Relevanz wären. In diese 
Richtung weist auch Achenbachs Kritik an der akademi-
schen Philosophie (vgl. z.B. Achenbach 2010, 199f.), der 
er mit Hinweis auf Hegel eine Philosophie gegenüberstellt, 
die „überhaupt als Angelegenheit des Lebens, und des 
ganzen Lebens, betrachtet [wird]“ (Hegel, zit. in Achen-
bach 2010, 45). 
Sind aber –  umgekehrt – alle Lebensfragen, mit denen 
die Gäste eine Philosophische Praxis besuchen, philoso-
phische Fragen? Achenbach ist überzeugt, dass sie zu-
mindest (fast immer) zu philosophischen Fragen werden 
können. Er zitiert Novalis: „Die Philosophie ist eigentlich 
Heimweh – Trieb, überall zu Hause zu seyn“ (zit. in 
Achenbach 2010, 81). Er schließt den Fall eher aus, dass 
der Philosophische Praktiker seinen Besucher weg oder 
zu jemand Anderem (z.B. zu einem Psychologen) schickt, 
weil seine Probleme keine philosophischen seien.  
Trotz seiner Skepsis gegenüber jeder systematischen 
Formulierung der Natur und der Vorgehensweise der Phi-
losophischen Beratung nennt Achenbach drei Grundregeln 
der Philosophischen Praxis. Laut der ersten Regel sei die 
Philosophische Praxis 
(1) „im Unterschied zu den Wissenschaften dem An-
spruch nach grenzenlos. [...] Und der Philosoph ist kein 
Fachmann. Was praktische Philosophie ist, läßt sich 
mithin auch nicht durch die Angabe einer besonderen 
‚Zuständigkeit’ bestimmen […].“ 
(2) „Philosophie [...] kann sich auf diese Regel nur ein-
lassen, sofern sie bereit und in der Lage ist, jedes Prob-
lem als philosophisches Problem anzunehmen und jede 
Frage philosophisch zu würdigen, d.h. als Frage an die 
Philosophie zuzulassen“ (Achenbach 2010, 77) 
Mijuskovic meint dagegen, dass man sehr wohl unter-
scheiden kann, „whether a client is experiencing a psycho-
logical rather than a philosophical issue“ (Mijuskovic 1995,  
95). Auf seine Abgrenzungskriterien werden wir gleich zu-
rückkommen.

Auch Wittgenstein nimmt in gewisser, aber ganz anderer 
Weise eine Präzisierung des Begriffs des „philosophischen 
Problems“ vor. Es „hat die Form: ‚Ich kenne mich nicht 
aus.‘“ (PU § 123) Es drückt also eine gewisse Orientie-
rungslosigkeit aus, die der Philosophische Praktiker 
schwer durch das Verabreichen einer fertigen Lösung ver-
schwinden lassen kann. 
Als dritte Regel formuliert Achenbach: 
„3. Das philosophische Denken vermag an alle Formen 
des Wissens, Behauptens, Meinens, an Empfindungen 
und Befindlichkeiten, Einstellungen und Handlungen, 
nicht zuletzt [...] an jedes wissenschaftlich aufgestellte 
Theorem anzuschließen,[...] da sie alle ihrerseits Mani-
festationen des Gedankens sind, mit Hegel geredet: in 
die 'Phänomenologie des Geistes' gehören.“ (Achen-
bach 2010, 85) 
Diese Auflistung – Wissen, Behaupten, Meinen, Empfin-
dungen, Einstellungen, Handlungen, wissenschaftlich auf-
gestellte Theoreme – liest sich wie ein Stichwortverzeich-
nis zum Werk Wittgensteins, der also ebenfalls diese Viel-
falt als Bereich der Philosophie zuließ.  
Mijuskovic dagegen stellt die Philosophische Beratung 
als eine Arbeit auf der rein kognitiven Ebene dar: „What 
makes a treatment philosophical rather than psychological 
is that its focus revolves around the individual’s first princi-
ples rather than centering on the subject’s emotional dis-
tress“ (Mijuskovic 1995, 94). 
2. Ben Mijuskovics analytischer Zugang – 
die vier Kriterien für ein philosophisches 
Beratungsgespräch 
Wie schon erwähnt, listet Mijuskovic einige Voraussetzun-
gen dafür auf, dass ein persönliches Problem im Rahmen 
einer Beratung als philosophisches Problem betrachtet 
wird. 
(1) Freie Wahl der Grundprinzipien („recognizing that the 
choice of first principles derives from the agents“ (Mi-
juskovic 1995, 88)) 
Mijuskovic geht davon aus, dass der Besucher einer Phi-
losophischen Praxis, wie jeder Mensch, einige „Grund-
überzeugungen“ („first principles“) hat. Zwar sind diese laut 
Mijuskovic nicht rational gewählt, aber sie sind doch ge-
wählt: sie sind „the result of individual passional decisions“ 
(Mijuskovic 1995, 87). Durch diese Akzentuierung der akti-
ven Rolle des Besuchers zeigt Mijuskovic, dass er – ähn-
lich wie Achenbach
1 – aus der Gegenüberstellung ak-
tiv/passiv ein Abgrenzungskriterium zur Psychotherapie 
macht: 
„The self-conscious realization that our outlook on life 
and reality […] ultimately and essentially resides in our-
selves intrinsically and essentially transforms us from 
passive psychological subjects into active philosophical 
agents. Philosophically, intellectually, cognitively we 
assume responsibility not only for the first principles of 
our beliefs but also for the links in the chain of reason 
which constitute the system [...] In opposition, psycho-
logical disorders are [...] the result of forces beyond the 
patient’s ability to control“ (Mijuskovic 1995,  88)   
Diese Voraussetzung der aktiven Wahl muss man aller-
dings in Lichte von Bemerkungen  Wittgensteins wie den 
folgenden relativieren: 
                                                      
1 Vgl. Achenbach 2010a, 32-33. Achenbach 2010, 104 (Motto). 
„Das Lehren der Sprache ist hier kein Erklären, sondern 
ein Abrichten.“ (PU, § 5) 
„Wir lernen als Kinder Fakten, z. B. daß jeder Mensch 
ein Gehirn hat, und wir nehmen sie gläubig hin. Ich 
glaube, [...] daß ich Urgroßeltern gehabt habe, daß die 
Menschen, die sich für meine Eltern ausgaben, wirklich 
meine Eltern waren, etc. Dieser Glaube mag nie aus-
gesprochen, ja, der Gedanke, daß es so ist, nie ge-
dacht werden.“ (ÜG § 159) 
(2) Widerspruchsfreiheit als Desideratum („that the ensu-
ing system developed from these first principles must ad-
here to the laws of consistency and non-contradiction“) 
Laut Mijuskovic soll im Rahmen der Philosophischen Be-
ratung das Gedankensystem des Gastes gemeinsam mit 
ihm überprüft werden, bis er zu einer „conceptual satisfac-
tion“ (Mijuskovic 1995, 99) kommt. Ähnlich klingt die fol-
gende Aussage Wittgensteins: „Frieden in den Gedanken. 
Das ist das ersehnte Ziel dessen, der philosophiert.“ (VB, 
87). Ist Widerspruchsfreiheit dafür notwendig? 
In Bezug auf die Mathematik schreibt Wittgenstein: 
„Aber du kannst doch einen Widerspruch nicht gelten 
lassen! – Warum nicht? Wir gebrauchen diese Form ja 
manchmal in unsrer Rede, freilich selten – aber man 
könnte es sich eine Sprachtechnik denken, in der er ein 
ständiges Implement wäre.“ (BGM VII, § 11, 370) 
Wenn diese Einstellung für die Mathematik gelten kann, 
dann doch für das tägliche Leben umso mehr: Warum soll 
es nicht sein können, dass ein Mensch bewusst mit einem 
Widerspruch in seinen Einstellungen leben will? Wittgen-
stein verschafft damit dem Widerspruch einen Platz in un-
serer Sprache, aber er tritt keinesfalls für einen Irrationa-
lismus ein. Nur befinden sich die Grenzen für den Wider-
spruch anders gelegen als es oft gefordert wird:  
„Kann man sagen: ‚Der Widerspruch ist unschädlich, 
wenn er abgekapselt werden kann‘? Was aber hindert 
uns daran, ihn abzukapseln? Daß wir uns im Kalkül 
nicht auskennen. Das also ist der Schaden.“ (Wittgen-
stein BGM III, §80, 209) 
Wir werden dann den Widerspruch ausschließen wollen, 
wenn er dazu führt, dass wir mit einem Problem – unserem 
Leben – dadurch schlecht zurecht kommen. Der Wider-
spruch stört vor allem dann, wenn er ein größeres Gefüge 
in unseren Einstellungen durcheinander bringt. 
Achenbach, als „Hegelianer“, sieht den Widerspruch 
eher unter dem Gesichtspunkt der fruchtbaren Dialektik. 
Dementsprechend betitelt er z.B. das zweite Kapitel seines 
Buchs, Vom Richtigen im Falschen, „Vom Leben in Wider-
sprüchen“. Auch zeigt er eine gewisse Skepsis gegenüber 
Argumenten; häufig (z.B. in Achenbach 2010,  111) zitiert 
er Feyerabend: „Was hilft ein Argument, das die Leute kalt 
läßt?“ 
(3) Intersubjektivität („that both the principles and system 
are intersubjectively communicable and shareable, rather 
than being personal and uniquely private“) 
Mijuskovic betrachtet die Verschiebung des Gesprächs-
inhalts weg von der individuellen Ebene der persönlichen 
Gefühle und Erlebnisse in Richtung universeller Begriffe 
und Argumente als Zeichen, dass das Gespräch bzw. die 
Beratung philosophisch wird: 
„[...] at the clinic where I work, I conduct a weekly men’s 
group [...] The main focus and pivotal center of the dis-
cussion is always the universal features of loneliness 
and intimacy. In this sense, I consider the group to be

219
engaged in philosophical counseling than psychother-
apy“ (Mijuskovic 1995,  85) 
Im Gegensatz dazu setzt Achenbach den Akzent auf die 
unbedingte Anerkennung der Individualität des Gastes als 
wesentliches Merkmal der philosophischen Beratung: 
„Die Mitte der Philosophischen Praxis [...] sind [...], zwei 
Individuen, die nicht etwa Varianten oder Modifikatio-
nen eines allgemeinen, verbindlich gedachten Wesens 
Mensch sind.“ (Achenbach 2010,  92) 
Anders als Mijuskovics in seinem Plädoyer für Argumente, 
intersubjektive Gültigkeit und Rationalität will Achenbach 
das Individuelle und Irrationale aus der philosophischen 
Beratung nicht ausschließen:  
„Was Hegel als Begriff der dialektischen Bewegung 
dachte, opponiert der Überheblichkeit, das 'Unvernünf-
tige' zu ignorieren, ebenso wie die Entschlossenheit, es 
‚zur Vernunft zu bringen‘. Philosophische Praxis ist die 
Zumutung an Philosophie, diese Einsicht zu bewähren“ 
(Achenbach 2010, 58) 
Was die Kommunizierbarkeit betrifft, verweist Achenbach 
auf Adornos Kritik an Wittgensteins Tractatus: 
„Wenn der berühmte Wittgensteinsche Satz sagt, daß 
man nur das sagen soll, was man klar aussprechen 
kann, über das andere aber schweigen, dann würde ich 
dem den Begriff der Philosophie geradezu entgegen-
setzen und sagen, die Philosophie sei die permanente 
und wie immer auch verzweifelte Anstrengung, das zu 
sagen, was sich eigentlich nicht sagen läßt.“ (Adorno, 
zit. in Achenbach 2010, 72) 
Gerade der spätere Wittgenstein bietet aber eine derart 
komplexe Analyse der Fragen zu Sagbarkeit, Kommuni-
zierbarkeit und Intersubjektivität, dass der Platz hier fehlt, 
sie ausführlich zu thematisieren. Es sei daher nur darauf 
verwiesen, dass man Mijuskovics genannte Dichotomie 
von „intersubjectively communicable and shareable“ und 
„uniquely private“ nach Wittgenstein nicht als solche auf-
recht erhalten kann. Bei der Verwendung von „uniquely 
private principles“ wären Klärungen angesagt; ob es sol-
che Prinzipien überhaupt gibt, hängt davon ab, wie man 
diese Termini versteht (Stichwort: Privatsprachenargu-
ment). Die Alternative zu – wie auch immer verstandenen 
– „private principles“ sind aber jedenfalls nicht notwendig 
„intersubjectively communicable principles“, da unsere 
Verständigung wesentlich auf Elementen einer Lebens-
form beruht, über die wir gerade nicht kommunizieren kön-
nen, weil sie unserer Kommunikation zu Grunde liegt (so-
mit wären sie nicht „communicable“ und „shareable“). 
(4) Kritisierbarkeit („that they are open to questioning, 
challenges, attack, or criticism“) 
Mijuskovic hält dies für ein wichtiges Abgrenzungskriteri-
um gegenüber einer psychotherapeutischen Beratung, 
denn diese unterscheide sich von einer philosophischen 
Beratung dadurch, dass 
„[...] the patient would be distressed to have his or her 
thoughts and feelings systematically challenged and 
criticized precisely because these views are not in-
tended to be universal truths but rather personal im-
pressions“ (Mijuskovic 1995, 89) 
Aus der Sicht Achenbachs hätte der Gast dagegen Recht, 
sich zu empören, wenn der Berater ohne Berücksichtigung 
der Einzigartigkeit seines Denkens und Empfindens seine 
Gedanken „systematisch herausfordern und kritisieren“ 
würde. Eine solche Einstellung würde nämlich nicht jener 
„heilsamen Kritik“ entsprechen, die laut Achenbach eine 
philosophischen Beratung benötigt: 
„Die Philosophische Praxis wird die Frage zu beantwor-
ten haben, wie eine heilsame Kritik möglich ist, und das 
ist eine Nennung des Falschen, die nicht lähmt, son-
dern Zuversicht bestärkt, die nicht mutlos, sondern Mut 
macht.“ (Achenbach 2010,  109) 
Bezugspunkte für seine vorsichtigere Auffassung von Kritik 
findet Achenbach u.a. bei Hegel, Adorno, Pascal und Ben-
jamin (vgl. Achenbach 2010, jeweils auf S. 52, 51-52, 100 
und 122). 
Auch 
Wittgenstein 
widerspricht 
der 
Forderung 
Mijuskovics nach der Kritisierbarkeit des Gedankensys-
tems des Besuchers – aber aus anderen Gründen als 
Achenbach. Es ist gerade das Wesentliche an gewissen 
unserer Prinzipien, dass sie nicht offen für Kritik und Zwei-
fel sind: 
„D.h. die Fragen, die wir stellen, und unsere Zweifel be-
ruhen darauf, daß gewisse Sätze vom Zweifel ausge-
nommen sind, gleichsam die Angeln, in welchen sich 
jene bewegen.“ (ÜG § 341) 
Das bedeutet nicht, dass Wittgenstein ausschließt, dass 
Fundamente einer Lebensweise geändert werden. Aber 
das geschieht nicht durch eine Entscheidung, die aufgrund 
von Argumenten und am Ende eines längeren Überle-
gungsprozesses stattfindet. Wittgenstein meint im Rahmen 
seiner Auseinandersetzung mit Moore: 
„[…] warum sollte ein König nicht in dem Glauben erzo-
gen werden, mit ihm habe die Welt begonnen? Und 
wenn nun Moore und dieser König zusammenkämen 
und diskutierten, könnte Moore wirklich seinen Glauben 
als den richtigen erweisen? Ich sage nicht, dass Moore 
den König nicht zu seiner Anschauung bekehren könn-
te, aber es wäre eine Bekehrung der besonderen Art: 
der König würde dazu gebracht, die Welt anders zu be-
trachten.“ (ÜG § 92) 
4. Fazit  
Wittgensteins Philosophie enthält wichtige Anregungen für 
die Philosophische Praxis, insbesondere findet man bei 
ihm Ansätze, die spezifische Natur eines philosophischen 
Problems zu definieren; dabei ist seine Auffassung von 
„philosophischen Problemen“ fast so liberal wie jene 
Achenbachs.  
Insgesamt stimmt seine Position jedoch weder mit einer 
kontinentalen noch mit einer analytischen Auffassung der 
philosophischen Beratung überein. Ohne der konzeptuel-
len – und somit gewissermaßen intersubjektiven – Analyse 
philosophischer Fragen ihren Wert absprechen zu wollen, 
suggeriert seine Philosophie in wichtigen Hinsichten Vor-
sicht in Bezug auf jene Objektivitätsstandards, mittels de-
rer Mijuskovic philosophische Probleme von psychologi-
schen abgrenzt: dass das System unserer Überzeugungen 
das Ergebnis einer bewussten Wahl sei, dass es kommu-
nizierbar und widerspruchsfrei sein soll, gilt allenfalls unter 
wesentlichen Einschränkungen.

Analytical vs. continental Philosophy: The Wrong Place of 
Wittgenstein in the History of Philosophy 
Henrique Jales Ribeiro 
Coimbra, Portugal | jalesribeiro@gmail.com 
Abstract 
In this paper it is argued provocatively that (1) the alleged dichotomy/opposition between “analytical philosophy” and 
“continental philosophy” must be set aside considering the recent inputs from the historiography of the analytical movement in 
general, which show that the former originates from the latter and/or overall from Western history of philosophy; that (2) this is 
exactly the case of Wittgenstein's thought and work; and, therefore, that (3) the concept itself of “analytical philosophy”, or of 
“analytical tradition in philosophy”, must be abandoned once and for all, specially when applied to studies of Wittgenstein’s 
philosophy. 
 
 
Introduction 
Tying Wittgenstein to analytical philosophy and, in particu-
lar, to the roots thereof is today commonplace in Anglo-
Saxon historiography concerning this author, and, gener-
ally speaking, the so-called “analytical tradition in philoso-
phy”. Peter Hacker, among others, developed this thesis, 
with great care, in several of his works (see Hacker 1996, 
1996a, 2001; cf. Ribeiro 2010). Underpinning the afore-
mentioned identity is the dichotomy and opposition be-
tween “continental” and “analytical philosophy”, whose ori-
gin (or its proto-history) is British philosophy from the nine-
teen-forties onwards (with A. J. Ayer, G. Ryle and others), 
i.e. a context that Wittgenstein himself (who lived and 
wrote in Cambridge almost permanently then) got to know 
directly and personally before he died (1951). Conse-
quently, the distinguishing criterion between the two kinds 
of philosophy has had, from the start, a geographic and/or 
geo-cultural version (based on the dichotomy and opposi-
tion between Great Britain [currently the English-speaking 
countries, lead by the USA] and continental Europe). Albeit 
quite controversial (Wittgenstein, for instance, was an Aus-
trian philosopher and, consequently, a “continental” one), 
this criterion apparently still holds, as the topic of this 
meeting illustrates (see the discussion and rehabilitation of 
the geographic criterion made by Glock 2008). All of this 
has given rise to the idea that Wittgenstein was, not only 
an analytical philosopher, or even, as mentioned before, 
one of the founders of analytical philosophy, but also one 
of its prime examples, when compared and contrasted with 
the philosophers of the so-called “continental philosophy”. 
Naturally, Wittgenstein in is main works (Wittgenstein 
1933, 1953) never saw himself as an “analytical philoso-
pher”, among other reasons because, in his time, like 
Hacker acknowledges, this expression alongside that of 
“analytical philosophy” were seldom used (see Haacker 
1996, pp. 3-4). They only earned the meta-historical and 
meta-philosophical meaning which we currently give to the 
respective concepts from the nineteen-seventies onwards; 
in other words, they are constructs at a particular moment 
in time, which amount to the ordinary modern readings and 
interpretations of the philosophy of the author of Tractatus 
and Philosophical Investigations. In particular, these are 
constructs which project into Wittgenstein's thought and 
philosophy a set of arguable assumptions and concep-
tions; and it is not clear, quite on the contrary, whether 
Wittgenstein himself supported and developed such as-
sumptions and conceptions. Other constructs before 
these, like identifying the Tractatus with Russell's logical 
atomism, as Pears (1956) did, had been introduced previ-
ously, discussed and dethroned. 
In this paper, we analyse and explore all of the historical-
philosophical connections already mentioned, while high-
lighting the following theses: that (1)  the alleged dichot-
omy and opposition between “analytical philosophy” and 
“continental philosophy” must be set aside considering the 
recent inputs from the historiography of analytical move-
ment in general, which show that the former originates 
from the latter and/or from the history of Western philoso-
phy in general; that (2) this is exactly the case of Wittgen-
stein's thought and work; therefore, that (3) the concept 
itself of “analytical philosophy”, or “analytical tradition in 
philosophy”, must be abandoned once and for all, specially 
when applied to studies of Wittgenstein’s philosophy. 
1. Analytical vs. continental philosophy: 
The emergence of the paradigms 
As suggested and shown in detail elsewhere (Ribeiro 
2002, 2010), the idea of an “analytical philosophy”, in con-
trast to another which would be “continental”, is a relatively 
recent philosophical construction. In effect, the concept 
which some today call “continental philosophy” is itself, in 
turn, a myth devised by “analytical philosophy”, that is, a 
philosophical construction of the latter. Until the nineteen 
seventies, the main schools of what we find to have been 
the analytical movement (namely, logical positivism, in its 
Viennese and American versions, and the so-called “Eng-
lish ordinary language philosophy”), lived side by side in 
discordance. They communicated, but without the neces-
sary meta-historical perception that they were a unified ‒ 
historically placed and rather consolidated ‒ philosophical 
movement or tradition. In effect, according to M. Dum-
mett's version of the subject-matter herein (Dummett 1978, 
pp. 437-458), the biggest enemy of British ordinary lan-
guage philosophers (like Austin and Ryle) was not meta-
physics and epistemology, but rather Rudolf Carnap and 
positivism (p. 437). These philosophers identified Russell's 
philosophy with a traditional, thus discredited, metaphys-
ics; Frege's philosophy, and the relevance thereof to phi-
losophy history overall, was generally ignored, with a few 
exceptions (namely J. L. Austin); and the philosophy of 
Wittgenstein himself, although the important part it played 
and its impact on philosophical thought was foreseen, was 
tied with Russell's and with that of the “Cambridge school” 
(see Pears 1956; Urmson 1962). In this context, the con-
cept that Ayer (1936) labelled and characterised in the 
nineteen thirties as the “British empiricist tradition in phi-
losophy” (Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Russell), and which 
a few decades later was at the root, at least partly, of “ana-

lytical philosophy” and of its opposite, “continental philoso-
phy”, was also discredited, given the role that Russell's 
philosophy (set aside, or even disregarded, at least by the 
British ordinary language philosophers) played in the al-
leged tradition. In other words, the foundations of “analyti-
cal philosophy” as an historically placed and unified 
movement were not an issue, nor, as I said at the begin-
ning, was anything that really corresponded to what we 
call today like that. This only came about from the nineteen 
seventies onwards, when the "American school", as M. 
Dummett labelled it (see Dummett 1978, p. 441), arrived 
on the international scene (Quine, Putnam and others). 
Only then, as contemporary historiography shows, did ac-
tual “analytical philosophy" begin to exist, as did the prob-
lem, which has survived to this day, of its roots in one or 
other proto-history (one rather contaminated by traditional 
metaphysics, as was the case of Russell's philosophy and 
logical positivism, and other more or less pure ones, as 
was the case, in P. Hacker's version (se  Hacker 1996, p. 
12ff), of Frege and Wittgenstein's philosophy). The domi-
nant conception in this regard, as I have upheld previously 
in Kirchberg and in other places about the connection be-
tween Wittgenstein and Russell (see Ribeiro 2005, 2010), 
is that the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus, unlike the Russell 
of the Pincipia Mathematica (Russel and Whitehead 1910-
1913), have presented, partly because of Frege, a pure 
version of logic ‒ i.e. free and exempt of psychological and 
epistemological assumptions. Consequently, he paved the 
way for research into a theory of meaning based on the 
study of the use of language in context, like that conducted 
under Philosophical Investigations, while highlighting, or at 
least anticipating, the essential limitations of that theory 
and, subsequently, the limitations of philosophy as a 
whole, as a systematic undertaking (see Hacker 1996, p. 
288ff). This is the conception which today inspires and 
guides most studies of Wittgenstein conducted in Western 
universities. 
1.1. The fall of the paradigms 
The historiography of the analytical movement in the past 
decades ‒ reputable works like that of Coffa (1991) for 
one, but others too, prior to that, more speculative, like 
Rorty's (1979), besides specialised investigations into the 
alleged authors of this movement (including Russell, Car-
nap and Wittgenstein), which are extensive and thus can-
not be quoted here completely (see about Carnap and 
logical positivism, Friedman 1999), as well as investiga-
tions of what we might call “historiography of historiogra-
phy” into the same (see  Vienne 1997) ‒ have decon-
structed and demystified the aforementioned proto-
histories. Coffa and Rorty upheld, actually following what 
Quine (1961) had suggested concerning Carnap and (indi-
rectly) his own philosophy, that the roots of the analytical 
movement and the matters it addressed, as is the case, 
essentially, of those which concern the theory of meaning, 
are in the problems introduced originally by ‘continental 
philosophers’, in particular the Kantian distinction between 
the analytical and the synthetic (Coffa) or the epistemo-
logical presupposition that dates back to the modern era 
(Descartes, Locke, Kant), according to which the world can 
be in some way represented and/or mirrored in philosophy 
(Rorty). (That the analytical movement focused ‒ from the 
beginning and in programmatic terms so to speak ‒ its re-
search on the theory of meaning is a thesis that was em-
phasised particularly by Dummett [see Dummett 1978; pp. 
437-458; 1993], which P. Hacker would certainly agree 
with, regarding Wittgenstein [see  Hacker 1996; 2001, pp. 
12-15]. I will return to this topic in the conclusion of my pa-
per.) From this standpoint, the assumption that analytical 
philosophy addressed ‘ab initio' an entirely new problem-
atic, revolutionary and distinct from the old ‘continental phi-
losophy’ is no longer acceptable. In an interpretation like 
Coffa's (according to which it made sense, nevertheless, to 
speak about “analytical philosophy” and even about a tra-
dition of it), when complemented with Rorty's (for whom 
the existence of such philosophy as an autonomous 
movement must be questioned decisively): although ana-
lytical philosophers in general did bring to philosophy, 
unlike the so-called "continental philosophy", the important 
input of logic and the intention of conducting purified re-
search ‒ as far as possible ‒ of both metaphysics and 
epistemology, while seeking to found the theory of mean-
ing on new (naturalist and behaviourist) foundations, the 
truth is that this project resulted in total failure, leading 
(namely Quine, after the work mentioned above, and Witt-
genstein in Philosophical Investigations) to the idea of the 
end of Western philosophy itself, globally and in systematic 
terms ‒ where, in Rorty's interpretation (see Rorty 1979, 
chap. VII) they are in line with some contemporary conti-
nental philosophers, like M. Heidegger and H.-G. 
Gadamer. “Analytical philosophy”, in a representation like 
the one we have traced, started from “continental philoso-
phy” or from the history of philosophy as a whole (where, 
to some extent, it has always been) to return to it, declar-
ing the terminus ad quem thereof, and gaining its true self-
awareness in that context. Therefore, the dichotomy and 
contrast between the two philosophies, which is still in-
comprehensibly celebrated today by historiographers of 
the analytical movement (see Glock 2008), is pointless and 
should be completely reviewed.  
2. Conclusion: Consequences for the study 
of Wittgenstein’s philosophy 
Regarding Wittgenstein, the main outcome of what we are 
saying is that we must avoid reading and interpreting him 
according to meta-historical and meta-philosophical as-
sumptions like those which concern the paradigm of exis-
tence of something which we have been calling, for the 
past three or four decades, "continental philosophy" and 
“analytical philosophy”, hereby reflecting in his philosophy 
the most recent theses of the latter, as if the philosopher 
had worked progressively, from the beginning and without 
knowing it, for a joint heritage and tradition. One good rea-
son for not doing it is that these entities are rather recent 
philosophical constructions, which Wittgenstein himself did 
not get to know and in which ‒ quite conceivably and con-
sidering what we know today about his personality and 
work ‒ he would refuse to be included. More decisively, 
considering the study of Tractatus and Philosophical In-
vestigations, among the theses mentioned above I would 
include the one that M. Dummett upheld, and is now sup-
ported specially by Peter Hacker, that according to which 
the theory of meaning is, fundamentally, what the analyti-
cal movement in general addresses. As already sug-
gested, such thesis is the rather debatable outcome of a 
review or assessment of the analytical movement lead by 
his contemporary heirs and commentators, who aimed to 
refocus or redirect in programmatic terms their own re-
search. As we started off by saying, the same happened to 
previous historiographies of the analytical movement (in 
particular Urmson’s 1962), addressing Wittgenstein's place 
in that movement. I do not mean to say that it is a “false” or 
“wrong” thesis. It is, however, reductionist and simplistic as 
a guideline; it is not merely that ‒ the theory of meaning ‒ 
in Wittgenstein's works, as if he had intended, starting with 
the Tractatus, to develop, either systematically or not, such 
theory and to highlight the limits thereto. The historical and 
philosophical framework of those works is none other than

The “queer resemblance” between aesthetics and philosophy – a 
perspective on Wittgenstein’s philosophical method 
Nuno Ribeiro 
São Carlos, Brazil | nuno.f.ribeiro@sapo.pt 
Abstract 
This paper intends to clarify the importance of aesthetics to the development of Wittgenstein’s philosophical method after his 
return to Cambridge and philosophy in 1929. Indeed, throughout the several classical sources for the study of the Wittgen-
steinian aesthetics, such as the Lectures on Aesthetics, G. E. Moore’s “Wittgenstein’s Lectures in 1930-33”, Wittgenstein’s Lec-
tures: Cambridge, 1932-1935, edited by Alice Ambrose, and the remarks about aesthetics collected in Culture and Value, one 
finds several clues to understand the connection between aesthetics and philosophy, which are the consequence of Wittgen-
stein’s anti-essentialism and anti-Platonism. Thus, bearing in mind Wittgenstein’s critique of essentialism and his anti-platonic 
attitude, it will be clarified the consequences of the Wittgensteinian aesthetic thought to the creation of a new philosophical style 
and, therefore, the development of a new philosophical method. 
 
 
The importance of aesthetics to the development of Witt-
genstein’s philosophical method is expressed in a remark, 
written in 1937 and published in Culture and Value, which 
says:  
The queer resemblance between a philosophical inves-
tigation (perhaps especially in mathematics<)> and one 
in aesthetics. (E.g. what is bad about this garment, how 
it should be, etc…) (Wittgenstein 1998, 29
e) 
In fact, if it’s true that the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus 
reduces aesthetics to silence (Wittgenstein 2001, 86: 
6.421), one finds, after Wittgenstein’s return to Cambridge 
and to philosophy in 1929, a re-evaluation of the problems 
connected to aesthetic thought that not only opens the 
possibility of aesthetic speech, but also presents important 
elements to understand the development of Wittgenstein’s 
philosophical concepts and methodology. The relation be-
tween aesthetics and philosophical concepts is explicitly 
emphasized in a well-known remark, also published in Cul-
ture and Value and written 1949, which says: 
Scientific questions may interest me, but they never 
really grip me. Only conceptual & aesthetic questions 
have that effect on me. At bottom it leaves me cold 
whether scientific problems are solved; but not those 
other questions. (Wittgenstein 1998, 91
e) 
Throughout the several classical sources for the study of 
the Wittgensteinian aesthetics, such as the Lectures on 
Aesthetics (Wittgenstein 1966), G. E. Moore’s “Wittgen-
stein’s Lectures in 1930-33” (Wittgenstein 1993, 45-114) 
and Wittgenstein’s Lectures: Cambridge, 1932-1935 (Witt-
genstein 1979), edited by Alice Ambrose, one finds like-
wise several clues to understand the connection between 
the development of a philosophical investigation and one 
in aesthetics after Wittgenstein’s return to Cambridge and 
to philosophy. An important clue to understand the signifi-
cance of aesthetics to the development of Wittgenstein’s 
philosophy after 1929 is specifically provided by “Wittgen-
stein’s Lectures in 1930-1933”, published by G. E. Moore 
in the years of 1954 and 1955 in “Mind” (Moore 1954; 
Moore 1954a; Moore 1955; Moore 1955a), where one 
reads: 
He [Wittgenstein] introduced his whole discussion of 
Aesthetics by dealing with one problem about the 
meaning of the words, with which he said he had not 
yet dealt. He illustrated this problem by the example of 
the word “game”, with regard to which he said both (1) 
that, even if there is something common to all games, it 
doesn’t follow that this is what we mean by calling a 
particular game a “game”, and (2) that the reason why 
we call so many different activities “games” need not be 
that there is anything common to them all, but only that 
there is “a gradual transition” from one use to another, 
although there may be nothing in common between the 
two ends of the series. And he seemed to hold defi-
nitely that there is nothing in common in our different 
uses of the word “beautiful”, saying that we use it “in a 
hundred different games” – that, e.g. the beauty of a 
face is something different from the beauty of a chair or 
a flower or the binding of a book. (Moore 1955, 17) 
According to Moore’s testimony in “Wittgenstein’s Lectures 
in 1930-1933”, Wittgenstein introduces his discussion of 
aesthetics by dealing with the problem about the meaning 
of words and by illustrating that problem through the ex-
ample of the word “game”. In Wittgenstein’s Lectures: 
Cambridge, 1932-1935, one reads, as well, the following 
excerpt regarding the connection between aesthetics and 
the concept of “game”: 
The word “beauty” is used for a thousand different 
things. Beauty of face is different from that of flowers 
and animals. That one is playing utterly different games 
is evident from the difference that emerges in the dis-
cussion of each. We can only ascertain the meaning of 
the word “beauty” by seeing how we use it. (Wittgen-
stein 1979, 35-36) 
The fact that Wittgenstein chooses the word “game” to il-
lustrate the discussion of aesthetics shows the fundamen-
tal importance of aesthetics to the development of Witt-
genstein’s philosophical concepts after 1929, considering 
that the notion of language games and, therefore, the 
specification of different games would become the centre 
of Wittgenstein’s philosophy after his return to Cambridge.  
Wittgenstein’s discussion of aesthetics in the 1930s must 
be understood in the context of the critique of essentialism 
in aesthetics, which is the subject of Terry Diffey’s chapter 
published in Wittgenstein, Aesthetics and Philosophy with 
the title “Wittgenstein, Anti-essentialism and the Definition 
of Art” (Lewis 2004, 37-51). Essentialism in aesthetics is 
characterized by the tendency to consider the adjective 
“beautiful” as a property common to a universe of objects, 
that is, a property or attribute belonging to a group of ob-
jects considered as the beautiful ones. That’s exactly what 
one reads in the beginning of the Lectures on Aesthetics: 

The “queer resemblance” between aesthetics and philosophy – a perspective on Wittgenstein’s philosophical method | Nuno Ribeiro 
 
 
 
225
The subject (Aesthetics) is very big and entirely misun-
derstood as far as I can see. The use of such a word as 
‘beautiful’ is even more apt to be misunderstood if you 
look at the linguistic form of sentences in which it oc-
curs than most other words. ‘Beautiful’ [and ‘good’ – R] 
is an adjective, so you are inclined to say: “This has a 
certain quality, that of being beautiful”. (Wittgenstein 
1966, 1) 
The critique of essentialism in aesthetics appears in the 
context of Wittgenstein’s anti-platonic attitude. Wittgen-
stein’s anti-Platonism consists in the critique of the idea 
that looking for the essence of things is like looking for in-
gredients in a mixture, as if qualities were ingredients of 
things. That’s exactly what one reads in the following ex-
cerpt of Wittgenstein’s Lectures: Cambridge, 1932-1935, in 
the context of the discussion about ethics and aesthetics: 
Plato’s talk of looking for the essence of things was 
very like talk of looking for the ingredients in a mixture, 
as though qualities were ingredients of things. But to 
speak of a mixture, say of red and green colors, is not 
like speaking of a mixture of a paint which has red and 
green paints as ingredients. (Wittgenstein 1979, 34) 
But the connection between aesthetics and the develop-
ment of Wittgenstein’s concepts and philosophical method 
after 1929 has yet another level. That level is related to the 
problem of Wittgenstein’s philosophical style.  
In a remark, written in 1948 and published in Culture and 
Value, one reads the following statement: “Nothing is more 
important though than the construction of fictional con-
cepts, which will teach us at least to understand our own.” 
(Wittgenstein 1998, 85e) According to this remark the con-
struction of fictional concepts is an important way to un-
derstand the development of our own concepts. The crea-
tion of fictional concepts in Wittgenstein’s philosophy is 
expressed through the creation of fictional language 
games. In fact, in the Remarks on Colour (Part III, remark 
115) one reads: “I say: The Person who cannot play this 
game does not have this concept.” (Wittgenstein 1977, 
31
e) If possessing a concept presupposes playing a game, 
the creation of fictional concepts means the creation of 
fictional language games, in other words, the creation of 
“aesthetic language games” (Ribeiro 2013), and that is 
probably one of the reasons why Wittgenstein, according 
to Moore’s “Wittgenstein’s Lectures in 1930-1933”, intro-
duces his whole discussion of aesthetics illustrating the 
problems related to the aesthetic domain through the ex-
ample of the word “game”.  
Indeed, one of the commonest means employed by 
Wittgenstein to develop his concepts is the creation of fic-
tional language games. Throughout the several manu-
scripts and typescripts, written after 1929 and left in Witt-
genstein’s Nachlass (Wittgenstein 2000), one finds a plu-
rality of examples of the aesthetic construction of fictional 
language games, created in order to illustrate and prove 
Wittgenstein’s philosophical thought about language. One 
finds a clear example of this in the several versions of the 
Philosophical Investigations, a work which is structured – 
from its earlier versions – on the construction of fictional 
languages games, as one can clearly see through the 
comparison of the several stages of the Philosophical In-
vestigations presented in Joachim Schulte’s Philoso-
phische 
Untersuchungen: 
Kritisch-genetische 
Edition 
(Wittgenstein 2001). Thus, Wittgenstein’s research of the 
morphology of the use of an expression is produced and 
suggested through the invention of new language games 
that provide us new ways of looking at a concept. In fact, 
according to Norman Malcolm’s Ludwig Wittgenstein: A 
memoir, Wittgenstein in his lectures on philosophical psy-
chology – delivered in the years of 1946 and 1947 (Witt-
genstein 1988) – said: 
What I give is the morphology of the use of an expres-
sion. I show that it has kinds of uses of which you had 
not dreamed. In philosophy one feels forced to look at a 
concept in a certain way. What I do is to suggest, or 
even invent, other ways of looking at it. I suggest possi-
bilities of which you had not previously thought. You 
thought that there was one possibility, or only two at 
most. But I made you think of others. Furthermore, I 
made you see that it was absurd to expect the concept 
to conform to those narrow possibilities. Thus your 
mental cramp is relieved, and you are free to look 
around the field of use of the expression and to de-
scribe the different kinds of uses of it. (Malcolm 2001, 
43) 
In this text, corresponding to a note taken down by Nor-
man Malcolm, one finds a clear explanation of how Witt-
genstein’s morphological method is characterized by the 
creation of new language games. In order to create other 
ways of looking at a concept one must suggest and even 
invent new possibilities of thinking and looking at that con-
cept. In Philosophical Investigations, remark 492, one 
reads an important clue regarding that subject: 
To invent a language could mean to invent a device for 
a particular purpose on the basis of the laws of nature 
(or consistently with them); but it also has the other 
sense, analogous to that in which we speak of the in-
vention of a game. 
Here I am saying something about the grammar of the 
word “language”, by connecting it with the grammar of 
the word “invent”. (Wittgenstein 2009, 145e) 
In this remark, Wittgenstein explicitly establishes the con-
nection between the grammar of the word “language” and 
the grammar of the word “invent”, featuring the creative 
possibility of inventing a game. That is probably why in 
another remark, published in Culture and Value and writ-
ten around 1933-1934, Wittgenstein writes: “I believe I 
summed up where I stand in relation to philosophy when I 
said: really one should write philosophy only as one writes 
a poem.” (Wittgenstein 1998, 28
e) The comparison be-
tween philosophy and poetry is also mentioned in “Witt-
genstein’s Saturday Discussions: 1946-1947” – published 
in Public and Private Occasions – where one reads: “A 
philosophical problem is deep in the way that a poem or a 
face or a piece of music is deep.” (Wittgenstein 2003, 401) 
But in the case of Wittgenstein’s philosophical method to 
write philosophy as one writes a poem is achieved through 
the aesthetic composition of new language games that 
open new possibilities of looking at concepts and even in-
vent, in many cases, new concepts. In this manner, phi-
losophy creates new possibilities of looking at things with 
the purpose of relieving the “mental cramp”, that is, with 
the purpose of freeing us from the “misleading analogies” 
(Wittgenstein 2005, 302
e), to mention an expression used 
by Wittgenstein in The Big Typescript to describe the task 
of philosophy. This is perhaps one of the most important 
reasons why Wittgenstein emphasises the “queer resem-
blance” between aesthetics and philosophy.

Im Ausgang von Ludwig Wittgensteins non-kognitivistischen Einwänden gegenüber einer Ethik im Tractatus logico-
philosophicus (TLP) werde ich zeigen, dass Wittgensteins Überlegungen zum Regelfolgen in den Philosophischen 
Untersuchungen (PU) eine Aufgabe des non-kognitivistischen Standpunktes beinhalten. Im Ausgang von John McDowell und 
Aristoteles können Wittgensteins Erörterungen aber auch genutzt werden, um zu zeigen, dass die Instanz ethischen Urteilens 
dann in einer spezifischen Fähigkeit liegt: der φρόνησις. 
 
 
1. Problemaufriss 
Ludwig Wittgenstein führt in seinem Vortrag über Ethik die 
Ausdrücke „ethische[r] Satz“ und „ethisches Urteil“ ein 
(Wittgenstein 1989, 12). Ich werde im Folgenden zeigen, 
dass er im Tractatus logico-philosophicus (TLP) einen non-
kognitivistischen Standpunkt vertritt, d.h. ob diese Sätze 
überhaupt etwas aussagen können, also ob sie Bedeutung 
haben. John McDowell zeigt dann in seinem Aufsatz Virtue 
and Reason, dass das Regelfolgen gerade gegen non-
kognitivistische Einwände verteidigt werden kann. Es 
scheint also, dass Wittgenstein hier einen anderen Ansatz 
in der Ethik vertreten könnte, der von ihm nicht expliziert 
worden ist. Ich werde im Ausgang von McDowell und der 
Nikomachischen Ethik des Aristoteles einen möglichen 
Vorschlag skizzieren, den man aus Wittgensteins Überle-
gungen zum Regelfolgen entnehmen kann und die Instanz 
ethischen Urteilens in einer spezifischen Fähigkeit des 
Subjekts verorten: der φρόνησις. 
2. Ethische Sätze vs. Aussagesätze 
Wittgensteins Überlegungen im TLP sind uneindeutig, was 
die Möglichkeit einer Ethik betrifft, denn zum einen schreibt 
er, dass der „Wert […] außerhalb alles Geschehens und 
So-Seins liegen“ muss (vgl. TLP, 6.41). Da die Werte au-
ßerhalb des So-Seins sein müssten, könnte es sich um 
eine Art metaphysischer Fakten handeln, aber Wittgen-
stein schließt dies wohl aus und schreibt, dass es „keine 
Sätze der Ethik geben“ kann. „Sätze können nichts Höhe-
res ausdrücken“ (TLP, 6.42). Und: „Es ist klar, daß sich die 
Ethik nicht aussprechen läßt“ (TLP, 6.43). Damit wäre 
meine Untersuchung hier beendet, aber zum anderen 
schreibt er: „Die Ethik ist transzendental“ (TLP, 6.43). Er 
prädiziert dies auch von der Logik („Die Logik ist transzen-
dental“ (TLP, 6.13)).  Ich will an dieser Stelle die Paralleli-
sierung von Logik und Ethik bei Wittgenstein nicht weiter 
verfolgen und mich stattdessen darauf beschränken, wel-
ches Zugrundeliegende Wittgenstein für ethische Sätze 
ausschließt, d.h. was ihnen nicht Bedeutung verleiht.  
3. Können ethische Sätze bedeutungsvoll 
sein? 
(1.) Ethische Sätze drücken kein So-Sein aus, d.h. Tatsa-
chen sind keine Wahrmacher ethischer Sätze. Dies würde 
ja auch die Sein-Sollen-Differenz aufheben.
1 (2.) Ethische 
Sätze können nicht durch Sanktionen als ethisch ausge-
zeichnet werden. Die „Folgen einer Handlung“, also „Strafe 
                                                      
1 Ich argumentiere hier nicht für die einzelnen Punkte, sondern liste sie nur 
auf; auch Wittgensteins Äußerungen im TLP sind nicht ‚umfangreichʻ argu-
mentativ unterfüttert. 
und Lohn“, wären auch wieder „Ereignisse“ in der Welt und 
beträfen das So-Sein (vgl. TLP, 6.422). (3.) Aber auch der 
„Wille“ kann nicht „Träger des Ethischen“ sein, denn „als 
Phänomen“ ist er auch nur ein So-Sein in der Welt und nur 
für die Psychologie von Interesse (vgl. TLP, 6.423). Witt-
genstein spricht sich somit gegen einen Naturalismus, ei-
nen Behaviorismus und einen Psychologismus aus.  
Man könnte noch weitere Möglichkeiten anführen, auf 
die sich Wittgenstein nicht explizit bezieht. (4.) Es wäre 
davon auszugehen, dass dem Willen etwas Übernatürli-
ches zugrunde liegt und zwar im Sinne eines cartesischen 
Subjektes oder (5.) den ethischen Sätzen liegen Werte als 
metaphysische „Fakten“ zugrunde. Ich denke, dass Witt-
genstein auch diese Möglichkeiten ausschließen würde (s. 
auch oben). Wie es mir scheint argumentiert er generell 
gegen Ontisierungen in der Ethik, d.h. jegliche Versuche 
ontische Zustände als bedeutungsverleihend für ethische 
Sätze anzunehmen sind zum scheitern verurteilt, d.h. Witt-
genstein vertritt einen non-kogntivistischen Standpunkt. 
Ich will nun einen weiteren Kandidaten betrachten, der 
auch problematisch ist und von da zu Aristoteles überge-
hen.    
4. Sind ethische Sätze kodifizierbare Re-
geln? 
Man könnte auch behaupten, dass es sich bei ethischen 
Sätzen um Regeln handelt, die Handlungsgründe ausdrü-
cken. Mit dieser Problemstellung wäre aber auch das sog. 
„Regelfolgeproblem“ angesprochen und ich will hier weder 
in die sehr weit verzweigte Debatte zu diesem Problem 
einsteigen – auch auf die Gefahr hin nicht mehr herauszu-
kommen – noch Stellung zur Unterscheidung von Früh-
werk und Spätwerk bei Wittgenstein beziehen. Gäbe es 
zumindest ethische Sätze, die Regeln ausdrücken, dann 
würden sie das So-Sein der Welt nicht verändern: 
„Wenn das gute oder böse Wollen die Welt ändert, so 
kann es nur die Grenzen der Welt ändern, nicht die 
Tatsachen; nicht das was durch die Sprache ausge-
drückt werden kann. 
Kurz, die Welt muß dann dadurch überhaupt eine ande-
re werden. Sie muß sozusagen als Ganzes abnehmen 
oder zunehmen“ (TLP, 6.43). 
Hier besteht ein Dilemma, denn man kann Handlungen 
entweder als Ereignisse betrachten, die in sachhaltigen 
Aussagesätzen ausgedrückt werden, also lediglich das 
So-Sein beschreiben oder dass Handlungen zwar ethische 
Regeln zugrunde liegen, diese aber keinen „Einfluss“ auf 
die Welt haben. Im ersten Fall würde man wohl nicht von 
Handlungen sprechen, die in irgendeiner Weise ethisch

 228
oder wenigstens normativ sind, sondern lediglich deskriptiv 
und im zweiten Fall wären sie auch nicht normativ, denn 
sie sind ‚wirkungslosʻ
2. Aber, abgesehen von ihrer „Wir-
kungslosigkeit“, was würde den ethischen Regeln im zwei-
ten Fall Bedeutung verleihen? Wäre man damit nicht wie-
der auf die Kandidaten zurückgeworfen, die oben schon 
als verfehlt abgehandelt wurden? 
McDowell geht in seinem Aufsatz Virtue and Reason vor 
allem auf non-kognitivistische Einwände ein, die behaup-
ten, dass zur Wahrnehmung einer Situation noch ein ap-
petitiver Zustand hinzukommen muss, der die Handlung 
auslöst oder veranlasst (vgl. McDowell 1998, 70). Dieser 
würde dann als allgemeine Formel ausgedrückt werden 
können, d.h. als handlungsleitende Prämisse. D.h. nur der 
„orektische psychische Zustand“ hat die „motvierende 
Kraft“ (ein „extra Faktor“ als ein „Zustand des Willens“) 
eine Handlung zu veranlassen. McDowell wendet dagegen 
ein, dass solche Oberprämissen in einem praktischen Syl-
logismus überhaupt nicht „kodifizierbar“ seien, wobei es 
hier wohl eher zweitrangig ist, ob eben diese Prämisse 
einen psychischen Zustand repräsentiert, der eine motivie-
rende Kraft als Regel ausdrückt oder übergreifender eine 
Art Lebensentwurf im Anschluss an Aristoteles. Der Hang 
oder die Neigung kodifizierbare Prämissen aufzustellen 
beruht auf einer „Illusion“, die einem „deduktiven Paradig-
ma“ folgt. McDowells Kritik an diesem Paradigma erläutert 
er anhand Wittgensteins „Regelfolgeproblem“: McDowell 
geht es vor allem darum zu zeigen was für ein „Bild“ wir 
uns vom Regelfolgen machen, d.h. was für eine Vorstel-
lung dem Regelfolgen zugrunde liegt. Es ist das „Bild ei-
nes psychischen Mechanismus“ der anhand eines „Analo-
gieschlusses“ nach dem Vorbild eines „physischen Me-
chanismus“ vorgestellt wird. Beim Regelfolgen kommt es 
uns aber nur so vor als wäre es „vermittelt“ durch den 
„postulierten psychischen Mechanismus“. Statt allgemeiner 
Formeln beruht das Regelfolgen auf der Teilnahme an 
„gemeinsamen Lebensformen“ und das richtige Fortsetzen 
der Regel wird eigentlich lediglich durch ein „Verständnis 
des speziellen Falles“ ‚abgesichertʻ oder ‚garantiertʻ, das 
durch Beispiele oder Appelle an den Unverständnis äu-
ßernden und zu belehrenden Hörer vermittelt wird. McDo-
well will uns dabei vor allem von der „Illusion“ befreien, 
dass wir unsere Handlungserklärungen in einem „dedukti-
ven Paradigma“ vorstellen, um sicherzustellen, dass auch 
ja ‚immerʻ einer Regel gefolgt wird. Wenn seine „Kur“ an-
schlägt oder „wirksam“ ist, dann wird nicht mehr benötigt 
als die „Wahrnehmung“ einer Situation, um eine Handlung 
auszulösen und einen Grund zu ‚habenʻ (vgl. McDowell 
1998, 57-71). 
Eine Lesart, die diesen Vorschlag McDowells stützt, 
könnte auch anführen, dass die kodifizierten Regeln eine 
weitere Regel zur Anwendung benötigen, denn Regeln 
sind immer allgemein und würden für die Anwendung auf 
die spezifische Situation etwas benötigen, das hinzu-
kommt und dies wäre eine weitere Regel als vermittelnde 
Instanz. Die Aufstellung einer solchen Metaregel würde 
aber auch wieder eine weitere Regel zur Anwendung be-
nötigen und man gerät so in einen infiniten Regress (vgl. 
hierzu auch Brandom 1994, 18-21). Weder ein psychischer 
Mechanismus innerhalb eines deduktiven Paradigmas 
noch eine Metaregel garantieren als vermittelnde Instan-
zen das Regelfolgen, sondern nur das „Verständnis“ („ap-
preciation“) (McDowell 1998, 63f.) der Situation, das allein 
schon durch einzelne Hinweise in Form von Beispielen 
oder Appellen das Folgen der Regel vermittelt und das 
                                                      
2 Dies betrifft zumindest ihre Wirkungslosigkeit auf die Welt des So-Seins und 
nicht die Grenzen der Welt, wie Wittgenstein ja ausführt. Ich werde auf diesen 
Punkt nicht weiter eingehen, der in der Metaethik unter der Gegenüberstellung 
von „Internalismus“ und „Externalismus“ behandelt wird. 
beim Folgenden selbst, wie auch beim zu Belehrenden, 
der zum Regelfolgen aufgefordert wird. Die Bedeutung des 
ethischen Satzes als Regel, die motivierende Handlungs-
gründe kodifiziert, kann also weder über eine Metaregel 
noch über einen psychischen Mechanismus verliehen 
werden
3, die dem Regelfolgen zugrunde liegen sollen, 
aber McDowells Rückgriff auf Aristoteles legt eine weitere 
Möglichkeit nahe und zwar das ethische Urteilen als Aus-
druck einer Fähigkeit zu verstehen. 
5. Aristoteles  
Ethisches Handlungswissen kann also nicht in allgemei-
nen Formeln oder Titelsätzen ausgedrückt werden, die ja 
z.B. auch zur Orientierung dienen könnten, aber sie kön-
nen ein Orientierungswissen nicht repräsentieren, da dies 
nicht allgemein sein kann, sondern situativ sein muss und 
dabei auf eine Fähigkeit verweist: die φρόνησις. Aristoteles 
führt diese im sechsten Buch seiner Nikomachischen Ethik 
(EN) ein. Sie ist eine „Verstandestugend“, die durch „Be-
lehrung“ vermittelt wird und „bedarf deshalb der Erfahrung 
und der Zeit“ (vgl. EN II 1, 1103a).
4 Dies scheint auch in 
die Richtung von McDowells Überlegungen zu gehen, der 
sich in seiner Diskussion der Regefolgeproblematik aber 
eher an Wittgensteins Terminologie abarbeitet. Zudem 
handelt es bei der φρόνησις um ein praktisches Wissen, 
denn sie ist eine der Weisen mit der die Seele „die Wahr-
heit trifft“ (vgl. EN VI 3, 1139b). Des Weiteren beruht sie 
auf „Überlegung“, da sie auf das „veränderliche Sein“ geht, 
denn „[n]iemand berät sich über das was gar nicht anders 
sein kann als es ist“ (EN VI 2, 1139a).
5 Dies scheint aber 
problematisch zu sein, da hier eine Art von Abwägen (von 
Gründen) ins Spiel kommt, die McDowell zumindest ab-
lehnt. Er will einen wirklichen oder wahren Handlungs-
grund dahingehend verstanden wissen, dass er andere 
Gründe „verstummen“ („silencing“) lässt, denn ansonsten 
wäre die Unterscheidung zwischen jemandem der sich 
zum Handeln zwingt, einer lediglich beherrschten Person 
und einem aus Tugend Handelnden hinfällig (vgl. McDo-
well 1998, 55/56).  
Da nun aber schon verschiedene Kandidaten ausge-
schieden sind, um ethischen Sätzen Bedeutung zu verlei-
hen oder als Handlungsgründe aufzutreten, seien es non-
kognitivistische appetitive Zustände oder auch Fakten, 
bleibt die Frage ob es Handlungsgründe im Rahmen der 
φρόνησις geben kann, diese also nicht grundlos sei oder 
bloß ein akzidentelles Verhalten produziere. Es kann sich 
bei dieser Fähigkeit aber auch nicht um ein glückliches 
Erraten handeln: 
„Das Wohlüberlegtsein [euboulía] ist eine Art Überlegen 
[boulé], und wer überlegt, sucht etwas und zieht 
Schlüsse. Aber auch ein glückliches Erraten ist es 
nicht. Denn dieses ist kein Nachdenken, sondern die 
rasche Eingebung des Augenblicks, während das Über-
legen Zeit kostet“ (EN VI 10, 1142a/b (übersetzt von 
Gadamer) und vgl. McDowell 1998, 64). 
Laut Aristoteles macht es einen Unterschied gemäß ei-
nes Grundes zu handelt, was wohl eher auf eine be-
herrschte Person zutreffen würde, die sich zum Handeln 
zwingt und aus einem Grund heraus zu handeln, wie es 
einer tugendhaften Person zukommen soll:  
                                                      
3 Auf Brandoms Vorschlag, stattdessen implizite Normen anzunehmen, gehe 
ich hier nicht ein (vgl. Brandom, 1994, Kapitel 1). 
4 Ich werde hier nicht den gesamten ‚Begriffsapparatʻ der aristotelischen Ethik 
einführen, sondern nur punktuell für meine Zwecke Stellen auswählen. 
5 „Überlegen und Sich-Beraten ist ein- und dasselbe“ (EN VI 2, 1139a).

„Es ist nicht die Haltung [ἕξις] Tugend [ἀρετή], die ge-
mäß oder um willen rechter Gründe ist [κατὰ τὸν ὀρθὸν 
λόγον], sondern die mit rechten Gründen [μετὰ τοῦ 
ὀρθοῦ λόγου]“ (EN VI 13, 1144b 26/27 (griechischer 
Text entstammt Aristoteles 1998)). 
D.h. sie sind schon in der Haltung der tugendhaften Per-
son ‚vorhandenʻ, denn der Ausdruck der Haltung im Han-
deln ist dann im Sinne der πρᾶξις und nicht im Sinne der 
ποίησις, die um willen ihrer Gründe ausgedrückt wird. Zwei 
wichtige Hinweise seien hier gegeben: (1.) Es handelt sich 
dabei nicht um zwei verschiedene Handlungsereignisse 
(extensionale Lesart), sondern um zwei Hinsichten auf 
dieselbe Handlung (intensionale Lesart)  (vgl. Hubig 2006, 
50-53). (2.) Dass Gründe schon in der Haltung sind oder 
irgendwie angelegt oder inhärieren, ist keine Ontisierung 
dieser Gründe, sondern eher eine uneigentliche Aus-
drucksweise. Man könnte wohl eher sagen: die Haltung ist 
vernünftig. Hier kommt man aber schon an die Grenzen 
ethischer Ausdrucksweisen, wie sie auch Wittgenstein in 
seinem Vortrag über Ethik thematisiert. 
6. Fazit 
Aber auch die φρόνησις ist als Fähigkeit ein Phänomen, 
das selbst der Gefahr einer Ontisierung anheim fallen 
kann, wenn sie lediglich als eine verlässliche Disposition in 
einem mechanistisch-deduktiven Paradigma verstanden 
wird. Gerade gegen eine solche Ontisierung wendet sich 
meines Erachtens McDowell. Dass dabei das Fragen für 
den Moment zur Ruhe kommt, ist aber etwas anderes als 
das Beruhen auf und Beruhigen durch ontische Begrün-
dungsstopper. Sprache, Ethik, Lebensform oder φρόνησις 
(als situatives Orientierungswissen) müssen immer wieder 
von solchen Ontisierungen kuriert werden, denn diese sind 
ständige Begleiter unserer Ausdrucksweisen, was wohl an 
der sinnfälligen Herkunft der Prädikate hängt.

peutische Aspekt des Philosophierens, wie auch der me-
taphorische Aspekt der Sprache, führen aber zu weit, um 
sie hier weiter auszuführen.

The method of phenomenological analysis  
(with some reference to Franz Brentano) 
Tina Röck 
Innsbruck, Austria | tina.roeck@uibk.ac.at 
Abstract 
To many philosophers the rift between phenomenology and analytical philosophy may seem too deep to traverse. But both tra-
ditions can trace some of their heritage back to a common source - the work of Franz Brentano. In Brentano the methods of de-
scription (phenomenology) and analysis were integrated in order to render philosophy a strict science. First I will distinguish 
phenomenology from analytic explanation and show some of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Then I will briefly 
indicate how Brentano combined these methods in such a fashion as to curb their weaknesses and enhance their strengths. 
The goal of this paper is to hint at an option of a fruitful integration of these methods that might inspire philosophers to bridge 
the mentioned rift within contemporary philosophy. 
 
 
1. The difference between description and 
analysis – strengths and weaknesses 
Brentano was convinced that in order to free philosophy 
from its fatal entanglement with idealism and speculation 
and to render it an exact science, any philosophical inves-
tigation has to begin with a thorough description of its ob-
ject. Thus the primary goal of phenomenology (which de-
veloped from this descriptive impetus of Brentano’s 
thought) is description. Its purpose is either to provide un-
derstanding, or to let other people notice some phenome-
non that previously escaped their notice.  
Brentano (as well as his student Husserl) was convinced 
that reductive explanations, so prevalent in philosophy and 
science in their time and in ours, cannot yield adequate 
understanding. An object is neither understood by reduc-
ing it to its material aspect nor by referring to the general 
laws governing it. Also a pure understanding of its causes 
is not enough. All these forms of explanation through re-
duction do not help us point out or describe the given phe-
nomenon. On the contrary, any analysis or reductive ex-
planation of an object tends to lead us astray. Instead of 
focusing on the object, we focus on its relevant elements, 
its material basis, or whatever we reduce it to. Husserl de-
nies explicitly that any explanatory reduction of phenom-
ena aids our understanding. Who would seriously contend, 
he claims, that natural laws or microscopic facts are 
clearer or easier to understand than the macroscopic facts 
of our everyday experience? The reduction to the compo-
nents, the nomological or the microscopic might help to 
explain reality, but it does not help to understand the world 
we experience. In order to notice and understand phe-
nomena as they are, we need a new and non-reductive 
method, namely descriptive philosophy or phenomenology. 
Let’s say one wanted to know more about the nature of 
thoughts. A phenomenologist then would begin by observ-
ing the way one experiences a thought, by looking at the 
way thoughts present themselves, at how it feels to have a 
thought, at its intentional structure and so on. This leads to 
a description that should only account for what has been 
encountered, without explaining (i.e. reducing) it. Then the 
phenomenologist would describe other thoughts in the 
same fashion, or compare these descriptions to descrip-
tions other phenomenologists have provided. These differ-
ent descriptions will have similarities and differences that 
enable us to group all the thoughts that are similar (in a 
certain aspect). This aspect that is found in various de-
scriptions of thought can be named to make reference 
easier. Thus a general term has been introduced. The ex-
periences and descriptions of thoughts can then be or-
dered according to these terms and more and more gen-
eral terms can be introduced. In this way an intersubjective 
order emerges. The original diversity of singular experi-
ences of subjective thoughts is inductively bundled into 
concepts that can be used to talk about the thoughts in a 
more adequate fashion. They can also be helpful in order 
to attribute certain general properties to specific thoughts, 
or to inductively generalize about the nature of thoughts as 
such.  
But ultimately this kind of description of singular thoughts 
just states the given, even if it states the given in an or-
dered fashion. The abstract concepts that were introduced 
to order the plurality of facts are only gained by comparing 
facts – they entail nothing further then what can be known 
by looking at the facts. This might be considered the 
weakness of phenomenology. Furthermore the general 
concepts, because they themselves are only generalisa-
tions, do not imply necessity: These general terms will hold 
for most singular instances, but not necessarily for all. So 
this descriptive and inductive method cannot lead to cer-
tainty about anything.1 But it can help to dispel prejudices 
by describing phenomena as they are and because of its 
focus on the concrete singular phenomena, phenomenol-
ogy can make usually overlooked phenomena noticeable. 
Furthermore it is a method that can help us order the phe-
nomena adequately.  
An explanation of thought based on reduction and 
analysis, however, might begin with the attempt to show 
how the material basis (the brain) can give rise to 
thoughts, or with finding the natural laws that govern 
thought. Let’s say one adopts the explanative method of 
reducing thoughts to their material basis, the brain. One 
could then start with the wondrous capacity of the brain to 
generate thoughts and, in the next step, move on to ex-
plain this fact by considering the sheer complexity and 
adaptability of the brain and its components. The actual 
object of our investigation itself, the thought, seems to 
‘disappear’ behind its material basis and/or its nomological 
and causal relations, which are the focus of this type of 
investigation. The investigated object has changed. We 
now look at the material basis (the brain) to explain our 
actual object of investigation (the thought). But we do not 
stop at the brain. We actually look at its complexity in order 
to explain how the material brain can give rise to mentality. 
                                                      
1 With the exception of mental phenomena (i.e. their intentional structure and 
the like).

231
So now our object is not the brain as such but only its 
complex structure, which - combined with certain laws - 
could explain thoughts. But then we need to look at the 
laws that govern the complexity in order to understand the 
thought. So again our focus has shifted. And so on ad infi-
nitum. This practice relates the (general) facts of the men-
tal character of thoughts to other (general) facts like the 
complexity of neuronal organisation, the law-like structure 
of the neuronal interactions and so on. This way a certain 
type of explanation is achieved, where ideally every single 
causally relevant aspect has its place in the chain of 
causal connections. But all this work does not help us in 
understanding what a thought as such is – the thought it-
self wasn’t even the object of our investigation. Even 
though this investigation begins with the same fact, the 
thought, the actual analysis is not concerned with what is 
encountered (the thought) at all, but with a reduction to 
and analysis of what is considered (either by science or 
society, or even by one’s peers) to be a necessary condi-
tion of or essential for the investigated object.  
The general tendency of analysis
2 and explanation to 
lead away from the given phenomenon is augmented in 
contemporary analytic philosophy, since the investigative 
focus of analytic philosophy is generally not even the ma-
terial or causal basis of the given object, but the proposi-
tional content of mental acts about the material or causal 
basis of the object and its ‘objective’ expression in lan-
guage. So what is usually analysed is not the thing that we 
experience, and not even its material, causal or nomologi-
cal basis, but our statements or judgements about this ba-
sis.
3 
Whereas on the one hand the method of phenomenol-
ogy is focused on describing what there is in order to make 
it noticeable and understandable, the second method, on 
the other hand, in its contemporary form of analytic phi-
losophy is focused on the material basis and causal and 
nomological relations as they are expressed in sentences, 
judgements or propositions. It is evident that both methods 
are tailor-made to investigate specific types of objects and 
yield specific types of results (understanding or explana-
tions) with as much exactitude as possible. But this fo-
cused specialisation turns into a weakness if these meth-
ods are used for other objects or different investigative 
purposes - a shortcoming that could be compensated by 
combining these methods in an appropriate way. Bren-
tano’s methodology can serve as an example of how such 
a combination could be achieved.  
2. Brentano’s integrative method  
Brentano argues time and again that the true method of 
philosophy is analogous to the method of the inductive 
natural sciences. But natural science does not only have 
one method. It involves the inductive aspect of starting 
with observation, the mediating aspect of fixing hypothesis 
and finally a deductive and analytical aspect. In Brentano’s 
philosophy we can find all of these aspects of inductive 
science: Brentano on the one hand famously favoured de-
scription over explanation and he talked about the need of 
an investigation to adapt to the objects investigated (‘sich 
dem Gegenstande anpasse[n]’ – Brentano, 1929: 78). The 
                                                      
2 This method of analytic explanation is central for analytic philosophy, but its 
use is not restricted to analytic philosophy. Since obviously there is a differ-
ence between the reductive analysis of explanations of things and the linguis-
tic analysis of sentences about things. But for the present purpose these 
methods are sufficiently similar in the relevant aspects, so that a (rigorous) 
distinction does not seem to be necessary. 
3 This so called ‘linguistic turn’ is largely justified by Frege’s claim that the 
philosophically relevant aspects of reality are not experiential, i.e. not psycho-
logical at all, but semantic.  
importance of the rational-deductive aspect on the other 
hand is evident in Brentano’s attempt to formulate a sys-
tematic ontology, in his insistence that descriptive psychol-
ogy leads to apodictic truths (Kraus, 1924: 288), or his at-
tempt to reform logic. 
With this ideal of natural science in mind Brentano de-
veloped some methodological steps any descriptive psy-
chologist has to follow to render philosophy an exact sci-
ence: 
(a) He has to experience [erleben], 
(b) he has to notice [bemerken], 
(c) he has to fix [fixieren] what he notices, in order to 
collect it, 
(d) he has to generalize inductively; 
(e) where the necessity or impossibility of a unification 
of certain elements becomes clear from the concepts 
themselves, he must intuitively grasp these general 
laws; 
(f) finally, we can add that he has to make deductive 
use of what he gained, […].(Brentano, 1995: 31f) 
It is obvious that the first of these steps can only be 
achieved through a descriptive approach, while the latter 
steps are more suited to an analytical approach. But most 
interesting is the mediating step c) to fix what has been 
noticed, where the descriptive result is transformed into 
something that can be tackled with analytical tools.  
But also for the second step (to notice), both methods 
can be useful, since noticing is usually prevented by pre-
conceptions and habits. “It is curious how often they [hab-
its] have prevented important scientists from noticing rela-
tively simple things.” (Brentano, 1995: 44) One example for 
a linguistic habit is that sometimes we lack a word to ex-
press something. And if there is no linguistic expression for 
a phenomenon, we often fail to notice it in our investiga-
tion. The only way to notice a phenomenon in this case is 
to disregard language and to focus on experience. (Bren-
tano, 1995: 44f) Brentano also mentions our tendency to 
presuppose that the same expression always refers to the 
same process or aspect as a linguistic habit. (Brentano, 
1995: 44) This type of linguistic prejudice can only be dis-
pelled adequately by analysing the different uses of the 
same expression in different circumstances.  
3. Summary 
What ultimately separates phenomenology from analytical 
philosophy is not the rigour or the scientific method, but 
the way the object of investigation is approached (as a 
phenomenon or as the meaning of a sentence). For vari-
ous reasons Phenomenologists contend that we can in-
vestigate the things themselves by looking at the way 
these things are present as phenomena. And we can de-
scribe these objects with a great degree of exactitude. This 
focus of phenomenology is evident in Husserl’s famous 
dictum: “Zu den Sachen selbst.” The thing as it shows itself 
is considered true – in the sense of aletheia, which must 
not be confused with the correctness of a sentence. Gen-
erally speaking it is of little importance to a phenomenolo-
gist whether the singular descriptive sentences themselves 
are correct or not. The ultimate criterion for the quality of 
phenomenological-descriptive sentences is only how ade-
quately they describe the true object of the phenomenol-
ogical investigation. Proponents of the analytical method 
usually do not understand their investigations as an at-

tempt to grasp an object; instead they see their task in 
clarifying thoughts or propositions about objects by analys-
ing their various expressions. Not the phenomenon and 
how it appears to the subject is relevant, but the semantic 
content of thoughts and sentences.
4 
This difference in the object of investigation leads to utter 
confusion when phenomenologists and analytical philoso-
phers try to communicate. To dispel this confusion on the 
one hand some kind of collaboration is needed that can 
help phenomenologists to fix their sentences in such a way 
that they can become relevant for a larger audience not 
educated in the phenomenological method and its habit of 
‘bending of language’ in order to fix descriptions more ac-
curately. So for example it could be helpful to submit fixed 
descriptions to a rigorous linguistic analysis, as it was the 
case in Brentano and Husserl. On the other hand analyti-
cal philosophers tend to forget about what they attempt to 
explain, namely the reality we live in and not some realm 
of fully understandable meaning. Here Brentano’s advice 
to adapt to the object of investigation and to stick with it by 
describing it, before attempting to explain or analyse it 
could be very helpful in order not to get carried away with 
logical possibilities that might never become relevant.  
Nowadays we have to concede that even such an inte-
grative approach might never lead to philosophy as an ex-
act science, if an exact science is understood as a kind of 
science that leads to absolute, unchanging and objective 
knowledge. But it could lead to a philosophy that is just as 
rigorous, creative and innovative as any other scientific 
research, if scientific research is considered a constantly 
changing and developing attempt to find out as much as 
we possibly can. 
                                                      
4 I am not denying that analytic philosophers have worked extensively on the 
questions of how these relate to the world, or the actual states of affairs. All I 
am claiming is that the focal point of these investigations mostly is language, 
thought or proposition about actual states of affairs and not the states as such.

Unhintergehbarkeit als Brücke zwischen den Ufern der 
Analytischen und Kontinentalen Philosophie: Hegel, Wittgenstein 
Alexander Romahn 
Leipzig, Deutschland | Alexander.romahn@gmx.de 
Abstract 
Vermittels der Metapher zweier Ufer und einer zwischen ihnen durch eine Brücke zu schlagenden Verbindung wird der Begriff 
der Unhintergehbarkeit bei Wittgenstein und bei Hegel betrachtet. Dabei werden die jeweiligen Ufer durch einen Blick auf die 
unterschiedlichen Ansichten zur Philosophie bei den beiden Philosophen gezeichnet und es wird auf den Begriff des Sprach-
spiels bei Wittgenstein sowie des Absoluten bei Hegel verwiesen, da sie durch den Kerngedanken, man könne aus den jeweili-
gen Konstrukten nicht heraustreten, einen idealen Ansatzpunkt für eine Brücke darstellen. Nachdem die Brücke gebaut worden 
ist, wird ein erster Vorschlag unterbreitet, wie beide "Ufer" einander näher gebracht werden können. 
 
 
1. Die beiden philosophischen Ufer und die 
Brücke 
Wirft man einen Blick auf Hegels Ansicht zur Rolle der Phi-
losophie, seinen Begriff des  Absoluten sowie die Annah-
me, Menschen können mittels des Gebrauches der Ver-
nunft zu diesem voranschreiten, drängt sich schnell das 
Bild eines sich aus philosophischen Thesen aufbauenden 
Gebäudes der Philosophie auf. Demgegenüber steht Witt-
gensteins dynamische handlungsbezogene Philosophie 
und seine Kritik an dem Aufstellen von Thesen innerhalb 
der Philosophie. In einer Metapher gesprochen, welche 
nicht unpassend zum Gedanken der Trennung zwischen 
kontinentaler und analytischer Philosophie ist: Beide philo-
sophische Ansätze liegen an unterschiedlichen Ufern. Die 
Ufer stellen den Umriss des jeweiligen Ansatzes dar und 
sind klar voneinander geschieden. Doch im Begriff Ufer 
liegt gleichsam die Möglichkeit der Verbindung eines Ufers 
mit dem anderen durch eine Brücke. Diese Brücke, welche 
durch den Begriff der Unhintergebarkeit im jeweiligen An-
satz dargestellt wird, möchte ich stark machen: Dafür ist es 
sinnvoll sich auf die jeweilige Vorstellung von dem, was 
Philosophie ist, bzw. um eine erste Differenz darzustellen, 
auf das, was der Philosoph zu leisten hat, zu konzentrie-
ren. Die Differenzen werden hierbei nur in der Umriss-
zeichnung des Ufers angeschnitten, da vielmehr der Bau 
einer Brücke und die Frage, wie von dieser Brücke aus 
fortzufahren ist, im Zentrum der Betrachtungen stehen soll.  
2. Wittgenstein und die Tätigkeit  des Philo-
sophen  
Die von Wittgenstein in den Philosophischen Untersu-
chungen gezeichnete Ansicht zur philosophischen Tätig-
keit gleicht einer Art aktiver Philosophie. Ein Philosoph hat 
keine Thesen aufzustellen, sondern lediglich zu schauen, 
was in unseren Begriffen und unserem Denken liegt. Einen 
ungefähren Eindruck dessen, was darunter zu verstehen 
ist, zeigt sich insbesondere in Wittgensteins Ausdrucks-
weise: "Aber nimm an..."(PU 34) oder "Frage dich, wie 
du..." (PU 174) "Denken wir an das Erlebnis des..." (PU 
172). Diese Art Fragen zu stellen, immer wieder zum Hin-
sehen und Nachdenken darüber aufzufordern, wie es sich 
denn mit unseren Begriffen, mit den Dingen abseits unse-
rer vorschnellen Thesen und Schlüsse wirklich verhält, den 
Blick darauf zu richten, was sich vorstellen oder eben auch 
nicht vorstellen lässt, trägt etwas vom Charakter, der in 
Platons Menon gezeichneten sokratischen Methode des 
sich Wiedererinnerns und des mittels Nachfragen zur Er-
kenntnis verhelfen. (vgl. Platon, 1985 S. 21ff) Wenngleich 
man diese Analogie mit Vorsicht zu betrachten hat, kann 
man ein Pendant zum Wiedererinnern im sokratischen 
Sinne wohl in dem sich auf die eigene Sprache und das 
eigene Denken "Rückbesinnen" finden.  
"Die Arbeit des Philosophen ist ein Zusammentragen 
von Erinnerungen zu einem bestimmten Zweck." (PU 
127)  
Insofern hat es die Philosophie aber auch nicht mit Thesen 
zu tun, denn: "[w]ollte man Thesen in der Philosophie auf-
stellen, es könnte nie über sie zur Diskussion kommen, 
weil Alle mit ihnen einverstanden wären." (PU 128) 
Einen wesentlichen Teil der Untersuchungen Wittgen-
steins macht hierbei das Sprachspiel aus. "Ich werde 
auch das Ganze: der Sprache und der Tätigkeiten, mit 
denen sie verwoben ist, das >>Sprachspiel<< nennen. " 
(Wittgenstein, PU 7)   
Dieses Sprachspiel kann man nur von innen über Analyse 
der verschiedenen Familienähnlichkeiten der unzähligen, 
möglichen Sprachspiele begrenzen, denn aus dem 
Sprachspiel als dem Ganzen kann man nicht hinaustreten. 
Um etwa eine sprachliche Beschreibung des Spiels an-
zugeben, wäre diese doch selbst Teil des Sprachspiels.  
Auf den Punkt gebracht, das Sprachspiel ist unhintergeh-
bar. 
Wendet man die soeben dargestellten Ideen konsequent 
auf vorliegende Ausführungen an, bedeutet dies, dass die-
se in zwei Teile zerfallen: 
Der erste Teil ist die philosophische Beschreibung der 
Rolle der Philosophie, wie sie von Wittgenstein und 
auch von Hegel gegeben wird, aber darum nicht etwa 
"Metaphilosophie" ist (was auch immer das in diesem 
Kontext sein mag). Und der zweite Teil ein Stück Philo-
sophiegeschichte, Biographie oder Übersetzung, inso-
fern, als dass es sich bei den von mir getroffenen Zu-
schreibungen, wenn man es genau nimmt, um Thesen 
der Art: "Wittgenstein hat das und das gesagt" handelt. 
3. Hegel und die Rolle der Philosophie  
Hegels Sicht auf die Aufgabe der Philosophie und ihrem 
Weg zum Wissen stellt sich in etwa wie folgt dar: Geht 
man davon aus, dass seit jeher die Philosophie sich mit 
dem Erkennen der Wahrheit oder des Absoluten beschäf-
tigt und dies stets mittels des Denkens, so ist es klar, dass 
jedes System, welches sich ein Philosophisches nennt, 
gewisse Gemeinsamkeiten mit anderen Systemen dieser 

Unhintergehbarkeit als Brücke zwischen den Ufern der Analytischen und Kontinentalen Philosophie: Hegel, Wittgenstein | Alexander Romahn 
 
 
 234
Art (System meint hier natürlich eine Art philosophischen 
Ansatz eines Autors getrennt von anderen Autoren und 
nicht das Philosophische System bzw. die Philosophie in 
ihrer Entwicklung) haben muss. Wäre es die komplette 
Verkehrung dessen, so würde es mit Recht eine Unphilo-
sophie genannt. Diese Problematik greift Hegel in der Vor-
rede zur Phänomenologie auf, wenn er davon spricht, 
dass  eine historische Angabe über die Tendenz und Be-
hauptungen, über die Wahrheit und Falschheit philosophi-
scher Systeme der philosophischen Wahrheit unangemes-
sen sei, da "[d]ie wahre Gestalt, in welcher die Wahrheit 
existiert [...] allein das wissenschaftliche System derselben 
sein [kann] (Hegel, 1986b S. 14). Hierin liegt auch der 
Grundgedanke, dass philosophisches Wissen wesentlich 
performativ ist und das Absolute Wissen nicht einfach auf-
gefunden werden kann, denn wäre es abhängig von endli-
chen Bestimmungen müsste sich ein infiniter Regress 
entwickeln, der nie vom Boden der endlichen Bestimmun-
gen loskommt. Unmittelbares Wissen ist das wesentlich 
Produkt des vermittelten Wissens bzw. die Entwicklung 
des philosophischen Wissens innerhalb der verschiedenen 
philosophischen Ansätze. Dieses, da es nicht Abgleich mit 
externem Wissen, sondern wesentlich Entwickeltes ist, 
kann nicht umittelbar aufgefunden werden, sondern muss 
sich innerhalb der Philosophie entwickelten. Daher ist der 
Weg, den dieses Wissen über die verschiedenen philoso-
phischen Systeme nimmt, ihr wesentlicher Weg. (vgl. He-
gel, 1986a S. 148ff.) Der Weg, den die Philosophie gehen 
muss, ist also ein Weg innerhalb der Philosophie selbst, da 
sie nicht auf externe Wahrheiten, die von sich aus beste-
hen, zurückgreifen kann.  
Für eine komplette Begriffserklärung dessen, was dabei 
das in der Philosophie hervorgebrachte Absolute ist, kann 
hier nicht der Ort sein, doch werden zwei Bemerkungen 
ausreichen, um zumindest Eines zu zeigen: das Absolute 
ist unhintergehbar. Hegel teilt das Absolute in drei zusam-
mengehörige Teile auf: Logik, Natur und Geist. Der 
Mensch ist Teil der Natur, erhebt sich aber vermittels der 
Reflexion über den Standpunkt der Natur hin zum Geisti-
gen. Doch da sowohl Natur als auch Geist Teile des Abso-
luten sind, ist es nicht möglich aus dieser Dreiteilung aus-
zutreten und einen externen Standpunkt einzunehmen. 
4. Die beiden voneinander geschiedenen 
Ufer und ihre Brücke 
Während Wittgenstein vom Philosophen und dessen Tä-
tigkeit spricht, steht für Hegel die Philosophie (das philo-
sophische Gebäude) und die Begriffe im Vordergrund. 
Wittgenstein verneint das Aufstellen von Thesen. Hegel 
verweist darauf, dass es sich bei Sätzen der Philosophie 
um Sätze handeln muss, die nicht einfach durch das An-
nehmen ihres Gegenteils in Zweifel gezogen werden kön-
nen. Dies macht sich in der Unterscheidung zwischen bloß 
verständigen und vernüftigen Sätzen deutlich: Jeder endli-
che Satz des Verstandes hat einen diesem widerspre-
chenden negativen Satz, demgegenüber gibt es zu diesen 
bloß verständigen Sätze die vernünftigen Sätze in denen 
die Widersprüche der sich widerstreitenden verständigen 
Sätze aufgehoben sind. Insofern, als dass die Widersprü-
che selbst schon im Satz aufgelöst sind, handelt es sich 
idealerweise um Sätze, über die jeder übereinstimmt, da 
ihr Gegenteil nicht mehr angenommen werden kann – 
nicht denkbar ist. Und doch ist Hegels Art zu philosophie-
ren eher an Thesen gebunden.  
Das Bild, was sich aus dieser Umrißzeichnung der bei-
den philosophischen Ufer ergibt, lässt sich stark verein-
facht (!) in eine Zweiteilung aus dynamischen tätigkeitsbe-
zogenem und statischen begriffsbezogenen Philosophie-
ren gliedern.   
An dieser Stelle möchte ich jedoch kurz an Hegels 
Sichtweise zur Philosophie und seiner Ansicht, jeder philo-
sophische Ansatz teile Gemeinsamkeiten mit anderen sei-
ner Art, oder es wäre eben keiner, erinnern. Dass es ein 
gemeinsames Grundprinzip neben den Differenzen gibt, 
legen die gezeichneten Umrisse nahe. 
Wo Wittgenstein von dem Sprachspiel als dem unhinter-
gehbaren Ganzen spricht, dessen Grenzen von innen her 
über die unzähligen Sprachspiele auszuloten sind, ist es 
für Hegel das Absolute und dessen  Entwicklung innerhalb 
der Philosophie aufgefasst als Philosophiegeschichte oder 
Zusammenspiel der jeweiligen philosophischen Systeme, 
die nie ganz ausgeblendet werden können. Insofern ist der 
Weg etwas bedeutendes Unverzichtbares. Es ist der ge-
meinsame Vollzug der Philosophie, der Wissen generiert. 
Die Philosophie stellt keine Thesen auf und versucht diese 
dann mit etwaigen externen Fakten abzugleichen. Ich 
kann nicht von Außen auf das Absolute schauen und un-
mittelbare Wahrheiten finden, wie etwa durch Kontemplati-
on. Eine derartige Ansicht wird von Hegel bereits in der 
Enzyklopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften I zu-
rückgewiesen, indem er daraufhinweist, dass ein bloßes 
"Meinen" oder eine nicht sprachlich fassbare "Wahrheit" im 
Sinne eines umittelbaren Wissens nie mehr sein kann, als 
subjektives Gefühl des Individuums. Dergleichen sprach-
lich fassen, es objektivieren, heißt jedoch schon, es vermit-
teln und in ein System gemeinsamen Wissens einzuglie-
dern. "Ein Inhalt hat allein als Moment des Ganzen seine 
Rechtfertigung, außer demselben aber eine unbegründete 
Voraussetzung oder subjektive Gewißheit" (Hegel, 1986a 
S. 60)  
5. Ausblick  
Natürlich ist diese Darstellung zweier derart komplexer 
philosophischer Strategien sehr  stark verkürzt und mehr 
als ein erster Brückenschlag über die jeweilige Art der Un-
hintergehbarkeit – zum einen des Sprachspiels, zum ande-
ren des Absoluten – kann an dieser Stelle nicht geleistet 
werden. Zwar stellen beide philosophischen Ansätze un-
terschiedliche Ufer dar, weisen auf den ersten Blick große 
Differenzen auf, doch bedeutet, um bei der Metahper zu 
bleiben, eine Brücke auch immer eine Möglichkeit von ei-
nem Ufer zum Anderen zu gelangen und umgekehrt. 
Eine Möglichkeit des Fortschreitens sehe ich zum Bei-
spiel darin, von der Unhintergehbarkeit aus vermittels 
Wittgensteins Begriff der Familienähnlichkeit eine Analyse 
Hegels vorzunehmen, Hegel sozusagen nach Art Wittgen-
steins zu interpretieren. Eine andere Möglichkeit, ist es 
natürlich jenen Versuch umzudrehen und Wittgenstein 
konkreter mehr im Hinblick auf greifbare Thesen nach Art 
Hegels zu lesen.  
Dabei sollte es mehr als nur geschichtliche oder biogra-
phische Bereicherung sein, einen Vergleich beider Ansät-
ze durchzuführen. Eine weitere Forschung in dieser Rich-
tung mag gerade auf die philosophieinterne Frage: "Was 
ist Philosophie" einiges Licht werfen  und mit philosophi-
schen Verwirrungen, auch im Hinblick auf Geltung und 
Methoden der Philosophie aufräumen und so eventuell 
auch den anderen Wissenschaften Grenzen in der Geltung 
ihrer Aussagen aufzuweisen, nicht wenn sie ihre For-
schung betreiben, denn darauf sollte wie Wittgenstein 
festhält die Philosophie keinen Einfluss haben, aber wenn 
sich in anderen Wissenschaften, von den Ergebnissen ver-
leitet, unbemerkt "philosophische" Thesen einschleichen,

Linguistic Origin of Policy and Policy Failure 
Yungho Sakong 
Pyeongtaek, Republic of Korea | sakongyh@ptu.ac.kr 
Abstract 
Combined with constructive human intentionality, language creates a gap between the state of affairs in itself and the described 
situations by language. At linguistic level based on ‘natural attitude’, something problematic seems to be surely happening to 
justify government interventions. At ontological level(actual life and social action level), however, it is not easy to isolate the 
state of affairs as an independent phenomenon. Furthermore, this gap is disguised by misplaced concreteness and self-
referential meaning formation of words. This gap opens an opportunity for politics and government intervention. Policy and its 
failure take places because actual state of affairs is completely different from the verbally constructed situations. 
 
 
1. Policy failures in Korea 
We have been challenged by so many policy problems In 
Korea; compacted but increasing population of Seoul capi-
tal area, unclear business governance system, labor man-
agement conflict, dramatically increased part-time jobs, 
private schooling, explosively increasing social security 
and medical insurance cost, etc. Even though so many 
policy measures have been devised to address these 
states of affairs, some problems have been lasting since 
1970s and 1980sgetting for 30 or 40 years . Policy re-
searchers seem to expect that these problems can be 
solved if policy alternatives can be formed properly. 
However, these problems involve unique phenomenol-
ogical and linguistic problems. People are not usually 
aware of how their hidden consciousness works and how 
their language works. People are not usually aware of the 
ontology of the social world and its relation with language. 
Considering epistemological and linguistic problems, pol-
icy problem could be an elaborative illusion created by 
human thought and language. The fallacy of misplaced 
concreteness can prevail in the whole process of policy. 
Even though the problems are deeply artificial, abstractive, 
and subjective at ontological level, they can be perceived 
quite real at the level of linguistic expression. As they 
seem to be real, politicians acquire an opportunity to inter-
vene without comprehensive research and inclusive dis-
cussions. Linguistic problem also make it difficult to protect 
policy decision from the influences of prejudice, one-sided 
interest. Furthermore, even though the policy failed to ad-
dress the problems, government intervention continues 
because the states of affairs will continue to be regarded 
as a problem.  
2. Epistemological problems of policy prob-
lem understanding of social science 
1. Understanding as an intentional construction and 
interpretation 
In social area, what we take to be ‘something’ or ‘some 
problem’ depends on how we interpret, and how we inten-
tionally understand the state of affairs. If we do not agree 
with something, this difference is rooted in the way that we 
construct the world. "Policy problems" don't exist in the 
social world as independent objects. Rather, we construct 
worlds of good and bad, and define anything standing in 
the way of achieving what we value as "a problem".  
If our observations are not organized by background 
theories and concepts, experience, language, and, in gen-
eral, our entire past, it doesn’t mean something(Heidegger, 
1962; Gadamer, 2012).  If the aiming value or forms of life 
could were changed, all that we construct as "problems" 
could be reconstructed as "opportunities". The way in 
which we understand the world is not required by "what 
there is"(Gergen, 2009: 5). For any state of affairs, a po-
tentially unlimited number of interpretations could be pos-
sible depending on how we understand them. Interpreta-
tions of the world are achieved through intentional con-
struction by human consciousness.  
Policy problems are also the outcomes of intentional in-
terpretative construction. For example, the concept of hu-
man equality can’t be generated only by observing the so-
cial situation. Even though a society has an extremely un-
equal caste system, the situation itself says nothing about 
human equality. If all members are taking the status sys-
tem for granted, this system can be a desirable at least for 
them and recognized as an equal system, because each 
member is treated in accordance with his or her social 
status. The meaning of a certain situation is formed on the 
ground of previous experiences, theory, ideology, value, 
etc. Therefore, diverse interpretations are destined to be 
born on the same situation depending on different back-
grounds.  
Interpretation is a documentarian selective recognizing 
process (Garfinkel, 1967; Heritage, 1984). Imagine a direc-
tor of documentary film who plans to make a film to inform 
people of some special knowledge. To achieve the goal, 
the director has to choose some selected materials and 
exclude all others. The message of this film changes de-
pending on how individual documentary evidences are se-
lected. Social science researches resemble documentary 
film. Social researchers have to incessantly select some 
aspects to understand the meaning of the state of affairs. 
In other words, it is a procedure of exclusion and rejection 
of competitive interpretations. Goodman(1984: 36) claims 
as follow; “Now as we thus make constellations by picking 
out and putting together certain stars rather than others, so 
we make stars by drawing certain sorts of boundary rather 
than others.” Nothing dictates whether the sky shall be 
marked off into constellations or other objects. Interpreta-
tive gerrymandering can be in some degree inevitable.  
 
2. The problem of ‘natural attitude’  
Human consciousness plays a pivotal role to intentionally 
construct a policy problem. However, people usually have 
little ideas about how their consciousness works, because 
considerable portion of the work of consciousness is hid-
den. Therefore, they are ignorant about the fact that their 

Linguistic Origin of Policy and Policy Failure | Yungho Sakong 
 
 
 
237
inconspicuous sediment knowledge affects unwittingly to 
their understanding of social situations. Policy makers and 
researchers who are approaching the problem with ‘natural 
attitude(Husserl)’ are also ignorant that the problems they 
think they defined objectively are actually the outcome of 
transcendental construction of their hidden consciousness. 
Under ‘natural attitude’, researchers are likely to mistake 
‘subjective constructs’ to ‘objective descriptions’, ‘preju-
diced partial interpretation’ to ‘objective whole understand-
ing’ of the situations. ‘Artificially constructed abstracts’ may 
also be taken to be ‘real concrete being’. Even though tak-
ing positive survey methods, it is not easy to prevent the 
problem of natural attitude. According to Husserl and Hei-
degger, prejudice constraints our understanding at the 
stage of transcendental thinking. Therefore, the concepts 
that are forming theoretical factors for positive survey can 
also be exposed to a one-sided thought and values. Thus, 
our comprehension of science can never rely on full "ob-
jectivity". All objective conclusions are said to be ultimately 
founded upon subjective conditioning and worldview.  
3. Linguistic characteristics of social world 
1. Absence of referents 
Unique interactions between mind and language involve 
dual risks that on the one hand, it can have people fall into 
a biased view, and on the other hand, it can blind people 
to aware their own prejudices. The terminologies used for 
human action and social state of affairs are easily exposed 
to prejudice. Terms about social phenomena acquire their 
meaning completely different way from that of natural sci-
ence. First of all, they don’t acquire their meaning by indi-
cating certain physical objects or social states. Owing to 
Frege’s expression, and strictly to say, they have no refer-
ent objects. Social words have their meaning not by refer-
ent but by the capacity of human mind that constitute the 
objects of human consciousness. The ability of intentional 
constitution of consciousness allows to construct the 
meaning indexically (Garfinkel, 1967).  
Furthermore, isolating certain social phenomena from its 
social context and circumstances distorts the phenomenon 
itself. distorts Human being, social world, and social reali-
ties(language, law, government, institutions etc.) are onto-
logically entangled because they make up jointly each 
other(Piaget, Foucault, Heidegger, Putnam). It is almost 
impossible to isolate certain phenomenon without distor-
tion from the surrounding world (Wittgenstein, Heidegger, 
from Braver, 2012). It is also difficult to define a certain 
situation as the policy problem. In some instances, holistic 
change of the social world is required to solve a social 
problem.  
Despite of lacking referent and inseparably entangled re-
lation among social phenomena, social researchers are 
forced to state about “something”. They coin differentiated 
names and conduct researches using them. Under these 
circumstances, a dilemma of social science takes place. In 
linguistic aspects, some independent objects seem to exist 
out there. Viewed in ontological perspective, however, 
there is nothing that can be out there as an independent 
reality. 
 
2. Self-referential meaning formation  
The meaning of a word of social objects and social phe-
nomena are usually formed by self-referential manner. The 
phenomenon and the meaning of that phenomenon bring 
into existence simultaneously by human thought. For ex-
ample, in order to explain the concept “equality”, we must 
mention what people think about. If everybody stops think-
ing about that state of affairs is unequal, the state of equal-
ity will that state of affairs ceases to exist. In this sense, 
the concept of equality is self-referential. How we think of 
equality is the genetic ground of the meaning. For social 
phenomenon, the attitude or the thought that we take to-
ward is, partly or sometimes decisively, constitutive of the 
phenomenon and its meaning(Searle, 1995: 32). We do 
not condemn certain acts because they are immoral; they 
are immoral because we condemn them(Kripke, 1982: 93). 
In social world, meaning is man-made.  
Like social languages, social realities(law, firms, gov-
ernment, position, etc.) can also be brought into existence 
by self-referential status imposition (Searle, 1995, 2010, 
Anscombe, 1978; Garfinkel, 1967). In this sense, ontology 
and epistemology are intermingled in social phenomena. 
Collective intentionality is the essential factor that enables 
social institution to exist and operate. It is human intention 
that determines what kind of instrument a policy will be-
come. Depending of the intention of policy maker, policy 
can be an instrument for a dictatorship, and at the same 
time, for social goodness. The thought and language of 
people are the ontological and operational foundation for 
policy.  
4. Steps to policy and policy failures in Ko-
rea 
1. Emerging implicit thinking and feeling  
Implicit thinking or feeling emerges from everyday life and 
background knowledge. At first, these feelings are ex-
pressed with existing words. But existing words can’t fully 
present the novel meanings because they are already col-
ored with past uses. To express novel meaning, new vo-
cabulary is required. 
 
2. The birth of new words 
New vocabulary emerges to express new meaning. Some 
examples are as follows in Korea; (1) ‘Su-do-guon’; means 
the Seoul capital area. This word is usually contrasted with 
‘Ji-bang’ which names distant locations from Seoul. (2) 
‘Sa-gyo-youk’; means private schooling. This word is usu-
ally contrasted with ‘Gong-gyo-youk’ which means all regu-
lar school educations. (3) ‘Bie-jung gyu-jik’; means part 
time job. This word is usually contrasted with ‘Jung-gyu-jik’ 
which means full-time job. (4) ‘Jae-bul’; means large en-
terprises like Samsung Electronics. This word is usually 
contrasted with ‘Jung so gi yup’ which means medium and 
small sized companies. So many policies implemented to 
treat these problems.  
When evaluated in terms of epistemological and linguis-
tic grounds, these words have serious defects. New words 
have their meaning not from something objective referents 
but from interpretative and one-sided meaning formation. 
One-sided meaning will disturb fair description of the state 
of affairs. When analyzed from different angles, or from 
more balanced perspectives, these situations can stop to 
become a problem. These words may also lose their life as 
a word.  
Ironically, epistemological and linguistic shortcomings 
play a very important role for these words to have a stable 
life. First of all, even though the meaning is unfairly biased, 
it will be surely welcome by some people who share the 
thought and interests. Second, these words are colored

emotionally. Colored words are useful to express not only 
certain dissatisfactions but also  aversive feelings of some 
related people. Third, these words not only describe some 
aspects of the states of affairs but also perform an active 
action that makes sarcastic remarks. One-sided meaning 
have advantages to guarantee sympathy from those who 
are located in similar situations.  
 
3. The beginning of new policies 
A policy begins because one-sided words are useful for 
political purposes. One-sided campaign promise has two 
sides. Some people will turn their back because the prom-
ise is against their interests or values. However, some will 
vote for the candidate for this promise. Election candidates 
may well take into account of both sides of campaign 
promises. However, when reliable support from special 
group of voters is required to win, the candidate is willing 
to promise one-sided promise. In addition, competing can-
didate can also propose similar one-sided promises not to 
lose his or her votes.  
In Korea, former president No Mu-Hyun was elected by 
virtue of the campaign promise that he is going to relocate 
capital city to another area. After elected, he made a spe-
cial law for relocation.  This project was suspended, how-
ever, because the Constitutional Court declared the spe-
cial law breached the Constitution. Even though President 
No failed to relocate capital city, he moved government 
departments and scattered government-owned companies 
to local cities. 
 
4. Linguistic origin of policy and policy failure 
What is the role of language that allows a policy to be 
formed and come to have a sustainable life? Combined 
with documentarian interpretative human intentionality, 
language makes us fall into a unique misunderstanding. 
Language plays a dual role; first, language causes a gap 
between the state of affairs in itself and the depicted state 
of affairs by word. Second, this gap is disguised by lan-
guage and the way of human cognition. Consequently, 
really mysterious situations take place. At linguistic level of 
daily ‘natural attitude’, something problematic is surely 
happening to the degree to justify government interven-
tions. At ontological level(actual life and social action 
level), however, it is not easy to isolate the state of affairs 
as an independent part. This gap is covered with the error 
of misplaced concreteness and self-referential meaning 
formation. This gap cause the hopeless policy circle and 
policy failures. These problems may not be solved be-
cause their ontological features. Instead, they may be dis-
solved.  
For examples, so many news and research reports have 
been produced about ‘Seoul capital area’ at the level of 
daily language game. At this linguistic level, it seems that 
there is a concrete specific fact of area. But observed in 
everyday life, it is actually meaningless to distinguish 
‘Seoul capital area’ from other area. It takes only 2 hours 
by express train from Seoul to Busan(located southern end 
of Korean peninsula). So many policies have been made 
to promote balanced development of whole land of the 
country.

Das Innere-Episoden-Problem (Psychologische Ausdrücke)

Abstract 
Die Konzeption von inneren Episoden, wie zum Beispiel dem Schmerz, stellt ein Problem für Wittgenstein in seinem Werk Phi-
losophische Untersuchungen dar, weil die Episoden eine Möglichkeit für die Konzeption einer Privatsprache eröffnen und den 
Solipsismus ermöglichen. Beziehungsweise sie hängen mit der Konzeption eines Subjekts, das einen privilegierten Zugang zu 
sich selbst hat und deswegen die bessere und sogar die alleinige Kenntnis dieser Episoden für sich beansprucht, zusammen. 
Daher wird auch von “Innen” und von “Aussen” gesprochen. “Innen” wäre das, was sich innerhalb des privilegierten epistemi-
schen Bereichs des Subjekts abspielt und “Aussen” wäre das, was auch für andere Subjekte epistemisch gleichermaßen zu-
gänglich sein könnte. In meinem Paper werde ich auf das Problem der inneren Episoden näher eingehen anhand der detaillier-
ten Untersuchung des § 293 der Philosophischen Untersuchungen und der Interpretation von Hacker im Buch Philosophical 
Foundations of Neuroscience. 
 
 
Wittgenstein argumentiert im PU § 293 (a), dass man sa-
gen könne, man wisse nur über den eigenen Fall, was das 
Wort „Schmerz“ bedeutet. Darauf folgt aber die Frage: „- 
Muss das nicht auch für die Anderen gelten?“, d. h. wenn 
ich behaupte zu wissen, was das Wort „Schmerz“ in mei-
nem Fall bedeutet, können die Anderen doch auch nur 
über ihren eigenen Fall wissen, was für sie das Wort 
„Schmerz“ bedeutet. Diese Behauptung, dass ich weiß, 
was „Schmerz“ bedeutet nur von eigenen Fall, impliziert 
eine Bedeutungskonzeption von Gegenstand und Be-
zeichnung, die auf eine Konzeption zurück zu führen ist, in 
dem näm-lich das Wort „Schmerz“ einen Gegenstand be-
nennt. Der Argument hier ist nicht, dass nur er Schmerz 
hat, sondern, dass nur er kennt, was für ihn „Schmerz“ 
bedeutet. Die Folge dieser Argumentation ist: Wenn das 
Wort „Schmerz“ die gleiche Bedeutung für alle Sprach-
spiel-Teilnehmer ha-ben soll, kann es diese nicht durch die 
Verallgemeinerung des eigenen Falles erlangen. Dies wird 
im Paragraph 293 (b) deutlich. Die Verallgemeinerung ei-
gener Fälle ist nicht möglich, weil kein öffentliches Kriterien 
vorliegt, um festzustellen, welche Bedeutung einem Wort 
zukommen soll. Die strategische Argumentation von Witt-
genstein in dem Beispiel des Käfers ist die Unmöglichkeit 
der Verall-gemeinerung von eigenen Fällen, oder die Ve-
rallgemein-erung von Privatsprachen, so dass sie eine all-
gemeine (öffentliche) Sprache bilden, als absurd darzule-
gen. Ein wichtiger Teil des Paragraphen 293 ist: „- Aber 
wenn nun das Wort 'Käfer' dieser Leute doch einen 
Gebrauch hätte? – so wäre es nicht die Bezeichnung ei-
nes Dings. Das Ding in der Schachtel gehört überhaupt 
nicht zum Sprachspiel; auch nicht einmal als ein Etwas: 
denn die Schachtel kön-nte auch leer sein. – Nein, dieses 
Ding in der Schachtel kann 'gekürzt' werden; es hebt sich 
weg, was immer es ist.“ Dieser Abschnitt deutet an, dass 
die öffentliche (äußere) Verwendung eines Worts ent-
scheidend bei der Bedeutungsbestimmung eines Worts ist, 
und daher braucht es keinen allein introspektiv zugänglich 
inneren Vorgang oder Gegenstand zu geben, damit ein 
Emp-findungs-Wort eine Bedeutung erhält. 
Angenommen, dass jene Schachtel das Gehirn einer 
Person ist. Und man nennt, was auch immer in jeder 
Schachteln drin ist oder in jedem Gehirn vorgeht, „Käfer“. 
Nach Wittgenstein ist es in erster Linie nicht entscheidend, 
was in jeder Schachtel drin ist, sondern wie das Wort „Kä-
fer“ verwendet wird, mit welchen Regeln es verwendet 
wird. In diesem Sinn ist für die Bedeutung eines Wortes 
sein öffentlicher Gebrauch vorrangig wichtig. Das heißt, 
dass man auf den Sprachgebrauch oder das Verhalten der 
Person, der Schmerz zugeschrieben wird, achten muss, 
um daraus Kriterien für die Verwendung eines Wortes zu 
erfassen. 
Ein Wort kann auch eine Bedeutung haben, ohne dass 
es sich auf etwas bezieht. Ein Beispiel dafür ist das Bei-
spiel des „Käfers“ in § PU 293. Nach dem Paragraphen PU 
293 wäre dies möglich: Indem ein Wort eine Verwendung 
in einer Gemeinschaft hat, braucht es sich nicht unbedingt 
auf einen Gegenstand zu beziehen, weil seine Bedeutung 
nicht davon abhängt, ob es sich auf etwas bezieht oder 
nicht, sondern auf welche Weise es verwendet wird. 
Wittgenstein kritisiert im ersten Teil des Paragraphen 
293 die epistemische Privatheit, und im zweiten Teil führt 
er das Argument der Privatheit der Bedeutung eines Wor-
tes ad absurdum mit dem Beispiel des „Käfers“. Wenn 
man den ersten Teil des § 293 interpretiert: „Wenn ich von 
mir selbst sage, ich wisse nur vom eigenen Fall, was das 
Wort „Schmerz“ bedeutet, - muß ich das nicht auch von 
den Andern sagen? Und wie kann ich denn den einen Fall 
im so unverantwortlicher Weise verallgemeinern?“, sieht 
man eine Kritik an einer bestimmten Konzeption von Be-
deutung, nämlich einer Konzeption von Bedeutung, nach 
der ein Wort eine Bedeutung hat durch das Benennen als 
eines geistigen Vorgang eines Subjekts. Dazu gehört auch 
die Aussage: Nur ich habe Zugang zu meinen inneren 
Vorgängen, deswegen kenne nur ich, was in meinem Inne-
ren vorgeht. Dass nur ich kenne, was ein Wort für mich 
bedeutet, nennt man semantische Privatheit (Kober 2003, 
S. 71). 
Hacker versucht in seinem Text „Philosophical Foundati-
ons of Neuroscience“, Missverständnisse über Privatheit, 
Inneres, Subjektivität zu erklären, und dies wird auch uns 
helfen, Wittgensteins § PU 293 ins Licht zu bringen. Nach 
Hacker ist die Konzeption von Innerem (the mental) im 
Gegensatz zur Konzeption von Äußerem (the outer – e.g. 
behavior) gebildet. Dieser Konzeption zufolge gehören die 
inneren Vorgänge (mental processes) zu einem speziellen 
Bereich, den man „Privatsphäre“ nennen könnte. Diese 
Sphäre sei nur für das Subjekt, den einzelnen Menschen 
selbst, zugänglich. Nur er wisse, was er denke, nur er füh-
le seine Schmerzen. Die anderen Personen könnten nur 
durch sein Verhalten und seine Ausdrücke auf eine indi-
rekte Weise feststellen, was er denke oder fühle. In die-
sem Sinn habe das Subjekt eine epistemische Privatheit. 
Nach dieser Konzeption sei die Fähigkeit, die diesen direk-
ten Zugang zu meinen eigenen inneren Prozessen ermög-
liche, die Introspektion. Mit der Introspektion sei es mög-
lich, Kenntnis von meinen inneren Prozessen zu haben, 

Das Innere-Episoden-Problem (Psychologische Ausdrücke) | Fernando Scherer 
 
 
 240
ohne zu beobachten, was ich sage oder wie ich mich ver-
halte. 
Hacker kritisiert die These von der Introspektion als einer 
Fähigkeit, sich selbst in die inneren Vorgänge zu „schau-
en“. Diese angebliche Fähigkeit ermögliche, dass ich ei-
nen priviligierten Zugang zu meinen inneren Vorgängen 
habe. Eine Analogie bestehe zwischen unserer Fähigkeit, 
zu sagen, was wir wahrnehmen, einerseits und unseren 
Wahrnehmungsfähigkeiten andererseits. Die Wahrneh-
mungsfähigkeiten sei von Wahrnehmungsorganen abhän-
gig. Aber die Introspektion sei nicht abhängig von Wahr-
nehmungsorganen wie Ohren, Augen, usw. Die Introspek-
tion sei keine Beobachtung oder eine Art Tätigkeit von 
„mentalen Augen“ (mind`s eyes). Der Ausdruck „mentale 
Augen“ sei auch nur eine Metapher, die man öfters in Hin-
blick auf Introspektion verwendet. Die Introspektion sei 
eine Form von reflexivem Denken und nicht eine Form von 
Wahrnehmung (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 91). 
Nach Hacker sind wir geneigt, „Schmerz“ als etwas Inne-
res zu assoziieren und das Verhalten als etwas Äußeres. 
Es sei wahr, dass man für Erfahrungen ein Subjekt der 
Erfahrungen braucht, aber darüber hinaus folge nicht, 
dass verschiedene Subjekte nicht dieselbe Empfindung, 
Erfahrung, oder denselben Glauben haben können. 
Introspektion sei nicht eine „quasi-perceptual ability“ 
(wahrnehmungsartige Fähigkeit), und sie sei nicht die Fä-
higkeit, eine Erkenntnis über das Innere zu erlangen. Das 
Subjekt habe keinen direkten oder indirekten Zugang zu 
den inneren Prozessen: Es habe Schmerzen, oder es ha-
be keine Schmerzen. Psychologische Wörter sind nicht 
Namen von inneren Prozessen, wie im Fall von Wörtern, 
die sich auf äußere physische Gegenstände beziehen. Die 
Bedeutung dieser Wörter, die sich auf innere Prozesse zu 
beziehen scheinen, können in ihrer Bedeutung nicht im 
Bezug zu inneren Prozessen erklärt werden, denn sie er-
halten ihre Bedeutung durch seinen Verwendungen in eine 
sprachliche Gemeinschaft (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 
88). 
Manchmal taucht auch eine Verwechslung von „Inne-
rem“ und „Mentalem“ auf. Angenommen, jemand hat z.B. 
Zahnschmerzen. Wir sind dann geneigt zu sagen, dass die 
Zahnschmerzen etwas Inneres sind, und man würde dann 
„Inneres“ mit „mental“ verbinden, so dass Zahnschmerz 
etwas Mentales wäre, ein Phänomen, das sich im Geist 
abspielt. Aber nach Hacker wären mentale „Zahnschmer-
zen“ sinnlos, weil die Ursachen der Zahnschmerzen in ei-
nem Zahn und nicht im Geist sind. Wenn ein Zahnarzt den 
Patienten untersucht, wird er feststellen, dass der Zahn 
infiziert ist, oder er findet eine andere Ursache des 
Schmerzes im Zahn. Andere würden sagen, dass man 
ohne die Nerven, die den Impuls zum Gehirn schicken, 
keinen Schmerz fühlen würde, und all dies impliziert nicht, 
dass der Zahnschmerz etwas Mentales ist (Bennett and 
Hacker 2003, p. 88). 
Wenn eine Person etwas denkt oder fühlt und es für sich 
behält, sagt man, dass das Mentale „das Innere“ sei. In 
dem Fall, dass eine Person ihre Gefühle und ihre Gedan-
ken ausdrückt, verwendet man die Metapher „das Äußere“ 
(the „outer“). Aber was zum Ausdruck gebracht wurde, ist 
das „Innere“ (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 89). In diesem 
Sinn würde man sagen: Wenn jemand uns sagt, was er 
sieht, können wir auch sehen, was er sieht, als ob wir in 
sein „Inneres“ schauen könnten. Aber das „Innere“ ist nicht 
hinter dem „Äußeren“ („outer“). Diese Betrachtungen sol-
len klarstellen, dass „Inneres“ und „Äußeres“ („outer“) Me-
taphern sind, die auf verschiedene Weisen verwendet 
werden, und wenn man sich nicht klar darüber ist, auf wel-
che Art man diese Metaphern verwendet, unterliegt man 
leicht einem Missverständnis und verwendet „Inneres“ und 
„Äußeres“ als Entitäten. 
Nach Hacker kritisiert Wittgenstein das Bild vom Inneren 
im Gegensatz zum Äußeren. Das Innere sei nicht hinter 
dem Äußeren, so wie man es sich vorstellen könnte, etwa 
im Gehirn. Das Innere und das Äußere seien Bilder unse-
rer Sprache (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 89). 
Das Missverständnis über die Konzeption von Privatheit 
beruhe auf Missverständnissen über den direkten und indi-
rekten Zugang zu den eigenen inneren Vorgängen. Aus 
der Konzeption, dass nur ich Zugang zu meinen inneren 
Vorgängen habe, folge die Konzeption von Privatheit. 
Nach Hacker ist es ohne Zweifel richtig, dass jeder 
Schmerz ein Schmerz von jemandem ist. So scheinen 
Schmerzen eine Art von privaten Entitäten zu sein, denn 
eine andere Person kann nicht dieselben Schmerzen wie 
ich haben, nur ähnliche (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 94). 
Ich hätte demnach eine einzigartige Beziehung zu meinen 
Schmerzen. Wenn man diesem Gedankengang folgt, dann 
kann man auch sagen, dass ein anderer nicht meine Ge-
danken oder meine Überzeugung haben kann. 
Nach Hacker liegt ein Missverständnis in dieser Argu-
mentation. Das Missverständnis sei, dass eine Person 
durch Possessivpronomen z.B. Schmerzen als meine 
Schmerzen identifiziert und nicht auf die Eigenschaften 
des Schmerzen achtet. Nach Hacker: „The criteria of iden-
tity of a pain consist in its intensity, location and phenome-
nological features, and if your pain and mine tally in these 
respects, then we both have the same pain, just as if the 
colour of this cushion tallies with the colour of that cushion 
in hue, value and chroma, then the two cushions have the 
same colour…”(Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 96). In dieser 
Perspektive einen Schmerz zu haben heißt nicht, einen 
einzigartigen Zugang zu etwas zu haben, oder einen spe-
ziellen Zugang, eine spezielle Beziehung zu meinem 
Schmerz zu haben (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 96). 
Die Bedeutung der Wörter von psychologischen Prädika-
ten sind nicht durch einen speziellen Zugang zum „Inne-
ren“ gegeben. Diese Theorie, dass das Wort „Schmerzen“ 
z.B. sich auf verschiedene Schmerzempfindungen bezieht, 
zu welchen nur ich Zugang habe, ist ein Missverständnis. 
Nach dieser Art von Theorie wären die Wörter Namen von 
privaten Erfahrungen (Bennett and Hacker 2003, p. 97). 
Hacker kritisiert in seinem Text die Zuschreibung von 
psychologischen Prädikaten an Teilen des menschlichen 
Körpers und nicht an einem Menschen als Ganzem. Zum 
Beispiel die Behauptung, das Gehirn würde denken, glau-
ben, usw. Diese Art von Zuschreibung nennt Hacker „me-
reologischer Fehlschluss“. Dieser „Fehlschluss“ beruhe auf 
einem cartesianischen Dualismus, in dem man psycholo-
gische Prädikate als erstes dem Gehirn zuschreibt und 
dann, erst als Folgerung, dem Menschen. Wenn man die 
Kritik an den „mereologischen Fehlschluss“ mit dem § 293 
PU vergleicht, entdeckt man, dass die Kritik an der Zu-
schreibung von psychologischen Prädikaten an Teile des 
Körpers auch im § 293 erfolgt. So kritisiert Wittgenstein 
zum Beispiel, dass man das Wort „Schmerz“ als Name 
eines Gegenstandes verwendet, das sich auf einen Teil 
meines Körpers bezieht. Das Problem liegt darin, dass 
man psychologische Prädikate als Namen von Gegens-
tänden verwendet. 
Das Problem des „mereologischen Fehlschlusses“ ist ein 
philosophisches Problem und nicht ein Problem, das man 
durch wissenschaftliche Beobachtungen lösen kann. Da-
her ist es wichtig darauf zu achten, wie Wörter verwendet 
werden. In PU § 281 bezieht Wittgenstein sich auf das 
Prinzip, dass man psychologische Prädikate nur einem

241
Sein als Ganzen, welches sich ähnlich wie der Mensch 
verhält, zuschreiben kann und nicht einem Teil des Gan-
zem: „Es kommt darauf hinaus: man könne nur vom le-
benden Menschen, und was ihm ähnlich ist, (sich ähnlich 
benimmt) sagen, es habe Empfindungen; es sähe; sei 
blind; höre; sei taub; sei bei Bewusstsein, oder bewusst-
los.“ Dies kann man auch in PU § 286 lesen: „… Wenn 
einer in der Hand Schmerzen hat, so sagt's die Hand nicht 
(außer sie schreibt's), und man spricht nicht der Hand 
Trost zu, sondern dem Leidenden; man sieht ihm in die 
Augen.“ 
Wittgenstein kritisiert die Konzeption einer Privatsprache 
im § 293, dafür stellt er die Frage an seine Gegner: Wie 
kann ich die Äußerung „meines Schmerzes“ verallgemei-
nern, so dass jeder meine Äußerung versteht? Wenn die 
Sprachtheorie, dass jeder nur vom eigenen Schmerz weiß, 
stimmt – und diese Theorie hat als Voraussetzung die Be-
ziehung zwischen einem Namen und seinem Bezug –, wie 
kann es möglich sein, dass ein anderer mich versteht? 
Wittgenstein stellt dann auch eine Kritik an der Konzep-
tion vom „Inneren“ und „Äußeren“ auf anhand des Bei-
spiels des Käfers. Was in der Schachtel drin ist, gehöre 
auf analoge Weise zum „Inneren“, und was „draußen“ ge-
schieht, sei das „Äußere“. Wenn man das Beispiel des Kä-
fers auf Menschen überträgt, wären das „Innere“ der 
Schachtel die Vorgänge, die in unserem Gehirn gesche-
hen, und das „Äußere“ das Verhalten, die Handlungen 
bzw. die Verwendung von Wörtern. 
Psychologische Ausdrücke können nicht durch eine 
ostensive Definition benannt werden bzw. Bedeutung er-
halten. Wenn dies der Fall wäre, dann könnte keiner die 
Bedeutung des Wortes, die der Andere verwendet, ken-
nen, und als Folge könnte Keiner den Anderen verstehen. 
Im Fall der Empfindungswörter führt das Muster von Be-
zeichnung und Gegenstand in Analogie zu der physischen 
Welt zu Missverständnissen, weil die Empfindungswörter 
sich nicht auf Gegenstände beziehen und man kein öffent-
liches Kriterium dafür hat (PU § 293).

Final Values and Grounding 
Pedro Schmechtig 
Dresden, Germany | Pedro.Schmechtig@gmx.de 
Abstract 
In reference to G. E. Moore (1922), it is often asserted that the distinction between final and instrumental value-attitudes coin-
cides with that of intrinsic or extrinsic values. In contrast to this assertion, I argue for a strong non-reductionistic separation of 
both pairs of conceptions. Under this proposal, Moore’s cointensional explanation of metaphysical grounding of intrinsic values 
must be abandoned. Instead I will make the case for a hyperintensional characterization of those properties on which the values 
are based. Thusly, such properties can be given both in intrinsic and extrinsic ways. Consequently, typical cases of final-
extrinsic esteems must be analyzed as “mixed cases” of the mode of the givenness of a value-grounding property. 
 
 
In the philosophy of value there has traditionally been a 
distinction at the center: A thing can be considered valu-
able for its own sake (final) or for the sake of something 
else (instrumental). With reference to G. E. Moore (1922), 
it is often asserted that this distinction coincides with the 
following: Something can have value in virtue of intrinsic or 
extrinsic constituents – mostly properties are meant 
thereby. On the other hand, Christine Korsgaard (1983) 
criticized that such conceptual conflation is invalid. Many 
other authors agree with her critique. But it is not clear how 
strong her proposed taxonomy is to manage. Supporters 
of a weak non-reductive view are convinced that a correla-
tion at least partially exists. In contrast, I argue for a strong 
non-reductionistic separation of both pairs of conception. 
Under this approach, Moore’s cointensional explanation of 
metaphysical grounding of intrinsic values must also be 
abandoned. 
1 Intrinsic versus final – one or two con-
ceptions of values? 
In her essay “Two Distinctions in Goodness“ Christine 
Korsgaard (1983) argues for distinguishing two basic forms 
of speech from values: 
 
The manner with which we explain that something 
has a value – namely due to intrinsic or extrinsic 
constituents. 
 
 
The manner with which we esteem or consider 
something valuable – namely for its own sake (final) 
or for the sake of something else (instrumental). 
When the first form concerns the “possessing” of a value, 
the second form in reference to the attitudes of esteeming 
are taken. According to this separation, both of the follow-
ing pairs of conceptions must be distinguished: 
 
Intrinsic value: α is intrinsically valuable if and only if 
the source of the value exclusively lies in α itself. 
 
Extrinsic value: α is extrinsically valuable if and only if 
the source of the value does not lie exclusively in α itself. 
 
Final esteems: α is finally valuable if and only if α is es-
teemed as an end.  
 
Instrumental esteems: α is instrumentally valuable if 
and only if αis esteemed as a means. 
According to Korsgaard, both pairs of conceptions do not 
coincide since there are cases of final esteems whose 
source of explanation is extrinsic nature. Typical examples 
are situations in which something is held for valuable 
through (i) rarity (e.g. Blue Mauritius), (ii) historical mean-
ing (e.g. Abraham Lincoln’s penholder) or (iii) emotional 
consternation (e.g. the memory of a loved one).  
Advocates of the traditional way of thinking have disbe-
lieved that this argumentation is conclusive. Before I more 
closely consider whether this skepticism is warranted, a 
problem of the proposed taxonomy must first be ad-
dressed. 
Korsgaard composes instrumental esteems as a natural 
contrast class to final esteems. This conjecture is, how-
ever, problematic. Something can be esteemed for the 
sake of something else without it thereby dealing with an 
efficient means. For example, a wedding ring, among other 
things, is therefore considered valuable because it symbol-
izes the mutual bond of matrimony. The act of symboliza-
tion, however, is not an instrument that the bond of matri-
mony conduces or even produces. Clearly the class of 
non-final esteems is more comprehensive than the class of 
instrumental esteems. But it is unclear how non-final es-
teems which possess no instrumental character fit in Kors-
gaard’s taxonomy.  
At the same time, there is an analogous problem with the 
class of final esteems. Korsgaard represents the following 
intentional principle: 
(FW-I) If a person S esteems a thing α in a final man-
ner, than S has a good reason to produce or to   in-
crease α as end of his action. 
Looked at in this light, all final esteems must fall under 
(FW-I). It has, however, been justifiably criticized that there 
are various types of final esteems which this does not af-
fect. Particularly with the so-called sentimental values (cf. 
Hatzimoysis 2003), the kind of (final) esteem appears to be 
linked with an affective pro-attitude. Such pro-attitudes do 
not depend upon that something is produced as end of an 
action. 
As a result of (FW-I), it is sometimes claimed that the 
bearers of final esteems are solely the state of affairs (cf. 
Zimmerman 2001). However, this claim is misleading. It 
assumes the observation that one cannot produce or in-
crease specific things (like people, animals, objects, etc.). 
But from this, it does not follow that the state of affairs 
which are in accord with (FW-I) are the fundamental bearer 
of values. Rather, it is so that (FW-I) is not a necessary 
principle for final esteems.

2 The orthodox view of intrinsic values 
According to Moore, the discourse of intrinsic values is 
equally significant with the question of how one possesses 
value. Thereby, this is generally valid: Values are 
grounded in the properties of the object which possesses a 
value.1 Consequently, the thing has an intrinsic value 
when it has this value in virtue of the intrinsic nature of this 
property. Nevertheless, what does it mean after all that a 
property is intrinsic nature? Moore’s fundamental idea im-
plies: A property is intrinsic when for two exactly similar 
things with relation to all possible worlds it can be ex-
cluded that a thing instantiates this property and the an-
other thing does not instantiate this property. Based on this 
underlying idea, Moore (1922, 261) developed the follow-
ing duplication strategy: 
For any F, F is an intrinsic property =df. F is a property, 
and (ii) for any x and y, and for any worlds w1 and w2 
such that x at w1 is a duplicate of y at w2, x has F at w1, 
gdw. Y has F at w2. 
According to this proposal, properties, on which intrinsic 
values are based, are to be characterized as cointen-
sional. Properties of this kind have the same extension in 
all possible worlds, meaning they will be instantiated in all 
possible worlds through the same individuals. A property 
F, which for the purpose of the duplication-account is clas-
sified as intrinsic, is essentially distinguished from an ex-
trinsic property G with regard to the conditions under which 
G is instantiated. It is therefore impossible, according to 
this account, that something possesses a value which is 
grounded in a property and that this property is, at the 
same time, both intrinsic and extrinsic (F ˄ G). 
Hereinafter I would like to denote this cointensional 
strategy of the metaphysical grounding of intrinsical values 
as the orthodox Mooreian view. Supporters of this view 
have rejected a strict separation of intrinsic value and final 
esteems in the following way: It is possible that there are 
cases in which a final esteem relies on extrinsic properties. 
But these cases do not contradict the orthodox perspec-
tive. At the very least a stricter correlation partially exists 
(cf. Zimmerman 2001, 62; Rabinowicz and Rønnow-
Rasmussen 1999, 34):  Once the value of a thing is 
grounded in its intrinsic properties, the thereby connected 
value-attitude of final nature must be. An assertion of form 
“α is final valuable if and only if α is intrinsically valuable” is 
certainly too severe. Nevertheless, it can be spoken of a 
strong correlation in a direction of the biconditional 
(namely in the left-right reading): 
 
Weak non-reductive view of final esteems (NR-W) 
 
(NR-W) 
(i) There are final esteems which are not 
based on intrinsic properties.  
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) When α is intrinsically valuable, α cor-
relates with a final esteem.  
In effect Korsgaard’s position appears to be identical with 
(NR-W). In my opinion this is a great disadvantage of their 
position. Contrary to Korsgaard, I argue for a strong non-
reductionist view. Thus, there are not only final esteems 
which are not based solely in intrinsic properties. Rather 
the reverse applies as well: Something can have an intrin-
sic value without a final esteem (in the same regard) ap-
propriately appearing. This position can be expressed as 
follows: 
                                                      
1 Moore does not directly use the term of grounding. He assumes, however, in 
the robust ontological sense, that all values “supervenient” on certain non-
descriptive properties of the bearer of that value. 
Strong non-reductive view of final esteems (NR-S) 
 
(NR-S) (i) There are final esteems which are not based 
on intrinsic properties.  
 
 
(ii) Something can be intrinsically valuable and 
correlate with a non-final esteem. 
According to this view, there is no compelling intrinsic-final 
link. Because according to (NR-S), there exists in neither 
of the two directions a strict coincidence between the pos-
sessing of a value in virtue of intrinsic properties and the 
final esteem of the bearer of these properties. 
3 Hyperintensionality and the metaphysical 
grounding of esteems 
What argues for a strong liberal explanation of final es-
teems? In my opinion the weak non-reductive view (NR-W) 
is connected with an incorrect – namely the orthodox – 
metaphysical grounding of intrinsic value. Counter to 
Moore’s duplication strategy, there are numerous con-
cerns. Here are three standard problems:  
 
 
The term of “duplicate relative to a possible world 
wn“ is unclear. A non-circularly explication of this 
term leads to further difficulties.
2 
 
The duplication approach is compelled to treat non-
qualitative properties like “being Abraham Lincoln”, 
which are evidently intrinsic nature, as extrinsic (cf. 
Eddon 2011). 
 
The duplication approach classifies all necessary 
properties as intrinsic. Accordingly, it is not capable 
of explaining necessary properties which are extrin-
sic nature.
3 
Furthermore, there is an objection that is of rather particu-
lar importance. Supporters of (NR-W) appear to share the 
approach with Moore that a cointensional strategy of the 
explanation of properties in which value is grounded is 
principally correct. Instead, I argue the following:  Final 
extrinsic esteems indicate in a paradigmatic way that the 
orthodox cointensional strategy is inadequate. In conclu-
sion, I would like to shortly explain my assertion.  
In the discussion of value, it is often overlooked that the 
analysis of intrinsic properties allows for two different ap-
proaches (cf. Francescotti 1999, Humberstone 1996). One 
can wonder if a property simpliciter is intrinsic – meaning 
independent of individuals who instantiate this property. Or 
one wonders if some individual possesses a property in an 
intrinsic way. The first question can be labeled as global or 
attributive (Is F an intrinsic property?). Instead, the second 
question is local or adverbial (Does x have an F in an in-
trinsic way?). The following example makes this distinction 
clearly: The disjunctive property “being round or being ac-
companied by something green” is extrinsic (global). Nev-
ertheless, it is a property which has bullets in an intrinsic 
way (local). 
                                                      
2 The assertion suggests that x is a duplicate of y if and only if x and y pos-
sess the same intrinsic properties. Here, the impending circularity of the defini-
tion of intrinsic properties is, according to David Lewis (1983), avoided by 
introducing the term of “perfect natural property”. Various authors (cf. Witmer 
et al 2005, Yablo 1999), however, have criticized that this term is also puz-
zling. 
3 Suppose a property like “being such that there is a number” is a necessary 
property. According to the duplication approach, this property is intrinsic. Be-
cause provided a thing x in w1 has such a property, then also every duplicateyn 
in w1+n must have this property. This contradicts, however, the intuition that 
every thing which itself is not a number has the property “being such that there 
is a number” in extrinsic ways – namely depending on other things of the same 
kind. Cf. Marshall (2013). 

Final Values and Grounding | Pedro Schmechtig 
 
 
 244
As already seen, advocates of the orthodox cointen-
sional strategy assert that a property cannot be intrinsic 
and extrinsic at the same time. Still, this conjecture is justi-
fied, if at all, only with regard to the global issue. In local 
terms nothing speaks against saying that a thing possess 
a property F in intrinsic as well as in extrinsic ways. The 
phenomenon of final-extrinsic esteem clarifies this aspect. 
Final-extrinsic esteems represent a sort of “mixed cases”, 
in which a thing, as a result of two different sources of val-
ues, is held for valuable. In “mixed cases” a thing x pos-
sesses a property F – considering that it is suitable to es-
teem x – in intrinsic as well as in extrinsic ways. This 
shows why the orthodox cointensional strategy is inade-
quate. In the framework of this strategy it is presumed, in 
the sense of the global issue, that all properties in which 
value is grounded are cointensional nature. Thus, the 
sameness of extension of the property also implies the 
sameness of the property. Hence, with regard to one and 
the same property F, it is impossible to distinguish different 
kinds of modes of the givenness, how a thing x possesses 
such a property F.  
By contrast, a strong non-reductive approach of final es-
teems (NR-S) assumes that those properties in which 
value attitudes are grounded are analyzable in the sense 
of the local issues as hyperintensional. According to this, a 
property must be differentiated between various modes of 
givenness as follows (cf. Bader forthcoming): Esteems 
base generally on disjunctive properties of the form (F v (F 
˄ G). A thing x can possess such a disjunctive property P 
in an intrinsic way. This is precisely then the case when x 
inheres the property F and the esteem is appropriate with 
respect to x solely in virtue of F – meaning independently 
from the second disjunct of P (that is F ˄ G). On the other 
hand, a thing x can have the disjunctive property P even in 
extrinsic ways. This is then always the case when the es-
teem with respect to x is not appropriate solely due to the 
thing itself (the possessing of F) but in virtue of the second 
disjunct of P (in regard to F ˄ G).4 
Final extrinsic esteems are paradigmatic cases for this 
second mode of the givenness. Since, however, the foun-
dational property P is disjunctive, this second mode of the 
givenness exists independently of the first case. For this 
reason hyperintensional explanation of intrinsic properties 
stands in accordance with the proposed strong non-
reductionistic view of final esteems (NR-S). 
                                                      
4 Bear in mind: In extensional terms, it is a matter of these differing modes of 
the givenness around the possessing of one and the same disjunctive property

Up the ladder or down into the mire – Some remarks on Husserl’s 
and Wittgenstein’s view of the “ordinary” – with respect to PI 129 
Alfred Schmidt 
Vienna, Austria | alfred.schmidt@onb.ac.at  
Abstract 
The general topic of my paper is the relation of philosophy and the “ordinary”, - the specific aim is to offer an interpretation of PI 
129. Wittgenstein’s first model of this relation can be described as the ladder-model (Tractatus 6.54). Later he rejected this view 
as arrogant and dogmatic, trusting in the “health of the ordinary” (St. Cavell). When we leave the solid ground of ordinary lan-
guage, confusions and misunderstandings occur (PI 116, 132). But Wittgenstein insists that in philosophy we cannot avoid be-
ing dragged into the “mire” (0f skepticism). In contrast, Edmund Husserl’s concept of the “phenomenological epochè” leaves the 
solid ground of the ordinary intentionally to unveil a sublime realm of (anonymous) acts of  sense-constitution, which are hidden 
in the ordinary view of the world (“natural attitude”). For the phenomenological model as well as for Wittgenstein’s hidden as-
pects in front of our eyes (PI 129) the concept of aspect-seeing from PI II,xi provides a key of interpretation. 
 
 
1. Wittgenstein’s ladder and the (philoso-
phical) mire 
The concept of the “ordinary” and its relation to philosophy 
seems to be one of the most fruitful topics when looking for 
parallels between phenomenology and Wittgenstein. For 
the later Husserl the concept of the “Lebenswelt” (life-
world) moves to the center, a concept which is not far from 
Wittgenstein’s “Lebensform”.  (e.g. PI II, xi. “What has to 
be accepted, the given, is—so one could say—forms of 
life.”) As pointed out especially by Stanley Cavell, the later 
Wittgenstein shows a fundamental confidence in the “men-
tal health of the ordinary” (Cavell 1988) – as opposed to 
most philosophers since Descartes. But nevertheless - in 
Cavell’s view - Wittgenstein’s aim is not a final refutation of 
skepticism as was maybe the goal of philosophers like 
Moore or Austin, but on the contrary to show its intrinsic 
legitimation or power (Cavell 1988a, p.107). PI 129 is the 
final focus of this considerations, -   but some detours are 
necessary to come there.  
In a draft of a foreword from November 1930 Wittgen-
stein writes: 
„I might say, if the place I want to reach could only be 
climbed up to by a ladder, I would give up trying to get 
there. For the place to which I really have to go is one 
that I must actually be at already. Anything that can be 
reached with a ladder does not interest me.“ (BEE, MS 
109, p. 207/8) 
It is evident that in this quotation Wittgenstein is referring 
implicitly to the famous ladder-metaphor in Tractatus 6.54: 
 
Tractatus 6.54 implies that we need a philosophical 
ladder (= philosophical theory) to come to the right 
view of the world. 
 
We have to climb up the ladder before we can 
throw it away. 
 
Throwing away the ladder also means we never 
can come back to the ground (of the “ordinary”). 
The ladder metaphor in MS 109 shows a significant shift of 
the focus, which is essential for Wittgenstein’s later phi-
losophy. Now the ladder itself is said to be useless, be-
cause it leads us to a place we are no longer interested in. 
At that point I want to make a short reference to what 
Stanley Cavell calls “the myth of leading back the words” 
(Cavell 1988, p. 254), i.e. his lucid interpretation of PI 116, 
where Wittgenstein expresses one of his central methodo-
logical principles: 
“116. When philosophers use a word—"knowledge", 
"being", "object", "I", "proposition", "name"—and try to 
grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask 
oneself: is the word ever actually used in this way in the 
language-game which is its original home?— What we 
do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to 
their everyday use.” 
When we try to bring back words to their home (“Heimat”) 
it is implicitly expressed that in their philosophical / meta-
physical use they have lost their home. They got lost in a 
strange kind of exile, straying around without an appropri-
ate work. (PI 132). So – as Cavell puts it – they are like 
lost sheep which have to be brought back to their home by 
the philosophical shepherd. And this means for Cavell also 
the forms of life where these words are embedded have to 
return home. But that is only one side:  at the same time 
Cavell insists that the temptation to leave our home and 
get lost in a metaphysical exile of our words – what he 
calls “the temptation of skepticism” - can never be elimi-
nated completely, it is a part of ourselves as human bee-
ings. Wittgenstein confirms this interpretation explicitly in 
his lectures from 1934, describing philosophy as a three-
fold activity:  
„You must not try to avoid a philosophical problem by 
appealing to common sense; instead, present it as it 
arises with most power, you must allow yourself to 
be dragged into the mire, and get out of it. Philosophy 
can be said to consist of three activities: to see the 
common sense answer, to get yourself so deeply into 
the problem that the commonsense answer is unbear-
able, and to get from that situation back to the common 
sense answer. But the commonsense answer in it-
self is no solution. One must not in philosophy at-
tempt to short-circuit problems.” (Wittgenstein 1979, 
p.108/09, my accentuations) 
The philosopher cannot stay in the solid ground of the “or-
dinary” insisting that there are no philosophical confusions 
in our ordinary use of words. The commonsense answer 
becomes “unbearable” to the philosopher. He has to allow 
himself to be drawn into the philosophical mire.  
The following diagram shows the significant change in 
the view of philosophy from ‘up the ladder’ to ‘down into 
the mire’ – and back.

Illustration 1: The Wittgensteinian model 
The ascending model of philosophy, climbing up to the 
right view of the world, becomes obsolete for the later 
Wittgenstein. Now he rejects that kind of philosophy as 
“dogmatic and arrogant” (Wittgenstein 1984, p. 182 ff.; 
from Dec. 9.12.1931). But also in the later descending 
model, there is an ascending part leading us back from the 
mire to the “home of the ordinary”. This way back from the 
mire to the solid ground of the “ordinary” is the key of Witt-
genstein’s therapeutic method of philosophy. Wittgenstein 
warns us against philosophical excursions which don’t of-
fer a way back. 
As Herbert Hrachovec expressed it: 
"His [Wittgenstein’s] criticism is directed against the 
way in which classical philosophy relates to everyday 
life. Offensive is their inability to rediscover a way out of 
their problems back to the starting point, the everyday 
unproblematic. The traditional philosophy stylized  this 
inability to very specific results. Stupid is not that it 
leads into the mire, but that it offers mire blossoms 
(“Sumpfblüten”) instead of a way back to dry land. " 
(Hrachovec 1990, p.270 ; my translation from German) 
One seduction of the traditional philosopher is to stay in 
the mire, fascinated by the exotic blossoms. Another is to 
pick these blossoms and bring them back to the dry land of 
the “ordinary”, - because what he brings back changes to 
trivialities or plain nonsense. 
2. Husserl’s way in the mire: the “phe-
nomenological epochè”  
Now directing the attention to Edmund Husserl’s view of 
the ordinary, I will concentrate on the relation of what he 
calls “natural attitude” (“natürliche Einstellung”) in contrast 
to the “phenomenological attitude”. The natural attitude is 
characterized by the “general thesis of the natural attitude 
(“Generalthesis der natürlichen Einstellung”, Ideas I, §30) 
meaning that the objects of our natural world are experi-
enced as just being there, we take them as pre-given. Fol-
lowing his main principle (Husserl 1979, §55): “all real uni-
ties are unities of sense”, phenomenological investigation 
undertakes to unveil the hidden acts of sense constitution. 
But to do so, we first have to change our attitude radically, 
we have to execute an intentional jump out of our com-
monsense view, what Husserl since 1905 calls the phe-
nomenological reduction or “epochè”.  
Why is this radical change of our attitude necessary in 
Husserl’s view? 
We have “to put the world in brackets”, because only 
then we can see the intentional acts which constitute the 
pre-given objects as unities of sense. In the natural atti-
tude we always refer to the ready results of our – hidden – 
intentional acts of sense-constitution. They happen 
anonymously as long as we do not reflect on them, which 
means carrying out the epochè. 
“Yet there can be a completely different sort of waking 
life involved in the conscious having of the world. It 
would consist in a transformation of the thematic con-
sciousness of the world which breaks through the nor-
mality of straightforward living. Let us direct our atten-
tion to the fact that in general the world or, rather, ob-
jects are not merely pregiven to us all in such a way 
that we simply have them as the substrates of their 
properties, but that we become conscious of them (and 
of everything ontically meant) through subjective man-
ners of appearance, or [manners of givenness, without 
noticing it in particular; in fact we are for the most part 
not even aware of it at all. “ (Husserl 1970, § 38)  
Husserl’s aim is to understand the pre-given fundaments of 
our “Lebenswelt” by investigating the hidden intentional 
acts that constitute them. These mental activities usually 
happen “anonymously” i.e. unnoticed as long as we stay in 
a natural attitude. They can be unveiled only by carrying 
out the epochè. – 
 
 
Illustration 2:  The Husserlian model 
In Husserl's view we cannot get a philosophical under-
standing of the ordinary, the pre-given ground from within. 
Only a radical change of our attitude allows us to discover 
the constituting acts of consciousness as something that 
has always been there but unnoticed. After executing the 
phenomenological epochè we never can come back to our 
old naivety, but we can understand it (Husserl 1970, 
p.214). 
3. Conclusion: the “uncanniness of the or-
dinary”  
Coming back to PI 129:  
“129. The aspects of things that are most important for 
us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity. 
(One is unable to notice something—because it is al-
ways before one's eyes.) The real foundations of his 
enquiry do not strike a man at all. Unless that fact has 
at some time struck him.—And this means: we fail to be 
struck by what, once seen, is most striking and most 
powerful.” 
What does Wittgenstein mean with the most important as-
pects hidden in front of our eyes? 
Husserl’s phenomenological method seems to be a per-
fect example, how the most important aspects of things are 
hidden in our ordinary view. They are invisible, because 
we usually do not direct our attention to them. It is 
Husserl’s main philosophical intention to make these hid-
den aspects (subjective acts of sense-constitution) visible 
for us; his method of the phenomenological epochè is the 
tool to make this possible.

247
But what is Wittgenstein’s view? There are some re-
marks, which seem to be very close to the phenomenol-
ogical approach. Remarks like this: 
“That we don’t notice anything when we look around in 
space, feel our own bodies, etc. etc., shows how natu-
ral these very things are to us. We don’t perceive that 
we see space perspectivally, or that our visual image is 
in some sense blurred towards the edge. We never no-
tice this, and can never notice it, because it is the mode 
of our perception. We never think about it, and it is im-
possible to do so, because there is no opposite to the 
form of our world.” (BEE MS 108, p.47/48 from Dec. 
1929).  
Pi 129 could be interpreted exactly in that way. - But Witt-
genstein’s view of the ordinary and its hidden aspects 
keeps an indissoluble tension: on the one hand his claim, 
that in philosophy everything lies open in front of our eyes, 
whatever is hidden is not of interest for us  (PI 126), on the 
other hand “the most important aspects of things are hid-
den”, also - or even because they are always in front of 
our eyes (PI 129). (Psychologist may call this “habitua-
tion”.) 
In PI 129 Wittgenstein already uses the word “aspect” as 
a central key term. It is obvious that this oscillation of the 
ordinary between the open apparent and hidden corre-
sponds exactly to what Wittgenstein later - in part II of the 
PI (the “duck-rabbit“, section xi) - describes as “aspect-
change” Also Husserl’s phenomenological epochè can be 
understood  as a kind of philosophical aspect-switch, 
which he calls change of our ‘attitude’. Only if we are able 
to change our attitude (Einstellung / Auffassung) a new  - 
before hidden  - aspect might become visible for us. 
In MS 136 (p. 104b, from 1948) Wittgenstein explains: 
“Any such thoughts "It may also be understood as" 
brings, so to say, an aspect to light. That means: the 
emerging view, the changing of the view generates 
the dawning of an aspect; i.e.: the lighting up of what 
we call "aspect".” (my accentuation) 
But how can we change our view of things in order to learn 
to see new hidden aspects of things? Wittgenstein’s an-
swer is  –  as I wanted to show –  we have to allow our-
selves to be dragged down into the philosophical mire. 
First we have to break free of the dominating usual aspect, 
because it hides the other aspects of things. If one is to-
tally captured by the view of the duck, he will never see the 
rabbit. Only in a step of getting in distance to the usual as-
pect, it is possible to see a new one.  
Husserl and Wittgenstein both agree that philosophy 
cannot stay within the “ordinary” but have to pass through 
a kind of crisis. Stanley Cavell puts his finger on the same 
point, when he writes:   
“The answer [of the traditional philosopher ] to it tells us 
something true about the world and about knowledge, 
but something we had not noticed before, something 
our prejudices or our complacent practicality prevented 
us from noticing.” (Cavell 1979, p.135)  
In philosophy we can learn to see new aspects - maybe 
the most important ones– by a change of our usual view or 
attitude, beginning with the feeling of uncanniness of the 
ordinary. And this is  - as I think - exactly what Husserl 
wants to show, with his method of the epochè.   
For the later Wittgenstein the claim of philosophy for a 
special position high above the “ordinary” becomes arro-
gant and obsolete; but also staying within the common 
sense view is “unbearable” for the philosopher. We have to 
accept to be drawn into the mire (of skepticism) in order to 
learn to see the “most striking and most powerful aspects 
of things”, which otherwise are hidden in front of our eyes. 
But we have also to find the way back to the dry land, 
guided by the grammar of our language, knowing that  
“Essence is expressed by grammar.” (PI 371)

Constructive Mathematics – Descriptive Philosophy 
Franz Schörkhuber 
Vienna, Austria | schoerkhuber@gmx.net 
Abstract 
In my talk I shall give a general outline of Wittgenstein’s views on both mathematics and philosophical method. By doing so I 
aim to bring about that there is an intrinsic relation between how we think about mathematical reasoning and the picture we cre-
ate of our own understanding of philosophy. Particularly, I want to show that Wittgenstein’s thoughts about mathematics could 
elucidate his remarks on philosophical method. 
 
 
The mathematician creates essences. (RFM I, §32) 
Essence is expressed by grammar. (PI, §371) 
Our investigation is therefore a grammatical one.  
(PI, §90) 
1. Descriptive Philosophy 
On several places within the Philosophical Investigations 
we find Wittgenstein talking about philosophy. The picture 
he draws of philosophical practice is particularly character-
ized by its elucidative traits. Philosophical problems are 
thus identified as the result as well as the expression of 
conceptual misunderstandings, based on too narrow a 
view of how we actually put our words to use. The philoso-
pher’s business is not to construe new doctrines; rather 
she is asked to clarify the diverse meanings of those words 
which provoked our misunderstandings in the first place. 
Hence, it is not by theorizing, but by describing both actual 
and fictive ways of using words that we get rid of philoso-
phical problems. 
Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use 
of language; it can in the end only describe it.  
For it cannot give it any foundation either.  
It leaves everything as it is. (PI, §124) 
Philosophy simply puts everything before us, and nei-
ther explains nor deduces anything.—Since everything 
lies open to view there is nothing to explain. For what is 
hidden, for example, is of no interest to us. (PI, §126) 
If one tried to advance theses in philosophy, it would 
never be possible to debate over them, because every-
one could agree to them. (PI, §128) 
Such statements could provoke the reader’s contradiction. 
What about these remarks themselves, one might ask: 
don’t they figure as a quite dogmatically presented theory 
of philosophy? Isn’t it a questionable thesis, if it’s said that 
it would never be possible to debate philosophical theses? 
And isn’t the daily practice of academic philosophizing the 
best proof for the contrary: that we have different opinions 
about a specific topic and that our assertions are at vari-
ance with each other? 
In my mind this manifests a typical reaction and several 
readers of the Investigations may have had similar 
thoughts. Thus it comes not as a surprise that we find ob-
jections along these lines also within the literature on Witt-
genstein’s account of philosophy. Anthony Kenny, for ex-
ample, identifies the remarks just quoted as belonging to 
Wittgenstein’s theory of philosophy which purportedly can-
not be brought into harmony with the philosophical praxis 
as demonstrated in the Investigations. And he confesses: 
Though I have tried my best to do so I do not believe 
that it is, in the end, possible to reconcile Wittgenstein’s 
account of philosophy with the entirety of his philoso-
phical activity in the Investigations. […] The metaphi-
losophy, it might be claimed, is an inadequate account 
even of Wittgenstein’s own philosophy. (Kenny 2004, 
181) 
In the same manner Paul Howich, in his new book on 
“Wittgenstein’s Metaphilosophy”, distinguishes between 
meta-philosophical claims on the one hand and the phi-
losophical practice which they ought to capture on the 
other. He would, in the end, not agree with Kenny’s nega-
tive diagnosis that Wittgenstein says things about philoso-
phy which are contradicted by what he himself is practic-
ing. Still, in a first approach, Horwich seems to accept that 
one ought to discriminate between philosophical practice 
and meta-philosophical reflections concerning that prac-
tice. And he is thus led to similar questions: 
[Wittgenstein] says that the goal of philosophy is not to 
formulate and establish theories, but rather to clear 
away confusions produced by language. But is not this 
claim about the nature of philosophy itself a theory? So 
isn’t Wittgenstein’s metaphilosophy self-contradictory? 
(Horwich 2013, 17) 
In a first response to such a critique one might simply point 
at §81 of the Investigations, where Wittgenstein writes 
“that in philosophy we often compare the use of words with 
games and calculi which have fixed rules, but cannot say 
that someone who is using language must be playing such 
a game.” (PI, §81) His remarks on philosophy wouldn’t 
constitute an exhaustive description of language use then, 
but gave merely expression to one particular way of using 
that concept, i.e., one kind of doing philosophy. In this 
sense, the grammatical remarks on the status, aim and 
method of philosophizing are simply designed to determine 
one possible game amongst others—without denying that 
other people may attempt to use the word differently. 
In my eyes, an answer along these lines is on the right 
track. It is true, and Wittgenstein himself gives explicit ex-
pression to this in §121 of PI, that his remarks on philoso-
phy stand on level with all the other grammatical remarks 
of his book: they should be handled as objects of compari-
son which do not describe anthropological facts, but repre-
sent possible ways of operating with words. 
Still, such an answer doesn’t suffice. For it suggests that 
in philosophizing one was merely sketching various con-
cept-applications, without saying anything about their con-
nection to actually established language use. Yet, in fact, 
we do not want haphazardly chosen definitions, but are 
interested in comparisons which do really teach us some-
thing about the workings of language. Given that Wittgen-

stein presents a peculiar picture of philosophy, we should 
therefore ask what reasons we have to adopt it. 
Hence, in what follows I aim to show that it is not a cas-
ual penchant on Wittgenstein’s side that he emphasizes 
the descriptive and elucidatory traits as eminently charac-
teristic of philosophical practices. I want to make vivid that 
if we searched for an understanding of the principles (or 
modalities) of the experience in philosophy we couldn’t do 
better than to proceed descriptively; that the descriptive 
account of philosophy as promoted by Wittgenstein is ac-
tually the best way to preserve the idea that in philosophiz-
ing we are not concerned with contingent states of affairs, 
but with the essentials.—The way in which I shall proceed 
leads over Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics. 
2. Constructive Mathematics 
The most notable of Wittgenstein’s thoughts about 
mathematics is that he wants to consider mathematicians 
not as discoverers, but as inventors (cf. RFM I, §168). The 
idea that in doing mathematics we discover something 
about the objects of mathematical inquiry may be pro-
voked by what we actually experience while being shown a 
mathematical demonstration. For example, in calculating 
we are confronted with a process yielding results which we 
might have not expect beforehand. And this can make us 
say that what has been proven is very akin to what we find 
in the sciences by help of experiment – except that what’s 
mathematically proven is much more certain than the con-
tingent results of experiential investigations. Mathematical 
propositions are thus likened to physical descriptions, al-
beit they do not express contingent facts, but necessary 
truths. Mathematical proof is then viewed as an experiment 
which grants the truth of necessary propositions by show-
ing the mathematical facts to exist, virtually a tool that al-
lows one to look into mathematical spheres like the tele-
scope opens up vast regions which had been inaccessible 
to the bare eye. 
In order to lower the attractions of that picture, Wittgen-
stein emphasizes the difference of usage that make a 
proposition either into a mathematical or an experiential 
one. Let’s take the sentence “In the sequence of whole 
numbers 13 follows after 12” as our example. One could of 
course say that this proposition asserts a truth about a row 
of numbers printed in an exercise book. This might be an 
empirical proposition, its truth-value depending, amongst 
others, on the accuracy of the typesetter. And equally arbi-
trary is the proposition that there will be 13 nuts on the ta-
ble if we add another nut to a given dozen; for who grants 
that? 
What we really want to say with our proposition 
“12+1=13” is something different; namely, the rules are 
thus that we should only say of that person that she had 
written down a sequence of whole numbers if 12 was ac-
tually followed by 13. And similarly we say that one nut 
must have disappeared, if there were no longer 13 nuts on 
the table; thereby using 12+1=13 as our paradigm of judg-
ing. That is to say, the proposition is not describing any-
thing, but constitutes a rule for how to use signs, for how to 
judge. And the claim that this proposition corresponds to 
reality can then only mean that it has proved most useful 
to use signs in such a way; that it has, e. g., proved useful 
to search the floor if  there were only twelve nuts on the 
table after having added another one to a given dozen. 
Thus, in the Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics, 
Wittgenstein writes: 
There is no discovery that 13 follows 12. That’s our 
technique – we fix, we teach, our technique that way. If 
there is a discovery – it is that this is a valuable thing to 
do. (LFM, 83) 
Mathematical propositions are thus viewed by Wittgenstein 
as grammatical rules. It is not due to some peculiar nature 
of those eternal affairs which they purportedly describe 
that we call them necessary. Rather, in using them as 
paradigms for describing and judging, i.e. by letting them 
guide our actions, we give them their incontestable status. 
In the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics he 
says about a quite similar notion (“449 is followed in the 
cardinal row by 450”) that by taking it as a mathematical 
proposition an empirical regularity becomes transformed 
into something solid; a proposition “dependent on experi-
ence” is made “independent of it” by being given the role of 
an “object of comparison” (LFM, 55). 
It is as if we had hardened the empirical proposition into 
a rule. And now we have, not a hypothesis that gets 
tested by experience, but a paradigm with which ex-
perience is compared and judged.  And so a new kind 
of judgement [, a new language game]. (RFM VI, §22; 
cf. BEE 164, 60) 
In providing us with different techniques of comparison 
mathematicians do not experimentally discover things, but 
create new concepts through the construction of proof. 
Hence, Wittgenstein does not view mathematical proof as 
unlocking hitherto hidden spheres of mathematical truths, 
as it were “the physics of mathematical entities” (LFM, 
138). Rather, he aims to bring about that the purpose of 
mathematical calculation and proof lies in providing us with 
new concepts, new techniques of classifying and compar-
ing things. Mathematics does not investigate the essence 
of things, but construes new concepts—and thus brings 
into being what we shall henceforth designate as essential. 
The proof doesn’t explore the essence [of the two fig-
ures], but it does express what I am going to count as 
belonging to the essence [of the figures] from now 
on.—I deposit what belongs to the essence among the 
paradigms of language.  
The mathematician creates essences. (RFM I, §32) 
Time and again Wittgenstein points out the huge differ-
ence between a mathematical investigation and an ex-
perimental one. As we have seen above, this is not to say 
that we were not able to look at constructions in school 
books as experiments with ink on the paper, or even to 
view what is happening in the class rooms as experiments 
about how children react on these signs (cf. RFM III, 
§67e). But ordinarily we do not use mathematical demon-
strations in such a way; we do not accept a proof leading 
one time to this and another time to that result. Rather, we 
take the result to be part of the proof, i.e., in reproducing it 
“we reproduce not merely the conditions which once 
yielded this result (as in an experiment), but the result it-
self” (RFM III, §55). 
This is why Wittgenstein writes that “causality plays no 
part in the proof” (RFM IV, §41), meaning that the identity 
of a mathematical structure is determined by itself, and 
does not depend on further (empirical) investigations. For 
only if the constructions yielded grounds for accepting 
them as models can the mathematician be said to invent 
new concepts (cf. RFM III, §§9, 29). Yet, in order to make 
us adopt a new paradigm for judging, we have to be able 
to identify and reproduce it without further ado (cf. RFM III, 
§§1, 21, 44). Therefore a mathematical proof “must be 
surveyable” (RFM III, §§1, 22, 39, 55; IV, §41); which does 
not mean that the whole pattern is to be captured within a 

Constructive Mathematics – Descriptive Philosophy | Franz Schörkhuber 
 
 
 250
glimpse, but only that she who has gone through the proof 
with understanding also knows how to reproduce it. 
The aspects just mentioned— (1) the mathematician as 
inventor of concepts, (3) the identity of process and result 
in mathematics, (3) the emphasis on the surveyability of 
proof—all these aspects shall emphasize that in mathe-
matics we are concerned with internal relations: not with 
contingent relations among objects, but with grammatical 
relations among concepts (cf. LFM, 73). Now, an intrinsic 
relation can only be demonstrated by putting the relata 
next to each other, not by referring to something external. 
For whenever we tried to explain it by another entity, the 
relation hinges on our way of referring, thereby losing its 
paradigmatic status.—Thus Wittgenstein’s constructivist 
outlook, according to which mathematical proof specifies 
“the grammar of our language” (RFM III, §31) by providing 
us with new “objects of comparison” (LFM, 55). 
3. Junction 
Let’s now return to what Wittgenstein said about philoso-
phy. My aim is to bring about that Wittgenstein’s picture of 
philosophy—in short, it’s descriptive and non-theoretical 
features—could be motivated by his reflections on mathe-
matics. 
As we’ve just heard, mathematical necessity is better not 
to be understood as the property of an object, but should 
rather be conceived as a function of how we put our ex-
pressions to use. The a priori status of mathematical 
propositions is thus the result of using them as paradigms 
for meaningful discourse (or, more generally, as the meas-
ure we use in making sense). Given the philosopher’s de-
mand not to be liable to the contingencies of the natural 
sciences, it is natural to cope with these insights concern-
ing mathematical necessity just as much when it comes to 
presenting one’s philosophical ideas. That is to say, a phi-
losophical observation yields normative content precisely 
insofar as it is possible to accept the presented pattern as 
a standard for looking at the phenomena in question (cf. 
PI, §141). 
To acknowledge a specific statement as philosophical is 
thus not to judge whether it was true or false, but to recog-
nize it as a possible (and maybe fertile) representation or 
diction. Ultimately, the use we make of the Investigations’s 
propositions gives them their philosophical significance. 
This is why Wittgenstein writes that “we can avoid inept-
ness or emptiness in our assertions only by presenting the 
model as what it is, as an object of comparison—as, so to 
speak, a measuring-rod; not as a preconceived idea to 
which reality must correspond.” (PI, §131) 
In fact, philosophy “speaks of sentences and words in 
exactly the sense in which we speak of them in ordinary 
live”; yet at the same time—and this point is, in my view, 
missed by Paul Horwich and Anthony Kenny—“we talk 
about it as we do about the pieces in chess when we are 
stating the rules of game, not describing their physical 
properties.” (PI, §108) A grammatical remark is not allud-
ing to language as an anthropological phenomenon and 
can therefore not be falsified by contrary evidence. It only 
designates a possible use of words, which is neither true 
nor false, but more or less instrumental in one’s philosoph-
ical project. As useful as the phrase “2+2=4” is in our eve-
ryday handling of nuts, steins and other things—as useful 
a philosophical remark might be as an object of compari-
son, presenting an outlook we are ready to take in. 
We do, however, only accept that as a model which 
manifests its own criteria of identity, for we have to be able 
to apply (and hence to reproduce) it without further inspec-
tion. Thus it is not very surprising that what Wittgenstein 
emphasized as essential regarding mathematical proof, i.e. 
their perspicuity, is also “of fundamental significance” (PI, 
§122) when it comes to philosophical argument. As little 
place as there is for hypothetical elements within mathe-
matical proof (cf. RFM IV, §41), as little a role should it 
play within philosophical investigations (cf. PI, §109). And 
this can be ensured by simply putting the relata before us 
(cf. PI, §126), making thus plain the intrinsic relations be-
tween them. 
But even if philosophical assertions are not true or false, 
still one may ask whether the schema presented by a 
grammatical remark was of any help at all, i.e. whether we 
are willing to hold fast to it. Consequently, the usefulness 
of a philosophical remark depends, first of all, on what 
goals one pursues with doing philosophy. And there are, of 
course, more alternatives here. Marking only two extreme 
tendencies, there are, on the one hand, those thinkers who 
aim to construe a maximally coherent conceptual system 
which allows them to capture virtually all phenomena in 
one singular language; and there are, on the other hand, 
those (like the later Wittgenstein) who take such a simplify-
ing tendency to be the very source of philosophical confu-
sion. Their aim is thus not to strive for a general account of 
anything, but to dissolve particular misunderstanding by 
investigating the respective concepts. 
Yet, in neither of both cases can a philosophical obser-
vation be said to contradict another. Being part of a con-
ceptual investigation, philosophical propositions do not 
describe the lingual behaviour of humans, i.e., they do not 
refer to language as an empirical phenomenon. What they 
describe or represent is only possible ways of represent-
ing: paradigms or objects of comparison which are of more 
or less help for the pursued purpose. 
It would never be possible to debate over theses in phi-
losophy, because a philosophical thesis would have the 
form: ‘One can look at things that way’. And thereupon one 
may respond with saying that she is not willing to take that 
view herself; but on cannot say that one couldn’t. Because 
that one can look at things in such and such a way is sim-
ply proven by having done so. That there are debates in 
philosophy, cannot be explained by the mere fact that 
somebody advanced a philosophical theses. Rather, it is 
because somebody who wants to look at things this or that 
way (whatever reasons and motives she may have for do-
ing so) presents her form of representation at the same 
time as such as if everybody had to cling to it. Yet this is 
not a philosophical thesis, but the dogmatic result of con-
fusing a conceptual possibility with “perceiving a state of 
affairs of the highest generality” (PI, §104).—A misunder-
standing concerning one’s own approach that is idiosyn-
cratic of metaphysics. 
Philosophical investigations: conceptual investigations. 
The substance of metaphysic: that the difference be-
tween factual and conceptual investigations is not clear 
to it. The metaphysical statement always appears as 
factual, although the problem is a conceptual. (BEE 
134, 153)

Waismann as an unhappy prophet of Wittgenstein 
Radek Schuster 
Pilsen, Czech Republic | schust@kfi.zcu.cz  
Abstract 
The paper deals with the cooperation between Wittgenstein and Waismann under Schlick’s patronage in the period of 1928-
1936. Firstly, the purport and historical development of the project Logik, Sprache, Philosophie which was meant to systemati-
cally present the ideas of the Tractatus and later also Wittgenstein’s new philosophy is reconstructed. Secondly, the transition 
from the “principle of verification” to the conceptions of “hypothesis” and “criteria” is expounded. Thirdly, the controversy that 
arose due to Waismann’s “insufficient” acknowledgement of Wittgenstein in a paper on identity is recalled. These three exposi-
tions are intended as arguments for the reconsideration of, first, Waismann’s alleged plagiarism or misinterpretation of Wittgen-
stein, and, second, Wittgenstein’s purported reluctance to set up a scholarly-like theory of semantics. 
 
 
Wittgenstein's thoughts importantly inspired and influenced 
the logical empiricism of the Vienna Circle. At the same 
time, however, they gradually alienated Schlick and Wais-
mann, who revered Wittgenstein, from Neurath and Car-
nap, who were skeptical particularly but not only about 
Wittgenstein’s mysticism. Neurath summarized the situati-
on in his letter to Carnap (20.8.1932) as follows: “Wie nett 
könnte Wittgenstein unter uns leben, wie einer von uns. Er 
wäre so verwöhnt werden. Gel? Statt dessen ist der der 
Gott und Waismann sein armer Prophet.“ (McGuinness 
2002, 193) The following exposition focuses on Wais-
mann's thankless role as an interpreter and disseminator 
of Wittgenstein’s ideas within the circle and beyond. The 
aim is to reconsider, first, Waismann’s alleged plagiarism 
and misinterpretation of Wittgenstein, and, second, Witt-
genstein’s purported reluctance to set up a scholarly-like 
theory of semantics. 
1. Exchange of ideas: the project Logik, 
Sprache, Philosophie  
“Dieses Buch, nach meiner unerschütterlichen Überzeu-
gung das bedeutendste Werk der Philosophie unserer 
Zeit, ist nicht einer bestimmten »Richtung« zuzurechnen, 
aber es wird auch in ihm die fundamentale Wahrheit ver-
fochten, auf der aller Empirismus aufruht, denn es zeigt die 
Unmöglichkeit synthetischer Urteile a priori.“ (Waismann 
1976, 20)  – This was written by Schlick about TLP in 1928 
in his introduction to Waismann’s upcoming book later an-
nounced in Erkenntnis I under the title Logik, Sprache, Phi-
losophie  (LSP). The book was originally intended as a 
synoptic and systematic exposition of key ideas of TLP 
and at the same time as the first volume of the series of 
logical empiricism Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Wel-
tauffassung. Later on, it was also meant to present Witt-
genstein’s new thoughts derived from conversations with 
Waismann and Schlick such as the principle of verification 
and his notions of hypotheses and criteria. Nevertheless 
the project finally underwent a dramatic evolution on the 
level of ideas as well as on the level of the personal rela-
tionship between Wittgenstein and Waismann. Though the 
latter held the former in high esteem, at least in the begin-
ning of their co-operation, it was chiefly Schlick’s patron-
age and encouragement that kept the two involved in the 
project, which definitely broke up with Schlick’s murder in 
1936.  
In the first stage of the project which lasted until Decem-
ber 1931, Waismann, as Wittgenstein's expositor, was re-
sponsible for the whole text of LSP and played the formal 
role of Wittgenstein’s spokesman at meetings of the Vi-
enna Circle and beyond, e.g. when he delivered a lecture 
on Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics at the 
Königsberg conference in September 1930. From this pe-
riod, several important documents originated: Thesen, 
some lectures, drafts and most of the conversation records 
that survived in Waismann’s Nachlass and which can help 
us to conceive of the content of the initial version of LSP. 
As Wittgenstein was moving from the standpoints of TLP, 
evidently much more radically than Waismann and Schlick 
were able to concede, he became convinced that Wais-
mann was presenting his recent ideas in a form completely 
different from what he regarded as correct (see the letter to 
Schlick from 20.11.1931).  In the second phase of the pro-
ject, Waismann’s task was thus not to present just an ex-
tension or modification of TLP but rather a new Wittgen-
steinian philosophy. For this purpose, Waismann was pro-
vided with Wittgenstein’s dictations to Schlick and Wittgen-
stein’s own typescripts (apparently parts of Philosophical 
Grammar, The Blue and Brown Books, TS 211 and The 
Big Typescript). 
In the third stage that begun by Easter 1934, Wittgen-
stein was even meant to act as a co-author responsible for 
the overall plan and structure of the book while Waismann 
was expected to integrate particular passages by a syn-
thesis of Wittgenstein’s words from conversations, dicta-
tions and typescripts. However, this modus operandi did 
not work well and the cooperation being unsatisfactory for 
both of the two it gradually expired during the first half of 
1935. Especially for Waismann, the joint work had to be 
difficult and frustrating because Wittgenstein always con-
sidered things as if for the first time and following a sudden 
inspiration destroyed what he had previously propounded 
(see Waismann’s letter to Schlick from 9.8.1934). Wittgen-
stein finally withdrew from the project, at the same time, 
however, he authorized Schlick and Waismann to continue 
in the way they regarded convenient. (As Baker puts it, he 
washed his hands of what he had called “die Waismanns-
sache”. (Waismann 2003, xxviii)) 
Early in 1937, Waismann finalized the book and planned 
to publish it himself in Holland under his own name and 
with a dedication to Schlick’s memory. An English transla-
tion of the text made by Margaret (Paul) Ramsey in 1938 -
1939 was also send to the publisher. Unfortunately, none 
of these versions was released, apparently not only due to 
the outbreak of the Second World War but also because 
Waismann himself decided not to publish the text. In 
Waismann’s Nachlass the galley proofs of the English ver-
sion and earlier drafts of the German text survived. The 
book was published only posthumously, first in English 
under the title The Principles of Linguistic Philosophy

(Waismann 1965) and later the original German version 
was reconstructed and released as Logik, Sprache, Phi-
losphie (Waismann 1976). (For a more detailed history of 
LSP see Baker 1979, or Baker’s introductions to Wais-
mann 1997 and 2003.) 
2. Metamorphosis of ideas: from verifica-
tionism to the concept of criteria   
Waismann’s LSP, conversation records (Waismann 1967) 
and preparatory material and drafts related to LSP (Wais-
mann 2003) can serve as a unique testimony of the devel-
opment of Wittgenstein’s philosophical grammar in the pe-
riod of 1929-1936. In this convoluted and many-layered 
deposit, we can excavate reflections on the concept of 
elementary propositions and the picture theory of language 
on the one hand and the conception of meaning as the 
way an expression is applied on the other hand. Let us 
now focus shortly on Wittgenstein’s transition from his veri-
ficationist position to his conceptions of a hypothesis and a 
criterion which exemplifies well the evolution of ideas in the 
course of the Wittgenstein-Waismann cooperation. 
It was soon obvious to Wittgenstein/Waismann (W/W) 
that the principle of verification – stating that the sense of a 
proposition is the method of its verification (we cannot look 
for something/ask questions without knowing how to look 
for it/how to identify the question) - ruled out many of our 
common and plausible statements as meaningless. Al-
though the principle was satisfactorily applied to mathe-
matics – the meaning of a mathematical concept is its use 
and the sense of a mathematical sentence is the method 
of its verification, i.e. the way the sentence is to be proved 
- in the empirical context only sense-data statements were 
able meet this demand. This was because only descrip-
tions of our immediate experiences seemed to refer di-
rectly to reality and hence could be verified conclusively.  
In contrast, our everyday statements about material ob-
jects, their features and the way other people perceive 
them could not be treated as genuine propositions clearly 
decidable as true or false. According to W/W these state-
ments were hypotheses. They represented objects, by 
means of using nouns, as spatially and temporally con-
nected aspects such as visual images and tactile sensa-
tions. W/W clarified this by a simile in which an object (as a 
hypothesis) is a body in space and particular aspects (ex-
pressed by sense-data or observational propositions) are 
the cross-sections cut through the body (see e.g. Wais-
mann 1967, 256). A hypothesis was only more or less 
probable because it could not be verified/falsified (in the 
sense of entailment) but rather dis/confirmed by proposi-
tions describing various aspects of an object, i.e. by evi-
dential “symptoms”. The hypotheses were grammatical 
rules for constructing genuine propositions and thus they 
explained our previous perceptions and predicted how we 
would experience objects from various different aspects in 
the future. 
Later on, the distinction between genuine propositions 
and hypotheses vanished because the idea of a proposi-
tion that could be conclusively verified by direct compari-
son with reality was abandoned and because it became 
clear that our everyday “hypothetical” statements are 
commonly understood and conveyed as true or false, i.e. 
as verified ones. Hence the dichotomy of a hypothesis and 
its supporting symptoms was superseded by the distinction 
between a statement and its criterion. In this relation, 
which was also established by grammar, the use of propo-
sitions and concepts was governed by various criteria in 
both the formal and material sense.  
3. The origin of ideas: authorship and ac-
knowledgement  
The dispute between Wittgenstein and Carnap concerning 
alleged plagiarism in Carnap’s paper Die physikalische 
Sprache als Universalsprache der Wissenschaft (Carnap 
1932) which was calmed by Schlick is well known. How-
ever, a similar controversy also arose between Wittgen-
stein and Waismann himself by the end of their coopera-
tion on the project LSP when the latter published his paper 
Über den Begriff der Identität (Waismann 1936). In this 
paper, which for the first time presented the notion of a 
“criterion of identity” showing that the expression “the 
same” had no strict sense but rather many related mean-
ings depending on criteria we decided to accept, Wais-
mann expressed his gratitude to Wittgenstein in a footnote: 
“Wertvolle Anregungen für die hier entwickelte Ansicht 
verdankt der Verfasser vielfachen Gesprächen mit Herrn 
Ludwig Wittgenstein, die u. a. auch den Begriff der Iden-
tität betrafen.“ (Waismann 1936, 56) 
Nevertheless, Wittgenstein was outraged by such defi-
cient acknowledgement and complained to Waismann 
recommending him to consult Schlick about how to put the 
matter right (letter of 19.5. 1936). Waismann apologized in 
his answer (letter of 27.5.1936) trying to explain his unfor-
tunate formulation: “Als ich mit dem Aufsatz fertig war, da 
wusste ich nicht recht, inwieweit Sie mit dem Inhalt einver-
standen sein würden und inwieweit nicht. Wenn ich nun 
den Aufsatz oder einen Teil desselben als Wiedergabe 
Ihrer Ideen bezeichnete, so war ich nicht sicher, ob Sie mir 
nicht erklären würden: ich habe Sie nicht verstanden oder 
ich habe Ihre Gedanken schief oder entstellt wiedergege-
ben. Ich bitte Sie, mich richtig zu verstehen und sich auch 
in meine Lage zu versetzen: ich glaube zwar, Ihre Ideen 
richtig zu verstehen, aber ganz gewiss wäre ich meiner 
Sache erst, wenn Sie das Manuskript lesen und mir Ihre 
Zustimmung erklären würden. So bleibt immer ein gewis-
ser Zweifel in mir zurück. In dieser Lage habe ich mich 
Prof. Schlick anvertraut und ihn um Rat gefragt, was ich da 
tun soll: ich möchte, dass Sie Ihr Recht erhalten und ande-
rerseits doch nicht, dass Sie die Verantwortung für irgend-
welche Fehler in der Durchführung trifft.“  
Although this intended rectification was never realized – 
the matter was evidently drowned by Schlick’s murder -  
Waismann learned his lesson from the controversy and in 
his next published paper developing Wittgenstein’s ideas 
he was much more explicit in his acknowledgement: “I 
wish to emphasize my indebtedness to Dr. Wittgenstein, to 
whom I owe not only a great part of the views expressed in 
this paper but also my whole method of dealing with phi-
losophical questions. Although I hope that the views ex-
pressed here are in agreement with those of Dr. Wittgen-
stein, I do not wish to ascribe to him any responsibility for 
them.” (Waismann 1938, 54) 
4. Conclusion  
Waismann’s papers including LSP can often give the im-
pression that they are second hand derivatives or even 
plagiarisms of Wittgenstein’s work but in the light of the 
above three short expositions it should be clear that such 
an evaluation is misleading and unjust to Waismann. 
Moreover, it is also obvious that Waismann’s systematic 
and lucid interpretations were very useful for Wittgenstein 
and served him as a mirror revealing confusions and im-
passes in his thoughts and at the same time accelerating 
his own development.

Furthermore, both Wittgenstein’s involvement in the pro-
ject LSP and his anxious worry about not being given offi-
cial credit for his ideas are in contrast with his alleged dis-
taste for academic philosophy and philosophical theoriz-
ing. In this connection, the question arises why Wittgen-
stein cooperated with Waismann on LSP at all while trying 
at the same time to write a book with similar content on his 
own as we can see, e.g., in The Big Typescript.

McDowell on Rule-Following and Moral Principles 
Daniel Sharp 
Vienna, Austria | Sharpdaniele@gmail.com  
Abstract 
John McDowell argues that Wittgenstein’s rule-following considerations tell against a picture of moral philosophy on which moral 
principles play a central role. Examining McDowell’s argument in conjunction with Wittgenstein’s text, I suggest only a consid-
erably more modest conclusion follows. Wittgenstein’s considerations only tell against a specific (set of) philosophical miscon-
ception(s) about the role of principles in moral practice. They should prompt a reexamination, rather than a rejection, of the role 
principles play in moral theory and practice. 
 
 
It is often assumed that principles pervade moral life: that 
moral judgment consists in bringing general principles to 
bear on particular cases and that sound judgment in hard 
cases requires one to have a requisite set of principles at 
one’s disposal. Moral theory has therefore been conceived 
as an attempt to formulate or articulate a coherent body of 
moral principles to guide practical deliberation. This picture 
of morality, however, has begun to catch flack (Dancy 
2004). 
One strategy marshaled against it, most notably by John 
McDowell, draws on Wittgenstein’s rule-following consid-
erations. Yet, this appeal remains controversial. While 
McDowell argues that the principled picture of morality 
“comes under radical attack in Wittgenstein's discus-
sion…of the concept of following a rule” (McDowell 1998, 
58), others counter that the rule-following considerations 
are “powerless” to provide even a “modest level of support” 
to the critic of principles (see, e.g. Lang 2001, 205-6).  
In this paper, I argue for something in-between. While 
the rule-following considerations do not tell against moral 
principles as such, they do cast doubt on a specific way of 
understanding such principles. I come to this conclusion by 
evaluating McDowell’s argument in conjunction with Witt-
genstein’s rule-following considerations. 
1. McDowell on Uncodifiability 
Moral principles, general conclusions about reasons for 
action, are the kinds of things we can act on, in accord 
with, or in breach of (Hare 1972). They are often taken to 
play (at least) two important roles in moral theory and prac-
tice. First, moral principles qua standards determine the 
criteria for application of moral predicates. Second, princi-
ples qua guides steer our practical reasoning. 
In Virtue and Reason, McDowell (1998) mounts an at-
tack on both roles which principles allegedly play, propos-
ing instead a particularist ethics of virtue (McDowell’s text 
is rich, and I will focus only on McDowell’s use of the rule-
following considerations to support these conclusions).  To 
motivate this alternative picture, McDowell denies that “any 
reasonably adult moral outlook” can be captured by a set 
of principles. He writes: 
"if one attempted to reduce one's conception of what 
virtue requires to a set of rules, then, however subtle 
and thoughtful one was in drawing up the code, cases 
would inevitably turn up in which a mechanical applica-
tion of the rules would strike one as wrong" [be-
cause]…one's mind on the matter was not susceptible 
of capture in any universal formula" (McDowell 1998, 
58).  
What McDowell takes to be uncodifiable is a sensitivity to 
the particular situation. Virtuous agents are guided not by 
principles, but by “an ability to recognize requirements that 
situations impose on one’s behavior” (Ibid, 53).  
McDowell’s thesis invites the conclusion that if this sensi-
tivity cannot be captured in principles, then principles can 
serve as neither guides nor standards. But, does this con-
clusion follow? If so, how does the argument work? And 
what does McDowell’s thesis have to do with the rule-
following considerations? These questions occupy this pa-
per’s remainder.  
McDowell deploys the rule-following considerations to 
dislodge a prejudice about rational consistency, which mo-
tivates the view that morality is codifiable. The prejudice is 
that applying a certain (moral) concept consistently across 
different cases requires that what counts as doing the 
same thing is “fixed by rules” (McDowell 1981, 145), or, as 
he puts it elsewhere, that virtue “must be explicable in 
terms of being guided by a formulable universal principle” 
(1998, 58).  
This conception of the moral domain has “two interlock-
ing components”. First, a conception of moral principles as 
“objectively there to be followed” from “a standpoint inde-
pendent of all the human activities and reactions” in which 
those practices are embedded. Second, the claim that be-
ing a competent moral judge is like possessing a “psycho-
logical mechanism” which reliably “churns out the appro-
priate behavior”. This platonic-mechanical picture is moti-
vated by a felt need to secure “keep our practices in line,” 
to secure moral thought from its ‘mere’ dependence on our 
shared ‘form of life’ (McDowell 1998). McDowell believes – 
rightly, I think – all this is profoundly mistaken.  
The important question, however, is what a rejection of 
this quite specific picture of moral virtue shows. McDowell 
oscillates between two different conclusions. I will discuss 
the stronger of these first. On the stronger reading, 
McDowell suggests that these reflections imply that princi-
ples are superfluous in moral practice: “occasion by occa-
sion, one knows what to do, if one does, not by applying 
universal principles but by being a certain kind of person: 
one who sees situations in a certain distinctive way” 
(McDowell 1998, 73). (This reading of McDowell is sug-
gested by O’Neill (1996, 77-88)).  
This conclusion, however, does not follow from the rule-
following considerations. To see why, let us consider those 
considerations in more detail.

2. Revisiting Rule-Following  
We are all, by now, familiar with the parable of the ‘deviant 
pupil’ (§185, subsequent citations from Philosophical In-
vestigations, unless otherwise indicated). When given the 
order ‘add 2,’ the pupil continues as we would up to 1,000, 
and, by all normal criteria, appears to have mastered the 
technique. Then, she continues - 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012 
– insisting stubbornly she is going on in the same way as 
before.  
This familiar story is supposed to teach us something. 
But, what? A proper appreciation of the lesson depends on 
an account of Wittgenstein’s target is. One common early 
response begins with the disquietude the parable pro-
vokes: if there is nothing in the pupil’s behavior that rules 
out her way of continuing the series, there may be no crite-
ria of correctness here. Kripke’s skeptic, for example, in-
sists that there is no fact which corresponds to our having 
meant the order in one way or another. Michael Dummett 
insists that each step requires a new decision to take the 
rule in a particular way.  
Both readings support skepticism about the place of 
principles in moral theory. For Kripke’s skeptic, accord with 
a moral principle amounts to nothing. As Wittgenstein puts 
it, “if every course of action can be brought into accord with 
the rule, then it can also be brought into conflict with it. 
And so there would be neither accord nor conflict here” 
(§201). On Dummett’s conventionalist reading, principles 
are superfluous because particular decisions reign king.  
However, these readings stop too soon. Wittgenstein’s 
aim is not to shake our confidence that we follow rules. He 
aims instead to call into question the apparent groundless-
ness of our practices by calling into question metaphysical 
demand his interlocutor places on what a ground must be. 
The idea in question is that “how one means a rule is go-
ing to give you some notion of unconditioned determina-
tion of the correct continuation” (Goldfarb 2012). Thus, it is 
not following a rule itself but a certain conception of it that 
Wittgenstein targets. (Consider, e.g., §195. The interlocu-
tor exclaims: “But I don’t mean that what I do now (in 
grasping the whole use of a word) determines the future 
use causally…but that, in a strange way, the use itself is in 
some sense present”. The narrator retorts: “but of course it 
is, ‘in some sense!’ Really, the only thing wrong with what 
you say is the expression ‘in an odd way’. The rest is 
right”).  
One aspect of the problematic conception is the idea 
that being guided by a rule requires some mental item to 
be present, which one can consult when responding to 
particular utterances, an item which will tell you unequivo-
cally how to proceed. Wittgenstein demonstrates the idle-
ness of this conception relentlessly “showing that whatever 
might be thought to accompany the use of a sound or 
mark would be nothing better than another ‘dead’ mark or 
object or event” (Stroud 2000, 173).  A second aspect is 
the idea that the connection between a rule and its appli-
cation is ‘objectively there’ – in a queer way - fully inde-
pendent of the practices in which it is operative. A correct 
continuation of a series is not somehow platonically con-
tained within the rule for its continuation, independent of 
our practices of being “taught to use it” in a certain way 
(§190), nor is knowing how to go on a definite mental 
state, like having run through the extension of the series in 
one’s head (§194). 
In short, Wittgenstein targets not rule-following, but a 
particular philosophical (mis)conception of it. To dispel 
these confusions, Wittgenstein reminds us, in drum-beat 
fashion (§198-202), that following a rule (or meaning a 
word) is a practices or custom. I will leave aside the thorny 
issue of what this appeal to practice is supposed to show, 
and turn again to McDowell’s argument.  
3. Rejecting McDowell’s Strong Conclusion  
Recall that McDowell’s argument targets a certain platonic-
mechanical conception of what it is for the moral domain is 
to be codified in principles. We ought to reject this picture, 
and indeed the rule-following considerations suggest as 
much. However, rejecting that moral principles can be 
codified in that way does not imply that principles play no 
important role in moral life  Just as Wittgenstein attacks 
only a particular conception of rule-following, the applica-
tion of this argument to ethics can only undermine a par-
ticular account of how moral principles are supposed to 
work. 
The strong conclusion that principles are superfluous re-
quires the additional assumption that moral philosophers 
are committed to conceiving of moral principles according 
to the contested conception. But, this is not so. Principles 
need not be thought of as rigid stringent, decisive or self-
interpreting. Moral philosophers should acknowledge that 
following should not be understood as mechanical or un-
duly mental, and that being competent with moral princi-
ples requires judgment and skill. There are much humbler 
accounts of moral principles to be had. Moral principles 
can be thought of like other general reasons, in that they 
point our attention to salient features of situations that 
have moral relevance. Principles can be understood as 
partial articulations of the attitudes, practices, and con-
cerns of human agents or communities, arrived at through 
reflective interrogation of our considered judgments. More-
over, as pragmatists acknowledge, principles provide no 
guarantee: they are revisable commitments. A general 
ranking of principles is a philosopher’s chimera.   
This modest take on principles is compatible with the 
claim that principles play useful roles in moral theory and 
practice. The principle ‘do not make lying promises’ (e.g.) 
can inform deliberation, even if it requires judgment in its 
application or can be overruled by other principles. An ac-
count of what counts as informed consent can guide medi-
cal policy and practice, even if hard cases will remain. 
Ethical theory can inform moral practice, even if moral 
principles underdetermine action.   
In short, rejecting a particular conception of principles 
does not entail that principles cannot guide action in a per-
fectly ordinary sense. That rejection of the platonic picture 
should prompt, not the banishment of principles from moral 
theory, but a sustained reconsideration of how principles 
function in moral practice.  
4. Endorsing a Weaker Conclusion 
Perhaps the strong conclusion discussed above is not 
what McDowell has in mind. A weaker reading of McDow-
ell’s conclusion is possible: perhaps McDowell, like Witt-
genstein, is simply targeting a felt philosophical necessity. 
On this reading, McDowell does not deny that some moral 
generalizations are codifiable in principles, but only that 
the totality of a moral outlook is so codifiable. His target is 
a modal claim: that ethical conduct “must be explicable in 
terms of being guided by a formulable universal principle” 
(McDowell 1998, 58). Interpreted thusly, McDowell is 
merely suggesting that ethical conduct need not be 
thought of in this way.  

McDowell on Rule-Following and Moral Principles | Daniel Sharp 
 
 
 
257
This modest conclusion has some connection to Witt-
genstein’s remarks on rules earlier in Philosophical Inves-
tigations. It is connected to the thought that, although we 
can in certain circumstances compare language to a calcu-
lus with fixed rules, this picture can often be deeply mis-
leading when too liberally or interpreted too stringently 
(§81). Moreover, it is connected to Wittgenstein’s insis-
tence that “a game is not everywhere bounded by rules” 
(§68). Wittgenstein continues that remark as follows: 
“[the use of the word ‘game’] is not everywhere 
bounded by rules; but no more are there any rules for 
how high to throw the ball in tennis, or how hard, yet 
tennis is a game for all that, and has rules too” (Ibid).  
Wittgenstein’s point here is to show the emptiness of the 
philosophical demand that rules must be everywhere per-
vasive. But, this does not entail that our practices cannot 
be partially codified and articulated, just that we should not 
measure ‘codification’ by the standards of a fantastical 
ideal of completeness. Rules can be constitutive, yet in-
complete; important, yet limited. 
This conclusion is surely right. Virtuous conduct does not 
require guidance by moral principles, any more than con-
tinuing a series correctly requires guidance by the formula 
‘add 2’. But, this, again, does not imply a rejection of prin-
ciples as superfluous or unhelpful. Accepting McDowell 
point does suggest that philosophers should be more at-
tuned to other phenomena, such as (perhaps) the capacity 
for sensitivity to the particular situation. Philosophers 
should indeed look more carefully at moral practice, rather 
than assuming at the outset in must be a matter of princi-
ple. Again, however, accepting this thesis is compatible 
with the idea that moral principles can serve as guides and 
standards and that part of what moral philosophy ought to 
do is specify plausible moral principles that can be useful 
in particular situations.  
5. Conclusion 
I have argued that the rule-following considerations have 
only considerably more modest implications for moral phi-
losophers than is often thought. Although the treatment of 
these issues has remained schematic, I hope it is sufficient 
to show that those moved by Wittgenstein’s remarks on 
rules need not reject moral principles wholesale. Rather, 
attention to the rule-following considerations should en-
courage reexamination of the (limited though) important, 
role such principles (can) play in moral practice.

(Non)cognitive Aspects of the Notebook: Extended Cognition and 
Practice of Use 
Michal Sládeček 
Belgrade, Serbia | sladecek007@hotmail.com 
Abstract 
In the first part of the article the basic characteristics of the hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) are briefly sketched, as well 
as some problems and objections to this hypothesis. The second part points to affiliations between the hypothesis and 
Wittgenstein's approach to problems of mind. According to the argumentation presented here, Wittgenstein's position leads to 
the claim that there are cases in which an external object, along with activity of the organism, are necessary elements for the 
fulfilment of a cognitive task. Also, Wittgenstein's approach can be helpful as a response to objections to HEC concerning the 
scope of the cases which can be marked as extended cognition. This approach proceeds from activity, practice of use or 
acquired technique as the main basis for the determination of the characteristics and the criteria of external cognition. 
 
 
Apart from the direct and indirect influence of Wittgen-
stein's philosophy in discussions concerning the hypothe-
sis of extended cognition (HEC, hereafter), Wittgenstein is 
not often invoked as the founding father of this concept. 
However, there are pioneering attempts to elucidate this 
connection and authors such as Susswein and Racine re-
fer to two Wittgensteinian themes which have crucial rele-
vance to HEC: “(1) Some degree of opposition to the 
identiﬁcation of cognition with representation; and (2) An 
apprehension of the metaphorical nature of conceiving of 
mind as inner" (Susswein and Racine 2009: 185). My in-
tention is to add one more Wittgensteinian theme: (3) the 
condition of cognition is an externally learned technique, 
activity or practice, and, accordingly, the environment can 
be treated as part of cognition when integrated with an in-
ternal vehicle through practice of use. In the second part of 
the text I will try to sketch the meaning of this third theme 
and its relevance to HEC. 
The representative text, which encompasses the numer-
ous virtues and vices of HEC and from which stem most of 
the polemics regarding its problems, is Clark and 
Chalmers' article “The Extended Mind”, which has often 
been reprinted, quoted and criticized. The text begins with 
the question fundamental to HEC: “Where does the mind 
stop and rest of the world begin?” Since the authors de-
fend a stance of active externalism based on the active 
role of environment in the functioning of cognitive proc-
esses (Clark & Chalmers 1998: 220), they repudiate the 
thesis that the brain or skull is the border where the mind 
stops.  
Justification of HEC is illustrated in Clarke and Chalmers' 
example of Inga and Otto, who use different means in or-
der to achieve corresponding cognitive results – belief in 
location of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA, hereafter), 
and accordingly, accomplishing the action of visiting mu-
seum. Inga is the person with normal memory – she heard 
about the new museum exhibition and decided to visit it. 
She is unsure of the location at first, but calling to mind 
that museum is located on 53rd street, Lexington Avenue, 
she decides to go to the recalled place. She had “con-
sulted” her memory and it could be said that her belief in 
where museum is located is in some way encoded or 
stored in her mind. On the other hand, Otto is suffering 
from Alzheimer’s disease and is compelled to rely on ex-
ternal means which have the function of memory. He has 
also heard that the new exhibition in MOMA has opened 
and he has decided to visit it. But to discover where mu-
seum is located he must consult the notebook which he 
always carries with him. Hence, he looks at the notebook, 
spots the note that MOMA is in 53
rd street and decides to 
go to the museum. In this case, the notebook has the 
same function as Inga's memory. As Inga had a belief 
about where museum was before she “consulted” her 
memory, in the same vein Otto had a corresponding be-
liefs before he consulted the notebook. Hence, information 
in the notebook has the same function as information in 
the memory – the fact that in the first case information is in 
an organism, and in the second case on paper is quite 
contingent. 
The radical conclusion drawn by Clark and Chalmers is 
that beliefs, and consequently the mind itself, are not 
(only) in the head. Mental processes do not take places 
exclusively in the domain of the neural system, and objects 
in the external world are integral parts of cognition in as far 
as objects contribute to cognition. In as much as non-
mental processes have the same or similar functions as 
mental processes and are integrated with or connected 
causally to internal cognitive processes (and, in this way, 
are coupled with them), the former processes can be 
marked as cognitive regardless of their extracranial loca-
tion. 
HEC has been the subject of numerous critiques among 
which two objections relate to this occasion in particular:  
1. The parity principle. According to earlier versions of 
HEC, which were occasionally espoused by Clark and 
Chalmers, external processes can be taken as cognitive in 
far as they are isomorphic with internal processes – that is 
to say if their functions corresponds in a relevant manner. 
Otto's notes have an equal function similar to Inga's bio-
logical memory and lead to the same behavior. This so-
called parity principle leads Clark and Chalmers to the 
conclusion that, if there are relevant similarities between 
external and internal processes, the former ones have 
equal rights to be marked as cognitive (Clark & Chalmers 
1998: 222). 
Critics of HEC do not contest the assumption that Otto's 
notes and Inga's memories have an equal functional role. 
The recollection of memories can control a person's ac-
tions and influence their intentions in the same manner as 
reading the notes. However, their qualities are utterly dif-
ferent: while notes are an example of a static medium and 
their function depends on receptive processes of the sub-
ject who is in contact with them, biological memory is a 
dynamic system which goes through modifications and 
reorganizations. The parts of the neural system and causal

connections responsible for the cognitive processes as 
characteristics of biological memory do not exists in the 
notebooks. Therefore, notes are quite distinct from mem-
ory and cannot be at any rate considered as cognition. 
One of the HEC defence strategies is to emphasize the 
functional similarities of external and internal vehicles apart 
from their structural differences. In practice functioning of 
internal and external vehicles share the same characteris-
tics – for example, Otto could lose his notebook, but Inga 
could be intoxicated and suffer from loss of memory con-
cerning the location of MOMA. Nevertheless, arguments 
based on parallelism, isomorphism or similarity of function-
ing lead to some unacceptable corollaries concerning the 
identity of mental and non-mental processes, which mean 
the overlooking and trivializing of their intrinsic qualities. 
Also, HEC tends to abolish the common-sense distinction 
between the subject with his or her mental capacities and 
intentional stances (senses, perception, feelings, memory, 
understanding etc.) and objects which do not hold any of 
these stances. The conclusions of HEC are utterly linguis-
tically counter-intuitive. 
Many adherents of HEC assume that the parity principle 
can be abandoned and the core of HEC can be saved at 
the same time. Functional parity as the basis of extended 
mind argument in recent theories is superseded by the 
model of cognitive integration (Menary 2006), the comple-
mentarity of external and internal vehicles of cognition 
(Sutton 2010), or the hybrid mind (Rowlands 2010). Con-
ceived in this way, HEC could allow that the functioning of 
vehicles is different, although the most relevant is the inte-
gration of internal and external vehicles in the cognitive 
unit, which means that their different functions are com-
plementary in the way they are convenient for accom-
plishment of a particular cognitive task. 
2. The coupling argument. Proponents of HEC consider 
cognitive processes as constituted by the interaction of 
external and internal vehicles. Therefore, when external 
vehicles become the object of manipulation by the internal, 
they become an integral part of cognition. Critics of HEC 
assume, nevertheless, that corollary of this kind of expla-
nation is the coupling-constitution fallacy, which fails to 
notice that coupling is distinct from constitution and intrin-
sic nature of an external object is not transformed to cogni-
tive just by having influence on a subject or causing inten-
tional stances. It should be reckoned that in interaction the 
distinction between the active agent and the object of ma-
nipulation has been retained, which has not been ac-
knowledged in HEC. Moreover, HEC tends to the conclu-
sion that cognition occurs every time one uses the phone 
book, turns on computer or asks random person for infor-
mation (Adams and Aizawa 2001: 60). Nevertheless, com-
puter and phone book are mere objects which cause par-
ticular beliefs and influence processes of learning, remem-
bering, concluding etc. Data obtained from the internet 
cause the forming of a particular judgement about a sub-
ject, but neither the data, nor the web itself are cognition. 
Regarding the objection to overlooking the distinction be-
tween mental and physical processes, it can be said that 
retaining the distinction does not instigate crucial difficul-
ties for the hypothesis. Namely, it is not contradictory to 
claim that the intrinsic qualities of internal and external ve-
hicles are different and that those vehicles can be consid-
ered as an integral system. The initial aim of the HEC is 
neither to nullify this distinction, nor to proclaim every cou-
pled object “cognitive”. Adherents of the hypothesis state 
only that, once coupled in an appropriate way, the object 
from the non-cognitive stance becomes part of the cogni-
tive. Coupling should not be conceived of as a mechanical 
merging of the mental and physical – extended cognition is 
the complex intertwined connexion in which neither inter-
nal, nor external factors by themselves are functional in the 
sense of achieving cognitive aims (e.g. obtaining belief, 
resolving a complex arithmetical problems, retrieving 
memory).  
Apart of this, coupling argument conceals an additional 
difficulty in extended cognition hypothesis. If too many en-
tities, coupled with an internal vehicle, are part of the cog-
nitive process, then cognition would encompass not only 
anything which is the object of manipulation, but also any 
object which, in way or another, affects our thoughts, even 
if only potentially (e.g. the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the 
shelf or web pages on the internet). Adams and Azawa 
characterize this excessiveness as “pancognitivism”, “the 
problem of cognitive bloat” or “cognitive ooze” (Adams and 
Aizawa 2001: 57), in which all objects are virtually cogni-
tive, while myriads of them are actually cognitive by their 
very interaction with reasoning subjects. According to Ad-
ams and Azawa, Clark and Chalmers did not offer any dis-
criminating mark of integrated cognition which would de-
termine which process or what kind of object should be 
marked as extending the boundaries of the processes of 
internal medium.  
Following Wittgenstein, it can be assumed that in certain 
cases the occurrence of a particular external object is a 
necessary condition for cognition. In Remarks on the Phi-
losophy of Psychology, I § 908, and Zettel § 612 Wittgen-
stein presents one of those cases: The person is taking 
note that somebody dictates to her. She has paper and 
pencil and while she listens to what somebody recite she is 
making marks on the paper. To reproduce heard words, 
she has to follow those marks with her eyes. But we can 
assume that those marks are just jottings, not writing, and 
they are not by any rule connected with a language or any 
symbols. Anyway, she is not capable of repeating dictated 
text without following her jottings. If they are destroyed or 
modified, she will be stuck in reproducing them, or finding 
the appropriate word. Jottings would be neither a text, nor 
a translation to another symbolism. If the text is not stored 
in jottings as a representation of recitation, it would not be 
stored in the nervous system as well.  
In this example Wittgenstein's emphasis is on the sub-
ject's inability to reproduce text without “nonsensical” jot-
tings. Brain activity, eye movement and jottings – the brain, 
the organism, and the non-biological objects – are insepa-
rable parts of solving cognitive tasks. In the same vein, we 
can imagine the case in which a person can compute only 
by using paper and pencil, not being able to perform cer-
tain mathematical operations “in the head”. This does not 
mean that she cannot count internally at all, rather, at a 
certain point she must use objects in order to bring about a 
result. Internal process are not (and they cannot be) elimi-
nated, and they remain an indispensable part of extended 
cognition with its inherent performances, but in this case 
internal act is not sufficient to achieve a particular cognitive 
task. Despite of the inexorability of the mental medium and 
the fact that internal cognition is self-sufficient in perform-
ing certain actions, there are cases in which cognition 
needs extension. Therefore, in those cases external ob-
jects are not merely props or bare stimuli. Without them 
cognition would not be complete, as is the case of the jot-
tings drawn by the person in Wittgenstein's example, be-
cause, in the absence of them, retrieval of memory would 
not emerge: without the object, brain processes could not 
achieve the given task. 
As has been noticed, one of the main objections to HEC 
was that it implies an all-inclusive mind, which means this

hypothesis widens the extension of the concept of the 
cognitive system to all interactions between internal and 
external vehicles. Let us presuppose that Otto was not 
looking at the notebook, or forgot to do so, but something 
else reminded him about the location of MOMA – for ex-
ample, he was counting playing cards and counted the 
joker as 53
rd card, or someone on the radio mentioned 
Lexington Avenue. It would be absurd to claim that the 
cards, the radio or the speaker are part of Otto's cognitive 
system as extensions of his mental capacity. Allowing this 
we are falling into a situation in which everything can be 
fitted to memory, and can be counted as part of the cogni-
tive system.  
Clark and Chalmers would agree that the notes in the 
notebook are parts of the cognitive system, but some other 
cases which arouse memory, such as an accidental en-
counter with a number, a person, or a similar name, are 
not. According to them, the external processes and objects 
could be considered as part of the cognitive system de-
pending on their reliability, availability and the possibility of 
automatic endorsement. However, those criteria are in 
need of elaboration and justification in extenso and the 
impression is that one of the crucial question concerning 
HEC has been neglected. Again, a Wittgensteinian stance 
might be helpful. According to Wittgenstein, the inner cog-
nitive activity is in need of external processes in the sense 
that a person can calculate inwardly only if she has 
learned what “to calculate” is (Wittgenstein 1967, II, xii, 
220). Through practice of use external objects are inter-
connected with internal mental processes and this connec-
tion allows us to delineate the scope of extended cogni-
tion. This use or technique differentiates extended cogni-
tion from accidental evocation (say, by association) in 
which no skills or competences are required. To illustrate 
this more clearly, let us presuppose that a “notebook” 
means not a sheets of paper, but a laptop. The laptop be-
comes part of extended cognition only when Otto masters 
particular operations, such as starting the operational sys-
tem, opening the programme, finding the right folder and 
file etc. Evidently, acquiring the skills are essential for Otto 
to retrieve memory through an external medium. He has to 
learn and practice using the notebook before the content 
of memory becomes available, reliable, durable and auto-
matically retrievable, which imply that the abovementioned 
criteria for extended cognition are internally connected with 
training and acquiring skills and depend on this learnt 
practice. More basic than the conditions for extended cog-
nition proposed by Clarke and Chalmers are mode and 
procedure through which internal vehicle and external ob-
ject are in interaction. In conclusion, it can be said that, 
although not removing all difficulties concerning extended 
cognition, this position can be a fruitful attempt to avoid a 
pre-wittgensteinian conception of mind as a self-contained 
substance, as well as the pancognitivism of an amalga-
mated identity of internal and external vehicles.

Meaning: Hermeneutical, Theoretical, and Practical 
Maja Soboleva 
Klagenfurt, Austria | Mayya.Soboleva@aau.at 
Abstract 
The question this article is what kind of hermeneutics can emerge on the basis of a philosophy of life. To answer it, the theories 
of the German philosophers Georg Misch (1878-1965) and Josef König (1893-1974) have been analysed. The first developed a 
“hermeneutical logic”, which is based on the identification of the notions “life” and “articulation” (Ausdruck). Three aspects – life 
as a logical category, life as a hermeneutical category, and the discursive forms of self-representation of life – extracted from 
Misch’s theory seem to be relevant for the further development of hermeneutics. König carries forward this research program, 
but focuses on the linguistic structures of human perceptual experience and drafts a kind of analytical hermeneutics. The 
remarkable part of both conceptions is that they posit logical heterogeneity of theoretical and practical discourses. These 
differences are relevant for the rethinking of such epistemological phenomena as “meaning”, “concept”, “truth” and “knowledge”. 
According to these positions, hermeneutics can’t be a homogeneous theory of interpretation or understanding, but, on the 
contrary, the different logical areas of hermeneutic analysis must be analysed. A vital contribution of these theories to the 
hermeneutic theory is that a discourse analysis doesn’t challenge the hermeneutic method as centred on meaning-making but 
completes it. They introduce the hermeneutic concept of knowledge as signifying practises of meaning-production that make the 
analysis of meaning a key method for a general theory of knowledge. Thus, hermeneutics can be interpreted as an alternative to 
the traditional, i.e. epistemological approach to the theory of knowledge. 
 
 
Throughout the 20th Century, West European and Ameri-
can philosophy focused closely on the analysis of mean-
ing. Among different theories of meaning the analytical and 
hermeneutical approach is traditionally differentiated. 
However, it is misleading to speak of the analytical or her-
meneutical theory of meaning in the singular; these names 
refer to a wide range of thinkers and theories in a number 
of systematic and historical contexts. One problem re-
searchers are facing is that there is very little guidance on 
what exactly constitutes a hermeneutic method. The term 
“hermeneutics” can hardly be said to have a well-defined 
place in the philosophical vocabulary. It is often - espe-
cially in analytical philosophy - understood as just meaning 
exegetical works on written or oral texts or as a discipline 
generally dealing with speaking (in a broad sense) and 
linguistic understanding and interpretation. But if we think 
of the hermeneutics of Dilthey, Heidegger or Gadamer, 
then hermeneutics appears to be more than just the sci-
ence about intersubjective understanding and communica-
tion. In all these cases “hermeneutics” designates an al-
ternative to the traditional, i.e. epistemological, approach 
to the theory of knowledge. With my paper I aim to investi-
gate the specificity of the hermeneutical theory of knowl-
edge. Apart from that, I also focus on the theoretical ques-
tion concerning the general philosophical understanding of 
the hermeneutical method. In my argumentation, I refer to 
two hermeneutical theories that are still rather unknown, 
those of Georg Misch (1878-1965) and Josef König (1893-
1974) who represent Dilthey’s school of philosophy.  
With his theory named “hermeneutical logic”, Georg 
Misch tried to give a foundation for the humane sciences. 
In fact, the result of his philosophical endeavour is a gen-
eral theory of knowledge which is based on a hermeneuti-
cal theory of meaning. The background for it was provided 
by Dilthey’s philosophy of life. The notion of life should be-
come, according to Misch, the key notion of philosophical 
thought. It should take the place of the notion “being” that 
has been traditionally regarded as a privileged object of 
philosophical reflexion (Misch 1967: 4).  
What advantages can be achieved for philosophy in 
general and for hermeneutics in particular by prioritising 
the notion “life”? Misch understands life neither from the 
Aristotelian biological perspective on living things, nor in 
the sense of metaphysical irrationalism as a vital sub-
stance of the meaningful. He identifies “life” with “articula-
tion” (Ausdruck). Therefore life begins for him where this 
kind of activity can be registered and culminates in human 
discursive thinking. Misch’s category “articulation of life” 
allows to observe the logic of the unfolding the meaningful 
activity including the primary awareness of the subject’s 
own acting and its environment, the worldview, and theo-
retical constructions. The term “life” means, hence, firstly, 
a special logical category.  
Different logical forms of articulation of life correlate in 
Misch’s theory with different forms of meaning (Bedeu-
tung). The term “meaning” must be primarily apprehended 
as a “real” category of life (not of semantics) which struc-
tures the living beings’ activity. On the other hand, life ap-
pears as a set of different kinds of meaning that embraces 
such levels as a non-discursive meaning (symbol), linguis-
tic meaning (word), and a meaning as theoretical concept 
(term). It stretches top-down beyond the limits of human 
life towards animal life. In this way, the “hermeneutical 
logic” transforms the notion “life” into a hermeneutical 
category.  
Differentiating these forms of meaning, I argue that the 
phenomenon “life” appears as a correlative set of multiple 
forms of knowledge reflecting different forms of rationality. 
Thus, knowledge is irreducible just to the scientific knowl-
edge. Knowledge must be seen as a universal attribute of 
life. Specifically for human beings, knowledge is rather the 
series of verbal “objectivations” which can be interpreted 
as the forms of self-representation of life. According to 
Misch, the self-representation of life can be traced back to 
two kinds of discourse: the “pure discursive” and the 
“evocative” discourse. The field of discursivity is, therefore, 
heterogenic, and demands selective analysis of its parts. 
In my view, this hermeneutical idea challenges the modern 
analytical philosophy of language. The latter concentrates 
mostly on the analysis of propositions that are based on 
the logical calculus such as juxtaposition, inference, impli-
cation, etc. This means, it acts within a “space of reasons” 
(in Brandom’s terms). Misch’s main attention belongs 
however to the “evocative” utterances. Their logic can be 
characterized as non-predicative because they are based 
on intuition, metaphor, etc. (for example, in the case of

nomination). This shifting of accents is caused by his wish 
to explain how the human form of life, in his terms the 
“world of the word”, come into existence.  
The assumption about the logical heterogeneity of the 
hermeneutical discourse implies that the “pure discursive” 
and the “evocative” discourses have different logical foun-
dations. In fact, the “pure discursive” utterances are based 
upon conceptual content. In contrast, the conceptual char-
acter of the “evocative” utterances originates from the in-
tentionality of language, i.e. it just has a representational 
content. These differences in conceptual constitution of 
“pure discursive” and “evocative” utterances can be 
founded in different forms of action. Thus, the “evocative” 
utterance reflects creative hermeneutic productivity of hu-
manities, while the “discursive” utterance is connected with 
the activity directed towards the analysis of existent phe-
nomena. The “discursive” concepts are connected with 
theoretical reflection. The “evocative” concepts or, in terms 
of Misch, the “hermeneutical constructions” (“herme-
neutische Gestaltungen”) are the products of the immedi-
ate articulation of emotional and cultural experience incor-
porated in the cognitive activity. Therefore the lived expe-
rience (Erlebnis) as a unity of action and the knowledge of 
this action should be accepted as the necessary premise 
of the possibility of this kind of articulation. Being a unity of 
action and reflexion, human life can expresses itself in dis-
cursive form. This discursive form is however not a product 
of theoretical reflection, but a non-theoretical reflection 
which is incorporated in a process of life.  
 I summarise. Misch’s “hermeneutical logic” delivers a re-
constructive phenomenology of knowledge that focuses on 
the hermeneutical notion “life” and covers a broad range of 
topics dealing with the mechanisms of awareness of the 
world, the connections between logic of articulation and 
the form of meaning, and between conceptualisation and 
action.  
When Misch’s student and friend König refrains from the 
notion “life” and returns to the notion “being” (in his book 
“Being and Thinking” (“Sein und Denken”) (1937) and his 
later papers and lectures), it seems to be, at first glance, a 
retreat to metaphysics. In reality, he continues research 
into the constitutive and representative structures of a life 
focusing on the human life. In contrast to his professor, he 
concentrates on the structure of human perceptual experi-
ence (at the beginning of his carrier) and expresses it in 
terms of “determining” and “modifying” predicates. Later, 
he devotes himself to the analysis of two types of sen-
tences that he names “theoretical” and “practical” sen-
tences. In so doing, he creates his own alternative non-
analytical “speech act theory”, the main theses of which 
were already formulated in 1948.  
Revealing the structure of human cognitive experience, 
König’s “determining” predicates refer to the things that 
can be sensually perceived, and register their properties. 
The “modifying” predicates constitute the mental things by 
means of interpretation of the special “sense of being” 
(“das Gefühl des Seins”). The notion “sense of being” de-
scribes the way in which the term refers to its immaterial 
object by means of establishing essential properties. By 
differentiating between “determining” and “modifying” pred-
icates, König – different than, for example, McDowell – 
transforms Kant’s theory of experiences based on the pos-
tulate that “concepts without percepts are empty; percepts 
without concepts are blind”. According to him, this rule 
should be reserved only for the “determining” predicates 
that stand for perceivable objects. For the “modifying” 
predicates, only language and the “self-differentiating” of 
reason into “sense of being” and “self-reasoning reason” 
are necessary. The “modifying” predicates will not be con-
stituted because of perception and predication, but by 
means of metaphoric explication in the process of self-
interpretation of the perceptive-spontaneous reason, 
whereupon the logical grammar of the metaphor is to be 
stretched beyond the linguistic metaphor toward the non-
linguistic.  
Two kinds of being correspond with the “determining” 
and “modifying” predicates. They are nature (in a broad 
sense of the word) and the intersubjective symbolic human 
world of meaning. “Being” turns out to be in König’s con-
ception just the material and formal things that exist. To 
obtain the concept of nature, predicative thinking and sen-
sations are relevant; and to obtain the concept of the world 
of meaning the “thinking in accusative”, i.e. the non-
discursive thinking, and the explication of the “self-
differentiating” reason are constitutive. In contrast to the 
contemporary discussion of perceptual experience, the 
question whether the content of experience is conceptual 
or non-conceptual is not a core issue for this theory; rather 
it is a question on the different “logical morphology” of 
conceptual experience that must be exposed.  
König’s theory of “theoretical” and “practical” sentences, 
first formulated in 1947, includes an analysis of scientific 
and non-scientific sentences. It is an attempt – after Bren-
tano and before Thompson – to challenge the Aristotelian 
analysis of apophantic statements. This is not the place to 
engage in substantive discussion and critique of the indi-
vidual arguments. Nevertheless, some particular aspects 
must be pointed out. König argues that the apophantic 
sentences are inhomogeneous, and differentiates between 
practical and theoretical apophanses. The “theoretical sen-
tence” is a proposition. The “practical sentence” is “an ac-
tion in the form of a sentence” (König 2005: 23). According 
to this definition, the practical apophantic sentence is an 
act of informing (Mitteilung). “Informing” as an action has a 
normative character: it implicates the “practical” knowledge 
of what is informed about. One can’t inform about anything 
that one doesn’t know. On the contrary, a real content of 
the “theoretical sentence” does not concern its subject, but 
the sentential function. Thus the Aristotelian sentence “S is 
(has, does) P” must be read – using König’s transformation 
based on Russell’s and Frege’s logical investigations – as 
“For every X is valid: when X is S, then XP”. According to 
König, the real logical content of this sentence is an impli-
cation. The truth-value of this judgment doesn’t depend on 
the judgment “There is (are) X”. The differences in the 
logical structure of the theoretical and practical apo-
phanses determine the differences regarding their truth. 
Thus, König argues that the “practical sentence” itself is 
neither true nor false but its truth value depends, first, on 
its concrete usage, and, secondly, it depends on pragmatic 
factors, i.e. the intention of the speaker to tell the truth or 
to lie. In contrast to it, the “theoretical sentence” is a sen-
tence “in itself”, and therefore its definite content is always 
either true or false.  
Thus, the apophantic statements consist of two inc-
ommensurable types: the “practical sentence” as the ac-
tion of informing and the “theoretical sentence” as a 
proposition. This “cardinal” difference evokes the differ-
ences in semantics of such related epistemological terms 
as “being”, “truth”, and “knowledge”. The “practical being” 
can be defined as a set of intersubjective accepted beliefs; 
the “theoretical being” is rather a correlate of veritable 
propositions. If, theoretically, the term “truth” implicates 
correspondence between proposition and reality, the 
“practical truth”, however, would be mere consensus. 
While in the theoretical sphere one must differentiate be-
tween “knowledge” and “meaning”, in the practical sphere,

263
on the contrary, these terms are identical (this can be seen 
as an alternative to Gettier’s interpretation of the definition 
of knowledge). Thus, if hermeneutics is generally defined 
as a theory of understanding, König’s theory demands that 
the topoi of the notion in question must be specified con-
cerning the constitution of their meaning in order to 
achieve its proper understanding.  
I conclude that Misch and König are authors who pro-
pose rethinking our conception of hermeneutics in the light 
of the challenges that the hermeneutical notion of life – the 
case Misch’s – and the hermeneutical notion of “being” – 
the case König’s – introduce. They introduce the herme-
neutic concept of knowledge as signifying practises of 
meaning-production that make the analysis of meaning a 
key method for a general theory of knowledge. Their works 
gives us the possibility of discovering the latent analytic 
nature of hermeneutical philosophy. The differentiating two 
spheres of discourses – the theoretical and the practical –, 
which are constituted by the different logical forms of act-
ing and thinking, can be fruitfully used to further modernise 
the hermeneutical methodology.  
Within the framework established with the help of these 
German philosophers, the so-called propositionalism as a 
main principle of hermeneutics appears to be problematic. 
An alternative approach goes back to Dilthey, who resisted 
scientific or propositional patterns as the only possible ex-
planation of meaning and stressed the role of immediate 
“objectivation” without intellectualization and ratiocination 
in Husserl’s and Frege’s sense. For the formulation of an 
alternative to propositional theories of meaning, the meth-
odological frame of Misch’s general theory of knowledge in 
the form of the “hermeneutical logic” is relevant because of 
its focus on the “articulation”. According to it, productive, 
explicative articulation, but not predication can be seen as 
a primarily process of understanding the world that results 
in concept formation. Josef König’s initial theory exposes 
some mechanisms of production of the meaning for the 
qualitatively different types of experiences. It shows that a 
two-valued attributive propositional logic is not legislative 
for all areas of experience. It can be reserved primary for 
explaining how the concepts for the sensually perceivable 
objects can be constructed. To apprehend how the con-
cepts of ideal objects are generated, another form of logic 
that arises out of the specific hermeneutical theory of met-
aphor must be taken into consideration. Thus, the herme-
neutical approach assesses that there are two kinds of 
logical constructions of the meaning: one is responsible for 
the language operating indexically, and another deals with 
symbolical language (but not in the sense of Peirce). The 
latter expresses our impression of perception of the world. 
The logic of this symbolical language - represented with 
Misch’s “evocative” discourse and König’s “modifying” 
predicates and “practical sentences” – goes beyond the 
inferential semantic and receives its foundations in the 
transcendental pragmatics. Both authors share the intui-
tion that logical justification must be completed with prag-
matic. In fact, a theory of meaning that restricted itself to 
deductive procedures would be radically incomplete. It 
would exclude from the scope of knowledge the whole 
range of meaningful relationships, structural influences of 
social action, and the interpretative activity of human be-
ings. A vital contribution of Misch and König to the herme-
neutic theory is that a discourse analysis doesn’t challenge 
the hermeneutic method as centred on meaning-making 
but completes it.  
The analyzed theories demonstrate that the anti-
scientific and anti-theoretical stance that is inherent to 
philosophical hermeneutics taken as a whole do not pre-
vent hermeneutics from becoming more analytical. They 
are a fascinating resource for rethinking the conceptualiza-
tion of meaning that promotes hermeneutical theory and 
give it a new turn. An updated hermeneutics offers a better 
basis for the theory of knowledge, shaping the focus on 
interplays between meaning, world and subject.

„Denk nicht, sondern schau“ – Interne Relationen und die 
Kontinuität in Wittgensteins Philosophie 
Katharina Anna Sodoma 
Wien, Österreich | katharina.anna.sodoma@gmail.com 
Abstract 
„Denk nicht, sondern schau“ – in dieser Maxime bringt Wittgenstein ein wichtiges Moment der methodischen Ausrichtung seiner 
Spätphilosophie auf den Punkt. Anhand von Tagebucheinträgen aus den Jahren 1914-1916 und dem Begriff der „internen Rela-
tionen“ im Tractatus soll in diesem Beitrag gezeigt werden, dass auch Wittgensteins Frühwerk – wenn auch innerhalb von 
Grenzen – von diesem Diktum gezeichnet ist. „Interne Relationen“ sind strukturelle Beziehungen zwischen Sätzen. Um Einsicht 
in das Funktionieren der Sprache zu gewinnen, müssen diese gesehen werden. Die spezielle logische Notation, die Wittgen-
stein im Tractatus entwickelt, bietet verschiedene Möglichkeiten, interne Relationen sichtbar zu machen. Auch wenn Wittgen-
stein den für die Spätphilosophie bedeutenden Begriff der „übersichtlichen Darstellung“ erstmals explizit einführt, spricht er da-
von, interne Beziehungen zu ‚illustrieren‘. Dies gibt Aufschluss über Parallelen, die zwischen der Methode des Tractatus und 
der Methode der Spätphilosophie bestehen. Anhand des Begriffs der „internen Relation“ soll eine Linie der Kontinuität zwischen 
Wittgensteins Früh- und Spätwerk nachgezeichnet werden. 
 
 
„[D]enk nicht, sondern schau“ (PU 66) – folgt man Kevin 
Cahills Argumentation, so drückt sich in dieser methodi-
schen Maxime des späten Wittgensteins der Grund für das 
Scheitern des Tractatus (zitiert als TLP) am eigenen (ethi-
schen) Anspruch aus. (Vgl. Cahill 2004) Dieser Anspruch 
besteht, laut Cahill, darin, das Verhältnis der Leserin zur 
Sprache zu verändern, zu klären und richtigzustellen. (Vgl. 
Cahill 2004: 48) Weil der Tractatus zu „intellektualistisch“ 
(Vgl. Cahill 2004: 49) ist, d.h. zu viel darüber nachdenkt, 
wie Sprache eigentlichen funktionieren müsste und zu we-
nig nachschaut, wie sie tatsächlich funktioniert, muss er an 
diesem selbstgesteckten Ziel scheitern. 
Diese Kritik scheint zu treffen, nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil 
die Aussage in den Philosophischen Untersuchungen (zi-
tiert als PU) tatsächlich im Zusammenhang einer Kritik am 
Tractatus steht. (Vgl. PU 65-67) Trotzdem erwecken man-
che Passagen aus dem Tractatus und aus den Tagebü-
chern (zitiert als Tb), die Wittgenstein zur Zeit der Arbeit 
am Tractatus führt, den Eindruck, dass die wesentlichen 
Einsichten in Bezug auf die Philosophie, die auf die zuge-
spitzte Formulierung „Denk nicht, sondern schau“ hinaus-
laufen, zu diesem frühen Zeitpunkt bereits gewonnen sind.  
Ausgehend von diesen Passagen soll in diesem Beitrag 
der Frage nachgegangen werden, inwiefern und in wel-
chen Grenzen Wittgenstein im Frühwerk dieser Maxime 
des Spätwerks gerecht wird. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf 
dem Begriff der „internen Relation“.  
Der Rückgang auf das methodische Vorgehen des Trac-
tatus bietet auch Aufschluss darüber, warum Wittgenstein 
von einer „internen Beziehung“ spricht, wenn er ein Kon-
zept einführt, das für die Spätphilosophie von zentraler 
Bedeutung ist: den Begriff der „übersichtlichen Darstel-
lung“. Parallelen zwischen der Methode des Tractatus und 
der Methode der Spätphilosophie deuten auf eine bisher 
unbeachtete Linie der Kontinuität zwischen Wittgensteins 
Früh- und Spätwerk, die anhand des Begriffs der „internen 
Relation“ nachgezeichnet werden kann. 
1. Überlegungen zur Philosophie und die 
Rolle der logischen Notation im Tracta-
tus 
Die Tagebücher, die Wittgenstein zwischen 1914 und 
1916 führt, zeugen von einer intensiven und kritischen 
Auseinandersetzung mit Fragen nach der Aufgabe der 
Philosophie, ihren Möglichkeiten und Grenzen und der 
richtigen philosophischen Methode.  
Der erste Eintrag beginnt mit einer Einsicht, die auch in 
die Endfassung des Tractatus Eingang gefunden hat: „Die 
Logik muss für sich selbst sorgen.“ (Tb 22.8.14, Vgl. TLP 
5.473) Diese Aussage impliziert eine Absage an eine Auf-
fassung von Philosophie, gemäß der die Philosophie für 
die Logik Sorge tragen müsste, etwa indem sie logische 
Regeln aufstellt oder dafür sorgt, dass diese eingehalten 
werden. Diese Absage bringt eine Schwierigkeit mit sich. 
„Wie ist es mit der Aufgabe der Philosophie vereinbar, daß 
die Logik für sich selbst sorgen soll?“ (Tb 3.9.14), notiert 
Wittgenstein wenige Tage später. Diese Frage scheint zu 
diesem Zeitpunkt genau so offen wie dringlich zu sein.  
Einige Wochen später zeichnet sich eine Antwort ab. 
Wittgenstein schreibt in sein Tagebuch: „Die Logik sorgt 
für sich selbst; wir müssen ihr nur zusehen, wie sie es 
macht.“ (Tb 13.10.14) Die Nähe zum Diktum der Spätphi-
losophie, „Denk nicht, sondern schau“, ist an dieser Stelle 
besonders deutlich. Spätere Einträge vertiefen diese Ein-
sicht. Einige Monate darauf notiert Wittgenstein, „Wir müs-
sen erkennen, wie die Sprache für sich selbst sorgt“ (Tb 
26.4.15) und ergänzt am darauffolgenden Tag: „Ich darf 
mich nicht um die Sprache kümmern brauchen.“ (Tb 
27.4.15).  
Diese Einträge haben für den Tractatus indirekt Bedeu-
tung. Obwohl sie nicht in den Text der Endfassung über-
nommen wurden, bilden sie den Hintergrund für Wittgen-
steins methodisches Vorgehen. Insbesondere die Rolle, 
die logische Notation im Tractaus spielt, wird in Verbin-
dung mit dieser Auffassung von Philosophie verständlich.  
Im Tractatus schreibt Wittgenstein manche Sätze in 
Russells Notation einfach hin und fordert auf, diese genau 
zu betrachten. (Vgl. z.B. TLP 5.5301). An anderen Stellen 
macht er durch Umformulierungen und Erläuterungen auf 
bestimmte Aspekte aufmerksam. (Vgl. z.B. TLP 5.1311) In 
diesem Vorgehen drückt sich die Überzeugung aus, dass 

„Denk nicht, sondern schau“ – Interne Relationen und die Kontinuität in Wittgensteins Philosophie | Katharina Anna Sodoma 
 
 
 
265
sich die logischen Beziehungen der Sprache, die für ihr 
Funktionieren ausschlaggebend sind, in den Sätzen selbst 
zeigen. 
In Bezug auf die Wahrnehmbarkeit dessen, was sich in 
der Sprache zeigt, gibt Wittgenstein manchen Darstel-
lungsweisen gegenüber anderen den Vorzug. Bruchstück-
haft und scheinbar unsystematisch entwickelt er  im Trac-
tatus eigene Mittel der logischen Darstellung. Dieser spe-
ziellen logischen Notation spricht er den Vorteil zu, dass 
sie Missverständnissen vorbeugt  (Vgl. TLP 3.525, 5.534) 
und die logischen Verhältnisse der Sprache klarer hervor-
treten lässt. 
Gemäß den Überlegungen, die Wittgenstein in den Ta-
gebüchern anstellt, ist es weder die Aufgabe der Philoso-
phie die Sprache zu reglementieren, noch sie zu erklären. 
Die philosophische Schwierigkeit ist eine andere, wenn 
auch keine geringere. Im Zusammenhang mit Bemerkun-
gen zur Untersuchung verschiedener Satzzeichen bringt 
Wittgenstein diese spezifische Herausforderung zum Aus-
druck, wenn er schreibt: „Meine Schwierigkeit ist nur eine – 
enorme – Schwierigkeit des Ausdrucks.“ (Tb 8.3.15) 
2. Der Begriff der „internen Relation“ im 
Tractatus 
Die Begriffe „interne Eigenschaft“ und „interne Beziehung“ 
oder der gleichbedeutende Ausdruck „interne Relation“ 
kommen aus dem britischen Idealismus. Sie bezeichnen in 
diesem Kontext Eigenschaften oder Beziehungen, die ei-
nem Gegenstand notwendig zukommen, in dem Sinn, 
dass der Gegenstand nicht derselbe wäre, wenn er diese  
Eigenschaft nicht hätte oder nicht in dieser Beziehung 
stünde. (Vgl. Moore 1919: 47) 
In Wittgensteins Verwendung wird dieser Aspekt beibe-
halten (Vgl.TLP 2.01231, 4.123), aber der Begriff bekommt 
eine neue Wendung: Interne Eigenschaften und Bezie-
hungen sind im Tractatus als Eigenschaften und Bezie-
hungen von Strukturen definiert. (Vgl. TLP 4.122) „Struk-
tur“ bedeutet im Kontext des Tractatus etwa so viel wie 
„Art des Zusammenhangs der Elemente“ oder „Art wie sich 
Elemente zu einander verhalten“. (Vgl. TLP 2.032, 2.15) 
Interne Eigenschaften sind Eigenschaften, die Strukturen 
aufgrund ihrer Zusammensetzung haben. Sie werden so-
wohl von den Strukturen ausgesagt, als auch von einzel-
nen Elementen.  
Im Tractatus bezieht sich Wittgenstein auf interne Rela-
tionen zwischen verschiedenen Strukturen. Seine Bemer-
kungen fallen in zwei Gruppen: einerseits spricht er von 
internen Relation zwischen sprachlichen Ausdrücken und 
anderen sprachlichen Ausdrücken (Vgl. z.B. TLP 3.24, 
5.2), andererseits von internen Relationen zwischen 
sprachlichen Ausdrücken und dem, was sie bezeichnen 
(Vgl. z.B. TLP 4.014). Jene erstere Gruppe von Sätzen, 
die Beziehung zwischen Sätzen betreffend, ist für den As-
pekt der Kontinuität in Wittgensteins Philosophie beson-
ders ausschlaggebend. 
Der Begriff „interne Beziehung“ kommt zum ersten Mal in 
Aufzeichnungen, die G.E. Moore in Norwegen nach Diktat 
niedergeschrieben hat vor. Wittgenstein reflektiert an die-
ser Stelle auf die Vielfältigkeit interner Beziehungen. Er 
schreibt: „Sätze können untereinander viele verschiedene 
interne Beziehungen haben.“ (Wittgenstein 1984a: 220)  
Zur Zeit der Arbeit am Tractatus interessiert sich Witt-
genstein aber nur für eine bestimmte Art von internen Be-
ziehungen zwischen Sätzen. Dies hängt mit anderen As-
pekten des Tractatus zusammen, insbesondere der Idee 
des Elementarsatzes, der in einer abbildenden Beziehung 
zur Welt steht (Vgl. z.B. TLP 4.01) und der Idee, dass alle 
Sätze entweder selbst Elementarsätze oder Wahrheits-
funktionen von Elementarsätzen sind. (Vgl. z.B. TLP 5.3) 
Interne Beziehungen, die im Rahmen einer solchen Kon-
zeption von Sprache von Bedeutung sind, sind z.B. Folge-
rung (Vgl. Wittgenstein 1984a: 220, TLP 4.1211) und Wi-
derspruch (Vgl. Tb 24.11.14, TLP 4.1211), sowie das 
scheinbare Vorkommen eines Satzes in einem anderen 
(Vgl. Wittgenstein 1984a: 220, TLP 5.54f.) und die interne 
Beziehung von einem Satz, „welcher vom Komplex handelt 
[…] zum Satze, der von dessen Bestandteil handelt“ (TLP 
3.24). 
Interne Eigenschaften und Relationen werden im Tracta-
tus von den „eigentlichen (externen)“ (TLP 4.122) Eigen-
schaften und Relationen abgegrenzt, die sich durch ein- 
oder mehrstellige Prädikate ausdrücken lassen. Bereits in 
den Aufzeichnungen, die G.E. Moore in Norwegen nach 
Diktat niedergeschrieben hat schreibt Wittgenstein, dass 
sich interne Beziehungen „nicht mit Sätzen ausdrücken“ 
(Wittgenstein 1984a: 220) lassen, sondern „sämtlich durch 
die Symbole selbst gezeigt werden“ (ibd.) aber „systema-
tisch“ (ibd.) dargestellt werden können.  
Im Tractatus verwendet Wittgenstein verschiedene Mittel 
der Notation um interne Relationen „systematisch“ darzu-
stellen. Ein Beispiel ist die Darstellung von Sätzen als Ba-
sis beziehungsweise Resultat einer Operation. Wittgen-
stein bezeichnet die Operation einerseits als „Ausdruck 
einer Beziehung zwischen […] Strukturen“ (TLP 5.22) und 
andererseits als das, „was mit einem Satz geschehen 
muß, um aus ihm den anderen zu machen.“ (TLP 5.23) 
Entscheidend ist, dass die Operation selbst nichts be-
zeichnet (Vgl. TLP 5.241), sondern nur ein Verhältnis zum 
Ausdruck bringt. Durch die Darstellung als Basis und Re-
sultat einer Operation können bestimmte Ähnlichkeiten 
(Vgl. TLP 5.23, 5.231) und Unterschiede (Vgl. TLP 5.24, 
5.241) zwischen den Strukturen von Sätzen herausgeho-
ben werden. 
Das prominenteste Beispiel für eine Operation im Tracta-
tus ist der N-Operator, der alle Sätze in der Klammer ver-
neint. So kann beispielsweise die Beziehung zwischen den 
Sätzen p und q und einem Satz r, der p und q verneint (r = 
~(pvq)), durch die Operation (---W)(p,q) (Vgl. TLP 5.5) 
bzw. N(ξ), ξ=p,q (Vgl. TLP 5.502), deren Resultat r ist, 
dargestellt werden. Die internen Beziehungen zwischen p, 
q und r, die Ähnlichkeiten und Unterschiede sowie dass r 
sowohl p als auch q widerspricht werden dadurch beson-
ders deutlich.  
Ein weiteres Beispiel für eine Darstellungsweise, die be-
stimmte interne Relationen hervorhebt, ist die Bildung von 
Tautologien. Dieses Mittel hängt eng mit Wittgensteins 
Auffassung der logischen Folgerung zusammen. Der zu-
folge zeigt sich, dass ein Satz aus einem anderen folgt, an 
den Strukturen dieser Sätze selbst. (Vgl. TLP 5.13)  
Die für die Folgerung ausschlaggebenden internen Be-
ziehungen zwischen Sätzen bestehen von sich aus, „so-
bald, und dadurch daß, jene Sätze bestehen“ (Vgl. TLP 
5.131) und müssen nur gesehen werden. Eine Möglichkeit 
sie hervorzuheben ist die Darstellung als Tautologie. Witt-
genstein gibt in diesem Zusammenhang das folgende Bei-
spiel: „Daß z.B. ‚q‘ aus ‚p⊃q.p‘ folgt, ersehen wir aus die-
sen beiden Sätzen selbst, aber wir können es auch so zei-
gen, indem wir sie zu ‚p⊃q.p:⊃:q‘ verbinden und nun zei-
gen, daß dies eine Tautologie ist.“ (TLP 6.1221) 
Am Begriff der internen Relation wird Wittgensteins Auf-
fassung, der zufolge die Sprache selbst zeigt wie sie funk-

 266
tioniert und die Philosophie nur aufmerksam hinzusehen 
braucht, besonders deutlich.  
Obwohl Wittgenstein in diesen Beispielen konkrete Mittel 
der Darstellung anwendet, um interne Relationen hervor-
zuheben, macht er klar, dass diese letztlich beliebig sind. 
So schreibt er etwa, dass wir auch ohne das Bilden von 
Tautologien auskommen können, „da wir ja in einer ent-
sprechenden Notation die formalen Eigenschaften der 
Sätze durch das bloße Ansehen dieser Sätze erkennen 
können.“ (TLP 6.122) Alles, was es um Klarheit zu erlan-
gen zu erkennen gilt, ist an den Zeichen der Sätze selbst 
und deren Anwendung (Vgl. TLP 3.262, 3.326, 3.327) ab-
zulesen.  
Diese Einsicht kommt auch im Tagebuch zum Ausdruck, 
wo Wittgenstein erwägt interne Relationen durch bloße 
Gegenüberstellung 
von 
Sätzen 
herauszustellen. 
Er 
schreibt: „Immer wieder entsteht das Bedürfnis nach einer 
vergleichenden Zusammenstellung von Sätzen, die in in-
ternen Beziehungen stehen. Man könnte zu diesem Buch 
geradezu Bildertafeln anlegen.“ (Tb 14.10.14) 
3. Interne Relationen und „übersichtliche 
Darstellung“ 
Wie entwickelt sich der Begriff der „internen Relation“, 
wenn Wittgensteins Philosophieren sich vom Tractatus 
weg entwickelt? Laut Rupert Read nimmt die Bedeutung 
des Begriffs in den Jahren des Übergangs zum Spätwerk 
immer mehr ab, bis er ganz verschwindet und schließlich 
in den Philosophischen Untersuchungen und Über Gewiß-
heit überhaupt nicht mehr vorkommt. (Vgl. Read 1997)  
Diese Einschätzung übersieht einerseits, dass der Beg-
riff für Wittgenstein im Zusammenhang mit seinen Bemer-
kungen über die Grundlagen der Mathematik und Bemer-
kungen über die Farben bis zuletzt eine wichtige Rolle 
spielt und andererseits, dass der Begriff beteiligt ist, wenn 
ein für das Spätwerk Wittgensteins zentraler Begriff einge-
führt wird: der Begriff der „übersichtlichen Darstellung“. 
Der Begriff der übersichtlichen Darstellung kommt zum 
ersten Mal in Philosophische Bemerkungen vor. Allerdings 
äußert sich Wittgenstein an dieser Stelle nur relativ knapp, 
wenn er schreibt: „Die Oktaeder-Darstellung ist eine über-
sichtliche Darstellung der grammatischen Regeln.“ (Witt-
genstein 1984: 52) 
In Bemerkungen zu Frazers Golden Bough macht Witt-
genstein den Begriff erstmals explizit. Die Zusammenfas-
sung der Daten „durch die Gruppierung des Tatsachenma-
terials allein, in einer ‚übersichtlichen‘ Darstellung“ (Witt-
genstein 1993: 132) wird in diesem Text als Alternative 
und Gegenmodell zur Darstellungsweise des Ethnologen 
Frazer, der die gesammelten Daten in einer Entwicklungs-
hypothese zusammenfasst, eingeführt. 
Im Kontrast zum Vorgehen des Wissenschaftlers besteht 
die Art des Verständnisses, das die übersichtliche Darstel-
lung vermittelt, nicht in Vermutungen über verborgene Zu-
sammenhänge, sondern darin, „daß wir die ‚Zusammen-
hänge sehen‘“ (ibd.). Als Mittel, um diese Zusammenhän-
ge herauszustellen, nennt Wittgenstein an dieser Stelle 
das Finden von „Zwischengliedern“ (ibd.), das er wie folgt 
erläutert: 
 Ein hypothetisches Zwischenglied aber soll in diesem 
Fall nichts tun, als die Aufmerksamkeit  auf die Ähnlich-
keit, den Zusammenhang der Tatsachen, lenken. Wie man 
eine interne  Beziehung der Kreisform zur Ellipse dadurch 
illustrierte, daß man eine Ellipse allmählich in  einen Kreis 
überführt; aber nicht um zu behaupten, daß eine gewisse 
Ellipse tatsächlich,  historisch, aus einem Kreis entstanden 
wäre (Entwicklungshypothese), sondern nur um unser 
 Auge für einen formalen Zusammenhang zu schärfen. 
(ibd.) 
Ohne für die stärkere Behauptung zu argumentieren, 
dass es bei der übersichtlichen Darstellung ebenfalls um 
das Herausarbeiten interner Beziehungen zwischen Sät-
zen geht, kann der Rückgriff auf den Tractatus den Bezug 
auf den Begriff der internen Beziehung in dieser Passage 
erklären: sowie beim Hervorheben interner Beziehungen 
durch die Mittel der logischen Notation im Tractatus, geht 
es bei der übersichtlichen Darstellung darum, Zusammen-
hänge hervorzuheben. Diese bestehen ohne unser Zutun 
und müssen nicht in Form von Hypothesen hinzugesetzt 
werden. Zweck der Hervorhebung ist, Klarheit dadurch zu 
schaffen, dass wir die Zusammenhänge sehen.  
Das Finden hypothetischer Zwischenglieder, als ein 
mögliches Mittel der übersichtlichen Darstellung, hat be-
stimmte Ähnlichkeiten zur Operationsdarstellung im Trac-
tatus: In beiden Fällen wird unser Auge für eine Zusam-
menhang geschärft, indem ein möglicher Übergang aufge-
zeigt wird, ohne dabei zu behaupten, dass der Übergang 
tatsächlich gemacht wurde.  
Beide Vorgehensweisen nehmen von einer spezifischen 
Auffassung der Philosophie ihren Ausgang, der zufolge 
alles, was wir um Klarheit zu erlangen benötigen, bereits 
offen daliegt und es daher nicht Aufgabe der Philosophie 
ist, etwas hinzuzufügen – Erklärungen und Theorien oder 
„philosophische Sätze“ (TLP 4.112) etwa – sondern die 
Zusammenhänge durch eine Anstrengung der Darstellung 
sichtbar zu machen.  
Diese Auffassung von Philosophie ist in der Maxime 
„Denk nicht, sondern schau“ zusammengefasst, der Witt-
gensteins Philosophieren von Beginn an von verpflichtet 
ist. Allerdings gelingt es ihm im Tractatus nur innerhalb 
von Grenzen dieser auch gerecht zu werden. Diese Gren-
zen sind durch die Beschränkung des Interesses auf logi-
sche Beziehungen zwischen Elementarsätzen vorgege-
ben.

„Denk nicht, sondern schau!“  
Intuitive versus rationale Betrachtung bei Wittgenstein 
Ilse Somavilla 
Innsbruck, Österreich | Ilse.Somavilla@uibk.ac.at 
Abstract 
Ausgehend von dem Satz “Denk nicht, sondern schau!” (PU, §§ 66) soll in diesem Beitrag Wittgensteins intuitiver Zugang zu 
den Objekten seines Philosophieren untersucht werden – dies in Gegenüberstellung zu seinen rational bestimmten, 
analytischen Untersuchungen. 
 
 
In diesem Beitrag geht es um Wittgensteins unterschiedli-
che Herangehensweise an die Objekte seines Philoso-
phierens. Ausgangspunkt soll der in den Philosophischen 
Untersuchungen unter § 66 festgehaltene Satz „denk 
nicht, sondern schau!“ sein, der Wittgensteins Appell an 
einen nicht rationalen, sondern vielmehr intuitiven Zugang 
zu den vor unseren Augen befindlichen Phänomenen ent-
hält. 
Obgleich dieser Zugang vor allem die spätere Phase 
seiner Philosophie bestimmte, sind meines Erachtens be-
reits in frühen Jahren Tendenzen zu einer nicht-
analytischen, man kann sagen, nicht-wissenschaftlichen 
Betrachtungsweise der phänomenalen Welt zu beobach-
ten – ganz zu schweigen von seinem Zugang zu dem au-
ßerhalb der Welt der Tatsachen befindlichen Bereich. So 
heißt es im Tractatus, 6.52: 
Wir fühlen, daß, selbst wenn alle möglichen wissen-
schaftlichen Fragen beantwortet sind, unsere Lebens-
probleme noch gar nicht berührt sind. Freilich bleibt 
dann eben keine Frage mehr; und eben dies ist die 
Antwort.  
Allein das Wort „fühlen“ deutet eine nicht rationale Rich-
tung an, die sich 1929 und später in weiteren emotional 
bestimmten Bemerkungen fortsetzt: 
„Irgendwie scheint es mir [...]“ (MS 105, 7) 
„Einerseits fühle ich [...] Anderseits kann ich nicht ver-
stehen [...]“ (MS 106, 80) 
„Ja es ist mir als wäre [...]“ (MS 107, 55)  
„Das Gefühl an das ich jetzt alle meine Betrachtungen 
knüpfe [...]“ (MS 108, 208)   
„Hier bin ich nun geneigt zu sagen: [...] Aber ich fühle 
auch daß das eine irreführende Ausdrucksweise ist.“ 
(MS 115, 20) 
Im Bewusstsein der Schwierigkeit, sprachphilosophische 
Probleme eindeutig zu erfassen und zu definieren, da un-
sere Worte im Gebrauch verschwommen, vage und viel-
schichtig sind und auf unterschiedlichste Weise interpre-
tiert werden können, geht Wittgenstein nicht mehr mit jener 
Bestimmtheit vor, in der er im Vorwort des Tractatus ver-
kündet hatte: „Dagegen scheint mir die W a h r h e i t der 
hier mitgeteilten Gedanken unantastbar und definitiv. Ich 
bin also der Meinung, die Probleme im Wesentlichen end-
gültig gelöst zu haben."  
Nun dominieren Unsicherheit und Zweifel statt Sicherheit 
in der Überzeugung rational erklärbarer Aussagen: 
„Ich sehe noch kein System in allen diesen Fragen.“ 
(MS 105, 15)  
„Wie geht es weiter?“ (MS 105, 27) 
„Ich bin mit allen meinen Gedanken über diesen Ge-
genstand 
noch 
immer 
in 
einem 
furchtbaren 
{Wir}rwarr<!> zwischen erstem & zweitem Ausdrucks-
system. Das mei{s}te von dem was ich {j}etzt sagen 
möchte braucht man & kann man gar nicht sagen.“ (MS 
107, 265) 
Das bestimmte, zielgerichtete und oftmals arrogante Vor-
gehen mancher Wissenschaftler sowie die Anmaßung der 
Richtigkeit wissenschaftlicher Aussagen ist ihm suspekt – 
einerseits, da sie den Anspruch stellen, alles erklären zu 
können, andererseits, da er durch rationale Erklärungen 
das Staunen des Menschen gefährdet sieht. 
Mit zunehmender Betonung von Beschreibung statt Er-
klärung kommt der Aspekt des „Schauens“ zum Vorschein: 
eines Schauens, das einer staunenden Haltung entspricht, 
die, anstatt des Versuchs zu analysieren und zu erklären, 
sich dem Eindruck des Geschauten hingibt und sich damit 
begnügt. D.h. sich damit begnügt, nicht zum Kern der Din-
ge vorzustoßen, sondern diese so zu belassen, wie sie 
sich unserer sinnlichen Anschauung geben.  
Wie der Mond, wenn wir nur die Hälfte von ihm sehen – 
ein Beispiel, das Wittgenstein nahm, um seine philosophi-
sche Betrachtungsweise zu verdeutlichen. So bemerkt er 
im MS 110, S. 180: „[Ein Motto für dieses Buch: ‚Seht ihr 
den Mond dort stehn? Er ist nur halb zu sehn und ist doch 
rund und schön’]“ 
Unmittelbar danach fährt er fort: „Eine Erklärung ist im 
Vergleich mit dem Eindruck, den uns das Beschriebene 
macht, zu unsicher. Jede Erklärung ist ja nur eine Hypo-
these.“  
Es geht dabei um eine intuitive Erfassung, die sich mit 
dem Eindruck des Geschauten zufrieden gibt und auf dis-
kursives Räsonieren verzichtet.  
Das Genügen an bloßer Beschreibung statt Erklärung 
mag bei Wittgenstein, dessen rationale, auf Analyse ge-
richtete Untersuchungen weite Teile seines Werks durch-
ziehen, befremdend wirken. Doch wäre dies nicht der ein-
zige Widerspruch in seinen Äußerungen wie insgesamt in 
seiner philosophischen Methode.  
Als einer, in der Tradition Platons, Kants und Schopen-
hauers stehend, mit technisch-naturwissenschaftlichen 
Kenntnissen sowie einer ausgeprägten Neigung für Kunst 
und Musik, war Wittgenstein Haltung gegenüber der Philo-
sophie und den Wissenschaften ambivalent – wie seine

einerseits analytischen Untersuchungen, andererseits sein 
teilweise mystischer und künstlerischer Zugang zu philo-
sophischen Fragestellungen belegen. Bei Betrachtung 
seines Gesamtwerks, des allmählichen Übergangs von der 
logisch-stringenten, sprachanalytischen Arbeitsweise im 
Tractatus zu seinen Untersuchungen von Wörtern im all-
täglichen Sprachgebrauch, der Bedeutung von Beschrei-
bung und Grammatik, sind diese scheinbaren Inkonse-
quenzen und Widerspruche im Grunde als sich entwi-
ckelnde Phasen zu betrachten, die sich aus einer regen, 
stets neuen und dabei sich verändernden Betrachtungs-
weise ergeben. Einer Betrachtungsweise, die alle nur 
möglichen bzw. erdenklichen Aspekte der Objekte seines 
Philosophierens berücksichtigt – Aspekte, die sich aus den 
unterschiedlichen Perspektiven ergeben.  
Der Satz „Denk nicht, sondern schau!“ steht innerhalb 
seiner Überlegungen zu dem Begriff „Familienähnlichkeit“, 
den er anhand der Vergleiche verschiedener Spiele und 
Spielarten miteinander erforscht. Dabei ist dieser Satz 
nicht nur als Appell (an den Gesprächspartner oder Leser) 
zu sehen, die Ähnlichkeiten in verschiedenen Erscheinun-
gen durch aufmerksame Betrachtung bzw. „schauend“ zu 
entdecken, sondern insgesamt als Aufforderung, die viel-
fältigen Facetten aller Phänomene zu berücksichtigen. Es 
kommt darauf an, die sich immer neu ergebenden Aspekte 
wahrzunehmen, und somit eine neue Sichtweise – durch 
den Aspektwechsel, der „aufleuchtet“ – zu erreichen.  
In diesem Zusammenhang ist auf die Bedeutung des 
„Einfalls“ hinzuweisen, dem in Wittgensteins Philosophie-
ren eine wichtige Rolle zukommt und der ja eng mit Intuiti-
on, spontanem Erkennen zusammenhängt, dabei zu im-
mer neuen Einsichten führt.  
Das Erkennen des Aspektwechsels entspringt aus einer 
Art staunender Haltung, der jedoch auch ein rationales 
Element innewohnt, insofern nicht nur aus einem „Schau-
en“ fragloser Art besteht. „Staunen ist Denken“ (LSPP, § 
565), schreibt Wittgenstein, und das Aufleuchten des As-
pekts sowohl Seh- als auch Denkerlebnis (vgl. LSPP, § 
564). Damit widerlegt er wiederum seinen, in zahlreichen 
anderen Bemerkungen implizit enthaltenen, Appell an eine 
nicht-rationale, kontemplative Haltung – wie in folgendem 
Beispiel:  
Auch der Mathematiker kann natürlich die Wunder (das 
Krystall) der Natur anstaunen; aber kann er es, wenn 
es einmal problematisch geworden ist, was er sieht? Ist 
es wirklich möglich, solange eine philosophische Trübe 
das verschleiert, was das Staunenswerte oder Ange-
staunte ist? 
Ich könnte mir denken, daß Einer Bäume bewundert, & 
auch die Schatten, oder Spiegelungen von Bäumen, die 
er für Bäume hält. Sagt er sich aber einmal, daß dies 
doch keine Bäume sind & wird es für ihn problematisch, 
was sie sind, oder was ihre Beziehung zu Bäumen ist, 
dann hat die Bewunderung einen Riß, der erst zu heilen 
ist. (MS 134, 27)  
Um staunen zu können, heißt es, auf eine wissenschaftli-
che Betrachtungsweise im Sinne eines Strebens nach Er-
klärung zu verzichten, um einen sozusagen natürlichen, 
unvoreingenommenen Zugang zu den Dingen zu gewin-
nen.  
Ähnlich Schopenhauer, der zwischen der gewöhnlichen 
sowie wissenschaftlichen Betrachtung der Dinge, die dem 
Satz vom Grunde folgt, und der höheren bzw. ästhetischen 
und intuitiven Betrachtung unterscheidet, trifft Wittgenstein 
eine klare Scheidung zwischen der wissenschaftlichen Be-
trachtung einer Tatsache und der Betrachtung einer Tat-
sache als Wunder – wie er im Vortrag über Ethik erläutert 
und ein Beispiel davon gibt, wie die wissenschaftliche Be-
trachtungsweise unser Staunen zerstören kann.  
Im Gegensatz dazu geht es Wittgenstein um ein intuiti-
ves Verstehen, eine Betrachtung der Anschauung, die sich 
mit dem Gesamteindruck des Geschauten zufrieden gibt, 
ohne rationale Erwägungen anzustellen. Denn im abstrak-
ten und begrifflichen Denken von Wissenschaftlern sieht er 
die Gefahr, dass der Blick für das Wesentliche „getrübt“, 
die Fähigkeit zum Staunen verloren gehe. Es war ihm ein 
Anliegen, gegen diese „Trübe“ anzukämpfen, um Klarheit 
– Transparenz – zu gewinnen und zu bewahren. Allerdings 
kann in seiner Kritik an einer analytischen Vorgangsweise 
insofern ein Widerspruch zu sehen sein, als gerade diese 
nach vollkommener Klarheit strebt. Abgesehen davon 
kann wissenschaftliche Erforschung von vorher Unbekann-
tem und Unerklärtem zu einem sich stufenweise fortset-
zenden Erstaunen über immer neue Entdeckungen führen, 
wie es Wittgenstein in Zusammenhang mit dem vorhin er-
örterten Aspektsehen ja darstellt.  
Und bekannterweise fordert er von der Philosophie, die 
uns bzw. dem common sense selbstverständlich erschei-
nenden Phänomene zu hinterfragen – gemäß dem An-
spruch an die philosophische Methode, „eine Methode des 
Wahnsinns“ zu sein, die den Wahnsinn dann wieder heilen 
solle. (Vgl. MS 127, 76)  
Die bereits im Tractatus spürbare kritische Haltung ge-
genüber den Wissenschaften und die Neigung zu einer 
nicht analysierenden ganzheitlichen Betrachtung der Din-
ge bzw. Akzeptanz der Einsicht der Grenzen von Sprache 
und Wissenschaft geht aus späteren Bemerkungen Witt-
gensteins immer wieder hervor. Besonders deutlich wird 
das an folgender Stelle: 
„Zum Staunen muß der Mensch – und vielleicht Völker 
– aufwachen. Die Wissenschaft ist ein Mittel um ihn 
wieder einzuschläfern.“  
Diese Bemerkung trug er am 5.11.1930 ein, also ca. ein 
Jahr nach seinem Vortrag über Ethik  und ca. zwei Monate 
nach neu aufgegriffenen Gedanken zur Betrachtung sub 
specie aeternitatis – der von Spinoza in seiner Ethik dar-
gestellten höchsten Erkenntnisweise, die dieser ausdrück-
lich als eine intuitive, anschauliche Erkenntnis bezeichnet 
und die eine Art geistige Anschauung bedeutet. Zur selben 
Zeit äußerte Wittgenstein sein Abseitsstehen vom „typi-
schen westlichen Wissenschaftler“, der den Geist, in dem 
er schreibe, nicht verstehen würde, da sein Ziel und seine 
Denkbewegung eine andere sei. (VB, S. 30f.) 
Hinsichtlich der oben zitierten Bemerkung über das 
Staunen mag sein Verzicht auf Erklärung von Geheimnis-
vollem, um dieses als etwas Geheimnisvolles bzw. Ver-
borgenes zu respektieren und als solches zu belassen, 
widersprüchlich anmuten, da der antike Begriff des Stau-
nens – das thaumazein – mit dem Begriff aletheia in Zu-
sammenhang steht, der das Entbergen von Verborgenem 
bedeutet. 
Doch es gibt auch Bemerkungen Wittgensteins, wo er 
die Erklärung von früher Rätselhaftem wie Naturerschei-
nungen nicht als Hindernis für einen Verlust an Bewunde-
rung sieht. Im Gegenteil, gerade der „erwachende Geist 
des Menschen“ sollte sich der Bedeutung auch von erklär-
ten, zur Selbstverständlichkeit gewordenen Phänomenen 
bewusst sein und diesen in einer Haltung der Ehrfurcht 
begegnen. 1 Dies setzt eine Wachheit voraus, die im Ge-

gensatz zu der vorhin erörterten, von den Wissenschaften 
verursachten „Einschläferung“ steht, die mit Gleichgültig-
keit und Stumpfheit gegenüber dem unmittelbar Gegebe-
nen und nicht mehr Beachteten, da alltäglich Gesehenen 
und Erlebten, zusammenhängt. In dieser Hinsicht ist auch 
die ethische Bedeutung des im Vortrag über Ethik be-
schriebenen „Staunens über die Existenz der Welt“ zu se-
hen – als Appell zum „Wachsein“ im Sinne intensiver 
Wahrnehmung und staunender Bewunderung. 
Wesentlich ist die Akzeptanz und Einhaltung der Gren-
zen – die der Sprache und der Wissenschaft. Und die der 
Philosophie: „In der Philosophie liegt die Schwierigkeit dar-
in, nicht mehr zu sagen, als was wir wissen“, bemerkte er 
im Blauen Buch (BB, S. 75). 
Anstelle diskursiver Zugänge und begrifflicher Erklärun-
gen verweist Wittgenstein auf die Bedeutung unmittelba-
ren Verstehens. Dieses, in der Philosophischen Gramma-
tik auch als „intransitives Verstehen“ bezeichnet, sieht er 
im Gegensatz zu einem interpretierenden Verstehen. In 
den PU (§ 522-536) wird eine ähnliche Unterscheidung 
getroffen, wo er die Ähnlichkeit zwischen dem Verstehen 
von Sprache und dem Verstehen von Kunst erörtert. Die 
Bedeutung des unmittelbaren Erfassens bzw. intransitiven 
Verstehens spielt insbesondere bei der Betrachtung eines 
Kunstwerks eine Rolle und Wittgenstein lässt keinen Zwei-
fel daran, dass dieses Verstehen mit Gefühl zu tun hat – 
dem Gefühl der Vertrautheit, des Wohlbekannten, der 
„Wohlvertrautheit“ (PG, 78f.). Kjell S. Johannessen ist der 
Meinung, dass sich dieses Verstehen ganz auf das sinn-
lich Angeschaute, nicht auf irgendeine transzendente Idee 
richte. Meines Erachtens sollte jedoch der kognitive Aspekt 
nicht völlig übergangen werden, wenn auch die Sinne und 
Emotionen im Vordergrund zu stehen scheinen. Das Ge-
fühl der Wohlvertrautheit setzt voraus, dass der Betrachter 
im angeschauten Objekt etwas erkennt, das mehr als die 
sichtbare Erscheinung bedeutet. Das bloße Anschauen 
eines konkreten Gegenstands – im Falle einer Zeichnung 
die Wahrnehmung der einzelnen Striche der Zeichnung – 
könnte das von Wittgenstein beschriebene Gefühl der Ver-
trautheit nicht bewirken. Das heißt nicht, dass nur der Intel-
lekt – wie bei Schopenhauers Darstellung des „reinen Sub-
jekts des Erkennens“ – tätig ist; bei Wittgensteins intransi-
tivem Verstehen spielen Sinneswahrnehmung und Gefühl 
ebenso herein wie das Geistige. Er schreibt ausdrücklich, 
dass es sich beim unmittelbaren Verstehen eines Bildes 
nicht um ein Erkennen handle, wie beim Erkennen eines 
alten Bekannten auf der Straße. Die Wohlbekanntheit liege 
vielmehr darin, dass „ich sofort einen bestimmten Rhyth-
mus des Bildes ergreife und bei ihm bleibe, sozusagen in 
ihm ruhe“. (PG, 78f.) Wittgenstein ist sogar dermaßen „ge-
fangen“, dass er nicht einmal das Bedürfnis verspürt, neue 
Aspekte zu entdecken.2 Er hat aufgehört, weiter zu fragen, 
nach dem Aspektwechsel Ausschau zu halten, der ein 
Umdeuten des Wohlbekannten und Unruhe in den Gedan-
ken mit sich bringen würde. Es scheint, als ziehe Wittgen-
stein ein Ruhen in intuitiver anschaulicher Betrachtung 
einem Streben nach rationaler Erklärung vor. 
Ein weiterer Grund dafür, dass es sich nicht nur um das 
rein sinnlich Angeschaute handelt, geht aus der Bemer-
kung hervor, dass er das Gefühl der Wohlvertrautheit nicht 
bei jedem Bild erfahre, wie er auch nicht jedes Bild sofort 
„erfasse“. Sähe er also nur die einzelnen Striche etc. bzw. 
                                                                             
es uns werden, und das ist eben das Charakteristische am erwachenden 
Geist des Menschen, daß ihm eine Erscheinung bedeutend wird.“ 
2 Vgl. Zettel, Nr. 234, wo ebenfalls vom „heimisch fühlen“ die Rede ist: „Nicht 
das findet statt, daß sich dieses Symbol nicht mehr deuten läßt, sondern: ich 
deute nicht. Ich deute nicht, weil ich mich in dem gegenwärtigen Bild heimisch 
fühle. Wenn ich deute, so schreite ich auf dem Gedankenweg von Stufe zu 
Stufe.“ 
die konkrete Form der Darstellung, so würde ihm das 
Künstlerische am Bild, das „Sprechen“ des Bildes entge-
hen. Es muss also noch etwas anderes in ihm vorgehen, 
und das bedeutet zugleich, dass er „mehr“ als die bloße 
Form der mit den Sinnen wahrgenommenen Zeichnung 
erblickt. Wittgenstein spricht von einem „Erleben“ des Bil-
des, das ihn erfasst und ihm aus unerklärlichen Gründen 
sofort vertraut ist, „wohlbekannt“, so dass er in seinem An-
blick „ruht“. Hier könnte man nicht zu Unrecht von einer 
ästhetischen Kontemplation sprechen, einem Aufgehen im 
angeschauten Objekt, was ein Loslösen des betrachten-
den Subjekts von seinem Ego und damit eine ethische 
Dimension impliziert, wie sie Schopenhauer in der ästheti-
schen Betrachtung beschreibt und wie sie bei Wittgenstein 
in früheren Jahren anzutreffen ist.
3 Was Wittgenstein nun 
im Bild erkennt, darf zwar nicht als Idee im Sinne Platons 
definiert werden, doch ist es mehr als das rein sinnlich 
Wahrgenommene, mehr als die konkrete, äußere Form der 
Darstellung. Das von ihm beschriebene Erlebnis des un-
mittelbaren Verstehens eines Kunstwerks könnte demnach 
als ein ästhetisch-kontemplatives gesehen werden, ein 
intuitives Erlebnis, in dem Gefühl und Intellekt zusammen-
wirken. 
An anderer Stelle spricht Wittgenstein von den verschie-
denen Elementen eines Erlebnisses bzw. einem „zusam-
mengesetzten Erlebnis“ – dem des Wahrnehmens einzel-
ner Striche und dem des Erkennens der Darstellung des 
Bildes, z.B. des Gesichts in einer Zeichnung, wobei die 
Wahrnehmung des Ausdrucks, z.B. eines traurigen, einen 
weiteren Schritt – ein weiteres Erlebnis in der Betrachtung 
– bedeutet. (Vgl. BB, 259) 
Um sinnvoll zu sagen, was man sehe, müsse man das, 
was man sehe, für sich sprechen lassen. „Es scheint, als 
ob die Farbe, die ich sehe, ihre eigene Beschreibung sei.“ 
(BB, 268) 
Was man sieht oder fühlt, trete in unseren Satz ein, „wie 
ein Muster“, von dem jedoch kein Gebrauch gemacht wird, 
d.h. die Wörter unseres Satzes dienen nur dazu, uns „das 
Muster darzureichen“. (BB, 268) Denn in Wirklichkeit spre-
chen wir nicht über das, was wir sehen, sondern zu dem, 
was wir sehen. (BB, 268)  
Wenn man beim Lesen eines Satzes beeindruckt wird, 
dieser „Satz mir etwas gezeigt hat“, so sei dies mit folgen-
dem Beispiel zu vergleichen: Wittgenstein und ein Freund 
betrachteten einmal Beete mit Stiefmütterchen, von denen 
jedes eine andere Art zeigte und beeindruckte. Der Freund 
bemerkte dazu: “Was für eine Vielfalt von Farbenmustern, 
und ein jedes sagt etwas.“ (BB, 270) Dies sei genau das 
gewesen, was auch Wittgensteins sagen wollte.  
Wesentlich ist der „Eindruck“ – doch er lässt sich nicht 
ansehen, sondern ergibt sich durch aufmerksames 
Schauen bzw. Betrachten – von Farben oder Bildern.  
In diesen Beispielen, wo für Wittgenstein die Bilder oder 
Farben für sich selbst sprechen bzw. auf den Geist des 
Betrachters „hereinfallen“, kann in ähnlicher Weise ein sich 
Versenken des Betrachters im angeschauten Objekt kons-
tatiert werden, wenn auch das Objekt die „aktive Rolle“ zu 
übernehmen scheint, indem es aus sich spricht, auf den 
Betrachter wirkt. 
Insofern bedeutet das „Erlebnis“ des Bildes, wie es Witt-
genstein nennt, zwar das Sprechen, die Mitteilung des Bil-
des, dies wäre aber ohne einen inneren Erlebnisvorgang 
im Betrachter nicht möglich. Im Gegenteil, der Betrachter 
                                                      
3 Vgl. dazu das Beispiel vom „kontemplierten Ofen“, der zu seiner Welt wird. 
(TB, 8.10.1916) 

„Denk nicht, sondern schau!“ Intuitive versus rationale Betrachtung bei Wittgenstein | Ilse Somavilla 
 
 
 270
selbst muss – von sich ausgehend – erst das „Leben“ und 
damit das „Erlebnis“ des Bildes entdecken und dies setzt 
Einfühlungsvermögen, Intuition, Phantasie und Intellekt 
voraus.  
Rationale versus intuitive Betrachtung liegt auf derselben 
Ebene wie Sagen und Zeigen, wobei letztere den Aspekt 
des Schweigens berührt – dies insbesondere im Hinblick 
auf Bereiche, die durch Denken nie und nimmer erreicht 
werden können. 
Bereits Schopenhauer kritisierte Kant hinsichtlich dessen 
Auseinandersetzung mit dem Ding an sich – insofern, als 
Kant dabei die erste Form der Vorstellung, die des Ob-
jektseins für ein Subjekt, beibehalten hätte, während das 
Ding an sich nicht einmal vorstellbar sei. Im Gegensatz zu 
Kant, der sich – trotz der Anerkennung der Grenzen der 
Vernunft – dem Ding an sich wie auch dem Glauben durch 
rationale Analyse zu nähern suchte, vermied es Wittgen-
stein von Anfang an, sich mit solchen Fragen in der Philo-
sophie überhaupt zu beschäftigen, da seiner Meinung 
nach die Metaphysik innerhalb philosophischer Dispute 
nichts verloren hätte. Stattdessen wies er auf andere We-
ge oder Möglichkeiten hin, sich diesen Problemen zu nä-
hern – Wege des Zeigens intuitiver oder künstlerischer Art. 
Tolstoi und Dostojewski, z.B., zählte er zu den wenigen 
Autoren des 20. Jahrhunderts, die zum Thema Religion 
„wirklich etwas Wichtiges“ zu sagen hatten, nämlich durch 
anschauliche Darstellung von Lebenssituationen, nicht 
durch abstrakte Theorien. (Vgl. Drury 1992, 129) 
Bei aller Wertschätzung dieser nicht rationalen Zugänge 
zu letzten Fragen, sowie der Sehnsucht, einen Weg dahin 
zu finden, sah er sich selbst dazu nicht fähig. Er sei ein 
„Denker“ und käme an die Probleme des Lebens nur durch 
das Denken, schrieb er einmal an Arvid Sjögren. (9.10.47). 
Mit dem Denken könne man eine Art religiöses Wissen 
oder Verständnis erreichen, doch um Religion zu besitzen, 
brauche es andere Wege, d.h. Hilfsbereitschaft, Uneigen-
nützigkeit, Einsichtigkeit  – kurz, eine Lebensweise, die zu 
eigentlicher Religiosität führe. 
Und doch: Zahlreiche Bemerkungen in seinen Tagebü-
chern verraten eine intuitive Annäherung an Fragen der 
Ethik und Religion, ohne des Versuchs, diese auf rationale 
Weise zu begreifen und erklären oder gar zu begründen.

Wittgenstein and Early Chinese Philosophy 
Kirill Ole Thompson 
Taipeh, Taiwan | ktviking@gmail.com  
Abstract 
The present essay is not the attempt to directly compare Wittgenstein’s philosophic ideas, reflections, or practices with exam-
ples of philosophic thought and practice in early China. Rather, the concern is to discuss the application of later Wittgensteinean 
approaches in the attempt to rethink some problematic passages in early Chinese philosophy texts. The demonstrated applica-
bility of Wittgenstein’s later approaches to these problematic passages reveals the presence of some “deep disquietudes” in 
early China thought regarding the significance and implications of language and thought.   These disquietudes tend not to be 
addressed using standard textual analysis.  The present paper shows problems that arise with the human tendency simultane-
ously to codify language rigorously as an instrument to express semantically reducible statements about facts in the world while 
forgetting that the capacity and impulse to use language is “written into” the homo sapiens, which uses language for manifold 
purposes and for whom language is “a form of life.” In both Wittgenstein and early Chinese thought, a sort of questioning if not 
confrontation is evident between two ways of understanding thought and language, one that stresses reference and inference 
and another that stresses language use in the stream of life.   Going deeper, we note that the two ways also depend on each 
other for deeper understanding and a fuller picture.  As Wittgenstein writes in “Preface” to the PI (1958, 2e), the old Tractarian 
thoughts should be published together with the new ones, for “the latter could be seen in the right light only by contrast with and 
against the background of my old way of thinking.”  The new way of thinking still needs to be ballasted in the old, as a sort of 
reality check. 
 
 
I. Introduction 
The present essay views problematic passages in early 
Chinese thought in a Wittgensteinean light.  This light re-
veals “deep disquietudes” in early Chinese philosophy re-
garding language and thought.   Hence, in effect, the es-
say explores problems that arise with the human tendency 
to set language apart as talking about facts while forgetting 
that humanity uses language for manifold purposes in the 
stream of life. 
II. “A white horse is not a horse” Gongsun 
Long 
The Treatise on the White Horse is a debate whether, “A 
white horse is not a horse.”
1  The author Gongsun Long 
(hereafter GL), who accepts the proposition, pits himself 
against a Mohist logician (hereafter ML) who does not.  
Readers tend to focus on the proposition, and think of a 
white horse as a member of the class of all horses, surmis-
ing that GL regards the class of white horses as “different,” 
as it is the intersection between the classes of white things 
and horses.  However, reading the debate, it comes clear 
that the point lies elsewhere: GL is talking about words 
and language use while ML is talking about horses and 
colors.  GL focuses on "white horse" and "horse" while ML 
speaks of white horses and horses. When ML does con-
sider the terms as such, he views them as determining 
their objects in an implicit judgment.
2 
GL first argues that the proposition is acceptable on the 
basis of the significations of the terms: Since "horse" is 
color-neutral, it differs from "white horse." He then appeals 
to the communicative functions of the two terms, and what 
they discriminate. If these two terms were the same, they 
would pick out the same things.  ML then criticizes that GL 
has combined "white" and "horse" to form an illicit com-
pound, "white horse," which entails the existence of a 
mixed entity as a natural kind. GL responds that people 
create compound terms whenever a general term does not 
                                                      
1 This section is a summation of Thompson 1995. 
2 That is, he over-determines their meaning and function in use. 
answer to their needs. In a final counterpoint, ML again 
speaks of horses, colors, and judgments about them: 
"Having a white horse, one cannot state there is 'no horse,' 
because when we separate out the term 'white' the term 
'horse' remains." Thus, "the reason why we take it to be a 
'horse' cannot be just because we call a horse a 'horse.'" 
In response, GL observes that we do not use "horse" to 
select horses on the basis of color; but we use "white 
horse" to select horses to do so. Since "white horse" dis-
criminates what "horse" does not, "a 'white horse' is not a 
'horse’." 
 
Significance of the White Horse Paradox 
The paradox and debate underscore differences between 
words in the context of mention vs. the context of use. 
They thus shed light on how words and phrases operate 
by considering them in the context of mention, and they 
reinforce the instrumental value of words.  In the debate, it 
comes clear that, although ML’s claim appears to be sen-
sible at first, GL's view yields a more accurate account of 
the word use, and ML’s view looks increasingly artificial.  
The paradox and debate reveal the artificiality of “logicians' 
stencils” (Ryle 1966, 6).  These points all dovetail with 
Wittgenstein's dictum that the meaning of a word is a func-
tion of its use in language, not just a function of its sense 
and reference.3 Unfortunately, GL's key teachings were not 
transmitted beyond his school, and over time his works 
became fragmented and, in places, indecipherable. Had 
they been understood aright, they might have had a salu-
tary effect on the early development of Chinese logic and 
philosophy.  
                                                      
3 In his later thought, Wittgenstein "displayed a movement away from focusing 
on forms of expressions and their patterns of relationship towards concentrat-
ing on uses--away from viewing discourse as a patterned array of symbols 
towards seeing speech as part of the web of human life, interwoven with a 
multitude of acts, activities, reactions and responses" (Baker and Hacker 
1985, 39). For instance, in PI par. 43, Wittgenstein writes: "For a large class of 
cases . . . in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the 
meaning of a word is its use in the language." And Norman Malcolm records 
Wittgenstein as saying, "An expression only has meaning in the stream of life" 
(Malcolm 1958,. 93). A vast literature exists on Wittgenstein's seminal idea 
that meaning is use.

III. Goblet Words 
Zhuangzi introduces the idea of “goblet words” in chapter 
27.
4  “Goblet words” are a method of persuasion that con-
trasts with “imputed words” and “repeated words.”  “Im-
puted words” are used when one’s own words might not 
be trusted by others.  Second, when people caught up in 
disputes with no end in sight, they invoke “repeated words” 
“to put an end to the argument. They work because they 
are the words of elders.”  The effectiveness of one’s uses 
of imputed words and repeated words depend on the 
speaker’s closeness to the case, interest in the case, and 
grasp of the flow of events.  What distinguishes goblet 
words is that while the others are used to talk about a mat-
ter, goblet words become implicated with the matter.   This 
is the distinction between holding words over against real-
ity, and uttering words in the flux of events.5  Rather than 
indicating abstract categories, under which things and 
events are judged to fall, etc.; goblet words are used as 
tools of conversing and of managing the nexus of events.6  
Behind this lies the view that we don’t simply identify and 
characterize things according to a static framework. We 
are actively involved in life and deem and determine and 
make and shape things as we engage life all the time.
  
“Goblet words” highlight the idea of flexible response to 
life situations. The goblet words are tools in the mouths of 
the “enlightened” in navigating life and “opening up” oth-
ers.
13 
Navigating life here is reminiscent of other Zhuan-
gian characters, such as Cook Ting wielding his cleaver to 
deftly dissect a back of beef in Ch.3; Wheelwright Pian 
wielding his mallet and chisel to chisel a wheel from rough 
stone in Ch. 13; and the swimmer deftly handling the boat 
in light of the current in Ch. 19.  
IV.  The Happiness of the Fish 
At this point, I present an anecdote from Zhuangzi:
7 
The Happiness of the Fish, Zhuangzi, ch. 17 
Zhuangzi and Hui Shi rambled freely atop the abutment 
over the river Hao.  
Zhuangzi exclaimed, “The fish swim out and about and 
‘ramble’ as carefree as they please.  This is fish happi-
ness.”  
Huizi replied, “You’re not a fish; how do you know fish’s 
happiness?”  
Zhuangzi returned, “You’re not me; how do you know 
that I don’t know fish’s happiness?”  
Huizi said “I am not you and I certainly don’t know what 
you know. But, you are even more certainly not a fish; 
that you do not know the fish’s happiness is complete.”  
Zhuangzi said, “Let’s get back to your original question. 
When you said ‘How (and whence) do you know fish 
happiness?’ You asked me because you already knew 
that I know fish’s happiness. I know it here, on the 
abutment, over the river Hao.”

4 This section is a condensation of Thompson 2007. 
5 I would like to say that these goblet words are thus somehow “performative.”  
6 13 On words as tools, see Wittgenstein 1958, 6e7e, #11 and #12, where he 
writes, for instance: “Think of the tools in a toolbox, there is a hammer, a pli-
ers, a saw, a screwdriver, a ruler, a gluepot, glue, nails and screws. The func-
tions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both 
cases there are similarities.)… Of course, what confuses us is the uniform 
appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and 
print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially when 
we are doing philosophy!”  
7 This section is a condensation of Thompson ms (2014). 
8 Translation adapted from a draft translation by the eminent Chinese philoso-
pher Roger Ames. 
This debate is not whether “the fish are happy” but 
whether Zhuangzi can claim to know it.   Note that in his 
initial observation he does not say “he knows that the fish 
are happy” but just observes that they are.  Also, he does 
not predicate happiness of the fish but registers that “they 
are exhibiting” “fish-happiness.”   The verb know is not 
used, since a la Wittgenstein, we use know only when 
there might be doubt and need to account for one’s claim.    
Hui Shi takes this observation as a claim to know the fish 
are happy, and requests Zhuangzi’s grounds for knowing.   
Zhuangzi calls Hui Shi’s bluff saying he has no right to say 
he knows that “I don’t know the fish’s happiness.”  Hui Shi 
admits that he does not know what Zhuangzi knows, but 
again asserts that Zhuangzi can’t know the fish’s happi-
ness.  Many take Zhuangzi’s reply to this as disingenuous.  
He teases that Hui Shi’s original question had presumed 
that he did know  (“How do you know…?”).  Second, 
Zhuangzi avers that he knows it “from here on the abut-
ment over the river Hao.”9 
What is going on?  First, Hui Shi is insisting that literally 
Zhuangzi cannot know it on the basis of strict truth condi-
tions.   This harnesses him to the other minds problem.  
Zhuangzi’s implicit notion of truth criteria is more in keep-
ing with common usage than Hui Shi’s, i.e.,  Zhuangzi ob-
serves the fish capering about —such is the happiness of 
the fish.   Moreover, Hui Shi’s admission about not know-
ing other people’s minds is not so certain.  We know each 
other’s minds quite well through our daily intercourse.  The 
entire exchange reflects Zhuangzi’s knowledge of Hui Shi.  
Zhuangzi knows his initial statement will prompt Hui Shi’s 
response, so the exchange manifests a denial of Hui Shi’s 
contention that we cannot know each other’s minds.  
As to Zhuangzi’s truth conditions for affirming the fish’s 
happiness, one is reminded of Wittgenstein’s “inner proc-
esses stand in need of outer criteria” (PI 1951, #580) and 
discussions on pain language.  The fish behavior provides 
ample evidence for saying they are happy.  Zhuangzi ex-
plores this issue from other angles throughout the 
Zhuangzi. 
V.  Conclusion  
In closing, let us consider several passages wherein 
Zhuangzi raises issues of knowledge and certainty with a 
Wittgensteinean twist. First, from chapter 2: 
Joy, anger grief, delight, worry, regret, fickleness, in-
flexibility, modesty, willfulness, candor, insolence—
music from empty holes, mushrooms springing up in 
dampness, day and night replacing each other before 
us, and no one knows where they sprout from…. morn-
ing and evening, we have [emotions], they are the 
means by which we live.  Without them, we would not 
exist, without us they would have nothing to take hold 
of.  This comes close to the matter.  But I do not know 
what makes them the way they are… 
The hundred joints, the nine openings, the six organs, 
come together and exist here [as my body]. But which 
part should I feel closest to? I should delight in all parts, 
you say? But there must be one I ought to favor more. If 
not, are they all of them mere servants?  But if they are 
all servants, then how can they keep order among 
themselves?  Or do they take turns being lord and ser-
vant?  …(Watson 1968, 32-33). 
                                                      
9 “From here” is a witticism, since Hui Shi’s “How do you know?” is literally 
“Whence do you?” or “From where do you know?”

Second, from chapter 6, how much of what we think we 
know do we actually “know”?: 
He who knows what it is that Heaven (nature, instinct) 
does, and knows what it is that man does, has reached 
the peak. Knowing what it is that Heaven does, he lives 
with Heaven.  Knowing what it is that man does, he 
uses the knowledge of what he knows to help out the 
knowledge of what he does not know, and lives out the 
years that Heaven gave him without being cut off mid-
way—this is the perfection of knowledge. 
However, there is a difficulty. Knowledge must wait for 
something to fix on to, and that which it waits for is 
never certain. How, then, can I know what I call Heaven 
is not really man, and what I call man is not really 
Heaven? There must be a True Man before there can 
be true knowledge (Watson 1968, 73). 
Some follow up from chapter 17:  
“It is said: the Heavenly is on the inside, the human is 
on the outside.  Virtus resides in the Heavenly. Under-
stand the actions of Heaven and man, base yourself on 
Heaven and take your stand in Virtue, and then al-
though you hasten or hold back, bend or stretch, you 
may return to the essential and speak of the ultimate.” 
  “What do you mean by the Heavenly and the human?” 
“Horses and oxen have four feet—that is what I mean 
by the Heavenly.  Putting a halter on a horse’s head 
and piercing an ox’s nose—this is what I mean by the 
human.  So I say: do not let what is human wipe out 
what is Heavenly; do not let the purposeful wipe out 
what is fated; do not let [the desire for gain] lead you af-
ter fame. Be cautious, guard it, and do not lose it—this 
is what I mean by returning to the True” (Watson 1968, 
104). 
In what ways do these passages resonate with the thought 
of Wittgenstein?  First,  the later Wittgenstein seeks to free 
us from the model of the human being as essentially a de-
liberate, thinking, willing being, and toward more a feeling, 
instinctive, bio-cultural being.  Often, it is not easy to dis-
tangle the strands of “willing subject” from the diverse and 
instinctive repertoire of human thought and action.  Sec-
ond, the later Wittgenstein of OC also notes the difficulty of 
distangling the sorts of things we instinctively take for 
granted in thought and language from those that we delib-
erately think about and question.  We are largely unaware 
of this-- until we are challenged to prove or support this or 
that.  Also, there is a subterranean body of knowledge or 
awareness that is instinctual.  Consider our understanding 
of “balance.”  How much of it comes from books?  How 
much of it comes from experience-- and instinct?  How 
much are we aware of—until the moment we lose our bal-
ance?   We imagine we are fully conscious and in charge 
of our language and conduct, but often we feel surprised to 
see candid recordings of ourselves.  Third, as to the dis-
tinction the Heavenly (natural) and the human, the later 
Wittgenstein questions overly formalized ways of thinking 
bereft of any sense of feelings and the stream of human 
life.   The promise of such thinking at the same time bears 
great risk of dehumanizing people. 
Wittgenstein and the Chinese both ponder the distinction 
between understanding thought and language in terms of 
reference and inference vs. the stream of life. Going 
deeper, we note that the two ways also depend on each 
other for understanding. Zhuangzi needs Hui Shi for clari-
fying and discerning his view, as Hui Shi needs Zhuangzi 
to tease open the narrow parameters of his thinking. To-
gether, there is the possibility of fuller comprehension.  
Similarly, in “Preface” to the PI (1958, 2e), Wittgenstein 
writes: 
Four years ago I had occasion to re-read my first book 
(the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus) and to explain its 
ideas to someone. It suddenly seemed to me that I 
should publish those old thoughts and the new ones to-
gether: that the latter could be seen in the right light 
only by contrast with and against the background of my 
old way of thinking.  
Wittgenstein’s new way of thinking still needs to be viewed 
against the old.10 Zhuangzi still needs to temper his flights 
of thought and insight by answering Hui Shi’s sharp ques-
tioning.

Wittgenstein’s On Certainty and Necessary Truths in Jurisprudence 
Yi Tong 
Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, USA | tongx071@umn.edu 
Abstract 
One of the central characteristics of general theories of law in contemporary analytical jurisprudence is that they make claims of 
necessity. Famously, Joseph Raz developed his version of legal positivism based on the claim that law necessarily claims le-
gitimate authority. However, the nature and grounds of such claims seldom receive clarification. In light of recent criticisms of 
unreflective recourse to claims of necessity in discussions of philosophical methodology, necessity claims in legal theory are in 
need of explicit defense. In this paper, I argue that necessity claims in legal theory can be understood in a Wittgensteinian spirit. 
In particular, Wittgenstein’s thoughts on “hinge propositions” in On Certainty provide us with insights into understanding i) ne-
cessity as grounded in our actions and practices and ii) contingent necessity, i.e. necessary truths relative to a discourse or in-
quiry that change over time. 
 
 
1. Introduction: Necessary Truths in Con-
temporary Analytical Jurisprudence 
A cursory survey of literature in contemporary analytical 
jurisprudence shows that the talk of necessity in general 
theories of law is pervasive. Julie Dickson, for example, 
holds that a successful theory of law “consists of proposi-
tions about the law which i) are necessarily true, and ii) 
adequately explain the nature of law” (Dickson 2001, 17). 
Scott Shapiro writes in a similar sprit, “to discover the law’s 
nature…would be in part to discover the necessary proper-
ties, that is, those properties that law could not fail to have” 
(Shapiro 2011, 9). Writers in general jurisprudence all 
seem to share Joseph Raz’s pronouncement in the essay 
“On the Nature of Law”: “A claim to necessity is in the na-
ture of the enterprise [of the general theory of law]” (Raz 
1996, 2).  
In recent years, however, claims to necessity have been 
subject to severe criticism in discussions of methodological 
issues in jurisprudence. For example, Dennis Patterson 
gives three reasons why unreflective recourse to claims of 
necessity is problematic: Quine’s critique of the analytic-
synthetic distinction, that the so-called “experimental phi-
losophy” demonstrates widespread divergence in linguistic 
intuitions and that there is a “catalog of monumental fail-
ures of conceptual analysis” (Patterson 2011). Upon reflec-
tion, the nature of necessity in jurisprudence seems to be 
a puzzle independently: can we legitimately speak of “nec-
essary truths” in theorizing about a human institution and 
social practice that change over time? If so, what makes 
them necessary? (cf. Bix 2003).  
My proposal in this paper is that we can begin to defend 
necessity claims in legal theory by looking at them in a 
Wittgensteinian spirit. I argue that certain aspects of Witt-
genstein’s thoughts in On Certainty could be used to shed 
light on the nature of necessity in jurisprudence. I suggest 
that the kind of necessity in jurisprudence are not analytic 
or logic truths, or truth across all possible worlds, but 
rather can be seen as grounded in a community’s prac-
tices and way of life that are historically contingent. My 
investigation will start with a discussion of Wittgenstein’s 
ideas of hinges in On Certainty. Several insights will then 
be drawn from this discussion to connect with a necessity 
claim in Raz’s theory of law. I conclude with a general note 
on the historical aspect of necessary truths in legal theo-
ries.  
2. Hinges and their Grounding in Wittgen-
stein’s On Certainty 
As is well known, the starting point of Wittgenstein’s inquiry 
was his interest in certain propositions that the philosopher 
G.E. Moore claims to know with unquestionable certainty, 
such as “Here is one hand, and here is another”, and “The 
earth existed for a long time before my birth”, and “I have 
never been far from the earth’s surface”.1 For my pur-
poses, I will focus on discussing Wittgenstein’s examina-
tion of the proposition “The earth existed for a long time 
before my birth” at OC 84 and some of what I take to be 
his central insights.  
Wittgenstein points out that that Moore or anyone else 
knows this is uninteresting. However, “it is interesting that, 
and how, it can be known.” We do not, for example, make 
special investigations to arrive at this conclusion (OC 84, 
134). A geologist might investigate into the exact age of 
the earth, but not whether it started to exist, for example, 
10 years ago. Wittgenstein is making a logical point here: if 
we were even uncertain about whether the earth has ex-
isted for a long time before my birth, and need special in-
vestigations to assemble evidence for this conclusion, it is 
unclear whether the evidence could be any surer than the 
conclusion (cf. OC 111). A piece of evidence needs to be 
more certain than what it is evidence for. This shows that 
Moore’s proposition requires a different kind of grounding, 
not in the usual sense of providing evidence for them.  
But everything in my life seems to point to the fact that 
the earth has existed a long time before my birth: that I 
know of my grand parents and ancestors, that I have seen 
fossil records of ancient animals and I have learned that 
fossil formation takes a significant passage of time, etc. 
The “everything I have seen and heard” forms a system, or 
what a Wittgenstein calls a world picture (Weltbild). “Noth-
ing in my picture of the world speaks in favor of the oppo-
site” (OC 93). Wittgenstein calls a belief such as “the earth 
has existed a long time before my birth” a “hinge” in a 
world picture. Hinges are exempt from doubt because 
doubting it would make such a doubt unintelligible (OC 
341).2  
It follows that “what lies around [a hinge]” matters a lot 
when we think about hinges (cf. OC 144). Just like a door 
                                                      
1 See On Certainty, preface (Abbreviated as “OC” below. Reference to On 
Certainty will be “OC” followed by a section number). A more detailed list of 
Moore’s propositions can be found in Moore’s original papers (A defense of 
Common Sense” (1925) and “Proof of the External World”(1939)). 
2 There is no space for a detailed discussion of this point. My discussion in 
section 3 expounds this point a bit further.

hinge, the door’s movement around it determines that it 
needs to be immobile (cf. OC 152). Wittgenstein makes a 
further point: what stand fast and what are likely to shift are 
not in a relation of one being the foundation of the others, 
but rather they give each other mutual support (cf. OC 
142). As per earlier discussion, a hinge belief is not de-
duced from “what lies around it”, but nor is it the prior 
foundation based on which we get other beliefs in our 
world picture. There is a sense that the surrounding beliefs 
do support the hinge belief in that “the opposite hypothesis 
has nothing on its side”. A metaphor recapitulates Wittgen-
stein’s thought here: [O]ne might almost say that these 
foundation-walls are carried by the whole house (OC 248). 
The house itself contributes to the stability of the whole 
structure.  
If we could talk about the grounding of a hinge at all, the 
ground is not any further clear and distinct beliefs, but 
consists in the fact that hinge beliefs are interwoven into 
our ways of acting (OC 204). It is a recurrent theme in 
Wittgenstein’s philosophy that justification for our beliefs 
comes to an end, and the end is not some foundational 
belief but rather how we act (cf. Philosophical Investiga-
tions 217). For hinge beliefs, we cannot offer any further 
justification other than pointing out that how we act shows 
that we believe such and such. Moyal-Sharrock calls this 
“the enacted nature” of foundational beliefs (Sharrock 
2004, 97). Hinges such as that I live in address A (OC 70), 
that the earth is of such a shape (OC 147), that there is the 
island Australia (OC 159), trees don’t change into men vice 
versa (OC 513), are all interwoven into human activities 
such as going to work and back home, planning trips, 
booking flight tickets, making phone calls, cutting down 
trees, seeking help from people (rather than trees), etc. 
Hinge beliefs are manifested in our actions. They are re-
vealed in how we act, and they tell us what we believe.  
However, that the hinges are exempt from doubt and are 
grounded in our ways of acting does not mean that they 
will be the same cross time and culture. What is a hinge 
and what is not is a matter of historical contingency. A king 
in a tribe might be brought up believing that the world be-
gan with him and hold it as a hinge belief (OC 92). And the 
role this belief assumes might undergo change. “The river-
bed of thoughts may shift” (OC 97). Yet we distinguish 
those bedrock beliefs and those that rest on them (OC 96). 
3. Hinge Propositions and Necessity in 
Raz’s Theory  
I think the brief discussion above will be helpful for under-
standing a necessity claim in Raz’s legal theory. Let me 
start with a correspondence, coincidental or not, between 
Raz’s writing and Wittgenstein’s text. Raz’s argument for 
his legal theory begins thus: “I will assume that necessarily 
law, every legal system which is in force anywhere, has de 
facto authority. That entails that the law either claims that it 
possesses legitimate authority or is held to possess it” 
(Raz 1994, 199). From this claim, Raz develops his ver-
sion of exclusive legal positivism. It is not the purpose of 
this paper to enter into a discussion of Raz’s version of 
positivism. What strikes me as most interesting is that Raz 
could assume such a necessity claim. Indeed, Raz does 
not even set the ground for this claim with prior arguments, 
nor does he support it with any independent, further argu-
ments. A passage in On Certainty responds to this obser-
vation: 
If I say “we assume that the earth has existed for many 
years past” (or something similar), then of course it 
sounds strange that we should assume such a thing. 
But in the entire system of our language-game it be-
longs to the foundations. The assumption, one might 
say, forms the basis of action, and therefore, naturally, 
of thought (OC 411, original emphasis).  
Wittgenstein’s thought is that a hinge belief can be as-
sumed in the sense that for our other enquiries and asser-
tions to be intelligible, this proposition has to be exempted 
from doubt. Denying it would mean toppling all other judg-
ments around it (OC 419). Now, the reason Raz can as-
sume the necessity claim is exactly that that law claims 
authority lies at the foundation of our legal discourses and 
practices. Court decisions, various legal procedures, rules 
and precedents, legal obligations etc., as well as our un-
derstanding of them, depend on this in the sense that for 
these institutions to be what we understand them to be, 
that law claims authority has to be assumed. These legal 
institutions will make no sense to us or will work very dif-
ferently if this proposition is denied. On the other hand, the 
existence of these legal institutions and our understanding 
of them point to the fact that law claims authority, while its 
opposite has nothing on its side (cf. OC 190).  
The claim that law claims authority is not validated via a 
further argument, not because we cannot, but because it is 
not something we could argue for. We have reached the 
bedrock of our reasoning. Even if we were able to produce 
arguments for it, they will not be more evident than the 
conclusion that law claims authority. Such a claim is rather 
grounded in the way our legal institutions operate, in our 
ways of acting or being conditioned to act in relation to 
those legal institutions. However, we can describe the 
manifestations of such a claim. Raz writes: 
The claims the law makes for itself are evident from the 
language it adopts and from the opinions expressed by 
its spokesmen, i.e. by the institutions of the law. The 
law’s claim to authority is manifested by the fact that le-
gal institutions are officially designated as “authorities”, 
by the fact that they regard themselves as having the 
right to impose obligations on their subjects, by the 
claims that their subjects owe them allegiance, and that 
their subjects ought to obey the law as it requires to be 
obeyed (Raz 1994, 199-200).  
Raz does not offer this as a proof or argument, but rather 
as a description of how legal agents talk and behave, how 
legal institutions function. In Wittgenstein’s language, the 
way the legal practices operate shows that the law claims 
authority (cf. OC 7). This is part of what grounds the ne-
cessity claim Raz makes. Raz supports his claim with a 
mere description, but he is justified to do so. There is noth-
ing else we can offer to support the claim that law neces-
sarily claims authority, but a description of the legal prac-
tice, our attitude toward it and understanding of it.  
4. Concluding Remarks: Parochialism and 
Contingent Necessity 
Raz argues that our concept of law and hence a general 
theory of law is parochial in the sense that it is produced 
by a particular culture or society at a particular time in his-
tory (Raz 1996). This gives rise to a question: how can we 
obtain necessary truths from a concept that is parochial? A 
Wittgensteinian view is helpful here. The concept of law, 
the one that modern Western society has, is a product of a 
specific culture over a specific time period. It is therefore 
imbedded in and is part of a particular world-picture. But in 
this world picture, that law claims authority is like a hinge in 
our legal discourses and practices. The claim therefore is 
both necessary and parochial.

A world-picture might entail a totally different concept of 
law, e.g. a world picture in which law does not claim au-
thority, or law does not involve coercion. In order to under-
stand that world-picture, we will be “brought to look at the 
world in a different way” (OC 92). Law in our own world 
picture has undergone significant changes. A case in point 
is the change from John Austin’s fundamental idea that 
law is the command of the sovereign to H.L.A. Hart’s cen-
tral thought that law is a system of rules. It is not merely a 
theoretical innovation, but also an expression of the ideal 
of “the rule of law and not of men” in modern democratic 
societies.

A Formal Theory of Value 
Grzegorz & Renata Trela 
Cracow, Poland | trelok@gmail.com 
Abstract 
In the paper we show how to following line with the intentions of polish logician – a member of Lwov-Warsaw School – Tadeusz 
Czeżowski, and staying at the position Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus and his ontology, we can create rational and formal the-
ory of values. In this theory we understanding values as objective property relation between object and knowing subject. This 
concept of formal theory of values give us instrument or tool to compare irrelevant tradition of understanding relation between 
fact and values as algebraic aspect and consequence theory of relation. We have hope that this conception can give assump-
tion to the new way of understanding and interpreting traditional (not only) axiological dilemma, but also new interpretation Witt-
genstein logical atomism. 
 
 
In line with the intentions of Tadeusz Czeżowski1, We will 
take value as a relative attribute of an object: an object is 
valued for a subject a because of p. In all kinds of publica-
tions dedicated to defining conditions, under which a given 
object a is attributed a value, two instances occur in each 
such situation: 
a) There is a subject s for which the object a has a 
value, 
b) There is an object p because of which object a has a 
value because it remains in a certain relationship to it. 
(0.1) Object a has a value when there is a valuing ob-
ject s, the parameter valuing p and the basic relation-
ship R: a R p 
In other words, for an object to have a value, somebody 
must exist, who values it, who desires it. This element, for 
which the value exists, is usually called the valuing object: 
it can be a human individual, in a wider meaning - a group 
of people, a nation, society and even humankind.  
The parameter value p is the object (attribute), which has 
a value for the object which values it. The object p, be-
cause of which object a has a value, we will call the value 
parameter, and the relationship between object a and p 
the basic relationship. A parameter can be any object 
(really existing or a certain ideal), which on its part has a 
value for the valuing object, or also the valuing object itself 
(e.g. a design for a work of art or scientific rationalisation).  
The fundamental relation R which exists between the ob-
ject a and the parameter determines the added or adverse 
value of object a. A certain object has a value, if it has a 
fundamental relation to some parameter. Because a pa-
rameter can be any object and because a fundamental 
relation many relationships, therefore in further considera-
tions, when a given object p, remaining in a relation R to 
object p, it will be sufficient to assume, that R is the fun-
damental relationship, p the parameter, to be able to talk 
about the value of the object. 
(0.2) 
A given object has a value eq
2 when it has a 
value-creating relation to some parameter. 
The expression a R p has the following meaning: let a 
be a certain individual object, Let R be a variable rela-
tionship in a chosen scope (R), let p identify any given 
                                                      
1 Tadeusz Czeżowski -  wrote three articles dedicated to formal properties of 
values. All three articles were published in: [Czeżowski 1989]. 
2 eq = equivalence 
object. We introduce the symbol W(a), which we read 
as „the value of object a” and hence:  
(1)  W(a) = {R  R: a R p} 
Which means: the value of object a arising from a certain 
parameter p remains in a certain relationship R (the fun-
damental relationship to the given parameter). Conse-
quently equation (1) is equivalent to:  
(2)  W(a1)=W(a2) when {R  R: a1 R p} = {R  R: a2 R p} 
Similarly we can define the lesser (greater) relationship of 
two values: 
(3)  W(a1)<W(a2) when {R  R: a1 R p}  {R  R: a2 R p} 
Definitions (2) and (3) allow the comparison only of such 
values a1 and a2, that sets satisfied by their fundamental 
relationships are equal or one of them contains the other. 
If these sets are not inclusive, the values cannot be com-
pared. The values cannot be compared always when both 
differences are simultaneously not void:  {R R: a1 R p} - 
{R  R: a2 R p} and  {R  R: a2 R p} - {R  R: a1 R p}. In 
such a situation when neither W(a1) = W(a2), or W(a1) < 
W(a2), or W(a2) < W(a1) - entities a1 and a2 are not com-
mon-valued (obviously for s, with reference to p and scope 
R). 
Leading to description of associations guaranteeing 
comparison of any values, Czeżowski accepts the follow-
ing postulates: (4)-(8). 
(4) For a fixed p and R there is a maximum value W(a): 
W(a)=R 
This maximum value is given to objects satisfying all rela-
tions in a given scope, or to such values which satisfy the 
minimum requirement (R) of the object valuing because of 
the given parameter; i.e., a catalogue containing all infor-
mation (which we need) about a particular topic, or model 
which perfectly satisfies all objectives and conditions 
(which we want) of exploitation etc. 
(5) For a fixed p and R there is a minimum value W(a): 
W(a)=   
An object has such a value if it does not satisfy any rela-
tion in the scope R, it is hence a value displaced by any

other comparable in the scope R, speaking simply it is a 
value which is hardly better than nothing3. 
(6) For any values W(a1) and W(a2) there exist values not 
smaller than any of them, i.e.  {W(a):W(a)  W(a1), W(a2)}  
, and the smallest among the not smaller values, is a  W (a1 
 a2) = (W(a1)  W(a2)) ={RR: a1  a2 R p} 
The identification „(a1  a2)”, denotes an object, which sat-
isfies all relations satisfied by a1 or by a2, that is  „entity” 
being the sum of values a1 and a2. When one of the con-
stituent values, say a1, is the greatest in scope R and be-
cause of parameter p, then W(a1  a2), is equal to W(a1): 
i.e. the sum jug of water  barrel of water does not have a 
greater value than the jug of water when we are talking 
about satisfying the thirst of one person.  
(7)  For any value W(a1) and W(a2) there exists a value not 
greater than any of them, i.e. . {W(a) : W(a)  W(a1), W(a2)}  
, and the highest among the not greater values is W(a1  
a2) = (W(a1)   W(a2)  ={RR : a1  a2  R p} 
The identification “a1  a2 ” it’s a kind of algebraic intersec-
tion - which denotes the product of values, or values satis-
fying the relation R, which occur simultaneously for a1 and 
a2; the product of values can be considered. Such under-
stand product of values we have i.e. when considering a 
medicine helpful for several disorders or a group of re-
sources required to achieve some objective. If the value of 
such a product is determined by the smallest value in the 
scope R, then value W(a1  a2  ...  ak) is smallest, i.e., 
equal to  (for example, if there is a shortage of nails in-
dispensable for building a house, all other materials will 
have no value if building the house is the only parameter 
of assessment).  
(8)  For all values of W(a) there is a supplementary value 
W(a'), such that:  
  (W(a)  W(a’)) = R (= W(a  a’)). 
Sum a  a’ of values a and a’ is hence the highest value, 
and their product a  a’ is the smallest value in the scope  
R. Supplementary values cannot be mutually replaced in 
any case of relations in the scope  R.  
The object a’ here satisfies all the relations in the scope 
(R), which are not satisfied by a. Opposing values (under-
stand as logical opposition)  are supplementary value type 
(in values space) such are for example, when considering 
the value of nourishment and poison in terms of maintain-
ing life, one of the opposing values has a positive identifi-
cation and the other a negative. 
When we have given values in a given scope, it is possi-
ble to create a series of scopes lying within R, so that 
every preceding one fits into the next one, and when we 
add the zero scope (0) as the first element, and the scope 
itself (R) as the last; we can identify the series thus ob-
tained as the basic series and can label each occurrence 
with the symbol (Rx). 
(9)  The basic series
4 of the scope R is the series {Ri:  
i=1,...,k} sub scopes of the scope R, so, that Ri = , Ri  Ri+1 , 
Rk = R, i =1,...,k-1 
                                                      
3 E.g. An old car which cannot be used - still has a small market value (it is 
better than nothing) even though it does not perform its basic function- hence 
its value is close to zero.  
4 The idea of a basic series in the concept of Czeżowski enables comparison 
of goods which are not common valued. And is based on the fact, that non-
comparable goods in some scope R become comparable, when you do not 
take into account certain relations of these goods with the parameter p, or 
certain aspects in relation to p, and hence the scope R is narrowed. 
It is obvious that the basic series can be created in many 
ways, it is sufficient to select any subset of the scope R, 
arranging them in order so that each subsequent one con-
tains the previous and add a empty set as the first in the 
series and scope R as the last; if the number of the scope 
R is equal to n, then the number of such basic series for R, 
which occurrences take every number from 0 do n is equal 
to n!, it is also possible to create series which do not con-
tain all such subsets. 
It is worth clearly describing a supporting concept pro-
posed by Czeżowski, making it easier to evaluate the solu-
tion:  
(10)  If {Ri}, i=1,...k  is a basic series for the scope R, in the 
class {Ri}a= df {Rx}  {Ri} : W(a) = Rx} is a part of the series 
{Ri} satisfied fully by  a. 
The class {Ri}a hence contains all expressions Rx of the 
series {Ri}, in which good
5 has a value W(a)=Rx, i.e. satis-
fies all relations of the scopes Rx. belonging to the class of 
scopes Rx, arranged in the order in agreement with the 
arrangement of the series {Ri} creating its initial part. Using 
this idea it is easier to describe the relationship called sca-
lar equality and scalar less than. 
(11) W(a1)   W(a2) when {Ri}a1 = {Ri}a2  
  From this equation it follows directly that: 
(12)  The relationship  is reversible, symmetrical and 
transferable, it is a balanced relationship. 
  Joining (11) with (2) and using (9) and (10), we arrive at  
  the following conclusion: 
(13) If W(a1) = W(a2), then W(a1)  W(a2) (the implication of  
  the opposite is not real). 
  Analogically Czeżowski describes the scalar less than: 
(14)  W(a1) ‹W(a2) when  {Ri}a1  {Ri}a2  
The value a1 is smaller than value a2, when every scope of 
the fixed basic series {Ri}, satisfied totally by a1 is also to-
tally satisfied by a2, but not the other way round. 
The relationship of scalar equality and scalar less than 
(greater than) allows for the comparison of any two values:  
(15)  For any values a1 and a2 exactly one of two possibili-
ties is satisfied: 
  W(a1)  W(a2), W(a1) ‹ W(a2), W(a1) ›W(a2) 
Let Rm be the greatest scope of the basic series {Ri}, such, 
that a1 has in Rm the highest value, i.e.. {RR : a1 R p} = 
Rm , and Rn - the greatest scope of this series, in which the 
highest value has a2. From the definition of the basic se-
ries the result is that Rm i Rn are equal or associated by an 
inclusive relationship (9). It can be shown that: 
(i) 
if Rm = Rn, , then W(a1)  W(a2); 
(ii) 
if Rm Rn, , then W(a1 ‹ W(a2)
6. 
If however Rx  {Ri}a1 , then Rx  Rm, which in the light of 
the equation accepted in (i)  Rm = Rn means, that Rx  
{Ri}a2. In the same way we can arrive at the statement, that 
                                                      
5 In this part of the work we use the word good interchangeably with the term 
value for stylistic reasons: the formula „value having value” would not always 
sound right. Moreover to identify the idea of scalar equality we use the symbol: 
, and to identify scalar less than: ‹. 
6 Scalar inequality we mark as bold sign „inequality”.

{Ri}a2  {Ri}a1 or {Ri}a1  = {Ri}a2, which is equivalent to for-
mula (11): W(a1)  W(a2). If however  Rm  Rm , then the 
scopes of the basic series from   to Rm belong to  {Ri}a1 
and to {Ri}a2 , and the scopes from  Rm + 1 to Rm belong only 
to {Ri}a2. So {Ri)a1 {Ri}a2, or W(a1) ‹ W(a2) (14). (See 12). 
Using the properties of the scalar relationship of equality 
(12), it is possible, following Czeżowski, to introduce the 
concept of a class of abstraction of this relationship. If [ai] 
is i-th class of abstraction of the relationship  shown by 
the real value ai, then the common property of all values of 
this class (i.e. W([ai]) = W(ai )) is the  i-th value and the 
series  {W([ai]) : i = 1,2...} ordered from the smallest to the 
greatest - is the scale of values.

Facts and values in scientific theories 
Renata Trela 
Cracow, Poland | trelok@gmail.com 
Abstract 
The modern culture is greatly determined by science and its axiology. At the same time the myth is widespread  that science is 
free of any valuations. I am going to present review of most important 20th century scientific theories formulated on the ground 
of philosophy in light of values appearing in them. This compilation bears the features of idealization  which above all is the result of 
the circumstance that it is necessary, in the case of numerous concepts, to carry out a number of interpretation-related operations 
which are as always controversial in such cases,  in order to extract values which constitute their basis. I am going to discuss rela-
tionship of facts and values in apprehension of Vienna Circle and its successors from the widely apprehended logical empiri-
cism, K. Popper’s falsificationism and its successors, historical and cultural concepts of T. Kuhn, P. Feyerabend and Edinburgh 
School. This compilation will allow to formulate more general regularities of changes occurring in science and culture founded 
thereon.  
 
 
The tendency can be observed towards instrumentaliza-
tion of the scientific knowledge, which is expressed by per-
ceiving the valuable features of the knowledge not in its 
autotelic features but in its instrumental values enabling 
growth of technological efficiency. The discussed tendency 
is reflected in two other regularities: firstly, the growth of 
social significance of context of cognition which is obvi-
ously the result of ongoing institutionalization of scientific 
research and, reversibly, to its instrumentalization; sec-
ondly, gradual disappearance of values in culture space 
which have traditionally been associated with realism and 
their substituting with instrumental values which are char-
acteristic for anti-realistic approach.  
No explicit value system has been formulated on the 
ground of any scientific theory which have been consid-
ered by me, although each of theories, more or less explic-
itly, aspires to play such a role. Each of the apprehensions 
makes specific assumptions related to metaphysical-
epistemological character of the science and leads to the 
formulation of cognitive values which are valuable on the 
ground of a given theory. Then, authors formulate the as-
sessment criteria for cognition products which constitute 
realization of some determined cognitive values which 
leads values of science justifying its position in culture, to 
be accepted or rejected. 
One of the results of the paper is the confirmation of fact, 
that albeit the creators of the adopted point of view were 
mainly interested in apprehension of specific features of 
science in synchronic approach, their successors were 
interested above all in the dynamics of science, mecha-
nisms of change, i.e. the diachronic approach. In other 
words, point of view of Popper, his successors and critics 
has rather supplemented the concept of science, as 
worked out on the ground of Vienna Circle, with the issues 
related to the dynamics of scientific theories, than modified 
it.  
The compilation supports the argument that, regardless of 
existing discrepancies between particular points of view, the 
values can be shown which are accepted in any concept, i.e. 
simplicity and consistency. Criticism and accuracy are other 
values which are present in various concepts of science. All 
these values are related to traditions of rationalism, analyticity 
and logics. Presently, it is difficult to decide to which extent 
the question of a strong dissemination of these values in the-
ory of science and to which extent they constitute a specific 
„hard core” of the science which is independent of number of 
interpretations of its cultural specificity. 
Universality belongs to those values which have been mar-
ginalized in the modern philosophical thought in conse-
quence of research carried out by the science and reflections 
thereon. It is difficult to determine how constant and irreversi-
ble this tendency is. Undoubtedly, scientific theoreticians 
have never been so distrustful about scope of binding force 
of scientific theory as it is case nowadays. 
The compilation also allows to notice how floating and diffi-
cult to perceive it is in framework of the widespread and 
stereotypical philosophical interpretations of particular points 
of view, to determine distinctive features separating appropri-
ate concepts of science.  
A high position among the desired features of science ac-
knowledged by almost all concepts is occupied  by confirma-
tion principle which, combined with neopositivistic  verification 
principle and falsification principle, so widespread among the 
followers of Popper’s point of view, indicates universal con-
viction, so prevalent among science theoreticians, regarding 
irremovable relationships between scientific theories and 
empirical reality. Although position of truth as a value which 
characterizes findings of science has become weaker with 
development of instrumentalist tendencies, strong relation-
ships with experience, as assumed by all theoreticians, seem 
to be a strong counterargument  against the tendencies, dis-
seminated especially among culturalists, towards the science 
to be apprehended above all in social and constructive cate-
gories and towards the ties of science with empirical reality to 
be depreciated.  
The studies which have been carried out as well as compi-
lation of the acknowledged values allow to state that the 
category of truth and some version of realism are integral, 
though not always acknowledged,  elements of scientific 
knowledge. It is also worthwhile to stress that almost all the 
authors distinguish anti-values in their concepts of science. 
Whereas certain sentences are wrong, defective, inadequate, 
it means that particular models of scientific knowledge are 
based on assumption concerning the ability of apt recognition 
of reality, which still more establishes above formulated regu-
larity. 
The tendency can be noticed in most science concepts to 
apprehend its cognitive status within conventional-objective 
categories with a strong accent on primariness of language-
related components being expression of theory articulation. It 
is sure to be the specificity of 20th century philosophy which 
bears “responsibility” for mitigation of objectivistic tendencies 
in the field of science comprehension.

Another tendency is acceptance of the question of non-
eliminability of knowledge etiology and background knowl-
edge by more contemporary science theoreticians. As this 
tendency is connected with the growth of pragmatic expec-
tations formulated towards scientific knowledge, it is im-
possible to unambiguously determine if knowledge „in-
strumentalization” is cause of appreciation of role of 
knowledge etiology or its result. 
Intersubjective communication is possible in respect of 
axiological decisions made by particular authors, at least in 
scope where they mention the features accepted in content 
of scientific theories. However, wherever the authors formu-
late the normative suppositions, it is necessary to carry out 
detailed research which goes beyond the scope of this paper. 
Valuing-normative elements appear in all concepts under 
discussion and they principally cannot be removed from 
them. What is more, each concept assumes a certain epis-
temological-axiological pattern of both scientist and theo-
ries followed by him, which are supposed to be (or are) 
scientific theories. Differences in intensity of presence of 
axiological factors can also be observed in particular sci-
ence concepts which is related to of the way of distribution 
of accents on above mentioned elements of scientists’ ac-
tivities and on the science as an institution. 
The paper I have prepared provides some reasons for 
consideration of the hypothesis, according to which re-
valuations which have taken place in science and in sci-
ence theory during last decades are related to deep 
changes in culture which result in giving up thinking in 
categories of opposition, dichotomy and clear criteria. 
Process of growth of role of pragmatic factors in field of 
scientific research and growing social pressure motivated 
by tendency of knowledge instrumentalization is especially 
visible by consequent differentiation of basic research from 
the applied one. Although, in case of basic research which 
are mostly apprehended in realistic way any values are 
derived in respect of main value (the truth), value system 
in the case of applied research is oriented above all to-
wards usefulness which causes axiology of applied re-
search to undergo relativization to a larger extent, which is 
result of characteristics of usefulness as a value. Taking 
these circumstances into consideration the need should be 
stressed to analyze relationship appearing between basic 
research and applied one on one hand, and their conse-
quent distinction in theoretical reflection on science, on the 
other hand. This need is especially clear in modern scien-
tific theory apprehensions, where a greater pressure of 
social factors can be observed which is expressed by more 
intensive instrumenatlization process of scientific knowl-
edge and, in consequence, by disappearance of science 
autonomy as a social institution. 
From the point of view of assumed main epistemological 
values, I have distinguished three basic types of science 
theory which determine main goal of scientific activity and 
appreciated features of knowledge in different ways, i.e. 
theories oriented towards realization of the following values: 
(i) cognitive values, (ii) instrumental values and (iii) cognitive-
instrumental values. According to first type of theory, central 
goal of scientific activity is to recognize world, so it is impor-
tant to strive for gaining true knowledge or the knowledge 
which allows to understand world through explanatory theo-
ries, or to describe phenomena and regularities occurring in 
world. The goal of the second type of of theory is to provide 
knowledge being method and tool for realization of a number 
of extra-cognitive aims, like in case of life related needs and 
values connected therewith. The third concept of science 
stresses importance of both cognitive and extra-cognitive 
goals. Heuristic values are also connected with cognitive 
ones. They appear in a wider historical process because it 
is necessary to examine importance of a given knowledge 
(i.e. rank, cognitive importance), in order to determine 
them. Heuristic values may be related to knowledge with a 
differentiated information content; however, they are above 
all referred to theoretical knowledge being expressed 
therein in form of such a value as feracity (fertility). The 
basis of heuristic values is the acknowledgment of impor-
tance of new knowledge. Although it is assumed that new 
knowledge should comply with particular logical and meth-
odological requirements, it is difficult to define such a value 
as novelty. 
Despite the fact that a number of sciences are dominated 
by cognitive values, there also exist disciplines of applied 
research  where main values are of extra-cognitive nature 
(medicine, technological sciences). In case of those disci-
plines main goal is to create new knowledge but most impor-
tant is not the knowledge reflecting and explaining reality but 
knowledge of instrumental values connected with methods 
and projects of shaping determined systems of reality basing 
on known regularities and accepted systems of extra-
cognitive values. Presently, especially outside field of sci-
ence, truth ceases to be autonomous value: more and more 
frequently the knowledge becomes appreciated for its us-
ability which is a gradable and relative value in respect of 
recipient and situation. Besides, some conflicts may take 
place between cognitive values and instrumental ones. Al-
though orientation towards both cognitive and extra-
cognitive values seems equally necessary, acknowledgment 
by scientists of both cognitive and instrumental values does 
not mitigate conflict between those types of values. 
As mentioned by one of the authors: 
great achievements of modern science seem to indicate 
that the more we know about world and about our-
selves and about how we know, more difficult it is still to 
believe that our knowledge does not depend on species 
features, brain performance, language we use, culture 
we succeed, or social situation we live in. Whereas we 
do not believe in Cartesian God who protects us from 
demon’s malicious tricks or in transcendental reduction 
revealing grounds of any possible cognition, in episte-
mologically unquestioned pure empirical basis of scien-
tific knowledge or in autonomous mechanism of devel-
opment of world of pure ideas, then we cannot avoid 
conclusion that knowledge etiology has the epistemo-
logical meaning. [Amsterdamski 1994]. 
It can be stated that realistic interpretations of scientific 
theories support their being assessed as ones which dis-
cover laws of the nature, while antirealistic points of view 
support new theory to be assessed better than previous 
one but equally interim whereas it is impossible to keep 
position which is moderately antirealistic: so there remains 
to be either a consequent  instrumentalist or a realist. De-
cision regarding above dilemma depends on accepted 
model of science.  
The irremovable feature of philosophical disputes is their 
final indeterminableness. Realism, like everything else 
which lies outside boundaries of logics, is unprovable; it 
also cannot be denied because no event or any other ex-
perience can be acknowledged to be conclusive rebutment 
of realism; it is the same in case of antirealism. Even if we 
omit all arguments in favour of realism taken from science, 
there still remain semantic arguments. The realist is right 
when saying that in any discussion on realism  all argu-
ments raised against this point of view must be formulated 
in a language. The language is implicitly descriptive, it

 282
says about something, about a certain state of things, a 
real or fictitious one. If a state of things is fictitious then its 
description is false but negation must be a true description 
of reality in Tarski’s meaning. 
Analyzing presence of different values in philosophical re-
flection on science I justify the thesis that science, like other 
spheres of human activities, is full of values. The cognitive 
activity assumes acceptance for a determined set of values 
imposing a specific structure of goals and methods and pro-
viding the assessment criteria for  knowledge to be created. 
Each attempt of specifying values contained in science de-
pends on accepted philosophical theory of scientific cogni-
tion. Methodology dealing with reasons and with the choice 
of reasons must take values into account. If values did not 
play any significant role in cognition process, question could 
be asked why we care for true and consistent sentences and 
why we aim at remaining sentences to be rejected or, at 
least, not accepted. The above questions seem to be naive 
but, implicitly, they belong to the most difficult ones. We are 
not able to answer them if we do not have any theory of 
value at our disposal. Shall this ignorance be treated seri-
ously, the issue could be considered, e.g. which sentences 
are more important, the true ones or those beginning with 
the letter „j”. The introduction of criteria is always based on 
values and valuations. Contrary to postulates aimed at sci-
ence to be free of assessments  as raised by logical em-
pirists, tendency can be observed in some publications in 
field of science philosophy to restore important position of 
values  in process of science development and formation.  
Assessing expressions can be found in nearly all scientific 
dissertations. Even in logical papers there appear assess-
ments from time to time in the form of some incidental notes 
which, however, give information on principal position of  
researcher. In order to avoid introducing valuations into sci-
ence corps, the methodology of a given science should be 
led out of that science. Thus, for example proofs should not 
be regarded in categories of logics as they are carried out in 
framework of metatheory. In the case of proofs we refer to 
rules which are formulated in a meta language. There is no 
problem to introduce such a narrow term of “science”, a term 
excluding any assessments. Most surely then:  
The assessing expressions constitute an uneliminable 
component of science, whereas they cannot be re-
moved even from formal logics. All philosophers who 
were searching for the criterion of demarcation, 
searched implicitly for values which would distinguish 
science from among other forms of cultural activity.

Phenomenological Actualism.  
A Husserlian Metaphysics of Modality? 
Michael Wallner 
Graz, Austria | michaelwallner1@gmail.com 
Abstract 
Considering the importance of possible-world semantics for modal logic and for current debates in the philosophy of modality, a 
phenomenologist may want to ask whether it makes sense to speak of “possible worlds” in phenomenology. The answer will 
depend on how “possible worlds” are to be interpreted. As that latter question is the subject of the debate about possibilism and 
actualism in contemporary modal metaphysics, my aim in this paper is to get a better grip on the former question by exploring a 
Husserlian stance towards this debate. I will argue that the phenomenologist’s way to deal with the problem of intentional refer-
ence to mere possibilia is analogous to the actualist’s idea of how “possible worlds” are to be interpreted. Nevertheless, I will be 
pointing to a decisive difference in the metaphilosophical preconditions of what I call “phenomenological actualism” and analyti-
cal versions of actualism. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
In their seminal work Husserl and Intentionality (1982) 
Smith and McIntyre argue that Husserl’s theory of inten-
tionality is best interpreted as a possible-world analysis of 
meaning. John Drummond (1990) raised serious objec-
tions to this interpretation, arguing that it does not make 
sense to speak of “possible worlds” in a phenomenological 
framework. In this paper I will not revisit this debate in de-
tail. I take Drummond’s interpretation to be the right one. 
However, I will argue that what needs to be rejected, from 
a Husserlian viewpoint, is just a specific interpretation of 
“possible worlds” – possibilism. I intend to show that 
Husserl’s account of the horizonal structure of intentionality 
can not only be reconciled with an actualistic interpretation 
of “possible worlds” but that in a sense Husserl himself 
qualifies as a sort of actualist. If I am right about this, the 
Husserlian ability to accommodate possible-world seman-
tics would stand and fall with the actualist’s ability to do so. 
I take it that carving out this Husserlian “phenomenological 
actualism” is progress for the phenomenological debate 
about modality and meaning. But it is questionable if it 
would also be progress for the debate in modal metaphys-
ics, as it can be doubted whether “phenomenological actu-
alism” can be seen as a contribution to the metaphysics of 
modality. That will depend on what concept of “metaphys-
ics” one has. 
2. Possibilism and Actualism 
The standard way of stating truth-conditions of modal sen-
tences appeals to possible worlds in the following way:  
 
(1) The statement ‘It is possible that p’ is true iff ‘p’ is 
true in some possible worlds.  
(2) The statement ‘It is necessary that p’ is true iff ‘p’ is 
true in all possible worlds.  
There has been considerable debate over how possible 
worlds and possible objects are to be understood onto-
logically. Possible worlds are – at least on a popular ac-
count – possible states of affairs that involve objects that 
do not actually exist but that might have existed. So, the 
underlying question seems to be whether there really are 
mere possibilia, i.e. merely possible things that do not ac-
tually exist. So-called possibilists answer this question in 
the affirmative.  
(P) In addition to actually existing things there are 
merely possible things that do not actually exist.  
Roughly speaking, we are dealing with a Meinongian posi-
tion here. The denial of the possibilitst’s thesis is called 
actualism:  
(A) Everything there is exists actually.  
Whether or not the actualist can make use of the possible-
world semantics will depend on the question whether pos-
sible worlds can be understood actualistically, i.e. without 
any appeal to non-actual objects whatsoever.  
Distinguishing actualists from possibilists by their respec-
tive answers to the question whether there are mere pos-
sibilia does not do justice to all possibilistic positions on 
the market. David Lewis’s modal realism is typically tagged 
possibilistic but gives a negative answer to that very ques-
tion – just as the actualist does. Lewis famously holds that 
possible worlds are concrete existents. This means that 
(merely) possible worlds as well as the merely possible 
objects in these worlds exist just like our actual world and 
objects. Now, if we consider mere possibilia as non-
existent objects that could have existed, for Lewis there 
clearly are no such things, as he claims that everything – 
the actual and the possible – exists in the very same way. 
But Lewis is considered a possibilist. In a sense even more 
so than the Meinongian, considering that his ontological 
commitment to possible worlds and possible objects 
seems to be even stronger. To make sense of Lewis’s be-
ing a possibilist we need to carve up the distinction be-
tween possibilism and actualism in a different manner. 
Lewisian possibilism is the thesis that  
(P*) possible worlds are ontologically on a par with the 
actual world.  
To make sense of this one has to take into account 
Lewis’s indexical understanding of the term “actual”. 
Whether something is actual, is relative to a specific world. 
Relative to our world, talking donkeys are not actual but 
they surely are relative to the concretely existing talking-
donkey-world, i.e. to the “world-mates” of the talking don-
keys. (Cf. Lewis 1986, 92f.)  
If we understand possibilism along these lines, actualism 
is the denial of (P*). Actualists maintain the special onto-
logical status of the actual world by not taking the term “ac-
tual” to be indexical.

(A*) Possible worlds are ontologically not on a par with 
the actual world. 
In what follows I will argue that Husserl’s transcendental 
phenomenology qualifies as a sort of actualism, in the 
sense that it is in accord with (A*). But, as we shall see, 
Husserl’s accordance with (A*) will need further qualifica-
tion. 
3. Phenomenological Actualism  
For the purpose of understanding the Husserlian stance 
towards the debate about possibilism and actualism we 
need to sketch the phenomenologist’s way of analyzing 
intentional relations to “merely possible” things that (ap-
parently) don’t exist. What happens phenomenologically 
when we intend Pegasus? Does that involve the existence 
of mere possibilia? Do phenomenologists suppose Pega-
sus to exist in a possible world?  
Before answering these questions, we may want to get 
clear about the phenomenological description of intention-
alities involving objects we assume to exist. Let’s take my 
perception of this table in front of me. Now, although I’m 
intentionally directed towards the table as a whole, I’m only 
actually presented with its front side. The back side and all 
the other aspects of the table which I am not currently pre-
sented with are nonetheless “co-given” as a horizon of 
possible presentations of the table. (Cf. Husserl 1983, 94.)  
Looking at the table from this angle, the colour of the 
back is not intuitively given, but it is horizonally anticipated. 
What does that mean? It is predelineated by the co-given 
horizon that the back side will have some colour. But what 
specific colour that is is left open. In that sense we can 
speak of the co-given horizon as the “correlate of the com-
ponents of undeterminateness essentially attached to ex-
periences of physical things themselves” (Husserl 1983, 
107). These components of undeterminateness leave 
open possibilities of fulfilment. This is ultimately why Smith 
and McIntyre speak of the horizon as a set of possible 
states of affairs and ultimately as a set of possible worlds. 
(Cf. Smith and McIntyre 1982, 303.) 
This interpretation of Husserl’s notion of “horizon” as a 
set of possible worlds has been criticised by John Drum-
mond. (Cf. Drummond 1990.) On Drummond’s interpreta-
tion of Husserl’s notion of “horizon” and of his account of 
intentional relations to seemingly non-existent objects, it 
does not make sense to speak of a plurality of worlds in 
Husserl’s framework. I take Drummond’s view to be the 
right one (systematically and exegetically). I will argue, 
however, that his interpretation is reconcilable with an ac-
tualistic interpretation of “possible worlds”. 
Let’s consider an example of an apparently object-less 
intention. Think of Pegasus or of any winged horse. I think 
we can agree upon the fact that neither Pegasus nor any 
other winged horse actually exists. Nevertheless, we can 
be intentionally directed toward Pegasus. Now, does that 
mean that we are referring to a merely possible thing? Or 
to a winged horse that exists (concretely) in a merely pos-
sible world? On Drummond’s account we are imaginatively 
presented with Pegasus and thereby directed toward an 
imagined object.  
Thus, although the imaginative presentation of Pegasus 
is object-less in the sense that there is no actual physi-
cal existent which is Pegasus, it is not object-less in the 
sense that Pegasus does exist in an imagined world, 
and this imagined world both takes at least some of its 
components from the real, physical world and has its 
sense as an imagined world only as a modification of 
and departure from the real world. The sense of the 
imagined world is possible, in other words, only in the 
contrast to the real world […]. (Drummond 1990, 212) 
So, that means that this “imagined world” we consider 
Pegasus to be a part of is in a sense founded in the actual 
world. In other words, every imagination has to take its 
departure from the actual world, inasmuch as it can only 
consist in the variation and recombination of actually given 
objects and their aspects. Drummond’s point is that the 
imaginative presentation of Pegasus, therefore, has hori-
zonal reference to perceptual presentations of actual ob-
jects and thereby to actualities existent in the actual world 
(Cf. Drummond 1990, 211.) So in these cases of appar-
ently object-less reference there is reference, not simply to 
mere possibilia, but “to actual objects or aspects thereof 
upon whose experience the present, apparently object-
less reference to fictional […] objects depends” (Drum-
mond 1990, 212).  
That these “imagined worlds” and the “imaginative pres-
entations of (fictional) objects” are dependent upon the 
actual world means that they are anything but separated 
from the actual world. This leads Drummond to the conclu-
sion that Husserl’s notion of horizons should not be under-
stood in terms of “possible worlds” but rather as referring 
to “possible presentations of objects and to possible ob-
jects in the actual world” (Drummond 1990, 216; my em-
phasis).  
This is especially plausible if we consider Husserl’s ac-
count of the (actual) world as the universal horizon. Ac-
cording to Husserl, the object of our intentional directed-
ness is given within a horizonal field not only of other pos-
sible presentations of the given object but also of other 
objects that are unthematically apprehended. This field 
and every horizonal field must be taken “as a sector ‘of’ the 
world, of the universe of things for possible perceptions” 
(Husserl 1970, 162). This notion of the (actual) world as 
the universal horizon is the correlate of all possible inten-
tional references. Let’s turn to our example to make this 
intelligible: Although the actual world does not contain 
winged horses qua physical things, it contains all the mate-
rial on which imaginative variation that leads to the imagi-
native presentation of winged horses depends. Roughly 
stated, one can say that although there are no winged 
horses in the actual world, they are possible precisely be-
cause their sense is horizonally “included” in the actual 
world taken as universal horizon. If the actual world as this 
universal horizon is the universe of all possible intentional 
reference, there is neither room nor use for different dis-
tinct possible worlds that are on a par with this actual 
world. 
I agree that we must not interpret Husserl’s notion of ho-
rizons and the horizonally predelineated possibilities as 
“possible worlds”, if these are understood in the Lewisian 
way as concretely existing entities, on a par with our world 
but causally and spatiotemporally separated from it. But 
the very idea of actualism, as opposed to Lewis’s modal 
realism, is to not take the term “possible world” at face 
value. In Stalnaker’s actualistic framework, for instance, 
“possible worlds” are equated with properties the actual 
world might have. (Cf. Stalnaker 2012, 8.) My claim is that 
Husserl’s account of the horizonal structure of intentionality 
and of apparently object-less intentional reference is – in 
an important sense – analogous to actualistic interpreta-
tions of possible-world semantics like Stalnaker’s. The 
horizonally predeliniated possibilities or Drummond’s 
“imagined worlds” are only aspects or sectors of the actual 
world (taken as universal horizon). That means they are

not on a par with the actual world, which is – as we re-
member – the main idea of (anti-Lewisian) actualism.
1 
What I hope to have shown is that Husserl’s account of 
the horizonal structure of intentionality draws on the same 
idea as the actualist’s position in the debate about modal 
metaphysics. We now need to turn to one significant dif-
ference between what I’d like to call “phenomenological 
actualism” and other forms of actualism. 
Contrary to the current debate about actualism in ana-
lytic philosophy, phenomenology does not presuppose re-
alism about the actual world. (Cf. Uemura 2013, 142.) 
Husserl’s transcendental method ties his phenomenology 
to pure description of the correlation of subject and world, 
i.e. the ways objects are given to us. This is the core idea 
of Husserl’s “transcendental idealism”. A realistic position 
that ascribes being to the actual world and the objects 
therein completely independent from this correlation can-
not be accommodated in phenomenology. Now, what does 
that mean? 
Phenomenological actualism also maintains (A*) that 
“possible worlds” (which are taken as horizonally prede-
lineated possibilities in phenomenology) are not ontologi-
cally on a par with the actual world (taken as the universal 
horizon of all possible intentional reference). But Husserl’s 
method of phenomenological description and his “tran-
scendental idealism” make it clear that this special “onto-
logical” status that is attributed to the actual world cannot 
refer to anything beyond the correlation of subject and 
world. It can – in other words – not point to anything be-
yond the mode of givenness of the actual world. If we want 
to understand the terms “ontological” or “metaphysical” as 
referring to a realm beyond that very correlation, phe-
nomenological actualism cannot be said to determine a 
special “ontological” status of the actual world. We should 
in that case rather stick to the thesis (A*’) that “possible 
worlds” (horizonally predelineated possibilities) are not 
phenomenologically on a par with the actual world (univer-
sal horizon) and thereby distinguish phenomenological 
actualism from ontological actualism. If “metaphysics” and 
“ontology” are understood that way, phenomenological 
actualism cannot be seen as a position in modal meta-
physics, but rather in modal epistemology. 
                                                      
1 Genki Uemura (2013) comes to a similar conclusion about Husserl and 
actualism, at least as far as the late Husserl is concerned. 
4. Conclusion 
This peculiar difference between what I’ve called phe-
nomenological and ontological actualism has to do with 
methodological and ultimately metaphilosophical differ-
ences between Husserlian and some branches of analyti-
cal philosophy. Phenomenologists do not wish to contrib-
ute to the inventory of items we need to put in our onto-
logical shadowbox but to describe what happens if we are 
intentionally directed towards different things. As this de-
scription is taking place strictly within the correlation of 
subject and world, no reference whatsoever is made to 
any shadowbox beyond this very correlation. Whether we 
take that as a cost or a benefit will depend on the beliefs 
we have about what philosophy can and should do. Never-
theless there surely is a phenomenological inventory of the 
items, which are all included within the universal horizon, 
i.e. the actual world. We have seen that this phenomenol-
ogical inventory suffices for a description of apparently ob-
ject-less intentionalities.

Four types of Knowledge in Wittgenstein 
Paul Weingartner  
Salzburg, Austria | paul.weingartner@sbg.ac.at  
Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to show that there are at least four important types of knowledge in Wittgenstein’s Works on Cer-
tainty and Remarks on the Foundation of Mathematics. These four types of knowledge are discussed also in the tradition not 
necessarily on one place and not systematically. They also occur on several places in these two works of Wittgenstein and also 
not systematically. These four types can be characterised as follows: 
(1) Knowledge 1 as true understanding 
(2) Knowledge 2 as ability to prove it 
(3) Knowledge 3 as justified true belief 
(4) Knowledge 4 as possessing justified information 
 
 
1. Knowledge 1 as True Understanding 
As Aristotle says in his Posterior Analytics “all teaching 
and all intellectual learning come about from already exist-
ing knowledge” (71a1). And such knowledge consists of 
principles “which are true and primitive and immediate and 
more familiar than and prior to and explanatory of the con-
clusion” (71b21). A subclass of these which are necessary 
to grasp for anyone who is going to learn anything he calls 
axioms. 
Examples from the tradition would be the principles of 
non-contradiction, simple logical laws like p  p, simple 
mathematical truths like that of the multiplication table etc. 
Wittgenstein characterises axioms with similar properties 
but stresses in addition the difference to empirical proposi-
tions. 
“The axioms of a mathematical axiom-system ought to 
be self-evident.” 
“Why are the Newtonian laws not axioms of mathemat-
ics? Because we could quite well imagine things being 
otherwise.” 
“Something is an axiom, not because we accept it as 
extremely probable, nay certain, but because we assign 
it a particular function, and one that conflicts with that of 
an empirical proposition. 
We give an axiom a different kind of acknowledgment 
from an empirical proposition. And by this I do not mean 
that the ‘mental act of acknowledgment’ is a different 
one.”
1 
“But if someone were to say ‘so logic too is an empirical 
science’ he would be wrong.”
2 
Descartes and Leibniz included also empirical truth under 
the self-evident axioms like the Cogito ergo sum. But it 
seems that Wittgenstein did not do that since there are not 
such examples discussed by him. 
                                                      
1 Wittgenstein, Remarks III, §1, 4 and 5. 
2 Wittgenstein, On Certainty, 98. 
2. Knowledge 2 as Ability to Prove 
This type of knowledge is discussed in many places in 
Wittgenstein, especially in the Remarks part II.  
“A mathematical proof must be perspicuous. Only a 
structure whose reproduction is an easy task is called a 
‘proof’. It must be possible to decide with certainty 
whether we really have the same proof twice over, or 
not.” 
“A proof ought to show not merely that this is how it is, 
but this is how it has to be.”
3 
“What is unshakably certain about what is proved? To 
accept a proposition as unshakably certain – I want to 
say – means to use it as a grammatical rule: this re-
moves uncertainty from it.”
4 
Wittgenstein seems to understand “proof” mainly in the 
sense of mathematical or logical proof and not in the 
sense of an empirical verification; however concerning the 
aspect of certainty a mathematical or logical proposition 
might not be too different from some type of empirical 
propositions:  
“I want to say: If one doesn’t marvel at the fact that the 
propositions of arithmetic (e.g. the multiplication tables) 
are ‘absolutely certain’, then why should one be aston-
ished that the proposition ‘This is my hand’ is so 
equally?”
5 
Commentary to the quotations concerning proof.  
If we look at famous and difficult mathematical or logical 
proofs it is very questionable whether they are perspicu-
ous; and their reproduction is certainly not an easy task. 
Take as examples the proofs of Matjasiewich (1970, 10
th 
Problem of Hilbert) of Wiles (1994, Fermat’s Conjecture) 
and of Perelman (2004, Poincaré conjecture). Even the 
last claim, that it is decidable whether we have the same 
proof twice, is not guaranteed viz. can be very complicated 
to decide (provided that the same does not mean syntacti-
cally the same signs).  
The second quotation stresses two aspects of the proof 
correctly: First the difference between factual truths on the 
one hand and between logical and mathematical truths on 
the other, pointing out that a proof is not just a factual 
                                                      
3 Remarks II, § 1 and 9. 
4 Remarks II, § 39. 
5 On Certainty, 448.

truth. Second that the rules or principles for a proof have a 
necessary and/or normative character; they say that it has 
to be that way.  
Under the grammatical rule (third quotation) Wittgenstein 
means the valid logical rules (principles) of proof. He 
seems to point out the analogy between a language and a 
deductive system where the first has grammatical rules 
and the second deduction rules. 
The last quotation concerns certainty. And here his posi-
tion is that there are some empirical propositions which 
have equal certainty as some logical propositions. 
3. Knowledge 3 as Justified True Belief 
This characterisation of knowledge is already proposed in 
Plato’s dialogue Theaitetos. It is a characterisation that is 
very widely applicable. In very many cases in which we 
say that we know we in fact have justified true belief, that 
is we believe experts. This is also very much the case with 
scientific knowledge: scientists have justified true belief in 
the results of their colleagues.  
“I might suppose that Napoleon never existed and is a 
fable, but not that the earth did not exist 150 years ago. 
Do you know that the earth existed then? Of course I 
know that. I have it from someone who certainly knows 
all about it.”
6 
“The schoolboy believes his teachers and his school-
books.”
7 
“In the court of law the mere assurance ‘I know...’ on 
the part of a witness would convince no one. It must be 
shown that he was in a position to know.”
8 
The point in the last quotation that the witness has to show 
that he was in a position to know is very important. Only 
then others and especially the judge can have justified true 
belief in what he says. 
Against knowledge 3 (justified belief) some counterex-
amples have been put forward; in the sense that there are 
cases of justified true belief which are not cases of knowl-
edge. The most well-known are the two cases of Gettier
9. 
However, they are of such artificial nature that neither 
Wittgenstein nor any scientist would have even dreamed 
to construct such situations. On the other hand there are 
several serious counterexamples known from the history of 
science: every well-justified true mathematical conjecture 
is justified true belief but not knowledge as long as there is 
no proof (although there might be results which serve as 
parts of the final proof). Fermat’s conjecture and Poin-
caré’s conjecture are good examples. Similarly there are 
well-justified true conjectures about results of important 
experiments but not knowledge before the result is estab-
lished. Einstein’s predictions of his Theory of General 
Relativity are good examples. What does this say? It does 
not say that the characterisation of knowledge as justified 
true belief is useless – on the contrary – it can be very 
widely applied. It says only that it cannot be used as a uni-
versal definition because there are some interesting ex-
ceptions.

4. Knowledge 4 as Possessing Justified In-
formation 
The term “information” has many different meanings. Mah-
ner and Bunge
10 mention six: information as signal, as the 
message signalled, as the meaning of this message, as 
negentropy, as knowledge, as communication of informa-
tion (in the fifth sense, with the help of information in the 
second sense).  We take out the fourth and fifth meaning.  
Take the following example of the following two proposi-
tions A and B: 
A: Pat Suppes will arrive in Salzburg within March 3 
and March 9, 2014. 
B: Pat Suppes will arrive in Salzburg on March 3, 2014. 
We ask now: What is the number of possible real states 
which satisfy A and the number of possible real states 
which satisfy B? Where possible real states are under-
stood in the following way: if they occur, they last a short 
time interval such that a measurement or observation is 
possible. This number we call the epistemic entropy of A, 
B; symbolically EE(A), EE(B). It is evident that EE(A)  
EE(B).   
Take as a second example the three laws of Kepler for 
planetary motion: 
L1  All planets move in ellipses, the sun in one focus. 
L2  In equal times the radius-vector passes over equal 
surfaces. 
L3  T²/a³ = constant 
 
(where T is the time of one revolution around the 
sun and a is the greater half axis of the ellipse). 
We can easily understand that EE(L1, L2)  EE(L1, L2, 
L3). And further, if we add some boundary conditions, say 
the numerical value of the masses of the planets (m) and 
its distances from the sun (d), then it holds: 
EE(L1, L2, L3)  EE(L1, L2, L3, m, d). 
A somewhat analoguous concept was proposed by van 
Fraassen: the valuation space of a proposition p is the set 
of possible situations in which p is true.11 This concept 
however differs in two respects from the epistemic entropy. 
First it concerns the set, not the number. Second it con-
cerns possible situations which seem to be more general 
but also more inaccurate than possible real states. The 
above set may have infinitely many members. But since 
possible real states occupy some small time interval if they 
occur, there are only finitely many occurring real states in a 
universe with finite age. It has to be observed further that 
possible real states are understood in such a way that they 
do not satisfy the usual closure conditions of First Order 
Predicate Calculus, but are restricted by relevance condi-
tions. Thus disjunctions of possible real states are not pos-
sible real states.
12  
Imagine now we concentrate on another number related 
to the epistemic entropy: the number of possible real 
states which are forbidden or excluded by the proposition 
in question. We call this number the epistemic information 
of the proposition in question and abbreviate it symboli-
cally as EI. 
                                                      
10 Mahner and Bunge (2000), 275. 
11 Van Fraassen (1971). 
12 The respective relevance criterion has been proposed in Schurz and 
Weingartner (1987), (2010) and is approximately represented by a 6-valued 
decidable propositional logic in Weingartner (2009).

 288
Applying this concept to the above examples it is easily 
understood that EI(A)  EI(B) and also that EI(B)  EE(B). 
Concerning Kepler’s laws the epistemic information of all 
the three laws is greater than that of one or two laws and 
the epistemic information of the three laws + boundary 
conditions on m and d is greater than that of the three 
laws: 
EI(L1, L2, L3)  EI(L1, L2) 
EI(L1, L2, L3, m, d)  EI(L1, L2, L3) 
There are places in Wittgenstein where he seems to de-
scribe an idea similar to our epistemic information. He 
speaks of propositions which rule out all counterexamples: 
“Don’t I seem to know that I can’t be wrong about such 
a thing as my own name? ...but what influence has it on 
the application of language?” 
“Is it through the impossibility of anything’s convincing 
me of the contrary?” 
“’My knowledge of my name is absolutely definite.’ I 
would refuse to entertain any argument that tried to 
show the opposite.”
13 
We might define the fourth type of knowledge thus: 
Knowledge 4, i.e. possessing justified information about 
p means to grasp both the epistemic entropy of p and 
the epistemic information of p.

Wittgenstein, the Aim of Philosophy and Negativism 
Sebastian Wyss 
Zurich, Switzerland | sebastian.wyss@uzh.ch  
Abstract 
What, according to Wittgenstein, is the aim of philosophy?  Many of the formulations that Wittgenstein employs to describe it 
have a negative ring, e.g.: The results of philosophy are nonsense, the philosopher a fly in the fly-bottle. This seems to support 
the ascription of negativism to Wittgenstein, the view that the aims of philosophy are purely negative.  
I distinguish two versions of negativism: For the first, Schroeder’s, the aim of philosophy is to dismantle philosophical doctrines. 
The second goes less far, but maintains that the aim is nothing else than to remove misunderstandings. In contrast, I argue that 
the second formulation of negativism is not negative at all: Resolving Misunderstandings cannot be understood as a pure re-
moval, but the troubled person’s understanding has to be deepened in the process of eliminating misunderstandings. 
 
 
1. Doctrinal Negativism 
[The Philosophical Investigation’s] thrust is entirely 
negative, aimed at nothing more and nothing less than 
a demonstration that [any] philosophical doctrine is in-
variably the result of linguistic confusion (Schroeder 
2006, p. 151, my emphasis).  
Schroeder claims that for Wittgenstein, the aim of philoso-
phy is nothing else than to dismantle philosophical doc-
trines. With that, he heaves doctrines into an important 
role: If there are no doctrines, there are no tasks left for a 
philosopher. There is one passage in the PI that fits 
Schroeder’s interpretation of the philosophical aims to 
some extent:  
Woher nimmt die Betrachtung ihre Wichtigkeit, da sie 
doch nur alles Interessante, d. h. alles Große und Wich-
tige, zu zerstören scheint?  (Gleichsam alle Bauwerke; 
indem sie nur Steinbrocken und Schutt übrig läßt.) Aber 
es sind nur Luftgebäude, die wir zerstören, und wir le-
gen den Grund der Sprache frei, auf dem sie standen. 
(PI, §118)  
Here, it indeed seems to be the case that for Wittgenstein 
the task of the philosopher is not a constructive one, but 
merely destructive. On this reading, all we do in philosophy 
is to tear down houses of cards of philosophers, that is, 
show them that their philosophical doctrines rest without 
exception on a misunderstanding of words. But Schroe-
der’s reading is already wrong for this passage: Wittgen-
stein writes that it seems as if this were all we do. More-
over, while one effect of Wittgenstein’s philosophy is to 
dismantle philosophical doctrines without really replacing 
them with new ones, this is, so to speak, only a peripheral 
effect. Much more important is to remove misunderstand-
ings of our own forms of language. Thus, we must distin-
guish between the negative aim and its corollaries: If there 
is something negative about Wittgenstein’s aim, it is not 
primarily directed at philosophical doctrines, but at misun-
derstandings. This can be seen by considering again the 
last sentence from the quoted passage (this time in Eng-
lish): “But what we are destroying are only houses of 
cards, and we are clearing up the ground of language on 
which they stood.” (PI, §118, my emphasis) The important 
part of the seemingly negative aim of philosophy is not the 
destruction of houses of cards, turning the apparent sensi-
cality of particular philosophical doctrines into patent non-
sensicality, but “clearing up the ground of language on 
which they stood,” getting rid of the misunderstandings 
that got us into the business of house construction in the 
first place.  
2. Comprehensive Negativism 
There is another form of negativism which is closer to my 
interpretation of the aim as clear understanding: The aim 
of philosophy is nothing else than to get rid of misunder-
standings. Such a view may be propelled by these passa-
ges:  
Die Ergebnisse der Philosophie sind die Entdeckung ir-
gend eines schlichten Unsinns… (PI, §119)  
Der Philosoph behandelt eine Frage; wie eine Krank-
heit. (PI, §255)  
Was ist dein Ziel in der Philosophie? – Der Fliege den 
Ausweg aus dem Fliegenglas zeigen. (PI, §309)  
The first passage certainly has a negative ring – discover-
ing nonsense is the first step towards removing it. Accord-
ingly, removing nonsense would be the aim. How to re-
move nonsense? Of course, there is no free-floating non-
sense – what people say may turn out to be nonsense, 
what they say embodies a misunderstanding. In that way, 
the removal of nonsense turns out to be a removal of mis-
understandings.  
In the second passage, a philosophical question is com-
pared to an illness. A medical therapy attempts to cure the 
patient of the illness, which in effect gets rid of it. Similarly, 
in some cases, the question that is asked will not really be 
answered. A good example is “can the whole use of the 
word come before my mind when I understand it in this 
way?” (PI, §139), where rather a presumption of the ques-
tion is undermined: that there is a characteristic inner 
process of understanding. So perhaps this passage in-
sinuates that we are to remove the questions. But, of 
course, the way in which we do this matters. Eliminating 
the person asking the question might do for some pur-
poses, but not for the purposes of philosophy. Rather, by 
removing the misunderstandings that the person has (in 
view of the sources of them), the questions can be ad-
dressed in a philosophical therapy.1 
The third passage seems to stress the negative aspect, 
too. The fly-bottle is a usually deadly trap for a fly where it 
constantly bangs its body against the invisible glass (cf. PI, 
§119) and finally drowns in the sugary syrup. So this is a 
bad place into which one is lured by the empty promise of 
sugar water, which turns out to be not potable (in a wide 
                                                      
1 Moreover, one should restrict the scope of this remark, since some ques-
tions may receive answers: anti-sceptical assertions for instance can be as-
serted (Sometimes others know very well that I am in pain (cf. PI, §246)) – 
though, of course, answering the question is no treatment of it, is not enough 
to engage with the sceptic’s argumentation.

sense). All promises of deep metaphysical truths turn out 
to be nonsense, but for various reasons we are still at-
tracted to that place. To show the fly the way out of the fly-
bottle is to save its life, is to show the waylead human be-
ing the way back to sense. This might be read in a way 
that the aim is simply to get the fly out of that bad place. 
But this overlooks an important disanalogy: Showing the 
fly the way out of the fly-bottle does not confer to the fly 
the ability to find its way out this fly-bottle, but just hushes 
it out of the exit. In contrast, solving a philosophical prob-
lem does confer an ability to the waylead human being, the 
ability of understanding the part of grammar that poses 
problems (different from the general ability to solve any 
philosophical problem). When the fly leaves the fly-bottle, it 
has learned nothing and will, if its path crosses again a 
whiff of sugar, be captured by the same bottle, whereas a 
human being who has been shown the way out will (nor-
mally) not fall again into the same trap: For she now un-
derstands the sources of her misunderstandings and 
knows her way around that part of grammar that was caus-
ing her trouble. In fact, this disanalogy is already contained 
in the word “zeigen”, which carries with it the idea that 
there can be communication between the fly and Wittgen-
stein.  
3. Why “removing misunderstandings” is 
not negative 
Despite the fact that there is some prima facie support for 
comprehensive negativism, I propose to recognise two 
sides of Wittgenstein's aim of philosophy, which are intrin-
sically connected. One perfectly correct description of the 
aim of achieving clarity is negative: to rid us of misunder-
standings. The other perfectly correct description is posi-
tive: to deepen our understanding. The intrinsic connection 
complicates my stance towards comprehensive negativ-
ism: On my understanding of the aim of removing misun-
derstandings, it is not independent of deepening the un-
derstanding. This implies that it is not a form of negativism. 
However, as an initial statement, one can try to conceive 
the aim of removing misunderstandings as a negative one, 
though I doubt that after spelling out the notion “removing 
misunderstandings”, this can be upheld. What remains is 
the problem-relativity of clarity (of PI, §133) – but this could 
be read with a positive spirit: The first step towards achiev-
ing clarity is to formulate a problem.  
While there is no passage that unequivocally supports 
the idea that clarity has a positive aspect, I still want to de-
fend that interpretation. My munition is twofold: The first is 
the disanalogy of the fly-bottle metaphor I brought to atten-
tion above, which enables us to see that there is a spark of 
the positive in the negative. The second point arises if we 
contemplate the role that understanding plays in the whole 
process of recognising a philosophical problem, treating it 
and getting rid of it. A misunderstanding (or rather the sort 
of misunderstanding we are interested in) consists in a 
mismatch between the use and the explanations one 
gives. Accordingly, recognising a philosophical problem is 
getting aware of such a mismatch and to treat it is to align 
use and explanations anew. Before a philosophical prob-
lem crops up, the person involved already has an under-
standing of the linguistic forms that are concerned. Once 
caught in the philosophical trap, the initial understanding 
gives way to a lack of understanding. Once the problem is 
resolved, the misunderstanding is dissolved, the lack of 
understanding abolished. But the understanding has not 
undergone a transformation where its status is reversed to 
the initial state; rather it has been deepened. The explana-
tions the person now can give are more refined, thought 
through and adequate. Treating philosophical problems 
not only gets rid of misunderstandings, but in that process 
necessarily deepens the understanding. The positive and 
the negative descriptions of the aim are intrinsically linked.  
Is my assessment of the positive side of the aim of phi-
losophy the same as the one that Baker and Hacker 
(2005, p. 284) offer?  
Positively, philosophy aims to attain an overview of a 
conceptual field, to arrange grammatical data so that 
the manifold relationships become perspicuous.  
This sentence can be understood in two ways: On the first 
interpretation, the positive aim of philosophy is to write 
down a number of grammatical propositions. On the sec-
ond interpretation, the positive aim is a change in the abili-
ties of the person beset by a problem. One point in favour 
of the first interpretation is that they write that it is “philoso-
phy” that should attain the overview. But philosophy has 
no abilities, persons have. What follows the comma, “aims 
to arrange grammatical data”, clearly is to be understood in 
the first way, too. Arranged “grammatical data”, whether it 
is grammatical propositions or reports of what we say, is 
nothing else than a few propositions written on a piece of 
paper. What precedes the comma, “aims to attain an over-
view of a conceptual field”, can be understood in both 
ways. In the first, attaining an overview is then attaining a 
representation that encompasses a few grammatical 
propositions. In the second, it is the troubled person’s abili-
ties that have changed such that this person has an over-
view over the part of grammar at issue. As Baker and 
Hacker explain:  
[T]o attain an overview, in philosophy, is to grasp the 
salient grammatical features of the problematic term 
and apprehend the relationships between its use and 
that of other expressions with which it might wrongly be 
conflated or [...] differentiated. Giving a synopsis of the 
use of an expression [...] is a positive achievement. 
One who has an overview knows his way around in the 
grammar 
of 
the 
problematic 
expression… 
(Baker/Hacker 2005, p. 284) 
In my view, Baker and Hacker’s description of the positive 
aim remains janus-faced. On the one hand, they speak of 
“having an overview” (my emphasis), of “grasping [...] 
grammatical features” and the related abilities of that per-
son. On the other hand, “giving a synopsis” is something 
that philosophy as an institution could achieve. For in-
stance, one might want to say that Hacker has achieved in 
Human Nature to give a synopsis of the concepts pertinent 
to a study of human beings, and that this ipso facto is a 
goal achieved for philosophy. If this is what Baker and 
Hacker understand by “attaining an overview”, their inter-
pretation of Wittgenstein’s positive (aspect of the) aim dif-
fers from mine. In my view, they mix up the means for 
achieving an end with the end itself. A book, or a piece of 
paper with a set of grammatical propositions relevant for a 
problem is a means, a means that can be used to dispel 
the confusions and misunderstandings of a person. This is 
the function that Wittgenstein ascribes to surveyable re-
presentations: “Die übersichtliche Darstellung vermittelt 
das Verständnis…” (PI, §122) The German word “vermit-
teln” contains already the word “Mittel”, means, and a sur-
veyable representation is a means to produce understand-
ing, which is the aim. Thus, given the correctness of 
Hacker’s investigations in Human Nature, we could say 
that Hacker has achieved to clear up his own understand-
ing of concepts central to the study of human beings. He 
has now the ability to explain the grammar of these con-
cepts in ways that he could not have prior to the investiga-

tion; for instance, he can now point to salient features of 
their grammar. And this goal is something that each of us 
has to achieve for him- or herself, even if we can use help 
in the form of philosophical studies brought down to pa-
per.
