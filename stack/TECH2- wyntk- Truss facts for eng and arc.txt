WHY USE WOOD TRUSSES?
Contractors and builders know that
a MiTek engineered roof or floor
truss ensures quality and efficiency.
MiTek Trusses Save Money
Because costs are known in advance,
there’s no guesswork. Your site 
erection time is greatly reduced and
dollar losses from job site material
shortages and pilferage are eliminat-
ed.  
MiTek Trusses Are Reliable
Every MiTek truss has been individu-
ally designed and that design is
checked and approved by licensed
engineers for structural adequacy.  
MITEK TRUSSES Are Versatile
MiTek trusses provide more design
flexibility, inside and out, than con-
ventional framing. Offering numerous
custom design options, our trusses
present an economical and struc-
turally superior method for rapid
erection.

FRAMING

HANDLING, INSTALLATION
AND BRACING*
TEMPORARY BRACING
Temporary or installation brac-
ing is the responsibility of the
installer. Temporary bracing
should remain in place as long
as necessary for the safe and
acceptable completion of the
roof or floor and may remain in
place after permanent bracing is
installed.
It is the responsibility of the installer to
select the most suitable method and
sequence of installation available to
him which is consistent with the
owner’s (architectural) plans and speci-
fications and such other information
which may be furnished to him prior 
to installation. Trusses may be installed
either by hand or by mechanical means.
The method generally depends upon
the span of the trusses, their installed
height above grade, and/or the acces-
sibility or availability of mechanical
installation equipment (such as a 
crane or forklift).  
The  installer should be knowledgeable
about the truss design drawings, truss
placement plans, and all notes and 
cautions thereon.

Metal Plate Connected Wood Trusses, HIB-91”, by permission of Truss Plate Institute, Inc.

STORAGE
Trusses should be stored in a stable
position to prevent toppling and/or
shifting.  
If trusses are stored horizontally, the
blocking should be eight to ten foot
centers to prevent lateral bending. If the
truss bundle is to be stored for more
than one week, the solid-blocking, 
generally provided by the receiving
party, should be at a sufficient height
to lessen moisture gain from the
ground.  
During long-term storage, trusses
should be protected from the elements
in a manner that provides for adequate
ventilation of the trusses. If tarpaulins 
or other water resistant materials are 
used, the ends should be left open for
ventilation. If trusses are made with
interior rated fire retardant lumber,
extreme care should be taken to limit
outside exposure.
FIELD
ASSEMBLY
In some cases, the size or shape
of wood trusses is such that
some field assembly is required.
The installer is responsible for
proper field assembly.  
Complete details can be found in
the Building Component Safety
Information Guide to Good
Practice for Handling, Installing,
Restraining and Bracing of Metal
Plate Connected Wood Trusses,
available through WTCA (Wood
Truss Council of America) and
TPI (Truss Plate Institute).

STABILIZER
®
Temporary & permanent lateral bracing
The Stabilizer® accurately spaces roof truss-
es on 24" and 16" centers with an accuracy
of 1/32". It provides lateral restraints and
remains as a permanent lateral restraint. 
The Stabilizer installs as fast as the crane
can set trusses and clips on to ride up with
the truss to the plate line.
Most importantly the Stabilizer saves time
and money. It can reduce installation time
by 45 percent and crane expense by 35 per-
cent. It completely eliminates the time spent 
cutting temporary bracing lumber and de-
nailing and disposing of temporary bracing. 
The Stabilizer spaces and braces in one 
step with just a hammer.
MULTI-BRACE
™
ELIMINATOR
®
All-purpose permanent brace
Factory-installed T-Bracing
The MiTek® Multi-Brace™is the all-purpose
brace that satisfies virtually all of your 
permanent truss bracing requirements, yet
installs more quickly without adding costs.
The ultra light Multi-Brace delivers simple
shipping, handling on the ground and in the
roof system – assuring you of a safe and
accurately braced roof system.
Its unique nesting feature allows for substan-
tial material savings since it does not require
the customary one truss or 24" overlap of
conventional lumber bracing. 
MiTek Multi-Brace, the all purpose brace.
Speed up roof framing and eliminate 
field- applied compression web bracing 
with MiTek’s Eliminator™. Eliminator is the 
factory-installed alternative to field-applied
T-bracing and is engineered by MiTek®
20/20® software.
You can get peace of mind and an engi-
neered component when the T-bracing is
installed by your component manufacturer 
in their plant. T-bracing, installed in the 
right places, can reduce your web bracing
problems before they occur.
The Eliminator is the engineered solution 
to T-bracing installation. It can reduce labor
costs and call backs while improving job
safety.

SUGGESTIONS
2x6 “Strongback” lateral 
supports should be located 
on edge approximately every 
10 feet along the floor truss.
They should be securely 
fastened to vertical webs.
Blocking behind the vertical
web is recommended while
nailing the strongback. The
strongbacks should either be
secured to adjacent partition
walls or alternate “X” bridging
should be used to terminate the
bracing member.

RECOMMENDATIONS
& LIMITATIONS
In addition to allowable lumber stress
limitations, floor truss designs are also
regulated by maximum permissible
deflection-to-span and depth-to-span
limitations, as shown in the chart below.
The suggested camber to be built into
the truss during fabrication is also
included. 
The truss deflection is calculated by
complex engineering methods which
have been verified by extensive full-
scale load tests. The floor span-to-depth
limitation is intended to prevent 
objectionable floor vibration. All of the
following recommended limitations
should be achieved to provide a quality
floor system and assure complete 
customer satisfaction.
FOR DEPTH, DEFLECTION AND CAMBER
* Provide a minimum slope of 1/4" per foot of span for proper drainage to prevent water ponding

CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES
for ROOFS
 Support trusses that are stored 
horizontally on blocking to 
prevent excessive lateral bending 
and lessen moisture gain
 Brace trusses that are stored 
vertically, to prevent toppling or 
tipping
 Unload trusses on rough terrain 
or uneven surfaces, which could 
cause damage to the trusses
 Break banding until installation 
begins and the trusses are in a 
stable, horizontal position
 Lift bundled trusses by the bands 
and do not use damaged trusses
 Walk on trusses that are lying 
flat – this is a dangerous practice
for FLOORS
 Color-code floor truss ends 
for correct non-symmetrical 
installations
 Locate trusses to allow for 
plumbing or duct riser clearances
 Assure that trusses are installed 
with a joint located over an 
interior bearing
 Use warning tags on floor trusses 
to provide proper installation 
orientation and to warn against 
cutting or modifying trusses
 Permit stacking of drywall or 
plywood sheathing during 
construction on floor truss 
balcony cantilevers or at truss 
mid-span without proper shoring
 Use floor trusses when exposed 
to weather, chemically corrosive 
environment or extremely high 
humidity
 Cut truss chords or webs or 
modify them in any way during 
construction

CONCENTRATED
LOAD INFORMATION
Floor truss cantilevers often support 
load-bearing walls carrying roof 
live loads and wall material dead 
loads. The chart at left provides 
a convenient means of determining 
an equivalent concentrated load 
for representative roof loads which 
incorporate a 15% load duration 
factor for the roof load only.

SOUND TRANSMISSION
RATINGS
Various floor-ceiling systems exhibit different abilities to reduce sound transfer from one
room to another. This sound transmission resistance is measured by two indices - the Sound
Transmission Class (STC) which rates airborne sounds to evaluate the comfortability of a
particular living space and the Impact Insulation Class (IIC) which rates the impact sound
transmission performance of an assembly. These ratings are used by regional building
codes to regulate permissible sound transfer.
For more detailed information reference the Metal Plate Connected Wood Truss Handbook,

Transmission.

Notes
• Above representative loads are 
typical loading requirements for 
many regions in the country. However,
the required applied loading for 
design purposes is the responsibility 
of the building designer, within the 
limitations of the prevailing local, state 
or regional building code specifications.
• Roof trusses to be checked for local 
wind loadings.
• Commercial floors may require 
additional load cases.

The chord max-spans shown below, presented for six representative floor
loadings, are intended for use in bidding, estimating, and preliminary
design applications. For proper interpretation of these max-spans, note:
•
The max-spans are valid for the following (or better) lumber: 
No. 1 KD Southern Yellow Pine. Shorter spans will be achieved 
using lesser grade 4x2 lumber, while longer spans are generally 
possible with higher grade lumber.
•
The max-spans represent truss overall lengths, assuming 3-1/2" bear
ing at each end. The spans are equally valid for top chord-bearing 
and bottom chord bearing support conditions.
•
The minimum truss span-to-live load deflection is 360 for floor 
application. For example, the maximum permissible live load 
deflection for a 20' span floor truss is (20 x 12)/360 = 0.67".
•
In addition to the consideration of lumber strength and deflection 
limitations, the maximum truss span-to-depth ratio is limited to 20 for 
floor loadings.
For example the maximum span of a floor application truss 15" deep is 
15" x 20' = 300" span = 25' - 0" span.
•
Floor loadings have included 1.00 Load Duration Increase and 1.15 
Repetitive Stress Increase.

GLOSSARY
OF TERMS
4x2 Member A 2x4 lumber section used as a
structural component oriented such that its 
3-1/2" (4" nominal) face is horizontal.
Apex/Peak The uppermost point of a truss.
Axial Force A push (compression) or pull 
(tension) acting along the length of a member.
Usually measured in pounds or kips (1,000 lbs.)
or metric equivalent.
Axial Stress The axial force acting at a point
along the length of a member divided by the
cross-sectional area of the member. Usually
measured in pounds per square inch.
Balcony Cantilever A floor truss cantilever 
serving only as a balcony with no additional
wall loading acting on the cantilever portion.
Beam Pocket A rectangular opening within a
truss to accept a header beam for positive load
transfer.
Bearing A structural support, usually a wall, that
occurs at the top or bottom chord or between
the end points of a roof or floor truss.
Bending Moment A measure of the bending
effect on a member due to forces acting 
perpendicular to the length of the member.
Bending Stress The force per square inch of
area acting at a point along the length of a
member, resulting from the bending moment
applied at that point. Usually measured in
pounds per square inch or metric equivalent.
Bottom Chord The continuous 4x2 member
forming the bottom of the truss.
Bottom Chord Bearing A floor truss support
condition in which the truss load is transferred
to the bearing or support through the bottom
chord “sitting” on the support.
Butt Cut Slight vertical cut at the outside edge of
truss bottom chord made to ensure uniform span
and tight joints - usually 1/4 inch.
Camber An upward curvature built into a truss
during fabrication to counteract downward
deflection of the loaded truss.
Cantilever The portion of a truss extending
beyond the exterior face of a support (exclud-
ing the overhang).
Chase The opening in some floor trusses or
structural components in which the mechanical
equipment (ducts, plumbing, etc.) runs, typical-
ly a rectangular opening at the centerline. 
(Also referred to as a Duct Opening.)
Check A lengthwise separation of wood fibers,
usually extending across the rings of annual
growth, caused chiefly by strains produced in
seasoning.
Chord Splice A connection of the 4x2 chord
member between joints, joined by pre-splice
connector plates into the 3-1/2" faces and 
occasionally side plates into the 1-1/2" edges.
Clear Span Horizontal distance between interior
edges of supports.
Combined Stress The combination of axial and
bending stresses acting on a member simulta-
neously, such as occurs in the top chord (com-
pression + bending) or bottom chord (tension +
bending) of a truss.
Combined Stress Index (CSI) The summation of
axial and bending stresses divided by their
respective allowable stresses for a specific truss
member. This ratio, or index, represents the
structural “efficiency” of the member. The CSI
shall not exceed 1.00.
Concentrated Load Loading applied at a specif-
ic point, such as a load-bearing wall running
perpendicular to a truss, or a roof-mounted A/C
unit hanging from a truss.
Connector Plate Pre-punched metal toothed
connectors located at the joints and splices of a
truss and designed to transfer the forces which
occur at those locations.
Continuous Lateral Restraint (Brace) A member
placed and connected at right angles to a chord
or web member of a truss to prevent out of
plane buckling.
Cripple Rafter Infill rafter installed to continue
the roof line - fixed to valley board in valley con-
struction.
Dead Load Any permanent load such as the
weight of roofing, flooring, sheathing, insulation
or ceiling material, as well as the weight of the
truss itself.
Design Loads The dead and live loads which a
truss is engineered to support.
Deflection The maximum vertical displacement
of a structural member due to applied loading.
(Live load deflection is the displacement due to
live load.)
Depth The overall distance from the top of the
top chord to the bottom of the bottom chord.
Dimensional Take-Up The adjustment necessary
to alter standard repetitive floor truss panel
lengths to achieve the desired overall truss
span. Take-up can be made at one end, both
ends, or in the center. 
Doubled Chords The use of two 4x2 members
along specified top or bottom chord panels to
achieve added strength.
Dropped Cantilever The use of overlapping 4x2
floor truss top chord members to frame a bal-
cony cantilever with a “step-down” of 1-1/2" or
3" to provide positive drainage or application of
concrete deck.
Duration of Load (DDL) Increase A percentage
increase in the stress permitted in a member,
based on the length of time that the load 
causing the stress acts on the member. The
shorter the duration of the load, the higher the
percent increase in allowable stress.
End Detail The end detail provides the support
condition and necessary web orientation and
panel length to create the desired truss span.
Engineer Sealed Drawing A truss design where
loading requirements, lumber species, sizes,
grades and connector plate requirements are
detailed and a certified engineer’s seal is
affixed.
Extended Top Chord Bearing A floor truss sup-
port condition in which the truss load is trans-

member extending to “sit” on the support. 
Fan Truss A floor truss with 30" top chord 
panels and 60" bottom chord panels and a fan
web configuration.
Forces Axial compression or tension in structur-
al components due to applied loads.
Girder A structural member carrying large loads
due to attachment of trusses framing into the
girder (commonly called tie-in trusses).
Girder Truss Usually a multiple-ply truss de-
signed to carry other trusses over an opening.
Header Beam A short beam typically support-
ing framing adjacent to a stair opening, running
perpendicular to the floor trusses.
Header Truss A truss with 4x2 chords typically
supporting roof, wall and/or upper floor loads,
spanning over door or window openings. 
(For example, a garage door header truss.)
Heel Point on a truss at which the top and 
bottom chords intersect.
Heel Cut See Butt Cut.
Heel Height Vertical overall measurements at
the end of a truss where the top and bottom
chords meet.
Interior Bearing Any intermediate support 
condition in addition to the two exterior 
supports. A truss joint must be located above
an interior bearing.

TYPICAL
FLOOR TRUSS
Jack Rafter Infill rafter installed to continue the
roof line - fixed from wall plate to hip board in
hip end construction.
Joint The intersection of two or more members.
(Also referred to as a Panel Point.)
Joint Splice A splice of a chord member at a
chord-and-web joint.
Kneewall A short partition stud wall to increase
a wall height, typically from the concrete wall
plate to the floor decking.
Level Return A lumber filler placed horizontally
from the end of an overhang to the outside wall
to form a soffit.
L/D Ratio The ratio of the truss span (L) to its
depth (D), both dimensions in inches.
Live Load Any temporary applied load to a floor
truss chord; typically roof live load is snow,
while floor live loads are furniture, human occu-
pancy, storage.
Load-Bearing Wall A wall specifically designed
to transfer a roof load and/or upper floor load
into the foundation.
Machine Stress Rated Lumber (MSR) Lumber
which has been individually tested by a machine
at the lumber mill to determine its structural
design properties. MSR Lumber is designated
by a flexural (bending) stress and Modulus of
Elasticity, e.g., 1650F-1.5E.
Moisture Content of Wood The amount of mois-
ture in wood expressed as a percentage of its
oven-dry weight.
Moments A structural measure of the effects of
bending on a member due to applied loading.
Overall Rise Vertical distance from bottommost
part of the bottom chord to uppermost point on
the top chord.
Overhang The extension of the top chord of a
truss beyond the heel measured horizontally.
PCT Abbreviation for Parallel Chord Truss.
PLF Pounds per lineal foot, acting along a struc-
tural member, usually equal to the uniform load
(PSF) times the truss spacing.
PSF Pounds per square foot of uniform load.
Panel Length The distance between the center-
lines of two consecutive joints along the top or
bottom chord.
Panel The chord segment defined by two adja-
cent joints.
Panel Point The point where a web or webs
intersect a chord.
Peak Point on truss where the sloped top
chords meet.
Pitch Inches of vertical rise for each 12 inches of
horizontal run.
Plate A horizontal wood framing member, typi-
cally the top and bottom 2x4 members of a stud
wall or the 2x6 sill plate bolted to a concrete
wall for floor structural attachment. This pro-
vides the truss bearing.
Plenum Typically, the use of the entire floor
truss cavity formed by the floor above and the
ceiling below as a supply or return air “duct”.
Plumb Cut Top chord end cut to provide for ver-
tical (plumb) installation to fascia (face trim
board).
Pre-Splice Plates Connector Plates pressed into
the top and bottom 3-1/2" faces of two 4x2
chord members prior to final floor truss assem-
bly to achieve a structural chord splice.
Purlins Lumber (secondary structural compo-
nents) spanning between trusses to support
roof covering (sheathing).
1/4 Point point on triangular, Fink or Howe truss
where the webs connect to the top chord.
1/3 Point Point on triangular, Fink truss where
the webs connect to the bottom chord.
Reaction The total load transferred from the
uniform load (PSF) applied to the truss deck,
then into the truss, and ultimately, to the truss
bearing or support.
Ridge Line formed by truss peaks.
Rim Joist An exterior transition member sup-
porting the decking edge and wall sheathing,
usually tying the ends of floor trusses together.
(Also referred to as a Ribbon or Band Board.)
Scab Additional timber connected to the face of
a truss member to effect a splice, extension or
general reinforcement.
Shop Drawing Provides detailed information for
cutting of individual truss members.
Slope See Pitch.
Spacing The centerline-to-centerline distance
between trusses.
Span The overall distance between adjacent
interior supports or to the outside of supports
when at the end of a truss. (See detail above.)
Splice Point (Top & Bottom chord splice). The
point at which two chord members are joined
together to form a single member. It may occur
at a panel point or between panel points.
Square Cut End of top chord cut perpendicular
to slope of the member.
Strongback A 2x6 lateral brace, used in a verti-
cal orientation, running perpendicular to the
trusses, and attached to the truss vertical web
members.
Support The structural element resisting the
truss, usually a wall or beam. (Also referred to as
a Bearing.)
Symmetrical Truss Truss with the same configu-
ration of members and design loading occurring
on each side of truss centerline.
Top Chord The 4x2 member forming the top of
the truss.
Top Chord Bearing A floor truss support condi-
tion in which the truss load is transferred to the
bearing or support through the top chord or a
4x4 block end detail. With a 4x4 block, this is
referred to as an intermediate height bearing.
Truss A pre-built component that functions as a
structural support member. A truss employs one
or more triangles in its construction.
Truss-clip Metal component designed to pro-
vide structural connection of trusses to wall
plates to resist wind uplift forces.
Visual Grade Lumber Lumber which has been
visually rated at the lumber mill for structural
properties through rules established by national
lumber species associations.
Warren Truss A general truss configuration with
repetitive web “W” orientation. For floor truss
applications, the top and bottom chord panels
are typically 30" length, usually with a 24" wide
rectangular chase or duct opening at the cen-
terline.
Web A vertical or inclined member connecting the
top and bottom chords of a truss.
