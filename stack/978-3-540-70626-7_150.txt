Projection
Werner Stulpe
Projection, an idempotent linear  operator deﬁned on a vector space with values
in that vector space. That is, a linear operator P acting in a real or complex vector
space V is called a projection if (i) DP = V, DP being the domain of P, and (ii)
P 2 = P. For a projection P, I −P is also a projection, I being the unit operator.
Deﬁning X = RP and Y = RI−P where RP and RI−P denote the ranges of P
and I −P, a projection P induces the decomposition of the vector space V into the
linear submanifolds X and Y according to the direct sum V = X ⊕Y. That is, every
vector ψ ∈V can be written as a sum ψ = φ + χ where φ ∈X, χ ∈Y, and φ, χ
are uniquely determined (in particular, the zero vector is the only vector contained
in both, X and Y). Conversely, given a decomposition of V into the direct sum of
any two complementary submanifolds X and Y, V = X ⊕Y, then a projection P is
deﬁned according to Pψ = φ where ψ = φ +χ, φ ∈X, χ ∈Y; P is the projection
onto X w.r.t. Y. A projection P in a Banach space V need not be continuous, i.e.,
need not be bounded ( operator); a projection onto X w.r.t. Y is continuous if and
only if X and Y are closed submanifolds of the Banach space V [1].
In the context of Hilbert spaces ( Hilbert space), the concept of a projection can
be sharpened to that of an orthogonal projection [1–5], the latter being a projection

that is self-adjoint ( operator,  self-adjoint operator). That is, a linear operator
P in a complex (or real) Hilbert space is an orthogonal projection if (i) DP = H,
(ii) P = P 2, and (iii) P = P ∗. An orthogonal projection is a positive ( operator)
bounded operator with norm ( operator) ∥P∥= 1 for P ̸= 0; X = RP and
Y = RI−P are subspaces of H (i.e., closed linear submanifolds), and Y is the
orthocomplement of X ( Hilbert space). Thus, an orthogonal projection induces
the orthogonal decomposition H = X ⊕X ⊥. Conversely, every subspace X of H
induces the orthogonal decomposition H = X ⊕X ⊥of the Hilbert space H and
in consequence the deﬁnition of an orthogonal projection P according to Pψ = φ
where ψ = φ + χ, φ ∈X, χ ∈X ⊥; P is the orthogonal projection onto X. Hence,
there is a one-one correspondence between the orthogonal projections in H and the
subspaces of H. In the sequel, ‘projection’ means ‘orthogonal projection’ in H.
Let P1 and P2 be projections projecting onto the subspaces X1 and X2, respec-
tively. The product P1P2 is zero if and only if X1 and X2 are orthogonal to each
other, i.e., X2 ⊆X ⊥
1 ; equivalently, the sum P1 +P2 is a projection, P1 +P2 projects
onto X1 ⊕X2. The product P1P2 is a projection if and only if P1 and P2 com-
mute, i.e., P1P2 = P2P1, P1P2 projects onto X1 ∩X2; P1P2 = P2P1 is equivalent
to the existence of three mutually orthogonal projections E1, E2, and F such that
P1 = E1 + F and P2 = E2 + F. The difference P1 −P2 is a projection if and
only if X1 ⊇X2, P1 −P2 projects onto X1 ⊖X2 = X1 ∩X ⊥
2 ; X1 ⊇X2 is
equivalent to P2 = P1P2. If P1, . . . , Pn are projections onto mutually orthogo-
nal subspaces, say, Xi, then the sum n
i=1 Pi is the projection onto the direct sum
'n
i=1 Xi. If P1, P2, . . . is an inﬁnite sequence of projections onto mutually orthogo-
nal subspaces Xi, then, by Pφ = ∞
i=1 Piφ where φ ∈H, a projection P is deﬁned
which projects onto '∞
i=1 Xi. In the latter case, the inﬁnite sum ∞
i=1 Pi does not
converge in the operator norm (unless in the trivial case that Pi = 0 for all i > N),
instead it converges strongly, i.e., (∞
i=1 Pi)φ = ∞
i=1 Piφ for all φ ∈H.
As a subset of the ordered real Banach space Bs(H) ( operator) of the bounded
 self-adjoint operators in H, the set P(H) of all projections inherits the partial or-
der of Bs(H). That is, P1 ⩽P2, P1, P2 ∈P(H), if and only if ⟨φ|P1φ⟩⩽⟨φ|P2φ⟩
for all φ ∈H. The statement P1 ⩽P2 is equivalent to X1 ⊆X2 where X1 = RP1
and X2 = RP2. The partially ordered set P(H) is a complete lattice with the zero
operator as its smallest element and the unit operator as its greatest element, and the
association of every element P ∈P(H) with P ⊥= I −P is an orthocomplementa-
tion of P(H). Thus, (P(H), ⩽, ⊥) is a complete orthocomplemented lattice which,
in addition, is orthomodular and atomic ( quantum logic); P(H) is isomorphic to
the orthocomplemented lattice of the subspaces of the Hilbert space H where the
set of the subspaces is ordered by the set-theoretic inclusion.
If P is a projection onto X and φ1, φ2, . . . a complete orthonormal system in
X ( Hilbert space,  orthonormal basis), then Pψ = 
i⟨φi|ψ⟩φi, ψ ∈H. If
X is one-dimensional and φ a unit vector in X, one writes P = |φ⟩⟨φ| ( Dirac
notation); so, if the dimension of X is greater than one, P = 
i |φi⟩⟨φi| where the
sum, if it is inﬁnite, converges strongly. In particular, one writes I = 
i |φi⟩⟨φi|
where φ1, φ2, . . . is a complete orthonormal system of H.

Projection Postulate
Sheldon Goldstein
In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is given by its  wave function, a
vector ψ in the  Hilbert space of the system. The behavior of the wave function is
governed by two dynamical laws [1, 2]: (1) When the system is closed, i.e., when
it does not interact with its environment, its wave function evolves according to
 Schr¨odinger’s equation
iℏ∂ψ/∂t = Hψ,
(1)
where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. (2) When a measurement is performed
on the system in state ψ, its wave function changes in a different way; it “collapses,”
ψ →Pψ/∥Pψ∥,
(2)
to its (normalized) projection onto the subspace of its Hilbert space associated with
the result of the measurement. Here P is the corresponding  projection operator,
and the denominator provides the normalization, with ∥· ∥the Hilbert space norm,
∥ψ∥2 = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, given by the inner product ⟨· | · ⟩with which the Hilbert space is
equipped. This transition occurs with probability ∥Pψ∥2, the probability of the cor-
responding result. This rule is called the projection postulate; the associated change
of quantum state (2) is usually referred to as the  wave function collapse or as the
reduction of the state vector.
Strictly speaking, the projection postulate governs, not any measurement, but
only the most basic sort of measurement, called an ideal measurement, one which
changes the wave function as little as possible consistent with obtaining the rel-
evant information. In the simplest case, of an ideal measurement of a quantum
observable A – a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space of the system – with
non-degenerate spectrum λα and corresponding  orthonormal basis of eigenvec-
tors |A = λα⟩≡|λα⟩,
A |λα⟩= λα |λα⟩,
