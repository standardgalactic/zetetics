Foreword
This edition is for practical and widespread use to fill a void in existing technical 
literature for this field of knowledge. It will be tested through use and improved 
as needed. It is to be expected that omissions will be discovered by readers and 
critics, and that some of the entries will engender criticism and comment. The 
Nomenclature Committee of ASSE International will welcome every criticism and 
suggestion for inclusions and deletions in future editions.
Almost every professional society has a nomenclature committee. Ours decided 
to venture where no one in plumbing had gone before us – that is, to this actual 
publication. It is a beginning.
Let special legal meanings be decided by constituted authorities and the courts. 
It is the purpose of this book to be “descriptive,” not prescriptive; to describe, 
define, and explain, and not to prescribe limitations or establish fixed and 
restrictive meanings; to record the words and combinations of words used in 
plumbing, and to give the definitions and meanings of these words and terms. 
Wherever possible, nontechnical language has been used, but specialized and 
technical terminology have been retained wherever necessary to help give the 
truest pertinent meanings. It is intended, thereby, that either the knowledgeable 
sanitarian or the student who seeks to learn, can rely on the information to be 
found in this book.
Plumbers’ work encompasses many fields of knowledge. Plumbing is affected by 
advancements in technology, new inventions, improvements of materials, and 
discoveries in seemingly unrelated fields. Similarly, the terminology of plumbing 
is derived from everyday human language, which is constantly changing. In 
this dynamic environment, the Nomenclature Committee of ASSE International 
collected the terms and words of plumbing for this Plumbing Dictionary.
This dictionary includes many words that are not common in daily speech. On 
the other hand, it has many words that are regularly used by everyone, but have 
become specialized and thus have, in the sense used, become plumbing terms 
– like “vent,” “fixtures,” and “water closet.” To prepare this book, we started to 
collect words and terms from plumbing trade publications, product catalogues, 
text books, plumbing code books, reference books, and dictionaries. We 
solicited lists from people in all phases of plumbing; from manufacturers, 
plumbers, plumbing inspectors, and educators ... and we are extremely  
grateful for the enthusiastic responses we received.

iii	
Trade names and brand names have been purposely omitted from this book. 
Several grammatical functions such as pronunciation symbols, inflectional forms, 
and etymologies have been omitted as they are in most technical dictionaries. 
When two or more words have similar meanings, or are used interchangeably, 
the definition given under the term is the most-used or preferred. Use of varied 
terms and meanings, due to geographical differences, has resulted, in several 
instances, in a polysemous entry (many meanings for the same word).
The main entry appears in bold type without capitalization. Filing is in strict 
alphabetical order by letter, without regard to spacing, hyphens, etc. – as 
shellac, orange, and shellac white; before shell, tank. A word having more than 
one syllable is usually divided into phonetic syllables, retaining correct spelling. 
This is shown in parenthesis. (pa-ren-the-sis).
Definitions are shown in sentence form. Wherever examples follow the definition 
sentence, the first word of the example sentence is capitalized. Cross-references 
are encouraged by use of “see” and “see also” in small letters, no punctuation; 
followed by the referred-to term.
Special acknowledgment and gratitude of all contributors to this edition is due 
to lexicographer Amy Jacobson for the dedication and diligence that provided 
the wealth of information that was gathered for the first edition. The Library of 
Congress in Washington, D.C., The Cleveland Public Library in Cleveland, Ohio, 
and The Library of The American University in Washington, D.C. were used 
at various stages in the preparation of this book. The committee resubmitted 
sections to the subject authorities for their comments and criticism, and thus were 
able to maintain cross-checks for accuracy and completeness. We were capably 
assisted in cross-referencing and in keeping format by our librarian, Amy Isaacs.
The pursuit of this project has given many great personal pleasures, not 
the least of which were the pleasures of friendships proved over and over 
again in the cooperation of all who participated in preparing this book. The 
patience shown and the encouragement given by ASSE officers and members 
is gratefully acknowledged. Since the work of all contributors was voluntary, 
it was performed in time not otherwise preempted in busy schedules. Perhaps 
this patience will be rewarded by the early establishment of a repository for a 
library of catalogues and a long list of tradenames, the beginnings of which  
has been collected by the Nomenclature Committee in the course of preparing 
this book.

About ASSE International
ASSE International is an ANSI accredited standards developer and product 
certification body comprised of individual and sustaining members who 
represent all disciplines of the plumbing and mechanical industries. Its mission 
is to continually improve the performance, reliability and safety of plumbing 
and mechanical systems. ASSE’s product performance standards, professional 
qualifications standards, professional certification and product listing programs 
are developed in the interest of public health and safety. ASSE’s motto, 
“Prevention Rather than Cure,” has guided the organization for over 100 years.
ASSE International maintains more than 50 product performance standards, 
ranging from double check and reduced pressure backflow preventers to 
dielectric pipe unions, with many more in the development stages. ASSE’s 
product standards are minimum performance requirements for component 
parts of the plumbing system. These standards detail how a product is intended 
to function under normal operating conditions, not how it is designed or 
manufactured. ASSE also has multiple professional qualifications standards, 
jointly developed with the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical 
Officials (IAPMO), including the ASSE/IAPMOANSI Series 5000,  
Cross-Connection Control Professional Qualifications Standard, and the  
ASSE/IAPMO/ANSI Series 6000, Professional Qualifications Standards 
 for Medical Gas Systems Personnel. 
ASSE standards are developed and revised under the ANSI accredited 
standards development process. 
The ASSE Product Listing Program is an ANSI accredited third party certification 
body which operates in accordance with ISO Guide 65. With more than 1,000 
product listings, this program is continually evolving and growing to meet the 
needs of the plumbing industry. ASSE’s directory of listings is available free of 
charge and updated online daily. This permits both members and nonmembers 
to reference ASSE’s Product Listing Directory during the design, installation or 
inspection process. The ASSE Seal gives inspectors, code officials, customers 
and users confidence of the product’s performance within the plumbing system

175	
In addition to certifying plumbing and mechanical products, ASSE International 
is also a third party certifier for professionals in the plumbing and mechanical 
industries. Cross-connection control professionals, medical gas personnel and 
installers/inspectors of residential potable water fire protection systems may 
be certified to one or more of the standards within the ASSE/IAPMO/ANSI 
professional qualification standards. Each individual must pass both a written 
and a practical examination on the criteria established in the course outline.
ASSE International’s membership is a cross-section of the plumbing and 
mechanical industries, including contractors, engineers, inspectors, journeymen, 
apprentices, manufacturers and many others. This unique composition gives 
members the opportunity to exchange ideas and provides a forum where 
all sides can express their views. No other industry group provides such a 
wide range of information. Benefits of ASSE membership include the monthly 
eNewsletter and Backflow Prevent & Plumbing Standards (BPPS) magazine, 
discounts on all publication orders, voting rights at Annual Meetings  
and networking opportunities in all segments of the plumbing and  
mechanical industries. 
Since 1906, the motto, “Prevention Rather Than Cure,” has guided ASSE’s 
activities in a wide range of programs designed to educate the industry and the 
public on the necessity of correct plumbing installations.

A gallon (U.S. Standard) of water contains 
231 cubic inches and weighs 8.345 
pounds (avoirdupois) at maximum 
density and at normal temperatures.
A gallon (British Imperial) of water 
contains 277.418 cubic inches and 
weights 10.022 pounds (avoirdupois) at 
maximum density.
To find British Imperial gallons, multiply 
the U.S. gallons by 0.833.
To find U.S. gallons, multiply the British 
Imperial gallons by 1.201.
A cubic foot of water contains 7.482 
gallons or approximately 71/2 gallons, 
1728 cubic inches, and weighs 62.428
