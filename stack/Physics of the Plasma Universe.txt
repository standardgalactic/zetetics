Preface
Physics of the Plasma Universe, Second Edition
Twenty years have passed since the printing of the ﬁrst book on this topic, Physics
of the Plasma Universe. As the ﬁrst printing was soon exhausted, there became a
need for a new printing or a new book. At this time, I had organized several IEEE
sanctioned International Workshops on Plasma Cosmology and was hesitant to sim-
ply reprint the ﬁrst book because of the growing amount of new data whose inclu-
sion would enhance a second book. But with the cessation of all nuclear testing
in July 1993, I was reassigned to the Department of Energy in Washington D.C.,
1995–1999, where I was tasked in representation of Los Alamos, Sandia, and Liver-
more National Laboratories, experiments and simulations. Nevertheless, in spite of
several exciting posts, International Conferences on Plasma Cosmology were held
world-wide. Two new books were published, Plasma Astrophysics and Cosmology,
Kluwer, 1995 and Advanced Topics on Astrophysical and Space Plasmas, Kluwer,
1997 as well as other research papers. In addition, Professors Alv Egeland and
William Burke had published their book on Kristian Birkeland, The First Space Sci-
entist, an edition ﬁlled with details as to how the study of space plasma came to be.
Over the decades we have been fortunate to have access to institutes possessing
the fastest computers at the time: The Magnetic Fusion Energy Computational Cen-
ter (MFECC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Lab-
oratory, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology,
Sandia National Laboratories, and support from the Mission Research Corporation,
NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and the U.S. Air Force
Ofﬁce of Scientiﬁc Research, Virginia, whose encouragement proved invaluable.
Countering the growth of faster computers, better diagnostics, and nuclear re-
search facilities has been the encroachment of those not schooled in plasma science,
computer science, physics, astrophysics, or high-power electrical, pulsed energy,
and nuclear engineering. Without exception they rail at barriers placed to insure
sound scientiﬁc technique and methodology. In times past, their ‘achievements’
were limited to hand-written, mimeographed, or in-house notes. Peer-reviewed

Preface
papers in print in archived journals or even short letters in their town OpEd page
were beyond their reach. However, now the internet or World Wide Web allows
anyone, even cults, to present their cacaphony to the world, often citing unsuspect-
ing researchers as ‘colleagues’ for false endorsement. As Hannes Alfven, Harold
Urey, and myself, during our tenure at the New Astrophysics lectures at the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego, 1979–1981, said, ‘they deserve no attention’. Indeed,
as if a topic of psuedoscience, the subject was never even raised.
As in the ﬁrst edition, this book could not have been written without the en-
couragement and support of colleagues and collaborators, who in addition to those
listed above include: Drs. Emil Wolf, D. F. W. James, E. Witalis, A. K. T. Assis,
M. C. C. Neves, W. G. Tifft, H. Arp, M. Marconi, T. Miller, Kevin Healy (VLA),

Mostrom, G. Verschuur, and to Wing Fay Yao whose extensive knowledge of Asian
cosmology and history proved invaluable and whose perserverance insured I would
ﬁnish the Second Edition.

I am indebted to Prof. Hannes Alfv´en, University of Southern California, whose
instruction started me on an unexpected path of the study of space and cosmic plas-
mas, for which we collaborated in Los Angeles, La Jolla, and Stockholm for the
next 23 years.
I am equally indebted to Prof. O. Buneman, STAR Laboratory, Stanford Univer-
sity. It was Oscar, ‘Father of the Particle Simulation of Plasmas’, from whom I was
taught this discipline on supercomputers during a 12-year collaboration. It is ﬁtting
that Oscar’s last plenary talk at the IEEE International Conference in Vancouver,
1993, was to have been “Simulation From Electron Devices to Cosmic Plasma.”
Physics of the Plasma Universe, First Edition
The purpose of this book is to address the growing recognition of the need for
plasma physics in astrophysics. In fact, astrophysics has contributed to the growth
of plasma physics, especially in the ﬁeld of plasma waves. During the last decade
plasma physics, or more appropriately, plasma science, has witnessed an explosive
growth in two areas: pulsed-power technology and space physics. Both have led to
knowledge that is mutual and complementary, and the material in this book largely
derives from these new discoveries and their application to astrophysics. With the
passage of the Voyager spacecraft in 1989, Neptune was transformed from an as-
tronomical object to a space science object. In our solar system only Pluto remains
unvisited. In this decade of exploration, the solar system has become recognized
as the primary plasma laboratory in which plasma processes of great generality
and astronomical signiﬁcance can be studied in situ. By the 1960s, with the dis-
covery of the earth’s natural plasmas, the Van Allen radiation belts, and the solar
wind, it was already clear that future understanding of the earth and sun would be
expressed in terms of plasmas. Today plasma is recognized as the key element to
understanding the generation of magnetic ﬁelds in planets, stars, and galaxies; phe-
nomena occurring in stellar atmospheres, in the interstellar and intergalactic media,

in radio galaxies and quasars, and in active galactic nuclei; and the acceleration and
transport of cosmic rays (F¨althammar 1988). There are convincing arguments for
the view that the clouds out of which galaxies form and stars condense are ionized:
The problem of the formation and structure of these clouds and bodies, therefore,
naturally belongs to the ﬁeld of cosmic plasmas as well as astrophysics. Each has
traditionally been pursued independently. Only recently has there been a tendency
to view them as a uniﬁed discipline. Together these problems form what is called
The Plasma Universe, the basis for the book. The material presented dwells basi-
cally on the known properties of matter in the plasma state. Some of the interesting
topics in contemporary astrophysics such as discordant redshifts and other cosmo-
logical issues are not discussed here. The interested reader will be referred to the
IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, Special Issues on Space and Cosmic Plas-
mas (December 1986, April 1989, and February 1990) and Laser and Particle Beams
(August 1988). This book is organized into eight chapters. Chapter 1 is an introduc-
tion to the fundamental physics of cosmic plasmas. An attempt is made to review
the known properties of plasmas from the laboratory scale to the Hubble distance.
Chapter 2 starts the application of basic plasma theory to astrophysical plasmas in
the study of magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned (Birkeland) currents and charged particle beams.
Chapter 3 covers magnetism in plasma and the Biot-Savart force law, while Chap. 4
concentrates on electric ﬁelds in space and cosmic plasmas. Chapters 5–7 survey
double layers, synchrotron radiation, and energy transport in plasmas, respectively.
Chapters 10 and 11 cover the particle-in-cell simulation of astrophysical plasmas.
Found throughout the book are examples that apply the material of the chapter or
section to speciﬁc problems. At the end of the book are appendixes highlighting
topics that are often not covered in plasma physics or in astrophysics texts, or else
are well documented to the point that a short condensation sufﬁces. Appendix A
covers transmission line concepts in space plasmas. Appendix B is a condensation
of the polarization properties of plasma waves. In Appendix C dusty and grain plas-
mas are discussed. A list of references is given for each chapter. These are divided
into parts: General references give a list of papers and books that cover the gen-
eral aspects and often give a more thorough treatment of the subjects covered, and
special or specialized references document the sources for speciﬁc topics. As far as
possible, the equations are written to conform to SI regulations, but since this book
deals with the plasma universe whose elements transcend many disciplines, from
laboratory controlled fusion experiments to cosmology, a multitude of non-SI units
are used. For example, it is customary in the laboratory to state densities in parti-
cles per cubic centimeter and magnetic induction in gauss, rather than in per cubic
meter and tesla, as used in space plasmas. Likewise, units of light-years and parsecs
are more meaningful to describe the dimensions of galaxies and clusters of galaxies
than are meters. To aid visualization, both SI and familiar units are often given in
the text. This book could not have been written without the help and encourage-
ment of many friends and colleagues. I am grateful to my collaborators at the Royal
Institute of Technology, Stockholm, whose work I have freely drawn upon: Drs.
Carl-Gunne F¨althammar, Pers Carlqvist, Michael Raadu, Lars Block, Nils Bren-
ning, Steffan Torv´en, Lennart Lindberg, and Martin Bohm. I am appreciative to my

Prologue
This is a book about high-energy-density plasma (HEDP). In particular, HEDP
applied to astrophysics and cosmology. The contents are a result of 37 years re-
search at Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories, all associated with ex-
periments and simulations in the Applied Physics Division, Physics Division, the
Associate Laboratory Directorate for Experiments and Simulations, and Defense
Programs, U.S. Department of Energy.
The work was carried out within laboratory facilities and at the Nevada Test Site
(NTS), usually a few kilometers downhole or within tunnels onsite at Rainer Mesa.
Only in this way could I have access to the energies outlined in Chap. 13, taught
me by my mentors, Profs. Hans Kuehl (USC), Hannes Alfv´en (Royal Institute of
Technology and USC), and Oscar Buneman (Stanford). To these names I add those
listed in the Preface without whose guidance, insights, and contributions this book
would not be possible.
To be sure, nothing expected was ever encountered; only the unexpected but
readily recognizable from a standpoint of HEDP in astrophysics and cosmology,
to which I might add earth sciences. These were done jointly at NTS with Russian
counterparts under the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) during the early 2000s.
The terms ‘Plasma Universe’ and ‘Plasma Cosmology’1 were ﬁrst used to de-
scribe the 1.4-megaton (MT) 400-km altitude Starﬁsh Event (Fig. 1.4) above John-
ston Island in the Paciﬁc, with ground and satellite diagnostics (Brown et al. 1963).
The ﬁrst ‘full-up’, heavily diagnosed HEDP tests were carried out underground at
NTS with yields coincidentally slightly less than the TTBT limit.
To the names above I must add Charles Snell, a prime mover in studying
the records of over 100 U.S. and British nuclear tests at NTS and the Moruroa
archipelago nuclear tests in French Polynesia. In addition to this information was
the knowledge picked up by designing and executing intense particle beam experi-
ments, both marx-bank and high-explosive driven.
1 We coined these names in the mid- and late 1980s. Plasma Cosmology does require an under-
standing of broad-band explosive electromagnetic radiation as outlined in Chap. 6, some nuclear
experience, and of course radio astronomy.

Prologue
On the simulation side, my work with Oscar and his student Jim Green began
on the Magnetic Fusion Energy Cray’s. I had just rejoined Alfv´en, who under the
invitation of Harold Urey, discoverer of deuterium, had moved to the University of
California, San Diego (UCSD), to organize the La Jolla New Astrophysics semi-
nars. At the time, the Cray-2 (Fig. 10.1, 1980) was the fastest machine available
and it was this machine that could model the simplest realistic plasma conﬁguration
that Oscar, Jim, and I could think of: Two adjacent ion-electron ﬁlaments. These
were set up on Oscar’s code TRISTAN (Chap.10). Oscar insisted that these simu-
lations be fully three-dimensional, relativistic, and fully electromagnetic (gravity is
included).2 Once the plasma parameters were set, sizes, and density, magnetic and
electric ﬁeld strengths and directions were chosen, nothing could be changed except
run time. The code was run from 1980 to 2012 on ever faster computers as the years
went by, and the ﬁndings are those given in this book. None of the results were ever
expected nor could they be changed.
My special thanks are due to Prof. Timothy Eastman, who was always able to
keep my research tied to the achievements reported at IEEE conferences on Plasma
Astrophysics and Cosmology and the American Physical Society Topical Group on
Plasma Astrophysics, and Prof. Gerrit Verschuur, whose work extended the experi-
mental/simulation results greatly.

tan learning code given in the First Edition.

Cosmic Plasma Fundamentals
1.1 Plasma
Plasma consists of electrically charged particles that respond collectively to
electromagnetic forces. The charged particles are usually clouds or beams of
electrons, ions, and neutrals or a mixture of electrons ions, and neutrals but also can
be charged grains or dust particles. Plasma is also created when a gas is brought
to a temperature that is comparable to or higher than that in the interior of stars.
At these temperatures, all light atoms are stripped of their electrons, and the gas
is reduced to its constituent parts: positively charged bare nuclei and negatively
charged free electrons. The name plasma is also properly applied to ionized gases
at lower temperatures where a considerable fraction of neutral atoms or molecules
are present. However, the subject matter in this book is concerned primarily, but not
exclusively, with energetic or highly ionized plasmas.
While all matter is subject to gravitational forces, the positively charged nuclei,
or ions, and the negatively charged electrons of plasmas react strongly to electro-
magnetic forces, as formulated by Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925),1 but now called
Maxwell’s Equations, after James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879),2
∂B
∂t = −∇× E
(1.1)
∂D
∂t = ∇× H−j
(1.2)
∇• D = ρ
(1.3)
∇• B = 0
(1.4)
1 Oliver Heaviside was the ﬁrst to reduce Maxwell’s 20 equations in 20 variables to the two
Eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) in vector ﬁeld notation. For some years Eqs. (1.1)–(1.4) were known as the
Hertz-Heaviside Equations, and later A. Einstein called them the Maxwell-Hertz Equations. Today,
only Maxwell’s name is mentioned (Nahin 1988).
2 These are “rewritten” in update form ideal for programming. This also emphasizes the causality
correctly: ∇×E is the cause of changes in B, ∇×H is the cause of changes in D.

(1.5)
The quantities D = εE and B = μH are the constitutive relations between the electric
ﬁeld E and the displacement D and the magnetic induction B and magnetic intensity
H, μ and ε are the permeability and permittivity of the medium, respectively, and ρ
and j are the charge and current densities, respectively.3 The mass and charge of the
particle obeying the force law (1.5) are m and q, respectively.
Because of their strong interaction with electromagnetism, plasmas display a
complexity in structure and motion that far exceeds that found in matter in the
gaseous, liquid, or solid states. For this reason, plasmas, especially their electro-
dynamic properties, are far from understood. Irving Langmuir; (1881–1957), the
electrical engineer and Nobel chemist, coined the term plasma in 1923, probably
borrowing the term from medical science to describe the collective motions that
gave an almost lifelike behavior to the ion and electron regions with which he ex-
perimented. Langmuir was also the ﬁrst to note the separation of plasma into cell-
like regions separated by charged particle sheathes. Today, this cellular structure is
observed wherever plasmas with different densities, temperatures, or magnetic ﬁeld
strengths come in contact.
Plasmas need not be neutral (i.e., balanced in number densities of electrons and
ions). Indeed, the study of pure electron plasmas and even positron plasmas, as well
as the electric ﬁelds that form when electrons and ions separate, are among the most
interesting topics in plasma research today. In addition to cellular morphology, plas-
mas often display a ﬁlamentary structure. This structure derives from the fact that
plasma, because of its free electrons, is a good conductor of electricity, far exceed-
ing the conducting properties of metals such as copper or gold. Wherever charged
particles ﬂow in a neutralizing medium, such as free electrons in a background of
ions, the charged particle ﬂow or current produces a ring of magnetic ﬁeld around
the current, pinching the current into ﬁlamentary strands of conducting currents.
Matter in the plasma state can range in temperature from hundreds of thousands
of electronvolts (1 eV = 11,605◦absolute) to just 100th of an electronvolt. In den-
sity, plasmas may be tenuous, with just a few electrons present in a million cubic
centimeters, or they may be dense, with more than 1020 electrons packed per cubic
centimeter (Fig. 1.1). Nearly all the matter in the universe exists in the plasma state,
occurring predominantly in this form in the Sun and stars and in interstellar space.
Auroras, lightning, and welding arcs are also plasmas. Plasmas exist in neon and
ﬂuorescent tubes, in the sea of electrons that moves freely within energy bands in
the crystalline structure of metallic solids, and in many other objects.
Plasmas are prodigious producers of electromagnetic radiation.

Fig. 1.1 The remarkable range of temperatures and densities of plasmas is illustrated by this chart.
In comparison, solids, liquids, and gases exist over a very small range of temperatures and pres-
sures. In “solid” metals, the electrons that carry an electric current exist as a plasma within the
more rigid crystal structure
1.2 The Physical Sizes and Characteristics of Plasmas
in the Universe
1.2.1 Plasmas on Earth
On the earth, plasmas are found with dimensions of microns to meters, that is, sizes
spanning six orders of magnitude. The magnetic ﬁelds associated with these plas-
mas range from about 0.5 G (the earth’s ambient ﬁeld) to megagauss ﬁeld strengths.
Plasma lifetimes on earth span 12–19 orders of magnitude: Laser produced plasmas
have properties measurable in picoseconds, pulsed power plasmas have nanosec-
ond to microsecond lifetimes (Fig. 1.2), and magnetically conﬁned fusion oriented
plasmas persist for appreciable fractions of a second. Quiescent plasma sources,
including ﬂuorescent light sources, continuously produce plasmas whose lifetimes
may be measured in hours, weeks, or years, depending on the cleanliness of the ion-
ization system or the integrity of the cathode and anode discharge surfaces (Jursa
1985).

Lightning is a natural plasma resulting from electrical discharges in the earth’s
lower troposphere (Fig. 1.3). Such ﬂashes are usually associated with cumulonimbus
clouds but also occur in snow and dust storms, active volcanos, nuclear explosions,
and ground fracturing. The maximum time duration of a lightning ﬂash is about
2 s in which peak currents as high as 200 kA can occur. The conversion from air
molecules to a singly ionized plasma occurs in a few microseconds, with hundreds
of megajoules of energy dissipated and plasma temperatures reaching 3 eV. The dis-
charge channel avalanches at about one-tenth the speed of light, and the high current
carrying core expands to a diameter of a few centimeters. The total length of the dis-
charge is typically 2–3 km, although cloud-to-cloud discharges can be appreciably
longer (Willett et al. 1990). Lightning has been observed on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Venus (Borucki 1989). The energy released in a single ﬂash on earth, Venus,
and Jupiter is typically 6 × 108 J, 2 × 1010 J, and 2.5 × 1012 J, respectively.
Nuclear driven atmospheric plasmas were a notable exception to the gener-
ally short-lived energetic plasmas on earth. For example, the 1.4 Mt (5.9 × 1015 J)
Starﬁsh detonation, 400 km above Johnston Island, on July 9, 1962, generated
plasma from which artiﬁcial Van Allen belts of electrons circulating the earth were
created (Ness 1963). These electrons, bound at about 1.2 earth-radii in a 0.175G
ﬁeld, produced synchrotron radiation whose decay constant exceeded 100 days
(Fig. 1.4).

1.2.2 Near-Earth Plasmas
The earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere constitute a cosmic plasma system that
is readily available for extensive and detailed in situ observation and even active
experimentation. Its usefulness as a source of understanding of cosmic plasmas is
enhanced by the fact that it contains a rich variety of plasma populations with den-
sities ranging from more than 106 cm−3 to less than 10−2 cm−3, and temperatures
from about 0.1 eV to more than 10 keV.
The earth’s magnetosphere is that region of space deﬁned by the interaction of the
solar wind with the earth’s dipole-like magnetic ﬁeld. It extends from approximately
100 km above the earth’s surface, where the proton neutral atom collision frequency
is equal to the proton gyrofrequency, to about ten earth radii (∼63,800km) in the
sunward direction and to several hundred earth radii in the anti-sunward direction.
It is shown schematically in Fig. 1.5.

excess of 10 MV. The bright line a the lower right is the Santa Fe-Los Alamos highway (Courtesy

magnetic ﬁeld lines. Picture taken from a Los Alamos KC-135 aircraft 3 min after the July 9,
1962, 1.4-Mt 400-km-altitude nuclear detonation above Johnston Island. The event produced a
degradation of radio communications over large areas of the Paciﬁc and an intense equatorial tube
of synchrotron emitting electrons having a decay constant of 100 days. The brightest background
object (mark) at the top, left-hand corner is the star Antares, while the right-hand-most object is
θ-Centauri. The burst point is two-thirds of the way up the lower plasma striation
First detected by radio waves and then by radar, the ionosphere is a layered
plasma region closest to the surface of the earth whose properties change contin-
uously during a full day (Fig. 1.6). First to be identiﬁed was a layer of molecular
ionization, called the E layer. This region extends over a height range of 90–140km
and may have a nominal density of 105 cm−3 during periods of low solar activity.
A D region underlies this with a nominal daytime density of 103 cm−3. Overlying
the E region is the F layer of ionization, the major layer of the ionosphere, starting
at about 140 km. In the height range 100–150km, strong electric currents are gener-
ated by a process analogous to that of a conventional electric generator, or dynamo.
The region, in consequence, is often termed the dynamo region and may have den-
sities of 106 cm−3. The F layer may extend 1,000 km in altitude where it eventually
merges with the plasmas of the magnetopause and solar wind.
The interaction of the supersonic solar wind with the intrinsic dipole magnetic
ﬁeld of the earth forms the magnetosphere whose boundary, called the magne-
topause, separates interplanetary and geophysical magnetic ﬁelds and plasma env-
ironments. Upstream of the magnetopause a collisionless bow shock is formed in
the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction process. At the bow shock the solar wind
becomes thermalized and subsonic and continues its ﬂow around the magnetosphere
as magnetosheath plasma, ultimately rejoining the undisturbed solar wind.

1 Cosmic Plasma Fundamentals
In the anti-solar direction, observations show that the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is
stretched out in an elongated geomagnetic tail to distances of several hundred earth
radii. The ﬁeld lines of the geomagnetic tail intersect the earth at high latitudes
(≈60◦–75◦) in both the northern and southern hemisphere (polar horns), near the
geomagnetic poles. Topologically, the geomagnetic tail roughly consists of oppo-
sitely directed ﬁeld lines separated by a “neutral” sheet of nearly zero magnetic
ﬁeld. Surrounding the neutral sheet is a plasma of “hot” particles having a temper-
ature of 1–10 keV, density of ≈0.01–1cm−3, and a bulk ﬂow velocity of a few tens
to a few hundreds of km s−1.
Deep within the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a population of cold
(≤1 eV) ionospheric ions and electrons corotating with the earth. Table 1.1 lists
some typical values of parameters in the earth’s magnetosphere.
1.2.3 Plasmas in the Solar System
The space environment around the various planetary satellites and rings in the solar
system is ﬁlled with plasma such as the solar wind, solar and galactic cosmic rays
(high energy charged particles), and particles trapped in the planetary magneto-
spheres. The ﬁrst in situ observations of plasma and energetic particle populations in
the magnetospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Titan were made by the
Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft from 1979 to 1989. Interplanetary spacecraft have iden-
tiﬁed magnetospheres around Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
(e.g., Fig. 1.7).
Comets also have “magnetospheres”as depicted in Fig. 1.8. The comet-to-sheath,
a region extending about 1.1 × 106 km (for Comet Halley), consists of decelerated
plasma of density and temperature Te ∼1.5 eV. The peak magnetic ﬁeld strength
found in Comet Halley was 700–800mG.
Excluding the Sun, the largest organized structures found in the solar system are
the plasma tori around Jupiter and Saturn. The Jupiter-Io plasma torus (Fig. 1.9)
is primarily ﬁlled with sulphur ions at a density of 3 × 103 cm−3 (Sect. 4.6.2) An
immense weakly ionized hydrogen plasma torus has been found to encircle Saturn,
with an outer diameter 25 times the radius of the planet and an inner diameter of
about 15 Saturn radii (Book 1987, Lang 1974).
1.2.4 Transition Regions in the Solar System
Examples of transition regions include the boundary layers found in planetary and
comet magnetospheres (Table 1.2). Transition regions between plasmas of differ-
ent densities, temperatures, magnetization, and chemical composition offer a rich
variety of plasma phenomena in the solar system (Eastman 1990).

1.2.5 Solar, Stellar, and Interstellar Plasmas
The nuclear core of the Sun is a plasma at about a temperature of 1.5 keV. Beyond
this, our knowledge about the Sun’s interior is highly uncertain. Processes which
govern the abundance of elements, nuclear reactions, and the generation mechanism
and strength of the interior magnetic ﬁelds, are incompletely known.
We do have information about the Sun’s surface atmospheres that are delineated
as follows: the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the inner corona. These plasma
layers are superposed on the Sun like onion skins. The photosphere (T ∼0.5 eV) is
only a very weakly ionized atmosphere, the degree of ionization being 10−4–10−5
in the quiet regions and perhaps 10−6–10−7 in the vicinity of sunspots. The chromo-
sphere (T ∼4 eV) extends 5,000 km above the photosphere and is a transition region
to the inner corona. The highly ionized inner corona extends some 105 km above
the photosphere. From a plasma physics point of view, the corona is perhaps the

12
1 Cosmic Plasma Fundamentals
most interesting region of the Sun. The corona is the sight of explosively unstable
magnetic-ﬁeld conﬁgurations, X ray emission (Fig. 1.10), and plasma temperatures
in the range 70–263eV (Table 1.3).4 The source of this heating is uncertain.5

Solar ﬂares resulting from coronal instabilities raise temperatures to 10–30 keV
and produce relativistic streams of electrons and protons. Particles accelerated out-
ward produce radio interference at the earth. Protons accelerated inward collide with
ions in the Sun’s atmosphere to produce nuclear reactions, whose gamma rays and
neutrons have been detected from spacecraft. Solar ﬂares consist of plasma at a
temperature of about 1–10 keV. Although ﬂares represent the most intense energy
4 One of the Sun’s outstanding problems is the temperature of the corona. The temperature rises
steadily in the chromosphere, then jumps abruptly in the corona to a level 300 times hotter than the
surface. That the Sun is a plasma and not just a hot gaseous object is illustrated by the fact that the
temperature increases away from its surface, rather than cooling as dictated by the thermodynamic
principle for matter in the nonplasma state.
5 For decades the preferred explanation has been that energy ﬂows from the Sun’s surface to the
corona in the form of sound waves generated by convective upswelling motions. However, space-
based ultraviolet observations proved that sound waves do not carry energy as high as the corona.
One mechanism that may produce coronal heating is electron beams produced in double layers
in coronal loops (Chap. 5). These are expected to accelerate electrons to energies comparable to
those in the corona. Generally, the term acceleration refers to the preferential gain of energy by a
population of electrons and ions, while heating is deﬁned as the bulk energization of the ambient
plasma. Paraphrasing Kirchoff that “heating is a special kind of acceleration,” one may argue, since
heating and acceleration are always present in ﬂares and in laboratory relativistic electron beams,
that electron beam instabilities (Sect. 1.7.3) may be the source of coronal heating.

dissipation of any form of solar activity, releasing energy in the form of gamma rays,
X rays, and microwaves, the active sun has many other plasma manifestations.
These include sunspots, photospheric faculae, chromospheric and transition reg-
ion plages, large coronal loops, and even larger scale coronal streamers and occa-
sional coronal mass ejections. In addition, prominences (referred to as ﬁlaments
when seen in Hα absorption on the disk) frequently form between opposite mag-
netic polarities in active regions of the sun. These phenomena are dynamic, on time
scales ranging from seconds to the complete solar magnetic cycle of 22 years.
The outer corona and solar wind form the heliosphere (Fig. 1.11). At one ast-
ronomical unit the solar wind has a plasma density 5 ≤n ≤60 cm−3 and a velocity
of 200 ≤vsw ≤800 km s−1. Its temperature can be as high as 50 eV, while B may
reach 200 mG. The outer heliosphere has a plasma density, a temperature, and a
magnetic ﬁeld strength ∼1 mG. The local interstellar medium is characterized by
10−2 ≤n ≤1 cm−3, a temperature of order 1 eV, and magnetic ﬁeld strength 1 ≤
B ≤20 μG. Table 1.4 lists some of the parameter values found in the solar system.
The rotating sun, coupled with its continual radial ejection of plasma, twists its
magnetic ﬁeld (that is referred to as the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld or IMF) into a
classical Archimedean spiral, as depicted in Fig. 1.12a, b. Measurements have con-
ﬁrmed that the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld is directed toward the sun in certain
regions of the solar system and away from the sun in other regions. These regions
are separated by a very sharp boundary layer that is interpreted as a current layer.

situation, the planets ﬁnd themselves sometimes in a region where the ﬁeld has
a strong northward component and sometimes where it has a strong southward
component (Priest 1985).

Stellar plasmas have not only the dimension of the star, 0.3 × 106–108 km, but
also the stellar magnetospheres, a remnant of the interstellar plasma that the star and
its satellites condensed out of. The surface temperatures vary from about 0.3–3eV.
Estimates of the magnetic ﬁelds range from a few gauss to tens of kilogauss or more
for magnetic variable stars.

directed toward or away from the sun and northward or southward (Courtesy of T. Potemra)

1.2.6 Galactic and Extragalactic Plasmas
Dark clouds within our Galaxy have dimensions of 108 km and microgauss strength
magnetic ﬁelds (Fig. 1.13).
The Galactic plasma has an extent equal to the dimensions of our Galaxy
itself; ∼35 kpc or 1021 m. The most salient feature of the Galactic plasma are
10−3 G poloidal-toroidal plasma ﬁlaments extending nearly 250 light years (60 pc,
1.8 × 1018 m) at the Galactic center (Fig. 1.14). The vast regions of nearly neutral
hydrogen (HI regions) found in the Galaxy and other galaxies are weakly ionized
plasmas. These regions extend across the entire width of the galaxy and are some-
times found between interacting galaxies. They are detected by the 21 cm radiation
they emit.
Galaxies may have bulk plasma densities of 10−1 cm−3; groups of galaxies,
3 × 10−2 cm−3; and rich clusters of galaxies, 3 × 10−3 cm−3.
By far the single largest plasmas detected in the Universe are those of double
radio galaxies. In size, these sources extend hundreds of kiloparsecs (1021–1022 m)
to a few megaparsecs (1022–1023 m). Double radio galaxies are thought to have
densities of 10−3 cm−3 and magnetic ﬁelds of the order of 10−4 G (Fig. 1.15).

1.3 Regions of Applicability of Plasma Physics
The degree of ionization in interplanetary space and in other cosmic plasmas may
vary over a wide range, from fully ionized to degrees of ionization of only a frac-
tion of a percent.6 Even weakly ionized plasma reacts strongly to electromagnetic
ﬁelds since the ratio of the electromagnetic force to the gravitational force is 39
orders of magnitude. For example, although the solar photospheric plasma has a
degree of ionization as low as 10−4, the major part of the condensable components
6 The degree of ionization is deﬁned as np/(n0 +np) where np is the plasma density and n0 is the
density of neutral particles.

is still largely ionized. The “neutral” hydrogen (HI) regions around galaxies are
also plasmas, although the degree of ionization is only 10−4. Most of our knowl-
edge about electromagnetic waves in plasmas derives from laboratory plasma exp-
eriments where the gases used have a low degree of ionization, 10−2–10−6.
Because electromagnetic ﬁelds play such an important role in the electrodynam-
ics of plasmas, and because the dynamics of plasmas are often the sources of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds, it is desirable to determine where within the universe a plasma
approach is necessary. We ﬁrst consider the magnetic ﬁeld. The criterion for neg-
lecting magnetic effects in the treatment of a problem in gas dynamics is that the
Lundquist parameter (Sect. 2.4.2) is much less than unity,

where lc is a characteristic length of the plasma and ρm is the mass density. As the
conductivity of known plasmas generally varies only over about four orders of mag-
nitude, from 102 to 106 S/m, the value of is largely dependent on the strength of B
in the plasma as delineated in Table 1.6.
The variation of B in plasmas can be 18 orders of magnitude, from microgauss
strengths in intergalactic space to perhaps teragauss levels in the magnetospheres of
neutron sources. On earth, magnetic ﬁeld strengths can be found from about 0.5 G
(0.5×10−4 T) to 107 G (103 T) in pulsed-power experiments; the outer planets have
magnetic ﬁelds reaching many gauss, while the magnetic ﬁelds of stars are 30–40 kG
(3–4 T). Large scale magnetic ﬁelds have also been discovered in distant cosmic

20

objects. The center of the Galaxy has milligauss magnetic ﬁeld strengths stretching
60 pc in length. Similar strengths are inferred from polarization measurements of
radiation recorded for double radio galaxies. No rotating object in the universe, that
is devoid of a magnetic ﬁeld, is known.
In cosmic problems involving planetary, interplanetary, interstellar, galactic, and
extragalactic phenomena, is usually of the order 1015–1020 (Fig. 1.16). In plane-
tary ionospheres falls below unity in the E layer. Neglecting lightning, planetary
atmospheres and hydrospheres are the only domains in the universe where a nonhy-
dromagnetic treatment of ﬂuid dynamic problems is justiﬁed.
1.4 Power Generation and Transmission
On earth, power is generated by nuclear and nonnuclear fuels, hydro and solar en-
ergy, and to a much lesser extent, by geothermal sources and magnetohydrodynamic
generators. Always, the location of the supply is not the location of major power us-
age or dissipation. Transmission lines are used to convey the power generated to the
load region. As an example, abundant hydroelectric resources in the Paciﬁc North-
west of the United States produce power (∼1,500MW) that is then transmitted to
Los Angeles, 1,330 km away, via 800 kV high-efﬁciency dc transmission lines. In
optical and infrared emission, only the load region, Los Angeles, is visible from
the light and heat it dissipates in power usage. The transmission line is invisible
(Fig. 1.17).
This situation is also true in space. With the coming of the space age and the
subsequent discovery of magnetospheric-ionospheric electrical circuits, Kirchoff’s
circuit laws (Appendix A) were suddenly catapulted to dimensions eight orders of
magnitude larger than that previously investigated in the laboratory and nearly four
orders of magnitude greater than that associated with the longest power distribution
systems on earth.
On earth, transmission lines consist of metallic conductors or waveguides in
which energy is made to ﬂow via the motion of free electrons (currents) in the metal
or in displacement currents in a time varying electric ﬁeld. Often strong currents
within the line allow the transmission of power many orders of magnitude stronger
than that possible with weak currents. This is because a current associated with the
ﬂow of electrons produces a self-magnetic ﬁeld that helps to conﬁne or pinch the
particle ﬂow. Magnetic-insulation is commonly used in pulsed-power technology to
transmit large amounts of power from the generator to the load without suffering
a breakdown due to leakage currents caused by high electric potentials (Di Capua
1983).
There is a tendency for charged particles to follow magnetic lines of force
and this forms the basis of transmission lines in space (Appendix A). In
the magnetosphere-ionosphere, a transmission line 7–8 earth radii in length
(Re = 6,350km) can convey tens of terawatts of power, that derives from the solar

wind-magnetosphere coupling,7 to the lower atmosphere. The transmission line
is the earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld lines along which electrons and ions are con-
strained to ﬂow. The driving potential is solar-wind induced plasma moving across
the magnetic ﬁeld lines at large radii. The result is an electrical circuit in which
electric currents cause the formation of auroras at high latitude in the upper atmo-
sphere on earth. This aurora mechanism is observed on Jupiter, Io, Saturn, Uranus,
and is thought to have been detected on Neptune and perhaps, Venus.
Only the aurora discharge is visible at optical wavelengths to an observer. The
source and transmission line are invisible (Fig. 1.18). Before the coming of space
probes, in situ measurement was impossible and exotic explanations were often
given of auroras. This is probably true of other non in situ cosmic plasmas today.
The existence of a megaampere ﬂux tube of current, connecting the Jovian satel-
lite Io to its mother planet (Fig. 1.9), was veriﬁed with the passage of the Voyager
spacecraft.
7 It is not known how the energy carried by the solar wind is transformed into the energy of the
aurora. It has been demonstrated that the southward-directed interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld is an
essential ingredient in causing auroral substorms so that energy transformation appears to occur
through interactions between the interplanetary and geomagnetic ﬁelds (Akasofu 1981).

1.5 Electrical Discharges in Cosmic Plasma
An electrical discharge is a sudden release of electric or magnetic stored energy. This
generally occurs when the electromagnetic stress exceeds some threshold for break-
down that is usually determined by small scale properties of the energy transmission
medium. As such, discharges are local phenomena and are usually accompanied by
violent processes such as rapid heating, ionization, the creation of pinched and ﬁla-
mentary conduction channels, particle acceleration, and the generation of prodigious
amounts of electromagnetic radiation.
As an example, multi-terawatt pulsed-power generators on earth rely on strong
electrical discharges to produce intense particle beams, X rays, and microwaves.
Megajoules of energy are electrically stored in capacitor banks, whose volume may
encompass 250 m3. This energy is then transferred to a discharge region, located
many meters from the source, via a transmission line. The discharge region, or
load, encompasses at most a few cubic centimeters of space, and is the site of high-
variability, intense, electromagnetic radiation (Fig. 1.2).
On earth, lightning is another example of the discharge mechanism at work
where electrostatic energy is stored in clouds whose volume may be of the order of
3,000 km3. This energy is released in a few cubic meters of the discharge channel.

1.5 Electrical Discharges in Cosmic Plasma
23
Fig. 1.18 Solar Dynamics Observatory photograph of Earth’s southern aurora (Credit: NASA)
The aurora is a discharge caused by the bombardment of atoms in the upper at-
mosphere by 1–20 keV electrons and 200 keV ions spiralling down the earth’s mag-
netic ﬁeld lines at high latitudes. Here, the electric ﬁeld accelerating the charged
particles derives from plasma moving across the earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld lines
many earth radii into the magnetosphere. The potential energy generated by the
plasma motion is fed to the upper atmosphere by multi-megaampere Birkeland cur-
rents (Chap. 2) that comprise a transmission line, 50,000km in length, as they ﬂow
into and out of the discharge regions at the polar horns (Fig. 1.5). The generator

region may encompass 1012–1013 km3 while the total discharge volume can be 109–
1010 km3. The stored or generated and radiated energies and powers versus linear
dimension (approximately, the cube root of the volume) of several cosmic plasma
discharge objects are shown in Fig. 1.19.

1.6 Particle Acceleration in Cosmic Plasma
25
1.6 Particle Acceleration in Cosmic Plasma
1.6.1 Acceleration of Electric Charges
The acceleration of a charged particle q in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is mathemati-
cally described by the Lorentz equation (1.5),
F = ma = q(e+ v× B)
(1.7)
The electric ﬁeld vector E can arise from a number of processes (Chaps. 4 and 5)
that include the motion of plasma with velocity v across magnetic ﬁelds lines B,
charge separation, and time varying magnetic ﬁelds via Eq. (1.1).
Acceleration of charged particles in laboratory plasmas is achieved by applying
a potential gradient between metallic conductors (cathodes and anodes); by pro-
ducing time varying magnetic ﬁelds such as in betatrons; by radio frequency (RF)
ﬁelds applied to accelerating cavities as in linear accelerators (LINACS); and by
beat frequency oscillators or wake-ﬁeld accelerators that use either the electric ﬁeld
of lasers or charged particle beams to accelerate particles.
The magnetospheric plasma is essentially collisionless. In such a plasma, electric
ﬁelds aligned along the magnetic ﬁeld direction (Chap. 3) freely accelerate particles.
Electrons and ions are accelerated in opposite directions, giving rise to a current
along the magnetic ﬁeld lines (Chap. 2).
1.6.2 Collective Ion Acceleration
The possibility of producing electric ﬁelds by the space-charge effect to accelerate
positive ions to high energies was ﬁrst discussed by Alfv´en and Wernholm (1952).
They were unsuccessful in their attempt to experimentally accelerate ions in the col-
lective ﬁeld of clouds of electrons, probably because of the low intensity of electron
beam devices available then. However, proof of principle came in 1961 when Plyutto
et al. (1965) reported the ﬁrst successful experiment in which ions were collectively
accelerated. By 1975, the collective acceleration of ions had become a wide-spread
area of research. Luce (1975) reported collectively accelerating both light and heavy
ions to multi-MeV energies, producing an intense burst of D-D neutrons and nuclear
reactions leading to the identiﬁcation of several radioisotopes. Luce used a plasma-
focus device in the pinched plasma (Sect. 1.7). Subsequently, Destler et al. (1979)
collectively accelerated carbon ions to energies in excess of 170 MeV using a 6 MeV
electron beam.
Individual ion energies up to several GeV using pulsed-power generators have
been suggested in particle-in-cell simulations of collective ion acceleration pro-
cesses (Faehl and Godfrey 1978; Shanahan and Faehl 1981; Katsouleas 1987).

26
1 Cosmic Plasma Fundamentals
Collective acceleration as a mechanism for creating high energy ions in astro-
physical plasmas were investigated by Bostick (1986).
Refer also to Chap. 10 in this book.
1.7 Plasma Pinches and Instabilities
1.7.1 The Bennett Pinch
In cosmic plasma the perhaps most important constriction mechanism is the electro-
magnetic attraction between parallel currents. A manifestation of this mechanism is
the pinch effect as ﬁrst studied by Bennett (1934). Phenomena of this general type
also exist on a cosmic scale and lead to a bunching of currents and magnetic ﬁelds
to ﬁlaments. This bunching is usually accompanied by the accumulation of matter,
and it may explain the observational fact that cosmic matter exhibits an abundance
of ﬁlamentary structures.
Consider a fully ionized cylindrical plasma column of radius r, in an axial electric
ﬁeld Ez, that produces an axial current density jz. Associated with jz is an azimuthal
magnetic ﬁeld Bφ. The current ﬂowing across its own magnetic ﬁeld exerts a j × B,
radially inward, pinch force. In the steady-state, the balance of forces is
∇p = ∇(pe + pi) = j × B
(1.8)
By employing Eq. (1.2), ∇×B = μ0 j, and the perfect gas law p = NkT, we arrive
at the Bennett relation
2Nk(Te + Ti) = μ0
4π I2
(1.9)
where N is the number of electrons per unit length along the beam, Te and Ti are
the electron and ion temperatures, I is the total beam current, and k is Boltzmann’s
constant.
1.7.2 The Force-Free Conﬁguration
Sheared magnetic ﬁelds are a characteristic of most plasmas. Here, the sheared ﬁeld
is considered a nonpotential ﬁeld that is caused by shear ﬂows of plasma. A nonpo-
tential ﬁeld tends to settle into a particular conﬁguration called a “force-free” ﬁeld,
namely
(∇× B)× B = 0
(1.10)
or
j × B = 0
(1.11)

1.7 Plasma Pinches and Instabilities
27
since j = ∇× Bμ−1
0 , showing that the electric current tends to ﬂow along B.
Substituting (1.11) into (1.8) gives F = ∇p = 0, hence the name “force-free”.
Force-free ﬁelds tend to have a twisted or “sheared” appearance. Examples of force-
free ﬁelds are chromospheric ﬁbrils and penumbral structures near active sunspots
(Sects. 3.7.2 and 5.6.2).
The condition (1.10) can be satisﬁed in three ways: B = 0 (trivial), (i.e., j = 0), or
∇× B = αB
(1.12)
where the scalar α = α(r) in general. The essence of a force-free ﬁeld is simply that
electric currents ﬂow parallel to magnetic ﬁeld lines. Such currents are often called
“ﬁeld-aligned” currents (Chap.2).
The force-free ﬁelds with constant a represent the lowest state of magnetic energy
that a closed system may attain. This has two important consequences. It proves the
stability of force-free ﬁelds with constant a, and shows that in a system in which
the magnetic forces are dominant and in which there is a mechanism to dissipate
the ﬂuid motion, force-free ﬁelds with constant α are the natural end conﬁgura-
tion. In astrophysical plasmas, the dissipation mechanism may be the acceleration
of charged particles to cosmic ray energies.
1.7.3 The Diocotron Instability
One of the outstanding problems in the propagation of electron beams along an axial
magnetic ﬁeld is the breakup of the beam into discrete vortex-like current bundles
when a threshold determined by either the beam current or distance of propaga-
tion is surpassed. The phenomena observed, closely resembles that associated with
the Kelvin-Helmholtz ﬂuid dynamical shear instability, in which vortices develop
throughout a ﬂuid when a critical velocity in the ﬂow is exceeded, with a large inc-
rease in the resistance to ﬂow (Chandrasekhar 1961).
While structural changes in the azimuthal direction are observed in solid, annu-
lar, or sheet beams, it is with thin electron beams that the vortex phenomenon is
most pronounced. Since thin annular beams are easily produced and are capable of
conducting intense currents, they have found widespread application in microwave
generation and accelerators. Conversely, in many applications a cold beam is desired
and the heating of the beam by the onset of instabilities is an undesired property.
The instability leading to the ﬁlamentation of the beam is known as the “slipping
steam” or “diocotron”8 and occurs when charge neutrality is not locally maintained,
for example, when electrons and ions separate. In the steady state equation (1.3) in
cylindrical coordinates is
r−1 d (rEr)

(ne −ni)
(1.13)
8 The term diocotron derives from the Greek διωκειν, meaning “pursue.”

which gives rise to a shear in the drift velocity. The shear (precisely, the axial com-
ponent of the vorticity) is given by
ωs = (∇× v)z = 1
r
∂(rEr/Bz)

(1.14)
where
q = ω2

is called the cross-ﬁeld electron beam parameter (Buneman et al. 1966),

p = nee2/mγε0, and ωγ = ωb/γ = −eB/meγ, where γ is the Lorentz factor
γ =

1 −β 2
z
−1/2, and βz = vz/c for a beam of axial velocity vz. The factor
fe = Zni/ne represents the degree of charge neutralization. For strong magnetic
ﬁeld “low-density” beams (q < 0.1) of thickness Δr, the instability occurs at long
wavelengths
λ = (π/0.4)Δr
(1.16)
or at wavelengths about eight times the beam thickness.
Equations (1.13)–(1.15) are exactly the magnetron equations (cf. “Buneman
Small Amplitude Theory” in Collins, Microwave Magnetrons 1948), except that
ni = 0 in a properly vacuum-pumped magnetron.
Figure 1.20 depicts both the vortices of a 90 kA electron beam etched onto a
carbon witness plate and those of a 58-μA electron beam detected by a sensitive
ﬂuorescent screen. Therefore, in the laboratory, well-deﬁned vortices are found to
occur over some 12 orders of magnitude in beam current. This mechanism was ﬁrst
introduced to explain auroral curtains (Fig. 1.21) by Alfv´en (1950). The diocotron
instability as the cause of the auroral curtains is discussed in Sect. 2.9.8.
1.7.4 Critical Ionization Velocity
If both a plasma and a neutral gas are so thin that collisional momentum exchange is
negligible, one would expect them to move through each other without appreciable
interaction. That this need not be so was suggested by Alfv´en (1942) in his theory
of the origin of the planets and satellites. He introduced the hypothesis that if the
relative velocity exceeds a certain critical value, a strong interaction and rapid ion-
ization of the neutral gas would take place. He further assumed that this “critical
velocity” vc was given by the velocity at which the neutral gas particles with mass
M have a kinetic energy equal to their ionization energy eVi:
1
2Mv2
c = eVi
(1.17)
Table 1.7 summarizes the critical ionization velocity parameters for many ele-
ments while Fig. 1.22 illustrates the gravitational potential energy versus ionization
potential (Alfv´en and Arrhenius 1976).

At the time Eq.(1.17) was proposed, there was no known reason why such a rel-
ation should hold. Nevertheless, the hypothesis was conﬁrmed later in a laboratory
experiment (Fahleson 1961). For many years it remained a mystery, but experiments
have now clariﬁed the phenomenon at least in general terms (Lai et al. 1989). What
is involved is an instability that transfers energy from ions to electrons, so that they
become capable of ionizing. Still, important questions remain (Brenning and Axn¨as
1988).

a Minor elements (abundance 102 −104) are indicated by parentheses; trace elements (abundance
< 102) are indicated by brackets
b The very fact separation processes are active interstellar and circumstellar space makes it dif-
ﬁcult to specify relative abundances of elements except by order of magnitude and for speciﬁc
environments (such ad the solar photosphere, the solar wind at a given point in time, the lunar
crust). The abundances are the average estimated by Urey (1972). Most values are based on carbo-
nanceous chondrites of Type II which form a particularly well analyzed set, apparently unaffected
by the type of differentiation which is characteristic of planetary interiors. Supplementary data for
volatile elements are based on estimates for the solar photoshere and trapped solar wind. All data
are normalized to silicon, arbitrarily set at 106
Meanwhile, critical ionization velocity phenomena have been observed in space
plasma (Haerendel 1982; Torbert 1988). The phenomenon has been invoked in sev-
eral cosmical applications, such as the formation of an ionosphere at the Jovian
satellite Io (Cloutier et al. 1978), the interaction of the solar wind with gas clouds
(Lindeman et al. 1974; Gold and Soter 1976), with comets (Haerendel 1986; Galeev
et al. 1986), with planetary atmospheres (Luhmann 1988), and with the interstel-
lar medium (Petelski et al. 1980; Petelski 1981). Thus, the phenomenon may have
important astrophysical implications. However, these cannot be evaluated in detail

until a full understanding of the phenomenon has been achieved, which is the goal
of rocket experiments. Because the existence of this anomalous interaction has been
so deﬁnitely documented plus the fact that it has been so successfully applied to
the cosmogonic process, should make it interesting to keep in mind in cosmological
contexts, too.
1.8 Diagnosing Cosmic Plasmas
1.8.1 The Electromagnetic Spectrum
For millennia our knowledge of the universe has been based on information received
in the visual octave, 400–800nm, supplemented during the last half-century by in-
frared and radio observations (Fig. 1.23). During the 1970s and 1980s, however,
space research has opened the full spectrum, including the entire infrared region
and the ultraviolet, X ray, and γ ray regions (Fig. 1.24). The full electromagnetic
spectrum is delineated into bands, which generally are designated as follows:
Gamma Ray and X ray. Most emission at these wavelengths is likely to be pro-
duced by electrons with energies in excess of 102 eV. We know that processes
in magnetized plasmas, especially concerning electric ﬁelds aligned by magnetic
ﬁelds, accelerate auroral electrons to keV energies. Similar plasma processes in solar
ﬂares produce energies of 1–10 GeV. Under cosmic conditions, relativistic double
layers (Chap.5) may generate even higher energies in magnetized cosmic plasmas.
Therefore we can assume with some conﬁdence that the X rays and γ rays we
observe derive mainly from magnetized plasmas with energies in excess of 102 eV.
Therefore, we call the picture we get from these wavelengths the high-energy-
plasma universe, or simply, the plasma universe.
High energy magnetized plasmas not only emit X rays and γ rays, but also syn-
chrotron radiation that often falls in lower energy bands, including the optical and
radio regions.
The energy densities of radiation in the γ ray and X ray bands are ∼10−18 and
∼10−16 J m−3, respectively, and may arise from the total contribution of discrete
sources (Sect. 6.6.5). The isotropy of the X ray background is ΔT/T < 10−2.
Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet astronomy satellites have discovered various circumstellar
plasma distributions in association with a variety of stellar objects, from protostars
to highly evolved red giants. The energy density of the cosmic diffuse ultraviolet
background is estimated to be ∼10−15 J m−3.
Visible. Visible light comes from solid bodies such as planets, but to a much larger
extent comes from stellar photospheres, which are typically plasmas with low ene-
rgies – less than 10 eV. Hence the visual universe is almost synonymous with the
low-energy plasma universe (Urey 1959). The energy density of visible light in the
universe is ∼10−15 J m−3.

Fig. 1.23 (Opposite) Cross section through the earth’s atmosphere showing the altitude and the
approximate wavelength coverage of the different spacecraft, rockets, balloons, and ground-based
observatories that make the observations. The solid white line shows the altitude as a function of
wavelength where the intensity of the solar radiation is reduced to half its original value (From
Max 91/courtesy of B. Dennis and R. Canﬁeld (1988) NASA-GSFC)
Infrared. Infrared radiation is emitted from the photospheres of stars. For example,
52 % of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun falls between 100 and
1 mm. The energy density of radiation in the infrared approaches 10−14 J m−3. The
infrared background radiation is a component of the cosmic background radiation
that also includes the submillimeter and microwave backgrounds.
Submillimeter and Microwave. High-power microwave generation on earth bel-
ongs exclusively to devices using relativistic electron beams. The microwaves derive
from naturally occurring beam instabilities or from electromagnetic-induced beam
instabilities caused by cavities or slow-wave structures placed near the beam. For
example, the diocotron instability (Sect. 1.7.3) is responsible for microwave gener-
ation in magnetrons and magnetically-insulated transmission-line oscillators (Felch
1985). Microwaves from beam interactions with slow-wave structures or cavities is
the mechanism used by backward-wave oscillators and relativistic-klystron oscilla-
tors (Sect. 2.7.2).

approximate year when new technology made possible observation in the different regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. As shown, most of the spectrum was not accessible until the mid-1970s
In addition high-power microwaves are generated via the Barkhausen-Kurz, or
reﬂex, mechanism whenever the current carried by the relativistic electrons exceeds
the space charge limiting current (Sect. 2.5.3) causing the formation of virtual cath-
odes or virtual anodes (double layers) (Peratt 1985). A relativistic electron beam
that does not produce microwave radiation is unknown.
These same basic mechanisms are likely to have their natural analogs in cos-
mic plasmas. Coronal loops conducting electric currents on the Sun produce mic-
rowaves, as do electric currents in the lobes of double radio galaxies. The nuclei
of spiral galaxies radiate at microwave frequencies and are even sites of MASER
(microwave ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation) action (Moran 1984).

1.8 Diagnosing Cosmic Plasmas

In our Galaxy water-vapor masers occur in the dusty plasma surrounding newly
formed massive stars.
Measurements in the frequency range 400 MHz–600GHz show a cosmic
microwave background(CMB) that can be ﬁtted to a black body spectrum (Sect. 7.3)
at temperature of 2.73 K (Fig. 1.25).
In the Rayleigh-Jeans region (<120GHz) the radiation is isotropic with a pre-
cision approaching (and in some cases better than) in a scale of 1◦at λ = 7.6 cm
(Berlin et al. 1983). The isotropy is ΔT/T < 10−4 over all angular scales (Fig. 1.26)
(Periiskii and Korolkov 1986).
The energy density of microwaves in the universe is ∼4.5 × 10−14 J m−3.
Radio Wave. The radio wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is further
divided into sub-classiﬁcations.
Like Jupiter and Saturn, the earth is an intense source of long (kilometer) wave-
length radio waves. These waves were discovered by satellites above the ionosphere.
Since their frequency ω ≪ωp, where ωp is the maximum angular plasma frequency
in the ionosphere, they cannot penetrate the ionosphere and so cannot be detected at
ground level. The radiation derives from the polar aurora at high altitudes (auroral
kilometric radiation or AKR). The mean intensity of AKR from earth is 100 MW,
with peak intensities as high a gigawatt.
Fig. 1.25 Spectral brightness vs frequency for the cosmic microwave background measured by
COBE at the north galactic pole. The solid curve is a 2.735±0.06 K blackbody spectrum
Both Jupiter and Saturn radiate at kilometric, hectometric, and decametric wave-
lengths via the synchrotron process (Chap.6). The average power radiated by Jupiter
between 500 and 40 kHz is 6 GW while Saturn produces an average power of 1 GW
between 3 kHz and 1.2 MHz. The planetary radio emissions are superimposed onto
a cosmic radio background (Kaiser and Desch 1984).

36
1 Cosmic Plasma Fundamentals
At VHF frequencies (178 MHz), the radio background radiation has a nonther-
mal, isotropic component whose brightness temperature (Sect. 7.3) is 65 ± 5 K
(Bridle 1967). Reber (1986) has surveyed the southern sky at 2.085 MHz (144 m)
and reports a bright background corresponding to a 3.5 × 106 K blackbody
(Fig. 1.27).

for the dipole effect at 180◦all results are upper levels. Symbols indicate the sources of the data:

USSR; (crosses) Testa Grigia alpine station, Italy; (open triangles) balloon launched from Sicily;
(closed circles) balloons launched from Palestine, Texas, and S˜ao Jos´e dos Campos, Brazil
Because of the uncertainties in radio intensity at ultra-low frequencies, the energy
density of radio waves in the universe is unknown but, nevertheless, appreciable.
1.8.2 In Situ Space Probes
Until the early 1970s, almost everything we knew about the universe had been ob-
tained from information brought to the observer by electromagnetic radiation. Only
a very small part of our knowledge stemmed from material information carriers, be
they in the form of meteorites hitting the surface of the earth, cosmic ray particles,
or material collected by manned or unmanned satellites or from lunar and planetary
landings.
With the advent of earth and interplanetary space probes, this knowledge has
been augmented by in situ measurements in our own solar system. These measure-
ments have often resulted in discoveries that were unsuspected or misinterpreted
from information contained in the electromagnetic spectrum alone. For example,
prior to space probe measurements, it was universally assumed that the outer mag-
netosphere was populated by hydrogen plasma from the solar wind, and therefore
ultimately from the sun. In contrast to this, we now know that the magnetosphere is

ground (corresponding to 3.5 × 106 K black body) with dimming at the center of the Galaxy and

sometimes dominated by oxygen plasma originating in the earth’s own atmosphere.
Electric ﬁelds within the near-earth plasma were generally not thought possible un-
til space probes measured them directly. Their existence was either not inferable by
means of electromagnetic radiation or they have radiation signatures at frequencies
far below that currently measurable on earth.
It is a sobering fact that even after hundreds of satellites had circled the earth,
the generally accepted picture of our space environment was fundamentally wrong
in aspects as basic as the origin and chemical composition of matter in the earth’s
own neighborhood and the existence and role of electric ﬁelds in the magnetosphere
(F¨althammar 1990). This must inspire caution in making assertions about the com-
position and properties of other invisible cosmic objects, whether they be stellar
interiors, interstellar plasma, pulsar magnetospheres, or intergalactic cosmic rays.
The danger of misconception is particularly great for distant astrophysical objects
that will forever remain inaccessible to in situ observation. To avoid this danger, it
is essential to utilize the empirical knowledge of plasma behavior that has been, and
will continue to be, gathered from plasmas in the laboratory and accessible regions
of space.

Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
2.1 History of Birkeland Currents
An electromotive force φ =
 v× B·dl giving rise to electrical currents in conducting
media is produced wherever a relative perpendicular motion of plasma and magnetic
ﬁeld lines exist (Sect. 3.5.2). An example of this is the sunward convective motion of
the magnetospheric plasma that cuts the earth’s dipole ﬁeld lines through the equato-
rial plane, thereby producing a Lorentz force that drives currents within the auroral
circuit. The tendency for charged particles to follow magnetic lines of force and
therefore produce ﬁeld-aligned currents has resulted in the widespread use of the
term “Birkeland Currents” in space plasma physics. Their discovery in the earth’s
magnetosphere in 1974 has resulted in a drastic change of our understanding of
aurora dynamics, now attributed to the ﬁlamentation of Birkeland charged-particle
sheets following the earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld lines into vortex current bundles.
In anticipation of the importance of Birkeland currents in astrophysical settings,
F¨althammar (1986) states:
A reason why Birkeland currents are particularly interesting is that, in the plasma forced to
carry them, they cause a number of plasma physical processes to occur (waves, instabilities,
ﬁne structure formation). These in turn lead to consequences such as acceleration of charged
particles, both positive and negative, and element separation (such as preferential ejection
of oxygen ions). Both of these classes of phenomena should have a general astrophysical
interest far beyond that of understanding the space environment of our own Earth.
Birkeland currents have a long and colorful history. Inspired by his famous terrella
experiments at the beginning of the twentieth century (Fig. 2.1) and by his extensive
studies of geomagnetic data recorded during magnetic storms, the Norwegian scien-
tist Kristian Birkeland (1867–1917) suggested that the aurora was associated with
electric “corpuscular rays” emanating from the sun and deﬂected to the polar regions
of the earth by the geomagnetic ﬁeld. Birkeland recognized that the magnetic distur-
bances recorded on the earth’s surface below the auroral region were due to intense
currents ﬂowing horizontally above. He suggested that these currents, now called
“auroral electrojet” currents, were coupled to vertical currents that ﬂowed along

geomagnetic ﬁeld lines into and away from the lower ionosphere. The system of
ﬁeld-aligned currents suggested by Birkeland is shown in Fig. 2.2a.
Fig. 2.1 Birkeland (left), the founder of experimental astrophysics, is shown here with his assistant,
K. Devik, and his “terrella,” a magnetized globe representing the earth
The existence of magnetic ﬁeld-aligned “Birkeland” currents was disputed
because it is not possible to distinguish unambiguously between current systems
that are ﬁeld-aligned and those that are completely ionospheric from a study of
surface magnetic ﬁeld measurements. Sydney Chapman, the noted British geo-
physicist, developed mathematically elegant models of currents that were contained
completely within the earth’s ionosphere that could adequately account for ground-
based magnetic ﬁeld observations obtained during magnetic storms. Figure 2.2b
shows the “atmospheric current system” developed by Chapman in 1927 (Egeland
and Holtet 1968; Hill 1984; Dessler 1984).
Hannes Alfv´en, the Swedish engineer and physicist, advocated the idea of
Birkeland currents and developed a theory for the generation of these currents by the
solar wind (Alfv´en 1939). Figure 2.2c shows Alfv´en’s diagram for these currents.
The ﬁrst satellite measurements of Birkeland currents were provided by Zmuda
et al. (1966, 1967) with a single axis magnetometer on board the navigation satel-
lite 1963–1938C at an altitude of ∼1,100km. The magnetic disturbances observed
were initially interpreted as hydromagnetic waves, but it was soon realized that their
latitudinal extent was not appropriate for waves and they were interpreted as being
due to Birkeland currents (Cummings and Dessler 1967). Today, Birkeland currents
are routinely measured by a variety of rocket and satellite instruments.

2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
The location, ﬂow direction, and intensity of Birkeland currents have been
studied by several satellites, and a statistical map is provided in Fig. 2.3. This distri-
bution, plotted on an invariant (magnetic) latitude and geomagnetic local time polar
dial, was determined from hundreds of orbits of the TRIAD satellite over the polar
regions (Iijima and Potemra 1976). It shows that there are well deﬁned patterns
of these currents, and these patterns coincide approximately with the auroral zone.
The inﬂowing currents are at latitude 70◦and the outﬂowing currents are at 74◦–78◦
from about noon to midnight, then reverse directions from midnight to noon.
The magnitude and ﬂow direction of Birkeland currents are determined from
the magnetic ﬁeld observations with Maxwell’s equation (1.2), j = (1/μ0)∇× ΔB
(where ΔB is the magnetic perturbation). For currents ﬂowing parallel to the geo-
magnetic ﬁeld and in sheets aligned in the east-west direction (with inﬁnite extent),
this vector formula reduces to the scalar gradient, jz = (1/μ0)∂(ΔBy)/∂x where jz

is the current ﬂowing along the main geomagnetic ﬁeld (in the z direction), ΔBy is
the perturbation in the eastward (y) direction, and x is the northward direction.
Birkeland currents not only heat the upper atmosphere, increasing the drag
on low altitude earth circling satellites, but cause substantial density depletions.
Electric ﬁelds along the dipole magnetic ﬁeld lines can give rise to ﬁeld-aligned
currents that reduce the ionospheric topside electron and ion densities (Block and
F¨althammar 1969). In the topside there is then an excess of ionization in contrast
to low altitudes where recombination dominates. The net effect is an upward ﬂux
of neutral particles that are ionized at high altitudes. Auroral primary particles
are charged particles with the proper sign that have been accelerated downward.
Closure of the global circuit is accomplished by particles with the opposite sign, that
move out of the magnetosphere and precipitate in another region of the ionosphere
with reversed polarity. Current measurements suggest that the supply of plasma from
the solar wind is negligible in relation to the supply of plasma from the closed loop
ionospheric/magnetospheric system.
As an example of a manmade “Birkeland current,” a charged-particle beam in
space undergoing a helical motion along the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is shown in
Fig. 2.4. The physics of this beam behavior are examined in Sects. 2.5.3 and 2.9.7.

bright glow at the lower end of the beams is the accelerator that produced the energetic particles

2.2 Field-Aligned Currents in Laboratory Plasma
In the laboratory, ﬁlamentary and helical structure is a common morphology
exhibited by energetic plasmas. X ray pinhole photographs, optical streak and
framing camera photographs, and laser holograms often show a ﬁlamentary, mag-
netic “rope-like” structure from plasmas produced in multi-terawatt pulse power
generators or in dense plasma focus machines (Fig. 1.2). Often, the cross-sectional
patterns from ﬁlamentation in hollow electron beams are recorded onto observing
screens or witness plates. Regardless of size or current, the patterns are those of
vortices (Figs. 1.20–1.21). In the dense plasma focus the vortices have dimensions
of a few microns while in laboratory electron beams the vortices may be a few
centimeters in diameter. This size variation of 4 orders of magnitude is extended to
nearly 9 orders of magnitude when auroral vortex recordings are directly compared
to the laboratory data. With regard to actual current magnitudes; ﬁlamentation
occurs over nearly 12 orders of magnitude while coarser resolution experiments
show that the phenomena probably transcends at least 14 orders of magnitude, from
microampere to multi-megaampere electron beams.
2.3 Field-Aligned Currents in Astrophysical Plasmas
As far as we know, most cosmic low density plasmas also depict a ﬁlamentary struc-
ture. For example, ﬁlamentary structures are found in the following cosmic plasmas,
all of which are observed or are likely to be associated with electric currents:
1. In the aurora, ﬁlaments parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld are often observed. These
can sometimes have dimensions down to about 100 m (Fig. 1.21).
2. Inverted V events and the in-situ measurements of strong electric ﬁelds in the
magnetosphere (105−106 A, 108 m) demonstrate the existence of ﬁlamentary
structures.
3. In the ionosphere of Venus, “ﬂux ropes”, whose ﬁlamentary diameters are typi-
cally 20 km, are observed.
4. In the sun, prominences (1011 A), spicules, coronal streamers, polar plumes,
etc., show ﬁlamentary structure whose dimensions are of the order 107−108 m
(Fig. 1.10).
5. Cometary tails often have a pronounced ﬁlamentary structure (Fig. 1.8).
6. In the interstellar medium and in interstellar clouds there is an abundance of
ﬁlamentary structures (e.g., the Veil nebula (Fig. 1.13), the Lagoon nebula, the
Orion nebula, and the Crab nebula).
7. The center of the Galaxy, where twisting plasma ﬁlaments, apparently held
together by a magnetic ﬁeld possessing both azimuthal and poloidal compo-
nents, extend for nearly 60 pc (1018 m) (Fig. 1.14).
8. Within the radio bright lobes of double radio galaxies, where ﬁlament lengths
may exceed 20 kpc (6× 1020 m) (Fig. 1.15).

2.4 Basic Equations of Magnetohydrodynamics
47
Regardless of scale, the motion of charged particles produces a self-magnetic
ﬁeld that can act on other collections of particles or plasmas, internally or externally.
Plasmas in relative motion are coupled via currents that they drive through each
other. Currents are therefore expected in a universe of inhomogeneous astrophysical
plasmas of all sizes.
2.4 Basic Equations of Magnetohydrodynamics
2.4.1 General Plasma Fluid Equations
Fundamental equations for the plasma velocity, magnetic ﬁeld, plasma density,
electric current, plasma pressure, and plasma temperature can be derived from
macroscopic averages of currents, ﬁelds, charge densities, and mass densities. In this
“ﬂuid” treatment, the Maxwell-Hertz-Heaviside equations (1.1)–(1.4)are coupled to
the moments of the Boltzmann equation for a highly ionized plasma.
The evolution of the distribution function f(r, p,t) for particles with charge q and
mass m is described by the Boltzmann equation
 ∂
∂t + v· ∂
∂r + q(E + v× B)· ∂
∂p

f (r, p,t) =

(2.1)
which is an expression of Liouville’s theorem for the incompressible motion of par-
ticles in the six-dimensional phase space (r,t). In the ﬂuid description the particle
density, mean velocity, momentum, pressure, and friction are deﬁned by
n(r,t) ≡
	
d3p f (r, p,t)
(2.2)
n(r,t) ¯v(r,t) ≡
	
d3pvf (r, p,t)

where the momentum p and velocity v are related by

The ﬁelds E(r,t) and B(r,t) in Eq.(2.1) are self-consistently solved from
Eqs. (1.1) to (1.4) with

(2.8)
j(r,t) ≡e

Taking the moments

 d3pp of the Boltzmann equation yields the two-
ﬂuid equations (Rose and Clark 1961; Alfv´en and Carlqvist 1967; Chen 1984) for
ions and electrons α = i,e,

(2.11)
These are called the continuity and momentum equations, respectively. The con-
tinuity equation, as written, is valid if ionization and recombination are not impor-
tant. Conservation of linear momentum dictates that
Ri + Re = 0
(2.12)
The two ﬂuid equations are the moments, or averages, of the kinetic plasma
description and no longer contain the discrete particle phenomena such as
double layers from charge separation and synchrotron radiation. Nevertheless,
this approach is useful in studying bulk plasma ﬂow and behavior. A single ﬂuid
hydromagnetic force equation may be obtained by substituting into Eq. (2.11) and
adding to get,
ρm
∂vm
∂t = ρE + j × B−∇p −ρm∇φG
(2.13)
which relates the forces to mass and acceleration for the following averaged
quantities:
ρm = neme + nimi
mass density
jm = neme ¯ve + nimi ¯vi
mass current
vm = jm/ρm
averaged velocity
ρ = neqe + niqi
charge density
j = neqe ¯ve + niqi ¯vi
current density
(2.14)
The ﬁrst term in Eq. (2.14) is caused by the electric ﬁeld, the second term derives
from the motion of the current ﬂow across the magnetic ﬁeld, the third term is due
to the pressure gradient (Eq. (2.14) is valid for an isotropic distribution ∇·P →∇p,
where p ≡nkT), and the fourth term is due to the gravitational potential ϕG. The
near absence of excess charge ρ = e(ni −ne) ≈0, for qi,e = ±e, is a characteristic

2.4 Basic Equations of Magnetohydrodynamics

of the plasma state; however, this does not mean that electrostatic ﬁelds (e.g., those
deriving from Eq. (1.3)) are unimportant.1
Completing the single ﬂuid description is the equation for mass conservation,
∂ρm
∂t + ∇·(ρmvm) = 0
(2.15)
In addition to Eqs. (2.13) and (2.15), we ﬁnd it useful to add the equation for
magnetic induction,
∂B
∂t = ∇× (vm × B)+ 1
μσ ∇2B
(2.16)
obtained by taking the curl of Ohm’s law
j = σ (E + v× B)
where σ is the electrical conductivity (Table 1.6).
2.4.2 Magnetic Reynolds and Lundquist Numbers
The signiﬁcance of Eq.(2.16) in which (μσ)−1 is the magnetic diffusivity, is that
changes in the magnetic ﬁeld strength are caused by the transport of the mag-
netic ﬁeld with the plasma (as represented by the ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side),
together with diffusion of the magnetic ﬁeld through the plasma (second term on
the right-hand-side). In order of magnitude, the ratio of the ﬁrst to the second term
is the magnetic Reynolds number
Rm = μσVclc
(2.17)
in terms of a characteristic plasma speed Vc and a characteristic scale length lc.
A related quantity is the Lundquist parameter
Lu = μσVAlc
(2.18)
where
VA =

√μρm
(2.19)
is the Alfv´en speed. It may be written as the ratio
Lu = τd
τA
(2.20)
1 According to Chen (1985): “In a plasma, it is usually possible to assume ni = ne and ∇·E ̸= 0 at
the same time. We shall call this the plasma approximation. It is a fundamental trait of plasmas, one
which is difﬁcult for the novice to understand. Do not use Poisson’s equation to obtain E unless it
is unavoidable!”

2.5 The Generalized Bennett Relation
A generalized Bennett relation follows directly from Eq. (2.13) and Eqs. (1.1)–(1.4).
Consider a current-carrying, magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned cylindrical plasma of radius a
which consists of electrons, ions, and neutral gas having the densities ne, ni, and nn,
and the temperatures Te,Ti, and Tn, respectively. A current of density jz ﬂows in the
plasma along the axis of the cylinder which coincides with the z-axis. As a result of
the axial current a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld Bφ is induced (Fig. 2.5). An axial electric
ﬁeld is also present. Thus, there exists the electric and magnetic ﬁelds

rected kinetic energy is

(2.34)
Since Eq. (2.23) contains no axially directed energy, it must be argued that there
are conversions or dissipation processes transferring a kinetic beam of energy of
magnitude W||kin into one or several kinds of energy expressed by the positive W
elements in Eq. (2.23):
W||kin = W⊥kin +WEz +WBz +Wk

2.5.2 Alfv´en Limiting Current
Equating the parallel beam kinetic energy to the pinch energy
W⊥kin −μ0
8π I2 = 0
(2.38)
yields the Alfv´en limiting current
IA = 4πε0mec3βγ/e = 17βγ kiloamperes
(2.39)
for an electron beam. This quantity was derived (Alfv´en 1939) in order to deter-
mine at what current level in a cosmic ray beam the self-induced pinch ﬁeld would
turn the forward propagating electrons around. It should be noted that this limit is
independent of any physical dimensions.
Lawson’s (1959) interpretation of Eq. (2.39) is that the electron trajectories
are beam-like when I < IA and they are plasma-like when I > IA. In laboratory
relativistic electron beam (REB) research, Budker’s parameter
νBud = πa2nbe2/mc2 = Ne2/mc2
(2.40)
where nb is the electron density of the beam, ﬁnds wide application in beam and
plasma accelerators. Yonas (1974) has interpreted the particle trajectories as beam-
like for νBud < γ and plasma-like for νBud > γ. The relationship between IA and
νBud is
νBud/γ = I/IA
(2.41)
The Alfv´en limiting current Eq. (2.39) is a fundamental limit for a uniform beam,
charge-neutralized (fe = 1), with no magnetic neutralization (fm = 0, Sect. 2.5.4),
no rotational motion (vφ = 0), and no externally applied magnetic ﬁeld (Bz = 0). By
modifying these restrictions, it is possible, under certain circumstances, to propagate
currents in excess of IA.

2.5.3 Charge Neutralized Beam Propagation

gives
W⊥kin −μ0
8π I2 + 1
2πa2ε0E2
r (a) = 0
(2.42)
which yields2
Imax = IAβ 2 
β 2 −(1 −fe)2−1
, 0 ≤fe ≤1
(2.43)
Depending on the amount of neutralization, the denominator in Eq. (2.43) can
become small, and Imax can exceed IA. However, the unneutralized electron beam
cannot even be injected into a drift space unless the space charge limiting cur-
rent condition is satisﬁed. For a shearless electron beam this is (Bogdankevich and
Rukhadze 1971)
Isc = 17

γ2/3 −1
3/2
1 + 2ln(b/a)
kiloamperes
(2.44)
where b is the radius of a conducting cylinder surrounding the drift space. Thus,
in free space Isc →0 and an unneutralized electron beam will not propagate but,
instead, builds up a space charge cloud of electrons (a virtual cathode) which repels
any further ﬂow of electrons as a beam. Moreover, the space charge limiting current
is derived under the assumption of an inﬁnitely large guide ﬁeld Bz; no amount of
magnetic ﬁeld will improve beam propagation.
2.5.4 Current Neutralized Beam Propagation
For beam propagation in plasma, the electrostatic self-ﬁeld Ez built up by the beam,
efﬁciently drives a return current through the plasma, thus moderating the compres-
sional term μ0I2/8π in Eq. (2.23), so that
W⊥kin −μ0
8π I2 (1 −fm)+ 1
2πa2ε0E2
r (a) = 0
(2.45)
where the magnetic neutralization factor is
fm ≡|Ireturn/I|
(2.46)
From Eq. (2.45) the maximum current is
Imax = IAβ 2 
β 2 (1 −fm)−(1 −fe)2−1
, 0 ≤fe ≤1, 0 ≤fm ≤1.
(2.47)
2 This equation differs from the Alfv´en-Lawson limiting current, Imax = IAβ 2/

β 2 −1+ fe

, bec-
ause of the differing ways in describing charge neutralization (Witalis 1981).

2.5 The Generalized Bennett Relation
55
Thus, depending on the values of fe and fm, the denominator in Eq. (2.47) can
approach zero and the maximum beam current can greatly exceed IA. The effect of
current neutralization is examined further in Sect. 2.9.1.
2.5.5 Discussion
When a charged particle beam propagates through plasma, the plasma ions can
neutralize the beam space charge. When this occurs, Er →0 and, as a result, the
beam constricts because of its self-consistent pinch ﬁeld Bφ. For beam currents in
excess of the Alfv´en limiting current, Bφ is sufﬁcient to reverse the direction of the
beam electron trajectories at the outer layer of the beam. However, depending on
the plasma conductivity σ, the induction electric ﬁeld at the head of the beam (due
to dB/dt dI/dt in Eq. (1.1)) will produce a plasma current Ip = −Ib. Hence, the
pinch ﬁeld
Bφ (r) = μ0
2πr [Ib (r)+ Ip]
(2.48)
can vanish allowing the propagation of beam currents Ib in excess of IA.
Because of the ﬁnite plasma conductivity, the current neutralization will
eventually decay in a magnetic diffusion time τd given by Eq.(2.21). During
this time a steady state condition exists in which no net self-ﬁelds act on the beam
particles. While in a steady state, beam propagation is limited only by the classic
macro-instabilities such as the sausage instability and the hose (kink) instability.
When the beam undergoes a small displacement, the magnetic ﬁeld lags behind
for times of the order τd. This causes a restoring force to push the beam back to
its original position, leading to the well-known m = 1 (for a eimφ azimuthal depen-
dency) kink instability.
2.5.6 Beam Propagation Along an External Magnetic Field
An axially directed guide ﬁeld Bz produces an azimuthal current component Iφ
through Eq. (1.2). This modiﬁcation to the conducting current follows by balanc-

2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
For the case of an axial guide ﬁeld, the axial current Iz is not limited to IA and
depends only on the strength of the balancing Iz (Bz) current (magnetic ﬁeld). In
terms of the magnetic ﬁelds, the current ﬂows as a beam when
Bz >>

(2.51)
Note that Eq. (2.44) still holds; that is, a cylindrical conductor around the electron
beam is necessary for the beam to propagate.
Equation (2.51) ﬁnds application in accelerators such as the high-current betatron
(Hammer and Rostocker 1970). In spite of the high degree of axial stabilization
of a charged particle beam because of, appreciable azimuthal destabilization and
ﬁlamentation can occur because of the diocotron effect (Sect. 1.7.3) (Levy 1965;
Levy and Hockney 1968). This can be alleviated by bringing the metallic wall close
to the beam.
2.5.7 Sch¨onherr Whirl Stabilization
The transverse kinetic energy term W⊥kin in Eq. (2.23) explains an observation made
long ago (Sch¨onherr 1909). High-current discharges conduct more current if the
discharge is subject to an externally impressed rotation vφ. This phenomena can
also be expected in astronomical situations if the charged particle beam encounters
a nonaxial component of a magnetic ﬁeld line that imparts a spin motion to the beam
or if a gas enters transversely to an arc discharge-like plasma.
2.5.8 The Carlqvist Relation
An expression having broad applicability to cosmic plasmas, due to Carlqvist
(1988), may be obtained from Eq.(2.23) if the beam is taken to be cylindrical and
in a rotationless and steady-state condition:
μ0
8π I2 (a)+ 1
2G ¯m2N2 (a) = ΔWBz + ΔWk
(2.52)
Thus, in a straightforward and elegant way, the gravitational force has been
included in the familiar Bennett relation. Through Eq. (2.52), the Carlqvist Rela-
tion, the relative importance of the electromagnetic force and the gravitational force
may be determined for any given cosmic plasma situation. This relation will now be
applied to the two commonest pinch geometries–the cylindrical pinch and the sheet
pinch.

2.5 The Generalized Bennett Relation
57
2.5.9 The Cylindrical Pinch
Consider the case of a dark interstellar cloud of hydrogen molecules ( ¯m = 3 ×
10−27 kg and T = Ti = Te = Tn = 20 K). Carlqvist (1988) has given a graphical rep-
resentation of the solution to Eq. (2.52) for these values and this is shown in Fig. 2.6
for discrete values of ΔWBz. Several physically different regions are identiﬁed in
this ﬁgure.
The region in the upper left-hand part of the ﬁgure is where the pinching force
due to I and the magnetic pressure force due to Bz constitute the dominating forces.
Equation (2.52) in this region reduces to
μ0
8π I2 (a) ≈ΔWBz
(2.53)
representing a state of almost force-free magnetic ﬁeld (Sect. 1.7.2).
Another important region is demarked by negative values of ΔWB. In this region
an outwardly directed kinetic pressure force is mainly balanced by an inwardly
directed magnetic pressure force. Hence the total pressure is constant and Eq. (2.52)
is approximately given by
NkT + ΔWBz ≈0
(2.54)
For yet larger negative values of ΔWB, the magnetic pressure force is neutralized
by the gravitational force so that Eq. (2.52) reduces to
1
2G ¯m2N2 (a) ≈ΔWBz
(2.55)
Another delineable region is where ΔWB = 0, where Eq.(2.52) reduces to the
Bennett relation,
μ0
8π I2 (a) ≈ΔWk (n,T)
(2.56)
Another region of some interest is where the classic Bennett relation line turns
over into an almost vertical segment. Here, the pinching force of the current may be
neglected, leaving the kinetic pressure force to balance only the gravitational force
so that
1
2G ¯m2N2 (a) ≈NkT
(2.57)
This is the Jeans’s criterion in a cylindrical geometry.
The size or radius of the cylindrical pinch depends on the balancing forces. For

of the number of particles per unit length N. The temperature of the plasma is T = 20 K while
the mean particle mass is ¯m = 3×10−27 kg. It is assumed that the plasma does not rotate (ω = 0)
and that the kinetic pressure is much smaller at the border of the pinch than in the inner parts. The
parameter of the curves is ΔWBz, representing the excess magnetic energy per unit length of the
pinch due to an axial magnetic ﬁeld Bz (Courtesy of P. Carlqvist)
K¨uppers (1973) has investigated the case of a REB propagating through plasma.
Space charge neutralization (Er = 0) is maintained when ne +nb = ni. For this case,
the replacements n →nb and T →Tb −Te are made to ΔWk (n,T), where Tb is the
beam temperature and Te is the background plasma electron temperature. For the

2.5.10 The Sheet Pinch
The sheet pinch, which is the plane parallel analog of the cylindrical pinch, is a
geometry of considerable importance in astrophysical plasmas. A current of density
jz(x) ﬂows in the z-direction in a symmetrical slab limited by the planes x = ±d
(orthogonal coordinates x,y,z are adopted). This current induces a magnetic ﬁeld
By(x). There also exists a magnetic ﬁeld in the z-direction, Bz(x), consistent with
the current density jy(x). All quantities are supposed to vary with the x-coordinate
only.
In a similar way as Eq.(2.52) was derived, Carlqvist (1988) uses the force equa-
tion (without the centrifugal term) to obtain the relation
μ0I2 (d)+ 4πG ¯m2N2 (d) = 8(Δ pk + Δ pBz)
(2.61)
for the one-dimensional, charge neutral pinch where
I (d) = 2
	 d
0 jzdx
(2.62)
is the current per unit length of the slab, and
N (d) = 2
	 d
0 (ne + ni + nn)dx
(2.63)
is the number of particles per unit area of the slab. The kinetic pressure and magnetic
pressure difference terms in the slab are, respectively, given by
Δ pk = pk (0)−pk (d)
(2.64)
Δ pBz = pBz (0)−pBz(d)
(2.65)
Equation (2.61) is the one-dimensional analog of (2.52) and Fig. 2.7 is its
graphical solution using the same parameter values as in Fig. 2.6. Comparison of
Figs. 2.6 and 2.7 reveals a striking similarity between the behavior of cylindrical
and sheet pinches.
By means of the theory discussed in Sect. 2.5, in the next section we shall study
the physical conditions in a few different, current-carrying, cosmic plasmas.
2.6 Application of the Carlqvist Relation
2.6.1 Birkeland Currents in Earth’s Magnetosphere
Magnetometer measurements from rockets and satellites show that Birkeland cur-
rents often exist in sheets in the auroral zones, where the current density may be

60
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
as large as j|| ≈10−4 A m−2. The thickness of such sheets is found to range from
a few kilometers to several hundred kilometers. Often the sheets exist in pairs with
oppositely directed currents.
Consider a model of a Birkeland current with a current density jz ≈3 ×
10−5 A m−2 ﬂowing in a magnetospheric plasma slab of half-thickness d = 104 m
(Carlqvist 1988). The mean mass of the electrons and protons in the slab is taken
to be ¯m ≈10−27 kg. At an altitude of a few thousand kilometers above the earth,
ne = ni ≈1010 m−3, T ≈2×103 K, and Bz ≈4×10−5 T. Substituting these values
into Eqs. (2.62) and (2.63), gives
Fig. 2.7 The current per unit length I as a function of the number of particles N in a generalized
Bennett pinch of plane parallel geometry forming a slab. The temperature and mean particle mass
are the same as in Fig. 2.6. It is assumed that n(0) ≈N/d. The parameter of the curves is p1 =
Δ pBz −pk(d) where pk(d) is the kinetic pressure at the border of the slab while Δ pBz denotes
the difference of the magnetic pressure due to Bz between the center of the slab and the borders
(Courtesy of P. Carlqvist)
I (d) ≈6 × 10−1 Am−1
N (d) ≈4 × 1014 m−2
Under steady state conditions, Eq. (2.61) is applicable and its terms have the
magnitudes:
μ0I2 (d) ≈5 × 10−7 Pa
4πG ¯m2N2 (d) ≈1 × 10−34 Pa
8Δ pk < 8pk (0) ≈4 × 10−9 Pa
8Δ pBz < 8pBz(0) ≈5 × 10−3 Pa

2.6 Application of the Carlqvist Relation
61
Hence, the gravitational and kinetic pressure terms may be neglected with respect
to the pinching current and Bz pressure. These values for N(d) and Δ pBz pertain to
the lower far-left region in Fig. 2.7, corresponding to the force-free magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration (Sect. 1.7.2).
For a strong circular aurora, 5,000km in diameter (Fig. 1.18a), the total current
is I = I(d)2πr ≈7 MA.
2.6.2 Currents in the Solar Atmosphere
The solar atmosphere consists of a highly conducting plasma in which vertical
currents of about 1011−1012 A are common in active regions where solar ﬂares
occur. For a current of I = 3 × 1011 A ﬂowing in a ﬁlament of radius a ≤106 m,
jz ≈0.1Am−2. The length of the ﬁlament is l ≤108 m and passes mainly through the
lower corona in a loop connecting two foot-prints in the photosphere. The coronal
plasma density and temperature is taken to be ne = ni ≤1016 m−3 and T ≤100 eV
(106 K) (Table 1.3) and uniformly distributed across the ﬁlament so that differential
kinetic pressure term ΔWk(a) is negligible. Hence,
I (a) ≈3 × 1011 A
N (a) ≈6 × 1028 m−1
Applying Eq.(2.52), the magnitudes of the remaining terms are
μ0I2/8π ≈4 × 1015 Jm−1
G ¯m2N2/2 ≈3 × 10−8 Jm−1
ΔWBz (a) < WBz ≈1 × 1017 Jm−1
for a magnetic ﬁeld Bz ≈0.1 T within the ﬁlament. Gravity is negligible and a force-
free magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration exists.
2.6.3 Heliospheric Currents
The heliospheric current system (Alfv´en 1981) consists of the sun as a unipolar
generator with axial currents ﬂowing out of (or into, depending on the polarity of
the sun) the solar polar regions. These currents fan out and close at great distances
from the sun, probably near the heliopause. The return current ﬂows back towards
(or away from) the sun in a thin and wavy layer near the equatorial plane, eventually
dividing and terminating at high latitudes on the northern and southern hemispheres,
where the currents are then conducted across the sun (Fig. 2.8). The magnitude of
the total current in each of the polar regions is Ip ≈1.5 × 109 A.

62
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
Whether or not the polar current is diffuse or ﬁlamentary is an important problem
for cosmic plasmas.
Example 2.1. Polar currents balanced by axial magnetic ﬁelds. Consider the
case of M ﬁlamentary currents each containing an axial magnetic ﬁeld Bz ≈30 ×
10−4 T (Table 1.3). Each current conducts I/M amperes so that, if M = 1,000, a
ﬁlamental current is I = 1.5×106 A. According to Eq. (2.60), the radius of each ﬁl-
ament is a ≈100 m. If the ﬁlaments are approximately equally spaced a diameter’s
distance from one another, they form a tube of radius of the order of 5 km, each with
a current density jz ≈20 A/m2. If, on the other hand M = 1, I = 1.5 × 109 A and
a ≈100 km. For this diffuse current case, jz ≈0.05 A/m2.
Example 2.2. Polar currents in an axial magnetic ﬁeld balanced by the
thermokinetic plasma. Consider the conducting path to be plasma with n =
2 × 1015 m−3 and T = 100 eV (106 K) (Table 1.3). For this case, M = 1,000 ﬁla-
ments each of which conducts 1.5 × 106 A and, according to Eq.(2.58), each has
a Bennett radius a ≈1.5 km. The ﬁlaments ﬁll a tube of radius of the order of
50 km and each has a current density jz ≈0.2 A/m2. If M = 1,I = 1.5 × 109 A and
a ≈1,500 km. For this diffuse current case, 2× 10−4 A/m2.
2.6.4 Currents in the Interstellar Medium
Currents in the interstellar medium may be one or two orders of magnitude stronger
than solar currents. Consider ﬁrst a single interstellar cloud of density n ≈107 m−3,
linear extent lC ∼1016 m, and temperature T ≈10 K. The total mass MC ≈2 ×
1032 kg corresponds to a single solar mass. Hence, representative values for current
and number density per unit length are
I ≈1013 A
N ≈1039 m−1
Under steady state conditions, the magnitude of the terms in Eq. (2.52) are
μ0I2/8π ≈5 × 1018 Jm−1
G ¯m2N2/2 ≈3.3 × 1013 Jm−1
ΔWk (a) < Wk ≈1.4 × 1017 Jm−1
so that the Bennett relation Eq. (2.56) is applicable. Consider now an interstel-
lar cloud of density n ≈108 m−3, linear extent lC ∼1017 m, and temperature
T ≈10 K. These values are typical of the Orion nebula, where the total mass
MC ≈2 × 1,032 kg corresponds to a 100 solar masses. Hence,
I ≈1014 A
N ≈1042 m−1

2.6 Application of the Carlqvist Relation

Fig. 2.8 Heliospheric circuit. The sun acts as a unipolar inductor producing a current which goes
outward along both the axes and inward in the equatorial plane C and along the magnetic ﬁeld lines
B1. The current closes at large distances B3
Under steady state conditions, the magnitude of the terms in Eq. (2.52) are as
follows:
μ0I2/8π ≈5 × 1020 Jm−1
G ¯m2N2/2 ≈3.3 × 1019 Jm−1
ΔWk (a) < Wk ≈1.4 × 1020 Jm−1
That is, the pinch, gravitational, and kinetic forces are approximately balanced.
The two cases illustrated above are representative of particular values found
in Fig. 2.6.
2.6.5 Currents in the Galactic Medium
By extrapolating the size and strength of magnetospheric currents to galaxies,
Alfv´en (1977) suggests a number of conﬁned current regions that ﬂow through inter-
stellar clouds and assist in their formation. For example, a galactic magnetic ﬁeld of
the order BG ∼10−9−10−10 T associated with a galactic dimension of 1020−1021
m suggests the galactic current be of the order IG = 1017−1019 A. As a natural
extension of the size hierarchy in cosmic plasmas, these currents are thought to
have an axial component parallel to an axial galactic magnetic ﬁeld, in addition to

64
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
the ring or azimuthal current component, so that the galactic currents are galactic-
dimensioned Birkeland currents (Peratt and Green 1983). From Sect. 1.2.6 (also see
Example 6.3), ne = 2 × 103 m−3, T⊥= 3 keV (3 × 107 K), and Bz = 2 × 10−8. The
radius is a ≈17 kpc (0.5 × 1021 m). Hence,
I ≈2.5 × 1019 A
N ≈2.9 × 1045 m−1
Under steady state conditions, the magnitude of the terms in Eq. (2.52) are
μ0I2/8π ≈3 × 1031 Jm−1
G ¯m2N2/2 ≈2.6 × 1026 Jm−1
ΔWk (a) < Wk ≈1.3 × 1030 Jm−1
where it has been assumed that the galactic currents are imbedded in Bz so that ΔWBz
is negligible. Hence, the galactic pinch is balanced by the thermokinetic pressure of
the plasma it contains and, to a lesser extent, by gravity.
For a galactic ﬁeld B ∼10−8 T over a volume V ∼1063 m3 (lG ∼aG ∼1021 m),
the magnetostatic energy Eq. (3.41) is WB ∼1053 J.
2.6.6 Currents in the Intergalactic Medium
One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the existence of supercluster-
sized Birkeland currents comes from the discovery of faint supercluster-scale radio
emission at 326 MHz between the Coma cluster of galaxies and the Abell 1367
cluster (Kim et al. 1989). The radiation’s synchrotron origin implies the existence
of a large-scale intercluster magnetic ﬁeld with an estimated strength of 0.3−0.6 ×
10−10 T (0.3–0.6mG). For the linear dimension l of the source, ∼1.5 Mpc, the
current to produce a ﬁeld of this magnitude is I ∼lB/μ0 ∼0.5 × 1019 A. Further
evidence for such currents is examined in Chaps. 3, 6, and 7.

perturbation of strength ρ1/ρ0 such that the mass density is ρm = ρ0 + ρ1 and the

Based on the assumption leading to Eqs. (2.66) and (2.67), Jeans found that a

tinuously due to G. The critical mass of such a sphere of gas is MJ = πρ0λ 3
J /6.
It should be noted that these results are only applicable for a medium in which the
Lundquist parameter Eq.(1.6) is of order unity or less.
2.7.2 Two-Stream (Buneman) Instability
Consider a plasma in which the ions are stationary vi0 = 0 and the electrons have a
velocity V0 relative to the ions. Let the plasma be cold, T = Te = Ti = 0 and assume
B0 = 0. Under these assumptions, Eqs. (2.15) and (2.13) may be linearized to yield

while in Eq. (2.80) (vi0 ·∇)vi1 = 0. For electrostatic waves E1 = ˆzEei(kz−ωt), and
Eqs. (2.78)–(2.81) may be written as
−iωni1 + ikn0vi1 = 0
(2.82)
(−iω + ikV0)ne1 + ikn0ve1 = 0
(2.83)
−iωn0mivi1 = en0E1
(2.84)
n0me (−iω + ikV0) = −en0E1

Because the unstable waves are high-frequency plasma oscillations, the plasma
approximation (Sect. 2.4.1) cannot be used, and the electrostatic ﬁeld must be
obtained from Poisson’s equation (1.3):
ε0∇·E1 = e(ni1 −ne1)
(2.90)
Substituting ∇· E1 = ikE1, Eq. (2.88), Eq. (2.89) into Eq. (2.90), yields the dis-
persion relation,
1 =

(2.91)
Equation (2.91) has four roots and, under certain conditions, two of these are
complex conjugate. The location of the complex root having a positive imaginary
component is given by (Krall and Trivelpiece 1973)
ω′ = kV0

(ωpe/ωpi)2/3
(ωpe/ωpi)2/3 + 1

(2.92)
The condition for instability is that the right-hand side of Eq. (2.91) be greater
than 1 at ω = ω′, and is
|kV0|2 < ωpe

1 + (ωpi/ωpe)2/33
(2.93)
This is the two-stream, or Buneman, instability (Buneman 1959). Since the sign
of the charge does not appear, Eq.(2.93) can be equally well applied to two electron
streams in a ﬁxed neutralizing ion background, replacing ωpi/ωpe by ωpe1/ωpe2.3
The introduction of thermal effects becomes important only if the thermal velocities
are of the order of V0, in which case the ﬂow can hardly be classiﬁed a beam.
The physical interpretation of Eq. (2.91) is that, because of the Doppler shift
of the plasma oscillations, the ion and electron plasma frequencies can coincide
in the laboratory frame only if it has the proper value. The ion and electron den-
sity ﬂuctuations can then satisfy Poisson’s equation. The electron oscillations have
negative energy; they draw energy from the kinetic energy of the electrons.4 There-
fore, the negative energy electron waves and the positive energy ion waves both can
grow while the total energy of the system remains constant. This type of instabil-
ity ﬁnds application in high-power microwave generation in relativistic klystrons

and in the same direction as the wave, they take energy from it.

68
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
(Godfrey and Thode 1975). A REB is velocity modulated by an rf signal, thereby
producing bunches of accelerated electrons that pass through the slower velocity or
deaccelerated electrons. This produces a two-stream condition. As the bunches pass
through a microwave resonator, they excite the natural mode of the cavity to produce
microwave power.
In space and cosmic plasmas, the two stream condition often exists to produce
electromagnetic radiation (albeit at efﬁciencies far less than laboratory devices), and
may also be the source of double layers in Birkeland currents (Chap. 5).
2.7.3 Sausage and Kink Instabilities
The simple pinch has a number of serious instabilities (Shrafranov 1957). The
sausage (m = 0) instability occurs periodically along the pinch where the magnetic
pressure becomes greater. This causes bulges to appear which result in even greater
inward pressure between them. Ultimately, if the axial current is strong enough, the
pinch can collapse into force-free magnetic plasmoids.
The kink (m = 1) instability produces a helical mode in the pinch. This most
often occurs when a strong axial magnetic guide ﬁeld is present, that is, the pinched
plasma is a Birkeland current. The simulated time evolution of the kink instability
is discussed in Sect. 2.9.2.
2.8 Laboratory Simulation of Cosmic Plasma Processes
The rapid development of high-voltage pulsed power technology in the 1970s and
1980s has made it possible, for the ﬁrst time, to investigate the intense currents, high
voltages, and energetic particles found in space and cosmic plasma. Megaamperes
of current in pulsed beams of electrons and ions with particle kinetic energies in the
range from ∼100keV to several hundred MeV have been achieved. Although this
technology was originally developed for materials testing, X radiography, and nu-
clear weapon effects simulation, it has found widespread use in such diverse ﬁelds
as thermonuclear fusion, high-power microwave generation, collective ion acceler-
ation, laser excitation, and laboratory astrophysics.
A multi-terawatt pulsed-power generator may typically consist of an array of
capacitor banks (called a “Marx bank”), or many kilograms of high explosive on
a magnetic-compression-generator, driving a coaxial pulseline (Fig. 2.9).5 A diode
consisting of an outer anode and a cathode (terminating the inner coaxial conduc-
tor) is attached to the water pulseline through a coaxial vacuum transmission line.
The purpose of the pulseline is to shorten the microseconds-long-pulse generated by
5 The dielectric medium of the Marx bank may be 300,000 L of transformer oil while the pulseline
may contain 400,000 L of deionized water.

Fig. 2.9 A multi-terawatt pulsed-power generator. The diode, that contains the plasma load, is
located at the end of the cylindrical, coaxial, pulse shaping line
the Marx bank, which may contain megajoules of energy, to a 30–60 nanosecond-
long-pulse at the diode, thereby producing a power ampliﬁcation (watts = joules per
second). In this way, space and astrophysical magnitude quantities are generated:
megaamperes of current, megavolts of potential differences, megaelectronvolt par-
ticle energies, and terawatts of power.
2.8.1 High-Current Plasma Pinches
A plasma pinch can be created by attaching thin (few microns thick) wires or thin
cylindrical foils between the cathode and anode, or else injecting gas between the
cathode and anode at the time of pulse arrival.
Unlike most astrophysical pinches, the laboratory pinch is available to in situ
measurement and study. The magnetohydrodynamic evolution is recorded using
streak and framing cameras to record the bulk plasma motion, pulsed-laser holog-
raphy and shadowgraphy to study time resolved morphology, and Faraday rotation
measurements to plot magnetic ﬁeld vectors (Fig. 2.10). The radiation history is
recorded using X ray detectors, spectrum analyzers, pin-hole X ray cameras, and
microwave antennas (Fig. 2.11).
Figure 2.12 shows the time history of a jet of argon gas injected through the
cathode. At time 7 ns the gas is ionized by the arrival of the MV pulse. The images,
recorded in soft X rays, show the ﬂaring out of the hollow gas towards the anode.
At 14 ns the gas is fully ionized and the plasma conduction current is nearly 4 MA,
causing the plasma to pinch. The inward compression of plasma is halted when the

70
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma

raphy and framing camera setups
pinch undergoes a transformation to a force-free state, producing the “plasmoids”
recorded at 21 ns.6 These plasmoids then pair together, sometimes producing spiral
conﬁgurations such as that (barely discernible) at 28 ns.
A detailed study of plasmoid interaction was carried out by Bostick (1956, 1957).
Figure 2.13 shows the time history of spiral formation from plasmoids produced by
plasma guns (Sect. 4.6.2) ﬁred at each other across a magnetic ﬁeld.
The unique possibility of plasma pinches to create ultradense matter, such as that
in the interiors of stars, is investigated in some detail by Meierovich (1984).
6 The term “plasmoid” was coined by W. Bostick (1956) to describe the force-free self-magnetic
ﬁeld carrying entities he experimented with.

2.8.2 Laboratory Aurora Simulations
The magnetized sheet electron beam has been studied in some detail in a very careful
set of experiments carried out by Webster (1957). Webster was able to produce lab-
oratory analogs of the polar aurora in a small, vacuum, anode-cathode arrangement
in which currents as low as 58 μA were conducted and detected (Fig. 1.20). The
experimental setup consisted of a small vacuum tube (Fig. 2.14) that launched a
0.1 × 1.2 cm ﬂat sheet electron beam by means of a slotted grid disk in front of
the cathode. The beam traveled 9.2 cm parallel to a 71 G axial magnetic ﬁeld until it
struck a ﬂuorescent screen anode. The ﬂuorescent screen was made of a thin coating
(1 mg/cm2) of ZnO phosphor.
Figure 2.15 depicts a series of single-frame photographs of the phosphor screen
showing the beam shape at the anode as the beam voltage was increased. Here we
see that the sheet beam rotates as a rigid rod through an angle of about 30◦. Beyond
this angle, the beam begins to fold into charge bunches, producing vortex patterns
on the phosphorus plate. At a certain critical voltage, the vortices disrupt, produc-

ing a violent oscillation. These oscillations have a complex waveform indicating
a rather broadband frequency distribution. The bandwidth increases rapidly with
beam voltage.
2.9 The Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Beams
and Birkeland Currents
Even before its application to plasmas, the particle-in-cell technique was applied to
the study of electron beams in vacuum (Chap. 10). This section is concerned with
the particle-in-cell simulation of electron beams, in the presence or absence of an
external magnetic ﬁeld, propagating through plasma. The beam may be a solid or
hollow cylinder, or a planar sheet, a geometry that happens to be of particular inter-
est to the study of the aurora or of vacuum devices. Thin sheet beams produced by
electrons ejected from cathodes along magnetic lines of force have found a multi-
ple applications on earth (e.g., in cross-ﬁeld microwave generators, backward-wave
ampliﬁers, and in multi-gapped particle accelerators). Furthermore, solid cylindri-
cal beams of electrons traveling a sufﬁcient distance along a magnetic ﬁeld line can
become cylindrical-sheet beams due to a hollowing instability (Ekdahl 1987). For
these applications, the particle-in-cell simulation (PIC) technique has been often
used to study the dynamics of sheets of charged particles (Hallinan 1976; Jones and
Mostrom 1981; Mostrom and Jones 1983). This offers an opportunity to benchmark
the simulation against physical data.

tom in each column. and the beam pinches only at the edge. In contrast, cold beams with a radius
of a few are noncurrent neutralized and exhibit strong pinching
A simulation of complex phenomenon is generally given little credence until
it is “benchmarked” against physical measurements. For this reason, laboratory
measurements and the PIC approach often create a synergism in understanding the
problem at hand. This approach works best when high quality diagnostics methods
are available to guide the simulation.
The beams and Birkeland ﬁlaments simulated in Sect. 2.9 will be found to exhibit
a number of properties which will be pursued throughout the remainder of this
book (Chap.10): pinching of plasma in the presence of a ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁeld
(Chaps. 4 and 5), uniform bulk rotation of the plasma particles indicative of force-

free plasma interiors (when the external ﬁelds are turned off or become negligible),
and the release of electromagnetic radiation via the synchrotron process (Chap.6).
2.9.1 Charge and Current Neutralized Beam Propagation
in Plasma
Consider a cold plasma of electrons and ions of density np = 0.28 cm−3. A beam
of electrons of radius a = 100 km at density nb/np = 0.003 and a risetime of 7 ms
propagates from the left in a simulation region of dimension 500 × 300 km This
problem was simulated with the particle code ISIS (Fig. 2.16). (For this problem the
plasma skin depth parameter λE = c/ωp is 10 km.) The beam is mildly-relativistic
with βγ = 0.2. Because of the background plasma, the beam is charge neutralized
so that fe = 1 and the beam propagates without diverging.

to right through a plasma background. (b) Current density versus radius. The ordinate is in units
of = 1.35 × 10 −5 A/m2. The return current is equal to the beam current out to a radius of 75 km.
(c) Self magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles. (d) Self ﬁeld versus radius. The ordinate is in units of which
corresponds to 0.17 nT. The two curves (b) and (d) are slices at z = 100 and 200 km, respectively,
at t = 10 ms

76
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
As the beam propagates, a return current is set up within the beam by the plasma
electrons. (The electron beam ﬂow is to the right so the beam current is to the left,
i.e., a negative value. The return current has a positive value.) Because of the return
current, the beam is very nearly current neutralized, fm ≈1. The nonneutralized
part of the axial current jz and the nonzero azimuthal ﬁeld Bφ are largely localized
within a few plasma skin depths λE at the beam edge (Fig. 2.16c, d)
2.9.2 Relativistic and Mildly Relativistic Beam
Propagation in Plasma
Consider a cold plasma of electrons and ions of density np = 1 cm−3. A beam
of electrons of radius a = 100 km at density nb/np = 8 × 10−4 and a risetime of
0.2 ms propagates from the left in a simulation region of dimension 1,000 × 300 km
(Fig. 2.17). The beam is mildly-relativistic with βγ = 0.2. For these values the beam
current is I = 200 A, and since the Alfv´en current IA = 17βγ = 2.5 kA, the beam
propagates unhindered, electrically neutralized by the plasma ions (Fig. 2.17a).
Fig. 2.17 Electron beam propagating through a plasma background. The “comb” structure in the
incoming beam is an artifact of every 24th particle being plotted
If the beam current is increased to I = 6.4 kA (nb/np = 0.1), it exceeds IA and no
longer propagates as a beam by time t = 6.6 ms (Fig. 2.17b).
If the beam is relativistic with γ = 2 and nb/np = 0.003, I = 2.6 kA and IA =
34 kA. The beam propagates as shown in Fig. 2.17c. A slight pinching of the beam

front is seen as the current builds up during risetime and before any return current
neutralization can be established.
If the beam current is increased to I = 86 kA (nb/np = 0.1), it rapidly pinches,
converting axial momentum into radial momentum (Fig. 2.17d). Some of the kinetic
energy of the beam electrons (Fig. 2.18 (top)) is transferred to the plasma electrons,
causing the background to be heated. Some of the initially cold plasma electrons
attain energies as high as 1.5 MeV (Fig. 2.18 (bottom)).
2.9.3 Propagation of a Relativistic Beam Bunch Through Plasma
Consider a cold plasma of electrons and ions of density np = 0.28 cm−3. A pulse or
bunch of γ = 40 electrons of radius a = 20 km, length l = 8 km, and density nb/np =
0.02 propagates from the left to right, as shown at time t = 0.5 ms in Fig. 2.19.
The beam pulse produces a “wake ﬁeld” condition (Keinigs and Jones 1987): The
production of negative and positive plasma electron momenta with a concomitant
alternating electric ﬁeld in the wake of the pulse. The peak strength of the induced

ﬁelds Ez and Er are 60 and 20 V/m, respectively. The frequency spectrum of the
wake ﬁeld is sharply peaked at the plasma frequency (4.8 kHz), as is also the case
for much longer beam lengths.
2.9.4 Beam Filamentation
Large radius beams (a ≫λE) propagating through plasma are susceptible to a
ﬁlamentation instability (Molvig et al. 1978; Shannahan 1986; Lee and Thode
1983). The ﬁlamentation instability most readily occurs for large currents. In
addition, relativistic beams are more susceptible to this instability since the time to
ﬁlamentation scales as γ1/2 (Molvig 1975).
Consider a relativistic beam (γ = 20) of radius a = 20λE and nb/np = 0.2. For
this case, the beam current is approximately the same as the Alfv´en current (340 kA)
so that ﬁlamentation is expected.
Figure 2.20 shows the evolution of the beam. As predicted, initially the pinching
occurs only near the beam edge. At later time the beam undergoes a strong ﬁlamen-
tation instability. The solid beam therefore pinches into current carrying ﬁlaments
whose thicknesses are of the order of λE. The actual width is determined by the
factors outlined in Eq.(2.23).

plasma
Strong magnetic ﬁelds can inhibit beam ﬁlamentation, however in most cosmic
plasmas ωb ≤ωp so that ﬁlamentation is expected.
2.9.5 Dynamical Evolution of a Narrow Birkeland Filament
Since Bennett (1934), the dynamic evolution of astrophysical plasma: ﬁlamentation
and rotation, has been the topic of a great many physicists, driven by the experi-
ments of Birkeland. These include Lehnert (1952, 1955), Webster (1955), Webster
and Hallinan (1973), Murty (1961), Yu et al. (1965), Knauer (1966), Knauer and
Poeschel (1966), Bostick et al. (1966), Egeland and Holtet (1968), Carmel and Na-
tion (1973), Davis and Hallinan (1976), Friedman and Hammar (1972), Hallinan
(1970), K¨uppers et al. (1973), Kapetanakos et al. (1973), Kapetanakos (1974), Nardi
et al. (1980), Peratt et al. (1980), Browne (1980), Ivanov et al. (1981), Hill (1984),
Wagner et al. (1983), Potemra (1984), Dessler (1984), Peratt and Snell (1985), Ek-
dahl et al. (1985), Witalis (1986), Lerner (1986), Bhavsar and Ling (1988), Salin-
garos (1988), and Pereira et al. (1989).
Consider a columnar plasma ﬁlament with a Gaussian radial density proﬁle
(Nielsen et al. 1979). A large external magnetic ﬁeld βp ≈0.1 Eq. (10.20) is applied
uniformly throughout the plasma column and the simulation region with the ﬁeld

80

ﬁlament (5 % of the electrons are plotted). (a) Before instability, t = 150ω−1

p
lines parallel to the axis of the column. Additionally, a strong uniform electric ﬁeld is
applied along the column so that signiﬁcant currents are generated (B0/Bsel f ≈4.5).
The simulation is periodic in space so that a particle which moves out of one side of
the simulation domain is returned at the opposite side with its same velocity. Com-
puter economy forces a time compression by setting mi/me = 16 (Sect. 10.6.3). The
number of superparticles per Debye cube is nλ 3
D. This problem was simulated with
the 3D code SPLASH (Chap. 10).
After an initial current buildup, accompanied by visible pinching, a sudden a
dramatic helical mode developed (Fig. 2.21). At this point the ratio of externally
applied magnetic ﬁeld to self-generated magnetic ﬁeld was about 2.5:1. The effect
of the instability was a transport of plasma across B, resulting in a column of rad-
ius somewhat larger than the original radius. The magnetostatic energy WB reaches
its peak at t = 160ω−1
p
(Fig. 2.22a). The onset of the instability converts this into
electrostatic energy WE (Fig. 2.22b). The peak of WE occurs at t = 184ω−1
p . This
energy is subsequently radiated away (Fig. 2.22c, d) as electromagnetic waves. The
frequency of radiation is the bulk rotation frequency which for this simulation is
less than . Since there are still relatively few Debye lengths across the column
(a/λD ≈12), it is probable that the entire column, not just the surface, participates
in a synchrotron radiation process.

2.9.6 Vortex Formation in Thin Cylindrical Electron Beams
Propagating Along a Magnetic Field
Historically, vortex structure and vortex interactions in charged particle beams
have been known since the turn of the nineteenth century when Birkeland ﬁrst
photographed the passage of particle beams through low vacuum in his terrella cath-
ode experiments. Cutler (1956), starting with a perfectly circular 2.1 mA electron
beam was able to record the vortex structure shown in Fig. 2.23 after the beam had
propagated for 300 cm along a 34 G ﬁeld.
The circular beam employed by Cutler was simulated with SPLASH where
q = 0.04 Eq.(1.15), and ωpdt = 0.25 (Peratt 1985). The simulation used 250,000
electrons, 1 % of which are plotted in Fig. 2.24. This ﬁgure shows the time evolution
of the diocotron instability over 190 plasma periods and is in good agreement with
the measured beam pattern.
The e-folding length for instability buildup is (Kyhl and Webster 1956; Pierce
1956)
L = λCBzV/I
(2.94)
where C is the beam circumference, Bz is the magnetic ﬁeld, V is the voltage, and I
is the beam current. Figure 2.25 plots the current required to initiate the instability,
the formation of simple vortex patterns, and the onset of vortex interactions as a
function of the beam length L for a number of experimental and simulation cases.

Fig. 2.27 Evolution of a non-magnetically neutralized 7.5 MeV electron current in a plasma
Also plotted is the linear-theory prediction for instability onset Eq. (2.94). As shown,
the linear theory underestimates the onset by a factor of 2–3.
As shown in Fig. 2.24, the onset of instability occurs when Δr ≈10λD (after
expansion from an initial 2.5 λD beam thickness) for a beam of circumference
314λD. Thus, the number of vortices expected is l = C/λ ≈4, as found in the sim-
ulation.
Microwaves from the following radiation mechanism are observed in the sim-
ulations. The initially concentric ring contours of the electrostatic ﬁeld Er(r) and
the induced magnetic ﬁeld Bφ(r) form cross-sectional “islands” as the nonlin-
ear state evolves (Fig. 2.26, inset). The helical electron ﬂow in a vortex can be
generalized into axial and azimuthal current components, thereby producing both
long-range attractive and short-range repulsive forces between neighboring vortices
(Sect. 3.10.2), in addition to the electrostatic line-charge repulsive force
F ≈+nee(1 −fe)/r
(2.95)
These forces causes the most neighborly ﬁlaments to spiral together in coales-
cence (when fe ≈1) and also produce microwaves from the rapid changes in the
electromagnetic ﬁelds during this process (Fig. 2.26).

2.9.7 Charge-Neutralized Relativistic Electron Beam Propagation
Along a Magnetic Field
Consider the propagation of beam of 7.5 MeV electrons through a plasma of
equal numbers of electrons and ions in the presence of an axial magnetic ﬁeld.
To simulate this case, we choose ωpdt = 0.25, λD/Δ = 0.1, mi/me = 40,
Ti/Te = 1.0, and an axial magnetic ﬁeld of strength ωc = 1.0ωp. The beam
radius is rb = 3Δ and the beam density is nb/Δ3 = 3.0. For 7.5 Mev electrons,
γ = 1 + 7.5MeV/0.511MeV = 15.8 and βz = 0.998.
For the background plasma we choose rp = 5Δ and ion and electron densities
ni/Δ3 = ne/Δ3 = 0.4. Both the beam and background plasmas are given Gaussian
density proﬁles.
Figure 2.27 shows the end and side views of the beam and plasma evolution
versus timestep number. The ﬁrst frame (1ωp) depicts the initial simulation setup.
Because the background plasma is tenuous and the beam is thin, the beam is not
current neutralized and pinches to a minimum radius rb ≈Δ within 25ω−1
p . Once

vortexing. The length of the arrows indicate relative ﬁeld strength while direction gives the polar-
ization. These frames coincide with those of Fig. 2.28
this “steady state” is reached, small amplitude long wavelength perturbation growth
sets in, causing the beam to go unstable. This instability leads to a well-deﬁned
helical mode shown in the last frame at 125ω−1
p .
2.9.8 Numerical Aurora Simulations
A simulation of the laboratory aurora experiment of Sect. 2.8.2 is shown in Fig. 2.28.
The parameters used in this simulation are q = 0.04,ωpdt = 0.25, and w/Δx, where
w is the width of the beam. To simulate the continuously increasing voltage applied
to the beam, the acceleration parameter Ez/cBz was set to 0.05. The constant electric
ﬁeld causes the electrons to accelerate in the −z direction and the ions to accelerate
in the +z direction, thereby producing a time-increasing beam current, in mimicry
of increasing the voltage in the laboratory experiment. The simulated beam patterns
shown in Fig. 2.28 are to be compared to Fig. 2.15. Here we again see an essentially
rigid rotor rotation predicted by linear theory until vortices develop on the beam.

88
2 Birkeland Currents in Cosmic Plasma
The simulation allows an in-depth study of the other beam parameters and
Fig. 2.29 shows the time evolution of the self-consistent magnetic ﬁeld produced
by the beam. The “magnetic storm” shown corresponds to the beam proﬁles
of Fig. 2.28.

Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Plasma
3.1 History of Magnetism
Our knowledge of magnetism and magnetic phenomena is as old as science itself.1
According to the writings of the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), the
attractive power of magnets was known by Thales of Miletus, whose life spanned
the period 620–546 B.C. It was not until the sixteenth century, however, that any
signiﬁcant experimental work on magnets was performed. During this century the
English physician Gilbert (1544–1603) studied the properties of magnets, realized
that a magnetic ﬁeld existed around the earth, and even magnetized an iron sphere
and showed that the magnetic ﬁeld around was similar to that around the earth.
Several other workers also contributed to the knowledge of magnetism during this
same period.
The eighteenth century was a period of considerable growth for the theory and
understanding of electrostatics. It is therefore not surprising to ﬁnd that in the
eighteenth century the theory of magnetism developed along lines parallel to that
of electrostatics. The basic law that evolved was the inverse-square law of attrac-
tion and repulsion between unlike and like magnetic poles. Indeed, it would have
been difﬁcult for the theory to develop along any other path since batteries for
producing a steady current were nonexistent. With the development of the voltaic
cell by Volta (1745–1827), it was not long before the magnetic effects of currents
were discovered by Oersted in 1820. This was followed by the formulation by
Biot (1774–1862) and Savart (1791–1841), of the law for the magnetic ﬁeld from
a long straight current-carrying wire. Further studies by Amp´ere (1775–1836) led
to the law of force between conductors carrying currents. In addition, Amp´ere’s
studies on the magnetic ﬁeld from current-carrying loops led him to postulate that
magnetism itself was due to circulating currents on an atomic scale. Thus the gap
1 There are many indications that magnetism played a role at far earlier times. For example, small
magnetized metal foils ‘ﬁshes’ ﬂoating in a bowl of oil may have been used as compasses by Asian
and Paciﬁc sailors.

3 Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Plasma
between the magnetic ﬁelds produced by currents and those produced by magnets
was effectively closed.
Today it is expedient to base our entire theory of magnetism and static mag-
netic ﬁelds on the work of Biot, Savart, and Amp´ere. A formulation in terms of
ﬁelds produced by currents or charges in motion can account for all known static
magnetic effects. The magnetic effects of material bodies is accounted for by equiv-
alent volume and surface currents. The main effort of the following sections will
be devoted to the magnetic effects of currents, since this provides us with a general
foundation for the understanding of all static magnetic phenomena. Amp´ere’s law
of force between two closed current-carrying conducting loops will be elevated to
the position of the fundamental law or postulate from which we shall proceed (Elliot
1966; Fujimoto 1987; Krause et al. 1989a,b; Panofsky and Phillips 1962; Plonsey
and Collin 1961; Smythe 1950; Stratton 1941; Acu˜na and Ness 1975; Thompson
and Luessen 1986; Voigt 1988 and Woltjer 1958).
3.2 The Magnetic Interaction of Steady Line Currents
The magnetic interaction of currents is best described in terms of an experimentally
established interaction in vacuum that is analogous to the electrostatic Coulomb’s
law. The mathematical generalization of the results of Amp´ere’s experiments, which
gave the force between two current-carrying elements, as shown in Fig. 3.1, is
F21 = μ0
4π

c1,c2
I2dl2 × (I1dl1 × ˆr)
R2
(3.1)
The vector force F21 (newtons) is the force exerted on the conducting loop C2 by
C1, as caused by the mutual interaction of the currents I1 and I2. The vector distance
from dl1 to dl2 is r2 −r1 = Rˆr, where ˆr is a unit vector directed from x1,y1,z1 to
x2,y2,z2 and
R = [(x2 −x1)+ (y2 −y1)+ (z2 −z1)]1/2 .
Equation (3.1) reveals the inverse-square-law relationship. The differential
element of force dF21 between I1dl1 and I2dl2 may be regarded as given by the
integrand in Eq. (3.1) and is
dF21 = μ0I1I2
4πR2 dl2 × (dl1 × ˆr)
(3.2)
The triple-vector product may be expanded to give
dF21 = μ0I1I2
4πR2 [(dl2 · ˆr)dl1 −(dl2 ·dl1) ˆr]
(3.3)
One should note that Eqs. (3.2) or (3.3) do not correspond to a physically realiz-
able condition since a steady-current element cannot be isolated. All steady currents
must ﬂow around continuous loops or paths since they have a zero divergence.

3.3 The Magnetic Induction Field
95
A further difﬁculty with relation (3.2) or (3.3) is that it is not symmetrical in I1dl1
and I2dl2. This superﬁcially appears to contradict Newton’s third law, which states
that every action must have an equal and opposite reaction (i.e., the force exerted
on I2dl2 by I1dl1 is not necessarily equal and opposite to the force exerted on I1dl1
Fig. 3.1 Illustration of Amp´ere’s law of force
by I2dl2). However, if the entire closed conductor, such as C1 and C2, is considered,
no such difﬁculty arises and Newton’s law is satisﬁed.
3.3 The Magnetic Induction Field
Equation (3.1) can be separated into a ﬁeld force and a ﬁeld,
F21 =

C2
I2dl2 × B21
(3.4)
B21 = μ0
4π

C1
I1dl1 × ˆr
R2
(3.5)
Equation (3.1) may be thought of as evaluating the force between current-
carrying conductors through an action-at-a-distance formulation. In contrast,
Eq. (3.4) evaluates the force on a current loop in terms of the interaction of this
current with the magnetic ﬁeld B, which in turn is set up by the remaining current in
the system. The current-ﬁeld interaction that produces F21 in Eq. (3.4) takes place
over the extent of the current loop C2, while the magnetic ﬁeld B21 depends only on
the current and geometry of C1 which sets up the ﬁeld.

96
3 Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Plasma
One of the advantages of the ﬁeld formulation of Eq. (3.5) is that when B is
known, this relation permits one to evaluate the force exerted on a current-carrying
conductor placed in the ﬁeld B without consideration of the system of currents which
give rise to B. Equation (3.5) is the law based on the experimental and theoretical
work of Biot and Savart and is therefore usually called the Biot-Savart law. Since
this law may also be extracted from Amp´ere’s law of force, it is sometimes referred
to as Amp´ere’s law as well.
A charge q moving with a velocity v is equivalent to an element of current
Idl = qv and hence in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld experiences a force F
given by
F = qv× B
(3.6)
This force is called the Lorentz force, and Eq. (3.6) is often taken as the deﬁning
equation for B.
In practice, one does not always deal with currents ﬂowing in thin conductors,
and hence it is necessary to generalize the deﬁning equation (3.5) for B so that it will
apply for any arbitrary volume distribution of current. The steady-current ﬂow ﬁeld
does not diverge, and all ﬂow lines form closed loops. If the direction is associated
with a current density j, rather than a short length dl, then the total current is jdS,
where dS is the differential cross-sectional area through which the current ﬂows.
The total current contained in a volume V will therefore produce a ﬁeld B given by
B = μ0
4π
	
V
j × ˆr
R2 dV
(3.7)
where the integration is over all source coordinates x,y, and z and dV is an element
of volume dSdl. For a surface current jS amperes per meter ﬂowing on a surface S,
a similar derivation shows that the ﬁeld produced is given by
B = μ0
4π
	
S
jS × ˆr

(3.8)
The use of Eqs. (3.4), (3.5), (3.7), or (3.8) is mathematically cumbersome for
all but the simplest geometries. For this reason, three-dimensional computer codes
utilizing Eqs. (3.4) and (3.5) are generally called upon to determine the forces and
magnetic ﬁelds associated with complex conductor geometries. A particularly useful
technique for solving magnetostatic problems having cylindrical geometry makes
use of Amp´ere’s circuital law,
	
S ∇× B·dS =

(3.9)
This equation states that the line integral of B·dl around any closed contour C is
equal to μ0 times the total net current passing through the contour C.

3.3.1 Field from an Inﬁnite Conductor of Finite Radius
Consider an inﬁnite conductor of radius a with total current I (Fig. 3.2). The current
density j is equal to I/πa2 and is uniform over the cross section of the conduc-
tor. From symmetry considerations the ﬁeld B only has a component Bφ, which is
a function of r only. Using Amp´ere’s circuital law equation (3.9) and integrating
around a circular contour of radius r gives

(3.11)
A plot of the intensity of Bφ as a function of r is given in Fig. 3.3.
3.3.2 Force Between Two Inﬁnite Conductors
Consider two thin inﬁnite conductors which are parallel and spaced at a distance d.
The currents ﬂowing in the conductors are I1 and I2 as in Fig. 3.4. From Eq. (3.11)
the magnetic ﬁeld at C2 due to C1 has a φ component only and is given by
Bφ = μ0I1
2πd
(3.12)
The force exerted on C2 per unit length is given by Eq. (3.4) and is
F21 = I2ˆz× Bφ ˆφ = −μ0I1I2
2πd
ˆr
(3.13)
When I1 and I2 are in the same direction, the two conductors experience an att-
ractive force. When I1 and I2 are oppositely directed, the conductors repel each
other.
The fact that two straight parallel conductors exert forces of attraction or repul-
sion on one another is made the basis of the deﬁnition of the ampere in the mks
system. The ampere is deﬁned as follows:

98
3 Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Plasma
Fig. 3.2 An inﬁnitely long wire with a current I and self-consistent ﬁeld Bφ
Fig. 3.3 Magnetic ﬁeld variation across a plasma ﬁlament of radius 2a
One ampere is that unvarying current which, if present in each of two parallel conductors
of inﬁnite length and one meter apart in empty space, causes each conductor to experience
a force of exactly 2×10−7 newtons per meter of length.
It follows from this deﬁnition that the numerical value of μ0 in the rationalized
mks system, is exactly 4π × 10−7 or, to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures, μ0 = 12.57 × 10−7
webers/amp-m.
3.4 The Vector Potential
If, in Eq.(3.7), we replace ˆr/R2 by −∇(1/R), the integrand becomes −j×∇(1/R).
The vector differential operator ∇affects only the variables x,y, and z, and since j
is a function of the source coordinate x′,y′,z′ only, this latter relation may also be

3.4 The Vector Potential
99
Fig. 3.4 Two parallel current-carrying ﬁlaments
written as follows: −j × ∇(1/R) = ∇× (j/R) [and ∇× (j/R) = (1/R)∇× j −j ×
∇(1/R) = −j×∇(1/R)] since ∇× j = 0. Thus, in place of Eq. (3.7) we may write
B(x,y,z) = ∇× μ0
4π
	
V
j(x′,y′,z′)
R
dV
(3.14)
Equation (3.14) expresses the ﬁeld B at the point (x,y,z) as the curl of a vector
potential function given by the integral. From Eq. (3.14), the deﬁnition of the vector
potential function, denoted by A, is
A(x,y,z) = μ0
4π
	
V
j(x′,y′,z′)

(3.15)
The integral for A is a vector integral and must be evaluated by decomposing the
integrand into components along the coordinate axis. Having computed A, the ﬁeld
B is obtained by taking the curl of A:
B = ∇× A
(3.16)
The integral for A is easier to evaluate than the original expression equation (3.7)
for B, and since the curl operation is readily performed, the use of Eq. (3.15) as an
intermediate step provides us with a simpler procedure for ﬁnding B.
3.4.1 Field from a Circular Loop and Force Between
Two Circular Loops
Consider a circular conducting loop carrying a current I. The radius of the loop is
a and it is located in the xy plane at the origin, as in Fig. 3.5. Of course a seat of
electromotive force (emf) is necessary to maintain the current, and one may either

100

imagine the turn cut and a small seat of emf inserted, or consider that current is led
into and out of the turn through two wires side by side. Using Eq. (3.15), we must

3.5 Quasi-stationary Magnetic Fields
To complete a discussion of magnetostatics, it is necessary to derive an expression
for the stored magnetic energy in a cosmic network. This will then make a full dis-
cussion of inductance and also a more powerful technique for determining forces
between current-carrying circuits, possible. In order to determine an expression for
stored magnetic energy due to time-stationary currents, it is necessary to know
something about time-varying currents and time-varying magnetic ﬁelds. Conse-
quently, this section starts with a statement about Faraday’s law of induction.
3.5.1 Faraday’s Law
If we consider any closed stationary path in space which is linked by a changing
magnetic ﬁeld, it is found that the induced voltage around this path s is equal to the
negative time rate of change of the total magnetic ﬂux through the closed path. Let
C denote a closed path as in Fig. 3.6. The induced voltage around this path is given
by the line integral of the induced electric ﬁeld around C and is

where S is any surface with C as its boundary. Thus the mathematical statement of
Faraday’s law is

C
E ·dl = −∂
∂t

S
B·dS
(3.29)
Basically, the law states that a changing magnetic ﬁeld will induce an electric
ﬁeld. The induced electric ﬁeld exists in space regardless of whether a conductor
exists or not. When a conducting path is present, a current will ﬂow, and we refer
to this current as an induced current. Faraday’s law is the principle on which most
electric generators operate. Note that the electric ﬁeld set up by a changing magnetic
ﬁeld is nonconservative, as Eq. (3.29) clearly indicates. The changing magnetic ﬁeld
becomes a source for an electric ﬁeld.
3.5.2 Motion Induced Electric Fields
Whenever a conductor moves through a static magnetic ﬁeld, a voltage is induced
across the conductor. This voltage is in addition to that calculated by Eq. (3.29).
The magnitude of this voltage may be found from the Lorentz force equation (3.6).
The force is seen to act in a direction perpendicular to both v and B. The interpreta-
tion of the Lorentz force gives rise to the concept that an observer moving through

3.5 Quasi-stationary Magnetic Fields
103
a static magnetic ﬁeld also sees, in addition to the magnetic ﬁeld, an electric ﬁeld.
A unit of charge moving with the observer appears to be stationary, and any force
experienced by that charge is ascribed to the existence of an electrostatic ﬁeld. But
a force is experienced and is given by Eq. (3.6). Consequently, in the moving refer-
ence frame, this fact is interpreted as revealing the existence of an electric ﬁeld E
given by
E = F
q = v× B
(3.30)
Equation (3.30) gives an alternative and more general method of evaluating the
induced voltage in a moving conductor. As an example consider a cylindrical con-
ductor moving with a velocity v through a uniform ﬁeld B, as in Fig. 3.7, where
B is orthogonal to v. Each electron in the conducting medium experience a force
F = −evB which tends to displace the electrons along the conductor in the direction
shown. When an equilibrium state is reached, the process stops, and the conductor is
left polarized as shown with an electrostatic force equal and opposite to the Lorentz
force. In this case, E = −vB. The induced voltage between the ends of the conductor
is deﬁned by
ϕ =
P2
	
P1
E ·dl
(3.31)
The induced voltage caused by motion of a conductor through a magnetic ﬁeld
is called motional emf.
3.5.3 Faraday Disk Dynamo
The Faraday disk dynamo is illustrated in Fig. 3.8. It consists of a circular conduct-
ing disk rotating in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. Brushes make contact with the disk
at the center and along the periphery. The magnitude of the induced voltage is found
from the Lorentz force, Eqs. (3.30) and (3.31). An electron at a radial distance r from
the center has a velocity ωr and hence experiences a force eωrB directed radially
outward. The electric ﬁeld acting on the electron at equilibrium is also ωrB but is
directed radially inward. The potential from the center to the outer rim of the disk is
thus
ϕ =
d
	
0
E (r)dr = −ωB
d
	
0
rdr = −ωBd2
2
(3.32)
The value computed from Eq. (3.32) is the open-circuit voltage of the Faraday
disk dynamo and therefore also represents the emf of the generator.

magnetic ﬁeld

3.6 Inductance
Consider a single current-carrying loop in which a constant current has been estab-
lished. This current produces a magnetic ﬁeld. If the current is caused to change,
so will the magnetic ﬁeld. But this means that the total ﬂux linking the loop also
changes and, by Faraday’s law, a voltage is induced in the loop. The self-induced
voltage always has a polarity that tends to oppose the original change in current. For
example, if the current begins to decrease, the induced voltage acts in a direction
to offset this decrease. This property of a single circuit is known as self-inductance.
The similar effect of a changing current in one circuit producing an induced voltage
in another circuit is known as mutual inductance. Mathematically, inductance may
be deﬁned in terms of ﬂux linkages. If ψ12 is the magnetic ﬂux linking circuitC2 due
to a current I1 ﬂowing in circuit C1 (Fig. 3.9), the mutual inductance L12 between
circuit C1 and C2 is deﬁned by

3.7 Storage of Magnetic Energy
105
Fig. 3.9 Illustration of two circuits and their relative displacement (L12 negative)
L12 = flux linking C2 due to current in C1
current in C1
= ψ12
I1
(3.33)
The self inductance L11 of circuit C1 is deﬁned in a similar way; that is,
L11 = flux linking C1 due to current in C1
current in C1
= ψ11
I1
(3.34)
The mutual inductance between C1 and C2 may be deﬁned by
L21 = ψ21
I2
(3.35)
It can be shown that L12 = L21 so that Eqs. (3.33) and (3.35) are equivalent.
This is a statement of the reciprocity theorem. The above deﬁnition of inductance is
satisfactory only for quasi-stationary magnetic ﬁelds where the current and the mag-
netic ﬁeld have the same phase angle over the whole region of the circuit. At high
frequencies the magnetic ﬁeld does not have the same phase angle over the whole
region of the circuit because of the ﬁnite time required to propagate the effects of a
changing current and ﬁeld through space. A more general deﬁnition in terms of the
magnetic energy associated with a circuit will be given in the following section.

3.7.2 In Situ Storage in Force Free Magnetic Field Conﬁgurations
The storage of energy in the force-free magnetic ﬁeld (Sect. 1.7.2) can be thought
of as a slow process where the ﬁeld evolves through a sequence of force-free con-
ﬁgurations, each time ending up in a higher energy state (Tandberg-Hanssen and
Emslre 1988). An example of this slow process is in the photosphere and lower
chromosphere of the Sun, where the energy of the plasma motion dominates the
magnetic energy and, therefore, the ﬁeld is swept passively along with the plasma.
This situation is characterized as a high-β plasma; i.e., the parameter
β =
gas pressure
magnetic pressure = 2μ0nkT
B2
(3.42)
is large (β ≫1). Higher up in the corona where the density is so small that
the magnetic pressure dominates, we have a low-β plasma, and the magnetic
ﬁeld must take on a force-free character (Gold 1964) as it slowly evolves. This

magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) process is possible since the timescale for the “wind-
up” is days or weeks, while the ﬁeld adjustment at any stage takes place with the
Alfv´en speed equation (2.19), leading to timescales of the order of seconds. If α is
constant in time and space, we can take the curl of Eq. (1.12) and ﬁnd
∇2B+ α2B = 0
(3.43)
which is the vector Helmholtz equation. This linear problem then is completely
solvable (Chandrasekhar and Kendall 1957; Ferraro and Plumpton 1966; Nakagawa
and Raadu 1972). Using Eq. (3.43) and the observed boundary conditions in the
form of the value of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld (from magnetograph observa-
tions), we can compute the structure of the force-free ﬁeld and the resulting stored
magnetic energy. In these cases, α is adjusted until reasonable agreement is obtained
with observations. With the availability of complete vector magnetic ﬁeld observa-
tions, the ﬁeld calculations have improved since If α can be determined with higher
precision from Eq. (1.12) with the expression
α = (∇× B)·B
B2
(3.44)
In general, the parameter α is not constant in space and time, that is
α = α(r,t)
(3.45)
so that Eq. (3.43) is nonlinear, and the problem must be solved by computer
simulation.
3.8 Forces as Derivatives of Coefﬁcients of Inductance
The force between separate current-carrying loops or circuits may be evaluated by
Amp´ere’s law of force. However, an alternative method that is much easier to apply
in many cases may also be used. This alternative method essentially consists of
evaluating the derivatives of mutual-inductance coefﬁcients with respect to arbitrary
virtual displacements of the circuits with respect to each other (see, e.g., Fig. 3.9).
When circuits are displaced relative to each other, the mutual inductance, and hence
the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld, changes. The change in the magnetic energy
is in turn related to the work done against the forces of the ﬁeld in displacing the
circuits. If we have N circuits and displace the jth circuit by an amount drj, the
force Fj exerted on Cj by all the other circuits is given by

3.9 Measurement of Magnetic Fields in Laboratory Plasmas
B-Dot Probes. The simplest way to measure the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of a
point in space is to use a small coil of wire (Fig. 3.10). In a uniform, time-varying
magnetic ﬁeld, the voltage induced in the coil is
Fig. 3.10 B-Dot probe and integrating circuit
Φ = NAdB
dt ≡NA ˙B

3.10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Interacting Currents
109
where N is the number of turns in the coil of area A and the dot denotes the time
derivative of B. If B, rather than ˙B, is the desired quantity, an integrating circuit may
be used to obtain a voltage proportional to the ﬁeld
Φ = NAB
RC
where RC is the time constant of the integrator.
Rogowski Coil. Many different variations of the B-dot probe are available. One of
the most widespread is the Rogowski coil. This is a solenoidal coil whose ends are
brought around together to form a torus as shown in Fig. 3.11a. Consider a coil of
uniform cross sectional area A with a constant number of turns per unit length n.
If the magnetic ﬁeld varies little over a one-turn spacing, i.e., |∇B|/B ≪n , the
total ﬂux linkage by the coil equation (3.28) can be written as an integral over the
individual turns:
ψ = n

l
	
A
B·dldA
where dl is the line element along the solenoidal axis as depicted in Fig. 3.11b.
The purpose of the return wire threading the loops is to exclude the contribution of
ﬂux passing through the torus center. Changing the order of integration and using
Eq. (3.9) gives
ψ = nAμ0I
The signal voltage from the Rogowski coil is then
ϕ = dψ
dt = nAμ0 ˙I
The Rogowski coil provides a direct measurement of the total current, particle
and displacement, ﬂowing through its center. Its signal is independent of the distri-
bution of the current within the loop. The merit of the Rogowski coil is that it need
not come into contact with the current whose ﬁeld it measures. This is an important
consideration for intense relativistic electron beams.
Internal Magnetic Field Probes. It is often possible to use internal sensing coils in
tenuous nonenergetic plasmas. Stenzel and Gekelman (1981) have used such probes
with great success to measure the time evolution of magnetic ﬁelds in all three dim-
ensions in plasmas contained in large vacuum chambers.
3.10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Interacting Currents
The basic geometry under study is shown in Fig. 3.12. This ﬁgure depicts two
current-conducting plasma ﬁlaments aligned along a magnetic ﬁeld B0 and
separated by a distance comparable to the diameters of the ﬁlament. The plasma is
charge neutral ne = ni and initially thermalized at a temperature vthx = vthy = vthz

for both ions and electrons. The density distribution across a column may either be
a ﬂat proﬁle, a Bennett proﬁle, a Gaussian proﬁle, or any arbitrary proﬁle ne,i(r).
The conduction of current is initiated by placing an electric ﬁeld E = E0 along
each column. This then produces a current which increases with time. Whether
or not a ﬁlament pinches, or is simply conﬁned by the self-consistent azimuthal
magnetic ﬁeld Bφ, depends on the strength of E0. Solution of the relative motion of
the two ﬁlaments and their reconﬁguration by the Biot-Savart forces requires a 3D
particle-in-cell treatment. The codes SPLASH and TRISTAN have been applied to
this geometry (Chap.10).
3.10.1 Simulation Setup
We choose a temperature typical of cosmic Birkeland ﬁlaments, a few kiloelec-
tronvolts, by setting the initial dimensionless simulation parameters (Sect. 10.8) to
ωpdt = 0.25,λD/Δ = 0.25, and cdt/Δ = 1.0. A ﬁeld-aligned Birkeland ﬁlament is
established by means of the parameter ωc0/ωp = 1.5. For this choice of parameters,

3.10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Interacting Currents
111
βth = 0.0625 (Eq. (10.19)) and, for Te = Ti,βp = 0.0069 (Eq. (10.20)). Current
ﬂow within the ﬁlaments is initiated by setting Ez/Bz = 0.01c, so that 0 ≤βz ≤1
(Eq. (10.18)). For SPLASH, the radius of each ﬁlament is 3Δ and the center-to-
center separation is 11Δ, while for TRISTAN the radius and separation are 12Δ
and 44Δ, respectively. (Because of the spline interpolation technique, the particle
space-time resolution is approximately eight times better than the cell width Δ.)
3.10.2 Initial Motion of Current Filaments
Initially, the Biot-Savart force between ﬁlaments conducting currents can be approx-
imated by Eq. (3.13). However, because of the axial magnetic ﬁeld B0, the particles
spiral as they drift or accelerate in the z-direction, thereby producing a generalized
current I = ˆzIz + ˆφIφ. The force between the Iφ currents can be approximated by
Eq. (3.26). Figure 3.13 illustrates the total Biot-Savart force as a function of the
spacing between helical current ﬁlaments. As shown, the electromagnetic forces
between ﬁlaments are ordered as −R−1
12 (long-range attractive) and +R−3
12 (short
range repulsive). During long-range attraction, the motion of either ﬁlament may be
approximately described by the equation 111

(dark gray lines) are long-range attractive, while the counter-parallel azimuthal currents (light gray
rings) are short-range repulsive. A third force, long range electrostatic repulsion, is found if the
electrons and ions are not present in equal numbers. These forces cause the currents to form sheets,
ﬁlaments, or “magnetic ropes” and they can be found far from the source region. A projection of
the current-induced magnetic ﬁelds is shown above the graph

3.10.3 Polarization Forces
In the presence of an axial ﬁeld B0, the electrons gyrate in a counter clockwise dir-
ection while the ions gyrate in a clockwise direction. The relationship between the
ion and electron gyroradii is rLi = (mi/me)rLe ≫rLe. In addition to the gyration,
the charged particles experience a polarizing force caused by the net motion of the
plasma ﬁlaments across the guide ﬁeld B0. The net motion derives from Eq. (3.49)
which causes a v × B force, primarily in the ±y-directions in adjacent ﬁlaments
as shown in Fig. 3.14a. As a result, the electrons in columns 2 and 1 are acceler-
ated in the ±y-directions, respectively. This leaves a net excess of the heavier ions
in the original ﬁlament positions, and thereby produces, via Eq.(1.3), an electric
ﬁeld which opposes a further diffusion of electrons. The electrons can separate from
the ions about a Debye length λD =

ε0kT/nee2 before they are restrained by the
ions. The ions then follow the electrons in a process known as ambipolar diffusion
(Rose and Clark 1961). It is evident that the dimensions of the plasma be much
larger than the Debye length for ambipolar diffusion to take place. Figure 3.14b de-
picts the displacement of the currents in the ﬁlaments (because of excess of axial

current-conducting electrons at the ±y surfaces) caused by the inward motion of the
ﬁlaments across B0. The net result of the juxtapositioned currents Iz is a clockwise
torque on the plasma ﬁlaments (Fig. 3.14c).
3.10.4 Magnetic Energy Distribution and Magnetic Isobars
The two parallel axial currents produce the magnetic energy isobars (through
Eq. (1.2)) shown in the time sequence of Fig. 3.15. At T = 9, the contours of B2
are very nearly symmetric about each ﬁlament. Since the currents increase with
time (because of the constant ﬁeld Ez), the B2 isobars move out from each ﬁlament
until a linear superposition of isobars produce a magnetic minimum (“sump”) or
core between the two ﬁlaments (Figs. 3.15 and 3.16). The core has the shape of an
ellipse. The effect of the net inward motion is already seen at timestep 16 with the
juxtapositioning of the B2 isobaric peaks associated with the axial currents. In addi-
tion to the magnetic peaks and core, two narrow magnetic channels form on either
side of the core (Fig. 3.17). At T = 255, the ﬁeld strength squared in the vicinity of

3.10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Interacting Currents
115
the core is B2 = 0.33. The ﬁeld induced pressure is
pB = (2μ0)−1 B2
(3.51)
At time T = 255, a channel exists only on the right-hand-side of Fig. 3.17 with
length 9Δ′ and width 0.5Δ′–2.0Δ′ (The channel alternates from right to left with
the passage of time (Peratt 1986a). The velocity of the isobars toward the core is,
approximately, 0.032 cells per timestep, or
vcomp = 0.032Δ′/dt′
(3.52)
Because of the inward traveling isobars, plasma external to the two conducting
currents is swept into both the channel and the core. Part of this external plasma der-
ives from unpinched plasma which conducts the current before the Bennett relation
equation (1.9) is established.
The phenomena described in the simulation is observed in the laboratory.
Figure 3.18 shows laser Schlieren photographs taken at two different times of
two interacting Z pinches. The Z pinches were created by stringing two 2 cm long
wires between an anode and cathode of a pulsed power generator (Fig. 2.9), which
then exploded into plasma pinches with the conduction of 250 kA current. Fig-
ure 3.18a (t = 40 ns) shows that the Bennett relation has been established and the
conducting paths are conﬁned to circular (but ﬁlamentary) cross-sections. At time
t = 60 ns, the second frame shows that, in addition to the plasma ﬂowing off the
ﬁlaments, plasma external to the pinches has been compressed into the central
core and also into a channel on the right-hand-side of the core. For the parameters
of this experiment, (10 cm/ms). Figure 3.18b shows the time evolution (of wire
midsections) as they explode into Z pinched plasmas. Each ﬁlament undergoes
about a dozen pinch oscillations the ﬁrst 40 ns (Felber and Peratt 1980), followed
by the appearance of inward “jets” of plasma toward the core. The jets of plasma
coalesce in the core at about 80 ns. However, with regard to radiation in the axial
direction: This continues to come from the intense electron currents in two hot spots
at the outer locations. This phase is followed by the rotation of the ﬁlaments into a
spiral structure. A half-rotation is observed to take about 100 ns, corresponding to a
rotation velocity of about 15 km/s.
The radiation burst is an extremely transient phenomena, lasting for only about
5 ns. This appears to be correlated with the constriction of the single Z pinches to
very small diameters, but is intense only when two Z pinches are present.
3.10.5 Net Motion
The long term motion between the ﬁlaments is nonlinear and involves a reconﬁg-
uration of their cylindrical cross-sections. This motion is shown in Fig. 3.19 for
simulation time up to T = 1,700. As shown, the initially circular cross-sections are
deformed into ovals that then take on a “jelly-bean-like” proﬁle prior to forming

to energy maxima while the central ellipse is an energy minimum. “Hot spots” in azimuthal ﬁeld
energy feeding synchrotron radiation are beginning to become noticeable in later time frames

the rotating center.2 Not shown in this sequence is plasma conﬁned in the core, onto
which the outer plasmas converge, which tends to obscure the nuclear region.

in counter-clockwise rotation while the column ions spiral upward in clockwise

plasmoids crossing magnetic ﬁeld lines.

rotation. The current density is j = neqeve + niqivi. A polarization induced charge
separation (Sect. 3.10.3) also occurs in each arm, which, as it thins out, produces a
radial electric ﬁeld across the arm. Because of this ﬁeld, the arm is susceptible to the
diocotron instability (Sect. 1.7.3). This instability appears as a wave motion in each
arm and is barely discernable in the single frame photographs in Fig.3.19 at late
times. However, the instability is readily apparent in the spiral rotational velocity
curve. Figure 3.20 is the rotational velocity curve for the spiral conﬁguration shown
in the last frame of Fig. 3.19.
The velocity essentially consists of a linearly increasing component due to
a central body undergoing rigid rotation, with two “ﬂat” components on either
side of r = 0 due to the trailing arms. The diocotron instability modulates the

plasma ﬁlaments (Z pinches) at times 40 and 60 ns, respectively (end view). The pinches are pro-
duced by exploding two parallel, 15 mm diameter, stainless steel wires with 250 kA of current. The
two space frames show that plasma from the right-hand side ﬁlament has been channeled towards
the central core, by the magnetic ﬁeld isobars, at a velocity of about 100 km/s. The process is
slightly asymmetrical: plasma from the right-hand side ﬁlament has reached and ﬁlled the core at
time 60 ns, whereas the plasma from the left-hand side ﬁlament has not yet started to move inward.
(b) Streak camera photograph showing time evolution of interacting Z pinches conducting 667 kA

regions are recorded: a radiation burst lasting about 5 ns, a “jet” region lasting about 50 ns, where
plasma from the exploded wires is channeled inwards (as well as change in the circular cross sec-
tions (Fig. 3.19)) and then, a spiral region, where the ﬁlaments rotate about each other. Reference
is made to Fig. 1.15 for a similar radiation pattern in astrophysical plasma
“ﬂat” components at the strong-magnetic-ﬁeld, low-density instability wavelength
equation (1.16).
3.10.6 “Doubleness” in Current-Conducting Plasmas
The r−1 dependency of the Biot-Savart force law between current-conducting
ﬁlaments leads to a curious phenomena: a pairing of ﬁlaments (cf. Sect. 2.6). This
pairing leads directly to a “twoness” or “doubleness” when many ﬁlaments are
present in plasmas in which the magnetic ﬁeld plays a major role. As an example,

act strongly to form a spiral while the third ﬁlament remains relatively quiescent.

is given by Bernard et al. (1975) and Bostick (1986).
3.11 Magnetic Fields in Cosmic Dimensioned Plasma
3.11.1 Measurement of Galactic Magnetic Fields
Interstellar magnetic ﬁelds in spiral galaxies can be observed indirectly in the op-
tical and radio range. In recent years observations of the linearly polarized radio
continuum emission led to a signiﬁcant improvement of the data. Extensive reviews
of the observational methods have been published (Heiles 1976; Spoelstra 1977;
Verschurr 1979; Sofue et al. 1986) and the results reviewed by Wielebinski (1989).
The methods used to measure magnetic ﬁelds in galaxies include the following:
1. Optical Polarization. Elongated paramagnetic dust particles become oriented
perpendicularto the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld lines by the effect of paramagnetic
relaxation, ﬁrst discussed by Davis and Greenstein (1951). Extensive observa-
tions of several thousand stars revealed regular features of the magnetic ﬁeld
in our Galaxy with the distance range of the observed stars. The ﬁeld strength
and the degree of uniformity of the ﬁeld, however, can only be determined with
limited accuracy because too little is known about the size, shape, temperature,
and magnetic properties of interstellar grains.
2. Zeeman Splitting of Radio Lines. Spectral lines are split up when the emitting
atoms enter a magnetic ﬁeld. The amount of splitting in a longitudinal ﬁeld is

123
2.8 Hz/mG for the neutral hydrogen (HI) and 3.3 Hz/mG for the OH radio line
and has been observed in several Galactic clouds (Verschurr 1979).
3. Faraday Rotation of Polarized Radio Emission. Continuous radio emission
is observed from interstellar plasma clouds (HII regions) which radiate by
interaction of thermal particles (free-free emission), and/or by synchrotron emis-
sion. Thermal radio emission is unpolarized, and synchrotron radiation is partly
polarized.
The plane of polarization of a linearly polarized radio wave is rotated when
the wave passes through a magnetized plasma according to Eq. (B.14). For an
electron plasma, positive (counterclockwise) Faraday rotation occurs if the mag-
netic ﬁeld is directed towards the observer; negative (clockwise) Faraday rotation
occurs if the ﬁeld points away from the observer. For a positron plasma, the
situation is reversed. From Eq. (B.14), the rotation angle ξ increases with the
integral of neB|| over the line of sight (where B|| is the magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nent along the line of sight) and with λ 2 (λ = wavelength of observation). The
quantity Δξ/λ 2 is called the “rotation measure” (RM).
An accurate determination of RM requires observations at (at least) three
wavelengths because the observed direction of the polarization vectors is
ambiguous by ±n180◦.
4. Synchrotron Radiation. The average ﬁeld strength Bperp can be estimated
from the average synchrotron intensity equation (6.94) since the intensity
depends on the ﬁeld strength and the density of cosmic-ray electrons in the
relevant energy range. However, to make this estimation, an equipartition be-
tween the energy densities or pressure equilibrium of the magnetic ﬁeld and
cosmic rays is assumed. Since the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and the local
star formation rate are related quantities, equipartition is not valid, and the ﬁeld
strengths estimated are too small (Beck 1990).
3.11.2 Milky Way Galaxy
In the solar neighborhood, the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld has been determined
with rather high accuracy, applying methods in both the optical and the radio range.
From the rotation and dispersion measures of 38 pulsars within 2 kpc from the sun,
the strength of the uniform ﬁeld has been found to be
B||
 = 2.2±0.4μG. The total
synchrotron radiation radio emission in the anticenter direction yields an effective
total ﬁeld strength of 6±1μG. A uniform ﬁeld of 3μG plus a turbulent ﬁeld of a sim-
ilar strength yields a total ﬁeld strength of ∼4 μG which is sufﬁcient to account for
the minimum Galactic radio emission between spiral arms, using the local cosmic-
ray electron density (Phillips et al. 1981). The maximum effective ﬁeld in spiral
arms has to be stronger; its strength depends on the clumpiness of the ﬁeld along
the line of sight. If magnetized plasma clouds occupy 5 % of the line of sight, the
mean strength in the plasma clouds must be ∼45 μG.

124
3 Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Plasma
The observations are roughly consistent with this value. Zeeman splitting of HI
lines revealed ﬁeld strengths up to 50 ± 15μG in Orion A (Harnet 1984). The OH
lines allow measurements with higher accuracy. In a molecular cloud in NGC 2024
the ﬁeld strength is B|| = −38 ± 1μG (Crutcher and Kaz´es 1983). Faraday rotation
of radio waves from background sources reveal ﬁeld strengths of a few microgauss
in HII regions and up to 50μG in molecular clouds (Heiles et al. 1981).
Measurements of the Zeeman effect have now been made in HI clouds (Verschurr
1987), OH molecular clouds (Crutcher et al. 1987), and in H2O masers (Fiebig and
G¨usten 1988). These data indicate that the magnetic ﬁelds in the Galaxy are along
the local spiral arm (i.e., azimuthal). For example, Vall´ee (1988) shows that any
deviations of pitch angle of the ﬁeld from the spiral arm are slight, possibly less than
6◦(Fig. 3.22). Val´ee also deduces a ﬁeld reversal in the Sagittarius arm. This could
support claims that the galactic magnetic ﬁeld is bisymmetric (Sofue and Fujimoto
1983).
High resolution radio continuum VLA observations at 6 and 20 cm wavelengths
(Yusef-Zadeh et al. 1984) reveal numerous plasma ﬁlaments in the inner 60 pc
(3 × 1018 m or 317 light years) of the Galaxy, ∼0.3 pc in diameter by 10–60pc
in length (Fig. 1.14). The ﬁlaments are highly polarized, indicating a synchrotron
origin for the radio emission. The ﬁlaments are aligned roughly perpendicular to
the galactic plane so that the magnetic ﬁeld is poloidal in a cylindrically force-free
conﬁguration. The polarization structure near the Galactic center has been recorded
with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope by Seiradakis et al. (1985) at 6.3 cm (4.75 GHz)
and 2.8 cm (10.7 GHz). Figure 3.23 shows a radiograph of the intensity of polarized
emission at 10.7 GHz and depicts two radio lobes on either side of a core. Seiradakis
et al. note that the “core-lobe” structure is the same as that of a classical double radio
source. Seiradakis’s results have been substantiated by 9 mm (33 GHz) observations
of Reich (1988), who ﬁnds that in the galactic center the magnetic ﬁeld runs exactly
perpendicular to the galactic plane (Wielebinski 1989). The strength of the ﬁeld is
1 mG. An azimuthal (toroidal)/poloidal galactic ﬁeld of about 1 mG strength was
observed earlier in plasma simulations of spiral galaxies (Peratt 1984).
3.11.3 Spiral Galaxies
During the last decade, radio polarization observations have revealed large-scale
magnetic ﬁelds in spiral galaxies (Peratt 1990). For example, the Effelsberg radio
telescope has collected polarization data from about a dozen spiral galaxies at 6–
49 cm wavelengths (Beck 1990). Rotation measures show two different large-scale
structures of the interstellar ﬁelds: Axisymmetric-spiral and bisymmetric-spiral pat-
terns (Krause et al. 1989). Figure 3.24 illustrates two cases of bisymmetric spiral
structure in the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld of spiral galaxies (Harnet et al. 1989;
Horellou et al. 1990).
The orientation of the ﬁeld lines is mostly along the optical spiral arms. How-
ever, the uniform ﬁeld is often strongest outside the optical spiral arms. In IC 342

Fig. 3.22 Model of the magnetic ﬁeld in our Galaxy (Courtesy of R. Beck)
two ﬁlamentary structures are visible in the map of polarized intensity (Fig. 3.25).
Their degree of polarization of ∼30 % indicates a high degree of uniformity of
the magnetic ﬁeld on the scale of the resolution (∼700pc). These ﬁlaments extend
over a length of ∼30 kpc and hence are the most prominent magnetic-ﬁeld features
detected in normal spiral galaxies so far.
A detailed analysis of the rotation measure distribution in a spiral arm southwest
of the center of the Andromeda galaxy M31 (Beck 1990) shows that the magnetic
ﬁeld and a huge HI cloud complex are anchored together. The magnetic ﬁeld then
inﬂates out of the plane outside the cloud. The tendency for the magnetic ﬁeld to
follow the HI distribution has been noted in several recent observations. Circum-
stantial evidence has accumulated which suggests that there is a close connection
between rings of CO and Hα seen rotating in some galaxies and the magnetic ﬁelds

126

in the nuclear regions. This is particularly apparent in observations of spiral galaxies
viewed edge-on. This scenario has also been invoked for our Galaxy (Wielebinski
1989).
Neutral hydrogen is detected from galaxies via the van de Hulst radio-emission
line at 21.11 cm (1.420 GHz), which arises from the transition between the
hyperﬁne-structure sublevels of the ground state of a hydrogen atom (Kaplan
and Pikelner 1970). This is the sole procedure for the direct observation of neutral
hydrogen in galaxies. High-resolution observation of neutral hydrogen in irregular
and spiral galaxies usually reveal extended HI distributions. Contour maps of the
HI typically show a relative lack of HI in the cores of spiral galaxies but high HI
content in the surrounding region, usually in the shape of a “horseshoe” (Rogstad
et al. 1974; Bosma et al. 1977a,b; Bosma 1981a,b; Hummel and Bosma 1982; Van
Woerden et al. 1983). This region is not uniform but may have two or more peaks in
neutral hydrogen content. Figure 3.26 shows several examples of HI distributions
in spiral galaxies.

polarized ﬂux density of components A, B and C is 690, 310, and 140 mJy, respectively (Courtesy

Example 3.2. Bisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld distribution in a simulated spiral
galaxy. For the simulated galaxy we choose Δ′ = 1.66×1020 m, dt′ = 5.87×1011 s,
a mass per unit length of 1041 kg/1021 m (1044 g/35 kpc), and Bφ = 2.5×10−8 T (cf.,
Example 6.3, Sect. 6.6.2). Figure 3.27 shows the plasma spiral formed in this sim-
ulation overlayed on its magnetic ﬁeld line (squared) isobars. The diameter of the
spiral is about 50 kpc with a mass of 1041 kg, i.e., a size and mass of that observed
from spiral galaxies. A direct comparison to observations is made by superimposing

the HI distribution in NGC 4151 on its optical photograph (Fig. 3.27b). The observa-
tion shows two peaks in neutral hydrogen surrounding a void. The void is orientated
towards one of the arms. The simulation allows the two peaks to be traced back
to their origin. Both are found to be the remnants of the originally extended com-
ponents (i.e., cross-sections of the original Birkeland ﬁlaments). As discussed in
Sect. 4.6.3, the accumulation and neutralization of hydrogenic plasma is expected
in strong magnetic ﬁeld regions. The hydrogen deﬁcient center is the remnant of
an elliptical galaxy formed midway between the ﬁlaments, in the magnetic null
(Sect. 3.11.4).

3.11.4 Rotational Velocities of Spiral Galaxies
Rotational velocities of spiral galaxies are obtained by measuring the doppler shift
of the Hα line emitted by neutral hydrogen in the spiral arms. If the galaxy is canted
toward earth, the emission-line in the arm moving away from earth is red-shifted
while the line in the arm moving towards earth is blue-shifted. Figure 3.28 shows
six radial velocity versus radius curves typical of spiral galaxies. These data show
(1) a nearly linear solid-body rotation for the galaxy center (the ﬁrst few arcminutes
from center), (2) a nearly radially independent velocity proﬁle in the spiral arms,
and (3) distinct structure in the spiral arms that appears on the so-called ﬂat portion
of the velocity curve (beyond the ﬁrst few arcminutes or, equivalently, the ﬁrst few
kiloparsecs).
Example 3.3. Rotational velocity of a simulated spiral galaxy. Using the scaling
of Example 3.2, the rotational velocity given in Fig. 3.30 can be converted to physi-
cal units. The average velocity for the ﬂat portion of the curve is v = 0.0213Δ′/dt′,
or, in time-compressed units, 6×103 km/s. Applying the mass correction factor 10.7
(Sect. 10.6.3) and the electric ﬁeld correction factor 2.5,3 the rotational velocity
is 226 km/s. This curve is replotted in the last frame of Fig. 3.28 and is in good
agreement with the observations. Concomitant with the lengthening of the arms is a
thinning of the arms as shown in Fig. 3.19. As discussed in Sect. 3.10.5, a diocotron
instability is produced. This instability shows up in both the cross-sectional views
of the spiral arms and in the velocity proﬁle, where a distinct vortex “saw-tooth”

rected for Faraday rotation as derived from data at 6.3 and 20 cm. The vectors have arbitrary lengths
and are superimposed onto a contour map of the linearly polarized intensity at 20 cm (Courtesy of
R. Beck 1986)
3 To reduce the computation time to spiral formation, the acceleration ﬁeld Ez was increased 2.5
times, from 12 to 30 mV/m. A ﬁeld strength ∼1–10 mV/m is consistent with that associated with
double layers in the near-earth plasma (Sect. 4.4). It should be noted that over the axial extent of a
spiral galaxy, ∼10 kpc, a millivolt per meter ﬁeld strength corresponds to a potential of 3×1017 V
(Sect. 5.6.4).

pattern is measured. Good examples of this instability are found in the Sc-type
galaxies M101, NGC 253, and NGC 2998 (Arp 1986). Figure 3.29, NGC 3646, is
an example of a very large diocotron instability, similar to that observed in auroras,
in the spiral arms.

3.11.5 Elliptical Galaxies
Elliptical (E) galaxies, as distinct from peculiars, irregulars, and spirals, are char-
acterized by a very smooth texture, a bright nucleus, and a tenuous outer enve-
lope of large extent (sensitive photographic plates show that the visible envelope
may be 20 times the diameter of the nucleus, Fig. 3.30). Ellipticals are most often
found midway between the extended radio components of double radio galaxies
and radioquasars. Figure 3.31 is an example of this geometry. Like S0 galaxies

catalogue, while the outer ellipse spans as much as 70 arcmin. The horizontal extent of the image
frame is 500 arcmin. Note that the inner isophotes have vertical major axes, but the outer isophotes
show noticeable clockwise twisting
(galaxies with little or no evidence of star-forming activity) E galaxies are found
most frequently in regions characterized by high galaxy density (i.e., areas most
susceptible to interactions).

The resolution of the magnetic energy density is insufﬁcient to resolve the mag-
netic ﬁeld structure in the simulation spiral arms. (galaxies with little or no evidence
of star-forming activity) E galaxies are found most frequently in regions character-
ized by high galaxy density (i.e., areas most susceptible to interactions).

134
3 Biot-Savart Law in Cosmic Plasma
Diffuse elliptical galaxies are also found midway between the synchrotron emit-
ting galactic simulation ﬁlaments. These galaxies are characterized by a twisting of
their outer isophotes. Elliptical galaxies have weak or no magnetic ﬁelds.
Example 3.4. Simulated elliptical galaxy. Figures 3.15 and 3.17 depict the
elliptical core formed in a plasma galaxy simulation. In physical units, the bot-
tom frame of Fig. 3.16 corresponds to an elapsed time of 20 Myr from the start
of the ﬁlament interaction. At this time, the ﬁeld strength squared in the vicin-
ity of the core (approximately midway up the ﬁgure) is Bφ = 0.592 × 10−8 T.
The ﬁeld induced pressure deﬁning the boundary of the core at this time is
pB = (2μ0)−1 B2
φ = 1.4 × 1011 Pa (1.4 × 10−10 dyn/cm2). This isobar extends
some 50 kpc and can balance the thermokinetic pressure of a 104 m−3 (10−2 cm−3)
6 keV plasma compressed into the core. The magnetic ﬁeld is null at the core center.
As is the case with elliptical galaxies, the simulated elliptical plasma galaxy shows
only a slight twist of rotation (Fig. 3.17), caused by the start of a clockwise rotation
of ﬁlaments beginning a Biot-Savart force law interaction (Sect. 3.10.3).
3.11.6 Intergalactic Magnetic Fields
A large-scale intercluster magnetic ﬁeld with an estimated strength of 0.3–0.6μG
located between the Coma cluster of galaxies and the Abell 1367 cluster was dis-
covered in 1989 (Kim et al. 1989) (Sect. 2.6.6).

Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma
Electric ﬁelds play a crucial role in cosmic plasmas. Electric ﬁelds can accelerate
charged particles to high energies and cause currents to ﬂow, generate and “un-
freeze” magnetic ﬁelds in plasmas, cause plasma to pinch into ﬁlaments, separate
chemical elements, and initiate the collapse of plasma to the condensate and neutral
state of matter.
Until fairly recent times, electric ﬁelds were thought impossible, ﬁrst in
space (because the conductivity σ was thought to be zero), and then in cos-
mic plasma (because the conductivity σ was thought to be inﬁnite and the plasma
thought to be uniform). For these reasons, other mechanisms were sought to explain
the existence of highly-relativistic charged particles which, in terrestrial laborato-
ries, are produced only by accelerators with high potential gradients (i.e., electric
ﬁelds).
The discovery of magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned (“parallel”) electric ﬁelds in space above
the aurora has profoundly changed our concepts of particle energization and plasma
dynamics in the magnetosphere F¨althammar. It may also have far-reaching implica-
tions for the understanding of other space and astrophysical plasmas. The parallel
electric ﬁeld itself is hard to measure directly, but concurrent evidence of its exis-
tence has come from measured particle distributions–electrons as well as ions–both
outside and inside the regions of parallel electric ﬁelds. Thus the existence of par-
allel electric ﬁelds with voltages of several kilovolts is now beyond doubt, but their
distribution in space is still incompletely known.
Section 4.1 brieﬂy mentions how electric ﬁelds occur. The methods of measuring
electric ﬁelds are discussed (Sect. 4.2), followed by the mechanisms that lead to par-
allel electric ﬁelds in the magnetosphere (Sect. 4.3). A review of the data obtained
from satellite and rocket measurements is then presented in Sect. 4.4. The fruit
of these efforts is knowledge that is fundamental to our understanding of plasma-
related phenomena in the rest of the universe, which will forever lie beyond the reach
of in situ measurement. Sections 4.5–4.6 start the application of this knowledge to
these regions of the universe.

4 Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma
4.1 Electric Fields
Maxwell-Hertz-Heaviside’s equations (1.1) and (1.3),
∇× E = −∂B
∂t
∇·E = ρ/ε0 = −e(ne −ni)/ε0
tell us that electric ﬁelds derive from either of two mechanisms: time-varying mag-
netic ﬁelds or charge separation. These two equations are deceptively simple and
convey no information about the multitude of mechanisms whereby a time-varying
magnetic ﬁeld arises or charges separate. Two examples of the former are given in
Sects. 3.5.2 and 3.5.3. Charge separation can occur from from plasma instabilities
(Sect. 1.7.3), gyrations in a magnetic ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld and temperature gradi-
ents, diffusion, drifts, and radiation forces. Intense, high-frequency radiation nearly
always produces free charges in dielectrics which lead to potential gradients ∇φ
from which an electric ﬁeld E = −∇φ derives.
In electromagnetism, understanding the physical system under study is incom-
plete without the knowledge of the electric ﬁeld. For this reason, ﬁeld maps of E
are highly sought after in laboratory and space plasmas. However, in contrast to
the relative simple measurement of magnetic ﬁelds, electric ﬁelds are far harder to
measure (Block et al. 1987).
4.2 Measurement of Electric Fields
A wide variety of techniques for measuring electric ﬁelds with strengths ranging
from millivolts per centimeter to megavolts per centimeter have been developed.
In pulsed energy applications, E-dot (or V-dot) probes, resistive dividers, and elec-
trooptic crystals are used. In space plasmas, spherical double probes, radar, electron
beams, and ion detectors ﬁnd employment. The mapping of electric ﬁelds in space
plasma is also possible by following the motions of rocket released ionized barium
clouds, observing the paths that whistler waves take, and from the convection of ions
in space regions (Helliwell 1967). Rydberg states may also be used for the measure-
ment of electric ﬁelds in space and astrophysical plasmas (Garscadden 1986).
V-Dot Detectors. A V-dot detector is the electric ﬁeld analog to the B-dot detector
(Chap. 3). This detector can be as simple as a chopped-off coaxial cable with its
tip exposed to the voltage that is to be measured. A slightly modiﬁed design uses
a coaxial cable with a small metal sphere or a plate attached to increase sensitivity.
The exposed tip can then be inserted through one electrode or conductor into the
medium in which an electric ﬁeld is present. The detector will capacitive couple to
the opposite electrode or conductor, producing a signal proportional to the area of
the detector times the rate of change of the voltage between conductor elements.

4.2 Measurement of Electric Fields

Figure 4.1 illustrates how a V-dot detector is used to measure the ﬁeld component
normal to the probe plate. The current density J consists of two parts: a conduc-
tion current dependent on the ﬁeld E and the conductivity of the medium σ, and a
displacement current that is proportional to the permittivity ε,

Electro-Optic Crystals. The electrically induced birefringence in electrooptic
crystals can be used to measure electric ﬁelds directly. The experimental

input polarizer whose polarization axis is parallel to the crystal’s x-axis. An output

coefﬁcient (10−30 × 10−12 m/V). For a KD*P crystal, φπ is 3.3 kV. The number of
variations measured in Io/Ii gives the ratio φ/φπ, from which the strength of E
aligned along the major axis of the crystal can be obtained. Electrooptic crystals
ﬁnd application in laboratory regions where high electric ﬁeld strengths exist. For
example, a 10 kV/m ﬁeld strength is required to produce ∼10−3 variation in Io/Ii.
Spherical Double Probes. Spherical double probes often ﬁnd application in mea-
suring electric ﬁelds in space, where ﬁeld strengths may be of the order of a millivolt
per meter. A spherical double probe consists of two spherical sensors mounted at the
ends of wire booms that spin with the satellite as shown in Fig. 4.3. The potential
Fig. 4.2 Electrooptic-crystal electric ﬁeld detector
difference is measured between the sensors that are typically spaced tens of meters
apart. For example, ISEE-1 utilized a 73.5 m probe-to-probe boom length while the
GEOS probe-to-probe separation was 42 m (Fig. 4.4).
The spherical sensors, each several centimeters in diameter, are constructed of
vitreous carbon to ensure uniform work function and photo-emission properties.
Unlike magnetic ﬁeld sensors, probe biasing is necessary to obtain a balance be-
tween currents from escaping photo-electrons along the boom with currents from

4.2 Measurement of Electric Fields

impinging ambient electrons. Often electron guns are necessary for controlling the
satellite potential in order to achieve a satisfactory balance.
In the presence of an electric ﬁeld, the resulting spin modulation signal between
the probes will provide the direction and magnitude of the spin averaged, spin plane
component of the electric ﬁeld. The full electric ﬁeld vector E can be constructed
from the measured data under conditions (F¨althammar et al. 1987).
Ion Detectors. An ion detector in a uniform plasma can measure the bulk velocity
components v|| or v⊥, parallel and perpendicular to B, respectively. In the hydro-
magnetic approximation the gyrocenter drift is uE = E × B/B2, and in a uniform
plasma it is uE = v. This allows checking of electric ﬁeld double probe measure-
ments against a plasma experiment (e.g., in the solar wind where uE = v⊥is the
solar wind velocity component perpendicular to the instantaneous magnetic ﬁeld
vector B).

arrangement. On GEOS-2 the cable braid (100 cm) between probe inner tip and plug could be con-
trolled at negative potentials of a few volts. On ISEE-1 the whole wire boom outer braid potential
could be controlled
Electron Beams. Electron beams emitted from an electron gun may also be used to
measure the electric ﬁeld. The electrons emitted perpendicular to the local magnetic
ﬁeld B gyrate around the ﬁeld and return to their point of origin, provided no other
external forces act on them. The actual beam has dispersion causing the electrons
to spread in the plane perpendicular to B. Their orbits average after each revolution
at the point of origin, which acts as a focal point for detection. When an electric
ﬁeld that is perpendicular to B is present the electrons undergo a drift motion which
results in a shift of the focal point from the origin. This process is identical to the
E ×B drift of electrons in a magnetron or along a cathode that is magnetically insu-
lated (Fig. 4.5). The displacement perpendicular to the beam s amounts to
s = v⊥tH =
 2π
e/m
 E cosωt
B2
(4.9)
where v⊥is the drift velocity of the electrons perpendicular to the beam, tH is the
gyrotime, and ωt is the momentary angle between E and the direction of the beam.
Thus measurement of s and B allows the determination of E through Eq. (4.9).
As an example, for a satellite in stationary orbit about the earth (34,000km),
the magnetic ﬁeld B ∼100 γ (100 nT) so that a measured 3 m displacement at the
satellite would yield E ∼1 mV/m. The gyroradius is about 1 km, so that the electrons
spend most of their ﬂight time away from the satellite and its disturbed surroundings.

4.3.1 Collisionless Thermoelectric Effect
The average force that a charge carrier experiences from a turbulent time-varying
wave ﬁeld will be different for particles of different energy. In a collision-dominated
plasma the friction force decreases rapidly with energy. This is the ordinary ther-
moelectric effect, which is capable of supporting a dc electric potential between
plasmas of different temperatures without requiring a net electric current. In the clas-
sical case we can write the magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned component of the electric ﬁeld

4.3.2 Magnetic Mirror Effect
Parallel electric ﬁelds supported by the magnetic-mirror force were proposed by
Alfv´en and F¨althammar (1963) with application to magnetically trapped particles
in the absence of net currents. Subsequently, the existence of this mechanism in
laboratory plasmas was veriﬁed by Geller et al. (1974).
In the case of currents ﬂowing out of the ionosphere, the effect of the magnetic-
mirror force becomes particularly pronounced, because the downward ﬂow of
current-carrying electrons is inhibited except for those in the loss cone (Fig. 4.6).
To outline the basic physical characteristics of mirror-supported parallel ﬁelds
due to upward Birkeland currents, we note that the electron current density j|| at
ionospheric altitude is related to the total ﬁeld-aligned potential drop φ|| by the rela-
tion (Knight 1973; Lemaire and Scherer 1974)

(4.11)
where T and n are the electron temperature and density of the magnetospheric
source plasma, Bi is the ionospheric magnetic ﬁeld strength, and Bφ|| is the magnetic
ﬁeld strength at the top of the potential variation along ﬁeld lines. This result will
apply provided the electron loss cone in the source plasma is always replenished,
otherwise the current can be choked to arbitrarily low values, approaching the ide-
alized case described by Alfv´en and F¨althammar. Lemaire and Scherer (1983) have
extended Eq. (4.11) to account for both cold and warm electrons as well as ions.
Among the features of Eq. (4.11) is a wide range of voltages for which there is a
linear relationship between voltage and current density. It is to be noted that current
densities commonly observed above the auroras require potential drops of several
kilovolts. Comparisons of the energy ﬂux derived for magnetic-mirror-supported
parallel ﬁelds to the measured energy ﬂux from rocket ﬂights are in excellent
agreement (Lundin and Sandahl 1978).
4.3.3 Electrostatic Shocks
Electrostatic shocks are nonlinear solutions of the coupled time-independent
Poisson-Vlasov equations (Eqs. (1.3) and (2.1), in the absence of collisions). They
are characterized by an electrostatic potential jump supported by space charges of
electrons and ions in the shock region.
Electrostatic shocks in the magnetosphere are limited regions of strong (several
hundred mV/m) transverse electric ﬁelds (Fig. 4.7).
In earth’s magnetosphere electrostatic shocks are reasonably uniformly
distributed in local time, with a slight preference for the cusp, and scarcity in
the post-midnight (0–6 h) region. Electrostatic shocks have been seen as far out as
about 7 Re. Large shocks occur preferentially above 5,000 km and in the 16–22 h

local-time region. However, parallel electric ﬁelds related to electrostatic shocks
probably extend down below 1,100km (Mozer et al. 1980). Upward pointing paral-
lel electric ﬁelds of the order of 100 mV/m and extent of 2 km have been measured
at an altitude of 7,950 km.
4.3.4 Electric Double Layers
The electric double layer is a thin (tens of Debye lengths) space-charge struc-
ture sometimes observed in laboratory experiments of current-carrying plasmas.
Between the two sheaths of equal but opposite charges that constitute the double
layer there is a strong electric ﬁeld, but not in the plasma outside it.

148
4 Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma
The characteristics of the classical double layer are such that for space plasmas
electric ﬁeld strengths as large as 1 V/m are possible. However, this ﬁeld should have
a very narrow altitude range of the order of 100 m, and should therefore be very hard
to detect. Instead of a single strong double layer, satellite measurements and numer-
ical simulations reveal the existence of numerous weak double layers, whose total
contribution can lead to signiﬁcant energy gains by the accelerated particles. For
example, S3-3 and Viking satellite data indicate that ﬁeld-aligned potential drops
are made up of hundreds or thousands of weak double layers.
Although both wave and dc electric ﬁelds can accelerate particles, only a dc ﬁeld,
such as that found in double layers, can accelerate electrons and ions in the opposite
directions to about the same energy. Because this mechanism is observed in space,
laboratory, and simulation plasmas, in association with strong electric ﬁelds, the
topic of double layers is covered in detail in Chap. 5.
4.4 Magnetospheric Electric Fields
4.4.1 The Plasmasphere
The plasmasphere is populated by a collision-dominated plasma for which the
generalized Ohm’s law (Sect. 2.4.1) can be expected to hold. It is therefore, electro-
dynamically, the least complicated part of the magnetosphere (Lyons and Williams
1984). At least in the inner parts of this region one would expect a corotational
electric ﬁeld simply mapped from the corresponding areas of the ionosphere. The
measurements with GEOS-1 and 2 and ISEE-1 have conﬁrmed this but have also
shown interesting deviations. Thus, the average quiet-time electric ﬁelds largely
agree with what has been expected from Whistler results and theoretical considera-
tions. However, the instantaneous electric ﬁeld is highly variable and shows consid-
erable deviations from simple corotation. An example of the plasmaspheric electric
ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 4.8. Inside 3.3 Earth radii there is a very good agreement with
the expected corotational electric ﬁeld, but further out considerable deviations from
corotation are found.
During disturbed conditions, large deviations from corotation are observed near
the plasmapause (Fig. 4.9). Just inside the dusk side of the plasmapause, electric
ﬁelds many times stronger than the corotational ﬁeld, and oppositely directed, have
been observed with GEOS-2. During a substorm very strong electric ﬁelds were
recorded adjacent to and just outside the plasmapause. The ﬁeld strength projected
to the ionospheric level exceeded 100 mV/m, and the event was accompanied by
signiﬁcant penetration of the convection electric ﬁeld inside the plasmapause.

4.4 Magnetospheric Electric Fields
149
4.4.2 The Plasmasheet
Unlike a largely homogeneous and steady dawn-to-dusk electric ﬁeld, the actual
electric ﬁeld in the plasmasheet has proved to be extremely variable, not only in
time but also in space. During geomagnetically quiet times the electric ﬁeld is too
weak to be measured with the double probes ﬂown so far (i.e., less than a few tenths
of millivolts per meter). Finite small values (0.1–0.3mV/m) have, however, been
measured with the electron beam technique of the GEOS spacecraft.
During the substorm active phase, the electric ﬁelds are both strong and variable.
As induction electric ﬁelds are important during times of extreme variability, there
does not even exist an electric potential on the global scale. An example of electric
ﬁelds measured in the plasmasheet is given in Fig. 4.10. Field strengths up to several
tens of mV/m have been recorded near the plasmasheet boundary.
Two-point measurements of the electric ﬁeld components taken by GEOS 2 and
ISEE-1 show a time delay between observed pulses (Fig. 4.11). The direction of
propagation was usually toward the earth with a velocity of the order of the average
Alfv´en velocity.
Occasionally, strong electric ﬁelds associated with “electrostatic shocks” were
seen by ISEE. Figure 4.7 illustrates the peak electric ﬁeld recorded versus earth
radii. As shown, these ﬁelds are of the order of a few hundreds of mV/m and extend
from 2.5 to 7.5 Re.

turbed conditions observed by GEOS-1 and ISEE-1 (Courtesy of C.-G. F¨althammar)
4.4.3 The Neutral Sheet
At quiet times, the electric ﬁeld strength in the neutral sheet is typically less than
0.5 mV/m. At active times, the ﬁeld can reach 6 mV/m (Fig. 4.12).

4.4 Magnetospheric Electric Fields

4.4.4 The Magnetotail
Double probe measurements in the central tail lobes have proven unsatisfactory
because of low plasma densities. However, in other regions of the tail, measure-
ments have been possible. Information about the electric ﬁeld have also been drawn
from plasma ﬂow detected through anisotropies in measured particle ﬂuxes. One
result of the latter kind, is the occurrence of velocity ﬁelds with a nonvanishing
vorticity (Fig. 4.13).
4.4.5 The Magnetopause
Electric ﬁelds in the magnetopause are characterized by violent ﬂuctuations with
ﬁeld strengths as high as 10 mV/m. The surprisingly large amplitudes of these ﬂuc-
tuations probably overshadow any dc ﬁelds that were expected from early models of
the magnetopause. Also, the ﬂuctuations are probably important for the penetration
of plasma into the magnetosphere, as suggested by several investigators.
4.4.6 The Auroral Acceleration Region
Probably the most interesting electric ﬁeld observations of all are those made in the
auroral acceleration region (Fig. 4.14). The ﬁrst electric ﬁeld measurements in this
region were made with the S3-3 satellite. It led to two major discoveries: “electro-
static shocks” and multiple electric double layers.
Electrostatic shocks with ﬁeld amplitudes of hundreds of mV/m were measured
by S3-3 in the altitude range up to the S3-3 apogee of 8,000 km. Other measurements
were made by ISEE-1 and by Viking, which extended the measurement of electric
ﬁelds up to 13,527km (F¨althammar et al. 1991). An example of the electrostatic
shock type observed with Viking is shown in Fig. 4.15.

A typical feature of the Viking electric ﬁeld data is the prevalence of extremely
strong and irregular electric ﬁelds above the auroral oval. The occurrence of such
electric ﬁelds is correlated with regions of electron precipitation. The transition from
quiet, several mV/m electric ﬁelds at subauroral latitudes to the hundreds of mV/m
auroral type oval ﬁelds has been found to be very sharp.

4.4.7 Global Distributions of Auroral Electric Fields
In situ measurements in the magnetosphere have, by necessity, a limited time and
space coverage. Measurements are taken along satellite orbits that are traversed at
intervals of more than an hour for low orbits, and many hours for high orbits. How-
ever by combining (1) in situ measurements with (2) remote-sensing information

such as the Viking UV pictures of the whole auroral oval, as well as (3) ground-
based data relevant to these measurements, and (4) a quantitative mathematical
model of the electrodynamics of the auroral ionosphere, rather detailed informa-
tion can be obtained of the “instantaneous” distribution of auroral electric ﬁelds and
currents.
Figure 4.16 shows an example of the “instantaneous” global electric potential in
the ionosphere as calculated from the Marklund-Blomberg model and the electric
ﬁeld measured in situ with Viking and projected down to the ionosphere.1
The instantaneous global electric potential pattern calculated by Marklund and
Blomberg shows, as it should, a general but not detailed agreement with average
patterns calculated for the same geophysical conditions. An example is shown in
Fig. 4.17. The calculated pattern has also been projected to the equatorial plane and
compared to the average plasmapause. The instantaneous demarcation line between
open and closed equipotentials of the instantaneous potential distribution shows, as
it should, a general but not detailed agreement with the average plasmapause.

4.5 Outstanding Questions
The earth’s magnetosphere still poses a number of unsolved problems that involve
electric ﬁelds in a fundamental way. The way in which plasma enters the magne-
tosphere, both from the solar wind and from the ionosphere, is still far from fully
understood. More direct measurements are needed to solve the problem of plasma
entry (Nishida 1988).
The earth’s own ionosphere is an important source of magnetospheric plasma.
The expulsion of ionospheric plasma is the result of complex interactions between
the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. In these interactions, electric ﬁelds,
including magnetic ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁelds, seem to play an important role.
The auroral acceleration region still holds a number of unanswered questions.
They concern, for example, the existence, distribution, and other properties of ﬁeld-
aligned electric ﬁelds, and their role in auroral acceleration. These are questions
that are also relevant to the understanding of cosmical plasmas in general, which are
known to have a remarkable capability of energizing charged particles (F¨althammar
1977, 1978, 1979, 1983, 1988).

4.6 Phenomena Associated with Electric Fields
4.6.1 Surface Discharges
Surface discharges are produced by large electric ﬁelds that develop between the
surface and subsurface layers in dielectric materials as a consequence of energetic
charged-particle deposition. For example, when spacecraft dielectrics are exposed
to bursts of kiloelectronvolt particles during magnetic substorms, the particles pene-
trate a few micrometers to a few millimeters, building up ﬁeld strengths which may
be of the order of hundreds of kilovolts per centimeter. A schematic representation
of this process is shown in Fig. 4.18.
If the material is a conductor or a semiconductor, a conduction current will ﬂow
in response to the charge deposition and will effectively neutralize the ﬁeld. If the
material is an insulator, the space charge will build up at a rate faster than the local
relaxation time, and the associated electric ﬁeld will increase. When the ﬁeld reaches
a critical value that depends on the material, surface smoothness, and porosity, a sur-
face discharge will occur. This is a problem that often occurs in laboratory pulsed-
power and, in fact, is the limiting constraint on how much power can ﬂow in labo-
ratory transmission lines. Figure 4.19 illustrates the “Lichtenberg ﬁgures” recorded

just below the surface of an acrylic transmission line spacer. Voltage breakdown at
dielectric interfaces nearly always results in the formation of these dendrite-type
streamers.2
Surface discharges will also occur on natural dielectrics in the solar system when
these surfaces are exposed to large ﬂuxes of energetic particles. This condition can
be found, for example, where magnetospheric currents interact with the surfaces of
the giant planets and their satellites.
2 For thick acrylic pulse-line spacers, of the order of 10 cm wide, Lichtenberg ﬁgures are three-
dimensional and can extend over the width of the insulator.

dielectric material is exposed to energetic particles. In general, ions do not penetrate signiﬁcantly
below the surface, but electrons can penetrate to depths ranging from a few micrometers to a few
millimeters, depending on their energy and the type of target material. When the electric ﬁeld that
develops between the surface and subsurface layers reaches a critical breakdown value, a surface
discharge will occur
4.6.2 Plasma Gun Arc Discharges
The plasma gun or dense plasma focus is one of the most “physics-rich” devices in
plasma science. Characteristically, it is one of the least understood. The annihilation
of magnetized plasma in a pinch results in the collective acceleration of ions to very
high energies and the prodigious production of neutrons. In the late 1950s and early
1960s this device saw application in explaining the origin of the planets and satel-
lites (Alfv´en 1960; Alfv´en and Wilcox 1962). Today, the dense plasma focus forms
one of the most promising alternatives (to Tokamaks) in magnetic fusion (Gratton
et al. 1990).
The plasma gun or plasma focus (Alfv´en 1958, 1981; Lindberg et al. 1960; Lind-
berg and Jacobsen 1961; Filippov et al. 1962; Alfv´en and F¨althammar 1963; Mather
1971; Bostick et al. 1975) is a plasma discharge consisting of a short but ﬁnite Z
pinch (Sect. 6.6.1) which forms near or at the end of a coaxial plasma discharge.
In the laboratory, the coaxial discharge is formed by switching a charged capacitor
bank between a center electrode and an outer conducting tube electrode (Fig. 4.20).
The discharge is manifested by a current sheath, called a penumbra, that forms be-
tween the inner and outer electrodes when the inner electrode is at a positive poten-
tial (i.e., an anode) and the outer electrode is at ground (i.e., a cathode). The current
sheath is equally-well deﬁned whether the inner electrode is at a positive or negative
potential but ion and neutron production at the focus are observed only when the in-
ner electrode is an anode. Part of the stored magnetic energy in the tube and external
circuit is rapidly converted to plasma energy during the current sheath’s collapse to-

ward the axis. The current ﬂow convergence is largely due to the self-constricting
nature of the current ﬁlament, whereas the heating and compression from the r,z
implosion on the axis are due both to the magnetic forces of the current-carrying

160
4 Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma
plasma ﬁlament and to inertial forces. Partial conversion of the kinetic energy of
the imploding axisymmetric current to internal heat energy may occur during the
implosive phase owing to self-collision.
Development of the plasma current leading to the formation of a plasma focus
at the center electrode terminus can be conveniently subdivided into three main
phases. First is the initial gas breakdown and the formation of a parabolic current
front. Second is the hydromagnetic acceleration of a current sheath toward the open
end. Third is the rapid collapse of the azimuthally symmetric current sheath toward
the axis to form the plasma focus.
Breakdown Phase. The breakdown has a radial, striated light pattern with a def-
inite multiﬁlamentary structure (Fig. 4.21). This structure, except for its obvious
radial striation, appears cylindrically symmetric (Figs. 4.20 and 4.22). As the cur-
rent increases, the terminus of this visible pattern moves radially outward until it
Fig. 4.20 Typical plasma gun apparatus. A capacitor bank is discharged through two coaxial elec-
trodes forming a plasma current sheath between inner and outer electrodes. The j × B force ac-
celerates the sheath outward to the ends of the electrodes where the inner sheath radius is forced
inwards forming a columnar pinch or “focus” on axis. Also depicted on the diagram is the “penum-
bra”, the long-lived state of the current sheath at the muzzle of the plasma gun (Courtesy of W.
H. Bostick)
reaches the outer electrode. The current front motion is best described as an unpinch
or inverse process (i.e., the (j ×B)r body force is exerted outward between the cen-
ter electrode surface and the plasma current sheath). During this inverse phase, the
sheath remains stable because of the stability of the inverse pinch process (the Bθ
lines are convex).
The ﬁlamentary structures within the focus, rather than blending together, form
a ﬁnite number of intense radial spokes (“spider legs”). These spokes appear to

retain their identity throughout the acceleration phase and ﬁnally coalesce or focus
on the axis beyond the end of the center electrode, forming a thin circular annulus
(Fig. 4.21).
Acceleration Phase. The current sheath across the annulus Δr is not planar, but
canted backward from the anode to the cathode owing to the radial dependence
of the magnetic pressure gradient. The total acceleration force j × B acting per-
pendicular to the current boundary leads to radial and axial motion. The (j × B)r
radial component is outward and forces the current sheath to be annular at the outer
electrode. The axial force (j × B)z varies as r−2 across the annulus and leads to
higher sheath velocities near the surface of the center electrode. In the laboratory,
fast image converter photographs distinctly show a parabolic current front. Owing
to the parabolic current boundary, plasma ﬂows centrifugally outward from anode
to cathode along the current boundary as the acceleration continues. Plasma is seen
to progress radially outward and beyond the outer electrode diameter as the current
front accelerates downstream.
The overall time for plasma sheath acceleration to the end of the center electrode
is related to the discharge potential across the annulus and the mass density of the
background gas. For the case in which the current sheath pushes the gas ahead of
the sheath, the sheath velocity is
vs =

E2
μ0ρm0
1/4
(4.12)
where E and ρm0 are the discharge ﬁeld strength and initial mass density, respec-
tively.
Collapse Phase. The third phase encompasses the rapid convergence of the
axisymmetric current sheath to the axis and the conversion of stored magnetic
energy to plasma energy in the focus. The r,z convergence is due to the j × B pinch
force. With this conﬁguration, there is no equilibrium along the axis; hence the
plasma may readily escape axially in either direction. By the very nature of the
convergence, much of the gas that the sheath encounters during collapse is ejected
downstream and lost. The gas trapped in the focus is estimated as ∼10 % of that
originally present.
The pinch effect is perhaps the most efﬁcient way of heating and compressing
a plasma. As the pinch induced implosion velocity of the current boundary imparts
the same velocity to both ions and electrons, and because of the ion-electron mass
difference, most of the energy appears as kinetic energy of the ions. In pinch devices,
the ions are preferentially heated.
Dynamic Behavior of the Current Sheath. The dynamic behavior of the plasma
current sheath can be analyzed using the measured time dependent values of the
voltage φ(t) across the electrodes, the tube current I(t), and the sheath resis-
tance R(t).

4 Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma
Example 4.1 Electric arcs on the Jovian satellite Io. The satellite Io was observed
by the spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 to be covered with volcanoes (Morabite
et al. 1979; Smith et al. 1979; Strom et al. 1979; Strom and Schneider 1982). Nine
active volcanoes were observed during the Voyager 1 encounter, eight of which
were still active during the Voyager 2 ﬂyby 4 months later. Detailed pictures of the
plumes from one of these volcanoes were rather striking in that the plume material
was ejected in a well-deﬁned cone whose geometry showed converging (rather than
diverging) matter at large lateral distances from the vent, and the plume material
was concentrated into striations. Thus, we have a volcanic vent with exit velocities
of about 0.5 km/s, but with the volcanic efﬂuent concentrated into a cone with a half
angle initially less than about 25◦to the vent axis. Furthermore, the material in the
cone tends to concentrate into ﬁlaments that terminate on a narrow, well-deﬁned,
concentric annulus (Strom and Schneider 1982). The possibility that details of the
volcanic discharge are a manifestation of a plasma arc at the volcanic vent were
initially suggested by Gold (1979).
The dominant electric ﬁeld in the Jovian magnetosphere is one that is associated
with the corotational motion of plasma. This is given by E = −(Δω × R) × B =
−Δv × B, where R is the position vector from the center of Jupiter and ω is the
angular velocity vector of Jupiter’s rotation. The electric ﬁeld is directed outwards
where δω = ω′ is the difference between ω and the angular velocity ω′ of Io’s
motion.
Plasma in Jupiter’s magnetosphere injected from Io (the Io plasma torus) ﬂows
past Io with a speed of about 57 km/s. The magnetic ﬁeld from Jupiter at Io is
1,900 nT. The v × B voltage induced across Io (3,630km) is therefore 400 kV, and
approximately 106. A was observed to be ﬂowing out of the satellite (Acuna et al.
1981; Southwood et al. 1980). It would seem plausible that the current would tend to
concentrate in the volcanic plumes, which would give the current easy access to the
highly conducting molten interior of Io. We would suppose that the crust, consisting
of sulfur and frozen sulfur dioxide, would be a relatively poor conductor, thus direct-
ing the current to the volcanic vents. If we assume the available power (∼0.4 TW)
is equally divided between the four largest volcanic plumes, we have ∼1011 W of
continuous power available for each volcanic plasma arc. This is roughly equal to
the kinetic energy ﬂux of material issuing from a volcanic vent. A small fraction of
this power can account for the faint auroral glow reported by Cook et al. (1981).
Figure 4.24 illustrates the basic geometry at hand. Viewed from the north Jovian
and Ionian poles, Jupiter’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld is into the plane of the ﬁgure while
the plasma ﬂow within the torus is counterclockwise toward Io. With this orienta-
tion, the electric ﬁeld is directed from Jupiter to Io. Volcanic activity on Io generally
occurs within an equatorial band of ±30◦latitude.
Figures 4.25 and 4.26 are photographs of the particularly well-developed vol-
canic plume Prometheus (latitude −2.9◦, longitude 153◦) taken at two different as-
pect angles by Voyager 1. The height and width of this plume is 77 and 272 km,
respectively (Strom and Schneider 1982) while the vent velocity of the gaseous ma-
terial ejected is 0.49 km/s. The current ﬂow is outward from Prometheus (i.e., the
vent of Prometheus is an anode). To relate these pictures to the plasma-arc process,

4.6 Phenomena Associated with Electric Fields
165
we must explicitly assume that the ﬁne particulate matter that makes the volcanic
plumes visible is entrained by the plasma. Thus, as the plasma moves to form ﬁla-
ments, we assume that the plasma carries with it the small solid particles.
While an exact calculation of the breakdown ﬁeld associated with a volcanic
arc discharge requires precise knowledge about the region where the breakdown
occurs,3 an estimate can be made in the following way (Peratt and Dessler 1988).
For a sufﬁciently large separation between anode and cathode electrodes, the break-
down ﬁeld strength in air, nitrogen, freon, and sulfur hexaﬂuoride is (Miller 1982),
Ebr = 2.64pF−1 (MV/m)
(4.19)
where p is the pressure of the ambient gas in atmospheres and F represents a ﬁeld
enhancement factor of order unity that depends on the shapes of the anode and
cathode. Applying Eq.(4.19) to SO2, the most common gas on Io, while setting
F = 1 and taking an ambient pressure of the gas near the vapor-liquid transition (the
triple point for SO2 is 0.0163 atmospheres), yields Ebr = 0.044 MV/m (0.4 kV/cm).
This value is to be compared to the breakdown ﬁeld strength for lightning on earth
(0.44 MV/m (4.4 kV/cm)).
Fig. 4.24 The Jupiter-Io system (north pole view). The rotational period of Jupiter is approximately
9 h 50 m. The orbital (synchronous) period of Io is 1.770 days. The relative velocity of the plasma
torus ﬂowing past Io is 57 km/s. Io’s radius of orbit is 4.22×1054 km (Diagram is not to scale)
Substituting E = 0.044MV/m and into Eq. (4.12), we obtain a parabolic sheath
velocity of vs = 0.893 km/s, close to that observed for Prometheus (0.49 km/s). It
is at this velocity that gas and plasma are pushed into Io’s upper atmosphere by
means of the arc discharge mechanism. The volcanos efﬂuent is concentrated into a

morphology (Fig. 4.26) suggests that the location of the electrical discharge may be well below the
surface of Io.

ways. The ﬁrst is the radial striations resulting from the electromagnetic pinch and

tion of the penumbra on a narrow cathode annulus (Figs. 4.22 and 4.26).

4.6 Phenomena Associated with Electric Fields
167
4.6.3 Marklund Convection and Separation of Elements
When an electric ﬁeld is present in a plasma and has a component perpendicular to
a magnetic ﬁeld, radial inward convection of the charged particles is possible. This
situation is depicted in Fig. 4.27. Under the inﬂuence of the E × B force, both the
electrons and ions drift with the velocity
v = (E × B)/B2
(4.20)
so that the plasma as a whole moves radially inward. This mechanism provides
a very efﬁcient convection process for the accumulation of matter from plasma.
The material should form as a ﬁlamentary structure about the twisted magnetic ﬂux
tubes, the lines of which are commonly referred to as “magnetic ropes” because
of their qualitative pattern (Fig. 4.28). Magnetic ropes should tend to coincide with
material ﬁlaments that have a higher density than the surroundings (this is also the
case for the ﬁlaments in the current sheath of the plasma focus). The cosmic mag-
netic ﬂux tubes are not directly observable themselves, but the associated ﬁlaments
of condensed matter can be observed by the radiation they emit and absorb.
When a plasma is only partially ionized, the electromagnetic forces act on the
non-ionized components only indirectly through the viscosity between the ionized
and non-ionized constituents. From Eq. (4.20), the inward drift of matter is at a
velocity |vr| ≈Ez/Bφ. Hence, at a large radial distance r, the rate of accumulation
of matter, per unit length, into a ﬁlament is
dM
dt = 2πrvrρm = (2πr)2 ρm
Ez
μ0Iz
(4.21)
If the electric ﬁeld is antiparallel to the current, the drift is outwards.
Marklund (1979) found a stationary state when the inward convection of ions and
electrons toward the axis of a ﬁlament was matched by recombination and outward
diffusion of the neutralized plasma (Fig. 4.29). The equilibrium density of the ion-
ized component normally has a maximum at the axis. However, because of the fol-
lowing mechanism, hollow cylinders, or modiﬁcations of hollow cylinders of matter,
will form about the ﬂux tubes.
Because of the radiated loss of energy, the ﬁlaments cool and a temperature gra-
dient is associated with the plasma. As the radial transport depends on the ion-
ization potential of the element, elements with the lowest ionization potentials are
brought closest to axis. The most abundant elements of cosmical plasma can be
divided into groups of roughly equal ionization potentials as follows: He(24 eV);
H,O,N(13 eV); C,S(11 eV); and Fe, Si, Mg(8 eV) (Table 1.7). These elements can
be expected to form hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential.
Helium will make up the most widely distributed outer layer; hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen should form the middle layers, while iron, silicon, and magnesium will
make up the inner layers. Interlap between the layers can be expected and, for the
case of galaxies, the metal-to-hydrogen ratio should be maximum near the center
and decrease outwardly. Both the convection process and the luminosity increase
with the ﬁeld Ez.

168
4 Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma
Fig. 4.27 When the pressure is negligible the plasma acquires a drift velocity v such that the
electric ﬁeld in the moving plasma is parallel to B. Therefore, current ﬂows only along the magnetic
lines of force
For the case of a fully ionized hydrogenic plasma, the ions drift inwards until
they reach a radius where the temperature is well below the ionization potential
and the rate of recombination of the hydrogen plasma is considerable. Because of
this “ion pump” action, hydrogenic plasma will be evacuated from the surroundings
and neutral hydrogen will be most heavily deposited in regions of strong magnetic
ﬂux. Examples of this convection for galaxies are given in Sect. 3.11.3. In addition,
Mirabel and Morras (1984) have detected the inﬂow of neutral hydrogen towards
our own galaxy.
4.6.4 Particle Acceleration and Runaway
The equation of motion of an electron in a region of plasma in which there is an
external electric ﬁeld E is (cf. Eq. (C.1))
me ˙v = −eE −νcmev
(4.22)
where νc is the electron-electron collision frequency associated with the so-called
dynamical friction from Coulomb scattering (Rose and Clark 1961), given by

E = e4nevlnΛ

(4.25)
Equation (4.25) is the dual of the sum of a uniform ﬁeld plus the ﬁeld of a point
charge.
To gain some insight into the meaning of Eq.(4.25), consider two electrons, one
with initial velocity v(0) small and the other with initial velocity v(0) large. For the
former, if
v(0) < vcrit =
 e3ne lnΛ
2πε2

1/2
(4.26)
the right-hand side of (4.25) is negative and the electron eventually decelerates to
a stop. For the latter, v(0) > vcrit, and the electron accelerates. Since Eq. (4.23)
decreases with the inverse cube of the velocity, the drag force decreases as the
electron accelerates, causing the electron acceleration to increase still further.

4 Electric Fields in Cosmic Plasma

No recombination, recombination with T = constant, and recombination with a lower central

This phenomenon is known as electron runaway. Electrons with an initial
velocity above the threshold velocity gain speed indeﬁnitely (within the limits
of relativity), so long as the electric ﬁeld is present, and “run away”, while initially
slow electrons come to rest.
To determine what portion of an electron population undergoes runaway, we

so that large ﬁelds E imply low vcrit and a large population of runaway electrons.

4.6 Phenomena Associated with Electric Fields

Example 4.2 Runaway electrons in fusion and cosmic plasmas. Consider a fu-
sion plasma ne = 1020 m−3, E = 10 V/m, and lnΛ = 20. Substituting these values
into Eq. (4.27) shows that electrons with energies above 5 keV will run away. Con-
sider a cosmic plasma ne = 103 m−3, E = 10−6 V/m, and T = 3 keV. For these val-
ues, electrons with energies greater than 0.5 μeV will run away. Thus, electrons in
cosmic plasmas are readily accelerated to high energies in the presence of even very
small electric ﬁelds.
Equation (4.22), and the runaway process, will be modiﬁed if a magnetic induc-
tion B is present. However, if E and B are parallel, the runaway condition is not
altered. In addition, the body of electron population which attracts electrons of less
than runaway speed is eroded by the escape of electrons brought up to critical speed.
If the electric ﬁeld persists long enough, all the electrons will eventually run away
in energy.
4.6.5 Field-Aligned Electric Fields as the Source of Cosmic Rays
Cosmic rays are extraordinarily isotropic on earth, having a degree of anisotropy
of about 0.1 for low energy particles, then decreasing to ±5 × 10−4 for particles
approaching energies of 1020 eV. At one time, it was generally believed that cosmic
rays were born in the shock waves produced by supernovae. However, it is now
realized that the degree of anisotropy that would be produced by such shocks is far
larger than that observed.
Example 4.3 The anisotropy of charged particle ﬂuxes from supernovae pro-
duced shock waves. Consider the number of supernovae in our Galaxy capable
of subtending a cone of cosmic ray ﬂux of solid angle

D/Rgal
2 on earth where
D ∼102−103 pc is the size of the shock accelerating medium and Rga ∼104 pc.
This number is
Nsn = fsnτsn

D/Rgal
2
where the frequency of supernovae events is fsn ∼1/100 years, and the duration
τsn ∼107 years. Thus, 10 ≤Nsn ≤500 and the degree of anisotropy deﬁned by
an ≡(2Nsn)−1/2 is large, 0.03 ≤an ≤0.3.
Colgate (1990) points outs that because of the high anisotropy of any shock wave
acceleration together with the complete lack of any laboratory evidence that shock-
wave/charge particle acceleration actually exists, that ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁelds
are the most plausible mechanism for producing cosmic rays. This mechanism is
addressed in Sect. 5.6.4.

Double Layers in Astrophysics
Double layers were discovered by Irving Langmuir; (who called them “double
sheathes”) in his experiments with low-pressure discharges in the 1920s. Subse-
quently, they were observed by nearly all the pioneers in experimental plasma
physics (Tonks 1931; Sch¨onhuber 1958; Crawford and Freeston 1963; Bab´ıc et al.
1971). The double layer consists of two thin and close regions of opposite charge
excess which give rise to a potential drop, and therefore an electric ﬁeld, across the
layer. H. Alfv´en ﬁrst advocated the existence of double layers in cosmic settings
(1958), but proof of their existence in the earth’s magnetosphere did not come until
potential probes on earth satellites made in situ measurements two decades later.
5.1 General Description of Double Layers
The basic phenomena under study in this chapter is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. Electrons
and ions counterﬂow with velocities ve0 and vi0, respectively, or with a relative drift
velocity V0 = ve0 +vi0. Because of this counterﬂow, an instability or instabilities are
set up within the current. The net result is a reconﬁguration of the current carrying
charges over a narrow region so as to cause a potential drop. Because of the potential
drop a beam of electrons with instantaneous velocity veb is accelerated to the right
while a beam of ions with instantaneous velocity vib is accelerated to the left. The
phenomenon responsible for this behavior is called a double layer.
The classic double layer (DL) (Tonks 1958; Williams 1987; Langmuir 1929)
is therefore an electrostatic structure which can appear within a current carrying
plasma and sustain a signiﬁcant net potential difference. The thickness is of the
Debye length scale and can be very small compared to the dimensions of the region
in which the DL is embedded. Internally the DL is not charge neutral and must
contain at least two layers of opposite net charge (hence the term “double layer”)
associated with an internal electric ﬁeld (Biskamp and Chodura 1971; Carpenter and
Torven 1987).

5 Double Layers in Astrophysics
Fig. 5.1 (Top) Condition for the development of a double layer. (Bottom) A double layer
Four populations of particles are required to produce the space-charge distribu-
tion needed to support the double layer potential. These are (i) the current-carrying
streaming electrons, (ii) the current-carrying streaming ions, (iii) trapped electrons
on the downstream side of the streaming electrons, and (iv) trapped ions on the
downstream side of the streaming ions.
Figure 5.2 is a sketch of the potential proﬁle, the four-particle populations, and
their contributions to the space-chargedistribution to support the double layer poten-
tial. The streaming electrons and ions are present because the ﬁeld-aligned current
is an essential ingredient of a double layer. Due to the acceleration of the stream-
ing particles by the double layer potential, the density of each streaming particle
population decreases on the downstream side. Therefore, trapped particles must be
produced to ensure overall charge neutrality.
Because electrical currents in astrophysical settings are often aligned along mag-
netic ﬁelds, the internal electric ﬁeld has a component parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld.
Thus, the DL is a region where ideal magnetohydrodynamics breaks down. As a
whole the DL has no net charge and the surrounding plasma may be perturbed by
extended presheaths matching the conditions at the edges of the DL to those in the
undisturbed plasma.
A basic property, which is of particular interest for applications to astrophysics,
is that particles traversing the DL are directly accelerated by the net potential differ-
ence, φDL. The DL acts as an electrical load dissipating energy at a rate IφDL (where
I is the total current through the DL), which is transformed to the directed kinetic
energy of accelerated particles. Thus, the DL exhibits inertial resistance. This should
be contrasted with the effect of ohmic or anomalous resistance, which is to trans-
form electrical energy to thermal or random particle motions. Since the DL acts as a
load, there has to be an external source maintaining the potential difference φDL and
driving the current I. In the laboratory this source is usually an electrical power sup-
ply, whereas in space it may be the magnetic energy stored in an extended current
system Eq. (3.36), which responds to a change in current with an inductive voltage.
The material in this chapter is based primarily on the in-depth reviews of Block
(1978), Carlqvist (1982, 1986), Borovosky (1984a), Borovosky and Joyce (1983)
and Raadu (1989).

5.2 The Time-Independent Double Layer
5.2.1 One-Dimensional Model
It is instructional to ﬁrst consider a one-dimensional, time-independent model of a
double layer with a high potential drop (Carlqvist 1986). In this model the layer is
situated between the cathode boundary at x = 0 and the anode boundary at x = d
(Fig. 5.3). The potential is set φ = 0 at x = 0 and φ = φDL at x = d so that the
potential drop across the layer is φDL. Electrons and ions are emitted with zero
velocity from the cathode boundary and anode boundary, respectively. The ions and
electrons inside the double layer are accelerated in opposite directions along the
magnetic ﬁeld by the electric ﬁeld. The ions accelerate towards the cathode while the
electrons accelerate towards the anode. Since the initial velocity of the particles is
zero, conservation of energy dictates the potential energy be balanced by the kinetic
energy so that
Zeϕ′ = mic2 (γi −1)

The potential drop of both the nonrelativistic and relativistic double layers de-
pend on the product jd2. Note also that the relativistic double layer is strongly inﬂu-
enced by the mass-to-charge ratio of the ions. In Fig. 5.4 the double layer potential
φDL has been plotted as a function of jd2 for double layers carrying electrons and
two kinds of ions (H+, F+
e ). Included in the ﬁgure is also a layer which, instead
of ions, carries positively charged dust grains (Appendix C). The mass and charge
chosen for the grains are mg = 10−20 kg and Zge = 102e, respectively, being con-
stant with a radius rg = 1.4×10−8 m, a density of ρmg = 103 kg m−3, and a potential
φg = 104 V of the grains.
5.2.4 Structure of the Double Layer
The charge distributions in the relativistic double layer are illustrated in Fig. 5.5.
The density of the positive charges Zni shows a spike close to the anode surface and
is almost constant in the rest of the double layer. The spike is caused by rapid ion
acceleration away from the anode. A similar variation is found for the electron den-
sity ne near the cathode surface. The negative spike is much thinner than the positive
spike because of the smaller mass of the electrons. In order for charge neutrality to
prevail in the layer as a whole, the almost constant charge level of the electrons must
be slightly larger than that of the ions. The charge distribution in the layer consists,
approximately, of a positive surface charge at the anode surface and a small and uni-
form negative charge density in the rest of the layer. For a constant current density,
the density of the surface charge remains constant and independent of the thickness
of the relativistic layer (Goldsworthy et al. 1986; Jones and Gisler 1986; Peratt and
Jones 1986).
5.2.5 Kinetic Description
Mathematically, double layers are a subset of the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK)
solutions (Bernstein et al. 1957; Ichimaru 1973) of the Poisson-Vlasov equations
for constant-proﬁle electrostatic potential structures, moving at a constant speed
or stationary in a plasma. The BGK solutions include double layers, electrostatic
shocks, ion-acoustic solitons, and nonlinear wave trains of any potential form. In
the moving frame of a constant-proﬁle constant-speed potential structure, the Vlasov
equation (Eq. (2.1) in the absence of collisions) becomes time independent and can
be written as
v∂fs
∂x −qs

∂v = 0

electrons and singly ionized iron ions, and (3) electrons and dust grains of mass mg = 10−20 kg
and positive charge 102e. Notice that the three curves practically coincide in the nonrelativistic
regime but differ signiﬁcantly in the relativistic regime. The diagram also illustrates the maximum
potential drop φDLm (right-hand vertical scale) as a function of the ﬁlamentary current I0 (upper
horizontal scale) for relativistic double layers in a current ﬁlament (Courtesy of P. Carlqvist)
where the subscript denotes the particle species fs is the distribution function, and φ
is the electrostatic potential. Solutions of the time-independent Vlasov equation, fs,
can be any function of the constants of particle motion. In an unmagnetized plasma,
a constant of the motion is the total energy (i.e., the sum of the kinetic and potential
energies). Hence a general solution of Eq.(5.13) can be written as
fs = fs

v2 + 2qsϕ/ms

The number densities of the electrons and ions can be calculated from the distri-
bution function fs. Thus, using Eq. (2.2) in velocity space, Poisson’s equation (1.3)
can be written as (Kan and Akasofu 1989; Akasofu 1988)

where the number densities ne and ni are functions of the electrostatic potential φ,
as can be seen from Eq.(5.14) upon integration over the velocity space. The third
equality is just a further simpliﬁcation in notation. A standard method for solving
the nonlinear differential of the type of Eq.(5.15) is to treat it as an equation of
motion for the ﬁctitious particle in a pseudo potential Ψ, in which “φ” is taken to
be the “coordinate” and “x” is taken to be the “time.” The double layer solution to
Eq. (5.15) exists if Ψ(φ) has the appropriate form as shown in Fig. 5.6. In this case,
the ﬁctitious particle which starts from point A will roll down the potential well Ψ
and climb back up to stay at point B. As the ﬁctitious particle moves from A to B
in Fig. 5.6, the electrostatic potential φ makes a monotonic transition from φA to φB
as required by the double layer. To ensure that φA and φB are asymptotic states of
the double layer potential, Ψ must be maxima at points A and B. To ensure that the
transition from A to B can take place, Ψ must have a minimum between A and B.
Thus, the conditions for the existence of double layer solutions are
(1) Ψ < 0, ϕA < ϕ < ϕB
(5.16)
(2) ΨA = 0, Ψ′
A = 0, ΨB = 0, Ψ′
B = 0,
(5.17)
(3) Ψ′′
A < 0, Ψ′′
B < 0,
(5.18)
Double layer solutions are guaranteed if the electron and ion distribution func-
tions are such that the resulting Ψ satisﬁes Eqs. (5.16)–(5.18).

5.3 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Double Layers
By their very nature, double layers are nonuniform in density and produce particle
beams with non-Maxwellian velocity distributions. Moreover, the formation of dou-
ble layers is a time-dependent problem. For these reasons, the evolution of double
layers is often studied by numerical simulation.
Numerical simulation has certain advantages over laboratory experiment and
space-satellite observation. Numerical diagnostics do not perturb the system. Ad-
ditionally, the orbits of the particles and their phase-space densities, easily obtained
from simulations, are nearly impossible to obtain from real plasmas, and instan-
taneous multi-point measurements are impractical in space plasmas and strongly
perturbing in the laboratory. Moreover, the electrons and ions can be delineated in a
simulation and help to unfold the physical mechanisms at work. This is impossible
in real plasmas. The basic problems of double layers that simulations hope to solve
are as follows
1. What is their geometry and structure and how is this related to the plasma
parameters?
2. What is their generation mechanism?
3. What are their stability properties?
Double layers have been simulated by two types of computer programs: parti-
cle codes and Vlasov codes. In particle codes large numbers of particles are moved
according to Eqs. (1.1)–(1.5) (Chap.8). Vlasov simulations manipulate particle dis-
tribution functions f(x,v) which are resolved on a position-velocity grid.
These two methods are equivalent in the limits of inﬁnite numbers of particles,
vanishingly small time-steps, and inﬁnite spatial resolution. Each type of simulation
has its advantages: boundary conditions on the distribution functions being easier to
implement with the Vlasov method and magnetized and multi-dimensional plasmas
being easier to analyze with the particle method. We utilize the particle approach
throughout; the Vlasov method is reviewed by Borovosky (1984).

5 Double Layers in Astrophysics
5.3.1 Simulations of the Two-Stream Instability
Since current-conducting plasma can form double layers once a threshold in current
density is passed, it is of some interest to examine the events leading up to double
layers in current ﬂows. The ﬂow of electrons through ions is subject to the Bune-
man (two-stream) instability as given by the linear treatment of Sect. 2.7.2. As the
formation of a double layer involves trapped populations of electrons and ions, an
extension of the linear analysis to quasilinear and nonlinear regimes is necessary.
Some indication that the Buneman instability might lead to double layers is
given by the fact that plasma is unstable to an electron-ion two stream insta-
bility if the drift velocity of the electrons exceeds the electron thermal velocity,
V0 > 1.3vTe (Buneman 1959), while theory (Block 1972; Carlqvist 1972) and ex-
periments (Torv´en and Andersson 1979) have shown the threshold for strong double
layers1 is V0 > vTe.2 Additionally, both phenomena are electrostatic in nature.
The nonlinear evolution of the Buneman instability was studied by Hirose and
Langdon (1981) who employed a one-dimensional PIC simulation model of a force-
free plasma (Ez = 0). Under the condition V0 ≫vTe the Buneman instability can
develop with the maximum growth rate and frequency,

at resonance kV0 = ωpe. The Buneman instability is “strong” (i.e., Γ > ω). However,
the linear regime cannot persist more than a few growth periods because of strong
nonlinear effects. These nonlinear effects are (i) the deceleration of the electron
beam (anomalous resistivity), (ii) consequent electron heating, (iii) modiﬁcation of
Γ and ω, and (iv) electron trapping.
There are two time scales of interest in the nonlinear evolution of the Buneman
instability. The ﬁrst is the time at which the exponential growth expγt terminates
(Fig. 5.7). The second is the time when electron trapping sets in. Figure 5.7 shows
that after electron trapping begins, the electric ﬁeld energy density oscillates at twice
the ion plasma frequency. (The oscillation has the nature of a standing wave; the
electric ﬁeld and ions exchange energy at this frequency. It is not a complete stand-
ing wave since neither ﬁeld nor ion kinetic energy become zero.) This oscillation is
1 A DL is said to be “strong” if the energies acquired by the ions and electrons accelerated by
the potential difference φDL are very large compared to the energies of the incoming and reﬂected
particles. The internal DL structure is then determined by the accelerated particles, which may be
treated approximately as cold beams.

distribution of trapped ions (Bohm and Torven, 1987) .

5.3 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Double Layers

a manifestation of strong ion oscillations at the nonlinear stage of the instability. The
role of the Buneman instability is to create large amplitude ion density perturbations
at a wavelength that corresponds to the most unstable mode.
The following sequence of events lead to electron trapping. When the ﬁeld energy
reaches a saturation plateau, the electron drift velocity V0 approaches zero and then
takes on negative values. When this occurs, the linear assumption of electrons freely
streaming through ions is no longer valid. The electrons begin to reﬂex in the axial
coordinate and rotate in phase space. This is depicted by the phase space vortices
as shown in Fig. 5.8. The phenomena observed resembles that associated with the
Kelvin-Helmholtz ﬂuid instability.
The trapped electrons follow different orbits with different periods due to the
nonadiabatic nature of the trapping. This causes the phase space “smearing” seen at
later times in the simulation. The region for which V0 = 0 and a substantial number
of electrons are reﬂected backwards is called a virtual cathode. Hirose et al. did
not observe reﬂexing in ion motion but did note that the kinetic energy of the ions
acquired 10 % of the initial electron drift energy.
Boris et al. (1970) studied the two-stream instability when Ez ̸= 0. In their simula-
tion a current was driven by imposing a axial electric ﬁeld in the simulation region.
They simulated an electron-positron plasma with periodic boundary conditions in
both one and two dimensions. The electrons leaving the simulation region to the
right, or the positrons leaving to the left, were re-introduced at the opposite bound-
ary at the same exit vertical position (2D) and same exit velocity. Since mi = me,
the growth rate is large Eq. (5.19) and phase space vortices rapidly appear. Because

of the periodic boundary conditions and the axial electric ﬁeld, collective runaway
of some of the electrons was observed. One of their observations was that electron
heating by the two-stream instability tended to conserve the condition vTe ≈V0 as
the drift velocity increased.
5.3.2 Simulations of Double Layers
Simulations of double layers may involve one or two dimensions in space. The
one dimensional system requires far less central processor time but suffers from
excluding transverse particle motions associated with expansion or contraction, heat
loss at surfaces, and a realistic magnetic ﬁeld strength (the magnetic ﬁeld strength
may be taken as inﬁnite in a 1D simulation since there can be no transverse losses).
Two dimensional simulations may be run with or without the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld.
To date, almost all PIC simulations of double layers have been electrostatic; again
the cost of running a fully electromagnetic simulation is a major consideration.
In PIC simulation, boundary conditions must be speciﬁed for both the ﬁelds and
the particles. For ﬁeld conditions, one may either specify a particular boundary as
being metallic (with tangential electric ﬁelds set to zero), wave transmitting as in

5.4 Double Layers in Current Filaments

free-space, or an axis of symmetry. Conductors may be placed at or within the
boundaries and their potentials ﬁxed or allowed to ﬂoat with respect to some ref-
erence conductor. The conductors are often made “transparent” to act as grids, so
that particles may accelerate through potential gradients. Sometimes a periodic ﬁeld
or potential boundary condition is speciﬁed. For this case φ (0) = φ (L), where L is
the dimension of the system. Since a double layer has a potential drop, periodic ﬁeld
boundary conditions may only be used when the double layer is small compared to
the system length.
The particle boundary conditions may be reﬂecting, absorbing, or periodic. If pe-
riodic, ve,i (0) = ve,i (L). Much has been learned about the nature of double layers
from periodic boundary conditions. However, since the electron and ion beam ve-
locities are unidirectional, the double layer can be simulated only for times shorter
than a particle transit time. For this reason, periodic particle boundary conditions do
not allow the full growth of double layers.
In nonperiodic simulations neither the potential or the particle velocity vectors
are periodic. Nonperiodic simulations can either have a ﬂoating or self-adjusting
potential, or else have a ﬁxed potential, across the system. The ﬁrst case corresponds
to a constant current source; the second case is a constant voltage source. Both are
appropriate to study double layers which appear as elements in an electric circuit.
5.4 Double Layers in Current Filaments
Observations show that electric currents in cosmic plasmas often tend to ﬂow in thin
ﬁlaments or sheets. Particularly in ﬁlaments, the current density may reach compar-
atively high values. Hence, as suggested by laboratory experiments, the conditions
for double layer formation in ﬁlaments are optimal.
A double layer that occurs in a current ﬁlament cannot, however, be strictly one-
dimensional but must constitute a two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure.
To clarify the physics of such a layer as studied in 2D simulations, we shall consider
the following simple model.
Consider an electric circuit which contains a plasma ﬁlament. The ﬁlament has
the radius of cross section a and carries a current density j0 so that the total ﬁlamen-
tary current is I0 = πa2 j0. The length scale of the circuit is l implying an inductance
of the order L ≈μ0l. Hence, the magnetic energy Eq. (3.39)
WB = 1
2LI2
0 ≈1
2 μ0lI2
0
(5.21)
is stored in the circuit.
We now assume that a double layer with the potential drop φDL is formed in the
ﬁlament. Inside the layer, stored magnetic energy is released as kinetic energy of the
particles accelerated through the layer. The power developed by the layer is
PDL ≈I0ϕDL
(5.22)

188
5 Double Layers in Astrophysics
Hence, we obtain the time constant for the release of the stored energy
τB = WB
PDL
≈μ0lI0
2ϕDL
(5.23)
The ions and electrons accelerated in the double layer form beams when leaving
the layer (Fig. 5.1). These beams exert a pressure upon the plasma surrounding the
layer. As a result of this, the double layer may expand (or explode). The expansion
leads to a growing potential drop across the layer and even larger beam pressures.
As long as the double layer has a thickness d that is small compared with its radial
extension a, the one-dimensional theory is approximately applicable. However, if
the thickness grows larger, a two-dimensional treatment becomes necessary.
In order to get an idea of what the potential drop of the double layer may be in
this latter case we consider a capacitor consisting of two circular plates of radius
a separated by the distance d. The two plates are charged with the constant surface
charge densities +σC and −σC. When d ≪a the potential drop between the plates is
ϕC = σCd/ε0
(5.24)
(i.e., the same as in a purely one-dimensional geometry). The potential φC is then
proportional to the separation d. For larger separation, φC grows more slowly with
d. Finally, when d ≫a the potential drop tends to the constant and maximum value
ϕCm = σCa/ε0
(5.25)
Notice that Eq. (5.25) may be formally obtained from the potential drop in the
one-dimensional case by putting d = a.
The charge distribution in the relativistic double layer is in several respects simi-
lar to the charge distribution in the capacitor considered above. In both cases there is
a pronounced charge separation while the total charge is equal to zero. Furthermore,
the positive “surface” charge density at the anode boundary of the relativistic dou-
ble layer appears to be independent of the thickness of the layer, just as the surface
charge density of the capacitor is independent of the separation between the plates.
Hence, when the thickness of the double layer d is much larger than the radius a we
should expect the potential drop of the layer to approach the maximum value
ϕDLm =
ϕi j0a2
4ε0c
1/2
(5.26)
corresponding to the one-dimensional potential drop given by Eq. (5.12) with d = a
and j = j0. In terms of the ﬁlamentary current I0, Eq. (5.26) may be rewritten as
ϕDLm =
 ϕiI0
4πε0c
1/2
(5.27)

5.5 Basic Properties of Double Layers
189
Thus, the maximum potential drop of the relativistic double layer is a function
of the total current rather than of the current density. In Fig. 5.4 φDLm is shown as a
function of I0 in the relativistic regime.
The potential φDLm as described by Eq. (5.27) constitutes the maximum potential
drop that can be sustained by the double layer. One condition for to be approached is,
as we have seen above, that the double layer expands so that its thickness becomes
larger than its radius. There is, however, another condition which depends on the
circuit that also has to be fulﬁlled if φDL is to approach φDLm. Due to the fact that
the magnetic energy stored in the current ﬁlament cannot be released faster than the
Alfv´en travel time Eq. (2.22) along the ﬁlament, there is an upper limit to the power
that can be supplied by the circuit. For φDLm to be reached, this power has to be at
least equal to the maximum power of the double layer I0φDLm. This condition seems
to be well met in cosmic circuits.
5.5 Basic Properties of Double Layers
5.5.1 Double Layers as a Surface Phenomena
If an electrical discharge is produced between an anode and a cathode (Fig. 5.9), a
cathode sheath forms near the cathode and serves to accelerate electrons that carry a
current through the plasma. This sheath, a “virtual cathode,” is one layer of the dou-
ble layer. Similarly, a “virtual anode” is set up near the anode, protecting the plasma
from this electrode. Again, a space charge layer constitutes the border between the
double layer and the plasma. The double layers carry electric currents.
The lateral limitation of the plasma is also produced by double layers, which
reduce and slow the escape of fast electrons and also accelerate ions outwards, so
that ambipolar diffusion is established (no net current). The walls of an enclosing
vessel take on a negative charge while a positive space charge layer forms to act

as a border between the double layer and the contained plasma. If the discharge
constricts itself, the walls can be removed (without removing the space charge), and
the net electric current is zero in the lateral double layers.
If the plasma is inhomogenous in chemical composition, density, and electron
temperature, double layers may form to “cellularize” the plasma into regions which
are, more or less, homogeneous. For example, Birkeland currents ﬂowing between
the ionosphere and magnetosphere may produce a series of double layers as the
currents ﬂow through regions with different densities.
There are innumerable variations and complications of the cases we have dis-
cussed, just as biological cell walls show innumerable variations. Another example
of this is the formation of a double layer when the current through a plasma is in-
creased by increasing the applied voltage. The double layer so formed takes up part
of the voltage and thereby “clamps” the current to some threshold value. Hence, the
plasma divides itself into two cells, analogous to what a biological cell does when
it gets a large energy input.
The voltage difference Δφ over a double layer is usually of the order 5–10 times
the equivalent of the temperature kTe/e. However, if there are two independent plas-
mas produced by two different sources, the energy may be as high as 100–1,000
kTe/e in the double layer produced between the plasmas.
5.5.2 Noise and Fluctuations in Double Layers
Concomitant with double layers are noise and rapid ﬂuctuations. Lindberg (1982)
found that noise (i.e., rapid variations within a broad spectral band) was associated
with a broadening of the energy spectrum of the electrons. The effect of noise is
to scatter the electrons in the beam that is produced within a double layer so that
plasma expansion across the conﬁning magnetic ﬁeld is possible. The noise scatter-
ing mechanism can greatly exceed the scattering due to collisions between electrons.
5.5.3 Exploding Double Layers
Since double layers form in electrical currents, the double layer itself can be consid-
ered an element within the complete electrical circuit. Figure 5.10 depicts a simple
series circuit in which a current I ﬂows that contains a generator, motor, resistance,
inductance, and a double layer.
If φ > 0, we have a generator transferring plasma power φI into the circuit; if
φ < 0 we have a motor transferring circuit energy into kinetic energy of the plasma.
The circuit also has a resistance R which dissipates power I2R into heat, and an
inductance L in which circuit energy is stored (Eq.(3.39)).
In most cosmic plasma situations the individual circuit elements must be replaced
with elements that are distributed over cosmic distances. Thus, even the conducting

Fig. 5.10 Series circuit containing a voltage source, resistance, inductance, motor, and double
layer. Circuit energy in the “motor” is used to accelerate the plasma
“wire” itself, connecting the circuit elements, must be replaced by a transmission
line representation of the current-carrying, ﬁeld-aligned, pinched cosmic plasma
ﬁlament conductors (Appendix A).
Every circuit that contains an inductance L is intrinsically explosive. The induc-
tive energy Eq. (3.39) can be tapped at any point of the circuit. Any interruption of
the current I results in the transfer of the inductively stored energy to the point of in-
terruption. By its nature, this point is most often a double layer which then releases
energy at a rate
P = IφDL
(5.28)
where φDL is the voltage drop across the double layer. This energy is mainly used
for accelerating charged particles, with a small percent released in the generation of
noise. Secondary effects associated with the particle acceleration include localized
heating and radiation.
5.5.4 Oblique Double Layers
In space, double layers are often associated with magnetic ﬁelds, and the trajectories
of the double layer electrons and ions are inﬂuenced by B. When the double layer
ﬁeld E is not parallel to B, the magnetized double layer is referred to as an oblique
double layer (Fig. 5.11) (Borovosky 1984).
Magnetized double layers usually have scale thicknesses of approximately 20λD
(where λD is the Debye length of the hottest species of particles passing through
the DL), regardless of their orientation with respect to B (an exception occurs if E
is not precisely perpendicular to B). Depending on the properties of the plasma on
either side of the DL, the oblique magnetized DL will drift at velocities up to the ion
acoustic speed. Owing to the transfer of momentum from the beam to the electrons
in the high-potential plasma via two-stream instabilities, the predominant direction

192

Fig. 5.11 The coordinate system of an oblique double layer. The angle between the double layer
normal and B0 is denoted as θ = θDL
of the DL drift is in the direction of the emitted electron beam. The orientation of
ﬁelds in Fig. 5.11, when applied to a sheet beam geometry, makes the oblique DL a
naturally occurring analog of the smooth bore magnetron (Sect. 1.7.3).
5.6 Examples of Cosmic Double Layers
5.6.1 Double Layers in the Auroral Circuit
The auroral circuit is by far the best known of all cosmic circuits (Alfv´en, 1986). It
is derived from a large number of measurements in the magnetosphere and in the
ionosphere. A simpliﬁed schematic of the picture that has evolved of the auroral
circuit is shown in Fig. 5.12. Magnetospheric convection produces an emf φ0 which
drives a ﬁeld aligned current j||. The ionosphere is represented by a resistance R.

5.6 Examples of Cosmic Double Layers
193
DLs form in the plasma region to produce a ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁeld which accel-
erates electrons and ions in opposite directions.
On auroral ﬁeld lines, the current-carrying electrons and the oppositely stream-
ing ions are governed by conditions external to the double layer and therefore can be
speciﬁed fully as boundary conditions for simulations. The trapped ions on auroral
ﬁeld lines are mostly plasma-sheet thermal ions of keV energy on the low-potential
side of the double layer; therefore the distribution function of the trapped ions can
be speciﬁed externally as a boundary condition. On the other hand, the trapped elec-
trons on auroral ﬁeld lines with sufﬁcient energy to penetrate deep into the double
layer are produced mostly by the backscattering of the streaming electrons due to
charge-neutral collisions in the ionosphere on the downstream side of the double
layer; or are a combination of both. The ionospheric electrons of energy less than
1 eV are of no consequence because they are unable to contribute to the space charge
inside the double layer. Therefore, the trapped electrons can not be prescribed as a
boundary condition (Singh et al. 1986).
Since the trapped ions and the streaming electrons and ions on auroral ﬁeld
lines can be speciﬁed as boundary conditions, one can determine the density of
the trapped electrons as a function of φ from Eqs. (5.16) to (5.18) for ψ for the ex-
istence of double layer solutions. This result provides an explicit constraint on the
distribution function of the trapped electrons, but still cannot answer the question on
realizability of the solution. To answer this question unambiguously, one must treat
the double layer formation as an initial value problem so that the production of the
trapped electrons can be followed in time. The transition from a localized DL to an
extended DL has been shown to depend predominantly on the energy of the trapped
electrons (Kan and Akasofu 1989).
An immediate question that comes to mind is what controls the ﬁeld-aligned
scale length of a double layer? The boundary conditions on the ionospheric side of
the auroral double layer are uniquely different from the classic double layer. First,
the converging geomagnetic ﬁeld is favorable for retaining the trapped particles
on the ionospheric side. Secondly, the partially ionized ionosphere is a source of
trapped particles due to the backscattered primary and secondary electrons produced
Fig. 5.12 A model of coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. (adapted from Sato and Okuda
1981)

194
5 Double Layers in Astrophysics
by the auroral electrons. This is in contrast to the classic double layer in which the
trapped particles can only be produced by instabilities, and with no magnetic mirror
to help maintain the trapped-particle population.
Figure 5.14 shows the double layer simulations results of Yamamoto and Kan
(1985). The ﬁeld-aligned scale length L|| of a double layer varies from (a) local-
ized to about a ten Debye lengths in the absence the backscattered primary elec-
trons and the hot magnetospheric ions, to (b) a partially extended in the presence
of the backscattered primary electrons, and (c) to become fully extended across the
entire simulation domain if both the backscattered primary electrons and the mag-
netospheric hot ions are present. Figure 5.14d shows that the fully extended double
layer remains fully extended under the same condition as in Fig. 5.14c except that
the length of the simulation domain is double in length. This result clearly indi-
cates that the ﬁeld aligned scale length of a double layer is controlled by the energy
of the trapped-particle populations. The scale length increases as the energy of the
trapped-particle population increases.

Oblique DLs (Sect. 5.5.4) have been suggested as causes of ion conics (beams of
ions whose angular distributions have a minima in the ﬁeld-aligned direction), and
auroral kilometric radiation (Borovosky 1984, 1988).3 Figure 5.15 illustrates the tra-
jectories of various magnetized initially magnetic ﬁeld-aligned ions passing through
an oblique DL. In unmagnetized DLs, the ion motion is along E. As the strength of
the magnetic ﬁeld increases, the ion trajectories become increasingly aligned along
B. In studying ion conics, Borovosky ﬁnds a transition between electric ﬁeld align-
ment and magnetic ﬁeld alignment in the parameter range 2.18 ≤ωciτcr ≤8.72,
where τcr is the time required for an ion to be accelerated across the oblique DL.
3 Auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) (Sect. 1.8.1) is bursty electromagnetic emission originating
in the dusk and evening auroral zone at geocentric radii of 2–4 Re. The radiation is believed to
be emitted at frequencies near the local electron cyclotron frequency. The power levels of AKR
emission are highest during times of geomagnetic activity, and the emission is correlated with the
presence of precipitating high-energy electrons, with the presence of Birkeland currents, and with
the presence of auroral arcs. The radiation is believed to be emitted with wave vectors that are
nearly perpendicular to the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld, but tilted slightly earthward. It is also thought
that the extraordinary mode dominates in AKR. Because of the rising or falling in frequency of
the bursts, the source region is envisioned to move down or up the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld at
approximately the local ion acoustic speed.

5.6 Examples of Cosmic Double Layers
195
Simulations of oblique DLs show electromagnetic wave properties similar to that
of AKR (Borovosky 1988). The emitted waves have frequencies slightly above and
slightly below the local electron cyclotron frequency ( fce ∼30 kHz, λce ∼10 km),
and the waves are emitted primarily in the north-south (constant longitude) direc-
tion. In the auroral zone, the DL drift in the electron sheet beam direction, carries it
along the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld, toward the poles (Fig. 5.16). Borovosky (1988)
ﬁnds a power of P ∼1.2 × 106 W per discrete auroral arc element. The observation
that a typical arc consists of 5 elements requires the presence of 16–160 arcs in the
auroral zone to produce 100 MW-1 GW of AKR. The total efﬁciency of auroral
arc electron kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation is ∼0.5 % (smooth bore
magnetrons typically achieve efﬁciencies of a few percent).
5.6.2 Solar Flares
Solar ﬂares are the result of a sudden irreversible release of energy in the corona
and chromosphere of the sun. These lead to particle acceleration observed mainly
in the range 104−105 eV, and to a transient heating of the chromosphere (to ≈1 eV
(104 K)) and corona (to ≈103 eV (107 K)). Electromagnetic radiation is produced
over an extremely broad range from radio up to X and even γ ray frequencies.
A typical ﬂare passes through a sequence of phases. There is an initial preﬂare
or preheating phase lasting around 10 min characterized by a slow optical bright-
ening with an accompanying rise in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X ray
emission. This is followed by a short explosive or impulsive phase (∼1 min) during
which there are impulsive emissions of hard X rays, EUV, and microwaves (i.e., the
most energetic nonthermal events). There is a rise to maximum brightness and emis-
sion in soft X rays and EUV during the 5–15min ﬂash phase, followed by a slow
decline in the main phase (∼1 h). Flashes occur mainly in active regions, containing
sunspots and a generally enhanced magnetic ﬁeld, and are believed to derive their
energy through this ﬁeld. There are strong arguments for the storage of energy in the
magnetic ﬁeld [i.e., as inductive energy in an extended current system (Sect. 3.7)].
Estimates of the energy release due to changes in the magnetic ﬁeld topology are
of the right order of magnitude. The total energy released in a ﬂare is in a range
extending over more than three orders of magnitude, from ≈1022 J for a typical
subﬂare to ≈3 × 1025 J in the most energetic cases. For large ﬂares this energy is
roughly equally divided between electromagnetic radiation, energetic particles, and
shock waves propagating outward into the solar wind region (Priest 1982). Flare
“areas” are reported for the extent of the Hα emission at maximum intensity and
range from less than 3 × 108 km2 for subﬂares, and from 7.5 × 108 km2 to over
3.6 × 109 km2 for major ﬂares. High-resolution observations reveal small (diame-
ter ∼3,000–6,000km) impulsive ﬂare kernels with enhanced brightness associated
with the X ray bursts. Small-scale “compact” ﬂares may take the form of simple
loops accompanied in some cases by surges. The much larger “two-ribbon” ﬂares,
so called from the pair of Hα emission regions in the form of long ribbons observed

The right hand potential is ﬁxed at 10.0
during the ﬂash phase, are closely associated with a prior ﬁlament destabilization
and eruption (Bernstein et al. 1957).
Currents in the solar atmosphere are inferred from magnetic ﬁeld measurements.
If the magnetic ﬁeld B is known, the current density j can be derived from Eq.(1.2),
∇×B = μ0j. By measuring the transverse component of the magnetic ﬁeld Severny
(1965) found that vertical currents of the order of 1011 A exist in the neighborhood
of sunspots.
Moreton and Severny (1968) have pointed out a remarkable coincidence between
the bright knots appearing during the initial phase of ﬂares and spots with a vertical
current density larger than 8 × 10−3 A m−2. The currents can either ﬂow outward
or inward from the spots. The measured diameter of the spots is comparable with
the observational resolution ≈7′′ corresponding to a distance ∼5 × 106 m on the
sun. With a current density j = 8 × 10−3 A m−2 and with a diameter of the current
elements of 5 × 106 m one obtains a total current of I ∼2 × 1011 A.

high-potential plasma through an oblique (θDL = 79.7◦) double layer. The functional form of the
double layer is contained in the inset to the bottom right
Since the apparent diameters of the spots are of the same order as the resolution
it is possible that the real diameter might be still smaller. This would lead to an
enhanced current density compared with the measured one.
In the corona and in most of the chromosphere the magnetic pressure pB =
B2/2μ0 far exceeds the kinetic pressure of the plasma as soon as the magnetic ﬁeld is
larger than ≈10−3 T (10 G). This implies that any stationary current system induc-
ing magnetic ﬁelds larger than ≈10−3, must be nearly force-free with the current
almost parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld. Otherwise kinetic pressure forces cannot bal-
ance the j × B forces. For example, a current of the order of 2× 1011 A, constricted
to an area with a diameter equal to or less than 5× 106 m, must be force-free since
it induces a magnetic ﬁeld larger than 10−2 T (102 G).

198
5 Double Layers in Astrophysics
As shown in Sect. 1.7.2, a force-free current system has a tendency to form a
narrow ﬁlament with most of the total current and magnetic ﬂux conﬁned within it.
Inside the ﬁlament the magnetic-ﬁeld lines will assume helical shapes.
The results obtained by Moreton and Severny (1968) indicate that such a current
ﬁlament can pass from one point in a sunspot group through the chromosphere and
through the lower corona and then back again to another point in the same group
(Fig. 5.17). Hence, the length of the ﬁlament l should be comparable with the typical
dimension of a sunspot group ∼107 −108 m. The current circuit might ﬁnally be
closed in the deeper layers of the solar body where non-force-freeconditions prevail.

5.6 Examples of Cosmic Double Layers

where the ﬁrst and second terms correspond to the magnetic energy stored inside
and outside the ﬁlament, respectively (Akasofu 1988; Carlqvist 1969).
For a circular current loop of radius R consisting of a current channel of radius
a, the internal and external inductances in vacuum are

resembling that of the force-free ﬁlament.
We can now use the circular loop as a model of the current ﬁlament in the solar
atmosphere in order to estimate the inductance of the ﬁlament. Because of the high
conductivity of the solar atmosphere it is likely that a considerable part of the mag-
netic ﬁeld outside the ﬁlament will be screened by the plasma. The external induc-
tance of the ﬁlament may therefore be much reduced compared with the vacuum
case. On the other hand, the internal inductance of the current ﬁlament would be
comparable with the internal inductance of the circular current loop. With a radius
of the current ﬁlament ≈l/2 ≈5 × 106 −5 × 107, we then obtain an inductance of
the ﬁlament of the order of L ≈3 −30H.
The total ﬁlamentary current needed to produce a stored magnetic energy com-
parable with the energy of a ﬂare Wf = LI2/2 ≈1021 −1025 J is in the range
I ≈1010 −1012 A.
If we assume that the ﬁlamentary current is mainly carried by electrons and pro-
tons, the maximum potential drop of a double layer in the ﬁlament is, according to
Eq. (5.27), φDLm ≈9 × 1010 V (90 GV). The time constant for energy release con-
nected with this potential drop is from Eq. (5.23) tB ≈2 × 102 s. It is to be noticed
that both WB and τB in Example 5.1 are of the same magnitudes as the total energy
and the time constant of solar ﬂares, respectively. Hence, the double layer constitutes
a mechanism that is capable of releasing the ﬂare energy during the brief explosive
phase observed.
The analysis of observations from the Solar Maximum Years have led to an im-
proved understanding of the build-up phase of solar ﬂares and of the energy release.
Hard X ray and microwave bursts have been found to have ﬁne structure on time
scales of a few tens of milliseconds. During the impulsive phase, hard X ray emis-
sion is observed at the foot of loops with microwave emission from the tops. Of
particular interest for models with acceleration by strongly relativistic DLs is the
observation of energetic neutrons (50–500MeV, where the upper limit is uncertain
and may be much greater) produced during the impulsive phase. The DL model is
able to meet the rather stringent requirements for the acceleration mechanism set
by the observations, both as regards to the time scale and number of high-energy
protons which produce the neutrons (Carlqvist 1986). Further evidence of accelera-
tion to very high energies comes from observations of g ray emission due to protons

200
5 Double Layers in Astrophysics
(Ryan et al. 1983). In the context of these results the DL has the advantage of ac-
counting for the acceleration to very high energies and allowing extremely rapid
time variations, since its structure can vary on the local ion transit time scale.
5.6.3 Double Radio Galaxies and Quasars
Double layers produce beams of electrons and, on astrophysical scales, these beams
are relativistic. The beams are also directed along B0 so that the expected loss mech-
anism for the beam kinetic energy is synchrotron radiation. The formation of a series
of DLs in a network of current-conducting plasmas thus leads to an interesting prob-
lem regarding total synchrotron intensity, background radiation levels, and isophotal
patterns. This problem is addressed in some detail in Chap. 6.
5.6.4 Double Layers as a Source of Cosmic Radiation
It is of interest to compare the cosmic particle acceleration discussed in Sect. 5.6.2
with some energetic cosmic particle observations. Very energetic particles–
primarily protons–are recorded on earth following large solar ﬂares. The proton
energies can be many tens of GeV after such an event.
It has been demonstrated by Chupp et al. (1982) that the sun also emits neutrons
of high energy. Just after a solar γ ray impulsive burst, indicating the onset of a
strong (1B) ﬂare, neutrons with energies at least as high as 6×108 eV were detected
at the earth. The production of such neutrons requires that protons be accelerated to
GeV energies, probably within a 20 s time interval corresponding to the impulsive
phase. As pointed out by Chupp et al., this short time imposes a strong constraint on
the properties of the particle accelerator operating in the ﬂare region.
In Sect. 5.6.2 we found that a double layer in a solar ﬁlament carrying the cur-
rent I = 3 × 1011 can sustain a maximum potential drop of about φDLm ≈9 × 1010.
This means that such a layer is capable of accelerating particles to energies that
correspond to the highest solar cosmic ray energies observed.
As regards the high-energy neutron event detected by Chupp et al., a solar double
layer seems to meet the very special requirements on the acceleration mechanism
imposed by the observations. First, the double layer is able to accelerate a fairly large
ﬂux of protons, ψp ≈1030 s−1. Second, the time of acceleration of each particle
in the layer is very short–only a fraction of a second. Hence, the total number of
protons N20 = 20ψp = 2 × 1031 of GeV energy can be directly produced by the
double layer during the 20 s time interval of the impulsive burst. In addition to this,
it is likely that many more particles of lower energy are generated by the primary
particles through secondary processes in the solar atmosphere.

Fig. 5.4 gives a value φDL ≈3 × 1017 V in the relativistic regime. If the voltage
is actually distributed over a series of double layers extending for 10 kpc in the
ﬁlament, the average electric ﬁeld strength is 1 mV/m. The total energy of an ion that
has been accelerated through the double layers is 3×1017 eV. This energy is similar
to that derived by Vlasov et al. (1989) for pinched plasma currents as a source of
cosmic rays. The time constant for the release of energy Eq. (5.22) is TB = 2 × 109
years. The time rate of energy release Eq. (5.28) is 3 × 1037 W.

Synchrotron Radiation
Electromagnetic waves propagated in cosmic space derive from a variety of mecha-
nisms. The major contribution in the optical region of the spectrum is from radiation
resulting from bound-bound electron transitions between discrete atomic or molec-
ular states, free-bound transitions during recombination, and free-free transitions in
the continuum. In the latter case, when for transitions between levels, radiation clas-
siﬁed as bremsstrahlung results from the acceleration of electrons traveling in the
vicinity of the atom or ion.
In addition, there are other mechanisms of considerable importance operating in
the radio region. In particular, there are noncoherent and coherent mechanisms con-
nected with the existence of sufﬁciently dense plasmas which are responsible for
radiation derived from plasma oscillations, such as the sporadic solar radio emis-
sions. This radiation cannot be attributed to the motion of individual electrons in a
vacuum but is due to the collective motion of electrons at the plasma frequency

for an electron density ne (m−3). This often occurs in cosmic plasma when electron
beams propagate through a neutralizing plasma background (Sect. 2.9).
When a plasma is subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld there is yet another mechanism
which plays an extremely important role in radio astronomy. The frequency and
angular distribution of the radiation from free electrons moving in the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld undergoes dramatic changes as the electron energy is increased from
nonrelativistic to extreme relativistic energies. Essentially three types of spectra are
found. Names such as cyclotron emission and magnetobremsstrahlung are used to
describe the emission from nonrelativistic and mildly relativistic electron energies,
whereas the name synchrotron radiation is traditionally reserved for highly relativis-
tic electrons because it was ﬁrst observed in 1948 in electron synchrotrons.
Synchrotron radiation is characterized by a generation of frequencies appreciably
higher than the cyclotron frequency of electrons (or positrons) in a magnetic ﬁeld,

6 Synchrotron Radiation
a continuous spectra whose intensity decreases with frequency beyond a certain
critical frequency, highly directed beam energies, and polarized electromagnetic
wave vectors.
In astrophysics, nonthermal (nonequilibrium) cosmic radio emission is, in a
majority of cases, synchrotron radiation. This is true for general galactic radio emis-
sion, radio emission from the envelopes of supernovae, and radio emission from
double radio galaxies and quasars (continuum spectra). Synchrotron radiation also
appears at times as sporadic radio emission from the sun, as well as from Jupiter. In
addition, optical synchrotron radiation is observed in some instances (Crab nebula,
the radiogalaxy and “jet” in M87-NGC 4486, M82, and others). This apparently is
also related to the continuous optical spectrum sometimes observed in solar ﬂares.
Synchrotron radiation in the X ray region can also be expected in several cases,
particularly from the Crab nebula.
When cosmic radio or optical emission has the characteristics of synchrotron
radiation, a determination of the spectrum makes possible a calculation of the con-
centration and energy spectrum of the relativistic electrons in the emission sources.
Therefore, the question of cosmic synchrotron radiation is closely connected with
the physics and origin of cosmic rays and with gamma- and X ray astronomy.
Synchrotron radiation was ﬁrst brought to the attention of astronomers by Alfv´en
and Herlofson (1950), a remarkable suggestion at a time when plasma and magnetic
ﬁelds were thought to have little, if anything, to do in a cosmos ﬁlled with “island”
universes (galaxies).1 The recognition that this mechanism of radiation is important
in astronomical sources has been one of the most fruitful developments in astro-
physics. For example, it has made possible the inference that high-energy particles
exist in many types of astronomical objects, it has given additional evidence for the
existence of extensive magnetic ﬁelds, and it has indicated that enormous amounts
of energy may indeed be converted, stored, and released in cosmic plasma.
6.1 Theory of Radiation from an Accelerated Charge
In this section we give, for reference purposes, a series of formulas relating to the
energy spectrum of an accelerated charge. For detailed evaluation of the equations
the reader is referred to texts such as Panosfsky and Phillips (1962).
Consider a charge e in vacuum whose instantaneous position P′(t′) is given by
the vector r(t′) and whose instantaneous velocity is v(t′) (Fig. 6.1); t′ is the time at
which the signal propagated at velocity c is emitted at P′(t′) to arrive at the position
of the observer P(t) at a time t. The “retarded” time t′ is related to t through
t′ = t −R(t′)
c
(6.2)
where R(t′) is the distance between e and the observer.
1 The “island universes” concept was introduced by the philosopher Kant (1724–1804).

where η = √ε0/μ0 is the intrinsic impedance of the propagation medium β = v/c
and [...]t′ denotes that the quantity within the brackets is to be evaluated at the
retarded time t′ deﬁned by Eq. (6.2). For nonrelativistic motion β →0.
Equation (6.3) consists of two ﬁeld components. The almost static (induction)
near-ﬁeld can be identiﬁed with the ﬁrst term of Eq.(6.3) which shows it to be
independent of the acceleration of the moving charge.2 The second term of Eq. (6.3)
represents the far ﬁeld or “radiation” ﬁeld. The far ﬁelds E and H vary linearly
with β, exhibit a 1/R fall-off with distance, and are orthogonal to the radius vector.
Delineation of the induction and wave zones is given in Fig. 6.2.
2 A time frame study of the ﬁelds shows that the strength of the “static” component does vary
slowly in time.

where n is a unit vector in the direction of R. Thus, we have recovered the elec-

equivalent to an element of current Idl = eβc, Eq. (6.7) gives

Equation (6.9) is simply the Biot-Savart law equation (3.5). Thus, the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds generated by an accelerated electron give rise to a strong near-ﬁeld
which can be identiﬁed with the Biot-Savart law as-well-as weaker, but propagating,
radiation ﬁelds. It will be shown that the strong near-ﬁelds determine the morphol-
ogy of the radiating region in a plasma, which is then conveyed to an observer a
great distance away via the radiation ﬁelds.
6.1.2 The Radiation Fields
The remainder of Sects. 6.1–6.6 are mainly concerned with the radiation ﬁelds. The
observation point is assumed to be far away from the charge, so that n and R change
negligibly during a small acceleration interval.
The instantaneous energy ﬂux is given by Poynting’s vector
S = E × H = |E|2 n
(6.10)
This means that the power radiated per unit solid angle is

and the polar pattern of the emitted radiation is typically that of an electric dipole
(Fig. 6.3). This limit is referred to as the dipole approximation.

Example 6.1. Total radiation ﬁeld from an ensemble of charge emitters when
λ ≫L. Consider a plasma region of radiating charges of dimension L (Fig. 6.4).
Let Δt be the time required for an appreciable change in particle motion. If rc is
a characteristic scale of the particle’s orbit and v is its velocity, then Δt ∼rc/v.
The condition Δt ≫L/c then implies v/c ≪rc/L. Since rc < L, the nonrelativistic
condition v ≪c is apropos. Under this approximation equation (6.3), for a single
electron, is

the radiation ﬁeld equation (6.16). The effect of the parallel motion v|| is a compo-
nent of the radiation ﬁeld arising from the motion of the charge along B0. This is
illustrated in Fig. 6.9.
If the motion is circular so that v|| = 0 and vbot = v, and if the electron is ultra-
relativistic, the electron will be shown to radiate only in the plane of the orbit. An
observer located in the plane of rotation would see pulses of radiation corresponding
to those instants when the electron is moving precisely towards the observer. The

cases β|| = 0 as β⊥increases and the essentially forward emission in the relativistic
case when β||/β⊥is large.

6.1.5 Frequency Distribution of the Radiation
The energy W(ω,Ω) emitted per unit solid angle per frequency interval dω is given
by Eq.(6.37). To evaluate the exponent appearing in the equation we assume, with-
out loss of generality, that the propagation vector lies in the x−z plane (see Fig. B.2).
Thus,
n = ˆxsinθ + ˆy(0)+ ˆzcosθ

In the two foregoing equations the terms of the series m = 0,−1,−2,... were
eliminated as not meaningful because of the argument of the delta function.
The total radiation in a given harmonic m is obtained by integrating a single
term of the right-hand side of Eq. (6.67) over frequency ω and solid angle dΩ =
2π sinθdθ. The result is Schwinger (1949);

m, given by Eq.(6.68), is the total emission in all direc-

Figure 6.15 plots the characteristic frequencies versus γ. For example, an electron
with γ = 10 (5 MeV) in the presence of a 10−4 G ﬁeld, has a “critical frequency”
ωc/2π ∼42 kHz (α = π/2) whereas a γ = 100 electron (50 MeV) has a “critical
frequency” ∼4.2 MHz. It will be shown that the critical frequency is located near
the frequency at which the spectrum has its maximum value. Otherwise, the “critical
frequency” is only a mathematical artiﬁce and has no physical meaning. The actual
oscillatory frequency of the gyrating electron for these two cases is 28 and 2.8 Hz,
respectively.

6 Synchrotron Radiation
The special functions in Eqs. (6.70) and (6.72) are plotted in Fig. 6.16.
With the substitution ωγ →ωγDS (Eq.(6.47)), the total radiated power from a
single electron at frequency ω (Eq. (6.72)) is divided by the factor sin2 θ. However
this factor is cancelled out if we consider the time average of the power emitted
from a ﬁxed volume element. Consequently, such a correction is unnecessary for
the interpretation of synchrotron emission from radio sources (Scheuer 1968).
The spectrum PT
ω for arbitrary β|| and β⊥may be determined by numerically
evaluating the ... term in Eq. (6.70). The results of these calculations are shown in
Fig. 6.17.

The existence of the ordinary wave is due solely to β|| ̸= 0. As shown in Fig. B.3,
the ordinary wave is linearly polarized along B0 while the extraordinary wave cir-
cumscribes an ellipse in the plane transverse to B0 as it propagates. Since the angle
of propagation (and observation) is θ = π/2, Eqs. (6.73) and (6.74) are linearly
polarized: P(O)
ω
along B0 and P(X)
ω
perpendicular to B0. The Poynting vector equa-
tion (7.2), and therefore the strength of P(X)
ω , is maximum when E(X) is oriented
perpendicular to n. When E(X) rotates sufﬁciently to have a component along the
line-of-sight, a longitudinal plasma wave exists. The mode conversion properties
of an oblique wave propagating in magnetized, nonuniform plasma (i.e., a charac-
teristic of most cosmic plasmas) is beyond the scope of this book and is covered
elsewhere (Peratt and Kuehl 1972).
6.2.2 Polarization for Arbitrary Angles of Observation

larly polarized while when Rm = 0, the wave is linearly polarized. When 0 < Rm < 1,
the wave is elliptically polarized in the ratio of the ﬁeld amplitudes oriented along
the minor and major axes of the ellipse. The polarization of the extraordinary mode
rotates in the same sense as does the radiating electron.
Figure 6.19a depicts R1 for the fundamental m = 1 mode versus y for the case
θ = π/2. As shown, when ψ = 0(θ = π/2), Pω(1) = Pω(0) = 0, and the existing
extraordinary wave is linearly polarized. When ψ ̸= π/2, Pω(1) is ﬁnite and the
wave is elliptically polarized.
Figure 6.20 depicts Rm for higher order harmonics as the angle of observation θ
is decreased. As shown, the polarization remains more closely circular over a larger
range of ψ when m ≫1. A rapid change in the sense of polarization also occurs
when m ≫1. When θ →0, this change occurs for larger values of β||.

Figure 6.20 shows Eqs. (6.84) and (6.85a) versus ω/ωc for various angles of θ.
As shown, the maximum degree of polarization is obtained when θ = π/2, when the
difference between the amplitudes of the orthogonal modes is maximum. For this
case, Π ∼1/2 for ω/ωc ≪1 and Π ∼1 for ω/ωc ≫1. For oblique angles of obser-
vation the degree of polarization falls rapidly for ω/ωc > 1. However, for oblique
angles the independent modes can no longer be delineated into purely ordinary and
extraordinary components.
6.3.2 Emission from an Ensemble of Electrons
We now wish to determine the total power radiated by all electrons which have a
Maxwellian distribution of energies. First, the emission coefﬁcient jω is deﬁned as

6 Synchrotron Radiation
6.4 Synchrotron Radiation from Z Pinches
Charged particle beams held together or pinched by their self-magnetic ﬁelds have
been of general interest since their earliest investigation by Bennett (1934). Con-
ﬁnement in the simple cylindrical pinch is a result of the axial, or z, directed current
Iz; hence, the name “Z” or “zed” pinch, often used in place of Bennett pinch. The
macroscopic picture of such a beam is that of a self-consistent magnetic conﬁne-
ment or compression against the expansion due to thermal pressure equation (1.9).
On the microscopic scale, the individual particle orbits include radial oscillations
due to the Lorentz force equation (1.5) superimposed on the drift in the direction
of mean ﬂow. Since they imply particle acceleration, there is electromagnetic radia-
tion associated with them. Because the force is a v× B force, the radiation from the
relativistic electrons is synchrotron radiation.
Manifestations of the pinch effect appear to the laboratory observer as a rapidly
occurring phenomena. A burst of radiation from high-current discharges (with cur-
rent densities of the order 1011 A/cm2), such as low-inductance vacuum sparks,
plasma focus devices, and exploded wires, is found over a broad spectral range: the
microwave region to the hard X ray region. Recorded data show that the radiation
bursts are correlated with dips in the current waveform. The microwaves observed
are attributed to the synchrotron radiation of electrons in the magnetic ﬁeld of the
proper current. The hard X ray quanta are attributed to synchrotron radiation from
the electrons at the transitions between Landau levels in this same current-induced
magnetic ﬁeld (Meirovich 1984; Peratt and Koert 1985; Trubnikov 1958).
This phenomena may be similar to that of impulsive solar microwave bursts
which are believed to be produced by the synchrotron radiation of electrons acc-
elerated in solar ﬂares (Takakura 1960; Kawabuta 1964; Kai 1965).
Z pinches as sources of synchrotron radiation in the laboratory have been studied
by Meirovich (1984) and by Newberger (1984), who used the Los Alamos PHER-
MEX Facility. PHERMEX produces a 30 MeV (γ ∼57), 1 kA electron beam that is
synchrotron-loss limited in energy. Like the sun, which generates synchrotron radi-
ation and solar radio outbursts at microwave frequencies (1–10GHz), PHERMEX
experiments also produce bursts of microwaves at gigahertz frequencies (Mack et al.
1987).
6.4.1 X Ray Emission
Moderately high atomic number plasma pinches with temperatures in the kilovolt
range have been produced in discharges with megavolt electron energies and cur-
rents up to 5 mA. Figure 6.21 shows a typical experimental setup used to pro-
duce and measure X rays. One or more metallic or glass wires are strung between
the cathode and anode of a pulse power generator diode (Fig. 2.9). Typically, the
wires have diameters of 15 μm, are 3 cm long, and are on a 20 mm array diameter.
Streak and framing cameras and laser shadowgraphy follow the behavior of the plas-

mas produced when the ∼100 ns pulse of energy explodes the wires into Bennett
pinches. The self-consistent magnetic ﬁeld is tens of megagauss in the 0.1–1 mm
pinches.
If more than one wire is exploded, or if a jet of gas is injected between the
cathode-anode gap, copious amounts of X ray radiation are produced. For example,
neon (atomic number 10) produces ∼55 kJ of K-line X rays at hν ∼1 keV at fre-
quency ν while titanium (atomic number 22) plasmas can produce ∼10 kJ of K-line
emission up to hν ∼10 kJ. Figure 6.22 depicts the radiation energy as a function of
the number of exploded wire ﬁlaments. As shown, an order of magnitude enhance-
ment in X rays may be expected if at least two plasma ﬁlaments are present.
Fig. 6.21 Experimental arrangement used to obtain X ray streak and frame photographs of the X
ray source as it evolves in time. The X rays are imaged through a slit onto a strip of scintillator,
which is then viewed by the streak camera through a prism (Reference is made to Figs. 2.9, 2.12,
and 3.18)
6.4.2 X Ray Spectroscopy
X ray pinhole photographs and the spatial correlation of spectral emission show
three types of emission emanating from exploded Z pinches. These are (a) hot-
plasma thermal emission, (b) cool plasma thermal emission, and (c) nonthermal
(synchrotron) emission.
The X ray emission from high-ionization states are recorded as narrow lines
(using a curved crystal spectrograph) corresponding to the excited states of the ele-
ments present in the plasma. The high-temperature emission emanates from pinched
regions along the plasma which emit X rays predominantly in the less than 3.5 keV
energy region. Figure 6.23 shows the spectra produced by a titanium plasma.
Thermal X ray emission is also found from cooler-plasma regions with tempera-
tures between 50 and 200 eV.

234
6 Synchrotron Radiation
In addition to hot- and cool-plasma emission, X rays are also produced by rela-
tivistic electrons in the exploded-wire discharges. These X rays may have energies
as high as ∼8 keV and measurements of the shape and location of the radiating plas-
mas as a function of time show that the nonthermal X rays have time histories of
longer duration than the pinches. The hard X ray emission produced by the energetic
electrons generally begins about 20 ns after the beginning of the low energy X ray
emission from pinches and lasts for the duration of the pulse discharge.
6.4.3 Morphology of the Thermal X Ray Source
Time integrated pinhole camera photography is used to acquire information on the
size and shape of the radiating plasma. A pinhole camera may consist of a metal box
containing the X ray ﬁlm, with a number of pinholes covered by a graded aluminum
foil material to increase the ﬁlm latitude.
A contour plot made from a pinhole photograph is shown in Fig. 6.24 and shows
that the intense X rays originate from hot spots along the plasma that is conﬁned
between the Bennett-pinched exploded wires.5 The dimensions of the X ray hot
spots are <100 mm in diameter; with cores often between 25 and 75 mm diam-
eter. For a typical pinhole photograph with ﬁve hot spots of ∼100 mm diame-
ter emitting 10 kJ of X rays, the energy density per hot spot is 3.8 × 1015 J/m3
(3.8 × 1016 ergs/cm3), making the exploded wire the most copious energy density
producer known of X rays from either laboratory or astrophysical plasmas.
The variability of the thermal X ray radiation, based on the “spikedness” of the
XRD signal, is tens of picoseconds (i.e., corresponding to the speed of light dimen-
sions of the emitting regions). The energy, of course, is supplied by the Marx bank
via the transmission line (Fig. 2.9), both of which are invisible in electromagnetic
emission.
The plasma characteristics determined from the distribution of excitation states
in the exploded-wire spectra corresponds well with those from other high-energy-
density generating devices, namely, the vacuum spark and the plasma focus
(Sect. 4.6.2).
5 Long after the thermal plasma X ray burst, streak photographs show the Bennett-pinched exp-
loded wire plasmas converging onto the centrally conﬁned plasma because of the Biot-Savart at-
traction. The pinhole camera placed in front of the anode records a single “dot” of X rays.

6.5 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Synchrotron Processes
6.5.1 Simulated Z Pinches
Since Iz is often driven by a potential difference across a plasma column, an axial
ﬁeld component E0 = ˆzEz may be present. Chapter 5 dealt with naturally occurring
magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁelds in current columns or ﬁlaments. Because of
E0, the formulation given in the previous sections must be modiﬁed to include the
acceleration of electrons parallel to B0. For this case ˙β = ˙β⊥+ ˙β||, β × ˙β ̸= 0, (cf.
Eqs. (6.29) and (6.52)) and the equation of motion Eq. (1.5) is
dp
dt = e(E0 + v× B0)
(6.97)
Because of the added complexity to the analysis of Sects. 6.1–6.5, and because of
geometrical complexities (Sect. 6.5.2), we choose instead to “brute-force” a solution
via three-dimensional (three spatial dimensions), fully-electromagnetic (static and
radiation ﬁelds), particle-in-cell simulations (Chap.10).

6.5.2 Synchrotron Bursts from Simulated Z Pinches
An enhancement of radiated power equation (6.29) or Eq.(6.52) is achieved when
the sum of the v × B radial forces seen by the relativistic electrons is increased, as
is the case when the azimuthal magnetic ﬁelds of neighboring pinches are present
(Fig. 3.13). Whenever the attractive force between simulation columns causes their
separation to be reduced to a distance such that the repulsive force equation (3.26)
starts to become comparable to the attractive force equation (3.13), a burst in the
radiation occurs (Fig. 6.25). For the parameters used in these simulations, this dis-
tance is of the order of several pinch radii. As shown in Fig. 6.25, the radiation
from the kiloelectronvolt particles is polarized in the transverse plane and the syn-
chrotron enhancement (burst) is detected in the x and y electric radiation energies
(WERx,WERy) and the z magnetic radiation energy (WBRz). The burst lasts until the
induced axial magnetostatic energy WBz, due to the azimuthal current Iφ, is depleted
(because the counterparallel azimuthal current force equation (3.26) brakes the azi-
muthal electron ﬂow in both ﬁlaments). For some simulation parameters, WBz can
build-up and discharge again in the form of additional bursts of synchrotron radia-
tion. The long-time, slowly varying increase in radiation in WERx and WERy is due
to the buildup of electrostatic energy from charge separation in the particle number
and size constrained simulation model.
The total power emitted as synchrotron radiation during the burst (simulation
time T ∼90) is
PT = W T

(6.98)
where W T
rad is the total radiated power in arbitrary energy units (AEU) and τburst
is the burst duration in simulation time steps. Equation (6.98) may be converted to
watts by scaling the simulation magnetostatic energy in AEU to a physical magneto-
static ﬁeld in Tesla (the spatial dimensions and time in seconds are known quantities
in a simulation):

For this case, W T

radiation burst lasts ∼20dt′ in the compressed simulation time frame (Sect. 10.6.3).
Since time compression is achieved by using light ions, mi/me = 16, the actual burst

6.5.3 Synchrotron Source Radiation Patterns
When β|| > β⊥, interacting Z pinches beam a double-lobed radiation pattern in a
direction close to B0. The basic shape is shown in Figs. 3.13–3.17, which depict
the magnetic isobars that conﬁne the radiating electrons within the ﬁlaments.
The isobars during the peak of the microwave burst are shown in Fig. 6.26a. Because
of the Biot-Savart forces between ﬁlaments, the currents in each ﬁlament have taken
on aC-shaped cross-section from their original circular cross-sections. The most int-
ense currents are conﬁned to narrow regions within the C-shaped lobes. These are
shown as spots in Fig. 6.26a, which are found to be diagonally juxtapositioned in the
two lobes. This juxtaposition marks the start of the rotation of ﬁlaments (Fig. 3.14).

6 Synchrotron Radiation
The two lobes represent regions of strong synchrotron emission while the radia-
tion is most intense from the spots within the lobes.
Examples of isophotes of the generated electric ﬁeld strength (squared) over
a time span which includes the microwave burst are shown in Fig. 6.27a. These
isophotes show where the acceleration ﬁelds are strongest, and therefore depict the
radiation patterns of the forward-beamed synchrotron emission (cf. Eq. (6.58)). As
shown, the isophotes tend to be more complex than the isophotes and often show
additional ﬁlamentation in each radiating lobe. At early times, before and during
the microwave burst, the acceleration ﬁelds tend to be strongest at the outer edges
of the lobes. At later times, maxima migrate inward within the ﬁlaments, eventually
producing a “butterﬂy” like radiation pattern. The fourth frame of Fig. 6.27 shows
the vectors B overlaid on , giving information on the polarization properties of the
radiation from the ﬁlaments. In general, the B vectors are maximum where they lie
transverse to |E|2.
6.6 Synchrotron Radiation from Cosmic Sources
6.6.1 Gross Radio Properties of Galaxies
Most cosmological objects, including galaxies, are emitters of synchrotron radia-
tion, over a relatively wide band encompassing radio frequencies through optical
frequencies. The radio power L of galaxies, integrated from 10 MHz to 100 GHz,
ranges from about 1030 W to about 1038 W, and relative to their optical luminosity,
from less than 10−6 to about 1 (Perola 1981). The distribution in power is described
by means of the Radio Luminosity Function (RLF) which represents the number of
radio emitting galaxies per unit volume as a function of the monochromatic power
at a certain frequency. Figure 6.28 illustrates the RLF at 1.4 GHz at the present cos-
mological epoch, the “local” RLF.
The RLF suggests a continuity in the morphological types of radioemitting galax-
ies. Above 1026 W/Hz, the main contribution comes from quasars and classical dou-
ble radio galaxies. In the region 1023–1026 W/Hz, the elliptical galaxies dominate
while below 1023 W/Hz (about an order of magnitude greater than the power of our
Galaxy) the power comes principally from spiral galaxies.
In the region 1021–1023 W/Hz, an overlap of spiral and elliptical galaxies occurs.
The “ellipticals” are in fact a hybrid class, containing bona ﬁde ellipticals along
with N galaxies (a bright nucleus surrounded by a faint nebulosity) to that of cD
galaxies (giant ellipticals with very extended radio “halos”). Noteworthy in Fig. 6.28
is a “break” in synchrotron power from ellipticals at 1024.5 W/Hz and another at
1021.3 W/Hz for spirals.
The size of the radioemitting regions in galaxies spans a very wide range. At
powers larger than about 1023 W/Hz at 1.4 GHz the radio emission is generally dom-
inated by an extended component, whose size goes from tens of kiloparsecs (e.g.,

Fig. 6.26 (a) Magnetic energy isobars B2 in the plane perpendicular to the axial ﬁeld-aligned
currents at time of peak burst of synchrotron radiation. The most intense ﬁelds are the “hot spots”
in the radiation lobes. A B2 minima exists between the two outﬂowing currents. (b) Isophotal
contours of synchrotron radiation at 150 MHz from Cyg A. An elliptical galaxy is situated midway
between the two radio lobes
Cygnus A) to tens of megaparsecs (e.g., 3C236). Often a very compact central radio
component is present, whose power ranges from 1022 up to 1025 W/Hz, and which
may be seen to vary with time. Extended and central radio components are typically
found also in quasars.
At powers less than about 1023 W/Hz, the size of the radio region in elliptical
galaxies is generally measured in kiloparsecs and often reduces to a compact central
component. In spiral galaxies, the next stage of a suggested epochological sequence
in Fig. 6.28, the situation is different. Apart from the radical change in morphology
between elliptical and spiral, the spiral galaxies not only have a compact nuclear
component (of radio dimension between 0.1 and 1 kpc) but also a component of
size ∼10 kpc, coincident with the spiral disk.
Overlapping the powerful radio ellipticals (with Seyfert-like nuclear spectra) and
spiral galaxies are the Seyfert-spirals themselves, comprising 1 % of all spiral types.
In contrast to the ellipticals, spiral galaxies rarely have compact nuclear sources and
are unassociated with extended radio lobes. Table 6.1 delineates the properties of
galactic radio sources.
Figure 6.29 shows the positions of the radio sources, both extended and compact
on a linear-size, radio-luminosity plot. As seen, the bulk of the classical double
radio galaxies possessing an elliptical galaxy have a spatial extent between a few

tens of kiloparsecs to many hundreds of kiloparsecs, with radio luminosities of L ∼
1035–1039 W. Some transitional radiogalaxies, 8–80kpc, and L ∼1034 W, are also
present. The radioquasars appear in two distinct populations; extended sources with
dimensions of several kiloparsecs to several hundreds of kiloparsecs (L ∼1037–
1039 W), and compact sources ∼2–8 parsecs (L ∼1037–1039 W). Most of the spiral
galaxies are found to be clustered according to a size-luminosity of ∼10–80kpc,
and L ∼1031–1032.5 W.
Finally, unlike their other properties, the radio spectra of the spiral galaxies are
similar to those of the radio galaxies. The nuclear component of our galaxy, for
example, is a miniature replication of a classic double radio galaxy (Fig. 3.23).
6.6.2 Double Radio Galaxies
The discovery of discrete radio sources dates back to the pioneering survey of
Reber (1944), who found areas of enhanced radio intensity in the constellations
Cygnus and Cassiopeia. Many excellent reviews of double radio sources are avail-
able in the literature (Shklovsky 1960; Pacholczyk 1977; Miley 1980; Perola 1981),
as are a number of models of sources. However, regardless of whatever ingredients
are postulated as necessary in models used to “explain” their existence, what is obs-
erved from any radio source is synchrotron radiation, that requires only relativistic
electrons in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.
One of the ﬁrst low-resolution radio maps made of a radio galaxy was the strong
source Fornax A (Fig. 6.30). The pattern depicted in this ﬁgure is that of two radio
emitting regions (thus giving “double” radio galaxies their name) situated on either
side of an elliptical galaxy (NGC 1316). Improvements in radio telescope technol-
ogy led to higher resolution maps such as that of Cygnus A shown in Fig. 6.26b.
Cygnus A, the brightest radio source in Cygnus, has proved to be the “prototype” of
double radio galaxies and models of double radio galaxies are usually based on the
characteristics of this source. As shown in Fig. 6.26, Cygnus A consists primarily of
two radio lobes of dimension l ∼= w ∼= 35 kpc (1021 m) separated on either side of an
elliptical galaxy by a distance a ∼= 80 kpc (1.22×1021 m). Cygnus A is thought to be
characterized by the parameters B×10−9−10−7 T (10−5−10−3 G), T ∼1–10 keV,
ne ∼102–104 m−3 (10−4 −10−2 cm−3), L ∼1.6–4.4 × 1037 W, with a total source
energy of 1050–1057 J. The average energy of the relativistic electrons is estimated
to be 100–158Mev (Perola 1981).
Example 6.3. Double radio galaxy simulation model and parameters. To simu-
late a radio galaxy, the results of Sect. 6.6.2 are used and the simulation geometry is
that shown in Fig. 3.12 scaled to double radio galaxy dimensions (the reason for two
ﬁlaments is discussed in Sect. 3.10.6). In analogy to Cygnus A, the two ﬁlaments
are taken to have a width of 35 kpc with a separation of 80 kpc. Assuming that the
total plasma mass M over a length L (∼1021 m) of ﬁlament involved in Biot-Savart
attraction is of the order of that observed in Galaxies, M ∼= 1041 kg, while setting
the velocity between galactic ﬁlaments to 1,000km/s (Peratt and Green 1983) in

(3.49), yields Iz ∼= 2.15 × 1019 A and Bφ = μ0Iz/w ∼= 2.5 × 10−8 T (2.5 × 10−4 G).
(The quantities Iz and Bφ are physically nonsensitive to the actual mass distribution,
depending only on the square-root of the mass per unit length).
To convert simulation results to dimensional form, it is sufﬁcient to ﬁx the value
of one physical quantity (e.g., Bφ). Since we are scaling to the strong radio source
Cygnus A, the value of Bφ is applied at time step 90 in Fig. 6.25, the peak of the syn-
chrotron burst energy. At this time the simulation shows that Bφ has grown compa-
rable in strength to Bz0 so that the pressure ratio has decreased to about βp = 0.0034
from the setup values of Sect. 3.10.1. For Bφ = 2.5 × 10−8 T, the magnetostatic en-
ergy equation (6.99) Wms = 350 AEU = 2.5 × 1053 J, or 1 AEU = 7.1 × 1050 J.
Counting and plotting the thermal velocities of the electrons at time T = 90
shows a Maxwellian velocity distribution with a corresponding temperature T⊥≈
2.8 keV. Substituting βp,T⊥, and B into Eq.(8.20) yields a mean plasma density
ne = 1.79 × 103 m−3 (1.7 × 10−3 cm−3). Since ωc0/ωp = 1.5 (Sect. 3.10.1), the
axial magnetic ﬁeld strength is Bz0 = 2.0 × 10−8 T (2.0 × 10−4 G). These param-
eter values characterize Cygnus A and are in close agreement with many previous

ola 1977)
estimates using independent means. Additionally, from the simulation parameter
EzO/BzO = 0.002c, the acceleration ﬁeld within a ﬁlament is EzO = 12 mV/m.
To scale the simulation spatial and temporal setup dimensions, Δ = 4λD =
2.97 × 104 m and dt = (4ωp)−1 = 1.04 × 10−4 s, to Cygnus A requires a size/time
multiplication factor equation (10.21) of α = 5.6 × 1015, so that 3Δ′ = 35 kpc.
Hence, Δ′ = αΔ = 1.66 × 1020 m and dt′ = αdt = 5.87 × 1011 s are the galactic
equivalent cell and time step, respectively.
Example 6.4. Radiated power from a simulated double radio galaxy. An es-
timate of the total power emitted as synchrotron radiation follows directly from
the results of Sect. 6.6.2. From Fig. 3.15, Bφ is seen to be largely constrained to
the volume of the plasma ﬁlaments so that Vp ∼(1021m)3 = 1063 m3. Substituting
Bφ,Vp, and dt′ into Eq. (6.101) gives a total power emitted in synchrotron radiation
of 1.16 × 1037 W, which is to be compared with the radio luminosity of Cyg A of
1.6−4.4×1037 W. Table 6.2 compares the simulation and estimated parameters for
Cyg A. The agreement between the model predictions and the estimated parameters
are generally quite good. For comparison purposes, the synchrotron isophotes of
several radio galaxies and quasars are arrayed against their simulation counterparts
in Fig. 6.27.

Example 6.5. Synchrotron spectrum. The total kinetic energy of the electrons
during burst is WKE = 8.78 × 104 AEU = 6.26 × 1055 J. The total number of elec-
trons is N = neVp = 1.79 × 1066, so that the average kinetic energy per electron is
¯W = 218 MeV (1 J = 6.242 × 1018 eV).
The most probable energy associated with the electron energy distribution is
W0 = 2/3 ¯W = 145 MeV and, based upon the velocity distribution of the simula-
tion superparticles, the electron energies range from 20.3 to 406.5 MeV (Peratt and
Green 1983). The critical frequencies associated with these energy bounds equa-
tion (6.71) are 1.35 and 541 MHz, respectively. The total incoherent spectrum fol-
lows from Eq. (6.72) and is shown in Fig. 6.31 (solid line). This curve is a superpo-
sition of the individual electron spectra and includes the contribution of each spectra
to ten times its critical frequency.
This spectrum may be directly compared to the spectrum of Cygnus A as com-
piled from a number of independent ﬂux-frequency measurements as shown in
Fig. 6.31 (crosses). Beyond 1 GHz, the fall-off on the simulation spectrum is due
to the neglect of a smaller number of higher energy, run-away, electrons. The run-
away electrons can attain energies as high as 3 × 1017 eV over an axial distance of
10 kpc with a millivolt per meter electric ﬁeld.

6.6.3 “Jets” and Superluminosity
The term jet was ﬁrst used in astrophysics by Curtis (1918) to describe an elongated
optical feature protruding from the core of the elliptical galaxy M87. Later Baade
and Minkowksi (1954) suggested that such a jet might actually correspond to matter
ejection after some active phase of the core. Jets have been mapped in about 200
radio sources. Jets are found not only in double radio galaxies and quasars, but also
in central compact radio sources located in the nucleus of associated (optical) galax-
ies. They are measured from the synchrotron radiation they emit, from centimeter
wavelengths to X rays. However, in spite of improved resolution and statistics of
observations, deﬁnitive direct evidence that ordered streaming motions are present
in jets or radiosources is still missing. Moreover, uncertainty exists in identifying
structures as either “jets” or “bridges.”

Figure 6.32 shows VLA observations of radio quasars having jets (7 out of 26
quasars in a 966 MHz Jodrell Bank survey) and three quasars with faint jets. The
general morphology is that of a ﬁlamented structure in emission that is connected to
a core located midway between two strong radio lobes.
Comparison of the integrated magnitude of the jet in M87 over the period
1934–1980 shows that the jet is variable and has been fading, more or less uni-
formly, by about 0.8 mag per decade between 1964 and 1980. The data imply that
over the period 1952–1980, the total jet intensity fell by at least 2.5 mag. Compar-
isons of isophotes taken in 1964 and 1979 show no obvious differences in overall
shape, apart from effects of variation and noise. This indicates that the fading has
affected the whole channel uniformly since 1964 (i.e., the “knots” or hot spots in the

jet (Fig. 6.33a–c) have not been seen to move). However, between 1934 and 1956,
knots A and B became signiﬁcantly brighter than C.
At a distance of 11.4 Mpc, the channel length of M87 is 30 arcsec in the plane
of the sky, or 5,400 light years across. For this reason, and because side-on pho-
tographs of charged particle beams display different morphologies, the explanation
of observable jet fading based on side ejected matter models is untenable.
Example 6.6. Simulated emission bridges between radio lobes and core. Plasma
conﬁned in the core and channel connecting one of the current ﬁlaments by magnetic
isobars has been discussed in Sect. 3.10.4. Using the scaling of Example 6.3, the
length of the channel is 9Δ′ = 1.5 × 1021 m (49.8 kpc) while the width varies from
about 0.5 (2.8 kpc) to 2 (11 kpc). At time T = 255 (1.6×1015 s or 51 Myr), the con-
ﬁning ﬁeld Bφ (from Fig. 3.17) is 2 −2.5 × 10−8 T, so that the pressure (Eq.(3.51))
is 2.5 × 10−9 Pa, allowing the conﬁnement of a 109 m−3 (103 cm−3) 2 eV plasma.
The inwards magnetobaric velocity equation (3.52) is 8,990 km/s, about 9 times
faster than the Biot-Savart attraction velocity between synchrotron radiating ﬁla-
ments. Through Eq. (1.1), the time varying Bθ produces an axial Ez ﬁeld within
the plasma, accelerating the electrons in one direction and the ions in the other.
Figure 6.34 shows the induced electric ﬁeld variation at the mid-sections of the two
ﬁlaments (the radio lobes), the core, and within the channel on either side of the core
(Peratt 1986). From top to bottom, the most intense electric ﬁeld activity occurs ear-
lier in the outer ﬁlaments at time T ∼180 −270, then later at time T ∼320 −390
in the core. Whether or not an observer can see synchrotron radiation depends on
his orientation with respect to the polarity of the electric ﬁeld. A positive value for
Ez accelerates electrons in the −z direction, which is also the direction of the gain
pattern equation (6.58). An observer in the +z direction, or out of the gain pattern,
would observe radiation only from the thermal plasma, which may be the case for
some radio quiet quasars.
The rapid spatial variation of the induction ﬁeld, as well as the changing ﬁeld
polarity along the channel, causes an apparent “superluminosity” effect as the ﬁeld
sweeps the channel conﬁned plasma. Figure 6.33d, e shows the simulated plasma
and its magnetic ﬁeld. Rather then being core ejected material, the simulated “jet”
is a sheet electron beam (Sect. 2.7.1) accelerating out of the plane of the page.
6.6.4 Quasars and Active Galaxy Nuclei
Quasars can be delineated into two classes, radio quasars and radio-quiet quasars
(Fig. 6.29). However, there is little to distinguish between a double radio galaxy
and a radio quasar. In a redshift range 0.1–0.5, both are found in equal numbers
with matched radio luminosities and spectral indices. The quasars appear to be
the larger radio sources; with strong cores of ﬂat spectral index; the strongest ra-
dio lobe sources are radio galaxies. Hutchings (1987) ﬁnds that nearly 70 % of
the radio quasars and over 80 % of the radio galaxies are interacting objects, the
median separation being 20 kpc for quasars and 12 kpc for radio galaxies. From

simulations and measurements are shown
this he infers a relative velocity of 1,000km/s (identical to the value determined in
Example 6.3) and deduces an upper limit of 108 year for radio activity (Eq.(6.100)
yields 4 × 106 year). Approximately 30 % of all objects have an elliptical, or a dis-
turbed elliptical galaxy located between the radio lobes; none has spiral. The median
source size for the radio quasars is 104 kpc compared to 60 kpc for radio galaxies.
There is a major difference between the radio quasars and the double radio galax-
ies: Quasars all have strong nuclear cores while radio galaxies all have very weak
cores.
Radio quiet quasars lack the double lobe radio structure but retain the characteris-
tic core signatures: emission lines of hydrogen and other light elements. In addition,
unlike radio quiet quasars, radio quasars often have a compact radio component coi-
nciding with the core. Radio variability is shown by this component, in the same
way as the quasar varies optically. The time-scales of the variability for the optical
and core radio components are of the order of 1 year.
The optical spectra of quasars are similar to those of Seyfert galaxies. Both are
strong infrared emitters, but quasars are intense emitters at X ray and gamma wave-
lengths (Fig. 6.35). For example, NGC 4151 (Fig. 3.27b), the brightest of Seyfert
galaxies, shows strong emission lines of hydrogen, helium, carbon, and magne-
sium. The short wavelength continuum of NGC 4151’s spectrum indicates a tem-
perature of about 3 eV. The variability of the lines and the continuum varies greatly
on time scales from days to months. From the point of view of spectroscopy,
quasars cannot be distinguished from Seyfert galaxies. The continuity in spectra
for a quasar, Seyfert, narrow emission line galaxy, and a normal spiral galaxy is
shown in Fig. 6.36.

Example 6.7. Simulated quasar evolution. Figures 3.15 and 3.19 (morphology
evolution), Fig. 6.25 (temporal characteristic of synchrotron radiation), and Fig. 6.34
(time-space history of the accelerating ﬁeld Ez) allows the study of the morpho-
logical and radiation history of a simulated quasar. At early time (5–10Myr) in
the interaction of two current-carrying ﬁlaments (scaled to the parameters of Ex-
ample 6.3) only synchrotron radiation from the two sources (precisely, the cross-
sections of the interacting ﬁlaments where the double-layer Ez ﬁeld occurs) can be
seen in the gain pattern. At about 20 Myr, the intensity reaches some 1037 W while
diffuse inter-ﬁlament plasma has been collected into the elliptical core and chan-
nel regions. The plasma in the channel can radiate via the synchrotron mechanism
(Example 6.6), albeit a much lower intensity than the outer sources. The thermal
plasma compressed into the core, in analogy to Sect. 6.5.2, might be expected to
also display a two-temperature spectral proﬁle: a continuum and excitation lines of
light elements. After ∼50 Myr, the synchrotron burst era comes to a close with a
fall in the intensity of radiation from the ﬁlament sources. In spite of this, the cur-
rent conducted by the ﬁlaments continues to increase from 2 × 1019 to 4 × 1020 A
(because of the constant Ez). This compresses the plasma in the core and reduces
its dimension from about 50 kpc in extent to 10 kpc or less at much later time. The
heated core plasma is eventually enveloped by the source plasmas which spiral in-
ward to mimic the morphology of a Seyfert galaxy (Fig. 3.27a). The two original

Figure 6.37 plots the luminosity L and magnetic ﬁeld B versus frequency ν in keV
for a number of classes of astrophysical objects having both steady and “burst” emis-
sions. Liang (1989) has pointed out the suggestive trend linking the so-called clas-
sical gamma ray bursters with two other impulsive phenomena, namely, the aurora
from geomagnetic storms (Sect. 2.9.8) and impulsive solar X ray ﬂares (Sect. 5.6.2).
Like the aurora and solar ﬂares, X ray and gamma ray sources are likely to have
their radiative energies supplied by electrical currents (Sect. 6.5).

Chapter 7
Transport of Cosmic Radiation
The theory of electromagnetic radiation was ﬁrst derived by James Clerk Maxwell
in 1873. He showed that both magnetic and electric ﬁelds propagate in space and
the velocity of propagation, from purely magnetic and electrical measurements, was
very nearly 3×108 m/s. Within the limits of experimental error, this was equal to the
velocity of propagation of light. Within 15 years of Maxwell’s discovery, Heinrich
Hertz succeeded in producing electromagnetic radiation at microwave frequencies
by installing a spark gap (an oscillating high-potential arc discharge across two con-
ductors separated by a short gap) at the center of a parabolic metal mirror. While the
induction ﬁeld was signiﬁcant in Hertz’s measurements (1.5 m transmitter-receiver
separations), Gugliemo Marconi succeeded in demonstrating true electromagnetic
energy transport, ﬁrst at separations of 9 m, then 275 m, then 3 km, and then, in 1901,
across the English Channel. Finally, in 1901, Marconi’s transmissions bridged the
Atlantic Ocean–a distance of 3,200km.
Like radiation at optical wavelengths, that can be decomposed into a spectrum
of constituent components (reds to violets) by a prism or grating, radiation at other
wavelengths is also resolvable into a spectrum, another discovery by Hertz who
showed that electromagnetic waves possessed all the properties of light waves–they
could be reﬂected, refracted, focused by a lens, and polarized.
The electromagnetic spectrum corresponds to waves of various frequencies and
wavelengths, related by the equation λ f = c, where c = 3×108 m/s is the free space
velocity of light. In principle, it was found that knowledge of the radiation pattern
recorded by an antenna system, and the distribution of the radiation in a frequency
spectrum, could give precise information about the distant source of the radiation–
its location, size, mechanism, energy, etc.
However, a complication arises when the propagation medium is no longer free
space, but instead is plasma. The plasma may be dilute–such as the interstellar or
intergalactic medium (Chap.1), or it may be dense–for example, pinched plasma
ﬁlaments that may even be the source of the radiation (Sect. 6.5). In both cases

7 Transport of Cosmic Radiation
the properties of the radiation are altered, in the dilute case over long propagation
distances and in the dense case over short propagation distances.1
The ﬁrst complication results from a modiﬁcation of the wavelength-frequency
relation, λ f = c/n, where n is the refractive index of the plasma (Appendix B).
Since n depends on the wave frequency, magnetic ﬁeld strength and orientation,
plasma temperature, plasma constituency, and collision frequency, these parameters
must be taken into account when an attempt is made to unfold the nature of the
distant sources such as those responsible for the spectrum shown in Fig. 1.24.
Additionally, linearity is no longer preserved if the wave ﬁeld E is intense enough
to modify the physical properties of the medium through which it propagates, by
accelerating the plasma electrons and ions which may then collide with neutrals to
heat the medium (e.g., Sect. 1.2.5).
This chapter starts with an outline of the mathematical description of energy
transport in plasma. This is followed by a description of geometrical optics in
radiation transfer–its applications and limitations. Blackbody radiation, the source
function, and Kirchoff’s law are covered for the case of Maxwellian particle veloc-
ity distributions, and the classical deﬁnition of radiation temperature is given. The
absorption of radiation by plasma ﬁlaments, the large-scale random magnetic ﬁeld
approximation, and the generalization of radiation transport to anisotropic velocity
distributions, ﬁnish the chapter.

A power-energy conservation relationship may be developed by expanding the
divergence of the vector product E×H, and using the Maxwell-Hertz-Heaviside curl

1 The discovery that radio waves could “follow” the curvature of the earth caused O. Heaviside
and A. Kennelly to simultaneously suggest, in 1901, the existence of a plasma ionosphere which
would cause the waves to reﬂect or “skip” between the earth and this layer.

By applying the divergence theorem to Eq. (7.2), it is seen that the outward ﬂux

The time-averaged Poynting vector ¯S represents the ﬂux of electromagnetic
energy. The quantity ¯T is the nonelectromagnetic energy ﬂux due to the coherent
motion of the charge carriers. In a cold plasma, where the charge carriers oscillate
about ﬁxed positions, ¯T = 0. In a hot plasma, bodily transport of density, veloc-
ity, and energy ﬂuctuations by the free-streaming particles lead to ﬁnite values for
Ka = (K−K∗)/2i.
The dissipation of energy from the wave enters through the anti-Hermitian part
of the equivalent dielectric tensor . When the medium is not time-dispersive, takes

point of constructive interference occurs where these wavefronts again coincide.
The coinciding wave fronts form an envelope for a second surface, which is called
the ray surface when the medium is nondispersive.
For dispersive media, only the direction of the wave is given correctly by the
construction of Fig. 13.6. One must then consider the constructive interference of
waves not only with different directions, but also with different frequencies, and the
length of the vg vector is changed accordingly.
Example 7.3 Whistler mode propagation through the ionosphere. A famous ex-
ample of group velocity relations in anisotropic dispersive plasma is furnished by
the whistler mode. Whistlers, which were ﬁrst reported in 1919 by H. Barkhausen,
are electromagnetic disturbances initiated by lightning discharges in the upper at-
mosphere, particularly the electromagnetic radiation with frequencies of 300 Hz–
30 KHz. The waves cannot be heard directly but are converted into audible sound
waves of the same frequency by an audioampliﬁer. They are propagated from one
hemisphere to another in the ionosphere and follow the earth’s dipole magnetic ﬁeld
lines. In propagation through the ionosphere the group velocity is proportional to the
square-root of the frequency so that the received signal is a descending tone lasting
a few seconds. We write the index of refraction in the form
n2 = 1 −

The maximum possible value of ξ is found by differentiating Eq.(7.33) with

ξmax = tan−1 2−3/2 = 19◦29
(7.34)
where ξ is the angle between the ray direction and the earth’s dipole magnetic
ﬁeld lines. This angular limitation on the group-velocity direction accounts for the
tendency of whistlers to follow the lines of force of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The
frequency dependence of the group velocity accounts for the whistler’s characteris-
tic descending tone since the higher frequency components of the disturbance arrive
ﬁrst.
An example of a 500 Hz whistler-mode ray path obtained using a ray tracing
program is shown in Fig. 7.4 (Kimura 1966).

7.1.2 Time Rate of Decay of Wave Oscillations
The time-averaged rate of power absorption divided by the time-averaged electro-
magnetic energy density in the waves gives the time rate of decay of the oscillations,
that is,
τ =

¯pE·j
¯wE + ¯wB
−1
(7.35)
An alternate way of expressing the time rate of decay and spatial absorption
of a plane wave is through the complex values of ω (Eq.(7.5)) and k (Eq. (7.6)).
The relaxation time for the oscillations is (−ωi)−1; therefore the relaxation time for
energy is
τ = (−2ωi)−1
(7.36)
Likewise, the spatial damping is (ki)−1; therefore the absorption is
αω = 2ki
(7.37)
However, the absorption coefﬁcient must be corrected to include the direction of
wave propagation k with respect to its group velocity ∂ω/∂k. This correction is
(Fig. 7.2)
αω = 2ki cos(θ −ξ)
(7.38)
7.2 Applications of Geometrical Optics
Geometrical optics assumes that the medium varies slowly with position and the
scale length of the variations is much longer than the wavelength of the radiation
in the medium. The radiation can then be considered as being transported along
bundles of curves or rays (Fig. 7.5). In plasma, the various bundles may belong

268
7 Transport of Cosmic Radiation
to the different characteristic plasma modes of propagation. Nevertheless, unlike
the mode conversion processes described in Appendix B, in geometrical optics the
bundles do not interact with one another.
7.2.1 Basic Principle and Limitations of Geometrical Optics
Consider for a moment a loss-free plasma ( ¯pE·j = 0) under steady state conditions
(ω = 0, ∇↔ik) so that Eq. (7.4) may be expressed as
∇· ¯Fω = 0
(7.39)
Fig. 7.5 Bundles of rays emanating from a small source crossing an element of area da
The quantity Fω is called the spectral ﬂux and consists of both the electromag-
netic ﬂux and the ﬂux of particles
¯Fω + ¯S(ω) = ¯T (ω)
(7.40)
Since Eq. (7.39) is valid for each possible mode supported by the plasma sepa-
rately of any other mode, the ﬂux ¯Fω is the total ﬂux for a single mode.
The problem of ﬂux ﬂow is handled as follows. Let da be a small area in plasma
whose outward normal is along B0. Each element of the source sends through da
a tube of rays, and the central rays of the tubes ﬁll a cone of solid angle dΩ. For
a sufﬁciently small cone angle the ﬂuxes from the individual elements travel es-
sentially in the same direction. If the sources are assumed to radiate incoherently
with respect to one another, the total ﬂux is the scalar sum of the individual ﬂuxes.
The magnitude of this ﬂux is then
dFω · ˆz = dFω cosξ = Iω (s)cosξdΩ
(7.41)

7.2 Applications of Geometrical Optics
269
where Iω is a constant of proportionality.The time-averaged power Pω in the spectral
range dω, crossing the elementary area da and conﬁned to the cone dΩ is
dPω = Iω (s)cosξ dΩ da dω
(7.42)
The scalar quantity Iω is known as the speciﬁc intensity of radiation or, simply,
the intensity. If Iω at a point is independent of direction, the radiation is isotropic.
To obtain the total ﬂux crossing unit area da (Fig. 7.6), Eq. (7.41) must be inte-
grated over 4π steradians:
Fig. 7.6 Vector diagram for radiation ﬂowing across a small area da
Fω =
	
0<ξ<π Iω (s)cosξ dΩ
(7.43)
In radio astronomy the measurement of the ﬂux takes place at a large distance
from the radiating body and, since the body subtends a sufﬁciently small solid angle
at the position of the observer, Eq.(7.43) can be approximated by
Fω =
	
0<ξ<π Iω (s) dΩ
(7.44)
Consider an inﬁnitesimal volume element of the plasma in the form of a pill-
box as shown in Fig. 7.7. A pencil with radiation intensity Iw and solid angle dω1
enters one face at an angle ξ to the normal ˆz. The radiation in the outgoing beam

270
7 Transport of Cosmic Radiation
of intensity Iω + dIω leaves within a solid angle dω2. If the plasma is simple and
slightly inhomogeneous, it causes a bending of the rays, so that ξ1 ̸= ξ2. If the
medium is also loss-free then, in accordance with Eq. (7.42)
(Iω + dIω)cosξ2 dΩ2 da dω −Iω cosξ1 dΩ1 da dω = 0
(7.45)
which is the energy conservation equation for radiation propagating along a bundle
of rays. For a simple plasma, Snell’s law of refraction may be employed which states
nsinξ = constant along the ray
(7.46)
where n is the real part of the refractive index Eq. (B.7). We then ﬁnd that
Fig. 7.7 Radiation entering a small volume of plasma and leaving it after having suffered a small
amount of refraction due to a difference in refractive indices on the two sides of the elementary
pillbox
n2dacosξdΩ = constant
(7.47)
Iω/n2 = constant along the ray
(7.48)
In magnetized, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous plasma, the rigorous solution
of the ray trajectory problem is beset with the same basic difﬁculty of geometrical
optics: the wavelength must be short compared to the distance over which the refrac-
tive index changes appreciably. This requirement is often violated in cosmic plasma,
where transition regions deﬁne abrupt changes in plasma density, temperature, and

7.2 Applications of Geometrical Optics
271
magnetic ﬁeld strength. In addition, plasma wave theory shows that the refractive
index may change rapidly even though the plasma density or magnetic ﬁeld changes
gradually (Fig. B.1).
Example 7.4 Absence of a Brewster’s Angle in anisotropic plasma. Referring to

where ξt is given by Snell’s law sinξi = n(X) sinξt. A relationship between E⊥and

Ey = E⊥. From the vector wave equation (6.70), SEx −iDEy = 0, or

The two unknowns ρ and τ = E⊥are obtained by matching Eqs. (7.49) and (7.50)
to Eqs. (7.53) and (7.54) at the vacuum-plasma interface. We obtain
ρ = cos(ξt + ξi)sin(ξt −ξi)+ i(ω/ωb)[a/(a −1)]sin2 ξt
sin(ξt + ξi)cos(ξt −ξi)+ i(ω/ωb)[a/(a −1)]sin2 ξt

. When ωb = 0, Eq.(7.55) reduces to the well-known

(Slater and Frank 1947). For ωb = 0, we may therefore have ρ = 0 at the “Brewster
angle, but if ωb ̸= 0, Eq. (7.55) shows that ρ never vanishes, so there is no “Brewster
angle” for anisotropic plasma.

7 Transport of Cosmic Radiation
Example 7.5 Absorption due to collisions. Collisional effects such as wave
damping caused by particle interactions can play an important role in the prop-
agation of electromagnetic waves through cosmic plasma (Peter and Peratt 1988).
For example, collisions are particularly important for longitudinal wave propagation
because of their slow group velocity. Collisional processes become important for
the propagation of an extraordinary wave near a resonance. The effect of collisions
can be included in the formulation of Example 7.4 with the frequency replacement
Eq. (7.6) (this is usually carried out in the derivation of the current density j). The
quantity ωi is considered a “collisional frequency” (Kuehl et al. 1970) whose mag-
nitude is determined by the type of particles in collision. With this substitution, the
absorption is
αω = 1 −|ρ|2 −|τ|2
(7.57)
None of the wave conversion, wave matching, or collisional damping carried out
in Examples 7.4 and 7.5 exist in geometrical optics. Nevertheless, in spite of the
inadequacies of the procedure, especially at longer wavelengths, we shall continue
to conﬁne ourselves to applications of geometrical optics.
7.2.2 Equation of Transfer
In the presence of dissipation, Eq. (7.39) takes the form
∇· ¯Fω = ( ¯pE·j)ω
(7.58)
where (pE·j)ω represents the spectral density of (pE·j)t. The effect of dissipa-
tive processes is the appearance of absorption which, in the geometrical optics
formalism, is described by
−αωdsIω cosξdΩ da dω
(7.59)
The pillbox is also a source of radiation. For an emission coefﬁcient jω
Eq. (6.70), the power generated is
jωdscosξdΩ da dω
(7.60)
Summing Eq. (6.70), placing the sum on the right-hand side of Eq. (7.45), and
using Eq. (7.47), leads to the Equation of Transfer2

Equation (7.68) expresses the fact that the intensity is the sum total of the emis-
sion at all interior points, reduced by the factor exp(τω) that allows for the absorp-
tion by the intervening plasma, to which must be added the intensity of radiation
incident on the back side of the plasma, reduced by the absorption in traversing the
plasma.
Fig. 7.8 A ray passing through plasma. The optical depth τω is measured from s0, the point of
emergence of the ray (Stix 1962)
The emission at a given frequency has two characteristic regimes, depending on
the value of the total optical depth τω0:
1. When τω0 ≪1, the radiation seen by the observer suffers negligible absorption
during its passage through the plasma. The plasma is said to be transparent to the
radiation.
2. When τω0 ≫1, then I2 →n2Sω and the intensity depends on the refractive index
and the source function. The plasma is opaque. If the plasma is isotropic and
in thermal equilibrium such that Tr = T, where T is the true temperature of the
radiators, the plasma emits as a black body (Sect. 7.4).
For a plasma of sufﬁciently large optical depth, most of the radiation seen by the
external observer Eq. (7.68) comes from the outer layer of thickness τω ∼1.

7.3 Black Body Radiation

(7.70)
which is plotted for various temperatures T in Fig. 7.9. On integrating Eq. (7.70)
over all frequencies ω (see e.g., Reif (1965, Section A. 11)), and multiplying by 2
to include both polarizations, we obtain Stefan’s law for the total brightness of a
black body

Thus, when the particle distribution is Maxwellian, the source function equals the
vacuum black-body intensity B0 (ω,T). The quantity T refers to the temperature
of the emitting electrons; neither the energy nor the distribution function of any
other species of plasma particles enters into Eq. (7.81). For example, the velocity
distribution of streaming electrons or background (or collectively accelerated ions)
within the plasma may be non-Maxwellian and their mean energy different from the
value 3kT/2. For tenuous plasma n →1 and Eq. (7.81) reduces to what is generally
considered to be the classical form of Kirchoff’s law.
By analogy with vacuum black-body radiation we may write that Sω =

role of the true temperature T of equilibrium radiation. Equating this to Eq. (7.77)

It is noted that Tr is a ﬁctitious temperature and depends on the particle distribu-
tion, the frequency of observation, and the direction of propagation.
7.4.1 Classical Limit of the Emission, Absorption,
and Source Functions
This book is primarily concerned with the classical range of frequencies ¯hω ≪
particle energy, and this limit is applied to the previous equations. We ﬁrst consider
the case in which f(p) is isotropic (i.e., a function only of p2 = p2
x + p2
y + p2
z).
At our low frequencies of interest, we shall use the fact that the energy states of
the particle are closely spaced. Writing that p = p′ + Δ p and using Eq. (6.90) with
the energy conservation equation,
W ′ −W = ¯hω
(7.83)
gives
Δ p = WΔW
c2p
= ¯hωW

terms. It follows that
f

(7.85)
Substitution into Eqs. (6.70), (7.76) and (7.77) gives the desired equations:

(7.87)
This equation was derived by Trubnikov (1958) for n = 1 for the study of cy-
clotron radiation from fusion plasmas. Often, Eqs. (7.86) and (7.87) are expressed
in terms of the distribution of energy rather than through the distribution of momenta
Trubnikov (1961). The two are related as follows:
dN = f (p)4π p2dp = N (W)dW
(7.88)

When f is a Maxwellian distribution, Tr equals the electron temperature T and
Sω is the Rayleigh-Jeans limit of the Planck function.
7.5 Self Absorption by Plasma Filaments
Cosmic plasma is often ﬁlamentary, caused by the electrical currents it conducts.
Since these currents are the source of synchrotron radiation, it is of interest to
determine the absorption caused by the ﬁlaments themselves. The problem at hand
is illustrated in Fig. 7.10. We ﬁrst consider the absorption of a single ﬁlament.
Applying the initial condition Iω = 0 to Eq. (7.68), we obtain

ﬁlament current source. If the plasma electrons in a current ﬁlament are in equi-
librium with a Maxwellian distribution, the absorption coefﬁcient αω is given by

7.6 Large-Scale, Random Magnetic Field Approximation
Magnetic ﬁelds in cosmic plasmas are generally ordered on a global scale,
possessing an overall axis of alignment with components that are delineable into
recognizable metrics, such as toroidal and poloidal. Nevertheless, cosmic mag-
netic ﬁelds often present a tangled, almost random appearance on the size scale of
interest for synchrotron radiation. Figure 1.2 illustrates this situation in Fig. 7.11.
Calculated spectrum of radiation emitted by a plasma with electron temperature
of 30 keV. Self-absorption effects are included. a laboratory plasma where current
ﬁlaments generally ﬂow in a preferred direction but ﬂare, twist, and kink to produce
a total magnetic ﬁeld which, for all practical purposes, is “random.”
In the following analyses, a particularly convenient assumption is that the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines are essentially uniform on a scale length which is large with respect
to the radiating electron gyroradii rL, but randomly distributed on scales which are
small compared to the size of the ﬁlament itself.
Previously we considered the case of a single magnetic ﬁeld orientation
B0 = ˆzB0. For this case the spectral power radiated by relativistic particles was
simply a sum of the different mode polarizations. In a completely random magnetic
ﬁeld, polarization is absent. The spectral power is calculated by averaging the to-
tal spectral power for a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld Eq. (6.70) over all possible
azimuthal and polar (helical-pitch) angles, φ and ϕ, respectively.

7.6.1 Plasma Effects
The inﬂuence of a background plasma on synchrotron emission enters via the re-
fractive index n. Consider, for simplicity, the case of a transverse electromagnetic
wave propagating in an isotropic plasma (Example 7.1), n2 = P = 1−ω2
p/ω2. Since
n is less than unity the phase velocity of the wave is greater than the speed of light.
All γ factors in the synchrotron formulae that are due to retardation effects undergo
the following transformation:

corresponds to highly relativistic of electrons γ0 ≫1. The spectra of Fig. 7.14 for

of plasma effects (cf., Fig. 7.13). This vacuum behavior extends down to a lower

Critical Ionization Effect in Interstellar Clouds
8.1 Critical Ionization Velocity
The concept of a critical ionization velocity (CIV) was ﬁrst introduced by Alfv´en
(1942, 1954) as a component of his theory for the formation of the solar system.
If a neutral gas and magnetized plasma are in relative motion, a rapid ionization of
the neutrals takes place if the kinetic energy of the neutrals relative to the plasma
exceeds the ionization potential eVi of the neutrals. This then deﬁnes a critical
velocity for the neutral mass M
Vcr = (2eVi/M)1/2
(8.1)
above which the CIV ionization will take place. This concept was used by Alfv´en
to explain why the composition of the inner planets differs from that of the outer
planets. The idea was that as neutral gas fell toward the Sun, each species present in
the gas was preferentially ionized according to its critical velocity and hence trapped
by the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld at a particular distance.
8.2 The CIV Process in Laboratory Experiments
The ionization of neutral gas in laboratory experiments (Brenning 1992a,b) veriﬁed
that CIV exists and occurs at a threshold near or slightly above that predicted by
Eq. (8.1). However, it was discovered that the efﬁciency of the ionization derives
often not from the direct collision of ions with neutrals nor with electrons with
neutrals, but rather from a magnetic-ﬁeld-strength independent plasma instability
leading to the transfer of energy from fast ions to background electrons. The resul-
tant distribution function is pseudo-Maxwellian at low energies with a high energy
tail containing electrons of energy that exceeds that of the initial ion energy. It is
the high energy electrons within the tail E > eVi which then ionize the neutrals.
The process for generating an ionizing source of fast electrons begins with one of

8 Critical Ionization Effect in Interstellar Clouds
the most common instabilities in plasma, the two stream instability. The modiﬁed
two stream instability for cold ions and electrons in the linear approximation is an
efﬁcient mechanism leading to fast seed ions in a counterstreaming ﬂow of electrons
and ions, such as those produced in a diode in laboratory plasmas, or in space, from
a double layer derived longitudinal electric ﬁeld, Peratt (1992). For cold ions and
electrons the linear dispersion relation is, from Buneman (1962)
ω2
e sin2Θω2 + ω2
e cos2θ (ω2 −Ω 2
e )+ ω2
i (ω −kVcosΘ)2 = 1
(8.2)
where ωe and ωi are the electron and ion plasma frequencies, respectively, Ωe is the
electron gyrofrequency, k the wave vector, V the beam ion velocity, and Θ the angle
between the wave vector and beam ion velocity. The linear-nonlinear evolution of
the two stream instability was studied with the 2-1/2 dimensional, fully electromag-
netic particle in cell (PIC) code ISIS, Peratt (1995) , even for high electron/ion mass
ratios; e.g. Argon, Peratt and Jones (1986). A maximum in the growth rate is consis-
tent with the theoretical prediction Θ ∼(m/M)1/2 and the electrons respond quite
rapidly to the electric ﬁelds generated by the two-stream instability; with the heating
time of the electrons occurring generally in several tens of inverse plasma frequency
periods. The interplay of collisional versus collective processes in the ionization of
neutrals, including charge exchange and line excitation, has been studied in depth
by McNeil et al. (1990). Three dimensional electromagnetic Monte Carlo PIC simu-
lations of CIV experiments in space have been studied by Wang et al. (1994, Private
communication).
The randomization and heating of the electrons due to CIV has been reported by
Sherman (1973) in laboratory experiments involving cross ﬁeld E×B plasma sheath
acceleration through a neutral gas background such as found in rail guns and plasma
thrusters, Scheuer et al. (1994). Here the CIV effect limits the deuterium, helium,
and argon propellant velocities while the heating adversely affects the electrode
lifetimes.
8.3 The CIV Process in Interstellar Space
While CIV plays an important role in laboratory coaxial gun devices, no agreement
has been reached as to whether CIV exists in the natural space environment, primar-
ily based on the study of ionospheric barium releases, Brenning (1992b). However,
an effective means for producing CIV in interstellar space involves the cross-ﬁeld
equivalent in space called the Marklund convection mechanism (for a review, see
Peratt (1992)). When an electric ﬁeld is present in a plasma and has a component
perpendicular to a magnetic ﬁeld, radial inward convection of the charged particles
is possible. Repeating Eq. (4.20), under the inﬂuence of the E × B force, both the
electrons and ions drift with the velocity,
v = E× B/B2
(8.3)
so that a portion of the plasma moves radially inward, Fig. 8.1.

8.3 The CIV Process in Interstellar Space
291
This mechanism provides a very efﬁcient convection process for the accumulation
of matter from plasma. The material should form as a ﬁlamentary structure about the
twisted ﬂux tubes, the lines of which are commonly referred to as “magnetic ropes”
because of their qualitative pattern. Magnetic ropes should tend to coincide with
material ﬁlaments that have a higher density than the surroundings.
A stationary state occurs when the inward convection of ions and electrons
toward the axis of a ﬁlament is matched by recombination and outward diffusion
of neutralized plasma. The equilibrium density of the ionized component normally
has a maximum at the axis. However, because of the following mechanism, hol-
low cylinders, or modiﬁcations of hollow cylinders of matter, form about the ﬂux
tubes, Fig. 8.1.
Fig. 8.1 Idealized picture of hollow cylinders of matter formed about ﬂux tubes; the physical
distribution is not so smooth
Because of the radiated loss of energy, the ﬁlaments cool and a temperature gra-
dient is associated with the plasma. As the radial transport depends on the ionization
potential of the element, elements with the lowest ionization potentials are brought
closest to the axis. The most abundant elements of cosmical plasma can be divided
into groups of roughly equal ionization potentials as follows: He (24 eV); H, O, N
(13 eV); C, S (11 eV); and Fe, Si, Mg, Na, Ca (5–8 eV). These elements can be
expected to form hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential.
Helium will make up the most widely distributed outer layer; hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen should make up the middle layers, while sodium, calcium, iron, silicon,
and magnesium will make up the inner layers. In the classical Marklund picture, the
production and diffusion of neutral gas is outwards from the plasma ﬁlament. (Note

292
8 Critical Ionization Effect in Interstellar Clouds
that the ﬁrst ionization potential (FIP) is also widely recognized as the determinant
of the relative abundance of the elements in the solar corona with respect to the
photosphere, Schmelz et al. (2012).)
As noted by Peratt and Verschuur (2000), while the magnetic ﬂux tubes them-
selves are not directly observable,1 their existence in the interstellar medium would
require both the presence of ﬁlamentary structures and a signature of the CIV
process. The ﬁrst condition, that the interstellar medium show a ﬁlamentary mor-
phology, was satisﬁed with the discovery of interstellar neutral hydrogen ﬁlaments
from high resolution HI data from radio astronomical observations. This is apparent
in the Atlas of Galactic Neutral Hydrogen maps, known as the Leiden-Dwingeloo
or L-D survey of Hartmann and Burton (1997). Initial analysis of an interstellar
HI ﬁlament using the Carlqvist relation for Bennett pinched cosmic currents dis-
cussed in Chap. 9 suggested such HI ﬁlaments originate from axial electrical cur-
rents Iz ∼1.4 × 1013 A with circumferential magnetic ﬁelds Bφ of the order 5 μG,
Verschuur (1995).
The second criterion, that the CIV phenomenon be manifested in interstellar
space, is the thrust of this chapter. The cross-ﬁeld Marklund convection of elec-
trons in the vicinity of a ﬁlament, both in the presence of the background plasma
and neutral gas, initiates the two stream instability as the electrons ﬂow through
the background ions at velocity |vr| = Ez/Bφ, where Ez is the (longitudinal) com-
ponent of the electric ﬁeld within a ﬁlament (often thought to be caused by double
layers produced by a two-stream instability within the axially directed ﬁlament).
Collective ion acceleration (Alfv´en and Wernholm 1952; Faehl and Godfrey 1978)
is caused by the electrons pull on the ions in the convection ﬂow, thus producing
the fast ion beam that imparts its energy on the braking electrons in collisional and
collective action. The ions, as do the neutrals, ﬂow unimpeded by the presence of B.
However, the electrons, deriving both from the background plasma as well as those
newly formed from the neutral gas heated by the high-energy tail of the electron
distribution function, tend to spiral about B.
This imparts a thermal plasma distribution with velocity components in all three
spatial directions to the neutral gas. The basic picture, albeit without the 3D elec-
tron motion explicitly included in the simulation, is the case studied numerically
by Machida and Goertz (1986) who investigated via a one-dimensional electro-
static PIC code the CIV process in high and low neutral particle densities. In
their simulation both ions and neutrals were assumed to cross the magnetic ﬂux
lines transversely while the electrons spiraled around the lines. Included in their
formulation was charge exchange, ion and electron elastic collisions, momentum
coupling, electron impact neutral excitation and ionization, cross-ﬁeld ion beam
dynamics, electrostatic wave excitation, and ﬁnally, electron heating. Machida and
Goertz found that ionization of the neutrals by the fast electrons proceeds effectively
by forming a positive feedback loop until thermal saturation limited by the nonlin-
ear energy budget occurs. It is this thermal signature which manifests itself in HI
linewidth spectra.
1 Archaeological relics from the Mesopotamian city of Ur suggest otherwise (Peratt 2003).

8.4 Neutral Hydrogen Emission Line Data

One attribute, not possible at the time but currently included, are magnetized
ions. This allows a quantitative database whereby particle gyrofrequencies, ioniza-
tion rates, Alfv´en velocity, neutral drift speeds and mean free paths, neutral and
plasma densities, self-consistently are available in the post-processed data. These
are then matched to the inferred currents and ﬁelds estimated from the radiotele-
scope and satellite observations.
Table 8.1 lists the critical ionization velocities for the most abundant interstel-
lar atomic species. They are grouped into Bands and as will be shown below have
distinct HI emission proﬁle line widths associated with them. The most ubiqui-
tous elements in the CIV process in the interstellar medium are Hydrogen and He.
Hydrogen has a critical ionization velocity Vcr of 51.2 km/s. This value infers a
longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ez of about 25 μV/m when the interstellar ﬁlament current
derived by Verschuur (1995) is used. Most of space, being either fully or partially
ionized hydrogenic plasma, is susceptible to the CIV process at this velocity, pro-
vided a magnetic ﬁeld is present, such as that produced by a ﬁeld-aligned current
or magnetic rope. However, observations of neutral hydrogen are unlikely to reveal
the CIV signature of H because most of the relevant hydrogen would be ionized. On
the other hand, the signature of He with a CIV of Vcr ∼34.4 km/s is common in HI
emission line proﬁles, see below.
After the He CIV band I component, the CIV process then cascades towards
ionizing increasingly heavier elements in the neutral background, if these heavy
elements are present. As discussed above, these must be progressively closer to
the axis of a ﬁlamentary ﬂux tube. After CIV band I comes CIV band II with a
mean critical velocity of 13.7 km/s. Finally CIV band III should be observable at a
mean critical velocity of order 6.5 km/s for the common heavy elements. As noted
by Alfv´en, overlap between the individual layers should occur and these can be
expected to crowd the individual thermal lines. Additionally, because of the order-
ing, the HI linewidth spectra must show CIV band I, then band II, followed by band
III. It is important to note from Table 8.1 that all of the common interstellar ele-
ments fall in one of three CIV bands with three delineable HI thermal bandwidths,
component families 1, 2, and 3 (see below), from the thermal saturation mechanism
discussed above. CIV Band III (associate with narrow HI component 3) is unique in
that its region of occurrence must start to coincide with the Marklund pump action
close to a ﬁlament axis and should then be associated with any dusty plasma forming

Neutral hydrogen emission line data can be presented in a variety of ways, each
of which reveals some speciﬁc aspect of the physical processes that give rise to
the emission. In the early days of HI studies (the 1950s and early 1960s) it was

common to report emission proﬁle shapes (spectra) which were then discussed in
broad terms, at best. Figure 8.2 represents an example in an HI proﬁle drawn from
the Leiden-Argentina-Bonn (LAB) HI survey, the most recent incarnation of the L-
D Survey (Hartmann and Burton 1997), in which a Gaussian decomposition reveals
the signatures of each of the main HI component families.
When contour mapping hardware and software came available in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, a new trend emerged. Maps of HI brightness as a function of veloc-
ity and position were published in large numbers. That, in turn, led to the production
of area maps of HI brightness temperature or column density as a function of two
spatial coordinates being published in catalog form. Figure 8.3 shows HI ﬁlament
structure at two velocities in an area of sky that was fully mapped by Verschuur
(2013) using LAB Survey data. These are but two of more than 50 such maps for
this area that shows multiple ﬁlaments that in places interact where they intersect.
Area maps of HI properties such as Figure 8.3 are readily compared to pho-
tographs or other area representations of astronomical data, such as the brightness
of infrared 100 or 60 μ emission from interstellar cirrus dust. These allow extensive

which HI and cirrus dust coexist.
8.5 The Relationship Between Observed HI Emission
and CIV Data
In a number of papers it has been shown that HI Component 1 (He CIV) which
is widespread over the sky has a typical line width of 33 km/s (Verschuur 2013;
Verschuur and Schmelz 2010; Verschuur and Magnani 1994; Verschuur and Peratt
1999), while Component 2 has a velocity line width of approximately 14 km/s,
which appears to be associated with ﬁlaments (Verschuur 2013). In addition,
Component 3 includes narrow features from 4–6 km/s wide, with a mean around
5.8 km/s, usually superimposed on Component 2. The narrow components are sel-
dom found as isolated proﬁles away from the velocity range of the broader features.
In several cases studied closely, Component 3 appears associated with dust and
sometimes molecular structures (see Chap. 9), but this is not always so (Fig. 8.4).
The analysis of the HI structure in directions encompassed by Fig. 8.3 reported
by Verschuur (2013) dealt with the possible association with high-frequency contin-
uum sources. Therefor he did not discuss the signiﬁcance of the apparent association

between the average line widths of 18 families of HI components and CIV values,
although his line width data were summarized in a table. In Fig. 8.3, kindly made
available by Verschuur, the data for major families of line widths are summarized
in histogram form. The presence of the three main bands of CIVs is striking.
In addition, Verschuur and Schmelz (2010) summarized published data from 10
independent sources and found average values for HI Components 1 & 2. Table 8.2
compares their results with the data from Verschuur (2013) with the average values
of the CIVs for the most common interstellar species in those bands are also tabu-
lated. What the data in Table 8.2 show is that the signature of the CIV phenomenon
appears to manifest itself in the motion of HI atoms in interstellar space, a topic that
deserves a great deal more investigation.

Neutral Hydrogen Filaments and Dynamics
of Galactic Bennett Pinches
9.1 Interstellar Filaments
The ﬁlamentary nature of the diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) is apparent
in the Atlas of Galactic Neutral Hydrogen maps, known as the Leiden-Dwingeloo
or L-D survey of Hartmann and Burton (1997). This validates the hypothesis by
Carlqvist and Gahm (1992) that the existence and stability of galactic ﬁlaments is
dependent on large-scale cosmic currents.
Verschuur (1991a) has shown that morphological waves with wavelengths of or-
der 30◦and amplitude ∼1/8λ exist in several HI ﬁlaments in a 540 square degrees
of sky around l = 230◦, b = +40◦. The extent of the longest ﬁlament is greater than
72◦, the limit set by the boundaries of the area surveyed. The motion within the ﬁl-
aments, determined by analysis of velocities along their axes, suggests the presence
of wave patterns with amplitude 5–6 km/s on an angular scale similar to that seen in
the spatial wave-like structure projected on the sky.
In that area of sky, which was fully mapped, every HI cloud is found to be
associated with a ﬁlament and usually found where the ﬁlaments show changes
in the orientation of their axes, as if deﬁning kinks in the ﬁlaments, Verschuur
(1991b). This suggests that a cloud of diffuse interstellar HI, deﬁned by a local-
ized enhancement of HI emission in an area map, may often be a geometric illusion
produced where a segment of ﬁlament twists into the line of sight, in concordance
with that found in very high density plasma experiments and particle-in-cell simu-
lations, Peratt (1992). The name ‘heteromac’ has been given to this geometry, see
Kukushkin and Rantsev-Kartinov (1998, 1999, 2004).
Heteromacs, in space, are the coming together of adjacent ﬁeld aligned currents
known as Birkeland currents and their subsequent coiling into helices. Figure 9.1a,
b are schematics showing current-carrying (Birkeland) ﬁlaments and their evolution
to a heteromac. During intense current bursts that may last several centuries, they are
visible by the white-light synchrotron light they emit, as predicted by the numerical
modeling of the phenomenon. As the giga-amperages subside, the sharpness blurs,
and they appear as a ‘cloud’ to the observer. Their occurrence and reoccurence is

Fig. 9.1 The schematic shows the internal structure of an intense-current (a) and the evolution
of a typical networking of ﬁlaments (b). (Courtesy of V. A. Rantsev-Kartinov, National Research
Center “Kurchatov Institute”, Moscow). (c) An inverted gray-scale image shows the HI brightness
of a segment of an interstellar ﬁlament integrated between the velocity limits of 90 and 80 km/s.
A loop of weak emission is also found between the two bright spots seen at latitude 66 arcdeg and
longitudes 136 and 146 arcdeg
determined by the circuit parameters that determines the ‘sawtooth’ current proﬁle
found in the laboratory and in nature as described by Alfv´en (1981). Figure 9.1c
shows an inverted gray-scale image of the HI brightness of a segment of an inter-
stellar ﬁlament integrated between the velocity limits of −90 and −80 km/s (with
respect to the local standard of rest). This HI feature, found in the L-D Survey
(Hartmann and Burton 1997), is a corkscrew-like segment of a ﬁlament that is here
plotted in such a way as to highlight its nature. A loop of weak HI emission links
the two bright spots referred to in the ﬁgure caption. The overall “corkscrew” shows
remarkable similarities to the structures in Fig. 9.1a, b.
Figure 9.2 shows an example of an HI cloud that lies on a ﬁlament winding its
way through position-velocity phase space. Each frame plots the distribution of the
antenna temperature of the HI emission at the velocity indicated at the lower right of
the frame (in km/s) using data obtained with a 10 ′⌢resolution by Verschuur (1974)
and analyzed by Verschuur (1991b). The lower right frame shows a sketch of the
derived ﬁlamentary patterns. The numbers in this frame indicate the velocity of the
HI emission at various locations along the ﬁlament whose morphology is derived by
reference to the HI structure in the other frames.

Fig. 9.2 Neutral hydrogen maps at various velocities of a small area of the sky around the feature
labelled H0827+10 (shown by the arrows) taken from an area survey. The lower-right frame is a
schematic representation of several ﬁlaments that cross this ﬁeld of view. The numbers indicate
the velocity of the gas a various locations along Filament A. H0827+10 would traditionally be
referred to as a cloud
The bright feature in the center of the various maps is an example of an HI cloud,
this one labelled H0827+10. However it appears that H0827+10 may represent
a direction in which the ﬁlament twists into the line-of-sight. Thus the emission
brightness is enhanced in that direction.

Fig. 9.3 The 100μ ﬂux from cool interstellar dust in the direction of the a region of enhanced
emission called H0827+10, the bright feature at the center of this map. The presence of ﬁlaments,
on this scale, are found where the brightest features correspond to ﬁlament overlap or where the
ﬁlament twists into the line-of-sight (From Verschuur (1994))
If cool interstellar HI and dust are associated, one might obtain a better view
of the ﬁlament geometry by examining the distribution of 100μ emission from the
dust, derived from the IRAS survey of 100μ emission, which has a resolution of a
few arc-seconds, considerably better than most radio telescopes used in the study of
interstellar HI structure. Figure 9.3 shows the 100μ ﬂux from cool interstellar dust
in the direction of the EEF H0827+10 based on IRAS data, from Verschuur (1994).
Emission from the dust associated with H0827+10 is the bright feature at the center
of this map and the structure is seen to have a loop shape.
The Arecibo radio telescope was used to obtain high resolution 4′′ maps of the
HI emission from H0827+10 (Verschuur 1994). The analysis technique involved
the Gaussian decomposition of hundreds of proﬁles in order to identify families of
components. Area maps of each component were made and Fig. 9.4 shows the total
HI column density for the most prominent Gaussian components for comparison
with the dust data in Fig. 9.3.
Comparison of Figs. 9.3 and 9.4 shows a great deal of similarity, certainly within
limits set by the resolution and data display techniques. Noteworthy is the fact that
the HI map shows nearly as much detail as is seen in the 100μ data. Both contain
enhanced ﬁlamentary structure and the original HI cloud may not be a physically
bound, coherent entity at all, but rather follows the principles of a heteromac, where
gravity or a magnetic ﬁeld gathers the plasma into a small, spherically symmetric
volume of space. It seems likely that the enhancement in brightness in the HI data
in Fig. 9.4 is related mainly to line-of-sight geometrical effects while revealing little

Fig. 9.4 This ﬁgure shows the combined HI column density of cool gas (weakly ionized plasma)
found in the brightest Gaussian components deﬁning the emission proﬁles for H0827+10 (From
Verschuur (1994))
about the possible physics involved in creating the structure. It should be noted that
the structure seen in these maps is not two-dimensional but has an unknown depth
component.
Ideally one would want to detect the signature of a magnetic ﬁeld in twisted
segment of an interstellar ﬁlament. In principle, mapping the magnetic ﬁeld in the
direction of an HI cloud using the 21-cm Zeeman effect should provide important
evidence on the nature of a twisted ﬁeld structure. This type of experiment is sensi-
tive to the line-of-sight component of the magnetic ﬁeld and if a cloud is an illusion
produced where a segment of ﬁlament twists into the line-of-sight, the magnetic
ﬁeld should appear stronger in the feature than toward its surroundings in the ﬁla-
ment where it would be more normal to the line-of-sight. While Verschuur (1969)
detected the Zeeman effect signature in several HI clouds seen in absorption, there
are no reliable detections of magnetic ﬁelds in the μG range in diffuse HI emission
anywhere in the sky (Verschuur 1995a,b). This does not mean that they such ﬁelds
do not exist; only that the technology to detect them does not exist yet.
For H0827+10 the Zeeman effect observations did give a value for the limit to the
line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld strength of −0.7 ± 1.0μG (one sigma error) toward the
brightest feature in Fig. 9.4. The average magnetic ﬁeld for ﬁve directions sampled
in H0827+10 is −0.1±0.6μG. This implies an upper limit of ∼2μG. Upper limits

304
9 Neutral Hydrogen Filaments and Dynamics of Galactic Bennett Pinches
of 1.4 μG were also set for two other EEFs, while a third gave 0.6 μ. Small-scale
structure in the magnetic ﬁeld morphology produced by ﬁeld reversals within the
beamwidth of the telescope would not be detected in the Zeeman effect experiment
and could especially hide toroidal magnetic ﬁelds with small angular scales.
9.2 Interstellar Filaments as Tracers of Current Flow
In the context of plasma physics, nearly neutral HI acts as a tracer of the motion and
structure of plasma in interstellar space. Figure 9.5 shows a dramatic HI ﬁlament
that winds its way through a region of enhanced HI emission based on data obtained
with the 9 ′⌢resolution of the Green Bank Telescope, Verschuur (2013b). In the
direction of the bright emission in the map center, the ﬁlament appears severely
twisted. Also, there is evidence for a clear wave-like pattern in the center velocity
along the overall length of the ﬁlament. Superimposed on the ﬁlamentary feature
are several distinct clouds that do not always lie on the ﬁlament itself. In order
to investigate the stability of the ﬁlament, the hypothesis of Carlqvist (1988) was
considered.
Carlqvist (1988) and Carlqvist and Gahm (1992) demonstrated that electric cur-
rents may generate and maintain interstellar ﬁlamentary structure. Key to their dis-
cussion is the theory of a generalized Bennett pinch for a cylindrically symmetric
plasma ﬁlament.
A helical magnetic ﬁeld with a toroidal component Bϕ and an axial component
Bz exists in a ﬁlament with radius a inside which a current I(a) ﬂows. The linear
density in the ﬁlament, N(a), is deﬁned as πa2n, where n is the plasma volume
density, which we will take to be the same as the neutral gas volume density, nH.
The mean mass of the plasma particles is m, which includes neutrals, electrons, ions
and a fraction of helium. For these calculations it is taken to be 2 × 10−24 gm. The
neutral gas is assumed to be coupled to the ionized component (Kahn and Dyson
1964).
From the generalized Bennett (Eq. (2.23)) relationship or the Carlqvist Relation
(Eq. (2.52)), we have for a ﬁlament in rotation,
μ0
8π I2(a)+ 1
2Gm2N2(a) = ΔWk (a)+ ΔWBz + ΔWrot(a)
(9.1)
The ﬁrst two terms on the left of Eq. (9.1) represent the pinching forces due to
the current and gravity. A current I(a) in the ﬁlament generates a toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld Bϕ related
Bϕ(a) = μ0I(a)
2πa
(9.2)

9.2 Interstellar Filaments as Tracers of Current Flow
305
Fig. 9.5 The twisted ﬁlamentary structure of a interstellar HI features known as high-velocity
cloud A0 at the center and lower right of the image, which shows the HI brightness integrated
between velocity limits of −240 and −120 km/s, from Verschuur (2013b) (The data were obtained
with the 9′′ resolution of the Robert Byrd Green Bank Telescope of the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory)
The terms on the right of Eq. (10.1) represent expansive forces, except in the case
where the external gas pressure overcomes internal gas pressure in the ﬁlament. This
follows from the fact that the ﬁrst term on the right represents the excess kinetic
energy in the ﬁlament given by
ΔWk (a) = 2πrpkdr −πa2pk (a)
(9.3)
where
pk(a) = nWkTW
(9.4)
is the kinetic pressure in the warm (here taken to be neutral) gas just outside the
ﬁlament, and
pk = nHkTH
(9.5)
is the gas pressure inside the ﬁlament, whose density and temperature are derived
from the HI data.
Depending on the ﬁlament distance chosen (usually an unknown parameter), the
external gas pressure can be of the order of, or greater than, the internal gas pressure.
The ﬁlament gas density can be derived from the HI observations if the distance to
the ﬁlament is known. There is always a critical value for the (unknown) ﬁlament
distance beyond which the external gas pressure is calculated to be greater than the

306
9 Neutral Hydrogen Filaments and Dynamics of Galactic Bennett Pinches
internal pressure, so that the relative importance of the Bennett pinch in stabilizing
the ﬁlament appears to be reduced. It is more than coincidental that the critical dis-
tance is usually of the order judged to be reasonable for the ﬁlaments, and suggests
a new way to obtain this distance.
The excess rotational energy due to angular velocity ω is given by
Wrot(a) =
a

(9.6)
Interstellar HI ﬁlaments are barely resolved in most current observations so that
rotation about their axes, which would play an important role in deﬁning emission
proﬁle line widths, are difﬁcult to determine unambiguously.
The excess magnetic energy term in Eq. (10.1) Is given by
Wrot(a) =
a

2πr B2
z
2μ0
dr/πa2B2
z(a2)2μ0
(9.7)
where Bz (a) is the axial magnetic ﬁeld just outside the ﬁlament.
Using these equations, Verschuur (1995c) and in a more developed form
(Verschuur 2013b) derived values for the current that would generate a magnetic
ﬁeld necessary to conﬁne a number of interstellar ﬁlaments and those data are
compared to the results of Carlqvist and Gahm (1992) in Table 9.1. Column 1 lists
the ﬁlament property for which parameters are derived by Verschuur (1995c) in
Column 2, in Column 3 for a ﬁlament in Eridanus mapped by Verschuur et al.
(1992) and quoted in Verschuur (1995c), and in Column 4 for ﬁlament A from
Verschuur (1995c). In Column 5 the average values for 9 cuts across the ﬁlament
in high-velocity cloud A0 mapped by Verschuur (2013b) is listed together with,
in Column 6, a single estimate for a segment of ﬁlament shaped like an arc that
exhibits a large rotation about its axis, also from Verschuur (2013b). Column 7
lists the values for molecular cloud L205 mapped by Carlqvist and Gahm (1992).
(In each of the references the authors argue for the choice of certain parameters,
such as distance. In addition, for the ﬁlament encompassing high-velocity cloud
A0, Fig. 9.5, the axial magnetic ﬁeld strength had to be taken into consideration,
and this is included in the calculations summarized in Columns 5 & 6 in Table 9.1.
The axial ﬁeld strength was derived from equating the observed HI emission proﬁle
line width over and above that due to thermal motion, with an Alfv´en velocity that
acts to broaden the emission proﬁles to an observed value of order 22 km/s. The
distribution of component line widths shows no evidence for the CIV signature of
helium of Band II elements (see Chap. 8) but those corresponding to Band II are
prominent.

For the examples of HI ﬁlaments summarized in Table 9.1 the authors argued
that gravity plays no role in controlling equilibrium. Whether or not external pres-
sure or magnetic ﬁelds play a role depends on the distance chosen in evaluating the
equations, but for the distances given in Table 9.1 neither plays a role.
The data in Tables 9.1 show good agreement as regards the values of the key
parameters; the axial current, from 1 to 10×1013 A, and the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
strength, from 5 to 8 μG for the HI ﬁlaments. The analysis suggests conﬁrmation of
the model proposed by Carlqvist (1988) and Carlqvist and Gahm (1992), that the
physics of the generalized Bennett pinch applies to gaseous interstellar ﬁlaments.
This has far-reaching implications for the study of the properties of interstellar mat-
ter. The role of large-scale currents may be very important in deﬁning interstellar
structure.
Diffuse interstellar HI is clearly highly ﬁlamentary. In low-resolution surveys the
pervasiveness of ﬁlaments may often be overlooked by labeling localized enhance-
ments in HI brightness as clouds deﬁned as nearly spherically symmetric, bound
entities, rather than their being due to line-of-sight enhancements where ﬁlaments
twist into the line-of-sight, or they may be a manifestation of heteromacs in inter-
stellar astrophysics. This subject is ripe for further exploration.

Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
10.1 “In-Situ” Observation of Cosmic Plasmas
via Computer Simulation
While it is thinkable that our ability to make in situ measurements can perhaps be
extended to the nearest stars, most of the universe beyond a few parsecs will be
beyond the reach of our spacecraft forever.
From one’s unaided view of the clear night sky, it is tantalizing to believe that
the physics of the universe can be unfolded from the observable stars, which may be
up to kiloparsecs away, or from the fuzzy “nebula” such as the galaxy M31, nearly
a megaparsec away. Our experience in unfolding energetic events in our own solar
system suggests otherwise.
The inability to make in situ observations places a severe constraint on our
ability to understand the universe, even when the full electromagnetic spectrum is
available to us. As outlined in Chap. 1, only after satellites monitored our near-
earth environment and spacecraft discovered and probed the magnetospheres of the
planets, could we begin to get a true picture of the highly-energetic processes occur-
ring everywhere in the solar system. These processes included large-scale magnetic-
ﬁeld-aligned currents and electric ﬁelds and their role in the transport of energy over
large distances. The magnetospheres of the planets are invisible in the visual octave
(400–800nm) and from earth cannot even be positively identiﬁed in the X ray and
gamma ray regions, which cover 10 times as many octaves and have more than
1,000 times the bandwidth as the visual octave. Only in the low frequency radio
region is there a hint of the presence of quasi-static electric ﬁelds which accelerate
charged particles in the magnetospheres of the planets.
As the properties of plasma immediately beyond the range of spacecraft are
thought not to change, it must be expected that plasma sources of energy and the
transport of that energy via ﬁeld-aligned currents exist at even larger scales than
that found in the solar system. How then are we to identify these mechanisms in the
distant universe?

10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
The advent of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of cosmic plasmas on large
computer systems ushered in an era whereby in situ observation in distant or
inaccessible plasma regions is possible. While the ﬁrst simulations were simple,
with many physics issues limited by constraints in computer speed and memory, it
is now possible to study the full three-dimensional, fully-electromagnetic evolution
of magnetized plasma over a very large range of sizes. In addition, PIC simulations
have matured enough to contain Monte Carlo collisional scattering and energy loss
treatments, conductor surfaces, dielectric regions, space-charge-limited emission
from surfaces and regions, and electromagnetic wave launchers. Since a simula-
tion involves the motion of charge or mass particles according to electromagnetic or
gravitational forces, all in situ information is available to the simulationist.
If the simulation correctly models the cosmic plasma object under study,
replication of observations over the entire electromagnetic spectrum should be
expected, to the extent that the model contains sufﬁcient temporal and spatial
resolution.
10.2 The History of Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Simulation
After the early success of astronomers in rigorously solving the problem of two
gravitationally interacting bodies it became quite a disappointment that the notori-
ous “probleme de trois corps” could never be solved by elegant, nineteenth century
mathematics.1 Computations were practical (and respectable) only for the evalua-
tion of a series. Finite difference calculus made its way very slowly during the ﬁrst
few decades of this century. St¨ormer struggled hard calculating orbits of charged
particles in the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (not even a self-consistent ﬁeld!) (Størmer
1955).
Strangely, it was a change in physics which brought the next advance: quan-
tum theory changed particle dynamics from ordinary differential equations to partial
differential equations, thus putting ﬁeld and particle dynamics on the same footing.
The combination of Schroedinger’s equation for electron density with Poisson’s
equation for the electric potential results in coupled nonlinear partial differential
equations. As a ﬁrst step, taken in the 1920s, one eliminated the angle variables and
reduced the problem to two nonlinearly coupled ordinary differential equations in
the radial variable.
This meant that an efﬁcient integrating machine or procedure was called for
and D. R. Hartree built his ﬁrst “differential analyzer” from an erector set. It used
a continuously variable gear and with this device Hartree could solve mechan-
ically self-consistent problems dealing with atomic wave functions and atomic
energy levels.
1 The problem of two gravitationally interacting masses was solved when Kepler proved that rel-
ative to the center-of-mass the orbits are ellipses or hyperbolae (i.e., “conic sections”). This is
exact–and elegant! But this elegance is lost when a third body is added. Only approximate meth-
ods exist, all rather ugly. For centuries mathematicians have sought to ﬁnd an elegant solution to
the problem of three gravitationally interacting bodies–without success.

10.2 The History of Electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell Simulation
313
The “magnetron,” a now very familiar microwave generator, had been invented
by Boot, Randall, and Sayers in Birmingham. It was of paramount importance
to Britain’s defense: its high frequencies could not be jammed. The magnetron
(Sect. 1.7.3) is a ﬁne example of “swords into plow-shares.” It is replacing man’s
tradition of many millennia to cook food with incandescent heat.
Initially it was something of a mystery exactly how and why the magnetron
worked and the scientiﬁc staff at the British Admiralty realized that in order to un-
ravel the workings of the magnetron one would have to solve a self-consistent ﬁeld
problem, namely, that of motion of electrons in the electric ﬁeld which the electrons
themselves produce, in addition to the externally applied electric and magnetic
ﬁelds.
Hartree was given the problem and he initiated classical particle simulation by
integrating, numerically, the orbits of a number of particles in a ﬁeld which was
either revised in accordance with the instantaneous charge density at each step, or
only occasionally, in the hope of reaching a steady ﬁeld by iteration. Both one-
and two-dimensional simulations were performed by Hartree and his team: Phyllis
Nicolson, Oscar Buneman, and David Copley (Nash 1991). “Parallel-processing”
was employed by sharing out the several hundred orbits between the three team
members.
Operating as human central processing units (CPUs), the team made a
number of discoveries including the Crank-Nicolson iteration procedure and
the Buneman-Hartree threshold criterion for magnetron operation. The one-
dimensional simulations yielded a steady-state but could not account for magnetron
operation, or for the observed currents which ﬂow across the magnetic barrier. Only
when the technique was taken to two-dimensions did Buneman ﬁnd an instability,
not unlike the Kelvin-Helmholtz in ﬂuid ﬂow. In the transition from one- to two-
dimensional simulation, iterative methods were abandoned (in 1944) and Hartree
changed to the direct Fourier method (Sect. 10.6.1). It turned out that only a few
harmonics were needed for simulation; the fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) was not
yet known. Success came in the numerical observation of the four- and six-wheel
spokes of electrons that rotate in the magnetron exciting the high frequencies in the
resonators.
The numerical simulation by particles of plasma physics began in the 1950s by
Dawson at Princeton and Buneman at Stanford, where various plasma phenomena
were identiﬁed and studied. It should be mentioned that, in the beginning, it was not
at all apparent that the technique developed to study pure electron beam propaga-
tion in microwave devices could be applied to the plasma state of matter. Unlike the
cold electron beam with charges of all one sign, plasmas often consist of thermal
distributions with essentially equal density of charges of opposite sign and greatly
different masses. In studying cold electron beams, a few dozen particles sufﬁced to
reproduce the essence of the experiment. However, in laboratory plasmas one has
scale lengths greater then the Debye length (L ≫λD) and the number of particles
in a Debye cube ND ≡nλ 3
D is much greater than one (ND ≫1). For example, the
earth’s ionosphere has ND ≈104 and the literal simulation of it over its scale length
appears unfeasible. However the general character of plasmas can often be found

314
10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
by studying the collective behavior of collisionless plasmas at wavelengths longer
than the Debye length, λ ≥λD. It was found that another characterization of such a
plasma is that (1) the thermal kinetic energy is much greater than the microscopic
potential energy, and (2) the ratio of collision to plasma frequencies is much less
than one. Both requirements can be met with rather low values of ND (Birdsall and
Langdon 1985). Conditions 1 and 2 may be met for ﬁnite sized particles called
clouds. Clouds occur naturally in simulations which use a spatial grid for interpo-
lation, as well as in simulations which employ spectral methods where the particle
proﬁle (usually gaussian) is speciﬁed in k space.
The term “particle-in-cell” derives from Frank Harlow and his group’s work at
Los Alamos in the 1950s in investigating the ﬂuid nature of matter at high densities
and extreme temperatures. Modern descriptions of the particle-in-cell technique as
related to plasma physics are found in the two texts Computer Simulation Using Par-
ticles (Hockney and Eastwood 1981) and Plasma Physics via Computer Simulation
(Birdsall and Langdon 1985).
10.3 The Laws of Plasma Physics
The challenge of plasma physics is this: We know with certainty the precise and
simple laws of nature that govern the particles and ﬁelds in plasmas, yet we are
unable to deduce from them how a nontrivial plasma conﬁguration will evolve, nor
can we “explain” many of the complicated plasma phenomena which are observed
in the laboratory.
Mathematical manipulation of the laws, and intuitive additional assumptions or
approximations, have been exploited with only partial success, and often the com-
puter has had to be called upon to “ﬁnish the job” in such attempts. The message to
be presented here is that one might try to let the computer take us all the way from
the basic laws to their macroscopic manifestations. Rather than maximizing intu-
ition and shortcuts which might help the computer get there quicker, let us program
the basic laws in their rawest, simplest form and leave all the synthesizing to the
computer. Given a big enough computer, this philosophy would justify itself by the
demonstration that the computer could not only reproduce all the plasma phenom-
ena which have been observed but also all known theoretical results and, of course,
those obtained from more modest simulations on more primitive computers.
In practice, it would be foolish to relinquish theoretical tools, intuition, insight,
and past experience entirely in favor of “brute force” computing. Even given a com-
puter that could handle trillions of particles with a resolution of one in a thousand
for each dimension at reasonable speed, there would still be some “ε” of imperfec-
tion to be checked for, and the pressure to get more results per computing dollar
would motivate physicists back toward a compromise between traditional theory
and highest-power computing.

10.4 Multidimensional Particle-in-Cell Simulation
315
What is suggested here is a start from the far end: suppose we had that
ultracomputer, then how would we do physics with it? And since we haven’t
got that ultracomputer, what can we do as the next best approximation to that ideal?
We begin our approach by stating the laws of plasma physics in more or less the
form which it has been found convenient to program: the equation of motion for the
particles with the Lorentz force Eq. (1.5), and the Maxwell-Hertz-Heaviside laws
for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds Eqs. (1.1)–(1.4).
10.4 Multidimensional Particle-in-Cell Simulation
10.4.1 Sampling Constraints in Multidimensional Particle Codes
The particle-in-cell technique for the analysis of complex phenomena in science has
evolved from 1D through 1 1
2D, 1 2
2D, 2D, 2 1
2D, to 3D particle simulations. While
at ﬁrst one has to face certain limitations of an analytic nature, ultimately the limits
are set by data management problems the resolution of which depends critically on
the available hardware (Karin et al. 1987).
A trivial reason for the increasing difﬁculty of higher dimensional particle simu-
lations is their demand for substantially greater particle numbers. With each added
dimension the number of sampling particles has to be multiplied by a certain factor.
This also applies to “half-dimensions.” It is customary to denote the inclusion
of extra velocity components by referring to them as “half-dimensions.” Typically,
a pure 1D simulation simulates the plasma as rigid sheet particles, all parallel to
the y−z plane, say, and moving in the x direction. It ignores y and z motions of the
planes. A 1 1
2D simulation keeps a record of possible y motions, uniform within each
plane. Then the x-ward Lorentz force in the presence of a z-directed magnetic ﬁeld
can be taken into account, as well as the y-wards Lorentz force due to x motions. In a
1 2
2D simulation, dz/dt would be recorded as well. In a 2 1
2D simulation, x,y,dx/dt,
and dz/dt are tracked (but not z); the particles are rigid straight rods whose motion
along their axis is taken into account. One-and-a-half dimensional and 1 2
2D simula-
tions have recently found application in space plasma work, namely for simulating
the critical ionization phenomenon.
It is reassuring that relatively few samples can often give very good statistics. In
many applications the velocity distributions stay close to maxwellian and a mod-
est factor (typically four) in the sample number may sufﬁce to deal with an added
half-dimension. One exploits the favorable feature of statistics when initializing
thermal velocity distributions: each velocity component is made up as the sum of
four random numbers (each uniformly random in a certain interval). The resulting
distribution (the “four dice curve,” or cubic spline) is almost indistinguishable from
the Gaussian.
However, when incrementing by a full dimension, sampling requirements jump
dramatically. It is easily checked that the statistical potential energy ﬂuctuations in

316
10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
a granular plasma compete with thermal energies when the particles are spaced on
the order of a Debye length apart. Such a plasma would be essentially collision
dominated. One is mostly interested in collective effects, since ﬂuid codes are ad-
equate for collision-dominated phenomena. Obviously, one needs several particles
per Debye length; again, a modest number sufﬁces. Now, most of the interesting
phenomena to be resolved by simulation are on the scale of many Debye lengths
(hundreds or thousands). Therefore, the addition of each full dimension calls for an
increase of the number of particles by, typically, two orders of magnitude. In 1990
a 1D (electrostatic) simulation could barely be squeezed onto a personal computer,
a 2D simulation called for a minicomputer or workstation, and a 3D simulation
needed a supercomputer (Boris et al. 1970; Cashwell et al. 1959).2 For comparison
to 2012 computers, see Fig. 10.1.
10.4.2 Discretization in Time and Space
One-dimensional, 1 1
2D, and 1 2
2D simulations can be done without discretizing in
space. The electrical interaction of sheets is independent of distance and one only
needs to order the sheets to calculate their accelerations. Even if the sheets are of
ﬁnite thickness or if they are “soft” (i.e., they have a smooth density proﬁle across),
only a few operations per sheet are needed to move them one time step. This is an
effort of order N where N is the number of sheets.
However, in all simulations, time must be discretized. By studying the simulation
of a simple 1D problem, namely, electrostatic oscillations in a cold plasma, and by
Fourier transforming one’s numerical procedure in time, one ﬁnds that while a time
step δt = ω−1
p
yields the plasma frequency to 5 % accuracy, for δt > 2ω−1
p
one runs
into an instability.
To get over this severe limitation of the speed of simulation in cases where the
phenomena of interest are much slower than electrostatic oscillations (typically ion
responses), one can either use implicit methods, or one can make one’s ions lighter
than real ions. Much has been learned from simulations with ion-electron mass
ratios as low as 16:1.
The big analytical problems in simulation arise when one advances to two
dimensions. Interactions between rods of charge depend on distance, and the many
remote rods are as important as the few near ones. For N rods, one has to calculate
N2 interactions and N itself might be typically two orders of magnitude larger than
for a 1D simulation.
In order to get back to an effort of order N per step in the particle advance, one
tabulates the ﬁeld over a spatial grid and calculates the self-consistent ﬁeld from a
grid record of the charge and current-densities that each particle contributes.
2 The approximate relationship of supercomputer performance and performance of those in other
catagories can be shown proportionately. If the performance of contemporary supercomputers is
assigned a value of 100, the values in proportion to supercomputers are: minicomputers 0.1–5,
workstation 0.1–1.0, and personal computers 0.001–0.1.

10.4 Multidimensional Particle-in-Cell Simulation
317
The permissible coarseness of the grid mesh becomes a critical issue and the
problem of integrating the ﬁnite difference version (now in both space and time)
of the ﬁeld equation is far from trivial. Fortunately, both these subjects have been
advanced to a state of relative completion and are exhaustively covered in two texts
Computer Simulation Using Particles (Hockney and Eastwood 1981) and Plasma
Physics via Computer Simulation (Birdsall and Langdon 1985).
Fig. 10.1 Supercomputer performance, petaﬂops versus year, 1993–2012
Very brieﬂy and broadly, one can state that the grid should be ﬁne enough to
resolve a Debye length, and that smoothing or ﬁltering of high spatial frequen-
cies should be practiced in order to minimize “aliassing.” This is the stroboscopic
phenomenon of high frequencies parading as low frequencies (long wavelengths).
Many physical instabilities set in preferentially at long wavelengths and can thus be
excited numerically through aliassing. Grid effects can often be studied and checked
in 1D where grids are optional. Smoothing can be achieved by particle shaping (i.e.,
spreading point particles into soft balls with a smooth bell-shaped internal density
proﬁle). Likewise, splines and ﬁnite-element techniques help.
Regarding the ﬁeld update from the charge-current record, fast noniterative
methods for solving Poisson’s equation over an L-by-M mesh have been developed.
These include cyclic reduction in rows and columns, or Fourier transforming in one

318
10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
of the two dimensions (say, that of M). This is an effort to the order LM log2 M.
Two-dimensional simulations go back historically to Hartree who initiated the sim-
ulation of the pure electron plasma which circulates in the magnetron. Hartree; also
pioneered the time-centered update of the particles from Lorentz’s equation (1.5)
dv
dt ± eB
m × v = ±eE
m
(10.1)
using (vnew + vold)/2 in the second (Lorentz) term and solving the linear equation
for vnew explicitly. No limitation of ωbδt = (eB/M)δt arises from this method
except that for large values of ωbδt the phases of the gyromotion are misrepre-
sented. For small ωbδt one gets the same results as with cycloid ﬁtting (Sect. 8.5),
i.e., joining solutions of the type
v⊥= E × B/B2 + gyration at frequency ωb
(10.2)
for the components of the velocity transverse to B. As regards this particle update,
there is no signiﬁcant increase in effort when advancing from 1 1
2 to 2D and 3D.
A further time-step limitation is encountered when one wants to integrate the
full electromagnetic equations over the grid. Because the Maxwell-Hertz-Heaviside
equations (not including Poissons’s) are hyperbolic (i.e., they contain a natural
∂/∂t or “update” term), they can be solved in an effort which is of the order of
magnitude of the number of grid points, LM in the 2D example discussed earlier.
Essentially, one solves the wave equation (B.1). However, this process becomes un-
stable unless one observes the Courant speed limit δt < δx/c in 1D, δt < δx/c
√
2
in 2D, and δt < δx/c
√
3 in 3D for square and cubic meshes of side δx. In many ap-
plications, scales chosen from other considerations are such that c is a large number
and this restriction of δt results in a severe slowdown.
10.4.3 Spectral Methods and Interpolation
The Courant condition can be overcome by doing the entire ﬁeld update in the
transform domain. The Maxwell-Hertz-Heaviside laws for the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds Eqs. (1.1)–(1.4) can be conveniently combined into one equation for the com-
plex ﬁeld vector F = D+iH/c. When Fourier transforming, this equation becomes
dF
dt −ck × F = −j
(10.3)
for the spatial harmonic which goes like (expik · r). This ﬁeld equation is surpris-
ingly similar to that for the particle velocities Eq. (10.1) and has the corresponding
solution for the transverse part of F:
F⊥= j × k/k2 (magnetostatic field)+
circularly polarized wave rotating at angular frequency ck
(10.4)

10.5 Techniques for Solution
319
The time intervals at which one joins successive solutions of this form are dictated
by the rate at which j changes, not by the magnitude of ck.3
To Eq. (10.1) we should add an initial condition, namely, Poisson’s
ik ·Fk = ρk
(10.5)
Fourier transforming all ﬁeldlike quantities has many advantages. For instance,
the longitudinal part of F (which is just D) can be obtained from Poisson’s equation
as kρ/k2. Of course, transforming in two dimensions rather than only one (as in the
fastest Poisson solvers) makes for an effort of the order LM (log2 L+ log2 M). On
the other hand, the ready availability of well-programmed FFTs and the additional
beneﬁts of spectral methods make up for this increase in effort.
In the transform domain one can perform the ﬁltering, the particle shaping, an
optimization for the spline ﬁtting process, and the truncation of the interaction to
be discussed in the section on boundary conditions. One does not have to use any
spatial ﬁnite difference calculus for the ﬁeld equations. However, a grid is still nec-
essary since we have only discrete numerical Fourier transforms between r space
and k space.
This leaves the problem of interpolation in the mesh. By using high-order inter-
polation, one can greatly reduce aliassing and improve accuracy. Quadratic and cu-
bic splines have been used, but this soon becomes expensive.4 Linear interpolation
is most commonly used. Interpolation is also needed when the particles contribute
their charge and current to the r, j arrays.
Linear interpolation is then, in 2D, equivalent to “area weighting.” For 3D, we
have cut down the data look-up (or deposit) effort for linear interpolation by us-
ing a tetrahedral mesh. Each particle references only the four nearest mesh-point
data. The tetrahedra result from drawing the space diagonals into a cubic mesh and
introducing cubic center data. Interpolation of currents must be done twice in each
step of each practice, once at its old position and once at its new position, since the
current is that due to the movement between the two.
10.5 Techniques for Solution
The crucial equations, (10.1) and (10.3), are in the “update” form, ideally suited to
computers which are themselves devices whose function it is to update the state
of their memory continually, albeit not continuously. If the time interval δt be-
tween updates is so chosen that during this interval changes of E and B, as seen
by any particle, can be ignored in Eq. (10.1) and changes of j can be ignored in
Eq. (10.3), each equation can be solved exactly for the entire interval no matter how
long this interval is: The Lorentz equation (10.1) then produces cycloidal motion
3 The wavevector k = π/δx,π

(2)/δx, orπ

(3)/δx, according to the number of dimensions.
4 In a 3D, EM code, cubic splines would require each particle to look up 384 data points to inter-
polate the E and the B that acts on it!

10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
in a plane perpendicular to B, composed of a drift and a gyration Eq. (10.2). This
may be accompanied by free fall parallel to B, generated by a parallel electric ﬁeld
component. Given the initial velocity and position, or given the position and dis-
placement during the preceding time interval, the displacement during any subse-
quent interval, and the new position, can be computed precisely.
10.5.1 Leap-Frogging Particles Against Fields
Fig. 10.2 Leap-frogging particles and ﬁelds: At time n, cycloids with drifts and gyrations due to
En and Bn are ﬁtted through rn and rn−1, to be continued through rn+1. Displacements Δrn+1
determine currents jn+1/2 from which the transverse ﬁelds En, Bn are advanced to En+1, Bn+1.
The longitudinal En+1 is obtained from the rn+1. Then, at time n + 1, new cycloids (dotted) with
drifts and gyrations due to En+1 and Bn+1 are ﬁtted through rn+1 and rn, to be continued through
rn+2, etc
The average value of the ﬁelds E and B for Eq. (10.1) or the current j to be used in
Eq. (10.3) is taken to be the actual value at the middle of the time interval (Fig. 10.2).
Figure 8.2 shows how the updating from average values proceeds at equal intervals
along a time axis. This involves the following:
1. Construct the cycloidal orbit of a particle from tn−1 through tn to tn+1 using the
known mean values of En and Bn at tn (the middle of the interval) and the known
particle positions at tn−1 and tn.
2. This gives the displacement of the particles from tn to tn+1, and their ﬁnal posi-
tions at tn+1.
3. The harmonic jk of the mean current ﬂowing during the last interval is obtained
by summing all the displacements δr with phase factors expik·r given by their
mean positions, times q/δt.

10.5 Techniques for Solution
321
4. The transverse ﬁelds Fk are now advanced by jk Eq. (10.3) from tn to
tn+1(Sect. 8.5.3).
5. The longitudinal ﬁelds Fk are obtained from ρk at tn+1 by summing with the new
positions r at tn+1.
6. The process is repeated from tn through tn+1 and then to tn+2.
Each time interval is covered by two cycloids for each particle, one with drift
and gyrofrequency as given by the ﬁelds at the beginning of the interval, the other
as given by the ﬁelds at the end of the interval. Both cycloids pass through the same
points at the termini (Fig. 8.2).
10.5.2 Particle Advance Algorithm
The time interval δt must be smaller than ∼ω1
p for proper resolution of electrostatic
plasma oscillations, and ωbδt ≤1 to account for synchrotron radiation or for ∇B
drifts. The steps in the solution algorithm are given by Hockney (1966) and Bune-
man (1967). The interpretation and implementation of this as an electric accelera-
tion followed by a magnetic rotation and another acceleration is due to Boris (1970).
The updating of the particle positions and velocities is done using a time-centered
second-order scheme, valid for relativistic particle velocities,

5 E describes half the electric acceleration and the magnitude of B is half the magnetic rotation
angle during the time step.
6 The sequence is mathematically concise when γ = 1. The quantity u is velocity in the sense of
momentum per unit restmass. The relativistic γ is obtained from it as the square root of 1+(u/c)2.
The equation for u3 is executed by ﬁrst dividing B by γ2 and then using “1” in place of γ2. This
accounts for the m rather than m0 in the angle.

This process is equivalent to rotating the deviation from the gyrocenter drift
through the angle 2 arctan(qBδt/2m) –the “cycloid ﬁtting”–combined with
uninhibited electric acceleration along the magnetic ﬁeld. It is second-order and
time reversible.
Since this algorithm now properly accounts for the effects of relativity, parti-
cles are automatically restrained from exceeding the speed of light and need not
be artiﬁcially braked at c. This limit on the distance traveled by a particle during a
single time step plays an important role in particle data management.
10.5.3 Field Advance Algorithm
The advance of the ﬁelds through one time step of arbitrary length (subject to jk =
constant) is mathematically just like that of the particles. According to Eq. (10.4),
Fk consists of a constant component plus a rotating component. The constant part
represents the magnetostatic ﬁeld generated by the currents; the rotating part repre-
sents a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. Again, the advance through any
time interval δt is straightforward. The longitudinal (purely electric) component of
the ﬁeld is updated from the record of ρ at the end of the time step using Eq. (10.5).
We note, so far, we have not invoked ﬁnite difference calculus either in the
space or time domain and, typically, the advance of the ﬁelds from Maxwell-Hertz-
Heaviside’s equations is not restricted by any “Courant condition” (Hockney and
Eastwood 1981, p. 345).7 However, in practice, δt is constrained by the fact that E
and B should not change across the range of the orbit excursions during δt.
Equation (10.3) is used to trace the evolution of the transverse ﬁeld only. The
longitudinal, electrostatic ﬁeld is constructed “from scratch” at the new time, using
the charge density records:
Fe−s
k
= ikρk/k2
(10.9)
The longitudinal ﬁeld, then, need not be held over through the particle move
phase: it can be generated directly by Fourier transforming the charges accumulated
during that phase. The transverse ﬁeld is calculated as follows. A particular solution
is constructed from jk using
Fm−s
k
= k × jk/k2
(10.10)
7 The Courant condition, or Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition is a constraint on the maximum
size of a timestep in a simulation. It results from a numerical diffusion associated with the size of
the spatial mesh (if one is used) in relation to the timestep attempted.

and this is kept on record for the next ﬁeld update.

(10.13)
To calculate F, we must introduce a grid over which ﬁeld values are generated
from the spectrum by FFTs, and we must interpolate the local ﬁeld from the grid
record. Likewise, charge and current harmonics must be built up by interpolation
into a grid and subsequent FFTs.
Having avoided spatial grids and spatial ﬁnite-difference calculus so far, the
introduction of a grid to obtain the electromagnetic ﬁelds from the spectrum Fk
leads to difﬁculties associated with grids: inaccuracies and stroboscopic effects.
These problems are reduced using higher-order interpolation methods (Buneman
et al. 1980).
10.6 Issues in Simulating Cosmic Phenomena
10.6.1 Boundary Conditions
A major problem in space applications is to simulate free-space conditions outside
the computer domain. Complex Fourier methods (with exp(ik · r)) imply periodic
repeats of the computed domain in all dimensions. If the simulation is to represent
phenomena in a rather larger plasma, such repeats are acceptable, but for an isolated
plasma of limited extent they become unrealistic. This problem can be overcome
by keeping a generous empty buffer zone around the domain containing particles
and truncating the interaction between charges beyond a certain radius so that the
nonphysical repeats introduced by the Fourier method cannot inﬂuence the central
plasma. This was ﬁrst applied to gravitational simulations.
The most elusive boundary problem for space plasmas is the radiation condition.
To decide what part of the ﬁeld in the charge-current-free space outside the plasma
is outgoing and what is incoming presents no problem in 1D and the incoming part
can be suppressed.
In 2D the decision is more difﬁcult. It requires information not only in the source-
free boundary layer at any time but also over its past history. It almost seems as if, in
principle, the entire past history is needed for the decision. However, Lindman found

324
10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
that a fairly short history (such as three past time steps) of the boundary sufﬁces for
an algorithm which will suppress all but 1 % of the incoming radiation at all but
the shallowest angles of incidence. However, just carrying an absorption layer in an
outer envelope seems quite successful. This method, due to Green, simply multiplies
the electric and magnetic ﬁeld by a factor which smoothly approaches zero away
from the plasma. A method employing spherical harmonics which should be 100 %
effective has been reported (Buneman 1986; Buneman et al. 1994).
10.6.2 Relativity
A reason for keeping the mass coupled with the velocities in the update steps is
that under relativistic conditions one really updates momenta rather than velocities.
Note, however, that in the qBδt/2m terms one needs m−1 = (m2
0 + p2/c2)−1 where
p = mv. During the rotation, this magnitude of the momentum does not change,
but in the electric acceleration it does. After the full update of momenta, one must
again divide by m in order to get v = δr/δt. In practice, v rather than the momen-
tum is stored for each particle which means that at the beginning of the update one
must calculate m = m0(1 −β 2)−1/2. Thus, there are three separate calls to a recip-
rocal square root in the relativistic advance of each particle. As system supplied
square roots are time consuming and more accurate than needed for particle push-
ing, a Pad´e-type rational ﬁrst approximation, followed by a Newton iteration, is used
instead.
10.6.3 Compression of Time Scales
The number of steps required to simulate a signiﬁcant epoch in the evolution of a
real plasma conﬁguration would be many million, typically, if t has to be of the order
ω−1
p
or ω−1
b . In order to bring this down to the more acceptable range of several
thousand steps, one must compress the time scales. Compressing time scales can be
achieved by (1) decreasing the ions’ rest mass in relation to the electrons’ rest mass,
and (2) increasing temperatures so that typical particle velocities get closer to the
velocity of light.
For an ion (proton) to electron simulation mass ratio of 16, ion gyrofrequencies
ωbi = eB/mi will be high by a factor of 1,836/16 = 115, ion plasma frequencies
ωpi =

niZ2e2/miε0, ion thermal velocities vTi =

kTi/mi, the Alfv´en velocity

B2/μ0nimi, and the relative velocity in Biot-Savart attraction v =
Iz

μ0L/2π ∑mi will be high by factor of

1,836/16 = 10.7.
The exaggeration of temperatures provides one of several motivations for incor-
porating relativity into our codes. Note, incidentally, that even a 10-kV electron, a
temperature typical of many space plasmas, already moves at 1/5 c.

10.6 Issues in Simulating Cosmic Phenomena
325
The exaggeration of “temperatures” of beam or current electrons can also be
achieved by exaggerating the external electric ﬁeld Ez responsible for accelerating
the particles. This technique greatly reduces the number of time steps required to
study a phenomenon such as Birkeland current formation and interaction in cosmic
plasma. Since the current density is proportionalto the electric ﬁeld (i.e., jz = Iz/A =
neevz

nee2/me

Ezt), both the time required for the pinch condition Eq. (1.9) to be
satisﬁed, and the relative velocity between parallel currents (Eq.(3.49)), are linearly
related to Ez.
Of course, when economy necessitates time compression, the time-scales must
be “unfolded” upon simulation completion.
10.6.4 Collisions
Just as in real plasmas, there are encounters between particles and these give rise to
collisional effects which inﬂuence the physics of the model. Since computer models
are limited to some 106 particles whereas a laboratory plasma may have 1018–1020
particles and a galaxy, 1065 particles, each particle in the model is a “superparticle”
representing many plasma electrons or ions. Thus the forces between model par-
ticles are much larger than in a real plasma and the collisional effects are much
greater. Fortunately there is a way to reduce the model collisions to rates compa-
rable with real plasmas. This involves the ﬁnite-size particle method (Okuda and
Birdsall 1970; Langdon and Birdsall 1970).
The 3D codes discussed in this chapter use a gaussian proﬁle for particles. The
shaping is done in k-space. This is achieved by ﬁrst building up ρk and jk for |k| <
kmax (truncation of harmonics at maximum k), as if each computer particle were
a point and then applying a gaussian ﬁlter in k-space (Buneman et al. 1980). The
particle shape is then of the form exp

−r2k2
p/2

, where the particle proﬁle factor
kp is left as a users option: many simulations have used a proﬁle which keeps the
spectrum ﬂat up to a fairly large k and then makes a rapid but smooth slope-off to
zero at some desired kmax.
A limit to the maximum acceptable radius of the ﬁnite-sized particles is set by
the collective properties of the plasma. If the effective radius of a gaussian particle is
increased much beyond the Debye length, it takes over the role of the Debye length,
causing collective effects to be altered.
In simulating a physical system, plasma or gravitating, it is usually sufﬁcient to
determine if the system models a collisionless one over the simulation time span.
Experimental determination of the effective collisional frequency νc in 2D models
closely follows the empirical law (Hockney and Eastwood 1981)

10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
where w is the width of the particle and ND = nλ 2
D is the number of particles in a
Debye square. In 3D simulations, the reduction of nc is achieved, without increasing
ND, by “softening the blow” of collisions–making the particles into fuzzy balls.
Okuda (1972) has calculated values νc/ωp ≈10−3 for gaussian proﬁle particles for
ND of order unity. This value is consistent with most plasmas, in laboratories or
space.
So far we have only considered collisions between particle species that are
charged. However, in weakly ionized plasmas where the number of uncharged par-
ticles may be hundreds or thousands of times more prevalent, it is often the collision
between the massive ions and the massive neutral atoms that cause a redistribution of
energy, and concomitant effects, such as plasma heating. Collisions in weakly ion-
ized plasmas have been successfully treated by melding PIC algorithms with MCC–
Monte Carlo Collision–algorithms (Kwan et al. 1985; Snell et al. 1990; Birdsall
1991).
PIC codes involve deterministic classical mechanics which generally move all
particles simultaneously using the same time step. The only part left to chance is
usually limited to choosing initial velocities and positions and injected velocities.
The objective for highly-ionized space plasma is usually seeking collective effects
due to self and applied ﬁelds. On the other hand, MCC codes are basically proba-
bilistic in nature, seeking mostly collision effects in relatively weak ﬁelds. For ex-
ample, let a given charged particle be known by its kinetic energyWkin and its veloc-
ity relative to some target particles. This information produces a collision frequency
νcoll = ntargetσWkinvrelative and a probability that a collision will occur. This infor-
mation is then used to describe electron collisions with neutrals (elastic scattering,
excitation, and ionization) and ion collisions with neutrals (scattering and charge
exchange).
The method is to use only the time step of the PIC ﬁeld solver and mover, δt,
and then to collide as many particles as is probable P in that δt separately. The
actual fraction of particles in collision is P = 1 −exp(−νcollδt). Note that we have
slipped into treating our computer particles as single electrons, not as superparticles;
the implication is that with a sufﬁcient number of collisions, the resultant scatter in
energy and velocity will resemble that of the single particles.
The end result of current efforts at including collisions in PIC codes due to Monte
Carlo methods is the change in velocities of the particles. Thus, the only change
from a collisionless run is that the particle velocities are varied in a time step. The
last task at the end of a time step is to determine the new (scattered) velocity, and new
particle velocities if ionization occurs (if ionization and/or recombination processes
have been included in the MCC model). Each process is handled separately. Elastic
collisions change the velocity angles of the scattered electrons; charge exchanges
decrease ion energy and change velocity angles; ionizations do these and create an
ion-electron pair, with new velocities. The effect on the neutral gas is not calculated
because the lifetimes of the excited atoms are generally less than a time step.
When recombination rates are high, and if the source of energy to the plasma is
terminated, gravitational effects must soon be included in the particle kinematics.

10.8 Scaling Laws
327
10.7 Gravitation
The transition of plasma into stars involves the formation of dusty plasma
(Appendix C), the sedimentation of the dust into grains, the formation of stelles-
imals, and then the collapse into a stellar state. While the above process appears
amenable to particle simulation, a crude approximation of proceeding directly from
charged particles (actually a cloud of charged particles) to mass particles is made.
The transition of charge particles to mass particles involves the force constant, that
is, the ratio of the coulomb electrostatic force between two charges q separated a
distance r,
Fq (r) =
q2
4πε0r2
(10.14)
to the gravitational force between two masses m separated a distance r,
FG (r) = −Gm2
r2
(10.15)
In the particle algorithm this change is effected by the following:
1. Changing all particles to a single species.
2. Limiting the axial extent of the simulation to be of the order of less than the
extent or the radial dimension (i.e., about the size of the expected double layer
dimension).
3. Setting the axial velocities to zero.
4. Setting the charge-to-mass ratio equal to the negative of the square-root of the
gravitational constant (×4πε0).
This last change produces attractive mass particles via the transformation
ϕG(r) = ϕq(r) in the force equation F = −∇ϕ, where
ϕq (r) = −
q2
4πε0r
(10.16)
and
ϕG (r) = −Gm2
r
(10.17)
are the electrostatic and gravitation potentials, respectively.
10.8 Scaling Laws
The scaling of plasma physics on cosmical and laboratory scales generally involves
estimates of the diffusion in plasma, inertia forces acting on the currents, the Coriolis
force, the gravitational force, the centrifugal force, and the j × B electromagnetic
force (Bostick 1958; Lehnert 1959).

328
10 Particle-in-Cell Simulation of Cosmic Plasma
Speciﬁcation of plasma density, geometry, temperature, magnetic ﬁeld strength,
acceleration ﬁeld, and dimension set the initial conditions for simulation. The
parameters that delineate the physical characteristics of a current-carrying plasma
are the electron drift velocity
βz = vz
c
(10.18)
the plasma thermal velocity
βth = vth
c = (λD/Δ)(ωpδt)
cδt/Δ
(10.19)
and the thermal/magnetic pressure ratio
βp = nekTe + nikTi
B2/2μ0
= (λD/Δ)2 (ωpδt)2 4(1 + Ti/Te)
(cδt/Δ)2 (ωc0/ωp)2
(10.20)
where n is the plasma density, T is the plasma temperature, k is Boltzmann’s con-
stant, and the subscripts e and i denote electron and ion species, respectively. The
parameter δt is the simulation time step, Δ is the cell size, and c is the speed of
light. All dimensions are normalized to Δ and all times are normalized to δt. The
simulation spatial and temporal dimensions can be changed via the transformation
cδt
Δ = cδt′
Δ′ = 1
(10.21)
where Δ′ = αΔ and δt′ = αδt, for the size/time multiplication factor α. The values
of n,T,B, and E remain the same regardless of whether the simulations are scaled
to Δ and δt or to Δ′ and δt′.
One immediate consequence of the rescaling is that, while the dimensionless
simulation parameters remain untouched, the resolution is reduced, that is,
ωδt = ω′δt′
(10.22)
where ω′ = ω/α rad/s is the highest frequency resolvable.
To convert simulation results to dimensional form, it is sufﬁcient to ﬁx the value
of one physical quantity (e.g., Bφ).
10.9 Data Management
The management of data is a contemporary problem only for 3D simulations. Using
a modest factor of 4 in the total particle number for each velocity dimension and
a factor 64 for each spatial dimension, one concludes that 3D simulations ought to
employ some 224, that is, 16 million particles, each requiring six data (x,y,z,u,v,w)
to be recorded (i.e., 100 million data).

Obviously, there is no hope for doing a plausible 3D simulation without (1) intro-
ducing some economies, and (2) storing the particles outside core and calling them
in only small batches.
Similarly, the 643 linear scale range calls for over 1 million ﬁeld data: Fields
cannot reside in core. “Layering” is therefore practiced in 3D codes. In the tridi-
mensional code TRISTAN a grid of 2×1283 points (cubic mesh, plus cube centers)
is used for recording ﬁeld data, and particles are kept ordered into 128 layers. At
present, the number of particles is 4 1/2 million. This is currently being increased
to 50 million. Only two ﬁeld layers are in core at any time, and four charge current
layers (the latter because after moving, particles can have dropped below or risen
above their original layers). Triple buffering is used when the particles of each layer
are passed through core for processing, in batches of about 5,000. Images of the
batches that straddle layer borders are kept in core, for depositing particles that have
dropped or risen. Some sorting of the particles is necessary here.
Fields of the next layer above are brought in when a layer of particles has been
completed and the lowest of the four charge-current layers is put out to disk. These
two moves are accompanied by Fourier transforming within the layer dimensions
(e.g., x and y, when layering is in z, to kx to ky). Filtering of high harmonics at this
stage helps with input/output economy.
When all layers have been processed, the original ﬁeld record on the disks is con-
verted into a charge-current record, indexed in a hybrid manner, namely according
to kx,ky, and z.
At this point, ﬁeld solving can begin, but it will require prior Fourier transforming
in z. The j,r data have to be read back into core, but in different order, from scattered
disk areas. Again, layering must be used, but now according to ky (say). TRISTAN
uses 16 sectors at this point. Fourier transforming cannot begin until all reading
of a sector is complete: Input/output (I/O) cannot be overlapped with computation.
A similar bottleneck occurs after the ﬁeld update when the FFTs in z have to be
completed before the new ﬁelds of a sector can be written to disk.
It is difﬁcult to assess the cost of waiting for I/O completion; this depends
strongly on the operating system. A time step overall (particle plus ﬁeld update)
in TRISTAN in 1990 took about 2 m on a CRAY-1.

Further Developments in Plasma Simulation
11.1 Updates in Three-Dimensional, Electromagnetic
Particle Simulation Models
Driven by increased computer capabilities, the original TRISTAN code (Buneman
et al. 1980; Peratt A.L., TRISTAN user’s manual, Los Alamos National Labora-
tory, Pulsed Energy Applications, X-10, unpublished report, 1984) has been contin-
uously updated to TRISTAN-PRIME. Starting in 1994, its new features (Buneman
1994) are:
1. Updating ﬁelds locally: Poisson’s equation and Fourier transforms have been
eliminated by updating the ﬁelds locally from the curl equations and depositing
the particle currents according to charge-conserving formulas (Villasenor and
Buneman 1992),
2. Radiating boundary conditions are applied to the ﬁelds: Radiating boundary
conditions are applied to the ﬁelds using a ﬁrst order Lindman approximation
(Lindman 1975),
3. Filtering locally done: All gaussian k-space ﬁltering is done locally,
4. Minimizing data paths: Localization makes the code ideally suited to modern
parallel machines which call for minimizing data paths,
5. Modest code versions in Fortran: Code version in Fortran to encourage usage
and fully transportable: modest versions run on workstations.
11.2 Astrophysical Plasma and Plasma Cosmology
In the past, the TRISTAN code has successfully simulated large scale space plasma
phenomena such as the formation of systems of galaxies (Peratt et al. 1980; Peratt
1988, 1990, 1995a,b, 1997, 1998; Peratt et al. 1990; Peter and Peratt 1990; Snell
and Peratt 1995) and addressed the discipline of plasma cosmology (Buneman et al.
1994a).

11 Further Developments in Plasma Simulation
The new version of the code has been applied to the study of the dynamics of
low-β plasma clouds (Neubert et al. 1992), electron-positron plasmas (Zhao et al.
1994a,b and current loop coalescence, Nishikawa et al. 1994, Sakai et al. 1994, Cai
et al. 2003, B¨uchner et al. 2003).
11.3 Advancement in Particle/Field Methodology
As pointed out in Sect. 10.9, data management problems dominate the subject of
3D plasma simulation using particles-in-cell. In the novel computer architectures,
with their high degree of parallelism, data transport becomes an even more impor-
tant issue. Computing efﬁciency depends critically on (topological or physical) data
proximity in the basic procedure of a problem. “Local” algorithms, such as ﬁnite-
difference equations, have preference over “global” algorithms, such as Fourier
transforms (Note that the calculation of each single Fourier harmonic requires the
entire data-base). With this in mind, new 3D plasma codes have been constructed.
In these the particles are advanced just as in Eqs. (10.6)–(10.8), but Maxwell-Hertz-
Heaviside’s equations are integrated locally over a cubic mesh in the form:
1. Change of B-ﬂux through a cell-face = - circulation of E around it.
2. Change of D-ﬂux through a cell-face = circulation of Γ around it – charge ﬂow
through it.
The E−or D data mesh is staggered relative to the B−or Γ−data mesh both in
space and time.
This method has the advantage that these need to be satisﬁed only at the
beginning of a run (where it becomes a triviality of initialization): it is automatically
carried forward in time by consistent determination of the charge ﬂow between cells.
Thus Poisson’s equation does not have to be solved. Poisson’s equation is “global”:
The solution anywhere depends on the data everywhere.
For the simulation of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction the following
boundary conditions were used for the particles: (1) Fresh particles representing
the incoming solar wind (in our test run unmagnetized) are continuously injected
across the yz-plane at x = xmin with a thermal velocity plus a bulk velocity in the
+x direction, (2) thermal solar particle ﬂux is also injected across the sides of our
rectangular computation domain, (3) escaping particles are arrested in a buffer zone
and redistributed there more uniformly by making the zone conducting in order to
simulate their escape to inﬁnity. They are then written off.
For the ﬁelds, boundary conditions were imposed just outside these zones: radia-
tion is prevented from being reﬂected back inward, following Lindman’s ideas 1975.
The lowest order Lindman approximation was found adequate: radiation at glancing
angles was no problem. However, special attention was given to conditions on the
edges of the computational box.
In order to bring naturally disparate time- and space-scales closer together in this
simulation of phenomena dominated by ion inertia and magnetic ﬁeld interaction,

the natural electron mass was raised to 1/16 of the ion mass and the velocity of light
was lowered to twice the incoming solar wind velocity. This means that charge
separation and anomalous resistivity phenomena are accounted for qualitatively
but perhaps not with quantitative certainty. Likewise, radiation related phenomena
(e.g. whistler modes) are covered qualitatively only.
11.4 Simulation Results
The ﬁrst test to explore the solar-wind-magnetosphereinteraction was carried out on
a Cray-YMP at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) using a 105
by 55 by 55 grid with 200,000 electron-ion pairs (Buneman et al. 1992). A second
test was run on a CRAY-2 using a larger 215 by 95 by 95 grid and about 1,000,000
electron-ion pairs for unmagnetized solar wind (Buneman et al. 1994b). Initially,
these ﬁll the entire box uniformly and drift with a velocity vD = 0.5c in the +x
direction that represents the solar wind.
The electron thermal velocity is vth = 0.02c while the magnetic ﬁeld is initially
zero. A circular current generating the dipole magnetic ﬁeld is increased smoothly
from 0 to a maximum value reached at time step 65 and kept constant at that
value for the rest of the simulation. The center of the current loop is located at
(40.5Δ, 27.5Δ, 28Δ) with the current in the xy-plane and the axis in the z-direction.
During initial expansion of the magnetic ﬁeld cavity, a large fraction of the initial
plasma is expelled. The solar wind density is about 0.7 electron-ion pairs per cell,
the mass ratio is mi/me = 16, and ωpeΔt = 0.84.
The purpose of these runs is to investigate the simulation results with the
solar wind with southward or northward interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF).
Figure 11.1 shows the ion density in the center xz-layer containing the dipole center
at time step 785. (Data were recorded at 128 or 256 step intervals and while no fully
steady state was approached, no major change was seen between steps 768 and 1024
(Buneman et al. 1992, 1994b)).1 The ion density is color coded and the magnetic
ﬁeld component in the plane is shown with arrows at every third grid point. The
magnitude of the ﬁeld has been scaled in order to see the ﬁeld direction for weak
ﬁelds. Thus the length of the vectors is not a true representation of the ﬁeld magni-
tude. The plasma is ﬂowing through the simulation domain from left to right (low
to high x-values). In the process the dipolar ﬁeld is compressed at the side facing
the plasma wind and is extended to a long tail on the down-wind side, just as the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld in the solar wind.
Note that in these simulations, the current in the loop creating the dipole, is such
that the orientation of the dipole is opposite to that of the earth’s ﬁeld. Or, the orien-
tation of the plane of representation is different for what has been normally chosen
in modern times, here with the North Pole down and the South Pole up. However,
1 At least numerically, some concern was given to these step interval numbers with respect to the
numerical and experimental data. No correlation was found and the experimental and astrophysical
data instabilities have no connection to the simulation grid and time step parameters.

this orientation is totally consistent with the data in Chaps. 12 and 13 and also with
world, southern-hemisphere, and Antarctic charts apparently deriving from very-
ancient antiquity.
Some particles have entered the cusp regions and, on the down-wind side (night
side), particles have gathered on closed ﬁeld lines in what could be equivalent to the
radiation belt. The particles at the up-wind magnetopause are forming a bow shock.
The temperature of these particles is much elevated from the background tempera-
ture. Also seen up-wind from the magnetopause is what could be a secondshock or
Fig. 11.1 Ion density in the center xz-layer containing the dipole axis. “Relative amplitude” on the
color bar signiﬁes simulation units
a foreshock. The magnitude of both shocks has a minimum at the sub-solar point
and is increasing to a maximum at some distance from the sun-Earth line.
The current density associated with the electron and ion ﬂuxes and the magnetic
ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 11.2. The current density component shown is perpendicular
to the xy plane (Jy), with current into the plane (the positive y direction) colored red
and current out of the plane colored blue. Again, the values are for the center layer
obtaining the dipole axis. The current densities have been determined from the y
component of the particle ﬂuxes at each cell in the layer.
At the upwind, low-latitude magnetopause the current runs in a direction which
cancels the original magnetic ﬁeld on the upwind side, and doubles the ﬁeld at the
downwind side. At the cusp regions the current changes polarity with the magnetic
ﬁeld, as expected. The magnetopause in the tail also has negative Jy, with a positive
Jy in the neutral sheath. The current in the neutral sheath is carried by the very few
particles located here.
The ion density and magnetic ﬁeld in the yz plane are shown in Fig. 11.3. The val-
ues are those of the layer which contains the center of the dipole and the dipole axis.
The direction of the solar wind is out of the plane toward the viewer. Note that the
density is asymmetric, with more ions located at the left side. This is by ions ∇B

11.4 Simulation Results

Fig. 11.2 Current density in the center xz-layer containing the dipole axis. Positive currents ﬂow
into the plane and negative out of the plane
drifting toward this side as they move around the magnetic obstacle. The current
density Jx in the yz containing the dipole axis (not shown), is running in a belt
around the dipole with a polarity that cancels ﬁelds on the outside. This is the origin
of the magnetopause.
Key parameters are shown in Fig. 11.4 as functions of x, for center y and cen-
ter z (sun-earth line). These are the ion density (top panel), the ion thermal pressure
(second panel), the ion dynamic pressure (third panel), the magnetic pressure (fourth
panel), and the ion Larmor radius (bottom panel). The magnetic ﬁeld is small in the
wind and in the tail, and rises to a peak at the location of the dipole center. Upwind,
the increase is quite sudden and corresponds to the magnetopause. Upwind of the
magnetopause, the density is high and some oscillations in the density are present
here. The nature of these oscillations has not yet been investigated. At the magne-
topause the density drops, but recovers and reaches a local maximum at x = 39. This
maximum is associated with cusp particles that have penetrated to the center of the
dipole (there is no planet to stop them). At z = 46 a second maximum is reached
which correspond to the radiation belt – type particles mentioned earlier. Finally,
the density increases slowly with distance in the tail.
The thermal pressure increases dramatically in a region upwind of the magne-
topause. The location of this maximum corresponds to the location of the third of
the three density maxima found upwind. Through the shock, the wind is slowed
down, as seen by combining the plots of density and dynamic pressure. Thus the
structures at the upwind side of the magnetopause bear much resemblance to the
structures of the earth’s bow shock. The ion Larmor radius has large variations with
location, as does the magnetic ﬁeld. In the wind and in the tail (we are in the neutral
sheath) the Larmor radius is of the order of 10–30, with peaks in places where the
magnetic ﬁeld becomes small. The magnetic ﬂuctuations in the tail are caused by
the tail waving like a ﬂag. (In regions of rapidly varying low ﬁeld strength, “Larmor
radius” loses its meaning.)

11 Further Developments in Plasma Simulation
Improvements to the simulation include ﬁner grids (larger array sizes) while
varying the time-dependent IMF’s. Also, tilting the magnetic axis, and including
an inner conducting surface to better simulate ionosphere.
11.4.1 Advances in the Setup of Geometries for Plasmas
in Interstellar Space
One of the features of TRISTAN-PRIME has been its incorporation of mid-
evolution simulation geometries. After decades of PIC simulation on plasma gun
and interstellar evolution together with nearly 10,000 z-pinch experiments on a
wide range of high energy generators, the thought was to simply redo some of these
mid-point in time as veriﬁcations, the new execution time being minutes rather than
months.
That the ﬁrst version of TRISTAN (circa 1982) was both fully three-dimensional
and operable at 100 teraﬂops was due to the genius of O. Buneman and his
colleagues, accomplished by writing the code in machine assembly language, e.g.
CAL, cray assembly language, rather than high-level languages. With regards porta-
bility, this proved very unpopular to the PIC simulation community who almost
universally continued to analyze physical models with two-dimensional codes.2

The new version of TRISTAN had two classes of problems in mind: high power
microwave tubes and space plasmas.
By the 1990s high power microwave generation schemes came to be dom-
inated by reﬂex triodes, vircators, reﬂex klystron oscillators (RKO’s), magnet-
ically insulated transmission line oscillators (MILOs), gyrotrons, and backward
wave oscillators (BWO’s). These devices are characterized by multiple conductors
such as anodes, grids, cathodes, slow wave structures, vanes, and resonant cavities.
Unfortunately, conducting boundaries were not permitted in the original versions of
TRISTAN.

338
11 Further Developments in Plasma Simulation
Nevertheless, TRISTAN remained nearly unused outside of Stanford and Los
Alamos. Its lack of widespread acceptance might be traced, in part, to its sparse
documentation and the obscure user-unfriendly CAL coding as some of its key
algorithms. Nevertheless, a TRISTAN user manual which describes the set up var-
ious beam geometries in CAL and operation on a Cray machine was distributed to
TRISTAN users (Peratt AL, TRISTAN user’s Guide, Los Alamos National Labora-
tory, Pulsed Energy Applications, X-10, unpublished report, 1984).
Only when machine speeds reached multiple-petaﬂop, now exaﬂop speeds, did
three-dimensional simulation become readily adopted in the code community. These
advances were pioneered by the nuclear energy and space plasma community before
reaching the pulse-power analysts.

12.1 Formation and Dynamics of Laboratory Currents
12.1.1 Formation and Evolution of Plasma Currents
One of the outstanding properties of electron beam propagation along an axial mag-
netic ﬁeld is the breakup of the beam into discrete vortex-like current bundles when
a threshold determined by either the beam current or distance of propagation is ex-
ceeded (Buneman et al. 1992; Peratt and Snell 1985; Shishlov et al. 2002; Krejci
et al. 1993; Dessler 1983; Peratt 1992).
The phenomena, when observed closely, resembles that associated with the
Kelvin-Helmholz ﬂuid dynamical shear instability, in which vortices develop
throughout a ﬂuid when a critical velocity in the ﬂow is exceeded, with a large
increase in the resistance to ﬂow (Alfv´en and Carlqvist 1978).1
While structural changes in the azimuthal direction are observed in solid, annu-
lar, or sheet beams, it is with thin-sheath hollow electron beams that the vortexing
phenomenon is most pronounced. Thin plasma hollow beams are naturally produced
and are capable of conducting currents exceeding those given by the characteristic
Alfv´en value (Alfv´en 1981).
For strong magnetic, ﬁeld low density beams, the cross–ﬁeld electron beam pa-
rameter is given by

where ω2
pe = nee2/meγε0, ωce = eB/meγ, and γ =

beam of axial velocity vz.
For strong magnetic ﬁeld low–density beams, q < 1, and for a beam of thickness
Δr, the instability occurs at long wavelengths
λ ≈(π/0.4)Δr

beam evolution is slowed considerably in computational analysis, Chap. 3.

12.1 Formation and Dynamics of Laboratory Currents

12.1.2 Evolution of Field–Aligned Currents
In its simplest, the Biot-Savart Force law states that current ﬁlaments or wires run-
ning in the same direction attract, while those in opposite directions repulse. For
plasmas there is a neutral force region where the ﬁlaments do not merge but rather
start a rotational motion around each other to form a vortex–like geometry. In the
laboratory, this is most often seen for the closest pairs of ﬁlaments but also for three
and more ﬁlaments (Kukushkin et al. 1999).
Figure 12.2 is an artist’s illustration of a hollow relativistic charged-particlebeam
forming individual current ﬁlaments while Fig. 12.3 shows their merging sequence.
Fig. 12.2 Basic characteristic of a very thin plasma sheath of relativistic electrons and ions ﬂowing
along a longitudinal (vertical) magnetic ﬁeld; the sheath ﬁlaments into 56 current ﬁlaments
Figure 12.4 shows the pattern of a 90-kA electron beam from a thin circular
cathode as recorded on a steel witness plate. The periodicity of the beam ﬁlaments
impacts into the steel plate (white dots) is 56. For comparison purposes, a circle of
56 evenly spaced outer hexagonal ﬁducial markers has been superposed onto the
witness plate.
Figure 12.5 shows the pattern created on a witness plate of the oppositely di-
rected ion-beam ﬁlaments. The outer ring, 75 μm in diameter, numbers 28 ﬁlaments.
Slighty inside the outer ring is are 28–33 irregular shaped (likely merging or rotat-
ing) deposits. Far to the center are four ‘posts,’ a “quadrupole struture”.
The behavior and merging of inﬂowing ﬁlaments is shown in Fig. 12.6 shows

the six is shielded by a ﬁlament in front of it) in Biot-Savart attraction. In addition,

to a strong pinch (center) where they twist into a helix structure before untwisting
back into six ﬁlaments (bottom).
A framing camera was used to capture the twisting ﬁlaments at maximum pinch.
The resulting “helix” is shown in Fig. 12.7.

As shown in Fig. 12.8, the most common pairing or tripling, as determined from
a large collection of observations is 56 (by far the most common), 49, 47, 41,

(Mountford 1960). The converging continues through 20, 16, 8, 7, 6, and 4, the latter
being the minimum number of Birkeland currents recorded but in great frequency.
Also important are 112 (2×56) ﬁlaments, the number prior to the merging to 56.
12.2 Dense Plasma Focus (DPF)
The DPF is among the most interesting of high-energy plasma devices. A capacitor
bank, or a highly explosive magnetic-compression generator, is discharged through
two coaxial electrodes, called a plasma gun, forming a plasma current sheath be-
tween the inner and outer electrodes. The j×B force accelerates the sheath outward
to the ends of the electrodes where the inner sheath radius is forced inwards toward
the center electrode forming a columnar pinch or “focus” on axis. The outer sheath,
the “penumbra,” is a chalice of current ﬁlaments (Milanese and Moroso 2005). The
inner electrode is usually the anode.
According to Haines (1981): Many of the earliest experiments in controlled ther-
monuclear fusion research were Z-pinches. However, they were found to be highly
unstable to the m = 0 (sausage) and the m = 1 (kink) MHD instabilities, and to the
m = 0 Rayleigh–Taylor instability.
However, as experimentalists were searching for more stable conﬁgurations, the
plasma focus found other applications other than laboratory fusion and on other
scales. Plasma foci since have been found in the solar system, e.g., on the surface of
Jupiter’s satellite Io (Chap.4).

Studies of the plasma focus, which after 3-D compression on axis, closely resem-
bles a Z-pinch. Diagnostics show that a plasma of density 1025 m−3 and an electron
temperature of 1 keV can be achieved in a narrow ﬁlament a few millimeters in di-
ameter and about a centimeter in length. It sometimes can have enhanced stability
properties which might be attributable to the effect of the ﬁnite ion Larmor radius.
With regard to the DPF, the usual number of ﬁlaments formed in the penumbra
or “chalice” at the pinch is either 56 or 56–paired ﬁlaments. Figure 12.9 shows the
penumbra created at pinch in a 174-kA discharge-current DPF. The periodicity of
this chalice structure is 56. Figure 12.10 is the penumbra created at pinch in a 1.8-
MA discharge-current DPF.
At this higher current, 56 pairs of ﬁlaments are discernable in the open-shutter
photograph. The ﬁgure to the right is an overlay of 56 lines on top of each ﬁlament
pair. Milanese and Moroso (2005), using a low-power 250-kA DPF, report about
60 ﬁlaments recorded by their image converter camera in a series of time-evolution
photographs. Figure 12.11 shows the penumbra of a 250-KA DPF.
12.3 Evolution of Plasma Filaments via the Biot-Savart Force
As an example, Fig. 12.6 shows a streak camera recording whereby a group of
plasma ﬁlaments are open-shutter photographed through a slit aperture focused
across the array. In Fig. 12.6, time increases from top to bottom. At the top, the
photograph shows six ﬁlaments (one of the six is shielded by a ﬁlament in front of
it) in Biot-Savart attraction. In addition, seen in the early stages of the ﬁlaments are
micropinches. The ﬁlaments converge to a strong pinch (center) where they twist
into a helix structure before untwisting back into six ﬁlaments (bottom).
A framing camera was used to capture the twisting ﬁlaments at maximum pinch.
The resulting “helix” is shown in Fig. 12.7.

12.4 Birkeland’s Terrella Experiments
As Professor of Physics at the Royal Frederik University in Kristiania (Oslo), Kris-
tian Birkeland laid foundations for our current understanding of geomagnetism and
polar auroras (Chap.2). In 1901, Birkeland initiated a new set of laboratory sim-
ulations that he called Terrella Experiments.2 His purpose was to prove incontro-
vertibly the correctness of his theoretical interpretation of auroral and geomagnetic
2 Terrella, Latin for “Little Earth”.

disturbances. For the ﬁrst time cosmic phenomena were scaled and simulated in a
laboratory. His terrella experiments were at once simple and ingenious. He fully be-
lieved that the laboratory experiments would conﬁrm his understanding of auroras.
They opened new paths suggesting how electromagnetic forces might operate in the
solar system.
Birkeland’s life (1867–1917) spanned a watershed period in the understanding or
our planet and its environment. Insights about electricity and magnetism, codeﬁed
by Maxwell (Sect. 1.1, page 1) in the mid-ninetieth century, evolved from theoretical
curiosities to become the basis for our electronic technology and eventually what is
now called The Space Age, the understanding of the geospace environment (Egeland
and Burke 2005).
While the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld had been accurately measured, it was not known
if the Sun possessed a magnetic ﬁeld, and the atmosphere and layers around the
Earth were completely hypothetical (Walker 1861).
While many theories existed as to the cause of the Aurora Borealis, the North-
ern Lights so clearly seen on Earth at high latitudes, Birkeland was the ﬁrst to
systematically study them with modern scientiﬁc methodology: hypothesis, mathe-
matical analysis, and ﬁnally measurement and observation with world-wide data.
Under the guidance of Henri Poincar´e, Birkeland turned to the study of
Maxwell’s equations and the motions of charged particles in a magnetic monopole
ﬁeld. To prove that there existed charged particles in space and that these followed
supposed magnetic ﬁelds in space, Birkeland started a series of experiments whose
results he would compare to geophysical observations.
To do so, he constructed in his laboratory, a vacuum chamber (a 1,000 L pumped-
down acquarium) into which he placed a thin brass globe coated with either phos-
phorescent paint or oil in order to observe the electron spatial distributions and
dynamics. An electromagnet was placed within the brass glove to simulate Earth’s
geomagnetic dipole ﬁeld. Within the chamber, the earthed (grounded) globe was
bombarded with cathode rays, electron beams produced by a cathode placed near a
wall of the vacuum chamber.
Given the size and capabilities of his battery bank and electromagnet (to pro-
duce the simulated Earth ﬁeld) and his high-voltage generator (to produce the elec-
trons), his experimental parameters, when scaled, were remarkably close to the what
is observed and measured around Earth today. His diagnostics, eight cameras sur-
rounding the dc driven terrella experiment with concomittant recording screens, are
completely familiar to pulsed energy physicists today who design multi-megajoule
magnetic fusion Z machines (Chap.2) or record underground nuclear detonations.
Altogether, Birkeland constructed 17 terrella’s.3 These ranged in size from
2–70 cm in diameter.
Birkeland’s solar and cosmic phenomena were made at a time when other scien-
tists maintained that the Earth was surrounded by vacuum (Birkeland 1908).4

(1892–1965) and Douglas R Hartree (1897–1958) in Great Britain.

Figure 12.11b is a photograph of Birkeland and his terrella, a magnetized copper
globe. The globe is an anode between two cathode plates in a 320 L vacuum chamber
containing 0.013−0.012 mm Hg. His largest current generator could deliver 300 mA
at 20 kV.
For distances less than that is given in (3), the ﬁlaments are constrained by the
generalized Bennett relation (Buneman et al. 1992), or if rotation is ignored, by
the Bennett relation μ0I2/4π = 2 NkT. Birkeland, using eight cameras and eight
screens, was apparently the ﬁrst to capture the nature of these constrained ﬁlaments,
as shown in Figs. 12.12 and 12.13. Depicted are currents ﬂowing into and out of a
magnetized copper globe along its axis.

screens to map the electron trajectories (Courtesy, A. Egeland)
In his other photographs, the ﬁlaments (surface currents or ionospheric currents)
can be seen running along the surface of the globe.5
As current was increased to the electromagnet within the globe to simulate
the Earth’s magnetic dipolar ﬁeld, the currents were forced toward the poles of
the terrella, eventually satisfying (3) to produce “auroral” rings around each pole.
Densitometer scans across the Bennett-constrained currents in his photographs show
approximately 56 ﬁlaments, many in pairs.
12.5 Birkeland’s Trips to Egypt
Birkeland had done research in Egypt and Sudan in 1910, moving there in 1913
and remaining for nearly 3 years (Egeland and Burke 2005). The purpose reported
was his interest in zodiacal light. There is reason to wonder if other observations
of light in the laboratory raised his interest in this country lying at 30◦N latitude as
compared to Oslo at 70◦N. Birkeland had spent much effort preparing a treatise that
reportedly was nearly as complete as his earlier treatises.
5 A terella is a magnetized sphere in a vacuum chamber; electron beams are shot against the sphere;
residual gas in the chamber makes the path of the beams visible as they are bent by the magnetic
ﬁeld of the sphere.

12.5 Birkeland’s Trips to Egypt
353
Fig. 12.15 Birkeland’s dilemma: how to travel from Cairo to Oslo in 1917 as WWI raged across
Europe and the Ottoman Empire?
Comparison of Figs. 12.15 to 12.12, left and right,6 suggests that Oslo lies near
the Aurora Borealis and that Cairo lies within the atmospheric current region. It
seems plausible that Birkeland, beyond compare in the interest of all things physi-
cal, would have made note of this. He must also have been aware of Walker’s gal-
vanometer “ground–current” measurements of the 1859 event.7
In the spring of 1917, Birkeland decided to return home to Norway to celebrate
his upcoming 50th birthday. However his return trip was made far more complicated
than his 1913 arrival as now WWI was raging in Europe. Birkeland was thus forced
to return by travelling across the Indian Ocean, reaching Tokyo in early May where
he fell ill, dying June 15, 1917 before his 50th birthday.
As detailed by Egeland and Burke, some time after Birkeland’s death word came
that the “Peking” carrying Birkeland’s belongings, including his Egyptian treatise,
was lost off the Korean coast. Thus we might never know what it contained but shall
pursue possibilities in Chap. 13.
6 And taking “north” as “up”.
7 While we have no notes to prove this; supporting evidence is given in Chap. 13.

12.6 Macro–Terrella Experiments
To realistically record a topside Birkeland high-current evolution as viewed from a
‘ground’ level, requires a sophisticated experimental setup of a size reasonable for
cameras viewing 4π2 at the terrella surface (Peratt 1988b).
The need to study high-energy electrons impacting a high-vacuum terella re-
quires more than a tabletop experiment. A relevant experiment would be a terella
lowered down-hole with concomitant viewing enclosure and fast diagnostics, sub-
jected to the ﬂuence of a typical nuclear detonation. This would show current ﬁla-
ments ﬂowing systematically over its surface (U.S. Department of Energy, (1993)
Announced United States Nuclear Tests, DOE/NV-209, UC-700, pp. 1–104). How-
ever, cessation of nuclear testing between the United States and Russia in 1993 now
precludes this area of research.
12.7 Properties of a Strong Aurora
An estimate for the currents in a strong aurora can be obtained from Alfv´en and
Carlqvist (1978) who ﬁnd, for a strong circular aurora of diameter 5,000 km, a total
current of about 7 MA. If this pertains to 56 ﬁlaments (before the ring is formed),
each ﬁlament conducts 125 kA. Hence, Eq. (2.60) is satisﬁed, and the currents re-
main as pinched ﬁlaments.
In an intense aurora, the giga-ampere current ﬂow and concomitant strong mag-
netic ﬁeld produces a major change in the auroral-height proﬁle. Because of the
intense plasma ﬂow and strong longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, the plasma forms a thin
but dense sheath or plasma column in its propagation toward Earth.
The in-ﬂowing plasma is a Z-pinch, and as a result, Z-pinch instabilities form
as well as intense radiation from the relativistic electrons. The intense radiation
consists primarily of X-rays and synchrotron radiation in the visible.
12.8 Temporal Occurrence and Properties of Intense Auroras
The properties of intense aurora described by Gold (1962) appear to be similar to
the properties of a column of plasma-conducting giga-amperes of current rather than
mega-amperes.
According to Gold, a very intense aurora might be expected to occur every sev-
eral thousand of years or even every 10,000 years.
A 1,000–fold increase of a concurrent aurora is 7 GA, or for 56 ﬁlaments,
1.25 MA carried by a ﬁlament REB. This is what was seen in antiquity, often carved
on granite or recorded in other ways (Chap. 13).

12.9 The Carrington Event
355
12.9 The Carrington Event
The Carrington event, August 27–September 6, 1859, was the most famous solar
storm in modern history and, for the ﬁrst time, veriﬁed that the Sun and aurora
were connected by strong ionospheric currents (Clark 2007). A signiﬁcant portion
of 200,000km of telegraph lines on Earth were adversely affected, some made in-
operable for 8 h. At its height the Type A aurora was described as blood or deep
crimson red that was so bright that one “could read a newspaper by”.
On August 28, 1859 a major solar storm caused spectacular aurora seen all over
the globe.It was reported in all the major newspapers, poems were written about it,
and famous artists painted its shapes and forms. It also caused severe problems with
telegraph networks at the time, which lasted for many hours world-wide. Reports
from widely different locations on Earth have been given by Clauer and Siscoe
(2006) and Green et al. (2006).
1. Galveston, Texas: “August 28 as early as twilight closed, the northern sky was
reddish, and at times lighter than other portions of the heavens. At 7:30 PM a
few streamers showed themselves. Soon the whole sky from Ursa Major to the
zodiac in the east was occupied by the streams or spiral columns that rose from
the horizon. Spread over the same extent was an exquisite roseate tint which
faded and returned. Stately columns of light reaching up about 45 degrees above
the horizon moved westward. There were frequent ﬂashes of lightning along the
whole extent of the aurora. At 9:00 PM the whole of the streaking had faded
leaving only a sort of twilight over the northern sky.”
2. London, England: “At 0:15 AM on August 28th the auroral light in the north
assumed the form of a luminous arch, similar to daybreak, and in the southwest
there was an intense glare of red covering a very large extent of the sky. At
00:20 AM streamers appeared; at 00:25 AM the streamers rose to the zenith and
were tinged with crimson at their summits. At 00:45 AM frequent coruscations
appeared in the aurora. At 01:20 AM the arch which had partially faded began
to reform and the body of the light was very strong but not bright enough to read
newspaper print. At 1:30 AM the light had begun to fade. By 2:00 AM the aurora
was very indistinct.”
Certainly, these descriptions do not match what is seen during today’s auroras.
However, historically, such accounts are found nearly every few centuries; stronger
events every century, and cataclysmic events every several millinnea.
A complete picture of the Earth-current environment is made possible from his-
torical eye-witness accounts, telegrapher’s galvanometer needle deﬂections, and
from a number of terrella experiment observations. This is shown in Fig. 12.16:
56 current ﬁlaments along a N-S axis enclosing an eastward turning globe whose
altitude is determined by the strength of the current driving the ﬁlamentation.
This geometry (Fig. 12.16), as observed from different locations on the globe at
eye–level will be investigated in Chap. 13.
An artists depiction of the synchrotron emitting atmospheric currents is shown in
Fig. 12.17.

12.10 THEMIS Mission
357
Historical accounts suggest that intense aurora differs from concurrent aurora in
several aspects. One Chinese account (translated from Sung-Shih) is,
Red cloud spreading all over the sky, and among the red bands of white vapor like glossed
silk penetrating it. They arose from Tzu-wei, invading the Great Dipper and the Wen-Chang,
and then dispersed from the southeast.
In Europe during medieval times,
Swords, spears, white vapor, like glossed silk penetrating, candles in the sky, a red sky
patterned with white stripes stretching from horizon to horizon.
and in Europe, North America, and other parts of the world in 1859,
A vivid red light on the landscape and ’a thousand fantastic ﬁgures, as if painted with ﬁre
on a black ground’
12.10 THEMIS Mission
THEMIS, Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms,
is a European Space Agency (ESA) venture, a quintet of satellites located about
40,000 km above the Arctic pole. THEMIS is the ﬁrst experiment in the near-
Earth plasma to study macroscale physics during auroral substorms and greatly
expanded since its initiation in 2007 (Burch and Angelopoulos 2012; Peratt et al.
2009; Rantsev-Kartinov 2006).8
The THEMIS spacecraft discovery of large holes in the Earth’s magnetosphere
explains an anomaly in the global distribution of petroglyphs on our planet (Li
2007). Previously it was reported on the GPS world-wide logging of some four-
million of these objects, each a picture of a ﬁlamental MHD instability carved in
rock (Peratt 2003; Peratt et al. 2007; Q¨oyawayma and Peratt 2007; Yao and Peratt
2007).
THEMIS researchers have also uncovered what appears to be the earliest records
of what was seen in antiquity regarding aurora; 30,000 B.C. Cro-Magnon cave
paintings depictions of aurora (Sisco 1976; Eather 1980). Other ancient pictograph
recordings, written in 2,600 B.C. in China include “Fu-Pao, the mother of the Yel-
low Empire Shuan-Yuan (Aurora History 2009)”.
NASA, in the 2007 annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, reported
on the time history of events and macroscale interactions during substorms. The
8 An anonymous referee, when asked by the Austrian Science Fund to evaluate a new proposal
entitled “TCR evolution and energy transport in the Earth’s magnetotail”, replied, “This is an ex-
cellent topic of inquiry and much needed for continued understanding of our near-Earth plasma
environment. The database, to date, is inadequately tapped and should greatly enhance our under-
standing of the complex phenomena, largely unanticipated but discovered in the THEMIS mission.
From a scientiﬁc point-of-view, this undertaking is certainly worthy of funding from the scientiﬁc
agencies.”

Chapter 13
Plasma Astrophysics
The study of astrophysics in modern times should essentially involve the application of
laboratory results to cosmical problems, with help from theoretical physics. In the realm
of plasma physics, there appears to be no reason why known basic laws, formulated in the
laboratory, should not hold just as well at the astrophysical and cosmological scale.
Hannes Alfv´en, Plasma Physics Applied to Cosmology, Physics Today, 1971.
13.1 The Cosmic–Triple–Jump
From the latter half of the nineteenth century through the twentieth century, research
on the plasma state of matter led to a number of discoveries revealing a close tie of
the physics of plasmas at the smallest known scale, e.g., the ﬂow of charged particles
in crystal lattices, to microampere particle beams, to intense particle beams, to the
currents associated with planetary and solar plasmas, to the interstellar medium, to
galaxies, and intergalactic plasmas (Alfv´en 1971).1
Alfv´en made note that the plasma, or original state of matter, scaled. It was found
experimentally and veriﬁed numerically, that the dimensionless parameters were
valid regardless of whether the plasma was measured in microns or gigaparsecs
(Fig. 13.1).
From this, Alfv´en hypothesized a Cosmic–Triple–Jump for the state of plasma,
scaled according to size but equally valid in other dimensionless parameters. In size
he chose 109, such that starting with his smallest dimension, laboratory plasma, he
could scale in three 109 m (giga)–steps to the Hubble distance (Alfv´en 1975, 1983,
1986; Gurnett and Bhattacharjee 2005, 2009; Kukushkin and Rantsev-Kartinov
1999; Suplee 2009).
That 27 orders of magnitude is not beyond human comprehension, the reader
should consult T. Eastman (2013) and C. and R. Eames article on powers of 10
(Eames and Eames 2011).

13.2 Near-Earth Plasma Astrophysics
13.2.1 “Earth–Currents”
Again we repeat a sage prediction5:
A reason why Birkeland currents are particularly interesting is that, in the plasma forced to
carry them, they cause a number of plasma physical processes to occur —. These in turn
lead to consequences such as acceleration of charged particles, both positive and negative
—. Both of these classes of phenomena should have a general astrophysical interest far
beyond that of understanding the space environment of our own Earth.

5 The sightings of brilliant bands of light across the sky frightened people long before their me-
dieval observation. “Earth–Currents” became known in the western–world with the invention of
the compass. Today, both phenomena are known to be caused by Birkeland Currents.

13.2 Near-Earth Plasma Astrophysics
363
Carl-Gunne F¨althammar, Near-earth manifestations of the plasma universe, 1986
(F¨althammar 1986)
The general direction of the westward motion of the “Earth-Current” ﬁlaments
were known as early as 1859 from telegraph galvanometer measurements, e.g.,
between Red Hill and Brighton in London (Walker 1861). However, there is little
need to go through telegraphers (and scientists) current deﬂection logs to determine
the exact current ﬂow as mankind has measured and recorded these for tens of mil-
lennia if not longer. During intense events, the current ﬂow is true north-south, or
for intense synchrotron light emitting relativistic electrons, towards true north from
geophysical south.
13.2.2 View of Birkeland Currents from Ica and Palpa, Peru
In South America, ﬂat desert terrain and mesas are sometimes marked by kilometer–
long, man–made lines. Most of these cross each other at various angles and others
start or end with trapezoidal proﬁles. Construction techniques involve the up-turning
of large amounts of patinated stones to show the light colored ground beneath or in
areas covered by ﬂat heavily patinated stones (pavement), ﬂipping the stones to
place the whitish under–layer on top–a technique also common to the American
southwest (Fig. 13.2).
Markings such as these are found among the Lluta Valley geoglyphs near Arica,
Chile, many parts of Brazil, in northern Venezuela (Deutsch and Peratt 1997), and
other regions on Earth. The best known cases are the lines at Palpa, south of Ica,
Peru (14.7◦S, 75.1◦W).
What makes the Peruvian lines unique is the sudden ﬂaring of a straight line into
a trapezoid geometry (Fig. 13.5). As seen from the ground, the Birkeland currents
incoming vertically from the solar plasma above and towards Antarctica suddenly
ﬂare upwards to follow Earth’s curvature until exiting in the Arctic region. These
were seen as white light on the ground, not moving for perhaps centuries.
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) provides a date as to when the feldspar
and quartz grains of a stone surface, buried since construction of temples, limestone
pyramids, and megalithic structures, gives an age for the event of the last exposure
to light. This technique requires a stringent protocol for the evaluation of doses on
a stone surface and an exacting extraction of the stone in the absence of any ambi-
ent light, e.g., moon, stars, etc., and ﬁeld/laboratory handling. In a dark laboratory,
660Δ20 nm, 5–10 μW cm−2, the upper-most 2 mm slice of the light-protected stone
sample was stimulated with green and blue (when possible) lasers ∼(24 mW cm−2)
at the sample surface. A construction stone chosen, 20 cm below present ground
level of a selected Palpa line, for which the OSL age was determined to be 56.7 ka
(Greilich et al. 2005).

Near Palpa, along the Panamerican highway to the Cerro Carapo, situated on

that number 14, 28, 56, 112, and 224 have been used in their construction. The
center mandala has concentric ring diameters of 74.2, 41, 27.4, and 15.3 m. For
clarity, we also discuss a second mandala (NE-most), see Fig. 13.3. Aerial and
satellite (Quickbird) and Los Alamos imagery were used.
For comparison we show the center mandala Fig. 13.4. The white markings, from
center, denote an aerial view of Stonehenge: The stones about the center are, in
order, a horseshoe of small inner bluestones, ﬁve pairs of ‘trilithon’ sarsens with a
lintel stone atop each pair, a ring of undressed bluestones, an outer sarsen circle with
a continuous layer of lintels (30) on top (shown as the continuous white ring), the Z
holes (30), the Y holes (30), followed by 56 outer-most Aubrey holes on a 84 m in
diameter.
The black markings, the locations of cairns that deﬁne the mandala geometry are
still visiable in spite of their apparent age. The appearance is that of markers seen
today melting into the desert pavement. The complexity and apparent effort of con-
struction is noteworthy. Also, the orientation of the overlaid image of Stonehenge
and the NE corner of the framing square are exact. While there is no central struc-
ture within the outer sarsen circle, the close ﬁt cairns are an exact ﬁt to the circle.
The remaining stone portions of Stonehend have no mandala equivalent. Instead 16
rays emanate from the center out to the Z holes. The 16 rays are typical of rayed
recordings in South America.

the center to an outside rock cairn (Photo by A. L. Peratt)
In comparison, one of the mandalas has 224 (4×56) outer cairns whereas Stone-
henge has 56 Aubrey holes on the outer periphery. The former corresponds to an
age where the plasma ﬁlaments have not yet merged to 56 or lesser numbers (see
Fig. 12.3). Second, the Y and Z rings of Stonehenge, never circular, show the onset
of a later time diocotron instability, that is, Buneman’s chasing instability (In petro-
glyphs (Fig. 12.1)).
Many thousands of man-made objects, while of widely varying sizes, replicate
the Stonehenge pattern (Peratt 2001, 2003; Q¨oyawayma and Peratt 2007; Peratt and
Yao 2008a,b), all recordings of intense, focused, synchrotron light skyward.

z-pinches such as shown in Figs. 2.27 and 2.21.

Supernova 1987a, that burst upon the scene just prior to the ﬁrst edition of this
book, has now been studied for over 20 years. During this time the 28 ﬁlaments in
the circular center of the wheel lemniscoid have become better deﬁned with better
observing telescopes, Fig. 13.6.

sheet hyperboloid with a wheel lemniscoid at the center pinch. (Right); 28 ﬁlaments are discernable
in the z-pinch region. For example, see Figure 13.3
Thus, two-thirds of the way through Alfv´en’s cosmic-triple-jump, astrophysical
entities appear to differ in no appreciable way from their high-energy laboratory
counterparts (F¨althammar 1986).
13.4 Galaxies in Plasma Cosmic Space
13.4.1 Double Radio Galaxies
Among the largest entities detected in the universe, other than multi-megaparsec
plasma ﬁlaments, are double radio galaxies. In size, these radio sources extend for
hundreds of kiloparsecs (1021−1022 m) to a few mega-parsecs (1021−1022 m). Dou-
ble radio galaxies are thought to have densities of 10−3 cm−3 and magnetic ﬁelds of
the order of 10−4 G (Figs. 13.8 and 13.9).
The radiation produced by two plasma ﬁlaments in proximity replicate both the
isophotal and power spectra from double radio galaxies (Fig. 13.7). Time evolves

10.4–58.7 Myr. Time increases from left to right
from left to right in this ﬁgure, 10.4–58.7Myr. The rise of this synchrotron pulse
was initiated when portions of two megaparsec long plasma ﬁlaments became par-
allel when about 20 kpc apart (Fig. 13.7). The top row shows, from left to right,
three radio telescope observations of three different double galaxies taken from
three different parts of the sky and reﬂecting three different radio snapshots of their
respective evolution. The bottom row shows the computer simulations of a single
laboratory plasma experiment at three different moments of its evolution in physical
space-time.
Likely not recognized before Alfv´en and Bostick, is the fact that each of the two
time intervals between the three different galaxies, at the top, represents a span of
time of about 20 million years, while the intervals between the different moments of
the laboratory plasma experiment, in the bottom, represents a few microseconds. If
the top set of recordings is projected onto the bottom set of recordings, as if through
a conical projection of millions of years long, everything is mapped as being the
same including the proportional magnitudes of time. One now has the ability to
forecast what a double radio galaxy will be like millions of years into the future.
As will be shown, radio galaxy 3C 315 is starting a rotation that will evolve into
a spiral galaxy, i.e., NGC 4151 (Fig. 13.9).
13.4.2 Spiral Galaxies
In reference to Sect. 3.10 on page 109 and Sect. 6.5.2 on page 237, updated simula-
tions of a the spiral magnetic ﬁelds and their ﬁeld strengths are shown in Fig. 13.8.

The spiral layout of the gray bands gives the circumpolar direction of the galac-
tic magnetic ﬁeld, while the height of any band provides an estimate of the ﬁeld
strengths, 5−70μG.
Figure 13.9 shows the plasma spiral formed in this simulation overlayed on its
magnetic ﬁeld line (squared) isobars. The diameter of the spiral is about 50 kpc
with a mass of 1041 kg, i.e., a size and mass of that observed from spiral galaxies.
A direct comparison to observations is made by superimposing the HI distribution
in NG4151 on its optical photograph. The observation show two peaks in neutral
hydrogen surrounding a void. The void is oriented towards one of the galactic arms.
The simulation allows the two peaks to be traced back to their origin. Both are found
to be the femnants of the originally extended components, i.e., cross–sections of the
original Birkeland ﬁlaments. The hydrogen deﬁcient center is the remnant of an
older elliptical galaxy formed midway between the ﬁlaments, in the magnetic null.
The velocity consists essentially of a linearly increasing component due to a central
body undergoing rigid rotation, with two “ﬂat” components on either side of r = 0
due to the trailing arms.

Transmission Lines
A.1 Cosmic Filaments as Transmission Lines
The high conductivity of cosmic plasma permits electric currents to ﬂow that
constrict the plasma to ﬁlaments. These current-carrying ﬁlaments form trans-
mission lines which allow electric energy to be transported over large distances.
Transmission lines consist of an assemblage of two or more conducting paths. Trans-
mission lines on earth, used for communications and the transport of electric energy,
employ conductors that are usually arranged parallel to a common axis. This need
not be the case in space and is often not the case in ﬁlamentary current-conducting
plasma in pulsed-power generators. Nevertheless, a simpliﬁcation in analysis results
if we assume parallel conducting paths. The generalization to nonparallel transmis-
sion lines, such as radially converging lines, is a straightforward extension of the
theory. For the case at hand, the geometric and physical parameters of the line (the
nature of the conductors and of the dielectric) are assumed to be constant every-
where along the line; this is the hypothesis of homogeneity of the line. This assem-
blage of conductors comprises two groups of at least one conductor each, one group
being the forward conductors, and the other the return conductors. The simpliﬁed
theory of lines that is to be treated here assumes that the lateral dimensions of the
line are negligible, or, more precisely, that the time of propagation of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld between the forward and return conductors in a plane perpendicular
to the axis of the line is negligible with respect to the duration of the briefest of the
phenomena to be studied. This restriction leads to the second fundamental hypoth-
esis, that of the conservation of current across a plane is zero, which is to say that
the current through the forward conductors is equal, but in the opposite sense to the
current through the return conductors. These two fundamental hypotheses reduce
the theory of transmission lines to a problem of partial differential equations in two
variables (time and one space variable taken along the axis of the line). The general
case would lead to partial differential equations in time and three space variables.
With no loss of generality, it can be assumed that the line is composed of only two
conductors. This considerably simpliﬁes the deﬁnition of per unit length parameters

Fig. A.1 A two-conductor transmission line
of the line. Frequently the additional hypothesis of symmetry of the line is made,
motivated by the two-wire line having two identical cylindrical conductors. This
hypothesis is by no means necessary, and most lines in space do not have this sym-
metry and may not even be everywhere cylindrical. Nevertheless, we will appeal
to this simpliﬁcation in establishing the general line equations (Bekeﬁ1966; Book
1987; Stix 1962).
A.2 Deﬁnition of the State of the Line at a Point
Let us consider an ideal two-conductor transmission line, having forward and return
conductors reduced to straight lines (Fig. A.1). Let MN be the intersection of the
transmission line with a plane perpendicular to the line and located a distance x
along an axis Ox parallel to the line. Arbitrarily choose AB to be the forward con-
ductor and A′B′ to be the return conductor. The current in the line at the abscissa
x is deﬁned to be the current ﬂowing in conductor AB at point M. It is taken to
be positive if it is directed in the sense Ox, i.e., if it ﬂows from M toward B. By
the hypotheses of conservation of current, the current at N is equal and opposite to
the current at M. If phiM and phiN are, respectively, the potentials of points M and
N with respect to some reference potential, the line voltage at the abscissa x will be
φx = φM −φN
(A.1)
A.3 Primary Parameters
We will use the term parameter for the quantities to be deﬁned below, rather than
the term constant often used. The latter term arises from the fact that discussions
of transmission lines on earth most often consider only sinusoidal waves of a given
frequency. On the contrary, we will be especially interested in the pulse regime,
which corresponds to a large band of frequencies. (The pulse may be measured
in seconds, minutes, or hours; or in days, years, centuries, millinia, or megayears
or more, but its duration is δt = δx/c ≪l/c, where l is the total length of the

transmission line). At least two of the parameters of interest are strong functions of
frequency: the resistance per unit length, affected by the electromagnetic skin depth,
δ =

2
ωμσ
(A.2)
and the conductance per unit length, affected by the variations of dielectric losses
with frequency. Nevertheless, in deriving the equations of interest, we will suppose
that these parameters are constants. Since the line is homogeneous, the total resis-
tance of the conductors is proportional to the length of the line. A resistance per
unit length R can thus be deﬁned. In the same way a self-inductance per unit length
L can be deﬁned, which is the result of the true self-inductance of the conductors
and the mutual inductance between the two conductors. Because of the imperfect
properties of the plasma dielectric between conductors (losses in the dielectric that
separates the conductors), a uniformly distributed transverse conductance appears.
It is thus possible to deﬁne a transverse conductance per unit length G. This is the
ratio of the charge on a unit length conductor element to the voltage between the two
conductors at the element considered. The capacitance per unit length is denoted C.
A.4 General Equations

A.5 Heaviside’s Operational Calculus (The Laplace Transform)
A.5.1 The Propagation Function
Consider a transmission line such as deﬁned above, having per unit length parame-
ters L, C, R, and G, and of length l, as shown in Fig. A.3.
At the instant t = 0, an electromotive force Θ(t) arising from a voltage source
with internal impedance Zg, is applied to the left end, or input, of the line. The right
end, or load, is terminated in an impedance ZL. The currents and voltages at each
point along the line are assumed to be zero prior to the initial time t = 0. The prob-
lem is to calculate the voltage φ(x,t) between the two conductors of the line, and
the current i(x,t) ﬂowing in each of these conductors, at each point x and at each in-
stant t. The distance x is taken to be positive in the direction to the left of the origin,
or generator side of the line.

This last quantity, which has the dimensions of an impedance, is called the charac-
teristic impedance of the line. It is related to the physical properties of the line, i.e.,
to its dimensions and to its conductive and dielectric properties. It is a function of s,
and hence of time. We will write Zc (s) simply as Zc.
The general solutions of Eqs. (A.17) and (A.18) are thus

A.7 Reﬂection Coefﬁcients
The complete solution to Eq. (A.21) is obtained by determining the functions 1
and 2 using the boundary conditions at the ends of the line. In space plasmas,
the end of a transmission line may be a planetary ionosphere or wherever else
the conductivity between conducting paths becomes large. Arc discharges across
dielectrics (Sect. 4.6.1) make excellent terminations.
Let Φ (s) ⇔Φ (t) be the transform of the generator voltage. At the input to the
line x = 0

Equations (A.11), (A.12), and (A.30) give waveforms in remarkably good agree-
ment with waveforms measured by probes placed within the transmission line. For
example, very low resistances caused by dielectric surface ﬂashover in pulsed-power
transmission lines can be determined to an accuracy of less than 1 % if waveforms
are available for at least two spatial locations in the line. The problem reduces to
iterating Eq. (A.30) in Rg and Rl until a best ﬁt between calculated and measured
waveforms is obtained. Losses in the propagating current and voltage pulses are of
course determined by this procedure.
A.8.1 Cosmic Transmission-Line
Consider for illustration a hypothetical planetary ionosphere-magnetosphere trans-
mission line model (Fig. A.4) that might be applied to the geometry of Figs. 1.9
and 4.24 Allis et al. (1963). Assume a −40 kV and 250 ms perturbation at the
source. We arbitrarily take a source impedance of 2 Ω, a characteristic transmis-
sion line impedance of 0.4 Ω, and an ionosphere (load) impedance of 0.1 Ω. The
transmission line length is 6 × 108 m. With these parameter values a probe (space-
craft) located at a distance 108 m from the source would measure the current and
voltage transients depicted in Fig. A.5. After a time 3.3 s following the peak voltage
spike from the perturbation, the probe would measure the ﬁrst ionospheric reﬂection
signal and, if the source impedance differs from the transmission line impedance, it
would also measure a reﬂected signal from the source 0.7 s later. Since the ampli-
tude of the reﬂections depend on the reﬂection coefﬁcients Eqs. (A.23) and (A.26),
an accurate determination of the source and ionospheric impedance can be made.
If probe measurements are available at two spatial locations, the waveforms from
Eq. (A.30) are uniquely determined and can be used to ascertain the impedances and
their locations. In laboratory application, precise determination of the impedances
and positions of high-voltage surface ﬂashovers (Sect. 4.6.1) has been achieved.

(B.7)
The magnitude n = |n| is the ratio of light to the phase velocity. The reciprocal of n
is the wave phase velocity divided by the velocity of light. The wave normal surface
is the locus of the tip of the vector n−1 ≡n/n2.
Figure B.1 is a plot of phase velocity surfaces for electromagnetic waves. The
ordinate is ω2
b/ω2 while the abscissa is ω2
b/ω2. The symbols L, R, X, and O de-
note left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP), right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP),
extraordinary, and ordinary wave types, respectively. This ﬁgure is called a Clem-
mow.Mullaly.Allis or CMA diagram (Allis et al. 1963) and is to be interpreted as a
“plasma pond” for a two-component plasma where cross-sections of the allowable
wave normal surfaces are shown. The surfaces are typically in the form of spheres,
ellipsoids, and wheel and dumbbell lemniscoids. The diagram is divided up into 13
regions, each of which supports two independent modes.
The signiﬁcance of the different regions is due to “boundaries” where the re-
fractive indices go either as n2 →0(vph →∞) called a “cutoff” condition, or
n2 →∞(vph →0) called a “resonance” condition (Table B.1). Waves are reﬂected at
cutoffs and absorbed at resonances.
The cross-sections in Fig. B.1 are not to scale, but the speed of light in relation
to the velocities lies generally between the two cross-sections in each region. This
divides the wave normal surfaces into “fast” and “slow” modes. The various wave
types and their locations in Fig. B.1 are delineated in Table B.2.
Substituting Eq. (B.7) into Eq. (B.6) gives a wave equation in terms of n

The solutions of Eq. (B.10) reduce to simple expressions when θ = 0 and θ = π/2:
n2 = R, L
θ = 0
n2 = RL/S,P
θ = π/2
(B.11)
The polarization relations between the cartesian ﬁeld components of E follow from
Eq. (B.10)
Ex : Ey : Ez = (S −n2)(P−n2sin2 θ) : −iD(P−n2sin2 θ) : −(S −n2)n2 cosθ sinθ
(B.12)
If θ = 0, Eq. (B.12) shows that Ez = 0(E ⊥B0) and, if n2 = R, then Ex/Ey = −i. This
means that Ex is 90◦ahead of Ey and, by convention, the polarization is right-hand
circular. If n2 = L, Ex/Ey = i and the polarization is left-hand circular. Figure B.3a
illustrates these modes of propagation.
For the case θ = π/2 and n2 = P, Ex = Ey = 0(E∥B0). When n2 = RL/S, Ez =
0(E ⊥B0). For this case the electric ﬁeld circumscribes an ellipse in a plane of y.
The modes n2 = P and n2 = RL/S are called the “ordinary” and “extraordinary”
waves, respectively. These terms have been taken from crystal optics; however the
terms have been interchanged in plasma physics, since the “extraordinary” mode
is affected by B0 whereas the “ordinary” mode is not. Figure B.3b illustrates these
modes of propagation.
Expressed in spherical coordinates Eq. (B.12) is
Ek : Eθ : Eφ = (S−n2)(P−n2)sinθ : −(S−n2)Pcosθ : −iD(P−n2sin2 θ) (B.13)
which shows that Ek and Eθ are in phase while Eφ is out of phase by 90◦. Figure B.4
shows the orientation of the ﬁeld vectors. The vector E is elliptically polarized in a
plane containing the y direction and the resultant of Ek and Eθ.

Appendix C
Dusty and Grain Plasmas
In general, the motion of a solid particle in a plasma obeys Eq. (2.11)
mdv
dt = mg + q(E+ v × B)−mvcv + f
(C.1)
where m and q are the mass and the electric charge of the particle, respectively,
g = ˆrGm(r)/r2 is the gravitational acceleration, −mvcv is due to viscosity, and f is
the sum of all other forces, including the radiation pressure.
Depending on the size of the particle, four typical cases are delineable:
1. Very small particles. The term q(E+ v × B) in Eq. (C.1) dominates over mg and
the particle is part of a dusty plasma (Sect. C.1). Under cosmic conditions this
is true if the size of the particle is less than 10 nm. In the case of large electric
charges the limiting size may rise to 100 nm.
2. Small Grains. For this case, q/m ≈
√
G. Plasma effects still play a major role in
system dynamics (Sect. C.2).
3. Large Grains. If the size of the particle is so large that the electromagnetic term
is negligible, we have an intermediate case dominated by viscosity and gravity.
The particles in this regime are referred to as grains. Their equation of motion is
mvcv = mg
(C.2)
Under conditions in interstellar clouds this may be valid for particles of the order
of 10 μm.
4. Large solid bodies. For “particles” of the size of kilometers or more, the iner-
tia and gravitational terms dominate. Electromagnetic forces are negligible, and
viscous forces can be considered as perturbations which may change the orbit
slowly. Depending on the properties of the cosmic cloud, viscous forces become
important for meter or centimeter sizes. The equation of motion Eq.(C.1) is then,
mdv
dt = mg −mvcv

C Dusty and Grain Plasmas
The transition of plasma into stars involves the formation of dusty plasma, the
sedimentation of the dust into grains, the formation of stellesimals, and then the
collapse into a stellar state (Alfv´en and Arrhenius 1976; Alfv´en and Carlqvist
1978).
C.1 Dusty Plasma
An important class of cosmic plasmas are those which are “dusty” (i.e., plasmas
that contain solid matter in the form of very small dust grains). These grains are
electrically charged and if q/m is large enough, the dynamics of the dust grain is
controlled by electromagnetic forces (Mendis 1979; Hill and Mendis 1979, 1980;
Houpis 1987; Azar and Thompson 1989; Horanyi and Goertz 1990.
The temperature of the dust in a cosmic plasma may differ by orders of magni-
tude from the temperature of the plasma. For example, the temperature of the dust
radiating into space through a transparent plasma may be 10 K, the molecular tem-
perature 100 K, the ion temperature 103 K, and the electron temperature 104 K.
Dusty plasma is characterized by solid particles of mass m, charge q, and a
charge-to-mass ratio that is much greater than the square-root of the gravitational
constant, q/m ≫
√
G. The dust grains are charged negatively by impacts from
streams of electrons. The loss of negative charge can be due to the photoeffect, ﬁeld
emission, and ion impacts. Normally, the potential of a dust grain may be 1–10 V,
positive or negative. However, if the electron stream responsible for the charge is
relativistic, the grain can charge up to several kilovolts (Deforest 1972; Reasoner
1976; Mendis 1979.
C.2 Grain Plasma
Consider a plasma whose dust may have accreted into macroscopic solid matter. For
simplicity, the plasma is taken to consist of two components: grains with mass mg
and charge qg, and particles with mass mp and charge qp. The grains are assumed
to be weakly charged with qg/mg ∼
√
G. The particles may be electrons, ions, dust,
or some other unspeciﬁed charge mass with the property mp ≪mg (Wollman 1988;
Gisler and Wollman 1988).
Consider a spherically symmetric gravitational condensation of the plasma, so
that the parameters depend only on the distance r from the center. The dynamics
of the grain ﬂuid are speciﬁed by Eqs. (2.13) and (2.15) where ng(r) is the number
density, and N(r) and M(r) are the total grain number and grain mass inside r,
respectively. The total mass and net charge inside radius r are
MT ≡MT(r) ≡mgNg + mpNp
QT ≡QT (r) ≡qgNg −qpNp

C.2 Grain Plasma
393
If the plasma is tenous and in thermal equilibrium, dv/dt = 0; the electrostatic
potential at qg is φ = QT/4πε0r , and the gravitational potential at mg is φG =
−GMT/r. Substituting these parameters into Eq. (2.13) while (momentarily) ne-
glecting B, gives the following, for grains and particles, respectively:

Some insight into the meaning of Eqs. (C.4) and (C.5) is possible by considering
the special case Tg = Tp = T, and scale lengths n−1
g d ng/d r = n−1
p dnp/dr , for the
grain plasma and particle plasmas, respectively. For these conditions, Eqs. (C.4) and
(C.5) reduce to

be written,

Now consider the behavior of the particle scale height relative to the grain scale
height. The particle scale height parameter r0p is deﬁned by the relation
qpNp(r0p) = qqNq(r0)
Now write, ignoring the particle mass with respect to the grain mass,

This analysis is valid insofar as thermalization is efﬁcient, so that the formation of
condensation heats the plasma and Tp = Tg. This increases the Debye length. Then
the condition for charge separation is equivalent to the condition for poor shielding
of Jeans mass concentrations.
The inclusion of B causes a E × B drift of the low mass component around the
axis at the center of the spherical condensation. Strong magnetic ﬁelds invalidate
the concept of a Jeans mass (Sect. 2.7.1).
