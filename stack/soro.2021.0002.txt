Abstract
This work presents a unique approach to the design, fabrication, and characterization of paper-based origami
robotic systems consisting of stackable pneumatic actuators. These paper-based actuators (PBAs) use materials
with high elastic modulus-to-mass ratios, accordion-like structures, and direct coupling with pneumatic pressure
for extension and bending. The study contributes to the scientiﬁc and engineering understanding of foldable
components under applied pneumatic pressure by constructing stretchable and ﬂexible structures with intrin-
sically nonstretchable materials. Experiments showed that a PBA possesses a power-to-mass ratio greater than
80 W/kg, which is more than four times that of human muscle. This work also illustrates the stackability and
functionality of PBAs by two prototypes: a parallel manipulator and a legged locomotor. The manipulator con-
sisting of an array of PBAs can bend in a speciﬁc direction with the corresponding actuator inﬂated. In
addition, the stacked actuators in the manipulator can rotate in opposite directions to compensate for relative
rotation at the ends of each actuator to work in parallel and manipulate the platform. The locomotor rotates
the PBAs to apply and release contact between the feet and the ground. Furthermore, a numerical model
developed in this work predicts the mechanical performance of these inﬂatable actuators as a function
of dimensional speciﬁcations and folding patterns. Overall, we use stacked origami actuators to implement
functionalities of manipulation, gripping, and locomotion as conventional robotic systems. Future origami robots
made of paper-like materials may be suitable for single use in contaminated or unstructured environments or
low-cost educational materials.

Introduction
P
aper continues to receive attention as a material for
electronics and robotics due to its low cost, recyclability,
and foldability. For electronics, many state-of-the-art paper-
based devices have included sensors,1–6 methods of energy
storage,7–9 transistors,10–13 and electrochemical detectors.14–16
Paper-based robots beneﬁt from the folding and cutting tech-
niques of paper—origami/kirigami—to achieve large defor-
mation. These techniques apply to other paper-like materials,
including plastic sheets, which are thin, foldable, and intrin-
sically nonstretchable. Like conventional rigid robots, ori-
gami and kirigami robots can perform fundamental tasks
such as walking, crawling, grasping, and manipulating ob-
jects.17–26 Despite using nonstretchable paper-like materials,
these origami and kirigami robots enable motions with large
amplitudes using highly deformable structures. These robots
are comparable to elastomer-based soft robots, adaptable to
their surroundings, and similar in their movements to some
living organisms, such as a worm and an octopus.
Previous studies in soft robotics have mainly focused on
elastomer-based actuators and origami/kirigami-based actua-
tors. Elastomer-based actuators have multiple modes of oper-
ation, including bending, extension, twisting, and rotation27–39;
origami/kirigami-based actuators accomplished similar modes
through using highly deformable structures.17–26,40,41 How-
ever, current origami and kirigami actuators may have lim-
ited output force and power. The power-to-mass ratios
(PMRs) of many state-of-the-art pneumatic, elastomer-based
actuators are several kW/kg at modest pressure (hundreds of
kPa),42 while only a few origami actuators with airtight layers
in previous studies approached this level.40,41 Martinez et al.

presented several soft actuators based on kirigami and ori-
gami structures consisting of paper-based skeletons and
elastomeric coatings, which could lift loads that are 120 times
the weight of the actuator (mass is 8.3 g, PMR of 120).40 Li
et al. developed artiﬁcial muscles by origami-inspired actu-
ators made of PVC ﬁlms at a negative pressure; the 2.6-g
actuator had an output power density of 2 kW/kg and lifted a
3-kg object (PMR of 384).41 These results suggest that ori-
gami and kirigami actuators may produce a higher power-to-
mass ratio than human muscle (PMR of 17.6 W/kg43) to
perform robotic tasks.
This study presents paper-based robotic systems designed
with stackable origami actuators (paper-based actuators
[PBAs]), composed of sheets of paper, accordion-like struc-
tures, and direct coupling with pressure for extension and
bending. We chose standard ofﬁce paper as the prototyping
material, which is cellulose based, decomposable, and fold-
able. Our approach also applies to other types of paper-like
materials, such as foldable plastic sheets. Each PBA is an
inﬂatable structure based on triangulated mesh origami,
called Yoshimura patterns.44 Over the past two decades, pre-
vious work has included the geometric description and kine-
matic analysis of origami structures with Yoshimura patterns
(or Kresling patterns).18,45–55 The extensive applications
have demonstrated the potential of these patterns to con-
tribute to robotics,18,40,56 architecture,57,58 and deployable
structures.46,59 This work establishes how PBAs function
in robotic systems with simple assembly. To illustrate the
stackability of these foldable components, we used them to
fabricate a parallel manipulator and a legged locomotor.
Although there have been other origami-inspired pneumatic
actuators, this study presents a unique approach to design
origami robots consisting of stackable actuators. These PBAs
may contribute to compliant, lightweight, and disposable
robotic systems in the future.
Materials and Methods
Principles of PBAs
The stackable PBAs make use of four principles (Fig. 1).
First, the folds of these actuators use hexagonal Yoshimura
patterns (see Supplementary Fig. S1 in Supplemental Data).
A folded actuator has several sections with repeated patterns
and forms a tube with a hexagonal cross-section. Second,
these PBAs extend along their axial direction with pressuri-
zation. During the process of inﬂation, a PBA twists at both
ends. The angle of rotation is 30 between both ends of each
section with full extension. Third, a PBA with original
Yoshimura patterns is a helix that rotates along its axial di-
rection (Fig. 1A). To prevent its self-rotation, we reverse
triangulated mesh at even-numbered sections. Fourth, by tun-
ing the stiffness of paper on one side, a PBA curves to the
opposite stiffer side (Fig. 1B). In this study, we use a coating
technique to reinforce regions of the actuators to tailor the
resulting curvature.
Like mechanical springs, PBAs can stack in series or par-
allel. For serial stacks, PBAs connect with each other from
end to end and share the same internal pneumatic channel. By
stacking actuators in succession, we combine the motion of
multiple PBAs, creating an actuator with new functionality.
For example, if we connect one PBA with a stiff left side and
the other with a stiff right side in series, they can curve to an
S-shape upon inﬂation (Fig. 1C). For parallel stacks, the
motions of the PBAs couple with each other by sharing the
top and bottom ends. We can manipulate parallel stacks of
PBAs by inﬂating separate channels. For example, the par-
allel stack of two PBAs tilts right with the left actuator in-
ﬂated; otherwise, the stack tilts left with the right actuator
inﬂated (Fig. 1D).
Design and fabrication of PBAs
These PBAs are simple to cut, fold, and seal. Supplemen-
tary Figure S1 shows two types of Yoshimura patterns. First,
we use a commercial printer to mark cutting and folding
patterns for a hexagonal tube on a piece of ofﬁce paper of 5 g.
Then, we use liquid glue (Elmer’s Liquid School Glue) to seal
the sides and attach two pieces of cardboard at both ends.
Among the six sections of the folding patterns, four in the
middle are extensible, while the ﬁrst and sixth sections stay
attached to the top and bottom pieces of cardboard. We punch
a hole in the bottom piece of cardboard and insert a plastic
tube ﬁtting as an inlet for pressurized air. In this work, the
basal edge a and basal angle a of the folds are 24 mm and 30,
respectively; the corresponding cross-sectional area of each
actuator is 15 cm2. The mass of a PBA with the tube ﬁtting is
5 g. The original height of the PBA is 9 mm in the compressed
state. When folded patterns expand fully, a PBA elongates
80 cm and rotates 120. It is worth noting that these PBAs are
not airtight, so air leaks from these actuators during inﬂation.
In this work, we use bendable PBAs as ﬁngers of a gripper.
To tune the stiffness of paper, we brush 0.6 mL of M-bond
200 adhesive on one side of an actuator. The liquid adhesive
permeates paper and reinforces regions of the actuators after
the adhesive cures. We reduce the outer diameter of a PBA
from 48 to 30 mm and increase the number of sections from 6
(Fig. 2A) to 12 (Fig. 3) for making a thin and long actuator. In
addition, we use the folding patterns of nonrotatable PBAs to
prevent sliding between grasped objects and the actuators.
While curing, we sandwich a group of bendable PBAs be-
tween two steel bars and compress both ends of the tubes with
the uncured adhesive to a length of 30 mm for setting their
initial length. The cure time is 24 h at room temperature.
Modeling of PBAs
To understand the mechanical performance of the foldable
PBAs under applied pressure, we build a numerical model of
the actuator in COMSOL. To simulate the pressurization of
the PBA, we apply linearly increasing pressure in quasi-static
steps to the inner surface of each triangular face. As a result,
the model simulates the unfolding process of inﬂation of a
PBA (see Supplementary Video S2 in Supplementary Data).
We describe the geometric formulation and modeling of a
PBA in the Supplementary Data S1 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Figure 2B shows the deployment of rotatable Yoshimura
patterns in the simulation. With the increase of pressure, the
creases unfold so that the structure elongates and rotates
about the central axis. To verify the model, we compare the
numerical results to experimental data. In the experiment, we
recorded the relationships between the elongation and rota-
tion of a PBA to describe the unfolding process (see Supple-
mentary Fig. S3 in Supplementary Data for the experimental
setup). Figure 2C shows that the simulated unfolding process
of the folding patterns agrees with the experimental data.

The numerical model of the actuators has some limitations.
First, the model does not consider the leakage of air. The air
pressure required to stretch the actuator in the simulation is
much less than that in the experiment. In the experiment,
some air leaks out of the PBA, demanding the injection of
more compressed air to stretch the actuator. In addition,
a higher set pressure in the experiment drove leaky ﬂow
under pressure, which likely possessed a nonlinear relation-
ship between the payload and the set pressure. Second, the
model assumes that the creases and the triangular faces have
the same material properties. Despite the simpliﬁcations in
our numerical simulations, the model qualitatively predicts
the outputs of the PBA (such as the distribution of stress
and the process of deployment) as a function of dimen-
sional speciﬁcations, folding patterns, and nominal material
properties.
Results
Characterization of PBAs
We characterized the mechanical performance of the PBAs
experimentally. A rotatable PBA without reinforcement coat-
ing lifted 200g of mass at 82.7 kPa (12 psi) in 0.5 s (Fig. 2A),
achieving a PMR of 80.7 W/kg, which is more than four times
that of human muscle (PMR of 17.6 W/kg43). Not surprisingly,
the PMR of these PBAs without an airtight layer is lower than
those of less leaky actuators reported in the literature, among
which the highest PMR of an origami actuator was 2 kW/kg.38
In addition, our paper-based manipulator is lighter and, thus,
has a lower absolute output power than the human hand.
To characterize the mechanical performance of PBAs,
we tested two rotatable and two nonrotatable PBAs. In the
experiment, we increased the pressure of compressed air until

a PBA lifted the payload to its highest position. During three
repeated tests, we inﬂated each actuator >60 times. Figure 2D
shows that two actuators with the same folding patterns had
similar behavior, suggesting that PBAs have a repeatable
mechanical performance. Furthermore, the mechanical per-
formance of rotatable and nonrotatable actuators is similar, as
there is an insigniﬁcant difference between the corresponding
curves of payload to pressure. The simulation results in
Supplementary Figure S4 also illustrated the similarity of
these two types of actuators. After repeated inﬂation, small
cracks (length of 1 mm) appeared at most of the exterior
vertices of the PBAs where the cellulose-based ﬁbers broke.
Although air began to leak from these cracks, the curves in
Figure 2D did not change. Therefore, the new damage that
occurred during the repeated tests had an insigniﬁcant effect
on the mechanical performance of our actuators. For more
details, see Supplementary Data S1.
To characterize the bending and loading capabilities of
the bendable PBAs, we used graph paper and a camera to
record the position of the actuators as a function of pressure
(Fig. 3A). We ﬁxed the base of a bendable actuator on a test
rig and measured the tilt angle h of the top piece of cardboard
relative to ground and the horizontal elongation of the PBAs
(i.e., the displacement d of Point P in the horizontal direc-
tion). When the pressure increased from 0 to 28 kPa, angle h
changed from 55 to 95, and the displacement d was 12 mm.
In the example shown in Figure 3B, the gripper consisted of
four bendable PBAs. We characterized the loading capability
of the gripper in Figure 3B (see Supplementary Data S1 for
more details). In the demonstration shown in Figure 3C, we
used the gripper to grasp and lift small household objects,
such as plush toys, a tape dispenser, and a packaged snack
food (see Supplementary Video S1 in Supplementary Data).
Design and demonstration of a parallel manipulator
The PMR of PBAs (81 W/kg) reported in this work is higher
compared with human muscle (PMR of 17.6 W/kg), so
PBAs have the potential to handle and transfer lightweight
objects graspable by a single human hand. To show the

potential applications of PBAs, we present a robotic arm
consisting of a paper-based gripper (Fig. 3B) and a parallel
manipulator (Fig. 4A). We arranged three actuators into an
equilateral triangle pattern and sandwiched them between
two pieces of cardboard. We call the top and bottom pieces
of cardboard the platform and the substrate, respectively
(Fig. 4B). If the platform and substrate of three PBAs were to
rotate relative to each other, the manipulator would lock
because the twisting actuators would jam with each other. To
avoid this jamming behavior, we stacked two rotatable PBAs
with mirrored symmetry in series. The upper PBA rotated
clockwise, while the lower PBA rotated counterclockwise.
As a result, the twists of the two rotatable PBAs canceled
each other.
A LabVIEW interface with multichannel solenoid valves
allows selective inﬂation of the actuators. We use a pneu-
matic regulator to set the pressure of compressed air and
mount the substrate of the manipulator on a test rig. Seven
combinations of inﬂated actuators corresponded to seven
directions of bending, which are 0, –60, –120, –180,
and a vertical direction (Fig. 4A). When we tested the ma-
nipulator, we noticed two difﬁculties in the deﬂation of the
actuators. First, some triangular faces were unable to col-
lapse to their original positions. Second, even if all the faces
collapsed, the deﬂation was time consuming. To overcome
the slow deﬂation and collapse the actuators to their original
heights, we applied vacuum in the demonstration shown in
Figure 4C.
We mounted a paper-based gripper onto the platform of a
manipulator (see Supplementary Video S3 in Supplemental
Data). We used three solenoid valves to control the manip-
ulator and one valve to control the gripper. To speed up the

collapse of folding patterns, we connected the inlets to a vac-
uum pump with a pressure of -88.3 kPa and kept the pump on
during the whole demonstration. We increased the pressure
of compressed air to 103 kPa to neutralize the suction of
the continuously applied vacuum. As shown in Figure 4C, the
manipulator bent to the left for a Ping-Pong ball, grasped the
ball, bent to the right, and dropped the ball in a container. This
demonstration shows that the manipulator was capable of
performing a pick-and-place operation.
Design and demonstration of a legged locomotor
The second application is a legged locomotor with four
feet (Fig. 5). We attached feet on both ends of the Left and
Right Actuators. On the bottom of each foot, we attached a
rubber ﬁlm of Mold Star 30 (Smooth-On, Inc.) and used a
piece of tape (Gorilla Heavy Duty Packing Tape) to cover
the front half of the attached rubber ﬁlm. Qualitatively, the
tape had a lower coefﬁcient of friction than the exposed
rubber ﬁlm.
As shown in Figure 5A, the locomotor consists of two
parallel actuators: the Left Actuator and the Right Actuator.
Each actuator consists of two rotatable PBAs with mir-
rored symmetry in series (Fig. 5A). During inﬂation, the
actuators elongate and transition to placing the attached feet
on both ends ﬂush against the ground. During deﬂation,
the actuators contract and transition to placing the attached
feet on both ends into a tilted conﬁguration. By alternat-
ing the inﬂation and deﬂation of the Left and Right actua-
tors, the translation, rocking, and tilting motions of the feet
result in forward motion. The portions of the rubbery feet
making contact with the ground keep the robot from moving
backward.
In the demonstration, we powered the locomotor through
pneumatic tubes (Fig. 5B). Two airlines connected to the Left
and Right Actuators for inﬂation and deﬂation; three airlines
connected to two solenoid valves for compressed air and a
vacuum pump for negative pressure. In this setup, the applied
vacuum increased the rate of deﬂation of the Left/Right
Actuators, which permitted fast cycling between inﬂation

and deﬂation to increase the speed of walking. To track the
position of the locomotor, we attached a piece of red tape to
the top of the framework and extracted the position of the red
tape through image processing.
We tested the locomotor in three cases. In the ﬁrst case,
a support stand held one end of pneumatic lines above the
table, and we used vacuum to deﬂate the actuators. In the
second case, a support stand held one end of pneumatic
lines above the table, but we did not use vacuum. In the
third case, there was no support stand to hold the pneumatic
lines above the table, and we did not use vacuum. Supple-
mentary Figure S5 shows the conﬁguration of a support
stand for holding pneumatic lines. As shown in Supple-
mentary Video S4 in the Supplementary Data, the loco-
motor in the ﬁrst case walked 11 cm in 20 s (Fig. 5B).
Figure 5C shows the relationship between time and the
position of the locomotor in each case. The average ve-
locity was 5.2, 2.9, and 1.7 mm/s in the ﬁrst, second, and

third cases, respectively. In the ﬁrst case, the average ve-
locity of the locomotor was close to 7 mm/s in the ﬁrst 10 s.
As the locomotor walked away from the support holding
the tubes, the amount of tubing that dragged on the table
increased, which resulted in a reduced walking speed.
Overall, robotic systems consisting of PBAs in series and
parallel can implement complex motions, although a sin-
gle PBA can only elongate and rotate.
Discussion
This work provides a unique method of designing origami
robots made of paper-like materials. We stacked PBAs
to implement a series of speciﬁc and complex motions. To
understand the mechanical performance of PBAs, we exper-
imentally characterized the actuators and numerically simu-
lated their inﬂation. The experimental results suggest that the
power-to-mass ratio of a PBA is more than four times that of
human muscle. The simulated results of the numerical model
matched well with the experimental data. The model has the
potential to guide the design of origami actuators made of
paper or other thin-sheet materials. Two robotic systems il-
lustrated potential applications of these stackable actuators.
These paper-based robots with highly deformable structures
showed similar properties to elastomer-based robots, even
though paper is not stretchable.60 Similarities include: (1) an
underactuated gripper that adapts to the shape of its targeted
objects; (2) a manipulator that exhibits tentacle-like behav-
ior; and (3) a locomotor that moves like earthworms, which
extend/contract their body when moving forward. This study
may have an impact on the structural design and choice of
materials for compliant robots.
Furthermore, these robots are lightweight, low cost, and
recyclable. In the future, paper-based manipulators have the
potential to transfer and manipulate lightweight and fragile
objects, such as medical/biomedical samples in health care
facilities. The primary material of the robot is paper so that
users can recycle or burn them for sterilization after use. In
addition, paper-based locomotors have the potential to in-
spect unstructured quarters and transport tether-like pay-
loads, such as signal wires and ﬂexible tubing. A robot with
folded components may also be capable of navigating chan-
nels, cavities, or chambers with narrow cross-sectional
regions. The low-cost and accessible nature of paper may
facilitate the use of paper-based robotics for educational
demonstrations and learning in the classroom.
Finally, this approach for assembling actuators is appli-
cable to origami robots made of materials other than paper.
Nonetheless, cellulose-based paper is suitable for prototyping
robots or educational purposes, but this type of paper may be
inappropriate for applications that require high power or need
to be airtight. Plastic sheets are alternatives, which have been
widely used in origami/kirigami structures.17,21,26,41,61,62
In the future, the application of origami robots may require
the development of new polymer-based materials. As a
functional requirement, the material should be foldable like
paper because origami actuators require high ﬂexibility at
the creases of folding patterns. The material should also re-
sist damage due to fatigue and fracture, especially at tight
folds or vertices. Addressing these issues would potentially
enable new origami-based robots for commercial and house-
hold use.
