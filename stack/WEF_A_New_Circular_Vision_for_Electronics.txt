A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
Foreword
We have come together as the heads of UN agencies with the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development to address a severe global challenge while also simultaneously grasping a massive opportunity. 
Electronic goods, from solar mini grids to smartphones, bring huge benefits to humankind and offer new opportunities for 
development. They present new tools to address the challenges of climate change, expand education, deliver healthcare 
and facilitate trade. Digitalization and connectivity are also critical to help achieve all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 
At the same time, the current system of production and consumption is ready for a reboot. In the mining, manufacturing, 
transport, retail, consumption and disposal of electronics, there are vast amounts of wasted resources and the system 
has several negative impacts. Each year, approximately 50 million tonnes of electronic and electrical waste (e-waste) are 
produced, equivalent in weight to all commercial aircraft ever built; only 20% is formally recycled. If nothing is done, the 
amount of waste will more than double by 2050, to 120 million tonnes annually.
When it is not being stored in cellars, drawers and cabinets, e-waste is often incinerated or dumped in landfills, or makes its way 
around the world to be pulled apart by hand or burned by the world’s poorest, to the detriment of health and the environment. 
That same e-waste represents a huge opportunity. The material value alone is worth $62.5 billion (€55 billion), three times 
more than the annual output of the world’s silver mines and more than the GDP of most countries. There is 100 times 
more gold in a tonne of mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore. Furthermore, harvesting the resources from used 
electronics produces substantially less carbon-dioxide emissions than mining in the earth’s crust. Working electronic goods 
and components are worth more than the materials they contain. Therefore, extending the life of products and re-using 
components brings an even larger economic benefit. 
There is also an opportunity to build a more circular electronics system, one in which resources are not extracted, used and 
wasted, but valued and re-used in ways that create decent, sustainable jobs. In short, we need a new vision for electronics. 
This report combines data and research from throughout the UN system to make the case for a new vision. Describing and 
analysing challenges and opportunities, and laying the groundwork for the process of systemic change is just the first step. 
To make this happen, the following are required:
 
––
Vision: Society needs to collectively rethink the rules of the game and create a vision around which government, 
consumers and industry can rally 
––
Awareness: The public needs to learn more about this growing global challenge and opportunity 
––
Collaboration: This coalition seeks to work with multinationals, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), entrepreneurs, 
employers’ associations, academia, trade unions, civil society and associations in a specific and deliberative process to 
bring about change. Public-private collaborations through platforms such as PACE and the E-waste Coalition will play an 
important role
––
Action: Coordinated action by all actors is needed within and across national borders

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
Rapid innovation and lowering costs have dramatically 
increased access to electronic products and digital 
technology, with many benefits. This has led to an increase 
in the use of electronic devices and equipment. The 
unintended consequence of this is a ballooning of electronic 
and electrical waste: e-waste.
It is difficult to gauge how many electrical goods are 
produced annually, but just taking account of devices 
connected to the internet, they now number many more 
than humans. By 2020, this is projected to be between 25-
50 billion,1,2 reflecting plummeting costs and rising demand. 
E-waste is now the fastest-growing waste stream in the 
world.3 Some forms of it have been growing exponentially.4 
The UN has called it a tsunami of e-waste.5,6 It is estimated 
this waste stream reached 50 million tonnes in 2018.7 This 
figure is expected to double if nothing changes.8 Globally, 
society only deals with 20%9 of e-waste appropriately and 
there is little data on what happens to the rest, which for the 
most part ends up in landfill, or is disposed of by informal 
workers in poor conditions.
Yet e-waste is worth at least $62.5 billion10 annually, which 
is more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of most 
countries. In fact, if e-waste was a single nation, it’s GDP 
would be on a par with that of Kenya. Furthermore, 123 
countries have less GDP than the global pile of electronic 
waste.11 In the right hands, however, it could be worth 
considerably more. 
Changes in technology such as cloud computing and 
the internet of things (IoT) could hold the potential to 
“dematerialize” the electronics industry. The rise of service 
business models and better product tracking and take-
back could lead to global circular value chains. Material 
efficiency, recycling infrastructure and scaling up the volume 
and quality of recycled materials to meet the needs of 
electronics supply chains will all be essential. If the sector is 
supported with the right policy mix and managed in the right 
way, it could lead to the creation of millions of decent jobs 
worldwide.  
A new vision for the production and consumption of 
electronic and electrical goods is needed. It is easy for 
e-waste to be framed as a post-consumer problem, but the 
issue encompasses the lifecycle of the devices everyone 
uses. Designers, manufacturers, investors, traders, miners, 
raw material producers, consumers, policy-makers and 
others have a crucial role to play in reducing waste, retaining 
value within the system, extending the economic and 
physical life of an item, as well as its ability to be repaired, 
recycled and reused. The possibilities are endless. 
This is an inflection point in history and represents an 
unparalleled opportunity for global businesses, policy-
makers and workers worldwide. Those who can rethink 
the value chain for electronic goods and prioritize 
dematerialization and closed loop systems (which means 
reducing reliance on primary resources), could have an 
incredible advantage. Innovative products and services do 
not have to mean more e-waste; they can mean a lot less. 
The prevailing “take, make and dispose” model has 
consequences for society, a negative impact on health 
and contributes to climate change.12 It is time for a system 
update. We need a system that functions properly – in 
which the circular economy replaces the linear. 
In the short-term, electronic waste remains a largely unused, 
yet growing, valuable resource. Nearly all of it could be 
recycled. Urban mining, where resources are extracted from 
complex waste streams, can now be more economically 
viable than extracting metal ores from the ground. It is 
largely less energy intensive. E-waste can be toxic, is not 
biodegradable and accumulates in the environment, in the 
soil, air, water and living things. It can also have an adverse 
impact on health. Children and women are particularly 
vulnerable to the health risks of e-waste exposure.13  
It is time to reconsider e-waste, re-evaluate the electronics 
industry and reboot the system for the benefit of 
industry, consumer, worker, health of humankind and the 
environment. The incredible opportunities here are also 
aligned to the globe’s “just transition” to environmental 
sustainability and to shaping a future that works for all in the 
circular economy.
Executive Summary

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
E-waste is defined as anything with a plug, electric cord 
or battery (including electrical and electronic equipment) 
from toasters to toothbrushes, smartphones, fridges, 
laptops and LED televisions that has reached the end of its 
life, as well as the components that make up these end-
of-life products. E-waste is also called waste electrical or 
electronic equipment, or WEEE for short.14 Currently, only a 
few countries have a uniform way of measuring this waste. 
E-waste comes from many sources including households, 
businesses and governments.
E-waste defined
E-waste may contain precious metals such as gold, copper 
and nickel as well as rare materials of strategic value such 
as indium and palladium. A lot of these metals could be 
recovered, recycled and used as secondary raw materials 
for new goods. The challenge is the incredible complexity 
of doing this; a product can be made up of more than 
1,000 different substances.15 E-waste may represent only 
2% of solid waste streams, yet it can represent 70% of 
the hazardous waste that ends up in landfill.16,17 Up to 60 
elements from the periodic table can be found in complex 
electronics,18 such as smartphones, with many being 
technically recoverable.

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
According to the Global E-waste Monitor 2017, in one 
year, a staggering 44.7 million metric tonnes of e-waste 
are generated. This is equivalent to just over six kilograms 
for every person on the planet. Europe and the US alone 
contribute to almost one-half of the total e-waste generated 
annually.19 
One-half of all e-waste is personal devices, such as 
computers, screens, smartphones, tablets and TVs, and 
the rest is larger household appliances, as well as heating 
and cooling equipment. The scale of global e-waste defies 
comparison, yet the weight is more than all the commercial 
aircraft ever produced. Imagine the mass of 125,000 jumbo 
jets20 – it would take London’s Heathrow Airport up to six 
months to clear that many aircraft from its runways. If you 
find that difficult to envisage, then try the mass of 4,500 
Eiffel Towers, jam them all in one space, side by side, and 
they would cover an area the size of Manhattan.
Of this total amount, 40 million tonnes of e-waste are 
discarded in landfill,21 burned or illegally traded and treated 
in a sub-standard way every year.

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
It is hard to forecast the volumes of e-waste that will be 
generated, but by 2021 the annual total volume is expected 
to surpass 52 million tonnes.22 There are other indications 
that there will be a growth in the usage of electronic and 
electrical devices. For instance, forecasts put the number 
of devices connected to the internet at between 25-50 
billion by 2020,23 which is nearly triple the number of people 
on the planet today, all of these devices will have an end-
of-life point. Most of the growth is coming from emerging 
regions, which are increasingly joining the connected global 
economy.
By 2040, carbon emissions from the production and use of 
electronics, including devices like PCs, laptops, monitors, 
smartphones and tablets (and their production) will reach 
14% of total emissions.24,25 This is one-half that of the total 
global transport sector today. By 2050, the volume of 
e-waste, in the worst-case scenario, could top 120 million 
tonnes annually, according to estimations from the United 
Nations University in Vienna.26 According to the Organisation 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), by 
2060, the world’s consumption of raw materials is set to 
double.27
   
E-waste today often consists of products from the 
past. Think of the millions of cathode ray tubes from old 
televisions and computer monitors, VHS tapes and DVD 
players, many with toxic compounds, such as lead, still 
making them hazardous and problematic. There is a trail of 
e-waste generated from old technology that needs to be 
addressed.

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
There are concerns about the availability and supply of new 
materials for electronics and electrical devices in the future. 
Rising commodity prices have highlighted risks. Yet e-waste 
contains many high-value and scarce materials, such as 
gold, platinum, cobalt, rare earths, and high quantities of 
aluminium and tin. There are many opportunities for better 
recovery.
It is uncommon to throw away gold, silver or platinum 
jewellery, but that is not true of electronic and electrical 
goods containing the same precious metals; up to 7% of the 
world’s gold may currently be contained in e-waste.28   
The improper handling of e-waste is resulting in a significant 
loss of scarce and valuable raw materials, including such 
precious metals as neodymium (vital for magnets in motors), 
indium (used in flat panel TVs) and cobalt (for batteries). 
Almost no rare earth minerals are extracted from informal 
recycling; these are polluting to mine.
Yet metals in e-waste are difficult to extract; for example, 
total recovery rates for cobalt are only 30% (despite 
technology existing that could recycle 95%).29 The metal 
is, however, in great demand for laptop, smartphone and 
electric car batteries. Recycled metals are also two to 10 
times more energy efficient than metals smelted from virgin 
ore. Furthermore, mining discarded electronics produces 
80% less emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of gold 
compared with mining it from the ground.30
In 2015, the extraction of raw materials accounted for 
7% of the world’s energy consumption.31 This means that 
moving towards the use of more secondary raw materials 
in electronic goods could help considerably in reaching the 
targets set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change.
Resource scarcity, extraction and emissions
Batteries: An electrifying issue
Like other components of modern electronics, batteries 
are everywhere. Nearly all portable and movable pieces 
of technology use them – from hearing aids and toys, 
to electric vehicles and smartphones. Yet they are not 
counted in global e-waste flows. Batteries normally 
contain one or more of the following nine metals: lithium, 
cobalt, cadmium, lead, zinc, manganese, nickel, silver or 
mercury.
The lithium-ion battery market, the fastest-growing 
segment, is forecast to reach $100 billion by 2025.32 
Batteries are dropping in cost and demand is rising, 
driven by demand from smartphone and electric vehicle 
usage. By 2030, there could be up to 125 million electric 
vehicles on the road, up from 3 million in 2018, ushering 
in a green transport revolution.33 Currently, the global 
recycling rate for this market is only 42%.34 By 2025, the 
weight of lithium-ion batteries being sold each year will 
increase five-fold to nearly 5 million tonnes.35
Electric vehicle batteries often contain as much lithium 
as 1,000 smartphones. The EU and People’s Republic 
of China have introduced laws making carmakers 
responsible for recycling batteries. There is also the 
potential for a large market for second-life batteries; 
renewable energy grids of the future will need vast 
amount of storage, which could be filled by batteries that 
are too old for cars, but good for static uses.
 
Over 11 million tonnes of used lithium-ion batteries 
are forecast to be discarded by 2030, representing a 
significant challenge,36,37 but also an opportunity given the 
dramatic rise in demand for materials such as lithium is 
and cobalt by 11 times.38
In electronics, device collection remains critical and, as 
with all components, will be important for the increased 
collection of batteries for recycling. When a battery 
has reached the end of its life it will be essential to 
ensure those batteries are destined for best-in-class 
recyclers who have the technology to recover the key 
raw materials. This can be helped by linking services to 
replace batteries with recyclers and ensuring batteries are 
not disposed of inappropriately.
One of the most important materials for battery 
production is cobalt, yet two-thirds of the world’s cobalt 
is found in one of the world’s poorest countries, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). About 90% of 
the cobalt produced in DRC, originates from large-scale 
and mechanized mining operations. However, 10% is 
estimated to originate from small-scale mining, often in 
dangerous working conditions. Amnesty international has 
reported that child labour is widespread in this informal 
sector.39 
Efforts are under way to address these challenges, which 
span the lifecycle and value chain of battery technology. 
Notably, the Global Battery Alliance is a public-private 
partnership and collaboration platform, which seeks to 
provide a platform to accelerate these efforts and build a 
sustainable value chain for batteries. 
Growing PV solar panel usage and the subsequent 
e-waste it produces, presents a similar environmental 
challenge, but also unprecedented opportunities to create 
value and nurture new end-of-life industries.40

A system error
Consumer relationships with electronics
Like fast fashion and fast food, electronics can involve a 
rapid turnover in style trends, with revenues dependent on 
selling the latest products, which are increasingly affordable. 
In particular, affordability has opened up opportunities 
in developing countries, for instance mobile money has 
dramatically increased financial inclusion and given rise to 
other developmental opportunities. In many cases, second-
hand device markets flourish in these countries with products 
such as laptops and smartphones having second or third 
lives. Yet eventually all these smartphones, tablets, cameras 
and home gadgets or appliances will become waste. 
One report puts the global consumer electronics market at 
around $1.1 trillion in 2017, growing at a rate of 6% until 
2024, when it will be worth $1.7 trillion.41 Rising smartphone 
adoption rates are fuelling global demand. There is also 
a major trend towards flat panel TV screens in developed 
markets and adoption of 3G and 4G in developing 
economies; electric vehicles are also on the rise. More 
clothes, furniture, toys, sports equipment and toothbrushes 
have complex electronic components.
Lack of recycling
Recycling rates globally are low. Even in the EU, which 
leads the world in e-waste recycling, just 35% of e-waste 
is officially reported as properly collected and recycled.42 
Globally, the average is 20%; the remaining 80% is 
undocumented, with much ending up buried under 
the ground for centuries as landfill.43 E-waste is not

biodegradable. The lack of recycling weighs heavily on the 
global electronic industry and as devices become more 
numerous, smaller and more complex, the issue escalates.
Currently, recycling some types of e-waste and recovering 
materials and metals is an expensive process. The remaining 
mass of e-waste – mainly plastics laced with metals and 
chemicals – poses a more intractable problem. The waste 
stream is complex, containing up to 60 elements from 
the periodic table. In some cases, it contains hazardous 
chemicals, such as flame retardants, of which some are 
Persistent Organic Pollutants listed under the Stockholm 
Convention.
There is also confusion in global consumers’ minds in terms 
of how they handle e-waste because the system is often 
complex. In many cases, it is treated as normal household 
waste, but it must be separated. Different streams of 
e-waste must also be dealt with separately, including 
batteries, light bulbs, smartphones, cables or computers.
This lack of awareness about how to recycle and worries 
about data security mean there are vast tranches of 
residual electronics sitting in drawers, garages, bedrooms 
and offices across the globe waiting to be dealt with. An 
opportunity in waiting.
Labour, environmental and health issues
From lead-lined, cathode ray tubes from old TVs, to lead 
and chromium in circuit boards, e-waste can contain 
substances that are hazardous to human health if not 
dealt with properly, including mercury, cadmium and lead. 
E-waste can pollute water sources and food supply chains. 
This is particularly true of older products making up today’s 
e-waste. Regulation and some voluntary targets are driving 
the phase out of some of the worst offenders in new 
products. 
Recycling of valuable elements contained in e-waste, such 
as copper and gold, has become a source of income, 
mostly in the informal sector of developing countries. 
However, basic recycling techniques to burn the plastic from 
electronic goods leaving the valuable metals (melting down 
lead in open pots, or dissolving circuit boards in acid) lead to 
adult and child workers, as well as their families, exposed to 
many toxic substances. 
In many countries, women and children make up to 30% 
of the workforce in informal, crude e-waste processing and 
are therefore particularly vulnerable.44 When the mothers 
of tomorrow are exposed to toxic compounds, there are 
also potential issues.45 Findings from many studies show 
increases in spontaneous miscarriages, still and premature 
births, as well as reduced birthweights and birth lengths 
associated with exposure to e-waste. Workers also suffer 
high incidences of birth defects and infant mortality. E-waste 
compounds are also carcinogenic. Toxic elements are 
found in the blood streams of informal workers at dumping 
grounds for e-waste where open burning is used to harvest 
metals. These dumps have become economic hubs in their 
own right, attracting food vendors, and are often adjacent to 
informal settlements, leading to further contamination from 
the toxic fumes. E-waste can contaminate groundwater, soil 
and air.46
Today, the total number of people working informally in 
the global e-waste sector is unknown. However, as an 
indication, according to the ILO in Nigeria up 100,000 
people are thought to be working in the informal e-waste 
sector, while in China that number is thought to be 
690,000.47 The upgrade and formalization of the industry to 
one where formal recycling plants provide safe, decent work 
for thousands of workers is a major opportunity.
It is also worth considering the effects electronic goods 
have on climate change. Every device ever produced has 
a carbon footprint and is contributing to human-made 
global warming. Manufacture a tonne of laptops and 
potentially 10 tonnes of CO2 are emitted. When the carbon 
dioxide released over a device’s lifetime is considered, it 
predominantly occurs during production, before consumers 
buy a product. This makes lower carbon processes and 
inputs at the manufacturing stage (such as use recycled raw 
materials) and product lifetime key determinants of overall 
environmental impact.48
Legislation on e-waste
A total of 67 countries have legislation in place to deal with 
the e-waste they generate. This normally takes the form of 
Extended Producer Responsibility, when a small charge on 
new electronic devices subsidizes end-of-life collection and 
recycling. The legislation covers about two-thirds of the global 
population.49 However, many countries do not have national 
legislation on e-waste. In many regions of Africa, Latin 
America or South-East Asia, electronic waste is not always 
high on the political agenda, and often not well enforced. 
When it comes to the export of e-waste to developing 
countries, it is regulated under the Basel Convention on 
the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous 
Wastes and Their Disposal, which has been ratified by 188 
countries, other similar conventions exist at a regional level.50 
Even with the convention in place, however, large amounts 
of e-waste continue to be shipped illegally. The difference 
in enforcement of conventions and transposing e-waste 
legislation globally means the regulatory environment can be 
complex and fragmented.51 

14
A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
Australia, China, the EU, Japan, North America and the 
Republic of Korea produce most of the world’s e-waste. 
In the United States and Canada, every person produces 
roughly 20kg of e-waste annually, while in the EU the figure 
stands at 17.7kg. Yet the 1.2 billion inhabitants of the 
African continent each generated an average of just 1.9kg of 
electronic waste.52
In total, 1.3 million tonnes of discarded electronic products 
are exported from the EU in an undocumented way every 
year. The illegal movement of e-waste from developed 
countries to developing countries is a major global 
challenge.53 There is a complex web of trans-shipment ports 
so that e-waste avoids detection by authorities. 
At the same time, shipments of secondary materials from 
consumer countries to centres of production with the 
intention of re-integrating materials into new products 
would benefit from clear international definitions on 
secondary materials. Shipments of used products for repair, 
refurbishment or direct re-use are subject to legislative 
uncertainties.

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
There is a lot of economic value in e-waste, particularly 
from such materials as gold, silver, copper, platinum and 
palladium, among others. There is 100 times more gold in 
a tonne of smartphones than in a tonne of gold ore. The 
earth’s richest deposits of valuable materials are sitting in 
landfill sites or people’s homes. More needs to be made of 
these resources. 
Looking at the market for smartphones, 1.46 billion were 
sold in 2017.54 At retail, each unit contains electrical 
components worth more than $100.49 This represents a 
lot of value entering the market each year. If just the raw 
materials are recycled, they could be worth up to $11.5 
billion.55 The latest forecasts show that e-waste is worth 
$62.5 billion annually, which is more than the GDP of most 
countries. It is also worth three times the output of all the 
world’s silver mines. 
A more effective use of products is a second life, which 
keeps the materials at a higher value. Global markets for 
second lives of smartphones are well developed, particularly 
at the top end of the market. There is, however, significant 
room for improvement. 
In 2016 alone, 435,000 tonnes of phones were discarded,56 
despite containing billions of dollars’ worth of materials.
To capture this opportunity, it will be important to move 
towards a circular economy for electronics.
The economic value of e-waste

A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
A system upgrade: Change to the circular 
economy
A circular economy is a system in which all materials and 
components are kept at their highest value at all times, 
and waste is designed out of the system. It can easily be 
thought of as the opposite of today’s linear economy. It can 
be achieved through different business models including 
product as a service, sharing of assets, life extension and 
finally recycling. To build a circular economy for electronics 
there are different aspects to consider. 
Design 
Products need to be designed for reuse, durability and 
eventually safe recycling. Many companies have made 
global commitments to designing waste out of the 
electronics value chain and others have worked hard to 
design hazardous materials out of their products. These 
kinds of experiences must be shared across the industry, 
creating a pre-competitive, open-source space for 
collaboration.
Embracing durable designs can ensure that electronic 
devices are kept in circulation for longer. Configurations 
should have a product’s end-of-life in mind, as well as 
encouraging disassembly and reuse. Taking a “systems 
approach” and redesigning the entire electronic device 
lifecycle for a circular economy could also create more value 
in the system.

Electronics as a service?
Once there were vinyl records, then tapes and CDs. 
Our electronics devices have now have subscription-
based streaming apps. VHS, DVDs and Blu-ray discs 
disappeared with the advent of Netflix. Some people 
use taxi haling apps instead of buying a car or stay in 
someone’s spare room through Airbnb meaning less 
hotels are needed to cover peak times.57 These are 
all now services that were once only sold as physical 
products.
 
The process is called dematerialization and is happening 
in many aspects of people’s lives. In the Netherlands, 
Signify (formerly Philips Lighting) sells lighting as a service, 
and in the UK, Rolls Royce sells aeroplane engine time 
rather than jet engines. These are examples of electronics 
as a service.
Current leasing and rental models, with monthly contracts 
say for smartphones and even some televisions, allow 
global consumers to access the latest technology, 
particularly products with short lifespans and without 
high up-front costs. Access to innovation and upgrades 
continues unabated, while barriers to usership have also 
lowered. 
With this new ownership model, the manufacturer has 
an incentive to ensure that all the resources are used 
optimally over a device’s lifecycle. This includes when it is 
time to be reused by another consumer or recycled. For 
this to work, however, it is vital that products are kept as 
services until their last use, or they risk being sold and 
falling into the informal sector. There is also an incentive 
to keep the value in products for as long as possible, 
extend the life of devices, repair them when necessary, 
eliminate waste and reduce the impact that electronic 
products have on the environment.
Instead of a one-off transaction, the business model 
shifts to one of an ongoing service, and the subscription 
economy. This builds a much closer and stronger 
customer relationship. This has already occurred with 
household modems in some countries. For example, 
Fairphone, a circular mobile phone company in the 
Netherlands, has launched “Fairphone-as-a-Service”58 
and Dell in the US already has “PC as a Service”.59,60
As outlined in a recent report by the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation, the rise of cloud computing also has 
incredible potential when it comes to electronics. By 
moving the capability of devices away from the actual 
hardware purchased and into remote data centres, 
hardware capabilities become less important than 
connectivity and services. In turn, this could increase 
product use cycles and decrease waste in the system.61
Buy-back or return systems 
Increasingly producers of electronics could offer buy-back 
or return systems for old equipment. Incentivizing the 
consumer financially and guaranteeing their data will be 
properly handled. Expertise in user experience could be 
employed to make the end-of-life process smoother. 
Advanced recycling and recapturing
Companies and governments could work towards creating a 
system for closed-loop production in which all old products 
are collected and then the materials or components re-
integrated into new ones. This will take new financial 
incentives and policy levers as well as private-sector 
leadership. The recycling sector will also need an upgrade; 
in some cases, recycled materials are not of sufficient quality 
for use in new electronic products. Countries also have 
targets related to this. In China, there is a target for 20% 
recycled content in all new products by 2025. 
Durability and repair
Post-consumer recycling of electrical and electronic goods 
will not be enough to combat the issue. Society must be 
able to benefit from well designed, long-living products. 
Longevity can be further increased when equipment is 
maintained, repaired, and refurbished. Companies should be 
ready to repair equipment they sell, something that has also 
been mandated by law in some jurisdictions. Second-hand 
electrical goods are worth more than individual components, 
which again are worth an order of magnitude more than 
the materials alone. Therefore, second use and harvesting 
components represent a major opportunity.
Urban mining 
It is time for companies to start investing heavily around the 
globe in technology that can help extract metals and minerals 
from e-waste. Already one recycler in China produces more 
cobalt than the country mines in one year. A circular economy 
for electronics would maximize the amount of valuable 
e-waste that moves back into the production of new electronic 
products and components. To get there, more countries, 
especially those in the developing world, will need to adopt 
e-waste legislation, such as extended producer responsibility 
and build a formal recycling industry. Not only will this mitigate 
some of the worst effects, but it will also create a huge 
opportunity for economic growth and decent work.
Reverse logistics
When a product can no longer be used, the materials will 
need to be collected and sent back to be reintegrated 
into production. This is known as a reverse supply chain. 
Unlike a forward supply chain, however, the movement and 
processing of materials are not subsidized by the value of a 
finished product laden with features. Instead they must rely 
on the value of the raw materials only and therefore demand 
a highly efficient and economical reverse supply chain model 
that is safe and responsible, and ensures materials do not 
flow into the informal sector. 

18
A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
Economic benefit and job creation
The economic benefits of employing a circular economic 
model in the electronics and electrical sector could be 
enormous. A circular model for electronics could reduce the 
costs for consumers by 7% by 2030 and 14% by 2040.62
Since e-waste is a growing resource and given resource 
scarcity and price fluctuations for some metals and minerals 
on the horizon, there is a growing economic case for the 
recovery of these precious resources. This, combined with 
better designs and technology for resource recovery, will 
produce more profitable yields of materials, reinforcing the 
case.
  
In many countries, e-waste entrepreneurs and cooperatives 
of e-waste workers are expanding e-waste recycling 
operations and experimenting with new and inclusive 
business models for managing e-waste effectively. These 
have already generated thousands of decent jobs in safe 
conditions for what were formerly informal workers in the 
e-waste value chain. With the right policy mix and access to 
finance, such approaches could be expanded and scaled 
up, generating additional jobs for tens if not hundreds of 
thousands of workers in the circular economy.
If developed in the right way, employing a circular economy 
for the electronics and e-waste sector could create 
millions of jobs worldwide. Some may be in low-paid and 
low-skilled work as more e-waste is reclaimed into the 
system, but over time, this will change with a wide range 
of job opportunities emerging. This will give rise to the 
need for instance new designers, circular economists and 
urban mine specialists and EaaS (electronics as a service) 
officers. The future is bright.

19
A New Circular Vision for Electronics: Time for a Global Reboot
Conclusion
This is an initial explainer on the challenge and opportunity of materials within the electronics and 
electrical equipment industry. It sets the framing for why the time has come for a global reboot of the 
electronics system and why we need a new vision for circular electronics. It is based on existing data 
and expert input. The paper starts to explore some of the levers that may play a part in that vision, but 
far more work is needed to collaborate with all the relevant players in the value chain and jointly create 
a vision. In turn, this can act as a map to transform the industry from one characterized by waste and 
a number of negative externalities, to one based on a circular economy. 
The transition to a circular economy must take place in a way that benefits all stakeholders from the 
consumer to workers, government, businesses, entrepreneurs and society at large. There will be a 
need for mass collaboration, system changing ideas, new policy frameworks and new ways of doing 
business. The organizations involved in this work have a shared commitment to achieve this and invite 
others to join in this important endeavour.
