There are many conflicting definitions of science, therefore, a framework focusing on the key 
characteristics identified by Berezow (2012) will be used to structure the argument that psychology is 
far from unscientific. Berezow’s characteristics are used as a representation of the draconian 
expectations of research in some sciences, rather than from psychology’s perspective. These 
characteristics include: clarity of definitions, quantifiability, highly controlled conditions and the 
ability to reproduce experiments, predictability and testability (Berezow, 2012). To evidence that 
psychology is a leader in the promotion of scientific values, the American Psychological Associations 
(APA) code of ethics (American Psychological Association, 2019d), and the Universal Declaration of 
Ethical Principles for Psychologists (International Union of Psychological Science, 2013) will be 
analysed and compared in terms of progressiveness, and content, to codes of ethics and conduct in 
the largest specific scientific associations in Chemistry (American Chemical Society, 2018a) and 
Physics (German Physical Society, 2019b). A summary and conclusion will show that far from being 
unscientific, psychology is, in fact, a leader in the promotion of scientific values.  
Berezow (2012) argues that vague concepts explored in psychology fail to meet the requirement of 
clearly defined terminology and that definitions change geographically, culturally and over time. To 
add to this dilemma, separation of concepts such as behaviour and emotion is impossible, therefore, 
they cannot be measured independently (Smedslund, 2002; Bond & Dryden, 1996). Quantifiability 
requires established, precise units of measure (Kline, 1998). Without proof demonstrating that 
variables such as empathy are quantitative, measurement may be more of a rough guess (Coombs, 
Daws, & Tversky, 1970). Testability of hypotheses containing these abstract concepts may, therefore, 
not be possible. However, psychology makes a presumption that its concepts are quantifiable and 
therefore measurable (Thorndike, 2010), and uses operationalisation to define them (Campbell, 
1920). Psychology has a unique interpretation of measurement (Michell, 1997). However, Howard 
(1991) argues that experiments that test hypotheses that are assumed accurate are beneficial and 
scientific since their outcomes can serve as a basis for further, more accurate investigations.

Therefore, despite its difficulties establishing measurement psychology can still regarded as a science 
(Rakover, 2012). Psychology’s interpretation of measurement presents an opportunity for novelty in 
experiments not seen in other sciences. The scientific value of novelty (Erduran & Dagher, 2014) is a 
component of creativity (Lee, Walsh, & Wang, 2015). Creative research crosses boundaries into the 
unknown (Newman & Cooper, 1993; Schoenmakers & Duysters, 2010). The definition of 
measurement in psychology additionally permits investigation into areas that address human needs, 
a social scientific value recognised by Erduran and Dagher (2014) and in APA’s code of ethics. Diener 
and Chan (2011), audited 160 psychological studies that utilised operationalisation to define their 
measurements and discovered clear and convincing evidence that subjective well-being causally 
affects health and longevity. Findings like these may result in the revision of current health 
recommendations leading to improved quality of life, therefore, addressing human needs (Erduran & 
Dagher, 2014).  
Berezow’s scientific characteristic of predictability is hard to accomplish in psychology, on account of 
the multifariousness of human behaviour. Psychology cannot foresee human behaviour with 100% 
accuracy as Individuals and each of their actions are unique (Wolman, 1965). However, it can 
determine if a particular stimulus is an indicator of particular human behaviour which allows it to 
retain its status as a science. Song, Qu, Blumm, and Barabási (2010) demonstrated this in their 
investigation into human dynamics where they established a potential 93% average predictability in 
human behaviour. This kind of research can address human needs (Erduran & Dagher, 2014), for 
instance, in helping develop software used to track movement patterns after natural disasters, thus 
helping emergency personnel determine where to go first (Song, et al., 2017).  
The ability to effectively repeat a research procedure, otherwise known as reproducibility, does not 
invalidate research, rather it can be seen as an interrogation into their variation (Leonelli, 2018). The 
highly controlled conditions that are required for reproducibility can create artificiality in 

Lina Teresa Lane                                              Introduction to Perspectives in Psychology

experiments that can lead to results which may not honestly reflect human behaviour (Staddon, 
2018). Observation in real-life situations may be more accurate. Many psychological experiments 
cannot meet the highly controlled conditions or reproducibility asserted by Berezow (2012). Instead, 
great thought, planning and analysis are applied to procedural methods, a scientific approach that 
has enabled psychology to improve data reliability, and has increased accountability of research 
methods (Leonelli, 2018). These extra lengths that psychology goes to in order to study its complex 
subject matter are exactly what science is about. It is not about giving up when the going gets tough, 
rather it is about taking every step, including relaxing definitions of measurement and control over 
experimental conditions, to discover truths. In this way, psychology excels in science. As more 
relaxed controls in experiments may more accurately reflect human behaviour, experiments can be 
said to meet the social scientific values of honesty (Erduran & Dagher, 2014), and truthfulness which 
are core values in APA’s current ethical code (APA, 2019c). 
Berezow (2012) puts forth reasonable ideals of methodology in science to aspire to, even if they are 
not always realistically attainable. However, science also has a duty to consider the outcomes of its 
work (Kitcher, 2004). Ethical codes are intended for this purpose. Psychology's first code of ethics 
was introduced by APA in 1953 (Ford, 2006), 61 years after it was founded (Fernberger, 1932). This 
pioneering move highlighted moral principles and brought values to life in the scientific realm. In 
comparison the ethical codes of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the German Physical Society 
(DPG), and the American Physical Society (APS) were introduced respectively, 89, 153 and 92 years 
after they were founded (American Chemical Society, 2017a, 2017b; German Physical Society, 2007, 
2019a; American Physical Society, 2019a, 2019d). 
  
APA’s ethics code has advanced through progressive updates and amendments on average circa 
every 5.5 years (APA, 2019c; see Appendix A). It contains certain words, such as ‘reasonably’, which 
are open to interpretation (American Psychological Association, 2019d). This allows for flexibility to 
adapt to societal change (American Psychological Association, 2019d). This shows the APA’s

constructive nature in its approach to expanding values and instructing on ethics in a preventative 
manner. The same cannot be said for the ACS and APS, who have each updated their codes four 
times, and DGP who has made a change only once (American Chemical Society, 2017a; American 
Physical Society, 2019a; German Physical Society, 2008).  
 
APA’s 1953 ethics code incorporated the views within its association and of the wider science 
community (Stricker, 2010). The 1953 codes one hundred and seventy pages (Smith, 2003) give an 
indication of the comprehensiveness of its content. It has now been reduced to sixteen pages 
(American Psychological Association, 2019d) but can be seen as expansive when compared to the 
brief structures of the ACS, APS and DPG codes of conduct (American Chemical Society, 2017a; 
American Physical Society, 2019a; German Physical Society, 2008).  The vastness of APA’s code of 
ethics is due to its consideration of a great number of values (see Appendix B). This singles out 
Psychology as an innovator pushing boundaries to advance values. 
 
APA’s current 2002 ethics code was developed in a collaborative spirit similarly to its predecessors 
(Fisher, 2003). It consists of five principles and 10 ethical standards (see Appendix B; American 
Psychological Association, 2019d). These represent two separate approaches, informal and formal. 
An informal approach is aspirational and paves the way for leadership in promoting integrity in 
research (Resnik, 2012). The specificity of a formal approach permits enforceability and can aid the 
evolution of policies (Resnik, 2012). The ACS follow an informal code whereas the APS and DGP codes 
are purely formal in their design (American Chemical Society, 2017a; American Physical Society, 
2019a; German Physical Society, 2008). ACS suffer limitation in enforceability and lack clear guidance 
while APS and DGP lack aspirational goals and democratic ideals that encourage ethical behaviour. 
APA had the foresight to incorporate both informal and formal aspects into its code reinforcing both 
its credibility and enforceability (Fisher, 2003; Hobbs, 1948). In this way, APA has set a prime 
example for other scientific associations to follow.

Psychology leads the promotion of values on a global scale, with The Universal Declaration of Ethical 
Principles for Psychologists 2008 (Gauthier, Pettifor, & Ferrero, 2010; see Appendix C). It provides a 
structure of values that can be used as a basis to develop ethics codes (Gauthier, Pettifor, & Ferrero, 
2010). To create its framework, ethical codes from across the world, and from a variety of disciplines 
were examined for consistencies (Gauthier, 2004). The universal concepts were then incorporated 
(Gauthier, 2004). The Global Chemists Code of Ethics 2016 was established in one ACS workshop 
(American Chemical Society, 2018b; see Appendix C). Thirty scientists used the Hague Ethical 
Guidelines, a set of principles governing responsibility and misuse in chemistry, as a base for the code 
(American Chemical Society, 2018b). There is no universal set of principles for physics to date. This 
distinguishes psychology from other sciences. The depth of thought, early action, and effort it exerts 
has led to its pioneering status in the endeavour to promote scientific values.   
  
Instruction on ethics in both chemistry and physics is lacking (Strle, Bencin, Sumic-Riha, & Riha, 
2015). In 2004, APS Task Force on Ethics Education was created in response to an ethical scandal 
among physicists (American Physical Society, 2019b). Its mission was to advise on steps that could be 
taken to improve ethics education (American Physical Society, 2019b). Their report recommended 
the creation of online educational resources (American Physical Society, 2006). ACS Committee on 
Professional Training made similar recommendations in 2015 (American Chemical Society, 2015; 
American Chemical Society, 2019a). However, the lack of learning materials integrated into their 
website indicates that there is still much to be done (American Chemical Society, 2019b). American 
chemistry has no formal structure for education on ethics (Strle, Bencin, Sumic-Riha, & Riha, 2015). 
DPG offers no training material on conduct or ethics (German Physical Society, 2019c). In contrast, 
APA offers 33 continuing education programs on ethics in psychology which are accessible through 
its website (American Psychological Association, 2019b), once again, revealing its forward-thinking 
outlook and prioritisation of scientific values. APA is additionally a pioneer in its inclusion of

comprehensive enforceable content on education and training in its ethics code (American 
Psychological Association, 2019d). 
 
Berezow’s framework has been used to structure the argument that psychology is far from 
unscientific (Berezow, 2012). Presentations of various associations have been utilised to demonstrate 
that psychology is a leader in the promotion of scientific values. The argument has been supported 
by comparisons between the rigid view of Berezow’s stance, as in precise units of measurement for 
example, against psychology's view that novelty in experiments enable creativity and address human 
needs. Berezow’s strict idea of predictability, as being hard to establish in psychology, has been 
challenged by investigations into human behaviour such as tracking movement patterns after natural 
disasters (Song, et al, 2010). Reproducibility and highly controlled conditions have been discussed in 
relation to the lengths psychology research will go to, to discover truths. Thus, experiments are 
shown to meet scientific values of honesty and truthfulness (Erduran & Dagher, 2014). Various 
ethical codes have been presented and contrasted in relation to the wider scientific community 
(Stricker, 2010), demonstrating the depth of advancement and progressiveness in APA singling 
psychology out as an innovator pushing boundaries to advance values. The elements of an informal 
approach promote integrity (Resnik, 2012), and a formal approach in APA’s ethics code reinforces 
both credibility and enforceability (Fisher, 2003; Hobbs, 1948) setting an example for other scientific 
associations to follow. Psychology leads the promotion of values on a global scale, and in training and 
education. In conclusion, this essay has demonstrated that far from being unscientific, psychology is 
in fact, a leader in the promotion of scientific values.
