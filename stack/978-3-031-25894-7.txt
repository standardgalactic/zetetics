Preface
The ‘dynamic turn’ in logic and language is now almost ﬁfty years old. The mid- to late
1970s and early 1980s saw the appearance both of adaptations of logics for reasoning
about programs in computer science to the setting of modal logic and Kripke semantics,
such as Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL, Pratt, Fischer and Ladner, Segerberg, and
others), and of proposals in natural language semantics, such as the Discourse Rep-
resentation Theory (DRT) of Kamp and the File Change Semantics of Heim, to extend
‘static’ truth-conditional semantics for propositions to a dynamic semantics for dis-
course. Of course, ‘dynamic’ is a vague term. Kripke style semantics, with its rich
repertoire of relations between states (of information, of program execution, of belief,
of common ground, ...), is well suited as a framework for describing dynamic pro-
cesses. Such descriptions can still take the meaning of a sentence, classically, to be the
set of states in which it is true. Kamp and Heim style semantics changes the notion of
meaning itself, now viewed as an instruction for how to update the current set of states
when the sentence is accepted; put differently, as a context/information change
potential.
Since then, logical dynamics and dynamics in linguistic semantics have each
developed into vast and fairly well-deﬁned areas of research, largely independent of
each other although there have also been points of contact. In logic, besides describing
the behavior of programs, systems modeling the actions of agents based on their
attitudes (knowledge, belief, goals, ...) have been developed by scholars at the interface
of logic, philosophy, computer science, artiﬁcial intelligence, and social sciences. The
basic setting is still modal; Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) brings updating actions
like announcements with various degrees of persuasive power explicitly into the object
language syntax, while other approaches keep a more standard syntax but assign new
dynamic meanings.
In linguistics, Kamp and Heim style dynamic semantics was originally introduced to
deal with anaphora, quantiﬁcation, and presupposition projection. It has since been
applied to an array of linguistic phenomena, such as epistemic modals, conditionals,
plurals, tense and aspect, generalized quantiﬁers, propositional attitudes, vagueness,
and discourse relations. Other approaches to extending classical truth-conditional
meaning to a dynamic setting include situation semantics, dynamic predicate logic
(DPL), variants of game-theoretic semantics, and, more recently, inquisitive semantics
which treats statements and questions on a par.
The workshop brought together scholars from both traditions. Due to travel
restrictions caused by the corona pandemic, it was held online, on March 31 – April 4,
2022. There were 23 submitted abstracts, 15 of which were presented at the workshop,
which in addition had four invited talks and two tutorials. Two of the invited papers are
published in this volume, together with seven of the contributed papers, after a careful
review process. We express our sincere gratitude to all the colleagues who helped
reviewing the submissions.

This was the third edition of the workshop series Interdisciplinary Workshops on
Logic, Language, and Meaning held at Tsinghua University since its successful debut
in April 2019. The plan is to continue the event and keep exploring fascinating aspects
of the interface between logic and language.

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in Dynamic Semantics

Abstract. The article presents a bilateral update semantics for epis-
temic modals which captures their discourse dynamics [54] as well as
their potential to give rise to fc inferences [58]. The latter are derived
as neglect-zero eﬀects as in [3]. Neglect-zero is a tendency in human
cognition to disregard structures that verify sentences by virtue of an
empty witness set. The upshot of modelling the neglect-zero tendency
in a dynamic setting is a notion of dynamic logical consequence which
makes interesting predictions concerning possible divergences between
everyday and logico-mathematical reasoning.
Keywords: Dynamic semantics · Epistemic might · Free choice
disjunction · Bilateral negation · Post-supposition

Introduction
In Free Choice (fc) inferences, conjunctive meanings are derived from disjunctive
modal sentences contrary to the prescriptions of classical logic:
(1)
Deontic fc
[35]
a.
You may go to the beach or to the cinema.
b.
; You may go to the beach and you may go to the cinema.
(2)
Epistemic fc
[58]
a.
Mr. X might be in Victoria or in Brixton.
b.
; Mr. X might be in Victoria and he might be in Brixton.
[3] presented a formal account of fc inferences in a bilateral state-based modal
logic (BSML). The novel hypothesis at the core of the proposal was that fc
and related inferences are a straightforward consequence of a tendency in human
cognition to neglect models that verify sentences by virtue of some empty conﬁg-
urations (zero-models). Using tools from team semantics [51,57], [3] showed that
the tendency to neglect zero-models (neglect-zero tendency) derives fc infer-
ences (when interpreting disjunctions speakers associate each disjunct with a
non-empty possibility) and their cancellation under negation. The latter result
relied on the adopted bilateralism, where each connective comes with an asser-
tion and a rejection condition, and negation is deﬁned in terms of the latter
notion [31,45,49].

In this article I will present a Bilateral Update Semantics (BiUS), building
on [54]’s update semantics for epistemic might, where the neglect-zero tendency
is explicitly formalised in a dynamic setting. The resulting system will derive
ignorance and epistemic fc inferences as neglect-zero eﬀects, as in [3], as well as
capture the dynamics of epistemic modals in discourse, as in [54].
One crucial diﬀerence with respect to classical dynamic semantics [28,29,54]
concerns the treatment of negation. Like BSML, BiUS adopts a bilateral notion
of negation validating double negation elimination. When extended to the ﬁrst-
order case, BiUS has therefore the potential to provide an account of Barbara
Partee’s bathroom example (as explained at the end of Sect. 3.3, example (38)).
The dynamic notion of logical consequence deﬁned by BiUS further makes inter-
esting predictions concerning the impact of neglect-zero on everyday reasoning
and its deviation from classical logic.
The next section presents static BSML and its main motivation; Sect. 3 intro-
duces BiUS, its core results and applications; Sect. 4 discusses some potential
applications of the dynamic implementation of neglect-zero to the psychology of
everyday reasoning; and Sect. 5 concludes.

Bilateral State-Based Modal Logic (BSML)
In team semantics formulas are interpreted with respect to a set of points of
evaluation (a team) rather than single points [51,57]. In a team based modal
logic [39,52], teams are sets of possible worlds. BSML is a bilateral version of a
team-based modal logic [3,8] where teams are interpreted as information states.
Bilateralism in this context means that we model assertion and rejection con-
ditions rather than truth. In BSML, inferences relate speech acts rather than
propositions and therefore might diverge from classical semantic entailments.
– Classical modal logic: M, w |= φ, where w ∈W
– Team-based modal logic: M, t |= φ, where t ⊆W
– Bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML):
M, s |= φ, “φ is assertable in information state s”,
with s ⊆W
M, s
|=
φ, “φ is rejectable in information state s”,
with s ⊆W
2.1
Motivation
BSML was developed as part of a larger project with the goal to arrive at a formal
account of a class of natural language inferences which diverge from classical
entailments but also from canonical conversational implicatures. These include
ignorance inference in modiﬁed numerals [4,16,24,47] and epistemic indeﬁnites
[5,7,32] and phenomena of free choice in indeﬁnites and disjunction [18,35,58].

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in Dynamic Semantics

Let us focus on the case of fc inferences triggered by disjunction as in (3).
(3)
You may (A or B) ; You may A
The logical counterpart of (3) is not valid in standard deontic logic [55]:
(4)
3(α ∨β) →3α
[Free Choice (fc) principle]
Plainly making the fc principle valid, for example by adding it as an axiom,
would not do because we would be able to derive 3b from any other 3a as
shown in (5) [35].
(5)
1.
3a
[assumption]
2.
3(a ∨b)
[from 1, by classical reasoning]
3.
3b
[from 2, by fc principle]
The step leading to 2 in (5) uses the following classically valid principle:
(6)
3α →3(α ∨β)
The natural language counterpart of (6), however, seems invalid [44]:
(7)
You may post this letter ̸; You may post this letter or burn it.
Thus our intuitions in natural language are in direct opposition to the principles
of classical logic.
Many solutions have been proposed to solve the paradox of free choice
(see [41] for a recent overview). Pragmatic neo-Gricean solutions derive fc
inferences as conversational implicatures, i.e., pragmatic inferences derived
as the product of rational interactions between cooperative language users
[21,27,38,46]. On this view the step leading to 3 is unjustiﬁed. In grammatical
solutions, instead, fc inferences result from the (optional) application of covert
grammatical operators [9,10,15,20]. Again the step leading to 3 is unjustiﬁed and
the paradox is solved without the need to modify the logical system. Seman-
tic solutions by contrast typically change the logic. fc inferences are treated as
semantic entailments [2,11,25,48]. The step leading to 3 is justiﬁed, but then it
is the step leading to 2 which is no longer valid [2] or transitivity fails [25].
The main hypothesis behind the BSML solution is that fc inferences
are neither the result of conversational reasoning (as proposed in neo-gricean
approaches) nor the eﬀect of optional applications of grammatical operators (as
in the grammatical view). Rather they are a straightforward consequence of
something else speakers do in conversation. Namely, when interpreting a sen-
tence they create structures representing reality, pictures of the world [33] and
in doing so they systematically neglect structures which (vacuously) verify the
sentence by virtue of some empty conﬁguration. This tendency, which [3] calls
neglect-zero, follows from the expected diﬃculty of the cognitive operation of
evaluating truths with respect to empty witness sets [12].

M. Aloni
Models which verify a sentence by virtue of some empty set are called zero-
models. As an illustration [3] discusses the following examples:
(8)
Every square is black.
a.
Veriﬁer: [■, ■, ■]
b.
Falsiﬁer: [■, □, ■]
c.
Zero-models: [ ]; [△, △, △]; [3, ▲, ♠]
(9)
Less than three squares are black.
a.
Veriﬁer: [■, □, ■]
b.
Falsiﬁer: [■, ■, ■]
c.
Zero-models: [ ]; [△, △, △]; [3, ▲, ♠]
The interpretation of (8) and (9) leads to the creation of structures representing
reality, some verifying the sentence (the models depicted in (a)), some falsifying
it (the models in (b)). The neglect-zero hypothesis states that zero-models, the
ones represented in (c), are usually kept out of consideration. Zero-models are
neglected because they are cognitively taxing, as conﬁrmed by ﬁndings from
number cognition [12,42]. This diﬃculty can be argued to further explain the
special status of the zero among the natural numbers [42]; the existential import
eﬀects operative in the logic of Aristotle (the inference from every A is B to some
A is B); and why downward-monotonic quantiﬁers (e.g., less than n squares) are
more diﬃcult to process than upward-monotonic ones (e.g., more than n squares)
[12]. Since empty witnesses in zero-models encode the absence of objects, they
are more detached from sensory experience and therefore harder to conceive.
The inference from the perception of absence to the truth of a sentence brings in
additional costs, which results in a systematic dispreference for zero-models, a
neglect-zero tendency. The idea at the core of [3] is that fc and related inferences,
just like the Aristotelian existential import eﬀects, are a consequence of such
neglect-zero tendency assumed to be operative among language users in ordinary
conversations.
Like neo-Gricean solutions, the neglect-zero approach views fc inferences
as pragmatic inferences, albeit not of the conversational implicature kind. Like
semantic solutions, [3] modiﬁes classical logic, but not to derive fc inferences
as semantic entailments, but rather to formally describe the pragmatic factors
responsible for these inferences and isolate their impact in a rigorous way. As
we will see, BSML formally deﬁnes a pragmatic enrichment function [ ]+ and
generates fc inferences only for enriched [3(a∨b)]+. When enriched, this formula
is no longer derivable from 3a. Like in grammatical approaches, the paradox in
(5) is then solved as a case of equivocation:

[3] gives two pieces of evidence in favor of the neglect-zero solution to the paradox
of fc.
Argument from Empirical Coverage. Although pragmatic, grammatical and
semantic accounts can derive the basic fc inference (labeled as Narrow Scope
fc below), fc sentences give rise to complex inference patterns when embedded
under logical operators: fc inferences systematically disappear in negative con-
texts (Dual Prohibition), but are embeddable under universal quantiﬁers (Uni-
versal fc); furthermore they arise under double negation (Double Negation fc)
and also when disjunction takes wide scope with respect to the modal operator
(Wide scope fc):

As shown in [3] these patterns are captured by the neglect-zero approach
implemented in BSML. Most other approaches instead need additional assump-
tions as summarised in Table 1.1,2

Argument from Cognitive Plausibility. Disjunction in natural language can give
rise to diﬀerent pragmatic eﬀects:
(16)
You may have coﬀee or tea.
a.
Ignorance: ¬K3α ∧¬K3β (speaker doesn’t know which)
b.
fc inference: 3α ∧3β (you may choose which)
c.
Scalar implicature: ¬3(α ∧β) (you may not have both)
On neo-Gricean and grammatical accounts, fc inferences and scalar impli-
catures are viewed as originating from a common source: Gricean reasoning or
the application of covert grammatical operators, see Table 2. The experimental
literature however has shown remarkable diﬀerences between fc and scalar infer-
ences. The former are more robust and easier to process than the latter [14,53]
and are acquired earlier [50].
1 Among the exceptions to this claim is [25]. See [3] for a comparison.
2 Consider approaches in the grammatical tradition. Dual Prohibition cases are not
derived directly but are explained by appealing to variations of the Strongest Mean-
ing Hypothesis [17]. To account for wide scope fc inferences, which again cannot
be generated by (recursive) applications of grammatical exhaustiﬁcation, diﬀerent
strategies must be employed (see [9,10]). As for the case of double negation fc,
as discussed in detail in [26], pages 147–149, by recursive exhaustiﬁcation only we
cannot capture the so-called all-others-free-choice inference displayed in (14).
Inclusion-based grammatical accounts [9,10], given some additional assumptions
about alternatives, can derive the inference for ‘exactly one’ sentences but need
further modiﬁcations to account for similar readings in the case of sentences using
‘exactly two’ or higher. In a logic-based account like BSML, the all-others-free-
choice reading in all these variants can be captured simply by validating dual prohi-
bition (¬3(α∨β) ; ¬3α∧¬3β) and double negation fc (¬¬3(α∨β) ; 3α∧3β).
The former allows us to derive the blue part in the inference below and the latter
the red part:
(i)
∃x(¬3(α(x) ∨β(x)) ∧∀y(y ̸= x →¬¬3(α(y) ∨β(y)))) ;
∃x(¬3α(x) ∧¬3β(x) ∧∀y(y ̸= x →(3α(y) ∧3β(y))))
.

The neglect-zero hypothesis has the potential to arrive at a principled expla-
nation of these diﬀerences. On this view, fc inferences are not akin to scalar
implicatures. fc follows from the assumption that when interpreting sentences
language users neglect zero-models. Zero-models are neglected because cogni-
tively taxing. Thus fc inferences result from a tendency to avoid a cognitive
diﬃculty. Their low processing cost and early acquisition are therefore expected
on this view. However, the question of how to model scalar implicatures in BSML
remains. In particular, if the modelling leads to correct predictions in terms of
processing and acquisition. This is one of the issues left open in [3].

BSML: Formal Deﬁnitions
The target language is the language of propositional modal logic enriched with
the non-emptiness atom, ne, from team logic [57], which [3] uses to deﬁne the
pragmatic enrichment function [ ]+.
Deﬁnition 1 (Language). The language LBSML is deﬁned recursively as
φ := p | ¬φ | φ ∧φ | φ ∨φ | 3φ | ne
where p ∈PROP, a countable set of propositional variables.
A Kripke model for LBSML is a triple, M = ⟨W, R, V ⟩, where W is a set of
worlds, R is an accessibility relation on W and V is a world-dependent valuation
function for the elements of PROP.
Formulas in the language are interpreted in models M with respect to a
state s ⊆W. Both support, |=, and anti-support,
|=
, conditions are speciﬁed.
On the intended interpretation M, s |= φ stands for ‘formula φ is assertable in
s’ and M, s
|=
φ stands for ‘formula φ is rejectable in s’, where s stands for the
information state of the relevant speaker. R[w] refers to the set {v ∈W | wRv}.

Deﬁnition 2 (Semantic clauses).
M, s |= p iﬀ∀w ∈s : V (w, p) = 1

3φ iﬀ∀w ∈s : M, R[w]
|=
φ
M, s |= ne iﬀs ̸= ∅
M, s
|=
ne iﬀs = ∅
[3] adopts the standard abbreviation: 2φ := ¬3¬φ, and therefore derives the
following interpretation for the necessity modal:
M, s |= 2φ iﬀfor all w ∈s : R[w] |= φ
M, s
|=
2φ iﬀfor all w ∈s : there is a t ⊆R[w] : t ̸= ∅& t
|=
φ
Logical consequence is deﬁned as preservation of support.3
Deﬁnition 3 (Logical consequence). φ |= ψ iﬀfor all M, s : M, s |= φ ⇒
M, s |= ψ
In this framework we can further deﬁne team-sensitive restrictions on the acces-
sibility relation.
Deﬁnition 4 (Team-sensitive constraints on R)
– R is indisputable in (M, s) iﬀfor all w, v ∈s : R[w] = R[v]
– R is state-based in (M, s) iﬀfor all w ∈s : R[w] = s
An accessibility relation R is state-based in a model-state pair (M, s) if all and
only worlds in s are R-accessible within s. An accessibility relation R is indis-
putable in a model-state pair (M, s) if any two worlds in s access exactly the same
set of worlds according to R. Clearly if R is state-based, R is also indisputable.
[3] proposes to use these constraints to capture the diﬀerence between epis-
temic and deontic modal verbs. In BSML, if we adopt a state-based accessibility
relation, we can capture the infelicity of so-called epistemic contradictions [56],
while preserving the non-factivity of 3:

1. Epistemic contradiction: 3α ∧¬α |= ⊥
(if R is state-based)
2. Non-factivity: 3α ̸|= α
This motivates the assumption of a state-based R for epistemic modal verbs - the
assertion of the epistemic possibility of a proposition conjoined with its negation
as in (17) is indeed infelicitous [30,40,54,56], but not for deontic ones, which
don’t give rise to similar infelicities, see (18):
(17)
#It might be raining but it is not raining.
(18)
You may smoke, but you don’t smoke.
The accessibility relation in the case of deontic modals can at most be indis-
putable. Assuming s represents the information state of the relevant speaker, a
state-based R leads to an interpretation of the modal as a quantiﬁer over the
epistemic possibilities the speaker entertains. An indisputable R instead only
means that the speaker is fully informed about R, so, if R represents a deontic
accessibility relation, indisputability means that the speaker is fully informed
about (or has full authority on) what propositions are obligatory or allowed, as
for example is arguably the case in performative uses.

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in BSML
In BSML, a state s supports a disjunction iﬀs is the union of two substates, each
supporting one of the disjuncts. As an illustration consider the states represented
in Fig. 1. In these pictures wa stands for a world where only a is true, wb only
b, etc. The disjunction (a ∨b) is supported by the ﬁrst two states, but not by
Fig. 3(c) because the latter consists of w∅, a world where both a and b are false.
The state in Fig. 1(b) supports (a ∨b), because we can ﬁnd suitable substates
supporting each disjunct: the state itself, supporting a, and the empty state,
vacuously supporting b. State Fig. 1(b) is then an example of a zero-model for
(a ∨b), a model which veriﬁes the formula by virtue of an empty witness. Using
ne, [3] deﬁnes a notion of pragmatic enrichment, whose core eﬀect is to disallow
such zero-models. A state s supports a pragmatically enriched disjunction [α ∨
β]+ iﬀs is the union of two non-empty substates, each supporting one of the
disjuncts. Such enriched disjunctions thus require both their disjuncts to be live

possibilities [23,58]. The pragmatic enrichment function is recursively deﬁned
for formulas in the ne-free fragment of the language as follows:
Deﬁnition 5 (Pragmatic enrichment function)
[p]+ = p ∧ne
[¬α]+ = ¬[α]+ ∧ne
[α ∨β]+ = ([α]+ ∨[β]+) ∧ne
[α ∧β]+ = ([α]+ ∧[β]+) ∧ne
[3α]+ = 3[α]+ ∧ne
The main result of this research is that in BSML [ ]+-enrichments have non-trivial
eﬀects only when applied to positive disjunctions. This, in combination with the
adopted notion of modality, derives fc inferences for pragmatically enriched for-
mulas while no undesirable side eﬀects obtain with other conﬁgurations, notably
under single negation:
– Narrow scope fc: [3(α ∨β)]+ |= 3α ∧3β
– Dual Prohibition: [¬3(α ∨β)]+ |= ¬3α ∧¬3β
– Double Negation: [¬¬3(α ∨β)]+ |= 3α ∧3β
– Wide scope fc: [3α ∨3β]+ |= 3α ∧3β
[if R is indisputable]
Notice that an indisputable R is required for deriving wide scope fc infer-
ences. This means that wide scope fc is always predicted for epistemic modals,
which, leading to epistemic contradiction, require an accessibility relation which
is state-based and therefore indisputable (see Deﬁnition 4). Deontic modals
instead only lead to wide scope fc inference in certain contexts, namely when the
assumption of indisputability is justiﬁed.4 These are contexts where the speaker
is assumed to be fully informed about what is obligatory or allowed, for example
in some performative uses of the verb. A further prediction of BSML is that cases
of overt fc cancellations like (19)–(20) have to be treated as cases of wide scope
fc where the assumption of indisputability is not warranted. In both cases, the
prediction is arguably borne out [22,36].

Finally notice that in this framework neglect-zero eﬀects can be isolated and
literal meanings, ruled by classical logic, can be recovered. We can indeed model
the global suspension of neglect-zero eﬀects using BSML∅, the ne-free fragment
of BSML, which behaves like classical modal logic (CML).
α |=BSML β iﬀα |=CML β
[if α, β are ne-free]
In BSML∅, which captures logico-mathematical reasoning, zero-models are
always allowed and play an essential role. Paraphrasing Whitehead, we can con-
jecture that the use of zero-models ‘is only forced on us by the needs of cultivated
modes of thought’.5
‘The point about zero is that we do not need to use it in the operations
of daily life. No one goes out to buy zero ﬁsh. It is in a way the most
civilized of all the cardinals, and its use is only forced on us by the needs
of cultivated modes of thought.’ (A.N. Whitehead quoted by [42]).
We will return to the role of zero-models in everyday and logico-mathematical
reasoning in Sect. 4.

An Update Semantics for Epistemic fc
In this section we introduce, BiUS, a bilateral update semantics for epistemic
fc. Our point of departure is Veltman’s update semantics for epistemic might
[19,54]. One of the goals of [54] was to account for dynamic eﬀects of epistemic
modals in discourse. Veltman observed a diﬀerence between sequences like (21-a)
and (21-b): ‘it is quite normal for one’s expectations to be overruled by the facts
- that is what is going on in the ﬁrst sequence. But once you know something,
it is a bit silly to pretend that you still expect something else, which is what is
going on in the second’ (see [54], page 223).
(21)
Veltman’s sequences

Maybe this is Frank Veltman’s example. It isn’t his example!
b. ?This is not Frank Veltman’s example! Maybe it’s his example.
As we saw in the previous section, BSML can capture the infelicity of
epistemic contradictions (example (17)) by modelling epistemic modals via a
state-based accessibility relation. But the distinction illustrated in (21) could
not be explained. BiUS will remedy to this deﬁciency: it will capture the dis-
course dynamics of epistemic modals but also their fc potential, which was not
addressed in [54]:
5 This conjecture needs to be qualiﬁed. We do engage with zero-models in our daily
life, for example when interpreting sentences with downward entailing quantiﬁers
which can only be veriﬁed by zero-models, e.g., I have zero ideas of how to prove this
or I went to the store to buy ﬁsh, but they didn’t have any, so we’ll have no ﬁsh for
dinner tonight. Downward entailing quantiﬁers (no/zero) however are more costly to
process than their upward entailing counterparts (some), a fact which can be taken
to conﬁrm the cognitive diﬃculty of engaging with zero-models.

The fc inferences in (22)–(23) will be derived as neglect-zero eﬀects as in BSML.
The upshot of modelling neglect-zero in a dynamic setting is a notion of dynamic
consequence which will make interesting predictions concerning possible diver-
gences between everyday and logico-mathematical reasoning, as will be discussed
in Sect. 4.
3.1
Veltman’s Update Semantics for Epistemic Modals
Veltman presented an Update Semantics (US) for a propositional language with
an additional unary operator (here 3) expressing epistemic might [19,54]. The
language is deﬁned as follows precluding Boolean operations on the might-
formulas.
Deﬁnition 6 (Syntax). The languages LP L and LUS are deﬁned recursively
as:
LP L : α := p | ¬α | α ∨α | α ∧α
LUS : φ := α | 3α
where p ∈PROP, a countable set of propositional variables.
Models are pairs M = ⟨W, V ⟩, where W is a set of possible worlds and V is
a world-dependent valuation function. Information states, s ⊆W, are sets of
possible worlds. Formulas in LUS denote functions from states to states.
Deﬁnition 7 (Updates).
s[p] = s ∩{w ∈W | V (p, w) = 1}
s[φ ∧ψ] = s[φ] ∩s[ψ]
s[φ ∨ψ] = s[φ] ∪s[ψ]
s[¬φ] = s −s[φ]
s[3φ] = s, if s[φ] ̸= ∅;
= ∅, otherwise
Support and logical consequence are deﬁned in terms of the update function,
as standard in dynamic semantics. A state s supports a formula φ, s |= φ, if
updating s with the formula does not lead to any change.

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in Dynamic Semantics
13
Deﬁnition 8 (Support)
s |= φ iﬀs[φ] = s
A formula is a consequence of a sequence of premisses, φ1, . . . , φn |= ψ iﬀany
state resulting from an update with the premisses, supports the conclusion.6
Deﬁnition 9 (Logical consequence)
φ1, . . . , φn |= ψ iﬀfor all s : s[φ1] . . . [φn] |= ψ
In Fig. 2 we give some illustrations for PROP = {a, b}. As in BSML, also in
US the information state depicted in Fig. 2(b) is predicted to be a zero-model for
(a ∨b). It supports the formula by virtue of an empty witness set. Our goal here
is to extend US with a notion of neglect-zero enrichments whose core eﬀect is
again to rule out such zero-models. As we saw in the previous section [3] deﬁned
pragmatic enrichment in terms of a conjunction with ne. This strategy however
will not work in the context of an update semantics. A natural interpretation for
an update with ne would be s[ne] = s, if s ̸= ∅; ∅(or undeﬁned) otherwise. But
the conjunction φ∧ne, given Veltman’s semantics for ∧, would only rule out the
empty state as a possible input for the formula. To model dynamic pragmatic
enrichments we will instead introduce a complex expression φne, where ne is
interpreted as a post-supposition, i.e., a constraint that needs to be satisﬁed
after the update with the relevant sentence:
wab
wa
wb
w∅
(a) ̸|= a; |= a ∨b
wab
wa
wb
w∅
(b) |= a; |= a ∨b
wab
wa
wb
w∅
(c) |= ¬a; |= ¬(a ∨
b)
Fig. 2. Illustrations of support in Veltman’s update semantics
(24)
s[φne] = s[φ], if s[φ] ̸= ∅; undeﬁned (#) otherwise
Compare the notion of a post-supposed ne with the more familiar notion
of a presupposition φ[ψ] which must be satisﬁed before the update (in the
local context), and with Veltman’s might, 3φ, which expresses the same non-
emptiness requirement as φne but diﬀers in the produced output state: s (rather
than s[φ]) if the requirement is satisﬁed; ∅(rather than #) otherwise:
6 It is worth mentioning that this is only one of the notions of logical consequence
discussed in [54]. In fact, [54] eventually adopts a version which does not quantify
over states.

14
M. Aloni
– Post-supposed ne: s[φne] = s[φ], if s[φ] ̸= ∅; undeﬁned (#) otherwise
– Presupposition: s[φ[ψ]] = s[φ], if s |= ψ; undeﬁned (#) otherwise
– Veltman’s might: s[3φ] = s, if s[φ] ̸= ∅; ∅otherwise
It is easy to see that modal disjunction (ignorance) and epistemic fc infer-
ences are straightforwardly derived for enriched disjunctions deﬁned in terms of
post-supposed ne:
(25)
αne ∨βne |= 3α ∧3β
(26)
3(αne ∨βne) |= 3α ∧3β
But what about negation? Under negation (enriched) disjunction should
behave classically:
(27)
Mr X is not in A or B ; Mr X is not in A and he is not in B.
(28)
Mr X cannot be in A or B ; Mr X cannot be in A and he cannot be in
B.
Standard dynamic negation (s[¬φ] = s −s[φ]) gives wrong results here. The
formula in (29) would never be supported by any state. For example, it would
be undeﬁned in {w∅}, a state which would support ¬(a ∨b):
(29)
¬(ane ∨bne)
To ﬁx this problem the update semantics we will introduce below adopts a
bilateral notion of negation, as in BSML, deﬁned in terms of a rejection update
function [ ]r as in (30):
(30)
s[¬φ] = s[φ]r & s[¬φ]r = s[φ]
Let us have a closer look.
3.2
Bilateral Update Semantics (BiUS)
We work with the language of propositional modal logic extended with φne,
expressing a post-supposed requirement of non-emptiness.7
Deﬁnition 10 (Syntax). The language LBiUS is recursively deﬁned as:
φ := p | ¬φ | (φ ∨φ) | (φ ∧φ) | 3φ | φne
with p ∈PROP, a countable set of propositional variables.
7 The language of BiUS allows Boolean operations on 3-formulas in contrast to Velt-
man’s LUS, which precluded iteration and embedding of the 3-operator. Because of
this restriction, US validated idempotence (s[φ] = s[φ][φ]) and monotonicity (s ⊆t
implies s[φ] ⊆t[φ]), which instead are not generally valid in BiUS. The adoption of
a more liberal language is motivated by our linguistic goals. For example we want to
explain wide scope free choice and the interpretation of might under negation. Some
of our results however will depend on idempotence and monotonicity and, therefore,
will only be valid for a fragment of the language.

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in Dynamic Semantics
15
Models, M = ⟨W, V ⟩, and states, s ⊆W, are deﬁned as above. Formulas again
denote functions from states to states. In Deﬁnition 11, only the clauses for post-
supposed ne (clause 5) and negation (clause 6) are new. As explained above, an
update with φne returns the input state s updated with φ, if s[φ] is deﬁned and
diﬀerent from ∅; undeﬁned otherwise. Negation is deﬁned in terms of a recursively
deﬁned rejection update function [ ]r. Notice that in the rejection update for φne
the contribution of ne is trivialized (clause 5′).
Deﬁnition 11 (Updates).
1. s[p] = s ∩{w ∈W | V (p, w) = 1}
2. s[φ ∧ψ] = s[φ] ∩s[ψ]
3. s[φ ∨ψ] = s[φ] ∪s[ψ]
4. s[3φ] = s, if s[φ] ̸= ∅; ∅, if s[φ] = ∅; undeﬁned (#) otherwise
5. s[φne] = s[φ], if s[φ] ̸= ∅; undeﬁned (#) otherwise
6. s[¬φ] = s[φ]r
where [φ]r is recursively deﬁned as follows:
1′ s[p]r = s ∩{w ∈W | V (p, w) = 0}
2′ s[φ ∧ψ]r = s[φ]r ∪s[ψ]r
3′ s[φ ∨ψ]r = s[φ]r ∩s[ψ]r
4′ s[3φ]r = s, if s[φ]r = s; ∅, if s[φ]r ̸= s; undeﬁned (#) otherwise
5′ s[φne]r = s[φ]r
6′ s[¬φ]r = s[φ]
and s ̸= x means s is a state diﬀerent from x (i.e., it excludes #) and x ∪y and
x ∩y are deﬁned only if both x and y are deﬁned.
Support is deﬁned as above.
Deﬁnition 12 (Support).
s |= φ iﬀs[φ] = s
A formula is a consequence of a sequence of premisses, φ1, . . . , φn |= ψ iﬀ
any state resulting from an update with the premisses, if deﬁned, supports the
conclusion.
Deﬁnition 13 (Logical consequence).
φ1, . . . , φn |= ψ iﬀfor all s : s[φ1] . . . [φn] deﬁned ⇒s[φ1] . . . [φn] |= ψ
At last we deﬁne neglect-zero enrichments in terms of φne. Pragmatically
enriching an ne-free formula α, |α|+, consists in adding the post-supposition of
ne to any subformula of α.

16
M. Aloni
Deﬁnition 14 (Dynamic pragmatic enrichment). For ne-free α, |α|+
deﬁned as follows:
|p|+ = pne
|¬α|+ = (¬|α|+)ne
|α ∨β|+ = (|α|+ ∨|β|+)ne
|α ∧β|+ = (|α|+ ∧|β|+)ne
|3α|+ = (3|α|+)ne
For example, |p ∨¬q|+ = (pne ∨(¬qne)ne)ne.
3.3
Results
It is easy to see that BiUS matches the predictions of [3] with respect to epistemic
fc, while at the same time captures the discourse dynamic of epistemic might
as in [54].
As in [3], we derive ignorance and fc inferences for pragmatically enriched
formulas, while no undesirable side eﬀects obtain under negation:8,9

9 Notice that Modal disjunction and Negation 1 only hold for α and β of the restricted
language LUS. Counterexamples in the unrestricted LBiUS involve formulas which
violate idempotence, such as epistemic contradictions. E.g., |(p ∧3¬p) ∨p|+ ̸|=
3(p ∧3¬p) (counterexample to Modal Disjunction), and |¬(¬(p ∧3¬p) ∨¬p)|+ ̸|=
¬¬(p ∧3¬p) (counterexample to Negation 1).

We also match the predictions of [54] with respect to Veltman’s sequences,
deriving a diﬀerence between sequences 3α; ¬α and ¬α; 3α with the latter lead-
ing to contradiction and the former, instead, being consistent (update does not
necessarily lead to the state of absurdity), although incoherent (no non-empty
supporting state), exactly as in [54]:

3α, ¬α ̸|= ⊥
b. ?This is not Frank Veltman’s example! Maybe it’s his example.

Note instead that the ordering of the conjuncts does not matter in the follow-
ing versions of epistemic contradictions, which were not expressible in Veltman’s
original system and which are here both predicted to be incoherent:
(37)

a. ?It might be raining but it isn’t raining.
3α ∧¬α ̸|= ⊥, but incoherent
b. ?It isn’t raining but it might be raining.

In fact the φne-free fragment of BiUS is equivalent to US if we preclude
iterations and embedding of the might-operator.
α1, . . . , αn |=BiUS β iﬀα1, . . . , αn |=US β
[if α1, ..., αn, β ∈LUS]
And the non-modal and φne-free fragment of BiUS is equivalent to classical
logic:
α1, . . . , αn |=BiUS β iﬀα1, . . . , αn |=CL β
[if α1, . . . , αn, β ∈LP L]

18
M. Aloni
The latter fact means that in BiUS we can isolate neglect-zero eﬀects just
like in BSML.
In contrast to other standard dynamic systems, however, BiUS validates dou-
ble negation elimination (also for non-eliminative φ):
– Double Negation Elimination: ¬¬φ ≡φ10
Thus BiUS also validates double negation fc (see example (14) and footnote
2 for motivation):
– Double Negation fc: |¬¬3(α ∨β)|+ |= 3α ∧3β
Moreover, when applied to dynamic systems for anaphora (e.g., [29]) bilateral
negation can give us a treatment of Partee’s bathroom example [37]:
(38)
a.
Either there is no bathroom in this house or it’s in a funny place.
b.
¬∃xPx ∨Qx
In [29], example (38) is problematic because the last occurrence of x in (38-b) is
not bound by ∃x, since dynamic negation neutralises the dynamic potential of
existential quantiﬁers in its scope.
Let us assume an account of the existential quantiﬁer, conjunction and dis-
junction as in [29] in combination with a bilateral notion of negation as in BiUS:
– s[∃xφ] = 
d∈D(s[x/d][φ])
– s[φ ∧ψ] = s[φ][ψ]
– s[φ ∨ψ] = {i ∈s | i survives in (s[φ] ∪s[¬φ][ψ])}
– s[¬φ] = s[φ]r
Then no matter what rejection clause one assumes for ∃x, the last occurrence of
x in (38-b) would be bound by ∃x, as illustrated by the coloured parts in (39):
(39)
s[¬∃xPx]∪s[¬¬∃xPx][Qx] = s[¬∃xPx]∪s[¬∃xPx]r[Qx] = s[¬∃xPx]∪
s[∃xPx][Qx]
The full development of a quantiﬁed version of BiUS which can capture
besides fc and related inferences also cross-sentential and donkey anaphora and
their interactions with modality [1,29] must be left to future work.

Everyday vs Logico-Mathematical Reasoning
People often reason contrary to the prescriptions of classical logic. One hypoth-
esis arising from this research is that at least in part the divergence between
everyday and logico-mathematical reasoning might be due to a neglect-zero ten-
dency. While zero-models tend to be neglected in conversation, they play a crucial
role in logico-mathematical reasoning.
According to our hypothesis there are three kinds of reasonings [let α1, ...αn, β
range over ne-free formulas]:
10 Proof: s[¬¬φ] = s[¬φ]r = s[φ].

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in Dynamic Semantics
19
1. Zero-free reasonings: classically valid reasonings which do not involve zero-
models:
α1, ..., αn |= β & |α1|+, ..., |αn|+ |= |β|+
2. Neglect-zero fallacies: classically invalid reasonings which are valid if we
neglect zero-models, e.g., ignorance and fc inferences:
α1, ..., αn ̸|= β & |α1|+, ..., |αn|+ |= |β|+
3. Zero-reasonings: classically valid reasonings which rely on zero-models:
α1, ..., αn |= β & |α1|+, ..., |αn|+ ̸|= |β|+
The hypothesis that zero-models are cognitively taxing leads to various predic-
tions. For example, zero-reasonings should be harder for non-logically trained
reasoners than zero-free reasonings. In what follows we discuss two examples
illustrating these predictions.
Consider ﬁrst Disjunction Introduction:
(40)
A. Therefore, A or B.
A rule-based theory which assumes that human reasoners apply the rules of
Natural Deduction would predict that if asked to formulate conclusions from
premise A reasoners should mention A or B. Past experiments however showed
that people who are not trained in logic do not spontaneously produce the dis-
junction [34]. Classical model-based theories of reasoning which link the diﬃculty
of a reasoning solely to the amount of models involved in the reasoning process
also fail to account for this fact [34,43]. In these theories, the premise leads to
the construction of a model validating A. But, classically, any veriﬁer of A is
also a veriﬁer of A or B and so by employing a single model the conclusion
A or B should in principle be available to the everyday reasoner. Our neglect-
zero hypothesis, instead, has a ready explanation of why this is not the case. A
minimal veriﬁer of A is also a veriﬁer for A or B but only if we allow the possi-
bility of an empty witness for the second disjunct. Since a zero-model is involved
we correctly predict that the inference is not spontaneously drawn. Disjunction
introduction is indeed an example of a zero-reasoning, classically valid but relying
on zero-models:
– α |= α ∨β, but |α|+ ̸|= |α ∨β|+
Consider now the following two versions of Disjunctive Syllogism in which
the ordering of the premises is reversed:
(41)
A or B; Not A. Therefore, B.
(42)
Not A; A or B. Therefore, B.
Both reasonings are classically valid:

20
M. Aloni
– α ∨β, ¬α |= β
– ¬α, α ∨β |= β
But only (42) involves a zero-model. Any state resulting from an update with
¬α, is a zero-model for the disjunction α ∨β. This means that the sequence
of updates s[|¬α|+][|α ∨β|+] is never deﬁned, no matter what s is, leading to
explosion:
– |¬α|+, |α ∨β|+ |= ⊥
If we reverse the ordering of the premises, with the disjunction ﬁrst as in (41), the
update is instead unproblematic and the output state supports the conclusion:
– |α ∨β|+, |¬α|+ |= |β|+ (and ̸|= ⊥)
(42) is then predicted to be harder than (41). We leave to future work the
experimental testing of this prediction. Let me stress that this last prediction
relies on the dynamic notion of logical consequence deﬁned in Deﬁnition 13 and,
therefore, if experimentally conﬁrmed, would constitute independent motivation
for the implementation of neglect-zero eﬀects in a dynamic setting.

Conclusion
We presented an update semantics for epistemic modals capturing both their
discourse dynamics and their potential to give rise to fc inferences. The latter
were derived as neglect-zero eﬀects as in [3]. In future work we intend to extend
the system to the ﬁrst order case and to further study and experimentally test
its predictions on the impact of neglect-zero on reasoning and interpretation.

Appendix
BiUS, US and PL
Theorem 1. α1, . . . , αn |=BiUS β iﬀα1, . . . , αn |=US β [if α1, ..., αn, β ∈LUS]
Proof. We only need to check the case of negation, i.e. show that s[γ]r = s−s[γ]
for all s and γ ∈LP L (recall that 3 cannot appear in the scope of negation in
LUS). We prove this by induction on the complexity of γ.
(i) s[p]r = s ∩{w ∈W | V (p, w) = 0} = s −{w ∈W | V (p, w) = 1} =
s −W[p] = s −s[p]
(ii) s[α ∧β]r = s[α]r ∪s[β]r =IH (s −s[α) ∪(s −s[β]) = s −(s[α] ∩s[β]) =
s −s[α ∧β]

Neglect-Zero Eﬀects in Dynamic Semantics
21
(iii) s[α∨β]r = s[α]r∩s[β]r =IH (s−s[α])∩(s−s[β]) = s−(s[α∪s[β) = s−s[α∨β]
(iv) s[¬α]r = s[α]. Since s[α] ⊆s by eliminativity, s[α] = s −(s −s[α]) =IH
s −s[α]r = s −s[¬α].
Theorem 2. α1, . . . , αn |=BiUS β iﬀα1, . . . , αn |=P L β [if α1, . . . , αn, β ∈
LP L]
Proof. This follows from the fact that in BiUS (just like in US, see [54], page
231), all α ∈LP L are such that for any s, s[α] = s ∩W[α].
Ignorance and Free Choice
The proofs of the facts below use the following lemmas.
Lemma 1. For α ∈LBiUS and ne-free, and any state s.
(i) If s[|α|+] is deﬁned, then s[|α|+] = s[α]
(ii) If s[|α|+]r is deﬁned, then s[|α|+]r = s[α]r
Proof. By an easy double induction on the complexity of α.
Lemma 2. For α ∈LUS and any state s.
(i) Idempotence: s[α] = s[α][α] and s[¬α] = s[¬α][¬α]
(ii) Monotonicity: s ⊆t implies s[α] ⊆t[α]
(iii) Downward closure of ¬α: s ⊆t implies t[¬α] = t ⇒s[¬α] = s.
Proof. These properties are consequences of the following two facts: (a) in LUS
all might-formulas have the form 3α, where α is 3-free; (b) all 3-free α (i.e.,
α ∈LP L) are such that for all s, s[α] = s ∩W[α].
Lemma 3 (Eliminativity). For φ ∈LBiUS and any state s.
If s[φ](r) is deﬁned, then s[φ](r) ⊆s
Fact 1 (Modal Disjunction). |α ∨β|+ |= 3α ∧3β
(if α, β ∈LUS)
Proof. Suppose s[|α∨β|+] is deﬁned. Then s[|α∨β|+] = s[|α|+]∪s[|β|+] with both
s[|α|+] and s[|β|+] deﬁned and ̸= ∅. By Lemma 1 we have s[|α|+] = s[α] ̸= ∅.
From s[|α|+] ⊆s[|α ∨β|+] it follows s[α] ⊆s[|α ∨β|+]. By monotonicity of α
(Lemma 2) we conclude s[α][α] ⊆s[|α ∨β|+][α]. Since s[α][α] = s[α] ̸= ∅(by
idempotence of α), we conclude s[|α ∨β|+][α] ̸= ∅. But then s[|α ∨β|+] |= 3α.
Similarly for 3β.
For a counterexample to Modal Disjunction with α ̸∈LUS, let α be (p ∧3¬p).
Then {wp, w∅}[|(p ∧3¬p) ∨p|+] = {wp} is deﬁned but does not support 3(p ∧
3¬p). Thus |(p ∧3¬p) ∨p|+ ̸|= 3(p ∧3¬p).
Fact 2 (Narrow Scope fc). |3(α ∨β)|+ |= 3α ∧3β

22
M. Aloni
Proof. Suppose s[|3(α∨β)|+] is deﬁned. Then s[|3(α∨β)|+] = s[3|(α∨β)|+] =
s ̸= ∅and s[|α∨β|+] = s[|α|+]∪s[|β|+] ̸= ∅. It follows that s[|α|+] ̸= ∅̸= s[|β|+].
By Lemma 1 we conclude s[α] ̸= ∅. Hence s[|3(α ∨β)|+][3α] = s and thus
s[|3(α ∨β)|+] |= 3α. Similarly for 3β.
Fact 3 (Wide Scope fc). |3α ∨3β|+ |= 3α ∧3β
Proof. Suppose s[|3α ∨3β|+] is deﬁned. Then s[|3α ∨3β|+] = s[|3α|+ ∨
|3β|+] = s[|3α|+] ∪s[|3β|+] = s ̸= ∅. Hence both s[|3α|+] and s[|3β|+] are
deﬁned which means s[3|α|+] = s[3|β|+] = s ̸= ∅. It follows that s[|α|+] ̸= ∅̸=
s[|β|+]. By Lemma 1 we conclude s[α] ̸= ∅. Hence s[|3α ∨3β|+][3α] = s and
thus s[|3α ∨3β|+] |= 3α. Similarly for 3β.
Fact 4 (Negation 1). |¬(α ∨β)|+ |= ¬α ∧¬β
(if α, β ∈LUS)
Proof. Suppose s[|¬(α∨β)|+] is deﬁned. Then s[|¬(α∨β)|+] = s[|α|+ ∨|β|+]r =
s[|α|+]r ∩s[|β|+]r. By Lemma 1 we have s[|α|+]r = s[α]r = s[¬α] ̸= ∅. From
s[|¬(α ∨β)|+] ⊆s[|α|+]r we have then s[|¬(α ∨β)|+] ⊆s[¬α]. By idempotence,
s[¬α] = s[¬α][¬α], and by downword closure, s[|¬(α∨β)|+] = s[|¬(α∨β)|+][¬α].
Hence s[|¬(α ∨β)|+] |= ¬α. Similarly for ¬β.
Fact 5 (Negation 2). |¬3(α ∨β)|+ |= ¬3α ∧¬3β
Proof. Suppose s[|¬3(α ∨β)|+] is deﬁned. Then s[|¬3(α ∨β)|+] = s[3|(α ∨
β)|+]r ̸= ∅. This means that s[3|(α ∨β)|+]r = s and so also s[|(α ∨β)|+]r =
s[|α|+ ∨|β|+]r = s[|α|+]r ∩s[|β|+]r = s. By Lemma 1, s[|α|+]r = s[α]r and so
s ⊆s[α]r. By eliminativity, s[α]r = s and so s[3α]r = s and s[¬3α] = s. Hence
s[|¬3(α ∨β)|+] |= ¬3α. Similarly for ¬3β.

Abstract. This paper re-examines two types of donkey conditional sentences
in Mandarin Chinese, ﬁrst identiﬁed by Cheng and Huang (1996), who argue
that there is a strict correspondence between types of conditional sentences and
interpretational strategies for the anaphoric elements, i.e., bare conditionals use
the unselective binding mechanism of classic DRT, while ruguo/dou-conditionals
need the E-type strategy. This claim has been challenged by Pan and Jiang (2015),
who provide ample evidence against Cheng and Huang’s paradigm. In their recent
reply, Cheng and Huang (2020) attempt to further explain the counter-examples
given by Pan and Jiang (2015), and maintain that their original proposal can be
defended. We will examine Cheng and Huang’s (2020) responses in detail, and
argue that their defense does not stand up to scrutiny. We conclude that there is
no correspondence between conditional types and interpretative mechanisms in
Chinese donkey sentences. We also provide additional data concerning sentences
with pairs of identical NPs, and point out that bare conditionals are one special
example of a general strategy of expressing co-variation in Mandarin.

Introduction
In their pioneering study on donkey anaphora in Chinese, Cheng and Huang (1996,
C&H hereafter) distinguish two types of donkey conditional sentences, namely, the so-
called ‘bare conditionals’ and ruguo/dou-conditonals: bare conditionals do not have any
overt marker to connect the antecedent clause and the consequent clause, as shown in
(1a), while ruguo-conditionals are marked by the conditional morpheme rugou ‘if’ in
the antecedent clause, as in (2a) and dou-conditionals are signaled by the quantiﬁer-like
element dou ‘all’ in the consequent clause, exempliﬁed by (3a). According to C&H, both
typesofdonkeyconditionalshaveawh-phraseintheantecedentclause,thoughtheydiffer
in what anaphoric elements are allowed in their consequent clause. Speciﬁcally, bare
conditionals require another identical wh-phrase and disallow an anaphoric (overt or null)
pronoun or a deﬁnite description, as illustrated in (1b), whereas ruguo/dou-conditionals
exhibit a complementary distribution of anaphoric elements, only permitting a (overt or
null) pronoun or a deﬁnite description and prohibiting a wh-phrase in the consequent, as
shown in (2b) and (3b). C&H further claim that the two types of conditional sentences

are associated with two different interpretation strategies, i.e., the unselective binding
mechanism of classic Discourse Representation Theory (cf. Kamp 1981, Heim 1982)
for bare conditionals and the E-type strategy (cf. Cooper 1979, Evans 1980, Heim 1990)
for ruguo/dou-conditionals.

The empirical basis and theoretical analysis of C&H (1996) have been challenged,
notably by Pan and Jiang (1997, 2015, P&J hereafter), who point out that the identi-
ﬁed complementary distribution is only apparent and object to the claim that a strict
correspondence exists between the types of donkey conditionals and the interpretation
strategies for the anaphoric elements. They argue that what C&H have observed and
proposed are only the preferred/default distributional patterns, and given appropriate
contexts, one can deviate from the preferred patterns. In particular, a pronoun can be
used in the consequent of bare conditionals and a wh-phrase can occur in the consequent
of ruguo/dou-conditionals as well; a wh-phrase can employ the E-type strategy and a
pronoun can also be interpreted as a bound variable. A Bound Variable Hierarchy is
proposed by P&J to account for the interpretative ﬂexibility of pronouns and wh-phrases
in Chinese.
Recently, C&H (2020) responded to the challenges brought up by P&J and addressed
some of the issues raised. They concluded that their original proposal can still be main-
tained. In this paper, we ﬁrst review the major empirical data that are in dispute from
previous works and establish the correct distributional patterns of anaphoric elements in

Chinese donkey sentences. We then discuss C&H’s original proposal and their recent fur-
ther elaboration. A close look at C&H (2020) reveals that their responses to P&J’s objec-
tions are still problematic, and that P&J’s null hypothesis, i.e., there is no correspondence
between sentence types and interpretation strategies, can be defended.1
2
The Empirical Picture
According to C&H (1996), the distributions of anaphoric elements in Chinese donkey
sentences demonstrated by (1)-(3) can be summarized as in (4)-(6). Crucially, pronouns
(and deﬁnite descriptions) have a complementary distribution with wh-phrases in the
consequent clause of bare conditionals and ruguo/dou-conditionals.
(4)
Bare conditionals
[antecedent…wh…], [consequent…wh/*pronoun…]
(5)
Ruguo-conditionals
[antecedent ruguo…wh…], [consequent…pronoun/*wh…]
(6)
Dou-conditionals
[antecedent …wh…], [consequent…dou…pronoun/*wh…]
Based on the above distributional patterns, C&H suggest that both the unselective
binding mechanism and the E-type strategy are necessary for the analysis of Chinese
donkey sentences. As noted earlier, they argue that there exists a correspondence between
the types of conditionals and the interpretation strategies: bare conditionals are inter-
preted by unselective binding, and ruguo/dou-conditionals employ the E-type strategy.
To illustrate, the pair of identical wh-phrases in a bare conditional such as (7a) are
analyzed as indeﬁnites, which semantically function as individual variables, following
Heim (1982), unselectively bound by a default null necessity operator, which provides
the universal quantiﬁcational force, as shown in (7b). On the other hand, in both dou-
conditionals and ruguo-conditionals, the wh-phrase in the antecedent clause is treated as
an existential quantiﬁer, and the pronoun in the consequent clause as an E-type pronoun,
which stands for a deﬁnite description recoverable from the antecedent clause (cf. (8b)
and (9b)). Furthermore, the antecedent clause containing a wh-phrase (qua an existential
quantiﬁer) in dou-conditionals is regarded as a wh-question, and dou ‘all’ quantiﬁes over
the set of propositions denoted by this question, as represented in (9b).
1 Other approaches to Chinese donkey sentences, which target speciﬁcally bare conditionals,
include the question-based approach (e.g., Liu 2018, Xiang 2020, Li 2021) and the relative-
clause-based approach (e.g., Wen 1997, 1998, Huang 2010, Luo and Crain 2011, Chen 2019).
The former takes the wh-phrase-containing clause in a bare conditional as a genuine wh-
question, while the latter analyzes it as a relative clause. Due to space limit, we focus only
on the debate between C&H and P&J here, and discuss the problems of other alternative
approaches in another paper.

P&J agree with C&H in the sense that two interpretation strategies are needed for
Chinese conditionals. What they reject is the strict correspondence between conditional
types and interpretation mechanisms and the complementary distribution of wh-phrases
and pronouns in the consequent clauses of the two types of conditionals, since abundant
exceptions to the patterns exhibited in (4)-(6) can be found. For P&J, the correlation
proposed by C&H is only the default way of interpretating anaphoric relations in Chinese
conditionals, because wh-phrases are more suitable to be used as variables, and pronouns
are by default used as E-type pronouns in Chinese.2 In addition, P&J point out that
Chinese bare conditionals prefer unselective binding while dou/ruguo-conditionals tend
to employ the E-type strategy. Since what C&H propose is just the default pattern,
deviations from it are possible, though additional contextual support is needed. That is,
under appropriate contexts, a pronoun can occur in the consequent of a bare conditional,
and a wh-phrase can also appear in the consequent clause of a ruguo/dou-conditional. It
is also possible for the wh-phrase in consequent of a bare conditional to have an E-type
interpretation, and for the pronoun in the consequent clause of a ruguo/dou-conditional
to be a bound variable. We take this to be the null hypothesis, namely that both types of
conditionals can employ either of the two interpretation strategies and with appropriate
contexts both wh-phrases and pronouns can be interpreted either as bound variables or
as E-type pronouns.
2 We regard E-type pronouns as pronouns that semantically stand for deﬁnite descriptions whose
descriptive content can be recovered from linguistic or non-linguistic contexts, without taking
a stand on the long-debated issue of whether deﬁnite NPs (and E-type pronouns) are referential
or quantiﬁcational.

Wh/pronoun Alternations in Bare Conditionals
C&H claim that in bare conditionals, the anaphoric wh-phrase in the consequent clause
cannot be replaced by a pronoun (cf. 1b). However, P&J demonstrate that this is not
case, as examples like (10) show that wh-phrases can alternate with pronouns in the
consequent clause.

Lin (1996) also observes that the anaphoric element in a bare conditional does not
have to a wh-phrase, as his examples in (11) exemplify. He further argues that a bare
conditional with an anaphoric pronoun differs from the one with a wh-phrase in that the
former only has a one-case interpretation in the sense of Kadmon (1987, 1990), whereas
the latter can have either a one-case reading or a multi-case reading. Contrary to Lin,
P&J point out that conditional sentences with an anaphoric pronoun in the consequent
clause can also have a multi-case reading, similar to the interpretation of sentences that
employ an anaphoric wh-phrase.3

In fact, C&H have noticed the possibility of using anaphoric pronouns in bare condi-
tionals, though they claim that in all the bare conditionals that allow wh-phrase/pronoun
alternations, there has to be a connective jiu ‘then’ in the consequent. For them, jiu is
optional in bare conditionals, and its presence signals a covert conditional morpheme
3 Some other authors also reported a wh-pronoun contrast. For instance, Wang (2006) claims that
a wh…wh conditional has a different meaning from a wh…pronoun conditional: the former
expresses universal quantiﬁcation, i.e., the set of individuals denoted by the ﬁrst wh-expression
is a subset of the set denoted by the second wh-expression, while the latter states that the
situation described by the second clause is a necessary consequence of the situation expressed
by the ﬁrst clause. It is not clear whether these two readings are really different. For us, the use
of a pronoun in the consequent clause is compatible with a universal reading, too.

ruguo ‘if’. This means that the sentences in (10) and (11) with pronouns in the con-
sequent are actually not bare conditionals but ruguo-conditionals with a covert ruguo,
which explains why a pronoun can be used in these sentences. However, a lot of exam-
ples can be found in which the anaphoric wh-phrase is interchangeable with a pronoun
even in the absence of the connective jiu. For instance, P&J’s examples in (12) have a
pronoun in the consequent of bare conditionals without jiu. A noticeable feature of these
examples is that they all seem to carry an imperative ﬂavour (p.c. Lisa Cheng), which
may be seen as a kind of additional contextual support for the use of pronouns in bare
conditionals, a less preferred option, according to P&J.

Wh/pronoun Alternations in Ruguo-Conditionals and Dou-Conditionals
C&H claim that the anaphoric element in the consequent clause of ruguo-conditionals
and dou-conditionals cannot be a wh-phrase. In contrast, P&J demonstrate that in both
types of conditionals, the use of a wh-phrase in the consequent is possible, as shown in
(13) for ruguo-conditionals and (14) for dou-conditionals. Other authors (e.g., Huang
2003, Wang 2006) have made similar observations.

It is worth mentioning that according to Lin (1996) a ruguo/yaoshi-conditional allows
a pronoun to be replaced by a wh-phrase in the consequent clause only if the wh-phrase in
the antecedent precedes ruguo/yaoshi ‘if’. Our examples in (13), as well as the examples
in (15) below, which are naturally occurring examples extracted from corpus by Chen
(2015), clearly show that ruguo can in fact precede the wh-phrase in the antecedent
clause when another corresponding wh-phrase occurs in the consequent clause. The
sentence (15c) is specially revealing, as it has both ruguo and dou co-occurring in the
same sentence but still allows a wh-phrase in the consequent clause.

2.3
Interim Summary
The empirical picture emerging from our survey of the relevant data seems to be that
in a Chinese conditional sentence, if a wh-phrase occurs in the antecedent clause as an
indeﬁnite, it is generally possible to use another wh-phrase or a pronoun as the anaphoric
element in the consequent clause, as schematized in (16) below, no matter what additional
element there is in the sentence, be it the connective jiu, the conditional morpheme
ruguo/yaoshi ‘if’, or the universal quantiﬁer dou ‘all’. Given the observations made
in this section, the distinction between bare conditionals and ruguo/dou-conditionals
becomes blurred. Irrespective of the types of conditionals, the pattern seems to be the
same, i.e., (16). The question then is whether there is still a need to distinguish the two
types of conditionals, if both behave in a similar way, and whether it is still true that
there exists a strict correspondence between sentence types and interpretation strategies,
as C&H claim.
(16) [antecedent …wh…] [consequent …wh/pronoun…]
Although the wh/pronoun alternation is generally possible in Chinese conditionals,
theparadigmsidentiﬁedbyC&H,webelieve,canonlyberegardedasthedefaultpatterns.
In other words, a bare conditional prefers wh-phrases to occur in pairs, while a ruguo/dou
conditional tends to use a pronoun in the consequent. Bare conditionals by default are
interpreted via unselective binding and ruguo/dou conditionals prefer to adopt the E-
type strategy. There is still a need to distinguish two types of conditionals, though the
difference does not lie in whether they allow wh/pronoun alternations or not, but in the

33
default option they take. Any deviation from the default patterns requires additional
contexts, as suggested by P&J.4 Earlier we saw that an imperative context allows a
pronoun to occur more easily in the consequent of a bare conditional. Another reliable
predictor of the possibility of wh/pronoun alternation is the presence of the connective
jiu ‘then’ in the consequent clause (cf. 10 and 11).
3
Can C&H’S Original Proposal Be Maintained?
C&H (2020) attempt to address the issues raised by P&J for their original proposal
concerning wh/pronoun alternations and the correspondence between sentence types
and interpretation strategies, and conclude that the additional data presented by P&J do
not actually pose a challenge to them. In this section, we will look at their responses in
detail to see if their original proposal remains unchallenged.
3.1
Bare Conditionals and Ruguo-Conditionals
The impossibility of using a pronoun in the consequent clause of bare condi-
tionals is explained in C&H (1996) as follows. In a tripartite quantiﬁed structure
‘NECx[…x…][…x…]’, if the variable in the consequent clause is realized as a pronoun,
it will be bound directly by the necessity operator in an A’-position, which amounts to
treating the pronoun as a resumptive pronoun. Given the assumption that there are no
true resumptive pronouns in Chinese, a pronoun used here is ungrammatical. Besides,
the pronoun cannot be bound by the ﬁrst variable introduced by the wh-phrase in the
antecedent clause, as the former is not accessible to the latter. Therefore, there is no way
in which the pronoun can be bound, and thus it is excluded from the consequent clause.
Several problems render this account untenable. C&H’s reasoning above yields
wrong predictions for English conditionals. They would predict that a pronoun in the
consequent clause of an English conditional sentence is also ruled out, since they assume
that like Chinese, English lacks true resumptive pronouns as well. Consequently, the pro-
noun it in a sentence If John owns a donkey, he beats it would have to be regarded as
a resumptive pronoun and thus ungrammatical. It is doubtful that the pronoun it here
is a resumptive pronoun, and the grammaticality of such typical donkey sentences sug-
gests that C&H’s account resorting to prohibition against resumptive pronouns is not on
the right track. In addition, the claim that the wh-phrase in the antecedent clause is not
accessible to the anaphoric pronoun in the consequent clause rests upon the assumption
that the pronoun is bound by the antecedent wh-phrase, which is not an accessible binder
in the sense of Higginbotham (1980). Under the Kamp-Heim theory, however, it is the
implicit necessity operator (or other adverbs of quantiﬁcation, if any) that binds both
variables. The classic DRT assumes that the antecedent NP is accessible to the anaphoric
NP if the latter occurs within the scope of the quantiﬁer that binds the former, so that
they can be translated using the same variable (cf. also Kadmon 2001). Therefore, it is
not the case that the antecedent wh-phrase is not accessible to the anaphoric pronoun in
4 Huang A. (2003) argues that there is only one type of Chinese conditionals based on the
assumption that a wh-phrase and a pronoun are freely interchangeable in the consequent clause
of all conditionals, which is not the case.

34
H. Pan and H. Kuang
a Chinese bare conditional, at least not in the sense of ‘accessibility’ in the Kamp-Heim
theory.
Recall that in both bare and ruguo-conditionals, the anaphoric element in the conse-
quent clause can take the form of either a wh-phrase or a pronoun, contrary to C&H’s
claim that bare conditionals only allow wh-phrases, and that ruguo-conditionals only
permit pronouns. C&H (2020) argue that the apparent exceptions are not problematic
for their proposal. As brieﬂy noted in Sect. 2, they point out that whenever the wh-phrase
in the consequent clause of a bare conditional can be replaced by a pronoun, the con-
nective jiu ‘then’ must be present. They think that the presence of jiu is indicative of
a covert ruguo ‘if’, and thus a bare conditional with jiu has an ambiguity: it can either
be a true bare conditional or a ruguo-conditional with a covert ruguo. Consequently, a
pronoun occurring in the consequent is not surprising, because with the pronoun, the
sentence is essentially a ruguo-conditional in disguise. According to this analysis, the
sentences in (10), repeated here as (17), with wh/pronoun alternations, can have either
one of the representations in (18). When a wh-phrase is used as the anaphoric element,
both wh-phrases are unselectively bound by the necessity operator (cf. 18a). When a pro-
noun is used, a covert ruguo is there to license the antecedent wh-phrase as an existential
quantiﬁer, and the pronoun is treated as an E-type pronoun (cf. 18b).

C&H further clarify that in a ruguo-conditional, the conditional morpheme ruguo
may, but does not have to, license a wh-phrase as an existential quantiﬁer. When it does,
the sentence is a ruguo-conditional. When it doesn’t, the sentence is a bare conditional,
with the two wh-phrases functioning as unselectively bound variables even in the pres-
ence of ruguo. Thus, a bare conditional is not necessarily bare in the sense that it does
not have jiu or ruguo, but simply is one in which the wh-phrase in the antecedent is not
licensed as an existential quantiﬁer and both wh-phrases are bound variables (cf. 20a).
Under this analysis, our earlier examples of ruguo-conditionals (13), repeated below as
(19), can have either (20a) or (20b) as their interpretations. Therefore, they argue that
there is in fact no alternation in (17) or (19), but simply an ambiguity of analysis, and
that their original theory can be maintained.

(20) a. NECi [ruguo…whi…] […whi…] 
b. [ruguo…∃xi…] […pronouni…] 
C&H’s reasoning above is based on an assumption that a wh-phrase in the consequent
clause of a conditional can only be interpreted as a bound variable, and a pronoun in a
similar environment can only be an E-type pronoun. This seems to be an ad hoc assump-
tion speciﬁcally made to accommodate the exceptions to their proposed paradigms.
There is no a priori reason to exclude the E-type interpretation for wh-phrases and the
bound variable interpretation for pronouns. If one follows C&H’s argument above, then
all that determines what interpretation strategy to be adopted for the anaphoric element
is its form: whenever a conditional has a pair of wh-phrases, they are unselectively bound
variables, and whenever it has a pronoun in the consequent, it is an E-type pronoun. For
this reason, C&H change the term ‘bare conditionals’ to ‘wh-wh conditionals’, and the
term ‘ruguo/dou-conditionals’ to ‘wh-pronoun conditionals’. A point to note, however,
is that C&H (2020) have changed from their original position of bare conditionals vs.
ruguo/dou-conditionals to wh-wh conditionals vs. wh-pronoun conditionals, which sug-
gests that they have abandoned their claim concerning the complementary distribution
of wh-phrases and pronouns in the consequent clause of the so-called two types of con-
ditionals, while they still hold that the correspondence exists between sentence types
and interpretation strategies, though under the new dichotomy: wh-wh conditionals vs.
wh-pronoun conditionals.
Perhaps the only evidence C&H gives for their presumption above is that in a bare
conditional with two wh-phrases, the one in the antecedent cannot be preceded by the
existential verb you ‘have’, and the wh-phrase in the antecedent of a ruguo-conditional
can be preﬁxed by you, as shown in (21). The contrast suggests that the wh-phrase in a
bare conditional cannot be an existential quantiﬁer, while the wh-phrase in the antecedent
of a ruguo-conditional must be a true existential quantiﬁer, with the anaphoric pronoun
in its consequent functioning as an E-type pronoun.

The contrast in (21) does not seem to be robust enough to draw any conclusive
generalization. One can in fact ﬁnd many examples with a pair of wh-phrases but having
you ‘have’ precede the ﬁrst wh-phrase, as in (22). If the existential verb you always marks
the following wh-phrase as an existential quantiﬁer, the wh-phrase in the consequent
would have to be analyzed as an E-type pronoun, contra the claim of C&H.

Moreover, we noted in Sect. 2 that a pronoun can replace a wh-phrase in the conse-
quent of a bare conditional even in the absence of jiu. The relevant examples are repeated
here as (23). This casts serious doubt on C&H’s claim that only conditionals with jiu
allow alternations with other anaphoric elements.

In addition, C&H’s assumption that the presence of jiu indicates a covert ruguo
is dubious. Ruguo can in general license a wh-phrase as an indeﬁnite, though jiu alone
cannotdoso,suggestingthatthelatterdoesnotalwayscollocatewithruguo.Thesentence
(24a), with the connective jiu, is interpreted as a question; if ruguo is added, the sentence
turns into a statement. (24a) and (24b) are thus not equivalent in meaning, which suggests
that (24a) does not have a covert ruguo despite the presence of jiu. Note also that many

Another Look at Chinese Donkey Sentences
37
bare conditionals with jiu do not actually allow the insertion of ruguo. For example, if
ruguo is added to (25a) and (26a), respectively, the sentences become ungrammatical (cf.
25b and 26b). Taken together, these examples indicate that there is no strong independent
evidence that jiu is always accompanied by ruguo, either overt or covert.

Another point to note is that the wh-phrase in the antecedent clause of a ruguo-
conditional need not be interpreted as an existential quantiﬁer, pace C&H, as it can be
interpreted as an indeﬁnite in the sense of Heim (1982), that is, a variable, to express a
rule-like statement. In this case, the ruguo-conditional actually employs the unselective
binding strategy, which suggests that it does not need to stick to the E-type pronoun
strategy, not consistent with C&H’s assumption.
3.2
Bare Conditionals Without Jiu
C&H (2020) maintain that only those bare conditionals with jiu allow the alternation
between wh-phrases and pronouns in their consequent clause, which is compatible with
their theory. Therefore, they consider examples without jiu that still allow wh-pronoun
alternations as a real challenge to their proposal. To accommodate these examples, C&H
argue that they are actually composed of two independent sentences in a sequence, i.e., a
rhetorical question followed by a suggestion/imperative. For them the sentences in (27)
can be paraphrased as in (28).

(C&H 2020, p.179)
C&H’s evidence for the analysis in (28) is based on intonational differences between
sentences in (27) and true bare conditionals. They note that the sentences in (27) can
be pronounced with a pause or a pause particle ‘a’ between the two component clauses.
Besides, they observe that the sentences in (27) with a pronoun in their consequent differ
from their counterparts with an anaphoric wh-phrase, as in (29), in that those in (29) must
be pronounced as a compact unit with no pause or pause particle. C&H thus attribute
to (29a) a structure like (30), in which the bare conditional as a whole functions as a
sentential subject.

The problem of this argument is three-fold. First, determining the sentence structure
based on intonation is not reliable. Although it is true that the sentences in (27) can
be uttered with a pause in-between, a true bare conditional (or wh-wh conditional, in
C&H’s (2020) term) can also be read with a pause, or even with a pause particle, as
demonstrated in (31). In fact, this applies to many sentences presented so far, and as
the sentence gets longer, it is quite natural to have a pause or pause particle between
component clauses. Hence, whether there is a pause or not is not a good indicator of
the interpretation strategy of the sentence in question. Second, even if one adopts the

structure in (30), that does not exclude the E-type strategy, since it can yield the same

Finally, although all the counterexamples provided by P&J seem to have an impera-
tive ﬂavor, which motivates C&H to provide the analysis in (28), examples which are not
imperatives can be easily found, as shown in (32). The second clauses of these sentences
are not likely to be taken as imperatives, because their subjects are not the addressee.
Note that these sentences do not have the connective jiu either, thus providing further
evidence against the claim that jiu is required for the use of pronouns.

C&H analyze the wh-phrase-containing antecedent clause in a dou-conditional as
question-denoting, with dou quantifying over its set of possible answers. P&J in fact do
not deny this possibility, as it is true that any plurality to the left of dou can be quantiﬁed
over by it. What they argue for instead is that the analysis in which the universal quantiﬁer
dou unselectively binds two individual variables, which yields the same truth conditions,
cannot be excluded.
C&H (2020) claim that in examples like (33), which are problematic for their theory,
the second wh-phrase has a (free choice) universal reading contributed by dou ‘all’.
According to them, (33a) is interpreted as “No matter who you show (it) to, everyone
will say that I meant well”, with “everyone” including the one you show (it) to. The
interpretation ‘for all x, if letting x look at it, x will say I meant well’, is an implication
of the universal reading. Suppose there are three individuals in the domain of discourse:
John, Tom, and Mary. The sentence (33a) under C&H’s analysis would mean “if you
show it to John, all the three people in question will say I meant well; and if you show
it to Tom, all the three people in question will say I meant well; and if you show it to
Mary, all the three people in question will say I meant well.” Although this reading may
well be available, the sentence also has a reading “for any one of the three people, if
you show it to him, the person you show it to (not all three) will say I meant well.” This
reading is a real interpretation of the sentence, not just an implication of the universal
(or free choice) interpretation of the second wh-phrase.
C&H’s interpretation of (33a) entails that everyone would say I meant well once a
single person among the three have looked at it. That this is not the only interpretation
of (33a) can be clearly seen with the continuation in (34), where it is explicitly denied
that all people will say I meant well when not all (but only some) people have looked
at it, as the sentence does not sound contradictory. In fact, the second wh-phrase is
interchangeable with the singular pronoun ta, as demonstrated in (33). The fact that the
singular pronoun cannot be quantiﬁed over by dou further suggests that it is incorrect to
say that the anaphoric reading of the second wh-phrase is an implication of the universal
force of the second wh-phrase quantiﬁed over by dou.

A similar observation can be made about our earlier examples in (14) and (15), some
of which are repeated below. (35) admits two readings. On one reading, everyone should
put on their clothes if any single person gets up. On the other reading, only the person
who gets up needs to put on his/her clothes. With the second reading, the sentence is
true if someone gets up but not all people put on their clothes. C&H’s analysis only
allows the ﬁrst reading of (35a), which will be false in this scenario, a clearly wrong
prediction. The co-varying interpretation of the two wh-phrases is even more prominent

for (36), which can be derived by having dou simultaneously binds the two wh-variables,
suggesting that unselective binding is also available to dou-conditionals.

Based on our discussion in this section, we conclude that C&H’s (2020) responses
to the challenges raised by P&J do not stand up to scrutiny, and that their proposal
including the revised one with the new dichotomy of wh-wh conditionals vs. wh-pronoun
conditionals remains problematic, as we have shown that both interpretation strategies
are available to both types of conditionals, which suggests that the correspondence does
not exist between sentence types and interpretation strategies, pace C&H.
4
The Bound Variable Hierarchy
In consideration of the various observations discussed in the last two sections, P&J argue
that there is no strict correlation between sentence types and interpretation strategies,
as claimed by C&H. Both unselective binding and the E-type strategy can be applied
to different types of conditionals. Besides, wh-phrases can take on an E-type interpre-
tation, while pronouns can also function as bound variables. They further argue that,
although wh-phrases and pronouns have interpretative ﬂexibility, they have their default
interpretations: wh-phrases tend to function as variables, and pronouns prefer the E-type
strategy in Chinese. Since bare conditionals prefer unselective binding and other types
of conditionals prefer the E-type strategy, it is more natural for wh-phrases to be used in
bare conditionals, and for pronouns to be used in dou/ruguo-conditionals.5
5 A reviewer asks why the default pattern should be the default pattern, but not the other way
round. We suspect that this has something to do with the function of the conditional morpheme
ruguo and the universal quantiﬁer dou. In the absence of such elements, a wh-phrase in the

4.1
One-Case Conditionals vs. Multi-case Conditionals
Kadmon (1987, 1990) observes that English conditionals can have two interpretations.
The conditional (37a) has a multi-case interpretation: it states that Sally is pleased about
each case/instance of a man walking in and sitting. In contrast, the prominent reading of
(37b) does not involve quantiﬁcation over cases, but simply states that if the antecedent
is a fact, the consequent is also a fact. Kadmon argues that English conditionals are in
principle ambiguous between these two interpretations, although one of them may be
more prominent for a particular conditional sentence.
(37) a. If a man walks in and he sits down, Sally is pleased.
b. If it is true that a man walked in and sits down, then Sally will be pleased.
(Kadmon 1987, p.223)
P&J note that both Chinese bare conditionals and ruguo-conditionals can have two
interpretations as well. Under one interpretation, the sentence talks about a general
situation (like a generic sentence), which is similar to the multi-case interpretation of
English conditionals; under the other reading, the sentence is concerned with a particular
situationorindividual,muchliketheone-caseinterpretation.6 Theyarguethatthegeneric
reading is derived by unselective binding, and the speciﬁc reading is generated by the
E-type strategy. For example, the sentence (38a) is likely to be interpreted generically,
talking about a general rule or regulation. In contrast, (38b) talks about a particular
individual who bought the wrong cake.

The multi-case reading is the prominent reading of the classic donkey sentences such
as If a famer owns a donkey, he beats it, which asserts that for every case of a farmer
antecedent clause takes on its default interpretation, i.e., a free variable, and the anaphoric wh-
phrase has to be a variable too. The conditional morpheme ruguo and the universal quantiﬁer
dou have the preferred option to license the wh-phrase in the antecedent clause as an existential
quantiﬁer, and the anaphoric element has to be an E-type pronoun then. In this light, ruguo
seems to differ from English if. The semantic contribution of an if-clause can be analyzed as
providing the restriction for a (overt or covert) quantiﬁer (Lewis 1975, Kratzer 1986), and the
morpheme if is semantically vacuous. But ruguo has an obvious role to play for determining
the interpretation of the wh-phrase in the antecedent clause.
6 Lin (1996) also observes that Chinese donkey conditionals have a multi-case or one-case
interpretation, but he differs from P&J (and this paper) in that he claims that pronouns are
incompatible with multi-case bare conditionals.

owning a donkey, he beats it. The semantics of such sentences can be given using unselec-
tive binding.7 Take the multi-case donkey conditional (38a) for an illustration. It can be
analyzed as having the implicit necessity operator unselectively bind the world variable
and the individual variable, as in (39a).8 On the other hand, the one-case interpretation
of (38b) can be derived by using the E-type strategy, as in (39b), where the necessity
operator binds only the world variable, so that the sentence does not involve multiple
instances of someone buying a wrong cake (in a world). Similarly, a ruguo-conditional
conditional admits two readings as well, as shown in (40), where (40a) corresponds to
the multi-case reading, and (40b), the one-case reading.

For dou-conditionals, P&J maintain that simply treating the wh-phrase as a variable
bound by dou ‘all’ yields the correct interpretation in (41a), which would be indis-
tinguishable from treating the wh-phrase-containing clause as a question in which the
wh-phrase functions as an existential quantiﬁer, and the pronoun is treated as an E-type
pronoun, shown in (41b).

in the event of p]
7 For multi-case conditionals, Heim (1990) argues that a DRT-style unselective binding analysis
and the alternative situation-based E-type analysis is semantically equivalent. (38a) thus can
also be analyzed as quantiﬁcation over minimal situations: each minimal situation s that contains
a person who wants this broken factory can be extended to a situation s’ in which I will give
the factory to that person in s. To the extent that the unselective binding analysis and the E-type
analysis handle multi-case conditionals equally well, there is no ground to exclude either one,
and this provides further support to our null hypothesis that both unselective binding and the
E-type strategies are possible.
8 We remain neutral as to the nature of the implicit operator in donkey conditional sentences (e.g.,
whether it is an implicit modal or adverb of quantiﬁcation), and simply follow Heim (1982) to
posit a necessity operator binding both the world variable and the individual variable.

44
H. Pan and H. Kuang
P&J summarize the idea above as the bound variable hierarchy in (42). The anaphoric
elements on the left are more suitable for being used as bound variables,9 and those on
the right is less suitable for being so used; on the other hand, the one on the right is
more suitable to be an E-type pronoun,10 and the one on the left is less so. Since the
hierarchy is taken to be the default pattern, exceptions to it are expected, though they
need additional contextual support.
(42) Bound Variable Hierarchy11
wh-phrases/reﬂexives >> pronouns/demonstratives
9 As the hierarchy makes it clear, wh-phrases in Mandarin are able to function as variables. A
reviewer raises a question concerning the status of wh-phrases as variables: what excludes the
wh-phrase from being bound by the subject quantiﬁer in (i) if it can be a variable? Previous works
(e.g., Huang 1982, Cheng 1991, Li 1992, Lin 1996) have shown that the non-interrogative use of
wh-phrases, especially their use as indeﬁnite NPs, is subject to certain licensing requirements.
Wh-indeﬁnites are like polarity items and typically occur in downward entailing environments.
Therefore, it is not the case that they can freely occur. The reviewer also wonders why the
bound variable reading of wh-phrases only appears in the conditional type of donkey sentences
instead of the relative clause type such as (ii). In a similar vein, the indeﬁnite wh-phrase cannot
be licensed in this case. In fact, if one follows Tsai’s (1994, 1999) proposal of wh-contruals,
even the interrogative wh-phrase is semantically a variable subject to binding from the question
operator directly merged in CP. In general, it seems that wh-phrases as variables must be bound
by A’-operators instead of nominal quantiﬁers.

10 A reviewer notes that Mandarin wh-phrases do not behave like pronouns outside bare condi-
tionals, as shown in (iii) and (iv), and doubts whether they have E-type interpretations. This
is in fact a welcome result for the bound variable hierarchy, since it dictates that wh-phrases
are less suitable and thus quite restricted for being used as E-type pronouns. A question worth
pursuing is how E-type wh-phrases are restricted. One may resort to a competition mechanism
and say that whenever a pronoun is available, a wh-phrase cannot be used as an E-type pronoun.

11 We thank a reviewer for raising a question about the nature and status of this hierarchy in natural
languages. Indeed, the precise nature of this proposed hierarchy and its empirical consequences
remain to be further investigated, but it seems necessary to restrict its application to languages
in which wh-phrases have the option to be used as indeﬁnites; otherwise, languages like English

4.2
Accounting for Wh/pronoun Alternations
It has been observed that pronouns in Mandarin differ from their English counterparts
in that they do not easily function as bound variables, even when c-commanded by
quantiﬁcational NP antecedents, and the bound variable use of pronouns is subject to
some syntactic constraint (cf. Huang 1987; Aoun and Li 1990, 1996).12 Thus, it is
justiﬁed to say that pronouns rank lower in the bound variable hierarchy, and that they
are preferably used as unbound or referential pronouns.
Apart from this hierarchy, the well-formedness of a donkey sentence in Chinese
is also affected by discourse coherence requirement. The idea is that the two clauses
of a conditional sentence need to have some sort of connection to be interpreted as a
coherent mini-discourse; otherwise, the sentence can be understood to consist of two
independent sentences, resulting in a degraded status for being a conditional. A primitive
bare conditional like (1a), repeated as (43) below, does not allow the wh-phrase in the
consequent clause to alternate with a pronoun. The unacceptability of the pronoun can
be understood in the following way (see also P&J). Since the bare conditional does not
have any marker indicating the connection between the two clauses and a pronoun is
more likely to be used freely, the two clauses thus have the preferable option of being
understood as two independent sentences; therefore, the whole discourse consisting of
the two clauses will not be considered as a conditional. When a sentence connective like
jiu is added, the connection between the two clauses is then established and a pronoun
becomes much better in the consequent. The conditional morpheme ruguo/yaoshi ‘if’
by default licenses a following wh-phrase as an existential quantiﬁer, and consequently
a pronoun is the preferred option.
(43) Shei xian lai,
shei/*ta xian chi.
who first come who/he
first eat
‘If X comes first, X eats first.’
In connection with discourse coherence, it should be noted that it is not the case that
any two wh-clauses can be conjoined to form a bare conditional. The examples in (44)
are unacceptable. The intuition is that in both examples the two component clauses lack
connection so that they are likely to be interpreted as two independent sentences. If a
sentence connective jiu ‘then’ is added to link the two clauses, these examples become
grammatical (cf. 45).
in which wh-phrases are more operator-like would be predicted to have bare conditionals as
well.
12 Native speaker’s judgments on whether Chinese pronouns can function as bound variables when
c-commanded by quantiﬁcational NPs seem to show some variation, though, in general, the
bound variable use of Chinese pronouns do not sound as natural as their English counterparts.

Other Types of Anaphoric Elements
Chinese seems to make special use of a pair of identical NPs to express a general rule or
regulation. In addition to pairs of wh-phrases, one can also resort to pairs of indeﬁnite
NPs (46) or reﬂexives (47) (cf. Wen 2006, Liu 2021).

Note that sentences in (46) and (47) have a very similar meaning to their bare con-
ditional counterparts, with indeﬁnite NPs or reﬂexives replaced by wh-phrases, as in
(48).

Universal NPs like mei-ge ren ‘everyone’ are also able to occur in pairs to convey a
meaning that is typical of bare conditionals, as shown in (49). Li and Pan (2022) argue
that the second universal NPs in the relevant sentences function as bound variables.

If one takes the wh-wh conditionals in (48) and those sentences in (46), (47), and (49)
to be cases that instantiate the same general strategy, i.e., by using pairs of identical NPs
to convey a sort of co-varying meaning, we have an answer to the question concerning
the occurrence of wh-indeﬁnites in the consequent clauses of conditionals (cf. Chierchia
2000, Liu 2017). The unselective binding account of wh-wh conditionals assumes that
wh-phrases are indeﬁnites functioning as variables, but a wh-phrase is licensed as an
indeﬁnite typically in downward entailing environments such as the antecedent of con-
ditionals, instead of upward entailing environments like the consequent of conditionals.
It is mysterious why a wh-indeﬁnite can occur in the consequent of a conditional.
Another puzzling aspect of Chinese bare conditionals is that the wh-indeﬁnite in the
consequent has to be anaphoric to the wh-phrase in the antecedent rather than introducing
a new discourse referent, which violates the novelty condition of Heim (1982). This
motivates Chierchia (2000) to argue that Mandarin wh-phrases are indeﬁnite pronouns,
or leads to some other approaches to bare conditionals, like the question-based approach
(Liu 2017). However, if one considers data beyond wh-wh conditionals, such as sentences
in (46), where an indeﬁnite yi-ge NP ‘one NP’ appears in the antecedent as well as in
the consequent, the occurrence of wh-indeﬁnites in the consequent no longer seems to
be that mysterious. No one would doubt that NPs like yi-ge ren ‘one person’ are genuine
indeﬁnite NPs. Treating wh-wh conditionals as a different type of sentence than those
in (46) and (47) would miss a more general picture: Chinese seems to have a special
device of using pairs of identical NPs to express a co-varying meaning, each of these
NPs semantically functioning as bound variables. Of course, not all sentences with two

48

identical NPs are well-formed under such a use, but the strategy is quite productive.
Looked at in this way, the sentences with two identical NPs can be subsumed under
the same sentence type as wh-wh conditionals, all of which use unselective binding to
achieve the co-varying interpretation.
It is also possible to use two pronouns in a bare conditional, although they have
to be null pronouns, as demonstrated by the contrast in (50). C&H (2020) challenge
P&J by arguing that (50b) should be grammatical if pronouns can function as bound
variables in conditionals. But in fact (50b) is not problematic for P&J, because as the
bound variable hierarchy dictates, the overt pronoun ta ‘he’ is by default interpreted as
a free pronoun, and therefore cannot be used in bare conditionals if no other contextual
support is provided. Moreover, it is stipulated in DRT that pronouns (and other deﬁnite
NPs) are subject to a familiarity condition, and as such the ﬁrst pronoun in (50b) cannot
introduce a discourse referent. On the other hand, null pronouns are perfectly suited to
be variables. The contrast in (50) is paralleled by (51), where the overt pronoun cannot
function as a variable bound by the quantiﬁcational NP antecedent, though the null
pronoun can happily do so.

How could one make sense of the use of identical NPs? The essence of the DRT
account of anaphora is to model it as the co-variation of occurrences of the same variable
through variable binding. The discourse referent introduced by the antecedent NP and
the anaphoric element are translated as the same variable bound by the same quantiﬁer,
and the semantic interpretation rule ensures that they are assigned values by the same
assignment function, and thus always co-vary. Identical NPs may be seen as a morpho-
logical marking of occurrences of the same variable, and in a sense, Chinese is more
logically transparent in that it wears semantic co-variation on its sleeve.13
13 That Chinese is more logically transparent seems to be a general property of the language,
and may also be reﬂected by another fact, namely that it obeys a Scope Isomorphism Principle
(Huang 1982, Lee 1986), which states that the surface c-command relation between logical
operators determines their scope relation.

Conclusion
In this paper, we ﬁrst reviewed C&H’s (1996) treatment of Chinese donkey sentences,
and discussed P&J’s (1997, 2015) objections to the alleged complementary distribution
between wh-phrases and pronouns in the consequent clause of donkey conditionals and
the claim that the two types of conditionals are associated with their own interpretation
strategies. We then focused on C&H’s (2020) defense of their 1996 proposal, in which
they brought up a new dichotomy of wh-wh conditionals vs. wh-pronoun conditionals,
replacing their original dichotomy of bare conditionals vs. ruguo/dou conditionals and
abandoning the complementary distribution between wh-phrases and pronouns in the
relevant consequent classes, though they still maintain that the correspondence exists
between sentence types and interpretation strategies. We have shown that C&H (2020)
have not really dismissed P&J’s objections, and their problems remain, that is, the cor-
respondence does not exist between sentence types and interpretation strategies. The
bound variable hierarchy, ﬁrst proposed in P&J, was employed to accommodate the
problematic data, and the discourse coherence relation helps explain why primitive bare
conditionals are not compatible with the pronoun ta. The take-home message is that the
null hypothesis of P&J can be maintained: that is, both wh-phrases and pronouns can
appear in the consequent clause of bare conditionals and ruguo/dou-conditionals, func-
tioning as bound variables and E-type pronouns, and both interpretation strategies are
employed by the two types of conditionals, though they have their default interpretation
strategy and the non-preferred strategy requires additional contextual support.

Abstract. Superlative modiﬁers (SMs) such as at least shows an intriguing ambi-
guity between a reading conveying speaker concession (CON) and an epistemic
reading conveying speaker ignorance (EPI). While it is an going debate on whether
such EPI-CON ambiguity should be a case of homophony (e.g., Nakanishi and
Rullmann 2009; Cohen and Krifka 2014) or arises from only one lexical entry
(Biezma 2013), it seems to receive relatively little attention on how an assertion
with at least under the two readings updates the discourse. This paper ﬁlls the
research gap by considering how an assertion with at least in the discourse fares
with respect to diagnostics of (not-)at-issue content, and presenting a pragmatic
analysis capturing their different discourse proﬁles under the system of conver-
sational scoreboard in Farkas and Bruce (2010) and subsequently developed by
others (e.g., Malamud and Stephenson 2015). In particular, the speaker is com-
mitted to both the truth of the prejacent and the falsity of the higher alternatives
under CON. By contrast, the speaker is only committed to the possibility that the
prejacent is true and the possibility that some higher alternative is true in sub-
sequent discourse. This modal ﬂavor of at least arises at the level of discourse,
rather than lexical semantics (e.g., via a covert epistemic modal). Finally, it is
shown that the pragmatic analysis can be extended to expressions in other lan-
guages such as Chinese zhishao ‘at least’, which also demonstrates the familiar
EPI-CON ambiguity.

Introduction
Nakanishi and Rullmann (2009) (henceforth N&R) observe that English sentences con-
taining at least can have two readings: an epistemic reading (EPI) and a concessive
reading (CON), the ﬁrst conveying ignorance on the part of the speaker about the actual
state of affairs and the second conveying an evaluation by the speaker about a settled fact.
Assuming a context in which there are three medals, the highest being gold, followed by
silver and then bronze, the examples in (1) can be used to illustrate the distinction. EPI
conveys that the speaker is sure that Mary won either a silver medal or a gold medal, but

cannot say anything more deﬁnitive. CON conveys that Mary’s winning a silver, while
less desirable than winning a gold medal, is better than her winning a bronze:1
(1)
a. Mary won at least a [silver]F medal
b. (Mary didn’t win a gold medal, but) at least she won a [silver]F medal.
EPI
CON
The use of at least signals that the prejacent is interpreted against other possible
propositions and that these propositions are ranked in order of preference. N&R note
that CON has a “settle-for-less” ﬂavor in the sense that it falls short of the intended
goal of winning the gold. EPI is neutral in the sense that there need not be any prior
expectations about what Mary would win, or whether she would anything.
This is also in evidence in statements with numerals, where the logic of numbers
determines the ranking between the relevant propositions. Assuming that we are talking
about a game of dice where the minimum someone can get is 1 and the maximum is
6, (2a) is consistent with Mary getting three, four, ﬁve or six; Instead, (2b) takes it as
settled that she did not get four or more, which would have been better, but indicates
that she could have got one or two, which would have been worse:
(2)
a. Mary got at least [three]F.
b. At least Mary got [three]F.
EPI
CON
More generally, while the source of the ranking between the prejacent and the alter-
natives may vary, the contribution of at least remains ﬁxed. It leads to two distinct
readings, EPI and CON.
It is an ongoing debate whether the two readings in question represent a case of
accidental homonymy or whether there is a deeper connection between them. N&R
considers the EPI-CON ambiguity as a case of homophony (see also Cohen and Krifka
2014), while Biezma (2013) suggests a uniﬁed account of the two readings. This paper
remains neutral on this debate while taking a closer look at the discourse proﬁle of
these two readings of at least with respect to the diagnostics of (not-)at-issue content,
considering how an assertion with at least on the two readings updates the discourse
and presenting a pragmatic analysis capturing their different discourse proﬁles under the
system of conversational scoreboard in Farkas and Bruce (2010).
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the information
status of concessive at least and epistemic at least, serving as an empirical background
1 Kay (1992: 311) distinguishes three uses of at least in English: a scalar use, an evaluative use
and a rhetorical use. The three uses are illustrated in (i).
(i)
a. Mary received calls from at least three soldiers.
b. At least, this one is cooked.
c. I see her every day, at least when I’m in town.

Kay’s scalar use corresponds to N&R’s EPI and his evaluative use corresponds to N&R’s
CON. This paper is concerned with the discourse proﬁle of these two uses of at least.

for the pragmatic analysis in terms of conversational scoreboard to be presented in
Sect. 3. Section 4 brieﬂy discusses Chinese zhishao ‘at least’, which also shows the
familiar EPI-CON ambiguity. Section 5 is the conclusion.

The Discourse Proﬁle of At Least
This section proceeds as follows. Section 2.1 introduces the distinction between at-issue
and not-at-issue information content, and Sects. 2.2 # 2.3 present empirical facts that
(a) under both readings, the information content of the prejacent is always at-issue; (b)
under both readings, the information content of the lower alternatives is at-issue; (c)
under both readings, the information content of the ranking between the prejacent and
its alternatives seems to be not-at-issue; (d) under CON, the information content of the
higher alternatives can be at-issue or not-at-issue; while under EPI, it is at-issue; (e)
the speaker’s discourse commitments are different under the two readings: under CON,
the speaker is committed to both the truth of the prejacent and the falsity of the higher
alternatives; by contrast, under EPI, the speaker is tentatively committed to the truth of
the prejacent or the higher alternatives.
2.1
At-Issue vs. Not-At-Issue Content
Recent studies on appositves, evidentials, and expressives among other expressions, have
motivate the view that it is necessary to distinguish meaning contributions further than
our traditional categories of what is asserted, what is presupposed and what is impli-
cated (e.g., Potts 2005, 2007; McCready 2008, 2010; Simons et al. 2010; Murray 2010,
2014; AnderBois et al. 2010, 2015; Tonhauser 2012; Koev 2012, 2013; Tonhauser et al.
2013; Syrett and Koev 2015; among many others). In particular, many of these analyses
maintain a distinction in propositional content between what is at-issue and what is not-
at-issue. For example, Simons et al. (2010) suggests the following characterization of
the notion of at-issueness, within the framework of Question-Under-Discussion (QUD).
(1) The characterization of at-issueness (Simons et al. 2010: 323)
a. A proposition p is at-issue iff the speaker intends to address the QUD via ?p.
b. An intention to address the QUD via ?p is felicitous only if:
i.
?p is relevant to the QUD, and
ii. The speaker can reasonably expect the addressee to recognize this intention.
The deﬁnition of at-issue content in (1) suggests the following distinction between
at-issueness and non-at-issueness: A proposition expressed by a constituent is at-issue
if it contributes to the ordinary semantics of the clause in which it is located, and entails
that some possible answer to the QUD is false; otherwise the proposition is not at-issue.
Along this line of thought, Tonhauser (2012) further suggests three discourse properties
of at-issue content: (a) at-issue content can be directly assented or dissented with; (b) at-
issue content addresses the question-under-discussion; (c) at-issue content determines

Updating Contexts: Ignorance and Concession
55
the relevant set of alternatives. Given these discourse properties of at-issue content,
the following two tests have been applied to diagnose whether a given (propositional)
content is at-issue or not-at-issue in the discourse (Simons et al. 2010; AnderBois et al.
2010, 2015; Murray 2010, 2014; Tonhauser 2012; Koev 2012, 2013).
(2) Direct Response Test
Only at-issue content can be directly targeted by the addressee, e.g., by replies like
“Yes”, “No”, “That’s not true”, etc., in subsequent discourse.
(3) Answerability Test
Only at-issue content can be employed by interlocutors to answer questions.
Below, I brieﬂy illustrate how these two tests distinguish not-at-issue content from
at-issue content. Let’s ﬁrst consider the direct response test. In (4), speaker A’s utterance
containing a clause-medial appositive (i.e., who was talking to Mary a minute ago)
contributes to both at-issue meaning and not-at-issue meaning, as in (5). Crucially, at-
issue meanings are directly challengeable but not-at-issue meanings are not (as indicated
by speaker B”s reply). In this line, the example with expressives (i.e., that bastard) in
(6) makes the same point: speaker A’s utterance conveys a meaning that Bill is a bastard;
crucially, this meaning is not directly challengeable, in contrast to the at-issue meaning
that Bill stole my car.
(4) Clause-medial appositives (adapted from Koev 2012: (6))
A:
John, who was talking to Mary a minute ago, has gone home.
B:
No, he hasn’t. He is still at the party.
B’: #No, he wasn’t. He was talking to Stacy.
(5) a. At-issue meaning: John has gone home.
b. Not-at-issue meaning: John was walking to Mary a minute ago.
(6) Expressives (adapted from Potts 2007: 168)
A:
That bastard Bill stole my car.
B:
No, he didn’t. It was John that stole it.
B’: #No, he isn’t (a bastard). Bill is a very nice person.
(7) a. At-issue meaning: Bill stole my car.
b. Not-at-issue meaning: Bill is a bastard.
Next, let’s consider the answerability test. In (8), speaker B’s utterance containing
a clause-medial appositive (i.e., who had prostate cancer) contributes to both at-issue
meaning and not-at-issue meaning, as in (9). Crucially, only at-issue meaning can be

56
Y.-H. Chen
used as an answer to the question-under-discussion: even though the semantic content
of the appositive does answer the question, speaker B’s response (in contrast to speaker
B”s) is infelicitous in (8). Put differently, the test indicates that the semantic content of
the appositive is not-at-issue and thus cannot be used to answer questions.2
(8) Clause-medial appositives (borrowed from Koev 2012: (11))
A:
What disease did Tammy’s husband have?
B:
#Tammy’s husband, who had prostate cancer, was treated at the Dominican
Hospital.
B’: Tammy’s husband had prostate cancer.
(9) a. At-issue meaning: Tammy’s husband was treated at the Dominican Hospital.
b. Not-at-issue meaning: Tammy’s husband had prostate cancer.
Summing up, we have seen that (a) not-at-issue content cannot be directly assented or
dissented with, in contrast to at-issue content; (b) not-at-issue content cannot be used to
answer the QUDs, contrasting with at-issue content. Although at-issue content is roughly
what is proffered (contributed by a regular factual assertion), the group of expressions
contributingtonot-at-issuecontentisheterogeneous:itincludesappositives,expressives,
and among other expressions. In the next two subsections, we discuss how concessive
at least and epistemic at least fare with the two tests concerning the at-issueness vs.
not-at-issueness.
2.2
The Information Status of Concessive At Least
First of all, let us observe that under concessive at least, the propositional content of the
prejacent and that of its higher alternatives are both at-issue. Suppose that Adam, Bill
and Chris are the three relevant individuals in the discourse. Consider (10).
(10) A: Who did John invite? Did John invite Adam, Bill and Chris?
B: No, John didn’t invite Adam, Bill and Chris/everyone.
But, at least he invited [Adam and Bill]F.
In (10), speaker A explicitly raises an issue concerning whether the content of the
higher alternative (i.e., John invited Adam, Bill and Chris) is true and speaker B’s asser-
tion serves as a proposal to settle the raised issue. These discourse moves indicate that
the content of the higher alternative is at-issue (by the answerability test). In the same
2 Although the illustrated examples for the two diagnoses involve only expressives and apposi-
tives, expressions contributing to not-a-issue content go far beyond those two types; see Mur-
ray (2010, 2014) on evidentials, and Simons et al. (2010), Tonhauser (2012), Tonhauser et al.(
2013) on how and why projective content projects in general and how the projection behavior
is connected with information structure.

57
vein, the three possible responses (to speaker B’s assertion) in (11) # (13) further illus-
trate that not only the propositional content of the higher alternative, but also that of the
prejacent are at-issue (by the direct response test).
(11) C: That’s true!
(12) C: No, that’s not true! John only invited Adam.
(13) C: No, that’s not true! John invited all of them.
In (11), speaker C assents to speaker B’s assertion with respect to the content that the
higher alternative (i.e., John invited Adam, Bill and Chris) is false and that the prejacent
(i.e., John invited Adam and Bill) is true. This indicates that the propositional content of
the prejacent and that of its higher alternative are both at-issue. In (12), speaker C assents
to speaker B regarding the content that the higher alternative (i.e., John invited Adam,
Bill and Chris) is false, but dissents with speaker B from the content that the prejacent
is true. This again indicates that the propositional content of the prejacent and that of
its higher alternative are both at-issue. Crucially, notice that the lower alternative (i.e.,
John only invited Adam) is involved as part of speaker C’s response addressing speaker
A’s question. This indicates that the propositional content of the lower alternative is also
at-issue. Finally, in (13), speaker C dissents with speaker B on the content that the higher
alternative is false. This indicates that the propositional content of the higher alternative
is at-issue.3
Next, let us observe that while the propositional content of the prejacent remains
at-issue, the propositional content of the h
(14) A: Who did John invite for the party? Did he invite [Adam and Bill]F?
B: B: Yeah…, at least he invited [Adam and Bill]F.
C: Hey, wait a minute! You mean he didn’t invite (even) Chris?.
igher alternative can be not-at-issue. Suppose that Adam, Bill and Chris are the three
relevant individuals. Consider (14).
In (14), speaker A explicitly raises an issue concerning whether the content of the
prejacent (i.e., John invited Adam and Bill) is true and speaker B’s assertion serves as a
proposal to settle the raised issue. These discourse moves indicate that the content of the
prejacent is at-issue (by the answerability test). Crucially, speaker C is entitled to use
the phrase “hey, wait a minute” and conveys his surprise at the fact that the propositional
content of the higher alternative (i.e., John invited Adam, Bill and Chris) is false. The so-
called “hey, wait a minute” test is ﬁrst discussed in Shannon (1976) and later introduced
in von Fintel (2004) as a diagnostic of speaker presupposition. Below, (15) illustrates
the fact that at-issue content cannot enter into the frame “Hey, wait minute. I didn’t
know…”, in contrast to not-at-issue content (e.g., presuppositions among others).
3 In fact, the response in (13) can target either only the ﬁrst clause in (10B) or the ﬁrst clause
together with the latter clause containing at least. The discussion here is built on the latter
conversational situation. I thank one anonymous reviewer for dragging my attention to this
issue.

(15) Mary’s aunt is visiting today. (from Pearson 2010: (1))
a. #Hey, wait a minute! I didn’t know Mary’s aunt is visiting today.
b. Hey, wait a minute! I didn’t know Mary has an aunt.
(16) The (not-)at-issue content in (15)
a. Assertion (at-issue): Mary’s aunt is visiting today.
b. Presupposition (not-at-issue): Mary has an aunt.
Given examples like (15), the felicitous use of “Hey, wait minute” by speaker C in
(14) indicates that the information content that the higher alternative is false is not-at-
issue. Crucially, examples like (14) further suggest that the requirement of the concessive
reading that the higher alternatives are contextually known to be false should be speaker-
oriented, but not interlocutors-based (part of the common ground).
Below, (17) demonstrates that the information content that the higher alternative
(i.e., John invited Adam, Bill and Chris) is false can be part of the common ground for
the interlocutors in a given discourse. Note that like the conversation in (14), the polar
question by speaker A in (17) targets the content of the prejacent. (18) # (20) illustrate
three possible continuations (by speaker C) to speaker B’s assertion. Notice that (18)
and (19) are felicitous continuations, while (20) is not.
(17) Context: Speaker A wants to know who John invited for his party last night. All
the three speakers A, B and C know that John didn’t invite Chris. Speaker A is
interested in whether the other two people (i.e., Adam and Bill) are invited.
A: Who did John invite? Did John invite Adam and Bill?
B:
Yeah, at least he invited [Adam and Bill]F.
(18) C: That’s true!
(19) C: No, that’s not true! John only invited Adam.
(20) C: #No, that’s not true! John invited all of them.
Given the context, it is part of the common ground that the propositional content of
the higher alternative (i.e., John invited Adam, Bill and Chris) is false. More speciﬁcally,
the interlocutors are committed to the fact that the higher alternative is false. In (18),
speaker C assents with speaker B with respect to the content that the prejacent (i.e., John
invited Adam and Bill) is true. This indicates that the propositional content of the prejcent
is at-issue. In (19), speaker C dissents with speaker B on the content that the prejacent is
true. Notice that the lower alternative (i.e., John only invited Adam) is involved as part
of speaker C’s response addressing speaker A’s question. This indicates that besides the
prejacent, the content of the lower alternative is also at-issue. Finally, the assertion in
(20) is infelicitous because it is self-contradictory: given the common ground, speaker
C has committed herself to the fact that the content of the higher alternative (i.e., John
invited Adam, Bill and Chris) is false, but she continues to assert that the content of the
higher alternative is true.

59
At this point, it is worth noting that the information content regarding the ranking
between the prejacent and its alternatives seems to be not-at-issue, given that it cannot be
directly assented or dissented across the conversations we have seen above. For example,
(18) cannot target a meaning like “John’s inviting Adam, Bill and Chris is better than/
is ranked above his inviting (only) Adam and Bill”. Thus, I tentatively conclude that the
ranking information is not-at-issue, while the content of the prejacent is at-issue and that
of its higher alternatives can be at-issue or not-at-issue.
To sum up, we have seen that for concessive at least, the propositional content of
the prejacent is always at-issue, but the propositional content of the higher alternative
can be at-issue or not-at-issue, depending on the discourse. Put differently, under the
assertion with concessive at least, the speaker is committed to both the truth of the
prejacent and the falsity of the higher alternative; however, the discourse commitment
to the falsity of the higher alternative can be a result of the assertion (see (10)) or part
of the common ground (see (14) and (17)). Finally, the content of the lower alternative
is at-issue because it addresses the QUD (see (12) and (19)); the ranking between the
prejacent and its alternatives is not-at-issue because it cannot be directly assented or
dissented.
2.3
The Information Status of Epistemic At Least
Let us observe that under epistemic at least, the propositional content of the prejacent
and that of its higher alternatives are both at-issue. Suppose that Adam, Bill and Chris
are the three relevant individuals in the discourse. Consider (21).
(21) A: Who did John invite?
B: John invited at least [Adam and Bill]F.
In (21), speaker A explicitly raises an issue concerning who John invited; assuming
that the wh-question imposes an existential presupposition that John has invited someone
(e.g., Dayal 2016), the domain of speaker A’s question consists of a set of propositional
alternatives in the structure of a semi-lattice. Next, speaker B’s assertion serves as a pro-
posal to settle the raised issue. Crucially, the issue raised by speaker A is not completely
resolved under speaker B’s assertion, because there are two possibilities remaining open:
either John invited all the three individuals (Adam, Bill and Chris), or John (only) invited
Adam and Bill. In this sense, speaker B’s utterance with at least provides only a partial
answer. (22) presents an update of the domain.4
4 An anonymous reviewer points out that there is an entailment relation between the prejacent and
its higher alternative in (22).There are other cases where alternatives do not involve entailment:
John at least bought [apples]F (pragmatic scale) or John at least won a [silver]F medal (lexical
scale); however, in these cases, the fact that the speaker is committed to the possibility that the
prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher alternative is true in subsequent discourse,
still holds.

Recall that Tonhauser (2012) suggests three discourse properties of at-issue con-
tent: (a) at-issue content can be directly assented or dissented with; (b) at-issue content
addresses the question-under-discussion; (c) at-issue content determines the relevant set
of alternatives. According to properties (b) # (c) and (22), the alternatives in the domain
on which epistemic at least is operating, namely the prejacent and its higher/ lower
alternatives, all contribute to at-issue content (by the answerability test). Moreover, their
discourse property of at-issueness is further conﬁrmed by the fact that the alternatives
can be directly assented or dissented, as illustrated in (23) and (24).
(23) C: That’s true!
(24) C: No, that’s not true! John invited only Adam.
In (23), speaker C assents with speaker’s assertion with respect to the content that
either the prejacent or its higher alternative is true. In (24), speaker C dissents with
speaker B with respect to the content that the prejacent or its higher alternative is true.
Crucially, the lower alternative (i.e., John invited (only) Adam) is involved as part of
speaker C’s response addressing speaker A’s question. This indicates that the proposi-
tional content of the lower alternative is also at-issue. Taken together, these discourse
movesindicatethatthepropositionalcontentoftheprejacentandthoseofitshigher/lower
alternatives are all at-issue (by the direct response test).
So far, we have seen that the information content of the alternatives on which epis-
temic at least is operating are all at-issue. Now, let us consider what the speaker’s
discourse commitments are under epistemic at least. First, the two responses in (25)
and (26), where the prejacent or the higher alternative is targeted, are degraded or not
justiﬁed. In (25), speaker C challenges speaker B on the content that the prejacent is
true, while asserting that the content of the higher alternative is true. In (26), speaker C
challenges speaker B on the content that the higher alternative is true, while asserting
that the content of the prejacent is true.
(25) C: ?No, that’s not true! John invited all of them/ Adam, Bill and Chris.
(26) C: ?No, that’s not true! John invited (only) [Adam and Bill]F.
Second, when epistemic at least is absent in speaker B’s assertion, speaker C’s
challenge is akin to a contradiction. Consider (27).

Updating Contexts: Ignorance and Concession
61
(27) A: Who did John invite?
B: John invited [Adam and Bill]F.
C: #No, that’s not true! John invited [Adam and Bill]F.
The contrast on the degradedness of the objection between (25)/(26) and (27) sug-
gests that under the assertion with epistemic at least, speaker B does not fully commit
herself to the necessary truth of the prejacent and that of the higher alternative. Instead,
what speaker B is committed to seems to be the possibility that the prejacent is true and
the possibility that the higher alternative is true in subsequent discourse. I argue that
this is why epistemic at least has some ﬂavor of epistemic modals. More speciﬁcally,
the modal ﬂavor does not arise at the level of lexical semantics, but at the level of prag-
matics concerning the speaker’s commitments in the discourse. Seen in this light, the
task then is how to capture this modal ﬂavor without hard-wiring a modal component
into the meaning of SMs. Along this line of thought, the use of epistemic at least is
typically infelicitous when the speaker knows that the content of the prejacent is true or
the content of the higher alternative is true, as in (28) and (29).
(28) Context: Speaker B knows that John has won a silver medal in the race.
A: What medal did John win in the race?
B: #John won at least a [silver]F medal.
(29) Context: Speaker B knows that John has won a gold medal in the race.
A: What medal did John win in the race?
B: #John won at least a [silver]F medal.
In (28), the use of at least is infelicitous, presumably because the speaker could have
been more informative (using an alternative utterance John won a silver medal); put
differently, the possibility that John won a gold medal is unavailable in the discourse.
Similarly, the use of at least is infelicitous in (29), presumably because the speaker could
have been more informative (uttering John won a gold medal); again, the possibility that
John won a silver medal is unavailable in the discourse. Taken together, what (25)/(26)
and (28)/(29) show is that the use of epistemic at least is felicitous, only when the speaker
is ignorant about whether the prejacent is true and whether its higher alternative is true (if
themaximofquantityisactiveinthediscourse).5 Crucially,thisspeakerignoranceallows
5 There are cases where the speaker may not be ignorant when she uses epistemic at least.
Crucially, in those cases, the maxim of quantity is deactivated in the discourse, e.g., the scenario
of TV show repeated below; thus no ignorance inferences arise (see Mendia 2016a, b).
(i) Context: In a game, my friend has to guess the number of marbles that I have hidden. I know
how many I have hidden and she knows that I have that information. I provide the clue below:
I have at least ﬁve marbles.
~ > no ignorance about the number of marbles that I have.

the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher alternative to
both project in subsequent discourse.6
It has been noted in previous studies that SMs are compatible with partial ignorance
(Mendia 2016b, Schwarz 2016, among others). Speciﬁcally, the speaker may not be
completely ignorant when she uses epistemic at least, as shown below.
(30) A: How many apples did John buy yesterday?
B: John bought at least [three]F apples.
But I know that he didn’t buy {six/seven/eight…} apples.
(30) indicates that when using epistemic at least, the speaker may know that some of the
higher alternatives are false. I believe that the compatibility of SMs with partial ignorance
does not conﬂict with the conclusion drawn from examples like (28)/(29). In particular,
when there are multiple higher alternatives (as in the numeral case above), the speaker
may know that some of them, but crucially not all of them, are false in the discourse. In
contrast, however, when there is only one higher alternative, as in the case of plurality
scales (see (21)) or lexical scales (see (28) and (29)) above, the speaker would be ignorant
about whether the higher alternative is true. Taken together, I conclude that in any case,
when using epistemic at least, the speaker does not fully commit herself to the necessary
truth of the prejacent or its higher alternative(s); instead, what she is committed to is the
projection of the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher
alternative/some of the higher alternatives is/are true in subsequent discourse.
Finally, like the case of concessive at least, the information content regarding the
ranking between the prejacent and its alternatives seems to be not-at-issue under epis-
temic at least, as well. For example, (23) cannot target a meaning like “John’s invit-
ing Adam, Bill and Chris is better than/is ranked above his inviting (only) Adam and
Bill”. Therefore, I tentatively conclude that the ranking information is not-at-issue under
epistemic at least.
To sum up, we have seen that for epistemic at least, the propositional content of the
prejacent and its higher/lower alternatives are all at-issue, and the ranking information
between the prejacent and its alternatives is not-at-issue. Finally, the use of epistemic
at least is felicitous, only when the speaker is ignorant about whether the prejacent is
6 The same observation applies to disjunction, where in subsequent discourse, the content of each
disjunct must be (epistemically) possible to the speaker.

true and whether its higher alternative is true (if the maxim of quantity is active in the
discourse). Crucially, this speaker ignorance allows the possibility that the prejacent is
true and the possibility that the higher alternative to both project in subsequent discourse.
I consider that the projection of the two possibilities in subsequent discourse is the
source of the modal ﬂavor associated with SMs. However, I don’t analyze SMs as modal
expressions. Therefore, the task is then (a) how to capture the modal ﬂavor without
hardwiring a covert epistemic modal into the semantics of SMs; (b) how to capture the
intuition that the speaker does not fully commit herself to the necessary truth of either the
prejacent or its higher alternatives, and the intuition that what the speaker is committed to
are the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher alternative
is true in subsequent discourse.

(31) and (32) summarize the discourse proﬁle of concessive at least and epistemic at
least for the (not-)at-issueness and the speaker’s discourse commitments.
(31) Concessive at least
a. The prejacent is always at-issue, while the higher alternatives can be at-issue
or not-at-issue. The lower alternatives are at-issue.
b. The ranking information is not-at-issue.
c. The speaker is committed to both the falsity of the higher alternatives and the
truth of the prejaent.
(32) Epistemic At Least
a. The prejacent and the higher/lower alternatives are all at-issue.
b. The ranking information is not-at-issue.
c. The speaker does not fully commit herself to the necessary truth of either the
prejacent or the higher alternatives. Instead, what the speaker is committed to
is the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher
alternative is true in subsequent discourse.
The next section presents a pragmatic analysis capturing the two different discourse
proﬁles of at least under the framework of conversational scoreboard.

At Least in Conversational Scoreboard
This section proceeds as follows. Section 3.1 provides pragmatics preliminaries and
introduces the discourse model (in terms of the conversational scoreboard, with the
insights from Lewis 1979) presented by Farkas and Bruce (2010) and further developed
in Malamud and Stephenson (2015) and Beltrama (2018). Section 3.2 #3.3 present a
formal analysis of concessive at least and epistemic at least, capturing their different
discourse proﬁles in terms of conversational scoreboard.

Y.-H. Chen
3.1
Pragmatic Background: Conversational Scoreboard
In this paper, I adopt the idea that discourse is structured around one or more Question-
Under-Discussion (QUD; Roberts 1996/2012, Büring 2003, Beaver and Clark 2008,
amongothers;seeSect.4.1ontherelationbetweenQUDsandinformationfocus).Brieﬂy
put, a QUD is a (possibly implicit) question that amounts to a goal, at a stage of discourse:
cooperative interlocutors attempt to collectively resolve the current QUD(s). In a QUD-
based model, two types of core discourse moves can be made by a speaker; she can either
attempt to resolve some QUD by providing an answer, or raising an issue by positing a
(sub)question that could be used as a new QUD by discourse participants. For purposes
of this paper and simpliﬁcation, I ignore other types of discourse moves. Furthermore, I
follow Biezma and Rawlins (2017a, b) and others in assuming that questioning happens
against the background of a Stalnakerian common ground/context set and questions raise
issues that are not settled in the context set; in contrast, answers narrow the context set and
eliminate possibilities. One key idea behind the QUD-based viewpoint of discourse is the
notion of strategy: a strategy is (roughly) a discourse path toward resolving some QUD
by providing a partial/complete answer or by asking a subquestion. Finally, discourse
moves must be relevant. In this paper, I assume Roberts (1996/2012)’s characterization
of the notion of relevance, as shown below.
(33) Relevance (adapted from Roberts 1996/2012: (15))
A move M is Relevant to a question q iff M either introduces an (at least) partial
answer to q in context cM (M is an assertion) or is part of a strategy to answer q (M is a
question).
I further assume with Roberts (1996/2012) that the notion of partial answers and
complete answers are deﬁned in terms of contextual entailment. The deﬁnition below is
a modiﬁed version taken from Biezma and Rawlins (2017b: (48)).
(34) Partial answers and complete answers
a.
A partial answer to a question q is a proposition which contextually entails the
evaluation – either true or false – of at least one element of the alternative set
characterized by q.
b. A complete answer is a proposition which contextually entails an evaluation
for each element of the alternative set characterized by q.
c.
p contextually entails q in a context c just in case (p□csc) 5 (q□csc), where
csc is the Stalnakerian context set in context c.
d. p contextually entails the evaluation of q in context c iff either p contextually
entails q, or p contextually entails ]q.
According to the deﬁnitions above, a declarative response will be relevant if in a
context, it decides (either positively or negatively) any alternative in the current QUD.

Updating Contexts: Ignorance and Concession
65
With these pragmatic preliminaries, let’s turn to the discourse model presented by
Farkas and Bruce (2010) (henceforth F&B).7 A conversational state is represented in
F&B’s system by means of the following four main components.
(35) a. The participants’ discourse commitments (DCX): for each participant X,
X’s public discourse commitments.
b. Table: a stack of issues (the top issue ﬁrst), where issues are represented
as sets of propositions. Issues can remain on the Table only when they have
been raised by previous moves and have not been resolved yet (i.e., still “under
discussion”).
c. Common Ground (CG): the set of propositions that haven already been
publicly committed by all discourse participants (cf. Stalnaker 1978).
d. Projected CG (*CG; F&B’s Projected Set): the set of possible CGs that
give resolution(s) of the top issue on the Table in the expected next stage of the
conversation (i.e., in the felicitous continuations of the conversation).
A key feature of F&B’s system is that discourse moves, such as assertions and
questions, are distinguished by where their associated propositions are added in the
conversational scoreboard. For example, if speaker A asserts a proposition ϕ, then ϕ is
added to DCA, {ϕ} is added to the top of the Table, and ϕ is added to the projected CG
(i.e., CG*). If speaker B accepts the assertion (or has no objection to it), then {ϕ} is
removed from the Table and added to the CG.8 (36) illustrates how factual assertions
are computed in F&B’s system.9

7 Farkas and Bruce (2010)’s model is adopted here because I believe that it is more reader-friendly
and straightforward. The current analysis can be translated into an alternative discourse repre-
sentation where a context is considered as a tuple consisting of various discourse components
(e.g., commitment sets, the Table, CG, Projected CG, etc.) and various discourse moves are
deﬁned (e.g., push, pop, top, etc.); see Biezma and Rawlins (2017a) and Beltrama (2018) for
such discourse representation.
8 I follow the convention from F&B that when a proposition ϕ is added to the CG, it is also
simultaneously removed from any discourse participant’s commitment sets. This avoids redun-
dancy, because the CG represents the public commitments of every discourse participant in the
conversation.
9 I follow Malamud and Stephenson (2015)’s simpliﬁcation of F&B’s representation of the Table.
Under F&B’s original representation, items placed on the Table are pairs consisting of the
syntactic representation of the utterance and its denotation. Only the denotation is represented
here.

As shown above, once speaker B accepts the assertion, the new CG is obtained by
intersecting the input CG and the proposition {John left} (i.e., restricting CGi to those
worlds where the proposition that John left is true; in other words, removing those worlds
where John did not leave). On this view, crucially, assertions do not directly update the
CG; instead, they are seen as proposals to update the input CG, available for a variety
of reactions from other discourse participants.
Let’s consider another case discussed in F&B: polar questions. In contrast to the
assertion, a polar question creates projected CGs containing ϕ and those containing ]ϕ.
(37) illustrates how polar questions are computed in F&B’s system.

In F&B’s system, a polar question is distinguished from an assertion in three respects.
First, when a polar question is posited, what is being placed on the Table is a set consisting
of the proposition ϕ and its complement ]ϕ. Second, asking a polar question creates two
possible projected CGs: one in which ϕ is added and one in which ]ϕ is added. Third,
asking a polar question does not change the speaker’s discourse commitment sets.
Although F&B’s system has its merit of modeling basic discourse moves such as
(factual) assertions and questions, as discussed in Malamud and Stephenson (2015)
and Beltrama (2018), the original system is insufﬁcient (or not directly applicable) to
model more ﬁne-grained types of content (e.g., the interlocutors’ private doxastic states;
Farkas and Bruce 2010: 89) or various types of assertions (e.g., subjective assertions
with a judge parameter, and assertions with tentative commitments). In the case at hand,
it is not clear how to model the fact that under epistemic at least, the speaker does not

Updating Contexts: Ignorance and Concession
67
committ herself to the necessary truth of the prejacent or the higher alternative. Notice
that in F&B’s system, the four components are not completely independent of each other.
For example, as Malamud and Stephenson (2015: 286) has pointed out: “the commitment
sets and the Table completely determine the other elements of the scoreboard: the CG
consists of propositions that both (all) participants are committed to, while the projected
CG consists of these joint commitments updated with all possible resolutions to the issues
on the Table”. In order to model cases where the speaker may not be fully committed to
the propositional content that she asserts (i.e., assertions with tentative commitments),
Malamud and Stephenson (2015: 288) suggest adding “Projected Commitments” into
F&B’s original system.
(38) The participants’ projected commitments (DCX*): for each participant X, X’s
discourse commitments in the net expected stage of the conversation (i.e., the
felicitous continuations of the conversation).
Malamud and Stephenson (2015) posit sets of “projected commitments” of the
speaker and the hearer(s). According to them, the modiﬁed system is able to model dis-
course moves giving tentative commitments (i.e., by adding propositions to the speaker’s
projected commitment sets) or discourse moves offering the speaker’s best guess of other
participants’ commitments (i.e., by adding propositions to other participants’ projected
commitment sets).10 An important insight behind Malamud and Stephenson (2015)’s
idea of projected commitments is that adding propositions to the speaker’s projected
commitments leads to an inference of tentativeness. More speciﬁcally, given that the
speaker is always in full control of her own commitment sets, if the speaker chooses
to add propositions ϕ to her projected commitments but not her present commitments,
then the hearer is entitled to infer that the speaker has some reason to delay making her
present commitments. With no other obvious pragmatic reasons, typically, the hearer can
infer that the speaker thinks ϕ, but she is uncertain about ϕ. This licenses an inference
of tentativeness.
I follow Malamud and Stephenson (2015) in adding “projected commitments” into
the conversational scoreboard. For purposes of this paper, the hearer’s projected com-
mitments will not concern us. Instead, what matter to us will be the speaker’s projected
commitments. As we will see shortly, I suggest that the tentativeness is the pragmatic
source of the modal ﬂavor associated with epistemic at least. To anticipate, my proposal
in a nutshell is that although concessive at least and epistemic at least share one sin-
gle semantic representation, they have different discourse proﬁles and the discrepancy
in their discourse proﬁles crucially comes from where propositions are added in the
conversational scoreboard. More speciﬁcally, assertions with concessive at least add
propositions to the speaker’s present commitments, while assertions with epistemic at
least add propositions to the speaker’s projected commitments.
10 There is an asymmetry between regular present commitments (DCX) and projected commit-
ments (DCX*): a discourse move may add propositions to either the speaker’ or the hearer’s
projected commitment sets, but it can only add propositions to the speaker’s (but crucially not
the hearer’s) regular present commitments.

The next section presents a formal analysis of concessive at least capturing its dis-
course proﬁle and illustrates how assertions with concessive at least are computed in
terms of conversational scoreboard.
3.2
Concessive At Least
Let’s ﬁrst consider the case where the content of the prejacent and that of the higher
alternative are both at-issue. The relevant example is repeated below.
(39) A: Who did John invite? Did John invite Adam, Bill and Chris?
B: No, John didn’t invite Adam, Bill and Chris.
But, at least he invited [Adam and Bill]F.
To address the QUD (the issue raised by speaker A whether John invited Adam,
Bill and Chris), speaker B ﬁrst makes an assertion that John didn’t invite Adam, Bill
and Chris, and then makes another assertion with concessive at least that John invited
Adam and Bill. The former assertion amounts to a proposal to update the CG with the
content that the higher alternative is false, and the latter assertion a proposal to update
the CG with the content that the prejacent is true. With this in mind, the conversational
scoreboard in (40) illustrates how assertions with concessive at least are computed when
the content of the prejacent and the higher alternative is at-issue.

In (40), the speaker makes two proposals to update the CG: ]q and p. Therefore,
two propositions (i.e., ]q and p) are added to the speaker’s present commitments and
two items (i.e., {]q} and {p}) are placed on the Table. Assume that not-at-issue content
directly updates the input CG without being subject to the acceptance of other discourse
participants (e.g., AnderBois et al. 2010, 2015 on clause-medial appositives and Murray
2014 on evidentials), the information content of the ranking (i.e., q Bc p) is directly added
into the CG (i.e., CGi □{q Bc p}).11 Finally, the projected CG is obtained by intersecting

presuppositions); they need to be new information. I leave open the possibility that ranking
information is actually a presupposition in the discourse.

the input CG (with the added not-at-issue content) and the two propositions (i.e., (CGi
□{q Bc p}) □{]q} □{p}). Given the conversational scoreboard in (40), the concessive
meaning comes from the fact that q is higher ranked than p in the context c (with some
additional pragmatic attachment of preference), but q is false and p is true. Moreover,
it captures our intuition that under concessive at least, the speaker is committed to both
the falsity of the higher alternative and the truth of the prejacent, because both {]q} and
{p} are in the speaker’s present commitments.
Next, let’s turn to the case where the content of the prejacent is at-issue, but that of
the higher alternative is not-at-issue. The relevant example is repeated below.
(41) Context: Speaker A wants to know who John invited for his party last night. All
the three speakers A, B and C know that John didn’t invite Chris. Speaker A is
interested in whether the other two people (i.e., Adam and Bill) are invited.
(42) A: Who did John invite? Did John invite Adam and Bill?
B: Yeah, at least he invited [Adam and Bill]F.
In contrast to the previous example, to address the QUD (the issue raised by speaker
A whether John invited Adam and Bill), speaker B makes only one assertion with con-
cessive at least that John invited Adam and Bill. The conversational scoreboard in (43)
illustrates how assertions with concessive at least are computed when the content of the
prejacent is at-issue but that of the higher alternative is not-at-issue.

information content of the ranking (i.e., q Bc p) is not-at-issue and is thus directly added
into the CG (i.e., CGi □{q Bc p}). The projected CG is obtained by intersecting the
input CG (with the added not-at-issue content) and the proposition p (i.e., (CGi □{q

to both the falsity of the higher alternative and the truth of the prejacent, because {]q}
is part of CG and {p} is in the speaker’s present commitments.
3.3
Epistemic At Least
Recall that the use of epistemic at least is felicitous only when the speaker is ignorant
about whether the prejacent is true and whether its higher alternative is true (if the
maxim of quantity is active in the discourse). Crucially, this speaker ignorance allows
the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher alternative to
both project in subsequent discourse. This projection behavior of the two possibilities
in subsequent discourse is considered as the source of the modal ﬂavor associated with
SMs. Therefore, the main task of this section is to illustrate (a) how to capture the modal
ﬂavor of epistemic at least (more generally, SMs) at the level of discourse; (b) how to
capture the intuition that the speaker does not fully commit herself to the necessary truth
of either the prejacent or the higher alternatives, and what the speaker is committed to
are the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the higher alternative
is true in subsequent discourse. A canonical example of epistemic at least is repeated
below.
(44) A: Who did John invite? B: John invited at least [Adam and Bill]F.
To address the QUD (the issue raised by speaker A concerning the individuals invited
by John), speaker B makes an assertion with epistemic at least that John invited Adam
and Bill. Crucially, the speaker’s assertion provides only a partial answer, because two
possibilities remain open in the discourse: (a) John invited Adam, Bill and Chris (i.e.,
the higher alternative); (b) John invited (only) Adam and Bill (i.e., the prejacent). With
the above in mind, (45) illustrates how assertions with epistemic at least are computed
under the conversational scoreboard.

71
In (45), the speaker makes two tentative proposals to update the CG: q and p. There-
fore, two items (i.e., {q} and {p}) are placed on the Table. However, two propositions
(i.e., q and p) are added to the speaker’s projected commitments, but crucially not to
the speaker’s present commitments. Assume that not-at-issue content directly updates
the input CG, the information content of the ranking (i.e., q Bc p) is directly added
into the CG (i.e., CGi □q Bc p}). Finally, the assertion with epistemic at least creates
two possible projected CGs: one in which {q} is added is obtained by intersecting the
input CG (with the added not-at-issue content) and the proposition q (i.e., (CGi □p{q
Bc}) □{q}); one in which {p} is added is obtained by intersecting the input CG (with
the added not-at-issue content) and the proposition p (i.e., (CGi □{q Bc p}) □{p}).
Given the conversational scoreboard in (45), the modal ﬂavor of epistemic at least comes
from the fact that both propositions p and q (the prejacnet and its higher alternative) are
projected in subsequent discourse, more speciﬁcally, in two different projected CGs.
Furthermore, it also captures the intuition that under epistemic at least, the speaker does
not fully commit herself to the necessary truth of either the prejacent or the higher alter-
natives (i.e., two items {q} and {p} are placed in DCA*); instead, what the speaker is
committed to are the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that the
higher alternative is true in subsequent discourse (i.e., {(CGi □{q □c p}) □{q}}, (CGi
□{q □c p}) □{p}}).
It is worth emphasizing that according to (45), assertions with epistemic at least are
both informative and inquisitive, namely, they have mixed properties of both assertions
and questions. On the one hand, they are informative because they are like (factual)
assertions in (a) updating the speaker’s commitment sets and (b) serving as a proposal
to update the CG (subject to other discourse participants’ acceptance). On the other hand,
they are inquisitive because they are like (polar) questions in creating multiple possible
projected CGs.
To appreciate the mixed properties of those assertions with epistemic at least, let’s
brieﬂy recall how assertions and polar questions are modeled in F&B’s system. For
(factual) assertions, if speaker A asserts a proposition ϕ, then ϕ is added to DCA, {ϕ} is
added to the top of the Table, and ϕ is added to the projected CG (i.e., CG*). If speaker
B accepts the assertion (or has no objection to it), then {ϕ} is removed from the Table
and added to the CG. In contrast, a polar question is distinguished from an assertion in
three respects. First, when a polar question is posited, what is being placed on the Table
is a set consisting of the proposition ϕ and its complement ]ϕ. Second, asking a polar
question creates two possible projected CGs: one in which ϕ is added and one in which
]ϕ is added. Third, asking a polar question does not change the speaker’s discourse
commitment sets.
Finally, I would like to highlight several important features of the current analysis:
(a) the modal ﬂavor associated with epistemic at least is not at the level of lexical
semantics (i.e., not via a covert epistemic modal), but lies in the level of discourse; (b)
assertions with epistemic at least add associated propositions to the speaker’s projected
commitments, crucially not to the speaker’s present commitments. This delay in making
a commitment (resulting in an inference of tentativeness/ uncertainty) constitutes one
pragmatic source of the modal ﬂavor; (c) under an assertion with epistemic at least,

72
Y.-H. Chen
multiple possible projected CGs are generated in the discourse, which constitutes another
pragmatic source of the modal ﬂavor; (d) assertions with epistemic at least are both
informative and inquisitive.

Chinese Zhishao ‘At Least’
Two key observations about EPI and CON (among others) discussed in Sect. 2 are: (a)
Under CON, the speaker is committed to both the truth of the prejacent and the falsity
of the higher alternatives; crucially, the latter information can be either at-issue (i.e.,
asserted by the speaker) or not-at-issue (e.g., part of the common ground); (b) Under
EPI, the speaker is only committed to the possibility that the prejacent is true and the
possibility that some higher alternative is true in subsequent discourse. Below, I show
that these discourse properties also hold for Chinese sentences with zhishao under the
two readings, which implicates that the proposed pragmatic analysis can be extended to
expressions in other languages such as zhishao.
First, (46) illustrates the fact that Chinese zhishao demonstrates the familiar EPI-
CON ambiguity: Under CON, (46) conveys that Zhangsan has written three novels,
though it is not the optimal but acceptable. Under EPI, (46) conveys that the speaker is
not sure exactly how many novels that Zhangsan has written.
(46) Zhangsan
zhishao
xie-le  
[san]F-ben-xiaoshuo.
EPI,
CON
Zhangsan

write-ASP three-CL-novel 
‘Zhangsan at least wrote three novels.’
Second, (47) shows that the falsity of the higher alternative can be simply at-issue
(i.e., inviting all pop stars we want), explicitly asserted by the speaker; by contrast, the
information content in question can be not at-issue (i.e., John did not invite everyone/
Chris), part of the common ground, as in (48).

whether the other two people (i.e., Adam and Bill) are invited.

Finally, (49) and (50) illustrate that in the conversation where zhishao (under EPI)
is used to signal the possibilities that the prejacent or the higher alternative is true in
subsequent discourse; it seems infelicitous (though not a contradiction) to challenge the
necessary truth of the prejacent and that of the higher alternative. Note that without
zhishao in (49), the challenge in (50a) would simply sound like a contradiction.
(49) A: What medal did Zhangsan win in the race?
B: Zhangsan

‘You are wrong! Zhangsan got a gold medal!’
The above discussion indicates that the pragmatic analysis based on conversational
scoreboard presented in this paper can be extended to Chinese zhishao as well, to capture
its different discourse proﬁles under the two readings. For reasons of space, I leave the
detailed formal implementation for another occasion.
5
Conclusions
This paper ﬁrst considered how an assertion with at least under two readings (EPI
and CON) fares with respect to diagnostics of (not-)at-issue content and updates the
discourse, and then presented a pragmatic analysis capturing their different discourse
proﬁles under the system of conversational scoreboard in Farkas and Bruce (2010) and
subsequently developed by others (e.g., Malamud and Stephenson 2015). In particular,
it was shown that the speaker is committed to both the truth of the prejacent and the
falsity of the higher alternatives under CON. By contrast, under EPI, the speaker is only
committed to the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that some higher
alternative is true in subsequent discourse. This modal ﬂavor of at least arises at the
level of discourse, rather than lexical semantics (e.g., via a covert epistemic modal).
Finally, it was suggested that the pragmatic analysis can be extended to expressions in
other languages such as Chinese zhishao ‘at least’, which also demonstrates the familiar
EPI-CON ambiguity.

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory
of Anaphora
Patrick D. Elliott(B)
Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany

Abstract. In this paper I develop a dynamic semantics for a ﬁrst-order
fragment, which incorporates insights from work on anaphora in logic,
and the trivalent approach to presupposition projection. The resulting
system—EDS—has interesting features which set it apart, both concep-
tually and empirically, from earlier iterations of dynamic semantics. Con-
ceptually, the meanings of the logical connectives are derived by systemat-
ically generalizing the Strong Kleene connectives into a dynamic setting—
the system is thereby predictive, drawing a tight connection between the
logic of presupposition projection and patterns of anaphoric accessibility.
On the empirical side, EDS diverges sharply from earlier proposals. In this
paper, I focus mainly on disjunction, arguing that EDS provides a simple
and elegant account of the dynamics of disjunction, including traditionally
problematic cases such as Partee disjunctions and program disjunctions.

Introduction
Dynamic theories of natural language semantics traﬃc in anaphoric infor-
mation. Pretty much everyone agrees that indeﬁnites and pronouns are
special—indeﬁnites introduce anaphoric information—Karttunen’s discourse ref-
erents [1]—and pronouns retrieve anaphoric information. A pertinent question
arises: to what extent to one needs to make reference to anaphoric informa-
tion in the semantics of other expressions, such as logical vocabulary (and, or,
etc.)? Many proposals submit that logical expressions may arbitrarily encode a
complex set of instructions for regulating the ﬂow of anaphoric information [2,3].
In this paper, I’ll develop a diﬀerent kind of dynamic semantics, taking
anaphoric dependencies in disjunctive sentences as a case study. I’ll maintain
the idea that indeﬁnites and pronouns are special, but I’ll explore the possibility
that we can make use of independently motivated machinery for explaining pre-
supposition projection—concretely, the Strong Kleene logic of indeterminacy—in
order to help us understand why diﬀerent logical expressions regulate anaphoric
information in just the way that they do.
In Sect. 2 I provide a brief précis of Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL) [3]. This
will serve two purposes:

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
77
1. The Strong Kleene dynamic logic which I develop in this paper will make use
of notions ﬁrst made precise in DPL.
2. DPL will serve as a good representative of (a certain family of) dynamic
theories of natural language semantics.
In Sect. 3 I’ll discuss empirical challenges for DPL, focusing on the internal
and external dynamics of disjunction. This naturally leads into Sect. 4, where I
develop a new logic of anaphora: EDS. This logic is based on the idea that it’s
possible to embed the logic of presupposition projection into a dynamic setting
by computing three DPL-style meanings in tandem, corresponding to the three
truth values of trivalent logic. In Sect. 5, I embed EDS in a concrete discourse
pragmatics, by adopting Heim’s notion of an information state [2], together with
a concrete bridge principle. This will be essential in order to understand how the
permissiveness of EDS might be reigned in. Finally, in Sect. 6, I brieﬂy survey
some recent, related approaches to anaphora before concluding.

Dynamic Predicate Logic
DPL [3] provides a dynamic interpretation for a simple ﬁrst-order calculus. The
interpretation of a sentence is a relation between assignments—I will assume
some familiarity with DPL in this paper, so the presentation will remain rather
terse. Before sketching out the details, note that I depart in a couple of notable
ways from the presentation of Groenendijk and Stokhof [3] (henceforth G&S).
Firstly, following, e.g., van den Berg’s presentation, discourse referent introduc-
tion is cashed out as random assignment. Furthermore, DPL interpretations are
stated relative to a world of evaluation.1
(1)
Dynamic Predicate Logic:
a. if φ is atomic, then φw := { (g, h) | g = h ∧[φ]w,g is true }
b. εvw := { (g, h) | g[v]h }
c. φ ∧ψw := φw ◦ψw
d. ¬φw := { (g, h) | g = h ∧{ i | (g, i) ∈φw } = ∅}
Atomic sentences (1a) are tests, i.e., they do not introduce anaphoric infor-
mation, but merely assess (classical) truth with respect to an assignment g.
Random assignment (1b) is responsible for introducing anaphoric information:
εv is a privileged tautology, which in a dynamic setting means that for every
assignment g, there is some assignment h, s.t., (g, h) ∈εvw. Concretely, εv
indeterministically assigns a value to v—g[v]h holds just in case g and h diﬀer
at most in the value they assign to v. Random asignment is used to introduce
discourse referents, which are threaded from left-to-right via dynamic conjunc-
tion (1c), which is just relational composition.2 For example, the sentence “there
1 This will later prove useful when embedding EDS in a concrete discourse pragmatics.
2 The deﬁnition of relational composition (which is totally standard) is given below:
R ◦S := {(g, i)|∃h[(g, h) ∈R ∧(h, i) ∈S]}
This operation plays a central role in both DPL and EDS.

78
P. D. Elliott
is a bathroom” is translated into DPL as εv ∧B(v). The open sentence B(v) is
interpreted relative to the discourse referent introduced by random assignment,
thereby narrowing down assignments just to those that map v to a bathroom in
w. This is illustrated below in (2).
(2)
εv ∧B(x)w
a. = εvw ◦B(x)w
b. = { (g, h) | g[v]h } ◦{ (g, h) | g = h ∧g(v) ∈Iw(B) }
c. = { (g, h) | g[v]h ∧h(v) ∈Iw(B) }
More generally conjunction in DPL is associative, thanks to the associativity
of relational composition:
(3)
Associativity of dynamic conjunction (DPL):
φ ∧(ψ ∧σ) ⇐⇒(φ ∧ψ) ∧σ
Associativity, together with random assignment, underlies Egli’s theorem,
which ecapsulates the DPL account of discourse anaphora: “there is av bathroom,
and itv’s upstairs” is semantically equivalent to “there is av bathroom upstairs”
in DPL.
(4)
Egli’s theorem (DPL):
εv ∧(φ ∧ψ) ⇐⇒(εv ∧φ) ∧ψ
Dynamic negation (1d) will have an important role to play in the following
discussion, so it’s worth dwelling on. The deﬁnition of negation in DPL is tailored
to ensure that negative sentences are anaphorically inert. Concretely, negative
sentences are tests, which succeed if the scope φ is false with respect to an
assignment. This means that placing, e.g., (2) in the scope of negation results in
a sentence that is (a) anaphorically inert, and (b) has the truth-conditions of a
negative existential statement.
(5)
¬(εv ∧B(v))w
a. = { (g, h) | g = h ∧{ i | (g, i) ∈εv ∧B(v)w } = ∅}
b. = { (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(B) = ∅}
Existential quantiﬁcation is deﬁned syncategorematically in terms of random
assignment and dynamic conjunction (6a). Disjunction (6b) and implication (6c)
are deﬁned syncategorematically in terms of classically equivalent sentences. A
hallmark of DPL is that it matters exactly which classical equivalences one uses
to deﬁne these connectives—the choise is crucial for constraining the ﬂow of
anaphoric information in complex sentences.
(6)
DPL deﬁnitions
a. ∃vφ := εv ∧φ
b. φ ∨ψ := ¬(¬φ ∧¬ψ)
c. φ →ψ := ¬(φ ∧¬ψ)

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
79
Since disjunction is the primary focus of this paper, I’ll focus on (6b). Since a
disjunctive sentence is a negative sentence it is anaphorically inert—a discourse
referent introduced in a disjunction cannot be retrieved by a subsequent open
sentence. To use DPL terminology, disjunction is externally static (by way of
contrast, conjunction is externally dynamic). This is taken to be desirable, since
as noted by G&S, anaphora from out of a disjunctive sentence is seemingly
impossible in natural language:3
(7)
Either this house is derelict, or there’s av bathroom. #Itv’s upstairs.
Furthermore, since each disjunct is itself a negative sentence, each disjunct is
anaphorically inert, and therefore anaphora between disjuncts is impossible. In
DPL terminology, disjunction is internally static (again, conjunction in contrast
is internally dynamic). Similarly, G&S suggest that this is desirable on the basis
of natural language—the following example is from [4, p. 245].
(8)
#Either Jones owns av bicycle, or itv’s broken.
Implication will not be the main focus of this paper, but brieﬂy—DPL impli-
cation is tailored to derive universal readings for the famous case of Donkey
Sentences. I.e., (9) is taken to be equivalent to every bathroom is upstairs. More
generally, Egli’s corollory holds in DPL.4 With regards to anaphora, implication
is internally dynamic but externally static.
(9)
If there’s av bathroom, itv’s upstairs.
(10)
Egli’s corollary
∃xφ →ψ ⇐⇒∀x(φ →ψ)
DPL provides a simple and elegant logic of anaphoric information, but the
way in which disjunction and implication are deﬁned is rather ad hoc—as noted
previously, it really matters which classical equivalences one uses to deﬁne dis-
junction and implication, and which operations one takes to be basic. For exam-
ple, it wouldn’t do to take dynamic disjunction to be a basic operation, and
thereby deﬁne conjunction as ¬(¬φ ∨¬ψ) via de Morgan’s equivalence. This
would predict that anaphora should be impossible between conjuncts, despite
the fact that the truth-conditional import of such a conjunction would be clas-
sical. There is therefore no obvious way of determining the DPL semantics of a
logical operator given its truth-conditional import.
Furthermore, there are a multitude of possible connectives that are deﬁnable
in DPL which would manipulate anaphoric information in a way which wouldn’t
correspond to their language counterparts. I take that it would be desirable
to have a general recipe for determining how logical connectives manipulate
anaphoric information, on the basis of their truth-conditional contribution.
3 G&S importantly assume that a multi-sentence discourse is translated into DPL as
a conjunctive sentence.
4 N.b. the universal quantiﬁer is deﬁned as the dual of the existential.

80
P. D. Elliott
This is related to the explanatory problem for dynamic semantics, discussed
most frequently with respect to Heim’s satisfaction theory presupposition pro-
jection [5] (see, e.g., [6–9]). The conceptual problem is equally acute in the case
of anaphora, and unlike the case of presupposition projection, fewer alternatives
have been explored.5

Empirical Challenges
3.1
Double Negation
It has been continuously pointed out, including by G&S themselves and in much
subsequent work, that the empirical predictions made by DPL often do not
match up with our intuitions about natural language. The most straightforward
challenge is that, in DPL, Double Negation Elimination (DNE) isn’t valid. This is
because, since any negative sentence is a test, a doubly-negated sentence is always
a test. However, as pointed out by Krahmer and Muskens [15] and Gotham [16]
among others, doubly-negated sentences often license anaphora. The following
example is from [15].
(11)
It’s not true that John didn’t bring anv umbrella.
Itv was purple and stood in the hallway.
One desideratum of the account developed in Sect. 4 is to have a dynamic
logic in which DNE is valid. There are some potential objections which are worth
immediately addressing. Gotham [16] suggests that the facts are more nuanced,
in that doubly-negated sentences may carry inferences that their positive coun-
terparts lack. His example is given in (12). His point is that this discourse sounds
odd because it implies that John owns a single shirt; the conclusion is that ¬¬∃vφ
carries a uniqueness inference that ∃vφ lacks.
(12)
It’s not true that John doesn’t own av shirt. ?Itv’s in the wardrobe.
I however agree with Mandelkern (cited as p.c. in [16]) that it’s possible to
demonstrate that doubly-negated sentences do not systematically entail unique-
ness. This can be shown by using a generalization of Heim’s famous sage plant
example.
(13)
It’s not the case that Sue didn’t buy av sage plant.
In fact, she bought eight others along with itv!
5 As emphasized by Mandelkern and Rothschild [10] the kind of situation-based e-
type approach to anaphora developed in [11] and reﬁned in [12,13] does not (in
its current state, at least) consitute a viable alternative. E-type theories have not
addressed in detail how to capture notions of anaphoric accessibility in complex
sentences, beyond donkey sentences, and as shown in [14], were they to do so, they
would require entries for the logical connectives which manipulate minimal situations
in an apparently arbitrary fashion.

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
81
Moreover, the minimal positive counterpart of (12) to my ear also strongly
implies that John only owns a single shirt. It’s certainly an interesting question
to ask how exactly such uniqueness inferences arise, but for the purposes of this
paper, I’ll be setting them to one side.
(14)
John does own av shirt. ?Itv’s in the wardrobe.
Besides, developing a dynamic logic in which DNE is valid will have positive
ramiﬁcations elsewhere, for example in the treatment of disjunction. I take it that
developing a dynamic logic in which DNE is valid is a reasonable starting point;
doubly-negated sentences undoubtedly diﬀer from their positive counterparts in
certain respects, but this is somewhat unsurprising, especially from a Gricean
perspective.6 Having outlined the problems associated with negation in DPL, I
now turn to the main focus of this paper: disjunction.
3.2
Partee Disjunctions
As noted, DPL disjunction is internally static. A famous example originally
due to Barbara Partee (henceforth: Partee disjunctions) suggests that this isn’t
quite right for natural language. (15) is in a sense doubly surprising in the
context of DPL, since as well as seemingly involving an anaphoric dependency
between disjuncts, it also seemingly involves anaphoric information introduced
by a negative sentence (the ﬁrst disjunct).
(15)
Either there’s nov bathroom, or itv’s upstairs.
At this stage, it’s worth establishing some desiderata for the eventual treat-
ment of Partee disjunctions, since there is some disagreement in the literature on
their truth-conditions. For example, [15] suggests that (15) has universal truth
conditions, by analogy with the DPL treatment of donkey sentences. Their anal-
ysis predicts that (15) implies that every bathroom is upstairs. Related to the
discussion of double negation, Gotham claims that (15) carries a conditional
uniqueness inference, i.e., if there is a bathroom, then there is exactly one. Even
if universal/uniqueness readings exist, I argue here that both are at least some-
times too strong. Much like donkey sentences,7 Partee disjunctions can have
existential readings. (16) is true just in case (a) Gabe has no credit card, (b)
Gabe has at least one credit card and paid with one of his credit cards. Crucially
for the present point, (16) is true if Gabe has a credit card he paid with, and
one that he didn’t.
6 If φ and ¬¬φ are equivalent, then choosing to use a sentence of the form ¬¬φ is
naturally expected to trigger a Manner implicature. I leave the interesting question
of the pragmatics of doubly-negated sentences to future work.
7 (16) is in fact modelled after the following well-known example used to motivate
existential readings of donkey sentences (attributed by [17, p. 63] to Robin Cooper).
(1)
Yesterday, every person who had a credit card paid his Bill with it.
.

82
P. D. Elliott
(16)
Either Gabe doesn’t have a credit card, or he paid with it.
(16) is already incompatible with uniqueness given the provided context, but
just to drive home the point, I provide a disjunctive variant of Heim’s sage plant
sentence (following [10]).
(17)
Either Sue didn’t buy av sage plant,
or she bought eight others along with itv.
It’s important to mention at this point that the possibility of anaphora in
Partee disjunctions parallels facts concerning presupposition projection. Despite
the fact that the a deﬁnite description typically presupposes uniqueness, (18)
lacks a corresponding uniqueness inference.
(18)
Either there isn’t a bathroom, or the bathroom is upstairs.
The account of Partee disjunctions which I develop in Sect. 4 leans on this
parallel, ultimately unifying (15) and (18) by generalizing the Strong Kleene
logic of indeterminacy to a dynamic setting.
3.3
Program Disjunctions
G&S themselves observe that there are cases in which an externally static dis-
junction makes the wrong predictions. They give the example in (19)—more
generally, anaphora from out of a disjunctive sentence is possible when each
disjunct contains a parallel indeﬁnite.8
(19)
Av professor or anv assistant professor will attend the meeting of the
university board. Hev will report to the faculty.
They use this data to motivate a completely distinct disjunction operator,
which they dub program disjunction, which is internally static but externally
dynamic, and thus captures the data in (19) (although Partee disjunctions are
still out of reach). The details won’t be important for our purposes, but note that
the fact that an alternative, externally static semantics for disjunction is possible
in DPL conjures up the same conceptual worry that I’ve already raised—namely,
it’s not clear why logical expressions manipulate anaphoric information in just
the way that they do.
Moreover, once disjunction can be translated into an externally static oper-
ator, it’s not clear why it only occurs in the kind of instructions instantiated by
(19). If disjunction can be externally dynamic, why should anaphora be impossi-
ble out of a disjunctive sentence elsewhere? Ideally, one would settle on whether
the treatment of disjunction is externally static or dynamic. The semantics I’ll
ultimately end up with will be closer in spirit to G&S’s program disjunction.
In fact, it turns out that there is a problem with the data motivating G&S’s
externally static disjunction, which I turn to now.
8 This observation is often attributed to the later [18]. The intuition behind the anal-
ysis is already implied by the fact that the two indeﬁnites are annotates with the
same variable.

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
83
3.4
Anaphora and Contextual Entailment
G&S’s general project involves capturing surface generalizations about anaphora
in complex sentences by picking just the right semantics for logical expressions.
Rothschild [19] made an observation that shows that this simple picture over-
looks the important role of the discourse context. Consider: ordinarily, anaphora
out of a disjunctive sentence is impossible, as illustrated by (20).
(20)
Either it’s a weekday, or av critic is watching our play.
#Theyv look unhappy.
Rothschild points out that when a witness to the indeﬁnite is subsequently
(locally, in this case) contextually entailed, anaphora is possible.
(21)
Either it’s a weekday, or av critic is watching out play.
If it’s Saturday today, I want themv to give us a good review.
Elliott [20] shows that this a very general problem for DPL—other opera-
tors, which were thought to be externally static, such as implication, allow for
anaphora in similar circumstances; the ultimate suggestion is that a logic which
gives connectives an externally dynamic semantics by default is desirable. Later,
in Sect. 5, I’ll have more to say about how to account for restrictions on anaphora
out of disjunction.
Having surveyed some of the most pressing conceptual and empirical issues
for DPL,9 in the next section I begin to develop a new logic for anaphora, building
on the Strong Kleene logic of indeterminacy.

EDS
EDS stands for Existential Dynamic Semantics, or alternatively Externally-
Dynamic Dynamic Semantics, and it has some signature logical properties which
distinguish it from DPL and related theories. I’ll explore these properties in more
detail later, but brieﬂy:
– Double Negation Elimination is valid in EDS.
– Egli’s theorem doesn’t hold, but rather a weaker equivalence.
– De Morgan’s equivalences hold.
– The logical connectives are a generalization of the Strong Kleene trivalent
connectives into a dynamic setting.
9
For an excellent recent overview of DPL, which expands on many issues which I
don’t have the space to discuss here, see [21].

P. D. Elliott
4.1
The Basics
At the core of EDS is the idea that pronouns are variables which semantically
presuppose the existence of an assigned value at a given evaluation point (see
especially [22]). This is implemented in the logic formally by emulating partial
assignments using an privileged value in the domain of individuals #e, which
corresponds intuitively to the ‘unknown’ individual. Concretely, assignments are
total functions from a stock of variables to D ∪{#e}.
In order to simplify the presentation, I’ll consider a language with variables
and no constants. Since I emulate partiality via the unknown individual, an
atomic sentence φ receives the obvious (static) trivalent interpretation, where
the truth of the atomic sentence at g is unknown just in case the value of any of
the variables in the sentence is unknown at g. This is formalized below in (22),
where the third truth-value is unknown.10,11
(22)

and ⟨g(v1), . . . , g(vn)⟩∈Iw(P)
false
[P(v1, . . . , vn)]w,g is not unknown
and ⟨g(v1), . . . , g(vn)⟩/∈Iw(P)
There are a number of possibilities for making a DPL-style relational semantics
partial (see especially [24] for discussion). In EDS, the main innovation is that each
of the three truth-values in a trivalent logic corresponds to a DPL-style relational
meaning in a dynamic setting, i.e., it keeps track of anaphoric information asso-
ciated with veriﬁcation, falsiﬁcation, and the ‘unknown’ case in tandem.12 EDS
is therefore a trivalent logic; in order to formalize this idea, I recursively deﬁne
.w
+ , .w
−, .w
? , (corresponding to the true, false, and unknown respectively).
(23)
Atomic sentences in EDS
a. P(v1, . . . , vn)w
+ := { (g, h) | g = h ∧|P(v1, . . . , vn)|w,h is true }
10 Since I’m exclusively concerned with anaphoric presuppositions here, I make the
simplifying assumption that all predicates are bivalent, i.e., if all of the values of
the variables are known then an atomic sentence is always either true or false. One
way of extending the logical language in order to model (non-anaphoric) presupposi-
tions while maintaining bivalent predicates would be to incorporate Beaver’s unary
presupposition operator [23].
11 Note that there are diﬀerent ways in which to interpret the third truth value in a
trivalent setting, e.g., as standing in for undeﬁnedness. Here, it is explicitly referred
to as “unknown”, since this framing is a natural ﬁt for the Strong Kleene logic of
indeterminacy, which is exploited extensively later in the paper. Undeﬁnedness typ-
ically goes together with Weak Kleene logic. I’m grateful to an anonymous reviewer
for pressing me to clarify this point.
12 This builds on the dynamic system developed in [25,26], in which outputs are paired
with bivalent truth-values.

c. P(v1, . . . , vn)w
?
:= { (g, h) | g = h ∧|P(v1, . . . , vn)|w,h is unknown }
Since the logic is trivalent, I give explicit truth and falsity conditions. N.b.
that according to (24), a sentence with a free variable v will be unknown at g
if g(v) = #e.

b. [φ]w,g is false if [φ]w,g is not true and { h | (g, h) ∈φw
−} ̸= ∅
c. [φ]w,g is unknown otherwise
4.2
Negation
Negation in EDS is a ﬂip-ﬂop operator, deﬁned as in (25) (see also [15]). N.b.
that presuppositions project. This is a generalization of Strong Kleene negation,
in the sense that each cell in the Strong Kleene truth table is interpreted as a
DPL-style relational meaning, as opposed to a truth value.

+ := φw
−
b. ¬φw
−:= φw

c. ¬φw

?
It follows straightforwardly from the ﬂip-ﬂop deﬁnition that Double-Negation
Elimination is valid:
(26)
Double Negation in EDS: φ ⇐⇒¬¬φ
As I’ve already discussed, it seems desirable to have a dynamic logic in which
(26) holds. The statement of (25) is of course extremely straightforward. In the
following I’ll show that ﬂip-ﬂop negation makes good predictions in tandem with
the other logical operators, once deﬁned.
4.3
Connectives and Embedding Strong Kleene
Now for the logical connectives. I’ve gestured several times towards the idea
that the semantics of the logical connectives is a generalization of Strong Kleene
trivalent logic to a dynamic setting. It’s now time to make this idea precise. What
kind of information does a truth table encode for a binary connective ∗? Well,
given the truth values of two sentences φ, ψ it tells us how to compute the truth-
value of the complex sentence φ∗ψ. Each cell in a truth table therefore expresses
the result of apply some function from pairs of truth values, to truth values. In
a dynamic setting, the values of sentences φ, ψ are not truth-values but rather
relations. It’s therefore natural to interpret each cell in a truth table as specifying
a relational composition. The classical truth value tells us which polarity the

86
P. D. Elliott
resulting relation belongs to, on the basis of the polarities of the input relations.
Exactly how this works will become more readily apparent once I go through
some concrete examples, so let’s start with the simplest case: conjunction.
In Sect. 1, I give the Strong Kleene ‘truth-table’ for conjunction in EDS. Just
as in Strong Kleene semantics, a conjunctive sentence is only veriﬁed if both con-
juncts are veriﬁed, but here veriﬁcation is interpreted in a dynamic sense—in order
to compute the positive extension of the conjunctive sentence, compute the rela-
tional composition of the positive extensions of the conjuncts. Falsiﬁcation is a
weaker requirement—there are many diﬀerent ways in which conjunctive sentences
can be falsiﬁed in Strong Kleene logic, and in some cases one of the conjuncts is
unknown. The negative extension of the conjunctive sentence is the union of all of
the dynamic falsiﬁcations. The unknown extension is also computed by taking the
union of all of the unknown cases, computed dynamically.13
Fig. 1. Strong Kleene conjunction in EDS
EDS has a left-to-right bias directly encoded in the recipe it uses for lifting
Strong Kleene semantics into a dynamic setting, since relational composition
is non-commutative. Below, I write out the information encoded informally in
Fig. 1 as the semantics of conjunction in EDS.14

Before I discuss a concrete application, i.e., modelling discourse anaphora, a
remark is in order on the generality of this picture. As an anonymous reviewer
points out, the question of what kind of information a truth-table encodes of
course generalizes beyond just binary connectives. The picture outlined here can
13 The generalization of Strong Kleene trivalent semantics to a dynamic setting will out
of necessity remain rather impressionistic in this paper. The procedure of lifting truth-
functional operators into a dynamic setting has however been made precise in impor-
tant work by Charlow [26]. Simon Charlow (p.c.) points out that the recipe for lifting
the Strong Kleene semantics used here can be formalized as a lifting of the Strong
Kleene connectives into the State.Set applicative, following [26]. See [20] for more
details.
14 In order to keep the deﬁnitions relatively terse, I take advantage of the convention
that φw
+,−,? is understood as φw
+ ∪φw
−∪φw
? .

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora

be generalized as follows: one can think of a classical truth-table as encoding a
function f from a sequence of n truth-values to a truth-value (where n > 0).
The polarized dynamic interpretations that EDS deals in can in turn be encoded
as a pair consisting of a truth-value and a relation. For each ‘cell’ in a derived
dynamic truth table, I can state a general recipe: it takes as its input f, and a
sequence of polarized relation pairs, and gives back a polarized relation; this is
formalized below in (28). See [20] for more details.
(28)
f((t1, R1), . . . , (tn, Rn)) :=

(f(t1), R1)
n = 1
(f(t1, . . . , tn), R1 ◦. . . ◦Rn)
n > 1
Now let’s turn to a concrete appliation of the EDS semantics for conjunc-
tion: discourse anaphora. First let’s deﬁne discourse referent introduction in
EDS. Since negation is a ﬂip-ﬂop operator in EDS, it’s important to ensure that
a negated existential statement doesn’t introduce anaphoric information, while
preserving DNE. This is accomplished by syncategorematically deﬁning exis-
tential quantiﬁcation in terms of (a) conjunction (27), (b) DPL-style random
assignment (29), and (c) a ‘positive closure’ operator. Positive closure simply
ensures that its negative extension is always a test (i.e., anaphorically inert).
(29)
Random assigment in EDS

+ := { (g, h) | g[v]h }
b. εvw

+
b. †φw
−:= { (g, h) | g = h ∧[φ]w,g is false }
c. †φw
? := φw
?
Existential quantiﬁcation is deﬁned syncategorematically, just as in DPL but
with the addition of †.
(31)
Existential quantiﬁcation in EDS
∃vφ := †(εv ∧φ)
I’ll now establish some useful facts relating to the treatment of discourse
anaphora in EDS. Note that φ ∧ψw
+ is a simple relational composition. Con-
sequently, concentrating just on the positive extension, associativity holds (32),
and therefore the account of discourse anaphora from DPL is maintained. This
is easy to see, since the positive extension of random assignment is the same as
DPL random assignment, and positive closure is vacuous with respect to positive
extensions.

88
P. D. Elliott
The interaction between negation and discourse referent introduction is one
respect in which EDS substantially departs from DPL. In DPL, negative existen-
tial statements are anaphorically inert by dint of the special properties of nega-
tion. In EDS, conversely, negation is more classical—DNE is valid—and negated
existential statements are anaphorically inert by dint of the special properties
of positive closure, which ensures that an existential statement is a negative test
(i.e., its negative extension is a test). This is illustrated in (33).
(33)
Negative existential statements are negative tests:
∃vP(v)w
−
a. = †(εv ∧P(v))w
−
b. = { (g, h) | g = h ∧[εv ∧P(v)]w,g is false }
c. = { (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(P) = ∅}
There’s more to be said about the negative extension of conjunctive sen-
tences, where (as I’ll show), one observes failures of associativity. First though,
I’ll discuss the semantics of disjunction on EDS, illustrating how it resolves the
vexing problem of Partee disjunctions.
4.4
Disjunction
Just as with conjunction, the semantics of disjunction in EDS is a lifting of the
Strong Kleene trivalent semantics into a dynamic setting. This is illustrated in
Fig. 2. With conjunction, there was essentially one way of dynamically verifying
the sentence, but many ways of dynamically falsifying. With disjunction, the
situation is the reverse: there are many ways of dynamically verifying, but only
one way of dynamically falsifying.
Fig. 2. Strong Kleene disjunction in EDS
The Strong Kleene truth-table in Fig. 2, where each cell is interpreted as a
relational composition, corresponds to the EDS semantics of disjunction laid out
below.

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
89
The crucial insight which will underlie the account of Partee disjunctions
in EDS is that, one way of dynamically verifying a disjunctive sentence is by
composing the negative extension of the ﬁrst disjunct with the positive extension
of the second. In EDS, since DNE is valid, a negative extension can introduce
a discourse referent. In order to go through how this works, Il work through a
simple example (35).
(35)
Either there’s nov bathroom, or it’s upstairs.
¬∃vB(v) ∨U(v)
First, let’s spell out the negative and positive extensions of the ﬁrst disjunct;
the positive extension tests whether there are no bathrooms (thanks to positive
closure), and the negative extension introduces a bathroom discourse referent.
(36)
¬∃vB(v)w
+ = ∃vB(v)w
−= { (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(B) = ∅}
(37)
¬∃vB(v)w
−= ∃vB(v)w
+ = { (g, h) | g[v]h ∧h(v) ∈Iw(B) }
The second disjunct is an open sentence, so it has a standard trivalent test
semantics. In order to compute the positive extension of the disjunctive sentence,
I consider all ways of dynamically verifying the disjunction.
– One salient possibility is that one veriﬁes the disjunction by falsifying the
ﬁrst disjunct, and verifying the second disjunct. Falsifying the ﬁrst disjunct
introduces a bathroom discourse referent which is dynamically retrieved when
verifying the second disjunct (38).
– Another way of verifying the disjunction is by verifying the ﬁrst dis-
junct, in which case the second disjunct is irrelevant—this is captured in
Strong Kleene semantics, by taking the relational composition with the pos-
itive/negative/unknown extension of the second disjunct. Since the second
disjunct is a test, this is equivalent to the positive extension of the ﬁrst dis-
junct (39).
– Finally, I union everything together in (40).
(38)
¬∃vB(v)w
−◦U(v)w
+
= ∃vB(v)w
+ ◦U(v)w
+
= { (g, h) | g[v]h ∧hv ∈Iw(B) ∧hv ∈Iw(U) }
(39)
¬∃vB(v)w
+ ◦U(v)w
+,−,? = { (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(B) = ∅}
(40)
¬∃vB(v) ∨U(v)w
+ = { (g, h) | g[v]h ∧hv ∈Iw(B) ∧hv ∈Iw(U) }
∪{ (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(B) = ∅}
This captures the attested existential truth-conditions of Partee disjunctions,
which I argued for in Sect. 3.2; the positive extension of the Partee disjunction
will be non-empty if, either: (a) there is a bathroom upstair (in which case,
introduce a bathroom upstairs discourse referent), or (b) (there is no bathroom).
This is (arguably) a desirable result! There is however a pressing issue that
arises under the EDS semantics for disjunction, which underlies an apparent

90
P. D. Elliott
issue for the semantics more generally. Namely, Partee disjunctions conditionally
introduce discourse referents. More generally, our semantics for disjunction is
externally dynamic in the sense of [3]. This seems, on the face of it, incompatible
with the evidence that disjunction is externally static, as discussed way back in
Sect. 2.
Manifestations of this problem can be seen elsewhere. For example, although
I won’t discuss this in detail, de Morgan’s equivalences are valid in EDS.15
One consequence of this is that ¬∃vB(x) ∨U(x) is equivalent to ¬(∃vB(v) ∧
¬U(v)) via de Morgan’s and DNE. This means that negated conjunctions can
conditionally introduce discourse referents too. Another equivalent sentence in
EDS16 is ∃vB(x) →U(x)—similarly, G&S argue that material implication is
externally static, but in EDS the implicational sentence conditionally introduces
a discourse referent.
In the next section, I’ll show that, far from being a fatal problem, making
external dynamicity the ordinary case is a desirable feature for a dynamic logic.
I’ve already provided some empirical evidence for this in the form of program
disjunctions, discussed in Sect. 3.3, and Rothschild’s observation, discussed in
Sect. 3.4. EDS will capture both of these datapoints, while maintaining a certain
degree of restrictiveness, once integrated into a theory of discourse pragmatics.
15 I’ll simply note here that the validity of de Morgan’s in the presence of anaphoric
dependencies seems independently desirable given our intuitions about natural lan-
guage. The following sentences are all arguably truth-conditionally equivalent.
(1)
a. Either there’s no bathroom, or it’s upstairs.
b. It’s not the case that there’s a bathroom and it’s not upstairs.
c. If there’s a bathroom, then it’s upstairs.
16 Assuming a Strong Kleene semantics for material implication. Something interesting
to note here is that EDS predicts existential truth conditions for donkey sentences,
unlike, e.g., [3]. Egli’s corrolary therefore doesn’t hold.
This is by no means a bad prediction—it has been widely reported that such
existential readings are attested for donkey sentences, as alluded to in fn. 7 (see also
[17,27]). The following example, for example, is clearly true if Gabor owns two credit
cards but only pays with one of them.
(1)
If Gabor has ax credit card, he’ll pay with itx.
The empirical picture is however much more complicated, and donkey sentences
do often have stronger, universal readings. Relatedly, [15] reports that Partee dis-
junctions have universal readings—unlike donkey sentences, to my knowledge very
little work has been done examining the distribution of existential and universal
readings of Partee disjunctions. A detailed discussion of universal readings will have
to wait for another occasion, but see [28] for one recent approach.

Discourse Pragmatics
5.1
Update
In order to give an account of the dynamics of disjunction, it’s important to under-
stand how discourse referents are introduces in context. In certain dynamic theo-
ries, such as Heim’s File Change Semantics [2], the relationship between the seman-
tic value of φ and what it means to assert φ is almost trivial, since on such theories
sentences themselves denote updates on information states (see also [29]). Since
EDS is a relational theory, much like DPL, as well as encoding partiality, I need to
state a concrete bridge principle in order to integrate EDS with a Heimian notion
of information states. Update in EDS is deﬁned as in (41).
(41)
Update in EDS:
c[φ]
=
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩

(w,g)∈c
{ (w, h) | (g, h) ∈φw
+ }
∀(w, g) ∈c

[φ]w,g is true
or [φ]w,g is false
	
undeﬁned
otherwise
Here, I take information states to be sets of world-assignment pairs [2]. ‘Ini-
tial’ states (i.e., those where no discourse referents have been introduced) are
those paired with the unique assignment which maps every variable to #e (I’ll
write the initial assignment as []). Updating an information state c with a sen-
tence φ is deﬁned just in case φ is contextually bivalent.17 If deﬁned, the updated
information state is computed by gathering up, at each evaluation point i ∈c, the
positive extension of φ at i. EDS sentences therefore update information states
by (i) eliminating worldly possibilities, and (ii) introducing discourse referents,
i.e., expanding anaphoric possibilities.
An immediate consequence of the notion of update in (41) is that an open
sentence P(v) presupposes at c that v is ‘deﬁned’ at every evaluation point
i ∈c. This is exactly the notion of familiarity introduced by Heim [2,31], but
here derived from a partial DPL-like dynamic semantics plus a generalization of
Stalnaker’s bridge. To be precise: deﬁnedness is a condition placed on individual
evaluation points, whereas familiarity is a (derivative) universal condition placed
on the entire input context.
5.2
Disjunction and Contingency
Disjunctive assertions in natural language are subject to a contingency require-
ment (43). I state this formally as a felicity condition on assertion in (43), mak-
ing use of a notion of worldly content deﬁned in (42)—the idea here is just
that it’s possible to retrieve the ‘classical’ Stalnakerian content of a Heimian
17 This is what von Fintel calls ‘Stalnaker’s bridge’ [30], in the context of a dynamic
setting.

92
P. D. Elliott
information state. This captures the intuition that a disjunctive sentence cannot
be felicitously asserted if one of the disjuncts is contextually trivial.18
(42)
Worldly content: W(c) := { w | ∃g[(w, g) ∈c] }
(43)
Contingency requirement:
Assertion of a sentence of the form φ∨ψ is felicitous in c iﬀW(c[φ]) and
W(c[ψ]) are non-empty proper subsets of W(c).
The update rule in (41), together with the contingency requirement in (43)
accounts for G&S’s observations concerning the apparent external staticity of
disjunction, as well as Rothschild’s observation, discussed in Sect. 3.4. To see why,
consider the simple example in (44). The ﬁrst disjunct ∃vP(x) is contextually
trivial at c, unless some worlds in c are worlds s.t., Iw(P) = ∅. This guarantees
that, so long as (43) is satisﬁed, updating an information state with (44) will
result in an updated information state containing at least some non-P worlds,
where discourse referents aren’t introduced. This means that a subsequent open
sentence such as Q(v) cannot be felicitously asserted, since (44) can’t make v
familiar.
(44)
∃vP(v) ∨Q(a)
Crucially, if the non-P worlds are subsequently eliminated, v might become
familiar later in the discourse, for example if an assertion is made that con-
textually entails the ﬁrst disjunct. In this case, anaphora will be possible since
familiarity will be satisifed.
This general explanatory strategy can be extended to other apparently cases
of external staticity, once the contingency requirement in (43) is generalized to
other complex sentences. For example, assertion of sentences of the form ¬(φ∧ψ)
typically requires that ¬φ and ¬ψ are not contextually trivial.
One interesting thing to note is that the requirement as stated in (43) doesn’t
quite work as stated for Partee disjunctions, since it doesn’t take into account
the possibility of an anaphoric dependency between disjuncts. I address this issue
in detail in [32].
5.3
Program Disjunctions
I’m now in a position to explain why program disjunctions are an apparent
exception to the more general properties of disjunctive assertions in discourse.
Following Groenendijk and Stokhof’s DPL account [3], I assume that what makes
program disjunctions special is that each disjunct is an existential statement
18 Various pragmatic justiﬁcations can be given for the formal contingency requirement
stated in (43). What is important for my purposes is that if a disjunctive sentence
is asserted by a speaker s in a context which trivializes one of the disjuncts, the
assertion is judged to be ‘odd’.

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
93
introducing a discourse referent at the same variable. A schematic case is pro-
vided in (45). Unlike DPL, EDS accounts for the behavior of program disjunc-
tions without having to assume that disjunction is ambiguous between externally
static and externally dynamic variants.
(45)
∃vP(v) ∨∃vQ(v)
The contingency requirement insists that there be some P worlds, and some
non-P worlds in c for (45) to be assertable, as well as some Q-worlds, and some
non-Q worlds. Once (45) is asserted however, all non-P, non-Q worlds will be
eliminated. This leaves only P-worlds and Q-worlds, each of which is associated
with a discourse referent at v. (45) therefore makes v familiar, and subsequent
anaphora is (accurately) predicted to be possible by EDS.19
5.4
Internal Staticity
There is a loose end from Sect. 3 that I have yet to address in the more permissive
setting of EDS—namely, why is disjunction internally static? The problematic
data is given below.
(46)
#Either there’s av bathroom, or itv’s upstairs.
In fact, in order to capture Partee disjunctions, it seems essential to allow
for anaphoric information to pass between disjuncts, so (46) seems to constitute
something of a mystery. In fact, the infelicity of (46) in a context where v isn’t
familiar is expected on the basis of the contingency requirement. Consider the
LF of (46):
(47)
∃vB(v) ∨U(v)
If the ﬁrst disjunct is true, the second is contextually bivalent, but if the ﬁrst
disjunct is false, the truth of the second disjunct is partial, and dependent on
the input assignment. Eliding the full computation, the positive and negative
extensions of (47) is given below:
(48)
.w
+ = { (g, h) | g[v]h ∧g(v) ∈Iw(B) }
∪{ (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(B) = ∅∧h(v) ∈Iw(U) }
(49)
.w
−= { (g, h) | g = h ∧Iw(B) = ∅∧h(v) /∈Iw(U) }
19 There seem to be information-structural constraints on program disjunctions in nat-
ural language which are beyond the remit of EDS. For example, it seems that some
degree of parallelism is required to hold between the disjuncts. Singular anaphora,
by my reckoning, is extremely diﬃcult in the following example:
(1)
Either av linguist sneezed, or the meeting was interrupted by av philosopher.
?She was very rude.
I speculate that this is related to constraints on co-indexing. I leave this interesting
issue to future work on program disjunctions.

94
P. D. Elliott
For the disjunctive sentence to be assertable, every (w, g) ∈c should be such
that either w is a B-world, or w is a non-B world and g(v) is deﬁned. Given
the contingency requirement then (suitably generalized to allow for anaphoric
dependencies), there should be non-B parts of c, in which case (47) requires a
familiar discourse referent v in order to be assertable.
In fact, the empirical picture is potentially even more nuanced than this.
Filipe Hisao Kobayashi (p.c.) observes that anaphora seems to be possible in
(50).
(50)
Either there’s av bathroom upstairs, or itv’s downstairs.
Here I’ll tentatively suggest that the contrast between examples like (46)
and (50) is due to the diﬀerent Logical Forms available to existential statements.
Concretely, an existential statement in natural language can be translated either
as discourse anaphora (51a) or as a existentially-quantiﬁed formula (51b). In a
theory such as DPL, (51a) and (51b) are equivalent (Egli’s theorem). In EDS on
the other hand, (51a) and (51b) are positively equivalent but negatively distinct,
due to the fact that conjunction isn’t associative.20
(51)
a. ∃vB(v) ∧U(v)
b. ∃v(B(v) ∧U(v))
Concretely, the negative extension of (51b) is always a test, due to positive
closure taking widest scope. The negative extension of (51a) on the other hand
conditionally introduces a discourse referent. In (50), I conjecture, the ﬁrst dis-
junct is translated as in (51a). I leave a more detailed assessment of examples
such as (50) to future research.
6
Comparison to Alternatives
Although it will be impossible to provide a detailed comparison between EDS
and related proposals, some parallels and correspondences are worth mentioning.
The semantics of existential quantiﬁcation in EDS—decomposed into posi-
tive closure, conjunction, and random assignment, is closely related to the system
developed in Mandelkern’s work [33]. Mandelkern develops a logic of anaphora
which is bivalent and classical, but supplemented with an extra dimension of
meaning—witness bounds. The witness bounds of an existential statement ensure
that a discourse referent is conditionally introduced if there is a witness to
the existential statement, and thereby maintains external staticity of a negated
existential statement while validating DNE. The workings of witness bounds
are highly reminiscent of my positive closure operator, and there are other
compelling logical correspondences between my theory of Mandelkern’s which
20 This kind of suggestion raises the issue of how exactly natural language sentences
can be mapped compositionally to EDS Logical Forms. After all, one doesn’t want to
allow for too much ﬂexibility, otherwise the resulting grammar won’t be suﬃciently
constrained.

Disjunction in a Predictive Theory of Anaphora
95
deserve further exploration. One respect however in which the theories diverge is
that, in EDS, the familiarity requirement associated with a pronoun/free variable
is just an ordinary presupposition. In Mandelkern’s theory, the correspondence
between presupposition projection and anaphoric accessibility is not straightfor-
wardly captured.
Hofmann [34,35] tackles many of the same problems discussed here within the
context of a much more expressive system based on CDRT [36] and intensional-
ized discourse referents [37]. An appealing property of Hofmann’s system is that
it can handle modality and modal subordination. This is important in accounting
for certain cases of anaphora from out of a negative sentence, such as (52).
(52)
Colin doesn’t own av car, but itv would be a Subaru.
It remains to be seen to what extent Hofmann’s insights can be incorporated
into EDS, in order to expand its empirical remit.
Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention the connection between EDS
and earlier work by Rothschild [19], which also attempts to account for patterns
of anaphoric accessibility using the trivalent account presupposition projection,
and which thereby consistitutes an important precursor to EDS. There are a
couple of important diﬀerences between EDS and Rothschild’s proposal—here,
a left-to-right bias arises due to the way in which the Strong Kleene connectives
are lifted into a dynamic setting (i.e., using relational composition). On Roth-
schild’s account, the trivalent logic itself must be given a left-to-right bias [38–40]
in order to account for linear asymmetries in anaphora. Furthermore, in order
to account for, e.g., Partee disjunctions, Rothschild stipulates that classically
transparent material may be freely inserted into Logical Forms. This mechanism
is somewhat ad-hoc and leads to concerns of over-generation. EDS consistutes a
clear improvement, in the sense that Partee disjunctions are follow from standard
dynamic mechanisms for capturing cross-sentential anaphora.
7
Conclusion and Outlook
In this paper, I’ve sketched a new kind of dynamic logic: EDS. EDS incorporates
the insights of Groenendijk & Stokhof’s Dynamic Predicate Logic, and trivalent
approaches to presupposition projection. A core tenet of EDS is that the dynam-
ics of the logical connectives should not be stipulated, but rather arise as a gener-
alization of the Strong Kleene connectives into a dynamic setting. This approach
is conceptually appealing, as it maintains a certain degree of predictiveness while
establishing a tight connection between patterns of anaphoric accessibility and
presupposition projection, following, e.g., [19].
EDS is more classical than orthodox logics of anaphora such as DPL in
important respects—for example, DNE is valid. This is an important result,
as empirical evidence suggests that classical equivalences such as DNE and de
Morgan’s don’t break down in the presence of anaphoric dependencies. There are
also striking respects in which EDS diﬀers from DPL. To recap, neither Egli’s
theorem nor Egli’s corrolary hold in EDS. This is surprising, since Egli’s theorem

96
P. D. Elliott
is often framed as the central logical property of dynamic theories. Instead, a
weaker variant of Egli’s theorem holds, just with respect to positive extensions.
Another major departure is that EDS predicts existential readings across the
board, including for donkey sentences.
Much work remains to be done in investigating the inferential properties
of EDS, and extending the central ideas outlined here to a broader empirical
domain, encompassing quantiﬁcation, plurality, and modality.

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation
of Copies
Paul Law(B)

Abstract. We consider the relative scope of quantiﬁers, modals and negation in
A-movement. We present novel data suggesting that the apparent narrow scope of
the quantiﬁers with respect to the modal is due its logical relation with the wide
scope reading. We give the same account for the lack of narrow scope reading
with respect to negation. We claim that the narrow scope reading is possible
when it is logically implied by the wide scope reading. We argue that late merger
in extraposition has no effect on quantiﬁer scope. We resolve certain problems
arising from the interactions between scope and binding by differentiating lexical
features from morphosyntactic features. These are interpreted not all at the same
time but dynamically according to their relevance to the grammatical principles.

Introduction
Reconstruction is a phenomenon in which a displaced phrase behaves as if it is in its
original position. In (1a), the anaphor himself contained in the object can be bound by
the subject John, but that in the subject in (1b) cannot be bound by the object John:
(1) a. 
John told many stories about himself. 
b.  *Many stories about himself dumbfounded John. 
c. 
How many stories about himself did John tell? 
d. 
How many stories about himself did John tell <how many stories about 
himself>?
The reason for the contrast, simpliﬁed for our purposes here, is that the antecedent John
c-commands and therefore binds the anaphor in (1a), but does not do so in (1b). However,
if the object is fronted to a yet higher position than the subject as in (1c), the anaphor
contained in it can be bound by the subject. This phenomenon has been extensively
studied for decades [1, 9–13, 15, 20–23, 26, 27, 29–31]. A recent popular account is
the copy theory of movement [5], according to which a displaced phrase leaves behind
a copy of itself in the position from which it moves, represented in the angle-brackets,
as in (1d). When the copy in the original position is interpreted, the structure is exactly
like the one in (1a) where the anaphor is bound by the antecedent John.

The same account can be given to the raising example in (2a), an instance of A-
movement in contrast with A-bar-movement in (1c), to explain the scope ambiguity of
the sentence where the subject some senator may have either wide or narrow scope with
respect to the modal likely, indicated in (3b,c) respectively:
The syntactic representation of (2a) is given in (2d) where the displaced phrase some
senator leaves a copy of itself when it moves to the matrix clause. The wide scope
reading of some senator is the result of interpreting the upper copy, and the narrow
scope reading arises from interpreting the lower copy. The latter reading is commonly
known as scope reconstruction.
In this paper, we consider certain facts regarding the interactions between scope
reconstruction on the one hand, and negation and anaphoric binding on the other. The
interest of these facts is that they lead to a more reﬁned understanding of scope and
how the formal features in the copies are to be interpreted. We claim that in contrast
with A-bar-movement, only the highest copy of an A-moved phrase is interpreted (see
Sect. 6 for some qualiﬁcations). This amounts to the same idea that A-movement does
not reconstruct [9, 19] (Sect. 2). We argue that the narrow scope reading of the quantiﬁer
in cases like (2a) is not due to scope reconstruction, but is due to the logical relation
between it and the wide scope reading (Sect. 3). Our analysis strengthens the view
that A-movement does not reconstruct (Sect. 4). We further show that late merger of
adjuncts in extraposition has no effect on quantiﬁer scope (Sect. 5). We suggest that
formal features be differentiated as lexical features and morphosyntactic features. They
are not interpreted all at the same time, but are selectively interpreted according to their
being relevant to particular principles of grammar (Sect. 6).

Scope Reconstruction and Negation
Although the narrow scope reading of the quantiﬁer in (2a) can be accounted for by
interpreting the lower copy, the same interpretation would lead to unexpected results.
The example in (3a), differing from that in (2a) in the presence of negation in the
matrix clause, does not allow for a narrow scope reading of the quantiﬁer:1
1 Examples like (3a) with negation in the matrix clause contrast with those with negation in the
embedded clause that [6, 19] argue to be evidence against A-movement reconstruction (see
Sect. 4).

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
101
The difference between the reading in (3b) and the reading in (3c) is that the former
remains true in the case where some other senator is likely to support the motion, while
the latter denies the likelihood that some senator or other will support it.
The same can be said of the example in (4a). Without negation, both wide and narrow
scope readings are available:
(4) a. 
At least ten senators are likely to support the motion. 
b.
at-least-ten x, senator(x) (likely(x support the motion))
at least ten senators > likely
c.
likely(at least ten x, senator(x) (x support the motion))
likely > at least ten senators
 
d. 
At least ten senators are likely [ <at least ten senators> to support the  
 
 
motion ] 
The scope ambiguity in (4a) can be accounted for in exactly the same way as that in (2a).
However, as in (3a), the narrow scope reading of the quantiﬁer disappears when
negation is present in the matrix clause. The example in (5a) only has the reading in
which the quantiﬁer has wide scope over both negation and likely:
(5) a. 
At least ten senators are not likely to support the motion. 
b.
at-least-ten x, senator(x) (
likely(x supports the motion)))  
at least ten senators > not > likely
c.
likely(at-least-ten x, senator(x) (x supports the motion)))  
not > likely > at least ten senators
 
d. 
At least ten senators are not likely [ <at least ten senators> to support the  
 
motion ] 
The wide scope reading of the quantiﬁer in (5b) is true in a situation where at least ten
senators are not likely to support the motion but at least ten others are likely to support
it. The narrow scope of the quantiﬁer in (5c) is false in this situation.
The facts in (3a) and (5a) thus show that negation blocks scope reconstruction. If the
lower copy in the structures in (3d) and (5d) were to be interpreted, then these sentences
should have the narrow reading of the quantiﬁer, contrary to fact. It thus must be that
the lower copy of the quantiﬁer is not interpreted in these cases, amounting to the same
idea that A-movement mostly does not reconstruct ([5, 6, 20], though based on some
different facts [2, 9–12, 16, 19, 30], among many others). If so, then we must ask how
the narrow scope readings of the quantiﬁers in (2a) and (4a) arise, speciﬁcally, whether
they come about as a result of the lower copies being interpretable in the absence of
negation, or whether they arise in some other way.
It seems difﬁcult to entertain the ﬁrst view, for there is apparently no natural way to
explain why negation in the matrix clause should make it impossible to interpret the copy
in the embedded clause. We suggest that generally in A-movement only the highest copy
be interpreted (see Sect. 4 for some qualiﬁcations); the lack of the narrow scope reading

102
P. Law
in (3a) and (5a) is thus accounted for. This in turn means that we need to explain how
the sentences in (2a) and (4a) may have the narrow scope readings of the quantiﬁers.
For the sentences in (2a) and (4a), repeated in (6a) and (7a) respectively, it is clear that
their wide scope readings of the quantiﬁers logically imply their narrow scope readings
in (6b) and (7b) respectively:
(6) a. 
Some senator is likely to support the motion. 
(=(2a)) 
b.
 It is likely that some senator supports the motion. 
(7) a. 
At least ten senators are likely to support the motion. 
(=(4a)) 
b.
 It is likely that at least ten senators support the motion. 
That is, when the wide scope readings of the quantiﬁers are true, the narrow scope
readings are also true.
For the sentences in (8a) and (9a) with negation in the matrix clause, however, the
wide scope readings of the quantiﬁers do not logically imply the narrow scope readings:
(8) a. 
 Some senator is not likely to support the motion. 
(=(3a)) 
b.
 It is not likely that some senator supports the motion. 
(9) a. 
 At least ten senators are not likely to support the motion. 
(=(5a)) 
b.
It is not likely that at least ten senators support the motion. 
That is, when the wide scope readings of the quantiﬁers are true, the narrow scope
readings are false.
The issue that we need to address is why the narrow scope reading of the quantiﬁer
is possible in cases like (6a) and (7a), but not in case like (8a) and (9a).
3
Logical Relations Between the Wide and Narrow Scope Readings
Intuitively, when we ask whether a sentence allows a wide or narrow reading, we mean
whether the sentence is true in the conditions in which the wide or narrow reading is true.
Wide scope interpretation is always available, unless it is excluded by some independent
conditions. The narrow scope interpretation may but need not be true. For example,
sentence (6a) allows the narrow scope reading of the quantiﬁer since it is true in the
conditions in which the narrow scope reading in (6b) is true. By contrast, sentence (8a)
does not have the narrow scope reading, for it is false in the conditions in which the
narrow scope reading in (8b) is true.
Consider now the sentence in (10a) [11] and the wide scope reading of the quantiﬁer
in (10b) and the narrow scope reading in (10c):
(10) a. 
Someone from New Jersey is likely to win the lottery. 
b.
x, from-New-Jersey (x), likely(x wins the lottery))
> likely
c.
likely( x, from-New-Jersey (x), (x wins the lottery))
likely > 

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
103
In a situation where one out of ten tickets is drawn in a lottery, three individuals from
New York each bought one ticket, and one from New Jersey bought the remaining seven.
Both the wide and narrow scope in (10b,c) readings are true. However, in a situation
where seven individuals from New Jersey each bought one ticket, and one from New
York bought the remaining three, the wide scope reading in (10b) is false, but the narrow
scope reading in (10c) is true. Clearly it cannot be claimed that the narrow scope reading
is derived exclusively from the wide scope reading, for it may be true when the wide
scope reading is false.
We claim that a sentence allows for the narrow reading if logically it is materially
implied →by the wide scope reading. This is not the same as claiming that the narrow
scope reading is derived exclusively from the material implication from the wide scope
reading. In our view, we ﬁrst compute the wide and narrow scope readings of the sentence
and then see if the wide scope reading being true guarantees the narrow scope reading
being true. If it does, then the sentence allows for the narrow scope reading, i.e., the
sentence is true under the conditions in which the narrow scope reading is true. This
does not in any way exclude the case where the wide scope reading is false, but the
narrow scope reading is true, for the material implication still holds.
Our view explains the difference between the sentences in (6a) and (7a) and those
in (8a) and (9a) with respect to the narrow scope readings. On one hand, the wide scope
readings of the sentences in (6a) and (7a) materially imply the narrow scope readings
in (6b) and (7b) respectively; they thus allow for the narrow scope readings, i.e., the
sentences in (6a) and (7a) are true in the conditions in which the narrow scope readings
in (6b) and (7b) are true. On the other hand, the wide scope readings of the sentences
in (8a) and (9a) do not materially imply the narrow scope readings in (8b) and (9b)
respectively; hence, they do not allow for the narrow scope readings, i.e., the sentences
in (8a) and (9a) are not true in the conditions in which the narrow scope readings in (8b)
and (9b) are true.
Our analysis extends to the sentence in (11a) with the strong modal is-guaranteed
[2]:
(11) a. 
Someone from New York is guaranteed to win the lottery. 
b. It is guaranteed that someone from New York will win the lottery. 
In the context in which the lottery tickets are exclusively sold to New York residents and
each of them bought just one ticket, then the wide scope reading in (11a) is false, but
the narrow scope reading in (11b) is true. However, much as in (10a), the wide scope
reading materially implies the narrow scope reading, i.e., whenever the former is true,
so is the latter. The sentence in (11a) thus allows for the narrow scope reading of the
quantiﬁer below the modal.
We believe that the same holds of non-monotonic quantiﬁers like exactly n where n
is a natural number (we thank Tue Trinh for raising this point) and downward-entailing
quantiﬁers like at most n:

104
P. Law
(12) a. 
Exactly ten senators are likely to support the motion. 
b.
 It is likely that exactly ten senators support the motion. 
(13) a. 
At most ten senators are likely to support the motion. 
b.
 It is likely that at most ten senators support the motion. 
Here, too, the sentences in (12a) and (13a) allow for the narrow scope readings, for they
are materially implied by the wide scope readings.
By contrast, when the truth of the wide scope reading does not materially imply
that of the narrow scope reading, then the sentence does not allow for the narrow scope
reading. The sentences in (14a) and (15a) with non-monotonic or downward-entailing
quantiﬁers do not have the narrow scope readings in (14b) and (15b) respectively:
(14) a. 
Exactly ten senators are not likely to support the motion. 
b.
 It is not likely that exactly ten senators support the motion. 
(15) a. 
At most ten senators are not likely to support the motion. 
b.
 It is not likely that at most ten senators support the motion. 
The wide scope reading of sentence (14a) is true in a situation where exactly ten senators
are likely to support the motion, exactly ten others are not, and the rest are undecided.
But the narrow scope reading in (14b) is false in this situation. Hence, the sentence in
(14a) does not allow for the narrow scope reading.
Some speakers ﬁnd the wide and narrow scope readings of sentence (15a) with the
downward-entailing quantiﬁer at most ten a little difﬁcult to process, but the difﬁculty
can be removed by rephrasing them as in (16a) and (16b) respectively:
(16) a. 
The number of senators not likely to support the motion is at most ten. 
b.
It is not likely that the number of senators supporting the motion is at most  
 
 
ten. 
In a situation where forty senators are likely to support and ten are not likely to, the
sentence in (16a) is true, but that in (16b) is false. The sentence in (15a) thus does not
allow for the narrow reading of the quantiﬁer.

A-movement Scope Reconstruction
We consider here some examples of lack of A-movement scope reconstruction. We argue
that they can be explained by the account according to which only the highest copy of an
A-moved phrase is interpreted and by the idea that the narrow scope reading is possible
if the wide scope reading materially implies it.
[6] takes the lack of the narrow scope reading in (17a) to be evidence that
A-movement does not reconstruct (cf. Also [19]):

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
105
The argument is relatively straightforward. If the lower copy of the subject quantiﬁer
everyone is interpreted as in (17a), then the embedded clause is structurally the same as
that in (17b). It is then predicted, incorrectly, that the quantiﬁer may be in the scope of
negation. However, if the copy is not interpreted, then whatever explains how negation
may scope over the embedded subject will fail to apply, there being no interpreted copy
in the embedded clause.2 A-movement apparently does not reconstruct.
The sentence in (17a) has a reading in which the quantiﬁer is in the scope of the
modal seem, but has scope above negation. This reading is expected in our account. The
wide scope reading in (18a) where the universal quantiﬁer everyone takes scope above
seem and negation materially implies the narrow scope reading in (18b) in which it is
under the scope of seem but above negation:
The sentence in (17a) is correctly predicted to have this reading. However, the reading
in (18a) does not materially implies the reading in (18c) where the quantiﬁer takes scope
below both the modal seem and negation. This is hardly surprising, as the wide scope
reading of the universal quantiﬁer everyone over negation generally does not materially
imply the narrow scope reading below negation, for any predicate P:
The sentence in (17a) therefore does not have the reading in which negation takes scope
above the quantiﬁer.
[20] argues that the example in (20a), in a situation in which ﬁve fair coins are ﬂipped
in a fair way, cannot be accurately paraphrased as in (20b):
If the sentence in (20a) is derived as in (20c) but the copy of the A-moved universal
quantiﬁer is not interpreted, then it follows that the quantiﬁer is not in the scope of
the matrix predicate. It is expected in our analysis that the sentence in (20a) where the
2 [2] suggests that wide scope negation over a subject universal quantiﬁer in the same clause is
due to covert raising of negation. This operation may apply to (17b) with the subject quantiﬁer
is in the embedded clause, but not to (17a), for there is no interpreted copy of the raised subject
in the embedded clause.

106
P. Law
universal quantiﬁer has wide cope over the matrix predicate does not have the narrow
scope reading in (20b), since it does not materially imply it.
Consider now the contrast in (21) where the pronoun can only be understood to be
a bound variable if the universal quantiﬁer is A-moved to the matrix clause:
(21) a. 
Every professori seems to hisi students [ <every professori > to be smart ] 
b. *It seems to hisi students that [ that every professori is smart ] 
c.
seem-to-his-students( x professor(x)(x is smart) 
The binding in (21a) is straightforward, as the highest copy of the A-moved subject is
interpreted, thereby binding the pronoun that it c-commands. The lack of binding in
(21b) may be explained syntactically, the quantiﬁer not c-commanding the pronoun and
quantiﬁer scope being clause-bound. But our semantic account can account for it too.
The narrow scope reading of sentence (21a) is given in (21c). The pronoun is obvi-
ously not in the scope of the quantiﬁer, and thus cannot be bound by it. The wide scope
reading in (21a) with a bound pronoun therefore does not materially imply the narrow
scope reading with an unbound pronoun. It is thus correctly predicted that the sentence
does not have the narrow scope reading.
We now turn to A-movement reconstruction for binding condition C.
5
Late Merger and Scope Reconstruction
[21, 22] points out the binding contrast of the sort in (22) as evidence that adjuncts may
attach to a noun phrase after it undergoes A-bar-movement, an option that is not available
to complement PPs:
(22) a.
[ which pictures of John’s room ] does he like?
*i=j; i≠j
b.
[ which pictures in John’s room ] does he like?
i=j, i≠j
According to the copy theory of movement, the structures for the examples in (22a,b)
are as in (23a,b) respectively:
(23) a.
[ which pictures [ of John’s room ]] does he like <which pictures of John>?
b.
[ which pictures [ in John’s room ]] does he like <which pictures>?
Since the complement PP of John’s room in (23a) is part of the object before it moves,
the proper name John in the copy left behind by the wh-phrase is bound, in violation of
Binding Condition C. By contrast, the adjunct PP in John’s room is not part of the object
before it moves, but undergoes late merger, i.e., it is attached to it after movement, then
the copy it leaves behind does not have the proper name that is bound as in (23b). The
structure therefore does not violate Binding Condition C.
There is apparently no reason why late merger of adjuncts is not applicable to A-
moved phrase. According to [29], the adjunct PP with a hat in (24a) is outside the scope
of the modal likely:

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
107
(24) a. 
 Some man with a hat is likely to arrive. 
b. [ some man [ with a hat ]] is likely [ <some man> to arrive ] 
If the phrase some man is ﬁrst merged [6] in the embedded clause and is raised to the
matrix clause leaving behind a copy of itself as in (24b), and only then is the adjunct PP
merged into it, it then follows that the PP is not in the scope of likely, for it is not part
of the copy. In Ruys’ analysis, technical details aside, the subject with the PP cannot
reconstruct, since it is not identical to the copy.
The example in (25a), from [12], is another instance where late merger seems to block
reconstruction, which in their judgement only has the reading in which the quantiﬁer is
outside the scope of the intensional predicate look for:
(25) a. 
I looked for a picture very intensely by this artist. 
> look for; *look for >
b. I looked for [A a picture ] very intensely [B a picture ] [PP by this artist ] 
In [39], the indeﬁnite a picture is ﬁrst merged in its base-position and then moves to the
right of the adverb very intensely (by overt QR [12]) and the adjunct PP by this artist
is late-merged with a picture, as in (25b). The copy in A is realized at PF, and but the
copy in B is interpreted. The extraposed phrase cannot reconstruct to A since it is not
identical to it.
However, from the perspective of logical material implication, the sentence in (26a)
materially implies that in (26b), contrary to the judgement reported by Ruys:
(26) a. 
Some man with a hat is likely to arrive. 
(=(24a))  
 
b. 
It is likely that some man with a hat is likely to arrive. 
Similarly, the sentence in (27a) is like that in (25b) except that the copy a picture in A
is not realized at PF, but that in B is both realized at PF and interpreted:
(27) a.  
I looked for very intensely a picture by this artist. 
(=(25b))
 
b. 
I looked for one or other picture by this artist very intensely. 
As the sentence in (27a) materially implies that in (27b), the narrow scope reading of
the quantiﬁer in (25a) ought to be possible as well.
In fact, there are some conceptual and empirical problems with Ruys’ account for
(24a) and (25a). Conceptually, late merger of adjuncts is optional [29]. The adjunct PP
must undergo late merger in (22b) to circumvent a Binding Condition C violation. But
there is no such motivation in (24a) and (25a). It should then in principle be possible
for the adjunct PP in these cases to merge with the indeﬁnite in its base-position. The
subject undergoing raising in (26a) and the extraposed phrase in (27a) would leave
behind identical copies. It should be possible to interpret these copies giving rise to the
narrow scope readings.

108
P. Law
Empirically, the wide scope reading of the indeﬁnite in (27a) is logically equivalent
to the sentence in (28), which materially implies the sentence in (27b):
(28) There is a picture by this artist that I looked for very intensely. 
The sentence in (27a) therefore materially implies the sentence in (27b). There is then
no reason why it does not allow for the narrow scope reading of the indeﬁnite.
Moreover, additional evidence for an indeﬁnite structurally higher than an intensional
predicate to have scope over it comes from the example in (29a):
(29) a. 
I looked for many times a picture by this artist. 
b. I looked for a picture by this artist many times. 
In (29a), the frequency adverb many times semantically has scope over the intensional
predicate look for, i.e., many times of looking for; hence, it is structurally higher than
the predicate. The extraposed indeﬁnite a picture by this artist is structurally higher than
the adverb, and is thus higher than the predicate. Yet, semantically it may be in the scope
of both, just as it does when it is syntactically in its base-position in (29b). The sentence
in (29a) can mean that I looked for one or other picture by this artist, much like that
in (29b). The narrow scope reading of the indeﬁnite in (29a) is hardly surprising, for it
is materially implied by the wide scope reading. If it is true that there is a picture by
this artist that I looked for many times, then it is also true that I looked for one or other
picture by this artist many times.
The wide scope reading of the indeﬁnite in (25a) and (27a) recalls the de re/de dicto
readings of an indeﬁnite with respect to the intensional predicate. In fact, there is reason
to believe that the extraposed indeﬁnite in these cases may be in the scope of look for.
[2] credits the examples in (30) to Gennaro Chierchia:
(30) a. 
Even though there are no unicorns, yet a unicorn seems to be approaching. 
b. Even though unicorns are fictional entities, yet a unicorn seems to be  
 
 
approaching. 
These sentences are not self-contradicting, for the indeﬁnite a unicorn is understood to
be in the scope of the modal seem. They apparently show that an indeﬁnite syntactically
outside the scope of a modal may be read de dicto in the scope of the modal. If so, then
the indeﬁnite in (27a) and (29a), too, despite its being structurally outside the scope of
the modal, much like the indeﬁnite in (30), may have a de dicto reading in the scope of
the intensional predicate look for as well.

Binding and Interpretation of Formal Features
Certain facts about binding seem to present a problem for our conclusion that only the
highest copy of an A-moved phrase is interpreted.

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
109
For our immediate concerns here, we consider the basic cases in (31)–(32), familiar
from the study of binding [3, 4]:
(31) a.  John believed [ Maryi to have criticized herselfi ]
b.  *Johni believed [ Mary to have criticized himselfi ] 
(32) a.   *John believed [ Maryi to have criticized heri ]
b.  Johni believed [ Mary to have criticized himi ] 
Binding Condition A requires that an anaphor be bound in the embedded clause, whence
the contrast in (31). Binding Condition B requires that a pronoun be free in the embedded
clause, whence the contrast in (32).3
In this light, it comes as a surprise that in (33a) the anaphor may be bound by the
subject in the matrix clause:
(33) a. 
It seemed [ that Johni has criticized himselfi ] 
b. Johni seemed [ to have criticized himselfi ] 
(cf. (31b))
c. 
Johni seemed [ <Johni> to have criticized himselfi ] 
 
The subject in the matrix clause in (33b) behaves as if it is in the embedded clause, for
it may bind the anaphor. The binding can be accounted for, if the matrix subject leaves
a copy of itself in the embedded clause when it moves to the matrix clause, as in (33c).
If the lower copy is interpreted, then it can bind the anaphor. But this is impossible on
the view according to which only the highest copy of an A-moved phrase is interpreted.
The same problem arises in (34). The matrix subject in (34b), too, behaves as if it is
in the embedded clause, illicitly binding the pronoun violating Binding Condition B:
(34) a.   *It seemed [ that Johni has criticized himi ] 
b.   *Johni seemed [ to have criticized himi ] 
(cf. (32b))
c.   *Johni seemed [ <Johni> to have criticized himi ] 
Interpreting the lower copy if the A-moved subject explains why the pronoun is illicitly
bound in the embedded clause. Again, this is impossible if only the highest copy of an
A-moved phrase is interpreted.
Facts concerning binding by a quantiﬁer are essentially the same. The quantiﬁer
subject A-moved to the matrix clause may bind an anaphor and may not bind a pronoun
in the embedded clause:
3 For the deﬁnition of the local domain for binding, see [4]. The domains in which Binding
Conditions A and B are satisﬁed do not always coincide [14]. For example, both an anaphor
and a pronoun in a nominal phrase may be bound by an antecedent in the same clause.

110
P. Law
(35) a. 
Some mani seemed [ to have criticized himselfi ]  
b. Some mani seemed [ <some mani> to have criticized himselfi ] 
(36) a. *Some mani seemed [ to have criticized himi ]  
b. *Some mani seemed [ <some mani> to have criticized himi ] 
It looks as if we must interpret the copy in the embedded clause in order to account for
the binding facts.
The examples in (37a) and (38a) present an especially serious problem for our
conclusion in the last section that only the highest copy of an A-moved phrase is
interpreted:
(37) a. 
Some senatori is not likely to criticize himselfi
 
b. Some senatori is not likely [ <some senatori > criticizes himselfi ] 
(38) a.   *Some senatori is not likely to criticize himi
 
b.   *Some senatori is not likely [ <some senatori > criticizes himi ] 
On one hand, if the lower copy is not interpreted, then it becomes a mystery as to how
the anaphor in (37a) is bound and how the pronoun in (38a) is not free in the embedded
clause. On the other hand, if we interpret the lower copies to explain the binding facts,
then it would lead to incorrect interpretations of the scope of negation, as shown in the
last section.
To resolve this dilemma, we would like to suggest that formal features be divided into
lexical features (l-features) and morphosyntactic features (ms-features). As our interests
here concern binding and scope of quantiﬁers, we will limit ourselves to formal features
of nominals.
A nominal expression essentially has two kinds of formal features: l-features and
ms-features. The former comprises property-denoting features (student, teacher, picture
etc.) and semantic features distinguishing the, a, some, that, etc. The latter comprises
categorial, person, number and gender features. Thus, two nominals may differ with
respect to the l-features but are indistinguishable with respect to the ms-features, or they
may be the same with respect to l-features but differ from each other with respect to the
ms-features. Thus, in (39a) student and teacher differ with respect to l-features, but are
the same with respect to ms-features:
(39) a. 
student, teacher, picture, …
b. student, students; teacher, teachers; picture, pictures, …
In (39b), student and students differ with respect to ms-features, but are the same with
respect to l-features.
For binding principles, what is relevant are the ms-features, not the l-features. The
difference in l-features has no relevance to binding principles. Thus, binding is just the
same whether the antecedent is boy or male teacher or is girls, female teachers even
though members of each pair differ from each other with respect to the l-features:

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
111
b. {*That, those} {girlsi, female teachersi} criticized {*himselfi, *herselfi,
 
 
themselvesi} 
(41) a. *{Some, the} {boyi, male teacheri} criticized himi. 
b. *Those {girlsi, female teachersi} criticized themi. 
(40) a. 
{Some, the} {boyi, male teacheri} criticized {himselfi, *themselvesi,
 
 
*herselfi} 
Accordingly, the notion of binding in Binding Theory [3, 4] should be revised as in
(42):
(42) A binds B iff  
a. 
A c-commands B, and  
b. their person, number and gender ms-features have the same values. 
An expression is free if it is not bound. Binding has no requirement regarding l-features.
We propose a dynamic theory of interpretation according to which formal features
are interpreted according to their relevance to particular grammatical principles. As ms-
features are relevant to binding (see (42)) but l-features are not, the former but not the
latter are interpreted where Binding principles apply. L-features are generally interpreted
after all syntactic operations.
In cases without movement, the selective interpretation of formal features makes
little difference. Its signiﬁcance shows up in cases with movement:
(43) a. 
{Johni, some mani} seemed [ to have criticized himselfi ] 
b. {Johni, some mani} seemed [ {<Johni>/<some mani>} to have criticized  
 
 
himselfi ] 
(44) a.  *{Those, at most five} {girlsi, female teachersi} seemed [ to have criticized  
 
 
themi ] 
b.  *{Those, at most five} {girlsi, female teachersi} seemed [ {<those>/<at most  
 
 
five>} {<girlsi>/<female teachersi>} to have criticized themi ] 
The binding facts in these examples can be accounted for by interpreting the ms-features
in the copies left behind by the A-moved subject, since these features are relevant to
binding (see (42)).
Along these lines, we can resolve the requirements by Binding principles and lack of
A-movement reconstruction. In (45a) and (46a) the interpretations of the ms-features of
the copies left behind by the A-moved subject explain why the anaphor is bound and the
pronoun is free in the embedded clause; they have the same person, number and gender
ms-features as those of their antecedents:

(46) a.   *Some senatori is not likely to criticize himi
 
b.   *Some senatori is not likely [ <some senatori > to criticize himi ] 
As the l-features of the A-moved subject some senator are not relevant to binding, they
are not interpreted in the embedded clause. As a result, it does not fall in the scope
of negation, as desired. The l-features in the highest copy are interpreted, yielding the
readings in which the A-moved subject has scope above both negation and the matrix
predicate likely.
The examples in (47) and (48) [11] apparently suggest that A-movement may
reconstruct (the copies in angle-brackets are added for our purposes here):4
(47) a. 
A student of Davidi’s seems to himi [ <a student of Davidi’s> to be at the
 
 
party ]  
>seem; *seem>
b. A student of hisi seems to Davidi [ <a student of hisi> to be at the party ] 
 
>seem;   seem>
The lack of the narrow scope reading in (47a) can be accounted for if the copy in
the embedded clause the A-moved subject leaves behind is interpreted, in violation of
Binding Condition C. The example in (47b) is ﬁne, regardless of whether the copy in
the embedded clause is interpreted, as the pronoun is free in the DP containing it (see
note 3).
WewouldliketosuggestthatBindingConditionsbesatisﬁedatthepointofderivation
in which the domains relevant to them are constructed. For instance, for the example in
(33b), Binding Condition A is satisﬁed at the point where the embedded clause is built
as in (33c). Likewise, Binding Condition B in the example in (34b) is not satisﬁed at
the point when the embedded clause is built in (34c). The same process applies in the
structures in (35b), (36b), (37b) and (38b).
Differing from other Binding Conditions A and B, Binding Condition C requires
that a proper name be free, without regard to the locality of the antecedent. Along these
lines, Binding Condition C is violated in (47a) at the point in the derivation in which the
embedded clause is merged with the dative to him, before the embedded subject moves
the the matrix clause.
The contrast in (48) [11] too seems to indicate that A-movement may reconstruct
(the copies in angle-brackets are added for our purposes here):
(48) a. ??Someone from hisi class shouted to every professori [ PROi to be careful ] 
b. Someone from hisi class seems to every professori [ <someone from hisi
 
 
class> to be careful ] 
4 We treat proper names here as property-denoting, e.g., David denotes a set of properties that
David has. (cf. [17]). In some Romance languages, proper names co-occur with determiners
much like common nouns. English allows it to some limited extent, e.g., the David that I know.

Scope Reconstruction and Interpretation of Copies
113
The bound reading of the pronoun in (48b) can be accounted for by interpreting the
copy the A-moved subject leaves behind in the embedded clause. The lack of the bound
variable reading of the pronoun in the example in (48a) with a matrix control verb is
precisely because there is no copy in the embedded clause. It is not possible to derive to
the bound reading in (48b) by QR of the quantiﬁer, for that would incur the same Weak
Crossover [24] violation as that in (48a) [18, 25, 28].
We would like to suggest that as variable binding, like Binding Condition C, bears
on the interpretation of ms-features and is not subject to locality, apart from structural
c-command, a pronominal variable can be bound by an antecedent c-commanding it at
any point in the derivation. Along these lines, the pronoun in the embedded subject can
be bound by the universal quantiﬁer at the point where the embedded clause is merged
with the dative to every professor in the matrix clause. The binding relationship can be
formally indicated by the familiar coindexing. It is this binding relationship that allows
the pronoun to be bound as a variable by the universal quantiﬁer.
We note here that the matrix subject with the bound variable reading of the pronoun
in (47b) appears to take scope above seem. This reading cannot be explained if the lower
copy of the A-moved subject is interpreted, for the subject would necessarily be in the
scope of seem.

Conclusions
In our investigation of A-movement of quantiﬁers undertaken here, we show that syntac-
tic scope reconstruction, via the copy theory of movement, may lead to some incorrect
results.
We claim that relative scope of quantiﬁers, modals and negation is derived from
the logical relations among them, speciﬁcally, from the logical material implications.
As logical relations are independent of A-movement, our analysis relying on these and
requiring no additional assumptions can be said to bear no theoretical cost speciﬁc to
A-movement.
We argue that the same logical relations lead us to the consequence that late merger of
adjuncts has no effect on quantiﬁer scope in extraposition. We show that a quantiﬁer with
a late-merged adjunct structurally higher than an intensional predicate may nevertheless
have scope below it. If our account is correct, then scope interpretation is essentially
semantic.
Our suggestion that formal features be interpreted according to their relevance to
the grammatical principles at the point they apply resolves some conﬂicting demands by
binding and scope. Formal features are not interpreted all at the same time as is commonly
taken for granted, but may be selectively interpreted. On one hand, ms-features bearing
on syntactic principles are interpreted derivationally, i.e., as the syntactic structures
are derived by successive merge [6]. The features are interpreted when the structural
constraints they are subject to become relevant, possibly phase-wise [7, 8], to reduce the
amount of checking. On the other hand, l-features in the highest copy of an A-moved
phrase are interpreted when all movement has taken place, for it may cross scope-bearing
expressions.
Our analysis thus enlarges the body of evidence showing lack of reconstruction in
A-movement.

Abstract. The language of propositional modal logic has been shown highly
useful in developing logics of various speciﬁc speech acts. But it is also clear that
we need more expressive language if we wish to say, for example, that, for any
x and y, whenever x promises y to see to it that y is safe, it becomes obligatory
for x to see to it that y is safe with respect to y in the name of x. We develop a
dynamic modal predicate logic, DCTSDAL= (Dynamiﬁed Commonsense Term-
Sequence-Deontic-Alethic Logic with equality), in which we can assert exactly
the kind of things like this by extending a version of term-sequence-modal logic
introduced in [7] with dynamic modalities that stand for acts of commanding and
promising. We develop a semantics which incorporates the commonsense treat-
ment of free variables introduced in [1] and combine it with the varying domain
assumption as is done in [9]. The main contribution of this paper is the rela-
tive semantic completeness of DCTSDAL= with respect to its static base logic
CTSDAL= via recursion axioms.

Introduction
The language of propositional modal logic has been shown highly useful in developing
logics of various speciﬁc speech acts. But it is also clear that we need more expressive
language if we wish to say, for example, that if you promise a person to keep her safe,
you are committed to keep her safe. Its natural formalization might be something like
the following:
∀x. ∀y. [Prom(x,y)Safe(y)]O(x,y,x)Safe(y)
where [Prom(x,y)ψ]ϕ means that whenever x promises y that x will see to it that ψ, ϕ
holds in the resulting situation and O(x,y,z)ϕ means that it is obligatory for x (the agent
who owes the obligation) with respect to y (the agent to whom the obligation is owed)
in the name of z (the agent who creates the obligation) to see to it that ϕ. In this paper,
we will develop a logic in which we can assert exactly the kind of things like this.

Dynamiﬁed Common Sense Term-Sequence-Deontic-Alethic Logic

The reader may wonder why we need to have three indices for our deontic opera-
tor O(x,y,z) above. This is because we analyze not only acts of promising but also acts
of commanding. For example, if you command a person to keep herself safe, she is
obligated to keep herself safe. Similarly as above, this may be naturally formalized as
follows:
∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)Safe(y)]O(y,x,x)Safe(y),
where [Com(x,y)ψ]ϕ means that whenever x commands y to see to it that ψ, ϕ holds in
the resulting situation. In the case of an act of commanding, the agent who creates the
obligation is the commander and is identical with the agent to whom the obligation is
owed (sometimes called “obligee”), while the agent who owes the obligation (some-
times called “obligor” ) is the commandee. In the case of an act of promising, however,
the agent who creates the obligation is the agent who makes the promise (the promiser)
and is identical with the agent who owes the obligation while the agent to whom the
obligation is owed is the agent to whom the promise is given (the promisee). If we only
includes the roles of the creator of the obligation and the agent who owes the obligation,
the role of the agent to whom the promise is given would be ignored, which does not
seem right.
These two speech acts were already studied in [13] in the propositional setting, but
this previous study cannot explicitly capture an dependency of y in Safe(y) on, say, the
act [Com(x,y)Safe(y)] of commanding or the deontic operator O(y,x,x) as it does not have
the distinction between terms and predicates. Note that all occurrences of the varibles
x and y in the formula [Com(x,y)Safe(y)]O(y,x,x)Safe(y), including the occurrences of x
and y as the indices of Com(x,y) and O(y,x,x), are bound by the universal quantiﬁers ∀x.
and ∀y. in the formula ∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)Safe(y)]O(y,x,x)Safe(y) respectively.
In formalizing the above examples, we also incorporate the intuitive idea of the
contingency of existence of agents like us. I do exist in the actual world, say w, but I
am not a necessary being and so there is a possible world v such that v is accessible
from w but I do not exist in v. I actually do not have a sister, but it is not necessary
that I do not have a sister; there is a possible world u such that u is accessible from
w and someone who does not exist in w is my sister in u. One straightforward way of
representing such contingency of existence of individual entities is to assume that the
domains of possible worlds vary in any ways unless they are not empty. We refer to this
assumption as varying domain assumption (VDA, for short).
We introduce quantiﬁcation by recasting the dynamic logic of acts of command-
ing and promising developed in [13] in a dynamic extension of the language of Term-
sequence-modal Logics (TSMLs) developed in [7].1 TSMLs are generalizations of
Term-Modal Logics (TMLs) developed by [4,10] in the sense that TMLs are instances
of TSML. 2 For, in TMLs, modalities are allowed to be indexed by a term; for example,
the statement that every Christian believes in the existence of God can be expressed by
1 The second author has developed a PAL-style dynamic logic that characterizes eﬀects of acts
of requesting and asserting along with those of acts of commanding and promising in [15] in
the propositional setting, but in order to keep things simple, we will ignore acts of requesting
and asserting in this paper. This enables us to concentrate on alethic and deontic readings of
term-sequence-modal operators.
2 Modal predicate logics are also instances of TSML.

the following formulas [4, p. 134]):
∀x. (Christian(x) →[x]∃y. God(y)),
where [x]ϕ is read as “x believes that ϕ”. TSMLs extend TMLs by allowing modal
operators to be indexed by a ﬁnite sequence of terms. Thus, the moral judgement that
parents are obligated to keep their young children safe can be expressed by the follow-
ing:
∀x. ∀y. ((Parent(x, y) ∧Young(y)) →O(x,y,x)Safe(y)).
And ﬁnally, by deﬁning model updating operations, we may introduce dynamic opera-
tors standing for types of acts of commanding and promising. Then it becomes possible
to express, for example, the judgement that if you promise a person to keep her safe, you
are committed to keep her safe by the following formula mentioned at the beginning of
this paper:
∀x. ∀y. [Prom(x,y)Safe(y)]O(x,y,x)Safe(y).
Another policy we will incorporate in the logic to be developed in this paper is that
of common sense treatment of free variables (CTFV, for short), proposed in [1] and
further developed in [9]. It requires free variables in the formula to be interpreted by
objects existing in the local domain at the current world (see [1, p.121]).
One consequence of the combination of CTFV and VDA is that K-axiom □(ϕ →
ψ) →(□ϕ →□ψ) is not valid. But, if FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ) holds then K-axiom above is valid,
where FV(ϕ) is the set of free variables occurring in ϕ. As a result, we need to take care
of free variables when we apply replacement of equivalent formulas. That is, when ϕ
and ψ are equivalent and FV(ϕ) = FV(ψ), a formula χ and a resulting formula replacing
some occurrences of ϕ in χ with ψ are equivalent. When we turn our eyes on dynamic
epistemic logic, replacement of equivalent formulas plays an important role in applying
the (inside-out) recursion strategy of reducing the semantic completeness of, say, public
announcement logic to the semantic completeness of the underlying epistemic logic
(cf. [12]). In this sense, it is a non-trivial question if we can apply a recursion strategy
also in our setting. We answer this question positively.
The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the syntax which has deon-
tic and alethic modal operators as well as the equality symbol. Note that the equality
symbol is needed in order to state recursion axioms for its dynamic extension.3 Then
we move on to the semantics which incorporates VDA and CTFV. We also provide
our Hilbert system H(CTSDAL=), which is sound for our semantics (Theorem 1). In
Sect. 3, we show how CTSDAL= can be extended into a dynamic logic, DCTSDAL=,
by introducing dynamic modalities that stand for types of acts of commanding and
promising. We also specify which acts of commanding and promising generate obliga-
tions. In particular, when the content of acts of commanding and promising is written
in terms of a ﬁrst-order formula, they always generate obligations (Theorem 2). This
is a similar result to that for the notion of successful formulas in the public announce-
ment logic (cf. [6,11]). In Sect. 4, we establish that DCTSDAL= is sound (Theorem
3) and semantically complete relatively to CTSDAL= in the sense that DCTSDAL= is
semantically complete if CTSDAL= is semantically complete (Theorem 4). Section 5
concludes the paper.
3 Recursion axioms are also known as “reduction axioms” in literature.

Syntax, Semantics and Hilbert System of CTSDAL=
The syntax L for CTSDAL= consists of the following vocabulary: (i) a countably inﬁ-
nite set Var = {x, y, . . . } of variables, (ii) a countably inﬁnite set Pred = {P, Q, . . . }
of predicate symbols, each of which has a ﬁxed ﬁnite arity, and (iii) the equality sym-
bol =, (iv) a set of logical symbols whose members are ¬, →, ∀, □and O(x,y,z) where
x, y, z ∈Var. Then, the set FormL of all formulas are inductively deﬁned as follows:
FormL ∋ϕ:: = P(x1, . . . , xn) | x = y | ¬ϕ | (ϕ →ϕ) | ∀x. ϕ | □ϕ | O(x,y,z)ϕ,
where P ∈Pred and all of x1, . . ., xn, x, y, z are variables in Var. We read □ϕ as “it is
necessary that ϕ” and O(x,y,z)ϕ as “it is obligatory for x with respect to y in the name
of z to see to it that ϕ.” We deﬁne other Boolean connectives such as conjunction ∧,
disjunction ∨and logical equivalence ↔as usual and we abbreviate ¬(x = y) as x  y.
We also use the deﬁned dual P(x,y,z)ϕ := ¬O(x,y,z)¬ϕ, which is read as “x is permitted
with respect to y in the name of z to see to it that ϕ”. Let us also introduce the following
abbreviation, which is useful to state recursion axioms later: Given a ﬁnite set X =
{x1, . . . , xn} of variables, we deﬁne
⊤X := P(x1, . . . , xn) →P(x1, . . . , xn)
Thus, ⊤X is a tautology written in terms of all variables in X.4 We deﬁne the complexity
c(ϕ) of a formula ϕ as the total number of occurrences of logical connectives in ϕ.
Deﬁnition 1. Given a formula ϕ, we deﬁne the set FV(ϕ) of all free variables in ϕ
inductively as follows:
FV(P(x1, . . . , xn)) := {x1, . . . , xn},
FV(x = y) := {x, y},
FV(¬ϕ) := FV(ϕ),
FV(ϕ →ψ) := FV(ϕ) ∪FV(ψ),
FV(∀x. ϕ) := FV(ϕ) \ {x},
FV(□ϕ) := FV(ϕ),
FV(O(x,y,z)ϕ) := {x, y, z} ∪FV(ϕ).
We use ϕ[y/x] as the result of substituting all free occurrences of x in ϕ uniformly with
y, where we avoid the variable clash and rename the bound variable to a fresh variable.
We move on to our semantics. A model M is a tuple
M := (W, D, R□, RO, V)
where W is a non-empty set of possible worlds; D is a family (D(w))w∈W of non-
empty set of objects; R□is a binary relation on W; RO is a family of binary rela-
tions RO(d1, d2, d2) ⊆W × W indexed by (d1, d2, d3) ∈
w∈WD(w)3 such that
RO(d1, d2, d3) ⊆R□; V assigns each predicate symbol P with V(P, w) ⊆D(w)n where
the arity of P is n.
As in the following deﬁnition, our variable assignment is rigid, i.e., it does not
depend on a given world.
4 We may also deﬁne ⊤X := (x1 = x1) ∧· · · ∧(xn = xn).

120
K. Sano and T. Yamada
Deﬁnition 2. Let M = (W, D, R□, RO, V) be a model. A variable assignment is a function
α : Var →
w∈W D(w). We deﬁne α(x|d) as the same variable assignment as α except
sending x to d ∈
w∈W D(w). Given a variable assignment α, a formula ϕ is said to be
an αw-formula if, for all x ∈FV(ϕ), α(x) ∈D(w) holds, i.e., α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(w), where
α[Y] is the direct image of Y ⊆Var under the function α.
Deﬁnition 3. Let M = (W, D, R□, RO, V) be a model and α a variable assignment. We
deﬁne the satisfaction relation M, α, w |= ϕ between M, α, w and αw-formula ϕ induc-
tively as follows:
M, α, w |= P(x1, . . . , xn) iﬀ(α(x1), . . . , α(xn)) ∈V(P, w),
M, α, w |= x = y iﬀα(x) = α(y),
M, α, w |= ¬ϕ iﬀM, α, w ̸|= ϕ,
M, α, w |= ϕ →ψ iﬀM, α, w |= ϕ implies M, α, w |= ψ,
M, α, w |= ∀x. ϕ iﬀfor all d ∈D(w), M, α(x|d), w |= ϕ,
M, α, w |= □ϕ iﬀfor all v ∈W((w, v) ∈R□and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v)
imply M, α, v |= ϕ),
M, α, w |= O(x,y,z)ϕ iﬀfor all v ∈W((w, v) ∈RO(α(x), α(y), α(z)) and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v)
imply M, α, v |= ϕ).
We say that ϕ is valid if, for all models M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), worlds w ∈W and
variable assignments α such that α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(w), M, α, w |= ϕ holds.
It is noted that O(x,y,z)ϕ is an αw-formula in the satisfaction clause for O(x,y,z)ϕ and so all
of α(x), α(y) and α(z) are elements of D(w). For a formula of the form P(x,y,z)ϕ, we can
obtain the following satisfaction clause:
M, α, w |= P(x,y,z)ϕ iﬀfor some v ∈W((w, v) ∈RO(α(x), α(y), α(z)) and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v)
and M, α, v |= ϕ).
Seligman [9] observed that the Barcan formula ∀x. □ϕ →□∀x. ϕ is not valid but
the converse Barcan formula □∀x. ϕ →∀x. □ϕ is valid. While K-axiom □(ϕ →ψ) →
(□ϕ →□ψ) is not valid, it is valid if FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ) holds. It is noted that ϕ →ψ
is called an involvement when FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ) holds. So, if ϕ →ψ is an involvement,
K-axiom is valid.
Proposition 1. 1. □∀x. ϕ →∀x. □ϕ is valid.
2. If FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ), then □(ϕ →ψ) →(□ϕ →□ψ) is valid.
3. If ϕ is valid, then □ϕ is valid.
4. If FV(ϕ) = FV(ψ) and ϕ ↔ψ is valid, then □ϕ ↔□ψ is valid.
5. □ϕ →O(x,y,z)ϕ is valid.
6. When u  { x, y, z }, O(x,y,z)∀u. ϕ →∀u. O(x,y,z)ϕ is valid.
7. If FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ), O(x,y,z)(ϕ →ψ) →(O(x,y,z)ϕ →O(x,y,z)ψ) is valid.
8. If ϕ is valid, then O(x,y,x)ϕ is valid.
9. If FV(ϕ) = FV(ψ) and ϕ ↔ψ is valid, then O(x,y,z)ϕ ↔O(x,y,z)ψ is valid.

For Item 6, let u  { x, y, z } and ﬁx any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any vari-
able assignment α and any world w ∈W such that O(x,y,z)∀u. ϕ →∀u. O(x,y,z)ϕ is an
αw-formula. We assume u ∈FV(ϕ) below (otherwise, ∀u. is a “dummy” or vacuous
quantiﬁer and so it is easily seen to be valid). Suppose that M, α, w |= O(x,y,z)∀u. ϕ. To
show M, α, w |= ∀u. O(x,y,z)ϕ, let us ﬁx any d ∈D(w). We show M, α(u|d), w |= O(x,y,z)ϕ.
Let us also ﬁx any v ∈W such that (w, v) ∈RO(α(u|d)(x), α(u|d)(y), α(u|d)(z)) and
α(u|d)[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v). We establish M, α(u|d), v |= ϕ. By u  { x, y, z },
RO(α(u|d)(x), α(u|d)(y), α(u|d)(z)) = RO(α(x), α(y), α(z)).
By FV(∀u. ϕ) = FV(ϕ)\{ u }, it follows from α(u|d)[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v) that α[FV(∀u. ϕ)] ⊆
D(v). So, by our supposition of M, α, w |= O(x,y,z)∀u. ϕ, we have M, α, v |= ∀u. ϕ. By
u ∈FV(ϕ) and α(u|d)[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v), we get d ∈D(v). It follows that M, α(u|d), v |= ϕ,
as required.
For Item 7, suppose that FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ) and ﬁx any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V),
any variable assignment α and any world w ∈W such that O(x,y,z)(ϕ →ψ) →
(O(x,y,z)ϕ →O(x,y,z)ψ) is an αw-formula. Suppose that M, α, w |= O(x,y,z)(ϕ →ψ)
and M, α, w |= O(x,y,z)ϕ. To show that M, α, w |= O(x,y,z)ψ, ﬁx any world v ∈W
such that (w, v) ∈RO(α(x), α(y), α(z)) and α[FV(ψ)] ⊆D(v). Our goal is to establish
M, α, v |= ψ. It follows from FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ) that α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆α[FV(ψ)] ⊆D(v) and
α[FV(ϕ →ψ)] ⊆D(v). By the supposition, we obtain M, α, v |= ϕ →ψ and M, α, v |= ϕ.
Therefore, we conclude that M, α, v |= ψ.

Table 1 provides all the axioms and inference rules of Hilbert system H(CTSDAL=).
Based on the axiomatization of the ﬁrst-order logic with equality, we add all axioms
and inference rules for common sense modal predicate logic by Seligman [9] and two
additional axioms for O(x,y,z). As regards the axiom (Repl=), note that we allow ϕ to be
possibly non-atomic formulas. We deﬁne the notion of theorem as usual and use ⊢ϕ to
mean that ϕ is a theorem of H(CTSDAL=).

Proposition 2. The following hold in H(CTSDAL=):
(RE□) If ⊢ϕ ↔ψ and FV(ϕ) = FV(ψ), then ⊢□ϕ ↔□ψ.
(NecO) If ⊢ϕ, then ⊢O(x,y,z)ϕ.
(REO) If ⊢ϕ ↔ψ and FV(ϕ) = FV(ψ), then ⊢O(x,y,z)ϕ ↔O(x,y,z)ψ.
(CREO) If ⊢ϕ →(ψ1 ↔ψ2) and FV(ϕ) ⊆FV(ψ1) = FV(ψ2),
then ⊢O(x,y,z)ϕ →(O(x,y,z)ψ1 ↔O(x,y,z)ψ2).
(□=) ⊢x = y →□(x = y).
(O =) ⊢x = y →O(x1,x2,x3)(x = y).
(O ) ⊢x  y →O(x1,x2,x3)(x  y).
Proof. (RE□) holds by (Nec□) and (Kinv□). (NecO) holds by (Nec□) and (Mix). We
get both (REO) and (CREO) from (NecO) and (KinvO). (O ) is obtained from (Mix) and
(□). Since (O =) is obtained from (Mix) and (□=), we focus on (□=) below. For
(□=), we proceed as follows. By (Ref=) and (Nec□), we get ⊢□(x = x). By (Repl=),
we have ⊢x = y →(□(x = x) ↔□(x = y)). By propositional reasoning, we get from
⊢□(x = x) that ⊢x = y →□(x = y), as required.
⊓⊔
Remark 1. Note that the following analogue of the so-called Axiom (D) of standard
deontic logic is not included in the proof system deﬁned above:
O(x,y,z)ϕ →P(x,y,z)ϕ.
Axiom (D) has the eﬀect of precluding the possibility of deontic explosion (an absurd
situation in which everything comes to be obligatory) by precluding the possibility of
conﬂict of obligations in standard deontic logic (SDL, for short). As H(CTSDAL=) will
be dynamically extended into a dynamic logic of acts of commanding and promising in
the next section, however, we need to keep open the possibility of conﬂicts of obliga-
tions being generated by acts of commanding and/or promising. This, of course, leaves
the possibility of deontic explosion, but it will be shown to be minimized in the dynamic
logic to be developed. In the next section, we will show how conﬂicts of obligations is
generated and how the situation is represented without triggering deontic explosion in
real life examples (see Example 1).
Apart from the exclusion of Axiom (D) and the inclusion of Axiom (Mix), which
implies that if something is permitted then it is possible, H(CTSDAL=) can be said to
be similar to SDL in that it includes a weaker version (KinvO) of Axiom (K) for deontic
operators and the necessitation rule (NecO) can be derived from (Nec□) and (Mix) as in
Proposition 2.
Theorem 1. H(CTSDAL=) is sound for the semantics, i.e., if a formula is a theorem in
it, then it is valid.
Proof. It suﬃces to check that all the axioms are valid and all inference rules preserve
validity. We only focus on the non-ﬁrst order axioms and inference rules. By Proposition
1, it suﬃces to show the validity of (□). Fix any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any
variable assignment α and any world w ∈W such that x  y →□(x  y) is an αw-
formula. Suppose that M, α, w |= x  y, i.e., α(x)  α(y). Fix any world v ∈W such
that (w, v) ∈R□and α[{ x, y }] ⊆D(v). So, x  y is an αv-formula. By α(x)  α(y), we
conclude M, α, v |= x  y, as desired.

Remark 2. Semantic completeness of the fragment of H(CTSDAL=) without deontic
operators and equality was already established in [8] by constructing a canonical model.
Moreover, Yamada [16] employed an argument in [8] to establish semantic complete-
ness of the fragment of H(CTSDAL=) without equality. But, it is still an open question
if H(CTSDAL=) is semantically complete, i.e., every valid formula ϕ is a theorem of
H(CTSDAL=).

Dynamiﬁcation: Acts of Commanding and Promising
We extend our previous syntax L with dynamic operators of the form [Com(x,y)·] and
[Prom(x,y)·] for acts of commanding and promising and denote this new syntax by L+.
Then, the set FormL+ of all formulas in L+ is inductively deﬁned as follows:
FormL+ ∋ϕ :: = P(x1, . . . , xn) | x = y | ¬ϕ | (ϕ →ϕ) | ∀x. ϕ | □ϕ | O(x,y,z)ϕ | [π]ϕ,
π :: = Com(x,y)ϕ | Prom(x,y)ϕ.
So, we can construct formulas such as [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ and [Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ. We also deﬁne
the complexity c(ϕ) of a formula ϕ ∈FormL+ as the total number of occurrences of
logical connectives and dynamic operators in ϕ, e.g., c([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) = c(ϕ) + c(ψ)
+1. For a formula ϕ ∈FormL+, we also use FV(ϕ) to mean the set of all free variables
in ϕ by adding the following clauses to Deﬁnition 1:
FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) := { x, y } ∪FV(ϕ) ∪FV(ψ),
FV([Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ) := { x, y } ∪FV(ϕ) ∪FV(ψ).
We read [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ as “whenever an agent x commands an agent y to see to it that
ϕ, ψ holds in the resulting situation”. On the other hand, we read [Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ as
“whenever an agent x promises an agent y that x will see to it that ϕ, ψ holds in the
resulting situation”. Semantically, the act [Com(x,y)ϕ] of commanding restricts the range
of the deontic accessibility relation for the triple (y, x, x) to ϕ-states. Similarly, the act
[Prom(x,y)ϕ] of promising restricts the range of the deontic accessibility relation for the
triple (x, y, x) to ϕ-states. These ideas are implemented as in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4. Let M = (W, D, R□, RO, V) be a model and α be a variable assignment.
We extend the satisfaction relation M, α, w |= ϕ of Deﬁnition 3 between M, α, w and
αw-formula ϕ by the following new clause:
M, α, w |= [π]ψ iﬀMπ
α, α, w |= ψ,
where Mπ
α = (W, D, R□, Rπ
O, V) and Rπ
O ⊆W × W is deﬁned as follows.
– Let π := Com(x,y)ϕ. If (d1, d2, d3) = (α(y), α(x), α(x)) then we deﬁne:
(w, v) ∈Rπ
O(d1, d2, d3) iﬀ(w, v) ∈RO(d1, d2, d3) and M, α, v |= ϕ.
Otherwise, Rπ
O(d1, d2, d3) := RO(d1, d2, d3).

Otherwise, Rπ
O(d1, d2, d3) := RO(d1, d2, d3).
We deﬁne the notion of validity as in Deﬁnition 3.
Proposition 3. 1. All the formulas in Table 2 are valid.
2. All the formulas in Table 3 are valid.
Proof. We only establish Item 1 because Item 2 is proved similarly. For Item 1, we
show the validity of (CPr), (C∀) and (CO).
First, we deal with (CPr). Fix any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any variable assign-
ment α, and any world w ∈W such that every free variable x in (CPr) satisﬁes
α(x) ∈D(w). We proceed as follows:
M, α, w |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn) iﬀM
Com(x,y)ϕ
α
, α, w |= P(x1, . . . , xn),
iﬀ(α(x1), . . . , α(xn)) ∈V(P, w),
iﬀM, α, w |= P(x1, . . . , xn),
iﬀM, α, w |= ⊤{x,y}∪FV(ϕ) →P(x1, . . . , xn),
where we note that α[{x, y} ∪FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(w) hence M, α, w |= ⊤{x,y}∪FV(ϕ).
Second, we deal with (C∀). Fix any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any variable
assignment α, and any world w ∈W such that every free variable x in (C∀) satisﬁes

Dynamiﬁed Common Sense Term-Sequence-Deontic-Alethic Logic

α(x) ∈D(w). We proceed as follows:
M, α, w |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]∀z. ψ iﬀM
Com(x,y)ϕ
α

Com(x,y)ϕ

where we note that u  { x, y } ∪FV(ψ) and so M
Com(x,y)ϕ
α(u|d)
= M
Com(x,y)ϕ
α
by deﬁnition.
Finally, we deal with (CO). Fix any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any variable
assignment α, and any world w ∈W such that every free variables x in (CO) satisﬁes
α(x) ∈D(w). We proceed as follows:
M, α, w |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(x1,x2,x3)ψ
iﬀM
Com(x,y)ϕ
α
, α, w |= O(x1,x2,x3)ψ,
iﬀFor all v, if (w, v) ∈Rπ
O(α(x1), α(x2), α(x3)) and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v), then M
Com(x,y)ϕ
α
, α, v |= ψ,
iﬀFor all v, if (w, v) ∈Rπ
O(α(x1), α(x2), α(x3)) and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v), then M, α, v |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ.
where π := Com(x,y)ϕ. By the deﬁnition of Rπ
O when π := Com(x,y)ϕ, the last line is
equivalent to the conjunction of the following two statements:
– If (α(x1), α(x2), α(x3)) = (α(y), α(x), α(x)), then, for all worlds v ∈W,
if (w, v) ∈RO(α(x1), α(x2), α(x3)) and M, α, v |= ϕ and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v), then
M, α, v |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ.
– Otherwise, for all worlds v ∈W,
if (w, v) ∈RO(α(x1), α(x2), α(x3)) and α[FV(ϕ)] ⊆D(v), then M, α, v |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ.
The conjunction of these two statements is equivalent to the conjunction of the follow-
ing:
– If M, α, w |= (x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x), then
M, α, w |= O(x1,x2,x3)(ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ).
– If M, α, w |= ¬((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x)), then
M, α, w |= O(x1,x2,x3)[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ.
This conjunction is easily seen to be equivalent to the right hand side of the axiom (CO)
of Table 2.
⊓⊔
Proposition 4. The following inference rules preserve validity:
(NecC) From ψ, we may infer [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ;
(NecP) From ψ, we may infer [Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ.

126
K. Sano and T. Yamada
Proof. As for (NecP), we proceed as follows. Assume that ψ is valid. To show that
[Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ is valid, let us ﬁx any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any variable assign-
ment α and any world w ∈W such that [Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ is an αw-formula. Our goal is to
show that M
Prom(x,y)ϕ
α
, α, w |= ψ. Since ψ is valid and ψ is also an αw-formula, we obtain
M
Prom(x,y)ϕ
α
, α, w |= ψ, as desired. We can also similarly establish that (NecC) preserves
validity.
⊓⊔
Remark 3. It can be seen from the validity of (C →) and (P →) from Proposition 3 and
(NecC) and (NecP) from Proposition 4 that both [Com(x,y)ϕ] and [Prom(x,y)ϕ] can be
regarded as normal modal operators.
In what follows, we use the term CGO and PGO Principles to denote formulas of the
form ∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(y,x,x)ϕ and ∀x. ∀y. [Prom(x,y)ϕ]O(x,y,x)ϕ, respectively, where
“CGO” and “PGO” abbreviate “act of commanding generates obligation” and “act of
promising generates obligation”, respectively. We remark that the notion of CGO and
PGO Principles are similar to the notion of successful formulas in the public announce-
ment logic (cf. [11, Deﬁnition 4.31] and see also [6]).
Deﬁnition 5. We say that CGO (or PGO) Principle holds for Γ ⊆FormL+ if, for every
ϕ ∈Γ, ∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(y,x,x)ϕ (or ∀x. ∀y. [Prom(x,y)ϕ]O(x,y,x)ϕ, respectively) is
valid.
We are going to specify at least two classes of formulas from FormL for which CGO
and PGO Principles hold.
Lemma 1. 1. If ϕ ∈FormL is a ﬁrst-order formula (i.e., it does not contain □and
O(x1,x2,x3)), then ϕ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]ϕ and ϕ ↔[Prom(x,y)ψ]ϕ are valid.
2. If ϕ ∈FormL does not contain any deontic operator and {x, y} ∪FV(ψ) ⊆FV(ϕ),
then ϕ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]ϕ and ϕ ↔[Prom(x,y)ψ]ϕ are valid.
Proof. We only show Item 2 alone because an argument for Item 1 can be obtained by
omitting the assumption {x, y} ∪FV(ψ) ⊆FV(ϕ). For Item 2, we only prove the validity
of ϕ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]ϕ. We argue by induction on c(ϕ) such that ϕ ∈FormL does not
contain any deontic operator and {x, y} ∪FV(ψ) ⊆FV(ϕ). We only present the cases
where ϕ is of the form P(x1, . . . , xn), ∀z. χ or □χ.
Let ϕ be P(x1, . . . , xn) such that {x, y} ∪FV(ψ) ⊆{ x1, . . . , xn }. We prove that
P(x1, . . . , xn) ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]P(x1, . . . , xn) is valid. By Proposition 3, the axiom (CPr)
(⊤{ x,y }∪FV(ψ) →P(x1, . . . , xn)) ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]P(x1, . . . , xn) is valid. Since ⊤{ x,y }∪FV(ψ) is
valid, our goal follows immediately.
Let ϕ be ∀z. χ such that ∀z. χ does not contain any deontic operator and {x, y} ∪
FV(ψ) ⊆FV(∀z. χ) = FV(χ)\{ z }. We prove that ∀z. χ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]∀z. χ is valid. By
Proposition 3, the axiom (C∀) ∀u. ([Com(x,y)ψ](χ[u/z])) ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]∀z. χ is valid,
where u is a fresh variable. Since u is fresh, we have {x, y} ∪FV(ψ) ⊆FV(χ[u/z]). By
induction hypothesis, we have the validity of χ[u/z] ↔[Com(x,y)ψ](χ[u/z]). By the
ﬁrst-order reasoning, we obtain the validity of ∀z. χ ↔∀u. [Com(x,y)ψ](χ[u/z]). By
the validity of (C∀) above, we conclude the desired validity of the equivalence ∀z. χ ↔
[Com(x,y)ψ]∀z. χ.

Dynamiﬁed Common Sense Term-Sequence-Deontic-Alethic Logic
127
Let ϕ be □χ such that □χ does not contain any deontic operator and {x, y}∪FV(ψ) ⊆
FV(□χ) = FV(χ). We prove that □χ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]□χ is valid. By induction hypothesis,
χ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]χ is valid. By our assumption of {x, y} ∪FV(ψ) ⊆FV(χ), we get FV(χ)
= FV([Com(x,y)ψ]χ). It follows from Proposition 2 that □χ ↔□[Com(x,y)ψ]χ is valid.
By Proposition 3, the validity of (C□) implies our desired goal, i.e., the validity of
□χ ↔[Com(x,y)ψ]□χ.
⊓⊔
Theorem 2. Let ϕ ∈FormL. If (i) ϕ is a ﬁrst-order formula or (ii) ϕ does not contain
any deontic operator and ϕ satisﬁes { x, y } ⊆FV(ϕ), then ∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(y,x,x)ϕ
and ∀x. ∀y. [Prom(x,y)ϕ]O(x,y,x)ϕ are valid.
Proof. We only establish that the assumption (ii) implies our desired goal, because
almost the same argument can be applied for (i). Assume that ϕ ∈FormL does not con-
tain any deontic operator and suppose that { x, y } ⊆FV(ϕ). We only prove the validity
of ∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(y,x,x)ϕ. Fix any model M, any variable assignment α and any
world w in M. We show that M, α, w |= ∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(y,x,x)ϕ. Fix any elements
d, e ∈D(w). We establish M, (α(x|d))(y|e), w |= [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(y,x,x)ϕ. By the validity of
(CO), it suﬃces to show M, (α(x|d))(y|e), w |= O(y,x,x)(ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ϕ). By Lemma
1, ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ϕ is valid. It follows from the necessitation law for O(y,x,x) that
O(y,x,x)(ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ϕ) is valid. This implies our goal immediately.
⊓⊔
Theorem 2 tells us that CGO and PGO principles holds when ϕ ∈FormL is a
ﬁrst-order formula or when ϕ ∈FormL does not contain any deontic operator and
{ x, y } ⊆FV(ϕ). Thus, as an application of Theorem 2, the following is an valid instance
of PGO and CGO, respectively:
∀x. ∀y. [Prom(x,y)Safe(y)]O(x,y,x)Safe(y),
∀x. ∀y. [Com(x,y)Safe(y)]O(y,x,x)Safe(y),
since Safe(y) is a ﬁrst-order formula.
CGO and PGO Principles enable us to describe conﬂicts of obligations without
triggering deontic explosion. Consider the following scenario.
Example 1. (cf. [13, p.96]) Suppose you receive a letter from your political guru, in
which she commands you to join an important political demonstration to be held in
Tokyo next month. Unfortunately, it is to be held on the very same day on which an
international one-day conference on logic is to be held in São Paulo, and you have
already promised your former student who organizes that conference that you will give
an invited lecture there. The conference is planned to be held in person and neither
pre-recorded video lectures nor on-line lectures are accepted. It is possible for you to
join the demonstration in Tokyo, but if you choose to do so, you will fail to keep your
promise. It is also possible for you to give a lecture at the conference in São Paulo,
but if you choose to do so, you will fail to obey your guru’s command. No available
means of transportation are fast enough to enable you to join both events on the same
day even though the time in São Paulo is 12 h behind the time in Tokyo. You have to
decide which alternative to choose.

In this scenario, your guru’s command is in conﬂict with your earlier promise. Let a
possible world w of a model N represent the situation before your promise, and take an
assignment α such that α(x) is your guru, α(y) is the student and α(z) is you. In addition,
let F(z) and G(z) be understood as meaning that z attends the conference in São Paulo
and that z join the demonstration in Tokyo. We further assume that all of x, y and z are
pairwise distinct in the world w of N. Then in the situation before your promise, the
following holds:
[Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]((O(z,y,z)F(z) ∧O(z,x,x)G(z))).
In what follows, let us establish that this holds in the world w of N. First of all, we have
the following, where the 1st item is a corollary of Theorem 2.
Proposition 5. The following are valid:
1. [Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]O(z,x,x)G(z),
2. ¬ ((y = x) ∧(z = x)) →[Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]O(z,y,z)F(z).
Proof. For Item 1, we proceed as follows. By Theorem 2, [Com(x,z)G(z)]O(z,x,x)G(z)
is valid. By Proposition 4, [Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]O(z,x,x)G(z) is also valid, as
desired.
For Item 2, let us ﬁx any model M = (W, D, R□, RO, V), any variable assignment α
and any world w ∈W such that the formula in the item is an αw-formula. Assume that
M, α, w |= ¬ ((y = x) ∧(z = x)). This means: it is not the case that both α(y) = α(x)
and α(z) = α(x) hold. We show M, α, w |= [Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]O(z,y,z)F(z).
By putting πF := Prom(z,y)F(z) and πG := Com(x,z)G(z), it suﬃces to prove that
(MπF
α )πG
α , α, w |= O(z,y,z)F(z). Let us denote by RπF;πG
O
the deontic accessibility relations
in the resulting model (MπF
α )πG
α . Let us ﬁx any world v such that (w, v) belongs to the
deontic accessibility relation for RπF;πG
O
(α(z), α(y), α(z)). By assumption on x, y and z,
we obtain: (w, v) ∈RO(α(z), α(y), α(z)) and α(z) ∈V(F, v). Our goal is to show that
(MπF
α )πG
α , α, v |= F(z), i.e., α(z) ∈V(F, v) since the acts of commanding and promising
do not change a given valuation. But, this is already obtained.
⊓⊔
By Proposition 5 and our assumption on x, y, z at w of N, we conclude
that our formalization above holds at w of N, because both [Prom(z,y)F(z)] and
[Com(x,z)G(z)] are normal modal operators (as in Remark 3) and so the bundled operator
“[Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]” commutes with the conjunction.
Since if you join the demonstration in Tokyo, you cannot attend the conference in
São Paulo (this means that □(¬(F(z) ∧G(z))) holds at w of N), we may also be said to
have the following:
[Prom(z,y)F(z)][Com(x,z)G(z)]((O(z,y,z)F(z) ∧O(z,x,x)¬F(z))),
which is easily shown to hold at w of N.
Thus, DCTSDAL= can show how an act of promising and an act of commanding
comes to be in conﬂict in concrete cases. Note, however, that this conﬂict of obligations
does not lead to deontic explosion as O(z,y,z) and O(z,x,x) are distinct operators and ¬((y =
z)∧(z = x)) holds. And similarly, the following situations do not do so either if ¬(x = y)
holds.

1. N, α, w |= [Com(x,z)G(z)][Com(y,z)¬G(z)](O(z,x,x)G(z) ∧O(z,y,y)¬G(z)).
2. N, α, w |= [Prom(z,y)F(z)][Prom(z,x)¬F(z)](O(z,y,z)F(z) ∧O(z,x,z)¬F(z)).
By contrast, the following cases lead to deontic explosion.
3. N, α, w |= [Com(x,z)G(z)][Com(x,z)¬G(z)](O(z,x,x)G(z) ∧O(z,x,x)¬G(z)).
4. N, α, w |= [Prom(z,y)F(z)][Prom(z,y)¬F(z)](O(z,y,z)F(z) ∧O(z,y,z)¬F(z)).
Note that the deontic accessibility relation for the triple (α(z), α(x), α(x)), say, of
the updated model (N
Com(x,z)G(z)
α
)
Com(x,z)¬G(z)
α
is an empty set, since the ﬁrst update by
[Com(x,z)G(z)] cuts all the links to the worlds where G(z) does not hold and the second
update by [Com(x,z)¬G(z)] cuts all the links to the worlds where ¬G(z) does not hold.
Thus, for any ψ such that ψ is an αw-formula, we vacuously have:
N, α, w |= [Com(x,z)G(z)][Com(x,z)¬G(z)]O(z,x,x)ψ.
Issuing such a pair of commands (or issuing a command of the form [Com(x,y)(G(z) ∧
¬G(z))]) is irrational and should be avoided. A similar remark applies to acts of promis-
ing as well.
Remark 4. As is mentioned in Remark 1, the possibility of deontic explosion is mini-
mized in H(DCTSDAL=). Deontic explosion occurs only when one and the same agent
gives command(s) (or promise(s)) with contradictory content(s) to one and the same
addressee.

Deﬁnition 6. Hilbert system H(DCTSDAL=) is the extension of H(CTSDAL=) by all
the axioms of Tables 2 and 3 and the inference rules (NecC) and (NecP) as given in
Proposition 4. We deﬁne the notion of theorem as usual and use ⊢+ ϕ to mean that ϕ is
a theorem of H(DCTSDAL=).
Theorem 3. H(DCTSDAL=) is sound, i.e., for every formula ϕ ∈FormL+, if ϕ is a
theorem of H(DCTSDAL=) then ϕ is valid.
Proof. In addition to our argument for Theorem 1, Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 tell
us that all the remaining axioms are valid and all the remaining rules preserve validity.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 7. A translation t : FormL+ →FormL is deﬁned inductively as in Table 4.
Deﬁnition 8. Given a formula ϕ, we deﬁne the weight w(ϕ) of the formula ϕ as the
number of all occurrences of dynamic operators in ϕ inductively as follows:
w(P(x1, . . . , xn)) := 0,
w(z1 = zn) := 0,
w(¬ψ) := w(ψ),
w(ψ1 →ψ2) := w(ψ1) + w(ψ2),
w(∀z. ψ) := w(ψ),
w(□ψ) := w(ψ),
w(O(x,y,z)ψ) := w(ψ),
w([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) := w(ϕ) + w(ψ) + 1,
w([Prom(x,y)ϕ]ψ) := w(ϕ) + w(ψ) + 1.

Lemma 2. Let η ∈FormL, i.e., η does not contain any dynamic operators. Then, t(η) ∈
FormL, FV(η) = FV(t(η)) and the equivalence η ↔t(η) is a theorem of H(DCTSDAL=).
Proof. By induction on c(η), we can show that t(η) is an alphabetic variant of η, i.e.,
t(η) is obtained by renaming some of the bound variables in η. Then, all statements are
immediate.
⊓⊔
The following is crucial for applying replacement of equivalent formulas in
H(DCTSDAL=).
Lemma 3. For any formula η ∈FormL+, t(η) ∈FormL and FV(η) = FV(t(η)).
Proof. Because we add ⊤{ x,y }∪FV(ϕ) for our recursion axioms for atomic formulas in
Tables 2 and 3, we can obtain, for example,
FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn)) = { x, y } ∪FV(ϕ) ∪{ x1, . . . , xn }
= FV(⊤{ x,y }∪FV(ϕ) →P(x1, . . . , xn)).

Dynamiﬁed Common Sense Term-Sequence-Deontic-Alethic Logic

To be more precise, we establish the statements (i) t(η) ∈FormL and (ii) FV(η) =
FV(t(η)) simultaneously by induction on n = w(η). When n = 0, both (i) and (ii) are
obtained by Lemma 2.
Let n > 0 and suppose that both (i) and (ii) hold for every formula η such that
w(η) ⩽n. We are going to prove that both (i) and (ii) hold for every formula η such
that w(η) ⩽n + 1. We show both items by induction on the complexity c(η) (this is the
second induction or subinduction). In what follows, we only deal with the cases where
η = [Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn), [Com(x,y)ϕ](ψ1 →ψ2), or [Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ.
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn). (i) is immediate and (ii) is obvious
from our initial observation in this proof.
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ](ψ1 →ψ2). As for (i), t([Com(x,y)ϕ](ψ1 →ψ2))
= t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ1) →t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ2) ∈FormL by induction hypothesis of the
second induction. For (ii), we proceed as follows:
FV([Com(x,y)ϕ](ψ1 →ψ2)) = FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ1) ∪FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ2)
= FV(t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ1)) ∪FV(t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ2))
= FV(t([Com(x,y)ϕ](ψ1 →ψ2))),
where the second last equality is due to induction hypothesis of the second induction.
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ. First, we establish (i). By induc-
tion hypothesis of the second induction, we know that t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ) ∈FormL.
Because w([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) < w([Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]) ⩽n + 1, we
obtain w([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) ⩽n. Thus, it follows from induction hypothe-
sis of the ﬁrst induction (on weight n) that t([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) ∈FormL.
Second, we show (ii). By induction hypothesis of the second induction, we have
FV([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ) = FV(t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)). We proceed as follows:
FV([Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ) = { x, y } ∪FV(ϕ) ∪FV([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)
= { x, y } ∪FV(ϕ) ∪FV(t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ))
= FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)).
Since w([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) < w([Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]) ⩽n + 1, we have
w([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) ⩽n. By induction hypothesis of the ﬁrst induction,
we obtain
FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) = FV(t([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)))
= FV(t([Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)),
as desired.
⊓⊔
Lemma 4. For any formula η ∈FormL+, the equivalence η ↔t(η) is a theorem of
H(DCTSDAL=).
Proof. By induction on n = w(η), i.e., the number of occurrences of dynamic operators
in η. When n = 0 as basis, the desired statement holds by Lemma 2.
For inductive step, suppose that, for any formula η ∈FormL+ with w(η) ⩽n, we
have established ⊢+ η ↔t(η). We show that ⊢+ η ↔t(η) for all formulas η such

132
K. Sano and T. Yamada
that w(η) ⩽n + 1. This is shown by induction on the complexity c(η) (this is the sec-
ond induction or subinduction). In what follows, we only deal with the cases where
η is of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn), [Com(x,y)ϕ]□ψ, [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(x1,x2,x3)ψ, or
[Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ.
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn). By the deﬁnition of t, we show that
⊢+ [Com(x,y)ϕ]P(x1, . . . , xn) ↔(⊤{ x,y }∪FV(ϕ) →P(x1, . . . , xn)). But, this is the axiom
(CPr) of H(DCTSDAL=) (see Table 2).
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ]□ψ. We show that ⊢+
[Com(x,y)ϕ]□ψ
↔
t([Com(x,y)ϕ]□ψ).
By
deﬁnition,
we
show
that
⊢+
[Com(x,y)ϕ]□ψ
↔
□t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ). By the axiom (C□), it suﬃces to prove ⊢+ □[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ ↔
□t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ). By induction hypothesis for the second induction, we obtain ⊢+
[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ ↔t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ). It follows from Lemma 3 that FV([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)
= FV(t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)) hence ⊢+ □[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ ↔□t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) by (RE□) of
Proposition 2.
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(x1,x2,x3)ψ. We have to show that
⊢+ [Com(x,y)ϕ]O(x1,x2,x3)ψ ↔t([Com(x,y)ϕ]O(x1,x2,x3)ψ).
By the deﬁnition of t and the axiom (CO) of Table 2, it suﬃces to establish the fol-
lowing two equivalences in H(DCTSDAL)=:
((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x) →O(x1,x2,x3)(ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ))
↔((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x) →O(x1,x2,x3)(t(ϕ) →t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ))),
(¬((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x)) →O(x1,x2,x3)[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)
↔(¬((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x)) →O(x1,x2,x3)t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)).
First, we show the ﬁrst equivalence. By induction hypothesis for the second induc-
tion, we obtain ⊢+ ϕ ↔t(ϕ) and ⊢+ [Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ ↔t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ). Then, the
following implication hold:
⊢+ (x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x) →((ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) ↔(t(ϕ) →t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ))).
Because (ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) and (t(ϕ) →t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)) have the same set of free
variables by Lemma 3, it follows from (CREO) of Proposition 2 that:
⊢+ O(x1,x2,x3)((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x))
→(O(x1,x2,x3)(ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) ↔O(x1,x2,x3)(t(ϕ) →t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ))),
By (O =) from Proposition 2, we obtain:
⊢+ (x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x)
→(O(x1,x2,x3)(ϕ →[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ) ↔O(x1,x2,x3)(t(ϕ) →t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ))).
This implies our desired ﬁrst equivalence.
We move on to the second equivalence. It suﬃces to establish the following:
⊢+ ¬((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x))
→(O(x1,x2,x3)[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ ↔O(x1,x2,x3)t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)).

By (O ) from Proposition 2, it suﬃces to show the following:
⊢+ O(x1,x2,x3)¬((x1 = y) ∧(x2 = x) ∧(x3 = x))
→(O(x1,x2,x3)[Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ ↔O(x1,x2,x3)t([Com(x,y)ϕ]ψ)).
But, this can be established similarly to the ﬁrst equivalence.
– Let η be of the form [Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ. We show that
⊢+ [Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ ↔t([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)).
By induction hypothesis for the second induction, we have
⊢+ [Prom(z,u)χ]ψ ↔t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ).
It follows that
⊢+ [Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ ↔[Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ),
because [Com(x,y)ψ] is a normal modal operator (as in Remark 3). For our desired
goal, it suﬃces to establish
⊢+ [Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ) ↔t([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)).
But, this is obtained from induction hypothesis for the ﬁrst induction (on weight n),
because w([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) < w([Com(x,y)ϕ][Prom(z,u)χ]ψ) ⩽n + 1 by
Lemma 3 hence w([Com(x,y)ϕ]t([Prom(z,u)χ]ψ)) ⩽n. This ﬁnishes establishing the
desired equivalence.
⊓⊔
Theorem 4. Suppose that H(CTSDAL=) is semantically complete, i.e., for every
formula ϕ ∈FormL, if ϕ is valid then ϕ is a theorem of H(CTSDAL=). Then,
H(DCTSDAL=) is also semantically complete.
Proof. Suppose that H(CTSDAL=) is semantically complete and ﬁx any formula ϕ ∈
FormL+ such that ϕ is valid. By Lemma 4 and Theorem 3, ϕ ↔t(ϕ) is valid. Thus, t(ϕ) ∈
FormL is valid. By our initial supposition, t(ϕ) is a theorem of H(CTSDAL=). Since
H(DCTSDAL=) is an axiomatic expansion of H(CTSDAL=), t(ϕ) is also a theorem of
H(DCTSDAL=). By Lemma 4, we conclude that ϕ is a theorem of H(DCTSDAL=), as
required.

Conclusion
We have established that Hilbert system H(DCTSDAL=) is semantically complete rela-
tive to H(CTSDAL=) (see Theorem 4). The language of DCTSDAL= enables us to state
various general remarks concerning how acts of commanding and promising work as
we have seen in Sect. 3. As is clear, however, there are many remaining tasks, questions
and possibilities for further research.
First of all, as we have stated in Remark 2, the semantic completeness of
H(CTSDAL=) is still open. In this stage, what we have obtained so far is the semantic
completeness of the fragment of H(CTSDAL=) without the equality symbol as in [16].

Second, we may expand classes of formulas as given in Theorem 2 by keeping the
validity of CGO and PGO principles. For example, the formula
[Com(x,y)O(x,y,x)(P(z) →P(z))]O(y,x,x)O(x,y,x)(P(z) →P(z))
is easily seen to be valid, but such formula is not covered by our syntactic conditions
given in Theorem 2. But, we could not have CGO and PGO principles for the set of all
formulas in the sense of Deﬁnition 5. This is because the following formula
[Com(x,y)¬O(y,x,x)¬P(y)]O(y,x,x)¬O(y,x,x)¬P(y)
is not valid, which is similar to the result that a Moore sentence is not successful [11,
p.73, Example 4.5 and Sect. 4.7].
The remaining direction of further research is concerned with syntactic expansions
of our language in this paper. As we only have variables as terms in our syntax for
DCTSDAL=, one of the obvious remaining task is to introduce individual constants and
function symbols into the language. We may also introduce epistemic modality, which
enables us to capture eﬀects of acts of requesting and asserting as the development
of dynamic modal propositional logics of acts of requesting and asserting in [14,15]
suggest. A slightly diﬀerent possibility is that of introducing model updating operations
diﬀerent from the link-cutting utilized in DCTSDAL=. For example, see discussions of
updates in [2,3,5].

Abstract. This paper re-examines the ongoing debate on whether overt
aspect marking is required for expressing episodic readings in Mandarin
Chinese [22,28,30,47,49,50,52,53]. I establish the generalization that
overt aspect marking can be optional when the information concerning the
occurrence of the event is NOT at-issue in the discourse, which is supported
by both the new data on clause-embedding predicates and the existing
observations in [37,45,46,50]. In addition, I show that zero-marked sen-
tences in Mandarin are imperfective sentences which do not entail but are
compatible with episodic interpretations. A formal pragmatic account is
proposed to capture the discourse-sensitivity of such a requirement, mak-
ing use of the unidimensional incremental dynamic theory of meaning in
[2,3] and the Gricean theory of implicatures [5,19,27,42].

Introduction
Mandarin Chinese, as a morphologically tenseless language, relies on various
mechanisms including lexical aspect, viewpoint aspect markers, temporal adver-
bials to express the temporal information of a sentence [37,45,46]. In particu-
lar, it has been argued that viewpoint aspect markers are generally required
for (root) episodic sentences, namely those expressing the (partial) realiza-
tion of a speciﬁc event within a contextually-relevant interval (i.e. Topic Time)
[22,24,28,30,47,49,50,52,53]. A sentence involving a zero-marked eventive pred-
icate such as (1) can only express a habitual reading (with appropriate frequency-
indicating phrases) but not episodic readings as in (2), even with the presence
of frame adverbials such as zuotian ‘yesterday’ in the latter.

In order to obtain episodic readings, overt (viewpoint) aspect markers such
as the perfective -le or the progressive zai should be added, as in (3).1 Otherwise,
sentences such as those in (2) sound “incomplete”.

One prevailing explanation for the degradedness of the sentences in (2)
(incompleteness, henceforth2) is that those sentences without overt aspect mark-
ers are syntactically or (/and) semantically ﬂawed for the same reason that a bare
sentence such as “Lisi meet Mary (yesterday)” is unacceptable in English. From
the syntactic perspective, a bare sentence fails to project a certain size of struc-
ture (e.g. TP/IP, CP) that is required for being independent utterances [49,50].
From the semantic perspective, a sentence radical only describes a property of
events and cannot denote the proposition that the event has occurred within the
topic time without temporal operators such as aspect and tense [24,28,47].
However, what is tricky about Mandarin is that we do ﬁnd many cases that
are exempt from incompleteness.3 It has been reported that a zero-marked sen-
tence, when containing focus, can obtain episodic interpretations (4) [48,50].

1 When overt aspect markers are present, frame adverbials are largely optional.
Though see [23,35,50] for discussion on certain sentences with the perfective -le
and a dummy object, which could still sound incomplete without frame adverbials.
2 I use “incompleteness” as a descriptive label and will not discuss other kinds of
“incomplete” sentences [22,35,50,52] in this paper. The reason is that without a
careful examination and comparison of those phenomena, one cannot conclude that
all sentences that sound incomplete intuitively should receive the same analysis.
3 In fact, some authors [37,45] claim that viewpoint aspect markers are generally
optional for episodic sentences though such a claim has been argued to be empirically
incorrect due to the degradedness in (2), see [24,47,53].
4 In particular, the meaning of (4) is underspeciﬁed between an event-completion
reading and an event-in-progress reading, which accords with [45]’s observation about
Mandarin zero-marked sentences. According to [37,46], which reading is more salient
is subject to a variety of factors such as context, world knowledge, the length of the
Topic Time, and the lexical aspect of the predicate. For the examples of zero-marked
sentences in the rest of the paper, I will just list one available (and usually salient)
reading but it does not mean the listed one is the only possible reading.

[7,45,46,54] also point out in certain narratives such as (5), zero-marked
sentences can also obtain episodic interpretations.

‘This morning, Lisi ran, ate breakfast, and then went school.’
The existing syntactic-semantic approaches are problematic in that they
either ignore the data like (4)–(5) and claim that incompleteness exists across
the board [28,47], or they have to assume that adding focus is another way
of satisfying a certain syntactic/semantic requirement satisﬁed by the aspect
markers in (3). A representative of the latter by [50] (see also [22]) proposes
that a sentence can either be “anchored” by temporal operators (in the sense
of [12]) or by focus operators. One concern for this kind of approach is that it
is cross-linguistically uncommon for focus to have the same syntactic/semantic
functions as aspect markers, leaving this binary condition of anchoring unmoti-
vated.5 Moreover, the binary condition is still too strong in that many narration
examples given in [45,46,54], including (5), have neutral intonation and can
be uttered in out-of-the-blue contexts; therefore their acceptability cannot be
straightforwardly attributed to the presence of focus.
The goal of this paper is to argue that incompleteness in Mandarin can
be better captured by a pragmatic approach. The motivations are twofold.
Firstly, I establish the novel generalization that incompleteness is sensitive to
what information is at-issue in the discourse, based on both the novel piece
of data on clause-embedding predicates and the existing observations such as
(4)–(5) [37,45,46,54]. Secondly, there is reason to believe that those apparently
bare sentences are in fact syntactically and semantically well-formed – they can
express habitual readings and are just constrained in terms of expressing episodic
readings. Based on those motivations, a formal dynamic pragmatic account is
proposed to capture the discourse-sensitivity of incompleteness.
The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present two motivations
of pursuing a pragmatic approach of incompleteness. Section 4 proposes a for-
mal pragmatic analysis, making use of the unidimensional incremental dynamic
theory of meaning in [2,3] and the Gricean theory of implicatures [5,19,27,42].
Section 5 concludes.

Incompleteness Correlates with What is at-Issue
In this section, I present new data concerning clause-embedding predicates in
Mandarin to advance the novel generalization in (6).
5 [50] attributes the cross-linguistic diﬀerence between Mandarin and English in the
availability of focus anchoring to the parametric variation in the (non)-existence
of empty particles; but they do not discuss how focus anchoring contributes to an
episodic reading semantically.

Incompleteness and (not-)at-issue Updates in Mandarin Chinese
139
(6)
Incompleteness arises ONLY when the inference concerning the occur-
rence of the event (described by the zero-marked predicate) is the main
point of the utterance, or is at-issue.
Then I show that this generalization can also capture the existing observa-
tions that zero-marked sentences with focus or those within certain narratives
do not suﬀer from incompleteness [45,46,50].
How do one tell whether an inference of a certain utterance is at-issue or
not? One useful diagnostics is that at-issue inferences can address the Question
Under Discussion in the discourse [29,41,44,51]. In particular, we can form a
question-answer pair to see whether the utterance can be a felicitous response
to a question to which that inference is relevant.6 Consider an English sentence
containing an appositive such as (7). While one can infer both (7-a) and (7-b)
from such an utterance, the discourse statuses of those two inferences are not
equivalent – only the former is considered to be at-issue since this utterance is a
felicitous response to a question to which the inference (7-a) is relevant, but not
to a question to which the inference (7-b) is relevant, c.f. (8), (9).

2.1
New Data Concerning Clause-Embedding Predicates
When an eventive verb embeds a (complete7) clausal complement, overt aspect
marking on that matrix verb can be optional for expressing episodic readings,
as in (10). Note that shuo ‘say’ in Mandarin is a regular eventive verb since if
we replace the clausal complement with a nominal object as in (11), the incom-
pleteness eﬀect comes back.8

6 For the purpose of this paper, it is suﬃcient to adopt the following simpliﬁed deﬁni-
tion of relevance: a proposition p is relevant to a question Q if p contextually entails
a (partial) answer of Q.
7 I call the embedded stative clause as “complete” because stative sentences do not
need aspect markers and they can always stand as independent utterances.
8 While there is no space to present more data in this paper, note that the contrast
like (10) and (11) is prevalent for a large set of clause-embedding eventive verbs in
Mandarin including gaosu ‘tell’, tingshuo ‘hear’, xuanbu ‘announce’.

I propose that overt aspect marking is optional there because (10) can present
either the embedded or the matrix content as the at-issue proposal (i.e. the main
point), which is common for biclasual constructions cross-linguistically [40,43].
When we make the Question Under Discussion (QUD) explicitly concern the
embedded content of (10), -le is indeed optional on shuo, as in (12). In this case,
the matrix predication does not need to be the main point of the utterance but
can serve a secondary, evidential-like function, namely specifying the source of
the information expressed by the embedded sentence.

A:

By contrast, when the QUD is explicitly made to concern the realization of
the matrix event as in (13), it is pragmatically odd to answer the question with
the aspectually zero-marked version of (10).

‘Why were you so impatient when I was reporting the weather?’
A:#(10) without -le; ✓(10) with -le
The contrast between (12) and (13) shows that when -le is omitted in (10),
the inference concerning the occurrence of the saying event is not at-issue. In
other words, embedding a clausal complement makes it possible to put forth the
content of that clausal complement as the at-issue proposal and in this case the
matrix proposition serves as a secondary point like an evidential phrase. For this
reason, overt aspect markers can be optional on the matrix eventive verbs.
Turning to the monoclausal use of the verb shuo ‘say’ in (11), or other mon-
clausal sentences uttered with neutral intonation in general (e.g. (2)), incom-
pleteness arises because in those cases the occurrence of the matrix event is by
default at-issue in an out-of-the-blue context. This intuition is reﬂected in the
assumption of the literature that the default QUD in such a context is ‘What
happened?’ or ‘What’s new?’ [1,14,31,41]. The reason why many authors treat
incompleteness as a context-free grammaticality requirement is because they
happen to focus on monoclausal sentences uttered in out-of-the-blue contexts
such as (11) and (2).
2.2
Extending to the Existing Observations
This section shows that the proposed generalization in (6) can further capture
the existing observations that narratives and focus can salvage incompleteness.

Incompleteness and (not-)at-issue Updates in Mandarin Chinese
141
Within Narratives. When a zero-marked eventive sentence is uttered with
other matrix sentences to form a sequence (i.e. a narrative), overt aspect marking
can be optional for episodic interpretations. In (14), the zero-marked sentence
is followed by a complete sentence (e.g. a zero-marked stative sentence or an
aspectually marked eventive one), and the entire utterance can be acceptable.

[7] provides many examples from corpora to support this tendency (see also
[46,54]). One example reproduced in (15) is from Lu Xun’s novel Yao “Medicine”:
all the events described in the narrative indeed occurred, and only the last verb
miman “ﬁll” is overtly marked with the perfective.

‘Hua Laoshuan suddenly sat up, (and) striking a match, lit the com-

I argue that zero-marked eventive sentences are not degraded in cases like
(14) and (15) because it is possible to have the other sentence(s) to contribute
the at-issue update of the discourse while making the realization of the event
described by the zero-marked predicate a secondary point of the utterance. Take
(14) for instance, that its ﬁrst clause is not at-issue can be conﬁrmed by the
infelicity of uttering (14) as a response to the question ‘Did Lisi met anyone?’:

Another typical kind of narrative in which incompleteness disappears is a
run-on sentence like (18), in which all the predicates are zero-marked but it
conveys that a sequence of events occurred one after one this morning.

This kind of utterance naturally occurs in a context in which it is taken for
granted that a sequence of events has occurred during the topic time (e.g. when
reporting one’s daily routine), and the main point of uttering (18) is to inform
about the content of each event and their order.9 It is indeed quite odd to use
(18) to answer a neutral polar question such as (19), which concerns whether
each relevant event is actualized or not.

In words, zero-marked episodic sentences within certain narratives are not
degraded because it is possible to have the occurrence of the event expressed by
the zero-marked predicate as not-at-issue information in those cases.
The Presence of Focus. Sentences with focus are often exempt from incom-
pleteness (see also [22,50]), as in (20).

‘It is [Mary]F that Lisi met yesterday’
I propose that incompleteness disappears in those cases because with the
presence of focus, the occurrence of some event is in fact presupposed in the
context, and presupposed contents are typically not at-issue. Indeed, the sen-
tences in (20) are naturally uttered in contexts in which it is already in the
common ground that some event has occurred. In (21), it is already known that
Lisi met someone yesterday, and the main point of B’s utterance concerns who
Lisi met.

9 One reviewer raises a similar example in which the utterance contains multiple sen-
tences and none of the verbs are aspectually marked. In particular, that example
serves as an answer to a why-question, which strongly presupposes the occurrence of
some event as the cause and the at-issue update concerns the event content instead
of its occurrence. For this reason, I do not think those examples threaten the current
generalization.

The presupposed status of the event occurrence inference in those examples
can be further conﬁrmed by their ability to project over entailment-canceling
operators, as illustrated in (22).

In words, focused sentences are exempt from incompleteness because in those
cases the information that some event has occurred within the topic time is not
at-issue (i.e. presupposed).
2.3
Interim Summary
This section shows that what is shared by the cases in which incompleteness dis-
appears is that the information concerning the occurrence of the event (described
by the zero-marked predicate) is NOT at-issue: embedding a clausal complement
makes it possible for the matrix predication to serve an evidential-like function,
which is a secondary point of the utterance; creating a narrative can shift the
main point of the utterance to be some other inferences; and adding focus renders
such information presupposed.
3
Zero-Marked Sentences are Imperfective Sentences
Besides the discourse-sensitivity of incompleteness illustrated in Sect. 2, this
section provides another reason why a pragmatic account might be appealing
– zero-marked sentences in Mandarin are in fact syntactically and semantically
well-formed (under certain readings).
3.1
Imperfective Uses of Mandarin Zero-Marked Sentences
Zero-marked sentences in Mandarin are typically used to convey habitual read-
ings as in (1) (repeated as (23)), futurate readings such as (24), and continuous
readings (for stative predicates) as in (25).

Those readings are usually expressed by the imperfective form across lan-

in languages such as Russian and Spanish [17,21].

Together with the fact that Mandarin zero-marked sentences are indeed
acceptable for episodic readings in a lot of cases (as shown in Sect. 3), one
hypothesis is that zero-marked sentences are grammatical in the ﬁrst place and
they are just the counterparts of imperfective forms in other languages. They
cannot freely express episodic readings just like how imperfective forms in many
languages do not typically express episodic readings but can do so in a restricted
way [4,9,17,21]. For instance, the imperfective form in French is not typically
used for expressing event-completion readings, but it can express perfective-like
readings in a narrative such as (27), which is quite similar to how Mandarin
zero-marked sentences can express episodic readings in run-on sentences.

(Adapted from [26])
The imperfective form in Spanish also cannot freely express event-in-progress
readings but [17] claims that it can do so when all discourse participants have
perceptual access to the ongoing event. The mutual perceptual access in the
context makes it easy to accommodate the occurrence of the relevant event,
and this condition resembles how zero-marked sentences with focus can express
episodic readings in Mandarin.
While the speciﬁc constraints of using imperfective forms to express episodic
readings in those languages are not identical to that in Mandarin, they do over-
lap, which points to the possibility that zero-marked sentence in Mandarin are
grammatical and meaningful imperfective forms which are just constrained in
terms of conveying episodic readings.
3.2
The Literal Meaning of Zero-Marked Imperfective Forms
If a zero-marked sentence is an imperfective sentence, then what kind of meaning
does it express? Following a standard intensional analysis of the imperfective

145
aspect [4,9–11,15,16,33], I argue that it does not anchor the event described by
the predicate to the evaluation world, but instead to the inertia continuations of
the evaluation world (since the topic time), namely the possible worlds that are
identical to the evaluation world w before the topic time and develop in ways
most compatible with the regular course of the relevant aﬀairs since the topic
time. The lexical entry of a null imperfective morpheme in Mandarin, ∅impf, is
given in (28).
(28)
∅impf = λP⟨s,vt⟩λwλi.∀w′ ∈INERT(w, i) : ∃e[P(e, w′) ∧τ(e, w′) ⊇i]
The modal base “INERT(w, i)” takes the evaluation world w and the topic
time i and returns a set of inertia worlds. This modal component is crucial in
that it captures the intensional character of the imperfective uses. For a habitual
sentence such as ‘Lisi meets Mary’, it entails a regular occurrence of the event
of Lisi meeting Mary not necessarily in the actual world but in an ideal world in
which nothing interrupts the normal schedule of Lisi and Mary (and any other
relevant aﬀairs). For a futurate sentence like ‘Lisi meets Mary tomorrow’, it
entails the occurrence of Lisi meeting Mary tomorrow in ideal worlds in which the
plan made at or before the speech time is not interrupted. For stative sentences
[15,16] also argue that the lexical entry in (28) can capture the ongoingness of
a state during the topic time, except that the inertia modality is vacuous due to
the diﬀerent properties of states compared to events.
This paper does not intend to discuss the formal details of how (28) can
capture the diﬀerent imperfective uses, and the interested readers can refer to
[9,11,15,16,33]. What is crucial to the current discussion is that, an imperfective
form, even when the topic time is overtly restricted by the frame adverbials such
as gangcai ‘just now’ or xianzai ‘now’, does not entail the occurrence of the
event in the actual world. The sentence in (29) for instance, can at best express
a futurate-like reading as in (30), and due to the modal nature of imperfective,
it does not entail the occurrence of the meeting event in the actual world.

10 The temporal interval variable i in (30-a), which represents the topic time, is existen-
tially bound either by some covert tense operator as in [24,47] or via some semantic
rule as in [34,37,46]. This particular choice of how to relate topic time to the speech
time is orthogonal to the current investigation, and for this reason, I will directly
present the result of this semantic process as in (30-b).

Still, this semantics is compatible with the scenarios in which the meeting
event occurred just now – it is clearly possible that nothing interrupts the normal
course of the relevant aﬀairs in the actual world, and in this case the meeting
event should have occurred within the topic time.

Interim Summary
This section showed that the literal meaning of a zero-marked sentence involves
imperfective semantics and is truth-conditionally weaker than the episodic read-
ing that the relevant event is instantiated within the topic time in the evaluation
world, but is nevertheless compatible with it. Importantly, zero-marked sentences
are not ungrammatical, but are just not typically used for expressing episodic
readings, which is quite common cross-linguistically.

A Formal Pragmatic Account
This section proposes a formal pragmatic account of Mandarin incompleteness.
The main idea is that a zero-marked sentence can obtain episodic readings
because its imperfective semantics can be strengthened into such readings via
some pragmatic principle (i.e. Gricean Maxims [5,19]). However, such enrichment
can be blocked due to the competition between the zero-marked imperfective
form and the better alternatives of expressing episodic readings. The blocking
eﬀect is obligatory when such information is directly relevant to the QUD, which
results in the observed discourse-sensitivity of incompleteness.
Section 4.1 brieﬂy introduces the basic setup for the formal dynamic imple-
mentation. Section 4.2 proposes that zero-marked sentences can express episodic
readings at least in certain cases via pragmatic enrichment, while such pragmatic
enrichment is not always available due to aspectual competition.
4.1
Formal Setup
Since we will need to formally distinguish between at-issue and not-at-issue infor-
mation in the discourse, and keep track of the anaphoric information across at-
issue and not-at-issue updates, I adopt a unidimensional incremental dynamic
theory of meaning in [2,3] (which is based on [13,20,41]).
[3] propose to treat discourse contexts as sets containing the classic Stal-
nakerian Context Set and all their subsets, and use the designated propositional
variable pcs to store the current Context Set (CS). For an at-issue assertion,
it puts forth a proposal, which is stored with a propositional discourse referent
(dref henceforth), p, to update the CS by restricting possible future contexts to
those that have non-empty intersections with p, namely pcs ∩p. If accepted, the
CS is updated by assigning a new value to the dref pcs (‘:=’ is used to indicate
(re)assignment of values to variables):
(31)
pcs := pcs ∩p

Incompleteness and (not-)at-issue Updates in Mandarin Chinese
147
For not-at-issue updates, such as those contributed by appositive or evidential
content, they do not put forth a proposal but directly eliminate the assignments
that assign to pcs at least one world in which the proposition is not true, and
this process is called “an imposal” by [3]. This reﬂects the distinction made in
[13] that not-at-issue updates happen automatically without regular negotiation
associated with at-issue updates. For presuppositions, which are not at-issue and
old information, they are treated as preconditions on the input CS.
The dynamic theory is implemented in an extension of Dynamic Predicate
Logic [2,3,20]. Our models consist of domains of individuals D, eventualities E,
temporal intervals T , and possible worlds W, and the interpretation function
I that assigns a subset of Dn to any n-ary relation R relative to any world
w, i.e., Iw(R) ⊆Dn. We have variables over individuals (x, y, z...), eventuali-
ties (e1, e2, ...), temporal intervals (i1, i2, ...), and worlds (w, w′, ...) and proposi-
tions/sets of worlds (p, p′, pcs, q, l, m, ...), and the usual inventory of non-logical
constants: individual constants (John, . . .), properties (person, yesterday,
...), n-relations (meet, ...), etc.
Formulas are interpreted relative to a pair of assignments ⟨g, h⟩, i.e., they
denote functions from an input assignment g to an output assignment h. New
variables are introduced via random assignments as in (32). In particular, certain
variables can be relativized to worlds (33):
(32)
[p]⟨g,h⟩= 1 iﬀfor any variable p′ s.t. p′ ̸= p: g(p′) = h(p′)
(33)

for any variable x′ s.t. x′ ̸= x: g(x′) = h(x′), and
b.

Dom(h(x)) = h(pcs) if p ⊆pcs is the at-issue proposal
Dom(h(x)) = h(p) otherwise
Atomic formulas are deﬁned if the preconditions are satisﬁed, and lexical rela-
tions are interpreted relative to propositions, as in (34):
(34)
a.
Rp(x1, ..., xn)⟨g,h⟩is deﬁned iﬀfor any i ∈{1, .., n}, h(p) ⊆

w ∈h(p): ⟨h(x1)(w), ..., h(xn)(w)⟩∈Iw(R)
For complex formula, (35) provides a partial list of the interpretation rules
(adapted from [3]): dynamic conjunction in (35a); negation in (35b); the inertia
modal base in the imperfective semantics which is relativized to both worlds and
time intervals as in (35c).

4.2
Pragmatic Enrichment and Aspectual Competition
This section aims to explain why zero-marked sentences, which do not entail the
event realization inference as shown in Sect. 3, can express episodic readings, but
only when such an inference is not at-issue.
I start with the key piece of data (the evidential case) in (36). I follow Mur-
ray’s analysis of evidentiality in [40] such that the matrix proposition is imposed
on the CS (37a, 37c), while a modalized version of the embedded proposition
is put forth as the at-issue proposal (37b). I leave out the modal part of the
at-issue proposal for simplicity since it is irrelevant to our discussion.

⇝Quantity2 [e1] ∧saypcs(e1, x, q) ∧τpcs(e1) ⊇i1
Since the matrix verb shuo combines with a null imperfective, it does not entail
the occurrence of the saying event in the actual world, but only says the event has
occurred within those ideal inertia worlds in which the relevant aﬀairs develop
in a regular course. Crucially, I follow [6] in arguing that the default assumption,
when no other information uttered by the speaker or in the context contracts it,
is that the actual world indeed develops inertially so that the saying event has
occurred within the topic time (i1), as represented in (37-d).11 I further identify
the source of this reasoning as the Gricean Maxim of Quantity-2 ‘Say no more
than you need’ [19]. [5,25] elaborate it as ‘What is stereotypical needs not be
said’. (38) for instance, by default invites the implicature that John broke his own
ﬁnger, since breaking one’s own ﬁnger is the stereotypical, unmarked situation. I
argue that the same kind of reasoning is at play for the zero-marked imperfective
sentence in (36).
(38)
John broke a ﬁnger.
⇝Quantity2 John broke his ﬁnger.
Indeed, we ﬁnd the event realization inference expressed by the Mandarin zero-
marked sentence can be defeasible, as long as it is compatible with the contextual
11 [6] uses this reasoning to explain why accomplishments in St’´at’imcets and
Skwxw´u7mesh can invite a default culmination inference, though defeasible.

tinued with a sentence that contradicts the event realization inference.

The question is, if a zero-marked sentence can obtain episodic readings via
this pragmatic enrichment, why such reading is not always available? In partic-
ular, why is a zero-marked sentence uttered out-of-the-blue (repeated as in (40))
considered to be incomplete?

Representing the update made by the utterance in (40) formally as in (41-a), we
ﬁnd the main diﬀerence between (36) and (40) lies in the whether the occurrence
of the event within the topic time is part of the at-issue proposal or not.
(41)

(In principle possible:)
⇝Quantity2 [e1] ∧meetp(e1, x, y) ∧τp(e1) ⊇i1
I argue that (41-a) fails to obtain episodic readings via (41-b) because when
the occurrence of the event is at-issue as in (41-a), the ‘better’ alternatives
are mandatorily evoked, namely those with overt aspect markers. According to
the Gricean Maxim of Quantity-1 ‘Say as much as you can (if relevant)’ and
the subsequent neo-Gricean theories, the speaker is expected to use the truth-
conditionally stronger but no more complex alternatives (when relevant), and if
not, there arises a Quantity-1 implicature that it is not the case that the stronger
alternatives are true [19,27,42]. Now let us check if the alternatives marked by
the overt perfective or progressive are both truth-conditionally stronger and no
more complex than the imperfective form.
First, following a standard analysis of viewpoint aspects ( [24,36,45,47,55]),
the sentence involving the perfective -le entails the completion of the event within
the topic time in the evaluation world (42); the sentence involving the progres-
sive zai entails the partial realization of the eventuality in the evaluation world
(43). The variations between the existing analyses are not our concern: what is
uncontroversial is that the sentences involving the overt perfective or progressive
markers must be truth-conditionally stronger than the sentences involving the
zero-marked imperfective morpheme, since the latter does not entail even the
partial realization of the event in the evaluation world (44).

∧∀w′ ∈INERT(w, i) : ∃e[meet(e, l, m, w′) ∧τ(e, w′) ⊇i]]
Second, adopting the concept of structural complexity in [27], the alternatives
in (42) and (43) are no more complex than (44) because they can be derived
from the syntactic structure of the uttered sentence (44) by substituting the
covert imperfective morpheme with overt aspectual morphemes. Note that since
the complexity of alternatives based on their structure, the zero phonology of
the imperfective morpheme does not factor into the complexity measure since
(44) projects a structure of the same size as the overtly marked alternatives.
In words, not using those “better” alternatives when relevant potentially
gives rise to an implicature that contradicts (41-b), as represented in (45)
(45)
⇝Quantity1 NOTp′
p ([e1p′ ] ∧meetp′(e1, x, y) ∧τp′(e1) ⊆i1)
I propose that this “problematic” Quantity-1 implicature is mandatorily trig-
gered when those better alternatives are directly relevant to the Question Under
Discussion (see similar assumptions in [8,25,32]), alternatively speaking, when
the semantic contribution of the imperfective is part of the at-issue proposal. In
the case of (40), since the information contributed by the imperfective is at-issue,
and the Quantity-1 implicature is mandatory and blocks the potential pragmatic
enrichment via Maxim of Quantity-2. In the case of uttering the biclausal con-
struction such as (36), since the information contributed by the imperfective
is imposed, the Quantity-1 implicature is optional, which makes the pragmatic
enrichment possible. For this reason, zero-marked sentences can only express
episodic readings in restricted cases, namely when the information concerning
the event occurrence is not at-issue.
The rest of this section illustrates how the proposed analysis can extend to
the cases in which incompleteness disappears, namely zero-marked sentences in
narratives or those with focus.
I have shown in Sect. 2 that, in a narrative such as (46), the proposition
denoted by the ﬁrst sentence is not-at-issue while the second stative sentence
constitutes the at-issue proposal. The discourse update contributed by the entire
(46) can be formalized in (47). Since the information contributed by the imper-
fective is imposed as in (47a), the better alternatives marked by the overt aspect
markers are not directly relevant to the QUD and the potential Quantity-1
implicature is optional. For this reason, pragmatic enrichment via the Maxim of
Quantity-2 is not blocked.

In short, since episodic readings can be obtained via pragmatic enrichment
for zero-marked sentences in those narratives, no incompleteness arises.
Finally, for a zero-marked sentence with focus as in (48B), we’ve shown that
it is normally uttered in a context in which it is already taken for granted that
there is an event of Lisi meeting someone (e1) completed within i1 (49a). While
the zero-marked imperfective sentence does not assert the occurrence of the event
(49b), we can not only infer by default that the event of John meeting Mary has
occurred within the topic time but also that this event is the same event as e1.
Via this kind of reasoning, we can see that the at-issue proposal put forth by
B’s utterance in fact concerns identifying the theme of e1 as Mary (49c).

Since the occurrence of the event is also not directly relevant to the QUD
(i.e. it is presupposed), there is no mandatory Quantity-1 implicature, and the
pragmatic enrichment in (49c) is not blocked.
4.3
Interim Summary
In sum, the constrained, QUD-sensitive use of zero-marked sentences (i.e. imper-
fective forms) for episodic readings can be attributed to the interaction between
two opposing sub-maxims under the Maxim of Quantity: Quantity-2 ‘Say no
more than you need’ and Quantity-1 ‘Say as much as you can (if relevant)’.
The zero-marked form can be strengthened into episodic interpretations via the
former sub-maxim, but such strengthening is not always successful because of
the mandatory consideration of the better alternatives of expressing episodic
readings when the occurrence of the event is at-issue in the discourse, due to the
latter sub-maxim.

Conclusion
This paper investigated the incompleteness puzzle in Mandarin, namely zero-
marked eventive sentences often sound degraded for episodic readings, with a
novel pragmatic perspective. Inspired by the existing observations that incom-
pleteness is not a context-free, across-the-board constraint [37,45,46,54], I estab-
lished the novel generalization that incompleteness arises only when the occur-
rence of the event is (part of) the at-issue proposal put forth by an utterance.
The generalization is motivated by the new data on clause-embedding eventive
predicates in Mandarin, and can capture the existing observations that sentences
within narratives or focused sentences generally do not suﬀer from incomplete-
ness. Furthermore, I argued that Mandarin zero-marked sentences are in fact
imperfective sentences since they can express typical imperfective readings, and
it is not uncommon cross-linguistically for imperfective forms to express episodic
readings in a constrained way. I proposed the ﬁrst formal pragmatic account to
capture the discourse-sensitivity of incompleteness, which involves an interaction
between two sub-maxims under the Gricean Maxim of Quantity.
The current study raises a lot of open questions for future investigation. One
concerns the cross-linguistic variation in the constraints of using imperfective
forms for episodic readings (i.e. event-in-progress/event-completion readings).
Previous studies have shown that the episodic use of the imperfective form can
be blocked or constrained due to the availability of the more speciﬁc progres-
sive or perfective markers in a language [9,17] and [21] shows in Russian how
information structure regulates the aspectual competition between the perfective
form and the imperfective form for expressing event-completion readings. It will
be interesting to see how the aspectual competition between the zero-marked
imperfective form and the progressive/perfective marker in Mandarin, which
is regulated by what is at-issue in the discourse, can ﬁt into this big picture.
Another question is whether a similar pragmatic approach can be pursued for
the other kinds of “incomplete” sentences in Mandarin such as (50). While this
paper remains agnostic about whether diﬀerent kinds of incompleteness should
receive a uniform analysis or not, the fact that (50) can also improve with focus
[18,38,39] suggests a pragmatic perspective can be promising.

Comparing the Derivation of Modal
Domains and Strengthened Meanings

Abstract. The derivation of strengthened meanings as proposed by
Bar-Lev and Fox (2017, 2020) and the derivation of modal domains as
proposed by Kratzer (1977, 1981, 1991) both involve an “inclusion” step
of assigning true to as many propositions in a given set as possible. In the
case of strengthened meanings, this set contains the scalar alternatives.
In the case of modal domains, it contains the propositions in the ordering
source. In this note, we explicate what is common and what is distinct
between the two inclusion procedures. We then point out that the formal
distinction makes no empirical diﬀerence for the cases of strengthened
meaning so far considered in the literature. We conjecture that this fact
holds generally for all cases of strengthened meaning.

Two Steps of Exhaustiﬁcation
1.1
Exclusion
The “grammatical approach to implicatures” takes the strengthened meaning of
a sentence p, i.e. the conjunction of p and its implicatures, to result from applying
an exhaustivity operator exh to p (cf. Fox 2007; Chierchia et al. 2012). Fox (2007)
proposes that exh(p) assigns true to p, the “prejacent”, and assigns false to each
of the “innocently excludable alternatives”, henceforth “IE alternatives”, of p.1
We present Fox’s 2007 proposal in (1), where AIE
p
is the set of IE alternatives
of p and  S is the proposition that at least one member of S is true, for any

Discourse” (SPAGAD), ERC-2007-ADG 787929.
1 More precisely, exh(p) assigns true to p and assigns false to each of the IE alter-
natives of p which are relevant. For the purpose of this discussion, we will make the
simplifying assumption that the alternatives are all relevant. We do not believe this
assumption aﬀects our argument..

p
(i)
Take all maximal sets of propositions from Ap which can be assigned
false consistently with p
(ii) q ∈AIE
p

To illustrate, consider the Venn diagram below. Let p be the prejacent and q, r,
s, t and p itself be its alternatives.3 Logical relations are represented spatially
in the familiar way. Thus, we have p ⇒(s ∨r ∨t), (s ∧t) ⇒⊥, for example.

The maximal sets of propositions from Ap which can be assigned false consis-
tently with p are listed in (4).

a.

b.
{q, r, t}
c.
{q, s, t}
Note that neither {r, s, t} nor {q, r, s, t} is listed, as (¬r ∧¬s ∧¬t) ⇒¬p. Now,
looking at (4), we see that only q is a member of all three sets. Thus, only q is an
IE alternative of p, which means exh(p) ⇔p ∧¬q. This proposition is indicated
by the gray area in (5).
2 The attentive reader will notice that the deﬁnition in (1b) contains a redundancy.
Speciﬁcally, AIE
p
̸= ∅→¬  AIE
p
is equivalent to ¬  AIE
p , as  ∅is the contradic-
tion. The intuition which we want this redundant formulation to reﬂect is that the
computation proceeds only under the condition that the relevant set of altermatives
is not empty. That condition is logically idle for this case but not for all of the cases
which we will discuss..
3 We assume, as is standard, that every sentence is an alternative of itself (cf. Fox and
Katzir 2011).

The process of exhaustiﬁcation, as represented by exh, can therefore be
described, informally, as that of trying to assign false to as many alternatives as
possible, preserving consistency with the prejacent.
1.2
Inclusion
Bar-Lev and Fox (2017, 2020), henceforth BLF, propose that the exhaustivity
operator be modiﬁed. Speciﬁcally, they argue that it should be not exh but
exh′, as deﬁned in (6b), where exh remains as deﬁned in (1b), AII
p is the set of
“innocently includable alternatives”, henceforth “II alternative”, of p, and  S
is the proposition that every member of S is true, for any set S of propositions.4
Innocent inclusion is deﬁned in (7).
(6)
BLF’s proposal

The strengthened meaning of p is expressed by exh′(p)
b.

BLF’s deﬁnition of AII
p
(i)
Take all maximal sets of propositions from Ap which can be assigned
true consistently with exh(p)
(ii) q ∈AII
p iﬀq is in all such sets
What exh′(p) does, then, is assign true to exh(p) and also assign true to each of
the innocently includable alternatives of p.5. Consider, again, the Venn diagram
in (3). Let us ask which among q, r, s, t and p itself is an II alternative of p. The
maximal sets of propositions from Ap which can be assigned true consistently
with exh(p) are listed in (8).
(8)
a.
{p, r, s}
b.
{p, r, t}
4 Again, there is redundancy in (6b), as  ∅is the tautology. See note 2.
5 Note that BLF claims that II alternatives are assigned true obligatorily (cf. Bar-Lev
and Fox 2017, 111). Thus, the inferences associated with them cannot be cancelled
by them being considered irrelevant, as is possible in the case of IE alternatives (see
note 1)..

Modal Domains and Strengthened Meanings
159
Note that neither {p, s, t} nor {p, r, s, t} is listed: since s ∧t is contradictory,
no set containing s and t is consistent. Now, looking at the two sets in (8),
we see that only p and r are members of both. This means only p and r are II
alternatives of p, and that exh′(p) ⇔exh(p)∧p∧r ⇔p∧¬q∧r. This proposition
is indicated by the gray area in (9).
(9)
exh′(p) ⇔p ∧¬q ∧r
p
q
r
s
t
The process of exhaustiﬁcation, as represented by exh′, can therefore be
described, informally, as that of (i) trying to assign false to as many alternatives
as possible, preserving consistency with the prejacent, and then (ii) trying to
assign true to as many alternatives as possible, preserving consistency with the
output of (i). Thus, exh′(p) is a strengthening of exh(p). We can see this by
comparing the gray area of (5) with the gray area of (9): the latter is a subpart
of the former.
1.3
Empirical Motivation for exh′
BLF present a series of empirical arguments for identifying the strengthened
meaning of p with exh′(p) instead of exh(p). Given the scope of this note, we
will recite only one. The reader is invited to consult Bar-Lev and Fox (2017,
2020) to learn about the others.
The relevant data point is the sentence in (10), which has been argued to
license the inferences in (10a) and (10b) (cf. Chemla 2009).
(10)
No student is required to solve both problem A and problem B
¬∃x□(Px ∧Qx)
a.
 No student is required to solve problem A
¬∃xPx
b.
 No student is required to solve problem B
¬∃xQx
The syntactic analysis of (10) at the relevant level, i.e. its Logical Form, is
assumed to be something like (11).
(11)
[α no student λx [β is required to [γ tx solve A and tx solve B]]]
Given that required and and are both strong scalar items, exhaustifying β
or γ will be semantically inconsequential.6 The only scope site left for possibly
non-vacuous exhaustiﬁcation is the matrix node, which means the exhaustivity

operator must be applied to α. BLF take the alternatives of α to be derived from
α by replacing no (¬∃) with not every (¬∀), and with or, γ with its individual
conjuncts, and α with itself.7 We then have (12).
(12)
a.
Prejacent: ¬∃x□(Px ∧Qx)
b.
Alternatives: ¬∃x□(Px∧Qx), ¬∃x□(Px∨Qx), ¬∃x□Px, ¬∃x□Qx,
¬∀x□(Px ∧Qx), ¬∀x□(Px ∨Qx), ¬∀x□Px, ¬∀x□Qx
c.
IE alternatives: ¬∃x□(Px ∨Qx), ¬∀x□(Px ∨Qx)
d.
II alternatives: ¬∃x□(Px ∧Qx), ¬∃x□Px, ¬∃x□Qx, ¬∀x□(Px ∧
Qx), ¬∀x□Px, ¬∀x□Qx
The results of applying exh and exh′ to α, with the redundancies removed,
amount to (13a) and (13b), respectively.
(13)
a.
exh

¬∃x□(Px ∧Qx)

exh′
¬∃x□(Px ∧Qx)

⇔¬∃x□(Px ∧Qx) ∧∀x□(Px ∨Qx) ∧
¬∃x□Px ∧¬∃x□Qx
We can see that the attested inferences can be derived with exh′ but not with
exh. More speciﬁcally, there is no way to derive these inferences with exh, but
there is one way to derive them with exh′.8
2
A More Inclusive Inclusion
2.1
Conceptual Motivation for Inclusion
BLF mention a “possible underlying conception” which they say has “guided
[their] thinking”.
(14)
Possible underlying conception (Bar-Lev and Fox 2020, 186)
Exhaustifying p with respect to a set of alternatives C should get us as
close as possible to a cell in the partition induced by C
We quote from (Bar-Lev and Fox 2020, 186): “[...] [T]he goal of [the exhaustivity
operator] is to come as close as possible to an assignment of a truth value to
every alternative, i.e., to a cell in the partition that the set of alternatives induces
7 The assumption that no (¬∃) alternates with not every (¬∀) is based on the
analysis of no which decomposes it into not and some (cf. Zeijlstra 2004; Penka
2011), and on the view about alternative generation according to which negation is
not replaced (cf. Romoli 2012). See Bar-Lev and Fox (2020, 198, note 32) on this
point. Also, see Bar-Lev and Fox (2020, 198–200) for some independent reasons to
assume that □does not alternate with  in this case.
8 BLF point out that recursive application of exh does not help (cf. Bar-Lev and Fox
2020, 196). Note, also, that there is, in addition to the inferences in (10a) and (10b),
another inference derived in (13b), namely ∀x□(Px ∨Qx). This inference is really
optional, since it should only arise if the alternative ¬∀x□(Px ∨Qx) is considered
relevant, which it does not have to be. Again, we consider, for the purpose of this
note, all alternatives to be relevant. (See note 1 and 5.).

Modal Domains and Strengthened Meanings
161
[...] [The exhaustivity operator] is designed such that, when possible, it would
yield a complete answer to the question formed by the set of alternatives. If
this conception is correct, one would think that [it] shouldn’t only exclude, i.e.,
assign false to as many alternatives as possible, but should also include, i.e.,
assign true to as many alternatives as possible once the exclusion is complete”.
Looking at (5) and (9), we can see clearly how this idea plays out. The
proposition expressed by exh(p) consists of ﬁve cells in the partition induced by
the alternatives, while the proposition expressed by exh′(p) consists of three of
these ﬁve cells. Thus, exhautiﬁcation by exh′ gets us closer to a single cell than
exhaustiﬁcation by exh.
2.2
Introducing exh′′
Nothing in the deﬁnitions of innocent exclusion and innocent inclusion rules out
the possibility of alternatives which are neither innocently excludable nor inno-
cently includable. We will call such alternatives the “remaining alternatives”, or
“R alternatives” for short. Now let us entertain the hypothesis in (15), where
AR
p is the set of R alternatives of p and exh′ is as deﬁned in (6b).9
(15)
Hypothesis

The strengthened meaning of p is expressed by exh′′(p)


(16)
Deﬁnition of AR
p
q ∈AR
p iﬀq ∈Ap ∧q ̸∈AIE
p
∧q ̸∈AII
p
The new exhaustivity operator we are considering, exh′′, involves a more “inclu-
sive” inclusion than exh′. Speciﬁcally, exh′′(p) not only includes the II alterna-
tives by assigning true to each of them, but also “includes” the R alternatives by
assigning true to their disjunction. Thus, exh′′(p) is a strengthening of exh′(p),
which means exh′′ actually comes closer to BLF’s “underlying conception” of
exhaustiﬁcation than exh′. We can see this by looking at (17), where the gray
area represents exh′′(p).
9 Note that the condition that AR
p not be empty is signiﬁcant here. We want to capture
the intuition that if there is no R alternative, the system would just output exh′(p).
Speciﬁcally, we do want it to not output the contradiction in case AR
p is empty, which
is what would happen if exh′′(p) were deﬁned as exh′(p) ∧ AR
p .

Comparing (17) to (9), we see that the proposition expressed by exh′(p) consists
of three cells and the proposition expressed by exh′′(p) consists of two of those
three cells. Thus, exh′′(p) is closer to a complete answer of the question formed
by the set of alternatives than exh′(p).
2.3
A Resemblance
Kratzer (1977, 1981, 1991) propose that modality is “double relative”. Speciﬁ-
cally, the quantiﬁcation domain D of a modal operator is speciﬁed in terms of
two sets of propositions, a “modal base” M and an “ordering source” O,10 in
the following way.
(18)
Derivation of D from M and O
a.
Take all maximal sets of propositions from O which can be assigned
true consistently with  M
b.
D is the result of conjoining  M with
(i)
propositions that are in all such sets
(ii)
the disjunction of the remaining propositions in O
A necessity statement □a is then true iﬀa is entailed by D, and a possibility
statement a is true iﬀa is consistent with D.
As we can see, the two steps (18b-i) and (18b-ii) resemble the inclusion of
II and R alternatives, respectively. Thus, if we identify  M with exh(p) and
O with Ap −AIE
p , then we can identify D with exh′′(p). Let us, again, use our
Venn diagram to illustrate. Suppose M = {p, ¬q} and O = {r, s, t}. Then D is
the gray area, which corresponds to exh′′(p). Importantly, D is not the dotted
area, which corresponds to exh′(p).
10 Technically, the two sets of propositions are values of the modal base and the order-
ing source at the evaluation world, as these are functions from worlds to sets of
propositions. The reader is invited to consult Kratzer (1977, 1981, 1991) for a more
precise and sophisticated presentation of her theory. Relevant secondary literature
includes von Fintel and Heim (2011); Frank (1996), among others.

(19)

q
r
s
t
M = {p, ¬q}
O = {r, s, t}
D = p ∧¬q ∧r ∧(s ∨t)
D ̸= p ∧¬q ∧r
We will illustrate with an example. Let us give the following meanings to r,
s, and t.11
(20)
a.
r = John volunteered as poll watcher
b.
s = John voted Republican
c.
t = John voted Democrat
And let it be common ground that p∧¬q.12 This will be the modal base. Suppose
that John’s father says he voted Republican (s), John’s mother says he voted
Democrat (t), and both of John’s parents say he volunteered as poll watcher (r).
This will be the ordering source. Now consider the following sentences.
(21)
a.
In view of what his parents say, it is possible that John volunteered
as poll watcher and voted Republican
(r ∧s)
b.
In view of what his parents say, it is possible that John volunteered
as poll watcher and did not vote
(r ∧¬s ∧¬t)
If D = p∧¬q ∧r, the dotted area, we expect both (21a) and (21b) to be true, as
both r∧s and r∧¬s∧¬t are consistent with p∧¬q∧r. If D = p∧¬q∧r∧(s∨t), the
gray area, we expect (21a) to be true and (21b) to be false, as r ∧s is consistent
with p ∧¬q ∧r ∧(s ∨t) but r ∧¬s ∧¬t is not. Our intuition is that (21a) is true
and (21b) is false. This fact constitutes evidence that D is p ∧¬q ∧r ∧(s ∨t),
the gray area, and not p ∧¬q ∧r, the dotted area.
3
A Conjecture
The Kratzerian inclusion of the ordering source involves including the disjunction
of propositions which are not “innocently includable”. Thus, it resembles the
inclusion step of exh′′, not that of exh′. Our judgement about (21a) and (21b)
conﬁrms that Kratzer is correct.
11 We will assume that one can vote for only one party, and that the only choices are
Republican and Democrat.
12 In other words, let what we know be consistent with r, s, t, r ∧s, r ∧t, and let it
assymetrically entail r ∨s∨t. For concreteness, we can take this body of information
to be the proposition that John lived in D.C and either voted or volunteered as poll
watcher.

164
T. Trinh
What about exh′ and exh′′ themselves? We have seen how they diﬀer for-
mally. Are there cases which distinguish them empirically? Let us look again at
the deﬁnition of exh′′.
(22)
exh′′(p) ⇔def exh′(p) ∧

AR
p ̸= ∅→ AR
p

Logically, exh′(p) and exh′′(p) will be equivalent in two scenarios.
(23)
exh′(p) ⇔exh′′(p) iﬀeither (a) or (b) holds
a.
exh′(p) ⇒ AR
p
b.
AR
p = ∅
Consider (23a) ﬁrst. This scenario is instantiated by plain disjunctions such as
(24).
(24)
John talked to Mary or Sue (p ∨q)
a.
Alternatives: p ∨q, p, q, p ∧q
b.
IE alternatives: p ∧q
c.
II alternatives: p ∨q
d.
R alternatives: p, q
e.
exh′(p ∨q) ⇔(p ∨q) ∧¬(p ∧q)
Now consider (23b). This scenario is exempliﬁed by (10), discussed in Sect. 1.3.
As the reader can see from (12), the IE and II alternatives of (10) exhaust the
set of its alternatives. Thus, there are no R alternatives left.
Another case where every alternative is either IE or II is one involving the
scalar items all, many, some. Consider the three sentences in (25).
(25)
a.
John did all of the homeworks
b.
John did many of the homeworks
c.
John did some of the homeworks
Each of these sentences has all three as alternatives. This means that for (25a),
every alternative is II. For (25b), (25a) is IE while (25b) and (25c) are II. And
for (25c), (25a) and (25b) are IE while (25c) is II.
When will exh′(p) and exh′′(p) not be equivalent? Obviously when both (23a)
and (23b) are false. Has a case been discussed in the literature which exempliﬁes
this possibility? The answer to this question, we believe, is negative. As far as we
know, all cases considered in the literature on exhaustiﬁcation so far, including
those discussed in Bar-Lev and Fox (2017, 2020), are either an instance of (23a)
or an instance of (23b). We conjecture that this holds generally for all cases of
exhaustiﬁcation.
(26)
Strengthened Meaning Conjecture (SMC)
There is no sentence p in natural language such that the strengthened
meaning of p is exh′(p) but not exh′′(p)

Modal Domains and Strengthened Meanings
165
From our discussion in Sects. 2.1 and 2.3, it is clear that the exhaustivity operator
could in principle be exh′′, not exh′, and that the distinction between exh′′ and
exh′ could in principle make an empirical diﬀerence. We could imagine the facts
about semantic strengthening to be such that they adjudicate between the two
diﬀerent inclusion procedures involved in exhaustiﬁcation, just as facts about
modality do with respect to the ordering source. So what is missing? We believe
that SMC will follow given a complete theory of alternatives. In other words, we
believe that such a theory would rule out the scenario in (3) as a grammatical
impossibility. We therefore formulate the following challenge for future research.
(27)
Challenge
Construct the theory of alternatives so that SMC follows

Conclusion
Bar-Lev and Fox (2017, 2020) propose to add inclusion to exhaustiﬁcation. In
addition to providing empirical arguments for their proposal, they also note that
the addition makes conceptual sense given the natural understanding of seman-
tic strengthening as an attempt by the grammar to get as close as possible to a
complete answer to the question formed by the set of alternatives. We discuss a
variant of inclusion which would better represent this attempt than the variant
proposed by Bar-Lev and Fox. We show that the new variant resembles the inclu-
sion of ordering sources in Kratzer’s (1977, 1981, 1991) theory of modality. We
point out that the two variants end up being empirically equivalent for the cases
of strengthened meaning so far considered in the literature. We conjecture that
this equivalence is a general fact about exhaustiﬁcation, and pose the challenge
of deriving it for future research.

Abstract. For a sentence like exactly three boys are between 5 ft 10 in.
and 6 ft tall, why cannot we abstract the height information out and raise
a corresponding degree question like #How tall are exactly three boys?
Inspired by the ideas that (i) there is a connection between wh-questions
(e.g., who did Mary kiss) and deﬁnite descriptions (e.g., the people that
Mary kissed) and (ii) deﬁnite descriptions and modiﬁed numerals (e.g.,
exactly three boys) bring post-suppositions (i.e., delayed evaluations that
lead to relative deﬁniteness, Brasoveanu 2013, Bumford 2017), I propose
that when diﬀerent elements that bring post-suppositions are present,
a potential conﬂict arises in computing relative deﬁniteness, leading to
uninterpretability.

Introduction
This paper aims to explain the unacceptability of sentences like (2b): a con-
stituent question containing a modiﬁed numeral.

a.
Brienne is between 5′10′′ and 6′ tall.
b.
How tall is Brienne?
(2)
a.
Exactly three boys are between 5′10′′ and 6′ tall.
b. #How tall are exactly three boys?
For a sentence like (1a), we can naturally abstract the height information
(the underlined part) out and raise a corresponding degree question on Brienne’s

height (see (1b)). Intriguingly, in contrast to (1), for a sentence like (2a), which
contains a modiﬁed numeral (here exactly three boys), abstracting the height
information out to form a corresponding degree question does not work, yielding
an intuitively unacceptable sentence (see (2b)).
The uninterpretability of constituent questions like (2b) does not seem like an
entirely new observation. Similar unacceptable question phenomena have been
reported in the literature on intervention eﬀects or weak island eﬀects (see,
e.g., Szabolcsi and Zwarts 1993, Szabolcsi 2006, Rullmann 1995, Honcoop 1996,
Beck 1996, 2006, Fox and Hackl 2007, Abrus´an 2014).
As illustrated by the contrast between (3a) and (3b) (i.e., wh-in-situ vs. wh-
movement), intervention eﬀects arise when an intervener (here the negation
expression koi nahiiN ) precedes a wh-word (here kyaa) in a wh-question. This
kind of intervention eﬀects are often attested in wh-in-situ languages (e.g., Hindi,
Korean). Cross-linguistically, typical interveners include, but are not limited to,
focus particles and downward entailing (DE) quantiﬁers (e.g., no, few, at most).

Islands refer to domains which prevent the displacement of items contained
within them, and weak islands are those that are only closed for some kinds
of items, but not all kinds of items (see Szabolcsi 2006, Abrus´an 2014). As
illustrated by (4), negation words or DE quantiﬁers create weak islands eﬀects
in the formation of a degree question (see (4a) and (4c)), how-many question
(see (4b)), or manner question (see (4d)). In contrast, negation words or DE
quantiﬁers do not create islands for the displacement of items like which book
(see (5)). Elements that create weak island eﬀects are also not limited to negation
operators or DE quantiﬁers.

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions
169
Within the existing literature, there are already a variety of proposals on
intervention eﬀects or weak island eﬀects, sometimes with diﬀerent empirical
coverages. The pattern ‘modiﬁed numeral + degree question’ (see (2b)) seems
relevant, but it has not been much studied as a core piece of data. In this paper,
I propose to start with the special property of modiﬁed numerals that they bring
post-suppositions (Brasoveanu 2013) and explore how far this new perspective
can advance our understanding of sentences like (2b) as well as empirical data
related to intervention eﬀects or weak island eﬀects.
In a nutshell, I adopt and develop existing ideas in the literature on wh-
questions: there is a connection between the interpretation of wh-questions
(e.g., who did Mary kiss) and deﬁnite descriptions (e.g., the people that Mary
kissed). Then given that deﬁnite descriptions and modiﬁed numerals are both ele-
ments that bring post-suppositions (see Brasoveanu 2013, Bumford 2017), i.e.,
delayed evaluations that result in a deterministic update with relative deﬁnite-
ness, the presence of both these kinds of items in the same sentence potentially
yields a conﬂict with regard to relative deﬁniteness, leading to uninterpretability.
I will also address how this potential uninterpretability can be circumvented.
In the following, Sect. 2 ﬁrst presents how modiﬁed numerals and deﬁnite
descriptions contribute post-suppositions (Brasoveanu 2013, Bumford 2017).
Section 3 argues for a parallel analysis for interpretable wh-questions and modi-
ﬁed numerals / deﬁnite descriptions. Based on this, Sect. 4 accounts for the unin-
terpretability of the core data under discussion (see (2b)). Section 5 compares
the current proposal with existing approaches developed within the literature on
intervention eﬀects and weak island eﬀects and shows advantages of the current
proposal. Section 6 concludes.

Post-suppositions
2.1
Brasoveanu (2013): Modiﬁed Numerals as Post-suppositions
Modiﬁed numerals bring post-suppositions: their numerical information is
attached to a non-local, sentence-level maximization (Brasoveanu 2013).
The maximization eﬀect of modiﬁed numerals has been widely reported in the
literature (see, e.g., Szabolcsi 1997, Krifka 1999, de Swart 1999, Umbach 2006,
Zhang 2018). As illustrated by the contrast in (6), compared to bare numerals
like two dogs, modiﬁed numerals like at least two dogs exhibit maximality, as
evidenced by the infelicitous continuation perhaps she fed more. In other words,
while the semantic contribution of two in (6a) is existential, at least two in
(6b) conveys the quantity information of the totality of dogs fed by Mary.
(6)
a.
Mary fed two dogs. They are cute. Perhaps she fed more.
b.
Mary fed at least two dogs. They are cute. #Perhaps she fed more.

170
L. Zhang
The non-localness of this maximization is best reﬂected in the cumulative
reading of sentences like (7). (7) has a distributive reading (7a) and a cumulative
reading (7b), and we focus on the cumulative reading (7b) here. (For notation
simplicity, cumulative closure is assumed for lexical relations when needed.)

According to the intuition of native speakers, sentence (7) is true under the
scenario described by Fig. 1, but false under the scenario described by Fig. 2.
It is worth noting that if we adopt the analysis shown in (8), then sentence (7)
should be judged true under the scenario of Fig. 2: there are two such boy-sum
witnesses, namely b2⊕b3⊕b4 and b1⊕b2⊕b4, and for each of these two boy-sums,
(i) their cardinality is 3, and (ii) the maximal sum of movies seen between them
has the cardinality of 5 (m2 ⊕m3 ⊕m4 ⊕m5 ⊕m6 and m1 ⊕m2 ⊕m4 ⊕m5 ⊕m6,
respectively). There are no larger boy-sums such that they saw in total 5 movies
between them. Thus the contrast of intuition (i.e., (7) is true under Fig. 1, but

false under Fig. 2) means that (i) the genuine cumulative reading shown in (7b)
is distinct from the unattested pseudo-cumulative reading shown in (8), and (ii)
there is no scope-taking between the two modiﬁed numerals in (7), exactly 3 boys
and exactly 5 movies (see Brasoveanu 2013, Charlow 2017).

True under the context of Fig. 2 (see b2 ⊕b3 ⊕b4 and b1 ⊕b2 ⊕b4)!
As already pointed out by Krifka (1999), the semantic contribution of both
modiﬁed numerals in (7), exactly 3 boys and exactly 5 movies, should take place
simultaneously, at the sentential level, beyond their hosting DPs themselves:
The problem cases discussed here clearly require a representation in which
NPs are not scoped with respect to each other. Rather, they ask for an
interpretation strategy in which all the NPs in a sentence are somehow
interpreted on a par.
(Krifka 1999)
Given Fig. 1, in interpreting (7), we count the cardinalities of all boys who
saw any movies and all movies seen by any boys, instead of the total cardinalities
of all boys and movies in the domain (here in Fig. 1, it’s 4 boys and 6 movies).
Therefore, the application of maximality operators is subject to more restrictions
(here in our context, not just boys, but boy who saw movies; not just movies,
but movies seen by boys), leading to a relativized maximization eﬀect.
A compositional analysis `a la Bumford (2017) is sketched in (9). Within
dynamic semantics, meaning derivation is considered a series of updates from an
information state to another. The semantic contribution of modiﬁed numerals
is split. They ﬁrst introduce discourse referents (drefs), x and y. Restrictions
like movie(y), boy(x), and saw(x, y) are added onto these drefs. Eventually, it
is after all these restrictions are applied that maximality and cardinality tests,
Mu/Mν/3u/5ν, as delayed evaluations, i.e., post-suppositional tests, come into
force. Mu and Mν check whether u and ν are assigned the mereologically max-
imal plural individuals x and y that satisfy all the restrictions, and 3u and 5ν
check whether the cardinalities of maximal x and y are 3 and 5 respectively.

Bumford (2017): Deﬁnite Descriptions as Post-suppositions
Not only modiﬁed numerals bring post-suppositions, Bumford (2017)’s analysis
for Haddock (1987)’s example (see Fig. 3) shows that deﬁnite descriptions
like the rabbit in the hat also involve post-suppositions, i.e., delayed tests that
lead to relativized deﬁniteness eﬀects.
Under the scenario shown in Fig. 3, there are multiple rabbits (R1, R2, R3)
and multiple hats (H1, H2). Thus, the uniqueness requirement of the rabbit or
the hat cannot be met in an absolute sense. However, the rabbit in the hat is still
perfectly felicitous in this context.
Fig. 3. The rabbit in the hat
Bumford (2017) argues that Haddock (1987)’s deﬁnite description is exactly
parallel to the case of exactly 3 boys saw exactly 5 movies, where maximality
tests are applied on drefs satisfying all these restrictions including movie(y),
boy(x), and saw(x, y), resulting in relativized maximization.
1 The type of Mν is (g →{⟨α, g⟩} ) →(g →{⟨α, g⟩} ), with g meaning the type for
assignment functions, and α standing for the type of the denotation corresponding
to the constituent. The usual notation for types ⟨α, β⟩is written as α →β here.

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions
173
As shown in (10), under the given scenario in Fig. 3, for the rabbit in the hat,
uniqueness tests 1ν/1u are also applied in a delayed, non-local manner, after
the introduction of all the drefs (i.e., x and y) and restrictions (i.e., hat(y),
rabbit(x), and in(x, y)). More speciﬁcally, the test 1ν ﬁrst checks whether there
is a unique hat in the context such that only this hat contains any rabbits. Then
the test 1u checks whether the rabbit contained in the above-mentioned unique
rabbit-containing hat is unique.2

The upshot is that the semantic contribution of modiﬁed numerals and deﬁ-
nite descriptions can be considered split, (i) introducing drefs at an earlier stage,
2 An anonymous reviewer questions about how we can decide the order of diﬀerent
maximality tests and whether the order of maximality tests in the trees of (9) and
(10) indicate scopal relations.
For the order of applying maximality tests in (9) and (10), I basically follow the
original analysis of Brasoveanu (2013) and Bumford (2017).
For (9), according to Brasoveanu (2013), the maximality tests on the two plural
individual drefs need to be applied simultaneously, as delayed tests (i.e., after
the introduction of all relevant drefs and the application of relevant restrictions).
The simultaneous application of the two maximality tests is intended for the non-
scopal cumulative reading (see also Krifka 1999’s discussion, and see Zhang 2022’s
discussion on attributing this simultaneity to contextually relevant QUD).
For (10), I also follow Bumford (2017) in applying the two uniqueness tests one
after the other. In my view, these two uniqueness tests can also be applied simulta-
neously in picking out the unique rabbit-hat pair.
The order of applying maximality tests does have an eﬀect similar to QR-styled
scope-taking, but via a distinct mechanism. A more detailed discussion is beyond
the scope of the current paper (see Charlow 2017).

and (ii) then at a later stage, imposing delayed, post-suppositional tests and
leading to a relativized maximization/deﬁniteness eﬀect.
Moreover, modiﬁed numerals (e.g., exactly 3 boys) are distinct from deﬁnite
descriptions (e.g., the 3 boys) in that the former can only be relatively deﬁnite,
while the latter can be either absolutely or relatively deﬁnite.3
3
A Post-suppositional View on wh-questions
A post-suppositional view on the interpretability of wh-questions can be devel-
oped based on the following existing insights.
First, wh-expressions are parallel to indeﬁnites (as well as other expressions
like proper names, deﬁnite descriptions, modiﬁed numerals, etc.) in introduc-
ing drefs, as evidenced by their parallel behavior in supporting cross-sentential
anaphora (see, e.g., Comorovski 1996). As illustrated in (11), the pronoun
he refers back to the dref introduced by someone/Kevin/the boy/exactly one
boy/who in all these cases. For (11e), the pronoun he can also be considered
referring back to the answer to the question who came? (see Li 2020).
(11)
a.
Someone0 came. I heard that he0 coughed a few times.
b.
Kevin0 came. I heard that he0 coughed a few times.
c.
The0 boy came. I heard that he0 coughed a few times.
d.
Exactly one0 boy came. I heard that he0 coughed a few times.
e.
Who0 came? I heard that he0 coughed a few times.
Second, according to Dayal (1996)’s Maximal Informativity Presupposition,
a question presupposes the existence of a maximally informative true answer.
This idea can be combined with the Hamblin-Karttunen semantics of questions
to reason about the (non-)deterministic updates of propositions.
According to Hamblin (1973), a wh-question denotes a set of propositions,
which are possible propositional answers to the question. Then according
to Karttunen (1977), a wh-question denotes the set of its true propositional
answers. As illustrated in (12), we can use an answerhood operator to bridge the
set of possible answers and the maximally informative true answer. Essentially,
this answerhood operator presupposes the existence of a maximally informative
true answer p and picks out this p from Q, a set of propositions. What this
answerhood operator does is reminiscent of the semantics of deﬁnite determiner
the, which, when deﬁned, contributes deﬁniteness by picking out the unique (e.g.,
the dog) or the mereologically maximal (e.g., the dogs) item (see (10)).
(12)
Ans(Q)(w) =∃p[w ∈p ∈Q ∧∀q[w ∈q ∈Q →p ⊆q]].
ιp[w ∈p ∈Q ∧∀q[w ∈q ∈Q →p ⊆q]]
Dayal (1996)
With the above two ideas combined, an interpretable wh-question can be
analyzed in the same dynamic semantics framework as modiﬁed numerals and
deﬁnite descriptions are analyzed in Sect. 2.
3 I thank an anonymous reviewer for asking me to make this clear.

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions
175
As illustrated in (13) (wh-movement and head movement are omitted in the
tree), who works like someone or the indeﬁnite component of the in introducing
a dref in a non-deterministic way. After all relevant restrictions are added (here
boy(x), kiss(Mary, x)), the silent operator, Ansu, plays the same role as a
maximality operator, bringing a post-suppositional evaluation and checking in
the output information state whether u is assigned the mereologically maximal
plural individual x that satisﬁes boy(x) and kiss(Mary, x). Thus the applica-
tion of Ansu leads to a deterministic update. As far as a wh-question satisﬁes
Dayal (1996)’s Maximal Informativity Presupposition and is thus interpretable,
the derivation involving the application of Ans should not fail.45

A similar analysis can be developed for degree questions, with an answerhood
operator, Scalar-Ansu, which is adjusted for a set of drefs that are scalar values.
(14)
[[tall]]⟨dt,et⟩
def
= λI⟨dt⟩λx.height(x) ⊆I
(Zhang and Ling 2021)
4 In this short paper, I focus on the most basic data of wh-questions (e.g., who did
Mary kiss) and degree questions (e.g., how tall is Brienne). I leave aside for future
work cases like mention-some questions that can have multiple complete true answers
(see (i)) or higher-order reading questions (see (ii) and Xiang 2021).
(i) Where can I buy an Italian newspaper?
(ii) Which books does John have to read?
The French novels or the Russian poems. The choice is up to him.
5 Here I actually implement Dayal (1996)’s Maximal Informativity Presupposition
in a post-suppositional way. As pointed to me by Anna Szabolcsi (p.c.), a post-
supposition that is not satisﬁed in its local domain gets imposed on the non-local
domain like a traditional presupposition (see Brasoveanu and Szabolcsi 2012), so
maybe we could say that all presuppositions start out as post-suppositions. Thus I
believe a post-suppositional version of Dayal (1996)’s presupposition is compatible
with this general picture of presuppositions and worth having a try. A thorough
investigation of this post-suppositional perspective on wh-questions and whether my
current analysis is strictly contingent on this post-suppositional perspective is left
for future work.

I adopt the notion of intervals to represent scalar values (see also
Schwarzschild and Wilkinson 2002, Abrus´an 2014, Zhang and Ling 2021, a.o.).
An interval is a convex set of degrees, e.g., {d | 5′5′′ < d ≤7′1′′}, which can
also be written as (5′5′′, 7′1′′]. As illustrated in (14), a gradable adjective like
tall relates an interval I and an atomic individual x, such that the height mea-
surement of x falls within the interval I along a scale of height. For exam-
ple, the meaning of Brienne is between
5′10′′ and
6′ tall is analyzed as
height(Brienne) ⊆[5′10′′, 6′].
As illustrated in (15), I propose that during base generation, how u non-
deterministically introduces an interval dref, I.6 After relevant restrictions are
added (here height(Brienne) ⊆I), the application of Scalar-Ansu picks
out the most informative interval from a set of possible intervals, leading to a
deterministic update. Under an ideal context, where measurements don’t involve
any errors, this most informative interval would be a singleton set of degrees (i.e.,
the narrowest interval that entails all intervals satisfying relevant restrictions),
containing the precise height measurement of Brienne (e.g., [6′3′′, 6′3′′]).
This post-suppositional view on the interpretability of wh-questions is also
compatible with insights on (i) the cross-linguistic parallelism between wh-
questions and wh-free relatives (Caponigro 2003, 2004, Chierchia and Capon-
igro 2013), and (ii) the categorial approach to wh-questions (see Hausser and
Zaeﬀerer 1979).
6 (i) shows that how is parallel with other wh-expressions in introducing drefs and
supporting cross-sentential anaphora. In (ia), 6 ′3 ′′ is similar to deﬁnite descriptions
or proper names (e.g., Kevin in (11b)) in introducing a deﬁnite scalar value so that
that in the subsequent sentence refers back to it. Obviously, the parallelism between
(ia) and (ib) is similar to that shown in (11).
(i)
a. Brienne is 6′3′′0 tall. It seems that Jaime is a bit shorter than that0.
b. How0 tall is Brienne? It seems that Jaime is a bit shorter than that0.

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions
177
As illustrated in (16), wh-free relatives can be replaced by truth-conditionally
equivalent DPs, and in most cases (except for the complement position of exis-
tential predicates in some languages, see Caponigro 2004), both wh-free rela-
tives and their corresponding DPs exhibit maximality/deﬁniteness.7 Under the
current post-suppositional analysis, the semantics of the free relative in (16a),
[[what Adam cooked]], can be derived by applying the silent maximality opera-
tor Ansu to the meaning of the question what did Adam cook?, which yields the
maximal sum of things, σx.[cook(Adam, x)], i.e., the meaning of the DP the
things Adam cooked (see also Chierchia and Caponigro 2013 for a similar idea).8
(16)
a.
Jie tasted whatu Adam cooked.
(example from Caponigro 2004)
b.
Jie tasted [DP theu things Adam cooked ].
Within the categorial approach to wh-questions (Hausser and Zaeﬀerer 1979),
a wh-question denotes a function, which takes its short answer as argument to
generate a (maximally informative) true proposition, as illustrated in (17).
(17)
Categorial approach: [[who did Mary kiss]] = λx. Mary kissed x
a.
Short answer: Kate and Kevin.
b.
Propositional answer: Mary kissed Kate and Kevin.
Under the current post-suppositional analysis, as illustrated in (18), this func-
tion λx.Mary kissed x is considered a restriction on the dref introduced by the
wh-expression, x. Then the short answer, here Kate and Kevin, can be consid-
ered similar to the cardinality tests in the case of the cumulative-reading sentence
exactly 3 boys saw exactly 5 movies. The test (kate ⊕Kevin)u is attached to the
application of the maximality test Ansu, checking whether σx.kiss(Mary, x) is
equivalent to the sum ‘Kate⊕Kevin’. This amounts to turning a short answer
into a corresponding propositional answer to a wh-question.
7 Wh-free choices corresponding to mention-some wh-questions are also exceptions
(see Chierchia and Caponigro 2013) and don’t seem to exhibit maximality:
(i) Mary looked for who can help her.
= Mary looked for someone that can help her.
̸= Mary looked for all the people that can help her.
8 In addition to wh-free relatives, concealed questions also demonstrate the parallelism
between deﬁnite DPs and wh-questions (see e.g., Nathan 2006):
(i)
a. Jaime knows how tall Brienne is.
b. Jaime knows the height of Brienne.

Essentially, based on Dayal (1996)’s Maximal Informativity Presupposition,
I propose that for an interpretable wh-question, (i) its wh-expression introduces
a dref non-deterministically, and (ii) a delayed, post-supposition-like maximality
operator can bring deﬁniteness to this dref, leading to a deterministic update.

Accounting for Uninterpretable Questions
4.1
Interpreting a Modiﬁed Numeral in a Matrix Degree Question
The interpretation of a declarative degree sentence containing a modiﬁed
numeral (see (2a), repeated here as (19)) is straightforward.

λg. {⟨x, gu→x⟩| boy(x)}
someu

of exactly Nu)
boys
are
Dist [5′10′′, 6′] tall
In this sentence, only exactly three brings post-suppositional tests. As shown
in (19), as post-suppositional tests, Mu picks out the largest boy-sum x such
that for each atomic boy within x, his height falls within the interval [5′10′′, 6′],
and 3u checks whether the cardinality of this boy-sum x is equal to 3.
Then I turn to the core data under discussion, a degree question containing
a modiﬁed numeral (repeated in (20)):
9 Given that [[tall]] relates an interval and an atomic individual (see (14)), I assume a
distributivity operator Dist (
def
= λx.λP⟨et⟩.∀z ⊑atom x[P(z)]) here.

(= (2b))
According to the post-supposition-based analysis addressed in Sects. 2 and
3, in sentence (20), both wh-expression how and modiﬁed numeral exactly three
(boys) ﬁrst introduce a dref, as show in (21):

Once all the drefs are introduced and relevant restrictions are added, there are
two potential derivation orders: either (i) as shown in (22), the maximality and
cardinality tests of exactly 3 are applied ﬁrst, letting the deterministic update
from Scalar-Ausν take place later, or (ii) as shown in (23), the deterministic
update from Scalar-Ausν happens ﬁrst, letting the maximality and cardinality
tests of exactly 3 be checked later.

Suppose we adopt the possibility of (22), then Mu would select out the
absolute largest boy-sum in the given context, and 3u would check whether the
cardinality of this absolute largest boy-sum is 3. If the tests Mu and 3u don’t
fail, the application of Scalar-Ausν would eventually yield the most informative
height interval such that (i) its lower bound is equivalent to the precise height
of the shortest boy in the context, and (ii) its upper bound is equivalent to the
precise height of the tallest boy in the context.
However, given that such a question amounts to requesting the height infor-
mation of the absolute largest boy-sum in the given context, speakers would use
the question how tall are the (three) boys instead. In other words, exactly three
boys, which necessarily involves relative deﬁniteness, would be ruled out in the
competition with the deﬁnite description the (three) boys, which supports the
meaning of absolute deﬁniteness.10
On the other hand, suppose we adopt the possibility of (23), then Scalar-
Ausν would select out the absolute most informative height interval such that it
includes the height of some boy(s). As far as boys are considered not of the same
height, there cannot be a unique most informative height interval (e.g., suppose
the heights of two boys are [5′10′′, 5′10′′] and [6′, 6′], respectively. Then there is
no unique interval I such that I entails, i.e., is a subset of, both [5′10′′, 5′10′′] and
[6′, 6′]). Thus Scalar-Ausν would not fail only if all the boys are considered of
the same height, and when Scalar-Ausν does not fail, Mu would also select out
the absolute largest boy-sum in the given context. Obviously, such a question still
amounts to requesting the height information of the absolute largest boy-sum in
the given context, and exactly three boys would be ruled out in the competition
with the (three) boys.
Overall, the interpretation of (20) would be problematic because both Mu
and Scalar-Ausν need to be checked to result in relative deﬁniteness, i.e., both
wait to be applied as the last post-suppositional test in the derivation. In other
words, without resolving the update of u, Scalar-Ausν cannot work to yield
the most informative height interval for u, but without resolving the update
of ν, Mu cannot work to pick out the relatively maximal boy-sum. Obviously,
the requirements of Mu and Scalar-Ausν cannot be both satisﬁed, and the
unacceptability of the whole sentence thus arises.
10 An anonymous reviewer asks whether this competition view would weaken the analy-
sis, as it implies that the relative deﬁniteness of how and modiﬁed numerals in #How
tall are exactly three boys CAN be satisﬁed. In Sect. 4.2, I show that sometimes these
post-suppositions that impose relative deﬁniteness indeed can all be satisﬁed.

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions

4.2
Interpreting a Modiﬁed Numeral in an Embedded Degree
Question
As illustrated by (24), in comparative sentences, their than-clause can be con-
sidered parallel to a degree question (see Fleisher 2020, Zhang 2020).
(24)
Brienne is taller than Jaime is tall.
[[than Jaime is]] ⇝addressing a degree question: how tall is Jaime?
According to Zhang and Ling (2021), a comparative sentence basically means
that the scalar value associated with the subject minus the scalar value asso-
ciated with the comparative standard results in a positive diﬀerence (i.e., an
increase). As shown in (25), comparative morpheme -er is considered denot-
ing a default positive diﬀerence, i.e., an increase. The than-clause, i.e., than
Jaime is tall in (24), denotes the short answer to the degree question how tall is
Jaime and amounts to the most informative interval I′ satisfying the restriction
height(Jaime) ⊆I′, written as ιI′[height(Jaime) ⊆I′] here. Eventually, as
shown in (25d), this short answer to the degree question how tall Jaime is plays
the role of comparative standard in the derivation of sentential meaning.

Intriguingly, although the matrix degree question #how tall are exactly three
boys (see (2b)/(20)) is uninterpretable, comparative sentence (26), which con-
tains a than-clause corresponding to the problematic degree question, is good.
(26)
Mary is taller thanν exactly threeu boys are tall.
I have proposed an analysis for (26) in Zhang (2020). As mentioned in
Sect. 4.1, for the matrix degree question #how ν tall are exactly three u boys,
Scalar-Ausν and Mu, both tests that bring relative deﬁniteness, require to be
applied as the last test, and both requirements cannot be satisﬁed at the same
time.
For (26), however, information outside the than-clause contributes to resolve
the deterministic update of ν independent of the update of u.
As mentioned above (see (25c)), the semantics of a comparative addresses the
relation among three deﬁnite scalar values: (i) the scalar value associated with
the subject, which serves as the minuend; (ii) the scalar value associated with
the than-clause, which serves as the subtrahend; and (iii) the diﬀerence between

182
L. Zhang
the minuend and the subtrahend. Given the subtraction relation between these
three deﬁnite values (see (25c)), we can use two of the three values to reason
about the third one.
Thus, for (26), given the minuend (i.e., height(Mary)) and the diﬀerence
(i.e., (0, +∞)), the deterministic update of ν (i.e., the value of the subtrahend)
can be settled ﬁrst: it is the largest interval below height(Mary), which can be
written as (−∞, the precise height measurement of Mary).11 This update of ν
satisﬁes relative deﬁniteness in the sense that it is checked at the sentence-level,
beyond the than-clause itself, as a delayed test after more restrictions are added
(i.e., μ is assigned to an interval dref I satisfying ‘I is below height(Mary)’).
Then similar to the case of (19), Mu is applied to pick out the largest
boy-sum x such that ∀z
⊑atom
x[height(z)
⊆
(−∞, the precise height
measurement of Mary)], and 3ν is applied to check whether the cardinality of x
is 3. Therefore, through the derivation of the meaning of (26), the relative maxi-
mality of exactly three boys is achieved.
It is worth noting that for this x, the interval (−∞, the precise height of Mary)
can still be the most informative short answer to the degree question how tall is x
(i.e., with Scalar-Auxν applied to how tall is x). Imagine an extreme case: one of
the boys in x is just slightly shorter than Mary is, and another one of the boys in
x is extremely short. Then the application of Scalar-Auxν would lead to exactly
this interval (−∞, the precise height of Mary). In other words, the above analysis
of (26) is not incompatible with the view that the than-clause addresses the short
answer to a corresponding degree question. It’s just that in this case, the informa-
tion of this short answer (i.e., (−∞, the precise height of Mary)) is derived ﬁrst,
and then this deﬁnite interval is made use of in checking the post-suppositional
requirements of the modiﬁed numeral here (i.e., exactly three boys).
5
Discussion
In Sect. 4, I have shown that the uninterpretability of the pattern ‘modiﬁed
numeral + degree question’ is essentially due to a conﬂict between diﬀerent
items that bring post-suppositions (i.e., both need to be applied as the last test
to result in relative deﬁniteness) and how this conﬂict can be circumvented (i.e.,
additional information is available to resolve the deﬁniteness of one of the items
and thus remove the conﬂict). Here I compare the current proposal with three
existing lines of research on intervention eﬀects or weak island eﬀects.
5.1
Intervention Eﬀects: Beck (2006) and Li and Law (2016)
Both Beck (2006) and Li and Law (2016) address intervention eﬀects related to
focus, but their empirical coverages are diﬀerent. As shown in (27) and (28),
their analyses target diﬀerent problematic conﬁgurations.
11 In our actual world, the height of a person cannot be a negative value. This should be
considered a physical constraint in our world knowledge, not a linguistic constraint.
Linguistically, we can imagine characters with a negative height in fantasy works.

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions
183
(27)
The problematic conﬁguration analyzed by Beck (2006):
?* [Q...[focus-sensitive operator [YP. . . WH...]]]
(28)
The problematic conﬁguration analyzed by Li and Law (2016):
?*
[...focus-sensitive operator [ focus alternatives...ordinary alternatives...]]
(or ?* [...focus-sensitive operator [ XPF ...WH...]] )
Beck (2006) is based on Rooth (1985)’s focus semantics. A wh-expression has
its focus semantic value (i.e., a set of alternatives), but lacks an ordinary semantic
value. A Q operator is needed to turn the focus semantic value of a wh-expression
into an ordinary semantic value. However, in the problematic conﬁguration in
(27), (i) a focus-sensitive operator blocks the association between the Q operator
and the wh-expression, and moreover, (ii) the focus-sensitive operator needs to
be applied on an item that has both a focus semantic value and an ordinary
value, which the wh-expression lacks. Thus the derivation crashes.
According to Li and Law (2016), given that both XPF and WH introduce
alternatives, embedding WH within the scope of XPF makes [[[XPF ...WH...]]] a
set of sets of alternatives, which becomes an illicit input for the focus-sensitive
operator, resulting in a derivation crash.
Both Beck (2006) and Li and Law (2016) explain the uninterpretability of
intervention patterns as derivation crash. Diﬀerent from these approaches, the
current account for the uninterpretability of the pattern ‘modiﬁed numeral +
degree question’ is based on a potential failure of achieving relative deﬁniteness.
As shown in Sect. 4, for the pattern ‘modiﬁed numeral + degree question’, the
potential failure of achieving relative deﬁniteness exists for matrix degree ques-
tions, but not for embedded degree questions (i.e., than-clauses of comparatives).
Thus empirically, the current account works better than existing approaches that
explain uninterpretability as derivation crash.
It is worth investigating whether/how the current approach can be further
extended to cover the data of intervention eﬀects. As shown in (29), the matrix
wh-question (29a) is problematic. Indeed, it has a problematic conﬁguration in
both the theories of Beck (2006) and Li and Law (2016). However, once this
conﬁguration is embedded in a wh-conditional, as shown in (29b), there is no
longer uninterpretability. The acceptability contrast between (29a) and (29b)
suggests that the problem of (29a) might not be due to a derivation crash.

Actually, the case of (29b) seems similar to embedded degree questions with
a modiﬁed numeral (see (26) in Sect. 4.2). For (29b), suppose both the wh-item
(i.e., sh´enme) and the focused part (i.e., zhˇıyˇou Mary ‘only Mary’) introduce
drefs ﬁrst and bring post-suppositional tests later. Then within a wh-conditional,
the deterministic update of the wh-expression can be resolved independent of the
focused part, helping to circumvent the issue of which post-suppositional test
needs to be applied the last. I leave the details of this analysis for future work.
5.2
Abrus´an (2014)’s analysis of weak island eﬀects
As mentioned in Sect. 1, the uninterpretable pattern addressed in this paper, i.e.,
‘modiﬁed numeral + degree question’, is also reminiscent of weak island eﬀects.
However, the diﬀerence between (30) and (31) shows that the uninterpretable
pattern under discussion (see (31a)) is still somewhat distinct from typical weak
island eﬀects (see (30a)).
In particular, weak island eﬀects are observed for both matrix and embedded
degree questions (see the parallelism between (30a) and (30b)), while the major
pattern addressed in this paper only leads to uninterpretable matrix degree ques-
tions, but not to uninterpretable embedded degree questions (see the contrast
between (31a) and (31b) and the discussion in Sect. 4.2).
The contrast between embedded degree questions in (30b) and (31b) is likely
due to a further requirement of degree questions: the request of height informa-
tion brings an existential presupposition for items undergoing height measure-
ment – here only exactly 3 boys, but not few boys, guarantees that this existential
presupposition be satisﬁed (see also Zhang 2020 for more discussion).
On the other hand, as illustrated in (30)-(31), it seems that DE quantiﬁers
and modiﬁed numerals do not lead to uninterpretability in wh-questions that
are not degree questions (see (30c) and (31c)).
Presumably, the contrast between (31a) and (31c) is parallel with the contrast
between (30a) and (30c) and thus can be explained by an extension of accounts
that aim to account for weak island eﬀects. For the contrast between (31a) and
(31c), a detailed analysis along this line is left for future work.12

12 I thank an anonymous reviewer for bringing up this issue, i.e., the contrast between
(31a) and (31c).

Post-suppositions and Uninterpretable Questions
185
Among existing studies on weak island eﬀects, Abrus´an (2014)’s account is
also based on the idea that an interpretable wh-question needs to meet Dayal
(1996)’s Maximal Informativity Presupposition. As illustrated in (4a) (repeated
here in (32)), since there does not exist a maximally informative interval I such
that ¬height(John) ⊆I, (32) does not meet the presuppositional requirement,
leading to uninterpretability.
(32)
#How tall isn’t John?
(= (4a))
The current analysis is essentially in the same spirit as Abrus´an (2014).
Although Abrus´an (2014) focuses on weak island eﬀects, she raises the issue of
how intervention eﬀects and weak island eﬀects can be connected. As addressed
in Sect. 5.1, the current analysis has the potential of explaining intervention
eﬀects as well. It is also worth investigating whether the current analysis can
eventually be extended to bridge between the phenomena of intervention eﬀects
and those of weak island eﬀects.
6
Conclusion
In this paper, I have adopted a dynamic semantics perspective to explain why
a degree question like #how tall are exactly three boys? is unacceptable. The
account crucially relies on the ideas that (i) both wh-items (e.g., how) and
modiﬁed numerals (e.g., exactly three boys) introduce drefs and bring post-
suppositonal tests that result in relative deﬁniteness, and (ii) when diﬀerent
post-suppositional tests are present, and their relative deﬁniteness cannot be all
achieved, uninterpretability arises.
Presumably, the current account will bring new insights on more empirical
phenomena, in particular, intervention eﬀects and weak island eﬀects. How the
current account will inﬂuence our understanding on the scope-taking issue within
a wh-question is also left for future research.
