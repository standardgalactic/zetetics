Abstract 
Background:  Xylem, the most abundant tissue on Earth, is responsible for lateral 
growth in plants. Typical xylem has a radial system composed of ray parenchyma cells 
and an axial system of fusiform cells. In most angiosperms, fusiform cells comprise ves‑
sel elements for water transportation and libriform fibers for mechanical support, while 
both functions are performed by tracheids in other vascular plants such as gymno‑
sperms. Little is known about the developmental programs and evolutionary relation‑
ships of these xylem cell types.
Results:  Through both single-cell and laser capture microdissection transcriptomic 
profiling, we determine the developmental lineages of ray and fusiform cells in stem-
differentiating xylem across four divergent woody angiosperms. Based on cross-species 
analyses of single-cell clusters and overlapping trajectories, we reveal highly con‑
served ray, yet variable fusiform, lineages across angiosperms. Core eudicots Populus 
trichocarpa and Eucalyptus grandis share nearly identical fusiform lineages, whereas 
the more basal angiosperm Liriodendron chinense has a fusiform lineage distinct from 
that in core eudicots. The tracheids in the basal eudicot Trochodendron aralioides, an 
evolutionarily reversed trait, exhibit strong transcriptomic similarity to vessel elements 
rather than libriform fibers.
Conclusions:  This evo-devo framework provides a comprehensive understanding 
of the formation of xylem cell lineages across multiple plant species spanning over a 
hundred million years of evolutionary history.

Background
Plant development involves apical and lateral growth. Apical growth elongates the main 
plant axes [1] by growing upward from shoot apical meristem (SAM) and downward 
through root apical meristem (RAM) [2]. Extensive studies have revealed the develop-
mental processes of apical growth [3–5]. The division of a single stem cell type in SAM

provides a continuous source of daughter cells for organogenetic differentiation horizon-
tally into leaves or flowers and basally into stems, vascular cambium and vascular tissues 
[3, 4]. In RAM, different stem cell types produce their own daughter cells with distinct 
cell fates [2, 5]. Lateral growth, which thickens the plant body, is bifacial in nature with 
a single layer of stem cells/initial cells in vascular cambium growing inward into xylem 
and outward into phloem [1, 6–8].
The pluripotency of all stem cells from SAM, RAM, and vascular cambium are con-
stantly maintained by organizer cells [2, 8–13]. The organizer cells are surrounded by 
stem cells in RAM [5], but located at the interface of stem cells and vascular tissue in 
SAM and vascular cambium [1, 4]. In SAM, organizer cells are generated from basal 
division of stem cells and then differentiate into vascular tissue [4]. Recent studies in 
Arabidopsis started to reveal the mechanisms behind stem cell proliferation in vascular 
cambium and differentiation into xylem [6–8, 14]. In vascular cambium, organizer cells 
are derived from periclinal division of stem cells and differentiate into xylem [1, 8]. The 
transcription factor (TF) CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP 
III) promotes xylem identity and cellular quiescence in organizer cells [8], and VNS TFs 
(VND-, NST/SND-, SMB-related proteins) then induce xylem cell terminal differentia-
tion along with programmed cell death [15–17].
The developmental trajectories of apical roots and shoots have been explored at high 
resolution using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) [18–30]. The spatial and tem-
poral distribution of individual cells from different stages revealed highly heterogeneous 
transcriptomes of cell lineages from cell proliferation, identity determination to differ-
entiation. Previous scRNA-seq analyses have focused on plant apical growth in leaves 
[24, 29], flowers [25], shoot tips [27], and roots [18–23, 28, 30], leaving stems the least 
studied organ with high-resolution profiling methods. Such organ-level protoplast isola-
tion, a prerequisite for single-cell analyses, has been mainly performed using herbaceous 
plants, mostly Arabidopsis, which tends to yield limited numbers of vascular tissue cells 
due to the relatively small proportion of vascular tissue in the four organs mentioned 
above [18–30]. The identified xylem cells in previous scRNA-seq analyses of herbaceous 
plants were only within the range of 72 to 1205 cells, which would be insufficient for 
better understanding the cell lineages in xylem development. In addition, Arabidopsis 
lacks ray parenchyma cells under normal growth conditions [31–33] and has immature 
fiber development without complete programmed cell death [34, 35]. These limitations 
of herbaceous plants underscore the need for woody plants in a comprehensive study of 
xylem development.
The stem-differentiating xylem (SDX) of woody plants comprises axial and radial sys-
tems that develop from two types of initials in vascular cambium [36]. Fusiform initials 
differentiate into the axial system, which consists of vessel elements and libriform fib-
ers in most angiosperms and tracheids in gymnosperms and other vascular plants. The 
radial system contains ray parenchyma cells from ray initials. Together these xylem cells 
make up the vast majority of mass in woods and are the most abundant tissue on Earth 
[37]. Over the past hundred years, the development of individual xylem cell types has 
mostly been studied through anatomical observations, leaving the molecular mecha-
nisms behind their differentiation still largely unknown. In this study, we aim to unravel 
the developmental processes of plant xylem through scRNA-seq analyses of four woody

species representing evolutionary divergent angiosperms. To ensure the yield of xylem 
single cells, we adapted our established protocol for collecting SDX protoplasts from 
debarked stems of Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood) [38, 39]. Comparing to pre-
vious organ-level scRNA-seq studies, our method exerts tissue-level cell isolation for a 
better resolution to explore the developmental paths of xylem cells. The other three spe-
cies include another core eudicot Eucalyptus grandis, the basal eudicot Trochodendron 
aralioides, and the magnoliid Liriodendron chinense. These selected species encompass 
the known xylem cell types, including tracheids, vessel elements, libriform fibers, and 
ray parenchyma cells, allowing us to comprehensively explore xylem development in an 
evolutionary context.
Results
Single‑cell and microdissection RNA sequencing reveal SDX cell identities
We profiled the transcriptomes of 25,166 individual SDX cells from 7 biological repli-
cates of P. trichocarpa using two different platforms, 10x Genomics Chromium technol-
ogy and massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq2.0 (MARS-seq2.0) (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S1). The identified xylem cell numbers are around 10 to 500 folds higher than those in 
previous studies on herbaceous plants (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Using first batch of 10x 
scRNA-seq results with 4705 cells (Fig. 1A), unsupervised K-means clustering divides 
the cells into 10 clusters Ptr1 to Ptr10 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A), which are visualized 
using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (Fig. 1B). Current defi-
nitions of SDX cell types are mainly based on anatomical observations [36, 40], and no 
suitable marker genes are available for assigning cell types to the scRNA-seq cell clus-
ters. To correlate morphology and transcriptomes, we established strategies of laser cap-
ture microdissection (LCM) coupled with RNA sequencing (lcmRNA-seq) for three cell 
(See figure on next page.)

types. Transverse sections were used to collect libriform fibers (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S4), with the laser cutting pathways avoiding vessel elements and ray parenchyma cells 
(red area in Fig. 1C–E, and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). Tangential sections were used for 
collecting vessel elements and ray parenchyma cells (Fig. 1G–I, K–M, Additional file 1: 
Fig. S4, S6). For vessel elements, we only cut the cells with obvious and intact pitted 
cell wall (blue area in Fig. 1G–I and Additional file 1: Fig. S6A–C). For ray parenchyma 
cells, we only collected cells located at the center of each tangential section (pink area in 
Fig. 1K–M, and Additional file 1: Fig. S6D–H), avoiding ray parenchyma cells on both 
sides that could not be easily separated from neighbor cells (Fig. 1K–M).
To identify the cell types of the scRNA-seq cell clusters, we examined the transcrip-
tomic correlation between each cell cluster from scRNA-seq and each cell type from 
Fig. 1.  (See legend on previous page.)

lcmRNA-seq. The cell clusters Ptr7 (red), Ptr1 (blue), and Ptr8 (pink) show the highest 
correlation to libriform fibers, vessel elements, and ray parenchyma cells, respectively 
(Fig. 1F, J, N, Additional file 1: Fig. S7). We also found the highest numbers of differ-
entially expressed genes (DEGs) upregulated in both transcriptomes of these cell clus-
ters and their corresponding lcmRNA-seq cell type transcriptomes (scUPlcmUP genes) 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S8).
We found that the scUPlcmUP genes of libriform fibers (Ptr7) are heavily enriched 
with secondary cell wall (SCW) biosynthesis genes, especially those for monolignol bio-
synthesis (Additional file 1: Fig. S9A–N, S10, Additional file 2). Ray parenchyma cells 
(Ptr8) also have moderate expression of monolignol biosynthesis genes (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S10, Additional file 2), consistent with previous observations that ray paren-
chyma cells in Picea also contribute to lignification [41]. Vessel elements barely express 
monolignol biosynthesis genes (Additional file 1: Fig. S10, Additional file 2), support-
ing the good-neighbor or post-mortem hypothesis [42, 43] that the lignification of ves-
sel elements is non-cell-autonomous. The exclusive expression of previously reported 
libriform fiber marker genes, IRX15-L (PdDUF579-9) and ASPARTIC PROTEASE 66 
(PtAP66) [44], in the libriform fiber cell cluster (Ptr7) provide further evidence for the 
cell type annotation (Additional file 1: Fig. S11). Expansins are the proteins that loosen 
cell wall to promote cell expansion [45, 46], and their most highly expressed gene, 
Potri.001G240900 (Additional file 1: Fig. S12), is significantly enriched in vessel elements 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S9O). The highest expansin transcript abundance would facilitate 
the enormous requirement for radial cell wall expansion of vessel elements, the cells 
with the widest cell lumen among three cell types. Furthermore, we found many pho-
tosynthesis-related genes among the scUPlcmUP genes in ray parenchyma cells (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S9P–W), which agrees with previous observations that ray parenchyma 
cells possess chlorophyll-containing plastids to carry out woody tissue photosynthesis 
[47–50]. Since the terminal stage of xylem cell differentiation represents the dead xylem 
cells, it would be impossible to profile the transcriptome of “mature” xylem cells. The 
annotated libriform fibers, vessel elements, and ray parenchyma cells represent the cells 
with determined cell types and under differentiation toward the mature stage. By inte-
grating scRNA-seq–lcmRNA-seq correlation, scUPlcmUP gene distribution and known 
gene functions, we revealed the transcriptomic profiles and single-cell clusters of vessel 
elements (Ptr1), libriform fibers (Ptr7), and ray parenchyma cells (Ptr8).
Two distinct lineages of fusiform and ray cell differentiation from organizer cells
The three cell types Ptr1/7/8 at cell-type determined stages were annotated (Fig. 1B), 
while the rest of the cell clusters remained unidentified (Fig. 1B). All stem cells from 
SAM, RAM, and vascular cambium are constantly maintained by the organizer cells [2, 
14]. Among the HD-ZIP III TFs in Arabidopsis, AtHB8 is sufficient to induce the func-
tion of organizer cells derived from vascular cambium to determine xylem identity [8], 
and HD-ZIP III was reported to participate in interfascicular cambium development in 
Populus [51]. The homologous genes of AtHB8 in P. trichocarpa were mainly expressed 
in Ptr3 and Ptr6 (Fig. 1O, Additional file 1: Fig. S13A). Since organizer cells were found 
to locate right next to vascular cambium [8], organizer cells are supposed to be the cells 
with least differentiating level in the cells isolated from debarked stems. Ptr3 and Ptr6

locate at the farthest position of differentiating libriform fibers/vessel elements/ray 
parenchyma cells, suggesting the identity of Ptr3 and Ptr6 as organizer cells. During pro-
toplast isolation, the tree bark was peeled off from the stems and removed. The breakage 
happened in the area between SDX and cambium [38]. Namely, phloem and initials were 
on the bark side, and organizer cells and SDX remained on the surface of the stems. We 
detected none or extremely low expression of ANT (a stem cell/initial cell marker gene 
[34]; Fig. 1P, Additional file 1: Fig. S13B) or PEAR1 (a phloem marker gene [34]; Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S13C) in any of the cell clusters, as expected from the removal of ini-
tials and phloem during the debarking step of protoplast preparation [38] (Fig. 1A). The 
results led to a highly possible developing path as initials differentiating into organizer 
cells then into xylem cells, and the position of organizer cells, between stem cells/initials, 
and xylem cells (Fig. 1S), is similar to that in SAM and vascular cambium [2, 14].
Intensive cell wall deposition is a critical indication of xylem development. In other 
words, xylem development involves a process of thin-wall cells turning into thick-wall 
cells. We selected the gene sets from the GO terms for cell wall, cellulose and hemicellu-
lose, and plotted the transcript abundance of these gene sets on the UMAP (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S14A, S14B). The results showed an increasing enrichment of transcript abun-
dance toward libriform fibers and vessel elements (Additional file 1: Fig. S14A, S14B). 
Organizer cells are derived directly from vascular meristem. We also extracted the gene 
sets of GO term as meristem, and their transcript abundances were highly enriched in 
both organizer cell clusters (Additional file 1: Fig. S14C). The enriched transcript abun-
dance in the gene sets of meristem in organizer cells indicated the “start” of the cell 
lineage on the UMAP, and the transcript abundance in the gene sets of cell wall genes 
increased toward libriform fibers and vessel elements showing “start to end” on the lin-
eage. A time-course transcriptomic analysis on horizontal growth was performed in a 
previous study using a series of 20-μm tangential sections across the cambial and SDX 
regions [52]. We compared our results to the marker genes identified in the previous 
study and found many genes with consistent expression pattern throughout SDX devel-
opment (Additional file 1: Fig. S14D, S14E). Thus, the relative transcript abundance of 
the genes in the GO terms (cell wall and meristem) (Additional file 1: Fig. S14A, S14B, 
S14C) and the series sections across cambial/SDX regions (Additional file 1: Fig. S14D, 
S14E) both provide additional layers of time-course evidences for our cell lineages.
The transcript abundance of the respective upregulated DEGs of vessel elements (Ptr1) 
and ray parenchyma cells (Ptr8) (Additional file 1: Fig. S15, S16) further resolved the 
cell clusters into two cell lineages based on their differential enrichment. Namely, since 
vessel elements and ray parenchyma cells belong to fusiform and ray lineages, respec-
tively, the expressing patterns of the upregulated genes in each cell type would indicate 
their lineages (Additional file  1: Fig. S15, S16). The sequence Ptr6-Ptr4-Ptr2-Ptr1 is 
the developmental path from fusiform organizer (Ptr6) through fusiform early precur-
sor (Ptr4) and fusiform intermediate precursor (Ptr2) to vessel elements (Ptr1). VND6 
members in the VNS family, the master regulators of vessel element differentiation 
[15], and the expansin gene (Potri.001G240900) are also expressed in this fusiform cell 
lineage (Fig. 1Q, Additional file 1: Fig. S13D, S13F, S15A). In addition, two paralogous 
MYB transcription factors in poplar, PdMYB156 and PdMYB221, were reported as criti-
cal regulators on the development of vessel elements and libriform fibers [53, 54]. The 

Page 7 of 37

in situ hybridization results showed that these two MYBs were highly expressed in both 
vessel elements and libriform fibers [53]. In our scRNA-seq results, the homologous 
genes of these two MYBs in P. trichocarpa showed enriched transcript abundances in 
the fusiform lineages (Additional file 1: Fig. S17A, S17B). The enriched transcript abun-
dance of upregulated genes and known regulators both support our proposed fusiform 
lineages. The cell clusters Ptr3 (ray organizer), Ptr5 (ray precursor), and Ptr8 (ray paren-
chyma) form the other cell lineage (Fig. 1B, R, Additional file 1: Fig. S13E, S15B), which 
is derived from ray initials. The nomenclature of each cell cluster basically represents 
three groups of cells: (i) cells of such cell type, (ii) cells under the differentiation toward 
such cell type, (iii) cells under the differentiation away from such cell type. For exam-
ple, Ptr6 as fusiform organizer cells would contain three groups of cells: the organizer 
cells, the cells under the differentiation from initials into fusiform organizer cells, and 
the organizer cells already under differentiation toward differentiating xylem. Cell differ-
entiation is a continuous process, and cell clustering methods divide cells into discrete 
clusters based on their transcriptomic profiles. The nomenclature of cell clusters in this 
study represents our working hypothesis for SDX developmental paths (fusiform line-
age: Ptr6-Ptr4-Ptr2-Ptr1; ray lineage: Ptr3-Ptr5-Ptr8) and was adopted to facilitate our 
discussion of the cell clusters. Our working hypothesis from scRNA-seq results was also 
supported by the in situ hybridization results from previous studies [44, 53], including 
ESK1a for libriform fibers (Additional file 1: Fig. S17C), ABR1 for organizer cell location 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S17D), and PdMYB156/221 for fusiform lineage (Additional file 1: 
Fig. S17A, S17B).
We notice that fusiform and ray lineages converge at fusiform early precursors (Ptr4) 
and ray precursors (Ptr5) before entering the cell-type determined stages (Fig. 1B). To 
validate this observation, we applied another cell clustering and dimensionality reduc-
tion pipeline MetaCell [55], which similarly showed that these two cell lineages merged 
together at the middle stage of differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S18). Among all 
pairwise comparisons of cell cluster transcriptomic profiles, the pair Ptr4-Ptr5 also has 
very high correlation (Additional file 1: Fig. S19). This striking transcriptomic similar-
ity between fusiform early precursors and ray precursors suggests that fusiform and ray 
cells would differentiate into a similar state before continuing their unique developmen-
tal pathways.
In summary, we uncovered the detailed cell lineages in P. trichocarpa SDX (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S20). Through the clustering of single-cell transcriptomic profiles and identi-
fication of different cell types, we provided novel marker genes (Additional file 3) with 
expression specific to each cell type (Additional file 1: Fig. S21, S22). Using a conserved 
developmental mechanism involving stem cells and organizer cells comparable to those 
in SAM and RAM, xylem fusiform and ray cells exert their differentiation through two 
distinct trajectories.
Highly similar transcriptomes among SDX in different internodes
We performed bulk RNA-seq for stem xylem from different internodes, and anatomical 
analyses were also performed for the examination of xylem developmental stages in P. 
trichocarpa (Additional file 1: Fig. S23). Our anatomical analyses found primary growth 
(bundle vasculature) above 4th internode (from the top), transition zone between 4th 

Page 8 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
and 5th internodes, and secondary growth below 5th internode (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S23A, S23B). The stems used for protoplast isolation in P. trichocarpa were below 12th 
internodes to ensure the xylem materials were all from secondary xylem. We collected 
the xylem samples from five sections of internodes to represent different developmental 
stages of in secondary xylem (Additional file 1: Fig. S23A). Sections 1 to 5 include 6th to 
9th, 10th to 13th, 14th to 17th, 18th to 21st and 26th to 29th internodes, respectively. 
Six biological replicates were used for the xylem in every section for bulk RNA-seq. In 
the principal component analysis (PCA) results, the low percentage of PC1 suggests the 
absence of a dominant factor to differentiate the samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S23C), 
which demonstrated that the percentage of the variation across different developmental 
internodes is subtle. Very few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, with 
only 12, 6, 11, 11, and 18 DEGs from sections 1 to 5, respectively (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S23C). Many of these DEG functions are unknown, and the rest of the annotated DEG 
functions are basically unrelated to xylem development (Additional file 4). Given that 
these DEGs only correspond to less than 0.1% of all expressed 23,441 genes in second-
ary xylem of these five sections (Additional file 1: Fig. S23C), the transcriptomic pro-
files from different internodes are nearly identical. These results suggested that xylem 
development is highly similar in different internodes with secondary growth and that the 
developmental lineages discovered in our single-cell datasets are representative of the 
overall stem-differentiating xylem developmental trajectories.
Identifying SDX cell types across angiosperms
To further explore evolutionary conservation and divergence of SDX development in 
angiosperms, we performed scRNA-seq of SDX cells in three additional woody species, 
including E. grandis, T. aralioides (wheel tree), and L. chinense (Chinese tulip poplar). 
E. grandis also belongs to the same evolutionary clade as P. trichocarpa in core eudicots 
and may possess similar xylem characteristics. L. chinense resides in magnoliids as an 
early diverging lineage, which allows the investigation of xylem development under a 
larger evolutionary scale. In contrast to the vast majority of flowering plants, T. aral-
ioides possesses tracheids instead of vessel elements and libriform fibers, which is a rare 
trait reversal during angiosperm evolution (Fig. 2A) [56, 57]. L. chinense protoplasts were 
sequenced using the 10x Genomics platform as for P. trichocarpa. Samples from E. gran-
dis and field-collected T. aralioides were replete with cellular debris, which prompted us 
to adopt fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled with the plate-based MARS-seq2.0 
protocol to sequence transcriptomes of single sorted protoplasts with minimal debris 
contamination. We obtained the transcriptomic profiles from 5494 (E. grandis), 1993 (T. 
aralioides) and 2977 (L. chinense) individual SDX cells, respectively, which were grouped 
into 10 cell clusters in each species. (Fig. 2B–D, Additional file 1: Fig. S3). The DEGs of 
each cell cluster in the three species were then identified (Additional file 5–7).
Cross-species pairwise correlation analysis of transcriptomic profiles was performed 
to compare the major cell clusters of E. grandis, T. aralioides, and L. chinense to those 
of P. trichocarpa (Fig. 2E–G). Overall, the correlations between P. trichocarpa and E. 
grandis or T. aralioides are higher than those between P. trichocarpa and L. chinense 
(Fig. 2E–G), reflecting the closer phylogenetic relationships among the three eudicots

SDX cell types in L. chinense are anatomically the same as in P. trichocarpa [58] (Fig. 2A), 
two scenarios might explain their low transcriptomic correlation. First, most expressed 
genes are not related to the developmental paths and show low correlations. The SDX

cell differentiation might be regulated by only a few key regulatory genes. Although most 
of gene expressions showed low correlations, the organizer cells can still develop into the 
same cell types under the control of these key regulators. Second, the cell types are actu-
ally of different developmental origins but share similar morphology due to convergent 
evolution.
We were able to identify representative cell clusters in E. grandis corresponding to dif-
ferent cell clusters in P. trichocarpa. Egr5, Egr7, and Egr8 correspond to the fusiform 
early precursors (Ptr4), libriform fibers (Ptr7), and ray parenchyma (Ptr8) cell clusters 
in P. trichocarpa, respectively, with the mutually highest correlation (mutual best-hit) 
in all-against-all comparison (Fig. 2E). Egr4 is the best-hit of vessel elements (Ptr1), and 
Ptr1 is the second best-hit of Egr4 (Fig. 2E). Both Egr6 and Egr1 have the highest cor-
relation with fusiform organizer cells (Ptr6). Fusiform and ray organizer cells share high 
transcriptomic similarity in P. trichocarpa (Additional file 1: Fig. S19), indicating that 
Egr6 and Egr1 could be the fusiform and ray organizer cells.
As an evolutionarily reversed trait, the terminally differentiated fusiform cells in T. 
aralioides are tracheids, which are a primitive form with the combined functions of ves-
sel elements and libriform fibers. The T. aralioides cell clusters Tar1 and Tar3 show the 
highest correlations with P. trichocarpa vessel elements (Ptr1) (Fig. 2F) and thus likely 
represent tracheids. Tar2 and ray parenchyma cells (Ptr8) are mutual best-hits, sug-
gesting Tar2 represents ray parenchyma cells. For each of the three eudicot species, we 
identified marker genes from the DEGs exclusively expressed in different cell clusters 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S24, S25, Additional file 8–10). Notably, all cell clusters in T. aral-
ioides show very low correlation to libriform fibers (Ptr7) (Fig. 2F), which implies that 
the fusiform lineage in T. aralioides has only one path toward tracheid/vessel charac-
teristics. In other words, T. aralioides tracheids share a similar developmental path with 
vessel elements. Tracheids have both water transportation and mechanical support func-
tions, which are the specialized functions of vessel elements and libriform fibers, respec-
tively [36]. Here our results indicate the transcriptomic similarity between T. aralioides 
tracheids and P. trichocarpa vessel elements, which share the water transportation func-
tion as their common feature.
Common and distinct developmental trajectories
The cell lineages in the four woody species were further compared by integrating their 
scRNA-seq data using the Seurat canonical correlation analysis pipeline [59] for two-
species graph-based cell clustering based on orthologous genes (Fig. 3). In addition, we 
devised a method to quantify distribution overlap between cells from different species 
(Fig. 4; Additional file 1: Fig. S26). P. trichocarpa and E. grandis two-species clustering 
(Fig. 3A(v), 3A(vi)) shows highly overlapped (Fig. 4A; overall distribution overlap >99%) 
fusiform and ray cell lineages (Fig. 3A(vii)). Egr6 was grouped with the P. trichocarpa ray 
organizers (Ptr3) in the two-species clustering (Fig. 3A(v)–(vii)), which reflects Egr6 as 
the best-hit of Ptr3 (Fig. 2E). We thus can also observe two cell lineages in the SDX of E. 
grandis, which are highly similar to those of P. trichocarpa differentiated from two types 
of organizer cells (Fig. 3A).
Two-species clustering of P. trichocarpa and T. aralioides also supports the conclu-
sion from pairwise correlation analysis (Fig. 3B). Almost no cells from T. aralioides are

grouped with libriform fibers (Ptr7) of P. trichocarpa, and Tar1 and Tar3 overlap with 
P. trichocarpa vessel elements (Ptr1) in UMAP. The fusiform lineage in T. aralioides 
has fusiform organizer (Tar5), fusiform early precursor (Tar9), fusiform intermediate 
precursor cells (low cell number), and tracheid cells (Tar1/Tar3) (Fig. 3B(v)–(vii)). The

ray lineage started from the ray organizer (Tar6) to ray precursor (Tar8) then to ray 
parenchyma cells (Tar2) (Fig. 3B(v)–(vii)). Based on the similar developmental paths 
among the three woody eudicots, we could identify distinct modules of orthologous 
groups of genes with temporal expression patterns along the pseudotime of each cell 
lineage in two-species analyses (Additional file 1: Fig. S27, S28, Additional file 11, 12).
In the two-species clustering of P. trichocarpa and L. chinense, we found that their ray 
lineages are highly similar, but the fusiform lineage in L. chinense exhibits a distinct path 
from that in P. trichocarpa (Fig. 3C). We identified cell clusters corresponding to fusi-
form early (Ptr4/Lch8), intermediate (Ptr2/Lch2), and late precursors/vessel elements 
(Ptr1/Lch1), which barely overlap between P. trichocarpa and L. chinense (Figs. 3C(v)–
(vii) and 4C). Despite their low transcriptomic correlation (Fig. 2G), fusiform organizer 
cells (Lch7) and libriform fibers (Lch3) of L. chinense could also be identified based on 
the expression of its homologs of the P. trichocarpa marker genes (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S29).
Overlapping cell populations between P. trichocarpa and each of the other three plants 
provides important insights into similarities and variation in developmental trajectories. 
To test whether such overlap could be caused by over-correction for dimensionality

reduction in two-species analysis, we conducted the same procedure for P. trichocarpa 
SDX cells with each of the previously reported scRNA-seq dataset from Arabidopsis 
leaves (Fig. 3D), Arabidopsis roots (Additional file 1: Fig. S30A) and rice (Oryza sativa) 
roots (Additional file 1: Fig. S30B), where a sizable number of xylem or vascular cells 
were present (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Most of the SDX cells from P. trichocarpa did 
not co-localize with the root and leaf cells from Arabidopsis and rice (Fig. 3D, Additional 
file 1: Fig. S30A, S30B). The distribution overlap between cells of P. trichocarpa and the 
other three woody species is much higher than between P. trichocarpa and Arabidop-
sis or rice (Fig. 4A–F). All of the xylem marker genes identified in previous scRNA-seq 
studies could be detected in our SDX scRNA-seq dataset (Additional file 1: Fig. S31). 
The distribution of the root and leaf xylem cells (magenta, Fig. 3D(iv), Additional file 1: 
Fig. S30A(iv), S30B(iv)) only barely overlaps with that of the P. trichocarpa SDX ves-
sel elements (Ptr1), libriform fibers (Ptr7), and the transition area of these two clusters. 
In addition, almost no Arabidopsis xylem cells co-localize with the cell-type determined 
libriform fiber cluster (Fig. 3D(iv), Additional file 1: Fig. S30A(iv)), which is consistent 
to the absence of libriform fibers of their source tissue as the primary roots in 5-day-old 
Arabidopsis [60–64]. The Arabidopsis xylem cells also do not overlap with P. trichocarpa 
ray parenchyma cells (Ptr8) (Fig. 3D(iv), Additional file 1: Fig. S30A(iv)), consistent to 
previous finding that ray parenchyma cells cannot be observed in Arabidopsis under 
normal growing conditions [31–33]. The relatively limited xylem cells from previous 
studies of Arabidopsis, which has incomplete xylem development and cell types, only 
provide a partial understanding of xylem transcriptomic variation. Overall, our results 
demonstrate more conserved and overlapping developmental paths of SDX across 
divergent woody angiosperms, whereas the developmental trajectories of SDX in the 
rosid P. trichocarpa are clearly distinct from xylem in different organs in another rosid 
Arabidopsis.
The conclusions from single- (Figs. 1 and 2) and two-species analyses (Figs. 3 and 4) 
are further supported by four-species combined analyses (Fig. 5). All four woody angio-
sperms have nearly identical ray cell lineages in their SDX (Fig. 5F–I). The three eud-
icots share similar fusiform cell lineages (Fig. 5J–L), except that T. aralioides does not 
have libriform fibers (Fig. 5L). The magnoliid L. chinense has a distinct fusiform cell line-
age with fusiform organizer cells and libriform fibers different from those of eudicots 
(Fig. 5M).
Expression of known genes in xylem cell lineages and their potential functions
We further examined the expression patterns of the known genes related to xylem devel-
opment (Additional file 13), including (1) VND6 and SND1 in the VNS family, master 
regulators of xylem/vasculature development [15]; (2) SND2, the common direct target 
of VND6 and SND1 [66]; (3) cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin biosynthesis genes for 
SCW deposition; (4) expansin for cell expansion; and (5) photosynthetic genes. In the 
three eudicots, P. trichocarpa, P. alba var. pyramidalis, and E. grandis, we found high 
expression of VND6, SND1, and SND2 in fusiform lineages, SCW biosynthesis genes 
in both fusiform and ray lineages, and the photosynthetic genes mainly in ray lineages 
(Additional file 13). In L. chinense, the expression level of the orthologs of VND6, SND1, 
SND2, expansin A6, and hemicellulose biosynthesis genes were much lower than that in 

Page 14 of 37

three eudicots due to their low expression. These discrepancies in gene expression pat-
terns between L. chinense and core eudicots underscore their distinct SDX cell lineages. 
Cellulose synthases, lignin biosynthesis genes, and photosynthetic genes exhibited simi-
lar expression patterns in each cell type among four angiosperms, which illustrates the 
conserved and critical roles of these genes during xylem development.
The VNS family was reported to be the master regulator for xylem development in 
both vessel- and tracheid-bearing species through direct activation of SND2 [15, 66, 
67]. Both the VNS family and SND2 were identified across all angiosperms, including

L. chinense, with similar gene numbers (Fig. 6A), suggesting their potential conserved 
roles in regulating angiosperm xylem cell differentiation. Similar to vessel-bearing angi-
osperms, T. aralioides also possesses homologs of VNS and SND2 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, 
gymnosperms, which also have tracheids instead of vessels, only have VNS but not 
SND2 homologs (Fig. 6A, Additional file 1: Fig. S32). In addition, the SCW biosynthesis 
genes, expansin, and photosynthetic genes identified in scUPlcmUP genes (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S9) are conserved with similar gene copy numbers across angiosperms (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S32).
To reveal the evolutionary patterns of these regulators and genes of xylem cell dif-
ferentiation, we compared their phylogenies with the scRNA-seq expression patterns 
(Fig. 6B–D, Additional file 14). The VNS family of vascular plants is divided into two

clades, and both of which contain genes from the four woody angiosperms with expres-
sion detected (Fig. 6B, D). Our results suggest that VNS family exerts conserved func-
tions throughout angiosperms, which was consistent to a previous study on VNS in land 
plants [15]. SND2, a direct target of VNS, was reported to be the key regulator of libri-
form fiber development [17, 68]. The absence of SND2 genes in many gymnosperms and 
seedless vascular plants is thus consistent with their lack of libriform fibers (Fig. 6A). 
Intriguingly, T. aralioides, which also lacks libriform fibers, does possess SND2 genes 
(Fig. 6A, C), but their expression was not detected in SDX cells (Fig. 6D). Namely, the 
function of SND2 could be turned off by the absence of this gene or its expression.
Discussion
Every direction of plant development, including upward/downward apical growth and 
inward/outward lateral growth, starts from stem cell proliferation followed by cell iden-
tity determination and then cell differentiation [2]. In the past few decades, the cell pro-
liferation, identity determination, and differentiation in SAM for upward and RAM for 
downward growth have been extensively studied [3–5], providing plentiful marker genes 
for recent scRNA-seq analyses to map the detailed cell lineages in apical growth. For 
lateral growth, vascular cambium is embedded inside the stems and cannot be directly 
visualized, so the physiological and morphological studies for xylem and phloem devel-
opment appear to be much challenging. Recent studies, mostly in Arabidopsis, started 
to reveal bifacial stem cell proliferation in vascular cambium [6–8, 14], but the corre-
sponding cell lineages still remain unclear. Furthermore, Arabidopsis does not have ray 
parenchyma cells [31–33], and its fiber cells remain immature without undergoing pro-
grammed cell death [34, 35], so insights from Arabidopsis would only show a partial per-
spective on xylem development. The SDX in woody plants generally has a full set of axial 
(libriform fibers and tracheids/vessel elements) and radial cells (ray parenchyma cells), 
and all types of cells develop into their mature stage through complete programmed cell 
death, providing a complete picture of xylem development trajectories. However, the 
intensive cell wall deposition and lignification with highly enriched phenolic compounds 
and other secondary metabolites constitute a major obstacle for many experiments. Take 
LCM for example, the penetration of laser cutting through SDX with thickened cell wall 
would be much more difficult than that for other tissue types with thinner cell wall. In 
addition, most woody plants are recalcitrant to genetic transformation, so functional 
validations of genes are often intractable. In short, woody species are suitable but more 
challenging for xylem research, whereas herbaceous plants are less ideal for unveiling 
complete xylem development.
The exploration of xylem cell development has been limited by the lack of compre-
hensive marker genes for cell type annotation. LCM was successfully used to isolate 
libriform fibers and vessel elements in P. trichocarpa for transcriptomic profiling [69, 
70], but the collection of ray parenchyma cells has remained challenging. Ray paren-
chyma cells in P. trichocarpa are uniseriate (single-layered) and surrounded by libri-
form fibers and vessel elements. To avoid the contamination from the other two cell 
types, we carefully collected a very small area of ray parenchyma cells in each tan-
gential section. Since extremely low amounts of area were collectable for ray paren-
chyma cells in each section, tremendous labor and time was needed for the section

preparation and cell collection. The time required for collecting enough ray paren-
chyma cells was sixfold more than that required for libriform fibers or vessel ele-
ments. The even more challenging task was to collect all three cell types from the 
same stem internodes with very limited tissue for the in parallel comparison of their 
transcriptomic profiles. Unlike in  situ hybridization targeted on a few genes, tran-
scriptomic sequencing of in  situ LCM-harvested samples provides comprehensive 
information for robust annotation of different xylem cell types and their representa-
tive gene sets for future studies.
A comprehensive understanding of plant cell development and evolution through 
comparative analyses of multi-species scRNA-seq data has been hindered by tech-
nical difficulty in robust protoplast isolation in divergent species spanning a large 
evolutionary scale. scRNA-seq requires high protoplast yield while minimizing cell 
debris. The lignified secondary cell wall in woody tissue, such as SDX, usually cannot 
be thoroughly removed during enzyme digestion, which causes a dilemma that higher 
protoplast yield comes with more abundant cell debris. Our efficient SDX protoplast 
isolation method for P. trichocarpa [38, 39] was successfully applied to L. chinense 
to harvest SDX protoplasts for 10x scRNA-seq. In contrast, SDX protoplast isola-
tion of E. grandis and T. aralioides was contaminated by abundant cell debris that can 
interfere with single-cell isolation in 10x Genomics Chromium. We thus used fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting coupled with the plate-based MARS-seq2.0 method [71] 
to increase the efficiency of single-cell isolation for scRNA-seq. With the establish-
ment of SDX protoplast isolation methods for L. chinense, E. grandis, and T. aralioides 
coupled with droplet- or plate-based library preparation, we were able to perform for 
the first time an evo-devo scRNA-seq analysis of cell lineages in four divergent plant 
species. Based on the clustering of homologous genes, our two-species and multi-
species analyses could reveal the similarity and differences between the cell types and 
trajectories across these angiosperms.
A recent xylem scRNA-seq study on a single species, Populus sp., concluded a dif-
ferent xylem developmental path [72]. In their proposed cell lineages, vessel elements 
(fusiform cells) differentiated from the same precursor cells as ray parenchyma cells 
(non-fusiform cells) rather than libriform fibers (the other fusiform-cell type). This 
model contradicts with previous anatomical evidence that both fusiform-cell types 
differentiate from the same precursors that are distinct from those of non-fusiform 
cells. Our results combining scRNA-seq and lcmRNA-seq (in situ cell-type transcrip-
tomic analysis) strongly support previous anatomical observations and provide a con-
sistent view in other woody angiosperms.
Another recent study on SDX of Populus alba var. pyramidalis [44] concluded that 
cambium and xylem mother cells differentiate into fusiform and ray lineages. The sep-
aration of the ray and fusiform lineages is consistent with our results. However, their 
marker genes used for cambium annotation, WOX4a, WOX4b, PXY, PIN1b, PIN1c, 
are expressed in both cambium and ray parenchyma cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S11 in 
Chen et al., 2021) [44]. Besides, HD-ZIP III genes were used to identify xylem mother 
cells and organizers, and these cells are in the early stage of xylem development 
[8, 51, 73]. A combined analysis of P. trichocarpa, P. alba var. pyramidalis, E. gran-
dis, T. aralioides, and L. chinense shows that these HD-ZIP III genes are not always 

Page 18 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
expressed in these early stage cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S33A). The reliance on the 
genes as universal markers resulted in mis-annotation by swapping ray parenchyma 
cells and early stage cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S33B). This misplacement of these 
two cell types led to a reverse cell lineage, in which ray parenchyma cells differentiate 
into xylem mother cells/organizers. Such incorrect interpretation underlines the risk 
of cell-type annotation and in situ hybridization validation based on only a few genes, 
as well as the necessity of using whole transcriptomic profiles from lcmRNA-seq for 
accurate cell-type annotation in our study (Additional file 1: Fig. S33C).
In this study, we used HD-ZIP III as the marker gene for cell type annotation of organ-
izer cells, but its gene expression pattern is not conserved between P. trichocarpa and 
other species in this study. The results raised an issue: Is HD-ZIP III a robust marker 
gene for the identification of organizer cells? If the answer is yes, then organizer cells 
would not exist in all species due to the nearly absence of HD-ZIP III expression in some 
species (Additional file 1: Fig. S33A). If the answer is no, then it brings up the next issue: 
Whether all species in this study possess organizer cells? If organizer cells are a common 
cell type, then different species would use various mechanisms, without HD-ZIP III, for 
the production of organizer cells. If organizer cells do not exist in certain species, the 
initials would require other cell types or other mechanisms for the maintenance. Based 
on the current knowledge, SAM, RAM, and vascular cambium in Arabidopsis all require 
organizer cells for the maintenance of stem cells/initials, the existence of organizer cells 
in all of the species in this study appears to be highly possible. HD-ZIP III, instead, seems 
not necessary for organizer cells in every species.
In Arabidopsis, organizer cells were found in the vessel element differentiation, but 
whether the differentiation of libriform fibers and ray parenchyma cells involve organizer 
cells remained unknown. HD-ZIP III played a critical role in organizer cells [8] in Arabi-
dopsis and was used as a marker gene for organizer cell annotation in P. trichocarpa in 
this study. Besides the regulation of vessel element differentiation, previous studies in 
Arabidopsis and poplar have shown that HD-ZIP III can also accelerate the differenti-
ation of libriform fibers [73, 74], suggesting the existence of organizer cells in the cell 
types beyond vessel elements.
Two contradicting conclusions were reported on the cell types of tracheary elements 
in T. aralioides [75, 76]. A previous study reported that T. aralioides possesses primi-
tive vessel elements as the second type of tracheary elements in addition to tracheids 
[75]. While these two cell types have very similar cell length and width, the primitive 
vessel elements possess perforation plates without pit membranes. However, another 
study maintained that T. aralioides is vessel-less [76] and suggested that the pit mem-
branes of some tracheids are destroyed in planta, causing them to appear anatomically 
similar to primitive vessel elements [76]. In our multi-species results, the fusiform line-
age in T. aralioides is highly similar to that of vessel elements in other eudicots, and it 
does not diverge into two terminal cell types. Based on these, two possible scenarios can 
explain the observation of cells that look like primitive vessel elements. First, if there are 
two types of tracheary elements, tracheids and primitive vessel elements probably share 
comparable developmental paths that cannot be easily distinguished. Second, if there is 
only one type of tracheary elements, the tracheids might enter terminal differentiation in 
different stages, causing their slight anatomical variations.

It is still debated whether the cell fate of fusiform cells is determined at the very begin-
ning in the initial cells or later during the differentiation of xylary derivatives [77]. Based 
on the ubiquitous expression of VNS family genes in all early fusiform cells [78], it has 
been proposed that all fusiform cells originally differentiate toward vessel elements but 
become committed toward libriform fibers upon an external or positional cue [77]. As a 
response to mechanical stress, for example, tension wood contains drastically increased 
libriform fibers [36, 79]. In this study, the fusiform lineage in T. aralioides is similar to 
that in P. trichocarpa and E. grandis (Fig. 5J–L). The fusiform lineage in T. aralioides 
solely developed into tracheid, and both tracheids and vessel elements share highly 
similar transcriptomes. The results indicated that the fusiform lineages of P. trichocarpa 
and E. grandis undergo the same differentiation path as that of T. aralioides into ves-
sel elements or tracheids, which supports the hypothesis from the previous studies. 
Interestingly, the libriform fibers (Ptr7) are the most disjoint cell cluster (Fig. 1B, Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S18), implying the differentiation into libriform fibers took place rap-
idly, leaving few intermediate cells to be captured for scRNA-seq. Such disconnection 
in cell states has also been demonstrated for malaria parasite cell types, where an abrupt 
transcriptomic change is caused by fast turn-on/off of transcriptional modules [80]. Our 
results suggest that fusiform cells differentiate into vessel elements by default, but can 
rapidly switch to libriform fibers.
Conclusions
Using lcmRNA-seq and scRNA-seq of multiple species, our results provide crucial 
insights into the formation and developmental dynamics of SDX. In particular, we dis-
covered that (1) the radial (ray parenchyma cells) and axial (libriform fibers and trac-
heids/vessel elements) systems in SDX develop through two cell lineages from ray 
and fusiform organizer cells to precursor cells then to terminally differentiated cells 
(Fig. 5N–U); (2) The transcriptomic profile of tracheids is most similar to that of vessel 
elements instead of libriform fibers, with the lack of SND2 genes or their expression in 
SDX in vessel-less seed plants; (3) The variation in the single-cell transcriptomic pro-
files reflects both evolutionary relationships across species and developmental diver-
gence across organs (Fig. 4); (4) In contrast to highly conserved ray lineages, fusiform 
lineages are more variable across core eudicots, basal eudicots, and magnoliids (Fig. 5). 
Xylem constitutes the largest biomass on Earth [37] as the essential tissue for two major 
functions in vascular plants. The mechanical support allows vascular plants to dominate 
current terrestrial ecosystems by towering over their bryophyte relatives. Water trans-
portation delivers critical elements to whole plant bodies. By integrating high-resolution 
single-cell analyses across multiple species with evolutionary divergence of over a hun-
dred million years, we provide a comprehensive view of how cells form and vary in SDX. 
This approach is applicable to other plant species, and further studies of the entire plant 
kingdom can potentially shed light on the origin of vascular development.
Methods
Plant materials and sampling
P. trichocarpa plants were grown in a walk-in growth chamber under 16-h light/8-
h dark conditions at 24–26°C. Tree stems were collected from 8-month-old plants.

Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
For protoplast isolation, stems below the 12th internode were used. For LCM, the 8th 
internode of the tree stems was harvested. E. grandis plants were grown in a walk-in 
greenhouse for 8 months with sunlight and temperature around 20–30°C. Tree stems 
below the 18th internode were collected for protoplast isolation. The branches from 
wild-grown T. aralioides in Hutian Elementary School (Yangmingshan National Park, 
Taiwan) were collected for protoplast isolation. Around 1-year-old plants of L. chinense 
were purchased from Nanping Senke Seedlings Co., Ltd. (Fujian, China), and the stems 
below around the 10th internode were used for protoplast isolation.
SDX protoplast isolation
The SDX protoplast isolation was carried out mainly based on our previously estab-
lished protocol [38, 39, 81]. Tree stems were cut into 8-cm segments. Debarked stem 
segments were dipped into freshly prepared enzyme solution (20 mM MES, pH 5.7, 0.25 
M mannitol, 20 mM KCl, 1.5% wt/vol cellulase R10, 0.4% wt/vol Macerozyme R10, 10 
mM ­CaCl2, and 0.1% BSA) for ~3 h at room temperature. Enzyme-digested stem seg-
ments were transferred to MMG solution (4 mM MES, pH 5.7, 0.25 M mannitol and 
15 mM ­MgCl2, room temperature) or modified MMG solution (4 mM MES, pH 5.7, 
0.25 M mannitol and 20 mM KCl, room temperature, for subsequent 10x Chromium 
scRNA-seq) to release SDX protoplasts. The protoplasts were filtered with 70-μm nylon 
mesh, pelleted at 900g centrifugation for 3 min at room temperature, and resuspended in 
MMG solution. The isolated SDX protoplasts were observed using a fluorescence micro-
scope (Additional file 1: Fig. S34).
10x Chromium scRNA‑seq
Single-cell sequencing libraries of two biological replicates (one replicate in one batch, 
total two batches) for P. trichocarpa and one biological replicate for L. chinense SDX 
protoplasts were generated using Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 
or v3 (10x Genomics) according to user manual. The P. trichocarpa SDX protoplasts in 
the second batch (10x_Batch2 in Additional file 1: Fig. S35A) were stained with a work-
ing concentration of 0.008 μg/μL fluorescein diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and sorted 
by a BD FACSAria™ III cell sorter (BD, USA) before generating the single-cell sequenc-
ing libraries. To minimize the formation of doublets or even multiplets, the number 
of loaded cells was following the instruction in the manual of 10x Genomics for an 
estimated multiplet rate less than 8%. The scRNA-seq libraries of P. trichocarpa were 
sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 or NovaSeq 6000 (Genomics Co., Ltd), and the 
libraries of L. chinense were sequenced by NovaSeq (Novogene Co., Ltd). The sequenced 
data of P. trichocarpa and L. chinense were individually processed using Cell Ranger (10x 
Genomics; v5.0.1) with the commands “cellranger mkref” and “cellranger count”. The 
Cell Ranger-compatible references were built with the current genome sequences and 
annotations (see below) for the following read alignment and quantification. The single-
cell transcript abundance matrices were generated and named as “filtered_feature_bc_
matrix.h5” by Cell Ranger. The transcript abundance of each gene was calculated based 
on the number of unique molecular identifier (UMI)-tagged transcripts as “UMI counts”. 
A total of 19,007 and 2977 transcriptomes were obtained for individual SDX cells in P.

trichocarpa and L. chinense, respectively, each with UMI counts more than 500 (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S1). In P. trichocarpa, total 28,691 genes were detected among the tran-
scriptomic dataset, which represents 82.7% of the whole annotated genes (34,699 genes) 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S1). In L. chinense, 17,926 genes were detected, representing 50.8% 
of the whole annotated genes (35,269 genes). One batch of P. trichocarpa scRNA-seq 
results (10x_Batch1 in Additional file  1: Fig. S35A, S35B) was used for the following 
analyses.
Cell sorting and plate‑based scRNA‑seq
The massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq2.0 (MARS-seq2.0) [71] protocol was adapted 
for sequencing E. grandis and T. aralioides SDX protoplasts using five and four bio-
logical replicates, respectively (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Four biological replicates with 
total 6 rounds of scRNA-seq for T. aralioides were performed in two batches in differ-
ent seasons. For the first batch (MARS-seq_Batch1 in Additional file 1: Fig. S35D), two 
trees were used in summer (two rounds of scRNA-seq). For the second batch (MARS-
seq_Batch2 in Additional file 1: Fig. S35D), four trees, including the two trees from first 
batch, were used in winter (four rounds). Three hundred eighty four-well plates were pre-
pared using Beckman Biomek NXR Liquid Handling Workstation (Beckman, USA) and 
PerkinElmer Janus MDT (PerkinElmer, USA), with 2 μL lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 
0.2U/μL RNAsin Plus and 1 nM reverse transcription (RT) primers with barcodes) in 
each well. E. grandis and T. aralioides SDX protoplasts were stained with a working 
concentration of 0.008 μg/μL fluorescein diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The samples 
were analyzed and sorted by a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP (Beckman, USA) or BD 
FACSMelody™ cell sorter (BD, USA) with 488-nm laser excitation and a 100-μm noz-
zle. Cells were identified based on forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), chlorophyll 
fluorescence (663–737 nm), and fluorescein fluorescence (475–650 nm). A single cell 
was isolated under the “single cell mode” into individual wells of the prepared 384-well 
plates. After sorting, the plates were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C 
until processing. The plates were thawed at room temperature, heated to 95°C for 3 min, 
and cooled on an iced metal block. The RT reagent mixture, including 1:80,000-diluted 
ERCC spike-in RNA, was dispensed into each well using Mantis v3.2 (Formulatrix, Mas-
sachusetts, USA). After RT and Exonuclease I treatment, all wells in each plate were 
pooled together through 3-min centrifugation at 1800 rpm (Heraeus Multifuge X3R 
with a TX-750 swinging bucket rotor, Thermo Fisher, USA). Further processing of the 
plate pools followed the MARS-seq2.0 protocol, including second-strand synthesis, 
in vitro transcription, DNase treatment, RNA fragmentation, ligation and plate barcod-
ing, and second RT. The quality of the libraries was assessed by quantitative PCR using 
QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The cDNA 
pools were amplified by a final PCR with the introduction of Illumina I7 indices. Librar-
ies were paired-end sequenced (R1:130, R2:20) on Illumina NextSeq 500 (Genomics 
Core, Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Sequencing data was 
analyzed using the MARS-seq2.0 mapping and demultiplexing pipeline [71]. In E. gran-
dis, total 23,086 genes were detected among the transcriptomic dataset, which repre-
sents 63.5% of the whole annotated genes (36,349 genes) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). The 
first batch of E. grandis scRNA-seq results (MARS-seq_Batch1 in Additional file 1: Fig. 

Page 22 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
S35C) was used for the following analyses. In T. aralioides, 26,226 genes were detected, 
representing 74.2% of the whole annotated genes (35,328 genes). The first batch of T. 
aralioides scRNA-seq results (MARS-seq_Batch1 in Additional file  1: Fig. S35D) was 
used for the following analyses. For performance comparison between 10x Chromium 
and plate-based scRNA-seq (MARS-seq), five biological replicates of P. trichocarpa SDX 
protoplasts were performed using plate-based scRNA-seq by the same pipeline as for 
E. grandis and T. aralioides (MARS-seq_Batch1 and MARS-seq_Batch2 in Additional 
file 1: Fig. S35B). In P. trichocarpa, 27,581 genes were detected, which represents 79.5% 
of the whole annotated genes (34,699 genes) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).
The reproducibility of the scRNA‑seq results
To ensure the reproducibility of the scRNA-seq results and the robustness of the meth-
ods, scRNA-seq for additional biological replicates of P. trichocarpa was performed. The 
transcriptomes of 25,166 cells from seven biological replicates were obtained using 10x 
Genomics Chromium technology and MARS-seq (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). An inte-
grated analysis of all seven replicates shows highly overlapped distribution of cells from 
different replicates (Additional file 1: Fig. S35A, S35B). The results also show that sin-
gle-cell transcriptomes based on 10x scRNA-seq and MARS-seq are comparable (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S35B; distribution overlap: 99.5%), which indicates the two methods 
for cell isolation and library preparation have little effects on the transcriptomic profiles 
observed. For E. grandis, the cells from two batches with a total of five biological repli-
cates are also highly overlapped (Additional file 1: Fig. S35C; 99.7%). Since T. aralioides 
samples can only be collected from the field instead of a temperature-controlled green-
house, we sequenced another batch of samples from four biological replicates in differ-
ent seasons with additional trees (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). The distribution of cells from 
the two batches is almost completely overlapped (Additional file 1: Fig. S35D; 100.0%). 
By examining the batch effects of biological replicates and library preparation methods, 
we demonstrate the high reproducibility of our scRNA-seq results. In addition, we com-
pared our P. trichocarpa data with the SDX scRNA-seq data of another poplar species, 
Populus alba var. pyramidalis, from a recent study [44]. Two-species clustering of P. alba 
var. pyramidalis and P. trichocarpa shows that their cell populations largely overlapped 
(Fig.  4G, Additional file  1: Fig. S36; 96.7%). Five-species clustering also demonstrates 
that the fusiform and ray lineages of P. alba var. pyramidalis are conserved with those in 
P. trichocarpa and E. grandis, which is consistent with their close evolutionary relation-
ships (Additional file 1: Fig. S37).
Dimensionality reduction and cell clustering
For P. trichocarpa and L. chinense, the dimensionality reduction and cell clustering were 
performed by Cell Ranger (10x Genomics; v5.0.1) using the single-cell transcript abun-
dance matrices with the command “cellranger reanalysis”. For E. grandis and T. aralioides, 
the results from MARS-seq2.0 were converted into the single-cell transcript abundance 
matrices as the input files for Cell Ranger to exert the subsequent command “cellranger 
reanalysis” for dimensionality reduction and cell clustering. The principal component 
analysis was performed, and the top 10 principal components were used to conduct 
UMAP and unsupervised K-means clustering with the parameters “umap_n_neighbors

Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
	
= 50” and “umap_min_dist = 0.5”. Differential expression analysis was performed fol-
lowing the pipeline in Cell Ranger of 10x Genomics platform using two methods. Nega-
tive binomial exact test (two-sided), the hypothesis test based on the sSeq method [82], 
was applied to DEG identification in default. When the counts of transcript abundance 
in both comparing groups were greater than 900, the hypothesis test would be switched 
to asymptotic beta test (two-sided) adapted from the implementation in edgeR [83]. For 
each cell cluster, the DEGs were identified by treating the cells inside and the cells out-
side this cluster as two samples. Take the cell cluster Ptr1 as an example, each gene was 
tested whether its mean expression in Ptr1 differs from that in all other cell clusters. The 
P values from the multiple comparisons were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg method 
(BH method) [84] to control the false discovery rate (FDR) as 0.05. DEGs of each cell 
cluster were obtained using the output table “differential_expression.csv” in the folder 
“kmeans_X_clusters” generated by Cell Ranger. The “X” in “kmeans_X_clusters” was 
corresponding to the cluster number in each species. Only the clusters with more than 
or equal to 5 cells would be considered as cell clusters. The cutoff of DEGs was set as 
adjusted P value < 0.05 and the absolute value of ­log2-fold change ­(log2FC) ≥ 1. The UMI 
counts of each cell were divided by the total UMI counts and multiplied by a scale factor 
(1000) to obtain the normalized UMI counts. The ­log2-transformation was applied to the 
normalized UMI counts to plot the gene transcript abundance.
Laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing (lcmRNA‑seq)
The 8th internodes from six P. trichocarpa stems were cut into 5- or 10-mm segments, 
frozen by liquid nitrogen immediately, and stored at −80°C. The 5-mm segments were 
separated into four quarters at −20°C in the chamber of a cryostat. The segments were 
stuck on cryostat chucks using Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek, USA) and 
sliced into 16-μm thick sections using cryostat (Leica CM1900) at −20°C. The cryo-
sections were placed onto the PET membrane of metal-frame slides (Leica, USA) and 
dehydrated using 99.5% ethanol. Around 1,600,000 μm2 area from approximate 20 cell 
layers of cryo-sections (transverse or tangential) of two P. trichocarpa plants was col-
lected using laser microdissection systems (Leica LMD7000), and evenly pooled as one 
biological replicate. A total of three biological replicates were collected for each cell 
type. The dissected cells were collected within 30 min in 500-μL eppendorf caps loaded 
with 50 μL RLT buffer (QIAGEN, USA) and 1% beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 
USA), frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Total RNA from dissected cells 
was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA) according to the manufac-
turer instruction. The mRNA of each cell type was amplified using Arcturus® RiboAmp® 
HS PLUS RNA Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) following the user guide. 
The amplified mRNA of each sample was used to construct sequencing libraries using 
NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, USA) 
according to the instruction manual. The RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on Illumina 
NextSeq 500 platform (Genomics Core, Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, 
Taiwan) to obtain the reads with paired-end 75-bp length. We avoided the sample con-
tamination throughout the whole process of laser capture microdissection based on the 
following pipelines: (i) Issue of cell visualization. During cell collection, we visualized 
and selected our targeting area, which contained the cell type of interest. For a sample 

Page 24 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
section, one side can be visualized, and the other side contacted the slide, which cannot 
be visualized. When laser cut though the selected area on a section, we collected both 
visualizable and unvisualizable regions. To avoid the collection of unwanted cells, the 
thickness of sections should contain only one layer of cells or should be even less than 
the length or width of one layer of cells, which can thus avoid the unwanted cells hiding 
in the unvisualizable regions. We set the thickness of cross and tangential sections as 
16 μm. For cross sections of libriform fiber collection, the thickness is much less than 
the cell length of libriform fiber (500–750 μm) [85]. For tangential sections of vessel ele-
ment collection, the thickness is also much less than the cell diameter of vessel elements 
(34–48 μm) [85]. (ii) Issue of residual fragments on slides. Laser cutting is actually a pro-
cess of burning out the cells by laser on the selected paths. While burning out the cells, 
laser cutting also generates tiny fragments. These fragments either would fall down into 
the collecting caps along with the targeting cell area or remained on the slides. The frag-
ments remained on the slides may fall down and get collected in the next rounds of cut-
ting. Thus, each round of cutting would result in the collection of targeting cell area and 
the fragments generated on such round or previous rounds. As a result, each slide was 
only used for the collection on one cell type to avoid cross contamination of cell types 
caused by the collection of unwanted residual fragments.
Paraffin sectioning
Around 1-mm segments were cut from 3rd to 6th stem internodes of P. trichocarpa and 
were fixed using 100% acetone for 40 min under vacuum at 4°C. These segments were 
further fixed by 100% acetone at 4°C overnight then at 37°C for 1.5 h. The segments were 
placed into serial n-butanol:acetone solution as 30:70, 50:50, 70:30, 90:10, and 100:0 v/v 
at 58°C followed by serial paraffin:n-butanol solution as 50:50, 60:40, 80:20, and 100:0 v/v 
at 58°C. The segments were used to generate 16-μm transverse sections by a microtome 
(Microm, HM355E). The paraffin embedded in the sections were removed with xylene 
for 15 min and 99.5% ethanol for 30 min.
Microscopic imaging
The transverse and tangential sections were observed under Olympus BX53 Upright 
Microscope in bright field. The sections for LCM were examined using the embedded 
camera function in laser microdissection systems (Leica LMD7000). The lignin fluores-
cence was observed by the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength as 360–
370 nm and 420–460 nm, respectively.
lcmRNA‑seq data analysis
The sequencing raw reads were preprocessed with fastp [86] (v0.20.1) using five argu-
ments “--detect_adapter_for_pe, --correction, --cut_front, --cut_tail and --disable_trim_
poly_g”. The adapter sequences and low-quality sequences (mean quality value < 20) at 
the both 5′ and 3′ ends of each read were removed. The reads with any of the follow-
ing features were discarded: (1) shorter than 15 bps, (2) containing more than five N 
bases and (3) including more than 40% of bases with low quality (quality value < 15). 
The filtered reads were mapped to the P. trichocarpa reference genome with HISAT2 
[87, 88] (v2.2.1) using four arguments “--max-intronlen 17787, --secondary, --fr and 

Page 25 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
	
--rna-strandness”. The parameter of the argument “--max-intronlen 17787” as maximum 
intron length was obtained from the current P. trichocarpa genome structural annota-
tion (see below). The transcriptome quantification was performed using StringTie [89] 
(v2.1.3b) with the current annotation to obtain the raw read counts and transcripts per 
million (TPM) of each gene. The differential expression analysis was implemented with 
the negative-binomial-based test (two-sided) in DESeq2 [90] (v1.28.1) using the raw read 
counts. The FDR was controlled with BH method [84], and the significance level was set 
as 0.05. DEGs of each cell type were identified under the cutoff set as the absolute value 
of ­log2FC ≥ 1 compared with the other cell types (Additional file 15). For example, the 
DEGs of libriform fibers were the genes with the absolute value of ­log2FC ≥ 1 both in 
libriform fibers/vessel elements and libriform fibers/ray parenchyma cells.
Correlation analysis between scRNA‑seq and lcmRNA‑seq data
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between the transcriptome of each cell 
from scRNA-seq and each cell type from lcmRNA-seq data. UMI counts and average 
TPM were used to represent the transcript abundance of the transcriptome data of each 
cell in scRNA-seq and each cell type in lcmRNA-seq, respectively.
Transcript abundance quantification of SDX
The RNA-seq raw reads from three biological replicates of SDX in P. trichocarpa were 
downloaded from NCBI GEO database using the accession number GSE81077 [69]. The 
RNA-seq data was processed using the same pipeline as lcmRNA-seq data analysis men-
tioned above to obtain TPM of each gene in SDX.
Transcript abundance of the gene sets in different GO terms
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of A. thaliana genes were obtained from TAIR (The 
Arabidopsis Information Resource) database [91]. The corresponding GO terms of each 
P. trichocarpa gene were assigned by the best hit to A. thaliana genes provided in Phyto-
zome database [92]. In each GO term analysis, the set of P. trichocarpa genes related to 
the target GO terms with all descendants (child terms) would be used. For each gene, the 
local transcript abundance at each cell point was estimated with the weighted average 
of normalized UMI counts calculated using Gaussian kernel smoother. The Euclidean 
distance used in the kernel smoother was based on the top 10 principal components 
from Cell Ranger (10x Genomics). The relative transcript abundances were then defined 
as the ratio between the local transcript abundance of each cell and the mean local tran-
script abundance. The mean relative transcript abundance in the gene set of interest was 
calculated for each cell. The results were visualized as a heatmap on the UMAP from 
Cell Ranger (10x Genomics). Total 27, 69, and 43 P. trichocarpa genes were used for the 
analyses of “meristem initiation,” “cellulose biosynthetic process,” and “hemicellulose 
metabolic process,” respectively.
Transcriptomic analysis for SDX from different internodes
DEGs of each internode section were identified using the same analysis pipe-
line described in lcmRNA-seq data analysis. The principal component analysis was 

Page 26 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
performed using the normalized counts output from DESeq2 [90] (v1.36.0), and top two 
principal components were used for visualization.
Quantification of marker gene transcript abundance in fusiform and ray lineages
Based on the clustering and UMAP results from Cell Ranger (10x Genomics), the pseu-
dotime analysis for P. trichocarpa cells was performed by Slingshot [93] (v2.4.0) using 
our defined cell lineages as fusiform and ray lineages. For each gene, the expected 
transcript abundances along each lineage were estimated by Nadaraya-Watson kernel 
regression estimation [94, 95] with Gaussian kernel using normalized UMI counts as the 
response variable and pseudotime as the explanatory variable.
Identification of homologous genes
We used sequence similarities to identify homologous protein-coding genes encoded 
in genomes of the four woody angiosperms and 10 other species with a balanced cov-
erage of the plant diversity, including Physcomitrium patens, Marchantia polymorpha, 
Selaginella moellendorffii, Pinus taeda, Gnetum montanum, Amborella trichopoda, 
Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Coffea canephora, and Solanum lycopersicum. 
An all-against-all BLASTP search [96, 97] (v2.6.0) was conducted for the amino acid 
sequences with an e-value cutoff of ­10−15. OrthoMCL [98] (v1.3) was used to cluster 
the protein-coding genes based on their BLASTP similarities into orthologous groups 
using the Markov Cluster Algorithm [99] with an inflation of 1.5 (Additional file 10). 
For the cross-species analyses, the ortholog transcript abundance was used from a set 
of orthologous groups. The ortholog transcript abundance was calculated as the sum 
of gene transcript abundance within each orthologous group. The ortholog transcript 
abundance was normalized with the total ortholog transcript abundance in each cell, 
and then multiplied by a scale factor (1000). The ­log2-transformation was applied to the 
normalized ortholog transcript abundance to plot the ortholog transcript abundance. 
Total 25,733 orthologous groups were used in the cross-species analyses. Orthologous 
groups #1284, #1746, and #8129 represent VNS family orthologs. Orthologous group 
#4898 is used as the collection of SND2 gene orthologs.
Pairwise correlation analysis among cell clusters
For P. trichocarpa, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between each pair 
of major cell clusters (Ptr1–Ptr8) using the average normalized UMI counts within each 
cell cluster. For two-species comparisons, the average normalized ortholog transcript 
abundance was calculated within each major cell cluster (except Egr9, Egr10, Tar10, and 
Lch10) for generating Pearson’s correlation coefficients between each pair of cross-spe-
cies cell clusters.
MetaCell analysis of P. trichocarpa SDX cells
As an alternative to unsupervised K-means clustering and UMAP visualization, the 
MetaCell package [55] (v0.3.41) was used to group the P. trichocarpa SDX cells and 

Page 27 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
	
project them onto a two-dimensional plot. A total of 4278 variable genes were selected 
as marker genes (T_tot = 20, T_top3 = 1, T_szcor = −0.01, T_vm = 0.2, and T_niche 
= 0.05) for constructing k-nearest neighbor graphs with K = 40, followed by cocluster-
ing with bootstrapping based on 1000 iterations of resampling 75% of the cells and an 
approximated target minimum metacell size of 50. Unbalanced edges were filtered with 
K = 40 and alpha = 3. The individual cells were then plotted in a two-dimensional pro-
jection (Additional file 1: Fig. S18).
Two‑, four‑, or five‑species scRNA‑seq data integration for woody plants
Seurat pipeline (v4.0.3) was used for the integration for the scRNA-seq results from 
multiple species [59, 100]. Only the cells with more than 200 detected orthologs and 
the orthologs detected in more than 3 cells were included in the analysis. The ortholog 
transcript abundance in the filtered data was normalized according to Seurat guideline. 
Top 2000 highly variable orthologs were identified in each species and used as the input 
of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The correlated gene modules were identified 
and presented as the cross-species cells embedding in a shared low-dimensional space. 
L2-normalization was then performed on the cell embedding to reduce the global differ-
ent between datasets. The anchors, defined as the mutual nearest neighbors between data-
sets, were identified with K-nearest neighbors (K = 5) using 2000 highly variable orthologs 
among two, four, or five species. After anchor scoring and anchor weighting, the anchors 
were then used for data integration. UMAP and cell clustering were performed based on 
shared nearest neighbor modularity optimization. The determination for the cell clusters 
(color) in two-species clustering (P. trichocarpa, E. grandis, T. aralioides and L. chinense, 
Fig. 3A(vii), 3B(vii), 3C(vii)) was mainly based on the majority cell clusters (color) from sin-
gle-species clustering results. Take a cell cluster in two-species clustering for P. trichocarpa 
and E. grandis as an example, if this cell cluster contains 100 cells, 50 from P. trichocarpa 
(48 in red cluster and 2 in brown cluster) and 50 from E. grandis (30 in red cluster and 20 
in brown cluster), then all 100 cells would be defined as red cell cluster. For the two-species 
clustering, the cell clusters of P. alba var. pyramidalis were assigned using the co-located 
cell clusters in P. trichocarpa (Additional file 1: Fig. S36(vii)).
Data comparisons of scRNA‑seq data from same species in different batches or different 
platforms
Four batches of P. trichocarpa, two batches of E. grandis, and two batches of T. aralioides 
scRNA-seq data were integrated and visualized respectively following the Seurat pipe-
line (v4.0.3) and UMAP mentioned above (Additional file 1: Fig. S35).
Reanalysis of Arabidopsis, rice and P. alba var. pyramidalis scRNA‑seq data
For Arabidopsis leaves [29], the scRNA-seq data (10x Genomics v2) of one biological rep-
licate (genotype ATML1p::YFP-RCI2A) was downloaded from NCBI GEO database using 
the accession number GSE167135 as single-cell transcript abundance matrices in one file 
(filtered_gene_bc_matrices-_h5.h5). This h5 file was analyzed with the command “cell-
ranger reanalysis” in Cell Ranger (10x Genomics; v5.0.1) to obtain the UMAP and unsuper-
vised K-means clustering results (Additional file 1: Fig. S38A). According to Lopez-Anido 
et al. [29], the xylem cells in Arabidopsis leaves can be identified using the gene expression 

Page 28 of 37
Tung et al. Genome Biology            (2023) 24:3 
of AT3G21270 (Additional file 1: Fig. S38A). For Arabidopsis roots [20], the scRNA-seq data 
with three biological replicates of wild type was downloaded from NCBI GEO database 
under the accession number GSE123013 as single-cell transcript abundance matrices com-
posed of three separated files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx). The three biological 
replicates of the wild-type cell transcriptomes were integrated and processed (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S38B) by Seurat as mentioned above. According to Ryu et al. [20], the xylem cells 
in Arabidopsis roots can be identified using the gene expression of BHLH30 (AT1G68810) 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S38B). For rice roots [28], the scRNA-seq raw reads from two bio-
logical replicates of wild type were downloaded from NCBI SRA database under the acces-
sion number PRJNA706435. Transcriptome quantification, followed by the UMAP and 
unsupervised K-means clustering, was performed by Cell Ranger (10x Genomics; v5.0.1) 
using the command “cellranger mkref” and “cellranger count” (Additional file 1: Fig. S38C). 
According to Zhang et al. [28], the xylem cells in rice roots can be identified using the gene 
expression of Os01g0750300 (Additional file 1: Fig. S38C). For Populus alba var. pyramida-
lis wood tissues [44], the scRNA-seq raw reads were downloaded from National Genomics 
Data Center under BioProject accession number PRJCA005543. Transcriptome quantifica-
tion was performed by Cell Ranger (10x Genomics; v5.0.1) using the genome sequence and 
annotation of P. trichocarpa with the command “cellranger mkref” and “cellranger count”. 
Each reanalyzed scRNA-seq dataset of Arabidopsis roots and leaves, rice roots, and P. alba 
var. pyramidalis SDX were integrated with the SDX scRNA-seq results of P. trichocarpa by 
Seurat using the pipeline mentioned above.
Cell density of overlapped cells
We developed a method to quantify distribution overlap between cells from two different 
species (Fig. 4) or samples (Additional file 1: Fig. S35) based on minimal spanning trees 
(MSTs) [101, 102]. MSTs were constructed from integrated UMAP plots (Additional file 1: 
Fig. S26A, S266E). Subgraphs were obtained by removing cross-species or cross-sample 
edges (Additional file 1: Fig. S26B, S26C, S26F, S26G). The center node (with the high-
est closeness centrality) was determined for each subgraph (Additional file 1: Fig. S26D, 
S26H). MST construction, graph determination, and closeness centrality calculation were 
performed using igraph [103] (v1.2.6) in R. For single-node subgraphs, the only node was 
directly defined as the center node (Additional file 1: Fig. S26D, S26H). The distribution 
overlap was quantified and visualized based on the density distribution of center nodes 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S26I) with the following procedures. Individual two-dimensional ker-
nel density was calculated using MASS [104] (v7.3-54) from the distribution of center nodes 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S26J, S26K), weighted by the number of center nodes and the propor-
tion of cells of each species or sample (Additional file 1: Fig. S26L), and concatenated into 
a single density map (Additional file 1: Fig. S26M). For multi-species analyses, the density 
maps were normalized by the total density values of P. trichocarpa cells (Fig. 4, Additional 
file 1: Fig. S26N). For the reproducibility analyses of P. trichocarpa, the density maps were 
normalized based on the first batch of single-cell transcriptomic data from 10x Genomics 
Chromium technology (Additional file 1: S26N; 10x_Batch1 in Additional file 1: Fig. S35A, 
S35B). For the reproducibility analyses of E. grandis and T. aralioides, the normalization of 
density maps was based on the first batch of single-cell transcriptomic data from MARS-
seq (Additional file 1: S26N; MARS-seq_Batch1 in Additional file 1: Fig. S35C, S35D).

Pseudotime trajectory analysis and lineage curve construction
The pseudotime analysis was performed by Slingshot [93] (v2.0.0) based on the integrated 
UMAP from Seurat. From our defined cell lineages as tracheid, vessel element, libriform 
fiber, and ray parenchyma lineages, the pseudotime of each cell in our defined cell lineages 
was obtained, and the cells were ordered based on their corresponding pseudotime. The 
window size was set as 21 cells and slid one cell at a time to calculate the moving average 
from the ortholog transcript abundance (UMI) in each cell. For example, one orthologous 
group in the first 21 cells with minimal pseudotime in a certain cell lineage would gener-
ate an average of transcript abundance, and such orthologous group in the 2nd to 22nd 
cells would generate another average. The union of all of these averages is named as mov-
ing average. The differentially expressed orthologous groups (DEOs) were identified using 
the command “FindAllMarkers” in Seurat with MAST [105] (v1.18.0), which was based 
on the hurdle model tailored to scRNA-seq analysis. Two-sided tests were performed, 
and the output P values were adjusted based on Bonferroni correction. Under the crite-
ria of adjusted P value < 0.05, DEOs were obtained as the orthologous groups differen-
tially expressed in any one of the integrated cell clusters from two species. Each DEO in 
different cell lineages was plotted using their corresponding moving averages. The DEOs 
from each cell cluster belong to different modules, yielding total eight modules from 1 to 
8. More than 95% of the cells in each cell cluster from every species were used to construct 
the smooth lineage curves basically passing the centers of each cell cluster according to the 
pre-defined lineages using Slingshot [93].
Phylogenetic trees
The phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the protein sequences for each ortholo-
gous group (Fig. 6B, C, Additional file 14). For P. trichocarpa, E. grandis, Physcomitrium 
patens, and Selaginella moellendorffii, the sequences of primary transcripts “protein_pri-
maryTranscriptOnly.fa” were used, which were downloaded from Phytozome [92]. For 
Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Marchantia polymorpha, the transcripts with the 
longest coding sequence for each gene were extracted and used. For the other species, their 
annotations do not include the information about transcript variants. Two steps of analy-
ses were used to build phylogenetic trees. First, multiple sequence alignment based on the 
input protein sequences was conducted by MAFFT [106, 107] (v7.490). The results were 
then used to construct phylogenetic trees by IQ-TREE [108–110] (v1.6.12) with ModelF-
inder for model selection [109] and UFBoot2 for ultrafast bootstrap approximation [110]. 
The output trees were visualized and converted into images by MEGA 11 [111] (v11.0.11).
