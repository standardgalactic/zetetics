CR-TWISTOR SPACES OVER MANIFOLDS WITH G2
-AND Spinp7q-STRUCTURES
DOMENICO FIORENZA AND H ˆONG VˆAN LˆE
Abstract. In 1984 LeBrun constructed a CR-twistor space over an
arbitrary conformal Riemannian 3-manifold and proved that the CR-
structure is formally integrable.
This twistor construction has been
generalized by Rossi in 1985 for m-dimensional Riemannian manifolds
endowed with a pm´1q-fold vector cross product (VCP). In 2011 Verbit-
sky generalized LeBrun’s construction of twistor-spaces to 7-manifolds
endowed with a G2-structure.
In this paper we unify and generalize
LeBrun’s, Rossi’s and Verbitsky’s construction of a CR-twistor space to
the case where a Riemannian manifold pM, gq has a VCP structure. We
show that the formal integrability of the CR-structure is expressed in
terms of a torsion tensor on the twistor space, which is a Grassmanian
bundle over pM, gq.
If the VCP structure on pM, gq is generated by
a G2- or Spinp7q-structure, then the vertical component of the torsion
tensor vanishes if and only if pM, gq has constant curvature, and the
horizontal component vanishes if and only if pM, gq is a torsion-free G2
or Spinp7q-manifold. Finally we discuss some open problems.

1. Introduction
1.1. Motivations and prior works. In his papers [BG67], [Gray69], moti-
vated by Calabi’s work on almost complex structures on S6, Gray introduced
the notion of a vector cross product (VCP for short) structure. By deﬁni-
tion, a r-fold VCP structure χ on an Euclidean vector space pV, x¨, ¨yq is a
multilinear alternating map
χ:
r
ľ
V Ñ V
such that
xχpv1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , vrq, viy “ 0 for 1 ď i ď r,
xχpv1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , vrq, χpv1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , vrqy “ }v1 ^ ¨ ¨ ¨ ^ vr}2,
where } ¨ } is the induced metric on ^rV . For a r-fold VCP χ on V , the
associated VCP-form ϕχ : Źr`1 V Ñ R is deﬁned as
(1.1.1)
ϕχpv1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , vr`1q “ xχpv1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , vrq, vr`1y,
[Gray69, (4.1)]. As a matter of notation, once a r-fold VCP is ﬁxed one
often writes v1 ˆ v2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ vr for χpv1, . . . , vrq.
Remark 1.1.2. (1) The Brown-Gray classiﬁcation [BG67] asserts that a
r-fold VCP structure exists on Rm if and only if one of the following possi-
bilities holds (i) r “ 1 and m is even; (ii) r “ m ´ 1; (iii) r “ 2 and m “ 7;
(iv) r “ 3 and m “ 8.
(2) A pm ´ 1q-fold VCP structure χ on pRm, x¨, ¨yq is deﬁned uniquely by
a given orientation on Rm.
(3) For m “ 7, r “ 2 the VCP form ϕχ is called the associative 3-form.
Its stabilizer in GLpR7q is the exceptional group G2 Ă SOp7q. For m “ 8,
r “ 3 the VCP form ϕχ is called the Cayley 4-form. Its stabilizer in GLpR8q
is the subgroup Spinp7q Ă SOp8q. The VCP structures pχ, gq in these cases
are in a 1-1 correspondence with their VCP-forms ϕχ. Given a VCP form
ϕ on a 7-manifold an explicit formula for gϕ is given in [Hitchin00, §7.1].
Similarly, given a VCP form ϕ on a 8-manifold, a formula for gϕ can be

obtained using the relation ϕ2 “ 8volgϕ and Hitchin’s method, see similar
results in [LPV08, §3].
One has an immediate notion of a r-fold VCP on a Riemannian manifold
pM, gq as a smooth TM-valued r-form χ P ΩrpM, TMq such that χpxq is
a r-fold VCP on TxM for all x P M. The corresponding VCP-form will
therefore be an element in Ωr`1pMq.
Remark 1.1.3. A VCP form ϕχ is parallel w.r.t. the Levi-Civita connection
∇LC
g
iﬀeither pMm, gq is an orientable Riemannian manifold and r “ m´1;
or m “ 2n, pM2n, gq is a K¨ahler manifold and r “ 1; or m “ 7 and pM7, gq
is a torsion-free G2-manifold and r “ 2; or m “ 8 and pM8, gq is a torsion-
free Spin(7)-manifold and r “ 3. This result singles out K¨ahler manifolds,
torsion-free G2-and Spin(7)-manifolds as important classes of Riemannian
manifolds with special holonomy [Joyce00]. Not unrelatedly, these classes
play a prominent role in calibrated geometry, string theory and M-theory,
and F-theory [Joyce07], [GS02], [BGP14].
Remark 1.1.4. The VCPs in dimension 3, 7, 8 can be expressed in terms of
algebraic operations on normed algebras. Denote by Im O the imaginary part
of the octonion algebra O. Harvey and Lawson noticed that, identifying R7
with Im O, the associative 3-form ϕχ on Im O has the following form [HL82,
(1.1), p. 113]:
(1.1.5)
ϕχpx, y, zq “ xx, yzy.
Hence the 2-fold VCP χ on Im O is deﬁned as follows [HL82, Deﬁnition B.1,
p. 145]
(1.1.6)
y ˆ z “ Im pyzq.
The restriction of this 2-fold VCP to Im H Ă Im O coincides with the 2-fold
VCP on R3 [HL82, p. 145].
The 3-fold VCP on R8 “ O can be expressed as follows [HL82, Deﬁnition
B.3, p. 145]:

The relation between complex structures and VCP structures has been
manifested also via CR-twistor spaces over manifolds endowed with a VCP
structure. In 1984 LeBrun constructed a CR-twistor space over an arbitrary
conformal Riemannian 3-manifold [LeBrun84]. LeBrun proved that the CR-
twistor space of a conformal Riemmannian 3-manifold is a CR-manifold, i.e.
the CR-structure is integrable. This twistor construction has been gener-
alized by Rossi in 1985 for m-dimensional Riemannian manifolds endowed
with a pm ´ 1q-fold VCP [Rossi85] and utilized further by LeBrun for his
proof of the formal integrability of the almost complex structure J on the
higher dimensional loop space over a Riemannian manifold pMm, gq endowed
with a pm ´ 1q-fold VCP [LeBrun93], following a similar proof by Lempert

for the weak integrability of the almost complex structure on the loop space
over a Riemannian 3-manifold [Lempert93]. In 2011 Verbitsky generalized
LeBrun’s construction of twistor-spaces to 7-manifolds endowed with the
VCP 3-forms ϕ [Verbitsky11], which subsequently has been used by him for
his proof of the formal integrability of the almost complex structure on the
loop space over a holonomy G2-manifold [Verbitsky12].
1.2. Our main results. As a ﬁrst result in this paper, we unify and gener-
alize LeBrun’s, Rossi’s construction of a CR-twistor space over a conformal
Riemannian manfold in dimension 3 and in arbitrary dimension respectively,
as well as Verbitsky’s construction of a CR-twistor space over a G2-manifold
to the case when the underlying Riemannian manifold pM, gq has a VCP
structure, see Deﬁnition 1.2.12 below. In order to state the result we need
ﬁxing notation.
Notation 1.2.1. Let pM, gq be an oriented Riemannian manifold.
‚ We denote by Gr`pr´1, Mq the Grassmannian of oriented pr´1q-planes
in TM, which we shall identify with decomposable unit pr ´ 1q-vectors in
Źr´1 TM. When no confusion is possible we will denote Gr`pr ´ 1, Mq
simply by G. We denote by π : Źr´1 TM Ñ M the natural projection, which
also induces the natural projection π : G Ñ M. For any point v P G, the
ﬁber of π : G Ñ M through v is naturally identiﬁed with the Grassmannian
Gr`pr ´ 1, TπpvqMq of oriented pr ´ 1q-planes in TπpvqM.
‚ For v P G we denote by Ev Ď TπpvqM the oriented pr ´ 1q-plane associ-
ated to v and by EK
v its orthogonal complement in TπpvqM.
The Riemannian metric g induces a natural Riemannian metric on the
vector bundle Źr´1 TM
πÑ M and so endows Źr´1 TM with the corre-
sponding Levi-Civita connection ∇LC. This induces, for any v P Źr´1 TM,
a direct sum decomposition
(1.2.2)
Tvp^r´1TMq “ ^r´1TπpvqM ‘ T hor
v
p^r´1TMq,
where
T hor
v
p^r´1TMq – TπpvqM
is the horizontal distribution in T^r´1TM w.r.t. ∇LC. Since Gr`pr ´ 1, TMq
is a ﬁber sub-bundle of the vector bundle Źr´1 TM
πÑ M, for v P G the
orthogonal decomposition (1.2.2) induces the decomposition
(1.2.3)

Notation 1.2.6. Let pMm, gq be an m-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
We denote by B the rank m ´ r ` 1 distribution on G deﬁned at a point v
of G by
(1.2.7)
Bv :“ tw P T hor
v
G| dπvpwq P EK
v Ă TπpvqMu Ď T hor

An r-fold VCP structure χ on pM, gq endows the vector spaces EK
v with a
complex structure JEK
v deﬁned by
(1.2.8)
JEK
v pzq “ χpv ^ zq,
for z P EK
v , see [FL21, Lemma 3.1], [LL07, p. 146], [Gray69, Theorem 2.6].
Since dπv : Bv Ñ EK
v is an isometry, the complex structure JEK
v induces a
complex structure Jg,χ on Bv. It is deﬁned by the equation
(1.2.9)
dπvpJg,χpwqq “ JEK
v pdπvpwqq.
Deﬁnition 1.2.10. (cf. [DT06, Deﬁnitions 1.1, 1.2, p. 3]) An almost CR-
structure on a manifold N is a pair pB, JBq consisting of a distribution
B Ď TN and of an almost complex structure JB on B. The triple pN, B, JBq
is called an almost CR-manifold.
An almost CR-structure pB, JBq on a
manifold N is said to be formally integrable if the complex distribution
B1,0 Ă B b C is involutive, i.e., rB1,0, B1,0s Ď B1,0. If pB, JBq is integrable,
then the almost CR-manifold pN, B, JBq is called a CR-manifold.
Remark 1.2.11. The condition that the almost CR-structure pB, JBq is
formally integrable can be stated completely in terms of sections of the real
vector bundle B, without going through its complexiﬁcation, as follows.
Denote by ΠB the orthogonal projection of TGr`pr ´ 1, Mq to B and by
ΓpBq the space of smooth sections of B.
(1) For any X, Y P ΓpBq one has rJBX, JBY s ´ rX, Y s P ΓpBq;
(2) For any X, Y P ΓpBq one has
ΠBprJBX, JBY s ´ rX, Y sq ´ JB ˝ ΠBprX, JBY s ` rJBX, Y sq “ 0.
In literature [Bejancu86, p. 128], [DT06, p. 4] the condition (2) is replaced
by the following condition
rJBX, JBY s ´ rX, Y s ´ JBprX, JBY s ` rJBX, Y sq “ 0,
which has meaning only if the condition (1) holds. Clearly the conditions
(1) and (2) are equivalent to the condition (1) and the classical condition
stated above.
We shall call the condition (1) the ﬁrst CR-integrability condition, and the
condition (2) the second CR-integrability condition. In Cartan geometry, the
condition (1) is also called the partial integability of a CR-structure [CS09,
p. 443].
Now we associate to each VCP-structure on a Riemannian manifold pM, gq
an almost CR-manifold as follows.

Deﬁnition 1.2.12. Let pM, g, χq be a Riemannian manifold endowed with
a VCP structure χ. The almost CR-manifold pG, B, Jg,χq consisting of the
manifold G together with the almost CR-structure given by the distribution
B and the almost complex structure Jg,χ on B deﬁned in Equations (1.2.7)
and (1.2.9) will be called the CR-twistor space over pM, g, χq.
Examples 1.2.13. (1) Let pχ, gq be a 1-fold VCP on a smooth manifold
M2n. This is equivalently an Hermitian almost complex structure on M.
In this case one has G “ M2n, the horizontal distribution B is identiﬁed
with the tangent bundle to M2n and the almost complex structure Jg,χ is
identiﬁed with the almost complex structure on M.
(2) Let pχ, gq be a pm ´ 1q-fold VCP on an oriented manifold Mm.
Then the distribution B on G is 2-dimensional and the CR-twistor structure
pG, B, Jg,χq coincides with the one constructed by LeBrun [LeBrun84] and
extended by Rossi [Rossi85].
(3) Let χ be a 2-fold VCP on pM7, gq. Then the CR-twistor structure on
G coincides with the one constructed by Verbitsky in [Verbitsky11].
Our main result in this paper concerns necessary and suﬃcient conditions
for the ﬁrst and the second CR-integrability of the CR-twistor space over
a Riemannian manifold pM, gq endowed with a VCP structure. Let ∇LC
g
denote the Levi-Civita connection on pM, gq. We say that the VCP χ is
parallel if ∇LC
g
χ “ 0.
In this paper we prove the following
Theorem 1.2.14 (Main Theorem). Let χ P Ωr`1pM, TMq be a VCP struc-
ture on a Riemannian manifold pM, gq and pG, B, Jg,χq the associated CR-
twistor space. Then there exists a tensor T P Γp^2B˚ b TGq on the total
space G such that
(1) The ﬁrst CR-integrability (1) holds if and only if for any v P G and
X, Y P Bpvq we have T vertpX, Y q “ 0 P T vertG.
(2) If pr, mq “ p1, 2nq or pm ´ 1, mq then T vert “ 0 for any pM, g, χq.
(3) If pr, mq “ p2, 7q or p3, 8q then T vert “ 0 if and only if pM, gq has
constant curvature.
(4) The second CR-integrability (2) holds, if and only if for any v P G
and X, Y P Bpvq we have T horpX, Y q “ 0 P T horG.
(5) If pr, mq “ p1, 2nq then T hor “ 0 for pM, g, χq if and only if χ is
integrable.
(6) If pr, mq “ pm ´ 1, mq then T hor “ 0 for any pM, g, χq.
(7) If pr, mq “ p2, 7q or pr, mq “ p3, 8q then T hor “ 0 if and only if χ is
parallel.
Remark 1.2.15. Parts (2&5) and (2&6) of the main theorem above com-
bined, i.e., without decomposing the CR integrability condition into two
independent conditions, are classical and we are including them only for

completeness. In particular, by combining Example 1.2.13 (1) with Exam-
ple 2.2.10(1) we recover that a Riemannian manifold pM2n, gq endowed with
a 1-fold VCP χ is a CR-manifold if and only if the almost complex structure
on M induced by χ is integrable. Part (6) is due to LeBrun, who proved that
the CR-twistor space over a Riemannian manifold pMm, gq with a pm ´ 1q
fold VCP χ is always a CR-manifold [LeBrun84], [LeBrun93]. Note that in
this case χ is always parallel, see [Gray69, Proposition 4.5]. Part (7) for the
case p2, 7q is due to Verbitsky [Verbitsky11]. Unfortunately his proof uses
a wrong argument, see Remark 2.2.9. Finally, it was also known that the
CR-twistor space over any ﬂat Riemannian manifold pM, gq endowed with
parallel VCP is a CR-manifold.
1.3. Organization of our paper. In the second section we study the ﬁrst
condition (1) for the formal integrability of the CR-twistor space over a
Riemannian manifold pM, gq endowed with a VCP-structure χ. First, using
a geometric characterization of the distribution B (Lemma 2.1.7), we ex-
press the condition (1) for the CR-twistor space over pM, g, χq in terms of
the vertical components of the Lie brackets rJBX, JBY s and rX, Y s, where
X, Y P ΓpBq, with respect to the decomposition (1.2.3) (Corollary 2.1.13).
Using this, we prove that the ﬁrst CR-integrability condition (1) for the
CR-twistor space over pM, g, χq holds if and only if the curvature Rpgq
of the underlying Riemannian manifold pM, gq is a solution of an inﬁnite
system of linear equations (Proposition 2.2.8).
Next, we study the ﬁrst
CR-integrability condition for the p2, 7q case using Proposition 2.2.8 and
computer algebra. Using these results and ad-hoc methods in Section 3, we
prove assertions (1) and (3) of Theorem 1.2.14. In Section 4 we study the
second condition (2) for the formal integrability of the CR-twistor space over
pM, g, χq using the formalism of the Fr¨ohlicher-Nijenhuis bracket (Proposi-
tion 4.1.1). Then we give the proof of Theorem 1.2.14 (4, 7). Finally we
discuss our results and some open questions. We include an Appendix con-
taining sagemath codes for solving the ﬁrst and the second CR integrability
condition in the (2, 7) case.
1.4. Notation and conventions.
‚ We keep notation in the introduction.
‚ For a vector bundle E over a manifold M and a smooth section α P ΓpEq,
we also write αx for the value αpxq to avoid possibly ugly notation like
αpxqpvq occurring, e.g, when E is the endomorphism bundle of TM and v
is a tangent vector at x.
‚ If ξ is an element in a vector space V with inner product x, y, we denote
by ξ7 the element on V ˚ deﬁned by ξ7pvq “ xξ, vy for all v P V .
‚ Given a G-action on a space X, for x P X, we denote by StabGpxq the
stabilizer of x in G.
‚ We consider in this paper the Killing metric on Lie algebra sopRnq and
any its Lie subalgebra deﬁned as follows xX, Y y “ ´ 1
2TrpXY q.

‚ Let pV, x, yq be an Euclidean vector space. We denote by ACpV q the
vector subspace of Ź2 V ˚ bsopV q consisting of elements R P Ź2 V ˚ bsopV q
that satisfy the algebraic Bianchi identity, i.e.,
Rpw1, w2qw3 ` Rpw2, w3qw1 ` Rpw3, w1qw2 “ 0,
The elements of ACpV q are called algebraic curvature (operators) on V . It
is known that dim ACpV q “
1
12pdim V q2ppdim V q2 ´ 1q [Gilkey01, Corollary
1.8.4, p. 45].
‚ It is known that the image RId of the operator Id : Ź2 V ˚ Ñ Ź2 V ˚
in Ź2 V ˚ b sopV q via the identiﬁcation Ź2 V ˚ with sopV q is an algebraic
curvature of constant sectional curvature, see. e.g. [Gilkey01, Lemma 1.6.4,
p. 31]. It is immediate to see that
(1.4.1)
RIdpw1, w2qw3 :“ xw2, w3yw1 ´ xw1, w3yw2,
for any w1, w2, w3, see [Gilkey01, p. 31]. By the Schur lemma if pM, gq is a
connected Riemannian manifold of dimension at least 3, then the Riemann-
ian curvature tensor of M is of the form R “ λpxqRId at any point x P M if
and only if pM, gq has constant curvature [KN63, Theorem 2.2, p. 202].
‚ Let DerpΩ˚pMqq be the graded Lie algebra of graded derivations of
Ω˚pMq. For K P Ω˚pM, TMq we denote by ιK and by LK “ rd, ιKs the
contraction with K and corresponding the Lie derivative, respectively. It
is known that L: Ω˚pM, TMq Ñ DerpΩ˚pMqq is injective, and moreover
[FN56a, FN56b]
LpΩ˚pM, TMqq “ tD P DerpΩ˚pMqq| rD, ds “ 0u.
Hence LpΩ˚pM, TMqq is closed under the graded Lie bracket r, s on DerpΩ˚pMqq
and one then deﬁnes the Fr¨olicher-Nijenhuis bracket r, sF N on Ω˚pM, TMq
as the pull-back of the graded Lie bracket on DerpΩ˚pMqq via the linear
embedding L, i.e.,
LrK,LsF N :“ rLK, LLs.
2. A reformulation of the first condition for the formal
integrability of CR-twistor spaces pG, B.Jg,χq
In this section we reformulate the ﬁrst condition for the integrability of
CR-twistor spaces pG, B, Jg,χq in terms of a system of linear equations for
the curvature tensor of pM, gq. This will in particular imply that the ﬁrst
integrability condition is automatically satisﬁed in the case pr, mq “ p1, 2nq
or pr, mq “ pm ´ 1, mq. The proof goes in two steps. First we express the
ﬁrst integrability condition as the condition rJg,χX, Jg,χY svert “ rX, Y svert
for any X, Y P ΓpBq (Corollary 2.1.13). Then we translate this in a system
of conditions on the curvature tensor of pM, gq (Proposition 2.2.8).

2.1. The equation rJg,χX, Jg,χY svert “ rX, Y svert. Let pM, g, χq be a Rie-
mannian manifold endowed with a r-fold VCP structure and pB, Jg,χq the
almost CR-structure on G. Let E˚ be the dual bundle of the tautological
bundle E over G. At every point v in G, the Riemannian metric g induces
a natural isomorphism Ev “ TπpvqM{EK
v , where π: G Ñ M is the projec-
tion to the base. This gives a natural identiﬁcation E˚ “ AnnpEKq, where
AnnpEKq is the vector bundle over G whose ﬁber over v consists of all ele-
ments of T ˚
πpvqM that annihilate EK
v .
Remark 2.1.1. Since E˚ is a subbundle of π˚T ˚M via the identiﬁcation
E˚ “ AnnpEKq, any θ P ΓpE˚q deﬁnes a map of ﬁber bundles over M,
(2.1.2)
ˆθ : G Ñ T ˚M,
mapping a point v P G to the element θv seen as an element in T ˚
πpvqM.
The Riemannian metric g induces a natural Riemannian metric on the
vector bundle T ˚M Ñ M and so endows T ˚M with the associated Levi-
Civita connection ∇LC and the corresponding splitting of the tangent bundle
of the total space of T ˚M into a vertical and a horizontal subbundle. The
same applies to the bundle π˚T ˚M and to its subbundle E˚.
Notation 2.1.3. For v P G we let
(2.1.4)
ΓhorpvqpE˚q :“ tθ P ΓpE˚q : dˆθpT hor
v
Gq Ă T hor
ˆθpvqT ˚Mu.
In other words, ΓhorpvqpE˚q consists of elements in ΓpE˚q that are “hori-
zontal” at v. Using parallel transport in the Grassmann bundle G Ñ M and
in the total space of the vector bundle E˚ on G seen as a ﬁber bundle over
M one easily shows that every vector ξ P E˚
v can be extended to a section
of E˚ that is horizontal at v. For later reference, we state this fact as the
following Lemma.
Lemma 2.1.5. For any ξ P E˚
v there exists an element θ P ΓhorpvqpE˚q such
that θv “ ξ.
Notation 2.1.6. We write
η: ΓpE˚q Ñ Ω1pGq,
θ ÞÑ ηrθs
for the map sending a smooth section θ of E˚ to the 1-form ηrθs given by
ηrθsvpwq “ θvpdπvpwqq,
for any w P TvG. In other words, ηrθs is the section of T ˚G Ñ G given by
the composition

(2.1.8)
ηrθsvpwq “ θvpdπvpwBqq “ 0.
Namely, by deﬁnition of Bv, equation (1.2.7), the vector dπvpwBq is in EK
v
and so it is annihilated by θv P E˚
v “ AnnpEK
v q. Vice versa, let w P TvG
be such that ηrθsvpwq “ 0 for every θ P ΓhorpvqpE˚q.
Let us write w “

exists θ P ΓhorpvqpE˚q such that θv “ ξ, and so

Therefore,

plectic form on T ˚M. From (2.1.10) we obtain
(2.1.11)
dηrθs “ ˆθ˚pωq “ ω ˝ pdˆθ ^ dˆθq.
Since θ P ΓhorpvqpE˚q, the diﬀerential dˆθ maps the horizontal space T hor

2.1.9.
□
Lemma 2.1.12. For any X, Y P ΓpBq we have
rX, Y s P ΓpB ‘K T vertGq.
Proof. Let v be a point in G. We have to show that rX, Y sv P Bv ‘K T vert
v
G.
By Lemma 2.1.7 this is equivalent to showing that for every θ P ΓhorpvqpE˚q
we have ηrθsvprX, Y svq “ 0. By the Cartan formula,
ηrθsvprX, Y svq “ ´pdηrθsqvpXv, Yvq ` XvpηrθspY qq ´ YvpηrθspXqq.
By deﬁnition of B, we have Bv Ă T hor
v
G, and so pdηrθsqvpXv, Yvq “ 0, by
Lemma 2.1.9. By deﬁnition of ΓhorpvqpE˚q, θ is in particular an element of
ΓpE˚q “ ΓpAnnpEKqq. Therefore, for any point v1 in G we have
ηrθsv1pXv1q “ θv1pdπv1pXv1qq “ 0,
since X P ΓpBq and so dπv1pXv1q P EK
v1, by the deﬁning equation (1.2.7).
This means that ηrθspXq identically vanish on G. By the same argument,
also ηrθspY q ” 0, and so we have ηrθsvprX, Y svq “ 0.

Corollary 2.1.13. Let Jg,χ the complex structure on B induced by the VCP
χ (equation (1.2.9)). For any X, Y P ΓpBq we have
rJg,χX, Jg,χY s´rX, Y s P ΓpBq if and only if rJg,χX, Jg,χY svert “ rX, Y svert.
Proof. By Lemma 2.1.12, we have rX, Y s P ΓpB ‘ T vertGq. Since Jg,χ is
an vector bundle endomorphism of B, we also have Jg,χX, Jg,χY P ΓpBq
and so by Lemma 2.1.12 again, rJg,χX, Jg,χY s P ΓpB ‘ T vertGq. This gives
rJg,χX, Jg,χY s´rX, Y s P ΓpB‘T vertGq and so rJg,χX, Jg,χY s´rX, Y s P ΓpBq
if and only if prJg,χX, Jg,χY s ´ rX, Y sqvert “ 0.

2.2. A curvature reformulation of the ﬁrst CR-integrability condi-
tion. By Corollary 2.1.13, the ﬁrst CR-integrability condition (1) is equiv-
alent to
rJg,χX, Jg,χY svert “ rX, Y svert
for any X, Y P ΓpBq. This latter condition can be conveniently expressed
in terms of the curvature operator R of the Levi-Civita connection on
pM, gq.
If X, Y are horizontal vector ﬁelds on G and v P G, we have
RπpvqpdπvpXvq, dπvpYvqq P sopTπpvqMq and so a corresponding SOpdim Mq-
invariant vertical vector ﬁeld rπpvqpdπvpXvq, dπvpYvqq on the ﬁber of G Ñ M

Proposition 2.2.8. The ﬁrst condition (1) for the CR-integrability of pB, Jg,χq
is equivalent to (2.2.6) (and so to any of the conditions in Lemma 2.2.5).
The proofs of Lemma 2.2.5 and Proposition 2.2.8 are straightforward and
therefore omitted. Detailed proofs can be found in arXiv:2203.04233v2.
Remark 2.2.9. In [Verbitsky11] Verbitsky also expresses the integrability
condition for the CR-twistor space over a Riemannian pM7, gq endowed with
an associative 3-form ϕ in terms of constraints on the curvature of the un-
derlying Riemannian manifold pM7, gq. The Condition (ii) in [Verbitsky11,
Proposition 3.2] is equivalent to our condition (2.2.7). But his assertion in
[Verbitsky11, Proposition 3.2] that this condition is equivalent to the con-
dition that Rpwi ^ wjq takes value in the Lie algebra g2 is not correct. In
fact, that assertion also contradicts a related statement in [SW17, Theorem
11.1].
Examples 2.2.10. (1) In the case pr, mq “ p1, 2nq, the vector w4 in equation
(2.2.7) is neccessarily 0, so (2.2.7) is trivially satisﬁed.
1In what follows we shall often omit “Killing” when we talk about a metric on a compact
Lie algebra.

CR-TWISTOR SPACES OVER MANIFOLDS WITH G2 -AND Spinp7q-STRUCTURES 13
(2) In the case pr, mq “ pm´1, mq, the vector space EK
v is of real dimension
m´pr ´1q “ 2. Therefore, sopEK
v q is an abelian Lie algebra and the second
condition in Lemma 2.2.5 is trivially satisﬁed.
(3) Let Ew be the oriented 2-plane in TπpvqM spanned by the ordered
basis pw3, w4q. If Rpw3, w4q P sopEwq Ă sopTxMq for any w3, w4 P TπpvqM,
then (2.2.7) is automatically satisﬁed. In the later part of this section, we
will see that for 2-fold vector cross products on 7-dimensional manifolds and
for 3-fold vector cross products on 8-dimensional manifolds the condition
Rπpvqpw3, w4q P sopEwq for the Riemannian curvature is also necessary.
It follows from Example 2.2.10 and Proposition 2.2.8 that the Condition
(1) is non-trivial only for two cases pr, mq “ p2, 7q and pr, mq “ p3, 8q.
2.3. An inﬁnite system of linear conditions for R. Equation (2.2.7)
can be interpreted as a system of linear conditions for a section of a certain
vector bundle over M.
Let V be an Euclidean space endowed with an r-fold VCP. For any w P
Gr`p2, V q let
(2.3.1)
Rw :“ tAw P sopV q| rΠsopEK
v qAw, JEK
v s “ 0u
for any v P Gr`pr ´ 1, V q with dimpEv X Ewq “ 1 and dimpEK
v X Ewq “ 1.
The following Lemma is immediate from the deﬁnition of the subspaces
Rw and Proposition 2.2.8.
Lemma 2.3.2. The ﬁrst condition (1) for the CR-integrability of the CR-
twistor space pG, B, Jg,χq over a manifold pM, g, χq holds if and only if for
any w P Gr`p2, TMq we have
Rpwq P Rw.
Remark 2.3.3. The condition dimpEv X Ewq “ 1 and dimpEK
v X Ewq “ 1
means that there exists an orthonormal frame pw1, . . . , wrq with pw2, . . . , wrq
an orthonormal basis for Ev and pw1, w2q an orthonormal basis for Ew.
Therefore, the ﬁrst integrability condition (1) holds for pM, g, χq if and only
if for any x P M, and any orthonormal frame pw1, . . . , wrq in TxM with
pw2, . . . , wrq an orthonormal basis for Ev and pw1, w2q an orthonormal basis
for Ew we have

w2^¨¨¨^wr s “ 0 P sopEK
w2^¨¨¨^wrq,
where Rgpx; ´q denotes the curvature tensor of pM, gq at the point x.
Deﬁnition 2.3.5. Let pV, x, yq be an Euclidean vector space endowed with
an r-fold VCP χ. We denote by ACCR1pV, χq Ď ACpV q the subspace of
ACpV q consisting of those elements R P ACpV q such that Rpwq P Rw, for
any w P Gr`p2, V q, i.e., such that (2.3.4) holds for any orthonormal frame
pw1, . . . , wrq in V .

Remark 2.3.6. The conditions deﬁning the subspace ACCR1pV, χq of ACpV q
are an inﬁnite system of linear equations. This is the inﬁnite system the title
of this Section alludes to.
Lemma 2.3.7. We have RId P ACCR1pV, χq.
Proof. For any orthonormal r-frame w one has ΠsopEK
w2^¨¨¨^wr qRId
w1^w2 “ 0.
Indeed, this identity is equivalent to the condition
xRIdpw1, w2qz1, z2y “ 0,
@z1, z2 P EK
w2^¨¨¨^wr
which in turn is immediate from the deﬁnition of RId (see Notation and
Conventions).
□
Corollary 2.3.8. If dim V ě 2 then dim ACCR1pV, χq ě 1.
Remark 2.3.9. If I is a set of N orthonormal r-frames in V then we can
consider the set
ACrIs
CR1pV, χq “ tR P ACpV q | rΠsopEK
w2^¨¨¨^wr qRw1^w2, JEK
w2^¨¨¨^wr s “ 0, @w P Iu.
Clearly, for any I one has ACCR1pV, χq Ď ACrIs
CR1pV, χq and so if dim V ě 2
then for any I one has 1 ď dim ACCR1pV, χq ď dim ACrIs
CR1pV, χq. This paves
the way to determining dim ACCR1pV, χq via Monte Carlo methods: one ran-
domly picks a ﬁnite subset I and computes the corresponding dimension of
ACrIs
CR1pV, χq. If this happens to be equal to 1, then one sees that necessarily
dim ACCR1pV, χq “ 1.
Proposition 2.3.10. Let V be a 7-dimensional Euclidean vector space en-
dowed with a 2-fold VCP χ. Then dim ACCR1pV, χq “ 1. In particular,
ACCR1pV, χq is spanned by RId.
Proof. The pair pV, χq can be identiﬁed with the 7-dimensional space ImO
of imaginary octonions endowed with their standard VCP. In this model one
can easily implement a Monte Carlo computation of dim ACCR1pV, χq “ 1
as descrbed in Remark 2.3.9. Implementation shows that already with 100
random points one generally obtains dim ACCR1pV, χq “ 1. A sagemath
code implementing this computation is provided and commented in the Ap-
pendix. It runs in about 50 minutes on a 2.4 Ghz 8core.
□
Denote by ˆ the 2-fold VCP on Im O, see (1.1.6).
Proposition 2.3.10
implies the following corollary immediately
Corollary 2.3.11. If R P ACCR1pIm O, ˆq then Rpwq P sopEwq for any
w P Gr`p2, Im Oq.
3. Proof of Theorem 1.2.14(1–3)
In this section we deﬁne the torsion tensor T P ΓpŹ2 B˚ b TGq on the
total space G over a Riemannian manifold pM, gq endowed with a VCP.
Then, using the results in the previous section, we give a proof of Theorem

1.2.14 (1–2) and of Theorem 1.2.14 (3) for the (2,7) case. To prove Theorem
1.2.14 (3) for the (3,8) case we reduce the Equation (2.2.7) for the case
pr, mq “ p3, 8q to the case pr, mq “ p2, 7q and utilize the symmetry of the
equation (1) as well as ad-hoc techniques.

for any v P G and any X, Y P ΓpBq. By (2.2.1), the RHS of (3.0.1) depends
only on Xpvq, Y pvq, thus T vert
v
is a well-deﬁned tensor. We verify imme-
diately, or utilize (4.1.3) below, to conclude that that the RHS of (3.0.2),
like the Nijenhuis tenor, depends only on the value Xpvq, Y pvq. Thus T is a
tensor on the manifold G. Now,
‚ Theorem 1.2.14(1) follows immediately from Corollary 2.1.13, taking
into account (3.0.1).
‚ Theorem 1.2.14(2) is Example 2.2.10 (1–2).
‚ Theorem 1.2.14(3) for the (2,7) case follows from Proposition 2.3.10,
Lemma 2.3.7, (3.0.1), noting that if dim M ě 3 then a metric g
on M which satisﬁes the condition Rgpxq “ λpxqRId is a constant
curvature metric by the Schur lemma.
To conclude the proof of Theorem 1.2.14 (3), i.e., to prove it for the (3,8)
case, we need a preparatory result.
Let χ be the 3-fold VCP on R8 “ O, see (1.1.7) and ˆ the 2-fold VCP on
R7 “ Im O, and let

It induces by restriction a map
t: ACCR1pO, χq Ñ ACCR1pIm O, ˆq.
Proposition 3.0.3. Assume that R P ACCR1pO, χq. Then for any w1^w2 P
Gr`p2, Oq we have
Rpw1 ^ w2q P sopEw1^w2q.
Proof. Since Spinp7q acts transitively on Gr`p2, Oq and the space ACCR1pO, χq
is invariant under the Spinp7q-action, it suﬃces to prove Proposition 3.0.3

16

for w1 “ i and w2 “ j. Since tpRq P ACCR1pO, ˆq, taking into account
Corollary 2.3.11, we have Rpi ^ jq P Π´1

Rpi ^ jq “ R1pi ^ jq ` R2pi ^ jq,

U “ tA P sopOq| rΠsopEK

Since R P ACCR1pO, χq, we have Rpi ^ jq P U and by Example 2.2.10 (3),
we have R1pi ^ jq P U. Therefore R2pi ^ jq P U. Now we write
R2pi^jq “ ai17 ˆbi`aj17 ˆbj`ak17 ˆbk`al17 ˆbℓ`bi17 ˆbℓi`bj17 ˆbℓj`bk17 ˆbℓk,
where recall that 17 P E˚
1 is dual to 1 in E1, and ai, aj, ak, al, bi, bi, bk, bl P R.
From [Bryant82, Proposition 2.1, p. 196] and other assertions therein one
obtains that the stabilizer StabSpinp7qpi^jq acts transitively on the product of
unit spheres S1pEi^jqˆS5pEK
i^jq so we can assume without loss of generality

This vanishes if and only if ai “ ak “ 0.
□
Theorem 1.2.14(3) in the (3,8) case now follows immediately by noticing
that the Riemannian curvature tensor R of a connected Riemannian mani-
fold pM, gq with dim M ě 3 satisﬁes Rpv, wq P sopEv^wq for any two linearly
independent tangent vectors if and only if pM, gq has constant sectional cur-
vature.2
Remark 3.0.6. Given Riemannian manifolds pM7, gq, or pM8, gq of con-
stant curvature, the existence of a VCP product on pM7, gq and pM8, gq is
equivalent to the existence of a section of the associated SOp7q{G2-bundle
over M7 and of the associated SOp8q{Spinp7q-bundle over M8, respectively.
A section of the associated SOp7q{G2-bundle over M7 exists if and only if
the manifold M7 is orientable and spinnable, i.e., equivalently, if and only
2At least the “if” assertion seems well known, see e.g. [Gilkey01, p. 31] for an equivalent
formulation, which we also utilize below. The “only if” part is an easy consequence of
Schur’s lemma for the Ricci tensor. A detailed proof can be found in arXiv:2203.04233v2.

CR-TWISTOR SPACES OVER MANIFOLDS WITH G2 -AND Spinp7q-STRUCTURES 17
if the ﬁrst and the second Stiefel-Whitney classes w1pM7q and w2pM7q of
M7 vanish, see [LM89, Theorem 10.6, Chapter IV] or [FKMS97, Proposition
3.2]. A section of the associated SOp8q{Spinp7q-bundle over M8 exists if and
only if w1pM8q “ w2pM8q “ 0 and for any choice of orientation of M8 one
has p1pM8q2 ´ 4p2pM8q ˘ 8χpM8q “ 0, where p1 and p2 are the ﬁrst two
Pontryagin classes and χ is the Euler class[GG1970, Theorem 3.4, Corollary
3.5].
A family of Spp2q-invariant G2-structure on homogeneous 7-sphere
Spp2q{Spp1q of constant curvature is given in Remark at the end of Section
2 in [LMES21]. It follows from [ACFR20] that there is no homogeneous
Spinp7q-structure on the sphere S8.
4. The second CR-integrability condition
In this section pM, g, χq is a Riemannian manifold with a VCP structure
χ and pG, B, Jg,χq is its CR-twistor space. In Subsection 4.1 we express the
second integrability condition (2) in terms of the Fr¨olicher-Nijenhuis tensor
and compute this tensor in terms of pM, g, χq in later subsections. Using
this we complete the proof of the Main Theorem 1.2.14. For this purpose,
we consider the natural metric ˜g on the total space ^r´1TM such that
(i) for any v P Źr´1 TM, T vert
v
Źr´1 TM is orthogonal to T hor
v
Źr´1 TM,
(ii) for any v P Źr´1 TM the restriction of ˜g to T vert
v
^r´1TπpvqM coincides
with the metric on Źr´1 TπpvqM deﬁned by gpπpvqq,
(iii) The projection π : pŹr´1 TM, ˜gq Ñ pM, gq is a Riemannian submer-
sion.
If r “ 2 then ˜g is the Sasaki metric on TM [Sasaki58]. Abusing notation,
we also denote by ˜g the restriction of ˜g to G. Let us extend the operator
Jg,χ : B Ñ B to an operator ˜JB : TG Ñ TG on the whole space TG by
setting
p ˜JBq|B “ Jg,χ,
p ˜JBq|BK “ 0,
where BK is the orthogonal complement to B in TG.
4.1. The second CR-integrability condition and the Fr¨olicher-Nijenhuis
tensor.
Proposition 4.1.1. The second CR-integrability condition is equivalent to
the following condition
(4.1.2)
ΠBpr ˜JB, ˜JBsF N
|B q “ 0.
Proof. By [KMS93, Corollary 8.12, p. 73], for any two vector ﬁelds X, Y on
TG we have

2r ˜JB, ˜JBsF NpX, Y qq “ ΠBpr ˜JBX, ˜JBY s´rX, Y s´ ˜JBprX, ˜JBY s`r ˜JBX, Y sqq.
Taking into account ΠB ˝ ˜JB “ ˜JB ˝ ΠB, this proves Proposition 4.1.1.

Now we are going to express Condition (4.1.2) in terms of the Levi-Civita
covariant derivative ˜∇on the Riemannian manifold pG, ˜gq. Let ˜ω be the
2-form on G deﬁned by ˜ωpX, Y q “ ˜gp ˜JBX, Y q. Equivalently, ˜ωvpX, Y q “
ϕχpv ^ dπvX ^ dπvY q. In particular, we have
(4.1.4)
˜ωvpX, Y q “ pπ˚ϕχqpZ, X, Y q
for any Z with dπvZ “ v. Notice that, by construction, ˜ωv only depends on
the horizontal parts of the tangent vectors X and Y in TvG.

4.2. The second CR-integrability condition for a 7-manifold pM, gq
with a VCP structure. Since the complex structure Jg,χ on Bpvq is given
by the vector cross product with the unit vector v, and the 2-form ˜ω is
deﬁned in terms of the 3-form ϕχ, one should expect that the expressions
appearing in (4.1.6) can be written in terms of ϕχ and of v ˆ ´. This is
precisely the content of the following Lemma.
Lemma 4.2.1. Let x be a point in M and let pv, w1, w2, w3q be a or-
thonormal quadruple in TxM such that pw1, w2, w3q is a Hermitian basis
of pEK
v , JEK
v q. Let w3`k “ v ˆ wk for k P r1, 3s. Let pe1, . . . , e6q be an or-
thonormal basis in Bpvq with wa “ dπvpeaq for a P r1, 6s. Then the following
identities hold for j, p, q P r1, 6s
ıeqpıej ˜∇Jg,χep ˜ωq “ p∇vˆwpϕχqpv, wj, wqq
(4.2.2)
ıeqpıJg,χej ˜∇ep ˜ωq “ p∇wpϕχqpv, v ˆ wj, wqq
(4.2.3)
In order to prove Lemma 4.2.1 we will need some preparation. Let v P
G “ Gr`
1 p1, Mq Ă TM. For a tangent vector X in TπpvqM, we denote by
Xh.l.|v and by Xv.l.|v the horizontal and vertical lifts of X to horizontal
and tangent vectors in TvTM. Since T hor

TM “ T hor
v
G, for any horizontal
tangent vector Y P T hor
v
G we have Y “ pdπvpY qqh.l.|v.
Lemma 4.2.4. Let v P G and let peiq be a orthonormal basis of T hor
v
G with
dπvpe7q “ v. Let w1, . . . , w6, v P TπpvqM be images of e1, . . . , e7 via dπv, and
let pWiq be the vector ﬁelds on a neighborhood U of πpvq in M corresponding
to the normal coordinates deﬁned by the exponential map expπpvq : TπpvqM Ñ
M such that Wi|πpvq “ wi for i “ 1, . . . , 6 and W7|πpvq “ v. Finally let pˆeiq be
the vector ﬁelds in the neighborhood π´1pUq of v in G deﬁned by horizontal
lifting of pWiq, i.e., ˆei|y “ W h.l
i;πpyq|y for any y P π´1pUq. Then ˆei|v “ ei and
p ˜∇ˆeiˆejqhorˇˇ
v “ 0
for any i, j P r1, 6s.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is immediate by the deﬁnition of ˆei: we have
ˆei|v “ W h.l
i;πpvq|v “ wh.l
i |v “ pdπvpeiqqh.l|v “ ei.
For the second statement, let ∇denote the Levi-Civita connection of pM, gq.
Since ∇WiWj

ately follows.

Lemma 4.2.5. In the same notation as in Lemma 4.2.4, let Z be the vector
ﬁeld on the neighborhood U of πpvq in M deﬁned by Zx “ traπpvq,xpvq, where
traπpvq,x : TπpvqM Ñ TxM is the parallel transport along the unique geodesics

π´1pUq of v in G, i.e., Hy “ Zh.l.
πpyq|y for any y P G with πpyq P U. Then
dπvpHvq “ v and
p ˜∇ˆeiHqhorˇˇ
v “ 0

Proof. The ﬁrst statement is immediate from Hv “ Zh.l.
πpvq|v “ vh.l.|v. For the
second statement, since Z is deﬁned by parallel transport along geodesics
stemming from πpvq and the vector ﬁelds Wi correspond to normal coor-
dinates at πpvq, we have ∇WiZ
ˇˇ
πpvq “ 0, where ∇denotes the Levi-Civita
connection on M. The conclusion then follows from [GK02, Proposition 7.2
(i)], by the same reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 4.2.4.
□
Proof of Lemma 4.2.1. By assumption, the triple pe1, e2, e3q is a Hermitian
basis of pBpvq, Jg,χq, so that setting e4 “ Jg,χe1, e5 “ Jg,χe2 and e6 “ Jg,χe3
we obtain a orthonormal basis for Bpvq. We complete it to a orthonormal
basis for T hor

G by adding a horizontal vector e7 with dπvpe7q “ v. Let us
also write

as there, we have p ˜∇ˆeiˆejqhorˇˇ

so we have ﬁnally found

This proves (4.2.2). The proof of (4.2.3) is analogue.
□
From (4.1.6) and Lemma 4.2.1 we get the following.
Lemma 4.2.6. The second CR-integrability holds for pGr`p1, M7q, B, Jg,χq
if and only if for any x P M, v P G and some (and hence any) Hermitian
basis w1, w2, w3 of pEK
v , JEK
v q the following conditions hold
p∇vˆwqϕχqpv, wj, wpq ´ p∇vˆwpϕχqpv, wj, wqq
`p∇wqϕχqpv, v ˆ wj, wpq ´ p∇wpϕχqpv, v ˆ wj, wqq “ 0
(4.2.7)
for any j, p, q P r1, 6s, where w3`k “ v ˆ wk for k P r1, 3s.
Deﬁnition 4.2.8. Let V be a 7-dimensional Euclidean space endowed with
a 2-fold vector cross product ˆ. The space of algebraic intrinsic torsions
for pV, ˆq is the subspace T pV q of V ˚ b Ź3 V ˚ consisting of those elements
A such that Apη1; η2 ^ η3 ^ pη2 ˆ η3qq “ 0 for any η1, η2, η3 P V .
The
G2-invariant subspace TCR2pV q of T pV q is deﬁned as the subspace of T pV q
consisting of those elements A such that for any v P Gr`p1, V q and some
(and hence any) Hermitian basis w1, w2, w3 of pEK
v , JEK
v q the condition
Apv ˆ wq; v ^ wj ^ wpq ´ Apv ˆ wp; v ^ wj ^ wqq
`Apwq; v ^ pv ˆ wjq ^ wpq ´ Apwp; v ^ pv ˆ wjq ^ wqq “ 0
(4.2.9)
holds for any j, p, q P r1, 6s, where w3`k “ v ˆ wk for k P r1, 3s.
Lemma 4.2.10. We have dimpT pV qq “ 49 and dimpTCR2pV qq “ 0.
Proof. It is well known that dimpT pV qq “ 49 [FG82, Lemma 4.1]. Then
(4.2.9) imposes an inﬁnite system of linear equations on T pV qq, parametrized
by quadruples pv, w1, w2, w3q as in the statement of the Lemma. These are

22
DOMENICO FIORENZA AND H ˆONG VˆAN LˆE
obviously not linearly independent. Yet it turns out that it is generally suf-
ﬁcient to sample ten random quadruples to impose 49 linearly independent
equations. A sagemath code doing this is provided in the Appendix. It runs
in about 1 hour on a 2.4 Ghz 8core.
□
Remark 4.2.11. Fernandez and Gray provide in [FG82] an explicit de-
composition of T pV q into a orthogonal direct sum of four irreducible G2
representations, of dimensions, 1, 7, 14, 27, respectively. It is likely that
working with these and with standard basis quadruples in pImpOq, ˆq one
can obtain dimpTCR2pV qq “ 0 by imposing by hand a suitable subset of the
equations (4.2.9) without relying on computer algebra. This would however
presumably take much more than an hour to be done.
Proposition 4.2.12. The second CR-integrability condition holds for a 2-
fold VCP structure pg, χq on a 7-manifold M7 if and only if the VCP struc-
ture pg, χq is parallel.
Proof. Immediate from Lemmas 4.2.6 and 4.2.10.
□
4.3. The second CR-integrability for a 8-manifold pM, gq with a
VCP structure. The analysis of the second CR-integrability for a 8-manifold
pM, gq with a VCP structure goes precisely along the same lines as for the
7-dimensional case. The only change is that now v is an orthonormal frame
representing an element in G “ Gr`p2, Mq instead of a unit vecor represent-
ing an element in Gr`p1, Mq. With the same proof, we have the following
8-dimensional analogue of Lemma 4.2.6.
Proposition 4.3.1. The second CR-integrability holds for pGr`p2, M8q, B, Jg,χq
if and only if for any x P M, v P G and some (and hence any) Hermitian
basis w1, w2, w3 of pEK
v , JEK
v q the following conditions hold
p∇vˆwqϕχqpv ^ wj ^ wpq ´ p∇vˆwpϕχqpv ^ wj ^ wqq
`p∇wqϕχqpv ^ pv ˆ wjq ^ wpq ´ p∇wpϕχqpv ^ pv ˆ wjq ^ wqq “ 0
(4.3.2)
for any j, p, q P r1, 6s, where w3`k “ v ˆ wk for k P r1, 3s.
Theorem 1.2.14(7) for the (3,8) case can then be proved by the following
reduction argument. First we recall that for any x P M8, one has p∇ϕχqx P
WpTxMq Ă TxM˚ b Ź4 TxM˚, where
WpV q “ tA P V ˚ b

given by
A|EK
ξ pη1; η2 ^ η3 ^ η4q :“ Apη1; ξ ^ η2 ^ η3 ^ η4q.
Let us denote by WCR2pV q the subspace of WpV q consisting of those ele-
ments A such that for any v P Gr`p2, V q and some (and hence any) Her-
mitian basis w1, w2, w3 of pEK
v , JEK
v q the condition
Apv ˆ wq; v ^ wj ^ wpq ´ Apv ˆ wp; v ^ wj ^ wqq
`Apwq; v ^ pv ˆ wjq ^ wpq ´ Apwp; v ^ pv ˆ wjq ^ wqq “ 0
(4.3.3)
holds for any j, p, q P r1, 6s, where w3`k “ v ˆ wk for k P r1, 3s.
It is
straightforward to check that the restriction operator induces a restriction
operator

EK
ξ : WCR2pV q Ñ TCR2pEK

By Lemma 4.2.10 we therefore have that if A P WCR2pV q, then A|EK

for any ξ, and this means A “ 0.
5. Conclusions and final remarks
(1) In this paper we uniﬁed and extended the construction of a CR-twistor
space by LeBrun, Rossi and Verbitsky respectively, to the case when the
underlying Riemannian manifold admits a VCP structure. We solved the
question of the formal integrability of the CR-structure on the twistor space,
recovering the results by LeBrun and Rossi respectively, and correcting the
result by Verbitsky.
(2) We expressed the formal integrability of a CR-structure in terms of
a torsion tensor on the underlying space. Our method can be applied for
expressing the formal integrability of a CR-structure pB, JBq on a smooth
manifold M as follows. First we pick up any complement BK of B in TM.
Then we choose a metric g on M such that (i) BK is orthogonal to B, (ii)
g|B is a Hermitian metric with respect to JB.
Denote by ΠBK and ΠB
the orthogonal projections to BK and B respectively.

Then the CR-structure is formally integrable if and only if T vanishes. More
precisely, the ﬁrst CR-integrability condition for pB, JBq holds if and only

the tensor T vert vanishes and the second CR-integrability condition holds if
and only if the tensor T hor that vanishes. Note that the integrability of a
CR-structure has been investigated from the point of views of integrability
and formal integrability of G-structures, see [DT06, §1.6.1, Theorem 1.14]
for a detailed discussion.
They also showed that the intergrability of a
CR-structure, viewed as a G-structure, implies that the associated Levi
form vanishes [DT06, p. 71], see also [BHLN20, p.76]. We would like to
mention that our expression of the integrability of a CR-structure in terms
of the vertical and horizontal component of a torsion tensor is reminiscent to
O’Brian- Rawnsley’s expression of the Nijenhuis tensor of an almost complex
structure on certain twistor spaces in terms of the curvature and torsion
tensor of the associated connection [OR85].
(3) The characterization of metric of constant curvature on a Riemannian
manifold of dimension at least 3 used at the end of the proof of Theorem
1.2.14(3) can be reformulated in terms of representation theory by saying
that, given w0 P Gr`p2, Rnq and R P ACpRnq, if for any γ P SOpnq, n ě 3
(5.0.1)
γ˚Rpw0q P sopEw0q
then R “ λRId for some λ P R. The whole statement of Theorem 1.2.14(3)
can be reformulated in a similar way: given w0 P Gr`p2, Rnq and R P
ACpRnq, n “ 7 or n “ 8, if for any γ P G2 or γ P Spinp7q respectively, we
have
(5.0.2)
γ˚Rpw0q P Rω0 Ă sopRnq,
where Rω0 is the linear subspace of sopRnq deﬁned by (2.3.1), then R “
λRId. Using representation theory, it is not hard to see that the space of
G2-invariant algebraic curvatures on R7 has dimension 1 and the space of
Spinp7q-invariant algebraic curvature on R8 also has dimension 1. Thus the
equations (5.0.2) has only invariant solutions. It would be interesting to ﬁnd
a proof using only representation theory for Theorem 1.2.14(3) in the (2,7)
case. For this case, one can compute that the dimension of Rω in the RHS
of (5.0.2) is 10.
(4) Like in the (2,7) case, also in the (3,8) case Theorem 1.2.14 (3) can
be proved by directly using computer algebra, but this takes much longer
machine time with respect to the 7-dimensional case (approximatively 11
hours on a 2.4 Ghz 8core). One could shorten the machine time by investing
human time on writing code for decomposition of the space of algebraic
curvatures as G2 -and Spinp7q-modules.
(5) We gave a new characterization of torsion-free G2 and Spinp7q-structures.
As we noted in Remark 4.2.11, it would be interesting to ﬁnd a proof of
Lemma 4.2.10 which would be only based on representation theory.

Appendix: A code for the CR conditions on a 7-dimensional
manifold with VCP
To begin with, we deﬁne the command randomorthogononal2. It pro-
duces a random element in Op7q with rational entries as follows: two random
6-dimensional vectors with entries in t0, 1u are generated and stereograph-
ically projected on S7 so to produce two unit vectors in R7. Then we pro-
duce the orthogonal reﬂections with respect to the orthogonal hyperplanes
to these two vectors and multiply them. Elements in SOp7q obtained as the
multiplication of two reﬂections are general enough so that their ﬁrst two
columns can be an arbitrary orthonormal pair in R7. The pairs we produce
are not uniformly distributed on the Stiefel manifold of pairs of orthonor-
mal vectors in R7, but for our aims this is not important. For later use we
also deﬁne the orthogonal projection on the hyperplane orthogonal to a unit
vector in R7.

Next we impose the algebraic curvature equations on the set of variables
Rijkl giving the coeﬃcients of a 4-index tensor in R7. We collect all these
equations in a list of equations named listone and we extract the matrix of
coeﬃcients of the linear system given by the algebraic curvature equations in
the variables Rijkl and call this matrix MAC. In order to extract this matrix
we use the fact that the coeﬃcient ak of the variable xk in the linear equation
aixi is ak “ Bxkpaixiq. To check we have correctly implemented the algebraic
curvature equations we compare the dimension of the space of solution of
the algebraic curvature equations obtained from the rank of the matrix MAC
with the dimension given by [Gilkey01, Corollary 1.8.4, p. 45], ﬁnding they
match.

Now we implement the ﬁrst CR condition for a triple pw1, w2, w1q where
pw1, w2q is a random orthonormal pair in ImpOq.
To begin with we im-
plement the bilinear function w1 b w2 ÞÑ w1iw2jRijkl. Since the random
orthonormal pairs we produce have rational coeﬃcients with respect to the
standard basis of R7, also all of the matrices corresponding to curvature
operators, projections and complex multiplications associated with these
pairs will have rational coeﬃcients. Since the equations deﬁning the ﬁrst
CR condition are linear in the variables Rijkl, it will be computationally
convenient to multiply these matrices by a suitable integer to get rid of the
denominators. To achieve this we collect the denominator appearing into
a vector of rational numbers in the list of integers denominators. Finally,
we produce a list of 100 random ﬁrst CR conditions. Each time we pick a
random pair pw1, w2q of orthonormal unit vectors in R7, we write the left
hand side of the ﬁrst CR equation rΠsopEK
w2qRw1^w2, JEK
w2s “ 0 in the form
ΠsopEK
w2qRw1^w2JEK
w2 ´ JEK
w2ΠsopEK
w2qRw1^w2 and multiply it by a suitable
nonzero integer to get rid of the denominators. We collect all of these linear
equations into a list and extract the matrix of coeﬃcients in the variables
Rikl as above. We denote the this matrix by MCR. We join the matrices MAC
and MCR into a single matrix M. This matrix is the matrix of coeﬃcients of
the linear system consisting of the algebraic curvature equations (ﬁxed) to-
gether with 100 random ﬁrst CR equations. Finally, we compute the rank of
this matrix to determine the dimension of the space of algebraic curvatures
satisfying the 100 random ﬁrst CR equations. This is an upper bound for
the dimension of the space of algebraic curvatures satisfying all of the ﬁrst
CR equations.

One can write a code solving the ﬁrst CR condition on R8 in essentially
the same way: one uses the 4-form
e0123 ` e0145 ` e0167 ` e0246 ´ e0257 ´ e0347 ´ e0356
` e4567 ` e2367 ` e2345 ` e1357 ´ e1346 ´ e1256 ´ e1247
to deﬁne the 3-fold VCP on R8 and uses the multiplication of three reﬂections
to produce random orthonormal triples in R8. We omit the details.
Now, we provide a code implementing the second CR condition on R7.
It uses a few of the functions deﬁned in the code implementing the second
CR condition that are not repeated here. The strategy is very similar to
what we did for the ﬁrst CR condition. First we impose the antisymmetry
conditions on the structure constants Aijkl of an element in Â4 V ˚, where
V “ R7, in order to have it be an element in V ˚ b Ź3 V ˚. As a check, at

Finally we produce 10 random orthonormal bases pw1, w2, w3, w4, w5, w6, vq
with pw1, w2, w3q a Hermitian basis with respect to J ´v “ vˆ´. To do this,
we ﬁrst produce a random orthonormal basis pu1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7q; then
using a reﬂection (if needed) we change the third vector into u1 ˆ u2, while
keeping u1 and u2 ﬁxed. This way we obtain a orthonormal basis of the form
pu1, u2, u1ˆu2, ˜u4, ˜u5, ˜u6, ˜u7q. We set w1 “ u1, w2 “ u2, w3 “ u1ˆu2, v “ ˜u7
and w4 “ vˆw1, w5 “ vˆw2, w6 “ vˆw3. Next we implement the equations
deﬁning TCR1pV q for each of these 7-ples and print the dimension of the
space of solutions. Since in the ﬁrst part of the code the reﬂection matrix
was deﬁned only when the input was a norm one vector, we implement at
the beginning of the code here its version for arbitrary nonzero vectors.
