Abstract
We study the special algebraic properties of alternating 3-forms in 6 and 7
dimensions and introduce a diﬀeomorphism-invariant functional on the space
of diﬀerential 3-forms on a closed manifold M in these dimensions. Restricting
the functional to a de Rham cohomology class in H3(M, R), we ﬁnd that a
critical point which is generic in a suitable sense deﬁnes in the 6-dimensional
case a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle and in 7 dimensions a
Riemannian manifold with holonomy G2. This approach gives a direct method
of showing that an open set in H3(M, R), with a special geometry, is a local
moduli space for these structures.

Introduction
This paper arose from the author’s interest in the geometry of 3-forms on a manifold.
Exterior diﬀerential forms of degree 2 are much studied, in particular a symplectic
manifold is deﬁned by a closed non-degenerate 2-form. Our starting point here is the
fact that in dimensions 6 and 7 the notion of non-degeneracy for three-forms makes
sense too. By this we mean that if W is a real vector space of dimension 6 or 7,
1

then the group GL(W) has an open orbit, a fact that has been known for nearly a
century [12]. The orbits we are particularly interested in have stabilizer conjugate
to SL(3, C) when dim W = 6, and the exceptional Lie group G2 when dim W = 7.
In this way a single 3-form Ωon a manifold M deﬁnes a reduction of the structure
group of M to one of these groups. When we look closely at the mechanism for this
reduction, there appears naturally a volume form algebraically deﬁned by any 3-form.
Integrating this form gives a diﬀeomorphism-invariant functional Φ on the space of
3-forms, and this is our main object of study.
Following the analogy with Hodge theory, we restrict this functional to closed forms on
M in a given de Rham cohomology class and look for critical points. What we ﬁnd is
that if the critical point Ωis a 3-form which lies in the open orbit everywhere, then the
reduction of structure group is integrable in the sense that for dim M = 6 we obtain
a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle, and for dim M = 7 a Riemannian
manifold with holonomy in G2. These geometrical structures are therefore simply
critical points of the invariant functionals.
Because the functional is diﬀeomorphism-invariant, every critical point lies on an
orbit of critical points and so Φ is never a Morse function. However, we show that
formally it is a Morse-Bott function – its Hessian is non-degenerate transverse to the
orbits of Diﬀ(M). In the 6-dimensional case this requires the assumption that the
complex threefold satisﬁes the ∂¯∂-lemma, and in the G2 case we need an analogue of
this lemma, which is essentially contained in [7]. This nondegeneracy can be used,
together with a standard use of the Banach space implicit function theorem, to give
a direct and easy proof that the moduli space of complex structures together with
holomorphic 3-forms on a 6-manifold is locally an open set in H3(M, R). In particular
we see that the moduli space of complex structures is unobstructed. The novelty of
our approach is that the ﬂat structure on this moduli space is apparent from the
very beginning, and the complex structure is deﬁned in a secondary manner. This is
the opposite point of view from the conventional use of Kodaira-Spencer theory as in
the work of Tian and Todorov [14],[15]. For us the complex structure on the moduli
space carries with it the natural special pseudo-K¨ahler structure whose existence is an
important ingredient in mirror symmetry [2]. We carry out the same process for G2-
manifolds and show that the moduli space is isomorphic to an open set in H3(M, R)
with an indeﬁnite metric of Hessian type, completing a line of thought due to Joyce
[7].
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we consider the linear algebra of
the vector space Λ3W ∗where W is 6-dimensional. The essential point is that over the
complex numbers, a generic 3-form is the sum of two decomposable ones. In Section
3, we see this algebra from the point of view of symplectic geometry, regarding Λ3W ∗
2

as a symplectic vector space under the action of SL(W). This viewpoint is extremely
useful for studying the variational problem. Section 4 is a detour into the realm of self-
duality. With an inner product of signature (5, 1) on W, we can deﬁne self-dual and
anti-self-dual 3-forms, and some of the linear algebra assumes a much more concrete
form. Moreover, we see a setting here for the equation of motion for a self-interacting
self-dual tensor, a nonlinear equation of some current interest to physicists. In Section
5 we introduce the invariant functional on 3-forms on a 6-manifold, and relate the
critical points to integrable complex structures. In Section 6 we prove Morse-Bott
nondegeneracy formally, and then use a Sobolev space model to prove rigorously that
an open set in H3(M, R) is a local moduli space. Section 7 is concerned with carrying
out the parallel programme for G2-manifolds.
The author wishes to thank Robert Bryant for explaining the algebra behind SL(3, C)
and G2 and Patrick Baier for useful discussions.

Linear algebra
2.1
The complex case
Let V be a 6-dimensional complex vector space and Λ3V ∗the 20-dimensional vector
space of alternating multilinear 3-forms on V . Take Ω∈Λ3V ∗and v ∈V and the
interior product ι(v)Ω∈Λ2V ∗. Then ι(v)Ω∧Ω∈Λ5V ∗. On the other hand, the
natural exterior product pairing V ∗⊗Λ5V ∗→Λ6V ∗provides an isomorphism
A : Λ5V ∗∼= V ⊗Λ6V ∗
and using this we deﬁne a linear transformation KΩ: V →V ⊗Λ6V ∗by
KΩ(v) = A(ι(v)Ω∧Ω)
(1)
Deﬁnition 1 Deﬁne λ(Ω) ∈(Λ6V ∗)2 by
λ(Ω) = 1
6 tr K2
Ω
Using λ(Ω) we have the following characterization of “non-degenerate” elements in
Λ3V ∗:
3

Proposition 1 For Ω∈Λ3V ∗, λ(Ω) ̸= 0 if and only if Ω= α + β where α, β are
decomposable and α ∧β ̸= 0. The 3-forms α, β are unique up to ordering.
Proof:
Let v1, . . . , v6 be a basis of V and θ1, . . . , θ6 ∈V ∗the dual basis. Take
ϕ = θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 + θ4 ∧θ5 ∧θ6.
Let ǫ = θ1 ∧. . . ∧θ6 be the associated basis vector for Λ6V ∗. We ﬁnd easily that
Kϕvi = viǫ
(i = 1, 2, 3),
Kϕvi = −viǫ
(i = 4, 5, 6),
(2)
and
λ(ϕ) = ǫ2
(3)
Now if Ω= α+β where α, β are decomposable then α = ξ1∧ξ2∧ξ3 and β = η1∧η2∧η3
and the condition α ∧β ̸= 0 implies that {ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, η1, η2, η3} forms a basis for V ∗.
Thus by an element of GL(V ), Ωcan be transformed to ϕ. Since λ(ϕ) is non-zero
from (3), so is λ(Ω).
If we transform ϕ by Kϕ we ﬁnd
K∗
ϕϕ = (θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 −θ4 ∧θ5 ∧θ6)ǫ3
and so
K∗
ϕϕ + ǫ3ϕ = 2(θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3)ǫ3
Thus we see that K∗
ϕϕ + λ(ϕ)3/2ϕ ∈Λ3V ∗⊗(Λ6V ∗)3 is decomposable, for each choice
of square root of λ(ϕ). Moreover, we have
K∗
ϕϕ ∧ϕ = 2ǫ4 = 2λ(ϕ)2
(4)
Let G ⊂GL(V ) be the stabilizer of ϕ. Each element of G commutes with Kϕ and
so preserves or interchanges the two subspaces spanned by v1, v2, v3 and v4, v5, v6
respectively. The identity component G0 preserves them, and the nonvanishing 3-
forms θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 and θ4 ∧θ5 ∧θ6 deﬁned on them, and so is isomorphic to a subgroup
of SL(3, C) × SL(3, C). Thus
dim G0 ≤dim(SL(3, C) × SL(3, C)) = 16.
But dim GL(V ) = 36 so the dimension of the orbit is at least 36 −16 = 20.
Since dim Λ3V ∗= 20, the orbit is open and the stabilizer must actually be equal
to SL(3, C) × SL(3, C).
4

For the converse, note that the algebraic condition (4) and the decomposability of
K∗
ΩΩ+ λ(Ω)3/2Ωhold on the open orbit and therefore hold everywhere.
Thus in
general we have decomposable (possibly zero) forms α, β ∈Λ3V ∗with
λ(Ω)3/2Ω+ K∗
ΩΩ
=
2λ(Ω)3/2α
λ(Ω)3/2Ω−K∗
ΩΩ
=
2λ(Ω)3/2β
and so if λ(Ω) ̸= 0
Ω= α + β,
K∗
ΩΩ= λ(Ω)3/2(α −β)
(5)
From (4), K∗
ΩΩ∧Ω= 2λ(Ω)2 ̸= 0 but also from (5)
K∗
ΩΩ∧Ω= 2λ(Ω)3/2α ∧β
so α ∧β ̸= 0 as required.
By construction, α and β are unique given the choice of square root of λ(Ω).
✷
Remark:
The proposition tells us that the open set λ(Ω) ̸= 0 is the orbit of the
3-form ϕ = θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 + θ4 ∧θ5 ∧θ6 under the action of GL(V ). We can therefore
deduce properties of Ωfrom those of ϕ. For example, from (2) and (3) it follows that
tr KΩ
=
0
(6)
K2
Ω
=
λ(Ω)1
(7)
2.2
The real case
Now suppose that W is a real 6-dimensional vector space and Ω∈Λ3W ∗. In this
case λ(Ω) ∈(Λ6W ∗)2 is real. If L is a real one-dimensional vector space, we say that
a vector u ∈L ⊗L = L2, is positive (u > 0) if u = s ⊗s for some s ∈L and negative
if −u > 0.
Proposition 2 Suppose that λ(Ω) ̸= 0 for Ω∈Λ3W ∗. Then
• λ(Ω) > 0 if and only if Ω= α+β where α, β are real decomposable 3-forms and
α ∧β ̸= 0
• λ(Ω) < 0 if and only if Ω= α + ¯α where α ∈Λ3(W ∗⊗C) is a complex
decomposable 3-form and α ∧¯α ̸= 0
5

Proof:
Let V = W ⊗C be the complexiﬁcation of W.
From Proposition 1,
Ω= α + β for decomposable complex 3-forms. Since Ωis real, and α, β are unique
up to ordering, complex conjugation must preserve the pair and there are only two
possibilities: either α and β are both real or β = ¯α.
To decide which holds, recall that the deﬁnition of α and β in the proof of the
proposition was
Ω+ λ(Ω)−3/2K∗
ΩΩ
=
2α
Ω−λ(Ω)−3/2K∗
ΩΩ
=
2β
Thus if λ(Ω) > 0, λ(Ω)1/2 is real and α and β are real, and if λ(Ω) < 0, the square
root is imaginary and α and β are complex conjugate.
✷
We deduce from Proposition 2 that if Ωis real and λ(Ω) > 0, then it lies in the
GL(W) orbit of
ϕ = θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 + θ4 ∧θ5 ∧θ6
for a basis θ1, . . . , θ6 of W ∗, and if λ(Ω) < 0 in the orbit of
ϕ = α + ¯α,
α = (θ1 + iθ2) ∧(θ3 + iθ4) ∧(θ5 + iθ6)
(8)
Thus the 20-dimensional real vector space Λ3W ∗contains an invariant quartic hyper-
surface λ(Ω) = 0 which divides Λ3W ∗into two open sets: λ(Ω) > 0 and λ(Ω) < 0.
The identity component of the stabilizer of a 3-form lying in the former is conjugate
to SL(3, R) × SL(3, R) and in the latter to SL(3, C).
Choose now an orientation on W: this is a class of bases for the one-dimensional
vector space Λ6W ∗. We then have a distinguished ordering of α and β or α and ¯α,
by the condition that α ∧β or iα ∧¯α lies in the orientation class.
Deﬁnition 2 Let W be oriented and Ω∈Λ3W ∗be such that λ(Ω) ̸= 0. Then, writing
Ωin terms of decomposables ordered by the orientation, we deﬁne ˆΩ∈Λ3W ∗by
• if λ(Ω) > 0, and Ω= α + β then ˆΩ= α −β
• if λ(Ω) < 0, and Ω= α + ¯α then ˆΩ= i(¯α −α).
Note that ˆˆΩ= −Ωin both cases. The complementary 3-form ˆΩhas the deﬁning
property that if λ(Ω) > 0 then Ω+ ˆΩis decomposable and if λ(Ω) < 0, the complex
form Ω+ iˆΩis decomposable.
6

In this paper we shall be mainly concerned with the open set
U = {Ω∈Λ6W ∗: λ(Ω) < 0}
As we have seen, the stabilizer of Ω∈U is conjugate to SL(3, C) so U is just the
homogeneous space GL+(6, R)/SL(3, C). This is the space of complex structures on
R6 together with a complex-linear 3-form. Here it appears, exceptionally, not as a
homogeneous space but as an open set in a vector space. In concrete terms, the real
3-form Ωdetermines the structure of a complex vector space with a complex 3-form
on the real vector space W as follows.
From (7) we have K2
Ω= λ(Ω)1 so if λ(Ω) < 0, we deﬁne the complex structure IΩon
W by
IΩ=
1
p
−λ(Ω)
KΩ
(9)
The real 3-form Ωis then the real part of the complex form of type (3, 0)
Ωc = Ω+ iˆΩ
(10)
We also have
Ω∧ˆΩ= 2
p
−λ(Ω)
(11)
These statements can be proved simply by checking for ϕ in (8) since U is an orbit.
We have described here the linear algebra of 3-forms in 6 dimensions. It will be useful
also to describe the same objects in symplectic terms, which we shall do next.

Symplectic geometry
3.1
The moment map
Choose a non-zero vector ǫ ∈Λ6W ∗, and consider the group of linear transformations
SL(W) ⊂GL(W) preserving ǫ.
First note that Λ3W ∗is a symplectic vector space with the symplectic form ω deﬁned
by
ω(Ω1, Ω2)ǫ = Ω1 ∧Ω2 ∈Λ6W ∗
(12)
This is invariant under the action of SL(W), which is simple, and so we have a well-
deﬁned moment map µ : Λ3W ∗→sl(W)∗where sl(W), the Lie algebra of SL(W),
is the space of trace zero endomorphisms of W. If we identify the Lie algebra sl(W)
with its dual using the bi-invariant form tr(XY ), then we can characterize the linear
transformation KΩdeﬁned in (1) as follows:
7

Proposition 3 The moment map for SL(W) acting on Λ3W ∗is given by
µ(Ω) = KΩ.
Proof:
If V is a symplectic vector space with symplectic form ω, the Lie algebra
sp(V ) of Sp(V ) is Sym2(V ∗) the space of homogeneous quadratic polynomials on V .
This is the space of Hamiltonian functions for sp(V ). Concretely, given a ∈sp(V ),
we have the corresponding function
µa(v) = ω(a(v), v)
(13)
and the moment map µ is deﬁned by
tr(µ(v)a) = µa(v)
In our case a ∈sl(W) deﬁnes ρ(a) ∈sp(Λ3W ∗) via the exterior power representation
and from (12) and (13)
µa(Ω)ǫ = ρ(a)Ω∧Ω
Using a basis w1, . . . , w6 of W and its dual basis θ1, . . . , θ6 we write
a =
X
i,j
ai
jwi ⊗θj
and then the Lie algebra action is
ρ(a)Ω=
X
i,j
ai
jθj ∧ι(wi)Ω
(14)
so that
ρ(a)Ω∧Ω=
X
i,j
ai
jθj ∧ι(wi)Ω∧Ω
(15)
But from the deﬁnition of KΩin (1),
θ ∧ι(w)Ω∧Ω= θ(KΩ(w))ǫ
for any θ ∈W ∗so from (15),
ρ(a)Ω∧Ω=
X
i,j
ai
jθj(KΩ(wi)) = tr(aKΩ)
which proves the proposition.
✷

Remark:
Note that λ(Ω), which (by trivializing Λ6W ∗with ǫ) is now an SL(W)-
invariant function, is just given by
λ(Ω) = 1
6 tr(µ(Ω)2)
and thus λ(Ω) has a natural symplectic interpretation. Its exceptional property is
that SL(W) acts transitively on the generic hypersurface tr(µ(Ω)2) = const. If we
ask this of a general symplectic representation we obtain a ﬁnite list of possibilities
which appears in the classiﬁcation of symplectic holonomy groups in [10]. This is the
symplectic analogue of the fact that irreducible Riemannian holonomy groups are the
compact groups which act transitively on spheres. We hope to study the analogous
special geometry associated to these other cases in subsequent papers.
3.2
The Hamiltonian function φ
The symplectic form restricts to the open set U to deﬁne the structure of a symplectic
manifold. On U, λ(Ω) < 0, and we deﬁne
φ(Ω) =
p
−λ(Ω)
so that φ is a smooth function here, homogeneous of degree 2. We can then rewrite
(9) as
KΩ= φIΩ
and (11) as
Ω∧ˆΩ= 2φǫ
(16)
Note that from (16) we have
2φ(ˆΩ)ǫ = ˆΩ∧ˆˆΩ= −ˆΩ∧Ω= Ω∧ˆΩ
and so
φ(ˆΩ) = φ(Ω).
The function φ deﬁnes a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xφ on U. Since U is an open set
in the vector space Λ3W ∗, we may consider the vector ﬁeld as a function
Xφ : U →Λ3W ∗
and then we have:
9

Proposition 4 Let Ω7→ˆΩbe the transformation of Deﬁnition 2, then
Xφ(Ω) = −ˆΩ.
Proof:
Write Ω= α + ¯α in terms of complex decomposables. Then from (16)
2φǫ = Ω∧ˆΩ= 2iα ∧¯α
and so
˙φǫ = i ˙α ∧¯α + iα ∧˙¯α
(17)
Now if α = θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 is a smooth curve of decomposables, on diﬀerentiation we see
that
˙α = ˙θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 + θ1 ∧˙θ2 ∧θ3 + θ1 ∧θ2 ∧˙θ3
and so ˙α ∧α = 0. Hence
ω(i(α −¯α), ˙α + ˙¯α)ǫ = i(α −¯α) ∧( ˙α + ˙¯α) = i ˙α ∧¯α + iα ∧˙¯α
and so from (17) we can write
˙φǫ = ω(i(α −¯α), ˙α + ˙¯α)ǫ = −ω(ˆΩ, ˙Ω)ǫ
Since the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is deﬁned by the property ι(Xφ)ω = dφ we have
our result.
✷
Remark:
If we regard U as parametrizing complex structures on W together with
(3, 0) forms then we have an obvious circle action Ω+ iˆΩ7→eiθ(Ω+ iˆΩ). The real
point of view we are following here describes this as an action on the real parts which
is
Ω7→cos θ Ω−sin θ ˆΩ
and diﬀerentiating at θ = 0 we see that this action is generated by the vector ﬁeld
Xφ = −ˆΩ. The position vector (or Euler vector ﬁeld) Ωintegrates to give the R∗-
action Ω7→λΩand the two deﬁne the action of multiplying the complex form Ω+iˆΩ
by C∗.
3.3
The complex structure on U
Proposition 5 The derivative J = DXφ ∈End(Λ3W ∗) of Xφ : U →Λ3W ∗at Ω
satisﬁes J2 = −1 and deﬁnes an integrable complex structure on U.
10

Proof:
We have seen that ˆˆΩ= −Ωand Xφ = −ˆΩ, so it follows that (DXφ)2 = −1.
This is an almost complex structure.
To prove integrability, it is easiest to use ﬂat coordinates x1, . . . , x20 on U.
The
symplectic form can be written ω = P
α,β ωαβdxα ∧dxβ with ωαβ constant. Let ωαβ
be the inverse matrix. In these coordinates, since Xφ is the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
of φ, the matrix of J = DXφ is
Jα
β =
X
γ
ωαγ
∂2φ
∂xγ∂xβ
(18)
Following [5], we deﬁne the complex functions z1, . . . , z20 by
zα = xα −i
X
β
ωαβ ∂φ
∂xβ
Then
dzα = dxα −i
X
β,γ
ωαβ
∂2φ
∂xβ∂xγ
dxγ = dxα −i
X
l
Jα
γ dxγ
Now
J(dzα) =
X
β
Jα
β (dxβ −i
X
l
Jβ
γ dxγ) =
X
β
Jα
β dxβ + idxα = idzα
so dzα is of type (1, 0). Since dzα+d¯zα = 2dxα spans the cotangent space at each point,
we can ﬁnd 10 independent functions amongst these which are local holomorphic
coordinates for U.
✷
At each Ωwe have the natural complex structure J on the vector space Λ3W ∗but W
itself is also complex with respect to IΩ. Take the type decomposition of Λ3W ∗⊗C
with respect to IΩ:
Λ3W ∗⊗C = Λ3,0 ⊕Λ2,1 ⊕Λ1,2 ⊕Λ0,3.
Proposition 6 The complex structure J = i on Λ3,0 ⊕Λ2,1 and −i on Λ1,2 ⊕Λ0,3.
Proof:
Given a ∈sl(W) let Xa be the vector ﬁeld on Λ3W ∗induced by the action.
This is a linear action. This means that DXa = ρ(a) where ρ is the representation at
the Lie algebra level, and Xa = ρ(a)Ωwhere Ωis the position vector.
11

Now φ is invariant under SL(W) so [Xa, Xφ] = 0, thus
J(Xa) = DXφ(Xa) = DXa(Xφ) = ρ(a)Xφ
(19)
But Xφ = −ˆΩfrom Proposition 4, and Xa = ρ(a)Ω, thus (19) can be written
J(ρ(a)Ω) = −ρ(a)ˆΩ
and since J2 = −1,
J(ρ(a)(Ω+ iˆΩ)) = −ρ(a)(ˆΩ−iΩ) = iρ(a)(Ω+ iˆΩ)
(20)
From (14)
ρ(a)(Ω+ iˆΩ) =
X
i,j
ai
jθj ∧ι(wi)(Ω+ iˆΩ)
and since Ω+ iˆΩis of type (3, 0), this is of type (3, 0) + (2, 1). The complex structure
J acts on it as i from (20).
Consider J acting on the vector ﬁeld Ω. We use (18) to calculate
J(Ω)α =
X
β,γ
ωαγxβ
∂2φ
∂xγ∂xβ
=
X
γ
ωαγ ∂φ
∂xγ
= −ˆΩα
since φ(Ω) is homogeneous of degree 2 and so ∂φ/∂xα has degree 1. It follows that
J(Ω+ iˆΩ) = i(Ω+ iˆΩ) so J acts as i on forms of type (3, 0).
Now SL(W) has orbits of real codimension one, and the position vector ﬁeld Ω
is transverse to the orbit so any vector of type (3, 0) + (2, 1) is a complex linear
combination of a vector ρ(a)(Ω+ iˆΩ) and Ω+ iˆΩand hence is acted on by J as i. ✷
3.4
Special geometry of U
We have actually derived here a certain geometric structure on the open set U – a
special pseudo-K¨ahler metric. Recall from [3] the deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 3 A special K¨ahler manifold is a complex manifold M with complex struc-
ture J ∈Ω1(T) such that
• there is a K¨ahler metric g with K¨ahler form ω
• a ﬂat torsion-free connection D such that
12

• Dω = 0 and
• dDJ = 0 ∈Ω2(M, T)
Proposition 7 The open set U ⊂Λ3W ∗has an SL(W)-invariant special pseudo-
K¨ahler structure of Hermitian signature (1, 9) and Xφ is an inﬁnitesimal isometry of
the metric.
Proof:
Firstly, U is given as an open set in a symplectic vector space, so we take
the ﬂat torsion-free connection as the ordinary derivative D. The complex structure
J is given by J = DXφ = dDXφ, so
dDJ = d2
DXφ = 0
since D is ﬂat.
For a pseudo-K¨ahler metric, the metric and symplectic form are
related by
g(X, Y ) = ω(JX, Y ).
But ω(JΩ1, Ω2) is given in ﬂat coordinates by
X
α
Jα
β ωαγ =
∂2φ
∂xγ∂xβ
from (18). This is symmetric and hence deﬁnes a metric
g =
X
β,γ
∂2φ
∂xβ∂xγ
dxβdxγ.
We need to determine the signature of the corresponding Hermitian form.
From Proposition 6, the (1, 0) vectors for J are Λ3,0 ⊕Λ2,1 and the symplectic form
ω is
ω(Ω1, Ω2)ǫ = Ω1 ∧Ω2.
Now if θ1, θ2, θ3 form a basis for Λ1,0,
θ1 ∧θ2 ∧¯θ3 ∧¯θ1 ∧¯θ2 ∧θ3 = −θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 ∧¯θ1 ∧¯θ2 ∧¯θ3
so the Hermitian form on Λ2,1 has the opposite sign to that on the 1-dimensional
space Λ3,0. But the metric applied to the position vector ﬁeld Ω(which is the real
part of a vector in Λ3,0) is
g(Ω, Ω) =
X
∂2φ
∂xα∂xβ
xαxβ = 2φ
13

since φ is homogeneous of degree 2. Since φ is positive, the metric is positive on Λ3,0
and hence has signature (1, 9).
The vector ﬁeld Xφ integrates, as we have seen, to the circle action Ω+ iˆΩ7→eiθ(Ω+
iˆΩ). This changes the complex 3-form, but not the underlying complex structure IΩ.
From Proposition 6, the complex structure J on U only depends on IΩ, so that the
circle action preserves J. By deﬁnition Xφ is symplectic, so it preserves the metric
too.
✷
Remark: The C∗action generated by the vector ﬁelds Xφ = ˆΩand Ωis holomorphic
and the quotient has (see [3]) a projective special K¨ahler structure. This space in our
case is the space of complex structures on R6 compatible with a given orientation,
the homogeneous space GL+(6, R)/GL(3, C).
The symplectic approach of this section will be especially useful in analyzing the
variational problem, but we take a short detour ﬁrst to investigate a little more the
linear algebra of 3-forms in 6 dimensions.

Self-duality of 3-forms

Lorentzian self-duality
We point out here how the geometry of 3-forms in six dimensions can be interpreted
in the presence of a Lorentzian metric. This will shed some light on the nonlinear
map Ω7→ˆΩand also explain the setting for a nonlinear equation of some current
interest in theoretical physics.
Suppose then that the 6-dimensional real vector space W has a metric of signature
(5, 1). The Hodge star operator
∗: Λ3W ∗→Λ3W ∗
is deﬁned by the basic property
α ∧∗β = (α, β)ǫ
(21)
where ǫ ∈Λ6W ∗is the volume form.
Example:
If e0, e1, . . . , e5 is an orthogonal basis of W ∗with (e0, e0) = −1 and
(ei, ei) = 1 for 1 ≤i ≤5, then with ǫ = e0 ∧e1 ∧. . . ∧e5, we have
∗e0 ∧e1 ∧e2
=
−e3 ∧e4 ∧e5
∗e3 ∧e4 ∧e5
=
−e0 ∧e1 ∧e2
14

The star operator just deﬁned has the property ∗2 = 1 and we can decompose Λ3W ∗
into the ±1 eigenspaces of ∗– the self-dual and anti-self-dual 3-forms:
Λ3W ∗= Λ+ ⊕Λ−
If β = θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 is a non-zero decomposable 3-form, let ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3 be a basis for the
3-dimensional space orthogonal to that spanned by θ1, θ2, θ3. Then from the deﬁnition
of the Hodge star (21), we see that α ∧∗β = 0 for any 3-form α of the form ϕi ∧ρ.
This means that ∗β is a multiple of ϕ1 ∧ϕ2 ∧ϕ3. Thus, as in the example above,
the Hodge star takes decomposable 3-forms to decomposable 3-forms. Geometrically
it transforms a volume form on a 3-dimensional subspace to a volume form on the
orthogonal space.
If β (real or complex) is decomposable and ∗β = β then the space spanned by θ1, θ2, θ3
is orthogonal to itself and hence isotropic.
We see next that real self-dual 3-forms lie on one side of the hypersurface λ(Ω) = 0:
Proposition 8 Let Ω∈Λ3W ∗be self-dual then λ(Ω) ≥0 and if λ(Ω) > 0 then
Ω= α + ∗α where α ∈Λ3W ∗is decomposable.
Proof:
Suppose λ(Ω) < 0, then from Proposition 1, Ω= α + ¯α with α = θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3
and θi complex. These span the (1, 0) forms for the complex structure IΩ. Since ∗
is linear and α, ¯α are unique up to ordering, the self-duality condition implies that
either
∗α = α
or
∗α = ¯α.
In the ﬁrst case, the space of (1, 0) forms is isotropic, so we have a pseudo-hermitian
metric. This must have real signature of the form (2k, 6 −2k) and not (5, 1).
In the second case the θi are orthogonal to the ¯θj so the metric is of type (2, 0)+(0, 2)
and so the signature must be (3, 3) and not (5, 1).
We conclude that λ(Ω) > 0 and from Proposition 1, Ω= α + β for real decomposable
forms α, β. Since ∗Ω= Ωwe must have either ∗α = α and ∗β = β or ∗α = β. The
ﬁrst implies that there is a real isotropic 3-dimensional subspace which is impossible
in signature (5, 1) so the second condition holds, as required.
Note that since α ∧β ̸= 0, the two 3-dimensional subspaces of W determined by α
and β span W. Since they are orthogonal, one must have signature (2, 1) and the
other (3, 0).
✷
Remark:
We see from the proposition that Ω= α + ∗α where α and ∗α are
decomposable. The signature of the two 3-dimensional subspaces gives us a means of
15

distinguishing α and ∗α and hence an ordering. The formula (21) tells us that
α ∧∗α = (α, α)ǫ
so if the metric on the 3-dimensional subspace of W determined by α is of signature
(2, 1) (or equivalently (α, α) > 0) then this is the ordering determined as in Section
2 by the orientation.
Since for a self-dual form λ(Ω) > 0, and Ω= α + ∗α, by the deﬁnition of the map
Ω7→ˆΩwe have
ˆΩ= α −∗α
hence
Proposition 9 If Ωis self-dual ˆΩis anti-self-dual.
Thus Ω7→ˆΩis a nonlinear map from an open set of the space Λ+ to Λ−. We deﬁne
in this case
φ(Ω) =
p
λ(Ω)
to be the positive square root.
4.2
Lagrangian aspects
There is a symplectic interpretation also to self-duality. First recall that the symplec-
tic form ω on Λ3W ∗is deﬁned by ω(Ω1, Ω2)ǫ = Ω1 ∧Ω2. We have
Proposition 10 The subspaces Λ+, Λ−⊂Λ3W ∗of self-dual and anti-self-dual 3-
forms are Lagrangian.
Proof:
Suppose Ω1, Ω2 are self-dual then
Ω1 ∧Ω2 = Ω1 ∧∗Ω2 = (Ω1, Ω2)ǫ
and similarly Ω2 ∧Ω1 = (Ω2, Ω1)ǫ. But (Ω1, Ω2) = (Ω2, Ω1) and Ω1 ∧Ω2 = −Ω1 ∧Ω2
so Ω1 ∧Ω2 = 0. The same argument gives the anti-self-dual version.
✷
From this result, the symplectic pairing identiﬁes Λ−with the dual space Λ∗
+. We
then obtain:
16

Proposition 11 The map Ω7→ˆΩfrom Λ+ to Λ−∼= Λ∗
+ is the derivative of −φ
restricted to Λ+.
Proof:
We saw in Proposition 4 that −ˆΩ= Xφ the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld gener-
ated by the function φ. Let ˙Ωbe tangent to Λ+, then
dφ( ˙Ω) = ω(Xφ, ˙Ω)
But this pairing identiﬁes Λ−, in which Xφ = −ˆΩlies, with Λ∗
+, hence the result. ✷
From (10) and (11) we see that the subset
L = {Ω+ ˆΩ∈Λ+ ⊕Λ−: λ(Ω) > 0}
is the Lagrangian submanifold generated by the invariant function −φ. If f(x) is an
arbitrary smooth function, then the form
Ω+ f(φ)ˆΩ
where Ωis self-dual, lies on the Lagrangian submanifold generated by g(φ) where
g′(x) = f(x). This is the setting for a nonlinear equation – the equation of motion
for a self-interacting self-dual tensor in six dimensions – which appears in the physics
literature [6] in the context of M-theory ﬁve-branes. Explicitly these equations are:
dH = d(H+ + H−) = 0
where H+, H−are the self-dual and anti-self-dual components of the 3-form H, and
(H+)abc
=
Q−1habc
(H−)abc
=
Q−1kd
ahdbc
where
kb
a = hacdhbcd
and
Q = 1 −2
3 tr k2.
The equations say in our language that H−is proportional to ˆH+. They can be put
in the form
d(Ω+ f(φ)ˆΩ) = 0
for a particular function f(φ).
If we replace the nonlinear Lagrangian submanifold which deﬁnes this equation by the
linear one Λ+ then we just obtain the self-dual “Maxwell equations” in six dimensions.
17

4.3
Spinor formulation
For self-dual forms, the function φ and the nonlinear map Ω7→ˆΩalso have a concrete
representation using 2-component spinors. We recall the special isomorphism
Spin(5, 1) ∼= SL(2, H).
The two spin representations in this signature are dual 4-dimensional complex vector
spaces S and S∗with a quaternionic structure, and then
Λ+ ∼= Sym2S∗,
Λ−∼= Sym2S
are the real 10-dimensional spaces of self-dual and anti-self-dual 3-forms. Thus a
self-dual 3-form can be interpreted as a symmetric linear map
A : S →S∗.
The quartic invariant function λ must be a multiple of the only SL(4, C) quartic
invariant of A, namely the determinant:
λ(A) = 4 det A.
We ﬁnd now the following simple expression for ˆΩ:
Proposition 12
• If A ∈Sym2S∗represents a self-dual 3-form Ωthen
ˆΩ=
√
det AA−1 ∈Sym2S.
• If B ∈Sym2S represents an anti-self-dual 3-form Ωthen
ˆΩ= −
√
det AA−1 ∈Sym2S.
Proof:
We use Proposition 11. We have the standard identity for diﬀerentiating
the determinant:
1
det Ad(det A)( ˙A) = d(log det A)( ˙A) = tr(A−1 ˙A)
and so since φ =
√
λ = 2
√
det A,
dφ( ˙A) = d(2
√
det A)( ˙A) = tr(
√
det AA−1 ˙A)
and taking tr(AB) to be the natural pairing between Sym2S and Sym2S∗we have
the result for self-dual forms. The second result follows from ˆˆΩ= −Ω.
✷
18

The isomorphism Spin(5, 1) ∼= SL(2, H) is fundamental in the twistor theory of the
4-sphere. The group SO(5, 1) acts as the conformal transformations of S4 deﬁned
by the quadric x2
0 = x2
1 + . . . + x2
5 in RP5 = P(W) and SL(2, H) as the projective
transformations of the twistor space CP3 = P(S) which commute with the real
structure. The 4-sphere parametrizes this way the real lines in CP3. Now a self-dual
3-form with λ(Ω) > 0 can be written Ω= α + ∗α where α deﬁnes a 3-dimensional
subspace of W with signature (2, 1). The corresponding plane in RP5 intersects S4
in a circle. On the other hand the quadratic form A representing Ωdeﬁnes a quadric
in CP3. This geometry comes to the fore in particular in the study of the moduli
space of charge 2 instantons [4].
Note that in the twistor interpretation, a quadratic form A with det(A) ̸= 0 deﬁnes
a nonsingular quadric in CP3. From (12) the map Ω7→ˆΩis then nothing more than
replacing a quadric by the dual quadric.
5
An invariant functional
5.1
Critical points
We return now to the mainstream of our development. Let M be a closed, oriented
6-manifold. A global 3-form Ωon M deﬁnes at each point a vector in Λ3T ∗and so a
global section λ(Ω) of (Λ6T ∗)2. We take |λ(Ω)|, which is a non-negative continuous
section of (Λ6T ∗)2, and the square root (a section of Λ6T ∗) which lies in the given
orientation class.
Thus
p
|λ(Ω)| is a continuous 6-form on M, which is smooth
wherever λ(Ω) is non-zero. We deﬁne a functional Φ on C∞(Λ3T ∗) by
Φ(Ω) =
Z
M
p
|λ(Ω)|
(22)
Since λ : Λ3T ∗→(Λ6T ∗)2 is GL(6, R)-invariant, Φ is clearly invariant under the
action of orientation-preserving diﬀeomorphisms.
The functional Φ is homogeneous of degree 2 in Ω, just like the norm square of a
form using a Riemannian metric and it is natural to try and apply “non-linear Hodge
theory” – to look for critical points of Φ on a cohomology class of closed 3-forms on
M. We ﬁnd the following:
Theorem 13 Let M be a compact complex 3-manifold with trivial canonical bundle
and Ωthe real part of a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form. Then Ωis a critical point
of the functional Φ restricted to the cohomology class [Ω] ∈H3(M, R).
19

Conversely, if Ωis a critical point on a cohomology class of an oriented closed 6-
manifold M and λ(Ω) < 0 everywhere, then Ωdeﬁnes on M the structure of a complex
manifold such that Ωis the real part of a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form.
Proof:
Choose a non-vanishing 6-form ǫ on M and assume that Ωis a closed 3-form
with λ(Ω) < 0 (as is the case for the real part of a holomorphic 3-form). Writing
λ(Ω) = −φ(Ω)2ǫ2
we have
Φ(Ω) =
Z
M
φ(Ω)ǫ.
Since λ(Ω) ̸= 0, φ is smooth so take the ﬁrst variation of this functional:
δΦ( ˙Ω) =
Z
M
dφ( ˙Ω)ǫ
(23)
From the symplectic interpretation, dφ( ˙Ω) = ω(Xφ, ˙Ω) and Xφ = −ˆΩ, so that
dφ( ˙Ω)ǫ = −ˆΩ∧˙Ω
and therefore (23) gives
δΦ( ˙Ω) = −
Z
M
ˆΩ∧˙Ω
(24)
We are varying in a ﬁxed cohomology class, so ˙Ω= dϕ for some 2-form ϕ. Putting
this in the integral, we have
δΦ( ˙Ω) = −
Z
M
ˆΩ∧dϕ =
Z
M
dˆΩ∧ϕ
by Stokes’ theorem. Thus δΦ = 0 at Ωfor all ϕ if and only if
dˆΩ= 0.
If M is a complex manifold with a non-vanishing holomorphic 3-form Ω+ iˆΩthen
since a holomorphic 3-form is closed, dΩ= dˆΩ= 0 and so Ωis a critical point for Φ.
Conversely, assume that d(Ω+ iˆΩ) = 0 and λ(Ω) < 0. Then a complex 1-form θ is of
type (1, 0) with respect to the almost complex structure IΩif and only if
θ ∧(Ω+ iˆΩ) = 0.
20

Taking the exterior derivative
dθ ∧(Ω+ iˆΩ) = 0
which means that dθ has no (0, 2) component. But from the Newlander-Nirenberg
theorem this means that IΩis integrable. Since (Ω+ iˆΩ) is of type (3, 0),
0 = d(Ω+ iˆΩ) = ¯∂(Ω+ iˆΩ)
and so is holomorphic.
✷
Example: A Calabi-Yau threefold is by deﬁnition a K¨ahler manifold with a covariant
constant (and hence nonvanishing) holomorphic 3-form, and so its complex structure
appears as a critical point of the functional. These are perhaps the most interesting
and plentiful examples. On the other hand, at the opposite extreme from the K¨ahler
case are the non-K¨ahler complex threefolds with trivial canonical bundle which are
diﬀeomorphic to connected sums of k ≥2 copies of S3 × S3 (see [9]).
5.2
Nondegeneracy
Since the functional Φ is diﬀeomorphism invariant, any critical point lies on a Diﬀ(M)-
orbit of critical points and so cannot be non-degenerate. We can ask however if it
is formally a Morse-Bott critical point i.e. if its Hessian is nondegenerate transverse
to the action of Diﬀ(M). The next proposition gives conditions under which this is
true:
Proposition 14 Let M be a compact complex 3-manifold with non-vanishing holo-
morphic 3-form Ω+ iˆΩ. Suppose M satisﬁes the ∂¯∂-lemma, then the Hessian of Φ is
nondegenerate transverse to the action of Diﬀ(M) at Ω.
(Recall that the ∂¯∂-lemma holds if each exact p-form α satisfying ∂α = 0 and ¯∂α = 0
can be written as α = ∂¯∂β for some (p −2)-form β. This is true for any K¨ahler
manifold, but also for the non-K¨ahler examples above.)
Proof:
We need the second variation of the functional
Φ(Ω) =
Z
M
φ(Ω)ǫ.
Since φ depends only on the value of Ωat a point and not its derivatives we obtain
the Hessian
δ2Φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2) =
Z
M
D2φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2)ǫ
21

but from the Hamiltonian interpretation we can write this as
δ2Φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2) =
Z
M
DXφ( ˙Ω1) ∧˙Ω2 =
Z
M
J ˙Ω1 ∧˙Ω2
(25)
We want to study the degeneracy of the Hessian, so suppose that δ2Φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2) = 0 for
˙Ω1 = dψ and all ˙Ω2 = dϕ. Then from (25)
0 =
Z
M
Jdψ ∧dϕ = −
Z
M
dJdψ ∧ϕ
by Stokes’ theorem. This holds for all 2-forms ϕ, which implies
dJdψ = 0.
Thus to prove the theorem we should deduce from this that dψ is tangent to the
Diﬀ(M) orbit through Ω.
The tangent space to the Diﬀ(M) orbit is the space spanned by LXΩfor a vector
ﬁeld X. We have
LXΩ= d(ι(X)Ω) + ι(X)dΩ
but since Ωis closed, these are the 3-forms d(ι(X)Ω). Since Ωis the real part of
a non-vanishing (3, 0) form, the 2-forms ι(X)Ωare precisely the real sections α of
Λ2,0 ⊕Λ0,2.
The theorem follows from the following lemma:
Lemma 15 Let M be a compact complex 3-manifold with non-vanishing holomorphic
3-form which satisﬁes the ∂¯∂-lemma, then dψ is tangent to the Diﬀ(M) orbit of Ωif
and only if dJdψ = 0.
Proof:
If ψ is of type (2, 0) then dψ ∈C∞(Λ3,0 ⊕Λ2,1) and then from Proposition
6, dJdψ = d(idψ) = id2ψ = 0. Thus dJdψ = 0.
Conversely, suppose dJdψ = 0. Since we have just seen this holds for all ψ of type
(2, 0)+(0, 2) assume ψ has type (1, 1). Then dψ = ∂ψ + ¯∂ψ where ∂ψ, ¯∂ψ are of type
(2, 1), (1, 2) respectively. From Proposition 6,
0 = dJdψ = id∂ψ −id¯∂ψ = 2i∂¯∂ψ.
This means that ∂dψ = ¯∂dψ = 0 and so applying the ∂¯∂-lemma to dψ we can write
dψ = i∂¯∂γ
22

for a real 1-form γ. Writing γ = θ + ¯θ where θ is of type (1, 0), we have
dψ = i∂¯∂γ = i∂¯∂(θ + ¯θ) = d(i(¯∂¯θ −∂θ))
Since i(¯∂¯θ −∂θ) is real and of type (2, 0) + (0, 2) this proves the lemma.
✷
At a formal level what we have proved here is that if we consider the invariant
functional Φ as a function on the quotient of a cohomology class by Diﬀ(M), then it
has a non-degenerate critical point at a 3-form Ωwhich deﬁnes a complex manifold
with trivial canonical bundle. We then expect that nearby cohomology classes will also
have non-degenerate critical points and that an open set in H3(M, R) will parametrize
the moduli of such complex structures, (together with holomorphic 3-forms). This is
true in all dimensions by the results of A. Todorov [15] and G. Tian [14], but we shall
give next a direct treatment in three dimensions from our variational point of view.
6
The moduli space
6.1
Sobolev spaces
If f(x, t) is a smooth family of functions f : Rm × Rn 7→R such that f(x, 0) has a
non-degenerate critical point at x = 0, then there is a neighbourhood U × V of (0, 0)
such for each t ∈V , f(x, t) has a unique non-degenerate critical point in U. To prove
this, we just apply the implicit function theorem to the map
(x, t) 7→Dxf.
We shall use this argument next in a Banach space context to translate the formal
results of the last section into a concrete construction of a moduli space.
Take a 3-form Ωon M deﬁning a complex structure satisfying the ∂¯∂-lemma, and
choose a Hermitian metric. We take a slice for the Diﬀ(M) action at Ωby looking
at the space of closed forms which are orthogonal to the orbit of Ω. Recall that the
tangent space of the orbit consists of forms dψ where ψ is real and of type (2, 0)+(0, 2),
so using
Z
M
(α, dψ) =
Z
M
(d∗α, ψ)
23

orthogonality is the condition
(d∗α)2,0 = 0.
We shall work with Sobolev spaces of forms L2
k(Λp), choosing k appropriately when
required. So let E be the Banach space
E = {α ∈L2
k(Λ3) : dα = 0
and
(d∗α)2,0 = 0}.
First we show that L2 orthogonal projection onto E is well-behaved in the Sobolev
norm.
Let G be the Green’s operator for the Laplacian ∆on forms. Then elliptic regularity
says that
G : L2
k(Λp) →L2
k+2(Λp)
and for any form α we have a Hodge decomposition
α = H(α) + d(d∗Gα) + d∗(Gdα)
(26)
where H(α) is harmonic. So given α ∈L2
k(Λ3) deﬁne ﬁrst the form α1 ∈L2
k(Λ3) by
α1 = H(α) + d(d∗Gα).
This is an L2 orthogonal projection to closed forms in the same Sobolev space. To
further project onto E we want to ﬁnd a form θ of type (2, 0) such that
α2 = α1 + d(θ + ¯θ)
satisﬁes (d∗α2)2,0 = 0. Write
d∗Gα = ρ + ν + ¯ν ∈L2
k+1(Λ2)
where ρ is of type (1, 1) and ν of type (2, 0). Then with ψ = θ + ν we want
(d∗d(ρ + ψ + ¯ψ))2,0 = 0
or, decomposing into types,
¯∂∗∂ρ + ∂∗∂ψ + ¯∂∗¯∂ψ = 0
or equivalently
(∂∗∂+ ¯∂∗¯∂)ψ = −¯∂∗∂ρ
(27)
Now ∂∗∂+ ¯∂∗¯∂is elliptic. Indeed it is the sum of two non-negative second order
operators ∂∗∂and ¯∂∗¯∂and the latter is itself elliptic on (2, 0) forms. The null space
24

consists of (2, 0) forms ψ satisfying ¯∂ψ = ∂ψ = 0 (the holomorphic 2-forms). It
follows that for each ψ in this null-space
Z
M
(¯∂∗∂ρ, ψ) =
Z
M
(ρ, ¯∂ψ) = 0
and so given ρ, we can solve the equation (27) for ψ. Using the Green’s operator for
∂∗∂+ ¯∂∗¯∂, we ﬁnd θ ∈L2
k+1(Λ2) as required.
Thus α2 = α1 + d(θ + ¯θ) ∈L2
k(Λ3) lies in the Banach space E, and the map α 7→α2
is a continuous projection, orthogonal in L2.
If α is harmonic, then dα = 0 and d∗α = 0 and so in particular (d∗α)2,0 = 0 and
α ∈E.
We then split E = E1 ⊕E2 where E1 is the ﬁnite-dimensional space of
harmonic forms and E2 the exact ones in E.
The Banach space E is L2-orthogonal to the orbit of Diﬀ(M) through Ωand hence is
transversal to the orbits through a neighbourhood of Ω. The functional Φ is smooth
for 3-forms α for which λ(α) < 0 at all points, so in order to deﬁne Φ on E we need
uniform estimates on α. The Sobolev embedding theorem tells us that in 6 dimensions
we can achieve this with L2
k(Λ3) for k > 3. Moreover in this range L2
k is a Banach
algebra and so multiplication is smooth. Thus in a Sobolev neighbourhood of Ω, Φ
is a smooth function on E. Its derivative at α is given (from (24)) by
δΦ( ˙α) = −
Z
M
ˆα ∧˙α =
Z
M
(∗ˆα, ˙α)ǫ =
Z
M
(P(∗ˆα), ˙α)ǫ
where P is orthogonal projection onto E.
The space E is transverse to the Diﬀ(M) orbits, and Φ is constant on these, so its
derivative is determined by its derivative as a function on E. We want the critical
points of Φ restricted to a cohomology class so if P2 denotes orthogonal projection
onto the exact forms E2, our critical points are the zeros of the function F : E →E2
deﬁned by
F(α) = P2(∗ˆα).
6.2
Invertibility of the derivative
To apply the implicit function theorem, we want the derivative D2F : E2 →E2 to be
invertible, where, as we calculated in the previous section,
D2F( ˙α) = P2(∗J ˙α).
25

The second variation calculation (25) shows that this is an injection for exact ˙α.
We now prove surjectivity. Note that if β is of type (2, 0) + (0, 2), P2(∗Jdβ) = 0, so
surjectivity for dβ ∈L2
k(Λ3) implies surjectivity on the transversal E2. We use the
following lemma (the proof is somewhat shorter in the K¨ahler case):
Lemma 16 If γ ∈L2
k+1(Λ1,1) is a real form which satisﬁes (d∗dγ)2,0 = 0, then there
exist a real form ρ ∈L2
k(Λ3) with d∗ρ = 0 and a complex form σ ∈L2
k+1(Λ2,2) such
that
dγ = ρ + ∂∗σ + ¯∂∗¯σ.
Proof:
The condition (d∗dγ)2,0 = 0 is equivalent to
¯∂∗∂γ = 0
(28)
Using the Green’s operator for the ¯∂-Laplacian, we write
∂γ = H + ¯∂G¯∂∗∂γ + ¯∂∗G¯∂∂γ = H + ¯∂∗G¯∂∂γ
(29)
from (28). Here H is the ¯∂-harmonic component.
Now if ¯∂θ = 0, applying the ∂¯∂-lemma to dθ we have dθ = ∂¯∂ν and so θ −¯∂ν is
closed. Moreover, by imposing the condition ¯∂∗ν = 0, if θ ∈L2
k, ν ∈L2
k+1. Similarly if
¯∂∗θ = 0, there is a form ν such that ψ = θ−¯∂∗ν is coclosed: d∗ψ = 0. Applying this to
the harmonic part H, which satisﬁes ¯∂∗H = 0, we have a coclosed form ψ = H −¯∂∗ν
and so from (29) a (2, 2) form σ = G¯∂∂γ −ν such that
∂γ = ψ + ¯∂∗σ.
Adding on the complex conjugate we obtain
dγ = ρ + ¯∂∗σ + ∂∗¯σ
as required.
✷
To continue with surjectivity, take dγ ∈E2. Since P2(dγ) = 0 if γ is of type (2, 0) +
(0, 2), we may assume that γ is of type (1, 1). From the lemma, we can write
dγ
=
ρ + ¯∂∗σ + ∂∗¯σ
=
ρ + (¯∂∗+ ∂∗)u + i(¯∂∗−∂∗)v
26

where σ = u + iv. Now v is of type (2, 2) so i(¯∂∗−∂∗)v = J(¯∂∗+ ∂∗)v = Jd∗v which
gives
Jd∗v = dγ −ρ −d∗u.
Since ρ is coclosed, d∗(ρ + d∗u) = 0 and thus the form ρ + d∗u is orthogonal to all
exact forms. Hence P2(Jd∗v) = P2(dγ) or
P2(∗Jd ∗v) = P2(dγ)
and we have surjectivity.
From the open mapping theorem the derivative is now
invertible.
6.3
The geometry of the moduli space
We can now apply the implicit function theorem for Banach spaces to deduce that in
a suﬃciently small neighbourhood U′ of Ω, the subspace f −1(0) ∩U′ is diﬀeomorphic
to a neighbourhood of H(Ω) ∈E1, the space of harmonic 3-forms. Equivalently, the
natural projection p : E →H3(M, R) identiﬁes f −1(0) ∩U′ with a neighbourhood U
of the cohomology class [Ω].
Taking k > 4 for the Sobolev space L2
k(Λ3), we have enough regularity to use the proof
of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem in [11] to deduce that the critical points of Φ on
U′ ⊂E deﬁne a family of complex structures with trivial canonical bundle on M. We
now have what we need: a family of critical points parametrized by U ⊂H3(M, R).
In this real approach to Calabi-Yau manifolds, the ﬁrst thing we reach is a moduli
space which is an open set in the real vector space H3(M, R). We expect to see a
complex structure on this (though the reader might also appreciate Kodaira’s recol-
lection in [8] “At ﬁrst we did not take notice of the fact that the parameter appearing
in the deﬁnition of a complex manifold is in general a complex one...”). We shall see
next how a complex structure arises in our formalism.
Proposition 17 The open set U ⊂H3(M, R) has the structure of a special pseudo-
K¨ahler manifold of Hermitian signature (1, h2,1 −1).
Proof:
The construction is essentially induced from that on Λ3W ∗of Section 3. In
fact if M is a 6-torus the two are exactly the same.
We made use of the symplectic form
ω(Ω1, Ω2)ǫ = Ω1 ∧Ω2
27

on Λ3W ∗and here we use its integrated form to deﬁne a ﬂat symplectic structure on
H3(M, R): take closed forms Ω1, Ω2 with cohomology classes [Ω1], [Ω2] and deﬁne
ω([Ω1], [Ω2]) =
Z
M
Ω1 ∧Ω2 = ([Ω1] ∪[Ω2])[M].
By Poincar´e duality this is non-degenerate.
If Ωdeﬁnes a complex structure then so does cos θ Ω+ sin θ ˆΩso we may as well
assume that the neighbourhood U is invariant by the circle action
[Ω] 7→cos θ [Ω] + sin θ [ˆΩ].
This vector ﬁeld preserves the symplectic form and has Hamiltonian function
Ψ = ([Ω] ∪[ˆΩ])[M].
From (16) this is essentially the critical value of the functional Φ at the critical point
Ω.
The derivative of the map [Ω] 7→[ˆΩ] on U deﬁnes an almost complex structure since
ˆˆΩ= −Ω, and it is integrable just as in Proposition 5.
All that remains is to determine the signature. Here we use the fact that the ∂¯∂-
lemma implies that the cohomology has a (p, q) decomposition. This is the argument
we used in proving surjectivity: each ¯∂-closed form can be made closed by adding on
a ¯∂-exact form. The determination of the sign is then just as in Proposition 7.
✷
This special pseudo-K¨ahler structure (see [2] for its origins) again has the property
that the circle action is an isometry giving the quotient by the C∗action the structure
of a projective special K¨ahler manifold. This quotient forgets the choice of holomor-
phic 3-form and is a complex manifold of dimension h2,1 which by our construction
parametrizes a family of complex structures on M. Since from Proposition 6, J acts
as i on H2,1, this is, as a complex manifold, the usual Kuranishi moduli space.

Manifolds with holonomy G2
7.1
Linear algebra
We have seen above how the consideration of a diﬀeomorphism-invariant functional
on the space of 3-forms on a 6-manifold leads in a natural way to complex threefolds
28

with trivial canonical bundle and the special structure of their moduli space. We
conclude now by addressing the analogous question in 7 dimensions.
Let W be a 7-dimensional real vector space, and Λ3W ∗the 35-dimensional vector
space of alternating multilinear 3-forms on W. Take Ω∈Λ3W ∗and v, w ∈W and
the interior products ι(v)Ω, ι(w)Ω∈Λ2W ∗. Then deﬁne BΩ: W ⊗W →Λ7W ∗by
BΩ(v, w) = −1
6ι(v)Ω∧ι(w)Ω∧Ω.
Since 2-forms commute this is symmetric in v, w. It is a symmetric bilinear form
on W with values in the one-dimensional space Λ7W ∗, so it deﬁnes a linear map
KΩ: W →W ∗⊗Λ7W ∗and we then have
det KΩ∈(Λ7W ∗)9.
Since the exponent 9 is odd, if det KΩ̸= 0 then it deﬁnes this way an orientation on
W and, relative to this orientation we choose the positive root
(det KΩ)1/9 ∈Λ7W ∗.
We then have an inner product naturally deﬁned by Ω:
gΩ(v, w) = BΩ(v, w)(det KΩ)−1/9
and det K1/9
Ω
is its volume form.
Let w1, . . . , w7 be a basis of W and θ1, . . . , θ7 the dual basis of W ∗. For the 3-form
ϕ = (θ1∧θ2 −θ3 ∧θ4)∧θ5 +(θ1∧θ3 −θ4 ∧θ2)∧θ6 +(θ1∧θ4 −θ2 ∧θ3)∧θ7+θ4θ6θ7 (30)
an easy calculation gives the standard Euclidean metric
gϕ =
7
X
1
θ2
i
(31)
The stabilizer of ϕ in GL(7, R) therefore preserves a metric and so is compact. It is
(see [13]) the 14-dimensional Lie group G2: the metric and 3-form deﬁne the structure
constants of the multiplication of the imaginary octonions. Since
dim GL(7, R) −dim G2 = 49 −14 = 35 = dim Λ3W ∗
the form ϕ has an open orbit U ⊂Λ3W ∗. We call a form in this orbit positive.
29

Deﬁnition 4 Fix a basis vector ǫ ∈Λ7W ∗, and for a positive form Ωdeﬁne φ(Ω) ∈R
by
φ(Ω)ǫ = det K1/9
Ω
Note that since KΩis homogeneous of degree 3 in Ω, φ(Ω) is homogeneous of degree
3 × 7/9 = 7/3.
There is a formula for the invariant φ analogous to (16). Let ∗: Λ3W ∗→Λ4W ∗be
the Hodge star operator of the metric gΩ, then
Ω∧∗Ω= 6φ
(32)
This follows from consideration of the standard 3-form ϕ. As in [13], we have
∗ϕ
=
θ1 ∧θ2 ∧θ3 ∧θ4 −(θ1 ∧θ2 −θ3 ∧θ4) ∧θ6 ∧θ7 −(θ1 ∧θ3 −θ4 ∧θ2) ∧θ7 ∧θ5
−
(θ1 ∧θ4 −θ2 ∧θ3) ∧θ5 ∧θ6
We want to ﬁnd the derivative of φ : U →Λ3W ∗. The exterior product deﬁnes a
non-degenerate pairing
Λ3W ∗⊗Λ4W ∗→Λ7W ∗
and having ﬁxed ǫ ∈Λ7W ∗this deﬁnes an isomorphism
(Λ3W ∗)∗∼= Λ4W ∗.
Thus dφ takes values in Λ4W ∗. We have
Proposition 18 The derivative of φ is given by:
dφ( ˙Ω)ǫ = 7
18 ∗Ω∧˙Ω
where ∗: Λ3W ∗→Λ4W ∗is the Hodge star operator of the metric gΩ.
Proof: The group G2 which stabilizes Ωhas only one invariant in its action on Λ3W ∗,
namely the orthogonal projection onto Ω(see [13]). Thus, since ∗identiﬁes Λ3W ∗
and Λ4W ∗in an invariant way we can only have
dφ( ˙Ω) = C ∗Ω∧˙Ω
for some real number C, possibly dependent on Ω.
But taking ˙Ω= Ω, we have
C(∗Ω∧Ω) = dφ(Ω) = 7
3φ(Ω)
since φ is homogeneous of degree 7/3. From (32), C = 7/18.
✷

7.2
The functional and its critical points
We now deﬁne a functional in 7 dimensions analogous to the one we have analyzed
in 6 dimensions. Recall that if Ωis a 3-form on a closed 7-manifold M, then det K1/9
Ω
is a section of Λ7T ∗. When it is non-vanishing it is the volume form of a metric
canonically determined by Ω. We deﬁne a functional Ψ on C∞(Λ3T ∗) by
Φ(Ω) =
Z
M
det K1/9
Ω.
We then have
Theorem 19 Let M be a closed 7-manifold with a metric with holonomy G2, with
deﬁning 3-form Ω. Then Ωis a critical point of the functional Φ restricted to the
cohomology class [Ω] ∈H3(M, R).
Conversely, if Ωis a critical point on a cohomology class of a closed oriented 7-
manifold M such that Ωis everywhere positive, then Ωdeﬁnes on M a metric with
holonomy G2.
Proof:
Choose a non-vanishing 7-form ǫ on M and assume that Ωis a positive
closed 3-form. Writing
det K1/9
Ω
= φ(Ω)ǫ
we have
Φ(Ω) =
Z
M
φ(Ω)ǫ.
The ﬁrst variation is:
δΦ( ˙Ω) =
Z
M
dφ( ˙Ω)ǫ = 7
18
Z
M
∗Ω∧˙Ω
by (18). Varying in a ﬁxed cohomology class, ˙Ω= dϕ for some 2-form ϕ so δΨ = 0
if and only if
Z
M
d(∗Ω) ∧ϕ = 0
for all ϕ, or
d(∗Ω) = 0.
If Ωis covariant constant, so is ∗Ωand hence is closed. Thus a G2-manifold gives a
critical point of Ψ.
Conversely if dΩ= d(∗Ω) = 0 then Ωis covariant constant for the metric gΩas shown
by M. Fern´andez and A. Gray (see [13]).
✷
31

Example: In D. Joyce’s foundational papers [7] there are many examples of compact
G2-manifolds. We can also take a 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold N with Ωthe
real part of a holomorphic 3-form and ω the K¨ahler form and consider the product
manifold M = S1 × N. The 3-form Ω+ ω ∧dθ deﬁnes a G2-metric.
The second variation of Φ is the quadratic form
Z
M
D2φ( ˙Ω1, ˙Ω2)ǫ
Now 18dφ/7 is the 4-form Θ = ∗Ωso for D2φ what we need is the derivative of
Θ(Ω). This is provided by the lemma below (which is stated in [7]). To set it up,
let us consider the decomposition of Λ3W ∗into G2-representations. Since GL(7, R)
acts transitively on an open set of Λ3W ∗, we are looking at the decomposition of the
quotient gl(7, R)/g2 under the action of the stabilizer G2. Since G2 ⊂SO(7), and
G2 acts transitively on S6, the 21-dimensional skew symmetric part of gl(7, R) maps
to the 21 −14 = 7-dimensional representation in the quotient. The 28-dimensional
symmetric part decomposes into multiples of the identity and the trace-free symmetric
tensors, which are 27-dimensional. Denote as in [7] π1, π7, π27 the projections onto
these invariant subspaces, then we have:
Lemma 20 The derivative of the map Θ(Ω) = ∗Ωat Ωis
DΘ( ˙Ω) = 4
3∗π1( ˙Ω) + ∗π7( ˙Ω) −∗π27( ˙Ω).
Proof:
As in Proposition 6 we consider ﬁrst the derivative applied to tangent
vectors Xa generated by SL(7, R), which span a subspace of codimension 1. Since φ
is invariant we have
X
i
Xi
a
∂φ
∂xi
= 0
and so
X
i,j
∂Xi
a
∂xj
∂φ
∂xi
+ Xi
a
∂2φ
∂xi∂xj
= 0.
From (18) and the fact that DXa = ρ(a) this can be written
DΘ(Xa) = −ρ(a)Θ
or
DΘ(ρ(a)Ω) = −ρ(a)(∗Ω).
32

From (14), if we use an orthonormal basis e1, . . . , e7,
ρ(a)(∗Ω) =
X
i,j
aijej ∧ι(ei) ∗Ω
Now use the relations ι(ei)α = ∗(ei ∧∗α) and ∗2 = (−1)p(n−p) on p-forms and we see
that
X
i,j
aijej ∧ι(ei) ∗Ω= ∗
X
i,j
aijι(ej)(ei ∧Ω) = (tr a) ∗Ω−∗
X
i,j
aijei ∧ι(ej)Ω.
Thus if aij is skew-symmetric, ρ(a)(∗Ω) = −∗(ρ(a)Ω) and so
DΘ(ρ(a)Ω) = −ρ(a)(∗Ω)
(33)
If aij ∈sl(7, R) it has trace zero, so if it is also symmetric ρ(a)(∗Ω) = ∗(ρ(a)Ω) and
DΘ(ρ(a)Ω) = ρ(a)(∗Ω)
(34)
There remains the unique direction orthogonal to the SL(7, R) orbit and this is
spanned by the Euler vector ﬁeld Ω. But
DΘ(Ω)β = 18
7
X
xα
∂2φ
∂xα∂xβ
= 4
3Θβ = 4
3 ∗Ωβ
(35)
since ∂φ/∂xi is homogeneous of degree 4/3. From (33),(34),(35) the lemma follows.
✷
7.3
Nondegeneracy
We now prove, just as in the 6-dimensional case, that at a G2 manifold, the functional
Φ has formally a Morse-Bott critical point. The argument is from one point of view
like the proof of the ∂¯∂-lemma for K¨ahler manifolds, but is also in essence the proof
of Proposition 3.3.2 in Joyce’s paper [7].
Proposition 21 Let M be a compact 7-manifold with a closed 3-form Ωwhich deﬁnes
a G2-structure. Then the Hessian of the functional Φ at Ωis nondegenerate transverse
to the action of Diﬀ(M) at Ω.
Proof:
The tangent space of the orbit of Diﬀ(M) in the closed 3-forms consists of
the forms LXΩ= d(ι(X)Ω) where X is a vector ﬁeld. The map X 7→ι(X)Ωembeds
33

the tangent bundle in Λ2T ∗as a subbundle µ (in the notation of [13]) and we have a
G2-invariant decomposition
Λ2T ∗∼= µ ⊕g
where g is the 14-dimensional adjoint bundle of the G2 structure. Thus the tangent
space of the orbit consists of 3-forms dχ where χ is a section of µ. Deﬁning J :
Λ3T ∗→Λ4T ∗by
J(α) = 4
3∗π1(α) + ∗π7(α) −∗π27(α)
(36)
from (20) we need to show that if dJdψ = 0 then dψ = dχ for χ ∈C∞(µ). By
the diﬀeomorphism invariance of the functional any ψ ∈C∞(µ) already satisﬁes
dJ(dψ) = 0, so we need only restrict ourselves to ψ ∈C∞(g). We use the natural
metric deﬁned by the G2 structure, so that nondegeneracy in directions orthogonal
to the Diﬀ(M)-orbits is the Morse-Bott condition. This means we must prove that if
dJ(dψ) = 0 and πµd∗dψ = 0 then dψ = 0, where πµ is the orthogonal projection onto
the subbundle µ ⊂Λ2T ∗.
Assume we are given ψ ∈C∞(g) and πµd∗dψ = 0. Using the Green’s operator for the
Hodge Laplacian we write
ψ = H(ψ) + dGd∗ψ + d∗Gdψ
so that
dψ = dd∗Gdψ = dGd∗ψ
By assumption πµd∗dψ = 0, so d∗dµ ∈C∞(g). The Hodge Laplacian, and conse-
quently also its Green’s operator, commutes with orthogonal projections given by
reduction of holonomy (see [1] 1.141 for example). So Gd∗dψ ∈C∞(g) and dψ = dχ
where
χ = Gd∗dψ ∈C∞(g)
(37)
and in particular d∗χ = 0.
Now (as in [7]), since χ ∈C∞(g) and G2 acts as the irreducible 7-dimensional repre-
sentation on Λ6T ∗, we have χ ∧∗Ω= 0. Thus dχ ∧∗Ω= 0 ∈C∞(Λ7T ∗) since ∗Ωis
closed, and this means that
π1dχ = 0
(38)
Another algebraic property of χ ∈C∞(g) (again see [7]) is
∗χ = −χ ∧Ω
so d∗χ = 0 implies dχ ∧Ω= 0 ∈C∞(Λ6T ∗) since Ωis closed. This means that
π7dχ = 0.
(39)
34

Now suppose dJdψ = dJdχ = 0. Since π1dχ = π7dχ = 0 we see from (36) that
J(dχ) = 4 ∗dχ/3 and so
dJdχ = −d ∗dχ = 0.
But by Stokes’ theorem d ∗dχ = 0 implies dχ = dψ = 0, so we have nondegeneracy
of the critical point.
✷
7.4
The moduli space
Given this nondegeneracy, we can proceed just as in Section 6 to deﬁne a local moduli
space which is an open set in H3(M, R). With k > 7/2 we deﬁne the Sobolev space
E = {α ∈L2
k(Λ3) : dα = 0
and
πµd∗α = 0}.
and proceed as before, using the function
F(α) = P2(∗0 ∗α)
where ∗0 is the G2 metric at the critical point, and as before ∗depends on α. The
derivative on exact forms at the critical point is then P2(∗Jdψ) and the formal argu-
ment of nondegeneracy just proved shows that this is injective.
For surjectivity of the derivative we need to prove that if dψ, with ψ ∈C∞(g), satisﬁes
πµd∗dψ = 0 then there exists ν such that
dψ = P2
4
3π1(dν) + π7(dν) −π27(dν)

But dψ = π1(dψ) + π7(dψ) + π27(dψ) so from (38) and (39)
dψ = π27(dψ)
and we can take ν = −ψ.
We can thus use the implicit function theorem again. The only other result we need
is the regularity of Einstein metrics (see [1], 5.26) to pass from a Sobolev space to a
C∞metric, and for this we can take k > 9/2 in the Sobolev space.
We have here produced one use of the implicit function theorem to produce the moduli
space, as was suggested in [7].
35

7.5
Geometry of the moduli space
The natural diﬀerential geometry on the moduli space is again determined by the
critical value of our functional Φ. From (32) we have the function
Φ([Ω]) = 1
6
Z
M
Ω∧∗Ω= 1
6([Ω] ∪[∗Ω])(M)
on the open set U ⊂H3(M, R) parametrizing the G2-structures. We have, by analogy
with (17)
Proposition 22 Let M be an irreducible G2-manifold, and U ⊂H3(M, R) a local
moduli space.
Then the Hessian of the function Φ([Ω]) deﬁnes a metric on U of
signature (1, b3 −1).
Proof:
From (18) the metric is a positive multiple of
Z
M
DΘ( ˙Ω) ∧˙Ω
where ˙Ωis an inﬁnitesimal deformation of a G2 structure, and from (20) this is
Z
M
4
3∗π1( ˙Ω) + ∗π7( ˙Ω) −∗π27( ˙Ω)

∧˙Ω
Both ˙Ωand DΘ( ˙Ω) are closed, so we can replace ˙Ωby its harmonic representative
α. But π7α deﬁnes a harmonic 1-form and since the Ricci tensor is zero for a G2-
manifold, any harmonic 1-form is covariant constant by Bochner’s theorem. Thus
irreducibility implies that the harmonic 3-forms decompose as a 1-dimensional space
of multiples of Ωand its b3 −1-dimensional orthogonal space which is the image of
π27. Then
([α], [α]) = 4
3
Z
M
∥π1α∥2 −
Z
M
∥π27α∥2
as required.
✷
Remark:
Note that ∗identiﬁes Λ3W ∗and Λ4W ∗as G2 representation spaces, and
consequently the orbit of the 4-form ∗Ωunder GL(7, R) is also open. We could there-
fore rederive the characterization of G2-manifolds through an invariant functional on
4-forms instead of 3-forms. One approach to this is symplectic: we ﬁx ǫ ∈Λ7W ∗, and
identify Λ4W ∗∼= (Λ3W ∗)∗via the natural pairing. Then the product
Λ3W ∗× Λ4W ∗∼= T ∗(Λ3W ∗)
36

and Proposition 18 tells us that the set of pairs (Ω, ∗Ω) ∈Λ3W ∗×Λ4W ∗is the graph
of the derivative of the function 18φ/7 on Λ3W ∗and so is Lagrangian. Identifying
Λ3W ∗× Λ4W ∗the other way round with T ∗(Λ4W ∗), this submanifold is also the
graph of the derivative of a function ψ on Λ4W ∗, which is the Legendre transform of
18φ/7. Since φ is homogeneous of degree 7/3 in xi, it follows that ξi is homogeneous
of degree 4/3. Thus xi = ∂ψ/∂ξi is homogeneous of degree 3/4 and ψ of degree 7/4
in ξi. In particular since 6φ = Ω∧∗Ω, we have
6φ(Ω) =
X
i
xiξi =
X
i
ξi
∂ψ
∂ξi
= 7
4ψ(∗Ω)
and so the functional Φ on the 3-forms Ωcan be replaced by the functional
Ψ(Θ) = 7
24
Z
M
ψ(Θ)
on the 4-form Θ = ∗Ω.
The precise algebraic form of ψ(Θ) is as follows. For Θ ∈Λ4W ∗, given v, w ∈W, we
have ι(v)ι(w)Θ ∈Λ2W ∗. The map v ∧w 7→ι(v)ι(w)Θ deﬁnes a linear map
CΘ : Λ2W →Λ2W ∗.
The determinant of CΘ is a vector in L2 where L is the top exterior power of Λ2W ∗.
The highest exterior power of Λ2V for any vector space V of dimension n is canonically
isomorphic to (ΛnV )n−1 so in our case det CΘ is a well-deﬁned element of
(Λ7W ∗)12
and det C1/12
Θ
is a volume form, which will give an invariant integrand. A calculation
using the standard forms ϕ and ∗ϕ shows that ψ is in fact a nonzero multiple of
det C1/12
Θ
.
