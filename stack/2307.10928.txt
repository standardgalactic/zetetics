ABSTRACT
Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because aligning
to human values requires the composition of multiple skills and the required set
of skills varies depending on the instruction. Recent studies have evaluated the
performance of LLMs in two ways, (1) automatic evaluation on several indepen-
dent benchmarks and (2) human or machined-based evaluation giving an overall
score to the response. However, both settings are coarse-grained evaluations, not
considering the nature of user instructions that require instance-wise skill com-
position, which limits the interpretation of the true capabilities of LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on
Alignment SKill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol that can be used for
both model-based and human-based evaluation which decomposes coarse-level
scoring to an instance-wise skill set-level. Specifically, we define 12 fine-grained
skills needed for LLMs to follow open-ended user instructions and construct an
evaluation set by allocating a set of skills for each instance. Additionally, by anno-
tating the target domains and difficulty level for each instance, FLASK provides
a holistic view with a comprehensive analysis of a model’s performance depend-
ing on skill, domain, and difficulty. Through using FLASK, we compare multiple
open-sourced and proprietary LLMs and observe highly-correlated findings be-
tween model-based and human-based evaluations. FLASK enables developers to
more accurately measure the model performance and how it can be improved by
analyzing factors that make LLMs proficient in particular skills. For practition-
ers, FLASK can be used to recommend suitable models for particular situations
through comprehensive comparison among various LLMs. We release the evalua-
tion data and code implementation at github.com/kaistAI/FLASK and an interac-
tive demo at kaistai.github.io/FLASK.

INTRODUCTION
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown an impressive capability for aligning to human val-
ues, such as responding in a helpful, honest, and harmless manner (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,
2022a;b; Kim et al., 2023c; Korbak et al., 2023; Askell et al., 2021). In particular, techniques
such as instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have signifi-
cantly improved this ability by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM on diverse tasks or user preferences
(Ouyang et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). Recent studies have claimed that
open-sourced models trained through dataset distillation from proprietary models almost close the
performance gap with the proprietary LLMs by assessing models on only binary human/machine-
based preference (Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). In contrast, the evaluation
of open-sourced models on multiple academic benchmarks with automated metrics highlights that

Table 1: Comparison of open-sourced and proprietary models with FLASK evaluation. The model
size is 13B for VICUNA, ALPACA and 70B for LLAMA2 Chat. The best and second best perfor-
mance is shown in bold and underline respectively. We use GPT-4 as the evaluator (ORACLE LM)
for model-based evaluation.
open-sourced models are not sufficient enough to imitate proprietary models, necessitating a proper
evaluation setting (Gudibande et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). These inconsistent observations
imply that the evaluation of the alignment of LLMs to human values is challenging due to two rea-
sons. First, open-ended user instructions usually require a composition of multiple abilities, which
makes measurement with a single metric insufficient. Second, user instructions are task-agnostic,
indicating that the combination of multiple abilities varies depending on the instruction and a fixed
set of metrics for all instances is not applicable.
Currently, evaluation of LLMs primarily assesses their performance on multiple independent bench-
marks using automatic metrics (accuracy, ROUGE, etc.) or by assigning an overall score to the
model response based on human or model-based preference (Longpre et al., 2023a; Wang et al.,
2023b; Xu et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023). However, both evaluation set-
2

Preprint
tings are insufficient (in comprehensiveness and interpretability) because they fail to account for the
combinations of skills required by the user instruction for each instance. For automated evaluation,
benchmarks separately target different skills, domains, and difficulties, such as GSM8K (Cobbe
et al., 2021) for logical correctness, and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) for truthfulness, limiting scal-
ability. Also, relying on these automatic evaluations limits interpretability and reliability because
only task-wise analysis is possible and automatic metrics are sensitive to surface forms (Krishna
et al., 2021). Similarly, evaluating the performance of models by assigning overall scores based on
preference hinders a comprehensive interpretation. Because there could be multiple axes to evaluate
the response such as completeness, factuality, etc, merely assigning a single score does not tell the
whole story. Instead, we need to evaluate the model’s performance using fine-grained criteria to
comprehend the model from various perspectives. Although many recent works have studied multi-
metric or fine-grained evaluation of LLMs, they mainly focus on a fixed metric set across instances
for specific tasks, not applicable to the task-agnostic evaluation setting for LLM alignment (Liu
et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022; Jain et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022; Min et al., 2023;
Krishna et al., 2023).
To address the limitations of current evaluation settings, we propose FLASK (Fine-grained
Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment SKill Sets), an evaluation protocol that improves
the conventional coarse-grained scoring process into a more fine-grained scoring setup, allowing
instance-wise task-agnostic skill evaluation depending on the given instruction. We define 4 pri-
mary abilities which are divided into 12 fine-grained skills to evaluate the performance of lan-
guage models comprehensively: Logical Thinking (Logical Correctness, Logical Robust-
ness, Logical Efficiency), Background Knowledge (Factuality, Commonsense Understanding),
Problem Handling (Comprehension, Insightfulness, Completeness, Metacognition), and User
Alignment (Conciseness, Readability, Harmlessness). We also provide annotation of the relevant
set of skills (a skill set), domains, and the difficulty level for each instance. Then, evaluators as-
sign a score from a range of 1 to 5 for each skill allocated for the instance, where the evaluators
could be human evaluators or state-of-the-art LLMs1. Through this evaluation process, FLASK pro-
vides a holistic view of the performance of LLMs by enabling a thorough analysis of the model’s
performance depending on the skill set, target domain, and difficulty.
By applying FLASK to both model-based and human-based evaluation, we compare and analyze
open-sourced and proprietary LLMs with varying model sizes and fine-tuning strategies, as shown
in Figure 1 and Table 1. We present several findings:
• We observe that current open-sourced LLMs significantly underperform proprietary LLMs
for Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities by approximately
25% and 10% respectively even for state-of-the-art open-sourced models.
• We observe that different skills require different model sizes to effectively acquire them.
For example, while the acquisition of skills such as Conciseness and Insightfulness satu-
rates after some scale, skills such as Logical Correctness are acquired more effectively for
larger models.
• We show that even state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs struggle on FLASK-HARD set, a
subset of FLASK evaluation set where only challenging instances are selected, up to 50%
performance degradation for some skills compared to the performance on the whole set.
Comprehensive analysis of LLMs through FLASK is important and practical for both the develop-
ers and practitioners. For model developers, FLASK enables accurate interpretation of the model’s
current state, making action items clear towards developing better-aligned models. For example, the
results of FLASK suggest the open-sourced community should focus on developing base models
possessing strong Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities while compa-
nies developing proprietary LLMs should develop models performing well on the FLASK-HARD
set. For practitioners, the fine-grained comparison of different LLMs through FLASK facilitates
recommendations of suitable models for each situation.

2.1
HOLISTIC EVALUATION OF LLMS
Holistic evaluation of LLMs is important to analyze the strengths and limitations of models and
to address potential risks (Shevlane et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gehrmann et al., 2022; Chia
et al., 2023; Laskar et al., 2023). To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LLMs, many
works have assessed models on multiple independent benchmarks using automated metrics, such
as accuracy for knowledge/reasoning tasks or ROUGE for long-form text generation (Chung et al.,
2022; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Suzgun et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022c; Gao et al., 2021; Zhong et al.,
2023). To assess multiple aspects of the model response, multi-metric evaluation settings have been
proposed, providing a more comprehensive perspective of the model performance beyond accuracy
(Liang et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2023; Lee
et al., 2022). Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate LLMs on subjective tasks such as fact verification
or long-form summarization, recent works have proposed fine-grained atomic evaluation settings
(Min et al., 2023; Krishna et al., 2023). Especially, Wu et al. (2023a); Lightman et al. (2023) show
that fine-grained evaluation of model responses could be utilized for better rewards for training. In
FLASK, we adopt an instance-wise fine-grained multi-metric setting, which distinguishes it from
previous works and is more applicable to evaluate the general capabilities of LLMs.
2.2
ALIGNMENT OF LLMS
Aligning pre-trained LLMs to human values can be achieved through different fine-tuning tech-
niques such as supervised instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF). For instruction tuning, various techniques have shown effectiveness such as task and model
scaling (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022c; Chung et al., 2022), dataset dis-
tillation (Chiang et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Dettmers et al., 2023; Geng et al.,
2023; Gao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), instruction generation (Ye et al., 2023c; Honovich et al.,
2022b), data augmentation through model-generated response (Wang et al., 2022b; Honovich et al.,
2022a; Kim et al., 2023b), expert training and retrieval (Jang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Ye
et al., 2022), multilingual instruction tuning (Muennighoff et al., 2022) and in-context instruction
learning (Ye et al., 2023a). For RLHF, using fine-grained rewards (Wu et al., 2023a; Lightman et al.,
2023), training on synthetic feedback (Bai et al., 2022b; Kim et al., 2023c), applying reinforcement
learning during pretraining (Korbak et al., 2023), and reducing the action space (Ramamurthy et al.,
2022) has shown to better control the model’s response to make LLMs aligned to human values.
However, a comprehensive analysis and comparison between various user-aligned models trained
with different techniques is yet to be studied in sufficient detail.

FLASK
We introduce FLASK, a fine-grained skill set-based evaluation protocol for assessing the alignment
of language models. We define 4 primary abilities, divided into 12 skills, that are necessary to
follow user instructions in a desirable manner in Section 3.1. Then, we specify the detailed process
of the evaluation dataset construction (Section 3.2) and the fine-grained evaluation process (Section
3.3). FLASK allows comprehensive comparison between various LLMs, listed in Section 3.4. For
evaluation, we compare human annotators with a state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023),
referred to as ORACLE LM in this work, as evaluators.
3.1
SKILL SET CATEGORIZATION
Expanding upon previous research on language model evaluation (Sugawara & Aizawa, 2016; Sug-
awara et al., 2017; Radziwill & Benton, 2017; Schlegel et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2021; Liu et al.,
2023), we define a taxonomy of skills to comprehensively evaluate the performance of LLMs. Our
taxonomy provides a systematic framework for classifying the key dimensions of pertinent skills,
encompassing a broad range of single-turn, natural instructions written in English. Based on the
skill categorization of Rogers et al. (2021) which was specifically proposed for question answer-
ing and reading comprehension, we recategorize skills suitable for LLM alignment. Our proposed
4

Preprint
categorization consists of four primary abilities where each ability is further divided into 2-4 skills,
yielding a total of 12 skills:
• Logical Thinking refers to the ability to apply reasoning, critical thinking, and de-
ductive skills when processing and responding to instructions. In order to do so, models
should generate a logically correct final answer (LOGICAL CORRECTNESS) while pre-
serving generalizability during the step-by-step logical process without any contradiction
(LOGICAL ROBUSTNESS). Also, the logical process should be efficient and not contain
any unnecessary steps (LOGICAL EFFICIENCY).
• Background Knowledge comprises the capacity to generate responses by accessing
a broad repository of general and domain-specific information. This ability requires the
model to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to questions or instructions
requiring factual (FACTUALITY) or commonsense knowledge (COMMONSENSE UNDER-
STANDING).
• Problem Handling pertains to the proficiency in addressing obstacles and challenges
that emerge while processing and responding to user instructions. This category encom-
passes the model’s capacity to understand the implicit and explicit purpose and require-
ments of the instruction (COMPREHENSION), develop creative perspectives or interpreta-
tions of the instruction (INSIGHTFULNESS), handle the instruction by providing in-depth
and in-breadth information (COMPLETENESS), and be aware of its own capability to an-
swer the instruction (METACOGNITION).
• User Alignment represents the ability to empathize with the user and align its re-
sponses to the user’s intentions, preferences, and expectations, rather than focusing on
the accuracy of the model answer. This category encompasses the model’s ability to struc-
ture the answer to promote the users’ readability (READABILITY), presenting a concise
response for the reader without unnecessary information (CONCISENESS), and considering
potential risks to user safety (HARMLESSNESS).
We ensure that each skill provides a broad range of criteria to evaluate the performance of various
LLMs holistically. Note that our taxonomy does not dictate a one-to-one correspondence between
individual instructions and specific skills. Instead, different instructions usually necessitate the com-
bination of multiple skills (referred to as skill set) in the process of generating a desirable response.
We illustrate the specific definition and application for each skill in Table 11.
3.2
EVALUATION DATA CONSTRUCTION
For constructing the evaluation data, we collect input and output pairs from various datasets, modify
the collected instances, and filter based on length criteria, yielding a total of 1,700 instances sourced
from 120 datasets. We first collect input (instruction) and output (reference answer) pairs from
diverse English NLP datasets that are either multi-task datasets (e.g. Self-Instruct (Wang et al.,
2022b), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020)) or single-task datasets (e.g. GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021),
FEVER(Thorne et al., 2018)). For single-task datasets, we restrict them to account for at most 20
instances per dataset for diversity. After collection, we modify the instances by manually writing
instructions for datasets that do not include instructions. Lastly, we remove instances where the
input length is longer than 2048. More details including the list of source datasets are provided in
Appendix H.
For each evaluation instance, we annotate the metadata which consists of 1) the essential skills to
follow the instruction, 2) target domains, and 3) the difficulty level of the instructions. We first
validate that human labelers and ORACLE LM have a high correlation for the metadata annotation
on a subset of 200 instances. We have observed 95.22% acceptance for skill annotation, 81.32% ac-
ceptance for domain annotation, and 0.774 Pearson correlation for difficulty annotation. Therefore,
since the model-based annotation has acceptable noise and high correlation to human labelers, we
utilize the ORACLE LM for metadata annotation to reduce the burden of human annotations. We
provide more details on validating the annotation of ORACLE LM in Appendix E.2.
For the selection of necessary skills, the ORACLE LM selects the top-3 most essential skills required
to follow the instructions for each instance, from the 12 skills defined in Section 3.1. To do this,
we provide the instruction, reference answer, and descriptions of all 12 skills to the ORACLE LM.
5

Preprint
For target domain annotation, we identify 10 domains: Humanities, Language, Culture, Health, His-
tory, Natural Science, Math, Social Science, Technology, and Coding by modifying the Wikipedia
categorization of Reid et al. (2022). Lastly, for difficulty level annotation, we divide the difficulty
level into 5 levels based on the extent of required domain knowledge by referencing Webb’s depth
of knowledge (Webb, 1997; 1999) and NIH proficiency scale2: simple lifestyle knowledge, ad-
vanced lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major-level knowledge, and expert-level
knowledge where we map each level into a level from 1 to 5 in this work. Based on the difficulty
annotation, we additionally construct the FLASK-HARD subset for comparison of state-of-the-art
LLMs on challenging settings. For FLASK-HARD construction, we select instances that are an-
notated as expert-level knowledge (level 5) and have predefined reference answers, yielding a total
of 65 instances. Details of the metadata annotation process are provided in Appendix C and the
detailed statistics of the evaluation dataset for each metadata are provided in Appendix D.
3.3
EVALUATION PROCESS
Utilizing the annotated metadata for each instance, we evaluate and analyze the response of each
target model in a fine-grained manner. Given the evaluation instruction, reference answer, response
of the target model, and pre-defined scoring criteria for each selected skill from Section 3.2, eval-
uators (either human annotators or the ORACLE LM), allocate a score ranging from 1 to 5 based
on the scoring criteria. For example, if the selected skills are Factuality, Harmlessness, and Logical
Correctness, evaluators give a score for each of the selected skills based on the pre-defined scoring
criteria. We emphasize this instance-wise multi-metric evaluation approach is what mainly distin-
guishes our work from previous evaluation settings, enabling task-agnostic evaluation. After the
evaluators assign a score for each skill of the instance, we aggregate the scores based on the skill,
domain, and difficulty level for fine-grained analysis. Through this analysis, we can understand how
a specific target model performs on a specific composition of metadata, such as a specific difficulty
for a specific domain. The scoring criteria for each skill are provided in Appendix I.1.
3.4
MODELS
We evaluate LLMs with varying model sizes, training techniques, and training datasets. We evaluate
several proprietary LLMs where the model responses are provided through private APIs with model
details hidden from the end users. These include 1) OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022), 2) Ope-
nAI’s INSTRUCTGPT (text-davinci-003) (Ouyang et al., 2022), 3) Google’s BARD (Google, 2023),
and 4) Anthropic’s CLAUDE (Anthropic, 2023)3. For open-sourced models which are fine-tuned
based on human-curated datasets or responses from proprietary models, we compare 1) ALPACA
13B (Taori et al., 2023) which is a fine-tuned LLAMA model (Touvron et al., 2023a) on 52,000
instructions and responses generated by text-davinci-0034, 2) VICUNA 13B(Chiang et al., 2023)
which is a LLAMA model fine-tuned on 70K responses of GPT-3.5 available through ShareGPT,
3) WIZARDLM 13B (Xu et al., 2023), a LLAMA model fine-tuned on 250K instructions and re-
sponses augmented by GPT-3.5 through instruction evolving, 4) T ¨ULU 13B (Wang et al., 2023b), a
LLAMA model fine-tuned on 490K training instances which are a mixture of human and machine-
generated instructions and responses, 5) LLAMA2 Chat 70B(Touvron et al., 2023b), a chat-variant
of LLAMA2 model fine-tuned with instruction tuning and RLHF. To evaluate LLMs with various
model sizes, we also compare T ¨ULU 7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B models. Also, to compare the effect
of different fine-tuning datasets, we compare models finetuned on SHAREGPT5, CODE-ALPACA
(Chaudhary, 2023), ALPACA, FLAN V2 (Longpre et al., 2023a), and EVOL-INSTRUCT (Xu et al.,
2023) respectively using the model checkpoints provided by Wang et al. (2023b). For the response
generation of each target model, we set the temperature to 0.7 and set the max generation sequences
as 1024.

3For proprietary models, we use the most recent model versions at the period of May 2023 - June 2023.
4Because the official ALPACA 13B checkpoint is not released at the point of conducting evaluation, we use
the open-instruct-stanford-alpaca-13b model weights provided by Wang et al. (2023b).

MODEL-BASED EVALUATION
4.1
EVALUATION SETTING
Although model-based evaluation has much room for improvement in terms of reliability, it has
the advantage of scalability, allowing many extensive analyses in diverse settings while showing a
moderate correlation between human labelers (Dubois et al., 2023). Following Liu et al. (2023);
Chiang et al. (2023), we use GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) for model-based evaluation since it shows the
highest correlation with human labelers among model-based evaluation baselines as observed in
Table 2 (Pearson correlation of 0.685) 6. We show the result of using another model (CLAUDE) for
model-based evaluation in Appendix A.5. For the model-based evaluation process, we enforce the
evaluation model to generate a rationale before generating the score for each skill through prompting,
motivated by the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) for the evaluation
of LLMs (Zheng et al., 2023).
6We use the gpt-4-0613 model version for model-based evaluation.

RESULTS
Open-sourced models significantly underperform proprietary models on particular skills.
First, to compare open-sourced models with proprietary models, we compare GPT-3.5, VICUNA,
and WIZARDLM where the latter two models are trained with GPT-3.5 responses during instruc-
tion tuning. As shown in Figure 2a, VICUNA and WIZARDLM show similar performance across
all skills. In contrast to the claim of Xu et al. (2023), the result of Figure 2a implies that the effect
of complex instructions for fine-tuning is not significant when the base model, teacher model, and
training configuration are the same. By comparing GPT-3.5 and the other two open-sourced mod-
els (VICUNA and WIZARDLM), we observe that Problem Handling and User Alignment
abilities can be almost fully imitated, such as Metacognition, Readability, Conciseness, and Harm-
lessness. However, a large gap is observed in especially Logical Thinking and Background
Knowledge abilities, which are Logical Robustness, Logical Correctness, Logical Efficiency, Fac-
tuality, and Commonsense Understanding skills. This result aligns with Gudibande et al. (2023)
which shows that the open-sourced models only imitate the style of the proprietary models rather
than the factuality. We also observe a similar tendency for other open-sourced models as shown
in Figure 1 and Table 1. In Figure 2c, we find that both open-sourced models significantly under-
perform GPT-3.5 in Natural Science, Math, and Coding domains. We conjecture that failures of
open-sourced models on these domains are due to a lack of domain-specific training data during
pre-training and the size of the backbone model (LLAMA 13B).
We also analyze the performance by difficulty level, shown in Figure 3. Both open-sourced models
show consistently poor performances regardless of difficulty level on Logical Thinking and
Background Knowledge abilities. Moreover, through our analysis on the FLASK-HARD set
shown in Figure 2b, the gap between open-sourced models and GPT-3.5 enlarges especially for
Conciseness, and Logical Correctness compared to the result on the whole FLASK evaluation set in
Figure 2a. This opposes the result of Xu et al. (2023) which states that WIZARDLM outperforms
GPT-3.5 on difficult test sets. We conjecture that the proportion difference in necessary abilities
between the evaluation set of WIZARDLM and FLASK-HARD shown in Figure 14 could have
caused the disagreement.

Figure 4: The performance of T ¨ULU shown for each skill depending on the model scale (7B, 13B,
30B, 65B). While skills such as Logical Robustness and Logical Correctness largely benefit from
model scaling, smaller models also perform well on skills such as Readability and Metacognition.
Different skills require different model sizes.
We analyze the effect of the model scale for each
skill by comparing T ¨ULU 7B, 13B, 30B, and 65B shown in Figure 4. Overall, we can observe
that larger models lead to better performance, which aligns with the result of Chung et al. (2022);
Wei et al. (2022a). However, the range of improvement varies across different skills. For example,
skills such as Readability, Harmlessness, Conciseness, and Metacognition show slow improvement
as the model scales up. On the other hand, skills such as Logical Correctness, Logical Robustness,
Logical Efficiency, and Completeness show rapid improvements. Especially, Logical Efficiency
skill almost shows an emergent behavior when the model size scales from 13B to 30B (Wei et al.,
2022a). Through FLASK, we confirm the results of Gudibande et al. (2023) that skills that require
logical reasoning or fact retrieval are benefited largely from the model scale. Interestingly, we
observe that for some skills, the performance saturates after a particular scale; Logical Efficiency and
Conciseness saturates after 30B, Insightfulness saturates after 13B and Readability, Harmlessness,
and Metacognition saturates after 7B. This implies that different skills require different model sizes.
We additionally observe that different skills require different training steps in Appendix A.4.
By analyzing the effect of model scaling for different levels of difficulty for each skill, we find
that scaling the model size is more effective for easier instructions as shown in Figure 5. Larger
models of T ¨ULU reduce the performance gap with GPT-3.5, especially for the simple lifestyle
knowledge difficulty (Level 1), while the gap increases for higher difficulties. This implies that
scaling the model size might not be the single solution to improve these skills, especially for harder
instructions. Instead, constructing better base models through optimal pretraining or advanced fine-
tuning techniques such as fine-grained RLHF (Wu et al., 2023a; Lightman et al., 2023) could have an
orthogonal effect with mode scaling for reducing the gap with proprietary models. As a preliminary
experiment, we show the effect of RLHF training after supervised instruction tuning in Appendix
A.3. We also provide the result of GPT-3.5, T ¨ULU-7B, 13B, 30B, 65B for each domain shown in
Figure 29.

FLASK enables comparison over different
fine-tuning datasets.
We analyze the effect
of different fine-tuning datasets by fine-tuning
LLAMA 13B model with SHAREGPT, FLAN
V2, ALPACA, CODE-ALPACA, and EVOL-
INSTRUCT data, respectively. The results are
shown in Figure 6. First, the model trained on
FLAN V2 underperforms other baselines for
most skills.
Because FLAN V2 consists of
relatively short responses, training on FLAN
V2 leads to failure for instructions that require
long-form text generation.
However, for the
evaluation subset where the length of the ref-
erence answer is shorter than 5 words, FLAN
V2 shows similar performance to other base-
lines as illustrated in Figure 13.
This indi-
cates that while FLAN V2 is effective for in-
structions that require short responses, it is not
suitable for long-form text generation.
Sec-
ond, by comparing the effect of training on
ALPACA and CODE-ALPACA, we can observe
that CODE-ALPACA model outperforms AL-
PACA on Logical Thinking ability, indi-
cating that domain-specific instruction tuning on the Coding domain leads to improved Logical
Thinking.
Third, by comparing the result of models trained with SHAREGPT and EVOL-
INSTRUCT, although the instructions of EVOL-INSTRUCT are more difficult than SHAREGPT as
shown in Figure 12, using more difficult training instructions does not lead to significant changes.
We provide skill proportion, domain proportion, and difficulty comparison between different fine-
tuning instructions in Appendix A.1.
Proprietary models also struggle on the FLASK-HARD set.
We also compare the performance
of various proprietary models (GPT-3.5, BARD, CLAUDE, INSTRUCTGPT) on the FLASK evalu-
ation set as shown in Figure 7a. For all skills of Problem Handling, CLAUDE shows the best
performance while for other skills, GPT-3.5 shows the best performance. INSTRUCTGPT shows
the worst performance across most skills because, unlike other models, INSTRUCTGPT often pro-
vides short responses while not fully addressing the intention of given instruction, accounting for
performing best on the Conciseness skill. On the contrary, BARD largely fails on Conciseness skill.
Qualitatively, we observe that BARD usually gives additional information that the user did not ex-
plicitly ask for, which potentially leads to better Completeness but worse Conciseness. We provide
the performance comparison between various proprietary models for each domain in Figure 30.

HARD evaluation set. Exact numbers are reported in Table 9 and Table 10.
Furthermore, we compare the performance of different proprietary models on FLASK-HARD set
shown in Figure 7b. First, we observe that the performance significantly degrades for Logical
Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities compared to the User Alignment abil-
ity. Also, by comparing other models with GPT-4, we observe that there is a large gap for Logical
Correctness, Insightfulness, and Metacognition. Interestingly, even the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model
also performs poorly for Logical Correctness and Factuality skills on the FLASK-HARD set. This
suggests there are huge to improve in those abilities even for the proprietary models. While analysis
on the model scale and training techniques, and training data is infeasible for proprietary models due
to limited information on the models, FLASK-HARD provides action items for companies develop-
ing proprietary models by focusing on challenging settings where there is currently much room for
improvement.

HUMAN-BASED EVALUATION
5.1
EVALUATION SETTING
We conduct a human evaluation on 200 instances randomly sampled from the whole FLASK evalu-
ation set. We recruited 10 labelers who have majored in various fields including computer science,
mathematics, economics, business, chemistry, etc. We evaluate 4 models: 1) GPT-3.5, 2) BARD,
3) VICUNA-13B, and 4) ALPACA-13B. Using the same instructions as the model-based evaluation
in Section 4.1, human labelers also evaluate the response of each model from a range of 1-5 for
each model. Details of the human evaluation process including the user interface are provided in
Appendix E.1.
5.2
RESULTS
Human-based and model-based evaluation show similar tendencies.
We compare the result
of human-based and model-based evaluation in Figure 8. Overall, the tendency is similar between
the two evaluation settings: the ALPACA model results in the worst performance for most of the
skills and VICUNA has a significant performance gap between GPT-3.5 and BARD on Logical
Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities compared to other skills. However, we note
that both human-based and model-based evaluation settings are necessary since both settings are
not perfect. For human-based evaluation, we observe that central tendency bias (Goldfarb-Tarrant
et al., 2020) exists where labelers tend to label middle-scores more often for the Likert scale, lead-

ing to a more uniform distribution than model-based evaluation shown in Figure 8a. Also, human
labelers are prone to fatigue since the annotation task requires knowledge-intensive evaluation, such
as evaluating a coding-related response or a response containing many factual statements to ver-
ify. On the other hand, model-based evaluation is known to possess style and verbosity bias (Wang
et al., 2023b; Dubois et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023), where the evaluation model tends to prefer
responses similar to its own generation styles and responses with longer lengths. By comparing
the performance of GPT-3.5 and BARD model for two evaluation settings in Figure 8, we observe
that while for model-based evaluation, GPT-3.5 outperforms BARD on all skills except Insightful-
ness and Completeness, for human-based evaluation, BARD additionally outperforms GPT-3.5 on
Logical Correctness, Factuality, Commonsense Understanding, and Harmlessness. This implies that
the evaluation model (GPT-4) might prefer GPT-3.5 response styles compared to BARD response
styles due to style bias. We leave mitigating the limitation of both human-based and model-based
evaluation as future work.
To quantitatively analyze the correlation between human-based and model-based evaluation, we
measure the Spearman, Kendall-Tau, and Pearson correlation, following Liu et al. (2023). We com-
pare different ORACLE LMS, which are GPT-3.5, CLAUDE, and GPT-4 and report the correlation
with human-based evaluation in Table 2. Compared to GPT-3.5 and CLAUDE, GPT-4 shows the
highest correlation with human labelers, consistent with the result of the GPT-4 model showing the
highest correlation on coarse-grained evaluation setting of Dubois et al. (2023). Indeed, using GPT-4

as the evaluator for the task-agnostic setting of FLASK shows comparable human-model correlation
compared to the task-specific evaluation setting of Liu et al. (2023), indicating that task-agnostic
fine-grained analysis is feasible without losing correlation with human labelers through FLASK.
Inter-labeler agreement varies depending on the skill.
We analyze the inter-labeler agreement
of both human-based evaluation and model-based evaluation using Krippendorff’s alpha (Hughes,
2021). For human-based evaluation, because we assign 3 labelers for each instance, we measure
the agreement between 3 labelers. For model-based evaluation, we set the decoding temperature as
1.0 for nondeterministic generations while keeping the ORACLE LM (GPT-4) fixed and measure the
agreement between 3 runs. First, the overall agreement of inter-labeler agreement for human-based
evaluation is 0.477, indicating a moderate correlation while the agreement is 0.833 for model-based
evaluation. Second, we analyze the human-human agreement, model-model agreement, and human-
model correlation for each skill as shown in Table 3. While skills such as Logical Correctness and
Commonsense Understanding have a high agreement or correlation for all settings, skills such as
Readability and Conciseness do not. This implies that more subjectivity tends to exist in User
Alignment ability than Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities con-
sistent for all settings. We expect that disagreement between labelers for User Alignment ability
could be utilized for additional training signals or personalization for subjective tasks (Gordon et al.,
2021; Salemi et al., 2023). We explore agreement between different ORACLE LMS in Appendix A.6.

DISCUSSION
6.1
FLASK FOR DEVELOPERS
FLASK enables model developers to more accurately analyze the performance of their own models
by comparing them with other models in the axis of skill, domain, and difficulty. The fine-grained
analysis of FLASK suggests detailed action items for intermediate model checkpoints. For exam-
ple, if a developer’s model is underperforming on high-difficulty instructions in the code domain,
one of the action items would be to increase the ratio of challenging coding problems during train-
ing. Specifically, developers working on open-sourced LLMs can compare the performance with
proprietary LLMs and try to close the gap between them, especially for Logical Thinking and
Background Knowledge abilities. On the other hand, developers working on proprietary LLMs
can devise different methods to enhance the performance of their own models on the FLASK-HARD
set. As shown in Figure 7b, there is much room for improvement for state-of-the-art proprietary
LLMs on FLASK-HARD. Similar to the role of Wang et al. (2022a); Longpre et al. (2023a) for
13

Preprint
instruction-tuned LLMs and Longpre et al. (2023b); Xie et al. (2023) for pre-trained LLMs, FLASK
could be utilized for making better base models, making better training datasets, and making better
training techniques eventually.
6.2
FLASK FOR PRACTITIONERS
FLASK lets practitioners select appropriate LLMs for different situations, similar to the role of Jiang
et al. (2023). Using FLASK, practitioners can be informed of what models would be suitable for the
particular skill, domain, and difficulty. For example, if the end-use case is a harmless chatbot for
chit-chat, using 7B fine-tuned open-sourced models might be enough instead of relying on costly
API calls of proprietary LLMs. In contrast, it might be worth paying for API calls of proprietary
LLMs for tasks that are knowledge-intensive or require complex reasoning. Potentially, the result of
FLASK can be used to automatically route and recommend suitable LLMs depending on the user’s
instruction.
6.3
FLASK FOR DATASET CREATORS
Dataset creators could also use FLASK to analyze the distribution of their data. Because the meta-
data annotation process of FLASK is automatic and dynamic, meaning that the annotation could
be applied to any user instructions easily, dataset creators can conduct metadata annotation on their
own target test set. This allows analysis of the characteristic of the dataset and comparison with the
existing datasets, similar to the analysis shown in Appendix A.1 and Figure 14 (Chang et al., 2023).
7
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce FLASK, a fine-grained language skill set evaluation setting for the align-
ment of language models. We categorize 12 fine-grained skills to evaluate LLMs and annotate
necessary skills, the target domain, and the difficulty level for each instance. FLASK provides a
comprehensive and interpretable analysis of the capabilities of LLMs by allowing the analysis of
the performance depending on different skills, domains, and difficulty levels. By analyzing vari-
ous LLMs on model-based and human-based evaluation of FLASK, we suggest that open-sourced
community should focus on building better base models capable of better logical thinking and back-
ground knowledge, while proprietary LLM developers should focus on improving the performance
on the FLASK-HARD set, a challenging subset of FLASK. We expect that FLASK could be uti-
lized for making better base models and providing meaningful insights of various LLMs for both
developers and practitioners.

LIMITATION AND FUTURE WORK
8.1
LIMITATION OF EVALUATORS
As discussed in Section 5.2, both human and model evaluators possess limitations during evaluation.
Human labelers tend to show central tendency bias and are prone to annotation fatigue due to the
difficulty and wide scope of knowledge needed to evaluate each instance. These factors might
have caused the moderate inter-agreement between human labelers. We expect that using advanced
features such as document retrieval for fact verification (Min et al., 2023) or highlight hints (Krishna
et al., 2023) could mitigate this issue. On the other hand, the model-based evaluation shows bias in
preferring longer responses and in writing styles that are similar to the evaluation’s model writing
style. While model-based evaluation is more efficient in terms of time and cost as discussed in
Appendix E.3, we emphasize that evaluation in both settings is crucial to reliably figure out the true
capability of a language model. We leave mitigating the limitations for respective evaluation settings
as future work. Also, we did not extensively conduct human-based evaluations due to cost and time
constraints. For a more reliable setting, a larger number of labelers from diverse demographics could
be recruited and the human-based evaluation could be conducted on a larger set. Also, while we
evaluated only 4 models for human-based evaluation, a larger number of models could be evaluated
for future work.

8.2
SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
We restrict the scope of the current evaluation instance to be monolingual (including only English
user instructions), single-turn, language-focused, and zero-shot. We leave extension to multilingual
instructions, multi-turn, multi-modal, and few-shot in-context learning evaluation to future work.
Also, the FLASK-HARD subset only contains 65 instances, making the effect of outliers unavoid-
able when analyzing by each skill, domain, or difficulty. However, expansion to these axes could
be easily implemented once the instances are collected using the process described in Section 3.2,
because the metadata annotation is automatic and dynamic. Also, there might be use cases where
12 fine-grained skills are insufficient especially when FLASK is applied to a domain-specific set-
ting. Additionally, new abilities of LLMs are newly discovered (Wei et al., 2022a), indicating that
recategorization of the primary abilities and skills might be needed for future models possessing
potentially much more powerful abilities and skills.

ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS
A.1
ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT FINETUNING DATA
Through the metadata annotation process of FLASK, we can analyze not only the evaluation data
but also the instructions of fine-tuning data. To compare different fine-tuning datasets, we com-
pare SHAREGPT, FLAN V2, ALPACA, CODE-ALPACA, and EVOL-INSTRUCT data by randomly
sampling 200 instances. We first compare the primary ability and skill proportion for each training
data as shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10. While SHAREGPT and FLAN V2 show similar pro-
portions, EVOL-INSTRUCT focuses more on Logical Thinking and Problem Handling.
Also, ALPACA focuses on Problem Handling and User Alignment while CODE-ALPACA
mainly focuses on Logical Thinking. By comparing the domain proportion shown in Figure
11, we observe that SHAREGPT, CODE-ALPACA and EVOL-INSTRUCThave a large proportion of
the Coding and Technology domain while FLAN-V2 and ALPACA have a large proportion of Lan-
guage domain. Lastly, we compare the difficulty level of each instruction of training data shown in
Figure 12. Overall, ALPACA and FLAN V2 show relatively low difficulty while CODE-ALPACA
and SHAREGPT show moderate difficulty and EVOL-INSTRUCT shows the highest difficulty.
We also report the performance of different fine-tuning datasets on a subset of FLASK where only
the instances that have short reference answers (less than 5 words) are selected in Figure 13. Differ-
ent from the result of Figure 6, the performance gap between different training instructions reduces
especially for Logical Thinking and User Alignment. This indicates that the low perfor-
mance of FLAN V2 in Figure 6 is due to the failure to generate long-form responses rather than the
lack of ability. We leave exploring the effect of replacing the responses of FLAN V2 instruction to
longer responses as future work.

EFFECT OF TRAINING ON BETTER RESPONSES
We explore the effect of training on better response for each instruction by using better teacher
models for distillation-based instruction tuning. We compare ALPACA which is finetuned on the
responses of INSTRUCTGPT and GPT4-ALPACA which is finetuned on the responses of GPT-4.
GPT-4 model is known to show better performance than INSTRUCTGPT, also shown in Figure 7a,
being a better teacher model. We also illustrate the result of GPT-3.5 for comparison. As shown in
Figure 15, GPT4-ALPACA 13B outperforms ALPACA 13B for all skills. This shows that using better
responses during training leads to better performance. However, although GPT-4 is known to show
better performance than GPT-3.5, also shown in Figure 7a, GPT4-ALPACA underperforms GPT-
3.5 for all skills. This shows that although training on better responses improves the performance,
the enhancement is not enough. Instead, training on a better base model other than LLAMA 13B
model could lead to better performance.
A.3
EFFECT OF RLHF
We analyze the effect of RLHF training by comparing VICUNA-13B with STABLEVICUNA-13B7,
which additionally finetunes VICUNA model via RLHF on a mixture of OpenAssistant Conversa-
tions Dataset (OASST1) (K¨opf et al., 2023), GPT4All (Anand et al., 2023), and ALPACA (Taori
et al., 2023) training instances. The reward model to train STABLEVICUNA model is trained with
a mixture of OASST1, Anthropic HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a), and Stanford Human Preferences
Dataset (Askell et al., 2021). The result is shown in Table 4. Overall, applying the RLHF process
leads to improved Logical Thinking and impaired performance on the rest of the skills. We
conjecture that the performance degradation on most of the skills is due to the quality of the dataset
used for RLHF being worse than the dataset used during instruction tuning (SHAREGPT). However,
we leave a detailed analysis of the comparison of these fine-tuning datasets as future work. Even

though the performance degrades for most skills, the RLHF process leads to consistent improve-
ment on Logical Thinking, implying that using more advanced RLHF techniques (Lightman
et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023a) might reduce the gap of Logical Thinking ability between
open-sourced and proprietary LLMs.

FINE-TUNING STEPS VARIATION
We explore the effect of different fine-tuning steps by instruction-tuning a LLAMA 7B on
SHAREGPT for different numbers of epochs. We report the performance for each skill in Fig-
ure 16 where the training epoch of zero corresponds to LLAMA 7B model performance. Overall,
most of the skills are acquired during the first epoch. However, the performance tendency after the
first epoch varies depending on the skill. For skills such as Logical Correctness, Logical Efficiency,
Factuality, Completeness, and Conciseness, the performance improves consistently, Logical Cor-
rectness showing the biggest improvement. From the result of Figure 4 and Figure 16, we suggest

that Logical Correctness skill requires both extensive scale of the model and training steps for effec-
tive acquisition. On the other hand, the performance decreases after the first epoch for skills such as
Harmlessness, Readability, and Logical Robustness. These results show that different skills require
different training steps, similar to the result of the model scale of Figure 4. Therefore, we conjecture
that optimizing each skill using experts might lead to better performance (Shen et al., 2023; Jang
et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2022).
A.5
USING CLAUDE AS ORACLE LM FOR EVALUATION
We explore using CLAUDE as ORACLE LM instead of GPT-4. The result is shown in Figure 17.
By comparing with setting GPT-4 model as ORACLE-LM shown in Figure 1, we find that CLAUDE
gives better scores for Logical Thinking and worse scores for User Alignment overall.
Especially, different from the result of Figure 1, Figure 17 shows that open-sourced models such as
VICUNA largely reduce the gap with proprietary models for Logical Thinking and Factuality
abilities. Considering that the human-based evaluation shows an opposite result in Figure 8 and the
correlation with human labelers is lower for CLAUDE compared to GPT-4, we conjecture that this
tendency is due to CLAUDE not possessing much Logical Thinking and Factuality abilities as
clearly shown in Figure 7a. Therefore, we use GPT-4 as the ORACLE-LM as default. However, we
suggest using various ORACLE-LMS for model-based evaluation of FLASK if the ability between
evaluators is similar for closer simulation of human-based evaluation (Dubois et al., 2023).

ment between 3 different models similar to the setting of AlpacaFarm (Dubois et al., 2023). The
result shows that the overall inter-model agreement is 0.471 in Table 5. This is consistent with the
result of Dubois et al. (2023), showing that using inter-model evaluation shows similar inter-labeler
agreement to human-based evaluation. However, when we analyze the agreement for each skill in
Table 5, in contrast to the result of Table 3, inter-model show a different tendency with inter-labeler
agreement for human-based evaluation, showing the lowest agreement for Logical Robustness. We
conjecture that this is due to the inherent ability gap between each ORACLE LMS shown in Figure
7a, where the gap is evident for Logical Robustness and Logical Efficiency (Lee et al., 2023).
A.7
ADDITIONAL MODELS
We evaluate additional models which include 1) LLAMA2 Chat 13B, 2) VICUNA 7B, 3) VICUNA
33B, 4) and SELFEE 13B. For LLAMA2 Chat 13B, we compare with VICUNA 13B to compare the
effect of using better base models and LLAMA2 Chat 70B to compare the effect of the model size.
As shown in Figure 18, by comparing VICUNA 13B and LLAMA2 Chat, using better base models
leads to slight improvement for Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge while
the improvement is significant for Insightfulness and Completeness skill. However, LLAMA2 Chat
leads to worse Conciseness. Since the fine-tuning dataset is different for VICUNA and LLAMA2
Chat, further analysis is needed to analyze the effect of the base model.
Also, by comparing
LLAMA2 Chat 13B and 70B, we observe that using larger models leads to improved performance
overall, aligned with the result of Figure 4. For VICUNA 7B and VICUNA 33B, we compare with
VICUNA 13B to compare the effect of the model size. Note that only for VICUNA 33B, we use
version 1.3, which is one of the best-open-sourced models at the point of the experiment on Al-
pacaEval (Li et al., 2023b). As shown in Figure 19, using larger models leads to improved skills
overall. However, there still exists a significant gap between GPT-3.5 for Logical Thinking
and Background Knowledge abilities. For SELFEE (Ye et al., 2023b), which is a LLAMA
model instruction-tuned to give feedback and revise its own response iteratively, we compare with
VICUNA 13B and GPT-3.5 to confirm the effectiveness of self-revision. The result is shown in
Figure 20. We observe that SELFEE shows improved performance on Logical Robustness, Logical
Correctness, Insightfulness, Completeness while performing on par or worse compared to VICUNA
model. This implies that for LLAMA 13B model, using self-feedback and revision improves the
Insightfulness and Completeness while it does not reduce the gap between proprietary models for
Logical Thinking and Background Knowledge abilities.

BROADER RELATED WORK & BACKGROUND
B.1
EVALUATION OF LLMS
Conventionally, the performance of LLMs is measured by assessing the model on separate bench-
marks using automatic metrics such as accuracy for knowledge/reasoning tasks or ROUGE for long-
form text generation (Chung et al., 2022; Hendrycks et al., 2020; Suzgun et al., 2022; Wang et al.,
2022c; Gao et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2023). However, automatic metrics are based on surface-level
features, indicating the limitation in terms of comprehensiveness and correlation to actual model

performance (Gehrmann et al., 2022). Recently, to overcome the limitations of automatic metrics,
human-based or model-based evaluation has been adopted, usually evaluating the overall quality of
the model by annotating a binary preference or an overall scalar score. Although human-based eval-
uation is known to be more reliable, it is not scalable or easily reproducible (Ouyang et al., 2022;
Krishna et al., 2023). On the other hand, model-based evaluation, a more scalable and reproducible
option, has been widely used to simulate human-based evaluation with the cost of compromised
reliability to some extent (Dubois et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Chiang & yi Lee, 2023; Liu et al.,
2023; Zheng et al., 2023).
B.2
USING LLMS AS EVALUATORS
Recently, LLM evaluators are largely used to simulate human-based evaluation due to the cost and
time efficiency compared to human evaluation. However, using LLMs as evaluators have the limi-
tation of certain biases: position bias, verbosity, style bias (Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a),
where LLMs tend to prefer the first option, longer responses, responses having a similar style as its
own output. For the evaluation setting of FLASK, position bias is eliminated because we are giving
an absolute score instead of relying on a binary comparison. Also, by dividing the scoring scheme
into fine-grained skill-level factors, we try to mitigate the effect of verbosity and style bias. For
verbosity bias, we compare the correlation between response length and performance for Logical
Correctness and Completeness skill. As shown in Figure 21a, Completeness skill is inherently in-
fluenced by response length, showing a high correlation between response length and performance.
However, for Logical Correctness skill, shown in Figure 21b, the correlation decreased to some
extent, showing that dividing the scoring scheme into fine-grained skill-level factors mitigates ver-
bosity bias. We leave accurate rigorous comparisons and further solutions to mitigate biases as
future work.
C
DETAILS FOR METADATA ANNOTATION PROCESS
For the skill set annotation of ORACLE LM, we observed that the ORACLE LM has position bias
when selecting the top-3 necessary skills from preliminary experiments. Therefore, we randomly
shuffle the index of each skill description for each instance. We specify the domain categorization
of FLASK in Table 6, which is divided into 10 domains and 38 sub-domains in total, as mentioned
in Section 3.2. We modify the domain categorization of Wikipedia (Reid et al., 2022) such as

adding the Coding domain into a separate domain considering the significance of the Coding domain
for LLMs (Li et al., 2023a; Luo et al., 2023). Note that the full list of 10 domains and 38 sub-
domains are provided to ORACLE-LM for model-based evaluation and human labelers for human-
based evaluation. For difficulty, since the concept of difficulty is inherently subjective depending
on the annotator’s background and education level, we define the difficulty as how much domain
knowledge is needed. We write descriptions and example instances for each level to clarify the
boundaries between each level. Similar to the evaluation prompt of Chiang et al. (2023), we write
separate guidelines and examples for Math (Figure 44) and Coding (Figure 45) domains, since these
domains have distinct required domain knowledge compared to other domains (Figure 43).
D
METADATA STATISTICS OF EVALUATION SET OF FLASK
We provide detailed statistics of the evaluation set of FLASK. We first provide the proportion of each
primary ability and skill of the evaluation set, shown in Figure 22 and Figure 23. Among different
skills, Comprehension skill accounts for the largest ratio since most instruction requires understand-
ing the purpose of the instruction and fulfilling the requirements accordingly. On the other hand,
Harmlessness and Metacognition skills account for the least. The proportion of each domain of the
evaluation set is shown in Figure 24. While Humanities and Culture domains account for the largest
portion, domains such as History account for the smallest portion. Lastly, we report the statistics
of each difficulty level of the evaluation set in Table 7. The difficulty of formal education knowl-
edge and major-level knowledge (Levels 3 and 4) accounts for the largest ratio while expert-level
knowledge (Level 5) accounts for the least ratio.

HUMAN EVALUATION SETTING
E.1
HUMAN EVALUATION SETTING DETAILS
We recruit 10 labelers from KAIST who are either graduate students or undergraduate students
expecting to graduate within a year and evaluate 200 instances sampled from the evaluation dataset
of FLASK. We communicated with labelers through a separate Slack channel and we held a 1-hour
tutorial session to introduce the purpose of the task and the annotation process. A single instance
is labeled by 3 labelers, which means that every labeler annotates 60 instances. For each instance,
evaluators are provided the question (instruction), the reference answer, and the list of responses of 4
models (GPT-3.5, BARD, VICUNA, ALPACA) while the model name is hidden. The evaluation stage
is divided into 3 parts: 1) binary domain acceptance, 2) scoring and acceptance for each skill, and 3)
difficulty scoring. First, binary domain acceptance is a task to judge whether the domain annotation
annotated by ORACLE LM (GPT-4) is acceptable. Second, evaluators annotate whether the skill is

well annotated and give a score for each skill ranging from 1 to 5 based on the predefined scoring
criteria. For skill acceptance, we make a score of ‘N/A‘ for evaluation of the model response for
each skill, which is assigned when the skill annotated by the ORACLE LM is not needed or irrelevant
to answering the instruction. For difficulty, labelers annotate the difficulty level that ranges from 1 to
5, where Level 1 corresponds to simple lifestyle knowledge and Level 5 corresponds to expert-level
knowledge. The user interface of the human labeling process is shown in Figure 25 and Figure 26.
E.2
RELIABILITY OF AUTOMATIC METADATA ANNOTATION BY GPT-4
Through the process of human evaluation explained in Appendix E.1, we measure the reliability
of automatic metadata annotation. For domain annotation, the acceptance rate is 81.32% while the
acceptance rate for skill annotation is 95.22%. Lastly, for the correlation between human label-
ers and annotation model (GPT-4) of difficulty level annotation, the Spearman, Kendall-Tau, and
Pearson correlation is 0.779, 0.653, and 0.774 respectively, indicating a moderate correlation. Also,

COST AND TIME COMPARISON BETWEEN MODEL-BASED AND HUMAN-BASED
EVALUATION
We compare the cost and time between model-based and human-based evaluation shown in Table
8. Overall, model-based evaluation is 22 times cheaper and 129 times faster than human-based
evaluation, indicating that model-based evaluation could be an efficient way to evaluate LLMs.
However, note that we recommend both evaluation settings are needed for reliable evaluation due to
the respective limitations of each setting, discussed in Section 5.2.

SKILL CATEGORIZATION OF FLASK
We illustrate the skill categorization of FLASK in Table 11. We specify the definition and the
application for each skill. Note that the same definition is provided to both ORACLE LM for model-
based evaluation and human labelers for human-based evaluation.

Preprint
PRIMARY
ABILITY
SKILL
DEFINITION
APPLICATION
Logical
Thinking
Logical
Correctness
Does the model ensure general applicabil-
ity and avoid logical contradictions in its
reasoning steps for an instruction that re-
quires step-by-step logical process? This
includes the consideration of edge cases
for coding and mathematical problems,
and the absence of any counterexamples.
When asked to explain how to bake
a cake, a logically robust response
should include consistent steps in the
correct order without any contradic-
tions.
Logical
Robustness
Is the final answer provided by the re-
sponse logically accurate and correct for an
instruction that has a deterministic answer?
When asked what the sum of 2 and 3
is, the logically correct answer would
be 5.
Logical
Efficiency
Is the response logically efficient?
The
logic behind the response should have no
redundant step, remaining simple and effi-
cient. For tasks involving coding, the pro-
posed solution should also consider time
complexity.
If asked to sort a list of numbers, a
model should provide a concise, step-
by-step explanation without restating
the obvious or using an overly complex
algorithm.
Background
Knowledge
Factuality
Did the model extract pertinent and ac-
curate background knowledge without any
misinformation when factual knowledge
retrieval is needed? Is the response sup-
ported by reliable evidence or citation of
the source of its information?
When asked about the boiling point of
water at sea level, a factually correct
response would be 100 degrees Celsius
(212 Fahrenheit)
Commonsense
Understanding
Is the model accurately interpreting world
concepts for instructions that require a sim-
ulation of the expected result or necessitate
commonsense or spatial reasoning?
The model should know that ice melts
when exposed to heat, even if it is not
explicitly mentioned.
Problem
Handling
Comprehension
Does the response fulfill the requirements
of the instruction by providing relevant in-
formation especially when the instruction
is complex and includes multiple require-
ments? This includes responding in accor-
dance with the explicit and implicit pur-
pose of given instruction.
If asked to evaluate the pros and cons
of a particular policy, a model demon-
strating strong Comprehension would
discuss the potential benefits and draw-
backs of the policy.
Insightfulness
Is the response creative, original or novel,
including new perspectives or interpreta-
tions of existing information?
When discussing potential trends in
fashion, an insightful response could
suggest a unique style or combination
based on past trends and current pref-
erences.
Completeness
Does the response provide a sufficient ex-
planation? Comprehensiveness and thor-
oughness of the response should be con-
sidered, which depends on the breadth of
topics covered and the level of detail pro-
vided within each topic.
When asked to describe how photo-
synthesis works, a complete response
should explain the process, including
the roles of sunlight, water, and carbon
dioxide in producing glucose and oxy-
gen.
Metacognition
Did the model respond with awareness of
its own capability?
Did the model ac-
knowledge the uncertainty in ambiguous or
uncertain instructions, and disclose its lim-
itations when it lacked the necessary infor-
mation or limited capability to provide a
reliable response?
If asked a question beyond their
knowledge, a metacognitively-aware
model might respond, ”I am unsure
of the answer, but I could suggest re-
sources for further research.”
User
Alignment
Readability
Is the response structured to promote read-
ability and coherence? Does the response
exhibit excellent organization?
When asked to explain a complex
topic, a readable response would in-
clude logical explanations, appropriate
paragraph breaks, and a coherent flow
of ideas.
Conciseness
Is the response presented in a concise man-
ner for the reader without any unnecessary
information?
When asked to define a term, a concise
response would provide a clear, brief
definition without including unrelated
details.
Harmlessness
Does the model’s response refrain from bi-
ases tied to gender, race, ethnicity, or re-
ligion? Moreover, does it consider poten-
tial risks to user safety, avoiding provision
of responses that could potentially result in
physical harm or endangerment?
When discussing controversial topics,
a harmless response would be neutral,
evidence-based, and sensitive to di-
verse perspectives.

SOURCE DATASET LIST
We provide the full list of the source datasets that composes the evaluation set of FLASK shown in
Figure 12, which is collected by authors. We include not only datasets that are conventionally used
for the evaluation of LLMs such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022),
but also datasets sourced from diverse domains such as FinQA (Chen et al., 2022) which evaluates
the numerical reasoning over financial data and Haiku Generation dataset (Scialom et al., 2022).
During dataset collection, for instances that have missing outputs (reference answers), we collect
the reference answers using the responses of the ORACLE LM. From preliminary experiments, we
observed that ORACLE LM only references the reference answer instead of fully relying on it during
evaluation. The evaluation set of FLASK is collected from 120 NLP datasets, resulting in 1,700
instances in total. We also provide the full list of the source datasets composing the FLASK-HARD
set, shown in Table 13.

We would like you to label the difficulty of the following question. You should classify
the knowledge needed to solve the question into simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced
lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major level knowledge, and expert level
knowledge. You must write only one class without any explanation.
Simple lifestyle knowledge: Questions that are straightforward and do not require explana-
tions. People without formal education could easily answer these questions.
Example: A second-year college student is usually called a what?
Advanced lifestyle knowledge: Questions that do not require formal education or domain-
specific knowledge but require explaining a well-known concept.
Example: Who was president of the United States when Bill Clinton was born?
Formal education knowledge: Questions that require an understanding of background
knowledge related to the domain. However, they do not require major-level knowledge
related to the domain.
Example: When the Founders met in 1787 to write the Constitution, what was their primary
objective?
Major level knowledge: Questions that require understanding domain-specific concepts and
coming up with novel answers that are creative and sound. People majoring in the domain
can solve these questions.
Example: According to Kubler-Ross, when a terminally ill patient is informed of his/her
condition, what would the patient’s initial reaction likely be?
Expert level knowledge: Questions that require understanding uncommon or professional
domain-specific knowledge and coming up with novel answers that are creative and sound.
A profession in a specific field of the target domain is required.
Example: A company owned a night club that was built on a pier extending into a major
riverbed. For several months sections of the building had been wobbling noticeably, par-
ticularly during inclement weather, when the river pounded more aggressively against the
structure. Several employees and customers complained but the general manager did not
respond. One windy night a section of the pier collapsed into the river, killing 28 customers
and employees. It was revealed that officials had on several prior occasions cited the club for
violating applicable safety regulations. The police arrested the general manager and charged
him with involuntary manslaughter. He defended on the basis that his omissions to act were
legally insufficient to establish manslaughter. What will the court decide?

Preprint
We would like you to label the difficulty of the following question. You should classify
the knowledge needed to solve the question into simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced
lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major level knowledge, and expert level
knowledge. You must write only one class without any explanation.
Simple lifestyle knowledge: Problems that require only simple calculations and only a few
straightforward steps are needed to solve the problem.
Example: Find the value of 4 / 2 * 2 + 8 - 4.
Advanced lifestyle knowledge: Problems that require comprehension of the situation, and
a few step-by-step reasoning procedures and calculations to solve the problem.
These
problems could be solved with general lifestyle knowledge.
Example: Sam and Jeff had a skipping competition at recess. The competition was split into
four rounds. Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff in the first round. Jeff skipped 3 fewer
times than Sam in the second round. Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam in the third round.
Jeff got tired and only completed half the number of skips as Sam in the last round. If Sam
skipped 16 times in each round, what is the average number of skips per round completed
by Jeff?
Formal education knowledge: Problems that require formal education to solve the problem,
and a few step-by-step reasoning procedures and calculations. However, they do not require
major-level knowledge related to the domain.
Example: Suppose that a, b, and c are positive integers satisfying (a+b+c)3−a3−b3−c3 =
150. Find a + b + c.
Major level knowledge: Problems that require domain-specific knowledge such as theorems
or recent research and require complex reasoning steps and calculations.
Example: How many values of x with 0circlex < 990circ satisfy
sinx = −0.31?
Expert level knowledge: Math problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge
to prove theorems or recent research and handle multiple edge cases. These problems require
professional expertise.
Example: Prove that if f is a continuous nonvanishing function on the circle with absolutely
convergent Fourier series, then so is 1/f.

Preprint
We would like you to label the difficulty of the following question. You should classify
the knowledge needed to solve the question into simple lifestyle knowledge, advanced
lifestyle knowledge, formal education knowledge, major level knowledge, and expert level
knowledge. You must write only one class without any explanation.
Simple lifestyle knowledge:
Problems that ask for straightforward implementation or
execution results of the given code. These problems do not require a reasoning step and
could be solved with minimal background knowledge.
Example: Your task is to write code which prints Hello World.
Advanced lifestyle knowledge: Problems that require simple implementation or execution
results of the given code. These problems only require a few reasoning steps to solve them.
Example: Swap given two numbers and print them and return it.
Formal education knowledge: Problems that require some background knowledge such
as well-known algorithms and a few step-by-step reasoning steps. However, they do not
require major-level knowledge related to the domain.
Example: Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing
order.
Major level knowledge: Problems that require domain-specific knowledge such as major-
level algorithms or concepts and require complex reasoning steps to implement or expect
the execution result of the code. Also, these problems require handling multiple edge cases.
Example: Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the
product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not
both pick a character at the same index. Return the maximum possible product of the
lengths of the two palindromic subsequences. A subsequence is a string that can be derived
from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the
remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
Expert level knowledge: Problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge to un-
derstand the problem and implement the code. Also, it is expected to be difficult to handle
all edge cases and implement with optimal time complexity for these problems. These prob-
lems require professional expertise.
Example: You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the longest subse-
quence of nums that meets the following requirements: The subsequence is strictly increas-
ing and the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k. Return the
length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements. A subsequence is an array
that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing
the order of the remaining elements.
