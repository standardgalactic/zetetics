Abstract
This paper discusses ensembles of simple but het-
erogeneous classiﬁers for word-sense disambigua-
tion, examining the Stanford-CS224N system en-
tered in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample
task.
First-order classiﬁers are combined by a
second-order classiﬁer, which variously uses ma-
jority voting, weighted voting, or a maximum en-
tropy model. While individual ﬁrst-order classiﬁers
perform comparably to middle-scoring teams’ sys-
tems, the combination achieves high performance.
We discuss trade-offs and empirical performance.
Finally, we present an analysis of the combination,
examining how ensemble performance depends on
error independence and task difﬁculty.

Introduction
The problem of supervised word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) has been approached using many differ-
ent classiﬁcation algorithms, including naive-Bayes,
decision trees, decision lists, and memory-based
learners. While it is unquestionable that certain al-
gorithms are better suited to the WSD problem than
others (for a comparison, see Mooney (1996)), it
seems that, given similar input features, various al-
gorithms exhibit roughly similar accuracies.1 This
was supported by the SENSEVAL-2 results, where a
This paper is based on work supported in part by the Na-
tional Science Foundation under Grants IIS-0085896 and IIS-
9982226, by an NSF Graduate Fellowship, and by the Research

tories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and CSLI,

mentations of a single classiﬁer type, such as smoothing or win-
dow size, impacted accuracy far more than the choice of classi-
ﬁcation algorithm.
large fraction of systems had scores clustered in a
fairly narrow region (Senseval-2, 2001).
We began building our system with 23 supervised
WSD systems, each submitted by a student taking
the natural language processing course (CS224N) at
Stanford University in Spring 2000. Students were
free to implement whatever WSD method they chose.
While most implemented variants of naive-Bayes,
others implemented a range of other methods, in-
cluding n-gram models, vector space models, and
memory-based learners. Taken individually, the best
of these systems would have turned in an accuracy
of 61.2% in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sam-
ple task (which would have given it 6th place), while
others would have produced middling to low perfor-
mance. In this paper, we investigate how these clas-
siﬁers behave in combination.
In section 2, we discuss the ﬁrst-order classiﬁers
and describe our methods of combination. In sec-
tion 3, we discuss performance, analyzing what ben-
eﬁt was found from combination, and when. We also
discuss aspects of the component systems which
substantially inﬂuenced overall performance.

The System
2.1
Training Procedure
Figure 1 shows the high-level organization of our
system. Individual ﬁrst-order classiﬁers each map
lists of context word tokens to word-sense predic-
tions, and are self-contained WSD systems. The ﬁrst-
order classiﬁers are combined in a variety of ways
with second-order classiﬁers. Second-order classi-
ﬁers are selectors, taking a list of ﬁrst-order out-

puts and choosing from among them. An outline
of the classiﬁer construction process is given in ta-
ble 1. First, the training data was split into training
and held-out sets for each word. This was done us-
ing 5 random bootstrap splits. Each split allocated
75% of the examples to training and 25% to held-
out testing.2 Held-out data was used both to select
the subsets of ﬁrst-order classiﬁers to be combined,
and to select the combination methods.
For each word and each training split, the 23 ﬁrst-
order classiﬁers were (independently) trained and
tested on held-out data. For each word, the ﬁrst-
order classiﬁers were ranked by their average per-
formance on the held-out data, with the most accu-
rate classiﬁers at the top of the rankings. Ties were
broken by the classiﬁers’ (weighted) average perfo-
mance across all words.
For each word, we then constructed a set of can-
2Bootstrap splits were used rather than standard n-fold
cross-validation for two reasons. First, it allowed us to gen-
erate an arbitrary number of training/held-out pairs while still
leaving substantial held-out data set sizes.
Second, this ap-
proach is commonly used in the literature on ensembles. Its
well-foundedness and theoretical properties are discussed in
Breiman (1996). In retrospect, since we did not take proper ad-
vantage of the ability to generate numerous splits, it might have
been just as well to use cross-validation.
didate second-order classiﬁers. Second-order clas-
siﬁer types were identiﬁed by an ensemble size k
and a combination method m. One instance of each
second-order type was constructed for each word.
We originally considered ensemble sizes k in the
range {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}. For a second-order
classiﬁer with ensemble size k, the ensemble mem-
bers were the top k ﬁrst-order classiﬁers according
to the local rank described above.
We combined ﬁrst-order ensembles using one of
three methods m:
• Majority voting: The sense output by the most
ﬁrst-order classiﬁers in the ensemble was chosen.
Ties were broken by sense frequency, in favor of
more frequent senses.
• Weighted voting: Each ﬁrst-order classiﬁer was
assigned a voting weight (see below). The sense
receiving the greatest total weighted vote was
chosen.
• Maximum entropy: A maximum entropy classiﬁer
was trained (see below) and run on the outputs of
the ﬁrst-order classiﬁers.
We considered all pairs of k and m, and so for
each word there were 24 possible second-order clas-
siﬁers, though for k = 1 all three values of m are
equivalent and were merged. The k = 1 ensemble,
as well as the larger ensembles (k ∈{9, 11, 13, 15}),
did not help performance once we had good ﬁrst-
order classiﬁer rankings (see section 3.4).
For m = Majority, there are no parameters to set.
For the other two methods, we set the parameters of
the (k, m) second-order classiﬁer for a word w using
the bootstrap splits of the training data for w.
In the same manner as for the ﬁrst-order classi-
ﬁers, we then ranked the second-order classiﬁers.
For each word, there was the local ranking of the
second-order classiﬁers, given by their (average) ac-
curacy on held-out data. Ties in these rankings were
broken by the average performance of the classiﬁer
type across all words. The top second-order classi-
ﬁer for each word was selected from these tie-broken
rankings.
At this point, all ﬁrst-order ensemble members
and chosen second-order combination methods were
retrained on the unsplit training data and run on the
ﬁnal test data.

It is important to stress that each target word was
considered an entirely separate task, and different
ﬁrst- and second-order choices could be, and were,
made for each word (see the discussion of table 2
below). Aggregate performance across words was
only used for tie-breaking.
2.2
Combination Methods
Our second-order classiﬁers take training instances
of the form ¯s = (s, s1, . . . , sk) where s is the correct
sense and each si is the sense chosen by classiﬁer i.
All three of the combination schemes which we used
can be seen as weighted voting, with different ways
of estimating the voting weights λi of the ﬁrst-order
voters. In the simplest case, majority voting, we skip
any attempt at statistical estimation and simply set
each λi to be 1/k.
For the method we actually call “weighted vot-
ing,” we view the combination output as a mixture
model in which each ﬁrst-order system is a mixture
component:
P(s|s1, . . . , sk) =
X
i
λi P(s|si)
The conditional probabilties P(s|si) assign mass
one to the sense si chosen by classiﬁer i. The mix-
ture weights λi were estimated using EM to max-
imize the likelihood of the second-order training
instances.
In testing, the sense with the highest
weighted vote, and hence highest posterior likeli-
hood, is the selected sense.
For the maximum entropy classiﬁer, we have a
different model for the chosen sense s. In this case,
it is an exponential model of the form:
P(s|s1, . . . , sk) =
exp P
x λx fx(s, s1, . . . , sk)
P
t exp P
x λx fx(t, s1, . . . , sk)
The features fx are functions which are true over
some subset of vectors ¯s. The original intent was to
design features to recognize and exploit “sense ex-
pertise” in the individual classiﬁers. For example,
one classiﬁer might be trustworthy when reporting
a certain sense but less so for other senses. How-
ever, there was not enough data to accurately esti-
mate parameters for such models.3 In fact, we no-

(classiﬁer, chosen sense, correct sense) triple. However, most
senses are rarely chosen and rarely correct, so most features
had zero or singleton support.
ticed that, for certain words, simple majority voting
performed better than the maximum entropy model.
It also turned out that the most complex features we
could get value from were features of the form:
fi(s, s1, . . . , sk) = 1 ⇐⇒s = si
That is, for each ﬁrst-order classiﬁer, there is a sin-
gle feature which is true exactly when that classi-
ﬁer is correct. With only these features, the maxi-
mum entropy approach also reduces to a weighted
vote; the s which maximizes the posterior probabil-
ity P(s|s1, . . . , sk) also maximizes the vote:
v(s) = P
i λiδ(si = s)
The indicators δ are true for exactly one sense, and
correspond to the simple fi deﬁned above.4
The
sense with the largest vote v(s) will be the sense
with the highest posterior probability P(s|s1, . . . sk)
and will be chosen.
For the maximum entropy classiﬁer, we estimate
the weights by maximizing the likelihood of a held-
out set, using the standard IIS algorithm (Berger et
al., 1996). For both weighted schemes, we found
that stopping the iterative procedures before conver-
gence gave better results. IIS was halted after 50
rounds, while EM was halted after a single round.
Both methods were initialized to uniform starting
weights.
More importantly than changing the exact weight
estimates, moving from method to method triggers
broad qualitative changes in what kind of weights
are allowed.
With majority voting, classiﬁers all
have equal, positive weights. With weighted vot-
ing, the weights are no longer required to be equal,
but are still non-negative. With maximum entropy
weighting, this non-negativity constraint is also re-
laxed, allowing classiﬁers’ votes to actually reduce
the score for the sense that classiﬁer has chosen.
Negative weights are in fact assigned quite fre-
quently, and often seem to have the effect of using
poor classiﬁers as “error masks” to cancel out com-
mon errors.
As we move from majority voting to weighted
voting to maximum entropy, the estimation becomes

more sophisticated, but also more prone to overﬁt-
ting. Since solving the overﬁtting problem is hard,
while choosing between classiﬁers based on held-
out data is relatively easy, this spectrum gives us a
way to gracefully handle the range of sparsities in
the training corpora for different words.
2.3
Individual Classiﬁers
While our ﬁrst-order classiﬁers implemented a va-
riety of classiﬁcation algorithms, the differences in
their individual accuracies did not primarily stem
from the algorithm chosen. Rather, implementation
details led to the largest differences. For example,
naive-Bayes classiﬁers which chose sensible win-
dow sizes, or dynamically chose between window
sizes, tended to outperform those which chose poor
sizes. Generally, the optimal windows were either
of size one (for words with strong local syntactic or
collocational cues) or of very large size (which de-
tected more topical cues). Programs with hard-wired
window sizes of, say, 5, performed poorly.
Iron-
ically, such middle-size windows were commonly
chosen by students, but rarely useful; either extreme
was a better design.5
Another implementation choice dramatically af-
fecting performance of naive-Bayes systems was the
amount and type of smoothing. Heavy smoothing
and smoothing which backed off conditional dis-
tributions P(w j|si) to the relevant marginal P(w j)
gave good results, while insufﬁcient smoothing or
backing off to uniform marginals gave substantially
degraded results.6
There is one signiﬁcant way in which our ﬁrst-
order classiﬁers were likely different from other
teams’ systems. In the original class project, stu-
dents were guaranteed that the ambiguous word
would appear only in a single orthographic form,
and many of the systems depended on the input sat-
isfying this guarantee. Since this was not true of
the SENSEVAL-2 data, we mapped the ambiguous
5Such window sizes were also apparently chosen by other
SENSEVAL-2 systems, which commonly used “long distance”
and “local” features, but deﬁned local as a window size of 3–5
words on each side of the ambiguous word.
6In particular, there is a defective behavior with naive-Bayes
where, when one smooths far too little, the chosen sense is the
one which has occurred with the most words in the context
window. For small training sets of skewed-prior data like the
SENSEVAL-2 sets, this is invariably the common sense, regard-
less of the context words.
words (but not context words) to a citation form.
We suspect that this lost quite a bit of information
and negatively affected the system’s overall perfor-
mance, since there is considerable correlation be-
tween form and sense, especially for verbs. Nev-
ertheless, we have made no attempt to re-engineer
the student systems, and have not thoroughly inves-
tigated how big a difference this stemming made.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Results
Table 2 shows the results per word, and table 3
shows results by part-of-speech and overall, for the
SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task. It also
shows what second-order classiﬁers were selected
for each word. 54.2% of the time, we made an opti-
mal second-order classiﬁer choice. When we chose
wrong, we usually made a mistake in either ensem-
ble size or method, rarely both. A wide range of
second-order classiﬁer types were chosen.
As an
overview of the beneﬁt of combination, the globally
best single classiﬁer scored 61.2%, the locally best
single classiﬁer (best on test data) scored 62.2%, the
globally best second order classiﬁer (ME-7, best on
test data) scored 63.2%, and our dynamic selection
method scored 63.9%. Section 3.3 examines combi-
nation effectiveness more closely.
3.2
Changes from SENSEVAL-2
The
system
we
originally
submitted
to
the
SENSEVAL-2 competition had an overall accu-
racy of 61.7%, putting it in 4th place in the revised
rankings (among 21 supervised and 28 total sys-
tems).
Assuming that our ﬁrst-order classiﬁers
were ﬁxed black-boxes, we wanted an idea of how
good our combination and selection methods were.
To isolate the effectiveness of our second-order
classiﬁer choices, we compared our system to an
oracle method (OR-BEST) which chose a word’s
second-order classiﬁer based on test data (rather
than held-out data).
The overall accuracy of this
oracle method was 65.4% at the time, a jump of
3.7%.7 This gap was larger than the gap between
the various top-scoring teams’ systems. Therefore,
while the test-set performance of the second-order
classiﬁers is obviously not available, it was clear
7With other changes, OR-BEST rose to 66.1%.

Figure 2: Accuracy of the various combination methods as
the ensemble size varies. The three combination methods are
shown. In addition, the globally best single classiﬁer is the sin-
gle ﬁrst-order classiﬁer with the highest overall accuracy on the
test data. Chosen combination is our ﬁnal system’s score. These
two are both independent of k in this graph.
ﬁnal accuracy is thus higher than the ﬁrst draft of
the system, and, in particular, the classiﬁer selection
gap between actual performance and the OR-BEST
oracle has been substantially decreased.
In addition, since the top ﬁrst-order classiﬁers
were more reliably identiﬁed, larger ensembles were
no longer beneﬁcial in the revised system, for an in-
teresting reason. When the ﬁrst-order rankings were
poorly estimated, large ensembles and weighted
methods were important for achieving good accu-
racy, because the weighting scheme could “rescue”
good classiﬁers which had been incorrectly ranked
low. In our current system, however, ﬁrst-order clas-
siﬁers were ranked reliably enough that we could re-
strict our ensemble sizes to k ∈{1, 3, 5, 7}. Further-
more, since k = 1 was only chosen a few times,
usually among ties, we removed that option as well.
3.3
Combination Methods and Ensemble Size
Our system differs from the typical ensemble of
classiﬁers in that the ﬁrst-order classiﬁers are not
merely perturbations of each other, but are highly
varied in both quality and character. This scenario
has been investigated before, e.g.
(Zhang et al.,
1992), but is not the common case. With such het-
erogeneity, having more classiﬁers is not always bet-
ter. Figure 2 shows how the three combination meth-
ods’ average scores varied with the number of com-

ponent classiﬁers used. Initially, accuracy increases
as added classiﬁers bring value to the ensemble.
However, as lower-quality classiﬁers are added in,
the better classiﬁers are steadily drowned out. The
weighted vote and maximum entropy combinations
are much less affected by low-quality classiﬁers than
the majority vote, being able to suppress them with
low weights. Still, majority vote over small ensem-
bles was effective for some words where weights
could not be usefully set by the other methods.
3.4
Ranking Methods
Because of the effects described above, it was nec-
essary to identify which classiﬁers were worth in-
cluding for a given word. A global ranking of ﬁrst-
order classiﬁers, averaged over all words, was not
effective because the strengths of the classiﬁers were
so different. In fact, every single ﬁrst-order clas-
siﬁer was a top-5 performer on at least one word.
On the other hand, SENSEVAL-2 training sets were
often very small, and very skewed towards a fre-
quent most-frequent-sense. As a result, accuracy es-
timates based on single words’ held-out data pro-
duced frequent ties. The average size of the per-
word largest set of tied ﬁrst-order classiﬁers was
3.6 (with a maximum of 23 on the word collabo-
rate where all tied). The second-order local rank-
ings also produced many ties. For the top position
(the most important for second-order ranks) 43.1%
of the words had local ties.
In our submitted entry, all ties were broken unin-
telligently (in an arbitrary manner based on the order
in which systems were listed in a ﬁle). The approach
of local ranking with global tie-breaking presented
in this paper was much more successful accord-
ing to two distinct measures. First, it predicted the
true ranks more accurately, (measured by the Spear-
man rank correlation: 0.08 for global ranks, 0.63
for globally-broken local ranks) and gave better ﬁ-
nal accuracy scores (63.5% with global, 63.9% with
globally-broken local – signiﬁcant only at p=0.1 by
a sign test at the word type level).
The other ranking that our system attempts to es-
timate is the per-word ranking of the second-order
classiﬁers.
In this case, however, we are only
ever concerned with which classiﬁer ends up be-
ing ranked ﬁrst, as only that classiﬁer is chosen.
Again, globally-broken local ranks were the most
effective, choosing a second-order classiﬁer which
was actually top-performing on test data for 54% of
the words, as opposed to 50% for global selection
(and increasing the overall accuracy from 62.8% to
63.9% – signiﬁcant at p=0.01, sign test).
These results stress that ranking, and effective tie-
breaking, are important for a system such as ours
where the classiﬁers are so divergent in behavior.
3.5
Combination
When combining classiﬁers, one would like to know
when and how the combination will outperform the
individuals. One factor (Tumer and Ghosh, 1996)
is how complementary the mistakes of the individ-
ual classiﬁers are. If all make the same mistakes,
combination can do no good. We can measure this
complementarity by averaging, over all pairs of ﬁrst-
order classiﬁers, the fraction of errors that pair has in
common. This gives average pairwise error indepen-
dence. Another factor is the difﬁculty of the word
being disambiguated. A high most-frequent-sense
baseline (BL-MFS) means that there is little room
for improvement by combining classiﬁers. Figure 3
shows, for the global top 7 ﬁrst-order classiﬁers, the
absolute gain between their average accuracy (BL-
AVG-7) and the accuracy of their majority combina-
tion (MJ-7). The quantity on the x-axis is the dif-
ference between the pairwise independence and the
baseline accuracy. The pattern is loose, but clear.
When either independence increases or the word’s
difﬁculty (as indicated by the BL-MFS baseline) in-
creases, the combination tends to win by a greater
amount.
Figure 4 shows how the average pairwise inde-
pendent error fraction (api) varies as we add classi-
ﬁers. Here classiﬁers are added in an order based on
their accuracy on the entire test set. For each k, the
average is over all pairs of classiﬁers in the top k and
all samples of all words. This graph should be com-
pared to ﬁgure 2. After the third classiﬁer, adding
classiﬁers reduces the api, and the performance of
the majority vote begins to drop at exactly this point.
However, the weighted methods continue to gain in
accuracy since they have the capacity to downweight
classiﬁers which hurt held-out accuracy.
The drop in api reﬂects that the newly added sys-
tems are no longer bringing many new correct an-
swers to the collection. However, they can still add

Conclusions
In this paper, we have explored ensemble sizes, com-
bination methods, bounds for what can be expected
from combinations, factors in the performance of in-
dividual classiﬁers, and methods of improving per-
formance by effective tie-breaking. In accord with
much recent work on classiﬁer combination, e.g.
(Breiman, 1996; Bauer and Kohavi, 1999), we have
demonstrated that the combination of classiﬁers can
lead to a substantial performance increase over the
individual classiﬁers within the domain of WSD. In
addition, we have shown that highly varying com-
ponent systems augment each other well and that
adding lower-scoring systems can still improve en-
semble performance, at least to a certain point. A
particular emphasis of our research has been how to
make the combination robust to both the wide range
of ﬁrst-order classiﬁer accuracies and to the sparsity
of the available training data. Careful but greedy de-
termination of rankings proved to be effective, cap-
turing the highly word-dependent strengths of our
classiﬁers. The resulting system’s overall accuracy
is very high, despite the medium level of accuracy
of the component systems.
