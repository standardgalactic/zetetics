The metastable behavior of the 
two dimensional Ising model

Abstract. We apply the Freidlin-Wentzell theory to analyse the typical evolution of the 
stochastic Ising model in a two dimensional lattice torus. We estimate the logarithmic 
asymptotic of hitting time of the configurations with all spins up or down, starting from an 
arbitrary configuration. Our approach also provides a hierarchic structure of metastable 
states and insight into the critical droplet. 
1. Introduction 
The metastable behavior is a phenomenon observed in some thermodynamic sys-
tems. See [10] and [13] for a detailed description and physical background. It is 
also related to various scientific interests, e.g, the associative memory in neural 
networks, folding of proteins, immune systems, simulated annealing, etc. ([1]). In 
order to have a deeper understanding and rigorous explanations of the metastable 
behavior, there are continuous efforts in recent years, and many models have been 
studied. In particular, the two dimensional stochastic Ising model presents in a 
precise sense the features associated to metastability. Based on elementary meth-
ods and careful analyses, the typical evolution from the configuration that all spins 
are down (—1) to the configuration that all spins are up (+1) is discussed, and the 
so-called critical droplet is identified ([11], [14]). It is also mentioned in [12], [13] 
the difficulties of using the theory of Freidlin-Wentzell ([5]) to derive the results. 
Compared with the pathwise approach to metastability of the dynamical systems 
subject to small random perturbation ([9], [6]), in the stochastic Ising model there 
is a large number of local minima of the potential energy and the limit system 
corresponding to β = oo is not deterministic. 
In this paper we take the pathwise approach in the sense of [5] to study the 
two dimensional stochastic Ising model. The large deviation theory of Freidlin and 
Wentzell is developed for a family of exponentially perturbed Markov chains ([2]). 
The stochastic Ising model parameterized by the inverse temperature β perfectly 
fits in the frame of exponentially perturbed Markov chain. In the light of the gen-
eral theory of [2], the asymptotic behavior of the stochastic Ising model at vanish-

ing temperature is determined by the most possible path between attractors. The 
investigation is thus reduced to finding out the attractors and most possible paths 
between any two of them. We estimate the logarithmic asymptotics of hitting time 
of the configurations with all spins up or down, starting from an arbitrary configu-
ration. Our approach also provides a hierarchic structure of metastable states and 
insight into the critical droplet (Proposition 8). By the hierarchic structure we see 
more clearly the evolution between metastable states and the set of configurations 
that are visited many times before the Ising model reaches -f.1. We show that be-
sides + 1 and —1 the metastable phenomena also occur in the neighborhood of all 
the configurations attaining local minima of the potential. Our results are related 
to Problem 2, page 597 of [13]. 
In fact, this approach gives a uniform treatment for metastability problem. 
We investigate the same problem of the three dimensional stochastic Ising model 
and report our findings in [3]. It is apparent that all conclusions still hold for the 
continuous time stochastic Ising model. We do need the concreteness of a dynamics 
in order to verify some facts, for example, (11). But the method is insensitive to 
the choice of dynamics and many examples of [12] can be dealt with similarly. 
The present paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the model 
and give a precise description of the metastable behavior in Theorems 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
Section 3 recalls the main results of [2] and puts our problem into the framework 
of exponentially perturbed Markov chains. Section 4 investigates the minimum 
barrier from —1 to +1. A hierarchic structure of attractors is analysed in detail in 
Section 5. The proof of the theorems are carried out in the last section. The paper 
ends with an additional statement on the metastable behavior (Theorem 12). 
2. Typical growth and shrink of droplets 
Let A be the two dimensional lattice torus, namely {1,... , Ν} χ {1,... , Ν} with 
periodic boundary condition. Associate to each site χ e A either a +1 spin or a 
—1 spin, denoted by R?(x). The collection { Τ / ( Χ ) } Χ € Λ IS called a configuration and 
denoted by η. Specially, +1 is the configuration with all spins up (η(χ) — +1 for 
all χ G A), and —I is the configuration with all spins down (η(χ) = —1 for all 
χ € A). Let S be the set of all configuration r/'s, i.e, 
S = { - 1,+1}Λ. 
For each configuration η e S assign the Hamiltonian

where the first sum runs over the pairs of neighboring sites of A, counting < x, y > 
and < y,x

The first sum is the number of pairs of neighboring sites with opposite spins. The 
second sum is the number of +1 spins. 
The discrete time stochastic

We denote the stochastic Ising model exclusively by { X n } . In physics, the parame-
ter β is interpreted as the inverse temperature and h as the strength of the external 
field. We shall only study the most interesting case which satisfies the following 
assumption. The other cases are not difficult, as explained in [11]. 
Basic Assumption. 0 < h < 2, 2 j h is not an integer, and Ν > 4(1 + 2 / h ) 2 . 
Define 
L2 = [2/h] +1, 
r2 = 4L2-h(L2-L2 
+ l), 
(4) 
where [ · ] is the integral part of a number. As usual, the first hitting time 
σ(Α) 
and the first exit time r(A) of a subset A C S are defined respectively as 
σ(Α) = inf{n | Xn e Α}, 
τ(Α) = inf{n | Xn <£ A}. 
(5) 
If A consists of a single configuration, say A — {ξ}, we write simply σ(ξ) instead 
ofa({£})· 
Theorem 1. 
(i) 
lim^oc P-i(\jj loga(+l) - Γ 2 | < e) = 1; 
(ii) lim^oo i^i(I J l o g a ( - l ) - (Γ2 + hN2)\ < e) = 1; 
lim^oo i l o g E ^ - l ) = Γ 2 + hN2. 
Throughout this paper we shall identify ξ Ε S with the subset { ϊ € Λ | ξ(χ) = 
+1} of Λ. We say ξ > η if {χ G Λ | ξ(ζ) = +1} D {χ e Λ | η(χ) = +1}. A 
connected component of {x € Λ | ξ(χ) = +1} is called a cluster. A rectangle l\ χ l2 
means a rectanglar cluster of +1 spins surrounded by —1 spins. Let us agree that

We say that rectangles are separated if the distance between them is larger than 2. 
Let 
ΊΖ = {ξ e S I {x 6 A I ξ(χ) = + 1 } consists of separated rectangles}.

We say that configuration ξ is subcritical (supercritical) 
if 
lim P f (σ(-1) < σ(+1)) = 1 
(0 respectively).

Theorem 2. Assume ξ e ΤΙ, ξ φ +1, - 1 , e > 0. 
(i) 
i/L(£) < L2, then ξ is subcritical 
and 
l i m ^ « i f (I J l o g a ( - l ) - ( m - l)/i| < e) = 1, 
lim^oo i log Εξσ(-Ι)

and 
lim^oo i f (|± loga(+l) - (2 - h)\ < e) = 1, 
lim^^oo ^ logJ5fff(+l) = 2 - h . 
Theorem 2 tells that a rectangle l\ χ fa is supercritical (subcritical) if Ιι Λ fa 
> L2 (< L2). { X n } starting from ξ will visit + 1 first if ξ contains a supercritical 
rectangle, or simply, L(£) > L2. If ζ contains no supercritical rectangles, then 
{ X n } starting from ζ hits —1 first. Furthermore, once hitting +1, { X n } will stay 
in the set of supercritical configurations for time 
1), which is much greater 
than the time 
it spends in the set of subcritical configurations. The 
ratio is e^hN2, 
diverging to 00 as β —* oo. Introduce 
C = {ξ I {x 6 Λ|ξ(χ) = + 1 } consists of a L2 x (£2 — 1) rectangle 
and a +1 spin attached to the longer side}, 
£ - {£ I { χ E ΛΙ£( Χ) = + 1 } is a L2 x L2 rectangle}. 
ζ G C is called a critical droplet (see Figure la). 
Theorem 3. 
lim^.»«, Ρ^λ(σ(β) < σ(£) < σ(+1)) = 1. 
Theorem 3 tells that in very low temperature { X n } starting from —I almost 
surely hits a critical droplet, then hits a L2 x L2 rectangle before visiting +1. 
For a configuration ξ Ε TZ, ξ^ 
is obtained from ξ by deleting all its subcritical 
rectangles. Namely,

following five conditions is called typical shrink and growth of droplets, and is

at most L2 - 1, and if ζ Ε ΤΙ, ζ > Χη then ζ > 
Theorem 4. For any e > Ο,ξ Ε 7Ζ, lim^oo P^(D(e)) 
= 1. 
The above theorem asserts that in very low temperature almost all paths are 
typical shrink and growth of droplets. Starting from an arbitrary configuration 
7] 6 5, Xn will quickly get 7Z. In fact, lim/3_»oo \E&a{lZ) = 0. Afterwards the 
evolution is described by Theorems 2 and 4. But Χ σ(η) is not uniquely determined 
by η. For example, if the initial state Xo is a critical droplet, Xn will first visit 
a supercritical L2 x L2 rectangle or a subcritical (L2 - 1) x I 2 rectangle with 
almost equal probability. We need the following definition to describe the general 
situation. 
A sequence {77^, k — 0,1,... , m} is called leading η to ξ if η = ηο, ξ = ητη and 
77j+i = rjj1 for some Xj G Λ, j — 0,1,2,... , m—1. The quantity maxo<j<m 
— 
Η (η) is called the barrier from η to ξ along the sequence {r]j}· 
The minimum 
barrier from η to ξ is the minimum of barriers over all sequences leading η to ξ. A 
sequence leading η to ξ with the minimum barrier is called the most possible path 
from η to ξ. 
For η G S, if ξ £ 1Z and the minimum barrier from η to ξ is 0, then lim 
Ρξ{Χσ(π) 
— ξ) > 0. It is relatively easy to find all such £'s.

Thus the two dimensional stochastic Ising model parameterized by β perfectly fits 
in the general framework of the exponentially perturbed Markov chains discussed 
in [2]. Recall the main results of [2] as follows. For a subset Κ C S, let G{K) be

Metastability of the Ising model 
79 
We will see that level 1 attractors are exactly the metastable states. The set 
Αχ of all level 1 attractors is depicted by the next lemma. Lemma 9 of Section 5 
enables us to avoid attractive basin B ^ s in the discussion. Nevertheless we like to 
point out that the attractive basin of a level 1 attractor ξ is {η | minimum barrier 
from η to ξ is 0}. 
Lemma 5 (Characterization of metastable states). A\ = ΊΖ. 
Proof. To prove 1Z C Αχ, suppose that ξ G TZ. Then Οξ>η > 0 for all η φ ξ by 
direct computation. Hence ρ°°(ξ, η) = 0 for all η φ ξ. So ξ is a level 1 attractor. 
To prove Ai C TZ, assume that ξ G Ai and D is a cluster of +1 spins of ξ. We 
first remark that it is impossible that (21,22), {ζχ + 1,22), (zi,z2 
— 1) G .D, but 
(zi 4- 1,Z2 - 1) 4- D, since Η (ξ) > Η(ξχ), χ = (ζχ + 1,22 - 1) in this case. For 
any χ — (zi, 22) G D, there are always at least two neighbors of χ in D. Without 
loss of generality by symmetry we can assume that (21,22), (21,22 — 1) G D. Then 
there are only two possible cases for ξ G Αχ. 
Case (i). (21 + l,z 2) (or (ζχ - 1 ,z2)) G D. 
Case (ii). ( z i + l , z 2 ) , (21 - 1,z 2) $ D, (Zl,z2 
+ 
l)eD. 
For case (i), let 
h = max{j I (21 + i, 22) G D for all i < j}, 
I2 = max{j I (21 + i, 22 — 1) G D for all i < j}. 
If Ιχ > l2 then (21 + h,z2), 
(21 + l2 + 1,22), (z\ + l2,z2 - 1) G D, and (21 + 
l2 + 1,22 — 1) ^ D. This is impossible because ζ G A\, as we remarked earlier. 
Therefore l\ < l 2 . By the same reason l\ > l 2 . Then l\ = l2. Applying this result 
for each (21,22) G D we have n\, n2, fci, k2 such that 
(zi +i,z2+ 
j) G D, 
Vni < i < n2, ki < j < k2, 
and 
(21 + n2 + 1,22 + j), (21 -n1-l,z2+ 
j) ^ D, 
Vfci < j < k2, 
(21 +i,z2 
+ k2 + 1), (21 + i, z2 - ki - 1) ^ D, 
Vni <i 
<n2. 
Hence D — {(ζχ +i,z2+ 
j) \ ηχ <i< 
n2, kx < j < k2}. 
For case (ii), we apply the above remark repeatedly, and conclude inductively 
that case (i) will never happen anymore for all (21 + i,z2) G D (i > 1) and there 
must be (ζχ + i + 1, z2) G D. Finally we obtain the whole loop {(21 + i, z2) | 1 < 
i < N} = D. 
The separation of rectangles of ξ is also an immediate consequence of the as-
sumption of Η(ξ) being minimum.

4. The minimum barrier 
Lemma 6. The minimum barrier from —1 to +1 is 
and the minimum barrier 
from +1 to -1 is Γ2 + hN2. 
To prove this lemma we partition S according the number of +1 spins, i.e, let 
Proof. It is easy to find configurations having the Hamiltonian given in (18), e.g, a 
square / x 
a rectangle / x (/ + 1) or clusters shown in Figure 1. The hard part is 
to show these numbers are lower bounds. To compute Η (ξ), we only have to count 
the number of pairs of neighboring sites < x, y > with opposite signs because the 
second sum of (2) is k for any ξ € Sk- The less the number of such pairs the lower 
the Hamiltonian. 
Thus the configuration ξ with the lowest Hamiltonian Η (ξ) among Sk must 
have a single cluster of +1 spin. Suppose that there were two clusters of +1 spins. 
Translating one cluster towards the another until the distance between them is 1 
and two clusters are merged into one. The number of +1 spins remains unchanged 
but the number of pairs of neighboring sites with opposite signs is reduced at least 
by 2. Hence we get a configuration of Sk with lower Hamiltonian. 
Since k < N, the single cluster of positive spins contains no loop 1 χ Ν and can 
be enclosed in the smallest rectangle 
χ I2 with +1 spins on each edge (see Figure 
2). Check every lines intersecting with the rectangle h χ I2· Spins are —1 outside 
the rectangle by definition, and +1 in the middle (otherwise the cluster is not 
connected). So somewhere in the line there are at least two pairs of neighboring 
sites with opposite spins. There are l\ +I2 such lines so there are at least 2(ii -f I2) 
pairs. Notice that M2 > k and consequently l\ + I2 > 2m. Since Ii, I2 and m are 
integers, the inequality can be refined as 
Sk = {£ I the number of +1 spins of ξ — fc}. 
We need another lemma for the proof. 
(17) 
(18) 
4m 
if k = m2, 
2(1χ + Z2) > 
4m + 2 
if m2 < k < m2 + m, 
l 4m + 4 
if m2 + m < k < (m + l)2. 
The lower bound follows from Η (ξ) > 2(lx + l2) - kh for all ξ G Sk. 
• 
Define Hk = min^esfc Η (ξ). Equation (18) gives the numerical value of Hk for 
k up to N. Actually it holds for k < N2 fA and provides an upper bound of Hk for 

Metastability of the Ising model 
81 
large k. Another upper bound works better for large k (> N2 /4). 
Hk < 2N + 2 - hk. 
(19) 
In particular we know from (18) and (19) that Hk reaches maximum at kc = 
L2 — L2 + 1 (Figure 3). This gives the critical droplet a new interpretation. 
Proposition 8. η is a critical droplet if and only if Η {η) — maxjt min^e5fc Η (ξ). 
Proof of Lemma 7. First construct a sequence leading —1 to +1. For a configuration 
with all —1 spins except a square l χ I of +1 spins, add a line of +1 spins to one 
side of the square. It turns into a rectangle (I + 1) χ 1. Then add +1 spins to 
the longer side of the rectangle to form a square (Z + 1) χ (I + 1). Repeating this 
procedure until all spins are +1. Along this sequence the potential increases until 
I — L2, reaching the maximum Γ2 at ξ G C, then decreases for I > L2· This implies 
that the minimum barrier from —I to +1 < Γ2. 
On the other hand, suppose that {ξι,... , ξη} is an arbitrary sequence leading 
— 1 to +1. The number of +1 spins can only increase or decrease by one each time 
along the sequence. There must exist 
G Skc for some j. Then 
maχΗ(ξ ί) - H{-1) > Η (ξ,) - 0 > min Η (η) = Γ2.

V€Skc 
This concludes the proof of the first part. The proof of the second statement follows 
from the symmetry of the Markov chain {Xn} and #(+1) = —hN2. 
• 
5. A hierarchic structure of attractors 
The hierarchic structure of attractors and Theorem A give a clear picture that 
how {Xn} evolves from a configuration to attractors in ΑΙ, A2, • · · and eventually 
to AL2 = {+!, —1}- It remains to identify attractors of higher levels. This is not a 
simple task. To get around the problem, we take the advantage of the symmetry 
and the potential function H(·) of the stochastic Ising model. The following lemma 
gives a relation between Vf and minimum barriers. 
Lemma 9 (Lemma 13 [3]). Suppose A* is a level k attractor and ζ Ε A*. Then 
Vjfc = min {minimum barrier from ζ to ζ' \ ζ' € A* for some j φ i}. 
(20) 
This lemma plays a crucial role in the following discussion. It enables us to 
compute V]k without knowing Bf completely (see (14) for comparison). For ζ G A1^ 
we are looking for ζ' e A) satisfying (20). IMf = {£}, we shall write Vk(£) instead 
of V f . For ζ G TZ = Αι, let l(ξ) be the shortest side-length of rectangles of ξ, i.e, 
(

) 
min{/i Λ l2\ h x I2 is a rectangle of ξ, Ζχ, I2 < Ν — 1}

Lemma 10. Suppose that ξ 6 Αι, ξ φ +1, —1. 
(i) 
Ι/1(ξ) < L2> then ^ ( 0 = (1(ξ) - 1 )h. 
(ii) If 1(ξ) > L2, then V 1 ^ ) 
=2-h. 
Proof. There are three possibilities of leading ξ to another level 1 attractor. 
(1) Adding one line of +1 spins to one side of a rectangle of 
The minimum 
barrier to add the first +1 spin to one side of a rectangle of ξ is 2 — h. Afterwards 
adding +1 spins on the line one by another decreases the potential. Let ξ+ be 
the resulting configuration, then the minimum barrier from ξ to 
is 2 — h. If ξ 
contains a k χ Ν (k > 2) which is supercritical, the above equation also holds. 
(2) Removing one line of +1 spins of length li from a rectangle of ξ G A\. 
Let ξ~ be the resulting configuration, then the minimum barrier from ξ to ξ~ is 
(h — 1 )h. If ζ contains a loop 1 χ TV, removing a line leads to elimination of the 
whole loop. The above equation holds formally because we have set 1(ξ) = 2 in 
this case. 
(3) Adding one +1 spin at site (zi, z2) such that surrounding spins are all — 1, 
then turns into a configuration ξ' G Ai. The minimum barrier from ξ to ξ' > 4 — h. 
= (2 - h) Α (1(ξ) - 1 )h by Lemma 9. This implies (i) and (ii). 
• 
It is important to notice that Η(ξ~) or Η(ξ+) < Η (ξ) in the above arguments. 
This, together with Lemma 5, implies that every attractor of any level consists 
of a single configuration. We repeatedly apply (i) or (ii) of Lemma 10 to get a 
most possible path from ξ to —i or +1· The minimun barrier from ζ e 71 to — 1 
is (L(£) — 1 )h if L(£) < L2 — 1. The minimun barrier from ξ Ε TZ to +1 is 2 — h if 
L{0 > L2. We summarize as follows. 
Proposition 11. (i) r = L2 +1. Tk = kh if k < L2 - 2; 
ι = 2 -h,TL2=

6. Proof of the theorems 
Proof of Theorems 1 and 2. Theorem 1 is an immediate consequence of Lemma 
6 and (14) (16) of Theorem A. Theorem 2 follows from Proposition 11 and (14), 
(16) of Theorem A. 
• 
Proof of Theorem 3. In the proof of Lemma 6 we showed that every most possible 
path from —1 to +1 contains a critical droplet. By (15) of Theorem A, 
{Xn} 
moves along the most possible paths with probability converging to 1 as β —• oo. 
So lim^oo Ρ^λ{σ{0) 
< σ(+1)) = 1. For ζ e C, ζχ is the configuration satisfying 
(15), where χ is the site next to the additional +1 spin of the critical droplet with 
two neighboring sites of +1 spins and two neighboring sites of —1 spins (see Figure

lb). Then { X n } almost surely visits ζχ. In turn ζχ is in the attractive basin of 
a L*2 x L2 rectangle 
6 Q. {Xn} 
starting from ζχ will visit C+ by part 5) of 
Theorem A. We thus conclude Theorem 3 by the strong Markovian property. 
• 
Proof of Theorem 4. By Proposition 11, if ξ e Τ1,1(ξ) = k + 1 then ξ e 
Ak 
but ξ £ .Afc+i· (14) asserts that, with probability near 1 as β —• oo, {Xn} 
exits 
the level k attractive basin approximately at time e&kh. Namely, all rectangles 
of ξ with li A 1-2 — k + 1 disappear after time 
Denote this resulting 
attractor as ξ'. By the same reason, all rectangles Ιχ χ I2 of ξ' with the shortest 
side-length /(£') disappear after time e^ 1^ ) - 1) Λ with probability 1 as β —• oo. 
After repeating this argument several times, the configuration has only rectangles 
with side length > ^(ξ) (see (9) for the definition). It is a level ί(ξ) — 1 attractor. It 
takes about 
to exit the corresponding level (ί(ζ) — 1) attractive basin. 
At this moment all subcritical rectangles disappear and ξ turns into 
The time 
needed for all subcritical rectangles to disappear is bounded below and above by 
<(0 
eß(£(0-i)h 
and

k=i(0 
Now for the level (L2 - 1) attractor 
( ί ( ξ ( _ ) ) - 1)Λ > 2 - h if £<-> φ - I . The 
minimum barrier from 
to +1 is 2 — h= Τ^ 2_ι(ξ). Configuration +1 can be 
reached by adding a line of +1 spins to a rectangle of 
several times. The time 
needed to get + 1 is about 2NeV- hW. If 
= —1, the evolution is characterized 
by Theorems 1 and 3 because of the strong Markovian property. 
• 
We conclude this paper with theorems of [2] applied to our problem, as an 
integral part of characterization of the evolution of { X n } . Partial results have 
been obtained before (Theorem 2, [11]). 
Theorem 12 (Theorems 5 and 6, [2]). If {ξ} = 
€ Ak, and Xn starts from η

then the following holds: 
(1) 
The distribution of τη (Bf)/Ετζ

converges to the exponential distribution 
with mean 1 as β —> oo. 
(2) The distribution of

converges to a distribution in Bf as β —> oo. There are at most k possible 
limit distributions for 7 < Vf.
