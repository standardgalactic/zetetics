Electricity, once a scientific curiosity, is a necessity in the modern world of sophisticated equipment and machinery. 
Without electricity, industry as we know it would not exist. Production equipment, communications systems, and 
utilities operate on electricity.  
 
The language of electricity may confuse the layman, but electrical and electronics specialists must know the specific 
meaning of each word and term. In this Lesson, we define electrical terms used by electrical craftsmen. We also describe 
matter, molecules, atoms, and their relationship to electricity.  
 
Electrical force is also explained in this Lesson. We describe how objects attract and repel each other depending on 
their electrical charge. You may want to experiment with forces after studying this Lesson.

History of Electricity 
1-1 
Electricity is one of our most useful sources of energy today. It is hard to imagine how a modern industrial society 
could exist without electricity. But until the mid-1800s, no one knew much about electricity or how to use it. Until 
then, electricity was nothing more than a scientific curiosity. 
1-2 
When scientists first began studying electricity, they discovered that electricity and magnetism are related. For 
example, they discovered that when an electric current flows in a wire, it creates a magnetic field. The magnetic 
field is exactly like the field produced by an ordinary magnet. It produces the same effects on a compass and on 
iron filings. They also discovered that you can make an electric current flow in a wire if you move the wire rapidly 
through a magnetic field. 
 
1-3 
These experiments led to an understanding of electromagnetism which is the relationship between an electric 
current and a magnetic field.  Electromagnetism is the foundation of all our modern electrical machinery and 
equipment. 
 
1-4 
Understanding the relationship between electricity and magnetism has made it possible to invent machines that 
generate large amounts of electricity at low cost.  Electricity from these generators drives countless kinds of 
industrial machinery and provides mass transportation in our cities.  It also provides the power for light, heat, 
communications, and data processing. 
 
Language of Electricity 
 
1.5 
Electrical and electronics craftsmen use special words and phrases just as carpenters and mechanics do. The 
workers in each trade have their own special ways of communicating to other workers in the trade. When 
you use electrical terms, make sure you understand what each term means. 
1-6 
For example, you may hear someone say, "The power output is low." You may think you know what the 
statement means. But the word power has a very special meaning. Low power is not necessarily the same as 
too little electricity. 
1-7 
Almost every electrical machine or appliance has a tag or nameplate stating the operating voltage and 
current of the unit. These terms also have special meanings. You must understand those meanings in order 
to make use of the information they provide. 
1-8 
Electrical voltage is often compared to pressure in a water system. The two ideas are not exactly the same. 
But they are enough alike to make the comparison useful. You may find electricity easier to understand at 
first if you think of voltage as a sort of "electrical pressure" that pushes electric current through a wire or 
through a piece of equipment. 
1-9 
Another common name for voltage is electromotive force, abbreviated emf. This term is used by many people, 
but it is misleading. Electromotive force is not the same as the force of gravity or the force that a tool exerts on a 
workpiece. It refers to the same "electrical pressure" as voltage, and it is measured in volts.

Language of Electricity (continued) 
 
1-10  
Electricity in motion is called current electricity. You can think of electric current as being similar to a current of 
water in a pipe or in a stream. But there are some important differences you must learn about in order to avoid 
confusion. Electric current is measured in amperes, often abbreviated amps. 
1-11  
Electricity that does not move is called static electricity. You probably have had first-hand experience with static 
electricity. If you walk across a carpet when the surrounding air is fairly dry, static electricity may build up on your 
body. If you then touch a door knob, a water faucet, or some other metal object, the static electricity flows into 
the metal. 
1-12  
If you have built up enough static electricity on your body, the electricity may suddenly jump from your hand to 
the metal. It jumps just before you touch the metal. Then you can feel the electricity flowing for an instant. You 
call the feeling a "shock." The shock may startle you, and it may cause a little pain, but it is harmless. 
1-13  
If you connect a wire across the terminals of a dry cell or a storage battery, electric current flows through the wire. 
The flowing electricity raises the temperature of the wire. The wire may become hot enough to glow, or even 
melt. 
1-14  
This effect demonstrates another important idea concerning electricity. Electricity has energy. When it flows, its 
energy decreases, and the energy of something else increases. A wire increases its thermal energy when it gets 
hot. A motor increases its rotational energy when the armature and shaft start spinning. 
Structure of Matter 
1-15  
To understand electricity, you must understand the structure of matter. Electricity is related to some of the most 
basic building blocks of matter— atoms, electrons, and protons. All matter is made of these electrical building 
blocks, and therefore all matter is said to be "electrical." 
1-16  
Matter is defined as anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter is made of tiny, invisible particles called 
molecules. A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance that has the properties of the substance. Each 
molecule can be divided into simpler parts by chemical means. The simplest parts of a molecule are called atoms. 
1-17  
Matter consisting of two or more different kinds of atoms is called a compound. Water, table salt, and 
alcohol are examples of compounds. The smallest particle of a compound is a molecule. Each molecule 
of a compound consists of the same number and kind of atoms, joined chemically into a single unit. 
1-18  
If you separate the atoms of a molecule into smaller groups, or into individual atoms, you no longer have the same 
compound. The simpler molecules or atoms make up a different material having different properties.

Structure of Matter (continued) 
1-19  
For example, a molecule of water is made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, as shown in 
Figure 1.1 below. This molecule is the smallest bit of water that still has the properties of water. If you break 
the atoms apart, you no longer have water. Instead you have two gases, hydrogen and oxygen, with properties 
entirely different from those of water. They have different densities, boiling temperatures, and chemical 
properties. 
1-20  
When all of the atoms in a given piece of matter are of the same kind, the matter is called an element. More 
than 100 different elements are known today. Ninety-two of them are stable and occur in nature. Examples 
include nitrogen and oxygen in the air, carbon in living things, and silicon in sand. 
1-21  
About a dozen elements are unstable. Each atom of such an element exists for only a fraction of a second 
during a nuclear reaction. No one has ever seen material made of one of these elements. 
 
Structure of Atoms 
1-22  
Most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in a tiny spot at the center, called the nucleus. The nucleus is not 
a single particle, however. It is a collection of two kinds of particles called protons and neutrons. The proton 
has a positive electrical charge. The neutron has no electrical charge. It is neutral. 
1-23  
The positive charge of each proton equals the negative charge of each electron. The two opposite charges 
cause a force of attraction between the proton and the electron. The proton pulls inward on the electron, and 
the electron pulls outward on the proton. 
1-24  
If the proton and electron had the same mass, or nearly the same mass, they would rotate around a central point 
located somewhere between them. But the proton has about 1840 times as much mass as the electron. Therefore, 
the proton hardly moves. The electron moves around it, somewhat like a planet in orbit around the sun. 
1-25  
The protons, neutrons, and electrons in every element are identical. But the numbers of protons, neutrons, and 
electrons differ, as shown in Figure 1.2 below. These differences make one element different from another.

Structure of Atoms (continued) 
1-26  
When the number of protons in the nucleus equals the number of orbiting electrons, the atom is electrically 
neutral. That is, the atom as a whole has no electrical charge. But in some atoms, the outermost electrons are 
attracted to the nucleus only weakly. The force of attraction is weak because of the inner electrons. The inner 
electrons repel the outer electrons. This force combines with the attraction of the protons, creating a weak force 
on the outer electrons. 
1-27  
In such an atom, one or more of the outermost electrons can escape from the atom. Each electron that escapes 
removes one unit of negative charge from the atom, leaving the remainder of the atom with a net positive charge. 
 
Electron Shells 
1-28  
If it were possible to see the electrons around the nucleus of an atom, you would see a sort of cloud in the shape 
of a hollow sphere. The drawing in Figure 1.3 below is a rough idea of how an atom of oxygen might look. If you 
could look very closely at the electron cloud in a real atom, you might see a few layers within the cloud. The 16 
electrons of an oxygen atom exist within this cloud, but not as compact objects moving on simple paths. You 
would not see individual electrons moving like planets in orbit around a sun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.3: Electron Cloud

Electron Shells (continued) 
1-29  
To understand the behavior of an atom, it helps to think of the electrons in a rather simple way. You should think 
of the electrons as being arranged around the nucleus in shells of different size. You can picture each shell as a 
thin, hollow sphere. Several shells can surround the nucleus of the atom, the larger ones surrounding the smaller 
ones, as shown in Figure 1.4 below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1-30  
Each "shell" can contain only a certain maximum number of electrons. The innermost shell, the one closest to the 
nucleus, can contain a maximum of only two electrons. That is, it can contain either one electron, or two. In the 
hydrogen atom, this shell contains only one electron. In all other atoms, it contains a full set of two electrons. 
1-31  
The second shell is larger than the first. It can contain up to eight electrons. The third shell is still larger, and can 
contain up to 18 electrons. The fourth shell can contain 32. 
 
 
Figure 1.4: Electron Shells 

11 
 
Electron Shells (continued) 
1-32  
If you "look" at the electron shells a little closer, the picture is a little more complicated. All shells except the 
innermost one are divided into subshells. The second shell is divided into two subshells, the third into three 
subshells, and the fourth into four subshells. In each case, the innermost subshell can contain up to two electrons, 
the second can contain up to six electrons, the third can contain up to ten, and the fourth can contain up to 14. 
Figure 1.5 shows the subshells for the first three electron shells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1-33  
Table 1-1 on the following page shows the electron distribution of the first 55 atoms. You can see that the first 
ten atoms make up a simple pattern as the electrons fill the first two shells. The inner shell fills up first with two 
electrons, and then the second shell fills up with eight. When the second shell fills, the first two go into the inner 
subshell and the next six go into the outer subshell. 
1-34  
As the third shell begins filling, the pattern becomes more complicated. The first subshell fills first with two 
electrons. Then the second subshell fills with six. But before the third subshell begins to fill, the first subshell of 
the fourth shell fills. Notice that another odd series begins with element 37. 
1-35  
The chemical and the electrical behavior of atoms depends on how completely the various shells and subshells 
are filled. The atoms that are most active chemically are those that have one electron more or one electron less 
than a completely-filled shell. Atoms that have the outer shell exactly filled are chemically inactive. They are all 
gases that do not combine chemically with other elements. These gases are called inert elements. You can identify 
these inert elements in Table 1-1 on the following page.

Table 1-1 

13 
 
Electron Shells (continued) 
1-36  
Elements that belong to the class called metals are good electrical conductors. In these elements, the electrons 
in the outer shells and subshells can easily move from one atom to another. In moving from atom to atom, they 
carry charge through the material. 
1-37  
You can see which atoms in Table 1-1 are classified as metals. They are marked with an asterisk (*) in front of the 
element name. Many of these elements have "gaps" in their electron shells and subshells. The first group with 
gaps consists of atoms 19-28. 
1-38  
As you can see from studying Table 1-1, some elements without gaps are among the best conductors, for example, 
aluminum (No. 13) and copper (No. 29). And some elements with gaps are not good conductors, for example, 
iodine (No. 53), which is missing subshell 4 of shell 4. But in general, most elements that have gaps in their electron 
shells and subshells are good conductors of electricity. 
 
Transferring Charges 
1-39  
Under certain conditions, one or two of the outermost electrons of an atom can be stripped away from an atom 
and transferred somewhere else. This process leaves the atom with a net positive charge. Something else in the 
universe then has a net negative charge. 
1-40  
For example, if you rub a piece of plastic with fur or wool, electrons are stripped away from some of the atoms in 
the wool and transferred to the plastic. The plastic then becomes negatively charged, because it has an excess of 
electrons. The fur or wool becomes positively charged, because it has a deficiency of electrons. Figure 1.6 shows 
this redistribution of charge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.6: Charge Redistribution on a Plastic Rod 

14 
 
Transferring Charges (continued) 
1-41  
Likewise if you rub a glass rod with silk, electrons are stripped away from some of the atoms in the glass. The glass 
rod then becomes positively charged, because it has lost electrons. The silk becomes negatively charged, because 
it has gained electrons. Figure 1.7 shows how the charges are redistributed on the glass and silk. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1-42  
You should note that electricity is not created in either of these examples. The total number of electrons in the 
universe always remains unchanged. Some electrons are moved from one place to another, but the excess in one 
place equals the deficiency in the other. The balance remains perfect. 
1-43  
The balance for the universe as a whole always remains perfect. For every extra electron in one place, there is an 
electron missing somewhere else. Thus, for every positively-charged object, there is a net negative charge of 
exactly the same amount in the remainder of the universe. For every negatively-charged object, there is a net 
positive charge of exactly the same amount in the remainder of the universe.

Electrical Forces 
1-44  
Objects having electrical charges can exert forces on each other. These forces are the strongest forces known in 
nature. No other forces—magnetic, gravitational, or nuclear forces— are as strong as electrical forces for objects 
of the same size or separated by the same distance. Electrical forces attract two objects that have 
opposite charges (one positive and one negative). They repel two objects that have identical charges 
(both positive or both negative). 
1-45  Figure 1.8 shows a common way to demonstrate the forces of attraction and repulsion. The plastic ball 
shown at the far left has no charge. It is then given a negative charge by rubbing it with fur. A plastic rod, 
also charged negatively, is then brought near the ball. The ball swings away from the rod, because the 
two objects have the same charge. The same thing would happen if the ball and the rod both had a 
positive charge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1-46  
Next, a positively-charged glass rod is brought near the negatively-charged ball. The ball swings toward the glass 
rod because of the attraction between the opposite charges. A negative rod would attract a positive ball for the 
same reason. 
1-47  
The forces of attraction and repulsion between electrical charges give shape and substance to the world. Atoms 
that share electrons in chemical bonds are held together by the forces of attraction between unlike charges. 
1-48  
When you press your hand against something solid, there is an electrical force repelling your hand from the object. 
This force exists because electrons in the atoms of your hand repel the electrons of the object. If the electrical 
force of repulsion did not exist, your hand would pass right through the solid object, because every atom is mostly 
empty space.

Electrical Terms 
1-49  
As you study electricity in your training program, and as you work with electricity in the plant, you will hear, read, 
and use various electrical terms. These terms have very exact meanings. You must know what each one means if 
you are to understand other people and make them understand you. The following paragraphs explain the 
meaning of the most basic electrical terms. Other terms will be explained in other Lessons and Units as you need 
them. 
1-50  
Electric current. When electrons flow from one place to another, they make a current. The electrons always flow 
from a negative point to a positive (or less negative) point, because electrons have a negative charge. 
1-51  
Unfortunately, the direction of current flow can be confusing. Some people think of a positive current that is in 
the opposite direction from the electron flow.  That is, from positive to negative instead of from negative to 
positive. You must be careful to distinguish between the two kinds of flow. Both kinds are commonly used, both 
in words and in diagrams. 
1-52  
The so-called "positive current" is from positive to negative. The "electron flow" is from negative to positive. In 
these training manuals, we will always use the word "current" to mean electron flow—from negative to positive. 
Figure 1.9 shows the difference between positive current and electron flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1-53  
Circuit. Electrons flow along some kind of path in going from one point to another. This path is called a circuit. If 
the path has no gaps to stop the flow of electrons, the circuit is said to be "complete." 
 
 
 
Figure 1.9: Two Directions of Electric Current 

17 
 
Electrical Terms (continued) 
1-54  
If the path has a gap that the electrons cannot cross, such as a break in a wire where the ends are separated by 
air, the circuit is said to be "open." If another pathway provides an easier way or a shortcut for the electrons to 
go from one point to another, that part of the circuit is said to be "shorted." Figure 1.10 shows circuits that are 
complete, open, and shorted. 
 
1-55 
Potential difference. This term is the correct name for what is often called "voltage" or "electromotive force." 
Potential difference is a measure of how much potential energy an electron has in one place compared to another 
place. 
1-56 
The greater the potential energy, the more work an electron can do in going from one place to the other. The 
potential energy of each electron also determines how much current will flow from one point to another in a given 
circuit. 
1-57  
Resistance. Every electrical pathway from one place to another has the property of resisting the flow of 
electrons. Some pathways resist the flow only slightly. For example, a thick copper wire offers very little 
resistance. Other pathways—for example, an air gap—offer great resistance. The greater the resistance, the less 
the current for a given potential difference. 
1-58  
Cell. Electricity can be produced by chemical means. The arrangement of materials that produces a potential 
difference between two points by chemical means is called a cell. Familiar cells include the "dry cells" 
used in flashlights, calculators, and radio. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.10: Electric Circuits 

18 
 
Electrical Terms (continued) 
1-59  
Battery. When you connect two or more cells together, the combination is called a battery. If your calculator takes 
two dry cells, the combination is called a "two-cell battery." 
1-60  
The storage battery in a car or truck is usually a six-cell battery that produces a potential difference of 12 volts 
between the terminals. Each cell in such a battery produces a potential difference of two volts between its internal 
terminals. The terminals of the cells are connected in such a way that their potential differences add together 
between the external terminals. 
1-61  
As you study the remaining Lessons in this Unit, and the other Units in your course, make sure you learn the proper 
terms to use in discussing electricity, and the exact meaning of each term. Always use the correct terms, even if 
other people do not. If you use the wrong terms, you are likely to be misunderstood. In addition, other people will 
think you know less about electricity than you actually do.

Summary 
The industrial world is largely an electrical world. Most equipment and machinery operates on electricity. It is matter, 
molecules made up of atoms, that makes electricity possible. Atoms are made up of electrons, protons, and neutrons. 
The center of the atom is called the nucleus. It contains protons and neutrons. Electrons revolve around the nucleus. 
The relationship between the protons and the electrons creates force. This force attracts or repels objects depending 
on whether the objects have opposite charges or the same charge. Objects with opposite charges attract each other. 
Objects with the same charge repel each other. 
Electricity in motion is called current electricity. Electricity that does not move is called static electricity. When electrons 
flow, they create a current. The path they flow along is called a circuit. The measure of how much potential energy an 
electron has in one place compared to another place is called potential difference. 
Electricity can also be created by chemical means. A cell is an arrangement of materials that produces a potential 
difference between two points. Cells are used in combination to make batteries.

In this Lesson, we explain what static electricity is, what causes it, and steps you can take to reduce or prevent it in the 
plant. We explain bonding and grounding techniques, and when and where they should be used. We also list static 
eliminators that can be attached or applied to materials, machinery, and equipment. 
This Lesson also includes the practical applications of static electricity in the plant. Finally, it explains the use of 
instruments for measuring static electricity. 
 
 
 

24 
 
Nature of Static Electricity 
2-1 
Static Electricity is electricity that does not move.  The word static comes from the Greek word statikos, meaning 
the act of making something stand still.  Static electricity consists of electrical charges that remain unmoving on 
an object. 
2-2 
Static electricity usually is generated by the physical contact and separation of different kinds of materials. Various 
effects result from the formation of positive and negative charges. Static electricity cannot be avoided, because 
electric charges are naturally present in all objects. 
2-3 
Static electricity can cause problems in industrial equipment. It can interfere with the operation of electronic 
equipment, and it can cause sparks that ignite flammable liquids and vapors. In order to prevent these problems, 
you must understand the nature of static electricity. 
2-4 
Electrical charges themselves cannot cause a fire or explosion. In order for static electricity to cause ignition, four 
conditions must exist. 
 
There must be a means of generating static charges. 
 
There must be a means of maintaining a potential difference.  
 
The potential difference between the charges must be great enough to cause breakdown of the resistance of 
the air between them. 
 
The spark must occur in a flammable atmosphere. 
 
2-5 
Some of the most common causes of static electricity are listed here. 
 
Pulverized materials passing through chutes or pneumatic conveyors 
 
Steam, air, gases, or nonconductive liquids discharging from a pipe or hose 
 
Nonconductive powered conveyor belts in motion 
 
Moving vehicles 
 
People walking on nonconductive carpeting or waxed floors 
 
Generating Static Electricity 
2-6  
When two unlike materials are pressed together, some of the electrons at the surfaces transfer from one material 
to the other. When the two materials are then separated, more of the electrons remain with one material than 
with the other. As a result, the material having more electrons has a negative charge. The other material has an 
equal positive charge, because it lacks the same number of electrons. 
2-7  
If a conductive path becomes available, the extra electrons on one material will rush to the other material. Then 
both materials will become electrically neutral again, or nearly so. If there is no conductive path between them, 
the two materials may remain charged even if the potential difference between them builds up to several 
thousand volts. 
2-8  
On some materials, for example concrete and asphalt, the charges are somewhat mobile. After these materials 
become charged, they will slowly discharge until they become electrically neutral again. 

25 
 
Generating Static Electricity (continued) 
2-9  
On insulating materials, for example plastic or rubber, the charges are unable to move freely. These materials can 
remain charged for a long time, even if the potential difference becomes fairly high. 
Effects of Static Electricity 
2-10  
The human body is a good electrical conductor. In a dry atmosphere, you can pick up static charges from certain 
manufacturing operations. You can also pick up a charge as your shoes make and break contact with floor 
coverings, especially carpeting. 
2-11  
These charges become distributed over the entire surface of your body. The potential difference between your 
body and other objects in the plant may reach several thousand volts. Yet you may feel nothing unusual. 
2-12  
If your clothing and shoes are moist enough, for example, when the humidity is high, static charges will drain away 
quickly into the air. They will never build up and produce a large potential difference between your body and 
other objects in the plant. But if the air is very dry, the potential difference may become large enough to make a 
spark jump when you come near an object. 
2-13  
If you work in an area filled with flammable liquids, explosive gases, or fine dusts, you must take special 
precautions to prevent sparks from occurring. Do not wear rubber shoes or boots when handling flammable 
liquids. Wear shoes with soles made of leather or other conductive material. Leather absorbs moisture, so that it 
provides a conductive path to drain away static charges as they occur. 
2-14  
If your shoes have steel toe protectors, heel plates, or nails, then they are conductive, no matter what other 
materials they are made of. 
2-15  
The shock from a static charge may sting, and under some circumstances it may lead to an injury. The injury will 
probably not come from the shock itself, but from your reaction to the shock. 
2-16  
For example, the normal human reaction to a shock on the hand is to pull your hand away quickly. This action is 
an automatic reflex action that you do not even think about. But the rapid, uncontrolled action may cause your 
hand to strike another object or to enter a hazardous area on a machine, leading to a serious injury. 
2-17  
Some clothing materials can build up a large static charge. Removing a jacket, a sweater, or other garment can 
be dangerous in an area where the atmosphere is flammable or explosive. 
 
 

26 
 
Eliminating Static Electricity 
2-18  
Static electricity can be eliminated from metal equipment by bonding and by grounding. These two techniques 
are shown in Figure 2.1. 
 
Bonding is the creation of an electrical connection between two or more metallic objects. The connection is 
usually made by means of a metal wire or a metal strap. 
 
Grounding is the electrical connection of an object to the earth by means of a grounding device. 
Bonding minimizes the potential difference between two objects. Grounding minimizes the potential difference 
between an object and the earth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.1: Bonding and Grounding 
2-19 
A metal object can be grounded by bonding it to another metal object that is grounded. Some metal objects are 
bonded or grounded simply by touching another metal object that is connected to the earth. Common examples 
of good grounds include underground metal piping and large storage tanks resting on the ground. 
2-20 
Bonding and grounding wires should be large enough to handle the largest currents that are likely to occur. A 
grounding wire should be no smaller than AWG No. 8. This size is large enough to provide mechanical strength 
as well as a large current-carrying capacity. 
2-21 
Solid wire is good enough for permanent, stationary connections. A flexible conductor should be used if the 
objects are to be connected and disconnected often, or if they can move relative to each other. 
 
 
 

27 
 
Static Eliminators 
2-22  
Static charges distribute themselves on objects according to definite rules. For example, the charges distribute 
themselves evenly on the surface of a perfect sphere. On objects with sharp points, the charges become 
concentrated at the points. 
2-23  
The photographs in Figure 2.2 show how static charges are distributed on two-dimensional models of several basic 
shapes. The particles surrounding these models are distributed in the same way as the electrical charges on the 
model. The particles show that the charges are concentrated at points where two surfaces meet at a sharp angle. 
The sharper the angle, the more charge is concentrated in that area. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.2: Static Charge Distribution 
 
 
NOTE: To make these photographs, grass seeds were floated on a shallow pool of clear vegetable 
oil in a small glass-bottomed tank. The shaped electrodes were made of brass strips soldered 
together at the joints. The wire clipped to each electrode was connected to a static generator that 
produced many thousands of volts. The grass seeds formed "chains" perpendicular to the charged 
electrode. They did not necessarily touch the electrode.  
The grass seeds appear white on the surface of the oil. The dark spots are shadows cast by the 
seeds onto the laboratory floor under the tank. 

28 
 
Static Eliminators 
2-24  
A static comb is a metal bar having many points. It may be a bar with metal flaps hanging from it, or it may be a 
wire rod covered with metal tinsel. Both forms are shown in Figure 2.3. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-25  
When a grounded static comb is brought close to a charged surface, as shown in Figure 2.3, the charge on the 
surface induces the opposite charge on the comb. The induced charge becomes highly concentrated at the points 
on the comb, just as shown in Figure 2.2. 
2-26  
The high concentration of charge around the points breaks down some of the air molecules, producing electrically-
charged atoms called ions. These ions are repelled by the charge on the points, and conduct charges away from 
the charged surface. Thus, the charge can be removed from fabrics, belts, paper, and other surfaces. 
Effects of Humidity 
2-27  
You probably have noticed that you often get a shock after walking across a carpet in dry weather. But if the air is 
moist, you do not get a shock. The difference is caused by the difference in the moisture content of the air. 
2-28  
Cloth, wood, paper, concrete, and other non-conducting materials contain moisture that affects their ability to 
get rid of static charges. The amount of moisture they contain depends on the humidity of the air. 
2-29  
When the humidity is high, materials absorb moisture from the air. The moisture they absorb forms a conducting 
film on the surface of the fibers and grains of the material. This film conducts electric charges easily. 
2-30  
When static electricity causes problems in materials-processing equipment, adding moisture to the air may be 
the solution. The material going through the machine absorbs moisture, and the moisture drains off the static 
charges. By eliminating the charge, you can often solve the problems. 
2-31  
Sometimes it is not practical to humidify the air where static electricity might cause problems. High humidity 
can damage some materials, and it can cause other problems in the processing machinery. 
Figure 2.3: Static Eliminators 

29 
 
Effects of Humidity (continued) 
2-32  
Furthermore, raising the humidity will not reduce the buildup of static charges on an oily solid or on an oily 
liquid. Oily surfaces do not absorb water, and therefore cannot acquire a conductive path for electric charges. 
Such a material can accumulate a static charge even with 100 percent relative humidity in the air. The charges 
must be removed in other ways. 
 
Static Charges on a Liquid Surface 
2-33  
A static charge is generated when a liquid flows and makes contact with other materials. Static charges occur 
commonly when liquids flow through pipes. They also occur during mixing, pouring, pumping, filtering, and 
agitating. Micro-filters and filters made of clay increase the ability of some liquids to develop static charges. 
2-34  
Under certain conditions, enough static charge may build up to cause a spark in a product or other flammable 
liquid. However, crude oils do not produce enough static electricity to cause self-ignition. 
2-35  
The electrical resistance of a liquid is a measure of its ability to hold a charge. The higher the resistance, the 
greater the ability of the liquid to hold a charge. 
2-36  
Very pure water has high resistance, and is capable of holding an electrical charge. Ordinary tap water contains 
dissolved minerals that are good conductors of electricity. Static charges leak off tap water as rapidly as they are 
formed. 
2-37  
When an electrically-charged liquid is poured, pumped, or transferred to a container, static charges become 
distributed on the outer surfaces of the liquid. These surfaces are in contact with the container or with the air-
space above the liquid. These "surface charges" are usually responsible for any problems that occur. 
2-38  
Most large containers are made of metal, Therefore they can conduct electricity, regardless of whether they make 
electrical contact with the earth or not. If the container is grounded, any charges in the liquid flow to the earth 
very quickly. 
2-39  
If the container is not grounded, the charge on the metal wall is opposite the charge on the liquid. The two charges 
partially neutralize each other until the liquid and the container become stable. 
2-40  
The time required for stabilization can range from a fraction of a second to a few minutes. After stabilization, 
there is usually a potential difference between the earth and the tank, and also between the earth and the liquid. 
2-41 
If there is a potential difference between any part of the liquid surface and the metal tank, a spark may jump to 
the container wall. Such a spark is likely to cause ignition if a flammable mixture of vapor and air is present above 
the liquid. For this reason, the danger of explosion is greater in a partially-filled tank than in one that is completely 
filled. 
 
 
 

30 
 
Static Charges on a Liquid Surface 
2-42  
Surface charges can be generated in several ways inside a tank. 
 
by spraying or splashing of the liquid 
 
by air or gas bubbling through the liquid 
 
by jet or propeller action 
 
by convection currents within the liquid 
 
2-43 
Grounding of a very large container may not be sufficient to remove all the electrical charges. In addition to 
grounding, a further precaution can be taken against spark ignition by "purging" the container. 
2-44 
To purge a container, the vapor above the liquid is replaced with nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or some other 
nonflammable gas. Purging also eliminates the oxygen necessary for combustion. Even if a spark occurs, it cannot 
ignite the vapor in the absence of oxygen. 
Static Charges on Rubber-Tired Vehicles 
2-45  
Vehicles with rubber tires can accumulate static electricity, especially when the tires and the pavement are dry. 
The static charges are generated as the tires roll on the pavement and during filling of the tank with liquid. 
2-46  
A significant static charge can develop when tank trucks are loaded through open domes. If the tires are dry, a 
potential difference can develop between the vehicle and a grounded piping system. Then a spark may jump 
between the edge of the tank opening and the fill pipe. 
2-47  
To avoid sparking when filling a tank truck, an electrical bond should be made between the fill pipe and the tank, 
as shown in Figure 2.4. The connection should be made before the dome is opened. It should not be removed 
until after the dome is closed. 
 
 
Figure 2.4: Bonding for Filling a Tank Truck 

31 
 
Static Charges on Rubber-Tired Vehicles (continued) 
2-48  
One end of the bonding wire should be permanently connected to the fill pipe, which in turn is connected to 
ground. The other end of the bonding wire should have an attachment clip that will pull away easily if the truck 
drives off before the bonding wire is removed. 
2-49  
No external bonding wire is needed for unloading flammable liquids into an underground tank, as shown in Figure 
2.5. Any charge in the liquid is removed as it flows through the metal nozzle, because the nozzle is grounded by 
its contact with the metal opening in the tank.

32 
 
Static Charges on Rubber-Tired Vehicles (continued) 
2-50  
When filling a portable container, the same grounding rules apply as when filling a truck. 
 
Keep the metal fill spout, nozzle, or pipe in contact with the opening in the container. 
 
Keep any metal funnels or strainers in contact with the nozzle and the container. 
 
If electrical contact cannot be maintained between the fill pipe and container, a bonding wire should be used 
between them. 
Two protective measures used in filling a container are shown in Fig. 2-6. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Static Charges on Dusts and Fibers 
2-51  
Dust removed from a surface can develop an electric charge. The kind and amount of charge depends on the 
properties of the material, the size of the particles, the amount of contact, and how well the material conducts 
electricity. 
2-52  
You cannot prevent the generation of an electrostatic charge when you move dust. High humidity or grounding 
the surface from which the dust is moved will not eliminate the charge. Also, the method used in removing the 
dust does not affect the intensity of the charges or how they are distributed. 
2-53 
Combustible dust can be ignited by a static discharge. Dusts of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and 
other metals require less energy for ignition than do dusts that contain carbon. 
2-54 
Mixing, blending, grinding, and screening solid, nonconductive materials can generate static electricity. The 
strength of the charge determines whether or not a spark can be produced. 
2-55 
Bonding and grounding all metal parts are common methods of draining off static charges accumulated when 
solid materials are processed. This method may not prevent a static charge on the dust produced during 
processing, but it reduces the overall charge.

Static Charges in Process Machinery 
2-56 
Coating, spreading, and impregnating operations are quite similar. Each operation involves the application of 
solutions to fabrics, paper, and other materials, often with knives or rollers. Static charges are often produced in 
each of these operations. 
2-57  
The material to be processed usually comes off a roll at one end of the machine. In processing, the material 
either passes over a series of rollers, under a spreader, or through a tank between squeeze rollers. 
2-58  
The material may then pass over a steam table or drying table, a belt, or an oven. Then it may be wound on a 
reel or stacked on skids. At each step, static electricity can be generated by the movement of the material over 
or between parts of the machine. 
2-59  
When flammable liquids are used in a process, you must take special precautions against ignition of the liquid 
or its vapors. Static eliminators can be installed where the roll of material is unwound and where it passes over 
rollers or under spreading knives. The frame of the machine should be grounded by a conductor that cannot 
easily be removed or broken. Figure 2.7 shows the installation of static eliminators and grounding wires on a 
typical process machine.

A flat belt made of rubber or leather running at moderate or high speed can generate a very high static charge. It 
can cause sparks several inches long. These belts are usually good insulators, because they are dry. 
2-61  
The belt generates static charges at the point where it separates from the pulley. The charge can develop 
regardless of whether the pulleys or other machinery parts are conductive or nonconductive.

A conductive dressing applied to the belt can prevent the generation of static charges. However, the coating must 
be applied frequently to remain effective. Grounded metal combs placed close to the inside of the belt are 
effective in removing most of the static charges. Figure 2.8 shows examples of where static eliminators may be 
located on a belt drive. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-63  
Special conducting belts can be used in areas where there is a danger of fire or explosion. These belts eliminate 
most of the static charge as it is generated. 
2-64  
Conveyor belts usually run at low speeds. At these speeds, they do not normally generate static charges. However, 
if the materials being transported are very dry, or if the belt runs at a speed higher than normal, it can generate 
static electricity. 
2-65  
Materials dropping from the end of a conveyor belt into a hopper or chute may be charged with static electricity. 
The belt supports and pulleys should be electrically bonded to the hopper or chute if these static charges are likely 
to cause problems. 
2-66  
If the machinery frame is not grounded, the metal pulleys acquire a charge opposite to the charge on the belt. 
Grounding the frame drains these charges from the pulley through the shaft and bearing, and thus to ground. 
Machinery frames are usually conductive to prevent isolated metal parts from holding static charges. 
2-67  
Ball bearings and journal bearings conduct electricity well enough to remove static charges from the shaft and 
other rotating equipment. But the discharge of static electricity through the oil film on a bearing sometimes 
roughens and pits the bearing surfaces, shortening its life. 
2-68  
In situations where the bearings are damaged by static discharges, you can bond the pulley shaft to the journal 
housing by means of a brush made of metal or carbon.

Static Charges in Process Machinery (continued) 
2-69  
In a printing plant, paper running through a press generates static charges. The charges can accumulate on the 
paper at many points on the press. Some of the most important places are listed below. 
 
The point where the paper is removed from the roll or stack 
 
The point where the paper first touches the roll or feeder device carrying it to the printing surface 
 
Between the rollers and printing plates 
 
At handling stations between the printing plates and the final delivery of the paper 
2-70  
The most common method of removing static electricity from a printing press is to ground the frame. Static 
eliminators placed close to the paper will help remove the charges. But eliminating static charges at some points 
does not prevent them from being generated at other points on the press. 
2-71  
Even removing the static charge from one side of the paper may not remove the charge from the other side. Static 
eliminators are needed at various places, as shown in Figure 2.9. 
 
2-72  
Spraying paints, varnishes, lacquers, and other coatings with air often generates static electricity. But the charges 
generated are not high, and therefore the hazard is not serious. 
2-73  
However, airless spraying generates high static charges, and does create an important hazard. Static charges 
accumulate on the object being sprayed, and also on the spray gun. When liquid being sprayed is flammable, a 
serious hazard exists. 

36 
 
Static Charges in Process Machinery (continued) 
2-74  
If the object being sprayed is conductive, it should be bonded to the spraying equipment. In addition, the spray 
equipment should be grounded. 
2-75  
Steam released into the air can also carry static charges. If the steam condenses on a cool surface, the surface 
may acquire a charge from the steam. 
2-76  
You should be careful in using a steam jet around flammable materials. If steam cleaning presents a hazard, the 
steam pipes and nozzles should be grounded, and the object being cleaned should also be grounded. 
 
Using Static Electricity 
2-77  
So far in this Lesson, we have discussed only how to remove, reduce, or prevent static electricity. However, 
there are many practical uses for static electricity. For example, static electricity attracts ink to the paper in an 
electrostatic copying machine. 
2-78  
Electrostatic filters remove dust and other solid materials from the air in plants and offices. In an electrostatic 
filter, the air passes through wire grids that have a high electric charge. The air becomes ionized in passing 
through these grids, and the ions transfer charges to the particles of dust. 
2-79  
Then the air passes over a second set of grids. These grids carry a charge opposite to the charge on the first set. 
The dust particles are attracted to these grids, as shown in Figure 2.10.

2-80  
Another use of static electricity is in spraying paint. It is almost impossible to spray an even coat of paint on some 
objects, because they have a complicated shape. This problem can be solved by using static electricity. 
2-81  
The object to be painted is charged either positively or negatively. The paint is given the opposite charge as seen 
in Figure 2.11.  The paint is then attracted to the object, and covers it evenly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2-82  
The simplest instrument for detecting static electricity is the electroscope, shown in Figure 2.12. When a charged 
object comes near the plate on top of the electroscope, the pivoted arm rotates away from the vertical position.

Measuring Static Electricity (continued) 
2-83 
The electrostatic voltmeter is a more precise version of the leaf electroscope.  It operates by electrostatic 
attraction between movable and stationary metal vanes.  No current passes through the meter because the vanes 
are insulated from the charged object.  Electrostatic voltmeters can measure potential differences of 100 to 5,000 
volts. 
2-84 
The most sensitive instrument for measuring static electricity is an electrostatic amplifier.  This instrument can 
measure potential differences as low as 0.1 volts.  It can measure static charges accurately because it drains almost 
no charge from the object during measurement.

Summary 
Static electricity is electricity that does not move. Its accumulation can cause problems in the plant if steps are not 
taken to prevent or reduce static charges. The charges themselves are not dangerous. But under the right conditions 
they can jump a gap and cause an explosion. 
You can help reduce the danger of static electricity in the plant by wearing shoes with soles made of leather. Do not 
wear rubber shoes or boots, shoes with steel toe protectors, heel plates, or nails, especially near flammables. 
Static electricity can be eliminated from metal equipment by bonding and grounding. Other static eliminators include 
static combs, conductive dressings, and the use of humidity. 
There are times when you can use static electricity in your work. Certain printing and spray painting operations require 
the use of static charges, for example. 
Static electricity can be measured with instruments ranging from simple to very sensitive. These include the 
electroscope, the electrostatic voltmeter, and the electrostatic amplifier.

Potential difference is what makes electrons now. This now of electrons produces the electricity that operates the 
machines and equipment in the plant. However, there is more to electricity than simply flipping a switch or pressing a 
button. 
 
In this Lesson, we explain the six main ways in which a potential difference is produced, and present examples of each 
method. Because cells are an important means of producing electricity, we explain the different types of cells and 
batteries. 
 
Cells are just one important category of electricity-producing devices commonly used in industrial applications. In this 
Lesson, we explain how electricity is created from electromagnetism, contact, heat, light, and deformation. 
 
 
 
 

44 
 
Electric Current and Energy 
3-1  
Electricity in motion is called current electricity. It occurs whenever electrons are in motion. As the electrons 
move, they transfer energy from one place to another. For this reason, current electricity is extremely useful. 
3-2  
Energy is a measure of the ability to do work. Many things in nature have this ability, in different ways. 
Examples include chemical bonds between atoms, electrons at the terminals of a battery or generator, 
moving molecules, and radiation from hot materials or from a nuclear reaction. 
3-3  
The amount of energy in a closed system is constant. It neither increases nor decreases. But specific parts of the 
system may increase or decrease in energy. For example, think about what happens in a coal-fired power plant. 
3-4  
As the coal burns, certain chemical bonds are broken and others are formed, resulting in an overall decrease in 
the amount of chemical energy in the coal. At the same time, the molecules of gas in the furnace move faster than 
before, increasing their energy of motion. 
3-5  
The rapidly-moving molecules of gas strike the walls of the boiler tubes, making the atoms of metal vibrate harder. 
After a gas molecule hits the wall, it rebounds at a lower speed. Therefore, the energy of the gas molecule is 
reduced. The metal atoms in the boiler tubes vibrate faster, so their energy is increased. 
3-6  
The vibrating atoms on the inside surface of the tube strike water molecules, making the water molecules move 
faster. The metal atoms decrease in motion and energy, and the water increases in motion and energy. The 
increase in motion turns the water into steam. A molecule of water in steam has much more energy than a 
molecule in liquid water, because it is moving much faster. 
3-7  
It is possible to continue this step-by-step analysis of what happens in the system. But you need only recognize 
that in each step one part of the system decreases in energy as another part increases in energy. The final step is 
an increase in the energy of electrons at the output terminals of the generator. 
3-8  
All matter is electrical, because it contains electrons. But the electrons do not move through a conductor unless 
there is a potential difference between the ends of the conductor. 
3-9  
The six main methods of producing the required potential difference are listed below. Each method is explained 
in this chapter.

Electricity from Chemical Action 
3-10  
The basic device for making electricity by chemical action is the electrochemical cell. Two or more of these cells 
can be connected together to make a battery.  Figure 3.1 shows the basic construction of an electrochemical cell. 
Two plates, made of different materials, are immersed in a special solution called an electrolyte. Sulfuric acid is 
often used as an electrolyte. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-11  
Chemical reactions take place between the electrolyte and the two plates. As a result of these reactions, electrons 
leave one plate, pass through the electrolyte, and enter the other plate. In this way a potential difference is 
created between the two plates. The plate where the electrons collect becomes the negative plate, called the 
cathode. The other plate becomes the positive plate, called the anode. 
3-12  
Electricians are responsible for a variety of equipment that use batteries as a normal or emergency power source. 
Therefore, they must understand how batteries work, where they are located, and how to care for them. A "dead" 
or discharged battery can cause serious problems.

Primary Cells 
3-13  
While an electrochemical cell produces electricity, the negative plate is slowly used up by the chemical reaction 
with the electrolyte. When the chemical action has completely destroyed the negative plate, the cell stops 
working. 
3-14  
A one-use cell is called a primary cell. Once it stops working, it cannot be charged again. You must either replace 
the cell with a new one, or you must replace the negative plate and the electrolyte. The symbol below stands for 
a cell. 
 
 
 
3-15  
There are many kinds of primary cells for special uses. The common dry cell is the most familiar. The materials in 
this cell produce a potential difference of I .5 volts between the terminals. 
3-16  
Dry cells are manufactured in various shapes, sizes, and weights. Small dry cells are used in a pencil-size flashlight. 
Larger cells are used in equipment that requires a higher amount of current. Four 1.5-volt cells can be connected 
to produce a potential difference of 6.0 volts when needed. 
3-17  
In a dry cell, the negative "plate" is made in the shape of a container that holds the electrolyte. It is made of zinc. 
The positive plate is a carbon rod suspended in the center of the case, shown in Figure 3.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-18  
The electrolyte is a paste made of ammonium chloride. The fact that the electrolyte is not a liquid is the reason 
for calling the cell a dry cell. The cell is not actually dry. 
3-19  
A tar-paper washer on the bottom of the zinc case prevents the carbon rod from touching the case. The top of the 
case is sealed by layers of sawdust, sand, and pitch to hold the carbon rod in position and prevent the electrolyte 
from leaking out. The positive plate in a primary cell is usually made of carbon, but metals are used in some cells. 
Figure 3.2: Dry Cell 

47 
 
Primary Cells (continued) 
3-20  
When a dry cell becomes discharged in use, the electrolyte may swell, crack the case, and leak out. The paste 
causes corrosion that can ruin a flashlight or an electronic instrument. To prevent such damage, some dry-cell 
manufacturers fit a strong steel jacket around the zinc container. 
3-21  
A dry cell in storage gradually discharges. A slow chemical action, called "local action," occurs inside. In addition, 
the moisture content of the cell changes. This process occurs very slowly if the cell is stored in a cool, dry place. 
Large cells have a shelf life of a year or longer. Small cells have a shorter shelf life. 
Secondary Cells 
3-22  
A secondary cell works just like a primary cell, except that it can be recharged. The electrodes and the electrolyte 
are changed by chemical action as the cell delivers electric current. But these changes can be reversed by sending 
electric current back into the cell in the opposite direction. An automotive storage battery like the one shown in 
Figure 3.3, consists of six secondary cells. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-23  
The secondary cell is a very common device for producing electricity by chemical action. Three kinds of secondary 
cells are in common use. In the cells of an automotive battery, the positive and negative plates are both made of 
lead, and the electrolyte is sulfuric acid. 
3-24  
In another kind of secondary cell, rechargeable batteries, the plates are made of nickel and iron, and the 
electrolyte is an alkali instead of an acid. In a third kind of secondary cell, the plates are made of nickel and 
cadmium, and the electrolyte is an alkali.

Batteries 
3-25  
Cells can be connected together to make a battery that is better than a single cell. The cells can be connected in 
two basic ways. One way produces a battery with a greater capacity for delivering current. The other way produces 
a battery with a greater potential difference. 
3-26 
To produce a battery with a greater current capacity, the negative (-) terminals of all the cells should be connected 
together. All the positive (+) terminals should also be connected together. These connections are shown by the 
diagram at the far left in Figure 3.4. Cells connected in this way are said to be connected in parallel. The potential 
difference of the battery is the same as the potential difference of a single cell. 
3-27 
To increase potential difference, the positive electrode of one cell is connected to the negative electrode of the 
next, as shown by the center diagram in Figure 3.4. These cells are said to be connected in series. 
3-28  
Both the potential difference and the current capacity can be increased by connecting the cells as shown by the 
diagram at the far right in Figure 3.4. In this arrangement, groups of cells are first connected in series to provide 
the desired potential difference in each group. Then the groups are connected in parallel to provide a battery with 
the desired current capacity. The photograph in Figure 3.4 shows a large battery with the cells connected in this 
way.

Batteries (continued) 
3-29  
The chemical conditions in a charged storage battery are shown in Figure 3.5. The negative plate consists of lead, 
and the positive plate consists of lead oxide, a compound of oxygen and lead. The electrolyte is sulfuric acid, which 
consists of oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-30  
As the storage battery delivers current, oxygen from the positive plate goes into the electrolyte. Sulfur in the 
electrolyte goes to both plates, where it combines with the lead and oxygen to form lead sulfate. As a result, 
both plates become chemically identical. 
3-31  
Keeping the external circuit connected to the battery will eventually cause the battery plates to change to lead 
sulfate and the electrolyte to water. The battery is then completely discharged, and electricity stops flowing in 
the external circuit. 
3-32  
To recharge a storage battery, an external power source must force electricity to flow through the battery in the 
opposite direction, as shown in Figure 3.6. The electrical current forces oxygen to leave the electrolyte and reform 
lead oxide on the positive plate. At the same time, it forces sulfur to leave both plates and return to the electrolyte, 
changing the water back into sulfuric acid.

Batteries (continued) 
3-33  
The charging action continues until the battery is fully recharged. The battery is then ready for service again. The 
cycle of discharging and recharging can be repeated many times. 
3-34  
Storage batteries have many uses in industrial plants. For example, they provide power for lift trucks and for 
emergency lighting systems, they start engines, and they operate many DC devices.  Therefore, it is important to 
keep these batteries fully charged and ready for use at all times. 
3-35  
You must be careful when recharging lead-acid batteries. They produce flammable gases during charging. An 
accidental spark can ignite these gases, causing an explosion inside the battery. Such an explosion can break the 
battery case and throw acid on you, on other people, and on equipment in the area. 
 
Electricity from Electromagnetism 
3-36  
Most of the electricity in use every day is produced by generators and used by motors. Motors and generators 
take advantage of the close relationship between electricity and magnetism. An electric current produces a 
magnetic field, and moving a conductor through a magnetic field produces an electric current. These two effects 
form the basis for the operation of almost every piece of electrical machinery. 
3-37  
Other Lessons in this Unit and in other Units describe magnetism and generators in detail. Therefore, we will not 
describe them further in this Lesson. 
 
Electricity from Contact 
3-38  
Lessons One and Two of this Unit explained static electricity in detail. It explained how objects acquire electrical 
charges by coming into contact with other objects and then being separated from them. For example, rubbing a 
plastic rod with fur or wool creates an electric charge on the rod. It also creates the opposite electric charge on 
the fur or wool. 
3-39  
Likewise, truck tires making and breaking contact with the road can produce a static charge on the truck. Trucks 
that carry flammable materials, gasoline for example, must be carefully grounded before loading or unloading to 
avoid the possibility of igniting the fuel or its fumes with an unexpected spark. 
3-40  
The development of static charges creates a potential difference between two objects, or between each object 
and the ground. If a conducting path then forms between the objects, current can flow from one to the other. This 
current may be very high, as in lightning, but it lasts for an extremely short time. 
 
 

51 
 
Electricity from Heat 
3-41  
Another method of producing a potential difference between two points involves a device called a thermocouple. 
The beginning of the word comes from the Greek word therme, meaning "heat." A thermocouple consists of two 
different metals welded together as shown in Fig. 3.7. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-42  
When one end of a metal wire is heated, electrons usually move away from the warm end toward the cool end. 
However, in some metals the electrons move from the cool end toward the warm end. If two different metals are 
welded together at each end, and then one end is heated, a potential difference is created between the two ends. 
The potential difference is small, but it can be measured with a sensitive voltmeter. The amount of potential 
difference between the junctions becomes larger if the difference in temperature becomes larger. 
3-43  
This potential difference can produce a small current through a very high resistance. A measurement of this 
current with a sensitive ammeter can be translated into a measurement of the temperature difference between 
the two junctions of the thermocouple. 
 
 
Figure 3.7: Thermocouple 

52 
 
Electricity from Heat (continued) 
3-44  
A thermopile is made by connecting several thermocouples together in series. The combination produces a larger 
potential difference for a given temperature difference, increasing the accuracy of a temperature-measuring 
instrument. Figure 3.8 shows a thermopile connected to a voltmeter. The voltmeter is usually calibrated in degrees 
of temperature rather than in volts of potential difference. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.8: Thermopile 

53 
 
Electricity from Light 
3-45  
When light strikes certain materials, the material ejects electrons. By ejecting these charges, the material 
produces a potential difference between its front and back surfaces. This potential difference can cause current 
to flow in a circuit. 
3-46  
Devices that receive light and produce a potential difference are called photoelectric devices. The word 
photoelectric comes from the Greek word phot, meaning "light," and the word electric. The following paragraphs 
describe three kinds of photoelectric devices. 
3-47  
Photovoltaic devices consist of a transparent electrode and a base of selenium or silicon, separated by a barrier. 
The construction of the devices is shown in Figure 3.9. Light shines through the transparent electrode and the 
barrier to the base. Electrons then leave the base and move through the barrier to the transparent electrode. This 
redistribution produces a potential difference 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-48  
The photovoltaic cell is also called a solar cell. Exposing it to light from the sun can produce electricity to charge 
small batteries and operate electronic equipment. Photovoltaic cells are also used in photographic light meters. 
3-49  
Photoconductive cells are similar to resistors, but their resistance varies according to the amount of light striking 
them. A photoconductive cell has a high resistance in the dark. As the amount of light increases, the cell's 
resistance decreases. 
 
 
Figure 3.9: Photovoltaic Cell 

54 
 
Electricity from Light (continued) 
3-50  
One common kind of photoconductive cell is the cadmium sulfide cell. Figure 3.10 shows such a cell. As light shines 
on the device, the cadmium sulfide element decreases in resistance. Then more current can flow through the 
element from one metal grid to the other. This current can operate a relay or other electrical device.

Photoemission cells are electronic vacuum tubes. The cathode (negative electrode) is a curved metal plate coated 
with sodium, cesium, or barium. These materials eject electrons when light strikes them. The rate of electron 
emission increases as the intensity of the light increases. the anode (positive electrode) is a wire coated with 
sodium, cesium, or barium. Figure 3.11 shows the construction of a photoemisson cell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3-52  
The electrons emitted by the cathode are repelled by the negative charge on the cathode and attracted by the 
positive charge on the anode. Therefore, they move through the vacuum to the anode. The current increases as 
the intensity of light increases. 
3-53  
The crystals of certain materials produce a small potential difference between one side and the other when 
they are suddenly deformed. Crystals that behave in this way are called piezoelectric crystals. They include 
crystals of barium titanate, quartz, and Rochelle salts. 
 
3-54  
These crystals produce a potential difference only while deformation is occurring. If the crystal stops deforming, 
the potential difference returns to zero, even if the crystal is held in its deformed condition. As the crystal 
returns to its un-deformed shape, it produces another potential difference. This potential difference is the 
opposite of the first. Figure 3.12 on page 56 shows these effects.

Piezoelectric crystals also work in "reverse." That is, they undergo sudden deformation if a potential difference is 
applied from one side to the other. You can make such a crystal vibrate by applying a rapidly-alternating potential 
difference across it. 
3-56 
Piezoelectric crystals have two important uses. Quartz crystals are widely used in devices that must operate at 
precisely controlled frequencies. Timing devices and radio equipment are two examples of such devices. You have 
probably seen wristwatches and clocks that are controlled by quartz crystals. 
3-57 
The second important use is in turntable pickup cartridges, like the one shown in Figure 3.13. The stylus vibrates 
as it rides in the groove of a record. The diamond stylus is connected to a small crystal of Rochelle salt in the 
pickup cartridge. As the crystal vibrates, it produces a changing potential difference that matches the motion of 
the stylus. The small potential difference is then amplified, and the stronger electrical signal drives speakers to 
produce sound.

Summary 
Current electricity is a vital part of industry. For current to flow, there must be a potential difference between the ends 
of the conductor. The six main methods of producing a potential difference are by chemical action, electromagnetism, 
contact, heat, light, and deformation. 
Cells are devices for producing electricity by chemical means. A one-use cell is called a primary cell. It cannot be 
recharged. The dry cell is a common primary cell. Secondary cells are rechargeable. When two or more cells are 
connected they make up a battery. 
The current capacity of a battery can be increased by connecting the cells in parallel. To increase potential difference, 
cells should be connected in series. 
Generators and alternators are devices whose electricity is produced by electromagnetism. Static charges are produced 
by contact. 
Devices that receive light and produce a potential difference are called photoelectric devices. These include 
photovoltaic devices, photoconductive cells, and photoemission cells.

Magnets have many uses in industry. Magnetism is closely related to electricity, the source of tool, equipment, and 
machine power. Magnetic materials are used in all types of electrical devices and equipment. 
To understand electricity, you must first understand the basic principles of magnetism. In this Lesson, we explain 
magnetic force and the erects of magnetic poles, the molecular theory of magnetism, and magnetic fields. We also 
explain the left-hand rules. 
We also explain what an electromagnet is and its function in such pieces of plant equipment as lifting, holding, and 
separating devices.

Discovery of Magnetism 
4-1  
About 3000 years ago, people discovered an unusual mineral in Asia Minor. The mineral had the ability to attract 
iron objects. The mineral was found near the ancient city of Magnesia, and so it was called magnetite. It was the 
first known magnetic material. 
4-2  
Even before the discovery of magnetite in Asia Minor, the Chinese had discovered that if certain stones were 
suspended by a thread, they generally lined up in a north-south direction. Early Chinese navigators are said to 
have made crude compasses from these stones. The stones used as compasses were called "lodestones," meaning 
leading stones. The stones contained magnetite. 
4-3  
Man-made magnets were put to practical use for the first time in about the 12th century. At that time, people 
discovered that a magnet which was free to rotate would swing until it came to rest in a north-south direction. 
Thus, the magnet came into regular use as a compass. Early explorers used them in navigation. 
4-4  
The magnets used in the first compasses were made of iron. Ordinary pieces of iron were made magnetic by 
stroking them with a natural magnet. This method is not used anymore, because other methods are easier and 
they produce stronger magnets. 
4-5 
A substance is called a magnet if it has the property of attracting magnetic materials such as iron.  A bar-shaped 
magnet generally produces its strongest effect at each end.  It produces very little effect at its center. 
4-6  
The points of maximum attraction are called magnetic poles. Magnets always have two kinds of poles. One kind 
points toward the north when the magnet is suspended by a thread, and the other points toward the south. 
4-7  
The pole that points toward the north is called the "north-seeking pole," or simply the north pole. The pole that 
points toward the south is called the "south-seeking pole," or simply the south pole. 
4-8  
A magnet can be used as a compass because the earth itself is a huge magnet. One pole is located in northern 
Canada. The other pole is located in Antarctica. The magnetic poles are not located at the same points as the 
geographic poles. 
4-9  
Magnets are essential parts of many instruments and machines. Without magnetism, electric motors, generators, 
telephone receivers, and many other common devices could not work as they do. In addition, certain kinds of 
electronic equipment could not exist. 
4-10  
The causes of magnetism can be explained only by complex scientific theories. But the basic laws of magnets are 
well-known by nearly everyone. They are used every day. 
 
 

63 
 
Magnetic Forces 
4-11  
The most basic law of magnetic force is that unlike poles attract each other, and like poles repel each other. For 
example, suppose you suspend a bar magnet in the air and allow it to turn freely. Then suppose you hold another 
bar magnet in your hand, and bring its north pole near the north pole of the suspended magnet. What will happen? 
The suspended magnet will turn away from the magnet in your hand, because two like poles always repel each 
other. 
4-12  
The same thing will happen if you hold the south pole of your magnet near the south pole of the suspended 
magnet. An invisible "magnetic force" pushes any two "like" poles of the magnets away from each other. In this 
respect, "like" magnetic poles react to each other in the same way as "like" electric charges. 
4-13  
When you bring the south pole of the magnet in your hand near the north pole of the suspended magnet, the two 
"unlike" poles attract each other. The reverse is also true. When you bring the north pole of your magnet near the 
south pole of the suspended magnet, these two poles also attract each other. "Unlike" magnetic poles react to 
each other in the same way as "unlike" electric charges. 
 
Molecular Theory of Magnetism 
4-14  
The molecular theory of magnetism is based on the idea that each molecule of a magnet is itself a tiny magnet. 
The molecules in an un-magnetized bar of iron or steel are arranged at random, as shown in Figure 4.1. The overall 
effect of this random arrangement is to produce no magnetic effect at all. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.1: Molecules in Un-Magnetized Iron 

64 
 
Molecular Theory of Magnetism (continued) 
4-15  
When a magnetizing force is applied to an un-magnetized bar of iron or steel, the molecules become aligned. 
Most of the north poles point in one direction, and most of the south poles point in the opposite direction. Figure 
4.2 shows this alignment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-16  
If you break a bar magnet, each part becomes a complete magnet with a north pole and a south pole, as shown 
in Figure 4.3. The poles of these small magnets are lined up in the same directions as the poles of the unbroken 
magnet. If you continue breaking the parts, the resulting pieces will all have two poles. Even if the magnet is 
reduced to molecules, all the pieces will have two poles just like the original magnet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-17  
If a bar magnet is repeatedly hit, heated, or exposed to a strong alternating magnetic field, the molecular structure 
becomes disarranged and the bar loses some of its magnetic properties. Electric meters that depend on magnets 
become inaccurate if their permanent magnets are heated, struck, or exposed to a strong external magnetic field. 
 
 
Figure 4.2: Molecules in Magnetized Iron 
Figure 4.3: Breaking a Bar Magnet 

65 
 
Magnetic Fields 
4-18  
Whenever two objects are able to exert forces on each other from a distance, without touching each other, you 
can use the term field in describing the forces. One example of a field force is gravity. It acts on objects that have 
mass. Another is the electric force that acts on objects that carry an electric charge. 
4-19  
You know that the force of the earth's gravitational field pulls you down. It does so because you have mass. 
4-20  
You do not need to touch the earth in order for the earth's gravitational field to apply force to you. The field pulls 
on you with the same force if you fall or jump off a platform. 
4-21  
The earth's gravitational field also keeps a spacecraft in orbit, because the spacecraft has mass. Without the 
gravitational field of the earth, a spacecraft could not travel in orbit. It would move on a straight line into outer 
space. Figure 4.4 shows a satellite in orbit approximately 22,000 miles above the earth's surface. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-22  
The moon stays in orbit around the earth, because the earth's gravitational field pulls on the mass of the moon. 
The force acts even though the moon is about 250,000 miles from the earth. 
4-23  
Likewise, the earth keeps going around the sun because of the sun's gravitational field pulling on the mass of the 
earth. This force acts over a distance of 93 million miles. The sun's gravitational field pulls on other planets that 
are even farther away. 
 
 
Figure 4.4: Satellite Drawn by Earth’s Gravity 

66 
 
Magnetic Fields (continued) 
4-24  
In a similar way, an electric field exerts a force on a charged object from a distance. For example, in a leaf 
electroscope each leaf produces its own electric field. The field produced by one leaf exerts a force on the charge 
carried by the second leaf. Likewise, the field produced by the second leaf exerts a force on the charge carried by 
the first leaf. 
4-25  
In other words, the charge on each leaf is acted upon by a force caused by the electrical field of the other leaf. 
The force on each leaf of the electroscope keeps it suspended at an angle. The size of the angle is such that the 
electrical force just balances the force of the earth's gravitational field acting on the mass of the leaf, as shown in 
Figure 4.5. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-26  
A magnetic field is very similar to a gravitational field and an electrical field. But it acts on objects because of their 
magnetic properties rather than their mass or their charge. Just as in the case of gravity and electrical forces, you 
must keep two ideas in mind when you deal with magnetic forces. 
 
Every magnetic object creates a magnetic field that can affect other magnetic objects. 
 
Every magnetic object can be acted upon by the magnetic field of another object. 
 
 
Figure 4.5: Charged Electroscope 

67 
 
Magnetic Fields (continued) 
4-27  
Try to keep the idea of the field separate from the idea of the force produced by the field on a magnetic object. 
Also remember that forces always come in pairs. In every pair, each force is produced by one object and acts on 
another object. If you can avoid confusing these forces, you will find it easier to understand all field forces, 
including magnetic forces. 
4-28  
Every field has a direction. The direction may be different at different places. The direction of a magnetic field at 
any place is defined as the direction in which a compass needle points if the compass is placed at that spot. 
4-29  
Figure 4.6 shows how the direction of a magnetic field is defined. Compare the pattern of iron filings in the 
photograph to the lines in the diagram showing the field directions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-30  
Notice that the lines in the diagram are curved, just like the lines of iron filings in the photograph. The arrows on 
the lines show the direction of the field along the lines. Compare these arrows to the direction of the needles on 
the compasses in the diagram. 
 
 
Figure 4.6: Magnetic Field of a Bar Magnet 

68 
 
Magnetism and Electricity 
4-31  
Magnetic fields are important because of the relationship between magnetism and electricity. 
 
A moving charge produces a magnetic field 
 
A magnetic field exerts force on a moving charge 
4-32 
These two parts of the relationship between magnetism and electricity have great practical value. They form the 
basis for understanding motors, generators, solenoids, and many other electrical devices. 
4-33 
Every moving electric charge produces a magnetic field. The charge may be moving along a conductor, or it may 
be moving through a vacuum. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the speed and the strength of the 
charge. 
4-34  
The magnetic field is strong when the charge is moving rapidly and when the charge is strong. The field is weak 
when the charge is moving slowly and when the charge is weak. 
 
Left-Hand Rules 
4-35  
You can use two "left-hand rules" that make it easy to keep track of various directions when you work with 
electricity and magnetism. These rules show you the relationships among the following directions. 
 
The direction the electric charge moves 
 
The direction of the magnetic field 
 
The direction of the force on the moving charge 
These directions are always at right angles to one another. 
4-36 
In both left-hand rules, your left thumb always points in the direction the negative charges move. The fingers on 
your left hand always point in the direction of the magnetic field. 
4-37 
The first "left-hand rule" concerns the magnetic field produced by a moving electric charge. Figure 4.7 shows how 
this rule works. You point your left thumb in the direction the electrons are moving. At the same time, you curl 
the fingers of your left hand around the path of the electrons.

Figure 4.7: Left-Hand Rule for Field Direction 

69 
 
Left-Hand Rules (continued) 
4-38 
When your left hand is in this position, your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field produced by the 
moving electrons. The field is circular, around the path of the electrons. Figure 4.7 shows how the field would look 
if you could see it. 
4-39 
If the moving particles have a positive charge instead of a negative charge, the magnetic field will be in the 
opposite direction. You can still use the left-hand rule. But you must either point your thumb in the direction 
opposite the motion of the positive charges, or you must remember that the magnetic field is in the opposite 
direction from your fingers. 
4-40 
The second "left-hand rule" concerns the force exerted on an electric charge as it moves through a magnetic field. 
This magnetic field is not produced by the moving charge, but by a magnet or some other device. 
4-41 
Figure 4.8 shows the second left-hand rule. To use it, you hold your left hand flat, with your thumb pointing 
sideways. You position your hand so that your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field and your thumb 
points in the direction the electrons are moving. The palm of your hand then "pushes" in the same direction as 
the force the magnetic field exerts on the moving electrons. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-42 
If the moving particles have a positive charge instead of a negative charge, the force will be in the opposite 
direction. You can still use the left-hand rule. But you must either point your thumb in the direction opposite the 
motion of the positive charges, or you must reverse the direction of the force shown by your palm. 
4-43 
Another use for the second left-hand rule concerns the production of an electric current in a generator. Figure 4.9 
shows the simplest possible generator. It consists of a conductor moving through a magnetic field. As the 
conductor moves, the magnetic field forces electrons to move along the conductor.

Left-Hand Rules (continued) 
4-43 
Another use for the second left-hand rule concerns the production of an electric current in a generator. Figure 4.9 
shows the simplest possible generator. It consists of a conductor moving through a magnetic field. As the 
conductor moves, the magnetic field forces electrons to move along the conductor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-44 
To figure out which way the electrons move, you first point the fingers of your left hand in the direction of the 
magnetic field, as shown in Figure 4.9. Then you turn your palm so that it "pushes" in the direction of the force 
exerted by the field on the conductor. 
4-45 
The direction of your palm must be opposite the direction of the conductor's motion, because the magnetic field 
resists the motion of the conductor. With your hand in this position, your left thumb will point in the direction of 
the electron flow in the wire. 
 
 
Figure 4.9: Left-Hand Rule for Generators 

71 
 
Using the Left-Hand Rules 
4-46  
An example of how to apply both these rules is shown in Figure 4.10. This example shows the two conductors 
carrying alternating current to a motor. The conductors are not attached to each other, so they are free to move. 
How will the current in these conductors move them, if at all? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4-47  
Because you want to analyze two forces on two different conductors, you must use two steps. It does not matter 
which one you analyze first, but you cannot analyze both forces at the same time. 
Step 1: In one step, you analyze the force exerted on the electrons moving through the left-hand conductor. This 
force is exerted by the magnetic field produced by the right-hand conductor. Figure 4.10 shows this step. 
You start by using one left-hand rule to find the direction of the magnetic field around the right-hand conductor. 
In Figure 4.10, this field is shown by the circles around the conductor. The direction of the magnetic field is upward 
through the left-hand conductor. 
Using the other left-hand rule, you can find the direction of the force on the left-hand conductor. The rule shows 
that the force is away from the right-hand conductor. 
Step 2: In the second step, you look at the force exerted on electrons moving through the right-hand conductor 
by the magnetic field produced by the left-hand conductor. 
 
Using the first left-hand rule, you can see that the direction of the magnetic field is upward where the right-
hand conductor passes through it. Figure 4.10 shows this step. 
Then using the other left-hand rule, you can see that the force on the right-hand conductor is away from the 
left-hand conductor. 
 
 
Figure 4.10: Forces on Parallel Conductors Carrying Alternating Current 

72 
 
Using the Left-Hand Rules (continued) 
4-48  
When the alternating current reverses, two changes occur: 
 
The electron flow reverses in each conductor. 
 
The reversal in electron flow also reverses the direction of the magnetic field around each conductor. 
4-49  
If you use the left-hand rules, you can see that the force on each conductor continues to be directed away from 
the other conductor. In other words, when two conductors carry electricity in opposite directions, there is a 
force on each conductor directed away from the other. It does not matter whether the electrons reverse 
direction, provided they both reverse. 
 
Electromagnets 
4-50  
One of the most important magnetic devices using electricity is the electromagnet. An electromagnet consists of 
a coil of wire that carries an electric current. The electrons move many times in a circular path around a center. 
4-51  
You can use the first left-hand rule to figure out the direction of the magnetic field produced by an electromagnet. 
Examine Figure 4.11. Notice that the direction of the electron flow is the same for all pieces of the wire positioned 
side-by-side.

Electromagnets (continued) 
4-52  
The magnetic field produced by each piece of wire combines with the magnetic field produced by the piece next 
to it. The effect is to create a magnetic field inside the coil that has the combined strength of the fields from all 
the turns of wire. The more turns of wire in the coil, the stronger the magnetic field. 
4-53  
If you place a bar of iron or steel inside the coil, the coil's magnetic field will align the molecular magnets in the 
metal. Then the magnetic field of the device is increased by the amount of the bar's field. If a large fraction of the 
molecular magnets line up with the coil's field, the combined effect can be much stronger than the field of the coil 
alone. When the electric current stops flowing in the coil of the electromagnet, the molecular magnets of the iron 
core are allowed to return to their random arrangement. 
4-54  
To practice using the left-hand rules, try applying them to the examples shown in Figure 4.12. In each example in 
the upper row, draw arrows to show the direction of the magnetic field produced by the electric current. In the 
lower row, draw arrows to show the direction of the force acting on the moving charge. The correct answers are 
shown at the top of the following page.

Industrial Uses of Magnets 
4-55  
Some of the most common industrial uses of magnets are in lifting devices, chucks, clutches, brakes, and pulleys. 
4-56  
Lifting magnets are used in transferring pieces of iron and steel from one place to another. Many pieces of iron 
and steel have odd shapes, making them difficult to handle. But a magnet can lift odd-shaped pieces easily, hold 
them securely, and release them at the proper time. The magnet lifts without chains or slings, so it saves time and 
effort. 
4-57  
Figure 4.13 shows a lifting magnet in use. The magnet is a large coil of wire surrounded by a steel frame. The frame 
protects the coil, and also improves the lifting ability of the magnet. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.13: Lifting Magnet 

75 
 
Industrial Uses of Magnets (continued) 
4-58  
To pick up a load, the operator lowers the magnet onto the metal. Closing a switch sends an electric current 
through the coil, creating a magnetic field. The magnetic field attracts the magnetic molecules in the metal, and 
holds the metal firmly against the steel base of the magnet. To release the load, the operator opens the switch. 
When the current stops, the electromagnet loses its magnetic field. 
4-59  
A magnetic chuck is a machine-tool bed with an electromagnet built into it. The electromagnet holds iron and 
steel parts down during machining, eliminating the need for clamps. The entire surface of each part can be 
machined without obstruction. Figure 4.14 shows a shaft held in a V-shaped magnetic chuck while a deep keyway 
is milled.

Industrial Uses of Magnets (continued)

A magnetic pulley removes pieces of iron and steel from other materials—for example, wood chips, grain, coal, or 
sand. The material flows onto a moving belt which passes over a magnetized pulley, as shown in Figure 4.15.

The iron or steel is held onto the belt as it passes over the magnetic pulley. The magnetic field of the pulley holds 
the metal on the belt longer than the nonmagnetic material, so that it drops off later. The magnetic and

Summary 
A magnet is any substance that attracts magnetic materials. The points of maximum attraction are called poles. 
Every magnet has a north pole and a south pole. Magnetic poles and electrical charges react in the same way. Unlike 
poles or electrical charges attract each other while like poles or charges repel each other. 
When two objects exert force on each other from a distance without touching each other, the forces are called a field. 
The strength of the magnetic field is determined by the speed and the strength of the electric charge. 
When you work with electricity and magnetism you may use the left-hand rules. These rules are used in determining 
the direction of the electric charge, the direction of the magnetic field, and the direction of the force on the moving 
charge. When you use the left-hand rules, remember that these directions are always at right angles to one another. 
A coil of wire that carries an electric current is called an electromagnet. Electromagnets are used in lifting devices, 
chucks, clutches, brakes, and pulleys.

Electricity is a complex science with many terms that must be understood by the trainee. To work with electricity, you 
must know the meanings of such terms as ampere, volt, ohm, potential difference, and resistance. In this chapter, we 
define these terms and explain the role of these units in electricity. 
In order to work safely with electricity, you must also know the difference between an electrical conductor and an 
electrical insulator. This chapter explains the function of each and lists materials commonly found in the plant that 
conduct or insulate against electric current now. 
Personnel who must measure current flow, potential difference, and resistance can use various measuring devices. 
These include ammeters, voltmeters, and ohmmeters. 
 
 
 
 
 

82 
 
Electric Current 
5-1  
Many materials have free electrons. These electrons are not bound tightly to the atoms. They are free to move 
from one atom to another. When large numbers of these electrons move in one direction, the result is called an 
electric current. 
5-2  
In metals such as copper, the free electrons can move very easily. These materials are called electrical conductors. 
The most common electrical conductors in the plant are made of metals or carbon. 
5-3  
Materials known as electrical insulators have few free electrons. It is difficult to force any of the electrons to move 
from atom to atom. Therefore, it is difficult to produce an electric current in these materials. Some of the best 
electrical insulators are mica, porcelain, glass, rubber, silk, air, slate, paper, and certain synthetic materials, 
including plastics, silicone, and neoprene. 
5-4  
There is no sharp dividing line between conductors and insulators. Impure water is a conductor, but chemically 
pure water is an insulator. In fact, the ability of water to resist the flow of electricity is used as a measure of high 
purity. Many nonmetallic crystalline materials are good insulators. Examples include diamond and quartz. 
5-5  
Cotton, wood, and paper are good insulators, but only if they are dry. Any water in the material coats the fibers 
and conducts electricity. These fibrous materials must be saturated with mineral oil, tar, pitch, or some other 
moisture repellent in order to be used as insulators. 
5-6  
According to the kinetic theory of matter, the particles that make up a material are never completely at rest. 
The atoms, molecules, and free electrons move constantly in a random manner. If you connect the ends of a 
copper wire to the terminals of a battery, the random motion of the electrons changes to a motion directed 
toward the positive terminal. 
5-7  
Electrons at one end of a conductor respond very quickly to changes at the other end. But the electrons do not 
move through the conductor at high speed. In fact, each electron moves quite slowly. But as soon as the first 
electron moves toward the positive terminal, it displaces the next one, causing it to move forward. This 
electron in turn forces the next one to move, and so on. 
5-8  
These changes occur very rapidly. As a result, the last electrons at the far end of the wire are forced to move 
almost instantly when the first ones move. 
5-9  
This action is similar to the flow of water through a pipe. Water is not compressible, so water starts flowing from 
one end of a pipe as soon as you start forcing water into the opposite end (provided the pipe is already filled with 
water when you start). 
5-10  
Another simple way to picture electric current is to compare the conducting path to a freight train. The cars of 
the train are like the free electrons in the conductor, and the locomotive is like the battery. 
5-11  
When the locomotive starts the train moving, it pulls suddenly against the first car in the line. This slight motion 
takes the slack out of the couplers, car after car, down the line. Each car moves only a short distance, but the 
shock runs down the entire line of cars at very high speed. You can hear the shock better than you can see it. 
 
 

83 
 
Electric Current (continued) 
5-12  
An electric current is like that shock wave. Each electron in the conductor moves only a short distance. But the 
effect at one end of the conductor produces an effect at the other end very quickly. 
5-13  
The movement of electrons from atom to atom is the same everywhere along a wire. The distribution does not 
change as the electrons move. When you disconnect the battery, each atom is left with its proper number of 
electrons. The number of electrons that came out of the wire at the positive terminal is exactly equal to the 
number that entered the wire at the negative terminal. 
5-14  
Today, everyone knows that an electric current is the flow of negatively-charged electrons. The electrons flow 
from the negative terminal of a battery to the positive terminal. That is, the current flows from negative to 
positive. 
5-15  
Only a hundred years ago, no one knew what electricity was. Scientists thought something was flowing between 
the terminals of a battery. But they did not know what the "something" was. They did not know about electrons 
or that the moving material carried a negative charge. 
5-16  
The early scientists labeled the terminals of a battery "+" and "-". Then they incorrectly guessed that something 
was flowing out of the positive terminal and into the negative terminal. That is, they assumed the current flowed 
from positive to negative, as shown at the left in Figure 5.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-17  
This incorrect assumption causes a certain amount of confusion today. Many people still think of electricity as a 
"positive current." But most people think of it as the flow of electrons. In order to avoid confusion in these 
chapters, the term electric current will always mean the flow of electrons. 
5-18  
An electric current is defined as the amount of electrical charge moving past a given point in a unit of time. The 
amount of charge is measured in coulombs, and the time is measured in seconds. A rate of flow of one coulomb 
per second is called one ampere. 
 
 
Figure 5.1: Two Kinds of Electrical Current 
Positive Current Flow 
Electron Flow 

84 
 
Electric Current (continued) 
5-19  
It takes 6.28 x 10 18 (628 billion billion) electrons to make up a charge of one coulomb. Therefore, a current of one 
ampere consists of 6.28 x 10 18 electrons flowing past a given point in one second. The current through an ordinary 
100-watt light bulb is almost one ampere. The current through an industrial motor may be 100 amperes or more. 
5-20  
The rate that electrons move through a conductor is beyond the ability of the human mind to imagine it, even if 
the current is only one ampere. For example, suppose a conductor carries a current of one ampere. The number 
of electrons that pass a given point in this conductor in just one billionth of a second is greater than the total 
number of people living on the earth today. 
5-21  
Looking at this current another way, suppose you divide the distance around the earth, approximately 25,000 
miles, into one-inch parts, as shown in Figure 5.2. A current of one ampere, lasting for only one billionth of a 
second, would consist of four electrons for every inch in the earth's circumference. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Resistance 
5-22  
When any material flows through a pipe, it meets opposition. The opposition comes from friction between the 
material and the inner surface of the pipe. The friction resists the flow of the material, and it produces heat. 
5-23 
The same is true of electricity flowing in a conductor. The moving electrons meet opposition, and the opposition 
produces heat. This opposition is called the resistance of the conductor. 
5-24  
Resistance is a property of the material, its size, and its temperature. Some materials have a greater resistance to 
the flow of electricity than other materials of the same cross-sectional area and at the same temperature. For 
example, metals generally have lower resistance than nonmetals. For most conductors, increasing the cross-
sectional area decreases the resistance. Raising the temperature generally increases the resistance. 
Figure 5.2: Circumference of the Earth Equals 1.5 Billion Inches 

85 
 
Potential Difference 
5-25  
If electrons have greater potential energy at one place than at another, then a potential difference is said to exist 
between the two places. Potential difference is the difference in potential energy, per unit of charge, between 
two points. 
5-26  
In the metric system, potential energy is measured in joules. Charge is measured in coulombs. If the difference in 
potential energy between two places is one joule for every coulomb of charge, then there is a potential difference 
of one joule per coulomb. This amount of potential difference is called one volt. 
1 Volt = 
One Joule of Potential Energy
Coulomb of Charge
 
5-27  
Figure 5.3 shows the idea of a volt. Suppose you place a small electric heater in approximately one gram of water 
which occupies a volume of one cubic centimeter. Suppose further that the resistance of the heater allows current 
of one ampere to flow when the heater is connected to a one-volt cell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-28  
If you let the current flow for exactly one second, one coulomb of charge will flow through the heater. As it flows, 
the electrons will lose energy to the water through the heater. The temperature of the water will rise by slightly 
less than one-fourth of a degree Celsius. 
5-29  
In general, if a conductive path exists between any two points, charge will flow between the points as long as the 
potential difference exists. But the current reduces the charge at one point, and increases the charge at the other. 
The effect is to reduce the potential difference between the two places. 
 
 
Figure 5.3: Electricity Heating Water 

86 
 
Potential Difference 
5-30  
If the potential difference decreases to zero, the current stops. Therefore, to maintain a current between two 
points, you must maintain the potential difference as the charge flows. 
5-31  
A battery or generator acts like a "pump," moving electrons through itself to maintain a potential difference 
between two points. The electrical utility runs wires to your plant from its generators. The utility maintains a 
certain potential difference between these wires to keep the equipment running in the plant. 
5-32  
Potential difference can vary from zero to several million volts. The potential difference between the terminals 
of a dry cell is about 1.5 volts. The potential difference between the terminals of an automobile storage battery 
is about 12 volts. The potential differences commonly applied to the terminals of industrial electric motors are 
120, 200, 240, 480, 2400, and 4000 volts. 
 
Ohm's Law 
5-33  
There is a simple relationship between the current that flows through a conducting path and the potential 
difference between the ends of the path. As you increase the potential difference, the current increases, as shown 
in Figure 5.4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-34  
The two values are proportional. That is, doubling the potential difference doubles the current. Tripling the 
potential difference triples the current, and so on. This proportional relationship between potential difference 
and current is called Ohm's law in honor of George Ohm. He was a German scientist who discovered the 
relationship in the early 1800s. 
 
 
Figure 5.4: Effect of Potential Difference on Current 

87 
 
Ohm's Law (continued) 
5-35  
Ohm's law is usually expressed in mathematical form. The equation is written in the following way. 
             E = I x R 
Where E = Potential difference between the ends of the conductor 
             I = Current through the conductor 
            R = The constant of proportionality between E and I 
5-36  
The value R is called the resistance of the conductor. It is measured in units called ohms. One ohm is defined as 
the resistance of a conductor that carries a current of one ampere when the potential difference between its ends 
is one volt. 
5-37  
The Greek letter Ω (omega) is used as a symbol to stand for the unit ohms. For example, 40 Ω means a resistance 
of 40 ohms. When you write large or small values of resistance, you can use prefixes to simplify your writing. Table 
5-1 shows several examples using the common prefixes. 
 
Table 5-1:  Common Prefixes

1 µΩ    =  0.000001 ohms 
1 mΩ   =  0.001 ohms 
1 kΩ    =  1000 ohms 
1 MΩ  =  1,000,000 ohms 
 
5-38  
You can use Ohm's law to calculate the third value in the equation when you know any two values. For example, 
suppose you know that a conductor carries a current of 0.50 amperes when the potential difference between its 
ends is 25 volts. What will the current be if you raise the potential difference to 35 volts? 
5-39  
To answer this question, you can use Ohm's law in two steps. First you calculate the resistance of the conductor, 
using the current and potential difference given. Then you use that value of the resistance to calculate the current 
when the potential difference is raised to 35 volts. These calculations are shown in Figure 5.5. 
5-40  
Notice in Figure 5.5 that the units are included in the calculations. You should do the same when you solve 
problems. The equation is a physical equation. The letters stand for physical quantities, not just numbers. 
 
 
Figure 5.5: Using Ohm’s Law 

88 
 
Resistance and Voltage Drop 
5-41  
The potential difference from one end of a conductive path to the other depends on what the ends are connected 
to. But the potential difference between other pairs of points depends only partly on what the ends of the path 
are connected to. It also depends on the resistance between the points compared to the total resistance. 
5-42 
 An example will help you understand this point. Suppose a conductive path consists of three sections, each having 
a different resistance. These sections are connected in series or end-to-end as shown in Figure 5.6. All the current 
in the path flows through each resistor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-43  
Suppose the three sections have a combined resistance of 100 Ω. Suppose further that the potential difference 
between the ends of the path is 100 volts. Using Ohm's law, you can calculate that the current is one ampere. 
5-44  
If you measure the potential difference from one end of the path to various points between sections, you will find 
that the potential difference is lower than 100 volts. If your measuring instrument spans only one section, the 
potential difference is even less. And if it spans no sections, the potential difference is zero. 
5-45  
You can think of this reduction as a decrease in potential difference as you span less and less of the total path. The 
common name for this decrease in potential difference over the path is "voltage drop." 
5-46  
You can use Ohm's law to see why the potential difference decreases when you measure it across only part of the 
path. Each resistor carries the same amount of current as the whole path. Therefore, according to Ohm's law, the 
potential difference across each section equals the product of this current and the resistance of the section. 
5-47  
For example, the potential difference across section A in Figure 5.6 is 50 volts, because the current is one ampere 
(l ampere x 50 Ω = 50 volts). If you calculate the potential difference across all three sections, and add the three 
results together, the total will equal the potential difference across the total path. 
5-48  
The voltage drop is proportional to the amount of resistance in the span you are measuring. If half the total 
resistance is included in the span, the voltage drop is half the potential difference across the whole path. If 80 
percent of the total resistance is included, the voltage drop is 80 percent of the potential difference across the 
whole path. 
 
 
Figure 5.6: Voltage Drop 

89 
 
Measuring Current 
5-49  
On certain troubleshooting jobs, you will need to know how much current is flowing in part of a circuit. 
Measuring the current establishes part of the basis for analyzing the circuit, which can lead you to the cause of 
the problem. To measure the current, you use an ammeter. 
5-50  
Two basic kinds of meters are in common use. The simplest kind to read is the modern digital meter. It displays 
values as numerals. Figure 5.7 shows a digital meter. This instrument can measure current, resistance, and 
potential difference. You select the kind of measurement and the range by means of controls on the front of 
the instrument. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.7: Digital multimeter 

90 
 
Measuring Current (continued) 
5-51  
The older kind of meter has an electromechanical movement, called a D'Arsonval movement, that displays 
values. This movement works by making use of the relationship between electricity and magnetism. Figure 5.8 
shows the basic construction of the D'Arsonval movement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-52  
The movement is designed so that a small current flows through a coil of wire suspended in a strong magnetic 
field. The magnetic field exerts force on the electrons as they move through the coil. The force is in opposite 
directions in the two sides of the coil. Thus, the two forces, acting on opposite sides of the coil, produce the same 
twisting effect on the coil. 
5-53  
The coil is suspended so that it can rotate in response to the twisting effect of the magnetic field. But in order to 
rotate, the coil must partly wind up a small spring. The spring exerts another twisting effect on the coil. This effect 
opposes the twisting effect of the magnetic field. The more the coil rotates, the more it must wind up the spring, 
increasing the twisting effect of the spring. 
5-54  
The coil reaches a position where the twisting effect of the magnetic field exactly balances the twisting effect of 
the spring. This position serves as a measure of the amount of current flowing through the coil. 
5-55  
A pointer attached to the coil shows how far the coil has rotated in relation to a fixed scale. The scale can indicate 
current, resistance, or potential difference, depending on how the meter is connected to the circuit and to other 
devices inside. The scale can be calibrated in amperes, ohms, or volts. 
 
 
Figure 5.8: D’Arsonval movement 

91 
 
Measuring Current (continued) 
5-56  
In an ammeter, most of the current flowing through the meter goes around the meter movement. It goes through 
a special resistor, called the shunt, as shown in Figure 5.9. The resistance of the shunt is quite low. Yet it is precisely 
set, so that a known fraction of the current flows through the D'Arsonval movement. The accuracy of the shunt 
resistor determines the accuracy of the readings on the ammeter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-57  
The resistance of the shunt determines the sensitivity and the range of the ammeter. The higher the resistance of 
the shunt, the greater the fraction of the current that flows through the meter movement. Increasing this fraction 
increases the sensitivity of the meter and reduces the amount of current required to produce a full-scale deflection 
of the meter movement. 
5-58  
In most ammeters, you can turn a rotary switch to select any one of several shunts. In this way, you can choose 
the sensitivity and the range of the meter. 
5-59  
The meter used for measuring potential difference is called a voltmeter, because it measures potential difference 
in volts. A digital voltmeter displays the value as a numeral. A D'Arsonval voltmeter displays the value as the 
position of a pointer on a scale. 
 
 
Figure 5.9  Ammeter 

92 
 
Measuring Current (continued) 
5-60  
A D'Arsonval voltmeter is connected internally much like a D'Arsonval ammeter. But instead of a shunt to carry 
most of the current around the meter movement, it has a series resistor connected to the movement, as shown 
in Figure 5.10. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-61  
The series resistor has a very high resistance. Therefore, the amount of current flowing through the meter 
movement is very low. The value of the resistor determines the sensitivity and the range of the voltmeter. 
5-62 
The higher the resistance, the lower the current that flows through the meter movement for a given potential 
difference. Decreasing the current lowers the sensitivity of the meter and increases the potential difference 
required to produce a full-scale deflection of the meter movement. 
 
 
Figure 5.10: Voltmeter 

93 
 
Measuring Resistance 
5-63  
The instrument for measuring resistance is a combination of an electrical source (usually a dry cell) and an 
ammeter, as shown in Figure 5.11. The electrical source applies a known potential difference between two points 
in a circuit. The ammeter measures the amount of current produced by this potential difference. A special limiting 
resistor is included to protect the meter in case the resistance of the circuit is very low. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-64  
You can calculate the resistance of the circuit by dividing the potential difference by the current. But the meter 
solves this problem for you, and shows the result in ohms. A digital ohmmeter displays the result as a numeral. A 
D'Arsonval ohmmeter displays the result as the position of a pointer on a scale. The scale is usually "backward," 
with zero at the right.

Summary 
Electric current is the flow of electrons from a negative point to a positive point. The flow of electric current is 
measured in units called amperes. For current to now, a potential difference must exist between two points. 
Potential difference is measured in units called volts. 
Electrons flow very easily through some materials—metals and carbon, for example. Such materials are called 
conductors. Other materials—rubber, plastic, and glass, for example—inhibit the flow of electrons. Such materials are 
called insulators. Conducting and insulating materials are used in construction, equipment, and machines. 
When you work with electric current, you should remember Ohm's law. Simply put, it says the amount of current flow 
is proportionate to the amount of potential difference between the ends of the path. In other words, increasing or 
decreasing the potential difference increases or decreases the amount of current flowing along the path. 
You can use an instrument called an ammeter to measure electric current. A voltmeter is used in measuring potential 
difference.

When you work with electricity, it is important to know about the materials used in wiring, insulating, and other 
electrical components. Such materials are selected for their ability to conduct or resist the flow of electrons. 
Capacitors, inductors, solenoids, and relays are important electrical components. In this Lesson, we explain the uses of 
conducting and insulating materials in electrical components commonly used in plant equipment and machinery.

Resistance 
6-1  
Various materials have different atomic structures. The number of free electrons differs in each material. 
The more free electrons a material has, the easier it is for electric current to flow through it. The fewer free 
electrons, the more difficult it is for electricity to flow. 
6-2  
The opposition to electric current is called resistance. Resistance is a physical quantity—a property of a 
material. Materials that conduct electric current have definite values of resistance ranging from zero to very 
high values. The resistance also depends on the length, the cross-sectional area, and the temperature of the 
material. 
6-3  
Certain materials lose their electrical resistance completely at temperatures near absolute zero. These materials 
are called superconductors. If an electric current is started in a loop of wire made of superconducting material, 
the current will continue to flow even after the power source is removed. 
6-4  
An "ideal" conductor, used for carrying electricity from a power source to a load, should have no electrical 
resistance. However, the ideal conductor does not exist at ordinary temperatures. Therefore, electrical wires are 
made of materials having the lowest possible resistance at a reasonable cost. 
6-5  
Copper is the material used most often for electrical conductors. Where it is important to save weight, aluminum 
is used instead. Aluminum wiring is used in aircraft wiring and in long-distance power transmission lines that are 
suspended from towers. 
6-6  
In some applications, even the slight resistance of the wires connecting parts of a sensitive electronic circuit 
can affect the performance of the circuit. In such applications, silver wires keep the circuit resistance to a 
minimum. Silver has the lowest resistance of all metals at ordinary temperatures. 
6-7  
High resistance is needed for electric heating elements and for the filaments of light bulbs. These elements 
must have high resistance to control their temperature during use. 
6-8  
The heating element in an electric heater is usually made of high-resistance nichrome (nickel-chromium) 
wire. The cable supplying power to the heater is made of low-resistance copper wire. 
6-9  
The high-resistance wire becomes hot when electric current passes through it because of its high resistance. 
The copper wire remains cool because its resistance is much lower than that of the nichrome element. 
6-10  
Another purpose of high resistance is to limit the current in a circuit. All electrical equipment has some resistance, 
but sometimes resistance must be added to control the current. Most dc motors require extra resistance in the 
circuit during starting to prevent too much current from flowing through the motor windings. 
6-11  
The most effective method of controlling the current during starting is to add several units of resistance in series 
with the motor windings. These units are then gradually disconnected during the starting period until all the extra 
resistance has been removed. 
 
 

99 
 
Resistors 
6-12  
Components that add resistance to a circuit are called resistors. There are many types of resistors. Some have a 
fixed value of resistance, and others are variable. Many resistors are made of high-resistance wire wound around 
a ceramic form. Others are made of cast iron, punched steel sheet, or carbon. Resistors can differ in size and 
construction, even if their resistance values are the same. 
6-13  
Electricity flowing through a resistor produces heat. The rate of heat production is proportional to the product of 
the potential difference across the resistor and the current passing through it. That is, you multiply E x I for the 
resistor, and the product is a measure of how fast heat is produced. 
6-14  
For example, suppose you connect two resistors in two circuits so that the potential difference is the same across 
both resistors. Suppose further that one resistor has only half as much resistance as the other, and therefore 
carries twice the current. 
6-15  
The resistor that carries twice as much current will produce heat twice as fast. When you multiply the current 
times the potential difference for each resistor, you get a product twice as high for the resistor carrying twice the 
current. 
6-16  
But suppose you double the potential difference across the resistor in just one of these circuits. Doing so will 
multiply the rate of heat production in that resistor by four, not by two. The reason has to do with Ohm's law. 
Doubling the potential difference also doubles the current flowing through the resistor. Therefore, the product is 
multiplied by four. 
6-17 
Resistors that must carry high currents are physically large so the heat can be released quickly into the surrounding 
air. If a resistor does not get rid of its heat fast enough, the temperature can rise so high that it damages or even 
melts the resistor. 
 
 

100 
 
Fixed Resistors 
6-18 
The simplest kind of resistor is the fixed resistor.  It is a unit constructed so that its resistance value cannot be 
changed.  Some examples of fixed carbon resistors are shown in Figure 6.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-19  
The resistance of the resistor is determined by the composition of the material used in making it. Carbon is 
commonly used for resistors of low power rating. Resistors for high-power use are made of high-resistance wire 
wound on an insulated core. They are covered with a protective coating, as shown in Figure 6.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.1: Fixed Carbon Resistors 
Figure 6.2: Fixed Wire Wound Resistors 

101 
 
Fixed Resistors (continued) 
6-20  
Schematic symbols for fixed resistors are shown in Figure 6.3. The Joint Industrial Council (JIC) symbol for a resistor 
is a rectangle. A zigzag line is the symbol used on the diagrams in electronics. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-21  
Fixed resistors are marked to show the value of their resistance. Carbon resistors are generally quite small. They 
are marked by a special code, consisting of a system of colored rings. Larger wire-wound resistors have numbers 
stamped on them to show the value of their resistance in ohms. 
 
Resistor Color Code 
6-22 
The resistor color code is a system of bands painted around the body of a resistor.  To read the color code, you 
start with the band at the end and read toward the center of the resistor. The meanings of these bands are listed 
below. 
 
  
First band: 
First digit of the resistance value 
 
  
Second band: Second digit of the resistance value 
 
  
Third band: 
Multiplier or the number of zeros that follow the first two digits 
 
  
Fourth band: 
Tolerance in the resistance value 
 
6-23  
It is impossible to manufacture millions of resistors at low cost and have their resistance values all turn out 
identical. But the resistance values can be maintained within certain upper and lower limits. This tolerance may 
be wide or narrow, depending on the manufacturing methods. 
6-24  
If the fourth color band is missing, it means the measured value of the resistance is within 20 percent of the 
marked value. For example, a resistor marked 1000Ω would have a measured value of IOOOΩ ± 200Ω, which is 
800 - 1200Ω. 
Figure 6.3: Symbols for Resistors 

102 
 
Resistor Color Code (continued) 
6-25  
If the resistor has a fourth band that is silver, the tolerance is ten percent. A gold band indicates the tolerance is 
five percent. 
6-26 
Table 6-1 lists the color bands and their meaning.  You should memorize this table. To check your memory, figure 
out the resistance values of the resistors shown in figure 6.4. the first two examples have been done for you. 
6-27 
In the remaining four cases, figure out what each color band means and then write the resistance values in the 
spaces provided. Make sure you include the tolerance for each value. Then check your answers against the values 
provided on the following page.

Resistor Power Rating 
6-28  
When choosing a resistor for a given purpose, you must consider two factors. 
 
The required resistance 
 
The amount of power the resistor will be required to carry 
6-29 
The current passing through a resistor produces heat. The rate at which heat is produced depends on the current 
and on the potential difference across the resistor. The higher the product of these two values, the faster heat is 
produced. The rate of heat production is called power. It is measured in watts. 
6-30 
Typical power ratings for carbon resistors are ¼ watt, ½ watt, 1 watt, and 2 watts. The greater the power rating, 
the larger the size of the resistor, as shown in Figure 6.1 on page 100. 
6-31 
Resistors in motor circuits carry large currents, especially during starting. The high current produces heat at a very 
high rate. The power rating of such a resistor must therefore be quite high— 1000 watts or more. 
6-32 
These high-power resistors are made of cast iron or punched steel sheets. They are sometimes called grids, 
because of the way they are assembled. Grid-type resistors are used in controlling the speed of large dc motors. 
An example of this type of resistor is shown in Figure 6.5.

6-33 
Grid-resistor elements are made of cast iron or a similar alloy of uniform thickness. Individual elements are 
assembled on metal tie rods. The elements are insulated from the tie rods by mica. The grids are securely 
supported for protection against mechanical stresses. 
6-34 
Grid sections are connected to form an electrical path. The grid construction also serves to dissipate heat very 
efficiently. These resistors usually have low resistance and carry high currents. They sometimes become red hot 
in operation. 
 
Tapped Resistors 
6-35  
Fixed resistors sometimes have one or more connections, called taps, between the ends of the resistance 
material. Most tapped resistors consist of resistance wire wrapped around a ceramic core. There is a separate 
terminal attached to the resistance wire for each tap. 
6-36  
On some units, a section of the resistance wire is exposed all along one side of the resistor. A sliding lug can be 
set to make contact with the wire at any of the exposed points. Figure 6.6 shows several sizes of these adjustable 
tapped resistors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-37  
Figure 6.6 also shows the symbols for tapped resistors. The zigzag line appears mostly on the schematics for 
electronic equipment. The rectangle is the standard JIC symbol used on machine tool wiring diagrams.

Variable Resistors 
6-38  
Often it is necessary to be able to vary the resistance in an electrical circuit in order to get the desired output from 
the equipment. Variable resistors have a movable contact mounted on a shaft, a slide, or some other control 
mechanism. You can operate the mechanism to vary the resistance of the device. 
6-39  
The volume control on a radio and a variable-speed control on a portable electric drill are common examples of 
variable resistors. The volume control is called a potentiometer, or sometimes simply a "pot." The variable resistor 
in the speed control of the drill is called a rheostat. 
6-40  
Potentiometers and rheostats are similar in construction. The resistance element is usually arranged in a circular 
arc, making a circular component like the ones shown in Figure 6.7. But sometimes the resistance element is in a 
straight line. A sliding contact changes the resistance between the contact and the end of the element. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-41  
Rheostats are usually wire-wound. Potentiometers can have either wire or carbon resistive elements. Both devices 
have three terminals. One at each end of the resistance element, and one for the sliding contact. The two devices 
differ in their resistance and in the way they are connected in a circuit. 
 
 
Figure 6.7: Potentiometers 

106 
 
Variable Resistors (continued) 
6-42 
A potentiometer has high resistance. Usually on the order of 10,000 - 50,000Ω. A rheostat has much lower 
resistance.  The potentiometer is usually quite small.  About as big as a quarter or a half-dollar. You can easily hold 
one in the palm of your hand. A rheostat may be quite large, as shown in Figure 6.8. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-43  
A potentiometer conducts very little current. Its purpose is to divide a fixed potential difference into two parts. 
The fixed potential difference is applied across the end-terminals of the device. As you move the sliding contact, 
the potential difference increases between one end-terminal and the sliding contact. It decreases between the 
other end-terminal and the contact. 
6-44  
The purpose of a rheostat is to vary the amount of current passing through it. Normally, one end-terminal is left 
unconnected. When you adjust the rheostat, you vary the resistance between the sliding contact and the other 
and terminal. Therefore, you vary the amount of current passing through the rheostat. 
Figure 6.8: Rheostat 

107 
 
Variable Resistors (continued) 
6-45  
Potentiometers and rheostats are rated according to the amount of power they can handle. Potentiometers with 
carbon resistive elements have power ratings of ½ - 2 watts. Rheostats with wire-wound resistive elements can 
handle power in the range of 5 - 1000 watts. 
 
Capacitors 
6-46  
A capacitor is a device that can store electrical charge. It is also sometimes called a condenser. It consists of two 
conducting surfaces separated by insulation. The insulation is called a dielectric. Figure 6.9 shows the basic 
construction of a capacitor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-47  
When connected to a battery or to another dc source, one conducting surface acquires a positive charge, and the 
other acquires an equal negative charge. The dc source acts like an "electron pump." It removes electrons from 
one surface, giving it a positive charge. It delivers an equal number of electrons to the other surface, giving it a 
negative charge. The electrons cannot flow from one surface to the other inside the capacitor, because the 
dielectric will not conduct them. 
6-48  
When the switch is first closed, there is a momentary surge of electrons flowing off the positive plate. There is an 
equal surge of electrons flowing onto the negative plate. An ammeter shows that current flows immediately after 
the switch is closed, and then decreases to zero. 
6-49  
When a capacitor begins charging, it behaves as though the electrical path were complete inside. But when the 
potential difference between the terminals of the capacitor equals the potential difference between the terminals 
of the dc source, the current stops. At this point, no more current can flow to or from the capacitor. 
Figure 6.9: Basic Construction of a Capacitor 

108 
 
Capacitors (continued) 
6-50  
After the terminals of the capacitor are disconnected from the dc source, the charge may remain on the two 
conducting surfaces for several minutes, an hour, or even longer. 
6-51  
If you are working on a machine that includes a capacitor charged at a high potential difference, you may be in 
danger of receiving a serious electric shock from it. You can discharge the capacitor by shorting the terminals with 
an insulated wire or with a screwdriver with an insulated handle. Electrons will then flow from one surface to the 
other until both surfaces are electrically neutral. 
 
Capacitance 
6-52  
Just as resistance is the ability of a resistor to resist the flow of electric current, capacitance is the ability of a 
capacitor to store electric charge. Capacitance is the amount of charge a capacitor can store compared to the 
potential difference between its terminals. 
6-53  
In order to calculate capacitance, you divide the stored charge (measured in coulombs) by the potential difference 
between the terminals (measured in volts). A capacitance of one coulomb per volt is called one farad, abbreviated 
F. This unit is named for Michael Faraday, an English scientist who made important discoveries about the nature 
of electricity during the 1800s. 
6-54  
The farad is too large a unit for practical applications. A smaller unit, the microfarad, is used in measuring 
capacitance in both electrical and electronics applications. The prefix micro- means one-millionth. A microfarad is 
one-millionth of a farad. It is abbreviated µF. 
6-55 
The micro-microfarad, also called the picofarad, is a smaller unit used mostly in electronics. A picofarad is one-
millionth of a microfarad. It is abbreviated pF or µµF. 
6-56 
Capacitance is determined by the area of the conductive surfaces inside the capacitor and by the spacing between 
the surfaces. The larger the area of the surfaces, and the closer together they are, the higher the capacitance. 
6-57  
Capacitance also depends on what kind of dielectric material is placed between the conducting surfaces. The 
capacitance is lowest when the dielectric is air. Substituting other insulating materials for air greatly increases the 
capacitance. 
6-58  
The ratio of capacitance with a given dielectric material to the capacitance of the same capacitor with air as the 
dielectric is called the dielectric constant of the given material. The dielectric constant of air is one, because of 
this definition. If the air in a capacitor is replaced by a sheet of glass, the capacitance is multiplied by 7.5. 
Therefore, the dielectric constant of glass is said to be 7.5. 
 
 

109 
 
Types of Capacitors 
6-59  
Capacitors used in electrical and electronic circuits differ considerably in physical size, construction, and 
capacitance. Several common shapes are shown in Figure 6.10. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-60  
A fixed capacitor has a constant value of capacitance. It may be made of metal plates separated by air, but most 
fixed capacitors are made of metal foil separated by a solid or liquid dielectric. With this "sandwich" construction, 
a high capacitance can be obtained in a small unit. The most commonly-used solid dielectrics are paper, ceramic, 
mica, and plastic. The liquid dielectric is either mineral oil or a synthetic material. 
6-61 
An electrolytic capacitor has plates made of aluminum foil, and a moist, conducting chemical paste between them. 
The dielectric is a thin film that forms on one plate when a potential difference is applied across the plates. The 
capacitance of an electrolytic capacitor is very high for a given plate area. 
6-62  
A variable capacitor is usually made with air as the dielectric. One set of metal plates, called the rotor, can rotate 
on a shaft. The plates of the rotor mesh with a set of stationary plates, called the stator. The capacitance is 
varied by turning the rotor to vary the overlap of the plates on the rotor and stator. 
 
 
Figure 6.10: Common Capacitor Types 

110 
 
Types of Capacitors (continued) 
6-63  
Two variable capacitors are often mounted on the same structure so that they will always work together. This 
device is called a ganged variable capacitor. The symbols for single and ganged variable capacitors are shown in 
Fig. 6.11. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-64  
When a potential difference is applied across the plates of a capacitor, the plates apply compression forces to 
the dielectric. These forces come from the attraction between the oppositely charged plates. 
6-65  
If the potential difference between the plates gets too high, electrons can "punch through" the dielectric, 
breaking it down and providing a path for electrons to flow easily between the plates. This path remains even 
after the potential difference is reduced to its normal level. The capacitor is therefore permanently damaged. 
The potential difference required for this kind of breakdown is called the breakdown voltage. 
6-66  
The maximum potential difference that can be applied to a capacitor without damaging it is usually printed on the 
capacitor. Exceeding this value can destroy the capacitor. Once dielectric breakdown occurs, most capacitors are 
useless. However, some electrolytic capacitors can "heal" themselves if the breakdown is not severe. The 
electrolytic reforms the damaged insulation. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.11: Variable Capacitors 

111 
 
Connecting Capacitors 
6-67 
 Capacitors are connected in a circuit either in parallel or in series. 
 
When capacitors are connected in parallel, as shown at the left in Figure 6.12, their combined capacitance 
equals the sum of the capacitances of all the individual capacitors. 
 
When capacitors are connected in series, as shown at the right in Figure 6.12, their combined capacitance is 
less than that of the lowest-value capacitor in the group. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-68 
Capacitors are connected in parallel to achieve higher capacitance than is available in one unit. The potential 
difference applied to a group must not exceed the lowest breakdown voltage for all the capacitors in the group. 
6-69 
For example, suppose three capacitors are connected in parallel. Two have a breakdown voltage of 450 volts, and 
one has a breakdown voltage of 300 volts. The maximum potential difference you can apply to the group without 
damaging any capacitor is 300 volts. 
6-70 
One reason capacitors are connected in series is to reduce the total capacitance in the circuit. Another reason is 
that two or more capacitors in series can withstand a higher potential difference than any individual capacitor can 
withstand. 
6-71 
For example, two identical capacitors with breakdown voltages of 450 volts can withstand up to 900 volts when 
they are connected in series. In this case, the potential difference is divided equally because the capacitances are 
equal. 
6-72 
The potential difference does not divide equally if the capacitances are unequal. If the capacitances are unequal, 
you must be careful not to exceed the breakdown voltage of any capacitor. 
 
 
Figure 6.12: Connecting Capacitors 

112 
 
Induction 
6-73 
Induction is a magnetic effect that occurs when the current changes in a coil of wire. The changing current 
produces a changing magnetic field around the coil. The changing magnetic field opposes the change in the 
current. 
6-74 
The coil acts like a resistor while the magnetic field is building up. When the magnetic field is disappearing, the 
coil acts like a power source. While the current remains steady, the coil does not interfere with the flow of 
electricity. It affects the current only while the magnetic field is changing. 
6-75 
The magnetic field does not appear instantly when current starts flowing in the coil. It takes time to build up. 
Likewise, when the current stops, the field does not disappear instantly. It takes a certain amount of time to 
disappear. 
6-76 
As the field disappears, it develops a potential difference between the ends of the coil. If the field disappears very 
rapidly, this potential difference may be very high—high enough to cause a large spark in the coil or in the switch 
controlling the current. As soon as the field disappears, this potential difference disappears. 
 
Mutual Induction 
6-77  
The magnetic field produced by one coil or conductor can create a current or a potential difference in another coil 
or conductor. This effect is called mutual induction. The direction of the current in the second coil is opposite the 
direction of the current in the first coil. 
6-78  
Figure 6.13 shows a simple example of mutual induction. A loop of wire is connected to battery through a switch. 
While the switch is open, no current flows in the loop, and there is no magnetic field. When the switch closes, the 
loop begins to carry a current, and this current creates a magnetic field. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.13: Mutual Induction 

113 
 
Mutual Induction (continued) 
6-79  
As the magnetic field builds up, its strength changes from zero to a maximum value. This changing field produces 
a current in the lowest loop. If the lower loop were not closed, the magnetic field would produce a potential 
difference between the ends of the wire. After the magnetic field reaches its maximum value, it no longer 
produces either a current or a potential difference in the lower loop. 
6-80  
When the switch in the circuit of Figure 6.13 is opened, current stops flowing in the upper loop. The magnetic 
field then changes in strength from its maximum value to zero. This change produces the reverse effects in the 
lower loop. 
 
Inductance 
6-81  
The measurement of induction is called inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named for the American 
scientist Joseph Henry. Henry made electrical discoveries similar to those of Faraday in England at almost the 
same time. One henry is defined as the inductance that produces a potential difference of one volt in an open 
circuit when the current changes in the other circuit at the rate of one ampere per second. The symbol for the 
henry is H. 
6-82  
The henry is too large a unit for measuring inductance in most circuits. Smaller units are usually used instead, 
especially the millihenry (mH, one thousandth of a henry) and the microhenry (µH, one millionth of a henry). 
6-83  
Inductance is not as important in dc circuits as it is in ac circuits. A coil in a dc circuit opposes current flow only 
when the current changes. For example, when it starts flowing and when it stops flowing. In an AC circuit, the 
current is continually changing. Therefore, the coil opposes the flow of current continually. 
6-84  
A coil or a capacitor in an ac circuit acts like a resistor, but without producing the heat a resistor would produce. 
This kind of opposition to the flow of alternating current is called reactance. When caused by a capacitor, it is 
called capacitive reactance. When caused by a coil, it is called inductive reactance. 
6-85  
The unit for measuring reactance is the same as the unit for resistance, the ohm. But reactance cannot be 
measured with an ohmmeter, because the ohmmeter applies direct current to the circuit rather than alternating 
current. Therefore, capacitors and coils do not resist the current, except when you first connect the ohmmeter.  
 
 

114 
 
Inductors 
6-86  
An inductor is an electrical component that opposes any change in the current flowing in a circuit. The inductor 
resists the current when the current increases, and it aids the current when the current decreases. 
6-87  
An inductor is made by winding wire around a "core." The core may be made of either a magnetic material or a 
nonmagnetic material. Most conductors have cores of iron, but some have an "air core." The wire in an air core 
inductor is wound around a tube of paper or plastic. Figure 6.14 shows both kinds of inductors and their symbols. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-88  
An inductor is often called a choke or a coil. The name "choke" is based on the specific effect of the inductor in 
certain circuits. The name "coil" comes from the construction of the conductor.

Solenoids and Relays 
6-89  
Solenoids and relays are electromagnetic coils used as transducers. A transducer is a device that uses one kind of 
effect to produce another kind of effect. For example, the solenoid uses an electromagnetic effect to produce a 
mechanical effect. 
6-90  
A solenoid is a coil of wire with a movable magnetic core. When current flows through the coil, the magnetic field 
pulls the core into the coil. When the current stops, a spring pulls the core back out of the coil. The core can 
operate a valve or some other mechanical device. 
6-91  
A relay is a switch that operates by electricity. It consists of a magnetic armature mounted over the core of an 
electromagnet, as shown in Figure 6.15. When current flows through the electromagnet, it pulls the armature 
down, opening the normally-closed (NC) contacts and closing the normally-open (NO) contacts. When the 
current stops flowing through the coil, a spring returns the armature to its original position. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6-92  
A relay can provide switching control for machinery and other equipment from a remote location. The relay 
provides safety for the operator, because it usually operates at a low potential difference. For example, a relay 
coil operating on 6 volts can control a 240-volt motor.

Summary 
The ease or difficulty with which electric current flows is determined by the number of free electrons in the 
material the current must flow through. Materials having few free electrons are called resistors. Materials with 
many free electrons are called conductors. 
The simplest type of resistor is the fixed resistor. Its resistance value cannot be changed. Variable resistors allow 
the resistance value to change as needed. 
A capacitor is an electrical component that can store a charge. The ability to store a charge is called capacitance. 
Capacitance is measured in units called farads. Types of capacitors include fixed, electrolytic, and variable. 
When the current changes in a coil of wire, a magnetic effect called induction is produced. The measurement of 
induction is called inductance, and is measured in units called henrys. 
Other components that alter electric current include solenoids and relays. They are devices that use one kind of effect 
to produce another kind of effect.

All electrical devices are made up of materials that conduct and resist the flow of electrons. The trainee must be familiar 
with these materials. 
When you work with conductors, you must know how to determine conductor size. In this Lesson, we explain the basic 
units of conductor measurement. 
Electrical devices are often insulated with tape. You should be familiar with the different tapes and their uses. 
You may need to protect the conductors in your plant. This Lesson explains how to do so as well as the materials and 
tools to use. It also describes special tools used in stripping insulation, and explains how to splice wires.

Conductor and Insulators 
7-1  
A material that contains many free electrons is capable of carrying an electric current and is called a conductor. 
Free electrons are electrons that are not tightly bound to the atoms of the material. These electrons make up the 
electric current in metal wires, transistors, microprocessors, and all other kinds of devices that depend on the 
flow of electricity. 
7-2  
Some materials are better conductors of electricity than others. The more free electrons a material has, the better 
it will conduct. In good conductors, there is a weak attraction between the positive charge of the nucleus in each 
atom and the negative charge of the outer electrons surrounding the nucleus. Silver, copper, aluminum, and most 
other metals are good conductors, because they contain many free electrons. 
7-3  
A material that has only a few free electrons is called an insulator. In an insulator, there is a strong attraction 
between the positive charge of the nucleus and the negative charge of the outer electrons. Wood, rubber, 
porcelain, clay, and other nonmetallic materials are good insulators, because they have very few free electrons. 
7-4  
Materials that conduct electricity easily such as copper or aluminum, make up the main conducting parts of 
electrical equipment. But the equipment requires nonconducting materials as well. These nonconducting 
materials are called dielectrics as well as insulators. 
7-5  
Dielectrics prevent electricity from flowing where it should not flow. In this way, they help ensure the proper 
operation of electrical circuits, and they minimize the electrical hazards of motors and other equipment. 
 
Conductors 
7-6  
The use of conductors and their insulation is regulated mainly by the National Electrical Code (NEC). The NEC 
consists of a book of regulations listing the minimum safety precautions needed to safeguard people, buildings, 
and materials from the hazards of using electricity. 
7-7  
The NEC covers the electrical conductors and equipment serving public and private buildings and industrial plants. 
It also covers the conductors that connect buildings and equipment to a source of electricity. Installing and 
maintaining equipment in compliance with the NEC will result in installations that are generally free of electrical 
hazards. 
 
 

121 
 
Conductors (continued) 
7-8  
Wires and cables are the most common forms of conductors. They carry electric current through all kinds of 
circuits and systems. Wires and cables are made in a wide variety of forms suited to many different applications. 
Figure 7.1 shows some of the differences among wires and cables. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-9  
Conductors form an unbroken line carrying electricity from the generating plant to the point where it is used. The 
conductors are usually copper. The NEC defines a conductor as "a wire or cable or other form of metal suitable for 
carrying current." 
7-10  
All wires are conductors, but not all conductors are wires. Copper busbars, for example, are conductors but not 
wires. They are rigid rectangular bars rather than flexible wires. 
7-11  
The current passing through a conductor generates heat. The rate at which heat is generated depends on the 
amount of current in the conductor and on the potential difference between its ends. To calculate the rate of heat 
production (in watts), you multiply the current (in amperes) by the potential difference (in volts). 
7-12  
The potential difference in turn depends on the current through the conductor and on the resistance from end to 
end. The greater the resistance, the greater the potential difference and the faster heat is produced. The rate of 
heat production in the conductor equals the amount of power lost by the electricity in passing through the 
conductor. 
7-13  
A conductor must have a large enough cross-sectional area to give it a low resistance. But the cross-sectional area 
must also be small enough to keep the cost and the weight of the conductor as low as possible. For every 
conductor, there is a balance point between these two opposing goals. 
7-14  
The best cross-sectional area depends in part on how much current the conductor must carry. If it must carry a 
large current, the resistance must be small in order to keep the potential difference and the power loss as small 
as possible. If the current is small, the resistance can be higher without increasing the potential difference or the 
loss in power. 
 
 
Figure 7.1: Wires and Cables 

122 
 
Conductors (continued) 
7-15  
Every electrical device operates most efficiently when the potential difference between its terminals is the 
amount the device was designed for. For example, if an electric motor runs on a potential difference below its 
design rating, its efficiency drops. 
7-16  
The rate of heat production in a conductor increases with the square of the current. As heat is produced, the 
conductor gets hotter. As it does so, it releases heat to the surroundings at a faster rate. 
7-17  
The temperature rises until the rate at which the conductor releases heat to the surroundings matches the rate 
at which heat is produced within the conductor. The temperature of the conductor then remains steady. This 
steady temperature is called the equilibrium temperature. 
7-18  
There is a limit to the temperature each kind of insulation can safely withstand. There is also a limit to the 
temperature the surroundings can withstand. Even a bare wire must not be allowed to get hot enough to cause a 
fire in the surrounding materials. The NEC specifies the maximum current considered safe for conductors of 
different sizes, having different insulations, and installed in different surroundings. 
 
Conductor Sizes 
7-19  
To understand the different sizes of conductors, you must first understand the system for numbering these sizes. 
The basic unit is the mil. A mil is one thousandth (0.001) of an inch. A circular mil (abbreviated cir mil) is the area 
of a circle one mil in diameter. 
7-20  
For example, a wire measuring one mill (0.001 in.) in diameter has a cross-sectional area of one circular mil. The 
drawing on the left in Figure 7.2 shows the relationship between a mil and a circular mil. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-21  
The circular mil is the standard unit of wire cross-sectional area used in American and English wire tables. The 
diameter of a round wire is only a small fraction of an inch. By expressing these diameters in mils, you can avoid 
using decimals. 
1 mil 
1 mil 
1 mil 
1 mil 
Figure 7.2: Conductor Measurements 

123 
 
Conductor Sizes (continued) 
7-22  
For example, the diameter of a wire can be expressed as 25 mils instead of 0.025 in. The cross-sectional area in 
circular mils of a round conductor equals the square of the diameter measured in mils. Thus a wire with a diameter 
of 25 mils has a cross-sectional area of 625 cir mil, because 25 x 25 = 625. 
7-23  
The square mil (abbreviated sq mil) is a convenient unit for measuring the cross-sectional area of square and 
rectangular conductors. A square mil is defined as the area of a square measuring one mil on each side. The 
drawing at the right in Figure 7.2 shows the relationship between a mil and a square mil. 
7-24  
To calculate a cross-sectional area in square mils, you multiply the height by the width—both measured in mils. 
For example, suppose a rectangular busbar measures 3/8 inch by 4 inch. In decimal form, the thickness is 0.375 
in. or 375 mils. The width of 4 in. equals 4000 mils. Therefore, the area is 1,500,000 sq mil, because 375 x 4000 = 
1,500,000. 
7-25  
The resistance of a material increases as the length of the conductor increases. The resistance decreases as the 
cross-sectional area of the conductor increases. You can compare a material to others by measuring the resistance 
of a sample, multiplying by the cross-sectional area, and dividing by the length of the conductor. The result is 
called the resistivity of the material. 
 
Resistivity  = 
   
7-26  
You can measure the resistance in ohms, the cross-sectional area in sq mils or cir mils, and the length in feet. Then 
the resistivity is in ohms sq mils per foot, or in ohms cir mils per foot. 
7-27  
A common measure of wire diameter is the gauge number. The gauge commonly used in the United States is the 
American wire gauge (abbreviated AWG). Two typical AWG wire gauges are shown in Figure 7.3. The gauge at the 
left measures wires ranging in diameter from No. 30 (the smallest) to No. O (the largest). The gauge at the right 
measures sizes 15-0000.

Conductor Sizes (continued) 
7-28 
To measure the size of a wire with a wire gauge, you fit the bare wire into the smallest opening that will accept 
it. The number corresponding to that slot tells you the size of the wire. 
 
Conductor Classification 
7-29  
Wires and cables can be classified according to the kind of covering they have. 
 
Bare conductors have no covering. The most common use of bare conductors is in high voltage electrical 
transmission lines suspended from towers. 
 
 
Covered conductors are not insulated. However, they have a covering that provides protection against the 
weather and against heat from the surroundings. Covered conductors are used for outdoor low-voltage 
overhead circuits and for exposed interior wiring. 
 
 
Insulated conductors have a coating of insulation over the metal. The insulation separates the conductor 
electrically from other conductors and from the surroundings. It allows conductors to be grouped without 
danger. Additional covering over the insulation adds mechanical strength plus protection against weather, 
moisture, and abrasion. 
 
 
Stranded conductors consist of many strands of fine wire, as shown in Figure 7.4. The wires in a stranded 
conductor are usually twisted together. 
 
 
Cable consists of two or more conductors inside a single covering. The conductors in the cable may be either 
bare or insulated. The term "cable" is a general term for any conductor consisting of two or more conductors. 
In practice, it refers only to large conductors. A small cable is called a cord.

Insulation Properties 
7-30 
Two fundamental properties of insulation materials are called insulation resistance and dielectric strength. They 
are entirely different from each other, and they are measured in different ways. 
7-31 
Insulation resistance is the electrical resistance of the insulation against the flow of current. The instrument used 
for measuring insulation resistance is the megohmmeter. It measures high resistance values (in millions of ohms, 
called megohms), and it does not damage the insulation in making the measurement. 
7-32 
To understand the measurement of insulation resistance you need to know only one basic relationship—Ohm's 
law. Understanding the meaning of this law will help you in all kinds of electrical work. The equation expressing 
Ohm's law is very simple. 
 
 
E  =  I  x  R 
 where E  =  Potential difference across a conductor, measured in volts 
    I  =  Current through the conductor, measured in amperes 
   R  =  Resistance of the conductor, measured in ohms 
7-33 
The measurement of insulation resistance serves as a guide in evaluating the condition of insulation. However, it 
may not give a complete picture of the condition of the insulation. Clean, dry insulation may have a high insulation 
resistance, even if it is cracked and has other faults. Insulation in this condition is not safe to use, because the 
conductor is exposed wherever there are gaps in the insulation. 
7-34 
Dielectric strength is a measure of how much potential difference the insulation layer can withstand without 
breaking down. If the potential difference gets high enough, any insulation will fail suddenly and allow a large 
current to flow. The potential difference that causes breakdown is called the breakdown voltage of the insulation. 
7-35 
Every electrical device, whether it is a motor, generator, cable, switch, or transformer, is protected by some kind 
of electrical insulation. The insulation should be in good condition. Current must not leak through it slowly, and 
the material must not suddenly break down and allow a large current to flow. 
7-36 
With few exceptions, wires and cables used in all interior electrical systems are insulated. The insulating material 
varies in composition, form, and thickness, according to the needs of each application. The desirable 
characteristics of electrical insulation include the following. 
 
High dielectric strength 
 
Temperature resistance 
 
Flexibility 
 
Mechanical strength 
 
Moisture resistance 
 
7-37 
No single insulating material has all the characteristics required for every application. Therefore, many different 
kinds of insulating materials have been developed. Engineers can select the best combination of materials to 
provide the proper protection under various conditions of service. 
 
 

127 
 
Insulating Tapes 
7-38 
Various tapes are used for insulating electrical equipment, conductors, and components. Some of these tapes 
are adhesive. The tapes commonly used include friction, rubber, and plastic tape. 
7-39 
Rubber tape is made for insulating electrical splices. The tape is applied to the splice under slight tension, so 
that each layer presses tightly against the one underneath. The pressure causes the layers to bond together in 
a solid mass. 
7-40 
Applying rubber tape to a splice restores the insulation that was removed. But the outer protective 
covering must be restored with friction tape applied over the rubber tape. Friction tape consists of 
cotton cloth impregnated with an adhesive. It does not stretch like rubber tape does, and it does not 
have the insulating qualities of rubber tape. For these reasons, friction tape should not be used alone for 
insulation. 
7-41 
Plastic electrical tape is being used more than rubber or friction tape today. The plastic has several advantages 
over the materials used in other tapes. 
 
It has high dielectric strength. It can withstand several thousand volts without breaking down. 
 
It is very thin compared to rubber tape and friction tape. Extra layers add extra protection, but add very little 
to the size of the splice. 
 
It can stretch, so it easily conforms to the contour of the splice. 
7-42  
Varnished-cambric tape is also commonly used in electrical work. This tape is made of cloth impregnated with 
varnish. It usually has no adhesive coating. The tape is manufactured in sheets and in rolls. 
7-43  
Varnished-cambric tape is ideal for use on motor connections. Motor leads are disconnected more often than any 
other kind of electrical connection, because motors burn out, need repair, or are moved more frequently. 
7-44  
Removing rubber or plastic tape from a motor lead is difficult and time-consuming, because heat from the motor 
often fuses the tape onto the lead. To eliminate this problem, the motor lead connection is first wrapped with 
varnished-cambric tape. Then it is wrapped with plastic or friction tape. The varnished-cambric tape does not stick 
to the lead. You remove it simply by cutting through the layers and laying the tape open. 
 
 

128 
 
Protecting Conductors 
7-45  
Conductors are often installed in places where they need protection from damage. The kind and amount of 
protection required depends on how and where they are installed, and on how they are used. 
7-46  
Cables buried in the ground must resist moisture, chemical action, and abrasion. Abrasion is caused by movement 
of stones, gravel, or other rough materials against the cable. 
7-47 
Conductors installed in buildings must be protected against mechanical damage as the building is used. 
Conductors strung on cross arms of poles must have a high tensile strength. They must also be supported well in 
order to withstand the forces of heavy ice and snow, and of strong winds. 
7-48  
The best way to protect electrical conductors from physical damage is to enclose them in a solid protective 
channel. Such a channel is called a raceway. The NEC defines a raceway as any enclosed channel designed 
specifically for holding wires, cables, or busbars. A raceway can be made of metal or of an insulating material. It 
serves several purposes. 
 
It prevents mechanical damage to the wiring. 
 
It protects the wiring against harmful chemicals, vapors, and other materials. 
 
It protects people and property from the hazards  
7-49  
The most familiar raceway used in industrial plants is rigid metal conduit. This kind of conduit provides excellent 
physical protection for conductors. It also serves as an effective electrical ground for equipment. 
7-50  
Rigid conduit is a standard type of protection for wiring. It can be used in many different kinds of situations. It is 
used for concealed wiring in frame buildings and in solid masonry buildings. It provides good protection to 
exposed wiring subject to damage in hazardous locations. 
7-51  
Rigid conduit is steel pipe that encloses all wires. Conduit differs in several ways from the pipe used for carrying 
water, gas, and other materials. 
 
It is annealed to permit easy bending. 
 
The inside surface is prepared so the wires can be pulled into it with minimum effort and without damaging 
the insulation. 
 
It has a corrosion-resistant finish, usually galvanized, so the installation can be permanent without special 
care. 
7-52  
All conduit sizes have the same standard dimensions as the corresponding sizes of steel pipe. The range of external 
sizes is ½ to 6 inches.  Conduit is sold in 10-foot lengths, which are threaded on both ends. A threaded coupling is 
furnished with each 10-foot length. 
7-53  
Elbows are made for all diameters of rigid conduit, but most electricians bend the conduit on the job. Small 
diameters are bent with hand benders and "hickeys." Large diameters are bent with hydraulic machines. Rigid 
conduit is fastened to junction boxes with locknuts and end-bushings. 
 
 

129 
 
Protecting Conductors 
7-54  
Junction boxes protect wire splices. They are used wherever connections are made to electrical devices. There is 
little danger of overheating in continuous conductors, but poorly-made splices can cause short circuits, grounds, 
or overheating. To prevent fires, splices should always be enclosed in a metal junction box. The box also provides 
ground continuity. 
7-55  
Another kind of conduit is electrical metallic tubing, abbreviated as EMT. This conduit is made of thin-walled, 
semi-rigid metal. The walls are thinner than rigid conduit. The difference is shown in Figure 7.5. EMT has no 
threads, it is light in weight and easy to handle, and it can be used for both exposed and concealed wiring. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-56  
EMT is not as strong as rigid conduit, and it does not protect wiring as well against mechanical damage or 
corrosion. Couplings are used in joining lengths of EMT. Connectors secure EMT to junction boxes. The smallest 
trade size of EMT is ½ inch internal diameter and the largest is 4 inches. 
7-57  
EMT is easy to bend with an EMT bender, as shown in Figure 7.6. Using this type of bender, you can make bends 
and offsets to fit the contours of the building when installing EMT. However, elbows are also available. They are 
especially useful for installing large-diameter EMT.

Flexible Conduit 
7-58  
Flexible conduit, often called Greenfield conduit, is used where it is not practical to install either rigid conduit or 
EMT. This conduit is made of a single strip of galvanized steel. The strip is wound in a spiral upon itself, and 
interlocked to provide strength and flexibility. Figure 7.7 shows this kind of conduit. Flexible conduit is available 
in continuous lengths of up to 250 feet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-59  
Flexible metal conduit is better than rigid conduit for runs through spaces that contain obstructions or that require 
many bends. It is also commonly used instead of rigid conduit for connecting the wiring leading to motors or other 
vibrating machinery. Flexible conduit absorbs vibrations which would cause noise and also possibly loosen rigid 
conduit. Flexible conduit also makes it easier to shift a motor slightly. 
7-60  
Flexible conduit is recommended for temporary wiring where local codes require wiring to be enclosed in metal 
conduit. It can be used for most locations, except where conditions are wet and hazardous, or would cause 
deterioration of the conductor insulation. 
7-61  
Liquid-tight, flexible metal conduit, often called by its trade name, Sealtight™, is suitable where oil, water, certain 
chemicals, and corrosive gases might be present. This conduit has an outer liquid-tight jacket over the flexible 
armor. It requires special compression connectors to join it to other conduit or to a junction box. 
7-62  
Armored cable, generally known as BX, consists of insulated wire inside a flexible conduit. The armor protects the 
wire from physical damage. BX is installed in a manner similar to flexible conduit. 
7-63  
The armor must be stripped back about eight inches from the end before BX can be attached to a junction box. 
This is done by cutting through the armor at an angle with a fine-tooth hacksaw blade. You must be careful not to 
damage the insulation on the wire. The end of the armor is then twisted off.

The sharp edge of the cut armor is covered by a fiber bushing, called an anti-short bushing, as shown in Figure 
7.8. A special BX connector is then used to grip the end of the armor and allow for a secure connection to a 
junction box. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Conduit Fill 
7-65  
The number of conductors allowed in a conduit is specified by the NEC. The conduit cannot be filled to more than 
40 percent of its cross-sectional area. The number of conductors occupying the conduit depends on the sizes of 
the conductors and type of insulation. Tables in Lesson 9 of the NEC show the number of conductors for various 
kinds of wire in various sizes of conduit. 
7-66  
The NEC also specifies how mixed sizes may be used in a conduit, and how more than three conductors may be 
used. The current-carrying capacity of a conductor, often called ampacity, is specified in other tables in the NEC.

Splicing Conductors 
7-67  
Before making a splice, always make sure the power is turned off. Then remove the insulation from the end of the 
conductor to expose the metal. If you use a knife, cut the insulation away in the same way you cut away the wood 
when you sharpen a pencil with a knife. Be careful not to nick the wire. 
7-68  
Special insulation strippers are available that will cut through the insulation without nicking the wire. The tool 
then slides the insulation off the end, exposing the bare wire. 
7-69  
Wires are often connected with solderless connectors instead of by splicing. These connectors make the job of 
joining wires quite simple. Large wires that are difficult to twist are joined with split-bolt connectors, as shown in 
Figure 7.9. Smaller wires that are easy to twist together can be joined with wire nuts. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-70  
A pigtail splice, shown in Figure 7.10, is one of the most common splices. It is used mostly in junction boxes and 
pull boxes. The ends of the wires are stripped about 1½ - 2 inches and twisted together to make the splice. 
Sometimes the pigtail is bent over so the ends of the wire will not puncture the tape as it is applied.

A lighting fixture can be connected to a branch circuit wire with a fixture splice, if the fixture wire is smaller than 
the branch wire. Start by winding the fixture wire around the branch wire, as shown in Figure 7.11. Then bend the 
end of the branch wire back, and continue wrapping the fixture wire over the bent branch wire. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7-72  
When a splice is complete, you should solder it and tape it with plastic tape and friction tape. Soldering adds some 
strength to the splice, but you should not rely on soldering for mechanical strength. The main purpose of soldering 
is to make a good electrical contact. A soldered splice will last for many years.

Summary 
Metal wires, transistors, microprocessors, and many other devices that depend on the flow of electricity are 
constructed from materials with many free electrons. These materials are called conductors. Most metals are good 
conductors. 
Non-conducting materials are also important to the proper operation of electrical equipment. These materials are 
called insulators or dielectrics. Many nonmetallic materials are good insulators. 
The basic unit of measurement for a conductor is the mil – 0.001 inches. A circular mil is the area of a circle one mil in 
diameter. Wire diameter is designated by a gauge number. 
In selecting an insulating material, you should look for materials that possess high dielectric strength, temperature 
resistance, flexibility, mechanical strength, and moisture resistance. No one material will have all these qualities. 
Friction, rubber, and plastic tapes are useful for insulating. Varnished-cambric tape is superior in some areas because 
it does not melt. 
Conductors may need protection depending on how and where they are installed, and how they are used. They are 
usually enclosed in solid protective channels called raceways. Common raceways include various types of conduit.

Series Circuit: A circuit having only one path for electricity to follow 
Parallel Circuit:  A circuit having two or more paths for electricity to follow 
 
Direct current is widely used in industry. Because its use is so common, the trainee should be well acquainted with DC 
characteristics. 
In this Lesson, we explain Ohm's Law and how to apply it in solving problems in dc circuits. We also explain how to 
calculate the amount of power consumed by an electrical load. 
Depending on the needs in your plant, dc circuits may be connected in series, in parallel, or in series-parallel. This Lesson 
includes examples of each type of connection for you to study and follow when working with dc circuits. 
To troubleshoot a faulty circuit, you must be familiar with electrical test equipment. Always follow the warnings and 
safety information given in this Lesson when using such devices. 
 
 

139 
 
DC Characteristics 
8-1  
Electric current that flows in only one direction is called Direct Current (abbreviated dc). In order to achieve direct 
current, the potential difference across a load must not change direction. 
8-2  
In some dc applications, the potential difference may change in magnitude. But in most the potential difference 
remains fairly constant. Then, if the resistance of the load does not change, the current through the load remains 
constant. If the current remains constant and in one direction, the electromagnetic field around each conductor 
also remains constant. 
8-3  
To help you "see" how a simple dc circuit works, you can compare it to a simple water system. In the water system, 
a pump produces a difference in pressure between its intake and outlet ports. If a continuous pipe connects the 
two ports, leading through a restriction, the difference in pressure makes water flow, as shown on the left in 
Figure 8.1. 
8-4  
In an electrical circuit, a generator may be used to produce a difference in potential between its positive and 
negative terminals. If a continuous conductor connects the two terminals, leading through a resistor, the 
difference in potential makes electrons flow as shown at the right in Figure 8.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-5  
In the water system, the pump rotates in only one direction and water flows through the pipe in only one direction. 
The same is true in the electrical system. If the generator rotates in only one direction, the current flows in only 
one direction. 
8-6  
In the water system, the flow of water depends on two factors: 
 
The difference in pressure between the ports of the pump, and  
 
The amount of resistance in the restriction.  
Likewise, in the electrical system the flow of electrons depends on two factors: 
 
The difference in potential between the terminals of the generator, and  
 
The resistance of the resistor.

DC Characteristics (continued) 
8-7  
If the pump produces a greater difference in pressure between its ports, water will flow faster through the pipes 
and the restriction. Similarly, if the generator produces a greater difference in potential between its terminals, 
electrons will flow faster through the conductors and the resistor. 
8-8  
The restriction in the water system interferes with the flow of water. Likewise, the resistor in the electrical system 
interferes with the flow of electrons. 
8-9  
In the water system, water cannot flow unless there is a complete pathway from the outlet port to the inlet port. 
If the valve is turned in the OFF direction, the pathway is broken by a solid wall of metal, and the water cannot 
flow. In the electrical system, the switch performs the same function as the valve. If it is turned in the OFF 
direction, the electrical pathway is broken by an air gap, and electrons cannot flow. 
8-10  
The flow of water is defined as the amount of water passing a specific point in a standard interval of time. The 
volume is usually measured in gallons, and the time interval is usually one minute. That is, the flow of water is 
usually measured in gallons per minute. 
8-11  
The flow of electricity is defined as the amount of charge passing a specific point in a standard interval of time. 
The charge is usually measured in coulombs, and the time interval is usually one second. That is, electric current 
is usually measured in coulombs per second. One coulomb per second is defined as one ampere. 
 
Ohm's Law 
8-12  
Ohm's law describes the relationship among the potential difference across a load, the current through the load, 
and the resistance of the load. The law looks very simple in mathematical form. 
 
  
E  =  I x R 
 
where  E  =  Potential difference measured in volts 
 
  
I   =  Current measured in amperes 
 
  
R  =  Resistance measured in ohms 
8-13 
You can see from the mathematical expression that Ohm's law combines two simple ideas. 
 
Current in a load increases if the potential difference across the load increases and the resistance stays the 
same. 
 
Current in a load decreases if the resistance of the load increases and the potential difference across it stays 
the same. 
8-14 
This law is the most important electrical relationship, and the one you will use most in working with electricity. 
To understand electricity, you must understand Ohm's law and how to apply it effectively in solving electrical 
problems. With Ohm's law you can calculate any one of the three quantities if you know the other two. 
 
 

141 
 
Ohm's Law (continued) 
8-15 
You can use Ohm's law in three different ways. You can use it to find: 
 
 
E when you know I and R: 
E  =  I x R 
 
 
I when you know E and R: 
I  =  E/R 
 
 
R when you know E and I: 
R  =  E/I  
All these equations express the same relationship among the three variables. If you can remember the first one, 
you can figure out the other two by simple algebra. 
8-16  
For practice in using Ohm's law, examine the diagram in Figure 8.2.  The table lists five combinations of potential 
difference across the load, current through the load, and resistance of the load. In each case, one of the values is 
missing. 
 8-17  
Calculate the missing value for each case, and write it in the proper blank space in the table. The correct answers 
appear on page 159 of this Chapter.

142 
 
Applying Ohm's Law  
 8-18  
Ohm's law can be applied to an electric circuit as a whole, or it can be applied to any part of it. Once you 
understand the basic idea expressed by Ohm's law, you will be able to solve many electrical problems. 
8-19  
For example, you will be able to calculate the potential difference across a single resistor, if you know its resistance 
and the current passing through it. You will be able to calculate the current flowing through a resistor if you know 
its resistance and the potential difference across it. 
8-20  
Your work will be simplified if you remember to apply all parts of Ohm's law to the same section of the circuit. 
 
When applying Ohm's law to the entire circuit, the potential difference across the entire circuit equals the 
current in the entire circuit multiplied by the resistance of the entire circuit. Note that the phrase "entire 
circuit" applies to all three parts of Ohm's law. 
 
When applying Ohm's law to only one part of a circuit, the potential difference across that part of the circuit 
equals the current in that part of the circuit multiplied by the resistance of that part. 
 
 
 

143 
 
Circuit Power 
8-21  
Power is defined as the rate of doing work. The usual symbol for power is P. The standard unit for measuring work 
is the joule, and the standard unit for measuring time is the second. Doing work at the rate of one joule per second 
is defined as a power of one watt. 
8-22  
To calculate the amount of power consumed by an electrical load, you can just multiply the potential difference 
across the load, measured in volts (joules per coulomb) by the current flowing through it measured in amperes 
(coulombs per second). That is, 
 
 
  
P  =  E x I  =                     x                        = 
 
 
where   P  =  Power consumed by the load measured in watts 
 
  
E  =  Potential difference across the load measured in volts 
 
  
I   =  Current through the load measured in amperes 
 
8-23  
You can see from Ohm's law that you can calculate the amount of power consumed by a load if you know any two 
of the three basic electrical values—potential difference across the load, current through the load, and the 
resistance of the load. You just use Ohm's law to replace either E or I, whichever one you do not know. 
8-24  
For example, suppose you know the potential difference across a load is 120 volts and the resistance of the load 
is 10Ω. You do not know the current. You use Ohm's law to substitute for I (E = I x R so I = E/R). 
 
 
  
P  =  E x I 
 
  
    =  E x (E/R) 
 
  
    =  𝐸2/R 
8-25  
You can now calculate the power by substituting the actual values for E and R. 
 
  
P  =  𝐸2/R

When you are solving an electrical problem, following the seven steps listed below will help simplify the process. 
1.  Draw a diagram of the circuit. 
2.  Label all parts. 
3.  Write all known values on the diagram. 
4.  Draw arrows to show the directions of electron flow. 
5.  Write the equations you will need. 
6.  Substitute the proper values for the letters in the equations. 
7.  Solve the equations for the unknown values. Use a calculator if possible. 
 
Series Circuits 
8-27  
If a circuit has only one path for electricity to follow in passing through two or more loads, the circuit is called a 
series circuit. This name comes from the fact that all the current flows through all the resistors, one after another, 
in series. Electrons leave the negative terminal of the battery or generator, pass through every load, and return 
to the positive terminal. An example of a series circuit is shown in Figure 8.3. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.3: Series Circuit 

145 
 
Series Circuits (continued) 
8-28  
The total resistance in a series circuit equals the sum of all the individual resistances in the circuit. In Figure 8.3, 
the total resistance equals the sum of, 𝑅1, 𝑅2, and  𝑅3 as expressed by the following equation. 
 
 
 
𝑅𝑇  =  𝑅1 + 𝑅2 + 𝑅3 
 
where 𝑅𝑇  =  Total resistance of all the loads in the circuit 
𝑅1  =  Resistance of Load 1 
𝑅2  =  Resistance of Load 2 
 
 
𝑅3  =  Resistance of Load 3 
8-29  
The current in a series circuit is the same at all points in the circuit. If six amperes of current flow from the 
battery, six amperes also flow through loads 1, 2, and 3. This idea is expressed by the following equation. 
 
 
𝐼𝑇  =  𝐼1 + 𝐼2 + 𝐼3 
 
where 𝐼𝑇  =  Total current 
 
 
𝐼1  =  Current through Load 1 
 
 
𝐼2  =  Current through Load 2 
 
 
𝐼3  =  Current through Load 3 
 
8-30  
When current flows through two or more loads, the potential difference across the terminals of the battery or 
generator is divided into smaller potential differences across the individual loads. Each smaller potential 
difference is called the voltage drop across that load. The ratio of voltage drops equals the ratio of the 
resistances of the loads. 
8-31  
The voltage drop across each load equals the product of the current through the load and the resistance of the 
load, following Ohm's law. The higher the resistance of any one load, the greater the potential difference across 
it and the lower the potential difference across other loads in the series. 
 
 
𝐸𝑇  =  𝐼𝐸1 + 𝐸2 + 𝐸3 
 
where 𝐸𝑇  =  Potential difference between the terminals of the battery or generator 
𝐸1  =  Voltage drop across Load 1 
 
 
𝐸2  =  Voltage drop across Load 2 
 
 
𝐸3  =  Voltage drop across Load 3 
 

146 
 
Series Circuits (continued) 
8-32  
If you add the voltage drops for all the loads, the total equals the potential difference across the terminals of 
the battery or generator. Expressed in mathematical terms, this relationship can be written in the 
following way. 
8-33  
Figure 8.4 is a diagram of a simple series circuit. Some of the values are written on the diagram. Other values are 
missing. Use Ohm's law and the other equations for series circuits to calculate the missing values of potential 
difference, current, and resistance. 
8-34  
As you solve the problems in Figure 8.4, work carefully and slowly. Do not let the large number of unknowns 
confuse you. Solve the problems one at a time. As you work, write each answer on the diagram in the space 
provided. When you are finished, turn to page 159 of this Lesson and check your answers.

Parallel Circuits 
8-35  
Some circuits have two or more paths for the current to follow. Such a circuit is called a parallel circuit. The path 
branches, as shown in Figure 8.5. When current leaves the source, it divides among the branches according to the 
resistances of the loads in the branches. 
8-36  
In a parallel circuit, the potential difference is the same across all the branches. The current in any single branch 
is always less than the total current from the battery or generator. The current in one branch does not affect the 
current in the other branches. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-37  
A break in a parallel circuit stops the current only in the branch with the break. The current from the battery or 
generator is then reduced by that amount. 
8-38  
In the circuit shown in Figure 8.6, the battery produces a potential difference of 12 volts between its terminals. 
This potential difference exists across all three loads—the heater fan, the starter motor, and the lamp. If the fan 
is turned off, the other equipment still works because the current continues in these branches.

8-39  
The lamps on a string of Christmas tree lights may be connected either in series or in parallel. If they are connected 
in parallel, one lamp may burn out without affecting the others. If they are connected in series, all the lamps go 
out when one burns out. 
8-40  
The current may not be the same in all branches of a parallel circuit. In fact, the current cannot be the same unless 
all branches have the same resistance. 
8.41  
Total current from a battery or generator is the sum of the currents in all the branches of a parallel circuit. The 
following equation expresses this relationship for the circuit shown in Figure 8.7. 
 
 
𝐼𝑇  =  𝐼1 + 𝐼2 + 𝐼3 
 
where 𝐼𝑇  =  Total current flowing from the source 
 
 
 
𝐼1  =  Current flowing through Load 1 
𝐼2  =  Current flowing through Load 2 
 
 
𝐼3  =  Current flowing through Load 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-42  
You can calculate the resistance of a parallel circuit quite easily, but the result may surprise you the first time. You 
calculate the resistance in two steps. 
 
In the first step, you calculate the total current flowing in each branch, using Ohm's law, and then add the 
currents to find the total for the circuit. 
 
In the second step, you use Ohm's law again, dividing the potential difference across the branches by the total 
current to find the resistance of the circuit. 
 
 
Figure 8.7: Branch Currents in a Parallel 

149 
 
Parallel Circuits (continued) 
8-43 
Suppose you have a three-branch parallel circuit like the sample shown in Figure 8.8. The resistance in each branch 
differs from the resistance in the other two branches. What is the resistance of the circuit as a whole? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-44 
You begin by calculating the current that will flow through each branch if a potential difference is applied across 
the ends of the circuit. To do so, you must assume a value for the potential difference. 
8-45 
You can assume any value you want for the potential difference, E. The final result – the resistance of the circuit 
– will be the same no matter what value you choose. We will choose a value of 120 volts, because that value 
makes the arithmetic simple. Any other value would give the same result, but the arithmetic might be more 
difficult. 
8-46 
In the first step, you calculate the total current flowing in the circuit. To do so, you calculate the current in each 
branch, and then add those values together to find the total current, 𝐼𝑇. To calculate the current in each branch, 
you use Ohm's law, dividing the potential difference across the branch by the resistance of the branch. 
 
Branch 1:  𝐼1  =        =                       =  6 Amperes 
 
Branch 2:  𝐼2  =        =                       =  4 Amperes 
 
Branch 3:  𝐼3  =        =                       =  3 Amperes 
 
 
 
Total:        𝐼𝑇  =  6 Amperes + 4 Amperes + 3 Amperes  =  13 Amperes 
8-47 
In the second step, you use Ohm's law again. This time you divide the potential difference across the whole circuit 
by the total amount of current through the whole circuit to find the resistance.

Parallel Circuits (continued)

The surprising part of this result is that the resistance of the total circuit is less than the resistance of any one 
branch. This result occurs in all parallel circuits. In fact, the more branches a parallel circuit has, the lower its 
resistance. 
8-49 
The reason a parallel circuit has lower resistance than any of its branches is that each branch provides another 
path for electricity. Each additional path increases the amount of current that can flow through the circuit for 
any given potential difference applied across its ends. The greater the current, the lower the overall resistance 
of the circuit. 
8-50 
The general method for calculating the resistance of a parallel circuit is to use the equation shown below. You 
do not need to choose a value for E when you use this equation. 
 
 
 
 
𝑅𝑇  =   
 
 
where  𝑅𝑇  =  Total resistance 
𝑅1  =  Resistance in Branch 1 
𝑅2  =  Resistance in Branch 2  
 
𝑅3  =  Resistance in Branch 3 
 
 
𝑅𝑛  =  Resistance in Branch n 
 
8-51 
You can see how this equation works by using it on the example in Figure 8.8. When you substitute the three 
resistance values into the equation, you get the results shown below. 
 
 
𝑅𝑇  =                                            =                                        =                                         Ω  =              Ω  =  9.23Ω   
 
 
 
This result matches the result obtained in paragraph 8-47.

Series-Parallel Circuits 
8-52 
Many electrical circuits are combinations of series and parallel circuits. It is not difficult to figure out the values of 
potential differences, currents, and resistances in these combination circuits. All you need to remember is Ohm's 
law, plus the ideas of simple series and parallel circuits. Then you go through the combination circuit step-by-step 
and figure out what you need to know. 
8-53 
Before trying to solve a series-parallel problem, look at the circuit to see how you can divide it into simpler parts. 
Try to simplify these parts in one of the following ways. 
 
If you see two or more resistors in series, treat them as a single resistor equal to the sum of the individual 
resistances. 
 
If you see two or more resistors in parallel, treat them as a single resistor equal to the value of the 
combination. 
8-54 
The example in Figure 8.9 shows a circuit with resistors connected in both series and parallel. Read the following 
paragraphs and perform the calculations described. If you have a calculator, you should use it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-55 
Begin by finding the total resistance for Branch 3. This branch consists of two resistors in parallel, and two others 
in series with the combination. The total resistance is the sum of three parts – 𝑅5 + 𝑅6 + the parallel combination 
of 𝑅7 and 𝑅8. You should calculate a value of 10Ω for the two parallel resistors, and a total of 35Ω for the entire 
branch. 
8-56 
Next, you can combine Branch 3 with Branch 2, and calculate the total resistance of this parallel combination. 
Branch 3 has been reduced to a single resistor, with a value of 35Ω. But Branch 2 consists of two resistors in series. 
The total resistance in Branch 2 is 30Ω. 
8-57 
To combine Branch 2 and Branch 3, you can again use the equation for parallel resistors. The calculation is quite 
easy if you use a calculator. You should find that the total resistance of these two branches is 16.16Ω. 
 
Figure 8.9: Sample Parallel Circuit 

153 
 
Series-Parallel Circuits (continued) 
8-58 The next step is to combine Branch 1 with resistor 𝑅9 and the equivalent for Branches 2 and 3. You can again use 
the equation for parallel resistors. Note that 𝑅9 is in series with the equivalent of Branches 2 and 3. Use the 
equation below and finish the calculation. You should find a value of 953Ω. This value is the resistance of the 
combination of all resistors in the circuit except 𝑅1. 
 
 
 
𝑅𝑇  =                                                    
 
 
8-59 
Finally, you can combine RI with the equivalent of all the other resistors, and get a value for the total resistance 
of the entire circuit. Then you can use Ohm's law to calculate any currents and potential differences you may need 
to know. 
8-60

Open and Short Circuits 
8-62 
An open circuit occurs when a current path in a circuit is broken. An open circuit can be caused intentionally, as 
when you open a switch. It can also be caused accidentally by a break in a conductor or a faulty connection. 
8-63 
A short circuit occurs when the current can avoid flowing through part of the circuit by flowing around it through 
a parallel low-resistance path. When two parallel paths are available, the path having the lower resistance carries 
the larger fraction of the current. The greater the difference in resistance, the greater the difference in current. 
 
8-64 
Short circuits can occur because of improper wiring or because two bare conductors touch. A short circuit usually 
provides a very low-resistance path that carries nearly all the current. It effectively prevents the current from 
flowing to electrical components beyond the point where the "short" occurs. 
 
8-65 
In the series circuit shown in Figure 8.11, a short has occurred after resistance 𝑅1. This short has the effect of 
removing 𝑅2 and 𝑅3 from the circuit, because almost no current flows through them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-66 
Before the short occurred, the current in the circuit was 4 amperes (120 volts / 30Ω = 4 amperes). The potential 
difference across 𝑅1 is 40 volts (4 amperes x 10Ω = 40 volts).  
8-67 
After the short, the full potential difference—120 volts—is applied across 𝑅1. Using Ohm's law, you can calculate 
that the current through 𝑅1 increases to 12 amperes. 
 
 
Figure 8.11: Shorted Series Circuit 

156 
 
Open and Short Circuits (continued) 
8-68 
Compare the series circuit in Figure 8.11 with the parallel circuit in Figure 8.12, which has a short at a similar 
location. The low-resistance short carries a large additional current in the circuit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8-69 
Unlike the short in the series circuit in Figure 8.11, the short in the parallel circuit in Figure 8.12 does not change 
the current in 𝑅1, 𝑅2, or 𝑅3. Neither does it change the potential difference across these resistors. 
8-70 
If the short has a resistance of 0.1Ω, it will carry 1200 amperes (I = E/R = 120 volts / 0.1Ω = 1200 amperes). This 
current is 100 times the current that normally flows through each branch of the circuit. The short will almost 
certainly overheat, and may cause a fire or other damage unless a fuse or circuit breaker interrupts the current. 
8-71 
You can see the area of trouble in Figures 8.11 and 8.12. But what if you had to work on an actual installation 
where the source of the trouble is not so apparent? Is the trouble a short circuit? Or is it an open circuit? And 
exactly where is the point of trouble? 
8-72 
Both open circuits and short circuits affect the total circuit resistance. The logical thing to do in either event is to 
measure the resistance. You can make the measurement with an ohmmeter. 
 
 
 
8-73 
In general, you should open the circuit switch before troubleshooting a circuit. If necessary, you can use a 
voltmeter to find whether there is a potential difference across each resistor. But measuring potential difference 
requires that the circuit be energized, so use extreme care to avoid a shock. 
Figure 8.12: Shorted Parallel Circuit 
WARNING 
Never use an ohmmeter without first disconnecting 
the circuit from the power source. Using an ohmmeter 
on an energized circuit can destroy the meter 
mechanism and cause injury to you.

Summary 
Direct current is electric current that flows in one direction only. In dc, the direction of the potential difference also 
remains the same. The relationship between the potential difference, the current, and the resistance is explained by 
Ohm's law. 
Any electrical problem is easier to solve if you follow sequential steps. First, draw a diagram of the circuit and label all 
parts. Next, write all known values on the diagram. Draw arrows to show the directions of electron flow. Then, write 
the equations you will need and substitute the proper values for the letters in the equations. Finally, solve the equations 
for the unknown values. Use a calculator if you have one. 
DC circuits can be connected in series, in parallel, or in series-parallel. A series circuit has only one path for electricity 
to follow in passing through two or more loads. Parallel circuits have two or more paths for the current to follow. Series-
parallel circuits have resistors connected both in series and in parallel. 
Both open and short circuits are potentially dangerous because the current flows along a low-resistance path. If you 
are using an ohmmeter to measure the resistance, first make sure to disconnect the circuit from the power source.

Alternating current is the form of electrical power most widely used throughout the world. As more devices using 
electrical and electronic controls are developed, the need for knowledge about ac circuits increases. Today's trainee 
must continually expand his understanding of ac circuits if he is to keep up with industry's use of electrical equipment. 
In this Lesson, we explain the basic principles of ac, the advantages of alternating current, and basic characteristics of 
ac circuits. 
 
As you study this Lesson, pay special attention to the terms. Some have been defined in previous Lessons in this Unit. If 
any terms are confusing, refer back to the previous Lessons. 
 
 

162 
 
Advantages of Alternating Current 
9-1  
Direct current (dc) flows continuously in one direction. It does so because the potential difference across the 
terminals of the source never changes direction. But with alternating current (abbreviated ac), the potential 
difference and the current both change direction at a regular rate. 
9-2  
In the United States, the standard alternating rate for electric power is 60 hertz (abbreviated Hz). Sixty Hz means 
the current goes through 60 complete cycles of directional change, from one direction to the other and back again, 
every second. In Canada, the standard rate is also 60 Hz. Throughout the world, the standard rate for ac power is 
either 50 Hz or 60 Hz. 
9-3  
Power companies use ac generators, also called alternators, instead of dc generators to produce electric power. 
They do so because the alternating current can be transmitted over long distances at low cost. The main reason 
for the low cost is that alternating current can be "transformed." That is, the potential difference can be raised or 
lowered, depending on need. 
9-4  
A transformer can increase or decrease the potential difference of ac electricity with almost no loss of power. The 
cost is therefore very low. Direct current cannot be transformed from one potential difference to another. 
9-5  
Transforming is important in keeping costs low, because of the nature of electric power. Remember that electric 
power is defined as the product of the potential difference across a circuit element and the current through it. 
This relationship is expressed by the first equation below. 
9-6  
From this definition and Ohm's law, you can see that the loss in power as current passes through a resistor 
depends strongly on the amount of current in the resistor. This relationship is expressed by the second equation 
below. 
  
 
P  =  E x I 
                 
𝑃𝐿  =  𝐼2 x R 
 
where  P  =  Electric power entering or leaving a transmission line in watts 
                            𝑃𝐿 =  Power lost in passing through the line in watts 
        E  =  Potential difference between the line and electrical ground in volts 
        I   =  Electric current in the line in amperes 
        R  =  Resistance if the line in ohms 
9-7  
You can see from the second equation above that multiplying the current by ten increases the power loss by a 
factor of 100, because the power loss varies with the square of the current. 
9-8  
A transformer changes alternating current from one combination of potential difference and current to another 
combination. The amount of power neither increases nor decreases. The power that goes into a transformer 
equals the power coming out. 

163 
 
Advantages of Alternating Current (continued) 
9-9  
For example, a transformer might receive electricity from the generator at 10,000 volts and 50 amperes. It might 
deliver electricity into the transmission line at 250,000 volts and 2 amperes. The power going into the transformer 
equals the power coming out (10,000 volts x 50 amperes  =  250,000 volts x 2 amperes  =  500,000 watts). 
9-10  
The transformer has multiplied the potential difference by 25, and it has divided the current by 25. This reduction 
in current from 50 amperes to 2 amperes cuts the power loss (𝐼2  x R) in the transmission line by 99.84 percent. 
9-11  
Direct current cannot be transformed to higher or lower potential differences. If it is transmitted over a long 
distance line at a potential difference low enough to be useful at the destination, the current required is very high. 
The high current produces heat in the transmission line, and greatly reduces the power delivered at the 
destination. 
 
Generating Alternating Current  
9-12  
The manner of generating alternating current is shown in Figure 9.1. A two-pole alternator is shown with a wire 
loop rotating through a magnetic field. The loop is "open." That is, the ends are not connected to each other or to 
anything else. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.1: Potential Difference Generated in a Two-Pole Alternator 

164 
 
Generating Alternating Current (continued) 
9-13 
The following paragraphs describe variations through the magnetic field. 
 
Position 0 - 0°: Note that the loop is moving parallel to the magnetic field.  Therefore, no potential difference 
is generated between the ends of the loop.  The graph at the right shows a value of zero at Position 0 on the 
horizontal axis. 
 
 
Position 1 - 30°: In this position, the loop is crossing the magnetic field at an angle of 30° going toward the 
left. As a result, a potential difference is generated between the ends of the loop. This potential difference is 
represented in the graph by the positive value at Position 1. 
 
 
Position 2 - 60°: The loop is now cutting the magnetic field at an angle of 60°. The potential difference between 
the ends is higher as a result of the increased angle. The graph at the right shows a higher positive value at 
Position 2. 
 
 
Position 3 - 90°: The loop is cutting the magnetic field at an angle of 90° in this position.  The potential 
difference produced between the ends of the loop is therefore at its maximum. The graph shows this peak 
value at Position 3. 
 
 
Position 4 - 120°: The loop is now cutting through the magnetic field at an angle of 60° again. The potential 
difference is still positive, as when the loop was in Position 2 but the value is dropping. You can see this 
decrease on the graph. 
 
 
Position 5 - 150°: Now the loop is cutting through the field at an angle of 30°, just as when it was in Position 
1.  The potential difference shown on the graph has dropped to the same value as at Position 1. 
 
 
Position 6 - 180°: In this position the loop is again moving parallel to the magnetic field.  Therefore, no 
potential difference is generated between the ends of the loop.  The graph shows a value of zero at Position 
6. 
 
 
Position 7 - 210°: The loop is now cutting across the magnetic field at an angle of 30° again but it is moving 
toward the right instead of the left. Therefore, the potential difference between the ends of the loop is in the 
opposite direction.  On the graph, this reversal appears as a negative value. 
 
Position 8 - 240°: The angle at which the loop cuts the field is 600 and the potential difference is higher again. 
However, the graph shows that the direction is still opposite the original direction, because the loop is moving 
toward the right instead of the left. 
 
Position 9 - 270°: The loop now cuts the magnetic field at an angle of 90°. The potential difference is at its 
maximum value, but in the "negative" direction. 
 
Position 10 - 300°: The cutting angle has been reduced to 60° again, and the graph shows that the potential 
difference is returning toward zero. However, the direction is still negative. 

165 
 
 
 

166 
 
Generating Alternating Current (continued) 
 
Position 11 - 330°. The loop now cuts the magnetic field at only 30°. The potential difference is reduced still 
further, and it is still in the negative direction. 
 
Position 12 - 360°. The loop is now back in its starting position. Its motion is again parallel to the direction of 
the magnetic field. Therefore, the potential difference between the ends of the loop is again zero for an 
instant.  
9-14 
One complete revolution of the loop produces one complete alternation in the value and direction of the potential 
difference generated, as shown by the graph in Figure 9.1. The number of cycles completed every second is called 
the frequency of the alternation, measured in hertz. 
 
Effective and Average Values 
9-15 
You may wonder how to express the current and potential difference for alternating current. Both values are 
continually changing. 
 
You could measure the value at any instant, but the value would be different at every instant. 
 
You might realize that the average value for a full cycle is zero, for either current or potential difference, 
because for every positive value there is an equal negative value. 
9-16 
The average value over half a cycle is not zero. To understand how such an average is calculated, think of a graph 
for half a cycle, as shown in Figure 9.2. This graph has the shape of half a sine curve. You can measure the area 
under the curve. Then to calculate an average, you find a constant value that has an area underneath it that equals 
the area under the sine curve. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.2: Average Potential Difference 

167 
 
Effective and Average Values (continued) 
9-17 
Figure 9.2 shows this average for potential difference. The average equals 0.637 times the maximum value, 
represented by the peak of the sine curve. The graph of current is also a sine curve, so the average current equals 
0.637 times the maximum value of current. 
9-18 
One ampere of average alternating current has less effect than one ampere of direct current. Therefore, you 
should not use the average current or potential difference in making electrical calculations involving alternating 
current. You should use the effective value instead. 
9-19 
To compare the effects of ac and dc, you should equate their heating effects. Alternating current is said to have 
an effective value of one ampere when it produces heat in a given resistor at the same rate as one ampere of 
direct current. 
9-20 
The effective value of alternating current can be figured out without actually passing electricity through a resistor. 
It can be determined either by graphing or by calculating it mathematically. The result is the same for both 
methods. The effective value of current or potential difference in ac is 0.707 times the maximum value, if the 
graph has the shape of a sine curve. This effective value is called the root-mean-square value (abbreviated RMS). 
The value 0.707 equals half the square root of two ( √2 / 2). 
9-21 
Examples of AC values are shown in Figure 9.3. The maximum potential difference, 𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥, is 170 volts. The effective 
and average values are calculated below. 
𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥  =  0.707𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥 
            =  0.707 x 170 Volts 
            =  120 Volts 
 𝐸𝑎𝑣𝑔  =  0.637𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑥 
 
 
            =  0.637 x 170 Volts 
 
 
            =  108 Volts

Effective and Average Values (continued) 
9-22 
The RMS values are always used for electrical calculations. AC meters measure RMS values for potential 
differences and currents. You should assume all values of current or potential difference are RMS values, unless 
stated otherwise. 
 
Electrical Degrees 
9-23 
One complete cycle of ac consists of 360 electrical degrees. The cycle is shown by the graph in Figure 9.4. The 
electrical degrees are printed along the horizontal axis. The cycle begins in a positive direction at 0° (at the far left 
on the graph). The potential difference there is zero. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-24 
The value rises until it reaches a maximum at 90°. From 90°, the value decreases, passing through zero at 180°. It 
continues to decrease, taking on negative values until it reaches a minimum value (meaning a maximum negative 
value) at 270°. Then the potential difference begins increasing again, and it returns to zero at 360°. You can see 
that 360° is the starting position, the same position as 0°. 
9-25 
A complete cycle occurs when a conductor passes one pair of magnetic poles (a north pole and a south pole). How 
far the conductor must rotate to generate one complete electrical cycle depends on how many north and south 
magnetic poles are in the generator. 
 
 
Figure 9.4: Electrical Degrees 

169 
 
Electrical Degrees (continued) 
9-26 
How far the conductor rotates is measured in mechanical degrees of rotation. How much of a complete electrical 
cycle the conductor generates is measured in electrical degrees of rotation. One complete rotation of the 
conductor equals 360 mechanical degrees. One complete electrical cycle equals 360 electrical degrees. 
 
In a two-pole generator, the conductor makes one complete revolution (360 mechanical degrees) to produce 
one complete electrical cycle (360 electrical degrees), as shown at the left in Figure 9.5. 
 
In a four-pole generator, the conductor makes only half a revolution (180 mechanical degrees) to produce 
one complete electrical cycle (360 electrical degrees), as shown at the right in Figure 9.5. 
The more poles a generator has, the fewer mechanical degrees are required to generate a complete cycle of 360 
electrical degrees. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-27  
The frequency of electricity generated depends on the number of magnetic poles in the generator and on the rate 
at which the conductor rotates. You can calculate the frequency of an AC generator by placing the proper values 
in the following equation. 
 
 
 
 
ƒ  =   
   =   
Where  
ƒ   =  Frequency of the alternating current in hertz 
 
 
P  =  Number of north and south magnetic poles in the generator 
 
 
N  =  Number of times the conductor rotates per minute (RPM) 
9-28  
For example, suppose you need to calculate the frequency generated by an 8-pole alternator that runs at 900 
revolutions per minute. You simply enter these values into the equation, and use simple arithmetic to calculate 
the result. You should use a calculator, if you have one.

Resistance in AC Circuits 
9-29  
Many ac circuits are mainly resistive. That is, they consist mainly of resistors, without inductors or capacitors. For 
example, resistors, lamps, heating elements, and other simple electrical devices have very little inductance or 
capacitance. In practice, they are considered to be purely resistive, with little or no inductance or capacitance. 
The effect of inductance and capacitance in ac circuits will be explained in later paragraphs. 
9-30  
When only resistive devices occur in an ac circuit, you can use Ohm's law exactly as in a dc circuit. The equation 
for Ohm's law (E = I x R), and the equation for power (P = E x I) also apply to all resistive ac circuits. 
9-31  
When you connect an ac power source to a resistor, the potential difference rises and falls, reaching a maximum 
value first in one direction and then in another. The current in the resistor changes at the same time and in the 
same direction as the potential difference. Therefore, voltage and current are said to be in phase in a resistive ac 
circuit. The relationship between potential difference and current is shown by the graph in Figure 9.6. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.6: Current in Phase with Potential Difference 

171 
 
Inductance in AC Circuits 
9-32  
Inductance is the property of a coil of wire that opposes any change in the current flowing through the coil. The 
opposition to changes in current is an electromagnetic effect. A potential difference is induced in a conductor 
whenever the conductor moves across a magnetic field and whenever the magnetic field changes around a 
conductor. 
9-33  
In addition to opposing a change in current, a coil delays the change. Figure 9.7 shows the delay. Notice that the 
frequency of the current equals the frequency of the potential difference. That is, the time between peaks is the 
same for both curves in Figure 9.7. But the curve for current is delayed 90° compared to the curve for potential 
difference. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-34  
When the current is constant, as in a dc circuit, the magnetic field around the conductor is also constant. But when 
the current changes continuously, as in an ac circuit, the magnetic field around the conductor also changes 
continuously. As current increases from zero to a maximum value, the magnetic field around the conductor 
increases from zero to a maximum value. As the current returns to zero, the magnetic field around the conductor 
also decreases. 
9-35  
In any conductor, an increasing or decreasing magnetic field generates its own potential difference across the 
conductor. This induced potential difference opposes the potential difference of the source. 
9-36  
If potential difference of the source increases in the positive direction, the increasing current in the coil generates 
a second potential difference in the negative direction. The combined effect of these two potential differences 
produces a current that is reduced and delayed from what it would be without inductance in the circuit. 
 
 
Figure 9.7: Current lagging Potential Difference 

172 
 
Inductance in AC Circuits (continued) 
9-37  
This effect is summarized in a statement known as Lenz's law as stated below. 
"The induced potential difference in any circuit is always in a direction that opposes the effect that produced it." 
9-38  
The inductance of a coil depends on several factors, including the number of turns of wire, the shape and size of 
the coil, how the wire is wound, and the material used in the core of the coil. Figure 9.8 shows the variations in 
coils. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-39  
Another important factor in inductance is the "linkage" among the magnetic fields produced at various points 
along the conductor. Inductance is very small in a straight conductor, because there is little linkage of the 
magnetic fields from various points on the conductor. Inductance increases when the conductor is wound in the 
shape of a coil, because there is more linkage. 
9-40  
In equations, the value of inductance is usually represented by the letter L. The unit of measurement for 
inductance is the henry. A conductor has an inductance of one henry when current changing at the rate of one 
ampere per second in the conductor causes an induced potential difference of one volt. 
9-41  
An inductance smaller than one henry may be measured in smaller units. The millihenry equals one thousandth 
of a henry, and the microhenry equals one millionth of a henry. 
9-42  
When an inductor opposes changes in the current in an ac circuit, the opposition is called inductive reactance. 
Inductive reactance is measured in ohms, like resistance, but it differs from resistance in two important ways. 
 
Inductive reactance has no effect on a steady dc circuit. 
 
The amount of inductive reactance depends on the frequency of the alternating current. The higher the 
frequency, the higher the inductive reactance of a given inductor. 
Figure 9.8: Variations in Coil Shapes and Windings 

173 
 
Capacitance in AC Circuits 
9-43  
Capacitance in an ac circuit causes the current to lead the potential difference, rather than to lag behind. In this 
respect, capacitance counteracts the inductance in a circuit. Capacitance is useful in overcoming the inductive 
lag common to most ac motors. 
9-44  
Capacitance is the property of an electric circuit that opposes any change in potential difference between two 
points. 
 
When the power supply tries to increase the potential difference between the points, a capacitor builds up a 
charge internally. By absorbing charge, the capacitor delays the increase in potential difference. As the charge 
builds up, current flows into one terminal of the capacitor and out the other. 
 
When the power supply tries to decrease the potential difference, the capacitor releases charge and delays 
the decrease. As the capacitor releases charge, current flows out one terminal and into the other. 
9-45 
In an ac circuit, the potential difference across a capacitor is always changing. Electric current always flows, 
because the capacitor is either giving up or collecting charge. 
9-46 
The capacitance of a capacitor is represented in equations by the letter C. Capacitance is measured in units called 
farads. One farad is the capacitance of a capacitor that stores one coulomb of charge when the potential 
difference across its terminals is one volt. 
9-47 
Most capacitors have capacitance measured in small fractions of a farad. The units for measuring these small 
capacitances are microfarads (millionths of a farad) and picofarads (millionths of a microfarad). 
9-48 
 A capacitor opposes the flow of current in an ac circuit, just as an inductor does. This opposition is called capacitive 
reactance. It is measured in ohms, just as resistance and inductive reactance are. But capacitive reactance is 
different from either one. 
 
In a steady dc circuit, the capacitive reactance of a capacitor is infinitely large—the capacitor completely stops 
the current. 
 
In an ac circuit, the capacitive reactance depends on the frequency of the source. As the frequency increases, 
the capacitive reactance decreases. 
9-49 
Inductive reactance, capacitive reactance, and resistance are all measured in ohms. The total opposition 
to current in a circuit depends on all three values. However, the three values cannot be added together 
as simply as when the circuit contains only resistance. 
 
 
 
 

174 
 
Capacitance in AC Circuits 
9-50 
When you add together the inductive reactance, the capacitive reactance, and the resistance in a circuit, you must 
add them by vector addition, as shown in Figure 9.9. The resulting value is called the impedance of the circuit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9-51 
Vector addition is explained in detail in another unit on ac circuits. For now, you should understand only that you 
will need to use a special method for such an addition. You will need this method when you evaluate an ac circuit 
that contains capacitors and coils. 
 
 
 
Figure 9.9: Vector Addition of Resistance and Reactance 

175 
 
Current in AC Circuits 
9-52 
When the current and potential difference in a circuit alternate "in step" with each other, the current is said to be 
in phase with the potential difference. In some circuits, the current alternates a little ahead or a little behind the 
potential difference.  The current is then said to be out of phase with the potential difference. 
9-53 
A difference in phase is commonly expressed in electrical degrees.  The value is called the phase angle. 
9-54 
There are three possible phase relationships between current and potential difference in an ac circuit. 
 
The current may be exactly in phase with the potential difference as shown at the left in Figure 9.10.  This 
condition occurs when the circuit contains resistance but no inductance or capacitance. 
 
The current may lag behind the potential difference as shown in the middle portion of Figure 9.10.  The phase 
angle can be as large as 90°. This maximum phase angle occurs in a circuit that contains inductance but no 
resistance or capacitance. 
 
The current may lead the potential difference as shown at the right in Figure 9.10. The phase angle can be as 
great as 90° if the circuit contains capacitance but no resistance or inductance.

Power in AC Circuits 
9-55  
When you calculate power in a dc circuit, you measure the potential difference across a circuit power in a dc 
circuit, you measure the potential difference across a circuit element and multiply by the current through the 
element. You do not need to be concerned about any changes in these measurements with time, because in a dc 
circuit both the potential difference and the current remain steady. 
9-56  
In an ac circuit, you start from the same idea that power is the product of potential difference and current. 
However, you cannot simply multiply the two values, because both values are always changing. 
9-57  
Power at any instant of time in an ac circuit is the product of the instantaneous values of potential difference and 
current, taken from the two sine curves. Power is positive whenever the potential difference and the current are 
both positive or both negative. Power is negative whenever the potential difference and the current have opposite 
signs. Three examples are shown in Figure 9.11. 
9-58  
Average power is a constant value that defines a rectangle on the graph. The rectangle has an area equal to the 
area enclosed by the positive portion of the power graph minus the area enclosed by the negative portion. This 
average power is also called the effective power in the circuit. 
9-59  
When the potential difference and the current are in phase, the average power can be calculated by multiplying 
the RMS potential difference and the RMS current. But if the potential difference is out of phase with the current, 
the average power will be lower in value. If they are 90° out of phase, the average power is zero. 
9-60  
The ratio of the average power to the in-phase power is called the power factor. It is expressed by the following 
equation: 
 
 
 
Power Factor  =   
 
9-61  
You can see from this equation that the power factor equals one only when the potential difference and the 
current are in phase. When they are 90° out of phase, the power factor is zero. The power factor is always equal 
to the cosine of the phase angle.

Summary 
Alternating current is widely used in industry. In ac circuits, both the potential difference and the current change 
direction at a regular rate. The main advantage of ac is that it can be generated, transmitted, and transformed at low 
cost. 
The standard alternating rate of power in the United States is 60 hertz or 60 complete back and forth cycles every 
second. 
Many ac circuits consist mainly of resistors. Connecting an ac power source to a resistor causes the potential difference 
to rise and fall. The current in the resistor changes at the same time and in the same direction. The voltage and current 
are said to operate in phase. If the current is not in phase with the potential difference, the current is said to be out of 
phase. 
Inductance in an ac circuit is the property of a coil of wire that opposes any change in the current flowing through the 
wire. The coil also delays the change. The unit of measurement for inductance is the henry. 
Capacitance in an ac circuit causes the current to lead the potential difference. Therefore, capacitance counteracts the 
lag caused by inductance. Capacitance is measured in farads.

Probably the greatest change in electronics technology was the development of the transistor 30 years ago. Since that 
time the vacuum tube, once the basis of all electronic devices, has largely been replaced by the transistor. And even the 
transistor has been replaced by the integrated circuit in many electronic instruments. 
This Lesson explains all three kinds of electronic devices. Information on the vacuum tube is included because it was the 
forerunner of modern electronics. It is also the most easily understood of the three devices. 
This Lesson is intended as an introduction to electronics. Other units are available which deal specifically with the details 
of this technology. 
 

181 
 
Development of Electronics 
10-1  
Until 1960, the word electronics meant the technology of vacuum tubes. But within ten years after the invention 
of the transistor, in 1951, electronic systems with vacuum tubes were obsolete. The transistor replaced the 
vacuum tube as the basic electronic device, except for certain special uses. Transistors are cheaper to 
manufacture, less fragile, use less electricity, and last longer than vacuum tubes. 
10-2  
In the late 1970s, the technology of manufacturing electronic devices had advanced to the point where a whole 
circuit could be manufactured as a single unit, called an integrated circuit. The most complex of the early 
integrated circuits contained several hundred components, including transistors, resistors, and capacitors all 
properly connected together. 
10-3  
Within a few years, the maximum number of circuit components possible in a single integrated circuit had 
increased to several thousand. Today the number in some integrated circuits is over one million. Integrated 
circuits are widely used in calculators, computers, machine-control systems, automobiles, and countless other 
devices. 
10-4  
In this Lesson, we describe all three kinds of electronic devices. We start with the vacuum tube, because of its 
historical importance and because it is the easiest to understand. Then we describe transistors and integrated 
circuits. 
10-5  
This Lesson is not intended to make you an expert in electronics. It is only an introduction to the subject. If you 
are interested, or if your job requires you to know more about electronics, you should study other manuals that 
deal specifically with the details of electronics. 
 
Electron Motion in a Vacuum Tube 
10-6  
The difference between a vacuum tube and other electrical devices is that in the vacuum tube, electrons do not 
move from atom to atom, as in a conductor. Instead the electrons fly freely through empty space called a vacuum. 
10-7  
Free electrons are "boiled out" of hot metal. The electrons are then repelled by a negative charge applied to the 
metal by an external power supply. The negatively-charged electrons are also attracted by a positively-charged 
plate inside the tube. The attraction and repulsion of the electrons produce the electric current in a vacuum. 
10-8  
A practical way to get large numbers of free electrons in a vacuum is by thermionic emission. Thermionic emission 
takes place when some of the electrons in a hot metal gain enough energy to escape from the surface into the 
vacuum. 
 
 

182 
 
Electron Motion in a Vacuum Tube (continued) 
10-9  
In a vacuum tube, a thin wire is heated electrically until it glows bright orange, as shown in Figure 10.1. At this 
temperature, electrons at the surface of the wire fly off into the space around it. If the temperature of the wire is 
increased, electrons escape from the surface at a faster rate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-10  If the hot wire is not given a negative charge, most of the emitted electrons stay close by. They form an electron 
cloud around the wire. The cloud has a negative charge, because the electrons are negatively charged. The charge 
of the cloud repels other electrons in the hot wire, hindering their entry into the vacuum. 
10-11  The electrons around the wire do not produce an electric current, even if the wire is given a negative charge. A 
second conductor, in the shape of a curved plate, must be placed in the vacuum tube at a distance from the wire. 
A positive charge is applied to the plate. 
10-12  The electrons from the hot wire are attracted to the positively-charged plate. A stream of electrons then flows 
from the hot wire to the plate. An external power supply delivers electrons to the hot wire and removes them 
from the positive plate, maintaining the plate's positive charge. 
10-13  The parts of the vacuum tube described so far have special names. You should memorize these names. 
Filament: Heating element that produces the temperature required to "boil" electrons out of the cathode 
Anode: Curved metal plate with a positive charge 
Cathode: Metal with a negative charge 
 
 
Figure 10.1: Thermionic Emission 

183 
 
Electron Motion in a Vacuum Tube (continued) 
10-14  In Figure 10.1, a single wire serves as both the filament and the cathode. The "A" battery heats the filament to 
proper temperature. The "B" battery produces a potential difference between the cathode and the anode. It 
supplies electrons to the cathode, and puts a positive charge on the anode. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-15  The negatively-charged electrons are attracted to the anode only when the anode is positive with respect to the 
cathode. If you reverse battery "B," making the anode negative with respect to the cathode, no current will flow. 
This effect is an important part of the behavior of a vacuum tube. Electrons can flow in one direction only—from 
cathode to anode. 
 
 
 
Figure 10.2: Cathodes for Vacuum Tubes 

184 
 
Kinds of Cathodes 
10-16  The cathodes used in vacuum tubes are classified into two groups. 
 
Directly-heated cathodes, also called filament cathodes, are heating elements that also serve as cathodes. 
 
Indirectly-heated' cathodes, also called heater cathodes, are separate from their heating elements. 
Most vacuum tubes have indirectly-heated cathodes. 
10-17 The directly-heated cathode is usually shaped like an inverted V, as shown at the left in Figure 10.2. The supporting 
wires are connected to pins in the tube base. A potential difference between the two pins produces a current that 
heats the filament to the proper temperature. 
10-18 Filament cathodes reach operating temperature very quickly when the current starts. If the filament is connected 
to an ac source, the emission of electrons varies because of the varying current. This variation is sometimes 
undesirable. In such cases, a dc source must be used instead. 
10-19 An indirectly-heated cathode consists of two separate elements, a heater and a cathode. The heater is similar to 
the filament of the directly-heated cathode, but it is not designed to emit electrons. 
10-20 The heater is located inside the cathode, as shown at the right in Figure 10.2. The cathode is a hollow metal sleeve 
that fits over the heater. The heater receives electricity through pins in the base of the tube, just as the filament 
does. The heater raises the temperature of the cathode to the operating temperature. 
10-21 An indirectly-heated cathode does not reach emission temperature as quickly as a directly heated cathode. 
However, it also does not vary in temperature when the heater is supplied by an ac source. Therefore, ac power 
can be used in vacuum tubes with indirectly-heated cathodes. 
 
Vacuum-Tube Diode 
10-22 An electron tube that contains nothing but a cathode and an anode is called a diode. The prefix di- means the 
tube has only two electrodes. The heater of an indirectly-heated cathode is not counted as an electrode, because 
it serves no function in the electronic operation of the tube. 
10-23 A diode can conduct current continuously when the anode is positive and the cathode is negative. But it does not 
conduct when the potential difference is reversed. 
10-24 This one-way conducting property of a diode is very useful when changing ac electricity to dc electricity. The 
device that makes such a change is called a rectifier. It requires one or more diodes to prevent electrons from 
flowing backward when the alternating potential difference changes direction. 
 
 
 

185 
 
Vacuum-Tube Triode 
10-25 A vacuum tube with three electrodes is called a triode. The prefix tri- means three. The third electrode is called 
the control grid. The control grid is a wire-mesh structure that fits between the cathode and the anode. It is placed 
closer to the cathode than to the anode. The shape of the grid affects how the tube works. 
10-26 Electrons must pass through the control grid in order to go from the cathode to the anode. If the grid is negative 
with respect to the cathode, the grid will repel some of the electrons and reduce the number that get through to 
the anode. 
10-27 The number of electrons reaching the anode is reduced according to the potential difference between the 
cathode and the grid. If the potential difference is made high enough to repel all the electrons leaving the cathode, 
then the current through the tube will be zero. 
10-28 Any steady dc potential difference between the control grid and cathode is called grid bias. The potential 
difference required to reduce the plate current to zero is called cutoff bias. 
10-29 The action of the grid in the triode is shown by the diagrams in Figure 10.3. 
 
The diagram at the far left shows the triode with cutoff bias applied to the grid. The grid repels all the electrons 
back toward the cathode. No electrons get to the anode. 
 
When the grid has a lower bias applied to it, as shown in the center diagram in Figure 10.3, some electrons 
get through and others are repelled. The electrons that get through the grid continue to the anode, producing 
a small plate current. 
 
When the grid has a small bias, or zero bias, more electrons get through the grid. The plate current is then 
greater. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-30 If you vary the potential difference between the control grid and the cathode, the plate current will increase and 
decrease in response. The changes in plate current will match the variations in the potential difference between 
the cathode and the control grid. 
 
 
Figure 10.3: Operation of a Triode 

186 
 
How a Triode Amplifies 
10-31 The control grid in a triode works much like a control valve in a piping system. It controls the rate at which 
electrons reach the anode. If the grid bias is constant, electrons will flow at a steady rate from the cathode to the 
anode. By adding an ac signal between the grid and the cathode, you can vary the plate current. 
10-32 The signal to the cathode may be very small, and the response in the plate current can be much larger. The output 
into a load resistor is an exact reproduction of the ac signal on the grid, but amplified. The ac potential difference 
across the load can be as much as 100 times greater than the input potential difference applied to the grid. 
 
A Vacuum-Tube Circuit 
10-33  Vacuum tubes used as amplifiers had many industrial applications. For example, the photoelectric circuit, shown 
in Figure 10.4, was used for controlling lighting. When light shined on the cathode of a photoelectric cell, labeled 
𝑉1 in the diagram, the light-sensitive material emitted electrons. These electrons were attracted by the positively-
charged anode, producing a small current. 
10-34  The plate current from the photoelectric cell was too small to operate a relay and turn the lighting on or off. 
Therefore, the current had to be amplified. Before transistors were available, a triode was used to amplify the 
plate current. The triode is labeled 𝑉2 in Figure 10.4. 
10-35  In the circuit, the triode was biased at cutoff. Therefore, no plate current flowed. The cathode of the phototube 
was connected to the grid of the triode. 
10-36  When light fell on the phototube, electrons emitted by the cathode were attracted to the anode of the 
phototube, leaving a deficiency. Electrons were then drawn from the control grid of the triode to replace the 
emitted electrons, making the grid of the triode less negative. The lower bias on the grid permitted enough 
current to flow in the triode to operate the relay. The resistor 𝑅2 was adjusted so the relay operated only when 
the correct amount of light was shining on the photocell. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10.4: Photoelectric Control Unit 

187 
 
A Vacuum-Tube Circuit (continued 
10-37  This circuit operated yard lights and parking-lot lights. The photocell usually faced north when controlling outside 
lighting, so that sunlight never fell directly on the cell. The sensitivity control was adjusted so that the lights were 
turned on at a certain light level in the evening, and off again at a similar light level in the morning. 
10-38  Photocells are still used for this purpose today, and the control circuit is basically the same. However, the circuits 
use transistors or integrated circuits instead of vacuum tubes. 
 
Semiconductors 
10-39  A semiconductor is neither a conductor nor an insulator, but somewhere between the two. A semiconductor is a 
material with more resistance than a conductor, but with much less resistance than an insulator. Silicon is the 
chemical element most widely used as a semiconductor material, but the element germanium is also used. 
10-40  Few free electrons exist in pure germanium or silicon. In their pure form, these materials are not very good for 
transistors. However, when a small amount of the proper impurity is mixed with the germanium or silicon, the 
resistance decreases to the proper level. 
10-41  The materials added as impurities can be classified into two groups, depending on the effect they have on the 
germanium or silicon. One type of impurity produces a material that has a greater number of free electrons. The 
other type produces a material which lacks certain electrons, leaving "holes" in their place. 
10-42  The elements arsenic and antimony are examples of impurities that produce materials with an increased number 
of free electrons. Figure 10.5 shows the internal structure of a semiconductor material made of silicon with arsenic 
as an impurity. Notice that the presence of the arsenic atom produces a free electron in the material. 
 
 
Figure 10.5: N-Type Semiconductor Material 

188 
 
Semiconductors (continued) 
10-43  The resulting semiconductor material is called an n-type material, because when the free electrons move they 
carry negative charges around in the material. An n-type semiconductor is also called a donor, because it can 
"donate" electrons to another material. 
10-44  If a potential difference is applied across an n-type semiconductor, the free electrons move away from the 
negative terminal and toward the positive terminal. That is, the semiconductor conducts charge in the same way 
an ordinary conductor does by means of moving electrons that carry negative charges. 
10-45  The elements aluminum and gallium are examples of impurities that produce materials with "holes" where 
electrons are missing. Figure 10.6 shows the internal structure of a semiconductor made of silicon with aluminum 
as an impurity. Notice that there is an electron missing in the structure. The spot where the electron is missing is 
called a hole. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-46  The holes in this semiconductor material can move around. Each hole is the absence of an electron. Therefore, it 
can be thought of as carrying a positive charge. As a result, the semiconductor material is called a p-type material. 
A p-type material is also called an acceptor, because it can "accept" electrons into the holes. 
10-47  If a potential difference is applied across a p-type semiconductor, the holes move away from the positive terminal 
and toward the negative terminal. That is, the semiconductor conducts charge in the opposite way from an n-type 
semiconductor by means of moving holes that carry positive charges. 
 
 
Figure 10.6: P-Type Semiconductor Material 

189 
 
Semiconductors (continued) 
10-48  The movement of holes in a p-type semiconductor is shown in Figure 10.7. A hole is actually not a physical object, 
but an empty spot caused by the absence of an electron. The hole "moves" because an electron moves from 
another spot to fill the hole. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-49  When the electron moves, it leaves a hole in the place it left. In this way, the hole appears to have moved from 
one place to another, in a direction opposite from the electrons.

Semiconductor Junctions 
10-50  P-type semiconductor material conducts because it has a deficiency of electrons, and the conduction is called hole 
conduction. N-type material has an excess of electrons, and conduction occurs by means of electron flow. 
10-51  When a piece of p-type material is joined to a piece of n-type material, as shown at the left in Figure 10.8, the 
junction is called a p-n junction. This junction can either conduct electricity or not, depending on how the battery 
is connected. 
 
If you connect a battery as shown in the center diagram in Figure 10.8 with the positive terminal connected 
to the p-type material, a current will flow across the junction and through the external circuit. 
 
If you reverse the battery connections, so that the negative terminal is connected to the p-type material, no 
current will flow. This arrangement is shown at the right in Figure 10.8. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-52  The electrons are indicated by the negative signs in Figure 10.8. When the battery is connected as shown in the 
center diagram, the electrons are attracted across the junction from the n-type material into the p-type material. 
Then they move toward the positive terminal of the battery. 
10-53 The holes are indicated by the positive signs in Figure 10.8. They are attracted in the opposite direction across the 
junction by the negative terminal of the battery. With the electrons moving one way across the junction and the 
holes moving the other way, current flows. 
10-54 When the battery is connected in the opposite way, as shown at the right in Figure 10.8, the electrons in the n-
type material are attracted away from the junction, toward the positive terminal of the battery. At the same time, 
the holes in the p-type material are also attracted away from the junction, toward the negative terminal of the 
battery. The material at the junction region then has no current carriers. 
10-55  A junction of p-type and n-type materials works like a vacuum-tube diode. That is, it conducts in one direction but 
not in the other. The junction is even called a "diode." 
 
 
Figure 10.8: Junction Diode 

191 
 
Semiconductor Junctions (continued) 
10-56  The semiconductor diode does not work quite as well as a vacuum-tube diode, because it allows a small current 
to flow in the "wrong" direction. It does so because the n-type material contains a few holes in addition to its free 
electrons, and the p-type material contains a few free electrons in addition to its holes. 
 
Kinds of Semiconductor Diodes 
10-57 A diode is a "two-element unidirectional conductor." That is, it has an anode and a cathode, and it allows current 
to flow in one direction only. A junction diode is made by joining a piece of p-type material (the anode) to a piece 
of n-type material (the cathode). 
10-58 If the positive terminal of a battery is connected to the anode, and the negative terminal is connected to the 
cathode, current flows through the diode. The diode is then said to be forward biased. If the battery connections 
are reversed, the diode is said to be reverse biased. 
10-59 Another type of diode is the point-contact diode. It is made of a very small piece of n-type germanium. A 
phosphor-bronze wire, called a catwhisker, is pressed into the germanium. A large current is then passed through 
the catwhisker into the germanium. This action forms a p-type region around the catwhisker, as shown in Figure 
10.9.

Kinds of Semiconductor Diodes (continued) 
10-60 One use of a semiconductor diode is shown in Figure 10.10. The alternator supplies an alternating potential 
difference, shown by the graph at the left. The diode is connected so that it can conduct electrons toward the left 
and positive charge (holes) toward the right. On the diode symbol, the arrow points in the direction positive charge 
can flow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-61 With the diode connected as shown in Figure 10.10, the potential difference across the resistor varies as shown 
by the graph at the right. When the diode conducts, current flows through the resistor and the potential difference 
increases and decreases. When the diode does not conduct, no current flows through the resistor and the 
potential difference across it remains zero. 
10-62 The graph at the right in Figure 10.10 shows that the potential difference across the resistor looks like the upper 
half of the graph at the left. The lower half of the graph appears to be missing. The output is rectified. That is, the 
current and the potential difference are restricted to one direction only but it is not steady. This kind of circuit is 
called a half-wave rectifier.

Kinds of Semiconductor Diodes (continued) 
10-63 The manufacturers of diodes supply operating specifications for each diode. Reading the specifications will help 
you choose the right kind of diode for a specific use. The specifications include the following kinds of information. 
 
Peak inverse voltage (PIV) is the maximum potential difference that can be applied across the diode in the 
reverse direction without destroying it. 
 
Average rectified forward current is the current the diode can conduct on the average. 
 
Peak rectified current is the maximum current a semiconductor diode can conduct for part of an ac cycle. 
 
Surge current is the maximum current the diode can conduct for one second. 
 
Forward voltage is the forward bias, usually at a definite forward current. 
 
Reverse current is the current at maximum reverse bias. 
 
Transistors 
10-64 The invention of the transistor revolutionized the electronics industry. Transistors are much smaller than vacuum 
tubes, and they are less expensive to manufacture. They are also more rugged than vacuum tubes, and they last 
longer. Transistors do not need a hot cathode to produce electrons, so they operate on far less power and they 
require no warmup period. 
10-65 A transistor consists of two junction diodes joined back-to-back. An example is shown in Figure 10.11. When 
forward bias is applied to the junction on the left, electrons move from the n-type material to the p-type material. 
Holes move in the opposite direction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-66 Many of the holes moving into the n-type material combine with the electrons and are neutralized. But many 
others travel through the n-type material and enter the p-type material at the right. 
10-67 When the junction at the right is reverse biased, as shown in Figure 10.11, you would expect very little current to 
flow. But the additional holes made available from the left-hand junction travel toward the right, providing a 
significant current. 
 
 
Figure 10.11: Transistor 

194 
 
Transistors 
10-68 The result is a strong current through the transistor. The current consists of positive holes moving from the p-type 
material at the left to the p-type material at the right. The current through the conductor attached to the n-type 
material in the middle is much smaller than the current through the body of the transistor. 
10-69 The three sections of the transistor have names based on their function in the device. 
 
Base:  The center section of the transistor 
 
Emitter:  The part of the transistor that, with the base, makes up the forward-biased junction 
 
Collector:  The part of the transistor that, with the base, makes up the reverse-biased junction 
10-70 The current in the emitter determines how rapidly holes enter the collector. These holes, in turn, determine the 
current in the collector. Therefore, the emitter current controls the collector current. 
10-71 The current through the base-emitter junction is very small compared to the current through the transistor as a 
whole. Yet this small current controls the large current. The transistor is said to amplify the base-emitter current. 
10-72 The current in the emitter and collector are almost equal. However, the resistance of the collector is much higher 
than the resistance of the emitter, because the base-collector junction is reverse biased. Therefore, the potential 
difference across the base collector junction is much higher than across the base-emitter junction. Thus, the 
transistor amplifies the potential difference as well as the current. 
10-73 Electric power is the product of potential difference and current (P = E x I). The transistor amplifies both of these 
values. Therefore, it amplifies the power. A small amount of power into the base-emitter junction is amplified to 
a much greater power in the base-collector junction. 
 
 
 

195 
 
Kinds of Transistors 
10-74 The junction transistor, like the one shown in Figure 10.11, can be made in two ways. In one, the base is n-type 
material, and in the other the base is p-type material. The first kind is called a pnp transistor, and the second is an 
npn transistor. 
10-75 The point-contact transistor, shown in Figure 10.12 on the next page, has two catwhiskers placed very close 
together on the surface of a germanium wafer. It is principally of historical interest, because it has been replaced 
in use by the junction transistor. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-76 The point-contact transistor was difficult to manufacture. The two contact points had to be very close together in 
order to provide good operating characteristics. In addition, the point-contact transistors had lower power-
handling capacities than junction transistors. 
10-77 Note the symbols for the kinds of transistors shown in Figure 10.13 on the next page. In the symbol for the pnp 
transistor, the arrowhead on the emitter points toward the base. In the symbol for the npn transistor, the 
arrowhead points away from the base.

Kinds of Transistors (continued) 
10-78 Transistors work well on low potential differences. They are widely used in battery-operated devices. Examples 
include portable radios and calculators. A typical single-battery circuit is shown in Figure 10.14. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-79 The resistor 𝑅𝐸 in the emitter circuit improves stability. The dc current in this resistor applies bias to the base of 
the transistor, making it negative with respect to the emitter. Therefore, a separate battery is not needed to 
provide the base bias. 
 
Microprocessors 
10-80 The general trend in designing electronic circuits has always been to reduce the size of any given circuit. You can 
see this trend if you compare antique devices to modern ones. 
 
A portable tube-type radio made in the 1940s required a sturdy carrying handle and a strong arm to move it. 
The battery made up much of the weight, and the battery life was measured in hours of playing time. A modem 
transistor radio slips into your shirt pocket, and the battery lasts for months. 
 
The first electronic calculator filled a large room. It had thousands of vacuum tubes that consumed many 
kilowatts of electric power. The tubes gave off so much heat that the calculator needed its own ventilating 
system. Today a calculator fits in the palm of your hand and runs on a small battery. 
10-81 The reason for reducing the size of electronic equipment involves more than saving weight and power. In 
calculators and in control equipment, it is also important to save the time it takes for an electric signal to go 
from one component to another. The signal takes less time to travel the length of a short conductor than to 
travel the length of a long conductor. Therefore, the device can perform more steps in a given time. 
 
Figure 10.14: Typical Transistor Circuit 

197 
 
Microprocessors (continued) 
10-82 After the invention of transistors, the next logical step was to manufacture whole circuits with transistors and 
other components in place, connected, and ready to work. These devices are called integrated circuits 
(abbreviated IC). 
10-83 Integrated circuits are mass produced by photochemical methods on a base of silicon. The final product is called 
a "chip." A single chip can include many thousands of transistors and other components all connected together in 
a complex circuit. You can hold it on your fingertip. You need a microscope to see the individual parts. 
10-84 A microprocessor is an integrated circuit used as a miniature computer. It can take information in, perform 
complex calculations, and send the resulting information out to control a process or display information to an 
operator. 
10-85 Some microprocessors are used in controlling complex operations in the plant. Others control only simple devices, 
including motors, valves, and other equipment. A microprocessor system is a group of chips and related 
components. 
10-86 Memory is an important part of a microprocessor system. Two kinds of memory systems are in common use. 
 
Random-access memory (abbreviated RAM) is used for storing information temporarily. 
The microprocessor can recall information from any location in the RAM at any time. When the information 
is no longer needed, that location can be used to store other information. 
 
Read-only memory (abbreviated ROM) is used for storing instructions for the microprocessor. The 
microprocessor uses the information in ROM in a prearranged sequence, rather than randomly. 
10-87  Figure 10.15 is a simple diagram of a microprocessor system. It includes the microprocessor chip, a RAM chip, a 
ROM chip, and an input-output device that controls the flow of information to and from the machine. Figure 10.16 
is a photograph of a microprocessor chip, greatly enlarged.

Summary 
Vacuum tubes, transistors, and integrated circuits are the three basic types of electronic devices. Although vacuum 
tubes are seldom used today, they paved the way for modern electronic technology and are important for that reason. 
The parts of the vacuum tube are the filament, anode, and cathode. The cathodes are either directly heated or indirectly 
heated. A vacuum tube that contains only a cathode and an anode is called a diode. A vacuum tube with three 
electrodes is called a triode. 
A transistor is made up of two junction diodes joined back-to-back. The forward-biased junction is called the emitter. 
The reverse-biased junction is called the collector. The center section of the transistor is called the base. 
Whole circuits with transistors and other components in place, connected, and ready to work are called integrated 
circuits. An integrated circuit is also called a chip. A group of chips and related components is called a microprocessor 
system.
