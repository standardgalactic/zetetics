The entropic expansion principle and expansion within the local group [19.05.2013 
(hypothesis); 28.11.2013 (wrong growth factor approach); 28.02.2014 (wrong growth factor 
approach-2); 25.10.2015 (acceleration only due to 𝑚2); 20.07.2019 (average SBH mass derived 
local 𝐻0); 02.11.2021 (redshift survey on 81 galaxies in the local group)*; 03.11.2021 (corrected 
local 𝐻0)*; 14.11.2021 (six outlaw galaxies when using mainstream expansion scheme; none when 
using EE)*; 15.11.2021 (four outlaws when using lowest possible mainstream expansion)*; 
13.12.2021 (acceleration of exp. cannot be observed directly)*] 
 
*Sponsored by: Lin Yi Song (China). 
 
In chapter 1.3 it was stated that:  
 
“The expansion of space in a region is exactly proportional to the local entropy increase in this 
region. The acceleration of this expansion is due to the exponential growth of entropy in black 
holes (they have a maximum of entropy).” 
 
I want to reformulate this into a new, second law of cosmology (analogous to the second law of 
thermodynamics):  
 
At sufficiently large scales (scales larger than the local group), the entropy density is not increasing, 
nor decreasing. For guaranteeing this form of entropy conservation, the universe is expanding. 
 
Or simpler: 
 
§ The average entropy density of the universe is always constant.  
 
Because of the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy in closed systems has to increase. 
But in an open system like the universe things are different: here any local increase of entropy is 
levelled out by the expansion of space. Since stars will continue to burn and black holes will 
continue to grow for still quite a long time, the expansion of space will not end before life ends.  
 
This second law of cosmology is only possible because of black holes. It makes thermodynamics 
independent from any low entropy border condition.  
 
While searching for a mechanism for the expansion of space I used the analogy of a gas that slowly 
spreads out in space. However, the spreading of a gas increases entropy, while the expansion of 
space itself keeps the overall entropy constant. Nevertheless, this analogy helped me to link the 
expansion of the universe to entropy increase. I asked the question: what if the expansion of space 
is itself a thermodynamic process?  
 
That would indeed solve the mystery of why the universe appears to have started off with a low 
entropy. The answer would be both simple and surprising: it didn’t! 
 
In the primordial universe, black holes were smaller and had a lower entropy, but the distribution 
density of black holes and matter in general was higher, so that the overall entropy density was 
exactly the same as today.  

 
Can such a proportionality between entropy increase and the expansion of space be established 
using concrete observational data? 
 
Before the formation of stars, primordial black holes were the only means of expansion. That 
means this theory requires the existence of primordial black holes, otherwise it does not work. 
That means the universe did not have to wait until stellar black holes form out to be able to expand. 
If that was the case, then stars would have never formed out, because the universe would be too 
dense for them.  
 
If black holes always existed, then that means the increase in black hole mass is quite likely to be 
linear and not abrupt, and in that case the entropy increase would be a simple quadratic function.  
 
Can we actually measure the acceleration of the expansion? 
 
Since 1997, it is widely believed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. The data that 
this is inferred from is shown in fig. 24:  
 
 
Fig. 24. The distance modulus is the difference between apparent magnitude and absolute 
magnitude, with the later depending on the theory one uses. This shows that it is not possible to 
observe things without the use of a theory, or a series of theories competing against each other. 
[http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/].  
 
This graph is plotting redshift against what is called the distance modulus. That is the difference 
between the apparent magnitude 𝑚  and the absolute magnitude 𝑀 , both of which are inverse 
logarithmic measure of the brightness of those supernovae. This explains why the graph goes up. 
Does the distance modulus tell us what the distance to those supernovae is? No, it does not. In fact, 
the absolute magnitude, which is a measure for the brightness of a star as it would appear from a 
distance of 10 megaparsec, can only be calculated when already knowing the distance, and for 
very remote objects, that is only possible by using the mathematics of a theory, that has to be 
assumed correct to begin with.   
 
As we will learn in chapter 4.17, mainstream cosmology calculates intergalactic distances using 

differential equations, which yield a series of linear approximate equations for different redshift 
ranges. For redshifts of up to 𝑧= 0.2 mainstream cosmology uses this very simple equation to 
calculate light travel distances:  
 
𝑡 ≈ 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0
 
 
In chapter 4.12, we will derive a similarly simple approximate equation for intergalactic distance 
in our entropic expansion scheme, which is:  
 
𝑡 ≈ 3 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0
 
 
However, different from the mainstream, entropic expansion uses one single equation for all 
redshift ranges. If the mainstream switching equation at 𝑧 =  0.2 is not justified, then the data 
should be able to tell us that.  
 
Missing out a factor of 3 will make supernovae look a bit faint, but since their luminosity is quite 
irregular, with Ia-supernova performing a bit better as standard candle, the faintness problem is 
not a dead-giveaway at short distances. At the largest distances the GR-distance and the SPD-
distance however disagree by a factor of 39 (see chapter 4.12).  
 
The supernova survey that has led to the general assumption that the expansion of the universe is 
accelerating did not directly observe this acceleration, but instead it was looking at the brightness 
of supernovae, and how they relate to the redshifts. If the universe’s expansion was slowing down, 
as they had assumed, then the most distant supernovae would seem brighter than what one would 
expect from a constant expansion rate. What they observed instead is that distant supernovae are 
fainter instead.   
 
That can either mean that the equations used to calculate the distances depending on the redshifts 
is wrong, or that the universe is expanding in an accelerated fashion.  
 
Assuming an accelerated expansion has explained most of the faint-supernovae anomaly, but not 
all of it.  
 
As it turns out, within the confines of the Friedmann models, there just isn’t any combination of 
matter, dark matter and dark energy, that can simultaneously lead to a universe with no overall 
curvature, and a linear relationship between luminosity and redshift.  
 
How different would a constantly expanding universe look from one that expands in an accelerated 
fashion?  
 
Distances in a universe with a constant expansion rate are always given by:  
 
𝑡 = 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0
 

 
While distances in a universe that expands like a quadratic function are always given by: 
 
𝑡 ≈ 3 𝑐 𝑧
𝐻0
 
 
As we will see in chapter 4.17, a linear relationship between light travel time and redshift is 
supported by the supernova data, while the nonlinear relationship in the mainstream leads to still 
too faint remote supernovae.  
 
Interestingly enough, the choice between a constant Hubble value and a quadratically increasing 
Hubble value can only be made by looking at which of the two leads to apparent magnitudes for 
supernovae that are closer at the theoretically expected average. In chapter 4.17, we will see that 
indeed having that factor 3 in the equation, brings us closer to the expected average.  
 
Now looking at fig. 24 once more, we notice that the graph bends over quite abruptly at 𝑧 =  0.2.  
That is exactly what one would expect if the switching of equations at this value is not justified.  
 
We shall come back to all this in the chapters 4.12 and 4.17. In this chapter we shall focus on the 
issue of whether or not we should expect seeing any effects of the cosmological expansion within 
the Milky Way or the local group. This is the focus of both this chapter, and chapter 4.7.  
 
 
Non-homogeneous expansion 
 
The largest part of entropy in the universe is black hole entropy. Their entropy is so large that it 
dwarfs the entropy from all other sources. The entropy per baryon in the sun is in the magnitude 
of about 1, while in a black hole, it is 1020 (in natural units). We can therefore fully concentrate 
on black hole entropy only.  
 
The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole is given by 
 
𝑆𝐵𝐻 = 𝐴 𝑐3 𝑘𝐵
4 𝐺 ℏ 
 
𝑆𝐵𝐻 = 4 𝜋 𝐺 𝑘𝐵
 ℏ 𝑐
 𝑀2 
 
Using the SPD-version of the Planck length (see chapter 6.8), we can write the SPD-version of the 
above as:  
 
𝑆𝐵𝐻 = 4 𝜋 𝐺|𝕐| 𝑘𝐵 ᵯ2
ℏ 𝑐
 |𝕐|2 
 
Where 𝐺|𝕐| is the quark gravity constant, |𝕐| is the number of quarks, and ᵯ is the reduced proton 
mass (see chapter 6.8).  

 
We can express the statement that the entropy density of the universe is constant mathematically 
as follows:  
 
𝑆+ ∆𝑆
𝑉′
 = 𝑆
𝑉 
 
𝑉′  = (𝑆+ ∆𝑆) 𝑉
𝑆
 
 
Since we are looking only at ratios of entropies here, and since the entropy of a black hole is just 
the square of the mass, or more precisely the quark count, multiplied by some constants, we can 
write the above expression also as:  
 
𝑉′  ≈ (𝑀+ ∆𝑀)2 𝑉
𝑀2
 
 
Or as:  
 
𝑉′  = (|𝕐| + ∆|𝕐|)2 𝑉
|𝕐|2
 
 
Then the local Hubble value in a particular region of space is given by:  
 
∆𝑟 = 3
4 𝜋√𝑉′ −𝑉
3
 
 
𝐻 = ∆𝑟
𝑡 
 
Another way of obtaining the local Hubble value is to look at the squared ratio between mass or 
quark count of largest supermassive black hole in the region in question, and the average mass or 
quark count of supermassive black holes. We can write that as:  
 
𝐻𝐿𝐺 = (
|𝕐|𝑆𝐵𝐻
|𝕐|𝑆𝐵𝐻𝜇
)
2
 × 𝛨0 
 
Or:  
 
𝐻𝐿𝐺 ≅( 𝑀𝑆𝐵𝐻
𝑀𝑆𝐵𝐻𝜇
)
2
 × 𝛨0 
 
Inside the local group, the largest black hole is that at the center of the Andromeda galaxy. It has 
1.1 − 2.3 × 108 sun masses. This is the value range we can use for 𝑀𝑆𝐵𝐻. 𝑀𝑆𝑀𝐵_𝜇 on the other 
hand, is the average mass of supermassive black holes, which is 5,757,999,302 𝑀⊙.  

 
Using a wide range Hubble value of 74.03 km/s/mpc, that leads to the following minimal and 
maximal values for the Hubble expansion rate of the local group:  
 
𝐻𝐿𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≅ 0.000365 × 𝛨0  =  0.027 km
s /mpc 
 
𝐻𝐿𝐺𝑚𝑎𝑥 ≅ 0.001596 × 𝛨0  =  0.118 km
s /mpc 
 
However, as we will see in chapter 4.15, black holes with low redshifts have smaller masses. Using 
the table of supermassive black holes from chapter 4.15, we arrive at an average mass 𝑀𝐷𝐻_𝜇 for 
low redshift supermassive black holes of:  
 
𝑀𝑆𝐵𝐻𝜇(𝑧<1)  =  3,838,964,285.70 kg 
 
Using this value, we arrive at:  
 
𝐻𝐿𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑛 ≅ 0.000821 × 𝛨0  =  0.061 km
s /mpc 
 
𝐻𝐿𝐺𝑚𝑎𝑥 ≅ 0.003589 × 𝛨0  =  0.266 km
s /mpc 
 
We can use these values to create a list of expected expansion redshifts for all the galaxies in the 
local group, and then compare them to the observed red- and blueshifts. The overall redshift or 
blueshift of any astronomical object is always a mix of the doppler effect, related to motion, and 
expansion redshift, related to the expansion of space.

We find that all expansion redshifts expected from an entropic expansion are dwarfed by the red- 
and blueshifts that come from local movement. That is not the case when we assume a 
homogeneous expansion where the Hubble value depends only on time, and not entropy. That is 
the assumption mainstream cosmology is based on. As we can see in the list, this assumption leads 
to 6 outlaw galaxies, which have lower redshifts than allowed by the assumed expansion of space.  
 
Those are:  
 
Leo III 
Andromeda IV 
IC 5152 
NGC 300 
NGC 55 
UKS 2323-326 
 
Supernova surveys focusing on lower redshifts tend to find lower values for 𝐻0. The lowest value 
for 𝐻0  using supernova surveys was 67.4 ±  1.0 km1 s−1 mpc−1  (T. Sedgwick; 2020). When 
using this value, we have only 4 outlaw galaxies, namely:  
 
Leo III 
Andromeda IV 
NGC 55 
UKS 2323-326 
 
Since this is pretty much the lowest possible long range Hubble value, these four outlaws remain 
in every case.  
 
How does mainstream cosmology deal with the missing local expansion?  
 
On all scales smaller than the local group of galaxies, we seem to only observe redshift when an 
object is actually moving away from us. While people still distinguish between expansion redshift 
and movement related doppler redshift, they describe both in similar terms. The Hubble parameter 
for example is expressed in a speed, namely kilometers per second per megaparsec. In the literature 
it is often stressed that this is not really a movement in space, but an expansion of space itself, and 
therefore the light speed limit does not apply. And indeed, we observe many galaxies that have 
redshifts greater than 𝑧 =  1, which would mean they move faster than the speed of light, if we 
were to interpret the expansion as a movement in space.  
 
Despite this apparent clarity, the mainstream seems to require objects to actually move apart for 
their light to become redshifted. In a gravitationally bound system, space can expand without 
things moving apart. That is because the force acting upon objects due to the expansion of space 
is not strong enough to overcome their gravitational attraction. We can say that they are 
gravitationally bound.  
 
Light however is clearly not gravitationally bound; it always leaves any gravitational system. Are 
we to believe that light experiences no expansion redshift at all while inside the local group, and 

then starts to redshift suddenly after leaving the local group? Why should that be?  
 
Claiming that seems to imply that objects are affected by the expansion of space, but light isn’t. 
As a matter of fact, most popular accounts describing the expansion of space state that light waves 
are stretched out by the expansion of space. While this description is universally used when talking 
about cosmology, it is rejected once someone asks about the missing local expansion.  
 
The argument used to explain why light cannot experience gravitational redshift in out of itself has 
to do with the belief that the energy of a photon is always relative.  
 
 
Alleged relativity of speed-related redshift 
 
When we are talking about redshift due to local movement, the Galilean equivalence principle 
seems to suggest that the redshift would always depend on one’s frame of reference. There could 
still be an absolute frame of reference, but that would not change the fact that everyone measures 
a different photon frequency, depending on his or her frame of reference.  
 
Does that mean we cannot ascribe any absolute value to the energy of a photon? The most obvious 
thing to do is to define the energy of a photon always in the frame of reference in which it got 
emitted or reflected.  
 
This also works fine if there is a proper absolute space, as assumed in Poincare’s version of 
relativity theory (1890). One would then simply define the energy of photons as it would be 
perceived in that absolute frame of reference. Such an absolute frame of reference is sometimes 
referred to as an Ether, but this word seems to suggest that fields are made of some primordial 
substance, and not just probability distributions, as assumed in standard quantum mechanics. This 
is not what is meant here with an absolute frame of reference, which we shall refrain from using 
the term ‘ether’ in this context.  
 
Alleged relativity of gravitational redshift 
 
The strong equivalence principle of general relativity claims that gravity and acceleration are 
somehow equivalent. It is postulated that being accelerated in a rocket with earth acceleration is 
indistinguishable from standing on earth. This principle also implies that all objects fall at the same 
rate, regardless of mass or chemical composition.  
 
Using this principle, one can argue that the loss of energy that photons experience when they leave 
a gravitational field, such as that of the earth, is somehow relative, only because an observer that 
falls towards earth, would find these photons to not be redshifted, but blueshifted instead.  
 
First of all, in reality, nobody would measure the energy of photons leaving an object in any frame 
of reference other than that object itself.  
 
Secondly, as we will see in chapter 6, the equivalence principle does not apply in space particle 
dualism theory. Here gravitational mass and inertia mass are not the same. Objects with different 

chemical composition fall at slightly different rates.  
 
Alleged relativity of expansion redshift 
 
In standard cosmology it is assumed that the universe is totally homogeneous and isotropic on 
large scales. This assumption then allows cosmologists to theorize that the whole universe expands 
similar to a grid in which each cell increases its size homogeneously. This grid model is also used 
to claim that the expansion of space can slow down due to gravity.  
 
If we then imagine light to be absorbed and re-emitted by a series of detectors along the grid, then 
we can always describe the redshift experienced by this light as a doppler redshift due to the 
detectors moving away from each other.  
 
We should stop here for a moment, to apricate what this argument is trying to accomplish. In a 
nutshell, relativism, as well as the Copernican principle, namely that the universe is homogeneous 
and isotropic, are used here in order to make us believe that a cosmic microwave background, that 
went from 2,900 Kelvin, at the moment it was emitted, to 2.725 Kelvin today, has not lost any 
energy at all.  
 
In a closed universe the energy lost during the expansion period is returned to the universe during 
the collapse. This kind of universe has been ruled out since the observation that the universe is 
accelerating in its expansion, which means that it will not collapse.  
 
So, because energy conservation cannot be warranted through a closed universe, people have 
moved over to using the relativity of energy in order to avoid seriously rethinking energy 
conservation. We will come back to the issue of energy conservation in cosmology in chapter 4.13.  
 
 
Fig. 25. For 5 out of 81 galaxies in the local group, we find that expansion redshift should be 
visible, but they are not. That can either be explained away with the claim that the expansion of 
space cannot be observed in gravitationally bound systems, or actually explained by showing that 
the local expansion rate is lower than the average.  
 
If the loss of energy in the cosmic microwave background is really relative, then it should be non-
existent for some observers. What observers would that be? While a fast-moving observer would 

see a reduced energy loss in his direction of movement, the loss would still be there, and even for 
the photons in his direction of movement, he would have to constantly increase his speed in order 
to keep pace with the expansion of the universe. This would solve the energy loss issue only for 
one direction. So, unless there can be an observer that can move in all directions simultaneously, 
the energy loss in the cosmic microwave background stands.  
 
But even if we ignore all these logical fallacies, the comoving observers that are assumed to exist 
here, cannot exist, because the universe is not homogeneous at all. Often it is said that it is 
homogenous at scales of more than 250 million light years. Using the intergalactic distances of 
space particle dualism theory, that corresponds to 1  billion light years. However, closer 
examination reveals that not even at this scale is the universe homogenous. As we will learn in the 
next chapter, it is not homogeneous on any scale.  
 
Stylizing expansion redshift as doppler redshift 
 
One central statement of general relativity is that acceleration and gravity are equivalent. This can 
sound very absurd if we try to visualize it. It seems like it is saying that the surface of the earth is 
being accelerated upwards. Since redshift caused by acceleration is basically a doppler redshift, it 
is then claimed that we can view gravitational redshift as expansion redshift.  
 
Since modern physics is addicted to vast generalizations and to taking analogies literally, it also 
claims that we can describe the expansion of the universe with equations that are used for 
gravitational fields. All this despite the fact that the universe does not possess a center of gravity.  
 
As a result, expansion redshift is seen as the cosmological analogue to gravitational redshift. Since 
nearly all cosmologists use Einstein’s field equations to do cosmology, this little analogy is usually 
accepted without further questions.  
 
Even with all this sophistication, it is safe to say, that defenders of mainstream cosmology will still 
have a lot of trouble explaining why an observer needs to be ‘accelerated’ (standing on the surface 
of the earth counts as accelerated) in order to see gravitational redshift, but in cosmology one 
always sees cosmological or expansion redshift, no matter if one is at rest or accelerating.  
 
The very same people who constantly describe expansion redshift as a stretching out of light waves 
through the expansion of space, deny this effect once the topic is local expansion. This shows even 
more that all the sophisticated arguments above are just a way of explaining away the fact that we 
do not observe any local expansion.  
 
 
The original theory of relativity 
 
Aside from that, we should recognize these arguments for what they are: arguments from ideology, 
and not from evidence. Just as Lorentz-Poincaré relativity can do without the ideology of radical 
relativism, so can all the rest of physics, from gravitational physics to cosmology. There is no 
reason to assume absolute relativism.  
 

To me, the fact that Einstein’s relativity was preferred over that of Lorentz (1895)1 and Poincaré 
(1898),2 although Lorentz and Poincaré completed their work much earlier than Einstein, indicates 
that the paradigm of radical relativism was somehow politically favored.  
 
The hyperbolic geometry of spacetime was discovered by Poincaré in 1881.3 Time dilation and 
length contraction were introduced by Lorentz in 1895. The mass-energy equivalence was found 
by Poincaré in 1900.4 Even the name ‘relativity theory’ came from Poincaré, who first coined the 
term ‘relativity principle’.5 These discoveries describe special relativity in its entirety, but without 
giving up the distinction between local time and proper time. Einstein could not prove that this 
distinction is wrong, but by simply stating that it is unnatural, he somehow was promoted as the 
creator of special relativity. Poincaré never gave Einstein credit for special relativity. All Einstein 
did was introducing a new ideology, not new equations. It was the ideological framework that 
made those concepts more widely known.  
 
Poincare’s 1898-work also seems to suggest that he already understood the duality between 
variable light speed and variable time, because he called the constancy of the speed of light a 
convention. This again puts him far ahead of Einstein, who started using this duality only much 
later, in the years 1906 – 1909, before fully accepting the spacetime view, which ontologically 
favors variable time over variable light speed.  
 
But it doesn’t stop there: even parts of the general theory of relativity, such as gravitational waves 
have been proposed a decade before Einstein ever mentioned them. In 1905, Poincaré suggested 
that of the Lorentz transformation requires the existence of gravitational waves which propagate 
with the speed of light.  
 
On top of that all, the final Einstein field equations were discovered by David Hilbert one week 
before Einstein arrived at his solution.6 
  
Is the mass increase really linear? 
 
It doesn’t really matter how much a black hole consumes in a particular year. Hubble expansion is 
only observable at scales where only the average counts. If we average over millions of light years, 
then we average out over millions of years, and so it does not matter anymore if a black hole 
consumed more mass in a particular year than in other years.  
 
More empty space around larger galaxies 
 
When testing entropic expansion in a particular region surrounding a supermassive black hole, the 
most sensitive and crucial factor that has to be taken care of is the volume of this region. It has to 
include all the low-entropy space around the supermassive black hole, because it is this space 
which levels out the high entropy inside the black hole. The examined region should be large 
enough to reach from one largest supermassive black hole to another.  
 
If entropic expansion is correct, then galaxies with smaller central black holes should be 
surrounded by less empty space. The Andromeda galaxy is on a collision course with the Milky 
Way and local expansion is not powerful enough to prevent that. However, the merging of the two 

galaxies will certainly create more empty space around them.  
 
This could be tested in various ways. One way would be to find out if there is really more empty 
space around larger galaxies with larger central black holes.  
 
Another way is to examine if in our immediate neighbourhood galaxies with larger black holes 
tend to have larger redshifts. This type of survey makes of course only sense if it only includes 
supermassive black holes which have no other supermassive black holes between us and them, 
otherwise their redshift will be a sum of the redshift they cause and the redshift the black holes in 
front of them cause.  
 
There is nothing in relativistic cosmology which could tie the expansion rate to the number and 
size of black holes. According to the presented scheme, more black holes and bigger black holes 
cause a faster expansion; and hence they are surrounded by more empty space. In relativistic 
cosmology the opposite would be expected: more black holes decelerate the expansion here.  
 
Although the mass of black holes increases in a more or less linear way, their entropy grows 
exponentially, because it is proportional to the square of the mass. That is what causes the 
acceleration of the expansion.  
 
The calculation above was concerning only the present expansion speed, not the acceleration over 
time. Both the here described entropy density conservation principle and dark energy lead to an 
accelerated expansion. Entropic expansion derives the speed and acceleration of the expansion 
from the entropy growth in black holes, while the dark energy that is used in standard cosmology 
is artificially set to a value that describes the observations correctly. In order for dark energy to 
work it has to be assumed that gravity can exist without there being any centre of gravity, as our 
universe appears to be without a centre and without edges. That implies that before the current 
acceleration phase there was a time in which the expansion of the universe was not accelerating 
but slowing down due to gravity.  
 
We can now test how good entropic expansion describes the observed acceleration of the expansion 
and compare it to the expansion one would expect from dark energy without accounting for gravity.  
 
The near infinite fine tuning in standard cosmology 
 
Before the dark energy concept was introduced it was generally stated that only with dark matter 
there is enough stuff out there to reach the critical density 𝜌𝑐 and to get the universe flat (Ω =
 𝜌𝜌𝑐
⁄
= 1). After dark energy was introduced, cosmologist went over to say that dark energy is 
also needed to have enough mass energy for a flat universe! Yet dark energy has the strange 
property that it becomes more and more as the universe expands, because more and more empty 
space with vacuum energy (supposedly equal to dark energy) is created! From this it should be 
clear that we never really had evidence for a density close to the critical density. Cosmologists 
didn’t really measure the average density, but they calculated the critical density and kept assuming 
that the average density is equal to the critical density, simply due to the fact that our universe 
appears to be totally flat. That means the incredible flatness of the universe has always been in 
gross contradiction to general relativity, because it was never successfully linked to the actual mass 

energy density we observe in the universe.  
 
We also have to wonder how a geometrically flat universe can be accelerating, since only open 
universes with negative curvature are supposed to accelerate their expansion. From a general 
relativity perspective, the expansion of space being so completely uncorrelated to the geometry of 
space is certainly puzzling. From the perspective of space particle dualism, it is entirely natural, 
because here gravity is caused by density differences in granular space. It still is a geometrical 
force here, but unrelated to curvature.  
 
Other research 
 
Interestingly this is not the first proposal to link the accelerated expansion to entropy increase: in 
a work with the name “Entropic Accelerating Universe”, Damien A. Easson, Paul H. Framptony 
and George F. Smoot linked the accelerated expansion to the entropy increase of the cosmic event 
horizon (2010).3 The entropy of this horizon is, however, not related to the actual entropy inside. 
The radius of the cosmological horizon grows with light speed and its size depends solely on the 
age of the universe. That is very similar to the mass growth we assumed for our central black hole 
in the aspect that it is a linear growth. The exponential growth of entropy they get is compared to 
the accelerated expansion of the universe (see fig. 26):  
 
Fig. 26. Entropic acceleration resulting from linear black hole growth (linear growth of radius 𝑅 
or mass 𝑀). 
 
The matter density distribution is expected to be more or less the same for most galaxies. Thus, 
the growth of black hole mass should be quite linear over time. The inactivity of some black holes 
is thus levelled out by the activity of others. 
 
Before the acceleration of the expansion was observed, most cosmologists did not even try to find 
a cause for the expansion itself, because they took it as an initial condition of the Big Bang that 
the universe is expanding. Back then, the expansion rate was thought of to have been fixed at the 
very moment of the Big Bang.  

Therefore, it was a real shock for the scientific community in 1998, when Saul Perlmutter, Brian 
P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Riess found that the universe’s expansion is accelerating. Since then, 
cosmologists tried to explain that with dark energy, a varying cosmological constant, vacuum 
energy, Higgs fields, and vice versa.  
None of these explanations could predict the speed of the expansion, or make it depending on 
something.  
 
Can we say that entropic expansion is an intrinsic part of space particle dualism?  
This hasn’t yet been shown in a rigorous way, but what we can say for sure is that it does only 
make sense in this theory, because an entropic expansion would be impossible in a universe with 
globally acting gravity.
