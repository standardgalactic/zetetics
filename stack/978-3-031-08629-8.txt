Preface
The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (1979) is a highly influential book by 
James J. Gibson that explains the ecological reasoning behind action and perception 
by referring to affordances as what the environment provides or furnishes to ani­
mals, for good or ill. Affordances are perceptions describing the complementarity 
between the physical structure of the environment and an animal’s capabilities for 
interaction. If affordances are generally conceived as a relationship between two 
adaptive and interacting systems, then the term gains broad applicability as it 
embodies and characterises interactability relevant to the biological, social and 
technical sciences. Perhaps for that reason, the concept has proven exceedingly 
valuable for fields outside ecological psychology. However, in its integration with 
other fields, the meaning and purpose of the term have been extended and moulded 
to fit the customs of these adapting fields.
It was with the aim to provide a better understanding of the development, the 
distinct meanings and the boundaries between various definitions of the term affor­
dance that this collection of essays has been established. In an age where the term 
has gained a greater amount of nuance and is being used in increasingly sophisti­
cated ways across disciplines, the present collection of essays provides what has not 
been attempted before, namely, an accessible overview of the concept’s application 
with limited-to-no field-specific jargon. In their personal essays, each contributor 
discusses either how affordances have served to understand a specific mechanism or 
phenomenon or how the concept has shaped or been applied throughout their 
careers. Thus, this book culminates in a short collection of easily-read essays that 
attempts to map how the widespread ecological concept has been applied, both 
theoretically and practically, in numerous disciplines.
The approach here is slightly different from most collections of essays and edited 
volumes. Most collections of essays focus on a single field, discussing several con­
cepts and directions within that same field – however, by having authors from a 
variety of backgrounds examine the same theme of affordances, this book takes a 
different approach, serving as a multidisciplinary catalyst to encourage students, 
designers and researchers of all levels to reconsider the application of the concept. 

vi
It is the hope that the essays’ accessibility will serve as motivation, provocation and 
inspiration for new ways to think about and apply the concept.
Although short, this collection of essays contains a total of 19 original contribu­
tions by excellent researchers with very different backgrounds. They have been cat­
egorized into seven sections ranging from philosophy, psychology and sociology to 
engineering, architecture and computer science to appreciate the potential of affor­
dances. Surely, this collection of essays does not cover all kinds of affordances. The 
reader is thus also invited to critically consider the essays and explore what other 
ways affordances can be applied. Hopefully, these essays will inspire the reader as 
much as they did to me, the editor.

This collection is inspired by discussions with colleagues and friends at the Situated 
Mobilities and Sensing Bodies research group from Aalborg University, the Berlin 
Mobile Brain/Body Imaging Lab at Technical University Berlin and numerous con­
ferences over the years. It is intended to be an interdisciplinary introduction to affor­
dances as James Gibson, who coined the term, wrote about it but also beyond. It is 
my hope that the readers are inspired by the essays and find a way to either apply 
affordances to their everyday lives and/or their research questions.

A Personal Introduction
Zakaria Djebbara
1.1  Introduction
As a student of architecture, nothing was as important to me as space. We studied 
intensely transformations of spaces, properties of materials, structural capacities of 
shapes, and the intersection between form and meaning. It was clear. To become an 
architect, you need to know how to design space. One of the many advantages of 
being an architect student is the many travels to different countries and cultures 
throughout your education. Three years into becoming an architect, we went to 
Japan for a month. I remember this journey vividly. I cannot think of a culture more 
distanced from my own than the Japanese culture. I was in for a serious culture 
shock. Everything, including door handles, seats, tables, stores, metro stations, 
handrails, urban structure, materials, forms, and shapes of buildings, was entirely 
different from what I knew. This was the first time I experienced an impact of this 
kind caused by the surrounding environment. Japan left me baffled and speech­
less—I wanted to understand this fantastical experience, but I did not have the tools. 
It was upon returning from Japan that I first encountered Lars Brorson Fich, an 
architect who has become a researcher, at the school of architecture. He is an archi­
tect of a different breed. After giving a fascinating lecture on his stress-related 
research based on an embodied framework (Fich et al., 2014; Damasio, 2010), it 
occurred to me that this was the first time in three and a half years that a lecture was 
devoted to the human body instead of the environment. This was radical! And he 
was clearly right. How could anyone put pen to paper and design the environment if 
they do not know the potential impact on the users?

Seeing architecture from his embodied perspective changed my mind and atti­
tude about what architecture is all about. Among my first realisations, I discovered 
that my interaction with and responses to space are automatic. I do not need to rea­
son about my sensations, actions, or experience of the space to decide on my behav­
iour or to form an opinion about it (Zajonc, 1980). My behaviour is invited and 
facilitated by the environmental features while my opinions are formed immedi­
ately upon perceiving the space. I know what environment best facilitates my con­
centration and I know which environment best facilities my hunger for socialising. 
But, as Lars Brorson Fich ensured, surprisingly little is known about how features 
of the designed space affect us experientially and behaviourally. Finally, I under­
stood that, indeed, to become an architect, you need to know how to design space—
however, to become a skilled architect, you need to know how to design experiences. 
The former pertains to the concrete and spatial, the latter to motion and time. I 
wanted to understand how the design of space can create experiences—I wanted to 
understand how space moves us. That was my call for research.
I entered research without the concept I needed to tie my fascination with how 
we sense and experience the world with the way environmental features automati­
cally invite specific behaviours. The first time I came across the concept of affor­
dance it was presented to me as the salient feature of either an object or the 
environment inviting a specific use or behaviour. It was associated with how the 
saliency of design of things could facilitate certain interactions, for example, the 
graspability of the handle of a teacup. We would say that the teacup affords being 
grasped. It was only when I read the original work by Gibson that I learned that the 
perspective I had read earlier was a design interpretation of the concept, mostly 
made popular by Don Norman in the design world (Norman, 2013). Gibsonian 
affordances are more general as they relate the living organism to its environment 
(Gibson, 1986). They are not specifically about the salient features of either an 
object or the environment—they encompass all of perception. To perceive, accord­
ing to Gibson, is the direct perception of the affordances of the environment relative 
to oneself.
To be clear, affordances are specified in the perceptual systems, which means 
that perceiving a door is not simply to sense parts and pieces, like the edges and 
shape, of the door and then put together a puzzle to form our perception but instead 
to directly perceive the door with its passability. Sensations are not considered indi­
vidual channels but interrelated perceptual systems that inform one another dynami­
cally in which affordances are revealed directly (Gibson, 1966). There is no need for 
higher cognitive processing to perceive the meaning and value of the environment—
it is readily there in the environment to be picked up. This may seem bewildering. 
How can affordances reveal themselves directly through the perceptual systems? 
There must be something about the perceptual systems that carry information con­
cerning affordances. To clarify, let us consider for instance Gibsonian optic array in 
visual perception.
Z. Djebbara

1.2  Information and Optic Array
First, it is important to note that affordances share an interesting similarity with 
counterfactuals. Counterfactuals concern the alternative outcomes contrary to the 
factual outcomes. They concern what-ifs. What if I had made a left turn much ear­
lier? What if I were to ride my bike slower over these bumpy cobblestones? What if 
I lay on the grass? Although a counterfactual thought need not be realistic, it shares 
with affordances the operation of considering alternative possibilities and their 
potential outcomes. However, to consider the realistic what-ifs, we must afford their 
possible interactions. Counterfactuals, incidentally, are precisely what characterise 
information. In her splendid book, The Science of Can and Can’t, Chiara Marletto 
(2021) dives much deeper into the relationship between counterfactuals and infor­
mation theory. However, in this introduction, I merely wish to emphasise that for 
anything to be informative, say for instance about the affordances of the environ­
ment, it needs to have one specific capacity and that is to be able to change between 
different states. Consider Morse Codes. Full sentences can be broadcasted by alter­
ing between sequences of long and short signal durations. To be informative, the 
medium essentially needs to be in one of at least two possible states.
Gibson firmly argued that his take on information has nothing to do with carrying 
nor transmitting information and so it is entirely different from the information-­
theoretic definition. His take is instead about seeking out and directly detecting 
features of the environment that are relevant to affordances. The information pickup 
is factual and physical. In his seminal book, he states:
The world does not speak to the observer. Animals and humans communicate with cries, 
gestures, speech, pictures, writing and television, but we cannot hope to understand percep­
tion in terms of these channels; it is quite the other way around. Words and pictures convey 
information, carry it, or transmit it, but the information in the sea of energy around each of 
us, luminous or mechanical or chemical energy, is not conveyed. It is simply there (Gibson, 
1986, p. 242).
To understand this view, we need to return to one of the most important insights of 
Gibson’s ecological approach, namely, his critique of the concept of stimulus. 
Gibson disregarded the existence of stimulus as a discrete, individual package—
instead, our interaction with the world is continuous and temporally extended. The 
word stimulus presumes that it is temporally and spatially distinguishable from the 
stimulus immediately before and after it, which would mean accepting that there is 
an instantaneous transition from one stimulus to another followed by a static 
sequence of responses. This did not sit well with Gibson. Instead, he suggested that 
there is a flowing array of energy with overlapping and interpenetrating stimuli and 
responses occluding one another. The stimulus of any moment in time is never iso­
lated or detached from the preceding and incoming array of stimuli—neither are the 
responses. There is a temporal dimension associated with the array of stimuli, and 
they continuously change based on body activity, brain activity, and the surrounding 
environment. But how is this related to the affordances in the optic array, you 
may wonder.
1  A Personal Introduction

4
The optic array describes the arrangement of light angles, structured by the sur­
faces in the environment given a source of light, that hit the retina at a point of 
observation. When we move through the environment, there is a continuous per­
spectival change of the environment, where parts of the optic arrays will either 
remain variant or invariant, revealing the possible transformation of the detected 
surfaces. For instance, the expansion of a form specifies that it is (or you are) 
approaching, whereas the contraction of the form specifies that it is (or you are) 
receding. Another example is that if a detected texture disappears close to a detected 
contour, we perceive that as a surface being concealed behind an occluding edge. 
Notice here that we are not referring to the actual state of the angles, but to how they 
change. It is in this continuous transformation of optic arrays that our perception of 
the environment becomes the detection of invariant features in the environment 
through time and motion.
If the optic array in the environment presents us with variants and invariants, our 
perception of the environment then depends on the alteration between more than a 
single possible state that the optic arrays can take. Our automatic responses to 
numerous feature detections rest on this capacity provided by the optic array—they 
are revealed in the way perceptual systems change in time. Both invariance and vari­
ance in the optic array carry information of the environment, but both invariance and 
variance are concepts only evaluable under temporal change. For us to know that 
something is invariant, it must not change in time, while that which is variant needs 
to change in time.
We now have an informative medium with which we can resonate and tune into 
our environment. The environment itself is the medium of information in this case. 
Surely, with an optic array of this nature, it is clear that we need little to no involve­
ment from higher cognitive capacities to mediate our perception of the affordances 
in the surrounding environment. We are, in other words, directly attuned to the 
invariant information in the environment. The information pickup is not carrying 
static content per se but carries changing information for affordances. As you will 
encounter throughout this collection of essays, there are different opinions about the 
relationship between affordances and information—this is but my personal view.
1.3  Movement and Time
As it turns out, there is more in the change of things than in things themselves. We 
perceive the affordances of the environment because of how things change, that is, 
how the detected invariant features transform in time and motion. Numerous other 
thinkers have suggested the tight link between time, movement, and human percep­
tion. Particularly in his creative dissertation An Essay on the Immediate Data of 
Consciousness from 1889, Henri Bergson (2001) made an original contribution to 
our understanding of time and motion. Without diving too deep into his concepts 
and ideas, I wish to merely highlight his view of how human experience as a process 
of becoming through movement.
Z. Djebbara

His main aim in his dissertation was to disentangle space and time as a response 
to Immanuel Kant. To Bergson, space and time hold different properties that char­
acterise them. Space is that which is infinitely divisible. Anything in space can be 
continuously divided in the very same sense as infinite geometric series; a cube can 
be divided in half and juxtaposed infinitely. But time is different. Time is that which 
is indivisible. Any moment of time cannot be divided and juxtaposed with another 
moment of time without spatialising time. Space allows juxtaposing and externalis­
ing one from another in a homogeneous space, whereas time consists of a temporal 
heterogeneity where experience gradually becomes richer in content, making any 
two moments incomparable. To differ in time is to differ in kind. To differ in space 
is to differ in degree. You may wonder how these insights are related to movement 
and experience.
Movement belongs to both space and time, but in different ways (Bergson, 2007). 
From our quantitative, spatial transformation of the body follows a qualitative, tem­
poral duration of our experience. But to Bergson, movement is indivisible, similar 
to time. Movement has duration, which, for Bergson, is the continuity of progress 
with which comes heterogeneity. Therefore, it is through movement that we experi­
ence the world and continuously become. All the depths and heterogeneous quality 
of human experience become through the movement of the body in time, so that, in 
short, through movement experience becomes.
1.4  Enactive Account
Emphasising movement leads us to the circularity found in perception and action, 
which will essentially lead us to the importance of the relationship between the 
brain, body, and environment. This circular structure of embodiment, where move­
ment causes new perceptions and perception affords new movements, is critical to 
the enactivist movement, which has several similarities with both Bergson’s and 
Gibson’s ecological psychology. It was Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and 
Eleanor Rosch (2016) who coined the term enactivism, which refers, somewhat 
similar to both Bergson and Gibson, to the fact that living organisms participate in 
the process of generating meaning as they engage in the transformation of the world. 
It is hard to imagine a world in which our actions and perceptions do not form a 
symmetric relationship.
In brief, enactivism promotes a view of human experience as meaningful activity 
in the world; it is a continuous process of sense-making manifested in self-­sustaining 
neuronal, bodily, and sensorimotor dynamics resonating under far-from-equilibrium 
circumstances. This view essentially borrows several concepts from nonlinear 
dynamics, network theory, and generally complex systems. What typically charac­
terises complex systems is that they emerge from the collective behaviour of their 
parts in ways that are difficult to infer from the properties of their parts alone—that 
is, we cannot understand human behaviour nor experience by merely studying either 
the brain, the body, or the environment in isolation. The critical argument is that it 
1  A Personal Introduction

is not only local states that can affect global states—global states can also affect 
local states in a downward causal manner (Thompson, 2007). It is for this reason 
that enactivism appeals to a more expansive account where the capacities of the liv­
ing organism emerge from the interaction between the brain, body, and environment.
One particularly interesting framework that subsumes enactivism under their 
paradigm is the advocates of predictive processing in their attempt to construct a 
more unified theory of the brain through a free energy principle (Clark, 2015). The 
argument of downward causation in enactivism is interpreted as the capacity to 
actively generate predictions, based on Bayesian optimisation and an information-­
theoretic approach, about the states of the world (Friston, 2010). There are several 
incompatibilities between enactivism and predictive processing that are worth look­
ing into for the interested reader (Di Paolo et al., 2022).
Despite the emphasis on the brain, body, and environment, I was not ready to 
assign equal importance to the triad in all situations. Several findings suggest that 
lesions in the brain of impaired patients lead to robust changes in experience and 
behaviour. In addition, weighing approximately 2% of the average body weight, the 
brain consumes about 20% of the body’s energy. This is nature’s way of stating that 
this organ is doing something important. This was also appreciated by Varela as he 
continued to pursue a systems approach to neuroscience where Thompson and he 
argued that we can learn more about the brain’s role in behaviour and experience 
from the large-scale network dynamics and synchronisations than from particular 
classes or circuits of neurons (Thompson & Varela, 2001). Systems neuroscience 
has ever since grown into a branch that emphasises the interaction of neuronal struc­
tures in networks that impact sensorimotor control and information processing 
(Sporns, 2011). These interactions provide us with a framework from which to 
understand how brain structures and functions work together to create behaviour.
1.5  Enactive Neuroscience?
With that said, I realised that I needed to create experiments that allow the monitor­
ing of the brain, body, and environment so they could later be analysed in tandem. 
By additionally allowing my participants to freely move around, I could obtain what 
Klaus Gramann and his colleagues (2014) have referred to as natural cognition—
that is, ecologically valid experimental setups where the participant acts and in 
which we monitor the brain, body, and environment. Bingo! This approach, mobile 
brain/body imaging, was aligning with the view I had built up about human behav­
iour and experience. On the brain side of things, we essentially arrive at the humble 
beginnings of what might be named enactive or ecological neuroscience (Parada & 
Rossi, 2020). After a short one-day visit to Klaus Gramann’s laboratory in Berlin, I 
realised that this is our current best shot at uncovering the relations between brain, 
body, and environment, and I had to learn from him and his enthusiastic team for at 
least half a year. In collaborating with Klaus Gramann, we managed to design an

experiment that questions the role of affordances in the processes relevant to action 
and perception as expounded by the enactive theory.
Combining virtual reality with an electroencephalogram, we designed three dif­
ferent doors with each their afforded passability (Djebbara et al., 2019). The task 
was then to simply pass through the door and collect a reward from the other room. 
Two of the doors, although different in width, were passable; however, the third 
door was impossible to pass. It was simply too narrow to fit the body through—in 
other words, it did not afford a pass or passage. Analysing the moment they per­
ceived which door they had to pass led to surprising results. It turns out that the 
affordances of the environment are reflected in early visual processes and motor-­
related processes. The analyses show that the door that was impossible to pass was 
processed significantly different from the other two doors, whereas these two other 
doors did not significantly differ from one another.
It also turns out that during the interaction with the doors, a specific frequency 
band reflected the affordances of the door over the sensorimotor regions (Djebbara 
et al., 2021). This suggests that the responses varying as a function of the affor­
dances of the door were not only early responses. They were in fact continuous and 
persisted throughout the interaction. When we design spaces, we should be aware 
that architecture is designed to a great extent in time and expectation and not just 
space alone. The ongoing sensory dynamics can, in fact, alter behaviour in auto­
matic and implicit ways that escape our conscious attention (Djebbara et al., 2022). 
In a way, our interactive skills are relying, to a great extent, on our expected sensory 
dynamics, which in turn are designed by an architect. Are architects affecting our 
everyday behaviour and experience? Indeed, they are. Are we directly perceiving 
affordances? I am not sure. These results suggest that there may be some hold to this 
view as affordances are reflected in early perceptual processes, but we are merely at 
the beginning of uncovering the relations.
1.6  Final Thoughts
In closing, I want to remind the reader of my ambition to become a skilled architect 
that understands how space moves us. I have yet to succeed for two reasons. First, 
on a large scale, the concept of affordances helped me answer how architecture is 
related to human experience and behaviour. This was relevant as architecture is in 
part about shaping the world so that it fits our physical structure and functional 
needs. Affordances are what one can do, not what one must do. Surely, certain fea­
tures of the environment may feel more inviting than others. For example, a chair 
may invite you to sit while staircases may invite you to climb them. But, in essence, 
affordances present us with meaningful possibilities for action and because some 
affordances can feel more inviting than others, the environment can be thought of as 
a landscape of attractors that, when under the right exploratory circumstances, 
moves us and consequently designs our experience of space through a trajectory of 
movements. While the journey towards neuroscience provided me with some 
1  A Personal Introduction

concepts and tools to better understand the relationship between experience and 
behaviour, I have not yet been able to uncover on a smaller scale how we automati­
cally adapt to the environment and what these adaptations mean for our experience 
and capacities. How exactly does the bodily interaction with designed space affect 
the trajectory of our inner flowing of experience?
Second, during my pursuit, I have been ambushed by the fascinating thoughts 
and complex approaches of several giant thinkers in the history of philosophy, psy­
chology, and science. How they write passionately about their topic, dedicate sev­
eral years to answer questions that become deeply personal, and intertwine and 
inspire each other while providing original insights have altogether irreversibly 
inspired me. Here I acknowledge that I have essentially failed as I no longer wish to 
become “the skilled architect” as much as I wish to dedicate myself to unravelling 
questions deeply rooted in my personal wondering and to contribute to our collec­
tive story we call science. I wish to dedicate my time and energy to advancing our 
understanding of how architecture is related to experience—in a way, how space is 
related to time.

2.1  Introduction
Much of human daily life is taken up with performing skilled activities in which we 
engage with the affordances the social, cultural, material, and natural environment 
provides. Activities as varied as driving, eating, performing surgery, talking, and 
making works of art can be understood in terms of skilled engagement with affor­
dances. Affordances are possibilities for action provided to us by the environment—
by substances, surfaces, objects, and living creatures that surround us (Chemero, 
2009; Gibson, 1979; Heft, 2001; Stoffregen, 2003). The concept of affordances 
applies not only to humans, but to all living organisms, as we all share the fate of 
being inescapably surrounded by our surroundings.
This broad applicability of ecological psychology and its focus on action is 
shared by enactivism, an approach to cognition that focuses on the dynamic interac­
tions between an acting organism and its environment. The Skilled Intentionality 
Framework (SIF) is a philosophical approach that combines insights from both

ecological psychology and enactivism to understand the embodied and situated 
mind. With SIF there is the long-term ambition to provide a conceptual framework 
that applies across the board; to all living organisms, from mollusks to mammals, 
and to all types of behavior, including so-called higher cognition and collective 
action. SIF radically extends the scope of affordance theory and in doing so aims to 
offer a parsimonious account of cognition that provides a sound philosophical foun­
dation for understanding the relation between people and their living environment 
and, moreover, is relevant for neuroscience, biology, the humanities, and the social 
sciences alike. The aim of this essay is to provide an overview of SIF and the role 
that affordances play in it. Skilled intentionality is the selective engagement with 
multiple affordances simultaneously, which puts affordances and the responsive­
ness to them at the heart of SIF.
A cup affords grasping by us, mostly by virtue of physical facts concerning the 
size and shape of our hands and cups. However, it is possible to explain so much 
more than just mechanical action routines using affordances if we understand how 
affordances are related to sociocultural practices. For example, it makes a difference 
whether a cup is yours or mine: I will be invited by the possibility of drinking from 
mine but not from yours. Crucially, we propose that it is possible to understand all 
skillful action in terms of engagement with affordances. To accomplish this the SIF 
proposes a broad definition of affordances as relations between (a) aspects of the 
sociomaterial environment in flux and (b) abilities available in a form of life (Rietveld 
& Kiverstein, 2014).
Using this definition allows for an analysis of affordances on multiple scales 
(e.g., their invitational character for a particular individual as well as the affordances 
available in a given sociocultural practice) while simultaneously bridging these lev­
els to provide an integrated account of the embodied and situated human mind (this 
will become clear below). Our aim in this essay is to showcase these strengths of 
SIF and more generally the strengths of a philosophy of affordances that takes our 
human situatedness in a social, cultural, material, and natural environment seri­
ously. In particular, first we will discuss the landscape of affordances as our ecologi­
cal niche. Then we discuss the experience of an individual in a niche structured by 
affordances. In the third part, we discuss the interrelation of the individual and niche 
in terms of affordances. And we end by looking at the dynamics within an individ­
ual, namely the bodily states of action readiness that affordances can evoke.
2.2  The Landscape of Affordances as Our Ecological Niche
The aforementioned definition of affordances uses the Wittgensteinian notion of a 
form of life (1953), which refers to “the relatively stable and regular patterns of 
activity found among individuals taking part in a practice or a custom” (Kiverstein 
et al., 2019). The reason to use form of life in the definition of affordances is to be 
able to account for the highly specialized and varied abilities that humans can 
embody by being part of particular sociocultural practices. While for most purposes

it seems reasonable to characterize the abilities of all members of the earthworm 
species as a single set, this approach fails for humans, as the skillsets of different 
individuals, e.g., neurosurgeons and Maasai hunters, vary strongly (see Ingold, 
2000). Form of life can thus refer to both sociocultural practices (e.g., those of neu­
rosurgeons or hunters) and to species (e.g., earthworms, kangaroos, humans).
With regard to the environment in which people and other animals are situated, 
Kiverstein et al. (2019) proposed to distinguish between the level of the individual 
and the level of a form of life. At the level of a form of life we can characterize the 
ecological niche as a landscape of affordances. A core idea of the SIF is that the 
landscape of affordances that surrounds humans is incredibly rich, richer than is 
generally assumed (Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). It is not just that a cup affords 
grasping; a sad friend affords comforting, this page affords being described cor­
rectly as white, a surgical room affords a surgeon to do an operation, and a bow and 
arrow afford the hunter to shoot. Moreover, as affordances are defined relative to a 
form of life, the existence of affordances is not dependent on the individual. The 
landscape of affordances is as stable as the patterns of behavior that form our prac­
tices. The landscape thus is a stable, shared environment for individuals inhabiting 
a form of life (see Fig. 2.1a).
The rich human landscape of affordances arises due to the similarly rich relata of 
our definition of affordances: environmental aspects and abilities available in the 
form of life. We already touched upon the variety in human abilities; the wide vari­
ety of human sociocultural practices entails many different abilities that can be 
available to human individuals. The other relatum, the environmental aspects, come 
in even greater variety and are in the human case best understood as being thor­
oughly sociomaterial due to the intertwinement of the material and the social in 
Fig. 2.1  Sketches of landscape and field of affordances, which are relative to a form of life and to 
an individual, respectively. Note that the landscape and field are both dynamic (see main text). The 
field and landscape stand in mutual and reciprocal dependence to one another (Kiverstein 
et al., 2019)

practice (van Dijk & Rietveld, 2017). As humans we are embedded in sociocultural 
practices, which means that also the material structures around us have been shaped 
by cultural practices. Wherever you are now, look around and you will see particular 
objects in particular places, both those objects themselves and the places they are in 
have been formed by social practices (e.g., this shows itself in that we tend not to 
put mugs on top of keyboards or keyboards on chairs).
As both our abilities and our environments come about through sociocultural 
practices, it follows that the landscape of affordances for humans is also fundamen­
tally social. The possibilities for action we have depend on the sociocultural prac­
tices, i.e., forms of life, we are part of. For example, as part of the sociocultural 
practice of speaking English, we have the possibility to judge the arguments in this 
text, to imagine how it could be structured differently, to read out these words aloud, 
etc. The landscape of affordances in this way reflects the abilities that arise from our 
practices.
These abilities that arise from our practices include those related to so-called 
higher cognition, such as judging the arguments in this text. While research in 
embodied cognition has mostly focused on sensorimotor skills, we contend that 
responsiveness to affordances is not limited to repeating mechanically some rou­
tine, but is flexible in a context-sensitive way. The orthodox dichotomy of so-called 
higher and lower cognition hence plays no role in the SIF; all skilled behavior is 
viewed as engaging with multiple affordances, enabling the analysis of all forms of 
behavior in one framework. This includes activities such as reflecting, judging, 
imagining, verbalizing, planning, and more (Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2018; Kolvoort 
et al., 2021; Van Den Herik & Rietveld, 2021; van Dijk & Rietveld, 2021a, b).
We can think of higher cognition as part of temporally extended activities in 
which we coordinate with nested affordances in an environment structured by a 
complex constellation of sociomaterial practices (Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2018; van 
Dijk & Rietveld, 2021a).
Crucially, using the form of life as the level of analysis allowed the development 
of a Wittgensteinian notion of situated normativity to describe the normative aspect 
of cognition in skillful action (Rietveld, 2008). Situated normativity describes the 
normative dimension of the things we do in real-life contexts. In every concrete situ­
ation, an individual distinguishes between better or worse possibilities for action. 
For humans, this is strongly dependent on the sociocultural practices in which our 
actions are embedded; whether some action is adequate (or good, correct, etc.) or 
not is dependent in part upon agreement in action among members of a sociocul­
tural practice (Wittgenstein, 1953). While dancing might be laudable within the 
confines of a nightclub, it might not be so when engaging in the practice of listening 
to a client’s presentation at a company’s office.

2.3  Individual Experience of Affordances
We have discussed that we can describe the ecological niche as a landscape of affor­
dances on the level of a form of life. An important question is how an individual 
engages with this landscape. As the landscape of affordance is relative to a whole 
form of life, this question narrows to: How does an individual selectively engage 
with affordances that are relevant to them in their current situation? If we walk into 
a cafeteria looking for a place to sit and eat our lunch, we tend not to be over­
whelmed by the myriad of possibilities that the chairs, tables, and people in the 
cafeteria afford us. In such a situation, we tend to be drawn in, or solicited, only by 
aspects of the cafeteria that will allow us to sit down and eat.
In SIF solicitations are distinguished from affordances (Rietveld, 2008; Rietveld 
& Kiverstein, 2014), where solicitations are those affordances that are experienced 
as relevant by a situated individual. So these solicitations or relevant affordances 
are to be analyzed at the level of the individual, while available affordances and 
their existence belong at the level of a form of life.
What makes one affordance relevant but not another? SIF avoids the groundless 
use of goals or tasks and instead argues for a process of self-organization as the 
source of relevance (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). All organisms tend toward a 
state of relative equilibrium in the dynamic coupling between their body and the 
world via “self-organized compensatory activity” (Merleau-Ponty, 2003). It is this 
tendency that imbues some affordances with relevancy but not others and the SIF 
characterizes this tendency as a tendency toward better grip on the situation. It is 
those affordances that allow us to improve our grip on the situation that are relevant. 
Which is why in the previous example we are solicited by what an empty chair 
affords in a cafeteria, but not by the affordances of chairs with occupants.
However, in real-life we do not engage with only one affordance at a time, Skilled 
Intentionality implies a responsiveness to multiple affordances simultaneously. We 
refer to the constellation of affordances that are relevant or inviting to an individual 
engaging with a concrete situation as the field of relevant affordances (Fig. 2.1b; 
Rietveld et al., 2018; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). The inviting affordances of the 
field are part of the lived experience of an individual (Withagen et al., 2012), and it 
is opened up out of the landscape, by their abilities and concerns in the concrete 
situation. This experience of a situation inviting behavior goes together with a 
bodily state that has been referred to as “action readiness” in emotion psychology 
(Frijda, 2007), that is, the body poises itself for active engagement with relevant 
affordances.
Although the landscape of affordances is in flux when considered over larger 
timescales, the field of relevant affordances is an even more dynamic and ever-­
changing phenomenon. When an individual acts or when the situation itself devel­
ops, the individual–environment relation is changed and other solicitations arise 
(Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). What is foreground and what is background shifts 
continuously, the field is in flux over shorter timescales. Crucially, the individual is 
responsive to field of relevant affordances as a whole. For example, while attending 
2  Affordances for Situating the Embodied Mind in Sociocultural Practice

18
a presentation, we can be responsive to what is afforded by our cup coffee and the 
speaker at the same time. And the relevance of what either affords can change due 
to our own actions (e.g., finishing the coffee, raising our hand) or by the changing 
environment (a colleague walking in, the presentation ending). Often it will be that 
being poised for multiple relevant affordances simultaneously allows for an 
improvement in grip, because it enables one to flexibly and rapidly respond to 
changes in the environment (Bruineberg et al., 2021).
2.4  The Individual Entangled with the Form of Life: Fields 
and Landscape as Continuing Process
Now that we have discussed the landscape and field of affordances, we can turn our 
eye to their complex and dynamic interrelationship. While we can conceptually 
distinguish shared publicly available affordances and those relevant affordances that 
invite a situated agent to act, they should not be separated on ontological grounds 
(Kiverstein et al., 2019). Such an ontological separation would violate the recipro­
cal and mutual dependence of the landscape and field. This violation becomes clear 
when we appreciate the fact that while the landscape of affordances incorporates 
physical and material structure, it is not the reality as described in physics. Instead, 
the landscape of affordances is pragmatically structured by patterns of regular activ­
ity available in an ecological niche or form of life.
For example, while it is indeed a physical matter that we are supported by the 
floor of a post office, that we often form a single file queue is not just a physical 
matter (as the physical space would allow a group to stand in a myriad of configura­
tions), but it is a matter of sociocultural practices, in this case the practice of queu­
ing. Queueing is a practice, it is a pattern of regular activity available in a form of 
life (one that most of us inhabit), hence it is part of the landscape of affordances. 
However, from the perspective of the individual, queueing is also an act, it is an 
individual engaging with a relevant affordance. This points us toward the reality that 
practices and affordances are different perspectives on the same thing. The practice 
of queueing consists out of individuals who tend toward better grip on their situa­
tions by engaging with the affordance to queue. When we take the perspective of 
one individual who enters the post office, the other individuals queueing form part 
of the sociomaterial structure around her, constraining her field of relevant affor­
dances. On the other hand, when she joins the queue, she engages with the practice 
of queueing that is part of the public landscape of affordances available to all the 
people there.
We chose the example of queueing because of its physicality, as one person 
queueing (engaging with a relevant affordance) in a very physical sense is both part 
of a practice (landscape) and a relevant affordance for another person (field), who 
can queue physically behind her. In a very direct sense the material structure of the 
landscape (a queue) is here entangled with patterns of an individual’s activity. 
However, this mutuality of practices and affordances is not restricted to physical 
I. R. Kolvoort and E. Rietveld

19
(material or temporal) contiguity. For instance, the contours of streets have been 
shaped by practices of people traveling in different ways (e.g., by foot or car) and 
by builders placing things in certain places (e.g., traffic lights, sidewalks, buildings), 
which determine the structure of the landscape for everyone who travels that street, 
even decades later.
From these examples we can learn that practices and affordances are perspec­
tives on the same sociomaterial entanglement of people, activities, places, and 
things. Moreover, activities are related to practices in a fundamental sense (van Dijk 
& Rietveld, 2017). The practice of queueing exists by virtue of individual acts of 
queueing. The landscape of affordances is formed partly by a history of individual 
(or joint) activities and continues to take shape as practices unfold. On the other side 
of the coin, we have that individual acts of queueing depend on the existence of the 
practice of queueing. The field of relevant affordances opens up out of the landscape.
This reciprocal dependence between the landscape and field of affordances 
necessitates a view in which an ongoing process shapes the landscape and field 
together (Kiverstein et al., 2019; van Dijk & Rietveld, 2021a). This ongoing process 
is comprised of the activity of individuals: Individuals, enacting relevant affor­
dances, simultaneously shape their field of relevant affordances as well as contribut­
ing to sociomaterial practices that shape the landscape of affordances (which in turn 
will shape the future history of activity of individuals). This process view points 
toward a temporal view on the relation between the landscape and field of affor­
dances (Kiverstein et al., 2019). On short time scales, the more stable landscape 
constrains the affordances available in the more dynamic field. For instance, the 
affordance to queue when one gets to the post office is made possible by existence 
of the practice of queueing, which exists on a larger temporal scale than a particular 
individual engaging with the affordance to queue. Over longer periods of time, how­
ever, the landscape depends on the field of relevant affordances. Practices are main­
tained over time by the inviting character of affordances leading to activities 
constitutive of the practice. The practice of queueing is maintained by virtue of the 
soliciting character of the affordance to queue to individuals. Individuals queueing 
keep the practice of queueing “alive.” In this way,the field, which invites individuals 
to act in concrete situations, is “at the forefront” of the evolving landscape, continu­
ing it through time, maintaining it how it is, or evolving it in new directions 
(Kiverstein et al., 2019; van Dijk & Rietveld, 2021a). Kiverstein, Van Dijk, and 
Rietveld offer the example of musicians making jazz: “the affordances of musical 
instruments to make jazz music depends upon musicians that know the history of 
jazz, and can maintain this history whilst also building on it through their own 
improvisations.” (2019, p. 2293).
It is important to note that some of the real-world examples we discussed above 
(e.g., queueing) can perhaps be considered somewhat trivial. These examples were 
chosen to be familiar and accessible, but considering our claim that all skillful activ­
ities can be understood in terms of engaging with affordances, one can expect SIF 
to be able to do more. One (not so familiar) example of applying the SIF is the 
analysis of the field of relevant affordances of patients receiving deep brain stimula­
tion (De Haan et al., 2013). More generally, to understand complex and temporally 
2  Affordances for Situating the Embodied Mind in Sociocultural Practice

20
extended engagements in terms of affordances requires the methods of embedded 
philosophy and longer-term ethnographic observation. Examples of using these 
methods combined with the SIF include the practices of psychiatry (van Westen 
et al., 2019, 2021), visual art, and architecture (Rietveld & Brouwers, 2017; van 
Dijk & Rietveld, 2021a, b).
2.5  Within the Individual
So far we have regarded an individual’s actions and the dynamics of a developing 
situation as impacting the individual–environment relation, but the SIF also con­
nects these phenomena with the ongoing dynamics within an individual’s body and 
brain. Employing principles from the complex and dynamical systems literature, the 
SIF relates phenomenology and ecological psychology to developments in theoreti­
cal neurobiology (see Bruineberg et al., 2018; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014, 2019).
The improvement of grip on a situation can be characterized as the reduction of 
disequilibrium in the brain–body–landscape of affordances dynamical system. 
Organisms selectively engage with those affordances that reduce their disequilib­
rium with the environment. The SIF views this disequilibrium as a dis-attunement 
between internal and external dynamics, i.e., between self-organizing affordance-­
related states of action-readiness in the individual and the changing landscape of 
affordances (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). It is this dis-attunement that as a most 
basic concern drives organisms to selectively engage with relevant affordances. On 
SIF’s view, Friston’s Free Energy Principle (2010) is all about improving grip on the 
field of affordances; a reduction in free energy is a reduction in dis-attunement of 
internal and external dynamics (Bruineberg et  al., 2018; Bruineberg & 
Rietveld, 2014).
Importantly, this conceptual scheme allows for cross-fertilization between disci­
plines: the study of activity in the brain and body can inform and be informed by 
investigations of an individual’s landscape of affordances (including the embedding 
sociomaterial practices, which can be investigated well by means of ethnography, 
see van Dijk & Rietveld, 2021a) and the structure of the field of relevant affordances 
(which incorporates the individual’s abilities and can be investigated by means of 
phenomenological interviews, see, e.g., De Haan et al., 2013). Overall, we contend 
that to understand the situated mind, we need to regard the whole system “brain–
body–landscape of affordances.”

Chapter 3
Affordances and the Logic of the Gift
Madeline Donald and Jelle Bruineberg
3.1  Introduction
All that is afforded to us by our environments is thanks to Land,1 the beings, assem­
blages, and relationships that make ongoing life possible. In this chapter, we offer a 
reflection on how affordance theories portray Land relations and how thinking with 
Indigenous philosophies of the gift could help anchor these relations beyond human 
life-affirming practices.
Both authors of this piece are presently (re)configuring their relationship to 
Land. Madeline Donald is in the Okanagan watershed, learning with the Land and 
the peoples of the Land that daily make her life possible. Born a visitor in Coast 
Miwok territory and raised a traveler, she developed as a student and researcher of 
human–plant perception. Madeline recently moved from the Netherlands to Canada, 
a nation-state that welcomes her as a citizen by passport, whiteness, and probable 
economic utility. This was an intentional move back to stolen Land derived from a 
desire to think and work with(in) settler colonial trouble while conducting a PhD 
project in support of the Land’s well-being.
1 We choose here to capitalize Land. Capitalized, this concept encompases not only a material, ter­
restrial understanding of land but “all the stuff that makes a place a place and not another place, 
from spirits down to dirt” (Liborion in Harp & Callison, 2021).

Jelle Bruineberg, a philosopher of cognition working on affordances, was set to 
migrate from the Netherlands, the country in which he was born and lived in for the 
majority of his life, to Australia when the pandemic made international flights 
impossible. For the last 18  months, he has been working remotely from the 
Netherlands. His (re)configuration to Land came to the fore when he organized a 
workshop. As is policy at Macquarie University, any workshop starts with an 
Acknowledgment to Country, a brief ceremony that acknowledges the traditional 
custodians of the Land on which Macquarie is based: the Wallumattagal clan of the 
Dharug nation. Speaking from a houseboat in the Netherlands, having never been to 
Australia, he struggled to find a way to sincerely acknowledge the custodians of 
Land that felt so abstract and far away.
Our irregular conversations began some years ago with a discussion of the poten­
tial use of the term affordance in ethnoecology. Bruineberg had written his disserta­
tion on affordances in embodied cognitive science (Bruineberg, 2018) and Donald 
chanced across the phrase after conducting research into human use of non-crop 
plants in and around Trinidad’s cacao agroforestry systems (Donald, 2019). 
Affordances, the possibilities perceived by a form of life for interaction with the 
surrounding environment, she realized, could be a symbolic container for human–
plant interaction. Soon, however, the concept of affordance itself came under scru­
tiny in our conversations. What conceptual baggage comes along (explicitly or 
implicitly) with the notion of affordance? What kind of relationship to Land does it 
signify?
3.2  Affordance Theory and Extraction
James Gibson (1979) characterizes affordances in the following way: “[t]he affor­
dances of the environment are what it offers the animal” (p. 127), e.g., the house 
offers shelter. There is a relational element implied by this view of affordances. 
Depending on their size, shape, and needs, shelter is not offered to all animals 
equally: affordances are just there as resources of the environment relative to a par­
ticular animal.
To describe the intentional relationship between animals and affordances, the 
term solicitation is introduced (cf. Withagen et al., 2012). Solicitations are those 
affordances that invite engagement. In Gibson’s (1979) chapter “The Theory of 
Affordances,” he approvingly quotes Koffka: “Each thing says what it is. ... a fruit 
says ‘Eat me’; water says ‘Drink me’; thunder says ‘Fear me’; and woman says 
‘Love me.’” (p. 138). “The object offers what it does because it is what it is” (p. 139), 
Gibson writes; each thing calls out to be used. Although the relationship between 
Koffka’s notion of demand character and Gibson’s notion of affordance is complex, 
this is a crucial insight that Gibson retains.
Combining these two ideas, affordances as available resources, and solicitations 
as calling out for use, there emerges a problem. Coming from the environmental 
humanities, Gibson’s assertion reads as an expression of extractive logic: 
M. Donald and J. Bruineberg

25
paraphrasing Koffka: “World says: exploit me.” Extractive logic reinforces the idea 
of uni-­directional offering, a taking without reciprocity; humans can use the affor­
dances of the environment as they see fit (Shapiro & McNeish, 2021). Moreover, 
Koffka’s quote easily reads as an externalization of responsibility: “forest says ‘cut 
me,’” “coal says, ‘burn me.’” “Each thing says what it is” (Koffka, as quoted in 
Gibson, 1979, p. 148), a resource to be used. We are currently witnessing the ongo­
ing horrors of these logics of extraction: deforestation, skyrocketing greenhouse gas 
concentrations, and ecological degradation. Recent authors have tied the ideologies 
in which such extractive practices are rooted to colonialization and rape culture 
(Bowman, 2017; Davis & Todd, 2017; Holmes et al., 2015).
Is ecological psychology, and its notion of affordance, really so intimately linked 
with a logic of extraction? We are not sure. Some ecological psychologists have 
stressed that the direct, unmediated perceptual availability of affordances easily 
slips into taking for granted the availability of affordances in the world (i.e., Costall, 
1999; Van Dijk, 2021). In other words, it is important to distinguish between the 
claim that affordances are independent of mental activity and the (problematic) 
claim that affordances are independent of any sort of activity. Our point is that if 
affordances are portrayed as always already being in the environment, lying ready 
for use, then that theory of affordance and solicitation easily slips into the logic of 
extraction. We think it is both worthwhile and possible to preserve what is important 
about a theory of affordances while grounding it in alternative logics. In this sense, 
our chapter should be read more as a call for vigilance than as a diagnosis of the 
current theory landscape.
As an example of non-extractive affordance relationships we borrow insights 
from Rauna Kuokkanen’s (2007a, b; Sami) articulation of a “logic of the gift” and 
two Indigenous2 creation stories, one Syilx and one shared by many Indigenous 
Australian peoples. These three teachings share an underlying ethic of gratitude and 
reciprocity from which we believe affordance theories have much to learn.
3.3  Toward an Alternative Logic
Rauna Kuokkanen (2007b) writes of “the gift logic of Indigenous philosophies,”3 
logics of responsibility and reciprocity that characterize Indigenous Land ethics 
around the world. What might a more ontologically flexible theory of affordances 
look like if grounded in “a perception of the natural environment as a living entity 
2 The term Indigenous refers to communities of people who are of a place; as Melissa Nelson 
(2008) has written, “we cannot be separated from these places … we become one, literally and 
metaphorically, with our homelands and territories” (p. 10). The word in English is a product of 
settler colonialism and distinguishes settlers from those whose Land we/they occupy.
3 While drawing out similarities between different Indigenous philosophies to articulate “the gift 
logic,” Kuokkanen (2007a) is careful to explain that articulating and learning from these similari­
ties do not diminish the diversity of Indigenous philosophies around the world.

which gives its gifts and abundance to people if it is treated with respect and grati­
tude” (ibid., p. 71, emphasis added)?
In his book “Why Indigenous Literatures Matter” (Justice, 2018), writer, thinker, 
and professor Daniel Justice (Cherokee Nation) explains how relationality, and par­
ticularly the oft-cited concept of “all my relations,” is inextricable from a logic of 
the gift. Justice cites Robin Wall Kimmerrer (2013; Citizen Potawatomi Nation):
Cultures of gratitude must also be cultures of reciprocity. Each person, human or no, is 
bound to every other in a reciprocal relationship. Just as all beings have a duty to me, I have 
a duty to them. If an animal gives its life to feed me, I am in turn bound to support its life. 
If I receive a stream’s gift of pure water, then I am responsible for returning a gift in kind. 
An integral part of a human’s education is to know those duties and how to perform 
them. (p. 87)
“If we don’t know these duties,” Justice goes on to explain, “it’s part of our ethical 
obligation to learn them, and to express them in a way that makes possible better, 
healthier, more respectful relations” (p. 87). How might we hold this obligation in 
relation to a theory of affordances?
We wish for a theory of affordances in which respect and gratitude are funda­
mental relational necessities, a theory that can support and affirm life and livelihood 
in complex multi-species assemblages. While cautioning against the pervasive 
extractive tendencies of the euro-centric academy, Doleen Manning (2017; 
Anishinaabe) clarifies the importance of engaging with Indigenous philosophies: 
“These urgently needed alternatives provide a ground from which we can imagine 
other ways of thinking and being” (p.  18). Heeding Manning’s caution  and in 
response to her call, we turn below to two Indigenous creation stories, which are 
embedded within the respective philosophies4 from which they have been shared.
3.4  Stories of Relationality
Stories organize cultures, economies, ideologies, theories of change, and fields of 
study (King, 2003; Liboiron, 2021; Strathern, 1992). According to this understand­
ing of stories, scientific theories are themselves a form of story and scientific prac­
tice a form of storying (Phillips & Bunda, 2018, p. 5). We present these stories in 
order that we may learn from and with them and those philosophies of which they 
are a part. In so doing, we hope to illuminate possibilities that lie within these rich 
conceptions of relationality and reciprocity.5
4 Here Indigenous philosophies are taken to mean: ways of being, knowing, and responding that are 
embedded in story, song, poem, and prayer, and grounded in patterns, processes, and peoples of 
particular Land (Manning, 2017).
5 There are more relational understandings to be found in the ecological psychology literature as 
well (Heft, 2001; Van Dijk, 2021). It is an interesting open question to investigate how the notions 
of relationality relied on in affordance theoretization compared to the notions of relationality in 
Indigenous philosophies.
M. Donald and J. Bruineberg

27
We recognize the importance of humility in engaging with the stories we are cit­
ing here; neither of the two authors of this chapter identifies as Indigenous,6 and 
these are not our stories. These are stories of place, rooted in the Land from which 
they have emerged. As such, we quote from versions that have been published in 
print and widely distributed. We recommend that those interested in extended ver­
sions of these stories seek out the writings and/or storytelling of those who hold 
these stories in their bones.
3.4.1  Food
The story “How Food Was Given” is one of the stories shared most widely through­
out Syilx territory.7 We quote here from a version published in the book “We Are the 
People: A Trilogy of Okanagan Legends” (Okanagan Tribal Council, 2017). This 
story details “the world before this world,” when “everyone was alive and walking 
around like we do” (p. 10).
“All Creation talked about the coming changes to their world. They had been told 
that soon a new kind of people would be living on this earth” (p. 10). In preparation 
for this, the animal and plant people met “to decide how the People-To-Be would 
live and what they would eat” (ibid.). Black Bear, Chief for all creatures on the land, 
Spring Salmon, Chief for all creatures in the water, Bitterroot, Chief for all things 
underground, and Saskatoon Berry, Chief for all things growing on land, are “the 
four Chiefs for all Creation” (p.  13). The Chiefs thought and thought, over the 
course of many meetings, about what they could give the People-To-Be to eat that 
was already here on earth. Bitterroot, Salmon, and Saskatoon Berry placed their 
trust in Bear, as the oldest and wisest among them to make a decision: “I will have 
to do the best I can,” said Bear, “I will give myself, and all the animals I am Chief 
over, to be food for the People-To-Be” (p. 17). Following suit, the others agreed, 
they too would give themselves and their kin to help nourish the People-To-Be.
“Chief Bear was happy because there would be enough food for the People-­
To-­Be. Bear said, “Now, I will lay down my life to make these things happen”’ 
(p. 25). Healing in that world was a practice of song: “They all took turns singing, 
but Bear did not come back to life” (p. 26). Finally, Fly came to sing a powerful 
song, which brought Bear back to life. “Then Fly told the four Chiefs, “From now 
on when the People-To-Be are here and they take your body for food, they will sing 
this song. They will cry their thanks with this song”’ (p. 27). Bear then spoke for all 
6 Donald works with Syilx collaborators, the people of the Land with which she lives and conducts 
her research. Her ethics and research praxis have been heavily influenced by scholars of Indigenous 
methodologies, both Syilx and of other Lands, and as a result, she works within an anti-colonial 
conceptual framework that stems from Syilx priorities for Land and research.
7 Syilx Land is currently occupied by the province of British Columbia in Canada and the state of 
Washington in the USA, approximately 400 km inland from the Pacific Ocean.

the Chiefs, “everything will have its own song. The People-To-Be will use these 
songs to help each other as you have helped me”’ (ibid.).
The story finishes:
That is how food was given to our people.
That is how songs were given to our people.
That is how giving and helping one another was and still is taught to our people.
This is why we must respect even the smallest, weakest person for what they can contribute.
That is why we give thanks and honor to what is given to us. (p. 30)
“How Food Was Given” tells of how humans, the People-To-Be, came to be able to 
live and eat here on earth: through generosity and sacrifice. Every human act of 
nourishment is a result of another lifeform having given over the life or life-giving 
capacity of themselves or their offspring. Think, for instance, of bread, made from 
the seeds of grasses who produced those seeds for the purposes of their own repro­
duction; milk, food produced for one’s own offspring and taken by another; or 
leaves, where plants hold the capacity to nourish themselves.
“That is why we give thanks,” the story tells us. The simple and profound prac­
tice of giving thanks opens up the possibility to think otherwise about affordances 
as offerings of the environment. Let us start by reconsidering Gibson’s statement 
that affordances are what the environment offers the animal. In “How Food Was 
Given,” offering is not a mere possibility but an active gift: the animal and plant 
people decide to give their life to nourish humans. When Chief Black Bear says: 
“eat me”, this is not an expression of “what it is,” but an expression of what it offers 
itself as food for the People-To-Be to survive.
Importantly, receiving a gift is different from buying something. A purchase 
involves the exchange of something of ostensibly equal value. Receiving a gift, on 
the other hand, requires a different kind of reciprocity. Gifts are unproblematically 
asymmetric by nature. In the Syilx story, the gift of food is something that the 
People-To-Be reciprocate by “giving thanks and honor to what is given.” This is not 
an “equal” offering but recognition and reciprocal statement of gratitude.
3.4.2  Water and Fire
Second only to air, water is that which has the most influence in and over our lives. 
This may not seem to be the case if the tap in your domicile has always afforded 
on-demand potable water; take that affordance away however, and this truth will be 
all too clear.
On the continent of Australia, Indigenous stories of the Rainbow Serpent tell of 
water above and below visible land (Rose, 2005). Oodgeroo Noonuccal and her son 
M. Donald and J. Bruineberg

29
Kabul Oodgeroo Noonuccal (Noonuccal & Noonuccal, 1988; of the Noonuccal 
people of Minjerribah) call the Rainbow Serpent, “the giver and taker of life” 
(p. 373). Citing the same constellation of creation stories, Alexis Wright (of the 
Waanyi nation of the southern highlands of the Gulf of Carpentaria) begins her 
novel “Carpentaria” with a description of how the rivers and groundwater channels 
were made:
Picture the creative serpent, scoring deep into  – scouring down through  – the slippery 
underground of the mudflats, leaving in its wake the thunder of tunnels collapsing to form 
deep sunken valleys. The sea water following in the serpent’s wake, swarming in a frenzy 
of tidal waves, soon changed colour from ocean blue to the yellow of mud. The water filled 
the swirling tracks to form the mighty bending rivers spread across the vast plains of the 
Gulf country. The serpent travelled over the marine plains, over the salt flats, through the 
salt dunes, past the mangrove forests and crawled inland. Then it went back to the sea. And 
it came out at another spot along the coastline and crawled inland and back again. (2006, p. 1)
As told by Noonuccal and Noonuccal (1988), “We say the earth is our mother—we 
cannot own her, she owns us. This rock and all these rocks are alive with her spirit. 
They protect us, all of us” (p. 373). Water and rock shape one another.
Noonuccal and Noonuccal (1988) ask and answer the question that guides this 
chapter: “How does one repay such gifts? By protecting the land” (p.  373). 
Protection, however, can be interpreted in innumerable directions with often con­
flicting mandates (Carroll, 2014; Grego, 2015). The European Environment Agency, 
for example, defines “nature protection” as
Precautionary actions, procedures or installations undertaken to prevent or reduce harm to 
the elements of the material world that exist independently of human activity. (GEMET, n.d.; 
emphasis added)
In the European context, nature is what happens when humans are not involved. 
Protection then takes the shape of not interfering with, of letting things be. In 
Indigenous Australian contexts, protection takes a very different form. Gammage 
(2011) details the active management of Land predominantly through the burning of 
vegetation. The burning of vegetation not only prevented the outbreak of uncontrol­
lable fires but also shepherded grazing animals and regenerated vegetation: “a 
planned, precise, fine-grained local caring” (p. 25).
These careful and caring fire management practices are intertwined with cere­
mony. Mick Bourke (Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Wurrung) writes,
When we go to a cultural burn, we do a welcome at the start with a small fire and smoke. 
This is to let the old folks, our ancestors, know we are on Country so then they can guide 
us. People need to understand that cultural fire is not just about burning Country, lighting it 
to reduce fuels, reduce risk to houses, or things like that. We use fire to put colour back into 
the landscape, as well make our ceremony, connect with each other, connect with our his­
tory, and that’s just the start. (Bourke et al., 2020, p. 547)
We know that if you care for Country then the Country will care for you. (p. 546)
This shows how practices of protection and care are reciprocal. These practices of 
care are embedded in and perpetuated by ceremony and the origin stories that are 
passed down through generations. In “the Rainbow Serpent,” the gifts are

reciprocated by protection and taking care. Protection of Land8 is not understood as 
leaving Land untouched, but as active land management through, for example, prac­
ticing controlled burning. Attending to practices of care can make us question the 
widely held assumption that the affordances of the environment are there indepen­
dent of human activity. Only when Land is cared for and protected will the country 
continue to offer its affordances.
3.5  Conclusion
Elements of a logic of extraction can easily be read into canonical formulations of 
affordances: they are offerings of the environment that call us out to use them. In 
this chapter, we have thought with gift logic and two creation stories to explore a 
different conceptual footing for a theory of affordances.
Following a logic of the gift, the primary affordance relation is not one in which 
“World says: exploit me,” but in which “World says: care for me, so that I can care 
for you”: only by caring for Land will Land continue to offer its affordances. 
Alongside the fruit that says “eat me,” the fruit tree says “water me” and “thank 
me.” In the literature on ecological psychology, there has been an overemphasis on 
the “eat me” kind of solicitations and too little attention to the “water me” and 
“thank me” kind.

A Path to Ecological Psychology
Anthony Chemero
4.1  A Path to Ecological Psychology
When I started working toward my Ph.D. in philosophy and cognitive science, I was 
already skeptical about mental representation. This skepticism was inherited from 
my undergraduate mentor Daniel Dennett and, even more so, from reading the word 
of his mentor Gilbert Ryle. For this reason, work in robotics by Randy Beer (2000) 
and Brooks (1999) was music to my young ears. These two roboticists claimed, and 
had functioning robots to show, that computational manipulations of representa­
tions of the environment actually hinder the development of effective mobile robots. 
Brooks explicitly claimed that his robots had nothing to do with “German philoso­
phy”, but a paper by Beth Preston (1993) convinced me otherwise and led me to 
Martin Heidegger, which led me eventually to Maurice Merleau-Ponty. All this 
occurred while I was still enmeshed in working on philosophical issues in cognitive 
science. At a certain point, I wondered how Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty would 
try to do cognitive science. This is what led me to read James Gibson. What led me 
to become very serious about ecological psychology was a job. I was hired at 
Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania as a replacement for the great, tragi­
cally short-lived ecological psychologist Edward Reed, and I had promised during 
my interview that I could teach his course called “Ecological Psychology.” I spent 
the six months between being offered the job and starting it reading Reed and 
Gibson, trying to make myself into someone who could teach that course. In doing 
so, I fell in intellectual love.
I was in love, yes, but still a philosopher. As Jerry Fodor put it, “many philoso­
phers secretly harbor the view that there is something deeply wrong with psychol­
ogy, but that a philosopher with a little training in the techniques of linguistic

analysis and a free afternoon could straighten it out” (1968, vii).1 My aim was to try 
to do for ecological psychology what Fodor attempted for cognitive psychology. 
Neither of us succeeded, but I recount my efforts here, after presenting a little his­
tory. James Gibson died in 1979, soon after publishing the Ecological Approach to 
Visual Perception (1979/2014; EAVP). When it came under immediate attack, 
including by Fodor (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1981), it was left to others to defend 
Gibson’s ideas. Michael Turvey, Robert Shaw, William Mace, and Edward Reed 
(1981) produced a detailed reply to Fodor and Pylyshyn, in which they set out 
detailed formal and conceptual structures to make Gibson’s sometimes impression­
istic text into the foundation for a rigorous science. This paper is an undeniable 
masterwork and has led to decades of excellent science. But from my point of view, 
it was problematic in that it interpreted Gibson’s text so that it was less compatible 
with the ideas of Merleau-Ponty. I understood Gibson’s project as being aligned 
with Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological philosophy, an understanding that is par­
tially confirmed by the fact that the archives at Cornell contain Gibson’s detailed 
notes on The Phenomenology of Perception, which he read while writing EAVP 
(Mace 2014).
In any event, I spent a series of free afternoons trying to develop an alternative 
reading of Gibson’s ideas. The two key differences between my elaboration and that 
of Turvey and colleagues concerned the ontology of two key concepts from Gibson’s 
text: information and affordances. I will focus on the latter and will just say a few 
things about the former. For Gibson, perception is the use of information in the 
environment to guide behavior without intervening representations. Gibson fre­
quently, but not always, discussed information in terms of specification. Think of 
the way a contract specifies outcomes in that it guarantees that those outcomes will 
come to pass. Gibson thought this was the relationship between information in, say, 
light and objects in the environment. Having reflected off an apple, the light that hits 
my eyes over time specifies the presence of an apple. Turvey and colleagues spelled 
this out in terms of a 1:1 relationship between the structure in light and objects in 
the world. If the structure in the light was 1:1 related to the presence of an apple, 
then the light could carry information about an apple. Rob Withagen and I argued 
that this relationship is too strict and that structures that are merely correlated with 
entities in the environment can also carry information about those entities (Withagen 
& Chemero, 2009, 2012). Our intent was to make it such that there was more infor­
mation available to perceivers to guide their action, including so-called 
representation-­hungry actions (Bruineberg et  al., 2019). Because this is a book 
about affordances, I will leave the discussion of information at that.
Gibson is most known for his concept of affordances, which he defines multiple 
times in his 1979 book, and not always in the same way. The most basic formulation 
is that affordances are opportunities in the environment available to any creature 
that can perceive and act on them. Turvey and colleagues defined affordances as 
dispositional properties of entities in the environment, which were complemented

by dispositional properties of actors; the environmental dispositions are affordance, 
while those of actors are what they called effectivities. This struck me as at odds 
with Gibson’s most widely discussed description of affordances.
[A]n affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you 
like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to under­
stand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of behavior. It is both 
physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance points both ways, to the environment and 
to the observer (1979, 129).
Turvey and colleagues define affordances as objective, physical properties of the 
environment, which does not respect Gibson’s claims that they are both subjective 
and objective, psychical and physical, or neither. But it does do several other useful 
things. Here are two. First, it is utterly unmysterious in the way that Gibson’s for­
mulation is not and, because of this, seems more appropriate for the foundations of 
scientific psychology. Second, in what Reed (1996) calls the “fundamental thesis of 
ecological psychology,” having affordances be properties of the environment allows 
them to be the driver of evolution by natural selection. Affordances exist in the 
world; animal species evolve to be able to take advantage of them.
In contrast, I argued that affordances are relations between an animal’s abilities 
to act and a situation in the world (2003, 2009). Affordances, on this view, are nei­
ther properties of the environment, nor properties of the actor; instead, they are the 
way actors fit into environments. This has neither of the benefits mentioned above 
that the view of Turvey and colleagues does. It is somewhat mysterious, and it takes 
affordances out of the evolutionary processes. It has other advantages, though, the 
most important of which is that it is more faithful to Gibson’s intentions. Like 
Merleau-Ponty, Gibson was strongly influenced by Gestalt psychology. Gibson was 
a colleague of Koffka as a young professor at Smith College, and Koffka’s influence 
is clearly visible in Gibson’s early work (e.g., Gibson and Crook 1938). Written 
around the same time, Merleau-Ponty’s first book The Structure of Behavior (1942) 
is primarily a meditation on the philosophical consequences of Gestalt psychology 
in which he says that “The world, inasmuch as it harbors living beings, ceases to be 
a material plenum consisting of juxtaposed parts; it opens up as the place where 
behavior appears” (1942, 47). We could translate this into Gibson’s terminology: a 
world with actors in it is a world of affordances. But this translation does not work 
if we take affordances to be dispositional properties of the environment. Moreover, 
and this is explained in great detail in Harry Heft’s monumental Ecological 
Psychology in Context (2001), Gibson considered himself to be a Jamesian radical 
empiricist. During this late-career era of theorizing, James argued for two key 
points: that relations are key parts of our experience and that there was not any 
ontological distinction between the physical and psychical.
Although I would argue that the relational understanding of affordances makes 
better sense of Gibson’s intentions, most practicing ecological psychologists think I 
am wrong, and even that I am ruining ecological psychology as a science. The pri­
mary reason for this is that nearly every practicing ecological psychologist had their 
Ph.D. directed by Turvey or Shaw or someone whose Ph.D. had been directed by 
4  A Path to Ecological Psychology

36
Turvey or Shaw. (They have been extraordinarily influential.) At the same time, 
however, the differences between my view of affordances (and information) and 
theirs are not empirically consequential. That is, you would do the very same exper­
iments and expect the very same results whether affordances are relations or dispo­
sitional properties of the environment.2 In fact, these views are quite similar, and 
their small differences pale in comparison to the differences between them and the 
cognitivist theories of affordances that take them to be some kind of mental projec­
tion onto the world (e.g., Norman, 1988). Turvey and I agree on this (Chemero & 
Turvey, 2007). So this difference seems to be merely philosophical, the kind of thing 
to argue about at the pub or in philosophy papers but best kept out of the lab.
This is where the debate has been for a while now: some people think affor­
dances are relations; some people think they are dispositions; differences of opinion 
on this are not barriers to collaboration. More recently, though, Ed Baggs has con­
vinced me to see things slightly differently (Baggs & Chemero, 2019, 2021). The 
relational and dispositional views are both valuable, and for different purposes. In 
order to introduce his notions of information and affordances, Gibson distinguishes 
between the physical world and the ecological world. The physical world is just 
what it sounds like, and the ecological world is mesoscopic sub-parts of the physical 
world that are relevant to perception and action. When Gibson talks about the affor­
dances that exist in the ecological world, he routinely shifts between the affordances 
for an idealized type of some kind of animal (the affordances for dogs) and the 
affordances for individuals (the affordances for me). These are not the same thing: 
apples afford eating for any human with the right kind of abilities; this particular 
apple is mine and affords eating only for me. Baggs and I proposed to signal this 
distinction by pointing out that Gibson distinguished between two things when he 
should have had three. Instead of just the physical vs. the ecological works, he 
should have distinguished between the physical world, the habitat for a particular 
species, and the umwelt of an individual actor.3 The apple affords eating in the habi­
tat that you and Satoshi share, but only in his umwelt.
This distinction of kinds of affordances allows us to see the value of both affor­
dances as relations and affordances as dispositions. If you are trying to make sense 
of the world as experienced by an individual actor, like when you are doing phe­
nomenology, you are interested in the affordances in their umwelt. If you are trying 
to design a psychology experiment that a whole range of people can participate in, 
you are interested in the affordances of the human habitat.4 Gibson did both, and 
both are important projects. He just should have used more terms to do them.
That was history. Here is how I see research on affordances going forward. In 
most papers about affordances, including this one, the example affordances are

are not using the term “umwelt” in its original von Uexküllian sense. He is probably right about that.

in terms of the statistically average member of the population, which is not the same as the “nor­
mal” member of the population.

those we have names for, even if sometimes the names are tortured constructions. 
We talk about affordances like edible, climbable, sit-on-able, and the like. This is 
partly just laziness, but it is also misleading in that it paints too static a picture of the 
world that we live and act in. Consider two examples of what we might call dynamic 
affordances.
	1.	 Imagine Satoshi walking home on a rainy afternoon. The wet sidewalk affords 
walking, of course, but not in the same way as it would when it is dry. When he 
arrives home, he walks up the wet concrete path to wet wooden stairs, which 
have another different affordance for walking, and then to the dry wooden porch, 
covered by a roof. Inside, he takes his shoes off and perceives yet another type of 
affordance, this one for walking in socks on carpet, and another when he steps 
onto the wood floor. Each of these situations requires Satoshi to respond to sub­
tly but importantly different affordances, and he does so automatically and 
seamlessly.
	2.	 Imagine that Satoshi wants to take two different kinds of vitamin. The bottle is 
graspable, yes, but graspable with a particular hand and wrist orientation. He 
twists the top off with his other hand and shakes the tablets into his hand. The 
pills in Satoshi’s hand are also graspable, but not in the same way that the jar 
was: to put the lid back on the jar, he presses them against his palm with two 
fingers and uses his thumb and two other fingers to twist the lid back on. The 
second jar affords grasping the same way the first one did, but this time he needs 
to open it just with thumb and two fingers. Luckily, the jar has that affordance 
and also affords shaking pills out onto the part of his palm left over, given that he 
is still holding the tablets from the first jar.
The point of these examples is that most of the affordances we perceive and act 
upon are not like edibility or climbability; they are dynamic. In real-time engage­
ment with an umwelt, what is afforded is constantly changing; so, too, are our action 
capabilities. We navigate this seamlessly. This is where the concept of affordances 
gets its best grip, in the ways we subtly and successfully change our patterns of 
action to fit the demands of a changing environment.

A Walk in the Park: Affordance as Urban 
Design Tool for Creating Inhabitable Cities
Ditte Bendix Lanng and Ole B. Jensen
5.1  Introduction
Affordances are the kind of interactions you can engage in conjunction with a given site or 
element. For pavement, you can walk on it; you can sit on it; you can drive on it [...] you 
have to actualize it as this or that. What will it be? It is your choice at any given time. So, in 
the actualization of things, people may play essential roles. But one should not underesti­
mate the materials: their hardness, their softness, their ability to maintain a shape. All this 
makes the material a player in a way that is significant, causative not causal. (Rob Shields 
in Fariás, 2010, p. 297)
In this chapter, we explore the proposition that affordance is an important urban 
design tool that can help create inhabitable cities for people. The creation of inhabit­
able cities for people is a core ambition in urban design, resonating the aim of the 
discipline to formulate responses to situated urban problems by means of spatial 
strategies and architectural design. From the 1950s, urban design grew as a disci­
pline from an apprehension of the importance of the public realm of cities, the 
human scale, and the thriving of the collective urban population (Mumford, 2009). 
Following this core ambition of the urban design profession, urban designers have 
sought to develop methods and tools for the creation of such cities. These tools must 
provide alternatives to a city-making method based on the form or function of 
objectified buildings and spaces, or on structural patterns, and instead foreground 
the city as an environment for inhabitation. As when Gehl speak of invitations 
(1971) and Lynch and Hack of fit between environment and behavior (Lynch & 
Hack, 1984).
In this essay, we follow this proposition and explore the thesis that the concept of 
affordance can help us do that, in encircling how space, for example, pushes us

through, invites us to linger, or embraces us in tiny rooms (Lanng, 2015). Architecture 
critic Aron Betsky has articulated that an “architecture of affordances” may hold a 
promise for the creation of “environments that afford us possibilities, that open and 
enclose, that respond and give us clues” (Betsky, 2015). As such, affordance may be 
a tool to approach the design of cities in terms of the “perceived and exploited uses 
to which we [the urban inhabitants] can put the environments architects create” 
(ibid.).
In the opening quote above, cultural sociologist Rob Shields offers initiating 
pointers for the usefulness of affordance to the design of the urban environment. He 
highlights that affordance targets the interaction between a human and the material 
environment and underlines that this interaction is two-sided, or, we might say, rela­
tional. Whereas, on the one hand, subjectivity plays indispensable roles in actual­
izing the affordances of the environment, on the other hand, also the character and 
features of the material environment are key to the interaction. The material matters 
to the ways in which humans can inhabit their environment. The focus on this rela­
tional interaction between the designed environment and humans hones in on a 
design concern for the human being-in space.
5.2  The Concept of Affordance in Urban Design
Environmental psychologist James Gibson writes about environmental affordances, 
defining them in the following way: “The affordances of the environment are what 
it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill” (Gibson, 
1986, p. 119). Through Gibson’s definition, we see that the concept of affordance 
addresses the interaction between the animal and its environment. As such, it targets 
a key concern for urban design: how designed environments relate to humans, more 
specifically what actions and experiences they make possible.
A study on Bodies and everyday practices in designed urban environments by 
cultural sociologists Monica Degen, Gillian Rose, and Begum Basdas (2010) dem­
onstrates the potential use of the concept of affordance. The researchers have inves­
tigated British urban environments to research how bodies inhabit these 
environments—how various human practices “are made possible” (p. 60) by the 
interaction of human bodies and the material surroundings. They bring out ordinary 
moments that happen in urban spaces, such as waiting at a bench or looking at shoes 
in a shop window. The role of the designed environment in those interactions is 
described as constantly interacting, supporting, and colliding with human bodies, 
whereas the role of human bodies in those interactions is to respond, go along with, 
or ignore the environmental affordances.
This speaks to the relationality of affordances. To appreciate relationality, we can 
turn to psychologist Harry Heft (2010) who argues that perceiving what the physical 
environment affords is not a uniform process in the minds of people. Rather it hap­
pens “where the action is,” in the “specific dynamic coupling of a human body and 
the physical environment” (p. 29). Different humans do not engage with an urban

space in the same ways, and each person may engage in one way with the space in 
one situation and in another way in a second situation. This suggests that humans 
read different affordances into the same part of the city fabric, or, in other words, 
that humans actualize affordances in distinct and specific ways at any given time.
Still, the material design of urban space matters, as stated by Shields. Architect 
Jan Gehl’s work with universal invitations provides an operational way to under­
stand this. Offered as part of his work on a human-oriented approach to design 
(1971), Gehl takes outset in the imperative of urban design to invite humans to 
inhabit spaces. The designed invitations must target “universal” human needs, so 
that humans find it attractive to be there. According to Gehl, this includes that the 
urban environment provides opportunities to walk, act, and rest, that it provides 
protection, e.g., against traffic, and against unpleasant impacts on senses, and that it 
provides experiences, e.g., of positive climatic impacts, of scale and aesthet­
ics (2016).
Through these sources, we have briefly unfolded ways to approach the city as an 
environment for inhabitation. Affordance, here, is a conceptual tool to tease out 
opportunities and qualities for inhabitation in the designed urban environment. In 
the next section, we engage in a study of affordances of a particular urban landscape 
to further explore the proposition that affordance can function as an operational tool 
to approach the design of inhabitable cities. We draw out how affordance attunes the 
urban designer to the human being-in space, and the many actions and experiences 
that may be afforded in the concrete realities of humans inhabiting urban space.
5.3  An Urban Landscape of Affordances
Consider the urban slope on the photograph (Fig. 5.1). It is part of the castle park in 
the center of the Danish city of Aalborg. The Castle was built during the period 
1539–1555. As it was found unfit for fortification, it was used as the seat of power 
for the King’s provincial governors. Today the buildings house government offices, 
and the park is publicly accessible. It is one of few green spaces in the city center, 
used for informal stay and for transit.
5.3.1  Being-In Space
A significant feature of the park is the rampart. As a historical reminiscence, the 
rampart raises around the castle building wings to the west, south, and east. It is a 
noteworthy experience to move through the park on the side of the sloped rampart 
and to climb the slopes. These grassed hills roll down to a planar area with tall urban 
buildings on the other side. Big trees on the planar area and on the slopes reinforce 
the remarkable landscaped setting. With foliage, they make a dark green roof as a

counterpart to the soft grass underfoot, and they emphasize the feeling of moving 
through a gorge-like space, and of climbing its side to reach a vantage point.
The remarkable topography of the slopes is one of the defining spatial character­
istics of the park. The sheer difference in height between below and above is signifi­
cant for the inner city of Aalborg. This dramatic topography combined with the 
relatively small size of the enclosed park and the large trees gives the space a dra­
maturgical feeling.

5.3.2  Which Actions and Experiences Does the Urban 
Slope Afford?
Based on observations done on several occasions in the castle park, at different 
times of day and season, we draw forward five ordinary instances of human embod­
ied engagements that the slope appears to afford (Fig. 5.2).
By considering each of the diagrammatic sections depicting the slope from top 
to bottom, we can appreciate some of its various affordances:
The slope affords a rest at the foot of it;

•	 It affords a playful, unrestrained run downwards
•	 It affords cloud watching on the soft grass
•	 It affords a struggling bodily effort to get to the top – perhaps pulling the sled up 
on slippery snow;
•	 It affords a privileged position from which to see and be seen
With these affordances, the urban slope is an intriguing example. Daily life 
human actions and experiences are made possible here—actions and experiences 
with basic qualities of inhabiting the city. The form of the slope is simple—a dis­
tinct modeling of an urban floor. It is a human-made sculpted folding in the crust of 
the earth that—by that very folding—affords numerous actions and experiences. 
The folding multiplies the possibilities for intimate bodily interactions with the 
urban floor.
The exemplified affordances of the urban slope are specific to the slope of this 
park. A wealth of specificities—material features, details, and contextual character­
istics—are relevant to understand what the urban slope affords. We can make this 
point vivid by asking how affordances would be different if various features of the 
slope were changed: What if, for example, the slope was not covered with grass, 
affording a certain kind of tactile relationship with the body, but instead had a con­
crete surface? What if it was clad in wood? What if it was not a smooth inclination 
as this one, but was modified to have steps carved into it, or raised platforms added 
to it? What if the inclination was altered, so that the slope would be steeper? What 
if, instead of the location of the slope in this shielded, enclosed urban space in the 
inner city, it was located on a windy site by the fiord only a stone’s throw to the north?
These, and other alterations of the design features of the slope, would change the 
affordances of it. This speaks to the importance of both form-making and of contex­
tual sensitivity. And it speaks to how affordance lets us regard the small scale of the 
design of the city. Very specifically and with detail, it sharpens the urban designer’s 
apprehension of humans being-in space. This apprehension can shape an alternative 
to a visual or structural city making method, in cultivating attention to possible rela­
tions between humans and their environment, shaped around the “many nitty-gritty, 
material-performative details that are so important to both architects’ design and 
users’ experiences” and through that “evade perhaps all (visual) symbolism” (Kraftl 
& Adey, 2008, p. 214). In other words, this apprehension of humans being-in space 
zooms in on how urban design may work to “kindle certain capacities for inhabita­
tion” (ibid., p. 225), in producing affordances for human action and experience.
5.4  Atmosphere
According to Heft (2010), affordance connects not only to potential human activity, 
but it also connects to the affective quality or emotional intensity of a possibility in 
the physical environment (see also Jensen et al., 2017). Through the example above, 
we might be able to imagine ourselves in the position of the human on the slope who 
D. B. Lanng and O. B. Jensen

47
has decided to lay down and enjoy a moment of cloud watching on the soft grass. 
This is not just an instrumental action-oriented situation. Rather it is a situation 
charged with an affective pull (Heft, 2010), in which multiple senses and emotions 
may be activated: the tactile feeling of the soft grass, its smell; the sun warming the 
body, the occasional clouds changing the visual scene above you.
We may attempt to understand this through the notion of atmosphere. Despite its 
ephemeral status, there seems to be an acknowledgment of the condition that 
humans are deeply intertwined with the atmospheres of urban spaces. Philosopher 
Gernot Böhme argued that atmosphere “does not relate to the determinations of 
things, but to the way in which they radiate outwards into space, to their output as 
generators of atmospheres” (Böhme, 2013, p. 14). Such a notion of radiation sug­
gests that the atmospheres of an urban space is coming into being in the interactions 
between humans and the many other components of the space. Here these include 
the full situation, made up by the form, orientation, material of the slope, the 
weather, time of day, the contextual location of the slope and the park, and much 
more. This underlines that the affordances of an urban space have to do with much 
more than the actions it affords; that it is deeply connected to the experiences 
(including sensorial impressions and emotions) that it affords. The relationship 
between affordance and atmosphere has to do with the embodied sensations of 
given materialities, as well as with the cultural readings of the situation. Atmospheres 
entangle affordances through a complex relationship between physical actions, mul­
tisensorial sensations, and cultural conventions.
5.5  Beyond Manual
The relationality of affordances makes it clear that designers cannot prescribe (all) 
actions and experiences. Humans tend to approximate urban spaces, use them, and 
experience them, on their own terms. So, rather than applying affordance as a tool 
to strive for an exact prescription of activities and experiences, we may consider 
how designed urban spaces offer certain suggestions for inhabiting the city. The 
slope has certain propensities (or, suggestions) to invite certain actions and experi­
ences, but it does not determine these (it is, in the words of Shield from the opening 
quote, causative, not causal). Above we foregrounded that affordances of urban 
environments are relational and situational, not universal. The material design inter­
acts with, makes possible, or hinders certain types of inhabitations. Humans, on the 
other hand, go along with, ignore, or transgress the intended possibilities. In effect 
the designed environment may afford many different inhabitations beyond the 
intentions of the designer, as we saw it through the slope of the castle park.
The realization that designed urban environments work beyond the intentions of 
the designer should not, however, be considered a threat (Lanng & Borg, 2021). 
Architectural scholar David Leatherbarrow urges designers, instead, to cherish how 
architecture always exists in its “concrete reality […] regardless of my interests or 
yours” (Leatherbarrow, 2009, p.  46). He emphasizes that it is by means of 
5  A Walk in the Park: Affordance as Urban Design Tool for Creating Inhabitable Cities

48
architecture’s participation in the shared conditions of those concrete realities that 
prolific patterns of life occur (see also Till, 2009). This may be particularly relevant 
when considering urban space: open, publicly accessible, and forming part of the 
shared connective tissue of the city.
From some urban theories we learn that openness and even disorder have impor­
tant value for the inhabitation of cities (Sandra & Sennett, 2020). City life cannot be 
put on manual. Contrary to what a determinist planning philosophy suggests, spaces 
of openness and unruliness may become spaces for human flourishing (this may be 
considered through the notion of loose spaces, see Franck & Stevens, 2007). 
Philosopher Michael Waltzer directs our attention to the need for “open-minded” 
spaces in the light of an increasing amount of “single-minded” space design 
(Waltzer, 1986). While the latter may be important for particular urban functions 
such as commerce, the city must offer spaces free from dictate and instruction: 
open-minded spaces that can lead to unplanned vitality and diverse interaction. 
Sociologist Richard Sennett argued that when conflict is permitted in the public 
sphere, the result will be “greater sensitivity in public life” (Sennett, 1996, p. 198).
For the usage of affordance as an urban design tool, this suggests an acknowledg­
ment of openness and the absence of designed instructions. The design of public 
urban space must find the delicate balance of offering possibilities but maintain an 
openness for human actualization and approximation. Honing in on the affordances 
of an urban space can allow the urban designer a trajectory to work through the 
concrete realities of the ways in which humans inhabit space, and how urban space 
design aid in providing such balanced opportunities for inhabitation.
5.6  Conclusion
With this essay, we have examined the proposition that affordance can serve as an 
operational tool in a human-oriented urban design methodology. By applying the 
concept of affordance as a tool for elaborating the relational quality of the urban 
park above, we have engaged in an attunement to the inhabitation of that urban 
landscape. The concept of affordance foregrounds a detailed awareness of the pos­
sibilities for actions and experiences that are made possible by this particular urban 
landscape. In this sense, affordance performs as an operational tool for urban design 
analysis and development. It equips the urban designer with a qualified and reflec­
tive inception for a design approach that centers on precise considerations of human 
being-in space, herein with the small scale of forming material propensities to invite 
activities and multisensorial engagements in urban space.

Anthropological Affordances
Tim Ingold
6.1  The Ecological Approach in Anthropology 
and Psychology
I come from a background in ecological anthropology, a specialism dedicated to 
understanding how human beings adapt to their environments through the media­
tion of ways of doing things that are not just innate but, to an extent probably 
unmatched in the animal kingdom, culturally learned. Our efforts, however, had run 
into an impasse. For we could not decide where to place culture in the human–envi­
ronment relation. Is the environment a natural given: a set of objective conditions to 
which its human inhabitants devise adaptive solutions, drawing on the resources of 
culture to do so? Or does the world become an environment for humans only insofar 
as it is already invested by culture with meanings and values, which then condition 
the practices in which they engage? Or to put it another way, does nature set the 
terms of adaptation, to which human populations respond by means of culture, or is 
it culture that actually sets the terms? This, of course, is an old debate, pitting physi­
cal determinism against cultural constructionism.1 But as I was searching for a way 
to resolve it, a possible answer came from an unexpected quarter, namely the 
ecological approach to perception and action pioneered in the field of psychology 
by James Gibson.
1 Perhaps the most famous articulation of the anthropological debate was by Marshall Sahlins, in 
his Culture and Practical Reason (Sahlins, 1976). Sahlins took the side of culture.

This was in the early 1980s. At that time, Gibson’s work was virtually unknown 
in anthropology. I have found only one previous reference to it in anthropological 
literature, in an essay on “Cultural factors in spatial orientation,” penned in the 
1950s by A. Irving Hallowell (1955: 184–202). One of the most prescient and origi­
nal anthropologists of his day, Hallowell already sensed that Gibson’s ideas could 
help us ground cultural variation in immediate perceptual experience. But he was so 
far ahead of his time that his proposals fell on deaf ears and were not followed up. 
Knowing nothing of this, I was introduced to ecological psychology from quite 
another quarter. I had recently published an article (Ingold, 1983) addressing the 
problem of where to locate culture in the human–environment equation and had 
concluded that while human beings can draw on adaptive resources of both natural 
and cultural provenance, in varying proportions, the purpose that drives their activ­
ity, and gives meaning and value to what they do, is inherently social. It is therefore 
essential, I insisted, to distinguish between the domain of social relations, as the 
crucible of agency, from the domain of nature-culture, which furnishes the instru­
ments that allow this agency to be carried through into practice.
By good fortune, Ed Reed, one of Gibson’s most brilliant but tragically short-­
lived disciples, came across my article and took the trouble to write to me.2 In his 
letter, he pointed out that what I had said about the instrumental role of natural and 
cultural resources could be better expressed with the Gibsonian concept of affor­
dance. For the human being at large in an environment, I would only have to say that 
the things encountered there, whether naturally present or culturally formed, afford 
openings along which social life can proceed, or alternatively, hindrances that block 
the way. Intrigued by this suggestion, I delved into the literature of ecological psy­
chology and began attending the international conferences on “event perception and 
action,” which brought its practitioners together. All were united in their opposition 
to the premise, fundamental to mainstream cognitive psychology, that perception is 
the operation of a mind, encased in a body, in processing the data of raw sensation 
into final images or “percepts.” They would insist, to the contrary, that perception is 
the achievement of a whole living organism, indissolubly mind and body, actively 
engaged in its surroundings. As such, perception yields to no finalities, but carries 
on, even as life does. Or as Gibson (1979: 253) put it, “perception … does not have 
an end. Perceiving goes on.”
Nevertheless, despite their common allegiance to a Gibsonian program, I found 
ecological psychologists to be fiercely divided among themselves. The seeds of 
discord had indeed already been sown in Gibson’s seminal text, The Ecological 
Approach to Visual Perception, in which he had simultaneously put forward two, 
apparently irreconcilable positions. One, which we could call “realist,” is that 
objects in the environment afford what they do because of what they are. Affordances, 
that is, are intrinsic properties of objects in themselves, regardless of whether any 
living being is there to realize them. They define a niche in the environment for a 
creature to fill; remove the creature, and the niche is still there. The other position, 
2 Reed’s (1988) study, James J. Gibson and the Psychology of Perception, remains definitive.

which we could call “relational,” is that affordances exist only insofar as they are 
realized in the activity of a creature for which, or for whom, they are of conse­
quence. No creature; no affordance. Wanting it both ways, Gibson insisted that 
affordances are real, objective, and physical, even as they are properties of an envi­
ronment that—in explicit contrast to the physical world—is constituted only in rela­
tion to the being whose environment it is.3 For me, this discord immediately rang a 
bell. Not only did it echo contradictions in my own thinking; it also pointed a way 
toward their resolution.
6.2  What to Do About Culture
For as I now realize, I too had been trying to have it both ways, taking a realist 
stance with regard to matters of nature and culture, or objects and artifacts, but a 
relational stance with regard to the conduct of social life. In effect, I had divided the 
human being into two: the person, constituted as an agentive subject by way of their 
involvement with others in an ever-unfolding field of social relations; and the organ­
ism, adapting to a given environment through a suite of innate and acquired attri­
butes. It was a position that could be upheld only by cutting out the domain of the 
social from the ecological domain of organism–environment interaction, and assign­
ing to each a distinct ontological status. But as the tension between the two ontolo­
gies became unsustainable, it dawned on me that the human being is not dual but 
singular—that being an organism and being a person are one and the same. I would 
have, then, to extend the kind of relational thinking I had applied to human persons 
beyond their association with one another to include everything else that, at one 
time or another, would figure in their lives. What we had been used to calling social 
relations would thus be but a subfield of the wider field of environmental relations.
My first attempt to think this through was published in 1992, in a paper entitled 
“Culture and the perception of the environment” (Ingold, 1992). Pitching my argu­
ment against both the constructionist view that culture provides a template for orga­
nizing the chaos of bodily sensation into meaningful representations and the 
adaptationist view that it endows its possessors with the knowledge and equipment 
they need to function in the material world, I suggested that a relational approach to 
affordances might give us a language in which to express how people continually 
bring forth environments, and environments people, that could escape the endless 
back and forth between nature and culture within which ecological anthropology 
had become trapped. In the language of affordances, people would be differentiated 
not by culture but by their variable attunement, through practiced skills of percep­
tion and action, to the features of a world that are ever brought forth into presence 
3 Spot the difference between this: “No animal could exist without an environment surrounding it. 
Equally … an environment implies an animal (or at least an organism) to be surrounded” (1979: 
8), and this: “The organism depends on the environment for its life, but the environment does not 
depend on the organism for its existence” (1979: 129).

by way of their own activity. If nonhuman beings can enter into meaningful rela­
tions with the world without these relations having to be mediated by the concepts 
and categories of a cultural tradition, then, I argued, this must equally be true of 
humans. Culture, in short, doesn’t get in between people and their environments. 
Nothing is between.
Indeed, somewhat overstating the case, I proposed that the best way to deal with 
the problem of what to do about culture is simply to eliminate it from the ecological 
equation, or to accord it at best a secondary role as a medium not of perception but 
of interpretation. We perceive as we go along; we interpret when, reflexively, we 
look back on what we and others have done, recalling it in memory, narrating it in 
stories, and evaluating it in judgments. Perhaps it is in their interpretative prowess, 
made possible by faculties of language and symbolism, that human beings, com­
pared to other animals, truly come into their own. This, in turn, offered a solution to 
another longstanding anthropological conundrum. It lies in the problem of how we 
can come into a shared perception of the world, with people whose experiences of 
life have heretofore been very different from ours. Classically, understanding the 
people of another culture was regarded as a task of translation: an attempt to estab­
lish a cross-over between distinct conceptual worlds. To see things as other people 
do meant keying into their concepts. Yet how can you do this when, without having 
already understood the concepts, it is impossible to obtain the key? You would be 
caught in a vicious circle.
Returning to this problem, a year after my initial foray into Gibson’s ecological 
approach to perception, the theory of affordances once again pointed toward an 
answer (Ingold, 1993). For if perception is not about organizing sensory data in 
terms of acquired concepts, but rather attends to what the world itself affords in the 
practical conduct of life, then to perceive the world as others do, we don’t have to 
get inside their heads. It is enough to join with them in their activities. All percep­
tion entails movement, and as Gibson (1979: 200) pointed out, since moving observ­
ers can be in the same place at different times, it requires no effort of conceptualization 
for them to share the same world. Perception, in other words, is carried on in public, 
rather than in the privacy of isolated minds. It requires only that we should partici­
pate with others, attend closely and carefully to what they are doing, and attune our 
movements with theirs. By doing so—that is, by practicing the method that anthro­
pologists call “participant observation”—we bring forth an environment of affor­
dances in common. This commonality lies, if you will, on the hither side of concepts: 
it precedes and facilitates, rather than depends upon, representation and interpreta­
tion. It is this, of course, that makes anthropological fieldwork possible.
6.3  Affordance and Interpretation
In hindsight, however, I had perhaps been overhasty in expelling culture from the 
field of human–environment relations. My objection was not, after all, to the idea of 
culture as such, but to its association, in the anthropological canon, with a certain 
T. Ingold

55
way of thinking about difference. It is a way that imagines a world divided between 
people of our own and other cultures, each locked into its particular frame of con­
cepts and categories, or “worldview,” for organizing the data of experience. The 
theory of affordances, by contrast, leads us to see difference as emergent from 
within the nexus of our practical involvement with beings and things in the world 
around us, and in the variable skills of perception and action to which it gives rise. 
Thus if two companions, going along together, perceive things differently, it is not 
because they are bringing different mindsets to bear in organizing the same corpus 
of sensory data, but because they have been differentially attuned, through prior 
experience, to what the environment affords. And if culture is just another word for 
difference, of a kind that is not laid down in advance but develops in the course of 
the human life-cycle, then it is not unreasonable to regard the differences we have 
been used to calling cultural as variations on the theme of skill.4
Yet for all that, the idea that in perception, life enters into a direct and unmedi­
ated relation with the world, even as the world opens up to its living inhabitants, has 
proved hard for many anthropologists to swallow. It is almost an article of faith, in 
anthropology, that things can never be perceived directly, but only by way of other 
things that stand for them. Or in a word, we perceive only signs of things, not things 
themselves. There can be no meaning, in this view, without signification. 
Anthropology always wants to hide presence behind its representative signs, per­
ception behind interpretation. The perspective of affordances, however, puts this 
into reverse. It asserts that we perceive things as they come forward into immediate 
presence and impinge on our activity, and not only by way of the signs they leave in 
their wake. Interpretation comes later. This idea of direct perception, however, has 
been widely misunderstood. It doesn’t mean that the world simply imprints itself on 
the mind like a foot in mud, to leave an indelible impression, or that there is some 
kind of mystical fusion between a being and its world. Rather, in Gibson’s under­
standing, perception takes work: it is the investigative peering, snooping, sniffing, 
rummaging, and fumbling that goes on as perceivers discover, in practice, what 
things afford.
This, ultimately, is what sets the ecological approach to perception apart from an 
alternative that has gained much greater traction in recent anthropology. The source 
of this latter approach lies in the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce. For Peirce, 
perception is all about signs and their interpretation. Everything one might per­
ceive—be it a trace, a likeness, a word5—is a sign of something else, yet what it 
stands for turns out to be a sign for something else again, and so on in an unending 
chain of signification in which the world seems to escape, like the end of the rain­
bow, as fast as the perceiver catches up with it. All life, in this view, is semiosis, a 
4 This argument is developed at length in several of the constituent essays of my book The 
Perception of the Environment (Ingold, 2000).
5 These correspond to the three kinds of signs, respectively indexical, iconic, and symbolic, which 
Peirce identified in his inquiry.

tracking of signs and their meanings.6 At first glance, this Peircean understanding of 
perception has much in common with Gibson’s. There is the same pragmatic focus 
on actor-perceivers, at large in an environment, finding a way through, by sussing 
out the meanings of the things they encounter. But here’s the difference: for Gibson, 
meanings are affordances, not interpretations; and affordances are ways along 
which the world comes into presence, not the residual traces or indications of a 
world that has already vanished into absence or hidden from plain sight. Affordances 
are directly perceived, not represented or interpreted.
But anthropologists, convinced that meaning requires signs, have been more 
concerned with extending sign processes to nonhuman worlds than considering the 
possibility that the perception of affordances, common to nonhuman animals, might 
work just as well for humans. In a recent example of the genre, an anthropological 
study among the Runa people of Ecuador, Eduardo Kohn elaborates a complex 
semiotic theory of environmental perception without once mentioning the idea of 
affordances or referring to the ecological approach (Kohn, 2013). It is in represent­
ing the world, Kohn insists, that animate life distinguishes itself from the residue of 
inanimate matter. Yet he is also convinced that signs connote the absence of that to 
which they refer: “all kinds of signs in some way or other re-present what is not 
present” (Kohn, 2013: 23). But how can a creature possibly remain alive if the real 
world continually escapes from it? All living organisms need to eat and breathe: but 
none can breathe absent air or eat absent food. These metabolic processes are fun­
damental to life. Indeed, if anything distinguishes life from non-life, it is not repre­
sentation and interpretation but the coupling of action and perception. The challenge 
for the living organism is not to represent the world in its absence but to participate 
from within in the world’s very coming into presence.
6.4  A World Without Objects
It is high time, I believe, to forge a vocabulary that will allow us to restore the world 
to presence. We cannot do so, however, without facing up to a deep-seated imbal­
ance in Gibson’s own approach to perception. For a while, on the one hand, he 
brings the perceiver back to life, as a being who is continually moving around, 
actively attending to things, exploring their inexhaustible potentials, and becoming 
ever more skilled in the process; on the other hand, the environment is effectively 
solidified: it is portrayed as an environment of objects, every one of which is fixed 
in a rigid and invariant form, rendered inert, ready and waiting for the perceiver to 
come on the scene and to discover what it affords. That’s why, after having long 
considered myself an advocate of the theory of affordances, I have latterly become

rocal axioms of semiotics” to be that “all life is semiosis,” and that “semiosis presupposes life”

exploring a world of objects that are already there, or that have—so to speak—
“precipitated out” from the formative processes that have given rise to them; it must 
also be about being present and aware in the very moment of formation itself. This 
is to join with a “world without objects,” on the crest of its incipience (Ingold, 
2015: 13–17).
There is a beautiful passage in The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception in 
which Gibson describes the make-up of the environment. It consists, he says, “of the 
earth and the sky with objects on the earth and in the sky, of mountains and clouds, 
fires and sunsets, pebbles and stars” (1979: 66). Do mountains, fires, and pebbles, 
then, rest upon the earth? Do clouds, sunsets, and stars hang in the sky? Gibson 
would have it so. He imagines an environment cluttered with objects, much like the 
room of a house is cluttered with furniture. This cluttering, he contends, renders it 
habitable (1979: 78). Just as removing all the furniture from the room leaves a bare 
floor, so a world without objects could only be a barren plain, absolutely flat, stretch­
ing in all directions to the circle of the horizon. Such, according to Gibson, is the 
ground. As the “reference surface for all other surfaces” (1979: 33), the ground 
provides a solid base upon which is mounted everything that might figure as an 
object of perception, barring those celestial bodies whose abode is in the sky. This 
applies, moreover, not only to the city, with its buildings and streets, but also to the 
countryside with its fields and forests, rocky outcrops and pebble-strewn streams.
Gibson’s default assumption, in a word, is that the terrestrial environment is 
built. It is as if we were presented not with the world itself but with its full-scale 
reconstruction, all laid out in advance. But the real world is not like that. Mountains, 
for example, do not stand erect upon the ground but are formations of the ground 
itself, continually shaped as the earth’s rising, driven by tectonic forces, meets the 
sky’s falling in the erosive effects of wind and weather. In this world, unlike in its 
reconstruction, fires burn and pebbles grate; clouds billow as moisture-laden folds 
of crumpled air and glow in the light of the setting sun; stars shine as pin-pricks of 
light in the night sky. All are phenomena of an environment that is not already 
built—already populated with objects—but ever in formation. Even in the city, 
buildings do not really stand upon the surface of the earth but are sunk into it, in 
their foundations, while above ground they contend with the atmospheric elements. 
Like trees, with their roots, branches, and canopies, buildings are no more on the 
earth than they are in the sky; they are rather simultaneously earthly and celestial. 
Indeed, it is only because they are of the earth that they are also of the sky (Ingold, 
2022: 157).
A habitable ground, then, is not a hard surface furnished with objects, as Gibson 
thought. It is rather a surface that is soft and permeable, allowing the elements of 
earth, air, and moisture, powered by the fire of the sun, to mix and mingle, creating 
thereby the conditions for living things to flourish (Ingold, 2011: 120–1). The pri­
mary condition of life is not solidity but flux. And for perceivers, immersed in the 
flux, the world is evidently not always ready and waiting. They have also to be ready 
and waiting for the world, attending to it in the sense of abiding with it and doing its 
bidding. There are thus two sides to attention. One side—with which Gibson is 
primarily concerned—has to do with perceptual attunement to the affordances of 
6  Anthropological Affordances

the environment. That’s when the world waits for you. The other side, of your wait­
ing for the world, is a matter of exposure. Literally, to be exposed means being 
pulled out of position.7 In this displaced condition, the sense of understanding—of 
having solid ground beneath your feet—is shaken, leaving you vulnerable and 
hyper-alert, wide-eyed in astonishment rather than narrowly focused on a target. 
This is not so much an understanding as an undergoing, which strips away the 
veneer of certainty wherein we find comfort and security, and opens to pure 
possibility.
6.5  Between Anticipation and Perception
To rebalance the theory of perception, we have to give equal weight to the two sides 
of attention, of exposure and attunement, of waiting on a worlding world and tuning 
in to a world-in-waiting. What, then, is the relation between them? There’s no doubt 
that to embark on any activity, be it to hunt and fish, to farm, to set sail, indeed to 
carry on almost any kind of livelihood on land or at sea, means putting one’s exis­
tence on the line. The safe course would be to stay put. To live, however, we have to 
get moving, to push the boat out into the current of a world-in-formation. Thus, all 
undergoing begins in exposure. But as it proceeds, skills of perception and action, 
born of practice and experience, begin to kick in. When walking, for example, we 
place ourselves at risk with every step, falling forward on one foot, tumbling into the 
void, only to regain our poise, albeit temporarily, as the other foot comes to land on 
the ground ahead. What commences with the vulnerability of exposure ends in the 
mastery of attunement, providing in turn the ground from which the walker can 
once again submit to the hazard of exposure, in an alternation that continues for as 
long as the walk goes on.
This alternation, I believe, is fundamental to all life. But it is also unidirectional. 
That is to say, in real life, submission leads and mastery follows; never the reverse 
(Ingold, 2015: 38–42). Where submission casts off into a world in becoming, setting 
us loose to fall, mastery restores our grip so we can keep going. The first is a moment 
of aspiration; the second a moment of prehension. Out in front, an aspirant anticipa­
tion feels its way forward, improvising a passage, while bringing up the rear is a 
prehensile perception already accustomed to the ways of the world and skilled in 
attending and responding to its affordances. And as submission gives way to mas­
tery, aspiration to prehension, anticipation to perception, and exposure to attun­
ement, there comes a turning point at which a tentative opening matures into a firm 
sense of direction. The Ancient Greeks had a word for this, namely kairos, denoting 
not just the moment that must be seized but the attention and responsiveness 
7 From the Latin ex- (“out”) plus -positio (“position”). “To open our eyes is to get a look at what is 
evident,” writes philosopher of education Jan Masschelein; “it is, as I would like to say, about 
being or becoming attentive, it is to expose oneself” (Masschelein, 2010: 46).

necessary to do so.8 It is the point when the archer, having bent his bow, releases the 
arrow toward its target, or when the weaver shoots the shuttle through the shed of 
the loom. The ability to catch this moment, and not to let it pass, is perhaps the 
greatest part of any craft skill.
In the foregoing, I have inserted two supplementary terms, namely “aspiration” 
and “anticipation.” Both call for some explanation. Literally, to aspire is to draw 
breath. Like breathing in to breathe out, aspiration gathers up the past in order to 
cast it forward, along a line of attention. Brimming with as yet undirected potential, 
aspiration anticipates the future, but does not predict it. Far from predetermining the 
final forms of things, or fixing their ultimate destinations, anticipation opens up a 
path and improvises a passage.9 It is, if you will, a seeing into the future rather than 
the projection of an end state in the present (Ingold, 2013: 69). Thus, where antici­
pation and aspiration lead (in exposure), perception and prehension follow (in attun­
ement). Might this offer a possible solution to another question often put to me, to 
which the answer, up to now, has proved elusive? The question is: where, in our 
thinking about perception, can we find a place for “imagination”? For those of a 
cognitivist persuasion, of course, this is a non-problem. For them, the percept is an 
image, a representation, and as such on the other side of the fence from the reality it 
purports to represent. Thus, to perceive is to imagine. But what if, with Gibson, we 
suppose that perception opens directly to the real? What happens to imagina­
tion then?
Gibson (1979: 255–6) lists imagining as one of a number of forms of awareness 
that “are not strictly perceptual”; others include dreaming and wishful thinking. 
There is, he says, a simple test for telling the perceptual and the non-perceptual 
apart. Reality is inexhaustible; the more you subject it to scrutiny, the more you will 
discover. Not so, however, with the image. For try as you might, you will never find 
in it more than the mind has already placed there.10 All you can do is add to it, by 
way of interpretation. Perceiving is to imagining, then, as discovery to interpretation 
(Ingold, 2022: 32). But do the real and the imaginary have to be thus split apart? 
Might they rather be unified at the very moment, in the alternation of life, when 
perception turns to anticipation, and prehension to aspiration? This is to think of 
imagination not as a power of mental representation, but as a way of living cre­
atively in a world that is not already created, already formed, but is itself crescent, 
always running ahead of itself. In excess of the crescent world over the objects left 
in its wake, affordance gives way to pure possibility. To inhabit this world, in per­
ception and imagination, is to participate from within in its self-making, its autopoi­
esis. And that, to my mind, is the calling of anthropology.
8 For a fuller discussion of kairos, see Hawhee (2004).
9 According to philosopher Jacques Derrida, to anticipate is “to take the initiative, to be out in front, 
to take (capere) in advance (ante)” (Derrida, 1993: 4).
10 In an essay first published in 1940, Jean-Paul Sartre had made an identical point: “No matter how 
long I may look at an image, I shall never find anything in it but what I put there.” Herein, he con­
tinued, lies the essential difference between an image and a perception, for in the latter “there is 
always, at each and every moment. Infinitely more than we see” (Sartre, 1972: 7–8).

Affordances and Social Normativity: 
Steps Toward an Integrative View
Manuel Heras-Escribano
7.1  Introduction
Affordances are everywhere in our everyday lives. From walking to grasping a mug 
or opening a door, bodily action opportunities are pervasive. But if they are so com­
mon to find (maybe they are the most common object of perception), how is it that 
they were formulated only a few decades ago? This has to do with the development 
of ecological psychology, of which affordances are their main concept. Since their 
inception in the 1970s through this new approach to the mind, affordances have 
been applied to several fields of study, from architecture and design (Rietveld et al., 
2015) to philosophy of mind (Chemero, 2009) and robotics (Gijón et al., 2013).
But for affordances to be proposed as an object of study, a new reformulation of 
perception and action was needed, and this is what ecological psychology is all 
about. Ecological psychology was created by James and Eleanor Gibson between 
the 1960s and the 1980s (Gibson, 1969, 1979). It was conceived as a reaction against 
both cognitivism and behaviorism: it rejected the idea of cognition as based on 
information-processing and representation-consuming mechanisms, but also the 
stimulus-response formula and the idea of perception as a passive reception of 
worldly impingements (Lobo et al., 2018). Ecological psychology was inspired by 
functionalist psychology and Jamesian pragmatism; hence, it considered that the 
starting point of the study of cognition was the organism–environment system, not 
the brain or the organism alone (Heft, 2001). The organism, an active explorer, 
engages with the environment thanks to ecological information, and this is why it 
perceives the available affordances. The idea of ecological information changes the 
traditional way of understanding perception (from a sensation-based account to an 
information-based account) and establishes the bedrock for an ecological method in 
experimental psychology (Richardson et al., 2008).

One of the main aspects of debate for ecological psychology is the relation of 
affordances with human socionormative practices. Several authors inside and out­
side the ecological approach aimed to reconcile the original Gibsonian understand­
ing of affordances, which is agent-centered, with the unavoidably social constitution 
of our cognitive capacities. James Gibson himself was aware of this, and even when 
he claimed that the cultural and the natural environments are the same one and that 
there are affordances with a social significance (Gibson, 1979), his death prevented 
him from developing these ideas. But some other authors continued this task of 
reuniting affordances and sociality. Paraphrasing Dewey, we are always immersed 
in a social environment: we are exposed to the evaluation of the members of our 
community, and we always receive some kind of social feedback from everything 
we individually do (Dewey, 1922/2007). If so, our way of dealing with affordances 
as individuals is also affected by this social dimension.
In this chapter, I offer the conceptual basis for establishing a comprehensive view 
of the entanglement of social norms and affordances from an ecological perspective. 
For this, I will focus on the connection among three key concepts: Costall’s idea of 
canonical affordances, my own views on social normativity, and Reed’s fields of 
promoted action. In Sect. 7.2, I will present the idea of canonical affordances. In 
Sect. 7.3, I will do the same with the idea of fields of promoted action. Section 7.4 
will focus on my own views on social normativity and how norms are related to 
affordances. Finally, Sect. 7.5 will offer a general view of the connection among 
these three concepts in order to illuminate how the individual perception and taking 
of affordances are modulated by our social and normative practices.
7.2  Ecological Psychology, Direct Perception, 
and Canonical Affordances
Ecological psychology is based on three main ideas: first, organisms are not merely 
passive receptors of stimuli, but active explorers of their environments. Second, the 
main unit of analysis is not the organism per se, but the organism–environment 
system. And third, perception is mainly of affordances, which are directly perceived. 
Regarding the first claim, ecological psychology conceives organisms as agents that 
are always acting upon their environments, modifying them and extracting informa­
tion that guides their action. Agents do not passively receive the impingements of 
the world: they navigate it and encounter it at all times. This shows the mutual affec­
tion between organism and environment: the organism affects the environment and 
the environment affects the organism, and if we adopt a diachronic perspective, we 
cannot fully understand organisms and their environments if we separate them. For 
this reason, ecological psychology does not focus on brains, nervous systems, or 
even organisms alone: this approach focuses on the unit or system formed by the 
organism and the environment. And this leads us to the third main claim: the direct 
perception of affordances.
M. Heras-Escribano

Affordances are the main objects of perception for organisms according to eco­
logical psychology. Affordances are peculiar objects of perception, as they are 
agent-related: mugs are perceived as graspable by humans (or apes) because of the 
combination of the cylindrical form of the mug itself and the ability to grasp of apes 
possess due to the opposable thumbs they have as part of their bodily equipment. 
This aspect of being properties of objects related to bodily and action capacities of 
organisms is what defines affordances. Another essential aspect that defines affor­
dances is that they are directly perceived. This is because the way in which the 
perception of affordances is studied is not based on sensations (which has to be 
processed so as to form a representation in the brain and/or the mind), but on eco­
logical information(Reed, 1991). This ecological information should not be con­
fused with information in the Shannon-Weaver sense of the word, which also 
implies information processing. According to James Gibson, perception does not 
work that way. In the ecological view, information for perception does not need to 
be processed, disambiguated, or enriched to form a representation that replicates the 
environment (Turvey et  al., 1981). On the contrary, ecological information is 
directly detected, and it is necessary and sufficient to perceive the environment as 
such—no representations or any other kinds of mediations are needed (Reed, 1996). 
Ecological information is the result of the energy arrays of the environment forming 
a heterogeneous pattern (due to reverberations in a given space) such that it reveals 
the surfaces of the environment and the available affordances (Glotzbach & Heft, 
1982). Take, for example, a room in which a light bulb is shining: the light fills the 
medium (the air) with ambient light as rays of light reflect in the surfaces of the 
room, forming a structure that corresponds to the structure of the objects and sur­
faces of the room. The pattern is informative of the structure of the room itself. The 
organism encounters this informational structure, and this is enough for perceiving 
the room and its affordances directly from a given location or point of view. There 
is no need to postulate any kind of processing mechanism, representations, or any 
other kind of mediational entity or process for perceiving affordances (Chemero, 
2009; Heras-Escribano, 2019).
Ecological information specifies the environment and its affordances because the 
informational pattern takes the structure of the environment, so the structure of the 
information corresponds to the structure of the environment. In this sense, the sole 
presence of ecological information is sufficient to perceive the available affor­
dances. If there is a mug in the room and the organism that observes the room is one 
with opposable thumbs, ecological information specifies the possibility of grasping 
the affordance for that organism (Turvey, 2019).
As we can see, there is no need to appeal to either sensations or representations 
to explain how affordances are directly perceived. Unlike behaviorism, cognitivism, 
or enactivism, ecological psychology does not refer to sensations that need to be 
transformed or processed. It relies on information on the structure of the ambient 
optic array that reveals the shape of the environment that the organism is exploring. 
This is why the ambient optic array is informative about the environment: it is eco­
logical information of the available affordances because that pattern or array is 
related to the bodily dimensions and abilities of the organisms that perceive the

64
environment. Perception is based on ecological information, not on sensations—
and this is why it is directly detected.
We can see that affordances, being agent-related aspects of the environment, cut 
across the dichotomy between subjective and objective. However, according to 
Costall (1995), there is one dichotomy that Gibson could not overcome: the dichot­
omy of the natural and the sociocultural. This is because, according to Costall, 
Gibson aimed to explain perception as a universal trait of organisms, but he did not 
emphasize the fundamental contribution of sociality in the picture: he presented 
direct perception as essentially asocial (Costall, 1995: 474). Costall aimed to social­
ize affordances by including in the picture the essential social aspects that shape our 
cognition, which is the difference that humans make in nature (Costall, 1995: 478). 
One example of this is the introduction of the idea of canonical affordances as 
opposed to affordances in general. While affordances in general are available every­
where, canonical affordances are conventional and normative (Costall, 2012). This 
is why canonical affordances, according to Costall, are so tightly related to artifacts: 
technological objects are designed so as to facilitate one particular affordance, and 
this facilitation is shaped by our own sociocultural norms. For example, chairs are 
specifically designed to be sat on, and although they can afford some other actions 
(throwing them, for example), they are perceived as sit-on-able objects because our 
sociocultural background emphasizes that use. Just like we predefine the use of a 
technological artifact, we also predefine its affordances; or better: it is because we 
predefine in a normative way the affordances that a technological object has that we 
define the technological object per se. As Costall claimed: “The concept of canoni­
cal affordances itself alerts us to those important cases where the affordances of 
something are not simply shared between people but also normatively predefined” 
(Costall, 2012: 91). Normative predefinition has a major distinctive prescriptive 
force than merely sharing something: while sharedness could imply the random 
establishment of a convention (think of, for example, the way in which humans 
randomly create walkways or tracks that are followed spontaneously until they 
become part of the landscape), the normative predefinition implies a well-thought, 
deliberate previous step of thinking of the design of the artifact so as to optimize its 
usability—and this implies a designer that has considered what affordances they 
wish to make salient, hence the idea that some technological objects or devices have 
a function that is shown via their affordances. This is shown through the claim that 
“[a] theoretical understanding of canonical affordances will not be achieved by 
fixation upon the object in isolation, nor the individual-object dyad. The object 
needs to be understood within a network of relations not only among different peo­
ple, but also a constellation of other objects drawn into a shared practice” (Costall, 
2012: 92). The canon of canonical affordances is deliberate and socially shaped: not 
in the sense that all affordances are social, but in the sense in which sociality is part 
of reality—having a role that is as important as ecological information (Costall, 
1995: 478). In this sense, “[c]anonical affordances still imply us, but in the plurality 
rather than the singular” (Costall & Richards, 2013: 87), and this plurality is consti­
tuted by social norms.
M. Heras-Escribano

65
The introduction of sociality within the picture of the direct perception of affor­
dances raises several questions: how intricate is the connection between social 
norms and affordances? Are there canonical affordances beyond the case of techno­
logical artifacts or devices? If so, how are they established if it is not by design? 
These questions will be dealt with in the upcoming sections. In the next one, we will 
take a look at Reed’s fields of promoted action.
7.3  Reed’s Fields of Promoted Action
The philosopher E. S. Reed aimed to explore all the implications of ecological psy­
chology to the philosophy of mind. For that, he took into account the importance of 
development, and the work of Eleanor Gibson was key for that field. She aimed to 
analyze psychological development from an ecological standpoint, and her contri­
butions to the field were outstanding. Reed applied that developmental view to his 
philosophical writings, and the results were exceptional. Among all the contribu­
tions, for the purposes of this chapter, we can highlight the idea of fields of pro­
moted action as a key aspect of any child’s development. He defined the idea in the 
following way:
The field of promoted action includes all the affordances made available to or emphasized 
for the child by other people and excludes those affordances forbidden to the child by other 
people. The field of promoted action also includes those different actions that are encour­
aged or even scaffolded for the infant at different times (e.g., aiding to help sit or stand). The 
field of promoted action is a powerful force in human development, but it cannot shape the 
infant except through the windows of these interactive frames (Reed, 1996: 130).
So, as we can see, fields of promoted action emerge during the interaction of the 
infant and the adult in interactive frames. Reed establishes different interactive 
frames: the primal one (0–3 months), in which facial expressions and gaze at anoth­
er’s face is key; the performatory frame (3–9 months), in which infants start to see 
themselves as agents and show appreciation for different surfaces, substances, and 
textures, which leads to free action and learning about affordances; and the true 
interaction frame (3–9 months), in which the infant’s response to caregiver activity 
(gazes, movements, but also speech) is crucial, as “infants will come to shape their 
behavior according to local cultural proprieties, for these proprieties will define how 
effective their gazes, smiles, and vocalizations are at eliciting interaction” (Reed, 
1996: 133). In this period, from 3 to 9 months, interaction becomes crucial for 
understanding the infant’s behavior:
In the period from 3 to 9 months, human infants are becoming complete interactors—ones 
who combine vocalization and bodily movements with face-to-face interaction. They are 
beginning to make their own choices as to whether or not to interact. They are starting to 
master the intricate art of turn taking, the first of the complex of reciprocities that are neces­
sary for successful social interaction. They have become game players, who not only 
undergo affective surges but do so in a shared context, linking the phases of their actions 
with those of their caregivers (Reed, 1996: 135).

66
These interactive frames are crucial for shaping the basic agency of human beings 
in their development. These are the frames in which human nature becomes sensi­
tive to sociality, hence including this aspect as an essential feature of our way of 
being agents in the world. According to Reed, it is in these interaction frames in 
which the fields of promoted action appear, and they are presented to the agent as 
social invitations or prohibitions (implicit or explicit) for taking particular affor­
dances (among other things). In this sense, sociality systematizes the infants’ taking 
of affordances by exerting social pressures for promoting the taking of some affor­
dances and the prohibition of taking some others, all of this because of purely socio­
normative reasons.
My proposal here is to expand Reed’s idea of fields of promoted action beyond 
infancy. I think these fields of promoted action are clearly present not only during 
development, but also in our everyday lives. We humans are always learning until 
we die, and every agent is constantly learning how to engage in particular situations 
in a more efficient way; thus, we must recognize that our experience of fields of 
promoted action continues to evolve across our lifespan. For this, the agent makes 
use of both the responsiveness to affordances and the responsiveness to social 
norms. There is a triadic interaction (to use Reed’s apt phrase) for making sense of 
human nature in its completitude. And the framework of fields of promoted action 
is very useful when it comes to understanding the interaction of norms and affor­
dances. These fields of promoted action should be understood as the specific con­
texts of interaction in which social norms are exerting their pressure; agents aim to 
act in the right way and, for that purpose, they make use of the available affor­
dances. We find these frameworks for triadic interaction full of affordances and 
fields of promoted action constantly, so it is important to analyze how social norms 
and affordances are entangled. But, for that purpose, it is important to offer a clear 
definition of social norms.
7.4  Social Norms
Social norms are pervasive in our everyday lives. There are several appeals to social 
normativity by philosophers of mind and social cognition, but there are only a few 
definitions of what these social norms are. I have tried in some previous writings to 
offer a systematic definition of social normativity in human nature starting from the 
work of some authors in the pragmatist and post-analytic traditions, such as Dewey, 
Ryle, or Wittgenstein (Heras-Escribano, 2019; Heras-Escribano & de Pinedo-­
García, 2018). Here I show the main aspects of this view on social normativity.1
1 In previous writings I have also analyzed the difference between the normative and the nomologi­
cal, where I stated that the title “normativity” should be restricted to a social phenomenon and that 
we should not confuse the peculiar aspects of social normativity with non-social aspects that, while 
labeled as normative as well, they refer to subpersonal lawful regularities. For a detailed discussion 
on the issue, see Heras-Escribano (2020a, b), Raja and Chemero (2020), and Mojica (2020).

First of all, it is worth distinguishing between being right and being successful. 
My point with this is that the success–failure distinction does not exhaust the right–
wrong distinction: we apply the predicate “successful” when a goal is achieved, but 
we reserve the predicate “right” when a goal is achieved correctly. This means that, 
among all possible ways to succeed, there is one that is the right one. And the impact 
of this distinction for agency is key because in this picture an agent becomes aware 
of how he or she is acting: the agent acquires epistemic responsibility for his or her 
actions. This is because someone who does the right thing is normally aware of her 
way of doing things and also because she aims to act in that way. In this picture, 
normative practices are equated with rational or intelligent practices, as the agent 
willingly aims to do things right, acquiring that responsibility for her performance. 
This is something stressed by authors such as Ryle:
The well-regulated clock keeps good time and the well-drilled circus seal performs its tricks 
flawlessly, yet we do not call them ‘intelligent’. We reserve this title for the persons respon­
sible for their performances. To be intelligent is not merely to satisfy criteria, but to apply 
them; to regulate one’s actions and not merely to be well-regulated (Ryle, 1949/2009: 17).
So, when an organism is aiming to act in a right or correct way, this means that the 
organism is aware of a certain norm or procedure and aims to act accordingly, which 
means that the agent acquires certain responsibility in her performance via social 
attribution or expectancy (although it can be self-ascribed as well, but first you have 
to be part of a social environment for acquiring this capacity of self-ascribing one­
self an epistemic responsibility regarding the following of social norms). This 
acquisition of epistemic responsibility for doing the right thing when following a 
rule implies that the agent is rational or intelligent. This attribution of intelligence 
should not be understood in the intellectualist way, i.e., the way in which agents 
follow norms as if they repeat an explicit general instruction in their heads, leaving 
aside the particularities of the surrounding situation. We are intelligent not because 
we repeat general maxims in our head and follow them blindly, but because we 
acquire responsibility for our performances and aim to act rightly, taking into 
account the particularities of our current situation. As Ryle (1949/2009: 41) claimed, 
“understanding is a part of knowing how,” which means that understanding is highly 
practical, that we are situated and the exercise of our cognitive capacities is 
context-sensitive.
Regarding this point, I proposed the idea of pertinence as key for understanding 
how social normativity is situated and highly practical. Once we acknowledge that 
norm-following is always online or situated, then we realize that being sensitive to 
the particularities of the context is an essential aspect of human agency. Then, the 
triadic interaction of agents, norms, and affordances demands a specific notion for 
evaluating an agent’s performance. This comes with the idea of pertinence: one 
action would be more or less pertinent depending on a combination of the aim or 
goal to be achieved, the layout of the environment, and the correctness of the action 
according to the rules being followed for achieving the goal. Thus, “pertinence” is a 
key notion for describing normative actions because of its usefulness to assess the 
adequacy of a particular action given the goal, the norms, and the constraints and

facilitations of the environment. We claim that an action is “pertinent” when such 
action fulfills its goal by applying the correctness criteria in a successful way, solv­
ing the problems offered by the specific particularities of the environment. This is 
why the pertinence of an action is always context-dependent.
In sum, all human actions are subjected to social scrutiny since the earliest stages 
of human cognitive development, and they never cease to be. As Dewey claimed, 
“[s]ome activity proceeds from a man; then it sets up reactions in the surroundings. 
Others approve, disapprove, protest, encourage, share and resist” (Dewey, 
1922/2007: 16–7). Individual behavior is shaped by these social reactions, which 
means that, in general, individual habits are formed through these socionormative 
institutions that shape the individual’s dispositions, and tendencies to act in a certain 
way (Dewey, 1922/2007: 58). As we can see, a systematized approach to the main 
features of social normativity allows us to understand the main details of this phe­
nomenon. Social norms are present since the earliest stages of our cognitive devel­
opment, and they shape our behavior in the form of pressures and encouragements 
that promote social conformism in individual behavior.
7.5  Integrating Social Norms, Canonical Affordances, 
and Fields of Promoted Action
How can we disentangle the intricacy of affordances and social norms in our every­
day life? From a first-person point of view, the direct perception of affordances and 
the social pressures for norm-following happen at the same time, but we should 
understand how they interact. As I wrote before, several questions arise: Are there 
canonical affordances beyond the case of technological artifacts or devices? How do 
social norms affect our dealing with affordances? Do fields of promoted action 
make us “blind” to certain affordances?
Regarding the first question, I think that the expansion of fields of promoted 
action to our everyday lives can be useful for illuminating whether there are canoni­
cal affordances beyond technological devices. In this view, if fields of promoted 
action are present everywhere (because social norms and affordances share the 
same space from a first-person perspective), then it is possible to establish canonical 
uses of affordances via social pressures and beyond technological devices. Thus, the 
constant pressure or promotion of certain affordances exerted by particular socio­
cultural norms or conventions produces the establishment of a canon for taking one 
affordance instead of another. To illustrate this, we could imagine context-­dependent 
cases in which politically oppressed people perceive the throwability of stones as 
more salient than some other affordances for defending themselves from a tyranni­
cal government, or that thousands of years ago, in the same scenario, the same 
stones could have been regarded as a source for making fire but not as a weapon for 
a hunter-gatherer community. In these examples, the stones remain the same, but in 
each example a different affordance is prioritized, and this prioritization is clearly 
M. Heras-Escribano

69
socially shaped and socially established. In all cases, the behavioral output of an 
individual is subjected to social evaluations, which applies to the taking of affor­
dances. So imagine, with this, that the above-mentioned hunter-gatherer population 
discovers the use of rocks for making fire, and that given the scarcity of rocks in 
their environment it is established that the use of rocks is restricted to making fire, 
so they cannot use them as weapons to be thrown. Also, we could imagine that, 
eventually, the following generations would not feel inclined to use rocks as weap­
ons because such use is not promoted or even regulated by the community. In this 
sense, canonical affordances are established when the society knows how to do 
something correctly in the most efficient way: this sets up the scenario with pre­
scriptive force in which the agent aims to do the right thing and learns how to do it 
efficiently with practice. In sum, social norms work as pressure mechanisms that 
urge or encourage us to take some affordances instead of others. This is useful to 
understand how canonical affordances are established: they are not established or 
determined due to particular aspects of the object itself, but because of the very 
social norms that need to be followed in particular contexts. This can be obvious in 
the case of technological objects, as they are designed to satisfy particular norms. 
However, what is canonical may change in different contexts and depending on 
human needs or conventions.
As we can see, with the expansion of fields of promoted action beyond infancy 
and development, we can claim that there are different fields of promoted action that 
depend on different socionormative contexts. These fields of promoted action are 
the product of a particular engagement between agents regarding a particular social 
norm or a set of social norms. In this sense, the time frame of a particular field of 
promoted action is shaped by a particular social norm that is being followed at a 
particular time, and since agents aim to follow that norm to fulfill a goal, agents 
exclusively pay attention in those contexts to the affordances that allow us to act in 
the right way. The aspect of attention is important: given that every task is goal-­
directed, the attention of the agent is directed toward what is important to satisfy the 
goal correctly. Thus, the norm itself pushes the agent toward paying attention to the 
affordances that are relevant to satisfy the goal correctly. Thus, agents not only learn 
to act normatively in a more efficient way making use of particular affordances, 
which establishes a particular canonical use of them, but also educate their attention 
to look for the suitable affordances that allow them to perform that action. It is 
important to emphasize that the object of perception, the affordance, is not modified 
by social norms: what social norms do is to modulate our focus of attention so that 
we pay attention to some affordances instead of others. In this sense, social norms 
exert pressure in the repertoire of exploratory patterns to make us focus on the affor­
dances that are relevant for following the norm. The rest of the affordances become 
irrelevant; hence, agents are said to be “blind” to the affordances that are not rele­
vant to the goal the agent is pursuing.

7.6  Conclusion
In this chapter, I aimed to begin disentangling the concepts of social norms and 
affordances. From a first-person perspective, our everyday experience provides us 
with different available social norms and affordances. They share the same space, 
and they are equally demanding. Even when they are different (social norms are 
conventional and affordances are perceptual), they are equally real to us, just like 
Costall claimed. I tried to illuminate some aspects of how both are related in our 
experience through the analysis of the connections among them with the idea of 
Reed’s fields of promoted action. For this, I expanded fields of promoted action 
from infant development to everyday experience: I think this move is reasonable 
because humans are always trying to improve their performance and learning how 
to follow norms and take affordances more efficiently. The idea of fields of pro­
moted action could serve to highlight how social norms act like pressures for taking 
some affordances in different normative contexts, establishing canonical uses of 
affordances depending on the situation and the norm to be followed, and then edu­
cating our attention toward some specific affordances instead of some others (the 
ones that are relevant for satisfying a norm correctly). It is only by analyzing in 
detail how affordances and norms coexist and mutually affect each other that we can 
integrate these concepts under a single explanatory framework that does justice to 
our everyday experience.2

8.1  Toward a Viable Development of the Built Environment?
The position of the architect-engineer is a difficult spot. As voiced repeatedly since 
1972, we build and demolish too much while the planet, plants, and animals are 
suffering, and many are still without worthy living conditions (Meadows et  al., 
1972). Inevitably we need to arrive at improved resourcefulness, understood as an 
inventive and just use of the scarce resources available. In the case of architecture, 
such resourcefulness implies an improved correspondence between the physical 
resources applied in the engineering of construction and the ability of this same 
construction to support and enrich sustainable everyday life practices by means of 
its spatial capacities. These are capacities that are signified by delicate atmospheres 
as stated by German philosopher Gernot Böhme (2006), with the potential to pro­
foundly impact our physical and psychological well-being as stated in recent 
research into the neuroscientific implications of architecture (Djebbara et al., 2021). 
However, whereas significant advances are achieved in the engineering of tools for 
measuring the material emission of construction as such, architects struggle to 
describe and position the possible long-term value stemming from the potential of 
these spatial capacities to support and enrich sustainable everyday life practices 
related to these hard measures (Beim & Hvejsel, 2019). Outlining an ecological 
correspondence between animal and environment, the notion of affordances coined 
by American psychologist James J. Gibson in describing that which the environ­
ment “offers the animal” marks a critical direction in this matter (Gibson, 1986, 
p. 127). In approaching a translation of the notion of affordances into architecture, 
Gibson states that architects are aware of how a surface at knee height affords sitting

on it, and “a glass wall affords seeing through but not walking through,” but he 
concludes that we “lack a theory of affordances to encompass them in a system” 
(Gibson, 1986, p. 137).
In my perception, one of the finest examples of such affordance in architecture 
can be found in the sweeping plywood wall in Swedish architect Erik Gunnar 
Asplund’s Woodland Crematorium Waiting Room, from 1940. As the wall sweeps 
out in a soft curvature at knee height, it forms a kind and supportive, almost human 
gesture, affording a sitting place in the most difficult situations. I hypothesize that 
two complementary long-term trajectories toward improved resourcefulness of the 
built environment can be identified in such gestures. First, they hold the potential to 
support our commitment to care for and repair constructions instead of demolishing 
them, resulting in improved resourcefulness at an environment-economic scale 
(Andersen & Hvejsel, 2022). Second, they hold the potential to support our indi­
vidual well-being and ability to share constructions collectively, resulting in 
improved resourcefulness at a socio-economic scale (Sántha et al., 2022). If so, the 
notion of gesture presents itself as a possible key concept in mobilizing the theory 
of affordances within architecture, by referring the spatial language of construction 
explicitly to human body language. However, encompassing this theory systemati­
cally into our practice, as called for by Gibson, does not only entail an exploration 
of the architectural question of what such gestures potentially afford in terms of 
spatial perception, accounted for in detail by German architect Angelika Jäkel 
(2013). Simultaneously, it necessitates navigating its dependence with the engineer­
ing question of what gestures we can actually afford with the resources available in 
the technical realization of construction. By posing the question, what gestures (can 
we) afford, this chapter uses tectonic theory in an attempt at formulating a method 
for critically linking and navigating the two concepts toward an improved resource­
fulness of construction.
8.2  Unfolding the Tectonic Potentials of “Gesture”
With reference to the ecological and contextual task of the Greek tekton in bringing 
together esthetics and technique, seminal scholars such as American architects 
Eduard F. Sekler and Kenneth Frampton, and Danish architect Anne Beim, have 
reintroduced and developed the potential of tectonic theory as a critical entrance to 
contemporary architectural practice integral to the engineering of construction 
(Sekler, 1965; Frampton, 1995; Beim & Madsen, 2014). Hence, a direction to 
describe the task of the contemporary architect-engineer within a resourceful cor­
respondence of place and everyday life facilitated by construction is implied within 
the notion of tectonics. Building upon this implication and seeking principles to 
exemplify and mobilize it, this chapter employs the notion of gesture as a lens 
through which to zoom in and describe the conditions for improving this 
correspondence.

Describing “the employment of bodily movements, attitudes, expression of 
countenance, etc., as a means of giving effect to oratory,” the notion of gesture was 
recorded already in 1410 among the first 15% words to appear in the dictionary 
(Oxford English Dictionary, 2011). Notably, the notion of gesture has, as pointed 
out by Danish philosopher Niels Albertsen, been applied by Austrian philosopher 
Ludwig Wittgenstein in defining architecture (Albertsen, 2012). “Good architecture 
is recognized in its ability to express a thought. Making you want to answer with a 
gesture” (Wittgenstein, 1980/1931, p. 22), Wittgenstein observed in 1931, follow­
ing up in 1942, by summarizing that “architecture is gesture. Not all appropriate 
movements of the human body are gestures. Just as every building is not architec­
ture” (Wittgenstein, 1980/1942, p. 42). However, by employing the notion of ges­
ture here, it is not the intention to embark upon a theoretical discussion of what 
architecture is or should be, rather, it is to help point to practical design directions 
for what architecture can and should do.1 Hence, whereas the notion is widely used 
in architecture, exemplified by Italian architect Gennaro Postiglione, designer 
Eleonora Lupo (Postiglione & Lupo, 2007) as well as Jäkel (2013), the focus here 
is to discuss the methodological potentials of gesture, toward building critical the­
ory for practice in the necessary, tectonic integration of human and material 
resources discussed above.
8.3  What ‘Gestures’ Afford?
By transferring the notion of gesture, referring to human body language, onto the 
spatial language of architecture as suggested in this chapter, a potential to clarify the 
responsibility and field of action of the architect related to that of envisioning and 
prioritizing the possible affordances of construction can be observed. As stated by 
Gibson, an affordance of the environment “that is commensurate with the body of 
the observer himself is more easily picked up than one that is not commensurate 
with his body” (Gibson, 1986, p. 143). In this regard, gesture presents itself as a 
critical means for the architect, entailing a constant reminder of this commensurate­
ness with the human body; gesture represents a potential to insist upon an under­
standing of architecture as a verb, as called for by American-Italian architect Sarah 
Robinson (2021), as the notion places the purposefulness of architecture explicitly 
outside the work itself. Entailing an embodiment, so to speak, of Robinson’s account 
for the potential of architecture as a verb, gesture also entails a materialization of the 
necessary discussion of what architecture attempts to do, or afford if following 
Gibson, by means of its spatial capacities. Part language, part form, gesture is read­
ily identifiable as the materialization of an intentional expression by the architect, as 
1 In this matter, the essay is part of a trajectory of research within the field of tectonics in architec­
ture, exploring the methodological potentials of gesture, toward improving the resourcefulness of 
the built environment (Andersen & Hvejsel, 2022; Beim & Hvejsel, 2019; Hvejsel, 2011, 2018; 
Sántha et al., 2022).

in the case of Asplund’s sweeping plywood wall. And when analyzed as gesture, as 
outlined in Hvejsel (2011, pp. 74–123) and Jäkel (2013, pp. 257–263), we discover 
that the practice of sitting as such does not suffice in stating the affordances result­
ing from Asplund’s expression. The compassion and care for the individual con­
tained within the gesture hereby become a social relief, also for mourners 
collectively, as they are sustained bodily toward mutual support. In this way, the 
gesture unfolds a physical potential to reduce the material resources spent in con­
struction by expanding the perception of confined spaces and inviting us toward 
improved ways of sharing constructions without feeling squeezed. Finally, we are 
motivated to care for and repair constructions that have grown meaningful to us 
because of their resourcefulness, related to our actual needs across generations 
(Andersen & Hvejsel, 2022). Thus, rather than mere practicalities such as sitting, 
gestures like Asplund’s voice an opportunity to collect evidence for how the spatial 
capacities of architecture can support and enrich sustainable, everyday life practices 
exactly by materializing the ability of architecture to move us beyond practicality. 
In this way, gesture outlines a direction toward critical application of the body of 
knowledge comprising architectural theory in practice by enabling a physical refer­
ence to the atmospheres, which signify the phenomenological correspondence 
between us and the built, intentional expressions voiced physically through con­
struction (Böhme, 2006; Norberg-Schulz, 1985; Pallasmaa, 1996). As it is rather the 
compassion, kindness, and support expressed in Asplund’s gesture that is primary 
and active in eventually affording sitting and hereby the relief of rest, gesture herein 
implies a potential by the architect to clearly communicate the delicate, atmospheric 
potentials of architecture beyond our field-specific knowledge. Kind and supportive 
gestures like Asplund’s are thus likely to hold critical, long-term potentials toward 
motivating sustainable, everyday life practices at a socio-economic, as well as an 
environment-economic scale, by asking of us to improve our compassion as well as 
our abilities in care, repair, and sharing of the constructions that make up the built 
environment (Andersen & Hvejsel, 2022). However, as discussed in Sántha et al. 
(2022), the short-term economic focus on construction costs, and the quest to 
decrease emission measures in this process, often tend to dominate the decisions 
made in architectural practice, making it difficult for the architect to render probable 
the resourceful, long-term perspectives of gestures like Asplund’s. Thus, while 
expanding upon what gestures afford, we simultaneously need to raise the question:
8.4  What “Gestures” Can We Afford?
If we read further into the dictionary description, it appears that the meaning of 
gesture is twofold, capturing the meanings: “a move or course of action undertaken 
as an expression of feeling” and the form of a desired “response from another” 
(Oxford English Dictionary, 2011). This dual meaning of gesture is of significance 
when it comes to the tectonic challenge of arriving at a resourceful correspondence 
between human and material resources in construction—between the architectural

imagination of spatial gestures and the engineering of technical principles support­
ing them. Symptomatically, Austrian-American architect Eduard F. Sekler employed 
the notion of gesture in distinguishing tectonics from structure, and the practice of 
construction as such, in his seminal essay Structure, Construction, Tectonics from 
1965. Sekler did so by describing the task of the architect as that of tectonically 
expressing a “noble gesture which makes visible a play of forces, of load and sup­
port in column and entablature, calling forth our empathetic participation in the 
experience” (Sekler, 1965, p. 92). In relating Sekler’s account of the tectonic to the 
dictionary description of gesture, we observe a parallel in which the spatial capaci­
ties of construction cannot be described independently of the technical, engineering 
principles employed in its realization (Hvejsel, 2018). In the case of Asplund’s ges­
ture, the resourceful application of the bending principle is inherent in the structural 
capacities of plywood. In this way, Sekler aligns with Wittgenstein’s association of 
the gesture with architecture, in the sense that, to Sekler, gesture also distinguishes 
the engineering of architecture from mere construction “through tectonics” (Sekler, 
1965, p. 92). With this expression, Sekler implies a responsibility of the engineer 
toward artistically communicating realities, hereby tying the gesture directly to the 
question of what and how our constructions afford. Hence, if continuing Sekler’s 
line of thinking, a reverse approach to Gibson’s notion of affordance as “that which 
the environment offers the animal” (Gibson, 1986, p. 127) is suggested, requiring 
the architect-engineer to simultaneously account for that which the animal offers 
the environment. Read in this way, we understand that it is Asplund’s ethical aware­
ness of the reality of the environmental purpose of the crematorium that eventually 
renders its gestures durable as a construction over time. As stated by Bengt 
O. H. Johansson in his analysis of the Woodland Cemetery, it “turns the mourners’ 
attention toward nature, in order thus to dissolve their grief and be reconciled to it. 
Although the words were not in use at the time, the great circle of life is what it is 
all about” (Johansson, 1996, p. 108). Hence, in addressing the question: “what ges­
tures can we afford?” tectonic theory implies a direction for grasping the reality of 
the ecological load that construction must support as a place-making gesture to 
reconcile human and material resources through construction. If recalling the inter­
twined social, economic, and environmental challenges currently facing the devel­
opment of the built environment, this long-term responsibility of place is a load that 
must be accounted for in relation to the immediate costs and emissions affiliated 
with construction as such. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben’s affiliation of ges­
ture with wider ethical considerations is central in this regard, as he recalls the sig­
nificance of gesture as a measure of our cultural credibility and social competencies. 
In this matter, Agamben states that the characteristics of gesture are “that in it there 
is neither production nor enactment, but undertaking and supporting” (Agamben, 
2000/1991, p. 140), hereby committing our gestures to an ongoing analysis of the 
reality of what we need and can afford, given the scarcity of resources that we have 
available.

8.5  Perspectives of “Gesture” for Integrated Architecture 
and Engineering Research, Education, and Practice
If summarizing, gestures like Asplund’s, whether realized inside or outside, unfold 
small-scale yet real-life laboratories through which to exchange and grow knowl­
edge toward gradual improvement of the affordances of the built environment. 
Being open to interpretation across disciplines beyond architecture and engineering, 
as well as culture, age, gender, and levels of experience related to the built environ­
ment, while simultaneously being measurable as built realities of a certain environ­
mental and economic cost, they mark a critical methodological potential for 
integrated architecture and engineering across research, education, and practice. 
Hence, as interdisciplinary laboratories, the concept of gestures opens a potential to 
study whether and how critical and aware spatial intentions communicated through 
architectural construction are responded to by users, in the form of lived gestures in 
their experience and behavior, and at what environmental and economic expense 
(Sántha et al., 2022). In this way, subtle yet critical gestures like Asplund’s ulti­
mately offer a focused and systematic entry to studies of the wider ethical implica­
tions of this behavior, related to the improvement of the resourcefulness of the built 
environment in general.
In my work, I experience optimistically how developing architect-engineers are 
capable of systematically formulating and constructing gestures, creating a space of 
action for architecture to respond to and act upon wider ethical implications. In this 
regard, Fig. 8.1 exemplifies how such gestures can be active in empowering people 
to gain a foothold on the edge. The project illustrates the critical choice by the stu­
dents to transform an abandoned water reservoir in Paris into transitional housing 
for the homeless, joined through long-term perspectives for active participation in 
communal activities and facilities such as a community kitchen, a library, and per­
forming arts workshops, commenced simultaneously with the hosting of the 2024 
Olympics’ cultural program. When you are without a physical home, your home is 
the friend you hang out with on the street, as the students found in their analysis; 
therefore, the transitional housing is designed to gesture pairs and groups. In 
Fig. 8.2, the students have developed the principles to transform a housing block, 
otherwise destined for demolition, without the inhabitants needing to move. On the 
contrary, they are empowered to take part in the construction process, their first job 
becoming the dignifying gesture to participate in the transformation of their dwell­
ing in accordance with everyday practices and needs. This socio-tectonic process is 
made possible by the in-depth knowledge acquired by the students about the exist­
ing construction principles and their potential resources for future gestures, such as 
in the transformation of a left-over shaft into a unique and dignifying bath.
In conclusion, this chapter argues that when understood as being tectonically 
integral to the engineered reality of construction, gesture presents itself as a key 
concept in mobilizing the theory of affordances as a critical method toward improved 
resourcefulness in the built environment. At a conceptual and analytical level,

gesture herein implies a systematic correspondence between that which we intend 
our constructions to afford and for whom, and the technical realities of how our 
constructions afford and with what resources. Simultaneously identifiable as physi­
cal realities, gestures like Asplund’s represent a positive potential as small-scale, 
real-life laboratories, across research, education, and practice, to explore and expand 
design directions for what architecture can and should do.

Affordances and Atmospheres

9.1  The Crucial Role of Affordances
Let’s imagine the entrance hall of a major banking institution, with its pretentious 
decorations and furnishings, fine paintings and sculptures, and an imposing marble 
staircase in the middle, surrounded by neoclassical columns. This certainly impres­
sive lived space may express (i) an antagonistic atmosphere of power for those who 
venture there in search of a loan (whence the impulse to move slowly and warily, to 
leave the center of the room and take refuge in protective nooks and crannies), and 
(ii) a syntonic atmosphere of proud belonging for an employee who has developed 
a strong esprit de corps (whence their proud strut in the middle of the hall). This 
example clarifies, against any projectivistic relativism, that different atmospheric 
feelings (or, better, moods) are just relatively different felt-bodily filterings and 
resonances to the same quasi-objective and first-impression atmosphere that I call 
prototypical.1 Of course, this is the case as long as—with a closer analogy with 
qualitative invariants such as James Gibson’s affordance (1986) and, before that, 
Kurt Lewin’s Aufforderungscharakter (valence) (1936, 166), Kurt Koffka’s 
1 Without fully embracing the radical neo-phenomenological campaign of desubjectification of all 
feelings initiated by Hermann Schmitz in the 1960s (for an introduction to this philosophical 
stance, see Schmitz, 2019), I prefer to admit (at least since Griffero, 2014, 144) that there are three 
different types of atmospheres: prototypical atmospheres (objective, external, and unintentional, 
sometimes lacking a precise name), derivative-relational ones (objective, external, and sometimes 
intentionally produced as well as dependent on the subject/world relationship), and even some that 
are spurious because of their relatedness (subjective and projective, that is, also related to single 
objects and projected by the subject to the outside world).

physiognomic character (1936, 359–367) and especially Wolfgang Metzger’s 
Wesen (1941, 61–70)2—the atmosphere does not completely change based on the 
observer’s needs and dispositions, and as long as it cannot be fully explained by 
social practices and cultural conventions. The bank’s prototypical atmosphere 
imposes its affective salience, namely an architectural atmosphere of imposing vast­
ness and impressive authority, by triggering both (i) shyness and (ii) pride, obvi­
ously among other more nuanced resonance effects. It does so thanks to the 
expressive affordance (refusal/invitation) inherent to its material-symbolic ele­
ments. This simple example3 already shows the crucial role of affordance theory 
within my own aesthetic phenomenology of atmospheres (atmospherology). 
Nevertheless, when I suggested, at first rather roughly, a link between atmospherol­
ogy4 and the ecological theory of affordances5 (Griffero, 2014, 47–54), I was cer­
tainly not yet fully aware of the constructive interaction—indeed, almost an elective 
affinity—between the two notions.
The aim of this essay is to explain atmospheric feelings as qualities supervening 
on expressive affordances (i.e., environmental qualities influencing the mood of the 
recipient emotionally) and at least partly resulting from the not necessarily prag­
matic effect of more or less convergent systems of them. First, however, let me 
briefly explain what I mean by atmosphere.6 Despite its both ontological and epis­
temological uncertainty (much like that of affordance), this concept has gained 
increasing relevance in all the Humanities that have subscribed to the affective- and 
embodiment-turn. An atmosphere is that something more one senses or perceives7 
in the air, that is, a feeling poured out into a certain (pre-dimensional) space, inex­
tricably linked to felt-bodily resonances and whose qualitative holistic-mesoscopic 
2 Provided that “the properties of essence [or being; NdA] are neither subjective in the local sense 
nor in the causal sense,” and have a phenomenal priority irreducible to an associationist explana­
tion, Metzger claims that “the theory of empathy, according to which the Gestalt qualities of per­
ceptual things are ‘actually’ the feelings of the observer, which they somehow ‘transfer’ into those 
things, is not a continuation of the theory of the Gestalt quality of feelings, but the complete 
destruction of its actual meaning and a clear fall into atomistic modes of explanation” (Metzger, 
1941, 61, 70).
3 It is true that banks may look different, but I doubt that they can do without a style that is impres­
sive, intimidating, and a sign of power, or that a court of law could be based in the second floor flat 
of an anonymous building: their atmosphere of impressiveness and/or opulence can also be per­
ceived by those who simply observe it from outside.
4 The works of Tellenbach (1968), Böhme (2017a, 2017b), and, above all, Schmitz (1969, 2009, 
2014) were seminal for my atmospherology (although they never refer to affordances). Due to 
bibliography constraints I will just mention some of the affordance scholars consulted for this 
paper (Michael, Still, Ambrosini, Bloomfield, Latham, Vurdubakis, Bonderup Dohn, Borghi, 
Chow, Costantini, Estany, Martínez, Gillings, Ginsburg, Heft, Jones, Lu, Cheng, Normal, Prosser, 
Reybrouck, Stoffregen, Turner, Kaptelinin, Withagen, Young, Zipoli Caiani).

nature, albeit largely intersubjective, is inaccessible to an epistemic-analytical 
(micro- or macro-) perspective. Indeed, it precedes any analysis and influences the 
perceiver’s emotional situation from the outset, resisting (especially in prototypical 
cases) any conscious attempt at projective adaptation and epistemic correction.8 
Irreducible to occasional subjective vibrations, atmospheric feelings may within 
certain limits be traced back to a more or less homogeneous set of affordances 
understood as an atmosphere generator (Böhme) and thus be recognizable and lin­
guistically expressable. By using the power of their affordances, atmospheres tonal­
ize the affective space in which we (literally) enter and segment it through boundaries 
that are not geometrical but emotional.9 Whatever the phenomenology of the way 
we encounter atmospheres—they can capture us resisting any attempted projective 
transformation, can be noted but not shared, can go unnoticed or even be changed 
by someone with an opposite and more intense mood, can change or at least take on 
different nuances over time,10 etc.—they mostly occur as an in-between (between 
the perceiver and their environment).11 In prototypical cases, they may even be prior 
to the constitution of the two poles.
Even talking about atmospheres’ authority (Griffero, 2017a, 29–52) implies tak­
ing into account the role of affordances. An atmosphere, in fact, expresses more or 
less intensely what it affords a person to do and, above all (as we shall see), to feel. 
Needless to say, a theory of affordance-based atmospheres aims at enriching a long 
phenomenological tradition of emotional realism. According to this long-standing 
view, on the one hand, every lifewordly human relation to the world is primarily 
emotional-atmospheric (and not the detached-impoverished perception depicted by 
objective sciences), and on the other, the perceived-sensed world is by no means a 
meaningless sphere of dead properties (become an affective because of the more 
general continual ‘de-animation’12 of the world pursued by modern consciousness 
and physicalism) that the perceiver simply tinges with their private-idiosyncratic 
feelings, needs, and motives. Our felt-bodily interaction with the surrounding (lived) 
space is therefore always ruled by a physiognomic expressiveness13 to which we 
8 I.e., the effort with which a percipient who feels attacked by a dystonic atmosphere tries in vain 
to transform it by projecting (unconsciously) his own emotional desires and even (consciously) 
acting in such a way as to modify the encountered atmosphere.
9 They segment the space of our daily life by their being attractive or repulsive, relaxed or tense for 
example, thus also determining behavioral differences (but also differences in class, taste, cultural 
level, etc.).
10 Griffero (2014, 136–139; 2021, 54–58). I would simply reply to Arbib’s objection (Arbib, 2021, 
257) that any change still assumes the atmospheric first impression as a parameter. In a theatrical 
performance, the scenes may well change, but the leading atmosphere does not change radically 
from scene to scene (one ironic moment certainly does not turn the whole of Hamlet into a 
comedy).
11 I merely mention here the possibility that the atmosphere par excellence can be conceived of as 
a relationship preceding the relata, thus escaping the ever looming dualism.
12 Scheler (1923, 239).
13 Here I’m especially thinking of Merleau-Ponty’s criticism toward the paradigm of an acosmic 
thinking subject (1945, 307, 310, 372, 405, 523, and passim). Cf. also his theory—unfortunately

mostly respond as recommended by phenomena themselves. What matters most for 
this approach, though, is that this affective physiognomy, through which the world 
speaks to the normal percipient (not the experimental subject), can hardly be 
explained according to the hydraulic model of psychic filling of the extra-psychic 
world.14 Exactly as for affordance theory, for a neo-phenomenological atmospherol­
ogy, the abovementioned bank hall could not be belittling or prouding in the absence 
of perceivers. This, however, does not mean that the atmosphere’s (in this case) 
global affordance is the result of a simple projection from the inside to the outside, 
nor that it is completely different depending on the perceiver.
9.2  Fighting for a Different Culture
What led me to focus on similarities between affordances (ecological psychol­
ogy)—better, non-Gibsonian affordances15—and atmospheres (pathic aesthetics 
and phenomenology)16 is that both notions imply an embodied, non-­representational, 
and situated approach to perception. They also both take the co-development and 
co-evolution of perception and the lived space very seriously, thus rejecting a cul­
ture that dualistically splits the inner self and the outer world, limiting perception to 
a representationalist-cognitive and disembodied process. Despite their differences, 
both notions actually promote a post-cognitivist and anti-representationalist 
approach to experience by focusing on a lifewordly communication with the world. 
They pay due attention to the qualia of the lived (not geometric-isotropic) space and 
their (even unconsciously perceived) invitations to act but also consider feelings 
(which cannot be reduced to the simple dichotomy of attractive/unattractive). This 
idea of the embedded affordance perception of a situated perceiver, certainly antici­
pated in some Gestalt notions (demand character, invitation valence, etc.), also sug­
gests viewing this affective-perceptual meaningfulness as an affordance-based 
atmosphere. Moreover, since both affordances and atmospheres indicate that the 
perceiver cannot be separated from their environment-lived space, it is clear that in 
both cases the subjective/objective polarity loses its meaning. But if this is true for 
derivative atmospheres (which are much more frequent), it is not true for prototypi­
cal ones (see footnote 1). The latter allows for the dissonance between perceived 
outlined in pages that are still vague-metaphorical—of horizons of significance (ibid, 523), atmo­
spheric styles, and physiognomic characteristics.
14 According to which when a quality (moreover affective) appears to us in the external world, it 
would necessarily be projected (hydraulically) by the subject on that external world, as such 
wrongly considered, physicalistically, lacking in qualities (especially tertiary).
15 See Arbib (2021, §4.3).
16 In brief: by pathic I mean (Griffero, 2019a) an aesthesiological attitude based on the fact of 
abandoning oneself to lived experience instead of judging it, of being subject to something instead 
of being subject to something. This obviously means criticising the dominant western attitude of 
activity.

89
feeling and real involvement, and their peculiar emotional authority imposes itself 
upon the perceiver even, if not especially, when they try to reject the atmosphere 
from which they feel involved.
Furthermore, both affordance theory and atmospherology, against the standard 
constructivist approach and its mentalistic/dualistic concepts, advocate for the the­
sis of direct perception, meaning that the environment (our peri-corporeal lived 
space, in my lexicon) is laden with affective meaning that perceivers extract (which 
they resonate with, in my lexicon) during the course of their sensory experience. 
Direct perceptual realism means that perception does not need to postulate either 
inner processes (representations, inferences, computations, manipulation of repre­
sentations) or a mediated access to the world. Hence, my assumption is that an 
affordance-based atmosphere is a crucial part of our emotional life. Being directly 
detectable and not a mental-inferential construct, it tells us17 what to feel with and 
through it.
9.3  Novel Insights into Atmospheres
Needless to say that I do not consider the breadth of the concept affordance prob­
lematic. On the one hand, (i) it helps me specify some generative aspects of the 
atmospheric je ne sais quoi (often used as an alibi of ineffability), that is, to explain 
atmospheric expressiveness also as the outcome of affordances or ecstasies (but not 
properties). On the other hand, (ii) it is useful to better explain if and when an atmo­
sphere can be composed and thus even derive from possible interference of its com­
ponents. Both assumptions give more substance to the true but too-vague thesis that 
atmospheres express a holistic something more whose components, if any, allegedly 
escape analysis.
To develop (i) Gernot Böhme’s ontological notion of ecstasies of things may be 
very useful here. In this sense, atmospheric qualities are generated not by properties 
(accidents) of things (substances) but (among others) by their ecstasies: qualities 
that radiate “into the surroundings,” thus taking “away the homogeneity of the sur­
rounding space” and filling “it with tensions and movement suggestions.”18 Unlike 
properties, which exist even if they are only thinkable (the geometric ones for exam­
ple), atmospheres are nothing but phenomenal appearances whose affordances 
tonalize their surroundings, give a specific (expressive) voluminosity to any situa­
tion, modulate our lifeworld (even segmenting it qualitatively), and exist as purely 
“potential” ones only in a very inappropriate way.
To articulate (ii), in order to narrow the atmospheres’ holistic character, I claim 
that even an atmosphere resulting in a unitary and homogeneous affordance—the 
17 Without going so far as to claim—as later Merleau-Ponty did through too-metaphysical notions 
like chiasma and flesh designed to merge activity and passivity—that perceiving does not mean 
watching things but rather being watched by them, i.e., that seeing is always a response-gaze.
18 See especially Böhme (2017b, 37–54, 23 for the quotation).

90
typical one, which has the greatest probability of being sensed given the situational 
constraints—might result from the convergence between different micro-­
affordances, thus differing (emerging) from its components taken in isolation.19 
Furthermore, I stress that a subsequent and more in-depth perceptual experience, 
maybe through discovering the other feeling possibilities offered by the lived space, 
might reveal some discordance (even leading to an opposite feeling) between the 
first holistic atmosphere and the one suggested later by discrepant and initially 
unnoticed sub-atmospheres. As the environment is full of affordances, we could 
also assume, borrowing some terms from the debate on affordances as cascades of 
increasingly specific and occasional constraints,20 the existence of “cascades of 
atmospheres,” “sequential,” “nested,” or “complex” atmospheres—whence also the 
hypothesis of hierarchies of atmospheres, niches of atmospheric feelings (so to 
speak), even of different rank (prototypical, derived, spurious). Whenever this hap­
pens, whether by reversal of the starting figure/background or focus/context struc­
ture, or simply by a longer exposure that makes a certain atmosphere perceptible or 
imperceptible, one thing remains clear: the first-impression atmosphere can cer­
tainly be modified and even declined (not always reflectively), but it still acts as an 
invariant, as a paradigm of the subsequent emotional changes.21
9.4  Not Acting But Feeling Possibilities
If affordances are opportunities for action and behavior, you may wonder what 
actions and behaviors are suggested by what I call affordance-based atmospheres. 
Herein lies the main difference between the traditional affordance theory and my 
atmospherology: according to a pathic aesthetics, atmospheric affordances of the 
lived space denote feeling possibilities. Through a meaning that is neither semantic 
or representational nor limited to the optic array, they specify not so much possible 
actions (sitting upon a horizontal surface at an appropriate height for us, for exam­
ple), but rather what feelings they afford (feeling tense before going on stage, for 
example). Affordance-based atmospheres are ecological–emotional invitations 
19 An atmosphere as a whole may be the “supervening” result of micro-affordances not perceived 
as such, and even become an invariant in a certain culture (for this Böhme distinguisches between 
atmospheric and atmosphere).
20 “For example; socks afford the easier wearing of boots which afford the attachment of crampons 
which afford the climbing of snow-covered slopes which themselves become “affordable”, that is 
to say climbable” (Michael, 2000, 112).
21 To give even just an idea of the problematic nature of the subject: this claim to differentiation of 
the perceived atmosphere implies that there are thetical and non-thetical (background) affordance-­
based atmospheres, central and peripheral atmospheres, potential and actual atmospheres (the only 
ones that are such in the proper sense), atmospheres in competition with each other (for various 
reasons), atmospheres that fall below the perceptual threshold, etc.

91
ontologically rooted in things and quasi-things.22 They call upon us first of all to 
sense in a certain way (even contemplate) our peri-corporeal lived space, and only 
then to possibly think and act. Assigning the primacy not to action but to a pathic 
involvement means not to limit the affordance power to objects falling within per­
ceivers’ reaching space (as experimental psychologists often underline),23 consider­
ing perceivers no more as actors but as situational patheurs involved in something 
that happens to them unintentionally.
This perspective requires extending the meaning of both atmospheres and affor­
dances and going beyond the latter’s strictly pragmatic meaning, in line with the 
long-standing migration that this notion has already undergone. So unless the mean­
ing of “action” is extended to include every virtual affective motion (today called 
motor empathy, ideomotor simulation, etc.), it must be said that to an affordance-­
based atmosphere as a “value-affective rich ecological object” (modifying Gibson, 
1986, 140) one responds first of all in an emotional way (wonder, disgust, awe and 
fear in the sublime, and even emotional palsy). At times one also responds with a 
distancing or a contemplative (broadly aesthetic) detachment, which, however, is 
not to be confused with a Cartesian static-cognitive observation. The pathic nature 
of atmospheres, though, does not take away the fact that they are relatively inter-­
observable and repeatable, and above all that they function as the (ecological but 
also social) scaffolds of affective experiences that would not be possible without 
them, thus helping solidify hitherto only inchoative emotional experiences and even 
establishing a socionormative affective appropriateness.24
A certain landscape affords/invites us to contemplate it in a melancholic way, a 
church affords/invites us to experience it in humility or at least in a controlled and 
meditative way, a successful party affords/invites us to relax, a wooden or velvet 
material affords/invites to indulge in touching it, a tree standing erect and resisting 
the powerful sway of the wind affords/invites us to feel strength and obstinacy, an 
airy and well-designed architectural space affords/invites us to occupy it and freely 
walk around—in all these cases we sense a meaningfulness made up of demands-­
invitations that are inherent in our lived space and effective without being necessar­
ily true or adaptively functional, even if they are obviously related to the perceiver’s 
size (understood here in a felt-bodily and not physical sense).
Even a saying like “black is lugubrious even before being black,” often attributed 
to Wertheimer and obviously not transculturally valid, denotes for me not the prod­
uct of occasional subjective vibrations but a general and quasi-objective atmosphere 
precisely irradiated by the black as affordance-ecstasy (at least in certain cultures). 
22 This is a central notion in Schmitz, also denoting the ontological character of atmospheres (see 
Griffero, 2017a). For me, unlike full things, quasi-things are not endowed with borders, not sepa­
rated from other things, not lasting over time and not inactive if not touched, etc.
23 There are affordance-based atmospheres whose greatest affective resonance may require a static 
contemplation and even, if not above all – as Klages’ “eros of distance” assumes (Klages, 1922) – 
a(physical and psychic) distance that is in principle unbridgeable.
24 The lack of perception of the prevailing atmosphere, in fact, generates gaffes in those who do not 
perceive it and enables others to socially stigmatize them, etc.

As a quasi-objective affordance (or set of affordances), an atmosphere can even 
survive when no physical response is possible, as in the famous case of the phantom 
limb, where “the utilizable objects, precisely in so far as they present themselves as 
utilizable, appeal to a hand which I no longer have” (Merleau-Ponty, 1962, 95). This 
means that affordances atmospherically engage a perceiver even when the latter’s 
body is no longer able to fulfill them: thus, things cease to be “manipulatable for the 
perceiver” and become “manipulatable in itself”; in other words, it becomes an 
(atmospherical) affordance in itself.
9.5  No Need to Fear Ontology
The question of whether both atmosphere and affordance are a relational or non-­
relational concept—something generated by a relationship between the subject and 
the world or prior to such a relationship and conditions of possibility of it—is still a 
controversy.25 My first point is that atmospherology, especially when focusing on 
prototypical atmospheres and promoting an inflationary (non-metaphysical) onto­
logical inventory, can disregard the almost paranoid ecological fear for reification. 
Quasi-objective atmospheres are certainly entities and not only interactions, proper­
ties (let alone merely physical ones), or necessarily agent-related aspects. As not 
physical (proper) things but quasi-things, much like affordances—at least according 
to some theories—they are there even though they may not be actually perceived. A 
room’s tense atmosphere, for example, may not be noticed by those who enter it 
while feeling revved up, that is, without suitable circumstances, but it is still there 
as it pervades that particular lived space.
This atmospherological–ecological “rest-realism”26 shows no fear of reification, 
nor does it shy away from multiplying entities. This is primarily because it partially 
dereifies the very notion of entity by making it fluid, and secondly because it deval­
ues pragmatic questions like “for whom” and “when.” A bank hall’s atmosphere 
obviously does not afford a 2-year-old baby to feel awe or intimidation. However, 
this does not mean that its imposing vastness is not already potentially meaningful 
for the child, too, by triggering a certain felt-bodily resonance of dim disquiet. 
Consider, for example, the atmosphere of narrowness that is idiosyncratically privi­
leged by infants for its enveloping and protective character, while being felt as suf­
focating by adults because of the same felt-bodily resonance (emotional narrowness). 
Only this ontological-realist interpretation of atmospheres, after all, can account for 
the rich phenomenology of possible atmospheric encounters, including the dystonic 
perception of an atmosphere, the distinction between perceiving it and being really 
involved by it, the mood resistance to a manipulative atmosphere (think of 
25 For a recent approach to atmospheres and affordances that completely excludes their relationality 
in favor of a fully immersive holism prior to any relationship, see Begout (2020).
26 It is the basic degree of realism that is sufficient for the lifeworldly intersubjectivity (Griffero, 
2021, 67–83).

experiences that are transgressive or at least freely randomized with respect to what 
the disciplinary power wants), the reversed atmospheric feeling (the sadness sug­
gested by intolerable beauty, for example), etc.27
For both affordances and atmospheres, one may wonder if they are merely dispo­
sitional environmental qualities. A mutualist–dispositionalist perspective can only 
be maintained here cum grano salis. In fact, if from the empirical and first-person 
perspective atmospheres only are felt when they manifest themselves at a given time 
and in the right circumstances (when the feeling they afford is complete), from the 
ontological and third-person one they exist, at least for a reference class of potential 
perceivers, even though no one is feeling them at this moment or is not (yet) aware 
of them (which is what perhaps happens most often).28 This means that they are a 
feature of the environment even before manifesting themselves.
9.6  Felt-Bodily Resonance
Even though a lived space may trigger uncountable affordance-based atmospheric 
feelings, these are always only different filterings and resonances of the same atmo­
spheric first impression. Whether lit candles may trigger an atmosphere of romance 
in an intimate restaurant or an atmosphere of unease and fear in a dark cellar, these 
are just different atmospheric feelings (token) depending on an invariant atmosphere 
(type) produced by the reduction of brightness, the enveloping presence of shadows, 
the desubstantialization of objects, etc.
However, this partial variability suggests that, like affordances, ecological facts 
like atmospheres cannot be easily mapped out and analyzed. Nevertheless, they are 
always relative to dispositions of the perceiver’s lived body and not only, like prag­
matic affordances, to their physical body-scaling or at most their perceptual body 
schema: being invitations to feel something (without necessarily doing something), 
they are not bound to the potential of the physical body, as a certain pragmatic fun­
damentalism would demand. Since ecological psychology seems to be blind to the 
notion of felt body (Leib), it sometimes seeks help in neuroscience, without realiz­
ing that brains as such neither have proper experiences or capacities nor are felt 
corporeally.29 Therefore, if one wants to explain how to identify (not to measure!) 
atmospheric feelings phenomenologically, one would have much to gain from New 
Phenomenology’s theory of felt-bodily communication. This theory assumes that 
one immediately feels environmental bridge-qualities (motor suggestions and syn­
aesthetic characters) (Schmitz, 2011) and appropriately reproduces them in one’s 
27 For an (also literary) phenomenology of these atmospheric “games” see Griffero (2021, 29–66).
28 An analogy worthy of further investigation is Chemero’s distinction (2003), borrowed from 
Dennett, between properties like “lovely” (existing independently of an actual perceiver) and “sus­
picious” (meaningless in the absence of the percipient’s assessment).
29 I gladly leave to neurophysiologists a deep – but not phenomenological! – description of the 
structure and processes that allow the perceiver to feel affordance-based atmospheres.

lived body thanks to a felt-bodily alphabet that is based on an endless modification 
of the contraction–expansion relationship.30 Since I certainly cannot discuss this 
here, I would simply add that, being based on a first-person perspective, felt-bodily 
communication can neither fail to sense an atmosphere nor can sense an atmosphere 
that the lived space does not afford (put differently: from the first-person perspective 
no one is wrong in perceiving an atmosphere (where to find a criterion of adaequa­
tio in fact?), which is quite different from saying that they are wrong in explaining 
its cause and origin). In fact, whereas the perception of affordances can also be 
ecologically incorrect (misperception) or give life to false affordances, for atmosph­
erology even the mismatch between the atmospheric space that is largely agreed 
upon and its individual felt-bodily resonance cannot be properly considered a mis­
take, but only a different way of sensing the same atmosphere.31
9.7  Conclusion
Needless to say, the notion of affordance-based atmospheres can also be extremely 
useful in aesthetics: both in the broad sense of a philosophy of sensible knowledge 
(my pathic aesthetics) and in the strict sense of a philosophy of art. The effective­
ness of art, in fact, also results from the influence of atmospheric affordances-­
ecstasies hovering “around” the work of art but condensed in it in a meaningful way. 
Art can exemplarily manifest feelings as well as their atmospheric turmoil (real 
demonic and quasi-thingly powers), but always in a controlled and manageable 
form. Something similar can be said of design and especially architecture, under­
stood as a stage set producing sensuous atmospheres, a set of “gestures” ecstatically 
inviting the perceiver to feel and move in a certain way.32 Further analysis of the 
added value of an aesthetic atmospherology is beyond the scope of this paper, which 
simply aimed at sketching a few observations on the potential benefits of the 
decades-long debate on “affordances” for a theory of atmospheres. Of course, much 
remains to be done about this intriguing issue.
30 It includes notions like narrowness/vastness, contraction/expansion, direction, tension, dilation, 
intensity, rhythm, privative expansion/privative contraction, protopathic tendency/epicritic ten­
dency, felt-bodily isle formation/felt-bodily isle decrease, etc. See Schmitz (2011) and Griffero 
(2017b).
31 Nuremberg crowd can actually be “for them a thrilling atmosphere of national solidarity; for us, 
a chilling atmosphere of Nazi fanaticism” (Arbib, 2021, 258), but as a consequence of the same 
majestic, impressive, and immersive choreographic staging (simply filtered and politically 
addressed differently ex post).

Affordances for Spatial Navigation

10.1  Navigational Affordances
Navigation is a fundamental part of life for many animals including humans. It 
enables us to move successfully through an environment from one place to another. 
Through this process, one needs to be able to perceive a space, understand it, and 
make decisions on paths and directions to take, often rapidly. Affordances are what 
the environment offers an individual to be able to complete these actions; for spatial 
navigation, we consider the environmental affordances that help build internal mod­
els that represent the environment and support navigation through it (Gibson, 1977; 
Epstein et  al., 2015). Revisiting Gibson’s classic introduction to the concept of 
affordances, the physical environment and movement are used as central examples. 
It therefore comes as no surprise that aspects of our environment that provide affor­
dances—wall boundaries, landmarks, doorways, etc.—have been considered key 
examples of affordances that allow us to evaluate where we can and cannot go.
A vertical, flat, extended, and rigid surface such as a wall or a cliff face is a barrier to pedes­
trian locomotion. Slopes between vertical and horizontal afford walking, if easy, but only 
climbing, if steep, and in the latter case the surface cannot be flat … The affordance of a 
certain layout is perceived if the layout is perceived. (Gibson, 1979, p. 57)
As Heft (1988) outlines, under the lens of affordances we look toward what envi­
ronmental features objectively and psychologically offer an individual, rather than 
just what may be perceived. The theory of affordances is particularly useful for 
understanding spatial navigation as it highlights that components of the environ­
ment, which may otherwise be seen as circumstantial, are in fact key drivers of 
perception, action, and ultimately successful goal locating. Recent evidence

indicates that navigational affordances are processed in the very early stages of 
scene perception, within as early as 200 ms of viewing a scene (Harel et al., 2022). 
In this essay, we will briefly introduce some of the key environmental affordances 
that have been studied in spatial cognition, exploring how they help us navigate, and 
evidence for how the brain processes them. We will then consider future avenues of 
research and evaluate the importance of lesser-studied and more intangible environ­
mental affordances—such as affordances for affective responses (e.g. threat or 
relaxation) that are equally important for considering an environment for navigation.
10.2  Landmarks
Landmarks are one of the most widely discussed navigational affordances, acting as 
reference points that allow us to orientate ourselves in relation to the external world, 
to discern direction, and to decipher between otherwise similar spaces (Caduff & 
Timpf, 2008). A landmark is an element of an environment—physical or sensory—
that is used to mark specific locations to aid navigation (O’Malley et al., 2017). This 
could be a concrete object, e.g. Big Ben in London, UK, or a small lone rock in the 
arctic ice; or a geometric form, e.g. a junction or a plaza (Safari & Moridani, 2017). 
Landmarks can also be classified as either global or local landmarks—the former 
indicating those that are visible across long distances from many points of view; the 
latter indicating those that are only seen in close proximity to one’s current location 
(Noble et al., 2020). The way in which these two types of landmarks are used (and 
their effectiveness) has been debated with mixed results. Recent examination of this 
has come from the navigation test Sea Hero Quest, which captured data from over 
four million people navigating a virtual environment on mobile devices (Coutrot 
et al., 2018; Spiers et al., 2021). When the presence of local landmarks was com­
pared to the presence of local and global landmarks, global landmarks were not 
found to improve wayfinding significantly, suggesting that they are not powerful 
wayfinding aids (Yesiltepe et al., 2019a). However, the presence of global land­
marks and clear weather (as opposed to poor visibility fog) did correlate with 
improved wayfinding performance across different environments (Yesiltepe et al., 
2019b). To better understand these nuanced differences, the specific roles and val­
ues of different landmarks and their spatial integration need further exploration.
Saliency is also considered important to the role of landmarks in aiding naviga­
tion; it has been suggested that the more visually unique the landmark, the more 
salient it is and therefore better remembered (Miller & Carlson, 2011). In cases 
where navigational abilities are compromised, such as Alzheimer’s dementia (Tu 
et al., 2017), salient landmarks are particularly important; contrast colours, artwork, 
and lighting can all be used to boost saliency and improve wayfinding (Utton, 2009). 
However, landmark saliency is not always necessarily intrinsic to the item itself. 
Rather, it can be determined through the balance of three factors: (1) cognitive 
salience (the observer’s conceptual point of view, knowledge, and preconceptions), 
(2) perceptual salience (the feature in question’s ability to attract attention), and (3) 
L. Gregorians and H. J. Spiers

101
contextual salience (the circumstance and purpose of the journey) (Caduff & Timpf, 
2008). Recent work has highlighted that some features that lack perceptual salience 
(determined from image processing) can take on important cognitive salience for 
navigation in virtual environments (Yesiltepe et al., 2021). For example, some small 
rocks may be a feature that marks an important turn, but are missed by standard 
image processing analyses to predict saliency (Yesiltepe et al., 2021).
The identification and spatial encoding of landmarks are supported by a circuit 
of brain regions including the functionally labelled occipital place area (OPA; a 
region of the visual cortex tied to visuospatial perception and path identification), 
parahippocampal place area (PPA; tied to encoding scene geometry and layout), and 
retrosplenial complex (RSC; linked to spatial-memory and broader environmental 
integration) (Janzen & Van Turennout, 2004; Marchette et al., 2015; Epstein et al., 
2017). These three regions are central to scene processing in particular and show 
greater response to viewing scenes than to object stimuli (Bonner & Epstein, 2017). 
It is worth noting that the functional region RSC overlaps with the anatomical region 
in humans described as the retrosplenial cortex, but the RSC also tends to include 
broader medial posterior parietal regions (Epstein et al., 2017). When learning a 
route via a focus on landmarks, activity in RSC has been found to encode spatial and 
temporal relations between neighbouring landmarks (Wolbers et  al., 2004). The 
RSC also appears to operate alongside the PPA when passively viewing scenes; the 
PPA is thought to encode the fixed features that form scenes in order to create a 
representation of the layout, and the RSC situates this scene within the wider envi­
ronment to aid navigation to goals (Epstein, 2008). Similarly, the parahippocampal 
gyrus is able to distinguish navigationally relevant landmarks (those at decision 
points) from landmarks at navigationally irrelevant locations and store this spatial 
information regardless of memory or focus on the given objects (Janzen & Van 
Turennout, 2004).
10.3  Detecting Navigable Paths and Boundaries
Understanding the environment around us involves perceiving a given space, its 
configuration, and our location within it. The work of Bonner and Epstein (2017, 
2018) has contributed significantly to our understanding of how navigationally rel­
evant affordances (i.e. information about where you can and cannot go) are pro­
cessed. To explore this, virtual rooms were generated with three walls and up to 
three exit options. Layouts that offered similar exit paths showed similar activation 
patterns in the OPA, whilst those with different route options had dissimilar activa­
tion patterns (Bonner & Epstein, 2017). This encoding occurred regardless of other 
visual noise or distraction in the scene, or whether a person was actively focusing 
on the act of navigating or not, demonstrating that navigational affordances are 
automatically extracted from visual information, and that visual similarities (e.g. 
geometry of space) are not driving the effects seen in the OPA. The OPA appears to 
be coding specifically navigational information during the early stages of scene 
10  Affordances for Spatial Navigation

102
processing, as fast as 200 ms from viewing a scene (Harel et al., 2022). Bonner and 
Epstein (2018) have gone on to further unpick the computations that lead to the 
OPA’s mapping of possible paths, using convolutional neural networks to show that 
affordance information and extraction can be predicted through feedforward com­
putations. Boundary-defining junctions—i.e. where surfaces such as walls or floors 
meet—and large, extended surfaces were found to be highly important features in 
these computations. Whether the PPA and RSC are also able to specifically distin­
guish navigational rather than purely spatial affordances is still unclear.
Djebbara et al. (2019, 2021) have also studied the impact of affordances that 
indicate where you can and cannot go, deducing that this type of affordance pro­
cessing is embedded in early perceptual processing. Using mobile immersive virtual 
reality, participants viewed a single doorway of varying width that led onto another 
space and consequently were informed whether to pass through or not. On viewing 
these environments, the parahippocampal region and occipital area covaried with 
the given  “passability”. When moving toward the doorway, the supplementary 
motor area (tied to the control of movement) and posterior cingulate cortex (poten­
tially balancing internal vs. external attention) varied with the change in action. 
Their results suggest that “sensorimotor dynamics reflect behaviour-relevant fea­
tures in the designed environment” (Djebbara et al., 2021)—that perception of sen­
sory cues, cognition, and action unfold in parallel and are innately tied to (the 
potential opportunities for) movement as dictated by body and environment. Within 
this, the landscape of affordances is in itself dynamic; movement leads to changes 
in environmental affordances, and how these are chosen or capitalised on may be 
influenced by estimations of what future affordances these choices could create, and 
how they relate to a larger goal (Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016).
Boundaries can also be pivotal, both in affording a measure of containment, but 
also playing a role in spatial memory, by “anchoring”1 objects to a space (Zisch 
et al., 2022). Locations of objects can be learnt relative to surface geometries, acti­
vating the right posterior hippocampus, or learnt relative to landmarks, activating 
the right dorsal striatum (Doeller & Burgess, 2008). Akin to processing navigational 
affordances, the OPA appears to play an important role in processing boundaries 
(Julian et al., 2016). This is consistent with the OPA processing information in the 
visual scene about where one can or cannot move, such as boundaries defining a 
region for movement or paths allowing for future travel. Notably, boundaries can 
also be more abstract, being derived from an understanding of the segregation of 
different regions within a city (Griesbauer et al., 2021).
10.4  Line of Sight
Spatial configurations determine what is visible within a person’s line of sight—
another spatial characteristic that has been shown to be an important affordance for 
spatial behaviour. In any environment with enclosure, the line of sight to other loca­
tions will vary from each location and viewpoint. In terms of choosing route options, 
L. Gregorians and H. J. Spiers

research suggests that people prefer to follow paths along the straightest line of 
sight (Dalton, 2003). When presented with binary options of two paths to search for 
a target location, the option with the longest line of sight will tend to be chosen and 
people will spend more time looking at the option with the longer line of sight 
(Wiener et al., 2009). This makes logical sense in that the region with the longer line 
of sight is likely to contain more locations for targets to be located in. Longer lines 
of sight in cities often relate to major routes, as those with small lines of sight may 
be dead ends or contain less shops or buildings people might visit (Hillier, 1996). 
Visual integration has also been linked to improved wayfinding performance 
(Yesiltepe et al., 2019b).
10.5  Spatial Configurations
Understanding a singular space naturally extends to the need to understand a string 
of spaces. The positioning of related spaces impacts what path options are available 
and what regions of open space can be traversed. Spatial configuration, as defined 
by Hillier (1996), considers how the relationship between two spaces alters through 
their connection to a third space. The field of Space Syntax proposes techniques for 
analysing spatial configurations and relates this to human behaviour (Hillier & 
Hanson, 1989; Hillier, 1996). For example, a street network can be deposed into a 
graph in which the streets are nodes in the network. Using graph-theoretic measures 
of centrality, it is possible to quantify how strongly connected different streets are in 
the network (Fig. 10.1).
Highly integrated streets (high closeness centrality) will tend to have more ame­
nities and be nearer the centre of the environment, e.g. Oxford Street in London, UK 
(Hillier, 1996, Fig. 10.1d). Space Syntax approaches can explore street networks 
both across the global network or with a different radius to give measures of local 
integration and global integration (Fig. 10.1e–g). When participants were asked to 
choose a direction of travel at a decision point from Google Street View images, 
they tended to choose the more connected street (deducing centrality from their cur­
rent position) (Emo, 2014). Eye-tracking data indicates they do so by focusing 
attention on the spatial geometry of the environment (Emo, 2014, Fig. 10.2). Well-­
connected spaces afford intelligibility, acting as visual cues that ascertain what is 
beyond the visual field, connecting local properties to the larger spatial structure 
(Hillier, 1996). Better intelligibility has been linked to better wayfinding perfor­
mance (Yesiltepe et al., 2019b). Affordances in which paths can be taken (e.g., one-­
way streets) have also been shown to impact navigation and representations of 
distance in virtual towns (Brunec et al., 2017).
Repeated exposure to certain affordances of spatial configurations during child­
hood may also impact navigational ability and route choice. Cities vary in how 
organised their streets are. Cities like Chicago (USA) are formed with a strongly 
rectilinear grid arrangement, whilst others like Rome (Italy) are much more miss-­
aligned with a nearly random arrangement. Testing over 390,000 people with Sea

Hero Quest, we have found that growing up in countries with grid-like cities (e.g. 
USA) results in poorer navigation skills in environments that are more randomly 
arranged; the more random, the worse the navigation (Coutrot et al., 2020). In more 
grid-like environments, there is even a slight benefit from growing up in griddy cit­
ies. This may result from the fact that during development, the brain acquires 
repeated experiences of navigating with near 90 degree turns to reach destinations 
in griddy cities, or more diverse angles between paths in more organic cities or rural 
settings. This then may mean the navigator is more prone to make different assump­
tions about what will occur during navigation and make errors if the affordances in 
the environment (e.g. disorganised streets) do not match stored expectations. A 
similar impact of expectations in affordances can be seen in the navigation of mul­
tistory buildings, where floors in a building that differ in layout cause disorientation 
due to a mismatch in expectations (Hölscher et al., 2012). On the flip side, optimis­
ing for expectations in linear spatial configurations coupled with saliency between 
spaces may lead to better spatial learning and navigation (Zisch et al., 2014).
To examine how brain regions process information about the topology of street 
networks, Javadi et al. (2017) recorded fMRI data while participants navigated a 
film simulation of Soho in London, UK (Fig. 10.3). When entering a new street dur­
ing navigation tasks, the right posterior hippocampal activity was found to increase 
when a new street had more connections (higher degree centrality/connectivity) and 
decrease when these went down, e.g. entering a dead-end. Activity in the right ante­
rior hippocampus reflected changes in the new streets’ closeness centrality/integra­
tion. However, in Soho, integration was confounded with a line of sight (more 
integrated streets were longer), so it remains unclear whether this response was 
specific to integration or to a longer view. Overall, the posterior hippocampus 
appears to process local information about street networks, and the anterior hippo­
campus may process the more global aspects of an environment.

used for statistical inference (which was carried out within the statistical parametric mapping 
framework), but is shown to illustrate the analytic approach. (b, c) Right posterior hippocampal

Recent recordings from the homologue of the posterior hippocampus in rats 
(dorsal CA1) have revealed further insights into how the hippocampus may process 
connected environments. In rats, it is possible to record the extracellular activity of 
neurons as rats explore and navigate. In the hippocampus, a large number of neu­
rons show spatially localised firing, with cells firing in different regions of space, 
each active when the rat runs through the neuron’s particular part of the environ­
ment it is active for. These neurons are known as “place cells” and are thought to 
form an internal map of space (O’Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971). Changes in the con­
nections between regions of space (e.g. blocking a path or a door) appear to have 
little impact on the map of the regions formed by the localised activity of place cells 
(Duvelle et al., 2021; Widloski & Foster, 2022). However, when resting between 
journeys, a sequence of place cells that represent locations away from the current 
location can become active, and these follow the new connections in the space 
(Widloski & Foster, 2022). Thus, the hippocampus appears to represent the possible 
paths through a space when rats are resting between runs; for humans, something 
similar may occur when we finish travelling down one street and enter into a new 
one (Javadi et al., 2017, Fig. 10.3). This replay (the process of mentally re-running 
the series of cell activations that would have occurred on a journey) may help update 
knowledge stored in the striatum about what the optimal actions to take are given 
the new connections within the environment, e.g. to avoid some streets that used to 
be helpful (Gahnstrom & Spiers, 2020). This may also help update knowledge in the 
prefrontal regions about possible alternative options (Patai & Spiers, 2021). Other 
evidence indicates that after seeing (but not traversing) a path to a rewarding but 
unattainable goal, the hippocampus will preplay this future, as yet untaken, path to 
reward during sleep (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2015).
10.6  Affective Affordances of Space
An environment with helpful landmarks, clear boundaries, and an intelligible layout 
will be easier to navigate than those that lack these features. However, it is not just 
visual and geometric affordances that make an environment easy or hard to navi­
gate; affordances that impact affect also play a role. For example, features that allow 
for safety, comfort, calm, or excitement may make an environment easier to traverse 
or remember (Zisch et al., 2014), whereas an environment that is threatening, dis­
gusting, or extremely noisy may be more of a challenge. Such affordances can come 
from the geometry or layout of the environment. Enclosed spaces, for example, are 
more likely to be avoided than open spaces (Vartanian et al., 2015). But affective 
affordances can also come unsurprisingly from other features present in the envi­
ronment. Broader built-environment research has provided a variety of evidence to 
demonstrate how aesthetic aspects of our environments—including biophilia, 
colour, texture, lighting, geometry, neighbourhood wealth indicators (broken build­
ings), etc.—contribute to how people feel within or react to spaces (e.g. Vartanian 
et al., 2015, 2021; Hackman et al., 2019). A wide variety of factors can also impact 
10  Affordances for Spatial Navigation

good navigational decision-making; the environment can afford the navigator a 
calm space to think, or cause the navigator to become angry or anxious, such as 
when dealing with difficult traffic driving across a busy city (Spiers & Maguire, 2008).
Animal cognition studies have tended to implicitly assume that affect or feeling 
is not relevant to spatial mapping, but there is some indication that affective 
responses induced by environments could impact navigation. Lighting, route 
choices, and novel environments can all provoke physiological stress responses in 
rodents (Bailey et  al., 2006; cited in Sternberg & Wilson, 2006). Similarly, in 
humans, one might feel a sense of spatial unease if disoriented; a lack of landmarks 
may be stress-inducing; and many feelings are spatial-specific, e.g. agoraphobia 
(Jeffery, 2019; Sternberg & Wilson, 2006). In Zisch et al. (2014), the authors sum­
marise how the brain creates representations of environments by walking the reader 
through the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, noting how hippocampal cells might 
respond to this specific architectural space. The affective dimension of these map­
pings is considered, from the pleasure that might be experienced in successfully 
constructing internal maps and memories of space, to the delight of surprise that 
might be experienced on revisiting this (now familiar) space and discovering novel 
changes (i.e. remapping of place cell maps). Their concluding challenge, however, 
remains: understanding how feelings, which are afforded by the environment, inter­
act with spatial representations and navigational strategies.
There has been some experimental work looking at questions in this intersection 
of human navigation and affective responses to built spaces. Kostakos et al. (2020) 
explored the affordance of lighting in the process of wayfinding, with results sug­
gesting that though directive lighting (i.e. lighting that guides a route) does not 
improve wayfinding performance, it does reduce participant heart rates—perhaps 
an indication of improving cognitive processing, or an affective response to the 
aesthetic experience. Vartanian et al. (2015) demonstrate that rooms with higher 
ceilings are more likely to be deemed beautiful, but also activate structures for 
visuospatial exploration. Moreover, Erkan’s (2018) results suggest that high ceil­
ings can improve wayfinding performance and memory of space. These studies 
highlight connections between elements of our environments, affective responses, 
and consequent decisions about how we move.
10.7  Conclusions
There have been significant advances in recent years in understanding how environ­
mental affordances enable humans and animals to make sense of an environment 
and navigate through it. Affordances such as landmarks, paths, and boundaries 
demarcate the potential for movement through a space or between spaces to a goal. 
The OPA, PPA, RSC, and hippocampus are all central to how these affordances are 
processed and translated into navigational opportunities, with scene processing 
occurring in the first 200 ms of perceptual processing. Behaviourally, Space Syntax 
has also offered tools to demonstrate the influence of spatial configurations and the

importance of centrality, integration, and intelligibility to how choices are made in 
navigation.
However, what is less considered in navigation is how these very same environ­
mental affordances, and the environment at large, can induce affective responses. 
Affordances can dictate where you can and cannot go, but can also be alluring or 
repellent—these affective responses, through aesthetic processing, therefore can 
drive behaviours, physically and metaphorically drawing us in or away (Yazdani 
et al., 2012). How an inhabitant feels when entering a space—whether confident or 
unsettled, happy or scared—may factor into navigational choices and abilities. As 
such, their integration into spatial navigation becomes an obvious focus for future 
research.
Moving forward and learning from findings in neighbouring research fields, it 
will be important to understand what affordances, beyond the visual or “measur­
able”, and certainly beyond the objective, are influencing navigation. Looking at 
how environmental affordances impact personal, affective experiences of space may 
allow us to better understand the relationship between the spaces we traverse, how 
we feel within them, and how we make sense of them.

Concepts
Anna M. Borghi
11.1  Introduction
11.1.1  Affordances: From Gibson to Embodied 
and Grounded Cognition
Affordances, said Gibson (1977), consist of the invitations that the world offers to 
us. Affordances of objects prompt our actions. In recent years, the notion of affor­
dance has been re-evaluated because of its potential to highlight the relationship 
between perception and action. According to Gibson, affordances are neither sub­
jective nor objective; they concern both the subjects and the environment, and they 
involve both perception and action. Thinking of perception and action not as sequen­
tial processes but as strictly interrelated and mutually dependent represented a fun­
damental step for theories, like grounded and embodied ones, that emphasize the 
importance of action for cognition. While the interrelation between perception and 
action of the Gibsonian notion of affordance has caused its later success, scholars 
adopting embodied and grounded views diverged from Gibson’s externalist per­
spective, according to which affordances were simply a matter of the relationship 
between objects and organisms, with scarce attention to what happened “inside the 
observers head.” They deemed the neural representation of affordances is relevant 
and proposed that affordances consisted of visuomotor associations in the brain 
(Ellis & Tucker, 2000).

11.1.2  Object Affordances and the Physical and Social Context
This important shift in the study of affordances has been complemented more 
recently by another paramount change. Until some years ago, literature on affor­
dances mainly focused on responses to single objects. Recent studies have empha­
sized that affordances are influenced by the physical and social context. Particularly 
relevant for this paper are studies showing that the social context and the social 
norms strongly influence affordances activations. For example, when we know that 
an object is owned by somebody else, we do not activate its affordances (Constable 
et al., 2011). Within a given context, a competition between multiple affordances 
might occur (Cisek, 2007; Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016). In recent work in our lab, we 
have shown that object affordances are highly variable depending on the context 
(e.g., Michalland et al., 2021—in-principle acceptance.) but also on the characteris­
tics and intentions of the agents (e.g., Scorolli et al., 2014) and that children respond 
to objects more creatively compared to adults, who tend to repeat more stereotypical 
actions and to be more functionally fixed to specific actions (Rio, Lugli, Benassi, 
Nicoletti, Borghi, 2019, in preparation; review in Mazzuca et al., 2021). One of the 
challenges of future research on affordances is, in my view, to understand in which 
cases affordances are automatically evoked and whether and to what extent the con­
text filters the activation of affordances (see Borghi, 2018, for an extensive analysis 
of this issue). So far, I have dealt with object affordances. Importantly, while most 
studies focused on motor affordances evoked by objects, in recent years some new 
proposals emerged that have extended the notion of affordances to sociocultural 
practices (Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). The notion of affordances as linked to 
sociocultural practices is very relevant to addressing the interaction between affor­
dances, categorization, and language, and particularly that between affordances and 
abstract concepts, on which the next chapter will focus.
11.2  Affordances, Categorization, and Language
Many studies have investigated how object affordances are activated during the 
comprehension and use of language. Research on language and affordances has 
highlighted two important aspects. First, the fact that participants are sensitive to 
object affordances during language processing confirms that language is grounded 
in perception and action systems; nouns evoke a simulation of their referents, and 
verbs a simulation of possible actions. Second, evidence indicates that language 
constrains the activation of affordances. It activates stable rather than variable affor­
dances (Borghi & Riggio, 2015)—for instance, language encodes, and we activate 
the size of objects and the subsequent grip to use when comprehending or using a 
word like “banana” or “cup.” However, we do not activate the orientation of the 
handles of the cup because it is mutable and changing. The authors showed that 
when participants read a sentence like “grasp the brush,” but not when we read the 
sentence “look at the brush,” they represent the grip (power vs. precision) the object 
A. M. Borghi

115
requires, as well as the canonical orientation a brush might have (Borghi & Riggio, 
2009). In a similar vein, Costantini et al. (2011) showed that, when prompted by 
noun–verb combinations like “grasp” and “bottle” and “pour” and “bottle,” but not 
“observe” and “bottle,” participants are sensitive to the fact that the mentioned 
objects, e.g., the bottle, is close to us or not, thus can evoke affordances related to 
the actions of grasping and pouring. These examples show in a quite straightforward 
way that affordances might be activated because the words refer to objects which 
are clearly bounded and have a specific size, orientation, and location in space. And 
yet, even here, it might be debated whether we need to simulate the action fully dur­
ing simple linguistic exchanges. More problems arise when we have to comprehend 
and use words, the referents of which are more detached from sensory modalities, 
i.e., do not directly evoke affordances. It is the case, for instance, of words express­
ing abstract concepts, like “truth” and “freedom.” Do these concepts evoke affor­
dances? Can research on affordances be important also to understand abstract 
concepts and words?
11.2.1  Concrete and Abstract Concepts and Affordances
Abstract concepts, like truth, are very complex and sophisticated, and mastery in 
their use has been deemed as the hallmark of human cognition (Borghi et al., 2017). 
Compared to concrete concepts like “chair,” abstract concepts like truth typically 
activate less sensorimotor and more emotional and interoceptive properties and 
elicit more linguistic experiences; they collect very heterogeneous exemplars and 
are acquired later and through the linguistic modality rather than through percep­
tion. We do not contend neither that concrete and abstract concepts are dichoto­
mously opposed, nor that there is a continuum going from very abstract to very 
concrete concepts. Rather, abstract concepts come in a great variety, from philo­
sophical–religious concepts to numerical concepts, from emotional concepts to 
social ones (Villani et al., 2019). Hence, they can be represented as points in a 
multidimensional space defined by dimensions such as abstractness/concreteness, 
imageability, emotionality, linguistic Mode of Acquisition, etc. Apparently, abstract 
concepts do not have any specific relations with affordances. Instead, I think studies 
on affordances might represent one of the bases contributing to a full understanding 
of how abstract concepts are acquired, represented, and used. Here I will propose 
two claims. First, I will show that affordances might play a role in the emergence of 
abstract concepts. I will contend that to acquire the ability to develop and use 
abstract concepts, we first need to learn to respond to affordances and form 
affordance-­based categories and then progressively abstract from them. Second, I 
will analyze social affordances that might influence the use of abstract concepts. 
Specifically, I will contend that, when we comprehend and use abstract concepts, 
the affordances to which we respond might be represented by other people. I will 
address these two issues in the following.
11  Merging Affordances and (Abstract) Concepts

116
11.2.2  From Affordances-Based to Goal-Derived 
to Abstract Concepts
The ability to form and use abstract concepts relies on that to form affordances-­
based concepts. Consider a child interacting with the surrounding world (Fig. 11.1). 
First, she will form concepts based on common perceptual elements or common 
motor affordances. For example, she will form the category of cups, and that of 
chairs. The exemplars of the category of cups and chairs are similar to each other—
their members have similar perceptual elements, and they afford similar actions, 
like drinking and sitting. This similarity among the category members doesn’t con­
cern only artifacts but also holds for natural kinds—e.g., exemplars of geranium are 
similar in shape and color, and afford to plant, to water, to avoid stepping on them. 
Once children are able to form categories whose members are quite similar to each 
other, they learn to form categories the members of which are not necessarily simi­
lar. Note that there is not necessarily a sequentiality between the two processes, but 
the second is certainly more complex and likely occurs later; furthermore, to accom­
plish it, the help of others is more crucial. An example is the so-called ad hoc and 
goal-derived categories studied by Larry Barsalou (e.g., Barsalou, 1983) in the 
1980s. Goal-derived categories collect examples that are perceptually dissimilar, 
but share common goals, like “things to take on the camping place.” Being able to 
form such categories implies being able to flexibly put together elements based on 
the context, disrupting similarities based on the correlational structure of the envi­
ronment. Importantly, for these categories, the role of sociocultural practices 
becomes more crucial—their members are put together not because they have 
Fig. 11.1  Concrete concepts generally collect similar exemplars with common affordances; ad 
hoc and goal-derived concepts keep together perceptually dissimilar exemplars with different 
object affordances but based on common sociocultural practices; abstract concepts collect dissimi­
lar exemplars the affordances of which might be based on common sociocultural practices
A. M. Borghi

117
common perceptual elements and evoke common affordances, but due to the goals 
that reflect practices existent in a given culture. Which role do affordances play in 
the forming and consolidation of these categories? Certainly, motor-based affor­
dances do not play a primary role. Consider a category like “birthday presents,” 
which in Western cultures might include exemplars as heterogeneous as records, 
pets, plants, books, and bicycles. The exemplars of this category do not have much 
in common and activate motor affordances that are quite different—for instance, 
pets afford caressing, plants afford to water, and bicycles afford to ride. Yet, the 
members of this category share affordances related to the same sociocultural prac­
tice—for example, objects and entities that are “birthday presents” are typically 
made or chosen carefully, thinking of a person, and they are donated to this person 
in a generally jolly situation. Motor affordances are typically evoked by single 
objects or entities, whereas affordances related to sociocultural practices allow gen­
eralization. Notably, language might play a critical role in going beyond motor 
affordances, helping us put together categories that assemble heterogeneous exem­
plars through a common label.
Consider now typical abstract concepts, like truth or freedom. Similar to goal-­
derived categories, their exemplars are quite heterogeneous and not perceptually 
similar. In our view, the ability to form and use abstract concepts implies great flex­
ibility and relies on the capability to build categories whose members are not per­
ceptually similar and that are low dimensional, i.e., the members of which do not 
have many common elements. Importantly, by forming novel abstract concepts, we 
act on the environment and transform it. We do not adopt a bottom-up process, 
which involves simply responding to environmental stimuli. Rather, we actively 
arrange in novel ways the stimuli we are exposed to, based on a criterion that is 
defined top-down. This process is often performed together with other people; it is 
a collective process. What is the role of affordances here? Motor affordances do not 
play a role—they might be evoked by the single exemplars of a category but are not 
related by the category as a whole. Yet, affordances, as derived by sociocultural 
practices developed within a given cultural milieu, might play a role in forming 
these categories. For example, in many of our societies, the concept of freedom 
might remind us of the practice of exiting prison. Note that the claim I made is quite 
general and might apply to abstract concepts as a whole—abstract concepts might 
be formed based on affordances related to sociocultural practices. However, this 
claim might be more compelling for some subkinds of abstract concepts. For 
instance, the role of sociocultural practices might be more influential for the repre­
sentation of philosophical–religious concepts than for the representation of emo­
tional concepts, while motor affordances might be more relevant for abstract 
concepts related to numbers (small numbers, until 10) and spatial concepts. Future 
research should investigate in-depth the relationship between subkinds of abstract 
concepts and different kinds of affordances.

11.2.3  Abstract Concepts and Social Affordances
As anticipated, we can refer to object affordances but also consider affordances in a 
broader sense, not limiting the application of this notion to motor affordances 
related to specific effectors. Other people might offer us affordances—in recent 
years, these affordances have been named social affordances (see Fig. 11.2). For 
example, Gentilucci and colleagues (e.g., Ferri et al., 2011) have shown that other 
people may yield social affordances, e.g., opening their mouths to invite us to feed 
them. Here I contend that, when we process and use abstract concepts, we actively 
search for the help of other people, which represent for us a kind of social affor­
dance. Consider what happens when we read or listen to an abstract concept 
expressed by an abstract word. As argued elsewhere (Borghi, 2020; Borghi et al., 
2021), we might experience more uncertainties in grasping the meaning of abstract 
than of concrete words: for example, we might be unsure of the correct meaning of 
the word “democracy.” Even in the cases in which we feel we know the word mean­
ing, we might be unsure whether and to what extent the meaning we know is shared 
with others. For example, a scientist might think that she has a clear definition of the 
notion of “representation,” but might be unsure of the close correspondence between 
Fig. 11.2  Social affordances. In the study of Ferri et al. (2011), open mouth invites the feeding 
action. In the study by Fini et al. (2020), having to guess words, the abstract ones, for which the 
experimenter’s suggestions are crucial, lead participants to be more synchronous with the avatar 
embodying her
A. M. Borghi

119
the meaning she intends with that used by other scientists. With abstract concepts 
like “democracy” and “representation,” we might therefore need to rely on others 
more than with similarity-based concepts, either to ask them the meaning or to 
negotiate it with them. We have called this process social metacognition (Borghi 
et al., 2019), to emphasize the fact that it involves a meta-cognitive process of self-­
evaluation of our own knowledge (Shea, 2018), and that, if the outcome of the pro­
cess is a negative evaluation, it involves reverting to others. In this situation in which 
we need help, others can scaffold us; they represent anchors that help us clarify or 
redefine more clearly and compellingly the conceptual meaning. We have argued 
elsewhere that because we feel we need others more, we might tend to be more col­
laborative with them (Borghi et al., 2021). The presence of other people can thus 
offer affordances from which we benefit. There is, however, a difference between 
the notion of social affordance investigated, for example, by Ferri et al. (2011), and 
the one we refer to when speaking about abstract concepts. In the study by Ferri 
et al. (2011), participants respond to a movement of others—the opening of the 
mouth—that invites action from their side. In the case of abstract concepts, instead, 
people actively search for others to rely on their competencies, and this influences 
their motor behavior toward others. The authors (Fini et al., 2020) have recently 
shown how this process might occur. Participants had to guess which abstract or 
concrete concepts some images referred; a different experimenter showed them the 
concrete and abstract concepts. When they were not able to guess, they could ask 
the experimenter for help. They were told that, after the guessing phase, a joint 
action phase with an avatar embodying the experimenter would follow and that then 
another guessing phase would follow. Participants tended to move toward the object 
more synchronously with the avatar, which embodied the experimenter who had 
helped them guess abstract than concrete concepts. Consistently, they had the feel­
ing that they needed them more for the guessing task, and that abstract concepts 
were perceived as more difficult to guess without others’ help. In this case other 
people can be conceived as offering social affordances.
11.3  Conclusion
The notion of affordance posits important challenges for the investigation of lan­
guage and abstract concepts. On the one hand, it shows that language is grounded in 
the sensorimotor system, while on the other, it indicates that language operates at an 
abstract level, filtering and selecting information derived from affordances—for 
example, language encodes stable but not variable affordances. In this chapter, I 
have outlined two different ways in which literature on affordances can be relevant 
for the study of concepts. First, affordances might play a role in the emergence of 
abstract concepts. When we form concrete concepts, we typically collect perceptu­
ally similar elements, which have common motor affordances. When we form 
abstract concepts, instead, we must learn to avoid focusing on motor affordances 
elicited by single objects. We have to flexibly put together categorical exemplars

based on affordances that rely on common sociocultural practices. Second, other 
people’s presence and scaffolding role might be particularly crucial for the acquisi­
tion and use of abstract concepts. Hence, other people might be sources eliciting 
social affordances. The extent to which these two processes are modulated by dif­
ferent kinds of affordances (motor affordances and affordances linked by sociocul­
tural practices) and by different kinds of abstract concepts remains an open issue for 
further research.

Everyone seems to know what space is. But the meaning of “space” varies from 
person to person and from one occasion to another. It varies among the academic 
disciplines concerned with spatiality, such as physics, psychology, and phenome­
nology, and among practical professions, such as architecture and filmmaking, stage 
design and creative writing. How can we reconcile this polyphony? Is there an 
underlying root concept of space? In other words, do these multiple and disparate 
concepts have a “focal meaning”? One manner of answering these questions is 
offered here, by considering a moving person who is sequentially exposed to spe­
cific possibilities of experience at different spatial locations. Reminiscent of the 
concept of affordance, the present account is concerned with possibilities of experi­
ence, rather than with actual experience, and it is trained on distributed patterns of 
perception and behavior, rather than on their piecewise characterization.
The term ‘space perception’ is unfortunate because it suggests that space is something that 
we perceive. Only objects are perceived, and these objects possess a number of attributes—
qualitative, intensive, and spatial. The term refers to the perception of the spatial attributes 
of objects, viz., their size, shape, stability, motility, and their distance and directional loca­
tions in reference to each other and to the perceiving subject. […] Space as distinct from 
these spatial attributes is a conceptual construct. (Harvey A. Carr, 1935)

12.1  The Focal Meaning of Concepts of Space
It is striking how often concepts of space are introduced in terms of what space is 
not rather than what it is. Our epigraph is an example of this negative (apophatic) 
tradition.1 One reason for this peculiar situation may be that void is a common con­
notation of space. It is natural to describe void in terms of absence.
Another reason may be that there exist numerous concepts of space, developed 
by the various disciplines and professions concerned with space. The concepts of 
space indigenous to physics are different from those indigenous to psychology, phe­
nomenology, architecture, or literary criticism. Again, you will want to define space 
by negation, apophatically, in order to distinguish your concept from mine. 
Figure 12.1 is an attempt to organize these concepts visually—to grasp their variety 
and to imagine them as a system.
Given the striking variety of concepts of space, one may want to ask why these 
concepts are numerous and disparate and how they relate to one another. Is there an 
underlying fundamental root concept of space, from which the numerous domain-­
specific concepts are derived? Another way to render this question is to ask whether 
concepts of space have a “focal meaning,” which is a concept occupying a central 
position in a network of concepts unified by their connection to that center or focus.2
Here I consider one manner of answering these questions, in the tradition of 
primacy of perception, i.e., assuming that our fundamental intuitions derive from 
perceptual experience.3 The approach presented here is reminiscent of the frame­
work of affordance, invented and articulated by the perceptual psychologist James 
Gibson (1966, 1979), then adopted in studies of design (Norman, 1999; Maier & 
Fadel, 2009). Gibson’s work on affordance can be usefully construed as an effort to 
describe possibilities of molar (versus molecular) behavior offered to the freely 
moving individual by the environment.
1 Ironically, the quoted text opens a book titled An Introduction to Space Perception. The author 
opens the book on “space perception” by elucidating that the latter phrase is misleading, leaving 
the reader is left in the straits of uncertainty, which is particularly injurious because it is unclear 
what kind of uncertainty it is. Is the uncertainty linguistic, where the word “perception” is a com­
mon homonym, which could mean, e.g., the process of perception or its outcome? Or is the uncer­
tainty of philosophical nature, where the author reveals his unstated ontological commitments, and 
which the reader is invited to tacitly share? Or is it an instance of professional signaling, and the 
author is merely trying to make a careful distinction between colloquial and technical terms?
2 The notion of focal meaning is a modern reading of Aristotle’s pros hen homonymy. (Pros hen is 
translated as “towards one”.) According to Owen (1960) who introduced this reading, Aristotle 
was asking whether multiple meanings of the verb “to be” had “one focus, one common element.” 
Similarly, one may want to ask whether the word “space” used in different disciplinary and profes­
sional contexts is a case of homonymy, where the word has the same spelling but different 
meanings.
3 In recent memory, this tradition is best known for its defense by the phenomenologist Maurice 
Merleau-Ponty (1964), but it was advocated broadly in other intellectual traditions that include 
empirical philosophy (e.g., Locke, 1847) and experimental psychology (e.g., Titchener, 1921).

Fig. 12.1  Concepts of space. Concepts of space are shown on an arc stretched between the con­
cepts that describe the observer-independent nature (left) and the concepts that describe artifacts of 
human culture (right). The white circles mark three landmarks that represent concepts of space in 
physics (A), direct experience (D), and imagination (G). Together with the stations represented by 
gray circles, we distinguish seven classes (or “species”) of concepts of space (Gepshtein, 2020). 
(A) Physical concepts are associated with various geometries and metrics, as in the classical 
Euclidian geometry, concerned with space alone, and the Minkowskian geometry, where space and 
time are combined in the four-dimensional manifold of space-time (Einstein, 1916; Jammer, 1954; 
Maudlin, 2012).
(B) Physiological concepts of space (the term “physiological space” was enunciated by Mach, 
1906) relate to neural mechanisms of perception and behavior. Examples include properties of 
hippocampal neural networks that encode cognitive maps of the individual’s surroundings used for 
navigation (Buzsáki & Moser, 2013) and neural networks in the cerebral cortex that underlie detec­
tion and discrimination of visual patterns (Ratliff, 1965; Gepshtein et al., 2022).
(C) Psychological concepts are used to construct public accounts of spatial perception and behav­
ior, such as path selection and navigation (Tolman, 1948); accounts of behavioral environment 
(contrasted with geographical environment; Koffka, 1935; Gibson, 1979); and in theories and 
models of perception, such as the concept of binocular disparity used to explain binocular vision 
and stereopsis (Julesz, 1971; Marr, 1982; Howard, 2002).
(D) Phenomenological concepts are used in descriptions of the private accounts of space. For 
instance, much of Merleau-Ponty’s seminal Phenomenology of Perception of 1945 is dedicated to 
phenomenological concepts of space. Bolnow (1963), Ströker (1987) and Morris (2004) offer 
more recent elaborations on the theme.
(E, F) Instrumental concepts are employed by the professions concerned with design and making. 
In station E, immersive space surrounds the individual, studied by designers of the built environ­
ment: in architecture, urban planning, landscape design, stage design, and by the newcomer profes­
sions concerned with virtual reality, augmented reality, and immersive cinema. In station F, the 
instrumental concepts associated with represented spaces are used, for example, in the analysis of 
figurative painting and traditional cinema (Arnheim, 1957; Pirenne, 1970; Kubovy, 1986; 
Kemp, 1990).
(G) Poetic concepts of space help to investigate imaginary or remembered spatial constructs, such 
as in the literary narrative (e.g., by means of literary chronotope; Bakhtin, 1982) or in retelling and 
reimagining the experience of the built environment (e.g., Bachelard, 1969)
12  Perceptual Space as a Well of Possibilities

126
Developed to counter the study of perception in exclusively analytical terms 
(Gibson, 1960), the framework of affordance applies to distributed patterns of per­
ception and behavior. For example, consider the part of the environment called 
“ground.” Grounds afford standing upon, walking upon, or crawling upon. These 
behaviors are some of the affordances of ground. Such different behaviors may have 
common constituents: elementary actions that add up to the behavior in question. 
But characterizing behavior in molar terms draws attention to those of its properties 
that are distributed across space and time, and thus define its unique character (e.g., 
as walking versus crawling).
Similarly, here I entertain the view that perceptual space is constituted by distrib­
uted patterns of possibilities of perception. On this view, understanding perception 
of space requires that we understand where possibilities of perception are located 
and how the possibilities available at different locations are organized in experience.
12.2  The Ring Model of Visual Space
Here I concentrate on visual space.4 Visual perception of objects is mediated by 
perception of their multiple attributes, sometimes called visual features, which 
include generic features (such as the shape, size, and color) and specific features 
(such as eyes on a face or leaves on a tree).
Imagine that there was a law that described the perceptibility of visual features as a 
function of their viewing distance, which is the distance separating a feature from the 
perceiver’s eye. Imagine further that, according to that law, the visibility of any feature 
was confined to a band of viewing distances. That is, the feature in question would be 
invisible from the viewing distances that are too long or too short (as we explain in the 
next section).5 Several consequences of such a law are illustrated in Fig. 12.2.
Every panel of Fig. 12.2 is a plan view of the ground on which the perceiver 
moves along the path represented by the curved arrow. Panel A contains one visual 
feature represented by the black star. The filled “ring” is the region from which the 
feature can be seen (as predicted by the law of visibility illustrated in Fig. 12.3). The 
curved arrow represents the path of a mobile perceiver.
Panel B offers the same view as panel A, but it contains another feature repre­
sented by the white star. The lightly filled ring is the region from which this second 
feature can be seen, predicted just as in panels A.
Panel C contains the same rings as in A and B, shown together to illustrate the region 
of their intersection, shaded in this panel (and reproduced in panel D). The shaded 
region represents the region of joint visibility of the features represented by the stars.
4 I use visual space to illustrate what appears to be a general property of perceptual spaces (includ­
ing acoustic, haptic, etc.). The questions of how perceptual spaces differ from one another and how 
they are coordinated are addressed elsewhere (e.g., Gepshtein & Banks, 2003; Alais & Burr, 2004; 
Gepshtein, 2009).
5 Failure to see features over long distance is a familiar to everyone. Failure to see features over 
short distance is less intuitive. The latter notion is explained in the next section (“A law of pattern 
visibility”) and in Figure 12.5.

Fig. 12.2  The ring model of visibility. Every panel represents a plan view of the ground. (A) A 
single elementary object (a visual feature) is represented by the black star. The filled annulus (a 
“ring”) is the region from which the feature can be seen, as predicted by a law of visibility explained 
in Fig. 12.3. The curved arrow represents the path of a mobile perceiver. (B) The same view as in 
panel A contains another feature represented by the white star. The lightly filled ring is the region 
from which this second feature can be seen, predicted just as in panels A. The curved arrow repre­
sents the path of a mobile perceiver, the same as in A. (C) The two rings from panels A–B are 
shown together, unfilled to illustrate the region of their intersection, filled. (D) The dark shape 
represents the region of joint visibility of the two features, derived by discovering the intersection 
of the annuli in panel C (Gepshtein 2020)
A person moving along the curved path will intermittently enter the region of 
joint visibility, where the path overlaps with the dark shape. Experience of this envi­
ronment will consist of a series of visual events, which together constitute the con­
tinuous visual experience of the environment.
12.3  A Law of Visibility
12.3.1  The ring model of pattern visibility
Here I describe the rationale behind the ring model introduced in the previous sec­
tion. Figure  12.3A is a visual scene that illustrates several typical properties of 
observation visual. Some of the features of this scene are window frames and

Fig. 12.3  Pattern visibility over distance. (A) A view of the built environment in which the density 
of detail and luminance contrast of visual features depend on distance from the viewer. (B) In this 
chart, the density of detail increases left to right, and luminance contrast increases top to bottom. 
The height at which the pattern is visible changes left to right, marked in the next panel. (C) The 
black curve marks the boundary separating the regions where image features are visible (below the 
curve) and invisible (above the curve). A portion of the horizontal line contained under the curve 
is the window of visibility—the range of densities of detail visible at this low contrast. (D) An 
image with a fixed density of detail is painted on a screen. The same screen with the same pattern 
painted on it is shown at three viewing distances. The contrast of the painted image is low,

mullions that form vertical arrangements whose apparent density depends on the 
viewing distance: the features viewed over long distances appear to have higher 
density than the features viewed over short distances. The contrast of these features 
also appears to vary with distance.
The image in panel B illustrates two factors that determine the visibility of such 
patterns: the density of detail and luminance contrast.6 The density of detail (for 
which the term of art is spatial frequency) increases in the image from left to right, 
whereas luminance contrast (henceforth contrast) increases top to bottom. The 
reader is invited to inspect this image and discover that visibility of detail depends 
on both the density of detail and the contrast.
The same image is shown in panel C with a black curve superimposed, represent­
ing the boundary that separates image regions where image features are visible (in 
the lower region, below the curve) and invisible (the upper region).7 A horizontal 
line is drawn at some law of contrast; a part of the line contained under the curve 
marks the range of densities of detail that is visible at this low contrast, labeled 
window of visibility in the figure. Notice that increasing the contrast (i.e., moving 
the horizontal line down) will increase the window of visibility so that that at high 
contrast the window of visibility will contain almost the full range of detail avail­
able in the image (visible at the bottom of the image).
In panel D, an image with a fixed density of detail is painted on a screen. The same 
screen is shown at three viewing distances; imagine the screen moving away from the 
perceiver, left to right in this figure. The fixed image has a low contrast, perhaps cor­
responding to the contrast marked in panel C by the horizontal lime. By nature of 
optical projection, increasing the viewing distance will lead to apparent increase in the 
density of detail (even as the density of detail in the image will not change).
The arrows drawn from D to C indicate how increasing the viewing distance will 
cause the same image painted on a moving screen in D will correspond to different 
horizontal locations in the chart in C. The leftmost and rightmost positions of the 
6 This image was first created by vision scientists Campbell and Robson (and described in 
Cornsweet, 1970). Luminance contrast is a measure of the difference between the lightest and 
darkest parts of the pattern.
7 In vision science, this boundary is called contrast sensitivity function (Cornsweet, 1970; Kelly, 
1979; Watson & Ahumada, 2016). Contrast sensitivity is defined as 1/L, where L is the amount of 
luminance contrast that makes the pattern just visible: the lower the contrast (called the threshold), 
the higher the perceiver’s sensitivity (Green & Swets, 1966).

nature of optical projection, increasing the viewing distance leads to an apparent increase in the 
density of detail even if the image does not change. The arrows drawn from D to C indicate sche­
matically how increasing the distance causes the same image painted on the screen to become 
invisible at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the screen. The range of viewing distances 
within the window of visibility is represented at the bottom of panel D by a gray area. This range 
of distances corresponds to the filled parts of rings of visibility shown in Fig. 12.2 (Gepshtein 2019)

screen in D will correspond to locations on the horizontal line in C that fall outside 
the window of visibility (which is outside the part of the horizontal line contained 
under the curved boundary of visibility in panel C). Between those two extreme 
locations of the screen in D, one can find the range of viewing distances that matches 
the window of visibility shown in C. That range of viewing distances is represented 
at the bottom of panel D by a gray area. The same range of viewing distances cor­
responds to the filled rings in Fig. 12.2A and B.
12.3.2  Testing The Ring Model with Architectural Robotics
An interdisciplinary team of researchers tested predictions of this model on the 
scale of architectural design, in a study commissioned by the Academy of 
Neuroscience for Architecture (Gepshtein et al., 2016). The team used industrial 
robots to carry a projector and a large screen (Fig. 12.4). Animated images were 
presented on the screen, while the screen and the projector were moving synchro­
nously to ensure a constant projector-to-screen distance. The projected images were 
drifting luminance gratings, which are blurred vertical bars moving left or right. 
Participants were seated as shown in the figure. Their task was to report, using a 
computer mouse, whether they saw leftward or rightward motion.
One result of this study is shown in Fig. 12.5. Two curves trace transition of vis­
ibility as a function of viewing distance: from nearly complete invisibility (at small 
distances) to nearly complete visibility (at larger distances), following a function 
predicted by the model. On the scale of architectural design, such transitions could 
happen over a relatively short range of distances: as short as half a meter: evident in 
gray curve in Fig. 12.5.
Notice that visibility plotted in Fig. 12.5 increases as a function of distance. 
This transition corresponds to inner radii of the ring of visibility shown in Fig. 12.2; 
one such ring of visibility is replicated in Fig. 12.5 at the right. Notice also that the 
changes of visibility plotted in Fig.  12.5 follow smooth functions rather than 
switch abruptly from low to high visibility. For convenience of description and 
modeling, differences between visibilities measured in different conditions are 
captured using the concept of threshold, noted in the preceding section and repre­
sented in Fig. 12.5 by the horizontal red line. For two conditions of measurement 
shown in Fig. 12.5, the threshold of visibility is attained at the viewing distance of 
about 2 meters at the contrast of 0.7% and at the viewing distance of just above 5 
meters at the contrast of 0.3%. The sharp edges used to draw rings of visibility are 
thresholds of visibility.

can be defined at a certain level of visibility, such as that represented in this figure by a horizontal 
red line. This boundary corresponds to the inner radius of the ring of visibility shown at right
12.4  Conclusions and Ramifications
12.4.1  The Focal Meaning of Concepts of Space
We started off with the observation that concepts of space are numerous and dispa­
rate. We asked whether there existed a root concept of space, of which the concepts 
used in different disciplines and professions were topical manifestations. The 
account presented here is a candidate for such a root concept.
The present approach is founded on the generic situation of a person who is mov­
ing and is sequentially exposed to specific possibilities of experience. This notion of 
sequential exposure to possibilities of experience is inherent in many concepts of 
space described in Fig. 12.1, including physiological, psychological, instrumental, 
and poetic. On this view, topical concepts of space differ from one another because 
various pertinent disciplines emphasize different aspects of experience even as the 
core process of sequential exposure to possibilities of experience remains the same. 
It is in this sense that our account of distributed experience can be thought of as a 
focal meaning of multiple concepts of space.
Against the connotation of space as void, our root account suggests that if space 
was void in the sense of absence of obstacles to movement, the void is structured. 
The structure is constituted by the boundaries of the regions of visibility illustrated 
in Fig. 12.2.8
8 In fact, the possibilities of movement perceptible at different locations in the map will tell the 
person where the obstacles are.
S. Gepshtein

133
Our approach is different from geometric approaches to perception of space, 
where perceptual space is described in terms borrowed from physics (e.g., Luneburg, 
1950; Indow, 1991).9 The alternative presented here is concerned with distributed 
possibilities of perception rather than with the geometry of space observed from a 
single location.
Circumscribing parts of spatial experience (as in Fig. 12.2) raises a litany of 
questions about how these parts are organized in the mind of a moving person. 
Different kinds of answers come to mind as we consider these questions “from 
below,” in terms of perceptual forces of cohesion, and “from above,” by viewing the 
distributed experience as a narrative.
12.4.2  Organization of Space from Below, Perceptually
In the view from below, the question is how fragments of perceptual experience are 
organized into perceptual wholes or objects. This line of inquiry was initiated by 
Gestalt psychology (Koffka, 1935; Smith, 1987) and it is continued today in experi­
mental psychology, cognitive sciences, and neurosciences under the rubric of “per­
ceptual organization” (Kubovy & Pomerantz, 1981; Gepshtein et  al., 2008; 
Wagemans et al., 2012a, 2012b). Traditionally, studies of perceptual organization 
pursued two kinds of questions: about perceptual grouping and about layering of 
experience into figure and ground. Studies of visual perceptual grouping asked 
which parts of the visual scene are organized into experience as visual objects. And 
studies of visual figure and ground asked which parts form figures that appear to 
stand in front of the ground that “fills in” behind figures.
Questions of perceptual organization have been usually posed for a stationary 
person. Our analysis suggests a broadening of approach, in which perceptual groups 
and figure/ground layers can arise, break, or reform as the person traverses the 
boundaries illustrated in Fig. 12.2. In the broadened framework, perceptual organi­
zation in the stationary observer is discoverable by asking where the parts are avail­
able concurrently (as in panels C and D of Fig. 12.2).10 And perceptual organization 
in the moving observer is discoverable by asking where parts of existing organiza­
tions become inaccessible or where new parts become accessible, causing percep­
tual reorganization.
The study of perceptual organization by a moving person has the potential to 
liberate this field of research from confines of the laboratory and two-dimensional 
stimulation. Gestalt phenomena are well known to designers, but famous illustra­
tions of grouping and figure-ground segregation come from the early days of Gestalt 
psychology. With rare exceptions (Arnheim, 1977), fruits of later work on 
9 MacLeod and Willen (1995) and Koenderink and van Doorn (2013) are illuminating reviews of 
geometric models of perceptual space.
10 In practice, such questions are raised by the architect, the city planner, and the landscape designer 
interested in the experience of architectural ensemble.
12  Perceptual Space as a Well of Possibilities

134
perceptual organization have not reached the community of designers working in 
immersive space (station E in Fig. 12.1; cf. Gepshtein & Snider, 2019).
12.4.3  Organization of Space from Above, Narratively
In the view from above, the question is how fragments of experience are organized 
into a larger narrative—verbal or nonverbal.11 The narrative theorist identifies two 
aspects of the narrative. One aspect is fabula, which is the sequence of narrated 
events in their chronological order. The other aspect is story (sometimes called 
sujet) in which the narrator can reorder events in the interest of convenience or artis­
tic effect, or to comply with demands of the medium, whether it is literary or paint­
erly, cinematic or architectonic.
Our account of ordered experiences is similar to the concept of fabula. The arrow 
in Fig. 12.2 represents the person’s path in the map. The path is akin to fabula in that 
it establishes the spatial and temporal order of events. A person moving along the 
path may have a series of experiences in the order defined by the regions of visibility 
encountered in the course of movement. If the path is likened to fabula, then the map 
is a representation of many fibulas offered by the environment.
Just as certain literary texts are said to be open to multiple ways of reading (opera 
aperta in Eco, 1984), one may argue that spatial environments are “open” in the 
sense that the moving person is free to choose her path. It appears, however, that the 
narrative openness of spatial environments is of different nature than the narrative 
openness described by Eco. In the artistic text, the fabula is fixed. In the spatial 
environment, the fabula is not fixed: It is selected by the moving person. It is in this 
sense that spatial environments are more “open” than artistic texts, open at both 
levels of sujet and fabula. Where many sujets may spring from the same fabula 
(along the same path), many fabulae (alternative paths) may spring from the same 
environment.
The choice of path by the freely moving person is the theme of a rapidly evolving 
area of empirical investigation. Concerned primarily with models of spatial reason­
ing and series of successive, spatially distributed choices (Maloney & Zhang, 2010; 
Snider et al., 2015; Miller & Venditto, 2021; Callaway et al., 2022), this literature 
engages many of the same concepts as narrative analysis, including counterfactual 
and abductive (retrograde) reasoning. But the connection between this literature and 
the analysis of spatial narrative is still to be made.
11 If we construe narrative as a representation, then the relationship between the approaches “from 
below” and “from above” has the following structure. In the view from below, perceptual organiza­
tion refers to how parts are rendered as a connected structure in experience. In the view from 
above, narrative refers to how parts are rendered as a connected structure in a medium (e.g., lin­
guistic, pictorial, tectonic).
S. Gepshtein

135
12.4.4  Space and Place
The relationship between the concepts of space and place is an influential theme in 
the literature on spatiality (Casey, 2013; Malpas, 2018). Studies of this relationship 
helped to overcome the mistake of conflating these concepts, with the caveat that the 
meanings of the words translated into English as “space” and “place” vary between 
languages, and some languages make no such distinction. In this literature, the con­
cept of space is taken to be secondary to, and derivative of, the concept of place.12
Here I used the locution of space rather than place because the former is pre­
dominantly used in empirical studies of perception. Still, the account of parts of 
experience distributed over time, and organized perceptually or narratively, can be 
readily construed as an account of place. For example, consider this description of 
place by Malpas (2018, p. 39):
The complexity of place is mirrored in the complex process of triangulation and traverse by 
which the topographical surveyor builds up a map of the region being surveyed. No single 
sighting is sufficient to gain a view of the entire region, multiple sightings are required, and 
every sighting overlaps, to some extent, with some other sighting…It is only through such 
journeying, sighting, and re-sighting that place can be understood.
One may reasonably assume that the content of sequential and overlapping “sight­
ings” noted in the above quotation is determined by the regions illustrated in 
Fig. 12.2. This reading of triangulation and traverse described by Malpas prompts 
many a question about organization of experience, similar to those we have just 
discussed. How are the noted sightings integrated into the experience of place? 
More generally, how is experience of place constructed multimodally, from the spa­
tially confined components arising through different sensory modalities? It appears 
that mapping these components—which is finding their boundaries and areas of 
overlap—amounts to an apt beginning of the empirical inquiry that will be able to 
answer these questions.

12 Of the concepts of space noted in Figure 12.1, it appears that it is physical space that this litera­
ture implies in making the contrast of space and place. It remains to be seen where other concepts 
of space stand in this context.

Affordances are action-possibilities. They are ways of relating to and acting on our 
world. From the moment we wake up in the morning, we’re constantly doing things: 
we check our phone, make coffee, get dressed, walk the dog, talk to people, take the 
subway, do our work, exercise, play games, go shopping, meditate, worship, and 
find ways to relax. We move through a world of affordances.
However, affordances are not just out there in the world. They are relative to the 
bodies who experience them. Different bodies perceive different sets of affordances; 
they inhabit different niches, as James Gibson refers to them. For an adult human, a 
chair affords sitting, standing on, or picking up. For infants, cats, lizards, and lady­
bugs, it affords none of these things—but it does afford crawling on or hiding under. 
Affordances emerge relationally, in the way these different bodies—with their 
unique structures, skills, habits, and histories—relate to the world. Affordances can 
help us understand how the same environment can mean different things to different 
animals. It can encompass different niches.
In this way, Gibson’s theory of affordances is a theory of access. It helps us 
understand how we have bodily access to bits of the world and what it means to 
enjoy such access. But a question Gibson doesn’t explicitly consider is what hap­
pens to bodies when this access is ruptured or impeded?
This question is relevant to psychopathology. Autistic people, for example, or 
people living with schizophrenia, clinical depression, obsessive-compulsive disor­
der, or anorexia nervosa often describe feeling as though they’ve lost access to bits 
of the world, to different affordances, that others take for granted. Some even 
describe feeling as though they inhabit a different world altogether. The way this

experience develops, as well as its intensity and character, may differ from case to 
case. But most people find it disturbing and isolating. They feel cut off from the 
possibility of connecting with others and participating in a shared world of meaning.
As we’ll see, thinking about the bodily consequences of losing access to every­
day affordances can help us better understand these reports. An affordance-based 
approach can illuminate some of the causes, as well as the experiential character and 
content, of affective disorders in psychopathology. It can also draw attention to 
some underexplored ethical and political dimensions of these issues needing further 
consideration.
13.2  Affordances and Absence in Schizophrenia 
and Depression
Discussions of affordances often adopt a task-oriented perspective. They focus on 
how people, things, and spaces afford practical action. People afford shaking hands 
and talking; keyboards afford typing, chairs sitting, and hammers hammering; 
nightclubs afford dancing and bars drinking. And this is fine. Affordances play a key 
role in shaping how the world becomes present as a space of practical action.
However, this task-oriented focus can overlook the role affordances play in shap­
ing our affective life. By “affective,” I simply mean the rich array of moods, emo­
tions, and other feelings that form the felt texture of our being-in-the-world. We 
don’t just think and act. We feel things. And we construct niches that both reflect 
and regulate aspects of our affective lives at multiple timescales.
For example, if we are upset about something, we might seek the comfort of 
friends, wander through a familiar space (a favorite gallery, cafe, park, or worship 
space), binge-watch trash TV, slip into comfortable pajamas, drink Belgian beer, 
play computer games, do yoga, read poetry, listen to music, post a sad selfie on 
social media to get support from friends, or simply take a nap. Things and spaces—
including online spaces (Krueger & Osler, 2019)—afford more than just practical 
actions. They afford affect regulation. We modify the world—specifically, the vari­
ous niches that are part of it—to modify our affective life (Colombetti & 
Krueger, 2015).
How does this relate to psychopathology? Simply put, in conditions like schizo­
phrenia and depression, individuals often lose access to regulative resources within 
everyday niches—and the stability of their affective life is compromised. 
Accordingly, if we try to understand affective disorders in psychiatric illness just by 
looking inside the individual (e.g., their neurobiology), we fail to capture the full 
causal complexity of the processes involved in shaping their disordered experience. 
Instead, we need to bring the world, including the affordances that are part of it, 
back into the story.
To see how so, let us revisit the notion of “access” and consider its connection 
with trust. Part of why our niches do the regulative work they do is because we 
J. Krueger

143
enjoy reliable access to them. We feel at home in them and therefore trust them. We 
trust our niches because we often set them up ourselves (e.g., our home or office). 
Other niches, such as a gym or public transport system, are set up by others. 
Nevertheless, we trust these niches, too, because we know what they mean, that is, 
what they afford and what it’s appropriate to do (and not do) when we inhabit them.
But consider next how it feels when something goes wrong: our smartphone dies 
and the music abruptly stops in the middle of an intense workout; the Wi-Fi in our 
office building goes down and we feel powerless to work; a wheelchair lift we rely 
on is out of order; we’re uncomfortable when approached by a distressed person 
speaking loudly and wearing dirty clothing; we hear a racist slur directed our way 
or feel a stranger’s hand on our thigh while on the subway; we walk into a party and 
see a table of drinks that pulls on our hard-won sobriety.
In these cases, the world stops working the way we expect it to. We lose trust and 
feel disoriented. Even if it’s only a brief experience, a mild sense of disorientation, 
this loss of trust arises because we are suddenly aware that some affordances we’d 
previously taken for granted are now missing. We experience these affordances as 
present via their absence.1 And pieces of our affective life go with them. Without the 
motivation of our music, finishing a punishing workout suddenly feels like an 
impossible task. We are unable to joyfully lose ourselves in a book during our morn­
ing commute once our personal space has been threatened.
What I’ve described here are familiar everyday cases where our sense of reality 
“wobbles” (Ratcliffe, 2015) in some way and we lose trust in the world. Most of us 
regain this trust quickly enough as we adapt and move on. However, there are 
cases—such as schizophrenia and clinical depression—where this loss of trust is 
more global and persistent. In these cases, individuals no longer feel at home in a 
world they share with others. This is clear in how they describe their experience. 
Clinically depressed patients say things like “It is the glass wall that separates us 
from life, from ourselves, that is so truly frightening in depression...It is like living 
in a parallel universe” (Brampton, 2008, p. 171). We hear similar reports from peo­
ple with schizophrenia: “I feel disconnected”; “A wall of void isolated me from 
everybody”; and “It is as if there were two worlds” (Stanghellini & Rosfort, 2013, 
p. 246).
Schizophrenia and depression are not the same thing, of course. But they do 
share some phenomenological similarities. For my purposes, what is interesting is 
that this feeling of being cut off from the world seems to flow from a disturbed sense 
of embodiment that impedes the individual’s ability to affect, and be affected by, 
others and the world more generally (de Haan & Fuchs, 2010). Individuals with 
schizophrenia and depression often describe feeling as though they don’t fit into 
their body the way others do; they feel alienated from their body and lack the ability 
to do things, respond to, and be affected by the world in a spontaneous way. 
Sometimes they even experience their body as an object that must be overcome to 
access the world.

13  Affordances and Absence in Psychopathology

144
These bodily disturbances change how individuals experience the niches they 
share with others, including the things and spaces that make up these niches. They 
experience various affordances as present via their absence. For example, some 
people with schizophrenia describe being drawn to the empty space surrounding 
people and things instead of the things themselves (Jaspers, 1963, p. 81). Others 
perceive objects as fragmented, flat, shifting, unrelated to one another, or distilled to 
pure geometric qualities that lack meaning (Silverstein et al., 2017). One person 
says “Everything around me is immobile. Things appear isolated, each one in itself, 
without suggesting anything. Certain things which ought to evoke memory, evoke 
an immense number of thoughts...remain isolated. They are more understood than 
experienced” (Minkowski, 1970, p.  276). These individuals are aware that their 
experience of the world and its affordances differs from others.
In depression, the world can be experienced as similarly inaccessible, as bodily 
out of reach: “You look at the world, the array of things that you could do and 
they’re completely meaningless to you. They are as meaningless to you as if you 
were an earthworm” (Karp, 1996, p. 32). Echoing reports from people with schizo­
phrenia, some people even describe feeling a global shift in how they experience the 
meaning of the world and things in it. This can mean that things no longer exert the 
affective pull one might expect: “Living with depression is like living in black and 
white when everyone else is living in color” (Benson et al., 2013, p. 73). But it can 
also suggest that the meaning of specific things, their affordances, has shifted—and 
subsequently, their regulative significance, too. Windows that once afforded looking 
through to savor the light and landscape now beckon relentlessly as a portal to a 
quick death; a fancy kitchen knife that previously summoned happy memories of 
shared meals and laughter now affords cutting human flesh and ending one’s pain 
(Krueger & Colombetti, 2018).
The takeaway point is that in these cases, a disturbance of one’s bodily relation 
to the world leads to a loss of trust—a sense that one no longer has access to the 
same niches, the same affordances, that others enjoy. Some affordances are experi­
entially present via their absence. As a result, individuals no longer feel at home in 
the world. They feel disoriented, cut off from a shared world of interpersonal mean­
ing. But part of this feeling arises from a loss of access to the material environment, 
too. When individuals lose access to regulative resources within their everyday 
niches—particularly in an enduring way, such as with schizophrenia and clinical 
depression—the stability and organization of their affective life is deeply 
compromised.
13.3  Affordances and Absence in Autism
As we’ve seen, affordances not only guide action. They regulate affect. Our niches 
do some of this work for us—often transparently, in the background—as we find our 
way through everyday life. They are set up to make us feel at home in them. But this 
is not the case for all niches. Some are set up to deprive certain people of access to 
J. Krueger

145
certain affordances. This might be deliberate; or it might not. Either way, it reminds 
us that our niches have ethical and political significance (Heras-Escribano, 2019; 
Crippen & Klement, 2020).
Critical phenomenologists like Sara Ahmed (2007) explore the bodily impact of 
inhabiting hostile niches configured to deliberately constrain certain bodies (e.g., 
queer bodies, severely ill or disabled bodies, non-white bodies) and their access to 
certain affordances. For example, Ahmed develops her phenomenology of “being 
stopped” to explore what it’s like for non-white bodies, or those with “suspicious” 
(i.e., “terrorist sounding”) names, to be stopped by the police more than other kinds 
of bodies. But this stopping can occur in other contexts, too, such as when non-­
white bodies are bombarded with racist images and memes online or passed over for 
a job promotion despite being equally well-qualified.
For Ahmed, this stopping doesn’t just place practical constraints on stopped bod­
ies. It has affective consequences, too. It induces a feeling of disorientation: a feel­
ing that one’s body is deeply out-of-sync with the world. This is because the threat 
of being stopped is pervasive, materially encoded in how some affordances (e.g., 
freedom of movement, access to certain spaces) are presented as accessible for 
some bodies but not others. Some affordances are experientially present via their 
absence. As a result, “[t]hose who get stopped are moved in a different way” as they 
find their way through the world (Ahmed, 2007, p. 162).
This perspective can help us understand the narratives of some people with autis­
tic spectrum disorder (ASD). They describe feeling that to be an autistic person is 
the world is to be a stopped body (Krueger, 2021a, b). Often, autistic bodies are 
stopped from extending into and taking shape within the spaces they inhabit—
niches designed to primarily accommodate how neurotypical bodies move, speak, 
act, and relate. This stopping leads to experiences of disorientation and a loss of 
trust. It involves an enduring feeling that one is not at home or welcome in 
these spaces.
From a neurotypical perspective, autistic people may have unusual styles of 
embodiment (Krueger, 2021a, b). The timing and flow of their movements can seem 
strange or inappropriate. They may have an unusual gait or posture or have tics and 
habits (hand-flapping, spinning, etc.) that are off-putting for people not accustomed 
to them. They may also repeatedly shrug, squint, pout, or rock back and forth; 
appear “stuck” in indecisive movements for a long time; turn away from social 
encounters; or repeatedly touch or handle a particular object.
Many people with ASD feel that their bodily style does not fit smoothly into 
neurotypical niches, even if they don’t understand how or why this is so, exactly. 
This can be confusing and frustrating: “I have been endlessly criticized about how 
different I looked, criticized about all kinds of tiny differences in my behavior...no 
one ever tried to really understand what it was like to be me…” (Robledo et al., 
2012, p. 6). What reports like this convey is that for many people with ASD, moving 
through neurotypical niches involves a perpetual anticipation of being stopped. 
They struggle to comfortably extend themselves into spaces organized around the 
form, and norms, of neurotypical bodies. Instead, they feel that the way they 
13  Affordances and Absence in Psychopathology

146
experience and use their bodies is frowned upon when in these spaces (Krueger & 
Maiese, 2018).
For example, for many people with ASD, it is acceptable to avoid making eye 
contact when speaking with someone, take a long pause before responding (Leary 
& Donnellan, 2012), or provide direct answers to potentially sensitive questions 
(“Do I look good in this shirt?”; “No, you do not!”) (Chapman, 2019, p. 430). But 
these practices are discouraged in neurotypical niches. The feeling of being stopped 
also applies to self-directed bodily practices of “self-stimulation” (or “self-stims”)—
hand-flapping, finger snapping, tapping objects, repetitive vocalizations, or rocking 
back and forth—that help people with ASD manage incoming sensory information 
and feel rooted in their bodies and the world. These things can confuse neurotypical 
people or make them uncomfortable. Treatment programs, often developed with 
little input from people with ASD, traditionally try to suppress or eliminate them.
The feeling of being stopped is not limited to face-to-face interactions. It also 
arises when dealing with the built environment. A noisy, brightly lit lecture hall, 
restaurant, or retail space, for instance, may negatively impact an individual with 
ASD’s auditory and visual hypersensitivity in ways neurotypical bodies don’t 
understand or appreciate. For people with ASD, the design of these spaces does not 
afford feeling at home. Instead, they are disorienting and bodily upsetting. As a 
result, possibilities for social connection and shared experience—beyond whatever 
practical actions these spaces afford—are experienced as bodily out of reach.
These observations indicate that some of the social difficulties people with ASD 
face aren’t caused just by things going on inside their head (e.g., neurocognitive 
deficits, as is often assumed). Instead, they arise relationally, in the way that many 
everyday niches are not set up to be flexible and responsive to neurodivergent styles 
of embodiment and expression. These niches limit access to affordances that neuro­
typical bodies take for granted.
Accordingly, an affordance-based approach to ASD draws our attention to the 
role that bodily, interactive, and spatial features play in shaping social difficulties in 
ASD. And this is significant for intervention and treatment. It suggests that instead 
of trying to “fix” the heads of people with ASD (i.e., expecting them to conform to 
neurotypical styles of embodiment and thinking), we ought to instead construct 
niches that are more flexible and inclusive. For example, we should consider how 
things like colors, lights, textures, sounds, and smells may potentially disorient neu­
rodivergent styles of embodiment and sensory processing and adjust our design 
approach accordingly. It also suggests that neurotypicals—and not just people with 
ASD—may benefit from social skills training. This may help them become more 
sensitive to and comfortable with neurodivergent ways of being in the world. By 
widening our perspective in the ways discussed above, an affordance-based 
approach equips us with some of the theoretical resources needed for this task.

Affordances and 3E Psychopathology
Kristopher Nielsen
14.1  Introduction
The intention of this essay is firstly to demonstrate that the concept of affordances 
is an extremely useful tool in the study of mental disorders. As part of this, I will 
overview a selection of recent works that apply the concept of affordances in inter­
esting ways within analyses of psychopathology or of particular disorder concepts. 
Secondly, my intention is to suggest that there is a potential danger in the use of 
affordances within the study of mental disorder. As the concept of affordances itself 
shows us, any tool—tangible or conceptual—can constrain and direct our approach 
to a task. We cannot let such constraint blind us to the need for a plurality of 
approaches. The concept of affordances is a vital tool but must remain one tool 
among many when we are seeking to understand something as complex as mental 
disorder.
Breaking this essay down by section, I will first orient the reader to my own 
conceptual position of 3E Psychopathology. This will allow the reader to under­
stand the conceptual ground on which the essay stands and highlight the multi-scale 
complexity of these things we currently call mental disorders. In the second section, 
I will overview a selection of works that utilize the concept of affordances to richly 
describe and contribute to our understanding of mental disorders. I will also briefly 
describe how I use the concept of affordances in my therapeutic work as a clinical 
psychologist. Finally, in the third section, I will discuss the role that I can see for 
affordance-based thinking within a 3E-based science of psychopathology and the 
need for a plurality of approaches.

14.2  3E Psychopathology
My particular approach to conceptualizing mental disorders is grounded in three 
principles concerning the nature of human functioning and the mind. These are 
the principles of embodiment, embedment, and enactivism—hence 3E 
Psychopathology. These three principles have a rich history within philosophy of 
mind and the cognitive sciences that I do not have room to unpack here. Suffice to 
say that together they summarize a naturalistic and non-reductive conception of 
human functioning. This is a conception that holds the mind to be non-dualistic 
and dynamically constituted by the entire body rather than simply the brain 
(embodied), shaped by and deeply integrated with the physical and sociocultural 
environment (embedded), and, finally, geared for action and deeply concerned 
with meaning, which emerges from the needful relationship between the precari­
ous organism and their environment (enactive). For more on this conception of 
human functioning, see Thompson (2007). Note that I do not incorporate ideas of 
extension/4E cognition due to concerns regarding a tension between such ideas 
and the bodily focus of embodiment/enactivism, a worry that ideas of extension 
move too far from everyday language, and a belief that a principle of embedded­
ness can achieve much the same ends. For full explanation of this, see 
Nielsen (2020).
From this 3E perspective, and considering the evidence that the causes of mental 
disorder are best seen as dappled across the brain, body, and environment (Kendler, 
2012), I have proposed that mental disorders are best seen as dynamic and reafferent 
patterns that exist across the brain-body-environment system, keeping people stuck 
in behaviors that do not ultimately serve their own needs and purposes (Nielsen, 
2020). Such patterns constitute a disruption to the embodied sense-making pro­
cesses of the individual, a conclusion also supported by other authors in the area (de 
Haan, 2020; Maiese, 2021)—although my view is somewhat more mechanistically 
oriented (Nielsen, 2021). On this view, the disorder or dysfunction present is not one 
of a part not performing its function, nor of a societal-level judgment that a behavior 
is abnormal or wrong, but instead an evaluation that someone is repetitively and 
inflexibly acting against their own best interests at the cost of their faring well in life 
(Maiese, 2021; Nielsen & Ward, 2020a). From this perspective, it makes sense that 
mental disorders such as “depression” do not look exactly the same across individu­
als. Instead they can be defined by the similarity of the overall patterns observed 
across individuals.
If we are to better understand and explain mental disorders from this 3E perspec­
tive, then one important way to do so will be to seek to perceive the constituent 
phenomena within these psychopathological patterns at multiple scales of inquiry 
(e.g., what does the phenomenon of hypervigilance in PTSD look like at the scale 
of the genetic, physiological, neurological, behavioral, experiential, and interper­
sonal). Situated in this richer understanding, we could then hypothesize about how 
these phenomena relate to each other and thus how the wider pattern manages to 
hang together and maintain within a person’s experience and behavior, despite the 
K. Nielsen

151
fact that it is negatively impacting them (Nielsen & Ward, 2020b). One further way 
that we may seek to better understand mental disorder from this view is to consider 
an individual’s “mode of functioning.” How, within their particular sociocultural 
niche, have they learnt to survive and thrive in the world, and what has changed so 
that this mode of functioning is no longer working for them (Nielsen, 2020)? This 
second approach to explanation is geared more toward understanding the emer­
gence of these psychopathological patterns within individuals rather than why these 
patterns maintain at a nomothetic (“across-people”) level.
Under both of these approaches to explaining mental disorder from a 3E perspec­
tive, it is necessary to understand the experiences of those stuck in pattern of dis­
tress. This is because, from the principle of enactivism, human beings (and all 
creatures) live lives perfused with meaning, and this meaning shapes our behavior. 
To borrow a term from Colombetti (2014), there is a primordial affectivity to our 
experience (and all life). We perceive the world not from an objective standpoint, 
but from a position of concern. The meaning we enact is immediate in our experi­
ence of the world and is a vital component of understanding behavior. For example, 
when someone with arachnophobia spots a potential spider, fear literally ripples 
through their whole body, re-orienting attention and preparing the body for per­
ceived threat, all due to what a spider means for them. If we are to understand the 
complex and often seemingly baffling behavior observed in mental disorder, we 
must then understand the meaning at play. Thomas Fuchs, a researcher and psychia­
trist who has played a key role in the extension of enactive ideas to the study and 
conception of psychopathology, even goes so far as to say that “phenomenology 
may…be considered the foundational science for psychopathology” (Fuchs, 2010). 
This then brings us to the role of affordances.
Similar to the original definition offered by Gibson (1977), from an enactive 
perspective, affordances can be thought of as “meanings for action.” As creatures 
built to act, when we make sense of an object or situation in the world, we perceive 
those opportunities for action that accord with our particular bodies, capacities, hab­
its, and current intentions. As with all meaning, from an enactive perspective, affor­
dances are seen as relational (Thompson, 2007). They pertain to the relationship 
between the embodied organism and the environment rather than being simple facts 
about that environment. The concept of affordances then is one that allows us to 
break down and better understand the immanent meaning for action present in 
someone’s experience of the world. If mental disorders are indeed disruptions in an 
individual’s ways of making sense of and responding to the world—as proposed by 
the emerging 3E perspective—then the concept of affordances is clearly going to be 
a useful conceptual tool for their study.

14.3  The Utility of Affordances for Understanding 
Mental Disorders
In order to demonstrate the utility of affordance-based thinking for understanding 
mental disorders, this section will briefly summarize a selection of works that have 
developed the concept of affordances for this purpose and for modelling particular 
disorder concepts. As a note, for reasons of space, it is not my intention to engage 
with these works critically. I will then make a brief comment on the utility of 
affordance-­based thinking in a therapeutic context based on my own experience.
De Haan et al. (2013) present the idea of a field of affordances: that selection of 
affordances that an individual is responsive to in a particular situation. This field is 
conceptualized along three dimensions, those of width, depth, and height. Width 
refers to the range of different affordances an individual is responsive to, depth 
refers to the temporal awareness of how affordances are likely to shift with time and 
our own action, and height refers to the salience of different action possibilities. 
These authors go on to example how this allows for consideration of different men­
tal disorders. They example that depression can be understood as a flattening of the 
field of affordances in height (i.e., a reduction in motivation/salience of possibilities 
for action), a narrowing in width (i.e., a reduction in flexibility/the perception of 
different action possibilities), and a shrinking in depth (i.e., a reduction in future 
orientation to action possibilities). They also discuss how obsessive-compulsive dis­
order, the focus of their analysis, can be understood as the dominance of compulsive 
actions within their field of affordances. The compulsive action(s) are of high affec­
tive salience, demand completion before other actions can be completed, and 
obscure the perception of other action possibilities—thus keeping people stuck in 
repetitive action.
Within a wider discussion of what mental disorder looks like from an embodied, 
embedded, and enactive worldview, Maiese (2021) has recently discussed the role 
of affordances in the normative constitution of mental disorder. Across different 
contexts in life, she points out that it is necessary for us to enact different roles/
modes of functioning so as to stay attuned to the needs of that context. Maiese refers 
to these different modes as regional identities. Each regional identity is seen as a 
different collection of interrelated habits/sensorimotor schemes, partially consti­
tuted by the differential saliences of affordances across contexts, so as to allow good 
functional fit with the requirements of the kind of situation that the regional identity 
was developed for. For example, a different field of affordances will present them­
selves to a doctor entering a hospital when they enter as a doctor, as a patient, or as 
a support person for their friend. Incorporating this idea, Maiese proposes that men­
tal disorders in general often concern the deregulated enaction of these regional 
identities, thus producing dis-attunement with the sense-making of the individual 
and the needs of their context. Such a dis-attunement of sense-making appears to be 
referring to and building on the idea of functional fit between an organism’s pattern 
of engagement and their environment, i.e., whether a behavior is working for the 
organism (Nielsen & Ward, 2020a). Maiese’s use of language such as identity and

selves is a potential source of confusion here and potentially invites tension with the 
principle of embodiment—i.e., is Julie-the-engineer really a different person to 
Julie-the-mother? However, her wider point about the need to attune our sense-­
making to our particular context—even at the unconscious level of the salience of 
particular affordances—and the role this can play in psychopathology is a fascinat­
ing and useful one.
Another interesting and recent use of affordances in the study of mental disorder 
comes from Krueger and Colombetti (2018). These authors build on notions of 
affective affordances and affective niche construction. They make the observation 
that in normal life, it is common for people to regulate their affective state by con­
structing an environment that scaffolds their emotions, thus supporting mood regu­
lation. As examples, we carry lucky charms, we listen to different kinds of music to 
evoke sought-after emotional states, we may seek out friends when we are sad, and 
we decorate different rooms to evoke mood states that are fit for the room’s purpose. 
Considering depression and schizophrenia in particular, these authors begin with 
noting the alterations in the field of affordances described by sufferers of these con­
ditions that play a role in continuing distress. Very briefly summarizing, depression 
is described as a general flattening out of the field of affordances in terms of salience/
motivation, with those affordances that do break through as salient often having a 
negative impact on mood and well-being. For example, observing as salient possi­
bilities for sleep,  continued inaction, self-harm, or suicide. Schizophrenia is 
described as a dysregulation of the salience of affective affordances/felt meaning, 
resulting in an experience of un-worlding or alienation. These authors also discuss 
fascinating differences in how sufferers of these conditions often experience their 
own body, but I do not have room to discuss this here. One of Krueger and 
Colombetti’s most useful observations, however, is in reference to the bidirectional 
relationship between a person experiencing mental disorder and their environment. 
They describe how depressed individuals often appear to construct affective niches 
that reinforce their depressed mood state. Due to their depressed mood state and the 
effect of this on their field of affordances, individuals may keep curtains shut, not 
bother to buy nutritious and enjoyable food, reduce engagement with friends and 
exercise, etc. In those with schizophrenia, the authors describe how perceptual 
abnormalities can be seen to disrupt the field of affordances to the point that the 
world is perceived as significantly less coherent and becomes alienating or even 
threatening, and thereby behavior becomes disorganized. While Krueger and 
Colombetti do not mention this specifically, it is interesting to consider here how the 
behaviors facilitated by this perception of the world (e.g., talking to one’s self or 
looking at people with suspicion) often evoke distrust and the expression of suspi­
cion from others, again forming a potential positive feedback loop. In summary, 
Krueger and Colombetti’s analysis suggests that when studying mental disorders 
through an affordance-based lens, we should not only consider the nature of the 
affordances that those suffering from disorder perceive. Rather, we must also con­
sider the affordances that people generate for themselves over time and how this can 
play a role in perpetuating the dynamic circular patterns of distress and dysfunction 
that constitute mental disorder.
14  Affordances and 3E Psychopathology

154
There are likely many further examples of the utility of affordance-based think­
ing for the study of mental disorders. We can briefly consider the “collapse” of the 
field of affordances in substance dependency, where behavioral possibilities associ­
ated with gaining access to the relevant substance likely appear with great saliency 
and other affordances important for daily living fade into the background. Similarly, 
in anorexia nervosa, we might speculate about the likely altered affordances pro­
vided by food items and by the body. However, given the cross-disciplinary and 
scholastic intentions of this collection of essays, I thought it may be of greater inter­
est to briefly consider how I have personally found affordance-based thinking to be 
useful in a related but more practical task: that of therapy.
When working in a psychotherapeutic context, one of the key tasks is to help a 
client understand their own presenting problem. Moreover, this task has practical 
intentions—to help the client identify areas within their experience where they may 
have more control than they realize. In a sense, we can think of therapy as collabora­
tive sense-making about the client’s own sense-making processes. Connected to 
this, drawing a client’s attention to the affordances salient to them at any given 
moment can often be a helpful maneuver. If I as a therapist invite a client to take 
note of what their environment affords them and how their field of affordances 
changes in a dynamic way—that often accords with their emotional state—this can 
be one route to begin to structure greater affective awareness and agency.
A clinical example that comes to mind includes a man experiencing attacks of 
unexplained anger during a period of stress. Through consideration of the affor­
dances salient to him during these attacks, we were able to recognize that what he 
was experiencing were actually panic attacks—a relatively normal phenomenon—
masked by the fact that he had never learned to recognize and label fear. Recognizing 
this reduced feelings of confusion and anger, allowing us to develop some fitting 
coping strategies, and the attacks consequently stopped. Another example would be 
a young woman experiencing PTSD following sexual assault. Through learning to 
observe that, in her state of hypervigilance, every male of the street afforded scan­
ning and evaluation for threat, she was able to observe that constantly following this 
afforded action only exacerbated her sense of stress and fear over time. Recognizing 
and labelling this affordance allowed her to accept that this behavior made sense in 
light of her past experience but also highlighted that she had more power over her 
fear than she realized. By learning to more explicitly consider the affordances 
salient to them, clients gain greater opportunity to choose their actions and disrupt 
habits that may be helping to hold them in distress. They may also with time gain 
greater awareness that certain actions have the capacity to alter, or reinforce, their 
current emotional/mood state. I wish to stress that these are nothing but my own 
observations as a relatively novice therapist, but I thought it may be of interest to the 
reader to consider how affordance-based thinking can be useful for considering and 
coming to understand mental disorders—not just in a scientific sense but in an expe­
riential and first-personal sense.

14.4  One Tool Among Many
Hopefully I have by now sufficiently demonstrated how affordance-based thinking 
has significant utility for the study and understanding of mental disorders. Through 
evoking a sense of empathy, allowing us to imagine the embodied experience of 
someone stuck in a pattern of mental disorder, models grounded in notions of affor­
dance seem to evoke a deep sense of understanding. In other words, they often 
appear to make mental disorders “make sense.” However, I want to also highlight 
that there is a potential danger in this sense of understanding. Somewhat ironically, 
affordance-based thinking is the perfect tool to help us understand this. When we 
hold a hammer in our hands, our affordance space is constrained by the tool we hold 
and many objects around us take on a hittable quality, decreasing the salience of 
other action possibilities. In the same way, use of a particular method of analysis—
such as affordance-based thinking—can constrain our theoretical and investigative 
possibilities.
Our reason for wanting to understand mental disorders in the first place is pri­
marily to afford us power over them: to reveal handholds that will allow us to 
develop better treatments and alleviate suffering. Following assumptions of embodi­
ment and embedment, we must recognize that mental disorders are multi-scale and 
constitutionally complex things. Understanding experience and the role of affor­
dances in perpetuating distress is absolutely necessary—and it is also not enough. 
We must also seek to understand the constitutional structure of mental disorders—
what they look like at multiple scales of inquiry and from multiple points of view. 
To put it another way, we need to ask further questions about how these alterations 
in experience and a person’s field of affordances are situated in a social and physical 
context and how they are constituted within the body. Such a goal demands a plural­
ity of methods and indeed a plurality of conceptual approaches. Affordance-based 
thinking is a fascinating and useful tool for studying mental disorders, but it must 
remain one tool in the psychopathologist’s toolbox.

15.1  Introduction
When we think about decisions in our own lives, we usually have in mind a process 
of selection between a limited set of clear-cut offers, such as a choice between our 
favorite restaurants, available venues to host an event, or different goods to buy 
online. These economic choices have received significant attention in economics, 
psychology, and neuroeconomics (Glimcher & Rustichini, 2004; Padoa-Schioppa, 
2011; Rangel et al., 2008), but an overemphasis on this subset of decision-making

may have imparted a false optimism that our decision models are fully mature and 
our understanding of these processes nearly complete.
On the contrary, there is another important class of decisions, likely even more 
common than their economic counterparts, which exhibit tremendous complexity 
and for which our understanding and ability to develop computational models is still 
in its infancy. This class is what we call embodied decisions which have mostly been 
overlooked by rigorous investigation to date (Cisek & Pastor-Bernier, 2014; Lepora 
& Pezzulo, 2015; Yoo et al., 2021). Embodied decisions involve the continuous 
selection between present affordances (e.g., different routes to take in traffic) as 
well as future affordances that we create, or destroy, by acting (e.g., by selecting a 
certain route, we close off opportunities to select alternative routes later on). 
Embodied decisions were key for adaptive behavior in our evolutionary ancestors, 
and their neural mechanisms have been conserved for hundreds of millions of years 
(Rodrı́guez et al., 2002; Saitoh et al., 2007; Striedter & Northcutt, 2019), providing 
the context for the more modern innovations of neural circuitry in mammals and 
primates (Cisek, 2019; Passingham & Wise, 2012). Embodied decisions still remain 
pervasive in our daily lives. Navigating as pedestrians or drivers, organizing items 
on our desk, and playing sports with friends are, for many of us, familiar activities 
requiring numerous embodied decisions to successfully complete.
Embodied choices differ from economic choices in a number of fundamental 
ways: they present living organisms with unique challenges and require different 
conceptualizations (and perhaps also recruit distinct brain circuits). For example, 
classical economic decisions are typically decomposed into sequential phases 
(Fodor, 1983; Pylyshyn, 1984): perception of salient attributes, decision between 
alternatives, and reporting of the final decision by action (i.e., decide-then-act). 
However, this decomposition does not work well in the embodied paradigm, where 
perception, decision, and action processes are recurrent and intertwined. Consider, 
for example, the case of a driver who is deciding whether or not to overtake another 
car. To make this decision, the driver might continuously seek potential (overtake­
ability) affordances created by the left or right movements of the other car. By 
adjusting her own relative road position (e.g., moving to the center), she may exhibit 
what Eleanor Gibson calls prospectivity, in which future overtakeability affordances 
are created via anticipatory action (Gibson, 1997). Furthermore, the decision itself 
is temporally extended rather than instantaneous: after beginning to overtake, the 
driver may accelerate more aggressively or even abort her plan and brake if she 
spots a car in the opposite direction. As this example shows, embodied decisions are 
hardly separable into different phases: they are continuous and often imply situa­
tions in which decision-makers utilize action as a constituent of the decision-­making 
process, continuously reconsider affordances and action outcomes, and can change 
their mind along the way (Cisek & Pastor-Bernier, 2014; Lepora & Pezzulo, 2015; 
Yoo et al., 2021). Furthermore, this example shows that in embodied decisions, 
action components are much more prominent than in classical settings, in which 
actions are simply ways to report an already formed decision, rather than part and 
parcel of it. More broadly, not just action components but embodied and situated 
aspects become more crucial. As we will describe, most embodied decisions can be

cast in terms of the selection between affordances, which are by definition relational 
entities, as they depend on brain-body-environment relationships and interactions 
(Beer, 1995; Borghi, 2004; Costantini et  al., 2011; Gibson, 1979; Nolfi, 2011; 
Pezzulo et al., 2010).
Another key difference between economic and embodied decisions is that while 
the latter are classically constructed as choices between a small fixed number of 
offers (in many studies, just two) that are pre-specified by the experimenter, this is 
rarely the case during embodied decisions. In the latter, the number of alternatives 
for the deliberative process (e.g., the alternative paths to be considered when driv­
ing) is not fixed. Rather, possible trajectories, and the decision landscape (or affor­
dance landscape) within which they are embedded, are dynamical and change 
continuously, influenced by the environment as well as by the actions of the 
decision-­maker (Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016).
15.2  Novel Questions Raised by Embodied Decisions 
and How to Address Them
These and other unique features of embodied decisions raise exciting new ques­
tions. For example, how do we perceive affordances and how does affordance per­
ception guide our decision processes? What are the key choice dimensions that 
guide the selection between action alternatives or affordances? Are the dimensions 
of embodied choices largely stable across contexts (e.g., driving, walking, playing 
basketball) or predominantly context-dependent? How do people estimate these 
choice dimensions (and also the relevant potential alternatives that enter the delib­
eration) under the significant uncertainty associated with sensorimotor settings? 
How do people deliberate between present and future affordances? What are the 
neuronal circuits that are especially relevant in embodied choice processes? How do 
perceptual, decision, and action processes deploy during embodied decisions, how 
do they influence each other, and to what extent can they be separated?
Some studies have begun to address these challenges. For example, it is becom­
ing increasingly common to use devices that track continuous (eye, hand, or mouse) 
movements during screen-based choice tasks, for example, to explore how decision 
and action processes influence each other (Barca & Pezzulo, 2015; Burk et  al., 
2014; Cos et al., 2021; Marcos et al., 2015; Michalski et al., 2020; Resulaj et al., 
2009; Spivey, 2007; Spivey et al., 2005; Spivey & Dale, 2006). Figure 15.1 illus­
trates the richness of (finger) movement kinematics that an example participant 
executes while solving a spatial navigation task. The task is similar to the traveling 
salesman problem and requires finding a path that starts from the yellow dot and 
passes through all the red dots, without crossing any node twice (Eluchans et al., in 
preparation). The nine panels of Fig. 15.1 show the time course of the finger kine­
matics (in blue) and of the selected path (highlighted in gray) as a single participant 
solved a sample problem. The density of the blue circles that form the finger

trajectory illustrates the finger velocity, with greater density indicating slower finger 
movements. Initially, the participant moves fast to the left (Fig. 15.1a) and then 
down, before pausing (Fig. 15.1b). Afterward, she continues to move down and 
starts moving right (Fig. 15.1c); but before completing the right movement, she 
“changes her mind” and moves down instead (Fig. 15.1d). After briefly moving to 
the right (Fig.  15.1e), she backtracks and undoes a large portion of the path 
(Fig. 15.1f). The last three panels of Figure 1 show how, afterward, she finds a path 
that solves the problem. This example illustrates that tracking movements during a

cognitive task (here, spatial problem-solving) provides rich kinematic data, such as 
movement direction and velocity, pauses, and changes of direction. These in turn 
can shed light on the dynamics of cognitive processes, such as the plan under con­
sideration and its associated confidence, choice uncertainty, and changes of mind.
Furthermore, there is a recent trend of studying more naturalistic settings in sys­
tems neuroscience, for example, with neural recordings in freely moving animals 
(Chestek et al., 2009; Schwarz et al., 2014; Sodagar et al., 2007) or during naviga­
tion in controlled environments (Etienne et al., 2014; Krumin et al., 2018). Notably, 
some recent studies have found good ways to overcome some of the methodological 
challenges that arise when recording human neural activity during ecological situa­
tions, such as the presence of noise generated by movements. For example, recent 
technical innovations have made it possible to record neural activity while humans 
walk with a portable iEEG system in their backpacks (Aghajan et  al., 2017; 
Topalovic et al., 2020). New noninvasive recording systems are also becoming more 
popular, including new MEG sensors (SQUID) that can be directly attached on the 
scalp and produce less movement-related artifacts (Boto et al., 2018). Finally, stud­
ies using a combination of electroencephalography and virtual reality provide 
unprecedented ways to study how humans process affordances in ecological set­
tings (Djebbara et al., 2019, 2021).
However, many interesting facets of embodied decisions still remain unad­
dressed, partly due to conceptual and methodological difficulties. Perhaps the most 
fundamental methodological challenge is the formalization, measurement, and 
experimental manipulation of affordance-related choice dimensions, such as the 
overtakeability for car drivers, passability of balls for basketball or soccer players, 
or jumpability for river crossers who must navigate from stone to stone. These 
choice dimensions reflect geometric, physical, and embodied aspects of the situa­
tion, such as, for the example of crossing a river, the distances between stones, the 
size and abilities of the person, and the surface attributes of the landing sites. It is 
often unclear how to select, define, and factor these dimensions in a decision model.
We will illustrate a generic methodology to formalize embodied choice settings 
in the lab, in terms of an expected value surface, which is analogous to the key 
notion of expected value in neuroeconomic studies; see Gordon et al. (2021) for a 
more detailed treatment. In neuroeconomics, expected value is defined as the math­
ematical expectation of the utility (U), treated as a random variable across all pos­
sible outcomes: no

. By projecting this definition onto a 
physical 2D space where i indexes all possible locations—what we call the expected 
value surface—we combine these same two factors, probabilities and utilities, in a 
way that extends naturally to many embodied decision settings. Further, the compo­
nents of our expected value surface take on the new semantics of immediate affor­
dances (capturing present opportunities for movement) and future affordances 
(capturing the approximate downstream utility of occupying a particular location), 
respectively. Some of these ideas have been developed to address embodied deci­
sions in the wild, namely, for the analytics of sports like basketball (Cervone et al., 
2016) and soccer (Fernández et al., 2019). These studies can model a multiplicity of 
choice factors using a data-driven approach (e.g., recordings from hundreds or 
15  Studying Embodied Decisions in the Wild and in the Lab

thousands of games) that is not possible in lab studies. We show that it is, however, 
feasible to apply similar principles to smaller-scale studies in the lab, for which a 
simpler formal characterization is possible—as in the case of the crossing-the-river 
task that we discuss below.
15.3  An Annotated Example of Embodied Choice “in 
the Lab”: Crossing the River
Imagine a person who has to cross a river by jumping between stones of different 
sizes and placed at different spatial locations (see Fig. 15.2). Using the affordance 
landscape decomposition strategy mentioned above, and an intuitive physical 
knowledge of the dynamics of jumping to targets in a high-risk setting, we can 
model the problem as follows. Immediate affordances are composed of two sub­
components, one representing the jumper’s range given their present location 
(Fig. 15.2b) and the other representing the stones affording (dry) landability in the 
environment (Fig. 15.2c). In contrast, the utility landscape (Fig. 15.2d) must incor­
porate the goal-directedness of the task, which we approximate as a simple linear 
distance to the goal location (the opposite bank of the river).
Consistent with our mapping from the economic decision setting, we compute 
the expected value landscape as the product of probability and utility as shown in 
Fig. 15.2e. The resultant surface summarizes the best places in the environment to 
be, conditioned on the goal of crossing the river, and subject to the constraints of the 
embodied present. As can be readily seen, the small stone to the northeast provides 
the maximum expected value as it is near enough to jump to easily and affords for­
ward progress.
However, this example also highlights a problem. If our jumper perceives and 
acts on the expected value surface shown in Fig. 15.2e, they will find themselves in 
a dead end since all subsequent jumps fall on the peripheries of their range. This can 
be seen in the new immediate affordance landscapes after taking action right as 
shown in Fig. 15.3a. The solution, of course, lies in planning. To the extent that the 
affordance landscapes visualized in this example correspond to a dynamics model 
capturing the interactions of the individual and their environment, then this model 
can also be used to evaluate hypothetical multi-step action sequences (i.e., mental 
simulation or rollouts in the Reinforcement Learning literature). While simulation 
of a single step, e.g., A0 = right, results in an updated EV surface with low maximum 
value, A0 = left (a jump to the slightly less direct option to the left) results in a much 
better situation.
As is common in planning agents, we can model deliberation at each jump by 
generating multiple rollouts guided by a Monte Carlo (stochastic) trajectory sam­
pling algorithm which generates plausible trajectories through the expected value 
surface itself. As with REINFORCE (Sutton & Barto, 1998) or ATS (Maisto et al., 
2021), we can then update the action policy conditioned on the resultant discounted

Fig. 15.2  An example embodied decision. (a) While crossing a river, a child (whose position is 
indicated by the white triangle) has to decide which stones to jump to next. (b–f) The choice situ­
ation can be decomposed by considering the two fundamental dimensions of probability (capturing 
the roles of immediate affordances) and utility (capturing the roles of future affordances) of the 
choices, which can be combined to calculate an expected value surface—and which peaks at the 
best stone. In turn, the probability dimension can be further decomposed into a distance subcom­
ponent (that prioritizes closer stones) and a landability subcomponent (that prioritizes bigger 
stones), each of which can be quantified mathematically, based on considerations of the physical, 
geometric, and embodied characteristics of the setup (e.g., distance reflects the physical body-­
object distance that may be scaled by body size). Note that, in this example, the utility subcompo­
nent is naïve as it only prioritizes stones that are physically closer to the destination, without also 
considering whether they are closer or farther from other stones (see Fig. 15.2 for this additional 
constraint). See Gordon et al. (2021) for further details
expected value at each step along the trajectory. The result, as shown in Figs. 15.3b 
and c, is an updated value surface favoring the future-aware utility of the left stone, 
over the greedy immediate access to the right.
This toy example highlights the way we might model the simplest decision point 
during a navigation episode. One might further expand this example to consider 
additional dimensions that are usually studied in economic decision settings, such

Fig 15.3  Planning while crossing the river. (a) Expected value surface without planning and, 
below, the expected result for the actions left and right. (b–c) Expected value surfaces after one-­
step planning. The cost of computing these updates is a function of parameters specific to both the 
planner (e.g., learning rate, planning depth) and problem context (e.g., number and differentiation 
of offers available, branching factor, etc.). Here, we show two updated utility surfaces, calculated 
using two rollouts (b) or ten rollouts (c) of a Monte Carlo trajectory sampling algorithm. Note that 
these are cartoon examples, as the result depends on the choice of parameters such as learning rate
as the influence of decoys or intertemporal considerations in the choice process. 
Additionally, this case of crossing the river raises several other considerations that 
might constrain or influence the decision process of an agent performing the task. 
These include epistemic value and, more broadly, information-theoretic consider­
ations, which are often more nuanced in embodied settings like our example.
As pointed out by Rubin et al., information-theoretic measures and the circular 
nature of information flow between agent and environment are rarely considered in 
methods such as REINFORCE or ATS mentioned above—and, more broadly, in 
problems formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs) (Rubin et al., 2012). 
Studies in humans have shown that experts, in particular, effectively leverage infor­
mation embedded in environment-agent interaction (e.g., by taking epistemic 
actions) to reduce the complexity of a task and the cognitive resources required to 
solve it (Kirsh & Maglio, 1994). Furthermore, decision-makers often trade off the 
accuracy of a decision and its complexity, by selecting (for example) plans that are 
less effective or less accurate but simpler to form and follow, hence saving cognitive 
resources (Bhui et al., 2021; Zénon et al., 2019).
In our task, agents may exploit the structure of the environment to reduce the 
complexity of not only present but also future decisions. As shown in Fig. 15.4a, 
imagine an agent deciding between two paths across the river, one more direct path

Fig. 15.4  Examples of information-theoretic considerations studied in the context of the crossing-­
the-­river task. (a) In a configuration where some stones are slippery, the magenta path minimizes 
control costs by reducing the complexity of expected future decisions, despite its greater length. 
(b) The uncertainty inherent to the task (due to partial observability and the probabilistic nature of 
the affordance landscape) can result in scenarios where epistemic value must be considered. A visit 
to the stone prior to the uncertain jump (gray question mark) may reveal that it is passable, permit­
ting continuation on the optimal orange route, or impassable, requiring the agent to fall back on a 
detour to the less direct blue route
(blue) that passes through a field of slippery stones, which must be avoided, and a 
less direct path (magenta) that can be successfully navigated with a trivial control 
policy (e.g., “jump to the nearest stone that I haven’t already visited”). While the 
blue path minimizes jumps and distance, it depends on the deployment of either a 
continuing perceptual evaluation process (detect and avoid slippery stones) or the 
memorization of a safe route, which must be stored in working memory. In contrast, 
the magenta path enables the agent to offload these considerations, thus exploiting 
the information held in the environment.
Our cross-the-river task also enables the study of other behaviors inherent to real 
decisions in naturalistic settings such as contingency planning, in which down­
stream decisions must be considered in the context of multiple possible configura­
tions that have not yet been observed. Recent work has studied human navigation 
behavior in this context, finding that participants choose to sample information in 
proportion to the expected cost of an undesirable contingency (Ma et al., 2021). In 
Fig. 15.4b, we imagine a river configuration exhibiting uncertainty in passability

(and therefore in the true affordances available to the agent during crossing). Prior 
to entering the river, the feasibility of the jump on the right, highlighted by the gray 
bar, may be ambiguous. If passable, the orange route will minimize distance, but if 
not, the blue route is optimal. Owing to the partial observability inherent to embod­
ied decision settings, certainty about the critical jump is expected to evolve as the 
agent approaches, and by doing so, it obtains an improved estimate of the gap with 
respect to its own jump range. Some agents may prefer to pursue the rightmost route 
optimistically, knowing that a suitable alternative is available (the middle stones 
connecting to the blue path) contingent on discovering the uncertain jump is in fact 
too far. Crucially, to the extent that (as shown before) we are able to mathematically 
characterize the decision variables, such as present and future affordances, we are 
also able to provide a rigorous formal account of different strategies (e.g., optimistic 
strategies or those that minimize control costs) and compare them with human 
behavior. As these examples illustrate, embodied decision tasks provide a rich set­
ting to study both classical economic decisions and embodied and situated aspects 
of decision-making that are rarely considered but fundamental to understanding 
how we make ecologically valid  choices. The development of novel formal 
approaches to study embodied decisions might pave the way to the development of 
novel research programs that address more directly how we continuously select, 
exploit, and create present and future affordances (Gordon et al., 2021).
15.4  Conclusion
We began by noting that research on decision-making (e.g., in psychology and neu­
roeconomics) has historically focused on classical economic settings where partici­
pants weigh the monetary value of a limited number of offers. We noted that human 
evolutionary history was certainly dominated by a far more complex class of deci­
sions, in which movement plays a driving role, and offers change dynamically 
through a temporally extended process. Despite challenges in studying these more 
naturalistic embodied decision settings, novel methods are already being explored 
enabling studies both in the wild (e.g., during soccer or basketball games or during 
animal foraging) and in the lab (e.g., in reduced laboratory versions of the above 
settings that expose similar embodied choice dynamics). We presented a general 
framework to study the construction of expected value landscapes by mapping the 
classical notions of probability and utility as immediate and future affordances. We 
then illustrated this method with the case of crossing the river and highlighted some 
of the planning-based and information-theoretic considerations it allows us to rea­
son about. We believe studies and models of this nature may help advance research 
into decision-making by bringing insights from the more naturalistic sensorimotor 
problems we are confronted with every day.

Toward Human Augmentation Using 
Neural Fingerprints of Affordances

16.1  Introduction
To describe the inseparable connection of action and perception, Gibson introduced 
the term affordance in his 1979 seminal work on the ecological approach to percep­
tion (Gibson, 2014). According to Gibson, affordances are possibilities for action 
that a given environment, object, or interactive technology offers a person or user. 
In other words, what actions can we perform with the things surrounding us. For 
example, a chair affords sitting on or a door handle affords grasping and pushing 
it down.
The application of the affordance concept is a key topic in usability and user 
experience design. Objects and interfaces are well-designed when they “suggest 
how to be used” (Gibson, 2014). Don Norman picked up this definition of affor­
dances in The Design of Everyday Things (Norman, 2013), complementing the 
basic psychological research of Gibson with practical application. By re-framing 
affordances from a designer’s viewpoint, Norman motivated designers to imple­
ment Gibson’s theories and put the objective to design for easily perceived utility at 
the core of his definition of user-centered design.
Placing the user at the center of the design process requires a thorough consider­
ation of the user’s physical constitution. The emphasis on the holistic physical con­
stitution has been apparent in contemporary extension of Gibson’s original definition 
of affordance. Clark defined affordances as “the possibilities for use, intervention, 
and action which the physical world offers a given agent and are determined by the

‘fit’ between the agent’s physical structure, capacities, and skills and the action-­
related properties of the environment itself” (Clark, 1999). In this view, affordance 
emerges in the interplay between object and user. For example, through visual, hap­
tic, and proprioceptive relations between a cup and the user emerges the affordance 
of grasping and picking it up. Another example is that of a child and a children’s 
chair, where the affordance of sitting emerges while the same small chair might not 
afford an adult person to sit on it. Chemero (2018) has argued that affordances are 
in fact best defined as such relations emerging in interactions (Chemero, 2018).
Crucially then, designers should consider all communication channels that allow 
a user to interact with the designed artifact. By communication channels, we refer 
to all sensory modalities in which the user has a relation with the object they want 
to interact with.
16.1.1  Interfacing Affordances for Human Augmentation
In our increasingly complex world, many objects in our environment do not readily 
afford their intended use case. For example, we frequently find objects to require 
multi-step interaction, such as a spray can that needs to be shaken before use (Lopes 
et al., 2015). Today, the challenge is to design such a shake-before-use affordance. 
But how can we establish a relation that communicates this dynamic use?
Frequently, the intended behavioral changes or dynamic uses of objects are com­
municated through instruction manuals or displays on the object itself, for example, 
a red sign on a door when locked. However, the affordance to grasp the door handle 
would still emerge as the handle remains visible, decreasing the interaction effi­
ciency. To avoid this, consider a smart shape-changing door. Economidou and 
Hengeveld (2021) demonstrated a shape-changing door prototype using actuators 
and laser-cut polygonal wood elements, elegantly bridging the digital to the physi­
cal environment. To cue entry prohibition, the door changed its shaped and con­
cealed its panel. Hence, their prototype attenuated the emergence of a 
grasp-door-handle affordance by altering the perception-action relations between 
the physical object and the user.
But animating smart physical objects comes at a cost, such as a high engineering/
construction effort with significant hardware costs. Due to the hardware’s constant 
configuration changes during operation, the high cost is also represented in energy 
consumption. Further, changing a user’s environment may be a surprising experi­
ence impacting interaction efficiency (Follmer et al., 2013). With inFORM, Follmer 
et al. (2013) explored a shape-changing display and found that “rapid shape transi­
tions were jarring to users” (Follmer et al., 2013), concluding that caution must be 
taken in the design of transitions to not confuse users.
As an alternative route, designers may choose to impinge (an affordance) on the 
user more immediately. This would be possible by inducing an action in the user 
that indicates the required interaction with the object. Such an approach requires the 
use of a haptic device with sufficient force to induce movements in the user. The

most traditional way to achieve this is by pushing the user’s body or parts of the 
body with a mechanical force. To this end, motor-based haptic systems like exoskel­
etons and mechanical devices with sensors and actuators that are placed on the 
users’ body to support and augment movements can be used (e.g., Sandoval-­
Gonzalez et al., 2016). However, these devices tend to be large and cumbersome and 
as such tend to find more applications in factory settings than in everyday situations 
(Nith et al., 2021). To circumvent this size limitation of existing motor-based haptic 
devices, researchers have turned to electrically stimulating the user’s muscles with 
a small and safe current applied via electrodes attached to the user’s skin (Lopes & 
Baudisch, 2013; Tamaki et al., 2011). For instance, in Affordance++, Lopes et al. 
(2015) used electric muscle stimulation (EMS) on the user’s forearm to communi­
cate the multi-step process such as shaking a spray can before using it. When users 
picked up the can, muscles on the forearm were electrically stimulated to trigger a 
shaking movement in the wrist, indicating the dynamic use of shaking the can 
before spraying. Instead of augmenting the object, Lopes et al. (2015) augmented 
the user, arguing that “While animating objects allows implementing object behav­
ior, we argue affordance is about implementing user behavior” (Lopes et al., 2015).
However, these approaches are still simplistic in that they assume the user’s men­
tal state and physical predispositions are static—in fact, these approaches currently 
assume the user is ready to receive the physical assistance at any time and will not 
ever be disrupted by it: an unrealistic assumption. With respect to the above exam­
ple of shaking the spray can, once the shake-can-before-use affordance emerged, 
the muscle stimulation is redundant. If the users pick up the can a second time, they 
know that the can affords shaking before spraying. However, the can is not aware of 
what’s going on in the user’s mind and thus cannot adapt to a user who learned that 
the can should be shook before use when picking it up again.
But how can the system be made aware of the user’s understanding of the object? 
How can it be informed about the user’s side of the affordance, the user’s “[...] 
physical structure, capacities, and skills [...]” (Clark, 1999)? Or in more general 
terms, how can a system be made aware of the users’ current action plan?
We propose that more information on the user’s current state is needed to fully 
realize the potential of these new types of affordances. We instantiate this by mea­
suring the electrical activity of the user’s brain through the electroencephalogram 
(EEG) to establish a direct communication channel between the users’ brain and the 
“smart” computing layer of the objects in their environment. In our research, we aim 
at elucidating how to leverage the user’s mental state(s) to moderate the emergence 
of affordances through actuating hardware such as exoskeletons or EMS. We believe 
the simultaneous use of brain measurements and physical actuation of the user’s 
body allows to test whether implementing affordances is possible. This approach 
holds particular promise for physically challenged users as well as going beyond the 
human bodies’ physical limitations.
16  Toward Human Augmentation Using Neural Fingerprints of Affordances

16.1.2  Related Work
For our proposal to work, brain activity must carry information in terms of affor­
dances. Following Gibson’s ecological psychology, affordances are the direct per­
ception of action possibilities. The key idea is that perception and action are 
inseparable.
Such an inseparable relation between action and perception is reflected in the 
organization of the primate brain that reveals a close interaction of cortical struc­
tures underlying visual information processing and motor control (Gallese et al., 
1996). Different processing streams in the human brain subserve the processing of 
semantic perceptual object information in the ventral stream and object-directed 
action information in the dorsal stream (Mishkin et al., 1983). Faster processing of 
incoming visual information in the dorsal stream allows for quick relaying of action-­
relevant information to the premotor and motor cortices for the selection of ade­
quate action programs (Nowak & Bullier, 1997).
As a consequence, passively perceiving objects that afford interaction activates 
motor areas, which are also active when the interaction is executed. This has been 
demonstrated in a study showing participants’ images varying in their level of 
implied affordance, contrasting faces, animals, and houses with images of tools. 
Scanning the participants’ brain when looking at the images of tools revealed activ­
ity known to occur during the use of one’s hand (Chao & Martin, 2000). The 
observed brain areas reported in the study are related to the execution of a grasping 
or reaching movement as well as attributing such movements to the self. Hence, 
merely looking at the images of tools triggered a brain response similar to the actual 
use of the tools even though no action was possible as participants were instructed 
to lie still in the brain scanner.
Similar studies have shown that this brain activity decreases when affordances 
vanish. These studies typically manipulate (1) an object’s location and/or (2) an 
object’s visual features. The manipulation of the object’s location means placing it 
either in peripersonal space where one could grab it or in extrapersonal space where 
one cannot. On the other hand, the visual features are altered from familiar forms, 
such as a cup, to distorted unfamiliar variants. It is frequently reported that brain 
activity congruent to the physical grasping action is also measurable when partici­
pants are merely looking at an expected graspable object in peripersonal space. 
Importantly, this brain activity pattern disappears with changes in form or distance 
(Wamain et al., 2016). Wamain et al. (2016) found the μ rhythm of EEG activity, an 
oscillation around 10 Hz that originates in motor areas, to diminish gradually as an 
object was moved from peripersonal to extrapersonal space. Importantly, this was 
only observed for objects with a familiar form. As it appears, the fast communica­
tion between visual areas and motor regions allows for affordances to influence 
action-related brain activity.
Hence, the brain activity underlying this perception-action is moderated by the fit 
between us and our environment, as described in Clark’s definition of affordances. 
Crucially, the communication between perception and action-relevant brain

structures is bidirectional, and activity in early sensory pathways is also moderated 
by the afforded interactions and the intentions of the user (Goslin et al., 2012). 
Planned actions can tune the neural populations underlying visual (and potentially 
also of other senses) perception of the environment (Job et al., 2017), again indicat­
ing an inseparable perception-action relationship.
Given this tight action-perception coupling and the accompanying brain activity, 
the neural representation of affordance can be measured using neurophysiological 
methods. This does not necessarily imply that the recorded activity reflects affor­
dance in absolute terms, but rather affordance as embedded in the user’s mental 
model of the potential interaction with an object. For example, it could be that an 
object affords several actions, like the spray can that affords shaking as well as 
pushing the button to spray. Thus, the push-button-to-spray affordance might be the 
dominating affordance, while shaking-can-before-use is not. However, the user has 
the knowledge to shake the can, but this might have been masked by the push-­
button-­to-spray affordance as the latter is more closely related to the action goal 
(e.g., painting a surface).
16.2  A System for Human Augmentation: Leveraging EEG 
and Physical Actuators
We imagine an interactive system consisting of two components: (1) the measure­
ment of human brain activity by means of EEG and other physiological sensors, for 
example, electromyography (EMG) to capture neuromotor activity, and (2) a haptic 
device capable of moving the user’s body, for example, the aforementioned exoskel­
etons or EMS; see Fig. 16.1.
We investigate how EEG and EMG can be used to infer whether an affordance 
emerges and the user intends to act or not. Subsequently, through physical actuation 
of the user’s body, for example, lifting a finger to cue a reaching movement, the 
system can manipulate affordance, either motivating or discouraging an upcom­
ing action.
This hinges on a fast capture of information originating from the perception-­
action coupling in the brain. Djebbara et al. (2019) have captured “neural finger­
prints of affordances” already 200 ms after the onset of a visual stimulus. In their 
work, participants were placed in VR scenes with three differently sized doors, 
some of them were designed to afford passage, while others were not. EEG capture 
of motor-related brain activity differed when participants saw a door they were 
physically able to pass as compared to a door that was too narrow to fit through. 
This very early response would allow human action augmentation, i.e., to initiate or 
inhibit motor execution already after 200 ms, discouraging walking toward the door 
by, for example, gait manipulation.

parable setup. (b) Relaxed hand/finger position preceding an afforded tapping interaction. (c) We 
propose a system that actuates the user’s forearm muscles by detecting the user’s mental state, such

the forearm muscles are activated through EMS, the user’s hand and finger are lifted, and the tap­
ping affordance is communicated
16.2.1  Implications: Extending Affordances
For illustration purposes, we discuss the application of such a human-machine sys­
tem on the two sides of the affordance relation—the object side and the user side.
First, extending “the possibilities for use, intervention, and action with the physi­
cal world” (Clark, 1999) focuses more on the object side. Following Lopes et al. 
(2015), the system can indicate affordances that are not readily available by actuat­
ing the user’s physical structure, as in the example of shaking the spray can. If the 
system detects brain activity corresponding to a grasp affordance, it can check in 
with the current state of the spray can (push vs. shake necessary). If perceived affor­
dance and current state of the can do not align, the actuating hardware can step into 
the interaction to adapt it. This is especially promising considering the ubiquitous 
Internet of Things (IoT), where smart objects are in constant connection with the 
user and their environment. IoT objects are frequently equipped with many sensors 
that enable them to adapt their behavior to the user’s state. Assuming these objects 
have access to the user’s mental states (e.g., through EEG measurements), the 
required action by the object and the action intended by the user can be inspected 
for alignment. In the case of detected discrepancies, the actuating hardware can 
impinge the interaction behavior of the user toward the required action, for example, 
discouraging the user to shake the spray can in case it is empty by applying force

179
against the shaking movement. This illustrates the neuroadaptive capacities in case 
of multiple-use options where rigid mental models attenuate existing alternatives 
for use that are not easily perceived by the user. Second, moderating “...the ‘fit’ 
between the agent’s physical structure, capacities, and skills and the action-related 
properties of the environment itself” focuses on the user side. Here, one interesting 
implication is whether affordances can be extended using such a proposed augmen­
tation system. Consider a heavy stone lying somewhere in the user’s peripersonal 
space. While it is in distance where they could pick it up, and its shape would allow 
holding it, its appearance indicates that it is likely too heavy to do so. Monitoring 
the user’s brain activity will indicate that no fingerprint of the affordance to pick up 
the stone is present. However, through the help of an exoskeleton, it could indeed be 
possible for the augmented user to lift the said stone. The system, through monitor­
ing the user’s muscle activity, has access to the user’s physical capabilities. By mod­
eling the day-to-day arm lifting activities, the system learns the limits of the user’s 
arm strength. Then, when an object’s weight, like the stones, supersedes the user’s 
arm strength, the system may nudge the user’s arms to try and lift the stone and 
assist the user in lifting it. Over time the affordance may be extended with the sys­
tem being able to constantly check whether changes in the brain activity reflect an 
affordance fingerprint. While enabling such superhuman capacities is an interesting 
research direction, application in settings where precise motor control is required, 
such as during creative expression (Scott & Gehrke, 2019), promises similar returns.
16.3  Conclusion
We proposed the idea to leverage EEG in conjunction with force-feedback haptic 
devices to allow objects in our surroundings to exhibit dynamic affordances. In 
other words, not only users can be instrumented (with a haptic device, such as a 
force-feedback or exoskeleton device) to learn how to best manipulate an object 
they encounter, but the user can also be instrumented with a sensing device (such as 
EEG) that allows the interactive system to fine-tune the affordance according to the 
user’s mental state. Such a system critically depends on the fast measurement of 
brain activity to cue, moderate, and control a user’s body movement via actuation 
hardware in near real time. With our closing thoughts, we hope to stimulate a debate 
about the design of systems for physically augmented humans.

A Husserlian Approach to Affectivity 
and Temporality in Affordance Perception
Juan Diego Bogotá and Giuseppe Flavio Artese
17.1  Introduction
Famously, J. J. Gibson (1977/2017) coined the term affordance to refer to the action 
possibilities offered to a given animal by the environment. However, he also claimed 
that, even if affordances are always perceived from the perspective of individual 
animals, their existence is fully independent of those who perceive them. The rejec­
tion of the idea that affordances are animal-dependent comes from Gibson’s dis­
satisfaction towards the subjective-objective dichotomies present in the psychological 
theories of his time—theories that still today play a central role in the cognitive 
sciences. In contrast, the concept of affordance was supposed to cut across all pos­
sible forms of dualism and, as we understand it, be the starting point for a new 
relational ontology. However, the characterization of the notion of affordance has 
been often found obscure and has generated some confusion even among the most 
enthusiastic ecological psychologists. As a matter of fact, despite the anti-Cartesian 
and non-dualistic tendencies shared among all Gibsonian scholars, the ontological 
debate behind the same notion of affordance includes several proposals. It has been 
discussed whether affordances should be better defined as environmental resources 
(Reed, 1996), as dispositional properties (Turvey, 1992), or as relations between 
abilities of the animal and aspects of the situation (Chemero, 2003, 2009). In this 
paper, we are not aiming to provide either a fine-grained taxonomy of the different 
proposals (however, see Rucińska, 2020) or an extensive discussion of the points of

strength and weakness of each individual ontological stance. What seems problem­
atic is that, on the one hand, if affordances are thought of as nothing but physical 
properties, it is unclear in which sense they must be understood in reference to a 
certain animal. On the other hand, if affordances are to be understood in reference 
to an animal, it is unclear in which sense they are not animal-dependent. These 
ambiguities have led some neo-Gibsonians to think of affordances as latent proper­
ties existing independently of individual organisms or whole species (e.g. Fultot 
et al., 2016; Heras-Escribano, 2019). However, as Di Paolo noticed, assuming a 
God’s eye view and claiming that affordances can exist even if there would be no 
extant species is something that can be claimed only hindsight and represents a 
dramatic universal disembodied statement (Di Paolo, 2016). Reasonably, this same 
assumption seems to contradict Gibson’s idea of an irreducible mutuality between 
organisms and environment.
As most 4E theorists, we recognize the value of the notion of affordance. 
However, in this paper, we aim to provide a phenomenological characterization of 
the perceiver’s role in affordance perception. We believe that such a phenomeno­
logical approach is pivotal for the understanding of affordances. More precisely, we 
argue that proper phenomenological descriptions can provide important insights 
into how perceivers participate and contribute to the emergence of affordances. 
What is distinctive of the phenomenological tradition is the interest in the essential 
a priori structures and structural invariants of experience. If affordances are under­
stood as phenomena that cut across “the dichotomy between subjectivity and objec­
tivity”, it spontaneously follows that their existence depends on environmental 
features as much as on the active role of situated subjects whose experience can be 
described phenomenologically.1 If our proposal is right, and thus phenomenological 
analyses can enrich our understanding of affordance perception, particular attention 
is to be paid to the affective and temporal characteristics of the phenomenology of 
experiencing an affordance. More specifically, we look at these phenomena as char­
acterized in the work of Edmund Husserl. While the claim that phenomenological 
investigations can contribute to our understanding of the nature of affordances is 
something that has been discussed in the past (see Käufer & Chemero, 2021; Dings, 
1 It should be acknowledged that there might be some tension between phenomenology and eco­
logical psychology insofar as the former (especially in its Husserlian version) is explicitly anti-
naturalist, whereas the latter “rejects the causal reductionism of other scientific psychologies but 
without rejecting their emphasis on experiment and empirical explanation” (Reed, 1996, p. 19). It 
would go beyond the scope of this paper to delve into Husserl’s anti-naturalism and the possibility 
of integrating phenomenology and ecological psychology. Suffice it to say that, from a Husserlian 
standpoint, consciousness should be seen as a condition for the natural world to appear, and thus, 
it would be a category mistake to study consciousness from the perspective of the natural sciences 
for they assume that the objects they study are in the natural world. We believe, however, that a 
non-objectivist scientific approach to the mind (such as ecological psychology) and/or a re-con­
ceptualization of the idea of nature could be consistent with phenomenology’s anti-naturalism. For 
a brief suggestion on how ecological psychology and Husserlian phenomenology could be inte­
grated, see Roy et al. (1999, pp. 68–71). For more on the idea of re-thinking the concept of nature 
and thus opening the possibility of integrating a new kind of naturalism and phenomenology, see 
Vörös (2014) and Gallagher (2018).

2018), to our knowledge, the phenomenological aspects of temporality and affectiv­
ity have been so far largely unexplored by affordance theorists.2 Importantly, in the 
current work, we sympathize with the relational approach developed by Chemero 
(2009). By considering affordances as emergent relations in which both the animal 
and its surroundings are constitutively necessary for the existence of affordances, 
his approach can fully embrace the considerations made by Husserl in which phe­
nomena such as temporality and affectivity are necessary for the phenomenological 
appearance of the functional character of everyday objects. We are also aware that 
our proposal represents a departure from Gibson’s original ideas in which ecologi­
cal information is exclusively contained in the environment as something that “need 
only to be attended to” (Gibson, 1972, p. 79). Our considerations instead resonate 
with the notion of ecological information as developed by van Dijk et al. (2015). 
The notion of information here discussed, that the authors define as information-­
how, is not independent of its usage, and it is maintained through the activities of a 
community of agents through their histories of interaction.
17.2  Affordances: Beyond Objectivity and Subjectivity
The experience of a climber who is in front of a climbing wall can, without hesita­
tion, be used as an example to elucidate the value that phenomenological analyses 
can play regarding affordance perception.
As anyone who has gone to an indoor climbing centre knows, a climbing wall 
has several holds that have different shapes, sizes, and textures. For a climber, such 
holds appear, to a greater or lesser extent, as graspable—they afford being grasped. 
For instance, whereas a curvy-shaped hold that has a pocket in which the climber’s 
hand could fit appears as graspable, a sharp-edged and smooth hold may appear less 
so (Fig. 17.1). In other words, the holds are perceived as graspable, and this is pos­
sible exactly in virtue of the relation between a subject and a specific object.
While most orthodox ecological psychologists would simply claim that the hold 
is perceived as graspable because it matches a bodily disposition of the perceiver 
(Turvey, 1992), we suggest that there is much more to be learnt if the experience of 
graspability is phenomenologically analysed. In the first place, through phenome­
nological descriptions, it is possible to further emphasize how the affordance of 
grasping is fully inherent to the perception of the hold. The perceptual meaning of 
the hold is in part constituted by what it affords. The hold is perceived as affording 
the action of grasping as part of its perceptual meaning. Importantly, affordances 
are, in a very specific sense, irreducible and genuinely given in pre-reflective experi­
ence. The climber does not have to think about whether a hold is graspable or not; 
2 To be sure, affection and temporality are not the only phenomenological characteristics that 
underpin affordance perception. One should also acknowledge, among other things, the experience 
of one’s own embodiment, the sedimentation of habits or attunement towards daily sociocultural 
practices. However, we will focus on affection and temporality alone.

Fig. 17.1  Climbing holds. The left-side hold, as it has a shape in which a person’s hand naturally 
fits, may appear as graspable. The right-side hold, because of its shape and texture, may appear as 
less graspable than the left-side hold
it just appears as so. Thus, to better understand the role that the subject plays, it is 
important to look into the phenomenology of affordance perception.3
It could be objected that our phenomenological emphasis might lead to thinking 
of affordances as completely subject-dependent. For instance, Heras-Escribano has 
claimed that “the main problem of the phenomenological approach is that it focuses 
on subjectivity; hence, phenomenologists endorse the subjective-objective dichot­
omy that is inconsistent with the ecological approach and the nature of affordances” 
(2019, p. 105). However, it is important to emphasize that, from a phenomenologi­
cal characterization, it does not follow that action possibilities are just a mere pro­
jection or a private affair of the perceivers. Phenomenology, as a philosophical 
method, is not aimed at grasping a private and inaccessible mental domain in which 
the subject is trapped inside. The phenomenological method is instead concerned 
with the rigorous study of the invariants that are essential to different experiences. 
Therefore, a phenomenological analysis of affordance perception does not aim to 
disclose a private mental domain, but a set of structures that are essential to such a 
kind of experience. It follows that the emphasis on first-person analyses that 
3 The relevance of a phenomenological analysis of affordance perception has already been pointed 
out by Dreyfus and Kelly (2007), as well as other authors inspired by them. However, most (if not 
all) those phenomenological approaches to affordance perception have usually drawn to Merleau-
Pontian phenomenology, rather than from Husserlian phenomenology as we do.

characterizes phenomenological investigations can be seen as a valid complementa­
tion to ecological descriptions. Furthermore, phenomenologists would agree with 
Gibson in claiming that affordances are both objective and subjective. They are 
objective in the sense that they are aspects and features of the objects perceived in 
the world. However, they are also subjective in the sense that they only make sense 
as appearing from the perspective of an animal. Thus, from our phenomenological 
standpoint, Gibson’s words are confirmed: “an affordance is neither an objective 
property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like” (1979/2015, p. 121, 
emphasis added).
At this point, a Gibsonian may object that by suggesting that, from a phenome­
nological perspective, affordances can be understood as both subjective and objec­
tive, we are ignoring the fact that the theory of affordances is meant to show the 
inadequacy of the subjective-objective dichotomy. For instance, Gibson claims that 
“the absolute duality of ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ is false. When we consider the 
affordances of things, we escape this philosophical dichotomy” (1979/2015, p. 35). 
In a word, affordances point towards the unity of the organism-environment system 
and not towards a distinction between a subjective organism and an objective envi­
ronment. Therefore, it would be a mistake to describe an affordance as either sub­
jective or objective as we have done. However, we believe that our phenomenological 
approach does not subscribe to a traditional dichotomy between subject and object. 
By arguing that affordances are both subjective and objective, we claim that an 
absolute duality (as Gibson calls it) between those two poles is untenable. Moreover, 
a phenomenological analysis like ours is well-fitted to address the experiential 
dimension of affordance perception without dividing the so-called organism-­
environment system. As phenomenologists often suggest, a careful analysis of 
experience reveals an essential correlation between consciousness and world.4 The 
phenomenology of affordance perception is a great example of how subjectivity and 
objectivity are always correlated. Our proposal consists precisely in claiming that, 
phenomenologically, this dual—or perhaps ambiguous—nature of affordances can 
be appreciated by analysing the affective and temporal characteristics of affordance 
perception. We now turn to them.
4 Our phenomenological approach to affordance perception needs thus to be differentiated from the 
idea that perceivers project or construct a subjectiveenvironment. Instead, we think of agents as 
actively disclosing their meaningful surroundings. This difference can be furtherly highlighted by 
comparing ourproposal with the contemporary approaches in biosemiotics that stemmed from the 
work of Jakob von Uexküll. For him, as much as for his followers (e.g. Kull etal., 2011), agents, 
through the receptors of their physiological apparatuses, literally create their niches. As von 
Uexküll puts it, “So in the nervous system thestimulus itself does not really appear but its place is 
taken by an entirely different process which has nothing to do with events in the outside world. [...] 
Thestimuli of the outside world are altogether translated into a nervous sign language” (1909/1996, 
p. 33). As it should be clear at this point, we reject thisconstructivist view in favour of a relational 
approach to affordances.

17.3  Affection and Temporality as Preconditions 
for Affordance Perception
As the climber is standing in front of the climbing wall, some of the holds appear 
more inviting than others. Indeed, depending on its shape and texture, the distances 
between it and the climber, and even the climber’s skill and embodiment, a hold 
may seem somewhat more (or somewhat less) alluring in contrast to other holds. 
This allure is what Husserl calls affection:
By affection we understand allure given to consciousness, the peculiar pull that an object 
given to consciousness exercises on the ego; it is a pull that is relaxed when the ego turns 
toward it attentively, and progresses from here, striving toward self-giving intuition, dis­
closing more and more of the self of the object, thus, striving toward an acquisition of 
knowledge, toward a more precise view of the object. (2001, p. 196)
Importantly, an object does not affect in isolation. It always affects from within a 
background. Think about a red dot in the middle of a white canvas. The red dot is 
alluring because of the stark contrast between it and the white background. If, 
instead of being on a white canvas, the red dot was in the middle of one of Pollock’s 
artworks, it would not be as salient precisely because of a lack of strong contrast.
Husserl limits his analyses of affection to the purely sensory domain, but it can 
be smoothly extended to world-involving and meaningful activities.5 From the per­
spective of the climber, all the holds in the climbing wall are affective to a lesser or 
a greater extent, but some of them are more alluring precisely because of the con­
trast of how grabbable they appear. So, for instance, if the two holds that appear in 
Fig. 17.1 were right beside one another roughly at the same distance from the climb­
er’s location, the curvy-shaped hold would probably appear to the climber as more 
alluring than the sharp-edged one. Importantly, based on the situation, the inviting 
character of the two holds can drastically vary in such a way that one can prevail 
over the other. Thus, one might say that one hold has more affective power than the 
other one.
What does it mean to say that an object is alluring (i.e. affective)? For Husserl, it 
simply means that it draws the attention of the subject (in the case of the example, 
the climber). However, it is possible to highlight that there are different ways in 
which an object may draw one’s attention. For instance, the red dot in the middle of 
the red canvas draws attention by motivating the observer to look at it. In contrast, 
the curvy-shaped hold draws attention by motivating the climber to grasp it. Notably, 
both ways of drawing a subject’s attention involve an affordance: the red dot is look­
able and the hold is graspable. In general, objects draw our attention by motivating

(2004) and Lambie (2020), among others.

us to practically engage with them in different ways.6 Therefore, affection is 
affordance-­related, and meaningful affordances are affective.7
What is interesting about the affective nature of affordances is that, from a phe­
nomenological perspective, affection is a felt pull coming from what is affecting the 
agent. It is not something that can be understood as an intracranial phenomenon or 
something that the subject projects onto the environment. Rather, affection is expe­
rienced as a centripetal force—assuming the subject as a metaphorical centre of 
curvature—in between the affected subject and the affecting object that can only 
arise given the physical properties of the latter and its surroundings and the fact of 
there being a subject who can interact with the affecting object. Indeed, the red dot 
affects the way it does partly because of its colour and the contrast between it and 
the white background. The curvy-shaped hold affects the way it does partly because 
of its shape and because of the contrast with other surrounding holds. In other 
words, part of the affective nature of affordances must be understood in reference to 
the physical properties of the objects and their surroundings. Thus, there is some­
thing irreducibly objective (in the sense of, object-dependent) about the phenome­
nology of affordances.
Affordances, however, are not entirely objective in the sense just described. As 
mentioned, their affective nature is in between what is objective and subjective. 
From the side of the perceiver, a crucial role for an affordance to emerge and be 
detected as meaningful is related to the temporal dynamics intrinsic to experience. 
Briefly, Husserl (1991) described the experience of time as constituted by three 
intertwined intentions: retention, primal impression, and protention. Put simply, at 
any given moment, one is not only aware via primal impression of what is happen­
ing in the current instant, but one is also pre-reflectively aware of what just hap­
pened via retention and what is about to happen via protention. At any given 
moment, one is simultaneously conscious of the just-past, the immediate present, 
and the near future. In other words, one does not have an experience of a “knife-­
edge” present but of a “duration block” which Husserl dubs the living present.8 
6 This can be related to Dreyfus and Kelly (2007), who anticipated that, when manifesting, affor­
dances are perceived as solicitations. We suggest that, while more than one affordance can have an 
inviting character, the subject will tend towards one specific action possibility depending on their 
affective force.
7 Here affectivity is understood in relation to the possibility of being affected, i.e. to be allured or to 
undergo a stimulus (“Reiz” in German). This sense of affectivity might seem very different from 
the one related to affective states such as emotions or moods. We believe, however, that both senses 
are intrinsically related. For instance, something disgusting may draw one’s attention because of 
how disgusting it is. Furthermore, Husserl (2006, Nrs. 69–75) himself suggests that affection may 
be defined by feelings of pleasure or displeasure (lust and unlust) that motivate the ego to react in 
different ways. In a few words, both senses of affectivity are connected by the idea that something 
can only affect if there is a lack of indifference towards it (Colombetti, 2014). A full-fledged phe­
nomenological analysis of affordances would have to say much more about the affective nature of 
affordances.
8 There are several subtle and complex relations between retention, primal impression, and proten­
tion which constitute the living present. It is, however, impossible to develop this topic further in 
this paper. See Husserl (1991, 2001).
17  A Husserlian Approach to Affectivity and Temporality in Affordance Perception

188
What is relevant about the structure of time consciousness is that one is always 
aware of the near future. There are several ways in which protention constitutes 
one’s experience of the world. For instance, while listening to a melody, even for the 
first time, one already pre-reflectively anticipates vague ways in which it might 
continue. Or, for a more relevant example, when the climber sees the climbing wall 
in front of her, she already pre-reflectively anticipates vague ways in which certain 
holds can be efficiently grabbed. In other words, the hold affords grasping because 
it is experienced as being potentially grabbed in the future. It is not only that the 
physical properties of the hold constitute part of its graspability but also the fact that 
the climber protends such grabbing. Such protention is like a centrifugal force that 
connects the embodied subject with the object. Without there being such anticipa­
tory dynamics within experience, affordances would not emerge from the perspec­
tive of the subject. What we want to emphasize here is that the conscious temporal 
dynamics that are intrinsic to every experience play a central role in our understand­
ing of how affordances are unfolded in the phenomenology of any individual agent.
Interestingly, it is under the correlation between the centrifugal and centripetal 
aspects of affordance perception that it becomes evident that affordances cannot be 
reduced to either purely objective or purely subjective properties. This fact becomes 
particularly salient in an example that is less artificial than that of wall climbing. 
Take the different experiences of a rock climber who goes to the same mountain at 
two different times of the year: summer and winter (Fig. 17.2). The two experiences 
are very different from one another insofar as different affordances appear for the 
Fig. 17.2  Rock climbing. The same environment may afford different action possibilities insofar 
as it is in constant flux. The same rock wall may affect a rock climber in a specific way during 
summer (left) which is very different from how it might affect him during winter (right)

rock climber. Indeed, even though in a sense the rock wall is the same in both expe­
riences, it affects in two radically different ways, entailing two radically different 
ways of anticipating possible paths for the rock climber. Thus, changes in the envi­
ronment entail changes in how the field of affordances is experienced. Correlatively, 
changes in the rock climber also entail changes in how she experiences the field of 
affordances. Perhaps she has climbed the same wall in the past; perhaps she just saw 
somebody else climbing the wall; or even, there might have been an increase in her 
muscular weight. These changes entail different anticipations, different affordances 
that become salient from the perspective of the rock climber. Thus, affordance per­
ception emerges from the interplay between how the environment affects the subject 
and how the subject anticipates possible ways of acting on the environment.
17.4  Conclusion
In this brief paper, we have emphasized how phenomenological analyses can sup­
port Gibson’s formulation of affordances as being simultaneously objective and 
subjective. We drew on Husserl’s analyses of affectivity and temporality to provide 
a more fine-grained understanding of the role of the subject in affordance percep­
tion. Our discussion seems to suggest that affordances involve both centripetal and 
centrifugal aspects. Affordances are centripetal because of the characteristics of the 
objects perceived that make it possible for an object to affect the subject. However, 
affordances are also centrifugal because of the protentional intention coming from 
the agent. Taken together, both the phenomena of temporality and affectivity show 
strong synergies with the notion of affordance as originally conceived.
Importantly, it will never be emphasized enough that, if not misconstrued as a 
mere form of introspection, phenomenological methods can provide an understand­
ing of subjectivity in line with Gibson’s strong commitment to anti-Cartesianism. 
From this phenomenological perspective, subjectivity is to be understood as a situ­
ated subjectivity that refers to a subject that is essentially related to the world, 
which, in turn, is essentially related to the subject. Thus, subjectivity, from a phe­
nomenological perspective, is not some kind of pure interiority that might project a 
phenomenal world from within, but rather it connotes the perspective of a subject 
that is within the world. On the one hand, pure ecological descriptions are extremely 
relevant to provide descriptions of an environment that is pragmatically meaningful 
for the subject. Despite the scepticism of most ecological psychologists towards 
first-person reports, we are convinced that the two traditions can be seen as comple­
mentary to each other.9

18.1  Introduction
The theme of this collection of essays is the construct of affordances, originally 
developed in ecological psychology (Gibson, 1966, 1979), but which now extends 
far beyond it—as evinced by the contributions to this collection. Indeed, by now, it 
is safe to say that affordances have become part of mainstream science. The concept 
of affordances seems to pop up everywhere, from philosophy and the social sci­
ences to the neurosciences, from design and user experience to architecture. The 
concept has become particularly important in the context of emergent technologies, 
especially extended reality technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality tech­
nologies, which at the time of writing are becoming as ubiquitous as they are poten­
tially transformative. In this short editorial, I’ve been asked to discuss what role is 
played by the construct of affordance in my work.
First caveat: Although I make use of the construct of affordances in my research, 
I am not an ecological psychologist. Moreover, the way that my colleagues and I 
have deployed the construct of affordance is controversial among ecological psy­
chologists and proponents of affordances in general (see, e.g. Raja et al., 2021, 
2022; Anderson & Chemero, 2013; Baggs & Chemero, 2020). However, one of the 
aims motivating this collection is to display the wide variety, and sometimes con­
flicting uses, of the affordance construct—and indeed, perhaps to suggest that such 
disagreements can be fruitful and that affordances are open to reinterpretation in 
other fields, adapted to field-specific research goals.
Second caveat: I am not presenting an argument that active inference is a sound 
theory (although I have tried to make the case for this elsewhere) nor that the active

inference version of the affordance construct—what I am calling Affordance 3.0, 
following tradition—is sounder than others. I will more modestly attempt to present 
the active inference conception of affordance and try to say something about where 
it fits into the history of the use of the affordance construct.
Caveats aside: Over the last decade, my colleagues and I have developed an 
approach to the free energy principle and active inference that attempts to leverage 
some of the conceptual resources of ecological psychology (e.g. Ramstead et al., 
2018b; Friston et al., 2015; Linson et al., 2018; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). In 
particular, we have proposed a new interpretation of the construct of affordance, 
based on the active inference formulation of adaptive dynamics. Active inference, at 
its core, is a theory of embodied cognition that is particular in that it draws both 
from the tools of that allow us to study complex systems in physics (e.g. from 
dynamical systems theory, which has been very popular in anti-cognitivist 
approaches to cognition) and also from information theory and geometry, which 
have fallen in disrepute in some circles—much to the detriment of scientific prog­
ress, in my view. The aim of the overall active inference framework is to bring 
adaptivity (i.e. the capacity to act proactively and constructively to perturbations) 
and sentience (the capacity to react adaptively to sensory stimuli) within the pur­
view of information physics (Ramstead et al., 2018a). In a nutshell, active inference 
says that organisms are—either in some literal sense (Kiefer, 2017) or can be use­
fully modelled as (Andrews, 2021)—probabilistic models of their environment. 
Active inference rests on a variational principle of stationary action, known as the 
free energy principle, and (according to its proponents) allows us to model the 
action-perception cycles of agents as following a path of least action, where the 
action is defined as surprise. The core intuition is that agents act such as to make 
their sensory states unsurprising.
Active inference introduces a specific version of the affordance construct—and 
its use of this core construct of ecological psychology has proven controversial. 
Ecological psychologists have rejected the active inference formulation because it 
does not sit well with their core assumptions about the best manner in which to 
study the mind, especially perception (among other reasons). Excellent reviews/
discussions include Raja et al. (2017, 2021).
I concede that these two approaches are very much in tension. However, I will 
argue that this core divergence between active inference and ecological psychology 
is not sufficient reason to think that some of the core constructs of ecological psy­
chology cannot be redeployed under active inference to fruitfully explain some core 
aspects of perception, cognition, and action. Further, I will argue that this defini­
tional pluralism is consistent with the history of the affordance construct. Indeed, 
theorists in the tradition of ecological psychology have themselves arguably not 
used the term affordance all that consistently (leading to debates among ecological 
psychologists over the meaning of the term—even its meaning in Gibson’s own 
writings). However, arguably, far from being a problem in itself, this has led to a 
wealth of new work, leading to theoretical clarification and ultimately empirical 
progress.

This short editorial argues that the active inference concept of affordance recov­
ers some of the core components of the affordance construct, legitimising the use of 
the word. So while active inference and ecological psychology may be incompati­
ble, there is (at least arguably) nothing inherently problematic about the redeploy­
ment of this concept in the active inference framework. I first provide a woefully 
short review of the history of the affordance construct ecological psychology—spe­
cifically in its two historical guises, as Affordance 1.0 (which is arguably the origi­
nal Gibsonian conception) and Affordance 2.0 (the newly rebooted and increasingly 
popular, relational version of the concept). I will then discuss affordances as they 
are used in the active inference framework—what I will be calling, self-servingly, 
Affordance 3.0. Finally, I discuss how the active inference version of affordance 
captures the core elements of the original definitions. We also refer the reader to 
Karl Friston’s essay, Chap. 19 in this collection, which provides a less conceptual 
and historical and more technically focused description of affordances in active 
inference.
18.2  A Potted History of Affordance Theory
In this short section, I present with apologies a potted, necessarily partial history of 
the concept of affordances. For a discussion of the relevant history, please see Raja 
et al. (2017) and Chemero (2009).
18.2.1  Affordances 1.0
The construct of affordances was systematised by Gibson in his 1966 The Senses 
Considered as Perceptual Systems. Gibson was presenting an argument against an 
idea that we would today call “the poverty of the stimulus”, after Chomsky’s coin­
age. Of course, Gibson himself did not argue against this idea directly, since 
Chomsky only coined the term in 1980. However, Chomsky had been working on 
these ideas since his critical 1959 assessment of Skinner’s manifesto of the behav­
iourist approach to language, Verbal Behavior (1957). By the time Gibson was 
developing his approach, these had made it into mainstream approaches to the study 
of mind.
The cognitivist assumption against which Gibson was arguing is that the streams 
of perceptual data to which living creatures have access are information-poor, that 
is, they do not contain enough information to fully represent or specify real features 
of the world. On this view, since our sensory receptors do not carry enough informa­
tion to allow for the perception of objects, they must be enriched somehow. In par­
ticular, cognitivists believe that perception is enriched via inferences premised on 
information had by the agent independently of its real-time perceptual engagement 
18  Easy as 1, 2, 3: On the Short History of the Use of Affordance in Active Inference

196
with the world. Hence, the cognitivist appeals to internal models, which harness the 
information necessary to make sense of sensory data.
Gibson claimed that this view is false and misleading: the standard cognitivist 
approach to the study of the mind was flawed because its core assumptions were 
flawed. In Gibson’s view, the cognitivist approach results from looking at the organ­
ism passively, as a mere receiver of information. The idea that the sensory surfaces 
of our bodies, or sensory arrays, are information-poor is only viable if we consider 
them statically, in isolation from the manner in which agents sample their environ­
ments perceptually.
Gibson’s theory develops an account of direct perception that he hoped would be 
apt to explain the perceptual abilities of agents by appealing only to information 
available to them directly in their sense organs. Gibson argued that when we 
embrace the dynamic and temporally extended nature of perception, we can see that 
all the information required to encode objects is readily available directly in the 
sensory array, specifically in the patterns of information that are directly readable 
from the temporally extended dynamics of sensory surfaces. When we consider the 
dynamics of sensory arrays, we are led to phenomena such as optical flow, occlu­
sion, and parallax, and we discover more structure than might be assumed from a 
static view of perception.
Originally, the term affordance referred to the object of direct perception itself. 
In Gibson’s original view, affordance is a non-relational, dispositional property of 
the environment. In other words, affordances are not properties of the sensory array, 
but rather dispositional features of the environment that are made available to the 
organism via access to ecological information. See Golonka and Wilson (2019) for 
a comprehensive presentation and defence of this position. Technically, we say that 
affordances are specified by the information to which the organism is privy, con­
tained in its sensory arrays. This ecological information (Golonka & Wilson, 2019; 
Bruineberg et al., 2019) is information that is directly readable from the sensory 
arrays of the agent, especially when it is engaging actively with its environment. On 
this account, ecological information is constituted by higher-order patterns in sen­
sory arrays, which organisms can leverage to specify or designate (and thereby 
interact with) features or properties of the environment. Thus, an affordance in the 
original sense is an environmental feature that is specified by ecological informa­
tion, which is the kind of information that is directly registered in the sensory arrays 
of an organism. Ecological information specifies affordances without the need for 
additional information provided by inference or internal models. Thus, ecological 
psychologists in the wake of Gibson have defined affordances dispositionally: 
Affordance 1.0 is a property of the environment that gets specified by ecological 
information (Wilson, 2018).
Perception is thus direct in the Gibsonian account because ecological informa­
tion specifies affordances, but information processing does not mediate the percep­
tion of affordances. Ecological psychologists argue that this notion of direct 
perception is coherent by appealing to the lawful nature of informational specifica­
tion of affordances (Turvey et al., 1981): ecological information is lawfully created 
when a medium interacts with the features of objects in the environment, some of 
M. J. D. Ramstead

197
these being affordances. The lawful character of these relations means, roughly 
speaking, that the following biconditional obtains if property is present, then infor­
mation is present and also that if information is present, then property is present, 
such that detecting the information just is perceiving the affordance. It is thus 
important to keep in mind that, in the original Gibsonian conception, affordances 
and the information that specifies them are distinct components of the analysis of 
direct perception (for a discussion, see Wilson (2018)).
18.2.2  Affordances 2.0
To readers less familiar with the original use of the construct or with contemporary 
debates in ecological psychology, a distinct but related use of the term is probably 
more familiar. This usage has become popular both colloquially and in several well-­
developed scientific and philosophical research traditions. In response to issues sur­
rounding the dispositional account of affordances (which exceed the scope of this 
paper, but are nicely reviewed in Wilson (2018)), an alternative way of thinking 
about affordances has emerged. In this new conception, the idea that affordances are 
dispositional (and, therefore, non-relational) is rejected in favour of an explicitly 
relational conception of affordance.
Chemero (2003, 2009) in particular expanded the use of the term affordance to 
describe something much broader, namely, the structured possibilities for interac­
tion between an agent and its environment. In this new conception, an affordance 
becomes a relational property that obtains between properties of an organism and 
salient properties of its environment. More precisely, Chemero (2003, 2009) defines 
Affordance 2.0 as a relational property that obtains between core features of organ­
isms, in particular the abilities that they master, and the salient features of the envi­
ronment with which they are able to interact. Thus, in the Affordances 2.0 conception, 
a chair affords sitting to an agent that has the right body and ability, etc.
This is a remarkable mutation of the concept. Defenders of the original, disposi­
tional concept of affordance have argued that the relational conception is problem­
atic—the discussion is beyond the scope of this editorial, but see Wilson (2018) and 
Wilson et al. (2016). However, despite such dissenting voices, Affordance 2.0 has 
arguably become a popular, if not the most popular, way of talking about affor­
dances. This widespread adoption of Affordance 2.0 is evident from the way that the 
construct has been deployed in the larger literature in psychology and neuroscience 
in no small part because of its relational emphases; see, e.g. Siegel (2014), Withagen 
et al. (2012), Gastelum (2020), and Cisek (2007). Anecdotally, in learning about 
embodied cognition, I learned about the relational conception of affordances before 
I learned about the debates over the proper interpretation of the construct and 
became familiar with the dispositional conception.
The point of reviewing this short history was just to show that the concept of 
affordance is subject to some disagreement within the very tradition that fostered it.

I turn now to a discussion of the way that the affordance construct has been put to 
work in the active inference literature.
18.3  Affordances 3.0? Affordances Under Active Inference
In the active inference approach, the action-perception loops of agents are modelled 
as if they were subject to the imperative to minimise something called variational 
free energy. In this context, variational free energy is a quantity from information 
theory that measures the divergence between the data that one expected to register, 
given a model of how that data was generated, and the actual data that was regis­
tered. A model in this sense is just a joint probability density that specifies the set of 
allowable, coordinated changes to the variables that make up the system. This can 
be visualised as a kind of “surface” over the state space of an organism or agent, to 
which trajectories of the system in its space are confined.
In active inference, organisms are cast as probabilistic models of their environ­
ments. Perception is modelled as inference: in other words, perception is formalised 
as inferring the most probable beliefs about what caused our sensory data, given 
what we know about the process causing that data. This can be cast in terms of 
hypothesis testing—although see Bruineberg et al. (2016). The beliefs arrived at 
through inference are the ones that most minimise free energy, i.e. the ones that lead 
to the least discrepancy with available sensory data, given some prior beliefs. In 
turn, action is modelled as a special kind of inference: heuristically speaking, infer­
ences about “what I must be doing, given my model and my sensory data”. The 
course of action or policy that ends up being selected is the one that best minimises 
expected free energy, that is, the amount of free energy expected to arise on average 
as a consequence of selecting actions.
With this in place, it is easy to define affordances under active inference: affor­
dance is modelled as the (negative) expected free energy of some policy. Here affor­
dance is used as a non-countable or mass noun referring to the compulsion, on the 
part of an agent, to pursue a particular course of action. So, unlike in the Affordances 
2.0 conception, in active inference, affordance does not denote individual or indi­
viduated possibilities for interaction; nor does it denote the object of perception as 
in Affordance 1.0. Instead, in active inference, individual possibilities for interac­
tion are formalised as policies or beliefs about possible courses of action. Intuitively, 
the free energy expected under each policy quantifies the degree to which an agent 
will find that policy compelling. So, in active inference, we have not just a means of 
individuating courses of actions (as policies) but also a measure of the degree to 
which any policy affords being pursued.
Finally, expected free energy itself can be decomposed into a pragmatic compo­
nent and an epistemic component (Friston et al., 2015). In the active inference lit­
erature, these are called epistemic and pragmatic affordance; they correspond to 
different kinds of motivation to perform an action, namely, the pragmatic reward-­
driven component (“I open the pantry because I am hungry, and there is food in the 
M. J. D. Ramstead

199
pantry”) and the information-driven, uncertainty-reducing component (“I open the 
light to get to the pantry”). One nice thing about Affordance 3.0 is that such aspects 
of goal-directed behaviour naturally fall out of decomposition of the expected free 
energy; again, the reader is referred to Karl Friston’s contribution in this collection.
18.4  Easy as 1, 2, 3: Comparing Affordance 3.0 
and Its Cousins
I will now argue that Affordance 3.0 recovers some core features of the notion as 
deployed in ecological psychology. So, while there is a tension between the frame­
works that leverage this construct, the concept of affordance that is deployed in 
active inference is arguably just one further development in the motley history of 
affordance theory, akin to the move from Affordance 1.0 to 2.0. I will briefly com­
ment on the tension before recovering the core components of the affordance con­
struct under active inference.
Active inference is not a theory of direct perception. Ecological psychology, as a 
field, is committed to the view that perception is not an indirect process mediated by 
inferences, but rather a process of directly picking up relevant features of the envi­
ronment. And it is undeniably true that active inference theorists reject direct per­
ception (Ramstead et al., 2018b, 2019). Indeed, on the active inference account, 
action-perception loops involve a kind of inference, or informational attunement, 
between the states of an agent and the external environment in which the system is 
embedded and with which it interacts. This means that active inference and ecologi­
cal psychology part ways at the level of core premises.
Arguably, the active inference construct of affordance is a bona fide redeploy­
ment of the original Gibsonian construct. The contribution of active inference is to 
make sense of how organisms decide upon possible courses of action dynamically. 
Active inference models specify the inferential architecture that (its proponents 
believe) must be in play for the agent to be able to leverage information in a sensory 
array. Active inference models expand the set of phenotypic elements that are neces­
sary to make sense of raw sensory data—these are formalised as the prior beliefs of 
a probabilistic model. Indeed, one might even view the physical structure of the 
sensory array as itself encoding some kind of prior about what counts as sensory 
data (Friston, 2011).
With respect to the mutated concept of Affordances 2.0, active inference inno­
vates with respect to ecological psychology by distinguishing between a policy and 
its affordance. We believe that this distinction allows for far more precision than the 
relational conception. In Affordance 2.0 conception, the affordance is just a relation 
between embodied skills possessed by the agent and salient features of the environ­
ment. While this is useful, it is arguably not yet a dynamical theory, because it does 
not tell us which affordances are relevant and does not tell us how organisms evalu­
ate the compellingness of affordances and select among them. Active inference 
18  Easy as 1, 2, 3: On the Short History of the Use of Affordance in Active Inference

200
arguably improves upon the Affordances 2.0 construct by helping to specify the 
actual dynamics of engagement with the environment via the selection of policies.
18.5  Concluding Remarks
Perhaps the biggest point of connection between Gibson’s ecological approach and 
active inference is their common aim to make the science of sentient systems con­
tinuous with the rest of physics. Gibson intended to extend the analysis of lawlike 
regularities from physics into psychology, with the hope of developing a bona fide 
physics of sentience, in line with the developments of mechanistic science since the 
seventeenth century, especially early Galilean and Newtonian physics (Raja et al., 
2017). As remarked at the outset, this is also the aim of those who leverage the 
(variational) principles of physics that underwrite active inference, to establish a 
bona fide physics of sentient systems (Ramstead et al., 2018b; Friston, 2019).
The active inference approach to affordance also comes with some interesting 
implications for research. One such implication, which was pointed out to us by the 
editor of this collection, is that active inference agents can be used to generate 
hypotheses about the relation between perception, salience, motivation, and behav­
iour, which is critical to neuroscience in general. Paraphrasing Dobzhansky, “noth­
ing in neuroscience makes sense except in the light of behaviour”. To be able to 
simulate motivated belief-driven behavioural responses will surely be a boon to 
neuroscience; and active inference formalisations of the concept of affordance can 
help to make these goals achievable.
The reformulation of affordance within active inference, a framework that rejects 
direct perception, is consistent with some of the core developments of the recent 
history of philosophy, in which notions of “the given” and direct perception have 
largely and roundly been rejected. In analytic philosophy, at least since the advent 
of Sellar’s 1956 The Myth of the Given, the idea that there is something like a non-­
propositional perceptual given that grounds empirical claims has largely been 
rejected. In continental philosophy, this is evident in the general move from phe­
nomenology, which is concerned with pure descriptions of lived experience, to 
hermeneutics, which focuses on interpretation, not unmediated perception 
(Gadamer, 2003). Arguably, direct perception is no longer seen as a tenable option, 
and it may be that the “reboot” of the concept in active inference is a sign of 
the times.
Finally, and perhaps controversially, it may be that a better term for Affordance 
3.0 is drive. Indeed, at a conceptual level, what proponents of active inference call 
affordance corresponds well to the Freudian construct of drive (Carhart-Harris & 
Friston, 2010; Solms, 2021; Solms & Zellner, 2012). Drive is an energetic pressure 
to act in specific ways, which seems to correspond well with the active inference 
version of affordance.

This paper was a modest attempt to present the active inference concept of affor­
dance in light of the recent history of the construct. We hope that the discussion will 
motivate greater interaction between affordance theory and active inference.

Reflections on 20 Years 
of Affordance-­Based Design
Jonathan R. A. Maier
19.1  Reflections on 20 Years of Affordance-Based Design
M. J. McDonald, in an unsolicited review (McDonald, 2013) of my book, Affordance 
Based Design: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Applications (Maier, 2011), 
opined that the application of affordances to engineering design was the “most sig­
nificant advance to design theory” that he or she had seen in 30 years of interest in 
the field. However, they also lamented the lack of a concise definition of the term 
affordance. Hopefully, the essays in this book, and this essay in particular, will help 
bolster their confidence in the former and help clarify the latter!
As a young researcher, I had come across a copy of Don Norman’s remarkable 
book The Design of Everyday Things (Norman, 1988) by chance in the late 1990s, 
in the Georgia Tech bookstore. Up until then, my early research had been into prod­
uct family design. As I read Norman’s book, the relevance of the idea of affordance 
to engineering design became immediately apparent.
In the back of my mind, I had been unsatisfied with the various conceptual bases 
on which engineering design research had been supposed. Function-based design 
was very prevalent, but it seemed to me that so many things that designers needed 
to consider were not functional in nature. My mentor at Georgia Tech, Farrokh 
Mistree, famously proposed an alternate basis, called Decision-Based Design 
(Mistree et al., 1990), inspired by earlier work by Herbert Simon and others on deci­
sion theory. The basic idea was that the design process boiled down to a series of 
decisions to be made along the way, which led to a flurry of research on decision 
support tools.
Then there was Nam Suh’s Axiomatic Design (Suh, 1990), a more theoretical 
approach which attempted to establish design on a small set of axioms similar to

those of Euclidean geometry. I found this interesting, but the more I looked at it, the 
more the axioms seemed less and less like axioms and more and more like assump­
tions or just hypotheses. I examined various other proposals from engineering 
researchers as well. (Incidentally, despite the technical field being known as Design 
Theory and Methodology, the vast majority of work in the field emphasizes method­
ology. Comparatively fewer efforts have addressed underlying theory on which 
methods should be developed; see Braha et al. (2013).)
Perhaps there is something about the engineering mind—that has been trained to 
look at solving problems in a very systematic and typically mathematical way—that 
has trouble taking enough distance from design problems such that they can see the 
difference from regular analytical engineering problems. (Thinking like an engineer 
is a common phrase and even the title of our first-year engineering textbook at 
Clemson University where I now teach.)
Don Norman, as a psychologist, had no such limitation and made the great leap 
of appropriating Gibson’s original concept of affordance from psychology (Gibson, 
1979) to product design (Norman, 1988). Under the supervision of my graduate 
school advisor, Georges Fadel, I took the concept of affordance from product design 
to engineering design more broadly, that is, from the design of everyday things to 
the design of everything (Maier & Fadel, 2001).
Gibson himself had intimated as such, having written variously about products 
of human design ranging from the architecture of buildings down to the design of 
chairs (Gibson, 1976, 1979).
My research quickly led to a distinction between what I called Artifact-User 
Affordances, which describe most of how Norman used affordances, and Artifact-­
Artifact Affordances, which describe, among other things, how gears mesh, how 
chairs stack, how pens and pencils clip onto shirt pockets, etc. Though controver­
sial, I believe that innovation is the key to allowing affordances to be used as a basis 
for design. Thereby, affordances can describe a myriad of issues related to human 
use and more technical aspects. Interestingly, those technical aspects sometimes 
admit a useful functional description, such as printing ink on paper, but some aspects 
do not, such as all stationary (or static) structures, like bridges, chairs, columns, etc. 
whose main function is just to support weight. Knowing that a bridge or a chair or a 
column has to support weight tells the designer very little about how that bridge or 
chair or column must be designed. Most of what makes a bridge a bridge, or a chair 
a chair, are non-functional in nature but can be described quite easily (in my opin­
ion) and comprehensively using affordances. (An expanded discussion of these 
theoretical issues, and lots of other technical examples such as air conditioners, 
automotive tooling, fishing rods, etc., are in my book (Maier, 2011).)
But the most surprising application of affordances to design has to be to natural 
phenomena.
Gibson himself again intimated at this, having discussed the affordances between 
people and the natural environment and indeed between people and other people 
(Gibson, 1979).
Why does a person walk the way he or she does, and a dog walk the way a dog 
does, and a rabbit hop the way a rabbit does? Because that is what each animal’s 
J. R. A. Maier

205
legs afford to the rest of their body. If the animal suffers a leg injury, they walk or 
hop differently.
It could even be argued that the physiological development of any organism is a 
result of what a combination of its genes and its environment affords. Even more 
broadly, the inanimate natural world can be described the same way. The behavior 
of the universe is a result of what the structure (as revealed, at least in part, in the 
laws of physics) of the universe affords. In all cases, from cosmology and biology 
back to engineering design and architectural design—even computer science—
structure influences behavior through what those structures afford (Maier, 2006).
This brings us back to McDonald’s chief criticism. Perhaps all this is worthless 
if we can’t precisely say what an affordance even is. (Or perhaps not, as biologists 
apparently have no difficulty researching biology, despite the fact that life itself is 
famously difficult to define.) I do agree that if an affordance can mean anything, 
then it is so ambiguous that it means nothing.
Before I propose a more succinct definition than I have before, first let me assert 
that such a definition cannot be done in the form of a mathematical equation (with 
apologies to other essays in this book that might attempt to do so). I think a central 
mistake that many engineering researchers make is to apply the mathematics of 
analysis to the field of design which requires both analysis and synthesis and cre­
ativity. While useful to an extent, beyond that extent, using analytical math to 
describe design is as futile as using analytical math to describe love. Unfortunately, 
we do not have much mathematics yet that is not analytical. When I realized this and 
went looking for mathematics to describe the relationships between designers, 
users, and artifacts, I found the 150-year-old pioneering work of Charles Peirce on 
the logic of relatives (Peirce, 1873). Unfortunately, that initial work is very limited, 
and to my knowledge, little has been done to advance this kind of relational math­
ematics since that early work of Peirce.
An interesting result from applying Peirce’s logic to affordances is the ability to 
consider the computability of affordances (just as we can consider the computabil­
ity of other relations) by attempting to write an algorithm to determine the quality 
of that affordance (see Maier, 2015).
But the key point here is that the mathematics available do not get us any closer 
to defining what exactly an affordance is.
Like any other relation, the definition of that relation is external to the set of ele­
ments (in the case of affordances, those elements would typically be users and/or 
artifacts) on which that relation exists. Addition, for example, is a concept that can­
not be defined using just integers. We need to be able to define any relation using 
either natural language or some formal language. Such formalisms themselves often 
rest on unproven axioms, so to posit a formal language to describe affordances 
seems like an unnecessary exercise. To wit, natural language will have to suffice.
(As a related aside, I would note that the lack of a precise or formal definition of 
affordance has clearly hindered the further development of affordance-based design. 
Many papers I have reviewed contain glaring misunderstandings of what affor­
dances are, often describing physical components or component properties as affor­
dances—like fingernails on a chalkboard to me, but perhaps I am partially to blame.)
19  Reflections on 20 Years of Affordance-Based Design

206
So here it is then, a revised definition of affordance, after 20 years of reflection 
on the subject:
An affordance is a relationship between two (or more) interacting systems that 
describes a potential behavior that neither system can exhibit alone.
Thus, to be clear, an affordance cannot be a physical component of a design or a 
property of a single component. An affordance is not the behavior itself when it hap­
pens. What the systems are need not be restricted in general, but in design, most 
often we are concerned with the affordances involving users and artifacts. Each 
system can be a group (of people or parts) or an individual (person or part).
Table 19.1 includes several affordances in tabular form. In all cases, the affor­
dance describes the potential behavior between system 1 and system 2.
As a general rule, if an affordance cannot be described as x-ability, it is probably 
not an affordance and may in fact just be a property of a single system like a com­
ponent part or a behavior. Likewise, if two potentially interacting systems cannot be 
identified, whatever is being described is probably not an affordance. Sometimes a 
special word already exists in the language for an affordance, such as comfort, a 
word which already implies the physical and mental state of a person in relation to 
their immediate surroundings.
Some examples of things that are not affordances include:
•	 A part of an assembly.
•	 A user of a product or part of a user such as a hand.
•	 A physical property of an object, such as its color or density.
Thus, affordances are not so general that they can describe anything. They only 
describe certain things, the things that can happen between interacting systems. 
Happily, it is not the case then that we must discard the idea of affordances as being 
ambiguous and overly general. Many other useful concepts are very broad in nature, 
and thus difficult to define and difficult to master in practice, yet have proven useful 
and even indispensable. In earlier work, I addressed this issue specifically (Maier & 
Fadel, 2007), using the analogy of color. There are an infinite number of possible 
colors. Color is a concept that is impossible to understand by (or to explain to) a 
person blind from birth. Yet, color is indispensable to artists, most of whom master 
the art of applying its subtleties.
Another way to describe or document affordances is in the form: system 1 affords 
behavior to system 2. This method avoids the necessity of naming each affordance

and thus some of the awkwardness of a list of affordances all ending in ability. 
Using the affordances in Table 19.1:
•	 Keyboards afford typing to people.
•	 Two gears afford power transmission.
•	 Letters afford reading to people.
•	 Air conditioning affords cool air to people.
•	 Recliners afford reclining to people.
•	 Clamps afford clamping to loose objects.
A third way to describe or document affordances, and the least general, is the 
teleological form: an affordance is what system 1 is for (with respect to system 2). 
This kind of description implies intent on behalf of either a designer of that affor­
dance or on behalf of one of the two interacting systems. Again using the affor­
dances in Table 19.1:
•	 Typing is what a keyboard is for (to a person needing to type).
•	 Power transmission is what two gears are for (to a mechanical designer needing 
to transmit power).
•	 Reading is what letters are for (to a person needing to read).
•	 Cool air is what air conditioning is for (to a person needing to be cooled).
•	 Reclining is what recliners are for (to people wanting to recline).
•	 Clamping is what a clamp is for (to a person needing to clamp loose objects).
Generally, I think it is a good practice to adopt a single method for describing 
affordances in any given project, whichever seems most appropriate to the project 
at hand.
All of the properties of affordances I have previously enumerated (see Maier, 
2011) still apply, namely, complementarity (that two or more interacting systems 
are necessary for an affordance to exist), imperfection (that, in general, affordances 
cannot be optimized in the way that some mathematical functions can be), polarity 
(that affordances can be considered positive or negative, from the standpoint of a 
human user), multiplicity (that multiple affordances can exist between the same two 
or more systems), and quality (that affordances vary in quality, instead of existing 
or not existing in a binary sense).
Using my revised definition of affordances, I had to return to some of the affor­
dances I have discussed in previous work, and I must admit that some of them do 
not meet the standard of the new revised definition. In particular, I had to reflect on 
whether or not affordances could be self-referential. Can a system afford a behavior 
to itself (i.e., can system 1 = system 2)? To some extent, that is an open question, but 
my current thinking is that the answer to this question is no.
The instance in which this distinction would be most interesting is my earlier 
proposition that organisms afford life (see Maier, 2011). But life is a behavior of 
organisms. Using the teleological definition, though, perhaps life is what an organ­
ism is for. This is certainly an avenue for future thought.
I had also previously written that brains afford thinking (see Maier, 2011). Our 
brains could be said to afford thinking (one of its behaviors) to the rest of the body,

just as a liver could be said to afford filtering (one of its behaviors) to the rest of the 
body, or legs afford walking to the rest of the body. However, the brain is part of the 
body, just as the liver and legs are. When a body walks using its legs, the legs are 
also walking. So there is indeed the necessity for self-reference whenever system 1 
is a part of system 2. Again, this issue deserves more exploration.
This kind of entanglement certainly makes behavior difficult to predict. As men­
tioned above, the behavior of the universe can be said to result from what its struc­
ture affords. To take a simple example, between two interacting particles, there are 
many affordances, describing potential behaviors. They may magnetically attract or 
repulse depending on their orientation. They may transfer heat from the warmer to 
the cooler. They may collide and perhaps bounce, deform, or shatter. They will cer­
tainly gravitationally attract. The amount of attraction is dependent upon both the 
mass of the first particle and the mass of the second particle—interestingly, it is the 
product of the two masses, not their sum, that determines the resulting force, in 
Newton’s familiar equation for universal gravitation. But when a third particle is 
introduced, the resulting behavior is famously unsolvable analytically. Yet the uni­
verse has no trouble in determining the behavior in real time. Perhaps this simple 
example speaks to the larger difficulty we face in attempting to predict the behavior 
of real users with the products we design, as again we are confronted with the limi­
tations of analytical mathematics.
Finally, the editor asked “perhaps a last, and more provocative question; are 
affordances measurable, if not, then how are they identified?”
My answer to the first part of the question is an unequivocable yes: affordances 
are measurable, in the sense that their quality can be measured. For example, the 
quality of the affordance of typability of a keyboard design can be measured in a 
variety of ways, such as the speed at which users can type on it, in words per minute, 
or more subjectively in terms of finger or wrist discomfort after typing for a certain 
amount of time.
The answer to the second part of the question is a little less straightforward, 
because we need to distinguish between (1) the necessity of designers identifying 
the affordances of an artifact with respect to certain users and (2) the ability of users 
to identify the affordances of an artifact. Both are critical. For the latter, ecological 
psychologists since Gibson himself have discussed the ways in which people can 
identify, or, in their terminology, directly perceive, the affordances of artifacts. For 
the former, more work needs to be done. Designers who are better at anticipating the 
affordances of a new product design would clearly have an economic advantage 
over less capable designers.
So in this brief article, I hope I have helped answer the call for a more precise 
definition of affordances. As with all answers to questions in science, however, that 
answer merely raises more nuanced and interesting questions. Hopefully, research­
ers, such as those surveyed throughout this new volume, will continue to elucidate 
and apply the powerful concept of affordance for decades to come.

Affordance and Active Inference
Karl Friston
My reading of affordance is that it underwrites the enactive aspect of perception. 
Indeed, if one wanted to talk about sentient behaviour, it would be almost impossi­
ble not to commit to some notion of affordance. Affordance plays a special role in 
active inference and has a privileged position within the larger scheme of self-­
organised behaviour. Let me explain.
Active inference (Parr & Friston, 2017) is a corollary or process theory that fol­
lows from the free energy principle (Friston, 2010). Put simply, the free energy 
principle is a somewhat deflationary account of systems that actively self-organise 
to ensure they keep themselves in some characteristic or recognisable state of being. 
Technically, this means that they have an attracting set of states that characterises 
the system in question (Crauel & Flandoli, 1994). The very existence of this attract­
ing set means that self-organising systems, whether particles or people, must have 
certain properties.
One way of articulating these existential properties is in terms of self-evidencing 
(Hohwy, 2016; Palacios et al., 2017). In other words, everything a particle or person 
does or thinks has to be in the service of soliciting evidence for its own existence. 
Formally, this means that internal (brain) states and active states (like actuators or 
autonomic reflexes) respond to sensory input in a way that must increase the evi­
dence for a model of how that input was generated. In statistics, this is known as the 
marginal likelihood, which means that all my perception and behaviour is aimed at 
making the sensorium as likely—or predictable—as possible, given the kind of 
creature that I am. So where does affordance get into the game?
There are many ways of complying with the free energy principle. In terms of 
active inference, this means that there are many ways of understanding sentient 
behaviour as realised in different self-organising systems. For simple systems—like

particles and plants—the way that they act on the world is largely in the moment, 
via a repertoire of reflexes. One might ask how does a reflex increase marginal like­
lihood? The answer is straightforward: under certain simplifying assumptions, 
increasing model evidence is the same as decreasing surprise or prediction errors. 
This means that if I predict that my body will do this—and my motor or autonomic 
reflexes fulfil those predictions (Feldman, 2009; Gu & FitzGerald, 2014)—then I 
can actively suppress prediction errors quickly and efficiently.
Those that cannot be suppressed by action can be resolved by changing my pre­
dictions: literally, changing my mind about states of affairs generating sensory 
input. These two ways of minimising prediction error can be regarded as action and 
perception that, together, constitute sentient behaviour in a properly enactivist, 
embedded and embodied sense (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Pezzulo et al., 2015; 
Seth, 2013). However, there are other ways of self-evidencing that may be more apt 
to describe creatures like you and me. Figure 20.1 provides an illustrative example 
of the biologically plausible action (and action-observation) that can be reproduced 
under this simple kind of active inference.
For particles and plants (and thermostats and viruses), it may be entirely suffi­
cient to act in the moment and resolve any prediction errors that cannot be actively 
suppressed by changing internal states, e.g. intracellular states or states of mind 
(Calvo & Friston, 2017; Friston et al., 2015a). However, if the generative model—
generating predictions necessary to form prediction errors—includes a model of the 
future, then the game changes fundamentally. This is because certain creatures may 
be able to model the consequence of their actions. If they can do this, they can then 
select those plans or policies that will secure the greatest evidence for their exis­
tence in the future.
In other words, actions can be selected from plans that minimise prediction error 
or surprise expected after acting. This means that there is a first principle account of 
how we choose to act—and which courses of action we commit to. This account 
requires that we select those actions that minimise expected surprise, namely, that 
minimise uncertainty following the action. Put simply, I will choose those actions 
that either resolve uncertainty or avoid surprises. So, what does this mean in 
practice?
If I am a creature that can predict the consequences of my actions, then there are 
two ways in which I can minimise expected surprise. First, I could choose those 
actions that resolve my uncertainty about states of affairs in the world. For example, 
I could look behind me to see if I am being followed or not. Or I could watch the 
news on television to see how international affairs are unfolding. In short, I could 
indulge in some kind of epistemic foraging. This aspect of behaviour is closely 
related to the notion of intrinsic motivation in robotics and artificial curiosity in 
machine learning (Barto et al., 2013; Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007; Schmidhuber, 2010; 
Schwartenbeck et al., 2019). However, there is another way I can minimise surprise 
that rests upon the kind of states or outcomes that characterise me. For example, I 
tend to take those actions that keep my introspective sensations within homeostatic 
bounds—and I tend to avoid noxious outcomes (Allen et al., 2019; Seth, 2013, 2014).

Fig. 20.1  Autonomous movement. This figure shows the results of simulating active inference 
(here, writing), in terms of conditional expectations about hidden states of the world, consequent 
predictions about sensory input and ensuing behaviour. The autonomous dynamics that underwrite 
this behaviour rest upon prior expectations about states prescribed by a generative model with 
autonomous dynamics that can be thought of as a central pattern generator—modelled with Lotka-­
Volterra dynamics: these are the six coloured lines in the upper left panel. In this generative model, 
each state is associated with a location in Euclidean space that attracts an agent’s finger. In effect, 
the agent’s internal (e.g. neuronal) states then supply predictions of what sensory states should 
register if the agent’s beliefs were true. Active states try to suppress the ensuing prediction error 
(i.e. maximising accuracy) by reflexively fulfilling expected changes in angular velocity, through 
exerting forces on the agent’s joints. The subsequent movement of the arm is traced out in the 
lower left panel. This trajectory has been plotted in a moving frame of reference so that it looks like 
synthetic handwriting (e.g. a succession of ‘j’ and ‘a’ letters). The lower left panels show the activ­
ity of the fourth hidden state under action and action-observation. During action, sensory states 
register both the visual and proprioceptive consequences of movement, while under action-­
observation, only visual sensations are available—as if the agent was watching another agent. The 
red dots correspond to the time bins during which this state exceeded an amplitude threshold of 
two arbitrary units. They key thing to note here is that this unit responds preferentially when, and 
only when, the motor trajectory produces a downstroke, but not an upstroke. Please see Friston 
et al. (2011) for further details. Furthermore, with a slight delay, this internal state responds during 
action and action-observation. From a biological perspective, this is interesting because it speaks 
to mirror neuron activity (Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Kilner et  al., 2007; Rizzolatti & 
Craighero, 2004)

Fig. 20.2  Bayesian mechanics and active inference. This graphic summarises the belief updating 
implicit in the minimisation of variational and expected free energy. It provides a generic (active) 
inference scheme that has been used in a wide variety of applications and simulations, ranging 
from games in behavioural economics (FitzGerald et  al., 2015) and reinforcement learning 
(Schwartenbeck et al., 2015) through to language (Friston et al., 2017c) and scene construction 
(Mirza et al., 2016). In this setup, discrete actions solicit a sensory outcome that informs approxi­
mate posterior beliefs about hidden or external states of the world—via minimisation of variational 
free energy under a set of plausible policies (i.e. perceptual inference). The approximate posterior 
beliefs are then used to evaluate expected free energy and subsequent beliefs about action (i.e. 
policy selection). Note a subtle but important move in this construction: the expected free energy 
furnishes prior beliefs about policies. This is interesting from several perspectives. For example, it 
means that agents infer policies and, implicitly, active states. In other words, beliefs about poli­
cies—encoded by internal states—are distinct from the active states of the agent’s Markov blanket. 
With a sufficiently deep generative model, agents can infer hidden states under plausible policies. 
This means the agent predicts how she will behave and then verify those predictions based on 
sensory samples. In other words, agents garner evidence for their own behaviour and actively self-­
evidence. In sum, this means the agent (will appear to) have elemental beliefs about its enactive 
self—beliefs that endow it with a sense of purpose, in virtue of the prior preferences that constitute 
risk. A key insight from formulation is that the generative model can be quite different from the 
process by which external states generate sensory states. In effect, this enables agents to author 
their own sensorium in a fashion that has close connections with econiche construction (Bruineberg 
& Rietveld, 2014). Please see Friston et al. (2017b) for technical details and Friston et al. (2017a) 
for a discussion of how the implicit belief updating might be implemented in the brain
Figure 20.2 provides a schematic based upon something called a Markov blanket 
that distinguishes between states that are internal to an agent and states that are 
external. In this setup, external states influence internal states via sensory states, 
while internal states influence external states via active states. This reciprocal or 
circular causality can be regarded as a mathematical image of the action-perception

Fig. 20.3  Epistemic foraging. This figure shows the results of a simulation in which a face was 
presented to an agent, whose responses were simulated by selecting active states that minimised 
expected free energy following an eye movement. The agent had three internal images or hypoth­
eses about the stimuli she might sample (an upright face, an inverted face and a rotated face). The 
agent was presented with an upright face, and her posterior expectations were evaluated over 16 
(12 ms) time bins, until the next saccade was emitted. This was repeated for eight saccades. The 
ensuing eye movements are shown as red dots at the end of each saccade in the upper row. The 
corresponding sequence of eye movements is shown in the inset on the upper left, where the red 
circles correspond roughly to the proportion of the visual image sampled. These saccades are 
driven by prior beliefs about the direction of gaze based upon the salience maps in the second row. 
These salience maps are the expected free energy as a function of policies, namely, where to look 
next. Note that these maps change with successive saccades as posterior beliefs about the hidden 
states, including the stimulus, become progressively more confident. Note also that salience is 
depleted in locations that were foveated in the previous saccade, because these locations no longer 
have epistemic affordance (i.e. the ability to reduce uncertainty or expected free energy). 
Empirically, this is known as inhibition of return. Oculomotor responses are shown in the third row 
in terms of the two hidden oculomotor states corresponding to vertical and horizontal eye move­
ments. The associated portions of the image sampled (at the end of each saccade) are shown in the 
fourth row. The final two rows show the accompanying posterior beliefs in terms of their sufficient 
statistics and stimulus categories, respectively. The posterior beliefs are plotted here in terms of

is that the expectation about the true stimulus supervenes over alternative expectations, and, as a 
result, conditional confidence about the stimulus category increases (and the confidence intervals 
shrink to the expectation). This illustrates the nature of evidence accumulation when selecting a 
hypothesis or percept that best explains sensory states. Within-saccade accumulation is evident 
even during the initial fixation with further stepwise decreases in uncertainty as salient information 
is sampled at successive saccades. Please see Friston et al. (2012a) for further details
cycle. However, in this instance, actions are chosen carefully from (posterior) 
beliefs about the consequences of action, namely, chosen carefully according to 
their affordances.
On this view, the imperatives that underwrite planning just are affordances. The 
two kinds of affordances we have considered are epistemic affordances—that 
resolve uncertainty through epistemic foraging—and pragmatic affordances that 
ensure outcomes that I find unsurprising and comfortingly familiar. When com­
bined, these dual aspect affordances can be expressed as a single expected surprise, 
called expected free energy (Friston et al., 2015b; Parr and Friston, 2019). See also 
Fig. 20.2.
Technically, this means that the existential imperatives for planned behaviour 
can be cast in terms of responding to epistemic and pragmatic affordances. The 
epistemic affordance reflects my current beliefs—and the accompanying uncer­
tainty about the world ‘out there’—while pragmatic affordance reflects the propen­
sity of my actions to evince the states and outcomes that characterise creatures like 
me. Typically, when placed in a new environment, epistemic affordances predomi­
nate until uncertainty has been resolved, leaving the pragmatic affordances to super­
vene (Friston et al., 2015b; Moulin & Souchay, 2015). Behaviourally speaking, this 
means that self-evidencing—under generative models of the consequences of 
action—initially invokes exploratory behaviour that gives way to exploitative 
behaviour, when I am familiar with my new environment. In this sense, affordance 
is at the heart of sentient behaviour, where behaviour is read as the things we choose 
to do. An example of epistemic affordance and information foraging is provided in 
Fig. 20.3 that simulates active visual searches to resolve uncertainty about the visual 
scene generating sensory inputs.
Because this framing of sentient behaviour is based upon a first principle account, 
it has a formal (mathematical) basis. This means it is easy to quantify affordances in 
exactly the same way that a statistician can quantify the evidence for one model of 
her data versus an alternative to model or hypothesis. Indeed, the objective function 
behind active inference is used in many statistical and machine learning schemes, 
where it is known as variational free energy or an evidence bound (Winn & Bishop, 
2005). This is important because it means that the expected free energy is equally 
well-defined and quantifiable. In turn, this means that epistemic and pragmatic 
affordances can be measured quantitatively (Friston et  al., 2015b). Crucially, 
because they are both expressed in terms of log probabilities, they have natural 
units. These can be read as bits of information (or nats when using natural 
logarithms).
K. Friston

217
The implication of this formulation is as follows: if one knew—or estimated—
the generative model that you were using to explore your environment, then one 
could evaluate the epistemic and pragmatic affordance of each plausible plan of 
action in terms of bits (or nats). In so doing, one can effectively cast the value of 
information in the same currency as pragmatic value, sometimes described as utility 
in economics (Fleming & Sheu, 2002; Howard, 1966; Kauder, 1953). This means 
that my preferred outcomes or states of being can be quantified in relation to my 
imperatives to resolve uncertainty about the environment that I am exploring. Notice 
that something quite subtle has happened in this treatment of affordances, which we 
will conclude with.
Typically—and certainly in the twentieth century—affordances were assumed to 
be attributes of an external, or at least lived, world (Cisek, 2007; Gibson, 1977). In 
other words, that chair affords the opportunity for sitting; that door affords the 
opportunity for opening; that window affords the opportunity for looking; and so 
on. However, in the active inference, affordance becomes an attribute of the plan or 
course of action (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Cisek, 2007; Friston et al., 2012b; 
Veissiere et al., 2019). In other words, it is the affordance of sitting, opening or look­
ing that underwrites policy selection. This is a subtle move that means one cannot 
separate affordance—as an attribute of the thing to be acted upon—from the acting 
per se. This brings us back to the fundament of active inference, namely, the way we 
perceive our world is inherently enactive: there is nothing more than sentient behav­
iour. Perhaps this is most simply expressed as we do not see, we look. We do not 
hear, we listen. We do not feel, we touch. On this view, it is the looking, listening 
and feeling that realises affordances.
