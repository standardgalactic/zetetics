IBM Jargon and General Computing Dictionary
Tenth Edition
Preface
This is the Tenth Edition of the IBM Jargon and General Computing Dictionary, dated May 1990.
This
edition follows the markup and format of the last (Ninth) edition, and has more than one hundred and seven-
ty new entries (bringing the total to over fourteen hundred entries).
This is not only the tenth edition of the dictionary, but is also its tenth year; the first edition was compiled
and distributed in 1980.
At that time the use of jargon was on the increase, but I now observe that the
quantity and use of jargon appears to be decreasing – perhaps as computing becomes less of a specialist
discipline. Not only does this make my task as editor of the dictionary a little easier, but it might also imply
that the computing industry is at last getting better at communicating with its customers!
As usual, I am indebted to the content and management reviewers for this edition: Geoff Bartlett, Ian
Brackenbury, Peter Capek, Philip Cohen, Bertrand Denoix, Truly Donovan, Forrest Garnett, and Ray
Mansell. Any errors that remain are, of course, entirely my responsibility.
I should also like to thank the hundreds of people who have contributed words or definitions to this diction-
ary. I have been especially encouraged by the diversity of the contributors, who come from more than forty
countries and from all divisions of IBM.
Newcomers to IBM have proved to be the most sensitive to
jargon, and the old-timers (some from very high levels in the Corporation) have provided most of the history
and anecdotes.
Without the encouragement from readers, and, of course, the VNET communications
network, this document would never have been created.
The Content of the Dictionary
The items in this dictionary have been selected from the huge vocabulary of computer-related terms used in
IBM. To be included here, a word or phrase must either have originated in IBM, or (more commonly) its
meaning or usage in IBM must be different from the usual.
Acronyms and abbreviations are not included
except where they are necessary for cross-references, or are used as true words in their own right (for exam-
ple, “APAR”).
The origin of a usage is often obscure, so a few words may have slipped in under false colours. Do please
send me any corrections or background material which will improve the accuracy of this collection. You are
also encouraged to send possible additions to this dictionary – words and phrases, new or old, English or
not. All contributions are most welcome. If possible, please include the source and date of any usage you
quote.
This dictionary is intended both to inform and to entertain.
Each entry has a definition, which is usually
supplemented by an explanation and an example of usage.
Formal etymologies are not included, since in
most cases the etymology is either unknown or disputed. In many cases, a meaning or usage is so subtle or
bizarre that a light treatment is more appropriate (and conveys the sense better) than an attempt to define the
term formally. As a result, this compilation is not just a source of information but is also a window on the
IBM culture, as reflected in its language.

Tenth Edition
Dictionary of IBM Jargon

This dictionary is perhaps most useful to people new to the vocabulary of IBM. For this reason, the docu-
ment in printed form is unclassified. It contains no material proprietary to IBM. The material is, however,
substantially novel and is therefore protected by copyright. Producing printed copies of this document with-
in IBM, or copying in printed form for private use is allowed, provided that reproduction is done without
alteration.
Permission for any other form of publication must be obtained from the editor, together with
appropriate management and legal approvals.
The Format of the Items
The structure of the dictionary is formalised by the use of a generic markup language, which conforms
(except for commentary) to the reference syntax of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML, ISO
standard 8879).
Each item in the dictionary starts with a headword, which can be a single word or a phrase. Headwords are
shown in lower case, except when they are always used in a particular upper or mixed case. The headword
is followed by a pronunciation where not obvious (or where different from normal English).
Every headword is followed by one or more senses. A sense starts with a part of speech, where appropriate,
which is followed by a definition – normally a single sentence.
The definition is usually followed by an
explanation, which may include quotations illustrating the use of the headword.
These quotations are of
actual usage (with occasional minor editorial elucidations) unless introduced by the word “usage”, in which
case the quotation is illustrative.
Within a definition or explanation, cross-references to words or phrases defined elsewhere in the dictionary
are shown in an oblique sans serif font, thus (or are identified by some other typographic convention,
depending on the SCRIPT processor and printer used).
Subsidiary headwords, defined within an item, are
shown in the same font as the headwords at the start of items.
A number of abbreviations are used. Parts of speech may be shown as one of n., v., adj., and adv., which
refer to noun, verb, adjective, and adverb respectively (these are often not the usual part of speech for the
word or phrase!). Elsewhere, cf. stands for confer, compare with; e.g. for exempli gratia, for example; etc.
for et cetera, and so on; i.e. for id est, that is; and q.v. for quod vide, which see.
The items that are new in the current (Tenth) edition are marked with a bar in the left margin, and the items
that were new in the last (Ninth) edition are marked by dots in the left margin. Editorial asides are bracket-
ed, [thus]. In general, British spelling and punctuation are used, though for headwords, quotations, and the
expansion of abbreviations the original form (often from the USA) will be found.

ABEND
all hands meeting
ABEND (ab-end) 1. n. The undesirable termination of
a program (or system).
From “ABnormal ENDing”.
Invariably due to human error at some point that the
system was unable to overcome or ignore.
Typically
results in catch-all error messages (e.g., “syntax error”)
that rarely help determine the cause. 2. v. To end
abnormally. See also crash.
. A-Box n. A primary storage unit: the one closest to the
.
controller.
Most 370 storage peripherals come in two
.
flavours.
The A-Box (also called head of string, or
.
Model A) either houses the controller (e.g., 3422), is the
.
controller (e.g., 3480), or connects to the controller.
.
The B-Box (Model B) is used for extending the string.
.
Some strings can be connected to the controller at both
.
ends, in which case the unit at the end of the string is
.
usually a Model D.
. accept n. A purchased and (usually) installed product,
.
most often used in the plural.
As in: “The demand
.
number 
is 
the 
marketing 
estimate 
of 
customer
.
accepts...”.
account situation n. Circumstances at a customer
installation which could lead to IBM losing revenue or
reputation. A “red alert” state for a branch office. See
also critical situation.
. acronym n. A word formed from the (or some) initial
.
letters of other words and often printed in uppercase.
.
Strictly speaking, if it can only be pronounced letter-by-
.
letter then it is merely an abbreviation.
An example of
.
an acronym: “Acronyms: A Convenient Reduction Of
.
Nomenclature Yielding Mnemonic Syllables”.
acronym
.
is, in itself, not an IBM word, but acronyms are a way
.
of life in the computer business; there are so many acro-
.
nyms and abbreviations in use in IBM, and so many are
.
coined each day, that this dictionary cannot attempt to
.
list them. It must suffice to record the discovery of one
.
of a number of three-level acronyms: GOCB.
In this
.
acronym, the O stands for OSD, in which the O stands
.
for OSI.
The G stands for GTMOSI (a mere two
.
levels), and so the full expansion of GOCB is: “General
.
Teleprocessing Monitor for Open Systems Intercon-
.
nection Open Systems Interconnection Session Driver
.
Control Block”. See also TLA.
action 1. v. To do something, or (more commonly) to
delegate to someone something that needs to be done.
“We must action finishing off the documentation.”
2. n. An action, agreed at a meeting, that a particular
person is expected to take.
“I have an action to organ-
ize this year’s family dinner.”
| action item n. An action (q.v.) recorded in the minutes
|
of a meeting, or brought forward to the agenda of the
|
next meeting.
action plan n. A plan.
Project management is never
satisfied by just a plan.
The only acceptable plans are
action plans.
Also used to mean an ad hoc short-term
scheme for resolving a specific and well defined prob-
lem.
. added value 1. n. The features or bells and whistles
.
that distinguish one product from another. As in: “This
.
mission is strategic to our division. If we are to keep it,
|
our proposals must have visible added value.” 2. n. The
|
additional peripherals, software, support, installation,
|
etc., provided by a dealer, such as an IBM VAR (Value
|
Added Reseller) or VAD (Value Added Dealer).
adder n. An increment.
“These costs won’t look so
attractive with the burden and inflation adders.” Nomi-
nated for most obnoxious neologism of 1980. The word
uplift is now a common and equally obnoxious alterna-
tive.
address v. To talk about. Used when a speaker cannot
answer a question, as in: “I shall address that subject
another time” (this implies that, of course, the speaker
has considered the subject in great depth, but sadly has
not enough time now to give it the treatment it
deserves). See offline.
adjective v. To use a word as an adjective modifying
some other word which in fact modifies the adjectived
word.
This avoids the normal use of prepositions and
dependent clauses, as in “user effects” (instead of
“effects on users” or “effects caused by users”). Anoth-
er example is “That is a documentation hit” (rather than
“That is a hit on the documentation”). See also verb.
administrivia n. Any kind of bureaucratic red tape or
paperwork, IBM or not, that hinders accomplishment of
one’s objectives or goals.
Often, anything with a rout-
ing slip attached.
adtech n. Advanced Technology.
Time put aside for a
risky project, not necessarily directly related to a prod-
uct.
May mean: a) Play time (when someone else is
doing it), or b) Exciting, innovative system design with
no product deadlines (when speaker is doing it).
aeroplane rule, airplane rule 1. n. “When you are
lost, climb and confess”.
2. n. Complexity increases
the possibility of failure; a twin-engine aeroplane is
more expensive and has twice as many engine problems
as a single engine aeroplane.
When applied to large
computing systems, the analogy is that two power
supplies (even though running at overrated current
output) driving two boards of logic are much more reli-
able than four power supplies of correct value with each
pair driving each of two logic boards.
When reliability
is the stronger consideration a different design will
result than when availability (with concurrent mainte-
nance) is the major criterion. See fence out.
aggressive 1. adj. Optimistic, vigorous, very active. In
IBM, implies an element of risk: “We are moving into
the new technology on a very aggressive schedule.”
|
2. adj. Over-ambitious.
As used on a foil: “1988 plan
|
was very aggressive”, which actually meant “we did not
|
make target” and “the forecasters got it wrong again”.
air movement device n. A mechanical rotating compo-
|
nent with angled blades, used in the IBM PC family and
|
in the 4341 processor for cooling purposes. When used
|
in the (now defunct) IBM Copiers, it was known as an
|
air cooling device.
[Even earlier, it was known as a
“fan”; the term has been abbreviated for convenience.]
| alarm v. To fit with an alarm device.
Observed on
|
doors in San Jose and elsewhere: “This door is
|
alarmed”. [Soothe, soothe...]
. all-blue adj. Of a customer: having purchased all major
.
computing equipment from IBM. “An all-blue account.”
.
See also true blue.
| all cycles to list expression. Nothing new. Old-timer’s
|
response to “How are you”? This was the standard “just
|
list” invocation, wired on an accounting machine panel.
|
See also CI to C.
. all-elbows adj. Of a resident PC program: unsociable.
.
Used to describe a program that bluntly steals the
.
resources that it needs without regard to others.
all hands meeting n. A meeting, called by upper
management, which everyone working on a given
project is required to attend. Probably from the nautical
“All hands on deck!” Since most of these meetings are
called to announce changes in the management tree,
there is some evidence that the intended reference is to
shuffling the deck.

alphameric 
assembler
alphameric n. Alpha-Numeric.
Used to describe those
characters that are either alphabetic or numeric.
The
alphamerics are often restricted to a single case of
alphabetic, and rarely include any non-English alphabet-
ics.
Amber n. The master disk of a public conferencing facili-
ty.
This refers to Roger Zelazny’s Nine Princes In
Amber fantasy series.
Amber is (sort of) the real
universe; other apparent realities are (in some sense)
incomplete copies of Amber (they are called “shadows”
of Amber). See master.
American tourist n. A VIP (Visiting (sic) Important
Person) from the USA.
A breed of corporate manager
or staff assistant that suffers from an urge to visit
European locations (usually within driving distance of
the Mediterranean) during the months of July or August,
thus preventing employees from taking their vacations
when they would like to. 1986 (the year of the Libyan
affair and the Paris bombings) was a nice quiet year for
Europeans.
angel dust n. Another name for green lightning (q.v.).
Refers to the slang name for a drug [phencyclidine] that
is said to result in hallucinations and psychotropic
effects similar to the flashing streaks known as Green
Lightning.
announce n. The time at which a new product is
described to customers.
Before this time a product is
known by a code name, and specifications are strictly
confidential.
At announce, the product is assigned a
number instead of a name, with the result that not even
the developers know what it is any more. See also ESP,
FCS, GA.
APAR (ay-parr) 
1. n. Authorized Program Analysis
Report. This is an official report to IBM of an error in
a program.
The acronym is used so often that most
people don’t know what it stands for. This is one of the
many acronyms whose expansion and meaning has
changed with time.
The group in Poughkeepsie that
wrote the early System/360 systems programs (compil-
ers, sorts, etc.) were called “Applied Programming” or
“Application Programming”, hence a request for a fix
was called an “Applied Programming Assistance
.
Request”.
In the period between the demise of the
.
Applied Programming organisation and the determi-
.
nation that “AP” could mean “Authorized Program” the
.
acronym was interpreted as “Always Process As Rush”.
.
[This actually got printed on some forms.] 2. v. To
make such a report.
Note that only programs (and not
.
microcode) can be APARed. 3. n. A specific fix for a
.
reported problem [an incorrect usage]. “I’ve applied all
|
the APARs, but it still crashes.” Also APAR
|
avalanche, the result of innocently requesting a single
|
APAR to fix a simple problem, only to find that it
|
requires a number of other fixes to be installed first, and
|
that these in turn require others, and these...
APARable situation n. A reportable bug. See also crit-
ical situation, known restriction.
APL bigot n. One who considers APL to be the finest
programming language available. APL (A Programming
Language) is a popular, mathematically oriented, unread-
able, interactive language.
Usage: “An APL bigot does
not know there are any other programming languages”,
or: “It’s an APL bigot – cannot speak English”.
Alon
Caplin (known for his love of APL and for his sense of
humour) was heard to say: “You can always tell an APL
bigot, but not much”. See also bigot.
append n. A piece of text (ranging from one line to
several hundred) that is appended to a file on a confer-
ence disk.
The text may be discussions, bug reports,
suggestions, questions, or any other topic of conversa-
tion.
The value of an append is very often inversely
proportional to its length. See also conferencing facility,
forum.
. application tower n. A series of programs that have
.
been grouped together to form a package which can be
.
used conveniently for a particular application.
The
.
package is built on a common base that is shared by
.
several application towers. See tower.
architect 1. v. To design how something should work.
Usage: “We will have that architected by year end”.
.
2. v. To document, ex post facto, the way a particular
.
piece of hardware [and sometimes software] works.
architectural awareness n. An improvement to a
building. Site Facilities’ version of Feature. A popular
variety is a column placed directly in front of a door,
claimed to be deliberate.
Warning:
At the Glendale
Laboratory (Endicott), and at the Greenford Distribution
Centre (London), you will be offered attractive bets that
this has never happened. Do not accept!
architecture 1. n. The way something works.
Usage:
“They are developing a new disk architecture”.
2. adj. Documentation.
Usually in the form “architec-
ture group” that denotes a group of people who go
around finding out how the most highly esteemed IBM
products or planned products work and then document
them. These documents then become the IBM “standard
architecture” or “strategic architecture” which the rest of
the (IBM) world then has to follow.
Note: You cannot
spell “Architecture” without “hit”.
. archive v. To save data (usually electronic) in long-term
.
storage (such as magnetic tape or optical disk).
This
.
differs from backup (q.v.) in that it is intended that the
.
data be kept for a long time, perhaps indefinitely. Data
.
are archived when no longer in constant use, and the
.
space taken up by the data is needed for other purposes.
arm waving n. A technique used to convey excited
dedication to an idea, even though not supported by
arguments or facts.
“The pitch had much arm waving
but little content”. The technique may be attempting to
emulate the effect of waving one’s arms (as if trying to
fly) near a flock of seagulls [or wild ducks?] who will
then all take off together.
artificial intelligence 1. n. The opposite of natural
silliness.
2. n. A research topic in Computer Science.
Some in the computer industry seem to think that noth-
ing useful can come out of artificial intelligence (but
they don’t trust the natural kind, either).
ASCII bit (ass-key) n. A bit set to select ASCII (Ameri-
can National Standard Code for Information Inter-
change) coded information. In the System/360 computer
architecture (now obsolete), bit 12 of the Program Status
Word was designated the ASCII bit. When the bit was
off (0), the system ran using the EBCDIC (Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code) coded charac-
ter set.
When on (1), the system ran using the ASCII
coded character set. However, this ASCII operation was
never used by any of the IBM operating systems and so
the architects redefined the bit for Basic Control Mode
(0) and Extended Control Mode (1).
In hindsight, it
seems that the ASCII setting might have been conven-
ient for communication between modern mainframes and
personal computers.
Programmers at one time could turn on the ASCII bit
in the Program Check New PSW of a 3195 Processor;
this (if loaded) would drive the processor into a contin-
uous loop of Program Interruption (bad PSW) which
would fetch that same PSW (still bad).
assembler 1. n. A program that takes the symbolic
language used for writing machine level (binary)
instructions and converts that language into the machine
level instructions. 2. n. A symbolic language for writing
machine level (binary) instructions.
Also assembly

language. Usage: “You mean the whole interpreter is
written in assembler?” The original assembler language
for the System/360 series was known as BAL (Basic

Card
Programming Support, Basic Assembler Language. See
also code, microcode.
. assemblerize v. To rewrite in assembler for better
.
performance. Curiously, verbs such as “Cobolize” have
.
not appeared, perhaps because they would seldom be
.
used.
assist n. A modification to the microcode of a processor
(or to a system control program) to improve the
performance of an operating system running under that
microcode or control program. Usage: “YMS runs near-
ly twice as fast with the EM assist enabled”. There is a
side-effect in using an assist: the number of MIPS (q.v.)
measured as instruction decodes often drops substantial-
ly, even though the effective work accomplished goes
up.
. at this moment in time adv. Now.
Also at this
.
point in time, and the more pointed: at your
.
convenience (now, when pronounced by a manager).
. attrit (a-trit)
v. To remove personnel from a depart-
.
ment, usually by finding new positions for the people,
.
and usually because the department’s mission has ended.
.
As in: “I had to attrit my entire department when they
.
canceled the project.” See also attrition.
attrition n. The loss of personnel through resignation
from the company. Usage: “Attrition this year is 1.7%”.
This word is normally used to mean loss through fric-
tion or wearing down; one wonders what (or which)
agency is causing the friction. The term is also used in
this way by Experimental Psychologists. See also attrit.
. autoline n. An automatic manufacturing line for build-
.
ing components of a computer system, often well-
.
endowed with robots.
| automagically adv. Automatically, and so cleverly [or
|
obscurely] that it seems like some magic must have
|
been involved.
As in: “I have an Exec that does that
|
automagically”.
auto-pixelization n. A method of automatically deriv-
ing a dot (raster) image from the vector outline of a
shape (often a character from a font).
award n. A monetary bonus given in recognition of a
special achievement.
In Research, a cash prize often
given to signify the end of a project. Elsewhere, a cash
prize placed sometimes for political effect, but often
associated with (though not proportional to) merit.
See
also dinner for two.
backbone n. The central nodes of an electronic commu-
nication network.
The backbone of IBM’s VNET
network is managed directly by a corporate organisation,
and in the mid 1980s ran a much-enhanced version of
|
the RSCS product, known as IPORSCS.
The nodes of
|
the backbone, for example HURBB, are identified by
|
three characters of the location name, followed by BB
|
(for BackBone). At a time of a major software upgrade
|
numerous 
problems 
occurred, 
which 
led 
to 
the
|
suggestion that in fact the BB stands for bit-bucket
|
(q.v.).
back-burner v. To move something to a lower priority
in the hope that it will go away or be solved by some-
one else. “Let’s back-burner this item.” [Not originally
an IBM term.]
back-level adj. Not current.
Describes a program or
system that has not been modified with the latest
changes and enhancements. “Your system is back-level,
so 
there 
is 
no 
way 
you 
can 
run 
this 
new
super-program!” See also down-level.
back-page v. To communicate a comment on a manual
using the Reader’s Comment Form (which is on the
back or last page of the book). A way to get a change
to a manual when direct approach to the author or
developer fails.
“I think we’ll have to back-page that
item”.
backslash n. A backwards sloping slash (i.e., a solidus
that slopes from top left down to bottom right).
This
character has suddenly become overloaded, as it has
appeared relatively recently on most IBM keyboards but
used to be unavailable; every new application therefore
uses it as an “escape” character.
back-to-back remote n. A method for connecting two
computers which have been set up so they can commu-
nicate with each other only over a long-distance line,
using 3705s, modems, adapters, etc. If in fact the two
machines are sitting in the same room, then the line
terminals of the two machines can simply be connected
by short wires. Often useful in initial testing.
. backup 1. v. To make a copy of data in a separate
.
place in case of inadvertent loss of the primary (work-
.
ing) copy. Often a tedious and time-consuming process,
.
and so commonly done less frequently and thoroughly
.
than would be ideal. 2. adj. Secondary, reserve. As in:
.
“What’s the backup plan?” See also archive, Iron Moun-
.
tain.
. BAD adj. Of a program: Broken As Designed.
Used to
.
describe a program whose design, rather than implemen-
.
tation, is flawed.
This term originated (and is mostly
.
used) outside IBM, often in reaction to an IBM “Work-
.
ing as Designed” APAR response.
badge 1. n. A small rectangular piece of plastic (show-
ing the holder’s name and photograph) that purports to
prove the identity of the bearer.
Identification badges
are almost always required to gain access to IBM
buildings. In addition, at most large locations they must
be worn at all times.
This wearing of badges is of
doubtful value, however, as at least one study has shown
that normal suspicion of a stranger is inhibited if a
person sees an official-looking badge prominently
displayed.
2. v. To use a badge to unlock a door.
A
task made harder than it need be, since most badge-
holders are designed for display rather than for use.
Usage: “Each employee must badge in and badge out”.
.
3. v. To mark with a badge.
The main IBM computer
.
center in Palo Alto has (or had) a large sign at the main
.
entrance reading “Badged Employees Only”.
| badge run n. A walk among all of the areas (such as
|
machine test laboratories) where one’s badge has been
|
authorised to allow entry, inserting the badge, opening
|
the door (and maybe peeking in), and then leaving to go
|
to the next area. The purpose of this is to leave a usage
|
trail to stop automatic systems removing your badge
|
from the authorised entry list simply because you
|
haven’t used your access privileges enough.
bad information 1. n. Lies. 2. n. The truth, expressed
euphemistically. There is a story (abbreviated here) that
well illustrates this:
Programmer to manager, “This is
manure”.
Manager to second-level, “This is fertiliser”.
Second-level to third-level, “This makes things grow”.
Third-level to Director, “Must be good stuff”. After an
external audit, the misinformed protect themselves by
saying: “My people gave me bad information”. See also
CYA.
bad response n. A delay in the response time to a triv-
ial request of a computer that is longer than two tenths
of one second.
In the 1970s, IBM 3277 display termi-
nals attached to quite small System/360 machines could
service up to 19 interruptions every second from a user
[I measured it myself].
Today, this kind of response
time is considered “impossible” or “unachievable”, even

ballpark 
beta test
though work by Doherty, Thadhani, and others has
shown that human productivity and satisfaction are
almost linearly inversely proportional to computer
response time.
It is hoped (but not expected) that the
definition of “Bad Response” will drop below one tenth
of a second by 1990.
. ballpark v. To make a rough estimate.
Derived from a
.
baseball term.
Usage: “If you don’t have the number,
.
can you ballpark it for me?”
banana 1. n. A parenthesis.
A term used especially
when dictating computer language, as in: “list fred splat
splat left-banana label” for “LIST FRED * * (LABEL”.
2. n. One unit of skill in repairing equipment.
IBM’s
avowed goal is to design machines whose maintenance
is so simple that the repair engineers can be replaced by
trained monkeys. Hence, the lowest three levels of field
repairs are sometimes jokingly called One-, Two-, or
Three-Banana tasks. This concept was used by the RAS
group for the 3850 Mass Storage System at Boulder in
the mid 1970s.
At this time there were only one-and
two-banana tasks. The idea was developed in the 308X
RAS and SPR shops, and was extended to three-banana
tasks. [Such is the march of inflation.]
| banana curve, planning banana 1. n. The basis of a
|
forecasting technique popular in the 1970s.
The meth-
|
od: using as much historical data as can be found, esti-
|
mated, or invented, calculate for each month the
|
best-ever year-to-date attainment as a percentage of the
|
year-end total for that year.
Similarly, compute the
|
worst-ever result (which probably happened in a differ-
|
ent year).
Plotting the results by month produces two
|
curves which both start at 0% and end at 100% but
|
usually diverge in between. Because attainment tends to
|
accelerate towards yearend, the region between the
|
curves resembles a banana.
In use, then, the current
|
year’s attainment was plotted, and if the plot began to
|
fall outside the banana, [an early example of “pushing
|
the outside of the envelope”] it would be assumed that
|
some person, product, or event was not performing as
|
he, she, or it should. 2. n. A plan-by-time graph that
|
shows exponential growth, because of the end-of-year
|
panic by sales people with unfulfilled quotas.
“Well
|
folks, we just made it last year, but this time we must
|
straighten the banana curve.”
[This usage probably
|
derives from misunderstanding the earlier usage.]
banana label n. The curved label stuck to magnetic
tape reels and intended to identify the contents.
It
usually contains only a large number and some arbitrary
audit information.
banana problem n. Not knowing when to stop.
This
derives from the story about the child who said “I know
how to spell ‘banana’, but I don’t know when to stop”.
Used, for example, when trying to decide how far to
refine a design.
banner n. Several lines of boiler plate at the beginning
of a file (such as a forum) indicating its security classi-
fication.
Usually sufficiently large that it obscures the
useful information normally placed at the start of a file
– especially irritating when trying to browse such a file
when connected via a slow communication line. On PC
software, the banner takes the form of the display of a
giant logo and copyright notice, which usually cannot be
bypassed.
. bathtub curve n. A curve, very much the shape of a
.
Victorian bathtub, that characterises the failure rates of
.
components with time: initially high, dropping to a very
.
low level, then rising again at the end of the
.
component’s life. See also burn-in.
. baud n. The speed of a communications line, expressed
.
in “raw” state changes per second (not necessarily bina-
.
ry). [Not an IBM term, but included here as it is often
.
thought, by IBMers and others, to describe the actual
.
data rate achievable – which can be wildly optimistic (as
.
it includes any protocol bits, error checking bits, etc.) or
.
pessimistic (as some schemes can encode more than one
.
bit in a state change).]
Beamer, Beemer 1. n. An obvious IBM employee. A
person who works for IBM and wears his badge in
public, outside of any IBM building – or even further
afield.
May also wear white socks.
This is the
“outside” definition for a stereotyped IBM person; a
local radio show in the Hudson Valley features a spot
called “The Beemertons”, a kind of IBM soap opera.
2. n. In the USA: a brand of motor car, from the
Bayerische Motoren Werke.
bean counter 1. n. A person whose job is to find flaws
in reports dealing with financial matters.
According to
popular lore, if no mistakes are detected then this person
has the job of changing accounting procedures in order
to generate some mistakes. 2. n. An individual who
refuses to accept any proposal to improve a product (or
the work environment) unless it can be quantitatively
equated to a monetary reduction in corporate expendi-
tures, or a short-term increase in corporate revenues.
3. n. A person who insists that an employee be at his
desk by 08:30 precisely.
(Even though this means that
he must rise an hour earlier in order to catch an earlier
train than the one that would get him to his desk at
08:33.)
bed See get in bed with.
bells and whistles n. Frills added to a program or
product to make it more exciting without making it
much better.
belly up adj. Broken, not functioning (as for dead fish).
Used to refer to a piece of hardware that was function-
ing, but has ceased to do so.
(This adjective is most
commonly heard at the most critical point of the final
test cycle.)
Often used in the form “To go belly up”.
See also casters up mode, down.
. best-of-breed adj. Comparable to recently announced
.
competitive products. This term is used by planners and
.
enthusiasts, when a product is first proposed, to describe
.
the relationship of a product to its competition.
Not
.
used in later phases because (by then) the competition
.
has improved and at the same time many of the nicer
.
features of the new product have been removed due to
.
schedule pressures.
. beta test v. To test a pre-release [potentially unreliable]
.
version of a piece of software by making it available to
.
selected customers and users.
This term derives from
.
the early (1960s) IBM product cycle checkpoints, now
.
replaced by inspections and explicit test phases. “Alpha
.
Test” corresponds to today’s Unit or Component Tests;
|
“Beta Test” was the Ship Test (system test).
These
|
“greek letter” assignments were in turn derived from the
|
earlier A, B, and C tests for hardware.
The A-test was
|
a check that the idea for the product was feasible and
|
that the technology was available and could be manufac-
|
tured. Once passed, the product could proceed to design
|
and development.
The B-test was the most significant
|
checkpoint: it showed that the engineering model (often
|
just an advanced prototype) could run and perform as
|
specified.
The C-test was a repeat of the B-test on the
|
first few production machines. The term “Beta Test” is
.
now widely used throughout the computer software
.
industry.

bible n. A master reference document (for example, the
System/370 Principles of Operation).
“I don’t believe
that Divide sets the condition code – I’ll check it in the
Bible.”
BiCapitalization n. The PracTice of PutTing CapiTal
LetTers in the MidDle of WorDs.
This was originally
used to refer to microcomputer software trademarks such
as VisiCalc, EasyWriter, and FileCommand but has
since spread even to products totally unrelated to
computing, and to many more than two capitals.
The
mainframe world, however, is still mostly devoid of

viations is still the PMRR (Preferred Method of Reduc-
ing Readability).

does it do on BICARSA GLAPPR?”
Big Blue 1. n. IBM (when used by customers and
competitors).
2. n. The
Data
Processing
Division
(when used by people concerned with processors that do
not use the System/370 architecture).
[The DPD no

used to refer to large System/370 installations.]
Big Blue Zoo n. The manufacturing plant and laborato-
ry complex located at the junction of Highway 52 and
37th Street, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.
It really is

. big iron n. Large computers.
Also big iron bigot.
.
See iron.
Big OS (big ozz)
n. Operating System/360.
This term
was popular in the late ’60s when “OS” was the operat-
ing system, and it was believed to do and know every-
thing.
bigot n. A person with a passionate or religious (super-
stitious) fervour for a language or system.
As in: APL
bigot (q.v.), “REXX bigot”, “CMS bigot”.
Implies an
unwillingness to learn any alternative, except when the
term is used by one bigot to another (of the same type),
in which case the implication is almost affectionate.
Big Red Switch, BRS 1. n. A device for removing the
power from (and sometimes restoring it to) a computer.
Originally (1973) used to refer to the Emergency Power
Off switch on System/360 machines; now mainly used
to refer to the PC or PS/2 Power On/Off switch.
|
[Which, in the usual way of things, is no longer red on
|
the most recent machines.] On this machine, it is
commonly used to reset the machine when everything
else fails to bring the PC software back into a usable
state.
Using the BRS is also called “power cycling”.
.
See also Poughkeepsie reset, blue button. 2. v. To reset
.
or restart electrical machinery by raising the On/Off
.
switch (the Big Red Switch) to the Off position and then
.
returning it to the On position again [or vice versa,
.
down to the Off position, depending on the country of
.
origin of the machinery]. As in: “If Alt-Ctrl-Del doesn’t
.
work, you’ll need to BRS it”.
binary
aboriginal
n. Someone 
who 
programmed
computers before 1975.
A term of endearment, usually
identifying a programmer who:
a) Codes only in
assembler or even without one; b) Knows the original
reason why DISK DUMPed files have sequence
numbers; c) Dated or was dated by keypunch operators;
d) Knows what a core dump is; e) Graduated from
college with Mathematics or Electronics (Computer
Science did not exist then).
binary data n. Non-textual data (data that include char-
acters other than those normally recognisable when
printed).
All data in a computer are stored in binary
form, but some are more binary than others.
bit n. A single binary digit, which can have one of two
values, conventionally described as “0” or “1”.
A
contraction of “Binary Digit”.
Most computers use, at
the fundamental electronic level, a binary representation
of data.
bit-bucket 1. n. A notional bottomless hole into which
vital messages and files fall when some network
machine accidentally destroys them.
A useful excuse
for anything one has forgotten to send (“Oh, it must
have fallen into the bit-bucket.
I’ll send it again.”) or
did not feel like answering at the time (“Send it to me
again...”).
See also backbone. 2. n. A similar place, in
a processing unit, for unwanted information.
Here, in
hardware, the bit bucket collects all the leftover interme-
diate products of a calculation for disposal.
In large
high-performance machines, a “byte-bucket” or a “word-
bucket” must be used because the bit-bucket cannot be
|
emptied quickly enough. 3. v. To reject, cancel, or
|
throw away.
As in: “We’ve decided to bit-bucket this
|
release”.
bit decay n. The tendency of programs to start failing as
they get older, due to changes in the underlying environ-
ment or operating system.
. black hole 1. n. A person or customer of enormous
.
capacity who can drain the entire resources of an
.
organisation (such as a branch office). 2. n. A node on
.
a store-and-forward network that seems to be better at
.
storing files than at forwarding them. Usage: “IBMVM
.
updates are caught in the KGNGATE black hole”.
| black layer n. Hardware. See layer.
blank 1. n. A character, printed as a space, and often
mistaken for the absence of a character.
This typically
results in its being ignored or discarded.
(If you can’t
see it, it isn’t there, right?
It’s virtual).
VM was the
first major IBM operating system to use the blank as the
primary delimiter in its command language. See also
null. 2. adj. Of a page in a manual: containing only the
top title, page number, footing, and the words “This
Page Intentionally Left Blank”.
The most valuable
blank pages also contain the rubric “IBM Confidential”
(or something similar).
blem n. Problem.
Derived from Pro-blem (and possibly
Blemish).
Any bug or problem.
For example: “We’ve
encountered a number of blems in the scheduler.
We
might have to do a total redesign”.
blivet n. An intractable problem, or a design that can no
longer be enhanced or brought up-to-date.
Something
becomes a blivet when it is out of control. This usually
refers to a program that has been touched by so many
incompetent programmers that it cannot be maintained
properly.
From the World War II military term mean-
ing “ten pounds of manure in a five-pound bag”.
blow away v. To destroy. “The editor crashed and blew
away all my files.”

blue 
bogey
blue n. The official IBM company colour, Oxford blue.
There was once a blue letter on Blue on the HONE
system, which said that “...the feature number 9063
(Blue for all System/370 CPUs and peripherals, called
‘classic blue’) will have a slightly changed hue which
can lead to colour mismatch in customer machine
rooms.
Requests to repaint to the old hue are not
accepted”. See also all-blue, Big Blue.
bluebird n. A sale that comes in through the window,
that has not been “worked for”. For example, a hitherto
unknown customer walks in and orders a complete
System/370.
In India, they may be known as “Fairy
Bluebirds”.
blue button 1. n. The System/360 or System/370
combination Reset and IPL button.
2. v. To press the
Blue Button.
Used when a system or program fails to
respond to any console command and is somewhere out
in never-never land. See also Big Red Switch.
. blue cable n. The new (thinner) cable required for IBM
.
mainframe computer connections that run at 4.5 Mega-
.
bytes per second.
The official name is Reduced Diam-
.
eter Channel Cable. See also boa.
blue dot n. A small blue paper disk attached to the
door-frame of an office to indicate a member of the
cognoscenti. This curious emblem evolved at Yorktown
as a means to avoid the disordering of one’s office (by
security personnel) if one forgot to lock the door on
leaving (for any reason).
A verse from BLUEDOT
SONG explains all: “So here’s the algorithm that our
expert has computed:
/ A blue dot means your office
will be locked instead of looted. / By this device we
hope to end the practice we’ve protested, / So you can
leave your desk alone and not have it molested.”
blue glue n. SNA (Systems Network Architecture).
That which binds blue boxes together (official defi-
nition).
| blue layer n. Systems control (operating system) soft-
|
ware. See layer.
blue letter n. The document once distributed by the
Data Processing Division to announce a new product or
education course.
So named because it was printed on
blue paper, it contained the generalised product
description and the specifications that were used to
make the marketing representatives experts. When DPD
became NAD (National Accounts Division), NMD
(National Marketing Division), and ISG (Information
Systems Group), the blue letters changed colour (as did
the Peach Letters of the Small Systems announcements).
They are now all printed on ivory coloured paper (called
buff or bleach [Blue and Peach] by some).
It is now
fashionable to call the letters “Ivory Letters” to illustrate
one’s ability to change with the times, but real data
processing old-timers will invariably refer to them as
Blue Letters. See also announce.
blue money n. Internal budget dollars, used to purchase
an item from another IBM organisation.
This is used
mainly by product planners.
Its corollary is real
money (or, in the monochrome USA, green money),
which is needed to buy things from the outside world.
Real dollars are worth much more than blue dollars, and
nothing can stop a proposal faster than pointing out how
many real dollars it will cost.
Alternatively, a proposal
is much more likely to be approved if “the total cost is
all blue dollars”. See also funny money.
blue sky adj. Not inhibited by practicality, possibility,
politics, or popular trends.
For example: “A computer
system that is actually Easy To Use?
That’s real blue
sky!” See WIBNI.
| blue solution n. A system to solve a customer’s partic-
|
ular requirement or application that uses only IBM hard-
|
ware and software.
| bluespeak n. The language and jargon used by IBMers,
|
especially when the jargon is different from that used by
|
those employed by other companies.
For example,
|
DASD or file (others use disk). See also IBMJARG.
blue suiter 1. n. Someone from a more formally-
[over-?] dressed part of the IBM culture.
That is: a)
IBM marketing representative (when used by those at
HQ); b) IBMers at HQ (when used by those in a devel-
opment laboratory); or c) IBMers not at Research (when
.
used by those at Research). 2. n. An Officer in the
.
United States Air Force.
(When used by an IBMer at
.
the original Westlake location, in California, which used
.
to be visited by many USAF personnel.
As that
.
Westlake is now defunct, these now trek to Boulder
.
instead.)
blue wire n. A fix (correction) to a hardware card.
Required to repair damage accidentally caused by delet-
ing a pin while installing an Engineering Change. Also
used if the EC team runs out of yellow wire.
See also
purple wire.
boa n. One of the big fat cables that connect the parts of
a computer and lurk under the raised floor of all large
computer installations.
Possibly so called because they
display a ferocious life of their own when you try to lay
them straight and flat after they have been coiled for
some time.
It is rumoured that System/370 channel
cables are limited to 200 feet because beyond that length
the boas get dangerous.
(Also note that one maker of
computer cables in the USA is the Anaconda Copper
Company.)
board games 1. n. Exercises played by the designers
of any new keyboard (not just IBM’s!) in order to retain
an advantage over the end
users.
The schemes
employed can be so perverse that they defy belief at
times. 2. n. Invisible decisions taken by members of
some board or committee, usually with all-too-visible
results.
| board wirer (bored wire-er)
n. An early breed of
|
programmer who programmed accounting machines of
|
various kinds by patching connection wires into a plug
|
board. See grey elephant.
. boat anchor n. A hardware project or tool that, despite
.
the investment of resources far beyond the original
.
budget and schedule estimates, fails to meet even mini-
.
mal objectives.
Applied especially to “heavy” equip-
.
ment.
Boca n. Short for Boca Raton, the Fatherland of the PC
(and a favourite venue for business meetings during first
quarter).
It should be noted that most of the buildings
in that area are in fact in Delray Beach. Also note that
Boca Raton (the mouse’s mouth) got its name from the
pirates who harboured there, because of the safety
afforded by the dangerous reefs in the channel.
[Note:
raton seems to be the Spanish for “mouse”, not “rat”
(which is rata).]
Boca West n. One of the IBM locations at Austin,
Menlo Park, or Tucson.
The actual designation varies
from day to day depending upon the mood at the head-
quarters of the Entry Systems Division.
. bogey n. A target, especially a difficult or unpleasant
.
one.
This is used during planning cycles when head-
.
count or budget allocations are being cut.
The new
.
target is referred to as a “bogey” and is the value that
.
has to be matched in order to be within the authorised
.
resource limits.
“We are still three headcount over
.
bogey in ’87!” Probably from the golfing term (usually
.
one stroke over par on a hole), with overtones of the

.
1940s slang term for enemy aircraft.
Also dollar
.
bogey, a budget limit.
. bogue, boge (rhymes with rogue)
adj. Of an idea or
.
project: having little merit. From “bogus”.
boiler plate n. Content-free portions of a presentation
included to capture the attention and otherwise distract
the listener from any real issues. Also applied to stand-
ard parts of a document or program that contain little
information (copyright notices, for example).
boil the ocean v. To attempt something too ambitious.
This phrase is used to throw (cold) water on something
the speaker perceives as an overly ambitious proposal,
even though no technical case can be built for disap-
proval.
For example: “Your problem is that you’re
trying to boil the ocean”.
.
This phrase dates from World War II, when Axis
.
submarines were severely damaging Allied shipping.
.
The story goes that a high level naval meeting was held
.
to discuss the problem, during which an admiral
.
suggested the solution of boiling the ocean to force the
.
submarines to the surface. Everyone thought this was a
.
wonderful idea, except for one relatively junior officer,
.
who asked how this was to be done.
The admiral
.
replied: “I gave you the idea, it’s your job to work out
.
the details!”
bomb v. A synonym for crash.
(In the USA only – to
other English speakers the word conveys the opposite
meaning when used descriptively, as in: “That sports car
goes like a bomb!”)
BOOF (rhymes with aloof)
n. Byte-Oriented Operand
Feature.
An extension to the System/360 architecture
that permits references to data objects on arbitrary byte
boundaries.
This is a hardware “feature” introduced
with System/370 that, although a boon to the lazy
programmer, effectively removed an important debug-
ging facility (a specification interruption for alignment
errors) of the System/360 architecture.
For a consider-
able performance penalty, program errors are now
.
hidden from the programmer.
Originally designed to
.
meet a new requirement for FORTRAN standards (in the
.
standard, FORTRAN COMMON declarations were
.
defined as being allocated with no intervening space for
.
alignment).
Also implemented (’tis said) for the
convenience of programmers of Access Method modules
who were faced with the problems of external data not
falling on proper memory-aligned boundaries when read
into main memory.
[BOOF was sometimes called
BOO, as on the Model 195 it was not a feature, and
was therefore always available.] See feature.
. Bookie
n. The familiar name for BookMaster, a
.
document-formatting product based on the ISIL tool
.
(which was used for producing most IBM publications
.
before it became Bookie). [You bet it looks nice!] This
.
nickname came about not only because it’s shorter than
.
the real name, but also because one of the names
.
originally proposed for the product was “BookMaker”.
boondoggle 1. n. A conference (or other meeting that
involves travelling) with an admixture of both pleasure
and business. To be a true boondoggle, the trip must be
paid for by IBM.
To be a super-boondoggle, it should
be to Southern France, Florida, or anywhere in the
Caribbean. 2. n. A group of people, often a task force,
getting paid but doing nothing productive for a related
group – or for corporate revenue.
They may look and
act and sound very busy.
| boot, bootstrap 1. n. A program used to start up a
|
computer.
From the expression “to raise oneself by
|
one’s own bootstraps”.
Early IBM computers were
|
started by pressing the blue LOAD button. This simply
|
made the machine read one card into memory and then
|
branch to the memory location where that card image
|
had been placed.
The first card, therefore, had to
|
contain all the instructions necessary to get the machine
|
to read the next card or cards (as required) which
|
contained the rest of the program which in turn, when
|
complete, could then read in the production program or
|
(later) the operating system.
This initial, bootstrap,
|
program typically took two or three cards (160–240
|
bytes) and hence was called a boot deck.
An early
|
computer sport was the writing of one-card self-loading
|
production programs; an 80-80 listing (q.v.) was possible
|
for the IBM 1401. 2. v. To start up a computer, using a
|
bootstrap program. Also, in general, to start or restart a
|
computer operating system.
In the sixties, and even on
|
today’s mainframes, this was done by pressing the blue
|
button. See also Big Red Switch, IPL.
bottom line n. A term used (mostly by managers) to
reveal a strong desire to bypass understanding of a
proposed solution in favour of a simplistic quantification
of it.
Probably a reference to the totals line at the
bottom of financial reports.
As in: “I don’t want all
these pros and cons, just give me the bottom line”.
Higher level managers may interchange use of this term
with net it out (q.v.).
box 1. n. A piece or collection of hardware large
enough to form a free-standing unit. “The Mass Storage
|
Subsystem was an interesting box.” This term is often
|
used when the term “unit” may be ambiguous.
For
|
example, in a 3380E disk unit there are four disks and
|
eight access arms.
Saying that the 3380E can hold
|
about 8GBytes per “unit” can be misleading if the
|
listener confuses “units” with access arms (which corre-
|
spond to one I/O address each) or to disks (which have
|
two I/O addresses each). 2. v. To isolate a piece of
|
equipment from the rest of the system for diagnostic
|
tests.
See fence out. 3. v. To put in a packing box
|
(because the equipment has broken or has become obso-
|
lete – in the latter case pine boxes are preferred).
| boxology n. The art of drawing pretty diagrams using
|
the “box” characters (actually box part characters) in
|
monospace 
fonts.
Also 
known 
as 
character
|
graphics.
bracket n. A collection of messages.
This term is an
invention in IBM communications, and part of the
Systems Network Architecture. A bracket is a group of
messages exchanged between two communicating parties
that is deemed to constitute a logically separate unit
such as a “transaction”.
Marker flags are sent with
certain messages to indicate the start or end of a brack-
et. Brackets offer plenty of scope for getting out of step
and 
producing 
nasty 
problems 
called 
“bracket
violations”.
brain check n. An error that occurs while presenting
information to a computer (or to another person) and
that is not caused by a simple keyboard entry error (cf.
finger check).
Often used in the following way: “Sorry
about that, but it was only a finger check, not a brain
check”.
brain dump n. An alternative term for core dump.
branch to Fishkill n. Similar to branch to Owego, but
starting in Poughkeepsie.
branch to Owego n. Any unexpected jump in a
program which produces catastrophic or just plain weird
results. This phrase originated in Endicott, which is just
down the road from the rival Owego (Federal Systems
Division) site. For example: “Ah ha! My base register
got clobbered: that made the program take a branch to
Owego!”
For the record, the name Owego comes from ah-we-
ga, an Indian name meaning “where the river widens”.

brass tag
build-to-plan
brass tag n. A small plate (originally made of brass,
but now usually made of self-adhesive plastic) that
shows the IBM serial number (stock number) of a piece
of (non-IBM) capital equipment.
It was considered a
serious offence to remove the brass tag from a piece of
equipment, though readers report that they sometimes
kept as a souvenir the brass tag from a much-loved
machine when it was scrapped.
breakage n. The extra people that must be added to an
organisation because the action plan has changed. Every
planned change causes breakage – usually more than
unplanned changes.
| breakthrough n. A solution to a challenge (q.v.) which
|
had no obvious resolution.
Usage: “This is your goal;
|
we need a breakthrough”.
| brick n. A Digital Communication System (DCS) Port-
|
able Terminal (PT) used by most US IBM NSD
|
Customer Engineers (CEs) to record and communicate
|
their activities and to send messages back and forth.
|
The technology has led to the current ARDIS offering.
|
The PT is about the size, and weight (0.8kg, 28oz), of a
|
brick and is equipped with an audio annunciator for
|
attracting attention.
Eack brick is capable of operating
|
in RF (Radio Frequency) mode or TELCO (Telephone
|
Company) mode.
In RF mode it is linked, via a
|
network of remote antennae, to one of the 12 Area
|
Communication Centers (ACCs) throughout the US
|
which receive customer service calls.
In TELCO mode
|
the CE dials into the ACC directly.
Bricks distinguish
.
IBM Customer Engineers from service representatives
.
from other firms (who carry mere pagers).
bridge n. Unsubstantiated facts used to explain one set
of data in terms of another.
A bridging exercise is a
procedure whereby one takes two different and some-
times independently generated sets of information,
usually numbers, and relates them in some way to
explain the differences.
Upon being presented with a
set of data, the manager making a decision involving
that data usually asks for a bridge from the current set
to the last acceptable set of data. Generally the bridging
exercise is unnecessary for anyone involved in the deci-
sion, but the need for a bridge provides the manager
with a convenient excuse to delay the decision.
“I
cannot make a decision on that without a bridge to the
last estimate.” The most useful bridge is so comprehen-
sive that it is too complex to be understood by anyone
but the person who created it – and hence is ideal for
use in reports to higher levels of management.
. brimburn n. A confusion whose symptoms are reminis-
.
cent of a mild schizophrenia. A result of changing hats
.
too fast in a new position.
External symptoms include
.
the taking of the opposite side to that held in the previ-
.
ous position.
Especially prevalent in those newly
.
appointed to positions of responsibility.
Secondary
.
symptoms 
include 
an 
inclination 
towards
.
pronouncements such as “that is true, but you must
.
understand both sides”.
. bring the system to its knees v. To overload a
.
computer so that its response time is dramatically worse
.
(longer) than usual.
“Everything was fine until he
.
started to run MVS as a guest system – that’s what
.
brought the system to its knees.” See also thrash.
bring up n. To restart a system (usually by IPL) after a
failure or a normal period of disuse. To bring a system
to an operative (up) state. [A curious choice of phrase,
given some of its more common meanings.]
. bring up file n. A repository for information needed at
.
a later date. Usage: “Let’s put that request in the bring
.
up file”.
. BRS v. See Big Red Switch.
btw (by-th’way)
abbreviation. By The Way. An abbre-
viation used in electronic mail to speed typing, and
hence properly entered in lowercase.
Also obtw, “Oh
By The Way”. See also wrt.
Bubblegum n. The Boeblingen Laboratory, in Germany.
Americans have four alternatives in trying to pronounce
“Boeblingen”: a) BO-BLING-GEN makes you sound as
if you have never heard the word spoken and are clearly
“out of it”; b) BER-BLING-GEN (the most popular
variant) sounds as if you KNOW what it sounds like but
cannot pronounce it yourself (probably true); c)
BOB-LING-GEN seems to be a favourite in New York
State; d) the correct pronunciation leaves you open to
accusations of intellectual snobbery by the other groups.
Calling it “Bubblegum” defuses the whole issue by
attempting to make it a joke.
bucket n. A collection; usually a collection of programs,
tests, or fixes.
“Please send me the bucket for release
3.” See also bit-bucket, regression bucket, test bucket.
buck slip n. A routing slip listing the names of the
members of a department.
Used to make the loss of
correspondence (or delay in delivery) more organised.
bug n. A very broad term denoting a defect in either
hardware or software.
Some bugs can be detected and
may interfere with customer (or IBM) use of the prod-
uct.
Other bugs may lie dormant and hatch for a
Watson’s Law event. Much effort is and will continue to
be spent forcing bugs to the surface and removing them
or otherwise eliminating any ill effects they cause. The
ultimate management question is “Have you really
removed the last bug from our product?”
The required
workers’ reply is “Oh, surely we have found the last
bug?!”, delivered in unison.
[This is not an IBM term,
.
having been in use since 1889 or earlier, but is included
here for completeness and cross-references.]
build v. To assemble software or hardware systems.
This is used fairly conventionally for hardware (as in
“build a new CPU”), but is used far more carelessly
when describing software systems.
When all the
components of a large program are assembled together
to make a whole, the process is called building.
If the
resulting system is large and complex, the verb is often
elevated to the status of a noun, as in: “Let’s start test-
ing the new build”.
| build plan n. A proposed or committed schedule for the
|
completion and assembly of a software system.
See
|
also build.
. build-to-order adj. Of a hardware product: manufac-
.
tured, or to be manufactured, following customer orders.
.
Often, some special feature (like frame doors of the
.
proper colour) is unavailable – which leads to long
.
delivery delays.
Sometimes, however, special orders
.
can be processed more rapidly than those for mass-
.
produced (build-to-plan) items, which can have a large
.
backlog.
It is reported that when 3380 disk units were
.
scarce (in 1984/5), an internal customer mistakenly
.
ordered brown 3380s (which are BTO models) rather
.
than the standard blue/White variety.
Much to their
.
surprise, the units were delivered two months later;
.
other departments had been waiting for their blue ones
.
for more than a year.
. build-to-plan adj. Of a hardware product: manufac-
.
tured, or to be manufactured, independently of customer
.
orders.
Since forecasts (on which the plan was based)
.
have the knack of being inaccurate, this technique can
.
lead to delivery delays or overfilled warehouses. See
.
build-to-order.

bullet 
card
bullet n. One of a list of items to be emphasised, usually
marked by a blob (bullet) alongside it on a foil.
“And
the next bullet is absolutely vital...”. See also key.
bulletize v. To convert a proposal, argument, or result
into a list of items for a foil (which may or may not be
preceded by bullets).
Implies extracting the essence of
an argument, but in reality means emphasising the most
politically acceptable items from a proposal.
Bunch n. When RCA and General Electric dropped out
of the computer business, the Seven Dwarves became
the rather less romantic “Bunch”.
(Burroughs, Univac,
.
NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell).
In 1986, this
.
grouping changed again due to the merger of Burroughs
.
and Sperry-Univac to form Unisys – no follow-on to the
.
term seems to have arisen.
[Not to be confused with
Baybunch – the San Francisco Bay IBM user group.]
. buns on seats n. A measurement of sales performance
.
peculiar to regional sales staff departments (“Customer
.
Centers”). Rather than sales dollars, which are difficult
.
to attribute to a regional sheep dip session, the staff
.
count the number of people who attend mass-marketed
.
seminars.
Staff members sometimes suspect each other
.
of inviting relatives and the unemployed, with promises
.
of Costa Rican coffee and mock-Danish pastries.
| burden n. The additional costs, or overhead, above an
|
employee’s salary that when added to the salary make
|
up the true cost of an employee to the company. Typi-
|
cally (but rather dependent on the country of employ-
|
ment) the burden is approximately equal to salary.
| Burlington South n. The East Fishkill location, in New
|
York State.
burn v. To make a copy. “If you can wait a minute, I’ll
.
burn one for you.” The term is used both by engineers
.
(when copying a programmable read-only memory
.
(PROM), which requires the melting of fusible links in
.
the circuitry) and by others when copying papers. This
.
latter usage can be dated to the late 1950s, when the
.
dominant method of making copies was “Thermofax”.
.
This process used infra-red radiation to transfer copies
.
to heat-sensitive paper. See also ibmox.
. burn-in v. To “condition” a piece of hardware (especial-
.
ly an integrated circuit) by running it for some time
.
(often at an unusually high temperature).
Many of the
.
failures in computer equipment occur when it is first
.
used: burning-in is an effective technique for ensuring
.
that these occur before the equipment is used for a crit-
.
ical task. See also bathtub curve.
burn sand v. To personalize EPROMs or gate arrays,
programming them by electrically blowing (burning-out)
fusible links on the silicon chips.
Usage: “We need to
ensure that low level design is complete before we
commit to burn sand”.
business case 1. n. Economic (commercial) justifica-
tion.
Asking for the business case is an effective wet
blanket to throw on most hot projects. 2. v. To make
such a justification.
As in: “Sorry, Joe, we are still
business-casing that project”.
buzz word quotient, BWQ n. The proportion of words
in a conversation or document that are buzz words
(jargon words). For example, if every fourth word in a
conversation is a buzz word, it has a BWQ of 0.25 or
25%.
byte (bite)
n. One character of information, almost
always consisting of eight binary digits (bits). In nearly
all True Blue computers, a Byte is realised as more than
eight bits – the extra bits (or parts of bits) being used
for error checking. The term “Byte” originated in 1956
during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch
computer.
Originally it was described as consisting of
from one to six bits (typical Input/Output equipment of
the period used 6-bit chunks of information). The move
to an 8-bit byte for Stretch happened in late 1956, and
this was the size later adopted and immortalised by the
System/360. The term was coined by mutating the word
“bite” so it would not be accidentally misspelt as “bit”.
See also nybble.
. BYTE8406 
(bite-eighty-four-oh-six)
v. To 
start 
a
.
discussion about old IBM machines. See also forum.
BYTE8406 syndrome 1. n. The tendency for any
social discussion among computer people to drift
towards exaggeration.
“Well, when I started using
computers they didn’t even use electricity yet, much
less transistors.” See forum. 2. n. The tendency for
oppression to waste resources.
Derives from the obser-
vation that “erasing a banned public file does not
destroy the information, but merely creates an uncounta-
ble number of private copies”. It was first diagnosed in
September 1984, when the BYTE8406
forum was
removed from the IBMPC Conference.
cable together v. To assemble a system on an ad hoc
basis.
“They just cabled together whatever boxes they
could find.” [A pun on “cobble together”.]
cabling system n. A new wiring standard that is
intended to allow the interconnection of all IBM termi-
nals, PCs, and communication devices.
It is also the
physical support of the token ring (q.v.).
Installing it
should relieve systems administration personnel from the
boredom generated by the over-familiar coax wiring.
| cache n. An area of memory, usually faster or more
|
readily accessible than the rest of the memory, that is
|
used to hold instructions or data that are (or are
|
expected to be) referred to frequently. First used in the
|
IBM System/360 Model 85 (1968).
| la cage aux foils n. The European Headquarters build-
|
ing, the Tour Pascal in Paris.
Perhaps a pun on cage
|
aux folles, a madhouse. See also foil, Foil Factory.
calendarize v. To put an appointment into one’s calen-
dar.
This expression replaces the more traditional
idiom,
pencil in, in the sentence “let me pencil that in
for Thursday”.
call-taker n. An instructor in a marketing education
class who takes on the role of a customer taking a call
from the (trainee) Marketing Representative.
In this
scenario, an inexperienced student pretends to be a
seasoned rep while an inexperienced instructor pretends
to be a customer.
Full of imagination, they both sit in
an interview room, making believe that it has long been
a business office, and earnestly engage in an attempt to
satisfy a hypothetical customer requirement by discuss-
ing pieces of equipment which neither has ever seen or
used.
The student is assessed on his or her ability to
continue to breathe while fumbling through notes and
brochures. The instructor (call-taker) is judged on his or
her ability to stay awake after playing the same role
twelve times a day.
candy-striped adj. Registered IBM Confidential (q.v.).
Refers to the Red and White diagonal markings on the
covers of such documents. Also used as a verb: “Those
figures have been candy-striped”.
card 1. n. A piece of cardboard about 90mm by 215mm
that held information which was encoded by patterns of
small rectangular holes punched through the cardboard.
The standard IBM (Hollerith) card was made the same
size as paper currency of the day, and held 80 columns
of data encoded as one character per column (though
many other kinds of coding scheme were used).
Other
sizes of card were also used, with either rectangular or
circular holes.
The standard 80-column card still influ-
ences IBM products, and indeed the whole computer
industry; for example, displays commonly allow 80
characters in a row, and many reference documents
(especially “Quick Reference Cards”) have similar

dimensions to a punched card.
See also chip, green
card, spindle. 2. n. An electronic printed circuit board.
“The problem determination procedure lets all faults be
isolated to a single card.”
. card-holding manager n. A manager who manages
.
employees (rather than one, such as a program manager,
.
who is a manager in title only).
Until recently, the
.
personnel profile of an employee was recorded on a
.
computer card; this was held by the manager of that
.
employee. See manager.
career develop v. To promote or move to another job,
especially if the employee is not entirely happy with the
change.
Usage: “We should career develop Jack; he’s
too bright for the rest of the team.”
career limiting remark n. An undiplomatic comment
directed at one’s manager, or at one’s manager’s manag-
er.
. carriage control character n. A character, usually in
.
the first column of each line of a file, that controls the
.
way in which the line is to be printed.
Originally, this
.
character controlled the movement of the printer carriage
.
almost directly.
Nowadays it is usually processed by
.
software to produce some indirect effect. See also skip
.
to channel one.
| carrier product n. The first product that includes an
|
implementation of some new feature of an architecture,
|
especially of SAA (q.v.).
carve up the business v. To divide up and parcel out
management responsibilities.
Most often used at the
headquarters level: “After we carve up the business we
will know where we stand”.
| cascade v. To distribute information rapidly, using a
|
hierarchy of presentations by senior managers.
As in:
|
“Please cascade this to your people this week”.
casters up mode n. Complete breakdown, as in: “The
1130 is in casters up mode”.
Engineers’ equivalent of
the term “all four feet in the air”, referring to a piece of
hardware which is totally non-functional and of use to
neither person nor beast. See also down, belly up.
cast in concrete adj. Immutable.
Used when specifi-
cations are frozen and are therefore unchangeable. This
takes place a few days before the first prototype is avail-
able for general usability testing, so minimising the
work of the development group.
Effectively acts as a
wet blanket should further urgently needed changes be
proposed.
cast in jello adj. Not cast in concrete, still not firm or
decided. On some projects, describes any decision made
without management approval; on some others, any
decision. [“Jell-o” is a brand name, in the USA, for
gelatin-based desserts (usually fruit-flavoured).]
catalog
1. n. A
directory
of
files
in
an
operating
system.
2. n. A list of packages available on an auto-
matic software distribution service.
. catcher n. A program that executes at locations remote
.
from a central site and which receives and installs
.
programs and data from the central site.
A kind of
.
shadow (q.v.). The term comes from a North American
.
game called “baseball”. See pitcher.
caveat n. A warning, given during an oral presentation.
This is a communication technique, favoured in NCD,
that affords a presenter the opportunity to give an illu-
sion of speaking frankly and candidly to an audience.
Done well, the caveat will relax the defences of an
otherwise critical audience, lulling it into accepting the
token statement at face value. “The customer must first
effect an operational SNA environment.
This is not
always an easy task, but has been done in one day at
several accounts.”
Cave of the Winds n. The Divisional HQ at 1133
Westchester Avenue, White Plains, New York.
The
term refers to the famous cave of the same name, and
.
arose because of the poorly designed air-conditioning
.
system installed when the building was constructed.
.
The building is divided into three parts – a long centre
.
section and two ends.
Each part had its own air circu-
.
lation system (for heating and air-conditioning), and as a
.
result there were pressure differentials relative to the
.
outside – and between the various parts of the building.
.
There were large doors in the one aisle that connects the
.
different pieces, and pressures were equalised through
.
these doors. Offices near to the doors were most unde-
.
sirable due to the whistling of the winds, and small
.
people sometimes had trouble opening the doors against
.
the suction.
The name for the building has stuck, now
because of all the hot air alleged to circulate
spontaneously therein.
| CCITE (see-sight)
n. Cooperative Computing Internal
|
Technical Exchange, an internal conference that focuses
|
on the cooperation of different operating systems in
|
performing computing tasks. The first CCITE was held
|
in 1989 at the Almaden Research Center.
It replaced,
|
and follows in the traditions of, the VMITE conference
|
(q.v.).
center of competency, COC (see-oh-see)
n. A group
of people who claim to be experts in some particular
topic.
This title follows the name of many support
groups and development departments, and is almost
always self-bestowed.
The term suggests a level of
expertise, importance, and involvement generally not
associated with the group (hence the perceived need for
the title). Adding the COC tag to the function name of
any department automatically increases the headcount
and the travel budget of that department, but usually
without a proportional increase in competence.
central electronics complex, CEC (keck)
n. The
central processing unit (CPU) of a large computer
.
(“CEC” sounds more impressive than “CPU”).
This
.
term was prohibited by CYA enthusiasts in 1978, who
.
feared that the term would be trade-marked. In 1987 it
.
crept back into general use, both in connection with the
.
3090 (where it refers to the business end of the 3090
.
Processor Complex, i.e., everything except the support
.
bits such as the 3092, 3097 and 3089) and with the
.
System/88 (whose engineers refer to the number of CEC
.
slots in various chassis).
Chad Age n. The prehistory of computing [prior to
1975].
This is the dawn of the computer era, so called
from the myriads of fossilised small pieces of paper or
cardboard (chad) found in geological strata dating back
to the fifties and sixties.
Those remains were left by
one of our ancestors, the Homo Ibeehemerus Nuyorckus,
whose major dwellings can still be located along the
Hudson River Valley.
A reader recounts that in 1976 he worked in a U.S.
Navy message center that was still using paper tape for
all its traffic (thousands of messages a day). They used
several colours of paper tape, representing the various
classifications of the messages. A common trick to play
on newcomers was to have them separate classified chad
from unclassified chad – since all classified materials
had to be burned.
challenge n. Something difficult. A challenge is climb-
ing a mountain (or bottoming a cave) and is not related
to “work” at all.
In IBM this term is often mistakenly
used to mean “Big Problem”.
change control n. A method for documenting and
controlling the changes to a system or environment,
sometimes relying on pieces of paper.
One of the
System Management disciplines, from which DP centre

staff derive the warm feeling that they are in control of
their computer installation.
Often known sardonically
(by the users who must actually live with the insidious
overheads generated by the various implementations of
the discipline) as “blame control”.
Charlie letter n. An announcement letter for retail deal-
ers of IBM Personal Computer equipment.
This refers
to Charlie Chaplin, a comic actor whose portrayal of a
tramp was copied in IBM PC advertisements, much to
the delight of satirists.
charm school n. New Manager School.
Ambitious
careerpersons must learn to direct their friends instead of
swill ale, wine, or fruit juice with them.
It is observed
that some charm schools teach “ugly” instead of
“suave”.
chauffeur driven adj. Of a software system: developed
using a standard product that has had a new (usually
better) end user interface provided by an expert to hide
the original interface.
Also used to hide the extraor-
dinary number of options provided with much computer
software.
check n. A serious error.
From machine check.
A
check is an error deemed sufficiently serious that a light
(called a “check” light as it could be easily checked at a
glance) was lit on the front panel of the computer.
Usage: “The CPU took three checks before lunch”.
Also used for software (program checks). See hit.
checkbook programming systems n. A systems
group that hires an outside vendor to produce software
instead of having it written by IBM programmers.
A
group whose achievements are proportional to budget
rather than to skill or to talent.
| chicken book n. A gentle, user-friendly, introductory
|
guide to a piece of hardware or software.
Especially
|
used of the PC-DOS User’s Guide, so named because of
|
its pictures of “cute” chicken-like birds and perhaps
|
because its audience was expected to be timid and fear-
|
ful.
chiclet keyboard n. A keyboard whose keys are fabri-
cated from small rectangular pieces of rubber-like plastic
that look like pieces of chewing-gum [Chiclet is a
brand-name and a Spanish generic term for chewing-
gum]. Used to describe the original PCjr keyboard.
| chinese binary n. column binary (q.v.).
chip 1. n. The small rectangle of cardboard created by
punching a hole in a card.
See also Chad Age.
2. n. An integrated circuit.
One chip from a wafer of
silicon crystal. See also glass.
chiselled in granite adj. cast in concrete (q.v.).
Used
in the Eastern USA near the Granite Mountains of
Vermont.
chocolate adj. Enhanced flavour. That is, of a program:
modified and improved. 
Rare. 
See flavour, vanilla,
mocha. See also spinning chocolate.
| CI to C n. The standard “just list” wiring on programma-
|
ble accounting machines. See all cycles to list.
clean up 1. v. To improve a sloppy program, system, or
procedure by redesign or by rewriting sections of the
code. “We have to clean up the SPIE exit”. A cleanup
should convert decadence to elegance, and sometimes
does. 2. v. To recover space on a disk by erasing old or
redundant data.
CLIP (klip)
v. To change the (magnetic) pack label on a
DASD volume (disk pack).
The term CLIP stood for
Change Label Information Program.
Usually IPL’d
from cards, this program not only changed the serial
number but also other items in the volume label area.
These other capabilities were seldom used, so CLIPping
became synonymous with changing the volume serial
number.
. clone n. A copy of a computer (almost always an IBM
.
PC).
Imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flat-
.
tery; in recent years there have been few clones of other
.
manufacturers’ personal computers.
closed loop n. See loop.
| close of business n. End of the working day, typically
|
5pm local time.
| clutch point n. A periodic opportunity to do something.
|
As in “missing the clutch point”.
From the days of
|
mechanical card readers, which could only be activated
|
at one point in their mechanical cycle.
If the signal to
|
activate was too late, the controlling program had to
|
wait a full cycle before trying again.
coathanger n. A computer terminal given to a reluctant
old-timer IBM manager who does not believe in data-
processing.
This is used as a convenient object over
which to throw the animal fur coat in order to warm it
for wearing home.
COBOL programmer n. A person whose experience is
limited to commercial applications programming.
This
term, now rare, had negative connotations.
COBOL is
not highly regarded in IBM; few people in IBM choose
to program in the language.
code n. The statements, instructions, or binary represen-
tation of an algorithm or procedure.
Any program in
source or other form.
microcode is the lowest level of
software controlling a computer.
machine code is the
next level – the documented instruction set of a comput-
er. assembler Code is next, where symbolic names may
be used for the instructions. Object Code (see OCO) is
the result of compiling assembler (or higher) level
languages.
All other programming languages are other
more or less obscure ways of coding a clear algorithm
into something that a computer might understand, and
all programs are referred to as Code. This may also be
used as a verb, of course, and a coder may be seen
coding code. See also line of code.
code freeze n. The point of the development cycle after
which no further changes may be made to the code.
This freezing is needed so that the product is no longer
a “moving target” for those people trying to add the
final polish to documentation or sales brochures. It may
or may not be a true freeze – sometimes corrections and
bug fixes are still allowed.
Sometimes preceded by a
code slush.
code name n. The name used to designate a project (or
future product) to obscure the purpose of the project
from casual observers and other IBMers.
The code
name of an especially famous project can move into the
vernacular (for example, see Winchester). When a suit-
ably large number of IBMers know what is concealed
behind the code name, the product is announced in order
to change its name to a four-digit product number.
A
clever product manager always chooses a code name
which lends itself to a descriptive series, and hence
makes follow-ons a natural possibility.
For instance, a
project 
COLLIE 
might 
spawn 
a 
CHIHUAHUA
(wristwatch 
version) 
and 
a 
NEWFOUNDLAND
(mainframe version). See also announce, FCS.
. code triple point n. A code freeze that exists on paper,
.
or in someone’s imagination, but is not matched by real-
.
ity.
From the Physics term: the pressure and temper-
.
ature at which the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a
.
substance can co-exist.
Code at triple point similarly
.
exists in three phases: solid, fluid and vaporware.
coffee break n. An unscheduled failure in a computer
system.
Used to describe a stoppage or crash that
mysteriously occurs around the time that users or opera-
tors are in need of refreshment.
Also used to describe
any unexplained failure in a computer system.

coffee game
conferencing facility
coffee game n. A procedure followed to determine who
among a group of people is to pay for a round of cups
of (instant) coffee.
A religious ceremony practiced at
various IBM locations (notably the Glendale Laboratory
at Endicott, NY) in which groups of people play a
simple but skilful game of chance to stretch a five-
minute trip to the coffee machine into a half-hour break.
Coffee games often attract large followings, with the
most addicted devotees refusing to drink coffee unless it
has been properly played for. Games are usually played
among a set group of people, with a game taking place
every time anyone in the group develops a thirst.
Coffee gaming has developed its own special jargon.
This is outside the scope of this dictionary, being a
major research project in its own right, but some idea of
its flavour may be gleaned from the following: A “dip”
indicates that a person has lost a game, a “double dip”
is two losses in one day.
A “triple dip” is known as a
“Pat Mitchell Special”, in honour of a well-known
Endicott ice cream parlour. [Also used as a verb.]
cold pricklies n. A nagging suspicion that somewhere
one has overlooked something critical, and will be
punished for it. See warm fuzzies.
cold start n. A restart without restoring the previous
state of the operating system.
On VM, this causes the
loss of all spool files, and is therefore often used as an
excuse for a missing VNET file:
“You didn’t get the
memo I sent you?
There must have been a cold start
somewhere”.
Also used to designate problems in
resuming normal work: “After his week in Yosemite, he
had a two-day-long cold start”.
| column binary n. A scheme devised by the SHARE
|
user group, and implemented in the “SHARE Loader”,
|
for encoding binary data on punched cards in columns,
|
rather than in rows. The IBM 701, 704, 709, and 7090
|
computers read cards as rows of words, 9-edge first, two
|
36-bit words a row (in columns 1 through 72). With the
|
improved scheme, three columns (of 12 rows) were used
|
for each word.
As an early example of improving the
|
human interface to machines it was remarkably success-
|
ful, because it let users punch their patches relatively
|
easily on an IBM 010 or IBM 011 card punch.
| comeback meeting n. A meeting called by an Execu-
|
tive to follow-up on actions requested at an earlier meet-
|
ing.
“The comeback meeting to the Director is
|
scheduled for Tuesday 9th May.”
| come out of the bottle v. To become enraged, or to
|
make unreasonable demands.
As in: “When I told him
|
we wouldn’t have it ready until next week he came out
|
of the bottle”.
The proper term for appeasing someone
|
who has come out (or is out) of the bottle is “back in
|
the bottle”, as in “Have you got him back in the bottle
|
yet?”
The origin of this phrase is unconfirmed, but it
|
may be derived from the tale of the Fisherman and the
|
Genie in the Arabian Nights. See also uncork.
command language n. A set of magical incantations
that may be used to instruct a computer to perform
wondrous things. Can bring great blessings on the user;
but like all good magic, misuse or use by the ignorant
(see naive user) can bring great woe.
comment out 1. v. To make a section of source code
ineffective by putting it between comment separators.
This allows the effect of that code to be determined
empirically, by omitting it without actually destroying it;
a powerful and effective debugging technique. 2. v. To
make someone’s remark ineffective by making a nasty
comment about the remark (or his or her expertise).
commit plan n. See Fall Plan.
commit time n. (Used by some Field personnel.)
The
latest time when one can leave the IBM building on a
customer call without appearing to be leaving early for
home.
As in: “If I don’t leave for a customer location
before commit time, I have to stay until 5pm”.
commonality n. The common ground between two
plans or designs.
“OK, what’s the commonality
between your proposal and hers?”
communication n. The art of obscuring information
with jargon. The following example comes from a book
describing (appropriately enough) a communications
protocol: “All PIUs that have a DAF containing the
address of this LU and whose OAF matches the partner-
network-address field in an NLX associated with the
NLB for this LU are queued to the NLX that represents
this unique OAF and DAF pair.”
| The Company n. IBM (q.v.).
| compatibility box n. A subset, or mode, of OS/2 under
|
which PC-DOS programs can be run; effectively an
|
operating system within an operating system (though not
|
in the sense that VM allows).
The compatibility box
|
goes to great lengths to permit almost any PC-DOS
|
program to run in it.
It emulates a DOS 3.3 (or later)
|
system, in which old DOS 1.0 calls are still provided.
|
Since DOS 1.0 itself emulates parts of CP/M, some
|
CP/M programs theoretically can still be run under
|
OS/2. See also penalty box.
compatible 1. adj. Sufficiently similar to some other
piece of hardware or software (often an earlier release of
the same product) that moving from one to the other is
relatively painless.
Note that the movement, like strok-
ing a dogfish, is unpleasant in either direction, but is
especially so in the direction not intended by the design-
.
er. See also follow-on. 2. adj. Not compatible.
As in:
.
“A compatible subset, with extensions”.
computer security audit n. The day on which an
independent security audit team descends on a location
and attempts to find the security problems in the
computer system there. This is either a) the day before
which all passwords are changed and confidential files
encrypted [best case], or b) the day after which all pass-
words are changed and confidential files encrypted
[worst case].
concern n. A formal indication from one group to
another that the first is (very) worried about some action
by the other. To start a communication with the words
“I have a concern with your...” is a sure way to cool a
friendship. See issue, non-concur.
concur v. To give an irrevocable (often written) agree-
ment.
“Product Assurance concur (that the product be
shipped)”.
conference cronies n. The 10% of contributors who
produce 90% of the contributions to a conferencing facili-
ty.
. conference disk n. A disk containing documents (files)
.
that are mostly forums, which are managed by a confer-
.
encing facility.
conferencing facility n. A service machine that allows
data files to be shared among many people and places.
These files are typically forums on particular subjects,
which can be added to by those people authorised to
take part in the conference.
This allows anyone to ask
questions of the user community and receive public
answers from it. The growth rate of a given conferenc-
ing facility is a good indication of IBMers’ interest in its
topic.
The three largest conferences are the IBMPC,
IBMVM, and IBMTEXT conferences, which hold thou-
sands of forums on matters relating to the PC, VM, and
text processing, respectively. These are all open to any
VNET user. See also append, forum, service machine.

conscience 
crit sit
| conscience n. Person responsible for a task.
As in:
|
“You are my conscience regarding the integrity of that
|
plan”.
A favourite among younger senior managers
|
with regard to experienced members of their staff. The
|
term implies a deference to the skills of the other, and
|
also a certain delegation of responsibility.
. content n. The central ideas of a document, as distin-
.
guished from its “style” or “layout”. When a document
.
is sent out for review it is understood that one is to
.
review its content, rather than its presentation.
(And if
.
one can figure out what the author meant to say then the
.
content is better than average.)
control unit n. A piece of hardware that controls a
number of one type of peripheral unit, such as displays,
tape drives, or disks.
A control unit is supposed to
relieve the main processing unit from the more menial
tasks involved in managing the peripherals. For display
terminals, especially, it may also have an uncanny abili-
ty to increase system overhead time (and hence response
time) by several hundred percent.
converge v. To take two dissimilar projects and gradu-
ally change or evolve both of them until they can be
replaced by a single project or product.
A concept
drawn from non-Euclidean geometry, wherein parallel
(or even diverging) lines are seen to intersect.
As in:
“Let’s keep both projects going and converge them in
Release 3”.
cookbook, cook-book 1. n. Some official document
which exemplifies the bureaucracy involved in getting a
product out of the door. For example, a CTP (Compre-
hensive Test Plan).
Also used as an affectionate term
(like bible, q.v.) for some master reference document.
2. adj. Describing (in great detail) a procedure for a
person to follow, down to what commands to type, and
when. As in: “This guide has a cookbook description of
IPLing a system”.
cook chips v. To produce multilayer chips for use in
complex modern computers. This refers to the process-
ing of the silicon wafers, which involves repeated
baking in special ovens.
| co-op n. Co-operative education student.
Usually a
|
college student, in the USA, who works for IBM for a
|
term (semester), and sometimes longer.
Co-ops very
|
often get good and interesting projects to work on, but
|
the short straw can be mundane work such as making an
|
inventory of ceiling tiles.
| cooperative processing n. Processing carried out in
|
two or more places, usually a personal computer (or
|
workstation) and a larger “host” computer.
There is an
|
implication of close execution interlocks between the
|
parts of a single application. Coined circa 1985.
core n. The main memory of a computer.
Usage: “Is
the transient in core at the time ?”
A reference to the
ferrite cores employed as the main storage medium for
early computers, rather than a synonym for “central”. In
faddish circles people sometimes avoid this term in
favour of the more general (though less clear) terms
“storage”, “main store”, and “backing store”.
See also
doughnut.
core dump n. A complete briefing consisting of all that
a person knows about a subject.
Also brain dump.
Usage: “Give me a five-minute core dump on SNA
before the staff meeting”. See core, dump.
| core time n. That part of the day in a flextime scheme
|
during which all employees are expected to be present.
|
This is also the hours during which meetings may be
|
held; for example, 09:15 through 16:25 in the UK Labo-
|
ratories.
. Corporate n. Any hierarchical level sufficiently high
.
that it impresses opponents and quashes their arguments.
|
As in: “These rules come from Corporate”.
[Now
|
(1990) gradually being replaced by “top of the
|
business”.] See also edict.
| cost n. The cost to IBM to build a product (usually
|
hardware). (As opposed to its price, which is its nomi-
|
nal selling price.)
. counsel v. To reprimand.
An employee is counselled
.
after making a mistake that is too serious to overlook or
.
to be handled informally. “Was he fired? – No, but he
.
was severely counselled.”
counter-strategic
1. adj. Not
the
official
policy.
Applied to suggestions that one would like to ignore.
“Not the basket in which IBM has placed its eggs.”
2. adj. Not the published official policy. That is, caus-
ing embarrassment to those who are responsible for
what is strategic (q.v.).
crash 1. v. To halt in an unrecoverable manner, when
not expected.
Almost never preceded by a warning
message except when the crash is deliberate.
Usually
indicates human error in hardware or software (or even
firmware).
“The system has crashed AGAIN”.
2. n. The event of crashing. “That was a bad crash”.
creationism n. The principle that large systems are
created from thin air in a single step.
A superstitious
belief devoutly held by many product planners [especial-
ly in warm climates?]. See evolution.
. creeping featurism n. The consequence of adding new
.
features to old, backward, user-hostile products until so
.
many new options, functions, and “enhancements” are
.
added that all coherent concept of the intended function
.
and use of the original product is lost.
A cancerous
.
form of evolution, usually indicative of human failings
.
or organisational ineptitude.
[Not originally an IBM
.
term, but widely met and used.] See also creationism.
crisp up 1. v. To add meaningful content, or to make
more impressive or flashy (usually the latter).
As in:
“We’ll have to crisp up this presentation before the
Director sees it”. 2. v. To remove meaningful content,
to reduce to the essential.
As in: “We’ll have to crisp
up this presentation before the Director sees it”.
critical service n. A hot bug fix. See service.
critical situation n. A customer who has a (real or
perceived) serious problem with IBM hardware or soft-
ware, for which there is no (immediately) available fix.
Unless a fix is provided, the customer is threatening to
call the Chairman of the Board and/or remove all his
IBM equipment and cancel all orders.
This usually
results in the Branch Manager demanding that the
programmers and engineers who own any IBM products
even remotely involved with the customer’s problem
jump on airplanes and converge on the account.
Normally all but one (and possibly all) will be wasting a
trip, but the customer will be impressed by the show of
force, and the problem will get fixed. See also account
situation.
| critical unresolved dependency n. (cud) A reliance
|
of one organisation on another to perform some action
|
or provide some resource that is crucial to another’s
|
plans, where the provider has not yet agreed (indeed,
|
may not be aware of) the dependency. Usage: “We can
|
ship our new box in eight months, but we do have a
|
CUD on the Programming Center to write the operating
|
system by then”.
[Something for those guys to chew
|
on.]
crit sit n. “Field-ese” for critical situation (q.v.).

CRU 
de-concur
CRU (crew)
n. Customer Replaceable Unit.
Part of a
device (such as a keyboard) that is considered to be
replaceable by a customer or end user. (Fix it yourself.)
See FRU.
CSR n. Customer Selected Restaurant.
A good [or, at
any rate, expensive] restaurant. This term is used heavi-
ly in expense claim forms to explain why a person
found it necessary to eat at the most expensive restau-
rant in town – the rationale being that if the customer
one is dining with suggested it, one could hardly refuse,
could one?
. cubicle n. A standard Domestic office, which has a
|
shape that is approximately an eight-foot cube.
Note
|
that most dictionaries define cubicle as a “sleeping
|
compartment”, though it is rumoured that some have
.
outside awareness (q.v.).
. cubie n. The person with whom one shares a cubicle.
currency symbols n. The two characters ('5B'x and
'4A'x) in the EBCDIC coded character set that repre-
sent the primary and secondary currency symbols.
In
the USA these are represented externally by the dollar
and cent signs. In the UK they are shown as the pound
sterling sign and the dollar sign respectively. Expensive
confusion results when a UK user receives a document
from a USA location (or vice-versa), since dollar figures
now appear in pounds, and cents magically become
dollars. The Germans avoid the problem by using both
characters for totally different (non-currency) symbols.
cursor n. An indicator, often a flashing underscore or
rectangle, on a display screen which shows where the
next operation will take place (for example, where typed
characters will appear).
Invented by IBM researcher
|
John Lentz, circa 1954. [A recent advance in “graphical
|
user interfaces” is to allow two (or more) cursors on the
|
screen, thus to confuse the user more rapidly and effec-
|
tively.]
customer n. Any individual not currently employed by
IBM.
| customer ship n. A delivery of a product to a paying
|
customer.
As in: “This product has remained faultless
|
through 5,000 customer ships!” See also FCS.
cut v. To write (record) data onto a tape or disk drive.
Almost certainly derives from the similar use of the
word in the audio recording industry, which in turn
derives from the days when grooves were cut into wax
phonograph cylinders.
Tends to imply a relatively
permanent recording, as in: “Let’s cut the distribution
diskette”. Also used to mean “write” more generally, as
in:
“Please ask accounting to cut a cheque for this
invoice”. Also cut sand, to burn sand (q.v.).
| C-word n. Confidential.
This alternative is used to
|
avoid triggering automatic disk snooping programs that
|
warn of possible security exposures when they detect the
|
string IBM Confidential on an unprotected disk.
“This
|
is not an IBM C-word document.”
CYA (see-wye-ay)
v. To protect one’s rear.
This
protection is typically effected by generating documents
of understanding, obscure memos, PROFS mail, and the
like, which will prove (if necessary) that the author
knew all along that the project was doomed to failure.
Variously estimated to consume between 71% and 78%
of all managerial resources at most development labs.
See MFR.
cycles 1. n. Instruction execution capacity. An instruc-
tion cycle is (or may be – the term is loosely applied)
the time required to execute a single instruction or part
of an instruction in a computer.
Thus, if a program
requires the execution of a large number of instructions,
then it is said to consume many cycles. “Cycles”, there-
fore, is a term for one of the resources that have to be
worried about when designing a computer system.
“If
we run the formatter and the laser at the same time,
we’ll run out of cycles.” This “technical” term is used to
imply that one knows a little about computer hardware.
|
See also MIPS, resource. 2. n. Of a person: time. From
|
the previous sense, as in “do it when you have some
|
spare cycles”.
DASD (dazz-dee)
v. To place on a computer disk
(Direct Access Storage Device), as in: “Please DASD
that report when you’ve written it”.
DASD storage
implies storage on a disk connected to a large
mainframe computer, rather than on the hard or soft
disks in a Personal Computer.
It also implies magnetic
storage; an optical disk would not be described as
DASD.
. dash n. Documentation level.
IBM documents bear a
.
number comprising three groups of characters, separated
.
by dashes.
The final group is one or more digits that
.
indicate the revision level (when ordering a document,
.
you do not normally specify the final group – IBM will
.
send the latest available). A dash-0 is an original (first
.
version) document. “To be at the latest dash” means to
.
have an up-to-date document.
Sometimes also used for
.
software: “We run the latest dash of VM/SP”.
data jail 1. n. A database that is carefully being fed
with information, but whose owner is not sure that the
information in it can be extracted when it is needed.
From Fishkill: “We’re operating a data jail here.”
2. n. A mainframe. (When used by a PC programmer.)
DEBE (debbie) 1. n. “Does Everything But Eat” – a
general 360/370 utility for moving data from device to
device. Originally a stand-alone program (i.e., it did not
require an operating system) named after the niece of its
author.
It is an example of the human interfaces
provided by programs in the 1960s (it’s sad to see how
little the industry has progressed in twenty years).
2. v. To try as a last resort. “Nothing else works; let’s
DEBE it”.
debug v. To hunt down and remove some of the bugs
(q.v.) in a piece of software or hardware.
| debugger n. A program or suite of programs whose
|
function is to aid the process of debugging (q.v.).
decision support system 1. n. A computer program
claimed to help those with power to make decisions.
2. n. Any computer system used to justify something to
higher management that could not be justified in any
other way.
The favoured technique for this usually
involves getting the program to answer a question differ-
ent from the one that ought to have been answered.
Invariably a MIP-eater.
deck n. A data file, usually in Fixed-80 format (every
line of the file is 80 characters long). As in “text deck”
or “request deck”.
This term dates back to the days
when all files were punched on 80-column cards for
which the collective noun was, of course, “decks”. This
is still the correct term to use when the file is a spool
file present in the reader or punch of a virtual machine
(VM).
decommit v. To slip one’s schedule for an indefinite
period of time.
A grave dishonour for project manage-
ment.
de-concur v. To formally remove one’s approval or
agreement to
a project, having previously approved it.
This ploy is most effective when used without warning
and less than a week before Announce, and will then
usually be devastating.
A favourite weapon of Legal
departments. See concur, concern, issue, non-concur.

Especially one between two lines on a graph or chart, as
.
when one line represents the target and the other
.
achievement-to-date. See also jaws chart. 3. v. To arrive

at a result from some known base, particularly by apply-
|
ing a percentage increase to all data. As in: “We’ll just

A demonstration is the
exhibition of non-functioning or unfinished hardware or
software to senior management or visiting VIPs.
Provides the ideal conditions for awakening dormant and

unsuspected bugs. 2. v. To demonstrate.
As in: “We
|
demoed the system structure”, or “When are you
|
demoing today?”
demonstration application program n. A game.
| depeditate v. To cut off at the feet. Used especially in
|
the context of electronic formatting and typesetting
|
when the descenders of lowercase letters are cut off by a
|
rule (line) or on reaching the end of a column or page.
| dependency n. A minor exposure (q.v.).
design n. The preliminary sequence of events leading to
the manufacture and delivery of a finished product.
This may be a) An educated guess; or b) [more
commonly] An uneducated guess.
| deskcheck v. To run a computer program through a
|
“One Instruction Per Second” [at best] human processor,
|
in order to check or test it by thought experiment.
See
|
also inspection, MIPS.
desk dump v. To clear all the paper on a desk into a
drawer at night to meet local “clean desk” policies. The
drawer then becomes a LIFO stack, as most of the paper
is never retrieved until archived in a waste bin. See also
core dump, dump.
. desk MIPS n. Processing power that is provided by
.
physically small (desk-top or desk-side) computers. See
.
also water MIPS, MIPS.
| de-smut v. To correct errors in a SCRIPT file.
The
|
name comes from the name of the file in which Script
|
stores error messages, DSMUTMSG.
“Looks like you
|
still have to de-smut some of those errors.” See also
|
script.
diagnostic n. A program written to test other programs
or (more usually) the hardware of a system.
It is
intended to be used, when a failure occurs, to identify
the failing unit or sub-assembly.
It often seems that
diagnostics are the only pieces of code that will run
cleanly when the hardware starts to fail, as the diagnos-
tics were of course written to test the expected modes
of failure.
dialogue 1. n. A pompous alternative to “conversation”
or “chat”.
“Let’s have a dialogue.” 2. v. To talk to.
As in: “Why don’t you call Steve and dialogue with him
about that project?”
diff v. To make a list of changes.
Refers to the widely
used program DIFF that attempts to show the differ-
ences between two program or data files. “Please diff
those two proposals for me.” See also delta, bridge.
| dinner for two n. A small award to recognise an
|
employee’s contribution to a project or department. The
|
amount of the award is small enough that a first-line
|
manager can bestow the award with only one, or no,
|
higher level approval, but yet is sufficient to pay for a
|
good dinner for the employee and a guest.
dinosaur 1. n. A person or location that clings to old
software packages long after everyone else has moved to
later and better designs.
Usually only a cataclysm (in
the form of a major new release of operating system
software) will encourage a change in the lifestyle of a
|
dinosaur. 2. n. A major problem or bug.
Usage: “OK,
|
... we’ll build a system and bring it up second-level to
|
get the dinosaurs out.
Then we can start the detailed
|
debugging”.
disclaimer n. A list of conditions or warnings that
modify the material just about to be presented at a meet-
ing.
A boiler plate blanket statement that disassociates
and relieves a presenter of any responsibility from
conclusions that his audience may have reached as a
result of his statements, regardless of whether the
conclusions were intended or not.
Commonly used in
hardware or software proposals and performance presen-
tations. See also caveat.
disconnected, disc’ed 1. adj. Of a 
VM Virtual
Machine: not logically connected to a terminal, and
therefore running without human intervention. The VM
operating system supports two “inactive” states: logged-
off (not using the system at all) and disconnected
(suspended). When disconnected, a userid maintains all
its state and activities, but has no “real” user terminal
connected to the virtual machine.
Most service
machines (q.v.) run disconnected. 2. adj. Of a user: not
using a network or computer.
Also discoed, as in: “I
tried to see if she wanted to vend [buy coffee from a
machine] with us, but she’s discoed”. 3. adj. Of a
person: paying little attention to the outside physical
world, due to distraction, great ideas, or lack of sleep.
Such a person is usually reconnected by a loud yell
from a suitably high (hierarchical) level, or by a stiff
dose of caffeine. 4. adj. Having little interest in a
particular topic.
“Since I started to use VM, I’ve been
pretty much disconnected from TSO.”
. disk n. A magnetic or optical storage mechanism in the
.
form of a rotating disk.
Information is recorded on the
.
disk in the form of numerous concentric “tracks” or as a
.
single spiral track.
The term is also used for logical
.
simulations of disks that are in fact held on larger disks,
.
or in main storage, or on magnetic tapes or cartridges.
.
See also file, floppy disk, minidisk, round and brown,
.
Winchester.
| diskette n. A floppy disk (q.v.).
disk farm n. A large room (or rooms) filled with
magnetic storage machines.
Infrequently frequented by
humans.
Disneyland East n. The headquarters building on
Westchester Avenue, White Plains (see 1133 below).
This term gained such widespread use that several years
ago a middle manager (who later became a very senior
marketing manager and wrote a book about his experi-
ences) actually sent out a memo forbidding its use.
distributed data processing 1. n. (Official version)
A methodology for selling small CPUs for use at remote
sites. 2. n. (Unofficial version, pre-1986) A methodol-
ogy for spreading competitors’ minis and micros around
remote sites, as there was no 4311.
[But now there is

Divisions 
driver
Divisions 1. n. Any IBM locations outside New York
State, or north of Interstate 84, or west of the Hudson
River.
2. n. A
derogatory
term
used
at
Yorktown
Research to describe the rest of IBM. “That idea came
from the Divisions.” See also NIH.
document administrator n. Quote from a GML manu-
al: “One who is responsible for defining markup
conventions and procedures for an installation.
This
involves defining the actual vocabulary of tags to be
used and also the nature of the processing required for
each”. [Need one say more?]
documentation 1. n. The several kilograms of mashed,
pounded, bleached, and pressed trees that accompany
any modern, sophisticated product.
Happily, documen-
tation is sometimes now provided on-line (that is, avail-
able at a computer terminal), and is, of course, always
written before implementation. 2. n. Instructions trans-
lated from Swedish to Japanese by Danes for the profit
of English-speaking persons.
document of understanding 1. n. (When signed by
one party to an agreement.)
A memo that is used to
present one party’s view of an agreement in the best
possible light. Usually shows little or no understanding
of the problems of the other party to the agreement. See
CYA. 2. n. (When signed by both parties to an agree-
ment.) A document (which is not a contract) drawn up
between two different departments or companies within
IBM, often associated with the transfer of a product or
program from one group to another.
The only mech-
anism whereby the owner of a piece of software can
maintain any formal control over it once another IBM
group has a copy of it. [Also known as a letter of
understanding or memo of understanding.]
dog and pony show n. A presentation designed to
[over-] impress.
Implies a certain amount of cynicism
and deception, and contempt for the audience.
do it right first time n. A popular Quality slogan.
Potentially synonymous with the slogan, “Let the user
do the debugging”.
Correctly deciding what to do next
is perhaps even more important. See creationism.
dollarize
v. To express intangible assets (such as
programmer creativity) in terms of U.S. dollars.
This
allows even the most subtle of concepts to be grasped
by the materialistic.
Domestic adj. Those parts of IBM that are located in
the USA. Used by U.S. IBMers to imply all that really
matters in IBM.
Used almost universally by everyone
else to describe an insular (provincial) approach to a
problem.
“He’s Domestic – thinks everyone speaks
American.” See also nonus.
. done deal n. Something that has been done and is no
.
longer open for discussion; a fait accompli.
dotted to 1. adj. Having a managerial relationship or
political link that cannot be described by a hierarchical
tree. Refers to the (dashed) lines shown on organisation
charts.
This is often used for professionals (such as
lawyers and accountants) whose managers do not under-
stand what they do, so they are “dotted to” someone in
Armonk.
An “abnormal but legitimate” relationship.
2. adj. Directly connected by hardware.
In electronics,
a Dot is often a wire-ORed or wire-ANDed gate: the
logical operation takes place by two gate outputs being
connected directly, and the final output depends on
which gate wins.
doubleword n. Eight bytes (an IBM System/370 Word
is 4 bytes, or 32 bits).
A doubleword boundary is
an address that is an exact multiple of eight.
Many
System/360 or System/370 instructions either require
their operands to be aligned on a DW boundary, or
work much faster if the operands are so aligned. See
also fullword, halfword.
doughnut n. A ferrite core (actually a torus or ring
about one or two millimetres in diameter, hence this
term) used in the Core memory of early IBM computers.
Also donut.
Ferrite cores are still used in some IBM
computers, such as those used on space shuttles; in the
commercial world probably the last product using core
memories that was announced was the control unit for
the 2305 drum (shipped in 1973). See also core.
Doughnut City n. Basingstoke, Hampshire (a town with
a rapidly growing IBM presence).
So dubbed for the
large number of roundabouts (traffic circles) encircling
the town.
[This term predates the IBM usage.] It was
conjectured, and came to pass, that as more and more
IBM personnel were moved there a verb was created, as
in “I have now been doughnutted” – re-located to
Basingstoke.
[Both friends and relations of mine
believed not that Basingstoke had an existence other
than in Ruddigore.]
down adj. Not working; the opposite of up.
Crashed.
The state of the system or printer when you need one
more listing and you are already late for your plane. See
also bring up.
down-level 1. adj. Out-of-date.
Applied to a person
who is not up to date with some technical nuance, or to
a piece of software that is not the latest (current)
version.
Derived from FE terminology applied to soft-
|
ware. See also back-level. 2. v. To demote, to reduce in
|
level (q.v.). Also re-level.
. downtime n. The length of time that a system is
.
unavailable to users (down). “How much downtime did
.
we have last week?”
dramatic adj. Uninteresting. An adjective used to make
an unexciting fact sound worthy of attention, as in: “A
dramatic three percent increase in I/O throughput”. See
also exciting.
drink from a fire hose v. To be at the receiving end of
a flood of information, as when attending a major
university for the first time.
Originally used in IBM to
describe how it was for European visitors to the Boulder
lab as they tried to “get up to speed” on the Mass Stor-
age System during its development. A group at Boulder
was charged with teaching the visitors how the system
was designed and how it worked [markedly different,
I’m told]. This group spent “a memorable 18 months or
so in 1972-74 designing microcode debugging classes
one day ahead of the students”.
drive 1. v. To push a project along in spite of many
objections and obstacles.
“Sam, you will drive the
water fountain replacement project to a successful
conclusion by next Tuesday, won’t you?” 2. n. A
mechanical system for rotating some piece of a comput-
er, as in “Disk Drive”. Also used to refer to a complete
disk assembly, as in “Place the diskette in the B Drive”.
|
See also spindle. 3. v. To use or control, especially of a
|
terminal or program. Usage: “I’m not sure how to drive
|
this debugger”.
drive-in branch n. ISG HQ in Bethesda, Maryland.
Named for an incident in 1982 when a former IBM
employee drove his car through the doors of the build-
ing (which never was a branch office, in fact) and went
on a shooting spree that killed or injured a number of
people. Many of the fortifications around the entrances
of IBM buildings date from this incident. [This usage is
unfortunately quite common, being used by those
unaware of the details of the incident.
It is considered
to be in bad taste by those who lost friends and
colleagues.] See also Rusty Bucket.
driver 1. n. A program that “drives” a bucket of test
cases. 2. n. The main processing loop of an interactive
program. 3. n. A complete new level of a system. As
in: “The developers cut us a new VM driver yesterday”.

driving a brown desk
end user
driving a brown desk adj. Having achieved the techni-
cal rank of Advisory Engineer (or Programmer).
This
derives from the practice in some locations of giving
tacky metal desks to the more junior employees, and
reserving real (wooden, or wood veneered) desks for
those who have been around for some time.
. drop-dead date n. A deadline by which certain events
.
must have occurred if irretrievable loss of honour or
.
revenue to IBM (or a customer) is to be avoided.
.
Should the events not occur, irretrievable loss of honour
.
and revenue to the responsible marketing representative
.
is likely; and the phrase may take on literal overtones.
| drum card n. A card, wrapped around a cylinder or
|
drum within the mechanism of an IBM 026 or 029 card
|
punch, that controlled some of the features of the punch,
|
such as tabbing, automatic duplication, numeric shift,
|
etc. A little drum card wizardry could often save hours
|
or days of data or program entry time.
dual ladder n. The principle that one can rise in the
company at equal levels in either a managerial or a tech-
nical job.
Once impossible outside the USA (most
countries did not even maintain the practice of having
different titles for technical and managerial personnel)
but more fashionable since the late 1980s.
. dual-path 1. v. To provide alternative paths through
.
program code in order to accommodate different envi-
.
ronments.
“Since the CP response is different in
.
VM/SP and VM/XA, we’ll have to dual-path that Exec”.
.
See also special-case. 2. v. To make a peripheral device
.
available through more than one channel.
This can
.
improve performance, and, on multi-processor systems,
.
allows the device to be available even if one processor
.
is off-line.
dump n. A collection of all available information about
a problem, usually deposited on the slowest printing
device available.
Originally a complete printed repre-
sentation of all the storage in a computer, this was a
manageable quantity of information when a 100 Kilo-
byte machine was a big one. Now that machines are so
much larger, dumps contain a vast amount of irrelevant
information – yet some people still use dumps for
debugging problems.
(Equivalent to cracking an
eggshell with a steamroller.) The “Garbage Out” part of
“Garbage In, Garbage Out”. See also core dump.
DWIM instruction (like swim)
n. “Do What I Mean.”
This is a mythical instruction invoked by a frustrated
programmer to give acceptable results when in fact he
could not define what he meant (but would recognise it
if he saw it).
Also invoked when the last instruction
issued to the machine was disastrous: “Do what I mean,
not what I say, you dumb machine!” In LISP environ-
ments, the DWIM instruction is often simply a mech-
anism that randomly rearranges parentheses.
earth n. The safety cable in a domestic or commercial
power supply.
This is the term used by non-USA
English speakers instead of “ground”, possibly reflecting
the more rounded world view of such people.
earthquake n. A real-life shock test for computer equip-
ment.
Contrary to popular belief, recent earthquakes
near California plants were not initiated by IBM as part
of the Quality testing program.
ease-of-use 1. n. The attribute of being easy to use.
An ill-defined but positive quality achieved only by
products of the speaker’s company or laboratory.
2. n. A quality claimed for all programming languages,
to demonstrate superiority over machine languages or
lower level languages.
OS JCL is a fine counter-
example to this claim.
easter egging n. Replacing an unrelated part in the
hope that a malfunction will go away. The term derives
from the USA and European Easter-time practice of
hiding coloured eggs, chocolates, and other goodies
around the house, the garden, or the town square. Chil-
dren are invited in and usually then engage in a hurried
scamper through the territory to collect goodies and win
various prizes that may be awarded. The implication in
the jargon usage is that the engineer did a similar search
through his machine looking for the part that would fix
the problem.
This is the only IBM-approved game of chance,
except that Easter Egging is forbidden in the 308X
Processor Complex.
| eat one’s lunch v. To use up personal time. Used after
|
attempting to fix a system, usually a broken one, for
|
such an intensive and extended period of time that one
|
emerges from the effort to find that one’s personal time
|
has mysteriously disappeared.
“That 3380 string was
|
down all day with a power bug that ate my lunch.”
EBCDIC (ebb-sidick, ebb-see-dick)
n. The Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code. This code for
characters was designed in the early 1960s, as an exten-
sion of the BCDIC to take advantage of the 8-bit byte
being introduced for the System/360.
The most notori-
ous of its idiosyncrasies (that the primary English alpha-
 bet is not a series of contiguous codes) is ultimately
derived from the Hollerith code for punched cards. See
also ASCII bit.
EC 1. n. Engineering Change – a hardware update.
A
formally announced fix or enhancement to a piece of
hardware, usually required to support later (unforeseen)
products. “Before you can run the new level of system
with this box, you must apply EC-58320 to all your
control units.” 2. n. Extended Control – a privileged or
enhanced state of control over a piece of hardware.
If,
for example, a person is running an MVS system under
VM/SP, then that person’s virtual machine has to be in
EC mode, and is said to be “running EC”.
-ed (suffix to a surname). Subjected to unnecessary trou-
bles due to a person’s inconsideration or paranoia.
As
.
in: “I’ve been Smithed”.
The suffix can also be added
.
to the name of a program or utility, and in this case
.
implies that the user has suffered abuse at the hands of
.
said program: “I’ve been MSGed to death by our
.
network machine”.
edict v. To decree, to issue an edict. “The use of Struc-
tured Programming was edicted by Corporate.”
elastic adj. Able to stretch.
This is used to refer to a
schedule that is subject to frequent stretching.
Unlike
true elastic, such schedules rarely contract (shorten).
| EMEA
n. Abbreviation for “Europe, Middle East,
|
Africa”. The division of IBM that includes all the coun-
|
try organisations in the designated geographical area.
|
That is, most of the high growth areas.
emotional issue n. A real problem (as seen by one
person) when not seen as a problem by another person.
Used when the second person is insensitive or (more
commonly) has no taste.
Endicott suitcase n. A corrugated cardboard box with
a suitcase-like handle.
These were issued to students
leaving Marketing Training classes (which originally
were held at Endicott) for transporting class materials
back to their home location.
end user n. A person at the end of the chain of hard-
ware, systems, and interfaces. A (possibly hypothetical)
person who is expected to represent the biggest group of
users of computer equipment in the future. When usage
of the term is such that it implies that the speaker is
superior to such an end-user, the speaker has identified
19

engine
face down, nine to the throat
himself or herself as at best insensitive and at worst,
arrogant. See also naive.
engine n. A small processor such as the 8100, or a
microprocessor (when used as the central processor in
some device). “Our new terminal cluster controller uses
the latest engine”.
engineering change n. See EC.
enhancement n. A fix for a problem that has been
reported too often to be ignored. See feature.
entry-level adj. Simple enough for a naive user to start
with. Sadly, many entry-level computer systems are just
toys – they do not have the capabilities necessary to do
real work.
entry system n. A system that is easy to start using,
either because it is inexpensive (cheap) or because it is
simple to use (entry-level). Something to do with front-
door bells?
EPL (ee-pee-ell)
n. The European Program Library
|
(since 1987 called the Software and Publications Centre,
|
or SPC, but still commonly known as EPL).
The
European equivalent of PID (q.v.), and even more
inscrutable.
Availability from EPL is always at least
one month later than from PID, except when a program
product is developed in Europe and sent to EPL first.
EREP (errep, ee-rep)
v. To take a snapshot of an error
log or trace.
From Environmental Recording Editing
and Printing, a program for printing a formatted log of
hardware and software error conditions on System/360
and System/370 machines.
Also used (as a noun) to
designate the output of such a program.
EREPs, like
dumps, are “run” or “taken” (other listings are usually
“printed”).
escalate v. To take a matter to higher (managerial)
authority. Very effective as a threat.
ESP (esp, ee-ess-pee) 1. n. Early Support Program.
A
procedure by which certain members of the lunatic fringe
– both internal and external – are given versions of a
product after announce but before FCS.
The object of
the exercise is to get the bugs out of the product and
confirm its
ease-of-use without creating too many
account situations.
Also called LA (Limited Availabili-
ty), though there are some slight differences. See also
GA. 2. n. Extra Sensory Perception.
The technique by
which ESP (1.) users learn the details of the product in
the absence of any knowledge on the part of the support
staff or of any documentation. 3. v. To ship the ESP
(1.) version of a product to the brave volunteers that
.
will try it. 4. v. To install a new version of a product
.
before anyone else.
“Our Compute Centre folks are
.
very progressive, they ESPed SP4.”
ETN adj. Equivalent To New.
Of computer parts: used
somewhere (and therefore burned-in) and hence, after
testing, more reliable than new parts. [So it is hoped.]
Europe n. That part of the (IBM) world that consists of
Israel, South Africa, and the European countries –
excluding parts of the Eastern Bloc, Albania, and Libya.
evolution n. The process of implementing a large
system by incremental and coherent improvements to a
simple system.
No other process has ever been known
to work. See creationism, creeping featurism.
. excellent adj. best-of-breed (q.v.).
exciting adj. Having the lowest interest ranking for
speeches and papers delivered at internal meetings. The
complete sequence is: exciting, interesting, dramatic,
mind-boggling, and Registered IBM Confidential.
See
also dramatic.
. exec n. A macro whose output is a sequence of
.
commands for the Conversational Monitor System
.
(CMS).
The term is derived from the name of the
.
original interpreter, and the filetype that distinguished
.
these macros. The meaning is often extended to include
.
any macro written in the EXEC, EXEC 2, or REXX
.
languages, regardless of the destination of the generated
.
commands (GDDM, SQL, etc.). The term is reported to
.
have spread to the PC-DOS environment, where it
.
designates the PC-DOS equivalent of CMS Execs –
.
otherwise known as BAT (batch) files.
execute v. A commonly used word more or less mean-
ing “to run” (a program) or “to process”.
The term is
now avoided in IBM customer publications since it
makes readers in many countries nervous.
. exempt adj. Of a Domestic employee’s job level:
.
exempt from certain labour laws; no longer eligible for
.
payment for work carried out after standard hours.
.
Implies (but does not necessarily mean) that the employ-
.
ee has reached “professional” status.
exercise 1. v. To test by running a collection of tasks,
often by running a test bucket.
This gives a new or
overhauled machine a chance to become more physically
fit before undergoing a rigorous acceptance test.
“We
are going to exercise the machine.” See also stress.
.
2. n. A play, or sham, project.
exerciser n. A program written to intensively exercise a
portion of a machine. The hope is that an operation that
occasionally fails can be forced to fail more often, and
frequently enough to allow the CE to find and correct
the fault. See also stress.
expectation management n. A management technique
whereby the target employees are persuaded to feel truly
grateful for what they are about to receive. An essential
prelude to the assignment of “career developing” tasks,
or to the removal of services. See also job rotation.
. expert n. One who has some knowledge of a topic that
.
therefore qualifies him or her for an urgent but undesira-
.
ble task. “I hear you’re our JCL expert” – “Well, I did
.
look at some JCL one afternoon a few years ago...” –
.
“So you are the expert then!”. See also guru.
. expire v. To pass, irrepealably. “That issue has expired
.
its deadline for solutioning.”
exposed adj. Almost certain to be omitted.
This is
used to describe part (or all) or a project that must for
political reasons be described as in-plan, yet is unlikely
to actually be produced. “The third line item is in-plan,
exposed”.
exposure 1. n. Some aspect of a project that looks as
though it may become a problem.
“That’s a big expo-
sure.” See also dependency. 2. n. Danger, risk.
A
necessary euphemism, since the words are not otherwise
found in the IBM vocabulary. 3. n. Visibility to upper
management or external agencies.
“You’ll get good
exposure in this assignment.” As all mountain climbers
know, there is always the risk of over-exposure unless
one takes proper precautions.
exterior wet conditions n. Rain.
The term used by
IBM Canada’s security department to excuse evacuation
of a headquarters building during a fire drill.
external audit n. Examination of the current state and
risks of a project by an outside group, followed by a
report of its findings.
The report usually tells upper
management exactly what they were afraid that they
would discover if they were to pull their heads out of
the sand. See bad information.
| externalize v. To document or publish.
Usually found
|
in the negative, as in: “We have decided not to
|
externalize the format of the CICS System Definition
|
File”.
| face down, nine to the throat adj. Computers that
|
used cards for input data (and pre-computer tabulating
|
equipment) required that any deck of cards be stacked in
|
a particular way to process correctly.
Almost every
20

Dictionary of IBM Jargon

face time
feature
|
IBM machine that used cards carried a label in the card
|
feed area indicating how to place the deck in the feed
|
hopper of that machine; the most common was face
|
(printed side) down, with the 9-edge (q.v.) forward,
|
towards the throat where cards are swallowed by the
|
machine; this phrase dates from the 1952-1964 era. The
|
later face down, 9-edge forward, and the alternative
|
face up, 12-edge first were very common, and may
|
still exist on working card machinery.
Engineers who
|
were unusually proficient in, or (more commonly)
|
obsessed with, computers and their technology were said
|
to eat, sleep, and breathe computers until ultimately they
|
would be “buried face down, nine to the throat” – an
|
expression of mild esteem. See also column binary.
. face time n. Time to confront another person face-to-
.
face. “I think it’s face time on this one.”
facility 1. n. Being facile. Like most people, IBMers do
not recognise this meaning, but often demonstrate it.
2. n. The ability to make something easier (or even
possible); incorrectly derived from the verb “to
facilitate”. Used in the titles of many IBM service func-
tions and products which would otherwise not be
polysyllabic enough to make their designers feel impor-
tant. See also polysyllabic, system. 3. n. A program or
software package whose function is (by the definition of
its authors) useful.
“Facility” is usually a misnomer,
however, as the programs that are accredited this grand
description are often exceedingly complicated and diffi-
cult to use.
. failsoft adj. Of a system or network: designed so that
.
the failure of one part of the system will not be
.
catastrophic; some or all of the requirements of some or
.
all of the users will continue to be met.
fallback plan n. A plan to fall back upon should the
first plan be rejected by higher management.
This is
often the plan preferred by the development manager –
he can count on his management turning down the first
plan (so demonstrating their power) but can be reason-
ably confident that the second one he proposes will be
accepted.
This strategy, of course, becomes a self-
fulfilling prophesy;
since the first plan is not the
preferred plan, it is often not properly thought out or
presented – and is hence guaranteed to be rejected.
fall on one’s sword v. To voluntarily decommit a plan,
knowing that this action will invoke extreme displeas-
ure.
Falling on one’s sword was the honourable means
for a Roman to commit suicide.
“I knew we couldn’t
make the dates so I went to the boss and fell on my
sword”.
fall over v. Synonymous with ABEND, crash.
As in:
“One of the 2305s fell over last night and took CP with
it”.
Fall Plan n. A plan, adopted in the autumn of each year,
that describes the future commitments and business of a
location or division. [Now known as the Commit Plan.]
This is preceded by a period of three months during
which most productive work stops for a general free-for-
all over which projects are to be considered strategic.
The plan, once adopted, is ignored. See Spring Plan.
family dinner n. An evening meal paid for by IBM,
usually before Christmas, for a department or group of
departments. The term derives from the ancient concept
of IBM being one big happy family of employees. This
is supposedly an event to recognise the effort put in
during the year, and can therefore be relied upon to
introduce colleagues from work whom one has never
met and did not know existed.
| FAP n. Financial Assistance Program.
A programme
|
originally offered to ESD (Entry Systems Division)
|
employees, whose job disappeared as a result of PS/2
|
manufacturing moving from Boca Raton to Raleigh, and
|
later extended.
Employees who took advantage of the
|
original FAP resigned from IBM, and received a golden
|
handshake of two years salary plus a bonus. This led to
|
such expressions as: “Taking the FAP”, “Faphappy”,
|
and “Are you going to fap or flap?”.
fast back end n. That part of a product development
cycle that is supposed to take far less time than usual in
order to make up for the schedule slips of the earlier
parts. “We’ll have to put in a fast back end in order to
make FCS on time.” [That is, drop some of the testing.]
| fastpath 1. v. To enhance the performance of a program
|
in certain cases by reducing the amount of code
|
executed when a given condition arises, especially when
|
the condition is common, or where the existing perform-
|
ance of the program doesn’t meet users’ expectations.
|
“We will have to fastpath the case where the file isn’t
|
open yet”. See also special-case. 2. v. To access some
|
data directly, rather than, for instance, following an
|
otherwise tree-structured (hierarchical) path.
For exam-
|
ple, instead of selecting choices “1”, “3”, “4”, “B” in
|
consecutive menus, you might be able to go to the same
|
panel by typing “134B”. This can be much faster, espe-
|
cially over slow connections, because only the final
|
menu will be displayed.
Of course, strings such as
|
“134B” were formerly spelled differently (for instance,
|
“COPY”) and were known as commands. 3. n. The
|
nickname used to directly access some panel in a tree-
|
structured menu. As in: “what’s the best fastpath to get
|
to PCPRICES?”
. fast track n. A career path for selected men and women
.
who appear to conform to the management ideal.
The
.
career path is designed to enhance their abilities and
.
loyalty, traditionally by rapid promotion and by protect-
.
ing them from the more disastrous errors that they might
.
commit.
fatal adj. Very serious.
When used to describe a prob-
lem, this indicates that recovery from the problem has
not been possible, as in “FATAL I/O ERROR”. Always
presented in all upper case, as only t’owd man was
confident enough to use such a word in a Data Process-
ing environment.
[“T’owd man” – An Ancient (from
the Derbyshire mining term).]
fat, dumb and happy adj. Complacent.
Typically
used of a project’s management who think that their
project is competitive when it is not.
[Not exclusively
an IBM term.]
| fatherhood n. Something that is good, but not necessar-
|
ily true. See motherhood.
FBC n. Funny Black Connector.
The hermaphroditic
connector used in the cabling system (q.v.).
FCS n. First customer ship (q.v.).
The time at which
products are first delivered to customers, usually cause
for celebration. (“Pub Time”.) This is also the time at
which FE starts fixing the bugs that were discovered too
late in the development cycle to be corrected. See also
announce, ESP, GA.
feature 1. n. A piece of a product (software or hard-
ware).
2. n. A bug for which no fix is going to be
made available. 3. n. A correction to a publication.
4. n. A mandatory “option” on a piece of hardware. As
in: “Of course, if you want to run any software on this
machine, you must order the optional Decimal Feature”.
See also creeping featurism, enhancement.

feature shock
flipchart
feature shock n. A user’s confusion when confronted
with a package that has too many features and poor
introductory material.
Originally a pun on Alvin
Toffler’s title Future Shock.
feeb v. To perform some act in a feeble (or awkward)
manner.
For example: “He really feebed that piece of
coding”.
feecher, feechur
n. An unforeseen, arbitrary, or
capricious attribute, which, once documented, is spelled
“feature” (q.v.).
fence 1. n. Some special sequence of characters (such
as hexadecimal “FF”) used to delimit other data. Usage:
“You should put a fence at the end of the parameter
list”. 2. v. To protect storage so that it cannot be stolen
by another user while you are not actually using it. An
excellent mechanism for justifying a storage upgrade.
.
See also fence out. 3. v. To protect people from being
.
“poached” by other departments.
“My Adtech head-
.
count is fenced this year.”
fence out v. To electronically disconnect an element
from the operating configuration.
In the 308X series,
Fencing Out is done by fence registers that are set and
unset by the Processor Controller.
This concept was
devised by the original 308X RAS Engineering Depart-
ment, and in doing so they discovered the aeroplane rule
(see above). See also box, granularity.
ference error (fear-ence error)
n. An indexing error
occurring when the IBM System 38 encounters a null or
invalid index or subscript. This derives from an error in
a message handling routine, that truncated the first two
characters of the message – it should have read: “Refer-
ence Error”. However, “Ference Error” conveys just as
much information.
field 1. n. The IBM marketplace – where the profits
come from.
Anywhere outside the Development group.
2. n. (When used at a headquarters location.)
The
development laboratories.
file 1. n. A collection of records held in a filing
system on a disk or other storage device.
2. n. A
magnetic disk storage device, usually a Winchester.
“We’re designing hard files for PCs.”
. file farm n. A disk farm (q.v.).
. finding n. A security exposure, discovered during a
.
Security audit. In theory, a finding could be either good
.
or bad, but there have been no reports of a good finding.
finger check n. A typing error on a computer terminal.
Usage: “I took a finger check while entering that
command”. Derived from the usage of check. See also
brain check.
. finis (fin-iss)
n. To close a file, under the CMS operat-
.
ing system. This [Latin] command name was chosen by
.
a Frenchman who worked on the CMS file system in the
.
1960s.
Often the incantation “FINIS * * *” (close all
.
files) is suggested as a panacea for CMS applications
.
developers.
Finnoga- prefix. A generic prefix used to avoid using a
Registered 
Trade

firefighter n. A person or group of people called in to
put out a forest fire.
A good firefighter is the highest
form of programmer life, but all too often firefighters
are totally unfamiliar with the fire being fought.
Fire-
fighters are famous for their interim patches or fixes.
These patches, once implemented, become permanent
and the tinder to spark off later Forest Fires. It is often
said that firefighters are “called too late to even water
the hot ashes”.
| first-line manager n. The lowest level of line manage-
|
ment (q.v.).
A first-line manager has only “employees”
|
(as opposed to managers) reporting to him or her.
A
|
second-line manager will hold the cards of (employ) at
|
least one first-line manager. The term can also be used
|
in a relative sense; when employees report directly to
|
upper levels of management then one person’s third-line
|
manager can be another’s fifth-line.
. FISH (fish)
n. A queuing algorithm that seems to be
.
common in overloaded networks: “First In, Still Here”.
.
By analogy with FIFO (First In, First Out) and LIFO
.
(Last In, First Out).
fix n. A correction for a software problem.
“You need
the following three fixes to correct the file system bug”.
Software equivalent of engineering change.
| fixed disk n. A disk, usually a hard disk (q.v.), packaged
|
with its electronics and which cannot easily be removed
|
from the machine in which it is installed.
| fixed head n. A Read/Write head (q.v.) which is fixed
|
in position relative to the surface of a disk, rather than
|
being moveable across some or all of the disk.
Data
|
that are on the disk surface under a fixed head can be
|
accessed more rapidly than those under the more
|
common moveable heads; the fixed head area of a disk
|
is therefore often used for paging, database storage, etc.
fix it in pubs v. To change the product publications.
Unfortunately nothing to do with the ancient art of Ale
sampling, but is instead a favourite way to correct any
problem found in the six months before FCS.
See
feature, pubs.
flash v. To copy by xerography.
See also ibmox, open
kimono[?].
Flashcube on the Mountain n. The Sterling Forest
.
Laboratory, New York.
This name was a take-off on
.
the “Motel on the Mountain” which, in the 1950s, was a
.
fashionable motel on Route 17 in NY (not far from Ster-
.
ling Forest).
In an era when motels were cheap
.
buildings alongside noisy highways, this was a nice
.
“low level” hotel. It was built into the side of a moun-
.
tain and had multiple small buildings of several different
.
levels, and many of its rooms had nice views.
flatten v. To bring under control, to eliminate, or to
make less conspicuous.
“Gee, we’ve got bad problems
with that new software from Yorktown. Shall we bring
a bunch of them up to flatten the problem?”
(The
implication being that any problem can be trampled into
the dust by the application of hordes of programmers.)
The origin of this term in fact comes from the math-
ematical sense of flattening a curve (or worse, a vertical
line) showing problem discoveries, APARs, et al.
Usage: “We’ll flatten that problem when the Umbrella
PTF gets out there”.
flavour, flavor n. A variety or version of a program or
piece of hardware. “This system comes in two flavours:
SP and XA.” An analogy with ice-cream varieties. See
vanilla, chocolate, mocha.
. fletching n. See snow, angel dust.
| flextime, flexitime n. A scheme allowing flexible work-
|
ing hours. These schemes let people vary their start and
|
end times from day to day, around a fixed core time.
|
With some schemes one can accumulate excess time
|
worked and use it for extra leave.
flipchart n. A large piece of paper used for drawing
charts as a presentation aid.
Often faintly marked with
squares which are of length 1/7920 part of a furlong on
a side (once known as an “inch”).
These 25.4mm
|
squares help the presenter draw straight lines.
Once
|
especially favoured for formal presentations at Corporate
|
HQ, but nowadays almost totally superseded by foils,

floor sort
freezer
|
slides, PCs running fancy programs, and projection
|
displays.
. floor sort n. A spilt box of computer cards. A standard
.
box held approximately 2000 cards, which could be
.
shuffled by the simple and effective technique of depos-
.
iting them in a heap upon the floor. If the cards did not
.
have a sequence of numbers to identify their order they
.
had to be re-sorted by hand.
floor system n. The operating system used by the
majority of people on a machine (as opposed to a test or
private system). See spin system.
FLOP (flop)
n. Floating Point OPeration, more usually
seen in the construct Megaflops (Millions of Floating
Point Operations per Second), a measure of performance
usually applied to scientific vector processors.
The
abbreviation FLOP has the added advantage, in the
commercial world, of sounding slightly derogatory. See
also MIPS.
| floppy disk n. A flexible magnetic storage disk, now
|
more often called a diskette.
Floppies were originally
|
eight inches in diameter, and were first used, in the
|
early 1970s, for loading the initial program into control
|
units and mainframe computers. See IPL, Minnow.
| focal point n. A person who has been assigned respon-
|
sibility for coordinating an effort or supporting a large
|
project (such as the development of microcode for an
|
entire system).
Warning:
if you are at a focal point,
|
you may get burned.
focus n. Critical scrutiny with a view to swift corrective
action. As in: “There will be focus on Quality at year-
end”.
foil n. Viewgraph, transparency, viewfoil – a thin sheet
or leaf of transparent plastic material used for
“overhead” projection of illustrations (visual aids). Only
the term “Foil” is widely used in IBM.
It is the most
popular of the three presentation media (slides, foils, and
flipcharts) except at Corporate HQ, where even in the
1980s flipcharts are favoured.
In Poughkeepsie, social
status is gained by owning one of the new, very
compact, and very expensive foil projectors that make it
easier to hold meetings almost anywhere and at any
time.
The origins of this word have been obscured by the
use of lower case.
The original usage was “FOIL”
which, of course, was an acronym. Further research has
discovered that the acronym originally stood for “Foil
Over Incandescent Light”.
This therefore seems to be
IBM’s first attempt at a recursive language.
. Foil
Factory
n. IBM Australia’s Headquarters at
.
Cumberland Forest, New South Wales.
See also Koala
.
Park.
fold v. To change minuscules (lowercase alphabetical
letters) to majuscules (uppercase alphabetical letters).
Also “translate to upper case”.
Only a very few pieces
of software do this correctly for languages other than
English, or even claim to.
follow-on n. A new release or version of a product,
sufficiently different to merit a new product number but
including all the bugs and problems of the previous
product architecture.
(This is the usual result of being
compatible with previous releases.)
food chain n. The (hierarchical) line of management.
An indirect reference to the military term “chain of
command”, and to the zoological term.
As in: “He is
too low in the food chain to really matter”.
See also
line management, lion food, nonlinear.
footprint 1. n. The floor or desk space taken up by
some piece of computer equipment, such as a terminal
or processor.
As in: “Our box has a smaller footprint
than that of xyz”. See also visual footprint, toeprint.
2. n. The audit trail left by a program so that a recov-
ery program or programmer can determine the areas of
storage that the first program stepped upon.
. footware n. Footwear.
A list of tennis rules published
.
by the Yorktown IBM Club reminds us that “Proper
.
footware is required (tennis shoes/sneakers)”.
forecast n. A prophecy of the number of sales of a
product as a function of price at which it will be
offered.
This is typically made by people who have
never used or sold such products and based upon [wild]
guesses by some people who have. The forecast has no
relationship to either the quality of the product or the
value as it might be perceived by the potential customer,
since the forecasters are not the people allowed to
discuss the product with the customer at this stage.
Thus a forecast is either strikingly inaccurate for a low
price and large number of sales, or a painfully self-
fulfilling prophecy if it is high priced and low volume.
forest fire n. Something bad that happens, such as a
manufacturing problem or a machine crash, that receives
an undue amount of attention from high-level manage-
ment. This causes productive work to cease as all avail-
able personnel become firefighters.
Fort Apache n. Building 300, East Fishkill.
The term
derives from the shape of the building, whose second
storey overhangs the first.
The term is also applied to
Building 707 in Poughkeepsie, where the windowsills
are sloped at 45 degrees so that despairing managers
will not hurt themselves or damage the building while
going out of the windows.
Fort Cottle n. Building 026, San Jose.
A large, box-
like building with gun-slit windows located at the Cottle
Road site at San Jose.
This building is considered by
many to be unfit for human occupancy, and has largely
been given over to computers.
forum n.  A file containing discussions about a given
topic on a conference disk.
(Plural usually fora.)
Usually 
a 
mix 
of 
wild 
applause, 
bug 
reports,
suggestions, questions by those who did not read the
documentation, questions by those who did (but did not
find the information wanted), and completely out-of-
topic appends.
Most forums are of considerable value,
and form perhaps the most significant method of techni-
cal communication within IBM.
Others, being cultural
rather than technical, are no less valuable but are less
obviously productive – one of the most famous is (well,
was, since it has been removed by the editor) the
BYTE8406 FORUM on the IBMPC conference.
This
spawned from a hint about a yet unannounced PC in the
June 1984 issue of Byte magazine, and degenerated into
a long compilation of stories about old hardware.
Browsing forums has become a corporation-wide occu-
pation, and is one of the favourite sports of tube-jockeys.
See

syndrome.
forumish adj. Of a file: behaving like a forum. That is,
new data are added at (appended to) the end of the file.
Frank n. The chairman of the board in the late 1970s:
Frank Cary.
“If you don’t like it, go talk to Frank”.
The term is still used to refer to the Exalted Ones At
The Top.
(The current correct term would be “John”,
but this has not found wide usage.)
. Fred n. A generic name for files, userids, etc. in exam-
.
ples. See also Panda-.
freezer n. Somewhere where ideas or idealists can safely
be stored, almost indefinitely.
Also a place where task
force results are stored (e.g., a filing cabinet to which no
one has the key).

fridge
get your ducks in a row
fridge n. A 3274 Terminal Controller.
So called
because it has the same shape, dimensions, weight, and
noise profile as a small domestic refrigerator.
friendly adj. Local. As in: “Before ordering that whizz-
bang new PC software, check it out with your friendly
legal advisor”. In no way connected with user-friendly.
frozen 1. adj. No longer open to ideas or changes.
Applied to a project that has cooled sufficiently to let
someone in power successfully quench any red-hot or
innovative idea which might be relevant to the project.
Also applied to a program that will not have any further
fixes or enhancements. See also cast-in-concrete, func-
tionally stabilized, terminate. 2. adj. Affected by a high-
level edict to “freeze headcount” (stop hiring new
employees) in a particular way.
For example:
“Westchester is frozen”.
. Frozen Zone 1. n. The period between December 15th
.
and January 15th during which no upgrades should be
.
made to the company’s systems, to allow users to finish
.
their yearly reports.
However, major bugs are usually
.
found during this period, due to the higher-than-usual
.
activity, and, of course, many machines have to be
.
installed before December 31st to avoid being debited
|
on the next year’s budget... 2. n. The period, normally
|
at the beginning of a year, in build-to-plan ordering of a
|
product when no further changes in quantities can be
|
made by the manufacturing plant.
For example, if a
|
sales area requests an increase in the shipments of a
|
BTP product, the plant may well respond that “it’s in
|
Frozen Zone – no can do”.
FRU (frew)
n. Field Replaceable Unit – a unit that is
the smallest replaceable in the field (i.e., outside a facto-
ry or reconditioning plant).
A complete logic card
might be a FRU, but a chip permanently mounted on a
card would not be. See also CRU.
FS n. Future System. A synonym for dreams that didn’t
come true. “That project will be another FS”. Note that
FS is also the abbreviation for “functionally stabilized”,
and, in Hebrew, means “zero”, or “nothing”.
Also
known as “False Start”, etc.
. FUD (fud)
n. Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.
Attributed
.
to Dr. Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to start his own
.
company, Amdahl, who alleged that “FUD is the fear,
.
uncertainty and doubt that IBM sales people instill in
.
the minds of potential customers who may be consider-
.
ing our [Amdahl] products.”
full court press n. Instruction to an entire marketing
team to press sales at an account at all levels possible.
From the basketball term.
fullword n. Four bytes (an IBM System/370 Word is 4
bytes, or 32 bits).
Many System/370 instructions run
faster when their storage operands are “aligned” on a
fullword boundary, that is, they start on an address
which is an exact multiple of four. See also halfword,
doubleword.
fun & games n. Anything that does not directly result
in short term revenue to the corporation.
function n. An undefined measure of the value of a
program or machine, in the sense of describing what it
is able to achieve.
Usage “How much added function
will we get with that line item?”
The word may be
contorted further: “How much functionality does that
have?”
functionality n. Capability, function.
functionally stabilized adj. Dead.
Said of a product
that will receive no further enhancements.
See also
frozen, sunset.
fundamental adj. Most important and basic.
The noun
qualified is to be taken as gospel and is not be ques-
tioned.
For example “The fundamental requirement is
ease of use”.
| funded adj. Of a project: formally assigned a budget,
|
possibly of funny money.
Better than a hobby (q.v.);
|
about 4 on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is strategic.
funny money 1. n. U.S. dollars used or quoted in an
internal budget or plan.
These have a hypothetical,
play-money aura – felt especially by those employees to
whom the dollar is not the native unit of currency, or
when the sums involved are very large. See also blue
money. 2. n. Test paper pieces used by engineers to test
automatic bank tellers and cash issuing terminals.
To
test the machines properly these often need to be
remarkably similar to the real thing, and hence merit
appropriate security precautions.
. GA n. General Availability.
The time at which product
.
is available (at least within one country) to anyone who
.
wishes to buy it.
This may be later than FCS (q.v.) if
.
there has been an ESP (q.v.). See also announce.
Galactic Headquarters n. The old IBM building in
New York City at 590 Madison Avenue.
This was
occupied by Corporate Headquarters before they moved
to Armonk.
It was distinguished by the old IBM logo
on the front, which was a globe with the words “World
Peace Through World Trade” on it.
(This building has
since been demolished, and has been replaced by a new
building, also owned by IBM.) The term “Galactic HQ”
now generally refers to the Armonk location.
gap n. The difference between “What The Customers
Want” and “What We Can Produce”. This term is used
by the planning community to indicate blind faith in the
ability of the Development Divisions to come up with a
product that will rectify planners’ droop and keep the
revenue growth going.
Note that it is no part of the
Planners’ responsibilities to plan whatever product might
be required, or be produced, to bridge the Gap.
. gap product n. A product conjured out of murky air in
.
the hour before the Fall Plan is due, to fill a gap in
.
revenue projections [forecasts].
Often the gap product
.
will be designed to use surplus parts from other products
.
which are in a state of decline. See also planners’ droop.
. general n. A meeting between a manager and one of his
.
or her employees for an unfocused discussion, usually of
.
a personnel rather than technical nature.
General Availability n. The time when a product is
scheduled to be available in quantity.
The sequence:
announce – ESP – FCS – General Availability normally
applies, but the exact mix varies according to the type
of product and the skills of the product planners.
In
some cases, FCS and General Availability are synony-
mous. See also customer ship.
| gerbil tubes
n. The walkways connecting various
|
buildings at the Raleigh (Research Triangle Park) site.
|
Known for their windowpanes, which can pop out when
|
there is a large inside/outside temperature differential.
get in bed with v. To work closely with. Usage: “You
will just have to get in bed with those people in
Raleigh”.
get your ducks in a row v. To get a number of people
– usually at a lower level – to provide formal approval
of a decision that has already been taken. “OK, let’s do
it. When can you get your ducks in a row?” Also, get
your ducks in order, as in: “When you escalate, be
sure you have your ducks in order, because that’s the
caboose that pushes the train”.

glasnost 
granular
. glasnost n. Openness to customer problems. By analo-
.
gy with the Russian word used to designate a “liberal”
.
policy of discussion.
When an IBMer practices
.
glasnost, the customer may get more than the Official
.
IBM Answer.
glass 1. n. Silicon chips (integrated circuits).
Usage:
“We can’t get the upleveled hardware until the new
glass gets through Fishkill”.
The reference is from the
observation that both integrated circuits and glass are
made from silicon (sand).
Originally the term Glass
referred to the photographic masters for cards or chip
transistors.
The image on the glass was projected
photographically onto photoresist on the base surface.
The 3195 had several “glass expediters” during develop-
|
ment and production.
See iron. 2. n. The cathode ray
|
tube in a display terminal. “It’s the way it looks on the
|
glass that matters.” Also used in the sense of real estate
|
(q.v.) needed for display.
“That’s a neat button design,
|
but how much glass will it use?”
glass house n. A large data processing centre or corpo-
rate information service. As in: “We haven’t been able
to find one architecture that can run from the desktop to
large glass houses”.
glass navel n. The artificial part allegedly added to
some people when they attend certain types of internal
or external education courses that are perceived by
others as a form of brain-washing.
The connotation is
that the recipient of the glass navel needs it in order to
see his or her new view of the world.
glass teletype n. Before the 3101 ASCII terminal was
announced: any non-IBM “dumb” CRT. After the 3101
was announced: the 3101.
glitch n. An electrical pulse that is shorter than most
and, more importantly, occurs where it shouldn’t.
By
definition (see pulse) it cannot be observed, and it is
therefore used as the perfect scapegoat to describe all
hardware failures in electronic equipment. It is claimed
[untruthfully] that all glitches are caused by lightning
strikes (or cosmic rays), and therefore such problems are
unavoidable.
The meaning also encompasses software
problems, to denote a weird program behaviour that
happens once and cannot be replicated.
In this case
software people prefer to blame a hardware glitch.
glove compartment n. The small space under the wrist
rest of 3278/9 keyboards where a leaflet to aid trouble-
shooting (the Problem Determination Guide) is kept. The
first place to check for a list of passwords.
GML 1. n. Generalised Markup Language.
A language
used for marking up documents (such as this one) to
show the structure and organization of the document,
rather than its appearance.
The concepts and syntax of
the original IBM GML have been generalised to form
the ISO Standard GML (SGML). 2. v. To annotate a
document with Generalised Markup Language.
“I’ve
GMLed the document so anyone can print it.”
. GMT-friendly adj. Of a computer system: having a CPU
.
clock which is correctly set to GMT, hence allowing
.
coordinated interchange of timing information with
.
systems in other time-zones. If one exchanges informa-
.
tion with a user on a GMT-hostile system, one may
.
receive files that appear to have been created at some
.
time in the future.
The future, of course, is up to 25
.
time-zones away and travelling towards you.
go away v. To vanish inexplicably. Normally used in a
kind of prayer or litany: “With a bit of luck, that prob-
lem will go away when we install Release XXX”.
go faster stripes n. Frills added to a hardware product
to make it appear to run better. IBM hardware does not
need these, of course. See also bells and whistles.
gold card n. A logic card or module claimed, by its
engineers, to be perfect.
It can be used to debug card
test programs, or for swapping with the cards in defec-
tive machines when no-one has a clue what is wrong.
See also red line card.
gold-coaster n. Someone who is “coasting” until retire-
ment.
This term is especially applied to such a person
who acquires or applies for a transfer to Boca Raton or
Tampa, in Florida. The local tourist agencies’ name for
that part of Florida is the “Gold Coast” [hence the nice
double meaning]. See also IPR, ROJ.
golden diskette n. The release version of a PC soft-
ware package. Also golden code. Usage: “Of course,
we never get to see the specs until the golden diskette is
ready to ship”.
The Personal Computer variety of
to-PID version (q.v.).
. golden handshake n. A signal (originally in the form
.
of a handshake, but now sometimes simply music
.
played over the public address system) from a manager
.
to his or her employees, made on the day before a major
.
public holiday (such as Thanksgiving, in the USA).
It
.
signifies “have a good holiday” and implies “you are
.
now free to leave early today, if you wish”.
This
.
phenomenon seems to be USA only, and (judging by
.
recent memos) has been over-used in some places.
A
.
reader tells of a colleague who, before every holiday,
.
used to trace his hand on paper, cut out the tracing, tape
.
it to a ruler, and then thrust it out of his office door
.
every time his manager went by.
Others tell of times
.
when their manager didn’t know of this convention, and
.
the department remained in their offices for hours after
.
everyone else had left.
.
“Golden Handshakes” in the form of a joining or
.
leaving present used not to be used in IBM, though they
.
have now crept in under the guise of FAPs.
golf ball n. The removable typing element that was used
in the Selectric typewriter and the 105x series of
System/360 consoles.
This typing element is roughly
spherical and is covered with the characters that can be
printed.
Different fonts (such as Courier, Dance
Symbols, Eskimo, etc.) are available on different golf
balls. “When your program issues the WTO macro, the
system will jiggle the golf ball and print the message.”
[A salesman of the old guard would, of course, refer to
“rotating and tilting the typing element”.]
Golf Ball typewriters are no longer sold by IBM.
goodness 1. n. A measure of a project’s worth, used to
justify its continued existence when no rational reasons
can be found. “This system contributes goodness to the
user environment”.
See also bad information. 2. n. An
item that is well esteemed, and unlikely to be unpopular
with anyone.
[Like Apple Pie?] “This project is Good-
ness.”
. Gor n. A non-specific place name.
From the titles of a
.
series of “science” fantasy novels by one John Norman
.
(John Frederick Lange). It was first used in IBM in the
.
names of “generic” PC adventure games, such as “Giant
.
Rabbits of Gor”, but has since spread to other environ-
.
ments.
go to the mat v. To fight it out by going to higher
authority. From the wrestling term. See escalate.
. gotta minute? interjection. “Please come to my office
.
right now.” [Some snooper found a demonstration appli-
.
cation program on one of your disks.]
granular
adj. Patchy, narrow minded.
In certain
locations, to refer to another person’s thinking as “gran-
ular” is a subtle suggestion that it is suspect.
One is
encouraged these days to take a “system view” of
thoughts and ideas, where the whole is somehow greater
than the sum of its (highly granular) parts.

granularity 
groove-swing
granularity 1. n. A term with an indeterminate mean-
ing.
Perhaps “bittiness”, by analogy with the grains of
silver halide in a photographic emulsion. Usage (Quote
from MVS/XA: An Overview, GG22-9303, page 10):
“Read-only protection is now on a page granularity”.
2. n. A substitute for the word “specificity”, in the
sense “a specific item or detail”.
Usually coupled with
descriptors such as “sufficient” or “a lack of”, and in
this case used mainly to discredit someone else’s work.
Not to be confused with granulated. 3. n. Being able to
fence out (of a configuration) a failing element of a
processor complex so the remaining elements can
continue to do useful work.
For example, in the 3081
one of the two central processors can be fenced out and
the other, in conjunction with the rest of the elements,
can continue to run as a single processor system.
Also
on the 3081 processor, a pair of BSMs (Basic Storage
Modules) can be fenced out, powered down, repaired,
powered up, tested, and returned to the operating config-
uration.
Thus high granularity implies many elements
that can be fenced out, and low granularity implies few
elements that can be fenced out.
Great Oral Tradition n. The explanation for why so
many pieces of widely used, basic, or important infor-
mation are not to be found recorded anywhere, despite
the existence of several forests’ worth of manuals and
Gigabytes of on-line documentation.
One theory holds
that since widely used information should be intuitively
obvious to newcomers to the corporation, writing it
down is a waste of time. In addition, such material is in
a constant state of flux, which only reinforces the argu-
ment of the futility of documentation.
[Perhaps this
poor dictionary will continue to help those in such
need.]
. Great Runes n. Expressions using only uppercase char-
.
acters. Nowadays used mostly by megalomaniac operat-
.
ing systems and compilers, and by users discovering
.
their very first desk-top publishing system.
green card n. Quick reference summary information
printed on a large folded sheet of heavy paper, usually
yellow or white.
This refers to the original (green)
System/360 reference card which is an outstanding
example of the genre.
Some recent “cards” are in fact
booklets – which of course tends to defeat the object of
providing a quick reference.
|
The original green card became a yellow card when
|
the System/370 was introduced, and soon was published
|
as a (yellow) booklet.
With the introduction of XA
|
(q.v.), it has become a 48-page pink book.
A fine anecdote refers to a scene that took place in a
programmers’ terminal room at Yorktown in 1978.
A
physicist, using a terminal there, overheard one of the
programmers ask another “Do you have a green card?”.
The other grunted, and passed the first a thick yellow
booklet.
At this point the physicist turned a delicate
shade of olive and rapidly left the room, never [it’s said]
to return. See also card.
. green cloud n. Dollars budgeted for but unspent at the
.
end of the year.
There is a very strong incentive to
.
spend such funds, regardless of any expense cuts or
.
exhortations to economise that may have been received.
.
If you don’t spend the money, your organisation will be

.
next year, either.
| green ink n. Any part of a software product (that is
|
itself part of the Systems Application Architecture, SAA)
|
that does not conform to the SAA definition. So called
|
from the use of green ink in the manuals describing
|
such products; deviations from the architecture are
|
printed in green ink.
Informally extended to the
|
concepts of “light green” and “dark green” – deviations
|
from the architecture that will be easy or hard to correct
|
in the future, respectively. See also green words.
| green layer n. Application enabling (support) software.
|
See layer.
green lightning n. Apparently random flashing streaks
written on the face of the 3278 and 3279 terminals
while a programmable symbol set is being loaded. This
hardware bug was not fixed, as some bright spark
suggested that this “would let the user know that some-
thing is happening”.
[It certainly does.] See also light-
ning bolt.
. green machine n. A piece of hardware designed or
.
modified to meet U.S.
Government military specifica-
.
tions (milspecs). The name is derived from the observa-
.
tion that the U.S. Army used to paint most of its
.
property a drab olive-green colour.
Usually refers to
.
equipment produced or modified by the Federal Systems
.
Division.
| green money n. See blue money.
. green sheet 1. n. The Travel Expense Allowance
.
(TEA) multi-part form used in the USA to submit
.
expenses for reimbursement. The only IBM form in the
.
USA (and possibly in the world) that was printed on
.
green paper (now in green ink), possibly to remind the
.
user that it deals with “real” money.
Usage: “Just go
.
out and buy it and we’ll put it on the green sheet”.
.
2. v. To submit an expense for repayment.
“Go ahead
.
and green-sheet that item.” 3. n. A sheet of ceramic,
.
with binder, that is used in the manufacture of integrated
.
circuit chip carriers.
These are pale green, with a
.
texture rather like a thin vinyl sheet.
green words n. A widely used but now obsolete
FORTRAN term for “parochial control words used to
delimit spanned records in the absence of adequate data
management support”.
During a presentation in which
these words were first identified, they were diagrammed
on a blackboard in green chalk, thus the name.
It is
reported that the Green words are the Block and Record
Descriptor Words (length fields) that are present even
today in RECFM=V, VB, and VBS data sets in MVS.
See for example the section Variable-Length Records in
OS/VS2 MVS Data Management Services Guide,
GC26-3875-1, pages 9-15.
FORTRAN programmers
needed to know about these in order to calculate the
proper LRECL and BLKSIZE values, and many were
accustomed to “adding 4 to get LRECL and 4 more to
get BLKSIZE,” thus producing unblocked disk-eating
horrors. See also green ink.
| grey elephant n. The Model 407 accounting machine.
|
So named because of its size, colour [all IBM machines
|
in those days were grey], and ponderous operation. This
|
machine was programmed using a plug board and patch
|
wires, by a person known as a board wirer (q.v.).
. grommet n. A small, black, rectangular piece of rubber
.
(without a hole in it) that is used to prevent magnetic
.
tape unravelling from its reel. See also sugar cube.
groove-swing n. (Meaning obscure.)
This term was
used repeatedly in a 1984 talk by a high-level personnel
person as part of the persuasion patter intended to
convince engineers that they were Executive Resources.
The speaker could not believe that the engineers did not
see executives as the highest form of life in IBM, so
phrases like “the groove-swing leads right to the power
curve” flew fast and furious.
The speaker didn’t seem
to know what the terms meant, and the audience certain-
ly had no idea, so a proper definition will have to wait
for later enlightenment.
[Groove-swing is probably
from the golfing term, as in the usage “He’s doing it so
easily, he must be in a grooved swing”.]

growth 
hex
growth v. To be grown, or to be extended. As in: “The
most interesting characteristic of these new processors is
their ability to growth to up to 2 MB of main storage”.
guru n. A professional expert.
There is significant
difference between a “guru” (who can invent new
incantations), and a “wizard” (who can only use
incantations already invented).
Guru is overtly a term
of respect, but can sometimes convey an undertone of
contempt for one who would invest large amounts of
time in a subject which the speaker does not consider
sufficiently important to learn well himself. See also
expert.
halfword n. Two bytes (an IBM System/370 Word is 4
bytes, or 32 bits). Especially confusing term when used
to describe a 16-bit data item on a 16-bit machine
whose “word-length” is 16 bits.
See also fullword,
doubleword.
Hall of Winds n. See Cave of the Winds.
| hall talk n. Gossip, especially concerning information
|
that is widely known and/or believed but has not yet
|
been announced formally by the management team. The
|
term derives from the favoured locale for such talk (in
|
office hallways, near rest areas and vending machines).
|
As in: “There is hall talk that we will have to slip the
|
schedule”.
hamster n. An incorrectly attached (or, more usually,
detached) wire in a computer system.
This is a local
reference to the hamster, belonging to one C. Moon,
which all unknowingly chewed through electric wiring
at home.
handshake v. To communicate with the proper protocol.
Normally used to indicate that two computers have been
connected successfully, as in: “OK, the boxes are hand-
shaking now”.
hands-on 1. n. Time spent in exploration of a new
piece of equipment.
“After the class we will go down
to the DP Centre for some hands-on.” 2. n. Physical
access to equipment.
“I have the programs written, but
I can’t get any hands-on until Thursday.”
| hard disk, hard file n. A magnetic storage disk which
|
is hard (not floppy), and usually is not easily removable
|
from the machine in which it is installed. See file, fixed
|
disk, floppy disk.
hardwire v. To code as a constant value something that
one would normally like to be a changeable parameter.
From hardware-wired.
“The Userid of the receiving
machine is hardwired as DATASTAG”. “The spool
space constant is hardwired at 53%”.
(An alternative
term is hardcode).
he n. A huge computer program (e.g., MVS, HSM, JES)
which does things on your behalf, usually without your
knowledge, and sometimes without your control.
Perhaps originally an indirect reference to the program-
mer, but now refers to the program – which seems to
take on the personality of an unnamed and devilishly
cunning person when its side effects (the ones that are
causing you problems) are being explained to you by
another. “He dynamically retrieves the datasets that you
will need and puts them on a scratch pack”.
Sexist
programmers slip in the term “She” from time to time,
either for variety or when the action taken by the system
seems especially fickle.
. head n. The part of a hard disk drive mechanism that
.
contains the coil that actually reads or writes informa-
.
tion on the disk.
This part “flies” on a film of air,
.
extremely close to the disk; hence the risk of a head
.
crash. See also fixed head.
headcount n. The number of personnel currently allo-
cated to a manager or project (whether or not the allo-
cation is filled by warm bodies).
Headcount is the
primary measure of the size of a person’s empire or the
importance of a project, and is therefore increased
whenever possible. Unfortunately it is a common belief,
among those who allocate resources, that nine women
can produce a baby in one month.
head crash n. An event in which a read/write head
forgets how to fly over the surface of a magnetic disk,
and gouges up priceless data.
headshape v. To alter another person’s opinion on a
subject.
Permission from the other person is not
required (and probably not available).
There is even a
non-verbal form in which the shaper grasps the object’s
imagined head by the ears, using the fingers and palms,
and then massages the object’s head with the thumbs.
Neither the term nor the gesture should be used in the
presence of one whose head is to be shaped.
hear v. To understand and sympathise with.
Invariably
followed by “but”, as in: “I hear you, but there just isn’t
time to fix that problem”.
This usage probably derives
from Erhard Seminars Training (est) 1971 jargon.
heat n. Reprobation from on high. “If we can’t ship this
on schedule, we are going to take a lot of heat”.
Note
that being cold-blooded helps one withstand heat.
See
also help.
help 1. n. Something provided by headquarters staff,
especially during times of difficulty.
Often this term is
used in conjunction with the observation that “If we
don’t improve this product plan, we will get more Help
.
than we can imagine”. Alternatively, it may be heard in
.
“I’m from the region / plant / headquarters and I’m
.
here to help”.
See also 
external
audit,
heat.
2. n. On-line explanatory or reference material. Usage:
“The program seems to work OK, but the helps are
awful”.
Or: “The help didn’t tell me there is an arbi-
trary restriction on the number of items a list tag can
contain in a NAMES file”.
. hero territory n. A marketing environment or sector
.
where it is very easy to make a name for yourself but
.
where you run a real risk of visible failure. The chance
.
of an assignment to hero territory is often introduced by
.
management with the phrase “Have I got an opportunity
.
for you...”.
hex adj or n. Hexadecimal, or base-16. An alternative to
the term “sexadecimal”. This latter term was popular in
the early days of programming, when the abbreviation
was a source of gentle amusement among those few
specialists who wrote programs.
With the more wide-
spread use of computing at the time of System/360,
IBM invented the safely laundered term “hex”.
Not
intended as a curse or incantation, frequent evidence to
the contrary notwithstanding.
In fact, neither “hexadecimal” nor “sexadecimal” was
derived logically.
The original term for the base 10
system was “denary system”, from the Latin partitioning
number, denarius. However, the term “decimal system”
became popular for base 10, while “binary system” was
accepted for base 2.
When it came time to invent a
name for base 16, engineers with little Latin and less
Greek stuck a randomly chosen word for six from either
Latin sexa- or Greek hexa- to the word decimal to create
the mongrel word hexadecimal.
A morphologically
correct Latin word for “sixteen each”, corresponding to
“binary” or “denary”, would perhaps be “senidenary”.
If the term were to end in “decimal”, then the correct
prefix would be sexti-, as in “sextidecimal”.
27

hexit
how hard would it be
hexit n. Hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F).
Calling this set
of base-16 numbers “digits” sounds bizarre, since they
have more elements than you can count on your fingers
(unless you are involved in keyboard design).
. hiccup n. A file duplicated by a network following a
.
transmission error.
This is usually due to a forwarding
.
program resending a file when acknowledgement of
.
receipt of the original copy fails to arrive, even though
.
the original copy did arrive.
. hidden agenda n. The true purpose of a meeting or
.
announcement.
“To maintain integrity, all Software
.
Change Requests will be signed off by executive
.
management.”
The hidden agenda in this proposal is:
.
“We don’t want to see any more changes”.
high level 1. adj. Global rather than local (describing a
view of a business situation). 2. adj. Having at least
three levels of subordinate managers.
3. adj. Of a
modification or change to a product or plan: having no
real value, but added to impress higher management.
As in: “This is a high-level feature”. See also bells and
whistles. 4. adj. Of no real substance, or purely rheto-
rical.
As in “a high level discussion”.
This usage is
possibly derived from the term “high-brow”.
highlight v. To emphasise, or make a point of.
From
the most common form of emphasis available on older
display terminals, in which the words to be emphasised
are brighter than the other information on the display.
Highlighting on displays now encompasses such diverse
forms of emphasis as underscores, reverse video, and
(painful) blinking – but no longer intensification.
hit 1. n. An error in hardware or software. “My system
took three hits before it crashed”. See check. 2. n. A
Slip caused by an unsatisfied external dependency.
Usage: “I’ve got a [schedule] hit because of XYZ slip-
page”. A highly desirable way to decommit, as it saves
face. See also bad information. 3. n. A success in
searching for something.
“Every time a cache hit
occurs, we save three cycles”. 4. v. To press (a key or
button), as in: “Please hit ENTER”.
Now discouraged,
as it is considered to be a word that might disturb the
sensitive user.
“Press” is the preferred verb, with
“Touch” a near second.
| hobby n. A project outside a manager’s normal line of
|
responsibility which can be pursued without using
|
enough resource to attract attention.
Depending upon
|
the level and charisma of the manager concerned,
|
hobbies can easily involve dozens of people. If discov-
|
ered prematurely, a hobby is quickly packaged as adtech
|
and held to be an example of the innovation and
|
entrepreneurship that makes a company successful.
. HOBit, hobbit (hobbit)
n. High Order Bit; the most
.
significant (leftmost) bit in bit-organised data.
hokey dial n. A means of connecting terminals over a
switched-line network (usually the public telephone
system), when the terminals concerned are designed to
work only on a permanently connected (“leased”) line.
To achieve this, the user manually dials the connection
and then starts up
the communications, and the hard-
ware at each end hopefully cannot detect the difference.
Used as emergency fall-back in some cases where the
dedicated lines fail; also used as a cheap substitute for
proper lines. National communication authorities do not
always approve.
(Also called pseudo-leased).
[The
word “Hokey” comes from the sham Latin “Hocus” (as
in hocus-pocus, a magician’s formula or trickery), which
can also mean to cheat or stupify with drink.]
home-grown adj. Of software: written for internal use
and hence not formally supported. Of course, this soft-
ware is often at least as well supported as product code,
but even so the description “home-grown” is often used
as an excuse for not using new and innovative tools. See
NIH, type one.
HONEhead 1. n. One of a select few in the Branch
Office who, through the use of the office HONE
(Hands-On Network Environment) terminal, can always
find the answer to even the most obscure question. The
first symptom usually noted is frequent missing of lunch
to scrounge for new Product announcements on the
system.
Hard cases have at least one userid on every
HONE machine in the network. 2. n. A member of the
HONE system support staff who believes that the
answer to every question should be on the HONE
system, and that there should be a minimum of five
menus associated with finding any answer.
hook 1. n. A piece of hardware or software which is
added to a product to allow future extensions or addi-
tions, but which is not necessary for the basic function.
Unless designed very carefully, hooks can disclose
planned but unannounced features.
For example, many
well labelled hooks in the System/370 Model 145 micro-
code revealed a thing called Virtual Memory.
Now for
Quality’s sake, hooks must be fully tested by the manu-
facturing department involved. 2. n. The character “?”,
a question mark. Generally used by PC bigots, since in
the old BASIC language the hook could be used to pull
the value of a variable out of the otherwise intractable
interpreter. See also shriek, splat.
hop n. An electronic network connection between two
adjacent nodes. This is used as a measure of the logical
distance between two nodes, as opposed to the
geographical distance.
This distance is a good indi-
cation of the likely file transmission delay (netlag),
which is closely correlated with the number of times
that the file will be stored and then forwarded.
Some
machine rooms feature systems which are three or four
hops apart, even though you can’t open the doors of one
of the mainframes without first closing those of the
other one.
. horizontal adj. Broad or wide. See vertical.
hot and heavy adj. Intensive, hard and steady.
Used
frequently [and, apparently, quite innocently] at a
Minnesota location to describe intensive work to meet a
deadline.
As in: “We’ve been going hot and heavy on
this for six months now”.
hot button n. A topic currently of great interest to
someone who matters (i.e., some big-shot).
Implies
impermanence, and some contempt.
The hot button of
today is likely to be of only minor interest tomorrow.
Current examples: ease-of-use, Quality.
hot 
key 
1. n. A 
keystroke 
(or 
combination 
of
keystrokes) that switches environments.
On the PC,
terminal emulators often have a hot key to swap
between the PC-DOS environment and the host environ-
ment.
In System/370 jargon those keys are sometimes
referred to as “Program Access” keys.
These keys are probably called “hot” because they are
always active. Certainly if pressing them has no effect,
the underlying program or machine can be somewhat
cold. 2. v. To switch environments.
how hard would it be adv. A plaintive litany used
when venturing suggestions for changes.
Immediately
precedes some preposterously difficult proposal which to
the requestor (and any other reasonable person) seems
simple.
From experienced users, a wry acknowledge-
ment that the proposition may well be costly, but is
nevertheless desirable.
“How hard would it be to
remove the length restriction on userids?” See also
WIBNI.

Hudson River Valley Works
Information Support Staff
Hudson River Valley Works n. IBM.
Much of the
Hudson River Valley, in New York State, is influenced
by IBM.
There are major IBM locations throughout
Westchester County, and at East Fishkill, Poughkeepsie,
and Kingston.
huff v. To compress data using a frequency dependent or
Huffman code.
“If the data won’t fit in the record, we
can always huff it.” The abbreviation derives from the
first of a pair of programs written in the 1970s to
compress and restore data, delightfully named HUFF
and PUFF.
hung 1. adj. Not responding to requests.
As in: “The
system seems to be hung now”. The term derives from
telecommunications; a computer that drops the telephone
line to a user’s terminal is said to have hung up the line
(as though it had hung up the receiver on a telephone
handset). 2. adj. Waiting, queued. An excuse for “lost”
electronic mail files. As in: “Your file must be hung at
some intermediate node”.
IBM 1. n. International Business Machines. [In case you
really didn’t know; many don’t.] 2. n. A hypothetical
370 instruction, existence strongly suspected but not yet
proven: “Insert Bug under Mask”. 3. n. Immense Blue
Mountain (or Monolith). 4. n. I’ve Been Moved, allud-
ing to the favourite game of departmental and divisional
reorganisations.
5. n. It’s
Better
Manually.
6. n. Hudson River Valley Works.
Much of that valley,
in New York State, is owned by IBM.
IBM Confidential adj. Only accessible to IBM employ-
ees who can claim a need to know. This may be propri-
etary information relating to personnel or technical
matters, or information that could be embarrassing to
IBM. See also candy-striped, Poughkeepsie Confidential,
Registered IBM Confidential.
. IBM discount n. A price increase. This term is said to
.
have been coined in Poughkeepsie, and refers to the
.
belief that residents in an area with a large IBM popu-
.
lation end up overpaying for goods and services.
IBMer
n. An 
employee 
of 
International 
Business
Machines. See also Beamer, Beemer.
IBM Internal Use Only adj. Proprietary to IBM, but
may be shown to (but not left with) non-IBMers.
Sometimes, information that is confidential but which
the classifier does not wish to, or cannot, keep locked
away.
IBMJARG n. A document which lists numerous “jargon”
terms used within IBM.
(This document.)
See also
 recursive.
IBMois (ee-bay-aym-wa)
n. A strange French dialect
spoken mostly around Paris, Nice, Bordeaux, and
Montpellier.
Although it bears some relationship to
Franglais, it goes a step further by using French words
with an improper meaning (addresser, delayer, eligi-
ble...).
Note also that some of those words are often
misspelt from the French (addresser should be adresser,
for instance).
ibmox (eye-bee-em-ox, ib-em-ox, or ib-mox)  v. To copy
xerographically.
“I Xeroxed a copy – sorry, I ibmoxed
a copy of that report for you.” Also ibmrox.
IC (eye-see)
n. Information Centre.
No, not Integrated
Circuit!
Since Information Centres replaced the DP
shop as the place to go for programming assistance, it
has been decreed that “IC” no longer means “integrated
circuit”.
icon 1. n. A sequence of characters used in computer
conferencing to add emphasis or to convey the writer’s
tone-of-voice (also known as an emotion icon or
emoticon). For example, the sequence
 
:-)
(when viewed sideways) looks like a smiling face and
hence warns the reader that a comment is meant lightly
or sarcastically.
A poor substitute for properly written
|
language, but convenient and widely used.
2. n. A
|
small symbol for a program or for data. [These are not
originally IBM terms, but are included here due to their
wide usage.]
| iconize, iconicize v. To render, change, or otherwise
|
cause the appearance of an area of displayed data on a
|
screen to be transformed into a (usually smaller)
|
symbol, known as an icon, for the original data (or for
|
the program which presented that data).
I didn’t change anything interjection. “Something has
changed but I have no idea what”.
Also I didn’t
change a card. Plaintive cry preceding feelings of the
cold pricklies.
The proper reply to this cry is: “Then it
works just the same as it did before, right?” See also
one-line fix.
. IEHIBALL 
(eye-ee-aitch-eye-ball)
n. A 
data
.
compare/scanning utility to be used when all the normal
.
utilities prove to be inadequate. For example, “The only
.
way to check that is to run it through the IEHIBALL
.
utility”.
[This is a pun, based on the observation that
.
the names of many OS utilities start with the prefix
.
“IEH”.]
IHR n. In-House Retiree.
Hudson Valley variety of IPR
(q.v.).
impact See hit.
incantation n. A small piece of source code that
appears in most programs written in a given language.
Most programmers will use the sequence out of habit,
and often without thought or understanding in the hope
that it will ward off evil spirits and bugs. One example
is:
 
BALR
*,R12
 
USING R12,*
The term is also used for any piece of expert manipu-
lation required of a user or reader to get access to a
privileged system function or information.
incent v. To motivate with the carrot. [A horrible term,
but perhaps it is preferable to “Incentivize”!]
. increase n. An addition to one’s salary.
“Your
.
performance will have a direct effect on your increase.”
incredible adj. A famous memo issued by FE manage-
ment suggested the word “Incredible” as a possible
alternative to the term “Bull” and its derivatives, which
apparently was being over-used in meetings. Thereafter,
the exclamation “Incredible!” could be heard ringing
through the halls, accompanied by merriment from those
understanding the translation, and expressions of bewil-
derment from the others.
. individual n. Person.
As in: “Several individuals are
.
upset by this”. IBM always respects the individual.
inflatable buildings n. Temporary buildings.
A term
used in Poughkeepsie (where there are lots of them)
because they go up so fast.
Information Asset Security n. The protection of
ideas, programs, information, and inventions. Also used
(usually as the abbreviation IAS) to refer to the people
involved in enforcing this protection. See security.
Information Support Staff n. A group of people
alleged to exist in various locations to help other
IBMers actually get computer access. A rule of thumb:
if the telephone number is published, then whoever
answers will most likely be unable to help. (There is a
general truth here: someone with real skills will have
moved on to something better.
And will not publicise
his or her telephone number as then it would be impos-
sible to get any work done.)

. inspection n. A meeting in which the design or imple-
.
mentation of a product or document is reviewed in
.
detail. Generally, there are three levels of inspection for
.
a product.
The first, usually called “I0” (eye-zero),
.
takes place when the specifications of the product are
.
complete.
The I1 inspection reviews the design of the
.
product.
The I2 checks the actual implementation (in
.
the case of a code inspection, every line of code is
.
scrutinised).
An inspection is chaired by a Moderator
.
(usually from a Product Assurance department) and
.
comprises the author or authors of the object being
.
inspected together with at least an equal number of inde-
.
pendent reviewers.
| install n. The process of installing a machine, including
|
making connections to it, loading any required software,
|
and testing the completed installation.
As in: “Who’s

doing the install?”
| intelligent adj. Programmed or programmable.
The
|
document:
IBM 
Publications 
Guideline: 
Style
|
(ZZ27-1970-0) prohibits use of this adjective in external
|
publications.
It recommends the use of “programmed”
|
instead.
For instance, one should not write: “This

interactive adj. Modern. Usually associated with typing
at CRT display terminals.
Supposed to carry the
connotation of fast, pleasant, and making full use of
“modern” techniques and technology.
Usage: “Of
course, we will follow up with an interactive version”.
interface 1. v. (Of humans) To talk.
“I’m going to
interface to Joe Bleh, the new DP Manager”. 2. v. (Of
machines) To connect. “I’m going to interface the black
box to the [big] blue box”. 3. n. A legally defined and
documented place on an IBM machine or program
where someone can attach another machine or program,
of any manufacture. Programmers often call this a user
exit.
Interim Plan n. Two Interim Plans (Summer and
Winter) are placed between the Spring Plan and the Fall
Plan.
These plans are timed in order a) to review and
refine the hurried results of the previous Spring or Fall
Plan, b) to add project items “forgotten” in the previous
plan (now that no one is looking), and c) to ensure full
employment of the bureaucrats responsible for devising
the plans.
| internal adj. Internal or proprietary to IBM.
Usage:
|
“We use the internal version of that – don’t you?”
. interrupt n. An event that interrupts the normal flow of

in: “I’m in interrupt mode all the time these days; never
.
get a chance to do anything creative”.
IPL (eye-pee-ell)
v. To Initial Program Load. To restart
“from square one” after an operating system has

“She IPLs on coffee each morning”.
Also IMPL (Initial Micro Program Load – now an obso-
lete term), or IML (Initial Microcode Load).
IML was
originally known as “Initial Minnow Load”, Minnow
being the code name for the floppy disk drive on the
370/145 computer.
IPR (eye-pee-are)
n. In-Plant Retiree.
Someone who
has stopped doing any visible work, but has not done
|
anything wrong so cannot be fired.
In the Japanese
|
vernacular this is a “person with a window seat” or a
|
“newspaper reader”. When it was difficult to to fire an
|
employee who had retired in place, they were “assigned
|
a window seat” to get them out of the way.
In one
|
sales office this usage caught on, and over time the
|
adage to “lead, follow or get out of the way” evolved
|
into “lead, follow or catch some rays”.
Not to be
confused with intellectual property rights, another
(1985) meaning for the abbreviation. See also ROJ, gold-
coaster, IHR.
IPV (eye-pee-vee)
n. Intra-Plant Vacation.
This is
usually a long walk around the work location (plant) to
let tempers cool and common sense prevail.
Usage: “I
think I’ll go take an IPV”. [This is also used as a verb,
but such usage is likely to be misunderstood.]
iron n. Computing machinery.
Prevalent among hard-
ware people to describe “boxes” (blue or otherwise).
Hence pour iron, as in: “To some degree, we can ‘pour
iron’ on the problem”. See also big iron, micro iron, old
iron, pig iron, push iron, rusty iron, tired iron.
ironmonger n. A derogatory term used by some “pure”
software people to designate hardware people. One who
makes or sells iron.
This usage generally indicates that
the speaker is ignorant about hardware matters.
Iron Mountain n. Permanent “vital records” document
storage.
“We’ll send these files to Iron Mountain”.
Originally, a vendor specialising in securing backup
documentation against nuclear attack; now any archival
storage. Not a good place to put data you ever want to
use again. See also Wansdyke, Salt Mine.
IS (eye-ess)
n. Information Systems.
The department
that manages the computer installations at many IBM
sites.
Optimists thought it stood for “Information
Services” until they became users.
issue n. A formal indication from one group to another
that the first is dissatisfied with some action by the
other, and is prepared to take the matter to the next
level of management to resolve the problem. Issues are
often 
solutioned.
See 
also 
concern,
exposure,
non-concur.
Ivan Fredin Expressway n. The series of corridors
that connect buildings at the Endicott Plant at the third
floor level.
One can cover more than 600 meters in a
straight path running through seven buildings; it can
take 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other.
Ivan Fredin was the Endicott Plant General Manager in
the 1960s.
ivory letter n. See blue letter.
| jaws chart n. A planning graph portraying time on the
|
horizontal axis against resources or volumes, etc., on the
|
vertical axis.
Two lines, representing the planned or
|
projected requirement and the actual resources available,
|
inevitably leave a wedge-shaped gap reminiscent of an
|
alligator’s open jaws.
This delta (q.v.) is often labelled

JCL 
KISS Principle
|
by the lower echelons as “shortfall” and by senior
|
management as “opportunity”.
JCL n. Job Control language.
This was one of IBM’s
earliest attempts to make computing easy – JCL has
only five command verbs.
Unfortunately, one of these
verbs has grown to have at least 192 different modifiers.
[Probably 200, by the time you read this!] See command
language.
JESplex (jezz-plecks)
n. Another word for CEC, the
central electronics complex of olden days.
JES stands
for Job Entry Subsystem.
This is heard frequently on
Myers Corners Road, in Poughkeepsie, where some
people still fondly believe that all mainframes run the
MVS/JES operating system.
(In fact, it’s fewer than
half.)
job rotation n. Moving people from one job to another.
A management strategy commonly used when a new
and creative manager takes over a department that has
many people who have been sitting at the same desk for
too long.
A policy of job rotation is initiated, so that
the old hands can be moved to new jobs (usually good
for them and for the company).
Unfortunately, for
consistency, the rotation rules also have to be applied to
the new blood that replaces them, and the resulting inse-
curity is not always advantageous.
joggle v. To shake or disturb slightly.
Once used to
describe the technique for squaring up a deck of
punched cards, it now refers to agitating a person into
doing a task or making a decision.
joint study n. A study made in conjunction with a
customer to try out a program or piece of hardware
during the development cycle.
This is one of the best
ways to ensure the quality of a product, as it gets used
by real users.
The customer gets the benefit of having
his problems solved earlier than he might otherwise
expect, and IBM gets the benefit of hearing about the
customer’s experiences (so long as somebody listens).
| jumper 1. n. A removable small wire or plug connect-
|
ing two pins that modifies an electrical circuit to affect
|
some function.
For example, to change the address by
|
which a peripheral device is known. Now largely super-
|
seded by micro switches and “software jumpers”.
|
2. v. To place or remove one or more jumpers. As in:
|
“Is this card jumpered for high speed or low speed?”
k, K adj. 1000 or 1024. The lower-case “k” is the inter-
nationally agreed abbreviation for the prefix “kilo” (as
in kilometre, kilogram, meaning 1000 metres or 1000
grams). The upper-case “K” is never the correct abbre-
viation for “kilo”, and has come to mean the number
1024 (two to the power of 10).
Computer memory
(storage) is addressed by binary encoding so this is a
convenient unit, close to the familiar 1000. Hence 64K
+ 64K = 128K (= 131k, approximately). See also m, M.
kahuna (ka-hoo-na) 
1. n. A Hawaiian witch doctor.
2. n. An expert in some narrow field of endeavour, or
one who runs things.
A top expert is a big kahuna.
(Kahunas have much understanding of the conflict of
“K” versus “k”.) See also guru.
. Katzenbox n. A corrugated cardboard records box
.
(approximately 280mm by 305mm by 400mm).
These
.
once had “IBM” printed on all four sides, but now only
.
have print on one end, stating DIV NO., DEPT NO.,
.
and BOX NO. .. OF .. .
The name originated in
.
January 1969 when the U.S.
Government brought anti-
.
trust charges against the IBM Corporation claiming that
.
IBM had a monopoly in the data processing industry.
.
Thereafter, tons of papers purported to show the way
.
IBM conducted business in the USA had to be stored as
.
evidence by order of IBM’s chief counsel Nicholas
.
deB. Katzenbach.
The boxes are now used mainly for
.
moving possesions between offices, or for permanent
.
temporary storage. Also Katzenbach box.
| Kenmore Card n. The first edition of the System/370
|
Extended Architecture Reference Summary, which had
|
its title laid out so it accidentally spelled out “SEARS”.
|
“Kenmore” is the brand name for a number of Sears’
|
products.
key adj. Important.
Derived from the old term “key
part” in theatre, it is used when the speaker cannot
explain why it is important. “It’s absolutely key.”
keyboard v. To enter data by pressing buttons on a
computer input device.
This was originally used to
describe the work of card punch operators, now applied
to any relatively large scale data entry work.
“We are
keyboarding the Oxford English Dictionary in Florida.”
. key off and key on v. To reset a machine by the use of
.
its on/off key. This does not necessarily remove power
.
from the machine, but may well re-initialise its hardware
.
and software. Usage: “Why don’t you key off and key
.
on that 6670 and see if that fixes it?” See also Big Red
.
Switch, POR, Poughkeepsie reset, power cycle.
| keys to the kingdom n. The access authority that
|
allows control of special, usually privileged, functions in
|
an operating system. Often has the form of a password
|
needed for maintaining the system, correcting problems,
|
etc.
kick-off meetings n. An epidemic of meetings early in
the year, originally in the marketing divisions, when
senior managers seek to persuade their staff to face the
year’s challenges. Usually the only time such managers
are actually seen in the flesh (apart from award
conventions).
Can be relied upon to provide a reason-
able lunch.
In small countries kick-offs take place in the first
week of January.
In larger countries there may be a
delay of a month or more while the managers ensure
they still have jobs, and find out who the customers are,
following the latest annual reorganisation.
A modern trend is to have a minor show-business
celebrity, carefully selected for total ignorance of IBM
and its jargon, to compere [introduce and tie together
the parts of] the meeting.
This is to encourage more
attention to end users.
. kill a tree v. To generate a large quantity of printed
.
material.
A sardonic way to refer to the running of a
.
program that prints indefinitely or produces a timing
.
chart for a hardware simulation run. See also sequoia,
.
three-tree report.
. killer machine n. A service machine that checks for
.
idle userids and forces them off the system.
Killer
.
machines usually just stop other service machines (espe-
.
cially the newly installed ones which did not make it to
.
the exclusion list), since canny users quickly learn to
.
run a looping exec to avoid the chop.
King Kong adj. Of a program: large, unwieldy, and
bug-infested. See also Mickey Mouse.
kipper suffix. A measure of the speed of desk-top 370s
and minicomputers that do not manage to achieve a
million instructions per second.
A “KIP” is a thousand
(kilo-) instructions per second (see note under MIPS),
hence a “300-kipper” is a machine that runs at 0.3
MIPS.
KIPS (kips)
n. Thousands of instructions per second.
Derivative of MIPS. See also kipper.
KISS Principle n. “Keep It Simple, Stupid”.
Usually
quoted when developing a product in restricted time,
e.g., due to marketing pressures. Not usually adhered to
by software development teams, once the first release
has been shipped. This usage is distorted (or vice versa)

kit 
line management
from the marketing guideline “Keep It Short and
Simple”, intended to hone presentations.
kit 1. v. To collect in one package all the parts needed to
build some machine or subassembly. One person (rather
than an assembly line) then does the whole job of
assembling the item.
This manufacturing process is
called “kitting”. 2. n. (When used in the field) Any
piece of IBM hardware or set of boxes.
As in: “We
must get the kit in by Friday to beat the installation time
record”.
| KLOCY (kay-loc-year)
n. Thousands of lines of code
|
times the number of years that the code has been in use.
|
A measurement used in estimating service workloads.
|
See k, line of code.
. kludge (to rhyme with stooge, not fudge)  1. n. A
.
quick-and-dirty fix; a clever but inelegant solution.
.
Often applied to one’s own work in self-deprecation.
.
This is derived indirectly from the German klug, mean-
.
ing “clever”.
[This sense is not originally IBM jargon,
.
but is included here by popular demand. It is interesting
.
to note that the probability of the incorrect pronunciation
.
(to rhyme with fudge) increases with the square of the
|
distance from Cambridge, Massachusetts.] 2. n. Some-
|
thing large and complicated.
known adj. Almost ready for Announce.
As in: “Yes,
that’s a known requirement” (emphasis on “known”),
i.e., “We are working on that, but we can’t announce it
yet, so you’ll have to read between the lines”.
known restriction n. A bug which was discovered after
installation/shipment of a system, but which cannot be
described as a feature, and which is so deep in the
machinery that it will take a major re-write (and hence
be very costly) to correct.
“Yes, it wasn’t meant to
work that way. It’s a known restriction.”
| Koala 
Park
n. IBM 
Australia’s 
Headquarters 
at
|
Cumberland Forest, New South Wales. A reference to a
|
wildlife sanctuary about a kilometre away.
Koalas’
|
most favoured occupations are eating and sleeping. See
|
also Foil Factory.
. lay down v. To install a new version of a program by
.
copying it from a distribution tape to a disk.
Usage:
.
“I’ve got to lay down the new release of VM today”.
.
There is little analogy with the laying down of vintage
.
port – a given version of a program never improves with
.
age [though it may seem to throw a crust].
| layer n. A collection of hardware or software that can be
|
considered to form a layer within the structure of an
|
operating system or architecture.
Conceptually, layers
|
are smoothly overlaid on each other with a clean inter-
|
face between each, as in an onion.
Upon detailed
|
inspection, however, it will be seen that the globe
|
artichoke is often a more accurate model.
In the late
|
1980s, SAA was described in terms of a number of
|
layers, labelled by colours. See black layer, blue layer,
|
green layer, red layer, yellow layer.
layered architecture n. An Architecture in which a set
of sections is defined, each section (“layer”) represent-
ing a distinct logical function.
In theory each layer
covers (and hides) the machinery of lower layers, so you
only need to know the highest layers necessary to
perform the function you require. In practice you usual-
ly still need to know about all the layers to get anything
to work, since all the interfaces are exposed – which
rather defeats the intention.
leading-edge adj. At the forefront of innovation and
technology.
Used to describe technology that is four
years out of date and is therefore mature enough to be
used in a product.
leave the business v. To leave IBM.
See also termi-
nate.
| Legal n. The local legal department (now usually given
|
a grander name).
As in: “Better pass that by Legal
|
before using it!”
letter 
of 
understanding

| level n. A number assigned to each job or position that
|
indicates the seniority and salary scale of the employee
|
filling that position. Like salary figures, a person’s level
|
is considered a private matter unless that person wishes
|
to discuss it.
However, many job titles correspond
|
directly to specific levels.
level one n. The first level of customer support, the
person who first handles a problem. If a customer has a
real problem, he has to somehow get the level one
person to refer the problem to a real guru, the level two
support.
If IBM also considers the problem significant,
the customer may then be level two’d.
level one miracle n. An occasion when, on calling a
level one (q.v.) support group, the Level One person
solves the problem immediately.
This is becoming far
more common than it used to be as the databases and
information systems available to the support groups
continually improve. See RETAIN.
level set v. To get everyone to the same level of know-
ledge or background to be used as a base for further
progress.
That is, to give a short talk to define terms,
etc. “Before you start, let’s level set everyone”.
leverage 1. n. Commercial advantage.
As in: “We
could use bipolar or CMOS.
John, what’s the bipolar
leverage?” 2. v. To lever (upwards).
As in: “Let’s
leverage sales of our project by tying it to the others”.
lightning bolt n. A warning signal that looks like a
flash of lightning. It is used on the IBM 3270 range of
terminals to signify a communication error.
For exam-
ple “lightning bolt 505” probably means that the system
to which you are (were) connected just crashed.
Also
called shazam, a magic word used by the comic-book
figure Billy Batson; when he spoke it, lightning struck
him and transformed him into Captain Marvel. See also
green lightning.
| light pipe n. A cable made from a fibre optic bundle.
|
As in: “We’re putting a light pipe between building 24
|
and building 9”.
. limited duty sticker
n. A device added to an
.
employee’s badge to indicate a member of the Quarter
.
Century Club [open to those who have been employed
.
by IBM for 25 years or more].
. line,
the n. The boundary between storage whose
.
address is greater than or equal to 16777216 (16 Meg,
.
hexadecimal 1000000) and storage whose address is less
.
than 16777216 (below the line).
Since the original
.
System/360 architecture used short (24-bit) addresses,
.
much software was written with the assumption that no
.
addresses could be higher than 16777215.
With the
.
introduction of XA (extended architecture), some
.
machines allow 31-bit addresses, but very many
.
programs are unable to make use of the storage above
.
the line, due to earlier assumptions.
“The interpreter is
.
written for 31-bit addressing – why can’t it run above
.
the line?”
Also used to describe the 640 Kilobyte line
.
in the IBM PC address space.
line item n. A major part of a new release of a (usually
software) product. One of the highlights.
line management n. Lower levels of management.
Those levels between the speaker and the listener. “You
should take this matter up with your line management.”
As with following the line in a strictly hierarchical menu
or file system, following a management line (chain) can

linend 
m, M
often introduce delays and frustrations. See also first-line
manager, nonlinear.
| linend n. The End-Of-Line character.
In EBCDIC, each
|
line (where not directly supported by the file/storage
|
system) is ended by a single character, the linend. This
|
is equivalent to the various combinations of Carriage
|
Return and Line Feed used in ASCII.
“Linend” may
|
refer to the EBCDIC code '15'x, or it may refer to a
|
displayable character that translates to the true line end
|
(such as the number sign, also known as the hash sign,
|
pound sign, octothorpe, or tic-tac-toe sign).
line of code n. A line of a program that contains infor-
mation (i.e., excluding blank lines, etc.).
A measure of
programmer productivity or program complexity. Many
people still estimate the complexity of a program by the
number of lines of code (q.v.) that it contains. There is
certainly some approximate correlation between the
number of lines of code, the number of bugs to be
expected, and the time it takes to write the code. These
measures are more or less independent of the language
of the code, so that (for example) 1000 lines of Assem-
bler Code will take as long to write as 1000 lines of
PL/I, and be approximately as reliable (though the Func-
tion provided may be less).
Fortunately, this relation-
ship is becoming less true as languages improve and
become better engineered for human use.
The terms loc (lock, loke)  and kloc (kay-lock, kay-
loke)  are also used to refer to one or a thousand lines
of code respectively.
| link n. A network connection between two machines.
|
Usage: “Is that link down again?”
lion food n. Middle management or headquarters staff.
This usage derives from the old joke that goes some-
thing like this:
Two lions escape from a zoo and split
up to improve their chances, after agreeing to meet after
two months.
In due course they meet again.
One is
skinny, but the other is somewhat overweight.
So the
thin one asks: “How did you manage?
I ate a person
once, and they came searching the whole country for
me.
Since then, I have had to eat mice, insects, and
even grass”. “Well,” answers the obese one, “I hid near
an IBM office, and preyed a manager a day. And they
never noticed.” See also food chain.
listing 1. n. A hardcopy (paper) print-out, usually of a
program or algorithm. 2. n. The assembler- or machine-
language part of such a print-out.
load n. A person who stands in the way of production,
and who generally slows down the work rate of every-
one else.
The term is derived from electrical engineer-
ing, and corresponds to the popular “weak link” concept.
Most commonly heard in East Fishkill, as in: “That
person is a real load”.
load-and-go 1. v. To run a program in a single step
that links its components together and then runs the
complete module.
“Can you load-and-go a module in
this system?” 2. adj. Easy to get started, so that you
can just walk up and use the equipment. As in: “This is
a load-and-go system: you just load it down and go to
the phone to order more software”.
lobotomy 1. n. The process whereby employees “with
management potential” are taught the meaning of life,
management, and everything.
Commonly used by both
management and others, this term implies that the
student will, on return from the course, no longer act
like a real person and will have lost the capability of
independent action.
“I had my lobotomy last week, so
don’t ask me why – just do it.” 2. n. The logical
disconnection of the two halves of a 3084 or a 3090-400
processor.
“You mean that after it has been
lobotomized, one could IPL VM in one half and MVS
in the other?”
. locked and loaded adj. Of a disk drive: ready for use.
.
Refers to the steps involved in preparing to use a
.
removable hard disk file. First the disk is placed on the
.
drive and locked into place, and then the “Load” button
.
is pressed.
This closes the drive (if necessary), brings
.
the disk up to operating speed, and finally loads the
.
read/write head.
[A reader recalls an Army usage of
.
this term, for a rifle that was ready to fire. Unfortunate-
.
ly, since the term referred to locking a magazine of
.
twenty bullets into place, it was applicable only to an
.
M-16 rifle, and not to a Winchester.]
logo software n. PC software sold under the IBM logo
[logotype], which may or may not have been written
within IBM.
Software marketed by IBM but under a
different company logo is called non-logo. For instance,
Digital Research Dr. Logo is a non-logo Logo.
long pole in the tent n. An activity that is on, or near-
ly on, the critical path in a schedule.
When an organ-
ization is involved with other contractors in a large
project (as in Aerospace), it is Highly Undesirable for
any of that organization’s tasks to become the long pole
in the tent.
Presumably this derives from the principle
that the long pole is under the most stress, and (more
importantly) is the most visible.
“We don’t want IBM
to be the long pole in the tent on this one”.
| Lookie n. The familiar name for BookManager, an
|
online document consultation product that provides
|
documentation in softcopy form.
By analogy with
|
Bookie (q.v.).
loop n. See closed loop.
loss review n. A marketing division procedure, used to
determine why a customer selected a supplier other than
IBM. A meeting to avoid, if at all possible.
. lots of MIPS, no I/O adj. Of a person: technically bril-
.
liant but lacking in social and communications skills.
.
Literally: lots of processing power but no Input/Output.
.
See MIPS.
. low acoustics n. Quietness. From the 9370 blue letter:
.
“The rack-mountable IBM 9370 processor is uniquely
.
designed for an office environment, having low floor
.
space and power requirements, low acoustics, and an
.
attractive, modular, systems package.”
low cost application platform n. Some kind of oper-
ating system.
The exact meaning of this has not yet
been discovered; it was used in a product announcement
to refer to a System-Programmerless operating system to
which you can add other [high-cost?] program products
according to your requirements.
LSD n. An abbreviation used (in Marketing Education
classes) to refer to improper behaviour on business
premises. Stands for Liquor, Sex, and Drugs. The LSD
lecture usually comes in the second week of the first
marketing class in Dallas. One happy anecdote refers to
this item: “In 1964 my first manager was lecturing me
about the proper conduct of an IBMer (not that I espe-
cially needed it). Referring to the ‘S’ of ‘LSD’, he said
that this sort of activity was ‘forbidden on company
time or furniture’.”
[So where do little IBMers come
from?]
lunatic fringe n. In Marketing, customers who will
always take Release 1 of any new IBM product.
The
opposite of dinosaurs. See also ESP.
m, M adj. The lower-case “m” is the internationally
agreed abbreviation for the prefix “milli” (as in
millimetre, meaning 1/1000th of one metre). The upper-
case “M” is the international abbreviation for “Mega”,
meaning 1000000. Confusingly, in the computer indus-
try, the “M” is also used to mean 1048576 (1K times
1K.)
See k, K.
When used in the form MByte it

machine check
microcode
almost always means the latter, but in other contexts its
meaning is usually chosen to benefit the writer.
machine check n. A failure in the basic hardware of a
computer.
Automatic recovery is usually, but not
always, possible.
Also known, more loosely, as a
check.
machine code n. The lowest level of instructions
formally defined as being understood and acted upon by
a computer.
There may be lower-level instructions
(microcode) understood by a particular computer imple-
mentation, but machine code is the level that will be
common across a series of machines, such as the
System/370 line. See also code.
macro n. A template (with parts that can be included or
skipped by programming) that produces text by plugging
the macro’s arguments into slots in fixed text.
The
resulting text is then either considered as programming
language instructions (in assemblers or compilers), final
output text (as in text formatters), or as commands
(system, editor, or program macros).
In IBM it was,
until 1979, fashionable to write macros in outlandish
and preferably unreadable languages, usually abounding
with characters that are awkward to type on standard
keyboards.
This makes it appear very skilful to write
macros, when in fact the main attributes required are
those of good humour and considerable patience. See
also &.
. magic, FM n. A comment on a problem that solves
.
itself.
As in: “Things were crashing all over the place
.
earlier, but hey, FM, everything cleared up.” [The “F”
.
modifier here cannot be found in certain “unabridged”
.
dictionaries; it can, however, be located in any good
.
English dictionary, between Frustration and Fulfilment.]
mainframe n. A large computer, usually shared between
many users.
Originally referred to the central process-
ing unit of a large computer, which occupied the largest
or central frame (rack).
Now used to describe any
computer that is larger than a minicomputer.
Mainframe City n. Poughkeepsie, New York.
Where
most of IBM’s large computers (mainframes) are
designed.
manager 1. n. Within IBM, strictly defined to mean an
individual who has other employees directly responsible
to him or her.
Thus: “Ms Smith is the Manager of Mr
Jones”. 2. n. A title sometimes given to a person who
needs to sound important (to himself, herself, or others)
but who is not important enough to have anybody work-
ing for him or her. Thus: “Mr Fortescue-Smythe is the
Manager 
of 
Corporate 
Tiddlywink 
Sponsorship
Programmes”.
manager without portfolio n. An employed but unem-
ployed manager.
The term follows from the “Minister
Without Portfolio” in the British Cabinet.
man-month n. An arbitrary unit of work (see Brooks,
The Mythical Man-Month). Equivalent to the amount of
work that an “average” programmer could do in one
calendar month.
May or may not take into consider-
ation time spent in meetings, technical exchanges, vaca-
tion, holidays, illness, travelling, paperwork and design
flaws.
It is of course assumed that if one person could
complete a program in nine months, then by putting
another eight people on the job it will be completed in
one.
Now often called person-month.
For large
projects, the units “Person-Year” and “Person-Century”
can find favour.
march along the path v. To take the official view of
an issue (even though not entirely agreeing with it) in
order to show unity or loyalty to a particular point or
strategy.
mark of Kloomok n. Official indication that a product
has been released from PID. After one M. Kloomok, the
signatory to Shipping letters for many years.
(The
letters are no longer signed.)
In one customer memo-
randum, a person who was trying to emphasise the legit-
imacy of a product he was referring to stated that it bore
“the mark of Kloomok”.
. master n. The (or a) primary copy of a conferencing
.
facility (q.v.) disk that has one or more duplicates (shad-
.
ows) at remote locations. “You can get the full version
.
from the master.” See also catcher, pitcher.
. math-out n. A piece of work so full of mathematics that
.
the reader cannot see anything meaningful anywhere.
.
(By analogy with “white-out”.)
Maytag mode n. The behaviour exhibited by an 8809
tape drive in streaming mode, when attached to an inad-
equate or distracted CPU.
The continuously back-
tracking horizontal reels uncannily resemble washing
machine agitators; the 8809’s “top-loading” configura-
tion just strengthens the analogy.
The term sees
common but clandestine usage in some Customer
Support Centers.
[“Maytag” is the brand name of a
washing machine (and other white goods) produced in
the USA and known for their reliability.]
Meg n. Megabyte. As in: “This program needs two Meg
to run”. “Meg” does not usually have a different plural
form. See m, M.
message war n. The long and monotonous conversa-
tion between two service machines (q.v.) resulting from
an implicit assumption by both that the other is a human
(and thus in need of guidance).
The messages can
usually be translated into English as “I did not under-
stand what you said”, repeated ad nauseam by both
sides.
If the message is short and the response time
between the two machines is also short, the conversation
can rapidly overload the network or the processors
involved.
MFR n. Memorandum For the Record.
A generally
secret broadside against some other party, which
rationalises one’s own position for posterity in local
files.
Where heavily used, the accumulated collection
forms a remarkable work of fiction. MFRs are favoured
CYA items since there is no possibility of refutation.
. mickey n. One unit of displacement for a mouse. Used
.
in the industry for some time, but made “official” in
.
OS/2, 
where 
a 
system 
call 
is 
named
.
“MouGetNumMickeys”.
[Perhaps one day the “disney”
.
will become a unit of measurement for animated graph-
.
ics?]
Mickey Mouse 1. adj. Of a program: expected to be
small, easy to write and usually of only temporary
importance. For example, a program to fix an error in a
data file caused by a bug in another program. Naturally,
Mickey Mouse programs tend to last longer, get bigger,
and in their turn do more damage than the official
programs written in the first place, thus turning into
King Kong programs. Use of this term is inadvisable in
the Emerald Isle [Ireland]. See also toy. 2. adj. Unnec-
essary.
Used when complaining about bureaucratic
harassment, as in: “not another Mickey Mouse form to
fill in!”
microcode n. Any software the customer cannot get his
hands on.
Originally used to refer to the instructions
(embedded in the hardware) that are at a lower level
than the machine architecture instructions.
With the
advent of RISC technology, and the increasing number
of products shipped OCO (q.v.), the distinction between
microcode and other code – already hazy – has almost
completely gone.

micro iron
move
micro iron n. Any 370 architecture machine hiding
under the covers of a personal computer. This term has
arisen mainly due to the announcement (on 18th October
1983) of the XT/370 – a System/370 processor plugged
into an IBM PC-XT – followed in 1984 by the
announcement of the AT/370. See also pig iron.
mid-air adj. Unsound. Used to describe a technological-
ly or financially shaky project, as in: “That’s a mid-air
project”.
This is a reference to the phrase “feet firmly
planted in mid-air” (rather than on the ground).
migration n. A movement from one level of a product
to a newer level, or to an alternative strategic product.
Migration is often needed, even if the currently installed
products are viewed as being completely satisfactory, so
that continued support will be possible.
Subtle “incen-
tives” such as “If you do not migrate we will be unable
to support your installation” can be applied to prod a
|
customer or internal user into making the change. Hard-
|
ware migration comes in three flavours: “horizontal”,
|
where one changes to a model of the same size in the
|
new range of machines (for instance, from 3090-200E to
|
3090-200S), “vertical”, where the change is for a bigger
|
model in the same range (3090-200E to 3090-400E),
|
and “diagonal”, where the change is for a bigger model
|
in the new range (3090-200E to 3090-400S).
. milk a mouse v. To pursue an issue which is trivial,
.
inconsequential, or uninteresting.
Most often used in a
.
meeting where a much larger and more important issue
.
is to be discussed.
minicomputer
n. Any 
machine 
with 
a
non-370-compatible architecture that runs under 3 MIPS.
Also mini.
[This definition is rapidly evolving, due to
the announcement of the 9370 office System/370
machines in October 1986.] See also vector processor.
. minidisk n. A portion of a (real, physical) disk that is
.
available to a virtual machine and which appears to be a
.
real disk device. A virtual disk.
Minnow n. A floppy disk used for the initial loading of
some System/370 computers. See IPL.
MIP-burner n. A long-running program.
A derogatory
term used to describe any piece of software that takes,
or appears to take, more time to accomplish something
than the end result would seem to justify. Also used to
describe any piece of software that responds slowly to
requests.
MIP-eater n. Any program that uses more than 10% of a
shared CPU on behalf of a single user. Corrupt usage –
it should of course be “MIPS-eater” (see MIPS).
MIP envy n. The term, coined by Jim Gray in 1980, that
began the Tandem Memos (q.v.).
MIP envy is the
coveting of other’s facilities – not just the CPU power
available to them, but also the languages, editors,
debuggers, mail systems and networks.
MIP envy is a
term every programmer will understand, being another
expression of the proverb “The grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence”.
MIPS (mipps) 1. n. Millions of Instructions Per Second,
a measure of processor speed.
Though often used, the
term “1 MIP” is incorrect.
(“One Million Instructions
Per...”
What?
Year?) 2. n. Misleading Indication of
Processor Speed. See also cycles, throughput.
mission n. A strange word used by IBM powercrats to
imply “job”, “function”, “strategy”, or “responsibility”.
Thus: “It is this division’s Mission to produce low-cost
widgets”. Fighting over the ownership of Missions is a
favourite (and in some cases the only) activity of many
Senior Executives.
“Mission” has the advantage over
more mundane descriptive words of implying a certain
level of spiritual righteousness about the share-out of the
spoils of the fight, and is therefore usually spelt with a
capital “M”.
mixed case adj. Of commentary, system messages, etc.:
not all in upper case, and therefore easy to read and
understand. Usage (prior to REXX, 1979): rare.
mocha adj. Enhanced flavour, i.e., a modified and
improved version of a program.
Approximately equiv-
alent to chocolate, though some rate it more highly.
Sometimes used in the phrase mocha almond fudge,
as in early ISIL documentation. See also vanilla, flavour.
model n. A suffix to the four digit product number, used
to distinguish different varieties of the same product.
The suffix can be numeric, alphabetic, or a combination
of both.
There is usually no connection between the
suffix ordering and the size and performance of the unit.
For example, in order of performance, the 3083 comput-
er has models E, B, and J (in this particular case, the
letters are rumoured to be the initials of the project
manager).
. Model A n. An A-Box (q.v.).
This term is sometimes
.
used for the person most trusted by a project manager
.
[right-hand person?].
modulate v. To change.
“Let’s modulate our approach
to this problem.”
From the radio engineer’s term for
sending out a message by modulating a carrier wave.
module n. A general purpose noun that can mean almost
anything. Some current favourites: a section of code; a
package of circuitry containing one or more chips; a unit
of instruction; or a temporary building.
Moletown
n. The Yorktown Heights location (the
T. J. Watson Research Center).
A reference to the
observation that none of the offices or laboratories there
have windows. The disease spread to Poughkeepsie and
was there incorporated in the 1982 Office Design Stand-
ard. See also outside awareness.
. Mongolian Hordes Technique n. A software develop-
.
ment method whereby large numbers of inexperienced
.
programmers are thrown at a mammoth software project
.
(instead of deploying a small team of skilled program-
|
mers). First recorded in 1965, but popular as ever in the
|
1990s.
motherhood 1. n. Condescension.
Used to describe a
common attitude of software development groups toward
their underlings (i.e., the users of their software).
It is
attributable to the observation that designers often
believe their creations to be the “ultimate solution”, to
which no possible improvement could be conceived.
“Why 
don’t 
they 
distribute 
source 
code?” 
–
|
“Motherhood, pure motherhood”. 2. n. Something that
|
is good and true (cf. fatherhood) and should not raise
|
any objections.
For example: “I’ll start the pitch on
testing our software with some motherhood about why
testing is good”.
move n. A relocation (movement) of an IBMer from one
office to another, either to a new building or (more
often) to somewhere in the same building. As in: “Has
the move been delayed again?”
A move takes a mini-
mum of two days of an employee’s time: half a day to
pack up all the accumulated material (junk) from desks
and cabinets into fold-up cardboard or plastic boxes; a
quarter-day to cut out little squares and rectangles and
tape them into a model office so the movers know
where to put the furniture when it is moved; half a day,
once the furniture has been physically moved from one
office to the other, to move it around to where it is actu-
ally wanted (rather than to where you said you wanted it
or where the movers left it); three-quarters of a day to
unpack the boxes back into the furniture – taking care to
re-read all those gems that only get read after an office
move.

movers and shakers
new news
movers and shakers n. Those people who wear the
power suits (q.v.).
Usually (but not always) the people
whose ambition is only surpassed by their egos.
MSG (message)
v. To communicate via a computer-
transmitted message, rather than by telephone.
Usage:
“MSG me when you are ready to go to lunch”.
MSSB n. Multiple Suppliers Systems Bulletin. A memo
used as a scare tactic on customers rash enough to try
using a non-IBM component in an IBM system or
network.
It is said that once one was issued to a UK
customer who tried (and failed) to link an IBM
mainframe host to an IBM office device using IBM
modems.
The story goes that the IBM response to the
problem was that the 20 metres of wire linking the two
modems was not IBM provided.
. Mud Flats n. The Myers Corner Laboratory, near
.
Poughkeepsie.
From the geography of the land on
.
which it was built. See also Orchard.
multiplex v. To switch one’s focus between several
tasks that are competing for attention.
This lets one
demonstrate the uncanny human ability to totally
mismanage a multitude of tasks simultaneously.
multiwrite n. Multiple write authorisation for a disk.
An especially powerful way of accessing data on VM
disks, usually outlawed.
Since it allows more than one
user to arbitrarily write on a disk, possibly without any
cooperation or heed for the other users, it invariably
results in mislaid, destroyed, or subtly corrupted data
files.
. musical systems n. A popular game played at some
.
sites where people have userids on many test [and,
.
sometimes, production] systems.
The rules are simple:
.
one moves from system to system until one finds a
.
system which stays up long enough to complete the
.
logon procedure.
| MVM n. Multiple Virtual Memory.
The original name
|
for MVS (q.v.), which fell foul of the fashion of chang-
|
ing “memory” to “storage”.
MVS 1. n. Multiple Virtual Storage, an alternate name
for OS/VS2 (Release 2), and hence a direct descendent
|
of OS. [OS/VS2 (Release 1) was in fact the last release
|
of OS MVT, to which paging had been added; it was
|
known by some as SVS (Single Virtual Storage).] MVS
is one of the “big two” operating systems for
System/370 computers (the other being VM (q.v.)).
2. n. Man Versus System.
naive adj. Having never used a particular system or
program before. This does not have anything to do with
the general experience or maturity of the person.
“Ah,
but can a naive user use it?” See also end user.
naive user 1. n. Someone new to the computer game.
Usually viewed with a mixture of sympathy and pity.
2. n. A person who cannot chew gum and walk at the
same time.
(When applied to someone not-so-new to
the game.)
Nasty and Cold Division
n. The North-Central
Marketing Division.
(Alternative expansion of the
abbreviation.) See also Sunny and Warm Division.
nastygram n. An (unwelcome) error message.
This
term is used for cryptic and “telegraphic style” error
messages, especially when prefixed by an identification
sequence that distracts the eye.
There is no such thing
as a “Friendlygram”.
Nathan Hale n. An asterisk (“*”).
Reportedly from
Nathan Hale’s remarks before being hanged: “I regret
that I have but one asterisk for my country”.
Usage
prevalent only among those with a Neu Yawk or Noo
Joisey accent, for various and obvious reasons. [Nathan
Hale was a (failed) spy involved in the American War
of Independence.]
National Language Support
n. Support for any
language other than American English.
The phrase
National Language Enabled is loosely used to
describe any program for which more than a few
seconds of thought have been spent in considering the
problems of making it work successfully in environ-
ments other than the USA. See also Domestic, nonus.
needs of the business n. An undefined reason for not
letting you have something.
“No, you can’t have five
more headcount, because of the needs of the business.”
need to know n. A reason supplied to justify access to
restricted information.
This phrase is most often
wielded when someone wishes to avoid passing on a
piece of information, usually because the information
would be embarrassing.
“Do you have a need to
know?”
net v. To send by computer network (rather than by tape
or by post). “I’ll net you the files tomorrow.” See also
VNET, snail mail.
| netiquette n. The “good manners” preferred when inter-
|
acting with other people on a computer network.
|
Netiquette deals with many things, such as the length of
|
distribution lists in PROFS notes, the size of the files
|
sent over the network, the habit of attaching a copy of
|
every note to its reply, the ability to spell, etc.
net it out v. To precis. A term used (mostly by manag-
ers) to denote a strong desire to bypass understanding of
a 
proposed 
solution 
in 
favour 
of 
a 
simplistic
quantification of it – as in: “I don’t want to understand
all the reasoning behind it, just net it out for me”.
Higher level managers may interchange use of this term
with bottom line (q.v.). See also crisp up.
netlag 1. n. The time it takes files to travel from one
point to another on an electronic network.
2. n. The
result of one’s internal (biological) clock being out of
synchronisation with local time due to working on an
electronic network.
For example, there is a tendency
among European IBMers to live on the USA clock in
order to have a maximum working time overlap with
their US colleagues.
This means that they constantly
look as though they just stepped off an overnight flight.
3. n. The discrepancy in file timestamps between the
sender’s 
copy 
and 
the 
recipient’s 
copy.
See
GMT-friendly. Due to bugs in transmission software or to
systems having trouble adjusting to Summer (Daylight
Savings) Time. (There are four changes a year between
Europe and North America.)
net-net v. To summarise a presentation into less than
twenty words.
An interjection used by impolite execu-
tives to stop a meandering presentation and find out
what resources the speaker is really asking for.
. netrash (net-trash)
n. Any file with useless contents,
.
sent over a network.
The electronic equivalent of junk
.
mail. Some service machines are very good at generat-
.
ing netrash, especially those which try to “intelligently”
.
process files aimed at non-existent userids.
Service
.
machines have a considerable advantage here, but, alas,
.
humans have been reported to outperform them in a
.
number of cases.
| netrock n. A strident complaint sent over an electronic
|
network. As in: “You should see the netrocks I’m field-
|
ing!”
new news n. Something that was left out of the last
plan and which is therefore suitable for presentation to
management because they will not have heard of it yet.
This is distinguished from old news, something that
even management knows about.

Nice To Have
null
Nice To Have n. A good idea, but not absolutely neces-
sary.
Usage: “That enhancement seems to me to be a
Nice To Have, but how does it bring extra revenue?”
See also business case.
NIH (en-eye-aich)
adj. “Not Invented Here” or “Not
In-House”.
A hatred of anything new, sometimes
almost classifiable as misoneism.
Possibly more
common inside IBM than outside, though of course
IBM’s house is larger than most.
Also NITT (nit) Not
Invented in This Tower. See also nonus.
| nit n. A task, such as improving the user interface to a
|
program, that has not yet been done and should be trivial
|
to do. As in: “That’s just a nit – I’ll fix it in that spare
|
week before we ship”.
| no-brainer n. An exercise or test which ought to be
|
easy for the student but in practice tends to generate
|
results which indicate that the student has no brain rath-
|
er than that the test requires no brain.
| nocon v. To avoid contact.
From the abbreviation for
|
“no contact” used by support groups (especially those
|
dealing mostly with telephone enquiries).
“He keeps
|
noconning me” implies that the other party is deliberate-
|
ly avoiding your call.
noddy program n. A simple program to perform some
basic function missing from a larger program.
“I have
written a Noddy program to display the time the system
was IPLed.”
Named from the simple-minded hero of a
popular series of books for very young children (now
banned in many educational establishments, having been
accused of promoting racism and other undesirable prac-
tices).
Unlike properly designed and tested programs,
Noddy programs always work correctly.
(Sometimes
also known as “back of an envelope” programs, from
the original source document.
They used to be written
on the back of punch cards until these were made obso-
lete by virtual cards.)
nodeid (node-eye-dee)
n. The nickname under which a
computer is known to the rest of a network.
As for a
userid (q.v.), tradition and ancient lore dictates that a
nodeid should be made as cryptic, non-mnemonic and
difficult to type as possible, although some havens of
sanity still survive (BOSTON, PALOALTO, PARIS).
VENTA has the unique privilege of being mnemonic to
Latin native speakers.
[VENTA derives from Venta
Belgarum, “Town of the Belgae”, the Roman name for
Winchester, England.] See also vnetid.
non-concur v. To formally state that one will not
support the action (such as a product announcement) of
another group.
The ultimate threat.
Makes any project
management quake – grown men have been seen to cry
when threatened with this.
This is an indication from
one group to another that the first is convinced that the
second is about to cause a major disaster, and that there-
fore the first group is prepared to escalate the matter as
high as necessary to resolve the problem. See concern,
issue,and the subtle variation De-Concur.
. Non-D (non-dee)
n. Non-Disclosure agreement.
A
.
document, often a “letter 112”, which an IBMer or
.
customer signs to acknowledge the receipt of proprietary
.
information and to promise not to pass on the informa-
.
tion to anyone else unless they too have signed an
.
appropriate Non-D.
to go nonlinear 1. v. To escalate a decision or concern
to a higher level of management without going though
every intermediate level of management.
That is, not
following the normal line (chain) of management.
Derived from the engineering graphical representation of
equations or processes that suddenly “blow up”.
See
.
also line management, food chain. 2. v. To have an
.
excessive, almost certainly emotional, response to a situ-
.
ation or stimulus; to show the symptoms of displace-
.
ment. “I tried to talk to him about that bug in his code
.
but he went nonlinear.”
non-strategic
adj. Embarrassingly superior to that
which is strategic.
It is permissible to attribute defects
to a non-strategic project even when nothing is known
about it.
In GBG (General Business Group) it used to
be automatically non-strategic to have a Big
Blue
solution to Office Systems needs.
nonus (non-you-ess)
adj. Outside Domestic, especially
when there is a difference from the way things are done
in the USA. “That’s a nonus issue – not my problem.”
This includes character sets, keyboard standards,
national languages, policies, politics, etc. Although often
pronounced “no-news”, it is rarely equivalent to “good
news”. See also National Language Support.
noodle v. To think or ponder.
Often used to hint that
there is no politically comfortable solution, and a crea-
tive approach or a joke is appropriate. “Noodle on this
overnight?”
Probably a back-formation from the
colloquial noun meaning “head” (originally a blockhead
or simpleton).
no-op, NOP (no-op)  1. n. No-operation.
An instruc-
tion to do nothing (used to fill up space or time during
execution of a program). Often used to allow space for
later insertion of a break point or hook. 2. n. Something
or someone ineffective. Usage: “He’s the biggest no-op
I have ever seen”. 3. v. To make ineffective.
As in:
“I’ll no-op that piece of code”, or “I’ll no-op that
group’s objection”.
no problem found
n. A colloquialism used by
Software/Hardware maintenance people to indicate that
they were unable to reproduce the users’ problem.
Depending on the tone of voice used, a gentle or not-so-
gentle way of asking for more information.
Also no
trouble found.
. NOSS, nossage 1. n. A message sent using the UK
.
NOSS network. NOSS is the IBM UK National Office
.
Support Service, which is based on VM systems running
.
PROFS (q.v.).
“I’ll be out of the office tomorrow, can
.
you send me a NOSS on it?” 2. v. To send such a
.
message. “I’ll NOSS you on that later.”
not obvious adj. A publication editor’s benign but ill-
informed re-wording of transparent.
The classic usage
was: “The operation of the cache is not obvious [rather
than transparent] to the programmer”.
This kind of
rewording tends to cause major riots in the programming
halls.
| notwork n. VNET (q.v.), when failing to deliver. Heavi-
|
ly used in 1988, when VNET was converted from the
|
old but trusty RSCS software to the new strategic
|
solution.
[To be fair, this did result in a sleeker, faster
|
VNET in the end, but at a considerable cost in material
|
and in human terms.] See also nyetwork, slugnet.
| nucleus n. The inner part of an operating system; that
|
part (usually) which is immediately accessible.
As the
|
atomic age matures, the term kernel is becoming more
|
popular.
NUCON (new-con)
adj. Originally a CMS term for the
NUcleus CONstant area, a static area in System/370
addressing page zero.
Now also used to describe a
programmer who will not (or cannot) write re-entrant
code: “He has NUCON mentality”. See nucleus.
null 1. n. A pointer (storage address) that does not point
to a real piece of storage.
Often used to mark the end
of a linked list of pieces of storage.
The null pointer
has different values (such as zero or -16777216) depend-
ing on the application or language. 2. n. A character (of
value zero) that looks like a blank but is not a “real”
blank.
A blank is real data, originally entered by a
person, that has value and should be preserved; nulls are

nums 
organic debugging
used to fill up areas on a mono-spaced screen that
contain no real data.
nums n. Short
for
“Numbers”.
Salesmen,
branch
managers, region managers and sometimes even division
presidents consider nums their end that justifies any
means.
Represents the quotas arbitrarily derived at the
beginning of a year to motivate the aforementioned
people.
To “make the nums” is to make quota or (if
spoken enthusiastically with gestures of the face –
wriggles of the mouth and the eyebrows) to surpass it.
It may display the speaker’s envy.
nybble n. A group of 4 binary digits (Bits) which make
up a single hexadecimal digit.
Four bits is half a byte
(q.v.), so “nybble” seems an appropriate term for this
unit. Also sometimes spelled nibble.
| nyetwork n. A variation of notwork (q.v.).
. obsolete v. To make obsolete. Commonly found in the
.
text of edition notices in books, as in:
“This major
.
revision obsoletes GHXX-XXXX”.
OCO (oh-see-oh, occo)
adj. Object Code Only.
A
product that is OCO is shipped with only the Object
Code (the text files produced by compilers).
The
original source code (often in IBM’s internal systems
programming language, PL/AS) is not provided. This is
partly because no PL/AS compiler is available as a
product – as any IBMer who has to write code for
customers is painfully aware.
Customers with an MVS background (who have never
had source code) see this as “business as usual”.
Customers who use VM see this as a totally unaccepta-
ble way to do business.
“We want to fix it in the
language it broke in”.
. October Revolution n. The 1986 reorganisation of
.
IBM France.
OEM (oh-ee-em)
n. Original Equipment Manufacturer, a
manufacturer who makes a fundamental sub-assembly
that others use to build a more complex product. Inside
IBM it means “Other Equipment Manufacturer”.
See
vendor.
OEMI (oh-emmy, or oh-ee-em-eye)  adj. This is used to
precisely identify the System/370 channel to control unit
interface (also still known by the name FIPS60 – a
standard which is at least 10 years out of date).
The
word is derived from the channel to control unit inter-
face OEMI Manual (GA22-6974), in which OEMI
means 
“Original 
Equipment 
Manufacturer’s
Information”.
(The “I” in OEMI is often misconstrued
to mean “interface”; however, “interface” is defined by
the United States Supreme Court to mean a physical
place where Other Equipment Manufacturers are legally
entitled to attach their “Plug Compatible Units”. Fortu-
nately for 95% of the world’s population, this particular
ruling is limited by jurisdiction.)
offering n. A product release. As in: “The next offering
will have that feature”.
| offline
1. adj. Not
online
(q.v.).
2. adv. Later,
in
private.
From the state (not on-line) of a piece of
computer equipment not connected directly to the
processor for one reason or another. As in: “Let’s take
that offline”.
Used by speakers when a question has
been asked and a) the speaker does not know the
answer; or b) the speaker has a detailed answer which is
probably not of interest to most of the audience; or c)
the speaker does know the answer, and it is of interest,
but does not want to give it in public.
| offsite meeting n. A meeting not held at an IBM site
|
(location). Meetings are held offsite either for pragmat-
|
ic reasons or for effect.
old iron n. Obsolete IBM equipment, as seen by market-
ing. In customers’ shops, it is barely obsolescent; with-
in 
IBM 
internal 
functions 
(except 
marketing
demonstration centres) it hasn’t even been installed yet.
This was applied particularly to the 3277 Visual Display
Unit (single-colour, but still unsurpassed for speed of
alphanumeric display – but not information transfer – to
the user); in IBM UK it used to be traditional to have a
mixture of these with English and American keyboards,
usually connected to the wrong display control units.
But today 3277s are truly old iron. See also iron.
one-line fix n. A change to a program that is so small it
requires no documentation before it crashes the system.
Usually “cured” by another One-Line Fix.
See also I
didn’t change anything.
| online adj. Of some peripheral device (printer, tape
|
drive, etc.): connected to, attached to, or controlled by a
|
computer (usually a mainframe). See also offline, vary.
Opel letter n. A Speak Up! sent to the highest levels of
the Corporation.
Sometimes seen as opal letter.
As
in: “If he tries to pull that on me, I swear I’ll write an
Opel letter about it”.
[The term does convey a vague
luminescence, no?]
This term may or may not be
replaced by the phrase “Akers letter”.
| open door v. To skip one or more levels of manage-
|
ment, usually to force the resolution of some grievance.
|
From the “Open Door” programme that allows any
|
employee to escalate a grievance, even up to the Chief
|
Executive Officer if necessary.
Usage: “I’ll open door
|
him if he blocks my move again”. See also Speak Up!.
to go open kimono 1. v. To reveal everything to
someone. Once you have gone open kimono, you have
nothing more to hide.
(This is the more common
sense.) 2. v. To give someone a tantalising glimpse of a
project (i.e., enough to get him interested but not
enough to give any secrets away).
[This is an interest-
ing example of the same jargon having two rather differ-
ent meanings.
This may, and does, cause amusing
misunderstandings at times.]
open switch n. An unresolved issue. Usage: “Whether
we do that or not is still an open switch”.
opportunity 1. n. A menial task that your manager
wants you to do, or a difficult or undesirable assign-
ment.
As in: “I have an opportunity for you”.
Often
used in the phrase opportunity to excel. 2. n. Prob-
lem.
“This company doesn’t have Problems, it has
Opportunities.”
An opportunity can be a little more
positive or optimistic than a simple problem, or if espe-
cially large and intractable may be described as an
insurmountable opportunity See also challenge.
. orange box v. An IBM telephone switching system,
.
developed by the ROLM Division of the corporation
.
(sold to Siemens in 1989).
From the ROLM CBX II,
.
8000 or 9000.
The switching system in production
.
before the October 1987 announcement of the IBM 9750
.
(which is cream white). See also ROLMan.
Orchard n. The Armonk location. Corporate Headquar-
ters was built on the site of an apple orchard (hence the
address: Old Orchard Road, Armonk, NY 10504).
Some fruit trees still remain, but it is understood that
they have been chemically treated to produce flowers
but no fruit. This condition is perhaps known as appel-
lation controlee.
organic 
debugging
n. A 
euphemism 
for 
some
fashionable techniques for “improving” the Quality of
software.
Reportedly, the output from a compilation or
assembly of the suspect program is placed on the floor,
with a large flat dish on top of it, and an indoor plant in
a pot is placed in the centre of the dish.
The dish is
then filled with water. The principle is that any bugs in
the program will be attracted towards the house plant

parity bit
and drown as they try to cross the intervening water.
From statistical evidence this seems about as effective a
technique as many others currently in use.
It is
hypothesised that the technique would be even more
effective if the house plant were first marinated in
Kirsch (branntwein), but of course it has been impossi-
ble to test this on IBM Domestic (USA) premises.
OS (oh-ess, oss)
n. Any of the operating systems
MVS/XA, MVS, SVS, MFT, MVT, or VS1.
These
operating systems all grew from “OS/360”, the first
widespread 360 Operating System.
The term OS
excludes such operating systems as CP/67, VM/370,
VM/SP, VM/XA, TSS, RASP, and ACP. See also Big
OS.
out-plan adj. Of a task: desirable but planned not to be
done.
In general: Whatever it is that you want to be
in-plan.
| outredalle (ootreuh-dahl)
n. For EMEA HQ people,
|
the IBM France headquarters; for IBM France HQ
|
people, the EMEA headquarters. The wide plaza at the
|
centre of the Defense district in Paris is known as “la
|
dalle” (a dalle is a flat stone used in floors, or, in
|
modern architecture, any flat and horizontal piece of
|
concrete of sufficient dimensions).
The EMEA HQ in
|
Tour Pascal and the IBM France HQ in Tour Descartes
|
are located on opposite sides of the plaza, and therefore
|
anybody going from one tower to the other goes across
|
(outre-) the “dalle”.
outside awareness n. A window.
Some IBM offices
and (especially) laboratories are totally lacking in
windows, but at last someone has noticed that people
work better if they can see the rest of the world, so new
offices are now sometimes specified to have outside
awareness.
This radical concept (that programmers
require at least 3 hours of direct sunlight every day or
their hexadecimals cease to function) is not universal.
In Poughkeepsie and Yorktown, engineers are not
allowed to see the light.
As a reflection of this, a
number of signs (with a variety of creative artwork)
have appeared on the walls.
They usually state some
variation on the theme: “I must be a mushroom, because
they keep me in the dark, and feed me lots of horse
manure”. [Of all the world, only IBM employees know
less about IBM than journalists.] See Moletown.
overflow n. A connection that could not be made auto-
matically.
A printed-circuit card has a limited capacity
for connection, determined by the number of channels
for wires between connection points and by the number
of vias available. For a complex card, it is not possible
to 
embed 
all 
the 
desired 
connections.
Those
connections that could not be included in the printed
wiring are called overflows, and are connected manually
using yellow wires.
. Overhead Row n. The most plush office corridor in a
.
location.
This houses the head person (and entourage),
.
whose true power (or ambition) may be gauged by
.
assessing the quality of the wood furniture, the depth of
.
the carpet, and the rarity of the potted plants.
Owego (oh-wee-go)  See branch to Owego.
. own 1. v. To have responsibility for, and some degree
.
of control over, a product, project, or data.
See owner.
.
2. v. To have responsibility for, but almost no control
.
over, the security of a data processing entity, such as
.
one’s personal userid.
. owner n. The person (usually a manager, and by exten-
.
sion his or her department), who is responsible for the
.
development or maintenance of a product. Formally, the
.
owner is always a manager; in practice, ownership and
.
some responsibility are delegated to whoever is actually
.
doing the work.
Documentation is unusual in that it
.
often has two owners, the book owner and the technical
.
owner (who owns the product being documented).
. pack rat n. A person who keeps immense numbers of
.
ancient programs around [presumably on a disk, rather
.
than in a den] just in case they may prove useful.
| padded cell n. A program that limits its user to a finite,
|
and usually small, subset of the capabilities of the
|
computer on which it runs. This is intended to save the
|
user from injury (to person or to pride), or to save the
|
computer or data from damage by the user.
Also
|
padded cell environment.
paged out adj. Not paying attention, distracted. “What
did you say?
I’m sorry – I was paged out.”
Refers to
the state of a task in a multi-tasking system whose stor-
age chunks (pages) have been moved out of the comput-
er onto some other kind of storage, such as disks.
The
program is just not all there.
. page printer n. A printer that prints a whole page at a
.
time, 
with 
the 
ability 
to 
represent 
printers’
.
proportionally-spaced fonts and (usually) illustrations.
.
The IBM version of “APA (all-points-addressable) print-
.
er”. Note that printers that use datastreams not invented
.
by IBM are not Page Printers.
. Pagoda n. The IBM Centre in Sydney, Australia.
.
Named after the shape of the awnings adorning the
.
building.
. pain in the net n. A person whose primary activity
.
seems to be bothering others by sending them netrash,
.
either directly or via a service machine.
. Panda- n. A generic name for an object, usually in the
.
form of a prefix.
Usage: “That could conflict with
.
PandaCalc”.
First used generically in the construction
.
“Pandamuffins”. See also Finnoga-, Fred.
| panoota
1. v. To
guess
or
estimate.
From
IBM
|
Australia; the abbreviation of Pull A Number Out Of
|
The Air.
As in: “Let me panoota a figure for you.”
|
2. adj. Estimated or guessed. “It’s a panoota number.”
paper chase n. An officially sanctioned version of the
infamous chain letter. (Also paper game.) For exam-
ple, person A sends a letter to person B, copying
persons C and D. Persons B, C as well as D may reply,
copying each other and incidentally persons E, F, G, H
and I. Person A, in self-defence, responds to all, this
time via a distribution list including persons B through I
and anyone else he can think of who might be remotely
interested. The next step is usually a meeting, to which
the persons on the distribution list each invite one or
more members of their respective departments.
The process usually runs down when the list of play-
ers gets so large that the secretary or program attempt-
ing to book the meetings that follow cannot find a
time-slot acceptable to all.
parallel adj. On a similar path, drawn using a jagged
edge, and only slightly divergent from some other path.
Usage: “The new documentation will be consistent with
and parallel to the existing documentation”.
See also
transparent.
paren 1. n. Short form of “parenthesis”.
Many people
have forgotten that “parenthesis” is the real word. CMS
users seldom bother to balance them; and many user-
written CMS programs report the presence of a closing
right parenthesis as an error. 2. n. The character “(”;
used in conversation to pair with thesis. For example,
the string “A(B)” might be described as “A paren B
thesis”.
Especially favoured by LISP programmers,
burdened by many such. See also banana.
parity bit n. An extra bit kept in parallel with each byte
of memory in the storage of most IBM computers (even
[nearly all] PCs). This parity bit states the parity of the
remaining eight bits, and so gives a high probability of

detecting an error in any given storage location.
Of
course, it also adds 12.5% more memory that may fail,
 and somehow it often does seem that only parity bit
memory chips fail.
parm (parm)
n. Misspelt abbreviation of the word
“Parameter”, a variable argument to a program. This is
used so universally that “param” sounds silly.
. partitioned adj. Separated, broken.
As in: “When the
.
transatlantic 
links 
are 
down, 
VNET 
becomes
.
partitioned”. Here, the distinction between “broken” and
.
“partitioned” varies depending on the time of day and
.
whether you are east or west of the partition.
[Fog in
.
Channel: Continent cut off.]
part number 1. n. The IBM catalogue number of a
spare or replacement part. 2. n. Where English is not
the native language, an item which has a part number in
an IBM catalogue.
You can be asked for or given a
“numero de part number” (part-number number).
This
sense applies only to non-native English speakers. First
heard from one of the Essonnes plant managers, but
since also from FEs and other people from various
European countries. See also product number, model
number.
passthrough n. Any of a variety of methods by which
one computer which is receiving messages from a termi-
nal passes them on to a second computer as though the
terminal were directly connected to it (and similarly
relays messages coming in the opposite direction). Also
spelt passthru, from the name of one such program.
Passthrough requires a program in the first computer to
pretend to be a terminal.
Having to write such a
program is very helpful in making computer buffs expe-
rience something of the effect of their work on real
people, but sadly the architects and planners who design
the data streams never have to dirty their hands and
write one.
|
By implication, passthrough is used from small
|
computers to larger ones, or between peers.
Hence
|
reverse passthrough is used when a large mainframe
|
computer is used to provide access to a much smaller
|
machine.
| patch 1. n. A fix applied to a program by adding new
|
machine
code in an otherwise empty area (often
|
provided specifically for this purpose).
Applying a
|
patch was often much quicker than rebuilding the
|
program from source. 2. v. To fix a program.
Often
|
implies a “quick and dirty” fix. See also zap.
path 1. n. The sequence of hops (q.v.) followed by a
file sent from one node to another.
The path may
appear very strange, at times, since it is chosen accord-
ing to prevalent link speeds and traffic, rather than on
purely geographical constraints. For instance, files have
been seen transferred from Kingston to Endicott (both in
New York State) via Santa Teresa (in California), and
there is one report of files going from Hursley to
Portsmouth (both in Hampshire) via Poughkeepsie (New
York). 2. n. The channel(s) used by a mainframe to
access its peripherals. 3. n. The order of search used by
an operating system to locate a program or piece of
data. See also dual path.
| pay for the coffee v. To suffer mild pressure. Said to
|
originate from an occasion when a manager, not known
|
for his intra-personal skills or generosity, bought one of
|
his employees a coffee.
The employee, surprised,
|
politely thanked the man and headed back to his desk,
|
only to find he had been followed and was now being
|
confronted with a work-related problem.
“Sure,” he
|
quipped, “now you’re going to make me pay for this
|
coffee...”. See also tanstaafl.
PC (pee-cee)
n. The IBM Personal Computer. In order
to discourage the persistent innovators who suggested
that IBM build yet another desktop computer, they were
told to bring it from conception to production in less
than a year. The result was one of the most visible (but
not the most profitable) successes since System/360.
The very unfortunate choice of processor hinders the
competition just as much as IBM, but even so the effect
of standardisation has been of considerable benefit to
those using the machine (or one of its many copies).
PDB n. Pastel Denim Binder.
One of the few pieces of
truly IBM jargon associated with the IBM Personal
Computer. Refers to the boxes and binders in which the
documentation for the PC is shipped.
May be almost
any colour.
. peach letter See blue letter.
peer review n. An approval process whereby a design
or product is reviewed by the technical peers of the
designer or design group. When treated responsibly this
is a powerful and effective technique, but all too often it
becomes a political skirmish.
In this latter case it
becomes a game with many players on one side and
usually few on the other. The object is for the side with
many players to inundate the opposing group (the
“peers”) with so many facts and figures about the good-
ness of the design being reviewed, that the second group
must just nod in agreement or run the risk of appearing
stupid.
When played successfully, the members of the
second group dare not ask for additional information for
fear of being told they had already seen it in presenta-
tion form.
pel n. Picture Element.
One addressable point on a
display screen or printed sheet of paper. This is used as
a convenient abbreviation (far more logical and easier to
say than “pixel”), and also as a measure of screen or
printer resolution, as in “16 pels per mm (16ppmm)”.
| penalty box 1. n. A position of low esteem. This term
|
probably derives from Ice Hockey, in which rule-
|
breakers may be required to sit out of the game (in an
|
area called the penalty box) for some specified period of
|
time.
Thus, when an executive is transferred from a
position of power to one of less power, perhaps after
having been associated with a failed project, this may be
described as “going to the penalty box”.
Favoured
penalty boxes are Research (see sandbox), Group Staff,
Quality Coordinator, or Branch Manager of a remote or
moribund location.
Another technique is to keep the
offender at the same location, but put him or her in
charge of a less exotic project (e.g., “Productivity” or
“Standards”).
Variation: “He got five years for
|
fighting”.
See also walk in the woods. 2. n. The OS/2
|
compatibility box (q.v.).
penguin n. An affectionate term for a member of a
Field Support team, when used by Laboratory personnel.
Field Support people in some areas wear white shirts,
dark suits, and a formal attitude. It’s also said that they
often walk with a side to side gait (waddle) caused by
carrying a tool kit in one hand and an oscilloscope in
the other in their Customer Engineer days.
. peon n. A person with no special privileges on a
.
computer system.
“I can’t force a new password for
.
you, I’m only a peon on this system.”
people n. Non-managers, as in: “Only first-line manag-
ers deal with people, in IBM”.
Higher-level managers,
it follows, do not deal with people.
(Who or what do
they deal with?)
perfect 
programmer 
syndrome
n. Arrogance.
“Since my program is right, there is no need to test it”.
Or:
“Yes, I can see there may be a problem here, but
I’ll never type SHUTDOWN on the RSCS console when

plan of record
there is a CP read up”.
[This latter action had the
unfortunate side-effect of closing down the entire
system, instead of just the communication subsystem
(RSCS) if the CP privilege class assigned was too high.]
performance release n. A release of a product or
internal program put together (usually in a hurry) when
it becomes apparent that the previous release was too
slow or used too much resource. A performance release
should show improvements in performance without loss
of function.
permanent home n. Any IBM building or office in
which you will reside for less than one year.
permanent move n. temporary assignment (q.v.).
permanent recording n. The only data that remains on
a disk after a head crash. Readable only by one or two
gurus in San Jose.
personal computer 1. n. Before 12 August 1981: a
computer used by one person, who is local to it and
does not time-share it. A catch-all for home computers,
hobby computers, the 5100 APL-based machine, profes-
sional workstations, some 3031s, and probably a few
Cray-1s. 2. n. After 12 August 1981: the IBM 5150,
5160, 6150, etc. This has had the predicted major
impact on the industry, and an even bigger impact on
IBM itself. 3. n. A way to continue business work at
home.
4. n. A way to continue game playing when at
work. See PC.
personalize v. To program.
As in: “Let’s personalize
the gate arrays tomorrow”. See burn sand.
person-month n. A fashionable term for man-month.
perturbate v. To perturb.
To cause an undesirable
change, usually in a budget or a schedule. Used chiefly
by Aerospace Engineer types who have joined IBM
some time into their careers.
“Joe, how much is this
going to perturbate your launch schedule?” [This is the
same strange modification to usual English as in the
constructions 
“orientate”, 
“preventative”, 
and
“indentate”.
I suppose that they do help sell storage
devices.] See also hit.
. PF4 v. To erase, or destroy.
This is derived from the
.
usual effect of pressing the hardwired “Program Function
.
key number 4” when running PROFS (q.v.).
As in:
.
“Yeah, I got that request and I PF4’d it!” Note that
.
PF4ing in PROFS only erases the working copy of a
.
document; it does not erase backup or other copies of
.
the document.
Phase 0 adj. Preliminary.
From “Phase 1 review”,
which is the first official review of a project. A “Phase
0 review” is a preliminary review, often conducted as a
trial run for the real Phase 1.
Hence, “do a Phase 0
estimate” means “do a preliminary estimate”.
| pick-and-pray n. A multi-choice question in an exercise
|
or test.
PID (pid)
adj. The version of a program as shipped to
customers.
From Program Information Department.
This department is no more, having been replaced by
ISD (IBM Software Distribution) and then SMD (Soft-
ware Manufacturing and Delivery) but the term PID is
still very widely used. “These days, we have to run the
PID version”. See vanilla.
. PID buffer n. A period of approximately three weeks
.
during which a software release matures while at PID
.
(q.v.).
This provides a convenient breathing space
.
during which the developers can discover problems
.
before the software is shipped.
pig
iron n. Any very large, very fast, mainframe
computer (equivalent in cost to a 5 MIPS mainframe in
1982). Used as: “Sure that software is slow, but it will
sell a lot of pig iron that way.” See also rusty iron, micro
iron, push iron.
. pistol n. A program whose protection features (if it has
.
any) make it very easy for you to shoot yourself in the
.
foot. Usage: “The DOS COPY command is such a nice
.
pistol!”
pitch 1. n. A presentation. “Are you going to the Akers
pitch in the auditorium?” 2. v. To present, or attempt to
persuade.
“Are you going to pitch that to staff some-
day?”
. pitcher n. A program that executes at a central site and
.
distributes [sends] programs and data to remote
.
locations.
The term comes from a North American
.
game called “baseball”. See catcher.
PITS (pitz)
v. To register a problem on the Problem
Information Tracking System.
PITS is an ad hoc data-
base system, developed at the Glendale Laboratory at
Endicott, that is used for tracking problems during soft-
ware development. “That looks like a real bug; you had
better PITS it.”
. PizzBoo n. The Publishing Systems Business Unit, one
.
of the first to BiCapitalize mainframe products.
From
.
the usual pronunciation of its abbreviation, PSBU.
placard a balais n. Broom cupboard. The empty space
in mainframes, often used by CEs to store all kinds of
tools and spare parts.
It is reported that in civilised
countries this space can advantageously be used for the
storage of beverages.
Sugary drinks, beer, Champagne,
and white wine go near the channel cable input to take
advantage of the cold air intake by the cable hole in the
floor.
Red wines can be warmed to an appropriate
temperature in the power supply area.
.
A Domestic reader recalls the control unit for the
.
2305 drum, whose early models had a built-in
.
compressor to cool them because the forced room-
.
temperature air was not sufficient.
This had a space
.
next to the cooling coils that was just big enough to
.
hold a six-pack [a retail unit of six cans of beer].
At
.
some military installations, where the rules on beer were
.
less strict than at civilian installations, the operations
.
staff were wont to share an IBM-cooled can or two with
.
visitors.
planar n. A large printed circuit card onto or into which
other cards are plugged. Known as a “Motherboard” by
users of cruder imagery.
| planification n. Planning [one must suppose].
As in:
|
“This software qualification tool allows the conception,
|
maintenance, planification and execution of sequence
|
tests.”
| planned personal illness n. A minor illness, serious
|
enough to require absence from work, which the victim
|
seems to know about several days in advance.
Mostly
|
taken by people who are rarely ill and who feel that
|
they are “entitled” to their fair share of time off.
planner n. One whose job is to think about doing real
work.
planners’ droop n. A chronic symptom demonstrated
by most forecast graphs.
It describes the tendency of
revenue projection graphs for a given product to show a
steep rise for the next 3 years followed by a steep
decline.
Since falling graphs are anathema to any self-
respecting planner, the situation is usually remedied by
postulating a gap product which will appear in 3 years
and keep the revenue graph going upwards.
This has
the added advantage that the product manager has a
superb excuse to explain his need for a further cast of
thousands to develop this (hypothetical) product.
plan of record n. Plan. A plan of record has by impli-
cation extra solidity – though in fact it is the least reli-
able plan of all, since product plans always change.
.
Caution dictates that any figures or targets in a plan of
.
record, once committed to paper, will not be sufficiently
.
“aggressive”.

inflates such figures before passing the plan up the
.
chain, until it reaches the final authority – who sets the
.
numbers or target according to some preconceived
.
notion. See also action plan, whim of record.
. plant life n. One who works in a manufacturing plant
.
(rather than in a sales or development area).
| platform n. A collection of machines, often of the same
|
hardware architecture, or a family of operating systems
|
or software interfaces.
Usage: “We’ll build the new
|
cellar management application on a PS/2 platform”, or
|
“The communications help facility will be based on an
|
AIX platform”.
play v. To spend one’s own time on a project.
As in:
“I’m staying this evening to play with the new Fred
program”.
It seems that most really usable software, a
surprising amount of revenue, and even more profit,
derives from such “play”.
play pen n. A room where programmers work.
plist (pee-list)
n. Parameter list. A programming mech-
anism for passing arguments (parameters) from one
environment or program to another.
point n. A measurement of the IBM list price of a prod-
uct, originally equivalent to a monthly rental of one U.S.
dollar. See also funny money.
. pointing device n. A mouse or light pen.
Pokieland n. The Poughkeepsie area.
The term is
mainly used by people outside Pokieland. [There is also
a cave, in northwest Massachusetts, named “Pokie Hole”
in honour of Poughkeepsie.]
polysyllabic n. Any word of two or more syllables,
although in IBM a minimum of four is preferred. “IBM
conventional methodology involves the utilisation of
polysyllabic utterances to the maximal degree”, especial-
ly in documents for announcements.
Polysyllabics are also popular in product proposals
because they make life harder for the reviewers: the
documents take longer to read, the authors’ meaning is
less clear and therefore harder to refute, and they
discourage any comments from foreign IBM laborato-
ries.
In skilled hands, the technique can even be used
successfully between British and American English
speakers.
Example: “CICS/VS offers a functionally superior
alternative to CICS-Standard” is longer, more dazzling,
and less clear than “CICS/VS works better than
CICS-Standard”. After all, it might not actually work at
all.
pony n. Something good that may (hopefully) come out
of a bad situation.
This refers to an apocryphal story
about a hopelessly optimistic boy who was given a barn
full of horse manure by his father on his birthday.
He
immediately grabbed a shovel and started to dig, while
chanting “There must be a pony in here somewhere!”
Anything is possible if you have Faith.

ations. See POP. This acronym was used extensively in
.
FSD (Federal Systems Division) and elsewhere in the
.
late 1960s and early 1970s but is less often heard since
.
then – probably because so few now write programs in
.
assembler. Also mini-poo for the green card.
POP, POOP, POPs, p.ops (pops)
n. The manual that
defines the principles of operation of the System/360
(and, later, the System/370).
Probably the best (most
rigorous) data processing architecture document ever
written, and the source of the Ultimate Truth for many.
See also bible, POO, Princ Ops.
POR (pore)
n. Power-On Reset.
See also plan of
record. The general reset of a piece or system of hard-
ware that takes place when the equipment is first
switched (powered) on. Since all hardware requires this,
a power-off followed by power-on can often be used to
reset a machine to a known state. See Big Red Switch,
key on/key off, Poughkeepsie reset.
port 1. v. To move a program from one computer to
another – and get it to work in the new environment. If
it is said that a program is “portable”, it is intended to
convey the fanciful notion that the program can easily
be made to run on a foreign hardware or software archi-
tecture.
Ease of porting a program is highly dependent
on the porter’s point of view, increasing in proportion to
one’s distance from actually working on the problem.
2. n. A hardware interface between a computer (usually
a small one) and some peripheral hardware such as a
network or keyboard.
“The mouse is attached to port
7.” [Poor mouse.]
position 1. v. To explain or provide context to. As in:
“Let me position you on that subject”. 2. v. To describe
by providing context.
As in: “Would you first position
XXX for us?”
. Poughkeepsie Confidential
adj. Of a document:
.
unavailable.
This classification, though unofficial, is
.
nevertheless the most secure in IBM.
A Poughkeepsie
.
Confidential document cannot be distributed, even by its
.
author, without management approval (even if the
.
manager who approves the distribution is junior to both
.
the sender and the receiver). See also IBM Confidential.
Poughkeepsie reset n. An unpublished feature on all
IBM data processing equipment, this feature is actually
a switch connected directly to the main power source.
A flip of this switch (usually named the “ON/OFF
switch”) will reset 99% of all annoying device prob-
lems.
However, the trade-off for such a life-saving
capability is the probable loss of some existing data or
state information. See also POR.
pound sign 1. n. A name for the symbol “#” (two hori-
zontal lines crossed by two vertical lines). This nomen-
clature is used in some (but not all) areas of the USA;
elsewhere the symbol is known as “the number sign”,
“the octothorpe”, or simply as “hash” or occasionally
“hatch”). The musically inclined call it a “sharp”, but a
convenient way of describing it is “the tic-tac-toe
board”, or “the noughts and crosses board” (depending
on one’s heritage). 2. n. The name most often used for
the British (Sterling) currency symbol.
This is an
antique capital L (standing for libra, the Latin for
“pound”), a cursive “L” crossed horizontally by one or
two small dashes. Unfortunately it cannot be illustrated
here because of the unpredictability of printing devices.
See currency symbols.
. power cycle v. To reset, by removing and then restor-
.
ing the power to a machine. See Poughkeepsie reset.
power eraser dispenser n. The ultimate unnecessary
feature. See bells and whistles.
power suit n. The wardrobe worn by the movers and
shakers (q.v.) within an organisation. This (for a man –
women dress more subtly) consists of a dark blue three-
piece pin-striped suit, a long-sleeved white shirt, the
latest in tie design (in 1985 that was a striped tie with
the stripes pointing to the left shoulder), a black belt
with an inconspicuous buckle, thigh-high socks with
colour matching belt and shoes, and black wing-tip
shoes.
In Texas genuine lizard [or other unconserva-
tional leather] cowboy boots may be substituted for the
wing-tip shoes.
In 1983 blow-dried hair styles and
moustaches were also necessary.
power up v. To switch on.
Usually applied when the
switch-on process is complex or involves a number of
machines.
“Could you power up the system if you’re
the first in on Sunday?” See also up.

prayer meeting
prototype
prayer meeting n. A meeting, usually of a task force
that is hoping for a miracle to solve some intractable
problem. As in: “The Performance prayer meeting starts
at Two”.
preannounce v. To announce something (usually a
product) before it has been formally approved for
announcement.
precurse 1. v. To precede in the manner of a precursor;
to act as a forerunner or harbinger of an advancing tech-
nical evolution.
As in: “It is for us to precurse that
technology for the rest of the corporation”. See also
leading edge. 2. v. To offer a brief incantation prior to
divulging an innovative solution to a problem.
e.g.,
“May the fleas of a thousand diseased camels inhabit
your armpits”. See NIH.
price/performance n. An undefined measure of value-
for-money.
As in: “The XYZ offer improved
price/performance”.
Princ Ops (prince-ops)
n. A verbal abbreviation for
the System/360 (and later extensions) Principles of
Operations Manual.
Used by the System Architecture
group in Poughkeepsie, and others. See also POO, POP.
priority list n. A dynamic list of things to do, some-
times in a Virtual state, to which is attached a priority
pertaining to each item, ranging from “right away” to
“probably never”.
Usage: “I’ll put that on my priority
list”.
It is recommended that if you are on the receiving
end of this statement, you should obtain at least an
approximate date of completion.
This date, of course,
you will remember as a definite commitment. See also
time-frame, virtual, wishlist.
. proactive adj. Active, not reactive.
Used of people or
.
policies that take the initiative rather than result in inter-
.
rupt mode activity. It is also sometimes applied with the
.
sense of “teaching” or “reaching out”.
Problem Determination Guide n. A small booklet
allowing one to determine that a non-functioning (read:
broken) 3278 or 3279 terminal is indeed non-
functioning. Unfortunately, it does not give the slightest
hint about how to make it work again.
(There is a
Problem Reporting Form, however.)
problem state n. Doing something for someone else.
The System/360 (and 370) architecture recognises two
basic “states”.
One is “Supervisor State”, in which the
machine is doing work for the supervisor – usually an
operating system; and the other is “Problem State”, in
which the machine is conceptually solving problems for
the user.
[This is a rather narrow view of the
System/370 world, however, as (for example) the
VM/SP product makes both states accessible to the user
by a little “sleight of virtual machine”.]
| production program 1. n. An application program.
|
This term dates from the days when computers rarely
|
had operating systems, and instead ran just one program
|
at a time, loaded by the boot program.
If the program
|
did (or appeared to do) something of value, it was called
|
a production program. 2. n. Any program no longer
|
undergoing testing and thought to be safely operational.
production
system
1. n. floor
system
(q.v.).
2. n. The version of the operating system that you get
when you don’t do anything special (don’t take any
risks).
This is usually the system being used by the
people who are sitting around at terminals and actually
being productive.
| productize v. To give an unfinished piece of software
|
or hardware the appearance and form of a finished prod-
|
uct. As in: “Productization is taking place on all levels”
|
[sigh].
product number n. The four digit number that identi-
fies every major IBM hardware product.
The numbers
rarely have any relationship to each other but sometimes
some sort of sequence may be followed (e.g., 3350,
3370, 3380 are all disk storage devices). See also model,
part number.
product tester n. Someone who tests products.
Those
who have been to the mountain; keepers of the word;
interpreters of the Specifications.
Sometimes disliked
by developers, these were the people that really did
assure that products were high quality before their
mission was changed and they became paper-pushers
[through no fault of their own].
Research has shown
that most were given chemistry sets or electronic kits at
an impressionable age by well meaning parents.
professional n. An employee who is not a manager.
“Our professionals are the best in the business.”
Often
used as an euphemism for “technician”.
| professors n. The staff of the IBM Israel Scientific
|
Centre, at Haifa.
A mildly derogatory term used by
|
marketing people in Israel that also implies a grudging
|
respect; a remarkably high proportion of that staff are
|
indeed professors.
PROFS (profs) 
1. n. Professional Office System.
A
menu-based system that provides support for office
personnel [such as White House staff], using IBM
mainframes.
Acclaimed for its diary mechanisms, and
accepted as one way to introduce computers to those
who don’t know any better. Not acclaimed for its flexi-
bility.
.
PROFS featured in the international news in 1987,
.
and revealed a subtle class distinction within the ranks
.
of the Republican Administration in the USA. It seems
.
that Hall, the secretary interviewed at length during the
.
Iran-Contra hearings, called certain shredded documents
.
“PROFS notes” [as do IBMers who use the system].
.
However, North, MacFarlane, and other professional
.
staff used the term “PROF notes”. 2. v. To send a piece
of electronic mail, using PROFS.
“PROFS me a one-
liner on that.” [A PROFS one-liner has up to one line of
content, and from seven to seventeen lines of boiler
plate.] See also VNET.
. program manager n. A person who is a manager of a
.
project or product but who (by design) has no employ-
.
ees reporting to him or her.
See also card-carrying
.
manager.
programmer n. A machine for converting ideas into
practice.
programming n. The art of debugging a blank sheet of
paper.
progress v. To make progress with arranging.
As in:
“We are progressing your promotion”. (Use: Rare.)
proof v. To run a spelling checker program against a
document.
From the VM program called PROOF.
Mainly used, in the UK, to check documents before
sending them to readers in the USA who are sensitive to
British spelling.
protocol n. A sequence of events or exchanges of infor-
mation defined to enable two machines or programs to
communicate with each other.
This bears slight
relationship to the usual senses of this word, but does
correctly convey the flavours of solemnity and complex-
ity that are associated with such communication.
prototype 1. n. The first implementation of some idea
in the form originally envisioned for it by the original
innovator.
Generally unrelated in form, function, and
cost to the final production version. 2. v. a) To imple-
ment a working system fast, i.e., by “unconventional”
methods. b) To implement a “model” system that has to

racheck
be replaced by a “proper” system later [lest anyone
realise how simple programming is].
PSE (pee-ess-eee)
n. Preliminary Sales Estimate.
A
qualified guess at how many units of a product will be
sold.
Nobody except a forecaster can explain why this
is different from a forecast.
PTF n. Program Temporary Fix. This is an official IBM
temporary fix.
The abbreviation is used so often that
most people don’t know what it stands for.
PTFs are
permanent fixes in some systems, which has led to the
false definition of permanent temporary fix.
PTM n. Program Trouble Memorandum. The same as an
APAR (q.v.), but generated internally, before a program
is shipped.
Also known as PTR (Program Trouble
Report); both are sometimes used as verbs.
| pubs 1. n. The Publications (now “Information Devel-
|
opment”) department of a Development Laboratory.
|
2. n. The publications (manuals, books, and brochures)
|
associated with a hardware or software product. See fix
|
it in pubs. 3. n. The name of a program that provides a
|
user interface to the ProcessMaster product. “I’m a full-
|
time PUBS user now!”
pulse n. A temporary change in the level of a logic
.
signal.
It is difficult, nowadays, to observe the very
.
short pulses in fast computers with ordinary electronic
.
equipment such as oscilloscopes – the capacitance of the
.
leads connecting the oscilloscope to the computer will
.
degrade and sometimes destroy the information in the
.
signal being inspected.
A story from the not-so-recent
.
days of 3033 development is related by an engineer who
.
looked over the shoulder of his colleague and
.
commented “That’s a mighty noisy line, Joe”.
Joe
.
looked up and replied “Them’s good bits, Ken”.
The
.
bits were seven nano-seconds wide.
A pulse that is in the wrong place (and, usually, is
shorter than an intentional one) is known as a glitch
(q.v.).
punch v. To transmit data electronically from one disk
pack to another.
Often these disk packs can be around
the world from one another but just as often can be the
exact same one.
A VM/370 term, from the use of a
virtual card punch to send data from one virtual machine
to [the virtual reader of] another.
Usage: “Punch me
that jargon file”.
purple wire n. The wire shipped with a feature change
to the IBM 1130 and 1800 Systems. Also referred to as
personality wire.
Used and required to tell the soft-
ware about the hardware installed on a system, and its
address.
A change here is Most Frightening to the
“Sensor based” Customer Engineer.
See also yellow
wire, blue wire.
push iron v. To make a living by selling hardware.
Formerly referred to those salespersons who sold only
large mainframe computers. Also pump iron. See also
pig iron.
put a stake in the ground v. To stabilize a fluid or
confused situation.
For example, to provide a focus or
leader for a group effort.
Also put a stake in the
grid.
put in place v. To complete. As in: “Do you have the
plan of record put in place yet?”
puzzle palace n. A building in which the computer
room has expanded beyond its original boundaries.
Buildings 701, 920, and 921 in Poughkeepsie are prime
examples: some aisles dead-end at a printer box-room,
and then resume on the other side of the room.
This
may be adapted from a favoured nickname for the NSA
(National Security Agency) in the USA.
. qfoic (queue-foe-ic)
v. To display or update the micro-
.
code configuration on a 43xx computer.
This name
.
comes from the “fast-path” incantation used to access
.
the menu for changing UCWs (Unit Control Words).
quad n. The character formed of a simple rectangle of
lines, used in the APL language for various mysterious
purposes. Conjures up memories of glorious University
afternoons to many.
qualified adj. Of a part (piece of hardware): tested six
ways from Monday (sic) and approved for use in IBM
products.
Generally a well known product (such as a
TTL “7400” quadruple NAND) whose identity is subse-
quently disguised behind a twelve-digit IBM part
number.
Since the original part number is no longer
available, the only specifications available are those
produced by the Fishkill testing lab – which tend to give
no hint of what the part really is.
Quality n. A once-popular hot button characterised by
the slogan: “do it right the first time” (q.v.). A laudable
aim, pounced upon with glee by product managers who
claim that they do their design right, first time, and that
therefore testing with real users is obviously a waste of
time.
In an extraordinary use of English, an official
definition of “quality” defines it as Conformance to
Requirements. [Not in this Dictionary!]
.
A 1987 Quality poster put it this way: “Quality: A
.
place for everything, and everything in it’s (sic) place”.
Quality Circle n. A group of people gathered together
to celebrate the cause of Quality, and sometimes to bring
forth good ideas for increasing the sum of product quali-
ty. Said to be the most perfectly formed closed loop of
ideas around which a group can travel continually only
to to get nowhere that they haven’t been before.
. quarter 1. n. A three-month portion of a year. The unit
.
of time used when a “month” is too precise, as in: “We
.
will announce in 2Q88” [second quarter, 1988]. half is
.
sometimes used, in a similar manner, when plans are
.
even less definite. 2. n. A quarter of a byte (half a
nybble).
Also two bits – a reference to the old coins
which broke apart to make change, the pirate’s Pieces of
Eight.
[This isn’t in very common usage, but the
incestuous puns may please.]
quick and dirty adj. Of software or hardware: produced
in a hurry to meet an urgent request or to fix a problem,
usually someone else’s. One’s own solution is usually a
prototype (q.v.).
Also used to imply inferiority, or to
defer a simple request from an end user, as in: “I can
give you a quick and dirty solution in four weeks
[which will do exactly what you want] but a real
solution [which will do exactly what I want] will take
eight months”.
| quiesce v. To halt after finishing the current task. This
|
term is often used to describe the process of stopping
|
the flow of data across a network link, or to some
|
device such as a printer, so that maintenance of some
|
kind can be done.
As in: “We’re quiescing the link
|
now; you can have the machine as soon as that last file
|
is through.”
R&I n. A Read and Initial memorandum.
A form of
memo circulated with the intention of its being read by
an entire department in a timely fashion.
The progress
of circulation is indicated by the initials of the readers
(and sometimes the date when it is read).
Generally
completes the cycle 2 to 4 months later, if at all, and is
therefore an extremely useful way of delaying a decision
on a document more or less indefinitely.
racheck (rack-check)
n. The RACF security system’s
primary macro call to check authorisation of an action;
often used as a verb.
In technical usage this term is
neither good nor bad, and just indicates a place where
RACF will check for authority.
In common usage, it

raft 
recurse
means access that (apparently capriciously) is denied; as
in: “I could have finished that project last night but I got
rachecked so many times I gave up”.
raft 1. n. A collection of programming ideas, loosely
bound together and floated as a suggestion for a new
software release.
As in: “We are proposing a 15K raft
of improvements”.
In a streamlined development proc-
ess there can be a close resemblance between the raft
and the First Customer Ship (FCS).
[Though it may
surprise you that anyone could confuse a raft and a
ship.] 2. v. To put forward as a suggestion. “Let’s raft
that at the meeting tomorrow.” 3. n. Something flat,
untidy and of practical use only to its designer.
| rainbow book n. Nickname for GH09-0242 The Nature
|
of Office Systems, a document, distributed to thousands
|
of customers in 1984-6, that chronicled IBM Canada’s
|
experiences in installing Office Systems.
So called
|
because of the photograph of a rainbow over the Rocky
|
Mountains on the otherwise black cover.
. raindance n. A complicated sequence of steps (includ-
.
ing some physical activity), required to achieve some
.
goal. It may include a few incantations as well as more
.
tangible actions (such as mounting tapes, flicking
.
switches, etc.).
. raised floor n. An area where a large computer installa-
.
tion can be found. Named because the computers stand
.
on a false floor which is elevated some distance above
.
the “real” floor of the building, in order to leave space
.
for the boas (q.v.) to prowl. Usage: “We can put that in
.
the raised floor”, or “Site XXXX will be down Memori-
.
al Day weekend.
This will include system YYYY also
.
since it is on the raised floor that will be down.”
ramp v. To increase.
From the A/FE Corporate News
Letter, 31 May 1985: Q. “What’s the latest update on
PC/AT delivery shipments? Are you still encountering
supply shortages?” – A. “Demand for the AT has
exceeded our expectations, although we are ramping up
production of enhanced AT’s with additional fixed drive
sources”.
The reader is referred to the Concise Oxford
Dictionary for some alternative definitions of “ramp”
that may be appropriate in some circumstances.
rat belt n. A cable tie.
Small cable ties are mouse
belts.
rattle some cages v. To do things, (writing memos,
making phone calls, sending VNET messages, etc.) that
will make someone unhappy.
Generally done because
they have made you unhappy. “I’m going to rattle some
cages and see if I can get this spec changed.”
RDR (reader)
n. An abbreviation for reader (q.v.).
From the VM standard name for the virtual card reader.
reach-around n. Communication which does not just
go up the management chain or down it, but rather goes
up the chain and then returns directly to the original
level as a response. Use: extremely rare.
read v. To move data from one real or virtual disk pack
on your system to another.
A VM/370 term, derived
from the READCARD command that was used to move
virtual cards from the virtual card reader to a virtual
disk. Usually the source disk pack (the virtual reader) is
owned by the spool system and the destination disk pack
is dedicated to a user. Usage: “Please read that new file
onto your disk”. See also receive.
reader n. A temporary place on a disk pack to place
data until a user decides exactly what to do with it, or it
is destroyed by a cold start. From “virtual card reader”.
Also used as a place on a disk pack where one user puts
data so that another user has a good chance of finding
it, and as a system-owned area of space to store data if
your private space allocation is not large enough. See
also read.
. reader eater n. A computer program that automatically
.
processes the files in a reader.
Typically used to
.
discard unwanted messages and to maintain private
.
copies of forums.
It may be coincidence that “reader”
.
and “eater” rhyme in the speech of many North Ameri-
.
cans.
real estate n. A resource of some kind that is both
physical and two-dimensional.
Examples: a) A small
area of land purchased to build facilities for creating
things; b) A large area of land purchased to build bigger
facilities for administering the facilities for creating
things; c) That area of floor space in a machine room
that is just too small for the new machine that you need;
d) That area of a desktop that is too full of other things
to permit the siting of a terminal in a convenient posi-
tion (see also footprint); e) That area of a silicon chip
which is too small to permit the incorporation of the
function required to make the chip useful.
. real IBM n. That portion of IBM which is not part of the
.
Research Division. Used in the Research Division. See
.
also real life.
reality check n. A comparison between an idealistic
point of view and a pragmatic point of view. Employed
when design groups come up for fresh air (or peer
review) when deliberating alternatives for new features.
See also sanity check.
| real life n. The field (q.v.). Used by people consigned or
|
resigned to working in Headquarters locations, as in
|
“He’s probably right, he just came from real life”.
See
|
also real IBM.
real money n. See blue money.
real storage 1. n. The main storage in a computer.
This term widely replaced “core” when the latter term
became out-dated.
For example, “This machine has 8
MB real storage”, meaning 8 Megabytes of (physical)
main storage. 2. n. Hardware (physical) storage in
contrast to virtual (imaginary) storage.
This term was
precise in the days of early System/370 computers,
which could only have one processing unit. 3. n. An
imaginary representation of the physical storage of a
computer. This sense of the term was necessary for the
multiprocessing System/370, such as the 158MP and
168MP models. Here there could be more physical stor-
age than (in theory) the processors could address.
Increased performance was possible by providing each
processor with its own bank of real storage (here called
absolute 
storage 
to 
minimise 
or 
maximise
confusion).
rearrange deck chairs on the Titanic v. To perform
pointless actions; a description for frantic, useless
endeavours in the face of an impending disaster.
This
derives from IBM Canada, where it was applied to
measures designed to head off a slipped ship date.
receive v. To initiate the movement of a file from the
spool system onto a private disk. As in: “When you get
the file in your reader, please receive it”. Derived from
the name of the program used to move the file.
See
read.
| recognition event n. A gathering to which employees
|
may be invited as a reward for their achievements.
|
Awards may be presented, or some of the activities may
|
be simply entertaining or not directly productive.
|
Usage: “We proposed holding the Technical Forum at a
|
non-IBM site near the ocean, but rescheduled to Dallas
|
so it wouldn’t be construed as a recognition event.”
recurse v. To recur.
Not to be confused with the
repeated invocation of a spell or oath. Almost certainly
derived from the adjective recursive.
45

recursive 
retread
recursive adj. Referring to itself. See recursive.
recycle v. To bring a system down and then restart it.
Used especially for whole systems (“recycle the 3081”),
but also to a sub-system (“JES2 was acting flaky, so I
had them recycle it”).
. redeploy n. A person from an IBM plant, laboratory, or
.
HQ location who has accepted a position in a marketing
.
organisation.
As in: “Debbie’s a redeploy from
.
Poughkeepsie”.
| red layer n. Applications software. See layer.
red line card n. A logic card not made to normal
production standards, so deemed not suitable for use in
production machines.
Marked with a red line which
acts as a warning. See also gold card.
reference 1. n. A document that is the ultimate source
of information about a piece of software or hardware.
To write a good reference is one of the most difficult
technical writing tasks. Note that almost by definition a
reference is only useful when you already know some-
thing about the object in question, and is often almost
useless to a new user.
Usage: “This document is not a
tutorial, it is a reference”. 2. n. A cross-reference from
one program routine to another.
In general, a cross-
reference from one storage location (address) to another.
3. v. To refer to.
The verb formed from “Reference
(2)”.
As 
in: 
“The 
allocate 
routine 
references
HIGHMEM to find out how much storage is available”.
Also seen in documentation: “You may also want to
reference the CMS Command and Macro Reference.”
. refresh n. A new copy of a (software) package. Getting
.
a refresh implies that you are installing the whole pack-
.
age again as a precaution against having missed some
.
partial update in the past.
A package for which
.
refreshes will no longer be provided may be considered
.
frozen.
Registered IBM Confidential adj. The highest level of
confidential information.
Printed copies are numbered,
and a record is kept of everyone who sees the docu-
ment. This level of information may not usually be held
on computer systems, which makes preparation of such
documents a little tricky.
It is said that RIC designates
information which is a) technically useless, but whose
perceived value increases with the level of management
observing it; or b) is useful, but which is now inaccessi-
ble because everyone is afraid to have custody of the
documents. See also candy-striped.
regression bucket n. A set of test cases to run against
a product during development to check that things that
used to work still do, or to allow the measurement of
any change in performance.
See also bucket, test
bucket.
| regular employee n. A fully benefited IBM employee.
|
Once upon a time almost all employees enjoyed all priv-
|
ileges; nowadays a third of the workforce in some coun-
|
tries are freelance, employed for a year or two at most.
reinvent the wheel v. To do something that has
already been done. A derogatory phrase, mainly used to
prevent someone from writing a system correctly now
that he or she has become familiar, through experience,
with what should have been done in the past.
release n. The software prepared for shipment to
customers.
All the code that a development group has
produced by some arbitrary date, sometimes regardless
of whether it works.
. release-to-print n. A declaration, by a document’s
.
technical owner, that the material is correct and
.
complete and may be sent to the printer.
release x n. (Where x is some number larger than that
of the current release.) Never-never land. “Well, that’s
a nice function – we’ll put it in Release 6.”
Cynically
implies that no Release 6 will take place.
remap n. A machine whose logic design has been entire-
ly or largely taken from an earlier machine and
re-implemented in a newer (usually denser) technology.
The 370/148 was a remap of the 370/145, for example.
rep 1. n. Short for “Marketing Representative”. The rep
is IBM’s primary contact with the customer. IBM holds
the rep responsible for the account, hence the rep has
nominal final say on everyone else’s contact with the
customer.
An IBMer in a laboratory, for example,
should usually only call a customer with the rep’s
approval.
Unlike an SE (System Engineer), reps are
paid on commission and are seldom very technical.
2. n. An
incurable
(but
rich)
optimist.
3. n. For
systems, the lead account rep is the System Archi-
tect, designing and assembling a system for the custom-
er from the various boxes and programs found in the
Sales Manual. If successful in beating great odds doing
this, a rep is rewarded handsomely by both cash and
company-sponsored trips.
If unsuccessful, he (or she)
may just vanish like Carroll’s Cheshire Cat, which
“disappeared quite slowly, beginning with the end of the
tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some
time after the rest of it had gone”. 4. v. To directly
alter the compiled version of a program.
Derived from
the “REP” (replace) command used in object code card
decks (such as system load, SuperZap, and System/360
object code decks). See also code, zap.
| repository n. A cavernous storage area where data may
|
be found. Programmers in the 1970s spent many adven-
|
turous hours searching for the repository; programmers
|
in the 1980s spent even more hours creating a new one.
| repurpose v. To save some equipment from the scrap-
|
heap by, for example, reprogramming it to do something
|
useful.
requirement 1. n. A feature that must be included in a
product as otherwise someone will non-concur.
There-
fore, the best way to get a new feature into a product is
to persuade a third party to describe it as a requirement.
Conversely, it is very hard to get anything truly innova-
tive into a product, as (since no one else had thought of
it) there can hardly be a requirement for it. 2. n. A
function or quality that must be included in a product, as
otherwise it will be considered unsaleable to some
selection of end users.
resource 1. n. Any commodity (usually in a computer
system) that may be in short supply (memory, CPU
instruction cycles, etc.).
A singularisation used for
effect, as in: “If we try and run the printer and modem
simultaneously, we’ll just run out of resource”.
Use of
this word also avoids committing oneself to a statement
of which of the (un)available resources will be the limit-
ing factor. Also used as a euphemism for headcount, or
|
[insultingly] for an individual. 2. v. To allocate, or find,
|
the resources needed for a project. Usage: “How are we
|
going to resource the follow-on?”
RETAIN n. A database and network that contains refer-
ences to many of the problems found using IBM equip-
ment and software, together with a solution for the
problem (if known).
This term is an acronym for
Remote Technical Assistance Information Network, but
is also used as a verb. “Let’s RETAIN that one.”
retread n. A Re-trainee – someone who has been trained
to do a new job, which is not necessarily his or her
vocation. Not a nice term. For example, it may refer to
a planner or engineer who has become a programmer
after 90 days of programming school.

retrofit 
Rusty Bucket
retrofit 1. v. To add a needed feature to a piece of soft-
ware or hardware rather later than it should have been
added.
Usually results in inelegant architecture.
2. v. To merge.
A standard procedure in some divi-
sions: laboratories A and B work on a project independ-
ently for a time, then each “retrofit” their updates to the
other’s work performed in the meantime.
A sensitive
political situation arises when one group’s updates must
be “retrofitted” because of unexpected changes made to
lower-level updates by another group. 3. v. To adapt
existing local modifications of a program (usually an
operating system) to fit a new release of the program.
retro-upgrade 1. v. To apply appropriate correctional
and preventive maintenance to a software product (such
as a System Control Program) that is significantly out-
of-date and generally not of the same level for which
the maintenance was designed. This takes place when a
product that has been functionally stabilized is suddenly
seen to have new market potential. 2. v. To change the
base source for a new release of a software product
(again, usually a System Control Program) from that
new release to an older release (for purposes of upward
compatibility).
. reverse emulate v. To make an IBM computer or
.
terminal behave as though it were the equipment of a
.
competitor. This is considered to be retrograde, akin to
.
emulating a Volkswagen with a Porsche, hence the
.
“reverse” modifier.
. reversion (ree-version)
v. To change the version
.
number.
Usually a step following a significant change
.
or enhancement to a product.
“Can we reprice without
.
reversioning?”
. revisit (ree-visit)
v. Of a problem or issue: to discuss
.
again.
As in: “Well, we aren’t going to solve that
.
today; we’ll have to revisit it in the next meeting”.
revival hour n. A weekly meeting with the purpose of
getting Engineering and Programming functions talking
to each other. The term is a reference to the essentially
“religious” (i.e., superstitious) nature of the discussions
that take place during these meetings.
Rexxpert n. An expert in the REXX language.
A
Rexxpert of long standing is known as a Rexpert, for
historical reasons.
| RFA n. Request For Announcement.
The primary,
|
formal, document that is the core of the announce proc-
|
ess and product release.
RFAs for major announce-
|
ments may circulate (in various versions) for months
|
before announce, with hundreds of reviewers on the
|
distribution list. At any one time there are thousands of
|
RFAs in circulation.
| RISC n. Raleigh International Systems Center. (Now the
|
International Technical Support Center – Raleigh.)
See
|
also RISC technology.
RISC 
technology 
(risk
technology)
n. Reduced
Instruction Set Computer Technology (as used in the
|
IBM RT PC and the RISC System/6000 series). In IBM
parlance, this means the 32-bit 801 Minicomputer Archi-
tecture devised at the Yorktown Heights location (the
T. J. Watson Research Center), building 801.
The
prototype for this machine used 24-bit wire-wrapped
Emitter Coupled Logic, and was therefore a surprising
triumph over electrical noise; the integrated circuit
version of this architecture is rather more compact, and
rather more reliable.
RIT date (writ-date)
n. The moment of commitment to
the design of an integrated circuit chip.
RIT stands for
Release Interface Tape. This “tape” is the collection of
information necessary to process and test a chip.
It is
no longer moved from place to place on a magnetic
tape, but is sent electronically.
road n. Used in NAD to signify anywhere that “action”
takes place.
“Where the rubber meets the road”.
See
also sky.
rococo adj. Of a program or machine: having many
fancy frills and curlicues that add no function. A refer-
ence to the highly ornamental style of art prevalent in
Europe circa 1730-1780.
The word can also imply
antiquity, in the sense of “out-of-date”. Similar to bells
and whistles.
ROJ (rodge)
adj. Retired On the Job.
A common
designation for petty bureaucrats and others simply
marking time.
Some of these can actually tell an
enquirer the number of days they have before their offi-
cial retirements. See also IPR, gold-coaster.
| roll out v. To deliver or announce a product or series of
|
products.
As in: “Here’s how we’ll roll out the mid-
|
range boxes”.
Also rollout n. A delivery schedule or
|
plan. “Can I see the rollout for the P and N series?”
. roll your own 1. adj. Non-IBM, ad hoc.
This term is
.
often used when referring to a customer’s software
.
which was “home grown” but for which there seems to
.
be an equivalent IBM product.
e.g., “This customer
|
runs a RYO teleprocessing system”. 2. adj. Of IBM
|
software: self-tailored.
Typically used to describe a
|
system assembled and configured by the customer from
|
a selection of software components offered by IBM.
ROLMan (rolm-an)
n. An employee of the ROLM
|
company, after it became a division of IBM and before
|
it was sold to Siemens in 1989.
An alternative term is
ROLMulan.
| round and brown n. Magnetic storage, especially large
|
and fast disks.
From the iron oxide colour, and shape,
|
of most magnetic disks [modern high-density disks are
|
no longer brown]. As in: “storing data on the round and
|
brown”. Also known as rusty memory.
RPQ n. Request for Price Quotation (for an infrequently
requested feature, such as upper/lower case, or compat-
ibility with earlier products). The RPQ “route” is taken
to get an important modification or enhancement to a
product in a shorter time than can be achieved through
the formal requirement and release cycle.
RTFM v. Read The oFficial Manual.
Used, with vari-
ations on the third word, to suggest to someone that
instead of wasting another’s time with questions the
manual should be consulted.
[It has been pointed out
that RTFM is not the most expressive term.
The alter-
nate form RTFB (where B is for Book) is preferred by
native speakers of English, since “Manual” is from the
French but “Book” is a suitable and short four-letter
English word, which better fits the slogan.]
| rubber n. See road, sky.
| rubber bands on wrists n. A sign of an old-timer.
|
Decks of cards were often held together with a rubber
|
band; so essential was this tool for programmers that
|
many kept a few conveniently sized bands constantly
|
available to hand [as it were].
. rupt n. An interrupt (q.v.).
Rusty Bucket n. A group headquarters in Bethesda,
Maryland; often shortened to simply Bucket.
The
outer skin of the building is an alloy designed to react
with water and standard metropolitan pollutants to “rust
pretty” on the surface. Lacking the requisite pollutants,
the building just plain rusted.
Its distinctive qualities make it one of the places in
the Washington (DC), area for which [it’s said] no
address is required.
You can tell a cab driver that you
want to go to the Rusty Bucket and you’ll get there.
You can mail a letter to the Rusty Bucket, Bethesda,
MD and it’ll get there.

rusty iron
secretary of task forces
rusty iron n. Out-of-date, hard-to-repair equipment that,
when it works, does the job better and cheaper than
anything to be found in the current sales manual.
(Especially true of non-IBM electrical or mechanical
tools.) See also pig iron, tired iron.
| SAA (ess-ay-ay)
n. Systems Application Architecture.
|
A collection of interfaces (to users, for programmers,
|
and for communicating with other computers) that most
|
of IBM’s major product lines are committed to support.
|
To be SAA is to be strategic (q.v.). “Is it SAA?”
. safe n. Any filing cabinet that has a combination lock
.
(instead of a key lock).
Also known as an “approved
.
container”, such a cabinet may be used for the legal
.
storage of USA Government classified documents.
salary plan n. A document rumoured to explain why
managers get paid more than technical personnel, and
why employees in different countries get paid different
amounts for earning the same amount of revenue for the
company.
Salt Mine n. Hutchinson, Kansas, where many vital
records are sent. There are stories of huge underground
caverns, whence was mined rock-salt, filled with salty
tapes and documents. See also Iron Mountain, Wansdyke.
Sammy Cobol n. See Susie Cobol.
sandbender n. A person directly involved with silicon
lithography and the physical design of chips. Not to be
confused with logic designers, most of whom (it is said)
would not recognise a transistor if they stepped on it
with bare feet.
[Possibly because it is more painful to
step on a 14-pin Dual-In-Line package than on a transis-
tor?]
sandbox 1. n. A location or department where the
immediate goal is not a product or product support (or
where the goal should be a product, but isn’t).
The
Sandbox Division is the Research Division.
Almost
always used in a derogatory sense. See also adtech, fun
|
& games, trivial. 2. n. The Washington Systems Center
|
experimental laboratory.
So described in authoritative
|
presentations, 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
node 
name
|
WSCSNDBX (officially “WSC Systems Networking
|
Development BoX”).
3. v. To prototype something, to
|
experiment.
As in: “I can’t tell you if that will work,
|
now; we’ll have to sandbox it”. 4. v. To spend time on
|
a project or subject which is of particular interest but is
|
outside your area of responsibility, especially when you
|
had no intention of doing so. As in: “We went in to get
|
approval to repaint the cafeteria, but ended up
|
sandboxing the merits of intelligent workstations for two
|
hours.” See also hobby.
| sandwich file n. A spool file that contains more than
|
one operating system (logical) file. Such a file provides
|
one method of introducing unwanted or undercover files
|
into a system.
. sanity check n. A second, pragmatic, opinion or esti-
.
mate.
“Let’s recalculate that as a sanity check.” Also
.
used in the sense of informal verification, “Are you still
.
there?
Does this address still work?” See also reality
.
check.
| sardine can n. The small square metallic package used
|
for many IBM chips over the years.
Vendor chips
|
usually come in plastic or ceramic packages. Also
|
Burlington sardine can.
scaffold v. To provide temporary layers of software
either at a higher or at a lower level than a routine to be
tested, in order to simulate the normal conditions of use.
“You’ll have to scaffold that code if you expect us to
test it in August.”
. scalarize v. To turn good APL into bad APL (by
.
removing all vector and matrix operations) for the
.
purpose of translating it to bad FORTRAN [or ADA].
.
The bad FORTRAN is then manually translated into
.
(hopefully) good FORTRAN. It is often faster to proto-
.
type a function in APL, scalarize it, and then translate it
.
to FORTRAN than it would be to work in FORTRAN
.
to begin with. With the advent of vector processors this
.
practice is slowly becoming obsolete.
. scenario level n. A service [I think].
As in: “This
.
decision would, in general, also provide your customers
.
with a better scenario level”.
(Circulated to approxi-
.
mately 100,000 people by an IBM Director.)
. scenario walkthrough n. A meeting in which the
.
designers of a product outline the expected use of a
.
product, in the form of various scenarios, and then
.
describe how the product will behave in each case. See
.
also inspection.
scenic route n. A slow path through an Electronic
Network.
“Hey, my file hasn’t got to VM yet” ...
“Which node did you send it through?” ... “K31” ...
“Ah! That’s the RSCSSNA scenic route”.
SCIDS (skids)
n. A 6-hour social occasion, held every
night of SHARE and GUIDE meetings, during which
customers (sometimes successfully) ply IBMers with
alcoholic beverages in plastic cups to try to find out
what’s coming next.
Originally informally known as
“Share Committee for Inebriates, Drunkards, and Sots”,
but now officially stands for “Social Contact and
Informal Discussion Sessions” or “SHARE Committee
for Informal Discussion Sessions”.
More familiarly
known as the “Society for Cultivation of Indiscretions
via Drinking Sessions.”
Scientific Centre n. A research (not Research) labora-
tory dedicated to performing computing research of
interest to people outside IBM. Projects are justified on
their relevance to the non-IBM wider technical commu-
nity.
scope v. To delve into or investigate.
“We’ll have to
scope it before we can come up with a firm answer.”
This 
term 
derives 
from 
the 
abbreviation 
for
Oscilloscope, which used to be the tool of the first line
of investigation for any tricky electronic problem.
scratch v. To erase or delete. “Please scratch the tape”.
Scratching is always a deliberate action, rather than an
accident.
Also used as an adjective “This is a Scratch
Tape”, which implies that the tape is being used for
temporary data and may therefore be scratched after use.
The term Scratch is involved in one of the finest
known examples of error messages.
There is a utility
used for mounting tapes, called MOUNT.
If this
command is invoked with the parameters “MOUNT
SCRATCH 181 RING” (a request to mount a scratch
tape, with a ring to indicate that it may be over-written),
the utility will in due course respond with the error
message: VLIB09010S
'SCRATCH' MUST BE
SPELLED W/O THE 'A'.
script v. To format a document for printing. SCRIPT is
the name of the command used to invoke the most
widely used IBM formatter, the Document Composition
Facility. “If you script this dictionary onto a page print-
er you’ll save a lot of paper.”
. seamless adj. Of two or more programs: melded in
.
such a way that the resulting package appears to have
.
been designed as an entity. See also transparent.
secretary of task forces n. A person within a labora-
tory, site, division, or other operating unit who takes on
the tasks of keeping interim and final reports for all task
forces in his or her domain. A second function is advis-
ing leaders (Task Force chairpersons) and providing

security 
silver bullet
minutes about previous Task Forces on similar subjects.
If the information thus collected were used by higher
management, the Secretary would save many
person
hours.
security n. Any aspect of company operations that
protects assets, people, or face.
One of IBM’s most
enduring interests.
Fuelled by
court-cases and viruses,
security became the hot button of the 1980s. Nearly all
the useful and workable security precautions have long
since been in place, so now that it has become a hot
button security departments have had to bring in a
whole new range of security measures to show that they
are doing something.
Where physical security is
involved, they usually do a good job [though a new
concept, that if an IBMer wears two badges he will be
twice as secure, is somewhat suspect]. By contrast, the
requirements for data processing security seem hastily
thrown together and have undeniably affected the ability
of IBMers to do their work.
The net result, of course,
has been dissatisfaction – which used to be unheard of
in IBM, and is in fact the only real security exposure.
send to the world v. To distribute a piece of software
electronically, as in: “That’s good enough; OK, send it
to the world”.
This really does mean “to the world” –
software sent over VNET can reach fifty countries in a
matter of hours or even minutes [especially at
Christmas-time].
senior bit n. The most significant bit in a byte.
separate v. To let go, persuade to leave, or fire. Usage:
“I think it’s time he was separated from the business”.
| sequoia n. The unit of measure of a product specifica-
|
tion document, that is, the number of exceptionally large
|
trees required to produce the quantity of paper necessary
|
to print the document. In some circles, the size of such
|
a document is held to correlate directly [or inversely]
|
with the quality of the project described therein. See
|
also three-tree report.
service 1. v. To handle [an interrupt].
It should be
noted that interrupt handlers seldom appear in AI
programs. 2. v. To fix bugs in a machine or program.
See critical service.
service machine n. A userid running under VM (q.v.)
that instead of being the “desk” of a human user, is
instead just a virtual machine that runs a program with
little or no human supervision. The program may carry
out simple (though non-trivial) services such as sending
diary reminders to users, or it may carry out far more
complex tasks such as managing the security, data, or
backups for an installation. The service machine is such
a powerful concept that many locations run dozens of
them, and for much of the time the service machines
outnumber the real people using the computer (and
sometimes use more resources, too). See also discon-
nected.
. settle down v. Of a new version of a program: to have
.
the most obvious problems fixed.
Often, installing a
.
new release of system software uncovers all kinds of
.
problems, and one must wait until the stirred-up system
.
has settled down before installing new applications.
Seven Dwarves n. A term describing the most signif-
icant companies in data processing in the USA in the
1960s – other than IBM.
Originally the expression
“IBM and the Seven Dwarves” described the entire
computer industry.
The Dwarves were Burroughs,
Honeywell, NCR, Univac, RCA, General Electric, and
the new upstart, CDC.
Since then RCA and GE have
.
dropped out, while Burroughs and (Sperry)-Univac have
.
merged to form Unisys, so now there are four.
Some
.
consider DEC to have become sufficiently respectable to
.
constitute a fifth, and Microsoft’s chairman has suffi-
.
cient renown for his company to be considered a sixth,
but no present-day seventh comes to mind. Dwarves are
at least in principle exempt from the definitions of mini-
computer and vector processor since they are deemed to
produce “ordinary” computers like IBM. Of course, the
term should really be “Seven Dwarflings”?
See also
Bunch.
shadow n. A copy of a conferencing facility (q.v.) disk
which is maintained as up-to-date as possible by manual
or automatic methods.
The distortion between files of
the master system and those of the shadow is a counter-
example to Einstein’s postulate about the constancy of
the speed of light on computer networks. See also
catcher, master, pitcher.
shadow-sitter n. The individual who maintains a shad-
ow (usually on a part-time basis). Shadow-sitters are an
expanding breed within IBM and have a folklore all of
their own, such as tales of the great IBMPC crash of
June ’84.
. sheep dip session n. A sales seminar, usually on a
.
vague topic such as Computer Integrated Manufacturing,
.
which is intended for a large audience of generally poor
.
prospects.
Often planned by staff managers to improve
.
Year-to-date buns on seats performance.
ship 1. v. To move a product from a point A to a point
B (even if the vehicle or mode of transport would inevi-
tably sink if placed on the surface of an ocean).
It is
possible to ship items by road, rail, aeroplane or even by
|
electronic networks. 2. v. To become available.
As in:
|
“This version may never ship externally”, or “When
|
does AS/400 ship?” See customer ship, FCS.
shop n. The Data Processing section of an Information
Service 
(IS).
Also 
commonly 
used 
to 
mean
“department”, as in IS shop, DP shop, etc.
. short adj. Of a DASD string: having fewer DASD units
.
than the head of string unit can support.
This will
.
usually improve performance, but takes more floor space
.
and dollars (the controller:DASD ratio is higher than it
.
could be). See also A-Box, Model A.
. short card n. A PC expansion card or adapter that will
.
fit in one of the two “short” spaces located behind the
.
diskette drives on some PCs. See also tall card.
showstopper 1. n. An unfixed bug of such a serious
nature that it is likely to cause a crash. 2. n. An unsur-
mountable problem that may kill (halt) a project.
3. n. An event that became an unforgettable lowlight of
someone’s life.[In common usage this word means
almost precisely the opposite of the above; a section of
a performance that is so good that applause interrupts
the show.]
shriek n. An exclamation mark (point).
This usage is
especially popular among APL users.
Also sometimes
called a bang. See also splat.
sidecar n. An expansion box for the late PCjr.
So
named because it came as a unit that attached to the side
of the processor box.
[The “jr” in PCjr apparently was
intended to suggest the title “Junior”, and has little to do
with television soap operas set in Texas; even so, the
cry of “who shot JR?” can often be heard abroad.]
| side sucker n. A program that uses an intemperate
|
amount of system resource.
From the metaphorical:
|
“That application really sucks in the sides of a 4381”.
silent majority n. end users with an IQ of less than
110. Also called discretionary users.
. silver bullet 1. n. A memo or phone call from someone
.
with sufficient power to stop a section of the corporation
.
from proceeding down a wasteful or foolish path.
|
2. n. A part of a product plan (or something wishfully
|
thought to be part of a product plan) that will cure all a
|
customer’s ills. An easy, painless, magical, and costless
|
solution to an intractable opportunity (q.v.).
[Mythical]

softy
.
3. n. The metallic toggle switch in the centre bay of an
.
orange box. Like a BRS (q.v.), it restarts the system.
silver fox n. A member of the IBM Quarter Century
Club (someone who has been with IBM for 25 years or
more), or (less often) any old-timer IBM employee.
sit 1. v. To perform one’s contractual obligations, to
work.
As in: “Where do you sit?”
Primarily used at
manufacturing plants and laboratories to ask a person
where his or her office is located. Not used so often in
the field since “sit” and “work” are less likely to be
synonymous. 2. v. (Of a program) To be placed, be
found. “This Xedit macro sits on the Tools disk.”
| six sigma adj. High quality.
From statistical theory;
|
99.9999998 percent of the area under a normal curve is
|
within plus or minus six standard deviations (usually
|
designated by the greek character sigma) from the mean.
|
Allowing a reduction of 1.5 sigma for anticipated vari-
|
ation in the mean over time, one ends up with a
|
99.99966 percent coverage – approximately 3.4 defects
|
per million parts; or 3.4 failures or errors per million
|
opportunities.
Usage: “We’re aiming for a six sigma
|
product”.
skip to channel one v. To go to the top of a new
page.
This is an instruction, to a computer-controlled
printer, that had its origins in the days when printers
(such as the model 1403) had their vertical movement
stops (tabs) encoded on a wide loop of tough paper
called a carriage control tape. The carriage control tape
had a number of “channels” that could be selected to
allow a variety of forward vertical movements. Channel
one was normally reserved for “Top Of Form”.
Thus,
“Skip To Channel One” meant “skip the rest of this
page and go on to the next one”.
[Occasional excite-
ment was had when a carriage control tape, over-
tensioned, split lengthwise along the drive holes.
This
meant that the tape would no longer rotate and the
selected stop would never be found. The printer would
then dutifully spew out the rest of the box of paper at
maximum speed.] See also carriage control character.
| skunk works n. A hobby (q.v.).
sky n. A place where something is supposed to happen,
but never quite seems to.
As in: “Where the rubber
meets the sky”.
Used by business personnel to refer to
Headquarters locations, and by engineers and program-
mers to refer to the Research Division.
Usage: “Well,
now that we have developed the action strategy, let’s
take it to where the rubber meets the sky and see if
they’ll approve it.” See also road.
slash n. The solidus, the oblique character “/”.
Also
slashslash – the JCL identifier, as in:
“Slashslash
deedee splat” (// DD *).
| slide to the right n. An unplanned (though probably
|
anticipated) slip.
Derives from the usual representation
|
of a schedule, which starts on the left side of a chart
|
and ends on the right (typically with FCS).
Also used
|
as a verb: “If Fred doesn’t get his code running this
|
week, we’re going to have to slide to the right by two
|
weeks!”
slip n. An extension to a schedule deadline.
A slip
implies that the developer intends to complete the
project, but was too aggressive in his schedule.
As a
rule of thumb, if a schedule slip of one month is
announced, the project is likely to be ready after two
extra months.
slope shoulders v. To refuse to accept responsibility
(for a problem).
Problems will usually visit a number
of people suffering from sloping shoulders before even-
tually finding someone whose shoulders are square
enough (or who is naive enough) to bear the problem.
Oddly, “Square Shoulders” is not a verb in everyday
use.
slot n. A position (for a person or logic card) to be
filled.
“I have a slot for a Project Programmer.” See
also headcount.
| slugnet n. VNET (q.v.) on a slow day. [Some say on a
|
fast day, and especially in 1988.] See also notwork,
|
nyetwork.
. slush v.  To prepare a product for an IBM Software
.
Distribution tape, but with the understanding that it is
.
not the “final” final version. Slushed precedes frozen in
.
those products that have had a rocky development cycle.
.
See also cast in concrete, to-PID version.
. smoke test
n. The first power
up of a device.
.
Originally a term for the very first time that power is
.
applied to new machine.
It now applies to any power
.
up of a device after internal components have been
.
handled by the person who turns it on; e.g., turning on a
.
PC after adding an option card, memory, co-processor,
.
etc.
SMOP (smop)
n. Something quite possible, but requir-
ing unavailable resources to achieve.
“Why isn’t that
function available in the program?” – “It’s just a Simple
Matter Of Programming”.
(The implication being that,
given a few person-centuries, all things are possible.)
Also SMOUP (smoop) , a Simple Matter Of Micro-
Programming (if hand-written, using a Greek mu). See
also how hard would it be.
snail mail n. Archaic postal systems that use paper as
the medium for message transmission, rather than elec-
tronics or optics.
SneakerNet n. A high-bandwidth file transfer procedure
between PCs that are not connected electronically.
Usually implemented with a bunch of floppies and a
good pair of sneakers [soft shoes, worn in the USA].
Also called CarpetNet. See also TapeNet.
snow n. Random white dots appearing on the PC colour
display when a program does brute-force writes in the
adapter memory. Contrary to popular belief, this feature
was not provided to make compatibility with the 327x
green lighting (q.v.) possible when writing terminal
emulators for the PC.
Snow White n. IBM. See Seven Dwarves.
soapbox n. The (virtual) thing you take over when
appending to a forum (q.v.).
According to computer
conferencing traditions, you are supposed to make an
allusion to it when a) your append (q.v.) is mostly
personal beliefs with no hard facts, and b) runs to more
than 30 lines. “Excuse me, while I hoist myself up onto
the soapbox.”
social science number n. A rough estimate or statistic
based on an inadequate sample (or a guess), or a
number that is an average that does not necessarily
predict the figures that will be obtained in practice. A
figure that is usually better than nothing, but not neces-
sarily so.
Originally used by an Instructor of the
Endicott Inspection Process course.
softcopy adj. Held on a computer storage device, not
printed on paper.
software engineer 1. n. A person whose goal it is to
construct large, complex programs without actually
having to write any code. 2. n. A person who engineers
others into writing code.
software rot n. See bit decay.
softy n. An affectionate term used by engineers to
describe a software expert who knows very little about
hardware.
Software experts seem to have no affection-
ate terms for engineers.

solution 
spool
solution v. To solve.
(Probably originally from South
Road Labs, Poughkeepsie.)
“We must solution this
|
problem”.
There may be a subtle distinction here: if a
|
problem has been solved it disappears completely.
In
|
contrast, one that has been solutioned may still exist but
|
will have disappeared from formal reports.
. Some Of Our Best People Are Working On It state-
.
ment. “This is a serious problem, which we didn’t antic-
.
ipate.”
source n. The highest-level (primary source) version of
a piece of code.
The version that the author or owner
will work with when changes or enhancements are made
to the program. See also OCO.
. SP n. System Product, as in Virtual Machine/System
.
Product (VM/SP).
Although there are many different
.
System Products, only VM is known as “SP”.
As in:
.
“Are you running SP?”
. speak v. Of a computer language or software: to be
.
proficient in.
In many locations one can see signs on
.
office doors such as “APL spoken here” or, in the case
.
of one CMS bigot at the original Westlake location, “No
.
hablo MVS/TSO”.
speak to v. To talk about.
“Will you speak to these
foils, please?” See also talk to.
Speak Up!
n. An exemplary personnel programme
which allows employees to make a genuinely anony-
mous complaint to any level of management about any
IBM-related subject. Replies to Speak Up!s range from
a (quite common) positive acceptance of the complaint
and resultant change, to a (more common) patronising
brush-off which may aggravate the original feeling of
dissatisfaction.
The programme does, however, provide
a mechanism whereby employees can get the autograph
of senior members of the Corporation on personal letters
|
to them [except in IBM Israel, where the replies to
|
Speak Up!s are not signed]. See also open door.
| spearcatcher n. A person given the task of facing a
|
hostile audience (of any kind) for the purpose of giving
|
calm, reasonable answers to angry questions.
special assistant to adj. Idle.
A manager for whom
no use can be found any longer is made “Special Assist-
ant to” some higher echelon.
His activities from then
on are completely without consequence. See also staff,
ROJ.
. special-case v. To allow for a special condition in a
.
program.
“We’ll have to special-case the zero return
.
code.” Special-case can be seen as a subset of dual-path
.
(q.v.) but the latter implies that either path is equally
.
probable, while a special-cased piece of code might be
.
executed only rarely. See also fix.
. specify 1. n. An option from a set of options, one of
.
which must be chosen.
(As opposed to one from a set
.
of options, none of which need be chosen.) “The power
.
supply for this model is a specify.” 2. n. A specifica-
.
tion. “Could you look up the specify for the Model 80
.
and tell me the feature number of the pointing device?”
| specs n. The document detailing the specifications for a
|
product.
Usage: “If the specs say it should work that
|
way...” See also specify.
speculate on v. To reveal secrets about, to answer
honestly.
“Q: Why does the IBM PC Documentation
refer to an assembler, when there is none announced?” –
“A: I’m sorry, but I cannot speculate on that in public”.
spec-writer n. The person who writes the functional
specifications for a product. A product is usually speci-
fied in detail before being developed.
The specs
(Specifications) are then formally reviewed in a variety
of ways before the product is produced.
| speed, flexibility, and accuracy n. An IBM market-
|
ing slogan for its mid-20th-Century tabulating machines.
|
Unfortunately it became over-used, and in some places
|
evolved into a double entendre with a British slang
|
phrase of the period with the same abbreviation. “What
|
did you sell today? – Speed, Flexibility, Accuracy...”
|
Once this happened, an unsuccessful attempt was made
|
to re-introduce the slogan as “Speed, Accuracy, and
|
Flexibility”.
speeds and feeds n. A Marketing presentation that is
technically oriented, in contrast to the typical presenta-
tion.
This is perhaps a reference to fertiliser
descriptions; the presentation is designed to speed the
growth of a market place by feeding it with inspiring
information. Its first usage in computing, however, was
a reference to a presentation that went into details about
the printing speeds and paper feeds available with a new
printer.
A more plausible etymology suggests that it comes
from analogy with common machining jargon. “Speed”
refers to the rotational velocity of a drill or mill bit, and
“feed” to the linear velocity with which it moves into
(or across) the workpiece.
Thus to machine a piece
with the proper finish yet in minimum time, one must
calculate the proper “speeds and feeds”.
By analogy
one talked about the speeds of a processor family and
the feeds (e.g. cards per minute) of a series of input
devices.
spindle 1. n. Disk axis, and, by extension, disk unit or
disk pack.
Systems people tend to speak in term of
“spindles” since it used to be the unit of access by the
main computer.
Using the term “disk drive” can be
misleading since some IBM disk drives, like shoes, were
sold in pairs.
The issue is now further confused, since
on the 3370 and 3380 devices, there are two actuators
on each spindle; hence two addresses known to the host
computer can refer to a single set of spinning magnetic
|
disks (one spindle). 2. v. Of a card: to wrap around a
|
pin, bobbin, or finger.
A violation of the First
|
Commandment of card care and maintenance:
“Do not
|
fold, spindle, or mutilate”.
spinning chocolate n. Large, high-revenue, magnetic
disk storage devices.
A marketing term, a reference to
the brown colour of magnetic disks (which is due to
their being coated with a mixture of materials including
ferrous oxide – rust).
spin system 1. n. A version of a major control
program.
The term “Spin” was originally used by OS
developers (around 1970) in the form “spin nn” to iden-
tify a particular development level of a release prior to
its FCS. Thus “spin 11” might become the PID release
version of, say, MVT release 19. 2. n. The current
(released) version of a system.
The system that FE are
prepared to fix bugs on. (Pre-FCS systems are not spin
systems, for this usage.)
This sense probably refers to
the system that is actually spinning on the active system
disk drive. See floor system.
splat n. An Asterisk.
As in the JCL statement “// DD
*” (pronounced “slashslash deedee splat”).
See also
Nathan Hale, shriek, slash, star, *.
in sponge mode adj. Intending to listen but not
contribute to a discussion.
As in: “I’m at this meeting
in sponge mode”.
| spontaneously 
occurring 
software 
generated
|
error n. A bug.
From the excuse used by a software
|
contractor to explain the delay in the delivery of a
|
typesetting program.
spool 1. v. To move data from one disk pack to anoth-
er. From the term Spool, meaning to put data in tempo-
rary storage while awaiting delivery to its final
destination.
Usage: “Please spool that new file to me”.

Spring Plan
super
See also punch, net. “SPOOL” has become a common
verb, but originally was itself an acronym signifying
Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On Line. This acro-
nym originated with the 7070 computer, which had a
system of interrupts that let one program a peripheral
activity (e.g., card-to-tape, tape-to-print, tape-to-card)
while a main program was running. But there was no
monitor in the system, so if (for example) you
programmed an application to print out a tape while
your program was running, and there was more printing
to be done when the job had finished, either you dedi-
cated the mainframe to the print function or you could
lose the end of the print-out.
Spooling was therefore
somewhat ineffective until the advent of the System/360
with the INTRA and INTER job monitors. [Before
spooling was “perfected”, the usual procedure was to
direct all print output to a tape (tape spool?) and then
subsequently print it from the tape using a special tape-
to-print peripheral.] 2. n. The space occupied by such
buffered data.
“Did the system crash because spool
filled?”
Spring Plan n. A plan, adopted in the spring of each
year, that describes the long-term activities and business
of a location or division.
[Now known as the Strategic
Plan.] See Fall Plan.
squatterize v. To borrow or make use of an item, with-
out removing it from its original location. As in: “If the
terminal is not yet set up I will go to John and Sophie
in Pascal to squatterize a screen”.
stack n. Alternative [usually incorrect] name for a
queue.
This usage probably originated in Cambridge
(MA), at the Scientific Center there.
staff person n. A person with little responsibility but
with an amount of power directly correlated to personal
charisma. It is usually very hard to determine how seri-
ously one should deal with a staff person.
A staff
person is usually supposed to be helping the workers
accomplish their jobs but more often is asking about
something or asking for something.
Staff persons can
usually be ignored completely.
However, occasionally
someone with a great deal of charisma lands in a staff
job and carries great weight with higher management
(usually yours).
This particular breed of “staff” can be
difficult to detect, and must be treated with respect.
standard IBM keyboard n. A mythical computer input
device. The Corporate implementation of the Loch Ness
monster.
Everybody has heard about it, lots of people
talk about it, very few claim to have seen it, and none
would want to meet it. A step in its evolution is known
as the converged keyboard.
| star n. An asterisk. See *.
. star out v. To comment out lines in files in which
.
comments are indicated by a leading asterisk (star).
statement of direction 1. n. A statement describing a
commitment to a comprehensive (e.g., text processing)
strategy incorporating all current products. 2. n. A
phrase used to cover up the absence of any strategy, or
to admit a lack of foresight and planning.
steel storage substructure n. A rack.
As in the
3480 product presentation (ZV11-6107, Page 9): “The
cartridges are held in a removable 20-pack made of
polystyrene that fits into a 74-inch high by 20-inch wide
steel storage substructure (rack)”.
straight-wire v. To make a change or connection that is
transparent to a user or system. Derived from the elec-
trical engineering term used when a complicated piece
of circuitry is replaced by a simple wire.
strategic adj. Used to designate a major IBM product,
to which IBM is prepared to commit significant
resources.
A project manager will do anything to get
his or her product classified “strategic”.
strategic horizon n. The total period ahead that is
being considered for planning purposes. Nominally two
years, it is typically two months and becomes two
weeks at bad times such as just before the Spring Plan
(q.v.).
strategic plan n. See Spring Plan.
| strawman n. A plan or proposal that is unfinished or
|
not fully thought through; one that is being set up as a
|
target for others to throw spears at or knock down.
stress v. To test a piece of hardware or software by
increasing the (electronic) load on it beyond that
expected in normal use.
“Stress testing” is used to test
software with the philosophy that a heavy load is more
likely to show problems (especially windows) than a
light load. See also exercise, exerciser.
| stretch v. To work overtime.
As in: “We’ll have to
|
stretch to make that deadline”.
stretch target n. A goal that probably is impossible.
As in: “We’re setting stretch targets next year”.
. string n. A set of peripheral devices, each connected to
.
the next in line, supported by a single control unit. This
.
applies almost exclusively to DASD and tape devices.
.
See also Model A.
sub-system n. Any product which has already been
grouped (physically or on paper) with another as a
system.
Also applied to any IBM product to imply it
ought to work in conjunction with some other product;
for 
example, 
CICS 
might 
be 
described 
as 
a
“sub-system” in “a VTAM environment”.
sugar cube 1. n. A small synthetic foam sponge
parallelepiped that is used to prevent the movement of
the end of a magnetic tape, by being wedged between
the sides of the tape reel.
Usually black, but brown or
|
white in France. See also grommet. 2. n. In continental
|
Europe (where sugar cubes are often not cubes): the
|
electronic modules used on circuit cards which have a
|
whitish look due to their metal cases.
See also sardine
|
can.
. sugg (sug)
n. A suggestion.
A formal response to an
.
APAR that implies that the the APAR is accepted as a
.
suggestion and could be implemented one day; it does
.
not describe a permanent restriction.
Introduced in the
.
late 1970s.
suggestions programme n. A formal mechanism for
submitting suggestions for saving money.
Known as a
lottery whereby an employee can (by wasting IBM time
filling in a form) get cash for ideas which someone else
will have to implement.
Indeed, sometimes a whole
task force can be set up to consider the suggestion.
suitably programmed host computer n. A host
computer that might be used to support a “box” that
provides local computing power.
This phrase implies
that a) No IBM-provided software will do the job, and
b) the development group making the “box” doesn’t
know how to write the host support, but someone should
be able to work it out.
Sunny and Warm Division
n. The South-West
Marketing Division.
(Alternative expansion of the
abbreviation – a geographical truism.) See also Nasty
and Cold Division.
. sunset v. To withdraw support for a product or a range
.
of products.
Usage: “We’ll sunset that range in late
.
’89”. See also functionally stabilized.
super adj. Used in the Marketing Divisions (and possi-
bly elsewhere in the company) as a euphemism for
“Bull” and its derivatives.
“Super” is an excellent
example of dialectal and idiolectal variation within IBM.
Its meanings vary from “Wonderful” to “Rubbish” via
incredible (normal or alternative meaning (q.v.)) depend-

supervisor state
tattooed
ing on cultural sub-group. Alternative terms with proba-
bly the same meanings include“Fantastic”, “Horse
Apples”, etc.
supervisor state n. See problem state.
supplication language n. See command language.
surface v. To raise, or bring to someone’s attention.
“We should surface that issue at the next staff meeting.”
Susie Cobol n. A programmer straight out of training
school who knows everything – except the benefits of
comments in (plain) English.
Also (fashionable among
personkind these days to avoid accusations of being
sexist) Sammy Cobol.
. SVC13 v. To create a dump; to create waste.
From the
.
identifier of an OS supervisor call (SVC) instruction.
.
SVCs are used to communicate between user address
.
spaces and the system supervisor, including hardware
.
facilities.
Each SVC function (load, attach task, etc.)
.
has a specific identifier, 13 being used to terminate a
.
failing address space with a dump. See also brain dump.
. symbol n. A sequence of characters that forms a
.
symbolic code for some other sequence.
Originally
.
provided in text formatters so that common phrases or
.
uncommon characters could be represented by a more
.
convenient sequence, symbols are now used in more
.
general communication.
By convention (from various
.
macro processors and languages) symbols start with the
.
& character (q.v.) – hence one might see “&deity”
.
appear in a discussion, with the implication that one
.
should insert the deity of one’s choice at this point.
SYNTAX ERROR 1. n. An unidentified error.
A
general message put out by compilers and interpreters
when a) the error was never expected to occur; or b) the
programmer got tired of dreaming up new error
messages for trivial cases; or c) the compiler failed, but
it was easy to blame the error on the user. 2. n. An
expletive used to cover a speaker’s embarrassment after
making a gaffe. “Oops! Syntax error!”
sysprog n. Systems Programmer.
An affectionate term
for the systems programmer responsible for a depart-
ment or small location. This person is expected to be a
hardware and software expert, to have infinite patience
when dealing with ordering procedures, security require-
ments, and users, and of course to control enormous
computing resources.
Usage: “My sysprog always
grumbles if I ask for more than 100 Meg of disk storage
at a time”.
system n. A word appended to the description of any
group of two or more modules or products which are
announced or developed together.
The intention is to
give an impression that the products result from a care-
ful and unified design process.
For example, “3270
Information Display System” may give some people a
feeling of assurance that the 3278 keyboard really was
carefully designed for use under the VM operating
system. See also sub-system.
tablature n. The tables in a document.
Usually has
nothing to do with the true meanings of the word, which
include “stone tablet”, “musical notation”, and “work of
art”.
tailgate v. To go through a badge-controlled access door
without using your own badge.
This is done either
because you were able to catch the door before it
closed, or because the person in front of you was nice
enough to hold the door open for you. Even if there is
no physical door, as in a main lobby, to pass the badge
reader without inserting your badge is considered
tailgating. A heinous action.
take n. A position in a discussion or argument.
As in:
“My take on this is that it’s unimportant”.
talk to 1. v. To discuss. “I will talk to that detail later”.
Usually means that the speaker hopes his audience will
drop the subject. See also speak to. 2. v. To communi-
cate with another (usually of machines).
For example,
“These machines talk to each other, but do they under-
stand?
Is one talking French and the other listening in
German?
(While an English-speaking security person
eavesdrops?)” See also speak to.
. tall card n. A PC expansion card or adapter that will
.
only fit in the PC/AT.
The PC/AT box, being higher
.
than earlier varieties, accepts “taller” cards.
See also
.
short card.
Tandem Memos n. Something constructive but hard to
control; a fresh of breath air (sic).
“That’s another
Tandem Memos.”
A phrase to worry middle manage-
ment. It refers to the computer-based conference (wide-
ly distributed in 1981) in which many technical
personnel expressed dissatisfaction with the tools avail-
able to them at that time, and also constructively
criticised the way products were [are] developed.
The
memos are required reading for anyone with a serious
interest in quality products.
tanstaafl (tan-stah-fil)
n. There Ain’t No Such Thing
As A Free Lunch. From Robert Heinlein’s The Moon is
a Harsh Mistress. Used to explain pricing policies to a
customer – a fashionable way to say “You pays your
money and makes your choice”. It may also remind the
customer that he, in the end, pays for the extended
lunches that marketing representatives (from any compa-
ny) “treat” him to. See also pay for the coffee.
. TapeNet n. A very high-bandwidth file transfer proce-
.
dure between mainframes that are not connected elec-
.
tronically (e.g., because of a network failure). Files are
.
written to tape, taken by courier to the destination
.
system, then re-loaded there. See also SneakerNet.
target 1. n. A goal (usually a date) toward which the
members of a project work. 2. v. To aim to complete
by.
“Let’s target this decision for November” 3. n. A
termination flag (again, usually a date) arbitrarily affixed
to the end of a project. See slip.
target date n. A date by which a given event must
occur.
“Let’s set a target date” actually means “Let us
agree on a date at which, if the event has not yet
occurred, we’ll start looking for someone or something
to blame”.
task force 1. n. A high-powered group of experts
appointed to solve some problem of pressing urgency.
[Official Definition.] 2. n. A useful place for manage-
ment to hide people who have nothing better to do than
natter on about things. [Note: It is said that task forces
have occasionally produced (useful) results.
There
exists little evidence to support this hypothesis.] 3. n. A
group of friends and one or two experts gathered to
again affirm the predefined conclusions of the leader.
The gathering can be convivial fun or a crashing bore.
The activity may benefit the leader’s CYA position. See
also secretary of task forces.
. TAT (tat)
v. To test the Turn-Around Time of a confer-
.
encing facility.
This is done by sending an append to a
.
test forum (usually called TESTER) on the master and
.
seeing when it is echoed back to the local shadow. This
.
can help one determine whether shadow inactivity is due
.
to an idle master or to a broken network link.

folklore, long-term IBMers have their IBM badge
.
tattooed on their chests.

technical vitality
time-frame, timeframe
technical vitality
n. Visible use of leading-edge
(advanced) technology.
This is interpreted in some
development labs as “using recent vendor technology”.
This phrase is also used at a lower level as an excuse to
hire new personnel or order new machines.
“Manager
of Technical Vitality” can be a penalty box assignment.
technology n. Some particular flavour of silicon manu-
facturing process.
“We can’t put the whole channel on
one chip until we go to the next technology.”
TechRef n. The IBM PC Technical Reference Manual
(TRM). The TechRef is the only PC documentation that
will be read by self-proclaimed “real” PC programmers.
temporary assignment n. permanent move. (q.v.)
temporary 
building
n. A 
prefabricated 
building
intended as temporary office space.
Temporary
buildings usually have a life span that far exceeds that
of more permanent structures.
This is an international
constant in IBM – some of Hursley’s 5-year temporary
buildings are still standing after 18 years. See temporary
assignment, module.
tenant n. A person that works at a location, but not for
the division that runs the location.
Often treated as a
“second-class” citizen in any consideration of space,
services, or resource.
. tent card n. A rectangular card, folded down the middle
.
lengthwise, on which a name is written to identify a
.
participant in a meeting.
. terminal n. A device (usually consisting of a display
.
screen, keyboard, and other hardware) that is at the end
.
of the chain of hardware, systems, and interfaces
.
between a program and its user.
The term is generic;
.
many terminals nowadays are simply PC’s running
.
terminal emulation software (which may be all that
.
they run).
The term is best avoided by salespeople
.
working in the medical sector.
terminate v. To release someone from IBM employ-
ment. This deadly verb is used to describe the action of
losing an employee.
“He [his employment] will be
terminated.” Rumour has it that (ex-) employees do
survive this process, if not from the point of view of
IBM. Interestingly, even loyal employees are terminated
should they happen to transfer between IBM companies.
test 1. v. In a good development laboratory, to allow
real users to use a product for a significant amount of
time before announcement. 2. v. In a bad development
laboratory, to get a few bored or unmotivated people to
try one or two of the things mentioned in the product
specification.
That is, to try the things the developers
had already considered.
test bucket n. A set of test cases to run against a prod-
uct during development to check that it performs basic
functions correctly.
“You must run the test bucket
against all code changes.”
This term implies (always
incorrectly) that the set of test cases is complete and
provides a full functional verification of the product,
encompassing all possible combinations of input, output,
timings, and error conditions. See also bucket, regression
bucket.
text 1. n. Executable code, usually with addresses unre-
solved (known sometimes as object code).
“The
compiler produces one text deck for each source file”.
2. n. Textual (documental) material. Data which are in
ordinary ASCII or EBCDIC representation.
“Those are
text files, you can review them using the editor”.
. thank you n. “End of message.” Used by many comput-
.
er centres as a secular alternative to Amen:
“All
.
systems will be going down in one minute.
Thank
.
you.”
thesis n. See paren.
THINK (ponder) 1. v. Think. Perhaps the most famous
IBM slogan.
This was originally used by the first Mr.
Watson, around 1900, to convey the idea of complete
staff work.
That is, given a problem or a challenge,
time should be taken to reason the problem through and
cover all involved aspects carefully, and to consider all
repercussions and (of course) all financial consider-
ations. This is not unlike the more recent “Make Sure”
and do it right the first time (q.v.) slogans now used with-
in the Quality Program.
“Think” is also the name of the in-house magazine
distributed to all IBM employees in the USA (but
considered too syrupy for the more cosmopolitan tastes
in the other half of IBM).
2. n. (Meaning unknown.)
A well-established IBM acronym which is so well-
established that no one can remember what it originally
meant.
Said to exemplify an ideal that cannot be
achieved.
think small v. To reduce problems to a series of smaller
problems.
A hardware or software test strategy; the
technique being to exercise the most primitive functions
first to prove to yourself that they work, before trying
the more complex (and presumably failing) tasks. When
people forget this basic strategy, they are gently
reminded to “think small”.
thin-slicing baloney n. Hair splitting, but starting from
an indefensible and absurd position.
. thought v. The slogan of the IBM retirees club in
.
Auckland, New Zealand. See THINK.
thrash v. To think very hard but not accomplish much.
“John needs some help on this problem – he’s
thrashing.” Refers to the computer malaise in which the
system uses more time organising the resources avail-
able than it gives to the users.
three-handed keyboard n. A 3278 or 3279 keyboard
with the APL feature.
three-tree report n. A very large, fat, report printed on
a 3800 or other fast computer printer.
Variants include
Five-Tree and Seven-Tree Reports.
See also kill a tree,
sequoia.
through v. To pass on to, or work through. As in: “I do
not wish to through activities to another group which
may create user dissatisfaction by decreasing support
level”.
throughput n. Any measure of the processing power of
a computer, in terms of the number of pieces of work in
some unit of time.
“The new model has twice the
throughput of the old.” See also MIPS.
TIE system n. Technical Information Exchange system.
A computerised Bulletin Board system, as might be
operated by a PC Club.
Since the essence of such a
system is the public exchange of information by the
subscribers, and since posting information on (or to)
anything called a “bulletin board” is a management
prerogative, a different name had to be found.
| time delay n. Delay.
[What other kind of delay is
|
there?]
time-frame, timeframe n. A range of dates during
which an event will occur. When used in a question, its
intent is to elicit a target date (q.v.) without seeming to
be too aggressive, as in: “What sort of time-frame are
we talking about?” Can also be used in a response:
“We’re looking at a July time-frame for completion”.
An important usage note: the date when used in a
response always means the earliest possible date to the
questioner (1 July, in the example above) and the latest
date to the responder (31 July).

TIME 
LIFE
TIME/LIFE n. The legendary (defunct since 1975) New
York Programming Center, formerly in the TIME &
LIFE Building on 6th Avenue, near the Rockefeller
Center, in New York City.
For many years it was the
home of System/360 and System/370 Languages, Sorts
and Utilities.
Its programmers are now primarily in
Kingston, Palo Alto, and Santa Teresa (or retired).
. time-stamp, timestamp 1. n. An annotation to either
.
paper documents or electronic data that indicates the
.
time and/or date of some (often undefined) happening.
.
The accuracy of a time-stamp seems to be directly
.
proportional to the obscurity of the units in which it is
.
expressed. For example, the date on a buck slip is often
.
unrelated to the document to which it is attached, even
.
though it is almost always written in an easily under-
.
stood form.
On the other hand, MVS allows one to
.
determine a time of day as a count of 26.04166 micro-
.
second timer units since midnight, and provides the
.
difference between local time and Greenwich Mean
.
Time in units of 1.048576 seconds. 2. v. To mark with
.
a time-stamp.
tip of the ice cube n. The visible part of something
very small and insignificant.
“That task force report is
just the tip of the ice cube”.
tired iron n. Data processing equipment that is perfectly
functional (because most of the bugs have been fixed)
but has been superseded by a new line of devices.
| TLA n. Three Letter Abbreviation. A four-letter abbrevi-
|
ation is, of course, an XTLA (eXtended Three Letter
|
Abbreviation). See also acronym.
TNL 1. n. Technical Newsletter.
Replacement pages
containing miscellaneous technical changes to an exist-
ing IBM manual, often published between editions or
releases. Considered to be synonymous with the phrase,
“We forgot to tell you about this,” or “This is how it
really works”.
The TNL’s binding, size, and three-ring
binder holes must be just slightly different from those of
the base manual. 2. v. To publish or issue a technical
newsletter.
As in: “We can always TNL it later”. See
also fix it in pubs.
-to suffix. Used to make an ungrammatical sentence
slightly more or less grammatical, according to the
whim of the user.
This can be used with almost any
verb, as in: “We can’t exit Phase 0 without an agreed-to
IBP”.
toeprint n. A footprint (q.v.) of especially small size.
token n. An 8-character alphanumeric operand.
This
size was chosen because it just happened to fit the size
of one of the System/360 atomic units of storage (the
doubleword).
Some operating systems and programs
used to (and often still do) insist on parsing all input
and truncating any words longer than 8 characters.
[Especially annoying to those with 9-letter surnames.]
See also how hard would it be.
token ring n. A local area network architecture in which
computers are connected to a ring of wires or fibres
around which messages (authorised by a token – rather
like a relay baton) are passed; a possible physical layer
for SNA or OSI.
Not to be confused with the Tolkien
Ring, although the purposes are similar: “One ring to
rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring
them all and in the darkness bind them, In a LAN with
more nodes where the stations lie.”
. tolerant adj. Of a program: able to tolerate a certain
.
system environment without crashing.
By implication
.
the program will run, but may have limitations or may
.
not be able to take full advantage of the environment.
.
“Yes, it’ll run under XA, in toleration mode.”
| TOOLS disk n. A disk of shared data (especially of
|
programs or computer conferences) that is maintained
|
automatically 
by 
the 
TOOLS 
and 
TOOLSRUN
|
programs. TOOLS was created in 1981, and now main-
|
tains tens of thousands of disks of data in IBM, mostly
|
shared and copied across VNET (q.v.).
. toolsmith n. One whose delight is the creation of tools.
.
“Tool” here refers to any program (software) that helps
.
people – preferably many people – do what they want to
.
do as easily and as pleasantly as possible.
to-PID version (phonetic beheading of stupid)  1. n. A
version of a software product made available to internal
users by the development group, which is supposedly a
copy of the distribution tape prepared and shipped to
PID (q.v.).
This is rarely the same as the tape sent to
customers, since developers often send more than one
tape to PID at different times. See also golden diskette.
2. n. An unreadable tape. This usage refers to the prac-
tice (pioneered, it is said, by CPD Raleigh) of sending
an unreadable tape to PID when the software isn’t ready
yet.
By the time PID discovers the “mistake”, the real
version will be ready (or so it is hoped).
topside n. The higher management echelons of a project
or group.
“To go in topside with a problem” means to
attack the problem from top management downwards.
. tortoise-and-hare problem n. The problem that arises
.
when a recent version of a file (or an update) sent over
.
the network overtakes an older version of the same file,
.
due to difference in size or network routing.
This,
.
unless precautions are taken, usually results in a back-
.
level version for the recipient (often a service machine
.
or conferencing facility).
The same problem can affect
.
users directly when pieces of electronic mail arrive in
.
the wrong order – sometimes leading to costly errors.
touch base with v. To talk about something to some-
one who would expect to be informed.
Usage: “I shall
go touch base with management about that problem”.
This term is understood to be a loan word from the
language associated with a tribal ritual called “baseball”.
tourist information n. Additional interesting but irrel-
evant information given in a presentation. For example:
“Status: Customer running with no problems.
TSO
response time 11 minutes. Transaction rate 11.1397 per
second”.
The second and third sentences are tourist
information if the subject of the presentation is system
availability. This is probably derived from tourist guide
books or maps that not only provide information about
getting from place to place, but also give a collection of
other information about each place.
. tower n. An extension to a library, or suite, of programs
.
that is built upon a previously available lower level
.
“base” or “platform” of programs.
This type of exten-
.
sion is in contrast to extensions made by modifying the
.
base, and often leads to structurally sound systems –
.
provided the base is stable enough.
The term is used
.
most often by those for whom it is a novel idea. See
.
also application tower.
| Tower C, Tour C n. The cafe/bar opposite the entrances
|
of Towers A and B of the European Headquarters in
|
Paris.
Usage: “Confidential matters will not be
|
discussed at Tower C”. It is reported that, when it first
|
opened, Tower C did very poor business in the early
|
evening until curtains were installed so that homeward-
|
bound executives couldn’t see who was inside.
toy 1. n. A program that can be readily understood.
2. n. A project in which the writing of the code is a
significant part of the effort. In a “real” project, coding
is a negligible portion of the costs. 3. adj. Of a tool:
great for teaching but lacking the basic facilities needed
for doing real work.
The classic example in computer
languages is Pascal. See also Mickey Mouse.

tradeoff document
type one
. tradeoff document n. A paper describing the pros,
.
cons, and assumptions that were used in arriving at a
.
decision. Usually written after the fact, and therefore “a
.
list of reasons why we did what we did and why we
.
didn’t do what we didn’t do”.
trailing-edge adj. Slow to change (cf. leading-edge).
Used in marketing to denote an account who are not
interested in SNA, MVS, PROFS, etc.
Usage: “XYZ
are a real trailing edge account”.
(Note that “account”
describes people in this usage, hence the plural is
correct.)
translucent 1. adj. Of a change: claimed to affect a
user or system very slightly.
Used when a claim of
transparency (q.v.) is obviously untenable. 2. adj. Of a
change: requiring a huge effort to accommodate.
transparent 1. adj. Of a change: claimed to have no
adverse effects on a user or system. Used when talking
to change control to clinch an argument. “But it’s trans-
parent!”
Sadly, transparency seems a relative thing
[relatively rare] – after all, if truly transparent, why
make the change? See also seamless. 2. v. to go
transparent. To avoid responsibility for something by
providing no solid place on which blame can be rested.
As in: “When they found out that a GPD person caused
the problem, they went transparent on it”.
| trap D v. Of a program running under the OS/2 operat-
|
ing system: to crash. From the identifier, the number 13
|
in hexadecimal, of the interrupt (and its handler, or trap)
|
raised when a program tries to access a resource, such
|
as storage, which it does not own. Usage: “Whenever I
|
run your program from diskette it trap Ds”.
. trawl v. To find out, by sending out large numbers of
.
automatic requests, what information is available from
.
newly set-up service machines; to look for new service
.
machines.
trick 1. n. A piece of code, or a programming algorithm,
that cannot be understood by a newly trained program-
mer.
The term is used during programming phase
reviews: “The use of the translate function to reverse the
string is a neat trick, but it can be made clearer and
more understandable by the use of a DO loop”.
2. n. On an engineering model, a quick design change
made to flatten a bug. If good, it will eventually go into
the official design.
If bad (the bug is still there, or
another bug appears) then another trick will be tried.
trickological adj. Written more to glorify the tricks than
to get the function performed.
A trickological program
of the highest order can be comprehended only by its
author.
It is especially easy (indeed, almost trivial) to
write one of these in APL.
Perhaps a pun on
“trichological” [referring to the study of hair or
hairiness]?
tri-lead n. A wire that consists of a central conductor
with an earth (ground) wire each side.
Effective as a
signal carrier, but the contacts have been known to be
less than ideal – so it is just as well that the number of
wires in central processors is actually going down with
complexity, rather than increasing.
If the bad
connection happened to be the ground wire (which was
only connected to ground at one end) then the resulting
floating conductor acted as a marvellous antenna; the
noise it picked up was then efficiently coupled to the
signal wires.
tri-lead trichinosis n. A condition in which the silver
signal (centre) conductor of a Tri-lead causes a short-
circuit between that conductor and one or both of the
adjacent ground conductors due to chemical migration.
Nothing to do with the worm infestation resulting from
the eating of infected and insufficiently cooked pork,
and in no way a religious statement.
trivial 1. adj. Possible.
Used to convey the impression
that the speaker is an expert in a subject and that the
method of solution should be immediately obvious to
everyone else in the room. Normally used when no one
in the room (including the speaker) can think of a
.
solution. 2. adj. Of passwords: predictable.
As in:
.
“Your 
husband’s 
name 
is 
a 
trivial 
password”.
3. adj. Easy. This usage implies that if the speaker had
the responsibility of carrying out the task, it would be
done in a matter of minutes.
But, alas, it is someone
else’s job. 4. adj. non-trivial.
Too long, or simply
uninteresting, so that the speaker does not really want to
do it. “That’s a non-trivial change”.
Trouble Came Back, TCB n. A problem that has
failed to succumb to its solution.
This colloquialism is
used by maintenance people to describe an intermittent
or difficult-to-reproduce problem which has failed to
respond to neglect. See no problem found, go away.
true blue adj. Of a customer account: using only IBM
equipment. See also all-blue.
. tube 1. n. A display screen.
2. v. To send for display.
.
“Can you tube me that ADMGDF file?”
tube-jockey n. A person who spends all of his or her
working time (that is, time not spent at a coffee
machine) pushing buttons on a keyboard without any
noticeable results.
This is the modern version of “a
paper-pusher”.
The most visible kind spend all day
appending 
to 
non-technical
forums, 
and 
can 
be
recognised by their compulsion to sign every append
with self-bestowed titles showing how clever they are.
Tuesday n. The Day of the Announcement. For various
reasons, most (if not all) IBM Domestic products are
announced on a Tuesday. [It is said that this originally
came to pass because T. J. Watson went sailing at
weekends, and could not be sure of returning on a
Monday if winds should fail him.] The major exception
to this rule occurs when April Fool’s Day is a Tuesday
(as in 1986), in which case announcements are delayed
until the Wednesday – 2nd April.
turbo adj. Of a revised program: better, faster, and
bigger.
This term is a spin-off from the automobile
industry, though of course before it can be used in a
computing environment it has to be acronymised.
The
most interesting acronym so far is TURBO: The Ulti-
mate Really Better Overall. This was used to describe a
non-strategic project at Yorktown that aimed to develop
an improved CMS.
tweak v. To change in a small way, to tune.
May be
applied to software or to hardware. See also one-line fix.
twenty-pounder n. A particularly brassy form of wing-
tipped shoe.
As in: “There he was, all dressed out in
his power suit and twenty-pounders”.
twin-tail n. A method for connecting an IBM communi-
cations controller to two different computers so that they
share access to a common communications network, or
to connect two BSC lines to work like a single full-
duplex line.
Carries all the usual human problems and
implications of trying to serve two masters.
(From the
electronics term for a balanced two-transistor – often
FET – amplifier, “twin-tailed pair”.)
type one adj. Of software: fully supported, as for
System Products.
This term refers to one of the old
IBM software service agreement levels of support. The
term has come to mean “high quality” software, though
(since much of it is very old) it is not necessarily up to
today’s standards.
[This author has campaigned for
some time for “Type Zero” code – software that is guar-
anteed correct and reliable.] See also home-grown.

Tyranosaure 
vehicle
Tyranosaure n. REXX, when used in France.
T3 n. Teach The Teachers time.
The beginning of the
spreading of the marketing information for a product
which typically occurs about a week before a product’s
announcement.
. UKUS 
(yuke-us,
you-kay-you-ess)
adj. Of
syntax,
.
pronunciation, 
punctuation, 
or 
spelling: 
differing
.
between UK and US (British and American) English.
.
Usage: “That flavour of ‘flavor’ is ukus.”
umbrella PTF n. A PTF (q.v.) that contains fixes to
several (related and inter-dependent) products.
Almost
always a nightmare for users, because the complexity of
the change means that human error will prevail, some-
thing will get overlooked, and something will break
after the PTF has been applied.
| uncork 1. v. To bring a problem to public view. As in:
|
“Who uncorked that mess?” 2. v. To lose one’s temper.
|
As in: “He really uncorked when he found out what it
|
was going to cost.” See also come out of the bottle.
. undercover micro n. A microprocessor whose presence
.
is neither documented nor obvious to the user of the
.
hardware in which it is contained.
unit n. By U.S. law, something that can be purchased
separately.
Note that for this reason, IBM (and other
computer manufacturers) no longer make CPUs (Central
Processing Units), but CPs (Central Processors).
up adj. Working normally. The opposite of down (q.v.).
“Is the system up yet?”
update n. A change to a piece of software or hardware
made in order to enhance its capabilities or to correct a
problem. Often refers to a particular portion of software
(the delta) that can be merged automatically with the
source of a program (if you have it) to form a new,
updated, version. “Can you send me the update that lets
it work with RSCS Version 2?” See also OCO.
UP-genned (you-pee-genned)
adj. Of a system: gener-
ated to use only one processor of a multi-processor
hardware complex.
Often a “trick” that simplifies the
work of the sysprog, who then hopes that no one notices
that the system is not running as fast as it might do.
[Usually applied to avoid software that simply does not
work on multi-processors.]
Also used to describe a
person who can only deal with a single problem at a
time.
. uplevel v. To install a more recent version of a program
.
(not necessarily the most up-to-date).
“When are you
.
planning to uplevel RSCS?”
uplift n. An increment.
Commonly used in pricing
discussions.
It has nothing to do with emotional or
moral effects.
Usage: “If we vendorize that unit, what
will be the uplift on the price tag?”
. user n. One who uses (rather than creates) a product.
user-cuddly adj. Of software or documentation: espe-
cially user-friendly.
[This phrase was first heard from a
customer at the SHARE conference in March 1984,
describing the VM REXX interpreter.]
user error 1. n. Documentation error.
2. n. Poor
|
design.
3. n. (rare)
A mistake made by a user.
As
|
used in the MVS/XA System Programming Library:
|
“Because user errors often produce unpredictable results,
|
the user should try to avoid them.”
user exit n. A published external interface that allows
access to the internals of a piece of software.
user-friendly 1. adj. Of a program: usable by someone
who is not a computer expert. A program that was used
by more than twenty people (whose comments were
acted upon) before being distributed. 2. n. Of hardware
or software: not easy to use, but needing to be sold. See
also user-cuddly, user-hostile.
. user-hostile adj. Of a program: actively unpleasant to
.
the user; not user-friendly.
Often due to the use of ill-
.
chosen words for messages, as when the user mistypes a
.
command, and the program responds, brusquely,
.
“Illegal Command” [Go Directly To Jail].
userid
(you-zer-eye-dee) 
1. n. “nom
de
terminal”.
2. n. A nickname that identifies a person (user) to a
computer system or to other users.
It is most under-
standable if selected by the user (and in this case may
even be related to the name of the user). If selected by
a program written by someone with a tiny mind, it is
likely to be cryptic (KR39232E, 86612345).
A strange
rule was used in the La Gaude laboratory until recently;
one could have any userid one wanted so long as it
|
began with the letter “L”. Yorktown Research once had
|
a more involved rule: you could have any userid you
|
liked, provided it was no more than seven letters, and
|
did not begin with the letters “IBM” (or any other string
|
that already existed as a userid).
[History can cause
.
strange anomalies: “IBMPC” was allowed, “IBMVM”
.
was not.] See also nodeid, vnetid.
user orientation n. A term for the kind of manual now
described as user friendly. This was first used in 1968 at
a meeting of hardware publications managers, when it
was stated that the greatest need was for publications
developers to understand who the readers were and why
they were readers. It took fifteen years for this truth to
be widely appreciated and applied.
. utility n. A program that provides a general service that
.
may have a variety of uses.
For example, sorting and
.
printing programs are often called utilities.
The name
.
implies a lack of novelty, and describes a “bread-and-
.
butter” program. See also facility.
| value add n. An improvement in function or perform-
|
ance.
“What’s the value add in release 3?” See added
|
value.
vanilla adj. Of standard flavour, e.g., as shipped to
customers.
As in: “You mean it’s possible to run
vanilla CP?” See also chocolate, mocha, flavour,and PID.
vaporware n. Hardware or software that is announced
[not by IBM!] for availability at a later date, but never
materializes.
In the case of PC-related products, this is
often because the announcing company itself has
vaporized.
| vary v. To change a device from online to offline, or vice
|
versa, usually while the computer it is attached to
|
continues to operate.
From the OS command VARY,
|
still available on VM and MVS systems.
As in: “We’ll
|
vary that CPU on and see if we can come up MP”.
. Vector Feature, Vector Facility n. An optional vector
.
processor that can be added to an IBM 3090 mainframe.
|
The Vector Feature, developed at the Poughkeepsie
|
Laboratory, is remarkable for being a major hardware
|
product that was developed entirely “on the sly” – so
|
much so that it’s said that not even IBM’s competitors
|
knew about it. See hobby.
vector processor n. Any machine with a non-370
compatible architecture that runs at a speed of over 3
MIPS.
There is an implicit slight here that it is not a
real “commercial” machine, since vector processors typi-
cally are used for scientific applications.
Presumably
(so it is thought) when a “vector processor” is given a
commercial job stream, it will not run any faster than
the fastest 370.
[Attitudes to vector processors have
changed dramatically since the announcement of the
3090 Vector product in 1985.] See minicomputer.
vehicle n. An indirect means to achieve some result
(usually in the marketplace).
“We will focus on the F
machines as the key vehicle for the new user interface.”

vendor 
VMSHARE
vendor 1. n. A company that either supplies a product
or service to IBM, or supplies something to IBM
customers.
See also OEM. 2. v. To release headcount
(to comply with cuts or to supply a new project) by
employing contract labour to carry out maintenance
and/or development on a project.
Despite the observa-
tion that even more people (including contractor person-
nel) are now involved with the project (since IBM must
still perform planning and contract supervision) this is
viewed as a wise use of resources.
vendorable adj. Allowed to be vended out.
Usually
heard as “Not Vendorable”.
vendorize v. To hire a sub-contractor (vendor) to do
something that was previously done in-house.
A
vendorized product is one that was originally built by
IBM but is now largely assembled by a sub-contractor.
vendor 
technology
n. Semiconductor
technology
produced outside IBM. The implication is that any vari-
ety of technology can be produced by IBM, but “out
there” they can raise only one type. Vendor Technology
Logic (VTL) was synonymous with TTL (Transistor-
Transistor Logic, never manufactured by IBM) in the
1970s.
vend out v. To contract production of some item to an
outside vendor.
A favourite way to avoid security
restrictions – quite recently the contract for making the
foils for a presentation to the Corporate Management
Committee to summarise the IBM corporate five-year
plan was vended out.
verb n. Any word (i.e., any noun may be misused as a
verb). “There is no noun in the American language that
cannot be verbed”.
verbiage (ver-bij, ver-bedge)
n. A term used to refer to
any kind of documentation. The similarity of this word
to “garbage” does not seem accidental, and the word is
often misspelt as “Verbage”.
The use of this term has
the effect of belittling the documentation, either because
one wants to under-emphasise its importance, as in “I
have the design flowchart all done. All I have to do is
add the verbiage”, or because the documentation is
wordy, as in: “That user’s manual sure has a lot of
verbiage in it”, or because the reader is too “busy” to be
bothered to read it.
. vertical adj. Specialised (rather than broad-based, or
.
horizontal).
As in: “...some of the more specialised
.
micro dealers are starting to find themselves up a pretty
.
tight vertical niche.”
via n. A pathway from one face of a printed circuit card
(or layer in a chip) to the other.
Originally always
described the plated-through holes in IBM multi-layer
printed circuit cards (a scarce resource), but now more
loosely applied to hardware mechanisms for taking a
short-cut from one place to another, or to any
construction method that can take advantage of vias.
vibration tested adj. Having survived careless or delib-
erate mechanical abuse, such as being dropped or
kicked.
[Such treatment cures faults in equipment
almost as often as it causes them.]
virgin adj. Of a program: unmodified (e.g., as received
from PID). It is interesting to note that the first modifi-
cation to such code is usually that which is the most
desired.
Also used to describe a silicon wafer before
the first etching to place transistors or other components
on it; a tape or paper before first impression; etc. See
also vanilla.
virtual adj. A term used to indicate that things are not
what they seem to be.
Generally means that you can
see it, but it is not really there.
As in virtual disk,
virtual memory.
(As opposed to something that is
transparent: “It’s really there, but you can’t see it”.)
virtual Friday n. The Wednesday or Thursday before a
long weekend in the USA for which the Thursday or
Friday (respectively) is a holiday.
Usage: “Don’t hold
that meeting tomorrow afternoon – it’s a virtual Friday”.
| virtualize v. Under VM, to simulate a resource for a
|
virtual machine.
“VM/XA SP virtualizes central
|
processors and central storage but not expanded
|
storage.”
In other words, VM/XA SP can simulate
|
processors and central storage for an operating system
|
running under it, but cannot simulate expanded storage.
virtual machine n. See VM.
visibility n. Kudos, importance.
A project that has
“visibility” is much in the eye of others. This makes it
high (political) risk; the workers involved may find
themselves showered with awards – or may find them-
selves the scapegoats for others.
visionary n. Someone who reads the outside literature.
visual footprint n. The apparent size of a piece of
computer equipment – such as a terminal – as perceived
by a user. For example, many televisions have acres of
wasted space each side of the screen; others, with a
smaller visual footprint, generally look more elegant.
vital records n. Records which are supposed to allow a
project to restart with minimal loss in the event of disas-
ter. As they are usually three to six months out of date,
and often suffering from inconsistency, it is just as well
that they have never really been needed.
VM n. Virtual Machine. Used universally within IBM to
refer to the VM/370 Operating System, now known as
VM/SP (Virtual Machine System Product).
VM is the
most general IBM operating system for the System/370,
since it alone allows all the other operating systems to
be run under it (including itself).
It is the operating
system of choice within IBM for almost all development
work, since its single-user Conversational Monitor
System (CMS) is faster and more adaptable than the
alternatives. See also SP.
VMITE (vee-might)
n. VM Internal Technical Exchange.
A gathering of many of the IBM VM System Program-
|
mers, held for ten years in or near San Jose.
With the
|
steadily increasing number of VM systems, this meeting
|
maintained its vitality in a way unusual for this kind of
|
regular conference from its first meeting in 1978 until it
|
was superseded by the CCITE (q.v.) in 1989. The meet-
|
ing was originally organized and hosted by Ray
|
Holland, then of the General Products Division VM
|
System Support group at the Santa Teresa Lab.
It was
|
first held at the San Jose Research Laboratory, then later
|
at the San Jose Convention Center, and finally at the
|
Almaden Research Center.
VMNews (vee-em-news)
v. To submit an item to the
VM Newsletter.
The VM Newsletter, edited by Peter
Capek, ran for 50 editions in the late 1970s and early
1980s and was certainly the most useful communication
newsletter within IBM, its usefulness only later being
eclipsed by the growth of conferencing systems. There-
fore to VMNews a piece of information is to ensure its
wide distribution.
A different meaning sometimes
occurs to the select group of enthusiasts who submitted
items to the 51st edition.
VMR v. To reject. From Very Much Regret, the wording
used in the standard rejection letter for PC Software
Submissions “I think we should VMR this one”.
. VMSHARE n. A conferencing system used by the VM
.
project of the SHARE organisation (a user’s group of
.
IBM customers). A copy of the conference is provided
.
by SHARE for IBM use; there is also a later PCSHARE
.
conference.

VNET
whim of record
VNET (vee-net)
v. To send by computer network (as
opposed to tape or mail).
“I’ll VNET you the files
tomorrow”.
The verb derives from the name of the
original IBM communication network set up within IBM
during the 1970s, and now linking over 2600 computers.
The V, incidentally, means nothing – the name was
chosen to resemble the other familiar acronyms of the
time (VSAM, VTAM, and so on). VNET is sometimes
described as “a communication network for Service
Machines, which humans are sometimes able to use”.
See also net.
vnetid (vee-net-eye-dee)
n. The network address of a
computer user or service machine.
It is usually the
combination of an untypeable nodeid (q.v.) with a
cryptic userid (q.v.).
This often makes the identity of
the originator of a message very difficult to determine if
no real name is included in the message. How is one to
guess that XES7208C at GYSVMHD1 is good ol’ Kurt
in Heidelberg? Sometimes the only way to answer is to
begin with “Dear XES7208C at GYSVMHD1..”.
| wait state n. A period during which a processor is idle,
|
for example, waiting for input, output, or memory activ-
|
ity to complete.
Rare in modern multitasking systems,
|
but common on workstations and personal computers
|
even today.
System/360s had a wait light which indi-
|
cated that the processor was in wait state; it’s said that
|
some engineers replaced this with a burnt-out bulb to
|
avoid drawing attention to this implied inefficiency.
walk around the block v. To convince someone to do
something by repeated requests and explanations, some-
times by higher and higher levels of management. “He
didn’t want to take the assignment, but we walked
around the block a few times and he saw the light”.
walk in the woods n. A time spent out of general
circulation or out of power. As in: “The product was a
disaster, so they sent him for a walk in the woods”.
[Hoping, perhaps, that the lions would get him?] See
penalty box, lion food.
| walk up and use adj. Of a software application, or a
|
combination of hardware and software: ready to use
|
immediately.
“You plug the display, keyboard, and
|
printer into the system unit and you have a walk up and
|
use desktop publishing system.”
wall follower n. A simpleton, or one who goes by the
book.
“Joe is a real wall-follower.”
An early robot-
building contest which involved running a maze was
won by a mechanism which only sensed and followed
the right-hand wall.
It was called Harvey Wallbanger.
Robots that tried to learn as they traversed the maze did
not do as well.
Wansdyke n. Mysterious caverns in England, “some-
where” near the ancient Saxon earthwork known as
Wansdyke, where vital records are stored.
UK equiv-
alent of Iron Mountain, Salt Mine.
. warm body n. A real person (usually a programmer or
.
engineer).
A manager’s empire is measured by the
.
headcount allocated to him or her, but the headcount is
.
not necessarily filled. Usage: “How many warm bodies
.
will you have by April?”
warm fuzzies 1. n. The kind of feeling it is alleged that
you get when you think you are proceeding in the right
direction, or when you are being treated well by your
manager.
This state of mind is usually of short dura-
tion, 
and 
is 
succeeded 
by
cold
pricklies 
(q.v.).
|
2. n. Messages produced by a program to indicate that
|
it is alive and well but is likely to take some time to
|
finish its processing.
war room 1. n. The nerve centre of the operation to
control the development or maintenance of certain
products.
A room in or near to a development project,
filled with displays, telephones, specifications, wiring
diagrams, microcode listings, and the like. The purpose
is to employ the cream of the crop of engineers associ-
ated with a project to “make war” on failing machines.
Almost any solution can be used, but the best ones can
be translated immediately into 
ECs (Engineering
Changes). The modern term for such a place, “Support
Center”, somehow does not have the same aura (or
success).
When Big OS was first released (circa 1965) a room
was dedicated in building 705, Poughkeepsie, to provide
immediate assistance to users.
This room was desig-
nated the “World-wide APAR Response Room” – a
name inevitably shortened to “war room”. It was proba-
bly the first so named.
2. n. A room set aside in a
marketing (sales) location for intensive planning,
predicting, and point tallying at crucial times in the year.
The room looks like a battlefield, since the walls, tables,
and floor are generally covered with flipchart paper full
of numbers and words, presenting the expected customer
installs and the resulting points (until the end of the
war).
water n. Orders for equipment which the customer does
not intend to accept.
“The first-day orders set a new
record, but they must be at least a third water”.
Major
causes include: place-holding orders while the customer
tries to figure out what has been announced; dropout
due to multi-year delivery schedules; and Christmas
presents to deserving salesmen.
| watercool v. Usually of a computer: to cool, using
|
chilled water.
water-cooled engineer n. A service engineer who
refuses to work on machinery that is not water-cooled.
|
“If it isn’t water-cooled, it’s a terminal!” (Only large
processors are water-cooled.)
. water MIPS n. Processing power that is provided by
.
large water-cooled computers such as 3090s.
As in:
.
“Longer term, we see all computing power being deliv-
.
ered by water MIPS or desk MIPS”.
See also desk
.
MIPS, MIPS.
Watson Freeway n. The sections of Interstates 684 and
287 which connect Corporate HQ (Armonk) with NCD
HQ (1133, see below) via Harrison.
Watson’s Law n. The reliability of machinery is
inversely proportional to the number and significance of
any persons watching it. (This well-known rule applies
to all demonstrations of new equipment, software, etc.)
wave a dead chicken v. To offer a forlorn hope; a
burnt offering or witchcraft.
As in: “I’ll just wave a
dead chicken over the dump”, which means “I’ll give it
a go, but don’t expect too much”.
| we agree response. “No, we haven’t done that yet, and
|
we wish we’d thought of it ourselves.” (Response to
|
questions of the form: “Shouldn’t you return the misdi-
|
rected mail to the sender, instead of just throwing it
|
away?”)
weenie n. The “;” (semi-colon) character on a keyboard.
“To get back to the first screen, type in a 2 comma 7
weenie and hit ENTER”.
wet adj. Of a mainframe: cooled by chilled water.
This
describes water-cooled computers such as the 308x and
309x ranges. Mainly used in the locution “wet box”.
. whim of record n. A plan of record (q.v.) that changes
.
weekly (or more frequently).

white socks type
work-around
white socks type n. Anyone in CSD or FED, divisions
now amalgamated to form the NSD (National Service
Division [A name unlikely to catch on in the UK, where
National Service used to be the euphemism for military
conscription]).
IBM engineers traditionally wore white
socks under dark suits, and it is said that some still do.
“Anyone for tennis?”
WIBNI (wib-knee)
n. Acronym for “Wouldn’t It Be
Nice If”, usually used to refer to useful but difficult-to-
implement additions to software systems.
“I have a
WIBNI for the zorch function.”
wild duck n. A creative technical person who does
unconventional things, or at least does things in an
unconventional way.
Implies respect, and an acknowl-
edgement that many of that person’s ideas turn out to be
valuable.
It is said that IBM does not mind having a
few wild ducks around – so long as they fly in forma-
tion.
This term was created by T. J. Watson Jr., who told
a story (by the philosopher Kirkegaard) about a flock of
wild ducks that landed near a farm.
Some got fed by
the farmer and stayed, and either died of obesity or got
eaten. The truly wild ones flew away – and survived.
Winchester disk n. A hard (rather than floppy) disk
whose head rests upon the surface of the disk when
stationary. The name “Winchester” was first used as the
code name for a disk storage device being developed at
the IBM San Jose engineering laboratories around 1973,
and has since become the industry generic term for that
disk technology.
The rationale for the name was the
original size of the twin storage modules, which were 30
Megabytes each, matching by analogy (30+30) the
|
cartridge used in a Winchester 30-30 rifle. (In this case
|
the first 30 refers to the calibre of the rifle, and the
|
second to the grains [weight] of powder used in the
|
cartridge.)
The Winchester was the first device whose
read/write head could actually rest upon the surface of
the disk without disastrous consequences.
The head
assembly mass was reduced from 300 grams for the
3330 disk to a feathery 18 grams, thus successfully
fulfilling the original aim of eliminating the costly head-
unloading mechanism.
The direct cost of the head
dropped by a factor of four as a consequence of this.
The capacity of the disk that was actually released as
the 3340 later grew to 35 and 70M, but the name stuck.
.
The name became public during a court case that
.
debated an attempt to misappropriate the technology.
.
The term “Winchester” was a convenient handle for
.
describing the intellectual property, and came up regu-
.
larly in the court and in the reports of journalists cover-
.
ing the trial.
window 1. n. A timing problem due to a logical error.
An unlikely set of circumstances which were not
allowed for, although probably understood. Usually the
amount of code required to “close the window” is
inversely proportional to the size of the window open-
ing.
Murphy’s Law normally prevails, so the problem
caused by the window will not appear until after FCS –
by which time the person who left the window open is
nowhere in sight. 2. n. A portion of a display screen. It
can also be used as a verb to mean the process of defin-
ing the windows on a screen. “Who did the windowing
on this panel?” 3. n. An Early Retirement opportunity.
An occasional chance to retire early on favourable
terms.
There was one such window at the Owego
location a few years ago, and many people took advan-
tage of it.
Everyone there [’tis said] who is even close
to retirement kept wondering (aloud) when the next
window would be.
Their prayers were answered in
1986.
| window-dressing 1. n. Something put in a business
|
case (q.v.) to make it look better or even good. 2. n. A
|
“graphical” or “window” interface added to an otherwise
|
deficient program to make it appear more attractive.
. winged comments n. Comments set on the same line
.
as a program statement and which (in the ideal case)
.
only refer to that one statement.
If statements are kept
.
short and the winged comments are descriptive then
.
such commentary can considerably enhance the quality
.
of the code.
wing it v. Just go and do it any old way [does not imply
any skill in improvisation]. “In this location, we design
the hardware, software, and microcode for a project.
When no one can figure out why it doesn’t function, we
then spend a few months writing specifications of what
was thought to be developed.” When the final result is
apparent, it is always discovered that the result of
winging-it is not what was intended.
wing-tipped warrior n. An experienced and proficient
IBM Marketing Representative.
A Wing-Tip is a style
of dress shoe that has a “wing like” pattern of dots
punched in the leather on the toes. See also rep, power
suit.
wingtips n. Official IBMdom.
As in: “Yes, Mr.
Customer, if this system fails, we’ll Darken The Sky
With Wingtips”. See also help.
winnie n. A small format (usually 5.25 inch) hard disk.
This is a diminutive for Winchester (q.v.) and [I think]
has no connection with the noise often made by the
disk.
. wishlet n. A small wish, more practical than a WIBNI.
wishlist n. A list of WIBNIs and Nice To Haves for a
program or other tool.
When “prioritized”, this may
become a priority list (q.v.); but in general the future of
the items on the list is very variable, and depends large-
ly on how much spare time the author gets from IBM,
family, etc. in order to implement items on the Wishlist.
. woodshed n. A figurative [virtual?] place where a
.
person is taken for admonition.
A place of temporary
.
residence, unlike a penalty box.
As in: “John Akers
.
took his managers to the woodshed after seeing the
.
Fortune 
magazine 
article 
on 
Most 
Admired
.
Corporations”.
In North America in olden days, the
.
woodshed was far enough from the house that children
.
could be disciplined there without unduly disturbing the
.
rest of the family.
woof and whinny n. A high level and perhaps rather
theatrical “show and tell” with a lot of yelling and
screaming. See dog and pony show.
. wordsmith v. To create or edit a memo, letter, or other
.
document with a word processor or editing program,
.
usually with a view to improving it or making it more
.
acceptable to others; to fiddle with the words in a docu-
.
ment.
As in: “I have to wordsmith that memo before I
.
send it to anyone”.
work-around 1. n. A technique suggested by an engi-
neering or programming department for getting around a
major blunder until a more permanent repair can be
made. “We are aware that the real-time clock will give
ambiguous date/time readings at midnight.
If you
MUST run your on-line applications 24 hours a day,
you should instruct your machine operators to put the
machine in STOP for the minute or so around midnight.
This work-around will have to be employed until 1992,
when we plan to release a new feature that corrects this
minor imperfection”. 2. n. A design change installed in
a machine under test.
The work-around is usually to
allow continued testing by the bypassing of a failing
function.
The bypassed functions must be fixed (all
work-arounds removed) before the machine design can

working as designed
&
be accepted.
[This technique can also be applied while
debugging programs.]
working as designed adj. Of a program or piece of
hardware: not working as a user wants, but nevertheless
working as specified.
Used as a reason for not accept-
ing a criticism or suggestion.
. write-only
adj. Of 
program 
code: 
unreadable,
.
unfathomable.
Used in a derogatory way to refer to
.
others’ coding practices, especially when used to refer to
.
APL:
“Since his APL code is write-only we’ll have to
.
find some other way to communicate with the software
.
folk.” The term is also used affectionately between
.
APLers:
“I understand your routine perfectly.
This
.
proves once again that APL is not write-only...”
. wrt preposition. With Respect To.
Also used (with
.
confusion) as an abbreviation for “write” . See also btw.
WYSIWYG (wizzy-wig) 1. adj. What You See Is What
You Get.
Applied to a text, graphics, or image editor
that tries to show on the screen exactly what will appear
on the printed page.
WYSIWYG technology is rather
crude at present, prompting the comment “What You
See Is All You Get”, but it seems that this kind of
.
display is appropriate for certain applications.
[This
.
term was first used in IBM by the 5520 and text archi-
.
tecture designers, in 1977-78.] Also WYSLN (wizz-lin)
– What You See Looks Natural. 2. adj. Of a display
panel: having no help. “All of our interactive functions
have been rewritten using WYSIWYG panels.” See also
user-friendly.
| XA n. Extended Architecture.
The extension of the
|
System/370 architecture from 24-bit addressing (allow-
|
ing access to 16 Megabytes of storage) to 31-bit
|
addressing (allowing access to 128 times as much).
. yabafu n. An append that is empty or contains only boil-
.
er plate text.
Originally (1986) meant “Yet Another
.
Blank Append From Uithone”, referring to numerous
.
empty appends from that nodeid which plagued confer-
.
ences and which were caused by user interface problems
.
in some Uithone-specific exec.
Can also describe any
.
major publication blunder (such as the XT/286 adver-
.
tisement in the Daily Telegraph of 29 December 1986
.
which featured a [then absurd] 20 Meg slimline
.
diskette).
| yearend n. A time, strictly speaking in December, of
|
intense workload (and paranoia) in sales and marketing
|
areas.
This is the period when salespeople strive to
|
meet their targets and everyone else tries to keep out of
|
their way. The exact “date” of yearend is around Janu-
|
ary 7th, depending on flexibility of local systems and
|
the deadlines set by headquarters locations.
yellow brick road n. Route 9, Poughkeepsie. The road
on which you travel to see the Wizard of OZ. See OS.
| yellow layer n. Communications software. See layer.
yellow wire 1. n. A hardware fix.
Products whose
connections were mainly printed-circuits
had fixes and
overflows manually connected using yellow wires.
The
reliability of a product is inversely proportional to the
number of yellow wires. 2. v. To wire-wrap.
“Of
course they had trouble building the 801 prototype using
ECL – it was yellow-wired!” A piece of hardware that
is built entirely manually may be connected by wires
coated in a yellow plastic, connecting components by
wrapping the copper wire around their projecting parts.
This technique for prototyping was superseded by
meltable-insulation wiring, around 1977. See also blue
wire, purple wire.
. Yorkthorne
n. The 
Hawthorne 
extension 
of 
the
.
T. J. Watson
Research
Laboratory
at
Yorktown
.
Heights, NY.
Yorktownism n. An incantation (q.v.) that works only
on the Yorktown version of a standard operating system.
Yorktown is infamous for running the most adulterated
VM systems in the company – as many toolsmiths there
have discovered when they tried to let others use their
work.
| yo-yo v. To repeatedly crash and be restarted; to go up
|
and down many times.
As in: “TOROLAB6 has been
|
yo-yoing all day today”.
zap 1. v. To alter the machine code of a program by
storing directly into main storage, or by running a
program (known as SuperZap) to have a similar effect
on the disk-resident copy of a program.
This practice
started in the days when a proper change to program
source followed by reassembly was a task measured in
hours. Now a term for shoddy, incomplete work which
is likely to cause trouble in future because the running
version of a program no longer agrees with its source –
a situation that inevitably leads to problems. “We’ll just
zap it for now and hope tomorrow never comes”.
Nowadays zapping is a dying art, and can itself take
hours, but it may well see a renaissance as OCO
becomes wide-spread.
See also patch. 2. v. To use a
“Zapper” to discharge static electricity near various
sensitive parts of a computer.
This test determines
whether the machine will survive a visit in the dry
winter-time by an active young woman wearing a silk
blouse, silk slip, and wool skirt.
Z-Block (zed-block)
n. The first temporary building in
Hursley, there before IBM moved in, which was used by
Supermarine for Spitfire (a World War II fighter
aircraft) design.
The legendary birthplace of the
Hursley Programming Centre.
Now describes the 2nd
floor West Wing of D-Block, home of the new CICS
design technology (which uses Z-notation).
. zero-content
adj. Of a document or presentation:
.
containing no useful information.
(Though probably
.
very wordy and beautifully illustrated.) See content.
zipperhead 1. n. One who has a closed mind.
Said to
be most frequently used in Development Laboratories,
especially those with a high average age of employee.
2. n. beamer (q.v.).
. zoo n. The VM Systems Programming department (circa
.
1978) in Toronto, Canada (now called VM Software
.
Services). The nickname arose because many people in
.
the department collected stuffed animals; in time it
.
became pervasive – software tools designed and written
.
by the Zoo were distributed widely, and there are few
.
VM systems in IBM without at least one module that
.
includes the epithet “Property of the Zoo”.
These
.
modules have the prefix EMS (DMS, which belonged to
.
CMS, with the D changed to E for “Extension”).
.
Students of British broadcasting will recognise the
.
relevance of the Monty Python sketch that ends “and
.
now it’s time for the penguin on top of your television
.
set to explode”.
& (ampersand) 
1. n. A character used in many IBM
macro and command languages in order to distinguish
data from keywords.
This helps to make them hard to
read and to type, and so adds to the mystique surround-
ing programmers that use such languages.
Sometimes
used doubled, for double confusion. See command
.
language. 2. adj. Fluid in name.
When the name of a
.
project or future product is (or is likely to be) changed
.
many times, the authors of its documentation will often
.
use a variable symbol to represent the name that is likely
.
to be changed.
In the standard IBM documentation
.
language, SCRIPT, such symbols are identified by a
.
leading ampersand.
This usage carries forward into
.
speech, where one speaks of the “ampersand xyz”

symbol.
. * (asterisk)
n. A character used (among other things) to
.
denote emphasis. Most softcopy text (such as electronic
.
mail and forums) is in a single font; to indicate emphasis
.
without the blatancy of Great Runes (q.v.), text can be
.
enclosed in asterisks. Usage: “Do you *really* want the
.
PURGE RDR default to be SYSTEM ALL?”
Since
.
emphasised words are often set in italics, the asterisk is
.
also used to mark items normally presented in italics,
.
such as book titles. See also splat, star out.
1133 1. n. The multiplexor enclosure for the 1130 Mini-
computer.
2. n. A division headquarters building in
Westchester Avenue, White Plains, NY. IBM buildings
in the USA each have an identifying number, and this
number is often used in references.
For example, the
801 minicomputer (whose architecture is used in the
IBM RT PC product) is named after Building 801, the
T. J. Watson
Research
Laboratory
near
Yorktown
Heights.
80-column mind n. A narrow or blinkered mind.
Usually applied to people who, conceptually at least,
would prefer to be able to lay their hands directly on
their data, and to whom the transition from cards to tape
was a traumatic experience. Nobody has dared tell them
about [magnetic] disks yet. (It is said that these people
will be buried “face down, 9-edge forward”, “face up,
12-edge first”, or “face down, nine to the throat” (q.v.).)
. 80x24 artist n. Person who can do nice drawings on a
.
non-graphic screen which has 24 or 25 rows of 80 char-
.
acters.
| 80-80 listing n. A program that could read a deck of
|
cards and print each 80-character card image as a new
|
line on a printer.
It’s said that it was possible to write
|
an 80-80 listing program on the initial program card for
|
the IBM 1401. See boot.
. 9-edge n. The bottom edge of a standard Hollerith
.
computer card.
So named because a card had twelve
.
rows; two at the top (variously named) and ten below
.
(named 0 through 9).
The lowest of these was row 9;
.
hence the nearest edge was 9-Edge.
(The other edge
.
was often known as the 12-edge.) See also face down,
.
nine to the throat.
