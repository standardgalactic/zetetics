Abstract 
In this study, appropriateness of acquiring basic skills are examined through the “orientation and preparatory studies” in the 
courses of mathematics and life sciences in the curriculum 1st grade. No study has been encountered in the literature yet regarding 
the evaluation of the orientation and preparatory program that underwent a short preparatory process such as three months and 
put into effect in 2012-2013 education years. In line with the findings obtained from the study, the orientation and preparatory 
program requires arrangement and improvement in terms of skill, attainment and development domains. Thus, it is considered 
that the skills, attainments and development domains that are specified in our study shall be exemplary to the development of the 
program.

Keywords: Orientation and preparatory studies, mathematics activities, social studies activities, 1st grade, 
1. Introduction 
Rather than directly initiating reading and writing activities in the 1st grade of elementary school, through 
orientation and preparatory activities, ensuring that students start school in a sound manner has been set as an 
objective. Accordingly, within a period of twelve weeks, activities called orientation and preparatory activities have 
been organized. The prepared activities have three basic objectives: The first is the facilitation of the orientation of 
new beginner students at primary school to the school, their peers, their teachers, the second is laying the foundation 
for reading and writing activities through preparatory activities for 1st grade elementary studies, and the third is to 
deal with Social Studies, Mathematics, Visual Arts, Music, Play and Physical Activities curriculum attainments at 
certain rates (MEB, 2012). The efficiency of knowledge and skills provided in the 1st grade of elementary school is 
directly proportional to the quality of the education provided and thus, the activities. The orientation activities 
introduced with the changes in the education system in the 2012-2013 academic period has the characteristics of 
being an introduction for the development of the skills that are desired to be acquired by students. The social studies 
and mathematics activities provided in the orientation and preparation guide are of great significance in terms of the 
courses they shall receive in the future and involves an orientation and preparation for the mathematics and social 
studies course. In this context, the purpose of the study is to investigate Mathematics and Social Studies activities

under orientation and preparatory activities in the 1st grade of elementary education in terms of acquiring basic 
skills. Answers to the following questions have been sought in the study: 
1. How is the development domain, basic skills and attainments of social studies activities in the orientation 
and preparatory process? 
2. How is the development domain, basic skills and attainments of mathematics activities in the orientation and 
preparatory process? 
3. How is the evaluation of social studies and mathematics activities in the orientation and preparatory process 
in terms of basic skills? 
2. Method  
The study was prepared based on the descriptive research method. According to this method, 33 mathematics 
activities and 45 social studies activities in the orientation and preparatory process were used in data collection. The 
activities were descriptively examined and analyzed in terms of development domains (Psychomotor Domain, 
Social-emotional Domain, Language Domain, and Cognitive Domain), basic skills, and attainments. Tables of the 
attainments, skills, and development domains of activities in the orientation and preparatory curriculum were 
prepared and preschool, 1st Grade Elementary Social Studies, and 1st Grade Elementary Mathematics curriculum 
were taken as a basis (MEB, 2005: 5-27; Okul Öncesi Eğitim Programı (36-72 aylık çocuklar için), nd.). 
3. Findings 
3.1. Findings regarding the first problem 
The activities were analyzed for the purpose of answering the question of “How is the development domain, 
basic skills and attainments of social studies activities in the orientation and preparatory process?” and Table 1 was 
composed.

Research 
 
     When the social studies activities in the orientation and preparatory process were examined, it could be observed 
that it was prepared in conformity with 14 separate skills. The social studies activities in the program were mostly 
prepared for the purpose of developing the skills of communication, self-care, and creative thinking. It could be 
observed that the activities were prepared with the combination of Preschool and 1st Grade attainments. In this 
context, it has been asserted that there are a total of 21 activities addressing the psychomotor development of 
students. It has been determined that a total of 32 activities that could develop social and emotional development 
were associated with attainments. It is striking that the 13th and 14th activities under the social studies activities were 
arranged contrary to the logical ordering of the activities. While classroom rules were being addressed in the 
orientation and preparatory program, it was moved onto the 13th article titled “Weird Animals”, which is not among 
the preschool and 1st grade attainments. In this context, it was determined that there was no transition between 

4065
 Burcu Sezginsoy Şeker and Emine Özdemir /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  116 ( 2014 )  4062 – 4068 
activities. It can be observed that the visual in the activity titled “We are Celebrating October 29” was not suitable 
for the acquisition of attainments. In the provided visual, further to the absence of the picture of Ataturk, it is not 
certain where the concerned celebration was held or what type of celebration it is (end of year ball, birthday 
celebration etc.). Based on this, it can be recommended that there is a photo regarding national holidays in the 23rd 
activity. The activity titled “take a walk with butterflies” appears to be an activity stranded between activities mostly 
addressing the subjects of Ataturk and October 29. The purpose of this activity is to have students attain the skill of 
“correctly perceiving time and space”. The same skill can be encountered in the mathematical activities. Thus, the 
activity can be associated to the order the mathematics activity is provided. As there are no suitable attainments in 
the preschool and 1st grade mathematics program for the activity titled “Stone,” “there is a need to redevelop an 
attainment.The activity should be readjusted in a manner establishing definitions or concepts regarding social 
studies.   
3.2. Findings regarding the second problem 
     The activities were analyzed in order to seek an answer to the question of “How is the development domain, 
basic skills and attainments of mathematics activities in the orientation and preparatory process?” and Table 2 was 
composed.

     For the purpose of developing the reasoning and problem solving skills of students under the scope of the 
mathematics course, activities such as ordering, comparing, remembering, Pairing, using numbers in daily life, basic 
measurement activities, grouping objects, completing patterns, and supporting visual perception constitute the 
overall activities of the orientation and preparatory process (MEB, 2012). In this context, activities oriented at the 
specified skills have been encountered and various skills such as creative thinking, number sense, algebraic thinking, 
and representing mathematical knowledge in various forms have appeared. It can be observed that mathematical 
activities have mostly been oriented at the cognitive domain. The 9th, 10th, and 11th mathematics activities in the 
orientation and preparatory process are oriented at the “skill of correctly perceiving time and space”, which is also 
present in the social studies activities. In the 18th activity the mathematics and music courses are associated. In this 
context, the mathematics and social studies courses are being associated and presented in the orientation and 
preparatory process. The 23rd activity is considered to be difficult to comprehend by the students. This is because 
there are ambiguous expressions in the directives in the activity. It needs to be reorganized and simplified in a 
manner that can be understood by the student. Accordingly, for the purpose of clarifying the rules of the game it 
would be suitable to make an explanation by providing an example.  The same can be encountered in the 4th activity.    
      It was observed that the 27th activity was prepared above the level of students. For this case, it is recommended 
that the level of the activity is made suitable for the levels of the students. As there were no attainments suitable for 
the preschool and 1st grade mathematics programs in the 19th, 28th, and 32nd activities, a need for the development of 
new attainments appeared. In line with the opinions of program specialists, suitable attainments were developed. It 
was observed that with 3 different activities the first knowledge on geometric shapes was aimed. As no skills with 

4067
 Burcu Sezginsoy Şeker and Emine Özdemir /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences  116 ( 2014 )  4062 – 4068 
the geometry domain were defined in the program, the skill desired to be attained with these activities was defined 
as the “skill of recognizing geometric shapes,” which is the first of geometric thinking levels. A similar case was 
experienced in the “graphic composition activity”, which is the 26th activity.  For this activity, the skill of “Number 
Sense” (Olkun, 2001:25) was considered to be suitable. It was determined that the 31st activity was not associated to 
the mathematics course in the program. Thus, it is considered that it will be suitable to revise the activity.  
 
3.3. 
Findings regarding the third problem 
      It was observed that when the orientation and preparatory program was being developed, the skills desired to be 
attained were taken as a basis rather than subject integrity. These skills are achieved through activities to be 
performed by students.  When activities in the orientation and preparatory program were examined, it could be 
observed that these skills were expressed as self-care, daily living skills, and research skills (MEB, 2012:1). 
However, when the activities were examined, it can be observed that skills such as communication, emotion 
management, decision making, self-knowledge-personal development monitoring, participation-sharing-teamwork, 
and cooperation, recognizing the basic concepts of science, ethical behavior, and reasoning were attempted to be 
provided through activities. According to Table 3, it was asserted that the skill of communication was desired to be 
provided the most. This demonstrates parallelism with the social studies program prepared for the purpose of 
adaptation to real life. The skill of research that was desired to be attained through 19 activities in the 1st grade social 
studies curriculum was only addressed in 4 activities in the orientation and preparatory program. Social studies 
activities should be prepared to wake up with a sense of wonder. However, it is considered that 4 activities 
pertaining to research skills are inadequate in the attainment of this understanding.

      Mathematics is defined today as knowledge and skills constituted with problem solving and interpretation, based 
on the modeling of reality (Santos- Trigo, 1998). The incompatibility of mathematics at schools with real life, the 
inadequacy of students in using knowledge and skills acquired at school in real life and problem solving, and 
students immediately reaching the result without thinking on problems and producing solution strategies,  has led to 
the increase in field studies concerning this topic. In this context, considering the principle of “each child can learn 
mathematics” in mathematics programs during the last decade, renewal activities are performed.  It is observed that 
this situation reflects on mathematics learning experiences in each level of education. Within the framework of the 
orientation and preparatory program formed by arranging the preschool and the 1st grade mathematics programs, in 
addition to the common skills, it is aimed that mathematics learning is made meaningful through skills such as the 
use of mathematics in daily life, problem solving, representing mathematical knowledge in different manners, 
number sense, estimating, and creative thinking. Besides, the activities that are not included for the purpose of 
evoking number sense in students are striking. When the activities in the program were examined, it was observed 
that this situation was paid attention to but activities at a sufficient level were not included.  It was determined that 
activities with an emphasis on operations such as counting, grouping, Pairing, and ordering were not included 
heavily.  Whereas, nowadays mathematics learning must start with sense-making.   However, it was revealed that 
this situation did not strike a balance despite by way of activities. The basis for the mathematical perceptions must 
be formed in the program in order to ensure that the students develop positive attitudes for mathematics and thus, the

relation of pre-conditionality must be paid attention in learning mathematics and research studies must be included 
for the students to use their mathematical knowledge.  With the studies that shall be performed in this direction, 
students’ achievements and motivations may be increased and in future years they may be provided the 
opportunities to construct their own knowledge easily. 
4. Conclusion and recommendations 
      When the activities in the orientation and preparatory program were examined, four common basic skills 
associated with mathematics and social studies courses were determined. These skills are the skills of “creative 
thinking,” “guessing,” “problem solving,” and “correct perception of time and space.”  When examined in terms of 
common skills, it was observed that social study activities were more effective in students’ multidimensional way of 
thinking. It is recommended that mathematical activities are diversified and their number is increased in terms of 
creative thinking, guessing, and problem solving. No study has been encountered in the literature yet regarding the 
evaluation of the orientation and preparatory program that underwent a short preparatory process such as three 
months and put into effect in 2012-2013 education years. From this aspect our study has the characteristics of being 
the first study in the field. In line with the findings obtained from the study, the orientation and preparatory program 
requires arrangement and improvement in terms of skill, attainment and development domains. Thus, it is 
considered that the skill, attainment and development domains that are specified in our study shall be exemplary to 
the development of the program.
