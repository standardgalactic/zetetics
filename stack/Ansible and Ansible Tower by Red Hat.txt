Why Is Automation  Important?
Your applications and systems are 
more than just collections of 
configurations. They’re a finely tuned 
and ordered list of tasks and processes 
that result in your working 
application.
 
Ansible can do it all:
  • Provisioning
  • App Deployment
  • Configuration Management
  • Multi-tier Orchestration
