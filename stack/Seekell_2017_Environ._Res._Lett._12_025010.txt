Abstract
Ensuring food security requires food production and distribution systems function throughout
disruptions. Understanding the factors that contribute to the global food system’s ability to respond
and adapt to such disruptions (i.e. resilience) is critical for understanding the long-term
sustainability of human populations. Variable impacts of production shocks on food supply between
countries indicate a need for national-scale resilience indicators that can provide global
comparisons. However, methods for tracking changes in resilience have had limited application to
food systems. We developed an indicator-based analysis of food systems resilience for the years
1992–2011. Our approach is based on three dimensions of resilience: socio-economic access to food
in terms of income of the poorest quintile relative to food prices, biophysical capacity to intensify or
extensify food production, and the magnitude and diversity of current domestic food production.
The socio-economic indicator has a large variability, but with low values concentrated in Africa and
Asia. The biophysical capacity indicator is highest in Africa and Eastern Europe, in part because of a
high potential for extensiﬁcation of cropland and for yield gap closure in cultivated areas. However,
the biophysical capacity indicator has declined globally in recent years. The production diversity
indicator has increased slightly, with a relatively even geographic distribution. Few countries had
exclusively high or low values for all indicators. Collectively, these results are the basis for global
comparisons of resilience between countries, and provide necessary context for developing
generalizations about resilience in the global food system.
1. Introduction
Achieving food security is central to the United
Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. The
UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
deﬁnes food security as ‘a situation that exists when
all people, at all times, have physical, social and
economic access to sufﬁcient, safe and nutritious
food that meets their dietary needs and food
preferences
for
an
active
and
healthy
life’
(FAO 2001). As a result, ensuring food security
requires that food production and distribution
systems function despite potential disruptions. It
also requires that all people have economic access to a
sufﬁcient amount of food to satisfy their nutritional
needs. Meeting this goal in the face of a growing
human population, shifting diets, limited natural
resources, climate change, and environmental vari-
ability is a major challenge of our time (Godfray et al
2010, Foley et al 2011).

The ability of a food system to respond and adapt to
disruptions, while maintaining its function, describes
the system’s resilience (Pingali et al 2005, Schipanski
et al 2016). Like all complex social-ecological systems,
resilience within food systems cannot be evaluated at
a single scale (Folke et al 2010, Béné et al 2016).
Consequently, local, global, and cross-scale interactions
must be included when evaluating resilience within the
increasingly globalized food system (Porkka et al 2013,
D’Odorico et al 2014, Gephart and Pace 2015,
MacDonald et al 2015). Further, food systems must
be evaluated with respect to both the short-term
responses andthe longer-term factors that contribute to
resilience (Pingali et al 2005, Béné et al 2016).
At the local scale, research on food systems
resilience has mostly focused on disaster response case
studies and detailed evaluations of infrastructure,
governance, and social networks (Béné et al 2016).
These analyses help identify features of resilient
systems including speciﬁc mechanisms that allow
them to respond and adapt to disruptions. For
example, in 1992–1993 food production in southern
Africa was adversely impacted by a drought related to
El Niño, but there was no regional food crisis. In
2002–2003 a similar drought caused a regional famine,
and this contrast has been interpreted as indicative of
declining resilience related to conﬂicts and adverse
impacts of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on social and
government institutions (Pingali et al 2005).
At the global level, resilience research has a
different focus, evaluating economic patterns and
relationships rather than food security for individuals
or households. Global-scale resilience has been studied
by tracking how shocks to the food system propagate
internationally (Marchand et al 2016). For instance,
extreme environmental conditions in 2007 and 2010
caused agricultural failures in some countries. Export
bans meant to protect populations in producing
countries came at the expense of nations reliant on
trade to balance their food needs (Fader et al 2013,
Baldos and Hertel 2015). Food prices rose sharply,
increasing the numbers of undernourished people and
creating social unrest including food riots (Fader et al
2013, Lagi et al 2011, Berazneva and Lee 2013, Baldos
and Hertel 2015). Studies combining population
dynamics, food production, and trade have found that
the global food system has become increasingly fragile
(Fraser et al 2005, D’Odorico et al 2010, Suweis et al
2015, Puma et al 2015, Marchand et al 2016). Global-
scale factors like trade may enhance food security
locally but reduce the resilience of the global food
system, while local scale factors that include more
proximal drivers of food security—such as grain
reserves or the potential to increase local food
production—act within the context of global scale
patterns and processes (Fraser et al 2005, D’Odorico
et al 2010, Baum et al 2015, Puma et al 2015, Fader
et al 2016, Gephart et al 2016, Marchand et al 2016,
Gephart et al 2017).
In order to track the evolution and current state
of resilience within the global food system, we
collected national level indicators at multiple time
points to evaluate the overall state and trajectory of
three dimensions of country-level resilience. The
indicators characterize: socio-economic access to
food in terms of income of the poorest quintile
relative to average food prices, biophysical capacity to
sustainably intensify or extensify food production,
and magnitude and diversity of domestic food
production. Here, we describe the geographic and
temporal (1992–2011) patterns of these resilience
indicators, and evaluate the indicators for potential
redundancies. Our analysis provides an opportunity
for global-scale generalizations and comparisons of
resilience at the country level, and the context
necessary for developing cross-scale analyses of food
systems resilience.
2. Methods
2.1. Conceptual basis
The resilience concept was popularized through
studies of ecosystems with alternative states. In this
context, resilience describes an ecosystem’s ability to
remain in a particular state under perturbations
(Holling 1973, Folke et al 2010). Since its introduc-
tion in ecology, resilience theory has been applied to a
wide range of complex systems and has adopted a
more general deﬁnition of ‘the capacity of a system to
absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing
change so as to still retain essentially the same
function, structure, identity, and feedbacks’ (Walker
et al 2004). Operationally, the concept has been used
in several ways, including as a metaphor associated
with sustainability, a feature of dynamic models, and
a quantiﬁable ﬁeld measurement (Carpenter et al
2001).
The resilience concept can be applied across
multiple scales (Béné et al 2016). For example,
factors inﬂuencing household-level resilience in-
clude the maintenance or sale of assets like livestock
and dietary variation of meals (Misselhorn 2005). At
the national scale, resilience is inﬂuenced by factors
like margins of self-sufﬁciency and ﬁnancial ability
to balance food deﬁcits with imports from other
countries (e.g. Suweis et al 2015). Other attributes
including production diversity and the size of
national grain reserves contribute to the ability to
avoid or cope with disruptions and are therefore
used as general indicators of resilience (e.g. Walker
and
Salt
2006).
Finally,
at
the
global
level,
factors including the structure of trade networks
inﬂuence the propagation of perturbations between
countries and overall stability or fragility of the
globalized food system (e.g. D’Odorico et al 2010,
Puma et al 2015, Gephart et al 2016, Marchand
et al 2016).

Quantitative methods for tracking changes in
resilience remain best developed in ecology (e.g. van
Nes and Scheffer 2007, Scheffer et al 2009, Carpenter
et al 2011). Key ecosystem variables are monitored and
individually evaluated for reductions in the rate of
return to equilibrium after perturbations—known as
critical slowing down—measured as changes in
autocorrelation and variance. These methods are
effective at evaluating resilience in a diverse array of
ecosystems (Drake and Griffen 2010, Carpenter et al
2011, Dakos et al 2012, Kéﬁet al 2014). These metrics
have subsequently been extended to track changes in
the resilience of socio-ecological networks (Suweis and
D’Odorico 2014). The global food system can be
conceptualized as a complex network where countries
are nodes with endogenously resilient food production
systems and consumption, where international trade
connects nodes and acts as another source of
resilience. The network theory framework has allowed
critical slowing down and related approaches to
evaluating changes in resilience to be applied to the
global food system (e.g. D’Odorico et al 2010, Suweis
et al 2015). However, there are important limitations
to applying the resilience metrics developed by
ecologists to food systems. Speciﬁcally, application
of critical slowing down based resilience metrics
tested by ecologists assumes there is no difference in
key functional structure between social institutions
and ecosystem processes, an assumption that is
contested by some social scientists (Adger 2000,
Barrett and Constas 2014, Olsson et al 2015, Béné
et al 2016). Additionally, critical slowing down based
resilience metrics only indicate that change may
occur; they do not discriminate between impending
shifts to conditions of decreased human well-
being
versus
transitions
to
improved
human
well-being (Bauch et al 2016). Hence, existing
approaches cannot yet fully describe patterns and
processes relative to resilience in the global food
system (Béné et al 2016).
A pragmatic way to complement critical slowing
down based resilience metrics is to develop an index-
based analysis of the capacity of countries to handle
shocks (e.g. Allison et al 2009, Fader et al 2016,
Marchand et al 2016). Index based methods rely on
surrogate measures that reﬂect aspects of resilience
that are difﬁcult to measure or model (Adger 2000,
Carpenter et al 2005). Additionally, directional change
in indicators can have explicit interpretations, whereas
critical slowing down based methods are more
ambiguous about the nature of change (Bauch et al
2016). Here, we focus on developing indicators for
national-scale resilience. We have selected the national
scale for four reasons:
1. Domestic and foreign policies are set at the
national level and thus provide the context in
which
proximal
causes
and
consequences
of
individual food security or lack thereof occur.
2. A recent review found that most analyses of
resilience in food systems are at the household or
community scale and broader scale analyses are
lacking (Béné et al 2016).
3. National scale indicators of food security are
available with global coverage. Finer scale (e.g.
household) metrics are available, but typically not
with global coverage (Naiken 2003).
4. Many indicators of food security at the national
scale are available as time series, allowing us to
track inter-annual variability and longer-term
changes in ways not possible at smaller scales.
We consider three main dimensions of resilience
within an index framework: the ability to access food
which is based on social and economic factors,
biophysical capacity to increase food production
through sustainable intensiﬁcation or extensiﬁca-
tion, and the magnitude and diversity of domestic
food production (ﬁgure 1). For each dimension, we
created an aggregate index of resilience based on
two to three key indicators. We described these
indicators and indices in detail below and have
made them available on Github (doi: 10.5281/
zenodo.192394).
2.2. Access to food
Access to food is chieﬂy a socio-economic issue related
to prices and income (Barrett 2010). Typically, a
country’s poor are most likely to suffer from food
insecurity (Bohle et al 1994, Timmer 2000). Being
poor does not necessarily imply food insecurity, but it
does limit options during periods of price spikes, crop
failures for subsistence farmers, or loss of assets such as
livestock (Timmer 2000). Therefore, we consider
resilience to be higher in countries where the poor
have higher income relative to food prices, compared
to countries where the poor have low incomes relative
to food prices (Timmer 2000). Other socio-economic
factors including levels of education, especially for
women, and investments in infrastructure inﬂuence
food security and resilience at local scales, but we focus
on income related factors here because these are
thought to be the primary inﬂuence on food security
when evaluated at broad scales (Timmer 2000,
Godfray et al 2010).
We calculated an index of socio-economic access
to food based on two indicators: the average income of
the lowest 20% of each country’s income distribution
(per capita) and average per capita food expenditure
(cf. Timmer 2000). This metric reﬂects a measure of
liquid assets that can be readily exchanged for food.
Estimates of the income of the lowest 20% of the
population are based on several sources. Most values
were based on income data from the World Bank,
estimated using their PovcalNet tool (http://iresearch.
worldbank.org/PovcalNet/index.htm). In some cases,
there were not enough values in the World Bank
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 025010

dataset, so we used data from the United Nations
University WIID 3.3 database (www.wider.unu.edu/
download/WIID3.3). Average food expenditure per
capita was based on the FAO Domestic Food Price Level
Index. This indicator represents the price of food in
each country relative to the United States in purchasing
power parity terms. Data were not available for all years,
so we used logarithmic interpolation to complete time
series. For 70 countries, this interpolation was based on
ﬁve observations during the period 1992–2014. For
24 countries it was based on four observations, but with
at least one observation before 1990. We combined the
income and food price indicators into a single index by
taking the ratio of income to food price. Lower values
suggest increasing trade-offs with other critical expen-
ditures (e.g. housing) and reduced ability to make-up
caloric deﬁcits through food purchases.
2.3. Biophysical capacity to produce food
We conceptualize the biophysical capacity to produce
food as a function of area of suitable uncultivated
land, untapped freshwater resources, and potential for
closure in agricultural yield gaps (percentage of actual
production divided by potential production). Increas-
ing either of these factors will increase the biophysical
capacity of countries to ramp-up food production
through extensiﬁcation (putting unused land and
water resources into production) or intensiﬁcation
(decreasing
yield
gap
through
nutrient
supply,
irrigation, or utilizing new technology) in the case
of increased demand or decreased production capacity
(Fader et al 2016). Having little unused land or water
resources, or no possibility to reduce yield gap,
indicates limited ability to increase food production
domestically.
In
this
sense
biophysical
capacity
contributes to resilience as a form of redundancy
(e.g. Walker and Salt
2006). Intensiﬁcation or
extensiﬁcation of agricultural production mainly
occurs over longer time spans because of the time
necessary to obtain capital, develop these new
resources, and distribute technologies to improve
yield gaps (Godfray et al 2010).
Here,
we
use
a
biophysical
capacity
index
developed and described by Fader et al (2016). This
index is based on three indicators: volume of
renewable freshwater resources, availability of farm-
able land for agricultural extensiﬁcation, and ability to
intensify agriculture as indicated by the yield gap
(Fader et al 2016). Brieﬂy, volume of freshwater
resources was estimated based on data from the FAO
AQUASTAT database. Unused resources were calcu-
lated as the total renewable freshwater resources minus
water withdraws, environmental ﬂow requirements,
and the amount of water that is unavailable due to
seasonal variability, rainfall intensity, spatial access, or
lack of infrastructure. Unused arable land resources
were estimated based on the HYDE 3.2 land use
database
(http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/thema
sites/hyde/) and the FAO Global Agro-Ecological
Zones database. Unused arable land was calculated as
total land area minus land area already used for
agriculture (excluding pastures), land not suitable for
agriculture, and land used for urban areas and other
types of human settlement. Finally, yield gap was
estimated as the difference of actual yields for a given
year and the maximum yields in similar areas given
ideal fertilization and irrigation minus actual produc-
tion, multiplied by the spare and used areas. These
maximum
values
were
estimated
following
the
approaches of Mueller et al (2012). For each factor,
we compiled values for the years 1992–2011. Fader
et al (2016) considered a variety of scenarios
representing different levels of availability for unused
land and water resources. For the present analysis, we

Figure 1. Three dimensions of resilience considered in this analysis. A national-scale index was created to track each dimension. Each
index has global coverage. These dimensions reﬂect the FAO deﬁnition of food security, speciﬁcally that all people have physical
(biophysical capacity), social and economic access (socio-economic index) to sufﬁcient, safe and nutritious food that meets their
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life (production diversity index).

consider values from the middle scenario. The values
for each index were combined into an aggregate
biophysical capacity measure by assuming that land
and water were non-substitutable, but that yield gap
was substitutable with these factors. In other words,
increasing the amount of available farmland does not
increase biophysical capacity to produce food if there
is not also available water. However, extensifying or
potential for intensifying (yield gap closure) can both
(or either) be used to increase biophysical capacity.
This index is scaled between 0 and 1, with values less
than 0.5 indicating limited water, land, or productivity
redundancy and an inability to produce at least
3000 kcal d1 per capita, a widely used value of dietary
energy (Fader et al 2016).
2.4. Production diversity
We consider production diversity to be related to the
ability of countries to reliably meet food demand
through domestic production (Pingali et al 2005). This
means maintaining a high level of production despite
(mostly) stochastic factors, such as weather variations
including heat waves and drought, biotic inﬂuences
including
invasive
species
and
pests,
plus
the
consequences of local management decisions that
include salinization and lost production due to over-
grazing (Walker and Salt 2006, D’Odorico et al 2010).
Average production (kcal per capita) reﬂects the ability
of countries to meet caloric needs in a typical year, but
not the resilience of countries to short-term shocks
that could decrease food availability over months or
years. For example, a country could have high
production per capita, but if the majority of calories
are from just a few commodities, then this supply
stream could be vulnerable to crop-speciﬁc pests or
weather outside the dominant crops’ optimum range.
In general, more diverse systems are thought to exhibit
higher aggregate stability due to species asynchrony,
portfolio effects, and a number of other mechanisms
(Chapin et al 2000, Schindler et al 2010, Tilman et al
2014). Hence, we consider countries with high
production for a greater variety of crops to be more
resilient than countries with low production or low
diversity in production.
We calculated the ‘h-index’ from bibliometric
analyses as an index that balances indicators of total
production and breadth of production (Hirsch 2005).
First, we calculated the annual domestic production
per capita of each commodity, Ci, in each country:
Ci ¼ Ki=Pi
where Ki is the total kcal produced by a commodity
in a given year and country, and Pi is the population. Ki
was determined using the FAO commodities produc-
tion database (given in units of weight) and using
the FAO conversion factors to express Ki in kcal
(D’Odorico et al 2014, http://faostat.fao.org). We
focus
on
calories
instead
of
other
nutritional
characteristics (e.g. protein or micronutrient content)
because it is easily comparable across countries and
is also the basis for the biophysical capacity
indicator (Fader et al 2016). For the diversity
analysis, we only considered primary food products,
which prevents double counting of caloric produc-
tion through the production of secondary products,
like ﬂours or processed animal products (D’Odorico
et al 2014). We then calculated each country’s
h-index for the years 1992–2011. All Ci were ordered
from greatest to least and given a rank depending on
their order in this sequence (i.e. the highest Ci has a
rank of 1, the second highest has a rank of 2, and so
on). Then, we calculated the h-index as the largest
rank for which the rank is equal or less than the
corresponding Ci. In other words, an h-index of
20 would indicate that a country has 20 commodi-
ties that produce at least 20 kcal per capita. A
country can only score a high xh-index value if it has
a production stream that has high production per
capita and is also diverse. For example, a country
that produced 1 500 kcal per capita of corn, but then
only 10 kcal per capita of nine other commodities
would have an h-index of 10.

2.5. Evaluation of redundancy between indicators
We evaluated the potential for redundancy between
indicators using Kendall’s t, a rank-based correlation
coefﬁcient (Kendall and Gibbons 1990). There was, at
most, a minor relationship between the indicators
(ﬁgure 2). Correlations between indicators were similar
for ﬁve-year averages at the beginning (1992–1996) and
end (2007–2011) of the records (table 1). In both cases
there was no signiﬁcant relationship between the
socioeconomic and biophysical capacity indicators,
and no signiﬁcant relationship between the biophysical
capacityandproductiondiversityindex.Thecorrelation
between the socio-economic indicator and production
diversity was statistically signiﬁcant, but the effect size
was weak at both the beginning and end of the record.
This analysis indicates that these three indicators have
minimal redundancy in capturing aspects of resilience.
3. Empirical results: geographic and
temporal patterns of resilience indicators
We evaluated patterns and changes in the resilience
indicators based on 5-year averages at the beginning
(1992–1996) and end (2007–2011) of the record
(ﬁgure 3). The distribution of the socio-economic
indicator was strongly right skewed throughout the
record (ﬁgure 3). Speciﬁcally, at the beginning of the
record 90% of countries had socio-economic indicator
values <1, indicating that their poor earn substantially
less than average food expenditures within the
country. In fact the median socio-economic indicator
values was just 0.04 (ﬁgure 4). At the end of the record,
86% of countries had socio-economic indicator values
<1 and the median indicator value had increased to
0.08 (ﬁgure 4). Across the record, high indicator values
were clustered in Western Europe and the lowest
values were clustered in Africa and Asia. Many of the
countries with the largest increases between the
beginning and end of the record were European
countries already with indicator values among the
highest globally (e.g. Norway, Switzerland, Finland,
Sweden).
The distribution of the biophysical indicator was
left-skewed
or
bimodal
throughout
the
record
(ﬁgure 3). At the beginning of the record, 41% of
countries had biophysical capacity indicators less than
the threshold (0.5) indicating limited capacity. This
increased to 47% by the end of the record. The median
indicator declined from 0.7 to 0.58 (ﬁgure 4). The
highest values of biophysical capacity were in Africa,
Eastern Europe, South America, and the United States.
Western and northern European countries have lower
biophysical capacities because they lack spare arable
land through which agriculture can be extensiﬁed
(Fader et al 2016). Despite this patterning, the declines
in biophysical capacity have been spread relatively
evenly between continents.
Production diversity had a unimodal distribution
throughout the record (ﬁgure 3). The median diversity
index for the beginning and end of the record, 46 and
47. Many of the biggest gains in the diversity index
occurred in Africa and the Middle East. China, the
United States, and several other countries with
temperate or Mediterranean climates maintained high
productivity diversity throughout the time-series. In
contrast, many countries in Africa, and areas with
semi-arid
and
the
tropical
climates
had
lower
production diversity. The positive, but weak relation-
ship between the socio-economic indicator and
production diversity suggests that wealthier nations
are more likely to have higher production diversity but
with large variations in this relationship.
Collectively, geographic patterns and lack of strong
correlation between indices demonstrate that there are
few countries with high values for all three dimensions
of resilience considered in this analysis. Hence, our
analysis shows different countries, and in many cases
different regions, are resilient (or lack resilience) in
different ways.
4. Discussion
The application of the resilience concept in the context
of food security has become more frequent both in the
Table 1. Correlations between indicators were weak indicating that they are not capturing redundant information. Kendall’s t correlation
coefﬁcients are given in the upper right of the matrices and the corresponding probability values are given in the lower left.

academic and policy arenas (Pingali et al 2005, Suweis
et al 2015, Béné et al 2016). Our analysis adds to these
developments by evaluating factors contributing to
resilience around the world. Our indices are available
in time series based on standardized data, which allows
for the evaluation of inter-annual variability and
longer-term changes. Hence, our results contribute to
ﬁlling a gap in the food security-resilience literature,
which is dominated by local-scale studies based on
individual hunger events (Béné et al 2016).
Our approach focuses on dimensions of resilience
and not on estimating or reducing numbers of
undernourished people. This difference in goals can
cause interpretations that run counter to common.
One example is that in our biophysical capacity index
we consider having high yield gap as high resilience,
whereas reduction of the yield gap is typically
identiﬁed as a goal to feed the growing human
population (Godfray et al 2010). While we agree with
this interpretation of the yield gap issue, our approach
notes there is a trade-off whereby yield gap reductions
limit the transformative capacity in the sense that
transformation of agricultural systems through inten-
siﬁcation is no longer a viable option to increasing

food production. Similar reasoning applies to exten-
siﬁcation in terms of the amount of viable farmland
currently in production where the production system
become more rigid in the sense that it is operating on
nearly all potentially arable land, reducing buffer area
(Fader et al 2016).
Our social-economic index is similar to the ‘share
of food expenditure by the poor’ index of food security
calculated by the FAO. However, the FAO index is only
available for a small number of countries and years,
which limits the potential to track geographic and
temporal patterns. We were able to calculate our socio-
economic indicator for 96 countries from 1992 to 2011
and these data are available on Github (doi: 10.5281/
zenodo.192394). A limitation of our socio-economic
index is that it compares the average per capita income
of the lowest 20% of the population to the overall
average food price indicator. It is probable that, for
households,
income
and
food
expenditures
are
correlated (e.g. Kirkpatrick and Tarasuk 2003). A
more comprehensive picture of food security among
the poor would be gained by adding a measure of
average food expenditures of the poor as a percentage
of total income, which would provide a proxy for food
access issues and tradeoffs with other essential
expenditures (Misselhorn 2005). Such disaggregated
data is not widely available, hence this index reﬂects
variation in the ability to buffer price shocks by
reducing non-food expenditures, but not the speciﬁc
amount of money spent or food actually acquired
(Timmer 2000). Overall, the socio-economic index
relates to the absorptive coping capacity of the poor,
especially in developing countries, and our study has
expanded the potential to evaluate this aspect of
resilience geographically and over time (Timmer 2000,
Béné et al 2016).

The production diversity index in our analysis
relates to the absorptive and adaptive capacities of
agricultural production, which are key dimensions of
resilience,
while
the
biophysical
capacity
index
accounts for the ability of the system to transform
agricultural systems through intensiﬁcation or exten-
siﬁcation. How these characteristics play out in
practice depends on local factors. For example, Japan
has little ability to transform its food production
system in the sense that it lacks arable land for
extensiﬁcation. Many African countries, like Angola
and Ghana have a high biophysical capacity, but the
actual
ability
to
transform
agricultural
systems
depends on the strength of local institutions, the
ability to raise capital to convert land for agriculture
and
implement
technologies
and
strategies
for
sustainable intensiﬁcation like integrated crop water
management, and the cultural acceptance of change
(Béné et al 2016, Jägermeyr et al 2016, MacDonald
et al 2016). On the other hand, a country like Japan
may have strong institutions and large amounts of
capital, but the biophysical limits of the country will
always constrain the transformability of agricultural
production. Connecting our indices with the speciﬁc
economics, governance, institutions, and cultures of
every country is beyond the scope of a single paper.
However,theseexamplesdemonstrateboththeutilityof
the global context contributed by our analysis, as well as
the need to integrate across scales and socio-environ-
mentalfactors,tohaveacompletepictureofresiliencein
the global food system.
Our analysis does not explicitly account for the
inﬂuence of international trade. Twenty-four percent
of food produced globally is traded between countries
and the speciﬁc patterns of trade connections between
countries may amplify or mufﬂe the transmission of
production shocks to consumers (D’Odorico et al
2014, d’Amour et al 2016, Marchand et al 2016). The
actual impact of trade-related shocks reﬂects a variety
of factors, but a key one is the self-sustainability of
crop production for a variety of crops that are
consumed domestically (d’Amour et al 2016). To a
large extent, our production diversity index reﬂects the
ability of a country to be self-sufﬁcient and to be self-
sufﬁcient for a variety of commodities, and hence
integrates
some
of
the
key
factors
inﬂuencing
vulnerability to shocks propagated through trade.
Other factors include the numbers of people living in
extreme poverty and this is, to some extent, integrated
within our socio-economic indicator (d’Amour et al
2016). Analyses of cereal trade networks and ﬁsh trade
networks have identiﬁed certain regions, especially
Central and West Africa, as susceptible to trade shocks
(Gephart et al 2016, Marchand et al 2016). Our
analysis ﬁnds that many of these countries have low
socio-economic index values (where available), low
production diversity, but high biophysical capacity.
Hence our results reﬂect the inﬂuence of trade on
resilience and emphasize the complex nature of food
systems’ resilience.
5. Conclusions
Achieving food security requires food production and
distributionsystemsthatare resilienttodisruption.This
study provides national-scale indices of food systems
resilience with global coverage from 1992 to 2011. Our
overallﬁnding isthatvery fewcountrieshave exclusively
high or low values for all dimensions, emphasizing
the complexity and heterogeneity of the global food
system. These indices create the opportunity for global
comparisons of resilience between nations, and provide
context for developing generalizations about the
resilience in the global food system.
