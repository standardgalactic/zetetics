 Due to patchy foreground absorption highly reddened Galactic globular clusters appear more flattened than less-r
 dened clusters. Comparison of little-reddened Galactic globulars with old clusters in the LMC shows that Cloud cluste
 are much more flattened than their galactic counterparts. This suggests that the cluster-forming process may differ signif
 cantly in dwarf and in giant galaxies.
 Using semipartial correlation coefficients and bootstrap techniques it may be shown that the ellipticity of LMC cl
 ters correlates significantly with cluster luminosity but not with cluster age. The cluster luminosity above which glob
 are noticeably flattened may differ by a factor of ~ 100 from galaxy to galaxy.
 The hypothesis that the intrinsic flattening of Galactic globulars is related to the "second parameter" problem rem
 unproven.
 Both in the Galaxy and in M31 globulars with small core radii have a Gaussian distribution over luminosity where
 clusters with large core radii do not. In the cluster systems surrounding the Galaxy, M31 and NGC 5128 the mean radi
 globular clusters increase with distance from the nucleus.
 The specific globular cluster frequency S appears to decrease along the sequence E-Sa-Sb-Sc. Real differences
 found in the S values for individual E galaxies. The mean specific cluster frequency in Virgo ellipticals may be higher 
 it is in E galaxies in small clusters. Central galaxies in rich clusters have much higher S values than do other cluster 
 ticals. This shows that such central galaxies must already have been different from normal ellipticals at the time th
 were formed.
 Key words: globular clusters - cluster flattening
 I. Introduction
 Since globular clusters are the oldest-known subunits
 of galaxies they can provide information on the earliest
 phases of galactic evolution. In the past most attention
 has been focused on cluster metallicity [Fe/H] and on
 the dependence of cluster metallicity on galactocentric
 distance. For reviews of this subject the reader is re-
 ferred to Harris and Racine (1979), Kraft (1979), Free-
 man and Norris (1981), Cannon (1982), and Hesser
 (1983). The present paper will concentrate instead on
 those features of globular-cluster populations that have
 been relatively neglected in the past such as: (1) total
 number of clusters and the dependence of specific clus-

 ter frequency on parent galaxy type, (2) cluster radii, (3)
 cluster luminosity functions, and (4) cluster ellipticity.
 Many of the new correlations that have been found, or
 are hinted at by presently available data, do not yet have
 explanations in terms of physical processes in the halos
 of protogalaxies. More observations of cluster magni-
 tudes, colors, etc., are urgently needed to strengthen and
 confirm some of these results.
 II. Cluster Ellipticity
 A. Correlation Between Flattening and Reddening of
 Galactic Globulars
 The name "globular cluster" was assigned to Galactic
 halo clusters of Population II because the majority of
 such objects have nearly spherical isophotes. An early
 study of cluster ellipticity, c = 1 - b/a, where a and b
 are the cluster semimajor and semiminor axes, respec-
 tively, is by Shapley and Sawyer (1927). More recent

 studies of cluster flattening are by Geisler a
 (1980), Frenk and Fall (1982), and Geyer, 
 Nelles(1983).

 eter is sometimes invoked to account for the fact that
 cluster metallicity alone cannot account for the horizon-
 tal-branch population gradients in all clusters (van den
 Bergh 1965; Sandage and Wildey 1967). Since such a
 correlation of ellipticity with a second parameter should
 be with intrinsic rather than with apparent ellipticity it
 seems safest to omit all clusters with Av> 1.0 mag from
 consideration. Data for the 22 clusters with Av < 1.0
 mag, for which both a horizontal-branch population
 gradient (Norris 1983) and an ellipticity value c are
 available, are plotted in Figure 2. The figure shows the
 same absence of flattened clusters with red horizontal
 branches that Norris discovered in a sample that was
 contaminated by highly reddened clusters of uncertain
 intrinsic ellipticity. No cluster in our sample has 4.4 c >
 B/(B + R), in which B and R are the number of blue
 and red horizontal-branch stars. A two-tailed Kolmogo-
 rov-Smirnov test shows that the distribution of c values
 for clusters with B/(B + R) < 0.8 does not differ signifi-
 cantly from that of blue horizontal-branch clusters with
 B/(B + R) > 0.8. The hypothesis that the second pa-
 rameter and cluster ellipticity are physically related
 therefore remains unproven.
 C. Magellanic Cloud Clusters
 One of thè major differences between the Galaxy and
 the Magellanic Clouds is that the galactic globulars all
 have very similar ages (Cannon 1982; VandenBerg 1983),
 whereas populous star clusters in the Clouds exhibit a
 wide age range. A factor contributing to this difference
 is that low-mass dwarf galaxies like the LMC and SMC
 probably accumulated rather gradually, whereas giant
 systems, such as M31 and the Galaxy, are believed to
 have collapsed rapidly (Eggen, Lynden-Bell, and Sand-
 age 1962) from massive protogalaxies. Another striking
 difference between star clusters in the Galaxy and the

 On the other hand the correlation between LMC cluster
 flattening and age is not significant after the dependence
 of ellipticity on cluster luminosity is first removed.
 These results strongly suggest that the correlation be-
 tween cluster luminosity (or mass) and age (see Fig. 4) is
 statistically, and hence presumably physically, significant
 whereas that between age and flattening is not. This con-
 clusion is, perhaps, not surprising because casual in-
 spection of young Galactic open clusters show that they
 are usually not noticeably flattened, i.e., there is no in-
 dication that Galactic clusters are flattened when they
 form and that they subsequently become more spherical
 as they age and lose angular momentum.
 D. Flattening of Clusters In Other Galaxies
 The fact that w Centauri (Mv = - 10.3) is both the
 most luminous and the intrinsically most-flattened Galac-
 tic globular indicates that the transition between mainly
 spherical and flattened clusters takes place near Mv «
 - 10 in the Galaxy compared to Mv « -6 in the LMC.
 The observation that the brightest old cluster (with Mv
 « -7.6) in the dwarf galaxy NGC 6822 is noticeably

 A. Does the Galaxy Contain Two Cluster Populations?
 King (1962) has shown that the structure of globular
 clusters can be described by two parameters; a core radi-
 us rc and an externally imposed tidal radius rt. Figure 5
 shows that the observed frequency distribution of rc val-
 ues (van den Bergh 1983fo) can be adequately represent-
 ed by the relation

 -9.6 and the "Palomar clusters" with Mv « -5. Van
 den Bergh (1983&) shows that there is only an ~ 1% prob-
 ability that the luminosity functions of galactic globular
 clusters with r c < 3 pc and rc > 3 pc were drawn from
 the same parent populations. This result suggests that
 the globular clusters in the Galactic halo may belong to
 two distinct populations which have had different evolu-
 tionary histories. Evidence for a similar phenomenon in
 M31 is provided by recent CFHT observations of the
 clusters in the Andromeda nebula by Crampton et al.
 (1984). Their results (see Fig. 7) show a similar difference
 between the luminosity functions of M31 clusters with
 small and large core radii. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 shows that the probability that the M31 clusters with rc
 < 3 pc and rc > 3 pc were drawn from a parent popu-
 lation with the same luminosity function is ~ 0.1%. The
 luminosity function of M31 and Galaxy globulars with rc
 < 3 pc does not differ significantly. Similarly a Kol-
 mogorov-Smirnov test shows that the galactic and M 31
 globulars with rc > 3 pc do not have significantly differ-
 ent luminosity functions.
 In section IILB it will be shown that cluster core radii
 rc in M31 correlate (r = 0.38) with projected galacto-
 centric distance Dp. Furthermore, observations of 315
 old red clusters in M31 show that there is a moderate
 correlation (r = 0.47) between galactocentric distance
 Dp and cluster luminosity M F. One might therefore ask if
 these relations can account for the strength of the ob-
 served correlation (r = 0.23) between Mv and rc. The an-

 swer is that they can. Using semipartial correlation
 coefficients Morbey (1984) finds that the correlation
 coefficient between Mv and rc is r = 0.06 ± 0.05 after
 the variance that Dp has in common with rc is first re-
 moved. This result implies that the correlation between
 My and rc alone is not statistically significant.
 B. Dependence of Cluster Radii on Distance from Galac-
 tic Nuclei
 Figure 8 shows a plot of the core radii of globular
 clusters as a function of distance from the galactic cen-
 ter. This figure, and the data in Table I, show that mean
 cluster radii increase with distance from the center of
 the Galaxy. Figure 9 shows a similar trend for the M 31
 cluster sample studied by Crampton et al. (1984). To de-
 rive rc from their CFHT "grens" (grating + lens) plates
 Crampton et al. assumed a King (1962) model with rt/rc
 = 30 for the clusters in M31. It should, of course, be
 emphasized that these radii are quite uncertain because
 the core radii of M31 clusters are comparable to the size
 of the seeing disk. Finally Hesser et al. (1984) have found
 that the diameters of clusters in the giant elliptical gal-
 axy NGC 5128 also increase with distance from the cen-
 ter of that object.
 In summary, it appears that all three globular-cluster
 systems that have so far been studied in detail exhibit
 similar increases of cluster size with distance from the
 centers of their parent galaxies. This is so despite the fact
 that NGC 5128 (Ep), M31 (Sb), and the Galaxy (Sbc)

 IV. Globular Clust
 A globular-cluster sy
 tal number N of clusters that it contains. Since the total
 cluster population might be expected to scale with par-
 ent galaxy luminosity a more significant number is the
 specific globular cluster frequency S defined by
 S = N 1004 <15 + *»> , (2)
 i.e., S is the number of globulars per unit luminosity (Mv
 = - 15) of the parent galaxy.
 In distant galaxies, such as those in the Virgo cluster,
 only the bright tail of the cluster luminosity function
 sticks up above the plate limit. The total number of clus-
 ters N therefore has to be determined from the observed
 excess "star" count 2Vobs near the parent galaxy, the as-
 sumed galaxy distance, and the adopted cluster luminos-
 ity function (Harris 1983&). Within reasonable limits the
 specific cluster frequency is rather insensitive to the
 adopted galaxy distance (Harris and van den Bergh
 1981). This is so because an underestimate of the galaxy
 distance will result both in an underestimate of the total
 cluster population and in an underestimate of the galaxy

 luminosity thus leaving S approximately unchanged.
 Harris and Racine (1979) and Racine and Shara (1979)
 have shown that the global luminosity function of globu-
 lar clusters in the Galaxy and in M31 is roughly Gaussian
 with Mv « -7.5 and a = 1.2 mag. Such a luminos-
 ity function also appears to fit the bright end of the
 luminosity functions of the globular clusters associated
 with giant elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster (Hanes
 1977). The fact that the luminosity function of globular
 clusters in M31 seems to depend somewhat on galacto-
 centric distance (see §111) does, however, suggest that the
 cluster luminosity function may be somewhat sensitive to
 the physical conditions prevailing at the time of cluster
 formation. It is therefore possible that some of the ap-
 parent differences in S values that will be discussed be-
 low are, in fact, the result of galaxy-to-galaxy variations
 in the luminosity function of globular clusters.
 Recent observations of the specific globular cluster
 frequency in elliptical and in spiral galaxies are given in
 Harris and van den Bergh (1981) and in van den Bergh
 and Harris (1982), respectively. These observations are

 GLOBULAR CLUSTERS AND GALAXY HALOS 335
 summarized in Harris (1981) and van den Bergh (1982&).
 The results that have been obtained to date are summa-
 rized below.
 A. Elliptical and SO Galaxies
 1. Over a galaxian luminosity range > 103 the specif-
 ic globular cluster frequency S of elliptical galaxies is
 found to be independent of parent galaxy luminosity.
 This result was already evident in the earlier data of
 Harris and Racine (1979). The anomalous S values of
 central galaxies in rich clusters are discussed in section
 IV D.
 2. There is no obvious dependence of the specific
 globular cluster frequency on the ellipticity of E
 galaxies.
 3. There is marginal evidence (Harris 1981; van den
 Bergh 1982&) suggesting that the specific globular clus-
 ter frequency in Virgo ellipticals (<S) = 6.6 ± 0.5) may
 be greater than it is in small clusters «S> = 4.9 ± 0.9)
 and in the Local Group «S> = 3.1 ± 1.2).
 B. Lenticular Galaxies
 Adopting the galaxy classifications of Sandage and
 Tammann (1981) there appears to be no significant dif-
 ference between eleven ellipticals ((S) = 5.0 ± 0.7)
 and seven SO galaxies «S> = 5.3 ± 0.6). (The central
 Virgo cluster galaxy M 87 and the Fornax dwarf sphe-
 roidal system were excluded from the E sample.)
 C. Spiral Galaxies
 Only a limited amount of information is presently
 available on the globular-cluster systems associated with
 spiral galaxies. These data, which are summarized in
 Table II, indicate that the specific cluster frequency in
 late-type spirals is lower than it is in objects of early

 Hubble type. Harris, Harris, and Harris (1983) have used
 these results to conclude that the spheroidal population
 component in spirals has a lower specific frequency S
 than it does in elliptical and SO galaxies. More data will
 be required to establish this conclusion beyond reason-
 able doubt. Such evidence will, however, be difficult to
 obtain because open clusters can only be distinguished
 from globulars in an unambiguous fashion in edge-on or
 nearly edge-on spirals. Even in M 31, in which i - 11°,
 discrimination between globular clusters and old open
 clusters is poor.
 According to de Vaucouleurs and Pence (1978), the
 Galaxy has Mv = -20.6. Combining this value with an
 estimated total galactic globular cluster population N «
 150 yields S « 0.9. For their Galaxy models, de Vaucou-
 leurs and Pence find that the spheroidal population com-
 ponent of the Galaxy has - 19.8 < Mv (sph) < - 19.4
 yielding 1.8 < S (sph) < 2.6. Tammann (1981) obtains a
 Galaxy luminosity that is 0.9 mag brighter than that esti-
 mated by de Vaucouleurs and Pence. The corresponding
 S values are therefore 2.3 times lower than those quoted
 above. // Tammann's magnitude estimate is correct, the
 spheroidal population component of the Galaxy has a
 lower S value than any E galaxy so far studied except
 M 32 (from which globulars may have been tidally
 stripped by M31).
 D. Globulars in Central Galaxies of Rich Clusters
 It has been known for many years that M 87 =
 NGC 4486, which is located near the bottom of the Vir-
 go potential well (van den Bergh 1977), has an unusually
 large globular-cluster population. From compilations by
 Harris (1981) and van den Bergh (1982b) it is seen that
 M87, with S = 18.2 ± 4.5, has a specific cluster fre-
 quency that is three times higher than that of the aver-
 age Virgo elliptical. It is of particular interest to note
 that M49 = NGC 4472, which is the most luminous gal-
 axy in the Virgo cluster, has S = 6.1 ± 1.5. This value is
 closer to the cluster mean value (S = 6.6 ± 0.5) for the
 Virgo ellipticals.
 Recent observations by Harris, Smith, and Myra
 (1982) show that NGC 3311, which is a D galaxy located
 near the bottom of the potential well of the Hydra I
 cluster (Smyth 1983; Richter, Huchtmeier, and Materne
 1983), also has a much higher S value than do the other
 early-type galaxies in this cluster.
 Finally, Dawe and Dickins (1976) have found that
 NGC 1399, which is the central galaxy in the Fornax I
 cluster, is particularly rich in clusters on an AAT plate
 that they have obtained. This conclusion is confirmed by
 inspection of the Fornax cluster on the SRC Sky Survey
 negative.
 It would clearly be of great interest to strengthen and
 confirm the conclusion that central galaxies in rich clus-
 ters are globular cluster-rich by observations of other

 rich clusters. Using CCD detectors, it might even be pos-
 sible to check whether the nearest cD galaxies are also
 super cluster-rich.
 Forte, Martinez, and Muzzio (1982) have suggested
 that the anomalously large cluster population of M 87 is
 due to the capture of globulars from other Virgo cluster
 galaxies. This conclusion appears improbable for a num
 ber of reasons:
 1. According to Harris and Racine (1979), M 87 con-
 tains at least 15,000 globulars. This represents an excess
 of ~ 10,000 clusters over the number that M 87 would
 have had if its specific cluster frequency had been nor-
 mal. If the other cluster galaxies had been stripped of
 this many clusters, they should have below-average S
 values. This is contrary to observations (see §IVA, 3)
 which show that Virgo ellipticals appear to have a high-
 er specific globular cluster frequency than do E galaxies
 that are located outside the Virgo cluster. Furthermore,
 one would not expect the central Galaxy to capture
 stripped globulars with anything like 100% efficiency.
 2. Harris (1983a) has argued that M 87 globulars were
 probably formed in situ rather than acquired because
 they are bluer than the halo of their parent galaxy by the
 same amounts in (B- V) and (U-B) as the globulars sur
 rounding Local Group galaxies and other Virgo
 ellipticals.
 3. Globular clusters will preferentially be stripped
 from the outer regions of Virgo galaxies. Such clusters
 that are detached from the outer halos of other galaxies
 might be expected to be quite metal-poor because: (1)
 the stripped galaxies will be less luminous than the
 stripping galaxy (mean cluster metallicity correlates with
 parent galaxy luminosity) and (2) Virgo galaxies may
 have a radial cluster composition gradient similar to that
 observed in the Galaxy. These expectations seem to con-
 flict with observations by Racine, Oke, and Searle (1978)
 and by Brodie and Hanes (1981) which appear to in-
 dicate that the most-luminous M 87 globulars are, in fact,
 quite metal-rich. It would be important to strengthen
 and confirm this conclusion by means of CCD color ob-
 servations of fainter globular clusters associated with
 M87.
 4. Central cluster galaxies (and cD galaxies in particu-
 lar) are thought to have grown by cannibalism and/or
 mergers. Since normal cluster galaxies have a much
 lower specific globular cluster frequency than central
 galaxies such mergers will reduce the S values of the cen-
 tral galaxies. The specific globular cluster frequencies of
 central cluster galaxies must therefore have been even
 greater originally than they are at present. In view of
 the arguments given above, it appears probable that cen-
 tral galaxies in rich clusters were special ab initio. This
 suggests that such central galaxies may have been kernels
 around which rich clusters formed (van den Bergh
 1983c,d).
 5. On the capture hypothesis it might be difficult to
 account for the observation (Harris and Smith 1976) that
 the major axis of the M 87 cluster system coincides with
 that of M87 itself.
 E. Galaxy Mergers
 It has sometimes been suggested (e.g., Efstathiou and
 Jones 1980) that E galaxies were formed by merging of
 disk systems. Some fundamental difficulties with this
 idea have already been pointed out by Ostriker (1980)
 and Tremarne (1981). Since globular clusters will survive
 mergers a powerful constraint on merger models is pro-
 vided by the specific cluster frequencies observed in el-
 lipticals and spirals.
 At present, data are only available on the specific
 globular cluster frequencies in twelve galaxies which, ac-
 cording to Sandage and Tammann (1981), are true ellip-
 ticals. After excluding M 87 the remaining eleven E gal-
 axies have (S) = 5.0 ± 0.7. For the five spirals listed in
 Table II <S> = 1.8. Two of the objects included in this
 mean (NGC 4594 and NGC 4596) are, however, early-
 type spirals in which the total light is dominated by the
 central bulge. For the three remaining disk-dominated
 systems <S> = 0.2. This value would eventually increase
 to (S) « 0.4 if all gas were removed during a collision
 resulting in the disappearance of all young and inter-
 mediate-age Population I stars. This value is an order of
 magnitude lower than that observed in E galaxies. It fol-
 lows that either (1) ellipticals are not formed by merging
 disk systems or (2) most globular clusters in ellipticals
 are formed when spirals collide and subsequently merge.
 The latter possibly can, however, be excluded by globu-
 lar-cluster color observations. If globulars formed from
 interstellar gas during collisions they would have the
 same composition as the bulk of the interstellar gas, i.e.,
 they would be metal-rich. This conflicts with globular-
 cluster color observations by Forte, Strom, and Strom
 (1981) which appear to show that globular clusters are
 bluer, and hence presumably metal-poor, compared to
 the halo population of their parent galaxy. The alterna-
 tive suggestion that globular clusters in E galaxies are
 blue because they are young can probably be rejected
 because the large color difference &(U-B) « 0.3 be-
 tween globulars and galaxy halos would require the clus-
 ters in most Virgo ellipticals to have formed quite re-
 cently. By this time the velocity dispersion of cluster gal-
 axies has become too large for mergers to be important.
 It is therefore concluded that E galaxies could not have
 been made by merging disk systems with properties sim-
 ilar to those of typical spiral galaxies existing at the pres-
 ent epoch.
 From the discussion given above it is clear that accu-
 rate new CCD observations of the colors of globular
 clusters associated with M 87 and with other Virgo clus-
 ter galaxies could place interesting constraints on both

 GLOBULAR CLUSTERS AND GALAXY HALOS 337
 the capture hypothesis and on chemical evolution
 scenarios.
 It is sometimes suggested that giant spiral galaxies
 such as the Galaxy formed from the merger of ancestral
 systems resembling the Magellanic Clouds. Some of the
 arguments against this view are given below:
 In the Galaxy no clusters with very small core radii
 are found at D > 20 kpc. The absence of such compact
 clusters at large galactocentric distances is significant be-
 cause such objects would, if they ever existed, have sur-
 vived to the present day. The observation that compact
 clusters only exist in the inner part of the Galaxy is diffi-
 cult to understand on scenarios in which the Galaxy
 formed by coalescence of many smaller ancestral galax-
 ies, each of which originally had its own cluster system.
 An additional argument against the view that most giant
 galaxies formed by merger from ancestral dwarfs is pro-
 vided by the observation (see §11) that the Galaxy con-
 tains no highly flattened globular clusters other than <o
 Centauri. Such objects might have been expected if the
 Galaxy formed by merger of ancestral dwarf galaxies
 similar to the Magellanic Clouds.
 The radial gradient in the average metal abundance of
 Galactic globular clusters, and hints of similar gradients
 in the M31 and NGC 5128 cluster systems, also favor the
 idea that globular clusters were formed in the halos of
 individual large protogalaxies. This is so because mergers
 of galaxies with low central concentrations weakens
 gradients (White 1980). Similar arguments apply to the
 radial gradients in cluster radii and cluster luminosity
 functions that are observed in these three systems. Such
 gradients are difficult to understand in the merger pic-
 ture but do, however, receive a natural explanation in
 protogalactic collapse models of the type advocated by
 Eggen et al. (1962).
 Finally, a merger of the Galaxy with a Magellanic-
 type dwarf galaxy during the last few billion years can
 be excluded because carbon stars, which are ubiquitous
 in the LMC and SMC, are rare in the galactic halo. Ref-
 erences to a handful of such carbon stars in the galactic
 halo are given by Margon et al. (1984).
 V. Summary and Conclusions
 From the rather limited data sample that has so far
 been studied there appears to be a critical luminosity
 M*, above which star clusters are noticeably flattened.
 For the LMC (and less certainly for the SMC and
 NGC 6822) M° appears to be fainter by a factor of ~ 40
 than it is in M31 and the Galaxy.
 The observation that Galactic globulars are pre-
 dominantly spherical, whereas those in the Clouds are
 flattened, shows that the Galaxy cannot have been
 formed by merger of ancestral galaxies of Magellanic
 type. The observation that the globulars in the Fornax
 dwarf are nearly spherical suggests that dwarf spheroidal
 galaxies were not formed by sweeping gas from dwarf ir-
 regulars. (The high specific globular cluster frequency in
 Fornax also favors a distinctive mode of formation for
 such objects.)
 The fact that most bright clusters of all ages in the
 LMC are flattened, whereas those in the Galaxy are not,
 indicates that there is some fundamental - but not yet
 understood - difference between the cluster-forming
 processes in the Galaxy and in the LMC.
 For Galactic globular clusters a strong dependence of
 the luminosity function on cluster core radius has been
 found. A similar dependence of luminosity function on
 cluster radius in M31 has recently been discovered by
 Crampton et al. (1984). These results strongly suggest
 that the luminosity function of globular clusters may de-
 pend on physical conditions in the cluster-forming re-
 gion. If so, it may be unsafe to use cluster luminosities to
 derive galaxy distances.
 To a first approximation the number of globular clus-
 ters in E and SO galaxies is proportional to parent galaxy
 luminosity. This result holds true over a range of more
 than one thousand in parent galaxy luminosity. There
 are, however, some real galaxy-to-galaxy differences in
 the specific globular-cluster frequency. Such differences
 show up most clearly when different Virgo cluster ellip-
 ticals are intercompared.
 The central galaxies in the Virgo, Hydra I, and Fornax
 clusters all exhibit unusually high specific globular clus-
 ter frequencies. A number of arguments suggest that this
 frequency is not due to cluster capture by central galax-
 ies. This indicates that the central galaxies in rich clus-
 ters are already different from normal ellipticals very
 early in their evolutionary history. This result is contrary
 to what might have been expected from hierarchical
 clustering models.
 The specific globular cluster frequency is found to de-
 crease rapidly along the sequence Sa-Sb-Sc. There is
 also marginal evidence indicating that the specific clus-
 ter frequency is lower (by a factor of ~ 2) in the bulges
 of spirals than it is in ellipticals. Destruction of clusters
 by disk shocks might account for part of this effect.
 Finally, the specific globular-cluster frequency in disk-
 dominated galaxies is an order of magnitude lower than
 it is in ellipticals. This result is inconsistent with the hy-
 pothesis that typical E galaxies are formed by the merg-
 er of galaxies similar to present-day spirals.
 I should like to take this opportunity to thank Jim
 Hesser for advice and encouragement, John Kormendy
 for various comments, David Crampton for data on the
 radii of the globular clusters in M 31, and Christopher
 Morbey for some of the statistical computations used in
 this review. I also thank Joanne Mills for typing numer-
 ous drafts of this review.
