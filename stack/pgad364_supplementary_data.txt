Data
We consider all networks from the Netzschleuder repository Ref. [30] in the
main manuscript(accessed Aug. 2022) which belong to one of 5 common do-
mains (Online Social, Economic, Technological, Biological, Informational) and
satisfy the following constraints: 1) number of nodes in the largest connected
component is between 50 and 20, 000; 2) not bipartite; and 3) not multilayer
and no multiple types of edges. For the list of all networks see Table. S1.
In order to allow the systematic application of the different community-
detection methods, we removed all self-loops and we consider only the largest
connected component of the network. We found 52 networks with 26 undirected
graphs and 26 directed graphs.
The data for our first case study in Sec. 4 is from Ref. [27]1 and corresponds to
polblogs in the Netzschleuder repository. The data for the second case study in
Sec. 4 was obtained from the online platform Twitter by (i) collecting all tweets
containing the word ‘climate’ between November 2019 to June 2020, and coming
from accounts with Australia specific locations in the user location metadata;
(ii) identifying the top 100 most retweeted tweets each day during this period;
(iii) capturing the user timelines for the authors of these daily top 100 most
retweeted tweets; and (iv) keeping only retweets in these top-user timelines that
retweet other top users. The resulting retweet network consists of 4,029 nodes
representing the top users and 429,235 directed edges representing retweets of
one top user by another top user (multi-edges are kept). The classification of
these users was based on the manual classification of individual tweets performed
in Ref. [28], where the classification of the tweet is attributed to the user. This
data is available in our repository Ref. [33].

Community detection methods
The five community-detection methods we apply to each network g were chosen
to represent different approaches used in this area:
(i) Modularity-based methods search for partitions of g which maximize a
quality function (the modularity) which favours groups of densely con-
nected nodes. Here we use Louvain with the implementation available in
Ref. [9,35].
(ii) Spectral approaches are based on spectra of matrices that represent the
network and can often be seen as a minimization on the number of edges
between groups. Here we use the version of spectral clustering based on the
Bethe-Hessian matrix for heterogeneous graphs available at Ref. [31,38].
(iii) A probabilistic approach based on statistical inference can be obtained
using Stochastic Block Models (SBM) as the random-graph generative
process Ref. [24,25,26,34].Here we use the degree corrected SBM available
in Ref.[36].
(iv) Dynamical processes that take place on networks provide an alternative
approach to partition nodes into groups. We use the most popular ap-
proach, Infomap Ref. [11]., with the implementation available in Ref.[37].
3

(v) Deep-learning methods are increasingly being applied to the community-
detection problem, in combination with a variety of approaches Ref. [5]
Here we use the popular DNGR method for learning graph representations,
as proposed in Ref. [32] and implemented in Ref. [39]. This method can be
used to partition nodes into groups, as considered here, using an additional
clustering method. We use k-means as in Ref. [32], with a specified number
of communities. In the main text we show results for B = 10, similar
results are obtained for different B’s (see SM-Sec. S5 below).
The implementation of these five methods is available also in our repository
Ref. [33].

Community Structure Statistics
Consider a B × B edge density matrix ω obtained applying a community-
detection method to a network g.
The MB×B interaction classification ma-
trix of ω contains the community structure type τ of all pairs of commu-
nities r, s ∈[0, B], with τ ∈{“Assortative”, “Core-Periphery”, “Disassorta-
tive”, “Source-Basin”}, obtained using the classification introduced in Fig. 2
and Eqs. (3)-(4). The fraction of τ of a network g is then given by counting
how often τ appears in M as
Pτ =
1
B(B −1)
X
r̸=s
δτ,Mr,s,
(1)
where δx,y = 1 if x = y and δx,y = 0 if x ̸= 0.
Knowing Pτ for all structure types τ in a network g, we define the dominant
type τd as the τ with largest Pτ and occurring types τo as the set of τ’s with
Pτ > 0. We then compute the dominance of each type τ over a set of networks
g as the fraction of networks that has dominant type τd = τ as
Dominance(τ) = 1
|g|
X
g
δτ,τd,
(2)
where |g| is the number of networks in g. Similarly, the occurrence of type τ is
computed as the fraction of networks in which τ occurs (τ ∈τo) as
Occurrence(τ) = 1
|g|
X
g

τ ′∈τo
δτ,τ ′.
(3)
In the results reported in this paper we applied the analysis above only to
communities with more than 5 nodes, Nr > 5, because small communities play
a minor role in explaining the properties of the network and the classification
of their structure types τ is often not robust (when applying the tests reported
in Sec. S4 below).

Robustness Estimation
We test the statistical robustness of our classification of communities in types
by (1) comparing to a null model and (2) considering small perturbations of the
underlying network.
S4.1
Null model
We consider a null model of random density matrix ωnull to assess the signifi-
cance of the results we obtained applying our pairwise classification of commu-
nity types to ω. Since our pairwise classification depends only on the ranking
order of the entries in ω, we build ωnull as a random B × B matrix with en-
tries from 1 to B2. We then apply our classification – defined in Fig. 2 of the
manuscript – to obtain the interaction classification matrix M null, the structure
type fraction P null
τ
from Eqs. (5), and the dominant type τ null

and occurring
types τ null
o
– from Eqs. (6) and (7) of the manuscript– for the null model. The
result obtained from this analysis represent our random expectation for an ar-
bitrary partition of the network g in B communities. We further propose a
statistic over many networks g by generating null models for each g with the
same B obtained in the original analysis. This method is summarized in Al-
gorithm 1. The dominance and occurrence obtained using this null model are
reported in Fig. 4 of the paper.

S4.2
Robustness of categorical classification
Our community structure classification is computed for a given partition of the
network. In practice, small variations of the network or algorithms (e.g., the
initialization of optimization steps) may result in (slightly) different partitions.
To have a better understanding of the robustness of our classification and results
to such variations, we introduce a bootstrapping method for estimating the
uncertainty of the results obtained from our classification.
Given a certain graph g (with N nodes and E edges) and partition p with
its corresponding pairwise community classification matrix M, we first rewire
the graph by randomly choosing E edges (with replacement) from the edge list
of g. We denote this generated graph g′. Then we compute the density matrix

1: Create a rewiring graph g′
2: Compute density matrix ω′
3: Get M ′ using classification in Eqs. (3) or (4)

5: Calculate certainty Prs from Eqs. (S4)

We applied this analysis in several cases and confirmed that our main conclusions
remain unchanged. In particular, for the two case studies reported in Sec. 4,
we find that all classifications for B = 5 lead to Prs > 0.99 except for one
core-periphery classification in the blogs network which had Pr,s = 0.86 (see
Fig. S2).

consider an intermediate quantity – denoted proportional occurrence – to mea-

dicate the community densities ωr,s.
The blocks b = 0, 1, . . . , 4 are ranked
according to community size Nr = {354, 291, 291, 210, 76}(left) and Nr =
{1473, 1031, 956, 563}(right) from community 0 to community 4(left)/3(right).
As noted in the main text, the edge direction of the political blogs network is
reversed when compared to the original dataset in order to fit the convention
used in our text. The labels in each entry of the matrix correspond to the struc-
ture type τ and robustness score obtained from Eqs.(8) (see Sec. S4, Algorithm
2), where “A” stands for “Assortative”, “CP” stands for “Core-Periphery”, “D”
stands for “Disassortative” and “SB” stands for “Source-Basin”. Left: Commu-
nity 0 and 3 are in a Source-Basin relationship. Communities 4 and 2 are in a
Core-Periphery relationship and communities 2 and 1 are in a Core-Periphery
relationship (i.e., community 2 is a periphery in respect to 4 and core in respect
to 1). Right: Community 0,1,2 are climate change supporter groups. Commu-
nity 0 and 2 are in a Source-Basin relationship.

appearance of a type τ or in the most dominant type τ, here we focus on the frac-
tion Pτ of pairs of a given type τ in each network. For each community structure

we average the fraction Pτ over a set of networks as

This section shows additional analyses of our survey results. The results
obtained in our survey using the proportional occurrence method are shown in

Fig. S4. Finally, the results obtained using the DNGR method with different
number of communities B are shown in Fig. S5.

Results for three pre-defined number of

Overall, the results with different B
suggest an increasing occurrence of non-assortative structures and an increasing
dominance (and proportional occurrence) of Assortative structure as B grows.
