Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) convert predominantly infrared wavelength light to 
electricity via the photovoltaic effect, and can enable approaches to energy storage1,2 
and conversion3–9 that use higher temperature heat sources than the turbines that are 
ubiquitous in electricity production today. Since the first demonstration of 29% 
efficient TPVs (Fig. 1a) using an integrated back surface reflector and a tungsten 
emitter at 2,000 °C (ref. 10), TPV fabrication and performance have improved11,12. 
However, despite predictions that TPV efficiencies can exceed 50% (refs. 11,13,14), the 
demonstrated efficiencies are still only as high as 32%, albeit at much lower 
temperatures below 1,300 °C (refs. 13–15). Here we report the fabrication and 
measurement of TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40% and experimentally 
demonstrate the efficiency of high-bandgap tandem TPV cells. The TPV cells are 
two-junction devices comprising III–V materials with bandgaps between 1.0 and 1.4 eV 
that are optimized for emitter temperatures of 1,900–2,400 °C. The cells exploit the 
concept of band-edge spectral filtering to obtain high efficiency, using highly 
reflective back surface reflectors to reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the 
emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 ± 1)% operating at a 
power density of 2.39 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. A 1.2/1.0 eV 
device reached a maximum efficiency of (39.3 ± 1)% operating at a power density of 
1.8 W cm–2 and an emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. These cells can be integrated into a 
TPV system for thermal energy grid storage to enable dispatchable renewable energy. 
This creates a pathway for thermal energy grid storage to reach sufficiently high 
efficiency and sufficiently low cost to enable decarbonization of the electricity grid.
Here we report TPV efficiency measurements of more than 40%, deter-
mined by simultaneous measurement of electric power output and heat 
dissipation from the device by calorimetry. This record  experimental 
demonstration of TPV efficiency was enabled by (1) the usage of higher 
bandgap materials in combination with emitter temperatures between 
1,900 and 2,400 °C, (2) high-performance multi-junction architectures 
with bandgap tunability enabled by high-quality metamorphic epitaxy16 
and (3) the integration of a highly reflective back surface reflector (BSR) 
for band-edge filtering11,13.
The cells are 1.4/1.2 eV and 1.2/1.0 eV tandem devices optimized for 
the 1,900–2,400 °C emitter temperature range (Fig. 1) for the thermal 
energy grid storage (TEGS) application1,17. TEGS is a low-cost, grid-scale 
energy storage technology that uses TPVs to convert heat to electricity 
above 2,000 °C, which is a regime inaccessible to turbines. It is a battery 
that takes in electricity, converts it to high-temperature heat, stores 
the heat and then converts it back to electricity by TPVs on demand. 
Although TEGS was initially conceived with a molten silicon storage 
medium18, a graphite storage medium is even lower cost (US$0.5 per kg),  
and the projected capital cost per unit energy (CPE) is less than 
US$10 per kWh (ref. 19). This cost is so low, it would enable TEGS to 
meet the proposed cost targets (<US$20 per kWh) for long-duration 
energy storage that would allow renewable energy with storage to be 
cost-competitive with fossil fuels20–22. As a result, the proliferation of 
TEGS could ultimately enable abatement of approximately 40% of 
global CO2 emissions, by decarbonizing the electricity grid (approxi-
mately 25% of emissions) and then enabling CO2-free electricity to 
charge vehicles in the transportation sector (approximately 15% of 
emissions)23. Reaching a TPV efficiency of 40% is notable, because it 
means that TEGS, as well as a range of other potential applications, are 
now feasible. These applications include other energy storage technolo-
gies2, natural gas, propane or hydrogen-fuelled power generation3–9, 
and high-temperature industrial waste heat recovery (Methods and 
Extended Data Fig. 1).
High-efficiency TPV cells
The efficiency of a TPV cell is defined differently from that of a solar 
cell because, unlike a solar cell, a TPV system can preserve and later 
convert the energy in sub-bandgap photons. This is because, in the 
contexts in which TPV is envisioned to be used, the TPV cell has a high 
view factor to the emitter. This means that sub-bandgap photons 
can be reflected back to the emitter by the TPV cell (Fig. 1b), which 
is different from a solar cell and the sun. By reflecting unconverted 
photons, the energy of the sub-bandgap light is preserved through 
reabsorption by the emitter. The reflected and subsequently reab-
sorbed light helps to keep the emitter hot, thereby minimizing the

tion (1), to increase TPV efficiency, one must increase the power output 
Pout and/or reduce the amount of heat absorbed and generated in the 
cell (Qc). The efficiency, ηTPV, is the metric we use here because it is the 
conventional and generalizable metric used to describe the performance 
of a cell–emitter pair independent of other system-level characteristics12. 
The efficiency of a full system involving TPVs may be less than ηTPV due 
to system-specific losses. However, these system-level losses can become 
negligible in the case of TEGS or a large-scale combustion-based electric-
ity generation system1,24 (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1).
The high emitter temperatures targeted here for TEGS and other 
applications allow higher bandgap cells of at least 1.0 eV to be used 
instead of the low-bandgap, InGaAs- or GaSb-based cells tradition-
ally used for TPV. This is key, because the spectrum of light redshifts 
towards longer wavelengths as the radiator temperature is lowered, 
which is why traditional TPV cells that are paired with emitters of less 
than 1,300 °C are typically based on 0.74 eV InGaAs or 0.73 eV GaSb. 
Considerable work on low-bandgap semiconductors has been under-
taken with the envisioned application of converting heat from natural 
gas combustion3–9, concentrated solar power24, space power applica-
tions25,26 and, more recently, energy storage1,2,27. This pioneering body of 
work has led to the identification of three key features that now enable 
TPVs to become a competitive option for converting heat to electric-
ity commercially: high-bandgap materials paired with high emitter 
temperatures, high-performance multi-junction architectures with 
bandgap tunability enabled by high-quality metamorphic epitaxy16 
and the integration of a high-reflectivity BSR for band-edge filtering11,13.
With respect to higher bandgaps, they increase efficiency because 
there is an almost constant penalty on voltage of around 0.3–0.4 V, due 
to the thermodynamic requirements on the radiative recombination 
rate28. As a result, this unavoidable loss penalizes lower bandgap cells 
more than higher bandgap cells, because this loss makes up a smaller 
fraction of the voltage for higher bandgap materials. Using higher 
bandgap materials also needs to be accompanied by operation at higher 
temperatures to maintain sufficiently high power density, which scales

with the emitter temperature to the fourth power. Operation at high 
power density is critical for TPV economics because the cell costs scale 
with their area, and if the power generation per unit area increases, the 
corresponding cost per unit power (CPP) decreases29.
With respect to BSRs, a highly reflective BSR is critical to minimize 
Qc. Highly reflective BSRs provide the additional benefit of boosting 
open-circuit voltage, because they also improve recycling of lumines-
cent photons generated by radiative recombination30–32. This effect 
has led to regular integration of BSRs with solar PV cells, which provides 
a template for their use in TPVs. With these important lessons from 
previous work in mind, the cells developed here are 1.2/1.0 eV and 
1.4/1.2 eV two-junction designs intended for the TEGS application with 
emitter temperatures between 1,900 and 2,400 °C (ref. 1). Multi-junction 
cells increase efficiency over single junctions by reducing hot carrier 
thermalization losses and reducing resistive losses by operating at a 
lower current density. The cells were based on the inverted metamor-
phic multi-junction architecture pioneered at the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (NREL)33–35.
The first cell design uses lattice-mismatched 1.2 eV AlGaInAs and 1.0 
eV GaInAs top and bottom junctions, where the lattice mismatch is with 
respect to the crystallographic lattice constant of the GaAs substrate 
on which they are grown. The second design uses a lattice-matched 
1.4 eV GaAs top cell and a lattice-mismatched 1.2 eV GaInAs bottom 
cell, taking advantage of the inherently higher material quality of 
lattice-matched epitaxy in the GaAs cell (Fig. 1c, Fig. 1d and Extended 
Data Fig. 2). The lower bandgap 1.2/1.0 eV tandem offers the potential 
for higher power density than the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem because it con-
verts a broader band of the incident spectrum, and consequently the 
requirements on the BSR are less stringent to obtain high efficiency27. 
Higher power density can also be a practical engineering advantage. 
On the other hand, although the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem has a lower power 
output, the reduced current density of this bandgap combination 
potentially enables higher efficiency than the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem if 
resistive losses are an issue.
TPV efficiency measurement results
The TPV cell fabrication, measurement and modelling details are pro-
vided in the Methods. We refer to the two tandems by their bandgaps: 
1.4/1.2 eV and 1.2/1.0 eV. Reflectance measurements are shown in Fig. 2a 
and internal quantum efficiency is given in Fig. 2b. The sub-bandgap 
spectral weighted reflectance for the 2,150 °C blackbody spectrum is 
93.0% for the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem and 93.1% for the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem. 
The 2,150 °C blackbody spectrum shape is shown throughout for refer-
ence, because 2,150 °C is the average emitter temperature in the TEGS 
application and in the measurements. See Extended Data Figs. 4 and 
5a for the measured spectrum and a comparison between the blackbody 
spectrum shape and the spectrum under which the cells were charac-
terized. Current density versus voltage measurements were performed 
under a tungsten halogen bulb emitter and results for a range of emit-
ter temperatures relevant to the TEGS application (approximately 
1,900–2,400 °C) are shown in Fig. 2c, 2d. As expected, the 1.2/1.0 eV 
tandem had lower voltage but higher current density than the 1.4/1.2 eV 
tandem. The non-monotonic change in Voc at the highest emitter tem-
peratures was because of increasing cell temperature (Extended Data 
Fig. 6a) due to the presence of a heat flux sensor (HFS) used for the 
efficiency measurement, that undesirably also impeded heat flow. 
Figure 3a shows the efficiency measurement at the same range of emit-
ter temperatures, which was accomplished by simultaneously measur-
ing Qc and Pout.

The results for the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem showed increasing efficiency 
with increasing emitter temperature, and the efficiency exceeded 40% 
at 2,350 °C, which is within the target range of 1,900–2,400 °C needed 
for the TEGS application. At 2,400 °C, the efficiency was as high as 
41.1 ± 1%, whereas the average efficiency between 1,900 and 2,400 °C 
was 36.2%. The electrical power density was 2.39 W cm–2 at the maxi-
mum emitter temperature of 2,400 °C. The rate of increase of efficiency 
with temperature slowed at high emitter temperatures due to a reduc-
tion in FF, because of increasing series resistance losses and the dimin-
ishing increase in Jsc due to the cell becoming current-limited by the 
bottom cell at approximately 2,250 °C.
The results for the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem showed greater efficiency than 
for the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem at lower emitter temperatures because of its 
lower bandgaps. The efficiency of the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem reached a 
maximum of 39.3 ± 1% at 2,127 °C, quite close to 2,150 °C, which is the 
temperature at which our device model predicted this bandgap com-
bination would be optimal27. The average efficiency between 1,900 and 
2,300 °C was 38.2% and the efficiency remained high across a 400 °C 
range of emitter temperatures. This is particularly worth noting for 
the TEGS application because it indicates consistently high efficiency 
can be achieved even as the emitter temperature varies during the 
discharging process of the TEGS system. The reduction in efficiency 
beyond this temperature was due to the increasing series resistance 
losses and the diminishing increase in Jsc due to the cell becoming 
current-limited by the bottom cell at temperatures greater than 
2,150 °C. The electrical power density was 2.42 W cm–2 at the maximum 
emitter temperature measured of 2,279 °C, and it was 1.81 W cm–2 at 
the maximum efficiency point at the emitter temperature of 2,127 °C. 
Comparing the performance of the two cells across the range of emit-
ter temperatures, they exhibit different characteristics that are advan-
tageous for TEGS. The efficiency of the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem is less 
sensitive to changes in emitter temperature, has a higher electrical 
power density at a given emitter temperature and has a higher efficiency 
averaged over the emitter temperatures. However, the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem 
can reach higher efficiency at the highest emitter temperatures.
Figure 3a also shows model predictions for efficiency and the cor-
responding uncertainty of the model prediction. The good agreement 
obtained between the modelled and measured performance supports 
and validates the accuracy of the efficiency measurement and of the 
calorimetry-based method used to measure efficiency. In addition, the 
good agreement indicates that the model can be extended to extrapo-
late how the performance would change with additional improvements 
or at other operating conditions. The most important TPV cell property 
that could be improved is its spectral-weighted sub-bandgap reflec-
tance, Rsub. Figure 3b shows how the efficiency would change if Rsub 
could be increased. To extrapolate the results to a real TPV system, 
here we assume that the emitter is tungsten (W), as it is in the TEGS 
system, and that the area ratio between the emitter and cell is AR = 1, 
the view factor is VF = 1 and the cell temperature is 25 °C (Extended 
Data Fig. 5). In this prediction, for a 2,200 °C emitter temperature, the 
efficiency of the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem exceeds 50% at R
= 97%
sub
. The rea-
son this is worth noting is because the present value of Rsubis consider-
ably lower than what was achieved with the air bridge approach recently 
demonstrated by Fan et al.15. Their work demonstrating a reflectivity 
of more than 98% charts a pathway towards further efficiency improve-
ments. If the air bridge approach developed by Fan et al. could be com-
bined with the advancements demonstrated here, it could lead to 
efficiencies greater than 56% at 2,250 °C, or greater than 51% averaged 
over the 1,900–2,400 °C temperature range.
Conclusions
We report two-junction TPV cells with efficiencies of more than 40% 
using an emitter with a temperature between 1,900 and 2,400 °C.  
The efficiency of the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem reaches 41.1 ± 1% at 2,400 °C, with 
an average of 36.2% over the target temperature range. The efficiency 
of the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem reaches 39.3 ± 1% and varies very little over a 
wide temperature range with an average efficiency over the 1,900–
2,300 °C temperature range of 38.2%. This high performance is enabled 
by the usage of multi-junction cells with bandgaps of at least 1.0 eV, 
which are higher bandgaps than have been traditionally used in TPVs.  
The higher bandgaps enable the use of higher emitter temperatures, 
which correspond to the temperature range of interest for the low-cost 
TEGS energy storage technology1. This temperature range is also appli-
cable for natural gas or hydrogen combustion, and further demonstra-
tion of integrated systems is warranted.
Reaching 40% efficiency with TPVs is notable from the standpoint 
that it now renders TPV as a heat engine technology that can compete 
with turbines. An efficiency of 40% is already greater than the average 
turbine-based heat engine efficiency in the United States (Fig. 1a)36–38,

but what could make TPVs even more attractive than a turbine is the 
potential for lower cost (CPP < US$0.25 per W)1,24, faster response times, 
lower maintenance, ease of integration with external heat sources and 
fuel flexibility. This is noteworthy  because turbine costs and perfor-
mance have already reached full maturity, so there are limited prospects 
for future improvement, as they are at the end of their development 
curve. TPVs, on the other hand, are very early in their progress down a 
fundamentally different development curve. Consequently, TPVs have 
numerous prospects for both improved efficiency (for example, by 
improving reflectivity and lowering series resistance) and lowering cost 
(for example, by reusing substrates and cheaper feedstocks). Thus, the 
demonstration of 40% efficiency represents an important step towards 
realizing the potential that can be achieved with increased attention 
and funding in the coming years as commercial applications emerge 
and become profitable.

TPV applications
Turbines proliferated because of their high efficiency (25–60%) and 
their low CPP generated (US$0.5–1 per W). However, as turbines intrin-
sically require moving parts, there are corresponding requirements 
on the high-temperature mechanical properties of the materials of 
construction, as they are subject to centrifugal loads. Thus, they have 
reached their practical limits in terms of cost and efficiency, barring 
a materials discovery that would allow them to operate at substan-
tially higher turbine inlet temperatures than the current values of 
approximately 1,500 °C for Brayton cycles and approximately 700 °C 
for Rankine cycles29. Solid-state heat engines such as TPVs, which have 
no moving parts, possess an advantage in this sense, enabling operation 
at significantly higher temperatures than turbines. TPVs can enable 
new approaches to energy storage1,2 and conversion3–9 that use higher 
temperature heat sources.
In this section, we highlight two promising applications for 
high-bandgap tandem TPVs paired with high-temperature heat sources: 
(1) TEGS1 and (2) combustion-driven electricity generation. We also 
discuss the importance of TPV efficiency in relation to the system-level 
efficiency metrics relevant to these applications.
TEGS, which is conceptually illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 1a, takes 
in electricity, converts it to heat by joule heating, stores the heat in a 
bank of large graphite blocks and then converts it back to electricity 
through TPVs. The heat is transferred to different parts of the system 
using mechanically pumped liquid metal tin45 and a graphite infra-
structure, as demonstrated by Amy et al.1,17,18. The blocks store the heat 
and when electricity is desired, the liquid metal retrieves the heat and 
delivers it to a power block containing TPV cells that convert light emit-
ted by the hot infrastructure. For a storage system, the primary effi-
ciency metric is the round trip efficiency (RTE) described by the ratio 
of the output electrical power (Pout) to the input electrical power Pin. 
For TEGS, Pin is primarily the electricity supplied to the resistance heat-
ers, but also includes a contribution from pumping power requirements 
for the liquid tin heat transfer fluid and the heat exchanger for cell 
cooling. The Sankey diagram of the TEGS system is shown in Extended 
Data Fig. 1b.
For any system using TPVs, a subsystem efficiency can be defined  
as the ratio of the electric power output to the energy input to the emit-
ter at steady state, Qh, such that η

h  (Fig. 1b and

factor or convective losses from the emitter or cell, or other heat  
losses from the emitter to the environment (Qloss,subsystem). Therefore,

TPV if Qloss,subsystem,  
which scales with the outer surface area of the power block, is small as 
compared with the energy conversion taking place inside the power 
block, which scales with its volume. This can be accomplished by 
increasing the scale of the system such that the heated material has a 
large volume to surface area ratio, Φ, and heat losses from the surfaces 
can be minimized with proper insulation24, and if the emitter surface 
and TPV module have a large surface area to perimeter ratio such that 
the view factor between them approaches one. This can be the case for 
TEGS or a large-scale combustion system, and it is a critically important 
aspect of achieving a high value for ηTPV,subsystem (refs. 1,24).
To illustrate the importance of Φ, Extended Data Fig. 1a shows a sin-
gle unit cell of the TEGS power block, which is composed of a tungsten 
cavity emitter heated by pumped liquid tin, emitting to an array of TPV 
cells. The nominal dimensions of the TPV array, LTPV, and emitter, Lemit, 
are 10 cm and 40 cm, respectively. The area ratio AR =

 and 
the emitter material is tungsten based on previous optimization1.  
The graphite pipes, which carry the liquid tin heat transfer fluid and 
supply energy to the tungsten emitter surface, are 2 cm in diameter. 
Therefore, the side length of one unit cell of the power block is

= 44cm.

 We note that although fins on the emitter can be used to 
increase the volumetric power density of the system, in this example 
we assume no fins are used for simplicity. In this example, we also 
assume that the depth dimensions of all components are equivalent, 
and that convective losses and view factor losses are negligible.

ronment can be expressed as Q

The value of h is dominated by conduction through the graphite insu-

graphite insulation (k≈1 W m–1 K–1 at 2,150 °C) and Linsulation is the insu-
lation thickness. Although its thermal conductivity is moderate, graph-
ite insulation is the only economical option for insulating systems 
above 1,700 °C (ref. 46). A is the external surface area of the power block, 
Th is the average temperature of the power block (2,150 °C) and T∞ is the 
temperature of the environment (25 °C).
Considering a single unit cell of the dimensions discussed above and 
using tungsten spectral properties and an emitter temperature  
Th = 2,150 °C, our TPV model predicts Pout=11.4 W per cm2 of cell area 
and ηTPV= 40% for the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem. Considering the entire volume 
of the unit cell, this leads to a volumetric electric power density of 
240 kW m–3. Assuming that the power block is a cube, Extended Data 
Fig. 1c shows ηTPV,subsystem as a function of the side length of the power 
block (excluding the insulation) as well as Φ for two different graphite 
insulation thicknesses. The results show that ηTPV,subsystem approaches 
ηTPV for power block length scales of approximately 1 m when the  
system is appropriately insulated. The results also indicate that TPVs 
are well-suited for large-scale systems, as it is challenging to achieve 
high system efficiencies with power block length scales of less than 
1 m. In characterizing the RTE of TEGS (Extended Data Fig. 1b), other 
losses are due to the energy conversion of electricity to heat in the 
resistive heaters (<1%) and heat losses from the thermal storage media 
(approximately 1% per day), but they can be negligibly small1. Therefore, 
the RTE can be dominated by ηTPV.
Here it is important to note that a RTE of 40–55% as is targeted in the 
TEGS application is low as compared to other options, such as Li-ion 
batteries, which have RTEs of more than 70%. However, several studies 
have pointed out that to enable full penetration of renewables onto the 
grid, a one to two order of magnitude decrease in CPE is required, owing 
to the need for long storage durations20–22. It is from this perspective 
that the RTE can be sacrificed, as long as it is above approximately 35% 
(ref. 1), provided it enables accession of much lower cost. Thus, tech-
noeconomic analyses indicate that a technology with a tenfold lower 
CPE, yet a twofold lower efficiency as compared with Li-ion batteries, 
is still more economically attractive1,20–22.
Another promising application for TPVs is electricity generation in 
which the heat source is the combustion of fuel3–9,47. The temperature 
regime examined here is accessible by combustion of natural gas or 
hydrogen, which could be made into an efficient power generation 
system by using recuperators made from refractory metals and 
oxides3,47. Extended Data Figure 1d shows a modular combustion-driven 
TPV concept. Air enters a recuperator and is preheated by exchanging 
heat with the outgoing exhaust. The preheated air mixes with fuel, com-
busts and transfers heat to the emitter wall, which irradiates to the TPVs. 
Here, the important metric is the first-law thermal efficiency defining 
the ratio of net work output to the primary energy input (Extended Data 
Fig. 1e). The net work output is P
P
−
out
in, where Pout is the electric power 
output from the TPVs and Pin is the work input for pumping required 
for gas circulation and the TPV liquid cooling. The primary energy input 
is the higher heating value of the fuel, QHHV. The combustor modules 
are stacked to create an array of length scale of around 1 m (Extended 
Data Fig. 1c), the side walls of each module are adiabatic by symmetry 
and the entire block of modules can be insulated at the outermost edges. 

A TPV panel that is close and opposite the emitter array has an area to 
perimeter ratio that is large and minimizes view-factor losses from the 
edges. Other heat losses can occur through the exhaust because of an 
imperfect recuperator. However, the efficiency at which the chemical 
energy in the fuel, QHHV, is converted to Qh for TPV systems (that is, 
Q
Q
/
h
HHV) can be approximately 90% (ref. 3).
These two examples (TEGS and combustion-driven electricity gen-
eration) illustrate the importance of ηTPV, which dominates system-level 
efficiencies for an appropriately designed system at scale. Assuming 
that the other losses can be made negligible, our work demonstrates 
a solid-state heat engine (terrestrial heat source) with an efficiency 
higher than the average heat engine efficiency in the United States, 
which is lower than 35% based on primary energy inputs and electricity 
output38. An efficiency of 40% is also higher than most steam cycles, 
and is in the same range as simple cycle gas turbines48. Thus, 40% rep-
resents a major step forward (Fig. 1a), as this is a type of heat engine 
that has the potential to compete with turbines by exhibiting compa-
rable efficiency and potentially even lower CPP, for example less than 
$0.25 per W (refs. 1,24). To properly contextualize why this has 
broad-reaching implications, it should be appreciated that over the 
last century a range of alternative heat engines, such as thermoelec-
trics49, thermionics50, TPVs12, thermally regenerative electrochemical 
systems51, thermoacoustic engines52 and Stirling engines53,54, have been 
developed. All these technologies have some intrinsic advantage(s) 
over turbines, such as low maintenance, no moving parts and/or easier 
integration with an external heat source, yet none of them have previ-
ously been able to compete with the efficiency and CPP of turbines for 
large-scale heat to electricity conversion.
TPV cell growth and processing details
Extended Data Figure 2 shows the device structures of the tandem 
cells. All materials were grown by atmospheric pressure organome-
tallic vapour phase epitaxy using trimethylgallium, triethylgallium, 
trimethylindium, triethylaluminium, dimethylhydrazine, arsine and 
phosphine. Diethylzinc and carbon tetrachloride were used as p-type 
dopant sources and hydrogen selenide and dislane were used as n-type 
dopant sources. Growth took place in a purified hydrogen gas flow of 
6 litres per minute. Substrates were n-type (100) GaAs with a 2° offcut 
towards the (111)B plane, and all devices were grown in an inverted 
configuration. For both types of cells, the substrate was prepared by 
first etching in NH4OH:H2O2:H2O (2:1:10 by volume). The substrate 
was then mounted on a graphite susceptor and heated inductively to 
700 °C under an arsine overpressure, followed by an approximately 
10 min deoxidization under arsine.
Growth of the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem started with a 0.2 µm GaAs buffer 
and was then followed by a 0.5 µm GaInP etch stop layer. Then, 0.1 µm 
of GaInAsN:Se and 0.2 µm of GaAs:Se were deposited as the front con-
tact layer. The top cell was grown, starting with a 0.02 µm AlInP win-
dow layer, then a 0.1 GaAs:Se emitter, a 0.1 µm undoped GaAs layer, 
a 2.8 µm GaAs:Zn base layer and a 0.12 µm GaInP back surface field 
(BSF) layer. Next, an AlGaAs:C/GaAs:Se/AlGaAs:Si quantum well tun-
nel junction was grown, followed by a GaInP compositionally graded 
buffer (CGB). The CGB consisted of 0.25 µm GaInP steps spanning the 
compositional range Ga0.51In0.49P to Ga0.34In0.66P at a rate of 1% strain 
per µm, with the final layer being a 1.0 µm Ga0.34In0.66P strain overshoot 
layer. The bottom cell was grown, consisting of a 1.0 µm Ga0.37In0.63 
P window, a 0.1µm Ga0.85In0.15As:Se emitter, a 0.1µm Ga0.85In0.15As i-layer, 
a 1.5 µm Ga0.85In0.15As:Zn base and a 0.05 µm Ga0.37In0.63P:Zn BSF. Finally, 
a 0.05 µm Al0.20Ga0.66In0.14As:Zn++ back contact layer was grown.
For the 1.2/1.0 eV design27, a 0.2 µm GaAs buffer layer was grown 
first, then a GaInP CGB consisting of 0.25 µm GaInP steps, spanning 
the range Ga0.51In0.49P to Ga0.19In0.81P, with the final layers being a 1.0 µm 
Ga0.19In0.81P strain overshoot layer and a 0.9 µm Ga0.22In0.78P step back 
layer lattice matched to the in-plane lattice constant of the Ga0.19In0.81P. 
A 0.3 µm Ga0.70In0.30As:Se front contact layer was grown next, followed 
by the top cell, starting with a 0.02 µm Ga0.22In0.78P:Se window, a 1.0 µm 
Al0.15Ga0.55In0.30As:Se emitter, an undoped 0.1 µm Al0.15Ga0.55In0.30As 
i-layer, a 2.1 µm Al0.15Ga0.55In0.30As:Zn base and a 0.07 µm Ga0.22In0.78P:Zn 
BSF. Then the tunnel junction, comprising a 0.2 µm Al0.15Ga0.55In0.30As:Zn 
layer, a 0.05 µm GaAs0.72Sb0.28:C++ layer and a 0.1 µm Ga0.22In0.78P:Se++ 
layer, was grown. Finally, the bottom cell was grown, comprising a 
0.05 µm Ga0.22In0.78P:Se window, a 1.5 µm Ga0.70In0.30As:Se emitter, a 
0.1 µm Ga0.70In0.30As:Zn i-layer and a 0.02 µm Ga0.22In0.78P:Zn BSF. Finally, 
a 0.05 µm Al0.4Ga0.30In0.30As:Zn++ back contact layer was grown.
After growth, an approximately 2-µm-thick reflective gold back 
contact was electroplated to the exposed back contact layer (the last 
semiconductor layer grown). The samples were bonded with low vis-
cosity epoxy to a silicon handle and the substrates were etched away in 
NH4OH:H2O2 (1:3 by volume). Gold front grids were electroplated to the 
front surfaces through a positive photoresist mask, using a thin layer 
of electroplated nickel as an adhesion layer. The grids were nominally 
10 µm wide, 100 µm apart and at least 5 µm thick. The samples were then 
isolated into individual devices using standard wet-chemical etchants 
and cleaved into single cell chips for characterization. The completed 
cells had mesa areas of 0.8075 cm2, with illuminated areas (discounting 
the single busbar but including the grid fingers) of 0.7145 cm2.
Efficiency measurement
To measure the TPV cell efficiency, we seek direct measurement of the

 and the heat generated in the cell, Qc. To test the cells 
under a well-controlled and relevant spectrum (emission from tungsten 
between 1,900 and 2,400 °C for TEGS), a tungsten halogen lamp was 
used in combination with a concentrator. The concentrator consisted 
of a silver-plated elliptical reflector behind the lamp and a compound 
parabolic reflector (CPC) obtained from Optiforms that further con-
centrated the light onto the cell. At the base of the CPC, a water-cooled 
aluminium aperture plate was suspended above the TPV cell (Extended 
Data Fig. 7). The area of the aperture was 0.312 cm2 and the active area 
of the cell was 0.7145 cm2.
To keep the TPV cell cool it was mounted on a microchannel copper 
heat sink (M2, Mikros) that was water-cooled. To measure Qabs, a HFS, 
model gSKIN XP obtained from greenTEG, was placed between the cell 
and the heat sink. Thermally conductive adhesive tape held the HFS in 
place on the heat sink, and thermal paste provided thermal contact 
between the cell and the HFS. Electrical contact to the cell bus bars was 
accomplished using a pair of copper clips, which were both electrically 
and thermally isolated from the heat sink using a piece of insulation. 
A pair of wires was connected to the bottom of each copper clip to 
perform a four-wire measurement. The bottom side of the aluminium 
aperture plate was shielded with several layers of copper-coated Kap-
ton and aluminium tape acting as a radiation shield to reduce the 
radiative transfer between the aperture plate and the TPV cell.
A d.c. power supply (Magna-Power) provided power to the tungsten 
halogen lamp and the voltage was controlled to achieve the desired 
emitter temperature. The lamp was rated for 5 kW at 3,200 K, but the 
temperature and power were tuned down to the desired emitter tem-
perature by controlling the voltage to the lamp using the power supply. 
The emitter temperature was determined by measuring the resistance 
of the tungsten heating element in the lamp and using published cor-
relations on the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity 
and resistance of tungsten filaments in incandescent lamps55. First, the 
cold resistance of the bulb was measured at the point of the bulb junc-
tion and at the point of contact with the power supply to determine the 
resistance of the electrical leads to the bulb. The hot bulb resistance 
was measured by subtracting the electrical lead resistance from the 
total resistance as determined from the voltage and current input to 
the d.c. power supply. The heat sink was mounted onto the z-stage to 
allow for repeatable control of the TPV cell positioning with respect 
to the aperture, reflectors and lamp.

The TPV efficiency was measured by taking simultaneous measure-
ments of Pout and Qc. The electric power was measured using a source 
meter (Keithley 2430) by sourcing the voltage and measuring the cur-
rent density at the maximum power point, and Qc was measured using 
the HFS beneath the cell. Owing to the temperature-dependent sensi-
tivity of the HFS, the average HFS temperature, Ts, was needed, which 
is taken from the average of the hot- and cold-side temperatures.  
The hot-side temperature was measured by a thermocouple placed 
underneath the cell. The cold-side temperature was determined itera-
tively using the thermal resistance of the sensor (4.167 K W–1), the meas-
ured heat flux and the cell temperature. From the calibration certificate 
from the manufacturer, the sensitivity S μ

Emitter spectrum
The spectrum of the light source was measured using spectrometers 
in the visible (Ocean Insight FLAME) and in the near-infrared (NIR) 
(Ocean Insight NIRQUEST). The spectrometers were calibrated using 
a 1,000 W, 3,200 K quartz tungsten halogen bulb with known spectrum 
(Newport). Spectrum measurements at several temperatures can be 
found in Extended Data Fig. 4. To extrapolate the measured spectrum 
to a broader wavelength range, the spectrum was modelled by consid-
ering the literature values of the emission of tungsten56, the filament 
material, and transmission of quartz, for the envelope surrounding 
the bulb. Quartz transmission was calculated for a 3-mm-thick piece 
of quartz using optical constants from the literature57. The filament 
consists of tungsten coils with non-zero view factor to themselves.  
The coil geometry acts to smooth the spectral emission because light 
emitted by the inside of the coil has a high view factor to itself.  
Therefore, a geometric factor accounting for this smoothing was used 
as a fitting parameter to model the spectrum to extend it beyond the 
spectrometer measurement range. Extended Data Figure 5a shows a 
comparison between the spectrum described by the emission of  
tungsten with AR = 1 and VF = 1, a blackbody spectrum shape and the 
model, which was found to agree well with the measured spectrum. 
Owing to the good agreement, the modelled spectrum was then used 
to form the efficiency predictions. We refer to this spectrum as 
E

 in the subsequent sections, where λ is wavelength.
Extended Data Figure 5b shows a comparison between the TPV 
model results under the lightbulb spectra with spectra corresponding 
to emitter/cell pairs with VF = 1, which allows the reflected light to be 
recycled (an example of these systems is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1). 
Modelling is shown for a tungsten emitter operating with AR = 1 and 
VF = 1, and for a blackbody emitter with VF = 1. The results show that 
the lightbulb spectra provide a characterization of TPV efficiency that 
is relevant to various higher intensity spectra experienced in TPV  
systems.
Effective view factor
To compare the measured TPV cell performance to model predictions, 
the effective view factor, VF ,
eff  was deduced from Jsc which was com-
puted from Osterwald58 and is shown in equations (2) and (3). We used 
an NREL-fabricated GaAs cell with measured EQE and a Jsc that was 
measured at NREL on an XT-10 solar simulator (AM1.5D, 1,000 W m–2) 
using a secondary calibration reference cell to set the intensity. Before 
an efficiency measurement, the GaAs cell was placed in the setup at 
the same location as the multi-junction cell using the z-stage. In equa-
tion (2), Jsc
TPV is the short-circuit current of the GaAs cell measured in 
the efficiency setup, Jsc

Efficiency validation
Equation (1) for TPV efficiency can also be written in terms of equa-
tion (5), where Pinc is the irradiance incident on the cell, Pref is the flux 
reflected by the cell, Pinc,a is the above-bandgap irradiance, Pinc,sub is 
the sub-bandgap irradiance, Ra is the spectral-weighted above-bandgap 
reflectance and Rsub is the spectral-weighted sub-bandgap reflectance27. 
The denominator of the efficiency expression represents the net flux 
to the cell.

The measured Voc, Jsc and FF are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8 and 
Extended Data Tables 1 and 2. To model the numerator or electric power 
portion of the efficiency expression (Extended Data Fig. 8), we used a 
well-established analytical model that takes values extracted from 
experiments as input parameters59. Using a flash simulator with known 
spectral irradiance, we first measured the cell performance under care-
fully controlled conditions of known spectrum with the cell tempera-
ture fixed at 25 °C. Using the model, we fit the data satisfactorily over 
an irradiance range of several orders of magnitude (shown for the 
1.2/1.0 eV tandem in Extended Data Fig. 9a). The fitting was done using 
only three parameters: the geometric averaged dark current for the 
two junctions in the form of W =

 (ref. 60) where Eg is the bandgap 
and Woc is the bandgap-voltage offset, the n = 2 component of the dark 
current and the effective lumped series resistance Rseries. We refer to 
these as the cell characteristic parameters.
We then measured the IV performance parameters ( J
V
,
, FF
sc
oc
) of 
the device as a function of the ratio of the top to bottom junction pho-
tocurrents under a continuous 1 sun simulator for which the spectral 
content can be varied. Using the measured EQE of the cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 3), the photocurrent ratio for a given emitter temperature 
can be calculated, and using reference cells58 the simulator was set to 
that photocurrent ratio for each emitter temperature. With the meas-
ured EQE and the cell characteristic parameters from above, we calcu-
lated the cell performance parameters and compared them to the 

measurements (shown for the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem in Extended Data 
Fig. 9b). The agreement supports the validity of the modelling process 
and its ability to correctly predict performance trends under a wide 
range of conditions—for both irradiance and emitter temperature (that 
is, spectrum).
The measured spectra (Extended Data Fig. 4) were used along with 
the measured EQE to calculate the top and bottom junction photocur-
rents (equation (6)). With those as inputs to the model, and the cell 
characteristic parameters determined above, we computed the cell 
performance parameters under the actual efficiency measurement 
conditions. The cell temperature varies (Extended Data Fig. 6a). This 
was accounted for using a well-established model that works especially 
well for near-ideal devices, such as III–V devices. The model accounts 
for the temperature dependence through its effect on the intrinsic 
carrier density, and thus the dark current, and the effects of the band-
gap variation with temperature61,62. Extended Data Figure 9c shows a 
comparison of the computed cell performance for a 25 °C cell and at 
the measured cell temperature for the 1.2/1.0 eV tandem.

 was used to determine Pinc

tance, ρ λ

range of the spectrum. The mid-infrared sub-bandgap reflectance was 
measured using a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer 
(Nicolet iS50) with an integrating sphere accessory (PIKE Mid-IR Inte-
gratIR). A copper aperture with area approximately 0.35 cm2 was used 
over the sample port, and the spot encompassed both the cell and the 
front grids. The above-bandgap and NIR sub-bandgap reflectance was 
measured using an ultraviolet-visible-NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 
7000) with the diffuse reflectance accessory and with a spot size 
approximately 0.4 cm2 encompassing the cell and the front grids. Pref 
was then calculated according to equation (8).

This approach to modelling the cells was used to predict the cell 
performance under the tungsten filament lighting conditions.  
The decomposition of reflectance into Ra and Rsubportions (equa-

Rsub shown in Fig. 3b.
Heat transfer considerations
We examined the influence of different parasitic heat flows on the effi-
ciency measurement. A schematic of the different parasitic heat flows 
is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6b and they are quantified in Extended 
Data Fig. 6c. Possible parasitic heat flows, Qparastic, are given by equa-
tion (9). A positive value of Qparastic would act to increase the measured 
heat flow and reduce the measured efficiency, whereas a negative value 
of Qparastic would have the opposite effect.

For example, the aperture does not block all the light hitting the 
electrical leads. Qcond,clips arises owing to conduction from the electric 
leads into the cell that is cooled by the heat sink, which by design are 
thermally stranded from the heat sink using insulation. To quantify 
this value, we performed measurements of the heat flow both with and 
without the electrical leads attached to the cell. In both cases the cell 
was operating at Voc to avoid differences in heating due to power being 
extracted by the cell. The difference between the two heat flows is 
Qcond,clips. The results show that, at most emitter temperatures, the 
heat flow in the presence of the leads is larger than without, because 
the leads are thermally stranded while the cell is actively cooled. Thus, 
inclusion of such a term would lead to a higher efficiency than what is 
reported.
The next parasitic heat flow is due to radiation from the aperture 
plate to the cell, Qrad,gain. The temperature of the bottom of the aperture 
plate was measured with a thermocouple at the different emitter tem-
peratures. Aperture temperatures varied from 43 °C at the lowest emit-
ter temperature to 125 °C at the highest. The view factor between the 
aperture plate and the cell, Fac, was calculated from their geometry and 
spacing. The heat transfer from the aperture to the cell was calculated 
using a diffuse grey approximation according to equation 10, where 
Aap is the area of the aperture plate and Acell is the area of the cell.

The emissivity of the cell weighted by the spectrum at the aperture 
temperature is εcell (0.15 for the 1.4/1.2 eV tandem and 0.11 for the 
1.2/1.0 eV tandem) and the emissivity of the aperture is ε
≈0.1

There is also radiative transfer between the cell and the ambient 
environment, Qrad,loss, but this was found to be negligible at the cell 
temperature and the calculated view factor between the cell and the 
environment. Nonetheless, it was included in the calculation of Qparastic 
for completeness.
Another parasitic heat flow is convective heat loss from the cell to 
the ambient,

where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and T∞ is the ambient 
temperature. The ambient temperature was measured with a thermo-
couple, which was blocked from irradiance by the light source using 
several layers of aluminium foil forming a radiation shield. Ambient 
temperatures were found to vary between 26 °C at the lowest emitter 
temperature and 33 °C at the highest emitter temperature. h was cal-
culated using a Nusselt (Nu) correlation for natural convective heat 
transfer from a horizontal plate at the calculated Rayleigh (Ra) num-
ber63. Heat transfer coefficients were calculated at each cell/ambient 
temperature, with the average being h = 5.8 W m

Qparastic is a small and positive quantity at most emitter temperatures. 
At lower emitter temperatures it is dominated by Qcond,clips, whereas 
at higher emitter temperatures Qconv,loss and Qrad,gain become more 
important. The potential impact of Qparastic on the efficiency measure-
ment is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6d. Overall, Qparastic has a small 
impact on the efficiency because Qparastic is two orders of magnitude 
lower than Qc. Because Qparastic is largely derived from modelling and 
correlation, we do not include it in the efficiency measurement 
reported. In fact, our calculation of Qarasitic largely predicts a higher 
efficiency than the measured value, which indicates reported measured 
efficiency could be conservative.
Uncertainty propagation
Uncertainty in the efficiency measurement arises from the measure-
ment of Pout and the measurement of Qc (equation (1)). From the 
manufacturer, the calibration accuracy of the HFS is ±3%. We include 
an additional 10 °C temperature uncertainty in Ts, the sensor tem-
perature, which comes from the average temperature rise across the 
sensor as calculated from the thermal resistance of the sensor 
(4.167 K W–1) and the average heat flux passing through the sensor.

The uncertainty in the emitter temperature measurement was calcu-
lated from the variation in resistance of the bulb measured at each emit-
ter temperature and the uncertainty in the temperature dependence 
of the resistance from the literature expression that was used, which 
is a 0.1% relative error on resistance as a function of temperature55. 
The root mean square of these two yielded temperature measurement 
uncertainties of less than 4 °C, which had a negligible impact on model 
uncertainty.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Emitter spectrum measurements and model.  
The emitter spectrum was measured at different emitter temperatures spanning 
the test temperature range. A model (Methods) was fit to the measurement and 
used to extend the spectra measurements to longer wavelengths. The spectral 
radiance goes to zero > ~4500 nm due to the presence of the quartz envelope 
around the bulb, as quartz is absorbing beyond this wavelength.

between the spectrum shape at an intermediate test temperature (2130 °C) The 
red curve shows the modeled spectrum which agrees well with the 
measurement (see Extended Data Fig. 4). The gray curve shows comparison to a 
blackbody spectrum shape at the same emitter temperature. The blue curve 
shows comparison to the spectrum described by the literature emission of 
tungsten with AR=1, VF=1. All curves are normalized by their peak to show the 
comparison in spectra shapes. The spectrum shape under which the cells were 
characterized (red curve) is similar to that of a blackbody (gray curve), 
particularly above bandgap. Comparison of modeled TPV efficiency under the 
spectrum in this work with emitters which could be incorporated into a TPV 
system in which the AR and VF allow for the reflected light to be recycled. 
Shown is a tungsten (W) emitter with AR = 1 and VF = 1 as well as a blackbody 
emitter (cavity) with VF = 1. An example of systems which could have this 
geometry is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. The W emitter results in a higher 
efficiency because the selective emissivity properties of W suppress some of 
the below-bandgap energy. Additionally, the W emitter causes the peak in 
efficiency to shift to lower temperature because the emissivity of W weights 
the spectrum towards shorter wavelengths. The blackbody emitter results in a 
lower efficiency because the high irradiance causes a larger penalty of series 
resistance loss due to the high current density. The comparison shows that the 
efficiency measured under the lightbulb spectrum in this work provides an 
appropriate and relevant characterization for TPV efficiency in a real TPV 
sub-system. In all cases, the cell temperature is 25 °C.

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Cell temperature and parasitic heat flows. a) Cell 
temperature vs emitter temperature. The cell temperature increases with 
emitter temperature due to the heat flux sensor which undesirably impedes 
heat flow. b) Schematic (not to scale) showing parasitic heat flows in the 
experiment. c) Calculated parasitic heat flows for the 1.4/1.2-eV device.  
A positive value would act to increase the measured heat flow and reduce the 
measured efficiency, while a negative value would have the opposite effect. d) 
Comparison of the efficiency measurement (solid circles) to the measurement 
with the addition of the modeled parasitic heat flows (open circles) for both 
tandems.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Experimental setup. a) Schematic of the concentrator 
setup showing the relative placement of the ellipsoidal and compound 
parabolic reflectors, water-cooled aperture, TPV cell, HFS, and heat sink.  
b) Image of the concentrator setup. c) Schematic of the heat and electricity 
flows through the measurement device. Electric power is extracted by two 
copper clips which interface with the cell bus bars on the top surface of the cell 
and are thermally and electrically insulated from the heat sink. d) Image of the 
cell on the heatsink with electrical leads. The aperture was removed for clarity.

Extended Data Fig. 8 | Jsc, Voc, and FF. Modeled vs measured a) Jsc, b) Voc, and c) 
FF. Good agreement can be seen between the measurement and model 
predictions. For each device, the FF measurement and model exhibit the same 
trend and the minimum in FF for 1.2/1.0-eV agrees well between the model and 
measurement which suggests good calibration of the emitter temperature.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | Electric power modeling. a) Measurements of Voc and 
FF vs Jsc for the 1.2/1.0-eV device under the high irradiance flash simulator over 
a wide range of irradiances, but fixed spectrum and fixed cell temperature at 
25 °C. A model was fit to the data using the three fitting parameters to 
determine the cell characteristics. The measurement over a wide irradiance 
range is critical to extract the Rseries parameter under the high-irradiance 
conditions of interest. b) Low irradiance measurements of Voc and FF under a 
continuous 1 sun simulator in which the spectral content could be varied to 
produce photocurrent ratios of the two junctions corresponding to different 
emitter temperatures. Cell temperature was fixed at 25 °C. The model was 
determined using the cell characteristic parameters which were extracted 
from fitting to the data over a wide range of irradiances. The good agreement 
suggests that the model can be used to predict Voc, Jsc, FF over a wide range of 
conditions (irradiance and spectra). c) Modeled cell performance parameters 
under the measured spectra showing a comparison between results for a 25 °C 
cell temperature and the measured cell temperature.
