 Nine carbon stars at high galactic latitude, including the first eight carbon stars from the Case survey have a corrected
 line-of -sight velocity dispersion of 101 km s"1. If they are similar to the carbon stars found in dwarf spheroidal galaxies,
 they range in distance from 5 to 50 kpc. Their velocity dispersion is higher than the prediction of the cylindrical model for
 the Galactic velocity ellipsoid by Ratnatunga and Freeman, but equal to that of Galactic globular clusters. One of these
 stars may have an age of less than six billion years.
 Key words: carbon stars - galactic structure - Population II
 I. Introduction
 Among the objects classified by the Case Low-Dis-
 persion Northern Sky Survey (Pesch and Sanduleak
 1983) are several of the faintest carbon stars yet de-
 tected. If these stars are similar to previously known car-
 bon stars, their apparent magnitudes place them at very
 large distances (~ 20 kpc) in the Galactic halo. The ori-
 gin and kinematics of such objects are of great interest,
 especially considering the limited means at our disposal
 to probe the dynamics of the outer halo. Pesch (1984)
 provided us with a prepublication list of carbon-star can-
 didates, and our spectroscopic and photometric in-
 vestigation of these stars is reported here.
 II. Spectroscopy
 Spectrograms of eleven Case Carbon stars (CCS) were
 obtained in 10-15-minute exposures at the 5-m telescope
 on 1984 March 30 and 31 (UT). We used the double
 spectrograph (Oke and Gunn 1982) with the 2D-Frutti
 photon counter (Shectman 1984) as the blue detector
 (1.5 Â resolution) and a Texas Instruments CCD camera
 in the red (6 Á resolution). Iron-argon plus neon com-
 parison spectra bracketed each exposure. The seeing was
 2", but a 1" slit was used to retain resolution. The posi-
 tion angle of the slit was set following Filippenko (1982)
 to compensate for atmospheric dispersion. The spectra
 were flux calibrated using GD 190 (Oke 1974) and
 G138-31 (Filippenko and Greenstein 1984) as stan-
 dards, and are reproduced in Figure 1.
 Strong Swan bands are the definitive feature of carbon
 stars in the blue spectra. By this criterion eight of the
 candidates are clearly carbon stars. A strong G band of
 CH is also present in each of them. A high 12C to 13C ra-
 tio is indicated by the strength of '4737 relative to
 '4744 12C13C and A4752 13C13C. CCS 1231, 1239, 1149,
 1135, 1015 are 13C rich. Balmer lines are seen in emis-
 sion in both CCS 1037 and CCS 1523; the latter, as we
 shall see, is a remarkable star in every way. The red CN
 system is prominent in the red spectra (except
 CCS 1217). The strongest bandhead is (0,2) at 7872 Â.
 The raw blue spectra were also rebinned onto a loga-
 rithmic wavelength scale and cross-correlated against
 the template CCS 1239. Carbon-star velocity standards
 (HD 57884, HD 63353, and HD 79319; McClure 1984a)
 were observed alongside the CCS stars and treated in the
 same way. The resultant rms residual in velocity for
 these three stars was 4 km s"1. Heliocentric velocities for
 the carbon stars are given in Table I. An independent
 check of the radial velocities of CCS 1149 and CCS 1523
 is available from échelle observations at Mount Hopkins

 nary. Of course, it could be that all Population II car
 stars are binaries (cf. McClure 1984b). The distinctio
 this area would be that CCS 1523 has received sufficient
 mass to elevate an original 0.8 4)f © star to the AGB lumi-
 nosity of a 1.2 SDÌ © star, where it is now dredging up car-
 bon in its own right. Careful radial-velocity monitoring
 can test this theory. Note that CCS 1523 has hydrogen
 emission lines which could arise in a mass flow.
 The rightward displacement in the (H - K) color index
 of CCS 1523 seen in Figure 2 is noteworthy. This may
 reflect a blanketing difference that could arise if
 CCS 1523 is very metal poor (cf. Fig. 1, Aaronson and
 Mould 1985). But we cannot be confident of these very
 red colors at the 1% level because we did not observe
 any very red standards to calibrate them.
 Two other candidates for intermediate-age halo car-
 bon stars have appeared in the literature (Sanduleak
 1980; Margon et al. 1984). The IR photometry for
 1509-090 reported by Margon et al. indicated a blue
 color for this object but was not of high accuracy. As
 noted in the last row of Table II, we have reobserved
 this star with the CTIO 4-m, and the results there and in
 Figure 2 clearly imply that this object is of low luminosity.
 No IR photometry exists for the Sanduleak star, which
 Sanduleak (1980) suggests is possibly associated with the
 Magellanic Stream. However, the blue color estimated
 by Sanduleak ((B - V) ~ 1), combined with the blue con-
 tinuum and weak C2 bands found from a spectrum by
 Richer and Westerland (1983), strongly suggest that the
 star is similar to the old, low-luminosity C stars in Draco,
 Ursa Minor, and co Cen. Hence, it seems that CCS 1523
 is the only bona fide intermediate-age carbon star known
 in the Galactic halo.
 To estimate the distances of these carbon stars we em-
 ploy Figure 3 and the photometric parallax method. Fig-
 ure 3 is a color-magnitude diagram for all known carbon
 stars in the Draco, Ursa Minor, and Leo I, II dwarf sphe-
 roidal galaxies (Aaronson and Mould 1985). The mean gi-
 ant branch drawn through these data runs parallel to
 that of 47 Tucanae (Frogel, Persson, and Cohen 1981)
 and M92 (Cohen, Frogel, and Persson 1978). Since the
 kinematics of the present sample is evidently that of
 Population II, it seems reasonable that these stars should
 fit a giant branch similar to that of the dwarf spheroidal
 carbon stars. The adopted distance moduli for stars with
 infrared photometry in Table I should therefore be re-
 liable to 0™5. Interstellar reddening is assumed to be
 negligible at these high latitudes. For CCS 1217 and
 CCS 1231 we have adopted distances of 5 kpc on the as-
 sumption that they are closer than the rest of the sample
 by Üie difference in their mean red magnitudes (Pesch
 1984) from that of the other six stars.
 IV. Kinematics
 The line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the sample is
 111 ± 26 km s"1, fortuitously close to that of Galactic
 globular clusters (Frenk and White 1980), and in-
 distinguishable from that of inner or outer clusters with-
 in the errors. The application of a Galactic rotation term
 (220 km s"1 toward I = 90°, b = 0°) yields a mean ve-
 locity of -30 ± 34 km s"1 and slightly reduces the line-
 of-sight dispersion to 101 ± 24 km s"1. The data can
 help to distinguish, however, between alternate hypoth-
 eses for the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid in the
 Galactic halo. The present sample is strongly concen-
 trated toward the north galactic pole and has a velocity

 dispersion more than 1.5a larger than the 60 ± 8 km s"1
 found at similar Z distances at the south pole by Ratna-
 tunga and Freeman (1984) from K giants.
 Ratnatunga and Freeman propose a cylindrical model
 in which the velocity ellipsoid of Hartwick (1983) is con-
 stant in size and maintains a minor axis pointed at the
 galactic poles. This model can reproduce the present
 data (a > 100 km s"1) in only 5% of Monte Carlo trials.
 The alternate spherical model in which the velocity el-
 lipsoid is everywhere elongated toward the Galactic
 Center satisfies this criterion 73% of the time.
 Clearly, the present data are not sufficient to choose
 definitely between the models. But the Case survey will
 provide a statistically significant sample of stars for this
 purpose. Crucial to resolving any real differences with
 Ratnatunga and Freeman will be the level of con-
 tamination of the distant giant stars in our respective
 samples by dwarfs. Note that only one carbon dwarf is
 currently known: G77-61 (Dahn et al. 1977; Dearborn
 et al. 1985). We can calculate the number of giant car-
 bon stars expected in the current survey. Assuming a car-
 bon-star frequency1 in the globular clusters of Nc L =
 10~4 (Aaronson and Mould 1985), and a luminosity of
 the spheroid of Mv - -20 (Edmunds and Phillipps
 1984), one obtains a total of 104 halo carbon stars in the

 galaxy. With an effective radius of 2 kpc and an r1/4 law,
 this is equivalent to six carbon stars in a heliocentric
 cone of height 50 kpc and solid angle of 300 deg2. The
 current CCS sample, assumed complete from 10 to 13
 hours RA, can all be accounted for as giants.

 nicating the CCS list before publication. We also thank
