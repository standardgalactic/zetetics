The Cleantech 
Revolution
It’s exponential, disruptive, and 
now

Executive Summary
•
So exponential growth of cleantech will continue. By 2030, 
we will be installing 1,000 GW of solar a year and selling 6,000 
GWh of batteries a year, making possible the COP goal of tripling 
renewable capacity. Electrification rates will double to 0.5% a 
year, and efficiency gains will increase to over 3% a year.
•
The fossil fuel system faces inexorable decline. Renewables 
will drive fossil fuels out of electricity generation, electrification 
will push fossils out of final energy, and efficiency will reduce 
fossil waste. Some 75% of fossil fuel demand is exposed to 
rapidly growing cleantech alternatives, so stranded assets are 
inevitable.
•
Wider implications of change. The goals of the Paris 
Agreement are feasible, and the Global South will continue to 
leapfrog to cleantech.
•
This is the pivot decade. When cleantech costs become 
irresistible, the renewable capacity is built, fossil fuel demand 
reaches the end of its plateau, and the transition is priced into 
markets.
•
Now is the time to act.  We need to build out renewables and 
electrify energy use, make good bets on small modular 
technologies, and harvest the enormous efficiency opportunity. 
The direction of change is inevitable, but the speed is up to us.
•
The energy system is being transformed by the exponential forces of 
renewables, electrification, and efficiency.
•
The orthodox view of slow change is wrong. New clean technologies 
beat old fossil commodities because clean technologies' costs fall over 
time on learning curves, they are universal, and they grow quickly.
•
Exponential change has been remarkable in the past decade. 
Cleantech costs have fallen by up to 80 percent, while investment is up 
nearly tenfold and solar generation has risen twelvefold. Electricity has 
become the largest source of useful energy, and the deep force of 
efficiency has reduced energy demand by a fifth.
•
Change is led by China. Half the growth in cleantech is from China, but 
exponential growth is also happening in the OECD and across the Global 
South as Asia electrifies.
•
Red flags across the fossil fuel system. New fossil electricity capacity 
peaked in 2010, oil and gas capex in 2014, and internal combustion 
engine (ICE) car sales in 2017. Fossil demand peaked for industry in 2014, 
for buildings in 2018, most likely for electricity in 2023, and will shortly 
peak in transport.
•
The drivers of growth are more powerful than the barriers. Falling 
cleantech costs, the energy security of eternal renewables, Chinese 
leadership, and a race to the top will continue to overwhelm a fragile 
fossil fuel system which wastes two-thirds of its primary energy and fails 
to pay for its externality costs.

Introduction
•
There are two main perspectives on the energy transition: the old incumbent view 
of business-as-usual; and the new insurgent view of exponential change.
•
At heart this is the longstanding battle of commodities versus technologies. Design 
and technologies beat commodities because they enjoy learning curves and are 
limitless. So costs fall over time, and growth is exponential.
•
New energy comes from manufactured, modular, scalable, clean technologies; old 
energy is from centralized, heavy, dirty commodities.
•
Old energy forecasting has failed in the face of the new energy reality. Linear 
forecasts constrained by barriers to growth have consistently been overwhelmed 
by exponential change.
•
There are three key levers in the energy transition: Renewables; Electrification; and 
Efficiency.

Exponential growth so far
•
There is clear evidence three drivers of changes are growing exponentially: 
renewables, electrification, and efficiency.
•
Cleantech costs fall by around 20% for every doubling in deployment and have 
fallen by up to 80% in a decade.
•
Capital is pouring into cleantech. Getting to the first trillion of annual investment 
took decades; the second trillion will take only 4 years.
•
Solar generation is doubling every 2-3 years and battery storage every year.  Solar 
is poised to deploy the largest amount of generation capacity, and batteries are 
about to overtake pumped hydro. 
•
The supply chain is already in place for enough solar and batteries for net zero.
•
Electricity supply has been growing inexorably for a century and is now the largest 
supplier of useful energy.
•
Efficiency is the deep force of the energy transition, saving one fifth of total demand 
over the last decade.
•
China leads the exponential story and is poised to be the first major electrostate.  
Exponential change is happening in the OECD and across the Global South as Asia 
leapfrogs the OECD in electrification.

The era of peaking fossil fuel demand
•
Pessimists keep raising barriers to change; optimists keep solving them.
•
Early warning signals for fossils include peak new fossil fuel electricity capacity 
(2010), peak capex for oil and gas (2014), peak ICE demand (2017), and peak per 
capita fossil demand (2012–18).
•
Global fossil fuel demand for industry peaked in 2014, and in buildings in 2018.
•
Fossil fuel demand likely peaked in electricity in 2023 and will peak in transport 
before the end of the decade.
•
OECD fossil fuel demand peaked in 2007, and every major area of demand has 
peaked in the United States.
•
China is the pivot nation in the transition away from fossil fuels, and most areas of 
demand have clearly peaked there.
•
Peaks are showing up across the Global South, from South America to South Africa 
and Thailand.

Why rapid change will continue
•
The three drivers of change — renewables, electrification and efficiency — are self-
reinforcing.
•
Cleantech costs will keep falling at around 20% for every doubling of deployment as 
technology gets better and spreads around the world.
•
Fossil fuels are vulnerable because they have huge unpaid externalities (up to $7 
trillion a year), get large subsidies ($1 trillion a year), and waste two-thirds of their 
energy.
•
Cleantech provides energy security: 86% of people live in fossil-importing countries 
today; renewable resources are 100 times larger than fossil fuels, and available 
everywhere.
•
The world’s largest energy consumer, China, lacks oil and gas, and cleantech is a 
path to leadership, clean air, and zero emissions. So, China will continue to deploy 
cleantech rapidly.
•
There is a race to the top as others try to catch up. Cleantech is now 10% of global 
GDP growth, and there is a race to lead the cleantech industries of the future.  
Meanwhile, as the world burns, so policy pressure will rise.
•
Clean technologies will continue to follow S-curves, cascading across sectors and 
geographies. Change at the frontier is hard, but most countries can copy the leaders.

Implications for the energy system
•
If change continues on S-curves, then by 2030 we expect solar sales of over 1,000 
GW a year and battery sales of over 6,000 GWh a year.
•
S-curves imply that by 2030 solar and wind generation will triple to over 12,000 
TWh and EVs will be two-thirds of car sales.
•
The annual electrification rate is likely to more than double to 0.5% in 2030 as 
transport joins the party, and success in China drags up electrification rates 
elsewhere.
•
Annual efficiency gains are likely to double from the 1.5% average of the past two 
decades to at least 3% as the result of the rising share of renewables, 
electrification, and a greater focus on end-use efficiency.
•
Renewables will push out fossil electricity, electrons will push out molecules, and 
efficiency will reduce waste. In a typical X shaped pattern.
•
Over 75% of fossil fuel demand today is threatened by rapidly growing cleantech 
alternatives. 
•
Fossil fuel demand will be squeezed between efficiency and cleantech. The demand 
plateau will last until the end of the decade, and then clear decline will set in.

•
Paris is achievable because we are at the pivot point in the 300-year history of 
fossil fuel use.
•
The race for the top is on fire.  A battle for leadership is taking place in every area 
of energy supply and demand.  Competition will drive change.
•
The Global South can continue to leapfrog to cleantech.  Witness the success of 
Kenya, Barbados, Morocco, Vietnam or Bangladesh.
•
We are at peak waste, so we can reduce the pressure on nature.
•
The great capital reallocation will continue.  Capital will shift into areas of growth 
and out of those in decline.
•
Stranded fossil fuel assets will result from the gap between the expectations 
of incumbents for business-as-usual and the reality of exponential change.
•
Since the fossil fuel system is huge ($50 trillion of fixed assets), this asset stranding 
has profound implications for the financial system.
•
As China is leading this transition, we need to benchmark to China.
•
The debate will be very different by 2030 and the transition will be priced into 
markets.

This is the pivot decade when cleantech manufacturing capacity is built, 
renewables get too cheap to resist, and fossil fuel demand reaches the end of its 
plateau.
•
Focus on the signal not the noise.  We need to prepare for change, not hide behind 
denial.
•
We need to continue building out the renewable system, speed up electrification in 
the OECD, and increase focus on efficiency.
•
We should make good bets on solutions that work: small modular technologies 
and efficiency measures.  Equally, we need to avoid high-cost, inefficient, and 
unproven bets.
•
Companies need to move from tactics to strategy.
•
Investors should retool for the megatheme of the energy transition.
•
Energy modelers need to change their approach or become stranded experts.
•
And we need to get on with it. We are in a race between climate and economic 
tipping points.  The direction is inevitable, but speed is up to us.
