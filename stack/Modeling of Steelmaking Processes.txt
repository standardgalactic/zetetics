Preface
Modeling is a vast subject and has diverse applications. It is used extensively in all 
disciplines of engineering for forecasting, process analysis, design and optimization, 
as well as for developing new technology. From the prediction of complex weather 
patterns at one end to the design of swimsuits at the other, modeling has, over the 
years, quietly but steadily entered into every sphere of human life. In engineering, 
modeling is used routinely to gain useful insights into a process rapidly, and in a 
cost-effective manner.
The visual opacity, high operating temperature, and relatively large size of indus-
trial reactors often preclude direct experimental observation, and therefore the 
analysis, design, optimization, and control of steelmaking rely overwhelmingly on 
modeling. It is essential that shop fl oor and R&D engineers associated with steel-
making have the requisite knowledge of process modeling. However, this has been 
seriously impeded by the absence of textbooks dealing specifi cally with the sub-
ject of modeling pertaining to steelmaking. Modeling of Steelmaking Processes has 
therefore been designed to fi ll this gap and fulfi ll a long-standing demand of metal-
lurgical engineering students as well as practicing engineers.
This book has been developed with a self-learning perspective, caters to beginners, 
and helps readers navigate comfortably through an otherwise complex subject. Chapter 1 
presents an overview of steelmaking, modeling, and measurements, wherein the evolu-
tion of steelmaking is briefl y traced, and a summary of the modern-day steelmaking 
technology is provided. The relevance of modeling and measurements is subsequently 
discussed briefl y. Emerging issues such as environmental emissions, recycling, prod-
uct development, and quality are also introduced in this chapter and discussed in the 
context of future steelmaking technology.
A sound knowledge base of thermodynamics, metallurgical kinetics, transport 
phenomena, and numerical methods is essential to studying the modeling of steel-
making. Chapter 2 presents a brief overview of the scientifi c fundamentals and 
covers principles of thermodynamics, fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer, as well as 
reaction kinetics, to emphasize their preeminence in the modeling of steelmaking 
processes. Several excellent textbooks can be consulted as resource material on each 
of these subjects, and should provide further understanding wherever necessary. 
A remarkably vast knowledge bank is also accessible through the Web. We have 
acknowledged this and have deliberately avoided unnecessary compilations on such 
topics as thermodynamics, and physical and thermophysical properties. Reliance on 
the literature and the Web has helped contain the volume of the book.
Chapters 3 and 4 introduce the principles of physical and mathematical modeling, 
respectively. Chapter 3 addresses systematically the laws of physical modeling, 
water modeling of steelmaking processes, and their potential and limitations. The 
discussion is supplemented with several practical examples elucidating the under-
lying scientifi c principles. Chapter 4 discusses mathematical modeling approaches 
and highlights the role of phenomenological models in the context of steelmaking

Preface
process analysis. It introduces essential steps in model building and explains the 
essence of numerical solutions of model equations. It also discusses the role of com-
mercial software in steelmaking process modeling and describes, in this context, 
two popular softwares, namely, Fluent and COMSOL.
Chapters 5 through 7 describe the modeling of steelmaking processes from a 
phenomenological standpoint. Chapter 5 describes, through specifi c examples, the 
modeling of laminar fl ow, and turbulent single- and multiphase fl ows, and explains 
formulation methodologies. It includes comparisons between predictions and mea-
surements, wherever possible, to demonstrate the adequacy of the various approaches. 
Chapter 6 describes the modeling of various molten steel processing operations. A 
variety of phenomenological models pertaining to subsurface motion, melting and dis-
solution of alloying additions, thermal energy transport, mixing, grade transition, resi-
dence time distributions, and solidifi cation are all discussed in this chapter. Population 
balance models of inclusion and bubble distributions are also explained. In this con-
text, maximum emphasis is given to understanding the problem, conceptual model-
ing, and mathematical formulation, including governing equations and the boundary 
conditions. Equivalent experimental results from the literature are also drawn upon 
to demonstrate various model study programs. Chapter 7 describes the modeling of 
solid-state processing operations, and formulates mathematical models for slab reheat-
ing, case carburizing, mechanical working, and microstructural evolution to enunciate 
the diverse modeling principles. It also briefl y presents emerging topics like phase fi eld 
modeling as the next generation of modeling tools.
Chapter 8 highlights the role of empirical modeling in steelmaking. It describes 
a variety of macroscopic models relevant to ladle metallurgy steelmaking opera-
tions including ladle fl ows, gas–liquid dispersion, mixing, slag eye area, slag droplet 
entrainment, solid–liquid heat, and mass transfer. It also discusses the adequacy of 
such models to high temperature melts in the absence of elaborate solutions to the 
governing differential equations.
Chapter 9 introduces intelligent modeling techniques and presents the essence 
of artifi cial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), and optimization. 
It describes the basic philosophy of ANNs and GAs and their application to steel-
making process analysis and control, where phenomenological models are yet to 
make inroads. It concludes with a brief discussion of neural networks assisted by 
phenomenological models in future modeling endeavors.
The fi nal chapter of the book, Chapter 10, includes a reasonably comprehensive 
practice session on physical and mathematical modeling. The various “do-it-yourself” 
type of exercises provide the reader with an opportunity to get additional under-
standing of the subject directly that was not possible in earlier chapters. At the end of 
every chapter, a set of short questions and numerical problems have been formulated 
to reinforce understanding. Numerical problems are designed to carry additional 
messages, often not elucidated within the main body of the text. The content is ideal 
to serve as a textbook for a full one-semester course on modeling of steelmaking 
processes at the senior undergraduate or postgraduate level.
In writing this book, we have made liberal use of lecture notes from a short-term 
course titled “Modeling in metals processing: Concepts, theory and applications” 
developed at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. In particular, sections 
  

Preface

on thermodynamics, deformation, and microstructural modeling have been exten-
sively referred to. We also gratefully acknowledge the indirect contributions of 
Professor Ahindra Ghosh and Professor Sandeep Sangal of IIT Kanpur to this book. 
Several colleagues and friends have read through different chapters and made valu-
able suggestions. In particular, we would like to acknowledge Professor Animesh 
Biswas of IIT, Kanpur; Professor G.G. Roy of IIT, Kharagpur; and Supriya Sarkar 
of Sandvik Asia. We also gratefully acknowledge the useful technical inputs from 
Suman Guha, a graduate student in the Department of Materials and Metallurgical 
Engineering (MME), IIT, Kanpur. We sincerely acknowledge assistance received 
from Navneet Kumar, A. Muthuchammy, and S.K. Rajasekhar of the Department 
of MME, IIT, Kanpur, for converting all fi gures to the publisher-required format in 
record time. Finally, we gratefully acknowledge partial fi nancial support received 
from the Centre for Development of Technical Education (CDTE), IIT, Kanpur. Yet, 
we cannot hope that the book is entirely free of errors and obscurities. However, it 
certainly is a good deal clearer and more accurate than it would have been without 
all such generous assistances we have been fortunate enough to receive. We conclude 
with the hope that the readers, particularly students, will fi nd this book useful and 
that it fulfi ls its objectives, which have been our prime concern.
The outline of this book partly resembles a course that one of the authors (Dipak 
Mazumdar) has been teaching to the senior undergraduates at IIT, Kanpur, for over a 
decade and a half. The fi nal contents were, however, drawn jointly and evolved during 
Dipak Mazumdar’s sabbatical leave at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2006. 
He is grateful to the IIT Kanpur administration for granting him the leave and giving 
him an opportunity to accomplish this mission. He is also grateful to the Department of 
Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, for supporting 
his yearlong stay through the PE Hearst endowment. In this new place, far away from 
home, the presence of his wife, Sumita, and daughter, Shruti, certainly made the task of 
writing less burdensome. Their indirect contribution to this project must not go unmen-
tioned. Academically and emotionally, 2006–2007 was certainly the most memorable 
year of all the time he has periodically spent in North America since 1982. The intel-
lectually vibrant atmosphere of the university, the unusually pleasant and refreshing 
weather of Berkeley, and the wonderful evenings amid family and light classical Indian 
music made the writing of this book a truly intellectually fulfi lling experience.

1 Steelmaking, Modeling, 
and Measurements
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Steelmaking, since the days of Sir Henry Bessemer, has been revolutionized by many 
innovations (i.e., energy effi cient giant blast furnaces, enormous turnover rates of 
oxygen steelmaking furnaces, continuous casting, etc.). These together with state-
of-the-art process control have contributed not only to the increased production* but 
also to the improved quality of steel enormously. Breakthroughs have been possible 
owing to advances in our knowledge and better understanding of the chemical, physi-
cal, and thermal interactions among steel, slag, gas, and refractory phases during refi n-
ing as well as transfer operations. These, as shown in Figure 1.1, follow from a solid 
understanding of the fundamentals of the manufacturing process and increasing reli-
ance on models and measurements that constitute the “knowledge-based foundation” 
of steelmaking [1,2].
The steelmaking process route encompasses numerous physicochemical pro-
cesses such as melting, separation, chemical reaction, solidifi cation, etc. and 
involves multiphase, reacting, and turbulent fl ow phenomena. A sound understand-
ing of these necessitates adequate knowledge of steelmaking technology, metallur-
gical thermodynamics, and kinetics.† Models and measurements are two additional 
interdependent requirements that help reinforce our understanding of steelmaking 
process dynamics and aid in successful implementation of the knowledge gained. 
Present-day engineers dealing with the making, shaping, and treating of steel must 
have adequate understanding and appreciation of modeling and measurement. A 
synergistic approach combining steelmaking, modeling, and measurements plays 
a pivotal role in solving many recurring problems and is important for shaping the 
future steelmaking industry.
For the sake of better understanding and appreciation of the later chapters as 
well as for completeness of the book, we have included some discussions of steel-
making practice and the science base of steelmaking in the two initial chapters. In 
the section that follows immediately, we fi rst present a brief overview of modern 
steelmaking technology. This is followed by a brief introduction of modeling and 
measurements relevant to steelmaking, discussed more comprehensively again later 
in Chapters 3 and 4.
* World crude steel output during 2008 stands at 1329.7 million metric ton.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
1.2 STEELMAKING: PAST AND PRESENT
The association of mankind with iron and steel is thousands of years old. Extremely 
large volume of steel is daily consumed for building roads, bridges, skyscrapers, 
automobiles, and so on. A modern day life without steel is certainly beyond imagi-
nation. What is steel? Chemically, steel is an alloy of iron and other elements (such 
as C, Si, Mn, Cr, Ni, etc.). From an engineer’s perspective, steel is a material with 
a range of mechanical properties (i.e., ductility, strength, toughness, etc.) that is 
second to none. Versatile mechanical properties coupled with immense recycling 
potential helped steel consolidate its position as a primary engineering material in 
the society. Physical and mechanical properties of steel vis-à-vis other engineer-
ing materials are given in Table 1.1 [3]. It is through maneuvering composition 
and microstructures (induced through specifi c heat and surface treatment tech-
niques as well as mechanical working) that considerable infl uence is exerted on 
the engineering properties of steel. Distinct advantages of steel include strength, 
energy effi ciency, design fl exibility, fi re resistance, less degradation over time, eco-
friendliness, and so on. It is not at all surprising that steel continues to have an edge 
over other materials and fi nds widespread application virtually in every walk of a 
modern day life.
Steel is manufactured from either molten iron (produced from iron ore in an iron 
blast furnace) or direct reduced iron (DRI) (produced via a variety of solid-state 
iron production techniques). It is also produced by recycling steel scraps, mixing 
the same with some DRI, melting and refi ning the latter in electrical steelmaking 
furnaces such as an arc or an induction furnace. Steelmaking essentially involves 
refi ning of molten iron at an elevated temperature (1873 K or so) in refractory lined

vessels. Chemical and thermal interactions among various phases and constituents 
result in the production of molten steel, which is fi nally converted into solid form 
through casting processes.
In his fi rst attempt to refi ne hot metal with air, Henry Bessemer melted pig iron in 
an externally heated fi re clay crucible, deeply submerged a fi re clay blowpipe from 
above and blew air into the metal bath. Since the days of Bessemer, during the past 
150 years or so, phenomenal changes have taken place in practically all realms of 
steelmaking. Global demand of steel has increased steadily during the second half of 
the preceding century mainly due to population explosion, reconstruction after World 
War II, widespread wealth in developed countries, and so on. These have contributed 
to a signifi cant increase in steel production worldwide, which jumped nearly fi ve-
folds (from 200 to nearly 1000 million ton) during the last 50 years. Steady growth 
in steel production continued even in recent times as is evident from Figure 1.2 [4]. 
In 1950, 80% of world’s steel was produced in open-hearth furnaces, which now 
plays only a minor role that is expected to be lost soon for economic and environ-
mental reasons. The Thomas process of steelmaking was phased out by 1970 and the 
Bessemer process even before that. Today, oxygen steelmaking process (primarily 
LD) accounts for approximately 60% and an electric arc furnace (EAF) process 34% 
of steel produced globally. The dominating trend of oxygen and arc furnace steel-
making technology is apparent as shown in Figure 1.3.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Initially steel was made through Bessemer and open-hearth steelmaking processes. 
These processes dominated the steelmaking scenario until oxygen steelmaking 
(basic oxygen steelmaking [BOS]) was introduced during early 1960s. Subsequently, 
to match the high turnover rates of BOS, continuous casting was integrated into the

steelmaking circuitry. These new technologies coupled with effi cient process control 
and automation revolutionized the way steel was produced in early years. In the 
intervening years, many new developments took place and all these have immensely 
contributed to the remarkable growth in steel productivity and quality. Most notable 
among them are larger converters (400–500 ton capacity), shorter refi ning periods in 
a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) (20 kg C/s) as well as in a EAF, prolonged converter 
lining life (20,000 heats or more in a BOF), versatile secondary refi ning techniques, 
and higher casting speed.
Pilot-scale studies and modeling played key roles in many new developments in 
steelmaking. Thus, prior to 1970, process design in steelmaking was largely empiri-
cal and involved execution of a concept in pilot-scale. For example, converters of 
5–15 ton size were used to study the industrial feasibility and economic profi tability 
of the LD steelmaking process. During the post-1970 era, particularly during the 
1980s and 1990s, modeling was increasingly applied in process design, develop-
ment, and control. Large-scale developments in computational hardware and soft-
ware, improved understanding of the underlying process dynamics, emergence of 
water modeling as an effective modeling tool, etc. were in general responsible for 
such a shift. The scale-up and commercialization of Bessemer, steelmaking pro-
cesses like LD steelmaking, etc. while were by and large empirical and based on 
pilot-scale trials, physical, mathematical, and pilot-scale trials have played key roles 
in the development of recently introduced near net-shaped casting processes such as 
strip casting. Increasing reliance on physical and mathematical modeling saves time 
and money. It is now customary to apply water modeling, mathematical modeling, 
and pilot-scale trials in any serious process investigation and design effort.
1.3 AN OVERVIEW OF STEELMAKING
Steelmaking, from converter to caster, is categorized into three distinct stages, popu-
larly known as primary steelmaking, secondary steelmaking, and casting. Primary 
steelmaking is concerned with the production of crude steel, which is subsequently 
refi ned in terms of both its composition and its cleanliness through a host of second-
ary steelmaking processes. The initial, intermediate, and fi nal steel compositions are 
given in Table 1.2 to illustrate the extent of refi ning during the fi rst two stages of 
steelmaking. Molten steel with desired composition, cleanliness, and temperature is 
fi nally transformed into solid products through continuous casting.
Present-day steelmaking process routes involve two dominating technologies 
namely, oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and electric steelmaking (EAF steelmaking). 
Typical steelmaking process routes are illustrated schematically in Figure 1.4. As 
shown there, secondary steelmaking and casting processes are common to both BOS 
and EAF steelmaking. Furthermore, all the secondary steelmaking processes may or 
may not always be integrated into the production circuitry. These processes gener-
ally depend on the grade of steel being produced and are customer driven. A brief 
summary of primary and secondary steelmaking together with casting processes 
are presented in the following sections. More elaborate description is available in 
standard texts [5–7].

1.3.1 PRIMARY STEELMAKING
In the BOS process, molten iron from a blast furnace is refi ned under an oxidizing and 
basic environment. The former is ensured by blowing oxygen through molten steel 
while the latter by maintaining a highly basic slag, i.e.,

. Refi ning 
is carried out in a pear-shaped vessel, traditionally termed as a “converter” (i.e., a 
BOF) and a typical version of the same is shown in Figure 1.5. The vessel is lined with 
basic refractories made from magnesite, dolomite, etc. that provide a relatively inert 
ambient to the otherwise corrosive, basic slag, prepared by dissolving lime. Oxygen is 
injected at supersonic speed into molten iron through a water-cooled, multihole lance. 
This readily dissolves in liquid steel and starts oxidizing and eliminating impurities 
dissolved in blast furnace iron.
The dissolved impurities in molten iron, excepting sulfur, have extremely high 
affi nity for oxygen. Thus, dissolved oxygen and carbon readily react together pro-
ducing gaseous carbon monoxide, which is eliminated easily from the system. 
In addition to that, Si, Mn, and P also readily oxidize and form their respective 
oxides which being acidic in nature forms a chemically stable slag by reacting 
with dissolved lime. Generally, a part of the sulfur is also removed during oxygen 
steelmaking. Dissolved lime helps eliminate the two most harmful impurities in 
iron namely, sulfur and phosphorous. The following are key chemical reactions

The reactions are essentially heterogeneous and to demarcate participating phases 
(), [], and {} are conventionally used to represent slag, metal, and gaseous phases, 
respectively. During a typical heat,* hot metal (i.e., blast furnace iron), scrap, lime, 
iron ore, etc. are charged into a BOF, and oxygen is injected into the vessel through a 
top lance (as in LD) or a set of submerged tuyeres (as in bottom blowing converters). 
With oxygen injection, impurity oxidation, lime dissolution, and slag formation start 
practically simultaneously. A large amount of heat is released due to the oxidation 
reactions (Equations 1.2 through 1.5) making BOS essentially autogeneous. Indeed, 
the surplus heat produced allows for incorporation of a reasonably good amount of 
scrap in the process. Furthermore, chemical heat in CO gas produced via reaction 
(Equation 1.2) is harnessed through postcombustion (Section 6.8.1) in which CO 
is oxidized to CO2. This paves the way for introduction of even more scrap than 
is normally possible. During the blow, oxygen fl ow rate and the lance height are 
adjusted to control the rate of oxidation of the impurity elements. Simultaneously, 
samples are also collected through a “sublance” (a melt sample collector device) to 
exactly know the instantaneous state of melt composition and temperature. Such 
monitoring helps operator decide the “end blow strategy” in advance and results in 
a fi nal melt with correct temperature and compositions. Dynamic monitoring helps 
eliminate any reblow that is known to offset productivity of a steel melt shop. Once 
the blow is terminated, the converter is emptied into a ladle (a cylindrical-shaped, 
refractory-lined vessel) for further refi ning of steel. Due care is always taken to 
minimize slag carryover from BOF to ladle, as converter slag is rich in FeO, i.e., 
having high oxygen potential that adversely affects the effi ciency of subsequent pro-
cessing operations. Subsequently, converter lining is inspected and repaired, slag 
splashing (for protection of lining and submerged tuyeres) is carried out and the 
converter is made ready for the next heat. A wide size range of BOFs are used in 
the industry (typically, between 60 and 400 ton) and the overall duration of refi n-
ing tends to vary with converter size, initial melt composition, etc. The sequence of 
“charging–blowing–sampling and tapping” operations is illustrated through a set of 
schematics in Figure 1.6 [8].
Arc furnace steelmaking gained momentum after the World War II. This is a 
solid charge-based process and uses steel scrap and direct reduced iron (as opposed 
to molten iron in a basic oxygen process) as the chief iron-bearing material. The 
extent of refi ning required in an EAF is generally less than that in a BOF, since 
less amount of impurity is required to be eliminated in the former. The impurities 
present in DRI and other charge materials (e.g., lime) are eliminated through oxida-
tion and fi xing the impurity oxides with a suitable fl uxing agent such as CaO. To

facilitate these, iron ore (as oxidizing agent) and lime (as fl ux) are both added to EAF 
charge material. The reactions between various dissolved impurities and iron ore, in 
contrast to those with dissolved oxygen, do not produce enough heat to make EAF 
steelmaking autogeneous. Energy required for melting solid charge, dissolution, and 
subsequent refi ning of the bath is provided by electrical energy. Graphite electrodes, 
ultrahigh power transformers, etc. are used to strike an arc that supplies heat to the 
solid charge and subsequently to the bath. The total energy required to make 1 ton of 
liquid steel in EAF is approximately 6.7 GJ (electrical energy, burners, and chemical 
energy combined).
The level of agitation in an EAF is not much and therefore the refi ning rate is 
low. To expedite the rate of chemical reactions, oxygen is often injected through 
one or more lances. In many modern EAFs, supersonic jets of oxygen are delivered 
using the Co-jet technology.* Parallel to the above, argon injection from the bottom

through one or more porous plugs is applied. All these are aimed to reduce tap-to-tap 
time and make EAFs more competitive with BOS steelmaking. Basic steelmaking is 
more frequent in EAFs since this allows effective removal of sulfur and phosphorous. 
Periodic chemical analysis of melt helps determine the state of refi ning and prepare 
the operator for taping the furnace. Modern day EAFs are equipped with eccentric 
bottom tapping technology to facilitate easy tapping. EAFs ranging between 10 and 
400 ton are used in steel industry with turnover rates being in the range of 100 ton/h 
or so. A schematic of an EAF is shown in Figure 1.7.
1.3.2 DEOXIDATION AND SECONDARY STEELMAKING
During primarily steelmaking, most of the impurities present in the charge 
(i.e., molten iron, scrap, DRI, etc.) are oxidized and removed. Signifi cant amount 
of oxygen also remains in steel in the dissolved state. The solubility of oxygen in 
liquid steel is appreciable and in oxygen steelmaking, the solubility often exceeds 
0.1 wt%. Dissolved oxygen, if left as it is, seriously impairs mechanical properties 
of steel and must therefore be removed from the melt before casting. The economics of 
steelmaking necessitates that removal of oxygen as well as subsequent adjustment of 
composition and temperature is carried out in a vessel beyond the primary steelmak-
ing furnace such that the latter can be used solely for the production of crude steel 
maximizing productivity.
Deoxidation or “removal of oxygen” is generally facilitated by the addition of 
elements like Al, Si, Mn, etc. either individually or in combination, which have 
larger affi nity toward oxygen than iron. Typically, lump additions of deoxidizer 
elements are made to the bath almost simultaneously with tapping as is illustrated 
in Figure 1.8 [9]. Alternative modes of additions are also used at times for better 
utilization of such additives. For example, aluminum is introduced by injecting 
aluminum wire into the bath at high speed, which ensures subsurface melting and 
dissolution, increasing effi ciency of deoxidizer utilization, and thereby improving

overall process effi ciency. The requirements of a deoxidizer are high reactiv-
ity with dissolved oxygen, minimal residual contamination, and production of a 
deoxidation product that is easily separable from molten steel. The deoxidation 
products (constituted largely by SiO2, Al2O3, FeO, MnS, MgO, etc.) are nonme-
tallic and a potential source of contamination in steel. These are referred to as 
endogenous inclusions. Their presence makes steel as it is loosely termed, “dirty” 
and therefore, it is desirable that contamination from such foreign oxides is mini-
mal. Worn-out refractory pieces remaining entrapped in steel, on the other hand 
forming exogenous inclusions, are also unwanted. Extreme care and control are 
necessary to produce steel devoid of nonmetallic inclusions, which tend to seri-
ously impair mechanical properties of steel. With state-of-the-art technology, 
high performance interstitials free (IF) and extra deep drawing (EDD) grades, 
virtually free of inclusions and dissolved impurities are routinely produced in 
many steel mills around the globe. During deoxidizer addition, some silica and 
lime are also added such that an adequate ladle slag (e.g., calcium aluminosili-
cates) is formed. Such slag helps absorb nonmetallic inclusions as they fl oat up 
due to buoyancy. In addition, ladle slag also provides a protective cover over the 
melt thereby minimizing radiation losses and contamination from the ambient 
(i.e., reoxidation).
Composition and cleanliness control invariably follow primary steelmak-
ing owing to the increased demand of a diverse range of high-quality steels. For

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
example, downstream operations like conventional and/or thin slab casting demand 
stringent control of composition, cleanliness, and temperature. Chemical opera-
tions carried out in ladles as well as holding and transportation of molten steel often 
cause substantial drop in liquid steel’s temperature. Adequate corrective measures 
are required to compensate for such lost heat. Accordingly, a multifaceted activity 
generally follows beyond primary steelmaking operations. These are collectively 
referred to as “secondary steelmaking” and help bring versatility to composition and 
associated mechanical properties of steel. The total duration of secondary steelmak-
ing (i.e., deoxidation and alloying, heating, degassing, etc.) operations is long and 
often exceeds that of primary steelmaking.
Secondary steelmaking techniques are generally concerned with one or more of 
the following:
 
1. Composition adjustment: These include alloying additions for adjustment 
of melt chemistry, powder injection for desulfurization, vacuum treatment 
for removal of dissolved gases, and production of ultralow carbon steel.
 
2. Cleanliness control: This is concerned with the production of clean steel 
and involves synthetic slag preparation for better inclusion absorption, cre-
ating correct fl ows in tundish and molds to aid inclusion fl oat out and injec-
tion techniques to modify morphology and composition of oxide and sulfi de 
inclusions.
 
3. Temperature control: Melt heating is done through electrical energy. An 
arc is produced between graphite electrodes and this generates enough heat 
increasing the temperature of the melt.
Secondary steelmaking operations are carried out in a ladle furnace (LF), which 
is a refractory lined (typically magnesite), cylindrical-shaped vessel (see Figure 
1.9a). All secondary steelmaking operations have one thing in common: in one way 
or the other they utilize gas (mostly argon) that is injected* into the melt through 
one or more porous plugs. The gas rising through the liquid induces a turbulent 
recirculatory motion, which provides the necessary bath agitation for exacerbat-
ing the rates of various heat and mass transfer controlled processes (viz., melt-
ing of deoxidizer and alloying additions and their dissolution and dispersion, etc.). 
Depending on the end requirement, a wide range of gas fl ow rates is applied. Thus, 
if an intense mixing condition is desired (say, for greater desulfurization), a rela-
tively high argon fl ow rate is used (~1 Nm3/h/ton). On the other hand, for thermal 
and material homogenization, relatively low fl ow rates are needed (~0.1 Nm3/h/
ton). Intermediate fl ow rates are used during chemistry adjustment and arc heating. 
More than required gas injection increases the possibility of atmospheric reoxida-
tion, erosion of electrodes and ladle refractory, etc. Argon fl ow rate is an important 
process variable in secondary steelmaking and is controlled effectively to achieve 
superior process performance. A schematic of gas injection operation in a ladle is 
*  It is necessary to bubble argon through the porous plug from the instant molten steel is tapped in a 
ladle. Otherwise, the pores tend to get blocked making gas injection diffi cult.

shown in Figure 1.9b [10]. In many bigger size ladles (>200 ton or so) two porous 
plugs, instead of one, are applied to deliver the gas.
Typically alloying additions are made over the eye of the surfacing plume, as 
shown in Figure 1.9b. The additions melt, dissolve, and disperse in the melt under 
the infl uence of convection current induced through gas injection. The composi-
tion of the melt is closely monitored by collecting samples and analyzing these. 
Occasionally, it is desirable to remove additional sulfur from the melt to meet cus-
tomer requirement. Typically, a basic, synthetic ladle slag is prepared and argon 
is bubbled at a high rate to promote slag metal mixing, facilitating desulfurization 
according to Equation 1.6. Slag–metal contact area and the intensity of bath agita-
tion infl uence the rate of ladle desulfurization most.
During refi ning as well as transfer operations,* hydrogen and nitrogen fi nd 
their way into the melt. Their presence in the fi nal product seriously impairs the 
performance of steel. It is therefore desirable to regulate such unwanted elements 
within their acceptable limits. This is accomplished via vacuum processes com-
monly termed as “degassing” operations. Many degassing techniques are available 
on a commercial scale. These are schematically shown in Figure 1.10 [4]. Of these, 
two types of degassing processes, namely tank and circulation degassing are fre-
quently used in the industry. During treatment of melt under vacuum, the dissolved 
gases tend to escape to the ambient, which is thermodynamically favorable. Apart 
from a low operating pressure (1 mbar or so), a good level of bath agitation is very 
* The three stages of steelmaking are linked via transfer steps or operations (BOF → ladle (i.e., tap-
ping), ladle → tundish → mold (i.e., teeming)). The quality of steel achieved during one stage can be 
completely lost during a subsequent transfer operation, if the latter is not regulated properly. Transfer 
operations are of immense importance to steelmakers and their engineering is vital to fully exploit the 
benefi ts of primary and secondary steelmaking processes.

important to remove dissolved gases from the melt.* In circulation degassing pro-
cesses, the circulation of the melt provides the required stirring that is induced by the 
lifting gas. On the other hand, in tank degassing, the injected argon aids in stirring of 
the melt. For larger volume ladles, circulation degassing is relatively more effective 
than tank degassing. There are also other vacuum techniques available for adjusting 
steel chemistry and most notable among these are the vacuum oxygen decarburiza-
tion (VOD) and vacuum argon decarburization (VAD) processes. These are used 
in the production of ultralow carbon steel. The vacuum shifts the C–O equilibrium 
favorably aiding removal of carbon to produce low-carbon steel.
Steel cleanliness is adversely affected by the presence of alumina and sulfi de 
inclusions, which infl uence mechanical properties of steel. This is also true with 
any entrapped slag particles. Alumina inclusions pose many problems, such as noz-
zle clogging, during transfer operations leading to operational hazards. Present-day 
steelmakers, therefore, aim to produce steel with practically negligible contamina-
tion from alumina and sulfi de inclusions. While it is easier to fl oat and remove 
relatively larger inclusions, this is not so with inclusions of size 50 µm or less. 
To aid removal of alumina and sulfi de inclusions, calcium is injected into steel in 
the form of CaSi and CaFe wire. Dissolved calcium reacts with oxide and sulfi de 
inclusions, and changes their state (solid → liquid), morphology, shape, and size 
to facilitate their removal producing clean steel. Recovery of calcium is extremely 
poor in steelmaking environments and this tends to offset economic benefi ts.
Alloy addition, injection, and vacuum treatments involve endothermic processes 
and consume heat. These in turn lead to a substantial drop in melt temperature, to 
compensate which it is not desirable to maintain a signifi cantly higher superheat† in

the BOF as the latter adversely affects the overall economics of steelmaking. Besides, 
holding melt in a ladle causes temperature to drop at the rate of ~0.01 K/s (i.e., half a 
degree Celsius per minute). It is therefore often required to compensate the lost heat 
before continuous casting such that premature freezing is avoided and casting com-
mences at correct temperature (i.e., with a practical, low superheat). Heating of melt 
during secondary processing is carried out in a LF, operated in a manner similar to 
an electrical arc furnace described in Section 1.3.1. Depending on the ladle size and 
power ratings, the temperature of the melt can be increased by about 0.05–0.07 K/s. 
Figure 1.11 shows a typical LF. During arcing, a refractory-lined roof is used as 
a protective cover to minimize radiation losses. More details and the science and 
technology of secondary steelmaking are available in Ref. [11].
1.3.3 CASTING
Steel with a desirable temperature and composition, following secondary steelmak-
ing operations, is taken to the casting bay where molten steel is transformed into solid 
product. Traditionally, molten steel used to be cast through the ingot-casting route 
wherein individual molds are fi lled with molten steel to produce steel ingots. The 
ingots were subsequently rolled to fl at, long, and round products. For increased mill 
productivity and better energy effi ciency, practically all the steel produced today is

is to minimize, what is known in the industry as “electrode hunting” to prolong latter’s life.)

cast through continuous casting. It is estimated that switching over from ingot to con-
tinuous casting leads to energy savings of the order of 500 MJ/ton of steel produced.
In continuous casting, a ladle is placed over a tundish, which feeds one or many 
molds beneath through a submerged entry nozzle (SEN) as shown in Figure 1.12. 
The tundish, traditionally a buffer vessel, now helps improve steel cleanliness fur-
ther through fl oatation of inclusions, aided by inserting appropriate fl ow control 
devices at strategic locations. Depending on the section cast, the speed of casting 
as well as the number of molds beneath tundish varies. Typically continuous casting 
produces three different kinds of products namely slab, bloom, and billet. Specialty 
products like beam blanks are also occasionally produced. The relative section sizes 
and typical casting speeds are summarized in Table 1.3. Thus, a tundish equipped 
with a billet caster would feed many molds and casting would proceed at a relatively 
higher speed. Similarly, a tundish equipped with a slab caster would feed typically 
one or two molds and cast steel at a somewhat lower speed. The biggest challenge in 
continuous casting is to cast steel continuously without strand breakouts and other 
interruptions with the minimum of external and internal defects (i.e., various types 
of cracks, segregation, rhomboidity, mold distortion, and so on). More information 
on the same is available in Ref. [12].

The mold in continuous casting is made from copper and is water cooled. 
A part of the superheat is removed in the mold by circulating water. This facilitates 
the formation of a solid thin shell of steel that supports the strand below mold exit. 
The mold is oscillated to prevent the solidifying casting from sticking to mold wall. 
Suitably designed mold powders (also termed as mold fl uxes) are added to foster 
lubrication between mold wall and the descending strand. The strand is continuously 
withdrawn by the guide and pinch rolls while the bending rolls serve to gradually 
bend the strand upon its emergence from the mold. Immediately below the mold, the 
strand meets a series of water-mist sprays that help extract a signifi cant portion of 
heat from the moving strand, thereby solidifying steel completely. The length of the 
spray-cooling zone is about 8–10 m and is signifi cantly longer than the height of the 
mold (~1 m or so). Beyond the sprays, as the solid strand is further cooled by radia-
tion to the ambient, it is cut into required lengths by oxyacetylene torches or shear-
ing machines. Cut sections of billets, blooms, and slabs are subsequently processed 
in rolling mills and supplied to the customers in required forms and sizes.
Continuous casting machines perform vital thermal and mechanical functions. 
These are required to be controlled effectively and optimized such that defect-free 
steel can be produced on a sustained basis. Apart from conventional continuous 
casting process described above, thin slab and strip casters have also been com-
mercialized in recent years. Thin slabs (i.e., 10–50 mm width) are cast at a speed 
of 0.085–0.1 m/s, while strip casters (2–5 mm width) are operated with a speed in 
excess of 0.75–2 m/s. Ability to cast steel continuously in the form of strips helps 
eliminate subsequent processing operations (e.g., rolling, etc.) almost entirely, lead-
ing to considerable energy and cost savings.
Continuously cast slabs, blooms, and billets undergo various hot and cold 
working processes whereby a range of long, fl at, and round products are pro-
duced. A given mill may not always produce all different kinds of products. The 
fi nal product range from continuous casting is illustrated in Figure 1.13.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
1.4 MODELING IN STEELMAKING
Modeling implies scientifi c representation of a process or a phenomenon. The repre-
sentation can be either physical or mathematical. In the former, the actual process or 
phenomenon is represented via a physical system while in the latter, via mathematical 
expressions or equations. More specifi cally, in physical modeling, a given phenom-
enon is investigated in a replica of the actual industrial unit while in mathematical 
modeling a given phenomena is investigated by representing the latter via a mathe-
matical equations or expressions. Modeling is a well-established scientifi c technique 
with demonstrated capabilities and fi nds widespread application in engineering 
process analysis, design, control, and optimization.
1.4.1 PHYSICAL MODELING
A physical model of a process seeks to represent the system by changing the mate-
rials and in the majority of cases, the scale or size. In the context of steelmaking, 
physical models are popularly built with Perspex* sheet and use water to represent 
molten steel. The key objective in physical modeling is to measure and visualize one 
or many characteristics of the real system, rather inexpensively and conveniently. 
Physical modeling studies of high-temperature steelmaking provide useful insight 
into the system, which is practically impossible otherwise. For example, it is dif-
fi cult, if not impossible, to observe the subsurface trajectory of deoxidizer and alloy-
ing additions in a steel melt following their projection into a ladle during tapping.

On the other hand, one can conveniently get a reasonable idea of such trajectories by 
projecting representative, similar shaped, solid particles in an appropriately scaled 
water model system. Besides, many a time, physical modeling is carried out to 
measure the characteristic of the system that can then be applied to validate a mathe-
matical model. This has become a popular approach in steelmaking process research 
and hence, physical modeling and mathematical modeling are frequently applied in 
conjunction, as it is generally diffi cult to derive validation dataset from industrial-
scale operations.
1.4.2 MATHEMATICAL MODELING
A mathematical model is a set of equations, algebraic or differential, which may be 
used to represent and predict certain phenomena. The term model as opposed to law 
implies that the relationship employed in the mathematical expressions may not be 
quite exact and therefore, the predictions derived from them may only be approxi-
mate. The adequacy and appropriateness of a mathematical model largely depends 
on how rigorously the model has been formulated (i.e., to what extent the physics of 
the process has been embodied in formulating the equations).
Steelmaking is a complex process and involves multiphase turbulent fl ow, heat, 
and mass transfer as well as chemical reactions among slag, metal, gas, and solid. 
Accordingly, numerous idealizations are applied to formulate reasonably realistic 
process models in steelmaking. Classical mathematics is rarely useful for solving 
model equations and numerical techniques are invariably applied. Without robust 
software and powerful digital computers, there would be little hope of predicting 
many phenomena of practical interest. In recent years, major breakthroughs in math-
ematical modeling have been possible because of effi cient solution algorithms and 
user-friendly, powerful computational softwares as well reasonably priced high-
performance computers. Mathematical modeling offers many distinct advantages 
[13] and the following are notable among them.
 
1. Low cost: In many applications the cost of running a computer program/
code is many orders of magnitude lower than that of a corresponding exper-
imental investigation, particularly if experiments are to be conducted in 
full-scale steel processing vessels.
 
2. Remarkable speed: A researcher can study the implications of hundreds of 
different confi gurations via a mathematical model in a very short time. In 
contrast, detailed experimental observations (which are also not possible 
many a time) involve many man months.
 
3. Simulation of real conditions: In a computational procedure, there is very 
little diffi culty in having a very low or high temperature, large or small 
vessel dimensions, etc. Thus, a full-scale system with liquid steel as 
the fl uid can be modeled as conveniently as a reduced scale model with 
water.
 
4. Complete information: Results can be derived throughout the domain of 
interest. There are no inaccessible locations in a computer simulation. 
Similarly, there is no counterpart of fl ow disturbance caused by a probe.
  

20 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Various types of mathematical models are applied in steelmaking process analysis, 
design, optimization, and control. These include
 
1. Computational fl uid dynamics based models for simulation of reacting 
turbulent fl ows and transport
 
2. AI-based models for process control and optimization
 
3. Thermodynamic models for equilibrium calculation
 
4. Reduced order models for automation and control in the shop fl oor
In addition to those models, altogether different modeling approaches are adapted 
to simulate processing beyond solidifi cation including mechanical working, micro-
structural and textural evolution, etc. It is not possible to cover all such topics in 
reasonable details in a singular work. Accordingly, the present chapter primarily 
emphasizes 1 and 2.
Process analysis and optimization involve mathematical modeling primarily in an 
off-line fashion. In contrast, process control requires modeling and prediction in real 
time. Models in category 1 are in general far too complex and therefore, not suited 
for real-time applications in steelmaking process control. Online control requires 
simpler models and in such context, reduced order models have made it to the shop 
fl oor. Popularly used methods in the latter category include
 
1. Heat and material balance
 
2. Lagrange response rate analysis
 
3. Predictor-corrector controller
 
4. Statistical self-learning
1.4.3 PILOT-SCALE TRIALS
Large-scale experimentation in full-scale steel processing units is prohibitively 
expensive and cumbersome. Instead, pilot-scale trials are conducted, provided 
resources are available. Pilot-scale vessels are generally 5%–15% of the full-scale 
system, in which the actual process is simulated. Unlike physical modeling, the mate-
rial used is essentially the same as those in the full-scale system. Pilot-scale systems 
are expensive to build and operate, and conducting trials on these particularly at 
elevated temperatures, are as cumbersome as in full-scale systems. Nonavailability 
of low-cost measuring probes capable of working in high-temperature environment 
on a sustained basis poses additional problems. Physical and mathematical model-
ing, although useful, do not alone constitute the requisite framework, particularly if 
the ultimate objective of modeling is to do the following [14]:
 
1. Develop altogether a new process
 
2. Carry out measurements and modifi cations which, hitherto, are diffi cult in 
an existing process
 
3. Launch a new product in the market and an assessment of market potential 
before a large-scale commercial production is initiated
  

Steelmaking, Modeling, and Measurements 
21
Indeed, in the development and commercialization of many iron and steelmaking 
technologies, from sponge iron making to thin strip casting, an integrated approach 
embodying physical modeling, mathematical modeling, and pilot-scale experimen-
tations has been applied. A rigorous approach in steelmaking process analysis and 
design must embody the three above-mentioned components, as is illustrated in 
Figure 1.14.
In the absence of such approaches, engineering of steelmaking per se involves 
conducting large-scale experimentation in actual steel processing units. As desired 
performance can be arrived at through many trials, involving several man months 
and exorbitantly high costs, there is a defi nite need for effective and time-intensive 
research and development efforts. While many early developments in iron and steel-
making were the results of direct high-temperature trials (of course on smaller scales), 
more recent developments, on the other hand, owe their success and commercialization 
to an approach that embodies a judicial blend of modeling and high-temperature trials. 
It is certainly not desirable to begin any exploratory work on process optimization, 
control, or design in full-scale or pilot-scale vessels.
1.5 MEASUREMENTS
Modeling is used to gain useful insight into a process or a phenomenon rapidly, in a 
cost-effective manner. Its relevance to steelmaking is readily appreciated since visual 
opacity, high operating temperature, and relatively large size of steel processing ves-
sels often preclude direct observation. However, without companion measurements, 
modeling is incomplete and unsatisfactory. Measurements allow us to observe the 
reality. The most reliable information about any aspect of steel processing can only 
be acquired through measurements. Models and measurements are naturally there-
fore regarded as interdependent components of a process investigation.
A diverse range of off-line and online measurements are routinely carried out 
in the industry. These are used to monitor, automate, and control steelmaking pro-
cesses. Thus, pressure, temperature, composition, volumetric fl ow, speed, force,

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
position, shape, and thickness, etc. are routinely measured in steel plants. Various 
types of measurements and measuring devices commonly used in the steel industry 
are summarized in Table 1.4. The major challenge in measurements is the design of 
low-cost probes (i.e., measuring devices), capable of working on a sustained basis in 
steelmaking environment. Rapidity and reproducibility of industrial-scale measure-
ments are also important issues in such context. Measurements and their relevance to 
BOF process control are illustrated in Figure 1.15 [15]. Parallel to the above, various 
types of measurements and measuring devices are used in room temperature studies 
of steelmaking. Although described later in detail in Chapter 3, a summary of these 
is presented in Table 1.5.
1.6 STEELMAKING AND THE FUTURE
The current practice of hot metal refi ning and steelmaking is signifi cantly different 
from what was practiced nearly 50 years back, when LD steelmaking was fi rst intro-
duced. Indeed, sophisticated, modern, liquid steel production systems that enable 
various adaptations to meet present-day economic and ecological requirements, have 
outgrown, the originally very simplistic LD process. In this remarkable journey, 
models, sensors, computers, and softwares have played crucial roles in practically 
every aspect of steelmaking.
Higher productivity and superior product quality are interlined with effi cient 
process control. The latter ensures shorter tap-to-tap time, correct end composition 
and temperature, better steel cleanliness, defect-free casting, etc. Nearly 50 years 
back, LD heat (i.e., oxygen pressure, amount of scrap, lance height, etc.) was statically

any deviation in real practice is addressed through a dynamic (or an online) process 
model used to evaluate corrective measures needed to achieve correct end blow point 
(i.e., to pinpoint the instant when oxygen blowing is to be stopped). To achieve satis-
factory results, it is essential to have proven methods of direct and continuous mea-
surements of temperature and composition of the bath. The future years will witness

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
large-scale efforts concerned with the development of such measuring devices 
and an increasing application of process models to effectively control and automate 
steelmaking technology.
Environmental aspects were and have been a serious challenge for steelmakers. 
Large volume of gases and dust are generated during various stages of steelmaking 
(oxygen steelmaking, tapping, desulfurization through carbide injection, LF opera-
tions, and alloy additions) and in this, the converter steelmaking assumes a preemi-
nent position. Effi cient gas cleaning plants or dedusting systems are required such 
that clean converter gas, practically free of dust and sulfur, that can replenish energy 
sources in steel plants can be produced. Converter off gases, dust and slag, etc. are 
valuable by-products of the steel plants that can help conserve energy and natu-
ral resources in an effective manner and therefore require serious considerations. 
Similarly, human involvement in risk-prone area and hazardous environment should 
be as little as possible. Serious efforts in robotics and automation are therefore called 
for. If steel has to remain competitive, efforts related to better productivity and prod-
uct quality must culminate with a smaller specifi c energy requirement (particularly, 
EAF, rolling mill operation, etc.), zero waste, and 100% recycling. Modeling will be 
a key player in many futuristic developments on these fronts.
In the foreseeable future, EAFs and oxygen steelmaking will continue to domi-
nate the steelmaking scenario, as no new technology is presently in sight. Although 
increased productivity through enhanced process performance, reduced yield losses, 
etc. will continue to assume importance, increasing thrust on the following are 
expected due to greater economic and environmental constraints.
 
1. Consistent productivity and quality
 
2. Zero emission
 
3. 100% recycling
 
4. Reduced specifi c energy consumption
As we march ahead toward an era of automated, effi cient, and green steelmaking, 
there is an increasing need for superior process control strategies in order to achieve 
consistent product quality coupled with maximum yield, optimum cost, minimum 
impact on the environment, smaller specifi c energy consumption, etc. In such 
efforts, modeling is likely to play pivotal roles and embraced in the industry as well 
as research and development on an ever-increasing scale. Successful new strategies 
are expected to evolve from a knowledge-based foundation encapsulating models, 
measurements, and steelmaking principles and practices, as already illustrated in 
Figure 1.1.
1.7 CONCLUDING REMARKS

are outlined and a brief account of steelmaking technology is presented under three 
separate headings namely, primary steelmaking, deoxidation, and secondary steel-
making and casting. Under primary steelmaking, both BOS and EAF technology 
are described. Deoxidation and secondary refi ning are addressed subsequently

and their relevance to productivity and quality is highlighted. Finally, Continuous 
casting process together with emerging casting technologies is briefl y mentioned. 
Following such, an introduction to models and measurements, as two interdependent 
components of a steelmaking process investigation, is presented. The role of models, 
sensors, and computers in futuristic developments concerning emission, recycling, 
energy consumption, etc. is highlighted. It is emphasized that a sound understanding 
of the fundamental aspects of steelmaking, modeling, and measurements is a prereq-
uisite to any serious research and development efforts in steelmaking.

2 Knowledge-Based 
Foundation of 
Steelmaking
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Production of liquid steel at every stage (i.e., convert steelmaking, ladle  metallurgy, 
continuous casting, etc.) involves interactions among various phases, such as metal, 
slag, and gas, in which fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer, chemical reaction, etc. 
all playing important roles. Comprehensive understanding of steelmaking neces-
sitates a sound knowledge of metallurgical thermodynamics and rate phenomena 
(i.e., fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer). Modeling of steelmaking per se is not pos-
sible without a good grasp of steelmaking practice as well as the underlying sci-
entifi c fundamentals. It is therefore desirable to briefl y review the science behind 
steelmaking fi rst.
The fundamentals are suffi ciently broad based and hence it is not possible to 
provide a comprehensive account of these. Also, there exist a large number of 
excellent books on thermodynamics, fl uid mechanics, and rate phenomena. The 
discussion here has therefore been restricted to an introductory level, focusing 
some of the key concepts that are central to the modeling of steelmaking pro-
cesses. As an introduction, a few topics from metallurgical thermodynamics are 
presented, following which theories of fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer, and 
chemical kinetics are discussed. A section on gas injection into liquids and gas–
liquid interaction is included as the fi nal topic owing to its unique relevance to 
steelmaking. A few worked examples are presented in each section to elucidate 
the underlying concepts better.
2.2 METALLURGICAL THERMODYNAMICS
Principles of thermodynamics are employed in steelmaking to predict the feasibility 
of a chemical reaction or a process. It also permits a quantitative calculation of the 
state of equilibrium of a system in terms of its composition, pressure, and tempera-
ture. Thermodynamics allows us to determine heat effects of chemical reactions 
as well. Laws of thermodynamics are exact, and therefore calculations based on 
them are in principle accurate and reliable. In the following, a few topics relevant to 
steelmaking are briefl y presented. More elaborate discussion on these is available 
elsewhere [1–3].

The standard state is the most stable state of a species at the same temperature T and 
a pressure of 1 atm. This implies that the standard state could be a pure solid or a 
liquid or an ideal gas at 1 atm pressure. Activities aL, aM, etc. are expressed as ratios 
of fugacity at the state under consideration to that at the standard state. Therefore, 
if all reactants and products are at their standard state, their respective activities 
become equal to unity (i.e., RT ln aL → 0) and under such a condition, Equation 2.9

2.2.3 STANDARD FREE ENERGY CHANGE (DGO) FOR OXIDES
In steelmaking, numerous chemical reactions between different elements and oxy-
gen are involved. For example, when Fe, Si, P, Mn, etc. oxidize to their respective 
oxides in primary steelmaking, reactions between dissolved oxygen and deoxi-
dizer elements are common in deoxidation of steel. The standard free energy of 
formation of various oxides is therefore important and constitutes data for thermo-
dynamic analysis of steelmaking. Accordingly, the standard free energy change 
for a chemical reaction between different elements and oxygen, when these and 
reaction products are in their standard state (i.e., pure), has been experimentally 
determined and tabulated over a range of temperatures. On that basis, thermody-
namic calculations on various metal–metal oxide systems, of relevance to steel-
making, are carried out.
Consider, therefore, the formation of an oxide from its elements, represented in its 
most general form by Equation 2.16:

in which A and B are constants. Standard free energy formation of various oxides 
are compiled and reported in accordance with Equations 2.16 and 2.17. A plot of 
∆Go
f  against temperature (commonly referred to as the oxide Ellingham diagram) 
for some selected oxides is shown in Figure 2.1 [4]. There, each line is drawn for 
oxidation of an individual element in accordance with Equation 2.16 considering 
1 mol of oxygen as the basis. As a result, comparison of free energy formation among 
various oxides becomes convenient. For example, a relatively lower position of a line 
in the Ellingham diagram indicates greater stability of an oxide phase. Therefore, 
Al2O3 is more stable than SiO2, since the free energy of formation of the former is 
more negative than that of the latter. Conversely, reduction of Al2O3, say by CO, is 
more diffi cult than it is for SiO2. In addition, the Ellingham diagram provides useful

Such estimates indicate that pure liquid iron at 1873 K is spontaneously converted 
to an iron oxide (FeO) in normal atmosphere. Conversely, oxygen in trace concentra-
tions has the potential to oxidize pure iron at such a temperature. This is so as iron 
has suffi ciently high affi nity toward oxygen.
2.2.4 ACTIVITY–COMPOSITION RELATIONSHIPS
Reactions between pure phases are rare in practice. For example, silicon dissolved 
in steel (e.g., a multicomponent solution comprising Fe, Si, Mn, P, S, etc.) oxidizes 
during steelmaking and forms silica that stays as a compound in the slag phase (i.e., 
as CaO–SiO2 and other complex oxysilicates).* In such a situation, an assessment 
of feasibility of silicon oxidation at steelmaking temperature is not possible on the 
basis of standard free energy change data presented in Figure 2.1. For actual systems, 
in which elements and compounds are not present in their pure state, free energy 
change will have to be calculated via Equation 2.12 embodying known relationship 
between activity and composition. Specifi c laws or models exist and based on that, 
activity–composition (or concentration) relationship needed for practical thermody-
namic calculations is deduced. In this context, concentrated as well as dilute solution 
models are briefl y discussed below.
2.2.4.1 Concentrated Solutions
Activity of a species in a solution can be loosely interpreted as a measure of its 
“free concentration” that is available to take part in a chemical reaction. Activity, by 
defi nition is dimensionless (i.e., it is a ratio of fugacity at two different states) and is 
equal to unity at the standard state. As mentioned earlier, conventional standard state 
is the pure state (e.g., a pure element or a compound).
An ideal solution is one that obeys Raoult’s law, according to which the activity 
of a species is equivalent to its mole fraction. Mathematically,
 
i
i
a
X
=
 
(2.18)
* In pure silica, while activity of silica is unity, in steelmaking slag this is generally smaller than unity, 
as silica in slag exists in combination with other oxides. Molten slags are solutions of several oxides 
and are therefore truly multicomponent systems. Ternary and quaternary phase diagrams are needed 
for activity–composition relationship for various slag components. Slag atlas is a useful resource in 
such contexts.
  

36 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Evidently, in the pure state (i.e., the conventional standard state), the mole fraction* 
and hence the activity are both a unity. Ideal solutions are rare (typical examples 
of interest here are Fe–Mn, FeO–MnO systems, etc.) and most solutions in reality 
exhibit departure or deviation from the ideal behavior or Raout’s law. This is shown 
in Figure 2.2, where negative and positive deviations from ideality are illustrated 
schematically. Such departures are accommodated via an “activity coeffi cient” 
defi ned as
 
i
i
i
a
X
γ =
 
(2.19)
Activities in slag systems employ a conventional standard state as reference. 
However, since steelmaking slags are multicomponent systems, presentation of 
activity–composition diagrams is not as straightforward as shown in Figure 2.2.
2.2.4.2 Dilute Solutions
Molten steel, as opposed to slags, is a dilute solution in which, the concentration of 
different solutes (i.e., C, O, Mn, etc.) rarely (barring some grades of high alloy steels) 
exceed 1 wt % or so. In dilute binary solutions, a solute obeys Henry’s law which is 
stated mathematically as follows:

in which, 
o
iγ , is a constant. Activities of various species in solutions of inter-
est to steelmaking are expressed in terms of either Raoult’s law or Henry’s law. 
However, for the sake of convenience, often a wt % scale is used in lieu of a mole 
fraction scale for expressing composition. In the wt % scale, a new standard state 
is defi ned at 1 wt % such that as the composition reaches 1 wt %, the activity 
assumes a value of unity. In terms of the new weight percent scale, Henry’s law 
is expressed as
 
wt %

This is represented in Figure 2.3 by the straight line in the limit of wt % i or Xi tends

due to the presence of additional solutes and their infl uence, and is mathematically 
expressed as

in which, fi is the activity coeffi cient in the 1 wt % standard state. If Henry’s law is

energy change for any chemical reaction is a function of the defi nition of standard 
state.* For binary systems, as pointed out earlier, up to 1 wt % standard state, Henry’s

law is obeyed and Equation 2.21 is applied to infer the activity. In the presence of 
additional solute elements, departure from Henry’s law occurs even at levels smaller 
than 1 wt % due to solute–solute interactions and we are then obliged to use Equation 
2.22 instead of Equation 2.21. The value of the activity coeffi cient, fi, is however 
needed to account for such a departure.
The infl uence of one solute on the activity of another, particularly in dilute 
 solutions, is of considerable practical relevance to steelmakers and has been exten-
sively studied both theoretically and experimentally. In a multicomponent solution 
with A as solvent and B, C, D,…, i, j, …, etc. as solutes, the activity coeffi cient of a 
species “i” is expressed as

In order to carry out thermodynamic calculations under steelmaking conditions, 
thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy changes, standard free energy 
changes, interaction parameters, etc. are needed. Moreover, many a time, equations 
are complex and computational methods are employed. Many present-day ther-
mochemical databases* integrate application software and these come handy particu-
larly if calculations are lengthy and complex. Currently, Web- or PC-based databases 
are routinely employed to carry out thermodynamic evaluations of steelmaking 
processes. A list of popular databases in chemical thermodynamics is presented in 
Table 2.1.
2.2.5 CHEMICAL POTENTIAL AND EQUILIBRIUM
The feasibility of chemical processes and an assessment of equilibrium are also 
often made from the standpoint of chemical potential. Consider a slag metal reac-
tion involving transfer of a species “i” from the metal phase to the slag phase. 
Thermodynamically, this is possible provided

(2.24)
in which (µi) and [µi] denote the chemical potential of species “i” dissolved in the 
slag phase and the metal phase, respectively.
* Thermodynamic evaluation of multicomponent systems often leads to a large number of mutually 
coupled nonlinear algebraic equations. Also transcendental equations of the type, x + log x = constant, 
are encountered. Their solution necessitates computational techniques.
  

Knowledge-Based Foundation of Steelmaking

Chemical potential follows a similar relationship with activity as partial molar 
free energy does. Therefore, in the spirit of Equation 2.10, a relationship of the fol-
lowing type works out between the chemical potential and activity, i.e.,
 
o

(2.26)
This implies that at equilibrium the activity of transferring species in the phases is 
equal.
In iron and steelmaking, the term “oxygen potential” or “chemical potential of 
oxygen” is frequently used to assess transfer of oxygen from one phase to another. 
For example, during refi ning processes in primary steelmaking, oxygen potential in 
the gas phase is signifi cantly higher than that in the melt phase. This facilitates easy 
transfer of oxygen from the gas to the melt leading to the oxidation of impure ele-
ments. The defi nition of oxygen potential and its estimation are illustrated in Worked 
Example 2.2.

Therefore, at any desired temperature, taking Rg = 8.314 kJ/kg mol · K, we 
can readily estimate the oxygen potential in the atmosphere.

gen (i.e., the corresponding activity) is known. The partial pressure of oxygen 
in the gas phase in equilibrium with a given amount of dissolved oxygen in 
the melt is estimated from thermodynamics. On that basis, chemical poten-
tial of oxygen in steel is readily calculated. To explain this further, let us 
consider the following chemical reaction at equilibrium:

2.3 FLUID DYNAMICS
2.3.1 FLUID FLOW PHENOMENA IN STEELMAKING
Steelmaking embodies refi ning of hot metal in furnaces and ladles and casting of 
molten steel through continuous casting to produce billets, blooms, slabs, and so on. 
The solidifi ed products are subsequently subjected to a variety of heat treatments, 
mechanical working, and surface-fi nishing operations for their conversion into fi nal 
fi nished form. A variety of high temperature processing operations are therefore 
encountered in steelmaking. Of these, hot metal refi ning is generally mass transfer 
controlled and hence the associated kinetics depends signifi cantly on the state of 
fl uid motion in steelmaking reactors. The effi ciency of typical processing opera-
tions such as melting of scarp, alloying and deoxidizer additions, their dissolution, 
thermal and material mixing, inclusion fl oat out, etc. as well as transfer operations 
such as tapping and teeming are intricately related to the state of fl uid motion.
Flows in furnaces, ladles, etc. are the consequences of different forces acting on 
such systems. Thus, while a supersonic jet of oxygen impinges on the bath surface 
to cause intense stirring in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) (Section 1.3.1), large-scale 
momentum transfer from the falling jet of liquid steel sets up strong convection cur-
rents within a holding ladle (Section 1.3.2) during tapping. In contrast, relatively 
weak fl ows result in ladles during secondary refi ning operations* due to inert gas 
injection as well as during holding periods due to thermal natural convection. These 
are summarized in Table 2.2. Moderately intense fl ows make the associated Reynolds

number suffi ciently large and therefore, the resultant fl ow turbulent* as the size of 
industrial steel processing units is large and kinematic viscosity of steel is small 
(∼10−6 m2/s). Interactions between injected gas and melt, intermixing of slag and 
metal, etc. lead to multiphase fl ows, which are at times transient or unsteady. For 
example, while fl ows in tundish or continuous casting mold during a long sequence 
casting are practically steady, those during furnace tapping or initial stages of argon 
bubbling are typically unsteady. Furthermore, chemical reactions and nonisother-
mality encountered frequently also induce convection currents.† Multidimensional, 
multiphase, reacting turbulent fl ow phenomena are therefore integral to steelmaking 
systems.
* While this is largely true, the reader is urged to note that the level of agitation is never uniform in a 
given vessel. For example, while intense stirring prevails in the vicinity of a ladle shroud in a tundish, 
far away, the level of agitation is relatively weak and this does affect turbulence phenomena in the 
system.
† Chemical reaction produces new phases and is associated with endothermic or exothermic heat effects. 
These induce density variation in the systems and infl uence the fl ow in a manner analogous to thermal 
natural convection.

Process calculations in steelmaking demand a priori knowledge of fl ow. The later is 
derived generally from two different standpoints namely, experimental measurement 
and numerical calculation (popularly referred to as CFD). Comprehensive measure-
ments of fl ows in steel processing units are extremely diffi cult due to high operating 
temperatures, relatively large size of steel processing vessels, etc. Nonavailability of 
reliable probes capable of performing in steelmaking environment on a sustained 
basis poses additional diffi culties to in-situ measurements. Computational fl uid 
dynamics is therefore the preferred approach and is widely popular in steelmak-
ing process analysis, modeling, and design. However, rigorous modeling of fl ows in 
steelmaking reactors, interwoven with so many complexities, is neither straightfor-
ward nor easy and warrants comprehensive understanding of fl uid fl ow phenomena. 
Theory of fl uid fl ow including advanced topics such as multiphase fl ows, turbulence, 
etc. are dealt with elaborately in numerous books, research monographs, and articles. 
A few among these are cited here [5–7] for further reading.
Experimental measurements are prone to error due to the sensitivity of equip-
ments, personal effects, and so on. Similarly, a theoretical approach, may also lead 
to uncertainty, particularly if the theoretical basis is not rigorous. For example, fl ow 
calculation in steelmaking relies on rate constants, thermophysical properties, inter-
phase exchange coeffi cients (such as drag coeffi cient, etc.), and so on. In addition, 
considerable idealizations go into model building (enumerated in later chapters) and 
all these tend to induce uncertainty. However, with the advancement of knowledge 
and our continued improved understanding of the underlying physics, it is currently 
possible to do away with many uncertainties and ambiguities making simulation of 
steelmaking reasonably realistic.
2.3.2 CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM AND THE NAVIER–STOKES EQUATIONS
Flow of a fl uid is the result of forces acting on a fl uid element. A logical quantitative 
description of fl ows therefore starts from the principles of conservation of momen-
tum. On the basis of Newton’s second law of motion, this is expressed, in appropriate 
vector notation, as

Various types of forces work on a fl uid element. Some of these operate through sur-
faces (viz., pressure, shear stresses, etc.) while others work within the entire body or 
volume of the elements (i.e., buoyancy, gravity, Lorentz force, etc.). In a given fl ow 
problem, all such forces may or may not be relevant. Force being a vector, three 
different components result from Equation 2.27 for a three-dimensional (3-D) fl ow. 
Newton’s second law is applicable to each individual phase, and accordingly force 
balance equations specifi c to each phase could be written. The equations are inter-
related via appropriate interphase momentum exchange terms due to interactions 
among various phases (e.g., drag between rising bubbles and surrounding liquid con-
stitutes one of the interphase momentum exchange phenomena in two-phase gas–
liquid fl ows). For a single-phase fl ow continuum shown in Figure 2.4 in which only

Considering a Newtonian fl ow,* Stokes equation† is invoked to replace stress, τ interns 
of relevant velocity gradients in Equation 2.28. This allows us to express force bal-
ance or momentum conservation equations solely in terms of velocity  components as 
opposed to both velocity and stress expressed in Equation 2.28. For an incompress-
ible fl uid, Equation 2.28 is expressed in expanded forms, in terms of the Cartesian 
coordinate system as

rate of strain) and incompressible liquid, i.e., density is constant, such that

The overall continuity and the three momentum conservation equations represent a 
Newtonian, incompressible, 3-D, and time-dependent fl ow. These as such represent a 
set of well-posed physical problems and are in principle solved with a set of suitable 
initial and boundary conditions. Here, we have a system of four equations and four 
unknowns corresponding to the dependent variables vx, vy, vz, and p, respectively. It is 
also apparent from the above that although pressure appears as an explicit variable, 
there is no direct equation for pressure. The pressure fi eld governs the fl ow and is 
implicitly specifi ed through the continuity.* Equations 2.30 through 2.32 are referred 
to as the Navier–Stokes equations.
Momentum conservation equations presented above are considerably simplifi ed 
to represent many classical fl uid dynamic situations such as fully developed, inviscid, 
* This implies that the momentum conservation equations in conjunction with a correct pressure fi eld 
produce a velocity fi eld that exactly satisfi es the overall continuity. In other words, given the correct 
pressure fi eld, information contained in the overall continuity equation becomes irrelevant.

and irrotational fl ows. Simplifi cations are however rarely possible in steelmaking 
and therefore, it is often necessary to solve the full form of the 3-D Navier–Stokes 
equations. The governing fl ow equations are mutually coupled and nonlinear, and 
therefore defy analytical solution.
2.3.3 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Initial and boundary conditions are required on each dependent variable to complete 
the statement of the fl ow problem. Two issues that assume importance here are the 
required number of conditions and their mathematical representation. The number 
of initial and boundary conditions on a dependent variable is derived by noting the 
highest order of its derivatives in time and space. This is explained in Table 2.3. 
A transient, 3-D, fully elliptic partial differential equation (p.d.e), i.e., Equation 
2.30 requires one initial and six boundary conditions. Therefore, altogether, 21 such 
conditions are required on vx, vy, and vz, respectively (i.e., on the three momentum 
conservation equations). Initial and boundary conditions are problem specifi c and 
therefore vary from one situation to another.
Boundary conditions are mathematically defi ned on the basis of either velocity 
components or their gradients at the system boundaries. While numerous types of fl ow 
boundaries are possible in practical problems, solid wall, free surface, inlet and outlet 
are by far the most common types in steelmaking. This is illustrated in Figure 2.5, 
in which various types of boundaries with reference to a steelmaking tundish is illus-
trated. At all such surfaces, individual velocity components or their gradients are 
assumed to be known. For example, at stationary solid walls, while a zero veloc-
ity (i.e., no slip) condition is customarily applied, at the free surface a zero veloc-
ity gradient on tangential fl ow components (equivalent to zero shear stress) is often 
imposed. Boundary conditions with specifi c reference to different steelmaking fl ow 
geometries are discussed further in Chapter 4.
2.3.4 TURBULENT FLOW AND REYNOLDS (RANS) EQUATIONS
Laminar fl ow is observed at low fl uid velocities while turbulent fl ow at higher veloci-
ties. The former is characterized by distinct streamlines with no cross-fl ow or

* “Eddies” are typically pockets of fl uid that exhibit random, 3-D motion in a turbulent fl ow. It is because 
of such, the rates of heat and mass transfer in turbulent fl ows are often several orders of magnitude 
larger than those in laminar fl ows. More discussion on this and related topics are available in [8].

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
large Reynolds number (typically greater than 2500–3000 in pipe fl ow problems) 
implies turbulent fl ow. As pointed out earlier, fl ows in steelmaking furnaces, ladles, 
etc. are invariably turbulent as extremely small kinematic viscosity of steel, large 
reactor size, and an appreciable fl ow intensity make Reynolds number of the fl ow 
large.
The phenomena of fl uid turbulence are inherently 3-D and time dependent. As far 
as calculation of turbulent fl ows is concerned the momentum conservation equations 
presented earlier suffi ce. Since turbulence involves 3-D motions of a wide range 
of eddy sizes, it is imperative that an extremely fi ne numerical grid is required in 
the numerical solution scheme to resolve turbulence motion accurately across the 
entire spectrum of eddy sizes. This necessitates large computer memory and time 
and therefore, often not practically feasible* particularly for large computational 
domains. Consequently, starting with the Navier–Stokes equation, calculation of 
turbulent fl ows is yet not a very practical proposition in steelmaking. Instead, time-
averaged form of Equation 2.30, etc. is frequently adapted. The derivation of time-
averaged Navier–Stokes or Reynolds-average Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations is 
briefl y outlined below.
The variation of say, the z-component of a fl ow with time for two different kinds 
of motion i.e., steady laminar and turbulent fl ows is shown in Figure 2.7. These 
suggest that the steady turbulent fl ow is characterized by a constant, time-average 
velocity, while the instantaneous velocity exhibiting random fl uctuations. A time-
averaged z-velocity, v− 
z is defi ned under such a condition as
* Rigorous calculation of turbulent fl ows on the basis of the Navier–Stokes equations is referred to as 
direct numerical simulation (DNS) or simply, direct simulation.

time-averaged turbulent fl ow equations becomes essentially identical to those of

and are required to be calculated simultaneously with principal fl ow variables 
v− 
x, v− 
y,  etc. Additional equations or expressions are therefore needed. This brings us 
to the domain of turbulence modeling, concerned primarily with the calculation of 
Reynolds or turbulent stresses in the fl ow fi eld. A RANS-based calculation proce-
dure embodies time-averaged equations of motion, a turbulence model and a set of 
appropriate initial and boundary conditions.

Figure 2.8 shows fi lling of a cylindrical-shaped vessel through an axisymetrically

fl ow properties do not vary in the angular direction or θ coordinate, hence

Time averaging produces three additional Reynolds stress terms, which are subse-
quently expressed in terms of a turbulence viscosity and the relevant velocity gradi-
ents (i.e., the mean strain rate). Decomposition of the Reynolds stresses thus produces 
six terms; three of these are identical to the three diffusion terms on the right-hand 
side, except for their associated diffusion coeffi cient, i.e., µt. Since µe = µ + µt, 
the turbulent diffusion terms are merged with their laminar counterpart leading to 
an equation essentially similar to the starting momentum conservation equation. The 
resultant time-averaged equation is expressed as

2.3.5 PREDICTION OF TURBULENT FLOW AND TURBULENCE MODELS
The RANS-based approach is by far the most popular in turbulent fl ow modeling. 
The RANS approach, as outlined above, requires a turbulence model to approximate 
Reynolds stresses, i.e., −
′ ′
z
r
v v
ρ
, etc. Direct numerical simulation (DNS), on the other 
hand, calculates the instantaneous turbulent fl ow directly from the Navier–Stokes 
equations. DNS approach, although much rigorous, is still not feasible for every prac-
tical problem.* Between the two approaches, there is large eddy simulation (LES) 
that combines the features of both time averaging as well as the DNS. In the follow-
ing, a brief outline of turbulence modeling is presented. More details are available 
elsewhere [9–11].
The eddy viscosity hypothesis was fi rst enunciated by Boussinesq [12], wherein, 
the Reynolds stresses in turbulent motion are derived from an analogy with molec-
ular diffusion† and expressed via a gradient formulation.‡ For example, in a 2-D 
boundary layer type fl ow, the only signifi cant turbulent shear stress −

 is 
expressed as

y  
(2.40)
in which
∂v− x  / ∂y is the mean strain rate or velocity gradient
µt is the proportionality constant
The latter parameter is termed as the turbulence or eddy viscosity which, unlike 
dynamic viscosity, µ, is not a constant but depends on the fl ow and varies from one 
location to another. Generalized expressions for various Reynolds stress compo-
nents in a multidimensional fl ow are described in a manner similar to the Stokes 
equations and are available in [9,11]. These allow Reynolds stresses appearing in the 
time-averaged momentum conservation equations to be replaced by mean velocity 
gradients and eddy or turbulence viscosity. The principle has been illustrated in 
Worked Example 2.3 already. The effective viscosity, µe, is the sum of the lami-
nar and turbulence viscosity (i.e., µ + µt) and is generally signifi cantly larger than 
the dynamic viscosity. Therefore, µe and µt can be taken to be practically equiva-
lent. Given that, we can generalize that a RANS-based 3-D fl ow model embodies 
four p.d.e (i.e., three equations of motion and an equation of continuity) in which, 
fi ve different unknowns (viz., three velocity components, pressure, and turbulence 
* Computational cost increases as the cube of Reynolds number.
† It is often debated that mean free paths of molecules or atoms are not identical to those of the randomly 
moving eddies and therefore, analogy with molecular motion is not suffi ciently rigorous. This is gener-
ally considered to be a major premise of weakness in the eddy viscosity hypothesis.
‡ Diffusion obeys a gradient-type law. Turbulent momentum, heat and mass fl uxes thus formulated, i.e., 
Equation 2.40 are therefore appropriately referred to as “eddy diffusion” of momentum, energy, and mass.
  

54

viscosity) appear. This implies that distribution of eddy viscosity in the fl ow domain 
is needed to solve the fl ow and continuity equations. The eddy viscosity comes from 
a turbulence model. According to Prandtl’s mixing length hypothesis [13], eddy 
kinematic viscosity, νt(=µt/ρ), is proportional to the length scale, lˆ, and the velocity 
scale, vˆ , of the turbulent motion. Therefore,
 
t
ˆˆvl
ν ∞
 
(2.41)
The constant of proportionality in Equation 2.41 is the universal dissipation rate 
constant and is designated by Cµ. The distribution of vˆ and lˆ are therefore needed to 
quantify eddy viscosity. To this end, a number of approaches exist. These are briefl y 
reviewed below.
2.3.5.1 Algebraic or Zero-Order Model
Algebraic or bulk effective viscosity models are the simplest of all eddy viscosity 
models and provide a global value of turbulence viscosity, µt, in the fl ow domain. 
Although, a uniform turbulence or eddy viscosity contradicts the very premise of tur-
bulence modeling (e.g., turbulence viscosity unlike dynamic viscosity is a spatially 
varying, fl ow-dependant property), the concept is useful particularly in exploratory 
studies of complex turbulent fl ows as fi rst-hand estimates of fl ow could be derived 
with a signifi cantly reduced effort.
Bulk effective viscosity model provides estimates of effective viscosity in 
terms of the key operating variables. A few such models are available for swirling 
duct fl ows, gas stirred ladles, and so on. Such models tend to be geometry specifi c 
and embody considerable amount of idealism and empiricism. For example, the 
bulk effective viscosity model for a gas stirred ladle [14] (Section 8.3.2) is repre-
sented as

(2.42)
in which
Q is the gas fl ow rate
L is the depth of the liquid
R is the radius of the ladle
Equation 2.42 clearly provides a global average turbulence viscosity in the entire 
fl ow domain.
Mixing length models are a separate class of algebraic models. These rely on 
empirical inputs and provide a spatially dependent turbulence viscosity. For example, 
according to Prandtl’s mixing length model, turbulence viscosity in a 2-D boundary 
layer fl ow is expressed as

in which l is the mixing length and is generally expressed as l = kδδ, δ being the local 
layer width and kδ an empirical constant. Rarely such equations or expressions are 
available and applied to the modeling of practical turbulent fl ows.
2.3.5.2 One Equation Turbulence Model
These are generally based on a relationship among eddy viscosity, µt, turbulence 
kinetic energy, k, and length scale, l, of the turbulence fl ow. One equation models 
embody a differential equation for the estimation of the characteristic velocity scale 
of turbulence, taken to be equivalent to k. Prandtl’s mixing length hypothesis in the 
context of one equation models is represented as

In Equation 2.46, v˜  x, v˜  y, and v˜  z are respectively the RMS of the fl uctuating velocity 
components of the fl ow in three different directions. The distribution of turbulence 
kinetic energy, k, in the domain is obtained by solving a partial differential equation 
(see later) describing the conservation of turbulence kinetic energy,* while the length 
scale is prescribed via an empirical expressions similar to the one presented above. 
Due to empiricism, this class of model lacks generality and is not suitable for model-
ing of steelmaking operations.
2.3.5.3 Two Equation Turbulence Model
The length scale, l, is problem specifi c, dependents on geometry, fl ow intensity, etc. 
and therefore is generally not known as a priori. Prescription of length scale via 
empirical, often ad-hoc relationships seriously impairs performance of one equation 
and mixing length models. Two equation models have therefore been advocated in 
which an additional conservation equation is solved to calculate the distribution of 
length scale (or some derivative of it) of the turbulent fl ow. Several versions exist 
and these include k–kl, k–ε, k–ω models, etc. Of these, the k–ε turbulence model 
has been widely used in steelmaking. The k–ε turbulence model [15] embodies two 
transport-type equations, each expressing the conservation of turbulence kinetic 
* Conservation equation for turbulence kinetic energy is formulated from a basic equation governing the 
conservation of internal energy. Numerous idealizations and assumptions are applied and therefore, 
the resultant equation is not exact. The governing equation embodies convection, diffusion, generation, 
and dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy and hence resembles a transport-type equation.

The k–ε turbulence model together with a set of empirical constants (collectively 
referred to as the standard coeffi cient k–ε turbulence model) work satisfactorily for a 
variety of high Reynolds number fl ows and enjoy widespread popularity among CFD 
practitioners. It is evident that turbulence model equations are mutually coupled with 
the RANS equations (e.g., Worked Example 2.3). Therefore, velocity and turbulence 
fi elds have to be always computed simultaneously.
The intensity of fl ow, size of eddies, nature of fl ow, etc. generally vary from 
one location to another within a fl ow domain. Remarkable contrast exists between 
a near-wall fl ow and those in the main bulk of liquid. For example, fl ows in the 
immediate vicinity of solid walls are relatively weak (i.e., Reynolds number of the 
fl ow is small) and as a consequence, viscous effects there are far more important 
than in the bulk of the liquid. Furthermore, steep gradients prevail in the laminar 
sublayer. As such, to resolve the fl ow accurately within the sublayer many grid 
points are needed and this tends to make fl ow calculation lengthy and tedious. As 
a consequence of such, the RANS and turbulence model equations are not inte-
grated through the laminar sublayer. Specifi c procedures such as wall functions, 
low Reynolds number turbulence model, etc. are applied to calculate the near-wall 
fl ows accurately [15].
Wall functions are essentially empirical equations used to represent profi les 
of velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, temperature, etc. in the near-wall region. 
Originally proposed by Nikarudse [16], the logarithmic laws of the wall have 
undergone many refi nements to become suffi ciently universal. The universal loga-
rithmic velocity profi le is imposed within the sublayer to connect the wall con-
ditions to the dependent variable immediately outside the sublayer. It is through 
such a profi le, the fl uid in the vicinity of solid walls is made to experience correct 
boundary condition (i.e., wall shear stress, wall heat fl ux, wall temperature, etc.) 
leading to suffi ciently accurate estimates of velocity, temperature, etc. in the near-
wall region.
The universal law of the wall is expressed as

These help adapt a turbulence model to the near-wall region with some sense of rig-
orousness. Different versions of Equations 2.51, 2.53, and 2.54 are available depend-
ing on the y+ criteria. The phenomenological description of Reynolds stresses or the 
 universal velocity profi le is useful only for the estimation of the time-averaged veloc-
ity profi les. These are as such not meant to provide useful insight into the phenomena 
of fl uid turbulence.
Physical boundaries such as walls, axis, free surface, inlet, and outlets are com-
mon in steelmaking. There, types of boundary conditions on k and ε are very similar 
to those on fl ow components, mentioned earlier. Thus, at the free surface as well as 
the axis, gradients of k and ε are set to zero. In addition to these, at the inlet, incom-
ing turbulence kinetic energy and corresponding dissipation rates are generally pre-
scribed in terms of inlet velocity, intensity of turbulence, hydraulic radius, etc. while 
at the outlet, outfl ow condition (normal gradient zero) is routinely prescribed. These 
are addressed in Section 5.3.

In Equation 2.56 the dissipation rate tensor, εij, the pressure rate of strain tensor, πij, 
and the turbulent transport terms, Cijk, are unknown. These are modeled to represent 
the stress transport equation in a closed form. For example, while the dissipation 
rate tensor is modeled by solving an additional equation governing the conservation 
of ε, the pressure–strain redistribution term is modeled by solving Poisson equation 
for pressure fl uctuation. Many equations and different variations of stress transport 
models result depending on the closure approximation [11]. Too many conservation 
equations make turbulent fl ow calculations time intensive. A second-order closure is 
obtained via the modeled version of the stress transport equation (i.e., Equation 2.56) 
and is generally employed.
2.3.5.5 Large Eddy Simulation
Large eddies in turbulent fl ows are dependent on the fl ow geometry, while smaller 
eddies are self-similar and have a universal character. Large eddies carry most of 
the Reynolds stress while the small-scale turbulence is weaker, contributing less to 
Reynolds stresses and is therefore less critical. Thus, in an LES, larger 3-D unsteady 
turbulent motions (or the large-scale motions) are computed, while the smaller, uni-
versal scale (the so-called subgrid scale [SGS]) motions are modeled using a SGS 
turbulence model. In practical fl ow simulation, one is required to solve the fi ltered 
Navier–Stokes equations with additional SGS stress terms. The most commonly used 
SGS models are the Smagorinsky model and its dynamic variants. They compensate 
for the unresolved turbulent scales through the addition of an “eddy viscosity” into 
the governing equations. In the absence of a SGS model, the LES approach is in 
principle equivalent to the DNS approach.
LES requires less computational effort than a DNS but more effort than those 
methods that solve the RANS equations. The computational demands also increase 
signifi cantly in the vicinity of walls, and simulating such fl ows accurately usually 
exceeds the limits of modern supercomputers. For this reason, zonal approaches are 
often adopted, with RANS or other empirically based models replacing the LES in

the near-wall region. The main advantage of the LES over computationally cheaper 
RANS approaches is the increased level of detail it can capture and deliver. While 
RANS methods provide “averaged” results, an LES is able to predict instantaneous 
fl ow characteristics and thereby resolve turbulent fl ow structures. Flow situations 
wherein transient effects are particularly important (viz., Section 5.3.1.3) and the 
DNS is not practical, the LES is perhaps the most effective alternative. Salient fea-
tures of the LES include
 
1. Filtering: A fi ltering operation (essentially space averaging) is defi ned to 
decompose the instantaneous velocity into the sum of a fi ltered (or resolved) 
component and a residual (or SGS) component. The fi ltered velocity fi eld, 
which is 3-D and time dependent, represents the motion of the large eddies. 
The fi ltered equations derived from the instantaneous Navier–Stokes equa-
tions are of a standard form but contain the residual stress tensor arising out 
of the unresolved motion.
 
2. Closure: Closure is obtained by modeling the residual stress tensor, most 
simply by an eddy viscosity model.
 
3. Solution: The modeled fi ltered equation is solved to obtain an approxima-
tion to a large-scale motion.*
In an LES, a fl ow variable ϕ in a fl ow domain is decomposed into a large-scale part 
and a small-scale part according to

ferent types of fi lter functions namely, Fourier cutoff fi lter, Gaussian fi lter, and the 
top hat fi lter are commonly used. For incompressible fl ow of a Newtonian fl uid,

These equations govern the large, energy carrying scales of motion. In Equation

. In many 
situations the equilibrium assumption is invoked (i.e., the small scales are in equilib-

This is known as the “Smagorinsky model.” In Equation 2.65, ∆ is the grid size 
(equivalent to the cube root of cell volume) and CS is the “Smagorinsky coeffi cient” 
that is dependent on the demarcation between the resolvable and the SGSs. A variety 
of SGS models exist.
Modeling of near-wall fl ows is a challenging issue in an LES since the presence 
of a solid boundary affects the physics of the SGS in several ways. Resolving the 
near-wall fl ow is more expensive and therefore, modeling is generally resorted to. 
Wall models, two layer models, RANS like model, etc. have all been applied to 
handle near-wall fl ows in the LES. Different SGS models and specifi c type of near-
wall treatment bring in variations to the LES approach. More elaborate discussion of 
these is available in [17].
2.4 HEAT TRANSFER
Heating, melting, solidifi cation, cooling, etc. are characteristics of steelmaking and 
involve thermal interactions among phases in which heat energy passes from one 
phase to another and a redistribution takes place. While the fi nal equilibrium state

following such interactions can be predicted well from the laws of thermodynamics, 
one is frequently concerned with the rate of heat transfer as this directly infl uences 
the process kinetics. For example, during alloying of steel or deoxidizer addition, sol-
ids initially at room temperature are projected into liquid steel at ∼1873 K, wherein 
these are progressively heated up to melt and dissolve. The rate of melting and the 
associated complete melting time are the consequences of the rate at which thermal 
energy is transferred from the bath to the solid body. Similarly, interactions between 
steel scrap and melt in a BOF, refractory and melt in furnaces and ladles, melt and the 
ambient during transfer operations, and so on involve heat transfer. In such context, 
rate calculation necessitates a sound understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
and the laws governing heat transfer.
2.4.1 MECHANISM OF HEAT TRANSFER
There are three fundamental modes of heat transfer, namely, conduction, convection, 
and radiation and these play important role in steelmaking. Their relative predomi-
nance, however, vary from one process to another. For example, radiative heat trans-
fer plays a dominant role and determines loss of heat from steelmaking furnaces to 
the surroundings. On the other hand, fl ow of heat within a solid ingot or a slab is 
solely due to conduction. In contrast, turbulent convective heat transfer is the pri-
mary mechanism for thermal energy redistribution in the melt contained in a ladle, 
tundish, etc. A brief discussion of these is presented in the following. More elaborate 
description is available in [18–20].
2.4.1.1 Conduction
Heat conduction is essentially transmission of energy by molecular motion. When 
one part of a body is at a higher temperature than the other, an energy transfer takes 
place from the high-temperature region and the energy is said to be transferred 
by conduction. Generally, a liquid is a better conductor than a gas and a solid is a 
better conductor than a liquid. Conduction therefore dominates transport of heat 
within a solid object. In steelmaking the importance of conduction is signifi cant. 
For example, during melting of scrap or alloying additions, heat is continuously 
transported within the body of the solid object by conduction, raising its temper-
ature and thereby aiding melting. Other relevant and technologically signifi cant 
examples include heat fl ow through refractory lining and steel shell of furnaces, 
heating and thermal homogenization of steel ingots/slabs in reheat furnaces and 
so on.
The rate equation for conduction is given by the Fourier’s law. For heat conduc-
tion in the x-direction, normal to an area “A,” the rate of heat fl ow, qc,x for isotropic 
and homogeneous material is

2.4.1.2 Convective Heat Transfer
Heat transfer associated with the movement of a fl uid is termed as convective heat 
transfer. If the fl uid motion is induced by some external means (say, through oxygen 
blowing as in BOFs), the phenomenon is called forced convection. On the other 
hand, if the fl uid motion arises from density gradients (i.e., due to a differential 
 temperature fi eld) induced by the transport process itself, the resultant phenom-
enon is called free convection. When both free and forced convection effects are 
signifi cant and neither can be neglected, the process is called mixed convection. 
In a steelmaking tundish, for example, free and forced convective heat transfer 
both play important roles while in BOFs, ladles, etc. forced convective heat transfer 
dominates.
The governing equation for temperature distribution in a fl owing system is derived 
from a procedure that is analogous to that of Equation 2.68. In this, the differential 
energy balance is performed over an infi nitesimal control volume (viz., similar to the 
one in Figure 2.10) considering thermal energy transport due to both conduction and 
convection. The resultant energy balance for a simplifi ed fl ow situation (i.e., laminar 
fl ow, negligible viscous dissipation, constant density, etc.), is represented in terms of 
the Cartesian coordinate system as

fore, one generally works out temperature distribution from a time-averaged version 
of Equation 2.69. The time-averaged form of Equation 2.69 is derived according to 
the approach described in Section 2.3.4 and represented for constant thermophysical

in which Keff is the effective thermal conductivity, a sum of molecular (K) and tur-
bulent thermal conductivity (Kt).* Thus, given the fl ow and the turbulence parameter 
distribution, the temperature within a moving fl uid, T(x, y, z, and t) is estimated on 
the basis of Equation 2.72. This involves solution of a number of simultaneous, non-
linear, coupled, p.d.e’s. Heat transfer in practice is generally 3-D and transient (i.e., 
temperature rarely remains constant during processing and transfer operations).
Boundary conditions to Equations 2.68 and 2.72 are provided in terms of either 
temperature or heat fl ux. Heat fl ux is provided directly if these are known or alterna-
tively, in terms of a heat transfer coeffi cient and an ambient temperature. Heat fl ux 
and temperature prevalent at refractory walls, free surface, etc. are often not known. 
This makes thermal calculations in steel processing units diffi cult and uncertain.
In many situations, we are concerned with the estimation of the rate of heat trans-
fer between a fl uid and a solid surface in contact with each other. The rate of heat 
transfer under such a condition can be predicted in principle by solving Equation 
2.72 and evaluating the associated temperature gradient at the surface of the solid. 
However, in many problems of practical interest, this is often not practised and 
instead an alternative approach is adopted. The rate equation used in convective 
heat transfer where thermal energy is transported from the liquid to the solid is 
expressed via

The heat transfer coeffi cient, hc, depends on space, time, geometry, orientation of 
the solid surface relative to the fl ow, fl ow intensity (i.e., magnitude) and conditions 
(i.e., laminar or turbulent) as well as fl uid properties. Empirical correlations (i.e., 
Nu = f(Re, Pr) in forced convective heat transfer and Nu = f(Gr, Pr) in free con-
vective heat transfer) specifi c to fl ow confi gurations are available and adapted to 
estimate heat transfer coeffi cient, hc, based on which rate of transport is estimated 
via Equation 2.73.
2.4.1.3 Radiation
Radiation is a mode of heat transfer which is distinctly different from conduction and 
convection. Whereas a material medium is a must for conduction and convection, 
heat is also transferred through perfect vacuum. The mechanism in this case is elec-
tromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light. The propagation of electromag-
netic waves as a result of temperature difference between heat exchanging bodies is 
called thermal radiation or simply radiation.
Thermodynamic considerations show that an ideal thermal radiator, or black 
body,* emits energy in vacuum or in gases at a rate proportional to the fourth power 
of the absolute temperature of the body, θ, and its surface area, A. Thus the rate equa-
tion in radiative heat transfer takes the following form:
 
4

R

A
σ

(2.74)
Equation 2.74 is popularly known as the Stefan–Boltzman’s law of thermal  radiation 
in which σR is the “Stefan–Boltzman constant” and has a value of 5.669 × 10−8 
W/m2 K4. To take into account the nonblack nature of actual surfaces, “emissivity,” 
εs, which relates radiation from a nonblack surface to that of an ideal black surface, 
is introduced in Equation 2.74. Consequently, the net rate of radiative heat exchange 
from a hot surface (θs) to say, cool air (θ∞) is given by

σR is the Stefan–Boltzman constant
A is the surface area through which heat fl ows
θs is the absolute surface temperature
θ∞ is the absolute ambient temperature
It is evident that importance of radiation becomes pronounced at high temperature 
as heat transfer rates vary according to the fourth power of absolute temperature. 
Radiation plays important roles in steel melting units, reheat furnaces, thermo-
mechanical treatments, and so on. Heat loss from furnaces, ladles, etc. are also 
predominantly due to radiation.
* A black body is defi ned as one which absorbs all the incident radiation.

2.5 MASS TRANSFER
Predicting feasibility of chemical reactions on the basis of thermodynamics is gen-
erally not enough as engineering is often concerned with the calculation of the

associated rates. Chemical reactions in steelmaking are essentially heterogeneous 
in nature and therefore, the associated kinetics depends on both chemical reaction 
as well as mass transport. Consider, for example, deoxidation of steel. This involves 
melting of deoxidizer elements, their subsequent dissolution and dispersion within 
the melt and fi nally, a chemical reaction with dissolved oxygen. The overall kinet-
ics of deoxidation is governed by the kinetics of individual processes involving heat 
transfer (i.e., deoxidizer melting), mass transfer (i.e., dissolution and dispersion), as 
well as the chemical reaction between dissolved oxygen and the deoxidizer (i.e., 
m[X] + n[O]→(XmOn)). At steelmaking temperatures, the chemical reaction rates 
are often appreciable.* Similarly, the kinetics of heat transfer is generally orders 
of magnitude higher than that of mass transfer. Consequently, the overall rate of 
deoxidation process is expected to be largely determined by the rate of mass transfer 
processes (viz., dissolution and dispersion).† Indeed, barring few exceptions (e.g., 
dissolution of nitrogen in steel melt containing oxygen and sulfur), the rates of vari-
ous chemical processes in steelmaking are primarily mass transfer controlled. In 
such context, the activation energy, effect of stirring, or a catalyst on the reaction 
rates often provides useful insight into the nature of the rate-limiting step. While 
chemical kinetics is described in more detail in Section 2.6, a brief summary of mass 
transfer is presented in the following.
2.5.1 MECHANISMS OF MASS TRANSFER
Mass transfer primarily occurs by molecular diffusion and bulk convection. From 
a mechanistic viewpoint, diffusive and convective transport of mass and heat are 
analogous. Therefore, discussion presented in Sections 2.4.1.1 and 2.4.1.2 remains 
largely applicable to the present context.
2.5.1.1 Molecular Diffusion
Molecular diffusion is analogous to heat conduction and is governed by a gradient-
type law. The phenomenological law of diffusion is the Fick’s fi rst law based on which 
rate (kg mol/s or, kg/s) of diffusive transport is estimated. This is expressed as

(2.76)
in which
Ni,x is the rate of mass fl ow of species “i” in the x-direction due to diffusion
Di is the diffusion coeffi cient of species “i”
A is the area normal to the x-direction through which material fl ows
Ci is mass or molar concentration of species “i”
x is the length variable
* This is so as the rate of a chemical reaction increases exponentially with temperature (see later).
† When individual kinetic steps/processes work in series, it is the slowest step that infl uences the overall 
rate most. The scenario is exactly reversed for kinetic steps working in parallel. It is diffi cult to con-
ceptualize a process in which all kinetic steps act exclusively parallel.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Molecular diffusion is a very slow process and is the only mode of transport in 
motionless systems. It plays important roles in thermal and material homogeniza-
tion in solids, during surface coating as well as other surface treatments. In liquid 
steel processing, convection and turbulent diffusion are the dominant modes of mass 
transport.
Analogous to Equation 2.68, the governing equation of diffusive mass transport 
is derived on the basis of a differential mass balance over an infi nitesimal volume 
element and is represented as

2.5.1.2 Convective Mass Transfer
Mass transfer occurs as a result of both convection (e.g., laminar or turbulent) and 
diffusion processes. In the main bulk of liquid, while convective components of 
mass fl ow dominate, within boundary layers, where fl ow is generally weak, the dif-
fusive transport assumes importance. In order to estimate convective mass transfer 
rates, knowledge of fl uid fl ow is a prerequisite.
The total fl ux of a species “i” across a fi xed plane normal to the x-direction is 
composed of three individual fl uxes, as expressed via the following expression:

Equation 2.81 is the rate expression for mass transfer across a concentration 
boundary layer and is applied to estimate mass transfer to and from a solid in a 
moving liquid (e.g., dissolution of solids such as V, W, Mo, Nb, etc. in steel, trans-
fer of carbon from hot metal to scrap, etc.). The driving force for mass transfer, 
(Cis − Ci∞) in actual practice is deduced from the underlying process kinetics. 
Since the rate of chemical reaction in high-temperature steelmaking is generally 
fast, the concentration at the surface can be conveniently fi xed at the equilibrium 
or saturation concentration of the species in liquid. Similarly, convection and eddy 
diffusion processes make mass transfer in the bulk of liquid relatively fast and 
this tends to eliminate any concentration inhomogeneties. Given that, the far fi eld 
concentration can be assumed to prevail right up to the edge of the concentration

boundary layer. With such considerations, knowledge of mass transfer coeffi cient 
alone is required to estimate mass transfer rates via Equation 2.81. Mass transfer 
coeffi cient, like its heat transfer counterpart, depends on space, time, geometry 
as well as characteristics and properties of the fl ow and is estimated from empiri-
cal mass transfer correlations. For example, forced convective mass transfer coef-
fi cient is deduced from a correlation among Sherwood, Reynolds, and Schmidt 
numbers.
In molten steel processing operations, turbulent convection is the predominant 
mode of mass transport in the main bulk of liquid, and therefore, as Equation 2.78 
indicates, knowledge of velocity, eddy diffusivity, and concentration is required 
for estimation of the net rate of transfer. Given the velocity and turbulence fi elds, 
the concentration of a species, Ci, in a turbulent fl ow is predicted from an equation 
having a form similar to Equation 2.72. For example, the time-averaged equation 
describing the conservation of a species “i” is represented in terms of the Cartesian 
coordinate system as

empirically determined.
Mass transfer between two immiscible liquid phases such as slag and metal is 
common in steelmaking. There, species or mass transfer occurs from a region of 
higher chemical potential to a lower one. Consider a situation in which transport of 
a solute occurs from bulk to interface in phase I, followed by an interfacial chem-
ical reaction and fi nally, transport from the interface to bulk in phase II.* Given 
the chemical reaction at the interface is suffi ciently fast such that local equilibrium 
prevails (i.e.,

one of the two phases is rate limiting, is readily derived from Equation 2.83. A simi-
lar expression for mixed control is presented in the following section.
It is diffi cult to estimate mass transfer rates between two fl uids purely theoretically 
on the basis of Equations 2.83 and 2.84. This is so as the interface between two fl uids 
is not stagnant (as it is in mass transfer between a solid and a liquid) and is moving. 
Although the process of mass transfer to a moving fl uid is complex (i.e., interfa-
cial area, A, is uncertain), simple models (e.g., fi lm, penetration models, etc.) exist 
and these provide reasonable description under certain simple situations. Otherwise, 
estimation of mass transfer rates between two fl uids is largely empirical.
Refi ning reactions in steelmaking, in addition to mass transfer, involves chemical 
reactions between species present in different phases. Therefore, either mass transfer 
or chemical reaction could be rate limiting. In terms of the slowest step, the over-
all process rate is generally characterized as (1) metal phase control, (2) chemical

reactions control, or (3) slag phase control. In contrast, if more than one kinetic steps 
infl uence the rate, it is considered to be mixed control. While these are addressed 
in the immediately following section, such possibilities are shown schematically in 
Figure 2.13 in which time-averaged concentration profi les within two interacting 
fl uids are depicted. More details are available in [22–24].

= 1.0 × 10−6 m2/s, solubility of tungsten in steel = 4130 kg/m3, and density of 
tungsten = 13,120 kg/m3. The applicable convective mass transfer correlation is 
Shd = 0.73(Red)0.57 (Sc)0.33.
Dissolution of tungsten in molten steel involves the following kinetic steps:
 
1. Chemical reaction at the solid–liquid interface, W(s) → W
 
2. Transport of dissolved tungsten, W, from the interface to the bulk of liquid 
steel
Step 2 is further subdivided into two separate kinetic steps, operating in series, 
involving
 2a. Transport of W from the solid–liquid interface to the edge of the concentra-
tion boundary layer
 2b. Transport of W from the edge of the boundary layer to the bulk of liquid 
steel
Consequently, in a rigorous sense, the overall rate of dissolution is a function of the 
intrinsic rates of the three individual kinetic steps, i.e., 1, 2a, and 2b, respectively.
At elevated temperature, the rate of chemical reaction is generally fast. Furthermore 
the melt is well stirred. Consequently, intrinsic rate of steps 1 and 2b are expected 
to be relatively faster than the rate of step 2a. Given that, the rate of dissolution is 
practically equivalent to the rate of mass transport across the concentration bound-
ary layer, i.e., the slowest kinetic step.

2.6 CHEMICAL KINETICS
In steelmaking, as pointed out earlier, the effi ciency and productivity of a process is 
frequently determined by fl uid fl ow, mass transport, and the rates of chemical reac-
tions. Having discussed fl uid low, heat, and mass transport, an overview of the topic 
of chemical reaction kinetics is presented in this section.
2.6.1 HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS
Homogeneous reactions are ones that entail only one phase; an example is the neu-
tralization of an acid by a base in an aqueous solution, the one phase in that case 
being the liquid solution. Homogeneous reactions are more common in laboratories 
and chemical plants than they are in metallurgical processes and we will give them 
only the briefest coverage here. Heterogeneous reactions are ones that entail two or 
more phases. An example is the oxidation of a hot piece of solid carbon by oxygen in 
the air such as occurs when coke is removed from coke ovens.
The quantitative treatment of homogeneous reaction kinetics is given in elemen-
tary chemistry courses and usually starts with the defi nition of a reaction rate, ℜ, 
as the number of moles of some species reacting per second per unit volume of the 
reacting phase. For example, for the neutralization discussed above an appropriate 
defi nition of rate would be moles of hydrogen ion neutralized per liter of the solution 
per second. The dependence of such reaction rates on solution composition and tem-
perature has been the subject of study by chemists for over a century and the results 
expressed in rate equations. The mathematics is particularly simple if the volume of 
the reacting phase is constant and there are neither infl ows nor outfl ows. Consider 
the homogeneous reaction of some species A with a second species B. The rate of 
reaction is given by

(2.85)
in which
CA and CB are the concentration of species A and B
t is the time
kr,A–B is the reaction rate constant
nA and nB are the reaction order with respect to A and B
Reaction orders and the rate constants have until recently been determined by chem-
ists by fi tting presumed rate equations to experimental measurements of reaction 
rates. Recently, at least for homogeneous reactions, the prediction of reaction rates 
from molecular simulations has become possible. Needless to say, homogeneous 
reactions are rarely encountered by metallurgical engineers.
  

Knowledge-Based Foundation of Steelmaking 
77
Heterogeneous reactions occur at the interface between phases. For example, the 
 oxidation of carbon in the air mentioned above takes place at the interface between 
the carbon phase and the gas phase for the reason that this is the only place where 
both the reactants are simultaneously present.* Consequently, the reaction rate is 
imperfectly defi ned if we express it in moles per second per unit volume (although 
this is sometimes done). Rather the rate should be defi ned in terms of moles per sec-
ond per unit area of reaction interface. For example, in the carbon oxidation case it 
would be moles of carbon consumed per second per square meter of carbon surface. 
Some complications are immediately apparent. For example the area of the carbon 
surface is constantly changing with time. Consequently, simple equations such as 
Equation 2.85 can rarely be used although we can still expect the rate to depend on 
the “concentration” of some of the species present at the surface where a reaction is 
taking place. The concentration of a solid at a surface is ill defi ned and a better mea-
sure of the presence of a solid at the reaction site is its activity. Indeed for all reac-
tants it is more fundamental to use activities, rather than concentration in developing 
rate equations, as activities (or their close relations, the chemical potentials) are the 
thermodynamic “driving force” for reactions. So for the carbon oxidation reaction, 
the activity of the carbon is one (assuming pure carbon) and the oxygen activity is 
equal to its partial pressure. If ideal gas behavior is assumed, the partial pressure of 
oxygen is equivalent to its concentration and therefore we get
 
r
O2
n
k C
ℜ=
 
(2.86)
The rate equation contains the concentration of oxygen and this is the oxygen 
 concentration adjacent to the carbon surface; again n is the reaction order (the sub-
script has been dropped because it is obvious that it is for oxygen). If n = 1, for exam-
ple, the reaction is said to be “fi rst order.” Note that there is nothing in the equation 
corresponding to the “concentration” of carbon. The amount of carbon still “matters” 
since ℜ is defi ned per unit area of carbon surface. Consequently, if we double the 
amount of carbon in our reactor, the moles of carbon oxidized produced per second 
is expected to increase.
Equation 2.86 shows a simple “power law” relationship between the concentra-
tion of the oxygen and the rate of the heterogeneous reaction. Sometimes the reaction 
kinetics is more complicated. An example is the reduction of nickel oxide by hydro-
gen at elevated temperature:
 
2
2
NiO(s) + H  (g) = Ni(s) + H O (gas) 
This is best described by the rate equation:

(2.87)
* If the carbon were porous, such as the coke mentioned above, reaction would take place “inside” the 
coke, as well as on its surface. Nevertheless, reaction still takes place at an interface between solid 
carbon and gas. The interface inside the coke is made up of the pore walls.
  

78 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
in which kr,1 and kr,2 are rate constants. This form of a rate equation is termed 
Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics after the two chemists who studied the gas 
 adsorption/desorption that lie at the heart of the reaction. It is apparent from Equation 
2.87 that rate is fi rst order for low CH2 and “zeroth order” for higher CH2. Again the 
amount of nickel oxide does not appear in the rate equation.
A further complication arises when the reaction is reversible (i.e., the equilibrium 
constant for the reaction is not large). This slows the reaction even when the reaction 
is only partly completed. Mathematically this is accounted for by expressing the rate 
as the difference between two terms: a “forward” term such as that in Equation 2.86 
and a “backward” term of similar form but entailing the product(s) of reaction. In the 
following discussion, only irreversible reactions are considered.
2.6.2 EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE
The concentration of the reacting species (or at least some of them) affects the reac-
tion rate. Another important factor affecting the rate is the temperature. The rate 
“constant” for a reaction generally depends on absolute temperature according to the 
Arrhenius equation:

(2.88)
in which
EA is the activation energy
Rg is the gas constant
T is the temperature
Ao is the pre-exponential constant
Ao and EA are supposed to be independent of temperature but differ from reaction to 
reaction. Equation 2.88 on a logarithmic scale leads to the well-known Arrhenius plot 
where the logarithm of the rate constant plotted against the reciprocal of the absolute 
temperature yields a straight line with a negative slope. As illustrated in Figure 2.14, 
the slope of the line is a direct measure of the activation energy of the reaction. From 
a practical viewpoint, Equation 2.88 suggests that reaction rates increase rapidly with 
temperature (in temperature regimes which we can achieve in most reactors). This 
is shown in Figure 2.15. Such a behavior further implies that the productivity of a 
reactor, and therefore its profi tability, should be increased almost without limit by 
increasing temperature. There are however limitations to such an increase.
2.6.3  HETEROGENEOUS CHEMICAL REACTION COUPLED WITH MASS TRANSFER
Consider the spherical* particle of solid, B, shown in Figure 2.16 undergoing a reac-
tion with a constituent, A, in the gas phase to produce a gaseous product (e.g., oxida-
tion of carbon by oxygen in air to produce carbon monoxide),

In this, CA∞ is the concentration of A at a distance far from the surface of B, more 
precisely outside the mass transfer boundary layer. The concentration of A within 
the boundary layer drops from CA∞ to a value CAs in the gas phase immediately 
adjacent to the solid. It is this last concentration that matters in the chemical rate 
equation because it is this concentration, CAs, rather than the bulk concentration that 
the solid “sees.”
Only tiny amounts of a gas species can be accumulated at a surface, i.e., amounts 
that are negligible compared to the amounts involved in reacting away the solid. 
Consequently, the fl ux of A to the surface is equated with the rate of reaction there, i.e.,

The great utility of Equation 2.92 is twofold. Firstly, the rate is expressed in terms 
of CA∞, rather than CAs. The latter would be diffi cult, perhaps impossible, to measure 
experimentally. Numerous laboratory techniques (e.g., gas chromatography of a bulk 
sample) are available to measure the former concentration. The second utility has to 
do with the right of the equation since
 
Driving force for reaction
Rate of reaction
Sum of the resistances to reaction
=
 
(2.93)
The driving force for the reaction is the concentration of A in the bulk of the gas 
and the sum of resistances to the reaction is the sum of individual resistances 
being equal to the sum of the reciprocal of the rate constant and the mass transfer 
coeffi cient. The last equation is analogous to Ohm’s law applied to a voltage dif-
ference (driving force) between two resistors in series to yield a current (rate of 
fl ow of charge).
Equations 2.91 and 2.92 lead to an important concept in heterogeneous reaction 
kinetics. First consider one extreme km >> kr. Consequently

 and there-
fore, the resistance to mass transfer is much smaller than the resistance to chemical 
step such that the latter is ignored in Equation 2.92. The sum of the resistance is 
therefore equal to the chemical step resistance, and hence the following result is 
obtained from Equation 2.92:
 
r

(2.94)
Under such circumstances the mass transfer step has no infl uence on the rate of 
reaction and the progress of reaction is solely determined by the chemical rate coef-
fi cient. The reaction is said to be “chemical step controlled” (sometimes “kinetically 
or chemically controlled” is used) or that the “chemical step (kinetics) is rate control-
ling.” For the other extreme, kr >> km the rate is given by
 
m
A
k C ∞
ℜ=
 
(2.95)
The reaction is said to be “controlled by mass transfer” or simply mass transfer con-
trolled due to the resistance of the mass transfer step being much larger than that of 
the chemical step.*
* The electrical analogy mentioned above is applicable to the notion of a rate-controlling step. Consider 
the current through two adjustable resistors in series, with one resistor capable of adjustment from 
1 to 5 kΩ and the other from 1 to 5O Ω. What is the effect on current of changing the second resistor? 
Which resistor could we say is determining the rate (of fl ow of charge)?
  

82 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Between the two extremes when km and kr are comparable, the reaction is said to 
be mixed control and the full form of Equation 2.92 must be used. The relative mag-
nitude of the mass transfer coeffi cient and chemical rate constant determines what 
rate is controlling.* The former can be increased by increasing the relative velocity 
between the gas and the solid and the latter by reducing the size of the solid particle. 
More important however is the effect of temperature.
Equation 2.88 describes the effect of temperature on the rate constant and there-
fore on the reaction rate provided concentrations are held constant. The effect of 
temperature on mass transfer coeffi cients is approximately
 
( )

(2.96)
in which
θ is the temperature in absolute scale
m is approximately 1.5
Consequently, as we increase the temperature, the chemical rate constant and the 
mass transfer coeffi cient both increase as sketched in Figure 2.17.† Notable is the 
much more rapid increase, with temperature, of the chemical rate constant than the 
mass transfer coeffi cient. In other words, we expect chemical step control at lower 
temperatures and mass transfer control at higher temperatures. The middle part of 
Equation 2.92 shows that the factor

 determines the reaction rate, 
given CA∞. The factor is also plotted in Figure 2.17 and we see that at low tempera-
tures it approaches kr, while at high temperatures it approaches km. This implies that 
* Rigorously, the rate-controlling step is the one with the smallest rate coeffi cient (km or kr).
† Of course the relative positions of the curves for km and kr will shift around as km is changed by, for 
example, changing the gas velocity.

an Arrhenius plot of the rate of reaction yields a straight line up to the temperature 
where mass transport starts to have an effect on the progress of reaction.
As the reaction proceeds, the solid particle diminishes in size. Equation 2.94 
indicates that the rate of reaction remains unchanged as long as CA∞ is constant. We 
therefore conclude that the rate constant does not depend on particle size. Given that 
and a constant density, the rate of shrinking (m/s) is also constant, i.e.,

 Based on this and Equation 2.97, a relationship 
is obtained that plots like the one sketched in Figure 2.18. This is true for chemically 
controlled reactions. If mass transfer is rate controlling or we have mixed control, the 
rate of reaction changes somewhat as the particle shrinks because the mass transfer 
coeffi cient depends on particle size. Consequently, the plot of extent of reaction, Ft, 
versus time, t, differs slightly in shape from that in Figure 2.18.
There are many heterogeneous reactions which have both solid and gaseous prod-
ucts. The reduction of nickel oxide by hydrogen discussed earlier is such a reaction. 
If the solid reactant (e.g., the NiO) is nonporous, then the reaction usually proceeds 
as sketched in Figure 2.19. After some time there is a layer of solid reaction product 
(Ni in this case) surrounding a shrinking core of the solid reactant. Such types of 
reactions are therefore usually called “shrinking core reactions.” Typically the layer

of reaction product is porous and the gaseous reactant reaches the reaction interface 
by diffusing through these pores which also provide a path for the escape of the 
gaseous reaction product (water vapor in this example). Assuming an irreversible 
reaction, three steps are to be considered:
 
1. Mass transfer of the gaseous reactant external to the solid
 
2. Diffusion of the reactant through the pores of the solid product
 
3. Chemical reaction at the interface between the gaseous reactant and the core
For simple cases (e.g., fi rst-order reaction under isothermal conditions) the quantita-
tive treatment of shrinking core reactions is straightforward [24]. It is unlikely that 
step 1 is ever rate controlling. Step 3 tends to be rate controlling for low temperatures 
and small particles while step 2 is rate controlling for large particles (long diffu-
sion path lengths) or higher temperatures. The time to completely react a particle 
is proportional to the particle diameter for chemical step control but to the square 
of particle diameter for diffusion within the pores controlling. In both the cases the 
reduction time is reduced as the temperature is increased (diffusion within pores 
becoming more rapid with temperature) but the effect is more marked for chemical 
control.
At times the solid reactant is also porous (as well as the solid product). This is 
the case for the reaction of pellets of iron ore or sinter fed to the iron blast furnace. 
In such case, there is an opportunity for gaseous reactant molecules to diffuse deep 
into the pores of unreacted solid before they fi nally react. Reaction therefore takes 
place in a zone of the solid rather than at the sharp interface of the shrinking core 
reactions. It is to be noted that the reaction of such a porous particle is dependent on

the microstructure of the solid reactant, e.g., the porosity and pore size distribution. 
Mathematical models of such reactions have been devised based on idealized micro-
structure. One such example is the “grain model” which envisions the porous particle 
as made up of a large number of grains (e.g., spheres) each of which is undergoing a 
reaction according to the shrinking core morphology [24]. Such models, or a qualita-
tive understanding of the phenomena, suggest that at lower temperatures a reaction is 
controlled by the chemical step and the zone of the reaction extends throughout the 
porous particle while at higher temperatures diffusion within the pores is rate con-
trolling and the zone narrows to a sharp interface similar to that of shrinking core 
reactions. For porous reactants, the time for a complete reaction is independent of 
particle size in case of chemical step control but proportional to the square of particle 
size for control by diffusion within the pores.
There are other kinds of reactions of interest to the metallurgist besides gas–solid 
ones, such as liquid–solid reactions during leaching or dissolution. As a fi rst approxi-
mation, the kinetics of such reactions can be treated just as the kinetics of gas–solid 
reactions outlined above. A caution should however be added: leaching reactions are 
frequently electrochemical, rather than chemical in nature. Another important class 
of reactions is gas–liquid reactions and these are at the heart of steelmaking. Again 
mass transfer considerations are important. In fact, because of the large values for 
chemical rate constants at high temperatures, mass transport dominates at steelmak-
ing temperatures such that chemical reactions can usually be assumed to be at local 
equilibrium and mass transport rate controlling. Finally there are liquid–liquid reac-
tions to consider such as slag–metal reactions. Here mass transport at the interface 
is a possible rate-controlling step particularly in high-temperature steelmaking. The 
step could be on either side of the interface as we have pointed out in Section 2.5.1.2. 
In all such cases, productivity can frequently be increased by
 
1. Increasing temperature
 
2. Increasing the area between phases at which the reaction is taking place 
(e.g., reducing particle size in gas–solid reactions, dispersing one phase in 
the other in two fl uid reactions)
 
3. Enhancing mass transport (increasing relative velocities between phases, 
reducing diffusion path lengths)
2.7 BEHAVIOR OF GAS JETS IN LIQUIDS
Gas injection is routinely applied in steelmaking (e.g., in BOFs, ladles, torpedoes, 
tundishes, and so on) to enhance reaction rates, eliminate thermal and compositional 
gradients, to remove particulates, and so on. Both reacting (as oxygen in bottom 
blown converters) and inert gases (i.e., argon in steel processing ladles, continuous 
casting molds, etc.) are injected. A wide range of gas fl ow rates and speeds (subsonic 
as well as supersonic) is employed to deliver gas through different types of gas injec-
tion devices (plug/tuyere or a lance). Impinging gas jets are encountered in oxygen 
and arc furnace steelmaking while submerged gas injection is popular in ladles, 
tundishes, and molds. Fluid dynamics of submerged and impinging gas jet systems 
and their interactions with steel melts is briefl y reviewed in the following sections.
  

86 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
2.7.1 SUBMERGED GAS INJECTION
Submerged gas injection is widely practiced in steelmaking. For example, oxygen, 
argon, or nitrogen is routinely injected through tuyeres or porous plugs (a set of tiny 
orifi ces) in a BOF, electric arc furnace (EAF), ladle, tundish, and so on. The injected 
gas depending on the dimension of the tuyere/nozzle and the volumetric fl ow rates 
can lead to either a bubbling condition or a jetting condition. The critical condition 
between the two patterns is generally described by the Mach number.* Under the 
bubbling condition, Mach number is smaller than unity while under the jetting con-
dition, Mach number is greater than unity. Schematics of the two fl ow regimes are 
depicted in Figure 2.20.
At small gas fl ow rates and reasonable nozzle/orifi ce dimensions (i.e., small free 
space velocity), individual bubbles form at the tip of the nozzle or orifi ce. In aqueous 
systems, this happens till orifi ce Reynolds number is less than about 2100 or so. As the 
free space velocity is increased, the bubbles begin to elongate in the vertical direction. 
The elongation of the bubble leads to the formation of a continuous jet with increas-
ing gas velocity (i.e., proportional to inertial forces). The bubbling–jetting transition 
occurs over a narrow range of gas fl ow rate or free space gas velocity. The jet may form 
a continuous column of gas in the bath or break up into a swarm of bubbles and these 
depend on the fl ow rate, nozzle dimension, bath depth, and so on. Jetting is controlled 
mainly by the inertial forces of the injected gas. At the interface of gas and liquid, 
the shearing action of the vertically rising column of gas plays important roles as it 
* Mach number represents the ratio between local velocity and the velocity of sound in the same medium.

produces many small bubbles and causes the liquid to recirculate in the system. In 
the bubbling regime, both inertial and buoyancy forces are important. At extremely 
small fl ow rates, buoyancy outweighs inertial forces. The interaction between gas 
and liquid at such low fl ow rates is described more elaborately in Chapter 8.
At very low fl ow rates (Redn < 500) through an orifi ce immersed in a liquid, the 
bubble diameter on detachment is dictated by a balance between the surface tension 
and buoyancy forces and is expressed as

Many such expressions exist in the literature for different ranges of orifi ce Reynolds 
number. Empirical equations which are generally derived from aqueous systems are 
modifi ed for liquid metal systems. For example, Equation 2.98 assumes the follow-
ing form:

(2.99)
in which dn,out is the outer diameter of the nozzle or orifi ce. The difference between 
the two preceding relationships is essentially due to the nonwetting behavior in the 
refractory-liquid metal system as depicted in Figure 2.21 [25]. The fi nal volume on 
detachment is generally found to be larger than the one estimated from Equation 
2.99 due to the antechamber effect.*
The rising velocity of bubbles and their geometrical shape depends on the size of 
the bubbles, thermophysical properties of gas and liquid, and so on. Small bubbles 
(20 mm > db and Reb < 1) are invariably spherical shaped and rise, in the absence of 
any signifi cant interference, with their terminal rise velocity. As the bubble’s size 
and Reynolds number increase (20 mm < db < 50 mm and 1 < Reb < 400) bubbles tend 
to rise with higher than their Stokes rising velocity. With further increase in size and 
velocity, the bubble shape changes to spheroidal or ellipsoidal. Large bubbles rising 
through water and molten steel are invariably of spherical cap geometry.
Vertical submerged gas injection into liquids produces a gas–liquid two-phase 
zone that is subdivided into four different regions with respect to the axial distance 
measured from the tip of the orifi ce/nozzle. These are the momentum, transition, 
buoyancy and the surface regions shown schematically in Figure 2.22 [26]. In the 
momentum region a more or less continuous gas jet forms, which is largely governed 
by the inertial forces of the injected gas. The buoyancy forces play vital roles in the 
buoyancy region. The ratio of inertial to buoyancy forces, (

 is 
termed as the modifi ed Froude number, Frm. As Frm increases, the momentum region 
extends toward the bath surface.
* During the formation of the bubbles, there is a gradual built up of pressure behind the nozzle/orifi ce. 
This is signifi cant in molten metal system and result in a fi nal bubble volume on detachment that is 
somewhat larger than the one estimated on the basis of a static balance (viz., Equation 2.99).
  

88 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
The momentum region can be more pronounced in systems when the gas 
injection rate is relatively large and the bath depth is small. Under such conditions, 
swirling motion generally sets in and bubbles beyond the momentum region do not 
rise vertically upward. Swirling motion of jet or bubbles is predominant in bottom 
blown oxygen steelmaking converters which are operated at high oxygen fl ow rates 
and shallow bath depths. Swirling can also contribute to large-scale 3-D fl ows in

an otherwise axisymmetrical gas injection system expediting mixing considerably. 
Swirling motion of jets is also responsible for pronounced free-surface oscillations.
Single bubble rarely forms in practice, although expressions of bubble size, drag 
coeffi cient, etc. are often deduced on the basis of available “single bubble corre-
lations.” The characteristics of submerged gas injection in steelmaking have been 
investigated experimentally and expressions of jet penetration, bubble size, and fre-
quency, their rise velocity, etc. are reported in the literature over a wide variety of 
operating conditions. Many of these are summarized later in Chapter 8. Similarly, 
mathematical models based on the concept of “population balance” are applied 
(Chapter 6) to obtain a more clear picture and greater insight into the submerged gas 
injection phenomena.
2.7.2 IMPINGING GAS JET
In BOF and EAF steelmaking, oxygen gas at supersonic speed is injected to facili-
tate a high process rate. The jet impinging on the melt surface ejects metal droplets, 
recirculates the bath through shearing action exacerbating chemical reactions among 
slag, metal, and gas. A supersonic oxygen jet is delivered through an appropriately 
designed nozzle fi tted at the end of a tube that helps accelerate oxygen gas by con-
version of pressure into kinetic energy. The supersonic jet issuing from the nozzle 
has a supersonic core in which the gas velocity is higher than Ma 1. The diameter of 
the core gradually narrows down as shown in Figure 2.23. In oxygen steelmaking, 
the supersonic core is typically 3–8 times of the nozzle exit diameter. CoJet® is a

modern technology that aids to substantially enhance the supersonic core of the jet 
leading to superior process performance. Beyond its supersonic core, the jet begins to 
spread by entraining the ambient. The overall spreading of the jet is expressed either 
as the ratio of the gas velocity at radius r to the corresponding centerline velocity,

literature.
A schematic of a gas jet issuing from a single nozzle and impinging on the surface 
of a liquid is shown in Figure 2.24. There, the impact area and the penetration depth 
are important parameters and infl uence the extent of momentum transfer and hence 
liquid circulation rate. These are primarily a function of gas pressure, nozzle design 
and their number, fl ow rate, distance of the nozzle tip from the undisturbed bath sur-
face (i.e., commonly termed as the lance height), etc. Empirical expressions, specifi c

Fluid fl ow in BOFs and EAFs is highly complex. A fundamentally based multi-
phase reacting fl ow model capable of predicting the dynamics of such systems has 
not been possible till date. Numerous plant- and laboratory-scale investigations have 
been carried out [28] to gain useful insight into the gas–liquid interaction in steel-
making processes.
2.8 CONCLUDING REMARKS
A sound understanding of the science and technology of steelmaking is essential to 
process modeling. These are introduced, albeit very briefl y, in the fi rst two chap-
ters of this book. An overview of the scientifi c fundamentals outlining some key 
concepts in metallurgical thermodynamics, fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer, and 
chemical kinetics is presented in this chapter. As each of the topics covered is fairly 
vast, readers are frequently referred to additional resource material for more insight 
and elaborate descriptions. The chapter provides an opportunity to revisit quickly the 
science behind steelmaking.

3 Elements of Physical 
Modeling
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Production of steel from pig iron involves a series of unit operations in which chemical 
reactions, fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer, etc. all take part to a varied degree. To 
investigate these in situ, high operating temperatures, relatively the large size of steel-
making reactors, and visual opacity of molten steel pose considerable diffi culties. 
Modeling coupled with plant or pilot-scale trials therefore forms the basis of process 
analysis, new process development, and design and optimization in steelmaking.
Modeling is a well-accepted scientifi c approach in engineering and has been in use 
among steelmakers for more than half a century. Two different approaches exist, i.e., 
physical modeling and mathematical modeling, and both have been popular in steel-
making. While physical models have provided useful insight into liquid metal fl ows 
and associated mass transfer in converters, ladles, tundishes, molds, etc. mathemati-
cal models, on the other hand, have played pivotal roles in process design, develop-
ment, and control of steelmaking processes. Modeling has contributed immensely 
to help reduce production cost, specifi c energy consumption, waste generation, and 
so on, and is anticipated to play increasingly important roles in modernization of 
steel mills, adoption of newer technology, reduction of green house gas emission, 
etc. in the days to come. In such efforts, both physical modeling and mathematical 
modeling are likely to be involved. Principles of physical modeling together with its 
potentials and limitations are discussed in this chapter. A set of signifi cant model 
study programs together with some worked examples is also included to elucidate 
the underlying concepts better.
3.2 PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL MODELING
Modeling in steelmaking is concerned with the study of a given phenomenon say, 
nitrogen pick up during tapping of a basic oxygen furnace (BOF), taking place in 
a reactor or a furnace. The industrial unit, i.e., furnace, ladle, etc. is known as the 
prototype or the full-scale system and its physical replica as the “physical model” 
or simply “model.” Accordingly, it is customary to refer to all attributes like dimen-
sions, operating parameters, fl uid, etc. with reference to either the full scale or the 
model systems. Depending on the liquid used in physical models to represent molten 
steel, physical models can either be a cold/room temperature model or a high tem-
perature model. The latter typically uses molten steel as the representative fl uid. This 
could at times be a “pilot-scale” system. Similarly, cold models frequently use water, 

100 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
mercury, etc. instead of molten steel. Physical models in which water is used to simu-
late molten steel are known as “water models” or “aqueous models” and have been 
extremely popular in steelmaking. A physical model is constructed by respecting 
four different states of similarity, namely:
 
1. Geometrical similarity
 
2. Mechanical similarity
 
3. Thermal similarity
 
4. Chemical similarity
It is based on the above, dimensions and operating conditions of a full-scale system 
are scaled down (prototype → model) or those of a laboratory-scale model scaled up 
(model → prototype). A possible subdivision of physical models commonly employed 
in steelmaking is shown in Figure 3.1.
3.2.1 GEOMETRICAL SIMILARITY
Geometrical similarity is based on the similarity of shapes. Two bodies are said to be 
geometrically similar when, for every point in one body, there exists a corresponding 
point in the other. Such point-to-point geometrical correspondence normally allows 
a single characteristic linear dimension to be used in representing the size of model 
and prototype. For instance, a cylindrical model ladle in the laboratory can be rep-
resented by its diameter, Dmod, and compared to its equivalent full-scale counterpart, 
Dprot, and their ratio expressed in terms of the geometrical scale factor, λ, as

Geometrical similarity therefore implies, if the prototype is fi lled with a liquid up to a 
depth of Lprot (measured, say, from the base of the ladle), the model ladle must accord-
ingly be fi lled to Lmod, such that, Lmod/Lprot = λ = Dmod/Dprot. Similarly, if the prototype 
is tapered and has different basal and top diameters, a geometrically similar model 
must also be accordingly tapered to have Dmod, base/Dprot, base = Dmod, top/Dprot, top = λ, 
implying essentially that the degree of taper in the two systems be identical. This 
is illustrated schematically in Figure 3.2. At times, depending on the phenomena 
investigated, it may not be necessary to have complete geometrical similarity between 
the model and the prototype. For example, if fl oatation of a slag particle through a 
quiescent steel melt is to be studied via an aqueous analog, it is not required to con-
sider and scale all the physical dimensions of the actual system. Scaling the liquid 
head alone, rather than the width or radius of the vessel suffi ces in this case. Grossly, 
such a model may seem to be distorted but still provides the desired information as 
does a totally faithful model.
Some elements of unwanted distortion may, however, remain in physical model 
studies, as it is diffi cult to achieve the complete geometrical similarity always. For 
example, the perfect similarity of nozzle shape and size between a full scale and 
a water model tundish is diffi cult, as refractory erosion, inclusion deposition, etc. 
infl uence the geometry of drainage nozzle. Given that, nozzle discharge coeffi cients 
in the two systems are likely to be different. Furthermore, the shape of an industrial 
rector may undergo considerable changes during operation due to phenomena such 
as erosion of refractories, solidifi cation of metal and slag, and so on. Some approxi-
mations are therefore inevitable and inherent to the building of a physical model. The 
insight into a modeler plays important roles in such context.
3.2.2 MECHANICAL SIMILARITY
Mechanical similarity deals with the similarity of forces and related entities such as 
momentum and velocity. It is compartmentalized into three categories, namely, static 
similarity, dynamic similarity, and kinematic similarity. Static similarity is not much 
important in steelmaking except in the study of forces acting on the walls of hold-
ing vessels, forces required to move/rotate furnaces, sudden movement of transfer

vessels, etc. During steelmaking, a reactor typically remains stationary while liquid 
steel contained in it moves due to externally applied forces (buoyancy force during 
gas stirring, gravitational force in transfer operations, and so on). Within the mov-
ing melt, phases interact, chemical reactions take place, and reaction products are 
formed and eliminated aiding overall refi ning of liquid steel. Therefore, in order to 
develop adequate understanding of the steelmaking process dynamics, the study of 
various forces responsible for the motion of the steel melt (or, loosely fl ows) is far 
more important than those that held a reactor stationary.
Melt fl ow in furnaces, ladles, transfer and holding vessels, etc. is the result of 
various forces such as pressure, inertial, viscous, surface tension, gravitational 
forces, etc. acting on liquid steel. Dynamic similarity is concerned with the simi-
larity of such forces that accelerate or retard fl uid motion in moving systems and 
implies that corresponding forces acting at corresponding times and corresponding 
locations in the model and prototype should also correspond. The term “correspond” 
here essentially implies that the ratio of the forces under consideration is a constant 
between the two systems, the model and the prototype.
The question that we need to address now is how do we know all the relevant 
forces in a moving fl uid? Given the applicable momentum conservation equation, this 
is trivial; a mere look at the equation indicates the nature of various forces acting on 
the system. For example, consider the fl ow of a homogeneous liquid through a pipe. 
The applicable momentum conservation equation along the axial direction, x, is

This at once indicates that inertial, viscous, pressure, and gravitational forces are 
relevant. Each term in Equation 3.2 is further explained in Table 3.1. Dynamic simi-
larity between two systems, the model and the prototype, therefore requires that at 
corresponding location and time, the following relationships hold.

Equations 3.4 through 3.6 state that dynamic similarity criteria are essentially ratios 
of various forces and represent different dimensionless groups or numbers. Frequently 
encountered dimensionless numbers in physical modeling of steelmaking are pre-
sented in Table 3.2. More comprehensive lists are available in [1,2]. It is through the 
equality of various dimensionless groups, dynamic similarity between the model and 
the prototype is established. In isothermal fl ow modeling, the following equalities are 
generally important:

(3.10)
Dimensionless groups, shown in Table 3.2, are generally expressed in terms of a 
characteristic velocity and a length scale and these must be appropriately defi ned. 
In many instances, this is not straightforward as several velocity and length scales 
are encountered in actual multidimensional fl ow systems. Dimensionless groups are 
evaluated on the basis of a priori knowledge of velocity, length scale, etc. at some 
given point/location in the system. For example, velocity, nozzle/orifi ce diameter, etc. 
are generally known at fl ow inlets. It is therefore convenient to express dimensionless 
numbers viz., Reynolds, Froude, etc. on the basis of inlet velocity and dimension.
Similarity criteria derived from the governing equations alone are not suffi cient. 
The boundary conditions must also be parallely considered and appropriate crite-
ria evolved. In physical modeling of fl ows in geometrically similar systems, this 
is not an issue of concern since velocity boundary conditions in both the model 
and the prototype are naturally similar. However, this is not so always, as shown in

the description of deriving thermal similarity criteria in Section 3.2.3. In situations 
where equations of motion are not known to start with, dimensional analysis is car-
ried out to identify the dimensionless groups governing the fl ow.
In physical modeling of molten steel fl ows, it may not be always possible to respect 
equality of all the dimensionless groups involved. For example, in homogeneous 
isothermal fl ows, inertial, gravitational, viscous, and pressure forces are important 
and hence Froude, Reynolds, and Euler numbers are only signifi cant. Equivalence 
of Froude and Reynolds numbers therefore ensures dynamic similarity between two 
geometrically similar systems.* However, in reduced scale modeling (i.e., λ < 1.0), 
with water representing molten steel, it is impossible to respect both Reynolds and 
Froude number equalities simultaneously. This is so as the kinematic viscosity of 
steel at 1873 K is practically equivalent to that of water at 298 K. As a rule, relatively 
less important forces are ignored and the corresponding dimensionless number is 
sacrifi ced. Two possibilities exist and accordingly, fl ows are assumed to be domi-
nated by either viscous force or inertial and gravitational forces.
* Froude and Reynolds similarity automatically entails Euler number equivalence. This follows from the 
dimensionless form of Equation 3.2 expressed as 
=
1 Eu
(Re,Fr)
f
.
  

106 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Dynamic similarity criteria for the two limiting cases are formulated via the 
Reynolds equality, i.e., (Re)mod = (Re)prot, and the Froude equality, i.e., Frmod = Frprot, 
respectively. Equivalence of Reynolds number implies that velocity at corresponding 
location and time varies in proportion to λ. In contrast, Froude similarity entails 
velocity dependence in proportion to λ.
In steelmaking, the size of reactors is often large and the intensity of stirring or 
motion is appreciable. Furthermore, since the kinematic viscosity 
ρ
= µ/
(
) of steel is 
extremely small (~10−6 m2/s), Reynolds number associated with such fl ows is often 
signifi cant (>104 or so). In contrast, the Froude number is two to three orders of mag-
nitude smaller. These therefore suggest that relative to the inertial forces, the contri-
bution of viscous forces to the fl ow is small and hence, can be ignored. In reduced 
scale aqueous model studies of steelmaking, fl ows are therefore frequently taken to 
be dominated by inertial and gravitational forces. Equation 3.8 therefore represents 
dynamic similarity between model and full-scale systems if surface tension forces 
are unimportant. Such idealizations are however not needed in full-scale model stud-
ies (i.e., λ = 1) or if a different liquid, other than water, is employed to represent 
molten steel. Despite that, deriving a dynamic similarity criterion for any given fl ow 
situation is not always straightforward and embodies considerable idealizations and 
approximations.
Worked Example 3.1
Deriving a dynamic similarity criterion for isothermal fl ows in a slag-free, gas-
stirred ladle system.
Dynamic similarity criterion in any fl ow system, as pointed out earlier, is derived 
on the basis of relevant dimensionless groups that are representative of the vari-
ous forces acting on the system. The forces and hence corresponding dimension-
less groups are known from the applicable equations of motion or the momentum 
conservation equations. Assuming a steady, isothermal fl ow in which only pressure, 
inertial, gravitational, and viscous forces are important, the equation of motion is 
represented in the following dimensionless form [3]:
 
1 =
(Re,Fr)
Eu
f
Since fl ows in steelmaking reactors (BOF, ladle, mold, etc.) are generally taken to 
be Froude dominated*, dynamic similarity between model and full-scale systems is 
* Incorporating typical industrial vessel dimension (L = D = 3 m) and kinematic viscosity of  molten 
steel (~10−6 m2/s), the Reynolds and Froude numbers are estimated to be 3 × 106uc and 0.034u2
c, 
respectively Gas stirred systems are reasonably agitated and hence Reynolds number is expected to 
be substantially larger than Froude number. Since Reynolds number represents the ratio of inertial to 
viscous forces, a large Reynolds number consequently implies that the viscous force relative to the 
inertial force is small. Therefore, the role of viscous force is ignored and fl ow phenomena taken to be 
essentially dominated by inertial and gravitational forces, i.e., Froude dominated.

dictated solely by the Froude criterion, i.e., (Fr)mod = (Fr)prot. In other words, for the 
two ladle systems to be dynamically similar, the ratio of the inertial to the buoyancy 
forces must be identical. To proceed further, appropriate expressions of inertial and 
buoyancy forces in steelmaking ladles are needed.
A schematic of the gas-stirred ladle system together with a corresponding ide-
alized version is shown in Figure 3.3. Since buoyancy is operational in the plume 
region, we can express the buoyancy force acting on the system on the basis of an 
average gas volume fraction in the plume and its dimension as

The corresponding expression for inertial force is not naturally forthcoming as

manner for a gas-stirred ladle.† However, the fl ow is predominantly unidimensional 
within the plume and consequently, on the basis of the diameter of the plume and

port along all directions is important.

This suggests that characteristic velocity and length scales in a gas-stirred ladle 
system are, respectively, the plume rise velocity, UP, and the depth of liquid, L. 
Embodying an appropriate plume velocity expression in the preceding expression, 
the desired relationship between model and full-scale operating fl ow rates is estab-
lished. For example, considering UP∞Q0.33 L0.25 R−0.58 (Section 8.3.1) in the above, we 
can readily show that Qmod = λ5/2Qprot. Froude number thus defi ned, i.e.,

is generally referred to as the “ladle Froude number.”
In moving systems, in addition to dynamic similarity, one may also be concerned 
with kinematic similarity. Moving systems, which that geometrically similar are also 
kinematically similar provided individual particles trace out paths of the same shape 
in both the model and the prototype in corresponding intervals of time. Conversely, 
similar events in the model and the prototype correspond in time provided paths fol-
lowed are geometrically similar (i.e., these are in proportion to λ) and a characteristic 
relationship between velocity scales (i.e., dynamically similar) holds. This is illustrated 
in Table 3.3 and indicates that geometrically and dynamically similar systems are also 
kinematically similar. A necessary refl ection of kinematic similarity between the two 
systems is the similarity of fl ow patterns or trajectory of individual fl uid elements.
To illustrate this further, subsurface trajectories of a spherical-shaped alloying 
addition in a full-scale ladle and an aqueous model system are shown in Figure 
3.4. In order that the low-temperature analog on the right be a true representative 
of the actual industrial operation such that the trajectories are geometrically simi-
lar, it is necessary that solid spheres trace out geometrically similar paths in the 
* Average gas volume fraction (= volume of gas/volume of plume) within argon–liquid steel plume does 
not vary appreciably with gas fl ow rates. This is so as plumes tend to be wider with increasing gas 
fl ows. Moreover, gas volume fractions in industrial as well as model ladle systems are known to be 
small varying typically between 2% and 5%.

corresponding interval of time. The criteria that ensure this are derived from the 
governing equation of the subsurface motion of a solid in a liquid (Section 6.2).
3.2.3 THERMAL SIMILARITY
Nonisothermal systems can be physically modeled by maintaining thermal similarity. 
Thermal similarity in systems that are in motion (e.g., liquid steel in a steelmaking fur-
nace, ladle, or mold) necessitate dynamic or kinematic similarity as a “prerequisite.” 
This is so as heat transfer rates are infl uenced by convection or fl ow. Two systems are 
said to be thermally similar in which temperature differences at corresponding loca-
tions and time bear a constant ratio to one another. This is achieved when heat transfer 
rates by conduction, convection, radiation, and generation (or dissipation) to a certain 
location in the model bear a fi xed ratio to the corresponding rates at corresponding 
locations in the full-scale systems. Mathematically this is equivalent to

Thermal similarity criteria are also derived from the governing heat fl ow equation 
following essentially the procedure outlined in Section 3.2.2. Thermal similarity is 
diffi cult to achieve in practice, particularly in water models, due to the following 
reasons:

* Prandtl number is defi ned as ν/α and is equivalent to Pe/Re. Prandtl number of molten steel and water 
differs by almost a factor of 35. Such dissimilarity becomes a matter of concern for nonisothermal 
modeling of steel fl ows through water model, particularly when the fl ow is laminar (i.e., some free 
convecting fl ows). Thermal similarity between the two systems particularly in the vicinity of solid 
walls/baffl es, etc. is unlikely to be maintained exactly.
† Similarity criteria are generally derived governing equations applicable under laminar fl ow condi-
tions. This is so as effective viscosity, turbulent thermal conductivity, etc. embodied in governing 
turbulent fl ow/heat transfer equations are problem-dependent parameters. Clearly, v = f(L, µ, ρ, 
g, …) is more appropriate than v = f(L, µe, ρ, g, …) since µe, unlike µ, is truly not an independent 
variable.
‡ Boussinesq approximation (Section 5.2.2) is invoked here and accordingly, transport of momentum 
due to thermal buoyancy included in the analysis. The relative importance of thermal buoyancy vis-à-
vis bulk convection is governed by the ratio Gr/Re2.

In a similar manner, boundary conditions are considered to derive additional criteria. 
Finite heat loss occurs through various surfaces such as, vessel walls, free surface, 
etc. These must be considered before thermal similarity criteria are formulated com-
pletely. Taking a simplistic stand and considering similar heat fl uxes prevailing over 
various surfaces, the average, outgoing heat fl ux in the two systems, 1 and 2, are 
correlated via their respective bulk cooling rates as [4]

mathematically, fulfi lling all criteria in practice is diffi cult, particularly through 
Perspex models. For example, taking λ = 0.3, heat fl ux of the order of 1 kW/m2 
through the walls of a Perspex* model tundish is to be ensured to have a similarity 
with actual heat fl ux operating through frontal and side walls of an industrial-scale 
tundish system (~5 kW/m2). Clearly, an approach beyond transparent water models is 
needed to study the thermal similarity effectively.
3.2.4 CHEMICAL SIMILARITY
Chemical similarity refers to the similarity of concentration profi les in the model 
and the full-scale systems. Two systems exhibit chemical similarity in which con-
centration differences at corresponding locations and time bear a constant ratio to 
one another. This is achieved when rate of mass transfer by diffusion, convection, 
and generation (or dissipation) through chemical reaction at a certain location in 
the model bear a fi xed ratio to the corresponding rates and location in the full-scale 
systems. Mathematically, this is equivalent to

The concentration profi le in reacting fl ow systems is a function of both mass transfer 
and chemical reaction rates. While the transport of mass depends on fl ow, reaction 
rates on the other hand are temperature dependent. These necessitate that dynamic 
and thermal similarity between model and full-scale systems are fi rst addressed before 
chemical similarity. Chemical similarity is impossible to achieve in cold models 
owing to the strong dependence of reaction kinetics on temperature (Section 2.6).
3.3 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS
Dimensional analysis is frequently used in process engineering to represent 
a physical phenomenon in terms of a mathematical equation that is essentially 
dimensionless. The technique is generally applied to

2. Determine the minimum possible numbers of variables required to defi ne

3. Scale down or scale up results
Casting a dimensional equation into an appropriate nondimensional form and 
the subsequent derivation of similarity criteria is already illustrated in Worked 
Example 3.2. In the following, dimensional analysis is primarily discussed from the 
viewpoint of formulating a relationship between various measurable quantities in a 
nondimensional format. More elaborate discussion on the topic is available in [5].
3.3.1 RALEIGH’S METHOD OF INDICES
Dimensional analysis is based on the method of indices, an algebraic procedure 
fi rst enunciated by Lord Raleigh. In this method, it is assumed that the relationship 
between different physical quantities can be expressed as the product of power func-
tions.* Therefore, the relationship between a dependent variable, x0, and independent 
variables x1, x2, x3, etc. is expressed as

(3.13)
in which C1, a, b, c, etc. are constants. The preceding relationship is converted to an 
equivalent equation in which different variables (viz., x0, x1, x2, x3, etc.) are arranged 
in dimensionless groups or numbers X0, X1, X2, X3, etc. and represented as

 etc. are constants. The procedure for transforming a dimen-
sional equation into its nondimensional equivalent is further elucidated in the Worked 
Example 3.3.
3.3.2 BUCKINGHAM p THEOREM
The π theorem is frequently used in dimensional analysis to determine the number 
of dimensionless groups that one can expect in the analysis of any given physical 
phenomenon. For example, any dimensionally homogeneous equation G(α,β,χ,δ,…) 
can be expressed as

in which the π’s are the independent products of the arguments α, β, χ, δ,… which 
are essentially dimensionless. The number of π groups in the resulting dimensionless 
equation is equivalent to E – F in which F represents the total number of primary

facts to test such a supposition.

quantities such as length, mass, temperature, time, etc. and E represents the total 
number of independent and dependent variables governing the process. The π theo-
rem and the Raleigh’s method of indices are applied in conjunction to deduce nondi-
mensional relationship among various measurable quantities.

Consequently, on the basis of π theorem, we can expect two independent π groups 
(viz., E – F = 2) to represent the preceding relationship in a dimensionless form. The

“d” are expressed entirely in terms of “a,” i.e., c = a − 1 and d = −2a + 1. Therefore, 
the functional relationship can be recast in the following nondimensional format:

The two π groups produced can look markedly different, should one decide to elimi-

such results will be consistent as one dimensionless form is deduced from the other 
by mere manipulation of the possible π groups.
3.4 CHOICE OF SCALE FACTOR AND WORKING FLUID
The starting point in a physical model investigation is the choice of an appropriate 
 geometrical-scale factor. This determines the size of the model vessel. As a rule of 
thumb, the scale factor must be so chosen that fl ow regimes in the model are similar to 
those in the full-scale system. As fl ows in steelmaking reactors are generally turbulent, 
it is therefore important that scale factor is not too small. On the other hand, full-scale

models (e.g., λ = 1) are prohibitively expensive and therefore not generally desirable. 
Also many features of high temperature steelmaking operations cannot be replicated 
exactly in full-scale water models. A compromise is therefore needed. Most importantly, 
the scale of the model and the operating parameters therein be such that characteristics 
of the full-scale fl ows are reasonably preserved in the model system. For example, while 
a relatively small size (say, λ ~ 0.2 or so) vessel might be adequate to simulate tapping 
operation in the laboratory, a relatively large vessel is desirable to simulate tundish fl ow. 
This is so as fl ows in tundish are signifi cantly weaker and therefore less turbulent than 
those encountered in fi lling ladles.* Thus a small laboratory-scale tundish may not neces-
sarily produce enough turbulence and hence lead to deviations from the full-scale behav-
ior. As vessel size decreases, the importance of Reynolds number relative to Froude 
number increases and this tends to distort model outcome somewhat. Adequate process 
knowledge and insight of a modeler often help decide an appropriate scale factor.
Once the scale factor is decided, an appropriate working fl uid is identifi ed 
and operating parameters scaled down from their full-scale values. As shown in 
Table 3.4 water at 298 K and molten steel at 1873 K have nearly the same kinematic 
viscosity (=µ/ρ). This is important and helps ensure similar fl ow regimes even in a 
small-scale model. Flow phenomena in steelmaking systems are therefore frequently 
investigated through water models. The following are the primary reasons for the 
popularity of water models
 
1. Cheap and ready availability of water
 
2. Convenience to work (viz., it is noncorrosive, neutral, and so on)
 
3. Low capital and operating cost of models
 
4. Easy visualization of fl ow
In isothermal fl ow modeling, operating parameters are determined solely from the 
dynamic similarity criterion, while both dynamic and thermal similarity criteria are 
considered for nonisothermal situations. Equating relevant dimensionless groups 
between model and full-scale systems, the operating parameters in the model are 
deduced. Needless to mention, once a decision is made in favor of a reduced scale 
model and water as the representative liquid, it is no longer possible to respect the 
similarity of all such dimensional groups. As pointed out earlier, as a rule of thumb, 
the infl uence of Reynolds number on the fl ow is generally ignored. Given that, Froude 
similitude alone dictates isothermal fl ow modeling of steelmaking systems.
Froude number is a function of velocity and length. Thus, thermophysical properties 
of the fl uid such as viscosity, density, etc. are not expected to exert any infl uence on fl ow 
in the Froude dominated fl ow regime. This therefore implies that any liquid can in prin-
ciple be used to represent molten steel in the Froude dominated fl ow regime. However 
due to numerous advantages enumerated above, water becomes the most obvious choice 
for molten steel. Once decisions are made on the scale factor and the working fl uid, 
full-scale operating parameters are readily scaled down through appropriate similarity 
criteria. This is illustrated further through a Worked Example 3.4.
* Mathematical modeling of industrial-scale steel processing units suggest that volume average melt 
speed in tundish is of the order of cm/s while those in fi lling ladles are of the order of m/s.

Geometrical similarity also necessitates that the gas injector in the model is located 
at identical dimensionless radial distance, i.e., 2/3R.
It is not mandatory to scale the dimension of the gas injection device, since gas-
stirred ladles are essentially potential energy driven. Given that (Section 8.3.1), 
details of nozzles or orifi ces are not critical to the modeling of fl ow. In principle, any 
gas injection device such as a nozzle or a lance suffi ces as long as the rate of kinetic 
energy supply remains negligibly small. Similarly, since ρsteel >> ρAr, any common 
gas can in principle be injected in the model. The density of gases like air, nitrogen, 
etc. is insignifi cant relative to the density of water.
The injected gas under steelmaking condition undergoes signifi cant expansion 
in volume. Accordingly, the intensity of stirring induced in steelmaking systems 
is many folds larger than one would anticipate on the basis of a gas fl ow that is 
referenced to normal temperature and pressure (NTP) or standard temperature and 
pressure (STP). In contrast, expansion of an injected gas is negligibly small in water

models. Therefore, the gas fl ow rate under actual steelmaking condition is required 
to be scaled down and employed, if dynamically similar fl ow conditions are to be 
ensured in the model. This necessitates fi xing a reference state for the steelmaking 
system. The most convenient to work with is 1873 K and a total pressure correspond-
ing to the mean bath depth level. On that basis, the gas fl ow rate referenced to NTP 
can be easily translated to actual steelmaking conditions as

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
3.5 LIMITATIONS OF WATER MODELING
Use of a small-scale factor, idealization of fl ow in terms of Froude number, mismatch 
of Prandtl number between water and liquid steel, etc. are inherent to aqueous mod-
eling and lead to some uncertainties. Of greater concern perhaps is our inability to 
realistically represent the multiphase nature of steelmaking systems, comprising gas, 
slag, and metal through water models. Indeed, actual slag–metal density and slag–
metal interfacial tensions are impossible to achieve in any aqueous  system. Physical 
model studies with oil or organic solvents as the upper phase liquid (slag) are there-
fore approximate. In many water model investigations, the presence of an upper slag 
phase is entirely ignored, i.e., as illustrated in Worked Example 3.1. Similarly, slag 
metal reactions such as De–S, De–P, etc. and portioning of S and P between slag 
and metal are not replicated even reasonably through any combination of liquids in 
a water model. It is now generally acknowledged that physical processes occurring 
in a high-temperature steelmaking system involving metal–slag–gas are impossible 
to recreate in water models.
Consequently, inferences of actual steelmaking process drawn solely from water 
model studies with or without an upper buoyant phase are likely to be largely inad-
equate. One may of course use a relatively lighter fl uid such as oil or an organic 
liquid over a bath of water and thereby gain qualitatively some useful insight into 
the multiphase, steelmaking systems. For example, it is now known with reasonable 
certainty that the upper slag phase interacts with the bulk liquid steel to retard melt 
fl ow and the associated heat and mass transfer kinetics [6].
The volumetric mass transfer coeffi cient* in a gas-agitated water–oil bath,  measured 
by monitoring the concentration of a partitioning tracer within the aqueous phase, is 
shown [7] in Figure 3.6 as a function of gas fl ow rate. This shows that depending on 
the intensity of gas fl ow, markedly different relationships exist between volumetric 
mass transfer coeffi cient, kmA, and gas fl ow rate, Q (viz., stage I: kmA ∝ Q0.6, stage 
II: kmA ∝ Q0.5, and stage III: kmA ∝ Q1.43). In the in-set of the same fi gure, equiva-
lent results from a pilot-scale steelmaking ladle [8] are shown to strike a compari-
son between behaviors of actual steelmaking and aqueous systems. There, although 
three distinct relationships between volumetric mass transfer coeffi cients and gas 
fl ow rates are apparent, a closer look at these indicates that relationships between 
volumetric mass transfer coeffi cients and gas fl ow rates in the high temperature 
system are different from those in the water model. This essentially suggests that 
an aqueous system is unlikely to quantitatively replicate many intricate features of a 
reacting multiphase system. This is largely acknowledged in the literature. Despite 
that, the role of water models in steelmaking process analysis can hardly be under-
mined as this provides useful insight into fl ow (high velocity and dead regions), 
mixing, and melt phase mass transport-controlled processes, and so on, which is 
otherwise diffi cult.
* Volumetric mass transfer coeffi cient is the product of mass transfer coeffi cient and interfacial area 
(Section 8.3.6).

3.6  SCALING UP OF RESULT AND FULL-SCALE PREDICTION
The primary goal of any physical model study is to make in situ observation of 
 certain physical phenomena and therefrom, predict the same in the full-scale system 
via appropriate scale-up criteria. Such an objective is diffi cult to fulfi ll since physi-
cal models, as enumerated above, are often inexact. Mismatch between model and 
full scale, be these dimensions or operating conditions or thermophysical properties 
of the fl uids, induces deviations, thereby making direct scale-up of model results 
uncertain. Rarely, therefore, physical model results are extrapolated to full-scale sys-
tems in a straightforward fashion. Merits of physical modeling rest on its ability to 
provide useful information on and insight into steelmaking conveniently and in a 
cost-effective manner.
Consider, for example, the subsurface motion of a spherical-shaped solid in a liquid 
bath, as in the typical alloying addition procedure. Starting with an appropriate equa-
tion of motion (i.e., Newton’s second law [see Problem 3.11]) and geometrically 
similar systems, it is readily shown that complete dynamic similarity between model 
(λ ≠ 1) and full-scale systems is diffi cult since drag coeffi cients* are different in the

two systems. Subsurface trajectories in the two systems are therefore unlikely to be 
completely geometrically identical. In addition, phenomena such as initial entry of 
a solid through a slag layer and freezing and remelting of slag/steel shell around the 
cold object in actual practice complicate the issue of similarity further since there 
is no counterpart of such in the aqueous model. Thus we can conclude, subsurface 
trajectories, total immersion times, maximum penetration depths, etc. extrapolated 
from an aqueous model study are likely to be only reasonably representative of the 
industrial alloying addition procedure.
3.7  EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN AQUEOUS MODELING
Without companion measurements no modeling study is complete. Measurements 
and modeling are therefore regarded as two interdependent requirements of any 
modern day process analysis, design, and optimization effort. Physical modeling 
is applied to practically every engineering discipline encompassing a variety of 
geometry, fl uids, operating conditions, and so on. Accordingly, numerous experi-
mental techniques devoted to different types of measurements have been developed 
[9,10]. In physical modeling of steelmaking, typically phases, velocity, temperature, 
composition, etc. are measured. As scope is limited, a few experimental techniques 
relevant to fl ow visualization, measurements of velocity, turbulence and phases in 
two-phase fl ows as well as heat and mass transport are summarized briefl y in the 
following paragraphs.
Flow visualization provides a snapshot of the fl ow fi eld and represents a useful 
tool for studying instantaneous fl ow characteristics. The tracer method is the most 
widely used fl ow visualization technique and includes the following procedures:
 
1. Injection method: In this, typically a dye (say, KMnO4 solution) or neutrally 
buoyant fi ne particles (polyamide- or silver-coated glass bubbles; ~10 µm) 
are injected into the fl owing stream of liquid and the fl ow is observed/
detected by following the trajectory of the added dye/particles. By not-
ing time and corresponding displacement of particles on any specifi c plane 
(i.e., obtained through a digital movie camera), a fi rsthand estimate of 
in-plane velocity magnitude can be made.
 
2. Suspension method: The nature of fl ow can be understood from the move-
ment of suitable tracers (say, small pieces of silk threads) suspended suitably 
within a fl ow domain.
Currently, it is not possible to visualize and measure velocity of molten steel in ladles, 
furnaces, mold, etc. as probes capable of working in steelmaking environment on a 
sustained basis are generally lacking. On the other hand, many types of fl ow mea-
surement devices are applied to measure velocity and turbulence characteristics in 
equivalent aqueous systems. These, for example, include
 
1. Pitot tube: This is used to measure average or mean velocity under steady 
fl ow conditions. The device does not directly measure velocity but provides 
an estimate of the fl uid pressure at the stagnation point, which is translated to 
  

Elements of Physical Modeling 
123
a corresponding velocity.* The Pitot tube is best suited for  measurements of 
unidirectionally moving, homogeneous fl ows in a relatively large domain.
 
2. Hot wire anemometer: This exploits the relationship between heat transfer 
from a heated wire and the velocity of the surrounding fl ow† and works 
satisfactorily provided heat transfer rate is controlled by forced convec-
tion. Such anemometers as Pitot tubes, are intrusive devices. The wire is 
generally made from platinum or tungsten and has a thickness of about 
2–10 µm. If a fi lm is used instead of a wire, the device is called a “hot fi lm 
anemometer.” A hot wire/fi lm anemometer can measure velocity in fl uids 
below 373 K and has been used in cold models operated with water as well 
as mercury.
 
3. Laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV): This works based on the principle 
of Doppler Effect and measures the frequency shift as an incident laser 
is scattered from a moving particle. This is a noninvasive method and 
therefore, unlike the two aforementioned techniques, does not disturb the 
fl ow. Typically, the circulating bath is seeded with neutrally buoyant fi ne 
particles which are assumed to be moving with the fl ow without any sig-
nifi cant relative velocity. When laser issuing from a source is focused 
at a predetermined location within the fl ow domain through appropriate 
optical devices, the seed particles scatter light which is picked up by a 
photodetector. A signal processor analyzes the scattered light signal and 
based on that, an inference of the particle’s (or liquid’s) velocity is made. 
LDV, unlike Pitot tube or hot wire anemometer, can measure both the 
instantaneous as well as fl uctuating velocity components and are there-
fore, ideally suited for turbulent fl ows. The optical system used in a LDV 
is shown in Figure 3.7.
 
4. Particle image velocimeter (PIV): PIV is a technique for measuring the 
velocity of a transparent fl uid and has found signifi cant use in physical 
modeling of steelmaking operations. The genesis of the technique is fl ow 
* From engineering Bernoulli’s equation, a correlation between stagnation pressure and corresponding 
velocity is derived as 
ρ
=
2 2/
v
p
; in which, ρ is the density of fl uid. This way, knowledge of stagnation 
pressure allows velocity estimation.
† Steady state energy balance provides an estimate of heat transfer coeffi cient which is uniquely related 
to fl uid velocity via a forced convective heat transfer correlation i.e., Nu = f(Re, Pr).

visualization that is used in fl uid mechanics for much of the last century. 
Those fl ow visualization techniques, as pointed out earlier, included adding 
neutrally buoyant particles to a transparent fl uid and taking time exposure 
photographs that showed the “streaklines” of the fl ow as the particles were 
swept along. In some instances the techniques were extended from mere 
visualization to quantitative determination of velocities by, for example, 
measuring streakline length or frame-to-frame movement of particles in a 
movie of the fl ow [11,12]. The tedium of such techniques, particularly in 
the case of turbulent fl ows where many measurements had to be made to 
get an ensemble averaged velocity at each point of interest in the fl ow, is 
obvious. The advent of software for analyzing images greatly facilitated 
measurements, and commercial instruments were developed to permit rapid 
measurement of velocities at numerous locations in the fl ow fi eld.
One type of commercial instrument is illustrated in Figure 3.8 [13]. A 
“light sheet” is created by passing a laser beam through a cylindrical lens. 
Particles suspended in the fl ow are illuminated when they are in the plane 
of the light sheet and their image is captured by a charge-coupled device 
(CCD) camera connected to a computer. In the system shown in the fi gure, 
the laser is pulsed and two overlapped images are captured by the camera. 
Image analysis software then determines the correlation between the two 
overlapped images, fi xing the distance that particles have moved in each

region of the image from one laser pulse to the next. The software does 
this in a localized way, breaking the image up into “interrogation areas,” 
each a few tens of pixels square (compared to a digital image that is sev-
eral hundred pixels square), and attempting the correlation in each area. 
Typically each interrogation area contains the order of ten particle image 
pairs. Knowing the interval between successive laser pulses, the velocity 
fi eld throughout the light sheet is found. The light sheet is then moved to 
another position to determine velocities in another plane.
As described, the technique is known as “autocorrelation PIV” and suf-
fers from the obvious disadvantage that there is an ambiguity about the fl ow 
direction; it is not obvious which of the two particle images in the overlapped 
exposures is the fi rst and which is the second. This poses minor diffi culties in 
laminar fl ow where the direction of fl ow is usually known a priori but causes 
substantial diffi culty in turbulent fl ow where frequent reversal of the fl ow can 
be expected. There are some mechanical ways to circumvent such diffi culties 
but all are cumbersome compared to “cross-correlation PIV” in which the 
CCD camera records two separate images (a particle appears once in each 
of the two images) so it is known where a particle was fi rst and where it was 
next. Until recently, cross-correlation PIV was limited, by the unavailability 
of CCD cameras, required to capture images rapidly. What is signifi cant is the 
frame speed of the camera (the interval that must elapse before the next image 
is acquired), and not the shutter speed (the time necessary to acquire each 
image). For example, most CCD movie cameras capture images at 30 frames/s 
and, for “fast” fl ows, this is too slow as particles can move too far between 
images, or even out of the light sheet, to permit the correlation. Fortunately 
CCD cameras that have both a fast frame rate and a reasonable price are now 
available so that cross-correlation PIV becomes possible for faster fl ows. For 
such PIV a pulsed laser is not an essential requirement, as the cameras frame 
speed is now the signifi cant determinant of particle movement from image to 
image. Specialized CCD cameras that capture only two frames are available 
but CCD fast movie cameras are comparable in price and performance and 
provide more fl exibility (e.g., the opportunity to compare images that are from 
well-separated frames, rather than adjacent ones, or multiple pairs of frames 
over a short interval in real time). It is to be noted that in both autocorrelation 
PIV and cross-correlation PIV, the algorithm determining the velocity fi eld is 
one that establishes a correlation between image pairs; rather than one where 
individual particles are tracked (in the sense of radar tracking an aircraft). 
When particles move out of (or into) the light sheet, there is an obvious loss of 
correlation between image pairs indeed, that loss of correlation is some mea-
sure of the velocity component normal to the plane of the light sheet. Such a 
straightforward interpretation in turbulent fl ows is however not obvious.
The laser is often the most expensive component in a PIV system and, if 
the volume under study is large, as in water models of steel processing units, 
a laser of a few Watts power is required which is dangerous. With some 
loss of precision the laser can be replaced with safer and less expensive 
illumination, for example, by collimating the light from incandescent lamps 
or light-emitting diodes (LED) so as to produce a light sheet. The loss of 
  

126 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
precision arises from the fact that even a well-collimated light sheet widens 
much more than a laser beam as it passes through the volume under study. 
It is diffi cult for the sheet to be less than a few millimeters thick. If the vol-
ume under study is of the order of a meter in the direction perpendicular to 
the light sheet, as it is frequently the case with water models of steelmaking 
operations, the loss of precision is likely to be inconsequential.
The particles used in PIV should have a density close to that of the fl uid 
so that their settling/rising velocity in the stagnant fl uid is negligible (which 
is easily determined by the PIV system). Furthermore, they should be highly 
refl ective of the incident light so as to facilitate their showing up as bright 
images at the camera. The brightness of those images is improved if the 
particles are larger. However, too large particles do not respond to changes 
in fl ow direction in the same way as the surrounding fl uid, even if these have 
neutral buoyancy. Particles for which the image in the camera is one or two 
pixel diameters are usually satisfactory. In practice, this usually means par-
ticles of 10–100 µm in size. The best level of seeding of the particles is usu-
ally determined empirically. If the light sheet is thin and the level of seeding 
is too low, then too few particles remain in the light sheet from one image 
to the next and the loss of correlation is excessive. Furthermore, insuffi cient 
particles in the images do not give a statistically signifi cant correlation of 
particle movement in an interrogation area analyzed by the computer. A 
suffi cient level of seeding is never so high that the fl uid is rendered opaque. 
It is intuitive that the particle number concentration should be macroscopi-
cally uniform and Westerweel [14] has examined this criterion. More on this 
powerful technique, including guidelines on practical issues such as proper 
seeding of the fl ow with particles, etc. can be found in [14,15].
PIV and water models of furnaces, ladles, tundish, mold, etc. are now 
frequently applied in conjunction to investigate fl uid fl ow phenomena in 
steelmaking. In Chapter 5, application of PIV in steelmaking research, par-
ticularly in continuous casting mold, is described. In water models of cast-
ers, which frequently have a “mold” similar in size to the actual, the fl ow 
is turbulent and recirculating. PIV provides a way of rendering quantitative 
the fl ow fi eld; it is a much more effi cient way of determining the mean fl ow 
fi eld than earlier techniques such as the LDV. Similar needs for determin-
ing fl ow fi elds also exist in modeling of fl ows in the direct chill (DC) casters 
used in the aluminum industry and in casters used for copper alloys.

The drag probe, typically a regular geometry solid, e.g., a sphere or a cylinder is 
immersed at a predetermined location in a liquid to measure (say, via a strain gauge) 
drag force exerted on the solid by the moving fl uid. Drag force thus measured is 
translated to a representative velocity via Equation 3.16. The reliability of such mea-
surements generally depends on the accuracy with which drag coeffi cient, CD, is 
known. While all previously mentioned fl ow-measuring devices are not suitable for 
steel melts, a suitably designed drag probe, on the other hand, is found to work satis-
factorily under steelmaking environment [16].
Two-phase, gas-liquid fl ows have been extensively characterized using electrore-
sistivity probes that exploit dissimilar conductivity of liquid and gas. The resistivity 
probe is typically placed at the point of interest within the fl ow domain. Based on 
the probe’s intermittent interaction with the environment (comprising of bubbles and 
liquid) different electrical signals are generated. These form the basis for inference 
of gas voidage, bubble frequency, bubble rise velocity, etc. For example, the rising 
velocity of a bubble is determined by dividing the vertical distance between the two 
probe tips (in a two-needle electroresistivity probe) with the bubble’s travel time from 
the lower to the upper electrode tip. Electrical signals produced by a bubble provide a 
direct measure of such time. Electroresistivity probes are applied to aqueous as well as 
high-temperature gas-stirred systems. In order to ensure long life of the probe under 
high temperature conditions, the electrode material must be highly resistant to erosion 
and chemical reaction. Zirconia, ZrO2, covered platinum electrodes are found to work 
satisfactorily for steel melts. A typical two-needle probe used for measuring bubbles 
in liquid iron bath is shown in Figure 3.9. In addition, multineedle resistivity probes 
are also designed to infer bubbles, shapes, and size in gas-agitated systems [9].

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Heat and mass transfer play important roles and infl uence the process effi ciency 
of steelmaking. While measurements of temperature (via immersion thermocou-
ples, radiation pyrometers), heat fl ux (through fl ux meters), chemical composition 
(through a variety of analytical methods), etc. are frequent in the shop fl oor, these are 
not so popular in aqueous modeling. This is so as thermal and chemical phenomena 
are rarely investigated through water models. The following techniques are important 
in the present context:
 
1. Melting method: Weight loss technique is used to investigate melting rates 
of (a) ice in a water bath [17] and (b) solid metallic objects in a molten metal 
bath [18]. In this, load cells have been employed to record weight as a func-
tion of time. From such measurements, heat transfer coeffi cient is estimated 
and specifi c convective heat transfer correlations developed for predicting 
melting of scrap, alloying additions, etc. in a molten steel bath.
 
2. Weight loss method: Mass transfer from a dissolving solid body under isother-
mal condition is investigated via the weight loss technique. In aqueous system 
while benzoic acid compacts have been used, cylinders or spheres of high melt-
ing point material such as niobium or tungsten have been used in a molten steel 
bath [19]. From such measurements, specifi c convective mass transfer correla-
tions are developed for predicting dissolution rates of solids in steel melts.
 
3. Electrical conductivity and pH method: Mixing of two miscible liquids hav-
ing nearly the same density is studied experimentally to ascertain bath mixing. 
To this end, both electrical conductivity and pH measurement techniques have 
been applied. In these, conductivity or pH is measured at a particular location 
in the bath as a function of time, following the addition of a suitable tracer 
solution. Typically, the time taken by the tracer to homogeneously disperse in 
the system is recorded [20] on the basis of which mixing time is estimated.
 
4. Wet chemical method: Mass transfer between water and an upper phase 
liquid is investigated by measuring partitioning of an added tracer between 
the two phases. To this end, suitable wet chemical methods have been used. 
An example of this is the partitioning of benzoic acid solution (a tracer) 
between water and benzene, simulating the bulk and the upper phases, 
respectively. The objective of such experiments is to understand mass trans-
fer rates between slag and metal in steelmaking.
3.8 SOME ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES
Water modeling is reasonably reliable to investigate the hydrodynamics of steelmak-
ing operations and enjoys widespread acceptability in the steel industry. The tech-
nique has therefore been frequently applied to investigate fl uid dynamics of a BOF, 
ladle, tundish, mold, etc. A few examples are briefl y discussed below.
3.8.1  INFLUENCE OF BOTTOM TUYERE DESIGN 
ON MIXING EFFICIENCY IN A BOF
Mixing in the bulk of liquid steel in a BOF is of paramount importance. Sloping, a 
relatively high FeO content of the slag, etc. is all known to be the result of poor mixing

in top blown LD converts. Carefully designed water model studies have indicated that 
while augmenting top O2 injection with Ar bubbling from the bottom, the mixing 
effi ciency in the bulk phase is signifi cantly enhanced. Such improvement is generally 
found to be a function of the number of tuyeres and their placement at the base of a 
BOF, as has been confi rmed through many independent water model investigations.
One set of results [21] deduced from 1:5 and 1:19 scale models of a 240 ton BOF 
converter is shown in Figure 3.10. In this, the variation of mixing index* as a func-
tion of gas injection location, when six injectors are arranged as two symmetrically 
placed lines about the vessel’s axis, is shown. There, a mixing index of <1 corre-
sponds to “improved-mixing” while an index of >1 denotes a worsened situation with 
respect to top blowing. In the fi gure, two curves are shown; the lower curve refer-
ring to a combination blowing arrangement, while the upper one to a bottom blown 
situation only. It is readily apparent that mixing index for all experimental condi-
tions are less than unity indicating essentially that mixing in combination as well as 
bottom blowing confi gurations is more rapid than that in an equivalent top blowing 
system. Observations presented in Figure 3.10 also indicate that specifi c arrangement 
of tuyeres at the base of the vessel exerts signifi cant infl uence on the effi ciency of 
mixing in the system.
3.8.2 BATH HOMOGENIZATION IN CAS ALLOY ADDITION PROCEDURE
The composition adjustment by sealed argon bubbling (CAS) is an alloy addition 
procedure and is used to introduce buoyant additions such as Al, C, etc. into molten 
* This is defi ned as the ratio of mixing times in a bottom or combination blowing confi guration to that 
in top blowing.

steel. The process utilizes argon gas that is bubbled into molten steel through a 
porous plug or a submerged lance. The rising gas–liquid plume creates an open-
ing in the slag cover through which a refractory-lined cylinder (i.e., a snorkel; see 
Figure 3.11a) is lowered into the bulk steel. The essential idea is to make bulk alloy 
addition to this slag-free region so as to achieve higher and more reproducible yields 
than are possible with conventional procedures.

ing in these two systems differ widely, with the CAS exhibiting a much poorer rate of 
homogenization (i.e., about 60%–80% longer mixing times under the similar oper-
ating conditions). Improved recovery in CAS is therefore likely to get offset in the 
industry with longer mixing times necessitating prolonged treatment of steel result-
ing in greater specifi c argon consumption and an increased temperature drop.
3.8.3  ROLE OF FLOW MODIFIERS ON TUNDISH 
HYDRODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE
Tundish is the last reactor in which molten steel spends time before its entry into 
continuous casting molds. By regulating molten steel fl ow in tundish judiciously, an 
environment conducive to the removal of inclusions (~100 µm or bigger) is created 
leading to the production of clean steel. Water model trials have helped identify fl ow 
modifi er (or tundish furniture) designs that create the desired fl ow conditions, result-
ing in maximum inclusion fl oat out, negligible slag emulsifi cation and entrainment, 
minimal short circuiting, and so on. It is known that a suitably designed pouring box 
placed immediately below the shroud helps prevent short circuit fl ows completely, 
inhibit turbulence and create surface-directed fl ows that are ideally suited for the 
fl oatation of nonmetallic inclusion. Experimentally measured fl ow patterns on the 
central vertical plane of a single strand slab casting tundish with and without fl ow 
modifi ers are shown in Figure 3.12 [23]. These clearly indicate that surface-directed 
fl ows are also produced by a combination of a dam and a weir. Appropriate designs of

pouring box, dam, and weir as well as their placement in continuous casting tundish 
are all currently worked out primarily on the basis of water model trials.
3.8.4  VORTEX FORMATION AND SLAG ENTRAINMENT DURING 
EMPTYING OF METALLURGICAL VESSELS
The fi nal stage of emptying a steelmaking furnace, ladle, or tundish, etc. is accom-
panied by signifi cant slag entrainment that is known to seriously impair the 
quality of fi nal product. It is therefore prohibitive to drain the entire mass of liq-
uid steel from a reactor in order to prevent signifi cant entrainment of carry over 
slag. This is counterproductive as residual steel in a ladle or tundish reduces 
yield. Water model studies have therefore been carried out to identify operating 
conditions and designs suitable for negligible slag entrainment as well as residual 
steel loss. As illustrated in Figure 3.13 [24], the formation of a funnel vortex and 
the accompanied entrainment of the upper phase liquid in steel processing ladles 
are nicely demonstrated through water modeling. The infl uences that liquid steel 
motion, vessel design, teeming nozzle dimensions and design, etc. exert on the phe-
nomena of vortex formation are deduced from such water model trials. Optimum

vortex buster designs are also evolved through water modeling and often applied in 
the industry to reduce slag entrainment.
These examples together with many others demonstrate that reduced scale water 
modeling is an effective approach in steelmaking process analysis. Nonetheless, it 
is rather diffi cult to derive complete and precise information through water model-
ing alone, as has been pointed out already. Water modeling therefore requires rein-
forcements to be suffi ciently predictive. In such context, mathematical modeling and 
pilot-scale trials play decisive roles.
3.9 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Principles of physical modeling are discussed in this chapter and their applica-
tion to process modeling elucidated through a number of worked examples. The 
decisive advantages of using water to represent molten steel fl ows and potential 
of water modeling together with its limitations are also outlined. In addition, 
some commonly employed measurement techniques in water modeling are also 
included in the discussion together with a set of successful modeling examples. 
It is acknowledged that water modeling as an effective process analysis tool and 
enjoys widespread popularity among researchers in the steel industry as well as 
the academia.

4 Elements of 
Mathematical Modeling
4.1 INTRODUCTION
Process analysis, design, and optimization rely overwhelmingly on mathematical 
modeling. In the manufacturing industry, mathematical models play key roles in 
process control. Since high temperature, visual opacity of molten steel, and the large 
size of steel processing reactor preclude direct observation, mathematical modeling 
naturally fi nds widespread application in steelmaking. For example, mathematical 
models are routinely used to control the end-blow period accurately in steel melting 
shops. The enormous productivity of present-day steel mills is but due to widespread 
application of mathematical models on the shop fl oor. In addition, new products and 
new technologies such as thin slab and strip casting, etc. owe a great deal to math-
ematical modeling. It is envisaged that automation and dynamic control of steelmak-
ing as well as robotization of shop fl oor activities will witness even more intense 
application of mathematical modeling in the years to come.
Mathematical modeling of steelmaking is a vast subject and embodies diverse 
concepts. Process models are frequently based on the theory of rate processes, arti-
fi cial intelligence (AI), population balance, etc. Similarly, solutions of model equa-
tions encompass diverse and distinctly different methodologies. It is not possible to 
provide a comprehensive treatise of all such topics in this chapter. Excellent resource 
materials in the form of many textbooks exist [1–7] and the reader is urged to take 
advantage of this. What therefore follows in the subsequent sections is an essence of 
the mathematical modeling of steelmaking. Starting with a few defi nitions and some 
key concepts, the general philosophy of model building and present day modeling 
strategies together with the potentials and limitations of mathematical modeling are 
discussed in this chapter. Modeling of individual steelmaking processes is taken up 
later in Chapters 6 and 7 on case-by-case basis.
4.2 MATHEMATICAL MODELING IN STEELMAKING
Mathematical modeling fi nds diverse application in steelmaking and as illustrated in 
Figure 4.1 is generally used in the following areas:
 
1. Process analysis
 
2. Process design
 
3. Process optimization
 
4. Process control

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Process analysis is primarily concerned with the infl uence of various process param-
eters on the performance of any given steelmaking process. For example, through 
modeling, one can work out the consequences of an increasing argon fl ow rate on  
the complete dissolution time of ferroalloys in ladle metallurgy operations.
Mathematical models are extensively used in the design and development of new 
processes. These also fi nd frequent applications in research and are used to gain use-
ful insight into steelmaking. Application of mathematical modeling to steelmaking 
process analysis and design is indeed numerous and documented well in the literature 
on this subject. In optimization, one is concerned with operating conditions providing 
maximum benefi ts in terms of quality, cost, etc. For example, the effi ciency of mixing 
and the extent of melt reoxidation in an argon-stirred ladle increases simultaneously 
with the increase of gas fl ow rate. Reoxidation leads to aluminum fading affecting 
melt cleanliness adversely. This necessitates an optimum argon fl ow rate such that 
 maximum mixing coupled with minimal reoxidation results. In addition,  mathematical 
 models are routinely used in steelmaking process control. From basic oxygen  furnaces 
(BOFs) to rolling mills, a variety of algorithms are used to monitor, automate, and 
 control the end point in BOFs, spray cooling intensity in continuous casting,  residence 
time in reheat furnaces, roll gap in rolling mills, and so on.
From the view point of their derivation, mathematical models fall into two broad 
categories, namely,
 
1. Fundamental (or mechanistic)
 
2. Empirical
Fundamental or mechanistic models are based on basic physical and chemical laws 
such as thermodynamic equilibria, fl uid fl ow, heat transfer, mass transfer, etc. Such

models, in general, have a broad range of validity and therefore enjoy suffi cient uni-
versality. Empirical models, on the other hand, are based on observations and there-
fore applicable to specifi c situation. Accordingly, generalization of empirical models 
is by and large not possible. For example, an empirical model of ladle desulfurization 
that correlates end sulfur with an amount of melt, slag basicity, oxygen potential, etc. 
is unlikely to be applicable to all steel plants. In both the above-mentioned categories, 
further fi ner subdivisions are possible. Classifi cation also depends on the standpoints 
from which a particular model is derived. For example, empirical models described in 
Chapter 8 are based on experimental data and statistical methods. On the other hand, 
those in Chapter 9 are based on AI methods.
The level of complexity in a given problem is an important issue and helps decide 
the modeling strategy (mechanistic vs. empirical). Empirical models in general are 
advocated when a model based on fi rst principles is not forthcoming. For example, a 
rigorous theoretical estimation of a surface heat transfer coeffi cient in the spray cool-
ing zone of a continuous caster is diffi cult, if not impossible. Similarly, a fundamen-
tally based, rigorous, mathematical model for arc furnace steelmaking embodying 
heat transfer from the electrodes, incipient fusion of scrap and solid–liquid fl ows has 
not been possible till date. Our current understanding of many complex phenomena 
such as multiphase reacting fl ows, turbulence, heat and mass transfer, droplet break-
up and coalescence, phase change, etc. are far from complete. These pose consider-
able diffi culties in formulating rigorous, fundamentally based mathematical model. 
In contrast, process models for scrap and ferroalloy dissolution, material and thermal 
mixing, homogeneous turbulent fl ows, etc. are conveniently worked out from fi rst 
principles.
The preceding discussion indicates that our understanding of steelmaking at the 
fundamental level varies from one process to another. In many situations the underly-
ing physics is well understood (e.g., material and thermal mixing in tundish) and as a 
result, reasonably comprehensive mathematical model is possible. On the other hand, 
there are a host of processes (e.g., reacting multiphase fl ows in oxygen steelmaking) 
which are extremely complex, involve multiphysics, and are relatively less under-
stood. Indeed, a vast majority of steelmaking processes fall into the latter category. 
Therefore as of now, the scope of rigorous modeling in steelmaking appears to be 
somewhat limited. It is practically impossible to work out a mathematical model in 
steelmaking without empiricisms and/or idealizations. Presently therefore some ele-
ments of uncertainty exist. Nonetheless, with sustained efforts and improvements in 
our knowledge base, we will eventually develop fundamentally based, suffi ciently 
rigorous mathematical models for a vast majority of steelmaking processes. The 
present lack of rigor in many situations warrants a synergy between mathematical 
modeling and experimental measurements as careful and controlled experiments 
tend to do away with many uncertainties. Current status of modeling of various steel-
making processes is summarized in Table 4.1.

immensely to the success of mathematical modeling in steelmaking. Frequently, 
 concepts from diverse disciplines have been integrated to frame realistic process 
models for many complex phenomena. For example, while chemical and ocean 
engineering fundamentals have been integrated in the hydrodynamic models of 
 gas-stirred ladle systems [8], raindrop coalescence models form the basis of inclusion

agglomeration [9] kinetics. Mathematical modeling of steelmaking naturally entails 
major efforts and frequently involves team effort wherein mechanical,  chemical, and 
metallurgical engineers jointly play many important roles.
A vast majority of steelmaking process models are formulated on the basis of 
the laws of conservation of mass, momentum, enthalpy, mechanical energy, and 
so on. Consider, for example, prediction of superheat in a continuous casting mold 
from fi rst principles. It is at once apparent that the laws of conservation of momen-
tum and thermal energy are the key principles involved. This is so as estimation 
of convective process rates necessitates a priori knowledge of fl ow in the system. 
Construction of such a mental picture of the actual problem or conceptual model-
ing is critical in mathematical modeling. A well-defi ned objective and a thorough 
understanding of the science and technology of steelmaking are the prerequisites to 
initiate a mission-oriented modeling exercise.
Mathematical models are developed on different scales, i.e., macro, meso, micro, 
and nano, and conceptual modeling helps defi ne the scale of modeling. For example, 
Bernoulli’s mechanical energy conservation equation is a macroscale model derived 
over a domain or control volume that is comparable to the size of the system itself. 
At the other extreme, phenomena such as nucleation and growth, crystal imperfec-
tions, etc. involve modeling at the atomistic scale. Mechanistic models of steel-
making, on the other hand, are developed considering conservation of enthalpy, 
mass, momentum, energy, etc. over an infi nitesimal or microcontrol volume.* 
In such context, as a starting point, one establishes a control volume in the domain 
of interest and develops relevant “conservation equations.” Assigning appropriate 
initial and boundary conditions, one then proceeds with the manipulation and solu-
tion of the governing equations. In summary, building a mechanistic model entails
 
1. Understanding the problem at the fundamental level
 
2. Conceptual modeling
 
3. Control volume establishment and statement of the relevant laws of 
conservation
 
4. Derivation of partial differential equations (p.d.e’s) and the associated 
boundary conditions
 
5. Solution of the p.d.e’s.
4.3.1 BUILDING BLOCKS AND GOVERNING EQUATIONS
Deriving governing equations through the control volume approach is time intensive 
since steelmaking involves numerous, mutually interrelated phenomena such as fl uid 
fl ow, turbulence, heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, and so on. Computer 
coding equations for their numerical solutions compound such diffi culty further. 
Fortunately, however, it is not always required to move through these cumbersome 
steps, as help is readily available from:
* This is described in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.4.1.1, respectively.
  

144 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
 
1. Many analogous studies and precedents
 
2. A wide range of software packages
 
3. High quality, inexpensive hardwares
There has been a great deal of accumulated experience in the modeling of 
 steelmaking processes and therefore, in many cases, new solutions or efforts can 
be built on past experiences. As a starting point, it is therefore important to explore 
what similar work has been done in the context of a chosen problem. Textbook 
materials and relevant previous efforts together with a good grasp of the science 
base of steelmaking can immensely help formulating a problem mathematically. 
For example, in an effort to model solidifi cation phenomena in a continuous cast-
ing process, advantage can be taken of the large volume of literature available on 
the subject. Thus governing equations of fl ow and heat transfer need not be derived 
afresh; instead, if applicable, these can be directly adapted from previous studies 
with little or no modifi cations. If additional aspects are considered, these could also 
be built on to the applicable, existing equations. A thorough analysis nonetheless is 
desirable, before equations and boundary conditions from literature are applied in 
a straight forward manner.
A powerful tool in mathematical modeling is the commercial or public domain 
software. Available computer codes on thermodynamics, structural analysis, fl uid 
dynamics, heat and mass transfer, etc. are readily available to aid a modern day 
mathematical modeling activity. Parallel to this, ready availability of high-end 
computing machines at affordable prices has also dramatically infl uenced math-
ematical modeling. Commercial packages coupled with powerful digital computers 
allow us to carry out modeling of steelmaking processes at a remarkable speed in 
a cost-effective manner.
Generally, following problem identifi cation and conceptual modeling is a liter-
ature search for similar types of investigations. Prior knowledge in the area often 
constitutes the required base and very frequently, a decision follows that what is 
needed in modeling is indeed an incremental effort. Subsequently, the individual 
components or building blocks (viz., fl uid dynamics, turbulence, MHD, and so on) are 
pulled from the basic technical literature and assembled to represent the mathematical 
model. A summary of various building blocks [10] applied frequently to mathemati-
cal modeling of steelmaking is presented in Table 4.2 together with their applica-
tion area. Characteristic equations for each building block are shown in Table 4.3. 
Specifi c extended forms of these equations are described on a case to case basis later 
in Chapters 5 through 7. Model building often extends beyond governing equations as 
boundary conditions and constitutive relationships are needed to complete the task.
4.3.2 BOUNDARY TYPES AND CONDITIONS
Formulating adequate numbers of initial and boundary conditions is an important 
and integral aspect of mathematical model development. The p.d.e’s together with 
the initial and boundary conditions complete the mathematical statement. While 
governing equations are phenomena specifi c, the initial and boundary conditions, 
on the other hand, are problem specifi c and therefore vary from one problem to 
  

Elements of Mathematical Modeling

another. For example, steady turbulent fl ows in cylindrical-shaped ladles and cir-
cular cross-section pipes are described essentially via the same set of p.d.e’s, but 
the fl ow geometry and the associated boundary conditions differ signifi cantly. 
These therefore result in markedly different fl ow profi les (in terms of magnitude 
and direction) in the two systems. It is of paramount importance that initial and 
boundary conditions are formulated and prescribed as realistically as possible. 
Two issues assume importance in such context; these are the total number of ini-
tial and boundary conditions as well as their specifi c mathematical formulation.
Initial and boundary conditions are prescribed on the dependent variables such 
as velocity, temperature, etc. in terms of a set of independent variables, i.e., x, y, z, 
and t. The required number of conditions on a dependent variable is determined from 
the characteristic conservation equation noting the order of the largest derivatives. 
Consider, for example, the conservation of axial momentum in a three-dimensional 
(3D) fl ow represented via

in which the axial velocity, vx, is the dependent variable while x, y, z, and t are 
the independent variables. The above p.d.e,* as seen, involves a fi rst-order derivate 
on time, t, as well as a fi rst and a second-order derivative each along the three coor-
dinate axes x, y, and z, respectively. Since the order of the highest derivative along 
a coordinate axis defi nes the corresponding number of conditions,† it is therefore at 
once evident that one initial (in terms of t) and six boundary conditions (two each 
on x, y, and z) are required on the dependent variable vx to defi ne Equation 4.1 com-
pletely. For the sake of better elucidation, this is worked out in Table 4.4.
An initial condition corresponds to the solution of the differential equation at time 
t = 0 and is assumed to be known. For example, temperature distribution within a 
solid slab at the moment of its insertion into a reheat furnace is a logical initial condi-
tion for computation of a thermal fi eld at all subsequent times. In a vast majority of 
problems, the initial condition is generally prescribed in a straight forward manner. 
Experimental measurements or results from a separate modeling exercise could also 
be applied to formulate the initial condition, if needed.
Boundary conditions depend on the nature of the physical boundaries. The fol-
lowing six different possibilities exist in steelmaking.
 
1. Wall (stationary or moving)
 
2. Axis
 
3. Free surface
 
4. Velocity or mass fl ow inlet
 
5. Outlet or outfl ow
 
6. Interface
*  Given the pressure distribution, gravity and the two other velocity components, vy and vz, Equation 4.1 
represents a well-posed problem involving a system of one unknown and one equation.
†  The highest order derivative, say in an ordinary differential equation, determines the required number of 
constants of integration. The number of boundary conditions required is evidently hidden in the order 
of the derivatives.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
These are illustrated in Figure 4.2. Refi ning vessels are typically bounded by solid 
walls from fi ve sides which are essentially stationary. During transfer operations, 
however, i.e., tapping, the furnace no longer remains stationary and is moved at 
a predetermined rate. A symmetry axis or plane of symmetry could be identi-
fi ed in many fl ow situations such as the one depicted in Figure 4.2a. Similarly, in 
continuous casting of steel, a plane of symmetry exists, that divides a slab/bloom 
or billet caster mold into two identical halves. Molten steel generally occupies a 
portion of the vessel in which a free surface separates the melt from the ambi-
ent. A free surface is invariably present practically at every stage of steelmaking. 
Furthermore, fl ow inlets and outlets are also encountered sometimes in steelmak-
ing. For example, in tundish operations, steel fl ows into the tundish through a 
shroud and leaves via one or more strands. This is shown in Figure 4.2b. Finally, 
in many problems particularly those consisting of several phases, one encounters 
a well-defi ned interface such as the one shown in Figure 4.2c. There, shell–alloy 
and shell–molten steel interfaces are readily apparent. At all such boundaries,

information on the dependent variable or its gradient is required. These are 
discussed in the following paragraphs with specifi c reference to the transport of 
momentum, mass, and heat.
Wall: On solid walls, a “no-slip” condition is typically applied. This implies that 
fl uid in contact with a stationary wall remains stationary or moves with the same 
rate as a moving wall. Such considerations are based on the assumption that melt 
completely wets the solid wall. In situations where wettability is an issue, there may 
be some uncertainty while invoking the “no-slip” assumption. At a moving wall, a 
prescribed shear stress (proportional to velocity gradient), if available, can also be 
applied instead of velocity.
Through impervious solid walls, no material fl ow is possible. This necessitates a 
zero mass fl ux through the wall. Since normal velocity to a wall is set to zero, ensuring 
a zero gradient at the wall automatically ensures a zero net fl ux (i.e., convection + 
diffusion) through the wall.
Unlike material, heat fl ows to the ambient at a fi nite rate through the vessel walls 
and, as a matter of fact, through practically all the system boundaries. Rigorous 
estimate of heat loss is diffi cult. Therefore, empirically determined heat fl ux (i.e., 
proportional to the gradient of temperature) or temperature is generally prescribed at 
the walls. Without such empirical inputs, modeling of thermal fi elds in steelmaking 
systems is diffi cult.
Axis: A symmetry axis or a plane of symmetry naturally exists in symmetrical 
geometries and operating practices. Axis is common to a two-dimensional (2-D) 
or an axisymmetrical situation and a plane of symmetry to a 3-D situation. A sym-
metry axis or plane does not constitute an actual physical boundary. Yet, it is often 
convenient to prescribe boundary conditions there as dependant variables exhibit 
symmetry around such a line or plane. By defi nition, momentum, mass, energy, etc. 
cannot pass through the symmetry axis or plane, and hence their respective fl ux 
through such a boundary is always zero. This is accomplished by setting convection 
(i.e., the fl ow component normal to the symmetry axis/plane) and diffusion across 
such boundaries to zero.
Free surface: A free surface, separating a liquid (melt or slag) from the ambient 
is frequently encountered in steelmaking. However, the contour of such a surface 
is not known a priori. In many situations, the free surface is idealized as a fl at, 
mobile surface and is associated with fi nite tangential velocities only. Alternatively, 
the free surface shape is calculated say, from a height function method as described 
in Section 6.7.3. A negligible shear is generally assumed to be transmitted (due to 
a large difference in viscosity between the liquid and the ambient) across the free 
surface. This implies zero tangential velocity gradients. Equivalent condition on the 
normal fl ow component is prescribed depending on whether the free surface shape 
is calculated or imposed a priori. A fl at, free surface is associated with zero normal 
velocity and is at times treated mathematically as a hypothetical, rigid wall with zero 
shear. Alternatively, boundary conditions at the free surface can also be prescribed 
in terms of pressure rather than velocity. This is convenient since a vast majority of 
steelmaking operations are carried out at normal atmospheric pressure. While mate-
rial fl ux is typically zero, a fi nite heat fl ux (i.e., determined empirically) applies to a 
free surface boundary.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Inlet: The values of all the dependent variables must be known at the fl ow inlet and 
prescribed as accurately as possible. Individual fl ow components, temperature of the 
incoming fl uid, mass fraction of a species, turbulence kinetic energy of the incoming 
fl uid, etc. are all therefore required at the fl ow inlet. These are generally known from 
measurements and assumed to prevail uniformly across the cross-section of the fl ow 
inlet.
Outlet: Boundary conditions at an inlet are generally known, but the same is not true of 
an outlet where knowledge of dependent variables does not normally exist. Conditions 
at an outlet are therefore formulated on the basis of idealizations and approximations. 
In one of the procedures, locally one-dimensional (1-D) fl ow is assumed to prevail at 
the outfl ow.* All elliptic equations there are treated as locally parabolic and thus, no 
information on the dependent variables is required in the formalism. In addition, the 
overall continuity is ensured at the outfl ow boundary. Similar to a fl ow inlet, boundary 
conditions at an outlet can also be prescribed in terms of a known pressure fi eld.
Interface: Continuity of momentum, mass, and heat has to be satisfi ed at an interface 
between two phases. This implies that the rate at which momentum, mass, and energy 
leave one phase is exactly identical to the rate at which these enter the other. At a 
rigid solid, inert interface, while wall conditions (i.e., zero fl ux) generally apply to 
momentum and mass, interfacial contact resistances are required to express the conti-
nuity of heat. For example, molten steel, solid refractory and the steel shell† comprise 
a typical domain through which heat in actual practice fl ows to the ambient. Contact 
resistances at various interfaces are needed to mathematically model temperature 
distribution in such a composite domain.
Boundary conditions in their appropriate mathematical forms are presented 
and discussed in Chapters 5 through 7 with reference to the modeling of specifi c 
steelmaking problems.
4.3.3 HARDWARE
Computers and computational software are the key elements of any present-day 
process modeling endeavor. These infl uence both speed and cost and therefore 
determine effectiveness of any model study program. In recent years, there have 
been major developments regarding computing hardware. Firstly, the speed of com-
putation has increased remarkably over the years. Secondly, the cost of calcula-
tions and the hardware itself has dropped down signifi cantly and continuously over 
the last few decades. With many reliable software having diverse computational 
capabilities available in the market place, it is now possible to carry out process 
modeling at the industrial scale at a remarkable speed and cost-effective manner. 
In many instances, simulation in real time is also possible.
A wide range of hardware is available in the market. Owing to rapid developments, 
the sharp line of division among these is gradually becoming less well-defi ned. In 
Table 4.5 hardware is listed for three principal categories and in two different time 
periods to show the extent of price reduction during the same period. “Workstation” 
* This is ensured by prescribing a large Peclet number at the outlet.

capabilities available in the 1990s are now common in personal computers and 
available at a much lower price. Even mobile workstations are becoming increasingly 
available at an affordable price. Thus, speed of calculations which were typically 
in the range of several thousand fl oating point operations per second (FLOPS) in 
the 1980s, now readily available in terafl op (= 103 kfl op). Similarly, during the same 
period the cost of memory/storage has also come down signifi cantly from several 
hundreds of dollars per megabytes (MB) to a few dollars per gigabytes (GB). Such 
trends are clearly visible in Figure 4.3a and b. It is to be noted that high-end work sta-
tions, large main frames, and supercomputers are generally needed for the effective, 
industrial-scale simulation of steelmaking processes.
4.3.4 SOFTWARE
The speed at which a process simulation is carried out has assumed tremendous sig-
nifi cance in the present time. Considerable benefi ts are likely if available commer-
cial software is adapted to model steelmaking processes. Indeed, ready availability 
of highly effi cient, versatile, and user-friendly software to perform numerous com-
putational tasks has made the life of a present-day modeler much easier. Such com-
mercial packages coupled with powerful digital computers provide hope that a large 
variety of practical problems of interest can now be modeled effectively in a reasonable 
time frame. Thus many undue simplifi cations (e.g., 2-D, isothermal, single phase, etc.) 
which were common in the 1980s can now be easily dispensed with providing oppor-
tunity for more exhaustive simulation of steelmaking processes. A list of commercial 
software packages of relevance to the modeling of steelmaking is presented in Table 
4.6. Their application area as such is diverse and encompasses a variety of physics such 
as, phase equilibria, transport phenomena, solid mechanics, and so on. These highest 
performance codes running on highest performance hardware currently allow us to 
predict a given phenomenon at a remarkable speed. Indeed, algorithms underlying 
mathematical modeling have improved at a rate even greater than the hardware and

this is shown in Figure 4.4 [11], in which the rate of increase of processing performance 
of various algorithms with respect to the classical Gaussian elimination (GE) method 
is presented on a quantitative scale. To illustrate this point further, fi rsthand experi-
ence with the modeling of a benchmark problem via software developed in-house and 
a commercial software package is summarized in Table 4.7. There, relative efforts 
in model development, problem implementation, postprocessing, etc. evidently justify 
increasing present-day reliance on commercial software. Interactive and effi cient mesh 
generation, high performance solvers, and elegant postprocessing make such user-
friendly software extremely useful to the modeling of steelmaking processes.
To illustrate the role of commercial computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) packages 
in steelmaking process modeling, progress in mathematical modeling of Ar/N2-stirred 
ladle is summarized in Table 4.8. Thus, nearly three decades ago, while gas-stirred 
ladles were primarily modeled as an axisymmetrical, steady, pseudo-single phase 
system, currently fully transient, 3-D, multiphase (gas–slag and metal) simulations 
are frequent. Thanks to commercial software as these allow modeling of steelmaking 
far more effectively than was possible earlier.

4.3.5 COST COMPONENTS AND MODELING STRATEGY
The cost of hardware and software together with those associated with manpower 
determines the net fi nancial load of a modeling endeavor. While a reasonable com-
bined cost of hardware and software could amount to only several thousand dollars 
per investigation, the severity of modeling, by and large, determines the extent of 
manpower involvement and hence the associated cost. For simple problems while 
efforts may range up to a few man months, modeling of industrially relevant, chal-
lenging problems can be signifi cantly more involved. Formulation of the problem, 
implementation in commercial software, execution and analyses together with physi-
cal modeling and pilot-scale trials which are generally required for a meaningful 
outcome, are time intensive. Looked at from such a standpoint, any realistic model-
ing effort is likely to embody a much bigger cost than is afforded by the software and

hardware combined. Yet, considering the annual turnover rates of moderately sized 
steel plants (>102–103 million dollars), the gross fi nancial load of a modeling exercise 
is likely to be insignifi cant. Past experiences show that in a majority of situations, the 
benefi ts derived from model investigation outweighs such cost.
Since the days of Sir Henry Bessemer, the fi eld of steelmaking has witnessed 
remarkable developments and phenomenal growth. Future endeavors are expected 
to be primarily concerned with:
 
1. Consistent and superior product quality (i.e., less inclusions, less defects in 
fi nal products, and so on).
 
2. Reduction in specifi c energy consumption (i.e., better operation through 
process control and automation and developments of new technology and 
products as well as improvement of existing technology).
 
3. Zero emission coupled with effi cient waste disposal and recycling (i.e., 
reduction of slag volume, effi cient utilization and disposal of off-gases and 
by-products, etc. leading to ecofriendly, green steelmaking).
 
4. Better safety at the work place (i.e., removal of hazardous working condi-
tions through streamlined operation and robotization).
On all such fronts, modeling is expected to play a pivotal role. The general modeling 
strategy [10] and a corresponding specifi c example are presented in Figure 4.5. There, 
experimental measurement is shown as an essential companion to mathematical

model study program. Experimental data are required for testing the appropriate-
ness of a mathematical model and are derived from physical models, pilot or full-
scale steel processing units. Some experimental back up is highly desirable owing to 
many associated uncertainties pointed out already. The relative proportion of the two 
ingredients, experiment vs. computation, depends on the specifi c nature of the prob-
lem, objectives of prediction and economic and other related constraints. A judicial 
blend of prediction and measurement is pivotal to the entire exercise and determines 
largely the success (i.e., meeting the end objectives) of any modeling endeavor.
4.4 NUMERICAL SOLUTION
Building blocks, their components, and characteristic equations summarized in 
Tables 4.2 and 4.3 indicate that governing equations are complex (i.e., multidimen-
sional, coupled, nonlinear, and so on) and are therefore not amenable to analytical 
methods of solutions in the context of modeling of steelmaking processes. Numerical 
methods and computers are therefore required. It is instructive to note here that with 
the governing equations identifi ed and the appropriate set of initial and boundary 
conditions defi ned, the statement of a problem is complete. This implies that a solu-
tion in principle can be worked out.
Numerical methods encompass a vast area and books, journals, and monographs 
dealing with the subject are abundant. Indeed, texts, dealing with the solution of 
differential equations in general and transport type equations in particular, are also 
numerous. During their early undergraduate years, metallurgical and materials engi-
neers are exposed to numerical methods in reasonable detail. In the following section, 
this is very briefl y revisited. More elaborate treatment is available in Refs. [5–7].
It is worthwhile to begin a discussion on the subject by fi rst examining the general 
nature of the p.d.e’s presented in Table 4.3. Consider, for example, the conservation 
of thermal energy expressed in compact tensorial notation as

Steelmaking reactors are 3-D with length scales comparable in each direction. 
Simplifi cation of geometry is therefore, rarely possible. Governing equations of 
momentum, mass, thermal energy transport, etc. are in general nonlinear. The non-
linearity in the above example is due to a temperature-dependent thermal conduc-
tivity as well as a heat source taken to be a function of the dependent variable, T. 
Therefore, neither the thermal conductivity nor the source term is known a priori. 
These tend to complicate the solution of Equation 4.3 further. Equation 4.3 does 
not have a one-way space coordinate (i.e., no preferential direction of heat fl ow: 
convective and diffusive transports are both important along each coordinate 
axis). Indeed, the so-called boundary layer or parabolic fl ow approximations (i.e.,

 are rarely applicable in modeling of steelmaking. 
A marching solution therefore is not possible along any space direction.* In addition, 
the thermal energy conservation is interlinked with the distribution of fl ow, i.e., the 
fl ow of heat is coupled with the fl ow of fl uid. At times, it is also possible that the fl ow 
itself depends on the temperature distribution, as with thermal natural convection 
(these are respectively referred to as one-way and mutually coupled phenomena). 
Hence, mathematical models in steelmaking are expected to be complex and their 
solution is likely to entail signifi cant efforts.
The various building blocks and their constituents summarized in Table 4.3 
indicate a certain commonality between conservation equations. For example, 
mass conservation of a species, i, in a fl ow, represented in the Cartesian coordinate 
system, i.e.,

is very similar to the thermal energy conservation equation presented earlier. These 
as seen embody the convective terms (associated with the fl ows) such as the dif-
fusive terms (associated with the diffusion coeffi cient), the source term (i.e., either 
generation or destruction), and the accumulation or the unsteady term. Equation 4.1 
presented earlier can also be readily manipulated and cast in the above format. We 
may therefore consider various conservation equations of interest here to be com-
prised of the unsteady, the convective, the diffusive, and the source terms. Given 
that, the continuity, momentum conservation, thermal energy and turbulence kinetic 
energy conservation equations, etc. can all be generalized in terms of the following 
characteristic differential equation expressing the conservation of a general variable 
ϕ in the Cartesian coordinate system as
* Time, for example, is a one-way coordinate along which a marching solution (from an initial given 
state to all subsequent times) is possible. Fluid fl ow at times can make space (a two-way coordinate) 
behave as a one-way coordinate.

in which Γ is the general diffusion coeffi cient and Sϕ is the generalized source 
term. For example, we can consider the continuity equation (i.e., Equation 2.29) 
as a special case of Equation 4.6 by setting the diffusion coeffi cient and the 
source term to zero together with ϕ = 1. We can arrive at similar conclusions 
for many physical phenomena and this is demonstrated in Worked Example 4.1. 
That all relevant differential equations of interest can be thought of as a particu-
lar case of Equation 4.6 is an important time-saving step as far as the solution 
of differential equations and their computer coding are concerned. Consequently, 
we need to concern ourselves with the solution of only one equation, i.e., 
Equation 4.6. The same solution procedure can be conveniently extended to all 
dependent variable of interest by assigning suitable meaning to ϕ, Γ, Sϕ, etc. 
A single robust computational procedure therefore suffi ces modeling of a host of 
different phenomena.

The above example demonstrates explicitly how a given p.d.e is recast in the general-

A numerical method transforms a differential equation into an algebraic one.

in which ∆x represents spacing between two successive points. Algebraic approxi-
mations of derivatives are by no means unique and vary with numerical methods 
which embody diverse concepts. Consequently, different versions of algebraic equa-
tions result from the same p.d.e. Also, efforts required to solve a differential equation 
generally vary with numerical method. There are many classes of numerical meth-
ods that in principle can be applied to work out the implications of an ordinary or a 
p.d.e viz.,
 
1. Taylor series-based formulation.
 
2. Variational formulation.
 
3. Method of weighted residual, etc.
Finite differences, fi nite elements, Galerkin methods, etc. fall in the later class. 
Many fi ner subdivisions exist in each category with or without some elements of

embodies many features that are common to both traditional fi nite difference and 
fi nite element calculation procedures.
The differential equations are continuous in nature. However, in the process of their 
conversion to equivalent algebraic expressions, we are obligated to employ a discontinu-
ous representation. This is so as we elect to constitute the solution with a limited number 
of values of the dependent variables. Depending on the number of values of the depen-
dent variables required as a part of the solution, many numbers of algebraic equations 
are derived from the governing differential equation via a numerical method. A suitable 
method is subsequently applied to solve the resultant set of algebraic equations.
To summarize, a numerical method treats as its basic unknowns the values of the 
dependent variable at a fi nite number of locations in the calculation domain, termed 
as the grid or the nodal points. The method includes the task of deriving a set of 
algebraic equations for these unknowns and prescribing an algorithm for solving the 
resultant algebraic equations. The algebraic equations are generally linearized and 
solved via one of the many available high performance solvers (i.e., algebraic multi-
grid, conjugate gradients, geometric multigrid, etc.).
Flow calculations are an integral part of steelmaking process modeling. 
Consequently, it is important to make a few specifi c points regarding the numerical 
solution of equations of continuity and motion. In fl ow modeling, the velocity and 
pressure fi elds are generally calculated simultaneously. Pressure appears as an 
explicit variable, but there is no formal equation for pressure in the fl ow model. The 
pressure fi eld is only implicitly specifi ed via the continuity equation. A correct pres-
sure fi eld substituted in the momentum conservation equations produces fl ow that 
exactly satisfi es overall continuity or mass fl ow. In other words, given the pressure 
fi eld, the information contained in the continuity equation* becomes irrelevant. This 
is however rarely the case and in a majority of fl ow modeling studies, the pressure 
fi eld is calculated as a part of the over all solution. In the absence of a direct equation 
for pressure, how is this accomplished?
An algebraic equation of pressure is formulated via the continuity equa-
tion embodying one of the many available “pressure discretization formalisms.” 
Mathematical modeling of fl ow in steelmaking involves simultaneous calculation of 
the pressure fi eld (through the solution of the pressure correction equation or pres-
sure Poisson equation) and relevant momentum conservation equations. Extensive 
discussion of these is available in Refs. [7,12].
The conservation equations presented earlier are generally nonlinear. Nonlinearity 
is handled in most of the numerical frameworks through “iteration.” An iterative 
solution technique fi ts very well with the available methods of solution of simultane-
ous linear algebraic equations. Thus, following domain discretization, derivation of 
algebraic equations, etc., an iterative solution scheme is usually adapted to compute 
the distribution of the dependent variables. For example, in order to calculate tem-
perature distribution in a stationary medium, i.e., a heat conduction phenomenon  
with a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and heat source, one can envis-
age an iterative solution scheme involving the following sequence of operations:
* The stream function ~ vorticity-based formulation for 2-D fl ows exploits this and judiciously avoids 
calculation of pressure fi eld.
  

Elements of Mathematical Modeling 
161
Step I: Guess a temperature distribution to initiate the calculation. The guess values 
may be arbitrary or equal to a boundary or initial temperature.
Step II: Calculate thermal conductivity and source term from the given K (T) and 
ST (T) functions on the basis of the guessed temperature fi eld. Heat conduction phe-
nomenon is now rendered equivalent to the one with known thermal conductivity 
and heat source.
Step III: Solve algebraic equations to obtain a tentative distribution of temperature 
in the domain of interest.
Step IV: With the calculated temperatures as improved guess, return to step II 
and repeat subsequent steps until further repetitions (called “iterations”) cease to 
produce any signifi cant change in the value of the dependent variable, T.
The fi nal unchanged state of a solution is the “converged solution.” It is not entirely 
unlikely that successive iteration would never converge to a solution. The process 
which is the opposite of convergence is called divergence. A robust numerical method 
must have adequate features to minimize the occurrence of divergence. Divergence 
is avoided by adapting specifi c numerical techniques such as under relaxation. Many 
iterative calculation schemes are described later in Chapters 5 through 7. In Worked 
Example 4.2, a simple example is taken up to elucidate the general philosophy of 
numerical solution of a differential equation.*

subject to the following boundary conditions: (1) x = 0, T = T0, and (2) x = L, 
T = TL.
For the sake of convenience, let us arbitrarily assign K = 1, ST = −1, T0 = 0, and 
TL = 1.0 and set the domain length to 1.0 in appropriate units. With such prescription,

*  We have, for the sake of simplicity, deliberately chosen a diffusion problem. Numerical treatment of 
convection terms as well as fl ows is considerably complex and embodies many principles that are diffi -
cult to introduce through such a concise discussion. The reader is urged to refer to Ref. [7] and discover 
the fascinating world of computational fl uid dynamics.
† Note that this is a special case of the general differential equation with ρ = 0, U→= 0, Γ = K, and Sϕ = ST  .
  

162 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
In contrast to the above, we seek values of the dependent variable at selected loca-
tions in a numerical solution. Let these be the fi ve different locations within the 1-D 
domain as shown in Figure 4.6. We indicate each location with a point, mark these as 
1, 2, 3…, etc. and associate them with nonoverlapping control volumes having their 
characteristic temperatures T1, T2, …, etc.
To estimate the fi ve unknown temperatures, T1, T2, etc., fi ve equations are needed: 
one each for the fi ve nodal or grid points. To derive these, the differential equation can 
be transformed into its approximate algebraic form embodying one of the many avail-
able numerical procedures. Adapting a control volume-based fi nite difference proce-
dure, a set of fi ve characteristics algebraic equations can be derived by integrating the 
governing equation around all such control volumes surrounding the grid points. For 
example, integrating the governing equation around point 3 between x3 and x4 yields

Furthermore, assuming (1) temperature varies linearly with x, (2) source term ST

* It is certainly possible to invoke altogether different assumptions and derive the algebraic equations.
†  Grid layout and profi le assumptions are by no means unique and can vary widely. Accordingly, these 
lead to algebraic equations with altogether different coeffi cients. For example, if grid points were 
placed nonuniformly or a parabolic relationship were assumed between T and x, the coeffi cients of 
T2, T3, etc. would have been markedly different. Furthermore, it is not required to assume similar pro-
fi les for different entities, e.g., while derivatives are generally approximated from a linear function, the 
source term ST on the other hand from a step function. The consequences of such differences tend to 
fade out as one eventually seeks a practical grid independent solution by refi ning the numerical grid.

These are solved in a straight forward manner through a linear algebraic equation 
solver such as the GE technique. Solution yields T1 = 0.055, T2 = 0.195, T3 = 0.375, 
T4 = 0.56, and T5 = 0.85. Despite the assumption of a linear profi le (the actual tem-
perature profi le is quadratic), it is interesting to note that analytical and numerical 
estimates of temperature are practically equivalent!
4.5 UNCERTAINTIES IN MATHEMATICAL MODELING
The governing equations and their numerical solution both infl uence the fi nal out-
come of a model study program. Thus, a perfectly satisfactory numerical technique 
can produce worthless results if an inadequate mathematical model is applied and 
vice versa. As pointed out earlier, for many steelmaking processes, adequate math-
ematical descriptions either do not exist or are written at the expense of gross sim-
plifi cations.* Therefore, some uncertainties are imminent as far as prediction from 
mathematical models is concerned. These are generally attributed to the following:
 
1. Undue simplifi cations to governing equations i.e., gross idealization of 
interphase exchanges of heat, mass, and momentum
 
2. Approximations in initial and boundary conditions
 
3. Nonavailability of transport coeffi cients such as viscosity, thermal conductiv-
ity, diffusion coeffi cient, etc. over the range of temperature and composition 
of interest
 
4. Scarcity of high-temperature reaction kinetic data
 
5. Numerical errors
Empirically determined wall heat fl ux, drag coeffi cient, etc. from idealized situ-
ations are often applied to model steelmaking processes. For example, single 
particle spherical drag laws are frequently applied to model gas injection operation 
in steelmaking. It is unlikely that for every problem of interest, suffi ciently reliable 
thermodynamic, kinetic, and physical property data are available across the ranges of 
*  An adequate description here implies a frame work that embodies only a few reasonable assumptions 
or idealizations capable of producing suffi ciently accurate results. Mathematical models for steelmak-
ing processes are unlikely to be exact. Realistic assumptions are the key to successful modeling in 
many situations.
  

164 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
temperature and composition of interest. Scarcity of reliable high-temperature data 
poses considerable diffi culties in modeling of steelmaking processes. Furthermore, 
experimentally measured parameters themselves are not free from errors, and hence 
their incorporation into a mathematical model infl uences reliability of prediction. 
Undue idealizations, which hitherto are inherent in high temperature process modeling, 
appear to be one of the primary sources of uncertainty in model predictions.
In addition to the above, predictions are prone to numerical errors and uncer-
tainties. Accuracy of predictions, for example, depends on the following:
 
1. Numerical approximations and rounding off operations
 
2. Numerical grid and time step size
 
3. Convergence criterion
Various approximations are applied to transform a differential equation to its 
algebraic counterpart. These commonly include locally 1-D behavior, interpolation, 
a preassumed profi le, etc. which tend to infl uence the fi nal outcome. Thus two dif-
ferent numerical methods are unlikely to produce the same results for any given 
problem. In addition, the nature and distribution of grid as well as time step size 
infl uence predictions by either diminishing or amplifying uncertainties that are due 
to numerical approximations. Finally, the accuracy of predicted results is a function 
of the state of convergence. This is indicative of how closely the numerical solution 
corresponds to the true solution of the differential equation.
Despite physically realistic models and versatile, user friendly and highly effi cient 
software, errors, and uncertainties in model predictions cannot be entirely avoided. 
It is therefore desirable to assess the reliability of mathematical model predictions 
before carrying out elaborate process analysis and design calculations. Physical and 
mathematical modeling is therefore applied very often in conjunction to assess the 
reliability of numerical calculations since high-temperature experimentation is dif-
fi cult and cumbersome. Some companion measurements in industrial size reactors 
and pilot-scale vessels are also required particularly if results are to be extrapolated 
to the shop fl oor. Duly validated models alone form the right basis for industrial 
design and optimization.
4.6 COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE
Chemically reacting, multiphase turbulent fl ows, heat, and mass transfer, etc. are char-
acteristics of steelmaking. Mathematical modeling of steelmaking is therefore invariably 
complex and entails major efforts. Operations like computer coding, numerical com-
putation, and postprocessing, in general involve many man months and are time inten-
sive. To these ends, highly effi cient, robust and user friendly commercial software offers 
the much needed platform and help minimize both cost and efforts associated with any 
mathematical model study program. Therefore reliance on commercial software in the 
present time has been widespread in every engineering discipline and steelmaking is no 
exception. A list of popular engineering software with their application area is presented 
in Table 4.6. Due to our personal familiarity, we provide a brief overview of Fluent® [19] 
and COMSOL® [20] in the following.
  

Elements of Mathematical Modeling

4.6.1 FLUENT*
Fluent is a fi nite volume-based CFD platform and works on an unstructured mesh. 
It has multifaceted capabilities including fl uid fl ow, heat transfer, multiphase fl ow, 
MHD, acoustics, and so on. In this, solutions of the governing p.d.e’s describing 
the conservation of momentum, mass, heat, etc. are initiated by defi ning the fl ow 
geometry and creating the numerical grid therein. Geometry and mesh building are 
accomplished in the GAMBIT (a preprocessor to Fluent), while actual solution of 
the governing p.d.e’s is carried out in the Fluent. Provisions for import of geometry, 
created elsewhere, also exist via a friendly interface.
Operations in GAMBIT† (geometry and mesh building interactive tool) include 
the following
 
1. Creation of geometry
 
2. Building the mesh
 
3. Selection of the solver
 
4. Declaration of various surfaces and continuum
 
5. Exporting the mesh fi le to Fluent
These operations are accomplished through a highly versatile GUI. The calculation 
domain is created using certain basic tools available in GAMBIT. Starting with a 
vertex, edge, or a face and using operation as rotation, translation, sweep, bullion, etc. 
a fairly broad range of complex geometry is created. Steelmaking reactors are much 
simpler in shape say, in comparison with that of an auto engine. GAMBIT is generally 
adequate to our needs and helps build geometries of interest without much effort.
GAMBIT has the capability to create an unstructured mesh in the fl ow domain 
suitable ideally for irregular and complex fl ow geometries. Several types of mesh 
elements can be created (i.e., rectangular/triangular for a face and hexahedral/tetra-
hedral for a volume) via the available mesh building schemes which are numerous. 
Many advanced features are available in GAMBIT and these allow one to manipulate 
the mesh further (viz., boundary layer meshing, smoothening of mesh faces, healing 
and repair, reducing skewness factor, etc.) for improved numerical performance.
Following geometry and mesh building, the desired version of the solver is picked 
up from a drop-down list. Subsequently, the nature of various boundaries, i.e., sur-
faces (for a 3-D problem) or edges (for a 2-D problem) and continuum are prescribed. 
A reasonably exhaustive list of boundary types, relevant to engineering fl ow problems 
(i.e., wall, axis, free surface, velocity inlet, outlet, and so on), is available in GAMBIT. 
The GAMBIT fi le is fi nally exported to Fluent as a *.msh fi le for further processing.
A session in Fluent starts by selecting the desired version i.e., 2-D or 3-D. The 
exported mesh fi le from GAMBIT is fi rst read and as a matter of routine, inter-
nal consistency is tested. A series of declarations are subsequently made to confi g-
ure the fl ow problem. This is initiated through the drop-down list available under 
the main menu “Defi ne.” The various options available there guide the modeler to

166 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
confi gure and implement the given problem in Fluent. A thorough understanding of 
the  problem is however required to accomplish the task.
The characteristics of the solver are confi gured fi rst depending on the nature of 
the problem at hand (i.e., steady or unsteady, 2-D plain or axisymmetrical, etc.). 
Desired solution methodology (coupled vs. segregated solver, explicit vs. implicit 
formulation, and so on) can be selected or alternatively, default selections retained. 
The applicable Navier–Stokes equations and their broad solution methodology 
are thus selected. Subsequently, additional models are incorporated into the calcula-
tion scheme depending on the nature of the problem. For example, one has the option 
to carry out laminar or turbulent fl ow simulation by selecting the correct option from 
the “Viscous” module available under the main menu Defi ne. Similarly, to carry out 
thermal calculations, the “Energy” module is enabled. Numerous additional capa-
bilities such as multiphase fl ow, dispersed phase fl ow, species transport, population 
balance, acoustics, etc. are also available under the main menu “Defi ne” and cater to 
a variety of complex engineering problems. One can further augment and enhance 
modeling capabilities and carry out a tailor made simulation through user defi ned 
functions (UDF).
Fluent has a reasonably large database on engineering materials and this is avail-
able in the “Materials” panel available under the main menu “Defi ne”. If necessary, 
one can also input desired material properties. The operating and boundary conditions 
are fi nally prescribed to complete the statement of the problem. Subsequent to these, 
numerical control parameters are selected from the main menu “Solve.” There, fl ux 
calculation schemes, pressure algorithm, under relaxation parameters, convergence 
criteria, etc. are prescribed. Alternatively, one can employ the set of default prescrip-
tions. Facility for creation of several types of “Monitors” also exists to visualize the 
progress of numerical calculation. Initialization and iteration are the fi nal steps. An 
iterative solution is initiated by declaring the maximum number of iterations, time-step 
size, and maximum number of time steps via the “Iterate” panel available under the 
main menu “Solve.” The basic program structure is shown in Figure 4.7
Fluent has excellent postprocessing capabilities that allow for scientifi c visu-
alization of results, calculation of many derived entities, and so on. In addition, 
many advanced features intended primarily for complex and challenging fl ow prob-
lems are available under the two additional main menus “Adapt” and “Surfaces,” 
respectively.
4.6.2 COMSOL
This is a fi nite-element-based commercial software package capable of model-
ing cross discipline as well as single physics applications. Beyond traditional sub-
jects (i.e., acoustics, fl uid fl ow, heat and mass transfer, etc.), COMSOL* provides a 
computational platform to many emerging areas such as alternative energy source, 
biotechnology, MEMS, nanotechnology, optoelectronics, and so on. COMSOL, 
based on p.d.e’s, transforms any coupled p.d.e into a form suitable for numerical

analysis and solves the resulting equations using fi nite element method via a high-
performance solver. The software is able to freely link arbitrarily coupled processes 
into one simulation, providing practically unlimited multiphysics capability.
A geometry is created in COMSOL through the built-in CAD tools. Alternatively, 
assemblies and designs can be imported. There is a NASTRAN mesh import facility 
available in the code together with facilities for geometry healing and repair. Mesh 
generation is an automated process and in combination with easy-to-use interac-
tive meshing techniques, it offers much fl exibility in which edge, surface, and vol-
ume meshes can be independently controlled. Modeling and overall settings such 
as space, dimension, physics, unit system, graphic interface language, and so on are 
controlled via the “model navigator.” An existing model created earlier can also be 
launched and modifi ed at will. With the model navigator, one can confi gure differ-
ent multiphysics, in addition to the available predefi ned ones, combining different 
modules. The latter include the following:
 
1. AC/DC module
 
2. Acoustic module
 
3. Chemical engineering module
 
4. Earth Science module
 
5. Heat transfer module
 
6. MEMS module
 
7. RV module
 
8. Structural mechanics module
Within each module, numerous submodules exist. Using the GUI, various modules 
and submodules are combined to model a large variety of problems. For example, 
combining the chemical engineering module with heat transfer and AC/DC modules,

MHD capability is produced and can be applied to the modeling of electromagnetic 
stirring (EMS) and electromagnetic braking (EMBr) in continuous casting of steel. 
COMSOL also offers fl exible equation-based modeling using p.d.e. In this, the mod-
eler creates his/her own equations. A material library is available; facility to use and 
import values from MaTweb® also exists.
The governing equations are solved using both direct and iterative solvers. Fully 
coupled and sequential solution techniques are also available. COMSOL has an 
excellent postprocessing facility and allows interactive visualization of a variable 
or function in space and time. Evaluations of arbitrary functions including line, sur-
face, and volume integrals are also possible. COMSOL script augments COMSOL 
multiphysics on many fronts and helps enhance latter’s capabilities. For example, 
built-in functions for model validation and calibration, high-speed graphics, optional 
add-ons for reaction engineering, optimization, etc. available in COMSOL script 
make the software versatile. The modular program structure of COMSOL is shown 
in Figure 4.8.

areas are presented fi rst. This is followed by a discussion of mechanistic modeling 
of steelmaking wherein relevant building blocks, governing equations, and bound-
ary conditions are described. The roles of hardware and software are also briefl y 
discussed and it is pointed out that high performance hardware and robust, user-
friendly softwares provide the much needed power and versatility to model com-
plex steelmaking processes. Uncertainties in model predictions are also reviewed 
briefl y and to this end, the role of mathematical and physical modeling backed up 
by pilot- or industrial-scale trials is highlighted. It has been emphasized that an 
appropriately validated model alone constitutes a reliable basis for industrial process 
analysis, design, and optimization. Finally, a brief outline of the numerical solution 
of differential equations is presented and some key concepts explained via a worked 
example. The chapter concludes with a brief overview of two currently popular com-
mercial software packages.

Answer the following briefl y. Support your answers with numbers, expressions, and 
sketches, wherever appropriate.
 
i. The required number of initial and boundary conditions are generally 
determined by the nature of the p.d.e’s and particularly by the highest order 
derivatives.
 
ii. At the solid wall a “no-slip” condition on fl ow is typically applied.
 iii. At a fl ow outlet, all elliptic equations are locally treated as parabolic, 
and hence no specifi c information on the dependent variable is required 
there.
 
iv. It is currently possible to carry out industrial-scale modeling of steelmaking 
at a remarkable speed in a cost-effective manner.
 
v. High-end work stations, large main frames, and supercomputers are 
generally needed for the effective simulation of steelmaking processes.

 vi. Any signifi cant modeling effort is likely to embody a much bigger cost than 
is afforded by the software and hardware combined.
 vii. The speed at which a given phenomenon is successfully mathematically 
modeled has assumed tremendous signifi cance in the present time.
 viii. While computer codes built in-house were primarily applied to model 
steelmaking in the previous decades, commercial CFD software is being 
increasingly applied currently.
 ix. Some experimental backup is always desirable in modeling of steelmaking.
 
x. Casting all relevant differential equations of interest in a form identical to 
the general differential equation leads to considerable savings in time.
 xi. Efforts required to solve a differential equation vary with the numerical 
method.
 xii. In converting a differential equation to its equivalent algebraic analog, we 
are obligated to employ a discontinuous representation.
 xiii. The continuity equation becomes redundant if the pressure fi eld is known 
or prescribed.
 xiv.  A perfectly satisfactory numerical technique might produce worthless 
results if an inadequate mathematical model is applied.
 xv. Scarcity of reliable high-temperature kinetic data and transport coeffi cients 
in general pose problems in rigorous modeling of steelmaking.

5 Mathematical Modeling I: 
Fluid Flow
5.1 INTRODUCTION
Rate calculation in steelmaking is rarely possible without detailed knowledge of fl uid 
fl ow. Thus knowledge of fl ow is generally a prerequisite to the prediction, analysis, 
and control of various steelmaking processes such as melting, dissolution, disper-
sion, inclusion removal, solidifi cation, and so on. Flow phenomena play important 
roles even in interfacial chemical reactions such as desulfurization, decarburization, 
etc., which are generally mass transfer-controlled. Fundamental aspects of fl uid fl ow 
phenomena have been briefl y reviewed in Chapter 2. In this chapter, starting with 
laminar fl ows, modeling of homogeneous and two-phase/multiphase turbulent fl ows 
as well as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) are described, wherein specifi c fl ow 
examples are taken up to explain the underlying fl ow modeling principles. In our 
treatment of the subject, maximum emphasis is laid on conceptual modeling and for-
mulation. Accordingly assumptions in modeling, governing equations, and boundary 
conditions are described in detail. Validation of mathematical model results which is 
an important issue is also concurrently discussed, wherever possible.
Gross features of melt fl ow in various steel processing units are summarized 
in Table 5.1. This suggests that fl ow phenomena in steelmaking furnaces, ladles, 
tundish, and molds are inherently multidimensional, multiphase, reacting, and tur-
bulent. Naturally therefore, fl ow modeling in steelmaking entails signifi cant efforts. 
Idealizations, as we shall shortly see, are possible and allow one to model “reacting, 
multiphase turbulent fl ows” in many situations with reasonable certainty.
5.2 MODELING OF LAMINAR FLOW
Laminar or viscous fl ow occurs at low Reynolds number. Large size of steelmaking 
reactors, low kinematic viscosity of steel as well as high intensity of agitation pre-
cludes low Reynolds number fl ows. Therefore, laminar fl ows are rarely encountered 
in steel making. This is also evident from Table 5.1. Nonetheless laminar fl ows are 
always prevalent in the vicinity of refractory lined vessel walls, in the lower region 
of a continuous casting strand, etc. Flow in holding ladles, particularly in the absence 
of any gas stirring, is also likely to be laminar. Thermosolutal free convection phe-
nomena generally give rise to laminar fl ow.
Despite their infrequency occurrence, as a starting point, modeling of laminar 
fl ows is taken up as this allows easy elucidation of different underlying concepts and 
sets the stage for discussion of more complex topics later in this chapter. As specifi c

examples, two different laminar fl ow problems, namely, fl ows in rotating viscom-
eters and holding ladles are described in the following reactions. The former repre-
sents laminar forced convection* and the latter, laminar thermal natural convection.
5.2.1 FLUID FLOW IN ROTATING VISCOMETER
Rotating viscometers fi nd widespread application in viscosity measurements and are 
important to metallurgists concerned with the measurement of viscosity of liquid met-
als and slag. A viscometer high-temperature furnace assembly is shown schemati-
cally [1] in Figure 5.1. During measurement of viscosity of liquid metals or slag, the 
*  Numerical simulation of laminar fl ows in holding ladles arising out of thermal-free convection (Section 
5.2.2) requires simultaneous modeling of both fl uid fl ow and heat transfer phenomena. Computation of 
such fl ows is a bit more complex than that of isothermal fl ows in rotating viscometer.

material, whose viscosity is to be determined is kept in a crucible contained in a verti-
cal furnace maintained at a constant temperature. The viscometer is immersed into 
the liquid up to a predetermined depth and the spindle rotated at a slow speed. With 
the rotation of the spindle, the torque progressively increases attaining ultimately a 
steady equilibrium value corresponding to the rotational speed of the spindle. During 
the process, the rotational speed is maintained at a few r.p.m such that there is little 
fl ow disturbances and laminar fl ow condition prevails. One-dimensional (1-D) fl ow 
theory and calibration data are applied to translate the measured torque and the rota-
tional speed to the corresponding shear stress and strain rate. On the basis of these 
 latter parameters, the viscosity of the melt is estimated. Measurements are repeated for 
several rotational speeds of the spindle to obtain a representative average viscosity.
5.2.1.1 Problem Description
The equilibrium torque or the equivalent shear stress acting on the spindle’s surface 
is related to fl uid fl ow and is a direct consequence of the viscosity of the liquid.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Therefore, given the viscosity of the melt and the rotational speed of the spindle, 
fl ows within the crucible and the associated shear stress acting on the surface of the 
viscometer’s spindle can be estimated from the theory of fl uid fl ow.
A closer examination of the fl ow in the crucible-viscometer assembly suggests 
the following:
 
1. Flow phenomena are three dimensional (3-D)* and laminar as the rotational 
speed imparted by the spindle is typically small (i.e., associated Reynolds 
number of the fl ow is accordingly small).
 
2. Equilibrium torque registered by viscometer corresponds to a steady fl ow 
condition.
 
3. Flow phenomena are isothermal.
 
4. The fl uid is Newtonian is incompressible. Furthermore, thermophysical 
properties of the fl uid are constant as the operating temperature and pres-
sure are fi xed.
These suggest that hydrodynamics in rotating viscometer is best described via 
a steady, 3-D laminar fl ow model in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinate 
system.
*  It is possible to take advantage of the axisymmetrical geometry (see Figure 5.2) and apply instead, 
a 2-D, axisymmetrical fl ow model.

In Equations 5.2 through 5.4, p is the dynamic gauge pressure referenced to the 
local hydrostatic pressure. The equations are exact and are as many as the dependent 
variables are. There are four equations and four unknowns (i.e., vz, vr, vq, and p), 
and hence given the adequate set of boundary conditions, we have a well-posed 
 mathematical problem.

The number of boundary conditions required to defi ne the fl ow problem is

The fl ow geometry is bounded by walls and a free surface. Considering that no spe-

The boundary conditions summarized above are standard for a geometry bounded 
by a free surface, bottom, and side walls. In addition, to accommodate the rotational 
effect of the spindle–rod assembly, a rigid body rotational condition within the entire 
volume of the solid spindle and the rod is required. In this way, the fl uid is made 
to experience the correct boundary conditions. Many procedures exist to this end. 
* Due to the cyclic nature of the θ-axes, no specifi c boundary information is required. Note that depen-
dent variables have identical numerical values at θ = 0 and θ = 2π, respectively [3].

One such technique relies on a “harmonic mean interpolation” of the diffusion 
 coeffi cient, i.e., in this case dynamic viscosity. The concept is frequently used to 
model conjugate problems [3], in which both solid and liquid coexist in the fl ow 
domain.
The fl uid velocity at a solid surface is typically specifi ed assuming a no-slip 
condition (Section 4.3.2). However, in high temperature fl ow systems such as the one 
under current consideration, where large differences in interfacial tensions might 
exist among various phases (i.e., graphite crucible, melt, and spindle material), 
complete wettability between solid and melt is unlikely. Under such condition, the 
assumption of no-slip may not be entirely tenable. Extremely small rotational speeds 
and submergence of spindle well below the meniscus ensure an essentially fl at and 
stationary melt-free surface. A zero normal velocity together with zero tangential 
shear prescribed at the free surface are therefore reasonably accurate.
5.2.1.3 Model Prediction and Validation
The governing equations together with the set of boundary conditions can be read-
ily solved through one of the many public domain or commercial computational 
fl uid dynamics (CFD) softwares. Thus given the exact nature of the governing equa-
tions and boundary conditions, highly accurate results are expected from a care-
fully designed numerical simulation [2]. This is clearly shown in Figure 5.3. It can 
therefore be concluded that provided resolution of the mesh is suffi ciently high and 
the mathematical model is accurate, a robust calculation procedure produces results 
similar to those observed experimentally.
5.2.2 THERMAL NATURAL CONVECTION IN STEELMAKING LADLE
Heat losses through refractory lined walls, the free surface, etc. in holding ladles and 
similar transfer vessels induce thermal inhomogeneities and stratifi cation in the melt.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Difference in temperature leads to variation in density and in turn  generates natu-
ral convection currents which may assume signifi cance in an otherwise  unagitated 
steel melt. Such fl ows are typically weak and are therefore, expected to be lami-
nar or at best, weakly turbulent. Radioactive-isotope-based fl ow measurements 
from a 7 Ton pilot-scale ladle are shown in Figure 5.4 [4]. There, as seen, measured 
velocity ranges between 10 and 50 mm/s. This together with the dimension of the 
ladle and the kinematic viscosity of steel suggests Reynolds number in the range of 
1000–5000, confi rming the above supposition.
In order to quantify the extent of thermal stratifi cation in holding vessels, math-
ematical modeling is often carried out as rigorous mapping of temperature fi elds in 
large steel processing units is cumbersome and diffi cult. Calculation of thermal nat-
ural convection requires simultaneous solution of mutually coupled fl ow and thermal 
energy transport equations. As heat is continuously lost from the melt, temperature 
tends to vary with time and therefore the transient simulation of fl ow and heat trans-
fer is involved. To mathematically formulate thermal natural convection phenomena 
in steel processing ladles, the following assumptions have been made:
 
1. Flow and thermal energy transport is 3-D, unsteady, and mutually 
coupled.
 
2. Natural convection phenomena are laminar.
 
3. Flow is Newtonian and incompressible. Furthermore, thermophysical prop-
erties of the fl uid such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity are 
function of temperature.
The ladle geometry together with the working coordinate system is illustrated in 
Figure 5.5. In the modeling of thermal natural convection phenomena, thermal

buoyancy force driving the fl ow is required to be accommodated in the Navier–
Stokes equations. This is accomplished invoking Boussinesq’s approximation and 
is described below.
Thermal buoyancy assumes important in nonisothermal fl ow systems. For 
example, the temperature of a fl uid element in the bulk of a ladle is greater than 
the one in the vicinity of the solid walls or free surface due to the continuous loss 
of heat to the ambient through refractory walls, the free surface, etc. Such thermal 
 differential leads to density variation inducing convection currents or fl ow in the ladle 
(heavier liquid under the action of gravity goes down and lighter liquid rises). The 
effect of density variation on fl ow is modeled via the barometric formula (ρ − ρ∞)gz 
(note that, gz = −g) and this is inserted as the volumetric thermal buoyancy force term 
[5] in the axial direction momentum balance equation.* Since the temperature fi eld is 
changing with time and position, ρ in the above is unknown. Once the temperature 
fi eld is known or somehow calculated, the density fi eld is defi ned uniquely.
The variation of density as a function of temperature follows from the defi nition 
of the isobaric thermal expansivity of the fl uid, βT, according to

As drop in temperature and the corresponding changes in ρ in steelmaking are 
expected to be small, consequently Equation 5.5 can be represented as
* ρ∞ is the density of liquid at some arbitrarily fi xed reference temperature T∞ and is known.

This is added directly to the axial or vertical direction momentum conservation equa-

fl ow calculation. Furthermore, since convection and diffusion govern the temperature 
fi eld, hence modeling of thermal natural convection warrants simultaneous solution of 
fl ow and thermal energy conservation equations. The governing equations of fl ow and 
thermal energy balance are represented in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinate as

The initial condition requires that the three velocity components and temperature of 
the melt are known at time t = 0. Initial fi eld distribution is either assumed (for exam-
ple, a stationary melt with a uniform temperature) or obtained from a mathematical 
model of the immediate upstream operation. Boundary conditions on fl ow variables 
are straightforward and similar to those described in the preceding section. In addition, 
empirically determined heat fl ux is required on ladle walls and the free surface.
Heat fl ux leaving through specifi c ladle surfaces depends on ladle size, type of 
refractory lining, slag thickness, or a physical ladle cover and therefore, vary from 
plant to plant. Surface heat fl ux data constitute the most vital input to a thermal natu-
ral convection model. For different size ladles, operating heat fl uxes through various 
surfaces are summarized in Table 5.3.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Thermal-free convection phenomena in steel processing units have been inves-
tigated by many investigators. In one of the studies [4], the transient temperature 
fi eld in a pilot-scale holding ladle has been predicted via a low Reynolds number 
turbulence model and compared directly against experimental measurements. This 
is illustrated in Figure 5.6. Excellent agreement between prediction and measure-
ment demonstrates effectiveness of the model study program.

5.3 MODELING OF TURBULENT FLOW
Turbulent rather than laminar fl ows are more frequent in steelmaking. A brief 
discussion of the phenomena of fl uid turbulence together with the essentials of 
numerical modeling of turbulent fl ows is presented in Chapter 2. Specifi c examples 
of turbulent fl ows in steelmaking and their modeling are discussed in this  chapter. 
Essentials of single phase as well as multiphase turbulent fl ow modeling are described 
in the following sections.
5.3.1 HOMOGENEOUS TURBULENT FLOW IN SLAB CASTER MOLD
Interactions among phases (i.e., gas, solid, and melt) are frequent in steelmaking, 
and therefore fl ows in steel processing units are inherently multiphase. Such fl ows 
are diffi cult to replicate physically and accordingly, tundish, continuous slab cast-
ing molds, etc. are customarily physically modeled as a single-phase fl ow system. 
Idealizations although simplistic, provide useful insight, as was seen in Chapter 3. 
In some situations, interactions among phases are not quite widespread and as a result, 
grossly, single phase or homogeneous turbulent fl ow condition can be assumed to 
prevail. Examples include fl ows through submerged entry nozzles (SENs) in continu-
ous casting, slide gates, and so on. Single-phase fl ow approximation is also valid and 
works satisfactorily under certain conditions. For example, during a long sequence 
casting, melt fl ow in steelmaking tundish, with an undisturbed upper slag, can be 
reasonably approximated as a single-phase fl ow system. Mathematical modeling of 
homogeneous turbulent fl ow in a continuous slab casting mold is described in the 
following section to elucidate the underlying principles.
5.3.1.1 Problem Description
In continuous casting, molten steel is delivered through a SEN into a water-cooled 
copper mold where circulating water removes superheat to initiate solidifi cation of 
the melt. In slab casting, the Reynolds number of the fl ow entering through a SEN is 
generally appreciable (often greater than 104 or so) and this help induce a turbulent 
recirculatory fl ow of molten steel in the mold. The fl ow infl uences superheat dissipa-
tion, solidifi cation microstructure, mold powder entrapment, etc. affecting the qual-
ity of the fi nal steel product. It is now generally acknowledged that many operational 
and quality problems initiating in the mold owe their origin to the very nature of the 
associated turbulent fl uid fl ow phenomena. While SEN port design and dimensions 
govern the fl ow and hence the delivery of heat to the narrow faces, the submergence 
of a SEN below the free surface infl uences meniscus fl uctuations and creates vor-
tices leading to mold powder entrapment. Many such complexities associated with 
continuous slab caster mold are depicted through a schematic in Figure 5.7 [8].
The extent of solidifi cation in a continuous slab caster mold is typically small.* 
As a consequence, the general nature of fl ow in the mold region has been frequently 
investigated with scaled water models. Furthermore, observations made from 
*  A fraction of the superheat is only removed in the mold. By far, the largest amount of heat is extracted 
in the spray cooling zone where solidifi cation is taken to completion.

the water model are applied to validate mathematical models prior to the latter’s 
 extrapolation to full-scale operation. In the following section, mathematical model-
ing of fl ows in a water model of a slab casting mold [9] is described to illustrate the 
basic principles of homogeneous turbulent fl ow modeling.
A scaled water model of a SEN—mold assembly together with its principal 
dimensions are shown in Figure 5.8 [9]. This shows entry of liquid into a mold hav-
ing a rectangular cross section through downwardly angled square ports of a bifur-
cated nozzle. Typically, the volumetric fl ow rate of water through the SEN is scaled 
in accordance with the Froude criterion such that dynamic similarity with the actual

is maintained. Through the bottom of the mold, the liquid leaves via several outlets. 
The outfl ow is regulated in such a manner that a constant liquid depth results in 
the system. Macroscopically, the fl ow is therefore steady. In summary, the general 
characteristics of the fl ow in the water model are
 
1. Three-dimensional
 
2. Turbulent (i.e., Reynolds number = (din Uin/vwater) of the fl ow is signifi cant)
 
3. Steady,* incompressible, Newtonian, and isothermal
 
4. Symmetrical with respect to the central vertical axis†
Furthermore, thermophysical properties are constant as operating temperature and 
pressure are fi xed.
*  The fl ow phenomena in slab casting mold are truly quasi-steady. Therefore, an unsteady formulation 
can capture many short term fl ow transients or periodicity in such system, providing further insight. 
An unsteady state formulation of the present problem is discussed in the following section.
† This allows one to consider only one-half of the mold as the relevant portion of the fl ow domain.

5.3.1.2  Steady-State Formulation: Governing Equations 
and Boundary Conditions
The steady turbulent fl ow in a continuous casting mold is modeled most conveniently 
combining the Reynolds average Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations with an appro-
priate turbulence model (say, the k–ε turbulence model). For the geometry shown in 
Figure 5.8, the time-averaged equations of continuity and motion are represented in 
conservative form in terms of the Cartesian coordinate system as*

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Cµ, σk, σε, C1, and C2 in the above are the fi ve empirical constants of the k–ε turbu-
lence model (see Table 2.4).
Following the procedure outlined in Table 5.2, we can readily determine the 
required number of boundary conditions (i.e., on vx, vy, vz, p, k, and ε) and defi ne 
these appropriately to complete the statement of the problem. The various physical 
boundaries in the fl ow system as shown in Figure 5.8 are
 
1. Mold walls (i.e., stationary solid walls)
 
2. Free surface (i.e., the ambient–water interface)
 
3. Symmetry plane (i.e., the central longitudinal vertical plane)
 
4. Outlet
 
5. Flow inlet
Specifi c boundary conditions on fl ow components and turbulence parameters 
include
 
1. All fl ow components as well as k and ε are zero at the stationary solid 
walls.
 
2. Normal component of the fl ow and tangential shear are zero at the free 
surface. Accordingly, the gradients of k and ε are also zero at the free 
surface.
 
3. Flow normal to the plane of symmetry is zero. In addition, gradients of 
fl ow parallel to the symmetry plane as well as gradients of k and ε are zero 
there.
 
4. Standard outfl ow conditions apply on all variables at the fl ow outlet.
 
5. Prescribed velocity, k and ε fi elds at the inlet.*
Apart from these, to incorporate the presence of the SEN in the fl ow domain, specifi c 
procedures as those mentioned in Section 5.2.1 are required. In addition, law of walls 
is needed for realistic modeling of near wall fl ows, where fully turbulent conditions 
do not exist. Such features are common to turbulent fl ow modeling and are always 
in-built in commercial CFD softwares. The various building blocks together with a 
scheme of the homogeneous turbulent fl ow calculation are shown in Figure 5.9.
5.3.1.3 Transient Formulation
Water model trials have indicated that fl ows in slab caster molds are inherently tran-
sient. Therefore, conceptually different fl ow modeling technique is necessary, since 
unsteady state RANS equations together with the k–ε turbulence model do not tend to 
* At the fl ow inlet, a unidimensional fl ow condition is generally assumed and a cross section average, 
normal to inlet, velocity prescribed. Similarly, depending on the inlet velocity and dimensions, cor-
responding conditions on k and ε are prescribed. For example, inlet conditions on k and ε are often 
prescribed as a function of the intensity of turbulence, incoming kinetic energy and hydraulic radius 
etc. In steelmaking fl ow modeling, predicted fl ows are generally not sensitive to such prescriptions of 
k and ε [9].

capture the intricacies of transient turbulent fl ows accurately. While direct numerical 
simulation (DNS) is still not viable for all practical problems and that RANS-based 
approach is not rigorous enough for unsteady turbulent fl ow simulations, computa-
tional procedure based on a large eddy simulation (LES) has been advocated and 
applied to model transient fl ows in continuous slab casting molds [9]. As described 
in Section 2.3.5.5, LES calculates the large-scale motion and thereby captures many 
minute features of unsteady turbulent fl ows that are in generally not possible via the 
RANS-based approach.
Within the set of constraints mentioned earlier in Section 5.3.1.1 (except that fl ow 
is unsteady), the fi ltered equations of continuity and motion* (fi ltered entities are 
denoted here by an over bar) are represented according to

* The equations of motions are written here in terms of both fi ltered velocity and residual or subgrade-
scale stresses to illustrate the distinctive features of a LES formulation. The terms represented via τ 
are the subgrid-scale stresses and are uniquely related to large scale or fi ltered strain rate (proportional 
to large-scale velocity gradients) via a subgrid-scale model. In this way, fi ltered momentum equations 
can be expressed exclusively in terms of fi ltered velocity (Equation 2.63).

5.3.1.4 Model Prediction and Validation
Flows issuing from bifurcated SENs in continuous slab casting molds have been 
investigated both experimentally and computationally by many groups of research-
ers. Both steady as well as transient simulations have been carried out following 
essentially the procedure described in this section. In many instances, computa-
tional results have been validated against equivalent observations derived from 
water models. In the following, a comparison between predicted and experimental 
results on fl uid fl ow is shown [9] to demonstrate usefulness of such model study 
programs.
Time-averaged fl ow patterns along the central vertical plane of an aqueous 
model, deduced through particle image velocimetry (PIV), a k–ε model-based 
simulation, and an LES-based calculation procedure are shown in Figure 5.11. 
There, the jet characteristics as well as the overall fl ow pattern predicted via the 
LES are evidently in better agreement with the experimentally measured fl ow. It 
is important to note that time-averaged and instantaneous fl ows in such systems 
differ signifi cantly as fl ow phenomena in a slab caster mold have been found to 
be highly chaotic and time-dependent. The LES rather than RANS, is therefore 
expected to be more rigorous to model time-dependent fl ows in the slab caster 
mold. Modeling of coupled fl uid fl ow and heat transfer phenomena during con-
tinuous casting of steel is further discussed in Chapter 6.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
5.3.2 TWO-PHASE FLOW IN GAS-AGITATED VESSEL
Multiphase fl ows involving simultaneous motion of slag–metal and gas are common 
in steelmaking. A two-phase approximation holds good in many steel process-
ing units provided the volume of the third phase is small and does not inter-
act (e.g., essentially stagnant) with the remaining phases in any signifi cant way. 
For example, at low specifi c gas fl ow rates, argon–liquid steel fl ows in gas-stirred 
ladle systems in the presence of a thin slag are reasonably approximated as a two-
phase fl ow. Similarly, steady fl ows generated in a continuous casting tundish or mold 
through injection of argon bubbles can be essentially treated as two-phase fl ows.
Numerous approaches are available to mathematically model two-phase fl ows. 
To illustrate the basic philosophy of two-phase fl ow computation, fl ow in an argon-
stirred ladle has been taken up here as a specifi c example. Argon and liquid steel 
constitute a nonreacting, two-phase system and thereby offer considerable simplic-
ity in model development. The following four different approaches are commonly 
applied to model hydrodynamics of an argon-stirred ladle.
 
1. Quasi single-phase approach, in which, the rising gas liquid mixture is 
treated as a homogeneous liquid but with a reduced density. In this, the 
gas volume fraction within the plume together with the latter’s geometry is 
specifi ed a priori on the basis of either auxiliary models or experimental 
measurements.
 
2. Lagrangian–Eulerian two-phase approach (also termed the discrete-phase 
model, DPM ) in which, liquid-phase continuity and momentum balance 
equations are solved in conjunction with equations of bubble motion. The 
procedure, works on the concept of unequal phase velocities and in contrast 
to quasi single-phase modeling, provides estimates of gas volume fraction 
together with a plausible shape of the rising gas–liquid plume.
 
3. Eulerian two-phase approach (also termed as the two-fl uid model) in which 
continuity and momentum balance equations are solved for the gas as well 
as the liquid-phase continuum. Similar to the Lagrangian–Eulerian proce-
dure, the two-fl uid model provides estimates of gas volume fraction and 
plume geometry concurrent with the gas and liquid velocities.
 
4. Volume of fl uid (VOF) approach in which, the gas–liquid mixture is 
treated as one phase having properties which are an average of the prop-
erties of the individual phases. Only one set of continuity and momen-
tum equations is solved in conjunction with a volume advection equation. 
Appropriate geometrical schemes are embedded in the calculation pro-
cedure to provide information on the shape of interface between two or 
many phases.
Within each class of models, variations exist. While 2 and 3 are based on a dif-
ferential phase velocity, 1 and 4 in contrast employ a single, mixture velocity scale. 
Distinctive features of these calculation procedures are summarized in Table 5.4. 
Some of the approaches mentioned above can be extended to model multiphase fl ow 
systems as well.

5.3.2.1 Quasi-Single-Phase Procedure
The quasi or pseudo single-phase procedure is by far the most simplistic for mod-
eling of gas–liquid interactions and gas injection induced liquid motion [11]. In 
this, the gas–liquid two-phase region is treated as a homogeneous liquid but with 
a somewhat reduced density than the surrounding bulk. A single set of equations 
of motion represents fl ow in the liquid phase in which, buoyant force due to gas 
injection is embedded in the axial or vertical direction momentum conservation 
equation.
As shown in Figure 5.12, the buoyant force, FBuoy, due to gas injection is fi nite 
only within the plume and by defi nition is equivalent to the product of mass of dis-
placed fl uid (by the gas) and the acceleration due to gravity, g. We therefore have,

Since,

(5.35)
in which αav is the average volume fraction of gas within the plume. Thus to model 
the gas injection-induced motion, the volumetric buoyancy force term, ρlgαav, is 
incorporated directly as an additional body force term in the vertical direction 
equation of motion.
With reference to the system shown in Figure 5.12, the quasi-single-phase model 
is formulated embodying the following assumptions:
 
1. Flow is axisymmetrical and 2-D, turbulent, macroscopically steady,† and 
isothermal.
 
2. Thermophysical properties are constant.
 
3. Molten steel is incompressible and a Newtonian liquid.
The building blocks describing the idealized, two-phase fl ow system depicted in 
Figure 5.12b are
 
1. The RANS equations
 
2. The k–ε turbulence model
The time-averaged equations of continuity, motion, and turbulence are expressed in 
terms of the cylindrical polar coordinate system as

* Taking a simplistic approach and assuming a working fl ow rate referenced to the temperature of the 
melt and pressure at the mean bath height, Vgas can be worked out readily. The change in the injected 
gas volume can then be approximately accommodated through a corrected fl ow rate that is referenced 
to the actual operating condition. This implies that argon and liquid steel are in thermal equilibrium.
† Bubble plumes exhibit long-term and short-term wandering which tend to make the induced 
fl ow time-dependent and 3-D. Rigorously speaking, the assumption of steady, 2-D fl ow in an 
axisymmetrical fl ow confi guration is inadequate.

In the simplifi ed axisymmetrical fl ow model of an argon-stirred ladle, we have three 
equations (i.e., continuity + two equations of motion) and six unknowns, namely, 
vz, vr, p, µt, ρ, and αav. This necessitates that distribution of ρ, αv, and µt in the fl ow 
domain is known.
The mixture density, ρmix can be related to the density of gas and liquid on the 
basis of the continuum approximation as

Knowledge of plume dimension, Rp, is therefore a prerequisite to fl ow calculation. 
An approximate dimension of the plume can be prescribed on the basis of either 
experimental measurements (possible generally in water models) or a set of empirical 
correlations described in Section 8.3.3. Thus given the volume fraction of gas within

the plume, the density fi eld distribution is defi ned uniquely from the dimensions of 
the plume.
An estimate of volume fraction of gas within the plume is derived from the prin-
ciple of volume continuity embodying average rise velocity of the gas liquid mixture 
and plume dimension. Two distinct approaches exist. Based on the assumption of 
equal phase velocity (i.e., there is no slip and hence gas and liquid move together), 
the average gas volume fraction is given by

Alternatively, the drift fl ux model [12] is applied. In this, the gas is assumed to rise 
with respect to the surrounding liquid with a fi nite velocity, known as the slip veloc-
ity. The corresponding expression of average gas volume fraction, according to the 
drift fl ux model is†

Since Rp, the radius of the two-phase, plume is a function of liquid depth, Equation 
5.45 yields a cross-sectional average gas volume fraction at any particular axial sta-
tion, z. Clearly, in addition to the plume rise velocity, UP, and the radii of the plume, 
Rp, at various axial stations, a prescription for slip velocity, Us, is needed. As a fi rst 
approximation, slip velocity can be considered to be equivalent to the terminal rise 
velocity of a characteristic single bubble [13] in the system, i.e.,

† More realistic distribution of bubbles and the associated gas volume fraction follow from the popula-
tion balance approach outlined in Section 6.6.

regime.

Equations 5.46 and 5.47 are derived primarily from aqueous systems and hence the 
certainty with which these describe the behavior of argon bubbles in liquid steel is 
not known. Alternatively, experimentally determined gas volume fraction, if avail-
able, can be directly incorporated into Equation 5.38. This is possible only in water 
models since comprehensive measurements of gas volume fraction and plume dimen-
sion in industrial gas stirred units are diffi cult if not impossible. As a consequence,* 
the scope of the quasi-single-phase approach is seriously limited. Thus given the dis-
tribution of effective viscosity, bubble diameter, plume dimension, etc. the equations 
of continuity and motions are readily solved with an appropriate set of boundary 
conditions providing estimates of vz, vr, and p in the fl ow domain.
The turbulence viscosity in the momentum conservation equations are derived 
from a turbulence model. The standard coeffi cient, k–ε turbulence model, is fre-
quently used in the modeling of steady ladle fl ows. The conservation equations for k 
and ε and for 2-D, axisymmetrical fl ows are represented as

* Thermophysical properties (i.e., surface tension, density, etc.) of the system profoundly infl uence 
the size of bubble forming at orifi ces and nozzles. The size of the bubbles forming at nozzles or 
orifi ces in molten steel processing units is known to be substantially different from those in water 
model systems. Plumes in actual steel processing ladles at equivalent fl ow rates as a result are wider 
than their aqueous counterpart. These have been confi rmed experimentally by injecting nitrogen 
gas through mercury models as well as visually observing surfacing argon-steel plumes in full-scale 
steel processing units.

The standard coeffi cient k–ε turbulence model in a rigorous sense is not applicable 
to gas–liquid two-phase fl ows. The bubbles are known to generate turbulence within 
the plume via mutual interaction, wake shedding, and bubble wobbling mechanisms. 
These involve unsteady state transfer of energy from the rising bubbles to the liquid. 
In formulating turbulence production via bubbles viscous shear associated with such 
phenomena is generally assumed to be primarily responsible for additional turbu-
lence production. Incorporating extra turbulence production terms due to bubbles 
in the governing equations of k and ε [15], the k–ε turbulence model is adapted to 
two-phase fl ows. The net source terms in Equations 5.49 and 5.51 are accordingly

5.3.2.2 Discrete-Phase Procedure
This is a combined “Eulerian–Lagrangian” procedure in which liquid fl ow and 
turbulence are calculated on an Eulerian grid that is fi xed in space while the move-
ment of bubbles in the liquid on a Lagrangian frame of reference, moving with time. 
For a gas–liquid, two-phase turbulent fl ow simulation, the following three different 
building blocks defi ne the DPM.
 
1. Liquid-phase equations of continuity and motion
 
2. Equations of bubble motion and bubble trajectory
 
3. Liquid-phase turbulence model
Gas injection into a liquid involves a multitude of mutually interdependent complex 
phenomena. Therefore, rigorous modeling of gas–liquid, two-phase fl ows is expected

to be diffi cult.* In the present description of the DPM, the following phenomena have 
been entirely ignored,
 
1. Bubble size range and distribution
 
2. Bubble–bubble interaction
 
3. Volume expansion during bubble rise due to a change in ferrostatic head
 
4. Formation of spout, wavy free surface, and droplets
It is assumed here that monosize (determined say, on the basis of Equation 5.47), 
rigid spherical bubbles form at the orifi ce to rise up† through the melt. The volume of

 together with the volumetric gas injection rate then theoretically 
defi nes bubble frequency and hence, time differential between the discharges of two 
successive gas bubbles. In such formalism, if we work out on the basis of a gas fl ow 
rate that is referenced to the mean height and temperature of the liquid, the net effect 
of the injected gas on stirring can be accommodated reasonably well, albeit in an ad 
hoc manner. Furthermore, since bubble–bubble interaction is ignored, well-known 
drag laws (i.e., drag coeffi cient–Reynolds number relationship) for a single bubble 
apply and quantify the drag forces between the gas and the liquid phases. The gov-
erning equations representing the three building blocks are then represented for the 
axisymmetrical fl ow system in Figure 5.12b via

* Even by incorporating a population balance model (PBM) with fl ow, turbulence model, etc. numerical 
simulation of isothermal, nonreacting gas injection system can only be carried out approximately.
† A more comprehensive fl ow calculation procedure embodying many additional features of a gas–
liquid fl ow system can be formulated by coupling a discrete phase procedure with a bubble population 
balance model. The latter is described in Section 6.6.

2. Equation of bubble motion and bubble trajectory
The liquid-phase fl ow model, in addition to vz,l, vr,l, µt, and p embodies three 
additional unknowns, namely, the volume fraction of liquid, αl, and the components 
of the drag forces along the radial and the axial directions, i.e., FD,r and FD,z, respec-
tively. These later parameters are obtained from a separate model describing the 
motion and trajectory of bubbles in the liquid.
The equation of bubble motion is the Newton’s second law of motion and is rep-
resented in the following form considering various forces acting on a rising bubble

are available for the drag coeffi cient. These are generally applicable to a single 
particle/bubble–fl uid system. Bubble shape (viz., spherical, spherical cap, oblate 
spheroid, etc.), size (i.e., bubble diameter), fl ow regime (bubbly, churn turbulent 
fl ow, etc.) all infl uence the value of drag coeffi cient. Frequently applied drag laws 
are summarized in Table 5.7. Similarly, CL in the above is the lift coeffi cient. Bubble 
trajectory equations have been proposed solely on the basis of the lateral component

in which Ψ is a normally distributed random variable, i.e., −1 ≤ Ψ ≤ +1. It is through 
the random parameter, Ψ, the infl uence of fl uid turbulence on bubble motion is taken 
into account. Due to this, it is evident that successive bubble trajectories are unlikely 
to be identical. The bubbles, during their rise, are expected to traverse through many 
eddies experiencing markedly different turbulent conditions. Therefore, as long as a 
bubble is within a given eddy, the characteristic velocity fl uctuation remains constant.

The liquid volume fraction, αl, as well as the components of drag force FD,r and FD,z 
is determined knowing the bubble’s trajectory and population in the fl ow domain. 
Consider therefore a typical bubble trajectory superimposed over an Eulerian fi nite 
difference grid as shown in Figure 5.14 [17]. The contribution from each bubble tra-
jectory to gas volume fraction in a particular control volume is estimated from the 
principle of volume continuity according* to

The drag force acting on bubbles and liquids is equal in magnitude but opposite in 
direction.* Expressions of drag forces FD,z and FD,r are formulated on the basis of 
equivalent expressions for a single bubble. As a starting point, the drag force due to 
a single bubble is applied on the liquid volume element over the former’s period of 
residence. Subsequently, summing up contributions from Nb bubbles in the control 
volume and dividing the resultant expression by the corresponding mean bubble/gas 
residence time, drag force expressions corresponding to each individual trajectory 
are derived. Accordingly, for the z component, we have

* In this formulation, momentum transfer from the gas to the liquid is assumed to be solely due to the 
drag force. Rigorously, other surfaces forces like virtual or added mass and lift forces are also to 
be accounted for. Indeed, drag, lift, and virtual mass forces combined together dictate momentum 
transfer across the gas–liquid interface.

3. Liquid-phase turbulence model
In the two-phase fl ow simulation, the liquid-phase turbulence is generally modeled. 
Towards this, as indicated in the preceding section, turbulence models applicable 
to homogeneous fl ow are adapted incorporating additional turbulence production 
terms due to the gas phase. The modifi ed conservation equations for the liquid-phase 
turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate for axisymmetrical fl ows are repre-
sented in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinate system as

In Equations 5.86 and 5.88, Pb is the volumetric rate of turbulence production due 
to the dispersed phase. Considering turbulence production via bubbles is solely due 
to shear work, the rate of turbulence production can be directly related to drag force

in which Cb is an empirical parameter and lies between 0 and 1.
Boundary conditions on liquid-phase fl ow and turbulence parameters are identi-
cal to those described earlier in Section 5.3.2.1. For the equations of bubble motion, 
two additional conditions, one each on Vz,b and Vr,b at t = 0 are required. To this end, 
the free space velocity (i.e., fl ow rate/cross-sectional area) through the nozzle/orifi ce 
generally suffi ces.* The number of dependant variables and the total number of con-
ditions required to complete the formulation are worked out in Table 5.8. A scheme 
of the DPM calculation procedure is described in Figure 5.15 and is based on the 
following sequence of operations:
* A big gas envelope typically forms at the nozzle or orifi ce. Therefore, rigorously speaking, there is 
neither any bubble nor a bubble velocity at the nozzle tip. Consequently, setting the initial bubble 
velocity equal to the free space gas velocity is a gross idealization of the actual reality. Fortunately, the 
induced liquid velocity is not critical to such consideration.

Models of gas injection into liquids are also formulated on the basis of a two-fl uid, 
fully Eulerian approach, wherein continuity and momentum conservation equations 
are solved for both the gas and the liquid phases. This assumes that both phases may 
coexist in the same control volume at the same time and each phase consists of a con-
tinuous fi eld* interpenetrating and interacting with the other in the domain. For the

combination of bulk motion and eddy diffusion phenomena. The dispersion coeffi cient Dt, is related

In Equation 5.102, CD is the drag coeffi cient and is known from applicable drag 
law. Furthermore, Ab and Vb are respectively the projected area of a single charac-
teristic bubble and the corresponding volume. In a similar manner, the interphase 
friction force along the axial or z-direction is written.
3. Liquid-phase turbulence model
It is generally assumed that density and momentum of the gas relative to those of the 
liquid are typically small, and hence turbulence in the gas phase is unimportant. In 
the Eulerian two-phase approach, modeling of turbulence is accordingly restricted 
to the liquid phase alone. Accordingly, turbulence models originally developed for 
single-phase fl ow systems are adapted in the Eulerian two fl uid procedure. In most of 
the two fl uid simulations of gas injection in steelmaking, the k–ε turbulence model 
has been applied. There liquid-phase turbulence model equations are assumed to have 
a form analogous to those presented in Section 5.3.2.2. The turbulence model pro-
vides the distribution of turbulence viscosity and based on this, the dispersion coef-
fi cient in the gas-phase and the liquid-phase continuity equations are estimated, i.e.,
 
t

in which σD is the dispersion Prandtl number. Dispersion Prandtl number is unity 
provided eddy kinematic viscosity and the eddy dispersion coeffi cient are numeri-
cally equal. For an aqueous system, σD = 0.1 is reasonable. For a different system, 
this is deduced through trial and error [18].
The number of dependent variables and the corresponding number of equa-
tions together with the required number of boundary conditions are summarized in 
Table 5.9. There, as shown, eight partial differential equations and an auxiliary rela-
tionship* govern the nine unknowns. Boundary conditions on liquid-phase fl ow and 
turbulence equations are summarily the same as those mentioned in Section 5.3.2.2. 
In addition, gas velocity and volume fraction at the solid walls are set to zero while at 
the symmetry axis, conditions similar to those on liquid velocity and liquid  fraction 
* αl + αg = 1.0.

are imposed on the gas phase. At the free surface,* the escape or outfl ow boundary 
condition is applied. In addition, αg = 1 and αl = 0 are ensured at the gas inlet plane. 
A scheme of the Eulerian two-phase calculation is described below.
 
1. Based on a guess or currently prevailing velocity and turbulence fi elds, 
estimate the gas volume fraction distribution from Equation 5.96 (i.e., gas 
phase continuity)
 
2. Determine the corresponding volume fraction distribution of the second 
phase from αg + αl = 1.0
 
3. Solve the velocity fi elds based on a guess or the currently prevailing 
pressure fi eld and interphase frictional forces
 
4. Compute the pressure correction and the pressure fi eld via the liquid-phase 
continuity equation, i.e., Equation 5.91
 
5. Correct liquid velocity on the basis of the pressure correction†
 
6. With the corrected velocity, solve the liquid-phase turbulence model equations
 
7. Go back to step 1 and repeat till the continuity, momentum, and turbulence 
model equations converge
5.3.2.4 Volume of Fluid Procedure
The VOF [19] calculation is also applied to model two-phase and multiphase fl ow 
phenomena in liquid steel processing units. The approach relies on the concept 
of mixture velocity and hence solves only one set of continuity and momentum 
* In the Eulerian two-phase procedure, one can consider a free surface boundary located beyond the 
nominal liquid–ambient interface and in principle, compute the shape of the liquid free surface and 
the spout region from the predicted volume fraction distributions.
† Refer to Ref. [3] for more elaborate discussion on this.

equations that is in essence similar to the quasi-single-phase procedure. For two-
phase systems, in addition to the mixture continuity and momentum conservation 
equations, VOF method solves an additional volume advection equation* simultane-
ously with the fl ow and therefrom computes volume fraction distributions. In addi-
tion to the governing equations of continuity, motion, and volume advection, the 
procedure employs suitable grid-based geometrical schemes† for maintaining sharp 
interfaces between mutually interacting phases.
Unsteady state formulation procedure is relatively more common to a VOF simu-
lation. Thus even when the steady state behavior is of interest, VOF approaches the 
fi nal steady state through a series of transient solutions. The time-averaged equation 
of continuity and motion in terms of mixture velocity is represented‡ in the cylindri-
cal polar coordinate system (i.e., for the geometry shown in Figure 5.12b) as

* The number of volume advection equations used in the VOF method is one less than the total number 
of phases present since, volume fraction of the nth phase is known from volume fraction distributions 
of N − 1 phases.
† Many options exist. The better known ones are the simplifi ed line interphase calculation (SLIC), 
method due to Hirt and Nicolas [20] and method of Youngs [21].
‡ Gas bubbles move with different velocity relative to their surroundings, as slip, rather than no slip, 
is more typical of bubble motion in liquid. The concept of one single velocity scale for both phases 
is not consistent with the physics of bubble–liquid fl ow. The method is more suited to the tracking of 
interface in multiphase fl ow systems.

The incremental time-step size is important in unsteady VOF computation. A rea-
sonably fi ne mesh and an optimal time-step size are necessary to arrive at a stable 
and accurate solution. This is particularly true for problems with sharp interfaces. 
The effective viscosity, µe, in the momentum conservation equations is estimated 
from a turbulence model based on the mixture velocity. Turbulence modeling in 
VOF is essentially identical to that described in Section 5.3.2.1.
The boundary conditions on pressure, velocity, and turbulence parameters are 
identical to those summarized earlier, except that initial conditions on velocity, 
turbulence, and volume fraction are required. To this end, initially stagnant and 
nonturbulent* conditions can be applied. For the problem depicted in Figure 5.12b, 
additional boundary conditions on αg are required. These are

advection equation and estimate the distribution of gas volume fraction
 
2. Determine the corresponding volume fraction distribution of the second 
phase on the basis of αg + αl = 1.0
* This represents yet one more idealization, since application of a turbulence model from the beginning 
of gas injection is not correct. The fl ow within the bulk develops with time to become turbulent. During 
the initial period of gas injection, straight forward application of turbulence model is questionable.
† In this, the bottom wall (0 < r < R) is split into two regions encompassing the injection nozzle and 
the base.

5.3.2.5 Model Prediction and Validation
Flow phenomena in gas-stirred vessels were predicted by numerous researchers 
during the past three decades embodying broadly the concepts summarized in 
Section 5.3.2. Since direct validation of model results against a full-scale opera-
tion is practically impossible, predicted fl ow and turbulence parameters, gas volume 
fraction, plume dimensions, slag eye, etc. were generally assessed against equivalent 
measurements derived from water models of an argon-stirred ladle.
In Figure 5.16 [22], predicted axial fl ow via the quasi single phase, discrete phase, 
and two-fl uid models is illustrated. The three procedures predict velocity with compa-
rable accuracy and are similar to those measured experimentally. Despite equivalent 
accuracy, predictive capabilities of each class of models are vastly different, as we 
have seen already; for example, while quasi single-phase models require the geometry 
of the two-phase plume as an input, the discrete-phase approach, on the other hand, 
predicts many individual bubble trajectories and therefrom the shape of the two-
phase the plume. Similarly, liquid velocity and gas volume fraction distribution in the 
plume region predicted via the discrete phase and the Eulerian two-phase procedures 
are shown in Figure 5.17a and b, respectively [15,17]. Despite many uncertainties

and idealizations (i.e., uniform bubble size, single particle drag law, negligible 
bubble–bubble interaction, etc.), predicted velocity and gas volume fraction correspond 
reasonably with those measured. Finally, in Figure 5.18, transient VOF simulation 
of slag eye formation due to gas injection in an oil-covered water bath is shown as a 
function of time from the moment gas is injected in the system [23]. Reasonably close 
agreement between measurement and predictions is at once apparent.
  

222 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Various calculation procedures discussed so far embody many approximations 
and idealizations which tend to bring in uncertainty to the mathematical modeling 
of gas injection operations. Key issues on three different fronts are
1. Gas–liquid interaction
We still do not have a physically based sound model of bubble formation and the 
associated dynamics. Bubble size, drag coeffi cient, dispersion coeffi cient, etc. are 
also somewhat uncertain. Integration of a population balance model with a discrete 
phase or a two-fl uid model is likely to reduce some of the shortcomings, leading to a 
more realistic simulation of gas injection operation.
2. Free surface phenomena
The characteristics of the interface between the system and the surrounding and 
the associated phenomena are diffi cult to predict in real time with much certainty. 
The issue is further complicated due to the presence of slag in the actual system.
3. Two-phase turbulence
Modeling of turbulence in two-phase/multiphase fl ow systems is somewhat uncer-
tain. As DNS gains popularity, our reliance on the turbulence model in the future is 
expected to be minimal. Gas injection into liquids as such involves numerous com-
plexities. Consequently, DNS, PBM, VOF, etc. shall collectively play crucial roles in 
future modeling endeavors. Hence, one can readily anticipate the efforts needed to 
model chemically reacting, nonisothermal, multiphase fl ows of slag, metal, and gas 
in steelmaking.

5.4 MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS
Fluid fl ow phenomena exert profound infl uence practically at every stage of steel-
making. This is signifi cant in continuous casting wherein fl ow phenomena are known 
to infl uence surface fi nish, segregation, inclusion count, etc. affecting considerably 
the quality of fi nal product. Various in-mold fl ow control technologies have therefore 
been developed in recent years to improve the performance of continuous casting 
machines. Of these, the most remarkable has been the application of electromagnetic 
forces (EMF), which helps create desirable hydrodynamic conditions in the mold 
leading to superior product quality.
Depending on process requirements, electromagnetic stirring (to intensify motion) 
and electromagnetic braking (to damp motion) are applied. The former is applied to 
long products (e.g., billets or blooms) to improve homogeneity of the cast structure. 
On the other hand, electromagnetic braking is more popular in slab (particularly 
thin slab) casting where high velocity of molten steel in the mold* is considerably 
damped leading to better surface fi nish, minimal slag/inclusion entrapment, and so 
on. The AC magnetic fi eld is applied to promote stirring while the DC fi eld to damp 
fl ow.† Electromagnets have been designed and developed to achieve such objectives. 
Higher casting speed necessitates a new type of in-mould stirring that combines both 
accelerating and braking features (i.e., multimodal operation). A slab casting mold 
equipped with electromagnets is shown schematically in Figure 5.19.
5.4.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES AND GOVERNING EQUATIONS
The foundation of MHD is extensively covered in an excellent text by Davidson 
[24]. In the following section, a brief overview of the subject relevant to continuous 
casting is presented. As a current is passed through conducting coils that surround 
a mold-containing molten steel, which acts as a conductor, the current induces an 
electrical force, known as the Lorentz force within the volume of the conducting 
liquid. Lorentz force acting on the conductor carrying a current in a magnetic fi eld 
is expressed via
 
emf
F
J
B
=
×



 
(5.111)
in which J
ù is the current density and B
ù is the magnetic fl ux density. It is by incor-
porating the Lorentz force into the equations of motion the infl uence of the EMF on 
fl uid fl ow is taken into account. Two different versions of momentum conservation 
equations are shown to highlight the formulation:
* Throughput rate from one strand in a slab caster is signifi cantly higher than that in bloom or billet 
caster.
† In general, the induced electric current and the Lorentz force tend to oppose the mechanisms that 
create them. Movements causing electromagnetic induction are systematically braked by the resulting 
Lorentz force. When induction occurs in the presence of a time-varying magnetic fi eld the net effect is 
the stirring of liquid by the Lorentz force.

In MHD analysis, two different formalisms, namely, the magnetic induction 
method and the electrical potential method are popular. In the following, the basic 
principles of the two methods are briefl y presented. In the magnetic induction 
method, we fi rst seek the distribution of B

by considering three linear electromagnetic equations, namely,

This is used to assess the relative strength of convection to diffusion of magnetic 
fi elds. An extreme situation is encountered as in many liquid metals when the 
magnetic Reynolds number is typically small, i.e., the process is diffusion domi-
nated. Thus a magnetic fi eld diffuses to the form it would have in a stationary fl uid, 
even in the presence of fl uid motion in the system. Accordingly, Equation 5.117 is

Under such condition, the imposed magnetic fi eld, Bo, is expected to be hardly 
infl uenced by the fl uid motion (i.e., the induced fi eld is therefore entirely ignored). 
As a result of such an approximation,* B
ù is replaced by the known fi eld B
ù
o in all the 
MHD equations. This is an important simplifi cation and helps eliminate nonlinearity 
from the governing equation. The distribution of the magnetic fi eld within molten 
steel is hence described via an equation of the following form:

also small.

To show that the ratio of induced to applied magnetic fi eld is of the order of NRe,m 
and hence to conclude that if magnetic Reynolds number is small the induced 
magnetic fi eld is small and inconsequential to MHD analysis.
The order of the induced magnetic fi eld B
ù is obtained from ∇ × B
ù = µm J
ù and 
is equal to µm Ji LC, in which LC is a characteristic length scale. Since J
ù = σc(E

On the basis of the above, the induced magnetic fi eld expressed in terms of the

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Since Rem = UC LC/λm the ratio between the induced and imposed magnetic fi elds is 
of the order of magnetic Reynolds number. For a small value of magnetic Reynolds 
number, the imposed fi eld is greater than the induced fi eld and vice versa. Therefore, 
with Rem << 1 it is appropriate to carry out analysis on the basis of the imposed 
magnetic fi eld alone.
In a 3-D, unsteady state situation, altogether 3 p.d.e’s and 21 conditions (6 bound-
ary and 1 initial conditions on each component of the applied magnetic fi eld, B
ù
o) are 
required to defi ne the MHD problem completely. Initial conditions in unsteady MHD 
are straightforward. For example, in continuous casting the initial condition on the 
magnetic fi eld prior to energizing the stirrer is B
ù
o = 0. Boundary conditions in space 
involve specifying conditions on both normal and tangential components of B
ù
o at all 
surfaces. Depending on the nature of the surrounding i.e., insulated, vacuum, etc. 
due approximations are made and accordingly boundary conditions are  specifi ed. 
Thus, if the region adjoining the boundary is nonconducting or vacuum, the nor-
mal component of the magnetic fi eld is set to zero there. Tangential components of 
B
ù
o at the boundary depend on the nature of electromagnetic fi eld and are therefore 
machine dependent.
It is relatively more convenient to express boundary conditions in terms of 
the current rather than magnetic fi eld. This is so as ∇.J
ù = 0, i.e., conservation of cur-
rent fl ux is secured at all boundaries. Typically, the normal component of current Jn 
is taken to be continuous across the boundary and is zero, if the region adjoining the 
boundary is either nonconducting or vacuum or if an insulating layer constitutes the 
boundary. Since

 condition on the normal component of J
ù becomes 
a condition on the tangential components of B
ù
o with respect to distances measured 
along the boundary that is normal to the component.
Once the spatial distribution of B
ù
o is computed, the state of the system is uniquely 
fi xed and J
ù is obtained from Ampere’s law. Subsequently the product J

MHD calculations.
The second approach, which is relatively simpler, is to solve the electric potential 
equation and calculate current density using Ohm’s law. In general, the total electric 
fi eld E

tor potential, Aù, according to

Such a formulation is particularly useful with a problem where the induced 
magnetic fi eld has little physical signifi cance as in the case of the low magnetic 
Reynolds number approximation. Two different types of boundary conditions are 
applied and these include insulated and conducting boundary approximations. 
At a conducting boundary,† Φe = Φe,o, where Φe,o is the specifi ed potential at the

be calculated from Equation 5.124 and hence the product J

o is formed via 
Equation 5.122.
The current fi eld is also responsible for heating of liquid. The corresponding

Joule heating is accommodated in the thermal energy conservation equation. In a 
rigorous sense MHD calculation needs iteration between electromagnetics and fl uid 
dynamics, as these appear as mutually coupled phenomena [25]. This is illustrated 
in Figure 5.20a. However, in the case of in-mold MHD phenomena, as in continuous 
casting of steel, the low magnetic Reynolds number approximation holds and hence 
the velocity electromotive force, i.e., U
ù × B
ù is ignored. Such an approximation allows 
us to decouple electromagnetics from fl uid dynamics. Consequently, in continuous 
casting as well as in induction melting of steel, MHD calculation is often such that 
the EMF distribution is calculated fi rst and is followed by fl uid dynamic calculations. 
A scheme of such a calculation is shown in Figure 5.20b. Given the electromotive 
force distribution, fl ow calculations is then essentially similar to those described 
already. MHD is subsequently coupled with suitable process models for analyses of 
* This implies no accumulation of charges in the liquid. Equation 5.125 is the simplifi ed expression 
of continuity.
† Equation 5.126 is analogous to the heat conduction equation. As heat fl ux or temperature at the 
boundary is known from measurements so is the static potential Φe at various boundaries.

mixing, inclusion population distribution, etc. Most of the popular commercial CFD 
packages have MHD capabilities.
5.4.2 MODEL PREDICTION AND VALIDATION
Due to the diffi culty in conducting experiment with molten steel, numerous inves-
tigators have attempted to evaluate the impact of electromagnetic stirring (EMS) 
and electromagnetic braking (EMBr) technologies on continuous casting process 
through MHD. In these, the turbulent fl ow fi elds, in the presence of EMF have been 
modeled by coupling the Maxwell’s equation with the relevant equations of continu-
ity and motion. RANS equations with k–ε turbulence model as well as fi ltered fl ow 
equations with appropriate subgrid-scale models were also applied. In few studies, 
cold models employing mercury as the liquid have also been employed to assess the 
reliability of model prediction.
The impact of EMBr in continuous casting is illustrated via a set of three numer-
ically predicted results [26] in Figure 5.21a through c. These clearly indicate that 
the application of a horizontal magnetic fi eld of intensity 0.3 T leads to considerable 
slowing down of liquid fl ow in the mold. Such trends in computed results correspond 
reasonably well with equivalent experimental measurements shown in Figure 5.22a 
through c.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
5.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
A wide range of topics including laminar fl ow, homogeneous turbulent fl ow, 
two-phase and multiphase fl ows as well as MHD is discussed in this chapter to enun-
ciate the basic principle of fl ow and turbulence modeling in steelmaking. Throughout 
the chapter, emphasis has been on conceptual modeling and problem formulation. 
Accordingly, assumptions in modeling, governing equations, and boundary condi-
tions are given maximum attention. To demonstrate our approach, experimental vali-
dation (primarily w.r.t aqueous systems) of a variety of fl ow models are considered 
in this chapter. It is shown that provided governing equations and their associated 
boundary conditions are realistic, a near perfect agreement between measurements 
and prediction is possible. This is however rarely the case, since considerable ide-
alizations and approximations are inherent to the modeling of fl ow phenomena in 
steelmaking. Despite such, evidence cited in this chapter indicates that gross features 
of steelmaking hydrodynamics are currently modeled with reasonable certainty.

Steelmaking, from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) to the caster, entails a variety of 
rate processes such as melting, dissolution, refi ning, postcombustion, mixing, and 
so on. While these help control composition, temperature, and cleanliness of the 
melt, their rates determine shop fl oor effi ciency and therefore performance of a steel 
mill. As the associated rates of typical processing operations are generally transport 
controlled, adequate knowledge of fl uid fl ow and turbulence* becomes a prerequisite 
to rate phenomena analysis in steelmaking. How the fl ow fi eld is obtained is already 
outlined in Chapter 5. Having acquired the fl ow somehow, be this experimental or 
calculated, our objective is to quantify various rate processes in steelmaking. In 
the following sections, starting with the subsurface motion of solid additions, math-
ematical modeling of melting, dissolution, material and thermal mixing, inclusion 
transport and removal, reacting fl ows, and solidifi cation are described.
6.2 MOTION OF SOLID ADDITION IN STEEL MELT
Large amounts of solids are routinely added to steel melts to control composition, 
temperature, and cleanliness. Following their projection, solid additions move sub-
surface in a trajectory that is determined by its size, entry velocity, density, etc. 
During the period an addition remains subsurface and moves in a molten steel bath, 
it is exposed to variable hydrodynamic and thermal environments. These exert pro-
found infl uence on the melting and dissolution kinetics of an alloying addition deter-
mining the latter’s effi ciency of utilization. Knowledge of a subsurface trajectory and 
immersion times of solids in steel melt is important and provides useful information 
on the kinetics of ferroalloy addition.

are shown schematically in Figure 6.1. In the context of a rigid bubble rising through

The drag forces, as seen from the above, depend on the relative velocity between 
particle and liquid such as urel, vrel, and wrel and it is through these the fl uid’s motion 
in the vessel exerts infl uence on the subsurface trajectory of the particle. The instan-
taneous drag coeffi cient, CD in Equations 6.2 through 6.4, is a function of Reynolds 
number and is determined from an appropriate Reynolds number–drag coeffi cient 
relationship. The Reynolds number is based on the particle’s instantaneous, absolute 
relative velocity, |U
→ rel|. Similarly, CA is the added mass coeffi cient and is assigned to 
0.5 for a spherical-shaped object.
Given the velocity of liquid, drag, and added mass coeffi cients, the following 
conditions defi ne Equations 6.2 through 6.7 completely, i.e.,
 (i) t = 0 and z = 0, us = Uent,z
 (ii) t = 0 and y = Yent, vs = Vent,y (0 for vertical entry)
 (iii) t = 0 and x = Xent, ws = Went,x (0 for vertical entry)
These necessitate that the entry locations and velocity are known a priori. A fi rst-
hand estimate of the velocity with which a solid enters the steel melt is deduced 
from an equation of free fall considering the actual height of fall =

. Such 
estimates are further modifi ed considering momentum redistribution at the impact 
zone. Accordingly, a more realistic prescription of solid’s entry velocity, say, along 
the z-direction, is given by

Equation 6.8 allows for slowing of the particle due to the added mass effect at the 
moment of impact. The dependence of the drag coeffi cient on the particle’s velocity 
as well as the nature of the drag force term make the trajectory equations nonlin-
ear and rarely therefore amenable to analytical solution.* A numerical method for 
simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations (i.e., Runge–Kutta, Adams–
Moulton methods, etc.) is required to solve the trajectory equations. An algorithm is 
suggested in Figure 6.2 and is based on the following assumptions:
 
1. Liquid fl ow and particle motion are three dimensional (3-D). The distribu-
tion of fl ow within the system is known a priori.
 
2. The addition is spherical in shape and an appropriate drag law is available.
* Considering a unique drag coeffi cient, CD (∼0.4, normally valid for high Reynolds number fl ow) and 
an otherwise stagnant melt, an exact solution of the particle trajectory equation is possible for vertical 
entry condition.

Diverse aspects of alloy addition kinetics have been investigated over the years by

solid additions in stagnant melts, during furnace tapping and gas injection operations 
was predicted following essentially an approach outlined above. Attempts were also 
made to validate model predictions against results derived from equivalent water

the general adequacy of the model study program. From a steelmaker’s point of view, 
such results indicate that neutrally buoyant additions penetrate deep inside the bath 
and are likely to be carried upward by the rising action of the upwelling plume. In 
contrast, heavier additions settle directly at the bottom of the vessel. These together 
with equivalent results for different size and solid–liquid density ratio provide useful 
insight into the behavior of alloying additions in steelmaking units.
6.3 MELTING AND DISSOLUTION OF SOLID
The addition of alloying elements and deoxidizers to liquid steel baths for adjusting 
steel chemistry to required specifi cations is a common practice in steelmaking. In 
today’s steel works, while deoxidizer additions are made during tapping of molten 
steel from a BOF/electric arc furnace (EAF) to a ladle, alloying additions on the 
other hand are typically carried during subsequent ladle metallurgy steelmaking 
operations. Huge amounts of deoxidizer and alloying additions are used up on a daily 
basis on the shop fl oor as large tonnage and various grades of steels are produced. 
The manner in which such additions melt, dissolve, and disperse within the melt 
exerts considerable infl uence on steel chemistry, cleanliness, and the overall process 
economics (i.e., through their effi ciency of utilization).
Solids projected into a steel bath either melt or dissolve depending on their melt-
ing points. Additions having melting temperature less than the characteristic steel-
making temperature, generally taken to be 1873 K, melt, while those having melting 
points greater than 1873 K dissolve in steel [4]. The former class of additions is gen-
erally referred to as class I ferroalloys. Typical examples include various deoxidizer 
and alloying additions such as Al, FeMn, FeSi, Fe–Cr, etc. In the latter category, 
primarily C, FeMo, FeW, FeNb, etc. are included.
As a class I ferroalloy, initially at room temperature, is projected into a steel 
bath, heat from the melt fl ows to the cold solid raising the temperature of the latter 
progressively up to its melting temperature. Subsequently, the molten alloy dissolves 
into steel to take part in various chemical reactions. From room temperature to its 
melting point, a class I ferroalloy can normally follow any of the three possible melt-
ing routes depicted in Figure 6.4a. Immediately following projection into the bath, 
a solidifi ed shell (of bulk liquid steel) forms around the solid. If the addition follows 
path 1, the solidifi ed shell melts back releasing the encased solid. In contrast, incipi-
ent or complete melting of the encased solid occurs in path 2 and therefore, once 
the shell melts back, a smaller size addition + molten alloy is released to the bath. 
The solid released through route 2a has a temperature lower than its melting point 
and hence continues to receive heat from the ambient to melt back completely. Unlike 
the initial stage, this later stage of melting of the solid is accompanied by no steel 
shell formation. The path that any given class I addition follows depends on the size 
of the additions, melt superheat, the thermophysical properties of the solid (i.e., spe-
cifi c heat, thermal conductivity, density), etc.
In the case of a class II ferroalloy, a solid steel shell originally forms around the 
cold solid. The shell melts back to release the heated solid in the melt. Thereafter 
heat transfer and dissolution occur simultaneously. With continual transfer of heat 
from the bath, the addition quickly attains a thermal equilibrium with the ambient,

i.e., molten steel. As the solid dissolves in liquid steel (primarily due to a difference 
in concentration or activity of the constituents in the solid and the liquid phases), its 
size progressively diminishes till the addition is completely dissolved into molten 
steel. This is shown in Figure 6.4. Melting temperatures and thermophysical proper-
ties of some typical deoxidizer/alloying additions together with their classifi cations 
are summarized in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, respectively.

6.3.1 MODELING OF MELTING AND PREDICTION OF COMPLETE MELTING TIME
Melting and dissolution in practice do not occur under stationary conditions. For 
example, additions as they are projected penetrate into the bath to move subsurface for 
some period of time. These typically melt and dissolve while in motion. Thus, addi-
tions are exposed to different thermal and hydrodynamic environments since fl ow and 
temperature vary from one location to another. These although do not alter the gross 
physical picture of melting depicted in Figure 6.4, exert some infl uences on the rates of 
melting and dissolution. If such effects are accommodated through appropriate trans-
port coeffi cients, the motion of solid and liquid becomes inconsequential to the predic-
tion of melting rates. Of course one can adapt an integrated approach and address the 
problem by coupling appropriate models of motion, melting, and dissolution.
Alloying additions in holding ladles during furnace tapping operations involve 
numerous complex processes (Figure 1.8). Therefore, in order to mathematically 
describe melting of various alloying additions in steelmaking furnaces, ladles, and 
so on, a fair amount of idealizations is frequently applied. Formulation of models in 
the following is based on the assumptions:
 
1. The melt is either stationary or moving; in the latter case the details of fl uid 
fl ow are known.
 
2. Geometry of the addition is spherical.
 
3. An appropriate convective heat transfer correlation is available* for the 
physical situation (viz., fl ow past a spherical geometry).
* The heat transfer correlations are geometry specifi c and available for spherical, cylindrical, or fl at 
plate geometries. For complex geometry and irregular shapes, such correlations often do not exist. To 
model a practical situation involving irregular solid geometry, the concept of an equivalent spherical/
cylindrical surface area, etc. has been applied. This represents a further simplifi cation in addition to 
those mentioned above.

fi lm temperature (i.e., an average of the melting and bulk temperatures). 
Similarly, thermophysical properties of the solid correspond to a tempera-

5. The melt temperature remains constant throughout the process and the solid 
follows the melting path 1a, as shown in Figure 6.4.
 
6. Initial entry effects are ignored and the solid is assumed to be essentially 
stationary in the liquid.
While convection from the melt brings heat to the solid–liquid interface through 
the boundary layer, heat fl ows within the solid by pure conduction. Similarly, with 
the progress of melting, the size of addition continuously changes as does the tem-
perature within the solid, making melting and transport of heat essentially unsteady. 
Invoking symmetry along θ and φ, the fl ow of heat within the solid can be conve-
niently described in terms of a 1-D, unsteady, heat conduction equation expressed in 
a spherical coordinate system as

The fi rst condition implies that prior to its immersion in to the steel melt, the tem-

second boundary condition states that at the surface of the solid R(t) (the radius R 
is time dependent), the temperature is the same as the melting temperature of the 
solid (crust material or the alloy). Finally, the third condition refl ects symmetry and 
essentially indicates that the gradient of temperature (or fl ux of heat) vanishes at 
r = 0. These indicate that an additional equation or expression is needed to defi ne the 
problem completely, as an additional unknown, R(t) is introduced to formulate the

It is through this latter parameter, the infl uence of motion of both solid and liquid on 
heat transfer/melting is accounted for. An initial condition on R(t) is now needed to 
complete the statement of the problem† and is
 (iv) t = 0, R(t) = Ri
In the presence of a given velocity fi eld (i.e., assumption 1), the key task is to obtain 
heat transfer coeffi cient, hc, from an appropriate forced convective heat transfer cor-
relation and thereby calculate instantaneous radius as a function of time (equivalent 
to melting rate) by solving equations (Equations 6.9 and 6.10). While specifi c cor-
relations exist for various fl ow geometry and common fl uids such as air, water, etc., 
equivalent correlations for liquid metal systems are rare. Metallic melts have sub-
stantially different Prandtl number (PrSteel = 0.197, PrAl = 0.014, PrNa = 0.004) than 
those of air (=0.71), water (=6.58), etc. and this is important in boundary layer heat 
transfer phenomena. A correlation derived empirically from melting of spherical-

* The melting point of the interface in question is not a constant and depends on whether the interface is 
between crust and the bath (during shell formation and shell melt back) or the alloy and the bath (dur-
ing melting of the alloy).
† The present formulation, as a fi rst approximation, ignores any incipient fusion of the solid addition 
within the steel shell or crust. Possible thermal resistance between the alloying addition and the solidi-
fi ed shell is also not accounted for in the formulation. Their incorporation in a similar heat fl ow model 
is outlined later in the context of industrial wire feeding operation.
  

Mathematical Modeling II: Liquid-State Processing Operations

In Equation 6.12, µb and µo are, respectively, the viscosity of the liquid at the bulk 
and mean fi lm temperatures.
For a given set of operating conditions, Reynolds number is known from the prev-
alent velocity. Therefore, Nussselt number and hence heat transfer coeffi cient are 
readily estimated from Equation 6.11 or Equation 6.12. On that basis, instantaneous 
radius or melting rates of the solid can be predicted from Equations 6.9 and 6.10, 
respectively. The governing equations together with the initial and boundary condi-
tions defy analytical solution and therefore, these are required to be solved numeri-
cally. A calculation scheme is suggested in Figure 6.5.
The approach described above has been adopted by numerous investigators to 
mathematically model melting phenomena. A typical computational result [7] for 
melting of an aluminum sphere in a molten aluminum bath is shown in Figure 6.6 
in which the variation of instantaneous radius as a function of time is shown. This 
indicates that immediately upon contact with the melt (i.e., t ≥ t0+), the radius of 
the solid increases due to the formation of a solidifi ed crust around the cold solid. 
The crust or the shell grows rapidly attaining a maximum thickness within the 
fi rst few seconds. In the subsequent 2 s or so, the shell melts back, releasing the 
original aluminum sphere in the melt. After about 10 s or so, the aluminum sphere 
(Ri = 12.5 mm) melts completely in the bath. The period of shell formation and melt 
back, as shown, is relatively a small fraction of the total melting time. In the same 
fi gure, measured instantaneous radius at several instants has been superimposed to

Despite the simplicity of formulation and a constant heat transfer coeffi cient,* a close 
agreement between the two is readily apparent.

Alternatively, considering hc a function of the characteristic length (i.e., the diameter 
of the solid), Equations 6.13 and Equation 6.11 or 6.12 are to be solved simultaneously 
to obtain instantaneous radius. One can solve the problem analytically, substituting 
hc in terms of R(t) (deduced from a heat transfer correlation) in Equation 6.13.
Complete melting time of an addition can also be approximated from a macro-
scopic standpoint, if shell formation and melt back are entirely ignored. Thus on the 
basis of a constant heat transfer coeffi cient and initial surface area of the sphere, one 
can set up the following heat balance equation:

In Equation 6.17, ∆HTot is the total enthalpy and is equivalent to the sum of sensible 
and latent heat of melting, i.e., MsCP(TM,alloy − Ti ) + ∆H. It is to be noted that while 
the differential model predicts a complete melting time of about 10 s for a 25.4 mm 
diameter aluminum sphere (Figure 6.6), the corresponding melting times estimated 
via Equations 6.15 and 6.17 are substantially smaller. This demonstrates that undue 
idealizations are accompanied by a substantial loss of accuracy of prediction [8]. 
Equivalent simplifi ed estimates are possible via Equation 6.17 in case of a solid shell 
formation by redefi ning temperature driving force (a function of the path followed by 
the solid addition) and ∆HTot appropriately. For example, assuming route 1b, the total 
enthalpy is MsCP(TM,bath − Ti ) + ∆H while the corresponding thermal driving force is 
(Tbath − TM,bath) (i.e., equivalent to bath superheat).
6.3.3 MODELING OF WIRE FEEDING OPERATION
Wire feeding is an important operation in steelmaking and is routinely practiced 
for introducing buoyant additions such as aluminum, calcium (in the form of CaSi 
or CaFe),* etc. into a steel bath. Typically, guided wires are injected at high speed 
(exceeding several m/s) into the steel bath. As the wire penetrates inside the bath, a 
solid steel shell (or, a mixture of steel-slag and liquid steel, since the wire has to pass 
through an initial layer of slag) forms around it. Subsequently, the shell melts back 
releasing the addition within the melt in a manner suggested via Figure 6.4a. The 
* While solid aluminum wires are commonly injected, Calcium in the form of CaSi or CaFe is used in 
powder form for their better effi ciency of utilization. The compacted powder is encased within a metal-
lic casing/sheath.
  

250 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
process parameters (i.e., wire diameter, speed of injection, bath superheat, etc.) are 
normally regulated in such a manner that the addition is discharged deep inside the 
vessel (in either liquid or gaseous state). This tends to promote better effi ciency of 
utilization of such buoyant additions by ensuring a relatively longer subsurface resi-
dence time. Thus, knowledge of the thermal profi le within the injected wire, from the 
moment it enters the molten steel bath is useful and help identify (1) the location where 
such additions are expected to be discharged within steelmaking vessels and (2) the 
state in which the wire is reexposed and the alloying additions released into the bath.
Figure 6.7a shows an industrial wire feeding operation in a ladle while Figure 
6.7b shows a typical cross section of the wire perpendicular to its axis at any instant 
following its injection into the bath [9]. The latter shows casing around the wire as 
well as solidifi ed crust of bath material freezing around it. In order to mathematically 
describe the temperature fi eld within the injected wire, the following idealizations 
and approximations are generally made.
 
1. The initial transients are ignored. Wire injection is considered under steady 
state condition.
 
2. The injected wire is cylindrical in shape and heat fl ow is symmetrical about θ.
 
3. The speed of injection is relatively large and therefore, bulk wire movement 
constitutes the dominant mechanism of heat transfer along the axial direc-
tion (i.e., bulk axial convective transport of heat within the wire is more 
important than corresponding conduction).
 
4. The encased material is solid.
 
5. The interfaces between the casing and the encased material as well as the 
solidifi ed crust and casing have fi nite contact resistances which are known 
a priori.

6. The material that solidifi es around the wire upon its entry into the bath is 
steel (i.e., the bulk liquid).
 
7. Melt temperature and hence thermophysical properties of melt are 
constant.
 
8. Density and specifi c heat of the solid are constant.
Temperature distribution with the wire is not known and is governed by the speed 
of injection, bath superheat, thermophysical properties of the solid, and so on. 
Therefore, the melting route the wire is likely to follow is not known a priori. It may 
be recalled here that in Section 6.3.1, a melting route was preimposed and the model 
developed. In this section, no such presumption is made; rather the model is formu-
lated considering various possibilities that might exist during the process. These are 
described below.
Case I: No internal melting and the solid–liquid interface is at the melting tem-
perature of the characteristic solid.

Noting that axial distance and injection velocity are uniquely related to the elapsed 
time (i.e., vw = z/t), the preceding equation is transformed in the following well-
known form with respect to a frame of reference moving along with the wire, i.e.,

* Within the body of an alloying addition, particularly when compounds are used, chemical reactions,

and are required to be accounted for realistic simulation via the heat source term. Microexothermicity, 
for example, is deliberately introduced (through addition of suitable elements/compounds) to expedite 
melting of certain class of ferroalloys.

The applicable initial condition to Equation 6.20 is

In addition to the above, the following constraints are to be respected since the inter-
face between the solidifi ed shell and the wire casing is imperfect and associated with 
fi nite thermal resistance. Between the shell growth and the melt back period (i.e., 
0 < t ≤ tshell,melt) therefore, the following requirement must be fulfi lled at the solidifi ed

In the two preceding equations, various ∆T * are the representative temperature dif-
ferentials across the respective interfaces while RT’s are their associated contact 
resistances. Since the contact/thermal resistances are assumed to be known, the 
governing equation together with the boundary condition presented above defi ne 
the problem completely. Note that Equations 6.21 and 6.22 are valid so long as the 
material on either side of the interface is solid and hence these hold good for a cer-
tain period of time. Barring such considerations, the formulation presented above is 
essentially identical to those presented in Section 6.3.1 earlier.
Case II: No internal melting and the exposed solid surface is at a temperature that 
is lower than the characteristic melting temperature of the surface
In such a situation, the boundary condition (ii) is strictly valid for the dura-
tion encompassing the shell formation and melt back periods (i.e., 0 < t ≤ tshell,melt). 
Immediately after the shell melts back, the casing is exposed and is directly in con-
tact with the bath with a surface temperature that is smaller than its melting point. 
This requires the boundary condition (ii) presented above is split over two periods 
of time according to
 (ii.a) 0 < t ≤ tshell,melt, r = R(t), T = TM,bath and
 (ii.b) tshell,melt < t, r = R(t), qconv = hc(Tbath − Tc)
  

Mathematical Modeling II: Liquid-State Processing Operations 
253
The latter condition prevails till the time casing surface attains its melting tempera-
ture. Once this happens, boundary condition (ii.b) is disregarded for all subsequent 
times and replaced with a condition similar to (ii), with T = TM,c, i.e.,
 (ii.c) tc,melt < t, r = R(t), T = TM,c
If similar phenomena are encountered following the melting of the casing material, 
boundary conditions are to be adjusted in the same manner.
Case III: Internal melting
Depending on the operating conditions, it is however possible that the casing or 
wire material reaches their melting temperature before the steel shell completely 
melts back. Such a situation poses additional complexity since two or more melting/
solidifi cation fronts are involved simultaneously. At the bath–solid interface, while 
boundary conditions can continue to be prescribed in accordance with either case I 
or case II, the following additional constraints are required to be satisfi ed to accom-
modate internal melting phenomena. Thus, once the temperature of an internal point 
reaches its melting, the temperature at such a location is maintained till enough heat 
is gained by the point so as to compensate the associated latent heat of fusion. In the 
case of melting of casing material before the complete melting of the steel shell, this 
is mathematically expressed as

Subject to the initial condition, t = 0, Rc(t) = Rc,i, in which Rc,i is the initial radius of 
the casing material Thus once the temperature fi eld and the corresponding thermal 
gradients are known from the solution of the governing equations, i.e., Equations 
6.19 and 6.20, the preceding equation can be readily integrated to determine the 
position of the casing surface as a function of time during its premature melting. As 
internal melting occurs, the contact resistance improves and thus Equations 6.21 and 
6.22, etc. can be ignored. To model heat fl ow within a domain that constitutes both 
solid and liquid, it is necessary to make one more idealization, i.e., the encased liquid 
is essentially stagnant.
A prescription of heat transfer coeffi cient, hc, is needed for a closure. This is 
deduced from an applicable forced convective heat transfer correlation. The physical 
situation is analogous to axial fl ow past a cylinder.* A summary of heat and mass 
transfer correlations of relevance to melting and dissolution of solids is provided in 
Chapter 8 (see Table 8.5).
An approach essentially similar to the above was applied [9] to investigate 
 industrial-scale melting of a cored wire during injection into a steel bath. In 
this, depending on the fl ow regime, the following heat transfer correlations were 
applied, i.e.,

In Figure 6.8, predicted sequence of events [9] during injection of a cored wire into a 
140 ton steel ladle is shown for two distinct shell growth conditions, e.g., slag + steel vs. 
steel alone, at low and high bath superheats, respectively. These indicate that provided 
solidifi ed shell around the cored wire is due to freezing of only molten steel, melting is 
according to case I. In contrast, for a slag + steel layer freezing around the cored wire, the 
scenario is changed as internal melting commences, particularly at low superheat. Under 
such condition, case I in combination with case III dictate melting of the cored wire.
6.3.4  MODELING OF DISSOLUTION AND PREDICTION 
OF COMPLETE DISSOLUTION TIME
Additions having melting point higher than the bulk steel temperature dissolve 
into steel following the route b depicted in Figure 6.4. Initially, a solid crust forms 
around the solid and dissolution commences only after the shell melts back. Thermal 
events accompany dissolution and heat transfer remains operational till the solid 
attains a state of thermal equilibrium with the bulk liquid steel. Consequently, an 
exact analysis of dissolution necessitates simultaneous consideration of heat and 
mass transfer phenomena. Since thermal diffusivity is many orders of magnitude

larger than the mass diffusivity of alloy constituents in liquid steel,* it is legiti-
mate to address dissolution of solid alloying additions in isolation of heat transfer. 
A simplifi ed model of alloy dissolution can then be formulated embodying the 
following assumptions:
 
1. Dissolution is taking place under isothermal condition, i.e., the solid is 
essentially in thermal equilibrium with the bulk steel.
 
2. The solid is stationary. The melt may or may not be moving. Furthermore, 
if former is the case, the fl ow fi eld is known.
 
3. The geometry of addition is spherical.
 
4. An appropriate convective mass transfer correlation exists for the physical 
situation (viz., fl ow past a spherical geometry).
 
5. Melt temperature is constant and accordingly, the thermophysical proper-
ties of liquid are invariant.
 
6. Dissolution is controlled by the rate of mass transfer across the concentra-
tion boundary layer.

chemical equilibrium prevails at the interface. As a consequence of such, surface concentration can be 
assumed to be equal to the saturation concentration.

Equation 6.28 is similar to the classical Ranz–Marshal correlation [10] but accom-

site to the estimation of mass transfer coeffi cient in the system.
Given the Reynolds number and the intensity of turbulence, the mass transfer 
coeffi cient, km, is readily estimated via Equation 6.28. Embodying that, the rate of 
dissolution and complete dissolution times can be predicted via Equation 6.27. A 
straightforward analytical solution is possible if Reynolds and Sherwood numbers 
are estimated on the basis of the initial rather than the instantaneous object radius/
diameter. Thus, on the basis of a constant mass transfer coeffi cient and negligible 
bulk concentration* of the dissolving species, Equation 6.27 is readily integrated

Model predictions for various argon fl ow rates are shown in Figure 6.9 in which 
variation of instantaneous radius as a function of time is illustrated. There, predicted 
dissolution times are of the order of 900–2000 s and these, as one would note, are sub-
stantially longer than the shell formation and melt-back periods, pointed out earlier. 
* The bulk concentration in reality is nonzero and is a function of time (i.e., with the progress of dis-
solution, the concentration of the dissolving species in the bulk increases). Rigorously speaking the 
dissolution process is therefore unsteady. The analytical treatment presented in this section is valid for 
the quasisteady situation only.
† In this, fl ow fi eld associated with gas injection is calculated via a turbulent fl ow calculation procedure. 
Based on such, Reynolds number and hence, mass transfer coeffi cient, km are estimated.

Such estimates indicate that any increase in argon fl ow rate expedites dissolution and 
cuts down complete dissolution time considerably.
6.4  THERMAL ENERGY TRANSPORT AND 
TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION
Temperature of steel melt is an important process parameter and is commonly regu-
lated within a narrow, desirable range practically at all stages of steelmaking. More 
than the required melt temperature increases operational hazards and energy consump-
tion, reduces thermal effi ciency, affects refractory performance, and so on. Similarly, 
less than a critical melt temperature impairs process kinetics, causes premature freez-
ing reducing yield, and so on. Owing to its overwhelming impact, melt temperature is 
mandatorily monitored at regular intervals during steelmaking. To this end, immersion 
thermocouples are applied in conjunction with suitable expert systems. This is generally 
adequate and provides reasonable estimates of a representative temperature, particularly 
in a well-stirred bath. It is however signifi cantly more diffi cult to determine the extent of 
temperature inhomogeneity in a melt or temperature at a specifi c location deep inside a 
bath through such a point-measuring device. Comprehensive information of melt tem-
perature, which is diffi cult experimentally, is often needed to address the following:
 
1. Free convection fl ows
 
2. Final melt superheat prior to casting
 
3. Chemical reactions such as postcombustion, etc. wherein rate depends 
overwhelmingly on temperature
 
4. Temperature-dependent thermophysical properties such as density, viscos-
ity, thermal conductivity, and so on

Substituting Lc = 1.042 m, Uc = 0.07 m/s (cross-sectional average velocity), g = 9.81 m/s2, 
and ρ ∼− 7000 kg/m3 (density at 1873 K) the ratio of

to 0.25∆T. Thus, a small temperature difference to the extent of 5 or 10 K is likely to

6.4.1 MODELING OF TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN STEEL MELT
Transport of heat in a fl owing liquid is due to the combined action of bulk and turbu-
lent convection as well as heat conduction phenomena. Temperature distribution in 
steel melts is therefore mathematically modeled via a turbulent convection–diffusion 
equation. An expression for thermal energy balance in a fl ow system is presented 
below embodying the following assumptions:
 
1. Heat transfer is transient, 3-D, and turbulent
 
2. The fl ow geometry is rectangular
The governing equation expressing the conservation of specifi c enthalpy, h is then 
represented in the Cartesian coordinate system as†

* Hydrodynamic conditions in steelmaking reactors vary considerably from one location to another. 
Therefore, in a rigorous sense, relative strength between free and forced convection would depend on 
the location under consideration. Despite such, an estimate of 
2
Gr/Re  as derived is useful and indicate 
as a distinct possibility that natural convection effect in steelmaking tundish systems is important 
particularly in the vicinity of sidewalls, due to small fl uid velocities and larger heat losses prevalent in 
those regions.
† Time-averaged equations are considered throughout the chapter in the context of the turbulent trans-
port. Accordingly, velocity, enthalpy, and temperature in Equations 6.32 and 6.33 are time averaged.
  

260 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
In Equation 6.33, λeff is the effective (molecular + turbulent) thermal diffusivity 
and is estimated from the theory of turbulence assuming an appropriate turbulent 
Prandtl number (Section 2.4.1.2).* Equation 6.33 is solved readily once the distribu-
tion of fl ow and turbulence parameters, i.e., vx,l, vy,l, vz,l, and λeff are known. These 
are obtained from Reynolds-average Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations and a RANS 
turbulence model, respectively. ST represents a volumetric heat source (W/m3) and 
accommodates various heat generation and dissipation effects in the system. These, 
for example, can include the following:
 
1. Endothermic and exothermic processes associated with various chemical 
reactions
 
2. Thermal effects due to melting and dissolution of deoxidizer elements, 
alloying additions, etc.
 
3. Thermal losses due to interaction with a secondary phase (i.e., injected gas)
 
4. Electrical heating as in a ladle furnace, tundish, and so on
Individual processes 1 through 4 contribute to melt temperature changes dur-
ing various stages of steelmaking, by as much as 50–60 K and must therefore be 
accommodated in a heat fl ow model to realistically predict the melt temperature. 
To complete the statement of the problem, one initial and six boundary conditions 
are required on Equation 6.33. Initial condition is generally known. Customarily, a 
homogeneous temperature fi eld is prescribed within the entire volume of liquid† at 
time t = 0. Boundary conditions at the free surface and vessel walls are prescribed 
in terms of either known temperature or heat fl ux, though the latter is more fre-
quent. Successful modeling of melt temperature relies primarily on the adequacy 
of such empirical data. A compilation of surface heat fl ux relevant to steelmaking 
ladles and tundish is presented in Table 6.4. These are plant specifi c and there-
fore expected to be different from one practice to another. Reliable plant data, 
as one would note, is a prerequisite to thermal modeling of steelmaking systems. 
These are rarely available within the open literature and are needed for furnaces, 
torpedoes, casters, etc., if thermal fi elds in such systems are to be modeled with 
certainty.
Embodying Equation 6.33 together with boundary conditions shown in Table 6.4, 
many investigators have mathematically modeled temperature distribution in steel-
making ladles and tundishes. As a typical example, predicted isotherms on the cen-
tral vertical plane of a 35 ton single-strand slab-casting tundish [14] are shown in 
Figure 6.10. These indicate that the tundish is far from being thermally homoge-
neous and melt temperature drops noticeably between the shroud and the strand. 
To demonstrate the general adequacy of the model study programs further, a com-
parison between predicted and measured temperature at specifi c locations in two 
* The turbulent Prandtl number viz., (Prt = νt/αt; αt ≈ Kt/ρCP) is generally assumed to have a value lower 
than unity (∼0.7) for liquid steel system.

different industrial tundish systems [15] is shown in Figure 6.11. There, reasonable 
agreement between prediction and measurements is readily evident.
The overall rate of melt temperature increase or drop can be predicted relatively 
easily adapting a lumped parameter approach. For example, average rate of tempera-
ture increase or drop is reasonably approximated from

6.4.2  MODELING OF THERMAL ENERGY TRANSPORT AND TEMPERATURE 
DISTRIBUTION IN GAS–LIQUID, TWO-PHASE SYSTEM
In Section 6.4.1, a general methodology of modeling heat transfer in a fl owing homo-
geneous medium (i.e., a single-phase fl ow system) is presented. Occasionally, ther-
mal interactions between phases occur during refi ning as well as transfer operations 
and these infl uence temperature distribution in the melt phase. For example, inert gas 
such as argon injected into ladles, tundishes, and molds absorb heat from the sur-
rounding during their passage through the melt. Due to such, while the temperature 
of the gas increases (i.e., being a function of gas residence time and thermophysical 
properties of the gas), the melt temperature drops. Therefore, to predict temperature 
distribution in the melt phase, say during gas injection, temperatures of gas and 
liquid are to be simultaneously calculated considering the mutual exchange of heat 
between the phases. It is through appropriate interphase exchange terms, energy 
transfer between phases is formulated.
* Operating heat fl uxes through various surfaces determine this and are therefore required to quantify

In a two-phase gas-liquid turbulent fl ow system, transport of heat in either phase 
can be assumed to be primarily governed by bulk and turbulent convection as well as 
interphase heat exchange mechanisms. Consequently, for an unsteady, 3-D fl ow situ-
ation, the conservation of thermal energy in the liquid and gas phases is expressed in 
the Cartesian coordinate system in their time-averaged form according to

in which, Ag and Vg are the representative surface area and volume of the gas phase. 
Assuming a reasonable shape of gas phase in a volume element, e.g., spherical, spheri-
cal cap, etc., expressions for Ag and Vg are readily derived. The gas volume fraction, 
αg, is known from the hydrodynamic model while hc, the heat transfer coeffi cient, is 
obtained from an appropriate heat transfer correlation. Similarly, gas and liquid phase 
velocities, turbulent thermal diffusivity† appearing in the energy conservation equa-
tions are known a priori from their respective models (i.e., fl ow and turbulence models). 
Hence, the governing heat fl ow equations constitute a system of two equations and two 
unknowns, these being the liquid phase and gas phase temperatures, respectively.
* As the starting point, an elemental energy balance in a laminar fl ow system is carried out on each 
phase to derive the characteristic thermal energy balance equation. Subsequently, through time aver-
aging, equivalent turbulent version is derived. To arrive at the fi nal form, one makes further assump-
tions on compressibility, viscous dissipation, etc.
† Same value applies to both the phases (Section 5.3.2.3).
  

264 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
At each of the six physical boundaries (say, x = 0 and a; y = 0 and b, and z = 0 
and c), thermal boundary conditions are required on the gas and the liquid phases. 
In addition, two initial conditions are needed in the case of an unsteady problem. 
Therefore, altogether 14 conditions are required to complete the statement of the 
problem mathematically. Initial conditions correspond to the gas phase and the liq-
uid phase temperature distribution within the domain at time, t = 0. Toward these, 
an ambient temperature at the nozzle exit plane and a homogeneous melt tempera-
ture (typically 1873 K) generally suffi ce. Boundary conditions on Equations 6.35 and 
6.36 are similar to those considered in the Section 6.4.1. For the gas phase, although 
the same set of wall boundary conditions apply, a somewhat different condition is 
needed at the free surface. There, the rate of heat loss due to the escaping gas is equal 
to the rate at which heat is brought by gas bubbles. In addition, an equation of state 
is also needed.
Modeling and concurrent validation of thermal interactions between cold injected 
gas and molten steel has been rare. Computational results derived from argon-stirred 
ladles show large-scale interactions between gas and liquid to be restricted in and 
around the gas injection nozzle. Furthermore, melt temperature is not drastically 
affected due to gas injection. These are physically consistent with the overall picture 
of ladle refi ning as mass fl ow rates of gas are typically small.
6.5 TRANSPORT AND REMOVAL OF INCLUSION
Inclusions are foreign material, present invariably in the fi nal steel product in a wide 
range of size and composition. Inclusions are of diverse origin. For example, oxide 
and sulfi de inclusions in molten steel are due to chemical reactions of deoxidizing 
and desulfurizing agents with the dissolved oxygen and sulfur, respectively. These 
are referred to as endogenous inclusions. Other sources of inclusions are reoxida-
tion from the atmosphere during transfer operations, reaction with refractory lining 
material, mechanical erosion of refractory material, mold powder entrapment in con-
tinuous casting moulds, etc. The latter type is termed exogenous inclusions.
Inclusions, when present beyond a certain critical size, signifi cantly impair 
mechanical properties of steel and are therefore not desirable in fi nal steel products 
as far as possible. For example, maximum acceptable inclusion size in a cast slab 
used for production of sheet and thin strip is generally limited to 40 µm or smaller. 
Defi nition of steel cleanliness is continuously getting more and more stringent and 
therefore, the acceptable size and volume fractions of inclusions are getting smaller 
year by year. The control and removal of inclusions from steel melt are therefore the 
subject matter of paramount interest to steelmakers. Maximum efforts are directed 
toward improving melt cleanliness during the fi nal stages of steel processing, par-
ticularly in the tundish and the mold. Although inclusion population, composition, 
and size in steel products are routinely investigated in steel mills through micros-
copy, residual inclusion population and its size range in steel processing units are fre-
quently investigated parallelly through mathematical modeling. The latter efforts are 
concerned primarily with the removal and control of inclusion in steelmaking units.
Residual inclusion population and removal of inclusions from steel melt are math-
ematically modeled from the following two different standpoints

1. Population balance
 
2. Convection–diffusion
Both the approaches rely on a priori knowledge of fl ow and turbulence in the system. 
Flow calculation therefore precedes.
6.5.1 POPULATION BALANCE MODEL
The population of inclusions in steel melt changes with time as the inclusions are 
generated and removed from steel melt via a host of coexisting processes. The rate at 
which population of a given size inclusions “k” changes in the melt is dictated by the 
following conservation equation:

and their associated size ranges are generally known and diffi cult to determine from

important and allows us to quantify inclusion removal effi ciency of a given steel pro-

 is formulated on the basis of various mechanisms of inclusion removal 
and generation in the system. In steelmaking, the following generally contribute to 
the physical removal of inclusions:
 
1. Floatation to slag due to Stokes rising phenomenon
 
2. Contact and adhesion to the vessel walls
 
3. Floatation aided by gas bubbles in two-phase fl ow systems
These are illustrated schematically in Figure 6.12. Mechanisms 1 through 3 as well 
as the population of any given size inclusion in the melt are profoundly infl uenced 
by inclusion agglomeration due to stochastic collision between different particles.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
As the rise velocity of an inclusion is a function of its size, step 1 is expected to be 
infl uenced by inclusion size which changes dynamically in the system. Similarly, the 
population of a smaller size inclusion may continuously diminish due to the agglom-
eration process itself. Many such phenomena are yet not completely understood. 
Further complexity arises due to breakage of agglomerated clusters, which may at 
times locally dominate the agglomeration kinetics.
Floatation of inclusion:
The inclusions being lighter than steel have a natural tendency to rise and thereby 
fl oat up to the slag–metal interface. The rising velocity of an inclusion, given by the 
Stokes law, is represented as*

On the basis of the above, the rate of fl oatation of inclusions through a distance L 
is estimated. If ideal absorption conditions are assumed, the number of inclusions 
reaching the slag–metal interface can be assumed to be eliminated from the system. 
Inclusions are known to exhibit fi nite dwell time before being absorbed by the slag.
Adhesion of inclusions to vessel walls:
As inclusions move close to the solid refractory walls and come into contact with 
the same, these normally adhere to the wall provided the property of the solid wall 
is similar to the inclusion material. The adhesion process depends on the properties 
of the melt, the nature of fl uid fl ow in the vicinity of the wall, characteristics of the 
boundary layer, and so on. The effect of solid surface on inclusion population density 
is expressed via [19]:

* The inclusions are generally oxide particles which are not completely wetted by liquid steel. Therefore, 
Stokes terminal rise velocity expressions may not be entirely applicable to inclusions rising through 
the liquid steel. Due to nonwetting behavior, the rise velocity of such particles is however expected to 
be higher than those inferred on the basis of Equation 6.39.
  

Mathematical Modeling II: Liquid-State Processing Operations

This indicates that in order to estimate inclusion removal via wall adhesion, 
information on turbulence phenomena in the system is needed. Furthermore, con-
centration of particles in the vicinity of the solid surface is required in order to 
effectively apply Equation 6.41. On the basis of Kolomogorff’s length scale (i.e.,

Collision and agglomeration of inclusion:
A mathematical framework for collision and agglomeration is developed on the basis 
of a physical model of the associated processes. In the bulk of liquid steel, inclusions 
tend to move independently following a path that is dictated by their rise velocity 
as well as the melt fl ow, till a collision occurs. Upon contact, two inclusions are 
assumed to coalesce instantaneously to form a new inclusion. The resultant new 
inclusion rises with a higher velocity than its parents and is removed from the bath 
once it reaches the slag–metal interface or comes into contact with the solid refrac-
tory surface. Assuming (1) inclusions are spherical in size, (2) collisions are binary, 
and (3) collision radii are much smaller than the Kolomogorff’s length scale, the 
number of collisions per unit volume per unit time between two inclusions with size 
ri and rj is represented by [20]:

The rate constant β(ri : rj) depends on the nature of collision. Three possible modes 
of collision have been considered in the context of inclusion agglomeration. These 
are
 
1. Brownian collision
 
2. Stokes collision
 
3. Turbulent collision
The Brownian collision is due to the Brownian movement of the inclusions in the 
melt. The Stokes collision is due to the rising of inclusions in the melt which is dif-
ferent for different size inclusions. Faster moving inclusions collide with smaller 
ones to coalesce into bigger ones. Finally, because of the movement of turbulent 
eddies in steel melt, the inclusions collide with each other. The respective rate con-
stants are [21]

These indicate that inclusion size and density, stirring energy, viscosity, and density

The net rate of change of population of inclusions having a size “k” is governed

different mechanisms mentioned earlier. In the preceding consideration, each colli-
sion has been assumed to be successful leading to the production of a new particle 
with a size that is different from that of its parents. However each collision may not 
be successful and lead to a new agglomerated particle. This is particularly true of 
turbulent collisions. Therefore, a collision effi ciency factor is generally introduced in 
the analysis and rate of change of population of “k” size inclusions due to turbulent 
collision phenomena is expressed on the basis of Equation 6.47 as [21]

* The fi rst term is the birth rate while the second term is the death rate of k-size inclusions. The fi rst term 
is halved since collisions pairs are doubly counted for i and j. However, in the case where two particles 
having same size generate the k-size particle, the generation term need not be halved since the colli-
sion is unique. Similarly, the destruction term should be doubled in that case i = k. Such features are 
introduced into the population balance equation through the Kronecker’s delta function, which has the 
property δij = 1 for i = j and δij = 0 for i ≠ j.

In Equation 6.51, AH is the Hamaker constant (= 2.3 × 10−20 J). By force fi tting experi-
mental data with calculation, αc is found to have a value of 0.18 for fl oatation of 
alumina inclusions in a steelmaking tundish system. For other systems, different 
coagulation coeffi cients might be necessary. In addition, population balance expres-
sions must always satisfy the underlying mass balance and hence an additional 
constraint such as,

 is to be respected. Furthermore coagulation process 
cannot infi nitely continue and hence a maximum permissible size is required to be 
imposed on the simulation. This may be constrained either by the eddy size or mea-
sured maximum inclusion size in the system.
Apart from the mechanism described above, inclusions are removed from steel 
melts via bubbles, particularly during gas injection operations. This is recog-
nized well within the steel manufacturing community and has contributed to the 
development of specifi c gas injection techniques in a steelmaking tundish. The 
adhesion of inclusion to bubble surfaces is governed by various forces such as 
capillary, buoyant, and pressure forces. Contact angle and interfacial tensions are 
also important and thus the specifi c nature of inclusion surface plays an important 
role in their attachment on to the bubble surface. Inclusion can adhere to a bubble 
surface as a single particle or clusters/layer of particles depending on the relative 
magnitude of interparticle cohesive forces and adhesive forces between inclusion 
and bubble surface. Complex physical processes are involved as inclusions attach 
themselves to a rising bubble and get removed. Estimation of bubble population 
and their size distribution are prerequisites to such efforts since relevant contact 
surface area is needed. Similarly, breakup of inclusion clusters which can occur 
under certain conditions complicate the modeling of birth and death rate of inclu-
sions further. Reliable rate expressions accommodating all such features are yet 
to be formulated.
Therefore, a generalized expression representing the net rate of change of number 
of a particular size inclusion, k, due to various events can now be developed on the 
basis of Equations 6.40, 6.42, and 6.48 and represented as

Similar equations are formulated for all the plausible size ranges. These lead to a

in which Snk is the net volumetric source term [(m3s)−1] and embodies generation and 
destruction of k-size inclusions within the bulk of the liquid due to physical processes 
such as, birth and death due to coalescence, etc. It is readily apparent that a large 
number of such conservation equations, each specifi c to particular inclusion size, are 
needed to obtain a statistically adequate, instantaneous distribution of different size 
inclusions in the melt. Accordingly, the combined fl uid fl ow and population balance 
approach entails a major computational task.* Equation 6.53 necessitates a priori 
distribution of fl ow and turbulence in the system.
An expression for the volumetric source term together with the initial and bound-
ary conditions are now needed to complete the statement of the problem. With 
reference to a steelmaking tundish system, the latter are illustrated in Figure 6.13. 
Floatation to the free surface and subsequent removal as well as wall adhesions pro-
cesses are accommodated in the model via boundary conditions while coalescence, 
etc. through the volumetric source term. The former mechanisms are operative in 
the vicinity of free surfaces and walls while the latter is important within the bulk of

results within a reasonable time frame.

the liquid. Therefore, we can apply Equation 6.48 to represent the volumetric source 
term Snk in Equation 6.53. Floatation and adhesion fl uxes prevalent at the free surface 
and solid walls can also be prescribed through Equations 6.40 and 6.42, respectively, 
and applied as boundary conditions to Equation 6.53. In addition, boundary condi-
tions at the inlet and the outlet are required. For example, the net outfl ow of inclusion 
is expressed in terms of outlet velocity, outlet area, and inclusion concentration in the 
immediate vicinity of the outlet as

Corresponding condition at the inlet is prescribed in a similar manner in terms of 
the incoming velocity and an appropriate incoming number density as well as dis-
tribution. A suitable size distribution can be assumed or alternatively, a normal-
ized number density is applied. In addition, the solution of Equation 6.53 requires 
an initial condition on the distribution of k-size inclusions in the system at time 
t = 0. A precise knowledge of this is neither possible nor required to model inclusion 
removal effi ciency of steelmaking systems.
Owing to the practical importance of the subject, numerous model studies of 
inclusion population distribution in different steelmaking systems such as tundishes, 
molds, etc. have been carried out and reported in the literature. In these, both the 
modeling approaches have been applied. For example, Zhang and coworkers [21] cal-
culated the number density of various size inclusions in a steelmaking tundish system 
via Equation 6.52 considering a size range between 1 and 75 µm. In their study, an 
experimentally determined initial distribution of inclusion was embodied to arrive 
at the fi nal population density. Population distribution calculation was preceded by a 
turbulent fl ow simulation to estimate rate constants associated with turbulence colli-
sion and wall adhesion processes. In Figure 6.14a, a comparison between predicted 
and metallographically determined inclusion population is illustrated. Despite many 
simplifying assumptions and inherent limitation of the optical metallographic tech-
nique, a reasonable agreement between the two is evident. Similarly, in Figure 6.14b, 
the contribution of fl oatation and wall adhesion on inclusion removal is shown 
for two different confi gurations of a steelmaking tundish [20]. This indicates that fl oata-
tion constitutes the dominant mechanism of inclusion removal in such systems and the 
overall removal effi ciency is improved in the presence of fl ow control devices.
6.6 BUBBLE POPULATION BALANCE MODEL
In the computational fl uid dynamic analysis of two-phase, gas–liquid fl ows discussed 
in Section 5.3.2, mono-size dispersed phase approximation has been applied, i.e., gas 
bubbles are of the same size and shape. In reality, a wide spectrum of bubble size 
and shape exists in a two-phase fl ow and is established in a dynamic manner due 
to bubble coalescence and breakup phenomena. In dispersed gas–liquid fl ows, the 
bubble size distribution plays important roles in the phase structure and interphase 
forces which in turn determine the multiphase hydrodynamic behaviors including 
the spatial profi les of gas fraction, gas and liquid velocities, mixing and mass transfer

behaviors. The population balance model (PBM) is an effective method to simu-
late bubble size distribution in two-phase fl ows since suffi ciently reliable models for 
bubble breakup and coalescence exist within the framework of population balance. 
Coupling the PBM with a computational fl uid dynamics simulation, is a more realis-
tic approach for modeling of gas injection into steel melts.

Furthermore, τ–  is the coalescence time and t is the contact time. The ratio between 
the two provides a fi rst indication whether coalescence will occur. Expressions of 
coalescence effi ciency and coalescence time are derived from modeling of thin-
ning of liquid fi lm between bubbles and are available in the literature* [23]. Similar 
to inclusion coalescence considerations presented earlier, the birth rate of size “i” 
bubbles due to coalescence of size “j” and size “k” bubbles (considering coalescence

in which g(ri) is the associated rate constant for the process, Dbr,i. Thus given the fl ow 
and turbulence parameter distribution in the domain, the net source term in Equation 
6.58 is estimated on the basis of the various rate constants. Constraints on the maxi-
mum and minimum plausible bubble size, bubble volume and number are required 
to formulate the fi nal model equation. The bubble (or gas) velocity, turbulence and 
gas volume fraction distribution, etc. are obtained from a separate computational 
fl uid dynamics simulation* such as those described in Section 5.3.2. On that basis, 
Equation 6.58 is solved to obtain the gi fi eld and the size distribution of the dispersed 
phase is thus established and therefrom, the Sauter mean diameter† is calculated. The 
distribution of drag forces between the two phases (i.e., the interphase momentum 
exchange) and the overall gas volume fraction are fi nally estimated on the basis of 
Sauter mean diameter and the two-phase fl ow model equations solved to yield a new 
set of bubble (gas), liquid velocities, turbulence, etc.
The continuous and the dispersed phase fl ow equations as well as the bubble PBM 
are mutually coupled. In this approach, apart from the continuous and dispersed 
phase equations of motion, one is essentially concerned with the solution of N + 1 
set of continuity equations, in which N is the number of bubble size ranges. Once 
the distribution of N − 1 size ranges is computed from N − 1 partial differential 
* In PBM, one set of momentum equations represent the velocity of bubbles (or the gas). This is rep-
resentative of the Sauter mean diameter. Rarely, momentum equations for all individual size ranges 
are solved. However, continuity equations for each individual size group are retained and solved to 
obtain the bubble size distribution. With such an approach, it is possible to consider a larger number 
of size groups and thereby provide a more realistic picture of bubble size distribution, gas volume 
fraction, etc.

Initial and boundary conditions to Equation 6.58 include an initial null fi eld and 
a prescribed gi at the gas fl ow inlet. At the wall, while a zero fl ux condition apply, at 
the free surface an outfl ow-type condition, similar to Equation 6.54 is imposed. In 
addition, overall gas volume fraction is prescribed at the fl ow inlet. This is accom-
plished by respecting the overall continuity, i.e., volumetric gas injection rate. A 
calculation scheme is presented in Figure 6.15 to illustrate a computational fl uid 
dynamic calculation of bubble population distribution.
6.7 MASS TRANSFER AND MIXING
Alloying additions following their melting and dissolution dissolve in steel and dis-
perse to produce a melt of homogeneous composition. In the absence of any chemical 
reaction, dispersion is primarily governed by mass transport and is therefore aided 
by such phenomena as bulk and turbulent convection (or eddy diffusion) and molecu-
lar diffusion. While bulk convection and eddy diffusion collectively govern “macro-
mixing,” molecular diffusion on the other hand controls “micromixing.” Dispersion 
or mixing is essential. Otherwise chemical inhomogeneties occur and induce unac-
ceptable variations in fi nal product chemistry.
The rates of mass transfer within the bulk liquid also provide useful indication of the 
effi ciency of steelmaking since a vast majority of processing operations are transport 
controlled. Mixing time is frequently used as a criterion to assess chemical effi ciency. 
This is defi ned as the time required to attain a given degree (generally 95%) of bath

homogeneity. The time at which the above criterion is met is customarily termed as 
the 95% mixing time.* A short mixing time implies relatively rapid mass transfer (i.e., 
better chemical effi ciency) and hence better process performance. Apart from aiding 
in thermal, material, and particulate homogenization, mixing also enhances chemical 
reactions by bringing in reactants together and removing products from reaction sites.
6.7.1 MODELING OF MIXING AND ESTIMATION OF MIXING TIME
The governing equation of material mixing is formulated below embodying the fol-
lowing assumptions:
 
1. Mass transport is 3-D and transient; the concentration of the added species at 
any location changes with time till the system is chemically homogeneous.
 
2. Flow is turbulent and therefore, eddy diffusion, bulk convection, and 
molecular diffusion all operate in conjunction.
 
3. The prevalent turbulent fl ow fi eld is known.
 
4. There is no chemical reaction and hence, there is neither generation nor 
destruction of the added species.
 
5. There is no partitioning of the added species between the melt and the slag 
phases.
 
6. The system is isothermal and thermophysical properties are constant.
 
7. Properties of the added material are similar to those of the bulk.
 
8. The reactor geometry is cylindrical.
On the basis of the above, conservation of mass of an inert species “i” in a  cylindrical-
shaped vessel can therefore be expressed in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinate as

In Equation 6.65, vz,l, vr,l, and vθ,l are the three time-averaged components of liquid 
velocity.† Similarly, Deff is the effective diffusivity and is the sum of molecular and 
turbulent diffusivity (i.e., = D + Dt). The eddy or turbulent diffusivity is gener-
ally taken to be equal to eddy kinematic viscosity, vt (= µ t/ρ) or turbulent Schmidt 
number (Sct = vt/Dt) is unity. From the viewpoint of engineering  calculations, such 
approximations, i.e., Sct = 1, generally suffi ce.
Knowledge of fl ow and turbulence is a prerequisite to the solution of Equation 
6.65.‡ The fl ow and turbulence model equations are coupled one way with the species 
* Mixing times vary from one location to another in the system. From such a standpoint, mixing time 
registered from the slowest mixing region is more relevant since by the time the slowest mixing region 
is 95% mixed, liquid elsewhere is nearly perfectly mixed.
† Flow velocities and mass fraction in Equation 6.65 are time averaged.
‡ Transient fl ow conditions in steel processing vessels are generally short lived as many modeling stud-
ies have indicated. Consequently, mass transport is modeled via Equation 6.65 on the basis of steady 
fl ow and turbulence fi elds.

 conservation equation and therefore solved independent of the later.* Six boundary 
conditions and an initial condition are needed to complete the statement of the prob-
lem. As the species “i” cannot physically leave the domain (assuming there is no fl ow 
outlet), a zero fl ux condition applies to all bounding surfaces (i.e., walls, free surface, 
etc.). To this end, prescription of a zero concentration gradient (i.e.,

at such surfaces suffi ce since velocity normal to the boundary is zero. In addition, 
Equation 6.65 requires an appropriate initial condition on mi (generally a null or a 
homogeneous fi eld). An assigned mass fraction fi eld over a selected region is also 
applied for a short duration to simulate pulse addition of the species “i.”
Mixing in ladles, torpedoes, BOFs, etc. has been mathematically modeled by 
numerous investigators through numerical solution of Equation 6.65. As a typical 
example, predicted mass fraction contour on the principal central vertical plane of a 
dual plug-stirred ladle (viz., plugs at ±R/2 locations) is shown in Figure 6.16a–d [24] 
corresponding to four different instants of time. There, although the added material 
is seen to initially get caught up between the surfacing plumes, progressive mixing 
due to turbulent convection and diffusion is readily evident. Such results also suggest 
that mixing in large steel processing units is expected to be nonuniform. The regions 
* This is valid provided the added species “i” has mass density similar to that of the bulk liquid. For a 
different mass density of the added species, free convection effects assume importance. This makes 
fl ow, turbulence, and species conservation equations mutually coupled.

6.7.2 MODELING OF RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION
The species conservation equation together with a somewhat different set of initial 
and boundary conditions have been applied to investigate residence time distribution 
(RTD) [25] in a steelmaking tundish system. In a long sequence casting, except for 
the initial period of fi lling and the fi nal stages of emptying, a tundish is operated 
practically under steady state conditions. RTD characteristics of such a steady fl ow-
ing tundish system can be mathematically modeled by simulating pulse injection of 
an inert tracer into the shroud and computationally monitoring the concentration 
of the latter as a function of time at the tundish exit. The variation of mi(t) at the 
fl ow outlet thus obtained forms the basis of RTD and employed frequently to quan-
tify metallurgical performance of steelmaking tundish. A representative RTD curve 
(also known as a “C” curve) is shown schematically in Figure 6.17.
RTD calculation has been carried out through solution of the species conservation 
equation embodying the following assumptions, i.e.,
 
1. The fl ow is steady, turbulent,* isothermal, and 3-D
 
2. The slag layer above the melt is essentially quiescent and does not interfere 
with the fl ow in tundish
 
3. Thermophysical properties of the bulk liquid are constant
* Different regions in tundish are associated with markedly different level of turbulence. For example, 
while region close to the shroud is highly turbulent, far away, near the vicinity of sidewalls, the fl ows 
are remarkably sluggish. These make rigorous modeling of turbulence in tundish diffi cult.

The steady turbulent fl ow fi eld in tundish is estimated on the basis of the RANS 
equations together with a RANS turbulence model (i.e., k–ε turbulence model). 
Embodying such in Equation 6.66 the mi(x,y,z,t) fi eld is computed. To simulate pulse 
injection through the shroud (i.e., the fl ow inlet), a time-dependent boundary condi-
tion is applied by imposing a fi xed mass fraction at the inlet over the duration of 
injection. Beyond such time, fl ux of tracer through the inlet is set to zero. At the 
remaining boundaries, i.e., solid walls and free-surface, conditions similar to those 
mentioned in Section 6.7.1 are applied together with the standard outfl ow condition 
at the tundish exit. Initial condition to Equation 6.66 corresponds to a zero mass frac-
tion throughout the fl ow domain.
Numerous investigators have mathematically modeled RTD in different types of 
tundish (rectangular, delta, T-shaped, etc.) and many combinations of fl ow modi-
fi ers (dam, weir, pouring box, slotted baffl e, and so on) to primarily study hydro-
dynamic performance of steelmaking tundish system. Predicted mass fraction as a

On the basis of results presented in Figure 6.18, minimum breakthrough time,

mated and therefrom, proportions of dead (Vd), well-mixed (VM) and dispersed plug

portions of fl ow volumes thus estimated provide some indication on the metallurgi-
cal performance of tundish as a refi ning vessel. For example, presence of a relatively 
large proportion of well-mixed volume indicates adequate mixing in the melt phase 
and hence better material and heat transport. On the other hand, a large plug fl ow 
volume indicates better possibility of inclusion fl oat out. It is important to note that, 
phenomena such as inclusion population distribution, thermal energy transport, and 
overall hydrodynamic performance of steelmaking systems are better investigated 
directly from their respective conservation equations presented earlier.

Mixed or transition slab length produced from continuous casting during ladle change-
over or grade transition can be conveniently modeled via the species conservation

equation presented in the preceding sections. During continuous casting, as a teeming 
ladle is exhausted, a new ladle replaces the old one in the turret. During such change-
over, if the melt contained in the new ladle is of a different composition (or grade), a 
slab having an intermediate composition results.* The following sequence of opera-
tion is typical of mixed grade casting and the associated ladle changeover practice:
 
1. A ladle with melt composition C1 is continuously emptied at a predeter-
mined, steady rate into a tundish resulting in a constant bath depth.
 
2. The slide gate is partially closed once metal head in the ladle falls below 
a critical level. The casting continues, albeit at a somewhat reduced rate, 
resulting in a drop in the level of the melt in the tundish from its initial 
steady level.
 
3. The new ladle with melt composition C2 is brought in and metal is poured into 
tundish at the maximum possible rate. Casting is continued with a progres-
sively increasing pace as the unthrottled fl ow gradually increases bath depth. 
This results in a melt volume with a mixed composition, initiating production 
of a transition slab having an intermediate composition between C1 and C2.
As the liquid head in the tundish reaches its designated steady level, the fl ow rate 
through slide gate is readjusted to synchronize infl ow rate with the casting speed. 
This helps maintain a steady bath depth in the tundish. The production of transition 
slab however continues for some time and the slab composition gradually changes 
to that of the second ladle. The infl uence of ladle changeover on slab composition 
during continuous casting is illustrated schematically in Figure 6.19. Transition slab 
thus formed is often downgraded (i.e., rejected and recycled into BOF as scrap) and 
therefore, it is important to minimize the length of the transition slab during casting 
of mixed grades.
* Transition slab volume frequently results if the length of sequence is small. This is so as the same 
tundish is used to cast different grades of steel.

Hydrodynamics and mixing phenomena in a tundish vary signifi cantly with time 
during ladle changeover. As illustrated in Figure 6.19, fi ve characteristic time peri-
ods can be readily identifi ed during mixed grade casting, i.e.,
 (i) t ≤ 0; steady-state operation with a practically constant bath depth, incom-
ing fl ow, and outfl ow
 (ii) 0 < t ≤ t1; ladle is removed and hence there is no incoming fl ow; bath depth 
decreases as function of time and outfl ow is reduced, i.e., casting is contin-
ued at a reduced rate
 (iii) t1 < t ≤ t2; with increased incoming fl ow from the new ladle, bath depth is 
increased and mixing of residual and new liquid commences in the tundish
 (iv) t2 < t < t3; steady-state operation with a practically constant bath depth, 
incoming fl ow, and outfl ow. Progressively less-pronounced mixed liquid 
volume in the tundish and hence less mixed slab
 (v) t > t3; steady-state operation with new slab composition
These suggest that by manipulating the inlet boundary conditions and taking into 
account the changing bath depth through auxiliary models, the evolution of melt 
composition, i.e., mi(t) fi eld, and hence the effect of grade intermixing during ladle 
changeover can be modeled mathematically via Equation 6.66. A mathematical 
model of grade intermixing however differs from that of mixing and RTD on several 
counts. These are
 
1. During grade transition operation, species transport, fl ow, and turbulence 
fi elds evolve simultaneously with time. These warrant a fully transient sim-
ulation. Furthermore, fl ow, turbulence, and species conservation equations 
could be mutually coupled particularly if casting of drastically different 
grades are involved.
 
2. The inlet boundary conditions on fl ow, turbulence, and species transport 
equations are not unique but vary as a function of time.
 
3. The level of liquid in tundish fi rst decreases and subsequently increases 
with time as steady state is approached. Therefore, the domain of numerical 
computation changes at least for some time during ladle changeover.
Fully transient, 3-D models of fl ow, turbulence, and species conservation are there-
fore needed to simulate grade transition phenomena during ladle changeover. On the 
basis of discussion presented so far in Sections 6.7.1 and 6.7.2 we can conveniently 
formulate the governing equations together with their appropriate set of initial and 
boundary conditions. In addition, a suitable numerical scheme is needed to accom-
modate the infl uence of changing free surface/bath depth.
A variety of methods are available for the calculation of free-surface position and 
shape. These, for example, include
 
1. Lagrangian grid method
 
2. Marker and cell (MAC) method
 
3. Volume of fl uid (VOF) method
 
4. Height function or surface height method
  

284 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
The simplest means of defi ning and tracking a free surface is to construct a Lagrangian 
grid moving with the fl uid. Because the grid and fl uid move together, the grid auto-
matically tracks free surfaces. The MAC method is one of the earliest methods 
devised for time-dependent, free-surface fl ow problems. The scheme is based on a 
fi xed, Eulerian grid. The location of fl uid within the grid is determined by a set of 
marker particles that move with the fl uid, but otherwise have no volume, mass, or 
other properties. VOF method is based on the concept of a fl uid volume fraction. In 
this, free-surface shape is reconstructed on the basis of relative proportion of phase 
volumes. The procedure mimics the powerful volume-tracking feature of the MAC 
method.
Low-amplitude sloshing, shallow water waves, and other free-surface motions 
in which the surface does not deviate too far from horizontal are modeled reason-
ably well by the height function method. In this, the free surface is defi ned by its 
distance from a reference line as a function of position along the reference line. 
The time evolution of the height function, ℏ(x, y, t), is governed by a kinematic 
equation expressing the fact that the surface must move with the fl uid in accor-

in which vx,l, vy,l, and vz,l are, respectively, the three components of liquid fl ow along 
x, y, and z (vertical) directions. Three conditions on ℏ(x, y, t) are required. The 
condition at t = 0 corresponds to the unperturbed horizontal fl at free surface. For 
t > 0, two types of conditions are generally considered. In the fi rst, it is assumed 
that the free surface is pinned to the wall and hence unable to move. This is equiva-
lent to prescribing the value of ℏ at the boundary. In the second, the free surface 
is permitted to move, but the contact angle is assumed to be fi xed. This means that

surface that freely slips at the wall. A gamut of conditions that lie in between is pos-
sible. A calculation scheme for modeling of grade transition operation is presented 
in Figure 6.20.
Grade intermixing, due to its practical relevance, has been investigated exten-
sively by a different group of investigators. Many authors have mathematically mod-
eled grade transition phenomena during ladle changeover and substantiated their 
calculations against data derived from water models as well as full-scale casters. In 
Figure 6.21, one set of result [28] is shown in which numerically predicted species 
concentration at the tundish exit during grade transition is directly compared with 
equivalent measurements derived from an industrial continuous caster. Close agree-
ment between prediction and measurements evidently demonstrate the adequacy and 
appropriateness of such model study program.

6.8 MASS TRANSFER WITH CHEMICAL REACTION
Chemical reactions between different species occur frequently in steelmaking. 
Examples include C–O reaction in primary steelmaking, desulfurization in ladle 
metallurgy, removal of gases in degassing, and so on. The rate of such reactions often 
depends on transport of reactants and products to and from the reaction sites. Fluid 
motion therefore infl uences the rate of many steelmaking reactions. In such context, 
transport of heat is also important since chemical reactions produce or absorb heat. 
Consequently, modeling of mass transport with chemical reaction necessitates con-
current modeling of heat transfer and turbulent fl uid fl ow.
6.8.1 MODELING OF POSTCOMBUSTION
In primary steelmaking, dissolved oxygen and carbon react to produce carbon mon-
oxide (CO). The reaction is highly exothermic and releases chemical energy. The CO 
gas is further oxidized to CO2 by mixing with oxygen, before the former leaves the 
furnace. This is termed as postcombustion. CO2 thus produced releases about three 
times the energy released due to the oxidation of carbon to CO. The potential use of 
this energy as well as the attendant increase in productivity is the economic driving 
force behind postcombustion technology in steelmaking (both in BOF and EAF). An 
adequate postcombustion technology must meet the following objectives:
 
1. Effi cient and optimized injection of oxygen
 
2. Signifi cant energy transport to the melt or scrap
It is in such context mathematical modeling can provide useful insight and guidelines.
In Figure 6.22, a substantially idealized scenario of a BOF is presented to illus-
trate the evolution of CO from the melt and its concurrent oxidation to CO2 within

the upper atmosphere of the vessel. Considerable amount of agitation is present in the 
melt phase and this infl uences the rate of CO evolution, since the formation of the 
latter is controlled by mass transport in the melt phase. Rigorous modeling of post-
combustion therefore necessitate simultaneous prediction of fl uid fl ow, heat and 
mass transfer within the entire vessel comprising the melt and the upper gas phase 
such that CO evolution, CO2 generation, and heat energy release are predicted with 
reasonable certainty.* Alternatively, taking a simplistic stand and treating the melt as 
essentially stationary, postcombustion phenomena can be mathematically modeled 
relatively easily with a preimposed rate of CO generation. Such an approach sim-
plifi es the problem considerably since governing equations of fl ow, heat, and mass 
transfer are solved for the gas phase alone, i.e., within the upper atmosphere of the 
furnace. The various building blocks of the “idealized postcombustion model” are
 
1. Fluid fl ow: A 3-D, homogeneous turbulent fl ow model is required to rep-
resent fl ow phenomena within the upper gas phase. Due to nonuniform 
temperature as well as concentration differentials, temperature and com-
position-dependent thermophysical properties (viz., density, viscosity, ther-
mal conductivity, specifi c heat, etc.) are needed. A weight or mass average 
formulation is generally adopted to evaluate composition-dependent ther-
mophysical properties. Large variations in temperature tend to induce gas 
compressibility and this complicates modeling of postcombustion further.
 
2. Turbulence: Large rates of oxygen injection, CO evolution, etc. lead to 
intense stirring and help turbulent fl ow condition prevail in the upper part 
of the furnace. Accordingly, appropriate models are needed to account for 
the transport of heat, mass, and momentum due to turbulence.
 
3. Mass transfer with chemical reaction: Individual mass conservation equa-
tions are required for CO, O2, and CO2 in order to calculate their distribu-
tion, reaction rates, and heat evolution in the system. These are essentially 
convection–turbulent diffusion equations with a fi nite mass source/sink 
and have a form practically analogous to Equation 6.66. The rate of post-
combustion reaction (i.e., CO2 production) must be known a priori in order 
to represent species conservation equations in a closed form. The latter 
is determined from experimental measurements while the corresponding 
rates of CO and O2 depletion are estimated from stoichiometry.
 
4. Heat transfer: A single thermal energy conservation equation with a fi nite 
heat source (i.e., heat evolution due to the postcombustion reaction) can 
adequately describe the temperature fi eld within the upper atmosphere of 
the furnace. The governing heat fl ow equation is also of the convection–
turbulent diffusion type and has a form similar to Equation 6.32. Additional 
procedures are needed to accommodate radiative heat transfer between 
adjacent locations at different temperatures via area, radiation view factor, 
emissivity, etc.
* Detailed modeling of large-scale gas–slag–metal interactions in a BOF has been reported only recently 
[29]. Modeling of postcombustion phenomena from the fi rst principles is inherently complex.

6.8.1.1 Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions
The governing equations of fl ow and turbulence are essentially identical to those 
applicable to homogeneous turbulence fl ows (Section 5.3.1). However, to account 
for temperature- and composition-dependent properties, an equation of state, i.e., 
ρ = pW/RgT is required as a closure. The governing mass conservation equations for 
a species “i” (= CO, O2, and CO2) are represented under steady state, in vector nota-

In Equations 6.72 and 6.73, Deff and λeff are, respectively, the effective (molecular + 
turbulent) material and thermal diffusivities. These together with the fl ow, U
→
, are 
obtained from an appropriate turbulent fl ow model. The heat and mass source terms 
are prescribed a priori in order to represent these equations in their closed forms. 
Since thermophysical properties are composition- and temperature-dependent, fl ow 
and turbulence model equations are implicitly coupled with the mass and the thermal 
energy conservation equations. This implies simultaneous solution of fl ow, turbu-
lence, composition, and temperature fi elds.
To model steady, 3-D postcombustion phenomena such as the one considered here, 
we are concerned with the solution of altogether nine p.d.e.’s* describing the conser-
vation of mass, momentum, turbulence kinetic energy as well as dissipation, species 
conservation, and thermal energy. Altogether, 51 conditions are needed to complete 
the statement of the problem. Boundary conditions are prescribed on the following

known. Boundary conditions on species concentration and temperature at the 
stationary melt surface (assumed) are based on empirical data. Prescription of 
a constant temperature at the vessel wall as well as the melt surface seriously 
impairs the objective of modeling since the exact amount of postcombustion heat 
taken up by the walls and the melt is not computed and therefore, remains unde-
termined. Furthermore, predicted thermal and concentration fi elds are a strong 
function of the boundary conditions. The building blocks and a number of gov-
erning p.d.e’s together with their applicable set of boundary conditions are sum-
marized in Table 6.5.

Rigorous modeling of postcombustion in steelmaking furnaces supported adequately 
with industrial data is yet to be attempted. In one of the studies [30], postcombustion 
in an EAF was mathematically modeled adapting a simplifi ed approach, conceptu-
ally similar to the one outlined above. In this [30], CO was introduced into the fl ow

Incorporating these with a constant wall temperature of 1573 K and melt surface 
temperature of 1773 K, respectively, postcombustion in an EAF was mathematically 
modeled and fl ow, turbulence, species concentration, and temperature fi elds were 
calculated within the upper furnace atmosphere. Predicted mass fraction of various 
species along the axis of an injector is shown in Figure 6.23 as a function of distance 
from the injector exit. This indicates that oxygen concentration progressively dimin-
ishes from the injector tip and becomes practically zero in the vicinity of the bath 
surface. Such trends are consistent with the corresponding profi les of CO and CO2 
 suggesting essentially intense postcombustion reaction in the vicinity of the melt 
surface.
6.9 SOLIDIFICATION AND CONTINUOUS CASTING
Continuous casting is a heat extraction process in which superheat, heat of fusion, 
and sensible heat are rapidly removed from molten steel to transform the latter into 
a useful solid product. Solidifi cation initiates in the mold region, where circulating 
* Postcombustion reaction occurs within the entire upper atmosphere. In contrast, the de–PC reaction 
occurs at the phase boundary between the gas and the melt phases. The de–PC reaction is heteroge-
neous and is highly endothermic.

water removes heat from the solidifying steel via mold wall and is completed in 
the spray or secondary cooling zone, where air–water sprays impinging directly on 
the solidifi ed strand surface facilitates heat extraction. The manner in which heat is 
removed from a descending strand infl uences microstructure and segregation, sur-
face and internal cracks, bulging and breakouts, etc. determining largely the caster 
effi ciency and quality of steel. It is therefore important to regulate the heat extrac-
tion process during continuous casting in a predictive manner such that defect-free 
steel is produced with minimum interruptions. Many of the defects in continuously 
cast products such as surface and subsurface cracks, slag particle entrapment, etc. 
owe their origin to the mold and are related intricately to fl uid fl ow phenomena in 
the mold. For example, the surface standing waves which are strongly related to the 
throughput rate, submerged entry nozzle (SEN) design, etc. infl uence slag particle 
entrapment and hence cleanliness of steel. Coupled with controlled solidifi cation, 
it is equally important to regulate melt fl ow in continuous casting molds to ensure 
smooth, defect-free production of steel. Detailed knowledge of fl ow and temperature 
fi elds is therefore important and in such context, mathematical modeling provides 
useful insight and guidelines.
Fluid fl ow, heat transfer, and solidifi cation processes in continuous casting are 
interlinked with one another and therefore a fully coupled approach is needed for a 
thorough understanding and analysis. Simplifi ed approach exists and allows model-
ing of thermal and solidifi cation phenomena exclusive of fl uid fl ow. Both approaches 
are described in the following sections.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
6.9.1 EFFECTIVE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY MODEL
Many assumptions and idealizations are necessary to mathematically describe heat 
transfer and solidifi cation phenomena via the simple, effective thermal conductivity 
concept. These are
 
1. The effect of convection and turbulence on heat transfer within a  solidifying 
casting is accommodated by treating the latter as a “pseudosolid” having a 
relatively large thermal conductivity.
 
2. In the temperature range T > Tliquidus, the thermal conductivity of the “pseu-
dosolid” is at least 7–10 times larger [31] than thermal conductivity of solid 
steel.
 
3. Reciprocating movement of the mold, mechanical bending of the strand, 
etc. are inconsequential to heat transfer and solidifi cation phenomena.
 
4. Bulk motion of the descending strand constitutes the dominant mechanism 
of heat fl ow along the axial direction. Accordingly, conduction of heat along 
the axial direction is unimportant.
 
5. The meniscus is covered with slag and therefore, little or no heat is lost 
through the exposed surface
 
6. Density and specifi c heat are constant. Similarly, surface heat fl ux, heat 
transfer coeffi cient, and emissivity are known.
The generalized enthalpy balance within the descending strand in Figure 6.24 under 
steady state can be described in terms of the Cartesian coordinate system fi xed in 
space* as
* The control volume over which thermal energy conservation principle is applied is considered to 
be large enough with respect to the microstructure and small compared to the scale of temperature 
inhomogeneties.

The fi rst term on the left-hand side represents heat fl ow along the axial direction due 
to the bulk motion of the descending strand. In addition, appropriate heat convection 
and conduction terms appear along the three coordinate axes. ST is the  volumetric 
heat source and accommodates thermal effects associated with the solidifi cation 
phenomena.
In the effective thermal conductivity model, the net “convection + diffusion” fl ux 
of heat along each direction is represented via an equivalent conduction (or diffu-
sion) fl ux and an artifi cially enhanced thermal conductivity, Keff,a. For example, the 
net heat fl ux along z-direction is

* Generally, Keff,a = [Ks   fs+(1 − fs)K1][1+βo(1 − fs)2] [32]. No fi rm prescription exists on the enhancement 
factor, βo. This is ascertained by tuning model prediction against measurable quantities such as cast 
surface temperature, shell thickness, etc. [30].

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Equation 6.82 is analogous to a “transient, 3-D, heat conduction equation.”*
In the macroscopic modeling of solidifi cation phenomena, one generally ignores 
nucleation and growth, undercooling, etc. and assumes that the relationship between 
solid fraction, fs, and temperature, T, is not sensitive to such parameters as velocity 
of the interface. Therefore, the behavior of the function fs(T) is often deduced from a 
segregation model and the latent heat source is formulated as [33]

adjusting the value of specifi c heat CP in accordance with Equation 6.87 over the 
temperature range of interest and setting ST = 0 in Equation 6.82, the latent heat of 
solidifi cation can be conveniently accommodated in the calculation scheme.†
On the basis of local thermodynamic equilibrium and negligible curvature of 
liquidus and solidus, the mass fraction of liquid and the liquidus temperature are 
expressed [34] as
* Equation 6.80 suggests two competing heat transfer processes along the axial direction, z. These being 
the bulk transport due to the descending movement of the strand and the axial conduction. Even in a 
seemingly small volume element, the contribution of the former is substantially larger to axial fl ow of 
heat. As a result, the axial conduction of heat is often ignored in the analysis. This renders the govern-
ing heat fl ow equation parabolic in z, allowing a marching solution along z without having to prescribe 
a downstream boundary condition on temperature, T.
† The variable specifi c heat formulation exhibits discontinuities or strong variations at/close to peritectic 
temperature. Ensuring energy conservation under such situation, without specialized numerical con-
siderations, is diffi cult.

This implies that from the meniscus to the mold exit, heat fl ows signifi cantly faster 
via bulk convection. Even within a small control volume size of 0.01 m or so, the 
ratio is insignifi cantly small, i.e., ~0.017. Note that convection dominates over large 
distance of transport while diffusion operates at the molecular level. As the control 
volume size diminishes, the relative contribution of conduction becomes important.
In the above, w· is the spray cooling volume fl ux (m3/m2 s) and αs is a machine-
dependent calibration factor and depends on such parameters as the distribution and 
layout of sprays. To accommodate the effect of orientation, for the downward fac-
ing surface of the strand the spray heat transfer coeffi cient is modifi ed by multiplying 
Equation 6.90 by [1 − 0.15 cos ϕo], in which ϕo is the cast surface angle from horizon-
tal. This is based on empirical fi ndings that cooling of a downwardly facing surface 
is about 15% less relative to the upwardly facing surface. In the spray cooling zone, 
radiation + forced convection cooling conditions are applicable. On the other hand, 
in the radiation cooling zone, radiation + turbulent natural convection cooling condi-
tions are applicable. The turbulent natural heat transfer coeffi cient (in SI unit) can be 
deduced from [32]

6.9.2 CONJUGATE FLUID FLOW AND HEAT TRANSFER MODEL
The effective thermal conductivity model of continuous casting avoids fl ow calcula-
tion within the solidifying strand and instead solves conductions like equation to 
simulate thermal and solidifi cation phenomena. The fl ow is important, particularly 
within the mold region and exerts infl uence on
 
1. Entrapment of mold powder
 
2. Floatation of inclusions
 
3. Transport of superheat to the solidifi cation front
 
4. Rate of solidifi cation
 
5. Microstructural phenomena
Indeed, caster performance is intricately related to the fl uid fl ow phenomena. 
Widespread interests therefore exist among steelmakers and researchers to gain use-
ful insight into fl ow within the solidifying strand. Rigorous modeling of fl ow and 
the associated transport process across the entire length of the strand nevertheless 
poses formidable diffi culties due to complex interlinkage between numerous physi-
cochemical and thermal phenomena. These are discussed below briefl y.
 
1. Flow in the port region and the mold is turbulent. In the submold region, 
fl ow is relatively sluggish. Further down-the-strand, fl ow is extremely weak, 
driven primarily by thermosolutal convection. Therefore, drastically differ-
ent fl uid fl ow conditions prevail within the solidifying casting.
 
2. There are three distinct regions, namely, liquid, mush (a mixture of solid and 
liquid), and the solid in the solidifying strand. The relative proportion of each 
region changes with distance below the meniscus. Flow within the mushy 
region is particularly complex and the physics is not yet completely understood. 
Considerable idealizations are needed to mathematically model fl ow and heat 
transfer simultaneously in all three regions of the solidifying casting.
  

Mathematical Modeling II: Liquid-State Processing Operations 
299
 
3. Flow fi eld generated in slab casting molds through bifurcated SEN is 
known to be asymmetrical and time-dependent. In a rigorous sense, such 
fl ow is not accurately resolved through a steady-state, turbulent fl ow model. 
Procedure beyond RANS is therefore needed.
 
4. Injection of gas bubbles, partial clogging of nozzles due to inclusion depo-
sition, entrainment of liquid and/or solid slag and mold powder via free-
surface fl ow, etc. induce uncertain, multiphase fl ow phenomena posing 
additional complexities.
Rigorous modeling of continuous casting as such entails multiphysics since free-
 surface fl ow, turbulence, heat transfer, and phase changes are involved. As the fron-
tier of solidifi cation modeling is beyond the current scope, a simplifi ed conjugate 
fl uid fl ow and heat transfer model is described in the following section.
6.9.2.1 Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions
A variety of approaches is adapted to formulate a coupled fl uid fl ow and heat transfer 
model for continuous casting of steel. A summary of these is presented in Table 6.6. 
The general features of numerical simulation have been
 
1. Flow phenomena is 3-D, homogeneous (i.e., single phase), and turbulent.
 
2. Flow and thermal energy transport phenomena are mutually coupled.
 
3. Flow is driven by the momentum of the incoming liquid steel as well as 
drag induced by the downwardly moving solidifi ed shell. Free convection

a In continuous casting process, it is diffi cult to implement the law of wall accurately since the solid–
liquid interface is not known a priori. Therefore, modeling of fl ow in the vicinity of solid walls via the 
high Reynolds number, k–ε turbulence model is uncertain. The low Reynolds number formulation on 
the other hand does not depend on such wall functions.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
effects due to temperature and concentration differentials have also been 
included in the mathematical formulation [34]. In situations where electro-
magnetic stirring and braking are important, electromagnetic force has also 
been considered [35].*
 
4. “Darcy fl ow condition” is typically assumed and “fl ow-through-a-porous-
media” approach has been adapted to model fl ow within the mushy region.
 
5. Damping of turbulence in mushy zone has been largely ignored. Throughout 
the strand, liquid and mushy zones are treated to be equally turbulent.
 
6. Secondary effects such as strand bending, mold oscillation, etc. have also 
been generally ignored.
A fl uid fl ow-based mathematical model of continuous casting is at least comprised 
of three distinct building blocks namely, the Navier–Stokes equations, Convection–
diffusion of thermal energy, and an appropriate turbulence model. If segregation is 
important, appropriate mass conservation equation is needed in addition to the above. 
In terms of an instantaneous, 3-D velocity fi eld, the equations of continuity and motion 
for incompressible, Newtonian fl ows are represented in vector notation as†

tion, electromagnetic force on the fl ow fi eld via Equation 6.95.
§ Flow transients and turbulence are not accurately captured by a RANS-based turbulent fl ow model. In 
this section therefore instantaneous equations are presented (35). Through time averaging or fi ltering 
of the instantaneous equations, one can readily derive the corresponding time-averaged forms or those 
applicable to the motion of the resolved scale.

The term associated with KP is the phase interaction force between solid and liquid 
in the mushy region that is taken to be proportional to the superfi cial liquid velocity 
relative to the velocity of the solid. This allows us to compute fl ow simultaneously 
within the liquid and the mushy region. The remaining two terms in Equation 6.95 
are, respectively, the buoyancy force per unit volume due to thermal and concen-
tration differentials in the system. The Darcy fl ow coeffi cient or the permeability

is suppressed and a constant downward velocity (= strand velocity, vC) is force-fi tted 
to simulate the descending motion of the solidifi ed strand and its resultant impact on 
molten steel fl ow. Such considerations allow us to carry out fl ow calculation over the 
entire domain encompassing all the three regions, namely, liquid, mush, and solid.

It is based on Equations 6.99 and 6.100, the extent of segregation during continuous 
casting is computed. Thermophysical properties relevant to the modeling of continu-
ous casting of plain carbon steel are summarized in Table 6.7.
Various types of fl ow boundaries in continuous casting are shown schematically in 
Figure 6.26 while a set of plausible boundary conditions on fl ow and scalar transport 
equations are detailed in Table 6.8. It is to be emphasized that governing equations 
are elliptic and hence appropriate downstream boundary conditions are needed on 
all variables. For example, the mold exit is not a true physical boundary. There, truly, 
no information on fl ow, temperature, etc. is available. Also prescription of a routine

“outfl ow” boundary condition at the mold exit is inappropriate, since fl ow there is far 
from fully developed.* Therefore outfl ow boundary as a fi rst approximation has to be 
placed in the completely solidifi ed region where liquid velocity is zero and thermal 
gradients are not appreciable. This necessitates fl uid dynamic calculation through the 
near stagnant zone of the strand, which itself is not free from uncertainties. A scheme 
of calculation based on a coupled fl uid fl ow and heat transfer approach is suggested 
in Figure 6.27.
6.9.2.2 Model Prediction and Validation
Numerous studies have been carried out to mathematically model solidifi cation 
and heat fl ow phenomena in continuous casting embodying the two previously 
mentioned modeling approaches. In recent years, however, the fl uid fl ow-based 
approach has been more frequent wherein segregation, inclusion population etc. 
have been predicted in addition to solidifi cation profi le, cast surface temperature,

and so on by coupling a scalar transport equation with an appropriate turbulent 
fl uid fl ow and heat transfer calculation procedure. Multiphase fl ow models have 
also been applied to study the evolution of slag–metal interface in actual casters 
and entrapment of mold powders. More recently, a large eddy simulation (LES) 
has been carried out to study solidifi cation behavior in a continuous slab caster in 
the presence of an applied electromagnetic fi eld [36]. In Figure 6.28, a compari-
son between experimentally measured solidifi ed shell thickness* at various axial 
stations and those predicted via an LES-based conjugate fl uid fl ow heat transfer 
model is shown. Despite many uncertainties, close agreement between prediction 
and measurement is evident.
6.10 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Mathematical modeling of a variety of rate processes such as melting, dissolution, 
 mixing, grade transition, inclusion transport and removal, postcombustion, solidifi -
cation and continuous casting, etc. are described in this chapter. In each description, 
conceptual modeling and formulation are given the maximum emphasis. Accordingly, 
assumptions, boundary conditions, and solution algorithms have been worked out in 
reasonable detail and presented for each individual problem. In addition, compari-
sons between prediction and measurements are also considered wherever possible 
to highlight the usefulness of the mathematical model study programs. The material 
presented in this chapter demonstrates that signifi cant advancements have been made 
during the past decades and we now have physically based models for a variety of 
steelmaking processes.
* In actual caster operation, it is diffi cult to measure solidifi ed shell thickness directly. Typically, esti-
mates of shell thickness are obtained from:

Modeling III: Solid-State 
Processing Operations
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Steelmaking encompasses refi ning in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF), secondary 
processing in ladles, continuous casting, and, fi nally, mechanical working, and sur-
face and heat treatment. The manufacturing of steel therefore includes processing in 
both the liquid as well as the solid states. Liquid-state processing operations mostly 
deal with temperature, composition, and cleanliness adjustments and involve chem-
ical reactions, fl uid fl ow, turbulence, heat and mass transfer, etc. On the other hand, 
solid-state processing operations are concerned with microstructure, texture, and 
surface characteristics of steel and include mechanical working (both hot and cold 
working) and fi nal fi nishing operations such as heat treatment, galvanizing, etc. 
Both liquid- and solid-state processing operations are technologically signifi cant 
as these dictate steel quality as well as the service performance of various steel 
components. This is also true of process route, which permits the direct production 
of fi nished hot strip coils through strip casting without having to do much process-
ing in the solid state. A broad classifi cation of steelmaking processing operations is 
illustrated in Figure 7.1.
Modelings of some key solid-state processing operations are described in this 
chapter, starting with simple diffusive heat and mass transfer processes* such as 
reheating and gas carburization. Microstructural evolution during deformation and 
solidifi cation processing are described next. The paradigms of microstructural evo-
lution, deformation including texture, etc., are substantially different from those 
discussed so far. Naturally, an exhaustive treatise of these and their modelings is 
beyond the current scope. Textbooks [1–3] and proceedings† devoted exclusively 
to the modeling of solidifi cation and microstructure, deformation phenomena, etc., 
are available, and these form excellent resource material for more comprehensive 
knowledge.
* Diffusive phenomena are characterized mathematically by a gradient type law. For example, heat con-
duction, molecular diffusion, eddy diffusion, etc., depend on temperature, concentration, and velocity 
gradients, respectively.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
7.2 MODELING OF DIFFUSIVE HEAT TRANSFER PHENOMENA
A vast majority of solid-state processing operations in steel melt shops are carried 
out at elevated temperatures causing redistribution of the temperature within the 
solid material. This induces thermal stresses and infl uences the kinetics of micro-
structural evolution, the effi ciency of mechanical working, etc. Adequate knowledge 
of temperature distribution in solid steel is therefore a prerequisite to the study of 
phase transformation and deformation processes. In the modeling of such processes, 
thermal calculations generally precede or are carried out simultaneously.
Heat fl ow and the redistribution of temperature within a solid are due to  conduction. 
The latter, for example, is important in reheating operations and determines complete 
homogenization periods for steel slabs and ingots. In the following, the modeling of 
transient heat conduction phenomena is discussed in detail to elucidate the genesis 
of thermal fi eld calculations.
7.2.1  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: HEATING OF A STEEL SLAB 
IN A REHEAT FURNACE
Flat products such as sheets and strips are produced from continuously cast steel 
slabs through hot rolling at temperatures above the recrystallization temperature* 
* Recrystallization temperature is the temperature at which strain-free crystals are spontaneously 
produced. Hot working operations, by defi nition, are those carried out above the recrystallization 
temperature (~1173 K, but depends on the composition and initial level of strain in the material).

of steel. Before hot rolling, steel slabs are routinely heated in gas or oil fi red 
furnaces, called reheat furnaces. Continuously cast slabs (hot or cold) in batches 
are periodically introduced in reheat furnaces through a side door. The slabs 
rest on a moving bottom and are made to gradually travel through several heat-
ing zones within the furnace to be ultimately discharged at a temperature close 
to their recrystallization temperatures. Thus, a given slab is made to spend a pre-
determined time within the furnace to attain a practically homogenous hot work-
ing temperature. Finally, the hot slab is transported to either a rolling mill or 
soaking pits.
A given slab, during its residence in a furnace, receives heat from the ambient as 
well as its surrounding neighbors. Accordingly, these infl uence the required dwell 
time and the attainable fi nal temperature. In industrial reheating operations, it is also 
important to avoid overheating as the latter adversely infl uences the microstructure, 
leading to poor effi ciency of the reheating operation as well as poor product per-
formance. Mathematical models are generally used to evolve operating guidelines 
on such issues as fuel burning rate, slab dwell time, etc. These, in conjunction with 
measured slab surface temperatures, are often applied to optimize reheat furnace 
operations and practices.
The time–temperature history in a slab within a reheat furnace can be mathemati-
cally modeled from two different standpoints considering either (1) the  simultaneous 
transfer of heat within the furnace and slab due to combustion, radiation, and con-
duction phenomena or (2) to heat conduction with the given furnace or ambient 
temperature.
The former is substantially more complex and involves the modeling of turbulent 
combustion and heat transfer phenomena, similar to those described in Section 6.8. 
The latter approach, on the other hand, is simplistic and involves solving a transient 
heat conduction equation. Both these approaches necessitate the simultaneous map-
ping of temperature in all the slabs present so as to accurately account for the net heat 
received and lost by a given slab (note that each slab receives heat not only from the 
furnace ambient but also from its surrounding neighbors). In the following, a single 
object formulation is described fi rst. This is subsequently generalized to multiple 
solids/slabs.
7.2.2  MODEL FORMULATION: ASSUMPTIONS, GOVERNING EQUATIONS, 
AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
Consider a steel slab receiving heat via convection and radiation in a reheat fur-
nace. Within the slab, heat fl ows purely by conduction and, as a result, temperature 
within the solid increases. As the solid’s temperature progressively advances, a 
transformation reaction (viz., pearlite → austenite) sets in within the solid, infl u-
encing the induced temperature fi eld further. The characteristics of the reheating 
operation are
 
1. Heat conduction phenomena in the slab are unsteady.
 
2. Heat fl ow is three dimensional (3-D).
  

316 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
 
3. A volumetric heat source operates within the slab due to a solid-state phase 
transformation reaction. The heat source is fi nite and nonzero only within 
the characteristic transformation temperature range.
 
4. Heat fl ows from the ambient to the surface of the solid via a combined 
mechanism of convection and radiation.
 
5. The solid, as it gradually moves in the furnace, is exposed to the changing 
thermal environment.
On the basis of the above, we can describe the time–temperature evolution within the 
slab via a transient, 3-D heat conduction equation expressed in terms of the Cartesian 
coordinate system as*

The following inputs are required to solve Equation 7.1:
 
1. Temperature distribution within the furnace, i.e., T∞, at all time.
 
2. Initial temperature fi eld within the solid, i.e., T(x, y, z, 0).† If the solid is 
initially at room temperature, the task is simple. Alternatively, a detailed 
distribution of initial temperature within the solid at the moment of its

Lightfoot).

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
heat transfer coeffi cients, etc., often pose diffi culties in rigorous modelings of  thermal 
fi elds. Similarly, reliable inputs on furnace temperature and initial slab temperature 
are needed. Modeling of the thermal fi eld is at the expense of some idealizations.
The volumetric heat source term, ST say, for plain carbon steel, is derived from 
the solid-state phase transformation reaction, pearlite (P) → austenite (A), between 
temperatures A1 and A3.* This is directly related to the rate of change of the austenite 
phase volume fraction and is represented as

 is the rate of change of the volume fraction of austenite. The 
manner in which γA (t), the volume fraction, changes with time is dictated by the asso-
ciated transformation kinetics, and ∂γA(t)/∂t is needed for a closure of Equation 7.1. 
Fortunately, the transformation kinetics for plain carbon steel has been relatively well 
investigated and an appropriate model for γA(t) is available. Since heat effects asso-
ciated with solid-state phase transformation are generally not appreciable, one can 
therefore, as a simplistic recourse, assume equilibrium and evaluate Equation 7.2 in a 
straightforward manner from the Fe–C phase diagram.
Alternatively, the effect of phase transformation on the temperature fi eld can also 
be accommodated by setting ST = 0 in Equation 7.1 and artifi cially enhancing the 
specifi c heat within the transformation temperature range according to

Heat effects associated with solid-state phase transformation reactions are typically 
small, about two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the latent heat of freezing 
or melting. Consequently, uncertainties associated with their precise modeling are 
generally not a matter of concern as far as the prediction of thermal fi elds in solids steel 
is concerned. Equation 7.1 together with the associated initial and boundary condi-
tions are not amenable to analytical solutions and hence are to be solved numerically. 
A scheme of the numerical solution is suggested in Figure 7.3.
7.2.3 MODEL PREDICTION AND VALIDATION
Equation 7.1 was solved [4] via Fluent® to simulate the heating of a small steel slab in 
a laboratory-scale electrical furnace. The following assumptions were invoked [4]:
 
1. Constant density and specifi c heat
 
2. Negligibly small heat source term
* A1 and A3 temperatures are two of the many characteristic transformation temperatures of an 
 iron– carbon system. A1 is typically about 1021 K while A3 is much higher and depends on the carbon 
content.
  

Mathematical Modeling III: Solid-State Processing Operations  
319
 
3. Negligible contact resistance between the slab and the fl oor of the furnace
 
4. Predominantly radiative transport of heat from the ambient to the slab 
surface
Characteristics of the Fluent-based calculation scheme are summarized in Table 7.2 
while a comparison between predicted and corresponding experimental tempera-
tures at the geometric center of the steel slab is illustrated in Figure 7.4. These, as 
expected, indicate a much pronounced initial rate of heating, which fades out gradu-
ally with time. Despite many idealizations,* the simplifi ed heat fl ow model captures 
the actual evolution of temperature within the slab reasonably accurately.
* Many of the idealizations invoked are for the sake of simplicity and can be easily done away with. Indeed, 
substantially more rigorous modeling of the phenomena is possible if, for example, the heat source, 
temperature-dependent emissivity, and thermophysical properties are incorporated in the model.

1. The same partial differential equation (p.d.e.) (viz., Equation 7.1) continues 
to dictate the temperature fi eld in all the slabs present.
 
2. A given slab exchanges heat not only with the furnace environment but also 
with its neighboring companions.
 
3. Radiation view factors for the slab assembly in the furnace are required 
to quantify the heat exchange between multiple objects. These necessitate 
a priori knowledge of the number of slabs and their geometrical arrange-
ments within the furnace.
 
4. The net thermal exchange between two neighboring slabs depends on their 
respective characteristic surface temperatures. Multiple object formulation 
accordingly entails simultaneous estimation of temperature in all the slabs 
present in the furnace.
Thus, given the geometrical arrangement of slabs* in the furnace, the relevant 
radiation view factors (e.g., F1−2, F1−3,…Fi−j, and so on) between various constituent 
members can be conveniently worked out from the principles of solid  geometry. 
Based on that, the net heat fl ux (comprising contributions from neighboring slabs 
as well as the furnace environment) working through the various surfaces of 
each individual slab is estimated in terms of the surface temperature of the slabs. 
Embodying appropriate boundary conditions, the temperature profi le within each 
slab can be predicted through the numerical solution of Equation 7.1, following 
a scheme that is essentially identical to the one shown in Figure 7.3. In essence, 
with n number of solids, the task is to precalculate the radiation view factors and 
solve a set of n transient heat conduction equations together with their associated 
boundary conditions.
7.3  MODELING OF SIMULTANEOUS DIFFUSIVE 
HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER PHENOMENA
Simultaneous heat and mass transfer processes are frequently encountered in 
 steelmaking. In the context of molten steel processing, these have already been 
 discussed in Chapter 6 (i.e., melting and dissolution, free convection, material mix-
ing, etc.). Parallel examples that include the simultaneous transport of heat and mass 
in the solid state are the formation of oxide scales during annealing, the galvaniza-
tion of steel strips and plates; and surface treatment operations such as carburizing, 
nitriding, etc. In all these, the distribution of the temperature and composition within 
the solid can be addressed from the same phenomenological standpoint. In this sec-
tion, as a typical example, gas carburization of plain carbon steel is discussed to 
illustrate the basic modeling principles associated with the simultaneous diffusive 
* Geometrical arrangements of slabs/ingots in some reheat furnaces change with time as slabs are 
periodically taken out and new ones inserted. As a result, slabs/ingots are exposed to time-varying, 
thermal environment. This complicates modeling further.

transport of heat and mass.* The thermal modeling considerations are similar to 
those described earlier and hence presented only briefl y.
7.3.1 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: GAS CARBURIZATION OF STEEL
Gas carburization involves the heating of solid steel in a furnace in an environment 
of premixed CO and CO2 gases. During the process, the following chemical reaction 
occurs at the surface of the solid† steel:
 
2
2CO(g)
C
CO (g)
→
+
 
(7.4)
As a result, the carbon is dissolved in the steel. The progressive dissolution of carbon 
sets up a differential concentration profi le within the solid causing the migration of 
carbon atoms from the surface to the interior. The diffusion of carbon continues, 
leading to a several hundred micron thick carbon rich layer (generally referred to 
as the case depth). Gas and plasma carburization are industrially applied to ferrous 
material to concentrate the carbon content in the case region. Within the carbon reach 
layer, harder constituents form, leading to a remarkable increase in local hardness in 
comparison with the bulk.
In a typical gas carburization operation, a solid steel object, initially at some tem-
perature, is placed in a furnace that is maintained at a predetermined temperature. 
As the temperature of the solid increases continuously, a mixture of CO and CO2 
gas is passed through the chamber. At some point of time, the chemical reaction, 
i.e., Equation 7.4, sets in at the surface, initiating the diffusion of the carbon into the 
steel. Thereafter, the temperature and composition of the solid change simultane-
ously. Thermal equilibrium with the ambient is attained fi rst and, thereafter, diffusion 
of carbon occurs essentially under the isothermal condition. Following a predefi ned 
dwell time, the solid object is removed and taken away for further processing.
For a given set of operating conditions (e.g., furnace temperature, CO–CO2 ratio, 
etc.) the case depth is solely determined by the dwell time. Prior estimates of case 
depth and required dwell time are possible through simultaneous modelings of 
temperature and compositional variation‡ within the solid.
7.3.2  MODEL FORMULATION: ASSUMPTIONS, GOVERNING EQUATIONS, 
AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
A mathematical model for gas carburization is formulated on the basis of the following 
considerations:
* Mass diffusion process in carburization and in many other similar processes involves multicomponent 
diffusion as well as solid-state chemical reactions, the formation of new phases, and so on. By coupling 
suitable kinetic models with generalized diffusion equations, such complexities can be accommodated 
in the calculation scheme.
† Correct temperature and gas composition (i.e., CO/CO2 ratio) are the keys to drive the chemical reac-
tion in the forward direction.
‡ The modeling of the carbon concentration profi le in isolation is approximate since the carbon concen-
tration and temperature both change simultaneously within the solid (at least for some initial period 
of time).
  

Mathematical Modeling III: Solid-State Processing Operations  
323
 
1. Heat conduction and the diffusion of carbon govern the temperature and 
composition in the solid.
 
2. Heat conduction and mass diffusion processes are unsteady as the tempera-
ture and carbon composition in the solid change with time.*
 
3. Heat and mass transfer phenomena are coupled one way. Accordingly, the 
concentration fi eld depends on temperature, but not vice versa.
 
4. The solid is cylindrical-shaped and heat and mass transfer phenomena are 
axisymmetrical.
The time evolution of temperature and carbon concentration within the solid is 
described via transient, two-dimensional (2-D), axisymmetrical heat conduction, 
and mass diffusion equations, respectively.† The appropriate forms of the conserva-
tion equations are expressed in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinate as

concentration are set to zero at r = 0. Since the diffusion coeffi cient, DC(T), and 
the surface concentration of carbon, 
*
C
C (T), are temperature-dependent parameters, 
Equation 7.6 is coupled with Equation 7.5. In a rigorous sense, thermal and mass 
diffusion phenomena are mutually coupled since thermal conductivity depends on 
material composition. Furthermore, the diffusion of carbon may initiate a solid-state 
chemical reaction associated with a fi nite heat effect. Looked at from such stand 
points, heat and mass transfer phenomena in gas carburization are truly mutually 
interdependent. The dependence of thermal conductivity on composition and heat 
effects associated with solid-state chemical reactions is typically less pronounced. 
As a result, the computation of heat fl ow can be decoupled from mass diffusion cal-
culations. Based on the above, an appropriate solution strategy can be worked out.
7.3.3 KINETIC CONSIDERATIONS
An inference of the surface concentration of carbon 
*
C( )
C
T  can be made from the 
kinetics of the mass transfer process and, thereby, the boundary conditions to the 
mass diffusion equation defi ned explicitly. Gas carburization of steel is the result of 
the following kinetic steps working in series:
 
1. Transport of CO gas to the solids surface
 
2. Chemical reaction, 2CO(g) → C + CO2(g), at the gas–solid interface
 
3. Removal of CO2 from the reaction site
 
4. Diffusion of carbon into solid steel
Of these, the diffusion of carbon into solid steel is the rate-limiting step* and deter-
mines the growth rate of the carbide layer or case depth. Therefore, the rates of the 
remaining three kinetic steps can be taken to be infi nitely fast relative to the rate of 
step 4. This implies that the carburization reaction (i.e., step 2) at the solid surface 
is at thermodynamic equilibrium.

* The rate of chemical reaction at elevated temperatures is generally fast owing to its exponential depen-
dence on temperature. Similarly, the convection process readily brings in reactants and removes prod-
uct gases from the reaction site. In contrast, diffusion is a slow process and therefore one can anticipate 
the diffusion of carbon to be the rate-limiting kinetic step. The growth rate of the carbide layer is 
experimentally found to be in proportion to the ½th power of treatment time [5]. This indeed confi rms 
that diffusion of carbon through the carbide layer is the rate-limiting step.

thus estimated is by no means unique and changes during the gas carburizing process 
as long as the solid’s surface temperature keeps changing. Equations 7.7 through 7.11 
provide a formalism for the estimation of the surface concentration of carbon.
7.3.4 AN ALGORITHM
The governing heat fl ow equation is a nonlinear p.d.e. and therefore, an iterative 
solution scheme is required. On the other hand, the mass diffusion equation‡ is a lin-
ear equation and therefore can be solved directly within a given time step. Since the 
diffusion of carbon depends on temperature, a sequential solution procedure (ther-
mal energy balance equation followed by the mass diffusion equation) is helpful to 
solve the governing equations. Based on that, an algorithm can be developed for the 
solution to Equations 7.5 and 7.6 together with their associated initial and boundary 
conditions. A scheme of the numerical solution is shown in Figure 7.6.
7.3.5 MODEL PREDICTION AND VALIDATION
The thermophysical properties of plain carbon steel at elevated temperatures are 
summarized in Table 7.4. These indicate that the thermal diffusivity of steel is sev-
eral orders of magnitude larger than the mass diffusivity. Therefore, the temperature 
within solid steel changes at a much faster rate and approaches the state of thermal

mass diffusion equation can be solved exclusively. Furthermore, if radial diffusion 
is assumed to be important (i.e., L/D ≥ 6.0 and hence the cylinder is mathematically 
infi nitely long), an analytical estimate of case depth is possible via an exact solution 
to Equation 7.6.
Carbon diffusion together with phase transformation* during gas carburization 
of high-alloyed stainless steel was studied at 1228 K both experimentally and com-
putationally [6]. Thermo-Calc® software combined with the CALPHAD approach 
were applied to solve a unidimensional mass diffusion equation. The calculations 
were performed in two stages: one for solving the diffusion equation and the other 
for calculating the equilibrium between the phases. In the fi rst step, grid point 
concentrations were calculated within a given time. Subsequently, equilibrium 
calculations were performed to obtain the compositions of the new phases. Based 
on that, the amount of different phases and the carbon profi le in the steel sample 
were deduced as a function of time. A comparison between such estimates and 
an experimentally measured carbon profi le is illustrated in Figure 7.7. Excellent 
agreement between the two is evident.
7.4 MODELING OF MECHANICAL WORKING
Mechanical properties are structure intensive and, therefore, the microstructures of the 
fi nal products following continuous casting or mechanical working tend to profoundly 
infl uence the performance and service life of steel components. The microstructure is 
governed by the complex interplay the among mechanical, thermal, and metallurgi-
cal changes that occur during a process. For example, in rolling operations, the fi nal 
microstructure forms due to both thermal and mechanical changes, but in reheating, it 
forms due to thermal changes alone. Naturally, a process path dictates the microstruc-
tural modeling strategy to a large extent and is illustrated in Table 7.5. This indicates 
that knowledge of deformation and thermal phenomena is a prerequisite to micro-
structural modeling. In the following, the modeling of thermally assisted deformation 
phenomena is fi rst described briefl y. This is followed by a discussion on the modeling 
of the microstructural evolution presented as the fi nal section of the chapter.
7.4.1 MODELING OF DEFORMATION PHENOMENA
Mechanical working is carried out at elevated temperatures, below and above the 
recrystallization temperature, to produce a wide range of products, i.e., fl at (e.g., 
steel strips), round (wires and rods), and long (beam blanks, rails, and so on). This 
infl uences the microstructure and texture of steel, exerting considerable infl uence 
on the latter’s physical and mechanical properties. By judicious control of the pro-
cess parameters during mechanical working, a wide range of physical and mechani-
cal properties of the fi nal product can be achieved. Traditionally, thermally assisted 
* In the discussion presented so far, the formation of new phases due to various solid-state chemical 
reactions (many dissolved elements typically exist in steel, and diffusing carbon often reacts with these) 
is ignored. One can address these on the basis of the relevant phase diagrams and some idealizations.

deformation and the associated microstructural phenomena were investigated 
 empirically. Currently, mechanistic models are being increasingly applied and these 
allow the prediction and control of the microstructure and mechanical properties of 
the fi nal products with a reasonable degree of certainty.
In thermomechanical processing, deformation, thermal, and microstructural phe-
nomena all operate simultaneously and are generally interdependent. During the 
process, the material interacts with the ambient and the equipments; the deforma-
tion process itself generates heat (through the conversion of mechanical to thermal 
energy) and these infl uence the solid’s temperature throughout the deformation pro-
cess. Phase transformations are also operative as dynamic recrystallization often 
occurs depending on the temperature and strain rate. The precipitation of new phases 
leads to volume changes and generates or dissipates heat, affecting the distribution 
of stress and temperature within the solid. Looked at from such standpoints, a com-
plete simulation of microstructural evolution embodies the simultaneous modeling 
of deformation, thermal, and microstructural phenomena. Owing to the interplay of 
many phenomena, the complexity of such a simulation is generally enormous, as one 
might anticipate from Figure 7.8.
Mechanical working such as rolling, forging, extrusion, etc., involves large-scale 
plastic deformation induced by the applied load. In addition, a differential temper-
ature may also induce thermal stresses, thereby affecting the overall stress fi eld.* 
The distribution of internal force or stress fi eld within the solid is required in order to 
predict microstructural phenomena, crack formation, residual stress fi eld, and so on. 
Suffi cient expertise in the deformation theory, fi nite element methods, and structural 
software packs are the prerequisites to the modeling of thermomechanical process-
ing of steel. Excellent resource material on these topics [2,7–9] exists.
* A time-dependent temperature gradient induces thermal stresses in a solid body. Typically, the magni-
tude of induced thermal stress is many orders of magnitude smaller than the mechanical stress.

The following are the two popular approaches of solving deformation problems 
relevant to the processing of steel:
 
1. Updated Lagrangian formulation
 
2. Eulerian or fl ow formulation
The updated Lagrangian formulation follows a marching solution technique and 
approximates the solution through many successive increments or intervals (of-time, 
displacement, force, and so on) assuming that the deformation and rotation of the 
body are small within such increments. In this, the initial state is taken as the refer-
ence state and the applied force is increased by a small amount to result in small 
increments of corresponding displacements and strain. In this way, the displacement 
vectors and the components of the stress tensor are calculated. The current confi gu-
ration of the body is obtained after a certain number of such increments. A number 
of p.d.e. together with a set of constitutive relationships defi ne a general deformation 
problem. In the updated Lagrangian formulation, these are

3. Constitutive equations (incremental stress–strain relationships), i.e., dσij = 
Cijkldεkl
The total number of equations and their exact form depend on the nature of the 
 deformation problem,* 2-D vs. 3-D (i.e., plain strain or generalized strain), isotropic 
vs. anisotropic, and so on. For example, in a 3-D problem, the unknowns are the 6 
independent stress components (3 normal and 3 shear stresses), 6 corresponding strain 
components, and the 3 displacement components. These involve 15 unknowns and, 
therefore, 15 corresponding equations and relationships. The following are the three 
different types of boundary conditions applied to the deformation model equations:
 
1. Assigned displacement at the boundary
 
2. Assigned traction force† at the boundary
 
3. Assigned derivative of displacement at the boundary
Often, particularly in high-temperature metal working operations, thermal and defor-
mation processes are coupled. Additional equations in the form of temperature–strain 
relationships are needed to model such situations. A mathematical  formulation of a 
simple deformation problem is outlined in Worked Example 7.1 to further explain the 
equilibrium equations, constitute relationships, etc.
* This determines the constitutive relationships involved.

Consider the uniaxial, 2-D compression problem illustrated in Figure 7.9. There, a 
planar solid under the application of a load is shown at two different instants of time, t and 
t + dt, respectively. For the given problem at hand, we have the following unknowns:
 
1. Two components of displacement, s1 and s2
 
2. Three components of strain, e11, e12, and e22
 
3. Three components of stress, σ11, σ12, and σ22
The objective is to compute the displacement of the body satisfying the equilibrium 
conditions. As there are eight unknowns, we can write eight equations and repre-
sent the compression problem mathematically in terms of the updated Lagrangian 
formulation as

Boundary conditions on displacement† and stress defi ne the problem completely. 
Thus, on the top and bottom surfaces as well as on the two vertical surfaces, infor-
mation on s1, s2, σ11, and σ22 is required. These are‡
 
1. At the top surface, dσ22 = dqo
 
2. At the two vertical surfaces, dσ11 = 0
 
3. At the bottom surface, ds2 = 0
In addition, to constrain the rigid body movement, displacement has to be restricted 
at any convenient location and, accordingly, another condition arises as ds1 = 0. 
Embodying strain–displacement and constitutive relationships, equivalent condi-
tions on the relevant stress components can be derived.
The Eulerian or fl ow formulation is relatively more frequently used to simulate 
metal working operations. In metal working, plastic strain generally outweighs its 
elastic counterpart and the problem is essentially considered as rigid plastic or rigid 
viscoplastic in nature. In some situations, where phenomena associated with elastic-
ity are important, this is known as solid formulation. In the case of solid formulation, 
the material is considered to behave as an elastic–plastic or elastic–viscoplastic solid. 
A 3-D, fl ow formulation based, deformation model embodies 16 equations, e.g., 10 
p.d.e.’s and 6 constitutive relationships.§ These include

These govern relationships between three velocity components, six components

cussed earlier.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
Finite element methods are customarily used to solve equilibrium equations 
together with the constitutive relationships. In this, the body is divided into a num-
ber of small elements (analogous to domain discretization in fi nite difference) and 
incremental forms of various equations are derived. These are subsequently solved 
over the entire domain by visiting the ensemble of such small elements.* In a typical 
calculation scheme involving negligible thermal stresses, incremental displacements 
are fi rst calculated. Based on the incremental displacements, current stresses and 
hence the current internal force are calculated. The difference between external and 
internal forces (i.e., the unbalanced force) is repeatedly calculated till the unbalanced 
force becomes negligibly small. As the unbalanced force tends to zero, the calcu-
lated displacement exactly satisfi es the equilibrium equations. Exact fi nite element 
calculations are complex and time intensive. Often, model equations are simplifi ed 
without having to compromise on accuracy. For real-time applications, neural net-
works are being applied to simulate and control industrial metal working operations. 
Commercial softwares are available to carry out the modeling of metal working oper-
ations. Several computer programs compiled in Ref. [9] can also be used to solve a 
variety of simple structural problems.

In Equation 7.13, κT is the heat generation effi ciency, representing the fraction of

between 0.9 and 0.95. The fraction of the remainder of the plastic deformation 
energy is expended to cause changes in dislocation density, grain boundaries and 
phases, etc. Equation 7.12 is therefore coupled to the deformation model equations 
and cannot be solved in isolation.
* In this way, a complicated global solution is approximated by a model that consists of piecewise con-
tinuous solutions at individual nodes.

7.5 MODELING OF MICROSTRUCTURAL PHENOMENA
Microstructural modeling is carried out in various scales. In this section, macroscale 
modeling and mesoscale modeling are briefl y described. In the former, modeling 
is carried out over a macroscopic length scale wherein some average attributes of 
the microstructure, i.e., volume fraction of phases, the grain size for an entire work 
piece or a macroscopic part thereof, are quantifi ed. With the advancement of com-
puting power, mesoscale (i.e., on the length scale of the microstructural features) 
modeling is also becoming increasingly popular to predict actual microstructures.
7.5.1 MACROSCALE MODELING
Grain growth, recrystallization, and phase transformation phenomena are frequently 
modeled in macroscale [10]. In addition, precipitation phenomena are also investi-
gated in macroscale to address the strength contribution of the precipitates to  different 
kinds of alloy steels. Such models have been largely empirical, specifi c to the compo-
sition of steel, and often require tuning to specifi c mill conditions to be suffi ciently 
predictive. The knowledge base in this area is due to a large number of investigations 
carried out during the past three decades or so. Suffi ciently reliable empirical models 
for the microstructural engineering of plain carbon steel now exist.

Recrystallization
Three distinctly different kinds of recrystallization processes occur during high tempera-
ture deformation processes. These are static recrystallization, dynamic  recrystallization,

Similar expressions exist for dynamic and metal dynamic recrystallizations. Through 
such expressions, thermal and deformation phenomena are directly related to trans-
formation kinetics and exert infl uence on the associated microstructure. In Equation 
7.17, Rg is the gas constant and A, a, b, c, and EA, rex are empirical parameters, deter-
mined generally from a laboratory-scale simulation.
Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) requires the application of a critical strain 
that is larger than that for static recrystallization (SRX). The critical strain εmc for 
dynamic recrystallization is frequently described by the following relationship:

* The mechanism of nucleation of strain-free (recrystalized) grains depends on the strain, strain rate,

time, dynamic recrystallization during roll bite, and metadynamic recrystallization in the interpass 
time following dynamic recrystallization.

namely,
 
1. Monte Carlo simulation

Although such methodologies are applied to plate rolling, dendritic solidifi cation, 
etc., a number of details are yet to be clarifi ed to evaluate the pros and cons of these 
formulations for modeling a particular microstructural phenomenon. With the rapid 
advancement of knowledge and computing power, it is anticipated that predicting 
actual microstructures will be frequent and will dominate microstructural engineer-
ing in the years to come. For the present purpose, it is suffi cient to review here briefl y 
one of these emerging modeling techniques. As an example, a brief description of the 
phase fi eld model and its application to the prediction of a solidifi cation microstruc-
ture is presented in the following paragraphs.
A variety of problems including free dendritic growth, directional solidifi cation, 
Ostwald ripening, interface-particle penetration, etc. have been successfully modeled 
via the phase fi eld approach [11]. Initially developed for pure metals, the approach 
has been systematically extended to binary alloys and later to more industrially

relevant multiphase, multicomponent systems. In the phase fi eld model, the state of 
the phase is represented continuously, by an order parameter, the phase fi eld, Φ. For 
example, Φ = 1.0, Φ = 0, and a fi nite region, in which 0 < Φ < 1.0, represent the solid, 
the liquid, and the interface, respectively. The rate of change of the phase fi eld Φ is 
assumed to be proportional to the variation of the free energy functional, i.e.,

related to the interfacial energy and has a positive value in the interface region. The 
second term is the free energy density and is the sum of the free energies of the solid, 
liquid, and a double well potential in the interface region. It is through this term that 
the thermal fi eld exerts direct infl uence on the phase fi eld, Φ. The free energy func-
tional f(Φ, T) is given by [11]

The equilibrium assumption necessitates a small interface width compared to the 
capillary length. The order of the interface width, for example, is 10−8 m for metals 
and 10−5 m for alloys (relative to capillary length). Alternative prescriptions exist.
While the interface is sharp in the case of pure metals, for binary alloys, the inter-
face is assumed to be a region where the phase fi eld changes gradually from one state 
to another. Expressions for the free energy of a solid, f S, and a liquid, f L, have the 
form of a composition weighted mixture of free energy of solute, A, and solvent, B.

The approach necessitates that in conjunction with the phase fi eld and the thermal

positional variation in binary alloy systems. The phase fi eld parameters W and εo 
are the same as those in the case of pure metals mentioned above, while a markedly

different expression for the phase fi eld mobility, ξ, is considered for binary alloys. 
Such prescriptions are being continuously improved as phase fi eld models are 
adapted to multicomponent, multiphase systems with convection. More elaborate 
descriptions of phase fi led models are available in Refs. [12,13].
The fi rst phase fi eld simulation has been due to Kobayashi [14], and one of his 
typical results is shown in Figure 7.12. There, the effect of anisotropy and noise on 
the dendritic structure during solidifi cation of a pure metal is illustrated. In many 
subsequent studies, secondary arm spacing, directional solidifi cation, peritectic 
transformation, etc., were modeled through the phase fi eld technique and a reason-
ably good agreement with measurements was demonstrated.
The next generation phase fi eld models (PFMs) for solidifi cation will involve 
quantitative predictions of microstructures for industrial materials such as steel, alu-
minum alloys, and so on. Since the basic principles are formulated, extension of 
currently available PFMs to industrial material is on the horizon. The most serious 
problem with PFM is the remarkably intensive computational time. Effi cient algo-
rithms and massively parallel processors are likely to play decisive roles in their 
future applications.
7.6 CONCLUDING REMARKS
A variety of solid-state processing operations are routinely carried out in steel 
mills beyond continuous casting to change shape and to improve surface fi n-
ish, microstructure, and the resultant mechanical properties. In this chapter, 
 mathematical modeling of heat and mass transfer, thermomechanical processes, 
and microstructural evolution is presented. The general methodology of modeling 
of thermal fi elds in solids is fi rst presented with reference to industrial slab reheat-
ing operations. Subsequently, the modeling of simultaneous, diffusive heat, and 
mass transfer phenomena is considered and, as a typical example, gas carburiza-
tion of plain carbon steel is discussed. Relevant computational and experimental 
results drawn from the literature are included to demonstrate the general adequacy 
of the model study program. In addition, basic premises of modeling thermome-
chanical processes and microstructural evolution are also presented in the chapter. 
As a fi nal topic, a next generation microstructure modeling technique, i.e., PFM, 
has also been.

Modeling of Ladle 
Metallurgy Steelmaking
8.1 INTRODUCTION
High temperature steelmaking processes are inherently complex and their model-
ing, as seen in earlier chapters entails major efforts. Currently available compu-
tational fl uid dynamics (CFD) platforms yet do not offer “reacting, multiphase 
turbulent fl ow, and heat transfer” capability, which is often a prerequisite to the 
modeling of many steelmaking processes. Developing such models in-house with 
advanced mesh generation and postprocessing capabilities is complex as well as 
time intensive and this impedes rigorous process modeling exercise. Therefore, 
for every conceivable problem, it may not be currently possible to develop mod-
els from fi rst principles. In addition, computational process models, such as those 
outlined in the preceding chapters, generally involve prolonged run time, which 
is a serious hindrance to their application particularly when output is desired in 
real time (i.e., as in industrial process control). Also in many instances, one is 
concerned with global rather than local behavior. For example, despite thermal 
inhomogeneties in steel processing vessels, an average rate of change of tempera-
ture is often needed to quantify the extent of melt temperature drop or pickup. 
Rigorous modeling is not important in such context and available simplifi ed mod-
els do suffi ce. In the absence of elaborate differential models, macroscopic as well 
as input–output models (i.e., Chapter 9) provide effective alternative platforms to 
investigate steelmaking process dynamics.
A variety of macroscopic models dealing with rate phenomena in steelmaking 
are available. In this chapter, macroscopic models pertaining specifi cally to ladle 
metallurgy steelmaking are described owing to their relative predominance in lit-
erature as well as their technological signifi cance. Models of ladle fl ows, mixing, 
plume (or slag) eye area, slag droplet entrainment, melting and dissolution, etc. are 
discussed fi rst. Following that, their adequacy and appropriateness to high temper-
ature melts is illustrated with the aid of a few case studies. Potential applications 
of many underlying concepts are also elucidated at appropriate places with the aid 
of several worked examples.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
8.2 MODELING APPROACH
A macroscopic process model provides a relationship between a dependent variable 
of interest and key operating parameters and is generally worked out via
 
1. Mechanistic approach wherein the principles of conservation of mass, 
momentum, and energy are applied
 
2. Dimensional analysis coupled with experimental observation
 
3. Experimental measurements and regression
Macroscopic models derived on the basis of the fundamental conservation laws are 
often not entirely rigorous since many idealizations and approximations are involved 
in their formulation. In general, such models, wherever available, are at best semiem-
pirical. Models in the latter categories are derived on the basis of experimental mea-
surements and are therefore empirical in nature. Looked at from such standpoints, the 
scope of macroscopic models appear to be limited. These are generally found to work 
satisfactorily as long as the physical basis of their formulation is not violated. For exam-
ple, macroscopic fl ow models developed specifi cally for ladle refi ning are likely to be 
ineffective in basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking, as the latter operates under a 
drastically different fl ow regime. On the other hand, the same turbulent convective heat 
transfer correlation could predict melting rates of solids in ladles and BOFs with equal 
effectiveness, because melting in either system is often governed by the transport of heat 
across the thermal boundary layer. Given that, generalization* of macroscopic process 
models may or may not be straightforward. Furthermore, macroscopic models often 
embody empirical data derived from physical models. Consequently, some apprehen-
sions concerning their adequacy to actual steelmaking always exist as physical models 
seldom replicate high-temperature phenomena accurately.
8.3 MACROSCOPIC MODELS
A brief discussion on ladle refi ning is already presented in Section 1.3.2. As an 
introduction, a physical picture of the inert gas injection operation is presented 
here so that one can understand and appreciate the way in which an injected sub-
merged stream of argon interacts with the surrounding liquid steel in a ladle to 
cause stirring. A priori knowledge of fl ow, as we have noted earlier, is a general 
prerequisite to rate calculation since steelmaking tends to be transport rather 
than chemically controlled.† The fl ow of molten steel in ladles thus exerts consid-
erable infl uence on the effi ciency of typical processing operations such as alloy-
ing, melting, dissolution, dispersion, inclusion fl oat out, thermal stratifi cations, 
and so on.
* Regression models tend to be system and plant specifi c and hence, there is no legitimacy of their 
blanket generalization.
† The rate of a chemical reaction, as we have seen in Chapter 2 is given by

Therefore rate of reaction in steelmaking environment is generally large and the likelihood of a 
process being transport controlled is relatively more.

Ladle metallurgy practice at two different steel plants is summarized in Table 8.1. 
This indicates that many operations such as composition adjustment, refi ning (i.e., 
desulfurization), homogenization, etc. are carried out in ladles embodying a wide 
range of argon fl ow rates. These, as one would note here, are substantially smaller 
than the fl ow rates of oxygen in BOFs and energy optimizing furnace (EOFs). 
Specifi c potential energy input rate associated with ladle refi ning as seen in Table 8.1 
lies in the range of ~ 0.01(min.) and 0.2 (max.) W/kg. Such small values correspond 
to the bubbling regime and are characterized by a relatively low Mach number* that 
is generally much smaller than unity. At such gas fl ow rates, large bubbles or gas 
envelope typically forms at orifi ces or porous plugs. These, being hydrodynamically 
unstable, shatter a short distance above the orifi ce into an array of smaller bubbles. 
With continuous disintegration and coalescence phenomena at work, a dynamic 
range of sizes within the spherical cap regime is established. Therefore, during ladle 
refi ning, large gas envelops forming at the nozzle or orifi ce rapidly devolves into a 
plume (i.e., an upwelling, two-phase mixture of argon and liquid steel) of spherical 
cap bubbles. The plume during its rise gets progressively wider through entrainment 
* Mach number (Table 3.2) in the present context is defi ned as the ratio of free space velocity of gas to 
the velocity of sound in air. At Mach number greater than unity, jetting phenomenon is assumed to 
ensue (Section 2.7.1).

of the surrounding liquid. Ultimately, the gas bubbles escape to the ambient through 
the free surface while the entrained liquid fl ows out radially to create a torroidal 
motion of molten steel within the ladle. The region where the bubbles break through 
into the ambient is known as the “plume (or slag) eye.”
The average gas voidage* within the rising plume is small and is typically about 
2%–10% of the total volume of the argon–liquid steel plume. The physical phe-
nomena associated with gas injection in a ladle can therefore be approximated as 
an equivalent of an unconfi ned liquid jet, i.e., 
p
/
1
R R >> , in which energy is trans-
ferred over its entire length through the action of large rising bubbles. The total 
energy supplied by the incoming gas† (= ρ1gQL; L is the depth of liquid over which 
bubbles rise) is primarily the potential or buoyancy energy since kinetic energy 
(
o
2
g
0
0.5m U
=
) is negligibly small, i.e., typically less than 1% of the potential energy 
supplied by the gas bubbles. Flows in gas-stirred ladles are therefore essentially 
buoyancy driven. The process description highlighted above is elucidated via a 
schematic in Figure 8.1, wherein large spherical cap bubbles are seen to be distrib-
uted sparsely within an up-welling mixture of argon gas and liquid steel. There, 
the upward fl ow in the central region leads to an outwardly directed surface fl ow 
of molten steel to the ladle walls and fi nally a reverse horizontal fl ow back toward 
a rising plume, which are well-established features of axisymmetrical‡ ladle fl ows. 
Macroscopic fl ow models of argon-stirred steel ladles are derived on the basis of 
such considerations.
Worked Example 8.1

i. Rate of potential (or buoyancy) energy input
 
ii. Specifi c potential energy input rate and the ratio of kinetic energy to poten-
tial energy input rate
 
iii. Estimate their corresponding values at the maximum argon fl ow rate shown 
in Table 8.1.
The plume, due to its gas content, is lighter than the surrounding liquid. By defi ni-
tion, the buoyancy force experienced by a plume is

M
g  
* Typically expressed as a percent value, this is synonymous to “gas-volume fraction” and is therefore 
equivalent to the ratio of volume of gas contained within the plume to the total volume of the plume.
† Ferro static head and melt temperature both infl uences the volume of argon bubbles during their rise. 
To avoid complications in this simplifi ed analytical treatment, one can, for the sake of convenience 
work out on the basis of an equivalent volume that is referenced to 1873 K and total pressure at the mid 
bath depth level.
‡ An axisymmetrical gas-stirred ladle embodies a centrally located (i.e., r = 0) gas injector. In practice, 
a porous plug is rarely placed at the centric position.

8.3.1 PLUME VELOCITY
The gross physical phenomena associated with injection of argon into molten steel 
contained in a cylindrical-shaped ladle are illustrated schematically in Figure 8.2. 
Once gas injection is initiated, the initially stagnant melt progressively accelerates 
attaining a steady-fl ow condition after some time. Such behavior is readily apparent 
in Figure 8.3, wherein the variation of average speed within a model ladle is shown 
as a function of time. This suggests that the corresponding time to attain a steady 
state or the fl ow establishment period is relatively small, of the order of tens of sec-
onds or so. Once a steady-fl ow condition is reached (i.e., the average speed† of the 
bath becomes constant or time invariant), a balance is established between energy 
supply and energy dissipation in the system [3]. Possible energy dissipation mecha-
nisms in gas-stirred ladle system include
 
1. Turbulence
 
2. Bubble slippage
 
3. Wall friction
 
4. Free surface phenomena (viz., waves, spout, and ejection of droplets)
 
5. Slag–metal interactions
* Analysis tends to become somewhat uncertain in the case of a porous plug where available area to fl ow 
is diffi cult to ascertain in actual practice.

Equation 8.10 suggests that the mean speed of liquid recirculation or the average

the gas fl ow rate. In addition, the amount of liquid contained in the ladle infl uences 
the liquid turnover rate. Thus, for a given fl ow rate, while a relatively greater bath 
depth promotes liquid recirculation, a wider vessel, on the other hand, has quite the 
opposite effect.
Plume rise velocity is an important and signifi cant velocity scale in gas-stirred 
ladle system and is determined on the basis of empirically established correlations.

Flow establishment period evidently is insignifi cant in comparison to the duration of 
industrial ladle-refi ning operations.

The creation of an “eye” and the exposure of the melt to the atmosphere in a slag-
covered ladle are shown schematically in Figure 8.4. This indicates that the plume 
eye remains subsurface and prevents contact between melt and the ambient provided 
the slag layer thickness is at least equal to the height of the spout, i.e., hspout.

8.3.2 BULK EFFECTIVE VISCOSITY
Various types of eddy viscosity models (i.e., zero order or algebraic, one equation and 
two equation models, etc.) and modeling of turbulent fl ows have been summarized 
briefl y in Chapters 2 and 5, respectively. In this section, bulk effective viscosity mod-
els for gas-stirred ladle systems are discussed. The objective is to demonstrate how 
a physically based simple turbulence viscosity model is formulated for a complex 
steelmaking reactor. Turbulence viscosity as has been pointed out earlier depends 
on the nature of the fl ow and therefore varies from one location to another within 
a fl ow. As such, the concept of a global average turbulence viscosity is simplistic. 
Nonetheless, in exploratory fl ow modeling and computation of inertial force domi-
nated fl ows, bulk effective viscosity models are a suitable fi rst-hand replacement for

This suggests that eddy or turbulence viscosity increases according to a third power 
of the kinetic energy of the incoming fl uid. Furthermore, for a given velocity and 
mass fl ow rate, a wider vessel intensifi es turbulence while a longer chamber retards 
the same. Such a formulation, however, is physically inconsistent with gas-stirred 
ladle systems since the latter is driven by potential rather than the kinetic energy of 
the injected gas. Further, the intensity of stirring and therefore turbulence in such 
systems at any given gas fl ow are known to increase with bath depth and decrease 
with vessel radius. These are in direct contrast to Equation 8.15. Based on dimen-
sional considerations and comparisons presented in Table 8.2, Equation 8.15 has 
been modifi ed [7] and adapted to gas-stirred ladle systems as

viscosity in a fl ow domain can also be obtained from a differential turbulent fl ow model. 
Comparing that with those deduced on the basis of Equation 8.17, an appropriate value 
of the constant, CV can be determined and is found to be equal to 5.5 × 10−3 [7].

the following data: ladle size = 185 ton, gas fl ow rate = 40 Nm3/ h, density of steel = 
7000 kg/m3, and viscosity of steel = 0.0077 kg/ms.
The given gas fl ow rate of 40 Nm3/h as shown in Worked Example 8.3 is equiv-
alent to 0.0367 m3/s. Furthermore, from Table 8.1, L = 2.625 m and R = 1.79 m.

are strongly infl uenced by operating fl ow rate and nozzle dimension. On the other 
hand, physical dimensions of the ladle hardly infl uence such details. Equations 
8.18 through 8.20 are originally developed for gas injection through a nozzle (typi-
cally a cylindrical tube) and are as such diffi cult to extrapolate to situations in 
which a porous plug is used as the gas injection device. This follows since orifi ce 
or nozzle dimension, dn, is somewhat ambiguous in the context of gas injection 
through the porous plug.
Imposing the conditions, z = zo, (i.e., the penetration depth) and αcl = 0.5, Equa-

Macroscopic models for plume parameters are primarily derived from room tem-
perature models. Experimental trials with liquid mercury, wood’s metal as well as 
limited actual high temperature experimental data confi rm that thermophysical 
properties of the system such as surface tension, viscosity, etc. are in general not 
critical. This is evident from Figure 8.6. We can therefore assume that quantitative 
descriptions of argon–liquid steel plumes under industrial ladle refi ning conditions 
conform reasonably to various models presented above.

Accordingly, the corresponding fractional penetration depths are, respectively,

injected gas is dissipated close to the nozzle implying that argon–liquid steel fl ow is 
 essentially buoyancy driven.
8.3.4 MIXING TIME
Macroscopic mixing models relate mixing times to operating variables and are pri-
marily formulated on the basis of experimental trials conducted in equivalent water 
model systems. Such models, being empirical, do not enjoy the same generality as 
the differential models of mixing outlined in Section 6.7.1. These, as a consequence, 
tend to be predictive under specifi c conditions only. For example, a mixing time cor-
relation presented in the following is valid provided

It is generally assumed that fl ow phenomena in ladles are dominated by inertial and 
gravitational forces and therefore, mixing is a function of the three-key ladle operat-
ing parameters namely, L, R, and Q. Accordingly, mixing time in ladles is described 
through a functional relationship of the following type [11]:

(local or bulk), the mixing criterion (95% or 99.9%), gas injection confi guration 
(central or asymmetrical), and so on. Experimental measurements show that mix-
ing times in axisymmetrical gas-stirred ladle systems decrease in proportion to a 
third power of gas fl ow rate. Similarly, mixing time is found to vary inversely with 
the bath depth, i.e., τmix ∝ L−1.0. These are shown in Figure 8.7a and b, respectively.

criterion,* Kmix ≅ 25.4 (m s−2)−0.33. Consequently, 95% bulk mixing time in an axisym-

exist and the popular ones are shown Table 8.3. These have many commonalities and 
therefore lead to similar estimates of mixing times under ladle-refi ning conditions.
Macroscopic models of mixing presented in this section are essentially valid for 
 axisymmetrical gas injection operation with no upper phase, slags, rather than no 
slag, being more typical of actual industrial practice. Mixing time correlation accom-
modating the effect of a slag layer has not been possible till date.* Nonetheless, it is 
known with certainty that the presence of slag retards mixing considerably. Given 
that, equations like Equation 8.26, etc. are seriously constrained as far as prediction 
of mixing time in industrial ladles is concerned.
Worked Example 8.6
To prove that τmix, 95% bulk = 25.4Q−0.33 L−1.0 R2.33 leads to a correct kinematic rela-
tionship between geometrically and dynamically similar gas-stirred ladles.

8.3.5 PLUME (OR SLAG) EYE AREA
As the injected gas escapes to the ambient through the overlying slag, it leads to the 
formation of a “plume or slag eye.” The “eye” is a potential site for steel reoxidation 
affecting phenomena such as Al/Ca fading, steel cleanliness, and so on. A relatively 
bigger eye also exacerbates heat loss to the ambient leading to noticeable drop in 
melt temperature during argon stirring. It is therefore desirable to know and control 
the extent of slag eye opening during industrial ladle-refi ning operations. The forma-
tion of a plume eye and the associated exposed area in refi ning ladles has been pre-
dicted via a transient, multiphase turbulent fl ow model. In the absence of a rigorous 
solution, one can deduce reasonable estimates of plume eye area from appropriate 
macroscopic models.
Bubble plumes expand in a near conical fashion in gas-stirred ladles (Figure 8.2). 
The upwelling plume, in the vicinity of melt free surface, starts to fl ow radially 
pushing the upper phase liquid (i.e., the slag) away from the axis of the plume toward 
the vessel’s side walls. The net result, as depicted schematically in Figure 8.4, is the 
creation of the “slag eye.”
On the basis of an idealized representation shown in Figure 8.9, a linear momen-
tum balance can be carried out along the vertical (z) direction over the volume 
element ABCD to establish the following relationship [16]:

2. The fl ow entering the volume element ABCD at section BC is essentially 
horizontal.
 
3. The pressure across section AB is uniform.
 
4. The upper phase liquid is practically stagnant.
 
5. The system is at a steady state.

Equation 8.35, a higher level of stirring creates a bigger eye area and a thicker slag 
layer, a smaller one. The fi tted constants Ao and Bo in Equation 8.35 are determined 
through regression embodying the measured eye area as a function of operating vari-
ables. For a 300 ton industrial-scale ladle, this is shown in Figure 8.10. On the basis

8.3.6 SLAG ENTRAINMENT
Physical phenomena at the slag–metal interface in a gas-stirred ladle system, e.g., 
deformation of the interface, entrainment of slag droplets,* etc. are shown sche-
matically in Figure 8.11. High-plume velocities associated with gas bubbling gener-
ally lead to the generation of droplets torn from around the rim of the plume’s eye. 
Entrainment of slag droplet and their entrapment in the melt are important processes 
known to infl uence the effi ciency of refi ning as well as melt cleanliness. Correlations 
have been developed [18] on the basis of water model trials to investigate the possi-
bility of slag droplet entrainment in argon-stirred ladles. In these, dimensional argu-
ments and regression were employed to correlate critical gas fl ow rate as a function 
* The phenomenon as illustrated is often referred to as “reverse emulsifi cation” and is dominant in 
systems with small density difference (e.g., water–oil). Signifi cant reverse emulsifi cation, however, is 
unlikely particularly at low to moderate argon fl ow rates since slag metal density differential in steel-
making is appreciable.

The critical velocity correlation presented above works satisfactorily for numerous 
combinations of upper phase and bulk liquid, having properties far beyond those for 
which the correlation has originally been developed. Applicability of Equation 8.37 
to gas-stirred systems for various combinations of upper and lower phase liquids is 
illustrated in Figure 8.12a and b, respectively. It is evident that although Equations 
8.37 and 8.38, etc. are primarily derived through water model trials, these are reason-
ably predictive for metallic systems as well. Thermophysical properties of steel–slag 
and water model analogue systems are summarized in Table 8.4. The differences 
between the model and the actual system in terms of thermophysical properties of 
liquids are truly remarkable!
Beyond the critical gas fl ow rate, intense mixing between slag and metal occurs 
spontaneously, leading to noticeable dispersion of the lighter phase into the bulk 
liquid. This enhances the effi ciency of various slag–metal reactions such as De-S, 
De-P, etc. To estimate their associated rate of transfer, a simple material balance on 
the transferring species is employed and the following relationship derived:‡

Estimation of the rate constant, km, is diffi cult since interfacial area, A, in a dispersed 
system is not readily determined. Despite attempts to quantify a volumetric mass 
transfer coeffi cient (= kmA) in terms of operating fl ow rates, etc., reliable explicit 
correlation for kmA currently does not exist. This makes prediction of the slag–metal 
mass transfer rate diffi cult.
8.3.7 HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN SOLID AND LIQUID
Melting and dissolution play important roles during deoxidizer addition, alloying, 
powder injection, etc. and exert considerable infl uence on the effi ciency of steel-
making processes. Many existing correlations have therefore been adapted and new 
correlations developed to predict melting and dissolution rates of solids in steel melt. 
A summary of these is presented in Table 8.5.
Convective heat and mass transfer correlations have generally been derived from 
water model trials. Typically, melting and dissolution rates have been measured 
experimentally as a function of operating variables and thermophysical properties, 
from which corresponding heat and mass transfer coeffi cients are estimated. These 
are subsequently fi tted to a regression model to arrive at the desired correlation. A 
few correlations have also been derived directly from molten metal systems.

8.4  APPLICATION OF MACROSCOPIC MODELS 
TO HIGH TEMPERATURE MELTS
The relatively large size of industrial steel processing ladles coupled with visual 
opacity of molten steel and high operating temperature generally preclude direct 
experimental observations on such units. It is diffi cult not only to develop process 
models based on industrial-scale observation but also to assess their adequacy and 
appropriateness through industrial-scale trials. Since macroscopic models are gener-
ally developed on the basis of measurements derived from aqueous systems, concerns

Thus, given L, R, and Q, the penetration depth, zo, (the axial distance at which gas 
fraction is equal to 0.5) is readily estimated from Equation 8.43. Two sets of esti-
mates of zo were accordingly derived [27] for a high-temperature laboratory scale 
(L = 0.18 mm and R = 0.18 mm), the gas-stirred molten iron bath corresponding to 
two different gas fl ow rates of 5 × 10−5 and 10 × 10−5 m3/s, respectively. In Figure 8.13, 
estimates of zo together with the measured gas fraction at various axial stations for 
the two gas fl ow rates are shown. There, predicted bath depths at which gas volume 
fraction corresponds to 0.5 are evidently consistent with the experimental fi ndings.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
8.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
Several macroscopic models of interest to ladle metallurgy steelmaking are discussed 
in this chapter. These were developed on the basis of experimental data derived from 
aqueous models incorporating relevant theory. Despite large differences in thermo-
physical properties between full scale and model systems and many idealizations, 
it is demonstrated that macroscopic models are reasonably predictive and form a 
reasonable basis for the fi rsthand calculation of rate phenomena in ladle metallurgy 
steelmaking. Given their adequacy, it is legitimate to consider macroscopic models 
as a fi tting companion to differential process models in steelmaking process analysis 
and design. The discussion has once again demonstrated the usefulness of physical 
modeling in steelmaking.

9 Intelligent Modeling: 
Neural Network and 
Genetic Algorithm 
in Steelmaking
9.1 INTRODUCTION
Process models discussed in Chapters 6 and 7 are of considerable scientifi c importance 
as these provide useful insight into high-temperature steelmaking processes which are 
otherwise diffi cult. Despite their potential and power as an effective modeling tool, 
they are not extensively used, particularly in the industry, as these tend to be complex, 
require specialized skills to develop and test, and require large computer run time. 
This latter issue makes mechanistic process models largely unsuitable where rapid 
calculations are desired, e.g., in actual process control. In addition, many steelmaking 
processes involve signifi cant complexity and rigorous modeling is often diffi cult. For 
example, it is practically impossible to model melting and refi ning in an electric arc 
furnace (EAF) from the fi rst principles with the current state of understanding.
Macroscopic process models such as those presented in Chapter 8 are likely to 
provide some respite in a limited sense. Such models however do not exist for all 
relevant phenomena. Moreover, these are at best semiempirical in nature and gener-
ally based on the data derived from water model studies or laboratory-scale, high-
 temperature investigations. Consequently, their direct application to process analysis, 
design, and optimization of steelmaking is not free from uncertainties. Alternative, 
powerful modeling techniques such as neural network, genetic algorithm (GA), etc. 
(collectively referred to as AI or artifi cial intelligence methods) are therefore getting 
popular and are being increasingly applied in recent years to model a variety of chal-
lenging problems in iron and steelmaking which, hitherto, have not been possible 
from mechanistic standpoints. Their acceptance and popularity as an effective mod-
eling approach is evident as special journal issues, dedicated exclusively to “intelli-
gent modeling of iron and steelmaking” are being published periodically [1,2]. A text 
book on the subject of modeling of steelmaking shall certainly remain incomplete 
without some discussions on the emerging modeling techniques.
AI is a large and growing fi eld. While scientists and engineers at academia and other 
research institutions contribute to AI’s body of concepts and techniques, manufactur-
ing industries have been applying AI predominantly for the design of new and effi -
cient products. AI techniques and methods today are practically applied in all fi elds of 

388 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
knowledge including philosophy, business, medicine, engineering, fi ction, and so on. 
In this chapter, AI and its relevance to steelmaking process modeling are discussed, 
albeit, briefl y. A couple of solved modeling examples, taken from the literature, are also 
presented to substantiate the potential and usefulness of AI methods to steelmaking.
9.2 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AI is defi ned as intelligence exhibited by a nonnatural, manufactured (and hence, 
artifi cial) entity. AI, as mentioned already, is studied in numerous fi elds deal-
ing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines, generally 
 considered to be computers. AI is primarily concerned with machines (i.e., essen-
tially  computer-controlled) to automate tasks in such areas as control, planning, 
and scheduling and with the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, 
handwriting, speech, facial recognition, etc. which normally require intelligence or 
intelligent behavior. In recent years, knowledge-based AI has also emerged as an 
engineering discipline concerned with the solution of numerous real-life problems, 
software applications, strategy games such as computer chess and the like.
Loosely, AI is classifi ed into two broad categories, namely, conventional AI and 
computational intelligence. Machine learning is central to conventional AI which is 
also known as symbolic or logical AI. This includes, among the various methods, the 
rule-based expert systems that apply reasoning capabilities to reach a conclusion. 
It is essentially used to mimic a human expert’s ability to reason according to the 
laws of logic about a particular class of problem. An expert system can sift through 
multitudes of alternatives which is generally not possible by human beings in a rea-
sonable amount of time. Many human experts contribute to the rule (or knowledge) 
base of any effective expert system making the latter extremely versatile. Expert 
systems are often used in diagnostic applications in basic oxygen furnace (BOF) 
steelmaking, continuous casting, etc.
Computational intelligence, on the other hand, involves iterative development or 
learning that is based on “empirical data” and involves many methods such as
 
1. Neural network: it is computational networks which attempt to mimic, in 
a gross manner, the networks of nerve cell (i.e., neuron) of the biological 
central nervous systems. Neural networks are acknowledged to have very 
strong pattern recognition capabilities.
 
2. Fuzzy system: these system include techniques for reasoning under uncer-
tainty. Such systems have been widely used in modern industrial and 
 consumer product control systems.
 
3. Evolutionary computation: it applies biologically inspired concepts such as 
population, mutation, survival of the fi ttest, etc. to generate increasingly 
superior solutions to a problem and includes methods such as, GA, tabu 
search, simulated annealing, etc.
The line of demarcation between the two categories of AI methods mentioned earlier 
is gradually fading as hybrid intelligent systems, combining the two aforementioned 
streams, conventional AI and computational intelligence, are coming up. While expert

systems are being applied to continuous casting, etc. for diagnostic applications, 
neural networks, and GAs are being increasingly applied to model and optimize a 
variety of steelmaking processes. In the following sections, the genesis of the  artifi cial 
neural network (ANN) and the GA are briefl y reviewed. Subsequently a few solved 
examples taken from the literature are discussed to illustrate the general adequacy of 
AI techniques to steelmaking.
9.3 ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
Neural network models are powerful nonlinear regression analysis methods that can 
relate a set of input variables to an output variable. For example, in ladle metallurgy 
steelmaking operations, one can visualize many input variables such as argon fl ow 
rate, vessel dimensions, and plug confi gurations, etc. vis-a-vis an output variable, 
the mixing time. Looked at from such a stand point, neural network models would 
grossly fall in the category of “input–output” models.
Neural network modeling (also termed as neural computing) represents a compu-
tational paradigm, in which the solution of a problem (i.e., the input–output correla-
tion) is learned from a set of examples. Consequently, some prior knowledge of the 
system (i.e., output of a given set of input parameters) is essential to neural comput-
ing. The learning of neural network can be on the basis of experimentally observed 
facts or, if possible, from an appropriate fi rst principle model. There are many excel-
lent texts [3,4], written on the subject and therefore, an exhaustive discussion on the 
principles of the ANN is deliberately avoided here. In the following section, some 
basic concepts are discussed to help readers familiarize with the subject.
9.3.1 BIOLOGICAL AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK [3]
Neural networks simulate, in a gross manner, the networks of neurons or nerve cells 
of the biological (human or animal) central nervous systems. Consequently, it is 
appropriate to fi rst discuss the gross structure and functioning of the interconnected 
neurons (or the neural networks) in a biological system. Such an interconnected net-
work of neurons is shown schematically in Figure 9.1. There, a single biological neu-
ral cell is comprised of the cell body, the axon (i.e., a type of connecting wire), and 
the presynaptic region. The cell body of the neuron, which includes the nucleus of 
the neuron, is where most of the neural “computation” happens and a decision or an 
output is produced. Neural activity passes from one neuron to another moving along 
the neuron’s cell, down the axon, and then through synaptic junctions at the end of 
the axon via a very narrow synaptic space to the dendrites of the next neuron.
A given neuron may have several synapses and can connect (i.e., pass a message 
or signal) to many other neurons. Similarly, as there are many dendrites in any given 
neuron, a single neuron can receive messages (i.e., neural signals) from many fel-
low neurons. Note that not all connections are equally weighted (i.e., some have a 
higher priority or weightage than the others in transmitting or receiving). Also some 
neurons are excitory while others are inhibitory (i.e., these block transmission of a 
message). The nature of such interconnections between neurons and weighting of 
messages is fundamentally very similar to ANNs.

A simple analogue of a neural element or neuron is shown in Figure 9.2 which is 
a common building block of every ANN. Analogs of cell body, dendrite, axon, and 
synaptic junction shown in Figure 9.1 are indicated in terms of appropriate parts in 
Figure 9.3.

9.3.2 ESSENTIALS OF NEURAL MODELING
A neural network consists of a number of simple processing elements (viz., Figure 9.3) 
also called nodes, units, or neurons. A simple and general representation of a “pro-
cessing element” or neuron is presented in Figure 9.4. As shown, the processing 
element has one output and several inputs. The inputs could be (1) output of other 
processing elements, (2) input signals from external devices, or (3) a part of neuron’s 
own output (e.g., as in recurrent neurons; see later). Processing elements “i” (i = 1, 
2, 3, … , n) are connected to one another via links with weights “wi” which represent 
the strengths of the connections.
After inputs are received by a neuron, a preprocessing operation is fi rst applied. 
Some common preprocessing functions, including summation, cumulative summa-
tion, maximum, or product of the weighted inputs, are summarized in Table 9.1. The 
output of the preprocessing operation is passed through a function called the activa-
tion function to produce the fi nal output from the processing element. Depending on 
the problem at hand, various types of activation functions such as linear function,

step function, sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent function, etc. are applied. Various 
possibilities are listed in Table 9.2. A set of relevant “input–output” variables in the 
context of a previously mentioned ladle mixing problem is summarized in Table 9.3. 
In its simplest form, the various inputs (viz., gas fl ow rate, vessel dimensions, etc.) 
together with their associated weights are transmitted through a neuron to produce 
an output (in this case the mixing time). Accurate determination of various weights

Notes:  The nonlinear activation functions shown in this table keep the cell’s output

three nonlinear activation functions in this table would produce output always 
in the range of 0 and 1. In many applications, however, the activation function 
is modifi ed in such a manner that its output ranges from −1 to +1 rather than 
from 0 to 1. This is accomplished by multiplying the previously mentioned

in which, b is the bias term (= w0B; B is a constant, constrained within ±1, and w0 is

sigmoid function (Equation 9.2) as the perceptron does. The procedure for setting 
the weights (of both connections and bias) is through what is commonly termed as

concerned.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
“training.”* The training is employed through a set of available outputs  corresponding 
to a set of inputs. As pointed out earlier, the set of outputs may be purely empirical or 
derived from a mathematical model. Without going through an elaborate mathemati-
cal derivation available elsewhere [3,4], the principle of training an artifi cial neuron, 
such as the one in Figure 9.4, and hence the determination of various weights can be 
summarized briefl y as follows.
Given “n” number of training dataset [x1, x2, …, xL]† and the desired output 
d1, d2, …, dn, the neuron, for any arbitrarily prescribed weights, will produce an 
output that is different from the desired output d1, d2, …, dn. If the neuron’s output 
is denoted by z1, z2, …, zn then n set of training errors defi ned as d1 − z1, d2 − z2, …, 
dn − zn can be estimated. It is through minimization of such errors, the values of 
various weights are determined and weight setting accomplished. To this end, least 
mean square (LMS), gradient least square procedures, etc. are commonly applied 
[3,4]. Once the weights of various connections and bias are determined, the required 
output corresponding to a new set of input variables can be easily determined via the 
trained neuron.
Perceptron and adaline are essentially a single-layer neuron. Many adaline or 
madaline on the other hand is a multilayer extension of the single neuron to a net-
work. Its basic structure is shown in Figure 9.5 in terms of two layers of adaline, 
plus an input layer which merely serves as a network’s input distributor. It is to be 
noted that no knowledge of the “desired” output of the inside layer is available at any 
* The training of a neural network essentially implies fi nding a set of optimal weights that tend to mini-

stage of computation. It is because of that, the inside layers, in a multilayer neural 
network, are referred to as the “hidden layers.” Evidently, an output from a hidden 
layer neuron cannot be evaluated against any desired output (of which no knowledge 
exists) and therefore, there exists no logical basis on which information fl owing out 
of an inside neuron is manipulated. Accordingly, the previously mentioned training 
methodologies for perceptron and adaline cannot be extended to madaline (or a net-
work) in a straightforward manner. Training methodology for madaline is therefore 
much different from those used for perceptron or adaline training. Madaline train-
ing is based on a technique popularly known as “minimum disturbance principle” 
[3]. Based on this, various weights in the network can be set.
There is a large class of problems that single-layer neural network (viz., Figure 9.4) 
is unable to address. Extension to three or more layers extends the range of problems 
that can be represented and hence solved by an ANN. The “minimum disturbance 
principle” is as such slow and not rigorous enough for solving general multilayer 
problems. An effi cient method of setting the intermediate weights and hence impart-
ing training to the hidden layers is via the “backpropagation algorithm” which is the 
basis of solution of a general multilayer problem. It is presented here very briefl y. For 
elaborate discussion, the interested reader is referred to Ref. [3].
A backpropagation algorithm* tries to minimize the objective function (Equation 
9.4) which is the “mean square error” (MSE) between the desired output and the 
neural network output. MSE which is calculated at the output layer is defi ned as

k represents the number of output nodes
Furthermore, dpk and zpk are respectively, the desired and network outputs. For exam-
ple, as illustrated in Table 9.3, the network output, e.g., mixing time is dependent 
on the input conditions (viz., vessel dimensions, gas fl ow rates, etc.) as well as the 
network parameters such as the weights. Evidently therefore, (dpk − zpk) is fi nite and 
nonzero. The backpropagation algorithm adjusts the weights in the steepest descent 
direction (i.e., negative of the gradient). This is the direction in which the error, ER, 
in the output variable decreases most rapidly. For a given set of input–output train-
ing data, the partial derivatives of the error with respect to each weight, ∂

are calculated in two passes. The forward pass calculates the output of each node of

in which εL is called the learning rate and is a model parameter (i.e., prescribed by 
the modeler). It is important to note that convergence* (to the fi nal set of weights) 
depends on the learning rate. A large learning rate enables quick convergence but 
can also lead to overstepping of the solution and oscillation of the error. On the other 
hand, a small learning rate, though may prevent oscillation, can take considerable 
time to reach a solution. A simple method for increasing the rate of learning without 
increasing the rate of oscillation is through the inclusion of a momentum term in the

scribed on the basis of personal experience or from the literature.
The training of a neural network is started by prescribing random small initial 
weights. A validation dataset is generally applied to determine when to stop training 
(i.e., when to declare convergence). It is well-known that a network which is  overtrained 
learns the details of the training data rather than the underlying input–output mapping 
and is therefore likely to perform poorly when given new data which it has not previ-
ously seen. The training process is monitored by keeping a close watch on the error. 
When the error stops decreasing, or even starts to rise, training is stopped.
9.3.4 CLASSIFICATION OF NEURAL NETWORK
ANNs are classifi ed according to their network structure and learning algorithms. In 
terms of their structures, neural networks are divided into
 
1. Feed forward network
 
2. Recurrent network
In feed forward network, neurons are generally grouped in layers. Signal or informa-
tion fl ows from the input layer to the output layer via unidirectional (i.e., forward) 
* Many passes or iterations are normally required to arrive at the optimum weights required to train a 
multilayer network. Iteration here is defi ned as a single sweep through all the input–output pairs in the 
training dataset.
  

Intelligent Modeling

connections. Therefore, the neurons are connected from one layer to the next, but not 
within the same layer. Feed forward network normally employ simple static neurons. 
The networks so far referred to in this chapter are essentially of feed forward type. In 
a recurrent network, on the other hand, the outputs from some neurons are fed back 
to the same neuron or to neurons in the preceding layers. Thus signals or information 
can fl ow in both forward and backward directions. Recurrent networks unlike feed 
forward network have a dynamic memory: their outputs at a given instant refl ect the 
current input as well as previous inputs and outputs. Functional structure of a recur-
rent neuron (also known as Hopfi eld neuron) is shown in Figure 9.6.
Neural networks are trained by the following two main types of learning 
algorithms:
 
1. Supervised learning algorithm
 
2. Unsupervised learning algorithm
In addition, there exists a third type, i.e., reinforced learning algorithm which in prin-
ciple is a special form of supervised learning. A supervised learning algorithm adjusts 
the strengths of weights of the interneuron connections according to the difference 
between desired and actual network outputs corresponding to a given set of input. 
Thus supervised learning requires a “teacher” or “supervisor” to provide the desired 
outputs. The backpropagation algorithm mentioned earlier falls in the category of 
“supervised learning algorithm.” In reinforced supervised learning, however, instead 
of using a teacher to provide desired outputs, a critic or criterion is employed to evalu-
ate the goodness of the neural network outputs corresponding to a given set of inputs. 
An example of a reinforced learning algorithm is the GA. This evaluates the good-
ness of the solution (or, output) through a random search method via a biologically 
inspired computational method. Unsupervised learning algorithm on the other hand 
does not require the desired outputs to be known. During training, only input patterns 
are presented to the neural network which automatically adapts the weights of its con-
nections to cluster the input patterns into groups with identical features. Till date, in 
a vast majority of neural network modeling studies of iron and steelmaking, the feed 
forward network together with supervised learning has been primarily employed.

9.3.5.1 Identifi cation of Input Variables
What constitutes the most plausible set of input variables for a given problem? An 
answer to this can only come from an in-depth knowledge of the problem at hand. 
Of course, as a starting point, one may consider a suffi ciently large number of input 
variables and later reduce the same, through trial and error, as long as the accuracy 
of prediction is not sacrifi ced. Needless to mention, a large number of input variables 
necessitate a large set of training data, which is often a serious bottleneck, since 
high-temperature shop fl oor data are relatively scarce.
9.3.5.2 Normalization of Inputs Variables
There generally exists a signifi cant difference between the scales of values of the 
input and output variables. For example, mixing time and gas fl ow rates expressed in 
SI unit differ by two to three orders of magnitude. Thus while the output is typically 
constrained between −1 and +1 or 0 and +1 through selection of an appropriate acti-
vation function, the same is not true of the various input variables which are avail-
able in a wide ranges and magnitude. The vastly different scales of inputs and bias 
values lead to ill conditioning of the problem. To avoid that, the input variable data 
are also routinely scaled. Two different but commonly used prescriptions include

In the former, x' lies between the limit −1 and +1 while in the latter, x' is constrained 
to vary between 0 and 1. In Equations 9.7 and 9.8, x is the original value of the vari-
able, x' is the normalized value while xmin and xmax, respectively represent the mini-
mum and maximum values of the variable in all the datasets.
9.3.5.3 Selection of Network Topology and Structures
In neural modeling, the choice of network architecture and connectivity is an issue 
of paramount importance. Although multilayer neural networks would be needed in 
general to handle nonlinear problems, too large and complex network is often not 
helpful since over parameterization usually results in poor performance due to over 
fi tting of the training data. Similarly, “too small a network” in turn lacks suffi cient 
representational capacity to capture the relationships between inputs and outputs. 
Methods of automatic selection of network complexity are available. In these, while 
constructive algorithms starting from a small network confi gure an optimal net-
work for a given problem, the destructive algorithms, on the other hand, start from 
a suffi ciently large network and through pruning of nodes or connections, confi gure 
the optimal network. Alternatively, an optimum network structure having suffi cient 
accuracy is confi gured through trial and error.
  

Intelligent Modeling

9.3.5.4 Selection of Initial Weights
In the backpropagation algorithm, the magnitude of the error propagated backward 
through the network is proportional to the value of the weights. If all the weights are 
initially set to be same, the backpropagated errors will also be the same and conse-
quently, all of the weights will be updated by the same amount. To avoid these, the 
initial weights of the network are to be prescribed randomly. Furthermore, to avoid 
premature saturation of the network, the initial values of the weights are normally 
distributed within a range. When the weights themselves are small (and hence the 
range, for example, −0.5 ≤ w ≤ 0.5), the neurons operate in the liner region (e.g., see 
Problem 9.5) of the activation functions preventing early saturation of the network.
9.3.5.5 Selection of Learning Algorithms
Reinforced supervised learning is perhaps most suited for neural network model-
ing of complex steelmaking processes. This is so as the gradient descent algorithms 
embodied in backpropagation method converge relatively sluggishly and have the 
potential to get trapped in local minima, particularly for those problems which have 
complex error surface and therefore, many minima. In contrast, a gradient descent 
method assisted by an intelligent optimization technique [5] or GA has the potential 
to reach global minima and hence fi nd a true set of optimum weights.
9.3.5.6 Computer Coding
A computational procedure is required such that neural networks can be designed, 
trained, and used effectively to estimate output parameters corresponding to a set of 
input conditions. The task is lengthy and tedious particularly if the network topol-
ogy and structure are complex. Alternatively, available software with ANN capabili-
ties can be adapted and used. These, like commercial computational fl uid dynamics 
(CFD) packages, help speed up modeling signifi cantly. A list of commercially avail-
able software with ANN capability is provided in Table 9.4.

9.3.5.7 Training and Validation Datasets
A large number of training datasets are required to determine the weights of various 
connections and bias in a neural network. In general, the number of training datasets 
should be more than the number of weights connecting different nodes. The training 
and validation datasets are obtained either from experimental measurements or from 
mathematical models such as those outlined in the preceding Chapters 6 through 8. 
Reliable industrial data are scarce, since measurements in steelmaking environ-
ment are diffi cult and cumbersome. Mathematical modeling on the other hand, due 
to numerous idealizations, often offers only approximate solutions. Toward this, a 
mathematical model tuned with actual plant-scale data that can generate an adequate 
number of reliable training and/or validation datasets is needed.
9.4 OPTIMIZATION AND GENETIC ALGORITHM
Process optimization studies in iron and steelmaking have been relatively less 
frequent. In recent years, optimization of iron and steelmaking processes such as, 
iron ore sintering, gas-stirred ladles, continuous casting, etc. were carried via intelli-
gent optimization techniques such as generic algorithm [1,2]. Apart from these, GAs 
are also applied to “neural modeling” of iron and steelmaking processes particularly 
to determine the optimum set of weights during network training. In the following 
section, a brief overview of optimization and GA is presented.
9.4.1 OPTIMIZATION
In mathematics, the term optimization refers to the study of problems in which one 
seeks to minimize or maximize a real function “f ,” termed as the objective or cost 
function by systematically choosing the values of real or integer variables from within 
an allowed set “A.” The domain A of “f ” is called the search space, often specifi ed 
by a set of constraints. The elements of “A” on the other hand are called candidates 
or feasible solutions. A feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes, if that is 
the goal) the objective function is called an optimum solution. Generally, when the 
feasible region or the objective function of the problem does not present convexity, 
there may be several local minima and maxima. The branch of applied mathematics 
and numerical analysis that is concerned with the development of deterministic algo-
rithms that are capable of ensuring convergence in a fi nite time to the actual optimal 
solution of a nonconvex problem is referred to as the global optimization. Many 
design problems can also be expressed as an optimization program. Such application 
is called design optimization and is particularly relevant to engineering practice. In 
the following section, a worked example is included to elucidate the above better.
Worked Example 9.1
Optimization of mixing time in gas-stirred ladles: the objective function and the 
associated constraints.
  

Intelligent Modeling

Mixing time in a gas-stirred ladle depends on gas fl ow rate, liquid depth, vessel 
radius, and so on (Section 8.3.4). As a typical example, the following relationship 
between operating variables and mixing time can be taken to represent an “objective 
function,” i.e.,

in which, the gas fl ow rate Q, the liquid depth L, and the vessel radius R are the 
three key decision parameters. The essential goal is to determine the possible values 
of gas fl ow rate Q, liquid depth L, and vessel radius R in the search space and to 
optimize these such that a minimum mixing time results. The constraints that defi ne 
the search space are known from operating practices and expressed in terms of the 
various decision parameters via the following:
 
1. Ladle metallurgy operations typically embody a limited range of gas fl ow 
rates or a specifi c potential energy input rate. For example, during argon-
 rinsing operation, the specifi c potential energy input rate is of the order of 
0.01 W/kg. Therefore, (in SI unit),

(=L/2R) typically varies between 0.7 and 1.3. Consequently, we have

3. Industrial ladles vary widely in size and capacity. Depending on BOF/EAF 
capacity, holding ladle size in a present day steel mill generally varies 
between 50 and 500 ton. Accordingly, setting Msteel = ρsteelπR2L, the fi nal 
constraint is formulated and expressed as

It is noted that each candidate or feasible solution must uniquely satisfy the above 
three constraints. Accordingly individual bounds on L, R, and Q are readily derived 
from the above. It is by minimizing the objective function with respect to the above 
mentioned set of constraints, operating conditions leading to minimum mixing time 
are worked out. Evidently, the very nature of the objective function suggests that a 
shortest mixing time is ensured at the maximum fl ow rate, minimal vessel diameter, 
and maximum bath depth.
The example cited above, involving a single objective or cost function, is called 
a “single objective optimization problem” which as described above, is treated as a 
  

402 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
“constrained optimization problem.”* Multiobjective (or multivariable) optimization 
on the other hand involves simultaneous optimization of two or more objective func-
tions. Most of the design optimization problems tend to fall in this latter category. 
For example, the objective function presented above indicates that a small vessel 
radius coupled with relatively large liquid depth and gas fl ow rate ensures shorter 
mixing times. Unfortunately such conditions in actual practice also create a rela-
tively large exposed slag eye (Section 8.3.5) area and make liquid steel susceptible to 
reoxidation. This is schematically illustrated in Figure 9.7 and indicates that higher 
operating fl ow rate, although is benefi cial to mixing, is counterproductive as far as 
the exposed slag eye area is concerned. Reoxidation seriously impairs the quality of 
steel and therefore, must be minimized as far as possible. From the operator’s point 
of view, desirable operating conditions are those ensuring shorter mixing times as 
well as smaller slag eye area.† In such context, we are concerned with a multivariable 
optimization problem.
A single-objective optimization problem usually has a single-valued, unique solu-
tion. The solution to a multiobjective problem is, on the other hand, not a particular 
* In contrast, minimization or maximization of an objective function in the absence of any constraints 
on decision variables is called an unconstrained optimization problem. A simple example to this is 
represented via the following objective function: y = x2 + 1.
† A relationship between slag eye area and various operating parameters presented in Chapter 8 can be 
applied here as the second objective function. The nondimensional slag eye area (Equation 8.36) is 
given as

value, but a set of values of decision variables such that, for each element in this set, 
none of the objective functions can be further enhanced without a decrease of some 
of the remaining objective functions. The solution constitutes a Pareto front and 
every value of a decision variable embodied in such a solution is referred to as Pareto 
optimal. The concept is illustrated through a schematic in Figure 9.8.
The area of optimization is loosely categorized into
 
1. Classical optimization
 
2. Intelligent optimization
Depending on whether or not derivative information is used during search (i.e., in 
seeking the optimum solution), all optimization techniques are generally catego-
rized into either direct or gradient-based methods. Methods that do not use derivative 
information are called direct search methods whereas gradient-based methods do 
employ such information. An intelligent optimization technique normally employs a 
guided, rather than a random, search method. Numerous text books are available on 
the subject of classical and intelligent optimization [5,6]. In the following section, a 
brief introduction to GA and its application to optimization is presented.
9.4.2 GENETIC ALGORITHM
GA falls in a class of optimization method based essentially on the search technique. 
In classical optimization, various search techniques commonly employed are often 
not capable of optimizing nonlinear, multimodal (i.e., an objective function having

many local minima and maxima) functions. In such cases, a random search method 
might prove useful. However, undirected search techniques do not always perform 
properly in fi nding the optimal solution particularly in a relatively large domain. A 
GA is a directed random search technique that can fi nd the global optimal solution in 
a complex search space. GA is modeled on natural evolution as it employs operators 
that mimic the natural evolution process. These operators, termed as genetic operators, 
manipulate individuals in a population over several generations to improve their fi tness 
gradually. The fi tness is evaluated, if available, on the basis of some references.
GAs do not use much knowledge about the problem to be optimized and do not 
deal directly with the parameters of the problem. For example, an answer to the mix-
ing problem discussed earlier can be conveniently derived through GAs, and thereby 
the best operating conditions (ensuring shortest mixing time) identifi ed, without GAs 
having to know anything about mixing at all! These work with codes that represent 
the parameters. Therefore, in seeking an answer, GAs would simply manipulate vari-
ous randomly generated numbers/values of L, R, Q, etc. in the search space, till the 
best solution is obtained. In seeking a solution through GAs, one is concerned with 
the following four major issues.
9.4.2.1  Coding of the Problem: Representation of the 
Problem Parameters
The parameters to be optimized are usually represented in a string form since genetic 
operators are suitable for this kind of representation. There are two possibilities and 
include (1) binary string representation, e.g., [100011010011] and (2) vector of inte-
gers or real numbers representation, e.g., [

w ] (w’s, say, are the various 
weights of a neural network) methods.
9.4.2.2 Creation of an Initial Population of Possible Solution
At the start of optimization, a GA requires a group of initial or candidate solutions. 
These are possible but not the fi nal solution. For example, any given set of values 
of L, R, and Q that satisfi es the three constraints makes a candidate solution. The 
procedure for formation of an initial population of candidate solution depends on the 
nature of the problem. For example, in problems where no prior knowledge exists, 
randomly generated solutions created by a random number generator can be applied. 
Determining the various weights of a neural network falls in this category. In con-
trast, when prior knowledge exists, a set of solutions satisfying a given number of 
constraints is applied as an initial population of solution. Clearly, optimization of 
“mixing time” discussed earlier falls in this latter category. There, numerous sets 
of values of L, R, and Q satisfying the given constraints can be applied as candidate 
solutions. In the latter case, GA initiates search with a set of approximately known 
solution and is therefore expected to converge to an optimal solution in less time than 
its predecessor.
9.4.2.3 Selection of Suitable Set of Genetic Operators
There are three commonly used genetic operators and these include selection, crossover, 
and mutation. Finer variations exist and are described in Ref. [7]. It is however not nec-
essary for a GA to deploy all such operators as it seeks to optimize a given problem.
  

Intelligent Modeling 
405
Through selection, more copies of individuals (or, candidate solutions) having 
relatively higher fi tness values (evaluated commonly on the basis of a quantitative 
frame work such as, Equation 9.4) are produced. The selection procedure is critical 
as it has profound infl uence in steering the search toward a promising area and there-
fore fi nding a good solution in a reasonable time period. Commonly used selection 
procedures include (1) the proportional selection and (2) the ranking-based selection. 
A desirable selection scheme does not allow any individual to generate too many 
offspring.
Crossover is used to create two new individuals (offspring) from two existing 
individuals (parents) picked from the current population through selection. There 
are several ways in which this can be accomplished. Common examples include 
one-point crossover, two-point crossover, cyclic crossover, and uniform crossover. 
Two different crossover techniques are illustrated in Figure 9.9 to explain the prin-
ciples involved. The crossover techniques are such that these ensure good diversity 
of population. This is required to avoid premature convergence and a poor solution.
In mutation, all individuals in the population are checked bit by bit and the bit val-
ues are randomly reversed according to a specifi c rate. Unlike crossover, mutation pro-
duces an offspring from a single parent string. It is to be mentioned here that all genetic 
operators are not compatible with the two types of representations mentioned earlier. 
The primary goal of using a mutation operator is to force the GA to search new areas.
9.4.2.4 Fitness Evaluation
This concerns an assessment of the quality of proposed solution and is accom-
plished by calculating how well the solution meets the desired objective and  satisfi es 
the given constraints. This is central to GA modeling and therefore, formalizing a 
procedure to compute the quality of solution is always an important issue in GA 
application. For example, the mean square error, i.e.,

can be taken as an index of fi tness of the proposed set of weights while training a 
neural network. In such a case, it is evident that of all the candidate solutions the 
one that provides the least MSE survives, being the fi ttest candidate solution. The 
optimal solution is the fi ttest individual of the fi nal generation, being the product 
of many cycles of selection, reproduction, and even mutation. Situations in which

a procedure cannot be formulated to quantify fi tness, a rule or knowledge-based 
procedure is adopted. The general methodology of a simple GA is illustrated in 
Figure 9.10a while a specifi c version, in the context of calculating various weights 
in a neural network, is shown in Figure 9.10b. Important control parameters of a 
simple GA include the population volume (the number of individuals or candidate 
solution in the population), crossover rate, and mutation rate. Their merits and 
demerits are summarized in Table 9.5. As mentioned already in Table 9.4, many 
optimization softwares are available and these can be effectively used in steel 
making applications.
9.5 APPLICATION OF ANN AND GA IN STEELMAKING
ANNs are being increasingly applied to monitor and control iron and steelmaking 
processes. Application area includes blast furnace burden distribution, BOF opera-
tion, ladle desulfurization, continuous casting, and so on. Similarly, GAs have been 
applied to optimize iron and steelmaking including burden material distribution in 
blast furnace, mold operation in continuous casting, sinter strand operation, etc. In 
addition to these, GA is embedded in many neural models as the requisite “network

training” platform. Applications of ANN and GA to a variety of problems in iron 
and steel making are documented well in the literature and confi rm their increasing 
popularity. A large number of such studies are presented collectively in Ref. [1]. 
In the following sections, two different practical problems are briefl y discussed to 
 demonstrate their usefulness to steelmaking.
9.5.1 BOF PROCESS CONTROL
The remarkable rate of conversion of liquid steel into a solidifi ed product through 
continuous casting necessitates BOF operators to deliver molten steel to the cast-
ers at an extremely high pace. Thus, BOF operators must ensure that target melt 
composition and temperature are consistently produced during oxygen steelmaking 
in a time bound manner. This is achieved by maneuvering correctly the end-blow 
period,* known to hold the key to a successful BOF operation. Typically, oxygen 
fl ow and coolant feed rates into the BOF are regulated properly during the end-blow 
period and these help attain the correct bath chemistry (i.e., carbon composition) 
and temperature at turn down. The BOF operators must therefore know a priori how 
much oxygen to blow or how much coolant (scrap, etc.) to add, during the end-blow 
period. Rigorous modeling of BOF operations is uncertain since high-temperature 
kinetic data are rarely available. Available mechanistic models are simplistic and 
approximate and therefore are not much help to the operators. A properly trained 
* The end blow period commences typically after about 85%–90% of way through oxygen blowing. This 
is the fi nal and the last stage of the blow and therefore required to be controlled effectively, so as to 
arrive at the correct bath temperature and chemistry.
  

408 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
neural network model, on the other hand, helps evolve the required guidelines on 
a plant-to-plant basis and assists the operator to control the oxygen steelmaking 
process effectively. This latter approach has been adapted to successfully control 
BOF steelmaking and has been reported in the literature [8]. Thus given the state of 
the melt (composition and temperature) at the end of the principal blow period,* and 
the desired, fi nal bath chemistry and temperature, a neural network-based model has 
been applied to evolve the end-blowing strategy. This is summarized below briefl y.
A feed forward network, involving a 4–4–2 topology (i.e., 4 input, 4 hidden, and 
2 output nodes) was applied to evolve the end-blowing strategy in which the back-
propagation method was used as the supervised learning algorithm. Computations 
were carried out via the software, the “Clementine data mining tool kit,” which 
had built-in ANN capabilities. The four input parameters were selected, as being 
the most signifi cant, based on an initial sensitivity analysis. These included, desired 
carbon composition, desired temperature, carbon composition at the end of main 
blow, and temperature at the end of main blow. These are summarized in Table 
9.6. Approximately 1600 actual BOF operating data were applied initially to train 
the neural network. On that basis, those ensuring absolute errors in end point 
temperature and end-point carbon smaller than 15 K and 0.04 wt % C, respec-
tively were retained to impart fi nal training to the neural network. A schematic of 
the neural model employed together with its predictive capabilities is shown in 
Figure 9.11a and b, respectively. In the latter fi gure, an ANN output on the amount 
on  coolant is seen to be practically equivalent to the practice.
BOF steelmaking is known to be a highly complex process. Chemically reacting 
multiphase turbulent fl ow coupled with heat and mass transfer poses considerable 
diffi culties in modeling of such systems from fundamental standpoints. The preced-
ing example demonstrates the potential of ANN to the modeling and control of com-
plex BOF steelmaking.
* A sublance is commonly used in steel melting shops to collect samples from the BOF for the determi-
nation of instantaneous melt composition and temperature. Such information (heat wise chemistry and 
temperature) are routinely collected and are available in abundance in melt shop log books.

9.5.2 DESULFURIZATION OF HOT METAL AND STEEL
Sulfur is the source of unwanted sulfi de inclusions known to seriously impair 
mechanical properties of steel. Consequently, residual sulfur level in steel is often 
not permitted beyond 50 ppm or so. Removal of sulfur (i.e., desulfurization) from hot 
metal (blast furnace iron) and steel is therefore important to steelmakers. Although 
there is a good deal of knowledge and understanding of the underlying thermody-
namics and kinetics, rigorous modeling of desulfurization poses considerable dif-
fi culties since kinetic data such as rate constant, slag–metal interfacial area, etc. are 
often not known with certainty. Neural network models, on the other hand, have

the potential to predict desulfurization, provided these could be adequately trained 
with reliable plant data. Thus, based on industrial-scale measurements of end sul-
fur content in hot metal and steel, neural network models were developed to evolve 
operating guidelines essential to contain sulfur within the permissible limit. This is 
outlined in Ref. [9], and is reproduced below in brief.
Two different networks were developed to predict fi nal sulfur level in hot metal 
and steel. For example, to predict end sulfur level in hot metal following calcium 
carbide injection in a 400 ton torpedo, an optimized network embodying a 5–8–1 
topology was applied. The backpropagation algorithm was used to train both the 
networks. Input and output parameters in the two neural models are summarized 
in Table 9.7. To confi gure optimum, well-trained networks, a large number of sen-
sitivity studies were carried out in which different network topologies, number of 
hidden nodes, number of training datasets, etc. were applied. The neural models for 
hot metal and steel desulfurization were respectively trained with 40 and 50 sets 
of plant-scale data. Predictions from the neural models are compared directly with 
plant-scale measurements in Figure 9.12a and b. Considering the complexity of the 
problems, it is evident that the trained networks are able to describe desulfurization 
process quantitatively reasonably well.
9.6  INTEGRATION OF ANN, GA, AND CFD: APPLICATION 
IN MODELING OF STEELMAKING PROCESSES
Theory of heat, mass, fl uid fl ow, and CFD have all been applied extensively to model 
steelmaking processes. The potential of complex transport models, despite their 
rigor, has not been fully exploited since meaningful solutions often do not follow

in a reasonable time frame. Consequently, in the context of real-time modeling, a 
key to industrial process control, fundamentally based elaborate models have seldom 
found widespread application. ANN models, in contrast, meet such requirements as 
these perform in real time and therefore are ideally suited. Looked at from such stand 
points, ANN based models have an edge over CFD as far as dynamic process control 
in steelmaking is concerned.
Neural network models with demonstrated capabilities are however not easy 
to build particularly in the absence of a large data base. As experimental measure-
ments in high temperature steelmaking reactors are diffi cult and cumbersome, pau-
city of industrial data is likely to be a serious hindrance to any involved neural 
modeling of steelmaking. Experimental measurements derived from water models

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
and laboratory-scale high-temperature systems are no substitute since these in many 
cases are not entirely representative of the steelmaking processes.
As industrial trials are generally diffi cult, hazardous, and at times prohibitively 
expensive, appropriately validated “heat, mass, and fl uid fl ow models” can supple-
ment and thus help generate the necessary database required to impart training to 
a neural network. This is important particularly when the experimental database 
is not  exhaustive. Two distinct advantages seem to follow from such an approach. 
These are
 
1. Trained networks conform implicitly to the basic laws of conservation of 
mass momentum and energy and are therefore likely to produce physically 
realistic solutions.
 
2. In contrast to equivalent CFD-based procedures, trained networks are 
likely to produce results relatively quickly and therefore have the potential 
for application in real time. This is particularly true of model-based train-
ing of neural networks by powerful optimization tool such as GA.
Looked at from such standpoints, a neural network, assisted by GA and CFD, having 
the fl avor of a fundamentally based model, is ideally suited for steelmaking process 
control. This is at least true for those situations for which reliable “heat, mass, and fl uid 
fl ow models” have been developed and their implications worked out. Such an inte-
grated approach has been very recently advocated for a real-time simulation of the gas 
tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process [10]. The underlying philosophy of such a pow-
erful calculation scheme is illustrated schematically in Figure 9.13. This indicates the 
way information obtained from a “heat, mass, and fl uid fl ow model” is integrated with 
a GA-based neural network, providing a predictive frame work that is signifi cantly 
simple, easy to maneuver and yet has the power of a rigorous, mechanistic model.

Basic principles of ANN and GA are introduced in this chapter and discussed from 
the viewpoint of modeling and optimization of steelmaking processes. Neural mod-
eling of two different industrial problems is described and through which potential 
of neural computations to modeling and control of steelmaking highlighted. It is 
pointed out that neural network models, assisted by GA and CFD, having the fl avor 
of a mechanistic model, are ideally suited for a real-time simulation of steelmaking 
processes and are already on the horizon.

10 Practice Sessions 
on Physical and 
Mathematical Modeling
10.1 INTRODUCTION
A textbook that is primarily intended to impart some basic training to modeling of 
steelmaking shall largely fall short without a well-thought-out practice session. We 
feel that theoretical training imparted through earlier chapters shall remain incom-
plete unless the readers get an opportunity to lay hands on a few simple physical 
and mathematical modeling exercises. It is with this objective we have designed and 
developed the material presented here. With earlier chapters providing requisite back-
ground, the reader should now be formally ready to execute the modeling exercises 
presented later in the chapter.
Over the years, numerous shop fl oor and design problems in steelmaking have been 
addressed through physical and mathematical modeling. From among these, a set 
of 10 relatively well understood, simple problems have been identifi ed, formulated, 
and posed to the readers. In Section 10.2, experiments have been designed such that 
one can execute these at a minimal cost as well as with least fabrication and opera-
tional diffi culties. Necessary background information precedes each exercise such 
that readers can appreciate the relevance of the problems posed. Similarly, math-
ematical modeling exercises are designed such that these can be readily confi gured 
and solved within a reasonable time frame through one of the many available com-
mercial computational fl uid dynamics (CFD) packages. In such context, implemen-
tation in Fluent® [1] has been described in this chapter. This is primarily due to our 
familiarity with the software. One can certainly employ other available softwares 
such as, COMSOL® [2], Flow-3D® [3], etc. to solve the proposed set of problems. 
Reasonable familiarity with commercial software is a necessary prerequisite of a 
present-day modeler. Section 10.3 on mathematical modeling thus provide an oppor-
tunity to explore commercial software and gain some expertise beyond what is pos-
sible through the embedded set of tutorial problems in such software. Moreover, 
against each problem, published solutions are provided for the sake of ready refer-
ence as well as cross-checking.
10.2 PRACTICE SESSION ON PHYSICAL MODELING
In this section, a set of fi ve different problems on physical modeling is described. 
These are deliberately kept simple such that with minor efforts and resources, 

418 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
physical models could be fabricated, experiments conducted, and some meaningful 
results obtained in a reasonable time frame.
10.2.1  PHYSICAL MODELING OF ARGON INJECTION 
IN A LADLE AND FLOW VISUALIZATION
Chemical effi ciency of many typical processing operations carried out in the 
present day steelmaking ladles are intricately related to fl uid fl ow phenomena.* As 
discussed in Chapter 8, practically all ladle techniques have one thing in common: 
these use gas (argon or nitrogen) injected through a submerged lance or plug to stir 
the contents (i.e., molten steel) of the ladle. The gas rising as a plume to the free 
surface induces a turbulent recirculatory motion of the liquid that helps control the 
rate of, melting, dissolution, mixing, slag–metal reactions, inclusion fl oat out, and so 
on. Consequently, detailed knowledge of fl ow in such systems is a prerequisite to rate 
calculation. Aqueous models of gas-stirred ladle systems are widely applied to study 
the characteristics (fl ow pattern and velocity magnitude) of the gas  injection-induced 
motion and to assess its possible impact on the effi ciency of refi ning, refractory 
wear, exposed plume eye area, etc. Visual observations, photographic techniques, 
and sophisticated fl ow measuring devices such as particle image velocimetry (PIV), 
laser doppler velocimetry (LDV), etc. have all been applied to investigate fl uid fl ow 
phenomena in water models of argon-stirred ladles.
Objective
To scale down an industrial-scale ladle gas injection operations described in 
Table 10.1 [4] and observe visually the characteristics of the gas injection-induced 
motion.
* A vast majority of such processing operations is essentially melt phase transport controlled and hence 
intensity of stirring plays crucial role in determining the associated rate.

10.2.2  MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN A SOLID AND A LIQUID 
IN A GAS-STIRRED LADLE
Mass transfer between solid additions and bulk liquid steel is an integral feature of 
numerous processing operations carried out in steelmaking furnaces, ladles, and 
so on. For example, ferroalloys and/or deoxidizer additions are routine added to 
molten steel in ladles following tapping to adjust bath chemistry. A situation close 
to pure dissolution (i.e., mass transfer) exists with class II ferroalloys (Section 6.3) 
whose melting points are greater than that of the bulk liquid steel. As the rate of 
dissolution is typically controlled by the rate of transport across the concentration 
boundary layer, fl uid fl ow exerts considerable infl uence on the kinetics of dissolu-
tion. Numerous model investigations have been carried out in the past to quantify the 
infl uence of fl ow on the kinetics of ferroalloy dissolution. It is now well known that 
gas injection promotes stirring and exacerbates the rate of dissolution.
Objective
To estimate mass transfer coeffi cient for a solid dissolving in a gas-stirred bath by 
weight loss method and to investigate the infl uence of gas injection rate on the kinet-
ics of solid–liquid mass transfer.
  

Practice Sessions on Physical and Mathematical Modeling 
421
Equipments and Material
The experimental setup in Section 10.2.1 is readily adopted with some modifi cations 
to study dissolution of a solid. The following additional material and equipment are 
needed:
 
1. At least three numbers of small, cylindrical-shaped benzoic acid compacts* 
(10 mm diameter and at least 40 mm height)† and a rigid facility for their 
suspension within the plume region of the bath.
 
2. A blower drier, a high precision balance, plastic conduits, and a few clamps.
Procedure
Fill up the model ladle with water up to a depth of 0.25 m and start air fl ow at a rate 
of 5 × 10−5 m3/s (= 3 L/min). Inject air for a few minutes to stabilize the fl ow. Take a 
benzoic acid compact and record its initial weight and diameter. Measure diameter 
at several locations and obtain a representative average value. Suspend the compact 
within the plume region of the bath as shown in Figure 10.2 with a suitably designed 
facility. Ensure that the sample is aligned with the axis of the vessel and is suspended 
in a region, at least 50 mm from the bottom of the vessel, i.e., within the buoyancy 
region of the plume (Figure 2.22). Remove the compact from the bath after 300 s. 
Following a thorough drying,‡ record its new weight together with the amount dis-
solved. Immerse the compact at the same location in the bath and measure the amount 
dissolved during the next 300 s. In this way, measure the amount dissolved every 
300 s up to a maximum time of 1500 s. Repeat observations with the remaining com-
pacts at two other gas fl ow rates, i.e., 1.66 × 10−5 and 1 × 10−4 m3/s (= 1 and 6 L/min, 
respectively). Monitor water temperature during the course of experiment with a 
thermometer.
Report
 
1. Summarize the average initial weight, radius, and length of each sample in 
a tabular form. In this, note down the position of the compacts as accurately 
as possible.
 
2. Translate the measured weight after each interval to a corresponding radius 
and summarize this in a tabular form. Apply a density of benzoic acid equal 
to 1260 kg/m3.

† It will be appropriate to cover the top and bottom surface of the compacts with aluminum foil, etc. such 
that only radial mass transfer is signifi cant.

in the compacts, which often is a source of uncertainty in such experimentation.

10.2.3 MIXING TIME IN A GAS-STIRRED LADLE
Mixing is important because it tends to eliminate nonuniformities or gradients in 
concentration and temperature prevailing often in molten steel processing units. 
Mixing enhances chemical reaction by bringing reactants together and removing 
products from reaction site. The state of mixing in a steelmaking reactor is a good 
indicator of the overall process effi ciency.
Bulk motion of the liquid associated with turbulence is responsible for long-range 
mixing (i.e., macromixing). Turbulence leads to disintegration of large fl uid packets 
into smaller “clumps.” Dispersion of such clumps assists in mixing and is gener-
ally termed as the eddy diffusion process of mixing. The disintegration of clumps 
however does not continue indefi nitely. Beyond a particular size, viscous forces pre-
vent further shearing of such clumps of fl uid. Even at this stage, the liquid is not 
“perfectly mixed” and inhomogeneities do exist at the microscopic level. Further 
homogenization (i.e., micromixing) is possible only by molecular diffusion, which 
is an extremely slow process. Therefore, from a practical view point, mixing studies 
are generally concerned with macromixing.
The effi ciency of mixing depends on fl ow and turbulence and is therefore, a strong 
function of the operating conditions. For example, in gas-stirred ladle system, the 
operating fl ow rate, vessel dimensions, number and position of plugs, etc. infl uence 
bath mixing to a varied degree. Steelmakers frequently use “mixing times” to quan-
tify the state of mixing. These are generally defi ned as the time required to attain a 
given degree homogeneity, i.e., typically within ±5% of the well mixed value. Since 
the rate of mixing varies from one location to another, a unique, characteristic mix-
ing time of the system is obtained by monitoring the extent of homogeneity within 
a slowly moving region. Mixing time thus obtained is the longest* and is popularly 
referred to as the “bulk mixing time.” The principle of deducing 95% mixing time 
from an experimentally determined concentration vs. time profi le is illustrated in 
Figure 10.3.
Objective
To measure 95% bulk mixing times in a scaled water model of an argon-stirred ladle 
as a function of the gas fl ow rate and liquid depth.
Equipments and Material
The model ladle together with the gas injection arrangements employed in Sections 
10.2.1 and 10.2.2 is readily adapted to investigate liquid mixing. The following 
 additional equipments and material are however needed:
* Slowly moving regions are the last to become homogeneous.
  

424 
Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
 
1. An electrical conductivity probe, a digital conductivity meter, and a desktop 
computer for monitoring bath conductivity as a function of time
 
2. Suffi cient amount of solution of a common electrolyte such as KCl or NaCl, 
etc. in appropriate concentration*
 
3. Small accessories like a measuring cylinder, glass beaker, etc.
Procedure
Fill up the model ladle with water up to a depth of 0.20 m and start gas fl ow at a rate 
3.33 × 10−5 m3/s (~2 L/min). Immerse the conductivity probe inside the bath such that 
its tip is located in a region close to the junction of the bottom and side walls of the 
vessel (approximately in the vicinity of say, 
0.07
z L =
 and 
0.93
r R =
). Connect the 
conductivity probe to the desktop computer via the conductivity meter. Inject air for 
a few minutes and allow the fl ow in the tank to stabilize.
Measure out a small amount (~15 mL) of the electrolytic solution in a small bea-
ker and add instantaneously over the eye of the surfacing plume. Simultaneously, start 
recording conductivity. Continue monitoring till the bath is homogeneous and a uni-
form conductivity is registered by the measuring probe for some time. This completes 
one observation. For representative result, repeat measurements for fi ve times. Empty 
* For reliable measurements, the response from the conductivity probe must be reasonably intense 
and therefore, correct amount of solution in appropriate concentration is required to be added to 
the bath. Prior calibration is generally needed to ascertain these. Note that tracer density does 
infl uence measured mixing times to some extent (Section 6.7).

10.2.4  RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTIONS (RTD) IN A SINGLE-STRAND SLAB 
CASTER TUNDISH UNDER STEADY-STATE CONDITION
Metallurgical performance (i.e., inclusion fl oat out, thermal mixing, slag emulsifi -
cation, and entrainment, etc.) of a steelmaking tundish depends strongly on fl uid 
fl ow. Tundish geometry and fl ow modifi ers (i.e., pouring box, dam, etc.) infl uence 
melt fl ow and thereby exert considerable infl uence on tundish process performance. 
Incorporating suitable fl ow modifi ers and placing these at strategic locations, fl ows 
in a given tundish could be favorably altered. Optimal designs of such fl ow modi-
fi ers however are rarely deduced from plant-scale trials. Aqueous models have been 
generally applied to evolve suitable designs and identify optimal location of fl ow 
modifi ers in a steelmaking tundish system.
RTD measurements are frequently carried out to evaluate hydrodynamic per-
formance of a steelmaking tundish. To experimentally investigate RTD, a pulse 
tracer is injected through the ladle shroud and its concentration measured as a 
function of time at the tundish outlet. On the basis of the concentration vs. time 
variation,* such as the one shown in Figure 10.4, mean residence time, fl ow vol-
umes, i.e., plug fl ow, well mixed fl ow, etc. are estimated from the theory of RTD. 
The proportions of fl ow volumes thus estimated provide useful insight of such 
phenomena as, inclusion fl oat out, thermal mixing, etc.
* Concentration vs. time plots are known as “RTD” or simply, “C” curves.

2. Position the pouring box centrally around the shroud at the base of the

4. Operate the tundish at the desired fl ow rate and ensure that the head of 
liquid in tundish is scaled in accordance with the height of liquid steel in the 
full-scale tundish.* Make minor adjustment to the fl ow, if necessary. Allow 
suffi cient time for the fl ow to stabilize.
* At the given fl ow rate, the height of liquid in the model corresponds to that in the full scale, provided 
outfl ow from the tundish is regulated properly. The nozzle diameter required to accomplish this is esti-
mated reasonably accurately from the macroscopic energy balance. Incorporation of a correct nozzle 
size in the water model tundish ensures complete geometrical and dynamic similarity.

10.2.5  VORTEX FORMATION AND SLAG ENTRAINMENT DURING 
THE FINAL STAGE OF A SEQUENCE CASTING
Vortex formation and entrainment of the overlying slag are common features in 
tapping and teeming operations. For example, during tapping of the basic oxygen 
furnace (BOF) and the electric arc furnace (EAF), steelmaking slag is invariably 
carried over to holding ladles. Similarly, slag entrainment from ladle to tundish and 
from tundish to mold is frequently encountered during continuous casting of steel. 
Contamination with carried over and ladle slags is to be avoided as far as possible as 
these are known to impair quality of the fi nal product.
  

Practice Sessions on Physical and Mathematical Modeling 
429
As a steelmaking furnace or a ladle is emptied, funnel vortex forms, once the 
level of molten steel falls below a threshold level. This is described in Section 3.8.4. 
Similarly, during the fi nal stage of a sequence casting,* as the level of liquid steel in a 
tundish falls below a critical height, entrainment of deleterious upper slag phase into 
the mold results. Therefore the entire volume of molten steel present in the tundish is 
often not drained out.† This directly affects yield and hence plant productivity.
Objective
To study slag entrainment and vortex formation phenomena in a water model tundish.
Equipments and Material
 
1. Two different lighter liquids such as an oil (i.e., vegetable oil) and an 
organic liquid (i.e., n-pentane) in suffi cient volume to result in a ~10 mm 
thick layer above the fl owing water in the 0.15 scale tundish
 
2. Two additional nozzles having diameter 25% and 50% greater than the one 
employed ian Section 10.2.4
 
3. Digital camera, measuring scale, etc.
Procedure
 
1. Depending on the nozzle size, adjust the infl ow rate of water till a steady 
bath depth of about 100 mm results. In all subsequent observations, main-
tain liquid head at the same level.
 
2. As the tundish is operated under a steady state, carefully and slowly pour one 
of the lighter liquids on top of fl owing water to make a 10 mm thick layer.
 
3. Allow the system to stabilize for a few minutes and then stop the fl ow of 
water into the tundish. As the tundish is drained out, observe carefully the 
region immediately above the exit nozzle.
 
4. Note down the residual height of liquid at which instabilities at the oil/ 
n-pentate–water interface lead to entrainment of the upper phase forming 
thereby a slag vortex above the exit nozzle.
 
5. Record the residual height of liquid at which slag vortex becomes fully 
developed causing widespread, continuous entrainment of the upper phase 
liquid. Take a few snapshots of the developing and the fully developed 
“slag vortices.”
 
6. Stop outfl ow from the tundish to prevent further drainage of the upper phase 
liquid. Refi ll tundish up to the desired level and replenish the upper phase 
liquid if necessary. Start the fl ow and repeat steps 3 through 5 twice more.
 
7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 with the remaining nozzle sizes.
 
8. Drain out the upper phase liquid completely. Refi ll tundish with fresh water 
and repeat steps 1 through 7 with the second lighter liquid. Finally, repeat 
all experiments in the absence of any upper phase liquid.
* Several heats of the same grade of steel are typically continuously cast through a single tundish.
† Widespread entrainment of tundish slag into slab caster molds is known to pose serious operational problems 
including breakouts. Due to such some residual steel is always left in the tundish at the end of a casting.

10.3 PRACTICE SESSION ON MATHEMATICAL MODELING
In this section, a set of 5 different problems including fl ows in a cubic cavity, 
 thermogravimetric setup and three industrially relevant processes are posed. The 
objective is to familiarize readers with mathematical modeling and provide them with 
an opportunity to learn and maneuver commercial software effi ciently. As such, the 
problems are straightforward and do not require much a priori expertise, particularly if 
advantage is taken of the available CFD software. Necessary guide lines on how these 
problems are implemented in Fluent have also been included in the discussion.*
10.3.1  LAMINAR FLOW IN AN ENCLOSED CUBIC CAVITY 
WITH ONE MOVING WALL
Benchmark simulations are carried out routinely to assess the adequacy and appro-
priateness of fl ow calculation procedures. One such problem, frequently used in 
CFD, is the steady, laminar fl ow in an enclosed cubic cavity with a moving wall. 
 Well-accepted solutions of velocity fi elds [9] exist for different values of Reynolds 
number (= vwallLc/ν) and form a basis for evaluating the reliability of the fl ow calcula-
tion procedure developed.
Problem Statement
Figure 10.6 shows a cubic cavity with its upper wall moving in the +x-direction with 
a constant velocity. The moving wall sets the fl uid, initially at rest, in motion within

the enclosed cavity. It is desired to numerically compute steady, laminar, incom-
pressible, and constant property fl ow in the cubic cavity at Re = 100.
Implementation in Fluent
A cubic cavity with an edge length of 1 m and one of its faces moving with a constant 
velocity of 1 m/s is shown in Figure 10.6. Given the Reynolds number of the fl ow (Re = 
vwallLc/ν) is 100, kinematic viscosity of the fl uid contained in the cavity is consequently 
(100)−1 or 0.01 m2/s. Such considerations are helpful and conform to a dimensionless 
format allowing easy generalization of results. On the basis of the above, we can 
conveniently implement the fl ow problem in Fluent, as described below.
Draw the cubic cavity in GAMBIT using the volume drawing tool. Create mesh 
with quadrilateral face elements and hexahedral volume elements such that it will 
result in a 30 × 30 × 30 grid system or nearly 27,000 nodal elements. Declare vari-
ous surfaces (walls)* and the continuum (fl uid) through the main menu “Zones” and 
select the desired version of the solver. Export the resultant mesh fi le to Fluent.
Open Fluent, select the 3-D version, and read the mesh fi le. Pick “Grid” from the 
main menu and carry out a routine grid checkup. Through the main menu “Defi ne,” 
confi gure the solver (this solves the equation of continuity and momentum). There, 
select a steady and segregated solver retaining the remaining default settings. Move 
on to the “Materials” panel and create a fl uid with an arbitrary but realistic density and 
viscosity such that kinematic viscosity is equal to 0.01 m2/s. The default mode of fl ow 
calculation in Fluent is laminar and isothermal. Therefore, no declaration on these 
is required. Set the translational velocity (i.e., both magnitude and direction) of the

10.3.2 LAMINAR FLOW IN A THERMOGRAVIMETRIC SETUP
Thermogravimetric apparatus is widely used in reaction kinetic studies in pyro-
metallurgy (e.g., reduction of metal oxides, sulfi des, etc.). A typical setup primar-
ily comprises a tube furnace (i.e., the reaction chamber) and a precision balance, 
used together for measuring the weight or force at elevated temperature. A typical 
 thermogravimetric setup is schematically shown in Figure 10.8. There, a vertical 
tubular furnace houses a cylindrical-shaped crucible containing a solid sample, a 
 vibration-dampening solid cylinder, a thermocouple and a gas injection device. The 
fl owing gas reacts with the contents of the crucible changing its apparent weight. 
Key kinetic data are thus derived and based on this, order and rate of reaction are 
determined. The gas fl owing through the furnace chamber also exerts a drag force on 
the crucible. Although not directly relevant to reaction kinetic studies, the drag forces 
acting on such systems are of considerable fundamental interest and are measured 
using a precision balance [10].
* We do not invoke gravity in the “operating condition” panel, since fl ow calculations are generally car-
ried out with a dynamic pressure referenced to the local hydrostatic pressure.
† Allowable residuals, under relaxation parameters and their values, the type of differencing schemes 
and P–V algorithms, etc. in Fluent need not be always declared. Instead, one can conveniently work 
with the set of default prescriptions, which are generally adequate for many simple fl ow problems, such 
as the present one.
‡ Numerical solutions depend strongly on grid distribution. Therefore, for every problem of interest, 
there is need to study the infl uence of grid distribution on the accuracy of computed results.

Problem Statement
To predict steady, three dimensional, incompressible and constant property fl ow in a 
thermogravimetric setup and compute the drag forces acting on the crucible wall. As 
the gas fl ow rate employed is small, and furthermore, dimensions of the furnace are 
not appreciable, a laminar fl ow condition is assumed to prevail. The entire system is 
also assumed to be at a constant temperature. The operating gas fl ow rates and tem-
perature together with measured drag forces [10] are summarized in Table 10.3.
Implementation in Fluent
Create the geometry in GAMBIT according to the dimensions in Figure 10.8. For 
the sake of simplicity, the hanging wires may be ignored. Draw the tube furnace, the 
cylinders, the thermocouple and the gas injection nozzle using appropriate drawing 
tools. Use bullion operations to connect or subtract various volumes (viz., thermo-
couple, etc.) to and from the main body of the tube furnace. Once the geometry is 
completed, mesh the fl ow domain. Deploy a suffi ciently fi ne mesh having as many 
hexahedral volume elements as possible. Note that calculation of drag forces on sta-
tionary walls is sensitive to grid in their immediate neighborhood. Declare various 
surfaces e.g., wall, fl ow inlet, outfl ow, etc. and specify the continuum in “Zones.” 
For the ease of computation of drag forces on the crucible, declare crucible surfaces 
collectively as a separate wall entity. Select the version of the “Solver” and export the 
resultant mesh fi le to Fluent.
Open Fluent, select the 3-D version, and read the mesh fi le. Pick “Grid” from the 
main menu and carry out a routine grid checkup. Confi gure the solver through the 
main menu “Defi ne” as per the characteristics of the fl ow problem mentioned earlier.

10.3.3  FLOW AND TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN AN INDUSTRIAL TUNDISH 
UNDER STEADY OPERATING CONDITION
Heat loss through the refractory-lined walls as well as the free surface often produces 
noticeable drop in temperature in a steelmaking tundish. In practice, depending on 
the operating conditions, tundish size, and geometry, the temperature drop between 
shroud and strand could range from 5 to 15 K affecting directly the fi nal superheat with 
which molten steel is delivered into continuous casting molds. The latter is important 
and exerts considerable infl uence on the soundness and internal homogeneity of the 
continuously cast products. For example, segregation, equiaxed structure, etc. are 
strong functions of superheat. Mathematical modeling can provide useful insight into 
temperature distribution in tundish and the attendant superheat in the mold.
Problem Statement
To predict temperature distribution in a slab caster tundish under steady state condi-
tion and compare the same with experimental measurements reported in the litera-
ture [11]. As typical casting rates are often appreciable and kinematic viscosity of 
molten steel is small, fl ow in tundish can be considered to be generally turbulent. 
Furthermore, to accommodate free convection effects in the calculation scheme, 
fl ow and heat transfer have been assumed to be mutually coupled.* Principal dimen-
sions and operating parameters are summarized in Table 10.2 while a schematic of 
the slab casting tundish is shown in Figure 10.9.
Implementation in Fluent
Create the tundish geometry in GAMBIT according to the dimensions in Table 10.2 
considering a uniform wall inclination of 8° all around. Draw a 800 mm × 800 mm 
pouring box having a height of 130 mm considering an open top area of about 
650 mm × 650 mm. Connect the pouring box with the main body of the tundish 
through appropriate bullion operation. In a similar way, draw the shroud and the 
dam and connect these to the main body of the tundish. Mesh the geometry with 
suitable meshing schemes and declare relevant surfaces as wall, outfl ow, velocity 
inlet, etc. as indicated in Figure 10.9. Specify the continuum and select the desired 
version of the solver. Finally, save your work and export the mesh fi le to Fluent.
Open Fluent, select the 3-D version, and read the mesh fi le. Pick “Grid” from the 
main menu and carry out a routine grid checkup. Confi gure the solver through the 
main menu “Defi ne” according to the characteristics of the problem mentioned ear-
lier. There, select a steady and segregated solver while retaining other default settings. 
Select the k–ε turbulence model with standard wall functions from the “Viscous” 
module available under the menu “Models.” Similarly, enable “Energy” to carry out 
heat transfer calculations. Select steel from the “Materials” panel and apply default 
values of density and viscosity; invoke Boussinesq’s approximation.† Prescribe 
fl ow, turbulence, and thermal parameters at the various surfaces via the “Boundary 
* The intensity of fl ow in a tundish varies appreciably from the shroud to the strand. Thus, free convection 
effects are likely to assume some importance in regions with low velocity. This implies that fl ow and 
heat transfer are to be treated as mutually coupled in order to realistically compute fl ows in a tundish.
† This is to embody thermal free convection in the calculation scheme.

condition” panel. There, for example, at the fl ow inlet, apply the velocity and tempera-
ture of the incoming liquid but retain the default prescriptions for k and ε. Similarly, 
at all the stationary walls, specify a no-slip condition on fl ow and a constant heat fl ux 
on thermal energy balance equation according to Figure 10.9. In addition, at the free 
surface, apply symmetry-like condition on fl ow and a constant heat fl ux on energy.* 
Retain default settings on gravity and pressure in the “Operating condition” panel and 
proceed to the “Solution” menu. Initialize the problem with default values of under 
relaxation parameters, convergence criteria, P–V algorithm, etc. Finally, specify a 
reasonably large number of iterations and initiate numerical computation.
Once a converged solution is obtained, write the case and the data fi le. Create a 
small volume element in the vicinity of x = 0.225 m (from the center of the tundish), 
y = 0 m and z = 0.7294 m, the location of temperature measurements. Write a journal 
fi le to repeat calculations for different inlet temperatures shown in Table 10.4.

1. Study the convergence history from variation of residuals as a function of 
iteration. Note down the maximum number of iterations to convergence and 
corresponding computational time in each case. Observe the trends with 
reference to the two preceding laminar fl ow computations.
 
2. Create the central vertical plane in “Surface” and generate a vector plot via the 
“Display” menu. Observe the gross movement of the fl uid as well as the inten-
sity of fl ow on this plane from the shroud toward the strand. Save the vector 
plot through the “hard copy” option available under main menu “File.”
 
3. Estimate the volume average temperature in the vicinity of the monitor-
ing location using the appropriate option available under the main menu

10.3.4  STEADY, TURBULENT FLOW IN A WATER MODEL 
OF A SLAB CASTER MOLD
Fluid fl ow in continuous casting molds infl uences heat transfer and solidifi cation 
patterns, entrainment of overlying mold fl ux/powders, meniscus disturbances (this 
causes entrapment of slag droplets/particles and bubbles), etc. and thereby affects the 
quality of steel produced. Numerous computational and experimental studies have 
therefore been carried out to quantify the role of fl uid fl ow phenomena in continu-
ous casting. As in-mold measurements are diffi cult, experimental fl ows derived from 
water models have often been applied to demonstrate the validity of mathematical 
models.
Problem Statement
Flow of molten steel in a continuous casting mold is highly complex and involves 
multiphysics including multiphase heat, mass and momentum transfer, unsteady tur-
bulence (Section 5.3.1), free surface fl ows, and solidifi cation. On the other hand, 
fl ows in a water model mold are much simplistic as there is no counterpart of heat 
fl ow, solidifi cation, etc. in a water model. Modeling effort is therefore signifi cantly 
smaller as far as prediction of fl ow in a water model of a slab caster mold is concerned 
wherein an isothermal, single-phase turbulent fl ow model is reasonably adequate. In 
the following paragraphs, we make one more idealization and treat turbulence to

steady, isothermal, turbulent fl ow in a slab caster mold. Principal dimensions and 
operating characteristics are summarized in Table 10.5 [12].

Draw the SEN geometry and position it symmetrically at the specifi ed location within the 
mold using the “move volume” feature available in GAMBIT. Connect the SEN with the 
mold through an appropriate bullion operation and mesh the volumes with suitable mesh-
ing schemes, starting with an edge or a face. Declare appropriate boundaries as wall, out-
let, inlet, and free surface and specify the continuum through “Zones.” Select the desired 
version of the solver, i.e., Fluent 6.2. Finally, save your work and export the mesh fi le.

10.3.5 FLUID FLOW AND MIXING IN A GAS-STIRRED LADLE
Argon or nitrogen injection into melts contained in ladles, torpedoes, or transfer 
vessels is routinely practiced to eliminate thermal, chemical, and particulate inho-
mogeneities, to melt or dissolve solid afdditions, to exacerbate slag–metal reactions, 
and so on. Typically one or two porous plugs, located at the base of a ladle, are used 
to deliver the gas. The injected gas, given its buoyancy, rises to the free surface and 
induces a turbulent recirculatory fl ow in the ladle, promoting the rates of various 
heat and mass transfer controlled processes such as those mentioned above. The 
effi ciency of gas stirring is customarily evaluated by studying mixing in the bulk of 
liquid, quantifi ed in terms of a mixing time. A smaller mixing time implies better 
process effi ciency and vice versa (Sections 6.7.1 and 8.3.4).
Problem Statement
To mathematically model fl uid fl ow and mixing phenomena in a dual plug-stirred ladle

turbulent. Numerical computation of mixing necessitates solution of a transient spe-
cies conservation equation in the presence of a steady, turbulent fl ow fi led. The fl ow 
* Gas-stirred ladles involve fl ows of three phases namely melt, slag, and gas. If the presence of slag is 
ignored, any two-phase calculation procedures suffi ce as far as the prediction of fl ows is concerned.

and species transport equations are usually coupled one way* and hence the fl ow 
 calculation precedes. In the following paragraphs, a discrete-phase modeling approach 
(i.e., the Eulerian–Lagrangian procedure, Section 5.3.2.2) is considered to describe the 
gas injection-induced motion and two-phase fl ows. A schematic of the gas-stirred ladle 
system together with its principal dimensions are shown in Figure 10.11.
Implementation in Fluent
Create the geometry of the cylindrical-shaped ladle in GAMBIT. Employ a linear 
grid spacing of about 3–5 mm and mesh the edges. Subsequently, mesh the faces 
and volumes using appropriate mesh building schemes. Declare various surfaces 
(i.e., wall, outfl ow, inlet, and free surface) together with the continuum (i.e., 
fl uid). Select the desired version of solver and export the resultant mesh fi le to 
Fluent.
Open Fluent and select the 3-D version. Read the mesh fi le and check internal 
consistency of the numerical grid. Make the following declarations to setup fl ow and 
mixing calculations.
 
1. Defi ne → Model → Solver
Select a segregated, transient, and implicit “solver.”
* This is true in the case of a neutrally buoyant species. Otherwise, due to density effect, fl ow and scalar 
transport phenomena tend to be mutually coupled.

2. Number of injectors
 
3. Diameter of bubble*
 
4. The mass fl ow rate of gas
 
5. Location of the injectors
Moreover, on the bubbles, apply escape condition at the free surface and rebound 
or refl ect condition at the wall. To complete the statement of the problem, make the 
following declarations:
 
1. Defi ne → Model → Viscous
Select the k–ε turbulence model with standard wall functions.
 
2. Defi ne → Boundary conditions
Prescribe no-slip condition on fl ow and a zero value to k and ε at the solid walls. 
Similarly, at the free surface of the liquid, invoke a symmetry-type condition on fl ow

3. Defi ne → Operating conditions
Retain default settings on operating pressure and gravity.
As far as various numerical control parameters are concerned, retain default spre-

menu and declare the following to initiate species transport calculation:
 
1. Defi ne → Model → Species
Create an appropriate neutrally buoyant mixture template.
* A representative bubble size can be estimated from fl ow rate, nozzle dimensions, etc. on the basis of 
expressions provided in Section 5.3.2.

Modeling of Steelmaking Processes
 
2. Defi ne → Boundary condition
Declare a zero fl ux condition at all the bounding surfaces.
 
3. Solve → Control
De-select fl ow and turbulence.
 
4. Solve → Residual
Prescribe a small allowable residual, preferably smaller than 10−6 or so.
 
5. Solve → Monitor
Create a monitor on volume average species concentration as a function of 
time around the monitoring location (viz., Figure 10.11).* In the monitor panel, 
click on “Write” such that predicted concentration fi eld can be used later to 
estimate 95% mixing times.
Embodying a small incremental step size (~0.01 s or so), begin iteration without 
reinitialization.† Since the species cannot physically escape from the fl ow domain, 
the total amount of tracer is conserved and therefore computational results must 
eventually show a time-invariant trend. This behavior is used to terminate a cal-
culation (or alternatively, you may set a maximum time criterion based on experi-
mental mixing time in Table 10.6). Repeat calculations for all fi ve gas fl ow rates in 
Table 10.6. Save all case and data fi les for postprocessing and subsequent estima-
tion of mixing times.
* In the beginning, as various declarations are made, a monitoring location and a tracer addition point 
are to be created to facilitate numerical estimation of mixing times. Alternatively, to simulate the pulse 
injection of a tracer through the plume eye region, free surface can be segmented and time-varying 
boundary conditions applied.
† This ensures that steady state fl ow and turbulence prevail during species transfer calculation.

10.4 CONCLUDING REMARKS
The practice session developed in the book is intended to provide the readers with 
an opportunity to physically and mathematically model a few simple problems and 
thereby get a direct feel for the subject. Accordingly, a set of 10 problems, relevant 
to the modeling of steelmaking have been formulated and presented in this chapter. 
The problems are designed in such a way that one can work out meaningful solutions 
with reasonable effort and time. Thus while physical modeling setups are possible 
with little resources, numerical simulation on the other hand could be readily car-
ried out via one of the many available CFD platforms. The material presented in the 
chapter is intended to augment learning further providing further insight beyond 
what is possible from Chapters 3 and 4.
