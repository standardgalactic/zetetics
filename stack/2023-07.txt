The steelpan is a pitched percussion instrument that
takes the form of a concave bowl with several
localized dimpled regions of varying curvature.
Each of these localized zones, called notes, can
vibrate independently when struck, and produce a
sustained tone of a well-deﬁned pitch. While the
association of the localized zones with individual
notes has long been known and exploited, the
relationship between the shell geometry and the
strength of the mode conﬁnement remains unclear.
Here, we explore the spectral properties of the
steelpan modelled as a vibrating elastic shell. To
characterize the resulting eigenvalue problem, we
generalize a recently developed theory of localization
landscapes for scalar elliptic operators to the vector-
valued case, and predict the location of conﬁned
eigenmodes by solving a Poisson problem. A ﬁnite-
element discretization of the shell shows that the
localization strength is determined by the difference
in curvature between the note and the surrounding
bowl. In addition to providing an explanation for
how
a
steelpan
operates
as
a
two-dimensional
xylophone, our study provides a geometric principle
for designing localized modes in elastic shells.
1. Introduction
When an elastic structure such as a beam, plate or shell
of uniform curvature is struck, the resulting vibration
quickly propagates as a wave through the entire system.
By contrast, a ﬂat portion of a shell surrounded by
a region of higher curvature may support localized
vibrational modes, i.e. stationary waves which are
conﬁned to a small subregion. This is the basic principle
behind the steelpan, a pitched percussion instrument

originating from the Caribbean approximately a century ago [1]. It consists of a concave playing
surface (referred to as the bowl) joined at the boundary to a cylindrical ‘skirt’, as shown in
ﬁgure 1a. The playing surface has a number of ﬂat or slightly concave regions which are
able to vibrate independently, each with its own pitch (frequency) determined by its size and
shape. These regions are called the notes of the pan, as each one is designed to resonate at
a frequency corresponding to a certain note on the musical scale. The steelpan is played by
striking the notes with a soft-tipped mallet, thus making it analogous to a two-dimensional
pitched xylophone.
Steelpans were originally made from standard 55-gallon steel drums. The bottom face of the
drum is hammered into a concave bowl shape and the notes are deﬁned by locally raising and
ﬂattening the bowl, creating regions of lower curvature. The pans undergo heat treatment in order
to relieve residual stresses and thus achieve global desired metallurgical properties before the
notes are tuned by hammer peening locally. A steelpan may have anywhere between three to
upwards of 30 notes depending on the desired range. In most pans, the notes are arranged in
concentric circles, with the inner notes either circular or elliptical while the outer notes resemble
rounded rectangles (ﬁgure 1a). Part or all of the cylindrical side is retained as the skirt, which acts
as an acoustic bafﬂe, i.e. it prevents the cancellation of sound from the two sides of the bowl
[1]. The steelpan and the crafting process have received considerable interest across multiple
ﬁelds, including acoustics, mechanics and material science [4]. Studies of the steelpan have
predominantly been experimental, and focus on either the materials science and metallurgy of
the construction processes [5], or the measurements of spectra and mode shapes [1,3,6,7] and of
the sound ﬁeld [8].

While the role of localized modes in the acoustics of steelpans has long been known, the
mechanism underlying mode conﬁnement is still incomplete. Steelpan makers conventionally
outline each note with chisel marks and mode conﬁnement has sometimes been ascribed to this
grooving process [4,5]. This explanation was challenged by Maloney, Barlow & Woodhouse [7],
who proposed that mode conﬁnement is a consequence of the steelpan geometry. In a numerical
and experimental modal analysis, they found that a ﬂat circular note region on a hemispherical
pan supports localized modes, suggesting that conﬁnement is inﬂuenced by bowl curvature [7].
Later experimental studies using holographic interferometry reveal a number of normal modes
that are completely localized to a single note region [3]; the mode shapes are qualitatively similar
to those of a ﬂat plate with the same dimensions. In general, the modes are designated by a pair
of numbers (m, n), where m is the number of radial nodal lines and n is the number of nodal
lines perpendicular to the radial direction. The frequency of the fundamental, or (0, 0) mode
determines the pitch, and makers of the steelpan carefully control the geometry to achieve two or
three harmonic overtones. To visualize this, ﬁgure 1b shows experimental images of the (0, 0) and
(0, 1) modes of a C4 note, both displaying strong localization.
A similar mode conﬁnement effect is observed in a related instrument, the musical saw, which
consists of a strip of metal such as the blade of a regular handsaw. When bent into an ‘S-shape’,
a number of localized vibrational modes emerge at the inﬂection line, where the non-vanishing
principal curvature changes sign [9]. Recent work [10] quantiﬁed how the localization strength
varies with the curvature gradient. Moreover, our analysis suggests that these classical conﬁned
modes are topologically protected, analogously to boundary modes in quantum-mechanical
topological insulators.
Here, we characterize how localization in elastic shells arises from variations in the curvature
of doubly curved shells, and characterize the strength of mode localization in the steelpan as a
function of bowl and note curvatures. We model the steelpan as a thin linear elastic shell with an
inhomogeneous curvature, whose dynamics is governed by a set of coupled partial differential
equations. To understand the vibrational properties of the system, we solve an eigenvalue
problem for an idealized version of the pan geometry.
In addition, we introduce an alternative approach based on a generalization of the localization
landscape (LL) method of Filoche & Mayboroda [11]. Originally developed as a geometric
alternative to explain Anderson localization [12] in quantum mechanical systems, one computes
the landscape function associated with the system, whose peaks coincide with the possible
localization regions. In the scalar case, the landscape can be approximated by solving a single
Poisson-like problem for the same operator, a computation which is considerably less expensive
than solving the eigenvalue problem. The approach has been successfully used to analyse
localized modes in various systems described by scalar equations [13–16]. Our generalization
of the technique is applicable to elliptic systems of partial differential equations, which describe a
wide variety of physical phenomena, including shell structures. We demonstrate the method for
a steelpan-like shell with realistic note shapes.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In §2, the landscape theory for scalar PDE is
reviewed and the vector landscape is introduced. In §3, we discuss the shell theory which we
use to model the steelpan. Section 4 describes the methodology of the modal analysis, including
the simpliﬁed pan geometries and the numerical methods. The results are presented in §5.
2. Vector localization landscape for elliptic systems
(a) Review of localization landscape theory for scalar equations
Localization is a phenomenon exhibited by some vibrating systems where a standing wave is
concentrated inside a small part of the domain and almost vanishing outside of it. As a result,
a disturbance at one point of the medium need not propagate to the rest of the system. In the
context of quantum mechanics, a localized wave function describes a particle which is conﬁned
to one region. A familiar example is localization due to a potential well, but the effect is observed

in many less obvious cases. Localization may stem from the domain geometry, for instance due
to a rough or irregular boundary, or when the system is composed of several weakly connected
subdomains [17]. Conﬁned modes can also arise in a disordered medium. The principal example
of this is Anderson localization, where electron wave functions in a crystal are localized in the
presence of a sufﬁciently rough or disordered potential [12].
To study localization in a general setting, we consider an elliptic partial differential operator L
on a domain Ω in Rn and the associated eigenvalue problem Lw = λw. For instance, if L = − +
V is a Schrödinger operator where the potential V is piecewise constant with randomly chosen
values, we obtain a model for Anderson localization. In general, it is not obvious whether any
modes of L are localized or what the localization regions are. The recently developed LL theory of
Filoche & Mayboroda [11] provides a way to predict the conﬁnement properties of low-frequency
modes without solving the full eigenvalue problem. For a symmetric elliptic operator L acting
on scalar functions, they deﬁned the LL as the function L : Ω →R given by L(x) =

Ω|G(x, y)| dy,
where G is the Green’s function of L which satisﬁes the same boundary conditions as imposed in
the eigenvalue problem. In systems which support low-frequency localized modes, the landscape
has one or more peaks, coinciding with the localization regions, separated by valleys, where the
eigenfunctions are necessarily small. This is made precise by the following inequality, satisﬁed by
each eigenpair (λ, w):
|w(x)|
∥w∥L∞(Ω)
≤λL(x),
∀x ∈Ω.
(2.1)
The proof is remarkably short in the case when w is smooth (see [11]): from the deﬁnition of the
Green’s function and the symmetry of L, we have
w(x) =

Ω
LyG(x, y)w(y) dy =

Ω
G(x, y)Lyw(y) dy =

Ω
G(x, y)λw(y) dy,
(2.2)
and thus
|w(x)| ≤λ∥w∥L∞(Ω)

Ω
|G(x, y)| dy.
(2.3)
If w is not necessarily smooth, we replace w(x) by

Ω w(z)ϕε(x −z) dz where ϕε is a molliﬁer.
The inequality (2.1) says, roughly, that w is concentrated in the superlevel set E(λ) = {x ∈
Ω | L(x) ≤λ}. Note that E(λ) may have several connected components, each encompassing a
peak of the landscape L. Therefore, the inequality (2.1) does not by itself guarantee that w is
localized; instead it may be a linear combination of localized functions, each supported in a single
connected component of E(λ). However, numerical experiments [11,14] have shown that typically,
each eigenfunction is localized near a single peak of L, with the following exceptions: (i) two
eigenfunctions with nearly the same eigenvalue can share a peak, and (ii) an eigenfunction may be
spread over two or more peaks that are sufﬁciently close together. This much stronger result has
been made precise and shown rigorously for elliptic operators of the form L = −divA(x)∇+ V(x)
([16], Theorem 5.1).
It should be noted that when the Green’s function is non-negative, as is the case when L
is of second order, L is precisely the solution u to the boundary value problem Lu = 1 on Ω,
which simpliﬁes its computation dramatically. For higher order operators, this is generally not
the case; indeed, this condition fails even for the bilaplacian on certain domains [18]. However, if
the negative part of G is relatively small, one can approximate the landscape by the solution to
Lu = 1 and still obtain qualitatively correct results.
The LL theory has found applications in semiconductor physics [13] and biochemistry [19]
among other ﬁelds. However, many physical systems are described by systems of PDE, to which
the existing landscape theory is not applicable. In particular, this includes the equations of linear
elasticity and the shell equations considered in this paper. In the following section, we state an
appropriate extension of the LL theory to elliptic systems by deﬁning a vector-valued landscape
L and proving a generalization of the inequality (2.1).

(b) Generalization to elliptic systems
To simplify the exposition, we assume homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions throughout.
In the following, ∥·∥and ⟨·, ·⟩denote, respectively, the Euclidean norm and inner product of
vectors or matrices considered as elements of Rm×n.
Let Ω ⊂Rn with n ≥2 be a bounded domain and let L be a second order, symmetric elliptic
operator which acts on vector-valued functions u : Ω →Rm according to
(Lu)i = −∂α(Aαβ
ij ∂βuj) + Bijuj,
(2.4)
where Aαβ
ij , Bij are bounded, measurable functions. Since localization often arises in rough
domains or for systems with highly irregular coefﬁcients, we impose no further regularity
restrictions on Ω or the coefﬁcients. The operator should be understood in the weak sense, as
follows: let H1(Ω) denote the usual Sobolev space of functions f ∈L2(Ω) with weak derivatives in
L2(Ω). The space H1
0(Ω) is the completion in H1(Ω) of C∞
c (Ω), the set of smooth functions with
compact support. Functions in H1
0(Ω) are said to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition in the
weak sense. The action of the operator L and the corresponding bilinear form a is given by
(Lu, v) := a(u, v) =

Ω
Aαβ
ij (x)∂βuj∂αvi + Bijuivj dx,
(2.5)
for any u, v ∈H1
0 := (H1
0(Ω))m. For a vector ﬁeld f, we say that u is a weak solution of the Dirichlet
problem Lu = f, u|∂Ω = 0 if u ∈H1
0 and
a(u, v) = (f, v)
∀v ∈H1
0,
(2.6)
where (f, v) =

Ω f · v dx denotes the inner product on (L2(Ω))m.
The assumption that L is symmetric, meaning that a(u, v) = a(v, u) for all u, v ∈H1
0, is equivalent
to the condition
Aαβ
ij = Aβα
ji
and
Bij = Bji.
(2.7)
In addition, we assume that the bilinear form a is coercive on H1
0, i.e. that for some μ > 0,
a(u, u) ≥μ∥u∥2
H1
0 = μ

Ω

∥∇u∥2 + ∥u∥2
dx,
∀u ∈H1

(2.8)
This holds, for example, if the coefﬁcients satisfy the strong ellipticity condition (see e.g. [20],
ch. 13),

ij (x)ξi
αξj
β ≥c∥ξ∥2,
∀ξ ∈Rm×n,
and
Bij(x)ζ iζ j ≥0,
∀ζ ∈Rm,

(2.9)
for some c > 0 (see also [21] for weaker but more technical conditions). Under these assumptions,
there exists a unique weak solution to the boundary value problem (2.6) for any f ∈[L2(Ω)]m.
As an example, we note that our setting includes in particular the Lamé operator Lu =
−∂α(HαβμνE(u)μν) of three-dimensional linear elasticity (see §3c), and the Naghdi shell operator
of equation (3.13).
In continuum mechanics, one often encounters generalized eigenvalue problems of the form
(cf. equation (3.17))
a(u, v) = λm(u, v),
∀v ∈H1
0.
(2.10)
where the bilinear form m is given by m(u, v) =

Ω⟨M(x)u(x), v(x)⟩dx. We assume that the matrix-
valued function M is positive semideﬁnite for all x and with coefﬁcients in L∞(Ω). Our goal is to
obtain pointwise bounds for the generalized eigenfunctions in terms of integrals of the Green’s
matrix of the system. We repeat here the deﬁnition of the Green’s matrix given in [21], specialized
to our case. In the following, ek denotes the kth standard unit vector in Rm and Br(y) := {x ∈Rn |
∥x −y∥< r} is the open ball with centre y and radius r.
Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that the matrix function G(x, y) = (Gij(x, y))m
i,j=1 deﬁned on {(x, y) ∈Ω ×
Ω | x ̸= y} is the Dirichlet Green’s matrix of L if the following holds:

(i) For all y ∈Ω, G(·, y) is locally integrable and satisﬁes LG(·, y) = δyI in the weak sense, i.e.
a(G(·, y)ek, ϕ) = ϕk(y),
∀ϕ ∈C∞

(2.11)
(ii) For any y ∈Ω and r > 0, G(·, y) ∈H1(Ω \ Br(y))m×m, and G(·, y) vanishes on ∂Ω in the
sense that for every ζ ∈C∞
c (Ω) satisfying ζ|Br(y) ≡1 for some r > 0, we have
(1 −ζ)G(·, y) ∈H1
0(Ω \ Br(y))m×m.

u(x) =

Ω
G(x, y)f(y) dy,
is the unique weak solution in H1
0 to Lu = f.
We note that since L is assumed to be symmetric, G satisﬁes the symmetry relation G(x, y) =
G(y, x)T. Assume that (λ, w) is an eigenpair, i.e. a solution of (2.10), and assume moreover that
w ∈L∞(Ω)m. Then λMw ∈L∞(Ω)m and from property (iii) of deﬁnition (2.1), it follows that the
function u deﬁned by
u(x) =

Ω
G(x, y)λM(y)w(y) dy,
is in H1
0 and satisﬁes Lu = λMw in the sense of distributions. By uniqueness of solutions, it follows
that u = w. Interchanging the roles of x and y and using the symmetry property of the Green’s
matrix, we ﬁnd for the ith component of w

Deﬁning the vector landscape L : Ω →Rm as the vector ﬁeld with components

(2.13)
we obtain the following generalization of the scalar inequality (2.1):

The interpretation is similar to the scalar case: the inequality states that each component of wi
is concentrated in the superlevel set Ei(λ) = {x ∈Ω | Li(x) ≤λ} of the corresponding component of
the vector landscape. Our numerical experiments (§5b) suggest that, at least for some systems,
wi will in fact be localized near a single peak of Li, as in the scalar case. We conjecture that an
analogue of theorem 5.1 in [16] holds also for the vector landscape.

As a concrete example, consider the equations of three-dimensional linear elasticity, equation
(3.12). Then M = I is the identity matrix, and the vector landscape yields a simple upper bound
on the norm of the displacement U:
∥U(x)∥≤λ∥L(x)∥
and
Li(y) =

Ω
∥G(x, y)ei∥dx,
(2.15)
where the eigenfunction has been normalized so that ∥U∥has L∞-norm 1. In the remainder
of the paper, we will consider the eigenvalue problem, equation (3.17), for which M is the
diagonal matrix M = diag(1, 1, 1, 0, 0), and we again obtain an upper bound on the norm of the
displacement:
∥u(x)∥≤λ∥L(x)∥
and
Li(y) =

Ω
∥˜G(x, y)ei∥dx,
(2.16)
where ˜G is the upper-left 3 × 3 submatrix of G and ei ∈R3. Finally, we note that the statement
of proposition 2.2 is easily modiﬁed to account for different boundary conditions, namely by
replacing the Dirichlet Green’s matrix with one satisfying the same boundary conditions as w.
3. The elastic shell model
To apply our generalization of the LL to the steelpan, we modelled it as an elastic shell, i.e. as
a three-dimensional structure which is thin in one direction in comparison with the other two.
As a result of the thinness, the three-dimensional equations of continuum mechanics can be
simpliﬁed to the two-dimensional problem of ﬁnding the deformation of the shell’s midsurface.
Shell theories can be seen as a generalization of the more familiar plate theories, which model ﬂat
bodies, to structures which may be curved in their rest state. Like plates, shells are much weaker to
bending (i.e. isometric deformations) than they are to stretching and shearing. For shells, however,
the membrane (stretching) strains are generally coupled to the bending and shearing strains due
to the curvature of the midsurface. This has a dramatic effect on the mechanics, allowing shells
to resist applied loads more effectively. The curvature of the midsurface also complicates the
analysis: in contrast to plates, the equations describing in-surface and transverse displacements
are coupled, and one must generally work in curvilinear coordinates. Apart from exceptional
cases, the equations of shell theory can only be solved numerically.
There are a number of different shell theories, each based on different physical assumptions;
see for example [22] for an overview. Here, we use a speciﬁc model known as the Naghdi shell
model [23], which allows for extensional and shear deformations of the midsurface, as well as
shear and bending deformations transverse to the midsurface. These kinematical assumptions
are the same as the well-known Reissner–Mindlin model for thin plates [22], to which the Naghdi
model reduces in the special case of a ﬂat midsurface. The choice of model is motivated by
ease of computation: shearable theories such as the Naghdi model require only H1-conforming
ﬁnite elements methods, which are relatively simple to implement and are available in many free
software packages. This should be contrasted with models that do not allow for transverse shear
which give rise to weak formulations with solutions in H2, and thus call for more complicated
H2-conforming or discontinuous Galerkin methods.
We provide a self-contained derivation of the Naghdi equations for completeness, following
[22], leading directly to the equations of motion in weak form, required to apply the ﬁnite-element
method. Since our goal is modal analysis of the steelpan, we limit the discussion to the linearized
theory and clamped boundary conditions. For simplicity, we consider only the case of an isotropic,
homogeneous material of constant thickness.
(a) Differential geometry of deforming shells
The geometry of the shell is speciﬁed by a midsurface, which can deform in response to external
forces, and constant thickness h, which is assumed to always be small compared to the lateral
dimensions and radius of curvature R of the shell (R/h ≫1). The midsurface of the shell in the

undeformed conﬁguration is denoted S and given by a parametrization X0 : Ω0 →R3 where the
reference domain Ω0 is a bounded domain in R2. At any point on the midsurface, the vectors ei =
∂iX0 are linearly independent, and form the covariant basis for the tangent plane. We also deﬁne
the unit normal vector e3 = (e1 × e2)/∥e1 × e2∥. The undeformed shell body is then parametrized
by
R0(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = X0(ξ1, ξ2) + ξ3e3(ξ1, ξ2),

where ξα are the local three-dimensional coordinates within the material. We follow the usual
convention of denoting components of tensors with respect to the covariant basis by superscripts;
we call these the contravariant components. Subscript indices indicate covariant components, which
are components with respect to the contravariant basis (e1, e2), deﬁned by the relation ei · ej = δij.
In this section, Latin indices denote components of two-dimensional surface tensors on the shell’s
midsurface and take the values {1, 2}. Greek indices denote components of three-dimensional
tensors and take values in {1, 2, 3}. Repeated indices are summed according to the Einstein
convention.
The ﬁrst fundamental form a and second fundamental form b of the reference midsurface have
the covariant components
aij = ∂iX0 · ∂jX0
and
bij = e3 · ∂i∂jX0.

The reference area element of the surface is dA =

are raised and lowered using a. For example, the components of a vector V = Viei = Viei are
related by Vi = aijVj. The three-dimensional reference metric tensor gαβ = ∂αR0 · ∂βR0 has a simple

(b) Kinematics
We let U(ξ) be the displacement of the material point of the shell which is initially at R0(ξ) (the
position on the deformed shell is then R = R0 + U). To reduce the dimensionality of the model,
we assume that the displacement U of an arbitrary point of the shell can be speciﬁed in terms of
two vector ﬁelds deﬁned on the midsurface: a displacement vector ﬁeld u and a rotation (θ1, θ2)
of the unit normal vector. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the displacement takes the form
U = uαeα + ξ3θiei.
(3.5)
This is sometimes called the Reissner–Mindlin kinematic assumption. In words, it states that a
material line which is initially normal to the midsurface remains straight and unstretched in
the deformed state, but may be translated and rotated. We see that u is the translation of the
midsurface while θi are the rotations of the material line around the axes deﬁned by the tangent
vectors ei (ﬁgure 2).
The nonlinear three-dimensional strain tensor of the shell is deﬁned by Eαβ = (1/2)(¯gαβ −gαβ),
where ¯gαβ = ∂αR · ∂βR is the metric of the deformed conﬁguration. To leading order in the

Remarks. (i) In the simplest case of a ﬂat plate, the second fundamental form bij vanishes and
equations (3.6)–(3.7) reduce to the usual strain tensor of the Reissner–Mindlin plate model.
Note that in this case, the in-plane membrane strain tensor εij depends only on the in-plane
displacement ui and is uncoupled from the bending and shearing strains. Moreover, we are
free to choose an orthonormal coordinate system so that the covariant derivatives are simply
the usual partial derivatives. (ii) A displacement ﬁeld of the form given in equation (3.5) where
θi = −∇iu3 −bk
i uk is said to satisfy the Kirchhoff–Love kinematic assumption. It is stronger than
the Reissner–Mindlin hypothesis as it imposes that a material line which is normal to the
midsurface in the initial state, remains normal when the shell is deformed. From equation (3.7c),
this is precisely the condition for vanishing transverse shear strains Si. (iii) If the displacement
ﬁeld satisﬁes the Kirchhoff–Love hypothesis and the shell is ﬂat (aij = δij, bij = 0), we obtain the
well-known Kirchhoff–Love plate model.

(c) Governing equations
We derive the dynamical Naghdi equations, starting from the continuum mechanics of a
three-dimensional solid. The constitutive relation for the three-dimensional stress tensor Σαβ =

where Y and ν are, respectively, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the material. Substituting
the expression (3.3) for the three-dimensional metric tensor of the shell, and making the standard
assumption that the normal stress Σ33 vanishes everywhere, we get

Newton’s second law for the three-dimensional shell can be written
ρ∂2
t U = ∇· Σ + F,
(3.11)
where ρ is the mass density and F = Fαeα is an external force density on the shell. To obtain a
weak form of the equations of motion, suitable for the ﬁnite element method, we introduce a test
vector ﬁeld V which satisﬁes the same kinematic assumptions as U, that is, V = vαeα + ξ3ηiei,
and vanishes on the lateral boundary (corresponding to (ξ1, ξ2) ∈∂Ω0) where the displacement
boundary condition U = 0 is prescribed.
Taking the inner product of equation (3.11) with V and integrating by parts, we obtain

where dV =

det(g) dξ1dξ2dξ3 is the volume element of the three-dimensional shell, ˆν is the
outward unit normal vector along the boundary, and dS the boundary area element. The last term
of equation (3.12) represents the effect of boundary tractions, and can be divided into integrals
over the upper and lower faces of the shell (corresponding to ξ3 = ±h/2), and an integral over the
lateral faces. The upper and lower faces of the shell are free, meaning that the traction Σ(U) · ˆν
vanishes. Moreover, V = 0 on the lateral faces as previously noted. Therefore, the last term of
equation (3.12) vanishes for this choice of boundary conditions.
Upon expanding the second term on the left-hand side of equation (3.12) using equations (3.6)–
(3.7) and (3.9)–(3.10), truncating the expression to leading order in the transverse coordinate ξ3,
and integrating over the thickness of the shell, we obtain the dynamic Naghdi equations in weak

It remains to specify an appropriate space of functions V in which to seek the solution. Since the
weak form of the equations, equation (3.13), involves only ﬁrst-order derivatives, this will be a
subspace of the Sobolev space (H1(Ω0))5. In order to impose clamped (homogeneous Dirichlet)

the membrane, bending and shear terms of equation (3.13):

problem associated with (3.13) can be stated succinctly as: ﬁnd pairs (ω2, u) with ω2 > 0, u =
(u, θ) ∈V := (H1

k(u, v) = ω2m(u, v)
for all v ∈V.

For completeness, we mention that the Naghdi equations can also be written as a boundary

Remarks. (i) We note that in equation (3.13), the bending term kb is of higher order in the
thickness h compared to the stretching and shearing terms, a general feature of shell models
[22]. If the thickness h is sufﬁciently small, then any modes with vanishing membrane and
shear strains are energetically favourable. In the linear theory, these pure-bending modes are
characterized by ε = 0, and θ = −(∇u3 + b · u). Existence of pure-bending deformations depends
on the boundary conditions as well as the midsurface reference geometry, in particular the
sign of the Gaussian curvature K = det(b)/ det(a) [22]. Isometric bending deformations are well
understood for surfaces where K has a constant sign, but less is known for surfaces of mixed type
where K changes sign. (ii) If we replace the Reissner–Mindlin kinematic assumptions with the
stronger Kirchhoff–Love assumption, we obtain instead the weak form of Koiter’s equations [22].
While formally simpler, Koiter’s equations are more difﬁcult to solve than Naghdi’s equations
due to being fourth order in space. (iii) In the absence of curvature (i.e. bij = 0), the variational

problem of equation (3.13) splits into two decoupled equations: a membrane problem for the in-
plane displacement (u1, u2) and the remaining variables (u3, θ) satisfy the Reissner–Mindlin plate
equations. If we instead make the Kirchhoff–Love kinematic assumption, which for a ﬂat plate
states that θi = −∇iu3, then the normal displacement u3 satisﬁes a simple bending equation. If
we choose orthonormal coordinates so that aij = δij, we obtain the familiar Kirchhoff–Love plate
equation,

t u3 + B∇4u3 = hF3,
(3.20)
where B = Yh3/[12(1 −ν2)] is the bending stiffness.
4. Steelpan model and numerical simulations
(a) Numerical methods
We discretize the eigenvalue problem, equation (3.17), in space using the ﬁnite element method.
As noted earlier in this section, the weak form of the equations admits solutions in the Sobolev
space H1. However, it is well known that standard H1-conforming ﬁnite-element methods suffer
from numerical locking when applied to shell models. This leads to overstiff behaviour unless an
exceedingly ﬁne mesh is used. Several approaches to alleviate the problem have been proposed,
see [24,25] and references therein. While no method has been rigorously shown to be locking-free
for all situations, numerical tests suggest that many of the known methods can successfully treat
locking in the Naghdi equations. Following [25], we use a high-order partial selective reduced
integration (PSRI) method, a variation of the technique introduced by Arnold & Brezzi [24].
This method was shown in [24] to converge uniformly with respect to the shell thickness under
somewhat restrictive assumptions on the coefﬁcients in the Naghdi model. It has also been found
to perform well on standard benchmark problems.
In the PSRI approach, standard Lagrange ﬁnite elements of degree 2 are used for the
rotations (θi), and Lagrange ﬁnite elements of degree 2 augmented by cubic bubble functions
are used for the components of the displacements (uα). The stiffness form k in equation (3.17)
is modiﬁed by splitting the membrane term km and shear term ks into a weighted sum of two
contributions, one of which is computed with a reduced integration. This way, one avoids the
spurious modes that can appear when employing a full reduced integration. Concretely, we write
km as
α

Ω0
dAhAijkℓεij(u)εkℓ(v) + (1 −α)

Ω0
dAhAijkℓεij(u)εkℓ(v),
and compute the second integral using a reduced quadrature rule of order 2, while the ﬁrst
term is computed with a fourth-order accurate scheme. The shear term ks is similarly modiﬁed.
The splitting parameter α affects the convergence rate, and is chosen as h2/δ2 ≈0.05 where δ is
a typical element circumradius for the mesh, as suggested in [25]. Discretizing equation (3.17)
in the manner just described yields a (generalized) matrix eigenvalue problem which we solve
using the SLEPc implementation of the Krylov–Schur algorithm [26]. The numerical method just
described is implemented in a custom code based on the FEniCS-Shells library [27] and using the
open-source ﬁnite-element computing platform FEniCS [28]. The code is included in electronic
supplementary material [29].
(b) Steelpan model and numerical experiments
Before deploying our method to the steelpan, we note that here are several details of the steelpan
crafting process which are not accounted for in our simpliﬁed model. These include residual
stresses introduced when shaping the pan—partially relieved by annealing—which can strongly
affect the elastic response. A smaller role may also be played by inhomogeneities in the pan’s
thickness and material properties as well as the reinforced skirt of the pan. While these effects

certainly inﬂuence the frequencies and mode shapes, we will show that they are secondary to the
main mechanism underlying acoustic localization that is due to the role played by large variations
in the shell geometry.
To investigate mode conﬁnement in a simpliﬁed model of the steelpan, we performed
two numerical experiments. In the ﬁrst part of our analysis, we consider how the strength
of localization near a note varies with the pan geometry. In the second part, we test the
predictions of the landscape theory developed in §2. In each case, the modes of the structure
are computed by numerically solving the eigenvalue problem (3.17) using the ﬁnite-element
method as described in §4a. Since the localized modes under considerations are insensitive to
boundary conditions, we restrict the analysis to shells with a fully clamped boundary. In all
cases, we use a triangular mesh, with the mesh size chosen so that the modes of interest have
adequately converged; the number of elements is approximately 15 000. We take the constant
thickness of the shell to be h = 1 mm, which is commonly used for these instruments. In our
simulations, we ﬁx the radius of the pan at Rpan = 0.3 m, approximately the radius of a traditional
steelpan. The material properties are Y = 200 GPa, σ = 0.3 and ρ = 7850 kg m−1, typical for mild
steel.
In the ﬁrst experiment, we consider how the localization strength varies with the note and
bowl curvatures. For simplicity, we consider a radially symmetric geometry with a single note
in the centre, shown in ﬁgure 3a. The shape is chosen so that the inner note region and outer
bowl regions each have constant Gaussian curvature, which we deﬁne as κ2
i and κ2
o , respectively.
Speciﬁcally, the inner note region 0 ≤r < a and outer bowl region b < r ≤1 are segments of spheres
with radii Ri = κ−1
i
and Ro = κ−1
o , respectively (ﬁgure 3b). In the transition region a < r < b, we
choose a smooth interpolation between the inner and outer spherical segments to ensure that
the curvature is everywhere deﬁned and continuous. In our experiments, we take a = 0.05 m, b =
0.06 m, so that the note area is less than 5% of the total area of the pan. As we vary the curvatures
κi and κo, we use two different measures to quantify the localization strength of the so-called (0, 0)
mode, which has no nodal lines (ﬁgure 4b). The ﬁrst is the inverse participation ratio (IPR), which
for a mode u = (u, θ) of the shell is deﬁned by

(b) Representative mode shapes corresponding to the points marked in (a). Colour indicates the normalized displacement and
grid lines are shown for clarity. While modes ii and iii have approximately the same L1-norm ratio, the latter has a much larger
inverse participation ratio.
If ∥u∥is approximately constant on a subregion D ⊂S and vanishing outside of D, then
the participation ratio is area(S)/ area(D). We also use another, somewhat ad hoc measure of
localization, which measures the proportion of the mode that lives in the note region N in an
L1-norm sense. If we assume that the mode has been normalized so that ∥u∥has L1-norm 1, then
this is simply
∥u∥L1(N) :=

N
∥u∥dA.
(4.2)
We refer to this measure as the L1-norm ratio (LNR). We note that while the LNR is bounded
above by 1 (achieved by any mode that vanishes outside N), the IPR can be arbitrarily large.
These two measures of localization strength are complimentary: the LNR is more sensitive to
small amplitude oscillations outside of the note region, but unlike the IPR, it gives no information
about how narrowly peaked the mode is inside of N.
In the second experiment, we use the vector landscape of §2 to study mode conﬁnement in
two idealized steelpan geometries, each consisting of a hemispherical bowl with one or more
ﬂat note regions where the curvature vanishes. The (non-dimensionalized) Gaussian curvature
of the bowl is (hκo)2 = 8.2 × 10−4 in both cases. The ﬁrst pan shape, depicted in the top left of
ﬁgure 5a, has a single, circular note of radius 0.05 m in the centre. The second geometry, which
more closely resembles the elaborate designs of real steelpan instruments, has four notes. Three

of those are elliptical inner notes of varying size and eccentricity, placed close together near the
centre. The fourth note is an approximately rectangular outer note near the boundary (ﬁgure 5b).
For each of the two pan shapes, we compute the vector landscape L and several low-frequency
eigenmodes. To compute the value of L at a point y on the shell, we solve the Dirichlet
problem LG(·, y) = δyI for G(·, y) using the ﬁnite-element method and compute the integral in
equation (2.13).
5. Results
(a) Effect of geometry on mode localization
Figure 4a shows the IPR and LNR of the (0, 0) mode as a function of the bowl and note curvatures.
In the region κi > κo, both localization measures are small and approximately constant, indicating
that the mode is extended over most of the pan. Near the diagonal κi = κo, there is a sharp
transition from extended to localized modes which is reﬂected in both the IPR and LNR. Three
representative mode shapes, corresponding to the indicated points i–iii in parameter space, are
shown in ﬁgure 4b.
In the localized region, κi < κo, the two localization measures diverge. The L1-norm ratio seems
to increase monotonically with the difference κo −κi between the outer and inner curvatures. The
IPR, by contrast, is approximately independent of κi in this region, but increases with κo. This
difference can be seen by comparing modes ii and iii in ﬁgure 4b, which are both conﬁned to
the note region with similar L1 norm ratios, but have substantially different values of the IPR.
Therefore, the IPR gives more ﬁne-grained information about the shape of the localized mode in
the note region.
(b) Illustration of the vector landscape
The vector landscape and several lowest eigenmodes were computed for the two shell geometries
described in §4. The results for the single-note pan are shown in ﬁgure 5a. The norm ∥L∥of
the vector landscape is almost vanishing outside of the note region, where it has a sharp peak.
Based on this, we predict that the shell supports one or more localized modes in the note region,
and only high-frequency modes can have substantial amplitude in the outer bowl region. This
is conﬁrmed in the lower half of ﬁgure 5a, which depicts the two lowest-frequency modes of
the shell. The pan has several more localized modes which are not shown here. When a note of
the steelpan is struck, each of the localized modes is excited and contributes to the richness of the
sound. Steelpan makers strive to tune the notes so that the overtones are harmonically related
to (i.e. integer multiples of) the fundamental frequency. Intuitively, it seems that localization is
crucial to this process, since it allows the craftsman to tune each note individually, with only a
minor effect on the neighbouring notes.
Figure 5b shows the more interesting case of a steelpan with multiple notes of varying size
and shape. The vector landscape ∥L∥has several peaks, each located at a note region where the
curvature vanishes. The tallest peak coincides with the large, circular inner note, followed by the
peak at the rectangular outer note. As explained in §2, the landscape inequality (2.14) guarantees
that any low-lying modes must be conﬁned to the union of the note regions. Motivated by the
stronger results which hold for the scalar LL theory, we ask whether each mode is localized to
a single peak of the landscape, and thus a single note. Indeed, this is exactly the behaviour that
we observe in this example. Parts iii–vi of ﬁgure 5b show, in order, eigenmodes 1, 2, 4 and 5 of
the shell. Each mode is strongly localized to one of the four notes of the pan, with an IPR of 99.7,
49.8, 95.7 and 131.4, respectively. We note that each mode shape is reﬂected in the shape of the
corresponding peak of the landscape. Moreover, the relative heights of the peaks is an indicator
of the order in which the localized modes appear. For example, the lowest-frequency mode is
localized to the circular inner note, where the landscape has the tallest peak. The third mode (not
shown) is also located there.

how geometry can lead to effective localization has so far been missing. Inspired by this spectral
problem for the steelpan, we ﬁrst generalized a recent geometric theory for Anderson localization
for linear scalar operators to a vector-valued version. We then used the resulting LL theory to
predict the locations and order of localized modes in doubly curved elastic shells by solving
a Poisson-like problem rather than an eigenvalue problem. Our results show an interesting
connection between curvature and mode conﬁnement in doubly curved elastic shells: shells with
ﬂat regions separated by regions of positive Gaussian curvature support localized modes, and
the strength of localization increases with curvature. It might be pertinent to note that our results
are size and material independent, as the geometric theory of elastic shells is only predicated on
having a large aspect ratio (R/h ≫1). Thus they apply equally to micro- or nanoscale systems, and
are suggestive of applications to high-quality resonators [30]. More generally, our generalization
of the landscape theory to vector-valued systems opens up applications to a much larger class of
systems than previously possible.
