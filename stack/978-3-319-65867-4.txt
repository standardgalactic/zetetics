Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics

Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics (ULNP) publishes authoritative texts covering
topics throughout pure and applied physics. Each title in the series is suitable as a basis for
undergraduate instruction, typically containing practice problems, worked examples, chapter
summaries, and suggestions for further reading.
ULNP titles must provide at least one of the following:
•
An exceptionally clear and concise treatment of a standard undergraduate subject.
•
A solid undergraduate-level introduction to a graduate, advanced, or non-standard subject.
•
A novel perspective or an unusual approach to teaching a subject.
ULNP especially encourages new, original, and idiosyncratic approaches to physics teaching
at the undergraduate level.
The purpose of ULNP is to provide intriguing, absorbing books that will continue to be the
reader’s preferred reference throughout their academic career.

‘You cannot really explain it in the
framework of space and time.’ By God, I was
determined I was going to explain it in the

Preface
This textbook is intended as a lifeline to physics students (of either the traditional or
the autodidactic variety) who have had some preliminary exposure to quantum
mechanics but who want to actually try to make physical and conceptual sense
of the theory in the same way that they have been trained and expected to do when
learning about other areas of physics. Its main goals are (i) to help students
appreciate and understand the concerns that people like Einstein, Schrödinger, and
Bell have had with traditional formulations of the theory and (ii) to introduce
students to the several extant formulations of quantum theory which purport to
address at least some of the concerns and provide candidate accounts of what
quantum theory might actually imply about how the micro-physical world works.
The book grew out of, and its structure in many ways reﬂects, the “special topics
in physics” course on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics that I taught at Smith
College in the Spring of 2016. In this seminar-style course, students would read
through each new chapter (and attempt a few of the end-of-chapter Projects that
I recommended as appropriate pre-class exercises) prior to our weekly three-hour
meeting. During our time together in class, we would discuss the more difﬁcult
concepts and derivations from the text, students would share their (sometimes only
partial) solutions to the assigned pre-class projects (and we would discuss and
complete those as needed), and then we would tackle some additional projects.
Not surprisingly, then, I envision the book being most straightforwardly useful
for a similarly structured elective course in a physics department (or perhaps for a
philosophy-of-physics course focused on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics
in a philosophy department). But the fact that the chapters were created as pre-class
readings (as opposed to transcripts of “lecture notes”) perhaps makes this, com-
pared to most physics textbooks, unusually readable and accessible to individuals
for whom it is not the textbook for any ofﬁcial course—e.g., interested physics
students who are not lucky enough to ﬁnd themselves in a department that offers an
elective course on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, or just anyone with an
interest in the puzzling and fascinating history, philosophy, and, really, physics of
quantum physics.

The book begins with two introductory chapters. Chapter 1 (“Pre-Quantum
Theories”) introduces a number of important concepts and ideas in the context of
classical physics theories such as Newtonian gravity and Maxwellian electrody-
namics. Chapter 2 (“Quantum Examples”) then provides a lightning overview of
some quantum mechanical formalism and examples that serve as a foundation for
later discussions. The level of these two chapters (as well as the rest of the book)
reﬂects the background preparation I was able to expect for the students in my
course at Smith College: they had taken a sophomore-level “modern physics”
course including exposure to Schrödinger’s equation and 1-D wave mechanics
(but had not yet taken, or were in some cases taking concurrently, a junior-level
“quantum mechanics” course using, for example, the text by Grifﬁths); similarly,
they had seen Maxwell’s equations before (in a 100-level introductory course and
perhaps also a 300-level E&M course) and had a fairly strong prior exposure to
vector calculus and differential equations. Still, the students found some of the
material in the two introductory chapters quite fresh and challenging.
Readers who are missing one or more of the prerequisites I just mentioned (or
readers who are pursuing physics outside of, or perhaps decades beyond, any
organized undergraduate physics curriculum) should thus anticipate some struggle
with some mathematical details in the ﬁrst two chapters. However, I want to
reassure people in this category that it will be OK, and that they should get what
they can out of the ﬁrst two chapters and press forward into the rest of the book. Let
me explain my attitude here with an example. I don’t think you can fully appreciate
Bell’s Theorem (the subject of Chap. 8) without digesting, in Chap. 1, the rea-
sonableness of Bell’s formulation of “locality” as a generalization of the speciﬁcally
deterministic sort of local causality exhibited by Maxwellian electrodynamics (in
contrast to Newtonian gravitation). But for readers for whom understanding the
mathematical details is too big a stretch, it will sufﬁce to merely accept that Bell’s
formulation purports to be a natural generalization of the important relativistic
locality of classical E&M.
After the two introductory chapters, the book turns toward the ﬁrst goal men-
tioned above: Helping students appreciate and understand the concerns that people
like Einstein, Schrödinger, and Bell had with traditional formulations of quantum
theory. We begin in Chap. 3 by studying “The Measurement Problem” which was
most famously illustrated by Schrödinger’s infamous cat and then emphasized and
signiﬁcantly clariﬁed by Bell. Chapter 4 tackles “The Locality Problem” which was
most famously brought out in the 1935 paper of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen—
although, as we will discuss in detail, this canonical presentation does not perfectly
capture Einstein’s fundamental objection to the orthodox interpretation. Finally,
Chap. 5 introduces “The Ontology Problem”—a concern that was intensely wor-
rying to Schrödinger, Einstein, and others in the early days of quantum mechanics,
but which has, unfortunately, been largely forgotten in the instrumentalist and
anti-realist wake of the Copenhagen orthodoxy (and which, again unfortunately,
remains under-appreciated even by certain schools of anti-Copenhagen quantum
realism). One of the things I like best about this book is that it gives the ontology
problem pride of place alongside the (more widely recognized) measurement and
viii
Preface

locality problems as one of the “big three” concerns that clearheaded physicists
should have in mind when they are evaluating and developing candidate theories.
Having thus surveyed the central problems that one would hope to see resolved,
the book turns to reviewing and assessing the menu of available resolutions. We
cover, in particular, what I consider the four most important perspectives on
quantum mechanics that curious and intelligent physics students should understand.
These include: in Chap. 6, “The Copenhagen Interpretation” (which is a
self-confessed non-candidate for genuinely explaining micro-physics in an ordi-
nary, realist way, but is of historical and sociological interest nevertheless since it
has been the ofﬁcial, if only superﬁcially understood and half-heartedly accepted,
orthodoxy of the physics community for nearly a century); in Chap. 7,
“The Pilot-Wave Theory” of de Broglie and Bohm; in Chap. 9, “The Spontaneous
Collapse Theory” of Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber, and Pearle; and, ﬁnally, in Chap. 10,
“The Many-Worlds Theory” of Everett. Chapter 8, on “Bell’s Theorem,” is a kind
of sequel to Chap. 4 which explains the Earth-shattering advance that Bell was led
to from his study of the pilot-wave theory.
The material in this second half of the book is, to a large but not perfect extent,
organized historically. Thus, the Copenhagen Interpretation (largely developed in
the 1930s) comes ﬁrst, the pilot-wave theory (originally proposed by de Broglie in
1927 but then largely forgotten until Bohm resurrected the idea in 1952) comes
second, then we turn to Bell’s theorem of 1964 (which, as mentioned, was directly
stimulated by Bell’s contemplation of a seemingly troubling feature of the
pilot-wave theory), and then the spontaneous collapse theories (which only began to
be developed in the 1980s). Everett’s many-worlds theory is presented last, despite
the fact that Everett proposed it in 1957 (between Bohm’s resurrection of the
pilot-wave idea and Bell’s presentation of his important theorem), both because the
theory was not widely recognized as a serious candidate account of quantum
phenomena until much more recently, and also because I think it is hard to recover
from studying something rather surreal and focus on something rather more
mundane!
Note that it might be slightly puzzling that the Copenhagen Interpretation is only
covered (in Chap. 6) after we have reviewed the measurement, locality, and
ontology problems (in Chaps. 3, 4, and 5, respectively)—this despite the fact that
these “problems” were largely raised in response to the interpretive pronounce-
ments of Bohr and Heisenberg and their colleagues. I structured things this way in
part because I assume that students will already have been exposed, as part of a
“modern physics” type course, to the basic Copenhagen philosophy of insisting on
the completeness of the description in terms of wave functions alone (but also,
paradoxically, denying the reality of wave functions) and then foreclosing further
discussion as somehow scientiﬁcally inappropriate. So I thought students would be
able to appreciate the somewhat-reactionary concerns of, for example, Einstein and
Schrödinger, without any explicit prior discussion of the Copenhagen philosophy.
In addition, I think having a clear sense of the critics’ concerns can help motivate
students to actually care about what, exactly, Bohr and Heisenberg said: Did they
really assert what the critics reacted against, and did they have viable answers to the
Preface
ix

criticisms? Finally, I thought that giving Bohr and Heisenberg the last word (after
hearing from the critics) was a good way to try to maintain the neutrality that I have
aimed at throughout the book—despite, perhaps obviously, not thinking very highly
of the Copenhagen philosophy.
In the Smith College course, we went through these topics at a pace of one
chapter per week. That left a couple of weeks at the end of the semester, during
which the students each picked a topic they were individually interested in
exploring further, did some independent reading and research, and then gave a
presentation back to the class summarizing what they had learned and uncovered.
This structure is reﬂected in the present book, which closes with an “Afterword”
that tries to bring an (admittedly limited) element of closure to the covered topics by
summarizing where things stand and then provides an informal laundry list of
recommended topics for further exploration, including pointers to some more
contemporary literature.
I attempt, though, even in the ten chapters of the book, to build bridges to the
primary literature. There is, for example, extensive quoting from the published
papers (as well as the private correspondence) of Einstein, Lorentz, Schrödinger,
Bell, Bohr, Heisenberg, etc., and many of the end-of-chapter Projects invite stu-
dents to read some accessible piece of primary literature and report on things they
ﬁnd interesting or surprising. Indeed, one of my goals with this book is to help
students appreciate the extent to which their own confusions and concerns about
quantum mechanics are not something to feel ashamed of (a feeling that is too-often
the result of the “shut up and calculate” attitude that quantum physics professors
frequently take toward the subjects we cover). Instead, students should feel proud
that they can understand, and indeed in many cases will have anticipated without
realizing it, concerns that were shared by some of the giants of twentieth-century
physics—concerns that have unfortunately been suppressed and forgotten rather
than adequately addressed. To capture the intended spirit of the book in this respect,
I can do no better than quote from an email from my friend Kenny Felder who read
drafts of most of the chapters:
Reading [this], I have I think exactly the sense that you want me to have—or perhaps the
meta-sense that you want me to have—in any case it’s a wonderful sense that I really have
never had before. I have the sense of a group of men who are very smart but perfectly
human, right at the dawn of the quantum revolution, desperately trying to ﬁgure out what
the experimental evidence is actually telling them. I see them throwing ideas around, trying
and rejecting theories, alone and in correspondence with each other. And I get the sense that
somewhere between them and us, that search for a coherent theory more or less evapo-
rated—not because the questions were answered, but more because people kind of forgot
about them—and you’re trying to revitalize that quest. It’s exciting!
Let me ﬁnally say something about the end-of-chapter “Projects” which I consider
to be an essential component of the book, just as they were an essential component
of the course it grew out of. Some of these are rather like traditional end-of-chapter
exercises, which ask students, for example, to ﬁll in gaps in derivations from the
text or apply concepts introduced in the text to simple concrete examples. But many
of the Projects are considerably more challenging and open-ended. For example, as
x
Preface

mentioned above, some invite students to read an article or essay that has been
discussed in the text and report back on things they ﬁnd interesting, surprising, or
novel. Some projects invite students to use Mathematica or another programming
language to create helpful visualizations or numerical solutions of difﬁcult prob-
lems. There are even a few Projects (perhaps most suitable for students using the
text in the context of a traditional course) asking students to interview a few
physicists to get a sense of how real people think about some issue. It is hoped that
the diversity and open-endedness of the Projects will allow students with many
different backgrounds, technical abilities, and interests to stay actively engaged with
the material (before, during, after, and/or without classroom time, as appropriate in
each individual case).
Let me close by thanking Darby Bates, Jean Bricmont, Kira Chase, Kenny
Felder, and Trevor Wright for reading, and providing signiﬁcant helpful feedback
on, earlier versions of at least some of the chapters. I also owe a more generalized
debt of gratitude to my tireless and inspiring wife Sarah, and my kids Finn and Tate,
for helping keep me grounded and happy—as well as to my wonderful parents,
Steve and Carol, for believing and investing in me (especially by supporting my
own undergraduate education at Harvey Mudd College, where my interest in the
subject matter of this book began).

In this introductory chapter we review two theories from classical physics –
Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics – and use them to intro-
duce a number of concepts (such as determinism, locality, ontology, measurement,
and conﬁguration space) that we will explore in the context of quantum mechanics
in subsequent chapters.
1.1
Newtonian Mechanics
As a ﬁrst example of a “pre-quantum theory” let’s consider the picture of the universe
formulated by Isaac Newton. The theory, in a nutshell, says that the physical world
consists of particles interacting by means of forces which the particles exert on one
another and which inﬂuence the particles’ motions. About the particles, Newton
wrote:
...it seems probable to me, that God in the Beginning form’d Matter in solid, massy, hard,
impenetrable, moveable Particles, of such Sizes and Figures, and with such other Properties,
and in such Proportion to Space, as most conduced to the End for which he form’d them;
and that these primitive Particles being Solids, are incomparably harder than any porous
Bodies compounded of them; even so very hard, as never to wear or break in pieces.... [A]ll
material Things seem to have been composed of the hard and solid Particles above-mention’d,
variously associated.... [1, pp. 400–2]
Newton’s endorsement of the idea that observable macroscopic objects are composed
of invisibly small, indestructible particles is a kind of bridge between the speculative
notion of atomism that had been introduced by Ancient Greek philosophers such
as Democritus, and the more scientiﬁc atomic theory of matter that grew out of
chemistry and physics in the centuries following Newton.
Regarding the forces that these particles exert on one another, Newton wrote that
Bodies act one upon another by the Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity; and
these Instances shew the Tenor and Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that

there may be more attractive Powers than these. .... [W]e must learn from the Phaenomena
of Nature what Bodies attract one another, and what are the Laws and Properties of the
Attraction.... The Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity, reach to very sensible
distances, and so have been observed by vulgar Eyes, and there may be others which reach
to so small distances as hitherto escape Observation.... [1, p. 376]
Although he did not have any particular detailed theories about them, Newton thus
anticipated the empirical quest to understand the short-range attractions and repul-
sions between particles that we now think of as responsible for micro-physical,
chemical, and even biological processes. But of course Newton did have a rather well-
worked-out theoretical account of the long-range gravitational interactions between
particles.
According to Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force exerted
on a particle of mass mi located at position ⃗ri, by another particle of mass m j located
at position ⃗r j, is given by
⃗Fi, j = Gmim j
r2
i j
ˆri j
(1.1)
where ri j = |⃗ri −⃗r j| is just the distance between the two particles and
ˆri j = ⃗r j −⃗ri
ri j
(1.2)
is a unit vector pointing along the line from ⃗ri back toward ⃗r j. The gravitational force
between two elementary particles, that is, is proportional to the product of the masses
of the particles, inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, and
is directed back toward the particle exerting the force. The proportionality constant,
G, which we now call “Newton’s constant”, was ﬁrst measured by Cavendish about
a century after Newton.
The total or net force on the ith particle is then
⃗Fnet
i
=

j̸=i
⃗Fi, j.
(1.3)
(Note that here we ignore the existence of other, short-range forces and pretend for
simplicity that the particles only interact gravitationally.) And of course it is this
net force that inﬂuences the particle’s trajectory through space in accordance with
Newton’s second law of motion:
⃗Fnet
i
= mi ⃗ai.
(1.4)
Note that Newton’s inverse square law, Eq.(1.1), also embodies Newton’s third law:
for every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Or more precisely: if j exerts
a force on i, then i necessarily also exerts a force on j, and these two forces (that
they exert on each other) have equal magnitudes but precisely opposite directions.
That is:

(1.5)
It is nice to have some pictures to go along with all the equations, so in Fig.1.1 I’ve
illustrated some of these ideas by showing three particles (which one might think of
as two stars forming a binary star system plus an orbiting planet) and the forces they
exert on one another.
Note that the basic laws of Newtonian mechanics (both the expressions for the
forces and also Newton’s second law which describes how the particles respond
to forces) are postulated as applying fundamentally to the elementary, microscopic
“Particles” that Newton spoke of in the ﬁrst block quote. It is perhaps not terribly
surprising, but important and interesting nevertheless, that these same laws (properly
understood) also turn out to apply to large macroscopic objects like stars and planets
and apples. That is, in Newtonian mechanics, the applicability to macroscopic objects
of (for example) the gravitational inverse square law and Newton’s second law, are
theorems which can be derived from the basic laws (understood as applying to the
elementary Particles) rather than postulates. You are invited to consider this point
further in some of the end-of-chapter Projects.
It is perhaps worth making more explicit that the long-range gravitational forces
exertedoneachparticledepend,accordingtoEq.(1.1),ontheinstantaneous positions
of the distant particles exerting the forces. There is nothing like a delay, for example,
associated with some ﬁnite-speed propagation of the gravitational inﬂuence. The
Newtonian gravitational forces, as described by Eq.(1.1), are thus non-local, by
which we simply mean that they embody what Einstein would describe as a kind of
“spooky action at a distance.” Interestingly, though, Newton himself did not believe
that this apparent non-locality should be taken seriously, as accurately capturing the
true nature of gravitational interactions. In a famous 1693 letter to Richard Bentley,
Newton wrote:
It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something
else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact...
That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act
upon another at a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and

through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great
an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of
thinking can ever fall into it [2].
Newton thus evidently did not regard what we are here calling “Newtonian mechan-
ics”asprovidingacompleteandﬁnaldescriptionofgravitationalinteractions.Instead
he seems to have regarded it as merely a starting point, justiﬁed by its success in
accounting for the observed motions of planets (and comets and tides and falling
apples and so on). And as we will see in the next section, physical theory did ulti-
mately develop along the lines suggested here by Newton, with the “ﬁeld” concept
(and the associated removal of the troubling, if merely apparent, non-locality) that
Faraday and Maxwell introduced into electro-magnetic theory (and then Einstein
introduced into gravitational theory with his general theory of relativity).
Let us close this section with one last ﬁgure, which serves two functions: ﬁrst,
introducing the idea of a “space-time diagram” and, second, illustrating one last
implication of the (perhaps merely apparent) non-locality of Newton’s account of
gravity.
A “space-time diagram” is just a graph of position versus time, but (by conven-
tion) with the time axis running vertically upward in the ﬁgure. Thus, a horizontal
slice through the diagram represents the conﬁguration of objects at some particular
moment in time.1 The curves representing the paths of objects “through space-time”
are called “world-lines”. This probably sounds fancier and deeper than it is; remem-
ber this is just a graph of position versus time, but turned sideways! Fig.1.2 shows
a space-time diagram for the same three-object system illustrated before. One sees
the orbits of the two “stars” in the “binary star system” (about their mutual center
of mass) as the double-helical world lines, with the world line for the (much lighter)
“planet” suggesting a longer-period orbit around the “stars”.
The particular time slice shaded in gray is meant to correspond to the situation
depicted earlier, in Fig.1.1. Note that, because of the dynamical non-locality men-
tioned before, there is a sense in which we must think of this particular “slicing” of
space-time as somehow “objectively real” according to this theory. That is, in order
for the equations of motion of the theory to be well-deﬁned, there must be a real fact
of the matter about which points, on the world lines of the other distant particles, are
simultaneous with the point in question where we want to know the force.
To make this concrete, imagine a tilted slice through the same point on the world
line of the “planet” that the slice in the Figure passes through. The tilted slice would
intersect the world lines of the two “stars” at different points on their world lines,
and therefore the magnitudes and directions of the gravitational forces exerted on the
“planet” at that moment would be different. But the planet is going to move in some
particular way, and this requires that some one of the possible ways of slicing up the
1That is: a particular moment in time from the point of view of some particular reference frame.
Readers who have studied special relativity will recall that due to the relativity of simultaneity, a
slice of space-time representing events occurring at the same time, but for a differently-moving
observer, will appear tilted with respect to the one drawn in the Figure. This will be important
shortly.

space-time into “simultaneity slices” – the one that gives the forces that generate the
planet’s actual trajectory – is dynamically privileged, objectively correct.
But this idea of a special, dynamically privileged reference frame contradicts the
fundamental principle of relativity theory, that all reference frames are equally valid.
Or, as Einstein expressed this point,
There is [according to relativity] no such thing as simultaneity of distant events; consequently
there is also no such thing as immediate action at a distance in the sense of Newtonian
mechanics [3, p. 61].
Newton’s philosophical instincts may rightly have bristled at the idea of instan-
taneous action-at-a-distance, but Einstein’s relativity theory provided, for the ﬁrst
time, a strong physics-based reason for denying the sort of non-locality suggested by
(a naive reading of) Newton’s law of universal gravitation.
1.2
Maxwellian Electrodynamics
Let us then turn to a second example “pre-quantum” theory – the theory of electrically
chargedparticlesinteractingwithelectricandmagneticﬁelds.Webeginforsimplicity
with the case of electrostatics, which is basically parallel to Newtonian gravitation.
According to Coulomb’s law, electrically charged particles exert forces on each other,
with the force exerted on charge i by charge j being
⃗Fi, j = −kqiq j
r2
i j
ˆri j
(1.6)

Pre-Quantum Theories
which is of course just like Newton’s inverse square law for gravity but with the
masses replaced by charges. (The minus sign out front is also different: whereas all
masses are positive and gravitational forces are always attractive, the electrostatic
force between two like charges – either both positive or both negative – is instead
repulsive.) The net electric force on charge i is then
⃗Fnet
i
=

j̸=i
⃗Fi, j.
(1.7)
The concept of electric ﬁeld is often ﬁrst introduced as a kind of calculational tool:
we deﬁne the electric ﬁeld at some location ⃗r as the (net electric) force that a charged
particle would feel if it were located at ⃗r, divided by the charge q of that hypothetical
charged particle. That is:
⃗E(⃗r) =
⃗Fnet(⃗r)
q
(1.8)
(or, perhaps, to take care of a certain technical detail that need not concern us here,
the same thing but in the limit as q →0). Thus, the electric ﬁeld at each point ⃗r can
be written as a sum over contributions from all the charged particles in the universe:
⃗E(⃗r) =
N

i=1
kqi
|⃗r −⃗ri|2 ˆri
(1.9)
where ˆri is a unit vector pointing from the point ⃗ri to the point ⃗r where we are
calculating the electric ﬁeld. This equation embodies what is called the principle of
superposition, which basically means that if charged particle 1 produces a ﬁeld ⃗E1 at
some point (i.e., if only charged particle 1 were around, the electric ﬁeld at that point
would be simply ⃗E1) and charged particle 2 produces a ﬁeld ⃗E2 at that point (i.e., if
only charged particle 2 were around, the electric ﬁeld at that point would be simply
⃗E2), then – with both 1 and 2 around – the ﬁeld is just the sum ⃗E1 + ⃗E2. The concept
of “superposition” plays an important role in quantum mechanics, so we highlight it
here.
It follows from the deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld above that, if a particle with
charge q is located at a point ⃗r where the electric ﬁeld is ⃗E(⃗r), it will feel a force
⃗F = q ⃗E.
(1.10)
So far, the electric ﬁeld should seem like a kind of pointless calculational middle-
man: we say the force on a charged particle is determined by its charge and the
electric ﬁeld at its location, and then the electric ﬁeld at its location is just deﬁned as
the superposition of a bunch of inverse-square-law contributions from all the other
charged particles. Why not just eliminate the middle man and return to Eq.(1.6) with
its apparent “spooky action at a distance”?

1.2 Maxwellian Electrodynamics
7
The answer is that there turns out to be compelling evidence to take the electric
ﬁeld ⃗E(⃗r) – as well as the related magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B(⃗r) – seriously, not as mere
calculational devices to help us compute the forces that the particles exert on each
other, but as geniune physically-real things that can (for example) carry energy and
momentum and other physical properties and so must actually exist in addition to
the charged particles.
It will be helpful to remind ourselves about Maxwell’s equations, which can be
understood as telling us how the electric and magnetic ﬁelds change in response to
the charged particles (and one another). To begin with we have “Gauss’ Law”
⃗∇· ⃗E = ρ
ϵ0
(1.11)
where ρ is the electric charge density. For example, for a set of point charges qi at
positions ⃗ri,wewouldhaveρ(⃗r) = 
i qiδ3(⃗r−⃗ri).Gauss’Lawshouldbeunderstood
as a re-formulation of Coulomb’s Law, which tells us that the electric ﬁeld around a
point charge is radially outward and falls off in magnitude as the inverse square of
the distance. (The ϵ0 is just a constant, related to the constant k that appeared earlier
in Coulomb’s Law according to k =
1
4πϵ0 .)
The second of Maxwell’s equations is sometimes called “Gauss’ Law for Mag-
netism.” It reads
⃗∇· ⃗B = 0
(1.12)
which can be understood as saying that there are no “magnetic charges” (which
produce radially-outward magnetic ﬁelds in the same way that electric charges pro-
duce radially-outward electric ﬁelds). Sometimes this is stated with the assertion
that “there are no magnetic monopoles” or by noting that “magnetic ﬁeld lines never
begin or end but instead make closed loops”.
But if there are no magnetic charges, why do magnetic ﬁelds exist at all? What
produces them? The answer turns out to be: moving electric charges, i.e., electric
currents. This is captured in Ampere’s Law:
⃗∇× ⃗B = μ0 ⃗j + ϵ0μ0
∂⃗E
∂t .
(1.13)
The ⃗j on the right hand side is the electric current density. Again, for example, for
a set of electric point charges moving with velocities ⃗vi, we can write the simple
expression ⃗j = 
i qi ⃗viδ3(⃗r −⃗ri). The μ0 is another fundamental constant. So,
actually, it is only the ﬁrst term on the right hand side which corresponds to what I
wrote just above, that magnetic ﬁelds are produced by moving charges. The second
term(theso-called“displacement current”termthat was famouslyaddedtoAmpere’s
original expression by Maxwell) says that, in addition, changing electric ﬁelds can
produce (or here sometimes one says “induce”) magnetic ﬁelds. Changing electric
ﬁelds, that is, in some sense act just like electric current in so far as they are able to
give rise to magnetic ﬁelds.

8
1
Pre-Quantum Theories
The fourth and ﬁnal Maxwell equation is Faraday’s law, which says that changing
magnetic ﬁelds can also give rise to (“induce”) electric ﬁelds:
⃗∇× ⃗E = −∂⃗B
∂t .
(1.14)
These last two equations taken together imply the existence of propagating (“elec-
tromagnetic”) waves, in which a changing electric ﬁeld at some point stimulates the
appearance of a magnetic ﬁeld at neighboring points, but the coming-into-existence
of this magnetic ﬁeld in turn induces the coming-into-existence of further electric
ﬁelds at still-further neighboring points, and so on. It can be shown that these waves
propagate with speed 1/√ϵ0μ0 which we identify as the speed of light, c:
c =
1
√ϵ0μ0
= 3 × 108 m/s.
(1.15)
Together, as we have said, Maxwell’s equations tell us how the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds respond to (themselves, each other, and) the charged particles. To complete the
formulation of the theory we also need to know how the charged particles respond to
the ﬁelds. This information is contained in the so-called Lorentz Force Law, which
says that a particle of charge q moving with velocity ⃗v at position ⃗r feels a force
⃗F = q ⃗E(⃗r) + q⃗v × ⃗B(⃗r).
(1.16)
which determines the particle’s trajectory according to Newton’s second law.
To summarize, the overall picture of the universe according to Maxwellian elec-
trodynamics involves particles moving through a kind of background “soup” (the
ﬁelds). The ﬁelds inﬂuence the motion of the particles and can be thought of, just as
Newton had suggested, as a kind of space-ﬁlling means or intermediary by which the
particles inﬂuence one another. But the ﬁelds are physically real dynamical objects
in their own right as well.
1.3
Locality
We have already described the (perhaps merely apparently) non-local character of
Newton’s theory of gravity and hinted at the idea that the situation is different in
Maxwellian electrodynamics. Let us explore this further. I mentioned above that
Maxwell’s equations imply the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate
at the speed of light c. It is hardly obvious just looking at Maxwell’s equations, but
actually all electromagnetic interactions as such propagate at speed c (or, in some
situations/senses, slower).
Let’s try to extract this from the equations. To begin with, let’s see how the wave
equations for ⃗E and ⃗B follow from Maxwell’s equations. Taking the curl of Eq.(1.14)

In empty space, where ρ = 0 and ⃗j = 0, this is simply the wave equation for ⃗E:
∇2 ⃗E −1
c2
∂2 ⃗E
∂t2 = 0.
(1.19)
So far so good.
A similar process – beginning by taking the curl of Eq.(1.13) – gives
∇2 ⃗B −1
c2
∂2 ⃗B
∂t2 = −μ0 ⃗∇× ⃗j.
(1.20)
So the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B also satisﬁes the wave equation

∂t2 = 0
(1.21)
in empty space. And note that the two kinds of waves (electric and magnetic) are
necessarilycoupled.Soinemptyspacewehaveelectromagneticwavesthatpropagate
at the speed of light, c.
To understand exactly how electric charges (and moving charges, i.e., electric
currents) affect the surrounding electric and magnetic ﬁelds, however, we should
study Eqs.(1.18) and (1.20) in their full glory, including the source terms on the
right hand sides. To begin with, think of these two equations as six equations, one
for each Cartesian component of the ﬁelds. These six equations all have the same
basic structure, which, for simplicity, we re-write here as follows:
∇2ψ(⃗x, t) −1
c2
∂2ψ(⃗x, t)
∂t2
= f (⃗x, t)
(1.22)
where the function f (⃗x, t) represents the source term. The source term is in fact
some time- or space- derivative of the charge density ρ or the current density ⃗j (or
some combination of such things) but as it turns out the details don’t matter so we
will work in terms of the generic f .

Pre-Quantum Theories
Working out the detailed solution to Eq.(1.22) gets a little bit technical.2 Here we
will try to explain the overall idea and invite you to work through some of the details
in the Projects.
First, it is possible to show that if the source f is concentrated at a single point
(⃗x = ⃗x′) in space and only pops into existence for an instant at t = t′, i.e., if
f (⃗x, t) = δ3(⃗x −⃗x ′) δ(t −t′),

t −

t′ + |⃗x−⃗x′|
c
	
|⃗x −⃗x′|
(1.24)
is a solution of Eq.(1.22).3
What this says, in words, is that the point source at (⃗x ′, t′) gives rise to a non-zero
ﬁeld ψ only where the argument of the δ-function on the right hand side vanishes –
i.e., only at positions ⃗x and times t satisfying
t = t′ + |⃗x −⃗x′|
c
(1.25)
– i.e., only at positions ⃗x and times t which could be reached by a signal propagating
out at the speed of light from the source at ⃗x′ and t′. This set of events should be
thought of as a growing spherical shell that propagates outward from the source
point. But it is often referred to as the “future light cone” of the source point (⃗x′, t′)
because, when plotted in a space-time diagram (with one of the 3 spatial dimensions
suppressed to make room for time!) the points where the ﬁeld ψ is affected form a
cone. See Fig.1.3.
Now, of course, realistic sources f (⃗x, t) are not concentrated at individual points
in space-time. But any realistically distributed source can always be written as an
integral (think: sum) over such point-sources. And then, by the principle of super-
position, the total ﬁeld that these sources produce is just the sum over the ﬁelds that
would be produced by each of the point sources taken individually. That means, if
you think about it, that the total ﬁeld produced at some point (⃗x, t) will involve con-
tributions from all the sources present on the past light cone of (⃗x, t), i.e., from all
the locations in space-time that could “broadcast” an inﬂuence outward at the speed
of light that just reaches (⃗x, t).
See Fig.1.4 for an illustration of the implied picture, of electric charges interacting
in a locally causal way by means of inﬂuences propagating through the ﬁelds. In
2It is explained, for example, in Chap.6 of Jackson [4].
3Note also that there is a second solution proportional to δ

t −

t′ −|⃗x −⃗x′|/c

. Equation (1.24)
is called the “causal” solution because it describes charges and currents affecting the surrounding
ﬁelds in the future; we set aside here the other solution, which describes charges and currents
affecting the surrounding ﬁelds in the past. Finally, if you want to pursue the mathematics in a little
more detail, it will help to know that Eq.(1.24), a solution to the wave equation for a delta-function
source, is called the “Green’s function” for the wave equation.

particular, if for example you want to know what particle 1 does at the point marked

in turn are inﬂuenced by source terms on the past light cone, i.e., what particles 2
and 3 were doing at the points marked (a) and (b).
So far so good. Note, though, that in the language of differential equations, we
have so far only been discussing the “particular solution” of Eq.(1.22) – that is, the
contributionstotheﬁeldsψ whicharisespeciﬁcallyfromnonzerosourceterms f .But
there is always in addition the so-called “complementary solution” – i.e., the solution

12

Pre-Quantum Theories
of the corresponding homogeneous problem. But this part of the general solution is
simple, because the corresponding homogeneous problem is just the ordinary wave
equation whose solutions are electromagnetic waves that propagate at the speed of
light.
Anyway, the point here is that the “general solution” of Eq.(1.22) can be under-
stood as the sum of two things: ﬁrst, contributions from electric charges and currents
at points on the past light cone of the point in question, and then second, contributions
from “freely propagating” electromagnetic waves (which perhaps were themselves
created in the more distant past by wiggling charges, or which perhaps instead have
just always been around since the beginning of time).
To summarize, then, Maxwellian electrodynamics is a completely local theory:
what happens at a given point in space-time depends exclusively on events lying on
(or inside) the past light cone of that event. This is really just a fancy and formal
way of saying that causal inﬂuences always propagate, according to this theory, at
the speed of light (or slower4). And this is in contrast to Newtonian gravity (at least
naively interpreted) in which, as we saw, what happens at a given point in spacetime
depends on things that are happening at that same moment arbitrarily far away.
Note that the local character of Maxwellian electrodynamics makes it compatible
with Einstein’s relativity theory in a way that Newton’s theory of gravity is not.
According to relativity, simultaneity is relative; that is, according to relativity, there
is simply no objective fact of the matter about what set of events are simultaneous with
a given space-time point. And so, from the point of view of relativity, the Newtonian
gravitational idea that the force on a certain particle at a certain moment in time
depends on the instantaneous conﬁguration of all the other particles in the universe,
is literally meaningless. Whereas the idea in Maxwellian electrodynamics, that the
force on a certain particle at a certain moment depends on what other particles were
doing earlier, by exactly the amount required for a signal to propagate at the speed
of light to the particle in question, is perfectly compatible with relativity because the
speed of light is, for relativity, an invariant quantity.
And note that it is essentially the ﬁxing of this problem with Newtonian gravita-
tional theory – namely, removing the nonlocality and thereby making it compatible
with relativity – that Albert Einstein accomplished in his general theory of relativity
in 1915.
Asawayofsummarizingallofthisdiscussion,hereisanicestatementbyEinstein:
The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance
resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous
4How could a causal inﬂuence in electrodynamics ever go slower than light, given what we’ve been
saying here? Well in some fundamental sense it can’t. But it can zig-zag back and forth through
space-time in such a way that each individual “zig” or “zag” goes at the speed of light, but the
overall average speed between the beginning and the end is much slower. As an analogy, if you
throw a ball at a wall and wait for it to bounce back and hit you on the head, there is a sense in which
the causal inﬂuence always propagates at whatever speed the ball was moving... but another sense
in which the average speed, from your throw to your getting bonked in the head, is zero. The same
kind of thing is possible with charged particles replacing you and the wall, and electromagnetic
inﬂuences propagating at the speed of light replacing the ball.

action at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of Newton’s law of
gravitation. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of
light always takes the place of instananeous action at a distance or of action at a distance
with an inﬁnite velocity of transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c
plays a fundamental role in this theory [5, p. 47].
1.4
Bell’s Formulation of “Locality”
In the last section, we sketched the process by which one can extract – from the
fundamental equations of Maxwellian electrodynamics – the theory’s “relativistic
local causality” (or just “locality” for short). The success of relativity theory, though,
has strongly suggested that this sort of relativistic local causality (i.e., the idea that
causal inﬂuences should never propagate faster than the speed of light) is a necessary
property of any acceptable physical theory. So it will be useful, going forward, to have
a “generic” formulation of this idea, i.e., a concept of relativistic local causality that
is not tied to any particular theory like Maxwellian electromagnetism. We therefore
discuss here the formulation provided by John Stewart Bell, whose contributions to
the foundations of quantum theory will show up throughout this book.
Bell begins by noting that Maxwellian electrodynamics has the following prop-
erty: a complete description of the state of all the ﬁelds and charges, on a time-like
“slice” () across the past light cone of some event at (⃗x, t), will determine what
happens at (⃗x, t). The image of a time-like “slice” is illustrated in Fig.1.5. One should
remember, though, that this language – “slice”, suggesting a two-dimensional region

Fig. 1.5 In Maxwellian electrodynamics, a physical event χ at the point (⃗x, t) – for example,
the value of an ⃗E or ⃗B ﬁeld, or the velocity of some particle that arrives there, or the electric
charge density there – is uniquely determined by a complete speciﬁcation (C) of everything that’s
happening (i.e., the complete state of both ﬁelds and any charges and currents) in a horizontal
“slice” through the backwards light cone of (⃗x, t). The “slice” –  – is shown here as a shaded
circle, although of course this really represents a three-dimensional spherical region of radius cT

Pre-Quantum Theories
that looks like the shaded circle in the Figure – is an artifact of the suppression of the
third spatial dimension in these space-time diagrams. In fact, the shaded region in
question represents a sphere of radius cT (where T is the time interval between the
“slice” and the event in question at time t) centered at the event’s spatial location ⃗x.
Since, as we have argued in the previous section, causal inﬂuences in the theory
always propagate at c (or slower), it’s clear that all the causes of whatever happens at
(⃗x, t) must lie in this sphere. Nothing outside the sphere (at this earlier time) could
get to (⃗x, t) without propagating faster than light! But perhaps it is worth saying a
little more about this to clarify how this idea connects with our earlier discussion.
To begin with, it is straightforward to see that there will be a contribution (cor-
responding to the complementary solution part of our earlier general solution) to
ﬁelds at (⃗x, t) from the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the edge of . In the three-
dimensional picture, this corresponds to inward-propagating electromagnetic waves
that will arrive at position ⃗x at time t. And then there will also be the contribu-
tions (corresponding to the particular solution from above) from electric charges and
currents – the source terms – along the past light cone of (⃗x, t). So, for example,
in Fig.1.5, what particle 1 is doing at the point marked (a) will inﬂuence what is
happening at (⃗x, t).
One might worry that “what particle 1 is doing at ... (a)” is not part of C, our
complete speciﬁcation of events in . But what particle 1 is doing at (a) is determined
by C. Think about it this way: what particle 1 is doing at (a) depends on where
particle 1 was just prior to (a) and on the ﬁelds that inﬂuenced it at this earlier
moment; these ﬁelds in turn depend on ﬁelds on the intersection of  with the past
light cone of this earlier moment. See the thick black past-light-cone in the Figure.
And then we can continue to step our way back along the world line of particle 1
in this same way: what it was doing at the earlier moment depends on where it was
and what it was doing at an even-earlier moment, which in turn depends on the ﬁelds
on the intersection of  with the past light cone of this even-earlier moment. (See
the thin black past-light cone in the Figure.) And so on. You can then see how the
whole structure of the world-line of particle 1 is determined, ultimately, by the state
of particle 1 on  as well as the ﬁelds in a certain part of  that surrounds particle
1. And so, at the end of the day, all of the inﬂuences arriving at (⃗x, t) – both direct
ones and indirect ones – can indeed be traced back to physical facts about the states
of the particles and ﬁelds on . This is the sense in which any physical event χ(⃗x, t)
is determined by C in Maxwellian electrodynamics.
(Note, by the way, that particles like 2 in the ﬁgure, whose world lines cross
the past light cone of (⃗x, t) prior to  are no problem: the inﬂuence of particle
2 on happenings at (⃗x, t) coming from point (b) in the Figure are just “incoming
electromagnetic waves” that we have already captured by including the state of the
ﬁelds on the “edge” of .)
In sum, by specifying the complete state of both ﬁelds and charged particles on the
spacetime “slice” , we have complete information about everything that is relevant
to point (⃗x, t) and therefore any physical fact pertaining to point (⃗x, t) should be
determined. We will formalize this by writing

1.4 Bell’s Formulation of “Locality”
15
χ(⃗x, t) = f (C)
(1.26)
where, again, χ is our generic name for some physical fact (like the value of some
ﬁeld or the velocity of some charged particle) at (⃗x, t) and the right hand side means:
some function of a complete speciﬁcation of all the physical facts on .
Equation(1.26) seems like it captures the idea of “relativistic local causality” for
any deterministic theory. But remember, our goal here is to be completely generic.
And as you probably already know, it has often been suggested that one of the lessons
of quantum theory will turn out be that strict determinism must be abandoned. Bell
proposed that we could modify the deﬁnition of locality, as follows, and arrive at
something that still captures the idea of “relativistic local causality” but which is now
applicable to both deterministic and indeterministic theories:
P [χ1|C] = P [χ1|C, χ2] .
(1.27)
This requires a bit of explanation. First of all, the left hand side means: the probability
for some physical event χ1 to occur at point 1, given a complete speciﬁcation C of
events on  (the “slice” through the past light cone). This is the same idea as before,
but we just now speak of the probability of a certain event, rather than the event
itself, since we don’t want to presuppose that everything that happens is uniquely
determined by events in the past light cone. (Of course, determinism is still allowed
as a special case: in a deterministic theory, all of the probabilities will be either 1 or
0.) The right hand side is then meant to denote the probability assigned to the same
event, but now with both C and some other event, χ2 (which is at a point 2 which
could not have been causally inﬂuenced by events in ) speciﬁed. See Fig.1.6 for a
picture.
After proposing (what we have here written as) Eq.(1.27), Bell writes:
χ1

Fig. 1.6 According to Bell’s generic deﬁnition of relativistic local causality, the probability of an
event χ1 at point 1, conditioned on a complete speciﬁcation C of events in the region  (a “slice”
across the backwards light cone of 1), should not be changed by specifying, in addition, some fact
like χ2 which cannot have been locally inﬂuenced by anything in 

16

Pre-Quantum Theories
It is important that [] completely shields off from 1 the overlap of the backward light cones
of 1 and 2. And it is important that events in [] be speciﬁed completely. Otherwise the
traces in region 2 of causes of events in 1 could well supplement whatever else was being
used for calculating probabilities about 1. The hypothesis is that any such information about
2 becomes redundant when [the state of things in ] is speciﬁed completely [6].
The importance of specifying events in  completely is pretty straightforward. If
something is left out, then causal inﬂuences coming from the more distant past
– inﬂuences which produce correlations between χ1 and χ2 – could result in χ2
implying useful supplementary information (beyond that contained in the incomplete
description of events in ).
But why is it so important that  should “shield” from 1 the overlapping past
light cones of 1 and 2? In other words, why is it so important that the “other” event
in Bell’s formulation – χ2 – be so far away that it could not have been causally
inﬂuenced by events in ? See Fig.1.7 and its caption for an explanation.
I hope that gives you a sense of why Eq.(1.27) seems to provide a good way of
deﬁning “relativistic local causality” in a completely general, a completely generic,
way. It should come as no surprise that we will have occasion to use this formulation
in later chapters.
Actually, a slight modiﬁcation of Bell’s formulation will also come in handy.
To motivate this, one should understand that Bell’s deﬁnition of locality basically
amounts to the assertion that, once you provide a complete speciﬁcation of events
in a slice across its past-light-cone, the probability assigned to some physical event
1
B
A
X
Σ
Fig. 1.7 In a non-deterministic theory, an event A may happen, despite not being determined to
happen even by a complete speciﬁcation of events in , and then causally inﬂuence events at point 1.
So specifying, in addition to C, events like A that are in the past light cone of 1 but to the future of
, may indeed allow us to improve our predictions for events at 1. It might appear that, by contrast,
events like B – which could be inﬂuenced by despite not being determined by C but which are
outside the past light cone of 1 and hence could not locally inﬂuence events at point 1 – would
not allow us to improve our predictions for events at 1. But this is incorrect: in an indeterministic
theory, there might be an event X which is inﬂuenced (but not determined) by events in , which
then inﬂuences both B and happenings at 1. Speciﬁcation of B can thus imply things about X which
can in turn imply things about 1 that weren’t already implied just on the basis of C. This is why,
in Bell’s formulation of local causality, it is crucial that the other event (speciﬁcation of which is
not supposed to change the probability assigned to events at 1) should be outside the future light
cone of , i.e., this is why “[i]t is important that [] completely shields off from 1 the overlap of
the backward light cones of 1 and 2” [6]

1.4 Bell’s Formulation of “Locality”
17
should be independent of things happening outside the future-light-cone of that slice.
Bell’s formulation captures this independence by saying that the probability assigned
to the event in question should not change depending on whether you do, or don’t,
specify such things.
But another way to capture this independence is by requiring that the probability
be the same for any two different things that might be happening at this distant point:
P [χ1|C, χ2] = P

χ1|C, χ′
2

(1.28)
where χ2 and χ′
2 are two different possible versions of events at point 2 (in Fig.1.6).
Let us illustrate all this with an example. It is not so interesting to take an example
from Maxwellian electrodynamics, since that theory is manifestly local and hence
respects both of our locality conditions: Bell’s Equation(1.27) and our modiﬁcation,
Eq.(1.28). (You can try your hand at exploring this in the Projects if you are inter-
ested.) More interesting is seeing how our conditions can be used to diagnose the
non-local character of Newtonian gravity. So let’s take the following setup. There is
one particle, of mass M, ﬂoating freely in empty space. There are two other parti-
cles, both of mass m, being held in place nearby (by some external non-gravitational
forces) – one a certain distance to the left and the other the same distance to the right
of our mass-M particle of interest. The symmetry implies that, if both of the mass
m particles remain at rest, the net force on M will be zero and it will remain at rest.
Whereas, if one of the mass-m particles is moved at the last second, the forces on M
will no longer balance, and M will accelerate. See Fig.1.8.
Thus, the probability for M to have an acceleration of zero at point 1 is different,
depending on whether the mass-m particle on the right is moved, or not: Newtonian
gravity explicitly violates Eq.(1.28). This is of course no surprise, but is a nice
conﬁrmation that Eq.(1.28) can be used to diagnose non-locality when it is present.
What about Eq.(1.27)? The problem is that, in a non-local theory, the left hand
side, P [χ1|C], is simply not deﬁned! Since the theory says the acceleration of the
mass M particle depends on the locations of other distant particles at the moment in
question, if we don’t specify where the other distant particles are, there is no way
for the theory to tell us what will (or might) happen to the particle in question. So
although we expect that a genuinely local theory should respect both Eqs.(1.27)
and (1.28), it is difﬁcult to use Bell’s formulation, Eq.(1.27), to explicitly diagnose
the presence of non-locality in a theory. Our alternative formulation, Eq.(1.28), is
nicer in this respect. It allows us to explicitly identify non-locality by seeing that the
numbers on the two sides of the equation are different (rather than needing to try
to compare something which isn’t mathematically well-deﬁned at all, to something
that is). But whichever formulation we use, the non-locality of Newtonian gravity
should be clear: the force on a particle (and hence its acceleration) depends on the
location of distant particles at the exact moment in question.

Fig. 1.8 A particle of mass M sits at rest between two particles of mass m that begin at equal
distances from it in opposite directions. Let 1 be a space-time point through which the worldline of
the mass-M particle will pass if everything remains as described. The complete speciﬁcation, C,
of events on a slice, , across the past-light-cone of 1, is rather simple: the particle is at rest at a
certain point, and nothing else is going on! Take χ1 to be the statement that the mass-M particle
has an acceleration of zero at point 1. Suppose the mass-m particle on the left remains permanently
ﬁxed, but the mass-m particle on the right can either be left in place (call that χ2), or pushed to the
left (χ′
2). Then we have that P [χ1|C, χ2] = 1. That is, if the mass-m particle on the right remains
ﬁxed, the acceleration of the mass-M particle at point 1 will be zero with certainty. However, if
the particle on the right is pushed to the left, the two gravitational forces on M will no longer add
to zero, and M’s acceleration at 1 will deﬁnitely not be zero: P

1.5
Ontology
“Ontology” is a fancy philosopher’s word for “what really exists.” In general, for the
pre-quantum sorts of theories we’ve been looking at, “what really exists” according
to the theory is fairly obvious and non-controversial. For example, according to
Newtonian mechanics, the world is made of particles which move under the inﬂuence
of (gravitational and probably other) forces they exert on one another. The picture
is similar according to Maxwellian electrodynamics: the world is made of particles
which interact with one another by means of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The
ontology of Maxwellian electrodynamics, that is, includes particles and ﬁelds.
But there are often mathematically equivalent ways to formulate the basic laws
of a theory, and this can sometimes raise questions about which formulation we
should take seriously, as telling us in some relatively direct sense what really exists,
physically, according to the theory.
For example, as you probably know, it is possible in electrodynamics to work with
the so-called potentials (the scalar or electrostatic potential, and then the perhaps-
less-familiar magnetic vector potential) instead of the ﬁelds. Let us brieﬂy review
some of this.
One of Maxwell’s equations – the so-called “Gauss’ Law for Magnetism” – reads
⃗∇· ⃗B = 0. Since the divergence of any curl is identically zero, we can ensure that
this equation is automatically satisﬁed if we introduce a magnetic vector potential ⃗A
related to the magnetic ﬁeld by

1.5 Ontology
19
⃗B = ⃗∇× ⃗A.
(1.29)
This allows us to re-write Faraday’s Law as
⃗∇×

⃗E + ∂⃗A
∂t

= 0.
(1.30)
But then, because the curl of a gradient is identically zero, we can ensure that this
equation is automatically satisﬁed if we introduce a “scalar potential” φ satisfying
⃗E + ∂⃗A
∂t = −⃗∇φ.
(1.31)
(The minus sign is just for convention/convenience.) Equivalently, if we write the
electric ﬁeld in terms of the scalar and vector potentials as
⃗E = −⃗∇φ −∂⃗A
∂t
(1.32)
we guarantee the satisfaction of Faraday’s Law. That then leaves the other two (non-
homogeneous) Maxwell equations, which can now be re-written, in terms of φ and
⃗A as, respectively,
∇2φ + ∂
∂t ( ⃗∇· ⃗A) = −ρ
ϵ0
(1.33)
and
∇2 ⃗A −1
c2
∂2 ⃗A
∂t2 = −μ0 ⃗j + ⃗∇( ⃗∇· ⃗A + 1
c2
∂φ
∂t ).
(1.34)
These both look a little messy and complicated, but actually we have not yet taken
full advantage of the freedom afforded by the potentials. In particular, since all that
is really required of the potentials is that their various derivatives give the ﬁelds ⃗E
and ⃗B, there is an element of arbitrariness that we can leverage to make the equations
look nicer.
For example, it’s clear from the deﬁning relation ⃗B = ⃗∇× ⃗A that (since, again,
the curl of a gradient is identically zero!) we could change ⃗A by the gradient of an
arbitrary scalar function without affecting ⃗B. That is,
⃗A →⃗A + ⃗∇λ
(1.35)
leaves ⃗B unchanged.
“But” (I can hear you saying) “changing ⃗A in this way would affect the electric
ﬁeld!” That’s true, but we can “undo” that change by also requiring that, when ⃗A is
shifted as in Eq.(1.35), we also shift the scalar potential φ as follows:

20
1
Pre-Quantum Theories
φ →φ −∂λ
∂t .
(1.36)
It is easy to see that, if both φ and ⃗A are shifted in these ways, the ﬁelds ⃗B and ⃗E are
unaffected. These “shifts” in the potentials are called “gauge transformations” and
the idea is that there is a whole equivalence class of potentials (corresponding to all
possible scalar functions λ) that correspond to the same ﬁeld conﬁgurations.
This means that we are free to choose a particular set of potentials that makes
some of the terms in Eqs.(1.33) and (1.34) disappear. We will brieﬂy discuss two of
these possible choices.
The ﬁrst choice is to choose potentials satisfying the so-called “Lorentz gauge”
condition:
⃗∇· ⃗A + 1
c2
∂φ
∂t = 0.
(1.37)
With this choice, the wave equations satsiﬁed by φ and ⃗A take on the following
particularly simple forms:
∇2φ −1
c2
∂2φ
∂t2 = −ρ
ϵ0
(1.38)
and
∇2 ⃗A −1
c2
∂2 ⃗A
∂t2 = −μ0 ⃗j.
(1.39)
These are nice because they are precisely of the general form, Eq.(1.22), that we
investigated earlier. It’s clear, that is, that in Lorentz gauge, the effects of charges on
the potentials propagate outward at the speed of light.
But here is another perfectly valid choice of gauges, the so-called “Coulomb
gauge” in which
⃗∇· ⃗A = 0.
(1.40)
This turns out to imply the following dynamical equations (with source terms) for φ
and ⃗A:
∇2 ⃗A −1
c2
∂2 ⃗A
∂t2 = −μ0 ⃗j + 1
c2 ⃗∇∂φ
∂t
(1.41)
and
∇2φ = −ρ/ϵ0.
(1.42)
Look in particular at the latter equation. It is just like Eq.(1.38), but with the prop-
agation speed c set to inﬁnity so that the term involving the second derivative with
respect to time vanishes. So it implies that the scalar potential φ(⃗x, t) is determined
by the instantaneous conﬁguration of charges ρ(⃗x, t) – in just the same way that the
gravitational force on a given particle in Newtonian mechanics is determined by the
instantaneous conﬁguration of other particles. So the object φ – in Coulomb gauge

1.5 Ontology
21
– is nonlocal! It changes instantaneously, without any speed-of-light delay, if some
distant charge is wiggled.5
Butsowhat?Weshouldonlybebothered bythiskindofnonlocality,fromthepoint
of view of consistency with relativity, if we take φ as corresponding to something
that is physically real. So does it? The usual answer is: no! The potentials φ and
⃗A are mere calculation devices – it is instead the ﬁelds ⃗E and ⃗B which we should
take as directly corresponding to “physical stuff that really exists” according to the
theory. To put this in terms of our notation from the previous section, it would be
appropriate to let χ stand for (say) the value of ⃗E or ⃗B at some point, but it would
not be appropriate to let χ represent the value of φ or ⃗A at some point. In order
to function as intended, it is important that the χs in Bell’s formulation of locality
represent quantities that are endorsed, by the theory in question, as physically real.
Bell gives a memorable analogy here:
The situation is further complicated by the fact that there are things which do go faster than
light. British sovereignty is the classical example. When the Queen dies in London (long may
it be delayed) the Prince of Wales, lecturing on modern architecture in Australia, becomes
instantaneously King. (Greenwich Mean Time rules here.) And there are things like that in
physics. In Maxwell’s theory, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in free space satisfy the wave
equation

...corresponding to propagation with velocity c. But the scalar potential, if one chooses to
work in ‘Coulomb gauge’, satisﬁes Laplace’s equation

...corresponding to propagation with inﬁnite velocity. Because the potentials are only math-
ematical conveniences, and arbitrary to a high degree, made deﬁnite only by the imposition
of one convention or another, this inﬁnitely fast propagation of the Coulomb-gauge scalar
potential disturbs no one. Conventions can propagate as fast as may be convenient. But then
we must distinguish in our theory between what is convention and what is not [6].
This is a point that will occupy us considerably in the coming weeks. In quantum
theory, which objects in the formalism are we supposed to take seriously, as corre-
sponding to things that are physically real, and which are (like the scalar potential
and British sovereignty!) bound up in some way with human knowledge or conven-
tions? In particular, what is the ontological status of the quantum mechanical wave
function?
5For a nice analysis of how, in Coulomb gauge, the electric ﬁeld retains its local character even
though the scalar potential is nonlocal, see Ref. [7].

Measurement
The two example theories we’ve been discussing are obviously regarded as good
(if now slightly dated) scientiﬁc theories which have extremely favorable records of
correctly predicting measured or observed phenomena in nature. It will be helpful to
think a little bit about how, exactly, these theories achieve this status.
In the case of Newtonian mechanics, the situation is pretty straightforward. New-
tonian mechanics is a theory about the motion of Particles – and, consequently,
macroscopic assemblages of Particles which can in appropriate situations be treated
as particles. Certain such particles are directly visible to us, so we can just check –
by literally looking – to see if the particle is located where the theory says it will
be located. If so then we say that the theory’s prediction has been conﬁrmed by
observation.
For example, suppose you throw a ball up in the air from some initial height and
with some initial speed. If you know something about the (say, gravitational and air
drag) forces that will act on it, you can solve ⃗Fnet = m⃗a for the ball and calculate,
according to the theory, things like the maximum height the ball will reach and the
time it will spend in the air before hitting the ground. In the case of the maximum
height, the theory’s prediction can perhaps be compared against a literal, perceptual
observation: you just look and see how high the ball in fact goes before turning
around and heading back down.
But this is, at best, pretty rough. A careful measurement of the ball’s maximum
height will require some additional sophistication. For example, you might set up
some meter sticks and adjust your viewing perspective so that you can read off the
maximum height to some precision by seeing exactly which mark on the meter stick
lines up with the top of the ball at the moment it reaches its maximum height. One
might for example also ﬁlm the motion of the ball, with the meter stick in the back-
ground; looking through the individual frames later, one could identify the speciﬁc
frame in which the ball reaches its maximum height and then make a more precise
determination of that height using the image of the meter stick in the background.
And of course more sophisticated techniques are also possible, but this indicates the
overall pattern.
A measurement of, for example, the ball’s time aloft will follow a similar pattern.
Direct, unaided visual inspection perhaps gives some rough indication of the duration
of the ball’s ﬂight, but a more precise measurement would involve additional care
and equipment. For example, one might arrange for the ball’s launch to trigger a
stopwatch, whose second hand at that moment begins a rapid, steady rotation which
is then triggered to halt when the ball strikes the ground. The ﬁnal location of the
second hand (which one may inspect at a convenient later time) then indicates the
time the ball spent in the air.
The maximum height and time aloft of a launched ball are both things that are,
in some sense, directly observable – we can “measure” them in a kind of rough
and qualitative way by literally just watching the process unfold in real time. And
then we have been discussing ways in which those rough perceptual observations

1.6 Measurement
23
can be improved upon by using more sophisticated measuring equipment. There
are, however, things that theories talk about which are not even in principle directly
observable. In such cases, “measuring” or “observing” the fact in question (to, say,
test a prediction of the theory) requires more sophisticated measuring equipment.
For example, suppose you want to test the Maxwellian electrodynamics prediction
for what the electric ﬁeld is between the two plates of a charged capacitor. You work
out, based on the amount of charge that’s present, etc., what the electric ﬁeld should
be according to the theory. How do you then measure this to see if the theory’s
prediction is correct? You certainly can’t “just look and see”.
But you can arrange for the electric ﬁeld to leave its mark on something that you
can just see. For example, you might stick a particle of mass m and electric charge
q, at rest, at the place where you want to know the electric ﬁeld. The particle will
experience an electric force q ⃗E and will hence accelerate. If we can measure the
particle’s acceleration ⃗a, we can then infer that the electric ﬁeld was given by
⃗E = m
q ⃗a.
(1.43)
Measuring the acceleration is, in turn, straightforward. For example, you could set
a ruler next to the particle and observe the change ⃗x in its position after a short
period of time t. Basic kinematics then tells us that
⃗a = 2⃗x
t2 .
(1.44)
So, by measuring the position of a particle at two different times (and knowing the
mass and charge of the particle) we are able to indirectly measure the electric ﬁeld.
This puts us in a position to step back and see the point of this discussion. On
the one hand, a theory that makes no testable predictions is in some sense clearly
worthless. If you can’t measure or observe anything that the theory says things
about, the theory is fundamentally cut off from the structure of empirically-grounded
knowledge and really has no meaningful content at all. But on the other hand, it is
not the case that everything a theory says must somehow be directly observable. It
is perfectly reasonable for theories to postulate the existence of “invisible” things
(like electric and magnetic ﬁelds, atoms, neutrinos, etc.). But then the theory should
provide a consistent account of the interactions of those postulated invisible things
with other things (perhaps made of the invisible things!) that are visible, so that
overall the theory connects with the given world of direct perceptual experience and
thereby makes testable predictions.
As a kind of paradigmatic concretization of this idea, we will often speak of mea-
surements having their outcomes registered in the position of a “pointer”. One should
think here of a sort of black-box measuring instrument, along the lines indicated in
Fig.1.9, whose internal mechanism provides a causal link between some physical
quantity that is being (perhaps indirectly) measured (e.g., the time aloft of a ball, or
the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at a certain point, or the energy of a neutrino, or ...)

Fig. 1.9 A schematic measuring device whose probe end (on the left) can be arranged to interact
with some (perhaps microscopic/invisible) system of interest. The outcome of the measurement is
then registered by the position y of the device’s pointer. This is a relatively accurate picture of how
some real measuring devices work, but also captures in essentialized terms an important point about
any kind of measurement: at the end of the day, the outcome is registered in the conﬁguration of
some directly-observable (macroscopic) object (e.g., the position of the hands of a stopwatch, the
distribution of ink on a printout, etc.)
and the position of a pointer or needle that swings back and forth against a calibrated
background to indicate the value in question.
This may seem like a very specialized kind of case, but actually it captures the
essential idea of measurements quite generally. For example, the position of a ball
(whosemaximumheightonewantstomeasure)isitsownpointer.Thesecondhandon
the stopwatch functions as the pointer for measuring the ball’s time aloft. The charged
particle (whose ﬁnal position allows one to determine its acceleration and hence the
ﬁeld that caused that acceleration) functions as the pointer for the measurement of the
electric ﬁeld that we discussed before. In general, any measurement must produce
some effect in the conﬁguration of some directly-observable macroscopic object,
from whose ﬁnal conﬁguration we “read off” the result of the measurement. That is,
any measurement must involve something that can be interpreted as a pointer.
From the point of view of assessing candidate theories, this discussion suggests
several criteria. On the one hand, we should not demand too much from our the-
ories. For example, we should not insist that everything postulated by a theory be
somehow directly observable or measureable. Direct perception gives us some infor-
mation about the structure of the world, but it does not give us everything; we should
thus expect that, as science develops, theories should increasingly need to postulate
invisible, microscopic objects, the empirical justiﬁcation for which lies in the role of
those postulated invisible objects in correctly accounting for the behavior of things
(pointers!) that are directly visible.6
6Another way we might demand too much of a theory would be to demand that it not only account
for the behavior of directly visible things like pointers, but that it somehow account for our conscious
experiences of such things. The truth is that nobody understands how consciousness emerges and
in particular how speciﬁc conscious experiences arise from the interactions among the external
objects one perceives, one’s perceptual apparatus (including eyes, brain, etc.), and the faculty of

1.6 Measurement
25
On the other hand, we should also not demand too little from our theories. There
are things – like the positions of “pointers” on lab equipment, whether or not a
bomb has exploded, and the vitality of a certain cat – which are directly available
in ordinary sense perception, and which any candidate account of the microscopic
world should, in principle, be able to account for. Theories might validly postulate
all kinds of crazy-sounding and counter-intuitive things, but at the end of the day, if a
theory predicts the wrong thing for where pointers should point (or somehow cannot
account for the existence of pointers that point at all) it cannot be correct.
1.7
Abstract Spaces
Let us raise one ﬁnal point about the pre-quantum theories we’ve been discussing. In
the case of both Newtonian mechanics and Maxwellian electrodynamics, everything
we have talked about so far can be understood in terms of ordinary three-dimensional
space (and/or four-dimensional space-time). The particles, for example, that are a
central part of the ontology for these theories, “live” in three-dimensional space. As
do the ﬁelds of Maxwellian electrodynamics. But it is worth pointing out that there
are various mathematical re-formulations of some of these ideas, in which various
sorts of “abstract spaces” are used.
For example, it is sometimes useful to use “phase space” to talk about the kine-
matics and dynamics of particles. For a single particle moving in three dimensional
physical space, the phase space is a six-dimensional space whose axes correspond to
the x, y, and z coordinates of the particle and also the three components of the par-
ticle’s momentum: px, py, pz. It is of course difﬁcult to visualize a six-dimensional
space, but if we consider a toy model system in which a particle is conﬁned to move
onlyalongasinglespatialdimension(say, x),thenthephasespaceistwo-dimensional
(axes x and px) and we can easily visualize it.
Take, as a simple example, the case of a particle that is just moving inertially:
px = constant, so then x = pxt/m + x0. We can plot the “trajectory” of the particle
through phase space; see Fig.1.10.
A slightly more interesting case is a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The
spatial coordinate x oscillates sinusoidally (say, about x = 0) and the momentum
px also oscillates sinusoidally but out of phase with the position: the momentum
is big (either positive or negative) when the position is zero, and vice versa. The
“trajectory” of the particle through phase space is shown in Fig.1.11. The “trajectory”
is a closed orbit – an elliptical curve. See if you can ﬁgure out which direction the
(Footnote 6 continued)
consciousness that somehow emerges from brain structure and function (if, indeed, it is separable
from these things at all). These are deep and difﬁcult questions that are largely outside the scope
of physics. As far as physics is concerned, if a theory accounts for the existence of macroscopic
material objects which possess gross, coarse-grained properties consistent with what we are given
in ordinary perception – i.e., if a theory gets the pointer positions right – we should regard it as
perfectly acceptable and empirically adequate.

x
px
Fig. 1.10 The “trajectory” of a free particle (moving with constant momentum) through phase
space: at t = 0 the particle begins, at a negative value of x, with a positive momentum which
stays constant as the particle moves. So its “path” through phase space looks like the solid line and
would continue indeﬁnitely to the right as long as the particle continues moving with unchanged
momentum

or decreasing?)
Another type of “abstract space” that is sometimes useful to think about in the
context of classical physics – and which we will confront again in the context of
quantum mechanics – is “conﬁguration space”. For a single particle, conﬁguration
space is just the same as physical space: it is all the places the particle could be.
But in a situation involving (say) two particles (moving, for simplicity, in one spatial
dimension), there is the set of all places (call them x1) where the ﬁrst particle might
be, and then also the set of all places (call them x2) where the second particle might
be. The conﬁguration space is then the set of all possible conﬁgurations of the two
particles jointly – that is, conﬁguration space is a (here) two-dimensional space whose
axes are x1 and x2.
Let’s again consider two examples, one really simple and one at least slightly more
interesting. Suppose, for example, that we have two particles moving in (the same)
one-dimensional space. Except, let’s say, they aren’t actually moving, but are instead
both just sitting there. In particular, particle 1 is sitting at a small positive value of x,
and particle 2 is sitting at a somewhat larger negative value of x. Figure1.12 shows
this situation, both in (regular) physical space, and then again in conﬁguration space.

Fig. 1.12 On the left are two particles (“particle 1” and “particle 2”) sitting at different points
along the x-axis. This same situation is represented in the abstract conﬁguration space as a single

Fig. 1.13 The same two particles as before, but now particle 2 (which starts on the left) is given a
kick at t = 0 so it moves to the right (its initial velocity is indicated by the dark gray arrow) until it
collides with particle 1. The post-collision velocities are indicated with the light gray arrows. This
same process is shown, on the right, in the abstract conﬁguration space. Note the dashed line at
x1 = x2 corresponding to the particles being at the same location, i.e., colliding
As a slightly more interesting example, suppose now that somebody comes in and
gives particle 2 a kick so that it starts moving to the right. Eventually it runs into
particle 1 and, let’s suppose, they collide elastically. Suppose particle 1 has a greater
mass than particle 2, so that after the collision particle 2 recoils back out to the left,
whereas particle 1 drifts off slowly to the right. This process is depicted – both in
physical space and in the abstract conﬁguration space – in Fig.1.13.
What is the point of discussing these abstract spaces? Well, as I said, they are
sometimes useful ways to depict a certain physical process to gain some intuition.
And there are even complete reformulations of Newtonian mechanics where things
are formulated in terms of one of these abstract spaces – for example, if you’ve taken a
course in classical mechanics, you have probably encountered “Hamiltonian mechan-
ics” which is basically a way of re-writing ⃗Fnet = m⃗a in terms of energy quantities.
The basic dynamical equations in this Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics are
ﬁrst-order (in time) differential equations for the coordinates of a system in phase
space. There is also something called the “Hamilton-Jacobi” formulation of mechan-
ics which involves something like a time-dependent “ﬁeld” on conﬁguration space,

28

Pre-Quantum Theories
which inﬂuences or guides the actual conﬁguration point (representing the positions
of all the particles composing the system) through that space. We won’t go into these
things in any detail here, but it is good to be aware that they exist.
At this stage, the main take-home lesson from this discussion is this: don’t confuse
any of these abstract spaces with regular old physical space! For example, if you are
studying a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, and sketch its phase space trajectory
as in Fig.1.11, you should not ask: “What force provides the centripetal acceleration
which holds the particle in this elliptical orbit?” Or similarly, you should not ask,
about the particle collision process depicted in Fig.1.13, “That dotted line in the
picture that the particle bounced off of... what’s it made of ??” Those sorts of questions
don’t actually make any sense, and would seem to be based on simply forgetting
that the space in question is an abstract one. If, in these kinds of situations, you
want to know what is really going on, physically, you need to translate the abstract
representation back into direct, literal, physical-space terms. For example, the dotted
line in the previous Figure is not really a “thing” at all, but instead a kind of abstract
representation of the strong repulsive forces that the two particles exert on each other
if they get too close together in physical space. And the only force present in the case
of the simple harmonic oscillator is the force exerted on the particle by a spring (or
whatever) as it moves back and forth along a line – there is nothing like an elliptical
orbit at all, if that means some literal material particle moving along a certain curved
path through a two-dimensional physical space.
This of course all seems so clear and obvious as to be almost embarrassing to
have to say. But as you’ll see (especially in Chap.5) confusion will arise around
these kinds of issues when we get to quantum mechanics – to which we will turn
very soon!
Projects:
(1.1) Show that a spherically-symmetric distribution of mass (e.g., a thin spherical
shell composed of innumerable massive Particles) exerts the same gravita-
tional force on an outside particle as the force that would be exerted by a
single Particle with the same total mass as the shell and located at the center
of the shell. Explain how this is an example of the theory explaining how and
why a large (spherically symmetric) assemblage of Particles can be treated
as a particle.
(1.2) Show that a rigid body (like a bunch of Particles glued together) will obey
Newton’s 2nd law ( ⃗F = m⃗a) if the individual particles do. Note that a
rigid body can rotate in addition to moving translationally, so you should
not assume that all the individual Particles have the same acceleration ⃗a.
Indeed, the main problem here is to ﬁgure out precisely how “the accelera-
tion of the rigid body” can be deﬁned to make something like Newton’s 2nd
law true. Hint: it might be helpful to consider the center of mass coordinate,
⃗R =

i mi⃗ri, and its various time-derivatives. Explain how this is an
example of the theory explaining how and why a large assemblage of Particles
can be treated as a particle.

(1.3) Consider two equal-mass stars in a binary star system, each making a circular
orbit about their mutual center-of-mass point. Now suppose that gravitational
forces are given by Eq.(1.1), but with ⃗r j being the position of the distant mass
at a slightly earlier time (such that a signal emitted by it at that earlier time
would just arrive at the mass in question now). Draw a careful diagram show-
ing the gravitational forces acting on each star at some particular moment.
Do the forces respect Newton’s third law? Will the total momentum of the
two-star system be conserved (assuming no forces act from the outside)? How
about the total angular momentum? Can you think of another similar situation
in which the total translational momentum would not be conserved? What do
you make of all this?
(1.4) Give a simple example of a system of masses interacting via Newtonian grav-
itational forces, and show that/how the motion of the masses would be differ-
ent if one used a different slicing of space-time into simultaneity slices. (That
is, show that Newtonian mechanics with instantaneous, action-at-a-distance
gravitational interactions is incompatible with relativity, since it requires a
dynamically privileged notion of simultaneity.)
(1.5) The mathematical parallel between Newton’s law of gravity and Coulomb’s
law of electrostatics suggests that a relativistic theory of gravity could be
developed by, in effect, copying Maxwell’s equations. Play around with this
and see how far you can get. (Hint: the gravitational analog of the electric
ﬁeld ⃗E is the gravitational ﬁeld ⃗g, which has units of acceleration. So the
gravitational analog of Gauss’ Law should be something like ⃗∇· ⃗g ∼ρm
where ρm is the mass density. What should the proportionality constant be in
order to reproduce Newtonian gravity? After you ﬁgure out the gravitational
analog to Gauss’ Law, you can try to work out consistent gravitational analogs
to the three other Maxwell equations as well!)
(1.6) Flesh out the equivalence between Coulomb’s law and Gauss’ law by explain-
ing in detail how to solve for ⃗E in Gauss’ law when ρ = q δ3(⃗x).
(1.7) Work through the details of deriving wave equations for ⃗E and ⃗B from
Maxwell’s equations. (Assume empty space, i.e., ρ = 0 and ⃗j = 0.) Show
that there are plane-wave solutions of the form ⃗E(⃗x, t) = ⃗E0 sin(⃗k · ⃗x −ωt),
and similarly for ⃗B. Are the waves transverse, or longitudinal? How do you
know? What is the relationship between |⃗k| and ω? What are the phase and
group velocities of the waves in terms of ϵ0 and μ0?
(1.8) Let’s try to understand better how Eq.(1.24) is a solution of the wave equation
with a delta-function source. For simplicity, suppose the source point is at
⃗x′ = 0 and t′ = 0 so that the differential equation in question reads
∇2ψ −1
c2
∂2ψ
∂t2 = δ3(⃗x)δ(t).
(1.45)
The solution ψ should be spherically symmetric, i.e., should be a function of
r and t only. (a) Show that, for r ̸= 0, any function of the general form

Pre-Quantum Theories
ψ(r, t) = g(t −r/c)

(1.46)
solves Eq.(1.45). (b) The correct function g should also satisfy Eq.(1.45)
at r = 0. To ensure this, integrate both sides of Eq.(1.45) over a spherical
volume of radius R centered at r = 0. Show that taking the R →0 limit then
gives −4πg(t) = δ(t), i.e.,
ψ(r, t) = −1

as claimed in the text.
(1.9) When he is presenting his formulation of locality, Bell gives an analogy to
the boiling of an egg. You put the egg into the boiling water and set the timer
for (say) 5min. Then, 5min later, “[t]he ringing of the alarm establishes the
readiness of the egg.” That is, the two events are correlated. However, the
ringingofthealarmdoesnotaffect theegg.Bellexplains:“ifitisalreadygiven
that the egg was nearly boiled a second before, then the ringing of the alarm
makes the readiness no more certain.” Draw a spacetime diagram; connect
“the ringing of the alarm”, “the readiness of the egg”, and its being “already
given that the egg was nearly boiled a second before” with the terminology
χ1, χ2, and C; and explain how the last sentence captures the locally causal
character of the physical processes involved in this example.
(1.10) An unstable particle is heading for a particle detector which will “click”
if the particle hits it. Given the state of the particle at some earlier time,
suppose there is a 50% probability of its not decaying ﬁrst and hence hitting
the detector: P [click|C] = 1/2. On the other hand, if the particle does
decay before arriving at the detector, the decay products might themselves be
detected and hence indicate that the original particle will not be detected by
the original detector. So, for example, P [click|C, χ2] = 0, where χ2 denotes
the successful detection of one of the decay products. See Fig.1.14. Does the
non-equality of the two conditional probabilities here imply a violation of
Bell’s locality condition? (One would hope not, since there is clearly nothing
nonlocal happening here. On the other hand, this seems to be a case where
information from outside the past light cone of the event in question, does
affect the probabilities assigned to that event.) Explain.
(1.11) Make up an example, maybe along the lines of the example involving New-
tonian gravity from the main text, to show that Maxwellian electrodynamics
gets (correctly) diagnosed as “local” both by Bell’s formulation and the mod-
iﬁed formulation.
(1.12) Is there a way of choosing a gauge such that the vector potential ⃗A propagates
with inﬁnite speed, the way φ does in the Coulomb gauge? Explain.
(1.13) A standard introductory physics problem involves analyzing the “ballistic
pendulum” in which a block of mass M hanging from a string of length L
absorbs an incoming bullet of mass m moving at some unknown initial speed

v0. The bullet-and-block then swing up together, with the string eventually
making some maximum angle θ with respect to the vertical. By observing
θ one can thereby determine the initial speed of the bullet. Work out this
relationship (i.e., solve for v0 as a function of θ, m, M, and L) and explain
how this method of measuring the bullet’s speed ﬁts into the general scheme
introduced in the text in which the outcome is registered in some directly
observable “pointer”.
(1.14) Pick a measuring apparatus of interest to you (maybe something that you’ve
used in a physics lab course or research, maybe the accelerometer in your
iPhone, or just something else you’re interested in) and learn more about how
it actually works. Explain whether (and, assuming so, how) the actual device
ﬁts into the general scheme introduced in the text in which the outcome is
registered in some directly observable “pointer”.
(1.15) Two equal-mass gliders are ﬂoating on a (nearly) frictionless air track in an
introductory physics classroom. The track is equipped with elastic bumpers
on both ends, and the two gliders have elastic-collision attachments so they
will bounce when they collide. One glider is initially at rest, while the other
is given an initial velocity. Draw a space-time diagram showing world lines
for both gliders as well as the two bumpers on the ends of the track. Now
draw the “trajectory” of the two-glider system through the two-dimensional
conﬁguration space.

Chapter 2
Quantum Examples
In this chapter we review quantum theory (at the level of wave mechanics) and
develop a toolbox of simple quantum mechanical examples that we will use, in the
following chapters, to discuss a number of the issues raised in Chap.1: locality,
ontology, measurement, etc.
2.1
Overview
We begin with the (time-dependent) Schrödinger Equation,
iℏ∂
∂t = ˆH.
(2.1)
For a single particle of mass m moving in one dimension, the Hamiltonian operator
ˆH is
ˆH = −ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂x2 + V (x)
(2.2)
so that the time-dependent Schrödinger Equation reads:
iℏ∂(x, t)
∂t
= −ℏ2
2m
∂2(x, t)
∂x2
+ V (x, t)(x, t).
(2.3)
We typically use this equation in the following sort of way: given some initial wave
function (x, 0) (which we think of as having been created by a special preparation
of the particle in question), we then solve Schrödinger’s Equation to ﬁnd the wave
function at some later time t when some kind of observation or measurement of the
particle occurs. A second basic postulate of the theory – the “Born rule” – is then
introduced to tell us what (x, t) implies about how the measurement will come

out. In its simplest form, corresponding to a measurement of the position x of the
particle, the Born rule says that the probability of observing the particle at the point
x is equal to the square of the wave function’s modulus:
P(x) = |(x, t)|2 .
(2.4)
(Well, technically, this P(x) is a probability density, i.e., a probability-per-unit-length
along the x axis. The precise statement is that the probability of ﬁnding the particle
in a range of size dx near the point x is P(x)dx = ||2dx. Note also that we assume
here that the wave function is properly normalized, i.e.,
 ∞
−∞||2dx = 1.)
If some property of the particle other than its position is measured (for example,
its momentum or energy) then we will use the “generalized Born rule”. This says
that we should write (x, t) as a linear combination of eigenstates of the operator
corresponding to the property in question. That is, we should write
(x, t) =

i
cii(x, t)
(2.5)
(or perhaps instead an integral if the property in question has a continuous spectrum)
where i is an eigenstate of the operator ˆA with eigenvalue Ai:
ˆAi(x, t) = Aii(x, t).
(2.6)
Then the probability that the measurement of A yields the value Ai is
P(Ai) = |ci|2.
(2.7)
As a simple example, suppose we measure the momentum of a particle at time t. The
momentum operator is
ˆp = −iℏ∂
∂x
(2.8)
whose eigenstates are the plane waves
ψp(x) = eipx/ℏ.
(2.9)
(Note that there’s a bit of funny business about normalization here, but let’s ignore
that for now.) Suppose our wave function at time t is (x, t) =
√
2 sin(kx). We can
write this as a linear combination of the momentum eigenstates as follows:
(x, t) =
√
2 sin(kx) =
1
√
2i
ei(ℏk)x/ℏ−
1
√
2i
ei(−ℏk)x/ℏ.
(2.10)
This is a linear combination of two momentum eigenstates, with eigenvalues p =
+ℏk and p = −ℏk, and expansion coefﬁcients c+ℏk = 1/
√
2i and c−ℏk = −1/
√
2i

2.1 Overview
35
respectively. So evidently the probability that the momentum measurement has the
outcome “p = +ℏk” is P(+ℏk) = |1/
√
2i|2 = 1/2, and the probability that the
momentum measurement has the outcome “p = −ℏk” is P(−ℏk) = | −1/
√
2i|2
which is also 1/2.
Note that the original Born rule (for position measurements) can be understood as
a special case of the “generalized Born rule” if we take ˆA to be the position operator
ˆx with delta functions as eigenstates:
ˆxδ(x −x′) = x′δ(x −x′).
(2.11)
We can then write any arbitrary state (x, t) as a linear combination of position
eigenstates as follows:
(x, t) =

(x′, t)δ(x −x′) dx′
(2.12)
where the (x′, t) should be understood as the expansion coefﬁcient, like ci. Thus,
according to the generalized Born rule, the probability for a position measurement
to yield the value x′ should be the square of the expansion coefﬁcient, i.e.,
Pt(x′) = |(x′, t)|2
(2.13)
just like in the original statement of the Born rule.
But enough about measurement. For now I just want to make sure you had heard
of this so that you understand, in some practical terms, what solving the Schrödinger
equation is for. There are a few Projects at the end of the chapter that will help you
practice using Born’s rule and then we will return to discuss all of this more critically
in Chap.3.
For now, we return to Schrödinger’s equation. Given an initial wave function
(x, 0), how does one actually solve it? Our standard technique will take advantage
of the fact that there exist “separable” solutions of the form
n(x, t) = ψn(x) fn(t).
(2.14)
If we plug this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation we ﬁnd that the function ψn(x)
should satisfy the “time-independent Schrödinger equation” (TISE),
−ℏ2
2m
∂2ψn(x)
∂x2
+ V (x)ψn(x) = Enψn(x)
(2.15)
where En is just a constant that we can think of as the energy of the solution in
question. The function fn(t) in turn satisﬁes
iℏd fn(t)
dt
= En fn(t)
(2.16)

36

Quantum Examples
which we can solve once and for all right now:
fn(t) = e−i Ent/ℏ.
(2.17)
Now we can explain our basic strategy. For a given potential energy function
V (x), we solve the TISE to ﬁnd the “energy eigenstates” ψn(x) and corresponding
energy eigenvalues En. If we can ﬁnd a way to write the given initial wave function
as a linear combination of these “energy eigenstates”, as in
(x, 0) =

n
cnψn(x)
(2.18)
then we can construct a solution of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation
by simply tacking the appropriate time-dependent fn(t) factor onto each term in the
sum. That is:
(x, t) =

n
cnψn(x)e−i Ent/ℏ.
(2.19)
This is the basic technique we’ll now illustrate with a couple of examples.

But since the potential V goes to inﬁnity abruptly at x = 0 and x = L, the only way
the TISE will be solved for all x (including x = 0 and x = L) is if ψ(x) = 0 at
x = 0 and x = L. Requiring ψ = 0 at x = 0 means that we cannot have any of the
cosine term, i.e., B = 0. And then requiring ψ = 0 at x = L puts a constraint on
the wave number k: an integer number of half-wavelengths must ﬁt perfectly in the
box, i.e., k = kn where
kn = nπ
L
(2.23)
with n = 1, 2, 3, .... Good. So the “energy eigenfunctions” for the particle-in-a-box
potential take the form
ψn(x) =

.
(2.24)
Notethatthefactoroutfrontcomesfromrequiringnormalization:
 L

We can ﬁnd the corresponding energy eigenvalues by plugging ψn into Eq.(2.15).
The result is
En = ℏ2π2n2
2mL2 .
(2.25)
The general solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation can thus be written
(x, t) =

n=1
cnψn(x)e−i Ent/ℏ.

Let’s illustrate with a simple example. Suppose the wave function of a particle in
a box is given, at t = 0, by
(x, 0) =
1
√
2
ψ1(x) + 1
√
2
ψ2(x).
(2.27)
This function is plotted in Fig.2.2. Notice that there is constructive interference
between ψ1 and ψ2 on the left hand side of the box, giving rise to a  with a large
modulus there, but (partial) destructive interference on the right. So at t = 0 the

the two lowest energy eigenstates (shown individually as dashed curves)
particle is much more likely to be found (if looked for!) on the left hand side of the
box.
How, then, does  evolve in time? Here we don’t have to do any work to write the
initial wave function as a linear combination of energy eigenstates. Equation(2.27)
already gave it to us in that form! So then it is trivial to write down an equation for
the wave function at time t:
(x, t) =

(2.29)
Notice that each term has an e−i Ent/ℏfactor, but that the frequencies (ωn = En/ℏ)
are different for the two terms. In particular, the frequency of the n = 2 term is four
times as big as the frequency of the n = 1 term. And so, for example, in a time
t = T1/2 = π/ω1 = ℏπ/E1 = 2mL2/ℏπ equal to half the period of the n = 1
factor (so that the n = 1 factor is −1), the n = 2 factor will have gone through two
complete oscillations and will therefore be back to its original value of unity. At this
time, the overall wave function will therefore look like the one shown in Fig.2.3:
there will now be constructive interference (and hence a high probability of ﬁnding
the particle) on the right.
Thus, already in this simple example, we see an interesting non-trivial dynamics:
the (probability of ﬁnding the) particle in some sense “sloshes back and forth” in the
box.
2.3
Free Particle Gaussian Wave Packets
Let us now turn our attention to a second simple example – the “free particle”. This is
the same as the particle-in-a-box, but with the edges of the box (which in the previous
section were at x = 0 and L) pushed back to ±∞. So in principle we could jump in

Fig. 2.3 The wave function for the same situation but after a time equal to half the period of the
n = 1 state. The frequency of the n = 2 state is four times higher, so in the same amount of time that
makes e−i E1t/ℏ= −1, we have that e−i E2t/ℏ= +1. So the n = 2 term in the superposition looks
the same as it did at t = 0, but the n = 1 term is now “upside down”. This produces destructive
interference on the left and constructive interference on the right
by saying that the general solution to the TISE is just Eq.(2.22) again:
ψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx)
(2.30)
but where now there is no reason that B needs to be zero, and no constraint at all on
the wave number k.
This would be ﬁne, actually, but it turns out to be a little nicer to instead use the
so-called plane-wave states
ψk(x) =
1
√
2π
eikx
(2.31)
which are also perfectly good solutions of the free-particle TISE and which, as
mentioned earlier, can be understood as eigenstates of the momentum operator ˆp =
−iℏ∂/∂x with eigenvalue pk = ℏk. They are also of course energy eigenstates with
Ek = p2
k
2m = ℏ2k2
2m .
(2.32)
(Note that – like the “position eigenstates” we mentioned earlier in the chapter –
these momentum eigenstates are not properly normalized, and indeed not technically
normalizable at all! As long as we include the pre-factor of
1
√
2π in our deﬁnition of
the ψk states, however, their normalization is in a certain sense consistent with the
normalization of the δ-function position eigenstates, and we won’t run into trouble.)
Let’s again focus on a concrete example: suppose that the wave function of a free
particle is initially given by the Gaussian function
(x, 0) = Ne−x2/4σ2
(2.33)
where N is a normalization constant. What, exactly, N is is not that important, but it
will be a useful exercise to calculate it here. The idea is to choose N so that

e−x2/2σ2 dx.
(2.34)
There is a cute trick to evaluate Gaussian integrals like that appearing here on the
right hand side. Let’s deﬁne the “standard Gaussian integral” as
J =
 ∞
−∞
e−Ax2 dx.
(2.35)
Then we can write J 2 as a double integral like this:
J 2 =

e−Ax2 dx

−∞
e−Ax2e−Ay2 dx dy.
(2.36)
One can think of this as integrating a two-dimensional Gaussian function over the
entire x −y−plane. But we can rewrite this integral using polar coordinates (r2 =
x2 + y2) as follows:
J 2 =
 ∞
0
e−Ar22πr dr.
(2.37)
But then this integral can be done (using a substitution, u = Ar2, so 2πr dr =
π du/A) to give
J 2 = π
A
(2.38)
so that
J =
 π
A.
(2.39)
Using this general result to simplify the right hand side of Eq.(2.34) gives
1 = |N|2

e−x2/2σ2 dx = |N|2σ

(2.40)
so
|N| =

.
(2.41)
We might as well choose N to be real and positive, so now we know how to write a
properly-normalized Gaussian initial wave function:

(x, 0) =

σ
√
2π
e−x2/4σ2.
(2.42)
But of course the real question is: how does this state evolve in time?
To ﬁnd out, we need to follow the general procedure: write the initial state (x, 0)
as a linear combination of the energy eigenstates, then just tack on the appropriate
e−i Et/ℏfactor to each term in the linear combination.
OK, so, ﬁrst step: write the initial state as a linear combination of the energy
eigenstates. Here there is a continuous inﬁnity of energy eigenstates (parameterized
by the wave number k) so the linear combination will involve an integral rather than
a sum. It should look like this:
(x, 0) =
 ∞
−∞
φ(k) eikx
√
2π
dk.
(2.43)
The (continuously inﬁnite collection of!) numbers φ(k) are the “expansion coefﬁ-
cients”. How do we ﬁnd them? One way is to recognize that the last equation says:
φ(k) is just the Fourier transform of (x, 0). So if that’s a familiar thing, there you
go! If not, though, here’s how to extract them. This procedure is sometimes called
“Fourier’s trick”. The idea is to use the fact that the different energy eigenstates (here,
the plane waves) are orthogonal in the following sense: if you multiply one of them
(k) by the complex conjugate of a different one (k′) the result is oscillatory and its
integral is zero – unless k = k′ in which case the product is just 1 and you get a giant
inﬁnity. Formally:
 	 eikx
√
2π

 
eik′x
√
2π
∗
dx = δ(k −k′).
(2.44)
We can use this property to isolate the expansion coefﬁcients φ(k) in Eq.(2.43). Just
multiply both sides by e−ik′x/
√
2π and then integrate both sides with respect to x.
The result of the x-integral on the right is a delta function that we can use to do the
k-integral. When the dust settles, the result is
φ(k′) =
 
e−ik′x
√
2π

(x, 0) dx.
(2.45)
So far we have avoided plugging in our Gaussian state for the initial wave function
so this result is completely general. But let’s now plug in Eq.(2.42) and proceed as
follows:

(2.46)
which is just another “standard Gaussian integral”. Using our general formula to
perform it, we arrive at:
φ(k) =
√
2Nσ e−k2σ2.
(2.47)
Qualitatively, the important thing here is that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian
(in x) is another Gaussian (in k). And notice in particular that the “width” of φ(k) is
(something like) 1/σ – the inverse of the width of the original Gaussian in position
space. This illustrates an important qualitative principle of Fourier analysis, that
to make a sharply peaked function in position space requires superposing plane-
waves with a very broad range of wave numbers, whereas you only need a narrower
range of wave numbers to construct a more spread out function in position space. In
the context of quantum mechanics this idea is intimately related to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle: the width of a wave packet in position space is essentially “the
uncertainty in its position”, x, whereas the “width” in k-space is (since p = ℏk)
“the uncertainty in its momentum” divided by ℏ. These being inverses of each other
therefore means that the position uncertainty and the momentum uncertainty are
inversely related: x ∼ℏ/p.
See the end-of-chapter Projects for some further (and more careful) exploration
of this connection.
Let’s step back and remember why we’re doing all this math. We want to start with
aniceGaussianwavepacketandseehowitevolvesintimeaccordingtoSchrödinger’s
equation. To do that, we needed to ﬁrst ﬁgure out how to write the initial Gaussian
packet as a superposition of the energy eigenstates – here, the plane-wave states.
That’s what we’ve just accomplished! That is, we ﬁgured out that we can write
(x, 0) =

φ(k) eikx
√
2π
dk

φ(k) =

(2.49)
Now the whole reason we wanted to write (x, 0) in this special form, is that doing
so makes it easy to write down an equation for the state at a later time t: we just tack
the e−i Et/ℏfactor on each term. So let’s do that! The result is:

Now, with the same sort of massaging we did before (“completing the square” in the
argument of the exponential, etc.) we can do this integral. I’ll leave that as a Project

Phew!
This function is Gaussian-ish... You could think of it as a Gaussian with a time-
dependent, complex width (whatever that means!). But if you multiply it by its
complex conjugate, to get the probability density for ﬁnding the particle, that is
deﬁnitely Gaussian:

Notice in particular that the width of this Gaussian (i.e., the uncertainty in the position
of the particle) grows with time:
x(t) = σ

1 +
ℏ2t2
4m2σ4 .
(2.53)
See Fig.2.4 for an illustration. Initially (for times small compared to 2mσ2/ℏ) the
width grows slowly, but then later (for times long compared to 2mσ2/ℏthe width
grows linearly in time. So the uncertainty in the position of the particle grows and
grows as time evolves. Interestingly, the uncertainty in the momentum never changes:
the ﬁrst line of Eq.(2.50) can be understood as saying that the complex phases of
the momentum “expansion coefﬁcients” change with time, but their magnitudes stay
the same. So the probability distribution for momentum values, and hence p, is
independent of time. This makes sense, if you think about it, since we’re talking about
a free particle, i.e., a particle on which no forces act. Anyway, this nicely illustrates
the fact that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle takes the form of an inequality: the
product of x and p can be arbitrarily large, but there’s a smallest possible value.
2.4
Diffraction and Interference
The spreading of an initial wave packet is closely related to the phenomenon of
diffraction. Imagine, for example, a particle that is incident on a barrier with a slit:
the barrier simply blocks/absorbs the part of the particle’s wave function that hits it, so
that just downstream of the barrier and along the direction transverse to the direction
of propagation of the particle, the wave function has a packet-shaped proﬁle like the
ones we were discussing in the last section. And the evolution of the packet-shape
with position, downstream of the slit, is (approximately) the same as the evolution
of the one-dimensional packets (discussed in the previous section) with time. In
particular, as we saw in the last section, the wave packet will spread in this transverse
direction as it propagates downstream. This is the phenomenon, illustrated in Fig.2.5,
of diffraction.
Of course, for a literal slit (which absorbs everything that hits it, and transmits
whatever part of the incident wave goes through the slit) the transverse proﬁle of the
wave function (just downstream of the barrier) would be something like this:
(x, 0) =

N for −L
2 < x < L
2
0
otherwise
(2.54)
with the constant N evidently being 1/
√
L to ensure proper normalization. As it
turns out, the sharp edges (at x = −L/2 and x = L/2) of this function produce a
Fourier transform φ(k) that diverges at k = 0 and this makes it slightly tricky to work
with. See the Projects for a work-around that allows one to deal with this situation.

2.4 Diffraction and Interference
45
Fig. 2.5 An incident wave
passes through a slit and
diffracts
But just to understand the process conceptually, we can contemplate a “Gaussian
slit”, i.e., a barrier with a “transmission proﬁle” (i.e., fraction of incident wave func-
tion that transmits rather than being absorbed) equal to a Gaussian. Then – basically
by deﬁnition – the transverse proﬁle of the beam just downstream of the barrier is a
Gaussian, as in Eq.(2.42). If we make the approximation that the wave just steadily
propagates to the right at some speed v = ℏk
m then we can relate the coordinate y
along the direction of propagation to the time via y = vt. (This approximation is
explained and developed further in the Projects.) And so we can immediately use, for
example, Eq.(2.52) to write down an expression for the “intensity” (i.e., probability
density) for ﬁnding the particle in the two-dimensional region behind the barrier:
I (x, y) ∼|(x, y)|2 ∼

e
−x2/2

σ2+
ℏ2 y2
4m2v2σ4

.
(2.55)
I used Mathematica to make a nice density plot of this function; the result is shown
in Fig.2.6.
One of the nice reasons for setting this up, however, is that it provides a simple
way to examine the structure of the wave function behind a double slit barrier. The
classic two-slit interference pattern was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Thomas Young as crucial
evidence that light was a wave. And then of course the identiﬁcation that “particles”
(such as electrons) also exhibit interference, played and continues to play a crucial
role in our understanding of the quantum nature of the sub-atomic realm.
So, then, imagine a barrier with not one but two “Gaussian slits” centered, say, at
x = a and x = −a. Then, the transverse proﬁle of the wave function just behind the
barrier will be given by
(x, 0) ∼G(x −a, 0) + G(x + a, 0)
(2.56)

i.e., a superposition of two Gaussians, one centered at x = a and one centered at
x = −a.
Each Gaussian term just spreads out in time in the way we analyzed in the previous
section. (Formally, we can say that since the Schrödinger equation is linear in ,
the solution (x, t) for this initial state – a superposition of two Gaussians – is
just the corresponding superposition of the solutions for the two superposed terms
individually.) Thus, using Eq.(2.51) twice (but with one small tweak each time) we
can write

(2.58)
This is slightly messy to work with, but the idea qualitatively is that, as the two
individual Gaussians begin to spread, they start to overlap. But then there can be
either constructive or destructive interference depending on the relative phases in
the region of overlap. For example, along the symmetry line, x = 0, the phases
of the two terms will always match and we will therefore always have constructive
interference, corresponding to a large value of ||2, i.e., a high probability for the
particle (if looked for) to be detected. But if we move a little bit to the side (say,
in the positive x-direction) we are moving toward the central peak of one of the

47
Fig. 2.7 Density plot of ||2 from Eq.(2.58). A classic interference pattern emerges in the intensity
of the wave downstream from the “double Gaussian slit” barrier at the left edge of the image
Gaussians and away from the central peak of the other, and so the phases of the two
terms change at different rates, and eventually we ﬁnd a spot where there is (at least
for large y, nearly complete) destructive interference, corresponding to ||2 = 0.
Moving even farther in the positive x-direction eventually yields another spot where
there is constructive interference, and so on.
The intensity pattern that results is shown in Fig.2.7, which is again a Mathematica
density plot of |(x, y)|2, with (x, y) given by Eq.(2.58). It is the classic two-slit
interference pattern.
Of course, one should remember that such images of smoothly-distributed waves
only tell half the story according to quantum mechanics. When an individual particle
is looked for, it is not observed to be spread out like in these pictures; instead, it
is found at some one particular spot, with the smooth ||2 functions providing the
probability distribution for the discrete sharp “hit”. See, for example, in Fig.2.8,
the beautiful results of Tonomura et al. for a two-slit experiment with individual
electrons and, in Fig.2.9, the equally beautiful results of Dimitrova and Weis for a
similar experiment using individual photons.

Spin
Wewill haveoccasionlater todiscuss measurements of thespinof (spin1/2) particles.
For such measurements, there are only two possible outcomes – “spin up” along the
axis in question, or “spin down”. This makes spin a very simple and elegant system
to treat using the quantum formalism.
We can represent the “spin up along the z-axis” state this way:

distribution of such individual sharp locations, after many photons are detected. (Reproduced from

Note that these two-component vectors (technically “spinors”) are the eigenvectors
(with eigenvalues +1 and −1 respectively) of the spin-along-z operator, which can
be represented as a two-by-two matrix:
ˆσz =

.
(2.61)
Of course, this is quantum mechanics, so the two eigenstates of ˆσz are not the only
possible states – instead they merely form a basis for the space of possible states.
(Think of the spin up and spin down states here, ψ+z and ψ−z, as being like the energy
eigenstates for the particle-in-a-box potential. These are not the only possible states!
Instead, the general state is an arbitrary properly-normalized linear combination of
them.) Here, a general state can be written as
ψ = c+

+ c−
	 0

=
	 c+
c−

.
(2.62)
The expansion coefﬁcients c+ and c−should of course be understood to have their
usual, generalized Born rule meanings: if a particle is in the spin state ψ and its spin
along the z-axis is measured, the probability for the measurement to have outcome
“spin up along z” is P+ = |c+|2 whereas the probability for the measurement to
have outcome “spin down along z” is P−= |c−|2. And note that, since these are

50

the only two possible outcomes, the probabilities should sum to one. That is, proper
normalization for the general spin state ψ requires |c+|2 + |c−|2 = 1.
Things get a little more interesting when we consider the possibility of measuring
the spin of a particle along some axis other than the z-axis. We will only ever have
occasion to care about measurements along axes in (say) the x−z-plane. The operator
corresponding to spin measurements along the x-axis can be written

(with eigenvalue −1 corresponding to “spin down” along the x-direction).
The operator corresponding to spin measurements along an arbitrary direction ˆn
in the x-z-plane is
ˆσn = ˆn · ˆ⃗σ = cos(θ)ˆσz + sin(θ)ˆσx =
	cos(θ)
sin(θ)
sin(θ) −cos(θ)

(2.66)
where θ is the angle between ˆn and ˆz (toward ˆx). It is a simple exercise in linear
algebra to show that the eigenvectors of this matrix can be written
ψ+n =
	cos(θ/2)
sin(θ/2)

(2.67)
(with eigenvalue +1, corresponding to “spin up along n”) and
ψ−n =
	 sin(θ/2)
−cos(θ/2)

(2.68)
(with eigenvalue −1, corresponding to “spin down along n”). Notice that, for θ = 0,
these states correspond to ψ+z and ψ−z, as they should, and similarly for θ = 90◦,
they correspond to ψ+x and ψ−x.
Let’s consider a concrete example to illustrate these ideas. Suppose a particle is
prepared in the “spin up along n” state where n is a direction 60◦down from the
z-axis (toward the x-axis). That is, suppose

2.5 Spin
51
ψ0 =
	cos(30◦)
sin(30◦)

.
(2.69)
Then, we are going to measure the spin of this particle along the z-axis. What is the
probability that this z-spin measurement comes out “spin down”?
To answer this, as always, we have to write the given state as a linear combination
of the eigenstates of the operator corresponding to the measurement that is to be
performed. Here that means writing ψ0 as a linear combination of ψ+z and ψ−z. But
that is easy:
ψ0 =
	cos(30◦)
sin(30◦)

= cos(30◦)
	 1
0

+ sin(30◦)
	 0

.
(2.70)
So then we can read off that the probability of the measurement having outcome
“spin down along z” is the square of the expansion coefﬁcient on the “spin down
along z” term, i.e.,
P−z = sin2(30◦) = 1
4.
(2.71)
So if a whole beam of particles (all identically prepared in the state ψ0) is sent
into a Stern Gerlach device (with its axis aligned along the z direction), 25% of
the particles will emerge having been deﬂected “down” and the remaining 75% will
emerge having been deﬂected “up”.
2.6
Several Particles
So far all of the examples we’ve considered involve only a single particle (and in
particular its spatial or spin degrees of freedom). In situations involving two or more
particles, the principles are the same, but there are some important new possibilities
thatwillbecomeimportantinsubsequentchapters.Letuslaysomeofthegroundwork
here.
A crucial point is that, for an N-particle system, it is not the case that each of the
N particles has its own wave function. Instead, there is a single wave function for
the whole N-particle system. This wave function obeys the N-particle Schrödinger
equation

i (x1, x2, ..., xN, t) + V (x1, x2, ..., xN)(x1, x2, ..., xN, t).
(2.72)
Note that the wave function (x1, x2, ..., xN, t) is a (time-dependent) function on the
conﬁguration space of the N-particle system: x1 is the spatial coordinate of particle
1, x2 is the spatial coordinate of particle 2, etc.

Quantum Examples
As an example, consider the case of two particles (which have identical m and
which do not interact with each other) trapped in the box from Sect.2.2. The time-
dependent Schrödinger equation reads

where V is just the “particle-in-a-box” potential, Eq.(2.20).
It is easy to show, by separation of variables, that there are solutions of the form

(2.74)
which are products: one of the one-particle energy eigenfunctions for particle 1,
times one of the one-particle energy eigenfunctions for particle 2, and then with the
usual time-dependent phase factor involving the energy, which is just the sum of the
two one-particle energies.
If the two-particle quantum state is one of these product states, the wave function
 is formally a function on the two-particle conﬁguration space, but there is an
obvious sense in which each particle has its own deﬁnite state.
But, as usual in quantum mechanics, these states do not exhaust the possibilities
– instead, they merely form a basis for the space of all possible wave functions. And
that gives rise to the crucially-important concept of “entanglement”. An “entangled”
wave function (or quantum state) for several particles is simply one that is not a
product. An entangled state of two particles, that is, cannot be written as “some
wave function for particle 1” times “some wave function for particle 2”. In entangled
states, the individual particles really fail to have their own, individual, states.
Here is an example. Consider the two particles in the “box” potential, and suppose
we are only interested in the situation at t = 0 (so we ignore time-dependence). One
possible state for the two particles to be in is
1,2 = ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2)
(2.75)
corresponding to particle 1 being in the ground state and particle 2 being in the ﬁrst
excited state. Another possible state is
2,1 = ψ2(x1)ψ1(x2)
(2.76)
corresponding to particle 1 being in the ﬁrst excited state and particle 2 being in the
ground state. Neither of these states is particularly interesting or troubling since, for
each of them, each particle has its own deﬁnite state (with a deﬁnite energy).
But here is another possible state that the two-particle system could be in:

Fig. 2.10 The cartoon graph on the left indicates (in a very rough way) the structure (in the two-

function that is positive for all x1 between 0 and L, but then switches from being positive for
0 < x2 < L/2 to being negative for L/2 < x2 < L. So the product has a reasonably large
magnitude in roughly the grey-shaded areas and is positive and negative in the regions indicated.

This is a superposition of (on the one hand) a state in which particle 1 is in the ground
state and particle 2 is in the ﬁrst excited state and (on the other hand) a state in which
particle 2 is in the ﬁrst excited state and particle 2 is in the ground state. So neither
particle 1 nor particle 2 is in a state of deﬁnite energy at all. (Interestingly, though,
this entangled two-particle state is an eigenstate of the total energy: the two particles
deﬁnitely have a total energy of E1 + E2... there’s just no particular fact of the matter
about how this total energy is distributed between the two particles!)
It is perhaps helpful to practice visualizing these states in the two-particle con-
ﬁguration space. Figure2.10 shows sketchy cartoon versions of the two states 1,2
and 2,1. Each wave function is positive in one part, negative in another, and zero
between them.
The sum of these two states – the entangled superposition state in Eq.(2.77)
– is shown in this same sketchy cartoon style in Fig.2.11. There is (approximate)
destructive interference in the upper-left and lower-right corners of the conﬁguration
space, and instead constructive interference in the lower-left and upper-right corners.
So the state ent has a large positive value in the lower-left corner, a large negative
value in the upper-right corner, and is approximately zero elsewhere. Note that, since
the probability of ﬁnding the particles at positions x1 and x2 is ||2, this means that,
if the two particles are in the state ent, they are unlikely to be found at different
locations: the upper-left and lower-right corners of the conﬁguration space here
correspond, respectively, to “particle 1 is on the left and particle 2 is on the right”
and “particle 1 is on the right and particle 2 is on the left". These are precisely
the regions of conﬁguration space where  has a small amplitude and hence the
corresponding probability is small. On the other hand, the probabilities for ﬁnding

in conﬁguration space.
In the upper-left corner (i.e., 0 < x1 < L/2 and L/2 < x2 < L) the two superposed terms have
opposite sign and (partially) cancel out. The same thing happens in the lower-right corner. But in
the lower left corner (i.e., 0 < x1 < L/2 and 0 < x2 < L/2) the two superposed terms have the
same (positive) sign and hence add up to a function with a large (positive) value. The same thing
happens in the upper-right corner, but with “positive” replaced by “negative”
both particles “on the left” and ﬁnding both particles “on the right” are high. So
in some sense this particular entangled state is one in which neither particle has a
deﬁnite energy, and of course neither particle has a deﬁnite position either, and yet
there are certain correlations between them, i.e., certain joint properties that are more
well-deﬁned: the total energy of the two particles, for example, is perfectly deﬁnite,
and it is extremely likely that the particles will be found to be near one another if
their positions are measured.
That last sentence, by the way, should kind of blow your mind. So slow down and
let it percolate for a while if you didn’t already!
This example of two particles in a box has dealt exclusively with the spatial
degrees of freedom of two particles. Note that it is also possible for the spin degrees
of freedom of two particles to be entangled. For example, we might have two particles
in the joint spin state:

This can be understood as a superposition (with, for variety, a minus sign this time)
of (on the one hand) a state in which particle 1 is “spin up along z” and particle 2
is “spin down along z”, and then (on the other hand) a state in which particle 1 is
“spin down along z” and particle 2 is “spin up along z”. As in the previous example,
neither particle individually has a deﬁnite spin state, but there are certain correlations
between the particles’ spins; for example, here, if the z-spins of both particles are
measured, one cannot predict in advance whether it will be “particle 1 is spin up”
and “particle 2 is spin down” (which joint outcome has probability 50%) or instead

2.6 Several Particles

“particle 1 is spin down” and “particle 2 is spin up” (which also has probability
50%)... but one can predict in advance, with 100% certainty, that the outcomes of
the two spin measurements will be opposite – one “up” and one “down”.
You can play around a little bit more with this entangled spin state in the Projects
if you so choose. And then we will encounter it again soon when we discuss the
famous argument of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in Chap.4.
Projects:
(2.1) For the example from the Particle-in-a-box section – with (x, 0) given
by Eq.(2.27) – calculate the probability that a measurement of the parti-
cle’s position x at time t ﬁnds the particle on the left-hand-side of the box:
0 < x < L/2.
(2.2) Use Mathematica or a similar software package to make nice movies of the
exact evolution of the real and imaginary parts of (x, t) given by Eq.(2.29).
(2.3) A particle in a box starts in the state (x, 0) = 1/
√
L. What is (x, t)? What
is the probability that an energy measurement at time t yields the ground state
energy?
(2.4) Show explicitly that Eq.(2.26) satisﬁes the time-dependent Schrödinger
Equation.
(2.5) The uncertainty of some quantity A is deﬁned as: (A)2 = ⟨(A −⟨A⟩)2⟩=
⟨A2⟩−⟨A⟩2. Use this deﬁnition to calculate the exact uncertainty x of
the position for the Gaussian wave packet given by Eq.(2.33). Note that, for
example, ⟨x2⟩=

x2|(x)|2dx. (Here’s a clever way to do integrals of this
form:

x2e−ax2dx = −∂
∂a

e−ax2dx.) Then calculate also the uncertainty
k in the wave number using (2.47) and convert this into a statement about
the uncertainty in the momentum. What, exactly, is the product of x and
p? As it turns out, this Gaussian is a “minimum uncertainty wave packet”
– meaning that the product of x and p for this state is the smallest the
product can ever be. (But it can be and usually is bigger!) Summarize this
fact by writing down an exact mathematical statement of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.
(2.6) Work through the gory mathematical details of deriving Eq.(2.51) from
Eq.(2.50). Or better, develop a general formula for Gaussian integrals of
the form

e−Ak2eBk dk in terms of A and B. Then use the general formula
to show how (2.51) follows from (2.50).
(2.7) Show explicitly that the (x, t) in Eq.(2.51) solves the time-dependent
Schrödinger Equation.
(2.8) Use Mathematica (or some similar package) to make some nice animations
showing the time-evolution of (x, t) for the initially Gaussian wave packet,
Eq.(2.51).Forexample,whatdoestherealpartlooklike?Theimaginarypart?
The modulus squared?
(2.9) Suppose the initial wave function is a position eigenstate: (x, 0) =
δ(x −x′). What is (x, t)? Note that this is a very useful result, since
any initial wave function can be written as a linear combination of δ func-
tions in a rather trivial way: (x, 0) =

(x′, 0)δ(x −x′) dx. And of

56
2
Quantum Examples
course the Schrödinger equation is linear, so (x, t) is just that same lin-
ear combination of the time-evolved versions of δ(x −x′), i.e., (x, t) =

(x′, 0)G(x, x′, t) dx, where G(x, x′, t) is just the wave function that
(x, 0) = δ(x −x′) evolves into at time t. Use this alternative approach to
re-derive our expression for (x, t) for the initially Gaussian wave packet.
(2.10) Use the approach from Project 2.9 to write an expression for (x, t) for a
(x, 0) that is constant for −L/2 < x < L/2, and zero otherwise. This
expression will have some divergence issues. But you should be able to show
that in the t →∞limit, a certain simpliﬁcation allows you to derive a nice
result for (what can be understood as) the probability density associated with
(regular, non-Gaussian) single-slit diffraction (assuming the detection screen
is far behind the slit). Make a nice graph.
(2.11) Let’s try to understand the mathematics behind the idea, from Sect.2.4, of
trading out the t-dependence of our one-dimensional (x, t), using y =
vt, for a wave function that we interpret as a solution ψ(x, y) of the two-
dimensional TISE. Start with the Schrödinger Equation in two dimensions,
	 ∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + 2mi
ℏ
∂
∂t

(x, y, t) = 0,
(2.79)
and look for solutions of the form
(x, y, t) = φ(x, y)ei(ky−ωt)
(2.80)
corresponding to a plane wave propagating in the y-direction, but with a
slowly-varying y-dependent transverse proﬁle φ. (a) Plug Eq.(2.80) into
Eq.(2.79) and show that, for ω = ℏk2/2m and 2k ∂φ
∂y ≫∂2φ
∂y2 , φ should satisfy
∂2φ
∂x2 + 2ik ∂φ
∂y = 0.
(2.81)
(b) Explain why the two conditions used in (a) are reasonable and what they
mean physically. (c) Argue that, with y ↔vt (where v = ℏk/m), Eq.(2.81)
is just the one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation. [Note that
this technique is called the “paraxial approximation”.]
(2.12) A spin 1/2 particle is prepared in the state ψ−x (spin down along x). We then
perform a measurement of its spin along the same ˆn direction used in the
example in the text: 60◦down from the z-axis (toward the x-axis). Find the
probabilities for the two possible measurement outcomes.
(2.13) If a spin 1/2 particle is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B, the spin-up and spin-down
states (parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld direction) have different energies, which
one can capture with an appropriate Hamiltonian operator. For example, if
the magnetic ﬁeld is in the y-direction, we can write

where ω is a constant (with angular frequency units, hence the letter) that
depends on the magnetic dipole moment of the particle and the strength of
the ﬁeld. Use this Hamiltonian operator in Eq.(2.1) to ﬁnd out how the (spin)
state of a particle, say initially in the state ψ+z, evolves in time. (Hint: use
the general method outlined in the chapter of solving the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation, namely, ﬁrst ﬁnd the energy eigenstates, then write
the initial state as a linear combination of energy eigenstates, then tack the
appropriate time-dependent exponential factor onto each term in the linear
combination.)
(2.14) For the “two particles in a box” system, construct an entangled state in which
even the total energy of the two particles is not well-deﬁned. Use Mathematica
to make some density plots and/or movies showing how the state looks and
how it evolves in time.
(2.15) The “two particles in a box” system is mathematically isomorphic to a “one
particle in a two-dimensional box” system. Explain and contemplate.
(2.16) Re-write the “singlet” spin state for two spin 1/2 particles – Eq.(2.78) – in
terms of the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis states, ψ+x and ψ−x.
(2.17) Re-write the “singlet” spin state for two spin 1/2 particles – Eq.(2.78) – in
terms of the spin-up and spin-down along the n-axis states, ψ+n and ψ−n.

Chapter 3
The Measurement Problem
In Chap.2, we reviewed the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics and
practiced applying it to a number of concrete examples. In the present chapter, we
will begin the process of stepping back and turning a critical eye toward the theory.
In particular, in this chapter, we will look carefully at the curiously central role that
the theory gives to the process of “measurement” and discuss the network of related
concerns, centering on the infamous example of Schrödinger’s Cat, that have come
to be called “the measurement problem.”
3.1
The Quantum Description of Measurement
Our discussion of the examples in the previous Chapter focused on solving
Schrödinger’s equation to understand how the quantum states of microscopic sys-
tems evolve in time, and then using Born’s rule to connect these quantum states to
probabilities for various possible measurement outcomes. Here, we want to empha-
size and develop two additional aspects of Born’s rule, and then step back and look
at the quantum mechanical description of measurement and, really, the quantum
mechanical description of the world as a whole.
The ﬁrst new aspect of Born’s rule that we need to stress is the so-called “collapse
postulate”. Recall that, according to Born’s rule, we calculate the probabilities of
different measurement outcomes as follows: ﬁrst, write the quantum state  (of the
system we are measuring) as a linear combination of eigenstates of the operator
corresponding to the property we are measuring, as in

The Measurement Problem
where i is an eigenstate of the operator ˆA with eigenvalue Ai. Then the probability
for the measurement to have outcome Ai is P(Ai) = |ci|2. That should be familiar
and clear.
But it is an experimental fact that, if you immediately repeat a measurement –
for example, you measure the energy of a particle and then immediately measure its
energy again – you always get the same result for the second measurement that you
got for the ﬁrst. (Note how weird it would be if this weren’t true. At very least, the
word “measurement” would then seem quite inappropriate.) But then the consistent
applicability of Born’s rule to the two measurements implies that, by the time the
secondmeasurementoccurs,thesystemmustbeintheeigenstatecorrespondingtothe
outcomeoftheﬁrstmeasurement.Onlythis(accordingtoBorn’srule)willensurethat
the probability of seeing that same result again, in the second measurement, is 100%.
This is the collapse postulate: when a measurement occurs, and has outcome An, the
quantum state of the system being measured ceases to be whatever superposition it
might have been previously, and “collapses” to the eigenstate n whose eigenvalue
is the realized outcome An.
Formally, for a measurement that begins at time t1 and ends at time t2, one has
(t1) =

i
cii
→
(t2) = n.
(3.2)
where the right arrow indicates the time-evolution. The crucial point – and the reason
the “collapse postulate” is a postulate – is that this is a very different sort of time-
evolution than wave functions normally undergo, when they are evolving according
to Schrödinger’s equation.
The second new aspect of the Born rule then has to do with the idea of experiments
having deﬁnite outcomes. So far we have just used these words abstractly, without
really thinking in concrete physical terms about what we mean. So consider, for
example, the two-slit experiment described in the last Chapter. A single electron
(or photon) propagates through the apparatus, and we describe its state with a wave
function. But then, at some point, the particle interacts with the “detection screen”
that is being used to measure its position. This (as we have just been discussing)
apparently causes the wave function of the particle to “collapse” – to switch from
something that is spread out across (say) nearly the whole screen, to something more
like a δ-function spike at a particular spot.
But something important happens to the screen, as well! If, for example, we think
of the screen as a piece of ﬁlm, a certain little spot on the ﬁlm changes color. Or if we
think of it as a CCD array, an electrical signal is produced which (say) results in the
coordinates of the particular pixel that the particle “hit” being printed on a computer
screen. Whatever the details, exactly, the point is that the measuring device itself is
a physical thing, which undergoes some kind of observable physical change, that is
intimately coupled with the change (described by the collapse posulate) in the state
of the particle that happens at that same moment. The “measurement”, in short, is
a physical interaction between these two physical systems, which both change as a
result.

Fig. 3.1 The quantum particle-in-a-box (whose spatial degree of freedom is called x) is shown
on the left; the curve is meant to indicate its wave function (though one should be careful not to
take this picture too literally!). Then there is an energy-measurement device which will perform the
measurement. The device has a macroscopic pointer, which we can idealize as a single, very heavy
particle with horizontal coordinate y. Prior to the measurement-interaction, the pointer is sitting in
its “ready” position (y0); after the measurement interaction, the pointer will move to a new position
which indicates the outcome of the measurement: y1 will mean that the energy of the particle is E1,
etc
Let us set up a semi-realistic concrete example to consider, involving the “pointer”
conceptintroducedinChap.1.Supposeourmicroscopicquantumsystemisaparticle-
in-a-box, which has been prepared so that its state is a superposition of the ﬁrst few
energy eigenstates. Say:
ψ0 = c1ψ1 + c2ψ2 + c3ψ3
(3.3)
where ψ1 is the n = 1 (i.e., ground state) particle-in-a-box wave function, etc. And
suppose that we are planning to wait a few seconds and then measure the energy of the
particle-in-a-box. This measurement will be performed using some kind of energy-
measuring apparatus, which we will treat schematically as a black box (with internal
workings whose details we need not worry about too much) with a macroscopic
pointer whose position, after the interaction, will indicate the result of the energy
measurement. See Fig.3.1.
So then the quantum mechanical description of the measurement process goes like
this. The particle-in-a-box is described by a wave function, which starts as ψ0 and
then evolves according to the Schrödinger equation until the measurement is made.
The pointer, meanwhile, starts out at position y = y0 and just sits there (obeying
Fnet = ma with Fnet = 0) until the measurement is made.
At some point, the measurement interaction occurs and when the dust settles, the
situation is now as follows: the wave function of the particle-in-the-box has collpased
to one of the energy eigenfunctions ψn (with n being either 1, or 2, or 3); and the
apparatus pointer has moved and is now pointing at the appropriate corresponding
value, y = yn. (See Fig.3.2 for an illustration of one of the three possibilities.)
With the interaction between the particle-in-the-box and the measuring apparatus
now completed, each part – the particle-in-the-box and the apparatus pointer – con-
tinue evolving as normal (i.e., the wave function of the particle-in-the-box evolves

Fig. 3.2 One of the three possible post-measurement states of the particle-in-a-box and measure-
ment apparatus pointer: the wave function of the PIB has “collapsed” to ψ2 and the pointer has
moved to position y2, indicating that the energy measurement had outcome E2
according to the Schrödinger equation, and the apparatus pointer again obeys
Fnet = ma with, presumably, Fnet = 0 again).
Now there are two curious and connected things about all of this, one dynamical
and one more ontological.
The curious thing, dynamically, is that the measurement interaction seems to
involve a violation of the “usual” dynamics for each of the interacting objects. We
have already pointed out that the “collapse” that occurs to the wave function of the
particle-in-the-box is not (or at least is not obviously, not apparently) something that
is described by Schrödinger’s equation. The wave function, during that brief time
period, collapses instead of evolving in accordance with Schrödinger’s equation. And
then something similar occurs with the pointer, although the schematic nature of the
example makes this a little harder to see. The claim here is meant to be something
like: “Fnet = ma ceases to apply to the pointer when it suddenly swerves from y0
to yn for some particular value of n.” But of course, that cannot be exactly true.
The pointer is, after all, just the last step in a long causal chain. The (say, magnetic)
force on it – which results in it moving some particular distance to the right during
the course of the interaction – can be perfectly explained in terms of (say) electrical
currents that ﬂow through some wires inside the black box part of the apparatus. But
those currents can, in turn, be perfectly explained, in standard classical Maxwellian
electrodynamical terms, by (say) other electrical currents, in the cable, i.e., further
upstream along the causal chain. And so on... but at some point, we must come to
some change in some aspect of the physical state of the apparatus for which the usual
classical dynamical rules do not provide an explanation. Otherwise, why would we
need quantum mechanics at all?
This brings us to the other curious thing about this whole situation: the apparatus
is being described in classical terms! We do not speak, for example, of “the wave
function of the pointer,” but instead of the pointer’s position. The whole setup and
description, that is, presupposes that the pointer (and presumably most of the con-
tents of the entire black box, at least until we get far upstream into some murky
meso- or micro-scopic stuff) is the kind of thing to which we can just unproblemati-
cally attribute deﬁnite, sharp, unambiguous, un-superposed, classical properties. The

3.1 The Quantum Description of Measurement
63
picture, that is, seems to presume that quantum systems (described in terms of wave
functions) exist in addition to classical systems (described, for example, in terms
of particles with deﬁnite positions). If this kind of description is taken seriously, as
faithfully capturing the true nature of the world being described, it implies for exam-
ple that there are two fundamentally different types of particles in the world: those
(like our particle-in-a-box here) which are “wavy” (i.e., which are properly described
in terms of a spatially-spread-out wave function) and those (like the particle(s) com-
posing the pointer here) which are “sharp” (i.e., which are properly described as
having deﬁnite positions at all times).
At the broadest level, then, it seems like the implied quantum mechanical pic-
ture of the world goes something like the following. There is, to begin with, the
familiar macroscopic “classical” realm in which things have deﬁnite properties and
are described in clear, everyday terms. This macroscopic realm basically obeys the
dynamical laws of classical mechanics. Then there is also a microscopic realm
where our everyday classical intuitions don’t apply and we must instead describe
things using quantum mechanical wave functions which, of course, do not necessar-
ily attribute deﬁnite properties to things: energy, momentum, position, etc., can all
be “smeared out” in quantum superpositions, i.e., these properties can fail to have
deﬁnite values in the way we would have expected classically.
And then ﬁnally there are the special rules describing the interaction of the macro-
scopic and microscopic realms. In particular, during a measurement, the quantum
mechanical wave function describing the microscopic system fails, momentarily, to
evolve in accordance with Schrödinger’s equation, and instead collapses to one par-
ticular eigenstate of the operator corresponding to the physical property (energy or
momentum or whatever) that is being measured. Which particular eigenstate? This
is supposed to be irreducibly random and inexplicable, but the particular state that
the quantum system collapses to is the one that corresponds to the particular mea-
surement outcome that is displayed by the apparatus, as a result of its own process of
jumping, inexplicably and in violation of the usual (here, classical) dynamical rules.
Stepping back, all of this should make one feel very uncomfortable. To begin
with, there is a kind of schizophrenic division of the world into two “realms” (the
microscopic quantum part, and the macroscopic classical part) which seem to have
completely different ontologies and completely different dynamical laws. And then
there are apparently special dynamical rules which come into play when the two
realms interact, during a “measurement”. And the situation is then made worse by the
vagueness of the concept “measurement”. If you say “during measurements, quan-
tum wave functions momentarily cease to obey Schrödinger’s equation and instead
collapse” that is already weird and troubling, but it becomes downright meaningless if
you can’t specify exactly what kinds of physical processes count as “measurements”.
Bell put this particular point very sharply as follows:
What exactly qualiﬁes some physical systems to play the role of ‘measurer’? Was the wave-
function of the world waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled
living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer, for some better qualiﬁed
system ... with a Ph.D.? If the theory is to apply to anything but highly idealised laboratory
operations, are we not obliged to admit that more or less ‘measurement-like’ processes are

64

The Measurement Problem
going on more or less all the time, more or less everywhere? Do we not have [quantum]
jumping [i.e., collapse] then all the time? [1]
It indeed seems necessary to admit that “measurements” are ubiquitous, and occur
even in places and times where there are no human experimenters. But it also seems
hopelesstothinkthatwewillbeabletogiveanappropriatelysharpanswertotheques-
tion of what, exactly, differentiates the ‘ordinary’ processes (where the usual dynami-
cal rules apply) from the ‘measurement-like’ processes (where the rules momentarily
change).
In an interview, Bell was once asked whether he thought the problems with quan-
tum mechanics were philosophical or experimental. His answer is relevant here:
I think there are professional problems. That is to say, I’m a professional theoretical physicist
and I would like to make a clean theory. And when I look at quantum mechanics I see that
it’s a dirty theory. The formulations of quantum mechanics that you ﬁnd in the books involve
dividing the world into an observer and an observed, and you are not told where that division
comes – on which side of my spectacles it comes, for example – or at which end of my optic
nerve. You’re not told about this division between the observer and the observed. What you
learn in the course of your apprenticeship is that for practical purposes it does not much
matter where you put this division; that the ambiguity is at a level of precision far beyond
human capability of testing. So you have a theory which is fundamentally ambiguous... [2].
Stepping back, it begins to seem like we must have taken the quantum mechanical
“recipe” – Born’s rule and the collapse postulate in particular – too literally, somehow.
Surely, for example, big macroscopic things like measuring devices and their pointers
(not to mention cats and trees and planets) are just large collections of electrons and
other microscopic particles. And so surely, if macroscopic stuff is literally made of
lots and lots of little microscopic parts, then shouldn’t a fully microscopic description
sufﬁce, at least in principle even if not in practice? In other words, shouldn’t the
familiar macroscopic world (meaning large objects with deﬁnite, classical properties,
that at least approximately obey Newton’s laws of motion) somehow emerge from the
more fundamental quantum mechanical description, as opposed to being postulated
at the fundamental level?
3.2
Formal Treatment
Let us explore this possibility in a more formal way here. (Doing this will help us
understand the point Schrödinger meant to be making with his cat example, when
we turn to that shortly.)
Take the example from the previous section – measuring the energy of a particle-
in-a-box – but now let us attempt to use the microscopic type of quantum description
(in terms of wave functions obeying Schrödinger’s equation) for the entire setup,
including the measuring apparatus. Suppose, as before, that the particle-in-a-box
starts out in the state
ψ0(x) = c1ψ1(x) + c2ψ2(x) + c3ψ3(x).
(3.4)

3.2 Formal Treatment
65
As for the pointer, previously we had been describing it classically and hence attribut-
ing to it some deﬁnite pre-measurement position y0. But now we want to instead
describe the pointer quantum mechanically, with a wave function. Let’s say that the
pointer in its “ready position” can be described by a Gaussian wave packet centered
on the position y0:
φ(y) = Ne−(y−y0)2/4σ2.
(3.5)
At the moment (call it t = 0) when the measurement interaction begins, the joint
wave function of the particle and pointer will be
0(x, y) = ψ0(x)φ(y).
(3.6)
This quantum system will then evolve in time in accordance with the Schrödinger
equation,
iℏ∂(x, y, t)
∂t
= ˆH(x, y, t).
(3.7)
But what is the Hamiltonian, ˆH? Evidently there will be three contributions. First,
it will include the usual terms corresponding to the kinetic and potential energies of
the particle-in-the-box, whose degree of freedom is “x”:
ˆHx = −ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂x2 + V (x).
(3.8)
As we saw in Chap.2, ˆHx gives each term in Eq.(3.4) a time-dependent complex
phase, with distinct frequencies for the different terms.
Second, the overall Hamiltonian should include the kinetic energy of the pointer,
whose degree of freedom is “y”:
ˆHy = −ℏ2
2M
∂2
∂y2 .
(3.9)
As we saw in Chap.2, ˆHy will tend to make the wave packet (describing here the
state of the pointer) spread in time. But recall that our single pointer particle is just a
schematic way of describing what is, in fact, some enormous macroscopic collection
of elementary particles. We should thus probably attribute to our pointer particle a
very large mass M. This means – recall Eq.2.53 – that the packet will spread very
slowly. Or even more simply, it warrants making the following approximation:
ˆHy ≈0.
(3.10)
The third (and here most important) contribution to the Hamiltonian will be the
one describing the interaction of the particle and the pointer. Of course, in reality,
this interaction would be quite indirect and quite complicated, mediated somehow

66
3
The Measurement Problem
by all the other particles composing the apparatus. For our schematic treatment,
though, all we really want to ensure is the following: if the particle were to start
out deﬁnitely in an energy eigenstate ψn, then the pointer should move sideways by
a distance proportional to En, the corresponding energy eigenvalue. That, after all,
is what pointers on measuring devices do, rather by deﬁnition – they register the
outcome of the measurement by their positions, and if the particle starts out in an
energy eigenstate, then we know the outcome will deﬁnitely be that corresponding
eigenvalue.
It turns out that an interaction Hamiltonian of the following form will achieve
this:
ˆHint = λ ˆHx ˆpy = −iℏλ ˆHx
∂
∂y .
(3.11)
Here λ is a constant; ˆHx is the energy operator for the particle in the box, i.e., ˆHx
is the operator corresponding to the quantity that we are measuring; and ˆpy is the
momentum operator for the pointer.
Let’s see why this works. Suppose again that the particle starts out in an energy
eigenstate, so that the particle-pointer initial wave function is
(x, y, 0) = ψn(x)φ(y).
(3.12)
Now for simplicity assume that λ (which describes the strength of the interaction) is
very large, so that – during the period in which the interaction is occurring – we can
ignore any other terms in the overall Hamiltonian. Then the Schrödinger equation
reads
iℏ∂
∂t = ˆHint = −iℏλ ˆHx
∂
∂y .
(3.13)
Simplifying a bit gives
∂
∂t = −λ ˆHx
∂
∂y .
(3.14)
One sees that the t- and y-dependencies of  are coupled, but the variable x is not
involved. We may thus assume that (x, y, t) remains proportional to ψn(x) and
hence remains an eigenstate of ˆHx, so that the previous equation simpliﬁes to
∂
∂t = −λEn
∂
∂y .
(3.15)
It is then straightforward to check that the solution is
(x, y, t) = ψn(x)φ(y −λEnt).
(3.16)
Suppose the interaction lasts until a time t = T . Then the quantum state of the
particle-pointer system at the end of the interaction is evidently

3.2 Formal Treatment
67
(x, y, T ) = ψn(x)φ(y −λEnT )
(3.17)
which can be understood as follows: the particle-in-the-box remains in the nth energy
eigenstate, and the pointer remains a Gaussian wave packet but whose center has
moved, to the right, a distance λEnT so that it is now centered at y0 + λEnT which
we can identify as yn – the ﬁnal location of the pointer when it registers the nth energy
value.
Tosummarize,the(admittedlyweird-looking)interactionHamiltonian,Eq.(3.11),
does exactly the job we wanted: it makes the pointer move a distance proportional to
the energy of the particle when the particle actually begins with a particular, deﬁnite
energy. So it seems like this model – with this interaction Hamiltonian – provides a
schematic, but still faithful, way of capturing all the complicated physical interac-
tions that in fact couple the particle-in-the-box to the apparatus pointer in this kind
of situation.
(A technical aside: if you are worried that we dropped something important, either
by ignoring ˆHx during the measurement interaction, or by setting the mass of the
pointer to inﬁnity and hence ignoring ˆHy, you shouldn’t be. Including ˆHx would
only have the effect of giving an extra factor e−i Ent/ℏin Eq.(3.17) – a meaningless
overall phase. And if we had included a term corresponding to the kinetic energy
of the pointer, this would only have the effect of making the pointer wave packet
spread slightly during the course of the interaction. This also doesn’t really change
anything important, so the approximations made above really do seem to capture
what is essential. You are invited to explore this in the Projects if you want to.)
So far so good. But of course we are not so interested in the special case where the
particle starts out with a deﬁnite energy. We want to know what happens when the par-
ticle starts out in the superposition state, Eq.(3.4), and we try to treat the measurement
interaction fully quantum mechanically – i.e., without bringing in any ad hoc extra
postulates about exceptions to the Schrödinger evolution, the pointer always having
a classical position, etc. Remember, the hope is that, if we just use the purely micro-
scopic part of quantum mechanics – wave functions obeying Schrödinger’s equation
– to describe the entire interaction between the two systems, everything will work out
the way we want it to: the ﬁnal quantum state will attribute an approximately-deﬁnite
position to the pointer, the wave function of the particle-in-a-box will be one of the
energy eigenstates, etc.
But, sadly, our hope is immediately dashed. It is very easy to see – from the fact
that the overall Schrödinger equation is linear – that with
ˆH = ˆHint
(3.18)
and
(x, y, 0) =

i
ciψi(x)

φ(y)
(3.19)
the wave function at time T (when the measurement interaction ceases) is

68
3
The Measurement Problem
(x, y, T ) =

i
ci ψi(x) φ(y −λEiT ).
(3.20)
This represents an entangled superposition of several states, in each of which the
particle has a deﬁnite energy and the pointer’s position is slightly fuzzy but centered
on a deﬁnite position corresponding to the energy of the particle. But of course, the
energy of the particle, and the post-measurement position of the pointer, are different
in each of the superposed states. And that is seriously problematic. The particle-in-a-
box does not end up in a particular energy eigenstate at all, and (worse!) the pointer
is not localized around any particular one of (what we thought of previously as) its
possible ﬁnal positions.
To summarize: if you try to treat the measurement process using just the micro-
scopic part of quantum mechanics, it simply doesn’t give you what you want, which
is some kind of explanation for the emergence of one deﬁnite outcome (pointer posi-
tion). Instead of somehow resolving the initial ambiguity in the energy of the particle,
and thereby causing the particle to end up with a deﬁnite energy and the pointer to
end up in a deﬁnite place, the interaction between the particle-in-the-box and the
pointer infects the pointer with its quantum ambiguity!
Now you might think that this result is simply a consequence of our having treated
the measurement process so schematically. Perhaps a more detailed, more realistic,
quantum mechanical description of the measuring apparatus and its interaction with
the quantum system, would yield the desired result? Unfortunately it is easy to see
that this cannot possibly work. You can include as many of those intermediate degrees
of freedom as you want, making the description as realistic and as accurate as you
like, and still it won’t make any difference to the outcome. Here’s why. Suppose we
include another intermediate degree of freedom, called z, so that now the initial state
is something like
(x, y, z, 0) =

i
ciψi(x)

φ(y)χ0(z).
(3.21)
Schrödinger’s equation reads
iℏ∂
∂t = ˆH.
(3.22)
Since we mean to be describing a measurement of the particle’s energy, we demand
that the Hamiltonian ˆH have the property that if
(x, y, z, 0) = ψn(x)φ(y)χ0(z)
(3.23)
then
(x, y, z, T ) = ψn(x)φ(y −λEnT )χn(z).
(3.24)
That is, we demand that the position of the pointer should move, by an amount
proportional to En, when the particle starts out in an energy eigenstate with energy

3.2 Formal Treatment
69
En. (And the intermediate degree of freedom ends up in some associated state.)
But then it is obvious, again from the linearity of the Schrödinger equation, that in
the general case where the particle starts out in a superposition of energies, as in
Eq.(3.21), it ends up in the entangled superposition state
(x, y, z, T ) =

i
ciψi(x)φ(y −λEiT )χi(z).
(3.25)
The intermediate degree of freedom just gets infected with the superposition, too.
Including it – or, indeed, including as many such intermediate degrees of freedom
as you might want and thereby making the description as complete and accurate and
unschematic as you might want – changes nothing. Our simple schematic treatment
brought out the essential and inevitable problem already.
3.3
Schrödinger’s Cat and Einstein’s Bomb
The most famous illustration of the problem described in the last section was pre-
sented by Schrödinger in the last section of his 1935 paper, “The present situation in
quantum mechanics.” [3] Actually, in that paper, Schrödinger illustrates the problem
several times, with several different examples. Here, for instance, is his discussion
of the case of a radioactive nucleus emitting an alpha particle:
[the ψ-] function has provided quite intuitive and convenient ideas, for instance the ‘cloud
of negative electricity’ around the nucleus, etc. But serious misgivings arise if one notices
that the uncertainty affects macroscopically tangible and visible things, for which the term
‘blurring’ seems simply wrong. The state of a radioactive nucleus is presumably blurred
in such degree and fashion that neither the instant of decay nor the direction, in which
the emitted α-particle leaves the nucleus, is well-established. Inside the nucleus, blurring
doesn’t bother us. The emerging particle is described, if one wants to explain intuitively,
as a spherical wave that continuously emanates in all directions from the nucleus and that
impinges continuously on a surrounding luminescent screen over its full expanse. The screen
however does not show a more or less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up
at one instant at one spot – or, to honor the truth, it lights up now here, now there, for it
is impossible to do the experiment with only a single radioactive atom. If in place of the
luminescent screen one uses a spatially extended detector, perhaps a gas that is ionised by the
α-particles, one ﬁnds the ion pairs arranged along rectilinear columns, that project backwards
on to the bit of radioactive matter from which the α-radiation comes (C.T.R. Wilson’s cloud
chamber tracks, made visible by drops of moisture condensed on the ions) [3].
The idea here is illustrated in Fig.3.3. Schrödinger’s point is that, according to quan-
tum mechanics, the α particle emitted by a radioactive nucleus is not going in any
particular direction. Instead, the theory describes it as coming out of the nucleus in
a superposition of all possible directions, which is mathematically equivalent to a
spherically symmetric, outward-propagating wave function. It is easy to understand
how a ﬂash – at a particular location on the screen – could be created by an α particle
that had been emitted in a particular direction, namely, toward that particular spot.

70
3
The Measurement Problem
Fig. 3.3 A radioactive nucleus emits an alpha particle which then causes a visible scintillation on
a surrounding circular detection screen. The left panel shows that, if the alpha particle is emitted in
a particular direction, the scintillation will occur at a spot on the screen in that same direction. But
if both the alpha particle and the detection screen are treated quantum mechanically, the linearity
of Schrödinger’s equation implies that if the alpha particle is emitted in a superposition of different
directions (say, a spherically symmetric wave function propagating outward) the ﬁnal quantum state
will be an entangled superposition involving terms with scintillations in all directions on the screen.
That is, the microscopic quantum dynamics cannot explain how it is that the ﬂash is seen to occur
at just some one particular spot on the screen
But if the emission of the alpha particle is really somehow spherically symmetric,
there seems to be nothing in the microscopic part of quantum mechanics to break
the symmetry and explain the ﬂash occuring at a particular spot.
The situation here can be described quantum mechanically in the same way we
describedthemeasurement process inthelast section. Take ψn tobethewavefunction
of an α-particle that has a reasonably sharply-deﬁned propagation direction θn, and
take φ0 to be the wave function of a photo-luminescent screen on which no ﬂashes
have yet appeared. Then the idea is that the overall wave function (for the α particle
and screen jointly) would evolve, under Schrödinger’s equation, as follows:
ψnφ0 →ψnφn
(3.26)
where φn is the wave function for the photo-luminescent screen with a bright ﬂash
at angle θn.
But then this immediately implies – from the linearity of Schrödinger’s equation
– that if (as is in fact the case in this kind of situation) the wave function of the α
particle is a (say, spherically symmetric) superposition
ψsph ∼

i
ψi
(3.27)
the state will evolve, under Schrödinger’s equation, as follows:

3.3 Schrödinger’s Cat and Einstein’s Bomb
71
ψsphφ0 →

i
ψiφi.
(3.28)
This is of course an entangled superposition of states; each term in the superposition
has the alpha particle being emitted in a particular direction and the screen ﬂashing at
a particular point, but the superposition as a whole includes such terms corresponding
to all possible directions. No one particular direction is picked out, either for the alpha
particle or for the ﬂash. As Schrödinger points out, though, this democratic wave
function does not seem to correspond appropriately to what we actually observe in
this kind of case, which is a ﬂash at some particular deﬁnite location: “The screen
however does not show a more or less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights
up at one instant at one spot” [3].
Schrödinger immediately continues the discussion by describing the case of the
famous cat:
One can even set up quite ridiculous cases. A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with
the following diabolical device (which must be secured against direct interference by the
cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps
in the course of one hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps
none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer which
shatters a small ﬂask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an
hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The ﬁrst
atomic decay would have poisoned it. The ψ-function of the entire system would express
this by having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out
in equal parts [3].
To put some formalism to this, we would say that, in the course of the hour, the sin-
gle radioactive atom evolves (according to Schrödinger’s equation) into an equally-
weighted superposition of decayed and not-yet-decayed states:
ψ0 →
1
√
2
ψdecayed + 1
√
2
ψnot decayed.
(3.29)
If we treated the surrounding equipment classically, and applied the collapse postu-
late, we would say that when the atom interacts with (say) the Geiger counter, this
interaction triggers a collapse and it thereby becomes unambiguously the case that
either the atom has decayed and the Geiger counter has clicked, or the atom has
not decayed and the Geiger counter has not clicked. Then, a classical interaction
(mediated by the hammer and ﬂask of acid) between the Geiger counter and the cat
would result in the cat deﬁnitely being alive if the Geiger counter did not click, and
the cat deﬁnitely being dead if the Geiger counter did click.
However, if we instead treat the surrounding apparatus quantum mechanically,
we ﬁnd that the ﬁnal state is something like the following:
 f =
1
√
2
ψdecayed φshattered χdead +
1
√
2
ψnot decayed φintact χalive.
(3.30)

72
3
The Measurement Problem
This is a superposition of two states: (i) a state in which the atom is decayed, the
hammer is down and the ﬂask of poison is shattered, and the cat is dead; and (ii)
a state in which the atom is not decayed, the hammer is up and the ﬂask of poison
is intact, and the cat is alive. In particular, this is not a state in which there is any
deﬁnite fact of the matter about whether the cat is dead or alive. The poor cat is, in
Schrödinger’s words, “mixed or smeared out” between living and dead.
As a bit of historical context, it is perhaps interesting to note that in the weeks
leading up to Schrödinger’s submitting the paper containing the cat example, he
was exchanging letters with Einstein. And in one of his letters to Schrödinger (from
August 8, 1935), Einstein suggested an example that illustrates the same basic point
illustrated by the cat:
The system is a substance in chemically unstable equilibrium, perhaps a charge of gunpow-
der that, by means of intrinsic forces, can spontaneously combust, and where the average
life span of the whole setup is a year. In principle this can quite easily be represented
quantum-mechanically. In the beginning the ψ-function characterizes a reasonably well-
deﬁned macroscopic state. But, according to your equation, after the course of a year this
is no longer the case at all. Rather, the ψ-function then describes a sort of blend of not-yet
and of already-exploded systems. Through no art of interpretation can this ψ-function be
turned into an adequate description of a real state of affairs; [for] in reality there is just no
intermediary between exploded and not-exploded [4, p. 78].
So perhaps the basic idea of the “Schrödinger’s cat” example actually started with
Einstein? This is again suggested by a later letter in which Einstein seems to get
slightly confused and mixes the two examples together in an amusing way:
Dear Schrödinger,
.... I am as convinced as ever that the wave representation of matter is an incomplete repre-
sentation of the state of affairs, no matter how practically useful it has proved itself to be.
The prettiest way to show this is by your example with the cat (radioactive decay with an
explosion coupled to it). At a ﬁxed time parts of the ψ-function correspond to the cat being
alive and other parts to the cat being pulverized.
If one attempts to interpret the ψ-function as a complete description of a state, independent
of whether or not it is observed, then this means that at the time in question the cat is
neither alive nor pulverized. But one or the other situation would be realized by making an
observation.
If one rejects this interpretation then one must assume that the ψ-function does not express
the real situation but rather that it expresses the contents of our knowledge of the situation.
This is Born’s interpretation, which most theorists today probably share. But then the laws
of nature that one can formulate do not apply to the change with time of something that
exists, but rather to the time variation of the content of our legitimate expectations.
Both points of view are logically unobjectionable; but I cannot believe that either of these
viewpoints will ﬁnally be established.
There is also the mystic, who forbids, as being unscientiﬁc, an inquiry about something
that exists independently of whether or not it is observed, i.e., the question as to whether or
not the cat is alive at a particular instant before an observation is made (Bohr). Then both
interpretations fuse into a gentle fog, in which I feel no better than I do in either of the
previously mentioned interpretations, which do take a position with respect to the concept
of reality.

3.3 Schrödinger’s Cat and Einstein’s Bomb
73
I am as convinced as ever that this most remarkable situation has come about because we
have not yet achieved a complete description of the actual state of affairs.
Of course I admit that such a complete description would not be observable in its entirety in
the individual case, but from a rational point of view one also could not require this....
Best regards from
Yours, A. Einstein [5, pp. 35-6]
In any case, whoever deserves credit for originating the example, it is nice to know
that Schrödinger and Einstein agreed about what it established. Here, for example, is
Einstein – again writing to Schrödinger – now on Sept 4, 1935, just after Schrödinger
submitted his manuscript:
...your cat shows that we are in complete agreement concerning our assessment of the char-
acter of the current theory. A ψ-function that contains the living as well as the dead cat just
cannot be taken as a description of a real state of affairs. To the contrary, this example shows
exactly that it is reasonable to let the ψ-function correspond to a statistical ensemble that
contains both systems with live cats and those with dead cats [4, p. 84].
For Einstein and Schrödinger, then, the cat/bomb example strongly suggested that,
rather than providing direct, literal, complete descriptions of physical systems, quan-
tum mechanical wave functions should instead be understood as describing our
incomplete knowledge – our ignorance – about the physical states of these sys-
tems. As Einstein puts it here, the wave function (attributing, typically, a range of
possible values to various system properties) should not be understood as a complete
description of an individual system, but should instead be understood as character-
izing a statistical ensemble of systems with some variation among the individual
members of the ensemble. We will discuss this alternative viewpoint in more detail
in the following section.
But, after all this talk of dead cats and exploding bombs, let’s close this section
with a slightly-happier image of Schrödinger’s cat as re-envisaged by Bell. In Bell’s
re-telling – See Fig.3.4 – the poison which is either released, or not, is replaced by
Fig. 3.4 Bell’s version of Schrödinger’s cat. The state of the radioactive nucleus (“A” for “not
decayed” and “B” for “decayed”) becomes entangled with the delivery (or not) of milk into the
cat’s dish and thereby also with the size of the cat’s stomach (“T ” for “thin” and “F” for “fat”).

a portion of milk that is either released, or not, into a dish, for the cat to drink. If the
nucleus decays, the cat gets fed and ends up fat – whereas if the nucleus does not
decay, the cat does not get fed and ends up thin. But in either case he survives!
3.4
Hidden Variables and the Ignorance Interpretation
In recent popular culture, Schrödinger’s cat has become a kind of symbol or emblem
of the weirdness of quantum mechanics. Many people therefore have the impres-
sion that Schrödinger thought the cat really would end up “mixed or smeared out”
between live and dead, and that one simply had to accept this as true despite its
incomprehensibility. But that is completely wrong. In fact, Schrödinger intended the
cat thought experiment as a reductio ad absurdum of the idea that quantum mechan-
ical wave functions provide complete descriptions of physical systems. The idea was
that, in this kind of case, quantum mechanics implies something that is (at least in the
opinion of Schrödinger and Einstein) obviously wrong. The pointer does not in fact
end up in some kind of superposition of different locations, but rather points to one
particular spot. The screen around the radioactive nucleus “does not show a more or
less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up at one instant at one spot”.
And the cat is most certaintly either (fully, deﬁnitely) alive or (fully, deﬁnitely) dead
– not both alive and dead, “mixed or smeared out in equal parts.” [3]
Schrödinger summarizes his point as follows just after presenting the cat example:
It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain
becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct
observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a ‘blurred model’ for rep-
resenting reality. In itself it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is
a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog
banks [3].
He continues shortly after by noting that, with the cat example,
we saw that the indeterminacy is not even an actual blurring, for there are always cases where
an easily executed observation provides the missing knowledge [3].
I would summarize Schrödinger’s point here this way. If we describe the entire mea-
surement process using the microscopic part of quantum mechanics, the theory tells
us that the measuring apparatus (or some other macroscopic object like the cat) ends
up in its own ambiguous, superposed state. But we know this cannot be a complete
descriptionofthestateofsuchthings sincedirectobservationrevealsthatsuchobjects
are always in perfectly deﬁnite states. Therefore, at least when it is used to describe
the state of macroscopic things, the quantum mechanical description cannot be com-
plete: the ambiguity of quantum superposition must (as Einstein also remarked in the
letter quoted in the previous section) refer to our ignorance about which of several
possibilities is in fact realized, as opposed to describing an objective blurring in the
physical state of the object itself. This, I think, is the point of the intriguing sentence
“There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of

3.4 Hidden Variables and the Ignorance Interpretation
75
clouds and fog banks.” He is suggesting that quantum mechanical wave functions,
thought of as describing or depicting the objective physical states of things, are not
like (sharp, in-focus) photographs of clouds – i.e., faithful reproductions of things
which are themselves, objectively, smeared out and fuzzy. Instead, he means to sug-
gest, we should understand quantum mechanical wave functions as like “shaky or
out-of-focus photograph[s]” of objects that are, in themselves, perfectly sharp. In
this kind of case, the smeared out or fuzzy character does not pertain to the object
described, but is instead a kind of failing or imperfection in the reproduction process.
But surely there is no fundamental distinction between microscopic and macro-
scopic systems (the latter, after all, literally being made of the former). This, I think,
is the point of including, in the cat example, the detailed description of the interme-
diate parts of the mechanism – the causal chain – whereby the state of the nucleus
is coupled to the state of the cat. Surely, Schrödinger invites us to think, there is no
particular spot along this continuous chain between micro and macro where it would
make sense to draw a sharp line and say “different dynamical laws start applying
here”. But if the micro and the macro must be treated uniformly, and if the quantum
mechanical description (in terms of wave functions) of macroscopic systems (like
cats and pointers) is not complete, then surely this is also the case for microscopic
systems.
If that’s right, then, for example, when we say that the particle-in-the-box is in a
superposition of several different energy eigenstates,
ψ0 = c1ψ1(x) + c2ψ2(x) + c3ψ3(x),
(3.31)
what this must mean is that the particle is either in the state ψ1(x) or the state ψ2(x)
or the state ψ3(x)... we’re just not sure which one! It’s not that the energy of the
particle is somehow blurred or indeﬁnite – rather, it’s only our knowledge which is
blurred or indeﬁnite. The energy is uncertain (in the literal sense, meaning “unknown
to us”) but it is perfectly sharp, some one deﬁnite value or another, in reality. And
then, if the energy is measured, we simply ﬁnd out what the energy was all along.
Or similarly, when we say that the wave function of the emitted alpha particle is
spherically symmetric, what this means, according to this viewpoint, is just that we
have no idea which direction the alpha particle is going. The subjective probability
distribution we would assign to its direction is spherically symmetric, but the thing
itself isn’t! The alpha particle itself, on this view, is already moving in some one
particular direction – we don’t know which one, but it is perfectly deﬁnite in reality
all the same. Seeing a ﬂash at some particular spot on the surrounding screen is then
not a big mystery and not a proof that the microscopic quantum dynamics is wrong...
it’s simply the way we ﬁnd out which direction the alpha particle was going all along.
In its simplest (or, one might say, most naive possible) form, this view might be
called the “ignorance interpretation of superposition”. I think it should be admitted
that it has a certain alluring reasonableness. Indeed, for some people reading this, it
may be the view that you have had in mind all along! By getting rid of any “quantum
fuzziness” at the root, down at the microscopic scale, the “ignorance interpretation
of superposition” totally pre-empts the difﬁculty, illustrated by Schrödinger’s cat, of

76
3
The Measurement Problem
amplifying the fuzziness up to a macroscopic scale where, apparently, it conﬂicts
with our direct experience of the world.
Notice also that the ignorance interpretation provides a beautifully simple reso-
lution of our earlier worries about the collapse postulate: if wave functions are not
really descriptions of the physical states of systems at all, but instead descriptions
of the state of our knowledge of those systems, then there is nothing remotely prob-
lematic about wave functions collapsing. The collapse is simply an updating of our
knowledge, when we get new data! So for example when we measure the energy of
the particle-in-the-box and its wave function collapses from ψ0 = c1ψ1+c2ψ2+c3ψ3
to, say, ψ2, this was not a dynamical process, a change in the physical state of the
particle, at all. The measurement simply reveals something that was there all along
but unknown to us. We simply learn the value of the particle’s energy, which we
did not know before, and so update ψ – our “knowledge catalog” – accordingly.
All the worries about inconsistent dynamical rules, and ambiguities about which
ones should apply when, and so on – all of these simply evaporate if we adopt the
ignorance interpretation.
This was essentially the view put forward by Max Born in 1926. Born’s view
morphed signiﬁcantly as it became bound up with the Copenhagen Interpretation
that we will discuss in Chap.6, but the original “Born interpretation” was nothing
but the ignorance interpretation we have discussed here. (See Sect.2.4 of Ref.[7] for
a nice overview.) And this view continued to enjoy support (from those who resisted
the Copenhagen orthodoxy) in subsequent decades. For example, in an essay written
in 1949, just a few years before his death in 1955, Einstein seemed to again advocate
something along these lines:
Within the framework of statistical quantum theory there is no such thing as a complete
description of the individual system. More cautiously it might be put as follows: The attempt
to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual
systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unneces-
sary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems
and not to individual systems. In that case the whole ‘egg-walking’ performed in order to
avoid the ‘physically real’ becomes superﬂuous. There exists, however, a simple psycho-
logical reason for the fact that this most nearly obvious interpretation is being shunned. For
if the statistical quantum theory does not pretend to describe the individual system (and its
development in time) completely, it appears unavoidable to look elsewhere for a complete
description of the individual system; in doing so it would be clear from the very beginning
that the elements of such a description are not contained within the conceptual scheme of the
statistical quantum theory. With this one would admit that, in principle, this scheme could
not serve as the basis of theoretical physics. Assuming the success of efforts to accomplish a
complete physical description, the statistical quantum theory would, within the framework of
future physics, take an approximately analogous position to the statistical mechanics within
the framework of classical mechanics. I am rather ﬁrmly convinced that the development of
theoretical physics will be of this type; but the path will be lengthy and difﬁcult [8, p. 671].
So this point of view not only seems quite sensible but also seems to have a strong
pedigree.
But, unfortunately, the ignorance interpretation – at least in its simplest form –
cannot possibly be right. It would seem to imply, for example, that in the double

3.4 Hidden Variables and the Ignorance Interpretation
77
slit experiment described in the last chapter, in the middle of which the particle’s
quantum state is a superposition of “going through slit 1” and “going through slit 2”
ψ =
1
√
2
[ψslit 1 + ψslit 2] ,
(3.32)
there is nevertheless some fact of the matter about which slit the particle really went
through: either slit 1 or slit 2. But if each particle is really just a literal particle
which has a perfectly deﬁnite (if sometimes unknown) position, it is (to understate
it) very difﬁcult to understand how the subsequent particle locations could form an
interference pattern. The interference pattern strongly – indeed, I think, conclusively
– establishes that the quantum wave function is really something physical, something
real, not just a description of our incomplete state of knowledge.
In addition, there are a number of rigorous mathematical theorems proving that
it is impossible to assign deﬁnite values to quantum properties in, at least, the naive
way suggested by the ignorance interpretation. Here we brieﬂy indicate the ﬂavor
of these so-called “no hidden variable theorems” with a simple example. (See the
Projects for two additional examples discussed already by Schrödinger in his 1935
paper.)
Consider the case of a single spin-1/2 particle whose spin might be measured
along the ˆz, ˆx, or ˆn directions (where ˆn is in the x −z plane and halfway between ˆx
and ˆz, i.e., 45◦away from both). The operators corresponding to the particle’s spin
along these three directions are
ˆσz =
 1
0
0 −1

,
(3.33)
ˆσx =

(3.34)
and
ˆσn =

√
2
 1
1
1 −1

=
1
√
2

ˆσx + ˆσz

.
(3.35)
Now if the particle has a deﬁnite spin along one of these directions (i.e., if its wave
function is an eigenstate of one of the three operators) it will be in a superposition of
“spin-up” and “spin-down” with respect to the other two directions. Thus, according
to the idea that the wave function provides a complete description of the physical
state of the particle, a particle can never possess a deﬁnite value of spin along all
three of these directions at once.
But, according to the ignorance interpretation of superposition, the fact that the
quantum state is a superposition does not mean that the particle doesn’t have a
deﬁnite value of spin. So we contemplate the possibility that particles have deﬁnite
spin values, sx, sy, and sn, along all three directions at once. These values would in
general not all be known at once, although presumably the idea is that a measurement

78
3
The Measurement Problem
of the corresponding quantity will simply reveal the value in question. Since (let’s
say) such measurements have outcomes +1 (meaning “spin-up”) or −1 (meaning
“spin-down”), we should assign either the value +1 or −1 to each of sx, sy, and sn.
Furthermore, there is some reason to expect that the values of the spin along these
three directions should obey the same mathematical relationships that are obeyed
by the corresponding operators: the quantum mechanical expectation values, for
example, will have this relationship, and it is plausible to suspect that, in the context
of a “hidden variable” theory like we are contemplating here, the average values
will have this relationship because each individual set of possible values has this
relationship. Equation(3.35) would then lead us to demand that
sn =
1
√
2

sx + sz

.
(3.36)
But it is immediately obvious that it will be mathematically impossible to assign
values +1 or −1 to sx, sz, and sn in accordance with Eq.(3.36): the quantity in
square brackets on the right will be −2, 0, or +2, and none of these, divided by
√
2
is +1 or −1.
The argument just sketched is closely related to the ﬁrst “no hidden variables”
proof, given by John von Neumann in 1932. Historically, von Neumann’s argu-
ment convinced many people that the type of ignorance interpretation favored by
Schrödinger and Einstein was untenable, and thus provided a nudge in the direction
of the Copenhagen interpretation (which we will study in greater depth in Chap.6).
As it turns out, though, von Neumann’s argument is rather impotent. This was ﬁrst
pointed out in 1935 by Grete Hermann, but her critique tragically failed to gain
any traction in the physics community. [7] Several decades later, John Stewart Bell
independently tackled the question of whether “hidden variable” theories had been
mathematically refuted; he would later describe von Neumann’s proof as “not merely
false but foolish!” [9].
The reason for this harsh assessment has to do with the requirement that the
“hidden variables” should obey the same mathematical relationships as their cor-
responding quantum mechanical operators – a requirement which perhaps makes
sense for commuting operators, but which is completely unmotivated for sets of
non-commuting operators like ˆσx, ˆσz, and ˆσn.
In more recent decades, “no hidden variables” proofs have been found whose
assumptions are somewhat more reasonable. Getting into the details here would
take us too far aﬁeld, but sufﬁce it to say it is seriously problematic to think that
one can understand all measurements as simply revealing the values of properties
that are, while unknown, perfectly deﬁnite and independent of the measurement
procedure itself. The naive ignorance interpretation, that is, is really not tenable.
(Crucial references here include Bell’s paper “On the problem of hidden variables
in quantum mechanics” [10] and Mermin’s review article [9].) As we will see in
Chap.7, however, there does exist a perfectly viable “hidden variable” theory with

3.4 Hidden Variables and the Ignorance Interpretation
79
a crucial property called “contextuality” (meaning, in a nutshell, that some but not
all measurements simply reveal the pre-existing values of properties) that allows it
to elude all of these impossibility theorems!
3.5
Wrap-Up
For now, let us try to recap, summarize, and package what we’ve seen in this Chapter.
It will probably be helpful, for example, to step back and try to get clear on the answer
to the following question:
What, exactly, is “the measurement problem”?
It is admittedly a little confusing, because this phrase is used to refer to several
inter-related things, all of which we have touched on here.
To begin with, sometimes “the measurement problem” refers to the fact that the
postulates of textbook quantum mechanics include statements about “measurements”
(andtheir outcomes), eventhough“measurement”is averyfuzzyandhumanconcept.
That is, it simply is not clear exactly which set of physical interactions or processes
in nature should count as “measurements”. And so, until or unless this is somehow
clariﬁed, it simply isn’t clear exactly what the theory is even saying. This is the
point Bell had in mind when he wrote that “[t]he concept of ‘measurement’ becomes
so fuzzy on reﬂection that it is quite surprising to have it appearing in physical
theory at the most fundamental level.” [11] Or, as he put it elsewhere – somewhat
less diplomatically – “conventional formulations of quantum theory, and of quantum
ﬁeld theory in particular, are unprofessionally vague and ambiguous” [12].
Then there is a closely-related, second, meaning to (or aspect of) “the measure-
ment problem”. Even if the notion of “measurement” were somehow given a clear
and precise meaning – even if, that is, a sharp boundary were somehow drawn
between “measurements” and “non-measurements” so that it became unambiguous
when to apply which part of the quantum formalism – there would still be something
unbelievable about the idea that there are these two fundamentally distinct types of
processes. Equivalently (since the difference between the two supposedly distinct
types of processes has to do with whether a microscopic system is, or is not, inter-
acting appropriately with something from the other, macroscopic, “realm”) there is
something unbelievable about the idea that the world is fundamentally “split” into
these two distinct “realms”. Surely a proper fundamental theory should describe the
entire universe in a coherent, uniﬁed way. And so, in this aspect, “the measurement
problem” refers to the failure of standard quantum theory to provide such a uniﬁed
description. Bell often remarked that quantum mechanics involved what he described
as a “shifty split”. For example:
There can be no question then of identifying the quantum system S with the whole world
W. There can be no question – without changing the axioms – of getting rid of the shifty
split. Sometimes some authors of ‘quantum measurement’ theories seem to be trying to do
just that. It is like a snake trying to swallow itself by the tail. It can be done – up to a point.

80

The Measurement Problem
But it becomes embarrassing for the spectators even before it becomes uncomfortable for
the snake [13].
And Schrödinger as well had already criticized the idea that “measurement” was
somehow a special, dynamically distinct kind of process, with its own special dynam-
ical rules. In quantum mechanics, he wrote,
any measurement suspends the law that otherwise governs continuous time-dependence of
the ψ-function and brings about in it a quite different change, not governed by any law
but rather dictated by the result of the measurement. But laws of nature differing from the
usual ones cannot apply during a measurement, for objectively viewed it is a natural process
like any other, and it cannot interrupt the orderly course of natural events. Since it does
interrupt that of the ψ-function, the latter ... can not serve ... as an experimentally veriﬁable
representation of an objective reality [3].
The idea that, “objectively viewed”, “measurement ... is a natural process like any
other” perfectly captures this second aspect of “the measurement problem.”
Andthen,ﬁnally,“themeasurementproblem”alsosometimesdenotesthetheory’s
apparent inability to provide sensible results when it is modiﬁed in the obvious way
in response to the criticisms of the previous paragraphs. This is the aspect that is illus-
trated by Schrödinger’s cat. If we refuse to accept the “fractured universe” implied
by the most straightforward reading of the quantum formalism, the easiest way to
try to solve that problem is to simply get rid of the postulates about “measurement”
(and the separately-presupposed classical “realm”) and retain just the microscopic
part of the theory. In this modiﬁed understanding of the theory, everything will be
described in terms of wave functions obeying Schrödinger’s equation always, and
so, to be sure, we have a coherent, uniﬁed worldview. But the problem – as we saw
– is that this worldview simply doesn’t seem to be right. Detection screens do not
“show a more or less constant uniform surface glow”, pointers on measuring devices
are never blurry, and cats are never observed to be “mixed or smeared out in equal
parts” of living and dead.
Sometimes this last aspect of “the measurement problem” is expressed by not-
ing that the theory does not seem to be able to explain the occurence of deﬁnite
measurement results. That is ﬁne as far as it goes, but it can also be confusing or
misleading. The full, original theory – with “collapse postulate” and all – certainly
has no difﬁculty explaining the occurrence of deﬁnite measurement results! Indeed,
they are right there in the postulates of that version of the theory! But that is precisely
the problem: those rules appear to have been implausibly put in by hand, to avoid
embarrassment, and (for the reasons I summarized in what I described as the ﬁrst two
aspects of “the measurement problem”) it seems impossible to take them seriously
as fundamental physical laws.
At the end of the day, the measurement problem is probably best understood
as the problem of understanding the seemingly paradoxical relation of the collapse
postulate to the rest of quantum theory. On the one hand, it seems impossible to
include the collapse postulate in the axioms of the theory and still regard the theory
as providing a fundamental account of the microscopic world. On the other hand, it
seems impossible to eliminate the collapse postulate from the dynamical axioms of

3.5 Wrap-Up
81
the theory, either by simply jettisoning it (and letting wave functions evolve according
to the Schrödinger equation all the time) or by interpreting it (and the wave function
generally) as pertaining not to reality itself but only to our knowledge of reality.
In later Chapters, we will explore some concrete proposals for resolving (or dis-
solving) the measurement problem. One of these – Everett’s “Many Worlds Inter-
pretation”, the subject of Chap.10 – attempts to retain the idea of the quantum
descriptions of reality (in terms of wave functions alone, obeying Schrödinger’s
equation always) being complete. Another – the “Pilot-Wave Theory” of de Broglie
and Bohm, the subject of Chap.7 – proposes to supplement the wave function with
additional (“hidden”) variables that resolve the dilemmas posed by Schrödinger,
but in a way that avoids the “no hidden variable” theorems discussed here. A third
proposal – the “Spontaneous Collapse” theory discussed in Chap.9 – attempts to
unify the Schrödinger equation and the collpase postulate to give a single uniform
dynamical description that can be applied coherently at all scales. And then there
is also a philosophical perspective – the “Copenhagen Interpretation” of Bohr and
Heisenberg, discussed in Chap.6 – that urges us to reject Schrödinger’s worries as
somehow baseless and meaningless.
Before turning to these proposals, however, we explore in the following two
Chapters two additional problems that seem to afﬂict textbook quantum theory.
Projects:
3.1 Show explicitly that Eq.(3.20) indeed satisﬁes the Schrödinger equation with
ˆH = ˆHint = λ ˆHx ˆpy.
3.2 Suppose, in our schematic formal treatment of the measurement of the energy
of a particle-in-a-box, we use the more complete Hamiltonian operator
ˆH = ˆHx + ˆHy + ˆHint
(3.37)
(with M ﬁnite so ˆHy cannot just be ignored). What now is the solution to the
Schrödinger equation with (x, y, 0) still given by Eq.(3.6)?
3.3 Sketch some conﬁguration space cartoons – in the style of Figs.2.10 and 2.11
– to illustrate the evolution of the wave function (for the particle-in-a-box +
pointer system) from Sect.3.2.
3.4 In Chap.2, we saw a simple example of measuring the momentum of a particle
whose wave function was ψ0(x) =
√
2 sin(kx). Set up a formal (purely micro-
scopic) quantum description of the measurement process: assume a “pointer”
degree of freedom y, which starts in a Gaussian state centered at y = 0.
What interaction Hamiltonian is appropriate for coupling the post-interaction
pointer position to the particle’s momentum? What is the ﬁnal quantum state
(x, y, T ) at the end of the interaction?
3.5 A particle is in the following superposition of position eigenstates:
ψ(x) =
1
√
2
[δ(x −a) + δ(x + a)]
(3.38)

82
3
The Measurement Problem
where the “δ”s are Dirac delta functions. The position of this particle is to be
measured by a position measuring apparatus (also described quantum mechan-
ically) whose pointer (with degree of freedom “y”) should indicate the par-
ticle’s position, x = +a or x = −a, by moving to the right or to the left,
respectively. What interaction Hamiltonian ˆHint will accomplish this? If the
interaction turns on at t = 0 (and any contributions to the total Hamiltonian
other than ˆHint are negligible) what is the wave function (x, y, t) at time
t? You should show explicitly that your answer is a solution of Schrödinger’s
equation. Finally, sketch/indicate the time-evolution of (x, y, t) in conﬁgu-
ration space.
3.6 Schrödinger says that “[i]nside the nucleus, blurring doesn’t bother us” [3].
Why not? Why is “blurring” a problem for macroscopic things like pointers,
but not a problem for microscopic things like nuclei?
3.7 Here is another simple “no hidden variables” argument that Schrödinger gives
in Ref.[3]. Suppose that a quantum mechanical particle actually has a deﬁnite
position ⃗r and a deﬁnite momentum ⃗p (even though these two quantities cannot
be simultaneously known). Then it will have an angular momentum of mag-
nitude |⃗L| = |⃗r × ⃗p|. Suppose that a measurement of the angular momentum
magnitude simply reveals this pre-existing value. Now note that, by varying
the origin with respect to which we measure the position, ⃗r – and therefore
also |⃗L| – can take on any value in a whole continuous spectrum. Explain how
this is inconsistent with the (quantized!) measurement outcomes for angular
momentum measurements, and therefore why the quantities ⃗r, ⃗p, and ⃗L can-
not possess pre-existing deﬁnite values (satisfying the relation ⃗L = ⃗r × ⃗p)
which are simply revealed by measurements.
3.8 Here is yet another simple “no hidden variables” argument from Ref.[3]. Con-
sider a quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator, with energy operator
(Hamiltonian) ˆH =
ˆp2
2m + 1
2mω2 ˆx2. Suppose the oscillator is in its ground state
with energy E = 1
2ℏω. The naive sort of “hidden variable” theory (associated
with the ignorance interpretation of superposition) would say that this state
describes an ensemble of individual systems, all with energy E, but different
values of x and p satisfying E =
p2
2m + 1
2mω2x2. Explain why this is not
straightforwardly possible. (Hint: if the assumption is that position measure-
ments simply reveal the actual pre-existing value of x, the Born rule implies
that arbitrarily large values of |x| are represented in the ensemble.)
3.9 One of the main ideas of this chapter is that there is no hope of introducing
a sharply deﬁned notion of dynamical collapse, such that the Schrödinger
evolution and the other kind of evolution each apply in their own well-deﬁned
and non-overlapping spheres. But there is one idea for sharply deﬁning such a
boundary; it was proposed (or at least considered) by Eugene Wigner (and is
perhaps somewhat widespread in more popular accounts of QM, for example
the weird movie “What the bleep do we know”). The idea is that wave function
collapse happens when physical matter interacts with mind. So, for example,
in the Schrödinger’s cat case, the wave function obeys the linear Schrödinger

3.5 Wrap-Up
83
equation when the radioactive atom is in the process of decaying, and when it
is interacting with the Geiger counter, which in turn interacts with the hammer
which interacts with the vial of poison which interacts with the cat ... all of this
ends up in the superposition described in the text ... until the moment some
human opens the box and becomes consciously aware of the result, at which
point the involvement of her mind (presumably, to be speciﬁc, the interaction
of her mind with her brain) collapses the wave function, for the whole physical
system up through and including the brain, down to one or the other of the
deﬁnite results. What do you think of this idea? Is it a good possible solution
to the measurement problem, or utter nonsense, or what? (See Wigner’s essay
“Remarks On the Mind-Body Question” [14].)
3.10 In his “Reply to criticisms” Einstein gives a nice one-particle version of a
Schrödinger’s Cat type argument:
If our concern is with macroscopic masses (billiard balls or stars), we are operating
with very short de Broglie waves, which are determinative for the behavior of the
center of gravity of such masses. This is the reason why it is possible to arrange the
quantum-theoretical description for a reasonable time in such a manner that for the
macroscopic way of viewing things, it becomes sufﬁciently precise in position as well
as in momentum. It is true also that this sharpness remains for a long time and that the
quasi-points thus represented behave just like the mass-points of classical mechanics.
However, the theory shows also that, after a sufﬁciently long time, the point-like char-
acter of the ψ-function is completely lost to the center of gravity-co-ordiantes, so that
one can no longer speak of any quasi-localisation of the centers of gravity. The picture
then becomes, for example in the case of a single macro-mass-point, quite similar to
that involved in a single free electron.
If now, in accordance with the orthodox position, I view the ψ-function as the complete
description of a real matter of fact for the individual case, I cannot but consider the
essentially unlimited lack of sharpness of the position of the (macroscopic) body as
real. On the other hand, however, we know that, by illuminating the body by means of
a lantern ... we get a (macroscopically judged) sharp determination of position. In order
to comprehend this I must assume that the sharply deﬁned position is determined not
merely by the real situation of the observed body, but also by the act of illumination.
This is again a paradox.... The spook disappears only if one relinquishes the orthodox
standpoint, according to which the ψ-function is accepted as a complete description of
the single system [8].
Work out some quantitative estimates of the time durations involved in this
kind of case. For example, consider the center-of-mass coordinate of a billiard
ball. Suppose, at t = 0, it is described quantum mechanically by a Gaussian
wave function of width one nanometer. How long would it take for the wave
function to spread to a width of order, say, a meter? How long would it take
the position of, say, a planet to become implausibly fuzzy?

esting that wasn’t already covered here.
3.12 In a Stern–Gerlach experiment, one can think of the position of the particle as
the “pointer” that indicates the outcome of the spin measurement. Suppose,
for example, a spin 1/2 particle begins in the product state

The Measurement Problem
0 = ψ+z φ(z)
(3.39)
where ψ+z is the spin eigenstate (“spin-up along the z-axis”) and φ(z) is a
Gaussian wave packet. (The z axis here is the one along which the Stern–
Gerlach apparatus has a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., the direction along
which the beam of incoming particles will be split.) What does the wave
function evolve into during the course of the experiment? Sketch a diagram.

diagram and discuss the relationship to the examples discussed in the Chapter.
(Could the role of the two properties be reversed? That is, could the spin be
considered as a pointer indicating the position along the z-axis? Discuss.)
3.13 In his essay “The Problem of Measurement” [15], Wigner discusses an exam-
ple that is now part of many introductory textbook explanations of spin: a beam
of particles (with, say, initial spin state ψ+x) is sent through a Stern–Gerlach
device to measure the z-spin. As discussed in the previous Project, this results
in two sub-beams that are spatially separated (transverse to the direction of
propagation of the particles). But now suppose some additional magnets are
added, which have the effect of re-combining the two beams. The recombined
beam is then sent through another Stern–Gerlach device, this time oriented in
the x-direction. (Draw a picture to keep track of all this!) If you think the parti-
cle’s passage through the z-oriented S-G device constitutes a measurement of
the particle’s z-spin, you would say that the particle’s wave function collapses
in this intermediate stage. Discuss what you would then expect to see in the
subsequent x-spin measurement. In fact, all particles in this kind of situation
are observed to emerge from the ﬁnal x-spin measurement as spin-up along
x. Discuss the implications of this and relate it to the other examples from the
Chapter.
3.14 A beam of spin-1/2 particles is sent through a Stern–Gerlach device aligned
along the x-axis. Those particles which emerge spin-up along the x-axis then
enter another Stern–Gerlach device aligned along the z-axis. What happens,
and how would an advocate of the ignorance interpretation explain the results?
Now suppose we allow particles emerging from the second S-G device as spin-
up along the z-axis to enter a third S-G device, oriented parallel to the x-axis.
What happens? Can an advocate of the ignorance interpretation explain these
results? How?
3.15 In Chap.2 I described – as something that should “kind of blow your mind” –
a two-particle entangled state in which neither particle has a deﬁnite energy,
but the two-particle system does have a deﬁnite total energy. The discussion
in Chap.3 should help you understand better exactly how one needs to be
understanding quantum descriptions in order for this kind of situation to be

3.5 Wrap-Up
85
interesting. Would this sort of entangled state be at all mind-blowing to some-
one who adopted the ignorance interpretation of superposition?
3.16 One difference between the Schrödinger evolution of the wave function, and
the collapse of the wave function, is that the former is deterministic while
the second is supposed to be irreducibly random. Sometimes it is claimed
that people (like Schrödinger and Einstein) who had problems with quantum
mechanics really just had problems with accepting irreducible randomness,
i.e., the failure of determinism. (Think here, for example, of Einstein’s famous
and oft-quoted remark “God does not play dice”.) To what extent do you think
it is accurate to say that the (supposed) “measurement problem” is really just
based on a philosophical insistence on pure determinism?

Chapter 4
The Locality Problem
Chapter3 focused on Schrödinger’s argument that quantum mechanical wave func-
tions (evolving always in accordance with Schrödinger’s own equation) cannot be
understood as providing complete descriptions of the physical states of individual
systems. In this chapter we focus on a second argument, due largely to Einstein,
for the same conclusion – namely, the incompleteness of the quantum mechanical
description of physical reality.
4.1
Einstein’s Boxes
In the discussion period of an important international scientiﬁc conference in 1927,
Einstein made what would turn out to be just the ﬁrst of several important and
related arguments purporting to prove that there is a contradiction between the idea
that quantum mechanics already provides (with wave functions alone) complete
descriptions of physical states, and the idea of “locality” that we reviewed in Chap.1.
In this early argument, Einstein begins by asking us to consider a single particle
(an electron, say) incident on a narrow slit, behind which there is a curved detection
screen as indicated in Fig.4.1. Behind the slit, the electron will diffract as we saw in
Chap.2, resulting in essentially spherical Schrödinger waves propagating toward the
screen. Of course, each individual electron that is ﬁred in will eventually be detected
at some distinct point on the screen. Einstein’s comments, which I quote here at
length, focus on the apparent conﬂict between the spreading spherical wave and the
distinct point of eventual detection.

One can take two positions towards the theory with respect to its postulated domain of
validity, which I wish to characterise with the aid of a simple example.
Let S be a screen provided with a small opening O [see Fig.4.1] and P a hemispherical
photographic ﬁlm of large radius. Electrons impinge on S in the direction of the arrow....
Some of these go through O, and because of the smallness of O and the speed of the particles,
are dispersed uniformly over the directions of the hemisphere, and act on the ﬁlm.
Both ways of conceiving the theory now have the following in common. There are de Broglie
waves, which impinge approximately normally on S and are diffracted at O. Behind S there
are spherical waves, which reach the screen P and whose intensity at P is responsible for
what happens at P.
We can now charaterise the two points of view as follows.
1. Conception I. – The de Broglie - Schrödinger waves do not correspond to a single electron,
buttoacloudofelectronsextendedinspace.Thetheorygivesnoinformationaboutindividual
processes, but only about the ensemble of an inﬁnity of elementary processes.
2. Conception II. – The theory claims to be a complete theory of individual processes. Each
particle directed towards the screen, as far as can be determined by its position and speed,
is described by a packet of de Broglie - Schrödinger waves of short wavelength and small
angular width. This wave packet is diffracted and, after diffraction, partly reaches the ﬁlm
P in a state of resolution.
According to the ﬁrst, purely statistical, point of view |ψ|2 expresses the probability that
there exists at the point considered a particular particle of the cloud, for example at a given
point on the screen.
According to the second, |ψ|2 expresses the probability that at a given instant the same
particle is present at a given point (for example on the screen). Here, the theory refers to an
individual process and claims to describe everything that is governed by laws.
Thesecondconceptiongoesfurtherthantheﬁrst,inthesensethatalltheinformationresulting
from I results also from the theory by virtue of II, but the converse is not true. It is only
by virtue of II that the theory contains the consequence that the conservation laws are valid
for the elementary process; it is only from II that the theory can derive the result of the
experiment of Geiger and Bothe, and can explain the fact that in the Wilson [cloud] chamber
the droplets stemming from an α-particle are situated very nearly on continuous lines.
But on the other hand, I have objections to make to conception II. The scattered wave
directed towards P does not show any privileged direction. If |ψ|2 were simply regarded as

4.1 Einstein’s Boxes
89
the probability that at a certain point a given particle is found at a given time, it could happen
that the same elementary process produces an action in two or several places on the screen.
But the interpretation, according to which |ψ|2 expresses the probability that this particle
is found at a given point, assumes an entirely peculiar mechanism of action at a distance,
which prevents the wave continuously distributed in space from producing an action in two
places on the screen.
In my opinion, one can remove this objection only in the following way, that one does not
describe the process solely by the Schrödinger wave, but that at the same time one localises
the particle during the propagation. I think Mr de Broglie is right to search in this direction.
If one works solely with the Schrödinger waves, interpretation II of |ψ|2 implies to my mind
a contradiction with the postulate of relativity [1].
Einstein’s “Conception 2” is of course just the idea that quantum wave functions
provide complete descriptions of the physical states of individual particles. If, on
this view, the wave function is spread out across some (hemispherical) region of
space, then the particle itself is literally smeared out across that region. (To use
Schrödinger’s phrase from the last Chapter, it is like a cloud or fog bank.)
The idea of “Conception 1”, on the other hand, is that the wave function does
not provide a complete description of an individual electron, but is instead a kind
of collective description of a large ensemble of individual electrons with differ-
ent individual properties. This is closely related to the “ignorance interpretation of
superposition” we discussed in the last chapter. The simplest (and probably wrong)
possibility along these lines is the idea that electrons really are like classical particles
which follow deﬁnite trajectories through space. If, for example, we sent a million
particles through, one at a time, they would each follow (say) some different path
between the slit and the screen, with |ψ(x)|2 representing the fraction of the million
trajectories that go near a given point x. The wave function thus provides us with
information about the probability for a given electron to be found somewhere, but
this smeared-out probabilistic information is certainly not able to tell us the exact
trajectory of any given particle.
Einstein acknowledges that certain empirical observations seem to support Con-
ception 2. But then he argues that Conception 2 conﬂicts with the principle of locality
– the point we want to focus on in this Chapter. The argument seems to be roughly as
follows. Suppose Conception 2 is correct, i.e., suppose that each individual particle
really is smeared out across the whole hemispherical region, with each part of the
cloud evidently possessing the power to perhaps trigger a “ﬂash” at the correspond-
ing point on the screen. But there is always only and exactly one ﬂash for a given
electron that is sent through. So it must be, on this view, that when a certain bit of
the cloud manages to trigger a “ﬂash” at a certain point on the screen, the rest of
the cloud instantaneously loses its potency. This is essentially just the idea that is
described formally in the collapse postulate: when a position measurement is made,
the wave function of the electron collapses to a position eigenstate (i.e., it goes to
zero at all points where the successful detection did not occur). Einstein is really just
pushing us to consider the implications of this if we take the wave function not just
as some kind of incomplete information catalog, but as a faithful and full description
of a kind of spread-out physical ﬁeld or cloud. An interaction between one part of

90

The Locality Problem
the cloud and a measuring device at the location of that one part can dramatically
change the structure – the “intensity” – of the cloud at distant locations.
But, Einstein argues, this conﬂicts with the principle of locality: as soon as the
“ﬂash” is triggered somewhere, the ﬁeld/cloud must suddenly change (“collapse”) at
other locations in order to ensure that no additional ﬂashes are produced elsewhere.
And note that the effect must be instantaneous. If, for example, the message to
other pieces of the cloud – saying something like “Urgent! A ﬂash has already been
produced elsewhere! So don’t make a ﬂash!” – propagated out at the speed of light,
there would be a chance that the message would arrive too late: a single electron might
thus sometimes produce two (or more) ﬂashes. Since this is never in fact observed
to occur, it must therefore be that – again assuming Interpretation 2 is correct – the
signal propagates out inﬁnitely fast. But this, of course, is supposed to be impossible
according to the idea of “locality” that is especially strongly implied by Einstein’s
own relativity theory.
And so, Einstein suggests, if the only two possibilities are Conception 1 and Con-
ception 2, we must adopt Conception 1 since Conception 2 contradicts the relativistic
notion of local causality, i.e., no-faster-than-light-action-at-a-distance.
Let us review a couple of other formulations of the same basic argument to make
sure its structure is clear.
Einstein gives a similar (but slightly simpler) example in a letter he wrote to
Schrödinger in 1935. He asks Schrödinger to consider a ball that is placed inside a
box into which a partition is then inserted, so that the ball is either on the left or on the
right. But suppose that we cannot see inside the box and things are arranged so that
it is impossible to tell which side the ball is in fact on. Suppose further that the two
halves of the box are then separated (again without looking inside or determining in
any other way which half contains the ball) and carried to distant locations, where
they are ﬁnally opened and their contents examined. As in his discussion at the 1927
Solvey Conference, Einstein suggests that there are two possible ways to understand
what is going on:
Now I describe a state of affairs as follows: the probability is 1/2 that the ball is in the ﬁrst
box. Is this a complete description?
NO: A complete description is: the ball is (or is not) in the ﬁrst box. That is how the
characterization of the state of affairs must appear in a complete description.
YES: Before I open them, the ball is by no means in one of the two boxes. Being in a deﬁnite
box only comes about when I lift the covers. This is what brings about the statistical character
of the world of experience, or its empirical lawfulness. Before lifting the covers the state
[of the distant box] is completely characterized by the number 1/2, whose signiﬁcance as
statistical ﬁndings, to be sure, is only attested to when carrying out observations [2, p. 69].
Note that the NO and YES alternatives map exactly onto Conception 1 and Con-
ception 2 from the 1927 discussion. According to the NO view (and Conception
1), the description of the state of the system in terms of probabilities is incomplete,
there being, in reality, an actual fact of the matter about the location of the particle.
According to the YES view (and Conception 2), the description in terms of proba-
bilities is complete because the actual fact of the matter regarding the location of the
ball (particle) only comes into existence with the act of measurement – the particle

4.1 Einstein’s Boxes

is, prior to observation, a kind of cloud that is in fact spread 50/50 between the two
half-boxes.
For the case of a literal (classical, macroscopic) ball, the YES view is not very
plausible, and Einstein asserts that “the man on the street would only take the [NO]
interpretation seriously.” But for a single electron, the YES view is essentially the
standard claim that quantum mechanics already provides a complete description of
physical states. Einstein didn’t accept this view and wanted to argue that the NO view
was the correct one not only for the classical particle but for the electron as well. He
constructs that argument, just as in 1927, by bringing in the idea of locality:
My way of thinking is now this: properly considered, one cannot [refute the completeness
doctrine, i.e., Conception 2, i.e., the YES view] if one does not make use of a supplementary
principle: the ‘separation principle.’ That is to say: ‘the second box, along with everything
having to do with its contents, is independent of what happens with regard to the ﬁrst box
(separated partial systems).’ If one adheres to the separation principle, then one thereby
excludes the [YES] point of view, and only the [NO] point of view remains, according to
which the above state description is an incomplete description of reality, or of the real states
[3].
The principle of locality, that is, seems to imply that we can ﬁnd out the contents
of the distant box, without physically affecting it (or its contents) at all, merely by
examining the contents of the nearby box. This seems to force on us the following
dilemma: either (i) the distant box already did or didn’t contain the particle (in
which case the earlier statement that there was a 50% probability of its being found
there is revealed as decidedly incomplete) – or (ii) the act of examining the contents
of the nearby box instantaneously affects the physical contents of the distant box
(changing it from a half-cloud with 50% potency to create a full-ﬂedged particle,
to either nothing or a full-ﬂedged particle). But this latter option indeed seems to
imply a violation of the relativistic notion of locality, i.e., seems to imply a kind of
instantaneous action-at-a-distance.
Heisenberg,interestingly,presentedaniceversionofEinstein’sargumentinwhich
he points out that it could be re-formulated in terms of a single photon that impinges
on a half-silvered mirror (see Fig.4.2):
...one other idealized experiment (due to Einstein) may be considered. We imagine a photon
which is represented by a wave packet built up out of Maxwell waves. It will thus have
a certain spatial extension and also a certain range of frequency. By reﬂection at a semi-
transparent mirror, it is possible to decompose it into two parts, a reﬂected and a transmitted
packet. There is then a deﬁnite probability for ﬁnding the photon either in one part or in the
other part of the divided wave packet. After a sufﬁcient time the two parts will be separated
by any distance desired; now if an experiment yields the result that the photon is, say, in the
reﬂected part of the packet, then the probability of ﬁnding the photon in the other part of
the packet immediately becomes zero. The experiment at the position of the reﬂected packet
thus exerts a kind of action (reduction of the wave packet) at the distant point occupied by
the transmitted packet, and one sees that this action is propagated with a velocity greater
than that of light [4, p. 39].
This is particularly interesting because Heisenberg – one of the creators and advo-
cates of the “orthodox completeness doctrine” – seems here to concede that Ein-
stein’s argument really does establish the nonlocality of quantum theory, at least if

Fig. 4.2 Heisenberg’s suggested setup for Einstein’s Boxes argument: a single photon (black) is
incident on a half-silvered mirror (i.e., a beam-splitter); a transmitted wave packet (dotted) contains
50% of the total probability for the particle to be detected, and a reﬂected packet (dashed) contains
the other 50% of the total probability. As Heisenberg writes, the detection of the particle “at the
position of the reﬂected packet thus exerts a kind of action (reduction of the wave packet) at the
distant point occupied by the transmitted packet, and one sees that this action is propagated with a
velocity greater than that of light [4]”
one assumes that it indeed provides complete descriptions of physical systems. But,
as he goes on to state, Heisenberg doesn’t believe that this implies any conﬂict with
relativity theory: “However, it is also obvious that this kind of action can never be
utilized for the transmission of signals so that it is not in conﬂict with the postulates
of the theory of relativity.” [4] It is surely correct that the nonlocality here cannot
be used for superluminal communication. But the idea that this makes it compati-
ble with relativity is quite dubious. Einstein, for example, obviously disagreed: he,
apparently, thought that relativity prohibited instantaneous-action-at-a-distance as
such, not merely that which can be somehow used by humans to build a telephone.
(The question of compatibility with relativity will arise in several later Chapters as
well. We set it aside here so as to focus on Einstein’s argument that the completeness
of the quantum mechanical description implies nonlocality... which Einstein, at least,
regarded as implying “a contradiction with the postulate of relativity” [1].)
Here, ﬁnally, is one last statement of the “Einstein’s Boxes” argument, this time
as formulated in 1964in a book by Louis de Broglie:
Suppose a particle is enclosed in a box B with impermeable walls. The associated wave 
is conﬁned to the box and cannot leave it. The usual interpretation asserts that the particle is
‘potentially’ present in the whole of the box B, with a probability ||2 at each point. Let us
suppose that by some process or other, for example, by inserting a partition into the box, the
box B is divided into two separate parts B1 and B2 and that B1 and B2 are then transported
to two very distant places, for example to Paris and Tokyo. The particle, which has not yet
appeared, thus remains potentially present in the assembly of the two boxes and its wave
function  consists of two parts, one of which, 1, is located in B1 and the other, 2, in B2.
The wave function is thus of the form  = c11 + c22, where |c1|2 + |c2|2 = 1.

4.1 Einstein’s Boxes
93
The probability laws of wave mechanics now tell us that if an experiment is carried out in
box B1 in Paris, which will enable the presence of the particle to be revealed in this box,
the probability of this experiment giving a positive result is |c1|2, whilst the probability of it
giving a negative result is |c2|2. According to the usual interpretation, this would have the
following signiﬁcance: because the particle is present in the assembly of the two boxes prior
to the observable localization, it would be immediately localized in box B1 in the case of
a positive result in Paris. This does not seem to me to be acceptable. The only reasonable
interpretation appears to me to be that prior to the observable localization in B1, we know
that the particle was in one of the two boxes B1 and B2, but we do not know in which one, and
the probabilities considered in the usual wave mechanics are the consequence of this partial
ignorance. If we show that the particle is in box B1, it implies simply that it was already there
prior to localization. Thus, we now return to the clear classical concept of probability, which
springs from our partial ignorance of the true situation. But, if this point of view is accepted,
the description of the particle given by the customary wave function , though leading to
a perfectly exact description of probabilities, does not give us a complete description of the
physical reality, because the particle must have been localized prior to the observation which
revealed it, and the wave function  gives no information about this.
We might note here how the usual interpretation leads to a paradox in the case of experiments
with a negative result. Suppose that the particle is charged, and that in the box B2 in Tokyo
a device has been installed which enables the whole of the charged particle located in the
box to be drained off and in so doing to establish an observable localization. Now, if nothing
is observed, this negative result will signify that the particles is not in box B2 and it is
thus in box B1 in Paris. But this can reasonably signify only one thing: the particle was
already in Paris in box B1 prior to the drainage experiment made in Tokyo in box B2. Every
other interpretation is absurd. How can we imagine that the simple fact of having observed
nothing in Tokyo has been able to promote the localization of the particle at a distance many
thousands of miles away? [5]
That is a very nice summary of the argument.
Now that we have (hopefully) made the “Einstein’s Boxes” argument fairly clear
in a qualitative way, let us try to make it a little more formally rigorous using Bell’s
formulation of “locality” from Chap.1. This is of course somewhat anachronistic in
the sense that Bell did not propose this deﬁnition of “locality” until 1976 (or, in its
ﬁnal version, 1990). So Einstein, for example, certainly never presented his argument
in exactly this form. Still, it will help us to understand exactly the structure of the
argument and the role of locality in particular.
The overall setup is illustrated in Fig.4.3. The event “A” refers to the examination
of the contents of the left half-box. If the particle is indeed found in the left half-
box, we will denote this A = +1, whereas if that box is found to be empty we will
denote this A = 0. Similarly, the events B = +1 and B = 0 will refer, respectively,
to the ﬁnding and not-ﬁnding of a particle in the right half-box when it is opened
and its contents are examined. In the Figure, the quantum mechanical wave function
ψ = ψL + ψR describing the state of the particle-in-the-boxes is depicted as the
dashed and dotted packets, each containing 50% of the total probability associated
with eventually ﬁnding the particle. (Note that here ψL and ψR are not separately
normalized. For example,

|ψL|2dx = 1/2.)
Now recall that Bell’s deﬁnition of locality requires us to compare the probabilities
assigned to an event like (for example) A = +1, when events from region B are,
and aren’t, conditioned upon. The deﬁnition also involves a complete speciﬁcation

Fig. 4.3 Space-time diagram of the “Einstein’s Boxes” setup. The events “A” and “B” represent
observations in which the half-boxes are opened and their contents examined. The dashed (ψL)
and dotted (ψR) curves represent the parts of the particle’s quantum mechanical wave function
(ψ = ψL + ψR) contained in the separated half-boxes. At the time corresponding to the horizontal
black line, this wave function ψ is supposed, according to orthodox quantum mechanics, to provide
a complete description of the state of the particle
of events C in a “slice”  across the backwards light cone of A. Here,  can just
be the intersection of the horizontal black line in the ﬁgure with the backwards light
cone of A. C then evidently includes (for the particle-in-the-box), the wave packet,
ψL, contained in the left half-box, as well as all of the physical details about the
left half-box itself, the transportation method, the observer and particle-detection
apparatus, etc. It is clear, though, that according to quantum theory, we can say, for
example, that even if all of these complicated details were speciﬁed, there would still
just be an irreducible 50% probability assigned to the event A = +1. That is:
P

A = +1 | C

(4.1)
However, consider now the event B – the examination of the contents of the right half-
box. The particle is either found there (B = +1) or not (B = 0). But in either case,
specifying the outcome of this other observation changes the probability assigned to
the event A = +1. For example:
P

A = +1 | C, B = +1

= 0.
(4.2)
That is, the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the left half-box given that it is found
in the right half-box is zero. And, similarly, the probability of ﬁnding the particle in
the left half-box given that it is not found in the right half-box is one:
P

A = +1 | C, B = 0

= 1.

So we have a clear violation of Bell’s locality condition,

Events from region B affect the probability assigned to A, even when the physical
state of a (properly situated) slice across the past light cone of A has been speciﬁed
(by assumption) completely.
What do we make of this? Basically it is just bringing out the fact that the collapse
of the wave function violates locality, if we take the wave function seriously as
representing a kind of physically-real ﬁeld. The collapse provides a mechanism
whereby one measurement (here, the examination of the contents of the right half-
box) inﬂuences the state of a distant system (here, the contents of the left half-box)
and thereby inﬂuences the probabilities assigned to events that are inﬂuenced by that
system (here, the examination of the contents of the left half-box).
We must be absolutely clear, though, that this in no way establishes the real
existence of nonlocal causal inﬂuences in nature! Instead, it merely establishes the
existence of nonlocal causal inﬂuences in a certain theory, namely, the version of
quantum theory according to which wave functions provide complete descriptions
of the physical states of microscopic systems. A crucial assumption in our analysis,
that is, was the assumption that the quantum mechanical wave function ψL provided
a complete speciﬁcation of the contents of the left half-box! We could – rather
obviously – avoid the violation of locality by considering instead a different theory,
according to which a complete speciﬁcation of the contents of the half-boxes – at the
time corresponding to the horizontal black line in the Figure – attributes the particle
deﬁnitely to one, or the other, of the half-boxes. This is precisely what Einstein
was suggesting when he said, at the end of his remarks in 1927, that one should “not
describe the process solely by the Schrödinger wave, but [should in addition localise]
the particle during the propagation.” [1]
What the Einstein’s boxes argument shows, then, is that we face a dilemma
between “locality” and “completeness”. If quantum mechanical wave functions pro-
vide complete descriptions of microscopic systems, then the theory must violate
locality in order to make correct statistical predictions. In short, completeness implies
thatthecollapseofthewavefunctionisaphysical,dynamicalprocess,whichconﬂicts
with relativistic locality. On the other hand, we could preserve locality by denying
the completeness doctrine and considering instead a hidden variable theory in which,
even when the wave function involves a superposition between the particle being in
the left and the right half-boxes, the particle is in fact (although unbeknownst to us)
already in one place or the other. (The pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and Bohm,
the subject of our Chap.7, is a hidden variable theory of just this sort.)

The Locality Problem
4.2
EPR
In 1935, Einstein co-authored with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen the most
famous criticism of the idea that quantum mechanical wave functions provide com-
plete descriptions of physical states. The argument of the EPR paper has the same
basic structure as that of the earlier and simpler “boxes” type argument: if quantum
mechanics is complete this would imply a violation of locality. Or equivalently: if we
believe in the principle of relativistic local causality, we must reject the completeness
doctrine.
It was discovered only rather recently that the entire text of the EPR paper – “Can
Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?”
[6] – was written by Podolsky (after conversations with Einstein and Rosen) and sent
in for publication before Einstein had even seen the manuscript. Einstein wrote, in a
private letter to Schrödinger, that the main point of the argument had not been made
very clear: “the essential thing is, so to speak, smothered by the formalism [2].” So
we should be a bit cautious about treating the EPR paper as providing an accurate
presentation of Einstein’s views. But the paper is so famous and so important that
we will review it rather carefully. The subsequent section then discusses some of
Einstein’s own later expressions of the same basic argument.
Here is the abstract of the EPR paper, which lays out the argument to be presented:
In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufﬁcient
condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty,
without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities
described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of
the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum
mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality.
Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of
measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the
result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description
of reality as given by a wave function is not complete [6].
The structure here is a bit convoluted, so let us delve in and try to understand it better.
The explanation of what it means for a theory to be “complete” seems clear
and uncontroversial. In the paper, EPR elaborate what they describe as a necessary
condition for calling a theory “complete”: “every element of the physical reality must
have a counterpart in the physical theory”. The overall goal of the paper will thus
be to establish the existence of more elements of reality than have counterparts in
quantum wave functions. In particular, the argument can be understood as an attempt
to establish that a single particle can have both a deﬁnite momentum and a deﬁnite
position, something that is forbidden in quantum mechanics since the position and
momentum operators do not commute. (This implies that there is no wave function
that is simultaneously an eigenstate of both position and momentum.)
In order to try to establish the existence of these properties, EPR require a “sufﬁ-
cient condition for the reality of a physical quantity”. As they elaborate in the main
text, this criterion is as follows:

4.2 EPR
97
If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability
equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality
corresponding to this physical quantity [6].
As we will discuss in Chap.6, this criterion became the focal point of Bohr’s attempt
to rebut the EPR argument. But it has always seemed perfectly valid to me. In any
case, it is a little hard to understand the idea, so let’s think it through with a simple
concrete example.
Suppose someone hands you a shoebox with a wine glass in it and you want
to determine whether the wine glass is shattered, or intact. One way of doing this
might be to shake the box vigorously and listen for the tinkling sound of shattered
pieces of glass hitting one another. But if the question is whether the glass in the
box was shattered originally, when the box was ﬁrst handed to you, this method
does not really work: the act of shaking the box may very well result in an originally
intact glass shattering! So hearing tinkling glass pieces inside would not effectively
establish that the glass had already been broken prior to your shaking. The shaking
itself may have brought that shattered state about.
By contrast, suppose (to complicate the scenario slightly) that the glass came to
be in the box by the following procedure. There were two glasses on the shelf; one
of them was perfectly intact, and one of them was already broken. Then your trusted
friend ﬂipped a coin and thereby randomly selected one of the glasses to seal up in the
box; suppose we are certain that he was extremely careful so that, if the intact glass
was the one selected for inclusion in the box, the glass was not broken during the act
of putting it in the box. The second glass is then left on the shelf and the cupboard
door is closed. Now in this situation, another method of determining the state of the
glass in the box presents itself: simply open the cupboard and see which glass is
there! If the intact glass is there in the cupboard, it must be the already-shattered
glass that is in the box, and vice versa. This way of determining the contents of the
box – in which we never interact directly with the box or its contents at all – ensures
that the determined state of the glass in the box faithfully represents the true original
state of the glass. We preclude the possibility that our act of determining the state
has somehow affected and changed the state. This is the basic scheme that EPR will
use to try to show that (in a certain special situation) a particle can be said to possess
simultaneously deﬁnite values of both position and momentum.
EPR thus consider the following situation. Suppose two particles have interacted
and gotten into an entangled state but then spatially separated so they are now far
apart from one another. See Fig.4.4. Assuming the particles are well-separated in
regard to their y coordinates, we then focus our attention on the degrees of freedom
x1 and x2. Suppose in particular that the particles are in the following entangled state:
(x1, x2) = δ(x1 −x2) =

δ(x1 −x)δ(x2 −x) dx
(4.6)
Pictured in the two-dimensional conﬁguration space, this state is a “ridge” along the
diagonal line x1 = x2. One can think of it as a superposition of states, over all possible
values of x, in which both particles are deﬁnitely located at position x. That is, the

Particle 2
Fig. 4.4 Two particles which have previously interacted are spatially separated but remain in an
entangled state. In particular, the spatial degrees of freedom x1 and x2 are entangled. We assume
that, say, the part of the quantum state associated with the y coordinates is a simple product of two
well-separated wave packets, centered (say) at y1 = 0 and y2 = 0 for the coordinate systems shown
here. (Note that we use distinct coordinate systems for the two particles such that, for example,
y1 = 0 and y2 = 0 are perhaps a million miles apart from one another!) So the particles are entangled
(in so far as their positions along x are concerned) but they are unambiguously well-separated in
space in regard to their y positions
state does not attribute a deﬁnite position to particle 1 or to particle 2 – both particles
are maximally smeared out. But they are smeared out in a perfectly correlated way:
measurement of the position x1 of particle 1 immediately tells us the position x2 of
particle 2 because (even though neither x1 nor x2 has a well-deﬁned value prior to
such measurements) x1 and x2 are deﬁnitely equal to one another.
But this means it is possible to determine the position of particle 2 indirectly –
without disturbing the physical state of particle 2 at all – by measuring the position
x1 of its distant entangled partner. And so, by the reality criterion, it follows that the
distant particle must already have a deﬁnite position even when no such position is
attributed to it by the pre-measurement wave function, Eq.(4.6). And note that this is
already sufﬁcient to show that that pre-measurement wave function did not provide
a complete description of the state of the two particles: particle 2 has a deﬁnite
position, but the wave function doesn’t tell us about this at all.
EPR, however, go farther. The two-particle wave function can be re-written in this
alternative (but mathematically equivalent) form
(x1, x2) = δ(x1 −x2) = 1
2π

eik(x1−x2) dk =
1
2π

eikx1e−ikx2 dk.
(4.7)
The last expression can be understood as saying that the state is a superposition –
over all possible values of k – of states in which particle 1 has momentum p1 = ℏk
and particle 2 has momentum p2 = −ℏk. So the state can also, alternatively, be
understood as a state in which neither particle has any deﬁnite momentum value, but
the momenta of the two particles are perfectly (anti-) correlated: p1 = −p2.

4.2 EPR
99
But this means it is possible to determine the momentum of particle 2 indirectly –
without disturbing it at all – by measuring the momentum p1 of its distant entangled
partner. And so, by the reality criterion, it follows that the distant particle must already
have a deﬁnite momentum even when no such momentum is attributed to it by the
pre-measurement wave function. It is, in short, the same story again with momentum
as it was before with position. So in addition to possessing a deﬁnite position (about
which the pre-measurement wave function was silent), particle 2 apparently also
possesses a deﬁnite momentum (about which the pre-measurement wave function
was also silent). So that wave function provides, at best, a decidedly – a doubly –
incomplete description of the state of the particle. There are at least these two physical
properties, position and momentum, which in reality have sharp well-deﬁned values,
for which there is no corresponding element in the theoretical description. And in a
way it’s even worse than that, for by establishing the real existence of both position
and momentum (for the one distant particle) EPR show not only that the particular
wave function in Eq.(4.6) fails to provide a complete description, but that no wave
function possibly could provide a complete description. For there is, simply, no such
thing as a wave function that is simultaneously a position and momentum eigenstate.
That is the essential argument. But I have explained it here in my own words,
and my version doesn’t appear to correspond perfectly to the logical structure of
the EPR paper’s abstract. Let us try to understand that. First of all, what should we
make of this disjunction (from the paper’s abstract), “that either (1) the quantum-
mechanical description of reality given by the wave function is not complete or (2)
when the operators corresponding to two physical quantities do not commute the
two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality”? This sounds very complicated but
is actually quite trivial. Suppose two operators (for example position and momen-
tum) fail to commute. Clearly, either the corresponding physical properties (1) can
have simultaneous reality, or (2) cannot have simultaneous reality. If they can, then
quantum mechanics is necessarily incomplete, because there is no wave function that
is simultaneously an eigenstate for (i.e., there is no wave function that simultane-
ously attributes deﬁnite real values to) the two properties in question. So the trivial
disjunction I wrote two sentences back is equivalent to the one from the EPR text.
Now, in the paper, EPR continue the argument as follows. Having established the
disjunction between (1) and (2) just discussed, they write:
Starting then with the assumption that the wave function does give a complete description of
the physical reality, we arrived at the conclusion that two physical quantities, with noncom-
muting operators, can have simultaneous reality. Thus the negation of (1) leads to the negation
of the only other alternative (2). We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical
description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete.
Where and what, exactly, is the argument described in the ﬁrst sentence here? It is
again somewhat obscure and confusing, but actually this is just the essential argument
we reviewed before. The way it is presented in the text is along the following lines.
Thinking of the state as  =

δ(x1−x)δ(x2−x) dx it is obvious that, if we measure
the position of particle 1 and ﬁnd it, say, at x1 = X, the state of the two-particle system
collapses to δ(x1 −X)δ(x2 −X) which (being a product state) implies that we can

100
4
The Locality Problem
attribute the following wave function to particle 2:
ψ2 = δ(x2 −X).
(4.8)
On the other hand, thinking of the (2-particle pre-measurement) state as  =
1
2π

eikx1e−ikx2 dk it is obvious that, if we measure the momentum of particle 1 and
ﬁnd, say, p1 = P, the state of the two-particle system collapses to 1
2π ei Px1/ℏe−i Px2/ℏ
which (being a product state) implies that we can attribute the following wave func-
tion to particle 2:
ψ2 = ei(−P/ℏ)x2.
(4.9)
EPR write: “Thus, it is possible to assign two different wave functions ... to the same
reality (the second system after the interaction with the ﬁrst).”
But then, assuming that wave functions provide a complete description of the state
of the particle, i.e., assuming the negation of statement (1) from before, we have –
from Eq.(4.8) – that particle 2 has a deﬁnite position, and – from Eq.(4.9) – that
particle 2 has a deﬁnite momentum. Which indeed contradicts statement (2) from
before.
Thus, the way it is presented in the actual EPR paper, the argument has the
following extremely convoluted structure: either (1) or (2), but denying (1) requires
one to also deny (2), and so one cannot consistently deny (1); that is, one must accept
(1). That is, to be sure, logically valid. But it is also needlessly convoluted. The heart
of the argument is simply the idea that, for spatially-separated but appropriately-
entanged pairs of particles, we can determine, with certainty, the value of some
property of one of the particles without actually messing with it at all, but by instead
messing with its entangled partner and using the correlations built into the entangled
state to infer something about the undisturbed particle. It is just like the example
of the wine glass in the box. No wonder Einstein thought Podolsky’s version of the
argument was unnecessarily confusing!
4.3
Einstein’s Discussions of EPR
I mentionedinthelast sectionthat althoughthepaper grewout of discussions between
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, Podolsky actually wrote the EPR paper and submit-
ted it for publication before Einstein had had a chance to see it or comment. And
Einstein was somewhat frustrated and disappointed with how it came out. We began
to see in the last section how Podolsky’s version of the argument seemed needlessly
convoluted, and undoubtedly that is part of what frustrated Einstein. But Einstein
also speciﬁcally remarked that the main point had been “smothered”. What was this
main point that got buried in Podolsky’s write-up?
Almost certainly it was the concept of “locality” which, as we have already seen in
the discussion of the simpler “boxes” type arguments, was quite central to Einstein’s

4.3 Einstein’s Discussions of EPR
101
thinking about this kind of situation, but which hardly appears explicitly in the EPR
paper itself. It is, though, implied in the application of the “reality criterion”. Why
do we think that, if we only make an actual measurement on particle 1, particle 2 is
not disturbed at all? Well, evidently, because the two particles are spatially separated
– they are distant from one another – and surely nothing we do here can have an
immediate effect over there. That, presumably, is the idea – that is, it is only if we
make the locality assumption that we are entitled to actually apply the reality criterion
in the case at hand. But this is not made very clear. The closest we come, in the actual
EPR paper, to an explicit mention of “locality” is in the penultimate paragraph of the
paper:
One could object to this conclusion [that quantum mechanics is incomplete] on the grounds
that our criterion of reality is not sufﬁciently restrictive. Indeed, one would not arrive at our
conclusion if one insisted that two or more physical quantities can be regarded as simulta-
neous elements of reality only when they can be simultaneously measured or predicted. On
this point of view, since either one or the other, but not both simultaneously, of the quantities
[momentum and position of particle 2] can be predicted, they are not simultaneously real.
This makes the reality of [particle 2’s momentum and position] depend upon the process of
measurement carried out on the ﬁrst system, which does not disturb the second system in
any way. No reasonable deﬁnition of reality could be expected to permit this [6].
Here EPR seem to be anticipating the objection that, as we will see, Bohr makes
against their argument: you cannot measure both the position and the momentum of
the nearby particle, so you cannot determine both of these properties for the distant
particle. You can only do one or the other. I think EPR are right to point out that
this objection would make the real state of particle 2 “depend [nonlocally!] upon the
process of measurement carried out on the ﬁrst system.” It doesn’t matter whether
you do in fact determine the position or momentum of particle 2 by measuring the
corresponding property of particle 1; the mere fact that you could do so implies that
those distant properties exist. Locality implies that the state of the distant particle is
unaffected by what happens here – even the choice of whether or not to in fact go
ahead with a certain kind of measurement.
So, I think, EPR here make a good and valid point, but it remains unfortunate
that this is practically the only place they stress the notion of locality. As mentioned
earlier, establishing the incompleteness of quantum mechanical descriptions doesn’t
even require establishing that the distant particle has both a deﬁnite position and a
deﬁnite momentum. Its merely possessing, say, a deﬁnite position – when its state is
described by the entangled wave function, Eq.(4.6) – is completely sufﬁcient. And
the point is, locality plays a crucial role already in the argument that a single such
property, for the distant particle, can be established. Podolsky should have made all
of this clearer.
Anyway, to round out our understanding of the EPR argument, we consider ﬁnally
some of Einstein’s own commentaries on the argument and related issues.
To begin with, in the same 1935 letter to Schrödinger from which I earlier quoted
his remarks about the “boxes” example, Einstein writes:
The preceding [boxes] analogy corresponds only very imperfectly to the quantum mechanical
example in the [EPR] paper. It is, however, designed to make clear the point of view that

102
4
The Locality Problem
is essential to me. In quantum mechanics one describes a real state of affairs of a system
by means of a normed function ψ of the coordinates (of conﬁguration space). The temporal
evolution is uniquely determined by the Schrödinger equation. One would now very much
like to say the following: ψ stands in a one-to-one correspondence with the real state of
the real system. The statistical character of measurement outcomes is exclusively due to the
measuring apparatus, or the process of measurement. If this works, I talk about a complete
description of reality by the theory. However, if such an interpretation doesn’t work out, then
I call the theoretical description ‘incomplete’.... [2, p. 71]
Einstein continues:
Now what is essential is exclusively that [the wave functions, relating to the distant particle,
that arise from different kinds of measurements on the nearby particle] are in general different
from one another. I assert that this difference is incompatible with the hypothesis that the
ψ description is correlated one-to-one with the physical reality (the real state). After the
[particles separate], the real state of [the two particle system] consists precisely of the real
state of [particle 1] and the real state of [particle 2], which two states have nothing to do with
one another. The real state of [particle 2] thus cannot depend upon the kind of measurement
I carry out on [particle 1]. (‘Separation hypothesis’ from above.) But then for the same
state of [particle 2] there are two (in general arbitrarily many) equally justiﬁed ψ[2], which
contradicts the hypothesis of a one-to-one or complete description of the real states [3].
This passage has the virtue of making clearer the exact sense in which Einstein
understood the “incompleteness” of the quantum mechanical description: a failure
of the one-to-one correspondence between real states and theoretical descriptions.
In his auto-biographical contribution to the collection Albert Einstein: Philoso-
pher Scientist from 1949, Einstein also gave an extensive discussion of the EPR-type
argument for quantum incompleteness. We quote it at length here:
Physics is an attempt conceptually to grasp reality as it is thought independently of its being
observed. In this sense one speaks of ‘physical reality’. In pre-quantum physics there was
no doubt as to how this was to be understood. In Newton’s theory reality was determined by
a material point in space and time; in Maxwell’s theory, by the ﬁeld in space and time. In
quantum mechanics it is not so easily seen. If one asks: does a ψ-function of the quantum
theory represent a real factual situation in the same sense in which this is the case of a material
system of points or of an electromagnetic ﬁeld, one hesitates to reply with a simple ‘yes’ or
‘no’; why? What the ψ-function (at a deﬁnite time) asserts, is this: What is the probability
for ﬁnding a deﬁnite physical magnitude q (or p) in a deﬁnitely given interval, if I measure it
at time t? The probability is here to be viewed as an empirically determinable, and therefore
certainly as a ‘real’ quantity which I may determine if I create the same ψ-function very
often and perform a q-measurement each time. But what about the single measured value
of q? Did the respective individual system have this q-value even before the measurement?
To this question there is no deﬁnite answer within the framework of the [existing] theory,
since the measurement is a process which implies a ﬁnite disturbance of the system from the
outside; it would therefore be thinkable that the system obtains a deﬁnite numerical value for
q (or p), the measured numerical value, only through the measurement itself. For the further
discussion I shall assume two physicists, A and B, who represent a different conception with
reference to the real situation as described by the ψ-function.
A. The individual system (before the measurement) has a deﬁnite value of q (i.e., p) for
all variables of the system, and more speciﬁcally, that value which is determined by a
measurement of this variable. Proceeding from this conception, he will state: The ψ-function
is no exhaustive description of the real situation of the system but an incomplete description;
it expresses only what we know on the basis of former measurements concerning the system.

4.3 Einstein’s Discussions of EPR
103
B. The individual system (before the measurement) has no deﬁnite value of q (i.e., p). The
value of the measurement only arises in cooperation with the unique probability which is
given to it in view of the ψ-function only through the act of measurement itself. Proceeding
from this conception, he will (or, at least, he may) state: the ψ-function is an exhaustive
description of the real situation of the system.
We now present to these two physicists the following instance: There is to be a system which
at the time t of our observation consists of two partial systems S1 and S2, which at this
time are spatially separated and (in the sense of the classical physics) are without signiﬁcant
reciprocity. The total system is to be completely described through a known ψ-function ψ12
in the sense of quantum mechanics. All quantum theoreticians now agree upon the following:
If I make a complete measurement of S1, I get from the results of the measurement and from
ψ12 an entirely deﬁnite ψ function ψ2 of the system S2. The character of ψ2 then depends
upon what kind of measurement I undertake on S1.
Now it appears to me that one may speak of the real factual situation of the partial system S2.
Of this real factual situation, we know to begin with, before the measurement of S1, even less
than we know of a system described by the ψ-function. But on one supposition we should,
in my opinion, absolutely hold fast: the real factual situation of the system S2 is independent
of what is done with the system S1, which is spatially separated from the former. According
to the type of measurement which I make of S1, I get, however, a very different ψ2 for the
second partial system.... Now, however, the real situation of S2 must be independent of what
happens to S1. For the same real situation of S2 it is possible therefore to ﬁnd, according
to one’s choice, different types of ψ-function. (One can escape from this conclusion only
by either assuming that the measurement of S1 (telepathically) changes the real situation of
S2 or by denying independent real situations as such to things which are spatially separated
from each other. Both alternatives appear to me entirely unacceptable.)
If now the physicists, A and B, accept this consideration as valid, then B will have to give up
his position that the ψ-function constitutes a complete description of a real factual situation.
For in this case it would be impossible that two different types of ψ-functions could be
co-ordinated with the identical factual situation of S2.
The statistical character of the present theory would then have to be a necessary consequence
of the incompleteness of the description of the systems in quantum mechanics, and there
would no longer exist any ground for the supposition that a future basis of physics must be
based upon statistics [7].
This passage, I think, makes very clear: (i) Einstein’s belief that the randomness
of quantum mechanics is in fact not inherent to nature, but is instead a result of
the incompleteness of the theory’s descriptions of nature; (ii) his hope that a future
theory might complete the quantum descriptions and thereby restore the principle
of determinism to physical theory; and (iii) his reasons, based in particular on the
locality principle to which he stresses we must “absolutely hold fast”, for this belief
and this hope.
I want to stress, in particular, that Einstein’s belief that a proper theory would
restore determinism – captured in his oft-quoted remark “God does not play dice” –
was in no way based on a philosophical unwillingness to contemplate fundamental,
irreducible randomness. Instead it was based on his argument that consistency with
relativistic locality required one to reject the claim that quantum mechanical wave
functions provide complete descriptions of the physical states of the systems they
describe.

104

The Locality Problem
Einstein gave another, much briefer, summary of his position in his other contri-
bution (called “Reply to Criticisms”) to the same 1949 book:
By this way of looking at the matter it becomes evident that the paradox forces us to relinquish
one of the following two assertions:
1. the description by means of the ψ-function is complete.
2. the real states of spatially separated objects are independent of each other.
On the other hand, it is possible to adhere to (2) if one regards the ψ-function as the description
of a (statistical) ensemble of systems (and therefore relinquishes (1)). However, this view
blasts the framework of the ‘orthodox quantum theory’ [8].
In that same essay, Einstein states: “I am, in fact, ﬁrmly convinced that the essentially
statistical character of contemporary quantum theory is solely to be ascribed to the
fact that this [theory] operates with an incomplete description of physical systems.”
[8]
Inthissection,Ihavetriedtostressthat,forEinstein,establishingtherealexistence
of (for example) both the position and the momentum of a distant particle (by making
one or the other measurement on the nearby particle) was not really necessary to
establish the incompleteness of the quantum mechanical descriptions of states. (He
wrote to Schrödinger that whether the EPR argument establishes the reality of, for
example, both position and momentum “ist mir wurst” – roughly, “I couldn’t care
less!” [2]) Instead, his preferred argument merely pointed out that one’s choice of
measurements to make on the nearby particle produced (via wave function collapse)
different wave functions for the distant particle; and so, if the actual state of that
distant particle remains unaffected by such measurements on the nearby particle, we
have a failure of completeness in the sense of one-to-one correspondence between
wave functions and physical states.
But I also don’t want to make it appear that Einstein’s views were totally different
from those presented in our summary of the EPR paper itself. Indeed, it seems that
– although he did not think this was necessary to establish the conﬂict between
locality and completeness – Einstein did accept that the EPR-type argument does
establish that, if locality is true, the distant system must already possess (for example)
both position and momentum. For example, in a 1938 letter to Tanya Ehrenfest,
Einstein wrote “Here, however, I [cannot] reconcile myself to the following, that a
manipulation undertaken on A has an inﬂuence on B; thus I see myself required to
suppose, as actually or physically realized at B, everything relating to measurement
outcomes on B that can be predicted with certainty, on the basis of some measurement
or other undertaken on A.” [2, p. 63]

Bohm’s Reformulation
In 1951, the young physicist David Bohm published a textbook on quantum theory.
The book is somewhat unusual in emphasizing conceptual questions and containing
lengthy prose discussions (in addition to the more standard mathematical presenta-

tion). The book is also of interest because it treats the subject in a very orthodox,
Copenhagen way; but shortly after its publication, Bohm met with Einstein, who
evidently convinced Bohm of the inadequacy of this approach (and in particular
convinced him of the “incompleteness” of the orthodox quantum state descriptions).
And in the following year, 1952, Bohm would produce (or really, because similar
ideas had been proposed, but then prematurely abandoned, 25 years earlier by de
Broglie, reproduce) a fully-worked-out “hidden variable theory” that we will discuss
in depth in Chap.7.
For our present purposes, though, we want to focus on Bohm’s 1951 presentation
of “The Paradox of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen” which marks an important (if
also seemingly minor and merely technical) advance that would play an important
role in Bell’s Theorem, the subject of our Chap.8.
Here is Bohm’s lead-in to the discussion:
What the authors [of EPR] wished to do with their criteria for reality was to show that the
above interpretation of the present quantum theory is untenable and that the wave func-
tion cannot possibly contain a complete description of all physically signiﬁcant factors (or
‘elements of reality’) existing within a system. If their contention could be proved, then one
would be led to search for a more complete theory, perhaps containing something like hidden
variables, in terms of which the present quantum theory would be a limiting case [9, p. 612].
And then here is Bohm’s presentation of the EPR argument, re-framed in terms of
the spins of a pair of spin 1/2 particles:
We have modiﬁed the experiment somewhat [compared to the way it was presented in the
actual EPR paper], but the form is conceptually equivalent to that suggested by them, and
considerably easier to treat mathematically.
Suppose that we have a molecule containing two atoms in a state in which the total spin is
zero and that the spin of each atom is ℏ/2. Roughly speaking, this means that the spin of
each particle points in a direction exactly opposite to that of the other, insofar as the spin may
be said to have any deﬁnite direction at all. Now suppose that the molecule is disintegrated
by some process that does not change the total angular momentum. The two atoms will
begin to separate and will soon cease to interact appreciably. Their combined spin angular
momentum, however, remains equal to zero, because by hypothesis, no torques have acted
on the system.
Now, if the spin were a classical angular momentum variable, the interpretation of this
process would be as follows: While the two atoms were together in the form of a molecule,
each component of the angular momentum of each atom would have a deﬁnite value that
was always opposite to that of the other, thus making the total angular momentum equal
to zero. When the atoms separated, each atom would continue to have every component of
its spin angular momentum opposite to that of the other. The two spin-angular-momentum
vectors would therefore be correlated. These correlations were originally produced when the
atoms interacted in such a way as to form a molecule of zero total spin, but after the atoms
separate, the correlations are maintained by the deterministic equations of motion of each
spin vector separately, which bring about conservation of each component of the separate
spin-angular-momentum vectors.
Suppose now that one measures the spin angular momentum of any one of the particles,
say No. 1. Because of the existence of correlations, one can immediately conclude that the
angular-momentum vector of the other particle (No. 2) is equal and opposite to that of No. 1.
In this way, one can measure the angular momentum of particle No. 2 indirectly by measuring
the corresponding vector of particle No. 1.

The Locality Problem
Let us now consider how this experiment is to be described in the quantum theory. Here, the
investigator can measure either the x, y, or z component of the spin of particle No. 1, but not
more than one of these components, in any one experiment. Nevertheless, it still turns out
as we shall see that whichever component is measured, the results are correlated, so that if
the same component of the spin of atom No. 2 is measured, it will always turn out to have
the opposite value. This means that a measurement of any component of the spin of atom
No. 1 provides, as in classical theory, an indirect measurement of the same component of
the spin of atom No. 2. Since, by hypothesis, the two particles no longer interact, we have
obtained a way of measuring an arbitrary component of the spin of particle No. 2 without
in any way disturbing that particle. If we accept the deﬁnition of an element of reality ...
suggested by ERP, it is clear that after we have measured σz for particle 1, then σz for
particle 2 must be regarded as an element of reality, existing separately in particle No. 2
alone. If this is true, however, this element of reality must have existed in particle No. 2 even
before the measurement of σz for particle No. 1 took place. For since there is no interaction
with particle No. 2, the process of measurement cannot have affected this particle in any
way. But now let us remember that, in each case, the observer is always free to reorient the
apparatus in an arbitrary direction while the atoms are still in ﬂight, and thus to obtain a
deﬁnite (but unpredictable) value of the spin component in any direction that he chooses.
Since this can be accomplished without in any way disturbing the second atom, we conclude
that ... precisely deﬁned elements of reality must exist in the second atom, corresponding to
the simultaneous deﬁnition of all three components of its spin. Because the wave function
can specify, at most, only one of these components at a time with complete precision, we are
then led to the conclusion that the wave function does not provide a complete description of
all elements of reality existing in the second atom.
If this conclusion were valid, then we should have to look for a new theory in terms of which
a more nearly complete description was possible [9].
As mentioned, Bohm himself became convinced of the need for such a “new theory”
– and indeed produced one! – in the following year. But at the time of this writing
he continued to accept the Copenhagen philosophy, according to which the EPR
argument is not valid. We will review the Copenhagen philosophy (and in particular
Bohr’s reply to the EPR argument) in Chap.6.
For now, let’s just focus on the technical aspects of Bohm’s reformulation of the
EPR scenario in terms of the spins of two spin 1/2 particles. Using the notation of
Chap.2, in which for example “ψ1
+z” denotes a state in which particle 1 is “spin up”
along the z-direction, the state of total spin zero described by Bohm is the following:
 =
1
√
2

ψ1
+zψ2
−z −ψ1
−zψ2
+z

.
(4.10)
This is a superposition of (one the one hand) a state in which particle 1 is “spin
up” along z and particle 2 is “spin down” along z and (on the other hand) a state in
which particle 1 is “spin down” and particle 2 is “spin up”. The minus sign (i.e., the
relative phase between the two terms in the superposition) turns out to be important.
The qualitatively similar superposition with a “+” sign is also a state in which the
z-component of the total spin is zero, but (unlike the state with the minus sign) the
magnitude (squared) of the total spin is not zero. Indeed, this other state – with the
“+” sign – naturally goes together with the “both particles are spin up” and “both
particles are spin down” states to form a so-called triplet of states (with one unit of

4.4 Bohm’s Reformulation
107
total spin angular momentum, but with the z-component being −1, 0, and +1 in the
three states).
By contrast, the state in Eq.(4.10) is sometimes called the singlet state because
it alone has zero units of total spin angular momentum – and therefore zero for its
z-component and indeed also all other components. I will leave the exploration of
some of the mathematical aspects of this state for you to work through in the Projects.
But it should be clear, at least, that this EPR-Bohm state allows a simpliﬁed
version of an EPR-type argument in the following way. The state in Eq.(4.10) is
not an eigenstate of σz for particle 2. It is instead an entangled superposition of two
states in which σz for particle 2 has two distinct values (+1 and −1). So according
to the usual completeness doctrine, particle 2 has no deﬁnite value of σz when the
state of the two particles is given by Eq.(4.10). However, by measuring σz of particle
1, we can determine – seemingly without disturbing particle 2in any way – σz for
particle 2: if particle 1 turns out to be spin-up, then particle 2 is spin-down, and vice
versa. After such a measurement on particle 1, it thus seems clear that particle 2 has
a deﬁnite z-spin. Then, either it had that deﬁnite z-spin value all along – in which
case the quantum mechanical state description of Eq.(4.10) is revealed as having
been incomplete – or its z-spin value only crystallized, from some earlier “blurry”
state, as a result of the measurement on particle 1. But this latter possibility involves
a kind of “spooky action-at-a-distance”, i.e., a violation of local causality. We thus
have to either accept the non-locality (and face the seemingly daunting task of trying
to reconcile it with relativity) or abandon the completeness doctrine.
4.5
Bell’s Re-Telling
John Bell – whose seminal 1964 theorem will be the subject of Chap.8 – wrote
extensively on the foundations of quantum theory and the EPR argument in particular.
One of his presentations in particular is so amusing and beautiful and clear that I
cannot help but include it here. It is from a paper with the intriguing title “Bertlmann’s
socks and the nature of reality”. The paper begins:
The philosopher on the street, who has not suffered a course in quantum mechanics, is quite
unimpressed by Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen correlations. He can point to many examples
of similar correlations in everyday life. The case of Bertlmann’s socks is often cited. Dr.
Bertlmann likes to wear two socks of different colours. Which colour he will have on a given
foot on a given day is quite unpredictable. But when you see that the ﬁrst sock is pink you can
be already sure that the second sock will not be pink. Observation of the ﬁrst, and experience
of Bertlmann, gives immediate information about the second. There is no accounting for
tastes, but apart from that there is no mystery here. And is not the EPR business just the
same? [10]
Bell then reviews Bohm’s reformulation of the EPR setup, with the two entangled
spin-1/2 particles, including also a nice discussion of the difﬁculty of understand-
ing the results of individual Stern–Gerlach spin measurements in terms of classical

108
4
The Locality Problem
magnetic dipoles one of whose pre-existing components is simply revealed by the
measurement. Bell continues:
Phenomena of this kind made physicists despair of ﬁnding any consistent space-time picture
of what goes on on the atomic and subatomic scale. Making a virtue of necessity, and
inﬂuenced by positivistic and instrumentalist philosophies, many came to hold not only that
it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a coherent picture but that it is wrong to look for one – if not actually
immoral then certainly unprofessional. Going further still, some asserted that atomic and
subatomic particles do not have any deﬁnite properties in advance of observation. There is
nothing, that is to say, in the particles approaching the [Stern–Gerlach] magnet, to distinguish
those subsequently deﬂected up from those subsequently deﬂected down. Indeed even the
particles are not really there. [Note: to help prevent the reader from getting lost in quotes
within quotes, passages that Bell quotes from other authors are italicized in the remainder of
this block quote as well as the following one. In particular, the following italicized passages
are quotations from Peterson, Heisenberg, Zilsel, Pauli, and Born.]
For example, [Bohr’s colleague Peterson recalled that] Bohr once declared when asked
whether the quantum mechanical algorithm could be considered as somehow mirroring an
underlying quantum reality: ‘There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum
mechanical description. It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to ﬁnd out how Nature
is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature’.
And for Heisenberg ...in the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and
facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena of daily life. But the atoms or
the elementary particles are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities
rather than one of things or facts.
And [Zilsel recollects] Jordan declared, with emphasis, that observations not only disturb
what has to be measured, they produce it. In a measurement of position, for example, as
performed with the gamma ray microscope, ‘the electron is forced to a decision. We compel
it to assume a deﬁnite position; previously it was, in general, neither here nor there; it had
not yet made its decision for a deﬁnite position... If by another experiment the velocity of the
electron is being measured, this means: the electron is compelled to decide itself for some
exactly deﬁned value of the velocity... we ourselves produce the results of measurement’.
It is in the context of ideas like these that one must envisage the discussion of the Einstein–
Podolsky–Rosen correlations. Then it is a little less unintelligible that the EPR paper caused
such a fuss, and that the dust has not settled even now. It is as if we had come to deny the
reality of Bertlmann’s socks, or at least of their colours, when not looked at. And as if a child
had asked: How come they always choose different colours when they are looked at? How
does the second sock know what the ﬁrst has done?
Paradox indeed! But for the others, not for EPR. EPR did not use the word ‘paradox’. They
were with the man in the street in this business. For them these correlations simply showed
that the quantum theorists had been hasty in dismissing the reality of the microscopic world.
In particular Jordan had been wrong in supposing that nothing was real or ﬁxed in that world
before observation. For after observing only one particle the result of subsequently observing
the other (possibly at a very remote place) is immediately predictable. Could it be that the
ﬁrst observation somehow ﬁxes what was unﬁxed, or makes real what was unreal, not only
for the near particle but also for the remote one? For EPR that would be an unthinkable
‘spooky action at a distance’. To avoid such action at a distance they have to attribute, to
the space-time regions in question, real properties in advance of observation, correlated
properties, which predetermine the outcomes of these particular observations. Since these
real properties, ﬁxed in advance of observation, are not contained in quantum formalism, that
formalism for EPR is incomplete. It may be correct, as far as it goes, but the usual quantum
formalism cannot be the whole story [10].

4.5 Bell’s Re-Telling
109
That, I submit, is as clear as anyone will ever make the EPR argument, and it would
seem appropriate to end the Chapter on that note.
But in the paper Bell goes on to discuss another aspect of Einstein’s worries about
the quantum theory, and I think it will be very illuminating to include this here as
well:
It is important to note that to the limited degree to which determinism plays a role in the
EPR argument, it is not assumed but inferred. What is held sacred is the principle of ‘local
causality’ – or ‘no action at a distance’. Of course, mere correlation between distant events
does not by itself imply action at a distance, but only correlation between the signals reaching
the two places. These signals, in the idealized example of Bohm, must be sufﬁcient to
determine whether the particles go up or down. For any residual undeterminism could only
spoil the perfect correlation.
It is remarkably difﬁcult to get this point across, that determinism is not a presupposition of
the analysis. There is a widespread and erroneous conviction that for Einstein determinism
was always the sacred principle. The quotability of his famous ‘God does not play dice’ has
not helped in this respect. Among those who had great difﬁcult in seeing Einstein’s position
was Born. Pauli tried to help him in a letter of 1954:
...I was unable to recognize Einstein whenever you talked about him in either your letter or
your manuscript. It seemed to me as if you had erected some dummy Einstein for yourself,
which you then knocked down with great pomp. In particular, Einstein does not consider the
concept of ‘determinism’ to be as fundamental as it is frequently held to be (as he told me
emphatically many times)... he disputes that he uses as a criterion for the admissibility of a
theory the question: ‘Is it rigorously deterministic?’ ... he was not at all annoyed with you,
but only said you were a person who will not listen.
Born had particular difﬁculty with the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen argument. Here is his sum-
ming up, long afterwards, when he edited the Born-Einstein correspondence:
The root of the difference between Einstein and me was the axiom that events which happen
in different places A and B are independent of one another, in the sense that an observation
on the state of affairs at B cannot teach us anything about the state of affairs at A.
Misunderstanding could hardly be more complete. Einstein had no difﬁculty accepting that
affairs in different places could be correlated. What he could not accept was that an inter-
vention at one place could inﬂuence, immediately, affairs at the other.
These references to Born are not meant to diminish one of the towering ﬁgures of modern
physics. They are meant to illustrate the difﬁculty of putting aside preconceptions and listen-
ing to what is actually being said. They are meant to encourage you, dear listener, to listen
a little harder [10].
Bell then closes this section of his paper by quoting the following “summing-up by
Einstein himself”, which is from Einstein’s 1948 Dialectica essay:
If one asks what, irrespective of quantum mechanics, is characteristic of the world of ideas
in physics, one is ﬁrst of all struck by the following: the concepts of physics relate to a real
outside world.... It is further characteristic of these physical objects that they are thought of
as arranged in a space-time continuum. An essential aspect of this arrangement of things in
physics is that they lay claim, at a certain time, to an existence independent of one another,
provided these objects ‘are situated in different parts of space.’
The following idea characterizes the relative independence of objects far apart in space (A
and B): external inﬂuence on A has no direct inﬂuence on B...
There seems to me no doubt that those physicists who regard the descriptive methods of
quantum mechanics as deﬁnitive in principle would react to this line of thought in the

110
4
The Locality Problem
following way: they would drop the requirement ... for the independent existence of the
physical reality present in different parts of space; they would be justiﬁed in pointing out
that the quantum theory nowhere makes explicit use of this requirement.
I admit this, but would point out: when I consider the physical phenomena known to me,
and especially those which are being so successfully encompassed by quantum mechanics, I
still cannot ﬁnd any fact anywhere which would make it appear likely that (that) requirement
will have to be abandoned.
I am therefore inclined to believe that the description of quantum mechanics ... has to be
regarded as an incomplete and indirect description of reality, to be replaced at some later
date by a more complete and direct one [11].
And that seems like an entirely ﬁtting way to close this chapter.
Projects:
4.1 What is the Bothe-Geiger experiment that Einstein mentions in his 1927 Solvay
remarks? Do a little research and report back. (Hint: it relates to Compton
scattering and something called the Bohr–Kramers–Slater or “BKS” theory,
which was a kind of pre-cursor to the formal quantum theory that eventually
developed.)
4.2 In the text, our application of Bell’s formulation of “locality” to the Einstein’s
Boxes argument consisted of showing that quantum theory (with the complete-
ness assumption and with the collapse postulate) violates locality. One could
also, however, put the same pieces together in a slightly different way – showing
that quantum theory (with the completeness assumption but not the collapse
postulate) implies, if you assume locality, that there should be a nonzero prob-
ability for detecting the same one particle twice, once in the left half-box and
once again in the right half-box. Explain carefully how this argument would
go.
4.3 Show that the commutator

ˆx, ˆp

= ˆx ˆp −ˆp ˆx of ˆx and ˆp is the constant iℏ.
Hint: let

ˆx, ˆp

act on an arbitrary function f (x), using ˆx = x and ˆp = −iℏd
dx ,
and show that you get iℏf (x).
4.4 Prove that, if the commutator of two operators ˆA and ˆB is the (nonzero) constant
c, then there cannot exist a state ψ which is a simultaneous eigenstate of both ˆA
and ˆB. Use this, along with the results of Project [4.3], to argue that in quantum
mechanics there cannot be a state which attributes a sharp value to position and
momentum simultaneously – a point that was crucial in the EPR argument.
4.5 Give a careful summary of the argument for incompleteness that Einstein gives
in his “Autobiographical Notes” (quoted in Sect.4.3).
4.6 One assumption of all these EPR-type arguments, that is sometimes taken for
granted and not given the attention it maybe deserves, is the assumption that
the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics in the relevant situations are
actually correct. For example, in the “boxes” type argument, it is assumed that,
indeed, each particle will only be found at one place later. An early experiment
by Ádám, Jánossy, and Varga (ÁJV) attempted to test this prediction, but their
results were not very conclusive. Here is a bit of description, though, from John
Clauser, who re-did a more convincing version of the experiment in the 1970s:

4.5 Bell’s Re-Telling
111
As an original heretic to the standard religion, [Schrödinger] persuaded Ádám, Ján-
nosy and Varga (ÁJV) to actually perform [this] experiment[:] two independent photo-
detectors are placed respectively in the transmitted and reﬂected beams of a half-silvered
mirror. If photons have a particle-like character, i.e., if their detectable components
are always spatially bounded and well localized, then photons impinging on the half-
silvered mirror will not be split in two at this mirror. On the other hand, if they are purely
wave-like in nature, ... then they can and will be split into two independent classical
wave packets at this mirror. This fact then implies that if they are purely wave-like
(in this classical sense), then the two detectors will show coincidences when a single
temporally localized photon is directed at said mirror. One of these independent wave
packets will be transmitted to illuminate the ﬁrst detector, and the other will be reﬂected
to illuminate the second detector, and both detectors will then have a ﬁnite probability
of detecting the same photon (classical wave packet). This latter possibility, however,
violates the predictions [of quantum theory] which prohibits such coincidences. ÁJV
thus searched for anomalous coincidences between photomultiplier tubes that viewed
the reﬂected and transmitted beams behind a half -silvered mirror [12].
Take a look at Clauser’s experimental paper, Ref. [13], reporting the results of
his later version of this kind of experiment. Summarize his experimental setup
and ﬁndings.
4.7 Read the actual EPR paper [6] and report back, sharing any insights, confusions,
and/or questions.
4.8 Recall the quantum mechanical collapse postulate: when a measurement of
some observable is made, the quantum state changes suddenly and discontin-
uously into the particular eigenstate (of that observable) corresponding to the
actually-realized outcome of the measurement. The theme of Chap.3 could
perhaps be summarized by saying that there are two different ways one could
interpret this collapse rule, and each seems problematic: ﬁrst, if you think of
the collapse as describing a real physical change in the state of the system,
i.e., as a dynamical process, this seems impossible to reconcile with the nor-
mal system dynamics (namely Schrödinger’s equation); whereas, second, if
you think of the collapse as describing a mere updating of information, i.e., as
describing a change in our knowledge not implying any change in the physical
state of the thing described, then the quantum state descriptions are revealed
as obviously incomplete. Explain how the EPR dilemma between locality and
completeness can be understood in these same terms, with the two horns of the
dilemma corresponding exactly to the two views (dynamic vs. epistemic) one
might take to wave function collapse. What, exactly, does the EPR argument
then add to the arguments from Chap.3? How is it different or better?
4.9 Illustrate the EPR scenario on a space-time diagram showing (i) the prepara-
tion of the two-particles at some central source, (ii) the separating of the two
entangled particles, and (iii) the measuring equipment that will perhaps be used
to measure some property of one or both properties. Can Bell’s formulation of
“locality” be used to rehearse a more formally rigorous version of the argu-
ment, along the lines of what we did in the Chapter with the Einstein’s Boxes
argument? If so, explain how; or if not, explain why not. (Note: this is a bit of a

trick question, for reasons that will be discussed in the following Chapter. But
it is still well worth thinking about here.)
4.10 Re-write the “EPR-Bohm state” (that is, the spin-singlet state of the two
spatially-separated spin 1/2 particles), Eq.(4.10), in terms of the states ψ+x
and ψ−x, whose relation to the states ψ+z and ψ−z are explained in Chap.2.
Use your re-writing to argue that not only, as explained in the text, a measure-
ment of σz on particle 1 provides an indirect determination of the value of σz
of particle 2, but that also a measurement of σx on particle 1 provides an indi-
rect determination of the value of σx of particle 2. Discuss how and whether
and under what assumptions this all implies that the distant particle must pos-
sess (contrary to what you’d say if you believe the quantum state provides a
complete description) deﬁnite values of both σx and σz.
4.11 Re-write the EPR-Bohm spin state in terms of the states ψ+n and ψ−n from
Chap.2. Thus show that the singlet state takes the same mathematical form
for spin components along any arbitrary axis, and that therefore the argument
from the text, establishing the real existence of σz for the distant particle (which
argument was already generalized to σx in Project 4.10) applies to all possible
axes.
4.12 Suppose two spin 1/2 particles are prepared in the EPR-Bohm spin state,
Eq.(4.10). Now suppose that the spin of one of the particles (say, particle 1)
is measured along the z-direction, and the spin of the other particle (2) is
measured along the direction ˆn (in the x −z-plane and making an angle θ
with respect to the z-axis). What are the probabilities for the four possible
joint outcomes (i.e., “particle 1 is spin-up/spin-down along z and particle 2
is spin-up/spin-down along n)? To answer this, write the EPR-Bohm state
as a linear combination of four terms of the form ψ1
±zψ2
±n and read off the
probabilities as the absolute squares of the coefﬁcients. Finally, compute the
“correlation coefﬁcient”, deﬁned here as the expected value of the product of
the two outcomes, taking spin-up/spin-down as +1/−1:
C = (+1)(+1)P+++(+1)(−1)P+−+(−1)(+1)P−++(−1)(−1)P−−. (4.11)
Doesthecorrelationcoefﬁcientmakesenseinvariouslimitingcaseslikeθ = 0?
4.13 Sometimes the EPR argument (say, in the Bohm version in terms of spin) is
explained as follows: “you can determine both σx and σz for the same one
particle at the same time, by measuring one of these quantities directly (i.e.,
by actually measuring it on that particle) and then by also measuring the other
quantity indirectly (i.e., by actually measuring that same quantity on the other
particle and then attributing the opposite value to the particle in question).”
The conclusion is then something like: “...so both of these properties must be
real (or, at least, you can learn more about them than is supposed to be allowed
by the uncertainty principle) and QM is incomplete.” Is this a good argument?
Discuss its merits and its relation to the actual EPR argument.
4.14 Here is a paragraph from the Wikipedia page on the “EPR Paradox” (grabbed
on Jan 7, 2016):

4.5 Bell’s Re-Telling
113
While EPR felt that the paradox showed that quantum theory was incomplete and
should be extended with hidden variables, the usual modern resolution is to say that
due to the common preparation of the two particles (for example the creation of an
electron-positron pair from a photon) the property we want to measure has a well
deﬁned meaning only when analyzed for the whole system while the same property for
the parts individually remains undeﬁned. Therefore if similar measurements are being
performed on the two entangled subsystems, there will always be a correlation between
the outcomes resulting in a well deﬁned global outcome, i.e., for both subsystems
together. However, the outcomes for each subsystem separately at each repetition of the
experiment will not be well deﬁned or predictable. This correlation does not imply any
action of the measurement of one particle on the measurement of the other, therefore it
doesn’t imply any form of action at a distance. This modern resolution eliminates the
need for hidden variables, action at a distance or other structures introduced over time
in order to explain the phenomenon.
Pretend that you are Einstein, magically transported to the present day, with
both internet access and too much free time. Write a few paragraphs that you
would post on the Wikipedia discussion page, explaining to the other contrib-
utors how and why the “modern resolution” described here is inadequate, and
clarifying your original argument.
4.15 In Bell’s re-telling of the EPR argument, he stresses that determinism is “not
assumed, but inferred.” This may be somewhat confusing since the notion of
“determinism” did not play much of a role in our earlier presentations of the
EPR argument. What, exactly, is the role of “determinism” in the argument? Is
Bell correct?
4.16 Provide a detailed explanation of the sort of theoretical model which could
explain the quantum mechanical predictions for the Einstein’s Boxes scenario
in a perfectly local way. Then do the same for the EPR-Bohm scenario.

Chapter 5
The Ontology Problem
The previous two chapters reviewed two important arguments against the idea that
quantum mechanics provides complete descriptions of physical reality. Here we dis-
cuss a couple of other related concerns which might be summarized by the general
question: even leaving aside the question of whether or not the description is com-
plete, what kind of physical thing – what ontology, exactly – could the quantum wave
function possibly represent, and how would that representation work?
5.1
Complexity and Reality
Every student of quantum mechanics learns that the wave function  is complex:
it has, in general, both a real part and an imaginary part. This is of course not
surprising given the explicit appearance of the imaginary quantity i = √−1 in the
time-dependent Schrödinger equation
iℏ∂
∂t = −ℏ2
2m ∇2 + V .
(5.1)
Some textbooks make a big deal of the fact that  is complex – arguing that (unlike
complex numbers that are sometimes used as a matter of convenience in for example
classical electrodynamics) the complexity of the quantum wave function is somehow
a deep and fundamental requirement with profound implications. Indeed, one of
these alleged implications is that the quantum mechanical wave function  cannot
represent a “physically real ﬁeld” in the way, for example, that the classical electric
and magnetic ﬁelds, ⃗E and ⃗B are supposed to. The classic Quantum Physics text by
Eisberg and Resnick, for example, states:

The Ontology Problem
The fact that wave functions are complex functions should not be considered a weak point in
the quantum mechanical theory. Actually, it is a desirable feature because it makes it imme-
diately apparent that we should not attempt to give to wave functions a physical existence
in the same sense that water waves have a physical existence. The reason is that a complex
quantity cannot be measured by any actual physical instrument. The ‘real’ world (using the
term in its nonmathematical sense) is the world of ‘real’ quantities (using the term in its
mathematical sense) [1, p. 134].
If such a view is correct, then evidently we would have to reject the idea that
the quantum mechanical wave function provides a complete description of physical
reality: if  cannot represent something physically real at all, because it is not a
mathematically real function, then certainly it cannot provide a faithful and full
representation!
But I do not think this type of argument is convincing at all. It is simply false that
one is somehow required to use complex numbers. For example, one could always
break the quantum wave function apart into its real and imaginary parts:
(x, t) = f (x, t) + i g(x, t)
(5.2)
(where f and g are now real functions). Then, by plugging this ansatz into
Schrödinger’s equation and taking real and imaginary parts, we can break
Schrödinger’s (complex) equation into two coupled real equations:
−ℏ∂g
∂t = −ℏ2
2m ∇2 f + V f
(5.3)
and
ℏ∂f
∂t = −ℏ2
2m ∇2g + V g.
(5.4)
We could think of this set of equations as perhaps something like Maxwell’s equa-
tions, which couple together the dynamics of the two (perfectly real!) ﬁelds ⃗E and
⃗B.
It should be clear that one can always do this: a single complex ﬁeld is mathemat-
ically equivalent to two coupled real ﬁelds. So the most the Eisberg/Resnick-type
argument could establish is that, if one wants to regard the quantum wave function as
representing something physically real, one would have to interpret it as representing
these two coupled ﬁelds.
This may sound somewhat contrived and artiﬁcial, but actually there is an even
closer parallel to all of this in Maxwellian electromagnetism that is worth pointing
out. Take, for simplicity, the case of electromagnetic ﬁelds propagating in empty
space (where the charge density ρ and the current density ⃗j both vanish). The four
Maxwell equations are then
⃗∇· ⃗E = 0
and
⃗∇· ⃗B = 0
(5.5)

5.1 Complexity and Reality
117
and then also
⃗∇× ⃗E = −∂⃗B
∂t
and
⃗∇× ⃗B = 1
c2
∂⃗E
∂t .
(5.6)
Now notice that we can rewrite these four equations – and indeed make them look a
little simpler and nicer! – by re-writing them in terms of the complex quantity
⃗F = ⃗E + ic ⃗B
(5.7)
which is sometimes called the Riemann–Silberstein vector. (Note that the “c” is put
into the deﬁnition so the units of the two terms on the right hand side are the same.)
In terms of this quantity, it is easy to see that the ﬁrst pair of Maxwell equations can
be re-expressed as:
⃗∇· ⃗F = 0.
(5.8)
The real and imaginary parts, respectively, reproduce the two entries in Eq.(5.5).
Now the cool thing is that the two entries in Eq.(5.6) can also be reproduced by
writing
⃗∇× ⃗F = i
c
∂⃗F
∂t .
(5.9)
You should take a second and check that, indeed, the real and imaginary parts of this
equation correspond exactly to the two entries in Eq.(5.6).
One can even rearrange the last equation into the following form:
iℏ∂⃗F
∂t = ℏc ⃗∇× ⃗F
(5.10)
whose structure is rather like that of Schrödinger’s equation:
iℏ∂⃗F
∂t = ˆH ⃗F
(5.11)
where, evidently, the Hamiltonian operator here is
ˆH = ℏc ⃗∇× .
(5.12)
Indeed, the complex vector ⃗F can (with some caveats) be understood as a kind of
“quantum wave function for the photon.” But we will not pursue this interesting
connection any further here.
Ourpointisinsteadjustthatthedynamicalequations–thatis,Maxwell’sequations
– for the ﬁelds ⃗E and ⃗B can be re-expressed in an elegant form by combining ⃗E and
⃗B into a single, complex-valued quantity, ⃗F. Yet nobody, I think, regards this as some
kind of proof that ⃗F cannot correspond to anything physically real. It does! Its real
part – ⃗E – corresponds to the physically real electric ﬁeld, and its imaginary part

118
5
The Ontology Problem
– ⃗B – corresponds to the physically real magnetic ﬁeld. We should therefore allow
this same ﬂexibility of mathematical representation in the case of the quantum wave
function  and remain open to the possibility that, despite being complex-valued, it
represents a physically real (or perhaps more than one coupled physically real) ﬁeld.
5.2
Conﬁguration Space
There is, however, a different mathematical fact about the quantum wave function 
that leads to a much more difﬁcult and troubling question about the ontology it might
conceivably describe:  is a function on conﬁguration space. So if  represents one
or more ﬁelds – things somehow like the electromagnetic ﬁelds ⃗E and ⃗B – the
ﬁelds would be very, very unusual because they would live, not in ordinary three-
dimensional physical space, but rather a higher-dimensional and seemingly purely
abstract space.
This was, interestingly, a worry that arose almost immediately when Schrödinger
ﬁrst invented (and wrote down his dynamical equation for) the wave function. In
1926, for example, Schrödinger sent copies of his papers to a number of his col-
leagues and asked for their comments. Hendrik Lorentz, in his very ﬁrst reply,
praised Schrödinger’s work for its physical/intuitive comprehensibility (compared
to the more purely mathematical, and hence physically obscure, “matrix mechanics”
which had previously been developed by Heisenberg and others). But Lorentz also
raised a number of concerns about Schrödinger’s wave mechanics, and the very ﬁrst
of these concerns had to do with the fact that the wave was not a wave in physical
space but instead the abstract conﬁguration space:
Dear Colleague,
I am ﬁnally getting around to answering your letter and to thanking you very much for
kindly sending me the proof sheets of your three articles, all of which I have in fact received.
Reading these has been a real pleasure to me. Of course the time for a ﬁnal judgment has not
come yet, and there are still many difﬁculties, it seems to me, about which I shall get to speak
immediately. But even if it should turn out that a satisfactory solution cannot be reached in
this way, one would still admire the sagacity that shows forth from your considerations, and
one would still venture to hope that your efforts will contribute in a fundamental way to
penetrating these mysterious matters.
I was particularly pleased with the way in which you really construct the appropriate matrices
and show that these satisfy the equations of motion. This dispels a misgiving that the works
of Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan, as well as Pauli’s, had inspired in me: namely, that I could
not see clearly that in the case of the H-atom, for example, a solution of the equations of
motion can really be speciﬁed. With your clever observation that the operators q and
∂
∂q
commute or do not commute with each other in a similar way to the q and p in the matrix
calculation, I began to see the point. In spite of everything it remains a marvel that equations
in which the q’s and p’s originally signiﬁed coordinates and momenta, can be satisﬁed when
one interprets these symbols as things that have quite another meaning, and only remotely
recall those coordinates and momenta.
If I had to choose now between your wave mechanics and the matrix mechanics, I would
give the preference to the former, because of its greater intuitive clarity, so long as one only

5.2 Conﬁguration Space
119
has to deal with the three coordinates x, y, z. If, however, there are more degrees of freedom,
then I cannot interpret the waves and vibrations physically, and I must therefore decide in
favor of matrix mechanics. But your way of thinking has the advantage for this case too that
it brings us closer to the real solution of the equations; the eigenvalue problem is the same
in principle for a higher dimensional q-space as it is for a three dimensional space [2, p.
43–44].
Note in particular the suddenness – the immediate ﬁnality – with which Lorentz
simplydismissesthepossibilitythatafunctiononconﬁgurationspacecouldrepresent
a physically real ﬁeld: “I cannot interpret the waves and vibrations physically....”
Indeed, it is interesting that Lorentz does not just say that, in the case of two
(or more) particles where the conﬁguration space is 6- (or more) dimensional, he is
confused about how to interpret Schrödinger’s wave function. Instead, he says he
would prefer in this case to go back to the physically obscure matrix mechanics. We
can only speculate about exactly what he meant, and this was admittedly only a ﬁrst
impression, but one gets the feeling that he preferred to have no intuitive physical
interpretation available at all, rather than one which was so obviously absurd as to
suggest the existence of ﬁelds/waves in an unphysical, abstract space.
Einstein expressed a similar concern about Schrödinger’s wave function in letters
from this same period. Here are some excerpts, all quoted in Ref. [3]:
• “Schrödinger’s conception of the quantum rules makes a great impression on me;
it seems to me to be a bit of reality, however unclear the sense of waves in n-
dimensional q-space remains”. (May 1, 1926, to Lorentz)
• “Schrödinger’s works are wonderful – but even so one nevertheless hardly comes
closer to a real understanding. The ﬁeld in a many-dimensional coordinate space
does not smell like something real.” (June 18, 1926, to Ehrenfest)
• “The method of Schrödinger seems indeed more correctly conceived than that of
Heisenberg, and yet it is hard to place a function in coordinate space and view it
as an equivalent for a motion. But if one could succeed in doing something similar
in four-dimensional space, then it would be more satisfying.” (June 22, 1926, to
Lorentz)
• “Of the new attempts to obtain a deeper formulation of the quantum laws, that by
Schrödinger pleases me most. If only the undulatory ﬁelds introduced there could
be transplanted from the n-dimensional coordinate space to the 3 or 4 dimen-
sional!” (August 21, 1926, to Sommerfeld)
• “Schrödinger is, in the beginning, very captivating. But the waves in n-dimensional
coordinate space are indigestible...” (August 28, 1926, to Ehrenfest)
• “The quantum theory has been completely Schrödingerized and has much practical
success from that. But this can nevertheless not be the description of a real process.
It is a mystery.” (February 16, 1927, to Lorentz)
Even Schrödinger himself admitted quite openly that, as a function on conﬁgu-
ration space, the wave function can’t really be understood as corresponding to some
kind of physically real wave. In the abstract of “Wave Mechanics,” his contribution
to the 1927 Solvay conference, he wrote:

120

The Ontology Problem
Of course this use of the q-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often
applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately ... the process to be described is one in space
and time [4, p. 447].
In the body of the paper he elaborates on the crucial question:
What does the ψ-function mean now, that is, how does the system described by it really look
like in three dimensions? Many physicists today are of the opinion that it does not describe
the occurrences in an individual system, but only the processes in an ensemble of very many
like constituted systems that do not sensibly inﬂuence one another and are all under the
very same conditions. I shall skip this point of view since others are presenting it. I myself
have so far found useful the following perhaps somewhat naive but quite concrete idea.
The classical system of material points does not really exist, instead there exists something
that continuously ﬁlls the entire space and of which one would obtain a ‘snapshot’ if one
dragged the classical system, with the camera shutter open, through all its conﬁgurations,
the representative point in q-space spending in each volume element dτ a time that is
proportional to the instantaneous value of ψψ∗. (The value of ψψ∗for only one value of the
argument t is thus in question.) Otherwise stated: the real system is a superposition of the
classical one in all its possible states, using ψψ∗as ‘weight function’ [4, p. 453].
The ﬁrst view that Schrödinger mentions here – according to which the ψ function
“does not describe ... an individual system” but instead characterizes “an ensemble
of very many like constituted systems” – is the idea, argued for in the previous two
chapters, that the wave function does not provide a complete description of physical
reality.
But in contrast to these interpretations Schrödinger here suggests an alternative
view in which physical reality really is faithfully described by the wavy, spread-out
wave function. He speaks of “something that continuously ﬁlls the entire space” and
then suggests that one could perhaps understand “the real system [as] a superposition
of the classical one in all its possible states, using ψψ∗as a ‘weight function’.”
For a single particle, whose wave function ψ(⃗x, t) lives in ordinary, physical,
three-dimensional space, one can understand this idea as saying that the “particle”
is really a cloud whose density is given by the square of the wave function. For
example, one could characterize the electron in terms of a mass density
ρm(⃗x, t) = m |ψ(⃗x, t)|2
(5.13)
or an electric charge density
ρe(⃗x, t) = e |ψ(⃗x, t)|2
(5.14)
where m and e are the total mass and charge of the electron. One often sees – in,
for example, Chemistry textbooks – pictures of the “electron cloud” surrounding the
nucleus for, say, different states of the Hydrogen atom. Such pictures invite you to
think of the wave function in the way that Schrödinger was suggesting here.
The problem, of course, is that this interpretation doesn’t make any sense as soon
as one has a quantum system with more than one particle in it. Then the wave function
 is a function on conﬁguration space, and so the “charge density”

5.2 Conﬁguration Space
121
ρ ∼||2
(5.15)
would also be a charge density in this high-dimensional, abstract space. And that, to
use Einstein’s phrase, simply “does not smell like something real”.
It is sometimes difﬁcult for people to fully grasp the nature of the problem asso-
ciated with the fact that the quantum mechanical wave function (for a system of
more than 2 particles) is a function on conﬁguration space. Basically the prob-
lem is that, mathematically, the wave function is – like the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds of classical electrodynamics – a function of continuous spatial degrees of free-
dom which satisﬁes a dynamical evolution equation with the general structure of a
wave equation, i.e., a partial differential equation relating spatial and temporal par-
tial derivatives. Mathematically, in short, the wave function seems to look and act
like a ﬁeld. But unlike the familiar and unproblematic electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
⃗E = ⃗E(⃗x, t) and ⃗B = ⃗B(⃗x, t), we cannot ask for the value of the wave function
at a point in three-dimensional space at a particular time: it is not  = (⃗x, t) but
rather  = (⃗x1, ⃗x2, ..., ⃗xN, t). So if the wave function describes a ﬁeld, it would
not appear to be a physical ﬁeld in the sense that we are accustomed to thinking about
⃗E and ⃗B from electrodynamics. So if the wave function provides a description of
some physically real things or stuff, the description must be in some sense indirect,
abstract.
But whereas a single point in 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space can be eas-
ily understood as an abstract representation of the conﬁguration of N particles in
3-dimensional physical space (that was the kind of thing we discussed when “con-
ﬁguration space” came up in Chap.1), it is hard to see what kind of thing a ﬁeld in
conﬁguration space might be an abstract representation of. That is, when we are deal-
ing with a multi-particle wave function in quantum mechanics, it is simply not clear,
the way it is clear when we use conﬁguration space in the context of the classical
mechanics of particles, what we are talking about!
Ofcourse,oneapparentpossibility(theonementionedﬁrstbySchrödinger)would
be that the wave function simply describes our incomplete knowledge of the state of
a set of (literal, pointlike) particles. On this view, the wave function isn’t a physical
thing (like a ﬁeld) at all – the wave function, that is, is epistemic, not ontological.
As discussed already in Chap.3, this interpretation is very difﬁcult to reconcile with,
for example, the existence of 2-slit interference. Still, it is helpful to have in mind as
a possible way of avoiding the “ontology problem” which, it would seem, is going
to afﬂict any theory that takes the quantum mechanical wave function seriously, as
providing a direct and literal description of some kind of physically real thing. This
problem would seem to be particularly worrisome for the orthodox viewpoint accord-
ing to which the wave function provides a complete description of the physical state
of the system being described. The ontology of orthodox quantum mechanics, that is,
seems entirely mysterious: the one kind of thing that we can straightforwardly under-
stand the wave function as describing (namely, a physical ﬁeld living in the abstract,
high-dimensional conﬁguration space) seems unacceptably bizarre and absurd and,
indeed, seems not really to be a legitimate physical “thing” at all.

122

The Ontology Problem
Perhaps we can thus summarize “the ontology problem” as follows: in quantum
mechanics, there simply is nothing in the theory other than the wave function 
with which to describe the physical state of a microscopic system; but it simply is
not clear how the wave function  might be understood as describing some mate-
rial structures in three-dimensional physical space. Put simply, it is just not at all
clear, from the mathematical formulation of the theory, what sort of physical things
quantum mechanics might be about.
In Sect.5.4 we will consider an old idea of Schrödinger’s for trying to address
the question: what kind of (ﬁeld-like) physical reality might the wave function be an
abstract representation of ? But ﬁrst, let us develop a bit further our thinking about
the nature of the ontology problem in general.
5.3
Ontology, Measurement, and Locality
To help ﬂesh out the problem and to emphasize its fundamentality, let’s explore the
connections between the ontology problem and the other two problems we discussed
in the previous two chapters.
Recall ﬁrst the measurement problem. Here is a quick summary of the way we
presented the problem in Chap.3, using the concrete example of the particle-in-a-box
whose energy is to be measured by a device which will indicate the result with the
position of a pointer:
If the particle-in-a-box starts out in an energy eigenstate (such that it has a deﬁnite pre-
measurement energy En), the Schrödinger equation evolution of the particle-pointer system
proceeds according to
ψn(x) φ(y)
→
ψn(x) φ(y −λEnT ).
(5.16)
This is unproblematic since the ﬁnal state (x, y, T ) = ψn(x) φ(y −λEnT) describes the
particle (still) being in a state of deﬁnite energy En and describes the pointer as having
moved a deﬁnite distance (λEnT ) past its initial position, i.e., correctly and unambiguously
indicating that the energy of the particle was En.
However, if the particle-in-a-box instead starts out in a superposition of energy eigenstates,
the Schrödinger evolution of the particle-pointer wave function looks like this:

i
ciψi(x)

φ(y)
→

i
ci ψi(x) φ(y −λEi T ).
(5.17)
This is highly problematic since the ﬁnal state does not seem to attribute any particular
position to the pointer; instead, the pointer is in an (entangled) superposition of many distinct
locations, and this simply doesn’t seem to correspond to the observed behavior of real
pointers.
Our main goal in Chap.3, following Schrödinger, was to emphasize the difﬁculty
of understanding macroscopic superpositions. It was from this point of view that
we stressed the problematic character of the ﬁnal state in Eq.(5.17), as against the
comparatively unproblematic ﬁnal state in Eq.(5.16).

5.3 Ontology, Measurement, and Locality
123
But now we’d like to cycle back and ask: is the ﬁnal state in Eq.(5.16) really so
unproblematic? When we said so before, we simply took for granted that we could
understand a product state like
(x, y, T ) = ψn(x) φ(y −λEnT )
(5.18)
as saying “the particle-in-a-box is in the nth energy eigenstate” and “the pointer is a
distance λEnT to the right of its ready position”. But what is really going on when
we interpret this state this way?
First of all, we are assuming that when the overall wave function is a product, we
can simply “peel apart” the factors and take them individually as describing the states
of the individual sub-systems in question. As straightforward as this is in the case
of a product state, though, it is simply not possible in general: as soon as the overall
state fails to be a product, nothing like this straightforward mathematical “peeling
apart” procedure is possible. So we should probably be suspicious of the propriety
of this procedure in general, i.e., even in the special kind of situation where it is
technically possible.
Second, our descriptions of the physical meanings of the individual factors were a
little bit abstract. For example, to say that the particle-in-a-box has a certain energy is
really just to say that an appropriate energy measuring device will respond in a certain
way if it is allowed to interact with the particle. A more direct and literal description
of the state of the particle (in terms of constitutive rather than dispositional properties,
one might say) would instead just say: its wave function has a certain spatial structure,
namely, that of ψn(x).
The overall point is that if we simply take the quantum mechanical description
literally, then the state of the particle-pointer system is just given by its wave function
. And this, taken at face value, means that there are some regions of the abstract
(here, two-dimensional) conﬁguration space where  has “high intensity”. This is
depicted, in Fig.5.1, for the ﬁnal states (x, y, T ) associated with the two cases from
Eqs.(5.16) and (5.17). And then the point is that, even in the simpler case depicted
in the left panel, which we previously regarded as relatively unproblematic, there is
a question about how this wave function corresponds to the kinds of physical objects
we thought we were describing. This high intensity region of conﬁguration space
– the “blob” colored grey in the left panel of Fig.5.1 – doesn’t exactly look like
a particle-in-a-box (in some particular state) and a pointer (with some reasonably
sharp location), each moving in a one-dimensional physical space.
To be clear, the claim here is not that this problem is insoluble. The obvious
response would be to insist that the “blob” in conﬁguration space does represent
the state of our two particles, but the representation is somehow indirect or abstract.
After all, the single dot in the right-hand panel of Fig.1.12, back in Chap.1, didn’t
really “look like” the two particles depicted, in ordinary physical space, in the left-
hand panel of that same Figure. And yet we have no trouble understanding how the
one thing can perfectly well represent the other. Isn’t it just the same here with our
quantum mechanical wave functions?

Fig. 5.1 “Conﬁguration space cartoons” showing the intensity of (x, y, T ) for the two cases
discussed in the text. The left panel corresponds to Eq.(5.16), in which the particle-in-a-box (whose
energy is being measured) begins in the nth energy eigenstate (here the case n = 2 is depicted) and
the pointer’s ﬁnal position is yn (so, here, y2). The right panel corresponds to Eq.(5.17), in which
the particle-in-a-box begins in a superposition of several energy eigenstates, and so the pointer ends
up in an entangled superposition involving several different positions (here y1, y2, and y3). The
novel point being developed in the present chapter is that, in addition to the difﬁculties associated
with the wave function depicted in the right panel, there is a deeper kind of problem: even the single
blob in the left panel does not, on its face, “look like” two particles (the particle-in-the-box and the
pointer) moving in one spatial dimension. The relationship between the quantum mechanical wave
function, and some ontology of objects in three-dimensional space, remains obscure
The point is: it might well be. But unlike the case of classical mechanics, where
we started out with a clear ontology of particles (moving and interacting in three-
dimensional space) and then constructed abstract representations, like conﬁguration
space, to describe these particles in a new way; here, in the quantum mechanical
case, we only have, as yet, the abstract representation. We don’t yet know what kind
of reality, what sort of physically real objects or stuff, in three-dimensional space,
the wave functions might be abstract representations of.
Pointing out that quantum mechanics suffers from an “ontology problem” is thus
largely a plea for help: anyone who says that quantum mechanical wave functions
should be taken seriously, as corresponding in some sense to physical reality (as
opposed, for example, to our incomplete knowledge), should be asked to explain in
concrete, mundane detail how that alleged correspondence works. They should tell us
what sorts of things (particles?) or stuff (ﬁelds??) quantum mechanics is about, and
clarify in precise mathematical detail the relationship between those things (and/or
that stuff) and quantum mechanical wave functions. Until or unless this is done, I
think we have to admit that the connection with the three-dimensional reality of direct
experience remains puzzling, not only for the ﬁnal state described in Eq.(5.17), but
also – already – for the state described in Eq.(5.16).
Let us then turn to exploring how the “ontology problem” relates to the other of
the two big worries we explored previously: the “locality problem”.
The locality problem, recall, was that – if one regards quantum mechanical wave
functions as providing complete descriptions of physical states – then quantum

5.3 Ontology, Measurement, and Locality

mechanics evidently violates the relativistic notion of local causality. We developed
Bell’s careful formulation of local causality in Chap.1 and then showed explicitly,
in Chap.3, how local causality is violated by ordinary quantum mechanics (assumed
complete) in the “Einstein’s Boxes” scenario. But you might have noticed that we
never applied our explicit formulation of local causality to the two-entangled-particle
EPR scenario in the same way.
The reason for this has to do with the ontology problem. Recall that, in Bell’s
formulation of locality, we need to compare the probabilities assigned to some event,
conditioned on a complete speciﬁcation of the physical state on a slice across the
past light cone of that event, when some distant event is, and is not, also speciﬁed.
In the EPR-Bohm situation, in which the two particles are jointly in the spin singlet

(5.19)
for example, we might ask whether
P [ A | C ] = P [ A | C, B ]
(5.20)
where A is, say, the event “particle 1 comes out spin-up along the z-direction”, B is
the event “particle 2 comes out spin-up along the z-direction”, and C is a complete
speciﬁcation of the physical state in region  indicated in Fig.5.2.
Intuitively, one wants to say that locality is violated, because, according to quan-
tum mechanics (assumed complete) there is just an irreducible 50/50 probability for
a z-spin measurement on particle 1 to come out up/down. So the probability on the
left hand side of Eq.(5.20) is 50%. Whereas if we specify also B – that a z-spin mea-
surement on particle 2 comes out spin-up – then the probability assigned to particle
1 being spin-up along the z-direction, i.e., the right hand side of Eq.(5.20) is instead
zero. So locality is violated, just as in the one-particle Einstein’s Boxes scenario.

The Ontology Problem
But is it really so clear that, for example, P [A|C] = 50% ? What, exactly, is
C here? Again, intuitively, one wants to say: it is the complete quantum mechanical
description of the state of particle 1, i.e., the wave function of particle 1. But when
particles 1 and 2 are in an entangled state, there is simply no such thing as “the
wave function of particle 1”. One cannot “peel apart” the two-particle state into two
one-particle states when the two-particle state is entangled.
This may be slightly obscure since, in the EPR-Bohm scenario, we are largely
suppressing the spatial degrees of freedom of the two particles and focusing on the
(more abstract) spin degrees of freedom. But (as we saw already in Chap.2) it is
perfectly possible for the spatial degrees of freedom of two particles to be entangled.
Indeed, you will recall that the original EPR argument was framed in terms of an
exampleinvolvingtheentanglementofthespatialdegreesoffreedomoftwoparticles.
Here is another example that is a little better suited to our immediate needs here:
suppose that particle 1 is deﬁnitely in a room a million miles to the West, either
on the left side of the room (ψW
L ) or on the right side of the room (ψW
R ). Similarly,
particle 2 is in a different room, a million miles to the East, either on the left side of
that room (ψE
L ) or the right side of that room (ψE
R). Then suppose in particular that
the two particles are in the following entangled state
(x1, x2) =
1
√
2

ψW
L (x1) ψE
L (x2) + ψW
R (x1) ψE
R(x2)

(5.21)
which can be understood as a superposition of “both particles are on the left sides of
their respective rooms” and “both particles are on the right sides of their respective
rooms”.
It should be clear that, if the quantum mechanical state of the two particles jointly
is given by Eq.(5.21), it is impossible to assign a one-particle wave function to either
particle alone. If you have even the slightest doubt about this, take a minute and try
to work out what you think “the wave function of particle 1” is, for example.1
The problem here is of course just the problem we’ve been focusing on in this
chapter: quantum mechanical wave functions for multiple-particle systems are some-
thing like ﬁelds, but in an abstract conﬁguration space rather than ordinary three-
dimensional physical space. So it is simply not meaningful to, for example, consider
“the part” of such a wave function that describes goings-on in a particular region
of space such as  in Fig.5.2. There is no such “part” because the wave function
doesn’t live in (ordinary, three-dimensional, physical) space to begin with.
1Experts may object here that, although one cannot assign a one-particle wave function to either
particle in this kind of situation, one may nevertheless describe the state of each particle separately
using something called a reduced density matrix. This is in some sense true but is nevertheless
ultimately unhelpful. The reduced density matrix for particle 1 is a formal way of expressing that
particle 1 is either on the left, or the right, side of its room, with 50/50 probability. And then similarly
for particle 2. But then, crucially, the two reduced density matrices together fail to capture everything
that is implied by Eq.(5.21); in particular, the correlation between the positions of the two particles
(namely the fact that either both are on the left or both are on the right), is lost. So it is simply not
true that the two reduced density matrices jointly capture, in the form of state descriptions for the
two particles separately, the full state of the two-particle system as given in Eq.(5.21).

5.3 Ontology, Measurement, and Locality
127
So what does this mean, with respect to the question of whether quantum mechan-
ics (assumed complete) is a local theory? One might think that, by showing that we
cannot cleanly apply Bell’s formulation of locality to diagnose the theory as non-
local in the EPR scenario, we leave the door open to the claim that perhaps the theory
is, after all, consistent with relativistic local causality. But that is wrong, for several
reasons.
First, we shouldn’t forget that we were already able to diagnose quantum mechan-
ics (assumed complete) as non-local in the simpler, one-particle “Einstein’s Boxes”
scenario, where the weirdness associated with multi-particle wave functions never
came up. So if the question is just “Is ordinary quantum mechanics (assumed com-
plete) a local theory?” that question has already been decisively and conclusively
answered in the negative before we even get around to considering the EPR scenario.
Second, “not cleanly diagnosable as non-local” is not the same as “local”. Indeed,
in the spirit of Pauli’s memorable phrase “not even wrong”, it would probably be
most accurate to summarize the situation by describing quantum mechanics here as
“not even non-local”. Remember what “locality” means: the causal inﬂuences that
objects, moving and interacting in three-dimensional space, exert on one another,
always propagate at the speed of light or slower. A theory which fails to provide a
clear ontology of objects moving and interacting in three-dimensional space – for
example, a theory which posits something like a physical ﬁeld that lives in a more
abstract space – doesn’t even rise to the level of making the question, of whether
causal inﬂuences always propagate at the speed of light or slower, or not, meaningful.
In this sense I think it would be appropriate to say that ordinary quantum mechanics
(assumed complete) is even less local than, for example, our paradigmatic example
of a non-local theory: Newtonian mechanics with instantaneous gravitational forces.
Whereas Newtonian mechanics provides a perfectly coherent “local ontology” (of
objects, in this case particles, that move and interact in three-dimensional space)
but posits “dynamical non-locality” (in the form of the gravitational interactions),
quantum mechanics does not even appear to provide a coherent local ontology.
And third, it is possible to cleanly diagnose quantum mechanics as violating a
modiﬁed version of Bell’s formulation, as follows. Suppose we accept Bell’s for-
mulation as reasonable, at least for the kinds of theories to which it can be cleanly
applied. This means we accept, if the two probabilities in Eq.(5.20) are different,
when C is a complete speciﬁcation of the physical state of region  in Fig.5.2
according to some candidate theory, that the theory is non-local. But then surely
if, in place of C, we conditionalize both probabilities on even more information –
say, a complete speciﬁcation of the physical state of region  and some other stuff
besides – we must still conclude that the theory is non-local if the two probabilities
are different. That is, we may take
P [A | C ] = P [ A | C, B ] ,
(5.22)
where A and B are situated as in Fig.5.3 and C includes (but is not necessarily
restricted to providing merely) a complete speciﬁcation of events in , as a necessary
condition for locality.

128

B

to the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen scenario
In particular, we may let C denote a complete speciﬁcation of events throughout
the entire universe, at some moment in time prior to the events A and B, i.e., on the
unbounded “slice” indicated by the horizontal black line in Fig.5.3. If Eq. (5.22) is
violated, for some theory, even with this hugely expanded C, then surely the theory
should be considered non-local.
The nice thing about this modiﬁed version of Bell’s formulation is that multi-
particle quantum mechanical wave functions are at least well-deﬁned at particular
moments in time. That is, we needn’t any longer worry about the impossibility of
extracting, from an entangled two-particle wave function, the “part” that pertains to
a certain region of space; instead, we can just take the theory at face value and accept
that, somehow, the ontologically mysterious two-particle wave function (x1, x2, t)
provides a complete description of the state of the two particles in question at time
t. And so  (supplemented, as appropriate, by any relevant macroscopic goings-on,
but these play no important role here and will be suppressed for simplicity) can play
the role of C in Eq.(5.22), which thus reduces to
P [ A |  ] = P [ A | , B ] .
(5.23)
But these two probabilities are simply not equal, in just exactly the intuitive way
we sketched at the beginning of this discussion: if A refers to particle 1 emerging
as “spin-up” along the z-direction, and B refers to particle 2 emerging as “spin-up”
along the z-direction, then the probability on the left hand side is 50% whereas the
one on the right hand side is zero. So our necessary condition for locality is violated,
and we must conclude that the theory is non-local.
Hopefullythislongdigressionaboutthestatusofquantummechanics,withrespect
to our concept of relativistic local causality, has illuminated an important loose end
from Chap.4. But of course the real point of this discussion, in the context of the
present chapter, is to stress the problematical character of multi-particle quantum
mechanical wave functions, taken as somehow providing complete descriptions of
the physical states of those multi-particle systems.

5.4 Schrödinger’s Suggestion for a Density in 3-Space

Schrödinger’s Suggestion for a Density in 3-Space
So far in this chapter we have been exploring the nature and fundamentality of
the ontology problem. The (ultimately untenable) idea that the wave function is
purely epistemic, with the ontology of the theory just being ordinary literal particles
(like in classical mechanics), was mentioned as at least one possible way of eluding
the problem. In this section, we turn to the one other remotely plausible proposed
solution that I know of. I think, at the end of the day, this proposed solution is also
unsatisfactory, for reasons that we will discuss. Nevertheless, it is worth exploring,
because having some relatively clear and concrete ideas in mind, for the sort of
three-dimensional physical reality that quantum mechanical wave functions might
be (complete) descriptions of, will help clarify the nature of the difﬁculty and will
put us in a better position to appreciate some more sophisticated proposals that we’ll
explore in subsequent chapters.
In the letter he wrote back to Lorentz (in response to Lorentz’s letter that was
quoted back in Sect.3.2) Schrödinger proposed an answer to the puzzle about the
wave function  (and hence any density functions proportional to ||2) being a
function on the 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space:
My dear Professor Lorentz,
You have rendered me the extraordinary honor of subjecting the train of thought in my latest
papers to a profound analysis and criticism on eleven closely written pages. I cannot ﬁnd
words with which to thank you sufﬁciently for this precious gift that you have thereby made
to me; I am deeply distressed that I have made such excessive demands on your time in this
way.....
1. You mention the difﬁculty of projecting the waves in q-space, when there are more than
three coordinates, into ordinary three dimensional space and of interpreting them physically
there. I have been very sensitive to this difﬁculty for a long time but believe that I have now
overcome it. I believe, (and I have worked it out at the end of the third article), that the
physical meaning belongs not to the quantity itself but rather to a quadratic function of it.
There [i.e., in the article] I chose [a somewhat more complicated quadratic function of ψ].
Now I want to choose more simply ψ ¯ψ [= |ψ|2], that is, the square of the absolute value
of the quantity ψ. If we now have to deal with N particles, then ψ ¯ψ (just as ψ itself) is a
function of 3N variables or, as I want to say, of N three dimensional spaces, R1, R2,..., RN.
Now ﬁrst let R1 be identiﬁed with the real space and integrate ψ ¯ψ over R2, R3, ..., RN;
second, identify R2 with the real space and integrate over R1, R3, ..., RN; and so on. The N
individual results are to be added after they have been multiplied by certain constants which
characterize the particles (their charges, according to the former theory). I consider the result
to be the electric charge density in real space [2, pp. 55–56].
That is, Schrödinger’s original idea for physically interpreting the meaning of the
wave function – even in cases of N ≥2 particles where the wave function is a
function on 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space – is to use the wave function to
construct a (mass or) charge density for each particle separately, and to then add
these together to get the total (say) charge density.
Let us express formally this idea that Schrödinger wrote in words. For an N-
particle system with wave function

130
5
The Ontology Problem
 = (⃗x1, ⃗x2, ..., ⃗xN, t)
(5.24)
we may construct the electric charge density of the ith particle this way:
ρi(⃗x, t) = qi

||2 δ3(⃗xi −⃗x) d3x1 d3x2 · · · d3xN
(5.25)
where qi is the charge of the ith particle. Note that we integrate over the coordinates of
all N particles here, but the δ-function makes the integration over the coordinates of
the ith particle trivial. So the expression here is equivalent to saying, as Schrödinger
expressed it in the letter: for the ith particle, only integrate over the coordinates
associated with all of the other particles; this gives a function of ⃗xi (and of course
t); now regard this as a function on physical space, i.e., just identify these three
remaining coordinates with the three coordinates in physical space, i.e., xi = x,
yi = y, and zi = z.
The total charge density for all N particles is then deﬁned by simply summing
the charge densities for the individual particles:
ρtotal(⃗x, t) =
N

i=1
ρi(⃗x, t).
(5.26)
And it is this total charge density which Schrödinger proposes as the physical reality
described by the wave function .
Schrödinger eventually gave up on this picture, for reasons which have to do
with another of the worries raised by Lorentz in his original letter: Schrödinger’s
equation implies that wave packets spread, as we saw in Chap.2, and so it turns out
that, as time evolves, these nice little “clouds” – lumps of nonzero charge density –
would diffuse into an increasingly blurry haze that doesn’t seem to correspond to the
relatively sharp macroscopic world that, as we saw in Chap.3, Schrödinger was at
pains to make sure to capture in the fundamental theory. And the situation appears
to be even worse when we consider the possibility of (entangled) superpositions
of macroscopically distinct states, as illustrated for example by Schrödinger’s cat.
(Appearances, however, might in this case turn out to be misleading, as we will see
in Chap.10 when we examine the “many-worlds” interpretation of Hugh Everett.)
For now, though, let us set aside these sorts of concerns about whether
Schrödinger’s suggestion – for interpreting the wave function  as describing a
“density of stuff” in three-dimensional, physical space – is ultimately viable. If we
are going to understand the wave function  as providing a complete description of
some continuous, ﬁeld-like ontology, something like Schrödinger’s suggestion will
be necessary, so we should try to understand the suggestion as carefully as possible.
Aconcreteexampleshouldhelp.Let’sthereforeconsideraone-dimensional“box”
in which particles can be conﬁned – but suppose, like the box that appeared in the last
chapter, this box has been split in half and the two halves have been carried to distant
locations. For deﬁniteness, suppose in particular that each half box has a width L

5.4 Schrödinger’s Suggestion for a Density in 3-Space
131
and the two boxes are separated by a distance d:
V (x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
0
for 0 < x < L
0
for d < x < d + L
∞
otherwise
(5.27)
Now, for example, a particle that is conﬁned to the (half-) box on the left might have
wave function
ψL(x) =
 
2
L sin
 πx
L

for 0 < x < L
0
otherwise
(5.28)
while a particle that is instead conﬁned to the (half-) box on the right might have
wave function
ψR(x) =
 
2
L sin


L

for d < x < L + d

.
(5.29)
And then of course it is possible that a particle might ﬁnd itself split between the two
(half-) boxes, i.e., in a superposition of being on the left and being on the right:
ψL+R =
1
√
2
[ψL(x) + ψR(x)] .
(5.30)
Note that, for a single particle in these various states, Schrödinger’s electric charge
density acts the way one would naively expect: if the particle’s quantum state is ψL
then that particle’s charge is smeared throughout (but is exclusively contained in) the
left box; if the particle’s quantum state is ψR then the particle’s charge is smeared
throughout (but exclusively contained in) the right box; and if the particle’s quantum
state is ψL+R the particle’s charge is half in the left box and half in the right box.
But of course our goal here is to consider situations in which there are now
two (or more, but two will sufﬁce) particles involved. Suppose, for simplicity, that
we have two particles with identical electric charges, q, but that the particles are
distinguishable. (Then we don’t need to worry about the Pauli Exclusion Princi-
ple, the symmetry/anti-symmetry properties of the two-particle wave function under
exchange, etc.) For example, perhaps particle 1 (whose coordinate we call x1) is an
electron and particle 2 (whose coordinate we call x2) is a muon.
Then let us consider three possible quantum states – call them A, B, and C – that
these two particles might be in:
• In state A
ψA = ψL(x1) ψR(x2)
(5.31)
particle 1 is deﬁnitely in the (half-) box on the left, and particle 2 is deﬁnitely in
the (half-) box on the right.
• In state B

132
5
The Ontology Problem
ψB = ψL+R(x1) ψL+R(x2)
(5.32)
particle 1 is in a superposition of being on the left and being on the right (it is
“smeared out” evenly between the two half-boxes), and so is particle 2.
• Finally, state C
ψC =
1
√
2
[ ψL(x1) ψR(x2) + ψR(x1) ψL(x2) ]
(5.33)
is an entangled superposition of (on the one hand) a state in which particle 1 is
on the left and particle 2 is on the right, and (on the other hand) a state in which
particle 1 is on the right and particle 2 is on the left.
These three different quantum states are sketched, in the two-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion space, in Fig.5.4. And it should be clear – both from the mathematical deﬁnitions
of the three states and from the pictures in the Figure – that the states are indeed not
all the same: there are real, measurable things that would be different in the three
different cases.
For example, if we prepare a large ensemble of particle pairs in state A, and then
measure their positions, we will always ﬁnd particle 1 on the left and particle 2 on the
right. In particular, note that we will never ﬁnd the two particles in the same place!
Each particle has a distinct position (the same for all elements in the ensemble) and
so the positions of the two particles are perfectly correlated.
If we instead prepare a large ensemble of particle pairs in state B and then measure
their positions, we will ﬁnd that particle 1 is found on the left half the time and on the
right half the time, and the same for particle 2, and the positions of the two particles
are totally uncorrelated: 25% of the time we will ﬁnd both particles on the left, 25%
of the time we will ﬁnd particle 1 on the left and particle 2 on the right, 25% of the

space where the wave function is nonzero.) In the state ψA, particle 1 is on the left (x1 ≈0) and
particle 2 is on the right (x2 ≈d). In the state ψB, both particles are “smeared” between being on
the left and on the right. State ψC, ﬁnally, is a superposition of “particle 1 is on the left and particle
2 is on the right” and “particle 1 is on the right and particle 2 is on the left”

5.4 Schrödinger’s Suggestion for a Density in 3-Space
133
time we will ﬁnd particle 1 on the right and particle 2 on the left, and 25% of the
time we will ﬁnd both particles on the right.
And things are different yet again if we now prepare a large ensemble of particle
pairs in state C and measure their positions. It is again the case (as with state B)
that particle 1 is found half of the time on the left and half of the time on the right,
and the same is again true for particle 2 as well, but now the positions are perfectly
correlated: whenever particle 1 is found on the right, particle 2 is found on the left,
and vice versa. The particles are somehow deﬁnitely in different places, even though
neither particle has a deﬁnite location!
Now,forourpurposeshere,whatisinterestingaboutallthisisthefollowing.These
three genuinely different, empirically distinguishable quantum states all produce the
exact same charge distribution according to Eq.(5.26). That is, the “physical reality”
of these three states – if Schrödinger’s early idea about how to interpret the physical
meaning of the wave function is correct – is the same. But this, I submit, simply
cannot be correct. The three states are different – physically different – as proved by
the fact that the outcome statistics for various kinds of measurements are different
for the three states.
And so, it seems, Schrödinger’s idea cannot be correct, or at least cannot be
the whole story. It provides a nice way of understanding how the wave function (on
conﬁguration space) might describe some kind of material stuff in three-dimensional
physical space. But, in mathematical terms, one loses a lot of information by “project-
ing down” the wave function  into the charge density ﬁeld ρ. The correspondence,
that is, is many-to-one in the sense that there are very different – and meaningfully
different, physically different – wave functions that correspond to the same charge
density. So Schrödinger’s suggestion is a nice try, and as we will see in later chapters
it has a role to play in some more sophisticated candidate theories, but it apparently
cannot just be the case that Schrödinger’s charge density ρ is, all alone, the ontology
of the world described by quantum mechanics.
5.5
So Then What?
The obvious follow-up question to the previous sentence would be: “OK, so if quan-
tum mechanical wave functions aren’t really, or aren’t just, descriptions of something
like Schrödinger’s charge density ρ, what are they descriptions of?” You would prob-
ably therefore expect this next section to start introducing some other possible ideas,
for the ontology of the quantum world, one of which maybe turns out to be right, or
at least viable. But unfortunately I don’t know of any other possible ideas. If there is
some other way of taking quantum mechanical wave functions seriously, as some-
how more or less directly describing some kind of ﬁeld or ﬁelds in regular physical
space, I don’t know about it.
Well, actually, there is another idea on this issue that is sometimes suggested.
I think it is based on a confusion, and is not viable at all, but perhaps it is worth
mentioning here if only to pre-empt ongoing confusion. The idea is that the ontology

134
5
The Ontology Problem
problem somehow magically goes away when we remember that our best current
theory is not non-relativistic quantum mechanics but rather quantum ﬁeld theory
(QFT). The idea is that, perhaps unlike non-relativistic quantum mechanics (NRQM),
QFT provides a straightforward and obvious and unproblematic ontology, namely,
one of ﬁelds (in physical space).
Butthisissimplynottrue.Fieldswithdeﬁniteconﬁgurationsplayexactlythesame
role in QFT that particles with (for example) deﬁnite positions play in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics. That is, it is possible, in QFT, to write down a quantum state
which can be interpreted as describing a ﬁeld with a deﬁnite conﬁguration, just as it is
possible, in NRQM, to write down a quantum state (namely, a δ function) which can
be interpreted as describing a particle with a deﬁnite position. But just as a generic
quantum state for a single particle in NRQM will not attribute any particular position
to the particle, so a generic quantum state for a ﬁeld in QFT will not attribute any
particular conﬁguration to the ﬁeld. That is, just as a typical quantum state for a single
particle in NRQM can be understood as a superposition over a continuous inﬁnity
of different positions (think ψ(x, t) =

ψ(a, t) δ(x −a) da), so a typical quantum
state for a ﬁeld in QFT can be understood as a superposition over a continuous
inﬁnity of different ﬁeld conﬁgurations. So unless one openly rejects the idea that
quantum states provide complete state descriptions and adopts a naive (and, of course,
ultimately untenable) “ignorance interpretation” of quantum states one simply cannot
claim that QFT describes ﬁelds which always possess deﬁnite conﬁgurations.
There are several reasons for confusion about this. One is that, in the way that
QFT is traditionally presented, one does not typically deal with generic quantum
states, but instead focuses almost exclusively on (asymptotic) initial and ﬁnal states
corresponding to various incoming or outgoing particles in a scattering experiment,
and, in a certain sense, these states can be understood in terms of ﬁelds with deﬁnite
conﬁgurations. The analog in NRQM would be focusing on calculating the proba-
bility that, if a particle starts at a certain position x0 at t = 0, it will be detected at
some other position x f at t = T . One can see why focusing exclusively on this kind
of case might reinforce the belief that it is perfectly viable to think that, according to
quantum mechanics, particles always have deﬁnite positions. A similar thing is hap-
pening when people get the idea that QFT is just unproblematically about ﬁelds (in
physical space) with evolving, but always unproblematically deﬁnite, conﬁgurations.
A second and deeper reason for the confusion, though, is just that most people
have not really thought carefully about these kinds of issues, even in the context of
NRQM. Perhaps they tend to think exclusively about one-particle examples, and so
have in mind an ontology of single-particle waves running around through physical
space. Or perhaps they do hold some naive version of the “ignorance interpretation”,
according to which the ontology is something like classical (i.e., literal) particles,
with wave functions providing only some kind of very incomplete description of
their states. Or perhaps they don’t have any particular ontological picture in mind,
but are instead happy to just play games with mathematical symbols without thinking
about (and without even acknowledging that someone should think about) what the
symbols correspond to in physical reality. In any case, and whatever the ultimate
reasons, most physicists have simply not appreciated or accepted that there is some

5.5 So Then What?
135
problem associated with understanding what NRQM wave functions might describe
exactly – and so they are open to the (in fact rather ridiculous) suggestion that there
is deﬁnitely no such problem in quantum ﬁeld theory.
So where does that leave us? If, as “realist” and literal-minded physicists like
Einstein and Schrödinger seem to have assumed, the idea of quantum mechanics
providing complete descriptions of physical states means that in some sense physical
reality “looks exactly like” wave functions, that view seems very difﬁcult to main-
tain. The measurement problem shows that wave functions (obeying Schrödinger’s
equation all the time) seem unable to capture the deﬁnite outcomes that we always
observe in measurements; Einstein et al. pointed out that the assumption of complete-
ness appears to generate a direct conﬂict with the idea of relativistic local causality;
and now we have seen that even leaving these other worries aside it is simply not clear
how one might regard wave functions as directly and faithfully describing a three-
dimensional physical reality at all, since wave functions are (in general) functions
on an abstract, multi-dimensional conﬁguration space.
As mentioned before, we will return to some of the ideas of this chapter when
we study Everett’s many-worlds version of quantum theory in Chap.10, and also
when we study the so-called “spontaneous collapse” theories in Chap.9. We will
also encounter, in Chap.7, another candidate version of quantum theory according
to which wave functions alone are not the whole story and which attempt to give
perfectly clear descriptions of physical processes in three-dimensional space in terms
of the thing that is postulated to exist in addition to the wave function. But before
turning to those alternative theories, we will explore, in the next chapter, the so-
called “Copenhagen interpretation” and try to understand better the point of view that
people like Einstein and Schrödinger were reacting against when they complained
that a coherent description of micro-physical reality was needed, but not provided
by ordinary quantum mechanics.

may not!) have seen before. Put it in more familiar terms by using ⃗F =
⃗E + ic ⃗B to re-express it in terms of ⃗E and ⃗B, and interpret the result. (Hint:

what does this correspond to in regular non-relativistic quantum mechanics?
(If you’re not sure, you could follow the same procedure and see what happens:
multiply Schrödinger’s equation by ∗, then multiply the complex conjugate
of Schrödinger’s equation by , then subtract and simplify...)
5.4 Consider the two-particle entangled state given in Eq.(5.21). Draw a conﬁgu-
ration space cartoon showing the regions of the two-dimensional conﬁguration
space where this state has nonzero intensity.
5.5 Consider the “Einstein’s Boxes” scenario from the point of view of
Schrödinger’s suggested interpretation of ψ in terms of charge density. In par-
ticular, suppose an electron is “split” between two well-separated half-boxes.
What is its electric charge density? What is the electric charge density after the
half-boxes are opened and the electron is found (complete!) in one half-box or
the other? Explain, ﬁnally, how one can apply Bell’s formulation of “locality”
to diagnose this theoretical description as non-local.
5.6 Consider a case of measurement (described quantum mechanically) from the
point of view of Schrödinger’s suggested interpretation of ψ. Take the exam-
ple from Chap.3: a one-dimensional particle-in-a-box in a superposition of
energy eigenstates has its energy measured and recorded in the ﬁnal posi-
tion of a “pointer” so that the ﬁnal quantum state is the right hand side of
Eq.(5.17). Calculate and sketch a picture of the electric charge density after
the measurement interaction.
5.7 Maybe,insteadofaddingupalltheone-particlechargedensitiesfromEq.(5.25)
to get the total charge density of Eq.(5.26), we should instead regard each par-
ticle’s individual charge density ρi as physically real. (Physical reality, on this
view, would not consist of just one undifferentiated total charge density, but
would instead involve distinct charge densities for each particle.) Does this
view survive the argument made in Sect.5.4? In particular, are the “physical
realities” implied by the three states (ψA, ψB, and ψC) all the same on this
view?
5.8 Interview one of your other physics teachers and ask her whether she agrees
with Bohr that the wave function provides a complete description of quantum
systems. (She will probably say yes, but you never know.) Then ask her to
elaborate by explaining, for the case of the electron in a Hydrogen atom in

137
the ground state, how she pictures the electron. (Presumably she will describe
something like the “cloud” picture implied by taking |ψ|2 as a density-of-stuff,
but, again, you never know.) Finally ask her how to understand what physical
reality is described by an entangled two-particle state like the one in Eq.(5.21).
Summarize her viewpoint.
5.9 In a nice historical paper on “Schrödinger’s route to wave mechanics” [5] Linda
Wessels explains that “In the case of a single classical particle ψ could be inter-
preted as a wave function describing a matter wave. For a system of n classical
particles, however, ψ was a function of 3n spatial coordinates and therefore
described a wave in a 3n-dimensional space that could not be identiﬁed with
ordinary physical space. To give his theory a wave interpretation Schrödinger
would either have to show how the ψ in 3n-dimensional space determined n
waves in 3-dimensional space, or reformulate the theory so that it would yield
directly the required n wave functions.” She then adds, citing a 1962 interview
with Carl Eckart conducted by John Heilbron: “The obvious solution would
be to rewrite the equations of wave mechanics so that even for a system of sev-
eral ‘particles’, only three-dimensional wave functions would be determined.
C. Eckart has reported that at one time he attempted this and remarked that
it was something that initially ‘everybody’ was trying to do.” (Emphasis
added.) It might be a little intimidating to know that “everybody” tried some-
thing already, and nobody succeeded... but how hard can it be, really? See
if you can come up with some other way or ways to convert Schrödinger’s
(x1, x2, . . . , xN) into N “single particle” waves. Test your ideas out on exam-
ples like the one from Sect.5.4.
5.10 In one version of the EPR-type argument we discussed in the previous chapter,
Einstein pointed out that if “completeness” means a one-to-one correspon-
dencebetweenphysicallyrealstatesandquantumwavefunctions,then(assum-
ing locality!) QM is not complete. One could also summarize the discussion
of Sect.5.4 by saying that there is a failure of one-to-one correspondence
between physical states (as understood according to Schrödinger’s sugges-
tion) and wave functions. (Namely: the three different wave functions dis-
cussed there would all correspond to the same one physical state.) Compare
and contrast these two different applications of the “one-to-one correspon-
dence” idea. What exactly is being argued for in the two cases and how do the
arguments relate?
5.11 Consider the two electrons in a diatomic Hydrogen molecule. What exactly do
chemists and physicists think the two electrons are doing, and how does this
relate to their joint wave function? For example, ﬁnd a “picture” of a Hydrogen
molecule in a chemistry or physics book (or online). (Or interview a physicist
or chemist, and ask them to draw a Hydrogen molecule.) What exactly is
pictured? Is it Schrödinger’s early suggestion? Something else? Summarize
and explain.
5.12 One weird idea that has been suggested, as a way of dealing with “the ontol-
ogy problem”, is to take the 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space seriously, as
the fundamental physical space. (Evidently N here should be what we would

138
5
The Ontology Problem
ordinarily think of as the total number of particles in the universe.) Then there is
no longer any problem understanding how the wave function could directly and
faithfully and completely describe what’s real. On this view, physical reality
would consist of something like a (complex valued) ﬁeld (or maybe two cou-
pled real-valued ﬁelds!) in this 3N-dimensional space. The three-dimensional
world would then be somehow “emergent” from this more basic reality. What
do you think of this idea?
5.13 It was mentioned at the end of Sect.5.4 that one of Schrödinger’s reasons for
abandoning his early suggestion (about the physical meaning of ) had to
do with the inevitable spreading-out of wave packets we ﬁrst encountered in
Chap.2. But, you might wonder, isn’t (for example) the electron in a Hydrogen
atom bound? Won’t its wave function remain forever localized around the
proton without spreading? So... is there really a problem with spreading, or
not? (Hint: consider both the electron and the proton in the Hydrogen atom.
A complete answer will involve constructing an explicit one-dimensional toy
model of a Hydrogen atom and depicting the time-evolution of its quantum
state in the two-dimensional conﬁguration space.) What if the Hydrogen atom
is bound to some other atoms in a molecule?
5.14 Show that, as claimed in the text, the “three genuinely different, empirically
distinguishable quantum states [ψA, ψB, and ψC] all produce the exact same
charge distribution according to Eq. (5.26).”
5.15 The main conclusion of Sect.5.4 was that Schrödinger’s charge density ontol-
ogy cannot be correct, or at least cannot be the whole story. Maybe supple-
menting the charge density with some additional properties would do the trick?
What sort of thing would you need to add to the ontology to give appropriate
physical differences between the states described by ψA, ψB, and ψC?
5.16 Two particles of identical charge q are in the same length-L box, in the entan-
gled state
ψ(x1, x2) =
1
√
2
[ψ1(x1) ψ2(x2) + i ψ3(x1) ψ1(x2)]
(5.35)
where the ψns are the usual particle-in-a-box energy eigenstates. According
to Schrödinger’s early suggestion about the physical meaning of the wave
function, Eq. (5.25), what is the charge density ρ1(x) associated with particle
1? Calculate it explicitly. Will ρ1(x) change in time?
5.17 Consider the following version of (something like) the EPR argument:
A pair of spatially-separated particles is in the entangled spin state
 =
1
√
2

ψ1
+zψ2
−z −ψ1
−zψ2
+z

.
(5.36)
If one measures the spin (say, along the z-direction) of particle 1, the two particle state
will, according to QM, collapse – either to ψ1
+zψ2
−z or to ψ1
−zψ2
+z. That is, after and
as a result of the measurement on particle 1, the spin state of particle 2 will become
either ψ2
+z or ψ2
−z. But prior to the measurement the spin state of particle 2 was neither

5.5 So Then What?
139
of these. Therefore, the spin state of particle 2 has been (non-locally) affected by the
measurement on (the distant) particle 1.
What, from the point of view of the issue raised in this chapter, is not quite
right about this argument? Do you think that the not-quite-right-ness of this
argument suggests that, contra EPR, QM is actually a local theory? Explain.
5.18 What is “the ontology problem”? Summarize in your own words.

Chapter 6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is the set of ideas, about how
the theory should be understood, that was chieﬂy developed by Niels Bohr in collab-
oration with various colleagues, most notably Werner Heisenberg, in the 1920s and
1930s. Bohr’s philosophy rapidly achieved the status of a kind of orthodoxy within
the physics community, with early dissenters (such as Einstein and Schrödinger)
being typically dismissed with charges of senility, and occasional critics from later
decades (such as Bohm and Bell and Everett) being regarded practically as heretics,
sinners against the true and proper nature of science. It became commonplace for
proponents of the Copenhagen interpretation to insist that there was, in fact, no log-
ically viable alternative to it at all, and authors of quantum mechanics textbooks
continue, to the present day, to pay universal (if typically brief) lip service to Bohr’s
philosophy.
All of that said, however, the question of what, precisely, the Copenhagen inter-
pretation says is surprisingly controversial. It has been joked that there are as many
different versions of the Copenhagen interpretation as there are physicists who claim
to follow it, and even scholars who study Bohr’s writings in detail tend to come up
with radically different interpretations of what he says and means. And yet, despite
this unclarity, there is somehow nevertheless a fairly clear dichotomy between Bohr’s
actual views (whatever they were exactly) and the shallow, pragmatic version of them
that students typically absorb from their textbooks and teachers.
The present chapter therefore begins with a rather long “guided tour” of several
of the most relevant and important papers by Bohr and Heisenberg, so that readers
can start to develop some direct acquaintance with their actual views. In the middle
part of the chapter, we look at Bohr’s analysis of several thought experiments that
Einstein had proposed by way of criticizing the Copenhagen approach. Only then,
toward the end of the chapter, will we step back and discuss (more brieﬂy) the typical
contemporary understanding of the Copenhagen interpretation, and how it is viewed
by both its proponents and its critics.

The Copenhagen Interpretation
6.1
Bohr’s Como Lecture
Bohr’s “Como Lecture” was ﬁrst delivered at a celebration for Alexander Volta in
Como, Italy, in the fall of 1927 and was subsequently published in Nature the follow-
ing year [1]. Its actual title was “The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development
of Atomic Theory” and it provides an illuminating summary of Bohr’s philosophical
interpretation of the ﬁrst several years of the development of quantum mechanics.
Bohr cuts right to the chase in the ﬁrst paragraph:
The quantum theory is characterised by the acknowledgment of a fundamental limitation in
the classical physical ideas when applied to atomic phenomena. The situation thus created
is of a peculiar nature, since our interpretation of the experimental material rests essentially
upon the classical concepts. Notwithstanding the difﬁculties which hence are involved in
the formulation of the quantum theory, it seems, as we shall see, that its essence may be
expressed in the so-called quantum postulate, which attributes to any atomic process an
essential discontinuity, or rather individuality, completely foreign to the classical theories
and symbolized by Planck’s quantum of action [1].
Already here we see a central theme of Bohr’s Copenhagen philosophy, concerning
the tension between (i) the supposed necessity of our continuing to use “the classical
concepts” and (ii) the limitations of these concepts in capturing the uniquely quantum
processes. Bohr elaborates in the following paragraph:
This [quantum] postulate implies a renunciation as regards the causal space-time co-
ordination of atomic processes. Indeed, our usual description of physical phenomena is
based entirely on the idea that the phenomena concerned may be observed without disturb-
ing them appreciably. This appears, for example, clearly in the theory of relativity, which
has been so fruitful for the elucidation of the classical theories. As emphasised by Einstein,
every observation or measurement ultimately rests on the coincidence of two independent
events at the same space-time point. Just these coincidences will not be affected by any dif-
ferences which the space-time co-ordination of different observers otherwise may exhibit.
Now the quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve
an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an indepen-
dent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to
the agencies of observation. After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it
depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed. Ultimately every
observation can of course be reduced to our sense perceptions. The circumstance, however,
that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions, entails
that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at what point the concept of
observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent ‘irrationality’ is brought in [1].
I would summarize this by saying that, according to Bohr, our everyday, classical
notions of external physical reality (for example, assigning deﬁnite “states” to various
objects, talking about the causal interactions of objects in space and time, etc.) tacitly
rely on the assumption that the act of observation can be taken as having no (or at
least negligible) inﬂuence on the objects being observed. Whereas, in the quantum
realm, “observation ... will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not
to be neglected.” The act of observation, in short, disturbs the state of the observed
object in an ineliminable and unpredictable way, thus rendering it impossible to
acquire knowledge of the (pre-existing, undisturbed) state of the object and, indeed,

6.1 Bohr’s Como Lecture
143
thereby rendering talk of such “pre-existing states” empirically meaningless. We
must therefore take a more holistic perspective on the broader system comprising
both the “observer” and the “observed system” and recognize that any sharp division
between them (such as would be implied in analyzing the interaction in terms of
separate systems, each with its own well-deﬁned state, interacting) is an arbitrary
construct – one which we perhaps cannot avoid imposing in discussing and reporting
our observations, but one which nevertheless in some fundamental sense distorts the
real situation.
The overall line of reasoning here resonates with a general philosophical frame-
work (that was quite popular at the time) called “positivism” (and/or sometimes the
closely-related idea of “operationalism”), one of whose essential points was the idea
that meaningful assertions must be veriﬁable by direct observation. To use a slightly
silly and unfair example, just to try to clarify the idea, a positivist might claim that it is
literally meaningless to speculate about what happens to the light inside your refrig-
erator when the door is closed. Since there is (or rather: assuming it was somehow
the case that there is) no way to observe how light or dark it is inside the refrigerator
when the door is shut (because observing this requires opening the door!), it is liter-
ally meaningless to even speculate about it, and any such speculative talk should be
dismissed from rational scientiﬁc discourse as worthless and “metaphysical”.
Bohr’s perspective here also recalls that of the famous 18th century German
philosopher, Immanuel Kant, who inﬂuentially argued that we are fundamentally
cut off from true (so-called “noumenal”) reality because, in effect, our minds are
hard-wired to categorize the incoming sensory information in certain ways. We are
thus aware, by ordinary means, only of the so-called “phenomenal” world – i.e.,
the world of appearances, of things-as-processed-by-us whose true natures must
remain forever inaccessible. One commentator, Henry Krips, has suggested that
Bohr can be understood as continuing a trend initiated by 19th century thinkers who
“physiologiz[ed] the Kantian conception of observation” by locating the supposedly
distorting process not in the mind, but in the physiology of perception. According to
Krips,
Bohr extended this position by proposing that the ‘external procedures’ that affect the forms
of sensible intuition include the processes of observation themselves. Thus Bohr stood at the
end of a long historical trajectory: Kant conceived the apparatus of observation as an inner
mental faculty, analogous to a pair of spectacles that mediated and in particular gave form
to and interpreted raw sense impressions. Neo-Kantians projected the interpretative aspect
of vision outwards, reconceiving it as a bodily, and speciﬁcally physiological process. Bohr
took this further by including observation as [affecting] not merely what we see but also the
terms in which we describe it [2].
In any case, though, and whatever the historical precedents, for Bohr the fundamental
lesson of the quantum theory was that there is a kind of inherent “graininess” and
unpredictability to interactions, including the interactions between “external object
and “observer” (or “measuring apparatus”). Such interactions supposedly imply a
ﬁnite, non-negligible, and uncontrollable disturbance, of the “external object”, when-
ever we try to observe it. And so we are cut off from the possibility of scientiﬁcally
meaningful descriptions of the microscopic world, for just the same reasons that (in

144
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
the silly example of the last paragraph) we are cut off from scientiﬁcally meaningful
descriptions of the state of illumination inside a closed refrigerator: the very act of
trying to verify any hypothesis about the state of the object in question, disturbs its
state and thereby undercuts the attempted veriﬁcation. This is why Bohr speaks of a
“renunciation” of the applicability of our classical concepts.
Bohr continues to explain that
This situation has far-reaching consequences. On one hand, the deﬁnition of the state of a
physical system, as ordinarily understood, claims the elimination of all external disturbances.
But in that case, according to the quantum postulate, any observation will be impossible,
and, above all, the concepts of space and time lose their immediate sense. On the other hand,
if in order to make observation possible we permit certain interactions with suitable agen-
cies of measurement, not belonging to the system, an unambiguous deﬁnition of the state of
the system is naturally no longer possible, and there can be no question of causality in the
ordinary sense of the word. The very nature of the quantum theory thus forces us to regard
the space-time co-ordination and the claim of causality, the union of which characterises the
classical theories, as complementary but exclusive features of the description, symbolising
the idealisation of observation and deﬁnition respectively. Just as the relativity theory has
taught us that the convenience of distinguishing sharply between space and time rests solely
on the smallness of the velocities ordinarily met with compared to the velocity of light,
we learn from the quantum theory that the appropriateness of our usual causal space-time
description depends entirely upon the small value of the quantum of action as compared
to the actions involved in ordinary sense perceptions. Indeed, in the description of atomic
phenomena, the quantum postulate presents us with the task of developing a ‘complemen-
tarity’ theory the consistency of which can be judged only by weighing the possibilities of
deﬁnition and observation [1].
Here we ﬁrst encounter Bohr’s fundamental concept of “complementarity”. In this
paragraph, he describes, as “complementary”, the causal and space-time perspectives
on events. His point is that, whereas in the context of classical physics it is taken
for granted that both perspectives are simultaneously applicable and indeed classical
descriptions by deﬁnition provide causal accounts of spatio-temporal events, the two
perspectives are mutually exclusive in the quantum realm. Meaningful attribution
of precise spatial and temporal coordinates to events requires, for example, careful
position measurements. But such measurements, as we have seen, imply physical
interactions which disrupt the causal processes which might otherwise, in the absence
of said interactions, have been taking place.
For Bohr, the “causal” description means one taking account of energy and
momentum conservation. So the “complementarity” between space-time and causal
descriptions arises speciﬁcally from the fact that position measurements imply an
interaction involving unpredictable momentum exchange between the system in
question and the position-measuring apparatus. One thus sees an intimate connection
(which we will continue to explore as this chapter develops) between Bohr’s view
that “space-time” and “causal” descriptions are mutually exclusive, and Heisenberg’s
important discovery that position and momentum (as well as time and energy) jointly
obey an uncertainty (or indeterminacy) principle.
Bohr saw a similar sort of complementarity between the wave and particle pictures
of light (and, subsequently, electrons), controversy about which had given rise to
quantum mechanics in the ﬁrst place:

6.1 Bohr’s Como Lecture
145
This view is already clearly brought out by the much-discussed question of the nature of light
and the ultimate constituents of matter. As regards light, its propagation in space and time is
adequately expressed by the electromagnetic theory. Especially the interference phenomena
in vacuo and the optical properties of material media are completely governed by the wave
theory superposition principle. Nevertheless, the conservation of energy and momentum
during the interaction between radiation and matter, as evident in the photoelectric and
Compton effect, ﬁnds its adequate expression just in the light quantum idea put forward by
Einstein. As is well known, the doubts regarding the validity of the superposition principle on
the one hand and of the conservation laws on the other, which were suggested by this apparent
contradiction, have been deﬁnitely disproved through direct experiments. This situation
would seem clearly to indicate the impossibility of a causal space-time description of the
light phenomena. On one hand, in attempting to trace the laws of the time-spatial propagation
of light according to the quantum postulate, we are conﬁned to statistical considerations.
On the other hand, the fulﬁlment of the claim of causality for the individual light processes,
characterised by the quantum of action, entails a renunciation as regards the space-time
description. Of course, there can be no question of a quite independent application of the
ideas of space and time and of causality. The two views of the nature of light are rather to be
considered as different attempts at an interpretation of experimental evidence in which the
limitation of the classical concepts is expressed in complementary ways.
The problem of the nature of the constituents of matter presents us with an analogous
situation. The individuality of the elementary electrical corpuscles is forced upon us by
general evidence. Nevertheless, recent experience, above all the discovery of the selective
reﬂection of electrons from metal crystals, requires the use of the wave theory superposition
principle in accordance with the ideas of L. de Broglie. Just as in the case of light, we
have consequently in the question of the nature of matter, so far as we adhere to classical
concepts, to face an inevitable dilemma, which has to be regarded as the very expression of
experimental evidence. In fact, here again we are not dealing with contradictory but with
complementary pictures of the phenomena, which only together offer a natural generalisation
of the classical mode of description. In the discussion of these questions, it must be kept
in mind that, according to the view taken above, radiation in free space as well as isolated
material particles are abstractions, their properties on the quantum theory being deﬁnable and
observable only through their interaction with other systems. Nevertheless, these abstractions
are, as we shall see, indispensable for a description of experimental evidence in connexion
with our ordinary space-time view [1].
Here Bohr stresses that each side of the wave-particle duality has a secure foundation
in experimental evidence: for light, for example, the continuous space-time propa-
gation as described by Maxwell’s equations is required to account for interference
phenomena, whereas Einstein’s “light quantum” (i.e., “light particle” or “photon”)
picture is necessary to account for phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and
Compton scattering. Bohr’s view seems to be that if we take either picture too seri-
ously – i.e., if we take either picture as capturing, fully and ﬁnally, the true physical
nature of light – we would have a clear contradiction with some aspect of the exper-
imental evidence which can only be described by the alternative picture. So, for
Bohr, we must not take either picture fully seriously: the contradiction is merely
“apparent”. Yet, simultaneously, we must take both pictures quite seriously, in the
sense that only together do they allow us to understand the totality of experimental
evidence. The two pictures, that is, are mutually exclusive (in the sense that, taken
as capturing the full truth, they contradict one another) and yet jointly exhaustive
(in the sense that we need both, together, to capture all aspects of the phenomena
revealed by observation).

The Copenhagen Interpretation
It is interesting, here, to compare Bohr’s view with another possible interpretation
of the wave-particle duality. Einstein, for example, considered (during this same
period) a “pilot-wave” model of photons, in which the wave-particle “duality” is
taken quite literally: each individual “photon” in this model consists of a literal
point particle (carrying the energy) which is guided (or piloted) by a surrounding
wave obeying Maxwell’s equations. We will explore this type of model further (but
for massive particles rather than photons) in Chap.7. For now, the point is just
that there seem to exist various ways that one might consider really reconciling –
unifying – the aspects that Bohr considers “complementary”. Doing this of course
requires modifying the classical concepts. For example, in this pilot-wave model of
photons, there is still a wave obeying Maxwell’s equations, but its role is completely
different – instead of actually being the seat of light’s energy and momentum, it
is a kind of behind-the-scenes “ghost”, pushing and pulling the associated photon
particle.1 And similarly, although there is a particle with a deﬁnite trajectory, it does
not obey the familiar dynamical laws of Newtonian mechanics, but instead something
completely novel which gives rise to all sorts of unexpected and surprising motions
(e.g., when a photon reﬂects from a mirror, the particle stops and sits still for some
time some distance in front of the mirror!). In any case, this example illustrates, I
think, the attitude that people like Einstein and Schrödinger had toward the “apparent
contradiction” Bohr mentions here. They, like Bohr, saw the conﬂicts as pointing
to inadequacies in the existing models. But they took for granted that it should
be possible to build new theories – new pictures of microscopic reality with new
associated dynamical laws – that would unify and explain all available experimental
evidence.
But Bohr would have none of this. For Bohr, the classical models may be “abstrac-
tions” (whose domain of applicability we stretch when we use them to describe
the microscopic world), but they are necessary – almost “hard-wired” in a kind of
Kantian sense – abstractions that can not and/or should not be abandoned, modiﬁed,
or replaced. For Bohr, the quantum theory was not so much an attempt to accurately
describe microscopic reality (this being supposedly impossible, for the philosophical
reasons we have been sketching) but was rather a formal and precise mathematical
scheme to referee disputes between complementary (i.e., individually inadequate but
still jointly necessary) perspectives.
Here again the Heisenberg uncertainty relations are crucial and central. As Bohr
explains,
...in the classical theories any succeeding observation permits a prediction of future events
with ever-increasing accuracy, because it improves our knowledge of the initial state of the
system. According to the quantum theory, just the impossibility of neglecting the interaction
with the agency of measurement means that every observation introduces a new uncontrol-
lable element. Indeed, it follows from the above considerations that the measurement of
the positional coordinates of a particle is accompanied not only by a ﬁnite change in the
dynamical variables, but also the ﬁxation of its position means a complete rupture in the
causal description of its dynamical behaviour, while the determination of its momentum
always implies a gap in the knowledge of its spatial propagation. Just this situation brings
1Einstein literally called it a “Gespensterfeld”, ghost-ﬁeld.

6.1 Bohr’s Como Lecture

out most strikingly the complementary character of the description of atomic phenomena
which appears as an inevitable consequence of the contrast between the quantum postulate
and the distinction between object and agency of measurement, inherent in our very idea of
observation [1].
We will hear more about the connection between the uncertainty principle and the
Copenhagen interpretation from Heisenberg himself, in the following section.
Before turning to that, however, here is one last excerpt from Bohr’s Como lecture,
in which he discusses Schrödinger’s wave mechanics and echoes some of the issues
we reviewed in the previous chapter:
...Schrödinger has expressed the hope that the development of the wave theory will eventually
remove the irrational element expressed by the quantum postulate and open the way for a
complete description of atomic phenomena along the line of the classical theories. In support
of this view, Schrödinger, in a recent paper (...) emphasises the fact that the discontinuous
exchange of energy between atoms required by the quantum postulate, from the point of view
of the wave theory, is replaced by a simple resonance phenomenon. In particular, the idea of
individual stationary states would be an illusion and its applicability only an illustration of
the resonance mentioned. It must be kept in mind, however, that just in the resonance problem
mentioned we are concerned with a closed system which, according to the view presented
here, is not accessible to observation. In fact, wave mechanics ... represents a symbolic
transcription of the problem of motion of classical mechanics adapted to the requirements
of quantum theory and only to be interpreted by an explicit use of the quantum postulate. ....
The symbolical character of Schrödinger’s method appears not only from the circumstance
that its simplicity ... depends essentially upon the use of imaginary arithmetic quantities. But
above all there can be no question of an immediate connexion with our ordinary conceptions
because the ‘geometrical’ problem represented by the wave equation is associated with
the so-called co-ordinate [i.e., conﬁguration] space, the number of dimensions of which
is equal to the number of degrees of freedom of the system, and hence in general greater
than the number of dimensions of ordinary space. Further, Schrödinger’s formulation of the
interaction problem ... involves a neglect of the ﬁnite velocity of propagation of the forces
claimed by relativity theory.
On the whole, it would scarcely seem justiﬁable, in the case of the interaction problem, to
demand a visualisation by means of ordinary space-time pictures. In fact, all our knowledge
concerning the internal properties of atoms is derived from experiments on their radiation
or collision reactions, such that the interpretation of experimental facts ultimately depends
on the abstractions of radiation in free space, and free material particles. Hence, our whole
space-time view of physical phenomena, as well as the deﬁnition of energy and momentum,
depends ultimately upon these abstractions. In judging the applications of these auxiliary
ideas we should only demand inner consistency, in which connexion special regard has to
be paid to the possibilities of deﬁnition and observation [1].
Bohr’s description of Schrödinger’s waves as “symbolical” – on (largely) the grounds
that, as waves in conﬁguration space, the wave functions clearly cannot be taken seri-
ously as physically real – is particularly interesting. It should be becoming clear that,
whatever exactly Bohr and his colleagues may have meant when they made claims
implying the completeness of the quantum mechanical description, it was not exactly
the same kind of thing that Einstein and Schrödinger meant by this same word, and

148

The Copenhagen Interpretation
against which their objections were made.2 For Bohr and the other Copenhagenists,
the completeness of quantum mechanics did not mean that the theory provides a
literal and direct and exhaustive description of the physical states of external objects.
Indeed, as we have seen, for Bohr, the essential lesson of quantum theory is precisely
that such an exhaustive description is, for supposedly deep philosophical reasons,
impossible to achieve and thus inappropriate to seek. For Bohr, “completeness” is
usedinsteadinanepistemologicalorsemanticsense(ratherthantherealistordescrip-
tive sense we have largely assumed in earlier chapters) – something less along the
lines of “no aspect of objective reality has been missed” and instead more along
the lines of “you can’t rationally ask for anything more (than this formal refereeing
between the complementary classical concepts) without lapsing into meaningless,
unscientiﬁc, metaphysical talk”.
This point of view will become somewhat clearer when we review Bohr’s analysis
of some concrete examples. But ﬁrst let’s consider the Copenhagen interpretation as
explained by its second-most-important proponent, Werner Heisenberg.
6.2
Heisenberg
In Heisenberg’s writings, one ﬁnds an overall agreement with the perspectives of
Bohr. But Heisenberg is a little simpler and a little more practical – a little less
careful and a lot less philosophically grandiose – in his way of expressing himself.
Let us begin here by giving the overall ﬂavor of Heisenberg’s style by quoting,
“rapid-ﬁre,” some excerpts from his essay on “The History of Quantum Theory” [4]:
• “... from this time on ... the physicists learned to ask the right questions.... What
were these questions? Practically all of them had to do with the strange apparent
contradictions between the results of different experiments. How could it be that
the same radiation that produces interference patterns, and therefore must consist
of waves, also produces the photoelectric effect, and therefore must consist of
particles? How could it be that the frequency of the orbital motion of the electron
in the atom does not show up in the frequency of the emitted radiation? .... Again
and again one found that the attempts to describe atomic events in the traditional
terms of physics led to contradictions.”
• “Gradually, during the early twenties, the physicists became accustomed to these
difﬁculties, they acquired a certain vague knowledge about where trouble would
occur, and they learned to avoid contradictions. .... This was not sufﬁcient to form
a consistent general picture of what happens in a quantum process, but it changed
the minds of the physicists in such a way that they somehow got into the spirit of
quantum theory.”
2The “completeness” claim was made at least as early as 1927 when Max Born and Heisenberg
declared: “We maintain that quantum mechanics is a complete theory; its basic physical and math-
ematical hypotheses are not further susceptible of modiﬁcations” [3].

6.2 Heisenberg
149
• “The strangest experience of those years was that the paradoxes of quantum theory
did not disappear during this process of clariﬁcation; on the contrary, they became
even more marked and more exciting.”
• “The two experiments – one on the interference of scattered light and the other on
the change of frequency of the scattered light – seemed to contradict each other
without any possibility of compromise.”
• “But in what sense did the new formalism describe the atom? The paradoxes of
the dualism between wave picture and particle picture were not solved; they were
hidden somehow in the mathematical scheme.”
• “The electromagnetic waves were interpreted not as ‘real’ waves but as probability
waves, the intensity of which determines in every point the probability for the
absorption ... of a light quantum by an atom at this point.”
• “The probability wave ... meant a tendency for something. It was a quantitative
version of the old concept of ‘potentia’ in Aristotelian philosophy. It introduced
something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual
event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and
reality.”
• “Bohr considered the two pictures – particle picture and wave picture – as two
complementary descriptions of the same reality. Any of these descriptions can be
only partially true, there must be limitations to the use of the particle concept as
well as of the wave concept, else one could not avoid contradictions. If one takes
into account those limitations which can be expressed by the uncertainty relations,
the contradictions disappear.”
Leaving aside their very different manners of expression, the biggest difference
between the views of Heisenberg and Bohr is probably on this point of the wave
function (i.e., “probability wave”) representing some kind of at least half- or proto-
real thing. Heisenberg’s view here is much closer to the spirit of the view that, for
example, Einstein had criticized – as seemingly in conﬂict with the principle of
locality – in his “boxes” type arguments. We will return to this point later in the
chapter.
For now, let us turn to one of Heisenberg’s more careful attempts to articulate
the Copenhagen philosophy. The ﬁrst paragraph of his essay (written later, in the
1950s) on “The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory” [5] contains a nice
summary of the ideas we reviewed in the previous section:
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory starts from a paradox. Any experiment in
physics, whether it refers to the phenomena of daily life or to atomic events, is to be described
inthetermsofclassicalphysics.Theconceptsofclassicalphysicsformthelanguagebywhich
we describe the arrangement of our experiments and state the results. We cannot and should
not replace these concepts by any others. Still the application of these concepts is limited by
the relations of uncertainty. We must keep in mind this limited range of applicability of the
classical concepts while using them, but we cannot and should not try to improve them [5].
The last sentence there, to me, captures the essence of the Copenhagen interpretation:
because we must continue to use the classical concepts, even while acknowledging
their limitations, we must in some deep sense renounce the goal of attempting to

150
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
understand and explain quantum phenomena in the clear, consistent, uniﬁed, literal
way that had always been aimed at in “classical” physics.
Heisenberg elaborates his view about the nature of the quantum mechanical wave
function later in the same article:
...it is useful to compare the procedure for the theoretical interpretation of an experiment
in classical physics and in quantum theory. In Newton’s mechanics, for instance, we may
start by measuring the position and the velocity of the planet whose motion we are going to
study. The result of the observation is translated into mathematics by deriving numbers for
the co-ordinates and the momenta of the planet from the observation. Then the equations of
motion are used to derive from these values of the co-ordinates and momenta at a given time
the values of these co-ordinates ... at a later time, and in this way the astronomer can predict
the properties of the system at a later time. He can, for instance, predict the exact time for
an eclipse of the moon.
In quantum theory the procedure is slightly different. We could for instance be interested in
the motion of an electron through a cloud chamber and could determine by some kind of
observation the initial position and velocity of the electron. But this determination will not
be accurate; it will at least contain the inaccuracies following from the uncertainty relations
and will probably contain still larger errors due to the difﬁculty of the experiment. It is
the ﬁrst of these inaccuracies which allows us to translate the result of the observation into
the mathematical scheme of quantum theory. A probability function is written down which
represents the experimental situation at the time of the measurement, including even the
possible errors of the measurement.
This probability function represents a mixture of two things, partly a fact and partly our
knowledge of a fact. It represents a fact in so far as it assigns at the initial time the probability
unity (i.e., complete certainty) to the initial situation: the electron moving with the observed
velocity at the observed position; ‘observed’ means observed within the accuracy of the
experiment. It represents our knowledge in so far as another observer could perhaps know
the position of the electron more accurately. The error in the experiment does – at least to
some extent – not represent a property of the electron but a deﬁciency in our knowledge of
the electron. Also this deﬁciency of knowledge is expressed in the probability function.
In classical physics one should in a careful investigation also consider the error of the
observation. As a result one would get a probability distribution for the initial values of the
co-ordinates and velocities and therefore something very similar to the probability function
in quantum mechanics. Only the necessary uncertainty due to the uncertainty relations is
lacking in classical physics.
When the probability function in quantum theory has been determined at the initial time from
the observation, one can from the laws of quantum theory calculate the probability function at
any later time and can thereby determine the probability for a measurement giving a speciﬁed
value of the measured quantity. We can, for instance, predict the probability for ﬁnding the
electron at a later time at a given point in the cloud chamber. It should be emphasized,
however, that the probability function does not in itself represent a course of events in
the course of time. It represents a tendency for events and our knowledge of events. The
probability function can be connected with reality only if one essential condition is fulﬁlled:
if a new measurement is made to determine a certain property of the system. Only then does
the probability function allow us to calculate the probable result of the new measurement.
The result of the measurement again will be stated in terms of classical physics.
Therefore, the theoretical interpretation of an experiment requires three distinct steps: (1) the
translation of the initial experimental situation into a probability function; (2) the following
up of this function in the course of time; (3) the statement of a new measurement to be made
of the system, the result of which can then be calculated from the probability function. For
the ﬁrst step the fulﬁllment of the uncertainty relations is a necessary condition. The second

6.2 Heisenberg
151
step cannot be described in terms of the classical concepts; there is no description of what
happens to the system between the initial observation and the next measurement. It is only
in the third step that we change over again from the ‘possible’ to the ‘actual’ [5].
This passage raises a number of questions about how Heisenberg’s views relate to
Bohr’s views as well as to the worries discussed in previous chapters. I’ll invite you
to think about some of these issues in the Projects.
Heisenberg’s positivist philosophy is also on display in this essay. For example,
in discussing the idea of electrons orbiting nuclei in atoms, he remarks: “one can
never observe more than one point in the orbit of the electron; therefore, there is
no orbit in the ordinary sense” [5]. What the electron does between observations is
thus dismissed not merely as unknowable (and thus not meaningful to speak of) but
as altogether non-existent. Indeed, this kind of inference – from unknowability to
unreality – pushes beyond mere positivism and recalls the idealist philosophy of,
for example, Bishop George Berkeley, who famously decreed “esse est percipi” –
“to be, is to be perceived”. The extent to which this sort of anti-realism, about (at
least) the microscopic quantum realm, should be considered an ofﬁcial part of the
Copenhagen doctrine, is one of those controversial issues about which there is no
real consensus.
Heisenberg’s continuing elaboration provides an illuminating perspective on
Bohr’s concept of “complementarity”:
Actually we need not speak of particles at all. For many experiments it is more convenient to
speak of matter waves; for instance, of stationary matter waves around the atomic nucleus.
Suchadescriptionwoulddirectlycontradicttheotherdescriptionifonedoesnotpayattention
to the limitations given by the uncertainty relations. Through the limitations the contradiction
is avoided. The use of ‘matter waves’ is convenient, for example, when dealing with the
radiation emitted by the atom. By means of its frequencies and intensities the radiation gives
information about the oscillating charge distribution in the atom, and there the wave picture
comes much nearer to the truth than the particle picture. Therefore, Bohr advocated the use
of both pictures, which he called ‘complementary’ to each other. The two pictures are of
course mutually exclusive, because a certain thing cannot at the same time be a particle (i.e.,
substance conﬁned to a very small volume) and a wave (i.e., a ﬁeld spread out over a large
space), but the two complement each other. By playing with both pictures, by going from
the one picture to the other and back again, we ﬁnally get the right impression of the strange
kind of reality behind our atomic experiments [5].
Once again, not only in the style of the writing, but also in some of the content of
his remarks, one senses that Heisenberg’s understanding of “complementarity” is
a little more easy-going and pragmatic than Bohr’s. For example, one doubts that
Bohr would agree with Heisenberg’s statement that the ‘matter wave’ picture “comes
much nearer to the truth” in its description of the electrons orbiting a nucleus in an
atom. This kind of (perhaps inadvertent) concession to the existence of some “real
truth” about such things leaves Heisenberg, I think, much more open to the kinds of
criticisms we reviewed in the last few chapters. Whereas Bohr’s dense prose functions
more effectively as an impenetrable barrier against such attacks.
Heisenberg returns to the theme of anti-realism (about unobserved microscopic
phenomena) in his comments on the double-slit experiment:

152
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
We assume that a small source of monochromatic light radiates toward a black screen with
two small holes in it. The diameter of the holes may be not much bigger than the wave
length of the light, but their [separation] will be very much bigger. At some distance behind
the screen a photographic plate registers the incident light. If one describes this experiment
in terms of the wave picture, one says that the primary wave penetrates through the two
holes; there will be secondary spherical waves starting from the holes that interfere with one
another, and the interference will produce a pattern of varying intensity on the photographic
plate.
The blackening of the photographic plate is a quantum process, a chemical reaction produced
by a single light quanta. Therefore, it must also be possible to describe the experiment in
terms of light quanta. If it would be permissible to say what happens to the single light
quantum between its emission from the light source and its absorption in the photographic
plate, one could argue as follows: The single light quantum can come through the ﬁrst
hole or through the second one. If it goes through the ﬁrst hole and is scattered there, its
probability for being absorbed at a certain point of the photographic plate cannot depend
upon whether the second hole is closed or open. The probability distribution on the plate will
be the same as if only the ﬁrst hole was open. If the experiment is repeated many times and
one takes together all cases in which the light quantum has gone through the ﬁrst hole, the
blackening of the plate due to these cases will correspond to this probability distribution. If
one considers only those light quanta that go through the second hole, the blackening should
correspond to a probability distribution derived from the assumption that only the second
hole is open. The total blackening, therefore, should just be the sum of the blackenings in
the two cases; in other words, there should be no interference pattern. But we know this is
not correct, and the experiment will show the interference pattern. Therefore, the statement
that any light quantum must have gone either through the ﬁrst or through the second hole is
problematic and leads to contradictions. This example shows clearly that the concept of the
probability function does not allow a description of what happens between two observations.
Any attempt to ﬁnd such a description would lead to contradictions; this must mean that the
term ‘happens’ is restricted to the observation [5].
One may have questions about why, in the case of an electron in an atom, “the wave
picture comes much nearer to the truth”, whereas in the case of a particle traversing a
double-slit apparatus the wave does not in any sense provide a realistic “description
of what happens”. And of course one may also have philosophical concerns about the
idea that nothing happens beyond that which is observed. Here I will just point out
that, in addition to such philosophical concerns, one might also have (to use Bell’s
terminology from Chap.3) “professional” concerns about this idea: if, according to
quantum mechanics, physical reality (what “happens”) is restricted, somehow, to
observation, shouldn’t we insist on a sharp deﬁnition of “observation”, i.e., a clear
discrimination between those interactions which do, and those which do not, count
as “observations” and thereby give rise to real physical “happenings”? Otherwise
the theory’s account of what is real would necessarily remain “unprofessionally
vague and ambiguous”. But of course, such a concern presupposes something that
Heisenberg and Bohr apparently did not accept – namely, that it is the proper goal
of a physical theory to provide a clear and unambiguous account of what is real.
In terms of the quantum mechanical formalism, the question about the precise
meaning of “observation” becomes the question of how to understand, and when
precisely to apply, the postulate of wave function collapse. About this Heisenberg
writes:

6.2 Heisenberg
153
The observation itself changes the probability function discontinuously; it selects of all
possible events the actual one that has taken place. Since through the observation our knowl-
edge of the system has changed discontinuously, its mathematical representation also has
undergone the discontinuous change and we speak of a ‘quantum jump’.
Therefore, the transition from the ‘possible’ to the ‘actual’ takes place during the act of
observation. If we want to describe what happens in an atomic event, we have to realize that
the word ‘happens’ can apply only to the observation, not to the state of affairs between two
observations. It applies to the physical, not the psychical act of observation, and we may say
that the transition from the ‘possible’ to the ‘actual’ takes place as soon as the interaction
of the object with the measuring device, and thereby with the rest of the world has come
into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the
observer. The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with
the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant
of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function [5].
One can see here, again, how Heisenberg’s formulations invite some of the objec-
tions we have discussed previously. For example, if the change in the quantum state
(induced by observation) merely represents a change in our knowledge of the system,
doesn’t that imply that the observation is simply revealing a fact about the observed
system which was perfectly deﬁnite (though unknown) prior to the observation, such
that the (earlier) quantum mechanical description was simply incomplete?
But on the other hand, we also begin to appreciate the very different underlying
philosophical perspective that immunized Bohr and Heisenberg against such objec-
tions: if, for example, reference to unknown or unobserved elements of physical
reality is literally meaningless, then the clean division between the epistemic and
ontological interpretations of wave function collapse dissolves and the incomplete-
ness objection loses its force.
Heisenberg continues, addressing (what would later become) Bell’s objection that
the vagueness and arbitrariness of the division of the world implied by the distinction
between “observation processes” and “regular processes”:
It has been said that we always start with a division of the world into an object, which we
are going to study, and the rest of the world, and that this division is to some extent arbitrary.
It should indeed not make any difference in the ﬁnal result if we, e.g., add some part of the
measuring device or the whole device to the object and apply the laws of quantum theory
to this more complicated object. It can be shown that such an alteration of the theoretical
treatment would not alter the predictions concerning a given experiment. This follows math-
ematically from the fact that the laws of quantum theory are for the phenomena in which
Planck’s constant can be considered as a very small quantity, approximately identical with
the classical laws. But it would be a mistake to believe that this application of the quantum
theoretical laws to the measuring device could help to avoid the fundamental paradox of
quantum theory.
Themeasuringdevicedeservesthisnameonlyifitisinclosecontactwiththerestoftheworld,
if there is an interaction between the device and the observer. Therefore, the uncertainty
with respect to the microscopic behavior of the world will enter into the quantum-theoretical
system here just as well as in the ﬁrst interpretation. If the measuring device would be isolated
from the rest of the world, it would be neither a measuring device nor could it be described
in the terms of classical physics at all. ....
Certainly quantum theory does not contain genuine subjective features, it does not introduce
the mind of the physicist as a part of the atomic event. But it starts from the division of the

154
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
world into the ‘object’ and the rest of the world, and from the fact that at least for the rest
of the world we use the classical concepts in our description. This division is arbitrary and
historically a direct consequence of our scientiﬁc method; the use of the classical concepts is
ﬁnally a consequence of the general human way of thinking. But this is already a reference
to ourselves and ... so ... our description is not completely objective [5].
Heisenberg thus rather explicitly acknowledges the criticisms of the theory that
started our discussion of the measurement problem in Chap.3: the theory indeed
“starts from the division of the world into the ‘object’ and the rest of the world”,
this “division is arbitrary”, and the systems on the two sides of the division are to be
described in radically different theoretical terms.
But, again, on the other hand, it also becomes increasingly clear that
Heisenberg does not see any of this as some sort of fatal ﬂaw in the way that the
critics (Schrödinger, Einstein, Bell, etc.) did. For Heisenberg, the theory is simply
not an attempt to provide a literal, realistic description of the world. Its structure –
and in particular the fact that it necessarily divides the world into two realms which
are described very differently – should instead be understood as having merely an
epistemological signiﬁcance, growing out of the nature of “our scientiﬁc method”
and “the general human way of thinking”. The theory, in short, should be understood
less as an attempt to provide an objective description of nature, and more as a kind of
practical algorithm (with few if any ontological commitments) for making empirical
predictions.
From Heisenberg’s point of view, then, the criticisms of the critics are largely mis-
placed – even though, he would have to admit, the theory does fail to provide the kind
of literal, direct description of physical processes that the critics ultimately wanted.
According to the Copenhagen philosophy, however, this is no kind of deﬁciency in
the quantum theory. Instead, from the point of view of Bohr and Heisenberg, the
ﬂaw lies in the misplaced demands of the critics: what they want, according to the
Copenhagen point of view, is unattainable and indeed at odds with the nature of
human scientiﬁc knowledge, so they are simply wrong to want it.
Let’s give Heisenberg the ﬁnal word:
...it has sometimes been suggested that one should depart from the classical concepts alto-
gether and that a radical change in the concepts used for describing the experiments might
possibly lead back to a nonstatical, completely objective description of nature.
This suggestion, however, rests upon a misunderstanding. The concepts of classical physics
are just a reﬁnement of the concepts of daily life and are an essential part of the language
which forms the basis of all natural science. Our actual situation in science is such that we
do use the classical concepts for the description of the experiments, and it was the problem
of quantum theory to ﬁnd theoretical interpretation of the experiments on that basis. There
is no use in discussing what could be done if we were other beings than we are [5].
6.3
Bohr on Einstein’s Diffraction Example
In the last two sections, we’ve attempted to give a broad philosophical overview of the
Copenhagen interpretation, closely grounded in the writings of Bohr and Heisenberg.
We discussed, again in very abstract terms, some of the ways in which their views

Fig. 6.1 Updated version of Bohr’s illustration of Einstein’s diffraction example (compare to the
earlier Fig.4.1). The diffracted wave has an angular spread θ implying appreciable probability for
the particle to localize at many different points including A and B. Einstein’s argument was that the
(anti-) correlation between seeing the particle at A and seeing it at B implied either a kind of spooky
action at a distance, or that the particle had a deﬁnite location all along (such that the description
in terms of a diffracting wave was incomplete). In his version of the setup, Bohr also includes a
moveable aperture (the gray trapezoids) which can be slid in place as shown – so there is a single
slit of width a – or moved down at speed v to block the slit
seem to relate to the sorts of criticisms we reviewed in the previous three chapters.
But Bohr, especially, engaged very directly with the critics, especially Einstein, on
several example scenarios where their different points of view can be seen to clash
in much more concrete terms. In this section (and the two following ones) we will
thus turn to further elucidating the Copenhagen interpretation in the context of a few
of these concrete examples.
We begin with Bohr’s discussion of the example Einstein raised at the 1927
Solvay conference (which we discussed in Chap.4 in the “Einstein’s Boxes” section).
Bohr discusses this in his beautifully written and rightly famous 1949 reminiscence,
“Discussion with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics” [6].
Bohr begins his discussion by summarizing Einstein’s example as follows:
To illustrate his attitude, Einstein referred ... to the simple example illustrated by [Fig.6.1],
of a particle (electron or photon) penetrating through a hole or a narrow slit in a diaphragm
placed at some distance before a photographic plate. On account of the diffraction of the
wave connected with the motion of the particle and indicated in the ﬁgure by the thin lines, it
is under such conditions not possible to predict with certainty at what point the electron will
arrive at the photographic plate, but only to calculate the probability that, in an experiment,
the electron will be found within any given region of the plate. The apparent difﬁculty, in this
description, which Einstein felt so acutely, is the fact that, if in the experiment the electron
is recorded at one point A ... then it is out of the question of ever observing an effect of this
electron at another point (B), although the laws of ordinary wave propagation offer no room
for a correlation between two such events.
Einstein’s attitude gave rise to ardent discussions.... [which] centered on the question of
whether the quantum-mechanical description exhausted the possibilities of accounting for
observable phenomena or, as Einstein maintained, the analysis could be carried further and,
especially, of whether a fuller description of the phenomena could be obtained by bringing
into consideration the detailed balance of energy and momentum in individual processes [6].

156
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
The ﬁrst paragraph seems like a perfectly good summary of Einstein’s arguments
(although the role of “locality” is perhaps not adequately stressed). But Bohr doesn’t
seem to have understood Einstein’s argument (that, if one assumes locality, a full
description of the physical state of the system must include more facts than are
containedinthequantumdescription) as theprimaryissuehere. Instead, Bohr focuses
onanalyzingthesuggestionthat,bymonitoringtherecoilofthediaphragm,onemight
improve one’s ability to predict where the particle might eventually be detected: for
example, assuming the incident particle and the diaphragm have no initial vertical
momentum, then if (prior to the particle’s arrival at the screen) one observes that
the diaphragm has acquired (say) a downward momentum, it must be (assuming
momentum conservation) that the particle has deﬂected upward, toward (say) point
A rather than point B.
Recall from Chap.4 that, according to Einstein, the application of the locality
concept to this example requires that one “not describe the process solely by the
Schrödinger wave, but that at the same time one localises the particle during the
propagation.” What Einstein meant to be arguing for, that is, is the claim that the
particle has a deﬁnite location (say, near A or near B) even before it is observed.
For Einstein, this reality claim would stand independently of whether or not the pre-
measurement location of the particle could be (in some indirect sense, as for example
by monitoring the recoil of the diaphragm) determined, and, indeed, whether or not
the inclusion of the particle trajectory in one’s theoretical description would change
the operational predictions. For Bohr, though, the idea of a physical reality which is
unobservable and/or irrelevant to theoretical predictions is a kind of contradiction in
terms. So it makes sense to some degree that Bohr interpreted Einstein as arguing
that it should be possible to improve (beyond what is allowed by ordinary quantum
theory) one’s practical ability to predict where the particle will hit the screen. This
explains why Bohr’s analysis of Einstein’s diffraction example focuses on defending
the self-consistency of the limitations placed on the theory’s predictive accuracy by
the Heisenberg uncertainty formulas.
That analysis proceeds as follows. Suppose the incoming particle has momen-
tum p = h/λ and the slit (when open) has width a. Then the particle will acquire,
assuming it passes the slit, an uncertainty in its transverse position q ≈a. Then
the standard relation for the angular width of a diffraction pattern (θ ≈λ/a) implies
that there is an uncertainty in the transverse component of the particle’s momentum
of order
p ≈θ · p ≈
h
q
(6.1)
which is just the usual Heisenberg uncertainty relation. As Bohr notes: “This result
could, of course, also be obtained directly by noticing that, due to the limited exten-
sion of the wave-ﬁeld at the place of the slit, the component of the wave-number
parallel to the plane of the diaphragm will involve a latitude k ≈(1/a) ≈(1/q).”
Now, if we suppose that the shutter opens the width-a slit only for a time t, the
wave packet will have a spread of frequencies of width

6.3 Bohr on Einstein’s Diffraction Example
157
ν ≈1
t
(6.2)
which then implies, using the usual quantum energy-frequency relation E = hν, an
uncertainty in the particle’s energy of order
E ≈h ν ≈h/t.
(6.3)
This is again the usual (energy-time) Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
Bohr then raises the question of where these latitudes in the particle’s momentum
and energy come from. That is, if E and p represent the expected sizes of changes
in the energy and momentum of the particle as it traverses the slit – and if the total
energy and total momentum of an isolated system are strictly conserved – where do
the new contributions to the energy and momentum of the particle come from? Bohr
explains:
From the point of view of the laws of conservation, the origin of such latitudes entering
into the description of the state of the particle after passing through the hole may be traced
to the possibilities of momentum and energy exchange with the diaphragm or the shutter.
In the reference system [of the Figure], the velocity of the diaphragm may be disregarded
and only a change of momentum p between the particle and the diaphragm needs to be
taken into consideration. The shutter, however, which leaves the hole opened during the time
t, moves with a considerable velocity v ≈a/t, and a momentum transfer p involves
therefore an energy exchange with the particle, amounting to [E =

vF(t)dt ≈]v p ≈
(1/t)qp ≈h/t, being just of the same order of magnitude as the latitude E given
by [Eq.(6.3)] and, thus, allowing for momentum and energy balance [6].
With all of that laid out, Bohr then turns to confront Einstein’s concerns (as he
understood them) more directly. If, for example, the position and momentum of the
diaphragm itself are carefully controlled and monitored, and conservation of energy
and momentum are assumed in the interaction between the diaphragm and the passing
particle, could one predict the subsequent behavior of the particle more accurately
than would be allowed according to the quantum description?
The problem raised by Einstein was now to what extent a control of the momentum and
energy transfer, involved in a location of the particle in space and time, can be used for
a further speciﬁcation of the state of the particle after passing through the hole. Here, it
must be taken into consideration that the position and the motion of the diaphragm and the
shutter have so far been assumed to be accurately co-ordinated with the space-time reference
frame. This assumption implies, in the description of the state of these bodies, an essential
latitude as to their momentum and energy which need not, of course, noticeably affect the
velocities, if the diaphragm and the shutter are sufﬁciently heavy. However, as soon as we
want to know the momentum and energy of these parts of the measuring arrangement with
an accuracy sufﬁcient to control the momentum and energy exchange with the particle under
investigation, we shall, in accordance with the general indeterminacy relations, lose the
possibility of their accurate location in space and time. We have, therefore, to examine how
far this circumstance will affect the intended use of the whole arrangement and, as we shall
see, this crucial point clearly brings out the complementary character of the phenomenon [6].
Bohr means here that, up to now, we have assumed that the diaphragm is rigidly ﬁxed
in place so that, for example, its velocity is exactly zero and its position (the location

of the slit that the particle goes through) is precisely known. To make this concrete,
one might imagine that the diaphragm structure is physically bolted down to the
solid earth. But such bolts would allow and indeed necessitate a physical interaction,
by means of which arbitrarily large quantities of energy and momentum might be
exchanged between the diaphragm and the earth. So by bolting the diaphragm down
(and thus precisely ﬁxing its spatial location) we lose all control of its energy and
momentum – and hence lose any ability to infer, from some hypothetical later mea-
surement of its energy or momentum, any further information about the location of
the now-distant particle.
Of course, by unbolting the diaphragm and, say, letting it glide freely along a
frictionless track (running vertically in the Figure), we could remove the ability
of the diaphragm to exchange energy and momentum with the earth, and thereby
recover the ability to infer, from a later measurement of the energy or momentum
of the diaphragm, something about the energy or momentum of the now-distant
particle. But then, by the uncertainty principle, the spatial location of the diaphragm
(and hence that of the particle) would become completely undeﬁned. Thus, in a broad
qualitative sense, Einstein’s idea, as understood by Bohr, seems doomed.
Bohr proceeds to develop a closely-related example in which these ideas can more
easily be analyzed quantitatively:
The importance of considerations of this kind was, in the course of the discussions, most
interestingly illuminated by the examination of an arrangement [involving a] diaphragm
with two parallel slits, as is shown in [Fig.6.2]. If a parallel beam of electrons (or photons)
falls from the left [we shall] observe on the plate an interference pattern indicated by the
[dark grey curve]. With intense beams, this pattern is built up by the accumulation of a large
number of individual processes, each giving rise to a small spot on the photographic plate,
and the distribution of these spots follows a simple law derivable from the wave analysis.
The same distribution should also be found in the statistical account of many experiments
performed with beams so faint that in a single exposure only one electron (or photon) will
arrive at the photographic plate at some spot.... Since, now, as indicated by the [dashed
lines], the momentum transferred to the ... diaphragm ought to be different if the electron

6.3 Bohr on Einstein’s Diffraction Example
159
was assumed to pass through the upper or the lower slit ..., Einstein suggested that a control of
the momentum transfer would permit a closer analysis of the phenomenon and, in particular,
to decide through which of the two slits the electron had passed before arriving at the plate [6].
Einstein, that is, had the idea that by carefully monitoring the position and momentum
of the diaphragm (with, now, two slits in it), one could infer (from the ﬁnal location at
which the particle hits the detection screen) which slit the particle had gone through,
because the momentum transfer between the particle and the diaphragm would need
to have been slightly different in the two cases.
Bohr then presents the following rebuttal of Einstein’s idea. The incident particle
has momentum p = h/λ. The key idea here is that the momentum transfer between
the particle and the diaphragm will be different, depending on which slit the particle
goes through. For simplicity, in the Figure we have shown the case where there is no
vertical momentum transfer if the particle goes through the top slit, whereas if the
particle goes through the bottom slit it must bend upward by angle θ which implies
it acquires a vertical momentum component of magnitude p sin(θ) ≈(h/λ)(d/L)
where we have written sin(θ) in terms of the slit-spacing d and screen-distance L
shown in the ﬁgure.
Now the idea is supposed to be that, by monitoring the vertical momentum of the
diaphragm, we can determine, after the particle has passed, which slit it must have
gone through. This will require that we can discriminate between the case in which
the particle goes through the upper slit and the case in which the particle goes through
the lower slit. But this requires that the uncertainty P on the vertical momentum of
the diaphragm be less than the difference between the momenta imparted to it when
the particle goes through the different slits:
P ≤h
λ
d
L .
(6.4)
But then, if we apply Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle to the diaphragm we see
that it must also have an uncertainty in its vertical position satisfying
Q ≥
h
P ≥λ · L
d
.
(6.5)
This, as it turns out, is a very interesting result, because it is exactly the distance
x between interference fringes on the screen. Therefore, in order to be able to
determine which slit the particle went through by subsequently monitoring the ver-
tical momentum of the diaphragm, the vertical position of the diaphragm must be
uncertain by an amount greater than the fringe spacing on the screen:
Q ≥x.
(6.6)
But this obviously means that the interference pattern will be washed out: from
one particle to the next, the probability distribution for the particle to hit the screen
will shift up and down randomly by a distance as big as the spacing between the

160
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
interference fringes. And so the statistical pattern that builds up will no longer display
the characteristic two-slit interference pattern.
Bohr summarizes the implications as follows:
This point is of great logical consequence, since it is only the circumstance that we are pre-
sented with a choice of either tracing the path of the particle or observing interference effects,
which allows us to escape from the paradoxical necessity of concluding that the behaviour
of an electron or a photon should depend on the presence of a slit in the diaphragm through
which it could be proved not to pass. We have here to do with a typical example of how
the complementary phenomena appear under mutually exclusive experimental arrangements
... and are just faced with the impossibility, in the analysis of quantum effects, of drawing
any sharp separation between an independent behaviour of atomic objects and their interac-
tion with the measuring instruments which serve to deﬁne the conditions under which the
phenomena occur [6].
The example thus shows not only that one cannot determine more details about the
particle than is permitted according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but also
demonstrates the complementarity of the wave and particle descriptions: by adjusting
the experimental arrangement in a way that allows an unambiguous determination
of the particle’s path, its wave character (namely, the appearance of interference) is
thereby suppressed.
6.4
The Photon Box Thought Experiment
In his “Discussions with Einstein” essay, Bohr goes on to present another famous
thought experiment that Einstein had proposed at the 1930 Solvay Conference:
Asanobjectiontotheviewthatacontroloftheinterchangeofmomentumandenergybetween
the objects and the measuring instruments was excluded if these instruments should serve
their purpose of deﬁning the space-time frame of the phenomena, Einstein brought forward
the argument that such control should be possible when the exigencies of relativity theory
were taken into consideration. In particular, the general relationship between energy and
mass, expressed in Einstein’s famous formula
E = mc2
should allow, by means of a simple weighing, to measure the total energy of any system
and, thus, in principle to control the energy transferred to it when it interacts with an atomic
object.
As an arrangement suited for such purpose, Einstein proposed the device indicated in
[Fig.6.3], consisting of a box with a hole in its side, which could be opened or closed
by a shutter moved by means of a clock-work within the box. If, in the beginning, the box
contained a certain amount of radiation and the clock was set to open the shutter for a very
short interval at a chosen time, it could be achieved that a single photon was released through
the hole at a moment known with as great accuracy as desired. Moreover, it would appar-
ently also be possible, by weighing the whole box before and after this event, to measure the
energy of the photon with any accuracy wanted, in deﬁnite contradiction to the reciprocal
indeterminacy of time and energy quantities in quantum mechanics [6].

6.4 The Photon Box Thought Experiment
161
Fig. 6.3 Einstein’s photon box setup as discussed by Bohr in Ref. [6]. An alarm clock inside the
box triggers, at a pre-determined time as registered by the clock, a mechanical apparatus which
brieﬂy opens a shutter, allowing a single photon to escape to the right. The box hangs from a spring
so that the weight of the box can be read from the scale on the left. After the photon is released,
additional weight can be hung from the bottom of the box until the pointer returns to its original
position, thus allowing a determination of the energy E of the escaped photon
So the idea is as follows: the clock mechanism inside the box will open the shutter
at, say, time t, for a short duration t. During this period, a single photon will
emerge from the aperture toward the right. The photon will be represented quantum
mechanically as a wave packet of temporal duration t. This implies, by the standard
energy-time uncertainty formula, that the energy of the photon will be “fuzzy” by an
amount E ≥h/t.
Einstein’s idea, however, was that the energy of the photon could be determined
with arbitrary accuracy, after its emission, by carefully weighing the box from which
the photon had emerged. And so the energy of the (now distant!) photon can be
determined – and must hence be physically well-deﬁned – to an accuracy greater than
its quantum mechanical uncertainty E. And so the quantum mechanical description
must be incomplete.
According to Bohr, however, “it became clear ... that this argument could not be
upheld.” For, as Bohr goes on to explain, the process of weighing the box is itself
subject to uncertainty principle constraints:

162
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
The weighing of the box may ... be performed with any given accuracy m by adjusting the
balance to its zero position by means of suitable loads. The essential point is now that any
determination of this position with a given accuracy q will involve a minimum latitude p
in the control of the momentum of the box connected with q by the [Heisenberg uncertainty
principle]. This latitude must obviously again be smaller than the total impulse which, during
the whole interval T of the balancing procedure, can be given by the gravitational ﬁeld to a
body with a mass m, or
p ≈
h
q < T · g · m
where g is the gravity constant. The greater the accuracy of the reading q of the pointer,
the longer must, consequently, be the balancing interval T , if a given accuracy m of the
weighing of the box with its content shall be obtained.
Then, in a masterful judo-like move of using one of Einstein’s greatest accomplish-
ments against him, Bohr notes that
according to general relativity theory, a clock, when displaced in the direction of the gravi-
tational force by an amount of q, will change its rate in such a way that its reading in the
course of a time interval T will differ by an amount T given by the relation
T
T
= 1
c2 gq.
By comparing [the last two equations] we see, therefore, that after the weighing procedure
there will in our knowledge of the adjustment of the clock be a latitude
T >
h
c2m .
Together with [the formula E = m c2 coming from Einstein’s famous equation], this
relation again leads to
T · E > h
in accordance with the indeterminacy principle. Consequently, the use of the apparatus as
a means of accurately measuring the energy of the photon will prevent us from controlling
the moment of its escape [6].
Although the physics involved is rather more complicated, the conclusion here is
essentially identical to what Bohr said in the analysis of the diffraction and interfer-
ence experiments from the previous section: using the photon box in the intended
way to determine, after its emission, both the energy and release-time of the photon,
would require mutually exclusive experimental procedures. In particular, an accurate
determination of the release-time of the photon requires that the box (with its inter-
nal clock) be held rigidly ﬁxed in the background gravitational ﬁeld; such ﬁxation,
though, allows energy transfer (with the earth or whatever the box is ﬁxed to) and
thus precludes subsequently inferring, from the weight of the box, the energy of the
now-distant photon. And conversely, leaving the box free to oscillate vertically, so
that the energy of the emitted photon can be reliably inferred, means that (due to
the general relativistic time-dilation effect) the reading of the clock can no longer
reliably indicate the release-time of the photon.
Thus – if it had indeed been Einstein’s claim that the energy E and emission
time T of the photon could both be determined, by subsequent examination of the

6.4 The Photon Box Thought Experiment
163
box, to an accuracy greater than should be allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty
relations – then Bohr has shown that in fact, no, this is not after all possible. As
long as we consistently apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to all elements
of the physical system under examination (including the measuring equipment!) it
seems to turn out that the uncertainty principle cannot be beaten. Bohr regards this
as the essential proof for the completeness of the quantum mechanical description.
And since in supposedly refuting Einstein’s objection, Bohr had used Einstein’s own
general relativity against him, this episode is widely regarded as a rhetorical triumph
for Bohr and the Copenhagen philosophy.
But was this, after all, Einstein’s claim?
Interestingly, Bohr reports that, around 1933
Einstein was far from satisﬁed and with his usual acuteness had discerned new aspects
of the situation which strengthened his critical attitude. In fact, by further examining the
possibilitiesfortheapplicationofthebalancearrangement,Einsteinhadperceivedalternative
procedures which, even if they did not allow the use he originally intended, might seem to
enhance the paradoxes beyond the possibilities of logical solution [6].
Such comments by Bohr have given rise to a widespread suggestion that, between
1930 and 1935 (when the EPR paper ﬁnally appeared) Einstein responded to his
supposed defeats (in 1927 and 1930) by fundamentally changing his approach to
criticizing the developing Copenhagen orthodoxy. In particular, according to this
viewpoint, Einstein ﬁnally came to grips with the internal consistency of the theory
and began to explore instead the “new aspects” that would appear explicitly in the
1935 EPR paper.
Recall from Sect.4.1, however, the centrality of the concept of locality to Ein-
stein’s concerns as he expressed them already in 1927. As we have seen, Bohr’s
1949 recapitulation of the 1927 discussions seem to completely omit the aspects of
Einstein’s concerns that render them quite in line with the later EPR argument. So
one begins to suspect that the “new aspects” (of Einstein’s thinking) which Bohr
recognized only after 1930, were not new at all; instead, Bohr had simply failed to
understand them prior to this point.
In regard to the photon box thought experiment, this suspicion would imply that
the concept of locality played, somehow, a more central and important role than
is apparent in Bohr’s analysis. In particular, one suspects that, for Einstein, it was
crucial that (after some time) the emitted photon is spatially separated from the box.
Locality would then seem to imply that our choice of which measuring procedure to
implement on the box, could have no effect on the physical state of the distant photon.
One suspects, that is, that for Einstein locality was the crucial assumption warranting
inference from “we could measure either of two complementary properties on the
nearby system” to “both of the corresponding properties must exist for the distant
system”.
The suspicion is strongly conﬁrmed by the contents of a letter written to Bohr
by Paul Ehrenfest (with whom Einstein had discussed the dialogues from the 1930
meeting shortly afterwards). We quote here philosopher Don Howard’s description
of this entire episode:

164
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
At center stage in the Einstein-Bohr encounter at the 1930 Solvay meeting was Einstein’s
well-known photon box thought experiment. A box containing a photon has an opening
covered by a shutter that is activated by a timer attached to a clock inside the box by
means of which we could accurately time the emission of the photon from the box. The
whole box is suspended by a spring by means of which arrangement we could weigh the
box both before and after the photon’s emission with whatever accuracy we desire, thus
determining the photon’s energy via the mass-energy equivalence relation. As Bohr tells the
story, Einstein introduced the photon-box thought experiment for the purpose, yet again,
of exhibiting violations of Heisenberg indeterminacy. Simply perform both measurements:
weigh the box to ﬁx the emitted photon’s energy and open the box to check the clock and ﬁx
the time of emission. Bohr tells us that, at ﬁrst, Einstein had him completely stumped. He
could ﬁnd no ﬂaw in Einstein’s reasoning. Only in the wee hours of the morning did it come
to him. Ironically, general relativity would save quantum mechanics, speciﬁcally the general
relativistic effect of a gravitational ﬁeld on clock rates. A quick calculation showed Bohr
that the change in the box’s mass when the photon is emitted changes, in turn, its vertical
location in the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, and that the effect of the latter change on the rate
of the clock in the box induces precisely the uncertainty in the clock’s rate needed to ensure
satisfaction of the Heisenberg indeterminacy principle. Bohr uses general relativity against
Einstein to save quantum mechanics! A wonderful story. But is it true?
Einstein seems to have thought that they were arguing about something else. We know this
from a letter that Paul Ehrenfest wrote to Bohr in July 1931, after a visit with Einstein in
Berlin. Ehrenfest and Einstein seem to have had a long and thorough chat about the debate
with Bohr at the previous fall’s Solvay meeting. Ehrenfest reports to Bohr a most surprising
comment from Einstein:
He [Einstein] said to me that, for a very long time already, he absolutely no longer doubted
the uncertainty relations, and that he thus, e.g., had BY NO MEANS invented the ‘weighable
light-ﬂash box’ (let us call it simply L-F-box) ‘contra uncertainty relation,’ but for a totally
different purpose. [Ehrenfest to Bohr, 9 July 1931]
What was that totally different purpose? It was nothing other than an anticipation of Einstein’s
later argument for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics.
As Ehrenfest explains to Bohr, Einstein’s idea was this. Let the photon leave the box and be
reﬂected back from a great time and distance, say one-half light year. At about the time when
the photon is reﬂected, we can either weigh the box or check the clock, making possible
our predicting either the exact time of the photon’s return or its energy (literally, its color),
which is to say that, depending upon which measurement we choose, we ascribe a different
theoretical state to the photon, one with deﬁnite energy, one entailing a deﬁnite time of arrival.
Crucial is the fact that the event of performing the measurement on the box – weighing it the
second time or checking the clock – is [spatially] separated from the event of the photon’s
distant reﬂection, because then our choice of a measurement to perform can have no effect
on the real state of affairs of the photon, meaning that the photon’s real state of affairs when
it returns will be one and the same, regardless of the measurement we performed on the
box. This is all just quantum mechanics, in Einstein’s view. But then quantum mechanics
has associated two different theoretical states with one real state of affairs, which is possible
only if the quantum theory’s state descriptions are incomplete [7].
So it deﬁnitely appears that Einstein’s early (pre-1935) arguments were simply not
understoodproperlybyBohr. (Andit is curious that Bohr’s later account of theseearly
discussions did not attempt to correct the misunderstanding, but instead reinforced it
for posterity.) In any case, though, it represents progress that, by around 1933, Bohr

6.4 The Photon Box Thought Experiment
165
(in his re-telling) began to recognize and more directly confront the “new aspects”
of Einstein’s arguments.
Here is Bohr’s description of these “new aspects” in the context of the photon box
thought experiment:
Einstein had pointed out that, after a preliminary weighing of the box with the clock and
the subsequent escape of the photon, one was still left with the choice of either repeating
the weighing or opening the box and comparing the reading of the clock with the standard
time scale. Consequently, we are at this stage still free to choose whether we want to draw
conclusions either about the energy of the photon or about the moment when it left the box.
Without in any way interfering with the photon between its escape and its later interaction
with other suitable measuring instruments, we are, thus, able to make accurate predictions
pertaining either to the moment of its arrival or to the amount of energy liberated by its
absorption. Since, however, according to the quantum-mechanical formalism, the speciﬁca-
tion of the state of an isolated particle cannot involve both a well-deﬁned connection with
the time scale and an accurate ﬁxation of the energy, it might thus appear as if this formalism
did not offer the means of an adequate description [6].
Now that, for sure, captures the concern that Einstein seems to have had in mind all
along, and would eventually appear most famously and explicitly in the 1935 EPR
paper. Note in particular the exact parallel to the EPR reasoning: by measuring one
property of the box, we can determine an exact value for the corresponding property
of the distant photon; on the other hand, by instead measuring a different property
of the box, we can determine an exact value for a different property of the distant
photon; but since our measurements on the box must – by the locality assumption –
have no effect on the physical state of the distant photon, the possibility of our
determining either of these properties implies that both properties have, already, sharp
(if unknown) values. And so the quantum mechanical formalism (which precludes
such simultaneous value assignments) must be incomplete.
So how, then, does Bohr respond to this early version of the EPR argument?
Once more Einstein’s searching spirit had elicited a peculiar aspect of the situation in quan-
tum theory, which in a most striking manner illustrated how far we have here transcended
customary explanation of natural phenomena. Still, I could not agree with the trend of his
remarks.... In my opinion, there could be no other way to deem a logically consistent math-
ematical formalism as inadequate than by demonstrating the departure of its consequences
from experience or by proving that its predictions did not exhaust the possibilities of obser-
vation, and Einstein’s argumentation could be directed to neither of these ends. In fact, we
must realize that in the problem in question we are not dealing with a single speciﬁed exper-
imental arrangement, but are referring to two different, mutually exclusive arrangements. In
the one, the balance together with another piece of apparatus like a spectrometer is used for
the study of the energy transferred to the photon; in the other, a shutter regulated by a stan-
dardized clock together with another apparatus of similar kind, accurately timed relatively to
the clock, is used for the study of the time of propagation of a photon over a given distance.
In both these cases, as also assumed by Einstein, the observable effects are expected to be
in complete conformity with the predictions of the theory.
The problem again emphasizes the necessity of considering the whole experimental arrange-
ment, the speciﬁcation of which is imperative for any well-deﬁned application of the
quantum-mechanical formalism [6].

The Copenhagen Interpretation
I think it is probably safe to say that one will either regard this response as satisfying,
or not, depending on the extent to which one’s philosophical attitudes align with
those of Bohr, or Einstein, respectively.
In the next section, we will continue to explore Bohr’s responses to Einstein’s
concerns by considering Bohr’s ofﬁcial response to the 1935 paper of Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen.
6.5
Bohr’s Reply to EPR
Let us then ﬁnally turn to Bohr’s response to the actual EPR paper of 1935. It is of
historical interest that, according to the later recollection of Bohr’s close colleague
Rosenfeld, the EPR paper was an “onslaught” which “came down upon us as a bolt
from the blue.” Rosenfeld reports that “as soon as Bohr had heard my report of
Einstein’s argument, everything else was abandoned” as they dedicated themselves
to rebutting the argument [8].
So, after the days and weeks of careful thinking, how did Bohr respond? Early
on in the essay, Bohr reviews the idea that the impossibility of attributing deﬁnite
properties to measured systems arises from the uncontrollable physical disturbance
of their states during the physical interaction with the measuring apparatus:
The apparent contradiction in fact discloses only an essential inadequacy of the customary
viewpoint of natural philosophy for a rational account of physical phenomena of the type with
which we are concerned in quantum mechanics. Indeed the ﬁnite interaction between object
and measuring agencies conditioned by the very existence of the quantum of action entails
– because of the impossibility of controlling the reaction of the object on the measuring
instruments if these are to serve their purpose – the necessity of a ﬁnal renunciation of the
classical ideal of causality and a radical revision of our attitude towards the problem of
physical reality [9].
But surely the intention of the EPR argument was precisely to neutralize this “dis-
turbance” defense, by separating the measurement event from the particle to which
properties are being attributed. If, in the EPR case, the deﬁnite inferred properties of
the distant particle in any sense arise, newly, as a result of the measurement on the
nearby partner, this would be the very sort of nonlocal causation that EPR regarded
as unacceptable or, more precisely, in conﬂict with relativity’s prohibition on faster-
than-light causation.
Bohr seems to only partially appreciate this, and his response is thus notoriously
difﬁcult to understand. He insists that the EPR criterion of reality (inside of which,
remember, the crucial concept of locality was buried) “contains – however cautious
its formulation may appear – an essential ambiguity when it is applied to the actual
problems with which we are here concerned” [9]. Here is his detailed statement of
the alleged ambiguity:
From our point of view we now see that the wording of the above-mentioned criterion of
physical reality proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen contains an ambiguity as regards
the meaning of the expression ‘without in any way disturbing a system.’ Of course there

6.5 Bohr’s Reply to EPR
167
is in a case like that just considered no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system
under investigation during the last critical stage of the measuring procedure. But even at this
stage there is essentially the question of an inﬂuence on the very conditions which deﬁne
the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of the system. Since these
conditions constitute an inherent element of the description of any phenomenon to which
the term ‘physical reality’ can be properly attached, we see that the argumentation of the
mentioned authors does not justify their conclusion that quantum-mechanical description
is essentially incomplete. On the contrary this description, as appears from the preceding
discussion, may be characterized as a rational utilization of all possibilities of unambiguous
interpretation of measurements, compatible with the ﬁnite and uncontrollable interaction
between the objects and the measuring instruments in the ﬁeld of quantum theory. In fact, it
isonlythemutualexclusionofanytwoexperimentalprocedures,permittingtheunambiguous
deﬁnition of complementary physical quantities, which provides room for new physical laws,
the coexistence of which might at ﬁrst sight appear irreconcilable with the basic principles of
science. It is just this entirely new situation as regards the description of physical phenomena,
that the notion of complementarity aims at characterizing [9].
It seems that Bohr is agreeing with EPR that a “mechanical disturbance” – that is, a
nonlocal causal inﬂuence on the distant particle – is unacceptable. But, he seems to
say, there is another kind of inﬂuence – what one commentator [10] has described as
a “semantic disturbance”... not, apparently, a physical inﬂuence per se, but instead
an inﬂuence on what we can say about the distant system.
Here is what Bell would write, later, about Bohr’s response:
While imagining that I understand the position of Einstein, as regards the EPR correlations,
I have very little understanding of the position of his principal opponent, Bohr. Yet most
contemporary theorists have the impression that Bohr got the better of Einstein in the argu-
ment and are under the impression that they themselves share Bohr’s views. As an indication
of those views I quote a passage from his reply to Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. It is a
passage which Bohr himself seems to have regarded as deﬁnitive, quoting it himself when
summing up much later. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had assumed that ‘...if, without in
any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity,
then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity’.
Bohr replied: ‘...the wording of the above mentioned criterion... contains an ambiguity as
regards the meaning of the expression “without in any way disturbing a system”. Of course
there is in a case like that just considered no question of a mechanical disturbance of the
system under investigation during the last critical stage of the measuring procedure. But even
at this stage there is essentially the question of an inﬂuence on the very conditions which
deﬁne the possible types of predictions regarding the future behaviour of the system [so]
their argumentation does not justify their conclusion that quantum mechanical description is
essentially incomplete ... This description may be characterized as a rational utilization of all
possibilities of unambiguous interpretation of measurements, compatible with the ﬁnite and
uncontrollable interaction between the objects and the measuring instruments in the ﬁeld of
quantum theory’.
Indeed I have very little idea what this means. I do not understand in what sense the word
‘mechanical’ is used, in characterizing the disturbances which Bohr does not contemplate,
as distinct from those which he does. I do not know what the italicized passage means – ‘an
inﬂuence on the very conditions...’. Could it mean just that different experiments on the ﬁrst
system give different kinds of information about the second? But this was just one of the
main points of EPR, who observed that one could learn either the position or the momentum
of the second system. And then I do not understand the ﬁnal reference to ‘uncontrollable
interactions between measuring instruments and objects’, [as] it seems just to ignore the
essential point of EPR that in the absence of action at a distance, only the ﬁrst system could

168
6
The Copenhagen Interpretation
be supposed disturbed by the ﬁrst measurement and yet deﬁnite predictions become possible
for the second system. Is Bohr just rejecting the premise – ‘no action at a distance’ – rather
than refuting the argument? [11].
Bell, that is, suggests reading Bohr as conceding (despite his explicit denial of a
speciﬁcally “mechanical” disturbance) that there is a non-local action-at-a-distance
at work in this situation, according to quantum mechanics.
Einstein could also do no better than this same uncomfortable understanding of
Bohr’s response. In his 1949 commentary, he wrote:
Of the ‘orthodox’ quantum theoreticians whose position I know, Niels Bohr’s seems to me
to come nearest to doing justice to the problem. Translated into my own way of putting it,
he argues as follows:
If the partial systems A and B form a total system which is described by its -function
(AB), there is no reason why any mutually independent existence (state of reality) should
be ascribed to the partial systems A and B viewed separately, not even if the partial systems
are spatially separated from each other at the particular time under consideration. The
assertion that, in this latter case, the real situation of B could not be (directly) inﬂuenced
by any measurement taken on A is, therefore, within the framework of quantum theory,
unfounded and (as the paradox shows) unacceptable [12].
From the point of view of a “realist” such as Einstein – meaning simply someone who
believes in the existence of an external physical world that is what it is independent
of any observation and which observation is ultimately observation of – Bohr’s reply
to EPR will always remain deeply unsatisfying. Yet we must remember that from
the point of view of the Copenhagen philosophy, it is precisely, at the end of the day,
this assumption of “realism” which is being challenged. Heisenberg, for example,
wrote that
the idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as
stones or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them ... is impossible.... [13]
Bohr, similarly, insisted that in quantum mechanics we meet
in a new light the old truth that in our description of nature the purpose is not to disclose
the real essence of the phenomena but only to track down, so far as it is possible, relations
between the manifold aspects of our experience [14].
Bohr stressed repeatedly this point that physical theories must not aim at describing
some independent, objective physical reality:
The entire formalism is to be considered as a tool for deriving predictions, of deﬁnite or statis-
tical character, as regards information obtainable under experimental conditions described in
classical terms and speciﬁed by means of parameters entering into the algebraic or differential
equations.... These symbols themselves are not susceptible to pictorial interpretation [15].
And according to Bohr’s colleague Aage Petersen, when Bohr was once asked
whether the theory could in any sense be understood as describing an objective
reality, Bohr replied
There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum physical description. It is
wrong to think that the task of physics is to ﬁnd out how nature is. Physics concerns what
we can say about nature [16].

6.5 Bohr’s Reply to EPR
169
Bohr’s dismissal of the EPR argument for incompleteness may indeed be the only
coherent and rational response given this deeper philosophical point of view.
6.6
Contemporary Perspectives
I mentioned in the introduction of this chapter that the Copenhagen philosophy
achieved a kind of orthodox status in the 1930s and has essentially held this position
to the present day. But I think most physics students who have been exposed to this
orthodoxy – and indeed most physics professors who have accepted it and even taken
part in teaching it – will probably ﬁnd some aspects of the philosophy, as explained by
Bohr and Heisenberg, a little surprising. Does the Copenhagen interpretation really
insist, for example, that there simply is no real physical world at the microscopic
level? This seems bizarre if not downright incomprehensible.
One can certainly ﬁnd contemporary proponents of the Copenhagen philosophy
who embrace such radical philosophical positions. The eminent Austrian experimen-
talist Anton Zeilinger, for example, summarized “The message of the quantum” in
Copenhagen terms. He stresses the failure of classical notions of causality as follows:
The discovery that individual events are irreducibly random is probably one of the most
signiﬁcant ﬁndings of the twentieth century. Before this, one could ﬁnd comfort in the
assumption that random events only seem random because of our ignorance. For example,
although the brownian motion of a particle appears random, it can still be causally described
if we know enough about the motions of the particles surrounding it.... But for the individ-
ual event in quantum physics, not only do we not know the cause, there is no cause. The
instant when a radioactive atom decays, or the path taken by a photon behind a half-silvered
beam-splitter are objectively random. There is nothing in the Universe that determines the
way an individual event will happen. Since individual events may very well have macro-
scopic consequences ... the Universe is fundamentally unpredictable and open, not causally
closed [17].
Zeilinger then insists that “the concept of reality itself is at stake” in certain experi-
ments that we will discuss further in Chap.8. As he elaborates:
A criticism of realism also emerges from the notion of complementarity. It is not just that we
are unable to measure two complementary quantities of a particle, such as its position and
momentum, at the same time. Rather, the assumption that a particle possesses both position
and momentum, before the measurement is made, is wrong. Our choice of measurement
apparatus decides which of these quantities can become reality in the experiment.
So, what is the message of the quantum? I suggest we look at the situation from a new angle.
We have learned in the history of physics that it is important not to make distinctions that
have no basis – such as the pre-newtonian distinction between the laws on Earth and those
that govern the motion of heavenly bodies. I suggest that in a similar way, the distinction
between reality and our knowledge of reality, between reality and information, cannot be
made. There is no way to refer to reality without using the information we have about it [17].
Undoubtedly this almost idealistic (in the sense of Berkeley) anti-realism is part of
“the Copenhagen interpretation” for many contemporary physicists.

The Copenhagen Interpretation
But I think most physicists would ﬁnd themselves slightly embarrassed by this
kind of openly philosophical, anti-realist speculation. The more mainstream under-
standing of “the Copenhagen interpretation” is thus, I think, a little more restrained
and pragmatic. This attitude is nicely captured in the widely used quantum mechan-
ics text by David Grifﬁths, who explains that Born’s statistical interpretation of the
wave function
...introduces a kind of indeterminacy into quantum mechanics, for even if you know every-
thing the theory has to tell you about the particle (to wit: its wave function), you cannot
predict with certainty the outcome of a simple experiment to measure its position – all
quantum mechanics has to offer is statistical information about the possible results. This
indeterminacy has been profoundly disturbing to physicists and philosophers alike. Is it a
peculiarity of nature, a deﬁciency in the theory, a fault in the measuring apparatus, or what?
Suppose I do measure the position of the particle, and I ﬁnd it to be at [some particular]
point C. Question: Where was the particle just before I made the measurement? There are
three plausible answers to this question, and they serve to characterize the main schools of
thought regarding quantum indeterminacy:
1. The realist position: The particle was at C. This certainly seems like a sensible response,
and it is the one Einstein advocated. Note, however, that if this is true then quantum mechanics
is an incomplete theory, since the particle really was at C, and yet quantum mechanics was
unable to tell us so. To the realist, indeterminacy is not a fact of nature, but a reﬂection of
our ignorance.... Evidently  is not the whole story – some additional information (known
as a hidden variable) is needed to provide a complete description of the particle.
2. The orthodox position: The particle wasn’t really anywhere. It was the act of measurement
that forced the particle to ‘take a stand’ (though how and why it decided on the point C we
dare not ask). Jordan said it most starkly: ‘Observations not only disturb what is to be
measured, they produce it. ... We compel [the particle] to assume a deﬁnite position.’ This
view (the so-called Copenhagen interpretation) is associated with Bohr and his followers.
Among physicists it has always been the most widely accepted position. Note, however, that
if it is correct there is something very peculiar about the act of measurement – something
that over half a century of debate has done precious little to illuminate.
3. The agnostic position: Refuse to answer. This is not quite as silly as it sounds – after
all, what sense can there be in making assertions about the status of a particle before a
measurement, when the only way of knowing whether you were right is precisely to conduct
a measurement, in which case what you get is no longer ‘before the measurement’? It is
metaphysics (in the pejorative sense of the word) to worry about something that cannot, by
its nature, be tested. Pauli said, ‘One should no more rack one’s brain about the problem
of whether something one cannot know anything about exists all the same, than about the
ancient question of how many angels are able to sit on the point of a needle.’ For decades
this was the ‘fall-back’ position of most physicists: They’d try to sell you answer 2, but if
you were persistent they’d switch to 3 and terminate the conversation [18].
Incidentally, Grifﬁths goes on to suggest (just like Zeilinger) that certain experiments
(pertaining to something called Bell’s Theorem that is the subject of our Chap.8) have
recently “eliminated agnosticism as a viable option” and have “conﬁrmed decisively
the orthodox interpretation.” About this, Grifﬁths is (like Zeilinger) simply wrong (in
part because of an unnecessarily restrictive conception of the “realist” alternative);
this will become clearer in the following two chapters.
In his overall characterization of the three options, however, Grifﬁths is admirably
open and reasonable; many textbooks don’t even acknowledge something like option

6.6 Contemporary Perspectives

1 but instead just insist dogmatically that some superposition of 2 and 3 is the ﬁnal
truth, handed down from on high by Bohr, and not to be questioned. The ﬁnal quoted
sentence above is also, in my experience, perfectly accurate about the attitude of
most physicists: they know they are supposed to believe 2 and so will do some
minimal amount of due diligence trying to propagandize on behalf of the Copenhagen
interpretation; but at the end of the day they don’t take it too seriously and frankly
don’t really care and are perfectly content to just stop talking about it.
This pragmatic attitude was brilliantly captured by N. David Mermin, who wrote
in a 1989 essay in Physics Today:
If I were forced to sum up in one sentence what the Copenhagen interpretation says to me,
it would be ‘Shut up and calculate! [19].
This is probably the best – certainly the briefest – summary of how most physi-
cists today understand “the Copenhagen interpretation”. It captures perfectly the
typical physicist’s impatience for idle philosophical speculation and desire to get
on with obviously practical things like using the theory to calculate predictions for
how measurements should come out, and then testing those predictions with actual
experiments.
Of course, this attitude is rather contrary to the point of view adopted in the present
book. One should not, however, regard this as an endorsement of “idle philosoph-
ical speculation”. Just the opposite, in fact. There is, I think, a deep irony in the
fact that “Shut up and calculate!” is almost always deployed against people who
want to criticize the orthodox, Copenhagen interpretation and construct an alterna-
tive theory that, for example, resolves the measurement problem. Such alternative
theories typically postulate new sorts of microscopic objects, obeying new dynami-
cal equations, in terms of which a uniform and coherent description of microscopic
processes might be shown (through calculations!) to become possible. It is very
surprising that physicists who value precisely-formulated theories and the calcula-
tions these make possible would prefer Bohr’s philosophical speeches rather than the
more hard-headed alternative theories we will cover in the remainder of the book.
In a rational world, that is, “Shut up and calculate!” is what the critics should say to
the Copenhagenists, whose dogmatic (yet simultaneously unserious) attachment to
Bohr’s philosophy prevents them from even asking the kinds of questions that might
lead to real practical advances.
Clearly there are some deep issues – philosophical issues about the proper goals
of science and sociological issues about how the physics community deals with dis-
agreements over what questions are legitimate – that we will not be able to answer
here. But one thing is for sure: to whatever extent the Copenhagen philosophy insists
that it is not merely wrong, but impossible, to provide a uniform, coherent, realistic
description of the world, which is nevertheless consistent with all known experimen-
tal facts, the Copenhagen philosophy is in that regard simply wrong. Several such
candidate theories exist. Exploring them will occupy us for most of the rest of the
book, starting, in the next chapter, with the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and Bohm,
which provides a stark, eye-opening contrast to the Copenhagen interpretation.

The Copenhagen Interpretation
Projects:
6.1 Read the published version of Bohr’s Como lecture [1] and report back on any
aspects that you ﬁnd surprising, interesting, novel, or illuminating.
6.2 In one of the passages quoted in Sect.6.2, Heisenberg writes, about the quantum
mechanical wave function:
This probability function represents a mixture of two things, partly a fact and partly
our knowledge of a fact. It represents a fact in so far as it assigns at the initial time the
probability unity (i.e., complete certainty) to the initial situation: the electron moving
with the observed velocity at the observed position; ‘observed’ means observed within
the accuracy of the experiment. It represents our knowledge in so far as another observer
could perhaps know the position of the electron more accurately. The error in the
experiment does – at least to some extent – not represent a property of the electron
but a deﬁciency in our knowledge of the electron. Also this deﬁciency of knowledge is
expressed in the probability function [5].
Here Heisenberg wants to draw a distinction between the fundamental, irre-
ducible type of uncertainty (described by his famous uncertainty relations) and
the ordinary type of uncertainty that arises from, for example, imperfect mea-
surements. Does Heisenberg’s position here leave him open to the criticism
that, if the same physical situation can be described by two different quantum
mechanical wave functions (based on different amounts of uncertainty in at
least the second sense), the quantum mechanical descriptions of physical states
cannot be complete? Explain.
6.3 Do you think Bohr would agree with Heisenberg’s suggestion that “another
observer could perhaps know the position of the electron more accurately”?
Explain.
6.4 What, according to Heisenberg, is the difference between the use of probabili-
ties in classical physics, and their use in quantum mechanics?
6.5 Read Heisenberg’s essay on “The Copenhagen Interpretation” [5] and report
back on anything you ﬁnd surprising, interesting, novel, or illuminating.
6.6 Read Bohr’s “Discussion with Einstein...” [6] paper and report back on anything
you ﬁnd surprising, interesting, novel, or illuminating.
6.7 Show that, as claimed in Bohr’s analysis of the two-slit experiment discussed in
Sect.6.3, the spacing x between adjacent interference maxima (see Fig.6.2)
is λL/d.
6.8 In a 1979 paper [20], Wootters and Zurek provide a more detailed and quanti-
tative analysis of the 2-slit experiment discussed in Sect.6.3. Read their paper
and summarize their arguments and conclusions.
6.9 Richard Feynman discusses the 2-slit experiment and its interpretation in Ref.
[21]. How does Feynman’s philosophical attitude toward quantum mechanics
relate to the Copenhagen interpretation?
6.10 In the text it was suggested that (in his 1949 reminiscence) Bohr had mis-
understood or misrepresented Einstein’s 1930 photon box argument. Do you
think Bohr might also have misunderstood/misrepresented Einstein’s argu-
ments regarding the diffraction and interference experiments we discussed in

6.6 Contemporary Perspectives
173
Section 6.3? If so, explain how those arguments could be reformulated in a
way that makes it clearer how they anticipate the 1935 EPR argument. If not,
explain why the diffraction/interference examples are importantly different.
6.11 Work through the mathematical details of Bohr’s analysis of the photon box
experiment. (You might need or want to do a little independent research to
understand the general relativistic formula for gravitational time-dilation.)
6.12 In Ref. [22], Dieks and Lam present a detailed analysis of Einstein’s “photon
box” thought experiment. Read their paper and summarize their arguments
and conclusions. (Note that this requires a familiarity with operators and their
commutators that is slightly beyond the level required elsewhere in this book.)
6.13 Commentators on the Einstein–Bohr debates often characterize Einstein as
a kind of stubborn old conservative who simply couldn’t get with the new
quantum program. For example, Heisenberg wrote:
Most scientists are willing to accept new empirical data and to recognize new results,
provided they ﬁt into their philosophical framework. But in the course of scientiﬁc
progress it can happen that a new range of empirical data can be completely understood
only when the enormous effort is made to enlarge this framework and to change the
very structure of the thought process. In the case of quantum mechanics, Einstein was
apparently no longer willing to take this step, or perhaps no longer able to do so [23].
And Max Born wrote:
Atﬁrsttherewerequiteanumberofseriousscientistswhodidnotwanttoknowanything
about the theory of relativity; conservative individuals, who were unable to free their
minds from the prevailing philosophical principles.... Einstein himself belonged to this
group in later years; he could no longer take in certain new ideas in physics which
contradicted his own ﬁrmly held philosophical convictions [23].
What do you think of this? Of the two interlocutors, Einstein and Bohr, which
one was really open to new theoretical concepts, and which one insisted on
preserving old ideas, come what may?
6.14 Read Bohr’s reply [9] to the EPR paper and report on anything you ﬁnd sur-
prising, interesting, novel, or illuminating.
6.15 In his reply [9] to EPR, Bohr provides a concrete kind of setup which would
give rise to something like the entangled EPR state, in which “a subsequent
single measurement of either of the position or of the momentum of one of the
particles will automatically determine the position or momentum, respectively,
of the other particle with any desired accuracy.” What does he say about this
and how would Einstein reply?
6.16 Interview some physicists about the Copenhagen interpretation. Ask them
whether they basically agree with it. Then ask them to summarize what it says.
You might also ask them speciﬁcally about whether Bohr successfully refuted
the EPR argument and, if so, how the refutation works exactly. Summarize and
share your ﬁndings.
6.17 The Wikipedia page on the Copenhagen interpretation provides (as of this
writing) the following supposedly Copenhagen response to Schrödinger’s cat:
“The wave function reﬂects our knowledge of the system. The wave function

174

The Copenhagen Interpretation
[ 1
√
2 (ψalive + ψdead)] means that, once the cat is observed, there is a 50% chance
it will be dead, and 50% chance it will be alive.” Do you think this accurately
captures what Bohr would have said about Schrödinger’s cat?
6.17 The Wikipedia page on the Copenhagen interpretation provides (as of this writ-
ing) the following supposedly Copenhagen response to the EPR argument:
“Assuming wave functions are not real, wave-function collapse is interpreted
subjectively. The moment one observer measures the spin of one particle, he
knows the spin of the other. However, another observer cannot beneﬁt until
the results of that measurement have been relayed to him, at less than or equal
to the speed of light.” Do you think this provides a fair summary of Bohr’s
response to EPR?
6.18 What do you think Bohr would have thought about the slogan “Shut up and cal-
culate!”? It might be helpful to do some research here regarding Bohr’s thoughts
about the applicability of “complementarity” outside of physics; see, for exam-
ple, Mara Beller’s “The Sokal Hoax: At Whom are we Laughing?” [24].

Chapter 7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
According to the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics, the theory provides
– already, with wave functions alone – complete descriptions of physical states.
In Chaps.3–5 we reviewed three distinct but inter-related problems that afﬂict this
view, at least according to people like Einstein, Schrödinger, and Bell. The alleged
problems could be summarized by saying that there seems to be something deﬁcient
about quantum mechanical wave functions as descriptions of physical reality – either
(at best) the wave functions provide only an incomplete description of what is actually
going on physically, or (at worst) they fail to provide any comprehensible description
of physically real processes at all.
Bohr and Heisenberg, of course, did not accept the criticisms and built a rather
elaborate philosophical ediﬁce in support of the claim that the theory is not only
perfectly rational and comprehensible, but indeed complete. Their arguments, how-
ever, were never very convincing to the critics. For example, in 1949 (that is, well
after the debates that led up to and followed the Schrödinger’s Cat and EPR episodes
of 1935), Einstein wrote that “the statistical quantum theory does not pretend to
describe the individual system (and its development in time) completely”. And so,
Einstein said, “it appears unavoidable to look elsewhere for a complete description
of the individual system....” From the point of view of a theory that did “accomplish
a complete physical description”, “the statistical quantum theory would ... take an
approximately analogous position to the statistical mechanics within the framework
of classical mechanics [1].”
The current chapter presents a concrete example of a theory of this sort – one
which purports to complete the usual quantum mechanical description of physical
states(byaddingsomethingnew).Thetheorywasﬁrstproposed,butthenprematurely
abandoned, by de Broglie in the mid 1920s [2]. The theory was then independently
rediscovered and further developed by David Bohm in 1952 (and is therefore some-
times called “Bohmian Mechanics”) [3]. Bell, who championed the theory until his
untimely death in 1990, gave a very nice overview of its basic idea when he wrote:

The Pilot-Wave Theory
While the founding fathers agonized over the question
‘particle’ or ‘wave’
de Broglie in 1925 proposed the obvious answer
‘particle’ and ‘wave’.
Is it not clear from the smallness of the scintillation on the screen that we have to do with a
particle? And is it not clear, from the diffraction and interference patterns, that the motion
of the particle is directed by a wave? De Broglie showed in detail how the motion of a
particle, passing through just one of two holes in [a] screen, could be inﬂuenced by waves
propagating through both holes. And so inﬂuenced that the particle does not go where the
waves cancel out, but is attracted to where they cooperate. This idea seems to me so natural
and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is
a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored. Of the founding fathers, only Einstein
thought that de Broglie was on the right lines. Discouraged, de Broglie abandoned his picture
for many years. He took it up again only when it was rediscovered, and more systematically
presented, in 1952, by David Bohm. .... There is no need in this picture to divide the world
into ‘quantum’ and ‘classical’ parts. For the necessary ‘classical terms’ are available already
for individual particles (their actual positions) and so also for macroscopic assemblies of
particles [4].
Let’s try to understand in more detail what this theory says and how it works.
7.1
Overview
According to the de Broglie - Bohm pilot-wave theory, most of the puzzles and para-
doxes of orthodox quantum mechanics arise from its using incomplete state descrip-
tions. It is not, for example, that electrons are wave-like when not being observed,
but then magically “collapse” to sharp positions when looked at. Instead, according
to the pilot-wave theory, the electron is always a particle with a sharp position fol-
lowing a deﬁnite trajectory through space; the statistical wave-like phenomena (such
as the build-up of the interference pattern in the two-slit experiment) arise because
the motion of the particle is inﬂuenced by an associated wave. This is sometimes
hard for people to understand because they are so accustomed, in ordinary quantum
mechanics, to describing “particles” (like electrons) in terms of wave functions. So
let me repeat it for emphasis: a single electron, according to the pilot-wave theory,
is not one thing, but two – a wave and a (literal, pointlike) particle whose motion is
controlled by the wave.
To formulate the theory in a rigorous way, we need to know the dynamical laws
obeyed by both the wave and the particle. For the wave this is easy, because the
wave is nothing but the ordinary quantum mechanical wave function  obeying
Schrödinger’s equation:
iℏ∂
∂t = ˆH.
(7.1)
So that part is familiar and straightforward.

7.1 Overview
179
But what about the motion of the particle? Here we can take a clue from the de
Broglie formula
p = h
λ = ℏk
(7.2)
which relates the momentum p of the particle with the wavelength λ (or wave num-
ber k) of the associated wave. (Note that this equation is very difﬁcult to understand
unless there genuinely exist two things: a wave and a particle!) This suggests that
when the wave function is a plane-wave  ∼eikx with a deﬁnite wave number k,
the particle should move with velocity
v = p
m = ℏ
m k.
(7.3)
But what should the velocity be in the general case, where the wave function is not
of this very special plane-wave type, and hence has no single well-deﬁned wave
number k?
The following seems like the simplest way of generalizing the last equation. Write
the wave function in “polar form” (x, t) = R(x, t)eiS(x,t) (so that R is the modulus
and S is the phase of the wave function) and then let
v = ℏ
m
∂S
∂x .
(7.4)
For the plane-wave type solution, S(x, t) = kx and so Eq. (7.4) reduces to Eq. (7.3).
But Eq.(7.4) makes sense in general, for any (x, t). Well, except for one thing: for
a generic wave function (x, t), the gradient of the phase (∂S/∂x) will be a function
of x and t. So where, exactly, should we evaluate the function to give the velocity
of the particle? The obvious answer is: evaluate it at the actual location X(t) of the
particle! We will thus consider the following as the simplest possible candidate law
describing how the particle moves under the inﬂuence of the wave:
d X(t)
dt
= ℏ
m
∂S(x, t)
∂x

x=X(t)
(7.5)
where S(x, t) is the complex phase of the wave function. Note that this can be
equivalently re-written (in terms of the wave function itself) as follows:
d X(t)
dt
= ℏ
m Im
 ∂
∂x



x=X(t)
.
(7.6)
where “Im” means “the imaginary part”.
That is basically all there is to the theory: a single electron (for example) is a wave
and a particle, with the wave just obeying Schrödinger’s equation and the particle
moving, under the inﬂuence of the wave, according to Eq.(7.6). There is one other

aspect of the theory, though, that we will develop and explain here even though, in
some sense, it is less fundamental. This has to do with how probabilities arise and
are understood and explained in the theory.
Let’s begin by reviewing/recalling an important fact about Schrödinger’s equation,
here, for simplicity, for a single particle moving in one dimension:
iℏ∂
∂t = −ℏ2
2m

∂x2 + V (x, t).

The complex conjugate of Schrödinger’s equation reads:
−iℏ∂∗

∂2∗
∂x2 + V (x, t)∗.
(7.8)
(Note that we assume here that the potential energy V (x, t) is real.) Now multiply
Eq.(7.7) by ∗, multiply Eq.(7.8) by , and subtract the second from the ﬁrst. The
result is

This has the form of the so-called “continuity equation”
∂ρ
∂t = −∂
∂x j
(7.11)
or, in three dimensions,
∂ρ
∂t = −⃗∇· ⃗j.
(7.12)
This continuity equation is satisﬁed, for example, in electrodynamics by the electric
charge density ρ and the electric current density ⃗j. In this context, we think of
the continuity equation as expressing the local conservation of charge: a positive
divergence of ⃗j at some point, which implies a net outward ﬂow of electric charge
away from that point, corresponds to a negative ∂ρ
∂t , i.e., a decreasing charge density
at the point.
So in the same way, Eq.(7.10) can be understood as expressing the local conser-
vation of probability because we recognize ||2 as the standard expression for the
probability density (of ﬁnding the particle, if we look for it) in quantum mechanics.
We thus identify

as the “quantum probability current”.
The fact that Schrödinger’s equation implies that ||2 obeys the continuity equa-
tion (with the ⃗j just given) is a completely standard (if slightly advanced) principle
of orthodox quantum mechanics which has nothing in particular to do with the pilot-
wave theory. But it relates to the pilot-wave theory in two (related!) ways.
First, recall that in electrodynamics the electrical current density (associated with,
say, a single charged particle) is just the charge density multiplied by the particle’s
velocity: ⃗j = ρ⃗v. And so one can write the velocity as the ratio of the current and
charge densities like this:
⃗v =
⃗j
ρ.
(7.15)
Now, in orthodox quantum mechanics, we have a probability density ρ = ||2 and
probability current ⃗j. Of course, in orthodox quantum mechanics, there are no (lit-
eral) particles, but only wave functions. But – given orthodox quantum mechanics
– if you wanted to propose that, in addition to the wave function, there is also a
(literal) particle, it would be very natural and obvious – based on the analogy with
electrodynamics – to guess that the velocity might be given by
⃗v =

But it is now easy to see that this is yet another way of re-writing the equation, that

The Pilot-Wave Theory
So that is the ﬁrst reason for going into the quantum continuity equation here:
it gives another illuminating perspective on the pilot-wave theory’s new dynamical
postulate (for how the particles should move).
The second reason is that it makes it possible to understand something about
probability in the theory. In general, according to the pilot-wave theory, every particle
is always deﬁnitely somewhere. But we do not usually know the exact location!
Indeed, if we experimentally prepare an electron to have wave function (x, 0), we
cannot pick or control the exact initial particle position X(0) – this will therefore
be random, and one might expect that there should be some associated probability
distribution P(x, 0) to characterize this. But since we have already committed to
a speciﬁc formula for the velocity that particles at various positions x and times t
would have, it is clear that the initial probability distribution P(x, 0) will change in
time. It is possible to show that the probability distribution P(x, t) should satisfy
∂P(x, t)
∂t
= −∂
∂x [ v(x, t) P(x, t) ]
(7.20)
(see the Projects). But then one can see that P(x, t) = |(x, t)|2 is a special, equi-
librium probability distribution for the pilot-wave theory, in the following sense:
if P(x, 0) = |(x, 0)|2 at the initial time (t = 0), then we will have P(x, t) =
|(x, t)|2 for all times. This is often described in the literature by saying that the
distribution P = ||2 is “equivariant”. The proof of this is just the following: if
P = ||2 and v = j/||2, then Eq.(7.20) reduces to the continuity equation, Eq.
(7.10), which we already showed is satisﬁed as a consequence of Schrödinger’s
equation.
There is a lot more that can be said about how to understand the quantum proba-
bilities in the pilot-wave theory. One of the theory’s main virtues is that something
like the Born rule can be genuinely derived (from the basic dynamical postulates
of the theory) rather than merely posited as an additional axiom. What we have just
been explaining is a part (but only a part) of that derivation, but it would be too
big a distraction to go any deeper into this. So for our purposes here it will have
to sufﬁce to think about the theory in something like the following way: at some
cosmological initial time t = 0, the wave function was 0 and the particle positions
were selected, randomly, according to the ||2 distribution at that initial time. It then
follows, from the two dynamical postulates of the theory, that we – today, inside the
universe – should see particle positions that are distributed according to the Born
rule: P(x, t) = |(x, t)|2.
We will illustrate these ideas with a concrete example in the following section.
7.2
Particle in a Box
Let’s try to see more clearly how the pilot-wave theory works by considering the
simple example of a (one-dimensional) particle-in-a-box (PIB). Suppose to begin
with that the system is in the ground state so that

7.2 Particle in a Box
183
(x, t) = ψ1(x)e−i E1t/ℏ.
(7.21)
Since ψ1(x) =

2
L sin(πx/L) is purely real, the complex phase associated with 
is just
S(x, t) = −i E1t/ℏ.
(7.22)
This doesn’t depend on x at all, so the particle velocity, according to Eq.(7.5), is
zero. The particle, that is, just sits there at rest. This, as it turns out, is characteristic
of so-called stationary states, which are indeed aptly named according to this theory.
Note that this applies also to some more interesting and realistic situations: for
example, the electron in a Hydrogen atom in its ground state is not, according to the
pilot-wave theory, orbiting the proton, but is instead just sitting there, at some ﬁxed
point near the proton. If that bothers you or seems physically impossible, you are
probably tacitly expecting that if the electron is literally a particle, it should obey
Newton’s equations of motion, and should therefore accelerate toward the proton
due to the electrostatic force. But the pilot-wave theory is not classical mechanics!
The motion of the particle, according to this theory, is not determined by classical
forces acting on it, but is instead determined by the structure of the wave function
which guides it.
To see some non-trivial dynamics in the particle-in-a-box system, we need only
let the quantum state be a superposition of energy eigenstates. For example, suppose
the wave function is given by
(x, t) =
1

ψ1(x)e−i E1t/ℏ+ ψ2(x)e−i E2t/ℏ

sin(πx/L)e−iω1t + sin(2πx/L)e−iω2t
.
(7.23)
It is slightly cumbersome here to put this in polar form, but straightforward to use
Eq.(7.6) to express the particle velocity as a function of its position:

(7.24)
This is a bit of a messy ﬁrst-order differential equation, but it’s easy enough to let
Mathematica solve it numerically. See Fig.7.1 for some example world lines.
Basically, what happens is that – as the wave intensity sloshes back and forth
within the box (as we saw in Chap.2) – the particle is pushed back and forth with it.
The ensemble of trajectories in Fig.7.1 is, however, a little uneven and funny-looking
because we have chosen an ensemble in which the initial positions X(0) are equally
spaced, i.e., the initial distribution P(x) is constant. One can see in the ﬁgure that
the distribution then becomes very non-constant (with several trajectories bunching
closely together) after a short period of time.

184

The Pilot-Wave Theory
Fig. 7.1 The blue curves are a set of possible worldlines for a particle-in-a-box with wave function
an equally-weighted superposition of the n = 1 and n = 2 energy eigenstates. (This is a space-
time diagram, with the horizontal axis being the position x within the box, and the vertical axis
representing the time t.) Note that at t = 0 the example trajectories are equally-spaced across the
box. If we think of this as an ensemble of trajectories, we would say that the initial distribution
P(x) is constant. But then the distribution at later times is not constant, as illustrated by the rather
extreme “clumping up” of the world lines. The distribution P is graphed, as a function of x, at two
different times: see the green curves that live on the grey axes, whose vertical location is meant to
indicate the time. The associated red curves show what ||2 looks like at these same times
As described in the last section, however, there is a special distribution whose
functional form is preserved in time. This is the distribution P = ||2 in which the
number of trajectories in the ensemble is proportional to the “intensity” ||2 of (i.e.,
what is in orthodox QM thought of as the “probability density” associated with)
the wave function . The claim, then, is that if we have an ensemble of particles
(all moving under the inﬂuence of the same wave function (x, t)) with, at t = 0,
the distribution P(x, 0) = |(x, 0)|2, then it follows from Eqs.(7.1) and (7.6) that
P(x, t) = |(x, t)|2 for all t. As mentioned before, this property is sometimes called
the “equivariance” of the ||2 distribution.
The equivariance property is illustrated in Fig.7.2, which is the same as Fig.7.1
except that now the distribution of initial positions X(0) is given by |(x, 0)|2. One
can see that, indeed, the distribution continues to be given by |(x, t)|2 for later
times.

7.2 Particle in a Box
185
Fig. 7.2 Same as Fig.7.1
but for an ensemble of initial
positions X(0) that are
distributed with
P(x, 0) = |(x, 0)|2. This
illustrates the “equivariance”
property discussed in the
previous section: if the
positions of particles in the
ensemble are
||2-distributed at t = 0,
then they will remain
||2-distributed for all time.
So the green
curves(indicating P) and the
red curves(indicating ||2)
coincide at all times here,
unlike the situation depicted
in the previous ﬁgure
So, this example illustrates all of the main ideas of the pilot-wave theory: a quan-
tum system is a hybrid of particle-and-wave, with the wave being simply the usual
wave function obeying Schrödinger’s equation. The particle has a random initial posi-
tion within the wave, and this position then evolves in time according to the guidance
equation (which we have written in several mathematically equivalent forms). The
motion of the particle is indeed well-captured by Bell’s statement that the particle
“is attracted to where [the contributions to ] cooperate”, i.e., where there is con-
structive interference, i.e., where ||2 is large. For example, here, at t = 0 ||2 is
large on the left side of the box and small on the right, but after a short period of time
||2 becomes small on the left and large on the right; the particles thus move from
left to right to “follow” ||2.
7.3
Other Single Particle Examples
Let’s review a couple of other examples to get a sense of how the theory works.
Consider, to start, the spreading Gaussian wave packet from Chap.2. We saw that if,
at t = 0, the wave function is given by

186
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
(x, 0) = Ne−x2/4σ2
(7.25)
then
(x, t) = N(t) e−x2/4(σ2+iℏt/2m).
(7.26)
where N(t) is a time- (but not position-) dependent complex normalization constant.
We can put this in “polar form” by multiplying (inside the argument of the exponen-
tial) by the complex conjugate of (σ2 + iℏt/2m) divided by itself. This gives
(x, t) = N(t) exp

−x2σ2
4(σ4 + ℏ2t2/4m2)

exp

ix2ℏt
8m(σ4 + ℏ2t2/4m2)

.
(7.27)
So we can identify the complex phase S(x, t) of the wave function as1
S(x, t) =
x2ℏt
8m(σ4 + ℏ2t2/4m2).
(7.28)
Plugging this into Eq.(7.5) gives the following ﬁrst-order differential equation for
the position X(t) of a particle being guided by this spreading Gaussian packet:
d X(t)
dt
= X(t)
t
t2 + 4m2σ4/ℏ2 .
(7.29)
It is not hard to show that this differential equation is solved by
X(t) = X0

(7.30)
which can be re-written as
	 X(t)
X0

= 1.
(7.31)
This is the equation for a hyperbola, and so it turns out that the spreading Gaussian
wave packet has the nice feature that the world lines of particles are hyperbolae.
Some example trajectories are shown in Fig.7.3.
To summarize this ﬁrst example, when an initially narrow wave packet spreads,
as of course occurs for example in the phenomenon we call diffraction, according
to the pilot-wave theory the possible particle trajectories also spread out from one
another, as one would expect on the basis of the equivariance property.
1Technically, there is also a contribution to the complex phase from what I called N(t), but since
that only depends on time, and we ultimately only care about the derivative of S(x, t) with respect to
x, I am just ignoring that other contribution. What’s written here, then, is really just the x-dependent
part of S(x, t).

7.3 Other Single Particle Examples
187
Fig. 7.3 Representative sample of particle trajectories for a spreading Gaussian wave packet. Here
time runs to the right and x runs vertically (so it is a space-time diagram turned sideways). Or one
can, in the spirit of Fig.2.6, consider replacing t with a second spatial coordinate, and hence think
of the lines as showing the trajectories through space that particles would follow downstream of a
single Gaussian slit. That is, the ﬁgure can be understood as showing the trajectories that particles
would follow when being guided by a diffracting wave function. Note that the distribution of initial
particle positions X(0) here is given by |(x, 0)2|, so (by “equivariance”) the trajectories spread
out from one another so as to keep P = ||2 for subsequent times
We can use a similar technique to visualize the possible particle trajectories in the
case of two-slit interference. Beginning with a superposition of two Gaussian wave
packets (centered at x = a and x = −a) we showed already in Chap.2, Eq.(2.57),
that
(x, t) = N(t)

(x−a)2
4(σ2+iℏt/2m) + e
−
(x+a)2
4(σ2+iℏt/2m)

.
(7.32)
This is a little harder to write explicitly in “polar” form (although there is a reasonably
simple way of writing S(x, t) explicitly). And the differential equation one gets for
X(t) has nothing as simple as hyperbolae as solutions. The only hope, really, is to
solve the differential equation for X(t) numerically using a computer. See Fig.7.4
for the beautiful results!
There are a number of other simple example scenarios for which it is illuminating
to consider the particle trajectories as posited by the pilot-wave theory. See, for
example, the Projects for references to two papers which analyze (i) a simple case
of reﬂection and transmission at a potential step and the case of quantum tunneling
through a classically-forbidden region and (ii) the pilot-wave theory’s account of spin
and its measurement in for example a Stern–Gerlach type apparatus. But hopefully
the examples discussed above already give you a fairly clear sense of how the theory
works in simple situations. So let us then turn to exploring some other important
aspects of the theory.

188

The Pilot-Wave Theory
Fig. 7.4 Representative sample of particle trajectories for the case of two initially-separated
Gaussian wave-packets. As in the previous ﬁgure, this is technically a space-time diagram turned
sideways – but one may also legitimately think of it as showing the trajectories, through space, of
particles which have just emerged, moving to the right, through a double- (Gaussian) slit screen.
This type of image, of the particle trajectories for the double-slit experiment according to the pilot-
wave theory, was ﬁrst presented in Ref. [5] and has become iconic for the pilot-wave theory because
it captures so clearly, in a picture, how the theory explains the (otherwise) puzzling wave-particle-
duality. The discrete ﬂashes on the detection screen correspond to places where (literal, pointlike)
particles collide with the screen; but the highly non-classical motion of the particles is inﬂuenced
by the accompanying pilot-wave such that the particle trajectories bunch up around points of con-
structive interference. An ensemble of such trajectories (with suitably random initial conditions)
will therefore perfectly account (in, to use Bell’s phrase, “a clear and ordinary way” [4]) for the
type of statistical interference pattern we saw in Fig.2.8
7.4
Measurement
We assumed, in our discussion of the one-particle examples above, that if we make
a position measurement at some time t when the wave function is (x, t) and the
actual particle position is X(t), we will see the particle where it is. For example, if
a particular particle in the double slit experiment is following one of the trajectories
shown in Fig.7.4, we will see a “ﬂash” on the detection screen right where the particle
runs into it, i.e., at the location where the trajectory it’s following intersects the screen
(on, for example, the right of the ﬁgure).
But probably the most important virtue of the pilot-wave theory is that we do not
need to divide up the world into “quantum system” (which we describe using the
theory) and “classical environment” (which we take for granted and make uncon-
trolled assumptions about) in order to understand measurements and their outcomes.
Instead, we are free (indeed, required!) to enlarge the “quantum system” (which we
describe using the theory) until it includes literally everything – the entire universe.
This is of course in contrast to ordinary quantum mechanics which, as we discussed
in detail in Chap.3, seems to require one to introduce what Bell called a “shifty

7.4 Measurement
189
split” (i.e., an artiﬁcial division of the world into distinct “quantum” and “classical”
realms, with special ad hoc exceptions to the usual dynamical rules when the two
realms interact). The claim, then, is that unlike orthodox quantum mechanics, the
pilot-wave theory is not afﬂicted with a “measurement problem.”
Let us discuss this in terms of the simple example, from Chap.3, in which the
energyofaparticle-in-a-box(withdegreeoffreedom x)ismeasured,andtheoutcome
displayed in the position of a “pointer” (with degree of freedom y). As discussed
back in that chapter, a schematic interaction Hamiltonian
ˆHint = λ ˆHx ˆpy
(7.33)
can be shown to generate the expected kind of behavior, namely, that if the initial
wave function is given by
(x, y, 0) = ψn(x)φ(y)
(7.34)
(where ψn(x) is the nth energy eigenstate of the particle-in-a-box and φ(y) is
a gaussian wave packet centered at y = 0, the “ready” position of the pointer),
Schrödinger’s equation will give the time-evolved wave function
(x, y, t) = ψn(x)φ(y −λEnt)
(7.35)
in which the wave packet for the pointer has moved a distance proportional to the
energy En of the particle in the box. In short, the post-interaction position of the
pointer registers the actual energy En of the particle-in-the-box... just as it should if
the process is going to be described as a measurement of that energy!
The trouble arose when we considered what happens if the particle-in-a-box
starts out in a superposition of different energy eigenstates. From the linearity of
Schrödinger’s equation, it is clear that if
(x, y, 0) =

i
ciψi(x)

φ(y)
(7.36)
then we will have
(x, y, t) =

i
ciψi(x)φ(y −λEit).
(7.37)
That is, instead of having a well-deﬁned post-interaction position which we can
interpret as registering the (single, well-deﬁned) outcome of the measurement, the
pointer itself becomes “infected” with the quantum superposition. That is, the ﬁnal
state is a superposition of terms like: “the particle is in the ground state and the pointer
indicates E = E1”, but also “the particle is in the ﬁrst excited state and the pointer
indicates E = E2”, and so on. The wave function alone fails to pick out a particular
result; instead it contains, so to speak, all possible results in parallel. But since in an

190
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
actual measurement of this kind we always observe a single, deﬁnite result, it seems
that the wave function alone is inadequate to account for our observations. That, in
a nutshell, was the measurement problem.
How does the pilot-wave theory resolve the problem, given that, as we have
said, the theory also says that there is a wave function which obeys Schrödinger’s
equation? It is true that, according to the pilot-wave theory, the PIB-pointer system
has a wave function that ends up in the state described by Eq. (7.37). But the crucial
idea is that, according to the pilot-wave theory, the wave function alone does not
provide a complete description of the physical situation. There is, in addition, the
actual position X(t) of the PIB and – crucially here – the actual position Y(t) of the
pointer.
Let’s think a little bit about what the theory says these actual particle positions
do. The details are a little bit complicated (mostly because of the somewhat unusual
form of the interaction Hamiltonian) so I’ll save those for the Projects at the end of
the chapter. But, in principle, the idea is simple: the position X(t) of the particle-in-
the-box evolves according to
d X(t)
dt
=
jx
||2
(7.38)
where jx is the x-component of the quantum probability current associated with this
system. Similarly, the position Y(t) of the pointer evolves according to
dY(t)
dt
=
jy
||2
(7.39)
where jy is the y-component of the probability current. And at some level you don’t
really need to worry about what, exactly, the trajectories look like, because you know
– from the equivariance property – that if the initial values X(0) and Y(0) start out
random (and suitably distributed) the positions will remain ||2-distributed for all
times. And so the positions X(t) and Y(t) later on will be random and they will in
particular lie somewhere in the support of (x, y, t). Let’s think qualitatively about
what that means.
Figure7.5 shows a “cartoon” representation of how the wave function (x, y, t)
evolves in time as the measurement interaction proceeds. At t = 0, the wave function
has support between x = 0 and x = L and for y ≈0. But as time goes on, the
superposed terms in  move, in the y-direction, by different amounts, so that after a
while the wave function has support in a set of discrete, non-overlapping “islands” of
theconﬁgurationspace.Buttheparticles havedeﬁnitepositions X(t)andY(t)which,
together, can be understood as deﬁning an “actual conﬁguration point” which traces
out some kind of trajectory through conﬁguration space. (I’ve indicated a possible
beginning and end to this trajectory in the ﬁgure by putting a dot at {X(0), Y(0)}
on the left and {X(t), Y(t)} on the right.) The exact trajectory will be, in general,
rather twisted and complicated: as the several wave function “islands” slide across
one another (in the process of going from their initial, stacked conﬁguration, to their
ﬁnal, separated, conﬁguration) there is a complicated interference pattern, somewhat

Fig. 7.5 The graph on the left highlights (in dark gray) the region of the two-dimensional con-
ﬁguration space where (x, y, 0) has support. Later, at time t, the wave function has split apart
into several non-overlapping “islands”. This is depicted in the graph on the right. The simultaneous
presence of all these islands constitutes, for orthodox quantum mechanics, the measurement prob-
lem. But for the pilot-wave theory, the actually-realized outcome of the measurement is not to be
found in the wave function, but rather in the ﬁnal position of the pointer. And this, in the pilot-wave
theory, will be some one (random but perfectly deﬁnite) value, indicated here by the vertical position
Y(t) of the dot which represents the actual conﬁguration point (X, Y). The indicated Y(t) is in the
support of the n = 2 branch of the wave function – i.e., Y(t) is approximately λE2t – so we would
say in this case that the energy measurement had the outcome E = E2. Note that the outcome might
have been different had the (random) initial positions X(0) and Y(0) been different
like the one that makes the particle trajectories bend this way and that in the double
slit setup. But as the “islands” cease to overlap, things calm down, and the actual
conﬁguration point {X(t), Y(t)} ﬁnds itself in one or the other of the islands. And
so, in particular, the pointer has some speciﬁc post-interaction position, Y(t) which
is either approximately λE1t, or λE2t, or λE3t, etc. So, at the end of the experiment,
the position of the pointer is in no way “blurry” or “indeﬁnite” or “superposed”. The
pointer has a deﬁnite position which corresponds to exactly one of the energy values
we regard as possible outcomes of the experiment.
Indeed, note that, by the equivariance property (and, again, assuming the initial
positions X(0) and Y(0) are suitably random), the probability for the ﬁnal conﬁg-
uration point {X(t), Y(t)} to lie in the nth “island” is equal to the integral of ||2
across that island. But this is simply |cn|2 – the very thing we would have identiﬁed,
according to the textbook quantum rules, as the probability for the measurement to
have the nth outcome. So the pilot-wave theory reproduces the statistical predictions
of ordinary QM. But it does this while treating the system-being-measured and the
measuring apparatus itself, on an equal footing, both as part of a big system that is
described in a uniform way by the theory.
It is perhaps also worth stressing here that the pilot-wave theory generates the same
statistical predictions as ordinary QM, even though the theory is completely deter-
ministic. Recall that in ordinary QM, the Schrödinger equation part of the dynamics is

192
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
completely deterministic; it is the collapse postulate (i.e., the dynamics that momen-
tarily pre-empts the usual Schrödinger evolution when a “measurement” occurs) that
introduces the randomness which results in the theory making statistical predictions.
In the pilot-wave theory, there is no collapse postulate: the wave function obeys the
Schrödinger equation always. And the dynamics describing the motion of the parti-
cles is also completely deterministic. Randomness enters – like in classical statistical
mechanics – only through the initial conditions. Basically, we can never be sure (in
advance) how a quantum measurement will come out, because we can never know
(in sufﬁcient microscopic detail) what the initial positions of all the particles were.
There is much more that can be said about this issue. It turns out, for example,
that the uncertainty (associated with initial particle positions) is unavoidable. If, for
example, you prepare a system to have wave function ψ(x), then the best possible
knowledge that you could in principle have, about the position X of the associated
particle, is (according to the theory) that P(x) = |ψ|2. Thus, although lots of detailed
microscopic structure exists, according to the pilot-wave theory – for example, every
particle in the universe has at every moment a precisely deﬁned position and velocity
– not all of this structure is accessible to us. The theory thus allows us to understand
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle as just that – uncertainty about facts which exist.
This is in contrast to the usual interpretation, in which, to be precise about it, it is not
so much that we are uncertain about these things, but that the things themselves are
objectively indeﬁnite.
Let us develop one more point which ties some of these ideas together. We have
been stressing that in the pilot-wave theory one can – and indeed must – treat every-
thing (ultimately, the whole universe) quantum mechanically. So for example when
a measuring apparatus interacts with some particle (one of whose properties is being
“measured”) we must solve Schrödinger’s equation for the entire system comprising
both the particle and the apparatus. And as we saw, no additional ad hoc postulates
(about “collapse”, etc.) are needed to explain how the measurement has a single,
deﬁnite outcome: although the wave function (for the whole big system) ends up
in an entangled superposition, the particles (being, after all, literal particles) have
deﬁnite positions all the time.
That’s great if one just wants to understand why there is no “measurement prob-
lem” in the pilot-wave theory. But the broader claim is that the pilot-wave theory
reproduces all of the statistical implications of ordinary textbook quantum theory.
And ordinary textbook quantum theory generally does not include measuring devices
in the systems being described quantum mechanically, but instead just talks about
(for example) the PIB whose energy is being measured. And one of the things it
says about the PIB is that the PIB has its own wave function (both before and after
the measurement) and that, during the measurement, this wave function collapses.
So this naturally raises the question: even though there is nothing like a collapse
postulate in the pilot-wave theory, can the theory nevertheless shed some light on
the success and utility of the textbook quantum rules?
The answer is yes, and this is one of the most interesting (and also least appre-
ciated) aspects of the theory. To begin with, note that even though there is in some
sense really only one big wave function in the pilot-wave theory (namely, the wave

7.4 Measurement
193
function of the whole universe) the theory allows one to deﬁne the wave function
for a sub-system. The way to do this is as follows: just evaluate the universal wave
function at the actual locations of all the particles outside the subsystem. For exam-
ple, take the case of the PIB-pointer system we’ve been discussing here. The wave
function for the whole PIB-pointer system is
(x, y, t) =

i
ciψi(x)φ(y −λEit).
(7.40)
By simply evaluating this at y = Y(t) – the actual location of the pointer particle –
one thus has a function which depends only on x and t and can be understood as the
wave function, call it χ(x, t) of the PIB sub-system:
χ(x, t) ∼

i
ciψi(x)φ(Y(t) −λEit).
(7.41)
The “∼” is there, instead of an “=” sign, because it would probably be sensible to
deﬁne the sub-system wave function in such a way that it is properly normalized.
The RHS, however, is not. But this is a minor technical detail that we simply leave
aside for now.
Here is the important thing. At t = 0 (or, in general, before the interaction with
the measuring apparatus is turned on), the PIB sub-system wave function is
χ(x, 0) ∼

i
ciψi(x) φ (Y(0)) ∼

i
ciψi(x)
(7.42)
since φ (Y(0)) is just a constant that doesn’t depend on x or i. This is just what we
would ordinarily have said the PIB’s pre-measurement wave function is, according
to the textbook theory. So that is not too interesting or surprising. But consider what
happens for large t (after, say, the measurement has gone to completion). Recall in
particular that the actual pointer position Y(t) ends up (at random, depending on the
uncontrollable initial conditions) either near λE1t or λE2t or λE3t, etc. That is,
Y(t) ≈λEnt for some particular n which we describe as the actual outcome of the
experiment. But since φ is something like a narrow Gaussian wave packet, this means
that φ(Y(t) −λEit) will be approximately zero for all values of i except i = n, the
one corresponding to the realized outcome. And so this means that, for large t, the
PIB sub-system wave function can be written
χ(x, t) ∼

i
ciψi(x)φ(Y(t) −λEit) ≈cnψn(x)φ(Y(t) −λEnt).
(7.43)
But this is equivalent to saying
χ(x, t) = ψn(x)
(7.44)

194

The Pilot-Wave Theory
since cn and φ (Y(t) −λEnt) are again just constants that don’t depend on x.
Thus, the wave function of the PIB sub-system evolves, during the course of the
interaction with the measuring apparatus, from a superposition of several energy
eigenstates, into the one particular eigenstate that corresponds to the realized out-
come of the experiment. In fact this evolution is perfectly smooth and continuous;
but if the interaction is strong, the evolution will occur rapidly, and one might be for-
given for describing it as apparently discontinuous. The point is, of course, that here
the pilot-wave theory is providing an explanation for the process that is described
in ordinary quantum theory as the collapse of the wave function. But whereas in
ordinary quantum mechanics the collapse is an implausible, ad hoc exception to the
usual dynamical rules, the transition of sub-system wave functions to appropriate
eigenstates during suitable interactions is, in the pilot-wave theory, a consequence
of the standard dynamical rules that apply all of the time.
7.5
Contextuality
In the earlier section, when we were thinking about the pilot-wave theory’s account
of the 2-slit experiment, we assumed that the visible “ﬂash” on the detection screen
occurs where the particle in fact hits the screen. We assumed, that is, that posi-
tion measurements simply reveal the pre-existing positions of the particles. But the
analogous thing does not appear to hold in the case of the energy measurement we
discussed subsequently. The “measurement of the PIB’s energy” had, to be sure, a
deﬁnite outcome – En – but this in no way implied that the PIB somehow secretly
had this particular amount of energy prior to the measurement interaction. Indeed,
it’s not even really clear what that would mean according to the pilot-wave theory:
prior to the interaction with the measuring device, the PIB’s wave function was a
superposition of several energy eigenstates, and the particle had some deﬁnite posi-
tion X within that wave; but there is simply nothing there that would allow us (or
should make us feel the urge to) attribute some deﬁnite pre-measurement energy to
the particle. It seems, instead, more reasonable to summarize the situation by say-
ing that the PIB doesn’t really have any particular energy prior to the measurement,
although it does have one after the measurement.
Here is another example of how, in the pilot-wave theory, measurements do not
necessarily just passively reveal pre-existing values. We mentioned at the beginning
of this chapter that, for an electron in the ground state of Hydrogen or a particle-in-
a-box potential, the (literal, pointlike) particle will be motionless. The same will be
true for an electron in the ground state of a simple harmonic oscillator potential; let
us analyze this case in some detail using some bits of mathematics that have already
been worked out for other purposes.
Thus, consider an electron moving in one dimension which experiences the poten-
tial energy
V (x) = 1
2mω2x2.
(7.45)

7.5 Contextuality

The lowest-energy solution of the time-independent Schrödinger equation is a
Gaussian wave function
ψ(x) = Ne−x2/4σ2
(7.46)
where the width σ of the wave packet is related to the (classical angular) frequency
ω of the oscillator and the mass m of the particle through
σ2 =
ℏ
2mω .
(7.47)
The energy eigenvalue of this state is E = 1
2ℏω.
If the electron is in this ground state, its wave function will be
ψ(x, t) = Ne−x2/4σ2e−i Et/ℏ.
(7.48)
The complex phase S(x, t) depends on t only and so, like the earlier examples,
Eq.(7.4) implies that the velocity of the (literal, pointlike) particle is zero, regardless
of its precise location X within the Gaussian wave packet.
And this of course means that the momentum of the particle is zero as well,
assuming that by “the momentum of the particle” we just mean its mass multiplied
by its instantaneous velocity: p = m d X
dt . But this should be slightly troubling since,
as discussed in Chap.2, the generalized Born rule implies that a measurement of the
momentum of the electron in this situation is exceedingly unlikely to yield the value
p = 0. Recall in particular that the Gaussian wave function ψ(x) = Ne−x2/4σ2 can
be written as a linear combination of momentum eigenstates ψ(x) =

φ(k) eikx
√
2πdk
with
φ(k) =
√
2Nσ e−k2σ2.
(7.49)
This,accordingtothegeneralizedBornrule,impliesthattheprobabilityforamomen-
tum measurement to yield a value between p and p + dp is
P(p) dp = P(k) dk
= |φ(k)|2dk
= 2N 2σ2 e−2k2σ2 dk
= 2N 2σ2
ℏ
e−2p2σ2/ℏ2 dp
(7.50)
where we have used p = ℏk to relate the wave number k to the momentum p.
It is thus clear that, if the pilot-wave theory is going to be able to reproduce the
usual quantum statistical predictions, it cannot be that momentum measurements
simply reveal the pre-existing momentum! And, of course, it turns out that they do
not. To understand in detail what the theory does say, about how such measurements
will come out, we just need to analyze the measurement procedure in detail, using
the theory.

196

The Pilot-Wave Theory
This particular example lends itself well to imagining a so-called “time-of-ﬂight”
procedure for measuring the momentum. The idea here is that, to determine the
momentum of the electron, one could “turn off” the potential energy V (x) which
conﬁnes the electron to the vicinity of the origin, let the particle ﬂy freely away from
the origin for a long time, observe its position, and then infer what the momentum
must have been to allow it to arrive at that position.
We have already worked through all of the mathematics required to analyze this
type of momentum measurement. For example, we saw in Sect.7.3 that, for a free
particle whose wave function is, at t = 0, ψ(x, 0) = N e−x2/4σ2, the particle trajecto-
ries are given by Eq.(7.30). Since our momentum measurement procedure involves
letting the particles ﬂy freely for a very long time, it is sufﬁcient to take the large t
limit in which
X(t) ≈X0
ℏt
2mσ2 .
(7.51)
If the particle is observed at X(t) at time t, we will infer that its velocity has been
v = X(t)/t. Thus, according to the pilot-wave theory, a particle whose initial (t = 0)
position was X0 will produce a measured momentum value
p = mv = X0ℏ
2σ2 .
(7.52)
Qualitatively, one sees how this particular method of measuring the momentum of the
electron yields non-zero values even though the electron’s momentum was, just prior
to the initiation of the measurement procedure, zero: turning off the conﬁning poten-
tial energy changes the subsequent time-evolution of the electron’s wave function,
which in turn causes the particle to acquire a non-zero momentum! (Or, at least, this
is what happens if, as is overwhelmingly probable, the particle’s initial position does
not happen to be precisely X0 = 0.) The outcome of the measurement does indeed
in some sense come into existence as a result of the measurement intervention. But
the process by which this occurs is clear and comprehensible and governed by the
same quantum laws that (according to the pilot-wave theory) always apply.
It is easy to check also that the quantitative statistics work out correctly. Using
Eq.(7.52) to relate the measured momentum value p to the initial position X0 of the
particle within the wave packet, we may assert that the probability for the momentum
measurement to yield a value between p and p + dp is equal to the probability that
the initial position of the particle was in the range that would lead to those outcomes.
But then we know how to express that probability in terms of the initial wave function.
Putting these pieces together, we ﬁnd that
P(p) dp = P(X0) d X0
= |ψ(X0, 0)|2 d X0
= N 2 e−X2
0/2σ2 d X0
= 2N 2σ2

e−2p2σ2/ℏ2 dp.
(7.53)

197
This is precisely the same Gaussian distribution of p-values that we found, in
Eq.(7.50), was predicted by the generalized Born rule of ordinary quantum mechan-
ics. So the pilot-wave theory not only explains qualitatively how a particle whose
pre-measurement momentum is zero can nevertheless be measured to have a non-
zero momentum, but it precisely agrees with ordinary quantum mechanics about the
precise statistical distribution of those measured values.
This example nicely illustrates the point that, for measurable quantities other than
position, measurements according to the pilot-wave theory do not just passively real
the pre-existing value of the quantity in question. This is part of what is meant by
saying that, for the pilot-wave theory, properties like momentum (and energy and
spin) are “contextual”.
But this notion of “contextuality” goes a little bit deeper. It is not just that the
result of a measurement of a certain property can in general be different from the pre-
measurement value of that property. Rather, there may be no such meaningful thing
as “the pre-measurement value of that property” at all! We have already suggested
something along these lines in the case of the measurement of the energy of the PIB
(whose wave function is initially a superposition of several energy eigenstates). A
complete description of the pre-measurement state of the PIB consists, according to
the pilot-wave theory, of the PIB wave function (a superposition of several energy
eigenstates) and the position X of the associated particle. It is simply not clear how,
from these ingredients, one would construct some speciﬁc energy value to attribute
to the PIB as a “pre-measurement value”.
But, you might object, the pilot-wave theory is deterministic! So surely the
outcome of the energy measurement (i.e., the ﬁnal position Y(t) of the energy-
measuring-apparatus pointer) is determined by, i.e., is some complicated function
of, the initial states of the PIB and the pointer and the details (captured by the inter-
action Hamiltonian Hint) of their interaction. That is true, but does not affect the
overall point. The heart of the matter is that the measurement outcome depends not
only on the initial state of the measured system (and the initial state of the measur-
ing apparatus) but also on details pertaining to the speciﬁc way the measurement is
carried out.
Concretely, in our example of the measurement of the energy of the PIB, the out-
come of the measurement will depend not only on the initial conditions – (x, y, 0),
X(0), and Y(0) – but also on the value of λ, which controls the “strength” of the
PIB-Pointer interaction and so determines, for example, the amount of time it takes
for the conﬁguration space “islands” described around Fig.7.5 to separate. From a
purely dynamical point of view, it is hardly surprising that the conﬁguration point
{X(t), Y(t)}, which after all moves in some complicated and erratic way while the
“islands” are still in the process of separating, can end up in a different “island”
depending on the amount of time it takes for them to separate. But this means that
different – and perfectly, equally legitimate – methods of “measuring the energy of
the PIB” will yield different measurement outcomes, even if they are implemented on
perfectly identical systems. Surely this demonstrates the complete pointlessness of
trying to imagine that there is, according to the pilot-wave theory, some pre-existing

The Pilot-Wave Theory
energy value which is revealed by (or even somehow affected by and then revealed
by) the measurement procedure.
Bell has pointed out that any residual feeling of queasiness – about the fact that
“measurements” do not, in general, merely reveal some pre-existing value for the
quantity being measured – is almost certainly just a result of the connotations of the
word “measurement”. If, to you, the word “measurement” means “simply ﬁnding
out something that was already deﬁnite” then it turns out that, according to the pilot-
wave theory, (the procedures that are conventionally called) “position measurements”
are indeed genuine measurements, whereas (the procedures that are conventionally
called) “energy measurements” (and “momentum measurements” and “spin mea-
surements”...) are not actually measurements at all. Perhaps, as Bell suggested, using
a different word (like “experiment” instead of “measurement”) would help us avoid
inappropriate expectations. But there is nothing here that is actually problematic:
the word [‘measurement’] comes loaded with meaning from everyday life, meaning which is
entirely inappropriate in the quantum context. When it is said that something is ‘measured’
it is difﬁcult not to think of the result as referring to some pre-existing property of the
object in question. [But t]his is to disregard Bohr’s insistence that in quantum phenomena
the apparatus as well as the system is essentially involved. If it were not so, how could we
understand, for example, that measurement of a component of ‘angular momentum’ – in an
arbitrarily chosen direction – yields one of a discrete set of values? When one forgets the
role of the apparatus, as the word measurement makes all too likely, one despairs of ordinary
logic – hence ‘quantum logic’. When one remembers the role of the apparatus, ordinary
logic is just ﬁne [6].
For our purposes, all of this is important because it allows us to understand how,
exactly, it is possible for the pilot-wave theory to exist, and work, in the face of the
“no hidden variables” theorems that were mentioned back in Chap.3. It seems that the
(largely unacknowledged) linguistic connotations of the word “measurement” have
contributed signiﬁcantly to generations of physicists abandoning the hidden variables
program and succumbing to the Copenhagen philosophy (or entertaining even more
radical proposals such as the abandoning of the laws of logic). In particular, the
conventional use of the word “measurement” (to describe experiments which output
a value for the position, momentum, energy, spin, etc., of a particle) has led people
to believe that it is reasonable to insist that any “hidden variable” account of such
processes would have to attribute deﬁnite pre-measurement values that are simply
revealed by the measurement, for all such quantities. But the “no hidden variables”
theorems prove that “hidden variable” theories of that sort are impossible.
The “no hidden variables” theorems, that is, invariably apply only to “non-
contextual” hidden variables theories. That is why those theorems do not in an any
sense rule out the pilot-wave theory. But more importantly, the pilot-wave theory
shows rather clearly that “contextuality” is in no way contrived or problematic, but
is instead a completely straightforward consequence of the theory’s very natural
dynamical postulates. One just needs to take seriously the idea (which is inherent in
understanding the measurement problem as a problem) that what a theory says about
“measurements” should be extracted from (rather than awkwardly appended to) the
theory’s fundamental dynamical postulates.

7.6 The Many-Particle Theory and Nonlocality

7.6
The Many-Particle Theory and Nonlocality
In the opening of a paper he wrote in 1982, Bell describes his own ﬁrst-person
perspective on the “no hidden variables” theorem of von Neumann and its relation
to the pilot-wave theory:
When I was a student I had much difﬁculty with quantum mechanics. It was comforting
to ﬁnd that even Einstein had such difﬁculties for a long time. Indeed they had led him
to the heretical conclusion that something was missing in the theory: ‘I am, in fact, ﬁrmly
convinced that the essentially statistical character of contemporary quantum theory is solely
to be ascribed to the fact that this (theory) operates with an incomplete description of physical
systems.’
More explicitly, in ‘a complete physical description, the statistical quantum theory would ...
take an approximately analogous position to the statistical mechanics within the framework
of classical mechanics...’.
Einstein did not seem to know that this possibility, of peaceful coexistence between quantum
statistical predictions and a more complete theoretical description, had been disposed of
with great rigour by J. von Neumann. I myself did not know von Neumann’s demonstration
at ﬁrst hand, for at that time it was available only in German, which I could not read.
However I knew of it from the beautiful book by Born, Natural Philosophy of Cause and
Chance, which was in fact one of the highlights of my physics education. Discussing how
physics might develop Born wrote: ‘I expect ... that we shall have to sacriﬁce some current
ideas and to use still more abstract methods. However these are only opinions. A more
concrete contribution to this question has been made by J.v. Neumann in his brilliant book,
Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik. He puts the theory on an axiomatic
basis by deriving it from a few postulates of a very plausible and general character, about
the properties of ‘expectation values’ (averages) and their representation by mathematical
symbols. The result is that the formalism of quantum mechanics is uniquely determined
by these axioms; in particular, no concealed parameters can be introduced with the help of
which the indeterministic description could be transformed into a deterministic one. Hence
if a future theory should be deterministic, it cannot be a modiﬁcation of the present one but
must be essentially different. How this could be possible without sacriﬁcing a whole treasure
of well established results I leave to the determinists to worry about.’
Having read this, I relegated the question to the back of my mind and got on with more
practical things.
But in 1952 I saw the impossible done. It was in papers by David Bohm. Bohm showed
explicitly how parameters could indeed be introduced, into nonrelativistic wave mechanics,
with the help of which the indeterministic description could be transformed into a deter-
ministic one. More importantly, in my opinion, the subjectivity of the orthodox version, the
necessary reference to the ‘observer’, could be eliminated.
Moreover, the essential idea was one that had been advanced already by de Broglie in 1927,
in his ‘pilot wave’ picture.
But why then had Born not told me of this ‘pilot wave’? If only to point out what was wrong
with it? Why did von Neumann not consider it? More extraordinarily, why did people go
on producing ‘impossibility’ proofs, after 1952, and as recently as 1978? When even Pauli,
Rosenfeld, and Heisenberg, could produce no more devastating criticism of Bohm’s version
than to brand it as ‘metaphysical’ and ‘ideological’? Why is the pilot wave picture ignored in
text books? Should it not be taught, not as the only way, but as an antidote to the prevailing
complacency? To show that vagueness, subjectivity, and indeterminism, are not forced on
us by experimental facts, but by deliberate theoretical choice? [7]

200
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
These are all very interesting and good questions that deserve answers. But we will
not try to answer them here. I just wanted to give you a reference point for what
you should probably be thinking at this point in the chapter: if this pilot-wave theory
is as wonderful as it seems, why haven’t I heard of it before? The theory seems to
completely eliminate the “measurement problem” and, although the (puzzling) wave
function of the universe still plays a role in the theory, there is no serious “ontology
problem” since the everyday world of material objects is not supposed to be made
of the wave function but is instead composed of the particles – whose existence in
three-dimensional physical space is obviously unproblematic.
Overall, the reaction to the theory – by people like Pauli, Rosenfeld, and Heisen-
berg – is indeed puzzling. There is some kind of deep philosophical bias against what
seems on the surface to be a far more scientiﬁc approach than the openly philosoph-
ical Copenhagen interpretation. But there is one feature of the pilot-wave theory, a
technical physics feature, not at all “philosophical”, which explains at least some of
the physics community’s near-unanimous dismissal of the theory: it not only fails
to solve “the locality problem” that we discussed extensively in Chap.4, but indeed
makes the non-locality (which, at least according to Einstein, already afﬂicted ordi-
nary QM) more blatant, explicit, and problematic.
The pilot-wave theory is manifestly non-local in the following sense: the velocity
of each particle, at a given instant, depends on the instantaneous positions of all other
particles (at least when there is entanglement). For example, consider a two-particle
system with wave function (x1, x2, t). The velocity of particle 1 at time t is given
by
v1(t) = d X1(t)
dt
= ℏ
m1
Im

⎣

∂(x1,X2(t),t)
∂x1

(x1, X2(t), t)
⎤
⎦

x1=X1(t)
.
(7.54)
The point is that the right hand side depends on X2(t), the position of the other particle
– even though this could be a million miles away. How particle 1 moves will depend,
according to the theory, on what’s happening with particle 2, and the dependence
is immediate (with nothing like a speed-of-light time delay) and independent of the
distance between the particles.
To make the non-locality even more explicit and dramatic, let’s consider a situation
in which “what’s happening with particle 2” can be inﬂuenced in some way, say by
some human agent who decides whether to make a certain kind of measurement
on particle 2. As we have seen, such an intervention will inﬂuence the evolution of
the wave function and hence affect the subsequent trajectories of the particles. The
dramatic and shocking thing is that the subsequent trajectory of particle 1 can be
affected by an experimental intervention that is localized in the vicinity of particle 2.
So, consider in particular two “particle-in-a-box” sub-systems that are well-
separated in space (so the origins of the x1 and x2 coordinate systems are far apart
from each other) in the entangled state:
(x1, x2, t) =

Remember, though, that x1 = 0 is something like a million miles to the left and
x2 = 0 is a million miles to the right.
The wave function  in Eq.(7.55) is an energy eigenstate of the two-PIB system,
but turns out to have nonzero probability currents jx1 and jx2 (because of the relative
phase between the two terms). That is, it turns out that the two particles, according
to the pilot-wave theory, move – and move in tandem – as long as their joint wave
function remains in this state. A density plot of ||2 is shown in Fig.7.6, and some
plots of the associated motion of the two particles are shown in Fig.7.7.
As long as the two-PIB system remains, undisturbed, in the quantum state
Eq.(7.55), the two particles each just continue oscillating back and forth in their
respective boxes. But now suppose that somebody decides to measure (say) the
energy of particle 2. In the pilot-wave theory, we can analyze this measurement in
the same schematic way we’ve done before: consider an energy measuring device
with a moveable pointer whose ﬁnal position will indicate the outcome of the energy
measurement. We can suppose that the wave function of the pointer begins in a
“ready” state φ(y) that is a Gaussian packet centered on y = 0. (The actual pointer

If and when the measurement is actually carried out, an interaction Hamiltonian such
as

Prior to the measurement interaction, the initial wave function – Eq.(7.57) – has
support only around y = 0 and then looks, in the x1-x2-plane, like what we talked
about before: it is a superposition of the “particle 1in the ground state and particle
2in the ﬁrst excited state” and “particle 1in the ﬁrst excited state and particle 2in the
ground state” states which has a node ( = 0) at (x1, x2) = (L/2, L/2) and a “ring”
of large ||2 around the node. As the measurement interaction proceeds, though, the
two superposed PIB states get “lifted” – by different amounts! – in the y-direction
in conﬁguration space and so cease to overlap. This is pictured in Fig.7.8.
The actual conﬁguration point {X1, X2, Y} of course ends up randomly (depend-
ing on the detailed initial particle positions) in one or the other of the two now-
separated “islands” of wave function support in conﬁguration space. In particular, as
we discussed before, the pointer ends up with some deﬁnite position, either Y ≈λE1t
(indicating “particle 2 has energy E1”) or Y ≈λE2t (indicating “particle 2 has
energy E2”). But then consider the implications of this for the subsequent motion of
particle 1.

Fig. 7.8 The wave function (x1, x2, y) for the example discussed in the text, in which the energy
of one of two entangled particles-in-boxes is measured and the outcome displayed in a pointer
with coordinate y. Prior to the measurement, the two superposed terms overlap, in the y = 0 plane,
giving rise to the wave function with the structure depicted earlier, in Fig.7.6. But the coupling to
the measuring device’s pointer causes the two terms to separate as shown here: the ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2)
term (“particle 1 is in the ground state and particle 2 is in the ﬁrst excited state”) is displaced in the
y-direction by a distance λE2t, while the ψ2(x1)ψ1(x2) term (“particle 1 is in the ﬁrst excited state
and particle 2 is in the ground state”) is displaced in the y-direction by a smaller distance, λE1t. In
the pilot-wave theory, the actual conﬁguration point {X1, X2, Y} will end up in one or the other of
these “islands” in conﬁguration space, depending on the initial positions of the three particles. But
then since the particle velocities depend only on the structure of the wave function near the actual
conﬁguration point, the subsequent evolution of all three particles will be dictated exclusively by
just one of the two terms in the wave function. And this implies (among other things) that after the
measurement on particle 2, particle 1 will stop moving
There are two equivalent ways to put the point.
First, since the velocity of particle 1 depends only on the structure of  around
the actual conﬁguration point, the relevant part of  is now either ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2) (if
Y ≈λE2t) or ψ2(x1)ψ1(x2) (if Y ≈λE1t). It is one term or the other, rather than
their superposition, which will now determine the subsequent motion of particle 1.
But for both possibilities it turns out that the velocity of particle 1 will be zero!
The second way to express the same point is to say that while, prior to the mea-
surement of particle 2’s energy, the “conditional wave function” (CWF) of particle
1 is a superposition of the ground state and ﬁrst excited state wave functions (which
gives rise to the oscillatory motion we saw at the beginning of this chapter), after the
measurement of particle 2’s energy, the CWF of particle 1 “collapses” to either the

204
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
ground state or the ﬁrst excited state. And, as we talked about before, both of these
possibilities imply that particle 1 will be at rest.
However you think about it, though, the crucial point is that, by measuring the
energy of (i.e., by intervening in the affairs of) particle 2 (which remember is, say,
a million miles to the right!), we have caused a sudden and dramatic change in
the behavior of particle 1 (which, remember, is a million miles to the left): it went
from oscillating back and forth, to just sitting there at rest. We made it stop moving,
instantaneously, from two million miles away! It is a truly blatant case of “spooky
action at a distance” which seems impossible to reconcile with the relativistic concept
of locality according to which all causal inﬂuences propagate at or below the speed
of light.
It is, however, worth noting that, although there is a blatant violation of relativistic
localityhere,theinstantaneousaction-at-a-distancecannotbeusedtotransmitsignals
or information. This is implied by the fact that the pilot-wave theory makes the same
statistical predictions as ordinary QM, but it is worth saying a little more here. One
has to remember that, although, according to the pilot-wave theory, particle 1 is
initially oscillating back and forth, one cannot observe this motion (or its subsequent
cessation). Or rather, if you did try to observe it, this observation would require
interacting with particle 1 with some physical observation equipment, which would
disrupt its subsequent evolution and “break” the entanglement with particle 2 (just
like the energy measurement in the above example does), and hence imply that a
later measurement on particle 2 has no effect whatsoever on particle 1!
Or one can think of it this way: although particle 1 has, at every moment, a deﬁnite
position X1(t), that position is not known to anybody; all that is known is a probability
distribution for where particle 1 might be found if looked for. But this probability
distribution, as it turns out, is independent of time and in particular doesn’t change
even when the distant intervention (which causes particle 1 to stop moving) occurs.
You could imagine, for example, setting up thousands of copies of this system (with
identical wave functions but of course random and different particle positions), with
Alice stationed a million miles to the left with all the particle 1s, and Bob stationed a
million miles to the right with all the particle 2s and an arsenal of energy-measuring
devices. Suppose, by prior arrangement, Bob will pick some random time within a
few seconds of t = 0 to measure the energies of all of his particle 2s. What could
Alice do to monitor her particles and try to observe the effect of Bob’s intervention
on them?
She could, for example, pick a few hundred of the particles and measure their
positions at t = 0, then do the same thing at t = 1s for a different set of a few hundred
particles,thendothesamethingagainatt = 2s,andsoon.Andthepointis,shewould
never be able to tell in this way when Bob had performed the intervention which, in
fact, according to the theory, inﬂuences the motion of her collection of particles. She
would just see the same exact random distribution in the sets of particles inspected
before Bob’s intervention, as she sees in the sets inspected after Bob’s intervention.
Similarly, if Alice instead measures the energies of a few hundred of her particles,
she will get the same statistical distribution of outcomes (namely: about half E1 and
about half E2) whether Bob has made his measurements yet, or not. Each individual

7.6 The Many-Particle Theory and Nonlocality
205
one of Bob’s measurements affects the motion of one of Alice’s particles, according
to the pilot-wave theory, and indeed the outcome of Bob’s measurement allows him
to know, in advance and with absolute certainty, how a subsequent measurement, by
Alice, of the energy of the entangled partner, will come out. But because Bob cannot
control the outcome of his own experiment, the non-local causal inﬂuence which
produces the perfect correlation, is useless for purposes of communication.
So although, according to the theory, there are these blatant violations of rela-
tivistic causality, they are in some sense “behind the scenes” – hidden away where
we can’t in practice see them or use them to (say) send signals faster than light.
This, in some sense, saves the theory from the worst kind of conﬂict with relativity:
it would be bad, for example, if the theory implied that you could relay a message
into your own past and arrange, say, to have your parents killed before you were
born. (That is a classic example of the kind of paradoxical situation that could arise
if faster-than-light signalling – which remember implies signalling into the past in
some reference frames if relativity is true – were possible.) But this is not much
comfort for anybody who takes relativity theory seriously, as telling us something
about the fundamental structure of space and time, rather than just prohibiting cer-
tain types of communication among humans. If relativity theory is taken to prohibit
faster-than-light causal inﬂuences, then the pilot-wave theory is just inconsistent with
relativity, end of discussion.

Reactions
As mentioned before, the basic idea of the pilot-wave theory (that is, the idea of
resolving the wave-particle duality dilemma by having both waves and particles)
was proposed already in the 1920s by de Broglie. When he presented his ideas, they
were roundly rejected by nearly everyone and de Broglie himself abandoned the idea
shortly thereafter. It was basically only Einstein who had a favorable reaction to de
Broglie’s ideas: recall his (Einstein’s) comment from 1927 that
one can remove [the “boxes” type objection, against nonlocality] only in the following way,
that one does not describe the process solely by the Schrödinger wave, but that at the same
time one localises the particle during the propagation. I think Mr de Broglie is right to search
in this direction [8].
Twenty ﬁve years later – during which time de Broglie had completely abandoned
and forgotten the pilot-wave idea, and Einstein had gone off on his own to try to
develophis “uniﬁedﬁeldtheory”program–DavidBohmindependentlyrediscovered
and developed and published the pilot-wave idea. Prior to this publication, Bohm
wrote: “I can’t believe that I should have been the one to see this” and expressed
an optimistic expectation “that the physics community would react with enthusiasm
[9].” But instead the community reacted very negatively. Oppenheimer dismissed
Bohm’s ideas as “juvenile deviationism” and said that “if we cannot disprove Bohm,
then we must agree to ignore him.” Rosenfeld called the theory “very ingenious, but

206
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
basically wrong”. Wolfgang Pauli called it “foolish simplicity” which “is of course
beyond all help [9, 10]”.
None of this is particularly surprising, in the sense that all of these people were
(by then) proponents of the (by then) orthodox Copenhagen interpretation which (as
we have seen) is quite antagonistic toward the very idea of trying to give a precise
and realistic description of microscopic processes. It is somewhat more puzzling,
then, that even Einstein – the greatest critic of the Copenhagen interpretation and
the greatest champion of the pilot-wave idea back in the 1920s – did not seem to
think highly of the theory, even though it seems to be exactly the kind of thing that
Einstein had sought and even though Einstein had directly and personally inﬂuenced
and encouraged Bohm into the line of thinking that led to his (re-) discovery of the
pilot-wave ideas [10]. Einstein wrote, in a letter to Max Born:
Have you noticed that Bohm believes (as de Broglie did, 25 years ago) that he is able to
interpret the quantum theory in deterministic terms? That way seems too cheap to me [11].
It is not clear exactly what Einstein meant by “too cheap”, but it seems likely that the
theory did not strike him as a step in the right direction since it failed to eliminate
(but instead in some ways exacerbated) the one feature that Einstein found most
unacceptable in orthodox quantum theory: non-locality.
Heisenberg (less surprisingly) also didn’t much like the pilot-wave theory, and
gave his reasons in some detail in an essay called “Criticisms and Counterproposals
to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Theory”:
When one analyzes the papers of the ﬁrst group [of criticisms/counterproposals, namely,
those who do not “want to change the Copenhagen interpretation so far as predictions of
experimental results are concerned”, but try “to change the language of this interpretation
in order to get a closer resemblance to classical physics”] it is important to realize from the
beginning that their interpretations cannot be refuted by experiment, since they only repeat
the Copenhagen interpretation in a different language. From a strictly positivistic standpoint
one may even say that we are here concerned not with counterproposals to the Copenhagen
interpretation but with its exact repetition in a different language. Therefore, one can only
dispute the suitability of this language. One group of counterproposals works with the idea
of ‘hidden parameters’. Since the quantum-theoretical laws determine in general the results
of an experiment only statistically, one would from the classical standpoint be inclined to
think that there exist some hidden parameters which escape observation in any ordinary
experiment but which determine the outcome of the experiment in the normal causal way.
Therefore, some papers try to construct such parameters within the framework of quantum
mechanics.
Along this line, for instance, Bohm has made a counter-proposal to the Copenhagen inter-
pretation, which has recently been taken up to some extent also by de Broglie. Bohm’s
interpretation has been worked out in detail. It may therefore serve here as a basis for the
discussions. Bohm considers the particles as ‘objectively real’ structures, like the point
masses in Newtonian mechanics. The waves in conﬁguration space are in his interpretation
‘objectively real’ too, like electric ﬁelds. Conﬁguration space is a space of many dimensions
referring to the different co-ordinates of all the particles belonging to the system. Here we
meet a ﬁrst difﬁculty: what does it mean to call waves in conﬁguration space ‘real’? This
space is a very abstract space.... but things are in the ordinary three-dimensional space, not
in an abstract conﬁguration space. One may call the waves in conﬁguration space ‘objective’
when one wants to say that these waves do not depend on any observer; but one can scarcely
call them ‘real’ unless one is willing to change the meaning of the word.

7.7 Reactions
207
....One consequence of this interpretation is, as Pauli has emphasized, that the electrons in
the ground states of many atoms should be at rest, not performing any orbital motion around
the atomic nucleus..... [Bohm responds that] when the quantum theory for the measuring
equipment is taken into account – especially some strange quantum potentials introduced
ad hoc by Bohm – then the statement is admissible that the electrons ‘really’ always are at
rest. In measurements of the position of the particle, Bohm takes the ordinary interpretation
of the experiments as correct; in measurements of the velocity he rejects it. At this price
Bohm considers himself able to assert: ‘We do not need to abandon the precise, rational and
objective description of individual systems in the realm of quantum theory.’ This objective
description, however, reveals itself as a kind of ‘ideological superstructure’, which has little
to do with immediate physical reality....
....Bohm’s language, as we have already pointed out, says nothing about physics that is
different from what the Copenhagen interpretation says [12].
Readers of Chap.5 will sympathize with Heisenberg’s point that the wave function
on conﬁguration space is hard to take seriously as a physically real ﬁeld (even if the
pilot-wave theory arguably suffers less from an “ontology problem” than theories
for which the wave function is supposed to be the only physical reality). And those
who followed the discussion in Sect.7.5 will recognize Heisenberg’s complaint about
electronsinatomsbeing(hethinks,implausibly)atrestaswellashiscomplaint(albeit
using different terminology) that position, for Bohm, is non-contextual while velocity
is contextual. Beneath all of this, though, is the more controversial philosophical
question about what it means for a theory to “say something about physics”.
In general, then, it is fair to say that the pilot-wave theory never got a particularly
favorable reception, either when it was proposed initially in 1927 by de Broglie
or when it was proposed later in 1952 by Bohm. And it continues to be regarded,
by most physicists, as (at best) not worthy of serious attention. But – as we’ve
seen – it was viewed very positively by Bell, who recognized it immediately as an
explicit counter-example to the supposed proofs (by von Neumann and others) that no
“hidden variable” completion of quantum mechanics was mathematically possible.
This realization led Bell to wonder how the “impossibility proofs” had gone wrong,
exactly – how they had wrongly convinced so many people that something which
clearly is possible, isn’t possible. Bell answered this question (in effect, by explicitly
identifying the tacit assumption of “non-contextuality” in the proofs) in an important
1964 paper which (due to an unfortunate editorial accident) remained unpublished
until 1966 [12].
Attheendofthatpaper,heexplainsthat,whileBohm’spilot-wavetheoryisaclear-
cut counter-example to any assertion that deterministic hidden variable theories are
impossible, the theory does have the unappealing feature we noted in the last section
– what Bell refers to as a “grossly nonlocal character”:
in this theory an explicit causal mechanism exists whereby the disposition of one piece of
apparatus affects the results obtained with a distant piece. In fact the Einstein–Podolsky–
Rosen paradox is resolved in the way which Einstein would have liked least [13].
Bell then ends the paper with the following paragraph:
Bohm of course was well aware of these features of his scheme, and has given them much
attention. However, it must be stressed that, to the present writer’s knowledge, there is no

208

The Pilot-Wave Theory
proof that any hidden variable account of quantum mechanics must have this extraordinary
character.[∗] It would therefore be interesting, perhaps, to pursue some further ‘impossibility
proofs’, replacing the arbitrary axioms objected to above [namely, “non-contextuality”] by
some condition of locality, or of separability of distant systems [13].
The “[∗]” points to a footnote which was added before the delayed publication of the
paper: “Since the completion of this paper such a proof has been found: J.S. Bell,
Physics 1, 195, [1964]”. That is, between the completion of this ﬁrst paper in 1964,
and its publication in 1966, Bell had already discovered and published the answer
to his own question: would it be possible to construct a hidden variable completion
of QM, with all of the virtues of the pilot-wave theory, but without the troubling
non-local character?
His answer is the subject of Chap.8.

7.11 Calculate jx1 and jx2 for the wave function in Eq.(7.55).
7.12 In the passage quoted in Sect.7.7, Heisenberg refers to “some strange quantum
potentials introduced ad hoc by Bohm”. This is a reference to a slightly dif-
ferent formulation of the pilot-wave theory, in terms of which Bohm presents
the theory in his 1952 papers. To see how this works, take a time derivative
of Eq.(7.6) to derive an expression for the acceleration of the particle. It is
important here that the right hand side of Eq.(7.6) depends on time in two
different ways, so one must use the “convective derivative” d
dt = ∂
∂t + dx
dt
∂
∂x .
If all goes well you should be able to write the equation describing the motion
of the particle in the somewhat more Newtonian-mechanical-like form,
ma = −∂
∂x (V + Q)
(7.68)
where V is the regular (“classical”) potential energy function (which appears
in Schrödinger’s equation) and then Q is a new, so-called “quantum potential”
which depends on the structure of the wave function ψ. Find the expression
for Q. (It can be expressed most simply in terms of the R in ψ = ReiS.) Think
about how to understand, from this more classical perspective on the motion of
the particle, how (for example) the electron particle in a ground-state Hydrogen
atom remains at rest.
7.13 The previous Project might suggest that, in addition to the kinetic energy
K = 1
2mv2 and classical potential energy V (x), a particle in the pilot-wave
theory also possesses some “quantum potential energy”, Q. Would the inclu-
sion of this “quantum potential energy” make it possible to regard the mea-
surement of the energy of a particle as revealing a pre-existing energy value?
In other words, does the possibility of re-formulating the theory in this more
Newtonian-mechanical-like way undermine our conclusion that energy is, in
the pilot-wave theory, contextual?
7.14 Suppose we deﬁne the total energy of a particle in the pilot-wave theory as
E = K + V + Q as suggested in the previous Project. Is the total energy E
of a particle conserved according to the theory?
7.15 One of Heisenberg’s criticisms of Bohm’s theory is that “[i]n measurements of
the position of the particle, Bohm takes the ordinary interpretation of the exper-
iments as correct; in measurements of the velocity he rejects it.” Heisenberg
here means that, in the pilot-wave picture, position is non-contextual whereas
velocity is contextual. Heisenberg seems to think that this is the result of a
choice and is therefore arbitrary and unbelievable. But we have shown in the
Chapter that the contextuality of (for example) momentum and energy is not
a choice at all, but simply a consequence of the basic dynamical postulates of
the theory. Complete the rebuttal of Heisenberg’s criticism by showing that
position measurements just do, according again to the dynamical postulates,

reveal pre-existing position values. (Hint: consider a particle with wave func-
tion ψ0(x) whose position is to be measured using an apparatus whose pointer
has an initial wave function φ(y) and interacts with the particle according to
ˆHint = λˆx ˆpy. Show that the x- and y-components of the quantum probabil-
ity current can be taken to be jx = 0 and jy = λx∗ so that d X/dt = 0
and dY/dt = λX. This implies that the ﬁnal displacement of the pointer is
proportional to X, the actual position of the particle whose position is being
measured.)
7.16 Read through Bohm’s 1952 papers [3] and report on anything you ﬁnd inter-
esting or surprising.
7.17 Read through Ref. [14], “The pilot-wave perspective on quantum scattering
and tunneling,” and summarize its main points.
7.18 Read through Ref. [15], “The pilot-wave perspective on spin,” and summa-
rize its main points. In particular, explain in detail how the pilot-wave theory
accounts for the EPR-Bohm correlations. Bell says that the theory resolves
the EPR paradox “in the way which Einstein would have liked least”. What
exactly does he mean?
7.19 Can the pilot-wave theory be diagnosed as “nonlocal” using Bell’s formulation
of locality (or the slightly modiﬁed formulation) from Chap.1? How about
using the related necessary condition for locality that we developed in Chap.5?
7.20 In the text, the non-locality of the pilot-wave theory is explained in terms of
an entangled two-particle state (with a measurement of one of the particles
non-locally affecting the motion of the other, distant particle). But we saw
in Chap.4 that textbook quantum theory is already apparently non-local in
the simpler, single-particle “Einstein’s boxes” scenario. Is any non-locality
involved in the pilot-wave theory’s account of “Einstein’s boxes”? Explain.
7.21 Recall the passage quoted in Sect.6.6, in which (the textbook author) David
Grifﬁths explains three frequently-encountered attitudes toward quantum
mechanics: the “realist” position, the “orthodox” position, and the “agnos-
tic” position. Would Grifﬁths classify the pilot-wave theory as “realist”? Note
that your answer will depend on whether or not you think he intends what
he says about a position measurement, by way of deﬁning what he means by
“realist”, to apply just to position measurements, or instead to apply more
generally to measurements of any property. Why do you think Grifﬁths isn’t
more explicit about this issue, namely, whether, to count as “realist”, a the-
ory should merely say that position measurements reveal pre-existing position
values, or instead must say that a measurement of any quantity must reveal its
pre-existing value?
7.22 In the passage quoted in Sect.6.6, Grifﬁths seems to deﬁne “realism” as mean-
ing that a theory posits speciﬁcally non-contextual hidden variables (at least for
position). The pilot-wave theory would count as “realist” in this sense (if we
interpret this notion of “realism” as requiring non-contextual hidden variables
only for positions... obviously the pilot-wave theory would not be “realist” if
that is taken to require non-contextual hidden variables for not only position,
but also momentum, energy, etc.). But there would seem to be a more basic

212
7
The Pilot-Wave Theory
notion of “realism” that the pilot-wave theory embodies – a notion that doesn’t
pertain to anything so obscure and speciﬁc as non-contextual hidden variables,
but which instead means something along the lines of “there’s a real world out
there, independent of us, and it’s the job of physics theories to describe it.”
Try your hand at describing/formulating this more basic notion of “realism”
(more carefully than I did in the previous sentence). Does the Copenhagen
interpretation count as “realist” in this more basic sense? Would a hidden vari-
able theory according to which all properties are contextual, count as “realist”
in this more basic sense?
7.23 We have argued that the pilot-wave theory completely resolves the measure-
ment problem (of Chap.3), but suffers acutely from the locality problem (of
Chap.4). What about the ontology problem (of Chap.5), about which only a
few brief remarks have been made in passing? Summarize your thinking about
this subtle question.

potential. Explain how these values relate to the values one would naively
expect for a classical particle with the same energy.

Chapter 8
Bell’s Theorem
The result which has come to be known as “Bell’s Theorem” – but which Bell himself
instead referred to as the “locality inequality theorem” [1] – ﬁrst appeared in Bell’s
1964 paper, “On the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox” [2]. Following Bell’s own
presentation, we begin here by recalling (from Chap.4) the EPR argument, in the
updated form introduced by Bohm in 1951.
8.1
EPRB Revisited
In Bohm’s re-formulation, we consider a pair of spatially separated spin 1/2 particles
in the spin “singlet” state
ψs =
1
√
2

ψ1
+zψ2
−z −ψ1
−zψ2
+z

.
(8.1)
With the state written in this form, it is apparent that, from a measurement of the z-
component of particle 1’s spin, we can immediately infer the z-component of particle
2’s spin. The two particles’ z-spins are perfectly anti-correlated: a +1 outcome on
one side implies a −1 outcome on the other side, and vice versa. But according to
the locality assumption, measuring the z-spin of particle 1 (say, nearby) should not
disturb the physical state of the (say, distant) particle 2. And so, according to the
reasoning introduced by EPR in 1935, the distant particle must already possess a
deﬁnite z-spin value (which is then simply revealed when its z-spin is measured). The
only alternative is that the distant particle’s z-spin somehow comes into existence
(crystallizing out of a prior fog, so to speak) as a result of our measurement on
the nearby particle; but that would constitute a violation of local causality. The EPR
claim is that the only way to avoid non-locality is to attribute a pre-determined z-spin
value to the distant particle.

Itisaspecialpropertyofthesingletstatethatittakesexactlythesameform,written
in terms of the states of deﬁnite x-spin, as it does written in terms of the states of
deﬁnite z-spin. This allows the same EPR reasoning to be run again, this time about
x-spin values: the distant particle must also possess a deﬁnite pre-measurement
value for its x-spin since we could determine this value, with certainty, and without
disturbing the physical state of the distant particle, by measuring the x-spin of the
nearby particle.
And note – contra Bohr’s reply to EPR – that the fact that we could only measure
either the nearby particle’s x-spin or its z-spin, does not block the inference to the
pre-determinateness of both properties of the distant particle. It is true that we could
only learn about one or the other of the two properties on a given particle pair. But
the assumption is that we have a genuinely free choice about which property (if
either!) to measure on the nearby particle. If we choose to measure the z-spin of
the nearby particle, we would learn the value of the z-spin of the distant particle
(without disturbing its physical state in any way) and hence be in a position to infer
its existence. Whether we in fact do so choose is immaterial: for the existence of
the distant particle’s z-spin to depend upon whether or not we choose to measure
the nearby particle’s z-spin, would be a violation of locality. So, again, the claim is
that to avoid non-locality (“spooky action-at-a-distance”) we must attribute deﬁnite,
pre-measurement values to both the x- and z-spin of the distant particle.
And, ﬁnally, the argument is symmetric with respect to the two particles: if the dis-
tant particle must already possess deﬁnite values of both x-spin and z-spin (because
we, here, could determine those values indirectly, without in any way inﬂuencing
the physical state of the particle), so must the nearby particle (because someone
over there could determine the values indirectly, without in any way inﬂuencing the
physical state of the nearby particle).
So the upshot of the EPR-Bohm argument is that when a pair of particles is
prepared in the spin state ψs, each particle in the pair must already possess a deﬁnite
value for both x- and z-spin, and these values (for the two particles) must apparently
be correlated to guarantee that any of the possible subsequent measurements agree
with the quantum mechanical statistics. Locality thus requires a “hidden variable”
theory of the sort summarized in the following table:

8.1 EPRB Revisited

25%
3
{−1, +1} {+1, −1}
25%
4
{−1, −1} {+1, +1}
25%
Accordingtothismodel,thedescriptionoftheparticlepairintermsofthequantum
state ψs is decidedly incomplete. There are facts about the x- and z-spins of both
particles that are not contained in ψs! In particular, each pair of particles (prepared in
the quantum state ψs) is in fact of one of the four sub-types described in the four rows
of the table. Which of the four types a given pair of particles ends up is somehow
just random, with equal 25% probabilities for each of the four types.
The exact nature of the four types is described in the “Particle 1” and “Particle
2” columns. For example, {+1, −1} means that the particle in question is spin-up
(“+1”) along the x-direction and spin-down (“−1”) along the z-direction. Notice
that both the x-spin and z-spin values are perfectly anti-correlated within each pair
type. For example, if Particle 1 is spin-up along z, then Particle 2 is spin-down along
z. This ensures that, if the same property (x-spin or z-spin) is measured on both
particles, the results will always be opposite (as predicted by QM). (This also explains
why there are exactly four allowed “pair types”. The other logical possibilities, for
example {+1, +1} for particle 1 and {+1, −1} for particle 2, would violate the perfect
correlation property for at least one possible set of measurements – here, if the x-
spin is measured on both particles. Such pair types, if included, would need to be
assigned frequencies of exactly zero in order for the model to reproduce the quantum
predictions, so we might as well just exclude them entirely from the discussion.)
And notice also that the equal 25% frequencies for all four pair types are required
to match the rest of the quantum predictions. For example, what happens if the x-
spin of particle 1 is measured and the z-spin of particle 2 is measured? The quantum
statistics can be read off from ψs re-written in this form:
ψs = 1

+xψ2
−z + ψ1
−xψ2
−z −ψ1
+xψ2
+z + ψ1
−xψ2


.
(8.4)
The four possible joint outcomes (up-up, down-up, up-down, and down-down)
thus have equal, 25%, probabilities. We can thus reproduce the complete slate of
quantum mechanical statistical predictions (for any set of measurements along the
x- and z-axes) by letting each of the four pair types in our hidden variable model
occur with 25% frequency.
It is clear that this sort of “hidden variable” model, in which particles carry pre-
determined values for possible spin measurements along the x- and z-directions,
can reproduce the quantum predictions but without the non-locality associated with
ordinary quantum theory’s collapse postulate (combined with the claim that the
wave function provides a complete state description). The matter effectively stood
there for several decades, with EPR having shown that such a model is needed

218

Bell’s Theorem
to account for the quantum correlations in a local way, but with most physicists
believing that Bohr had somehow refuted the EPR argument and therefore ignoring
the issue entirely. As we will see, though, Bell moved the issue forward in the 1960s
by asking: could this same local hidden variable model continue to reproduce the
quantum mechanical predictions in a more general setting, where spin measurement
along more and different axes are also allowed?
8.2
A Preliminary Bell Inequality
As we just showed, it is rather straightforward to reproduce the quantum mechanical
predictions, for all possible spin measurements along the x- and z-directions, on a pair
of entangled spin 1/2 particles, with a hidden variable model in which each particle’s
x-spin and z-spin are pre-determined. But let us broaden the discussion. Suppose
that instead of restricting ourselves to measuring the spins of the particles along
the x- and z-directions, we allow spin measurements in arbitrary (not necessarily
orthogonal!) directions; and suppose that instead of considering only two possible
directions (along which to measure the particles’ spins) we allow the experimenter
on each side to choose from among three possible axes. Let’s call the three axes ˆa,
ˆb, and ˆc. Notice that, since the singlet state ψs can be written
ψs =
1
√
2

ψ1
+aψ2
−a −ψ1
−aψ2
+a

(8.5)
– and identically for ˆb and ˆc – it is clear that, according to quantum mechanics,
the outcomes should be perfectly anti-correlated (either “up-down” or “down-up”)
whenever the two experimenters happen to measure their particles’ spins along the
same axis. Agreement with this aspect of the quantum mechanical predictions – and
continuing to insist on locality – again requires a “hidden variable” theory of the sort
we considered before, and requires in particular that the values of (for example) a-
spin (and then identically for b-spin and c-spin) should be perfectly anti-correlated.
A little contemplation reveals that there are now eight types of particle pairs which
might be produced (with nonzero frequency) when particle pairs are prepared in the
quantum state ψs. The types are described in the following table:
Pair type
Particle 1
Particle 2

{+1, +1, +1} {−1, −1, −1}

8.2 A Preliminary Bell Inequality
219
As before, the lists in the “Particle 1” and “Particle 2” columns tell us how a
particle which is a member of the indicated pair type will respond to all three possible
questions that might be put to it. So, for example, “{+1, −1, +1}” means that the
particle will be found spin-up along ˆa (if so measured!), spin-down along ˆb (if so
measured!), and spin-up along ˆc (if so measured!).
Notice that the frequencies Fi of the 8 different pair types are left unspeciﬁed. The
hope, of course, will be to pick values (as we were able to do in the previous section)
so that the statistical predictions of the local hidden variable theory will agree with
those of quantum mechanics.
But, as it turns out, this is impossible. The proof that it is impossible is, of course,
“Bell’s theorem”, which involves showing that the predictions of the local hidden
variable theory we are considering are constrained by a certain inequality (“Bell’s
inequality”) that the quantum mechanical predictions do not respect. In short, there
will be situations where – no matter exactly how the frequencies Fi are selected –
the local hidden variable theory cannot reproduce the quantum mechanical statistics.
We develop the proof in the remainder of this section in a way that is a little simpler
than what Bell did in his original 1964 paper; in subsequent sections we return to
consider Bell’s own way of presenting things.
Notice ﬁrst that we can express probabilities for speciﬁc possible outcomes in
terms of the frequencies Fi that appear in the table. For example, suppose that particle
1 is measured along the ˆa direction and particle 2 is measured along the ˆb direction.
What, for example, is the probability Pab(++) that both measurements have outcome
“spin-up”? To answer, we can simply scan down the table on the previous page and
look for the pair types for which this will occur. In particular, here, we need a “+1”
as the ﬁrst entry in the Particle 1 column (indicating that Particle 1 will be measured
“spin-up” in the ˆa direction) and a “+1” as the second entry in the Particle 2 column
(indicating that Particle 2 will be measured “spin-up” in the ˆb direction).
I ﬁnd the appropriate entries in row 3 and row 5. This means that pairs of type
3 and type 5 will yield the outcomes “particle 1 is spin-up along ˆa” and “particle
2 is spin-up along ˆb”. (Pairs of all the other types will yield at least one different
outcome if the particles’ spins are measured along ˆa and ˆb respectively.) And so the
probability of seeing that particular outcome (“++”) is just the probability that a
given particle pair is of type 3 or type 5. That is:
Pab(++) = F3 + F5.
(8.6)
Let’s practice with a couple of other examples. What is the probability Pbc(++) of
seeing both particles “spin-up” given that particle 1 is measured along the ˆb direction
and particle 2 is measured along the ˆc direction? I ﬁnd:
Pbc(++) = F2 + F6.
(8.7)
And similarly
Pac(++) = F2 + F5.
(8.8)

220

Bell’s Theorem
Make sure you see where these equations are coming from (and make sure you
agree with what I wrote!).
Now, amazingly, we are already in a position to write down a (preliminary example
of a) Bell inequality. Since the Fi’s represent the frequencies with which pairs of
different types are supposed to be produced when we create a particle pair in the
singlet state, they must all be positive and they should add to 1. And so it must be
the case that
F2 + F5 ≤F3 + F5 + F2 + F6
(8.9)
since the right hand side is the same as the left hand side plus two additional terms
which cannot be smaller than zero! But this means that, for a local hidden variable
theory of the sort being considered here, it must be the case that
Pac(++) ≤Pab(++) + Pbc(++).
(8.10)
That is, no matter how we pick the frequencies Fi, a theory in which spin mea-
surements simply reveal pre-existing values will have to make statistical predictions
that obey Equation (or actually, Inequality) (8.10).
Now the incredible thing is that it is possible to choose directions ˆa, ˆb, and ˆc
such that this same inequality is violated by the quantum mechanical predictions.
So let us recall in more detail how the relevant quantum predictions come about.
In Chap.2, we saw that the one-particle spin states ψ±n (corresponding to particles
being deﬁnitely spin up or deﬁnitely spin down along the ˆn axis, an angle θ down
from the z-axis in the x-z-plane) were given by
ψ+n =
cos(θ/2)
sin(θ/2)

= cos(θ/2)ψ+z + sin(θ/2)ψ−z
(8.11)
and
ψ−n =
 sin(θ/2)
−cos(θ/2)

= sin(θ/2)ψ+z −cos(θ/2)ψ−z.
(8.12)
It is fairly straightforward to invert this relationship (solving for ψ±z in terms of
ψ±n). The result is that
ψ+z = cos(θ/2)ψ+n + sin(θ/2)ψ−n
(8.13)
and
ψ−z = sin(θ/2)ψ+n −cos(θ/2)ψ−n.
(8.14)
This allows us to rewrite the singlet state as follows:
ψs =

(8.15)

8.2 A Preliminary Bell Inequality
221
From this, we can read off (as the square of the coefﬁcient in front of the ψ1
+zψ2
+n
term) the probability of seeing two “spin-up” outcomes when we measure particle
1 along the z-axis and particle 2 along a direction that is an angle θ away from the
z-axis. This is simply:
Pz,θ(++) = 1
2 sin2(θ/2).
(8.16)
Since (as we have seen) the singlet state is symmetrical – and since what direction
we choose to call the z-direction is ultimately arbitrary – this formula turns out to
give the quantum mechanical probability for a “++” outcome whenever the two
measurement directions have an angle θ between them (whether one of them is the
“z-axis” or not). So we can use this general formula now to compute the quantum
mechanical prediction for all three of the probabilities that appeared in Eq.(8.10),
our baby Bell inequality.
Suppose we pick the three directions ˆa, ˆb, and ˆc as follows: pick ˆb = ˆz, and then
pick ˆa and ˆc to be tilted at angle θ away from the z-axis, in opposite directions. Then
we have that, according to QM,
P QM
ab (++) = 1
2 sin2(θ/2)
(8.17)
and similarly
P QM
bc
(++) = 1
2 sin2(θ/2).
(8.18)
What about P QM
ac (++)? The angle between ˆa and ˆc is 2θ so the general formula
gives
P QM
ac (++) = 1
2 sin2(θ).
(8.19)
Now it is a plain and simple mathematical fact that
1
2 sin2(θ) ≤1
2 sin2(θ/2) + 1
2 sin2(θ/2)
(8.20)
isfalseforθ ≤π/2.Thebiggestviolationoftheinequalityoccursforθ = π/3 = 60◦.
In that case we have
P QM
ab (++) = 1
8,
(8.21)
P QM

(++) = 1
8,
(8.22)
and
P QM
ac (++) = 3

(8.23)

222

Bell’s Theorem
And, as plain as day, it is not the case that
3
8 ≤1
8 + 1
8.
(8.24)
Bell’s inequality is violated by the quantum mechanical predictions.
And so there is, in principle, a certain kind of experiment that we could do to
test whether quantum mechanics is right, or the type of local hidden variable theory
suggested by EPR is right. The two theories make empirically distinguishable pre-
dictions. What is the experiment, exactly? Well, we would need to produce a bunch
of spin 1/2 particle pairs, have them ﬂy off in opposite directions toward Stern–
Gerlach measuring devices which could be oriented along one of the possible three
directions (ˆa, ˆb, or ˆc). For reasons that we will discuss further in the next section,
it should ideally be the case that the measurement direction on each side be chosen
randomly and at the last possible second before the particles arrive.
Then we would simply keep track of how often, when the ˆa-spin of particle 1 was
measured and the ˆb-spin of particle 2 was measured, both measurements yielded the
“spin-up” outcome. That is, we would empirically measure Pab(++). And similarly
for Pbc(++) and Pac(++). And then at the end of the day we would compare these
probabilities. If Bell’s inequality
Pac(++) ≤Pab(++) + Pbc(++)
(8.25)
was respected by the experimental data, it would constitute a refutation of Quan-
tum Mechanics and a vindication of the local hidden variables theory; whereas if
the measured probabilities agreed with the QM predictions it would constitute an
experimental refutation of the local hidden variable theory.
8.3
The Real Bell (and the CHSH) Inequality
Although the experiment just sketched would indeed be possible and gives one the
ﬂavor of how a Bell inequality can be experimentally tested, the inequality derived
in the previous section is really just a kind of preliminary toy example of a Bell-type
inequality. In this section we show how the real Bell inequality (that is, the actual
inequality ﬁrst derived by Bell in his 1964 paper), as well as the closely-related
“CHSH Inequality,” can be developed. These, as it turns out, suggest far superior
types of experimental tests which we will discuss in the following section.
To motivate this discussion, perhaps it is worth thinking about why the experi-
mental test proposed at the end of the last section is somehow less than ideal. Part
of the answer is simply that it is very inefﬁcient: if the directions (along which to
measure the spins of the two particles) are selected randomly for each particle pair,
then only about 1/3 of the time will we happen to make one of the three types of
measurements (namely, ab, bc, or ac) that are relevant to Eq.(8.10). So 2/3 of the
data – 2/3 of the particle pairs produced – are simply wasted.

8.3 The Real Bell (and the CHSH) Inequality
223
You are probably thinking that one could eliminate the waste by just ﬁxing the
Stern–Gerlach device on the particle 1 side in the ˆa direction, and similarly ﬁxing the
Stern–Gerlach device on the particle 2 side in the ˆb direction, collecting data for (say)
a million particle pairs, then switching the detectors to the bc orientations, collecting
more data, and then ﬁnally switching to the ac orientations and collecting a last set of
data.Andthatistrue.Youcoulddothat(andsomeoftheearlyexperimentswerealong
these lines). But (as hinted at previously) it is important that the orientations of the
measuring devices be set randomly and at the last possible second before the particles
arrive – ideally, so late that the measurement on particle 1 cannot be inﬂuenced (by
any signal propagating at the speed of light or slower) by the orientation of particle
2’s measuring device (or vice versa).
To understand this, imagine that both detectors are just ﬁxed in place – say, in the
ac orientation – for a run of many particle pairs. Then each particle pair could “know”,
already when it is created, and without any violation of local causality, that particle
1 will be measured along the ˆa direction and particle 2 will be measured along the
ˆc direction. But one could imagine that, in such a circumstance, the particle source
would be free to emit particles not only of the 8 types captured in our earlier table, but
also “rogue” types in which, for example, particle 1 has properties {+1, −1, −1} and
particle 2 has properties {+1, −1, +1}. After all, if the particles “know” in advance
that they will each be measured along particular, pre-determined directions, there is
no reason the pre-existing spin components along all three directions should have to
be perfectly correlated. Similarly, if the particle pairs “know”, in advance of being
emitted, the directions along which their spins will later be measured, it might be
possible for the source to adjust the frequencies Fi in response: for example, perhaps
when the detectors are in the ab conﬁguration, F1 is big and F2 is small, whereas
when the detectors are in the bc conﬁguration, F1 is small and F2 is big.
It should be clear that in either of these scenarios (“rogue” particle types, or
measurement-axis-dependent pair frequencies), the straightforward type of hidden
variable model we’ve described is no longer required and our derivation of the
inequality would not go through. Turning this around, then, it should make sense
that, in order for the straightforward type of hidden variable model we’ve described
to genuinely be required by locality, we must have in mind an experimental setup in
which it is impossible for the particles to know in advance along which axes their
spins will be measured. So if at the end of the day we want a clean experimental
discrimination between Quantum Mechanics and the sort of local theory implied
by the EPR-Bohm argument, the experimental test must implement strict “Einstein
locality” conditions in which the device setting on each side is only determined while
the particles are in ﬂight, and, indeed, determined sufﬁciently late that information
about it is locally inaccessible to the measurement on the other side.
We will discuss this point a bit more in the following sections; for now, sufﬁce it to
say that for a variety of technical and practical reasons, it would be nice to develop a
Bell type inequality that doesn’t focus so narrowly on one speciﬁc outcome for each
of just three possible measurements, but instead embraces all possible measurements
and outcomes in a more democratic way.

224

Bell’s Theorem
To begin to develop such an inequality, let us consider the “correlation coefﬁcient”
C(ˆn1, ˆn2), deﬁned as the expected value of the product of the two measurement out-
comes when measurements are made along direction ˆn1 and ˆn2 on the two particles.
Since the product of the outcomes is either +1 (if the outcomes are “++” or “−−”)
or −1 (if the outcomes are “+−” or “−+”), the correlation coefﬁcient is thus the
probability for “++” plus the probability for “−−” but then minus the probability
for “+−” and minus the probability for “−+”:
C(ˆn1, ˆn2) = Pn1n2(++) + Pn1n2(−−) −Pn1n2(+−) −Pn1n2(−+).
(8.26)
Using the same technique we used in the previous section, i.e., reading off the
probabilities as the squares of the coefﬁcients of the four terms in Eq.(8.15), it is easy
to work out that the Quantum Mechanical prediction for the correlation coefﬁcient
is
C QM(ˆn1, ˆn2) = 1

where θ is the angle between ˆn1 and ˆn2. Note that, for θ = 0, C = −1, meaning
that the two outcomes are perfectly anti-correlated (always opposite). Whereas for
θ = 90◦, C = 0, meaning that there is no correlation at all between the outcomes.
This is all consistent with what we have seen before, namely, that if the two particles’
spins are measured along the same direction, the individual outcomes are necessarily
opposite, whereas if they are measured along orthogonal axes, a “+1” outcome on
one side is equally likely to be accompanied by a “+1” or a “−1” on the other side,
and so on.
What about the local hidden variable theory described in the previous section?
Writing
C(ˆn1, ˆn2) = Pn1n2(++) + Pn1n2(−−) −Pn1n2(+−) −Pn1n2(−+)

we see that each of the four probabilities on the right hand side can be expressed in
terms of the frequencies Fi from our table. For given measurement directions ˆn1 and
ˆn2, each frequency will appear, either with a plus sign or a minus sign. For example:
C(ˆa, ˆb) = F3 + F5 + F4 + F6 −F1 −F2 −F7 −F8.
(8.29)
(Take a minute and make sure you understand exactly how I got this!) Similarly:
C(ˆa, ˆc) = F2 + F5 + F4 + F7 −F1 −F3 −F6 −F8
(8.30)
and
C(ˆb, ˆc) = F2 + F3 + F6 + F7 −F1 −F4 −F5 −F8.
(8.31)

8.3 The Real Bell (and the CHSH) Inequality
225
But then, as before, obviously-true inequalities involving the Fi can be seen to
be equivalent to inequalities involving the correlation coefﬁcients for different mea-
surement settings. For example, the trivial inequality
|F3 + F6 −F7 −F2| ≤F2 + F3 + F6 + F7
(8.32)
turns out to be equivalent to
C(ˆa, ˆb) −C(ˆa, ˆc)
 ≤1 + C(ˆb, ˆc).
(8.33)
This is actually the original “Bell inequality” that Bell derived (using a somewhat
different method) in his original 1964 paper, and it is easy to see that it is violated
by the Quantum Mechanical predictions. For ˆa, ˆb, and ˆc as before (with ˆb in the
middle and then ˆa and ˆc θ away in opposite directions) the greatest violation is
again achieved for θ = π/3 = 60◦. So then C QM(ˆa, ˆb) = −cos(60◦) = −1/2 and
C QM(ˆa, ˆc) = −cos(120◦) = +1/2 and C QM(ˆb, ˆc) = −1/2 so we have
−1

 ≤1 −1

(8.34)
which reduces to
1 ≤1
2
(8.35)
which is deﬁnitely not true! So the QM predictions violate Bell’s Inequality, which
is a constraint on the correlations (between the outcomes on the two sides) for the
kind of theory implied by the EPR-Bohm argument.
One can develop a second, closely-related Bell-type inequality by starting with
the trivial inequality
|F5 + F4 −F1 −F8| ≤F1 + F4 + F5 + F8
(8.36)
which turns out to be equivalent to
C(ˆa′, ˆb) + C(ˆa′, ˆc)
 ≤1 −C(ˆb, ˆc)
(8.37)
where ˆa′ may be (but need not be!) the same direction as the previous ˆa.
Note, ﬁnally, that by adding Equations (actually, inequalities) (8.33) and (8.37)
we arrive at
C(ˆa, ˆb) −C(ˆa, ˆc)
 +
C(ˆa′, ˆb) + C(ˆa′, ˆc)
 ≤2
(8.38)
which is a particularly important Bell-type inequality called the “CHSH inequality”
(after Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt who ﬁrst derived it in 1969) [3].

226

Bell’s Theorem
The CHSH inequality is particularly well-suited to experimental test, because only
two measurement angles appear in each “wing” of the experiment. That is, suppose
that for each particle pair that is created, Particle 1 is sent toward Alice, who will
(randomly and at the last possible second) choose to measure the spin of Particle 1
along either the direction ˆa or the direction ˆa′. And similarly, Particle 2 is sent toward
Bob, who will (randomly and at the last possible second) choose to measure the spin
of Particle 2 along either the direction ˆb or the direction ˆc.
Alice and Bob then record their respective outcomes for that particular particle
pair, and get ready for the particles from the next pair to arrive. After collecting data
for some time, Alice and Bob meet somewhere and compare notes. Importantly, every
single outcome of every single measurement on every single particle pair gets used
to determine an empirical value for one of the four correlation coefﬁcients appearing
in the CHSH inequality. So none of the data is wasted.
What does QM predict for the CHSH parameter? Well, suppose we pick the
directions ˆa, ˆa′, ˆb, and ˆc as follows: ˆa will be the z-axis, and ˆa′ will be the x-axis.
Then ˆb will be halfway between the x- and z-axes, i.e., 45◦down from the z-axis
toward the x-axis. And ˆc will be 45◦away from the x-axis in the other direction, i.e.,
135◦down from the z-axis toward the x-axis, i.e., halfway between the x-axis and
the negative z-axis. See Fig.8.1.
These turn out to be the directions that give the greatest possible discrepancy
between the local hidden variable and the quantum mechanical predictions. To see
exactly what QM predicts, note that the angle between ˆa and ˆb is 45◦, so, according
to Eq.(8.27)
C QM(ˆa, ˆb) = −cos(45◦) = −1/

Experiments
Let us then review some of the actual experiments of this sort.
The ﬁrst really systematic test of the CHSH inequality was done by Alain Aspect
and collaborators in 1982 [4]. Instead of using pairs of spin 1/2 particles in the spin
singlet state, they used pairs of photons (emitted from excited Calcium atoms) whose
polarizations are entangled in a way that is perfectly analogous to the singlet state
we’ve been discussing. Note, however, that there is a factor-of-2 difference between
the angles involved in the spin 1/2 case and the photon polarization case. Whereas, for
example, the two possible spin directions of a spin 1/2 particle are opposite (“up” and
“down”, different by 180◦) the two possible polarizations of a photon are orthogonal
(e.g., “horizontal” and “vertical”, different by 90◦). In addition, whereas spin-1/2
particles in the singlet state display perfect anti-correlation (when their spins are
measured along the same axes), the photon pairs instead display perfect (positive)
correlation (when their polarizations are measured along the same axes). So the
quantum prediction for the polarization correlation coefﬁcient C QM(ˆn1, ˆn2) in the
case of photons is cos(2θ) rather than the −cos(θ) we saw previously for the case
of spin-1/2 particles. But otherwise everything is just as we’ve been discussing.
A schematic diagram of the experiment and a graph of their data are reproduced
(from the 1982 paper) in Fig.8.2. There is essentially perfect agreement between the
experimental results and the QM predictions, and the CHSH parameter (that is, the
combination of correlation coefﬁcients that can be no greater than 2 for local hidden
variable theories) was
Sexpt = 2.697 ± 0.015,
(8.44)
i.e., well above the maximum possible value (namely, 2) allowed for the local hidden
variable theories.

Bell’s Theorem
Fig. 8.2 The left panel shows a schematic diagram of the setup for the Aspect et al. experiment,
Ref. [4]; the right panel shows their data. The essentially perfect agreement with C QM = cos(2θ) is
evident. In this experiment they found the CHSH parameter to be Sexpt = 2.697 ± 0.015, i.e., well
above the maximum value of 2 allowed for local hidden variable theories and in excellent agreement
with the QM prediction (which, for detector efﬁciency and alignment reasons) for their experiment
was SQM = 2.70 ± 0.05 (i.e., slightly less than 2
√
2). (Reprinted with permission from A. Aspect,
P. Grangier, G. Roger, Physical Review Letters, 49, 91–94, 1982, by the American Physical Society.)
Here is how Aspect et al. summarize their conclusions:
...our experiment yields the strongest violation of Bell’s inequalities ever achieved, and
excellent agreement with quantum mechanics. Since it is a straightforward transposition
of the ideal Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen-Bohm scheme, the experimental procedure is very
simple, and needs no auxiliary measurements as in previous experiments with single-channel
polarizers. We are thus led to the rejection of realistic [i.e., “hidden variable”] local theories
if we accept the assumption that there is no bias in the detected samples: Experiments support
this natural assumption.
Only two loopholes remain open for advocates of realistic theories without action at a dis-
tance. The ﬁrst one, exploiting the low efﬁciencies of detectors, could be ruled out by a
feasible experiment. The second one, exploiting the static character of all previous exper-
iments, could also be ruled out by a ‘timing experiment’ with variable analyzers now in
progress [4].
What is this “assumption that there is no bias in the detected samples”? The idea
here is that the committed advocate of a local hidden variable theory could claim
that the CHSH inequality wasn’t really shown to be violated because, actually, only
a small fraction of all emitted photon pairs were successfully detected. (This has
to do with the fact that the photon source in this experiment emits photon pairs
isotropically, so only the occasional pairs which just happen to be aimed right at the
detectors, will actually be detected.) “If only” (says the conspiracy theorist here) “all
of the pairs had been detected, we might have found a CHSH parameter less than
2.” And, indeed, that is in principle possible, although it seems exceedingly unlikely.
In order for the experimental results to be biased in this way, there would need
to be some reason why the polarization correlations between pairs which happen
to be aimed at the detectors, are signiﬁcantly different than those between pairs
going in other directions. But neither quantum mechanics nor any other available

8.4 Experiments

Fig. 8.3 Aspect et al.’s schematic diagram of their “Experimental test of Bell’s inequalities using
time-varying analyzers” from Ref. [5]. They write: “timing experiment with optical switches. Each
switching device (CI , CI I ) is followed by two polarizers in two different orientations. Each com-
bination is equivalent to a polarizer switched fast between two orientations.” (Reprinted with
permission from A. Aspect, J. Dalibard, G. Roger, Physical Review Letters, 49, 1804–1807, 1982,
by the American Physical Society.)
idea provides any basis for suspecting such a thing. So this way of trying to elude
the apparent implications of Aspect’s ﬁrst experiment seems like grasping at straws.
Nevertheless, increasing the fraction of particle pairs detected (i.e., working to “close
the detector efﬁciency loophole”) is something that experimenters worked on in
subsequent experiments.
The second “loophole” that Aspect mentions, however – having to do with the
“static character” of this and previous experiments – is a bit of a more serious issue.
Indeed, this is precisely the issue I already raised in the previous section: in order to
really discriminate quantum mechanics from local hidden variable theories of the sort
implied by the EPR-Bohm argument, the measurement devices should not remain
static; instead, the settings (that is, for Alice, the choice between measuring along ˆa
and ˆa′, and, for Bob, the choice between measuring along ˆb and ˆc) should be made
randomly and at the last possible second.
In a follow-up experiment (also published in 1982!) Aspect and his collaborators
devised an ingenious mechanism for switching between different measurement set-
tings. (See Fig.8.3) Instead of physically rotating a polarization measuring device
(which would simply not be feasible on the required time scales), each photon was
shunted to one or the other of two static measuring devices by an “acousto-optical
switch” consisting of a cell of water in which a (roughly) 50 MHz acoustic standing
wave is set up. During the part of the cycle in which the amplitude of the standing
wave is small, incident photons simply pass straight through. But during the part of
the cycle in which the amplitude is large, the water (with now a spatially-varying
density) acts like a diffraction grating and photons passing through are deﬂected
at some angle. The 50MHz standing wave frequency corresponds to about a 10
nanosecond period during which any incident photons are shunted in the one direc-
tion, before switching to the other direction. This timescale can be compared to the

230
8
Bell’s Theorem
time – L/c ≈40 nanoseconds – it would take a signal, propagating at the speed
of light, to get from Alice’s measuring device to Bob’s (or vice versa). If the fast
back-and-forth switching between the two measurement directions on either side is
considered “effectively random” (and note here that the frequencies were deliber-
ately made incommensurate on the two sides) one can thus say that the choice of
measurement settings on the two sides are spacelike separated. As Aspect et al. write:
The new feature of this experiment is that we change the settings of the polarizers, at a rate
greater than c/L. The ideal scheme has not been completed since the change is not truly
random, but rather quasiperiodic. Nevertheless, the two switches on the two sides are driven
by different generators at different frequencies. It is then very natural to assume that they
function in an uncorrelated way.
A more ideal experiment with random and complete switching would be necessary for a
fully conclusive argument against the whole class of supplementary-parameter [i.e., hidden
variable] theories obeying Einstein’s [local] causality. However, our observed violation of
Bell’s inequalities indicates that the experimental accuracy was good enough for pointing
out a hypothetical discrepancy with the predictions of quantum mechanics. No such effect
was observed [5].
Thus, again in this improved version of the experiment, results consistent with QM
– and inconsistent with a Bell-type inequality – were observed.
Some of the possible improvements described by Aspect et al. were implemented
by a new experiment performed in 1998 by Gregor Weihs, Anton Zeilinger, and
collaborators [6]. They used a new (more controllable and more efﬁcient) source of
polarization-entangled photon pairs (called “type-II parametric down-conversion”).
The photons were carried from the central source to the polarization measuring
stations (at opposite ends of the campus of the University of Innsbruck in Austria)
along ﬁbre optic cables. And, crucially, the experiment used “high speed physical
random number generators and fast electro-optic modulators” to arrange for the
choice of measurement axis (along which each particle’s polarization was measured)
to be made, for the ﬁrst time, genuinely randomly and at unambiguously space-like
separation from the similar choice occuring in the other wing of the experiment.1
Weihs et al. report typical measured CHSH parameter values of S = 2.73 ± 0.02 –
in excellent agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions (as applicable to
their particular experimental setup) and in clear violation of the CHSH inequality.
The experiment by Weihs et al. remained essentially the state-of-the-art until
quite recently, when three different groups published results showing that the QM
predictions remain correct even when the various “loopholes” described originally
by Aspect are simultaneously closed [7–9].
1Technical detail: actually, instead of using the output of the random number generator to physically
rotate the polarization measuring device (which could never be done quickly enough), the output was
fed into an electro-optic modulator which rotated (by one of two possible amounts) the polarization
of the incoming photon.

What Does It Mean?
I have been describing Bell’s inequalities as constraints on the predictions of local
hidden variable theories of the sort implied by the EPR-Bohm argument we reviewed
at the beginning of the chapter. From this point of view, the experiments we surveyed
in the last section prove (to me, at least, quite convincingly) that the predictions of
QM are correct and the predictions of the local hidden variable theories are simply
wrong. And leaving aside the conspiracy theorists, everybody agrees about this.
There is, however, a surprising amount of controversy about what, exactly, should
be inferred from the empirical violations of Bell inequalities.
In particular, many people have taken Bell’s theorem as a proof that hidden vari-
ables theories are not viable.2 Eugene Wigner, for example, wrote (about the pos-
sibility of a hidden variables “completion” of ordinary QM) that the proof of von
Neumann “uses assumptions which, in my opinion, can quite reasonably be ques-
tioned.” (Here Wigner was in total agreement with Bell, who recall showed in his
1966 paper that von Neumann’s assumptions were in fact totally arbitrary and unwar-
ranted.) But Wigner goes on to state:
In my opinion, the most convincing argument against the theory of hidden variables was
presented by J.S. Bell [10].
A similar remark has been made by the eminent theoretician Rudolf Peierls:
If people are obstinate in opposing the accepted view they can think of many new possi-
bilities, but there is no sensible view of hidden variables which doesn’t conﬂict with these
experimental results [i.e., Aspect’s experiments]. That was proved by John Bell, who has
great merit in establishing this. Prior to that there was a proof due to the mathematician von
Neumann, but he made an assumption which is not really necessary [11].
More recently, Stephn Hawking summarized the situation as follows:
Einstein’s view was what would now be called a hidden variable theory. Hidden variable
theories might seem to be the most obvious way to incorporate the Uncertainty Principle into
physics.Theyformthe basisofthe mental picture ofthe universe,heldbymanyscientists,and
almost all philosophers of science. But these hidden variable theories are wrong. The British
physicist, John Bell ... devised an experimental test that would distinguish hidden variable
theories. When the experiment was carried out carefully, the results were inconsistent with
hidden variables. Thus it seems that even God is bound by the Uncertainty Principle.... God
does play dice with the universe [12].
Itiseasytomultiplyexamples.Inareviewarticleon“OneHundredYearsofQuantum
Physics”, Daniel Kleppner and Roman Jackiw of MIT wrote, about the experiments
reviewed in the last section, that “[t]heir collective data came down decisively against
the possibility of hidden variables. For most scientists this resolved any doubt about
the validity of quantum mechanics” [13]. And in a similar article celebrating the 100
year anniversary of QM, Max Tegmark and John Wheeler wrote the following:
2Most of the quotes in the following paragraph were collected by Jean Bricmont in Sect.7.5 of
Making Sense of Quantum Mechanics.

Bell’s Theorem
Could the apparent quantum randomness be replaced by some kind of unknown quantity
carried out inside particles, so-called ‘hidden variables’? CERN theorist John Bell showed
that in this case, quantities that could be measured in certain difﬁcult experiments would
inevitablydisagreewithstandardquantumpredictions.Aftermanyyears,technologyallowed
researchers to conduct these experiments and eliminate hidden variables as a possibility [14].
In their preface to the published proceedings of a conference honoring Bell 10 years
after his death, Reinhold Bertlmann (a long-time colleague, collaborator, and friend
of Bell’s... recall his mis-matched socks from Chap.4!) and Anton Zeilinger (one of
the authors of the Innsbruck experiment paper discussed in the last section and one
of the most prominent experimental quantum physicists) explained how, although
Bell had seemingly opened the door to hidden variables by refuting von Neumann’s
supposed impossibility proof,
he immediately dealt them [i.e., hidden variables] a major blow. In 1964 ... he showed that
any hidden variables theory, which obeys Einstein’s requirement of locality, i.e., no inﬂuence
travelling faster than the speed of light, would automatically be in conﬂict with quantum
mechanics. [...] While a very tiny [experimental] loophole in principle remains for local
realism, it is a very safe position to assume that quantum mechanics has deﬁnitely been
shown to be the right theory. Thus, a very deep philosophical question, namely, whether or
not events observed in the quantum world can be described by an underlying deterministic
theory, has been answered by experiment, thanks to the momentous achievement of John
Bell [15].
What is going on here? How can all these people claim that the experimental violation
of Bell’s inequality somehow refutes the possibility of an underlying deterministic
or hidden variable completion of quantum mechanics, when such a theory (namely,
the de Broglie - Bohm pilot-wave theory) already actually exists and is demonstrably
consistent with these experiments?
Part of the answer, to be sure, is that most physicists are simply not as aware
as they should be about the existence of the pilot-wave theory. They’ve heard of it
but never looked into it and hence don’t actually understand how it works and, as
we’ve seen, they dismiss the broad category of hidden variable theories (of which
the pilot-wave theory is just one concrete example) on the grounds that they have
been ruled out, experimentally, as shown by Bell. There is a kind of rich and tragic
irony here, in citing Bell as having supposedly refuted hidden variables theories (and
hence entrenching the unjustiﬁed belief that the pilot-wave theory cannot be right and
must not be worth looking into) when, as we have seen, Bell’s theorem was actually
inspired by Bohm’s 1952 pilot-wave theory papers, and indeed Bell remained far
and away the pilot-wave theory’s greatest champion until his death in 1990.
But there is more going on, in the citation of Bell’s theorem as refuting the hidden
variables program, than mere ignorance of the pilot-wave theory. Some of the people
who make this kind of argument do know about the pilot-wave theory, and reject it
on the grounds that it is non-local and hence in apparent conﬂict with relativity. This
point of view was perhaps best encapsulated by David Mermin’s remark:
To those for whom nonlocality is anathema, Bell’s theorem ﬁnally spells the death of the
hidden-variables program [16].

8.5 What Does It Mean?
233
The idea here, apparently, is that Bell’s inequality – which we now know from exper-
iment is false – follows from the conjunction of two premises: locality and hidden
variables. (Or sometimes, instead, of “hidden variables” people will say “determin-
ism” or “realism” – or something essentially equivalent but a little more cryptic called
“counter-factual deﬁniteness”.) But if these two premises, together, imply something
that is false, at least one of the premises must be wrong. According to this viewpoint,
then, we have to choose between the following two options:
1. Uphold locality and reject hidden variables, i.e., retain consistency with relativis-
tic causality and admit (as everyone has told us we should have done anyway)
that Einstein was wrong and Bohr was right regarding the question of whether
the quantum mechanical description of reality can be considered complete.
2. Uphold hidden variables and reject locality, i.e., side with the somewhat senile
Einstein in his stubborn, arbitrary, and philosophical demand that “God does not
play dice” and insist that, despite being one of the most successful and highly-
conﬁrmed theories in the history of science, relativity is somehow wrong.
If those were the two available options, it would indeed be a no-brainer. Obviously
we should choose option 1. Selecting option 2 would be crazy.
In this way of looking at the matter, non-locality is the price one has to pay
for attempting to restore determinism (and/or “realism”) to quantum theory... and
the price, obviously, is simply too high. Maintaining consistency with relativistic
causality (i.e., locality) is mandatory, and if that means we need to abandon the quest
for a more complete underlying model of quantum phenomena, so be it; indeed, most
would say, good riddance.
That, I think, captures the viewpoint of the vast majority of physicists today. But,
I believe, it is completely and utterly and hopelessly wrong. We do not face anything
like the choice between options 1 and 2 above, and indeed, at the end of the day,
Bell’s theorem tells us absolutely nothing about “hidden variables” or determinism
or counter-factual deﬁniteness or “realism” or whether the moon is there or not when
you aren’t looking [17] or any of these sorts of things that people so frequently say
it is fundamentally about. Everybody is just simply wrong here, because they have
forgotten (or, more commonly, because they never understood in the ﬁrst place) a
crucial part of the broader context of Bell’s theorem.
In particular, they have forgotten the EPR argument – which, remember, is sup-
posed to be a proof that deterministic hidden variables are required, in the ﬁrst place,
precisely in order to avoid non-locality. The sort of hidden variable theory that Bell’s
theorem ends up ruling out, that is, is not something that Bell – or for that matter
Einstein – just dreamed up. It’s not something they just liked or randomly felt like
considering. It’s something they considered speciﬁcally because they recognized it
as the only possible hope for maintaining locality in the face of the perfect EPR
correlations.
Bell’s theorem, then – taken here to mean the proof that local hidden variable
theories are wrong – must be understood as the second part of an overall two-part
argument, the ﬁrst part of which is the EPR argument. Schematically, the two-part
argument goes like this:

234
8
Bell’s Theorem
EPR: locality →X
Bell: X →conﬂict with experiment
Here “X” stands for something like “local deterministic hidden variables”, but some-
how the logic is easier to grasp by suppressing this. Obviously, if locality →X, and X
in turn implies a conﬂict with experiment, then we cannot maintain X, which means
we cannot maintain locality (because locality entails X!).
So according to this view, what should be concluded from the experimentally
observed violations of Bell-type inequalities is not that we cannot have hidden vari-
ables (we can!), and not even that we must choose between hidden variables and
locality. It only appears that we face such a choice if we look only at the second,
Bell-part of the two-part argument. But if we remember also the ﬁrst, EPR-part of the
argument, we remember that the choice is highly constrained: keeping locality but
abandoning hidden variables is not an available option at all. We must, that is, simply
conclude that locality – that the prohibition on faster-than-light causation that seems
somehow to be implied by relativity theory – is false. Relativistic local causality
is wrong, is in conﬂict with experimental data. Faster-than-light causal inﬂuences
really exist in Nature!
That is, to be sure, a shocking conclusion and raises all kinds of pressing questions
that proliferate in all directions. But we will not be able to pursue them in detail here.
I will instead close this section by sharing that this “alternative” view – according
to which the upshot of Bell’s theorem is that locality is false – is not only my view
(and that of some other contemporary physicists and philosophers of science), but
was also the view of the person in the best possible position to understand Bell’s
reasoning: Bell himself.
In his introductory remarks at a 1984 conference, for example, Bell said that
“the real problem with quantum theory” is the “essential conﬂict between any sharp
formulation and fundamental relativity” and went on to speak of the “incompatibility,
at the deepest level, between the two fundamental pillars of contemporary theory”
(meaning quantum theory and relativity theory) [18].
Indeed, Bell even went so far as to suggest, in response to his theorem and the
relevant experimental data, the rejection of “fundamental relativity” and the return
to a Lorentzian view in which there is a dynamically privileged (though probably
empirically undetectable) reference frame:
“It may well be that a relativistic version of [quantum] theory, while Lorentz invariant and
local at the observational level, may be necessarily non-local and with a preferred frame (or
aether) at the fundamental level” [19].
And elsewhere:
“... I would say the cheapest resolution is something like going back to relativity as it was
before Einstein, when people like Lorentz and Poincaré thought that there was an aether
– a preferred frame of reference – but that our measuring instruments were distorted by
motion in such a way that we could not detect motion through the aether. Now, in that way
you can imagine that there is a preferred frame of reference, and in this preferred frame
of reference things do go faster than light. .... Behind the apparent Lorentz invariance of
the phenomena, there is a deeper level which is not Lorentz invariant... [This] pre-Einstein

8.5 What Does It Mean?
235
position of Lorentz and Poincaré, Larmor and Fitzgerald, was perfectly coherent, and is
not inconsistent with relativity theory. The idea that there is an aether, and these Fitzgerald
contractions and Larmor dilations occur, and that as a result the instruments do not detect
motion through the aether – that is a perfectly coherent point of view” [20].
Why did Bell take so seriously these sorts of ideas, which everybody else today
regards as completely outmoded and wrong? Because he thinks his theorem (and the
associated experimental evidence) proves that nonlocality is a fact of Nature, rather
than merely a defect of a type of theory we shouldn’t believe in.
And, as I have tried to explain, he thinks that because he sees his theorem as
building from where the EPR argument left off. He makes his reasoning particularly
clear in his classic 1981 paper, “Bertlmann’s Socks and the Nature of Reality”, in
which he reacts against the confusion described above (namely, forgetting about the
EPR argument and hence inferring a completely wrong conclusion from the theorem)
by laying out the two-part argument:
“Let me summarize once again the logic that leads to the impasse. The EPRB correlations
are such that the result of the experiment on one side immediately foretells that on the other,
whenever the analyzers happen to be parallel. If we do not accept the intervention on one
side as a causal inﬂuence on the other, we seem obliged to admit that the results on both
sides are determined in advance anyway, independently of the intervention on the other
side, by signals from the source and by the local magnet settings. [That’s the ﬁrst, EPR-
part of the argument.] But this has implications for non-parallel settings which conﬂict with
those of quantum mechanics. [That’s the second part, what is usually (alone) called “Bell’s
theorem”.] So we cannot dismiss intervention on one side as a causal inﬂuence on the other”
[21].
The last sentence expresses the overall conclusion of the two-part argument, that
(something about) the measurement on one side does inﬂuence, faster than light, the
results on the other side.
Earlier in the same paper, Bell rehearses the EPR argument and then underscores
its logical structure as follows:
“It is important to note that to the limited degree to which determinism plays a role in
the EPR argument, it is not assumed but inferred. What is held sacred is the principle of
‘local causality’ - or ‘no action at a distance’. Of course, mere correlation between distant
events does not by itself imply action at a distance, but only correlation between the signals
reaching the two places. These signals, in the idealized example of Bohm, must be sufﬁcient
to determine whether the particles go up or down. For any residual undeterminism could
only spoil the perfect correlation.
“It is remarkably difﬁcult to get this point across, that determinism is not a presupposition of
the analysis. There is a widespread and erroneous conviction that for Einstein[∗] determinism
was always the sacred principle. The quotability of his famous ‘God does not play dice’ has
not helped in this respect” [21].
The footnote referred to after the mention of Einstein reads:
“And his followers. My own ﬁrst paper on this subject [i.e., Bell’s 1964 paper presenting
“Bell’s theorem”] starts with a summary of the EPR argument from locality to deterministic
hidden variables. But the commentators have almost universally reported that it begins with
deterministic hidden variables” [21].

Bell’s Theorem
I personally ﬁnd this footnote remarkable and extremely revealing. Bell describes
himself as a follower of Einstein (meaning, presumably, that for him, like for Einstein,
it is ‘local causality’ rather than determinism which is the sacred principle) and
then says explicitly that “the commentators have almost universally” misunderstood
Bell’s theorem (as presented in his original 1964 paper) because they have failed to
appreciate the relevance of “the EPR argument from locality to deterministic hidden
variables.”
8.6
(Bell’s) Locality Inequality Theorem
As we saw, Bell claimed rather unambiguously in 1981 that his original 1964 paper
“starts with a summary of the EPR argument from locality to deterministic hidden
variables”. Whether or not Bell had actually had this two-part argument in mind
from the beginning, however, has been the focus of some discussion and debate
during the recent 50th anniversary celebration of Bell’s paper [22]. Sufﬁce it to say
that, on the one hand, it is clear that the introductory sections of Bell’s 1964 paper
begin by reminding the reader of what Einstein et al. had already established, several
decades earlier. But, on the other hand, Bell’s summary of the EPR argument is
indeed somewhat unfortunately brief and informal.
Happily, though, Bell continued to write and give talks about “Bell’s theorem”
throughout the period between 1964 and 1990, and in these talks and papers we see a
systematic attempt to clarify, sharpen, and make more explicit several aspects of the
reasoning, and thereby to pre-empt the sort of misunderstanding discussed above.
There are a couple of threads to this development. One is the thing we have just been
focusing on: making the EPR argument and its relationship to his new discovery
more explicit and clear.
But another thread, the one I want to focus on here, involved eliminating the
middle-man, so to speak – that is, constructing a simpler and more direct demonstra-
tion of the incompatibility between local causality and experiment (via an empirically
testable inequality). That is, whereas in Bell’s earlier presentations, he tends to use
the “two-part argument” described in the last section (locality implies deterministic
local hidden variables, and then deterministic local hidden variables imply a Bell-
type inequality), in his later presentations Bell instead lays out much more explicitly
what exactly he means by “locality” and then shows directly how locality entails (for
example) the CHSH inequality. So I thought it would be good to end the chapter by
rehearsing this more direct presentation that represents, I think, Bell’s mature sense
of what he proved and why it’s important.
We have already discussed Bell’s formulation of “locality” – way back in Chap.1
and then again in the context of the EPR argument in Chap.4 (and again in Chap.5).
See Fig.8.4 for a brief recap of the idea that, in a theory respecting relativistic
local causality, certain information (at appropriate space-like separation from a given
event) must necessarily be irrelevant for making predictions about the given event,
once what happens in the backward light cone of that event is sufﬁciently speciﬁed.

8.6 (Bell’s) Locality Inequality Theorem
237
Fig. 8.4 Space-time regions relevant to Bell’s formulation of local causality. Bell writes: “Full
speciﬁcation of what happens in 3 makes events in 2 irrelevant for predictions about 1in a locally
causal theory” [23]
Let us then sketch how the empirically-testable CHSH inequality can be derived
– directly – from Bell’s formulation of local causality. Consider the now-familiar
sort of experimental setup in which a source creates particle pairs in a state that QM
would describe as the singlet state. Of course, we want to be completely general here
and allow that perhaps some other (hidden variable type) theory turns out to provide
the correct description. So we will say that a given particle pair has state λ. This
might be just the QM singlet state ψs, or it might be the singlet state wave function
plus some additional “hidden variables”, or it might be something entirely distinct
from the QM wave function. We will keep it completely unspeciﬁed, completely
general.
So then, the particles ﬂy off in opposite directions toward measuring stations
womanned, and manned, respectively, by Alice and Bob. Alice uses some kind of
random number generator to pick, at the last possible second, an axis ˆn1 along which
to measure the spin of her particle, and Bob similarly uses an independent random
number generator to pick, also at the last possible second, an axis ˆn2 along which
to measure the spin of his particle. Let’s call Alice’s outcome A (with, as usual,
A = +1 meaning “spin up” and A = −1 meaning “spin down”) and similarly for
Bob’s outcome, B. All of these things are depicted on the space-time diagram in
Fig.8.5.
Note that we utilize the necessary condition for locality introduced in Chap.5: the
(large!) region 3 in Fig.8.5 not only shields off the past light cone of region 1 from
region 2 (as in the previous ﬁgure), but also vice versa. Thus a complete speciﬁcation
of the physical state of things in region 3 should render everything about region 2 (in
particular, both Bob’s randomly-selected setting ˆn2 and his outcome B) irrelevant for
predictions about region 1 – and it should also render everything about region 1 (in
particular, both Alice’s randomly-selected setting ˆn1 and her outcome A) irrelevant
for predictions about region 2.
This is the key idea behind the factorization of the joint probability P(A, B|ˆn1,
ˆn2, λ) for outcomes A and B (conditioned on all the things these outcomes might
depend upon). The deﬁnition of conditional probability implies that this joint prob-
ability can be written as
P(A, B|ˆn1, ˆn2, λ) = P(A|ˆn1, ˆn2, B, λ) · P(B|ˆn1, ˆn2, λ).

Fig. 8.5 Space-time diagram for the Bell experiment. The particle pair is emitted at the “ﬂash”
at the bottom of the diagram; world-lines for the two individual particles ﬂying apart in opposite
directions are represented by the gray dashed lines. The (large!) region 3 encompasses both particles
at some intermediate time and shields the two measurement regions, 1 and 2, from their overlapping
past light cones in the way that is required in Bell’s formulation of locality. (Note that the complete
description of the particle pair, λ, in region 3 need not assign speciﬁc facts to speciﬁc points in
space; this allows λ to be something like a two-particle quantum-mechanical wave function which,
as discussed in Chap.5, does not imply a clear ontology in 3D space.) The apparatus settings ˆn1 and
ˆn2 are shown as “inputs” to the measurements occuring in regions 1 and 2, whereas the individual
outcomes A and B are shown as “outputs”
But then, in each of the two factors on the right hand side, Bell’s deﬁnition of
local causality implies that the entries relating to the space-like separated region are
redundant. In particular, local causality requires that
P(A|ˆn1, ˆn2, B, λ) = P(A|ˆn1, λ)
(8.46)
and
P(B|ˆn1, ˆn2, λ) = P(B|ˆn2, λ).
(8.47)
In words: the probability for Alice’s experiment to have outcome A should only
depend on the state λ of the particle pair (for that run of the experiment) and the setting
ˆn1 of her apparatus; it should not depend on the setting of Bob’s apparatus or on the
outcome B of his experiment. And similarly, the probability for Bob’s experiment
to have outcome B should not depend on the setting of Alice’s apparatus.
Plugging in we see that, for a locally causal theory, the joint probability factorizes
as follows:
P(A, B|ˆn1, ˆn2, λ) = P(A|ˆn1, λ) P(B|ˆn2, λ).
(8.48)
From here, it turns out to be a straightforward mathematical exercise to derive the
CHSH inequality. Recall ﬁrst that the correlation coefﬁcient C(ˆn1, ˆn2) is deﬁned as
the expected value of the product of the outcomes A and B. This is simply the sum
(over all four possible joint outcomes for A and B) of the product of the outcomes,
weighted by the probability of that particular joint outcome. Notice also that, when we

8.6 (Bell’s) Locality Inequality Theorem
239
speak of the “expected value”, we mean: over a run of many particle pairs in which,
for all we know, the exact state λ of the particle pair may vary from run to run. So
we should also, for each possible joint outcome, average over the possible states
λ that might have been produced by the source. (Let’s assume, for deﬁniteness but
without loss of generality, that a continuously inﬁnite spectrum of different possible
λs are possible, with probability density ρ(λ).) Our expression for the correlation
coefﬁcient then looks like:
C(ˆn1, ˆn2) =
	 
A,B
A · B · P(A, B|ˆn1, ˆn2, λ) ρ(λ) dλ
=
	 
A,B
A · B · P(A|ˆn1, λ) · P(B|ˆn2, λ) ρ(λ) dλ
=
	 
A
A · P(A|ˆn1 λ)
 
B
B · P(B|ˆn2, λ)

ρ(λ) dλ
=
	
¯A(ˆn1, λ) ¯B(ˆn2, λ) ρ(λ) dλ
(8.49)
where, in the ﬁrst step, we have used the factorized expression for the joint probability
(which follows from local causality) and in the last step we have deﬁned
¯A(ˆn1, λ) =

A
A · P(A|ˆn1, λ)
(8.50)
as the average value of A (and similarly for B). Since the only two possible outcomes
for A are +1 and −1, it is obvious that this average value must be between −1 and
+1, i.e.,
 ¯A(ˆn1, λ)
 ≤1
(8.51)
and similarly
 ¯B(ˆn2, λ)
 ≤1.
(8.52)
Now let us consider the combinations of correlation coefﬁcients that appear in the
CHSH inequality. To begin with,
C(ˆa, ˆb) −C(ˆa, ˆc) =
	
¯A(ˆa, λ)

¯B(ˆb, λ) −¯B(ˆc, λ)

ρ(λ) dλ
(8.53)
so that
C(ˆa, ˆb) −C(ˆa, ˆc)
 ≤
	  ¯B(ˆb, λ) −¯B(ˆc, λ)
 ρ(λ) dλ
(8.54)
since
 ¯A(ˆa, λ)
 ≤1.

240
8
Bell’s Theorem
In a similar way, we have that
C(ˆa′, ˆb) + C(ˆa′, ˆc)
 ≤
	  ¯B(ˆb, λ) + ¯B(ˆc, λ)
 ρ(λ) dλ.
(8.55)
Adding the last two equations, noting that |x −y| + |x + y| is either 2x, or −2x,
or 2y, or −2y, and is hence deﬁnitely less than or equal to 2 as long as |x| ≤1 and
|y| ≤1, and using the fact that

ρ(λ)dλ = 1, we arrive at the CHSH inequality:
C(ˆa, ˆb) −C(ˆa, ˆc)
 +
C(ˆa′, ˆb) + C(ˆa′, ˆc)
 ≤2.
(8.56)
And so, any theory that respects Bell’s “local causality” condition must make
predictionsforthecorrelationsinthiskindofexperimentwhichrespecttheinequality.
But since the actual experimental data shows a clear violation of the inequality, it
follows that all theories which respect Bell’s “local causality” condition are wrong.
The true theory, whatever that is exactly, must violate “local causality”. But that is
just a complicated way of saying that Nature itself violates local causality, i.e., the
faster-than-light causal inﬂuences (which “local causality” prohibits) really exist in
the world.
That, as we have already acknowledged, is profound and deeply troubling. And
this way of arriving at the conclusion should make much clearer that one cannot
escape it simply, for example, by upholding the orthodox completeness doctrine
and rejecting hidden variables (or determinism or “realism”). This should help you
appreciate why, when Bell referred to his own theorem, he (modestly) called it the
“locality inequality theorem” [1].
Projects:

Sect.8.2.
8.2 Use the table from Sect.8.2 to show that, indeed, Eqs.(8.32) and (8.33) are
equivalent.
8.3 Work through and understand all the detailed steps in the derivation, from

the text).
8.4 InSect.8.3,wediscussedtheneedtoassumethatthenumbers Fi (characterizing
thefractionof particlepairs that areof eachpossibletype) areindependent of the
axes along which the particle spins will be measured. (This assumption in the
derivation of the inequality is then rendered applicable in an ideal experimental
test of the inequality by letting the measurement axes be chosen randomly and
only after the particle pairs have been emitted.) A similar assumption is made
in the derivation of the CHSH inequality in Sect.8.6, but the terminology is
a little different and the assumption was not highlighted in the text. Explain,
in the terminology of Sect.8.6, what this assumption is, and point out the ﬁrst
equation in the derivation which would be invalid without this assumption.

8.10 Your friend is a sociologist doing her senior thesis on the political opinions of
twins. She invites pairs of twins to show up and earn $20 by participating in her
study. When a pair arrives, she sends the older twin into the room on the left
with her assistant, Alice, and sends the younger twin into the room on the right
with her other assistant, Bob. The rooms are extremely well soundproofed and
the doors are tightly locked after each subject enters his/her room. After the
doors are locked, the assistant (Alice or Bob) rolls a 3-sided die to randomly
choose one of three pre-determined yes/no questions to ask the subjects. (What
the questions are don’t matter here, but you could imagine they are something
like: Q1 is “Should we raise the minimum wage?”, Q2 is “Should the fed
raise interest rates?”, and Q3 is “Should Roe-vs-Wade be overturned?”) The
assistants record the subjects’ answers, and the whole process is repeated for
several hundred pairs of subjects. Afterwards, your friend collects and analyzes
all of the data and notices the following:
• When both twins happen to be asked the same question, they always answer
the same way (either both “yes” or both “no”).
• When the older twin is asked Q1 and the younger twin is asked Q2, the
answers are (respectively) “yes” and “no” 20% of the time.
• When the older twin is asked Q2 and the younger twin is asked Q3, the
answers are (respectively) “yes” and “no” 15% of the time.
• When the older twin is asked Q1 and the younger twin is asked Q3, the
answers are (respectively) “yes” and “no” 40% of the time.
What should you advise your friend to conclude?
8.11 Interview some physicists to ﬁnd out what they think Bell’s Theorem is and
proves. If they say that Bell’s theorem proves you can’t have a determinis-
tic/hidden variables theory, you might consider following up by asking them
how they reconcile this with the existence of the de Broglie - Bohm pilot-wave
theory. You might also consider asking them if they think that ordinary QM
(without any hidden variables) is a local theory and, if so, how they recon-

242

Bell’s Theorem
cile this with the perfect EPR correlations (i.e., ask them exactly how, in their
understanding, ordinary QM explains these correlations in a local way).
8.12 Recall the assumption, made in the derivation of Bell inequalities, that, in the
notation of Sect.8.6, the probability distribution ρ(λ) is independent of the
settings ˆn1 and ˆn2. We have discussed how an ideal experimental test involves
randomly choosing the settings “at the last second” in order to ensure that this
condition is satisﬁed, the idea being that then there is no way for the particle
source to have “known” about the settings – they didn’t even exist yet when the
source emitted the particles! But this is a little too quick. Sometimes people
imagine that the settings could actually be determined, directly, by some kind
of “free will choices” made at the last second by Alice and Bob. And depending
on whether one believes in, and/or how one understands, “free will”, that might
indeed ensure that ρ(λ) is independent of the settings. But nobody has ever
performed an experiment like that; the real experiments use various sorts of
random-number generators to determine the settings. But (again, depending on
what sort of random number generator is used, exactly, and perhaps depending
on whether one believes in “hidden variables”) the outputs of random number
generators are not actually random. In principle, the outputs are determined by
something, which was in turn determined by something else, and so on into the
past. Sketch a space-time diagram to make it clear how, at least in principle,
both the settings ˆn1 and ˆn2 and the state λ of the particle pair could all be
inﬂuenced/determined by something in their overlapping past light cones, and
could therefore be correlated (such that ρ(λ) is different for different values of
ˆn1 and ˆn2) without any funny-business like non-locality or backwards-in-time
causation. How seriously do you think this possibility should be taken? It may
be helpful to think about the extent to which a similar independence assumption
is needed in other scientiﬁc experiments that have nothing to do with quantum
mechanics, e.g., a controlled drug trial in which patients are randomly assigned
to receive either the drug or a placebo.3
8.13 Read one (or more!) of the three recent experimental papers reporting improved
tests of Bell’s inequalities, Refs. [7–9]. There are at least two interesting things
to pay attention to in these papers. First, how do their experiments work and
how do they represent improvements over the earlier experiments of Aspect (et
al.) and Weihs (et al.)? And second, how do the authors talk about what their
experiments show? That is, do they regard them as refuting hidden variables,
or proving non-locality, or what exactly?
3Just to give you a sense of the spectrum of views which exist on this issue, the assumption – that
ρ(λ) is independent of the settings ˆn1 and ˆn2 – has been called the “no conspiracies” assumption,
with the implication that you’d have to be a crazy conspiracy theorist to take it seriously; on the
other hand, the Nobel Prize winning particle physicist Gerard ’t Hooft, among others, thinks that
relativity and quantum theory can and should be reconciled by denying that this assumption applies
to the real experiments.

Chapter 9
The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
Commenting on the quantum measurement problem as illustrated by Schrödinger’s
infamous cat, Bell remarked: “Either the wavefunction, as given by the Schrödinger
equation, is not everything, or it is not right [1].” We have seen, in Chap.7, how
the measurement problem can be avoided if the wave function is not everything: by
supplementing the wave function with additional objects (like the always-deﬁnite
positions of particles in the pilot-wave theory) we can have a theory which actually
predicts that deﬁnite things should happen, without anything like ad hoc and ill-
deﬁned exceptions to the usual dynamical rules.
In this chapter, we explore the other possibility mentioned by Bell – that the wave-
function, as given by the Schrödinger equation, isn’t right. Recall that the essence
of the measurement problem was that, according to Schrödinger’s equation, interac-
tions between (for example) a particle and a measuring apparatus do not typically
result in the measuring apparatus pointer having a deﬁnite post-interaction position.
Instead, the measuring apparatus gets infected with whatever quantum superposition
was present in the initial state of the particle being measured. In ordinary quantum
mechanics, this seemingly problematic result is already avoided in the way suggested
by Bell – the “collapse postulate” is precisely a claim that the wave function as given
by Schrödinger’s equation isn’t right. In particular, when a measurement occurs, the
wave function ceases to evolve according to Schrödinger’s equation, and (momentar-
ily) does something entirely different instead. This avoids the seemingly problematic
idea of superpositions of macroscopically distinct situations, but at a heavy price: it
seems unbelievable that there is a fundamental distinction between “measurement”
and “non-measurement” processes. Somehow, the true fundamental theory should
treat all processes in a consistent, uniform fashion.
The “spontaneous collapse” theory is, at root, an attempt to remove this troubling
dualism by positing, for the wave function, a single, universally-applicable dynam-
ical evolution law which will somehow accomplish, in a single stroke, the two jobs
done respectively by the Schrödinger equation and the collapse postulate in ordinary
QM. The idea, more speciﬁcally, is to modify Schrödinger’s equation with stochastic

non-linear terms which will have the effect of preserving the Schrödinger evolution
for microscopic systems (where we know it is correct) but also ensuring that macro-
scopic things like pointers (and cats!) end up in the sorts of deﬁnite, non-superposed
states we observe them to always end up in.
9.1
Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber
The main idea of the spontaneous collapse theory is sometimes traced back to a 1966
paper by David Bohm and Jeffrey Bub, which explores a type of hidden variable
theory rather unlike Bohm’s 1952 pilot-wave theory. In the pilot-wave theory, of
course, the additional variables (namely, the positions of the particles) are controlled
by the wave function, which thus plays a somewhat mysterious background role.
In the 1966 paper, by contrast, it is the hidden variables – here something like a
background ﬁeld – which inﬂuence the evolution of the wave function and give rise
to deviations from the normal Schrödinger-equation evolution thereof.
This motivated Philip Pearle and also, somewhat later, Nicolas Gisin – both of
whom were very concerned by the measurement problem of ordinary QM – to begin
exploring stochastic modiﬁcations of the usual Schrödinger equation. Some progress
was made toward the goal of reconciling wave function dynamics with the appearance
of deﬁnite outcomes, but no systematic method of achieving the desired ends was
identiﬁed, and several difﬁculties (including for example the apparent inevitability
of conﬂicts with relativity when deviations from the Schrödinger evolution were
contemplated) were brought into sharper focus.
A breakthrough appeared in 1986, when three Italian physicists (Ghirardi, Rim-
ini, and Weber – hereafter “GRW”) took fuller advantage of the fundamentality of
position: if you can get the positions of macroscopic things right, then you will auto-
matically get other properties right as well, since the outcomes of measurements of
other properties (such as energy, momentum, spin, etc.) are always registered in the
position of some macroscopic object (like our ubiquitous pointer) [2]. So whereas
the earlier proposals had struggled with the problem of deciding which basis to use in
narrowing the wave function (does one narrow in momentum space when a momen-
tum measurement is happening?), GRW proposed the simple and elegant idea that
wave functions should occasionally (randomly, spontaneously) localize exclusively
in position space.1
In the theory, it is as if, at randomly selected moments, some outside observer
makes a (somewhat rough) position measurement and thus collapses the particle’s

1Note that there is an interesting parallel here to the pilot-wave theory, which eludes the “no hidden
variables” theorems by letting non-position properties (such as momentum, energy, and spin) be
“contextual”. This difference, between the way position and other properties are treated by the
theory, does not prevent the theory from generating correct empirical predictions for measurements
of non-position properties since even the outcomes of momentum/energy/spin measurements are
registered, at the end of the day, in the position of some pointer.

rather than a perfectly sharp delta function). But of course the whole point of the
theory is to avoid the idea of some mysterious “outside observer” whose interventions
imply exceptions to the usual dynamical behavior... hence “as if”. According to GRW,
the occasional collapses or “localizations” of the wave function should be considered
as purely natural – part of the ordinary, universal way that wave functions evolve in
time.
In just a moment, we’ll talk through the technical details of these spontaneous
localizations, starting ﬁrst, in the present section, with the simple case of a single
particle (in 1-D for simplicity). Then in the following sections we will explain how
the theory describes multi-particle systems, including those that we would commonly
describe as involving “measurements”.
But ﬁrst, let me just acknowledge that the theory, as it will be explained, maybe
doesn’t seem to do a very good job of truly unifying the two different types of
wave-function time-evolution posited by ordinary QM. The GRW evolution will
amount to: wave functions just evolve according to Schrödinger’s equation most of
the time, except for these occasional random moments when they instead suffer a
spontaneous localization. The supposed uniﬁcation here perhaps feels a bit like taking
these two allegedly incompatible dynamical evolution laws, wrapping a bow around
both of them together, and saying “Voila!” Putting this point another way, it may feel
like there is somehow not much difference between the GRW theory and standard
textbook QM: whereas orthodox QM says “Wave-functions evolve according to
Schrödinger’s equation, except during measurements, when they instead collapse”
GRW says “Wave-functions evolve according to Schrödinger’s equation, except at
certain random moments, when they instead collapse.” Other than a minor change
in the words, is there really any difference?
It’s a fair question, in response to which two things might be said.
One is that while the GRW process does indeed have a somewhat implausibly
dualistic character, this can to at least some degree be eliminated. For example, mod-
els have been developed (especially by Pearle) in which, instead of abrupt intermittent
wave function collapses, one has gentler localizations that are occuring continuously
in time. The net effect (that is, something like the total amount of localization that
happens per unit time) is roughly the same, but – because the Schrödinger-type and
collapse-type evolutions are simultaneous and omnipresent – the dynamics feels a lit-
tle more natural, coherent, and plausible. These so-called “continuous spontaneous
localization” (CSL) models also solve some other technical issues with the GRW
process as we will explain it. So, to some degree, one can take our discussion of the
GRW process merely as a kind of pedagogical simpliﬁcation of an overall concept
which can perhaps be implemented somewhat more elegantly.
A second point, though, is that to some extent, no matter how you slice them
up, “spontaneous collapse” theories just are somewhat dualistic. They are, after all,
literally designed to unify the two dynamical postulates of ordinary QM. The duality,
then, is somehow a problem only if one is expecting something that is somehow
radically different from ordinary QM. But perhaps we should not expect that, and we
should instead view the spontaneous collapse idea simply as an attempt to replace the
“loose talk” (about “measurements” and “observers”) in ordinary QM, with sharp

mathematics. From this point of view, we should not regard the GRW theory so much
as an alternative to ordinary, textbook QM, but rather as something like “ordinary
QM v2.0”. In this vein, Bell said about the GRW theory: “I do think [the spontaneous
collapse theories have] a certain kind of goodness... in the sense that they are honest
attempts to replace the wooly words by real mathematical equations – equations
which you don’t have to talk away – equations which you simply calculate with and
take the results seriously [3].”
All right. With all of that as preamble, let’s ﬁnally jump into exploring in mathe-
matical detail how the GRW theory works.
So, as has been said, the theory posits that the wave function of a single particle
evolves according to Schrödinger’s equation
iℏ∂ψ(x, t)
∂t
= −ℏ2
2m
∂2ψ(x, t)

+ V (x, t)ψ(x, t)
(9.1)
most of the time. But the Schrödinger evolution is interrupted by occasional local-
izations. The Schrödinger-equation part of the evolution is already well-understood,
so we will focus our exposition on the localizations.
First, when do they happen? For a single particle, there is supposed to be a constant
probability per unit time, d P
dt = λ, for a spontaneous localization to occur. This will
give rise to a (Poisson-distributed) sequence of times t1, t2, t3, . . ., with an average
“waiting time” τ = tn+1−tn between the localizations given by τ = 1/λ. For reasons
that will be discussed as we proceed, GRW suggest that the constant λ should have
a value in the neighborhood of
λ ≈10−16 s−1
(9.2)
so that the average time between localizations is
τ = 1
λ ≈1016 s = 3 × 108 years.
(9.3)
That’s three hundred million years – a very long time! So, for a single particle,
the spontaneous localizations are quite rare. It may even appear that localizations
occuring at such a slow rate would be totally negligible. But, as we will see in
the next section, they will become quite important in the evolution of macroscopic
systems containing a large number of particles. Before turning to that, though, let’s
understand in more precise detail what exactly happens at one of these intermittent
localization events.
Consider the Gaussian function
gr(x) =
1
(2πσ2)1/4 e−(x−r)2/4σ2
(9.4)
which has a half-width of about σ, is centered at the point x = r, and is normalized
in the following sense:

9.1 Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber
249

gr(x)

σ
Fig. 9.1 The localization of a wave function in the GRW theory basically consists of its being
multiplied by the Gaussian function gr(x) shown here
 ∞
−∞
|gr(x)|2 dx = 1.
(9.5)
(Since gr(x) is real-valued, the absolute value bars here are unnecessary but, of
course, totally harmless.) The function gr(x) is shown in Fig.9.1. Note that, again
for reasons that will emerge as our presentation proceeds, the value of the constant
σ is postulated by GRW to have a value in the neighborhood of
σ ≈10−7 m.
(9.6)
It is important that this is fairly small on the macroscopic scale, but fairly large
compared to, for example, the size of an atom.
The basic idea is then that, during an episode of “spontaneous localization”, the
wave function gets suddenly multiplied by gr(x). Suppose one of the localizations
happens at time t. Then the wave function ψ(x, t+) just after time t is given by
ψ(x, t+) ∼gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
(9.7)
where ψ(x, t−) is what the wave function was right before time t. That is the basic
idea, but there are a couple of mathematical details to iron out.
First of all, I wrote “∼” rather than “=” just above because the product on the
right hand side will not generally be a properly normalized wave function. This is
easy enough to ﬁx by writing instead
ψ(x, t+) = gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
N(r)
(9.8)
where the re-normalization factor N(r) given by
N(r)2 =
 gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
2 dx
(9.9)

250
9
The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
ensures that ψ(x, t+) is properly normalized:
 ψ(x, t+)
2 dx =
1
N(r)2
 gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
2 dx = 1.
(9.10)
The second mathematical detail addresses the question: what is the value of r,
i.e., what point does the wave function get localized around? The answer is that r is
random, with a probability distribution
P(r) = N(r)2 =
 gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
2 dx.
(9.11)
This says, basically, that the wave function is most likely to localize around some
point x = r where the wave function modulus is large to begin with. In a little more
detail, it says that the probability for localization at the point x = r is proportional
to what would usually be regarded as the total probability associated with the new
(but not yet normalized) localized state, if the localization did occur at x = r. (You
are invited to prove that P(r) as deﬁned here really is a valid probability distribution
in the Projects.)
Let’s work through a couple of simple examples to clarify the idea.
To begin with, suppose the wave function is initially extremely spread out so that
it has (say, over some region of width L ≫σ) a constant value:
ψ(x, t−) =
1
√
L
.
(9.12)
(Theactualvalueheredoesn’tmattermuchforourpurposes,butwemightaswelltake
the wave function to be properly normalized.) Now, at time t, let’s say a spontaneous
localization happens to occur. It is (approximately) equally likely to occur at any
point r where the wave function ψ(x, t−) has support, since
P(r) = N(r)2 =
 gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
2 dx ≈

1/L where ψ(x, t−) = 1/
√
L
0
where ψ(x, t−) = 0
.
(9.13)
The reason for the “≈” is that technically, at the edges of the width-L region where
the wave function is initially non-zero, P(r) will be a little smaller than 1/L, and
similarly it’ll be a little bigger than zero just outside that region where ψ(x, t−) = 0.
That is, P(r) will have a smooth transition at the edges, as shown in the lower graph
of Fig.9.2. But still, leaving aside the edge effects, we can say that the localization
is equally likely to occur at any point in the width-L region where the wave function
was nonzero.
And of course, after the localization, the multiplication of the initially-constant
wave function by the Gaussian gr(x) produces a Gaussian wave function, centered at
the randomly-selected point r. The transition from ψ(x, t−) to ψ(x, t+) is sketched
in the upper graph of Fig.9.2.

Fig. 9.2 If the wave function ψ(x, t−) is roughly constant over some region, a spontaneous localiza-
tion will narrow it down to a Gaussian, of width σ, centered at some point r which is (approximately)
equally likely to be anywhere in the region where ψ(x, t−) was nonzero
OK, so, if the wave function is initially very spread out compared to the length
scale σ, a spontaneous localization does exactly what is advertised – it localizes the
wave function around some new, randomly selected point where the wave function
was originally big.
As a second example, let’s take the opposite limit, where the wave function is
already, initially, very narrowly peaked. It is convenient to take the extreme limiting
case of a position eigenstate, i.e., a wave function which is a Dirac delta function:
ψ(x, t−) ∼δ(x −a).
(9.14)
Of course, this is not a properly normalized state, and (while not really making any
difference at the end of the day), that will be slightly annoying as we try to ﬁgure
out what our general formulas imply for things like the probability distribution P(r).
With apologies to any mathematicians who are reading, we can elude these problems
in a simple way by writing
ψ(x, t−) =
1
√δ(0) δ(x −a).
(9.15)
Now suppose a spontaneous localization happens. This means the wave function will
be multiplied by a Gaussian centered at some random point r. What is the probability
distribution for this point? Well,
P(r) = N(r)2 =

2πσ2 e−(r−a)2/2σ2 = ga(r)2. (9.16)

252

The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
That is, P(r) is a Gaussian function, of width σ, centered at the same point x = a
where the wave function is initially concentrated. That makes sense.
So some pointr (within about σ either way from x = a) is randomly chosen. What
does the wave function look like after multiplication by gr(x) and re-normalization?
Well,
ψ(x, t+) = gr(x)ψ(x, t−)
N(r)
= gr(x)
N(r)
δ(x −a)
√δ(0)
= gr(a)
N(r)
δ(x −a)
√δ(0)
= ψ(x, t−)
(9.17)
since, as we just showed, N(r) = gr(a). In this case as shown in Fig.9.3, the
spontaneous localization actually doesn’t change the wave function at all! (And
note in particular that the wave function stays the same no matter which value of r
was selected.) This actually makes sense: a δ-function wave function is already as
localized as it is possible for a wave function to be, so the spontaneous localization
doesn’t change it at all.
Another interesting case to consider is an initially Gaussian wave function of
width w0. It turns out that, for w0 ≫σ, the width after the localization decreases to
about σ, whereas if w0 ≪σ, the width is basically unaffected by the “localization”.
That is, this case smoothly interpolates between the two extremes embodied in our
two examples. Rather than pursue that here, though, I’ll let you work it out in the
Projects.

Fig. 9.3 If the wave function ψ(x, t−) is a δ-function (centered at x = a), then the probability
distribution P(r) is a width-σ Gaussian centered at x = a. But that turns out to be irrelevant
because, no matter what value of r is chosen, the wave function is unaffected by the spontaneous
localization: ψ(x, t−) = ψ(x, t+)

9.1 Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber
253
For a third and ﬁnal example here, let’s consider an “Einstein’s boxes” kind of
situation in which a particle is in a superposition of two relatively-sharply-deﬁned
positions. Concretely, suppose that
ψ(x, t−) =
1
√
2
δ(x + a)
√δ(0)
+ δ(x −a)
√δ(0)

(9.18)
so that the particle is in a 50/50 superposition of “being at x = −a” and “being at
x = +a”. And let us assume that the two possible positions here are very distant,
i.e., a ≫σ.
The spontaneous localization process in this example is illustrated in Fig.9.4. The
probability distribution P(r = x) for where the localization will be centered consists
of two symmetric Gaussian functions centered at x = +a and x = −a respectively.
Suppose that, by chance, r ≈+a. Then we have that

Fig. 9.4 If the wave function ψ(x, t−) is a superposition of two δ-functions, separated by a distance
much larger than σ, the localization promotes one of the δ-functions while greatly suppressing the
size of the other. For all practical purposes, the post-localization wave function is just one or
the other of the previously-superposed spikes, so the localization has the effect of erasing spatial
superpositions over a length scale greater than σ. Note that, as shown in the P(r = x) graph below,
the localization is equally likely to promote the x = a or the x = −a term. What is shown above
is, obviously, the case in which r ≈+a so that ψ(x, t+) is basically δ(x −a) – but with just a tiny
bit of δ(x + a) remaining as well

254

The post-collapse wave function is then given by

= δ(x −a)
√δ(0)
(9.21)
where we have again thrown out a term that is small by a factor like e−2a2/σ2 which
is extremely small if a ≫σ.
So basically, if r ≈+a, the localization completely annihilates the delta function
spike at x = −a and leaves only a (re-normalized) spike at x = +a. (Of course, it
was equally probable that instead we would have had r = −a in which case the fates
of the two spikes would have been reversed.) A particle which is in a superposition
of two distinct locations (separated by a distance greater than σ) will not remain in
that superposition forever; instead, according to GRW, the particle will eventually
be located deﬁnitely on the left or deﬁnitely on the right – and this transition will
happen spontaneously, without the need of anything like an external intervention or
observation.
It might occur to you to worry that this spontaneous localization could destroy the
interference that is observed in, for example, the two-slit experiment: if the two slits
areseparatedbyadistancegreaterthanσ ≈10−7 m–andintypicaldemonstrationsof
interference, they are! – then the wave function of a particle which happens to suffer a
spontaneous localization while it is traversing the 2-slit apparatus would not form an
interference pattern at the screen, but would instead form something like a single-slit
diffraction pattern. Does this mean that the GRW theory contradicts the observation
of interference? No, for recall that, according to the theory, an individual particle
only suffers a spontaneous localization every 300 million years or so. So unless
you have a lot of time on your hands and send particles through the apparatus very
slowly, you would never expect to see deviations from the usual quantum mechanical
predictions in this kind of situation. Virtually all of the particles sent through would
remain uncollapsed during the entire duration of their journey from source to screen.
9.2
Multiple Particle Systems and Measurement
As hinted at before, the incredible slowness/rarity of the GRW localizations might
make one think that the localizations can just be completely ignored and will play
no role whatever in the theory’s predictions. But that is only true as long as we are
thinking of individual particles. To understand the role of the localizations in the

9.2 Multiple Particle Systems and Measurement
255
GRW theory’s solution to the measurement problem, we therefore need to see how
the theory describes multi-particle systems.
The generalization of the theory to many-particle systems is pretty straightfor-
ward. In a nutshell, the idea is just that each individual particle suffers spontaneous
localizations in the same way that we described in the previous section. How things
play out then depends importantly on whether or not there is entanglement. Let’s
begin by discussing the simpler case in which there is no entanglement.
Consider, then, a two-particle system which, at the moment t−just before a spon-
taneous localization occurs, is in the (non-entangled, i.e., factorizable) quantum state
(x1, x2, t−) = ψ(x1, t−)φ(x2, t−).
(9.22)
In a multi-particle situation like this, it is supposed to be irreducibly random which
particle suffers the ﬁrst localization (in addition to being irreducibly random exactly
when and where that localization occurs). But, for deﬁniteness, suppose that particle
2 suffers a localization at time t. Then, just as in the previous section, we have
(x1, x2, t+) = gr(x2)(x1, x2, t−)
N(r)
(9.23)
where, in the obvious generalization of what we saw previously,
N(r)2 =
 gr(x2)(x1, x2, t−)
2 dx1 dx2.
(9.24)
And note that, also just as before, the probability density for the localization to be
centered at the point r is P(r) = N(r)2.
Plugging in the non-entangled two-particle state, Eq. (9.22), we see that
(x1, x2, t+) = ψ(x1, t−)gr(x2)φ(x2, t−)
N(r)
.
(9.25)
The important point here is that when the overall quantum state involves no entan-
glement, an individual spontaneous localization only affects the particular particle
that is “hit” by it. The overall state remains an unentangled product state, and the
factors representing the wave functions of the other particles (in our example here,
particle 1) are in no way affected by the localization.
But let us now turn to the more interesting case where there is entanglement
between the two particles. Take, for simplicity, the same sort of example we con-
sidered in the previous section, in which a particle is located either at x = +a or at
x = −a, but suppose now there are two particles in a superposition of “both particles

256
9
The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
are at x = +a” and “both particles are at x = −a”. Suppose in particular that, at a
time t−just before one of the particles happens to suffer a spontaneous localization,
the two-particle wave function is
(x1, x2, t−) ∼
1
√
2
[δ(x1 −a)δ(x2 −a) + δ(x1 + a)δ(x2 + a)] .
(9.26)
Now, what happens to this wave function if one of the particles suffers a spontaneous
localization? We cannot, as before, just say that “the wave function of one of the
particles gets localized, while that of the other is unaffected”... For an entangled
state like this the particles cannot even be said to possess their own individual wave
functions! So let’s just let the math tell us what happens, supposing, again arbitrarily,
that it is particle 2 which nominally suffers the localization:
(x1, x2, t+) = gr(x2)(x1, x2, t−)
N(r)
(9.27)
where r is random, with probability distribution N(r)2. Here, just as before, the
deﬁnition of N(r) is
N(r)2 =
 gr(x2)(x1, x2, t−)
2 dx1 dx2.
(9.28)
This will be large in a small (size-σ) neighborhood around r = +a as well as a
small neighborhood around r = −a. That is, the spatial probability distribution for
the center of the localization will look exactly like it did in the last example of the
previous section.
Supposethat,forthisparticularlocalization,ithappensthatr ≈+a.Then(leaving
out the uninteresting re-normalization factor) the two-particle wave function after the
localization will look like
(x1, x2, t+) ∼ga(x2)(x1, x2, t−)
= ga(x2) 1
√
2
[δ(x1 −a)δ(x2 −a) + δ(x2 + a)δ(x2 + a)]

2
[δ(x1 −a)δ(x2 −a)ga(x2) + δ(x1 + a)δ(x2 + a)ga(x2)]
=
1
√
2
[δ(x1 −a)δ(x2 −a)ga(a) + δ(x1 + a)δ(x2 + a)ga(−a)]
(9.29)
Now here is the crucial point. The factor ga(a) (in the ﬁrst term in the square brack-
ets) is “big” – it is just the value of g at exactly the place where g peaks. But the
factor ga(−a) (in the second term in the square brackets) is vanishingly small, if
the separation (2a) between the two places the particles might have been is large

Fig. 9.5 The left graph is a conﬁguration space map of the two-particle wave function (x1, x2)
for two particles in a superposition of “both particles on the left” and “both particles on the right”.
The right graph is the same map, after a single spontaneous localization. Despite nominally acting
on just one of the two particles, the spontaneous localization gives rise to a wave function which
has both particles localized together
compared to the width σ of the localization function g. So, to an excellent approx-
imation, we have that, after the spontaneously localization (which, remember, was
nominally associated with just one of the two entangled particles)
(x1, x2, t+) = δ(x1 −a)δ(x2 −a)
(9.30)
which is of course a state in which both particles are deﬁnitely located at x = a.
This process is illustrated in Fig.9.5.
That was of course just one of several possibilities. We assumed arbitrarily that
particle2happenstosuffertheﬁrstspontaneouslocalization,andthatthislocalization
happens to be centered around r = +a. If you think through it, though, it should
be clear that the ﬁnal state would have been exactly the same had it been instead
particle 1 that suffered a collapse centered near r = +a. So it doesn’t actually matter
which particle gets “hit” – either one getting localized localizes both because their
positions started out in the special entangled state. And it should also be clear that,
if either particle instead suffered a localization centered near x = −a, then both
particles would have ended up deﬁnitely localized at x = −a.
Now we are ﬁnally in a position to understand how this spontaneous collapse
theory solves the measurement problem. Suppose that, instead of just two particles
being in an entangled state that binds their positions together (even as they remain in
a superposition of, say, “all being on the left” or “all being on the right”) it is instead
some macroscopically-large number, like N ≈1023 particles whose positions are so
bound. That is, suppose the initial state is something like
(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t−)
∼

[δ(x1 −a)δ(x2 −a) · · · δ(xN −a) + δ(x1 + a)δ(x2 + a) · · · δ(xN + a)] .
(9.31)

The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
Then we can see that, as soon as any one of the N particles suffers a spontaneous
localization, the entire set of particles will localize along the following lines:
(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t+) ∼δ(x1 −r)δ(x2 −r) · · · δ(xN −r)
(9.32)
with r = +a or r = −a with 50/50 probability. Everything is just the same as
before, with one important exception. With just one particle, we would typically
need to wait around τ = 300 million years for the particle to spontaneously localize.
For two particles, we would typically need to wait around τ/2 ≈150 million years.
But for N ≈1023 particles, we would typically need to wait τ/N ≈30 nanoseconds.
That is, because of the enormous number of individual particles comprising anything
remotely macroscopic, a macroscopic object (like, say, a pointer or a cat) will suffer a
constant barrage of spontaneous localizations (millions or billions or trillions of them
per second), which will for all practical purposes prevent it from ever getting into the
kind of macroscopic superposition state which so worried Einstein and Schrödinger.
As Bell expressed this point: “Quite generally any embarrassing macroscopic ambi-
guity in the usual theory is only momentary in the GRW theory. The cat is not both
dead and alive for more than a split second [1].”
Let us illustrate this one last time with our standard example of a quantum mea-
surement process: a single “particle in a box” which begins in a superposition of
several different energy eigenstates, but which is then coupled to an energy mea-
suring device, represented schematically as a pointer whose position moves by an
amount proportional to the energy of the particle. As should be familiar from earlier
treatments, if the coupling begins at t = 0, the Schrödinger equation dictates that
the wave function at time t will be given by
(x, y, t) =

i
ciψi(x, t)φ0(y −λEit)
(9.33)
where the ψi are the energy eigenfunctions (with corresponding energy eigenvalues
Ei) for the particle-in-a-box and φ0 is a narrow Gaussian wave packet representing
the position of the center of mass of the (roughly 1023) particles composing the
pointer.
The particle-in-a-box is just a single particle, so the probability that it will happen
to suffer a spontaneous localization during the time of the experiment is negligible.
The pointer, on the other hand, being macroscopic, will suffer repeated localizations.
If, however, the width of the wave packet φ0 describing its center-of-mass location
is small compared to σ, these localizations will have essentially no effect on the
overall wave function for early times during which the individual wave packets –
corresponding to terms with different values of i in Eq.(9.33) – remain overlapping
in conﬁguration space.
However, as soon as the different terms begin to fail to overlap, such that the
spacing between them is of order σ, the situation will be just like that discussed
earlier in this section: because all 1023 particles composing the pointer are bound
together (by the usual sorts of intra- and inter-atomic forces) a single spontaneous

whose axes are the position x of the particle-in-a-box and the position y of the center-of-mass of
the pointer) for our toy measurement example. As soon as the individual terms in the superposition
(which are separating along the y-direction of conﬁguration space) have separation of order σ,
the superposition collapses to just one term, randomly selected from all the possibilities, with
probability |ci|2. Thus, before there would be time for anybody to notice or worry about a troubling
macroscopic superposition, the overall wave function describes the pointer as having a well-deﬁned
center-of-mass position (here, arbitrarily, y ≈λE2t) and the particle-in-a-box as having the correct,
associated energy E2
localization of any of the particles will localize all of them, i.e., will localize the
entire macroscopic pointer, to just one of the terms. The others will, for all practical
purposes, disappear. This is illustrated in Fig.9.6.
Notice, in particular, that although the spontaneous localizations exclusively local-
ize the particles in position space, the particle-in-a-box (whose energy is being mea-
sured in this example) ends up in a state of deﬁnite energy, and, indeed, the partic-
ular state corresponding to the ﬁnal position of the pointer on the energy-measuring
device. Thus, no special/additional/contradictory prescription is required to cause
sub-system wave functions to collapse (in the way that ordinary QM says they do)
when some arbitrary measurement is performed on them. The measurement outcome
being displayed in the macroscopic spatial conﬁguration of some aspect of the mea-
suring device (here, the pointer, but one could just as well think of the distribution
of ink droplets on a computer printout, or the distribution of photons emitted from
a computer screen, for example) is perfectly sufﬁcient in general. This should help
clarify the earlier comments about the importance of recognizing the fundamentality
of position.

Ontology, Locality, and Relativity
As we have explained it so far, the GRW theory describes the world in terms of a wave
function. Because the collapse/localization mechanism is built into the dynamical
evolution law for the wave function, the theory has no need to follow orthodox QM

The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
in postulating a separately-existing macroscopic world and associated exceptions
to the usual dynamical laws. That is, by providing a uniform description of the
world that avoids (noticeable) macroscopic superpositions, the GRW theory avoids
the measurement problem that plagues ordinary QM. But what about the other two
problems associated with standard QM that we reviewed in earlier chapters?
We begin with the ontology problem. The wave function for an N-particle system
(where, for GRW, ultimately N is the total number of particles in the entire universe)
is something like a ﬁeld on 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space. This does not, in any
obvious or straightforward way, attribute deﬁnite properties to particular locations
in regular, 3-dimensional physical space. Since the ultimate goal must be to provide
a coherent description and explanation of the observable 3-dimensional physical
world, it is clear that more needs to be said about what, according to the theory, the
physical world is made of, and how it relates to the universal wave function whose
evolution we have already discussed.
Two possibilities have gained traction in the literature. The ﬁrst is, interest-
ingly, just the early idea of Schrödinger that we discussed in Chap.4. Recall that
Schrödinger’s idea was that the wave function (on conﬁguration space) could be
used to deﬁne (for example) a mass density associated with each individual particle,
according to
ρi(x, t) = mi

|(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t)|2 δ(xi −x) dx1 dx2 · · · dxN.
(9.34)
The total mass density could then be written
ρ(x, t) =

i
ρi(x, t)
(9.35)
and the original hope was that this ﬁeld ρ(x, t) would contain, at least at an appropri-
ately coarse-grained level, an image of the familiar macroscopic world of everyday
perception, including things like pointers with deﬁnite positions and unambiguously
alive or dead cats.
Schrödinger himself gave up this interpretation of the wave function (as repre-
senting a continuous matter density in physical space) because it simply did not work
the way he had hoped for. If the wave function obeys Schrödinger’s equation all of
the time, then the mass ﬁeld ρ(⃗x, t) inherits (or one might say, makes ontologically
clear) whatever problematic superpositions arose in the wave function itself. For
example, in the Schrödinger’s cat kind of situation, the mass ﬁeld would not contain
just a living cat or just a dead cat, but both – superimposed on top of one another,
so to speak. If one imagines extrapolating to a description of the entire world, with
frequent splittings of the universal wave function into different “branches” each of
which corresponds to some more or less deﬁnite macroscopic situation, all of these
different “possibilities” would be superimposed in  and hence ρ(⃗x, t) would be,
for lack of a better term, a complete and utter mess. The ρ generated by the theory,

9.3 Ontology, Locality, and Relativity
261
that is, simply wouldn’t look anything like what we know the world is supposed to
look like. So the theory seems clearly wrong.
But by altering the rules of wave-function evolution, the GRW dynamics avoids
precisely this sort of trouble. That is, if the wave function of the universe evolves,
not according to Schrödinger’s equation, but instead according to the GRW process,
the mass density ﬁeld ρ(⃗x, t) associated with the wave function will correspond
to just one of the sensible macroscopic possibilities. (Or at least, any appreciable
non-sensible macroscopic blurriness will not last for more than a split second.) The
three dimensional world, consisting of a mass ﬁeld ρ(⃗x, t) produced by a universal
wave function obeying the GRW dynamics, that is, will look right. There will be
tables and chairs and trees and planets with adequately-sharp shapes, structures, and
trajectories; cats will be unambiguously alive or dead; and so on.
So that is one possible way of understanding the ontology of the physical world
according to this theory. In the literature, this has come to be called “GRWm”,
meaning: the universal wave function evolves according to the GRW dynamics, and
the ontology is understood as a mass density ﬁeld.
The other possible way was suggested by Bell:
There is nothing in this theory but the wavefunction. It is in the wavefunction that we must
ﬁnd an image of the physical world, and in particular of the arrangement of things in ordinary
three-dimensional space. But the wavefunction as a whole lives in a much bigger space, of
3N-dimensions. It makes no sense to ask for the amplitude or phase or whatever of the
wavefunction at a point in ordinary space. It has neither amplitude nor phase nor anything
else until a multitude of points in ordinary three-dimensional space are speciﬁed. However,
the GRW jumps (which are part of the wavefunction, not something else) are well localized
in ordinary space. Indeed each is centered on a particular spacetime point [⃗x, t]. So we can
propose these events as the basis of the ‘local beables’ [Bell’s term for the physical space
ontology] of the theory. These are the mathematical counterparts in the theory to real events
at deﬁnite places and times in the real world.... A piece of matter then is a galaxy of such
events [1].
The idea, then, is that each spontaneous localization, which happens at a particular
time and is centered at a particular location in 3D space, produces a kind of “matter
point” at that location in space-time. These “matter points” have, in the subsequent
literature, come to be called “ﬂashes”, and so this version of GRW has come to be
called “GRWf”.
It is helpful to visualize the two options here, so in Fig.9.7. I have sketched,
on spacetime diagrams, the story of what is going on with the pointer in our toy
measurement example, according to GRWm and GRWf.
With two deﬁnite proposals for understanding the ontology of the GRW theory,
we are in a position to ask: does the theory (in either version) respect the idea of rel-
ativistic locality, i.e., no (spooky, faster-than-light) action at a distance? The answer,
simply and unambiguously, is: no. GRW (with either of the proposed ontologies)
is a non-local theory. This, of course, is not surprising given that we know, from
Bell’s theorem (Chap.8), that any theory which agrees with the quantum mechanical
predictions will have to be non-local. (But see Chap.10!) Still, it is worthwhile to
understand in more detail how the non-locality appears.

Fig. 9.7 The panel on the left shows the mass density ﬁeld ρ(y, t) associated with all the particles
composing the pointer, for the familiar toy measurement example in which the energy of a particle-
in-a-box is measured and the outcome, E2, is indicated by the position of a pointer. Here “the
pointer” consists of a lump of nonzero mass density that begins near y = 0 and then starts moving
to the right at a certain well-deﬁned rate just after the measurement interaction begins at t = 0. The
slight “bulge” around t = 0 is meant to suggest that, as the individual terms in the wave function
begin to separate, there is a brief period of time in which ρ(y, t) includes several superimposed
possibilities. But after a tiny fraction of a second, a spontaneous localization picks just one of the
possibilities, the rest disappear, and ρ(y, t) contains just the one realized possibility. The right panel
shows the same situation, but for the ﬂash ontology. The black dots represent the discrete, space-time
point ﬂashes and something like the overall motion of the pointer to the right, at a basically well-
deﬁned rate, can indeed be understood as “a galaxy of such events”. It is interesting to contemplate,
however, the fact that (in the same way that a real galaxy is mostly empty space), most of the
time the pointer is, according to GRWf, literally nothing. That is, for the overwhelming majority of
horizontal slices you could draw through the diagram (corresponding to particular moments), the
slice would intersect precisely zero of the dots/ﬂashes. The physical world, according to GRW, is
curiously sparse and pointillistic at the micro-scale... though it coarse-grains to produce a sensible
image of the familiar world at the macro-scale
It is easiest to see and understand in the case of GRWm, so let us begin there.
Consider a kind of double Einstein’s boxes situation, in which two particles are each
split between two pairs of half-boxes. In particular, suppose that Alice, a million
miles to the left, has a particle which is split between the half box in her left hand
(state ψ A
L ) and the half box in her right hand (state ψ A
R). And suppose that Bob, a
million miles to the right, has a second particle which is similarly split between the
half box in his left hand (state ψB
L ) and the half box in his right hand (state ψB
R).
And suppose that, by some prior careful arrangement, the two particles are in the
following entangled state:
ψ(x1, x2) =

(9.36)
Suppose also that Bob is prepared with a position measuring device (the center-of-
mass position of whose macroscopic pointer we denote y) which can interact with
the two half-boxes he’s holding and determine whether particle 2 is in the half box

Fig. 9.8 Space-time diagram showing the mass densities of the various objects described in the
text: the contents of the half-boxes in Alice’s left and right hands (L A and RA), the contents of the
half boxes in Bob’s left and right hands (L B and RB) and the pointer P on Bob’s position measuring
device. At t = 0 Bob initiates the measurement of the position of his particle; very shortly after
t = 0, a spontaneous localization in one of the (many!) pointer particles collapses the wave function
in such a way that subsequently, say: (i) the entire mass density associated with the pointer moves
unambiguously to the left, (ii) the mass density associated with Bob’s particle coalesces entirely
into L B (i.e., the density there doubles while the density in RB suddenly goes to zero), and (iii) the
mass density associated with Alice’s particle (millions of miles away!) also coalesces entirely into
L A. The change in the mass density distribution associated with Alice’s particle, as a consequence
of Bob’s measurement on his particle, is a clear-cut case of non-local action-at-a-distance. Note,
though, that as in the analogous case in the pilot-wave theory, even though what’s happening in
Alice’s boxes is affected by Bob’s distant actions, Alice has no way to observe this change. She
could open her boxes and see where the particle is, and she would of course ﬁnd it somewhere.
But she would have no way to know whether it was her own observation that triggered her particle
to randomly coalesce either in her right hand or her left hand, or whether, instead, the particle had
already coalesced in one place or the other as a result of Bob’s distant actions. So although there
is nonlocal action-at-a-distance, according to the theory, the nonlocality cannot be used to transmit
messages faster than light, and so avoids the most blatant sort of conﬂict with relativity theory
in his left hand, or instead the one in his right hand. The measuring device is initially
in its ready state, with the pointer at y = 0, and we assume the pointer moves to the
right/left if particle 2 is found in the right/left-hand box.
Now suppose that at t = 0 Bob decides to proceed with the measurement, i.e., to
let the measuring device begin interacting with his half-boxes. A space-time diagram
showing the mass densities associated with the two particles and the pointer is shown
in Fig.9.8. The important point is as follows. Prior to t = 0, the mass density
associated with Alice’s particle is genuinely split 50/50 between her two half-boxes.
And it would (with extremely high probability) have remained so split (for millions
of years!) had Bob not initiated the position measurement on his own particle. But
when he does initiate this position measurement, it has the effect, by the mechanism
we discussed in the previous section, of causing (in some very short period of time) a
collapse to one or the other of the deﬁnite, initially superposed states. Thus not only
Bob’s particle, but also Alice’s distant one, will switch from being “evenly smeared”
between the two half boxes, to being deﬁnitely in one or the other of the two half
boxes, as a direct result of Bob’s decision to initiate his measurement procedure.
Bob’s decision – a million miles to the right – thus (almost) instantaneously inﬂuences

264
9
The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
the distribution of mass (associated with Alice’s particle) even though Alice’s particle
is a million miles to the left. It is a clear-cut case of nonlocal action-at-a-distance.
(You are invited, in the Projects, to render this diagnosis in a more formal way by
applying Bell’s locality condition or one of our modiﬁcations of it.)
The case of GRWf is basically the same, although it is slightly harder to draw a
nice picture to capture the nonlocality since, as mentioned, for individual particles,
the space-time diagram would be almost completely empty. Still, the same kind of
analysis applies. Suppose, for example, that the two particles are prepared, just as
before, in the state
ψ(x1, x2) =
1
√
2

ψ A
L (x1)ψB
L (x2) + ψ A
R(x1)ψB
R(x2)

.
(9.37)
Now, there is a certain (very small, but nonzero) probability that, according to the
theory, there will be a “ﬂash” inside the box in Alice’s left hand in, say, the next one
minute. However, if Bob measures the position of his particle in the same way we
described before, this probability (for a ﬂash to appear in L A) will either double (if
Bob’s measurement “ﬁnds” his particle on the left) or will go to zero (if Bob instead
“ﬁnds” his particle on the right). Thus, the probability for a certain event over where
Alice is, a million miles to the left, will be different depending on what happens over
where Bob is, a million miles to the right, even when we are conditionalizing those
probabilities on a complete speciﬁcation of events (including, here, in particular, the
fact that there have been no prior ﬂashes associated with Alice’s particle!) in the past
light cone of the event in question.
So, with either the “m” or “f” ontology, the GRW theory is nonlocal, just like the
pilot-wave theory, and just like we should have expected on the grounds of Bell’s
theorem.
However, as ﬁrst pointed out by Bell, there is a sense in which the spontaneous
collapse theories seem to be more compatible with relativity – or at least a little
more promising in that respect – than the pilot-wave theory [1]. This has to do
with the fact that the spontaneous collapse theories are irreducibly stochastic (unlike
the pilot-wave theory, which is deterministic). The technical details are somewhat
beyond the level of this book, but it should be noted that spontaneous collapse theories
with both “mass ﬁeld” and “ﬂash” ontologies have been constructed which, despite
being non-local, appear to be more plausibly consistent with a more serious notion
of fundamental Lorentz invariance than appears to be possible with pilot-wave type
theories [4, 5]. That is, the spontaneous collapse theories warrant a somewhat hopeful
attitude toward the project – which you may not until this very moment even have
conceived of as a possibility – of reconciling non-locality (which we know, from
Bell’stheorem,mustbepresent)withsomesatisfyingnotionoffundamentalrelativity
(which, needless to say, there is strong reason to demand).2
2The idea that it might be possible, after all, to reconcile relativity with non-locality may perhaps
suggest that earlier chapters have over-stated the extent to which Bell’s formulation of local-
ity successfully captures the idea of “no faster-than-light causal inﬂuences” that we ordinarily
take to be an implication of relativity theory. Let me assure you that this is not the case. The quantum

The technical details involved in these issues deﬁnitely render them beyond the
scope of the present book. But one can nevertheless appreciate that certain seemingly
simple questions – for example, “What precisely does it mean for a theory to be
fundamentally relativistic?” – turn out to be surprisingly difﬁcult to answer in a
context in which they are entangled with the possibility of irreducibly stochastic (non-
deterministic) laws, unclarity about ontology (how quantum wave functions relate
to goings-on in 3+1-dimensional space-time), and other issues we have grappled
with in this book. Sufﬁce it to say here that this remains an area of continuing
controversy and ongoing research, but that the spontaneous collapse theories have
put on the table, for further analysis and contemplation, the previously-unrecognized
possibility that Bell’s theorem (and the associated experiments) could live in harmony
with fundamental relativity.
9.4
Empirical Tests of GRW
So far we have presented the spontaneous collapse theory as a way of reformulating
quantum mechanics so that it (i) posits a clear set of unambiguous and universal
dynamical rules and (ii) provides a coherent ontology in terms of which directly
observable macroscopic features of the real world can be recognized. The goal has
been basically to clean up the foundational problems that plague ordinary quantum
theory, while maintaining (as closely as possible) quantum theory’s seemingly accu-
rate empirical predictions. But, as hinted at the beginning of this chapter, because they
predict that spontaneous collapses will occur with speciﬁc length- and time-scales,
the spontaneous collapse theories do, in principle, make slightly different empirical
predictions from ordinary quantum mechanics. And of course this is nice, because
it means that spontaneous collapse theories can be tested, experimentally, against
other versions of quantum mechanics.
The easiest type of test to understand involves something like two-slit interference.
Recall that, for a single particle, spontaneous collapses, which localize the particle’s
wave function to a distance scale of order σ, happen with frequency λ, i.e., on a
timescale τ = 1/λ. It should thus be clear that, in an interference experiment with
individual particles, spontaneous collapse theories will predict that the interference
should start to disappear if the spatial separation between the individual components
of the wave function exceeds σ for a time period greater than τ. Thus, the successful
observation of interference places experimental constraints on the values of σ and τ,
or equivalently, σ and λ.
(Footnote 2 continued)
non-locality really does mean that there are causal linkages between space-like separated events, of
a sort normally thought to be prohibited by relativity. The possibility of perhaps reconciling non-
locality with relativity does not mean that we previously misunderstood or misformulated locality.
Rather, it means that there may have been something rather deep and subtle wrong with the way
we were thinking about relativity (or causality or both) that fooled us into thinking that relativity
was incompatible with space-like separated events being causally linked.

266
9
The Spontaneous Collapse Theory
Of course, for interference experiments involving single particles, the particles are
typically in a state of spatial superposition for only some small fraction of a second.
So the experimental constraint is something like τ ≫1 s, i.e., λ ≪1 s−1. The value
of λ proposed by GRW, recall, was λ ≈10−16 s−1. So the experimental constraint
coming from, say, single-neutron interferometry, is almost completely useless: it tells
us only that, if the spontaneous collapse theories are right, the frequency of collapses
must be much smaller than something that is already 16 orders of magnitude bigger
than what we guessed the frequency might be!
However, as we saw previously, the effective collapse rate for an object consisting
of N particles is Nλ. So, by performing interference experiments with atoms, mole-
cules, and even larger objects, we can start to get experimental constraints that are
at least in the neighborhood of the hypothesized values of the collapse parameters.
For example, in 1999, a group led by Markus Arndt and Anton Zeilinger in Vienna
demonstrated interference using “buckyballs”, which are C60 molecules [6]. Sixty
carbon atoms, each containing 12 nucleons (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and 6 elec-
trons, is roughly a thousand elementary particles. So the spontaneous collapse rate
for buckyballs should be about a thousand times faster than the fundamental (per
particle) collapse rate, and so the experimental constraint on the GRW parameters is
about three orders of magnitude closer to relevancy.
In subsequent years, interference with even bigger molecules has been demon-
strated, and there are plans for pushing this particular envelope even further [7]. In
addition, experimental limits on the spontaneous collapse parameters can also be
extracted from other kinds of observations. For example, spontaneous localizations
add high-momentum Fourier components to wave functions and thereby add energy
to systems that would not otherwise be present. Such additions of energy might be
observed as anomalous warming of otherwise-thermally-isolated systems, or per-
haps anomalous emission of high-energy particles such as X-rays. Some of these
processes can be explored in more detail in the Projects.
In a very nice recent paper, Tumulka and Feldmann have organized the vari-
ous known experimental constraints on the spontaneous collapse parameters, and
produced a “parameter diagram” showing ranges of values that are excluded by
the different types of observations [8]. We reproduce one of their diagrams here
as Fig.9.9. As might have been anticipated from our previous discussion, the most
stringent constraints actually do not come from interference experiments, but arise
instead from observations of systems (like the intergalactic medium!) with consid-
erably more particles. Note also that these kinds of observational constraints tend to
exclude the “upper left” portion of the parameter space, i.e., large values of λ and
small values of σ.
A rather different kind of constraint tends to exclude the opposite region of the
parameter space, i.e., very small values of λ and very large values of σ. The idea here
goes back to one of the original motivating goals of the spontaneous collapse theories,
whichistoavoidtheembarrassingsortofmacroscopicsuperpositionthatisillustrated
by Schrödinger’s cat. More speciﬁcally, the idea is that we know, just from ordinary
direct perceptual experience of the physical world around us, that macroscopic things
do not appear “blurry”. So their positions must be sharply deﬁned at length scales

earlier, showing the values of σ (the spatial width of the collapse function gr(x)) and λ (the collapse
frequency) that are excluded by various sorts of observations, from Ref. [8]. The ﬁve numbered
categories of experimental/observational constraints are “I = spontaneous x-ray emission, II =
spontaneous warming of the intergalactic medium (dashed line), III = spontaneous warming of
air, IV = decay of supercurrents (dashed-and-dotted line), V = diffraction experiments [8].” Note

where any blurriness would be perceptually evident – say, something of order a
millimeter. Or at least, visible macroscopic things should not remain blurry at a
distance scale much larger than a millimeter, for a time long enough for us to notice
the blurriness! One can see in principle here how small values of λ and large values
of σ can be excluded as “perceptually unsatisfactory”. See Fig.9.10 for Tumulka and
Feldmann’s nice diagram showing both the “Empirically Refuted Region” and (what
they call the “Philosophically Unsatisfactory Region” but I would prefer to call) the
“Perceptually Unsatisfactory Region” of parameter space for both GRW and CSL.
We close this section and this Chapter with one ﬁnal Figure from the paper by
Tumulka and Feldmann. In Fig.9.11 we reproduce their diagram showing the pro-
gression of experimental constraints, coming from interference experiments, over
time. The visual implication is that we are perhaps only two or three decades away
from the ability to experimentally probe the parameter values originally suggested
by GRW. Thus, the “open window” – between the ERR and PUR in Fig.9.10 –
may close in the near future, and we will know, once and for all, whether or not the
spontaneous collapse models are right.

9.1 Work carefully through all the steps to convince yourself that Eqs.(9.16) and
(9.17) are correct.
9.2 Suppose a particle with a Gaussian wave function ψ(x) ∼e−x2/4w2
0 suffers
a spontaneous collapse centered at x = r. Show that the post-collapse wave
function remains Gaussian, and ﬁnd a formula for its width w in terms of w0
and σ. (Conﬁrm that your expression for w implies that w ≈w0 if σ ≫w0,
and implies that w ≈σ if w0 ≫σ.)
9.3 Suppose a particle has a Gaussian wave function ψ(x) ∼e−x2/4w2
0 at the
moment just before it suffers a spontaneous collapse. What is the probability
density P(r) for the collapse to be centered at x = r?
9.4 Argue that the probability distribution P(r) deﬁned in Eq.(9.11) is indeed a
legitimate probability distribution since P(r) > 0 and

P(r) dr = 1.
9.5 The discussion in Sect.9.2 suggests that whereas for a single particle the local-
ization rate is λ, for a collection of N particles the localization rate is Nλ. This
is basically equivalent to saying that collections of particles should have an
overall localization rate that is proportional to the total mass of the collection –
an idea that can and probably should be instituted as part of the formulation
of the theory at the fundamental level: different particle species (electrons and
protons, for example) may have different fundamental localization rates, with
the rates being proportional to the mass of the particle. Assuming such a mod-
iﬁcation of the theory, is it nucleons (neutrons and protons) or electrons that
suffer most of the localizations associated with ordinary matter?
9.6 It may appear puzzling that the spatial probability distribution for the point
r at which a localization is centered, is given by P(r) = N(r)2 rather
than the seemingly simpler and approximately equivalent alternative P(r) =
|ψ(r, t−)|2. The reason for this has to do with the requirement that non-local
signaling(i.e.,instantaneouscommunicationacrossarbitrarydistances)should
be impossible. Consider a situation involving two entangled and spatially-
separated particles, 1 and 2, and suppose that particle 1 suffers a spontaneous
collapse centered at x1 = r at time t. Show that the pre-collapse marginal
distribution for particle 2 to be observed at position x2, namely
P(x2, t−) =
 ψ(x1, x2, t−)

is the same as the post-collapse marginal distribution (averaged over all the
points r at which the collapse might have been centered)

provided P(r) = N(r)2. (This means, for example, that Alice cannot tell, by
measurements made on her particle, whether a distant entangled particle has
suffered a collapse. This in turn prevents Bob from sending her a message, by
for example choosing whether or not to allow his particle – entangled with her
distant one – to interact with a macroscopic object such as a measuring device
and thereby trigger a collapse.)
9.7 Consider a one gram pointer. In GRW with the “ﬂash” ontology, approximately
how many ﬂashes occur, associated with the pointer, per second, if the ﬂash
rate f is as given in the text? (Assume for simplicity that only the nucleons
are hit by spontaneous localizations.)
9.8 Approximately what fraction of the particles composing your body will pop
brieﬂy into existence (in a “ﬂash”) at least once during your lifetime, according
to GRWf?
9.9 Consider the conduction electrons in a macroscopic piece of metal. These
can be thought of as having wave functions that spread out over the entire,
macroscopic extent of the metal. For such an electron with essentially zero
momentum, its kinetic energy will also be approximately zero. However, if
it happens to suffer a spontaneous localization its wave function will subse-
quently be a width-σ Gaussian. Estimate the increase in the particle’s kinetic
energy that results from this spontaneous localization, and use this to estimate
the rate at which the temperature of a thermally isolated piece of metal should
increase according to the spontaneous collapse theory. Would this “anomalous
heating” be easy to detect, experimentally?
9.10 Use Bell’s formulation of locality (and/or one of our modiﬁed versions from
Chap.1 or Chap.5) to more formally diagnose GRWm as a non-local theory,
using the example displayed in and discussed around Fig.9.8. (Note: you will
need to think carefully about which formulation of locality it is possible and
appropriate to use here.)
9.11 In Sect.9.3, we discussed the non-local character of both GRWm and GRWf
in terms of a “double Einstein’s boxes situation, in which two particles are
each split between two pairs of half-boxes.” This example is nice because it
provides another opportunity to think about how the spontaneous collapses
function in the presence of entanglement. But it is really more complicated
than is minimally necessary to establish the non-locality of the theory. Show
and explain how a “[single] Einstein’s boxes” situation, like that discussed in
Sect.4.1 of Chap.4, can already be used to diagnose the spontaneous collapse
theories as non-local. (Note that this means, interestingly, that there are sit-
uations whose explanation involves non-locality in GRW, but is local in the
pilot-wave theory.)

9.4 Empirical Tests of GRW
271
9.12 A single character printed in ink contains something of order 1017 carbon atoms
or roughly 1018 nucleons. In GRWf, how many ﬂashes per second (associated
with that small amount of ink) do you think are sufﬁcient to say that the ink
drop is really there, with the particular shape we see? (Hint: human visual
perception can be modeled as something like a digital camera which captures
roughly 30 frames per second. Consistency with perceptual experience would
seem to require that typical frames contain enough ﬂashes to construct the
shape of the appropriate letter unambiguously.) Use your estimate to calculate
the minimum localization rate λ compatible with “perceptual acceptability”,
and compare your calculated value to Fig.9.10.
9.13 In Ref. [8], Tumulka and Feldmann raise an interesting question: what if some
future experiment demonstrates violations of ordinary QM and conﬁrms the
empirical predictions of GRW/CSL, but for parameter values which lie in
the “perceptually unsatisfactory region” (PUR) of Fig.9.10. What would you
say/conclude in such a situation?
9.14 True of false: according to the spontaneous collapse theories, matter is made
of particles. Explain.
9.15 There are a lot of things to like about the spontaneous collapse theories: they
sharpen, with precise mathematics, the “loose talk” of Copenhagen QM; they
provide comprehensible (if unanticipated) ontologies; and they make empiri-
cally testable predictions that differ from other versions of QM. But it is also
possible to ﬁnd the spontaneous collapse theories somewhat contrived and ad
hoc. Explain why, by listing and discussing some of the details about the the-
ory’s formulation which seem arbitrary and/or which could easily be changed
without dramatically affecting the theory’s structure or predictions.

Chapter 10
The Many-Worlds Theory
The last version of quantum mechanics that we will explore in detail was developed
by Hugh Everett III while he was a graduate student under John Wheeler in the 1950s.
Everett’s basic idea is at once beautifully elegant and uncomfortably radical. Max
Jammer rightly described it as “one of the most daring and most ambitious theories
ever constructed in the history of science” [1].
Some idea about the nature of Everett’s proposal can be gleaned by the different
titles used for various draft versions of his PhD thesis: “Quantum Mechanics by
the Method of the Universal Wave Function”, “Wave Mechanics Without Probabil-
ity”, and “On the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics [2].” Everett’s thesis advi-
sor, John Wheeler, was a strong proponent of Bohr’s Copenhagen interpretation
and was thus sensitive not only about the radical nature of Everett’s proposal, but
also about Everett’s sharp criticisms of the Copenhagen philosophy. Wheeler thus
demanded that Everett produce a signiﬁcantly toned-down presentation of his ideas;
this was ultimately published in 1957 with the somewhat cryptic title “[The] ‘Rel-
ative State’ Formulation of Quantum Mechanics [3].” The somewhat muted nature
of the presentation in this published version probably contributed to Everett’s ideas
not being widely understood or appreciated for several subsequent decades, and
his near-complete departure from the world of theoretical physics. But Everett did
inspire a few early followers such as Bryce deWitt who, along with his own graduate
student Neill Graham, published the original, full-length version of Wheeler’s thesis,
as well as some other commentary, as “The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics [4]”. This title is probably the most accurately descriptive of Everett’s
ideas, and is the one by which the theory has largely come to be described today.

The Many-Worlds Theory
10.1
The Basic Idea
As with the Spontaneous Collapse theory of the last chapter, Everett’s theory is
principally motivated by the Measurement Problem that we studied in Chap.3. In
Everett’s description, the usual quantum formalism contains two incompatible rules,
“Process 1” and “Process 2”, for how the states of quantum systems evolve. Process 1
is the discontinuous and random change that is postulated to occur when an observer
or measuring instrument from outside the quantum system interacts with it in an
appropriateway,whereasProcess2isthecontinuousanddeterministicstateevolution
describedbytheSchrödingerequation.Everettbemoansthefactthat,sincemeasuring
instruments (and ultimately observers) are just physical systems like any other, it
is simply not clear when the two very different Processes are supposed to apply.
Discussing an isolated system that includes an observer or measuring instrument,
Everett writes:
Can the change with time of the state of the total system be described by Process 2? If so,
then it would appear that no discontinuous probabilistic process like Process 1 can take place.
If not, we are forced to admit that systems which contain observers are not subject to the
same kind of quantum-mechanical description as we admit for all other physical systems.
[And note that when we speak of an “observer”, we really mean things like] photoelectric
cells, photographic plates, and similar devices where a mechanistic attitude can hardly be
contested [3].
Moreover, if one wants to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole (which
is natural in cosmology and in particular in the quest to unify quantum theory and
gravitation) the idea of an “outside observer” becomes obviously incoherent:
No way is evident to apply the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics to a system
that is not subject to external observation. The whole interpretive scheme of that formal-
ism rests upon the notion of external observation. The probabilities of the various possible
outcomes of the observation are prescribed exclusively by Process 1. Without that part of
the formalism there is no means whatever to ascribe a physical interpretation to the conven-
tional machinery. But Process 1 is out of the question for systems not subject to external
observation [3].
Everett’s central idea, therefore, is to simply abandon Process 1:
This paper proposes to regard pure wave mechanics (Process 2 only) as a complete theory.
It postulates that a wave function that obeys a linear wave equation everywhere and at all
times supplies a complete mathematical model for every isolated physical system without
exception. It further postulates that every system that is subject to external observation can be
regarded as part of a larger isolated system. The wave function is taken as the basic physical
entity.... [3]
Let us think through what that means, in the context of our standard example: the
measurement of the energy of a particle-in-a-box (whose spatial coordinate we call x)
using an energy-measuring-device (whose pointer has center of mass coordinate y).
We would describe the measuring device as faithfully and accurately measuring
the energy of the particle if, when the particle is initially in an energy eigenstate
ψk(x) (with eigenvalue Ek), the interaction causes the apparatus pointer to move by

10.1 The Basic Idea
275
a distance proportional to Ek. That is, we assume that Process 2 – Schrödinger’s
equation – evolves the joint quantum state of the particle and pointer as follows:
ψk(x)φ0(y) →ψk(x)φ0(y −λEkt)
(10.1)
where t is the duration of the interaction. It then immediately follows from the linear-
ity of Schrödinger’s equation that, if the particle-in-a-box is initially in a superposi-
tion of several different energy eigenstates, the system will evolve into an entangled
superposition as follows:

i
ci ψi(x)

φ0(y) →

i
ci ψi(x) φ0(y −λEit).
(10.2)
All three versions of quantum theory that we have studied so far have regarded
this last formula as problematic, and have thus proposed some way of resolving
the problem. The orthodox/Copenhagen view, for example, would say that it was
inappropriate to try to describe the measurement interaction in terms of a quantum
mechanical wave function; measuring devices are classical objects, so we should
have treated the interaction instead using Process 1, according to which the post-
interaction state involves a collapsed wave function for the particle-in-a-box and a
pointer with a deﬁnite, classical position. The pilot-wave theory accepts that there is a
wave function associated with the particle-pointer system, and that the wave function
indeed evolves into a state like that in Eq.(10.2), but insists that the real physical
state of the pointer is not to be found in this wave function but instead in the actual
positions of the associated particles, which will be unambiguous and unproblematic.
Finally, the spontaneous collapse theory insists that the wave function for a system
including a macroscopic pointer will simply not obey Schrödinger’s equation, and
so the troubling macroscopic superposition state, Eq.(10.2), simply will not arise (or
at least, will not arise for long enough to notice!).
In contrast to all three of these views, Everett wants to say, about Eq.(10.2), that it
is ﬁne; there is no problem. To understand this, though, it will help to brieﬂy review
what the problem with Eq.(10.2) was supposed to be. In short, the problem was
that Eq.(10.2) involves a superposition of different positions for the (macroscopic,
directly observable) pointer. It’s frankly not even exactly clear what this means, or
what it would look like, but apparently it is some kind of state in which the pointer
somehow has several different positions at the same time. It seems it should appear in
some sense “blurred” among the several different positions. But, of course, nobody
has ever seen a pointer in a state like that. Real pointers always point this way or
that. And so Eq.(10.2) simply cannot provide a faithful, direct, literal, complete
description of the physical state of the pointer. Or at least that is what we have been
taking for granted until now.
Everett, though, invites us to consider in more detail what – according to quantum
mechanics – the pointer in a state like Eq.(10.2) would look like. To analyze this,
we should consider the different possible states that an observer might get into upon

276
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
interacting with a pointer. Suppose, to begin with, that the observer – whose (many!)
degrees of freedom we call z – begins in a “ready” state, χ0(z). Suppose he interacts
with a pointer with a reasonably well-deﬁned position y = yk. Then the observer
should get into a state χk(z) in which he has seen (and, for example, remembers
seeing, and will, if asked, report having seen) that the pointer has position yk. That
is, during the time of interaction between the pointer and the observer, Schrödinger’s
equation should evolve the quantum state as follows:
φ0(y −yk) χ0(z) →φ0(y −yk) χk(z).
(10.3)
But then, just as before, it immediately follows from the linearity of Schrödinger’s
equation that if the observer observes the position of the pointer in the particle-pointer
system, described by Eq.(10.2), the quantum state of the particle-pointer-observer
system will evolve as follows:

i
ci ψi(x) φ0(y −yi)

χ0(z) →

i
ci ψi(x) φ0(y −yi) χi(z).
(10.4)
So, in the same way that the pointer failed to pick out some one particular out-
come from the set of superposed “possibilities”, but instead got tangled up in the
superposition, so now the observer (of the pointer) does not end up in a state that
corresponds to seeing some one particular location for the pointer. Instead he, too,
joins the entangled superposition. It is, of course, unclear exactly what to make of
this. But notice right away one thing that this deﬁnitely does not say: it does not say
(or at any rate, does not seem to say) that the observer will be in a state in which he
deﬁnitely experiences (and remembers experiencing and will report, if asked, having
experienced) the pointer as “looking blurry” or “being smeared out among several
different positions”. Everett explained this as follows in his thesis:
Why doesn’t our observer see a smeared out needle? The answer is quite simple. He behaves
just like the apparatus did. When he looks at the needle (interacts) he himself becomes
smeared out, but at the same time correlated to the apparatus, and hence to the system....
[T]he observer himself has split into a number of observers, each of which sees a deﬁnite
result of the measurement.... As an analogy one can imagine an intelligent amoeba with a
good memory. As time progresses the amoeba is constantly splitting [2].
Whatever else one wants to say, there is a suggestion here that our assumption that
there was some kind of fatal problem with Eq.(10.2) – that the particle-pointer
system just obviously wouldn’t look right if this were the correct and complete state
description – was perhaps too hasty.
It will be helpful here to follow Everett in introducing the concept of a “relative
state”. As he points out, in a system described, for example, by Eq.(10.2), neither
of the components – the particle or the pointer – can be attributed a deﬁnite state
of their own. That’s essentially what “entanglement” means. But Everett points out
that we can deﬁne a “relative state” for each component, relative, in particular, to the

10.1 The Basic Idea
277
other component’s being in a particular state. For example, the state of the pointer
relative to the particle-in-a-box being in state ψk(x) is deﬁned to be
φrel. to ψk(x)(y) ∼

ψ∗
k(x)(x, y)dx
(10.5)
where (x, y) is just the joint particle-pointer state given in Eq.(10.2). (The “∼” is
because the right hand side here is not properly normalized.) Plugging in, we ﬁnd
φrel. to ψk(x)(y) ∼

ψ∗
k(x)

i
ciψi(x)φ0(y −λEit)
= ckφ0(y −λEkt)
(10.6)
since the different ψi(x)’s are orthonormal:

ψ∗
k(x)ψi(x)dx = δi,k. So the (properly
normalized) relative state is just
φrel. to ψk(x)(y) = φ0(y −λEkt).
(10.7)
In words: relative to the PIB being in a particular energy eigenstate, the pointer ends
up in a perfectly deﬁnite and appropriate state, namely, one in which it indicates the
energy Ek of the PIB.
The converse also holds: relative to the pointer indicating outcome Ek, the PIB
is in the state ψk(x). And we can generalize this concept to bring in the observer as
well: when the overall particle-pointer-observer wave function is given by the right
hand side of Eq.(10.4), relative to the PIB being in the state ψk(x), not only does the
pointer indicate that its energy is Ek, but the observer sees (and remembers seeing
and will report having seen) the pointer indicating that its energy is Ek.
This idea of “relative state” provides a way of capturing the fact that, although it
remains puzzling, a state like the right hand side of Eq.(10.4) is not just utter chaos. It
is not just some kind of incomprehensible blur in which everything is happening in a
completely mixed-up way. Rather, there are deﬁnite correlations built into the state:
it is an orderly mixture, in some sense, of several individually perfectly reasonable
situations, in which the PIB has a deﬁnite energy, and the pointer indicates correctly
what its energy is, and the observer sees the pointer indicating its energy and correctly
and validly infers what its energy is.
It is clear that subsequent interactions will work exactly the same way, and just
bring more and more of the world into the mixture. For example, the air molecules
in the vicinity of the pointer get jostled around in slightly different ways depending
on how fast the pointer moves during its journey from its “ready” position to its
ﬁnal position, and where exactly that ﬁnal position is. Of course, there are several
distinct ﬁnal positions in the mix, and so, just like the observer, the air molecules
join the entangled superposition. They cannot be said to have any particular deﬁnite
state of their own, but relative to the pointer being in a particular ﬁnal position, their
conﬁguration is clear and deﬁnite and sensible. Similarly, if the observer’s mom

278
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
calls him on the phone to ask how his energy measurement turned out, she will
now also join the entangled superposition, as will the ink molecules in the physics
journal where he publishes his results. There will not be any one particular fact of
the matter about what his mom hears or what is printed in the journal; but “relative
to” the observer seeing the pointer at y = λEkt (and relative to the pointer being at
y = λEkt and relative to the energy of the PIB being Ek) mom will hear, and the
journal will report in print, that the energy measurement came out Ek. And so on.
It is as if the big (and ever-expanding) entangled superposition, which we pre-
viously took as just somehow obviously wrong, is actually describing all of these
perfectly coherent stories playing out in parallel. Except that, for Everett, it is not
merely “as if” this were the case. Everett’s idea is precisely that this is literally the
case. By eliminating “Process 1” and letting the universe be described by a sin-
gle wave function, evolving always exclusively according to the linear Schrödinger
equation (Process 2), we arrive at the following picture: whenever we would have
said (according to one of the previously considered formulations of QM) that there
were several distinct possibilities, only one of which is in fact realized, instead in
Everett’s theory all of the possibilities are realized; the world splits into several
branches, each of which realizes one of the possibilities. Further interactions then
produce further branchings in each original branch, and so on. The overall pattern
of iterative branching is indicated schematically in Fig.10.1.
A few words of clariﬁcation are in order. First, although Everett’s theory is often
called the “many worlds” theory and the different branches are sometimes referred to
as (for example) “parallel universes”, these turns of phrase can also cause confusion
t
q = {x, y, z, ...}

10.1 The Basic Idea
279
and suggest misleading pictures. Really, according to Everett’s theory, there is only
one universe, only one world. It’s not, for example, that every time a quantum event
(triggering a branching) occurs, a whole new copy of the physical universe is created,
ex nihilo, “next to” the old one, such that, over time, more and more and more
universes are all existing, in some sense separately. (People who misunderstand
Everett’s idea in this way often complain, for example, that the multiplication of
worlds ﬂagrantly violates the idea of mass or energy conservation.)
Instead, it is supposed to be the case that the matter in the one, only-existing
universe just has these different patterns going on in it, all, so to speak, on top of one
another. Perhaps a good analogy here would be to light waves: if you’re driving your
car during the daytime and turn on the headlights, the region in front of the lights has
(let’s say) some light waves, propagating east, emitted by the headlights – and also
some light waves, headed down, emitted by the sun. These two things are happening
in the same place and are associated with the same one underlying ﬁeld. They are
distinct structural patterns in that ﬁeld. But the dynamics of the ﬁeld is such that the
two patterns do not affect each other. The light waves from the sun just do their thing,
passing downward, in the same way they would if the light from the car headlights
were not there, and vice versa. The non-interaction of these two light waves explains
why it is appropriate to think of what’s going on in terms of these two overlapping
but distinct patterns.
One should remember, though, that unlike electromagnetic waves which propa-
gate in 3-dimensional physical space, the quantum mechanical wave function exists
in a very high-dimensional space. So one should for example recognize that the hor-
izontal, “spatial” axis in Fig.10.1 is a very schematic simpliﬁed way of representing
what is in fact a space of enormous dimension. This is also relevant to understanding
why the different branches, once formed, do not interact. In principle, packets can
interact, by interfering with each other, if they overlap. But here “overlap” means
“overlap in conﬁguration space” – because that is where the wave function lives. If
one is thinking about a single particle moving in one dimension, it may seem very
probable that, for example, if the wave packet splits into two “branches”, one of
which moves off to the left and the other to the right, it might occur (for example
if one of the packets reﬂects off something and moves back the other way) that the
two packets might come again to overlap, producing some interference effects. In
princple this can happen, but due to a phenomenon called “decoherence” this basi-
cally never happens in practice once the difference between two branches becomes
macroscopic (which by the way is when you’d ﬁrst be justiﬁed in thinking of them
as distinct branches).
You can think of it this way: conﬁguration space is really high-dimensional. So
there’s just a lot of room there. If a branching event occurs, like when our energy
measuring device interacts with the PIB, it’s not just – as our schematic treatment in
terms of the center of mass coordinate y might suggest – that the two wave function
packets separate by a small macroscopic distance d (say, a centimeter). In fact, there
are some enormous number – 1023 or something – of particles in the pointer. So the
two wave packets in conﬁguration space are not just separated by distance d. Rather,
they are separated by distance d in each of some 1023 distinct coordinates. So, by

280
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
a high-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem, the packets are actually
separated by something like a centimeter times
√
1023, i.e., about two million miles.
The packets are, for all practical purposes, permanently and irreparably separated
by a vast distance in conﬁguration space, never to interact again. (And note that
the separation and its irreparability only continue to increase as the pointer interacts
with air molecules in its vicinity, which then in turn interact with further degrees of
freedom that they are in contact with, and so on.)
So that is a nice way to think about the process, decoherence, that makes these
individual branches in the wave function very stable, separate, non-interacting. What
might seem like a very small difference between two branches actually (when we
remember the enormous and ever-increasing number of particles that are involved)
implies that the branches are extremely well-separated in the vast open wilderness
of conﬁguration space and will hence never see each other again.
Everett summarizes the overall idea as follows:
Wethusarriveatthefollowingpicture:Throughoutallofasequenceofobservationprocesses,
there is only one physical system representing the observer, yet there is no single unique state
ofthe observer(whichfollowsfromthe representationsofinteractingsystems).Nevertheless,
there is a representation in terms of a superposition, each element of which contains a deﬁnite
observer state and a corresponding system state. Thus with each succeeding observation (or
interaction), the observer state ‘branches’ into a number of different states. Each branch
represents a different outcome of the measurement and the corresponding eigenstate for the
object-system state. All branches exist simultaneously in the superposition after any given
sequence of observations.
[In a footnote he adds:] From the viewpoint of the theory all elements of a superposition
(all ‘branches’) are ‘actual’, none any more ‘real’ than the rest. It is unnecessary to suppose
that all but one are somehow destroyed, since all the separate elements of a superposition
individually obey the wave equation with complete indifference to the presence or absence
(‘actuality’ or not) of any other elements. This total lack of effect of one branch on another
also implies that no observer will ever be aware of any ‘splitting’ process [3].
10.2
Probability
In the last section, we started to come to grips with Everett’s central idea of sim-
ply omitting, from the axioms of quantum theory, the measurement postulates (such
as the Born rule) which seem difﬁcult to reconcile, at the fundamental level, with
Schrödinger’s equation. However, in the conventional interpretation, these measure-
ment postulates provide practically the entire testable content of the theory – they tell
us, in particular, about the probabilities for various possible measurement outcomes.
And it is precisely the fact that these probabilities match up with the empirically
observed outcome frequencies, that we believe in the quantum formalism in the ﬁrst
place. So if Everett’s “many worlds” theory is to be worth taking seriously at all, it
will need to be able to account for these conventional probabilistic claims.
From his very ﬁrst presentation of the many worlds idea, Everett recognized the
importance of being able to somehow derive the Born rule (in the context of his new

10.2 Probability
281
theory which adamantly does not just posit it as an axiom). Indeed, Everett claimed
to provide such a derivation/explanation already in 1957:
The new theory is not based on any radical departure from the conventional one. The special
postulates in the old theory which deal with observation are omitted in the new theory. The
altered theory thereby acquires a new character. It has to be analyzed in and for itself before
any identiﬁcation becomes possible between the quantities of the theory and the properties of
the world of experience. The identiﬁcation, when made, leads back to the omitted postulates
of the conventional theory that deal with observation, but in a manner which clariﬁes their
role and logical position [3].
However, Everett’s claim has been met with skepticism and in general this issue has
remained a highly controversial one ever since Everett’s original proposal.
Let’s try to understand what’s at issue here, starting with a simple example.
Suppose an experimenter prepares a spin 1/2 particle in the “spin-up along the
x-direction” state,
ψ+x =
1
√
2
(ψ+z + ψ−z) ,
(10.8)
and then performs a measurement of the z-component of the particle’s spin. Accord-
ing to conventional quantum mechanics, we’d say that there is a 50% probability that
the measurement comes out spin-up (let’s call that “heads” for simplicity here) and
a 50% probability that it comes out spin-down (“tails”). But of course, in Everett’s
view, that’s not right. Instead, according to Everett, both things happen: the act of
measuring the z-spin (i.e., setting up a coupling between the z-component of the
particle’s spin and some eventually-macroscopic degrees of freedom that include
those belonging to the observer himself) triggers a branching of the universal wave
function, and each outcome occurs in one of the two branches. As it is sometimes
put, the observer has two “descendants” – one who sees the experiment come out
“H” and one who sees it come out “T”.
Now suppose the experimenter does this N times – that is, suppose he prepares
a bunch of spin 1/2 particles in the state ψ+x and then measures their z-spins, one
at a time. The branching structure that will be produced is illustrated, for the case
N = 4, in Fig.10.2. At the end, there are 24 = 16 different branches, and the
experimenter observed a different sequence in each one: H H H H for the branch
on the left, H H HT for the next one over, and so on, all the way over to T T T T
on the right. All 16 of these branches appear, in the expression for the total wave
function, with the same amplitude, so aside from each involving a distinct sequence
of outcomes, they all seem to be on an equal footing.
However, for purely combinatoric reasons, certain statistical patterns of outcomes
occur in more branches. For example, there is only the one branch in which the
observer saw 4 Hs, and similarly there is just the one branch in which the observer
saw 4 T s. But there are four branches in which the observer saw 3 Hs and 1 T .
(These four branches have the following sequences: H H HT , H HT H, HT H H,
and T H H H.) Similarly, there are four branches in which the observer saw 1 H and
3 T s. And ﬁnally there are six branches in which the observer sees 2 Hs and 2 T s.
One begins to see the overall pattern: although every possible sequence of outcomes

occurs in precisely one world, most of the worlds will exhibit statistics that are close
to those associated with the Born rule (here, equal numbers of Hs and T s).
In the general case of N binary quantum measurements (which we’ll continue to
think of as coin ﬂips for simplicity), the number gN(n) of worlds in which exactly n
Hs are observed will be “N choose n”:
gN(n) =
N
n

=
N!
n! (N −n)!.
(10.9)
And so (there being 2N worlds at the end of the sequence of experiments) the fraction
fN(n) of worlds in which exactly n Hs are observed will be
fN(n) =
N
n
 1

N
=
N!
n! (N −n)!

(10.10)
For large N, this function of n is well-approximated by a normalized Gaussian whose
center point is at n = N/2 and whose half-width σ is
√
N/2. That is,
fN(n) ∼e−(n−N/2)2/(N/2).
(10.11)
See Fig.10.3 for a sketch.
So again, although each possible sequence is realized in exactly one branch, and
no sequence is in any way preferred over any other, it is the case that, at the end of
the experiment, the overwhelming majority of observers – that is, the overwhelming
majority of descendants of the original observer – will observe a sequence in which

Fig. 10.3 In an experiment involving N binary measurements (in which, according to conven-
tional quantum theory, the probability for each possible outcome is 50%), the fraction fN(n) of
Everettian worlds in which n Hs are observed will be sharply peaked around n = N/2. That is,
the overwhelming majority of observers in the different worlds (i.e., the overwhelming majority of
descendants of the original experimenter) will see approximately Born rule statistics
there are roughly equal numbers of Hs and T s. That is, we can reproduce the Born
rule by looking at the statistical patterns that are typical for universes, i.e., present in
most of the universes. Of course, there will some universes in which very non-Born-
rule statistics (e.g., a string of N consecutive Hs!) will be observed. But so long
as such rogue universes represent a vanishingly small fraction of the total number
of universes it perhaps seems somewhat reasonable to ignore them and claim that,
according to Everett’s theory, observers should typically expect to see Born-rule
statistics.
But there is a serious problem with this line of thinking: it only works for the
special case that, in the conventional way of describing the situation, the outcome
probabilities are 50/50. Or, to put the same point in Everettian terms, it only works for
the special case in which the two branches created by each individual measurement
event appear (in the overall expression for the wave function) with equal amplitudes.
To see this, let’s consider the more general case in which, say, the initial preparation
of each spin 1/2 particle has it being spin-up along a direction ˆn such that
ψ+n = √pψ+z + √qψ−z
(10.12)
where p + q = 1, i.e., p is what would ordinarily be called the probability of H
(i.e., the particle coming out spin-up along z), but which is in the context of Everett’s
theory instead called the branch weight of the “spin-up along z” branch that the
measurement creates.
It is easy to see that, for the N = 4 case, the “tree of outcome sequences” is
exactly the same as what was already displayed in Fig.10.2. The only difference is
that now the branch weights are not all equal. For example, the H H H H branch has
a branch weight p4; the four branches with three Hs and one T each have branch
weight p3q; the six branches with two Hs and two T s have branch weight p2q2; and
so on. In general, the weight of a branch with n Hs and (N −n) T s will be

284
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
wN(n) = pnq(N−n) = pn(1 −p)(N−n).
(10.13)
Now, the Born rule tells us that (in conventional terms) the probability of a H for
each ﬂip is p. So in a sequence of N ﬂips, the expected number of Hs will be Np.
For example, if N = 100 and p = 90% we should expect to see about 90 Hs.
But if we just naively count worlds the way we did before, it remains true that the
overwhelming number of worlds have approximately 50 Hs and approximately 50
T s.
Therefore, in order to continue accounting for the usual Born rule statistics in the
Everettian model, it is necessary to weight the worlds differently – and in particular
to weight each branch by, what else, its branch weight – when we compute the world-
fraction which displays a certain characteristic. We thus deﬁne the weighted world
fraction as follows:
f w
N (n) = gN(n)wN(n).
(10.14)
(Note that what we called fN(n) before is just this same formula but for the special
case p = q = 1/2 in which the weight function wN(n) is equal to 1/2N independent
of n.) One can show that this weighted world fraction function is, for large N,
sharply peaked around n = Np. (See the Projects.) That is, when we include the
non-equal weightings, we can still say that the overwhelming majority of worlds (in
the weighted-by-their-branch-weights sense) will exhibit approximately Born rule
statistics. The idea here is visualized in Fig.10.4.
That sounds good, but also raises a number of questions. For example: what,
exactly, are these “branch weights” that we’ve been talking about? Well, they are
nothing but the (absolute) squares of the amplitudes of the different branches, i.e.,
the different terms in the universal wave function. If, that is, after some sequence of
measurements, the universal wave function has the structure
 =

i
ciψi
(10.15)
(where the index i is labeling particular sequences of measurement outcomes, or
whatever) the branch weight associated with the ith branch is just
wi = |ci|2.
(10.16)
That is, the formula for the branch weights – the equation telling us how much to
“care” about each individual branch in the tree – is really just the Born rule. So the
overall argument has a strong air of circularity about it: if you weight the branches
using the Born rule, then (the Born-rule-weighted-sense-of) “most” of the branches
will display Born rule statistics. It seems that we get the Born rule out (as a description
of the statistics that will be observed in typical branches) only because we put the

Fig. 10.4 Graphical illustration of that fact that, although the (raw, unweighted) number of worlds
in which n “Heads” results appear in a sequence of N quantum coin ﬂips is strongly peaked around
N/2, we can nevertheless say that (in a weighted sense) “most” worlds will display Born rule
statistics, i.e., n ≈Np. Here the raw world-counting function gN(n) is shown as the solid gray
curve; the weighting function wN(n), according to which worlds with larger amplitude or “branch
weight” are more strongly emphasized in the accounting, is shown as the dashed gray curve; and
the weighted world fraction f w
N (n) = gN(n)wN(n) is shown as the solid black curve. The case
p = 3/4 is shown
Born rule in (as a measure of how much each branch should count in our assessment
of what is typical).
There is a long history of proponents of the many worlds interpretation trying to
give further arguments to prove that Eq.(10.16) is somehow the only mathematically
reasonable way to weight the different branches. If this could be convincingly estab-
lished, it would signiﬁcantly reduce the feeling of circularity. You are invited, in the
Projects, to analyze and assess the argument that Everett presented already in 1957.
But there are some deeper concerns as well. For example, the very idea that
we should use this un-equal weighting seems somewhat in conﬂict with Everett’s
overall idea. Recall, for example, Everett’s statement that “none [of the branches
is] any more ‘real’ than the rest”. But what is this non-trivial weighting function,
other than some kind of measure of how real, exactly, each (supposedly equally
real) branch is? Suppose there are just two branches, one – say, in which a red light
ﬂashes – with a branch weight of 1/100, and the other – in which, say, a blue light
ﬂashes instead – with a branch weight of 99/100. Everett would have us say that
the vast majority of worlds – namely, 99% of them – include a ﬂashing blue light.
This may make some kind of sense from the point of view of an external God-like
observer, who can somehow “see” that the blue-light world is brighter (more intense?
heavier?? more real???) than the red-light world. But in some sense Everett’s whole
program is to abandon, as non-existent and meaningless, the idea of such external
God-like observers, and instead to exclusively consider what the world is like “from
the inside”, i.e., according to observers who are part of the world and governed by
its fundamental laws.

286
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
There has indeed been a trend in the recent literature on this issue, away from
treating the “branch weights” as somehow objective facts that we (the theorists ana-
lyzing the merits of Everett’s theory) must acknowledge, and toward treating them
instead as measures of how much individual observers within an Everettian world
should care about their various descendants. As Simon Saunders has summarized
this point,
In recent years, with the development of decision-theory methods for quantifying subjective
probability in quantum mechanics, the link between probability in the subjective sense and
an objective counterpart has been greatly clariﬁed. Speciﬁcally, it can be shown that agents
who are rational, in order to achieve their ends, have no option but to use the modulus
squared branch amplitudes in weighting their utilities. In this sense the Born rule has been
derived [5].
This claim, though, remains controversial, with questions proliferating about: the
necessity of deﬁning (or, indeed, expecting) the “rationality” of agents in the way
required in the derivation; the appropriateness and relevance of focusing on how
agents who believe in Everett’s theory should behave as opposed to explaining why
we should interpret our empirical observations in Everettian terms; and even whether
the concept of “probability” can possibly mean anything in a picture where, with
certainty, everything that can happen will happen.
We will not be able to resolve these issues here. What should be clear, though, is
that the unusual, many-worlds character of Everett’s proposal forces us to reimagine
certain concepts – like “probability” – that play an important role in quantum theory.
As we will see, this uncomfortable “stretching” of concepts previously thought to
be well-understood is a theme that will re-appear as we continue our exploration of
Everett’s proposal.
10.3
Ontology
So far we have followed Everett (and his followers) in essentially taking for granted
that each branch of the universal wave function can be understood as describing a
sensible physical world, with stars and planets and trees and cats and measuring
equipment and observers with brains (whose physical states give rise to appropriate
conscious experiences) and so on. That is, we have just been assuming that (at least at
an appropriately macroscopic coarse-grained level) each branch of the wave function
corresponds to a physical world basically of the sort we take ourselves to experience.
But we should remember, from Chap.5, that the wave function is a funny and
abstract kind of mathematical object. There is no obvious and straightforward sense
in which the wave function can be understood to directly describe physical goings-on
in ordinary three-dimensional space, because the wave function is something like a
ﬁeld on an abstract, high-dimensional conﬁguration space. So we should not simply
take for granted that the wave function (or any individual branch of the wave func-
tion) describes a three-dimensional physical world of the sort we are accustomed to

10.3 Ontology
287
imagining exists. Instead, we should ask: if it does, how, exactly, does the description
work?
One possibility is Schrödinger’s original idea that the wave function can be used
to compute a mass density ﬁeld (on physical, 3D space). Recall that, in this scheme,
the mass density of the ith particle would be given by
ρi(x, t) = mi

|(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t)|2 δ(x −xi) dx1dx2 · · · dxN
(10.17)
and the total mass density would then be
ρ(x, t) =

i
ρi(x, t).
(10.18)
In the context of the GRW theory we discussed in Chap.9, in which only one branch
of the universal wave function survives the spontaneous collapses, we were able
to recognize this mass density ﬁeld as corresponding to a world that “looks right”
at the macroscopic scale. But in the context of Everett’s proposal – in which all
branches of the universal wave function survive – the mass density ﬁeld becomes a
big incoherent mess. In an illuminating discussion of this idea [6] an analogy has
been given to an old TV set which is badly tuned and is therefore receiving and
displaying the programs from several different channels all at once. Indeed, this was
the primary reason that Schrödinger himself abandoned this idea as a possible way
of understanding the ontology associated with the quantum wave function.
But is the mess really so incoherent? Just like, in the TV set analogy, the different
programs (being displayed on top of one another) do not interact with each other, so
the contributions to the mass density ﬁeld from different branches of the wave func-
tion remain dynamically independent. That is, just like two characters from one of the
TV programs will interact with each other (but neither can in any sense interact with
the characters from one of the other simultaneously-displayed programs), so with the
different contributions to the mass density ﬁeld associated with different branches
of the wave function. We should recognize, that is, that the total mass density ﬁeld,
Eq.(10.18), only looks like an incoherent mess to some God-like external observer
(and only then, perhaps implausibly, if She is unable to disentangle the overlapping
programs). In keeping with the Everettian philosophy, though, we recognize this as
irrelevant. To an observer living in that universe, himself made out of some portion
of ρ(x, t) which only interacts with other portions of ρ(x, t) arising from the same
branch of the universal wave function, the world looks entirely coherent. Such an
observer would, in effect, be happily oblivious to the fact that there were count-
less alternative programs playing out literally right on top of him, but the (limited
part of the) world he actually experiences would indeed “look right” – i.e., have the
same kind of overall macroscopic coherence we are familiar with from our actual
experiences.
Let us explain, more formally, how and why the different contributions
to ρ(x, t) arising from different branches of the wave function can be thought of

288
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
as non-interacting and causally independent. Suppose the wave function can be writ-
ten as a linear combination of macroscopically-distinct packets
(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t) =

α
cαα(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t)
(10.19)
where, as discussed in Sect.10.1, the individual packets are well-separated in con-
ﬁguration space so that

∗
β(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t)α(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t) dx1, dx2 · · · dxN = 0
(10.20)
if α ̸= β. (The requirement that the different terms be macroscopically distinct
effectively ensures that two terms which are orthogonal in this sense at one time
will remain orthogonal in the future.) It then follows from Eq.(10.17) that the mass
density associated with the ith particle can be written as
ρi(x, t) =

α
|cα|2ρα
i (x, t)
(10.21)
where
ρα
i (x, t) = mi

|α(x1, x2, . . . , xN, t)|2 δ(x −xi)dx1dx2 · · · dxN
(10.22)
is the mass density of particle i arising speciﬁcally from the α branch of the wave
function.
The total mass density can then similarly be written as
ρ(x, t) =

α
ρα(x, t)
(10.23)
where
ρα(x, t) =

i
ρα
i (x, t)
(10.24)
is the total mass density associated with the α branch of the wave function.
The important point here is captured by Eq.(10.23), which says that the total mass
density can be broken apart into distinct pieces that (like the programs from different
TV channels that are being displayed simultaneously) each play out independently
of the others. In a sense, there is nothing new here compared to the way we were
thinking about Everett’s many-worlds proposal previously. The point is just that the
mass density ontology provides a deﬁnite, viable way of extracting, from the evolving
universal wave function , a coherent (many worlds!) story about physical goings-
on in ordinary three-dimensional space, i.e., this is a way to give a precise meaning
to the way we were already talking about Everett’s idea in earlier sections.

10.3 Ontology
289
A few contemporary proponents of the Everettian picture (for example, Lev
Vaidman) seem to basically understand the theory in this way. But for the most part,
Everett’s contemporary followers resist the idea that some special, explicit postulate
about the ontology of the theory is required.
The reason for this resistance is the idea that one of the main virtues of Everett’s
approach is its elegance, its parsimony: there is just the wave function, obeying
Schrödinger’s equation, full stop. This is supposed to be in contrast, for example, to
the pilot-wave picture, which followers of Everett would regard (because it posits
not only the wave function obeying Schrödinger’s equation, but in addition particles
moving in accordance with some further dynamical law) as ontologically cluttered
and cumbersome. That is, “wave function monism” – the idea that the wave function
is all there is – plays a very important role, for Everettians, in explaining and justifying
their preference for the Everettian theory.
One can indeed appreciate how an explicit endorsement of something like
Schrödinger’s mass density ontology – Eqs.(10.17) and (10.18) – would feel dan-
gerously and suspiciously similar to the pilot-wave theory’s explicit postulation of
additional ontology. But, of course, the problem is that it is very difﬁcult to understand
what to make of Everett’s theory if one just says “the wave function is everything”
and leaves it at that. Independent of whatever worries one might have about the many
worlds idea, such a position would mean that the theory suffers rather acutely from
the ontology problem we discussed in Chap.5.
So the problem faced by proponents of Everett’s theory is to, on the one hand,
avoid the ontology problem by ﬁnding some way of extracting, from the theory, an
explanation for our experience of material objects moving and interacting in three-
dimensional space, while at the same time avoiding the need to postulate additional
things, distinct from and additional to the wave function itself. One approach to
this problem has been to argue that familiar macroscopic structures in 3D can be
understood to emerge from the structure in the wave function, in the same way
that complicated macroscopic objects like, say, tigers can be understood as complex
macro-patterns of more basic ontological posits. As David Wallace elaborates,
It is simply untrue that any entity not directly represented in the basic axioms of our theory is
an illusion. Rather, science is replete with perfectly respectable entities which are nowhere to
be found in the underlying microphysics.... Tigers [for example] are (I take it!) unquestion-
ably real, objective physical objects, but the Standard Model [of particle physics] contains
quarks, electrons and the like, but no tigers. Instead, tigers should be understood as patterns,
or structures, within the states of that microphysical theory.... The moral of the story is: there
are structural facts about many microphysical systems which, although perfectly real and
objective (try telling a deer that a nearby tiger is not objectively real) simply cannot be seen
if we persist in describing those systems in purely microphysical language. Talk of zoology
is of course grounded in cell biology, and cell biology in molecular physics, but the entities
of zoology cannot be discarded in favour of the austere ontology of molecular physics alone.
Rather, those entities are structures instantiated within the molecular physics, and the task
of almost all science is to study structures of this kind [7].
The idea is that, in something like that same way, the ordinary world of macro-
scopic objects (including tables and chairs and planets and trees and cats and

290
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
human observers) is already there, instantiated within the complicated ripplings in
the structure of the universal wave function. In particular:
Structurally speaking, the dynamical behaviour of each wavepacket [i.e., each decoherent
branch of the wave function] is the same as the behaviour of a macroscopic classical system.
And if there are multiple wavepackets, the system is dynamically isomorphic to a collection
of independent classical systems [7].
That, I think, is exactly correct, but seems also to miss the point of the ontology
problem.
It is true that a relatively narrow and well-isolated wave packet propagating
through 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space is equivalent to an (approximate) tra-
jectory through 3N-dimensional conﬁguration space and hence, in turn, isomorphic
to (i.e., mathematically interchangeable with) a description of N particle trajectories
in 3-dimensional space, i.e., a classical system. But surely this mathematical isomor-
phism does not imply that the real physical existence of a propagating wave packet in
3N-dimensional space somehow brings about the additional real physical existence
of N particles moving and interacting in 3D. A single billiard ball, bouncing around
on a square two-dimensional billiards table, for example, is mathematically isomor-
phic to two beads (one small enough to pass through the hole of the other so they
don’t interact with each other) bouncing back and forth from the ends of a wire. Does
each really-existing billiard ball on a table thus somehow call into existence a pair
of beads on a wire somewhere? Nobody believes this, yet it seems like a perfectly
fair analogy to what would be required for a wavepacket in conﬁguration space to
genuinely give rise to a classical system of particles in three-dimensional, physical
space.
The sticking point is really the trans-dimensional character of the required sort of
emergence. If, for example, the fundamental quantum mechanical description were
in terms of N single-particle wave functions propagating in 3D space, there would be
no difﬁculty at all in understanding how a rough macroscopic description in terms of
atoms, molecules, and ultimately tigers, could be appropriate and entirely consistent
with that fundamental ontology. There is no problem, that is, in understanding how
something like a tiger can be understood as emerging from a fundamental ontol-
ogy involving waves. The problem is in understanding speciﬁcally how something
like a tiger (which is a certain complex pattern of microscopic goings-on in three-
dimensional space) could be understood as emerging from a fundamental ontology
involving only waves that live in an entirely different, much higher-dimensional
space.
Perhaps some ultimately-satisfying account of the needed sort of trans-
dimensional emergence could be given. Or perhaps this is the wrong way to think
about it. Wallace, for example, seems to have suggested that the very appearance that
we live in a three-dimensional world could itself be emergent:
Note ﬁrstly that the very assumption that a certain entity [namely, a certain branch of the
universal wave function] which is structurally like our world is not our world is manifestly
question-begging. How do we know that space is three-dimensional? We look around us.
How do we know that we are seeing something fundamental rather than emergent? We

10.3 Ontology
291
don’t; all of our observations ... are structural observations, and only the sort of a prioristic
knowledge now fundamentally discredited in philosophy could tell us more [7].
He means here that the idea that we live in a three-dimensional world should not
be taken as some kind of a priori dogma which has to appear, in stone, at the most
basic level. This, too, could be emergent from some very different more elementary
processes, as they appear to rough creatures like us. But (although Wallace would
certainly deny that this is an appropriate way to express it) there is a suggestion here
that the three-dimensionality of the world is then something like an illusion. And if
we can be deceived, through our ordinary direct perceptual experience of the world,
about something so basic as that, one worries that it might become difﬁcult to hold
off concerns about what else we might have been deluded about, and so why we
should believe the quantum formalism in the ﬁrst place.
Again, the goal here is not to resolve these issues, but to help make you aware of
their existence. Sufﬁce it, then, to note that (just as with “probability”), controversial
questions about ontology persist for Everett’s theory. Can the theory explain the
existence (or, at least, the appearance) of familiar three-dimensional material worlds
of the sort we ordinarily take ourselves to inhabit and of which, according to the
theory, there are actually many? And in particular, can it account for such worlds
exclusively on the basis of the universal wave function? The needed structures are
unquestionably present there – as shown by the possibility of understanding the
ontology in terms of Schrödinger’s mass density ﬁeld. But does the singling-out
of, for example, that particular bit of structure – as the thing we should look at
to understand what the theory says about goings-on in three-dimensional space –
constitute the postulation of additional ontology, beyond the wave function, as is
done unapologetically in the pilot-wave theory? If so, it is hard to understand why
one would not then just prefer to adopt the pilot-wave theory and skip the difﬁculties
(pertaining, for example, to “probability”) that arise due to the many-worlds character
of Everett’s theory. But if not, why only that particular structure? And are certain
things we took as basic facts about our world (like its three-dimensionality) then
rendered merely illusory, and, if so, is that even a problem?
These are some of the questions that would, I think, need to be addressed before
an Everettian theory could be considered to be as ontologically satisfactory as the
pilot-wave theory, or GRWm, or GRWf.
10.4
Locality
The question of whether Everett’s theory respects relativistic local causality is yet
another subtle and controversial one. Among the theory’s supporters, it is widely
believed that the theory is – uniquely among available options – locally causal. And
so this claim, that Everett’s theory is somehow uniquely compatible with relativity,
is a big part of the reason why the theory’s supporters support it.

292
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
The claim is generally based on two different lines of reasoning. The ﬁrst is that,
in ordinary quantum mechanics, the non-locality originated from the wave-function
collapse postulate. So, by retaining only (an appropriately relativistic generalization
of) the Schrödinger equation – i.e., by simply eliminating the collapse postulate from
the dynamics – Everett’s theory supposedly retains the local part, and abandons the
nonlocal part, of ordinary QM, and is therefore itself perfectly local.
The second line of reasoning addresses the question of how Everett’s theory
supposedly eludes Bell’s proof (discussed in Chap.8) that any empirically viable
theory must include nonlocal dynamics. The claim here is that Bell’s arguments
involve a previously-unacknowledged assumption which does not apply to Everett’s
theory – namely, Bell assumes that the spin measurements (made by Alice and Bob at
oppositeendsoftheexperimentalsetup)havedeﬁniteoutcomes.Thatis,Bellassumes
that, for each individual spin measurement, there is a particular unambiguous result
– the particle is either found spin up along the axis in question, or spin down. Bell’s
inequalityisthenaconstraintonthestatisticalcorrelationsthatarepossible,iflocality
is respected, within this set of unambiguous particular measurement outcomes. But,
the Everettians point out, it is simply not true in Everett’s theory that each individual
spin measurement has a single particular outcome; instead, there is a branching point
in the structure of the world and both “possible” outcomes are realized, one in each
branch.
It is certainly true that Bell wasn’t anticipating that kind of possibility and that
his theorem does indeed tacitly assume that experiments have particular, deﬁnite,
single realized outcomes. And there is some value in pointing out precisely how the
many-worlds theory manages to elude Bell’s general argument. But in a way it is
unnecessary to ask, of any extant candidate theory, whether and how Bell’s theorem
applies to it. (The use of Bell’s theorem is that it allows us to diagnose, as either
non-local or in conﬂict with the experimental facts, all of the non-extant theories –
the theories that nobody has managed or bothered to think of yet.) We can instead
assess the theory’s status vis-a-vis locality directly, by just seeing whether or not the
theory respects our explicitly formulated notion of locality from Chap.1.
When we attempt to do this for Everett’s theory, however, we immediately realize
that the difﬁculties we reviewed in the last two sections – pertaining to the ontology
of the theory and the role and meaning of probability within it – preclude anything
like a straightforward diagnosis. If, for example, we understand the theory as positing
the existence of nothing but the wave function – thought of as a kind of ﬁeld in a 3N-
dimensional abstract space, and with the appearance of three-dimensionality being
some kind of emergent delusion within our conscious experiences – then it will be
completely impossible to say anything meaningful about whether the theory does
or does not respect locality. Locality, remember, is the idea that causal inﬂuences
between physically real objects in ordinary 3-dimensional space never propagate
faster than the speed of light. If, according to a theory, there are no physically real
objects in ordinary 3-dimensional space, then concepts like “local” and “non-local”
are simply, radically, fatally, inapplicable. The theory, so understood, would be “not
even non-local” in precisely the sense introduced back in Chap.5.

10.4 Locality
293
Of course, this is just an extreme example, intended to make a pedagogical
point. Probably no actual proponent of Everett’s theory would endorse the perspec-
tive described in the previous paragraph. Still, it is a crucial and under-appreciated
point that a theory has to clearly articulate an ontology of physical objects in three-
dimensional space (and, if that ontology is not openly posited like the particles of
the pilot-wave theory, must explain clearly how the ontology of physical objects in
three-dimensional space relates to and emerges from whatever is openly posited)
before the theory’s status vis-a-vis local causality can be meaningfully assessed.
Ambiguities surrounding the concept of “probability” also prevent a straightfor-
ward application, to Everett’s theory, of Bell’s formulation of locality. Recall that,
in Bell’s formulation, “locality” was the requirement that the probability assigned to
each event in space-time, conditioned on a complete description of events in a slice
across the past light cone, should be independent of events with suitable space-like
separation. In earlier chapters, we have always been concerned in particular with
events that correspond to deﬁnite, observable occurrences such as a certain experi-
ment having a particular outcome. Such events can of course still be said to occur
in Everett’s theory, but (what would previously have been described as) the different
possibilities are not related to one another in the familiar way in Everett’s theory,
and this undermines and obscures the applicability of certain probabilistic ideas.
For example, it would normally be assumed that, since a given spin measurement
on a spin-1/2 particle has two possible outcomes, two probabilities like P(up|λ)
and P(down|λ) – where “up” and “down” mean, respectively, that the “spin-up” and
“spin-down” outcomes are manifested in the macroscopic ontology in the appropriate
space-time region – should sum to 100%:
P(up|λ) + P(down|λ) = 1.
(10.25)
But, in the context of Everett’s theory, each of these probabilities is (for generic λ)
already 100%: both outcomes will, with certainty, be instantiated, right on top of one
another, in the appropriate space-time region. Thus, for Everett:
P(up|λ) + P(down|λ) = 2.
(10.26)
This illustrates the sense in which certain basic assumptions about how probabilities
work – having to do with the mutual exclusivity of the possibilities to which we
conventionally assign probabilities – take a very different form in the context of
Everett’s theory and thus prevent certain probability assignments from working in
the familiar ways.
In any case, you can perhaps begin to see why the question of whether the many
worlds theory is local, is a subtle and controversial one. Not only is the many-worlds
character of the theory weird in a profound and radical way (so that normal everyday
assumptions, like that experiments always have deﬁnite speciﬁc outcomes, as well
as more technical assumptions like that the probabilities associated with what we
normally think of as distinct possible outcomes should sum to one, fail to apply),
but it also remains very obscure how/whether the theory’s postulates relate to and/or

294
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
account for and/or give rise to physical objects and process in ordinary 3-dimensional
physical space.
Still, let us attempt to set these abstract worries aside, and get a concrete feeling
for how the many worlds theory talks about one of the example situations we’ve used
to discuss the non-locality of other theories.
To make things as deﬁnite as possible, we’ll consider a version of the theory
in which a mass density ﬁeld ρ(⃗x, t) is explicitly postulated as the way to under-
stand what 3-space ontology the wave function is describing. And let’s analyze the
Einstein’s Boxes scenario from the point of view of this version of the theory. Sup-
pose, then, that there is a single particle, split between two “half boxes” located at
widely separate locations. Suppose further that Alice is stationed near the half-box
on the left and decides to implement, at t = 0, a measurement to see whether or not
the particle is contained in her half box; the measurement outcome is registered on a
pointer which swings to the right by some distance d if the particle is detected, and
stays stationary if the particle is not detected. Meanwhile, Bob is stationed near the
half-box on the right and also decides to implement, at t = 0, a similar measurement.
Thus, prior to t = 0, the wave function for the particle-and-two-pointers system can
be written
(x, y, z) =
1
√
2
[ψL(x) + ψR(x)] φ0(y)χ0(z)
(10.27)
where ψL/R(x) are wave functions with support exclusively in the left/right half-
boxes, and φ0(y) and χ0(z) are narrow wave packets centered at y = 0 and z = 0,
the undeﬂected “ready” positions of the two pointers. The mass density ρ associated
with this wave function will have contributions at the undeﬂected positions of the
two pointers and will also involve half of the split particle’s worth of mass density
in each of the half boxes.
After t = 0, when both measurements have gone to completion, the wave function
will evolve into
(x, y, z) =
1
√
2
[ψL(x) φ0(y −d) χ0(z) + ψR(x) φ0(y) χ0(z −d)]
(10.28)
which is a superposition of two terms: one in which the particle is on the left, the
pointer on the left has deﬂected (indicating that the particle was detected there),
and the pointer on the right remains undeﬂected (indicating that the particle was
not detected there) – and another in which the particle is on the right, the pointer
on the left has not deﬂected (indicating that the particle was not detected there)
and the pointer on the right has deﬂected (indicating that the particle was detected
there). These two terms are well-separated in conﬁguration space (especially when
one remembers that our schematic degrees of freedom y and z are really proxies
for some huge macroscopic number of individual particle positions) and so the two
terms can be understood as describing distinct, no-longer-interacting worlds.
The mass density is then simply the sum of the individually reasonable mass
densities associated with each individual world. That is, ρ = ρ1 + ρ2 where ρ1 has

10.4 Locality
295
the mass density associated with the particle being contained exclusively in the left
box, Alice’s pointer having swung to the right indicating that the particle is there
on the left, and Bob’s pointer remaining in its undeﬂected position... and where ρ2
instead has the mass density associated with the particle being contained exclusively
in the right box, Alice’s pointer remaining in its undeﬂected position, and Bob’s
pointer having swung to the right indicating that the particle is there on the right. See
Fig.10.5 for a sketch of how the mass density evolves during the process.
As shown in the Figure, from this “God’s eye” perspective, nothing particularly
dramatic happens here and there isn’t much of a suggestion of nonlocality. The mass
density associated with the particle-in-the-two-half-boxes is initially split between
the two half-boxes and the pointers are both sitting in their ready positions. Then,
as the interactions proceed around t = 0, the mass density associated with the two
pointers splits in half so that both pointers now have “split” positions in the same way
that the particle did initially. It perhaps seems plausible to say that Alice’s pointer
splits into these two different positions in response to the (purely local) fact that the
particle is only half-contained in her half-box, and similarly for Bob’s pointer. And
so it may seem plausible to say that (weird though the many-worlds character here
may be, with each pointer pointing to two different positions!) there is not really any
suggestion of nonlocality here.
But this appearance is somewhat misleading since there are relational facts about
the various pieces of mass density which are not captured in Fig.10.5. In particular,

Fig. 10.5 Alice and Bob perform simultaneous measurements to detect the presence of a particle
which is initially “split” between their two locations. Alice’s and Bob’s pointers are initially in their
undeﬂected, “ready” positions, and the mass density associated with the particle is split between
the two half-boxes. After t = 0, when both Alice and Bob each initiate an interaction which causes
their pointer to deﬂect if the particle is present in their half-box, the two pointers “split”, with half of
each pointer’s mass density remaining in the undeﬂected position (indicating the non-detection of
the particle) and the other half of each pointer’s mass density deﬂecting to the right (indicating the
successful detection of the particle). Overall, it perhaps appears that there is no hint of nonlocality
here: Alice’s choice to initiate a measurement procedure causes her pointer (and shortly thereafter,
her self!) to split, and similarly for Bob and his pointer, and the contents of the two half-boxes never
change and hence appear unaffected by any of the measurements, distant or otherwise

296
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
there are facts, implied by Eq.(10.28), about which pieces of mass density are in the
same world – the same branch – as each other. Remember here that the decomposition
of the total mass density ﬁeld ρ into the sum, ρ1 + ρ2, is robustly implied by the
fact that the wave function is itself the sum of two disjoint terms, i.e., the two terms
which are extremely well-separated in conﬁguration space. So the very fundamental
concept of Everett’s theory not just allows, but requires, us to consider the separate
branch-identities of these terms. See Fig.10.6 for an attempt to visualize the same
process again, but now including these relational facts about which pieces of mass
density are “in the same universe as” which other pieces.
The point of this further elaboration is to stress the following: it is not the case that
Alice’s measurement merely causes a “local splitting” of her pointer and her self,
with Bob’s measurement also causing a second, independent, “local splitting” of his
pointer and his self. If the two splittings were independent in this sense, you would
expect that, if for example Alice and Bob get together later in the day to compare
notes on the outcomes of their experiments, the interaction between the two Alices
and the two Bobs would generate four branches: (i) one in which “yes-Alice” (i.e.,
the Alice who detected that the particle was present at her location) meets “yes-Bob”;
(ii) one in which “yes-Alice” meets “no-Bob”; (iii) one in which “no-Alice” meets

Fig. 10.6 Same as Fig.10.5 but with the various contributions to the mass density ρ now marked to
indicate the splitting into two distinct worlds or branches: The down-to-the-right striping indicates
the world in which the particle is found on the left, by Alice, while the up-to-the-right striping
indicates the world in which the particle is found on the right, by Bob. (Note that, prior to the
measurements, the mass density associated with the particle is not identiﬁed with one or the other
of these worlds, even though there would be a rather obvious way of doing this and it wouldn’t be
terribly misleading to do it. The reason is that, as long as the splitting of the wave function into two
terms remains based on a purely microscopic difference, we don’t really have separate worlds at
all, in Everett’s sense. (This is immaterial as long as Alice and Bob are inevitably going to carry
out their measurements as we have been describing. But in principle, prior to their doing this, they
could decide instead to bring the two half-boxes back together in the middle and perform some
kind of interference experiment instead, and we would expect that they would indeed be able to
see interference. This remains a possibility precisely because no actual branching in Everett’s sense
occurs until a more macroscopic number of degrees of freedom is involved in the decomposition
of the wave function into disjoint terms

10.4 Locality
297
“yes-Bob”; and (iv) one in which “no-Alice” meets “no-Bob”. But this is not right.
There will not be a branch in which “yes-Alice” meets “yes-Bob” and there will not
be a branch in which “no-Alice” meets “no-Bob”. Only branches (ii) and (iii) will
actually exist later, if Alice and Bob get together to chat, because already, after they
have each completed their measurements but not yet gotten together to chat, there
are just two distinct worlds.
This is inherent in the mathematical structure of the wave function even though
it does not appear in the mass density ﬁeld ρ. In general, it should be clear that, in
using  to compute ρ, we lose (by integrating) a lot of information. (Remember the
examples, from Chap.5, of very different wave functions which all produce the same
mass density ﬁelds.) So while ρ is supposed, on this understanding of Everett’s theory,
to tell us what is going on in 3D physical space, there is in some sense much more
that is true about goings on in physical space than is contained in the mass density
ﬁeld. In particular, as we are seeing here, there are relational facts – about which
contributions to the mass ﬁeld are in the same world as which other contributions –
that really exist and have dynamical implications for how events will play out in the
future as different sub-systems continue to interact with one another.
For our example here, the situation seems to be as follows. Alice’s measurement of
the contents of her half-box induce a splitting; she has two descendants, one of whom
(“yes-Alice”) sees the particle in her half-box and the other of whom (“no-Alice”)
fails to see the particle. Simultaneously, but at a distant location, Bob’s measurement
induces another splitting, and he too has two descendants, one of whom (“yes-Bob”)
sees and one of whom (“no-Bob”) fails to see the particle in his half-box. But the two
splittings are correlated despite their spatial separation: “yes-Alice” and “no-Bob”
are, so to speak, born into the same post-measurement world, and “no-Alice” and
“yes-Bob” are also born into the same post-measurement world. These spatially-
separated birthings are correlated in a way that seems impossible to understand in
any purely local way.
That said, I do not think it is possible to really argue cleanly, the way we have
done for both the pilot-wave and spontaneous collapse theories, that there is an
unambiguous violation of Bell’s formulation of local causality. This is partly because
that formulationis built aroundtheconcept of probability(it demands, remember, that
a certain probability not change when distant events are speciﬁed) and the question
about how to understand the usual quantum mechanical probabilities in the context
of Everett’s many worlds theory remains rather murky. It is also in part a result of the
murkiness of theontologypositedbythetheory. Thinkinginterms of themass density
ontology at least gives us something reasonably clear that we can draw pictures of
and think about (even though it is perhaps somewhat contrary to the Everettian spirit
of insisting that the wave function alone, evolving in accordance with Schrödinger’s
equation always, is sufﬁcient). But things still remain murky, with the intuitive non-
locality somehow being associated with the relational facts which are not captured
by the mass ﬁeld.
And so the conclusion of this discussion will, unfortunately, but like our discus-
sions of Probability and Ontology, be somewhat anti-climactic. It simply is not clear,
in the context of Everett’s version of quantum theory, how we should understand and

298
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
formulate the concept of “local causality”, whether we should think of the theory as
local or non-local, or, indeed, whether we should care about whether the theory is in
some sense local or not. (Note that the closely related – but, as we saw in Chap.9,
not identical – question of the theory’s compatibility with fundamental relativity also
remains, I think, an open question.)
By way of bringing our discussion of the many-worlds theory to a close, I think
it is helpful to acknowledge the truly shocking nature of the idea, in Bryce de Witt’s
description, that the
...universe is constantly splitting into a stupendous number of branches, all resulting from
the measurementlike interactions between its myriad components. Moreover, every quantum
transition taking place on every star, in every galaxy, in every remote corner of the universe
is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies of itself [8].
As de Witt continues:
I still recall vividly the shock I experienced on ﬁrst encountering this multiworld concept.
The idea of 10100+ slightly imperfect copies of oneself all constantly splitting into further
copies, which ultimately become unrecognizable, is not easy to reconcile with common
sense. Here is schizophrenia with a vengeance [8].
I think it should be admitted, however, that although our intuitions recoil at this sug-
gestion, the picture is compelling and elegant as an approach to addressing the mea-
surement problem of ordinary quantum mechanics, and should be regarded (despite
its initially shocking character!) as seemingly compatible with experience.
On the other hand, I think it must also be admitted that the theory does not yet
provide sufﬁcient clarity regarding the several issues we focused on in this chapter
– probability, ontology, and locality – and that it therefore remains impossible to
assess in anything like a ﬁnal or conclusive way. It remains, to a greater extent than
the pilot-wave theory or the spontaneous collapse theories, a work-in-progress.
Projects:
10.1 According to Everett’s theory, if your friend measures the z-component of
the spin of a spin-1/2 particle that is initially in the state ψ+x, he gets into an
entangled superposition (with the spin-1/2 particle and the measuring equip-
ment) in which he experiences, in some sense, both outcomes: spin-up and
spin-down. So, how will your friend respond if you ask him which outcome
he experienced? Explain.
10.2 True or false: according to Everett’s theory, matter is made of particles.
Explain.
10.3 Suppose a measurement of the energy of a particle-in-a-box produces the joint

ψ(x, y) =

[ψ1(x)φ1(y) + ψ2(x)φ2(y)]
(10.29)
where ψn(x) is the nth energy eigenstate for the PIB and φn(y) is a pointer

outcome for the energy measurement. What is the state of the pointer relative
to the PIB having state ψ1(x)? What is the state of the PIB relative to the
pointer having state φ2(y)? What is the state of the pointer relative to the PIB
having state

√
2 [ψ1(x) + ψ2(x)]?
10.4 It was claimed in Sect.2 that, if the worlds are appropriately weighted in the
counting, we can still say that the overwhelming number of worlds display
outcome statistics that are compatible with the Born rule. Show in particu-
lar that, if Eqs.(10.9) and (10.13) are plugged into Eq.(10.14), the resulting
function f w
N (n) does indeed peak at n = Np. (Hint: set d/dn of ln[ f ] to zero,
and use the Stirling approximation, ln(m!) ≈m ln(m).)
10.5 Consider the case of N = 4 “quantum coin ﬂips”, as discussed in Sect.10.2,
but with the branch weight for the H outcomes being p = 3/4. There is
one world in which the sequence H H H H is observed; its weighted world-
fraction is therefore f w(4) = 1 × (3/4)4 ≈0.316. Calculate in a similar way
f w(n) for n = 0, 1, 2, and 3. Which value of n produces the largest weighted
world-count? Is this what you would expect?
10.6 Suppose an observer measures some quantity (on a system that is not initially
in an eigenstate for that quantity), and then subsequently re-measures the same
quantity again, but using a different measuring apparatus. (Thus, there will be
three degrees of freedom involved – say, “x” for the system whose property
is being measured, “y” for the position of the pointer of the ﬁrst measuring
apparatus, and “z” for the position of the pointer of the second measuring
apparatus.) Will the results of the two measurements agree in each branch of
the wave function, or will there be some branches (i.e., some worlds) in which
the measurements disagree? Explain how this relates to the collapse postulate
of ordinary QM.
10.7 Suppose a spin-1/2 particle is in the state ψ+z. First its z-spin is measured, then
its x-spin is measured, and then its z-spin is measured again. Will the results
of the two z-spin measurements agree in each branch of the wave function, or
will there be some branches (i.e., some worlds) in which the measurements
disagree? Explain how this relates to the collapse postulate of ordinary QM.
10.8 Imagine that you live in Everett’s universe and are about to perform a biased
quantum coin ﬂip with p = 3/4. Explain what is problematic with each of the
following statements you might consider making: (i) “The probability that I
will see H is 3/4.” (ii) “Of all my descendants, the probability that the one
who is really me sees H is 3/4.” (iii) “There will be descendants in branches
with all possible outcomes, but the probability that I will end up experiencing
a branch with outcome H is 3/4.” Can you construct a similar statement,
assigning a 3/4 probability to something, that would actually make sense in
the Everettian point of view?
10.9 In Everett’s 1957 paper, Ref. [3], he gives the following derivation of the
branch weighting rule. The goal is to ﬁnd a function w which assigns weights
to the different terms in ψ = 	
i ciψi. If the individual factors ψi are properly
normalized, then the weight assigned to a given term can only depend on

300
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
the complex number ci. But a pure phase can be absorbed into the states
ψi, so that the weight function should only depend on the modulus of the
expansion coefﬁcients: w (ci) = w (|ci|). Now, with further time-evolution,
the nth branch will split into additional sub-branches: cnψn = 	
j a jφ j.
Assuming again that all the states (ψn and the φ j) are properly normalized,
this implies |cn|2 = 	
j |a j|2. Now, If we require that this further splitting
preserves the total weight of the involved branches, we have
w(cn) =

j
w(a j).
(10.30)
Everett calls this the “additivity requirement”. Using the above, it implies
w
⎛
⎝

j
|a j|2
⎞
⎠=

j
w

|a j|

(10.31)
which implies that w(x) = cx2 for some constant c that will be 1 if the total
weight is normalized to 1. To see this, Everett suggests deﬁning a new function
g(x) = w(√x), in terms of which the previous equation reads:
g
⎛
⎝
j
|a j|2
⎞
⎠=

j
g

|a j|2
.
(10.32)
One can see that this requires g(x) = cx. Fill in the gaps in the mathematics
and reasoning here to make the argument fully clear. Then assess it. What,
exactly, does it prove in the context of Everett’s theory? Does the argument
completely remove the circularity alluded to in the text?
10.10 In our preliminary discussion of the Einstein’s Boxes scenario, depicted in
Fig.10.5, we said that “it perhaps appears that there is no hint of nonlocality
here”. Make this a little more formal by applying our modiﬁcation of Bell’s
locality condition from Chap.1, Eq.1.28. Let χ1 denote, say, the presence
of a nonzero mass density, for the Left Pointer, at its undeﬂected position
(after the measurement has gone to completion). And let χ2 and χ′
2 represent,
respectively, nonzero mass densities, for the Right Pointer, at its undeﬂected
and deﬂected positions. (C here just includes everything that was true prior
to t = 0.) Show that the condition is formally respected.
10.11 The attitude of Everettians toward the issue of quantum non-locality is pretty-
well captured by Everett’s comments from 1957: “Consider the case where the
states of two object systems are correlated, but where the two systems do not
interact. Let one observer perform a speciﬁed observation on the ﬁrst system,
then let another observer perform an observation on the second system, and
ﬁnally let the ﬁrst observer repeat his observation. Then it is found that the ﬁrst
observer always [i.e., in each branch] gets the same result both times, and the

10.4 Locality
301
observation by the second observer has no effect whatsoever on the outcome
of the ﬁrst’s observations. Fictitious paradoxes like that of Einstein, Podolsky,
and Rosen which are concerned with such correlated, noninteracting systems
are easily investigated and clariﬁed in the present scheme.” [3] Why do you
think Everett calls the EPR paradox “ﬁctitious”? Explain how you understand
Everett to be thinking about this kind of situation. Do you agree that there is
just clearly nothing non-local going on here, according to the Everett theory,
such that it makes sense to call EPR’s suggestion of non-locality “ﬁctitious”?
Explain.
10.12 Everettians, starting with David Deutsch, have accused the pilot-wave theory
of being a “parallel universe theor[y] in a state of chronic denial [9].” The
basis for this accusation is the fact that the pilot-wave theory also has the
wave function of the universe obeying Schrödinger’s equation all the time.
So the many-worlds structure that Everettians ﬁnd in that wave function is,
they argue, just as present in that wave function in the pilot-wave picture, as it
is in the wave-function monist Everettian picture. What do you make of this
accusation? How do you think a proponent of the pilot-wave theory would or
should respond?
10.13 Tim Maudlin pointed out in Ref. [10] that GRWm (but, interestingly, not
GRWf) also has a kind of many-worlds character: since the GRW localizations
involve multiplication by a Gaussian function which is small (but never quite
zero) far from the Gaussian’s center, the mass density ﬁeld associated with the
“un-selected” branches of the wave function is, while very small compared
to the “selected” branch, not zero. What do you think? Is GRWm really a
single-universe theory (because those other, “un-selected” worlds are so dim
that it is reasonable to ignore them), or is it really a many-worlds theory in
denial (because, dim or not, and anyway the dimness isn’t visible from the
inside, those “un-selected” worlds have all the right structure to count as real
worlds)?
10.14 Proponents and critics of Everett’s theory both sometimes appeal to Occam’s
razor in support of their position. The proponents say that, because the the-
ory dispenses with the measurement axioms of ordinary QM (and because it
doesn’t replace those with anything like additional dynamical laws for “hid-
den variables”), Everettism is by far the simplest, most parsimonious version
of quantum theory. On the other hand critics say that Everett’s worldview,
with the huge number of “parallel universes” that are totally unobservable
to us, is ridiculously extravagant. Explain precisely how each side interprets
and applies Occam’s razor, i.e., explain what leads the two sides to these two
opposite conclusions even though they are allegedly appealing to the same
criterion. What do you think? Is Everett’s theory clean and elegant, or ugly
and complicated?
10.15 David Deutsch has argued that evidence for an Everettian multiplicity of
universes is ubiquitous:

302
10
The Many-Worlds Theory
The point that theorists tend to miss is that the multiplicity of reality is not only, or
even primarily, a consequence of quantum theory. It is quite simply an observed fact.
Any interference experiment (such as the two-slit experiment), when performed with
individual particles one at a time, has no known interpretation in which the particle we
see is the only physical entity passing through the apparatus. We know that the invisible
entities passing through obey the same phenomenological equations of motion ... as the
single particle we do see. And we know from [EPR] type experiments, such as that of
Aspect, that these not-directly-perceptible particles are arranged in extended ‘layers’
each of which behaves internally like an approximately classical universe. Admittedly
all these observations detect other universes only indirectly. But then we can detect
pterodactyls and quarks only indirectly too. The evidence that other universes exist is
at least as strong as the evidence for pterodactyls or quarks [9].
What do you think of this argument? Is there really no single-universe theory
that can explain the results of the double-slit experiment?
10.16 In the last section of Chap.9, we saw that certain regions of the {λ, σ} para-
meter space for spontaneous collapse theories were empirically refuted, and
certain other regions were considered “Perceptually/Philosophically Unsatis-
factory”. The many-worlds theory can be thought of as a spontaneous collapse
theory, but with collapse rate λ = 0. So is the many-worlds theory “Perceptu-
ally/Philosophically Unsatisfactory”? Explain the assumption that is made in
diagnosing small-λ versions of spontaneous collapse theory as unsatisfactory,
and how Everett would challenge this assumption.

Afterword
In December of 1923, shortly after completing his PhD in the physics department
at Harvard, the promising young Illinois native John Slater traveled to Copenhagen
to conduct post-doctoral research with Niels Bohr and Bohr’s close associate Hans
Kramers. Slater had read Bohr’s early papers on atomic models and been impressed
by them: “I liked the way in which [Bohr] would go straight to the physical side of
things instead of wrapping it up in a great deal of mathematics,” Slater would explain
much later in an archival interview conducted by Thomas Kuhn. “I felt that he must
understand the physics of it quite well [1].”
Slater was particularly interested in the interaction of matter and radiation and
was particularly struck by the mounting experimental evidence for Einstein’s light
quantum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of photons. Upon arriving in Copenhagen,
Slater was contemplating a pilot-wave type model, in which real photon particles
would be guided by a wave obeying Maxwell’s equations: “I wanted to see how
deﬁnite one could get in tying together the ﬁelds and the photons [1].”
But Bohr and Kramers turned out to be quite hostile to the majority of – and
certainly the spirit of – Slater’s ideas. The three ended up co-authoring a paper
(which was inﬂuential despite turning out to be completely wrong) that jumped
off from some of Slater’s ideas about matter-radiation interaction, but contradicted,
for example, Slater’s picture of real, “deﬁnite” photons, and Slater’s principle of
strict energy conservation. As Slater would later admit, though, “those papers were
dictated by Bohr and Kramers very much against my wishes. I fought with them so
seriously that I’ve never had any respect for those people since. I had a horrible time
in Copenhagen [1].”
As Slater elaborated:
I went there. Bohr was very nice, he invited me to Christmas dinner, I told him about my
ideas, he felt these were ﬁne, ‘But, you see, they’re much too deﬁnite. Now we cannot have
this exact conservation. We must not think too speciﬁcally about the photons. We don’t have
photons like that.’ In other words, [Bohr] wanted to make the whole thing just as vague as
he could [1].
Undoubtedly this was neither the ﬁrst nor the last time that a relatively young scientist
has felt pressured – even railroaded – by more senior colleagues. But what I ﬁnd

Afterword
particularly interesting about this episode is not what felt to Slater like rude or even
professionally inappropriate behavior on the part of Bohr and Kramers, but instead
the philosophical disconnect that seemingly prevented them from agreeing about
how best to proceed with the physics.
Slater, for his part, reported that he was not dogmatically attached to the idea of
deﬁnite photons:
... I was willing to knock the photons.... but I wanted to put these ideas together and get
something more deﬁnite about it. That was when I was working on [a paper which ended up
with the title] ‘A quantum theory of optical phenomena’. I wanted to start working on that.
I always approach a problem in the sense of wanting to be able to make it deﬁnite and work
out the details. I feel that if you can’t work out the details you can’t be sure it’s right. I have
a great distrust of the hand-waving approach to anything. I had supposed, when I went to
Copenhagen, that although Bohr’s papers looked like hand-waving, they were just covering
up all the mathematics and careful thought that had gone on underneath.
The thing I convinced myself of after a month, was that there was nothing underneath. It
was all just hand-waving. I just said ‘I’m not going to content myself with this. I’m going
to go ahead and see if I can’t work out a physical picture ... which at least would show that
these ideas can be made to hang together logically.
So I tried to see if any set of hypotheses could be hung together that would be somewhat
logical. I think that the ﬁnal result was that I could do this. Well, I was working on that. Bohr
was contemptuous of it. He would have nothing whatever to do with it. He said he wasn’t
interested in looking at it or anything like it. Same way with Kramers. They just had no use
whatever for this. So I decided I had no use whatever for being around them, [and] I went
away. And I’ve never had any respect for Mr. Bohr since [1].
Finally, in a statement that I decided to open this book with because I regard it as
perfectly and beautifully capturing the attitude that sensible physicists should have
to the Copenhagen philosophy, Slater noted:
Bohr always would go in for this remark, ‘You cannot really explain it in the framework of
space and time.’ By God, I was determined I was going to explain it in the framework of
space and time.
In other words, that was Bohr’s point of view on everything, and that was the fundamental
difference of opinion between us.... Bohr was fundamentally of a mystical turn of mind and
I’m fundamentally of a matter-of-fact turn of mind [1].
Despite – or perhaps in part because of – his frustrations with Bohr and his early
departure from Copenhagen, Slater went on to have a long and distinguished career,
making major contributions across many decades in atomic, molecular, and solid-
state physics.
I ﬁnd Slater’s story at once tragic and refreshing – tragic in the sense that unques-
tionably progress in fundamental physics was stiﬂed by the Copenhagen philoso-
phy, which surely turned off, in addition to Slater, other promising researchers with
“matter-of-fact turn[s] of mind” – but also refreshing to know that Schrödinger and
Einstein were not the only voices of dissent against the rising tide of Copenhagen
orthodoxy.
That tide did rise. As the Nobel prize-winner Murray Gell-Mann would note:
“Niels Bohr brainwashed a whole generation of theorists into thinking that the job

Afterword
305
(of ﬁnding an adequate presentation of quantum mechanics) was done ﬁfty years ago
[2].”
But happily that tide is now in the process of receding. Many physicists continue
to pay superﬁcial lip-service to the Copenhagen interpretation, but this is really just
a result of inertia. Very few physicists (and even fewer philosophers of physics)
who are actually interested in foundational questions in quantum mechanics – and,
thankfully, this is an increasing number due to the recent explosion of interest in
novel technological applications of fundamental quantum mechanical principles –
take the Copenhagen approach seriously. It is increasingly recognized as, in essence,
what Slater pegged it as from the very beginning: a lot of vague and philosophical
hand-waving intended to paper over the failure to “explain [things] in the framework
of space and time [1].”
I hope that this book has helped encourage readers to adopt Slater’s attitude.
In particular, I hope that an increased familiarity with the pilot-wave, spontaneous
collapse, and many-worlds pictures will give today’s promising young physicists a
clearer sense of what is possible so that they feel conﬁdent in demanding more –
more, that is, than Bohr thought possible – from microphysics going forward.
Regarding this menu of currently-available options for understanding quantum
theory, I have to agree with Bell’s assessment that “the pilot wave picture undoubt-
edly shows the best craftsmanship among the pictures we have considered [3].” Its
apparent incompatibility with relativity is indeed troubling. However, Bell’s the-
orem and the associated experiments seem to reveal that the pilot-wave theory’s
non-locality is a reﬂection of a genuine feature of the world, rather than a disqualify-
ing ﬂaw. On the other hand, there are hints that the required sort of non-locality could
be more plausibly uniﬁed with fundamental relativity in the context of spontaneous
collapse theories. And some still hold out hope that the many-worlds theory will
show that even non-locality is not required. But still, despite the difﬁculty with rela-
tivity, it is hard not to view the pilot-wave theory as the most plausible and promising
currently-available option, compared to the relatively contrived and ad hoc sponta-
neous collapse theories and the many-worlds theory with its sprawling difﬁculties
with probability and ontology.
My ﬁrst major hope for this book, though, is not to convert people into proponents
of the pilot-wave theory; instead my hope is simply to help people understand that
the common aspiration of the pilot-wave, spontaneous collapse, and many-worlds
theories – namely, to give a uniform and coherent account of physics from the micro-
scopic to the macroscopic scales – is attainable.
Bell’stheorem–theconﬂictbetweenanysuchcoherentaccountandtherelativistic
notion of local causality – remains very troubling. My second major hope for this
book is thus to help people appreciate that, while it is not terribly difﬁcult to achieve
a realistic picture of the quantum realm, it is rather difﬁcult to unify these pictures
with a similarly-realistic understanding of relativity theory. It is tragic that, more
than 50 years after Bell’s discovery, so many physicists remain unaware of this
major challenge. One strongly suspects that several more widely-known theoretical
challenges (such as unifying general relativity with relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory)

306
Afterword
might be related to this largely-unrecognized one. More attention and more creativity
are needed on this and many other related issues.
I hope the book has established a fertile base from which to further explore
foundational questions in quantum physics. To help you get started, I thought I
could close the book by suggesting some possible directions and topics for further
study and research.
One obvious possibility is to learn more about one of the theories that was intro-
duced in this book:
• For the pilot-wave theory, there are interesting questions about how the “quantum
equilibrium hypothesis” – which ensures consistency with the Born rule statistics
of ordinary QM – should be undestood, derived, and explained. Important entries
into the literature include Refs. [4–6]. There has also been interesting work on
relativistic extensions of the pilot-wave picture; see, for example, Refs. [7–9].
Finally there are interesting questions, related to the discussions in our Chap.5,
about how to understand the wave function in the context of the pilot-wave theory.
References [10, 11] provide two contrasting perspectives.
• Important recent work on the spontaneous collapse theories includes the relativistic
formulations of GRWf [12] and GRWm [13], and a precise formalization of the
phenomenological implications of GRW [14]. Reference [15] provides a recent
and systematic review of collapse models and the ongoing attempts to constrain
them experimentally. On the more philosophical side, David Albert’s book – which
argues that spontaneous collapse theories may shed novel light on problems in the
foundations of statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, and cosmology – is also
noteworthy [16].
• The recent resurgence of popularity in Everett’s many-worlds theory, by both
physicists (especially cosmologists) and philosophers of science, has produced a
broad literature. Everettians’ recent attempts to address the problem of understand-
ing and explaining the Born rule quantum probabilities are especially important.
David Wallace’s essay “How to prove the Born rule” is particularly noteworthy
in a collection of very high-quality papers about the physics and philosophy of
Everett’s theory, Ref. [17]. (References [18, 19] also provide useful overviews.)
With the possible exception of Ref. [20], Ref. [21] seems to remain the state-of-
the-art when it comes to the relationship between Everett’s theory and the ontology
problem. On the more pure physics side, Max Tegmark has reviewed the Everett
interpretation and its relationship to other, especially cosmological, notions of
many- or parallel- universes [22].
Debates in the foundations of quantum mechanics sometimes appear as endless parti-
san squabbling between dogmatically-committed proponents of different viewpoints,
none of whose minds are ever changed. Still, in addition to learning how proponents
of different theories describe and develop their favored perspectives, it can be valu-
able to understand the criticisms that proponents of one theory level against its rivals.
Noteworthy examples here include an Everettian critique of the pilot-wave theory by
Brown and Wallace [23], replies (defending the pilot-wave perspective) by Maudlin
and Valentini (and Brown’s reply to Valentini’s reply) in Ref. [17]. J. Bricmont, a

Afterword
307
defender of the pilot-wave theory, has made a number of sharp criticisms of the
spontaneous collapse and many-worlds theories in Ref. [24].
There also exist, of course, many other “interpretations” of quantum mechanics
that were (undoubtedly to the great annoyance of their defenders) not included in
this book. That is, of course, because I view them as less worthwhile. But there
may be value in exploring them nevertheless. Reference [25] provides an accessi-
ble introduction, by a critic, to the “consistent histories” interpretation (which can
be understood as a more formal and modernized version of the Copenhagen inter-
pretation) in relation to two of the theories included in this book; some accessible
presentations by one of the theory’s defenders are collected in Ref. [26]. A rather
different attempt to modernize the Copenhagen interpretation is so-called “QBism”
(which at least at one point stood for Quantum Bayesianism); see Ref. [27] for an
accessible introduction. A completely different idea is that virtually everything that
is puzzling or problematic about quantum mechanics disappears if only we allow
for the possibility of backwards-in-time causal inﬂuences; see Ref. [28] for a recent
overview and Ref. [29] for an older but more formally developed proposal. There
are of course many others as well, but these tend to be closely related to one of
the perspectives already mentioned, or to have a very dubious status, or both. The
Wikipedia page on “Interpretations of quantum mechanics” seems to contain a fairly
complete list.
Some important recent developments have been spurred by a viewpoint which is
not exactly a candidate theory, but more an open-ended category of possible theories:
the “ψ-epistemic” viewpoint according to which the quantum wave function should
be understood as describing our incomplete knowledge of physical states, rather than
the physical states themselves. (Something in this vicinity was, of course, Einstein’s
view and there is signiﬁcant overlap with the idea of “hidden variables”; note, though,
that, despite its status as a so-called hidden variable theory, the pilot-wave theory is
“ψ-ontic” rather than “ψ-epistemic” since it claims that a complete physical state
description includes ψ.) See Ref. [30] for a somewhat-dated but excellent review, and
Ref. [31] for the more recent and highly thought-provoking paper that stimulated an
important subsequent proof, in Ref. [32], that the ψ-epistemic viewpoint is actually
in conﬂict with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics so that, if those
statistical predictions are right, the quantum state ψ must be (in a certain sense) part
of the ontology of any viable theory. This so-called PBR theorem (the initials of its
authors) has generated signiﬁcant further debate and elaboration.
Topics that were raised in the present book, but in a relatively simpliﬁed or super-
ﬁcial way, are also good ones for further independent reading and research. One
important example here is the “no hidden variables” theorems mentioned in Chap.3.
Crucial references here include Bell’s classic paper [33] and Mermin’s review article
[34]. References [35, 36] are also of interest.
Another example is the concept of “decoherence” which, despite only being men-
tioned explicitly in Chap.10, plays a crucial role in all of the quantum theories we’ve
explored. Indeed, there are many physicists who believe that decoherence alone (i.e.,
withouttheneedtobringinhiddenvariables,spontaneouscollapses,ormany-worlds)
already solves the measurement problem. The recent article [37] and book [38] by

308
Afterword
Max Schlosshauer would be good entry-points into the vast literature on this sub-
ject. (Continued study of the important background concept of “density matrices”,
in standard quantum mechanics texts, would also be helpful.) Ref. [39] is also of
interest.
Finally, there is a near-inﬁnite list of topics, not really touched on in this book
but related to the foundations of quantum mechanics, on which there has been some
interesting recent development. One important example is the concept of “weak
measurement”, which was initiated by the 1988 paper of Aharanov, Albert, and
Vaidman with the intriguing title “How the result of a measurement of a component
of the spin of a spin-1/2 particle can turn out to be 100”. [40] See References [41],
(especially) [42, 43] to follow a particularly interesting thread that relates closely
to the pilot-wave theory. Reference [44] is another example (of many that could be
mentioned) of an interesting application of the idea of “weak measurement”.
Another even-more sprawling area with connections to the material we’ve covered
is the ﬁeld of “quantum information”, which includes such concepts as “quantum
cryptography” and “quantum computing”. The textbook by Nielsen and Chuang is
an excellent place to start learning about this broad and highly-active area. [45]
