translations into the forward light cone, which is invariant under the group of orthochronous

sion of causality [39,40]

Rigged Hilbert Spaces and Dirac’s Bra-Ket Formalism
The rigged Hilbert space (RHS) is a triplet of linear topological spaces
 ⊂H ⊂×,
(1)
which is obtained from a linear space with scalar product  by completing it with
respect to three topologies. A topology τ speciﬁes the deﬁnition of convergence,
and when a space is completed with respect to a topology τ, the τ-limit elements of
Cauchy sequences are adjoined to the space. For example, in (1) the space H is an
abstract Hilbert space, i.e. it is the completion of  with respect to the topology τH
given by the norm ||φ|| = √(φ, φ). The space  is the completion with respect to a
stronger topology τ and the space × is the space of continuous functionals on .

The linear space with scalar product  is the space that most physics texts and
papers call “the Hilbert space”. The space × is the space one needs in order to
give a mathematical meaning to the formalism that Dirac introduced in the ﬁrst edi-
tion (1930) of his book [1], and which he simpliﬁed in the third edition (1947) [2]
 Dirac notation. The space H is the space that von Neumann introduced in his
Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics in 1932 [3], where he remarked
that Dirac’s formalism [1] is “scarcely surpassed in brevity and elegance” but “in
no way satisﬁes the requirements of rigor.” An example of a Hilbert space, also
called a realization of the abstract Hilbert space, is the space of Lebesgue square
integrable functions L2. Unfortunately, in this space one cannot deﬁne the scalar
product of functions with the commonly used Riemann integrals; instead one must
use Lebesgue integrals to obtain the complete Hilbert space L2 (and not just a real-
ization of the linear space ).
Von Neumann’s Hilbert space provides a mathematically rigorous formulation
of quantum mechanics, but it has some physically unintuitive features. For instance,
a state is represented not by a single wave function, but by a class of Lebesgue
square integrable functions that differ from each other on a set of measure zero,
which could even be the set of rational numbers. In contrast, physicists measure
probability distributions at only a ﬁnite number of points and then interpolate the
data with smooth functions. This practice suggests that states are better represented
by functions φ(E) that have the following properties: they are continuous, inﬁnitely
differentiable, and they and their derivatives decrease for E →∞faster than any
inverse power of E. These properties deﬁne the Schwartz function space.
The standard example, used in quantum mechanics [4–6], group representa-
tions [7–11] and axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory [12], is the following RHS (1):
the space  is realized by the space of Schwartz functions on the positive real line
S(R+). The space H is realized by Lebesgue square-integrable functions L2(R+)
and the space × is realized by the space of tempered distributions S×(R+), which
includes generalized functions like the Dirac delta deﬁned below.
In quantum mechanical applications of RHSs, the space  is identiﬁed as the
space of physical states, i.e. those states that can be prepared and measured by ex-
periments. The  observables that act as linear operators on the physical states
should be represented by continuous linear operators in  and the set of these ob-
servables are represented by an algebra of  operators. That means observables can
be multiplied and added without worrying about domain questions since they are all
deﬁned everywhere in . This feature is of enormous importance for practical cal-
culations, but cannot be implemented in the Hilbert space even for the basic algebra
of observables generated by position Q, momentum P, and energy H operators that
fulﬁll the Heisenberg commutation relations
(QP −PQ) = [Q, P] = iℏ
(2a)
and
H = P 2
2m + V (Q).
(2b)

662
Rigged Hilbert Spaces and Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory
Within the Dirac formalism it is tacitly assumed that observables can be added
and multiplied. This means that the space  must be constructed such that the
observables form an algebra of linear operators deﬁned on the linear space of
states .
(3)
Observables are measured by numerical values; therefore the operators that rep-
resent them should have eigenvalues and eigenvectors. One can prove, however,
that for certain operators, such as P and Q in (2a), there are no eigenvectors in the
Hilbert space. Nonetheless, Dirac postulated that the observables (like P, Q, and H
in(2a), but also more generally) have a complete set of eigenvectors, the Dirac kets.
These kets were postulated to have the following two properties:
(i) On them, the observables have a set of eigenvalues that are discrete, continuous,
or a combination of continuous and discrete:
H|E⟩= E|E⟩, with 0 ⩽E < ∞and/or E ∈{E1, E2, ..., En, ...}
(4a)
P|p⟩= p|p⟩, with −∞< p < ∞
(4b)
Q|x⟩= x|x⟩, with −∞< x < ∞.
(4c)
This means the kets are labeled by the eigenvalues such as x, p, and E.
(ii) These vectors provide a basis system and every vector ψ ∈ can be uniquely
represented by a linear combination of these basis vectors.
As an example of the second point, consider the case that H has only a discrete
set of eigenvectors |En⟩. Then every ψ is expanded as
|ψ⟩=

n
|En⟩cn =

n
|En⟩⟨En|ψ⟩,
(5a)
where the coordinates or components cn = ⟨En|ψ⟩are complex numbers. The ba-
sis vectors |En⟩are orthonormal (orthogonal and normalized) if H is self-adjoint
(H = H †), i.e.
(|Ei⟩, |Ej⟩) = ⟨Ei|Ej⟩= δij =
* 1 i = j
0 i ̸= j .
(5b)
The norm of every state vector ψ is ﬁnite and is calculated as
(ψ, ψ) =

n
⟨ψ|En⟩⟨En|ψ⟩=

n
|⟨En|ψ⟩|2 =

n
|cn|2 < ∞.
(5c)
This holds, for instance, if H in (2b) has the particular form of a quantum oscillator
with mass m and spring constant k:
H = P 2
2m + 1
2kQ2
(6)

with En = ℏω(n + 1/2) (n = 0, 1, . . .) and where ω = √k/m. The equations (5)
are the inﬁnite dimensional generalizations of the basis vector expansion of a three
dimensional vector x = 3
i=1 eixi.
In general one cannot ﬁnd for every self-adjoint operator such as H or P a com-
plete set of eigenvectors such that (5) holds. However, in the RHS (1) realized by
the Schwartz space
S(R) ⊂L2(R) ⊂S×(R),
(7)
for every vector ψ ∈ and every self-adjoint operator, the continuous analogues of
(5a) hold:
|ψ⟩=


n|En⟩cn +
 ∞

dE |E⟩ψ(E)
.
(8c)
The kets |x⟩, |p⟩, and |E⟩exist as generalized eigenvectors of the operators Q,
P, and H (or any other self-adjoint operator representing an observable). They are
elements of × and the eigenvalue equations (4) are deﬁned to mean
⟨ψ|H ×|E⟩≡⟨Hψ|E⟩= E⟨ψ|E⟩for all ψ ∈,
(9)
and similarly for |p⟩, |x⟩, etc. The coordinates or wave functions ⟨E|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|E⟩∗
are elements of the Schwartz space S(R), not of L2(R), and the generalized basis
vector expansions (8) do not hold for every ψ ∈H but only for every ψ ∈. The
operator H ×, called the conjugate operator of H, is deﬁned generally for all linear
continuous operators A on φ by
⟨Aψ|F⟩= ⟨ψ|A×|F⟩
(10)
for all ψ ∈ and all F ∈×. Since the space  is constructed such that the
physical observables are represented by continuous operators on the space , the
conjugate A× is a continuous operator in ×. The conjugate A× is an extension
of the Hilbert space adjoint A†: A† ⊂A×. The observables form an algebra of
operators in  as well as in ×. In contrast, in the Hilbert space H, one cannot have
a continuous algebra of observables even for the canonical commutation relations
(2a). For an example of how to construct the Schwartz space for the operator algebra
of (2a) and (6) see [13], Sect. 1.
The continuous analogue of (5c) is now
(ψ, ψ) =
 
dE dE′⟨ψ|E⟩(|E⟩, |E′⟩)⟨E′|ψ⟩,
(11)

664
Rigged Hilbert Spaces and Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory
but for this to make sense one needs the continuous analogue (|E⟩, |E′⟩) of the
Kronecker delta δnm of (5b). This is obtained if one takes the generalized scalar
product (|E′⟩, ψ) (precisely, the functional ⟨E′| at any element ψ ∈):
⟨E′|ψ⟩=
 ∞
0
dE ⟨E′|E⟩⟨E|ψ⟩.
(12)
By treating the new symbol ⟨E′|E⟩introduced in (12) as though it were a scalar
product like (5b) but extended to continuous values, the object ⟨E′|E⟩has the prop-
erty that it maps the function ψ(E) ∈S(R+) by integration over the positive real
axis to its speciﬁc value ψ(E′) at a particular energy E′. A mathematical object
with such a property did not exist in the mathematics of the 1920s and 1930s, but
only achieved rigorous deﬁnition when Schwartz created the theory of distributions
or generalized functions 20 years later [14]. Dirac’s formalism was unhindered by
all these mathematical complications. He postulated the properties (4) and (8), and
since (5b) held for the discrete case, he introduced the Dirac delta “function”
⟨E′|E⟩= δ(E −E′)
(13)
and stipulated that it fulﬁll (12). It is not truly a function, but it is a distribution and
an element of S×(R+).
The requirements expressed in (3), (12), and (13) form the basis of Dirac’s for-
malism for quantum mechanics. Inspired by this, ﬁrst Schwartz created the theory
of distributions [14]. Then, extending this work, the Gel’fand school [15, 16] in-
troduced into mathematics the RHS for the spectral analysis of  self-adjoint and
unitary operators. Their nuclear spectral theorem is the mathematical version of
Dirac’s continuous basis vector expansion (8). The RHS is the mathematical struc-
ture in which various assumption of Dirac’s formalism, e.g. (2a), (4), (8c), (12), and
(13), can be realized [4–11].
Thus, the Dirac formalism has been given a mathematical meaning by the
Schwartz-RHS. The RHS’s of quantum physical systems are constructed such that
the fundamental observables, like momentum, energy, and position (and many more,
such as angular momentum and intrinsic observables like charges and isospin usu-
ally connected with groups of transformations of space time and of charge spaces)
are represented by an algebra of continuous operators. Then one chooses a complete
commuting system of observables. For the oscillator this is just one operator, for ex-
ample H, P or Q, and the Dirac basis vector expansion for the operator is like (5a),
(8a), or (8b) for the oscillator. For other quantum systems, for example a particle
in a spherically symmetric potential of the three dimensional space, the complete
system of commuting observables consists of three operators, either the momentum
operators P1, P2, and P3 or the Hamiltonian H and angular momentum operators
J2 and J3, and possibly some other set of observables that measure, for example,
the internal properties and whose eigenvalues are collectively labeled as η. Then the
Dirac basis vector expansion (nuclear spectral theorem) is

Hardy Space Triplets for Resonance Scattering and Decay
The Schwartz-RHS gives a mathematical justiﬁcation for the Dirac formalism. It
deﬁnes the Dirac kets, justiﬁes the algebraic manipulation of the observables, and
proves the continuous basis vector expansion (8). However, it does not provide a
mathematical theory of scattering, resonances, and decaying states, and neither does
the Hilbert space formulation. The description of resonances and decay phenomena
in standard quantum mechanics is provided by the Weisskopf–Wigner approxima-
tions [17, 18] and it is well-known to experts that “there does not exist...a rigorous
theory to which these various methods can be considered and approximation” [19].
This is connected with the Stone–von Neumann theorem [20, 21] which states that
the solutions of the  Schr¨odinger equation in H are given by the time-symmetric
unitary group U†(t) = exp(−iHt) (or by the unitary group U(t) = exp(iHt)) for
all times −∞< t < ∞. In the RHS formulation using the Schwartz space, the
space  (and not H) is the set of physical states. That means one has to solve the
Schr¨odinger equation
idφ(t)
dt
= Hφ(t)
(15)
under the boundary condition that φ ∈. Note that  and H have different deﬁ-
nitions of convergence, therefore the limits involved in taking the derivative of φ in
the space  is different from taking the limit in H. The τH-limit is deﬁned by one
norm, whereas the τ-limit is stronger and given by countably inﬁnite number of
norms. Thus the solutions of (15) in  do not have to be the same as the solutions
in H [22], but for the Schwartz-RHS, the solutions to (15) also have the group time
evolution property:
φ(t) = e−iHtφ, for all −∞< t < ∞and for all φ ∈.
(16)
Therefore, the Hilbert space axiom of standard (von Neumann) quantum theory,
set of physical states = {φ} = H = Hilbert space,
(17)
as well as the Schwartz space axiom of the mathematical theory for the Dirac for-
malism,
set of physical states = {φ} =  = abstract Schwartz space,
(18)

lead to the same reversible time evolution. The time evolution of the prepared states
fulﬁlls (16) and there will exist a state φ(t) for every t > 0 and also for every t < 0.
The physical quantities measured in experiments with quantum systems are the
Born probabilities. For instance, the probability to measure an observable & =
|ψ⟩⟨ψ| in the state φ is given by the Born probability |⟨ψ|φ(t)⟩|2, and according
to (16), this is predicted for every time −∞< t < ∞. However, this contradicts
causality; a quantum mechanical state must be prepared ﬁrst at some time t0 before
the observable can be measured in this state at times t > t0. That means Born proba-
bilities |⟨ψ|φ(t)⟩|2 can be measured only for t > t0. Consequentially, the evolution
(16) makes physical sense only for t ⩾t0. In other words, instead of the unitary
group solution, one should ﬁnd solutions that obey semigroup evolution
φ(t) = e−iH(t−t0)φ, for only t > t0.
(19)
Such solutions do not exist in the Schwartz space  or in the Hilbert space H.
The time t0 before which “the state is deﬁned completely by the preparation”
has already been mentioned by Feynman [23]. Gell-Mann and Hartle [24] applied
this idea to the probabilities of histories for the expanding universe considered as a
closed quantum system. They did not derive (19); they restricted the time evolution
in (16) to t > t0 (where t0 is the time of the big bang) by ﬁat, violating the Hilbert
space and Schwartz space axioms (17) and (18). Other examples of systems with a
physically well-deﬁned t0 are quasi-stable particles produced by the strong interac-
tions that decay on a much slower time scale via the weak interaction [25]. That the
decay of excited atoms and of elementary particles is a time asymmetric (sometimes
also called irreversible) process has also been remarked in textbooks [26–28].
In the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics [3], one cannot distin-
guish between vectors φ describing states and vectors ψ describing observables like
& = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| (or more general observables like A = 
n an|ψn⟩⟨ψn|). One assumes
that
set of states = {φ} = H = set of observable vectors = {ψ}
(20)
and the time evolution for both is given by a unitary group for all times t. In the Dirac
formalism based on (18), one also identiﬁes the set of state vectors and observables
vectors:
{φ} =  = {ψ}
(21)
and one has a single basis vector expansion such as (14) (or (8)) and one space
of continuous antilinear functionals (kets) |E⟩= |E, j, j3, η⟩∈×. In contrast,
two sets of basis vectors are used in the heuristic conventional treatment of scatter-
ing theory. These are the plane wave in-states |E+⟩and out-“states” |E−⟩that are
solutions of the Lippmann–Schwinger (LS) equation and are given by
|E±⟩= |E ± iϵ⟩= |E⟩+
1
E −H ± iϵ V |E⟩,
(22)
where ϵ →+0, (H −V )|E⟩= E|E⟩, and V represents the scattering poten-
tial [29–31]. The ± iϵ in the LS equation (22) implies that the energy wave functions
(ψ−(E))∗= ⟨−E|ψ−⟩∗= ⟨ψ−|E−⟩and φ+(E) = ⟨+E|φ+⟩are the boundary

values of analytic functions in the lower complex energy semi-plane (for complex
energy z = (E + iϵ)∗= E −iϵ, immediately below the real axis on the second
sheet of the S-matrix). In analogy to the Dirac expansion (8c), the |E±⟩are taken as
basis systems for the Dirac basis vector expansions

(23b)
The ± iϵ in the phenomenological LS equation (22) suggests that the energy wave
functions ⟨−E|ψ−⟩are Schwartz functions that can be analytically continued into
the upper half complex energy plane (second sheet of the S-matrix) and the ⟨+E|φ+⟩
are Schwartz functions analytic in the lower complex plane. Since the sets of vec-
tors {φ+} and {ψ−} are deﬁned by the sets of wave functions {⟨+E|φ+⟩} and
{⟨−E|ψ−⟩}, it suggests that there are two RHS’s involved. One RHS
{φ+} = −⊂H ⊂×
−
(24a)
is used for the set of state vectors {φ+} (in-states), which are deﬁned by the prepa-
ration apparatus, such as an accelerator. Another RHS
{ψ−} = + ⊂H ⊂×
+
(24b)
is used for the set of observable vectors {ψ−} (out-states, or better, out-observables),
which are deﬁned by the registration apparatus, such as a detector. The vectors φ+
and ψ−are very similar to the in- and out-states in the S-matrix element of tradi-
tional scattering theory [32–34]:
⟨−ψ|φ+⟩= (ψ−, φ+) = (ψout, Sφin) = (ψout, φout).
(25)
To specify the properties of the wave functions ⟨−E|ψ−⟩and ⟨+E|φ+⟩and
therewith the spaces + and −of vectors ψ−and φ+, one checks under which
mathematical conditions on the spaces {⟨−E|ψ−⟩} and {⟨+E|φ+⟩} one can derive
reasonable physical consequences from the hypothesis (24). A reasonable physical
consequence would be a uniﬁcation of resonance scattering and decay phenomena.
One starts with the deﬁnition of a resonance by the S-matrix pole at the complex
energy zR = ER −i/2. From the pole, one seeks the requirements that will allow
the derivation of two important signatures of time asymmetry: the Breit–Wigner
amplitude for resonance scattering

and the exponentially decaying Gamow vector φG for the unstable states. The
Gamow vector must be a ket φG = |(ER−i/2)−⟩= |(ER−i/2), j, j3, η−⟩∈×
+
(it is not in H, where exponentially decaying states are precluded [35]) with the
eigenvalue property
⟨Hψ−|(ER −i/2)−⟩≡⟨ψ−|H ×|(ER −i/2)−⟩=(ER −i/2)⟨ψ−|(ER −i/2)−⟩
(26b)
for all ψ−∈+. Here H × is the unique extension of H † = H to the space ×
+.
Further, φG must have the exponential semigroup evolution
⟨e−iHtψ−|(ER −i/2)−⟩≡⟨ψ−|e−iH ×t|(ER −i/2)−⟩
= eiERte−t/2⟨ψ−|(ER −i/2)−⟩
(26c)
for all ψ−∈+ but only for t ⩾0 since the decaying state must ﬁrst be prepared
at a time t = t0 = 0 before it can decay.
The results (26a)–(26c) can be obtained if one assumes that in addition to being
Schwartz functions, the energy wave functions can be analytically continued into
either the upper- or lower-half complex energy plane (second sheet) [36]. Precisely,
the analytically continued wave functions ψ−(z) = ⟨−z|ψ−⟩and φ+(z) = ⟨+z|φ+⟩
are smooth Hardy functions 1 on the complex semiplanes C+ and C−, respectively:
φ+(E) = ⟨+E|φ+⟩∈(H2
−∩S)|R+
(27a)
ψ−(E) = ⟨−E|ψ−⟩∈(H2
+ ∩S)|R+.
(27b)
The mismatch in signs between the wave function and the smooth Hardy spaces is
for historical reasons: the ‘±’ of the wave functions is the convention in scattering
theory and has an independent origin from the ‘±’ of the Hardy space analyticity
requirements.
1 A precise deﬁnition of the smooth Hardy space is that a function ψ−(E) is in H2
+ ∩S if and
only if: (i) ψ−(E) belongs to the Schwartz space S, (ii) ψ−(E) admits analytic continuation,
ψ−(z) = ψ−(E + iy), to the upper half plane (y > 0), and (iii) For any straight line in the upper
half plane parallel to the real line, there exists a positive number K > 0 such that for all positive
y > 0 the integral

 ∞
−∞|ψ−(E + iy)|2 dx < K is uniformly bounded by K, which means that the
bound is valid for a particular K and any y > 0. This integral is the usual Riemann integral and
the constant K depends on the speciﬁc function ψ−(E). The deﬁnition for H2
−∩S is identical,
just replacing the upper half plane by the lower half plane. Since any function in H2
± ∩S is an
analytic continuation of a function on the real line, it is automatically determined by its values
on any interval in the real line and viceversa. In particular, any function in H2
± ∩S is totally
determined by its values on the positive half line and conversely. The spaces H2
± ∩S|R+ are the
spaces of functions in H2
±∩S, restricted to the positive semiaxis, i.e., in the functions in H2
±∩S|R+,
we have ignored their values on the negative part of the real line. This shows a one to one onto
correspondence between the spaces H2
± ∩S and H2
± ∩S|R+.

and show that these Hardy function spaces are locally convex nuclear spaces [37].
Therefore, the Dirac basis vector expansions (23) are fulﬁlled as the nuclear
spectral theorem for the Hardy space triplets (24). The time asymmetry (19) is
the mathematical consequence of the Paley–Wiener theorem [38] in the same
way the unitary group evolution is the consequence of the Stone–von Neumann
theorem [20,21].
Therewith (27) is an axiom for the mathematical theory of quantum physics that
distinguishes mathematically between prepared (in-)states described by the RHS
(24a) and registered observables described by the RHS (24b) in the same way as
the experimentalists distinguish between the preparation apparatus of a state and
the detector of an observable. It provides a uniﬁed description of resonance and
decay phenomena and it leads to asymmetric, semigroup time evolution. Without
the mathematical notion of the RHS this time asymmetric quantum theory could not
have been conceived. See also  Time in quantum mechanics.
