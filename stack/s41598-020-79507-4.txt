p‑adic numbers encode complex 
networks
Hao Hua1,2* & Ludger Hovestadt3
The Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graph G(n, p) analytically characterizes the behaviors in complex 
networks. However, attempts to fit real-world observations need more sophisticated structures 
(e.g., multilayer networks), rules (e.g., Achlioptas processes), and projections onto geometric, social, 
or geographic spaces. The p-adic number system offers a natural representation of hierarchical 
organization of complex networks. The p-adic random graph interprets n as the cardinality of a set 
of p-adic numbers. Constructing a vast space of hierarchical structures is equivalent for combining 
number sequences. Although the giant component is vital in dynamic evolution of networks, the 
structure of multiple big components is also essential. Fitting the sizes of the few largest components 
to empirical data was rarely demonstrated. The p-adic ultrametric enables the ER model to simulate 
multiple big components from the observations of genetic interaction networks, social networks, 
and epidemics. Community structures lead to multimodal distributions of the big component sizes in 
networks, which have important implications in intervention of spreading processes.
Number theory has a reputation of “unreasonable effectiveness.” Perhaps the most famous example is the Fibo-
nacci numbers, which are closely related to golden ratio, plant growth (Phyllotaxis), and DNA patterns. Over the 
past years, a few developments have begun to unfold the potentials of number theory in understanding complex 
­networks1,2. This work employs the p-adic numbers for modeling complex networks based on the Erdős-Rényi 
(ER) random graph. The p-adic number system gives an extension of the ordinary arithmetic of rational num-
bers ( Q ) in a way distinct from the common extension of Q to real numbers ( R ) and complex numbers ( C ). The 
p-adic number system can be applied in various scientific fields. One groundbreaking application in physics is 
the p-adic AdS/CFT3. Khrennikov et al.4 developed p-adic wavelet for modeling reaction-diffusion dynamics. 
Applications in biology include the models for hierarchical structures of ­protein5 and genetic ­code6.
Networks, behaviors, and health. 
There is growing interest on a unified theory of complex networks 
from various ­fields7–9. The formalism commenced with graph theory in mathematics. The emergence of giant 
component is essential for the evaluation of random ­graphs10–12. Network analysis revealed hidden structures in 
social and economic ­systems13,14. Exponential random ­graph15 and stochastic ­blockmodels16,17 were developed. 
Many statistical mechanics in physics, e.g., ­percolation18 and time ­series19, are modeled with complex networks. 
Network models are closely associated with ­epidemiology20,21 and public ­health22. Chains of ­affection23 is a clas-
sical work revealing the network structure as a critical factor in public health. The spatiotemporal ­dynamics20 is 
essential for understanding the epidemic processes.
The complex networks also play an essential role in the microscopic scale. Numerous researches in biology 
rely on the curation and archival storage of protein, genetic, and chemical interactions for all major model 
organism species and humans (e.g. BioGRID and STRING database). The disease ­network24,25, protein-protein 
interaction network, and gene ­network26 contributed to the network approaches to life ­science27. In the near 
future, the network advances in biology, such as drug ­targeting28,29 and network ­medicine30, might be critical 
for improving our health.
Erdős–Rényi model and extensions. 
The classical ER model has inspired the continuous development 
of a rich spectrum of sophisticated models. There are three major approaches:
•	 Creating more complex structures such as multilayer ­networks31,32 and multiplex ­networks33,34. Complex 
networks often exhibit community or module ­structures7.

•	 Manipulating the rules for constructing edges. The Achlioptas process picks two candidate edges each ­time18 
for competitive graph-evolution. ER process, Bohman and Frieze process, and product rule process were 
compared with one another for analyzing explosive ­percolation35.
•	 Projecting graphs onto social, geometric, or geographic structures. Major developments in that aspect include 
the hyperbolic ­networks36, spatial preferential ­attachment37, inhomogeneous random ­graph38,39, and spatial 
­networks30.
Findings. 
Common attempts to modeling the hierarchical ­structures7 are reflected by various notions includ-
ing subpopulation, subgraph, mixing pattern, community, and module. We postulate that hierarchical struc-
tures are naturally encrypted in a standard graph. Consequently, imposing additional structures onto a graph 
to enrich its behavior is not always necessary. The key is the p-adic absolute ­value40. According to Ostrowski’s 
theorem, every non-trivial absolute value on Q is either the usual real absolute value or the p-adic absolute value. 
Various hierarchical structures can be represented by p-adic integers as nodal indices. The network topology and 
relative strengths between connections are unified as p-adic distances between numbers.
The p-adic random graph (PARG), probably the simplest model of inhomogeneous networks, offers a flex-
ible method to simulate various observations in complex networks, especially the phenomenon of multiple 
big components. Degree distribution is a key property for distinguishing random, free-scale, and small world 
networks. However, PARG indicates that two random graphs with identical degree distribution may produce 
significantly different component sizes.
We fit PARG to the component size distribution of the genetic interaction networks, and also to the joint 
distributions of big components in COVID-19 outbreaks. The experiments imply that the community structures 
are responsible for the multimodal distributions of the sizes of big components. The largest or the second largest 
component could be more stable at (multiple) specific sizes. Therefore, maintaining a local peak could be valuable 
for intervening the spreading processes.
p‑adic random graph
In contrast to the celebrated ER network, another early prototype of random graph, the Rado graph, has been 
rarely revisited. The Rado graph employs the binary number system to encode the graph edges, using Ackermann 
coding of hereditarily finite sets. PARG explores the fundamental nature of integers to encode the probability of 
connecting a pair of nodes. The p-adic number system extends the ordinary arithmetic of rational ­numbers3,40. 
Our PARG model will focus on the p-adic metric on nonnegative integers. An integer’s r-adic (picking a prime 
number r) absolute value is the reciprocal of the largest power of r that divides it. For example, |40|2 = 1/8 (let 
r=2, then the 2-adic absolute value of 40 equals 1/8), |40|3 = 1 , |40|5 = 1/5 . Such absolute value is the most sig-
nificant example of ­ultrametrics40. Each node is naturally associated with an integer, i.e., its index in the ordered 
set of nodes, or an arbitrary (unique) integer can be assigned to each node. The probability of connecting any 
pair of nodes i, j is proportional to the p-adic closeness between the two nodal indices vi, vj :
for i, j ∈[1, n], i < j (assuming i < j ⇔vi < vj ). p∗ is a constant as the probability in the ER sense. When 
comparing ER and PARG, we normalize the PARG probability so that 
ij pij = n(n −1)p∗/2 . As a result, the 
number of edges in ER equals that in PARG. The p-adic distances encode a hierarchical structure, as shown in 
the circular tree-map in Fig. 1a. The distances between any pair of numbers from the same small circle and the 
same big circle are 1/9 and 1/3, respectively. If the two numbers are from different big circles, their distance is 1.
The digit format of a p-adic number is intuitive, for example, 2013 = 2 · 30 + 0 · 31 + 1 · 32 = 11 . One can 
construct a set of integers (as the nodal indices) in their digit formats by
where r is the chosen prime number. We call the model a full PARG if u0 = u1 = · · · = um = r (i.e., n = rm+1 ), 
otherwise, we call it a regular PARG (i.e., n = 
i ui ). The nodal indices can also be arbitrary digits under a given 
prime r, which leads to a general PARG. The expression (2) facilities the enumeration of hierarchical structures. 
For example, 3.2.33 fully describes a hierarchical structure as shown in Fig. 1c. More examples are in illustrated 
in Fig. 1. A notation such as G(3.2.33, p∗) fully specifies a PARG.
PARG implements a Bernoulli process on all pairs from a set of p-adic numbers. Let pk represent the prob-
ability of a randomly chosen node with degree k. In the ER model, pk follows a Binomial distribution. It becomes 
a Poisson distribution in the limit of large n. By contrast, n in PARG equals the number of individuals in observa-
tions. Because of the symmetric connectivity in regular PARG, pk can be obtained from the degree distribution 
of one node:
where m
i=0 di = n −1 holds. di denotes the number of links (from the chosen node) with probability rip∗ 
according to (1-2). The numbers α0, α1, · · · , αm denote all combinations satisfying k = m
i=0 αi . Numeric com-
puting of (3) indicates that pk in PARG and that in ER are almost identical. The two models can have the same 
degree distribution and the same number of edges. However, there could be significant differences in the size 
distributions of big components in PARG and ER (Fig. 2, Supplementary Note 1, Table S1 and S2). The largest

components in PARG may exhibit multimodal distribution due to the hierarchical structure. This implies that 
certain sizes of (multiple) big components are more statistically stable than other sizes.
Sizes of big components
The relative sizes of multiple big components in complex networks were much less studied compared to the 
studies carried out on the giant ­component12,41. Analytical ­methods11,42 and generating ­functions10 have been 
widely employed for analyzing the component sizes. Rather than let n →∞ , n in PARG is equal to the number 
of relevant individuals in observations. As a result, the sizes of simulated components are similar to that in 
ground truth. When n is finite, numeric random realizations are suited to evaluate the various probabilities about 
component sizes (see “Methods” section).
When n is fixed, fitting ER model to empirical data only involves the single parameter p, while PARGs involve 
two kinds of parameters: the probability p and the hierarchical structures represented by (2). The configura-
tion space of (2) is very vast, even when n < 1000 , so we opted for ad hoc heuristics to choose the hierarchical 
structures that fit relatively well to observations. The heuristics includes: (1) scaling the distances. For example, 
7.5.6r with r = 7, 11, 13, · · · represent the same hierarchical structure, though the distances between the levels are 
scaled. (2) Flat vs. deep hierarchy. For instance, both 16.1617 and 2.2.2.2.2.2.2.22 refer to 256 nodes. The former 
is made of 16 groups (each contains 16 nodes), while the latter’s structure looks like a high tree.
Based on the hierarchical structures in PARG, the following experiments analyze multiple big components, 
especially 5|C2| > |C1| , as static structures observed in networks. The topics range from microscopic networks, 
such as biological ­networks26,28, to macroscopic networks, such as ­epidemics21,43.
Genetic interaction networks. 
The essential role of genetic interaction networks plays in biology has 
been lately ­revealed25. The essential genetic interaction network of yeast genes (theCellmap.org) contains 1,261 
mutant strains. Their interactions have been characterized by Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Genes 
with highly correlated genetic interaction profiles (PCC>0.4) form clusters of specific pathways or protein 
­complexes26. We set three PCC thresholds above 0.4 to obtain three graphs with distinct big components, as 
shown in Fig. 3g–i. We count the components sizes falling into the predefined intervals of Fibonacci numbers 
( bi+1 = bi + bi−1, b0 = 3 ). Let θi be the number of simulated components whose sizes fall between bi and bi+1 , 
and θ∗
i  be that in ground truth. The error of a random realization is given by
The averaged error from many random realizations yields a relatively accurate evaluation. ER and PARG with 
distinct values of np lead to different errors (Fig. 3a–c). Equipped with (configurable) hierarchical structures, 
PARGs fit better to observations than ER. The component size distributions of the best fits are shown in Fig. 3d−f.
Protein‑protein interaction. 
Exploring the protein interaction networks of proteins poses a major chal-
lenge in biomedicine. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is crucial to understanding cellular pathways and human 
­diseases44. The following experiment creates a graph from a set of 408 S. cerevisiae protein complexes ­as45. The 
graph nodes represent individual proteins from these complexes. An edge is constructed between two nodes 
(proteins) if they belong to the same complex. The graph includes 1,628 nodes and 11,249 edges.
We define the similar metric Sduo and Stri (see “Methods” section) to compare the simulated component sizes 
with the ground truth. PARG fits better ( Stri=0.307) than the ER model ( Stri=0.112) to the PPI network, as shown 
in Fig. 4. The simulation data can be found in supplementary Table S3 and S4. It means that the chosen PARG 
has a higher probability that the sizes of its big components resemble those in the PPI network.
Instrumental resource street network. 
There has been growing attention to the impact of social net-
works on ­health46. For example, homeless youth is an active research field, including analysis and interventions. 
Social networks of homeless ­youth47,48 are vital for understanding and intervening the observed phenomena.
This experiment involves a social network about employment services utilization among homeless youth. The 
original ­research49 queried 136 homeless youth in Los Angeles in 2008. Four distinct networks were constructed 
from the same population, according to instrumental, emotional, employment services use, and sociometric 
relationship respectively. Only the instrumental network ( |C∗
1|=30, |C∗
2|=13) satisfies 5|C∗
2| > |C∗
1| , i.e., the second 
largest component is large enough. Regarding the similarity metric Sduo , the ER model attains the maximum 
similarity ( Sduo=0.155) at p = 1.08/n ; while G(10.14353, 1.75/n) has a much higher similarity ( Sduo =0.316). The 
community structure in the PARG corresponds to the social or geographical networks of the homeless youth; 
although the map between the two is still elusive.
We also fit the hyperbolic ­networks36 and the Achlioptas ­process35 to the observed component sizes ( |C∗
1|=30, 
|C∗
2|=13). Details can be found in “Methods” section. The random hyperbolic ­graph50,51 reaches the maximum 
similarity ( Sduo=0.266) when C = −9.3 , α = 10 , D = 0.0684R . The Achlioptas process with product rule (PR) 
has the maximum similarity ( Sduo=0.221) when the number of edges is equal to 100. So PARG outperforms the 
other two models in this case.
Spreading of coronavirus. 
Coronavirus52 has spread among many Chinese cities since the end of January 
2020. The incubation ­period53 and possible mild ­symptoms54 made the prevention more complicated. Social 
networking sites (or local officials) reported traces of infected people. Relationships between the infected (and 
those who had close contacts with them) were also investigated. From a point of view of networks, the cities

exhibited three distinct patterns: 1) No big components. Shenzen reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 
2020. The largest cluster has only 9 people. 2) A giant component. Xinyu reported 110 confirmed cases by Febru-
ary 10, 2020. The giant component consists of 52 cases, nearly half of the infected population. The second largest 
component has only six cases. 3) Multiple big components. Tianjin reported 136 confirmed cases by February 3, 
2020. The first, second, and third largest clusters contain 44, 17 and 11 cases, respectively, which are related to a 
huge department store, the railway, and a residential area, respectively.
We focus on Tianjin’s infection network (Supplementary Note 1, Table 5), which consists of multiple big 
components. A graph is created to visualize the relationship between the infected when the outbreak was around 
its peak, as shown in Fig. 5. The simulation data can be found in Supplementary Table S6 and S7. The similarity 
metric Stri could be biased when |C∗
3| is quite smaller than |C∗
1| , so the similarity metric Ttri (see “Methods” section) 
is employed in this case to fit the models to the observed clusters, as shown in Fig. 6. The PARG G(8.1759, 1.49/n) 
has the highest similarity Ttri=0.00916.
We also compared the results of the random hyperbolic graph and the Achlioptas process with that of 
PARG. The random hyperbolic graph reaches the maximum similarity ( Ttri=0.0150) when C = −9.65 , α = 1 , 
D = 0.04294R . The Achlioptas process with Bohman Frieze (BF) rule has the maximum similarity ( Ttri=0.00825) 
when the number of edges is equal to 93. So the random hyperbolic graph fits best to this case.

A later investigation indicates that the 11 cases (in yellow, Fig. 5) are probably related to the department 
store as well. In this new perspective, the two big clusters form the largest component of 55 nodes. We employ 
the metric Tduo to fit modes to this new observation ( |C∗
1|=55, |C∗
2|=17), as shown in Fig 7. The simulation data 
can be found in Supplementary Table S8 and S9. The great variety of hierarchical structures enable PARG to fit 
relatively well to observations from distinct perspectives.
Discussion
The size distributions of big components in complex networks are attributed to the structure of physical world; 
the behaviors of agents (nodes) and the information transmitting between them; and the observer (how to look 
at the events). The ER model offered prominent findings of component sizes in networks, however, it rarely fits 
the joint distribution P(|C1| ≈|C∗
1| , |C2| ≈|C∗
2| , · · · ) in real observations. A successful strategy is introducing 
inhomogeneous structures or selective rules (for constructing edges) to the random graph to increase its versa-
tility. PARG probably provides the simplest way to fully describe a hierarchical structure in an ER-like model.
PARG interprets the n in ER model as the cardinality of a set of natural numbers (nodal indices). Conse-
quently, the probability p can be weighted by distances between the nodal indices. In number theory (Ostrowski’s 
theorem), any non-trivial definition of absolute value on Q is either the conventional one or the p-adic absolute 
value. So, the p-adic ultrametric reveals the natural hierarchical structures hidden in any graph with indexed 
nodes. PARG blurs the boundaries between the topology approaches (e.g., multiplex networks) and the geometric 
approaches (e.g., hyperbolic networks).
In our PARG approach, n denotes the number of observed individuals, whereas in previous ER-like models 
n →∞ . The limit of n facilities analytical ­approaches10,11, while a relatively small finite n is convenient for 
numerical random realizations. Random graph theories such as explosive ­percolation35 and ­synchronization55, 
deeply revealed the dynamics of the emerged components. By contrast, this work explores the sizes of resultant 
(static) components from observations or simulations. The results imply that the proportions between the big 
component sizes are closely associated with the hierarchical structures of complex networks. This implication is 
in contrast to previous ­emphasis10,27,56 on degree distribution as the fingerprint of network structures.
We fit PARGs and other random graphs to observations from various types of networks. The PARG outper-
forms the ER model and the Achlioptas process. The random hyperbolic model fits better than PARG to certain 
cases but worse than PARG to other cases. The simulations of PARG show that the size of big components, e.g., 
P(|C1| = x) and P(|C2| = x) , can exhibit multimodal distribution (e.g., Figs. 2b and 7(b)) due to their modular 
structures. In the case of multimodal distribution, the first peak of P(|C2| = x) could be very close to the last 
peak of P(|C1| = x) . Thus, one may distinguish the major mode from the minor modes when investigating the 
giant component. One present challenge in network epidemic ­modeling57 is designing network-based interven-
tions. Current strategies include targeting high-degree nodes or central nodes. The multimodal distribution of

P(|Ci| = x) has implications in controlling the spreading processes in networks. Since P(|Ci| = x) has more than 
one local peak, it might be possible to predict and maintain the big components’ growth around a local peak.
Methods
Random graph implementation. 
All random graphs are created through random experiments imple-
mented in the Java programming language (Java 1.8 with Eclipse IDE). Given a connecting probability p (in the 
ER context), an edge is included in the graph if
where rand stands for a random number between 0 and 1, generated by the method nextDouble() from the java.

(LCG) with modulus 248.
A disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find algorithm) is employed to find all components in graph. N random 
realizations of ER or PARG yield an ensemble of binary numbers
for x = 1, 2, · · · , n . |Cj
i| denotes the size of the ith largest component in the jth realization. Then one can evaluate 
the size distribution of the big components by

Figure 5.   Network of infected cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin. A red outline indicates that the case was infected 
outside Tianjin; a black outline indicates that the case was infected inside Tianjin. An edge refers to the close 
contact between the two nodes (persons). An arrow indicates the infection process between the two nodes. 
The 44 nodes in orange represent the infected people who either worked or visited the department store. The 
17 blue nodes are related to the railway. The 11 yellow nodes represent the cases from a residential area. Later 
investigation indicates that the orange and yellow nodes are related, therefore they form a larger component of 
55 nodes.

We define the objective function
for a random graph to measure whether its first two/three largest component sizes are close to that in observation. 
When |C∗
2| or |C∗
3| is much smaller than |C∗
1| , the following metric would be more appropriate:
Genetic interaction network of yeast genes. 
The data of yeast genes is from https://thecellmap.org/ 
costanzo2016/. The networks in Fig. 3g–i are drawn from the data of the Essential × Essential network, which 
involves 1,261 mutant strains. So, each network in Fig. 3g–i consists of 1261 nodes. The PPC values between the 
mutant strains are obtained from the genetic interaction profile similarity matrices. An edge is included in the 
graph if the corresponding PPC value is above the predefined threshold. The graphs are projected onto squares 
using our Java program, as shown in Fig. 3g–i. In a dynamical process, the agents (nodes) push away from each 
other, while each edge drags the two end nodes into a fixed range. The color (hue) of edges indicates the size of 
the relevant component.
Protein network of yeast genes. 
The data of S. cerevisiae protein complexes is obtained from the addi-
tional File 1 ­of45. We programmed a Java application to read the table, construct the 1,628 nodes (proteins) and 
11,249 edges (a pair of nodes belong to a same complex), and find the components via Union-Find algorithm.
Random hyperbolic graph. 
Our implementation follows the formulation ­in50,51. R = 2 ln n + C denotes 
the radius of the disc. The probability density for the radial coordinate r of a point (r, φ) is given by
We use inverse transform sampling to generate the radii of the points, i.e., r = 1
aarcosh(1 + cosh(αR)x −x) where 
x ∈(0, 1) denotes a random number from the uniform distribution. Our experiments generate x by nextDouble() 
in Java. For each pair of nodes u, v, a link is added to the graph if d(u, v) < D where D ∈(0, R] is a constant and 
d(u, v) denotes the distance between the two points in the hyperbolic space.
Achlioptas process. 
At each time step of the Achlioptas ­process18,35, two edges e1 and e2 compete for addi-
tion. Suppose e1 involves two components of size |Ca|, |Cb| ; e2 involves two components of size |Cc|, |Cd| , we 
consider three types of competing rules:
•	 add e1 if |Ca| + |Cb| < |Cc| + |Cd| , add e2 otherwise.
•	 product rule (PR): add e1 if |Ca||Cb| < |Cc||Cd| , add e2 otherwise.
•	 Bohman Frieze (BF) rule: add e1 if |Ca| = |Cb| = 1 , add e2 otherwise.
Our experiment treats the number of edges (added to the graph) as the parameter.

Conclusions
A number theory approach to random graph is proposed. A set of n random numbers generates an n by n adja-
cency matrix whose binary elements follow the probability (1). Thus, a hierarchical structure is implemented 
through ­ultrametrics40,58. The simplicity of the digit form (2) for hierarchical structures of random graph facili-
tates the enumeration of different setting of clusters and hierarchies. In contrast to mapping complex structures 
or rules from real world to random graph, our PARG approach explores the complex structures in ­numbers2,59 
which might be rich enough for modeling complicated observations. An alternative point of view suggests that 
a plain graph can unfold a hidden hierarchical structure, based on an indispensable definition of absolute value.
The proposed PARG model is more abstract than multilayer networks, multiplex networks, and social-geo-
graphical models, but more concrete than ER-like models without community structures. Therefore, a future 
framework of research would consist of two interconnected levels: (1) Searching for hyper parameters, such 
as hierarchical structures, in PARG, given empirical data and (2) Constructing the ad hoc realistic models, for 
example, the biomolecular environments in cell or the social-geographical structures in a city, which the PARG 
model is projected onto.
