Abstract
Given a solution to 4D Einstein gravity with an isometry direction, it is known
that the equations of motion are identical to those of a 3D σ-model with tar-
get space geometry SU(1, 1)/U(1).
Thus, any transformation by SU(1, 1) ∼=
SL(2, R) is a symmetry for the action and allows one to generate new solutions
in 4D. Here we clarify and extend recent work on electromagnetic (EM) duality in
the context of the classical double copy. In particular, for pure gravity, we identify
an explicit map between the Maxwell ﬁeld of the single copy and the scalars in the
target space, allowing us to identify the U(1) ⊂SL(2, R) symmetry dual to EM
duality in the single copy. Moreover, we extend the analysis to Einstein-Maxwell
theory, where we highlight the role of Ehlers-Harrison transformations and, for
spherically symmetric charged black hole solutions, we interpret the equations of
motion as a truncation of the putative single copy for Einstein-Yang-Mills theory.

Introduction
The classical double copy is an intriguing connection between gravity and gauge theory [1],
which has been motivated from a relationship between perturbative scattering amplitudes
in gauge theory and gravity [2–4] 1. In its simplest form, the central observation is that
solutions to Einstein gravity, or “the double copy”, can be mapped to solutions of Maxwell’s
equations 2, or “the single copy”, through a Kerr-Schild (KS) decomposition of the spacetime.
Interestingly, in contrast to Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, the KS ansatz maintains
dimensionality. More concretely, one considers the spacetime metric
gµν = ηµν + φ kµkν,
(1.1)
where ηµν denotes the metric of ﬂat spacetime, φ is a scalar and k is a null vector, kµkµ = 0,
satisfying the geodesic equation kρ∂ρkµ = 0. The Maxwell gauge ﬁeld A arises from the
identiﬁcation A = φ k. See [6–25] for related work in this direction.
In this double copy formalism the Schwarzschild solution corresponds to a Maxwell ﬁeld
with an electric charge [1], while the Taub-NUT solution possesses a magnetic charge [26].
Subsequently, the single copy of the Eguchi-Hanson instanton has been shown to map to
a self-dual Maxwell ﬁeld [27]. With both electric and magnetic charges present, this raises
the question whether there is a gravity analogue of electromagnetic (EM) duality, namely
a rotation of the ﬁeld strength F = dA into ∗F that honours the Maxwell equations of
motion. This was answered in the aﬃrmative in two recent papers. In the ﬁrst a complex
transformation in the gravity is mapped to a complexiﬁed BMS supertranslation [28], while
in the second [29] a class of real transformations due to Ehlers [30] (also Geroch [31]) are
exploited.
One goal of this work is to clarify comments in the latter paper. As we explain in the
following section, the magic of Ehlers transformations is that given 4D pure gravity with
a U(1) isometry direction, the equations of motion are identical to a 3D σ-model with
a target space H2.
Being maximally symmetric, the hyperbolic space H2 possesses an
isometry group SU(1, 1) ∼= SL(2, R) that rotates the scalars, but importantly leaves the 3D
eﬀective action, and therefore the equations of motion, invariant. Of these three SL(2, R)
transformations, one corresponds to a trivial shift that is pure gauge, a second to a constant
rescaling of the Killing vector of the U(1) isometry direction, while it is the third “Ehlers
transformation” 3 that is non-trivial in 4D. In section 2, we identify a linear combination
of these transformations as the appropriate U(1) transformation that is EM duality in the
single copy. Our lower-dimensional approach here should be contrasted with [29], where due
to the fact that one is working in 4D, the simplicity of the mapping between the single and
double copy is obscured. In short, Ehlers is simpler in 3D.
1See the recent review [5] and references therein for a wider perspective on this.
2Here Maxwell may be viewed as a linearisation of the Yang-Mills theory that features in perturbative
statements at the level of scattering amplitudes.
3Replacing H2 with AdS2, Ehlers is the analogue of a special conformal transformation, while the shift
is a translation and the scale symmetry is dilatation.
1

Concretely, in section 2 we rewrite the KS ansatz in a way appropriate for dimensional
reduction on a timelike direction. In essence, we are combining the classical double copy
in pure gravity with Kaluza-Klein reduction and the beauty of this approach is that a
manifest U(1) symmetry in 4D leads to an SL(2, R) symmetry in the lower-dimensional
theory. Through this process, we show how the electric and magnetic Maxwell ﬁeld strengths
of the single copy are related to the derivatives of the scalars of the 3D σ-model in the double
copy, thereby providing a succinct way to understand observations made in [29]. This map
between the scalars parametrising H2 and the Maxwell ﬂuxes allows us to deﬁne electric and
magnetic Maxwell charges at the level of the 3D eﬀective theory, which transform accordingly.
Our construction can be extended to a double KS ansatz, which makes us believe that it
holds for all stationary spacetimes admitting a KS decomposition.
The generalisation from Ehlers transformation to Ehlers-Harrison transformations [32] in
4D Einstein-Maxwell theory is immediate. Given the richer ﬁeld content in 4D, the sym-
metries of the target spacetime of the 3D σ-model are enhanced from SU(1, 1) →SU(2, 1)
[33–36]. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these enlarged symmetries in the double copy is
unclear. More precisely, despite a host of perturbative results at the level of scattering am-
plitudes [37–39] and radiation [40,41] suggesting that Einstein-Yang-Mills can be formulated
as the double copy of pure Yang-Mills and Yang-Mills coupled to a bi-adjoint scalar with
cubic potential, it is currently not known how to deﬁne the classical double copy for black
hole spacetimes where the metric, in particular the gtt term, scales with the radial direction
r as r−n, n > 1 4. This raises an interesting puzzle concerning the single copy interpretation
of charged black holes, especially black holes that are related to the Schwarzschild solution
through Ehlers-Harrison transformations. In the latter part of this work (section 3), we
identify the relevant equations of motions for a class of spherically symmetric charged black
holes and show that similar equations may be found from a truncation of the putative single
copy.
Concretely, we show through a generalised KS decomposition [42], that the equations
of motion for the Maxwell ﬁelds reduce to the same equations of motion evaluated on ﬂat
spacetime. Somewhat surprisingly, this implies that the Maxwell ﬁeld strength with a KS
ansatz is always a harmonic two-form on ﬂat spacetime!
Secondly, we observe that the
Harrison transformation, which turns on electric and/or magnetic charges in black holes,
is new to the double copy literature.
It should be noted that Harrison transformations
generate r−2 terms in the metric from r−1 expressions, thereby taking one outside of the
current classical double copy prescription. 5 Thirdly, we observe the same KS decomposition
allows us to interpret an additional equation as that of a truncation of the biadjoint scalar
equation [44], itself the expected single copy for Yang-Mills theory. This provides potentially
4See [24] for black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory and their interpretation in terms of
the single copy. The examples given are close cousins of the Schwarzschild solution in the sense that the gtt
term is linear in 1/r.
5We note that all 4D black holes at order G and charge e2 can be obtained from minimal coupling via
tree-level and one-loop triangle leading singularities [43]. Interestingly, the Harrison transformation is a
classical transformation that appears to rotate tree level and one-loop triangle diagrams into each other.

the ﬁrst hint of the biadjoint scalar equation beyond linear order in the classical double
copy approach. Finally, we illustrate how the Ehlers transformation once again plays the
counterpart of EM duality in this extended setting.

Ehlers and double copy
Here we follow the treatment described in appendix of [45] for pure gravity in 4D, which
serves as a warm-up for the later extension to Einstein-Maxwell theory.
Consider a 4D
spacetime with a Killing vector ∂t, which we will assume is in the temporal direction. The
most general metric consistent with this U(1) symmetry is
ds2 = −V (dt + A)2 + V −1γmndxmdxn,
(2.1)
where V is a scalar and A is a vector on the transverse 3D space with metric γmn, m, n =
1, 2, 3. We have rescaled the internal space judiciously so as to arrive later in Einstein frame
in 3D. Now, let us demand that this is a vacuum solution to Einstein gravity, so that it
satisﬁes the equation
Rµν = 0.
(2.2)
The joy of this set-up is that the equation mixing the temporal and spatial directions reduces
to
d(V 2 ∗3 F) = 0,
(2.3)
where F is the ﬁeld strength corresponding to the vector ﬁeld, F = dA. Now comes the
magic. Locally, one can replace the above equation with
V 2 ∗3 F = dχ,
(2.4)
where we have taken the opportunity to introduce a second scalar. The fact that we can do
this is essentially down to dimensionality: in 3D vectors are dual to scalars. Gathering the
remaining equations of motion together, it can be shown that the equations of motion follow
from varying the following 3D action
L = √γ

R −1
2
∂mV ∂mV + ∂mχ∂mχ
V 2

.
(2.5)
From the action it is evident that there is a hyperbolic target space H2. Being maximally
symmetric, it permits 3 Killing directions. To make these symmetries manifest, it is best to
switch to the complex scalar
τ = χ + iV,
(2.6)
which allows us to rewrite the metric on the hyperbolic space as
ds2(H2) = dV 2 + dχ2
V 2
= dτd¯τ
Im(τ)2.
(2.7)
3

It is now an easy task to conﬁrm that the 2D metric, and thus the 3D action, is invariant
under the SL(2, R) transformation
τ →τ ′ = aτ + b
cτ + d,
ad −bc = 1,
a, b, c, d, ∈R.
(2.8)
We believe that this is the simplest and most elegant way to present the class of transforma-
tions attributable to Ehlers/Geroch [30,31] 6. In appendix A we provide a coset description
for the same transformation.
Just so we are all on the same page, some comments are in order. First, the SL(2, R)
clearly rotates the scalars in the action, but does not aﬀect the 3D Ricci scalar. For this
reason, the 3D space with metric γmn is indeed invariant. Second, although we appear to
have three free parameters, the freedom to rescale the Killing vector by a constant and
the freedom to shift χ by a constant removes two of these parameters. In eﬀect, if one is
interested in generating new inequivalent solutions in 4D, one has only one parameter to
play with. To see this explicitly, it is worth observing that the following matrix corresponds
to transformations that are either pure gauge or can be removed by rescaling [31]:
 a
b
0
a−1

⊂SL(2, R).
(2.9)
Interestingly, as explicitly highlighted in [45], the same SL(2, R) symmetry is at the heart
of Lunin & Maldacena’s TsT transformations [46], and there one ﬁnds only one parameter,
in line with expectations. We explicitly check in appendix B that the most general SL(2, R)
transformation applied to the Schwarzschild solution leads to the Taub-NUT solution, i. e.
in addition to the mass, only one additional charge is generated. This further conﬁrms that
there is only one relevant parameter.
2.1
Kerr-Schild
Now comes a key point of this work. To fully understand the Ehlers transformation in terms
of the double copy, one should start with the KS ansatz and identify the scalar V and vector
ﬁeld A in terms of φ and the null vector k. The only problem is that nowhere in the KS
ansatz is a Killing direction speciﬁed, so we will have to put one in by hand. Luckily for us,
for stationary spacetimes, the most general null vector k can be decomposed as
k = dt + ˜k,
(2.10)
where ˜k is a spatial vector with unit norm ˜km˜km = 1. Once this is done, one can easily
identify the electric and magnetic part of the Maxwell ﬁeld,
Felec = dφ ∧dt,
Fmag = d(φ˜k),
(2.11)
6The reader is welcome to compare with sections 3 and 5 of the recent paper [29], where the same
transformation is discussed in 4D and the underlying simplicity is lost. It is helpful to note that τ = iσ.
4

where we have opted to use diﬀerential forms. Translated into the language of the earlier
dimensional reduction, one ﬁnds
V
=
(1 −φ),
A =
φ
1 −φ
˜k,
γmndxmdxn
=
(1 −φ)d⃗x2 + φ˜k2.
(2.12)
With this mapping, it is easy to identify the electric Maxwell ﬂux in terms of the derivative
of the scalar V :
Felec = −dV ∧dt.
(2.13)
The magnetic Maxwell ﬂux requires a little more work, but in the end takes a simple form.
Using the condition ˜kn∂n˜km = 0, it is a straightforward calculation (appendix C) to show
that
V 2 ∗3 F = ∗3Fmag,
(2.14)
where the Hodge duality on the l.h.s. is with respect to the metric γmn, whereas on the r.h.s.
the metric is δmn. Since the Maxwell ﬁeld is assumed to live in ﬂat spacetime, this is in line
with expectations. Now, returning to the key point in the Ehlers transformation, where the
vector is replaced by a scalar, we can write
∗3 Fmag = dχ.
(2.15)
Together (2.13) and (2.15) deﬁne an explicit mapping between the Maxwell ﬁeld strengths
in the single copy and the scalars of the 3D eﬀective description of pure gravity, namely the
double copy. Note, this is a general statement that holds for stationary spacetimes admitting
a KS description. This is one of our main results, which generalises statements in [29] beyond
explicit solutions.
2.2
EM duality
At this juncture it should be clear that any transformation of the scalars under SL(2, R) is
mapped into a transformation in the Maxwell ﬁelds. The task remains to identify the precise
linear combination of SL(2, R) generators corresponding to EM duality, or more concretely,
the following transformation:
G →e2iβG,
G ≡F + i ∗4 F,
(2.16)
where β is a constant parameter, which ensures the equations dF = d ∗4 F = 0 hold.
The search for this constant parameter is made easy by the fact that, as explained earlier,
there is only one relevant parameter, so the most general SL(2, R) transformation may be
expressed as
 a
b
c
d

=

cos β
sin β
−sin β
cos β

.
(2.17)
5

Expanding this transformation for small β, we see that it is generated by a combination
of Ehlers/shift and gives rise to a rescaling, but as explained, the non-trivial solution gen-
erating element is coming from the Ehlers transformation. We have opted for this form
of transformation as it preserves V →1 asymptotically, which is a necessary condition for
the spacetime to be asymptotically ﬂat. Then, bearing in mind that χ can be shifted by
a constant, asymptotically one has V = 1 + M/r + . . . and χ = N/r + . . . , where M, N
denote constant charges (see appendix B for the relevant expressions for the Schwarzschild
spacetime). The requirement that V = 1 asymptotically is enough to ﬁx c2 + d2 = 1 and
the form (2.17) follows from the constraint ad −bc = 1. Ultimately, this guarantees that
the charges rotate in the expected manner in line with (2.16). Therefore, the asymptotic
condition V = 1 is enough to ﬁx (2.17) uniquely. 7
Returning to the above transformation (2.17), we can now comment on some special cases.
The choice β = π
4 generates the pure NUT space, while β = π
2 executes the Buchdahl recip-
rocal transformation [49]. In contrast to [29], there is no need to rescale to the Schwarzschild
metric 8 or treat the Buchdahl transformation separately: everything naturally ﬁts into
SL(2, R). It is worth noting that above we have assumed a KS ansatz, but it turns out
that the above relations (2.13) and (2.15) are robust. In appendix C we show that if one
replaces a single KS ansatz with the double KS ansatz 9, then the same relations hold. In
essence, provided the spacetime admits a (double) KS description, which we should recall
is the key assumption in the classical double copy narrative, then we can relate the electric
and magnetic ﬂuxes in the single copy to scalars in a 3D σ-model through (2.13) and (2.15).
It is worth stressing again that (2.15) only holds for KS spacetimes.
Nevertheless, there is an important caveat to our treatment here. It is not guaranteed that
Ehlers transformations preserve the KS description and the classiﬁcation of such solutions
is an open problem. In fact, even an Ehlers transformation applied to the Schwarzschild
solution does not preserve the single KS description, but the resulting Taub-NUT spacetime
admits a more general double KS description [26]. For this reason, solutions preserving a
strict KS description are expected to be constrained: Schwarzschild is precluded! Of course,
if the transformed geometry is not KS, then the classical double copy narrative fails to apply.
Thus, only for spacetimes where the Ehlers transformation honours the KS description 10
can one interpret Ehlers in the double copy as EM duality in the single copy. It should
be noted that related statements on EM duality in the single copy are very much solution
dependent (Schwarzschild →Taub-NUT) [28, 29], so our analysis here is in principle more
7Now, the astute reader will note that Ehlers is inherently a non-linear transformation, which is expected
in gravity. This then implies that the Maxwell ﬁelds deﬁned in (2.13) and (2.15) are also transformed non-
linearly under (2.17). Nevertheless, as can be shown for explicit solutions (see subsection 3.3, appendix B
or [29]), such non-linearity can be removed by coordinate transformation. For this reason, we expect that
(2.17) recovers (2.16) up to a coordinate transformation and that this can be checked on a case-by-case basis.
8This rescaling can be viewed as yet another SL(2, R) transformation where d = 1/a. To make comparison
with the Taub-NUT geometry presented in [48], and reproduced in section 3 of [29], note that sin2 β =
c2
1
1+c2
1 .
9The Plebanski-Demianski family of metrics [50] admits a double KS ansatz once the coordinates are
complexiﬁed, so this is in principle a large class.
10It can be single or double KS.
6

general, albeit the classiﬁcation of Ehlers-invariant KS spacetimes is an open problem we do
not address.
Setting this important caveat aside, provided one is careful about the asymptotics, it is
possible to deﬁne electric and magnetic Maxwell charges in the usual manner:
Qe = 1
4π
Z
S2 ∗3dV,
Qm = 1
4π
Z
S2 ∗3dχ.
(2.18)
To the extent of our knowledge these charges are new in the double copy literature, but are
not new in general (see for example [51], equation (2.9)). This constitutes our second key
result. We can motivate the charges both physically and mathematically. Physically, the
Maxwell ﬁelds strengths of the single copy are deﬁned in ﬂat spacetime and we have seen that
they are related to the scalars through (2.13) and (2.15). Moreover, we have removed the
temporal direction, so this means we are restricted to the 3D ﬂat metric ds2 = dr2+r2ds2(S2).
Thus, this motivates the integrals on purely physical grounds.
However, we can also rigorously deﬁne the asymptotics mathematically. To do so, let us
momentarily redeﬁne the scalar V →eφ, so that the scalar equations of motion become
d
 ∗3dφ −2e−2φχ ∗3 dχ

=
0,
d(e−2φ ∗3 dχ)
=
0.
(2.19)
Being conserved quantities, the two-forms in the brackets are suitable for deﬁning charges
and can be integrated over a closed 2D submanifold. Clearly if V →1 (φ →0) and χ →0
asymptotically as r →∞, then we recover the charges deﬁned above. As is clear from the
4D metric (3.14), V = 1 is a necessary condition for the metric to be asymptotically ﬂat,
whereas χ = 0 can be easily imposed by exploiting the translational (gauge) symmetry.
Let us return the example considered in [29] to which we will apply our general one-
parameter rotation (2.17). The data describing the Schwarzschild solution is
V =

1 −2M
r

,
(2.20)
and χ is a constant, so there is no vector ﬁeld A in the gravity. Translated into the single
copy Maxwell ﬁeld, the Schwarzschild solution has only an electric ﬂux. In this case we have
Qe = 2M,
Qm = 0.
(2.21)
Performing the SL(2, R) transformation, we generate new scalars and from there we read oﬀ
the transformed charges,
Q′
e = 2M cos 2β,
Q′
m = −2M sin 2β.
(2.22)
As a further simple example, it is easy to convince oneself that the Buchdahl reciprocal
transformation [49] ﬂips the sign of electric charge.

Ehlers-Harrison and double copy
Admittedly, the presentation in the last section has been to the point, but probably a bit
quick - we did not provide any details of the dimensional reduction - and some subtleties may
still require teasing out. So, in this section we extend the analysis to the Einstein-Maxwell
theory in 4D and work with explicit solutions. The motivation comes from the observation
that charged black holes permit a generalised KS description 11, a feature we will explain
in due course. But before going there, let us explain how the assumption that solutions to
Einstein-Maxwell theory in 4D admit a single U(1) Killing vector leads to a hidden SU(2, 1)
symmetry in 3D. See [52] for seminal work in this direction.
Let us start with the 4D action
L4 = √−g

R −1
4FαβF αβ

,
(3.1)
where F = dA is the ﬁeld strength for a Maxwell gauge ﬁeld A. Now, consider the following
ansatz for the spacetime metric and one-form,
ds2
4
=
−V (dt + A)2 + V −1γmndxmdxn,
A
=
f(dt + A) + B
⇒
F = df ∧(dt + A) + fF + H,
(3.2)
where we have further deﬁned F = dA and H = dB. Up to the inclusion of the scalar f and
vector B, this is the same ansatz as before. Now performing the dimensional reduction at
the level of the action by simply inserting the ansatz, while leaving a demonstration of the
consistency to appendix D, we arrive at the 3D action:
L
=
√γ

R −
1
2V 2(∂V )2 + 1
4V 2F 2 −1
4V (fF + H)2 + 1
2V (∂f)2

.
(3.3)
Varying this action with respect to the vectors A and B, one gets the following equations of
motion:
d (V ∗3 (fF + H))
=
0,
(3.4)
d(V 2 ∗F) −V df ∧∗(fF + H)
=
0.
(3.5)
It is worth noting at this point that the exterior derivative of the second equation is consistent
with the ﬁrst equation and that truncating f = B = 0 we recover the equation (2.3). With
the equations of motion at hand, we are now in a position to dualise the vectors through the
following redeﬁnitions:
V ∗3 (fF + H)
=
dω
(3.6)
V 2 ∗3 F
=
dχ + 1
2(fdω −ωdf),
(3.7)
11This possibility has already been noticed in [11] within the context of the classical double copy.
8

where the reader should note that the equations of motion still hold, so once again everything
is consistent. Care should be taken with the sign of the kinetic terms since in 3D spacetime
∗3∗3 = −1, so we eventually end up with a scalar manifold of signature (+, +, −, −). At this
point we are in a position to import various existing older results in the literature [33–36]
(see [53] for an overview) through simple ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. Concretely, we can redeﬁne as
follows,
V = eξ,
f =
√
2v,
ω =
√
2u
(3.8)
to bring the target spacetime manifold to the form [36]:
ds2 = 1
2[dξ2 + e−2ξ(dχ + vdu −udv)2] −e−ξ(dv2 + du2).
(3.9)
Once again, we recover the analysis of the previous section when v = u = 0.
With the target spacetime identiﬁed, we can now enumerate the symmetries. The most
trivial correspond to the three shift symmetries
χ
→
χ + c,
v
→
v + c,
χ →χ −c u,
u
→
u + c,
χ →χ + c v,
(3.10)
where c is a constant. In addition, we have a pretty obvious rotational symmetry in the
(u, v) plane, which is the usual EM duality exchanging electric and magnetic ﬂuxes in the
Einstein-Maxwell theory. Although a little less obvious from the 4D perspective, we have
the rescaling symmetry,
ξ →ξ + c,
u →e
c
2u,
v →e
c
2v,
χ →ecχ.
(3.11)
The remaining three transformations ﬂeshing out the SU(2, 1) symmetry of the target space-
time are less obvious, but as explained in [36] are best described through the introduction
of (complex) Ernst potentials:
Φ = 1
√
2(v + iu),
E = eξ + iχ −ΦΦ∗.
(3.12)
Then to read oﬀthe transformed target spacetime, one simply has to unravel a complex
Harrison transformation
Φ′ =
Φ + λE
1 −2λ∗Φ −|λ|2E ,
E′ =
E
1 −2λ∗Φ −|λ|2E ,
(3.13)
and a real Ehlers transformation,
Φ′ =
Φ
1 + iγE ,
E′ =
E
1 + iγE .
(3.14)
into constituent components.

3.1
Maxwell ﬁelds in KS spacetimes
We begin our analysis by discussing the implications of a KS decomposition for the equations
of motion of the Maxwell ﬁeld strength. Note that the equations of motion following from
the action (3.1) are
d ∗F = 0,
Rµ
ν = 1
2F µ
ρF ρ
ν −1
8δµ
νF 2.
(3.15)
First, let us observe that the Hodge dual in KS spacetimes may be explicitly written in terms
of coordinates as

(3.16)
where in the second line we have used the fact the inverse of the metric (1.1) is linear in φ
and det(g) = det(η). We have also raised and lowered indices using the metric ηµν. In the
third line we have used the result kµFµν ∝kν 12 to convince ourselves that the φ-dependent
terms must cancel. Thus, the Hodge dual of a two-form on a KS spacetime is equivalent to
the Hodge dual on ﬂat spacetime. This means that the Maxwell ﬁeld strength is a harmonic
two-form on ﬂat spacetime and this is a generic feature for all KS spacetimes. We expect
similar conclusions to hold for diﬀerential forms of diﬀerent dimensionality.
Next let us turn our focus to the r.h.s. of the Einstein equation. Using arguments similar
to above, which essentially follow from the fact that k is null, one can show that the r.h.s.
reduces to the same expression but evaluated once again on ﬂat spacetime, i. e.
Rµ

(3.17)
In summary, provided a KS description exists, the Maxwell equations of motion are reduced
to those of ﬂat spacetime. This constitutes a remarkable simpliﬁcation.
3.2
A puzzle with the single copy
Having spelled out the implications for the Maxwell ﬁeld, we turn our attention to what we
will refer to as a generalised KS description [42], where we use “generalised” in the sense
that the scalar in the pure gravity KS ansatz picks up a component that depends on the
Maxwell ﬁelds. Here, we quickly conﬁrm that any black hole solution with purely diagonal
12One can show this by recalling A = φk and using the null condition kµkµ = 0 and the geodesic equation
kµ∂µkν = 0 to show that kµFµν = (kµ∂µφ)kν.

metric components gtt = grr = f(r) can be brought to a KS form. We follow the treatment
in [29]. Consider the redeﬁnition
dl = dt + dr
f(r),
(3.18)
so that the metric becomes
ds2 = −f(r)dl2 + 2dldr + r2ds2(S2).
(3.19)
Then further redeﬁning l = ¯t + r, we can bring the metric to the generalised KS form:
ds2 = −d¯t2 + dr2 + r2ds2(S2) + (1 −f(r)) (d¯t + dr)2.
(3.20)
Let us now be more speciﬁc and consider the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole where
f(r) = 1 −2M
r
+ Q2
r2 .
(3.21)
As we show in appendix E this solution, as well as its dyonic generalisation, can be gen-
erated from Schwarzschild by employing a Harrison transformation.
In some sense, the
Schwarzschild solution and the RN solution are no longer independent, they are related by
a rotation in the eﬀective 3D target manifold.
From the perspective of scattering amplitudes this is an interesting result 13. Let us explain
why. In [43] it is shown that to recover the Schwarzschild and RN black hole solutions at
leading order in G and e2 through minimal coupling one requires respectively tree-level and
one-loop triangle leading singularities.
In eﬀect, the existence of a simple rotation from
Schwarzschild to the RN solution suggests that some hint of the same symmetry should
exist perturbatively at the level of scattering amplitudes. Thus, the existence of Harrison
transformations also has implications for amplitudes.
Now this brings us to an interesting observation. As noted in [11], we are in a position to
split the scalar φ into a purely gravitational part φg and a part that is electromagnetic in
origin φem, φ = φg + φem, where φg ∼r−1 and φem ∼r−2. As we have already shown the
Maxwell ﬁeld strength is a harmonic two-form on ﬂat spacetime, which means that the r.h.s.
of the Einstein equation scales as F 2 ∼r−4. This term is cancelled by the φem term as we
now explicitly demonstrate.
Recall that once a spacetime is written in KS format, the l.h.s of the Einstein equation
becomes [1]:

Explicitly for the RN solution and the ﬁrst Einstein equation, we ﬁnd the equation 14:

(3.23)
where similar expressions exist for the remaining equations.
Since the Laplace operator
is deﬁned with respect to ﬂat spacetime, it is clear that the Einstein equation is satisﬁed
through two diﬀerent equations that are schematically of the form
∇2φg ∼0,
∇2φem ∼φ2
em.
(3.24)
While the ﬁrst equation is just the expected term from the classical double copy for pure
gravity [1], where it is interpreted as the Maxwell equation, the second equation is intriguing.
Although we have focussed on the RN solution, essentially for illustrative purposes, it should
be stressed that our observations here extend to dyonic black holes with spherical symmetry.
Moreover, when the electric and magnetic charges agree, the corresponding solution is not
only a solution to Einstein-Maxwell theory, but also Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory.
Let us try to interpret these equations in terms of the putative single copy. To do so,
we recall that at the perturbative level Einstein-Yang-Mills should be the double copy of
Yang-Mills and a bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld with a cubic potential [37–39]. Let us start from the
single copy action presented in equation (4.5) of [37]:

(3.26)
Following [41], we have dropped an O(g2) quartic scalar term in the action on the grounds
that it is not needed for the double copy. One should note that g′ is arbitrary and dimension-
ful, while g and f ˆa
ˆbˆc denote the coupling and structure constants for the gauge group. The
rank-three tensor Fabc has entries that are given by the structure constants of a subgroup of
SO(n). We refer the reader to [37] for further details.
The corresponding equations of motion for the action (3.25) may be expressed as

(3.28)
Let us now put these equations in context. First, one can consistently truncate out the
scalars through φˆaa = 0 and one arrives at Yang-Mills theory through (3.28), which is the
14In our conventions the ﬁeld strength is F = 2 Q

12

expected single copy for pure gravity, at least in the classical double copy prescription 15.
Alternatively, one could try to truncate out the gauge ﬁelds. Doing so, one recovers the
biadjoint scalar equation from (3.27),
∇2φˆaa = gg′
2! ifˆaˆbˆcFabcφ
ˆbbφˆcc,
(3.29)
but unfortunately the consistency of this truncation is spoiled by the ﬁnal term in (3.28) and
one is left with a constraint on φ, f
ˆb
ˆaˆcφˆca∂νφˆba = 0. Modulo this constraint, one recovers
the biadjoint scalar equation on the nose, which it should be stressed is the expected single
copy for Yang-Mills theory. The key point we wish to stress here is that one can almost
disentangle the equations into the single copy for gravity and the single copy for Yang-Mills.
Now, let us recall that in the original classical double copy formulation [1], one interprets
the zeroth copy, or the ∇2φ = 0 equation, as simply a linearisation of the biadjoint scalar
equation (3.29). It is valid to ask if one can go further. Here, we can follow the analysis of [44]
and adopt a spherical ansatz for the scalar φˆaa = δˆaaφ, while at the same time identifying the
structure constants fˆaˆbˆc and iFabc, which for simplicity could be identiﬁed with the structure
constants of the Lie algebra g = su(2) 16. This condition is enough to solve the constraint
remaining from (3.28), so that (3.27) reduces to the required additional equation on the right
hand side of (3.24).
Note, throughout the above discussion we omitted the gauge ﬁelds, but these can be
reintroduced and truncated through the choice Aa = A ⇒F a = F. This would seem to
interfere with the biadjoint scalar equation (3.27), but for the choice of conﬁgurations we
consider, namely spherically symmetric charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory, one
can conﬁrm that ∂µAµ = Aµ∂µφ = 0 is always true. To appreciate this fact, note that
φ is a function of the radial direction, whereas A is the Maxwell ﬁeld inferred from the
metric, which for any charged black hole related to Schwarzschild through a Harrison-Ehlers
transformation will only possess At and Aφ components.
Let us summarise our discussions here.
We observed that any spherically symmetric
solution to Einstein-Maxwell theory could be put generalised KS form. Doing so, one observes
that the mass and the charges have to cancel separately through two distinct equations. One
of these is the original equation from the classical double copy and this suﬃces to explain
metrics with r−1 scaling. We have argued that the additional equation can be recovered
from the equations of motion of the putative single copy to Einstein-Yang-Mills via a well-
deﬁned truncation procedure. In particular, this truncation allows one to avoid the usual
linearisation of the biadjoint scalar equation [1].
15Strictly speaking, one would expect the bosonic sector of supergravity, i.e. gµν, Bµν and φ, as in the
perturbative double copy, but B and φ are not relevant in our example.
16As noted in [44], the more general choice φˆaa = χˆaξa leads to a vanishing of the cubic term and a
resulting free ﬁeld theory.

3.3
Ehlers transformation
Our goal in this subsection is to show how the nontrivial Ehlers transformation (3.14) is
EM duality in the extended setting of Einstein-Maxwell theory. This should be contrasted
with the trivial form of EM duality where one exploits the rotational symmetry in the (v, u)
directions of the target spacetime. Concretely, let us start with the dyonic solution (E.10)
and generate a new geometry with electric, magnetic and NUT charge. After performing an
Ehlers transformation (3.14) and a rescaling, the ﬁnal data becomes:
ǫξ
=
(r2 −2Mr + Q2 + P 2)ec
r2 + γ2(r −2M)2

χ = −
γ(r −2M)2ec
r2 + γ2(r −2M)2,

u = −

2(Pr −γQ(r −2M))e
c
2
r2 + γ2(r −2M)2
.
(3.30)
Translating from the 3D target spacetime to the 4D solution to Einstein-Maxwell, we arrive
at the following solution:
ds2

−eξ(dt + A)2 + e−ξ  dr2 + r2f(r)ds2(S2)

(3.31)
where we have deﬁned
A = 4Me−cγ cos θdφ,
B = −2e−c
2(P −γQ) cos θdφ.
(3.32)
By performing the following transformations [29],
ec = 1 + γ2,
N = 2γM
1 + γ2,
r −Nγ = ρ,
M′ = M 1 −γ2
1 + γ2.
(3.33)
we can bring it to the form:
ds2

(dt + 2N cos θdφ)2

ρ(Q + γP) −N(P −γQ)
ρ2 + N2
(dt + 2N cos θdφ) + (P −γQ) cos θdφ

,
where we have performed the following further redeﬁnitions
Q + γP
p
1 + γ2 →Q,
P −γQ
p
1 + γ2 →P,
(3.35)
so that we recover the RN-Taub-NUT solution of [54] with g = 0 (see also [55] for the purely
electric solution).
14

At this point we are again in a position to comment on the Maxwell charges in the double
copy. However, there are some small diﬀerences, which we now outline, otherwise the basic
idea is the same. In our earlier section we showed that (2.15) held in the absence of a Maxwell
ﬁeld. As explained above, the Maxwell ﬁeld in the double copy formalism is essentially a
Maxwell ﬁeld inferred from the metric, which sources a scalar potential φg in a generalised
KS description. Since this is purely a quantity we deﬁne at the level of the metric, the
Maxwell ﬁelds in Einstein-Maxwell do not aﬀect this deﬁnition. For this reason, (2.15) is
generalised to
∗3 Fmag = V 2 ∗3 F = dχ + vdu −udv,
(3.36)
where as before Hodge duality is performed on diﬀerent spaces. It is worth noting that in the
original dyonic solution (E.10) this term is not sourced, so the Maxwell ﬁeld in the double
copy is purely electric. However, once we perform an Ehlers transformation, as we have seen
above, χ, u and v become non-zero, so this term makes a contribution. Taking into account
the rescaling, we ﬁnd that the electric and magnetic ﬂux are
Qe = 1
4π
Z
S2 ∗3dV = 2M′,
Qm = 1
4π
Z
S2 ∗3(dχ + vdu −udv) = −2N,
(3.37)
where it can checked that u, v have the correct asymptotic form, i. e. u, v →0 as r →∞, thus
ensuring that our deﬁntion of the charges is once again consistent with the scalar equations
of motion. Note, these charges are purely gravitational and should not be confused with
P, Q, which are electromagnetic in nature.
It is worth noting that since N2 + M′2 = M2, or alternatively since the NUT charge N
combines with the new mass M′ to recover the original mass of the black hole M, both the
electric and magnetic Maxwell charges have been transformed from the original Schwarzschild
geometry.
Finally, following the arguments similar to [56], where a class of solutions to
Einstein-Maxwell in Plebanski formalism [57] are studied, one can convince oneself that the
above metric can be brought to a generalised double KS description.

Conclusions
In the earlier part of this work we married the KS ansatz of pure gravity with a natural
4D to 3D dimensional reduction, which allowed us to identify the Maxwell ﬁeld strengths of
the double copy formalism directly in terms of the scalars parametrising a hyperbolic coset
geometry in 3D. As we have argued, this can be done for generic spacetime geometries and it
is the rotation of the scalars under a U(1) ⊂SL(2, R) that is mapped to EM duality in the
Maxwell ﬂuxes of the double copy formalism. We believe our work clariﬁes and generalises
to stationary spacetimes admitting a (double) KS form, the ﬁndings presented earlier in [29].
In the latter part of this work, we extended our ﬁndings to Einstein-Maxwell theory in
4D. To do so, we identiﬁed the 3D σ-model with SU(2, 1) symmetry, and tried to interpret
the equations of motion of Einstein-Maxwell theory, at least in the context of spherically
symmetric charged black holes, in terms of the equations of motion of the putative single
15

copy. In particular, starting form the putative single copy for Einstein-Yang-Mills [37, 41],
we showed that a truncation exists whereby one not only recovers the usual classical double
copy prescription that allows for r−1 terms in the metric, but also an additional equation
that corresponds to the r−2 terms. As we explained, the latter is a truncation of the biadjoint
scalar equation constituting the expected single copy for Yang-Mills theory, thus generalising
the zeroth copy of ref. [1]. That being said, it should be stressed here that we are not claiming
that Einstein-Maxwell has a single copy description, only that one can ﬁnd an interpretation
of the the equations of motion for spherically symmetric charged black holes in Einstein-
Maxwell within the putative single copy for Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. This is simply a
statement about the existence of a truncation, but whether or not it is coincidental requires
further investigation.
Our work raises a number of interesting future directions. First, it is clear that EM du-
ality in the double copy can be realised in terms of BMS symmetries [28] and our analysis
shows EM duality is also related to Ehlers transformations (see also [29]), so the task re-
mains to connect Ehlers transformations to BMS symmetries directly in pure gravity, before
potentially extending to Einstein-Maxwell theory or equivalent. On that note, an interesting
recent paper [58] discusses dualities in linearised gravity and it is conceivable that this is
the Ehlers transformation at the non-linear level once a Killing direction is assumed. More-
over, the connection in section 3.2 is intriguing and we should endeavour to extend it to
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, a setting where the (classical) double copy is expected to
be on ﬁrmer footing.
It would be interesting to extend the results presented here to asymptotically (anti)-de
Sitter spacetimes. That being said, the simplest generalisation of introducing a cosmological
constant does not work. To see why, let us return to (2.5) and observe that the inclusion of
a cosmological constant in 4D leads to a 3D cosmological constant dressed by a V −1 factor.
As observed in [59] (see also [60]), demanding that the 3D action is invariant forces one
to consider SL(2, R) transformations that are pure gauge (2.9). Nevertheless, extensions
to diﬀerent dimensions appear pretty immediate. Indeed, there are numerous examples of
supergravity theories - where the classical double copy story is being actively studied [23–25]
- that can be truncated to scalar sectors and similar symmetries arise.

B
General SL(2, R) transformation
In this section we comment on the general SL(2, R) transformation applied to Schwarzschild
with a goal to convince ourselves that of the three unconstrained SL(2, R) parameters,
only one is relevant after various redeﬁnitions. Recall the most general form of a SL(2, R)
transformation is given by (2.8). For the Schwarzschild solution we have
V = 1 −2M
r ,
χ = 0,
(B.1)
so under the SL(2, R) transformation we get following expressions for V ′ and χ′,
V ′ =
r(r −2M)
c2(r −2M)2 + d2r2,
χ′ = ac(r −2M)2 + bdr2
c2(r −2M)2 + d2r2 .
(B.2)
Using (2.4) the two form F takes following form
F = 4dcMvol(S2) .
(B.3)
Finally the 4D metric can be written as
ds2 = −
r(r −2M)
c2(r −2M)2 + d2r2 (dt + 4Mdc cos θdϕ)2 + c2(r −2M)2 + d2r2
r(r −2M)

(B.4)
where we have deﬁned,
ds2
3 = dr2 + r(r −2M)(dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2).
(B.5)
In above metric only two of independent parameters of SL(2, R) appear. Indeed one can
show that one of these parameters can be also eliminated by a shift and a rescaling of both
the radial and time coordinates. If we deﬁne two positive parameters r± by

C
Double KS
In this section we provide some details to support the identity (2.15). We work with a double
KS ansatz for greater generality. Consider the double KS ansatz:
gµν = ηµν + φkµkν + ψlµlν,
(C.1)
where kµ and lµ satisfy following equations,
ηµνkµkν = gµνkµkν = 0,
ηµνlµlν = gµνlµlν = 0,
ηµνkµlν = gµνkµlν = 0,
kµ∂µkν = 0,
lµ∂µlν = 0
(C.2)
Assuming ∂t is a Killing direction, we can always write
k = dt + ˜k,
l = dt + ˜l.
(C.3)
Rewriting everything in terms of the earlier ansatz (3.14) gives
V = 1 −φ −ψ,
A = −V −1 
φ˜k + ψ˜l

(C.4)
and the 3D metric ds2
3 becomes
ds2
3 = γmndxmdxn = V (dx2
i + φ˜k2 + ψ˜l2) + (φ˜k + ψ˜l)2
(C.5)
To ﬁnd the Hodge dual, ﬁrst we need to invert the above metric. It is easy to show that the
inverse metric is
γmn = (1 −φ −ψ)−1 
δmn −φ˜km˜kn −ψ˜lm˜ln
.
(C.6)
where we deﬁned ˜km and ˜lm by
˜km = δmn˜kn,
˜lm = δmn˜ln.
(C.7)
Now, using (C.4) and (C.2) we get
(V 2 ∗3 F)p = −2∂m(φ˜kn + ψ˜ln)ǫmnp
(C.8)
which can be further rewritten as (2.15). Although we have not performed the calculation,
there is nothing that suggests the same analysis will not work for a KS ansatz with three
null vectors.
D
Consistency of dimensional reduction
In this section, we show that the dimensional reduction of 4D Einstein-Maxwell theory on
a temporal direction leads to the four-dimensional target spacetime in the text. We will
19

perform this reduction at the level of the action and equations of motion (EOMs), thereby
demonstrating consistency. The EOMs of the action (3.1) are
Rµν −1

FµρF ρ

(D.1)
Now, we can reduce to 3D through the ansatz 17:

−e2V (dt + A)2 + ds2
3,
A
=
f(dt + A) + B
⇒
F = df ∧(dt + A) + fF + H,
(D.2)
where we have further deﬁned F = dA and H = dB.
For the reduction to 3D, we have the Ricci tensor,

(D.4)
Note that this action is not in Einstein frame, but performing the conformal transformation
g3 →e−2V γ brings it to the form quoted in the text once V is redeﬁned. It turns out that
the truncation is consistent as we now demonstrate.
First, observe that 4D Maxwell EOM leads to the two equations in 3D:

These equations follow from the action (D.4) upon varying with respect to B and f, respec-
tively, so the action passes the ﬁrst test. Note, the ﬁrst equation will allow us introduce a
scalar.

One can check that (D.7) follows from the action (D.4) by varying V , while (D.8) follows from
(D.4) by varying with respect to A. Finally, it can be checked that the Einstein equation
follows from the action. This demonstrates the consistency of the reduction, which is modulo
a conformal transformation the same as the action (3.3) quoted in the text.
E
Harrison transformation
Since these transformations may look new to a hep-th readership, let’s get oriented by de-
scribing an explicit example. To begin, let us ﬁrst assume ξ ̸= 0, which is enough to describe a
Schwarzschild solution, and generate a dyonic solution through a complex Harrison transfor-
mation. To preserve asymptotic ﬂatness, as we did previously for the Ehlers transformation
in pure gravity, we will also perform a scale transformation. More concretely, we will consider
λ = κeiα.
(E.1)
After the transformation, the solution is
v = κ cos α
√
2eξ0e
c
2
1 −κ2eξ0
,
u = κ sin α
√
2eξ0e
c
2
1 −κ2eξ0
, ,
eξ =
eξ0ec
(1 −κ2eξ0)2,
(E.2)
where c is a scaling parameter we have introduced and ξ0 denotes the original data, in this
case the Schwarzschild solution:
eξ0 = 1 −2M
r .
(E.3)
The ﬁrst thing to note is that this transformation is a symmetry of the target spacetime and
one can check that
1
2dξ2 −e−ξ(dv2 + du2) = 1
2dξ2
0.
(E.4)
Since the 3D eﬀective action is invariant, this guarantees a new solution in 4D and the task
remains to identify the explicit form of the ﬁnal solution. Evaluating all expressions, and
performing Hodge dualities where necessary to identify the vector ﬁelds, we ﬁnd that the
ﬁnal solution may be expressed as,
ds2
=
−
ecr(r −2M)
(r(1 −κ2) + 2Mκ2)2dt2 + (r(1 −κ2) + 2Mκ2)2
ecr(r −2M)

dr2 + r(r −2M)ds2(S2)

,
A
=
2e
c
2κ cos α(r −2M)
r(1 −κ2) + 2Mκ2 dt −e−c
2κ sin α 4M cos θdφ.
(E.5)
This is still rather unsightly and to bring it to a more appealing form, one should consider
the following change in the radial coordinate and accompanying judicious choice for the
rescaling,
e
c
2 ˜r = r(1 −κ2) + 2Mκ2,
ec = (1 −κ2)2.
(E.6)
21

With these substitutions, we can simply drop tildes on the radial coordinate and recast the
solution as
ds2
=
−f(r)dt2 +
1
f(r)dr2 + r2ds2(S2),
A
=
2κ cos α

1 −
2M
r(1 −κ2)

dt −
κ
(1 −κ2) sin α 4M cos θdφ,
(E.7)
where we have further deﬁned
f(r) = 1 −2M(1 + κ2)
r(1 −κ2)
+
4M2κ2
r2(1 −κ2)2.
(E.8)
Observe that the rescaling was instrumental to recover ﬂat asymptotics and that the ﬁnal
solution can be brought to a more familiar form through the redeﬁnitions,
M′ = M(1 + κ2)
(1 −κ2) ,
Q = κ cos α2M
(1 −κ2) ,
P = κ sin α2M
(1 −κ2) ,
(E.9)
so that we arrive at the ﬁnal expression:
ds2
=
−f(r)dt2 +
1
f(r)dr2 + r2ds2(S2),
A
=
−2Q
r dt −2P cos θdφ,
f(r) = 1 −2M
r
+ Q2 + P 2
r2
.
(E.10)
Note, we have dropped a prime on M and also a constant in the electric component of A
that was pure gauge.
On the whole, this is more or less as may have been expected. We have seen that when
pure Einstein gravity is coupled to Maxwell theory in 4D, we have a larger class of hidden
symmetries upon dimensional reduction on a U(1) Killing direction. Within this class, one
ﬁnds the class of transformations originally identiﬁed by Harrison [32], which provides a
means to generate charged black hole solutions from the Schwarzschild solution. Here, we
have opted for a complex transformation, so that the resulting geometry is dyonic, but a real
Harrison transformation in tandem with a rotation in the (u, v)-plane of the target spacetime
achieves the same result. We emphasise once again the role of a rescaling transformation in
maintaining the asymptotics.
