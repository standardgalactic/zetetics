SUMMARY 
 
The performance of digital computers has begun to saturate due to material, size, 
and power limitations. In addition to solving these dilemmas, new computing paradigms 
are being investigated. This thesis explores neuromorphic computing as a possible new 
computational paradigm, specifically an all hardware approach based on biological neural 
processing. Chapter 1 introduces neuromorphic computing, neurobiology, memristive 
devices for neuromorphic computing, and the memristive material lithium niobite 
(LiNbO2). 
 
Chapters 2 discusses the synthesis of lithium niobite by room temperature 
sputtering as well as some basic physical, optical, chemical, and electrical properties. 
Chapters 3 and 4 explore more complex properties of lithium niobite including the effects 
of high energy radiation on lithium niobite devices and the effects of light interacting 
with the mobile ions in lithium niobite. 
 
Chapters 5 – 7 discuss three devices useful for mimicking sub-structures within a 
biological neuron. These devices are two-terminal lithium niobite memristors, lithium 
niobite based batteries, and a new memdiode based on Nb2O5. Chapter 8 returns to the 
synthesis of lithium niobite, but in the form of bulk wafers, and discusses their potential 
application toward replicating the “sea of ions” surrounding biological neurons. 
 
Chapters 9 and 10 conclude this thesis by discussing device models for lithium 
niobite memristors and their application in several neuromorphic circuits to add 
biologically realistic behavior without increasing the complexity of the circuit.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Historical and Fundamental Limitations in CMOS Computing 
 
Semiconductor electronics revolutionized the computing industry by providing 
inexpensive, reliable, and scalable components for both the memory and arithmetic 
processing functions of a computer. Since their initial introduction, the periodic reduction 
in transistor size, termed Moore’s Law [1], has yielded computer processors with more 
transistors, increased speed, and increased functionality. Since the first commercial 
integrated circuit was introduced in 1964 [2], this microelectronic scaling has enabled a 
wide range of new technologies in diverse markets such as communications, 
entertainment, security, energy, transportation, and healthcare [3, 4].  
While the exponential growth of microelectronic circuit densities has driven 
decades of economic growth, industry [4] and academic [5] studies predict the end of 
Moore’s Law scaling within the next 10 – 20 years due to leakage currents encountered 
in nanoscale devices [4-7]. As early as 2006, leakage currents were reported to consume 
20 – 30% of a CMOS processor’s power [5]. The thermal limitations imposed by these 
leakage currents have led to saturation in the power, operational frequency, and 
performance of CMOS processors as shown in Figure 1-1 [8]. While the performance 
limitations imposed by leakage currents have largely been mitigated by multi-core 
processors [9], direct drain-to-source tunneling is predicted to end microelectronic 
scaling [6, 7]. The ITRS 2013 roadmap predicts that transistor gate lengths will approach 
5 nm by 2030 [4]. Calculated tunneling current densities for such small devices indicate 

 2
that tunneling current will be 60 – 90 % of the transistor’s total current in both the on and 
off states [6] limiting their ability to act as switches. 
 
Figure 1-1: CMOS processor trends showing saturation in processor performance despite the 
increasing number of transistors. [8] 
 
With the impending end of Moore’s Law scaling, new approaches are being 
considered to improve computer performance [4]. The performance of general purpose 
computing can still be improved through non-scaling means including: high mobility 
channel materials, low interface trap density gate dielectrics, 3-D integration, power 
management, and heat removal [4]. However, emerging application specific technologies 
are also being developed to improve performance of specific tasks with 100 fold 
increases in processing speed [5]. These emerging technologies provide new and diverse 
computing paradigms such as GPU computing [10], quantum computing [11], optical 

 3
computing [12], or neuromorphic computing [13] that may be applied alone or in 
conjunction with general purpose CMOS processors. 
 
1.2 Neuromorphic Computing 
 
Neuromorphic computing uses microelectronic circuitry to mimic the biological 
computation performed in the human brain [13]. While CMOS computers excel at tasks 
such as basic arithmetic, the human brain performs poorly at these tasks. In contrast, 
CMOS computers must use computationally expensive algorithms for tasks such as 
pattern recognition, system control, and processing noisy data. The human brain excels at 
these tasks enabling us to recognize objects even at a variety of angles, walk as an 
unstable inverted pendulum, correlate sights, sounds, and smells, and pick out a person 
from a crowded room by any of these senses. Additionally, the human brain performs all 
of these tasks with a power consumption of about 20 watts [14].  
While digital and biological computation speeds cannot be directly compared due 
to their different computation paradigms, a rough comparison can be made by analyzing 
the scale of each technology. The Intel microprocessor (Broadwell-U), released in 2015, 
has a reported computational speed of about 8x1011 operations per second in a 28W chip 
using on-board GPU computing [15]. In comparison, the human brain contains 1012 
neurons each containing 104 synapses performing complex operations at speeds between 
0.1 – 100 Hz [14]. This yields computational speeds between 1015 – 1018 operations per 
second, 3 – 6 orders of magnitude faster than a modern processor with similar power 
consumption. Thus, if neuromorphic computation can emulate the biological brain it will 

 4
provide a computational paradigm that compliments the strengths and weaknesses of a 
CMOS computer while consuming less power and accelerating the computational speed. 
1.2.1 Introduction to Neurobiology 
In order to replicate the benefits of biological computation, it is necessary to 
understand at least the basics of its operation. The brain operates by the generation, 
propagation, scaling, and integration of voltage spikes termed action potentials [16]. Each 
of these operations is an analog process with variations in the spike rate, spike amplitude, 
and spike shape. There are multiple theories for how information is encoded in these 
variables and experimental evidence that multiple methods may be simultaneously 
applied in the brain [17]. Likewise, memory is also an active area of neurobiology 
research and may be stored in multiple ways. However, unlike Von Neumann computing, 
at least one form of memory in the brain is stored within the synaptic connections that 
also process data [16]. 
An individual neuron is the basic complete computational unit for processing 
action potentials. However, a neuron can be divided into physical structures that perform 
different computational tasks. These structures include: the synapses, the dendritic tree, 
the soma (cell body), the axon hillock, and the axon as shown in Figure 1-2. Each of 
these biological structures can be compared to a corresponding electronic analogue. This 
thesis examines the fabrication, function, and properties of several materials and devices 
that mimic these biological structures.

Figure 1-2: Schematic of a neuron with diagrams of synaptic function and action potential 
generation. A neuron consists of multiple structures that each performs a unique computational task 
as shown on the functional diagram to the right. Any particular neuron may have all or some of these 
structures. The diagram of synaptic function (Top Left) describes a typical chemically gated synapse. 
The diagram of action potential generation (Bottom Left) depicts the voltage gated ion channels in a 
neuron during an action potential. When the Na+ channels are open but the K+ channels are still 
closed the voltage increases (Left of sub-diagram). When the Na+ channels close and the K+ channels 
open, the voltage recovers (Right of sub-diagram) [16]. 
 
A typical neuron has between 103 – 104 synapses that connect it to other neurons 
[14]. As shown in Figure 1-2, when an action potential arrives at the synapse from the 
pre-synaptic neuron, the synapse allows an ionic current to flow into the post-synaptic 
neuron from the intracellular fluid. The magnitude of this current is determined by the 
synaptic conductance, which is at least one form of memory within the neuron [16]. Thus 
the synapse acts as a chemically gated transistor with memory. Synapses are often 
implemented in neuromorphic circuitry as digital connections or as transistor circuits that 
store the synaptic conductance as voltages on capacitors or floating gates [18]. These 
implementations suffer from analog/digital conversion, voltage decay, and high device 

 6
mismatch [18].  More recently, synapses have been implemented using two-terminal 
memristive devices [19]. These devices naturally implement long-term memory, but do 
not possess gain as observed in biological synapses [20]. Application of lithium niobite 
memristors for short-term memory has previously been examined [21] and application for 
long term memory will be examined in Chapter 2. 
The dendritic tree transports the synaptic ion current toward the soma (cell body). 
In its simplest form, the dendritic tree is a transmission line and can be described by 
passive cable equations with ionic resistors and capacitors. However, the structure of the 
dendritic tree strongly impacts this function controlling the distance and direction of 
current propagation. In addition, research indicates that some dendritic trees also provide 
active amplification and filtering as well as controlling communication between synapses 
[22]. The biological ion channels that enable amplification have previously been 
implemented in neuromorphic circuitry using electroformed Mott memristors [23]. 
Chapter 7 will discuss a new “memdiode” that is simpler to fabricate and exhibits similar 
capacitance, rectification, and hysteresis. These properties may be useful for both signal 
propagation and amplification. While not explicitly addressed in this thesis, Appendix B 
provides a brief discussion, in the context of future work, of how the dendritic tree 
structure affects spike propagation and synaptic learning. 
The soma or cell body primarily serves the non-computational functions of the 
neuron, such as storing genetic material, which need not be replicated in a neuromorphic 
circuit. However, the cell membrane surrounding the soma does provide charge storage 
that integrates the input current from the dendritic tree. The voltage across this 
membrane, which is typically 5 nm thick [14], is given by Equation 1.1 [16].

Equation 1.1 
Where R is the universal gas constant, T is temperature, F is Faraday’s constant, px is the 
relative permittivity of ion species X and [X+]o(i) is the concentration of ion species X 
outside (o) or inside (i) the cell. The soma can thus be considered as a capacitor or battery 
storing charge to form a voltage. Application of a lithium niobite battery as an ionic 
integrator similar to the cell membrane will be discussed in Chapter 6. 
The axon hillock resides at one side of the soma and is responsible for initiating 
action potentials [16]. When the cell potential exceeds a threshold value, positive 
feedback opens large numbers of voltage gated sodium channels causing the cell voltage 
to increase further. After a short delay, the voltage gated sodium channels close and 
voltage gated potassium channels open causing the cell voltage to decrease. Eventually 
the voltage gated potassium channels close and the neuron returns to its resting voltage 
[16]. The threshold voltage and timing of this process are functions of the neuron’s recent 
history acting as another form of memory [24]. The axon hillock is thus a threshold 
detector with short-term memory. While the axon hillock is not explicitly addressed in 
this PhD thesis, the ion dynamics are similar to those in the dendritic tree and axon. 
Therefore, the memdiode discussed in Chapter 7 may be applicable. 
The axon forms the final component of a neuron and is responsible for 
propagating the action potential to other neurons. Propagation occurs by passive 
conduction between active nodes that amplify the action potential using voltage gated ion 
channels similar to the axon hillock described above and shown in Figure 1-2. The axon 
can be described mathematically by the Hodgkin-Huxley model shown in Figure 1-3 
[25]. Later work demonstrated that the dynamic conductances described in the Hodgkin-

 8
Huxley model could be implemented by memristive systems [26]. A recent circuit using 
Mott Memristors replicated the functionality of an axon [23]. As previously noted, a new 
memdiode will be discussed in Chapter 7 that is simpler to fabricate and may be useful 
for both the signal propagation and amplification functions of an axon. It should be noted 
that since the original publication of the Hodgkin-Huxley model new discoveries have 
added complexity to the model of an axon. These additions are discussed in Appendix B.

While the basic neuron structures all serve specific functions, it is incorrect to 
assume that a complete neural processor can be built from a single neuron combining 
these structures. As described in an annual review of neuroscience: “Out of the 1012 
neurons in the human nervous system, there are ~10,000 distinct morphological classes” 
[22]. Each of these neuron classes serves a specific function enabled by its morphological 
properties. A review of these morphological effects is discussed in Appendix B. 
1.2.2 Previous Work in Neuromorphic Computing 

 9
The term ‘Neuromorphic’ was first introduced to academic literature by Carver 
Mead in 1990 to describe “systems based on the organizing principles used by the 
nervous system” [13]. While this description is quite broad, later definitions draw fine 
lines between neuromorphic, bio-inspired, and biomimetic systems [27]. For the purpose 
of this work, we will ignore any such distinctions as the circuit complexity and level of 
biological mimicry develops through the history of neuromorphic research. 
Early work mimicking biological functionality using analog VLSI technology 
focused on sensory perception, specifically vision [28, 29] and hearing [30, 31]. These 
systems successfully replicated many important functionalities of sensory perception by 
analyzing the associated biological structures and capturing the gross behavior of each 
structure in an analog circuit. For example, by analyzing the retina, Mahowald and Mead 
[28] produced a circuit mimicking the retinal photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and bipolar 
cells [28]. Mimicking these cells reproduced functionality including the logarithmic light 
sensitivity of a photoreceptor that provides us with sensitivity to many orders of 
magnitude of light intensity and the local spatial and temporal weighting of the horizontal 
cell layer that allows us to see high contrast images [28]. Likewise, early audio sensory 
perception focused on reproducing the spatial filtering of frequencies within the cochlea 
while maintaining enough temporal resolution to recognize patterns such as speech or 
musical rhythm [30]. However, these early efforts largely ignored the mechanisms behind 
the biological functions and the manner in which biology encodes information, namely in 
action potentials. 
Despite the cellular level of functional detail these early systems reproduced, they 
emphasized the importance of subcellular adaptation mechanisms. For example, in 

 10
biological retinal neurons, differences in photoreceptor sensitivity and synaptic strength 
are compensated by feedback adaptation mechanisms that are still an active area of 
research [32, 33]. Likewise, early retinal circuits suffered from fabrication variations and 
sensitivity to transistor offset voltages [13]. Adaptation was accomplished by a UV 
stimulated shunt conductance on a floating gate transistor [13]. While this is clearly not 
the adaptation mechanism used in biological neurons, the circuit designers noted: “Once 
we understand the principles of adaptation, we can incorporate them into our silicon 
retina” [13]. This co-development of neuromorphic systems alongside active research on 
neurobiological systems leads to mixtures of bio-mimicry with functional VLSI design.  
The introduction of action potentials to neuromorphic circuits was first reported in 
1991 as the level of bio-mimicry increased from the cellular level to the sub-cellular level 
[34]. The kinetics of sodium and potassium ion channels responsible for action potential 
generation were reproduced using differential pair CMOS transistor circuits [34]. While 
this circuit successfully demonstrated action potentials similar to a pyramidal neuron, the 
primary neuron in the neocortex, this function only covers the soma and axon hillock 
functionalities of a biological neuron. 
This early neuron circuit operated at biological frequencies [34] (0.1 – 100 Hz) 
[14]. While an electronic artificial neuron could certainly operate orders of magnitude 
faster than the ionic biological neuron, it is important to match the neural circuit’s speed 
to the system it senses or controls. Finally, the early artificial neuron consumed only 60 
µW of power [34]. While this is 4 orders of magnitude less power than an operational 
amplifier built with the same technology, it is still at least 6 orders of magnitude more 
power than a biological neuron [34]. Future work reduced this power consumption to 300 

 11
nW in 2003 [35] and 7.5 nW in 2009 [36], still more power consumption than the 20 pW 
for a biological neuron. 
The early neuromorphic systems laid the foundations for the emerging field of 
neuromorphic computing, but left many research avenues open including: power 
efficiency [19, 35-39], information coding [18, 38, 40, 41], memory mechanisms [19, 40, 
42, 43], volatile adaptation [38, 44], circuit density [19, 37], and neural connections [18, 
19, 45]. The guideline for approaching all of these topics was laid out by Carver Mead 
when he defined the field: “the real trick is to invent a representation that takes advantage 
of the inherent capabilities of the medium…using the nervous system as a guide, we will 
attempt to find a natural way to integrate them into an overall system-design strategy” 
[13]. 
 
1.3 Memristors 
 
Neuromorphic computing research predominately focused on silicon analog VLSI 
technology from the early 80’s through 2008 because that was the dominant medium 
available. However, in 2008 with the realization of physical memristive devices [46], a 
new medium with biologically relevant capabilities became available. 
Memristors, first theorized by Leon Chua in 1971 [47], are the fourth fundamental 
passive two terminal device complementing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. These 
passive circuit elements are described by relationships between voltage (V), current (I), 
charge (Q), and flux-linkage (ϕ) according to Equations 1.2a-f.

The absence of this last equation was conspicuous at the time and Chua argued 
that it should exist based on completeness [47]. Theoretical analysis of the memristor 
equation revealed that such a device should act like a variable resistor with memory of its 
input. Thus the name memristor (memory – resistor) was chosen [47]. 
In 1976, Chua introduced a broader class of devices termed memristive systems 
[26]. These systems include the original memristor definition, but can describe additional 
effects such as multiple input forces, multiple output variables, and multiple internal 
mechanisms capable of modifying the memristance (M) [26]. This broader definition has 
been important for describing and modeling physical memristors because the more 
restrictive 1971 definition does not allow for effects such as threshold voltages [46, 48-
51], volatile relaxation [52], thermal [23], optical [53], or magnetic inputs [54-56], or 
multi-port devices [57, 58]. All of these effects have been observed in physical devices 
and no known device fits the more restrictive 1971 definition. Similar to the debate 
between neuromorphic vs. biomimetic systems, there has been considerable debate as to 
what constitutes a “true” memristor [59, 60]. We will once again ignore this distinction 
and accept any device matching the 1976 definition as a memristor. 
While resistive switching memories have been researched since at least the early 
1960’s [61], in 2008 HP Labs first linked resistive switching memories to the memristor 
formalism [46]. Since that announcement, memristive behavior has been discovered in a 

 13
wide range of devices. These devices can broadly be divided into categories based on 
their internal memristance mechanism. Such categories include: filamentary memristors 
[46, 48-51, 62], mobile ion wavefront memristors [21, 63, 64], oxidation/reduction 
memristors [57, 58], spintronic memristors [54-56], ferroelectric memristors [65], and 
Mott metal-insulator switches [23]. A discussion of these memristor classes is provided 
in Appendix C. The majority of memristor research has focused on memristors based on 
ion motion including the filamentary and mobile ion wavefront memristors. 
Both filamentary and mobile ion wavefront memristors operate due to the 
movement of mobile atoms that modify the local electronic conductivity. In filamentary 
memristors, localized breakdown of a thin insulating material causes the movement and 
removal of atoms forming a thin filament connecting two metal electrodes [66]. This 
electroforming process often removes atoms violently from the film causing damage to 
the contacts [66, 67]. Once electroformed, filamentary memristors are switched by 
electrically driving atoms to create or destroy a high conductance region along the 
filament [46, 67]. This switching process requires electric fields above 106 V/cm [68], 
produces power densities on the order of 1012 W/cm3 [62], and reaches temperatures of 
800 K [69]. While filamentary memristors are most commonly used as digital devices 
[70], within neuromorphic computing filamentary memristors have primarily been used 
to replicate biological synapses [19, 71]. By carefully controlling the magnitude and 
timing of the applied voltage/current, filamentary memristors can be made to have analog 
resistance values [72]. However, one estimate stated that a neuromorphic chip with 106 
neurons/cm2 each connected with 104 synapses made from state-of-the-art filamentary 

 14
memristors operating at biological frequencies (10 Hz) would have to dissipate 2 kW of 
power [19], which is 2 orders of magnitude more power than the entire brain uses. 
In contrast to filamentary memristors, mobile ion wavefront memristors do not 
form a localized filament and do not require electroforming. One example of this type of 
memristor is the co-sputtered Ag/Si memristor [63]. The ion profile for this memristor is 
created during the sputter deposition process as silver dopant atoms are introduced part of 
the way through the deposition [63]. Mobile ion wavefront memristors have an analog 
resistance range making them useful for analog neuromorphic computing, but do not 
have as wide a dynamic range (RON / ROFF) as filamentary memristors. 
The memristors analyzed herein are mobile ion wavefront memristors made from 
lithium niobite (LiNbO2). This material displays memristive behavior due to the motion 
of highly mobile lithium ions that act as dopants [21, 73, 74]. One rather unique aspect of 
lithium niobite compared to other memristive materials is the volatile nature of its 
memristive behavior due to the low activation energy for lithium motion [75, 76]. 
 
1.4 Lithium Niobite (LiNbO2) 
 
Lithium niobite (LiNbO2) is a minimally studied sub-oxide of the common optical 
[77, 78] and acoustic [78] wave guiding material lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Lithium 
niobite is structurally related to several lithium ion battery cathode materials including 
LiCoO2. These materials possess a layered structure in which planes of lithium ions 
separate sheets of metal oxide as shown in Figure 1-4. 

 15
 
Figure 1-4: Ball and stick structural model of lithium niobite (LiNbO2). Planes of loosely bound 
lithium sit between sheets of niobium oxide. 
 
The primary structural difference between lithium niobite and other battery 
cathode materials is a 180o twist in the crystal structure. This results in the niobium atoms 
occupying trigonal-prismatic sites in LiNbO2 (space group P63/mmc) [79] rather than 
octahedral sites in LiCoO2 (space group R ̅m) [80]. The consequence of this structural 
change is a three band electronic structure, shown in Figure 1-5, with significant metal-
metal bonding and high electronic conductivity [81, 82]. The tunable electrical and 
optical properties that make lithium niobite useful for neuromorphic computing result 
from changes to this band structure as lithium is moved within the crystal or removed 
(delithiation) from the crystal. 
1.4.1 Theoretical Band Structure 
The three band structure in lithium niobite occurs due to crystal field splitting in 
the trigonal-prismatic coordination [82, 83] resulting in a completely filled lower valence 
band, a completely filled upper valence band, and an empty conduction band. Partial 
density of states calculations indicate that these bands are composed almost exclusively 

 16
of niobium and oxygen orbitals while lithium has a localized orbital [81, 82, 84]. The 
lithium atoms are almost completely ionized [76, 82, 84] donating an electron to fill the 
upper valence band. As lithium atoms are removed from lithium niobite, forming 
LixNbO2 with x < 1, electrons are removed from the upper valence band forming a 
degenerately doped p-type material [82]. Removal of all of the lithium would 
theoretically result in a half filled upper valence band [85], although such extreme 
delithiation has never been demonstrated. 
 
Figure 1-5: Theoretical three band structure for lithium niobite as calculated by Ylvisaker et al. [82] 
The bottom band is full occupied and is not electrically or optically active. The middle band (valence 
band) is the primary electronic band as LixNbO2 (x < 1) is degenerately doped p-type. The top band 
(conduction band) is empty. 
 
1.4.2 Functional Properties 
Memristive behavior occurs in lithium niobite [21, 74] due to lithium ion motion 
modifying the local occupancy of states [73, 86]. While models of lithium niobite 
memristors produce orders of magnitude changes in memristance [87], only smaller 
percentage changes have been experimentally observed [21]. This discrepancy is perhaps 

 17
because the most dramatic changes in memristance occur when the lithium concentration 
is near the ideal stoichiometry [87], a condition that is difficult to experimentally achieve 
[88] as shown in Figure 1-6. The lithium ions in lithium niobite are loosely bound to the 
crystal and can be removed chemically forming LixNbO2 with lower memristive potential 
[88]. For example, deionized water used for cleaning a sample surface can remove up to 
11% of the lithium from lithium niobite [88]. A list of reported chemical delithation 
values is given in Table 1 [88]. While the ease of lithium removal is a fabrication 
challenge for lithium niobite based devices, the motion of lithium ions necessary for 
memristive behavior is also enabled by the loose lithium binding and a low (~300 meV) 
activation energy barrier for motion [75, 76]. This low activation energy also enables 
room temperature diffusion and volatile behavior [75, 76].

stoichiometric concentration, although experimentally this is difficult to achieve due to the ease of 
chemical lithium removal. 
 
Early work on lithium niobite primarily focused on fundamental material 
properties [75, 76, 79, 82, 84, 86, 88-92] and applications as a superconductor [75, 85, 
88, 93] and battery cathode [90, 94]. Through this early research it was discovered that 
most physical and electrical properties of lithium niobite are dependent on the lithium 
content including: the crystalline lattice parameters [90], the superconductivity transition 
temperature [85], the battery open-circuit voltage [90, 94], and the resistivity [90].

CHAPTER 2 
SPUTTER DEPOSITION OF LITHIUM NIOBITE 
 
2.1 History of Lithium Niobite Fabrication 
 
Synthesis of lithium niobite has previously been demonstrated by reaction of 
powdered precursors [79, 85, 90], liquid phase electrolysis [88, 92, 95], and by molecular 
beam epitaxy [21, 64]. Early work with reacted powders likely contained unreacted 
precursors [79] or other impurities [82] leading to experimental discrepancies such as 
both metallic [88] and semiconducting [90] temperature dependent resistivity and varying 
magnetic properties including diamagnetic [75], paramagnetic [85, 90], and 
antiferromagnetic [79] behavior. The reactions [91] necessary to form powdered lithium 
niobite occur at temperatures between 700 – 900 oC [79] and do not produce material 
suitable for microelectronics. 
Synthesis of lithium niobite by liquid phase electrolysis produces bulk crystals 
with millimeter to centimeter dimensions [88, 92, 95]. This process involves 
electrodeposition from a molten lithium borate solution at temperatures between 800 – 
900 oC [92, 95]. This method produces high quality single crystals [95] useful for 
exploring the material properties of lithium niobite, but the molten lithium borate solution 
readily dissolves oxides and is incompatible with many other microelectronic materials 
[96]. 
The final method for synthesis of lithium niobite is by metal-halide molecular 
beam epitaxy (MBE) [21, 64]. This method substitutes evaporation of niobium by 
electron beam evaporation, which is incompatible with an oxygen environment, with a 

 20
NbCl5 source [64]. The NbCl5 is chemically cracked on the wafer surface by excess 
lithium forming metallic niobium and the high vapor pressure material LiCl, which 
desorbs. Lithium niobite is formed by a careful balance of lithium flux, NbCl5 flux, and 
oxygen flux from a remote plasma source [64]. This halide-MBE process is also capable 
of producing Nb, NbO, LiNbO3, and Li3NbO4 [64]. However, while the MBE method for 
lithium niobite synthesis produces high quality thin films suitable for microelectronics, 
the 950 oC environment, excess lithium flux, and chlorine environment may produce 
technical constraints for incorporation with other microelectronic materials. 
 
2.2 Building a Sputtering System 
 
Previous methods of lithium niobite synthesis have supplied the refractory metal 
niobium through high temperatures and reactive chemistries because metallic niobium is 
difficult to evaporate (vapor pressure = 4.86 x 10-22 Torr at 900oC) [64] and difficult to 
dissolve [97]. In contrast, sputter deposition can easily provide a flux of niobium atoms 
because sputtering operates on the transfer of kinetic energy [98] rather than equilibrium 
vapor pressure (as in evaporation) or chemical solvency (as in electrodeposition). 
In order to explore sputter deposition of lithium niobite, a research-grade 
sputtering system was needed that could achieve: high substrate temperatures, co-
deposition from multiple targets, multiple gas flows for reactive sputtering, and an 
electrically isolated platen for in situ plasma cleaning in order to explore the effects of all 
of these variables on the synthesis of lithium niobite. The sputtering system constructed 

 21
for this purpose is the Denton Discovery 2 sputtering system located in the IEN Marcus 
inorganic cleanroom as shown in Figure 2-1. 
 
Figure 2-1: The Denton Discovery 2 sputtering system located in the Marcus Inorganic Cleanroom. 
 
2.2.1 Initial System Setup 
 
In collaboration with the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology (IEN) staff, 
a used Denton Discovery 18 sputtering system was purchased and modified to meet the 
requirements of this research. In order to make the system operational, a vacuum 
pumping system had to be built, the control system had to be replaced, and heat reflectors 
had to be added for high temperature operation.  
 
The Denton Discovery 2 originally had only 2 confocal sputtering cathodes. 
These cathodes have directly cooled targets that are 3.625 inches in diameter. The 
directly cooled targets are metal bonded directly to the copper cooling block that has 
chilled water flowing through it. The combination of efficient heat transfer in the directly 
cooled design along with the large area targets allows these cathodes to operate at high 

 22
power. However, replacing the directly cooled targets requires disassembling the entire 
cathode, which takes multiple hours to complete. The cathode disassembly procedure can 
be found in Appendix A. A third cathode was added to the system in order to provide a 
cathode with easily exchangeable targets. It is a 3 inch diameter indirectly cooled cathode 
with a magnetron magnet configured to handle magnetic target materials. The indirectly 
cooled design clamps the target onto the cooling block making the target less efficiently 
cooled, but changing targets can be done in minutes rather than hours. The magnet 
configured for magnetic materials is stronger than a typical magnetron magnet and allows 
the system to deposit nickel as a lithium blocking electrode [99] and to explore the 
deposition of lithium cobalt oxide which is structurally similar to lithium niobite, but is 
more resistive (0.52 – 3.4 TΩ-cm) [100] and exhibits variable magnetism [101]. 
2.2.2 Vacuum Systems 
 
The Denton Discovery 2 did not have a vacuum pumping system when purchased. 
A 6 inch diameter BOC Edwards EXT250M turbomolecular pump (nominal 240 L/s N2) 
backed by a QDP40 oil-free rough pump was added to the system. The rough pump also 
has a direct connection to the main process chamber in order to pump down the system 
from atmospheric pressure. Due to the system geometry, the turbo pump has a poor 
conduction path to the main process chamber limiting the pump-down speed. A pump-
purge procedure was attempted to accelerate the pump down process. This procedure 
utilized the direct rough pump to chamber connection to pump down the chamber to 10 
Torr and then the dry nitrogen purge line to purge the chamber to 300 Torr. It was 
expected that this procedure would remove adsorbed water vapor and CO2 accelerating 
the pump down time to high vacuum. As shown in Figure 2-2, while the pump-purge 

 23
procedure did slightly accelerate the pump down time once the procedure was complete, 
the added time to complete the pump-purge procedure eliminated any advantage and 
slowed down the total pump down time. 
 
Figure 2-2: Comparison of the normal pump-down procedure and the pump-purge procedure. 
(Right) Once the pump-purge process was completed the chamber pumped down faster than the 
normal pump down process for the same pressure range. (Left) However, including the time 
required to complete the pump-purge cycles, the pump-purge procedure was slower than the normal 
pump down procedure. 
 
 
Because the pump-purge procedure was unable to accelerate the pump down time, 
a cryo pump was added directly to the side of the main process chamber. The 
combination of a faster pumping speed (nominal 1500 L/s air, 4000L/s water vapor) and 
a direct connection conduction path reduced the pump down time from multiple hours to 
approximately 20 minutes. While adding the cryo pump accelerated the pump down time, 
it cannot be used to control pressure during a deposition and must be carefully monitored 
during high temperature processes as will be discussed in Section 2.2.6. 
 
During a sputter deposition process, the pressure is controlled by fixing a set mass 
flow of process gas (Ar, O2, or N2) and then controlling the pumping speed using a 
throttle valve in front of the turbo pump. This procedure produces more reproducible 
films than a mass flow controlled system particularly during reactive sputtering [102]. 

 24
Details about the relationship between mass flow, chamber pressure, and throttle valve 
position can be found in Appendix A. 
2.2.3 Deposition Uniformity 
 
The Denton Discovery 2 has a 6 inch diameter platen located at the confocal point 
of the three sputtering targets. In order to test the deposition uniformity over this area, a 
deposition was performed from the smallest (3 inch diameter) target onto a 6 inch 
diameter wafer with a grid of shadowed regions. The deposition thickness was measured 
by stylus profilometer after the deposition was complete and found to have a mean 
thickness of 592.2 nm with a standard deviation of 10.7 nm across the wafer. The 
thickness uniformity is thus better than a 2% error of the total thickness. No pattern was 
found in the film thickness across the wafer. Uniform deposition over a 6 inch diameter 
wafer is a significant improvement over previous lithium niobite deposition systems 
(MBE and electrodeposition) which have both been limited to approximately 1 cm2 
samples. 
2.2.4 Reactive Deposition 
 
In order to sputter deposit ceramic films, it is often desirable to introduce reactive 
gas species into the sputtering plasma. For example, the deposition of Nb2O5 can be 
accomplished by sputtering a metallic niobium target in an oxygen environment. While 
this procedure allows for fast deposition, controllable film properties, and cheaper 
equipment (DC vs RF power source and metallic vs pressed ceramic targets), the physics 
of reactive sputter deposition are nontrivial [103] and must be characterized on each 
sputtering system. 

 25
 
Figure 2-3 shows typical reactivity curves for the effect of oxygen on a niobium 
target in the Denton Discovery 2. As the oxygen flow is increased the niobium target 
voltage is initially stable until a threshold is reach. Above this threshold, the target 
voltage increases rapidly until re-stabilizing at a new value. When decreasing the oxygen 
flow, the threshold from high voltage to low voltage occurs at a lower oxygen flow than 
the initial threshold producing hysteresis. These transitions occur due to the competition 
of oxygen reacting with the target surface changing the target impedance and the 
sputtering process removing the reacted layer. At low oxygen flows, the reacted material 
can be removed faster than it accumulates leaving the target surface clean. At high 
oxygen flows, the reacted oxide accumulates on the target changing the surface 
composition. The target voltages and operational regimes are functions of both target 
power and operating pressure as shown in Figure 2-3. 
 
Figure 2-3: Reactivity curves for a niobium target exposed to an oxygen plasma in the Denton 
Discovery 2. The voltage levels, threshold flows, and target hysteresis are functions of both target 
power and chamber pressure. 
 
2.2.5 Co-deposition from Multiple Targets 

 26
 
When depositing metal alloys or ceramics with more than two elements, such as 
lithium niobite (LiNbO2), it is often advantageous to separate the atomic constituents into 
multiple targets and co-deposit [102]. The Denton Discovery 2 was built such that each 
target has its own power source that can be individually controlled in the control 
software. An example of co-deposition is shown in Figure 2-4 in which both a lithium 
oxide target (left) and niobium target (right) are simultaneously energized to produce 
lithium niobite. 
 
Figure 2-4: Sputtering plasmas from co-depositing lithium niobite from a lithium oxide (Li2O) target 
(left) and a niobium target (right). The difference in plasma color is due to oxygen from the lithium 
oxide target becoming ionized and emitting a pink glow. 
 
 
In addition to co-depositing from multiple targets, the Denton Discovery 2 can 
also energize the wafer platen in order to clean a wafer before deposition or etch back the 
film during deposition. Exposing films to ion bombardment during growth has been 
shown to change film morphology, density, and stress [104]. Because there is no 
magnetic confinement on the platen, a plasma lit on the platen exists both above the 

 27
platen affecting the wafers as well as below the platen as shown in Figure 2-5. Due to this 
unconfined plasma, special precautions must be taken when using the platen plasma 
during high temperature depositions as discussed in Appendix A. 
 
 
 
Figure 2-5: A plasma lit on the platen during a deposition. This plasma bombards the wafer surface 
with ions changing many properties of the depositing film. 
 
2.2.6 High Substrate Temperatures 
Growth of high quality crystalline films usually requires elevated substrate 
temperatures. For example lithium niobate (LiNbO3) can be grown by molecular beam 
epitaxy [105, 106] or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition [107], but only at 
temperatures between 700 – 950 oC. The Denton Discovery 2 had to be heavily modified 
in order to reach these temperatures. 7200 W of quartz infra-red tube heaters were added 
behind the platen. Polished heat reflectors were added under the platen in order to hold 
the infra-red lamps and direct their radiation onto the back-side of the platen. The heaters 

 28
were then enclosed in a four layer heat shield in order to contain the heat within a small 
area behind the platen. Without this heat shield the o-rings on the chamber exceeded 200 
oC and began to melt. Finally, active cooling had to be added to the chamber wall in order 
to remove heat that leaked out from between the heat shield and the platen. Another heat 
shield enclosing the sides of the platen was added to help contain the heat behind the 
platen. As shown in Figure 2-6, after these modifications the platen could be heated to a 
glow. The maximum measured platen temperature is above 850 oC, although this was 
measured with only 4800 W of heater installed. 
 
Figure 2-6: The platen glowing during a high temperature process.  
 
Due to the incomplete containment of infra-red radiation during a high 
temperature process, it is often necessary to close off the cryo pump during these 
processes. Enough radiation escapes to heat the cryo pump arrays releasing trapped gases. 
For platen temperatures above 600 oC, the cryo pump begins to increase the system 
pressure if left open.

2.3 Sputter Deposition of Lithium Niobite 
 
Sputter deposition of lithium niobite has never previously been reported. 
Therefore, initial attempts at sputter deposition of lithium niobite followed the methods 
used for the related compounds LiNbO3 [108-110] and LiCoO2 [111-113] by depositing 
at high substrate temperatures from a single pressed powder sputtering target with mean 
composition Li – Nb – 2O. This method initially produced weakly crystalline c-oriented 
lithium niobite as shown in Figure 2-7. 
 
Figure 2-7: X-ray diffractogram of a film RF sputter deposited from a single pressed powder target 
with mean composition Li-Nb-2O. The film was deposited at 100W power, 10 mTorr argon pressure, 
and 800 oC substrate temperature. Weak x-ray diffraction peaks are visible for the (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) 
orientations. Peaks labeled with a * are from the sapphire substrate. The peak at 37.6o is from the 
XRD stage. 
 
 
While depositing lithium niobite, it is desirable to avoid high substrate 
temperatures in order to limit lithium diffusion into other microelectronic materials. 
Lowering the substrate temperature from 800oC to 500oC also produced lithium niobite, 

 30
as shown in Figure 2-8, but in the (1 0 1) orientation rather than the c-orientation 
observed at the higher substrate temperature. 
 
Figure 2-8: X-ray diffractogram (left) of a film RF sputter deposited from a single Li-Nb-2O target at 
a substrate temperature of 500oC. The resulting material is (1 0 1) oriented lithium niobite with an 
XRD peak located at 36.6o. The symmetric rocking curve width (right) is 163 arcsec indicating highly 
oriented material with little tilt. Peaks labeled with a * are from the sapphire substrate. The peak at 
37.6o is from the XRD stage. 
 
Identifying (1 0 1) oriented lithium niobite by XRD alone is difficult due to the 
close proximity of peaks from other Li-Nb-O compounds and the wide range of lithium 
niobite XRD peak locations due to changes in lithium content. It was previously shown 
that changing the lithium content of LixNbO2 (0.5 < x < 1) also changes the lattice 
spacing of the lithium niobite crystal [90]. Calculating the spacing between (1 0 1) planes 
in lithium niobite for the previously reported range of a-spacing (2.900 – 2.925 Å) and c-
spacing (10.46 – 10.465 Å) lattice parameters yields XRD 2θ-ω peak locations between 
36.476o – 36.773o neglecting any additional shifts due to film strain. In addition, many 
other Li-Nb-O compounds have XRD 2θ-ω peaks near this range of angles including: 
NbFCC (1 1 1) at 36.77o, NbO (1 1 1) at 36.95o, LiNb3O8 (6 0 0) at 36.99o, and Li3NbO4 (2 
2 2) at 36.99o. In order to confirm the deposited material was (1 0 1) oriented lithium 

 31
niobite, rather than a strained film with different composition, an asymmetric XRD peak 
was found for the (1 0 0) planes of lithium niobite as shown in Figure 2-9. 
 
Figure 2-9: Asymmetric (1 0 0) rocking curve of the (1 0 1) oriented lithium niobite film deposited 
from a single Li-Nb-2O target at a substrate temperature of 500oC. The existence of this peak 
confirms the film as lithium niobite rather than an alternative Li-Nb-O phase. 
 
 
While initial results depositing lithium niobite from a single Li-Nb-2O target were 
promising, successive depositions were inconsistent with peaks from additional phases 
present in the x-ray diffractograms. Shown in Figure 2-10 is an x-ray diffractogram from 
a film deposited under identical conditions to the film from Figure 2-8. In addition to the 
(1 0 1) lithium niobite peak there is a (0 0 6) lithium niobate peak. This film was 
deposited immediately after cleaning the Li-Nb-2O target indicating that target aging was 
required to produce the previous lithium niobite films. Attempts to compensate for the 
target aging by adding reactive oxygen to the plasma or co-sputtering with a metallic 
niobium target were unsuccessful in producing a repeatable deposition condition. 
 
 

 32
 
Figure 2-10: X-ray diffractogram of a film RF sputter deposited from a single Li-Nb-2O target at a 
substrate temperature of 500oC. A peak from LiNbO3 is present in addition to the desired LiNbO2 
peak. Peaks labeled with a * are from the sapphire substrate. 
 
Aging of compound ceramic targets is a well-established phenomenon in which 
the history of the target usage affects the surface composition of the target and the 
resulting film depositions [113]. One major cause of target aging is preferential sputtering 
in which some elements are removed from the target surface faster than other elements. 
Preferential sputtering can be caused by either differences in surface binding energy or by 
differences in elemental mass [114]. It is therefore not surprising that a sputtering target 
containing lithium (mass: 6.94 amu), oxygen (mass: 15.99 amu), and niobium (mass: 
92.91 amu) suffers from preferential sputtering. 
In order to reduce the effects of preferential sputtering, depositions were 
performed by co-depositing from a lithium oxide (Li2O) target and a niobium target 
separating the light and heavy elements. As shown in Figure 2-11, crystalline (1 0 1) 
oriented lithium niobite was obtained for a niobium target power of 50 W and a lithium 

 33
oxide target power of 200 W or 300 W. These depositions were performed at room 
temperature with 10 mTorr of argon process gas. 
 
Figure 2-11: Grid of x-ray diffractograms produced by the initial search for sputter deposited 
lithium niobite by co-depositing from a lithium oxide and a niobium target. Crystalline lithium 
niobite was found for depositions at 50W of niobium power and 200W or 300W of lithium oxide 
power. 
 
 
It was found that by lowering the deposition pressure to 1 mTorr, the film 
crystallinity as measured by XRD peak intensity increased dramatically as shown in 
Figure 2-12. This deposition condition became the “standard” lithium niobite condition 
used for lithium niobite based devices.

deposited at room temperature with 1 mTorr process gas pressure. 
 
2.4 Characterization of Sputter Deposited Lithium Niobite 
 
The sputter deposited lithium niobite standard condition was analyzed in order to 
understand its structural, chemical, electrical, and optical properties. The initial structural 
feature that is apparent upon examining the XRD is a low angle shoulder in the lithium 
niobite peak. This feature is clearly visible in the (2 0 2) peak of Figure 2-12 or in the 
zoomed in (1 0 1) peak shown in Figure 2-13. 
 

 35
 
Figure 2-13: (1 0 1) x-ray diffractogram peak from the standard lithium niobite deposition condition 
showing a main peak and a low angle shoulder. 
 
 
Scanning around the (1 0 1) peak in reciprocal space yields Figure 2-14 where the 
2 theta – omega axis measures the spacing between crystalline planes and the omega 
offset axis measures the tilt in the crystalline planes away from the substrate (i.e. zero 
omega offset is aligned to the underlying sapphire substrate). XRD features can spread in 
2 theta – omega due to either gradients in strain or due to Scherrer broadening [115, 116] 
caused by small crystal sizes as described by Equation 2.1 where τ is the average particle 
size, K is a shape constant close to unity, λ is the x-ray wavelength, β is the line 
broadening in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle. 
  
  
    ( ) 
Equation 2.1 

 36
From Figure 2-14, two features are apparent. The main peak is a feature broad in 
omega offset yet fairly narrow in 2 theta – omega. The low angle shoulder is very narrow 
in omega offset and broad in 2 theta – omega. The breadth of the main peak in omega 
offset suggests a feature with a high spread of tilt away from the sapphire substrate. 
Likewise, the narrowness of the shoulder in omega offset indicates a feature well aligned 
to the sapphire substrate with little tilt. However, the breadth of the shoulder in 2 theta – 
omega suggests a feature with either a strain gradient or small dimensions. 
 
Figure 2-14: XRD reciprocal space map of the (1 0 1) lithium niobite peak showing two distinct 
features. The main peak is broad in omega offset while the low angle shoulder is broad in 2 theta – 
omega. 
 
 
Examining the cross sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shown 
in Figure 2-15, two structural features are also apparent. Close to the sapphire substrate 
are small particles that transition into small columnar grains further into the film. 
However, around 250 nm into the film tapered crystallites form and begin propagating 
taking up more of the film’s volume. While correlating cross sectional SEM features with 

 37
XRD features is difficult, the two features observed in the SEM qualitatively match the 
two features described by the XRD reciprocal space map.  
 
Figure 2-15: cross sectional SEM of the standard lithium niobite sputtering condition showing a two 
layer structure with small particles near the substrate and tapered crystallites nucleating 
approximately 250 nm into the film. 
 
 
The small particles that transition into small columnar grains may correspond to 
the low angle shoulder observed in the XRD. The columnar grains appear well aligned to 
the sapphire substrate with little tilt between grains. Applying the Scherrer Equation 
(Equation 2.1) to the low angle XRD shoulder predicts a particle size of 9.1 – 19.6 nm. 
The columnar grains seen in the cross sectional SEM are approximately 14.6 ± 2.0 nm 
across. 

 38
 
Likewise, the tapered crystallites observed in the cross sectional SEM may 
correspond to the main XRD peak. The tapered crystallites exhibit a wide degree of tilt 
away from the sapphire substrate, although it is impossible to determine how the 
crystalline planes are affected by this structural SEM feature. 
 
As expected from the cross sectional SEM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
reveals a rough surface with 14.8 nm rms roughness. As shown in Figure 2-16, the rough 
surface is caused by features that are approximately 200 nm across. The features 
observed in the AFM are the same size as the tapered crystallites observed in the cross 
sectional SEM. 
 
Figure 2-16: AFM surface showing a rough surface with approximately 200 nm diameter features 
protruding from the film. 
 

 39
 
Looking at the film surface, shown in Figure 2-17, with an optical microscope or 
large area AFM, a pattern of lines is observed. The cause of this self-organized pattern is 
unknown, although similar features have been observed when films are exposed to ions at 
an oblique angle [117, 118] such as may be the case in confocal sputtering. An alternative 
explanation for the self-organized pattern is directionally dependent adatom surface 
mobility promoting surface transport and nucleation along specific crystalline axis. 
However, the three-fold symmetry of the underlying sapphire substrate is not observed. 
 
Figure 2-17: (Left) optical microscope image and (Right) large area AFM image showing a stripe 
feature on the surface of the sputter deposited lithium niobite. 
 
 
In addition to structural characterization, the lithium niobite standard deposition 
condition was chemically analyzed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The 
XPS spectra for the standard deposition condition are shown in Figure 2-18 including 
spectra from both the film’s surface and after milling into the bulk of the film. The 
surface spectra can be fit using only the Nb3+ and Nb5+ oxidation states. The ratio of the 
areas of these two peaks weighted by the oxidation state yields a mean oxidation state of 
4.25. In contrast, the existence of a surface oxide and preferential sputtering during the 
XPS depth profile causes a lower mean oxidation state of 2.92 after milling into the film. 

 40
Preferential sputtering during the depth profile removes more oxygen than niobium and 
causes a mixture of many oxidation states [119]. While this ambiguity in absolute 
oxidation state determination prevents quantization of the exact oxidation state, 
comparisons from one sample to another allow relative changes in oxidation state to be 
determined. 
 
Figure 2-18: XPS niobium spectra of the sputter deposited lithium niobite on the (Left) surface and 
(Right) after ion milling into the bulk of the film. These plots indicate that the surface contains a fully 
oxidized Nb5+ state while the film bulk is close to the ideal Nb3+ state. 
 
In order to compare the sputter deposited film to a known lithium niobite 
standard, XPS of bulk lithium niobite, grown by liquid phase electro-epitaxy [95], was 
performed. As shown in Figure 2-19, the niobium XPS spectrum for the sputter deposited 
film is nearly identical to the XPS spectrum for the bulk grown material indicating that 
the sputtered material has a chemical environment around the niobium atoms that is 
similar to the previously characterized [95] bulk grown material. 

 41
 
Figure 2-19: XPS niobium spectra for sputter deposited and bulk grown lithium niobite showing 
nearly identical spectra indicating similar chemical bonding around the niobium in these two 
materials. 
 
 
The electrical [90] and optical [53] properties of lithium niobite are known to 
depend on the amount of lithium in the material. However, it may be noted that no linear 
combination of Li2O and Nb can form LiNbO2. In order to obtain the ideal 2:1 oxygen to 
niobium ratio, excess lithium must a) not incorporate into the deposited film or b) evolve 
out of the film after it has been deposited. The sputter deposited lithium niobite reacts 
with air upon removal from the sputtering chamber to form an insulating film on top of 
the deposited film, as shown in Figure 2-20. The surface layer that forms is water soluble 
and upon dissolution from a 2 inch diameter wafer turns 100 mL of deionized water basic 
with a pH of 10 – 11, likely due to the formation of LiOH. 

 42
 
Figure 2-20: Images of sputter deposited lithium niobite (Left) before and (Right) after treatment 
with deionized water. The films as deposited react with the air forming an insulating surface film 
that is water soluble. 
 
Examining the XPS spectra for lithium, niobium, and oxygen, shown in Figure 
2-21, the reacted surface layer is composed of lithium and oxygen with no niobium 
present. After milling into the deposited film, niobium and oxygen are both present. 
Lithium may also be present after milling, but the lithium 1s spectrum overlaps the 
niobium 4s spectrum making its quantization indeterminate. It can also be noted from the 
XPS spectra in Figure 2-21 that the oxygen binding energy shifts from the surface region 
to the bulk of the film, which indicates that the oxygen is bound differently on the surface 
and after milling. This suggests two distinctly different films as shown in the cross 
sectional SEM in Figure 2-22.  

 43
 
Figure 2-21: XPS spectra of the reacted surface film and the sputtered lithium niobite. The surface is 
composed solely of lithium and oxygen while the main film contains niobium and oxygen and 
possibly lithium. The lithium 1s signal from the film bulk is washed out by the niobium 4s signal 
making positive identification difficult.

top of the main sputtered film. 
 

 44
 
After reacting the sputtered material with deionized water to remove the lithium 
oxide layer, the film visually appears as a dark material as shown in Figure 2-20. Lithium 
niobite has been reported to appear as: wine-red [79], bluish-black [79], garnet red [79], 
reddish brown [90, 120], black [90, 120], burgundy-red [75, 85, 86], grey [85], dark 
cherry [93], dark gray [86, 93], bourdeaux red [91], blue black shiny [91], brownish [76], 
burgundy [76], red [88, 92], black with a metallic shine [92], and gray-black [88]. The 
general trend throughout all of these reported colors is that lithium niobite with a near 
stoichiometric amount of lithium appears red corresponding to the 2 eV band gap while 
lithium niobite with a significant amount of lithium removed from the crystal appears 
dark and acts as a metal with the fermi level inside the valence band. The dark color of 
the sputtered material therefore suggests that the sputtered film is lithium deficient after 
reacting with the deionized water. As was discussed in Section 1.4.2, deionized water is 
known to remove approximately 11% of the lithium from lithium niobite [88]. 
 
While detecting lithium by XPS is difficult due to the overlapping Li 1s and Nb 
4s signals, Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) can detect lithium. Unfortunately, 
SIMS cannot quantitatively identify the amount of lithium without a known standard, 
which does not exist for lithium niobite. However, relative comparisons can be made 
between samples as shown in Figure 2-23 which shows depth profiles for both a sputtered 
film and a bulk piece of lithium niobite grown by liquid phase electro-epitaxy. From the 
SIMS specta, the Li/Nb signal ratio in the sputtered film is 6.24 ± 0.15 while the Li/Nb 
signal ratio in the bulk lithium niobite is 8.65 ± 0.19. Therefore the sputter deposited 
lithium niobite is lithium deficient compared to the bulk grown material. 

 45
 
Figure 2-23: SIMS depth profiles of (Left) sputter deposited lithium niobite and (Right) bulk grown 
lithium niobite. The lithium to niobium ratio is lower in the sputter deposited film likely due to 
reaction with deionized water removing lithium from the film. 
 
 
Lithium niobite has a reported band gap of approximately 2.0 eV [64, 75]. In 
order to determine the band gap of the standard lithium niobite deposition condition, a 
deposition was performed on double side polished sapphire. The double side polished 
wafer reduces optical scattering in transmission mode optical absorption spectroscopy. In 
order to determine the band gap from optical absorption spectroscopy, the Tauc method 
must be employed [121]. The Tauc method requires that the type of optical transition (i.e. 
allowed-direct, allowed-indirect, forbidden-direct, or forbidden-indirect) must be known 
before the method can be used. In lithium niobite, the Fermi-level is inside the valence 
band emptying electrons away from the gamma point. Therefore, optical absorption 
transitions occur at k-vectors away from the gamma point causing lithium niobite to have 
a forbidden-direct transition. A more in depth discussion of optical transitions in lithium 
niobite is provided in Chapter 4. 

 46
 
The Tauc plot for sputter deposited lithium niobite is shown in Figure 2-24. The 
band gap can be found by extrapolating the linear transition region to the x-axis yielding 
a band gap of 2.07 eV. 
 
Figure 2-24: Tauc plot of sputter deposited lithium niobite showing a 2.07 eV band gap. The Tuac 
coefficient for a Direct Forbidden transition was used because the band structure for lithium niobite 
causes direct optical transitions away from the gamma point. 
 
 
Having characterized the structural, chemical, and optical properties of sputter 
deposited lithium niobite, the purpose of exploring this material was to obtain electrically 
active memristors for neuromorphic computing applications. Contacts were evaporated 
onto a lithium niobite film in a ring-dot pattern [74]. Titanium/gold contacts were used in 
order to have a lithium blocking titanium layer [99] and a soft gold layer for probing. The 
effects of lithium blocking and lithium absorbing contacts will be discussed in Chapter 5. 

 47
As shown in Figure 2-25, the fabricated device exhibited the pinched hysteresis loop 
characteristic of a memristor. In addition to the memristive hysteresis loop, each 
successive scan caused the device to become more resistive resulting in a clockwise 
rotation in the current-voltage curve. This rotation is characteristic of a volatile memristor 
in which a feedback mechanism (such as lithium ion diffusion) can reset the device. 
Further modelling of this effect is discussed in Chapter 9. The neuromorphic application 
of a volatile memristor with feedback may be found in replicating biological volatile 
adaptation mechanisms. Specific volatile biological behaviors will be further discussed in 
Chapter 10 along with how to reproduce them using volatile memristors.

hysteresis.

2.5 Processing Parameters 
 
In order to investigate the effects of various deposition parameters on the physical 
and chemical properties of the deposited film, niobium target power, lithium oxide target 
power, operating pressure, and substrate temperature were varied around the standard 
deposition condition. 
 
Each film was structurally characterized by measuring the film thickness by stylus 
profilometer and the film crystallinity by XRD. An XRD crystallinity metric for each 
film was determined from the XRD peak height scaled by the sapphire substrate peak 
height and the film thickness. 
Chemical characterization of each film was performed by analyzing XPS 
measurements. The oxygen to niobium ratio was determined by dividing the total area 
under the O 1s peak by the area under the Nb 3d peak. Each area was scaled by known 
relative sensitivity factors for these peaks, which are 2.4 for niobium and 0.66 for oxygen 
[122]. In addition, the mean niobium oxidation state was calculated, according to 
Equation 2.2, from fitting the niobium XPS spectra.

∑
        ( )
   
   
 
Equation 2.2 
 
where n is the integer oxidation states of niobium (0 – 5) used to fit the measured XPS 
spectrum. These integer oxidation states exhibit doublets in XPS with known binding 
energies that shift to higher energy as niobium becomes oxidized [123]. All oxygen to 
niobium ratios and niobium oxidation states reported are measured from XPS spectra 

 49
after argon milling into the film. This procedure avoids sample to sample variations in 
surface oxide formation, but results in lower reported oxygen to niobium ratios than the 
actual film composition due to preferential sputtering removing more oxygen than 
niobium [119]. For example, XPS analysis of bulk grown lithium niobite yielded an 
oxygen to niobium ratio of 1.81, lower than the ideal value of 2. 
2.5.1 Niobium Target Power 
 
The niobium target power was varied between 30 W and 150 W. Over this range, 
the thickness of the deposited material increases nearly linearly at a rate of 5.6 nm/W as 
the niobium target power is increased, as shown in Figure 2-26. In addition, the 
crystallinity of the film, measured by normalized XRD intensity, increases rapidly for 
low niobium target powers and decreases slowly for higher niobium power, which may 
occur due to chemical changes in the film’s deposited with more niobium. Chemically, as 
shown in Figure 2-26, the niobium oxidation state decreases as the niobium target power 
increases. This is consistent with adding more niobium to the film and making the film 
more metal rich. The oxygen to niobium ratio also decreases as the niobium target power 
increases, although the film deposited with 40 W niobium power is an outlier from this 
trend. These chemical trends indicate a narrow niobium power range of 40 – 50 W 
wherein the desired Nb3+ oxidation state and 2:1 O:Nb ratio of lithium niobite are 
obtained.  This region also corresponds with the best XRD figures of merit as shown in 
Figure 2-26. 

 50
 
Figure 2-26: (Left) structural XRD and (Right) chemical XPS trends for changing niobium target 
power. 
 
2.5.2 Lithium Oxide Target Power 
 
The lithium oxide (Li2O) target power was varied between 100 W and 300 W. 
Over this range, the thickness of the deposited material increases as the Li2O target power 
is increased in a nearly linear manner at a rate of 1.55 nm/W, as shown in Figure 2-27. 
Unlike the range of niobium target powers investigated, the film crystallinity decreases 
throughout the entire range of Li2O target power. Not surprisingly, increasing the Li2O 
target power increases the oxidation state in the deposited film. This is consistent with 
adding more oxygen to the film. However, the measured oxygen to niobium ratio does 
not track with the niobium oxidation state and is mostly unchanged by changing the Li2O 
target power.   

 51

target power. 
 
2.5.3 Pressure 
 
The operating pressure was varied between 1 mTorr and 30 mTorr. Over this 
pressure range the mean free path of an atom should vary between 20 cm and 0.7 cm 
respectively according to the kinetic model for gas collisions shown in Equation 2.3. 
 
  
   
     
Equation 2.3 
 
where Γ is the mean free path, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, d is the 
diameter of an atom (Argon assumed), and P is pressure. The range of mean free paths 
investigated extends both longer and shorter than the 10 cm target to substrate distance 
spanning cases from molecular to viscous flow, which result in dramatically different 
energetic species impinging on the substrates. 
 
Increasing the pressure between 1 – 10 mTorr had little impact on the thickness of 
the deposited film, although the film crystallinity decreased over this range, as shown in 
Figure 2-28. The decrease in film crystallinity may be due to increased scattering as the 

 52
mean free path becomes shorter than the target to substrate distance. In sputter 
deposition, unscattered atoms carry a large amount of kinetic energy, typically 4 – 40 eV 
[98], which can provide the energy necessary for crystallization. The films deposited at 
pressures between 1 – 10 mTorr show only small increases to the niobium oxidation state 
and oxygen to niobium ratio. This small increase may be due to increased scattering of 
the larger niobium atoms compared to the smaller oxygen atoms. 
The film deposited at 30 mTorr is approximately 1/3 the thickness of the films 
deposited at lower pressures and exhibits an oxygen to niobium ratio approximately 2.5 
times higher than the films deposited at lower pressure despite a relatively unchanging 
niobium oxidation state. Since the oxygen to niobium ratio increased without increasing 
the niobium oxidation state, excess lithium must be incorporated into the film and while 
we cannot measure Li-O bonding with XPS, such bonding must exist. The film deposited 
at 30 mTorr also exhibits a higher crystallinity than the low pressure trend would predict 
which may be due to the change in chemical composition.

chamber pressure. 
 
2.5.4 Substrate Temperature 

 53
The substrate temperature was varied between room temperature and 800 oC. 
Unintentional heating of the substrate at room temperature was controlled by water 
cooling the platen. The measured temperature did not exceed 40 oC for the 
unintentionally heated films. As shown in Figure 2-29, increasing the substrate 
temperature to 500 oC had little effect on the film thickness, crystallinity, niobium 
oxidation state, or oxygen to niobium ratio. However, increasing the substrate 
temperature to 800 oC caused a decrease in the film thickness and crystallinity. The film 
deposited at 800 oC also exhibited a higher niobium oxidation state and higher oxygen to 
niobium ratio. In addition to the quantitative chemical measurements, the film deposited 
at 800 oC was transparent as opposed to the opaque films deposited at lower 
temperatures. The XRD peak for the 800 oC sample was also located at a slightly higher 
angle (2θ-ω = 36.87o) than all other films investigated (2θ-ω = 36.39o – 36.76o). Of the 
known Li-Nb-O compounds with XRD peaks near 2θ-ω = 36o – 37o, Li3NbO4 and 
LiNb3O8 are the only transparent compounds, with a band gap of approximately 4 eV 
[124, 125], having a higher ideal niobium oxidation state of Nb5+, and a higher angle 
XRD 2θ-ω peak than all other compounds in this range.  Thus, the 800 oC sample is 
likely dominated by Li3NbO4 or LiNb3O8.

temperature. 
 
 
In addition to the structural and chemical changes observed in the film deposited 
at 800 oC, the XRD reveals a weak low angle peak (18.6o) as shown in Figure 2-30. This 
peak is associated with α-LiAlO2. Conversion of sapphire into an interfacial layer of α-
LiAlO2 [126, 127] and γ-LiAlO2 [128] by lithium and lithium oxide at high temperatures 
has been previously shown and is energetically favorable as indicated by the negative 
calculated change in the Gibbs free energy. 
                   
                       
                     
 
Examining the cross sectional SEM for this film, shown in Figure 2-30, reveals an 
interfacial layer between the sapphire substrate and the main film likely due to the 
conversion of sapphire into LiAlO2.

showing the presence of lithium aluminate and an interface layer between the sapphire substrate and 
main film. It is proposed that excess lithium from the sputtering process can diffuse into and react 
with the sapphire substrate at this temperature. 
 
2.5.5 Platen Plasma 
 
The final sputter deposition parameter that can be controlled in the Denton 
Discovery 2 is the platen plasma power. The platen was attached to an RF source and 
depositions were performed for 30 minutes at 0 W, 20 W, and 50 W of platen power. As 
shown in Figure 2-31, the resulting XRD peaks for these films vary dramatically with 
platen plasma power. The 0 W standard condition exhibits a 2θ-ω XRD peak at 36.6o 
cooresponding to lithium niobite as previously observed. However, the films deposited 
with a non-zero platen plasma power have lower angle peaks that do not correspond to 
lithium niobite. Therefore, while it is sometimes suggested that ion bombardment from a 
platen plasma can have beneficial effects [104], a platen plasma does not aid in the 
sputter deposition of lithium niobite. 
 

 56

plasma etching during deposition appears detrimental to obtaining crystalline lithium niobite. 
 
2.5.6 Deposition Time 
 
One of the structural features observed in the standard deposition condition was a 
two layer structure with small particles near the sapphire substrate and the formation of 
tapered crystallites approximately 250 nm into the film. As discussed in Section 2.4, 
correlation of these features observed in SEM with the XRD data suggested that the low 
angle shoulder observed in XRD corresponded to the small particles while the main peak 
corresponded to the tapered crystallites. The standard deposition condition was repeated 
for a variety of deposition times in order to see how the XRD shoulder and main peak 
evolve. 

 57
 
As shown in Figure 2-32, a short 10 minute deposition produces a very weak and 
broad peak in the XRD. A longer 30 minute deposition produces an XRD peak that is 
predominately composed of the low angle shoulder with little to none of the primary 
36.6° lithium niobite XRD peak present. Lastly, the standard deposition condition 
deposited for 60 minutes produces a combination of the primary lithium niobite peak and 
the low angle shoulder as previously observed. This progression from a broad hump to 
only the shoulder feature to a combination of the shoulder and main peak suggests that as 
the deposited film grows thicker, crystalline material accumulates first in structures that 
produce the low angle XRD shoulder and then in structures that produce the primary 
lithium niobite XRD peak. These two structures are likely the small particles and tapered 
crystallites previously discussed. 

 58

from little crystalline material to forming the low angle shoulder XRD feature to a combined low 
angle shoulder and main lithium niobite XRD peak. 
 
2.5.7 Substrates 
 
Lithium niobite was sputter deposited onto a variety of substrates. Two features of 
interest in performing this deposition were a) how does the substrate lattice spacing affect 
the lithium niobite deposition and b) on what substrates is the sputter deposited lithium 
niobite stable? The first question concerns epitaxial alignment between the underlying 
substrate and the lithium niobite film. Such an epitaxial relation would be unusual for 
room temperature sputtered material. In addition, while (1 0 1) oriented lithium niobite 
has short range trigonal (3.07 Å spacing) and hexagonal (3.05 Å spacing) features, as 

 59
shown in Figure 2-33, no long range hexagonal pattern exists to form a traditional 
epitaxial relationship. 
 
Figure 2-33: (1 0 1) lithium niobite crystal plane showing both hexagonal and trigonal features but no 
long range repeating hexagonal or trigonal pattern to form an epitaxial relation. 
 
 
The second question concerning film stability originates from the mobile nature 
of lithium atoms. Many materials are capable of absorbing lithium as an interstitial atom. 
While this feature is useful for creating lithium ion battery anodes/cathodes, the 
volumetric expansion of the substrate is often catastrophic [129-133]. Depositions were 
performed on SiC, n-type GaN, semi-insulating GaN:Fe, AlN, LiTaO3, (1 1 1) oriented 
silicon, (1 0 0) oriented silicon, ZnO, epitaxial aluminum on silicon, and sputter 
deposited Nb on sapphire. 

 60
 
As shown in Figure 2-34, sputter deposition of lithium niobite onto SiC produced 
the same (1 0 1) lithium niobite peak in XRD and no features were visible when viewed 
with an optical microscope. Therefore deposition onto SiC appears stable as was 
previously reported for growth by molecular beam epitaxy [64].

on SiC. The SiC substrate XRD peaks are indicated with *. 
 
As shown in Figure 2-35, sputter deposition of lithium niobite onto n-type GaN 
produced the same (1 0 1) lithium niobite peak in XRD. It should be noted that an XRD 
peak at 17.08o is also present that could correspond to the (0 0 2) orientation of lithium 
niobite. However, this peak location also corresponds to a forbidden peak of GaN making 
positive identification difficult. Small grains are visible when the film is viewed under an 
optical microscope and small pits are present. It is assumed that these pits are caused by 
the underlying GaN template. 

 61

template peaks are indicated with #. 
 
As shown in Figure 2-36, sputter deposition of lithium niobite onto iron doped 
semi-insulating GaN:Fe produced the same (1 0 1) lithium niobite peak in XRD and that 
no features were visible when viewed with an optical microscope.

 62
As shown in Figure 2-37, sputter deposition of lithium niobite onto AlN produced 
the same (1 0 1) lithium niobite peak in XRD and that no features were visible when 
viewed with an optical microscope.

on an AlN template. The sapphire substrate XRD peaks are indicated with * while the AlN template 
peaks are indicated with #. 
 
As shown in Figure 2-38, sputter deposition of lithium niobite onto LiTaO3 
produced the same (1 0 1) lithium niobite peak in XRD. Cracking is visible in the film 
when viewed with an optical microscope likely due to the pyroelectric nature of LiTaO3 
[134]. 

 63

on LiTaO3. The LiTaO3 substrate XRD peaks are indicated with *. Film cracking is visible under 
optical magnification likely due to the pyroelectric nature of LiTaO3. 
 
Depositions of lithium niobite onto substrates that can absorb large quantities of 
lithium are expected to be unstable due to volumetric expansion of the substrate. 
Depositions onto silicon, epitaxial aluminum, and ZnO were all unstable with the films 
pealing as shown in Figure 2-39. For the silicon substrates, substrate orientation and 
surface preparation did not affect the film stability. 
 
Figure 2-39: Depositions performed on (1 1 1) oriented silicon, (1 1 1) oriented silicon cleaned with 
HF, (1 0 0) oriented silicon, and ZnO from left to right. All of these depositions produced unstable 
films that pealed likely due to lithium absorption into the substrate causing volumetric expansion of 
the substrate. 
 

 64
 
While deposition of lithium niobite onto smooth epitaxial aluminum produced an 
unstable film that pealed, one deposition on epitaxial aluminum remained stable. 
Examining the microstructure of this successful aluminum film, as shown in Figure 2-40, 
the aluminum film that produced a stable lithium niobite deposition grew in a columnar 
morphology with voids between the columns. The only difference between the films that 
produced unstable versus stable lithium niobite was the time spent in the vacuum transfer 
system (~miniminal versus 12 hours) suggesting the influence of oxidation in the 
formation of the nanostructured Al.  Using nanostructures to absorb the volumetric 
expansion of lithium intercalated materials has been explored for creating stable lithium 
ion battery anodes [131-133] and also led to a stable lithium niobite film.

sputter deposited lithium niobite on this substrate. The silicon substrate XRD peaks are indicated 
with * while the aluminum peaks are indicated with #. 
 
 
The final substrate explored was an in-situ sputter deposition of niobium onto a 
sapphire substrate followed by the standard lithium niobite deposition. As shown in 
Figure 2-41, the sputter deposited niobium has an XRD peak at 38.355o aligning with (1 
1 0) body-centered cubic niobium. The lithium niobite deposition then produces the same 

 65
(1 0 1) XRD peak previously observed. The ability to deposit lithium niobite onto a 
metallic surface without breaking vacuum may be useful for creating vertical devices 
based on lithium niobite. 
 
Figure 2-41: x-ray diffractogram of sputter deposited lithium niobite on sputter deposited niobium. 
 
In addition to examining the structural stability of lithium niobite films deposited 
on varying substrates, the crystallographic relationship between the deposited films and 
the substrates was examined. As shown in Figure 2-42, for substrates with lattice spacing 
less than the lattice spacing of lithium niobite the XRD peak location for the sputter 
deposited lithium niobite decreases with decreasing substrate lattice constant. This is 
consistent with the film under compressive strain increasing the out-of-plane crystal 
lattice thus decreasing the location of the XRD peak angle. 

 66
However, for substrates with lattice spacing greater than the lattice spacing of 
lithium niobite the XRD peak location decreases with increasing substrate lattice 
constant, as shown in Figure 2-42. This trend is opposite the expected trend indicating 
that some process other than strain to the underlying substrate is responsible for the 
crystal lattice parameters. 
One potential non-strain mechanism for changing the crystal lattice parameters is 
the absorption of lithium into the underlying substrate. Examining the four materials in 
Figure 2-42 with lattice spacings larger than lithium niobite, each substrate has 
progressively smaller atomic densities (SiC = 0.097 atoms/A3, AlN = 0.096 atoms/A3, 
GaN = 0.088 atoms/A3, Nb = 0.055 atoms/A3) creating more open space in the crystal 
lattice and the potential to absorb increasing amounts of lithium from the thin film 
lithium niobite. If lithium is absorbed from the thin film into the underlying substrate, the 
lattice parameters of the lithium niobite will change as shown in Figure 2-42. 

 67

2.5.8 ex-situ Annealing 
While the substrate affected the lithium niobite film’s structural stability during 
deposition, it is also desirable to know how ex-situ environmental effects affect the 
structural and chemical stability of the lithium niobite films. The thermal stability of the 
deposited lithium niobite was investigated by ex-situ annealing. A set of lithium niobite 
films was deposited at room temperature and then individual samples were annealed for 
one hour under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 400 – 700 oC. 
 

 68
 
Figure 2-43: x-ray diffractograms of sputter deposited lithium niobite annealed under vacuum at a 
variety of temperatures from 400 – 700 oC. 
 
As shown in Figure 2-43, there is very little qualitative change in the (1 0 1) 
lithium niobite XRD peak as a function of annealing temperature. The only notable 
change is a slight shift in the XRD peak to lower 2θ-ω angle as the annealing temperature 
is increased. As shown in Figure 2-44, the peak shifts as a nearly linear function of 
annealing temperature at a rate of 1.57 ± 0.06 arcsec/oC. This peak shift to lower angle 
corresponds to a larger spacing between the (1 0 1) crystalline planes. It has previously 
been shown that the crystalline lattice spacing of lithium niobite increases as lithium is 
removed from the crystal [90]. Loss of lithium from the crystal lattice when annealed 
under vacuum has been shown for lithium niobate [135]. Because lithium is more loosely 

 69
bound in lithium niobite than in lithium niobate, it is therefore likely that vacuum 
annealing causes a loss of lithium from lithium niobite and an associated shift in the XRD 
peak location.  Thus, it may be possible in the future to introduce an in-situ anneal so as 
to achieve stoichiometric lithium niobite instead of the supersatureated lithium niobite 
produced herein. 
 
Figure 2-44: Trend of XRD peak shift when sputter deposited lithium niobite is annealed for 1 hour 
under vacuum. 
 
 
Examining the broader range XRD scan for the 700 oC anneal, shown in Figure 
2-45, additional peaks are visible. These peaks correspond to multiple orientations of 
NbO2 suggesting that some of the lithium niobite (LiNbO2) has decomposed into NbO2 
by removing lithium from the material. 

 70
 
 
 
Figure 2-45: X-ray diffractograms of lithium niobite as-deposited and after annealing under vacuum 
at 700 oC. The annealing treatment caused a shift in the main XRD peak to lower angle consistent 
with removing lithium from the crystal. NbO2 XRD peaks also appeared after annealing suggesting 
that some of the LiNbO2 lost all of its lithium. 
 
Sputter deposited lithium niobite therefore appears sensitive to elevated 
temperatures under vacuum as lithium can be removed from the film. This effect can 
eventually lead to the film decomposing into NbO2. 
 
2.6 Alternate Deposition Condition 
 

 71
While the standard lithium niobite deposition condition is well understood and 
produces functional memristive devices, the two layer structure with tapered crystallites 
and the reactivity with air are not ideal attributes. As previously noted in Section 2.4, the 
reactivity with air is likely due to excess lithium in the film. This excess lithium results 
from trying to form LiNbO2 from a linear combination of Li2O and Nb. In order to 
address the problem of excess lithium, a new deposition condition was found by lowering 
the power to the lithium oxide target, raising the power to the niobium target and 
introducing oxygen as a reactive gas to the sputtering plasma. Details on this deposition 
condition can be found in Appendix A. 
As shown in Figure 2-46, the new deposition condition also produces single 
orientation (1 0 1) lithium niobite. Examining the (2 0 2) XRD peak it is also apparent 
that the new deposition condition produces a single XRD peak with no shoulder. The lack 
of two XRD features suggests that the new deposition condition may also consist of a 
single layer structure rather than the two layer structure observed from the standard 
deposition condition. 
 
Figure 2-46: X-ray diffractograms of (Left) the standard lithium niobite deposition condition and 
(Right) a new deposition condition that adds reactive oxygen to the plasma. By adding oxygen to the 

 72
plasma both the air reactivity due to excess lithium and the two layer structure appear to have been 
solved. 
 
 
The cross sectional SEM image shown in Figure 2-47 confirms that the new 
deposition condition produces a single structural layer without tapered crystallites. In 
addition, the XRD rocking curve of the new deposition condition, shown in Figure 2-47, 
has a full width at half maximum of 164 arcsec indicating a low degree of tilt between 
crystalline planes. The penalty for this improved XRD figure of merit is a highly 
columnar structure which may be suitable for some applications and not for others.

crystalline material and (Right) cross sectional SEM of the new deposition condition showing a single 
structural layer to the film.

CHAPTER 3 
RADIATION TOLERANCE OF LITHIUM NIOBITE 
As the amount of information gathered in space increases through the use of 
satellites, telescopes, and space stations, a complementary increase occurs in the amount 
of information transmitted back to Earth. In order to reduce the bandwidth requirements 
for satellites, more processing will have to be performed in space. Neuromorphic 
computers are a good candidate for this type of processing, being particularly useful for 
pattern recognition. By replicating the functionality of the brain, these computers also 
replicate the brain’s ability to recognize patterns and exclude extraneous data while 
minimizing power consumption [34]. In order for any neuromorphic architecture to 
provide reliable computation in space, the material and devices must be radiation tolerant 
and their radiation response must be known. 
 
To explore the application of lithium niobite (LiNbO2) memristors in space based 
circuitry, devices were exposed to 1.8 MeV proton radiation. In addition to observing the 
direct effects of proton radiation on the memristors, room-temperature self-healing 
mechanisms were observed due to highly mobile lithium ions. Two-terminal memristive 
devices were tested on both thin film and thick bulk material, and the effects of proton 
damage on the small signal impedance was analyzed. 
Density of states and wave-function calculations performed on lithium niobite 
predict electrical conduction predominantly in the niobium oxide layers with significant 
contributions from metal-metal bonding [82]. NMR relaxation studies indicate that the 
lithium ions have an activation energy on the order of 100 meV and an average residence 
time on the order of 100 µs before hopping to a neighboring site in the lithium plane, 

 74
making Li highly mobile and LiNbO2 memristors rapidly programmable [75, 76]. While 
lithium niobite is a 2 eV semiconductor, it has an intrinsic Fermi level near the valence 
band edge and exhibits semi-metallic conduction [90]. Lithium is often deintercalated to 
form sub-stoichiometric LixNbO2, where the lithium vacancies act as acceptors, lowering 
the Fermi level inside the valence band [82]. When an electric field is applied, these 
lithium vacancies freely drift across the material changing the doping profile of the 
device [73]. These unique physical and electronic properties of lithium niobite affect the 
radiation damage and recovery mechanisms. 
 
3.1 Experimental Setup 
 
The devices used in this study were annular ring-dot structures, as shown in 
Figure 3-1. These devices were packaged into custom high frequency packages with gold 
wire bonds and SMA connectors. The added resistance from packaging was less than 2 
ohms, which has been subtracted out of the measurement using an in situ calibration 
standard with known open, short, and load impedances [136, 137]. 

 75
 
Figure 3-1: Schematic of the ring-dot devices fabricated for the radiation study. 
 
Two terminal lithium niobite memristors were irradiated with 1.8 MeV protons to 
seven fluences between 1012 and 1014 cm-2 using the Pelletron particle accelerator at 
Vanderbilt University. During irradiation and annealing the devices were ungrounded and 
unbiased. At each fluence, a series of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) 
measurements were taken to characterize the low frequency resistance and the lithium ion 
mobility. The EIS measurements record the small signal impedance of the device as a 
function of frequency from 40 Hz to 100 MHz. These data can be used to separate the 
electronic and ionic contributions to the device impedance because the ions can respond 
to the signal at low frequencies, contributing to the impedance, but cannot respond to the 
signal at higher frequencies at which only electronic conduction occurs [138]. A typical 
spectrum for a lithium niobite memristor is shown in Figure 3-2. 

 76
 
Figure 3-2: Typical electrochemical impedance spectra for a lithium niobite device. 
 
At low frequencies the mobile lithium ions are able to track with the applied 
voltage creating polarization dipoles that reduce the internal electric field. The resultant 
reduction in current corresponds to an increased resistance. As the frequency increases, 
lithium ions are no longer able to track the applied voltage. This causes a phase shift 
between the applied signal and the polarization of the slowly moving ions resulting in a 
capacitive reactance and a decrease in the resistance as the polarization no longer fully 
opposes the applied field. At high frequencies the lithium ions can no longer respond to 
the applied voltage, and the reactance and the polarization contribution to the resistance 
each approach zero. 

 77
Because of the expectation for rapid annealing due to highly mobile lithium ions, 
EIS measurements were performed in situ in order to examine the effects of short-term 
annealing immediately after radiation exposure. Due to the decreased RF impedance from 
longer cables and feedthrough connectors needed to reach into the beamline vacuum 
chamber, EIS was limited to frequencies less than 5 MHz. 
TRIM Monte Carlo simulations of the described experiment, shown in Figure 3-3, 
predict a maximum damage range of 40 µm for 1.8 MeV protons in LiNbO2 and a 
maximum range of approximately 42 µm. Since the proton range is large and could result 
in implantation of hydrogen, both thin film material (0.2 µm) and bulk material (~110 
µm) were used in order to compare displacement damage in the thin film sample with the 
additional implantation of hydrogen possible in the bulk sample. Such hydrogen 
implantation could result in the passivation of electrically active defects or act as a 
compensating donor due to the chemical similarity of hydrogen and lithium. The 110 µm 
thick bulk material was grown by liquid phase electro-epitaxy [95] and subsequently 
polished. The 200 nm thin film material was sputter deposited onto a sapphire substrate. 
Two devices of each type were tested for this experiment.

niobium vacancies formed as a function of depth when lithium niobite is exposed to 1.8 MeV proton 
radiation. 
 
3.2 Results 
3.2.1 Initial Radiation Damage 
The average resistance between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz was measured by EIS as an 
indication of the combined electronic-ionic resistance, as shown in Figure 3-4. This 
frequency range covers the frequencies most common in biological neurons and thus is 
the resistance most relevant to a neuromorphic circuit. 

 79
 
Figure 3-4: Device resistance as a function of frequency for a typical lithium niobite memristor. The 
measurements are repeatable across multiple scans. The range of data that is averaged for the 
radiation study is indicated. This low frequency range is the measured range most relevant to 
neuromorphic computing. 
 
As the total proton fluence increased, the initial low frequency resistance 
decreased, as shown in Figure 3-5 for the thin film device. 

 80
 
Figure 3-5: Trends in initial device resistance as a function of total proton dose. The resistance of 
each device is normalized to its pre-radiation resistance. 
 
These data follow the exponential trend, given in Equation 3.1 for the thin film 
samples, which fits the data with a coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.994. 
                       
    
                
Equation 3.1 
 
This trend indicates that approximately 63% of the maximum possible damage 
had occurred at a fluence of 1.0x1014 ± 1.8x1013 cm-2 and that 1.8 MeV proton irradiation 
can change the initial low frequency resistance by a maximum of 0.76 ± 0.087%. While 
this exponential trend fits well over the range of fluences tested, other damage 
mechanisms may dominate at higher fluences causing the trend to deviate from actual 
device performance. 

 81
The bulk sample followed a similar trend with a 1/e point at 1.3x1014 cm-2 and a 
maximum resistance change of 0.28%. The lower percent change in the bulk sample is 
consistent with only a portion of the material being affected. 
The bulk device was modeled as two parallel resistors, shown in Figure 3-6, 
where radiation damage affects the top resistor R1 while leaving the underlying material 
beyond the 42 µm range (R2) unchanged, consistent with TRIM calculations in Figure 
3-3.  
 
Figure 3-6: Two layer resistance model showing radiation induced changes to the top 40 microns of 
bulk material predicted from the TRIM calculations and a 70 micron thick layer that remains 
unchanged. 
 
To eliminate the possible effects of proton implantation on the resistivity changes 
in the memristors, the resulting damage in the thin and thick samples were compared. The 

 82
bulk device two resistor model is evaluated both using the expected thicknesses from the 
TRIM simulation and the radiation induced changes using the percent change observed in 
the thin film device. If these two resistance ratios are identical then the proton 
implantation has minimal effect. The TRIM Monte Carlo simulation predicts a 42 µm 
range of radiation damage with a peak in damage near 40 µm. Using a thickness for R1 of 
41 ± 1 µm and a total thickness of 110 ± 5 µm, the ratio between R1 and R2 can be 
evaluated as shown in Equation 3.2. 
  
   
   
    
   
    
 
  
   
    
               
Equation 3.2 
 
where ρ, l, and w are the resistivity, length, and width of the device, respectively. Given 
that these quantities will not change between the two layers for the un-irradiated material, 
the resistance ratio then reduces to a ratio of the thicknesses h1 and h2, which is 1.68 ± 
0.13. 
Evaluating the two resistor model as a function of radiation damage, Equation 3.3 
and Equation 3.4 are produced, where Equation 3.3 describes the total device resistance 
of two parallel resistors and Equation 3.4 describes the total device resistance after 
radiation assuming that the top material R1 is changed by the same percentage as the thin 
film sample, which should be absent of significant proton implantation.

Equation 3.4 
 

 83
Evaluating Equation 3.3 and 3.4 with the measured initial and post-radiation 
resistances gives R1 = 11.8 ± 0.26 Ω and R2 = 7.38 ± 0.26 Ω and a resistance ratio of 
R1/R2  = 1.60 ± 0.066. This value is well within the range modelled in Equation 3.2 
suggesting that the effects of irradiation are the same on the bulk and thin film devices 
and that hydrogen implantation does not significantly affect the device performance. 
3.2.2 Short Term Annealing 
To examine the short term annealing at each fluence, several post-irradiation 
measurements were made from 3 minutes to 15 minutes. For all fluences greater than 
1013 cm-2, the resistance recovered indicating short-term annealing as shown in Figure 
3-7 for the maximum fluence tested, 1014 cm-2. 

 84
 
Figure 3-7: Resistance as a function of frequency for a lithium niobite memristor radiated with 1014 
ions/cm2 protons. Successive measurements show the device resistance increasing back toward the 
pre-radiation value indicating room-temperature annealing and self-healing of radiation damage. 
 
The time-dependent resistance recovery followed an exponential trend with a time 
constant of 9.15 minutes, as shown in Equation 3.5, for the same 1014 cm-2 proton 
irradiation case.  
 ( )             
          
Equation 3.5 
 
For fluences less than 1013 cm-2 no statistically valid self-healing was observed. 
The standard deviation for measured resistances between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz during a 
single scan varied from 0.25 ohms to 0.3 ohms (0.02% error). Since the maximum change 

 85
in the average low frequency resistance across the five successive EIS measurements was 
less than the standard deviation for a single measurement, no statistically valid self-
healing occurs at these low fluences. 
 
3.3 Discussion 
3.3.1 Damage Mechanisms 
Radiation damage can generally be divided into four mechanisms: (a) Impurity 
production through nuclear interactions, (b) Charge trapping through direct ionization or 
through charge implantation, (c) Local heating, and (d) Displacement damage. 
(a) Impurity production through nuclear reactions is not expected to contribute to 
the radiation damage observed in this study. While 7Li has a relatively unstable nucleus 
and a cross section of 60 mb for 1.8 MeV protons [139], given the maximum penetration 
depth of 40 µm and a total proton fluence of 1x1014 cm-2, the maximum density of 
dopants that could be created is on the order of 1016 cm-3 assuming every proton created a 
dopant. While this assumption is extremely unlikely, it still results in a change several 
orders of magnitude lower than the expected density of acceptors (1021 cm-3) due to 
lithium vacancies and would leave the doping profile relatively unchanged. 
(b) Ionization and charge trapping are not expected to contribute to the radiation 
damage in lithium niobite due to the material’s semi-metallic nature, which will quickly 
neutralize any created charge. In addition, due to the high density of acceptors in lithium 
niobite, the density of charge created by ionizing radiation is expected to be orders of 
magnitude smaller than the free carrier density. For this reason, charge trapping is also 
not expected to affect thin film devices grown on an insulating substrate because any 

 86
charge redistribution within the lithium niobite will be much smaller than the free charge 
carrier density. 
(c) While any heat generated from the proton beam could enhance the diffusion of 
displacement damage, local heating from the proton radiation is not expected to 
contribute to the radiation damage effects due to the low power of the proton beam – 
approximately 4 mW/cm2. Thermal simulations of lithium niobite under measurement 
conditions predict temperature changes less than 1 oC. 
(d) Displacement damage is expected to be the primary damage mechanism for 
proton irradiation through the creation of vacancies and interstitial atoms. The devices 
tested in this study were sub-stoichiometric in lithium based on the initial resistance of 
the tested devices. Because sub-stoichiometric lithium niobite already contains large 
numbers of lithium vacancies, it is expected that additional lithium vacancies will not 
significantly contribute to the effects of proton irradiation. Effects due to displacement 
damage will likely result from lithium interstitials in the niobium oxide layers or niobium 
and oxygen vacancies and interstitials. TRIM Monte Carlo simulations, shown in Figure 
4, predict approximately 3 times the density of niobium and oxygen vacancies compared 
to lithium vacancies. 

 87
 
Figure 3-8: x-ray diffractograms of lithium niobite before and after proton radiation. A shift in XRD 
peak position indicates an increase in the lattice spacing while an increase in the 2θ-ω peak width 
indicates a decrease in the lattice spacing consistency. 
 
Using x-ray diffraction, shown in Figure 3-8, a previous radiation study of lithium 
niobite demonstrated an increase in the crystal’s c-spacing, a decrease in the c-spacing 
consistency, and a decrease in the grain orientation consistency [137]. This result is 
consistent with interstitial atoms displaced to random locations in the crystal lattice. 
The reduced impedance observed upon exposure to large fluences of proton 
radiation is consistent with lithium ions becoming trapped within radiation induced 
vacancies. The low frequency impedance is largely controlled by the ability of lithium 
ions to freely move, creating an internal polarization field that opposes the applied 

 88
voltage. By trapping the lithium ions within radiation induced defects, the induced 
polarization decreases resulting in a smaller impedance. 
3.3.2 Self-Healing / Short-term Annealing 
The expected proton damage mechanism in lithium niobite is from the creation of 
vacancies, interstitial atoms and Frenkel pairs through displacement damage. Therefore 
any short-term annealing will be caused by the diffusion and recombination of these 
defects. Work with silicon has shown an enhancement to short-term annealing when there 
are excess free charge carriers from either carrier injection or radiation induced 
generation [140]. While no injection annealing is expected from the low voltage EIS 
measurements, rapid short-term annealing is expected in lithium niobite due to the high 
concentrations of mobile lithium ions and the semi-metallic nature of lithium niobite. 
Due to the observation of a single time constant in the short-term annealing data 
and the wide range of atomic masses in lithium niobite, it is likely that diffusion from 
only one type of atom is responsible for the majority of the room temperature annealing. 
As lithium is extremely mobile at room temperature with a 100 µs residence time [75] 
and the proposed damage mechanism does not involve direct lithium displacement, it is 
unlikely that lithium is directly responsible for the short term annealing. Of the two 
remaining atoms, oxygen and niobium, the lower mass of oxygen makes it favorable for 
short-term annealing. The diffusion of either of these atoms back to their original site, 
freeing the trapped lithium, would result in more lithium-induced polarization and an 
increase in the low frequency impedance as observed. 
 
3.4 Summary of Lithium Niobite Radiation Tolerance 

 89
Lithium niobite (LiNbO2) exhibits small changes in resistance when exposed to 
1.8 MeV proton irradiation up to fluences of 1014 ions/cm-2. At the maximum fluence 
tested, 1014 ions/cm-2, the device resistance changed by 0.48%. An exponential fit to the 
resistance change indicates a saturation in the damage effects occurs at 0.75% change in 
the resistance. Both thin and thick film memristors were examined and found to behave 
similarly. Even though proton irradiation was shown to produce significant lattice 
damage as determined from x-ray diffraction measurements, the effect of this damage on 
the resistance changes was small. This resistance change due to radiation damage is 
attributed to displacement damage primarily at niobium and oxygen lattice sites trapping 
lithium ions that significantly contribute to the low frequency impedance. Short-term 
annealing is observed after radiation exposure with an annealing time constant of 9.15 
minutes. This short-term annealing is attributed to the diffusion of the displaced niobium 
and oxygen back to their original sites freeing the trapped lithium ions. The observation 
of only one time constant in the short-term annealing data makes it likely that only one 
atomic species is free to move at room temperature. 
Due to the small effect that proton irradiation had on the lithium niobite device 
performance and the fact that radiation damage in space for these devices would 
predominantly occur due to protons [141], it is expected that lithium niobite is a suitable 
material for neuromorphic computing in space applications.

CHAPTER 4 
OPTICALLY MEDIATED BAND-STRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS 
IN LITHIUM NIOBITE 
Multi-functional materials that couple mechanical, electrical, optical, and 
magnetic properties are important for future system designs. Lithium niobite (LiNbO2), a 
multi-functional sub-oxide of lithium niobate (LiNbO3), has been researched in a wide 
variety of fields including superconductor physics [85], battery materials [90], and 
memristive devices [21] because of its unusual band structure and the resulting electronic 
properties [82]. LiNbO2 is a 2 eV band-gap semiconductor that is degenerately hole 
doped by lithium vacancies forming LixNbO2. Previous research has shown: a density of 
states similar to high temperature cuprate superconductors [82, 84], a low temperature 
superconducting transition [85], both semiconducting [90] and metallic [88] temperature 
dependent resistivity, highly mobile lithium ions [75, 76], and memristive behavior [21, 
74]. 
X-ray diffraction data identifies lithium niobite as a layered material with niobium 
oxide layers separated by sheets of loosely bound lithium ions as shown in Figure 4-1.  
Niobium atoms with a nominal valence of 3+ occupy trigonal-prismatic sites between 
oxygen atoms [79]. As lithium is removed from the material, niobium and oxygen within 
a layer move closer together while the separation between the niobium oxide layers 
increases. This leaves the c-parameter relatively independent of lithium content, but the 
a-parameter increases as lithium is removed from the crystal [90]. In this way, the band 
structure is modified by the removal of Li and the subsequent structural changes. 
However, the removal of lithum has been shown to also change the occupation of the 

 91
bands and thus, two mechanisms for band structure modification are possible by removal 
of Li enhancing its multi-functional utility [73]. Previous work reported more than a two 
order of magnitude change in resistivity due to changes in lithium content [90]. 
Additionally, changes in the magnetic moment have been reported [90], but there is some 
disagreement about the magnetic nature of lithium niobite in the literature [82, 89]. 
 
Figure 4-1: Physical structure of lithium niobite with layers of trigonal-prismatic niobium oxide 
separated by sheets of mobile lithium ions. 
 
4.1 Theoretical Band Structure of Lithium Niobite 
 

 92
Band structure calculations predict that electron states nearest the Fermi energy 
are comprised primarily of niobium 4d and oxygen 2p electron states. Due to crystal 
field-splitting in the trigonal-prismatic system, the hybridized Nb 4d – O 2p states should 
form three bands, (dxy, dx
2- y
2), (dz
2), and (dxz, dyz).  However, there exist alternative 
views [82, 84, 89] of the explicit makeup of each of these three bands.  Regardless of the 
source of each band, unanimity exists that the lowest band is a deep “valence” band 
irrelevant to the present photoluminescence because it remains occupied due to 
insufficient photon energy for promotion from this band.  The Fermi energy is predicted 
to be between the top two bands forming a semiconductor band gap. In the rigid-band 
picture, as lithium is removed from the crystal the Fermi energy drops into the valence 
band forming a p-type degenerately doped semiconductor. Band structure calculations 
also show that the conduction band around the gamma point is flat suggesting very heavy 
conduction electrons [82, 84]. While it is not expected that these states would be 
thermally occupied, the flat conduction band should be revealed in optical measurements. 
Band structure calculations were previously made for varying niobium to oxygen 
distances in order to simulate varying concentrations of lithium.  This is a reasonable 
approximation because the bands of interest are almost entirely made from niobium and 
oxygen orbitals.  These calculations predict that as lithium is removed from the crystal 
and the niobium to oxygen distance decreases, the crystal should transition from a direct 
to an indirect band structure [82]. Until now, there has been no experimental evidence in 
support of this band structure modification via intercalation/deintercalation. 
 
4.2 Experimental Setup 

 93
 
Photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed on lithium niobite to confirm the 
predicted band structure features including a flat conduction band, a partially empty, 
degenerately doped, valence band caused by the removal of lithium, and a transition from 
a direct band-gap semiconductor to an indirect band-gap semiconductor. 
 
Single crystals of lithium niobite were grown by liquid phase electro-epitaxy 
following the previously published method [95]. Free standing crystals were removed 
from the molten solution and mechanically polished with grit ranging from 9 µm to 60 
nm. The resultant crystals were approximately 100 µm thick. 
 
Photoluminescence was stimulated using a 325nm HeCd laser with output power 
of 18mW which was filtered, collimated, and focused onto the sample to an estimated 
100-300 µm diameter spot size.  The resultant photoluminescence was filtered with a 331 
nm long-pass filter to remove the reflected laser light and prevent the formation of 
harmonics within the SPEX 1403 2 meter monochromator. The photoluminescence 
spectrum was measured using a Products for Research Inc. GaAs:Cs-0 11 stage PMT 
detector mounted on the spectrometer. The measurements were limited by the PMT 
spectral response and the laser line filter to a range from 350nm (3.54 eV) to 800nm (1.55 
eV). 
 
Samples were mounted to a Janis open cycle cryogenic stage using carbon tape.  
The tape was shown to have no photoluminescence at room temperature and negligible 
intensity luminescence at cryogenic temperatures. Temperature dependent measurements 
were taken from 78 K to 300 K.  The sample was not exposed to the laser during 
transitions between temperatures. 

 94
 
Modification of the lithium content in lithium niobite was performed by 
deintercalation of lithium in either 37% HCl or 20% HCl diluted in deionized water 
following the methods previously published [88]. Previous work indicates that this 
method of deintercalation should not remove more than 30% of the lithium from the 
crystal [88]. Since the same sample was used for various deintercalation levels, 
experimental measurement of the lithium content after each deintercalation was not 
possible as lithium content is typically observed by destructive measurements such as 
ICP-AES or TOF-SIMS using standards for quantification that do not exist. Non-
destructive surface measurements capable of detecting lithium, such as XPS, do not 
reveal any information about the bulk of the crystal and are complicated by an 
overlapping niobium signal. 
 
4.3 Photoluminescence Spectroscopy 
 
4.3.1 Room Temperature Photoluminescence 
 
Room temperature photoluminescence of as-grown lithium niobite, shown in 
Figure 4-2, shows a single band of transitions around the expected band-gap of 2 eV 
indicating band-to-band transitions. While room temperature photoluminescence has 
been observed in several complex oxide materials such as perovskites [142],  it is unusual 
to see photoluminescence in battery cathode materials which by design have large 
numbers of vacancy defects and highly mobile ions. The existence of strong room 
temperature photoluminescence in LiNbO2 may be due to the unique heavy mass 
electron’s inability to move to and interact with these defects. 

 95
 
Figure 4-2: Room temperature photoluminescence of as grown lithium niobite showing a single band-
to-band transition around 2eV. 
 
Looking only over the energy range of this band, shown in Figure 4-3, this band 
of transitions can be fit with three Gaussian curves centered at 1.92 eV (Peak A), 1.95 eV 
(Peak B), and 2.06 eV (Peak C). The full width at half of the maximum intensity for this 
band of transitions is 218 meV, which is almost 8.5 times the expected thermal width for 
a band-to-band transition. This increased line width is consistent with near band gap 
transitions in other degenerately doped semiconductors [143] and with other fast ion 
conductor materials [144]. 

 96
 
Figure 4-3: Room temperature photoluminescence of as grown lithium niobite fit to three Gaussian 
peaks showing a broad range of transitions consistent with a range of transitions from a flat 
conduction band to a partially empty valence band. 
 
 
Examining the three fitted peaks in Figure 4-3 and the expected band structure in 
Figure 4-4, it is possible to assign transitions to the three fitted peaks. Peak A is a broad 
peak centered at the lowest energy, and is consistent with transitions from the bottom of 
the flat conduction band down to the partially empty valence band. Peak B is slightly 
higher in energy than peak A, but is narrower and has less intensity. Peak B is consistent 
with a transition from thermally excited electrons in the second nearly degenerate 
conduction sub-band down to the partially empty valence band.  Peak C is consistent with 
transitions near the A point k-vector with a slightly wider energy gap and a predicted 

 97
higher density of valence states [82] resulting in a more intense emission. These three 
transitions are shown in Figure 4-4 as bands of transitions on the expected band structure. 
 
Figure 4-4: Relevant portions of the calculated band structures of lithium niobite reproduced from 
data in Ylvisaker et al.4 The direct band structure of stoichiometric lithium niobite is shown with the 
three observed photoluminescence transitions from a flat conduction band to a degenerate valence 
band. 
 
4.3.2 Temperature Dependent Photoluminescence 
 
Temperature dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy was performed at 
temperatures ranging from 78 K to 300 K. As shown in Figure 4-5, the PL intensity 
increases significantly at lower temperatures consistent with a reduction in non-radiative 
recombination due to phonon scattering. In addition to temperature dependent changes in 
intensity, the primary peak energy and the distribution of emitted light also change with 
temperature. 

 98
 
Figure 4-5: Temperature dependent photoluminescence of as grown lithium niobite showing the 
expected increase in intensity as temperature decreases. 
 
Comparing the spectra at 78 K and 300 K, shown in Figure 4-6 with normalized 
intensity, the peak intensity shifts 108 meV to a higher energy at lower temperatures and 
the low energy shoulder is suppressed. The peak shifting to higher energy is consistent 
with a decrease in the lattice parameters at lower temperature causing a widening of the 
band gap. The low energy shoulder in the room temperature spectrum, fitted to peak B in 
Figure 4-3, is attributed to transitions from thermally excited electrons in the nearly 
degenerate sub-conduction band. The suppression of these transitions at low temperature 
supports this conclusion. 

 99
 
Figure 4-6: A comparison of the room temperature and cryogenic photoluminescence spectra for 
lithium niobite showing a shift in the luminescence intensity and a suppression of the low energy 
shoulder at low temperature. 
 
 
Temperature dependent photoluminescence of band to band transitions can be fit 
to the temperature dependent band gap Equation 4.1 to find the band gap at 0 Kelvin 
Eg(0), the crossover temperature β, and the linear temperature coefficient α [145]. 
  ( )    ( )  
   
    
Equation 4.1 
This equation has two regimes split around the crossover temperature β. At low 
temperature (T << β) the temperature dependence follows a quadratic form while at high 
temperature (T >> β) it follows a linear form. 
For a non-degenerately doped semiconductor, the photoluminescence peak 
position could be fit to Equation 4.1. However, because the Fermi energy is inside the 

 
100 
valence band in this degenerately doped material, the transitions extend to states well past 
the valence band edge as shown in Figure 4-4. Due to this degeneracy, it is incorrect to 
use the energy at peak intensity from the photoluminescence spectra as the band gap 
energy.  Instead, a lower energy should be chosen for fits to the temperature dependent 
band gap equation, shown in Equation 4.1. Two separate fits were made using the 
temperature dependent photoluminescence data at 10% and 50% the maximum intensity 
corresponding to the calculated [82] (1.9 eV) and experimentally observed [64] (2.0 eV) 
band gap.  As will be shown, the results of the two fits show negligible differences in the 
α/β ratio indicating the band gap shifts are independent of the changes in shape of the 
photoluminescence spectra with temperature. 
Fitting the measured data for lithium niobite to Equation 4.1 predicts a crossover 
temperature much larger than the measured temperature range (β >> 300K) suggesting 
that the data is best fit by the quadratic region of Equation 4.1. Simplifying Equation 4.1 
to the quadratic form, shown in Equation 4.2, the data can be fit with a coefficient of 
determination R2 > 0.95. 
  ( )    ( )  
 
    
Equation 4.2 
 
The zero kelvin band gap Eg(0) for the 50% maximum intensity fit is determined 
to be 2.04 eV accurately matching data from absorption measurements previously 
published [64]. Eg(0) for the 10% maximum intensity fit is 1.91 eV matching the 
calculated band gap [82]. The ratios α/β are respectively 1.63x10-6 and 1.32x10-6 for 
these two fits, consistent with other semiconductor materials such as 7.4x10-7 for silicon 
and 2.7x10-6 for GaAs [145]. 

 
101 
 
The width of the photoluminescence spectra decreases as the temperature 
decreases at a rate of 4.1x10-4 eV/K. This is much larger than the Boltzmann constant 
(8.6x10-5 eV/K) providing further evidence that the width of the photoluminescence 
spectra is not limited by thermal broadening. 
4.3.3 Stoichiometric Dependence on Photoluminesence 
 
As shown in Figure 4-7, lithium niobite samples with sub-stoichiometric lithium 
content, LixNbO2, exhibited a 52 meV shift in the photoluminescence spectrum as well as 
additional higher energy transitions around 2.67 eV. The shift in the primary peak to 
higher energy is consistent with the addition of lithium vacancy dopants (acceptors) that 
lower the Fermi energy further into the valence band. Examining the calculated band 
structure, shown in Figure 4-4, the appearance of a higher energy transition is consistent 
with transitions to the local valence band maxima around the K and H k-vectors. 
According to the calculated band structure for various mole fractions of lithium, lowering 
the Fermi level to the local maxima at the K and H k-vectors requires the removal of 
approximately 20% of the lithium from the crystal4 which is easily attainable using HCl 
[88]. 

 
102 
 
Figure 4-7: A comparison of lithium niobite photoluminescence as grown and with lithium 
chemically removed.  The chemically treated sample exhibits a shift in the primary peak and 
additional higher energy transitions. 
 
 
When the lithium niobite sample was deintercalated in 37% HCl for 72 hours it 
exhibited no observable photoluminescence as shown in Figure 4-8. This is consistent 
with but not conclusive proof of the predicted transition to an indirect band gap 
semiconductor with increased non-radiative recombination. Alternatively, this could be 
due to a dramatic loss of crystallinity or a different band structure modification resulting 
in higher mobility electrons in the conduction band that are then able to interact with 
defects through non-radiative recombination. However, no degredation of the material 
was observed in this work or in the cited deintercalation study for samples exposed to 
HCl [88]. 

 
103 
 
Figure 4-8: A comparison of lithium niobite photoluminescence as grown and with chemically treated 
with HCl 37% for 72 hours. The chemically treated sample exhibits no observable 
photoluminescence suggesting that the predicted transition from a direct to indirect band gap 
semiconductor when sufficient lithium is removed is correct. 
 
 
4.4 Opto-Ionic Coupling 
 
 
Initial photoluminescence measurements revealed unexpected spectral shifts 
between successive measurements mimicking the changes resulting from lithium 
deintercalation. Shown in Figure 4-9 are the photoluminescence spectra for an as grown 
sample, the as grown sample after prolonged (30 minute) exposure to the UV laser, and 
the sample after chemical removal of lithium. Both the optically saturated and chemically 
deintercalated spectra show a shift in the primary peak toward higher energy and the 
appearance of higher energy transitions. Given the similarity in the chemically 

 
104 
deintercalated and the optically saturated spectra, these results are consistent with the UV 
laser coupling to the highly mobile lithium ions and moving the ions out of the laser spot 
such that later measurements sampled a range of lithium concentrations. While the high 
energy tail of the chemically deintercalated and optically saturated spectra are nearly 
identical, the additional intensity observed in the optically saturated spectra, around 2.5 
eV, is attributed to sampling a range of lithium concentrations in the optically saturated 
sample rather than a single concentration in the chemically treated sample. 
 
Figure 4-9: A comparison of lithium niobite photoluminescence as grown, optically saturated with 
the UV laser, and chemically treated.  The optically saturated material exhibits several features 
similar to the chemically treated sample including a shift in the peak energy and additional higher 
energy transitions. 
 
 
The enhanced movement of atoms by UV annealing is a well-known phenomenon 
[146]. Previous NMR work on lithium niobite has shown an activation energy for lithium 

 
105 
movement on the order of 100 meV and an average hopping time of 100 µs [75, 76]. It is 
therefore not surprising that electron-hole pairs recombining with multiple eV of energy 
can provide enough energy to move lithium away from the laser spot. As will be shown 
in the next section, this optical coupling is not thermal, but is instead some form of 
energy transfer from the electron-hole pairs to the lithium ions. 
 
 
4.5 Optically Induced Resistance Changes 
 
 
The electrical properties of lithium niobite were explored to determine how the 
optical ion coupling might be used as an ionic optical sensor. Shown in Figure 4-10 is the 
resistance of a 1 mm long by 3 mm wide lithium niobite resistor when exposed to a broad 
spectrum ELH solar lamp. The resistance of the device increases when exposed to light 
with a delay of a few seconds. While traditional photoconductivity as the result of optical 
generation of electron-hole pairs would decrease the device resistance, the observed 
increase in resistance is the opposite of the photoconductivity effect and thus is not due to 
simple electron-hole pair generation.  Moreover, this change in resistance is also not a 
thermal effect because the resistivity of lithium niobite has been shown to decrease with 
increased temperature [90], a fact verified in this work by separate experiments using a 
thermal stage. 

 
106 
 
Figure 4-10: The resistance of a lithium niobite resistor when exposed to a broad spectrum solar 
lamp showing an increased resistance during exposure. 
 
 
The previously discussed similarities between the optically saturated and 
chemically deintercalated photoluminescence spectra suggest that light is capable of 
moving the loosely bound lithium ions in lithium niobite. Previous impedance 
measurements demonstrate that lithium motion increases the impedance of the material 
[21] and device simulations predict that lithium accumulation also increases the 
impedance by reducing the density of acceptors [87]. The observation of increased 
resistance when exposed to light is consistent with these previous observations in that 
increased lithium motion in the exposed area will accumulate lithium near the contacts 

 
107 
increasing the impedance.  Thus, this new light-matter interaction, photon induced ion 
motion, could be used as a biologically realistic artificial retina. 
 
4.6 Summary of Photoluminescence in Lithium Niobite 
 
 
Lithium niobite (LiNbO2) exhibits photoluminescence despite a high vacancy 
density that would normally be associated with non-radiative recombination. The 
photoluminescence spectrum is attributed to a band to band transition from a flat 
conduction band to a partially empty valence band as predicted by theoretical 
calculations. Photoluminescence measurements made on samples exposed to dilute HCl, 
which is known to remove lithium from lithium niobite, confirm that lithium vacancies 
modulate the Fermi level within the valence band. Sufficient removal of lithium 
completely removes the photoluminescence intensity supporting prior assertions that 
lithium niobite does transition from a direct to indirect band gap semiconductor as 
lithium is removed. 
In addition, optical coupling between a UV laser or a UV deficient solar lamp and 
the lithium ions locally depletes the lithium content resulting in photoluminescence 
spectra similar to the chemically deintercalated material. The band structure 
modifications and electrical changes induced by this optical coupling facilitate new 
opportunities in multi-functional sensor applications.

CHAPTER 5 
LITHIUM NIOBITE MEMRISTORS 
 
Lithium niobite memristors have been investigated for neuromorphic computing 
due to their memristive properties and their ionic physics, which is similar to the ionic 
physics encountered in biological neurons [74]. Two-terminal devices were fabricated by 
evaporating metal contacts onto sputter deposited lithium niobite films. Two device 
geometries were investigated as shown in Figure 5-1. The first geometry was an annular 
ring-dot pattern deposited onto a field of lithium niobite. The second geometry was a 
linear device in which the lithium niobite was deposited through a shadow mask to form 
an isolated line and the metal contacts were evaporated onto either end. The ring-dot 
geometry has previously been investigated for devices on both thin film MBE grown [21] 
and bulk LPEE growth lithium niobite [95]. 
 
 
Figure 5-1: Two geometries for lithium niobite memristors. (Left) an annular ring-dot pattern 
studied in previous work. (Right) a linear structure with isolated lithium niobite preventing any 
lithium from diffusing away from the device. 
 
 
 
The photolithography required to produce the ring-dot pattern proved difficult due 
to the tendency for sputtered lithium niobite to react with aqueous solutions. As discussed 

 
109 
in Chapter 2 and shown in Figure 2-20, Figure 2-21, and Figure 2-22 the sputter 
deposited material forms a layer of lithium oxide on top of the lithium niobite. This layer 
is water soluble and produces gaseous products when dissolved in aqueous solutions 
including the photoresist developer. Therefore, all films had to be pre-reacted with 
deionized water before photolithography could be attempted. 
 
Fabricated devices were tested to compare their behavior to previous lithium 
niobite memristors and to test the effect of contact metal on device performance. Previous 
work focused on contacts that block lithium motion such as Ti, Ni, and Cu [99]. This 
arrangement keeps all of the lithium inside the lithium niobite and allows the material to 
relax back to an equilibrium condition when the external voltage is removed resulting in a 
volatile memristor. However, other contact metals, such as Al and Au, are known to 
absorb and alloy with lithium [99]. By storing lithium outside the lithium niobite, non-
volatile memristors are explored. 
 
5.1 Volatile Lithium Niobite Memristors 
 
Previous volatile lithium niobite memristors have been characterized by current-
voltage curves [95], voltage step transient response [21], and by small signal impedance 
spectroscopy [74]. Lithium niobite memristors with lithium blocking contacts were 
fabricated in the ring-dot geometry using 300 nm of titanium, a lithium blocking material, 
and 100 nm of gold as a probe layer.  
As previously discussed in Chapter 2 and reproduced in Figure 5-2, two-terminal 
memristors made from sputter deposited lithium niobite exhibit the pinched hysteresis I-

 
110 
V curve of a memristor. In addition, the I-V curve rotates over the first few 
measurements before converging to a repeatable hysteresis loop. This effect where the 
first few cycles would be different than the steady state solution was theorized for mixed 
ion-electron conductors when the ions are free to move. 
 
Figure 5-2: The current-voltage curve of a sputter deposited lithium niobite device exhibiting 
memristive hysteresis and rotation characteristic of a mixed ion-electron conductor. 
 
Lithium niobite memristors were also tested with voltage steps in order to 
examine their transient response. The resistance was measured for voltage pulses at both 
±1V and ±5V while the “minimally biased” device resistance was measured at 0.1V. As 
shown in Figure 5-3, the device resistance decreases for both positive and negative 
voltage pulses. Examining the time constant for the resistance to saturate after a voltage 

 
111 
step, the 1/e point is at 1.47 seconds. However, the transient response is not a pure 
exponential as the 1/e2 point is at 10.18 seconds almost seven times the 1/e time rather 
than twice the 1/e time. These transient features are in agreement with past p-type volatile 
lithium niobite memristors that showed a decreasing resistance under bias and a non-
exponential resistance transient [21]. 
 
Figure 5-3: Resistance transients of a lithium niobite memristor with lithium blocking contacts 
causing a volatile device that relaxes back to the same resistance after each voltage pulse. The 
resistance transient during a voltage pulse has a non-exponential behavior. 
 
Lastly, the volatile lithium niobite memristor’s small signal response was 
measured under both unbiased and DC biased conditions. The small signal response was 
measured using a 10 mV signal and frequencies from 40 Hz to 10 MHz. As shown in 
Figure 5-4, the unbiased small signal response changes from a purely resistive load at low 

 
112 
frequencies to a mixed resistive-reactive load at high frequencies with a capacitive 
reactance. However, when the lithium niobite memristor was DC biased the low 
frequency impedance gained a positive reactance indicative of inductive behavior. These 
features are in agreement with past volatile lithium niobite memristors [74]. 
 
 
Figure 5-4: Small signal impedance of a sputter deposited lithium niobite memristor. With no DC 
bias the memristor is purely resistive at low frequencies and gains a capacitive reactance at high 
frequencies. Under DC bias the memristor gains a low frequency inductive reactance. 
 
Examining the frequency response of the “inductive” behavior, shown in Figure 
5-5, the reactance decays with frequency rather than increasing with frequency like a 
typical inductor (i.e. X = jwL). Therefore, the “inductive” reactance can be better 
approximated as a negative capacitance. The existence of low frequency positive 

 
113 
reactance has been previously observed in systems with stored energy such as batteries 
[147], electric double layers [148], and quantum well photodetectors [149]. It is therefore 
not unreasonable to find negative capacitance in lithium niobite memristors under bias 
when a lithium ion gradient is induced storing energy in the chemical gradient. In 
addition, an anomalous inductive behavior has been observed in biological neurons, 
which possess a bias due to an ion gradient [150]. It is possible that this anomalous 
inductance is actually an ionic negative capacitance as observed in LiNbO2. 
 
 
 
Figure 5-5: The low frequency inductive reactance observed in a lithium niobite memristor under 
bias. The reactance decreases with frequency rather than increasing as would be expected for an 
inductor (X = jωL). The positive reactance that decreases with frequency can be described by a 
negative capacitance. 
 
 

 
114 
It has been previously noted that capacitance originating from a diffusive physical 
phenomena obeys a reduced power law behavior of the form shown in Equation 5.1 
[151]. 
 ( )  (  )        
Equation 5.1 
 
The positive reactance observed in lithium niobite memristors also obeys a 
reduced power law, as shown by the fit in Figure 5-5, further suggesting that the positive 
reactance may be caused by the lithium ion gradient under bias and the diffusion of the 
ions under low frequency conditions. However, for most diffusive phenomenon the 
fitting exponent is much less than 1 (n << 1), whereas the fitting exponent for lithium 
niobite is only slightly less than 1 (n = 0.9987). 
 
5.2 Non-Volatile Lithium Niobite Memristors 
Two terminal memristors were manufactured on sputter deposited lithium niobite 
in the line geometry with one lithium blocking contact composed of titanium-gold, 
similar to the volatile device contacts, and the other contact composed of lithium 
absorbing aluminum. The line geometry was utilized in order to confine the lithium to the 
device and eliminate any effects due to lithium diffusing into the device from the 
surrounding material. The device resistance was measured with an oscillating ±0.1V 
sense signal and the memristors were programmed using positive and negative pulses. As 
shown in Figure 5-6, when voltage pulses of alternating polarity were applied, the device 
resistance alternated between two resistance ranges. However, when successive pulses of 
the same polarity were applied, the device resistance incrementally decreased indicating 
that the resistance change is an analog process rather than a discrete state change. 

 
115 
 
Figure 5-6: Resistance transients of a lithium niobite memristor with one lithium absorbing 
aluminum contact. The ability to absorb lithium out of the lithium niobite creates non-volatile 
resistance changes that are both analog and reversible. 
 
In order to verify that the lithium absorbing aluminum contact is responsible for 
the programmable resistance, an identical device was made with two lithium blocking 
titanium contacts. As shown in Figure 5-7, the device with two lithium blocking contacts 
did not possess multiple resistance states and tended to relax back toward the same 
resistance value during the sense signal. 

 
116 
 
Figure 5-7: Resistance transients of a lithium niobite memristor identical to the device measured in 
Figure 5-6 except that the lithium absorbing aluminum contact was replaced with a lithium blocking 
contact. The single contact change both eliminates the non-volatile resistance changes and lowers the 
resistance by a factor of 20. 
 
 
Examining the non-volatile device data in Figure 5-6, positive polarity pulses 
cause the resistance to increase while negative polarity pulse cause the resistance to 
decrease. However, positive polarity pulses should drive lithium into the aluminum 
electrode, decreasing the amount of lithium in the lithium niobite, and decreasing the 
device resistance. Therefore, while the lithium absorbing aluminum contacts do induce 
non-volatile behavior, the resistance change is not likely due to changes in the lithium 
content of the lithium niobite layer. 

 
117 
Further, the non-volatile device measured in Figure 5-6 and the volatile device 
measured in Figure 5-7 were identical except for their contacts. By exchanging a titanium 
contact for an aluminum contact the total device resistance was increased by a factor of 
20. It order to examine the effects of lithium absorbing aluminum contacts while 
minimizing any changes to the lithium content of the lithium niobite layer, device were 
fabricated on > 100 um thick bulk grown lithium niobite. A volatile device was fabricated 
using lithium blocking copper contacts. As shown in Figure 5-8, this device exhibits 
memristive hysteresis with the device resistance between 8 – 18 Ω. A non-volatile device 
was fabricated with one lithium blocking titanium contact and one lithium absorbing 
aluminum contact. As shown in Figure 5-8, the non-volatile device is significantly more 
resistive than the volatile device. In addition, the non-volatile device still exhibits a 
programmable resistance where positive voltage pulses increase the device resistance and 
negative voltage pulses decrease the device resistance. For this device on bulk lithium 
niobite, any lithium absorbed into the contacts (≈300 nm thick) should have a minimal 
effect on the lithium content of the bulk lithium niobite (≈100 um thick). 
 
Figure 5-8: (Left) Current-voltage curve from a volatile memristor fabricated on bulk lithium niobite 
with a resistance range of 8 – 18 ohms. (Right) Resistance transients from a non-volatile memristor 
fabricated on bulk lithium niobite with a resistance range of 2.5 – 3.3 kohms. 

 
118 
 
 
By plotting the non-volatile device’s resistance change as a function of pulse 
voltage, shown in Figure 5-9, it is apparent that the resistance change is non-linear with 
pulse voltage where the resistance change is larger at high voltages than would be 
expected from a linear extrapolation. This non-linear programming creates opportunities 
for non-volatile lithium niobite memristors to replicate the learning functionality of 
biological synapses in a neuromorphic circuit. 
 
Figure 5-9: The change in resistance of a non-volatile lithium niobite memristor as a function of 
applied voltage pulse. 
 
One form of learning within biological neurons is a process called spike timing 
dependent plasticity (STDP). In STDP, the strength of a synaptic connection is changed 

 
119 
based on the relative timing of the pre-synaptic action potential and the post-synaptic 
action potential as shown in Figure 5-10. If the pre-synaptic action potential arrives at the 
synapse immediately prior to the post-synaptic action potential, then activity at that 
synapse is a good predictor of the post-syanptic neuron’s activity and the synaptic 
connection is strengthened. If the pre-synaptic action potential arrives at the synapse 
immediately after the post-synaptic action potential, then activity at that synapse is a poor 
predictor of the post-syanptic neuron’s activity and the synaptic connection is weakened. 
 
 
Figure 5-10: Description of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in which the relative timing of 
action potentials arriving at a synapse determines the change in synaptic conduction. 
 
In memristive neuromorphic circuitry, STDP has been implemented by noting 
that action potentials contain both positive and negative voltages as shown in Figure 
5-11. Therefore, if two action potentials arrive at a memristor from opposite sides, the 
voltage across the memristor will be a function of their relative arrival times. 

 
120 
 
Figure 5-11: (Left) Typical action potentials recorded from biological neurons. (Right) The 
magnitude of the resultant voltage pulse when two action potentials arrive at a biological synapse at 
times offset from one another. 
 
The non-linear resistance changes observed in the non-volatile lithium niobite 
memristor, shown in Figure 5-9, can be roughly fit to a cubic function as shown in Figure 
5-12a. By combining the expected voltage difference across the memristor as a function 
of action potential arrival times and the resistance change as a function of pulse voltage, 
the resistance change as a function of action potential arrival time can be calculated. The 
calculated response of a non-volatile lithium niobite synapse, shown in Figure 5-12b, 
exhibits STDP where a small positive arrival time offset significantly increases the 
resistance while a small negative arrival time offset significantly decreases the resistance. 
If the arrival time offset is large in either direction, then only small changes are made to 
the memristor resistance. 

 
121

calculated resistance change as a function of action potential offset timing displaying the 
characteristic behavior of STDP. 
 
In summary, both volatile and non-volatile memristors have been fabricated on 
sputter deposited thin film LiNbO2 as well as on bulk grown LiNbO2. These devices 
exhibit memristive hysteresis useful for replicating the biological functionality of 
synapses, dendrites, and axons in neuromorphic circuit applications. Lithium niobite 
memristors also exhibit the low frequency inductive behavior observed in biological 
neurons [150]. The programming of non-volatile lithium niobite memristors exhibits non-
linear behavior mimicking the STDP learning behavior in biological synapses.

CHAPTER 6 
THIN FILM LITHIUM NIOBITE BATTERIES 
 
In addition to two terminal lithium niobite memristors, useful for replicating 
biological functionality in the synapses, dendrites, and axon, lithium niobite based 
batteries are potentially applicable to neuromorphic computing in order to replicate the 
ionic integration that occurs in the soma in which ion transport across an insulating layer 
creates a chemical potential. Likewise, ion transport across a battery’s insulating 
electrolyte creates a chemical potential that can drive a neuromorphic circuit. For 
application as a neuromorphic soma, a thin film battery must be able to cycle repeatedly 
and have low resistive losses. 
 
6.1 Background and Theory 
 
The first application explored for lithium niobite was as a battery cathode using 
powdered material [90, 94]. Lithium niobite shares the layered structure of other battery 
cathode materials that enables the intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions. Early 
lithium niobite batteries used powdered material for the lithium niobite cathode, a liquid 
electrolyte, and lithium metal anodes. This early work reported open circuit voltages 
between 2.4 – 2.8 V vs a reference Li anode [90, 94]. 
 
One potential advantage of lithium niobite compared to the more common battery 
cathode material LiCoO2 is a significantly lower resistance. LiCoO2 is an insulating oxide 
with a room temperature resistivity of approximately 1011 Ω-cm [100]. In contrast, 
lithium niobite is a metallic oxide with a room temperature resistivity of approximately 
10-5 Ω-cm [88]. This 16 order of magnitude difference in resistivity creates electrical 

 
123 
losses in LiCoO2 as electrons need to travel through the cathode to neutralize the 
intercalated lithium ions. Bulk LiCoO2 batteries overcome this limitation by mixing the 
LiCoO2 powder with conductive carbon, a procedure not easily accomplished in thin film 
batteries. The inclusion of carbon in the battery lowers the active volume density of the 
cathode reducing both the theoretical and practically achieved capacity.  
 
While lithium niobite is more conductive than LiCoO2, it has a lower open-circuit 
voltage (VLiNbO2 = 2.4 – 2.8 V, VLiCoO2 = 3 – 4.2 V) and a lower theoretical fully dense 
charge capacity (CLiNbO2 = 200 mAh/g, CLiCoO2 = 272 mAh/g) [152] than LiCoO2. Due to 
the need for graphite additives to achieve conduction and the inability to use the entire 
volume in a thin film, the practically achievable bulk LiCoO2/graphite and thin film 
LiCoO2 capacities are approximately 160 mAh/g [153] and 80 mAh/g [154] respectively.  
The theoretical charge capacity CLiNbO2 can be calculated by Equation 6.1. 
  
     
        
Equation 6.1 
           
     
    
              
    
   
                     
  
    
            
  
where q is the charge of an electron, #Li is the number of lithium atoms per unit cell, V is 
the volume of the unit cell, and ρ is the material’s density. While a lower voltage and 
charge capacity does reduce the energy density of the battery, impeding its use as a 
primary power source, a high energy density is not required for neuromorphic 
applications where the battery will be cycled through only a small fraction of its potential 
capacity. As shown in Figure 6-1, the region over which ionic integration occurs is much 
smaller than the voltage plateau where the battery accumulates charge.  
 

 
124 
 
Figure 6-1: Open-circuit voltage of a thin film lithium niobite battery from this work during 
charging. The voltage increases during the first portion of the charge cycle before stabilizing. Ionic 
integration useful for neuromorhic computing only occurs during a small percentage of the total 
charge cycle. 
 
6.2 Battery Fabrication 
 
 
No thin film lithium niobite battery has ever been reported. Therefore, fabrication 
was guided by prior efforts on thin film LiCoO2 batteries [154-156].  These thin film 
batteries each consisted of four layers: 1) a metallic current collector, 2) a sputter 
deposited LiCoO2 cathode, 3) a sputter deposited LiPON electrolyte, and 4) a metallic 
anode. Several different metallic anodes have been attempted. Evaporated lithium metal 
has been used as an anode [155], but metallic lithium is very reactive and generally 
avoided due to safety concerns [157]. Aluminum has been used as an anode material due 

 
125 
to its ability to intercalate lithium [156]. Aluminum has a theoretical capacity between 
993 mAh/g for LiAl and 2234 mAh/g for Al4Li9 [129] which is 2 – 6 times the capacity 
of graphitic carbon used in bulk lithium ion batteries [131]. Finally, nickel has been used 
as a lithium blocking anode where lithium metal is electroplated under the nickel after the 
battery has been formed [154]. 
Lithium niobite batteries were fabricated using these same procedures as shown in 
Figure 6-2. A titanium/nickel current collecting layer was evaporated onto a sapphire 
substrate. The lithium niobite cathode was then sputter deposited through a shadow mask 
to define the battery area. The LiPON electrolyte was sputter deposited onto the lithium 
niobite cathode. A larger area shadow mask was used to define the LiPON area in order 
to ensure no edge effects would short the thin film batteries. Lastly, a metallic anode was 
evaporated onto the LiPON through a shadow mask with the same dimensions as the 
original lithium niobite deposition. Both lithium absorbing aluminum and lithium 
blocking nickel anodes were investigated.

6.3 Experimental Results 

 
126 
6.3.1 Electrical Performance 
Thin film lithium niobite batteries with lithium blocking nickel anodes were 
capable of cycling repeatedly. As shown in Figure 6-3, the cell could be charged to a 
voltage of 3 V and discharged. The discharge plateau was measured between 1.5 – 2.5 V, 
substantially lower than the open circuit voltages for bulk lithium niobite batteries using 
metallic lithium anodes, VOC = 2.4 – 2.8 V. Since the chemical potential of nickel (-0.25 
vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) is less negative than the chemical potential of 
lithium (-3.05 vs. SHE), the lower cell voltages may be due to a combined nickel/lithium 
anode. 
 
Figure 6-3: Measured open-circuit voltages of a nickel anode battery during a charge and discharge 
cycle. The charge cycle does not contain a voltage plateau as the battery is being operated within the 
ionic integration regime of Figure 6-1. During discharge the battery has an operation voltage 
between 1.5-2.5 V. 

 
127 
 
 
The nickel anode battery was cycled 100 times in order to determine its long term 
stability. As shown in Figure 6-4, the discharge capacity decreased over the first few 
cycles before stabilizing at 1.3 mAh/g, approximately 35% of the first cycle capacity. 
This is similar to thin film batteries made with LiCoO2 that show a stable capacity 
between 20 – 30% of their first cycle capacity [154]. The observed capacity fade in thin 
film batteries is likely due to irreversible reactions during the first few cycles that 
condition the battery anode. 
 
Figure 6-4: (Left) Open-circuit voltages during the first ten discharge cycles showing a decreasing 
capacity but a stable operating voltage. (Right) The battery’s specific capacity over the first 100 
cycles stabilizes at 1.3 mAh/g. 
 
Attempts to make a thin film battery using lithium absorbing aluminum anodes 
were unsuccessful. As shown in Figure 6-5, the battery initially charged starting at a cell 
voltage of approximately 1.5 V and increasing toward 3 V. However, for cell voltages 
above 2 V, the cell resistance increased with stored charge requiring a higher over-
potential to maintain the 10 µA/cm2 charging current density. After storing 
approximately 60 mAh/g, ~30% of the theoretical capacity, the cell failed and no longer 

 
128 
supported a voltage. The increase in cell resistance could have been caused by two 
effects. First, as observed in Chapter 5 intercalating lithium into an aluminum contact 
significantly increased the device resistance of a two terminal memristor and could have 
increased the resistance of the aluminum anode battery. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 
6-5, the aluminum anode delaminated effectively reducing the battery area. This 
delamination is likely due to stress from the volumetric expansion of aluminum which 
doubles in volume when intercalated with lithium [129].   
 
Figure 6-5: (Left) Open-cell voltage of a thin film lithium niobite battery with a lithium absorbing 
aluminum anode. During charging the cell overpotential necessary to drive a constant current (i.e. 
the cell resistance) increases dramatically. (Right) The aluminum anode battery after charging 
showing the anode has delaminated from the underlying battery structure. 
 
 
One objective of using lithium niobite as the battery cathode is to reduce the cell 
resistance and enable fast charge-discharge batteries. In general, charge transport within a 
battery is determined by the ionic and electronic conductivities of the anode, cathode, 
electrolyte, and interfaces each of which can be further divided into conduction 
mechanisms such as drift, diffusion, trap assisted conductivity, percolation conductivity, 
etc. [158]. In a simplified model, as shown in Figure 6-6, there are five charge transport 
processes that contribute to the resistance of a battery. 

 
129 
 
 
Figure 6-6: (Left) Schematic diagram of the charge transport processes in a thin film battery. (Right) 
Measured conductivities (see paragraphs below) for each of the five charge transport processes. 
 
Charge transport within a battery can be simplified to 1) ion conduction in the 
cathode, 2) electron conduction in the cathode, 3) ion conduction through the electrolyte, 
4) ion conduction in the anode, and 5) electron conduction in the anode. In order to 
determine the rate limiting ion conductivity, each of the above layer conductivities was 
measured. In thin film batteries based on LiCoO2, the low electron conductivity of 
LiCoO2 is the limiting conduction mechanism. However, examining the conductivities 
for each of the charge transport mechanisms in a lithium niobite battery, shown in Figure 
6-6, the limiting conductivity is ion conduction through the LiPON electrolyte. It should 
be noted that with a lithium blocking nickel electrode lithium does not move through the 
anode and instead electroplates a layer of lithium under the anode. 
6.3.2 Ion Conductivity Measurements 
The ion conductivities shown in Figure 6-6 are calculated from frequency 
dependent measurements termed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using 
Equation 6.2 [159]. 
     
  
  
Equation 6.2 

 
130 
Where fi is the ion relaxation frequency determined from the minimum in the 
reactance of an EIS spectrum, σi is the ion conductivity, and ϵ is the low frequency 
dielectric constant. Example EIS spectra are shown in Figure 6-7 for both the sputtered 
lithium niobite cathode and the LiPON electrolyte. The ion relaxation frequency in 
lithium niobite is approximately 50 times higher than the ion relaxation frequency in 
LiPON, although LiPON also has a high dielectric constant (ϵr = 16.6) [160] leading to a 
smaller difference in the calculated ion conductivities. While the dielectric constant of 
lithium niobite is unknown, a value of ϵr = 1 was assumed do to the high electron 
conductivity of lithium niobite and its metallic nature. 
 
Figure 6-7: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy spectra for both the lithium niobite cathode 
and the LiPON electrolyte showing a significantly higher ion relaxation frequency in the lithium 
niobite. 
 
 
In order to further improve the conductivity of thin film lithium niobite batteries, 
the ion conductivities of the electrolyte and the lithium niobite cathode should be 
improved. The ion relaxation frequency in lithium niobite grown by molecular beam 
epitaxy (MBE) is greater than 108 Hz corresponding to an ion conductivity greater than 6 

 
131 
x 10-5 S/cm. The higher ion conductivity in MBE grown material is likely due to its 
higher crystal quality. 
Thin films of LiPON with slightly higher ion conductivities (3.3 x 10-6 S/cm) 
have been demonstrated [161]. It was theorized that the ion conductivity in LiPON was 
enabled by a cross-linked N-3P structure. The LiPON film with the highest reported 
conductivity had approximately 20% of the nitrogen in this cross-linked N-3P structure as 
measured by XPS [161]. As shown in Figure 6-8, XPS of the LiPON films used in this 
work shows three distinct binding energies for nitrogen along with their reported 
structures. As with the highest reported conductivity LiPON films, in these films the N-
3P structure, shown in green, composes 20.8 ± 1.9 % of the nitrogen signal.  
 
Figure 6-8: Measured N1s XPS spectrum for the sputter deposited LiPON electrolyte. Approximately 
20% of the nitrogen signal is associated with the N-3P structure that enables lithium ion conduction. 

 
132 
 
An alternative method to limit the impact of the low ion conductivity in LiPON is 
to reduce the thickness of the electrolyte layer thus reducing its resistance. However, one 
of the common failure modes in lithium ion batteries is the formation of metallic lithium 
dendrites across the electrolyte that short out the battery. Thin films (approximately 1 µm 
thick) of LiPON have been shown to passivate such dendrite formation [162]. However, 
thin film lithium niobite batteries fabricated with LiPON thicknesses less than 1 µm 
resulted in rapid performance deterioration and the formation of a short circuit. Cross 
sectional SEM, shown in Figure 6-9, confirms the existence of a dendritic structure 
bridging the battery anode and cathode. 
 
Figure 6-9: Cross sectional SEM of a thin film lithium niobite battery with a thin LiPON electrolyte 
layer showing the formation of a lithium dendrite bridging the anode and cathode. 

 
133 
 
Therefore, in order to improve the conductivity of the lithium niobite battery 
either the LiPON electrolyte must be improved past previously reported record 
conductivities or a different solid electrolyte must be used. Multiple solid electrolytes 
with high ion conductivity have been reported. Li0.34La0.51TiO2.94 has a reported ion 
conductivity of almost 10-4 S/cm, but reacts with lithium metal becoming electrically 
conductive ruining its ability to act as a battery electrolyte [163]. Likewise, Li7La3Zr2O12 
has a reported ion conductivity of approximately 10-4 S/cm, but only in crystalline form 
requiring high temperature processing [164]. When processed at low temperatures, Li-La-
Zr-O is amorphous with an ion conductivity of approximately 10-7 S/cm. 
In summary, solid-state batteries using lithium niobite as the cathode were 
demonstrated. Batteries fabricated with a lithium absorbing aluminum anode failed due to 
volumetric expansion of the aluminum. However, batteries fabricated with a lithium 
blocking nickel anode were successfully cycled. Cycling the batteries to 3V over 100 
cycles caused a decrease in specific energy capacity that stabilized at 1.3 mAh/g. The 
batteries were operated over a small range of potential capacity in which ionic integration 
occurs useful for replicating the ionic integration of a biological neuron. By using 
electrically conductive lithium niobite as the cathode material the limiting conductivity 
mechanism became ion conduction through the solid electrolyte. Further improvements 
to the battery conductivity will require improving the solid electrolyte layer.

CHAPTER 7 
ANOMOLOUS RECTIFICATION AND HYSTERESIS IN NIOBIUM 
PENTOXIDE CAPACITORS 
 
7.1 Literature Survey 
 
 
In 1962, a neuristor circuit was theorized for propagating signals without 
attenuation as is observed between biological neurons [165].  In 2013, a NbO2 memristor 
was demonstrated that replicates the voltage triggered switching behavior observed in 
biological ion channels enabling a physical neuristor circuit to be built [23]. These NbO2 
memristors replicate the rectification observed in voltage-gated biological ion channels 
[166] as well as the hysteresis necessary for the proposed neuristor circuit to operate [23]. 
However, the NbO2 memristors are manufactured by electroforming an insulating layer 
of Nb2O5 into the semiconductor NbO2, a process that introduces challenges for scaling to 
dense circuits. Additionally, previous work has not reported a capacitance in NbO2 
memristors requiring an additional parallel capacitance for the neuristor circuit to operate 
[23]. Herein, an Nb2O5-x based metal-insulator-metal (MIM) device is investigated that 
does not require electroforming, possesses a dispersive capacitance advantageous for 
neuromorphic circuits, and exhibits the rectification and hysteresis necessary to replicate 
ion channel functionality for the neuristor circuit.  
Niobium Pentoxide (Nb2O5) has been studied as an insulating layer in MIM 
diodes since at least the 1960’s [167]. These early studies on Nb – Anodized Nb2O5 – Au 
devices found rectification [167] and a Poole-Frenkel conduction mechanism [168]. The 

 
135 
defect state enabling Poole-Frenkel conduction was found to lie between 0.22 – 1.2 eV 
[167, 168] below the conduction band edge likely due to oxygen vacancies [168]. 
Additionally, it was found that upon dielectric breakdown these devices exhibited 
bistable switching in small conducting regions similar to the NbO2 devices used in the 
2013 neuristor demonstration [169].  There is debate in the literature regarding the 
operating mechanism of the electroformed NbO2 devices with both a Mott Metal-
Insulator transition [23] and a Joule heat driven Poole-Frenkel mechanism [170] 
suggested. 
 
7.2 Niobium Pentoxide Characterization 
 
 
MIM diodes were produced on sapphire substrates in three steps. First, a ground 
plane consisting of a 50 nm titanium adhesion layer and 300 nm of metal (Cu, Au, Ni, or 
Pt) was deposited by electron beam evaporation across the entire chip. Next, a layer of 
niobium oxide was deposited through a shadow mask by room temperature reactive 
sputtering. Finally, 300 nm thick top metal contacts were deposited through a second 
shadow mask using electron beam evaporation. 
 
The niobium oxide insulating layer was sputter deposited at room temperature 
using a reactive deposition process. A metallic niobium target was sputtered in a mixed 
Ar/O2 environment using gas flows of 35 sccm and 15 sccm respectively. The chamber 
pressure was maintained at 10 mTorr. The niobium target was energized with 4.8 
WDC/cm2 producing a deposition rate of 5 angstroms per minute. It was previously shown 
that even low temperature annealing impacts the structural and electrical properties of 

 
136 
Nb2O5 [171]. Thus, the low power deposition allowed precise control of the oxide 
thickness and minimized unintentional heating of the devices. 
The niobium oxide explored herein was sputter deposited at room-temperature 
and was characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray reflectivity (XRR), optical 
transmission spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in 
Figure 7-1. Symmetric XRD measurements revealed no peaks except for the sapphire 
substrate indicating the deposited niobium oxide is amorphous. The density of the 
deposited niobium oxide was determined by XRR to be 4.1 +/- 0.1 g/cm3
, significantly 
lower than the ideal density of 4.55 g/cm3 for Nb2O5 consistent with approximately 8 - 
12% oxygen deficiency [172]. Applying the Tauc method to the optical absorption 
spectra revealed an optical band gap of 3.15 ± 0.004 eV, slightly lower than the reported 
range of band gaps from 3.2 – 4 eV [173]. This matches previous reports of a lower band 
gap for low density Nb2O5 [171]. Lastly, the oxygen to niobium ratio, as measured by 
XPS, was 2.30 ± 0.02, approximately 7 - 9% lower than the ideal ratio of 2.5. This 
indicates that the niobium oxide layer is oxygen deficient and that there may be a high 
density of oxygen vacancies. The niobium XPS spectrum indicates a single Nb5+ 
oxidation state with no detectible NbO2 present. 

 
137 
 
Figure 7-1: a) Symmetric XRD exhibits no peaks other than the sapphire substrate (*) indicating that

Fabricated MIM diodes were electrically tested to determine their steady state 
current-voltage relation, frequency dependent impedance, and capacitance both with and 
without bias. Steady state measurements were performed using a Keithley 6517A 
Electrometer. Frequency dependent measurements were performed using an Agilent 
4294A Precision Impedance Analyzer over a frequency range from 40 Hz – 10 MHz. 
 
7.3 Anomalous Rectification and Hysteresis 
 

 
138 
The current-voltage characteristics for a Metal-Nb2O5-x-Metal diode exhibit 
rectification and hysteresis, as shown in Figure 7-2a. This measurement was performed 
using 50 mV steps and holding for 15 seconds at each voltage step. At each voltage step 
the current transient was measured and is shown in Figure 7-2b. For voltages below turn-
on, the current decreases as a function of time in a nearly exponential fashion. For 
voltages above turn-on, the current increases with time. As shown in Figure 7-2c, the 
current transients above turn-on have not saturated to a steady state current after 150 
seconds indicating that a slow phenomenon is responsible for the current transient. The 
hysteresis present in the current-voltage curves may therefore be due to the slow 
timeframe for reaching a steady state current allowing a broad range of frequencies for 
neuromorphic device operation (i.e. f  > 1/150 Hz). The combination of rectification and 
memristive hysteresis led to the term memdiode consistent with previous devices that 
exhibit these features [174].

hysteresis. b) Current transients at several voltage steps in (a) normalized to the first data point 
showing a decreasing current below the turn-on voltage of 1 volt and increasing current above the 
turn-on voltage. c) An extended current transient above the turn-on voltage showing that the time 
scale to reach steady state is hundreds of seconds. 
 
In addition to rectification and hysteresis, it is desirable for the memristors in the 
neuristor circuit to exhibit capacitance. This eliminates the need for an external parallel 

 
139 
capacitor, enabling higher density circuits. Measurements of various sized Nb2O5-x MIM 
diode’s capacitance indicate the relative dielectric constant εr is 37.1 ± 1.0 at 1 MHz. As 
shown in Figure 7-3a, the memdiode capacitance is dependent on frequency and the 
capacitance at biological frequencies (< 100 Hz) is significantly higher (εr > 180) than the 
capacitance at 1 MHz. This allows the memdiode to be scaled to nanometer sizes without 
large external capacitors in the neuristor circuit. 
 
Figure 7-3: a) The capacitance and conductance as a function of frequency. The capacitance is highly 
dependent on frequency with a relative dielectric constant greater than 180 at neurological 
frequencies (< 100 Hz). b) The capacitance and conductance as a function of DC bias voltage 
measured at 100 Hz. The capacitance is relatively unchanging below the turn-on voltage, increasing 
by only 6%. The slight increase in capacitance is likely due to image-force lowering decreasing the 
effective insulator thickness. Above the turn-on voltage the capacitance decreases and the 
conductance exhibits rectification. 
 
As shown in Figure 7-3b, the bias dependent capacitance and conductance of the 
memdiodes shows that, unlike a traditional p-n junction diode, the capacitance increases 
slightly for voltages below the turn on voltage and decreases above the turn on voltage. 
The device conductance exhibits rectification similar to the quasi-steady state 
measurements shown in Figure 7-2a. The memdiode therefore maintains the ability to 
store charge under bias, particularly above turn-on, which is necessary for the neuristor 
circuit to operate. 

 
140 
Devices of similar thickness were fabricated with Cu, Au, Ni, and Pt contacts in 
order to investigate the effects of the metal work function on device performance. As 
shown in Figure 7-4a, each device exhibited a transition between a high resistance region 
and a low resistance region when plotted on a semi-log plot. This transition voltage scales 
linearly with the ideal metal work function [175], as shown in Figure 7-4b, indicating that 
the transition is associated with the metal-Nb2O5-x Schottky barrier height. In addition, 
the electron affinity of amorphous Nb2O5 is determined to be 4.50 +/- 0.07 eV by 
extrapolating the ideal work function to zero transition voltage. 
 
Figure 7-4: a) Semi-log plot of the current-voltage sweep defining a transition voltage between the off 
and on states. b) The transition voltage is linearly proportional to the ideal metal work function 
indicating that the transition is tied to the Schottky barrier height. c) The transition voltage is 
logarithmically related to the oxide thickness in contrast to traditional MIM diodes. 
 
Devices were also fabricated with a range of Nb2O5-x thicknesses ranging between 
10 – 300 nm. As shown in Figure 7-4c, the transition voltage scales as the logarithm of 
thickness with thicker devices requiring a larger voltage to transition to the conducting 
state. This contrasts with a traditional MIM diode based on Fowler-Nordheim tunneling 
for which the turn-on voltage scales nearly linearly with thickness making thick devices 
impractical. 
 

 
141 
7.4 Theoretical Explanation 
 
Rectification in MIM diodes is typically associated with a transition in current 
mechanism from thermionic emission in the off state to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling in 
the on state [145]. However, this interpretation should lead to a turn-on voltage nearly 
linear dependent on the thickness and weakly dependent on the metal-insulator Schottky 
barrier height. However, the devices discussed herein exhibit rectification at lower 
voltages more consistent with the expected Schottky barrier heights for the metal-Nb2O5 
junction and possess turn on voltages logarithmically dependent on thickness. This can be 
explained by considering charge transport via the defect states of the Nb2O5-x layer and 
by considering two separate regions within the Nb2O5-x layer. As shown in Figure 7-5, 
when the defect states in Region 1 are empty a fixed positive charge and an enhanced 
electric field result compared to Region 2 where the defects are occupied and thus 
neutral. This spatially varied charge occupation results in two distinct conduction states. 
Under low voltage conditions, shown in Figure 7-5a, the supply of electrons into 
Region 1 is governed by thermionic emission over a Schottky barrier which limits overall 
current flow. These injected electrons are swept into Region 2 where they propagate via 
the Poole-Frenkel mechanism. With each successive voltage increment, the electric field 
within Region 2 momentarily drives a Poole-Frenkel current larger than the thermionic 
current depleting electrons from the edge of Region 1. This depletion of electrons leaves 
behind additional positively charged defects, widening Region 1which supports a larger 
proportion of the applied voltage. This conversely reduces the electric field within 
Region 2 and thus reduces the Poole-Frenkel current to balance the available thermionic 
current in the steady-state. 

 
142 
After sufficient voltage is applied to reach the device turn on, shown in Figure 
7-5b, tunneling across the charged Region 1 can occur from the metal electrode directly 
into Region 2. For niobium oxide with a sufficient number of defects, the electric field in 
Region 1 is dominated by the amount of ionized charge in Region 1 causing the turn-on 
voltage to be controlled by the Schottky barrier height rather than the device thickness as 
is experimentally observed in Figure 7-4. As the voltage is increased beyond the turn-on 
voltage, an increase in the electric field in Region 2 results in an increase in the Poole-
Frenkel current. Thus, the Poole-Frenkel current dominates the current flow and dictates 
the injected tunneling current through control of the width of Region 1 by the emptying 
(or filling) of defects at the interface between the two regions. 
 
Figure 7-5: The charge density and electron potential of the proposed device model both a) below 
and b) above the turn-on voltage. Removal of electrons from traps in Region 1 leaves fixed positive 
charge that supports a large electric field (106 V/cm). The steady state width of Region 1 is 
determined by balancing the injection of electrons by thermionic emission below the turn-on voltage 
or tunneling current above the turn-on voltage with the removal of electrons by Poole-Frenkel 
current through Region 2. a) Below the turn-on voltage a small electric field (103 V/cm) is required in 
Region 2 to remove the electrons injected by thermionic emission. b) Above the turn-on voltage a 
larger electric field (105 V/cm) is required in Region 2 to remove electrons injected by tunneling. 
 
This proposed model for these metal-Nb2O5-x-metal memdiodes predicts that for 
voltages below turn-on the conduction will be controlled by the Schottky barrier height 

 
143 
and the associated thermionic current. Above the turn-on voltage, current will be limited 
by the Poole-Frenkel current described by Equation 7.1. 
            ( 
 
   (   √
  
  ))  
Equation 7.1 
where µ is the electron mobility, No is the concentration of defects, E is the electric field, 
ϕD is the defect trap energy, and ε is the high frequency dielectric constant [145]. 
Based on Equation 7.1, plotting the logarithm of current divided by the electric 
field, ln(I/E), vs the square root of the electric field will reveal any Poole-Frenkel 
controlled voltage regimes as a linear region. As shown in Figure 7-6, for voltages above 
a threshold value there is a linear regime confirming the Poole-Frenkel current 
mechanism controls conduction at high voltages. 

 
144 
 
Figure 7-6: A Poole-Frenkel plot exhibiting a linear region above the turn-on voltage indicating that 
the Poole-Frenkel mechanism controls the current flow within this voltage range. The coefficient of 
determination (R2) is 0.998 indicating good agreement between the experimental measurements and 
the linear fit. 
 
To determine the trap energy, temperature dependent conductivity measurements 
were performed at DC biases above the turn-on voltage where the device was shown to 
be controlled by the Poole-Frenkel current. As shown in Figure 7-7a, measured at 1.25 V, 
the temperature dependent current exhibits rectification. The rectification is caused by the 
supply of electrons transitioning from a tunneling current mechanism at low temperature 
to thermionic emission current at high temperatures. By fitting ln(I/T2) for the thermionic 
current at high temperatures and ln(I) for the Poole-Frenkel current, which controls the 
tunneling current as previously shown, at low temperatures, the Schottky barrier height 

 
145 
and the Poole-Frenkel trap depth can be determined. The Schottky barrier height was 
determined for the thickest device in Figure 7-4c, 280 nm, to be 0.96 ± 0.08 eV 
comparable to the theoretical barrier height for Pt/Nb2O5 of 1.0 eV, but slightly lower 
than the measured turn-on voltage for this device of 1.12 V. The higher experimental 
turn-on voltage is likely due to an additional small voltage drop over Region 2 in thicker 
devices as shown in Figure 7-4c. A less likely explanation for the temperature 
rectification observed in Figure 7-7a is activation of a deep defect state that contributes to 
the Poole-Frenkel current. Fitting the high temperature activation energy of the Poole-
Frenkel Arrhenius plot yields a defect energy of 1.0 eV slightly lower than the 1.1 eV 
energy for the second ionization of an oxygen vacancy in Nb2O5 [168]. However, 
emission from such a deep defect is extremely slow, resulting in a negligible contribution 
to current. Thus, it is assumed that the observed temperature rectification is due to a 
transition from a shallow defect Poole-Frenkel current at low temperatures to thermionic 
emission over the Schottky barrier at high temperatures. 
As shown in Equation 7.1, the Poole-Frenkel trap energy is modified by an 
electric field term that must be fit by measuring the temperature dependent current at 
multiple electric fields. As shown in Figure 7-7b, fitting the measured Poole-Frenkel 
activation energies yields a defect depth of 0.22 ± 0.01 eV, in perfect agreement with the 
previously reported 0.22 eV activation energy for an oxygen vacancy in amorphous 
Nb2O5 [168]. 

 
146 
 
Figure 7-7: a) Temperature dependent measurements of the device current showing rectification 
with temperature. The current was measured at 1.25 V, which is above the turn-on voltage. At low 
temperatures the Poole-Frenkel current controls the current flow with a low activation energy while 
at high temperatures thermionic emission over a higher energy barrier controls current flow. b) 
Plotting the Poole-Frenkel activation energy at a variety of applied voltages reveals a defect trap 
depth of 0.22 ± 0.01 eV matching the previously reported trap depth for oxygen vacancies in Nb2O5. 
 
The hysteresis necessary for neuristor circuit operation is caused by not reaching a 
steady state current when operating at frequencies of interest to neurological processes. It 
was experimentally observed that the time scale to reach steady state is on the order of 
10’s to 100’s of seconds indicating any reasonable neuromorphic frequency, f > 0.1 Hz, 
will exhibit hysteresis. The fixed charge in Region 1 determines the Region 1 width and 
thus the current through the device. Therefore the rate of filling and emptying of traps at 
the boundary between Region 1 and Region 2 sets the time scale to reach a steady state 
current. Such slow trap dynamics could be caused by either slow emission of electrons 
from the trap states or a current limited filling and emptying of traps. The capture (ce) and 
emission (ee) rates for the trap states can be calculated according to Equations 7.2 – 3 
[145]. 
            
Equation 7.2 
               [ 
     
   ] 
Equation 7.3 

 
147 
where νth is the thermal velocity, σn is the electron capture cross section, n is the density 
of available electrons, Nt is the density of traps, NC is the effective density of states in the 
conduction band, and (EC – Et) is the depth of the trap below the conduction band edge. 
While the exact values for some of these variables are unknown for amorphous Nb2O5, 
typical ranges for these variables are: νth ≈ 107 cm/s, σn ϵ [10-14, 10-16] cm2, NC ϵ [1016, 
1020] cm-3. Based on these values, the timescale for an emission limited process (Nt/ee) is 
nanoseconds to milliseconds, significantly faster than the experimentally observed 
current transients. However, for the experimentally observed range of currents, the 
timescale for a current supply limited capture process (Nt/ce) is milliseconds to 
kiloseconds, matching the experimental timescale for the current transients. Therefore, 
the memdiode hysteresis is likely caused by a current limited electron capture process 
which enables a wide range of frequencies for which the memdiode will exhibit the 
hysteresis necessary for neuromorphic circuitry.

CHAPTER 8 
LIQUID PHASE ELECTRO-EPITAXY OF BULK LITHIUM 
NIOBITE 
 
The devices explored in Chapter 5 (memristors), Chapter 6 (batteries), and 
Chapter 7 (memdiodes) each replicate the functionality of a sub-structure of a biological 
neuron. However, biological neurons exist within a conductive ionic fluid, the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which may be reproduced by bulk lithium niobite. 
 
8.1 Neuromorphic “Sea of Ions” 
 
 
While most neuromorphic architectures focus on replicating the generation, 
scaling, and propagation of voltage spikes called action potentials, biological neurons 
produce action potentials by exchanging ions with the surrounding CSF. This sea of ions 
that surrounds biological neurons is often treated as a ground plane in neuromorphic 
designs, but biologically can support ionic currents. Synchronized activity in a group of 
neurons 
creates 
ion 
waves 
that 
can 
be 
detected 
outside 
the 
skull 
via 
Electroencephalography (EEG). 
 
Mounting evidence indicates that non-synaptic ionic signals within the CSF also 
transmit information between neurons [176]. One example is in single celled bacteria that 
do not possess axons or dendrites. Within a cluster of bacteria, electrical signals of K+ 
ions are exchanged through the surrounding fluid to control the growth of the bacterial 
cluster [177]. The presence of non-synaptic electrical communication in single celled 
organisms suggests that non-synaptic communication is phylogenetically old originating 
in a “protoneuron”. As higher vertebrates developed, these protoneurons differentiated 

 
149 
into many types of neurons, some of which still communicate via non-synaptic electrical 
signals. As one review article summarized, “If a neuronal form is functioning for about 
600 million years we should consider it as an important structure in the basic functions of 
the central nervous system” [176]. In order to replicate the ionic environment of the CSF, 
growth of bulk lithium niobite was explored. 
 
8.2 Historical Liquid Phase Electro-Epitaxy of Lithium Niobite 
 
 
The first reported growth of lithium niobite by liquid phase electro-epitaxy 
(LPEE) was in 1994 and produced hexagonal crystals approximately 2 mm across [92]. 
This and later work [88] were accomplished by electrolysis of a molten salt solution 
consisting of NaBO2, LiF, LiBO2, and Nb2O5. Small crystallites of lithium niobite were 
formed by applying a constant voltage across the molten salt solution. 
 
Lithium metaborate (LiBO2) and Sodium metaborate (NaBO2) are glass forming 
compounds capable of dissolving Nb2O5 [96]. The fusion of Nb2O5 in a borate solution 
creates a niobium bearing mixture that is liquid above 850oC whereas Nb2O5 does not 
melt until 1512oC. Aside from molten borate solutions, niobium compounds are difficult 
to dissolve and other methods for producing a niobium containing solution often involve 
terrifying procedures [178]. 
 
A simpler LPEE chemistry was developed in 2014 by reducing the melt 
constituents to only LiBO2 and Nb2O5 [95]. It was shown that the previous chemistry 
resulted in 9.2% Na and 4.4% F in the resulting crystals. By eliminating the sources of 
sodium and fluorine, these contaminants were also eliminated. While the simpler 

 
150 
chemistry eliminated contaminants, it does require higher temperatures (900oC) [95] than 
the melt containing NaBO2 (800oC) [92]. Heteroepitaxial deposition onto SiC has also 
been explored, but resulted in nucleation of small crystallites rather than a coherent film 
[95]. All previous work on LPEE of lithium niobite has explored a single borate flux to 
Nb2O5 ratio and a single deposition voltage for each substrate. 
 
8.3 Heteroepitaxial Growth on SiC 
 
Heteroepitaxial deposition was performed on n-type SiC substrates with a range 
of melt compositions and deposition voltages. The melt compositions varied from a 
molar ratio (Li2B2O4:Nb2O5) of 267:1 to 8.9:1 where previous attempts at LPEE of 
lithium niobite were from melts with a molar ratio of 15:1. For each melt the current as a 
function of deposition voltage was measured as shown in Figure 8-1. As the quantity of 
dissolved Nb2O5 increases (decreasing molar ratio), the hysteresis in the I-V sweep 
decreases. In addition, for low concentrations of Nb2O5 a plateau is visible between 1 – 
1.25 V. 
 
 
Figure 8-1: Current voltage curves for molten solutions with varying ratios of Li2B2O4:Nb2O5. For 
solutions with a high molar ratio hysteresis is present and a current plateau occurs. The hysteresis is 
diminished and the current plateau is absent for low molar ratio solutions. 

 
151 
 
In traditional aqueous electrodeposition, each of the three regions in Figure 8-1a 
are associated with a specific growth process as shown in Figure 8-2. At low voltages the 
lowest energy reaction occurs and can be described by the Butler-Volmer equation shown 
in Equation 8.1 [179]. 
 
    [   ( 
      
  )     (
      
  
)] 
Equation 8.1 
 
Where Jo is the exchange current density, z is the ionic charge, F is Faraday’s constant, α 
is the charge transfer coefficient for an anodic (αa) or cathodic (αc) reaction, ηa is the 
activation overpotential, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature [179]. 

 
152 
 
Figure 8-2: Traditional interpretation of the three regions present in the current-voltage curve of a 
high molar ratio solution. 
 
Equation 8.1 assumes an abundant supply of ions at the electrode surface. For 
voltages within the current plateau, the reaction becomes mass transport limited where 
diffusion of ions to the electrode surface limits the reaction rate and thus the current. For 
this condition the current density is described by Equation 8.2 [179]. 
 
    (     (
    
  )) 
Equation 8.2 
 
where J1 is the limiting current density and ηc is the concentration overpotential. 

 
153 
 
The high voltage region can be described by the activation of a second reaction 
and a return to reaction limited deposition. The lack of a current plateau in melts with 
higher concentrations of Nb2O5 is consistent with the traditional interpretation where the 
extra Nb2O5 prevents a mass transport limited regime. Likewise, the loss of hysteresis for 
melts with higher concentrations of Nb2O5 suggests that the reaction product deposited 
onto the electrode cannot be re-dissolved into the high concentration melt eliminating the 
second term of Equation 8.1. 
 
Depositions onto SiC substrates were performed within each of the three voltage 
regimes. As shown in Figure 8-3a, deposition at low voltage (0.5 V) from a melt with low 
Nb2O5 concentration (267:1 molar ratio) produced a coalesced thick film of lithium 
niobite with no other phases visible in the XRD. The XRD omega rocking curve for this 
film, shown in Figure 8-3b, had a full width at half maximum of 220 arcsec indicating a 
film well aligned to the underlying SiC substrate with little tilt in the grains. 
 
Figure 8-3: a) Symmetric XRD of a thick film deposited onto SiC from a high molar ratio solution at 
low voltage. The deposited material is c-oriented lithium niobite. b) The omega rocking curve of the 
deposited lithium niobite has a FWHM of 220 arcsec indicating well aligned grains. 
 

 
154 
 
As shown in Figure 8-4a, deposition at a voltage (1.2 V) within the current 
plateau of Figure 8-2a also produced single phase lithium niobite, but with much lower 
XRD intensity than the low voltage deposition. Further, the XRD rocking curve was 
significantly wider with a full width at half maximum of 900 arcsec. This wide rocking 
curve indicates the material is not as well aligned to the SiC substrate. 
 
Figure 8-4: a) Symmetric XRD of a film deposited onto SiC from a high molar ratio solution at a 
voltage within the current plateau. A single XRD peak is visible from c-oriented lithium niobite, but 
with significantly less intensity than the film deposited at low voltage. b) The omega rocking curve of 
the deposited lithium niobite has a FWHM of 900 arcsec indicating less aligned grains than the film 
deposited at low voltage. 
 
 
Examining the surface of the deposited film using AFM, shown in Figure 8-5, the 
film consists of a porous field with a high density of hexagonal pits. These pits are 
approximately 3 µm deep. The appearance of porous material is consistent with a 
diffusion limited growth mode where dissolved ions immediately nucleate upon 
contacting the electrode with little surface mobility. The high rate of nucleation leads to 
porous material with low crystalline quality and low adhesion to the substrate [179]. 

 
155 
 
Figure 8-5: AFM of the film deposited at a voltage within the current plateau showing a porous film 
with hexagonal pits. The porous nature of the film is consistent with diffusion limited growth and 
poor adatom surface mobility. 
 
 
As shown in Figure 8-6, deposition at a high voltage (1.8 V) produced a thick 
uneven layer of material with practically no crystalline order. It is unknown what material 
is formed in the higher voltage oxidation state, but the uneven material formed suggests a 
field driven growth mode that amplifies any substrate roughness. 

 
156 
 
Figure 8-6: Symmetric XRD of material deposited at high voltage from a solution with high molar 
ratio. 
 
 
The current-voltage curves for melts with higher molar ratios of 26.7:1 and 8.9:1 
show little to no hysteresis and no current plateau. These melt compositions are similar to 
the previously reported composition with a molar ratio of 15:1, which produced small 
crystallites of lithium niobite on SiC that did not coalesce into a film. 
 
As shown in Figure 8-7, depositions from a melt with a molar ratio of 26.7:1 
produced mixtures of lithium niobite and lithium niobate. Depositions at lower voltages 
(1.2 V) produced a coalesced film with hexagonal pits and low intensity XRD peaks of 
both lithium niobite and lithium niobate as shown in Figure 8-7a. Depositions at higher 
voltages (1.8 V) produced the same underlying film, but with large hexagonal platelets 

 
157 
growing on the surface. XRD of the higher voltage deposition, shown in Figure 8-7b, 
reveals significantly higher intensity lithium niobite peaks suggesting the higher voltage 
drives the formation of lithium niobite platelets as was previously observed [95]. 
 
 
Figure 8-7: Symmetric XRD and optical images from films deposited from a solution with a molar 
ratio of 26.7:1 at a) 1.2V and b) 1.8V. The low voltage deposition produced a mixture of lithium 
niobiate (LiNbO3) and lithium niobite (LiNbO2). The high voltage deposition produced platelets of 
predominately lithium niobite as was previously observed. 
 
 
Depositions from a melt with a molar ratio of 8.9:1 were crystagraphically similar 
to depositions from the melt with a molar ratio of 26.7:1. At low voltages (0.5 V) a 
mixture of lithium niobite and lithium niobate was formed as shown in Figure 8-8a. At 
high voltages (1.8 V) only lithium niobite was visible in the XRD as shown in Figure 
8-8b. However, neither deposition produced large XRD peaks. 
 

 
158 
 
Figure 8-8: Symmetric XRD from films deposited from a solution with a molar ratio of 8.9:1 at a) 
0.5V and b) 1.8V. The low voltage deposition produced a mixture of lithium niobiate (LiNbO3) and 
lithium niobite (LiNbO2). The high voltage deposition produced predominately lithium niobite. 
Neither deposition produced material with large XRD peaks. 
 
 
The reason for the small XRD peaks shown in Figure 8-8 is that little material 
adhered to the SiC substrates. As shown in Figure 8-9, a melt with a molar ratio of 8.9:1 
contains enough source material to produce volume nucleation within the melt itself. 
These free standing crystals are removed when the borate solution is dissolved away from 
the substrate. 

 
159 
 
Figure 8-9: optical images of the material deposited from a solution with molar ratio 8.9:1. At both a) 
low voltage (0.5V) and b) high voltage (1.8V) volume nucleation within the molten solution produces 
crystals away from the substrate surface. 
 
Examining the depositions performed at a variety of applied voltages and melt 
ratios, two conclusions can be made. First, increasing the amount of Nb2O5 dissolved into 
the melt changes the mass transport properties of the deposition so that at low 
concentrations it is possible to have a mass transport limited deposition and at high 
concentrations the deposition is always reaction rate limited. In addition, increasing the 
Nb2O5 concentration increases the average oxidation state of the melt allowing the 
formation of higher oxidation state materials such as lithium niobate. 
The second conclusion is that increasing the applied voltage reduces the oxidation 
state of the deposited material. This conclusion should be expected because the applied 
electric field drives cations toward the SiC electrode and anions away from the SiC 
electrode. However, the oxidation state of the resulting deposition is not purely derived 
from the applied voltage as the Nb2O5 concentration also affects the deposited material. 

 
160 
 
8.4 Homoepitaxial Growth of Bulk Lithium Niobite 
 
The ideal form of bulk lithium niobite to replicate the biological sea of ions in an 
ion based neuromorphic architecture would be free standing lithium niobite wafers. 
Previously reported LPEE of lithium niobite created free standing crystals with 
dimensions of a few millimeters. These depositions often yielded crystals with larger 
apparent dimensions that were composed of multiple small crystals attached together as 
shown in Figure 8-10. It is unclear if the larger collections of crystals were attached by 
nucleating new crystallites onto the face of the growing crystal or by bonding crystals 
together with non-soluble reaction products. When breaking apart the attached crystals a 
white powder is often visible between the individual crystals. 

 
161 
 
Figure 8-10: Example of a bulk lithium niobite crystal composed of layers of smaller crystals. It is 
unclear if this layering is due to nucleating new crystals onto the surface of the growing crystal or 
due to the precipitation of insoluble material between the individual crystals. 
 
Reduction of the borate melt to form an insoluble compound is one option for the 
source of the observed white powder. It is known that lithium metaborate (LiBO2) 
participates in the electrochemical reaction to form lithium niobite because it is the only 
source of lithium present in the melt. Removing lithium from lithium metaborate yields 
lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7). Lithium tetraborate has a melting point of 917 oC higher 
than the 900 oC operating temperature previously used. Therefore, all attempts to grow 
bulk lithium niobite herein were performed at an operating temperature of 950 oC to 
avoid lithium tetraborate precipitants. 

 
162 
Attempts to grow bulk lithium niobite by homoepitaxial LPEE were performed at 
the previous standard operating conditions (1.1 V from a molten solution with molar ratio 
15:1) [95]. Multiple iterations of 1 hour depositions were performed. After each

solution was prepared. After three iterations the seed had grown from less than 0.01 g to 
0.71 g, but still consisted of multiple layers of material as shown in Figure 8-11.

CHAPTER 9 
DEVICE MODEL FOR VOLATILE MEMRISTORS WITH LOW 
ACTIVATION ENERGY FOR ION MOTION 
Memristive systems are described by the set of Equations 9.1 – 9.2, where  ⃗ ,   , 
and    are respectively the system input, the system output, and an internal state variable 
and functions f and g are arbitrary [26]. These three variables are generally vector 
quantities allowing for multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and multiple internal 
mechanisms. This formalism provides a framework to describe multi-functional 
memristive devices that can be controlled electrically, thermally, chemically, optically, or 
magnetically.

While the mathematical, state variable description for a memristor provides no 
insight into the physical mechanisms behind a real device, mixed ion-electron conductors 
(MIEC) such as lithium niobite [73] have demonstrated a rich set of behaviors including 
energy storage, rectification, negative differential resistance, and memristive hysteresis 
[180, 181]. In general, the kinetics of atomic motion are governed by ionic hopping 
conductivity [181] thermally activated according to an Arrhenius relation, as shown in 
Equation 3.5. Shown in Table 1 are a variety of MIEC memristors and their associated 
activation energies for ion motion. 
9.1 Activated Mobile Ion Hopping Conduction 

 
164 
Ion conduction between discretely bound sites can be described by hopping 
conductivity where the hopping frequency (Γ) is given by Equation 9.3 [182, 183]. 
  [  (   )  (  
 )]   (  
  ) 
Equation 9.3 
Where ωo is the hopping attempt frequency (related to the phonon frequency), c is the 
probability of finding an occupied site at the hopping destination and is dependent on the 
vacancies present, d is the hopping distance, EA is the energy barrier between hopping 
sites, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and α is a localization 
parameter related to the extent of the ion’s wavefunction. While we retain the full 
equation as described by Mott [182, 183], this general form of Equation 9.3 is often 
simplified by replacing the bracketed term with one value by combining the distance 
dependence into the attempt frequency and ignoring the probability of finding an 
unoccupied site, which is acceptable for dilute concentrations. 
When exposed to an electric field E, the energy barrier EA is lowered by qEd in 
the direction of the electric field and raised by the same amount opposing the electric 
field, as shown in Equation 9.4, where q is the charge of an electron.

Figure 9-1: The bracketed terms in the full exponential form of hopping conductivity, Equation 9.7, 
and the linearized form, Equation 9.10. The linear approximation matches the exponential form at 
low electric fields but diverges at high electric fields. This data was calculated using d = 3x10-10 m and 
T = 800K. 
 
As shown in Figure 9-1, the linear approximation is not valid for fields as high as 
1010 V/m, as are experienced during the breakdown of filamentary memristors, but is 
approximately true for fields as high as 108 V/m, which covers most of the practical 
breakdown fields in real materials. Therefore, for large devices such as LiNbO2 
memristors [74] with length scales on the order of 100 µm and low electric fields, the ion 
current can be linearized.  
By factoring the bracketed term, the linearized ion hopping current equation 
appears as a classical drift – diffusion equation, shown in Equation 9.11, where the 

 
167 
mobility and diffusion coefficient become concentration dependent, as shown in 
Equations 9.12 – 9.14.

9.2 Generalized Memristor Model 
To develop a mathematical model for mixed ion-electron memristors, we begin 
with the general system of equations for a memristive device, Equations 9.1 – 9.2, 
informed by the ion hopping kinetics previously developed, Equations 9.11 – 9.14. We 
define the input to the system as the applied voltage V and the output of the system as the 
current through the device I. The specific physical state variable parameters replacing the 
generalized state variables,   , are the scalars φ, representing the distribution of ions, and 
the temperature T.  Rewriting Equations 9.1 – 9.2 with the above variables yields 
Equations 9.15 – 9.17.

Equation 9.16 

 
168 
   [  
  ]  [ 
 ] 
Equation 9.17 
where G is function describing the device conductance and t is time.  Looking first at the 
state variable dynamics, Equation 9.16, the temperature of the device can be easily 
approximated by the differential Equation 9.18 that balances Joule heating and 
conductive heat transfer.  
   
   
  
   
 
    [     
    (    )
  
] 
Equation 9.18 
Equation 9.18 is the result of thermal energy input to the device by Joule heating 
and conductive heat transfer removing heat from the device along a thermal length. The 
device’s temperature change is governed by the total heat capacity. The variables 
involved are: m is the mass of the device, C is the material’s specific heat capacity, V is 
the applied voltage, k is the thermal conductivity, A is the surface area of the device, TE 
is the temperature of the environment, and ΔL is the length for thermal transfer. The first 
term in the brace describes Joule heating while the second term is the conductive heat 
loss. No explicit device geometry is defined for this generalization, but various 
geometries can be approximated by changing the mass, surface area, and thermal transfer 
length. 
While the temperature dynamics can be derived from basic physical relationships, 
the specific dynamics of the ion distribution state variable φ will depend generally on the 
internal physics of the modelled device. However, it will be shown that the rich behavior 
of memristive devices can be described by the ion distribution state variable dynamics 
shown in Equation 9.19. 
   
   
  
            
Equation 9.19 

 
169 
A is a parameter dependent on device geometry (i.e. scaling of voltage to electric field), 
but in more complex implementation can encompass many other physical effects that 
relate the external applied voltage to the change in ion distribution.  A is thus a 
generalized parameter describing the strength of the applied voltage V on the ion 
distribution state variable.  Likewise, D describes the strength of ion distribution recovery 
accounting for physical effects such as diffusion. The ion distribution state variable 
dynamics, Equation 9.19, build on earlier models that include the first voltage driven 
term but neglect any recovery mechanisms [46]. It should be noted that the ion 
distribution state variable, φ, cannot be explicitly defined outside the context of a specific 
device geometry and as such the units of φ, A, and D are not yet definable.  
In general, the coefficients A and D can be functions of many variables. However, 
because they describe the ease of ion motion, both coefficients must follow an Arrhenius 
relationship and thus, from Equations 9.11 – 9.12, account for the ion motion activation 
energy shown in Equation 9.20. 
        
    
Equation 9.20 
Examining Equation 9.20, it is clear that in the steady state when there is no net 
ion movement (i.e. 
  
    ), the voltage driven term and distribution recovery term must 
balance. This limits the extent of the ion distribution state variable placing a maximum 
value on φ, shown in Equation 9.21, for a given maximum voltage Vmax. 
     
     
 
  
Equation 9.21 
Finally, while the ion motion is controlled by the activation energy and available 
thermal energy, the conductivity of the device is controlled by the available electrons (or 
holes) and their distribution. The exact form of the device conductivity as a function of 

 
170 
ion distribution G(φ) will depend on the specific memristor.  Equations 9.15, 9.18, and 
9.19 combined forms a set of equations that fully describe memristor behavior, 
specifically, the conductance, thermal response, and the associated thermally activated 
hopping motion of ions.  The task for modelling memristors of differing underlying 
physics is then to define A, D, and a functional relationship between G and φ.   
 
9.3 Lithium Niobite Memristor Model 
 
For the lithium niobite volatile memristor the internal state variable is based on a 
continuous ion distribution. Finite element models of the LiNbO2 memristor [87] show 
transient complex ion distributions and the resulting conductance. However, in all cases, 
at slow excitation or in steady state, the complex ion distributions collapse into a steady 
state linear ion distribution and an associated conductance.  In these materials operated in 
electric fields from 101 to 105 V/m, the linearized mobility model is certainly valid.  
Given this linear ion distribution and its associated conductance state, one can easily 
connect the ion distribution (a slope in steady state) to the conductance, G, and again 
connect that conductance to the flux-linkage, φ, through the use of the current-voltage 
curve.    
Examining experimental data, shown in Figure 9-2, from a large scale volatile 
LiNbO2 memristor, the characteristic pinched hysteresis of a memristor is observed. This 
data was measured at 42 mHz on a lateral ring-dot structure with asymmetric contact 
areas and a device length of 55 µm. 

 
171 
 
Figure 9-2: The experimental current – voltage relation for a volatile LiNbO2 memristor measured at 
42 mHz. 
 
 
Since the conductance of the device is known from the slope of the current-
voltage curve for each time point and the flux-linkage can be determined as the time 
integral of the voltage, one can plot the experimental data in Figure 9-2 as a conductance 
versus flux-linkage as shown in Figure 9-3.  The flux linkage represents the combined 
effects of an applied voltage and the time the voltage has been applied making small 
voltages applied for long times as effective as large voltages for short times.  In Figure 
9-3, two conductance values at zero φ and asymmetric shape around zero φ are apparent. 
This asymmetry in the experimental data is likely due to asymmetric contacts on the ring-

 
172 
dot structure and is not accounted for in the following model. Such effects have been 
accounted for in previous finite element models [87]. 
 
Figure 9-3: The experimental Conductance – Phi relation from a LiNbO2 memristor and the fit used 
to model the device. The two values at Phi = 0 are due to the asymmetric contact geometry of the 
experimental device. By modelling only one contact geometry a symmetric device is modelled. 
 
Fitting the experimental data for one of the contact polarities, which forces a 
symmetric response, the following conductance, shown in Equation 9.22, was empirically 
fit to the experimental volatile memristor conductance. 
 ( )     
     
  (  )  
Equation 9.22 
Where GH = 0.01 Ω-1 is the high conductance state, GL = 0.005 Ω-1 is the low 
conductance state, and c = 0.2 is a width parameter used to fit the experimental data. 

 
173 
For steady state simulations, it has been shown that the ion concentration profile, N(x), in 
these volatile memristors is linear [87]. However, a linear ion distribution is incompatible 
with the current continuity equation when simplifications are made that are necessary for 
a simple model compatible with large scale circuit applications. Such simplifications 
include a uniform electric field and a negligible space charge due to ion-electron 
separation (i.e. quasi-neutrality). The linear ion distribution incompatibility arises 
because the derivative of the current density (dJ/dx) does not include a diffusion term 
necessary to balance the drift term and bring the ion motion (dNLi/dt) to zero as shown in 
Equation 9.23. 
  
    
 
 
  
    
 
     
  
       
Equation 9.23 
This non-physical result is likely due to the two assumptions above. At long time 
scales the electrons and ions separate violating quasi-neutrality and setting up an electric 
field opposing the applied field. However, for shorter time scales, a transient ion 
distribution occurs [87] that is modelled herein as a cubic ion distribution profile as 
shown in Equation 9.24. 
 ( )      ( ) (  
 
 )   ( ) (

The cubic distribution does not violate the current continuity equation and can 
thus be modelled simply as shown in Equation 9.25. 
  
    
 
 
  
      
  
        
   
    
Equation 9.25 
Taking the first and second derivatives of Equation 9.24 and inserting them into Equation 
9.25 yields Equation 9.26.

174 
 
Because γ(t) and λ(t) are of the same order of magnitude for the modelled devices 
and the length scale is on the order of 10-2 cm, the second drift term is much smaller than 
the first drift term and may be dropped. This simplification yields Equation 9.27. 
  
       ( )       (  
 
 )  ( ) 
Equation 9.27 
 
At long time scales the ion distribution becomes linear and the cubic term in the 
ion distribution, λ(t), presumably goes to zero. However, for faster time scales the linear 
term γ(t) is nearly constant and the cubic term becomes the dominant time dependent 
term. An estimate for the frequency at which this transition occurs can be determined 
from previous finite element models that examine the step response of LiNbO2 
memristors [21]. Previous models have shown that for a device with order 1 um length, a 
cubic profile is present 0.1 sec after the voltage step, but a linear profile is present after 1 
sec [87]. Scaling these times for the 100 um device modelled herein, it is expected that 
the cubic approximation can be made for time scales shorter than 10 seconds or faster 
than 0.1 Hz. This is consistent with experimental results testing the step response of 
LiNbO2 memristors [21]. Thus for the time scales of interest to neuromorphic computing 
(0.1 – 100 Hz) the linear term can be treated as effectively constant, γ(t) ≈ γ, and the 
cubic term is the dominant time dependent term in the ion motion. Taking the time 
derivative of the ion concentration under this assumption yields Equation 9.28.

Evaluating the change in ion concentration at the contact (x = L) and setting 
Equation 9.27 and Equation 9.28 equal, we then obtain the ion dynamics Equation 9.29.

This dynamical equation follows the same form as Equation 9.19 allowing the

λ. Thus the ion dynamics can be written as Equations 9.30 – 9.32.

In addition, the activation of ion motion by thermal energy is not necessary for the 
low activation energy lithium motion as the temperature of the simulated device varies by 
less than 1oC as shown in Figure 9-5.

It was theorized that for memristive mobile ion-electron conductors (MIECs), a 
decrease in frequency would lead to a current-voltage relation with peaks as the mobile 
dopants redistribute [180]. This effect is reproduced, as shown in Figure 9-6a, using the 
same simulation parameters as in the volatile memristor example, by decreasing the 
frequency one order of magnitude. It should be noted that this current-voltage relation is 
distinctly different than that for the filamentary memristor, which also exhibits a peak 
with dynamic negative differential resistance. The difference arises near the origin where 
a filamentary memristor’s current-voltage relation crosses at the origin, but a volatile 
memristor’s current-voltage relation is pinched at the origin.  The peaks in the volatile 

 
178 
memristor current-voltage curve result from diffusion assisted ion recovery returning the 
ion gradient to zero before the voltage reaches the maximum value. When the ion 
gradient (φ) is zero, the conductance is maximized as shown in Figure 9-3.

exhibiting dynamic negative differential resistance as ionic diffusion returns the ion gradient to zero 
before the voltage reaches a maximum. b) Experimental data showing dynamic negative differential 
resistance and an initial high conductance transient. 
 
This dynamic negative differential resistance has been experimentally observed in 
lithium niobite volatile memristors. As shown in Figure 9-6b for a single current-voltage 
sweep, a peak in current occurs before the voltage reaches its maximum value. In 
addition to the dynamic negative differential resistance, both the simulation, Figure 9-6a, 
and the experimental data, Figure 9-6b, show an initial increase in resistance as the 
voltage sweep begins at -1 volt. This initial transient effect is caused by the maximum (in 
magnitude) voltage (-1 V) occurring at the same time as the maximum conductance state 
resulting from V·t=0 in Figure 9-3. This condition does not occur again after the initial 
condition because the diffusion assisted ion recovery creates a phase offset between the 
maximum voltage and flat ion distribution.

9.4 Simplified Model for SPICE Circuit Simulations 
 
Equations 9.30 – 9.32 describing the behavior of a lithium niobite memristor can 
be implemented directly as a SPICE circuit element as shown in Figure 9-7. 
 
Figure 9-7: SPICE schematic for the memristor model. Portions in black directly implement the 
characteristic equation of a memristor while the red portion implements feedback necessary for 
volatile behavior. The input resistor shown in green provides continuity during the first simulation 
step and should be chosen to have a large value so that it does not affect the model’s operation. 
 
 
The portions of this SPICE implementation shown in black are identical to early 
memristor SPICE elements that directly implemented the memristor equations without 
any physical associations [184]. The red feedback loop implements the ion state variable 
recovery dynamics through the diffusion of lithium ions. Finally, the green resistor RO 
should be chosen such that it is significantly more resistive than the device conductance 

 
180 
G in order to minimize its impact on the element. RO ensures model continuity during the 
first simulation step.

CHAPTER 10 
VOLATILE ADAPTABILITY IN NEUROMORPHIC CIRCUITRY  
The device model for a volatile memristor discussed in Chapter 9 is 
computationally simple while still incorporating physical parameters such as device 
geometry and dopant levels that can be used to modify device operation parameters such 
as the device speed and the magnitude of the memristance change. While these volatile 
memristors could implement simple neural functions such as short term memory as a 
single device, they do not necessarily implement more complex neuromorphic functions 
on their own. However, when included in neuromorphic circuits, volatile memristors can 
add biologically realistic volatile functionality without significantly increasing the 
complexity of these circuits. Two example circuits are discussed herein including a 
simple Schmitt Trigger circuit and the Neuristor circuit.  
Biologically realistic spike-frequency adaptation is implemented in a Schmitt 
Trigger based neuron circuit by replacing one of the resistors with a volatile memristor. 
Likewise, replacing a resistor with a volatile memristor in the Neuristor circuit results in 
bursting/chattering behavior that is not present in the circuit prior to the change. 
 
10.1 Schmitt Trigger with Spike Frequency Adaptation 
 
 
Previously a non-volatile memristor with external programming circuitry was 
included in an op-amp Schmitt Trigger to create a variable threshold Schmitt Trigger 
[185]. The circuit presented in Figure 10-1 differs from this previous work in two ways 
that are important for neuromorphic circuit applications. First, the memristor 
implementation is a volatile analog memristor rather than a non-volatile filamentary 

 
182 
memristor. Second, the circuit presented is self-programming and requires no external 
programming controller. This leads to a higher computational density. These distinctions 
make it useful for neuromorphic spike-frequency adaptation. 
 
Figure 10-1: A collector-base coupled BJT Schmitt Trigger circuit diagram with a volatile memristor 
substituted for resistor RB1. 
 
 
The circuit shown in Figure 10-1 is a classical collector-base coupled BJT Schmitt 
Trigger. Advantages of this design for a neuromorphic threshold detector are a near zero 
low-output voltage and a high-output voltage set by the voltage divider RC2, RB1. These 
two attributes provide a near ground output and an adaptable high state output for the 
analog spike generation circuit this Schmitt Trigger controls. 

 
183 
 
The BJT Schmitt Trigger circuit works as follows: while Vin is below the rising 
threshold, transistor Q1 is off and Q2 is on. The output voltage is tied to ground through 
transistor Q2. The base-emitter voltage of Q1 is set by the voltage divider Rin, RB1 and 
the rising threshold occurs when this voltage divider forward biases the base-emitter 
junction of Q1. 
 
After transitioning to the high-output state, transistor Q1 is on and Q2 is off. The 
output voltage is set by the voltage divider RC2, RB1. As Vin decreases, the falling 
threshold occurs when the base of Q1 is deprived of current. This requires the current 
through RB1 to equal the current through Rin. Assuming ideal BJTs, these thresholds and 
outputs are given by Equations 10.1 – 10.4. 
    
(       )   
   
 
Equation 10.1 
        
   (       )

Equation 10.3 
          
   (       )
       
 
Equation 10.4 
 
Where VT↑ is the rising threshold voltage, VT↓ is the falling threshold voltage, VCC 
is the power supply voltage, VBE is the BJT base-emitter forward bias voltage and the low 
and high subscript on VOut indicates the output voltage in the low and high state 
respectively. 
 
From Equations 10.1 – 10.4 it is clear that resistor RB1 is crucial in setting the 
rising threshold, the falling threshold, and the high output voltages. Figure 10-2 shows 
the Schmitt Trigger circuit transfer function for two values of RB1 easily achievable with 
the lithium niobite memristors described in Chapter 5 and Chapter 9. 

 
184 
 
Figure 10-2: Changes in the Schmitt Trigger transfer function for different values of the memristor 
resistance including changes in the rising threshold voltage, falling threshold voltage, and high 
output voltage. 
 
 
Changing the value of RB1 by only 150% changes the rising threshold by -10%, 
the falling threshold by 1000%, and the high output voltage by 10%. The low output 
voltage remains unchanged in the millivolt range. As the resistance of RB1 changes in 
Figure 10-2 from 10kΩ to 4kΩ, three distinct changes occur that are important for neural 
processing: 
 
First, the rising threshold voltage increases. The rising threshold indicates how 
much input signal must be accumulated before the neuron outputs a spike. By increasing 
the rising threshold voltage, spikes become harder to initiate. 
 
Second, the high output voltage decreases. A decrease in the high output voltage 
could be used by the spike generation circuit to implement spike-amplitude adaptation. It 

 
185 
is known that some biological neurons exhibit decreasing spike amplitude during bursting 
behavior while others show no change or more complex behaviors [166]. 
 
Third, the falling threshold decreases. This is important because the pulse width is 
related to the difference between the rising threshold and the falling threshold. After the 
Schmitt Trigger goes to the high state and initiates an output pulse, feedback must reset 
the input integrator. Since the Schmitt trigger can only be reset by the integrator being 
discharged below the falling threshold, the time that the Schmitt Trigger remains in the 
high state increases as the falling threshold is reduced. This increased spike time is 
consistent with biological spike-frequency adaptation and may also be useful for spike-
shape 
adaptation 
in 
the 
spike 
generation 
circuit. 
For 
example, 
the 
“afterhyperpolarization” phase of a biological neuron spike becomes more pronounced 
after a high level input [166]. The increased pulse width produced by the Schmitt Trigger 
for high level inputs could be used in the spike generation circuit to accomplish this 
spike-shape adaptation.

Schmitt Trigger on the overall neuron performance. The output of the Schmitt Trigger is fed back to 
the integrator to reset the integrator after the neuron outputs a spike.

The volatile memristor Schmitt Trigger was simulated in the simplified 
neuromorphic circuit shown in Figure 10-3. The negative feedback from the Schmitt 
Trigger to the integrator was used as the integrator reset mechanism. 
 
It has been shown experimentally that for small constant inputs biological neurons 
produce repetitive spikes with frequencies that scale with the input value. Additionally, 
larger value inputs produce temporally-expanded spike widths that are sometimes 
accompanied by decreased spike amplitude [166]. As will be shown, this circuit mimics 
these biological behaviors that are thought to be crucial for biological and neuromorphic 
computation. 
 
Figure 10-4: The output voltage and memristor resistance for six different DC input voltages to the 
circuit in Figure 16. The six input voltages are: a) 0.3 V, b) 0.67 V, c) 1 V, d) 1.5 V, e) 2 V, and f) 3V. 
 
 
The output voltage for the volatile memristor Schmitt Trigger neuromorphic 
circuit is shown in red in Figure 10-4 for six different DC inputs. For Figure 10-4a-c 

 
187 
corresponding to smaller inputs 0.3 – 1 volts, the circuit produces repetitive pulses that 
increase in frequency with increasing input. In Figure 10-4d-f corresponding to larger 
inputs 1.5 – 3 volts, the output shows signs of adaptation including pulse broadening and 
a smooth decrease in pulse amplitude. Compared to biological pulse broadening, this 
simulation produced magnified results. Biological neurons broaden spikes by 20% - 
100% [166] while this simulation demonstrates pulse broadening of 540%. This increased 
pulse broadening compared to biological spike broadening could be limited by choosing a 
smaller memristance change. 
 
Examining the resistance of the volatile memristor for each of these six cases, 
shown in black in Figure 10-4, reveals why this adaptation occurs. For the small input 
voltages of Figure 10-4a-c, the memristor programming is balanced by the pulses and 
inter-pulse intervals so that the resistance remains near 10kΩ corresponding to the φ = 0 
value in Figure 9-3. This allows each successive pulse to start from the same value on the 
W(φ) curve. Thus, the circuit has no memory of previous pulses. For the larger inputs in 
Figure 10-4d-f, there is insufficient inter-pulse time for the memristor to fully recover 
back to 10kΩ and the memristor self-programs. This memory functionality of the 
memristor causes temporary changes in the Schmitt Trigger transfer function and thus the 
pulse widths and magnitudes.  These changes mimic biological spike frequency 
adaptation. 

 
188 
 
Figure 10-5: Three operational regimes for the Adaptive Schmitt Trigger.  Input voltages below the 
low voltage programming threshold or above the high voltage programming threshold program the 
memristor producing spike frequency adaptation. Input voltages between these limits produce 
repetitive pulses that do not change with time. 
 
 
The range of input voltages that result in adaptive and non-adaptive behavior is 
shown in Figure 10-5 where the feedback coefficient D, described by Equation 9.32, 
determines the range of input values for which the memristor causes adaptation. By 
noting that the polarity of the voltage across the memristor switches sign for pulses 
versus inter-pulse time periods we see that adaptation occurs when the voltage across the 
memristor during each pulse is not sufficiently balanced by the restoring voltage across 
the memristor during the inter-pulse time. Input voltages larger than the high voltage 
programming threshold (green line in Figure 10-5) program the memristor during each 
output pulse because there is insufficient inter-pulse time for recovery. This condition 

 
189 
results in spike-frequency adaptation. Likewise, inputs below the low voltage 
programming threshold (blue line in Figure 10-5) program the memristor during the inter-
pulse time. This low input programming condition is easily avoidable by choosing a 
sufficiently large value for D, described in Equation 9.32, making relaxation faster. The 
balanced voltage curve (red line in Figure 10-5) indicates the input voltage required to 
maintain a mean value of φ=0. This occurs when the pulse frequency balances 
programming from the pulse and the inter-pulse interval. Also shown by a dashed line in 
Figure 10-5 is the circuit activation threshold. Because the Schmitt Trigger output is 
subtracted from the integrator input as a reset mechanism, shown in Figure 10-3, inputs 
below the Schmitt Trigger’s low state output cannot initiate a pulse. This low input 
“leak” effectively implements a leaky integrate and fire neuron model. 
 
The six simulation conditions shown in Figure 10-4 are indicated on Figure 10-5 
as dots. Figure 10-4a, Vin = 0.3V, is slightly below the low voltage programming 
threshold and Figure 10-4c, Vin = 1V, is slightly above the high voltage programming 
threshold. Since neither of these cases show significant adaptation, this reveals that the 
programming thresholds are soft thresholds defining the limits of memristor 
programming. This soft threshold is more consistent with biology than a hard threshold 
device in that biological spike-frequency adaptation is governed by ionic concentrations 
changing populations of conductances [166]. 
 
In order to mimic spike-frequency adaptation, there are two reasons this circuit 
must use a volatile memristor. First, after the circuit has been stimulated by an input 
above the high voltage programming threshold such that the memristor becomes 
programmed, it is necessary for the circuit to recover back to the un-programmed state. 

 
190 
While it may be possible to accomplish this with a non-volatile memristor and some extra 
circuitry, a volatile memristor can be implemented in a single device without additional 
wiring and will improve the overall circuit density. Second, the ability of the circuit to 
produce repeatable pulses for a range of small value inputs and then adapt for larger 
inputs cannot be achieved with a non-volatile memristor. 
 
As shown in Figure 10-5, as D approaches zero and the memristor becomes non-
volatile the range of stable input voltages where the memristor does not program 
collapses to a single value. This collapse occurs because without the restoring feedback, 
non-volatile memristors cannot balance the programming voltages from the pulses and 
inter-pulse intervals. 
 
10.2 Adaptive Neuristor Circuit 
 
The Neuristor circuit was first proposed in 1962 as a method for signal 
propagation over long distances without attenuation similar to signal propagation in a 
biological axon [165]. The original circuit consists of relaxation oscillators biased below 
the threshold for oscillation resistively coupled together as shown in Figure 10-6. A small 
input pulse destabilizes the first oscillator which in turn destabilizes the next oscillator 
and so forth propagating the initial pulse down the cable regenerating it at each node. In 
2013, a modified topology was proposed that reduced the number of circuit components 
by combining many of the control resistors and coupling resistors [23].  
 

 
191 
 
Figure 10-6: Circuit schematic for the original Neuristor with coupled relaxation oscillators that are 
triggered in a cascade propagating an original input pulse so that it regenerates at each node. 
 
In order to enable the relaxation oscillators in the Neuristor circuit, a switching 
element must be included. Multiple physical devices have been proposed for this element 
including thyristors [165] and memristors [23]. In addition, the memdiode discussed in 
Chapter 7 exhibits the rectification and hysteresis necessary for this circuit element. For 
the following circuit simulations, a switch with hysteresis is implemented with the 
current-voltage characteristics shown in Figure 10-7. 
 

 
192 
 
Figure 10-7: Current-voltage curve for the switch used in the following simulations.  
 
 
The key parameters that define the switching element are the voltage at which it 
switches from the high resistance state to the low resistance state (VON), the voltage at 
which it switches from the low resistance state to the high resistance state (VOFF) and the 
resistances in the high resistance state (ROFF) and low resistance state (RON). It should be 
noted that this switching element model does not capture slow time dependent current 
transients, such as those observed in the memdiodes discussed in Chapter 7, which may 
add additional functionality.  
10.2.1 Relaxation Oscillators 
A single relaxation oscillator, shown in Figure 10-8, only oscillates if the applied 
voltage and control resistance are within certain limits. Under steady state conditions, the 

 
193 
voltage across the switch is determined by the voltage divider RControl – Switch. The 
voltage across the control resistor (VR) can then be described by VApplied – VSwitch as 
shown by the red dashed lines in Figure 10-8. The relaxation oscillator only oscillates if 
the current-voltage curve for the control resistor crosses the negative resistance line of the 
switch as shown in Figure 10-8. 
 
 
Figure 10-8: (Left) Circuit schematic for a relaxation oscillator. (Right) Current-voltage curve of the 
switching element and control resistor. The relaxation oscillator will oscillate so long as the current-
voltage curve of the control resistor crosses the negative resistance portion of the switching element’s 
current-voltage curve. 
 
The limits on the applied voltage and control resistance can thus be described by 
Equations 10.5 – 10.7 
      (  (        ) (
   
               ))

(      )
   
 
Equation 10.7 
where VA is the applied input voltage and VON, VOFF, RON, and ROFF are the four 
parameters previously defined for the switching element. The effects of the applied 

 
194 
voltage and the control resistance on the relaxation oscillator are shown in Figure 10-9. 
Unless otherwise specified, the various component values are as shown in Figure 10-8. 
 
Figure 10-9: Effect of input voltage and control resistance on the behavior of a relaxation oscillator. 
 
For applied voltages below the threshold voltage, the circuit does not oscillate as 
the switching element is never turned on. However, above the threshold voltage, 
increasing the voltage applied to the relaxation oscillator increases the oscillation 
frequency by increasing the current charging the capacitor. The time necessary to 
discharge the capacitor is slightly increased by increasing the input voltage as the 
capacitor is simultaneously being charged through the control resistor and discharged 
through the switching element. 
Changing the resistance of the control resistor also affects the relaxation oscillator 
behavior. For resistances above the allowable resistance range, defined in Equation 10.7, 
the switching element never switches on. Likewise, for resistances below the allowable 

 
195 
resistance range, defined in Equation 10.6, the switching element never switches off. 
However, between the resistance limits, there is a maximum in the oscillation frequency 
as shown in Figure 10-10. High values for the control resistor create long charge times, 
given in Equation 10.8, decreasing the oscillation frequency. Likewise, low values for the 
control resistor create long discharge times, given in Equation 10.9, by simultaneously 
charging the capacitor during the discharge cycle. Therefore, by replacing the control 
resistance in the Neuristor’s relaxation oscillators with a volatile memristor that spans 
this range of behaviors, it is expected that adaptive behaviors can be added to the 
Neuristor circuit.

10.2.2 Neuristor Circuit 
The Neuristor circuit only replicates the signal propagation functionality of a 
biological axon. In order to explore adaptive behavior in the Neuristor, a simple neuron 
circuit was simulated as shown in Figure 10-11. The input to the Neuristor was attached 
to a simple RC integration circuit replicating the biological cell body. The RC time 
constant of this integrator was set to the RC time constant observed in biological neurons 
[166]. The biological synapses and dendrites were simulated with a DC current source 
representing the summation of a large number of pulses. While the DC current source is 

 
197 
not strictly an accurate representation of an in-vitro biological neuron, it is a standard 
procedure for testing the response of biological neurons [166]. 
 
Figure 10-11: Circuit schematic of a simple artificial neuron composed of a DC input current (green) 
representing the summation of many input spikes, an RC circuit (red) representing the resistance 
and capacitance of a neurons cell membrane, and the neuristor circuit representing the neuron’s 
axon. The Neuristor is composed of cascaded relaxation oscillators (blue). 
 
The Neuristor circuit as proposed does not exhibit any adaptive behavior such as 
bursting, chattering, or spike-frequency adaptation. As shown in Figure 10-12 and Figure 
10-13a, increasing the input current increases the output spike frequency similar to how 
increasing the input voltage of a single relaxation oscillator increases the output 
frequency. Therefore, another component within the Neuristor circuit must supply the 
dynamics for volatile adaptive behavior. As shown in Figure 10-9, changing the control 
resistor in a single relaxation oscillator can significantly affect the output frequency. 
Likewise, changing the resistor R2 will change the behavior of the second relaxation 
oscillator containing Memristor2. In addition, changing the resistor R2 will change the 
coupling dynamics between the two relaxation oscillators. 

 
198 
 
Figure 10-12: Effect of varying input currents to the simple Neuristor based neuron circuit. 
Increasing the input current increases the spike rate and causes accumulation of charge on the input 
capacitor, but does not result in chattering or bursting behavior. 
 
The maximum voltage across resistor R2 during a spike does not change with 
increasing input current as the current is set by the voltage divider Memristor1 – R2 – 
Memristor2. However, increasing the input current does increase the spike frequency 
which in turn increases the average voltage across R2 in a linear manner as shown in 
Figure 10-13c. As changing the resistance of R2 is expected to change the Neuristor’s 
behavior, the relation between input current and average voltage across R2 provides a 
mechanism to program R2. 
 

 
199 
 
Figure 10-13: a) Effect of input current on the output spike frequency of the Neuristor based neuron 
circuit. b) Effect of input current on the average voltage across resistor R2. c) Effect of output spike 
frequency on the average voltage across R2 showing a linear trend. d) Effect of input current on the 
voltage range of the input capacitor showing accumulated charge as the input current increases. 
 
Changing the resistance of R2, shown in Figure 10-14, produces a variety of 
different spike behaviors. For larger resistances, trains of single spikes occur where the 
spike frequency increases with decreasing resistance. However, within this range the 
average voltage across R2 decreases because, despite the slight increase in spike 
frequency, the voltage profile narrows such that the resistor is exposed to higher voltages 
for less time. 
Decreasing the resistance of R2 below a threshold produces both chattering (12 
kΩ) and bursting (10 kΩ) behavior. In each of these modes the RC time constant of the 

 
200 
second relaxation oscillator has decreased such that it can charge and discharge multiple 
times within the RC time constant of the first relaxation oscillator. 
Not shown in Figure 10-14 are two other regimes. For very large resistances, 
insufficient charge can transfer from the first relaxation oscillator to the second and no 
output spikes are generated. Instead only sub-threshold oscillations occur. Likewise, for 
very small resistances, R2 cannot support sufficient voltage to switch the memristors off 
and a DC output results. 
 
Figure 10-14: Effect of varying the value of resistor R2 on (Left) the output voltage and (Right) the 
voltage across R2. By decreasing the value of R2, chattering and bursting behavior are observed. 
 
The four modes of operation and the resulting voltages across R2 are shown in 
Figure 10-15. A minimum in the voltage across R2 occurs between the spike train and 
bursting modes. Within the spike train mode, a decrease in R2 also decreases the voltage 

 
201 
across R2 creating a stable negative feedback mechanism within the circuit. However, if 
R2 is decreased sufficiently to enter the bursting mode then decreasing R2 increases the 
voltage across R2 creating a potentially unstable positive feedback mechanism. 
Therefore, it is expected that if R2 is replaced with a volatile memristor that 
decreases in resistance with accumulated voltage, similar to the lithium niobite memristor 
simulated in Chapter 9, then the Neuristor will be able to transition from sub-threshold 
swings to spike trains to bursting and finally to a DC output. However, the circuit may be 
unstable in the bursting regime do to positive feedback within circuit. 
 
Figure 10-15: Effect of the value of R2 on the voltage across R2. For large values of R2 insufficient 
charge transfers between the relaxation oscillators and the input pulse is not propagated. Within the 
range of single spike trains, decreasing R2 also decreases the voltage across R2providing a stabilizing 
negative feedback mechanism. Below a threshold value, bursting behavior begins and the voltage 
across R2 increases with decreasing R2 causing potentially unstable positive feedback. For sufficiently 
low values of R2 the relaxation oscillators cannot turn off and a DC output results. 
 

 
202 
An adaptive Neuristor circuit was modelled by replacing R2 with a volatile 
memristor. As shown in Figure 10-16, for a small input current of 5 uA the memristor 
programs slightly, but the Neuristor remains within the spike train mode of operation. 
 
Figure 10-16: Resistance and output voltages for the Neuristor based neuron circuit stimulated with 
a small 5 uA input. The memristor adapts but is stabilized by the negative feedback inherent in the 
circuit. 
 
As shown in Figure 10-17, for a moderate input current of 15 uA the memristor 
begins to program within the spike train mode of operation. However, it passes through 
the threshold resistance entering the bursting mode. Within the bursting mode range the 
resistance decreases further due to the circuit’s positive feedback, but is stabilized by the 
negative feedback of the volatile memristor itself. 

 
203 
 
Figure 10-17: Resistance and output voltages for the Neuristor based neuron circuit stimulated with 
a moderate 15 uA input. The memristor adapts and begins to stabilize, but enters the bursting mode 
causing further resistance change. The memristor is eventually stabilized by the negative feedback 
inherent in the memristor itself in which ion diffusion and drift balance. 
 
As shown in Figure 10-18, for a large input current of 40 uA the memristor 
programs through the spike train mode and the bursting mode eventually reaching the DC 
output mode. Once again the resistance stabilizes due to the negative feedback of the 
volatile memristor itself.  

 
204 
 
Figure 10-18: Resistance and output voltages for the Neuristor based neuron circuit stimulated with 
a large 40 uA input. The memristor adapts passing through the spike train and bursting mode 
regimes and is eventually stabilized by the negative feedback inherent in the memristor itself. 
However, the memristor stabilizes in the DC output regime stopping all spike propagation. 
 
In summary, adaptive behavior was added to the Neuristor circuit by changing 
one resistor to a volatile memristor. Multiple spiking behaviors were added enabling the 
circuit to replicate both individual spikes as well as bursting mode outputs. The transition 
between these spiking behaviors was controlled by the magnitude of the input current 
without adding any other inputs to the circuit. Finally, for very large inputs the circuit 
transitioned into a DC output where all functionality was suppressed.

APPENDIX A 
DENTON DISCOVERY 2 OPERATIONS MANUAL 
This manual consists of 3 sections: 1) a Recipe Writing Guide, 2) Maintenance 
Procedures, and 3) Standard Recipes used in this thesis. In general, the Denton Discovery 
2 software is self-explanatory and intuitive to use. However, there are a few bugs and 
unexpected behaviors that will be indicated at various points within this manual.  
 
 
The main overview page, shown above, allows the user to both run sputter 
deposition recipes and monitor their progress. A typical use of the Denton Discovery 2 
follows these steps: 
1) Log into the tool using the IEN access system 
2) Vent the chamber by pressing the Start Vent button 
Note: The Pressure sensor is not well calibrated for atmospheric pressures and 
the chamber is vented at a pressure of 640 Torr. If the vent process stops before 
this pressure it may be necessary to apply manual force to the chamber lid. 
3) Load your samples and check that each shutter is in the correct position. 

 
206 
4) Pump down the chamber by pressing Start Pumpdown  
5) Write your deposition recipe within the Recipe page 
6) Wait for the chamber to pump down to the desired base pressure 
Note: The system’s base pressure is usually in the mid 10-7 Torr range. Most 
recipes are run after the pressure has reached the 1-3 x 10-6 Torr range, which 
should take 20-30 minutes. 
 
7) Press the Rotostrate Off button to switch the rotostrate on. 
8) Press the Start Recipe button 
9) Wait for the recipe to finish 
10) Vent the chamber, remove your samples, and pump the chamber back down. 
 
Recipe Writing Guide 
 
 Writing a deposition recipe consists of at least 2 setups (Pressure and Power) and 
optionally 2 additional setups (Temperature and Cooling). Within each of these setups 
multiple items can be controlled. For example, within the Pressure Setup the Oxygen 
flow, Argon flow, Nitrogen flow and Pressure set point are controlled. Each of these 
items runs a parallel recipe independent of all other items. It is therefore important when 
programming a recipe to make sure that each item’s recipe totals to the same amount 
of time. The software does not automatically check this and if the times are incorrect the 
deposition will not work as intended. 

 
207 
 
Pressure Setup 
The Pressure Setup allows the user to set the mass flows of oxygen, argon, and 
nitrogen while controlling the chamber pressure. The mass flow controllers allow for 20 
SCCM of oxygen, 100 SCCM of argon, and 50 SCCM of nitrogen. Despite some of the 
labels, each step sets the flow in SCCM, the ramp time in minutes, and the hold time in 
minutes. The second number in each step is a ramp time NOT a ramp rate. 

 
208 
 
 
The chamber pressure is controlled by a throttle valve in front of the turbo pump. 
When choosing a combination of total gas flow and pressure, the chart provided can be 
used to approximate the throttle valve position. The pressure is most controllable when 
the throttle valve position is away from the extremes of 0% (closed) or 100% (open). In 
addition to approximating the throttle valve position, the chart can also be used to 
approximate the mean free path of an atom coming off the sputtering targets.  

 
209 
 
The mean free paths are given by Equation A1 and Equation A2. Equation A1 
describes the mean free path assuming a gas at equilibrium. Equation A2 describes the 
mean free path of a particle with significantly higher energy than the surrounding gas. A 
sputtered atom typically has much higher energy (10’s of eV) than the surrounding gas 
(10’s of meV). However, once it has scattered the sputtered atom will transfer energy to 
the gas and approach equilibrium. 
   
   
√      
Equation A1 
   
   
     
Equation A2 
λ is the mean free path, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, d is the 
diameter of the gaseous atoms, and P is pressure. For the mean free paths given in the 
chart, an atomic diameter of 300 pm was chosen as an approximate atomic diameter. 

 
210 
Argon has a covalent diameter of 212 pm and a Van der Waal diameter of 376 pm. 
Niobium has an atomic diameter of 292 pm. 
 
When writing the Pressure Setup for a recipe, it is important to “strike” the targets 
at high pressure before lowering the pressure to the desired deposition pressure. For DC 
plasmas, the breakdown voltage is given by Paschen’s Curve shown in below. While this 
curve is not directly applicable to a sputtering magnetron, the theory is generally 
applicable that too low of a pressure or too short of a target shutter distance will prevent 
the plasma from forming. 
 
 
When setting the chamber pressure it should be noted that the throttle valve 
control seems to accept a margin of error of approximately ±0.5 mTorr. For example, 

 
211 
when lowering the pressure from the 50 mTorr striking pressure to 1 mTorr operation 
pressure, the system often stabilizes at approximately 1.4 mTorr. 
Power Setup 
 
The Power Setup allows the user to set the applied power to the Left Gun, Center 
Gun, Right Gun, and Platen. The Left Gun, Center Gun, and Platen are attached to RF 
power supplies while the Right Gun is attached to a DC power supply. Each item’s recipe 
sets the power in Watts, the ramp time in minutes, and the hold time in minutes. The 
second number in each step is a ramp time NOT a ramp rate.  
 
 
The Power Setup is perhaps the most difficult task when writing a recipe due to 
several bugs and non-idealities. 1) The last hold in each recipe cannot be zero. For some 
reason the software will skip the last step in a recipe if it ends in “hold for 0 minutes”. As 
the last step is usually ramping down the target power, this will crash the target possibly 
causing it to crack. 2) There is an offset between the Right Gun power set point and the 
actual applied power. The applied power is consistently 11 W lower than the set point. 3) 

 
212 
The Center Gun tuning network is broken. In order to use the Center Gun, an RF 
extension cable must be run from the Left Gun. The recipe must then be written to power 
the Left Gun (which is now physically connected to the Center Gun) but to open the 
Center Gun Shutter. An example recipe that does this procedure is the Cr/Cr2O3 
deposition recipe provided. 
Temperature Setup 
 
The Temperature Setup is on the Recipe page and the main Overview page. The 
Recipe page allows the user to turn the heater on or off, set a temperature, set a minimum 
pressure before the deposition begins, and set whether the heater will turn off after the 
deposition is complete. The Overview page allows the user to set the heater’s ramp 
parameters.  
 

 
213 
The platen temperature is controlled by pulse width modulation of the heat lamps. 
The default temperature controller is an adaptive PID controller that is very stable, but is 
slow to reach high temperatures. Therefore, the parameters on the Overview page allow 
the user to bypass the default controller and set a constant % pulse width that will be 
applied if the temperature is below a set % of the temperature set point. When the 
temperature is above the set % of the temperature set point the default PID controller 
once again takes over. As shown, this two-step control scheme allows the system to reach 
high temperatures much faster than with the default PID controller alone. 
 
Despite the temperature shielding that surrounds the high power IR lamps, the 
entire chamber heats up during a high temperature deposition. This can increase the 
temperature of the cryo-pump arrays causing them to outgas raising the system pressure. 
For platen temperatures above 600 oC the cryo-pump gate valve should be closed. 
Cooling Setup 
 
Cooling down from a high temperature deposition can take up to 8 hours if natural 
radiation and conduction are the only heat transfer mechanisms. Therefore, the user may 
choose to purge the chamber with gas using the Cooling Setup. The forced cooling is a 
two-step procedure. 

 
214 
 
The first step is intended for high temperatures when the deposited film may react 
with any introduced gasses. The chamber is purged with a constant flow of Argon at a 
fairly low pressure so that the chamber pressure is still within the operating range of the 
turbo pump. The second step is intended for lower temperatures where radiation is no 
longer the dominant heat transfer mechanism. The chamber is purged with nitrogen to a 
high pressure which absorbs some heat from the chamber. The chamber is then pumped 
back down using the rough pump removing the heated gas. 
It should be noted that it is possible to have forced cooling while leaving the 
heaters on after the deposition has finished. It is unknown what effect this will have on 
the system. 
Maintenance Procedures 
 
The following section describes several maintenance procedures for the Denton 
Discovery 2 including both common and uncommon tasks. In the order that they appear 
the procedures are: 

 
215 
- 
Chamber Cleaning 
- 
Cathode Disassembly / Target Replacement 
- 
Replacing the Heat Lamps 
- 
Cryo-Pump Regeneration 
- 
Long-term Shutdown 
Chamber Cleaning 
 
By far the most common maintenance procedure is chamber cleaning. Sputter 
deposition builds up thick layers on the cathode shutters, cathode dark shields, and the 
sample platen. If these parts are not regularly cleaned the built up material tends to flake 
and fall onto the platen and wafers. In extreme cases build up on the dark shields can 
cause a target short potentially damaging the target. 
 
The following instructions apply only to the Left and Right directly cooled 
targets. To remove the shutters use a 3/32” hex key to loosen the shutter clamps and slide 
the shutters off of the shutter rods. To remove the dark shields use the same 3/32” hex 
key to loosen the three screws around top of each dark shield and slide the dark shields 
forward off of the targets. To remove the platen remove the center bolt using a 3/16” hex 
key and lift the platen out of the chamber. The Center target’s shutter can be removed by 
loosening the set screw and sliding the shutter off of the shutter rod. The dark shield and 
target clamp can be removed by unscrewing them from the target body. Any films that 
have built up on these parts can be removed with a bead blaster. Use of a sand blaster is 
not recommended as it will damage the metal surfaces, increase roughness, and impede 
chamber pump down. 
Cathode Disassembly / Changing Targets 

 
216 
 
To replace the directly cooled targets on the Right and Left cathodes, the entire 
cathode must be disassembled. Turn off all power supplies and disconnect the power 
cables before opening a sputtering cathode.  
1. Turn off the water supply to the cathode and drain the water lines into a bucket. 
2. Vent the chamber 
3. Remove the top cover held in place by three set screws 
4. Disconnect the internal water connections (1/4” swage) 
5. Use a large adjustable wrench to loosen the large nut. This nut clamps the water 
cooling block against an o-ring inside the chamber. As you loosen the nut the 
cooling block will move toward the platen. 
6. Use a 3/32” hex key to loosen the 12 screws along the back edge of the water 
cooling block. 
7. Use a thin pry bar (combination of razors and small screw drivers) to slowly 
remove the cooling block and target from the cathode. 
Replacing the Heat Lamps 
 
Before performing maintenance on the heating system, disconnect power to the 
heat lamps by pulling the fuses in the back of the system.  
In order to replace the heat lamps, first remove the platen (3/16” hex key) and 
chamber shield (1/4” wrench) to expose the heat shield box. Next, remove the shim stock 
that has been inserted around the edges of the heat shield box. Next, lift the top sections 
of the box off revealing the IR heat lamps and lamp reflectors. 
The IR lamps are held in place by terminal blocks and once accessed can be easily 
replaced.

Cryo-Pump Regeneration 
 
The cryo-pump has an onboard controller that is used to regenerate the pump. 
However, the cryo-pump and turbo pump share the same rough pump. Therefore, before 
regenerating the cryo-pump the gate valve between the turbo pump and chamber 
should be closed and the turbo pump should be spun down to avoid a full speed crash 
of the turbo pump. This procedure requires administrator level control to manually 
actuate the gate valves. 
1) Close the gate valve between the cryo-pump and chamber. 
2) Close the gate valve between the turbo pump and chamber. 
3) Spin down the turbo pump. 
4) Use the on-board controller to regenerate the cryo-pump. 
5) Wait until the cryo-pump has begun cooling down again. 
6) Open the gate valve between the turbo pump and chamber. This will rough out the 
chamber through the turbo pump. 
7) Open the gate valve between the cryo-pump and chamber. 
8) Spin the turbo pump back up. 
Note: allowing the cryo pump to cool down while being actively pumped by the turbo 
is an unusual procedure compared to most cryo-pump regeneration procedures. However, 
it will not harm the system and allows the operator to return the system to automatic 
controls earlier than waiting for the cryo-pump to cool down. 
Long-term Shutdown 
 
If the cleanroom is going to be abandoned for an extended period of time, such as 
during winter break, the Discovery 2 should be placed in a safe state in case of power 

 
218 
outage, water outage, or other unforeseen event. This procedure requires administrator 
level control to manually actuate the gate valves. 
1) Close the gate valve between the turbo pump and chamber. 
2) Spin down the turbo pump. 
3) Turn off all of the source power supplies.

APPENDIX B 
NEUROPHYSIOLOGY FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS 
The neuron model discussed in this thesis is simplistic compared to a biological 
neuron. The necessity of this simplification is due to the need to create structural 
primitives from which more advanced work can progress. This appendix will provide a 
brief overview of some neural complexities that were either mentioned briefly in the 
main thesis or skipped over entirely. 
Effect of Cell Morphology 
In Chapter 1 it was briefly stated that the structure of the dendritic tree affects 
spike propagation and synaptic learning. Dendrites are fundamentally transmission lines 
described by distributed elements of internal resistance, membrane resistance, and 
membrane capacitance [186]. The physical size and shape of the dendrites determines the 
values for these circuit elements and thus determines the effective propagation distance 
and filtering properties of the dendritic tree [22]. In some neuron morphologies it is 
possible to have a synapse far enough away from the cell body to never impact the 
integrated charge because any input action potentials are suppressed and filtered before 
they arrive at the cell body [186]. 
However, in addition to passive cable propagation, dendrites often express 
voltage-gated ion channels similar to the axon, although typically with a lower density 
than is observed in an axon [187]. The low density of voltage-gated ion channels allow 
for some active action potential regeneration, but not sufficient regeneration to cancel the 
effects of passive cable filtering. This low level regeneration allows single action 

 
230 
potentials to propagate efficiently, but suppresses high frequency bursts or trains of 
action potentials [22].  
In addition to affecting action potential propagation, the dendritic structure also 
affects memory and learning. As discussed in Chapter 5, one of the primary learning 
mechanisms in neural systems is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in which the 
relative timing of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic action potentials determines the change 
in synaptic conduction. This model of neural learning has been experimentally 
demonstrated [188], but requires the ability to back-propagate action potentials through 
the dendritic tree to reach the synapses. Neurons with few branches in their dendritic 
trees can back-propagate action potentials fairly reliably, but other neurons such as 
Purkinje cells have extensively branched dendritic trees that unreliably back-propagate 
action potentials [187]. 
Another effect of cell morphology is the temporal and spatial summation of the 
dendritic tree. The complex geometrical structure a dendritic tree creates complex 
filtering and attenuation functions by combining thousands of synaptic inputs at different 
locations through the branches of the dendritic tree. It has been shown that synaptic 
inputs that are in close physical proximity and fire closely in time exhibit sub-linear 
summation rather than the linear summation from physically or temporally distant 
synapses [186]. 
Finally, the cell morphology described in Chapter 1, synapses  dendrites  
soma  axon hillock  axon, includes all of the major cellular sub-structures. However, 
not all neurons include every sub-structure. For example, the starburst neuron located in 
the retina does not have an axon or axon hillock and the soma is thought to play 

 
231 
essentially no role in processing information. Instead, the star burst neuron has several 
sets of isolated semi-independent dendritic trees that receive inputs along their periphery 
and send outputs from their central portions. This cell morphology is thought to play a 
role in our ability to sense the direction of motion [16]. 
Advanced Hodgkin-Hukley Model 
The Hodgkin-Hukley model of an axon shown in Figure 1-3 has been modified 
since its original conception to include more complex cellular structures and behaviors. 
Perhaps the most significant modification is the addition of a parallel current source 
representing the Na+-K+ ATPase pumps that exchange sodium and potassium ions across 
the cell membrane maintaining the equilibrium concentrations. These pumps were not 
discovered until 1957, 5 years after the original Hodgkin-Huxley model was proposed 
[189]. One estimate of neural energy consumption predicts that ATPase pumps 
maintaining the neuron’s resting potential use more than half of the neuron’s power 
consumption [190] making them an important structure for creating an artificial neuron. 
In addition to the discovery of ATPase pumps, multiple new ion channels and ion 
channel characteristics have been discovered since the original Hodgkin-Huxley model 
was published in 1952. Examples include Ca2+ ion channels and Cl- ion channels thought 
to have wide ranging regulatory functionalities including regulation of the neuron’s 
electrical excitability [191]. While the ionic basis for such regulatory behavior was not 
explicitly stated in Chapter 10, it is modelled in both the adaptive Schmitt Trigger 
displaying spike-frequency adaptation and the adaptive Neuristor displaying transitions to 
bursting behavior. 

 
232 
In addition to ion channels not captured in the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, 
approximately 40 genes encode potassium channels suggesting a wide variety of possible 
ion channels with varying dynamics [192]. The impact of these varying ion channel 
dynamics is still not well understood. 
Stochastic Nature of Neural Computation 
The Hodgkin-Huxley model is fundamentally a deterministic system. However, 
biological neurons are subject to stochastic processes such as thermodynamic 
fluctuations, ion channel noise, and synaptic noise [193]. Multiple modifications to the 
Hodgkin-Huxley model have been proposed to account for thermodynamic [194] and 
other stochastic process [193]. The stochastic nature of memristors has also been 
modelled for reproducing stochastic behavior in neuromorphic circuitry [195]. 
The Self-Organizing Brain 
One aspect of neurobiology that is often overlooked in the discussion of 
neuromorphic computing architectures is the fact that the brain is a self-organizing 
system rather than a genetically specified design. Estimates of the human genome place 
the number of genes between 20,000 – 25,000, not nearly enough to deterministically 
specify the 1012 neurons each with 103 – 104 synaptic connections. Therefore, 
environmental factors also likely contribute to the brain’s development. 
The self-organizing nature of the brain directly contrasts with modern CMOS 
processors that are fully specified before fabrication. While it is unknown how these 
differing design philosophies affect the system’s design and optimization, it is an aspect 
of neurobiology that has only recently been considered for neuromorphic circuitry with 
the advent of memristor enabled reconfigurable circuitry [196]. 
 

 
233 
APPENDIX C 
CLASSES OF MEMRISTORS 
 
The memristor was first proposed as the fourth fundamental two-terminal passive 
circuit element by Leon Chua in 1971 [47]. The primary argument for the inclusion of the 
memristor was a matter of symmetry. There are four fundamental quantities when 
considering the passive circuit elements: charge (q), current (I), voltage (V), and flux-
linkage (ϕ). These four quantities can be related to each other in six ways, shown in 
Equations 2.1a-f. The relations between charge to current and voltage to flux-linkage are 
fundamental definitions. Three of the remaining four relations describe the well-known 
passive devices: a resistor (voltage to current), a capacitor (charge to voltage), and an 
inductor (flux-linkage to current). Chua’s 1971 paper theorized a fourth device that 
would relate flux-linkage and charge. A theoretical development of this relationship 
revealed that the device would act like a variable resistor with memory of its input. Thus 
the name memristor was given [47].

In 1976, Chua expanded the memristor definition to include a class of devices 
termed memristive systems [26]. These devices are described by a set of dynamic 
relations, shown in Equations 2.2a-b, that include the original memristor definition but 
allow for more complex behavior such as multiple inputs,  ⃗ , multiple outputs,   , and 

 
234 
multiple internal mechanisms described by the state variables,   , allowing for threshold 
voltages and volatile behavior.

    ( ⃑  ⃗⃑  ) 
Equation 2.2b 
 
These additional behaviors are important for physical devices because no physical 
implementation of a memristor has been shown to follow the more restrictive 1971 
definition. While memristors were first theorized in 1971 and first experimentally 
reported in 2008, a review of historical devices reveals memristive behavior in a wide 
range of devices including tungsten filament lamps, vapor discharge tubes, and 
thermistors [60]. The following sub-sections summarize a few of the major classes of 
memristors that have received attention since the 2008 publication reintroduced 
memristors to the research community. Other memristor summaries have been tabulated 
elsewhere including comparisons of switching speed, retention time, and endurance [70]. 
Filamentary Memristors 
 
The filamentary memristor was first published by HP labs in 2008 [46], although 
filamentary resistive switching devices were published and well characterized before this 
[62]. Fundamentally these devices operate by the creation and destruction of a conducting 
filament through an otherwise insulating material. When the filament connects the 
electrodes together a low resistance state exists and when the filament is broken a high 
resistance state exists. The formation of the filament requires the motion of mobile ions 
such as oxygen anions in TiO2 [46], NiO [48], WOx [49], TaOx [50], or NbOx [51], or 
metal cations in Ag2S or GeSe [62]. While these devices are typically binary, careful 

 
235 
control of timing and compliance currents can program analog resistance states by 
controlling the distance between the filament edge and one electrode [72]. 
 
Filamentary memristors can be further divided into unipolar and bipolar devices. 
Unipolar devices are capable of switching when a voltage of either polarity is applied. 
Filament formation occurs at a fairly low voltage while filament destruction occurs at a 
higher voltage. These devices are often compared to a nano-scale fuse [62]. In contrast, 
bipolar filamentary memristors require voltages of opposite polarities to switch between 
the high and low resistance states by electrically drifting the mobile ions in each 
direction.  
 
Filamentary memristors are typically not manufactured with the filaments 
preformed and filaments must by initialized by an electroforming process. This process 
requires higher voltage and current than normal operation and has been shown to cause 
electrode damage in switchable oxides as mobile oxygen bursts through the electrode [66, 
67]. In addition to the filament formation, filamentary memristor operation creates 
extreme thermal and electrical conditions. It is estimated that a switching memristor 
produces power densities on the order of 1012 W/cm3 [62] reaching temperatures of 800 
K [69] and electric fields above 106 V/cm [68]. 
Mobile Ion Wavefront Memristors 
 
While filamentary memristors can be considered one geometry of mixed ion-
electron conducting (MIEC) memristors, another geometry is the mobile ion wave front 
memristor. This geometry is similar to the bipolar switching filamentary memristor, but 
no filament is formed. Instead, mobile dopants move throughout a host lattice creating 
regions of highly doped and semi-insulating material. 

 
236 
 
One example of this geometry is the cosputtered Ag/Si memristor in which the 
conduction front is created by introducing the dopant silver part of the way into a silicon 
deposition. This eliminates the need for electroforming as the device is fully formed 
during fabrication [63]. Mobile ion wave front devices have demonstrated nearly analog 
switching, but have not been demonstrated with as wide a dynamic range (RON / ROFF) as 
filamentary memristors. The LiNbO2 memristors examined in this thesis fall into this 
category. 
Oxidation/Reduction Memristors 
 
While memristors were originally defined as two terminal devices [47], the 
memristive system definition allows for multiport systems [26]. Such memristive systems 
have been demonstrated in mobile ion systems in which the mobile ions are allowed to 
leave the memristive material through a gated electrolyte. This three terminal transistor 
structure results in the oxidation or reduction of the active material changing the 
conductance between the source and drain terminals. Experimental examples of this 
structure include the oxidation/reduction of organic materials [58] and the lithiation of 
inorganic battery cathodes [57]. These three terminal devices are important for 
neuromorphic applications because many biological models include batteries with 
variable resistance [25] and the biological synapse is fundamentally a three terminal 
device – involving the presynaptic neuron, the post-synaptic neuron, and the intracellular 
fluid – although it is often replaced by two terminal memristors in neuromorphic circuits. 
Spintronic Memristors 
 
While mobile ion-electron conducting memristors modify the electron 
conductivity either with doping or phase transitions, memristive effects have also been 

 
237 
observed in materials where resistance modulation and memory are provided by a degree 
of freedom other than mobile ions. One such system is the broad class of spintronic 
devices where electron transport is sensitive to the electron-spin polarization, which can 
be changed by an externally applied voltage [54]. By controlling the ferromagnetic 
polarization of a free polarization layer compared to a reference polarization layer across 
a tunneling junction, the current flow through the tunnel junction can be controlled [55]. 
Many of these devices can also be switched by an external magnetic field [56] making 
them multi-input devices best described by the memristive system formalism. 
Ferroelectric Switches 
 
Similar to the spintronic memristors are ferroelectric memristors where device 
resistance is controlled by the ferroelectric polarization near a tunnel barrier. For 
nanoscale devices with small domains, a nearly continuous range of resistances can be 
achieved [65]. 
Mott Metal-Insulator Switches 
 
In addition to ion motion, magnetic polarization, and electric polarization, thermal 
energy can provide a degree of freedom capable of producing memristive behavior. In 
materials with a Mott metal-insulator transition, joule heating has been demonstrated to 
produce memristive effects. When sufficient voltage is applied to heat the device above 
the metal-insulator transition temperature, the device switches to a conducting state. The 
conducting state (higher current) dissipates more power, requiring a lower voltage to 
switch back to the insulating state [23]. Later work demonstrated that the internal 
temperature was not high enough to cause the metal-insulator transition and that the 

 
238 
memristive hysteresis was caused by smaller temperature changes modifying a Poole-
Frenkel current [170].
