Complex networks from classical to quantum
Jacob Biamonte
1, Mauro Faccin2 & Manlio De Domenico3
Recent progress in applying complex network theory to problems in quantum information has
resulted in a beneﬁcial cross-over. Complex network methods have successfully been applied
to transport and entanglement models while information physics is setting the stage for a
theory of complex systems with quantum information-inspired methods. Novel quantum
induced effects have been predicted in random graphs—where edges represent entangled
links—and quantum computer algorithms have been proposed to offer enhancement for
several network problems. Here we review the results at the cutting edge, pinpointing the
similarities and the differences found at the intersection of these two ﬁelds.
Q
uantum mechanics has long been predicted to help solve computational problems in
physics1, chemistry2, and machine learning3 and to offer quantum security enhancement
in communications4, including a quantum secure Internet5. Rapid experimental pro-
gress has pushed quantum computing and communication devices into truly data-intensive
domains, where even the classical network describing a quantum system can exhibit complex
features, giving rise to what appears as a paradigm shift needed to face a fundamental type of
complexity6–13. Methods originating in complex networks—traditionally based on statistical
mechanics—are now being generalized to the quantum domain in order to address these new
quantum complexity challenges.
Building on several fundamental discoveries14,15, complex network theory has demonstrated
that many (non-quantum) systems exhibit similarities in their complex features14–18, in the
organization of their structure and dynamics19–24, the controllability of their constituents25, and
their resilience to structural and dynamical perturbations26–31. Certain quantum systems have
been shown to indeed exhibit complex features related to classical systems, as well as novel
mechanisms and principles that interrelate complex features in quantum systems6–12,32.
Two types of quantum networks have been of primary focus in the series of pioneering results
we review. The ﬁrst consists of quantum systems whose connections are represented by
entangled states6,33,34. These quantum networks are used in secure quantum communication
systems. The second area of focus consists of networks of quantum systems, such as atoms or
superconducting quantum electronics, whose connections are physical35–40. Such systems are
used to develop quantum-enhanced algorithms or quantum information transport systems, both
modeled by quantum walks on complex networks. At a fundamental level, the two types of

quantum networks are described by quantum information theory,
allowing one to extend the spectrum of network descriptors—
such as ranking indicators, similarity, and correlation measures—
inside the quantum domain.
Interestingly, the same tools can then be appropriately mod-
iﬁed to apply to traditional complex networks, suggesting the
existence of a framework—network information theory—suitable
for application to both classical and quantum networked
systems32,41,42. This bidirectional cross-over is carving out a
coherent path forward built fundamentally on the intersection of
these two ﬁelds (see Box. 1). Several quantum effects are still
outside of the predictive range of applicability of complex net-
work theory. Future work should build on recent breakthroughs
and head toward a new theory of complex networks, which
augments the current statistical mechanics approach to complex
networks, with a theory built fundamentally on quantum
mechanics. Such a uniﬁed path forward appears to be through the
language of information theory.
Here, we make an effort to review some of the crucial steps
toward the creation of a network theory based fundamentally on
quantum effects. Therefore, we do not cover several topics that,
nevertheless, deserve to be mentioned as part of the ﬁeld. These
include, in no particular order, quantum gravity theories based on
complex networks43–46, synchronization in and on quantum
networks47, quantum random circuits48,49, classical spin models,
and quantum statistics successfully used in complex network
theory50–52 (see ref. 53 for a thorough review).
Networks in quantum physics vs complexity
Network and graph theory fundamentally arises in nearly all
aspects of quantum information and computation. As is the case
with traditional network science, not all networks exhibit what is
considered as “complexity”. Here, we will recall brieﬂy the basic
deﬁnition of a network and mention several areas where network
theory arises in quantum computation and contrast this with the
concept of a complex network.
A network is an abstract representation of relationships
(encoded by edges) between units (encoded by nodes) of a
complex system. Edges can be directed, i.e., they can represent
information incoming to or outgoing from a node and, in general,
they can be weighted by real numbers. The number of incoming,
outgoing, and total edges is known as incoming, outgoing, and
total degree of a node, respectively. The sum of the corresponding
weights deﬁnes the incoming, outgoing, and total strength of that
node, respectively. Networks are often characterized by how node
degree and strength are distributed and correlated. Systems
modeled by uncorrelated networks with homogeneous degree
distribution are known as Erdos–Renyi networks, whereas sys-
tems with power-law degree distribution are known as scale-free
networks. We refer to refs. 16,54 for reviews of network concepts
and models.
The use of various aspects of graph and network theory can be
found in all aspects of quantum theory, yet not all networks are
complex.
The
commonly
considered
networks
include
(i)
Quantum spins arranged on graphs; (ii) quantum random walks
on graphs; (iii) Quantum circuits/networks; (iv) Superconducting
quantum (electrical) circuits; (v) Tensor network states; (vi)
Quantum graph states, etc. Although the idea of a complex net-
work is not deﬁned in a strict sense, the deﬁnition is typically that
of a network that exhibits an emergent property, such as a non-
trivial distribution in node degree. This is in contrast to graph
theory, which applies graph theory or tensor network reasoning

to deduce and determine properties of quantum systems. Here,
we will focus on topics in quantum systems that are known to be
connected with the same sort of complexity considered in com-
plex networks.
Quantum networks based on entangled states
To deﬁne quantum networks based on entangled states, let us
start from the state of each ith qubit, written without loss of
generality, as
ψi


¼ cosðαiÞ 0j i þ eiθisinðαIÞ 1j i;
ð1Þ
with |0〉and |1〉the preferred or “computational” basis. The qubit
is in a pure, coherent superposition of the two basis states and any
measurement in this same basis will cause the state to collapse
onto |0〉or |1〉, with probability cos2(αi) and sin2(αI), respectively.
Let us consider a quantum system with two qubits, i.e., i = 1 and
2. The basis of this system is given by the so called, tensor pro-
duct, of the two basis states: |00〉, |01〉, |10〉, and |11〉. If the two
qubits are not entangled, i.e., their states are independent from
each other, then the state of the overall system can be written as
e.g., |ψ12〉= |ψ1〉⊗|ψ2〉, whereas this is not possible if the two
qubits are entangled. A generalization of this description to the
case of mixed states is obtained in terms of the non-negative
density matrix ρ; a unit trace Hermitian operator representing the
state of the system as an ensemble of (unknown) pure states.
Instead of distributing entanglement on regular graphs, such as
uniform lattices typically studied in condensed matter physics, it
has been shown that it is possible to tune the amount of entan-
glement between two nodes in such a way that it equals the
probability to have a link in (classical) Erdos–Renyi graphs6. Such
random graphs can be deﬁned by the family of networks G(N, p),
where N is the number of nodes and p the probability to ﬁnd a
link between any two nodes. The probability scales with the size
of the network following a power law p ∝N−z, with z ≥0. In
classical network theory, there exists a critical value for the
probability pc(N) for which, if p > pc(N) a given subgraph of n
nodes and l links has higher probability to be observed. The
classical result is that this critical probability scales with N as
pc(N) ∝N−n/l.
Acin, Cirac, and Lewenstein6 formulated an elegant extension
of this picture to the quantum realm by replacing each link with
an entangled pair of particles, where the probability pi,j = p that
the link exists between nodes i and j is substituted by a quantum
state ρi,j: = ρ of two qubits, one at each node (see Fig. 1). One can
build a quantum network where each node consists of N −1
qubits, which are entangled, in pairs, with qubits of other nodes.
However, in this case, although the connections are identical and
pure they encode non-maximally entangled pairs. For pure states
of qubits the density matrix is ρ = |ϕ〉〈ϕ|, with

Here, 0 ≤p ≤1 quantiﬁes the entanglement of links and the
state of the overall quantum random graph can be denoted by |G
(N, p)〉. If each link, i.e., each entangled pair, attempts to convert
its state to the maximally entangled one (p = 1/2) through local
operations and classical communication (LOCC), the optimal
probability of successful conversion is exactly p. It follows that the
fraction of existing entangled states converted to maximally
entangled ones by LOCC corresponds to the probability of having
a link between nodes in the corresponding classical random
network6. By varying the value of the parameter z, i.e., how the
critical probability scales with system size, it is possible to control
the number and type of subgraphs present in a quantum network
of N nodes. This is useful to create special multipartite states, such
as the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state, which exhibits non-
classical correlations55. The striking result is that it is possible to
obtain, with probability approaching unity, a quantum state with
the topology of any ﬁnite subgraph for N approaching inﬁnity
and z = −2.
This bridge between complex network theory and quantum
theory provides a powerful tool to investigate the critical prop-
erties of a quantum system. For instance, in the case of regular
lattices, it has been shown that the probability popt to establish a
perfect quantum channel between the nodes can be mapped to the
probability of distributing links among each pair of nodes in the
lattice6, a scenario that can be studied using the well-established
bond-percolation theory from statistical physics. This result allows
one to calculate the critical probability above which the system will
exhibit an inﬁnite connected cluster and, in the case of qubits, it
has been shown that the probability of having an entangled path
with inﬁnite length—i.e., an inﬁnite sequence of entangled states
connecting an inﬁnite number of qubits—is unity. However, for
product states this probability is zero, denoting the existence of a
sharp transition between these two scenarios. However, local
measurements based on this approach, called classical entangle-
ment percolation (CEP), are not optimal, in general, to generate
maximally entangled states: CEP is not even asymptotically opti-
mal for two-dimensional lattices and new quantum protocols
based on quantum entanglement percolation have to be used
instead6. A novel critical phenomenon, deﬁning an entanglement
phase transition, emerges from this new strategy, where the critical
parameter is the degree of entanglement required to be distributed
in order to establish a quantum channel with probability that does
not decay exponentially with the size of the system, at variance
with CEP. This type of enhancement with respect to the classical
case has been reported for different network topologies, such as
Erdos–Renyi, scale-free, and small-world networks33.
Unexpected quantum effects emerging from network effects
have been reported. Cardillo et al.56 Show that nodes that store
the largest amount of information are the ones with intermediate
connectivity and not the hubs, breaking down the usual hier-
archical picture of classical networks. More recently, Carvacho
et al.57 measured the emergence of special quantum correlations,
named non-bilocal, correlating distant qubits by means of several
intermediate, typically independent, sources, and providing evi-
dence for violation of local causality in a quantum network.
The static entangled states providing the network connectivity
described here, will be replaced in the next section by dynamical
processes on networked quantum systems.
Quantum networks based on physical connectivity
Another wide area where network concepts have found applic-
ability consists of quantum systems physically interconnected,
such as atoms or superconducting quantum electronics35–40.
These types of systems provide fertile ground where quantum

algorithms are tested58–62 and quantum information transport
systems are studied63–65. Typical modeling approaches are based
on so called “quantum walks” on complex networks, with recent
studies showing that quantum information tasks, typically
designed for simple topologies, retain performance in very dis-
ordered structures66. Stochastic (non-quantum) walks are also a
central model in complex network theory—see the review67.
Any quantum process can be viewed as a single-particle walk on
a graph. Single-particle quantum walks represent a universal
model of quantum computation—meaning that any algorithm for
a quantum computer can be translated into a quantum walk on a
graph—and, in addition, quantum walks have been widely studied
in the realm of quantum search on graphs, in both continuous and
discrete time via coined walks (see e.g.,58–61 in particular, the
graph optimality results66). The computational advantages of
quantum versus stochastic random walk based algorithms has
attracted wide interest with typical focus being on general graphs,
which consequently do not exhibit complex features. However,
many works have compared properties of stochastic68,69 and
quantum random walks63–65 on complex networks70.
Network topology has further been shown as a means to direct
transport by adding complex numbers—while maintaining Her-
miticity—to the networks adjacency matrix in “chiral quantum
walks”65,71,72 (note that chiral walks were realized experimentally
in ref. 12). Open system walks which mix stochastic and quantum
effects in ‘open’ evolutions64 have aided in the study of quantum
effects in biological exciton transport (again, modeled as a
quantum walk) and developments in a quantum version of
Google’s Page-Rank8–10 has been seen, providing a practical
solution to overcome the degeneracy issues affecting the classical
version and enhancing node ranking in large networks. Recently,
Faccin et al. have analytically solved a model that shed light on
some key differences between stochastic and quantum walks on
complex networks7. These differences push forward a general
understanding which can lead to a theory explaining novel
complex features in quantum systems.
Quantum walks on complex networks represent both a practical
model of transport70 as well as an interesting stage of comparison
between the quantum and stochastic cases. As a closed quantum
system exhibits ﬂuctuations in the probabilities in time, typically a
long time average is considered. Physically, this is the best
approximation one can hope for, provided that there is no
knowledge of when the walk started. In this case, the probability to
ﬁnd a quantum walker in the ith node is given by

Quantum-enhanced page-ranking. The non-symmetric adja-
cency matrix
representing
the directed
connectivity of
the
World Wide Web, a.k.a. the Google matrix G, satisﬁes the
Perron–Frobenius theorem73 and hence there is a maximal
eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenvector of positive entries Gp =
p. The eigenvector p corresponds to the limiting distribution
of occupation probabilities of a random web surfer—it represents a
unique attractor for the dynamics independently of the initial state.
The
vector
p
is
known
as
the
Page-Rank.
A
dumping
or teleportation factor is often included in the computation in order
to assure the Perron–Frobenius theorem satisfactibility.
Several recent studies embed G into a quantum system and
consider quantum versions of Google’s Page-Rank8–10. Garner-
one et al.74 relied on an adiabatic quantum algorithm to compute
the Page-Rank of a given directed network, whereas Burillo
et al.11 rely on a mixture of unitary and dissipative evolution to
deﬁne a ranking that converges faster than classical Page-Rank.
The page-ranking vector ~p is an eigenvector of I  G
corresponding to the zero eigenvalue (the lowest). This fact leads
to a deﬁnition of a Hermitian operator which can play the role of
a Hamiltonian, deﬁned as:
hp ¼ ðI  GÞyðI  GÞ;
ð5Þ
though highly non-local, its ground state represents the target
Page-Rank,
which
could
be found
by adiabatic
quantum
annealing into the ground state. Using a quantum computer to
accelerate the calculation of various network properties has been
considered widely58–61. As Page-Rank relies on ﬁnding the vector
corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue of the Google matrix, the
adiabatic algorithm opens the door up to accelerate network
calculations using quantum computers.
Directing transport by symmetry breaking in chiral walks.
Chiral quantum walks, introduced by Zimborás et al. in ref. 65
and realized experimentally in ref. 12, append complex numbers
to the adjacency matrix (playing the role of the system Hamil-
tonian) while still maintaining the Hermitian property12,65,71,72.
These complex phases in many cases do not affect transfer
probabilities: the theory explaining this ﬁnding was developed
in refs. 12,65, without relying on approximations or averaging.
The case of open systems has been investigated as well in ref. 65.
In
the
scenarios
where
the
addition
of
complex
phases
affects transfer probabilities, the underlying system breaks time-
reversal symmetry and, consequently, the probability ﬂow
into the quantum system is biased. This fact enables directed
state transfer without requiring a biased (or non-local) distribu-
tion in the initial states, or coupling to an environment.
When the underlying graph is bipartite (e.g., a graph whose
vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such as a square
lattice), time-reversal symmetry in the transport probabilities
cannot be broken. Transport suppression is indeed possible
however65. Bipartite graphs include trees, linear chains and
generally, graphs with only even cycles. These results point to a
subtle interplay between the topology of the underlying graph,
giving rise to a new challenge for dynamical control of probability
transfer when considering walks on complex networks12,65,71,72.
Open quantum walks. The area of open quantum systems75
studies noise and its effects in quantum systems. The adiabatic
version of Page-Rank9 uses a quantum stochastic quantum walk
as proposed by64 (see also refs. 76,77 for studies on open walks).
Quantum stochastic walks are deﬁned by a quantum walk
undergoing dissipative dynamics. The latter follows the quantum

we revert to the stochastic case.
The authors8,10,11 show how this deﬁnition of quantum Page-

certain values of α, the algorithm exhibits faster convergence.
Towards uniﬁed analysis of network complexity
The interaction between network science and quantum infor-
mation science has led to the development of theoretical and
computational tools that beneﬁtted from both ﬁelds. On the one
hand, quantum-inspired tools, such as information entropies and
quantum distance measures, have been successfully applied to
practical problems concerning classical complex networks32. On
the other hand, classical network descriptors have been ported to
the quantum realm to gain better insights about the structure and
the dynamics of networked quantum systems13. The cross-
pollination between the two ﬁelds—including, among others,
quantum statistics for modeling the dynamics of classical net-
works and their geometry79,80 (see also ref. 81 and references
therein)—is still ongoing with vibrant future research opportu-
nities. Here, we brieﬂy review the advances concerning quantum-
inspired entropic measures for networks and network-inspired
measures for quantum systems.
Information entropy of classical networks. Historically, the
concept of entropy has been successfully used to quantify the
complexity of many systems82,83. Recently, the possibility of using
quantum entropy and other quantum information theoretical
measures has been explored by the community of network
scientists.
For classical complex networks, von Neumann’s entropy has been
applied over one decade ago84. The combinatorial Laplacian matrix
L, obtained from the adjacency matrix representing the network, is
rescaled by the number of edges in the network. The normalization
of the matrix L guarantees that the corresponding eigenvalues are
non-negative and sum up to 1—in order to be interpreted as
probabilities85—and some other properties, which makes the
resulting object similar to a quantum density matrix ρ. Network
entropy is deﬁned according to von Neumann quantum entropy as
SðρÞ ¼ Trðρ log2 ρÞ:
ð12Þ
By exploiting the eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix,
it can be shown that this entropy corresponds to the Shannon
entropy of the eigenvalue spectrum of ρ. This entropy has been
generalized to the case of multilayer systems86, composite
networks where units exhibit different types of relationships that
are generally modeled as different layers (see ref. 17,18,87 for a
thorough review).
It has been recently shown that the von Neumann entropy
calculated from the rescaled Laplacian does not satisfy the sub-
additivity property in some circumstances32,41. This undesirable
feature can be addressed by means of a more grounded deﬁnition32,
whose rationale is to measure the entropy of a network by
exploiting how information diffuses through its topology. Informa-
tion diffusion in this context is governed by the equation
_ψiðtÞ ¼ 
X
N
j¼1
LjiψjðtÞ;
ð13Þ
with ψi(t) the amount of information in node i at time t. The
solution of this diffusion equation is given, in vector notation, by
ψ(t) = exp(−Lt)ψ(0), whose normalized propagator is used to
deﬁne the density matrix as
ρ ¼
eτL
TrðeτLÞ ;
ð14Þ
where time plays the role of a resolution parameter allowing one
to probe entropy at different scales32. A similar approach,
involving a modiﬁed Laplacian matrix, has been recently used for
revealing
the
mesoscale
structure
of
complex
directed
networks88,89.
This quantum-inspired framework provides a powerful basis to
develop an information theory of complex networks, with direct
applications
in
classical
network
science,
such
as
system
comparison.
Comparing classical networks. A known problem in network
science is to compare two networks, without relying on a speciﬁc
subset of indicators. Network information entropy allows one to
introduce relative entropies such as the Kullback–Leibler diver-
gence, to compare two networks with density matrices ρ and σ
respectively:

ð15Þ
By
exploiting
the
well-known
classical
result
that
the
minimization of Kullback–Leibler divergence between a reference
distribution and its parametric model corresponds to the
maximization of the likelihood, it has been shown that in a
network context this allows one to deﬁne the network log-
likelihood by

The introduction of network likelihood opens the door to a
variety of applications in statistical inference and model selection,
based on concepts such as the Fisher information matrix, Akaike

This new framework has been used to compare networks for
several purposes. For instance, in the case of pairs of networks,
the graphs are ﬁrst merged by connecting each node from one
network to any other node in the other network. Successively,
continuous-time
quantum
walks
are
used
to
explore
the
composite system and the quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence
between the evolution of two walks is calculated. This divergence,
that is a measure of (dis)similarity, is shown to be maximum
when the two original networks are isomorphic60.
The square root of quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence has
the nice property of deﬁning a metric, allowing one to deﬁne a
distance between networks. If ρ and σ are two density matrices
corresponding
to
two
networks
with
N
nodes,
their
Jensen–Shannon divergence is deﬁned by
DJSðρjjσÞ ¼ 1
2 DKLðρjjμÞ þ 1
2 DKLðσjjμÞ
ð17Þ
¼ SðμÞ  1
2 ½SðρÞ þ SðσÞ;
ð18Þ
that is the difference between the entropy of the mixture μ ¼
1
2 ðρ þ σÞ and the semi-sum of the entropies of the original
systems. In the context of multilayer systems, this measure has
been used to quantify the distance between layers of a multiplex
network, cluster, and aggregate them appropriately in order to
reduce its structural complexity41.
These ideas have quickly found direct applications in biology.
In genetic molecular systems, such as the ones described by
gene–protein interactions, layers might encode different relation-
ships among molecules—functional, e.g., additive, suppressive
and other types of association, or physical, e.g., colocalization or
direct
interaction.
The
information-theoretic
framework
described here allowed to show that such systems exhibit a
certain level of redundancy, larger than the one observed in man-
made systems41, suggesting the existence of biological mechan-
isms devoted to maximize diversity of interactions.
In computational neuroscience studies, the connectome of the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans—one of the most studied in the
ﬁeld because of its small size, with ~300 neuronal cells—has been
mapped to a multiplex network where layers encode synaptic, gap
junction, and neuromodulator interactions. Here, the analysis of
reducibility revealed that the monoamine networks have a unique
structure, with information complementary to that provided by
neuropeptide networks90. The same analysis, applied to a
multilayer functional representation of the human brain revealed,
quantitatively, the importance of not disregarding or aggregating
connectivity information for clinical classiﬁcation of healthy and
schizophrenic subjects91.
In another application the Jensen–Shannon distance between
layers
of
a
multiplex
system
has
been
used
to
identify
community-based associations in the human microbiome32,
where the microbial network corresponding to each body site is
represented by a layer in a multiplex network, in perfect
agreement with biological expectation92.
The (dis)similarity between networks has also been quantiﬁed
by using a combination of the classical Jensen–Shannon distance
and the concept of network node dispersion, measuring the
heterogeneity of a graph in terms of connectivity distance among
its nodes42.
Degree distribution of quantum networks. Nodes in a complex
network have different roles and their inﬂuence on system
dynamics can vary widely depending on their topological char-
acteristics. One of the simpler (and widely applied) characteristics
is the degree centrality, deﬁned as the number of edges incident
on that node. Many real world networks have been found to
follow a widely heterogeneous distribution of degree values93.
Several models, based on mechanisms like preferential attach-
ment15, ﬁtness94, or constrained random wiring54, to mention
some of them, were developed to reproduce degree distributions
commonly observed in empirical systems. Despite the complexity
of the linking pattern, the degree distribution of a network affects
in a simple way the ongoing dynamics. In fact, it can be shown
that the probability of ﬁnding a memoryless random walker at a
given node of a symmetric network at the stationary state, is just
proportional to the degree of such node68.
In ref. 7, theauthors consider the relationship between the
stochastic and the quantum version of such processes, with the
ultimate goal of shedding light on the meaning of degree
centrality in the case of quantum networks. They consider a
stochastic
evolution
governed
by
the
Laplacian
matrix
LS ¼ LD1, the stochastic generator that characterizes classical
random walk dynamics and leads to an occupation probability
proportional to node degree. In the quantum version, an
hermitian generator is required and the authors proposed the
symmetric Laplacian matrix LQ ¼ D1
2LD1
2, generating a valid
quantum walk that, however, does not lead to a stationary state,
making difﬁcult a direct comparison between classical and
quantum versions of the dynamics. A common and useful
workaround to this issue is to average the occupation probability
over time, as in Eq. (4).
The generators of the two dynamics are spectrally similar (see
Fig. 2) and share the same eigenvalues, whereas the eigenvectors
are related by the transformation ϕC
i ¼ D1
2ϕQ
i . As a consequence,
if the system is in the ground state the average probability to ﬁnd
the walker on a node will be the same as in the classic case, which

Mesoscale organization of quantum systems. Community
detection, and in general mesoscopic structure detection, has been
widely studied in the literature of classical complex networks95,96.
Although the deﬁnition of community “a subset of nodes tightly
connected compared to what is expected” is in general ill deﬁned
and part of an ongoing debate, the number of proposed algo-
rithms is incredibly high and still growing.
The cross-pollination of community detection with quantum
mechanics is in two levels. On the one hand, chronologically, the
ﬁrst attempt was to borrow tools from quantum mechanics for
applications to classical systems88,97–100. On the other hand, an
algorithm to ﬁnd communities in complex quantum systems was
proposed in ref. 13.
In ref. 97,98, the authors propose a method for data clustering
similar to kernel density estimators, in a quantum framework.
The given data points are mapped to a Gaussian wave function
and, supposing that the latter is an eigenstate for some
time-independent Schrödingher equation:
Hψ ¼ ½T þ VðxÞψ ¼ E0ψ;
the minimization of the potential V(x) leads to the desired
clustering. An extension to dynamical quantum systems has been
introduced in ref. 99. In this case the expectation values of the
position operator evolves in time toward the closer minimum of
the potential. This formulation can leverage the acceleration of
graphics hardware.
A method based on continuous-time quantum walks was
proposed in ref. 100. Here, a node-afﬁnity measure based on the
response of node population density to link failure was given. If the
population on two nodes changes in a similar manner after link
removal, they are more likely to belong to the same community.
A magnetic Laplacian, where a magnetic ﬁeld is expected to
traverse all cycles in the network, was used in ref. 88. With an
approach similar to chiral walks, previously described, the
symmetric Laplacian is amended with the original link direction-
ality by a phase term e±iθ, with θ being a parameter for the
method, and used for community detection in directed networks,
a longstanding problem in network science.
In the case of quantum systems, partitioning in modular units
has been often carried out on the basis of ad hoc considerations.
In an effort to extend community detection to the quantum
mechanics realm, Faccin et al.13 introduced several closeness
matrices inspired by different quantum quantities. Given the
Hamiltonian H ¼ P
ij Hij ij i jh j of the quantum system of interest,
the authors consider a continuous-time random walk on the
system topology. The ﬁrst quantity is energy transport, porting to
the quantum realm the concept applied in several classical
algorithms where communities are interpreted as traps for the
dynamical process. In this framework, two nodes are considered
to be close if, on average, their in-between transport is high. If this
average is computed over a short time period (compared with
evolution time scales), then the closeness values are proportional
to the Hamiltonian terms |Hij|, providing a classical approach to
community detection (see Fig. 3). A second quantity, also
proposed as a closeness measure, is related to the average ﬁdelity
of the evolving process compared with the initial state. In this
case,
the
localization
of
eigenstates
is

current ad hoc approaches to partitioning nodes in quantum

Outlook in quantum network science
Generalization of complex network methods to the quantum
setting represents a foundational advancement required to
understand complexity in physical systems. These methods
represent a change of paradigm, which bring several road blocks
that must be faced. Centrally, the application domain of complex
network methods to quantum physics must be expanded,
whereas studies in the other direction, i.e., where methods
from the quantum domain have now been ported to network
science.
From a foundational perspective, as networks necessarily
represent physical systems, such systems are inherently governed
by the laws of information physics. In fact, a research line is
emerging now that seeks to quantify, in terms of implicit infor-
mation processing capacity, networked systems, with several
applications
to
social,
technological,
and
biological
systems32,41,42,90,91. Although this interesting direction seems
promising, yet it is comparably in its infancy, whereas it is still
not known how to generalize classical concepts of complexity
science to the quantum domain. Another relevant research
direction, crucial for applications in classical network science,
concerns the interplay between structure and dynamics, which is
almost entirely unclear in the case of quantum networks.
Although scale-free networks have been considered in the
quantum setting33, the result is an—albeit interesting—toy model
with
theoretical
predictions
to
be
veriﬁed
experimentally.
Therefore, further advancement along this track is of central
interest, because it might play a fundamental role in quantum-
enhanced technology and could lead to experiments devoted to
test cross-disciplinary ideas in quantum and complexity science34.
The quest for a theoretical foundation for quantum complex
networks might have a deep impact in information and com-
munication technology. Although information processing in
classical systems is well controlled, it is also rather limited and
quantum computing might overcome such limitations101,102.
However, given that such systems are more sensitive to interac-
tions with the environment, they are also more exposed to errors
than their classical counterparts. Quantum error-correcting codes
allow us to store and manipulate quantum information in the
presence of certain types of noise that, in this context, might
perturb the quantum system causing effects similar to random
failures in classical complex networks. The development of
quantum error correction techniques that make quantum com-
puting and quantum communication possible cannot prescind
from the study of “system resilience”, a topic that found
uncountable
applications
in
classical
network
science26,28,31,103,104. Other types of perturbations that are nat-
ural for classical systems, such as targeted attacks of network
hubs26 or cascade-based attacks105, still have no clear quantum
counterpart and their study, from both theoretical and experi-
mental perspectives, will play a key role in the development of a
quantum Internet5. In fact, it is tantalizing to think about how
quantum hubs should be protected by the quantum counterpart
of typical denial of service attacks.
Continued advances in the theory of complexity in networked
quantum systems will help address the challenges faced as
quantum technologies scale up to commercially feasible products.
Work toward a quantum theory of complex networked systems is
already opening up novel avenues when facing contemporary
complexity challenges.
