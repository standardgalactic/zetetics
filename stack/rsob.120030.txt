1. Summary
The generation of an embryonic body plan is the outcome of inductive inter-
actions between the progenitor tissues that underpin their specification,
regionalization and morphogenesis. The intercellular signalling activity driving
these processes is deployed in a time- and site-specific manner, and the signal
strength must be precisely controlled. Receptor and ligand functions are modu-
lated by secreted antagonists to impose a dynamic pattern of globally controlled
and locally graded signals onto the tissues of early post-implantation mouse
embryo. In response to the WNT, Nodal and Bone Morphogenetic Protein
(BMP) signalling cascades, the embryo acquires its body plan, which manifests
as differences in the developmental fate of cells located at different positions in
the anterior–posterior body axis. The initial formation of the anterior (head)
structures in the mouse embryo is critically dependent on the morphogenetic
activity emanating from two signalling centres that are juxtaposed with the
progenitor tissues of the head. A common property of these centres is that
they are the source of antagonistic factors and the hub of transcriptional activi-
ties that negatively modulate the function of WNT, Nodal and BMP signalling
cascades. These events generate the scaffold of the embryonic head by the
early-somite stage of development. Beyond this, additional tissue interactions
continue to support the growth, regionalization, differentiation and morpho-
genesis required for the elaboration of the structure recognizable as the
embryonic head.
2. Establishing the blueprint of the embryonic head
2.1. Prelude to germ layer formation
During the initial phase of mouse development, the zygote (fertilized egg)
undertakes multiple rounds of cleavage divisions and concurrently allocates
cellular progeny to three tissue lineages (trophectoderm, epiblast and primitive
endoderm) of the resultant embryo, known as the blastocyst. The blastocyst is
built as a vesicular structure (figure 1a) with an epithelial layer (the trophecto-
derm) enclosing a cavity (the blastocoel) and, attached to the wall on one side of
the blastocoel, a cluster of cells that constitutes the inner cell mass (ICM). The
ICM is further segregated into the epiblast, which gives rise to the entire

embryo and some components of the foetal extraembryonic
membranes, and the primitive endoderm that lines the lumi-
nal surface of the cluster of epiblast cells [1].
Following the implantation of the blastocyst, the epiblast
and primitive endoderm grow into the blastocoel to form a
cylindrical
embryo—the
egg
cylinder
(figure
1b).
The
embryo is composed of a column of three tissues: proximally
the extraembryonic ectoderm (derived from the trophecto-
derm),
distally
the
epiblast
(a
cup-shaped
epithelium
derived from the ICM) and, enveloping these two tissues, a
thin layer of visceral endoderm (descended from the primi-
tive
endoderm).
The
embryo,
while
maintaining
the
cylindrical architecture, continues to grow by cell division,
and cells move around in the visceral endoderm and the epi-
blast (figure 1c). Through the process of gastrulation, cells
from the epiblast are allocated to three definitive germ
layers: the ectoderm, the mesoderm and the endoderm
(figure 1d). The formation of latter two layers is accom-
plished by morphogenetic cell movement: ingression of
epiblast cells at the site of epithelial–mesenchyme transition
(the primitive streak), the organization of the ingressed
mesoderm progenitors into a mesenchymal layer and the
incorporation of the endoderm progenitors into the pre-existing
layer of visceral endoderm [2,3].
2.2. The building blocks
The emergence and the developmental trajectory of germ
layer derivatives have been examined in the mouse embryo
extensively
by
fate-mapping
analysis
at
developmental
stages from immediately before the onset of gastrulation to
the formative stage of head morphogenesis (figure 2). These
studies have identified the location of progenitor cells and
their descendants that contribute the tissues that make up
the embryonic head. Derivatives of the three germ layers con-
tribute to different parts of the brain, the facial primordia and
the upper digestive tract.
2.2.1. Ectoderm
At the pre-gastrulation stage, germ layer progenitors are
broadly regionalized in the epiblast: ectoderm in the prospec-
tive
anterior and
distal
domains,
and
endoderm
and
mesoderm in the prospective posterior domain, with a predo-
minantly mesoderm domain intercalated between these two
regions (figure 2a). After gastrulation is initiated, the ecto-
derm progenitors can be resolved into those destined for
surface
ectoderm
(body
covering)
and
neuroectoderm,
respectively. Within the neuroectoderm domain, cells that
contribute to the brain are localized more anteriorly than
those of the spinal cord (figure 2b). During gastrulation,
this neuroectoderm population expands anteriorly and proxi-
mally, and eventually occupies over two-thirds of the area of
the ectoderm layer by the time the embryo has formed a com-
plete layer of mesoderm. This is accompanied by an emerging
pattern of regionalization of the progenitors for ectoderm tis-
sues
of
the
head.
Progenitor
cells
of
the
non-neural
derivatives (e.g. surface ectoderm and buccal lining) and
neural tissues of forebrain, the midbrain and the hindbrain
are localized, in the respective anterior–posterior order, to
domains
that
are
increasingly
farther
away
from
the
rostral-most border of the ectoderm (figure 2b). In addition,
the progenitors of another non-neural ectoderm derivative,
the neural crest cells that give rise to the ecto-mesenchyme
and cranial ganglia in the head, are mapped to the border
region of neural and surface ectoderm domain [4].

cells in the presumptive forebrain domain, it was noted that

while there is a preference of these cells to colonize the fore-
brain, some descendants are also found in the more posterior
brain parts [5]. This tendency of clones expanding to neigh-
bouring brain parts diminishes for neuroectoderm cells of
more advanced embryos, suggesting that the neural progeni-
tor cells are either becoming more restricted in their fate or
progressively confined to a spatially defined domain during
development [6]. The relative size of the domain of progeni-
tors does not correlate with the final size of the brain part.
Specifically, the forebrain has undergone a disproportionate
expansion during neurulation, which is underscored by the
wide area covered by the clones of forebrain neuroectoderm
cells. This requirement of tissue growth for morphogenesis
underpins the vulnerability of the forebrain in developmental
errors that lead to head truncation.
2.2.2. Mesoderm
Cells in the mesoderm domain of the epiblast of embryos at
the onset of gastrulation have been shown to contribute to
head (cranial) mesoderm and other somatic mesoderm.
During germ layer formation, epiblast cells are allocated
sequentially to mesoderm of the heart, head and the trunk
along the anterior–posterior body axis [7]. After ingression
through the primitive streak, the heart and cranial mesoderm
progenitors are displaced as a tissue sheet to the anterior
region of the embryo and ultimately underlie the prospective
brain domains within the ectoderm (figure 2c). The cranial
mesoderm together with the ectomesenchyme derived from
the neural crest cells give rise to the skeleton, muscles, vascular
and connective tissue of the head and face [8,9].

The progenitors of another mesoderm population (the axial
mesoderm) are co-localized with those of the endoderm. The
cells of the axial mesoderm ingress through the anterior seg-
ment of the primitive streak and extend along the embryonic
midline by convergent extension to reach the entire length of
the body axis. The resulting midline structure underlies the
brain and spinal cord, and is given different names according
to its position in the anterior–posterior axis: the axial meso-
derm that underlies the forebrain is the prechordal plate and
that which associates with the rest of the brain is the anterior
notochord, whereas the segment underneath the spinal cord
is the notochord [10]. During its ontogeny, cells of the axial
mesoderm are transiently part of the endoderm layer but
later separate from it to take up a position among the meso-
derm tissues. To distinguish these phases of development, for
the period in which the axial mesoderm is contiguous with
the flanking endoderm, it is referred to as axial mesendoderm.
2.2.3. Endoderm
In the pre-gastrulation embryo, a layer of endoderm cells (the
visceral endoderm) is already present. Contrary to the con-
ventional concept that the visceral endoderm gives rise only
to the non-embryonic tissue that lines the extraembryonic
yolk sac, its descendants can contribute to the anterior and
posterior segments of the embryonic gut [11]. The ultimate
fate of these cells in the digestive tract is not known. The
bulk of gut (definitive) endoderm cells is recruited from
their progenitors in the epiblast (figure 2a). Definitive endo-
derm ingressed at the anterior segment of the primitive
streak is incorporated into the pre-existing visceral endoderm
by intercalation over a wide area and not restricted to the
sites in the immediate vicinity of the primitive streak.
Through a concerted movement, cells destined for the
upper digestive tract (the foregut) congregate to the anterior
region of the endoderm layer (the anterior definitive endo-
derm, figure 2d) underlying the cranial and heart mesoderm
and the prospective brain domains in the ectoderm [12].
During head morphogenesis, the endoderm forms the lining
of the embryonic foregut and the associated organs [13–15].
The formation of the three germ layer derivatives hence-
forth completes the building blocks of the head. The
ensuing morphogenetic movement that brings these tissue
components to their proper place in the body plan establishes
the blueprint of the embryonic head by the early-somite stage
of development. Later events will continue to build upon this
scaffold until the fully differentiated head structures emerge.
3. Anterior–posterior polarity and
signalling centre in the anterior visceral
endoderm
3.1. Proximal–distal regionalization of gene activity in
the egg cylinder
Analysis of gene expression in the egg cylinder embryo has
revealed that the transcripts encoding components of signal-
ling pathways such as that of Nodal, BMP and WNT are
localized to specific tissue compartments [3,16–19]. For
example, signalling ligand genes such as Bmp2, Bmp8b,
Bmp4, Wnt2b, Wnt3, and activating convertase enzymes for
Nodal such as Furin and Pcsk6 are expressed in the extraem-
bryonic ectoderm or the proximal population of visceral
endoderm. In contrast, factors that antagonize the TGF-beta
and WNT signalling activity, such as Cerl, Lefty1 and Dkk1,
are expressed in the distal population of the visceral endoderm
(the distal visceral endoderm, DVE). In the epiblast, Nodal is
expressed in the proximal domain whereas the Cripto receptor
is uniformly expressed. Notwithstanding the caveat that gene
expression domains may not reflect the range of action of
the signalling factors, the regionalization of transcripts points
to a graded pattern of high to low signalling activity in the
proximal–distal dimension of the egg cylinder.
3.2. Ontogeny of distal visceral endoderm and anterior
visceral endoderm
By tracing the trajectory of Lefty1-expressing cells that first
emerge in the blastocyst, the DVE cells are found to descend
from a subset of primitive endoderm cells [20,21]. It remains
unclear how these progenitors and their progeny are translo-
cated en masse from a lopsided position in the primitive
endoderm to the distal site in the visceral endoderm over a
2-day period of development. A possible mechanism is that
the displacement of these Lefty1-active cells is driven by
their response to Nodal and WNT signals such that they
are compelled to move away from regions of high signal
activity and congregate to the distal part of the visceral
endoderm. Subsequently, the population of Lefty1- and
Cer1-positive cells expands, and later these cells are relocated
to anterior region of the visceral endoderm (and become
known as the anterior visceral endoderm, AVE) [22]. Con-
trary to the notion that these AVE cells are descendants of
the DVE cells, recent lineage analysis reveals that they are
of separate lineages. The DVE cells do not give rise to AVE
cells, although they share similar molecular properties, inter-
mingle with the AVE cells and participate in similar act of cell
movement to the anterior side of the embryo [20]. The pro-
genitors of the AVE are generated de novo from other
visceral endoderm. This is likely to be accomplished via the
modulation of BMP inductive activity [23–25], but does not
require the presence of DVE cells [20].
3.3. Acquisition of anterior–posterior body axis polarity
Both the DVE cells and AVE progenitors are localized initially
to the distal sites of the egg cylinder. In this position,
the antagonistic activity emanated from these cells may
contribute to the alignment of a signalling axis in the proxi-
mal–distal plane of the embryo. By transforming the cup-
shaped epiblast and the associated visceral endoderm to a
flat disc-like configuration, it can be visualized that the
signal activity may lead to a radially symmetrical body
plan [26]. The breaking of this radial symmetry may be
achieved by localizing the source of signals or that of the
antagonists to one side of the embryo and thereby creating
an asymmetry of the body plan. The movement of the
mixed populations of Lefty1 and Cer1-expressing DVE and
AVE cells to the prospective anterior pole of the embryo is
therefore key to the acquisition of the anterior–posterior
polarity by the embryo.
While the presence of the DVE is not a prerequisite for the
de novo formation of AVE cells, DVE cells are required for the

anterior displacement of the AVE cells [20]. Visceral endo-
derm cells that are recruited to the AVE and begin to
express Lefty1 join the anterior stream of cells. Whether the
DVE cells act to initiate as well as to guide the movement
of the AVE cells and the mechanistic basis for such naviga-
tional activity are not known. Likewise, the morphogenetic
forces that drive the directional movement of the visceral
endoderm cells are not fully known. Experimental manipula-
tions of Nodal/Lefty1 and WNT/Dkk1 signalling activity
reveal that the visceral endoderm cells respond to differences
in signal intensity (by travelling towards regions of low signal
activity) [27,28], and to the differential proliferative activity
of the epiblast
[29]. Loss of Otx2 function, which is
accompanied by the loss of Dkk1 activity, impairs the anterior
movement of the visceral endoderm [30]. Enforced expression
of Dkk1 under the control of Otx2 can restore the migratory
activity of the Otx2-deficient cells [27]. These experiments
provide circumstantial evidence that expression of Nodal
and WNT antagonists by the AVE cells influences their
migratory behaviour. Lefty1-positive AVE cells remain in
the anterior domain of the endoderm, whereas DVE cells
that lose Lefty1 activity after they reach the anterior site con-
tinue to migrate but follow a different path to the lateral
region of the embryo.
3.4. Regionalization of signalling activity and impact on
epiblast patterning
The displacement and expansion of the DVE and AVE cells to
the anterior side of the embryo establish an anterior source of
antagonistic activity against Nodal and WNT signals. Con-
currently, the expression domain of Nodal and Wnt3 retreats
to the posterior side of the embryo. The proximal–distal sig-
nalling axis is consequently realigned to the prospective
anterior–posterior body axis of the embryo. Specifically for
the WNT signalling pathway, other antagonists in addition
to Dkk1 (e.g. Sfrp1, Sfrp5, Cer1) are expressed in the anterior
part of the embryo, whereas WNT ligands (such as Wnt3,
Wnt2b and Wnt8a) are expressed in the posterior part of the
embryo [16,31]. These opposing domains of antagonists and
ligands presumably establish a low to high gradient of
WNT signalling activity across the anterior–posterior plane
of the embryo. Similarly, a Lefty1–Nodal and Cer1–BMP sig-
nalling gradient may also be established. The provision by
the AVE of secreted inhibitors such as Dkk1, Cer1 and
Lefty1 to modulate WNT, BMP and Nodal factors is critical
for the differentiation of the epiblast. The combined loss of
function of Cer1 and Lefty1 leads to the formation of an
enlarged primitive streak (i.e. enhanced specification of
mesoderm and endoderm lineages). This phenotype is
partly suppressed when Nodal signalling is decreased, indi-
cating that these molecules normally constrain the level of
Nodal signal within the epiblast [32]. Likewise, an inability
to establish the AVE (for example, in Otx2 mutants) results
in ectopic expression of mesoderm markers in the epiblast,
a manifestation of the posteriorization of the epiblast [27].
It may be noted that the area traversed by the migrating
AVE and final residence of the AVE match the domain of
the ectoderm progenitors (amniotic, surface and neural ecto-
derm) in the epiblast. In contrast, the epiblast in the domain
of high WNT and Nodal activity is destined for the formation
of the mesoderm and endoderm (figure 2). A crucial role of
the AVE is therefore to maintain the naive characteristics of
the anterior epiblast and to prevent inappropriate differen-
tiation to non-ectodermal cells. Recently, evidence has
emerged that the AVE is also a source of instructive signals.
Bmp2 is expressed in the AVE of the early gastrula, and
then in the node, anterior definitive endoderm and pre-
chordal plate of the late gastrula. Conditional ablation of
visceral-endoderm-derived Bmp2 rescues some, but not all,
of the Bmp2-null phenotypes: anterior definitive endoderm
and prechordal plate are specified, but the development of
head and foregut is perturbed [33]. Apparently, the signalling
activity of the AVE has a lasting impact on the differentiation
and morphogenesis of epiblast-derived tissues into head
structures.
However,
tissue
transplantation
experiments
have revealed that AVE itself is not sufficient for inducing
or maintaining the differentiation of the epiblast into anterior
neural tissues [34], suggesting that the AVE may act primarily
as a source of permissive signals for the development of
anterior structures.
4. Gastrulation and anterior midline
signalling
4.1. Sources of morphogenetic activity
Lineage-tracing studies have revealed that during gastrula-
tion, descendants of the visceral endoderm remain among
the anterior definitive endoderm, the gastrula organizer
(node) and the anterior mesendoderm [11]. This raises the
possibility that some AVE descendants may persist through-
out gastrulation and continue to perform the AVE-related
morphogenetic function. However, the domain previously
occupied by the AVE is mostly populated by the incoming
anterior definitive endoderm (ADE) and the axial mesendo-
derm (AME). Both tissues are recruited from cells that
ingress through the anterior segment of the primitive streak
that encompasses the gastrula organizer. These tissues
reach the anterior region of the embryo by separate morpho-
genetic tissue movement along the midline and the lateral
regions underneath the cephalic neural primordial [10]. Simi-
lar to the AVE, the ADE and the AME are the source of
antagonistic activity to WNT and BMP signalling, and they
express Dkk1, Chrd and Noggin.
The critical role of ADE and AME in promoting anterior
patterning is revealed by the truncation and malformation
of head structures when ADE and/or AME development or
function is perturbed. A failure of differentiation or disrup-
tion of tissue movement (e.g. in Mixl1, Lhx1, Foxa2 and Zic2
mutants), or the loss of morphogenetic signalling activity
(e.g. Shh, Dkk1, Chrd and Nog), impairs early stages of head
formation [35–41]. The AME is composed of the prechordal
plate and the anterior notochord, which functionally interact
with each other via planar signals. For example, the prechor-
dal plate is not maintained in the absence of the anterior
notochord [41,42], and the prechordal plate is required to
suppress the ectopic activation of Gsc in the anterior noto-
chord [42]. Furthermore, the prechordal plate provides
inductive activity for sustaining the differentiation of the
ADE [37]. The identity of the molecules that direct the pro-
gressive differentiation of the AME and ADE is not known,
but the intricate network of cross-talk among these three epi-
blast-derived tissues is central to the maintenance of the

anterior neural characteristics of the neuroectoderm and the
formation of the head structures (figure 3).
4.2. Balancing the signalling activity
Morphogenetic signals must be delivered at the right time,
place and strength to elicit proper lineage differentiation
and morphogenesis of the head progenitor tissues. The com-
plex mechanisms that localize, constrain and refine Nodal
signals at the onset of gastrulation have been reviewed else-
where [17]. Similarly, complex mechanisms are employed to
balance the WNT signals that permit the early events of
head formation [43]. In the embryo at gastrulation, the
expression domain of Wnt3 in the posterior region juxtaposes
that of Dkk1, which separates the Wnt3 domain from the Fzd8
receptor domain in the anterior region. The Dkk1 and Fzd8
domains together shadow the domain of brain and cranial
mesoderm progenitors in the ectoderm and mesoderm,
respectively (figure 4). These molecular annotations of the
fate map point to a plausible scenario in which Wnt3 signal
emanating from the posterior epiblast and the primitive
streak is dampened by the Dkk1 antagonist such that a
reduced level of signalling activity is perceived by the recep-
tive head progenitor tissues. While other WNT antagonists
are expressed at this stage of embryonic development, the
loss of Dkk1 alone can cause a major disruption of head
development. This finding suggests that the function of
Dkk1 cannot be replaced by other antagonists, which display
no changes in their expression in the Dkk1-null mutant
embryo. When Wnt3 activity is reduced (by genetically silen-
cing one Wnt3 allele) on the Dkk1-null background, head
development is partially restored. This indicates that the pri-
mary target of Dkk1 is the Wnt3-mediated signalling cascade
and that other WNT factors (which do not change their
expression significantly in the Wnt3 and Dkk1 mutants)
might play a lesser role in head development [43].
Wnt3 is a canonical WNT signalling molecule and these
experiments therefore also imply that Dkk1 exerts its influ-
ence by modulation of canonical WNT signalling [44]. This
has been confirmed by the demonstration that different
permutations of mutations of the antagonist (Dkk1), the
co-receptor (Lrp6) and transcription co-activator (b-catenin)
produce phenocopies of the head defects associated with
excessive canonical signalling activity. Furthermore, the
different degrees of elevation of WNT signalling activity
caused by the three mutated genes correlate with the severity
of the head defects, with the tissues of the anterior brain
region being more sensitive to changes in the signalling
activity than those of the posterior regions. Therefore, Dkk1
acts by controlling the level of canonical signalling activity
perceived by the target tissue, and a stringent control of the
signal strength at different locations in the anterior–posterior
plane is critical for the development of specific brain parts.

endoderm, and activated in the posterior epiblast and the
early primitive streak. The requirement for Dkk1 modulation
of Wnt3 signals is therefore confined mainly to pre- and early
gastrulation.
4.3. Intersection with transcriptional activity
The WNT antagonist Dkk1 has been shown to be a direct
transcriptional
target
of
the
WNT/b-catenin-dependent
activity [45,46]. The downstream activation of an antagonist
thereby provides a negative feedback mechanism for the
modulation, rather than wholesale inhibition, of the canonical
signalling activity. This feedback mechanism is disrupted
when one allele of both Dkk1 and Wnt3 is ablated. The
reduced WNT signal acting on only one functional Dkk1
allele leads to a decreased amount of antagonist that is
inadequate to modulate the Wnt3 activity [43]. Negative
modulation of signalling activity is also achieved at the
level of transcription of Wnt pathway components. For
example, Gsc activity in the prechordal plate, which nega-
tively regulates itself, represses the transcription of WNT
ligands (such as Wnt8 [47]), and Sox17 in the ADE may
downregulate the expression of b-catenin target
genes
through
the
physical
interaction
and
redeployment
of
b-catenin for other non-signalling cellular functions [48,49].
Similar to the phenotypic effect of loss of Dkk1 function,
mutations of two transcription factor genes, Lhx1 and Otx2,
produce head truncation defects [50,51]. Loss of Lhx1 is
accompanied by the failure to form the AME, through its
downstream effect on the expression of non-canonical WNT
signalling factors that influence morphogenetic cell move-
ment in the mesoderm and the AME [39]. Loss of Lhx1
function also elicits a more global response of the upregula-
tion
of
WNT
response
genes
and,
concurrently,
the
downregulation of WNT antagonists and also the Otx2
transcription factor gene (N. Fossat & P. P. L. Tam 2012,
unpublished data). Combinations of mutations of Dkk1,
Lhx1 and Otx2 are associated with the manifestation of
head truncation phenotype, albeit in varying degrees with
different permutations. While these findings indicate a poten-
tial
intersection
of
WNT
signalling
activity
with
the
transcription of head-forming genes, the underpinning mol-
ecular mechanism is not fully known. However, Lhx1 factor
is a component of the transcription complex containing
Ssdp1 and Ldb1. This complex may be targeted to or
cooperating with the Otx2 gene, which in turn regulates the
expression of several WNT antagonists. Loss of Ssdp1 and
Ldb1 function individually has been shown to cause head
defects and reduced expression of antagonists including
Dkk1 in the prechordal plate and Sfrps in the ADE, and com-
binations of Ssdp1 and Lhx1 or Ldb1 mutant alleles produce
phenocopies of head defects [52,53]. These data provide com-
pelling evidence of a functional intersection of transcription
activity with the molecular cascade of WNT signalling that
promotes head morphogenesis (figure 5). It appears that a
complex network of secreted antagonists, co-receptors and
transcriptional
feedback
mechanisms regulate
the
time,
space and strength of the WNT signals that drive the initial
differentiation and morphogenesis of the progenitor tissues
of the murine embryonic head. A landscape of graded
WNT signalling activity along the anterior–posterior axis of
early embryos is found in a multitude of vertebrate and
invertebrate species [54,55]. Similarly, modulating BMP
signalling by the antagonist (e.g. Cerberus) emanating from
the endoderm is required for anterior patterning of Xenopus
embryo [55,56]. The stringent regulation and regionalization
of signalling activity may therefore be a highly conserved
molecular mechanism of embryonic patterning.
5. Conclusion
Our current understanding indicates that the initial events in
formation of the murine head rely on graded signalling
activity of the WNT, Nodal and BMP pathways. Prior to gas-
trulation, these signalling cascades together elicit the first overt
sign of anterior–posterior polarity when a mixed population
of DVE and AVE cells move to the prospective anterior pole
of the embryo and form the AVE signalling centre. This
centre secretes WNT, Nodal and BMP antagonists, and deli-
mits a region of embryo in which the future neuroectoderm
can escape the signals that drive epiblast ingression and differ-
entiation into the definitive endoderm and mesoderm at the
primitive streak. The mesoderm and endoderm derivatives
(ADE and AME) of the anterior primitive streak replace
much of the pre-gastrula visceral endoderm and, like the
AVE, they also supply WNT, Nodal and BMP antagonists.
Interactions
between
these
definitive
tissues
generate
anterior–posterior differences within the ADE and AME,
which maintain the neural character of (and perhaps begin
to regionalize) the overlying neuroectoderm. The WNT,
Nodal and BMP antagonism provided by these signalling
centres is essential for the anterior patterning of the germ
layer derivatives and thereby establishing a blueprint of the
embryonic head. It stands to reason that, as well as controlling

Sources of signals in the gastrulation stage embryo: Bone Morphogenetic
Protein (BMP) from the extraembryonic ectoderm and the posterior epiblast,
and WNT (Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt3a and Wnt8a) and Nodal from the posterior
epiblast and primitive streak. BMP antagonists Noggin (Nog) and Chordin
(Chrd); Nodal antagonist Lefty1; WNT antagonists Dickkorf-1 (Dkk1) and
Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps). Transcription factors: Goosecoid
(Gsc), LIM homeobox protein 1 (Lhx1), LIM domain binding 1 (Ldb1), Single-
stranded DNA binding protein 1 (Ssdp1); Orthodenticle homologue 2 (Otx2),
SRY-box containing gene 17 (Sox17).

the expression of secreted antagonists, transcription factors
expressed at the signalling centres also repress the expression
of ligands and the downstream effectors of WNT, Nodal and
BMP signalling. The integration of signalling and transcrip-
tional activity in the signalling centres and the progenitor
tissues is therefore instrumental for initiating and orchestrating
the development of the embryonic head.

Patrick’s research focuses on the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of body
patterning during embryonic development. Major effort is aimed at the understanding of the inte-
gration of the molecular control of gene activity and the signalling activity that mediates cell–cell
communication and the coordination of cell differentiation in the formation of organs and major
body parts.

Ruth Arkell currently heads the Early Mammalian Development Laboratory. She completed her
undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney (BSc Hons) and commenced doctoral studies in
Mouse Molecular Embryology in 1992 at Edinburgh University. These studies were completed at
the National Institute for Medical Research in London in 1996. In order to capitalize on the new
opportunities which would arise once the mouse genome sequence was available, she pursued
post-doctoral research training (in London and Oxfordshire) in mouse functional genetics. In 2000,
she was awarded a UK MRC Career Development Award and established a research group in
Oxfordshire to study gene function during mouse gastrulation. In 2006, she was a Sylvia and Charles
Viertel Senior Medical Fellowship recipient and moved her research to The Australian National Uni-
versity. In 2009, she was the recipient of the ANZSCDB Young Investigator Award. She continues to
use embryology and functional genetics to study the molecular and embryological basis of congenital
defects that have their aetiology in gastrulation.
