14 Transparent Experience and the Availability of Qualia 
Brian Loar
In this chapter, Loar attempts to combine the representationist insight of Harman, Dretske, and others
about the transparency of normal visual experience with the qualiphile commitment to introspectible
intrinsic qualia. He rejects both the standard view of raw qualia according to which qualia are not
essentially representational, but rather, like paint on canvas, are individuated independently of their
representational properties, and what he calls the standard representationist attack on qualia,
according to which no matter how well you try to introspect your normal visual experience, all you will
notice is the apparent objects and properties that your visual experience presents. The upshot is that
non-relational, yet intentional, qualia are needed to explain certain intuitions about phenomenal
sameness in mental content; and representationism doesn’t have the resources to do that. There is
mental paint, and it points.
Two strong intuitions about visual experience seem to conict radically. One is that visual experiences have
discernible qualitative features, often called qualia. They are aspects of what it is like to have particular
visual experiences, subjective or felt aspects of experiences. They present themselves as intrinsic and non-
relational properties of visual experience, and they come in great detail. Almost all qualiphiles think of
qualia as introspectible. The competing intuition is that visual experience is transparent: when you attend to
a visual experience as it is going on, you will notice its objects, i.e., the things you see or apparently see,
including their apparent properties and relations, and you will notice your (diaphanous) visual relation to
those external objects and properties;  and, representationists say, that is all.

I endorse the idea that normal visual experience is transparent, both object-transparent and property-
transparent. But I want also to say that there are visual qualia, and that we can directly discern them. This
pairing of views is not usual, but I hope it will become plausible. Not to be too paradoxical at the outset, I can
say that the resolution will be that we can have two perspectives on our own experiences: in one mode of
attention, visual experience is phenomenally transparent, while in another visual qualia are discernible.

1 The Standard View of Qualia
I take the standard view to be this: normal visual experiences of the surface property of being red, which
may be a primary or secondary quality, have a distinct intrinsic and introspectible property that we may call
‘red*.’ This property is the subjective feel of those visual experiences, what it is like to have them. Red* is a
paradigm visual quale; and according to most proponents of qualia we can discern it by reecting on our
experience, and thereby be aware of it as a purely qualitative property of experience and not a property of
the ordinary objects of experience. A similar intuition, though 
not so initially obvious, reveals shape
qualia: while angularity is a feature of things out there in space, angularity* and its countless forms are
visual qualia.
p. 274
According to the standard view qualia are not in themselves, not intrinsically, representational or
intentional. A way of putting this is to say they are aspects of sensation and not, all on their own at least,
perceptual properties; you have to add something to qualia to make them into perceptual properties. Like
paint on canvas, qualia are individuated, on this view, independently of their representational or referential
properties, and—again like paint—individuated independently even of their purporting to represent,
independently of their having intentional properties even in Brentano’s sense. We can say that what the
standard view defends are raw qualia. The standard view seems to me implausible, and I will propose an
alternative.
2 Against Qualia
Qualia are not universally loved. They have been seen by many physicalists as a reactionary woolly-minded
doctrine that would impede a fully naturalistic account of the mental. Others nd them undesirable because
of their contribution to Cartesian internalism, which is supposed to lead to bad things—skepticism, or
disconnection from the world. These naturalist and anti-internalist complaints about qualia are of course
rather di|erent; but qualia-opponents of both sorts might well endorse the same remedy.
The project of getting rid of qualia has to some appeared to require philosophical work. You must argue
carefully that the idea of qualia is a mistake: perhaps the idea of qualia is initially seductive but turns out on
investigation to be incoherent (cf. ‘the’ private language argument). Quite a few philosophers have recently
suggested, however, that getting rid of qualia takes virtually no work at all: when you get right down to it
and have a good look, qualia don’t even seem to be there.
Philosophers who point out that visual experience is transparent, in the above sense, typically regard this as
incompatible with the reality of qualia. Those incompatibilists have been called ‘representationists’ and
‘intentionalists’; they hold that the phenomenology of a visual state can deliver only how the visual
experience represents external things as being. (Cf. Harman (1990); Tye (1995); Dretske (1996); Lycan
(1996).) The position to be rebutted then is this, that however scrupulously you attend to your normal visual
experience, you will not discern anything like visual qualia; all you will notice is that your visual experience
presents certain (apparent) objects and their (apparent) properties. I note that my current visual state
presents that desk and that piece of paper, their colors, shapes, and spatial relations. I can attend to nothing
else in my experience than my visual relation to some apparently perceived space, its occupants, and their
properties, including sometimes exotic, merely intentional, objects. Whoever claims to be able to spot qualia
is making things up, or (as Austin reportedly jested about Ayer’s claim to be aware of sense 
data) lying
through his teeth.  My argument will be that this incompatibilist view is not correct. There is the
phenomenon of transparency, but it is compatible with there being visual qualia as well.

3 Some Inconclusive Points on the Side of Qualia
I should say what would count as success in a defense of qualia. I take it to be a conceptual matter; and I
would be happy simply to show that qualia make sense, that they are conceivable, and that we apparently
know how to discern them in experience. It would also be nice to be able to refute philosophical arguments
to the e|ect that qualia are illusory; and I do think it is possible to answer the standard such arguments. But
in this chapter my objective is simply that qualia should make prima facie sense, and, more specically, that
this can be defended against representationist representations to the contrary.

Some have appealed to the conceivability of inverted spectra in defense of visual qualia on the standard view
of them. I imagine that you see a cucumber as having the color that I think of as ‘red.’ Does the
conceivability of inverted spectra give us qualia? The issue is phenomenological. And what I imagine when I
think of you and me as seeing the cucumber’s color di|erently in fact invites a representationist
interpretation, i.e., that what I imagine is that you and I see the cucumber as having di|erent features.  That
is about apparent properties of objects and not about qualia in our present sense, not about aspects of visual
sensation.
3
Sydney Shoemaker has proposed an elegant defense of qualia that respects the representationist
interpretation of the inverted-spectrum intuition. We imagine di|erent people seeing a certain object as
having di|erent—as it were personal—color properties. For Shoemaker (1994) our conception of qualia in
the standard sense derives from the conceivability of di|erent personal color properties. Those properties
are secondary qualities, dispositions to cause qualia. We perceive those properties as non-dispositional,
rather in the way we perceive heaviness as a non-dispositional property of objects, even though on
conceptual reection it is clear that it is dispositional. Those personal secondary qualities are what we
imagine as inverted. We do not discern qualia themselves directly: they are inferred from their making sense
of that attractive construal of inverted spectra.
Shoemaker is right in holding that the conceivability of inverted spectra does not entail introspectible
qualia. But his defense of qualia abandons what seems to me essential to qualia, that they are phenomenally
introspectible. My concept of a quale is the concept of a property that presents itself as a non-relational
feature of 
experience. This is not stipulation. I do not know what to make of the idea of a phenomenal
quality that cannot be directly attended to. I have no grip on how to conceive such a property, for a quale is a
way it is like to be in a certain state. (Some nd it intelligible that a certain conscious quale might be
instanced unconsciously. Even if this makes sense, one’s understanding of such a property would be by way
of its conscious accessibility. One would think: that could occur unconsciously—where ‘that’ is a concept
that presents a property via how it is consciously experienced. )

Let us return to the issue of whether visual qualia might present themselves as non-intentional, raw
qualitative features of visual sensations. It has been suggested that there are clear examples of raw visual
qualia at least in marginal visual experiences. Ned Block once proposed phosphenes, which appear when you
press ngers against your closed eyelids. And I have been told that recent equipment used for optical
diagnosis can splinter and isolate features of visual experience in such a way that a person is inclined to
count them as purely sensational, undirected, non-intentional features. That was my informant’s
inclination,  and I am not skeptical of the report. As for phosphenes, I do not myself experience those
features as non-intentional: to me they appear to present luminous happenings in strange spaces. But the
main point is that it is unclear that our central concern is a|ected by such examples. What might the
discernibility of exotic raw qualia imply about normal visual experience? Clearly not that we can directly
discern raw visual qualia in the ordinary case. They might lend weight to Shoemaker’s proposal: the
occurrence of isolated raw visual qualia might suggest that similar raw qualia are hidden components of
normal visual experience. But even then it would give us merely a generic conception of certain properties
hidden in ordinary visual experience without specic conceptions of them. It is not clear that this either
makes sense or would explain the point of asserting the reality of qualia if it did. The simplest and surest
way to make sense of qualia is to give them a form whereby they are discernible in all their specicity.
5
Here is an example of Christopher Peacocke’s (1983), o|ered in defense of qualia. You see two trees along a
road that stretches away from you, one tree 100 and the other 200 yards away. The trees appear the same
size. But ‘the nearer tree occupies more of your visual eld than the more distant tree.’ (I should say that
this way of putting things may suggest sense data rather than qualia.) Peacocke takes this to indicate that
there is more to notice in visual experience than its objects, and in particular that one notices aspects of the
visual experience itself. Now I am inclined to say he is right about this; one does seem here to notice aspects
of how the visual 
experience represents its objects. But it is not obvious that the example shows this on
its own. Quite reasonable representationist replies have been made by Hill (in terms of appearances) and by
Lycan (peculiar intentional objects),  and as against them I nd Peacocke’s phenomenon an inconclusive
argument for qualia. I am pessimistic about defending qualia by trying to defeat representationists at their
game. Perhaps no visual phenomenon will all on its own block a determined representationist
interpretation.  It would be nice to have a way of discerning qualia that makes representationist construals
irrelevant.

(a) Merely Intentional Objects
(b) Property Complexes
4 Phenomenal Sameness
According to the representationist, the complex property of an ordinary visual experience that exhausts its
phenomenal character consists in the subject’s visual relation to certain apparent external objects and their
apparent properties and relations. But a veridical visual experience and a visual hallucination can have
exactly the same phenomenal character, on an intuitive understanding of the latter. Can the
representationist accommodate this phenomenal sameness?
The representationist might say that there really is no sameness here, that there is no introspectible
property or even apparent property that the veridical and hallucinatory experiences have in common. There
is, I think, an intuitive point behind this, and I will return to it at the end. But there is also a strong and
compelling intuition that two such experiences are not merely indistinguishable but also share a positive
phenomenal property; and one question is whether representationism can properly describe that property.
5 Three Accounts of Hallucinations without Qualia
Some representationists, for instance Gilbert Harman (1990), construe the phenomenal similarity of a
veridical and a hallucinatory experience by invoking ‘intentional objects.’ What the two experiences have in
common are intentional objects to which they ascribe the same properties and relations. The hallucination
has what I will call a merely intentional object—it is merely an object of experience with no existence of its
own; perhaps it’s a Meinong object. I do not deny that the notion of a merely intentional object is
phenomenologically apt, or that ‘hallucinations have intentional objects’ can be a helpful manner of
speaking or convey something intuitive. The question is whether there is an inclusive notion of having an
intentional object that 
can be understood literally and that accounts for phenomenal sameness by virtue of
its applying univocally to both veridical experiences and hallucinations. It would have to invoke a single
relation that holds between visual experiences and both ordinary objects of vision and merely intentional
objects. It may be tempting to think there is such a relation. Ordinary reective phenomenology can seem to
deliver a relation of ‘presenting,’ instanced by both <this visual state, the tennis ball> and <that visual
state, the merely intentional object>. Think of it demonstratively: ‘this (diaphanous) presenting-relation
holds between visual states and both ordinary objects and merely-intentional objects.’
p. 278
But, however intuitive the idea, it is I am sure illusory. For consider this. Had the veridical visual experience
and the tennis ball not stood in a certain externally determined causal relation—a certain optical relation—
the experience would not have been of that ball. And then the intuitive ‘diaphanous’ relation would not have
held between experience and that tennis ball. But whatever that causal relation is, we can be sure it has no
merely intentional objects in its range. And if there is no common relation, we can hardly thereby have
explained what phenomenal sameness consists in. A common-sense view of the hallucination is that there is
nothing there at all, that a visual experience that lacks a real object has no object of any sort. Phenomenal
sameness must then be independent of relations to objects both ordinary and abstract.8
A more attractive explanation of phenomenal sameness is this: a visual experience, hallucinatory or
veridical, represents a complex of external properties and relations instantiated in certain patterns. These
properties are ordinary shapes, colors, spatial relations, and the like. That is what a veridical visual
experience and its hallucinatory counterpart have in common: they represent the same property complex.
Perhaps this is what some mean by the intentional content of a visual perception. (A related idea is that the
visual experience has the sense or character of a denite description, which contains a self-referring
indexical, etc.)
The objection to the property-placing account of phenomenal sameness is this: as we will see, we
apparently have no di}culty conceiving of phenomenal sameness across property-shifts and even of, as it
were, property-hallucinations. This I will argue below. If that is so, in what would phenomenal sameness
then consist? Not in represented external properties and relations. Non-qualitative resources here could
well appear to run out, if my later points about property representation are correct.

(c) Appearances
A natural proposal is that what the two experiences have in common is making true a certain single
proposition of the form it appears that p. But suppose p stands for a Russellian proposition, containing
properties, relations, connectives, quantiers. The appearance presumably has to be anchored in the
properties and relations that the visual experience actually represents. And then the proposal seems
equivalent to the property complex analysis. It might be said that appearances express Fregean propositions
or senses. But what are they? Suppose they are non-psychological entities, ‘conditions’ that the world may
or may not satisfy. It is not easy to understand this unless Fregean propositions entail relations to externally
constituted properties. But then if we can argue (as I propose to) that all such relations to external
properties can shift even though phenomenal sameness is held constant, Fregean senses will not help. On
the other hand, if one means by ‘Fregean senses’—in an unhistorical use sometimes encountered—certain
psychological factors, then we need to know more. A natural way to think of such factors is as involving in
part the very experiential factors that the representationist denies. I doubt that the appearance proposal can
get very far.
6 How to Spot Qualia
What should we look for? The question concerns normal full-blown visual experiences. As regards them, I
cannot make phenomenal sense of visual qualia that leave everything ‘intentional’ behind. I can make sense
of features of experience occurring in the absence of any or all of their normal references, whether external
objects, properties, or relations. But this does not mean that we can abstract qualia from the various ways in
which ordinary visual experiences purport-to-represent external objects, properties, and relations. The
central idea will be that visual qualia are intrinsically ‘directed.’ They are qualitative features of experience
that present themselves on reection as purporting-to-refer; but they are conceivable quite independently
of all referential properties, including their representing basic spatial properties. I will try to make sense of
this phenomenologically. The technique of qualia spotting is fairly simple. One attends to or imagines a
visual experience, and conceives of it as lacking some or all of its actual references, whether objects,
properties, or relations, and then attends to what phenomenally remains.
7 Object-directedness
p. 280
Imagine a psychology experiment in which you are visually presented rst with a lemon and then an
indistinguishable lemon-hallucination. Not only can you not distinguish these experiences, but you perhaps
have a strong inclination to think they exactly resemble each other in a certain visually detailed way. A way
of putting this is representational: the two experiences present the real lemon and a merely intentional
object as exactly similar, and that is what makes the experiences indistinguishable.
At the same time, one has a good sense of reality, and so wants to hold that the merely intentional lemon is
nothing at all, and so not something that can resemble something else. This is reected in how one engages
the two experiences. To begin with, one adopts the perspective of transparent reection. This is the
perspective on visual experiences that initially supports representationism. From this perspective, if you
have full information and a lively sense of reality, you will think di|erent things about the two experiences.
Of the veridical experience you will think ‘that lemon is real,’ and of the hallucination ‘that isn’t real;
there’s no such thing as that.’ The similarity does not consist in the two experiences’ objects, and yet they
share something object-wise. One cannot nd this shared property from the perspective of transparent
reection, given what one knows of the facts.
At this point, you can take a less engaged perspective and abstract from the real object of the veridical
experience. The two experiences ‘purport-to-refer’—call this their object-directedness. Judging that a
hallucination has the property of object-directedness is identical with judging that it has-a-merely-
intentional-object, where the latter is existentially noncommittal. It is what survives when one takes a
skeptical view of the merely-intentional object—‘that is nothing; there is no such object as that.’ That
object-directedness is a non-relational feature that the hallucination shares with the veridical lemon
sighting. And given this feature’s intimate connection with the inclination to posit merely intentional
objects, as well as with our ordinary transparent experience of real objects, it seems appropriate to call this

common phenomenal property ‘intentional.’ This way of attending to experience—discerning directedness
—I will call the perspective of oblique reection, the oblique perspective. We abstract from the objects of
experience, and attend to how the two visual experiences present their apparent objects.
Consider judging ‘this experience is of that merely intentional lemon-like object.’ Even though this is about
a visual experience one believes to be hallucinatory, it is in its way a transparent reective judgment. But it
takes little to change that transparent perspective to an oblique perspective, in fact two steps: (1) One judges
that that merely intentional object is nothing—there is no such relation as the apparently transparent
relation between this experience and that merely intentional object. (2) One then understands that the
experience has the property of its being exactly like this—and here the phenomenology is the same, or almost
the same given loss of innocence. The property of purporting-to-refer is now understood as a non-
relational 
property of the visual experience with virtually the same phenomenology as the seemingly
understood property of the experience’s standing in the transparent relation to a merely intentional object.
Discard the latter, retain the reective phenomenology as much as you can, and you have an oblique take on
the experience’s object-directedness.
p. 281
It is not as though there is one instance of directedness for each visual experience. Any normal experience is
multiply directed, to various large and small would-be particulars, parts, and empty spaces. So each such
experience has an indenite number of directed features—those that incline one to say ‘that ball,’ ‘that
sharp edge,’ and so on.
The directedness of a visual experience supports a strong disposition to refer demonstratively. But that is
not what directedness consists in; for directedness has an occurrent phenomenology, one that makes the
idea of merely intentional objects so compelling. If I am in the grip of a hallucination, it hardly does justice
to the experience to note that I am disposed to assert ‘that lemon is yellow.’
One may be tempted to suppose that demonstrative concepts play a role. The object-directedness of a
hallucination could suggest the involvement of a concept of the form ‘that object,’ dressed in visual clothes.
This could seem to explain how a visual experience can be phenomenally ‘directed’ without a real object or
an intentional object. But that idea goes beyond what I nd in the phenomenology of visual experience. My
use of ‘phenomenal directedness’ is not intended to entail the involvement of concepts. I take the interface
of perceptual organization and proper conceptualization to be a theoretical and not a phenomenological
matter. It may emerge that the phenomenology of visual experience is built on a partially conceptual
foundation. But the idea of intentional qualia or phenomenal directedness is intended to be neutral.
In what then does our concept of directedness consist? We cannot dene it, for it is a phenomenological
concept. We have a feel for what seeing a lemon shares with an indistinguishable hallucination. We can
reect on the two experiences in imagination and discern what they have in common. The proponent of
intentional qualia rejects the ontology of merely intentional objects, which are in any case useless in
explaining phenomenal sameness. We discern a non-relational phenomenal quality of visual experience
that captures that aspect of experience which makes it tempting to take merely intentional objects seriously.
From this oblique perspective we step back, withdrawing from the object-involvement of transparent
reection. The non-relational intentional phenomenal quality is found in both veridical and hallucinatory
cases. We can identify similar object-directedness throughout all normal visual experiences and in
hallucinations phenomenally identical to them. We thereby grasp the general concept of object-
directedness. Such higher-order phenomenological concepts are, I want to say, recognitional concepts,
type-demonstratives that pick out repeatable phenomena, in this case, intentional features of experience.

8 Color-directedness
p. 282
Visual experience is transparent not only to objects but also to properties and relations—colors, shapes,
relations of size, etc. If you attend to two indistinguishable visual experiences of a red thing, it is natural to
judge that they present the same color property. That is a standard representationist intuition, and it seems
right. The point to be made is that we can also take a di|erent perspective on color experience, one that
discloses a phenomenal sameness in two experiences that the representationist should regard as
representing di|erent properties. From this perspective what the two experiences have in common is a
certain phenomenal ‘property-directedness,’ which is a qualitative intentional feature of experiences,
independent of their actual property references. Property-directedness comes in a vast variety of qualitative
avors and modes. We will consider two broad categories of such phenomenal qualities of experience, in the
present section qualities of color experience, and, in the following, qualities of shape experience.
Representationists deny that surface colors are identical with dispositions to cause qualia, for they deny that
there are introspectible qualia. On their view, colors may be intrinsic properties of surfaces or perhaps
dispositions to produce in us something other than qualia. Suppose, with some representationists, that ‘red’
designates a physical surface property that is quale-independent, and that certain visual experiences
transparently represent red, that surface property. The qualiphile holds that this is compatible with the
conceivability of color qualia. To see this, we consider a simplied version of Ned Block’s Inverted Earth,
which is a Twin-Earth case for color experiences (Block (1990)). We can conceive of an Inverted-Earthian’s
having visual experiences that are phenomenally the same as our experiences of red even though her ‘red’
refers to a surface property other than red. The reduction of redness to physical surface properties is beside
the point. For the point stands even if we suppose that surface colors are irreducible non-relational
properties of surfaces over and above their basic physical properties. What the Inverted Earth thought
experiment requires is that we can conceive that those color properties systematically di|er on Earth and
Inverted Earth, even though our and our twins’ visual experiences are phenomenally the same. I take it that
we can conceive of God’s arranging that.
Block takes Inverted Earth to be an argument for the conceivability of color qualia—and so it is, I think. But
I do not see it as giving us a grip on raw color qualia. What is true is that we can conceive color-related
qualitative features of visual experience that are independent of the surface properties of objects, whatever
they may be. Those features of experience, however, are best regarded (not as raw qualia but) as property-
directed qualia.
I reect on the two experiences, one as it occurs and the other in imagination, with full knowledge of the
external facts. As regards my own experience I judge that it represents its object as red. And I imagine that
my twin’s experience on Inverted Earth does not represent its object as being red. At the same time, I
consistently 
imagine the two experiences as phenomenally the same. How shall we conceive what they
have in common? Two representationist conceptions of the common property come to mind.
p. 283
(a) Consider Shoemaker-properties again, in this case shared secondary qualities of the objects of the
two experiences. Shoemaker preserves the phenomenology by taking such properties to present
themselves as categorial properties, that being corrected when we think about them analytically.
What makes adopting this proposal interesting in the present context is that it counts what the two
experiences have in common as a shared property of their objects. As we saw above, however, that
requires hidden raw qualia, and they are di}cult to conceive.
(b) It may seem that merely intentional objects crop up not only in hallucinations, but also in the
phenomenal sameness of the color experiences we are imagining. Perhaps what the two visual
experiences have in common is a merely intentional ‘object,’ of a sort corresponding to properties
rather than particulars. That intentional object—that would-be color—presents itself as a property
of surfaces. Can we make sense of this idea? Such quasi-color-properties would be abstract objects
that are unanchored in real resemblance. We may suppose that it is as if there were such merely
intentional objects; but it is another thing to endorse them. I take our topic to be what the two
experiences actually have in common and not what it is as if they have in common. Rather than
endorse such merely intentional objects, it is better to regard what the two experiences have in
common as having a hope of psychological reality, a property of conscious experience that is a
candidate for being a real resemblance. If raw qualia were phenomenologically available they would
qualify; they are in a general way the sort of thing we are pursuing.

In the case of the lemon hallucination, I proposed trading ‘having a merely intentional object’ for the non-
relational ‘being object-directed.’ So with color qualia. I suggest that what the two color experiences have in
common is a property-directedness with a certain qualitative character. This qualitative state can in
di|erent contexts present what are in fact di|erent surface properties, perhaps even di|erent objective
colors. And it can occur even in the absence of an object, in a sort of color hallucination (cf. section 9).
Phenomenal-directedness is phenomenologically closely related to having merely intentional property
objects. If there could be such entities as merely intentional color-objects, an experience with such an
intentional object and an experience with the corresponding object-directedness would be phenomenally
indistinguishable. Still these are di|erent ideas. If one conceives a visual experience as having a color-like
merely intentional object, one’s reection on that experience is in its way from a transparent perspective.
The state of a|airs to which one attends is a would-be relation between the experience and a pseudo-
property. One could then judge: ‘there is no such entity as that merely-intentional-property, and yet this
experience 
and the experience of my twin are still like that.’ One may regard the two experiences as
sharing a property-directed quale, a way of presenting surface colors. That is how it goes for any sort of
phenomenal intentionality. One may get a grip on it by attending as if to a merely intentional object, judging
that there is no such entity there, and then noting that one can conceive of a non-relational phenomenal
quality of the experience thus: it is ‘like that,’ it has that directed color quale. These locutions should be
understood with the phenomenon in mind; they are not technical terms, but stand for how one conceives
the experience when one rejects the reality of the would-be color-property. Again, I say that we conceive of
that intentional feature from an ‘oblique’ perspective because the feature is non-relational—one reects on
the experience’s intentional and phenomenal features and not on its objects; and one is from that
perspective not immersed in the experience in the manner of transparent reection.
p. 284
A certain question about the relation of color qualia and the visual experience of shapes naturally arises at
this point. In reecting on one’s color experience one normally will also be visually presented with shapes;
and so far we have not considered how we might reect on shape experiences ‘obliquely.’ In our thought
experiment about Inverted Earth, we will apparently have to engage in a bi-perspectival frame of reection,
attending transparently to our shared visual experience’s relation to shapes and attending obliquely to the
shared color experience. How might we conceive that?
Consider the following simple limiting case, in which shape plays a vanishingly small role. Imagine looking
at a uniformly colored wall that lls your eld of vision, and also imagine your twin’s having a
phenomenally indistinguishable experience, in the presence of a wall with a di|erent surface property.
Conceive the two experiences as sharing a merely intentional quasi-color-property. This apparently
captures the shared phenomenal color-quality of the two experiences from a transparent perspective. Then
imagine judging ‘there is no such thing as that “property,”’ and also judging that ‘the two experiences are
phenomenally indistinguishable color-wise.’ In conceiving what it is like to have each of the two
experiences, conceive of it non-relationally: it is like this. Now on the face of it what they have in common is
a property-directed qualitative state. As we suggested above, this color*-property-directedness is just that
non-relational feature of the experience that replaces the intuition of a shared merely intentional quasi-
color-property. When one then regards the two experiences as presenting the wall in the same way, one
abstracts from a conception of them as experiences of a certain color-related property.
When one reects on a more complex and normal visual experience of shapes, the imaginative project
becomes more demanding, attending obliquely to color-experience and transparently to the experience of
shapes. This may in the abstract seem to require two modes of attention that do not harmonize. But perhaps
this formula will help: the two visual experiences represent a given shape; they moreover present that shape
in a certain color-wise way, which we can conceive obliquely, as if 
noting the mediation of a color lter—
although this is not a perfect analogy. If we shift back and forth determinedly, the two properties of the
experience—one relational and the other not—phenomenally coincide. But next on the agenda we have a
more radical thought experiment, which should eliminate the strain of coordinating di|erent reective
perspectives on color and shape aspects of experience.

9 Isolated Brains
Consider how visual experiences represent spatial properties. Can we hold a visual experience constant and
vary the properties that spatial* phenomenal features pick out? We require a more radical imaginative
possibility than Inverted Earth. The banal but useful thought experiment involves an isolated brain, a
phenomenal duplicate of oneself isolated from past and present ordinary contacts with our world. I will be
content if you grant at least a supercial coherence to the thought that my isolated twin-in-a-vat has visual
experiences exactly like mine. It seems to me that this is fully coherent, and, more directly to the present
point, that such an isolated brain’s experiences would not refer to, represent, spatial properties and
relations. About reference I am inclined to be completely externalist. The isolated brain does not stand in the
right relations to spatial properties for his perceptual states to refer to them. In fact I do not think we are
forced to suppose that the spatial* features of the isolated brain’s visual experience pick out any properties
or relations whatever. If that is right the isolated brain is subject to what, from the outside, may be
conceived as a radical property hallucination.
We hold something qualitative constant as we imaginatively shift or remove spatial references, i.e., the rich
phenomenal qualities of visual experience. Shape-presenting* qualia might stand for properties other than
shapes, or no properties at all. Those phenomenal qualities have a sort of directedness, like color qualia;
they are intrinsically intentional. As I conceive the isolated brain’s mental life, it is—even if devoid of
reference—as intuitively replete with intentionality as my own. Suppose its visual states fail to refer not
only to spatial properties and relations but to any properties or relations. As in the familiar case of object-
hallucination, speaking of merely intentional objects here conveys something intuitive, where by ‘objects’
we mean ersatz spatial properties and relations. But again, taking those intentional objects seriously seems
unrealistic; however intuitive they may be, they are just manners of speaking. Better to conceive the spatial*
features of the isolated brain’s visual experiences as having property-directedness and (for spatial*
features that in ordinary vision represent relations such as betweenness) relation-directedness.
How then do we conceive these complex features? We again note that merely intentional objects are
inessential to the phenomenology: we make sense of the isolated brain’s spatial* experience’s being
phenomenally the same as ours when we judge that there are no such entities as those merely intentional
property and relation-like objects. We can think: an isolated brain could have an experience just
like this,
with this spatial* intentional phenomenal quality, that intentional quality … We have to keep in mind that
our reective recognitional conceptions of these qualities are formed at varying degrees of specicity and
generality. We are able to conceive many rather di|erent spatial* features of visual experience as all being
curvy* qualia, and many more as all being spatial* qualia. These pattern recognitional abilities have
complex interrelations, up, down, and sideways, and we don’t know how we do it. That is how a quality
space is, a brute psychological phenomenon. For the isolated brain and his normal twin, what it is like to
have their experiences is the same; the intentionalized qualia of their visual experiences are the same. We
may judge: ‘this experience could be just like this even if it were not an experience of those particular objects
and did not present its particular objects as having those properties, including those spatial properties. This
is what the experience of my isolated twin would be like.’ Again, this perspective on visual experience is
from what I am calling the oblique perspective. The non-relational features one holds constant from this
perspective deserve to be called both intentional and qualia.
p. 286
10 Qualia: Inferred or Presented?
The question arises whether intentional qualia depend more on theory than on phenomenology, a
possibility that could undercut the idea that such states present themselves as features of experience. The
thought may go like this.
The idea of intentional qualia depends on our denying that the visual states of isolated brains
represent spatial properties and relations. That denial depends on theory, namely, radical
externalism about reference. But then intentional qualia are creatures of theory. And if so, how can
we conceive them phenomenologically?9
The idea perhaps is this: a philosopher who does not hold an externalist theory of reference could not think
he discerns these intentionalized qualia in his visual experience. As an internalist about reference, he holds
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/book/3115/chapter/143949518 by The Wikipedia Library user on 04 March 2023

that the references of his visual states—color properties, shapes, spatial relations—cannot shift across
environments. His account of phenomenal sameness then would presumably be the property-complex
account. Now this philosopher is going to have to say, I think, that my account of the phenomenology is just
mistaken. He will perhaps understand why I think I can discern intentional qualia, certain non-relational
features of experience. But he will count this as an illusion, stemming from my accepting externalism about
reference and then—to secure consistency—inventing exotic intentional qualia to play the role of being
whatever it is that I imagine as constant across the supposed shifts in reference. The fact is that there are no
such shifts of 
reference, he says, and, once we acknowledge this, those exotic properties will disappear.
p. 287
Now suppose one adopts agnosticism about reference-externalism. One will think that something
phenomenologically available can be held constant through the various environments, including the
isolated brain’s environment. If we are neutral about externalism we are agnostic about the nature of that
factor. If we accept externalism about perceptual reference, we will perhaps regard those features of
experience as intentional qualia. And if we accept internalism about the property-references of, say, spatial
features of experience, we will presumably construe those features as intentional property complexes, in the
sense of 5(b).
The challenge posed by the opening question can be met. Theory does have a bearing, it is true. But theory
does not create the phenomenology. From a neutral position there is a certain phenomenology of perceptual
experience. What is missing from the neutral position is a conception of the nature of what is thereby
presented. If one’s intuitions are externalist, one should regard the factor that is held constant across the
various environments as a non-relational phenomenal feature of experience. And if one shares my
skepticism about the availability of raw qualia, and nds the idea of phenomenal intentionality coherent,
one should regard the factor that is held constant as consisting in intentional qualia.
The objection we began with proposed that, because of the essential role of externalism about reference,
intentional qualia are theoretical features of experience and cannot be discerned directly. We now see what
is wrong and what is right in that. Those features are discerned directly, in all their detail, regardless of
what theory we accept. What adopting an externalist theory of reference engenders (putting aside the
previous paragraph) is an understanding of what those features are, that is, intentional qualia.
11 Intentional Qualia and Concepts
On the present conception, intentional qualia are not (merely) features of visual sensation, whatever that
might mean. We might call them ‘percepts,’ not in a theoretical sense, but simply as labeling what is
phenomenally available. And the idea does not exclude the possibility that, in some theoretical sense of
‘concept,’ intentional qualia involve concepts. Indeed I have been told that thinking of intentional qualia as
‘conceptualized qualia’ makes the idea of directedness clearer. But it is easy to be pulled in the opposite
direction. For there is also the thought that percepts are inputs to certain concepts, those concepts being
constituted by ‘subsuming’ percepts, whatever that might come to. In fact I nd this idea quite attractive.
As a piece of phenomenology, intentional qualia may help to explain why some nd the idea of the narrow
content of thoughts plausible. Narrow content must somehow be intuitively intentional. Narrow
intentionality cannot be truth conditions; for they presuppose reference to properties, which is a matter of 
externally determined relations. (Even if truth conditions are ‘characters’ or the like, they presuppose
property-references.) So the idea of thoughts having narrow contents may appear to make sense because (1)
intentional qualia are phenomenologically real, (2) they are partially constitutive of perception-based
concepts, and (3) concepts that are not directly perceptual are intentional via conceptual connections (Loar
(2003) [Chapter 15 in this volume]).

(a) Unreflective Transparency
(b) Transparent Reflection
(c) Oblique Reflection
12 Three Frames of Mind: Transparent and Oblique Perspectives
This is how ordinary in-the-world unselfconscious experience is. One sees the object directly,
phenomenologically speaking, i.e., one doesn’t see the object by attending to the visual experience, as one
might see the man by seeing the coat. But we can step back and judge that this ordinary transparency is the
upshot of—as we might say—exercising or undergoing visual percepts. When I unreectively see a tennis
ball, I undergo a corresponding percept. By undergoing that percept I have not thereby attended to it.
The following two frames of mind are the main point; they involve di|erent ways of framing attention to a
visual experience. I assume that attention involves something like concepts. The di|erence between the two
frames of mind stems from the concepts employed in the two ways of attending.
This is the reective posture that the representationist regards as the only one possible. One reects on a
visual experience, and notes that it stands in a diaphanous visual relation to a certain external state of
a|airs that consists in the instantiation of external properties and relations. One exercises perceptual
concepts (which we may think of as incorporating visual percepts), attending to external objects and their
properties and relations, as well as to one’s visual relation to those objects and properties, and not
attending to the experience’s non-relational phenomenal features.
So we understand reective transparency not only as a matter of attending to an experience and its
transparent visual relation to its objects, but also as involving certain visual perceptual concepts. These
perceptual concepts are intimately connected with visual percepts, by virtue of the latter’s being as it were
embedded—lling the empty slot—in the former, concepts of the form that object, that color, and that shape.
The rst is what we can call a singular perceptual demonstrative concept. The latter two we can call visual
recognitional concepts, or recognitional ‘type-demonstratives’ (Loar (1991b)).
The structure of a simple reectively transparent attention may then be represented like this:
p. 289
[Attention: concept of this visual experience + concept ‘is of’ + visual demonstrative concept (‘that object,’
‘that property’).]
NB: The concepts mentioned following ‘attention’ are complements of the attitude of attending: they are the
concepts employed in the attending and not the objects of that attending.
There is another manner of framing attention to a visual experience. It is the upshot, e.g., of the holding-
constant-while-imaginatively-shifting-references routine, in which one’s attention is turned reectively
on what is held constant.
[Attention: concept of this visual experience + concept ‘has’ + recognitional concept of a certain
qualitative perceptual property] namely the perceptual property that this experience has in common
with those that are phenomenally exactly similar, including those of the isolated brain. (Again the
terms in italics pick out complements of attention and not its objects.)
It appears to me evident that we are capable of this way of attending to a visual experience. Discerning
qualia is one of the two ways of framing attention to one’s visual experience; it is compatible with what
we’ve been calling the transparency of experience. The latter is not the only option, but is simply what you
nd when you adopt that attitude (of reective transparency) which is the dominant untutored manner of
reecting on one’s visual experience. The argument of this chapter has been that the less obvious attitude of
oblique reection, and the intentionalized qualia thereby noted, are also fully available.

Notes
13 Final Observations
We have characterized phenomenal sameness as it arises from the oblique perspective. Many philosophers
though have seemed to take it for granted that phenomenal sameness is found from (what I have been
calling) the transparent perspective, the perspective from which one attends to the objects of visual
experiences whether they be real or apparent. But this ‘transparent’ account of phenomenal sameness
requires objects that are hard to take seriously. These are of two sorts, what I’ve been calling merely
intentional objects, and sense data. A prevalent assumption of the sense-data tradition required abandoning
ordinary transparency in the veridical case; but that is phenomenologically unpersuasive, for phenomenal
transparency in the veridical case is di}cult to deny. The substitution of merely intentional objects avoids
that implausibility, but still posits strange objects to account for hallucinations; but such objects o|end
against common sense, which says there is nothing there at all. It is an 
illusion that phenomenal
sameness of veridical and hallucinatory experiences can be discerned from the transparent perspective; in
the case of a hallucination one should simply judge that there is nothing there. If that is so phenomenal
sameness can be intelligibly discerned only from the oblique perspective; and it consists in resemblance in
intentional qualia.
p. 290
If a philosopher agrees about merely intentional objects and sense data, and yet cannot nd in his
experience what I call oblique reection and intentional qualia, he will have to say that veridical and
hallucinatory experiences have nothing in common that can be pointed to in experience. Two experiences
would be indistinguishable from the rst-person perspective even though one experience presents an
actual state of a|airs and the other presents nothing at all. In denying that there is a positive phenomenal
sameness here, this is related to ‘disjunctivism’ (cf. Snowdon (1981); McDowell (1986)). If it is right, and all
that is available is the transparent perspective, it would be reasonable to treat the two experiences quite
di|erently.  But the sense of positive phenomenal sameness is compelling, will not go away, and begs for a
coherent rendition. That is provided by the idea of intentional qualia, and the oblique perspective that
reveals them.
10
Should the reality of intentional qualia raise fears of our being isolated from the world? Skepticism itself is
the product of epistemological views, and the right way with it is to attack them. There is no point in
eviscerating the mind to x epistemologists’ mistakes. As for our sense of connection to the world, it is the
upshot of a bit of phenomenology, that is, the transparent perspective on experience. Is this sense of
connection compromised by the availability of the oblique perspective? That is a nice complex question.
Worries about the divergence of the lived world and science’s world arise, in part, from the availability of a
phenomenal realm that has its own integrity. Whether such worries can be assuaged is still an open
question. But it is rather implausible to answer it by denying the availability of phenomenal sameness.11
Confusingly, these properties are also called ʻqualiaʼ by some philosophers (e.g., Dretske, Lycan). But here the term is
reserved for qualitative features of experience itself.

I owe this anecdote to Laurent Stern.
2
If the proponent of qualia has an independent argument for the conceivability of qualia, then of course he will also have a
direct account of inverted spectra. The point here is that inverted spectra on their own are not a compelling argument for
qualia.
3
Another worry about Shoemakerʼs account of qualia is that there seems to be a dixerence between heaviness and
personal color properties. In the former case, we have a direct awareness of a qualitative state; we can conceive of what it
is like to pick up something heavy. But according to Shoemaker we do not have a direct awareness of color qualia. In the
former case there is a reason to identify the property of heaviness with a disposition to produce in one a certain
qualitative state, and there is no similar direct reason to identify personal color properties with dispositions to cause color
qualia.

6
Visual blur is a case in point. It seems reasonable to say that a blurred viewing of a scene might be visually equivalent to a
clear view of a scene that is in itself ʻblurry.ʼ
7
Further possibilities come to mind: (a) There are two relations in the veridical case that extensionally coincide—one causal
and the other more ethereal, whose range includes both ordinary and Meinong objects. Believe it if you can. (b) As in (a)
but where the additional relation is ʻdeflationary.ʼ It will be a struggle to say how such a deflationary reference relation can
have both ordinary and abstract objects in its range (given that the states in its domain are all visual experiences).

Moreover, as is well known, deflationary reference relations are not counterfactually sensitive in the right way. (c) There is
a relation that somehow supervenes both on that optical relation and on some relation that holds between visual
experiences and mere intentional objects. This is a tall order. Producing the two subvenient relations (the ordinary causal
one, and some relation to abstract objects) will not, it seems to me, explain phenomenal sameness. If the supervenient
relation is to help, it would have to explain phenomenal sameness intuitively, even if the two subvenient relations do not
do so. (Keep in mind that it is essential to the transparency thesis that the veridical experience should not have both a real
intentional object and a Meinong object.) I do not think such a supervenient relation can be made sense of.
Thanks to Barry Smith, and to Scott Sturgeon, for raising versions of this question.
9
But suppose the opaque perspective were not available. Then perhaps a coherent conception of isolated brains would not
be available. And in that case the reason given in the text for rejecting the property-complex account of phenomenal
sameness would not be available. Ned Block has suggested to me that McDowellʼs disjunctive view seems to overlook the
view that what the two experiences have in common is that they represent the same property complex. It might be replied
that property complexes are not particular states of axairs, and that the disjunctive view can be taken to deny merely that
hallucinations involve relations to phenomenally available states of axairs.
