Learnability, representation, and language: A Bayesian

Abstract
Within the metaphor of the “mind as a computation device” that dominates cognitive
science, understanding human cognition means understanding learnability – not only
what (and how) the brain learns, but also what data is available to it from the world.
Ideal learnability arguments seek to characterize what knowledge is in theory possible
for an ideal reasoner to acquire, which illuminates the path towards understanding
what human reasoners actually do acquire.
The goal of this thesis is to exploit
recent advances in machine learning to revisit three common learnability arguments
in language acquisition. By formalizing them in Bayesian terms and evaluating them
given realistic, real-world datasets, we achieve insight about what must be assumed
about a child’s representational capacity, learning mechanism, and cognitive biases.
Exploring learnability in the context of an ideal learner but realistic (rather than
ideal) datasets enables us to investigate what could be learned in practice rather
than noting what is impossible in theory. Understanding how higher-order inductive
constraints can themselves be learned permits us to reconsider inferences about innate
inductive constraints in a new light.
And realizing how a learner who evaluates
theories based on a simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt tradeoﬀcan handle sparse evidence may
lead to a new perspective on how humans reason based on the noisy and impoverished
data in the world. The learnability arguments I consider all ultimately stem from the
impoverishment of the input – either because it lacks negative evidence, it lacks a
certain essential kind of positive evidence, or it lacks suﬃcient quantity of evidence
necessary for choosing from an inﬁnite set of possible generalizations. I focus on these
learnability arguments in the context of three major topics in language acquisition:
the acquisition of abstract linguistic knowledge about hierarchical phrase structure,
the acquisition of verb argument structures, and the acquisition of word leaning biases.

Acknowledgements
In some ways, this section is the one that I have the most trepidation about writing,
both because I feel some pressure to be witty, and because I lack the eloquence to
capture how much some of these people have helped me over the years. I’m also afraid
of forgetting somebody: there is truly quite a list.
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Josh Tenenbaum. I entered
his lab with a passionate if somewhat inchoate interest in many issues in language
acquisition and cognitive development, and he helped me turn that into a well-deﬁned
set of questions and an interesting research program. When I arrived I knew relatively
little about abstract computational theory, and even less about Bayesian modelling:
only enough to think that they seemed to be promising and important tools for
understanding induction and higher cognition. I have learned a truly tremendous
amount from him about these topics. More profoundly, he has taught me, by example,
how to be a scientist: how to communicate your ideas to others; how to strike the
diﬃcult balance between safe (but necessary) research and less-certain, more risky,
questions; how to recognize a bad or fruitless idea before spending weeks or months
investing time in developing it; and how to nurture the good ideas, even if they aren’t
yet fully worked out. In the process, he also taught me a little something about being
a good person as well. I remember once I was talking to him about many of the
structural diﬃculties inherent in sometimes doing good research – the necessity for
funding, the tendency of ﬁelds to get sucked into myopic ways of thinking, etc – and
ﬁnally he said, “I think you have to be the change you want to see.” That’s a clich´e,
but it’s a good clich´e, and Josh lives it: if you don’t like something, try to change it:
slowly, organically, from the inside. I try to emulate that about him.
The members of my committee – Ted Gibson, Laura Schulz, and Lila Gleitman –
each aﬀected me in their own way as well. Ted has an unparalleled (and extremely
refreshing) ability to see through bullshit1, coupled with the courage to call it out
in no uncertain terms. I have beneﬁted over the years from his thoughts about the
1Is cursing allowed in dissertations? I hope so, because no other word seems appropriate here.

intersection of linguistics and cognitive science, as well as his broader perspective
about academia and how all of our research ﬁts into the developing narrative of the
ﬁeld. Laura has been a consistent source of insight about the relevance of my work to
the issues in developmental psychology, and has (very usefully) prodded me to think
about these ideas in a broader, more big picture context. And I count myself to have
been extremely lucky to have beneﬁted from the ideas and insights of Lila Gleitman,
who has been doing groundbreaking work on these issues for longer than I have been
alive. When I ﬁrst met her at a conference I was somewhat intimidated, but it only
took a few thought-provoking, wide-ranging, and immensely engaging conversations
for the intimidation to be replaced by something far more valuable. In her incisive
intellect, irreverent attitude, and sharp focus on the interesting questions, she also is
somebody I seek to emulate.
I have had many other academic inﬂuences, too many to list in their entirety, but
some deserve unique mention. Several pre-college teachers (Bonnie Barnes, Marge
Morgenstern, Jon Dickerson, Kathy Heavers, among others) fed a love for learning
that has lasted me my whole life. Anne Fernald, my undergraduate advisor, is prob-
ably the main person responsible for taking my initial interest in cognitive science
questions and showing me how one could study them scientiﬁcally. She was an in-
spirational mentor and source of support at a time when I greatly needed both. Fei
Xu taught me a great deal about not only the important details of doing experi-
mental work on infants, but also imbued me with a much richer sense of the issues
and questions as they appear from an empirical developmental perspective. Due to
her generosity in inviting me to spend several months in the UBC Baby Cognition
lab, among colleagues with an interest in similar issues as me but a very diﬀerent
approach to solving them, my intellectual boundaries were greatly expanded. Thanks
in part to her inﬂuence, I now have a much deeper fascination with issues about
early conceptual structure and essentialism, and I hope to explore them in the future.
Another source of intellectual growth has been my coauthors, Terry Regier and Liz
Wonnacott, each in their own way: Terry for his penetrative ability to hone in on
and identify the real issues and interesting questions, Liz for her ability to ground my
6

theoretical approach in the important empirical questions, as well as her friendship.
I have also been lucky enough to beneﬁt from interesting, provocative conversations
with a wide range of people, whose serious consideration of my ideas and the issues
has greatly enhanced my thinking: Robert Berwick, who has kept me honest, and
from whom I have learned a great deal of mathematical learnability theory and the
history of the ﬁeld of linguistics; Jay McClelland and JeﬀElman, both of whom have
caused me to think much more deeply about the relations between and contributions
of Bayesian methods, PDP models, and dynamical systems; and many, many others,
including Adam Albright, Tom Griﬃths, Steven Pinker, Ken Wexler, Danny Fox,
Morten Christiansen, Jesse Snedeker, Susan Carey, Linda Smith, and Dan Everett.
Many of my colleagues associated with the Computational Cognitive Science Lab
have also had a profound eﬀect on my thinking.
Charles Kemp, a coauthor, has
been a tremendous source of instruction in everything from the nitty-gritty details
of computational modelling to the deepest, most intractable questions in cognitive
science.
He has been one of my favorite sparring partners over the years, and is
also a source of some of my favorite memories – road-tripping to Vermont, stumbling
around Italy, listening to Bach cantatas in church. Mike Frank has inspired me with
his ability to come up with simple and elegant ways to investigate deep and interesting
problems, and several conversations with him have helped to crystallize issues in my
mind. Vikash Mansinghka, despite having a last name that I can never remember
how to spell, has also been an inspiration for his energy, deeply penetrating intellect,
and profound moral sensibility (though he would probably laugh to know I said that
about him). Noah Goodman and Tim O’Donnell have been great sources of insight
about computation and linguistics. Liz Baraﬀ-Bonawitz is not only a friend but also
a powerful example to me of what sort of good science can emerge from somebody
with wide-ranging interests, an incredible work ethic, and the passion and intensity
to make it happen.
And ﬁnally, I really couldn’t have done this without Lauren
Schmidt: her support when things went wrong, her encouragement when things went
well, her scientiﬁc insights, her capacity for fun, her personal friendship. I will miss her
tremendously. Many others, too many to list (but including Sara Paculdo, Virginia
7

Savova, Ed Vul, Steve Piantadosi, Ev Fedorenko, Konrad Koerding, and Mara Breen),
have helped in other ways.
On a more personal level, no acknowledgements section would be complete without
mentioning my partner, Toby Elmhirst. He has helped me in pretty much every way a
person can be helped. Intellectually, he has given me the perspective of an intelligent
analysis from the perspective of another ﬁeld (in this case, mathematical biology),
which has provided me with a much richer sense of how the deep issues in one area
of human endeavor are closely related to the issues in other. He is my favorite person
to talk to about any topic, scientiﬁc and otherwise, and I consider myself profoundly
lucky to have found somebody with whom conversation never gets old. Emotionally,
he has been my strength when things were tough, and has shared my joy when they
were not. If I were to dedicate this thesis to anybody, it would be to him.
I also could not ﬁnish this without thanking my family. My parents, George and
Diane Perfors, have inﬂuenced me in all the ways good parents should. I ﬁrst realized
how to think and how to be intellectually honest from them; how to take joy in the
small things; to treasure the outdoors and small towns; and to realize that everybody,
from the most famous scientist to the lowest beggar, can have something to teach.
Because of their inﬂuence, I learned to trust in myself and not be swayed by fashion
or superﬁcial pressures (or, at least, to try not to be). It has been a great source
of emotional strength to know that their love and support are not conditioned on
earning a PhD, being a scientist, or doing anything in particular. My siblings (Dave,
Tracy, Steve, and Julie) have not only been lifelong friends, but also a consistent
source of perspective and joy. This PhD and these academic pursuits, which I truly
love and I do think are very interesting, are still much less important than family and
friends and the rest of life. And I thank them for continuously reminding me of that;
ironically, I think it may even have made the science a bit better.
I know every acknowledgements section since the dawn of time says this, but that
is because it is so true: in a very real sense, this research is not the product of one
person’s toil, but the result of many, many people’s eﬀorts. This is where I get to say
thank you to them.

Chapter 1
The problem of learnability
Cognitive science views the mind from a computational perspective: as a thinking
machine that, given some input, performs computations on it and produces a be-
havior. Within this paradigm, which is broadly accepted by almost every cognitive
scientist nowadays, the fundamental questions are centered on the nature of the data
in the world and the nature of the computations the mind can perform.
As a result, the subject of learnability is of fundamental importance. If we want
to understand what computations the mind performs, we must understand its depen-
dence on data – which means understanding both what data exists and how the mind
might be able to use and learn from it. This is diﬃcult in part because both of these
unknowns are deeply enmeshed with each other: what data exists depends in part on
how the mind operates, and how the mind performs may depend to some extent on
what data it receives. Data depends on the mind because it is only available to the
extent that the brain is capable of perceiving and interpreting it: a newborn child
would not receive the same eﬀective data as a newborn even if we could ensure that
every aspect of their environment was identical, since a three-year-old can understand
and use the input (e.g., the ambient language) in a way that a newborn cannot. Con-
versely, the mind depends on data in some ways. Every normal brain has the same
potential capacity, but exercising that capacity may require the correct input; a child
never exposed to English will not be able to produce or understand it.
These may look like trivial observations, but that is because they are focused on
13

the extremes. Unfortunately for us, most of cognition does not operate at the extremes
– and that hazy middle ground is where it becomes diﬃcult to tease apart which aspect
of behavior is due to the brain and which is due to the data. In some ways, in fact,
such a question verges on incoherence, since everything is cumulative: what the mind
is like at birth inﬂuences the eﬀective data the brain receives, which in turn aﬀects
what is learned, which then further shapes the eﬀective data, and so on. The fact
that human cognition doesn’t appear to be highly sensitive to initial conditions in
the way that many feedback loops are doesn’t mean that cognitive scientists need not
worry about cumulative eﬀects; it might simply imply that everyone’s brain and/or
environment are broadly comparable enough in the relevant respects that the feedback
loop operates quite similarly for all.
Another complication lies in the fact that learnability and representation are in-
timately intertwined. Whether something is learnable depends a great deal on what,
precisely, is thought to be learned: do children avoid certain ungrammatical construc-
tions because they have abstracted some form of structured syntactic knowledge, or
because they have implicitly learned associations involving unstructured representa-
tions? In general, as representational system grows in expressivity, it should be more
diﬃcult to learn within that system, so more may need to be built in from the start.
But if what is built in is a powerful learning mechanism, does this count as “nature”
or “nurture”? And if the representation is quite expressive and powerful, does this
count as building in a lot (because it is so complicated) or a little (because the space
of unknowns is larger)?
Thus arises the perennial debates about nature and nurture. The simplistic view
that both nature and nurture are important is – however true – not very constructive
or explanatory from the scientiﬁc point of view.
A major challenge in cognitive
science, therefore, is to move beyond both extremes as well as this glib middle ground.
We must work to elucidate exactly how innate biases and domain-general learning
might interact to guide development in diﬀerent domains of knowledge.
The study of ideal learnability is a valuable means towards that end. Ideal learn-
ability arguments focus on the question of whether something is learnable in principle,
14

given the data: that is, they are more focused on the nature of the input than on
the nature of the mind. The two cannot be completely disentangled for all of the
reasons we have already considered – and those issues often prove to be the rocks
against which the waves of disagreement break – but ideal learnability analyses at
least provide a path towards answering what looks like an otherwise nearly intractable
question.
What does it mean to be learnable in principle? After all, everything is learnable
in the sense that it is possible to make some machine that can “learn” it by simply
building it in.
Learnability analysis attempt to avoid this intellectual vacuity by
describing the characteristics of an ideal learner and then evaluating whether it could
acquire the knowledge under consideration. This approach guides inquiry in a fruitful
direction by suggesting a series of precise, testable questions: do humans really have
the hypothesized characteristics? Are the assumptions made about the data accurate?
Do the ways in which the analysis departs from reality prove critically important?
If so, why? If not, why not? One value of learnability analyses is that they provide
a way of converting intractable, vague questions like “is it nature or nurture?” into
tractable, empirically resolvable ones.
That means, of course, that a learnability analysis is only as good as the as-
sumptions it makes about the data and the learner. Formal mathematical proofs
are valuable starting points but often have limited applicability because the assump-
tions they make in order to be mathematically tractable can be quite distant from
the characteristics of human learners. Non-mathematical analyses, by contrast, have
historically been somewhat constrained by technical limitations on their ability to
evaluate the behavior of a powerful learner on a complex real-world dataset. Because
of the diﬃculty in gathering and manipulating large datasets of realistic input, they
frequently involve educated but intuitive guesses about what data would be relevant
as well as how rich the data really is. Because they are often not formalized they
may either contain implicit suppositions about the nature of the postulated learning
mechanism, or draw vague or unjustiﬁed conclusions about what precisely must be
innate. And because they are seldom implemented and tested, it can be diﬃcult to
15

objectively evaluate what might actually be learned by given their assumptions.
Recent advances in machine learning and computer science provide a way to sur-
pass some of these limitations. In this thesis I exploit these advances to revisit three
of the most common learnability arguments in linguistics and cognitive science. The
Bayesian framework I use produces novel answers for some of the speciﬁc questions
to which these arguments have applied. More broadly, it yields insight about the
types of conclusions that can be drawn from this sort of argumentation, and why.
And in each case, it fulﬁlls one of the primary goals of an ideal learnability analysis
– providing a set of precise, empirically testable questions and predictions.
In the subsequent sections I review each of the three common learnability argu-
ments this thesis is focused on. I describe the abstract logic of each with the goal of
clarifying what assumptions are made and what conclusions may be validly drawn. I
then discuss three areas in language acquisition, corresponding to Chapters 3, 5, and
4, where we see these learnability arguments play out. These chapters analyze the
learnability claims with respect to the speciﬁc examples and evaluate the implications
for other arguments with the same logical structure.
Three learnability problems
Problem #1: The Poverty of the Stimulus
Plato’s dialogue Meno introduces us to the sophistic paradox, also known as the
problem of knowledge: “man cannot enquire either about that which he knows, or
about that which he does not know; for if he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if
not, he cannot; for he does not know the very subject about which he is to enquire.”
Socrates’ solution to this dilemma is to suggest that all knowledge is in the soul from
eternity and simply forgotten at birth: learning is simply remembering what was
already innately present. His conclusion is based on one of the ﬁrst Poverty of the
Stimulus (PoS) arguments, in which he demonstrates that a slave-boy who had never
been taught the fundamentals of geometry nevertheless grasps them.
16

PoS arguments like this are used quite generally to infer the existence of some
innate knowledge, based on the apparent absence of data from which the knowledge
could have been learned. This style of reasoning is as old as the Western philosophical
tradition. Leibniz’ argument for an innate ability to understand necessary truths,
Hume’s argument for innate mechanisms of association, and Kant’s argument for an
innate spatiotemporal ordering of experience are all used to infer the prior existence of
mental capacities based on an apparent absence of support for acquiring them through
learning. Thus, the Poverty of the Stimulus is both a problem for the learner – how to
generalize based on limited or impoverished data – as well as a method for research:
identifying where data is impoverished can be a useful step toward identifying what
knowledge must be innate. The logical structure of the PoS argument is as follows:
1.1. (i) Children show a speciﬁc pattern of behavior B.
(ii) A particular generalization G must be grasped to produce behavior B.
(iii) It is impossible to reasonably induce G simply on the basis of the data D
that children receive.
(iv) ∴Some abstract knowledge T, limiting which speciﬁc generalizations G are
possible, is necessary.
This form of the PoS argument is applicable to a variety of domains and datasets
both within and across linguistics. Unlike other standard treatments (Laurence &
Margolis, 2001; Pullum & Scholz, 2002), it makes explicit the distinction between mul-
tiple levels of knowledge – a distinction which we will see again and again throughout
this thesis. An advantage of this logical schema is to clarify that the correct conclu-
sion given the premises is not that the higher-level knowledge T is innate, only that
it is necessary. The following corollary is required to conclude that T is innate:
1.2. (i) (Conclusion from above) Some abstract knowledge T is necessary.
(ii) T could not itself be learned, or could not be learned before the speciﬁc
generalization G is known.
(iii) ∴T must be innate.
17

The problem of the Poverty of the Stimulus is the most general of the three learn-
ability problems discussed in this thesis; in fact, it would not be inaccurate to say that
the other two are simply special cases. Saying that the stimulus is impoverished with
respect to some generalization is synonymous with saying that the generalization is
not learnable without presuming that the learner has access to some speciﬁc abstract
knowledge T. Learnability arguments diﬀer from one another based on how they an-
swer the question of precisely why or in what way the data is impoverished. Many PoS
arguments – including the classic one about hierarchical phrase structure in language,
which I discuss in Chapter 3 – focus on a lack of a certain kind of positive evidence,
which is otherwise perceived as necessary for ruling out incorrect generalizations or
hypotheses. This sort of PoS argument could apply even if only a ﬁnite amount of
data would otherwise be necessary: it is about the nature of the data, rather than
the amount of it.
By contrast, the No Negative Evidence and the Feature Relevance problems –
the other two problems addressed in this thesis – gain most of their logical force
because no human learner sees an inﬁnite amount of data. In short, they are more
about quantity of data than quality (especially in the case of the Feature Relevance
problem). A lack of negative evidence would not be a problem, at least in the limit, if
a dataset were inﬁnite in size,1 because a learner could simply assume that if certain
input is unattested, that is because it is not allowed. For a similar reason, the Feature
Relevance problem is only unresolvable in principle if there are an inﬁnite number of
features that could possibly be relevant – otherwise, in theory at least, a learner could
simply eliminate the irrelevant features one-by-one.
Problem #2: No Negative Evidence
In a seminal 1967 paper, mathematician E. Mark Gold provided a mathematical anal-
ysis of learnability in the limit. His question was whether a learner with an inﬁnite
amount of linguistic data would be able to converge on the correct language (that is,
1This is true assuming a hypothesis space that is inﬁnite in size, which (as we will see later) is
the case with many interesting acquisition problems.
18

eventually produce only grammatical strings of that language). Gold considered sev-
eral variations on the basic paradigm, but for our purposes, the relevant ones concern
diﬀerences how linguistic information is presented. In one variation, an informant
presents the learner with a list of strings and labels each as grammatical (positive
evidence) or ungrammatical (negative evidence). In the other variation, the learner
is simply shown a list of strings under the assumption that all are grammatical. Both
versions incorporate the constraint that each string occurs at least once, but no other
assumptions about the presentation are made.
The learning algorithm involves successively testing and eliminating candidate
grammars.
After each string, the learner decides whether that string could have
been generated by its current grammar. If so, the grammar is retained; if not, it is
discarded, and a new one is chosen. Because the listener is assumed to have a perfect
memory, the new grammar will always be one that can generate not only the current
string, but also all of the previous strings that have been. In many ways, this learner
has more advantages than any human being: in addition to its perfect memory and
ability to match new grammars on the ﬂy to all of the strings it has already seen, its
input contains no errors.
In spite of this, it turns out that only languages of ﬁnite cardinality are learnable
from positive evidence alone. The reason is that for any inﬁnite language it is impos-
sible to determine how to generalize beyond the strings that have been seen. If the
learner were to select a grammar that produced all and only those strings, it might
miss a string that is in the language but has not yet appeared; but if it were to choose
a grammar that could produce some string(s) that had not been seen, they might not
be in the language after all. Only if the language is ﬁnite can the learner converge on
a grammar that produces all and only the strings in the language.
This poses a problem from the point of view of language acquisition in humans,
since human languages are not ﬁnite (Chomsky, 1959). If even a learner with a perfect
memory and errorless input can’t acquire the correct grammar, how do children do
it? One possibility might be that they receive both positive and negative evidence;
Gold’s analysis showed that under such conditions, the classes of languages that
19

include English are all learnable. The problem is that there is little substantiation
for the idea that children actually receive much negative evidence (e.g., Brown &
Hanlon, 1970; Newport, Gleitman, & Gleitman, 1977; Pinker, 1989), and if they do,
not much indication that they notice or use it (McNeill, 1966; Braine, 1971). At most,
some studies suggest that there are slight diﬀerences in the frequency of parents’
corrections of well-formed vs. ill-formed utterances (e.g., Bohannon & Stanowicz,
1988; Chouinard & Clark, 2003), which – even if the child could use it to ﬁgure out
what aspect of the utterance was ill-formed – is still probably not suﬃcient to reject
all of the possible incorrect grammars (Gordon, 1990; Marcus, 1993).
In general, Gold’s theorem demonstrates that without some constraint on the
space of languages or the procedure used to learn them – or both – language ac-
quisition from positive-only evidence is impossible. What sort of constraints might
help? Gold shows that certain restrictions on the order of presentation can make even
recursively enumerable languages learnable. Unfortunately, these restrictions (which
require the presentation to be generated by a primitive recursive function) are implau-
sible when applied to human language learning. Theorists have explored many other
avenues, and I will give two in particular more detailed attention: allowing grammars
to be probabilistic, and incorporating a less stringent standard of learnability.2
There are many ways to incorporate a less stringent learnability standard (e.g.,
J. Feldman, 1972; Wharton, 1974), but one of the most well-developed and useful is
the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework introduced by Valiant (1984).
The PAC approach translates the learnability problem into the language of statistical
learning theory, so that each language is associated with an indicator function that
maps each of the strings to a real number between 0 and 1 (where a 1 indicates that the
string belongs in the language). In order to be able to evaluate “how close” a language
is to the correct one, a distance metric is imposed on the space of languages – so that
instead of scoring 1 if the learner has guessed the correct language and 0 otherwise,
the learner “gets credit” for being close. A class of languages is learnable within this
framework only if it has ﬁnite VC dimension (Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 1971); this
2See (P. Niyogi, 2006) for an overview.
20

implies, remarkably, that even ﬁnite languages (as well as regular and context-free
languages) are not learnable in the PAC setting. Although some languages are PAC
learnable but not Gold learnable, it does not seem as if we can rely on PAC learning
to solve the learnability problem.
What about allowing grammars to be probabilistic? It might seem that this would
facilitate learning, and indeed it does in certain special cases, but in the abstract it
actually makes the problem harder:3 rather than having to simply converge on the
correct set of grammatical rules (or the correct extension of sentences, as in Gold’s for-
mulation), the learner must now converge on the correct set of rules and probabilities.
In fact, if nothing is known a priori about the nature of the probability distribu-
tion on rules – call it µ – then making the languages stochastic does not expand the
class of learnable languages at all (Angluin, 1988; P. Niyogi, 2006). If, however, we
can make certain assumptions about µ, then the entire class of recursively enumer-
able languages – which includes human languages – becomes learnable (Osherson,
Stob, & Weinstein, 1986; Angluin, 1988). Are these assumptions plausible for human
language?
It is diﬃcult to be certain, but many have argued that they are probably not.
The essential idea is that µ must be a member of a family of approximately uniformly
computable distributions (Angluin, 1988). A family of distributions is approximately
uniformly computable if the distribution on the strings so far can be approximated
within some error by every individual µi in the family. This imposes a fairly stringent
constraint: for instance, probability measures are obtained on context-free grammars
by tying the probabilities to context-free rules. This imposes an exponential-decay dis-
tribution in which longer strings are exponentially less frequent than shorter strings.
As a result, a learner who (correctly) assumes that the distribution is of this form will
converge to the correct context-free grammar (Horning, 1969), but a learner assuming
an arbitrary distribution may not.
3The same general point applies to the idea of jointly learning grammars (i.e., syntax) and
meanings (i.e., semantics) - this simply makes the space larger. It may be possible that syntax and
semantics might mutually constrain each other in such a way that it is easier to learn both, but this
is not obviously true.
21

Horning’s work is interesting not only because it demonstrates a positive learn-
ability result for context-free grammars – albeit one that depends on the assumption
that individual strings follow a exponential-decay probability distribution – but also
because it incorporates notions from Bayesian probability theory, which is related to
research in information theory based on the notion of Minimum Description Length
(MDL). Both Bayesian and MDL approaches are based on the insight that incorpo-
rating a simplicity metric can provide a way to choose among all of the grammars (or,
more generically, hypotheses) that are consistent with the data. Indeed, a remarkable
proof by Solomonoﬀ(1978) demonstrates that a learner that incorporates a certain
simplicity metric will be able to predict any computable sequence with an error that
approaches zero as the size of the dataset goes to inﬁnity (see also Solomonoﬀ, 1964;
Rissanen & Ristad, 1992; Chater & Vit`anyi, 2007). This is in some sense the perfect
universal prediction algorithm. The drawback? It is not computable, meaning that it
would take an inﬁnite amount of time to calculate. Thus, although it is reassuring in
an ideal sense, this says little about how children actually overcome the No Negative
Evidence problem.
A diﬀerent idea, called the Subset Principle, suggests that children manage to
learn from positive-only evidence by ranking their hypothesis grammars in such a
way that they can be disconﬁrmed by positive examples (Berwick, 1985). Thus, they
would consider the narrowest languages ﬁrst – i.e., grammars whose extensions are
strict subsets of all of the grammars later in the ordering – and only if those gram-
mars were disconﬁrmed would the next largest grammar be evaluated. According to
mathematical learning theory, the Subset Principle is both necessary and suﬃcient
for convergence to the correct language (at least in the limit). Problem solved? Un-
fortunately, no: it does not explain certain empirical phenomena of overgeneralization
in language – people simply do not seem to be conservative learners in the way that
a Subset Principle based learner would be. But how, then, do human learners solve
the No Negative Evidence problem?
22

Problem #3: Feature Relevance
The problem of determining Feature Relevance, which is related but logically distinct
from the No Negative Evidence problem, was ﬁrst explicated by early philosophers.
In one classic thought experience, Quine (1960) asked readers to imagine they were
an anthropologist visiting a remote tribe, trying to learn the language. One day he
sees a rabbit run by, and a one of the tribesman points to it, saying “gavagai.” Can
he infer that “gavagai” means rabbit? It certainly seems the natural conclusion, but
there are logically an inﬁnite number of possible meanings: it might mean rabbit fur,
undetached rabbit parts, rabbit running on grass, soft furriness in motion, or even
the abstract concept of rabbits, as a species or general type, here represented by this
example. In fact, even if some meanings are ruled out by context, there will always
remain an inﬁnite number of possibilities consistent with the observations so far.
Goodman (1955) discussed a similar issue in the context of the famous “grue”
problem.
In this example, one problem of induction (determining the referent of
a word) is replaced by another (determining the extension of a predicate). Having
observed that all emeralds examined thus far are green, it is tempting to conclude
that all future emeralds will also be green, particularly as one observes more and
more green emeralds. Yet, as Goodman pointed out, it is equally true that every
emerald that has been observed is grue: emerald before time t, and ruby after time t
(assuming t has not yet occurred). Why, then, do we not conclude that emeralds are
grue rather than green?
Both of these classic problems of induction have the a similar ﬂavor: how to
identify the correct hypothesis out of a potentially inﬁnite set of possibilities. In
some ways, the No Negative Evidence problem grapples with a similar issue as these,
but it is important to note that it is logically distinct. The Feature Relevance problem
is about how one decides which of an inﬁnite number of dimensions or features are
relevant to generalize along: Color? Color at time t? Color before and after time
t? Objecthood? Furriness? Grassiness? The No Negative Evidence problem, by
contrast, would apply even if there were only one feature: it is a question about how,
23

and to what extent, one should generalize beyond that input in the feature(s) already
identiﬁed as relevant. This is an important distinction to keep in mind because the
two problems are often conﬂated, leading to confusion about what has and hasn’t
been resolved.
Overview
All three of these learnability problems are essentially Poverty of the Stimulus prob-
lems at root: they simply diﬀer in terms of the way in which the data is impoverished.
The Feature Relevance problem arises from the fact that no ﬁnite dataset contains suf-
ﬁcient quantity of input to rule out which of an inﬁnite number of possible features
it should be generalized along. The No Negative Evidence problem arises because
without negative evidence,, a learner cannot decide among all of the hypotheses that
are consistent with the input. It diﬀers from the Feature Relevance problem because
the issue is no longer in deciding which of an inﬁnite number of possible features are
relevant; the issues is that, even given the feature (e.g., formal syntax in Gold’s origi-
nal formulation), it is impossible to logically eliminate hypotheses that overgeneralize
beyond the input. Both of the Feature Relevance problem and the No Negative Evi-
dence problem are PoS problems that depend critically on hypothesis spaces that are
inﬁnite in size. Another kind of PoS problem emerges from the lack of a certain kind
of positive data, and would exist even if the hypothesis space were ﬁnite. Thus, al-
though each of the three learnability problems are related, they are also distinct, and
throughout this thesis we will see how these distinctions play out among particular
examples in acquisition.
One commonality among all of these learnability problems – indeed, all learnability
problems in general – is that they are simultaneously a problem and a method: a
problem confronting a learner, and a method for the scientist to infer what sort of
knowledge must be assumed in order to solve the problem. This knowledge takes the
form of higher-order constraints (T) of some sort which, following Goodman (1955) I
will sometimes also refer to as overhypotheses. The logic of these learnability problems
requires only that some higher-order constraint exists, not that it be innate, although
24

it can be diﬃcult to imagine a way in which it might be learned (especially before the
lower-level knowledge it is meant to constrain).
Many types of higher-order constraints have been hypothesized in diﬀerent do-
mains and for diﬀerent learning problems. All that the logical of the argument re-
quires is that there be some constraint, not that it be domain-speciﬁc, nor even that
it be knowledge per se: constraints due to perception, memory, or attention would
also suﬃce. To choose a trivial example, no human categorizes objects according to
their color along the ultra-violet spectrum; this is a higher-order constraint that limits
which hypotheses about object categorization are considered, but it emerges because
our perceptual systems do not represent ultraviolet colors, not because of anything
cognitive or knowledge-based per se.
Of course, most of the time the natural response to these learnability problems
is to hypothesize higher-order constraints that are both innate and (often) domain-
speciﬁc. For instance, core systems of object representation (e.g., Carey & Spelke,
1996; Spelke & Kinzler, 2007) are theorized to explain why infants assume that objects
obey spatio-temporal principles of cohesion, continuity, and contact (Spelke, 1990;
Aguiar & Baillargeon, 1999). Core knowledge of psychology is used to explain why
babies believe that agents are distinct from objects in that they can move without
contact (Spelke, Phillips, & Woodward, 1995) and act in certain ways in response
to goals (Woodward, 1999; Gergely & Csibra, 2003).
Higher-level constraints on
grammatical generalizations may be one aspect of, or play the role of, Universal
Grammar (Chomsky, 1965). Constraints may also be learning algorithms, as in the
Subset Principle (Berwick, 1985), or innate conceptual machinery, as in the case of
Pinker’s semantic bootstrapping hypothesis for verb learning (Pinker, 1989).
In the next section I will address three particular areas in language acquisition
and cognitive development, corresponding to Chapters 3, 4, and 5 respectively, where
we see these learnability problems play out in diﬀerent ways.
25

Learnability in acquisition and development
Auxiliary fronting: Learning abstract syntactic principles
One learnability problem that has been much debated in cognitive science and lin-
guistics concerns the phenomenon of auxiliary fronting in constructing English in-
terrogative sentences (Laurence & Margolis, 2001; Lewis & Elman, 2001; Legate &
Yang, 2002; Pullum & Scholz, 2002; Reali & Christiansen, 2005). This is an exam-
ple of a PoS problem that results from the lack of a certain kind of positive data,
namely, complex polar interrogatives. I consider this speciﬁc example with two larger
goals in mind: to begin an exploration of the logical structure of poverty of stimulus
arguments; and to address the general phenomenon of hierarchical phrase structure
in syntax more speciﬁcally – the phenomenon that has been argued to underlie the
learning of auxiliary fronting and many other speciﬁc rules.
At the core of modern linguistics is the insight that sentences, although they might
appear to be simply linear sequences of words or sounds, are built up in a hierarchical
fashion from nested phrase structures (Chomsky, 1965, 1980). The rules of syntax
are deﬁned over linguistic elements corresponding to phrases that can be represented
hierarchically with respect to one another: for instance, a noun phrase might itself
contain a prepositional phrase. By contrast, in a language without hierarchical phrase
structure the rules of syntax might make reference only to the individual elements
of the sentence as they appear in a linear sequence. Henceforth, when I say that
“language has hierarchical phrase structure” I mean, more precisely, that the rules
of syntax are deﬁned over hierarchical phrase-structure representations rather than a
linear sequence of words. Is the knowledge that language is organized in this way in-
nate? In other words, is it a part of the initial state of the language acquisition system
and a necessary feature of any possible hypothesis that the learner will consider?
Chomsky (1965, 1971, 1980) put forth several arguments for this position, most
famously one based on the phenomenon of auxiliary fronting in English.
English
interrogatives such as “Is the man hungry?” correspond to declaratives with a fronted
main clause auxiliary like “The man is hungry”: the auxiliary is at the beginning of
26

the interrogative appears to map to the is in the middle of the declarative. One might
consider two possible rules that could govern this correspondence between declarative
and interrogative forms:
1.3. (a) Linear: Form the interrogative by moving the ﬁrst occurrence of the auxiliary
in the declarative to the beginning of the sentence.
(b) Hierarchical: Form the interrogative by moving the auxiliary from the main
clause of the declarative to the beginning of the sentence.
The linear rule 1.3(a) can be implemented without reference to the hierarchical
phrase structure of the sentence, but the hierarchical rule 1.3(b) cannot. We know
that the actual grammar of English follows principles much closer to the hierarchical
rule 1.3(b), but how is a child to learn that such a rule is correct as opposed to a
linear rule such as 1.3(a)? Although the linear and hierarchical rules result in the
same outcome when applied to simple declarative sentences like “The man is hungry”,
they yield diﬀerent results when applied to more complex declaratives such as this:
1.4. The man who is hungry is ordering dinner.
The linear rule predicts the interrogative form in (1.5.a), while the hierarchical
rule predicts the form in (1.5.b):
1.5. (a) * Is the man who hungry is ordering dinner?
(b) Is the man who is hungry ordering dinner?
Of course, 1.5(b) is grammatical in English while 1.5(a) is not. This diﬀerence
could provide a basis for inferring the correct rule: if children learning language hear
a suﬃcient sample of grammatical sentences like 1.5(b) and few or no ungrammatical
sentences like 1.5(a), they might reasonably infer that the hierarchical rule rather than
the linear rule correctly describes the grammar of English. Yet Chomsky argued that
complex interrogative sentences such as 1.5(b) do not exist in suﬃcient quantity in
child-directed speech, going so far as to assert that “it is quite possible for a person to
go through life without having heard any of the relevant examples that would choose
27

between the two principles” (1971). In spite of this paucity of evidence, children
three to ﬁve years old can form correct complex interrogative sentences like 1.5(b)
but appear not to produce incorrect forms such as 1.5(a) (Crain & Nakayama, 1987).
Chomsky further argued that on a priori grounds, a general-purpose learning
agent who knows nothing speciﬁcally about human natural languages would take the
linear rule to be more plausible by virtue of its simplicity: it does not assume either
the existence of hidden objects (e.g., syntactic phrases) or of a particular organization
(e.g., hierarchical rather than linear). If the correct rule cannot be learned from data
and is also dispreferred due to a general inductive bias favoring simplicity, the logical
conclusion is that children come equipped with some powerful language-speciﬁc innate
mechanisms that bias them to learn syntactic rules deﬁned over hierarchical rather
than linear structures.4
Word learning: The problem of reference
The issue of determining the referent of a word is one of the prototypical learnability
problems confronting children as they develop. As in other domains, most theories
of how to overcome this problem hypothesize some sort of innate overhypothesis
or higher-order constraint.
For instance, the whole object constraint is theorized
to describe why children prefer to apply words to whole objects rather than parts
(Heibeck & Markman, 1987; Markman, 1990). Other constraints include the mutual
exclusivity principle, which suggests that children assume that objects have only one
label, and the taxonomic assumption, under which children assume that labels pick
out objects organized by kind rather than thematically (Markman, 1990).
These and other overhypotheses seem reasonable, and there is considerable evi-
dence in favor of them, but it is also clear that they cannot be the whole story. After
4In his formulation, Chomsky was concerned with the question of structure dependence (whether
the syntactic rules were deﬁned over the structures of the language) rather than the question of
what those structures were (i.e., hierarchical or linear). The analysis here is not an attempt to argue
against the innateness of structure dependence per se, which inherently depends on the notion of
movement rules. I do not evaluate linguistic representations that incorporate any such rules, and
therefore am focused here more on the second question, (although the two are clearly quite closely
intertwined, and the general framework might be interestingly applied to that question).
28

all, we do learn the names of parts of objects eventually (presumably one does not
need to see a detached arm or head in order to acquire those terms!). Some of the
words children learn violate the mutual exclusivity assumption: a child’s pet may be
both an animal and a dog (and, for that matter, a pet). While one could respond
to these objections by modifying the constraints to be soft and allow exceptions,
precisely specifying which exceptions to allow, and when, is nontrivial indeed.
There is deeper problem with the idea that the problem of reference is solved by
assuming the existence of innate overhypotheses about word learning: namely, that
at least some overhypotheses appear to be learned. For instance, consider the shape
bias: by the age of 24 months old, English-learning children tend to assume that
count nouns are organized by shape. When given a novel object paired with a novel
label like “dax”, they are likely to generalize it to items that are similar in shape
but not texture or color (Landau, Smith, & Jones, 1988; Soja, Carey, & Spelke,
1991).
There are many compelling reasons for believing that this bias is learned
rather than innate. The distribution of count nouns in English is organized by shape,
and children do not acquire the shape bias until their vocabulary reaches a certain
size (Samuelson & Smith, 1999, 2000). Teaching them additional words before that
point makes them not only acquire the bias earlier, but also results in faster learning
of other, non-taught words (Smith, Jones, Landau, Gershkoﬀ-Stowe, & Samuelson,
2002). Furthermore, the shape bias does not appear to be the only overhypothesis
about feature generalization that children apply to word learning: while shape alone
is a good cue to category membership for artifacts, texture seems as good as shape
for animal categories, and color rather than shape appears most appropriate for foods
(e.g., Booth & Waxman, 2002; Macario, 1991).
Some have suggested that the shape bias is a matter of attentional learning, and
emerges simply from noting the distributional overlap between count nouns and their
referents (Smith, Jones, Yoshida, & Colunga, 2003; Colunga & Smith, 2004, 2005;
Smith & Samuelson, 2005). Under this view, words are simply features that hap-
pen to correlate strongly with shape, and children learn this correlation based on
simple association. Another explanation holds that word labels are a cue to kind or
29

category membership, and shape is useful because it is also a reliable cue (Soja et
al., 1991; Xu, Carey, & Quint, 2004). Under this explanation, the shape bias is not
linguistic per se: rather, it emerges from the ontological commitments children make
concerning the nature of kinds (Xu, 2002; Xu et al., 2004; Bloom, 2000; Markson,
Diesendruck, & Bloom, 2008). Thus, although this latter account certainly argues for
more innate machinery, what is assumed innate is not the shape bias (or any partic-
ular feature bias) itself, but rather the assumptions the child brings to the problem
of word learning that result in the shape bias.5
Another way to characterize this debate, therefore, might be that the two sides
disagree about the nature of the over-overhypotheses that govern the acquisition of the
shape bias – or, put another way, they diﬀer on the nature of the innate knowledge that
guides the acquisition of the higher-level constraints T.6 One side states this explicitly,
arguing that the contention under debate concerns what assumptions children make
about how labels and shapes pick out kinds. But even the distributional account,
though it claims that no strong or domain-speciﬁc assumptions are necessary, limits
the features considered; they include shape and some others (size, color, texture), but
not an inﬁnite number, and the account is largely about how a learner determines
which of those features is relevant. Everyone has implicitly accepted that something
that is itself an overhypothesis (i.e., the shape bias) can be learned; they just disagree
about what assumptions are necessary to explain how.
However, there is a hint of a paradox at the center of the notion of learned in-
ductive constraints that we need to confront: how can an overhypothesis be learned
before the things it is constraining and still act to constrain them? Does lower-level
learning always occur before higher-level learning, as one might expect, or is it pos-
5While many of these researchers suggest that shape for young children is salient and important
even in the absence of word learning, this is not due to some sort of (innate) general perceptual
salience applied indiscriminately; rather, it is salient precisely when children have reason to believe
it is a valid cue for kind categories (e.g.,
S. Gelman & Ebeling, 1998; Bloom & Markson, 1998;
Diesendruck & Bloom, 2003).
Indeed, although these researchers have not proposed a learning
mechanism for how children realize that shape is a cue for category membership, they seem broadly
sympathetic to the idea that one exists (e.g., Soja et al., 1991; Markson et al., 2008).
6Although, as we shall see in Chapter 4, these are not over-overhypotheses that are cached out
directly in the model we present. I use the notion here of over-overhypothesis in a more general
sense, as a constraint on a constraint that is itself learned.

sible to acquire an overhypothesis faster than the speciﬁc hypotheses it is meant to
constrain? If not, how can we explain the shape bias? If so, what principles ex-
plain this acquisition? And what, if anything, does this imply about the inductive
constraints that were previously assumed must be innate?
Baker’s Paradox: The case of verb argument constructions
Another classic learnability problem in language acquisition concerns the generaliza-
tion patterns of verb argument constructions (Baker, 1979; Bowerman, 1988; Pinker,
1989). Verbs vary syntactically as well as semantically: diﬀerent verbs take arguments
in distinct patterns, or constructions. For instance, a verb like love is associated with
the transitive construction, which requires the verb to take an NP object (e.g., “He
loves her”). Diﬀerent verbs are associated with diﬀerent constructions, and often
cluster in recognizable patterns. Consider the following English sentence pairs:
1.6. (a) Dave gave a gift to Laura. / Dave gave Laura a gift.
(b) Tracy sent an e-mail to Rob. / Tracy sent Rob an e-mail.
(c) Steve told a joke to Lauren. / Steve told Lauren a joke.
(d) Julie read a book to John. / Julie read John a book.
You might expect, based on these, that an acceptable generalization would be to
say that anything that can occur in the ﬁrst construction (the prepositional dative)
is also found in the second (double-object dative). Unfortunately, some verbs occur
in one construction only:
1.7. (a) Toby reported the loss to Sara. / * Toby reported Sara the loss.
(b) Diane said “okay” to George. / * Diane said George “okay.”
This is a classic example of the No Negative Evidence problem: though children
are never told that the starred sentences are incorrect, they eventually learn to avoid
them. This particular pair of constructions, called the dative alternation, is just one
example; three other common alternations, extensively discussed by Pinker (1989)
and elaborated in Levin (1993), among others, are:
31

1.8. Passive alternation
(a) Ben kicked Stephanie. / Stephanie was kicked by Ben.
(b) Ben resembled Stephanie. / *Stephanie was resembled by Ben.
1.9. Causative alternation
(a) The box opened. / Melissa opened the box.
(b) The dog barked. / * Melissa barked the dog.
1.10. Locative alternation
(a) Kelly loaded hay into the truck. / Kelly loaded the truck with hay.
(b) Kelly pushed hay into the truck. / * Kelly pushed the truck with hay.
Baker (1979), one of the ﬁrst to point out this problem, claimed that children
never produce the incorrect constructions: “the speech of children contains virtually
no examples in which they overgeneralize the double-NP construction to verbs that
do not allow it in the adult language.” (p 543) More recent evidence indicates that
Baker’s claim is untrue – there is a stage at which children do overgeneralize7 – but
this simply makes their behavior more diﬃcult to explain. If children make certain
predictable errors due to overgeneralization, they are probably not relying on the
Subset Principle; so how are they ultimately solving this learnability problem? What
higher-order constraints T must we assume in order to explain their behavior?
Bringing it all together
Each of these three learnability problems is centrally concerned with the issues that
arise when faced with an underconstrained problem of induction. The Feature Rele-
vance problem focuses on the question of how a learner decides which of a potentially
inﬁnite number of features to generalize upon. The No Negative Evidence problem is
about how to correctly limit generalizations along the feature(s) already identiﬁed as
7See Pinker (1989) and Chapter 5 for an overview.
32

relevant, if one lacks negative evidence about which ones are incorrect. And the most
general of the three, the Poverty of the Stimulus problem, is about how to general-
ize when one lacks the evidence (of whatever kind) believed necessary to distinguish
between multiple hypotheses that are otherwise all consistent with the data.
Existing learnability analyses have proven valuable for not only pointing out these
problems in the ﬁrst place, but also for providing a starting point in the struggle
to understand how human learners solve them; but, as with any single approach,
they have certain limitations. In this thesis I exploit recent advances in machine
learning and computer science to revisit these arguments from a novel perspective.
Although each speciﬁc learnability problem poses its own challenges, and all diﬀer
in particular details, several common themes – the core insights contributed by the
Bayesian approach – emerge throughout.
Ideal analysis, but with real-world datasets
The three learnability problems I have discussed involve datasets with certain char-
acteristics. The mathematical investigations of learnability in the limit apply only
for datasets that are inﬁnite in size. For the logical problem of induction presented
by Goodman, the concern arises from the ﬁnite size of the dataset rather than any of
the other characteristics it might have. And the Poverty of the Stimulus argument
makes reference not to an entire dataset of language, but only to those certain subsets
assumed to be relevant.
In none of these cases are large, real-world datasets incorporated into the analy-
ses. In one sense this is a strength – it is genuinely useful to be able to identify what
can happen in the limit of inﬁnite data – but at the same time, it forms only part of
the picture. Learnability analyses can be ideal either because the learner is ideal, or
because the data is. This means that the space of diﬀerent kinds of learnability anal-
yses encompasses four options, graphically depicted in Figure 1-1. Most learnability
analyses to date, as we’ve seen, have applied only to the top square: evaluating the
eﬀects of having ideal data as well as an ideal learner. The ultimate goal of cognitive
science and linguistics is to understand the bottom square: how realistic learners use
33

Figure 1-1: The landscape of learnability analyses. Learnability approaches diﬀer
based on the assumptions made about both the data and the learner. Most learn-
ability analyses to date have applied only to the top square: ideal learners given ideal
data. Ultimately we would like to be able to understand the bottom square: what
realistic learners glean from realistic data. With this ultimate goal in mind, this thesis
considers the shaded square on the right: ideal learners given realistic data.
realistic data over their lifetime. This thesis considers the shaded square on the right,
exploring what is possible to learn in theory – i.e., given an ideal learner – based on
the type of data that children actually see.
An advantage of this approach, besides moving the dialogue towards the ultimate
goal, is that reframes the dialogue; instead of noting all of the many ways that
learning is impossible in theory, it asks what can be learned in practice. Thanks to
the analyses of mathematical learning theory, we know that it is impossible to learn
non-ﬁnite languages in the limit without making certain strong assumptions about
the presentation of the data, and that even viewing the problem probabilistically
only helps if you know the general shape of the family of distributions to begin with.
But these analyses apply to classes of languages deﬁned according to the Chomsky
hierarchy, not individual ones. Even if an ideal learner is not guaranteed to converge
to the correct grammar on an arbitrary dataset, it might actually converge – or at
least learn something linguistically interesting – on a dataset of real linguistic input.
Natural language, particularly of the sort that children receive, is very diﬀerent than
an ideal corpus, containing a small number of sentence types that are idiosyncratically
distributed in many ways. This is certainly a diﬀerent sort of learning problem, and
it is useful to explore precisely what assumptions need to be made to solve it.
Exploring full real-world datasets is important even in counterpoint to the anal-
34

yses that have either assumed that the dataset is minimal (but ﬁnite), or that have
concentrated on only a particular subset of linguistic input. Goodman’s riddle of
induction points out that some constraints are necessary, leaving scientists with the
question of “which ones?” Identifying those constraints – particularly if they exist on
an even higher level, like over-overhypotheses – is much facilitated by being able to
explore what an ideal learner can learn from real-world data. PoS arguments whose
core contention concerns the lack of some piece of data are better evaluated in the
context of a real-world dataset: this helps to avoid making implicit assumptions about
which data is actually relevant to the learning problem.
Higher-order constraints can be learned
Although the idea that higher-order inductive constraints T can be learned is explored
most fully in the context of the shape bias, it is a theme that runs through all of the
analyses in this thesis. The importance of this idea is apparent in two major ways.
First, it forces a re-examination of the usual presumption in cognitive science that
ﬁnding evidence for the existence of an inductive constraint means that the constraint
itself must be innate. If inductive constraints can be learned – and sometimes learned
faster than the speciﬁc hypotheses they are constraining – then it may be possible
that many of the constraints and biases we assume to be built in are actually not.
Under this view something must be innate, to be sure; but we may not be justiﬁed in
concluding that any particular constraint is, even if it emerges early in development.
More broadly, realizing how levels of knowledge can mutually reinforce and interact
with one another as they are acquired can yield insight into what must be presumed
in the ﬁrst place.
Secondly, and perhaps more beneﬁcially, this work demonstrates a paradigm for
addressing the questions the ﬁrst point opens up. Without a means to explore whether
a hypothesized inductive constraint is truly innate, or is learned based on some even
higher-level innate assumptions, the only beneﬁt from this sort of re-examination
would be, perhaps, to help restrain ourselves from jumping to conclusions. However,
the Bayesian framework oﬀers a means for performing that exploration by providing
35

a way to rigorously and systematically evaluate what sort of over-overhypotheses (or
even over-over-overhypotheses) would be necessary to qualitatively explain human
learning in the face of real-world data.
The simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt tradeoﬀ
A central question in understanding how people learn and reason about the world
relates to why we generalize beyond the input we receive at all – why not simply
memorize everything? Needing to generalize creates a logical problem when there
are an inﬁnite number of possible features along which that generalization could be
formed. Nevertheless, we must generalize because the ability to make inferences and
predict data we haven’t previously observed relies on our ability to extract structure
from our observations of the world. If we do not generalize, we cannot learn, even
though any act of generalization is, by deﬁnition, a simpliﬁcation of the data in the
world, resulting in occasional error. It is therefore important to simplify the data in
such a way as to ﬁnd the optimal balance between the gain in generalization and the
cost due to error.
Achieving this balance is one of the fundamental goals of any learner, and indeed
of any scientiﬁc theory or computational/statistical framework. Too much emphasis
on simplicity means the learner is unable to learn from data, producing a high degree
of error; too much emphasis on precisely memorizing the data means that the learner
overﬁts, unable to capture the correct underlying generalizations. Bayesian models
capture the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt in an optimal way.8 Be-
cause human learners – including children – care primarily about predicting future
events, they too must adopt some version of this tradeoﬀ.
As a result of performing this tradeoﬀ, the amount and type of data can have a
profound eﬀect on the inferred theory. Especially when the representations involved
are richly structured, what look like discrete qualitative shifts emerge simply because
the tradeoﬀfavors diﬀerent theories as the data changes. In all three of the areas
examined in this thesis, we will see how shifts in behavior that qualitatively parallel

human learning are a natural byproduct of Bayesian learning on realistic data.
Goals of this thesis
The central goal of this thesis is to explore three common learnability arguments by
formalizing them in Bayesian terms; and, in so doing, to supply insight on several of
the fundamental questions in cognitive science and language acquisition. What do we
need to assume about a child’s innate endowment – about her representational capac-
ities, learning mechanisms, and cognitive biases – in order to explain the process and
outcome of language acquisition? By focusing on three classic learnability arguments
in the context of three major questions in language acquisition, I explore the issues
of representation and learnability from multiple angles and demonstrate some of the
power and ﬂexibility of the this paradigm.
Bayesian learning oﬀers a solution to the No Negative Evidence problem, resulting
from the simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt balance. And while it does not solve the Feature
Relevance or the Poverty of Stimulus problems in the abstract, it yields useful insights
about both: that higher-level abstract constraints may be learned at least as rapidly as
lower-level speciﬁc information; that evidence for certain types of abstract knowledge
may result from characteristics of an entire dataset rather than speciﬁc items; and
that what knowledge or constraints are innate may be speciﬁable at an abstract
enough level that they could plausibly be domain-general even if the less abstract
knowledge is not.
This research oﬀers a new perspective about what we can and can’t conclude
from standard learnability arguments, and provides a framework that allows for an
increasingly subtle, detailed, and rigorous analysis of claims about what must or must
not be innate (as well as what that even means). The framework allows us to evaluate
the bounds of “optimal” reasoning while also being able to vary with precision how
this might depend on the data, the nature of the learner’s mental representation, and
both domain-speciﬁc as well as domain-general biases (whether due to the attentional,
perceptual, memory-based, or learning mechanisms of the child). By no means do
37

I argue that such a framework should supplant other methods in cognitive science,
but it is an essential tool in the toolbox as we move toward constructing a full and
accurate picture of the human mind.
In the next chapter I provide a basic introduction to the Bayesian framework,
including a discussion of some of the implications and issues that arise for anybody
working within it. The subsequent three chapters each focus on the three particular
areas in language acquisition and cognitive development introduced in here, which we
can broadly classify by topic: abstract syntactic structure, verb argument structure,
and word learning. Although similar themes emerge in each of these areas, the division
by topic helps us explore the power and ﬂexibility of the framework as I apply it to
a range of problems, over several types of representation, and with multiple kinds
of data. In the ﬁnal chapter I discuss this work on a broader level, with a special
focus on the themes underlying all of the individual projects, a consideration of the
framework, and the direction of research as we move forward.
38

Chapter 2
An introduction to Bayesian
modelling
Generalization is a central issue in cognitive science and language acquisition: how do
we learn so much from such apparently limited evidence? This question arises in any
situation in which the conclusions are underdetermined by the information available
and it is therefore necessary to make inductive leaps – precisely the sorts of situations
likely to be encountered by a human learner on a daily basis. Bayesian inference
is a general-purpose computational framework for understanding and exploring how
people might make these inductive leaps.
This chapter provides a basic introduction to how the Bayesian framework can be
applied to important questions in cognitive science. The goal is to provide an intuitive
and accessible guide to the what and the why of the Bayesian approach: what sorts of
problems and data the framework is most relevant for, and how and why it may be
useful for psychologists and cognitive scientists. I spend some time considering issues
that are particularly relevant for any cognitive scientist in evaluating a computational
model, including its biological plausibility, application to developmental issues, and
the question of what these sorts of models can reveal about the human mind. This will
be useful in subsequent chapters as we analyze particular models and ask questions
about why they act as they do, and what conclusions we can draw about important
issues in cognitive science on the basis of their behavior.
39

The basics
The fundamental question a Bayesian approach addresses is how to update beliefs and
make new inferences in light of new data. Central to this framework is the assumption
that beliefs can be represented as probabilities – that one’s degree of belief in some
proposition, hypothesis, or theory X can be expressed as a real number ranging
from 0 to 1, where 0 means “X is completely false” and 1 means “X is completely
true.” Making such an assumption allows us to use the mathematics of probability
theory to conduct inference: how to select from among a set of theories which one(s)
best explain the observed data. The Bayesian framework does so by formalizing an
important tradeoﬀbetween the complexity of the theory on one hand and how well
it explains the observed data on the other; it prefers theories that oﬀer a balance
between the two.
Observed data is assumed to be generated by some underlying process – a mecha-
nism explaining why the data occurs in the patterns it does. (Spoken sentences may
be generated from some sort of mental grammar; words are generated from a mental
lexicon; and both are partially aﬀected by social and pragmatic factors as well). The
job of the learner is to evaluate diﬀerent hypotheses about the underlying nature of
that process, and to make predictions based on the most likely hypotheses.
This is perhaps best illustrated in the context of a schematic example, depicted
graphically in Figure 2-1. Data (the dots) are generated by processes that occupy
diﬀerent subsets of space: each process can generate data within its region, but
not data outside of it. Each hypothesis constitutes a diﬀerent theory about which
subset(s) of space the processes occupy. One such hypothesis is illustrated in Figure
1: according to this hypothesis, there are two underlying processes, each denoted
by one of the blue rectangles. If a learner believes that this hypothesis was correct,
she might predict that she would be far more likely to observe a new datapoint in
position a rather than position b, even if she had previously seen neither. In such
a way, learning which hypotheses are most likely can aid a learner in inference and
generalization.
40

Figure 2-1: Example data and hypothesis. Graphical representation of data and one
possible hypothesis about the how that data was generated. This hypothesis suggests
that there are two generative processes, each depicted as a blue rectangle. Under this
hypothesis, a new datapoint in position a is far more likely than one in b.
Hypotheses are compared using Bayes’ Rule (Equation 2.1, below), which states
that the probability of some hypothesis given the data (the posterior) is proportional
to the probability of the data given the hypothesis (the likelihood) and the probability
that the hypothesis is true, regardless of what the data is (the prior).
p(H|D) ∝p(D|H)p(H).
(2.1)
Intuitively, the posterior probability captures a natural balance between simplicity
(measured by the prior) and goodness-of-ﬁt (measured by the likelihood). Achieving
this balance is one of the fundamental goals of any computational framework, and
indeed of any scientiﬁc theory: too much emphasis on simplicity means the theory or
model is unable to learn from data, and too much emphasis on goodness-of-ﬁt means
that it overﬁts, unable to capture the true generalizations within the data. Figure 2-2
illustrates this graphically: channeling Goldilocks, we might conclude that hypothesis
A looks too simple, hypothesis C seems too complex, and hypothesis B is “just right.”
(Or, following Einstein, “everything should be made as simple as possible, but not
simpler.”) Bayesian models capture this intuition using techniques sometimes known
as the Bayesian Occam’s Razor (MacKay, 2004).
How well a hypothesis ﬁts the data is captured by the likelihood, given by P(H|D):
the probability of the observed data given the hypothesis. Although the likelihood
can sometimes be diﬃcult to calculate in practice, it is straightforward to understand
41

Figure 2-2: The Goldilocks Eﬀect. Hypothesis A is too simple, C is too complex, and
B is “just right.” Hypothesis A is quite simple, but ﬁts the observed data poorly:
C ﬁts closely but is highly complicated. The best description of the data should
optimize a tradeoﬀbetween complexity and ﬁt, as in B.
intuitively. For instance, hypothesis C in Figure 2-2 clearly has a high likelihood:
if the hypothesis is true – that is, if the data is truly generated by thirty distinct
underlying processes corresponding to the thirty rectangles of C – the datapoints
could hardly be anywhere else. Hypothesis C therefore ﬁts the data extremely well.
By contrast, hypothesis A has relatively low likelihood: it does not explain why the
datapoints are found where they are. After all, according to A, the thirty datapoints
would be just as likely if they were each randomly located in other places within the
blue rectangle. The ratio of the observed datapoints to the area for predicted data
is low for A, since the data could easily have been elsewhere, but high for C, since
it couldn’t. Likelihood is, essentially, this ratio1; thus, hypotheses that make speciﬁc
predictions – those with more explanatory power – are favored there.
The prior probability of a hypothesis, or P(H), is calculated in such a way that
simpler hypotheses have higher probability.
The deﬁnition of simplicity and the
corresponding calculation of P(H) are not the result of some externally-imposed ad
hoc mechanism.
Rather, they emerge naturally from the generative assumptions
1This is, incidentally, why it can be sometimes be diﬃcult to calculate. In the example here,
area is a straightforward calculation, but if the space of hypotheses is itself quite complicated, then
calculating the “area” of that space involves summing up all of the data that can be generated by the
hypothesis. This can be done by enumeration, but this is very time-consuming, and only practical
for simple problems. In general, mathematical techniques are used instead; one of the biggest areas
of research in machine learning is to develop more eﬀective techniques and faster, more eﬃcient
algorithms for using them. Gilks, Richardson, and Spiegelhalter (1996), MacKay (2004), and A.
Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin (2004) are good references for those interested in this issue.
42

underlying the Bayesian framework, in which hypotheses are themselves generated
from a space of candidate hypotheses. For instance, the hypotheses in Figure 2-2
correspond to diﬀerent sets of rectangular regions within the metric space. Simpler
hypotheses require fewer “choice points” during that generation process. Hypothesis
A can be fully captured by making only four choices: two for the coordinates of the
lower left-hand corner of the rectangle (x and y), one for its length (l), and one for
its width (w). By contrast, hypothesis C contains thirty distinct rectangular regions,
and therefore requires 120 separate choices to specify, four for each region.
This notion of calculating complexity as a function of the number of choice points
is a reﬂection of the idea that the more complicated something is, the more likely it is
to mess it up – or, in other words, “The more they overtech the plumbing, the easier
it is to stop up the drain.”2 I discovered this principle in junior high school when I
tried to make a double-layer cake for a bake sale, never before having tried baking
anything. Several explosions of ﬂour, an unanticipated smoke alarm, and a burnt,
unrisen cake later, I concluded that perhaps it would have been a better idea to start
my cooking career with grilled cheese sandwiches or scrambled eggs instead. More
complicated recipes have more ingredients and more directions, which means they
have more choice points – more opportunities for things to go wrong. In a similar
way, the more choices a hypothesis requires, the more likely it is that those choices
could have been made in a diﬀerent way, resulting in an entirely diﬀerent hypothesis.
The precise prior probability of a hypotheses is therefore not arbitrarily assigned,
but rather falls out in a principled way from how the hypotheses are generated. My
“generative model” for cake recipes – in a sad reﬂection of my cooking knowledge at
the time – was close to assuming that recipes consist of ingredients randomly thrown
together; the generative model for the hypotheses in Figure 2-2 is one that can result
in any possible combination of rectangular regions within the metric space. A diﬀerent
generative model results in a diﬀerent – but no less principled – assignment of prior
probabilities. For instance, if we assumed the regions could be circles rather than
rectangles, then each region would require three choice points rather than four (the
2Scotty, Star Trek IV.
43

x and y coordinates of the center of the circle, plus its radius). Despite the diﬀerent
generative model, the logic favoring simple hypotheses is the same: multiple regions
will still be a priori less likely than a few.3 The generative model therefore matters
for determining precisely what the relative probability of each hypothesis is, but
most reasonable models give qualitatively similar relative probabilities to qualitatively
similar hypotheses.
The set of all possible hypotheses is called the hypothesis space, which is depicted
graphically in Figure 2-3. It can also be thought of as the range of hypotheses the
model can entertain – the space of possibilities inherent in the setup. In the cooking
example, the hypothesis space would be the space of all recipes I could have made
given the ingredients in the house at the time – the number of random combinations
of those ingredients and ways of cooking them. (Note that hypothesis spaces can
be inﬁnite in size). The hypothesis space corresponding to Figure 2-2 consists of
all possible combinations of rectangles. Hypothesis spaces can also be additive or
disjunctive: for instance, if we weren’t sure about the shape of the regions generating
the data, we could consider the hypothesis space made up of all possible rectangles
and all possible circles. (If that were the case, prior probability would be assigned
under a generative model that had an additional choice point for each region: is it a
rectangle or a circle? Each individual hypothesis would therefore have a lower prior
probability, although the probability of each relative to the other would be the same).
Learning and inference within a Bayesian model involves comparing the diﬀerent
3It is always true that within the set of choices deﬁned by the generative model, the hypothesis
that requires fewer choices has higher probability. However, it is always possible, by changing the
primitives of the model, to design some Bizarro World model that looks to us as though it assigns
higher probability to more complicated-looking hypotheses. For instance, so far we have considered
“primitives” – the basic elements we have to make choices about – to be simple regions like rectangles
and circles. We could imagine instead that each primitive was deﬁned within the model as, say, a set
of thirty tiny regions (of which hypothesis C might be one instance); other hypotheses might be made
by adding to or subtracting from those. In that case, hypothesis C might very well have higher prior
probability than A. In this sense, then, the simplicity of a hypothesis is only meaningful relative to
the set of primitives out of which the hypotheses are generated – and prior probability is, therefore,
only a principled calculation given to those. The decision of what the primitives are is therefore an
important choice that must be made by any modeler, and is an issue I consider in more depth later.
For now, I will just note that this is a decision that is not restricted to Bayesian modelers, but must
in fact be faced by any theorist, computational or otherwise: indeed, the Bayesian framework – by
forcing us to make these assumptions explicit – can be a powerful tool for evaluating the primitives
we choose.

possible hypothesis; some are supported closely by the data and some are not. The
actual hypothesis space contains all possible rectangles, but I show just a few for
illustrative purposes.
hypotheses in the hypothesis space, ultimately preferring those with the highest pos-
terior probability. In the example above, the model learns which of the possible sets
of regions constitutes the best theory about the underlying data-generating process.
The hypothesis space itself is given: the theory must consist of a set of regions that
exist within the positive quadrant of coordinate space, and the regions are speciﬁed
by x, y, l, and w values within some range. This type of information must be built
into any model, but these speciﬁcations need not be very strong or very limiting: for
instance, one might simply specify that the range of possible values for x, y, l, and w
lies between 0 and some extremely large number like 109, or be drawn from a prob-
ability distribution with a very long tail. The issue of what is “built in” will recur
throughout this chapter, and I will return to it more broadly later in the chapter.
Hierarchical learning
One way to eﬀectively increase the size of the hypothesis space is to allow learning
at multiple levels of abstraction – learning higher-order information about speciﬁc
hypotheses as well as the hypotheses themselves. We see this type of learning all the
time in human cognition. Learning to cook involves realizing that making breads and
pastries generally requires mixing ingredients that often include eggs and ﬂour; that
meat is often either fried or cooked in a pan, but not usually inserted into the toaster;
and that spices and seasonings should be used by the pinch, not by the jar. These

(b)
Figure 2-4: Learning higher-order information. (a) Given point a, one cannot identify
whether b or c is more likely. (b) Given additional data, a model that could learn
higher-order information about hypotheses might realize that regions tend to be long,
thin rectangles oriented along the y axis. If so, points a and b are probably within
the same region, but a and c are not.
realizations are all inferences about the nature of recipes rather than speciﬁc recipes
themselves, and are especially useful when confronted with a novel yet underspeciﬁed
recipe or a new set of ingredients. Even if you have never made roast goose before,
you know that you shouldn’t try to cook it by grinding it up and mixing it with eggs
and ﬂour – there is no need to ruin Christmas dinner to ﬁnd this out.
A similar type of inference would occur if, presented with the data in Figure 2-4,
a learner realized not only which rectangular regions were most likely, but also that
the regions tend to long, thin, and oriented along the y-axis. Just as making higher-
order inferences about cooking helps when confronted with a new situation, making
this type of higher-order inference helps the learner when confronted with novel data.
Such a learner would be able to infer that point b is probably in the same region as
a but point c is not, even though b and c are equidistant from a.
A certain kind of Bayesian model, known as a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM),
can capture this sort of inference. It learns not only by choosing among speciﬁc hy-
potheses, but by also making higher-order generalizations about those hypotheses. In
a non-hierarchical Bayesian model, the modeler sets the parameters that govern the
hypotheses, as we’ve seen. In a hierarchical model, the modeler speciﬁes the hyper-
parameters – parameters on the parameters – and the model learns the parameters
46

themselves. So rather being given that the range of each of the x, y, l, and w values
lies between 0 and 109, the hierarchical model learns the typical range of each – e.g.,
that l tends to be short while w tends to be long – and the modeler speciﬁes the
range of the ranges.
A surprising eﬀect of learning in hierarchical models is that, quite often, the higher-
order abstractions are acquired before the speciﬁc lower-level details: the model might
realize that l tends to be short and w tends to be long before it has speciﬁed the size
and location of each rectangular region with precision. This eﬀect, which we might call
the “blessing of abstraction”4, is somewhat counterintuitive. Why are higher-order
generalizations like this sometimes easier for a Bayesian learner to acquire?
One reason is that the higher-level hypothesis space is often smaller than the
lower-level one. As a result, the model has to choose between fewer options at the
higher level, which may require less evidence. For instance, the higher-level knowledge
may consist of only three options: l and w are approximately equal, l is smaller than
w, or w is smaller than l. Even if a learner doesn’t know whether l is 10 units or 11
units long and w is 20 or 22, it might be fairly obvious that l is smaller than w.
More generally, the higher-level inference concerns the lower-level hypothesis space
(and hence the dataset as a whole), whereas the lower-level inference is only relevant
for speciﬁc datapoints. The red datapoint in Figure 2-4 is informative only about
the precise size and location of a single region, the rectangle on the left. However,
it – and every other single datapoint – is informative about all of the higher-level
hypotheses. There is, in eﬀect, more evidence available to the higher levels than the
lower ones, and they are therefore learned more quickly.
This has interesting implications for the study of learnability and the question
of innateness. The basic motivation for positing innate constraints on cognitive de-
velopment is that without these constraints, children would be unable to infer the
speciﬁc knowledge that they seem to acquire from the limited data available to them.
What is critical to the argument is that some constraints are present prior to learning
some of the speciﬁc data, not that those constraints must be innate. Approaches to
4I owe this coinage to Noah Goodman.

cognitive development that emphasize learning from data typically view the course
of development as a progressive layering of increasingly abstract knowledge on top of
more concrete representations; under such a view, learned abstract knowledge would
tend to come in after more speciﬁc concrete knowledge is learned, so the former could
not usefully constrain the latter. This view is sensible in the absence of learning mech-
anisms that can explain how abstract constraints could be learned together with (or
before) the more speciﬁc knowledge they are needed to constrain. However, hierarchi-
cal Bayesian models provide such a learning mechanism. If an abstract generalization
can be acquired very early and can function as a constraint on later acquisition of
speciﬁc data, it may function eﬀectively as if it were an innate domain-speciﬁc con-
straint, even if it is in fact not innate and instead is acquired by domain-general
induction from data.
Representational capacity
Because a Bayesian model can be deﬁned for any well-speciﬁed generative framework,
the representational capacity of the Bayesian approach is limited only by the repre-
sentations that can be speciﬁed by the generative process. In the example we’ve been
considering, the representation (rectangles in a metric space) is fairly simple, and
probabilistic inference is done over that representation. Other common representa-
tions include probability distributions in a metric space, which may be appropriate
for phonemes as Gaussian clusters in phonetic space (e.g., N. Feldman & Griﬃths,
2007); directed graphical causal models, which may be appropriate for causal reason-
ing (e.g., Pearl, 2000; Steyvers, Tenenbaum, Wagenmakers, & Blum, 2003; Gopnik et
al., 2004); abstract graphical structures including taxonomies, which may be appro-
priate for some aspects of conceptual structure (e.g., Kemp, Perfors, & Tenenbaum,
2004; Roy, Kemp, Mansinghka, & Tenenbaum, 2006; Schmidt, Kemp, & Tenenbaum,
2006; Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007); objects as vectors of features, which may be appropri-
ate for categorization and object understanding (e.g., Kemp, Tenenbaum, Griﬃths,
Yamada, & Ueda, 2006; Kemp, Perfors, & Tenenbaum, 2007; Shafto, Kemp, Mans-
48

inghka, Gordon, & Tenenbaum, 2006; Navarro & Griﬃths, 2007); bags of words,
which may be appropriate for semantic representation (e.g., Griﬃths, Steyvers, &
Tenenbaum, 2007); grammars, which may be appropriate for syntax (e.g., Dowman,
2000; Perfors, Tenenbaum, & Regier, 2006); argument structure frames, which may
be appropriate for verb knowledge (e.g., Alishahi & Stevenson, 2008); Markov models,
which may be appropriate for action planning and goal inference or part-of-speech
tagging (e.g., Verma & Rao, 2006; Baker, Tenenbaum, & Saxe, 2007; Goldwater &
Griﬃths, 2007); and even logical rules, which may be appropriate for some aspects
of conceptual knowledge (e.g., Goodman, Griﬃths, Feldman, & Tenenbaum, 2007).
This is not an exhaustive list, but it is suﬃcient to illustrate the representational
ﬂexibility inherent in the Bayesian approach.
The ability to capture a wide variety of both structured and unstructured repre-
sentations provides an escape from an intellectual dichotomy imposed in part by the
computational models available to theorists, especially those interested in questions
of learnability in language. Although the question of whether human learners have
(innate) domain-speciﬁc knowledge is logically separable from the question of whether
and to what extent that knowledge requires structured representations, in practice
these issues have often been conﬂated. Within cognitive science, computational mod-
els of how language might be learned have usually assumed that domain-general learn-
ing operates on representations without explicit structure (e.g., Elman et al., 1996;
Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986; Rogers et al., 2004; Reali & Christiansen, 2005).
The main proponents of innate language-speciﬁc factors, on the other hand, have
typically assumed that the representations involved are structured (e.g., Chomsky,
1965; Pinker, 1984). Few cognitive scientists have seriously explored the possibil-
ity that explicitly structured mental representations might be learned via domain-
general mechanisms. This lack exists in part because, historically, the computational
formalisms most widely perceived to be capable of capturing domain-general human
learning – neural networks and Markov models – incorporate representations without
explicit structure. While both of these frameworks have made substantial contribu-
tions to cognitive science, it is also important to be able to evaluate the possibility
49

that structured representations exist explicitly but can still be learned.
Bayesian
models provide a computational framework in which to ask this question.
Bayesian learning in action
Although each of these speciﬁc models have distinct properties depending on the
nature of the domain and dataset they are appropriate for, Bayesian learning in
general has a number of notable characteristics. One such feature, which emerges
naturally as a result of the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt, is that the
size of the dataset matters: diﬀerent hypotheses may be favored for diﬀerent amounts
of data, even if the data is always generated by the same underlying process. This is a
byproduct of sensible inference, and a hallmark of human cognition – I am more apt to
think that all pastry recipes share a common structure (eggs, ﬂour, baking in an oven)
if I have seen many diﬀerent recipes rather than only one. The Bayesian framework
oﬀers an explanation of why this kind of inference is reasonable, and provides a precise
account for how inference changes as the amount of data increases – in short, how
this sort of learning works, and why.
Let us return to Figure 2-2, but instead of comparing three diﬀerent hypotheses on
the same dataset, we can ask which hypotheses are preferred on datasets of diﬀerent
size. Figure 2-5 shows three datasets, all generated from the same underlying process,
but varying in the number of datapoints. The best hypothesis ﬁts the ﬁve datapoints
in dataset 1 quite poorly, but because there are so few points this does not impose
a substantial penalty relative to the high prior probability of the hypothesis. Thus,
smaller datasets are often marked by a greater degree of overgeneralization because
the dynamics of inference favor the simpler, more overgeneral hypotheses. As the
data accumulates, the penalty imposed for poor ﬁt is greater, since it applies to
each datapoint that is not predicted accurately by the hypothesis. Thus, the same
hypothesis that was dispreferred on the data in Figure 2-2 is actually most appropriate
for the largest dataset, which contains many points clustered into thirty tiny regions.
A potentially misleading implication of Figure 2-5 is that as the number of dat-
50

Figure 2-5: Role of dataset size. Three datasets with increasing numbers of datapoints
and their corresponding best hypotheses. For dataset 1, there are so few datapoints
that the simplicity of the hypothesis is the primary consideration; by dataset 3, the
preferred hypothesis is one that ﬁts the clustered datapoints quite tightly.
apoints increases, the most complex hypothesis will eventually always be preferred.
This is not true. Rather, the hypothesis that will be preferred is the one that com-
presses the data most optimally: in general, this will be the hypothesis that is closest
to the true generative process5 (MacKay, 2004). In other words, if the data is truly
generated by a process corresponding to thirty diﬀerent rectangular regions, then the
points will increasingly clump into clusters in those regions, and hypothesis C will
be preferred. But if the data is truly generated by a process inhabiting two larger
regions, then additional datapoints would look more like Figure 2-6 instead; in which
case, hypothesis B would still have a higher probability. In general, as data accu-
mulates a Bayesian learner will move towards increasingly complex hypotheses, but
stops as the current hypothesis approximates the true generative process.
This initial preference for a simple hypothesis, followed by the eventual adoption of
a more complex hypothesis, provides a natural solution to the No Negative Evidence
5Technically, this result has been proven for information-theoretic models in which probabilities
of data or hypotheses are replaced by the lengths (in bits) of messages that communicate them
to a receiver.
The result is known as the “MDL Principle” (Rissanen, 1978), and is related to
Kolmogorov complexity (Solomonoﬀ, 1964; Kolmogorov, 1965). The Bayesian version applies given
certain assumptions about the randomness of the data relative to the hypotheses and the hypotheses
relative to the prior (Vit`anyi & Li, 2000).
Both versions apply only to the hypotheses in the
hypothesis space: if no hypothesis corresponding to the true data generating process exists in the
space, then it will never be considered, much less ultimately preferred. Thus, the hypothesis that is
preferred by the model in the limit of inﬁnite data is the “best” hypothesis only in the sense that
it is closest to the true data generating process out of all of the hypotheses considered. This is a
somewhat simpliﬁed account of the mathematical results, since the relationship between Bayesian
inference and MDL-based approaches is complex; see Vit`anyi and Li (2000); Jaynes (2003); MacKay
(2004); Gr¨unwald, Myung, and Pitt (2005) for more details).

Figure 2-6: Interaction of dataset size and hypothesis choice. As data accumulates,
the best hypothesis approaches the true generative model.
Here, the hypothesis
consisting of two subsets of space is preferred over one with more, since the data is
distributed in such a way as to make the latter unlikely.
problem: deciding among hypotheses given positive-only examples. As the size of the
dataset approaches inﬁnity, a Bayesian learner rejects overgeneral hypotheses in favor
of more precise ones, as the subset principle would do. With limited amounts of data,
the Bayesian approach can make diﬀerent and more subtle predictions, as the graded
size-based likelihood trades oﬀagainst the preference for simplicity in the prior. The
likelihood in Bayesian learning can thus be seen as a principled quantitative measure
of the weight of implicit negative evidence – one that explains both how and when
overgeneralization should occur.
What will a Bayesian learner conclude after seeing just one datapoint? It may be
tempting to infer from the discussion so far that in that case, the simplest possible
hypothesis will be preferred; but this is not necessarily the case. It all depends on the
tradeoﬀin complexity that it takes to represent individual datapoints as opposed to
entire hypotheses: if it is “cheaper” to represent one or two datapoints than an entire
hypothesis – no matter how simple – then simply memorizing the data would have a
higher likelihood and a higher prior probability than an extremely vague, overgeneral
hypothesis. This is sensible in real-world terms: if I have only seen one recipe in
my entire life, it makes more sense to simply memorize it than to try to extract
general “recipe principles.”
Consider also our graphical example.
One datapoint
would require two choices to specify – its x and y coordinates. By contrast, even
the simplest hypothesis would require at least four (x, y, l, and w). Moreover, the
single datapoint also has the highest possible likelihood, since it predicts the data
52

(itself) exactly. Only as the number of datapoints increases does the penalty in the
prior become high enough to preclude simply memorizing each datapoint individually:
this is when overgeneral, highly simple hypotheses begin to be preferred. Precisely
how much data can be memorized depends on the representational complexity of the
hypotheses and data, but the basic qualitative pattern occurs widely.
This pattern looks a great deal like the U-shaped curve observed in a variety of
domains over the course of development (e.g., Marcus et al., 1992; Siegler, 2004). It
falls naturally out of the dynamics of learning, as the balance between simplicity and
goodness-of-ﬁt changes in response to increases in the amount of data.
Some general issues
Several issues are typically raised when evaluating Bayesian modelling as a serious
computational tool for cognitive science. Bayesian reasoning characterizes “optimal”
inference: what does this mean? How biologically plausible are these models, and
how much does this matter? And ﬁnally, where does it all come from – the hypothesis
space, the parameters, the representations? The answers to each of these questions
aﬀect what conclusions about actual human cognition we can draw on the basis of
Bayesian models; I will therefore consider each one in turn.
Optimality: What does it mean?
Bayesian probability theory6 is not simply a set of ad hoc rules useful for manipulating
and evaluating statistical information: it is also the set of unique, consistent rules for
6Bayesian methods are often contrasted to so-called “frequentist” approaches, which are the
basis for many of the standard statistical tests used in the social sciences, such as t-tests. Although
frequentist methods are often only appropriate for certain simple, idealized conditions that often fail
to describe reality, provide no way to take prior information account, and indeed constitute a special
case of Bayesian probability theory, Bayesian methods have historically been relatively neglected,
and often attacked, in part because they are viewed as unnecessarily subjective (R. Fisher, 1933;
Jeﬀreys, 1939; Savage, 1954; Lindley, 1956; Dantzig, 1957). This perception is untrue – Bayesian
methods are simply more explicit about the prior information they take into account. Regardless, the
issue of subjectivity seems particularly irrelevant for those interested in modelling human cognition,
where accurately capturing “subjective belief” is part of the point. (There has also been a great deal
of debate about the proper interpretation of probabilities within each framework; see the references
above, as well as Jaynes (2003), for an overview of this issue).
53

conducting plausible inference Jaynes (2003). In essence, it is a extension of deductive
logic to the case where propositions have degrees of truth or falsity – that is, it
is identical to deductive logic if we know all the propositions with 100% certainty.
Thus, just as formal logic describes a deductively correct way of thinking, Bayesian
probability theory describes an inductively correct way of thinking. As Laplace said,
“probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation.”
What does this mean? If we were to try to come up with a set of desiderata that a
system of “proper reasoning” should meet, they might include things like consistency
and qualitative correspondence with common sense – if you see some data supporting
a new proposition A, you should conclude that A is more plausible rather than less;
the more you think A is true, the less you should think it is false; if a conclusion
can be reasoned multiple ways, its probability should be the same regardless of how
you got there; etc. The basic axioms and theorems of probability theory, including
Bayes’ Rule, emerge when these desiderata are formalized mathematically (Cox, 1946,
1961), and correspond to common-sense reasoning and the scientiﬁc method (Jeﬀreys,
1931, 1939; de Finetti, 1974; Jaynes, 2003). Put another way, Bayesian probability
theory is “optimal inference” in the sense that a non-Bayesian reasoner attempting
to predict the future will always be out-predicted by a Bayesian reasoner in the long
run (de Finetti, 1937).
Even if the Bayesian framework captures optimal inductive inference, does that
mean it is an appropriate tool for modelling human cognition? People’s everyday
reasoning can be said to be many things, but few would aver that it is optimal, subject
as it is to emotions, heuristics, and biases of many diﬀerent sorts (e.g., Tversky &
Kahneman, 1974). However, even if humans are non-optimal thinkers in many ways
– and there is no reason to think they are in every way – it is impossible to know
this without being able to precisely specify what optimal thinking would amount to.
Understanding how humans do think is often made easier if one can identify the ways
in which people depart from the ideal: this is approximately the methodology by
which Kahneman and Tversky derived many of their famous heuristics and biases,
and the ﬂexibility of the Bayesian approach makes it relatively easy to incorporate
54

constraints based on memory, attention, or perception directly into one’s model.
Bayesian modelling, in fact, is an implementation of scientiﬁc inquiry that operates
on Marr’s third (computational) level, which seeks to understand cognition based
on what its goal is, why that goal would be appropriate, and the constraints on
achieving that goal, rather than precisely how it is implemented algorithmically (Marr,
1982). Understanding at this level is important because the nature of the reasoning
may often depend more on the learner’s goals and constraints than it does on the
particular implementation. It can also enhance understanding at the other levels: for
instance, analyzing connectionist networks as an implementation of a computational-
level theory can elucidate what sort of computations they perform, and often explain
why they produce the results they do (Hertz, Krogh, & Palmer, 1991; MacKay, 2004).
Being able to precisely specify and understand optimal reasoning is also useful for
performing ideal learnability analysis, which especially important in the area of cog-
nitive development. What must be “built into” the newborn mind in order to explain
how infants eventually grow to be adult reasoners, with adult knowledge? One way
to address this question is to establish the bounds of the possible: if some knowledge
couldn’t possibly be learned by an optimal learner presented with the type of data
children receive, it is safe to conclude that actual children couldn’t learn it, either7.
It would then be necessary to identify precisely what must be innate in order for that
knowledge to be learnable in principle. Due to its representational ﬂexibility and
its ability to accurately calculate optimal inference even on large datasets, Bayesian
modelling is an ideal tool for this sort of problem.
Biological plausibility
Because cognitive scientists are ultimately interested in understanding human cog-
nition, and human cognition is ultimately implemented in the brain, it is important
that our computational-level explanations be realizable on the neurological level, at
least potentially. This is one reason for the popularity of the connectionist approach,
which was developed as a neurally inspired model of the cognitive process (Rumelhart
7Assuming, of course, that the data in question accurately reﬂects children’s natural input.
55

& McClelland, 1986). Connectionist networks, like the brain, contain many highly
interconnected, active processing units (like neurons) that communicate with each
other by sending activation or inhibition through their connections. As in the brain,
learning appears to involve modifying connections, and knowledge is represented in a
distributed fashion over the connections. As a result, representations degrade grace-
fully with neural damage, and reasoning is probabilistic and “fuzzy.”
In contrast, Bayesian models may appear wholly implausible from the neurological
perspective. One of the major virtues of the Bayesian approach – the transparency
of its computations and the explicitness of its representation – is, in this light, poten-
tially a major ﬂaw: the brain is many wonderful things, but it is neither transparent
nor explicit. How could representations like grammars or logics be instantiated in our
neural hardware? How could our cortex encode hypotheses and compare them based
on a tradeoﬀbetween their simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt? Perhaps most problem-
atically, how could the brain – with a processing speed that is orders of magnitude
slower than that of modern computers – actually implement optimal inference, which
requires such a thorough search of such enormous hypothesis spaces that even the
fastest computers can take days or weeks, if they can succeed at all?
These are good questions, but there is growing evidence for the relevance of
Bayesian approaches on the neural level (e.g., Doya, Ishii, Pouget, & Rao, 2007).
Probability distributions can in fact be represented by neurons, and they can be
combined according to a close approximation of Bayes’ Rule; posterior probability
distributions may be encoded in populations of neurons in such a way that Bayesian
inference is achieved simply by summing up ﬁring rates (Pouget, Dayan, & Zemel,
2003; Ma, Beck, Latham, & Pouget, 2006).
Spiking neurons can be modeled as
Bayesian integrators accumulating evidence over time (Deneve, 2004; Zemel, Huys,
Natarajan, & Dayan, 2005). Recurrent neural circuits are capable of performing both
hierarchical and sequential Bayesian inference (Deneve, 2004; Rao, 2004, 2007). Even
speciﬁc brain areas have been studied: for instance, there is evidence that the recur-
rent loops in the visual cortex integrate top-down priors and bottom-up data in such
a way as to implement hierarchical Bayesian inference (Lee & Mumford, 2003).
56

This work, though still in its infancy, suggests that concerns about biological plau-
sibility may not, in the end, prove to be particularly problematic. It may seem to
us, used to working with serial computers, that searching these enormous hypothe-
sis spaces quickly enough to perform anything approximating Bayesian inference is
impossible; but the brain is a parallel computing machine made up of billions of
highly interconnected neurons. The sorts of calculations that take a long time on a
serial computer, like a sequential search of a hypothesis space, might be very easily
performed in parallel. Whatever the future holds, indications so far serve as a chas-
tening reminder of the danger of advancing from the “argument from incredulity” to
any conclusions about biological plausibility.
It is also important to note that, for all of their apparent biological plausibility,
neural networks are unrealistic in important ways, as many connectionist modelers
acknowledge.
Units in neural networks are assumed to have both excitatory and
inhibitory connections, which is not neurally plausible. This is a problem because
the primary learning mechanism, backpropagation, relies on the existence of such
connections (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986; Hertz et al., 1991). There is also no
analogue of neurotransmitters and other types of chemical transmission, which play
an important role in brain processes (Gazzaniga, Ivry, & Mangun, 2002). These issues
are being overcome as the state of the art advances (see Rao, Olshausen, and Lewicki
(2002) for some examples), but for the models most commonly used in cognitive
science – perceptrons, multilayered recurrent networks and Boltzmann machines –
they remain a concern.
The diﬀerent computational techniques are therefore each biologically plausible in
some ways and perhaps less so in others. Because we still know so little about the
neurological mechanisms within the brain, it is diﬃcult to characterize how plausible
either approach is or how much the ways they fall short impact their utility.
In
addition, to a large extent, biological plausibility is irrelevant on the computational
level of analysis. Even if it turned out that there was no possible way the brain
could implement anything (even heuristically) approximating Bayesian inference –
which seems unlikely in light of current research – Bayesian models would still be
57

useful for comprehending the goals and constraints faced by the cognitive system,
and for comparing actual human performance to optimal reasoning. To the extent
that connectionist models apply on the computational level, the same is true for them.
Where does it all come from?
For many, a more important critique is that it seems that, in some sense, Bayesian
models do not seem to be learning at all. The entire hypothesis space, as well as
the evaluation mechanism for comparing hypotheses, has been given by the modeler;
all the model does is choose among hypotheses that already exist. Isn’t learning,
particularly the sort of learning that children perform over the ﬁrst years of their life,
something more than this? Our intuitive notion of learning certainly encompasses a
spirit of discovery that does not appear at ﬁrst glance to be captured by a model that
simply does hypothesis testing within an already fully-speciﬁed hypothesis space.
The same intuition lies at the core of Fodor’s famous puzzle of concept acquisi-
tion (Fodor, 1975, 1981). His essential point is that one cannot learn anything via
hypothesis testing because one must possess it in order to test it in the ﬁrst place.
Therefore, except for those concepts that can be created by composing them from oth-
ers, all concepts – including concepts like CARBURETOR and GRANDMOTHER –
are, and must be, innate.
Fodor’s argument makes sense only under a very restricted, essentially un-intuitive
deﬁnition of what it means to learn. As an analogy, consider a standard English
typewriter with an inﬁnite amount of paper. There is a space of documents that
it is capable of producing, which includes things like The Tempest and does not
include, say, a Vermeer painting or a poem written in Russian. This typewriter can
easily be formalized in Bayesian terms where each document is a hypothesis and the
inﬁnite set of documents producible by the typewriter is its hypothesis space. (The
hypothesis space does not consist of the documents that the typewriter has actually
produced because a hypothesis space is not an exhaustive, explicitly enumerated set
of hypotheses8; rather, it is the latent space of possibilities that is implicitly deﬁned
8Indeed, exhaustive hypothesis enumeration is intractable for all but the simplest models; most
58

by the generative process).
Is there a diﬀerence between documents that have been created by the typewriter
and documents that exist only in the latent space? Of course there is: documents
that have been created can be manipulated in all sorts of ways (reading, burning,
discussing, editing) that documents latent in the space cannot. In the same way,
there may be a profound diﬀerence between hypotheses that have been considered
by the learner and hypotheses that are simply latent in the space: the former can
be manipulated by the cognitive system – evaluated, used in inference, compared to
other hypotheses – but the latter cannot. The process of transformation from an
implicit, latent hypothesis into one that can be manipulated by the cognitive system
is a process that looks, from most perspectives, rather like learning.
Only once
something is learned can we entertain it, talk about it, and manipulate it in other
ways; to say that it exists in the latent space simply means we have the capacity to
learn it. When I learn how to play chess, that means that I now identify chess pieces,
entertain strategies for winning, and talk about the rules with other players, whereas
before I didn’t (though I had the capacity to learn it).
Fodor’s argument, and this critique of Bayesian modelling, presumes a notion of
learning that is very diﬀerent from this, and indeed that is conceptually incoherent
in many ways.
If “learning” does not include acquiring some knowledge through
hypothesis testing, then what would it consist of? The knowledge would have to spring
into the hypothesis space somehow, but how? As we think about it further, we realize
that this critique assumes a deﬁnition of learning that only applies if new knowledge
enters the hypothesis space without any regularity or predictability whatsoever.
This can be proven by contradiction.
Imagine that I could explain how new
knowledge might be added to a hypothesis space; such an explanation would have to
make reference to some rules or some kind of process for adding things. That process
and those rules, however, would implicitly deﬁne a meta-space of their own. And
because this meta-space is pre-speciﬁed (implicitly, by that process or set of rules)
perform inference via guided search, and only some of the hypotheses within the space are actually
evaluated.
59

in the exact same way the original hypothesis space was pre-speciﬁed (implicitly, by
the original generative process), the hypotheses within it are “innate” in precisely the
same way that the original hypotheses were. In general, the only way for something
to be learned in the Fodorian sense – the sense that underlies this critique – is for
them to be able to spring, willy-nilly, into a hypothesis space in such a way that is
essentially random (i.e., unexplainable via some process or rule). If this is truly what
learning is, it seems to preclude the possibility of studying it scientiﬁcally; but luckily,
this is not what most of us mean by learning.
One consequence of this is that every model, even the brain, must come equipped
with a latent hypothesis space that consists of everything that it can possibly repre-
sent and compute; all learning must happen within this space. This is not a novel or
controversial point – all cognitive scientists accept that something must be built in
– but it is often forgotten as soon as a Bayesian model appears. Somehow, the fact
that hypotheses are explicit and hypothesis spaces are clearly deﬁned makes them
appear more “innate” than if they were simply latent in the model. But even con-
nectionist networks – which are often believed to presume very little in the way of
innate knowledge – implicitly deﬁne hypotheses and hypothesis spaces via their ar-
chitecture, functional form, learning rule, etc. In fact, connectionist networks can be
viewed as implementations of Bayesian inference (e.g., Funahashi, 1998; McClelland,
1998; MacKay, 2004), corresponding to a computational-level model whose hypoth-
esis space is a set of continuous functions (e.g., Funahashi, 1989; Stinchcombe &
White, 1989). This is a large space, to be sure, but Bayesian models can easily have
hypothesis spaces that are equivalently large.
Does this mean that there is no diﬀerence between Bayesian models and connec-
tionist networks? In one way, the answer is yes: because neural networks are universal
approximators (Hornik, Stinchcombe, & White, 1989), it is always possible to con-
struct one that is an implementation of a Bayesian model. In practice, however, the
answer is usually no: the two methods have very diﬀerent strengths and weaknesses,
and therefore their value as modelling tools varies depending on the questions being
60

asked.9 Bayesian models optimally trade oﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt;
connectionist models perform a similar tradeoﬀ, but generally non-optimally and in a
more ad hoc manner, avoiding overﬁtting by limiting the length of training and choos-
ing appropriate weights, learning rules, and network architecture.10 In the Bayesian
framework, what is built in is the generative process, which implicitly deﬁnes the
assignment of prior probabilities, the representation involved, and the size of the
hypothesis space; in the connectionist framework, these things are built in through
choices about the architecture, weights, learning rule, training procedure, etc.
It is therefore incorrect to say one framework assumes more innate knowledge than
another: speciﬁc models within each may assume more or less, but it can be quite
diﬃcult to compare them precisely, in part because connectionist networks incorpo-
rate it implicitly. Which model assumes more innate knowledge is often not even the
interesting question. A more appropriate one might be: what innate knowledge does
it assume? Instead of asking whether one representation is a stronger assumption
than another, it is often more productive to ask which predicts human behavior bet-
ter. The answer will probably depend on the problem and the domain, but the great
advantage of computational modelling is that it allows us to systematically explore
this dependence precisely. And an advantage of Bayesian modelling in particular is
that we can be explicit about what assumptions we are making, thus facilitating that
exploration.
One thing that is often overlooked in evaluating what is built into computational
models is preprocessing: any model – Bayesian approaches as well as neural networks
– requires the data to be entered in a usable form. If there is too much preprocessing,
or too much of the wrong sort, it can be diﬃcult to tell if the interesting learning
has been done by the model or the modeler. This is a general problem confronted
by any computational modeler, and is one of the reasons for the truism that “every
model is wrong.” Unless we can give the model completely raw, un-preprocessed data
9Many connectionist modelers see the two approaches as complementary (e.g., Rogers & McClel-
land, 2004), and I agree with this view.
10There is an interesting subﬁeld called Bayesian neural networks studying how to construct
models that make these choices for themselves, pruning connections in a Bayes-optimal way (e.g.,
MacKay, 1995; Neal, 1994, 1996).
61

– and the model is a complete copy of the brain itself – we will be simplifying and
introducing error somehow. Of course, if we do that, we then won’t have learned
anything: the point of modelling is to simplify, and to hope that we have done so
in such a way that it adds to our understanding rather than detracts. The ultimate
aim is to develop models that take data that is preprocessed less and less; we are not
there yet, but Bayesian models are a powerful tool toward that end.
Conclusion
Bayesian modelling is a useful approach in cognitive science, especially when used
in conjunction with other types of computational modelling as well as experimental
work. Its representational ﬂexibility makes the Bayesian approach applicable to a
wide variety of learning problems, and its transparency makes it easy to be clear
about what assumptions are being made and what is being learned. The framework
is valuable for deﬁning an optimal standard as well as for exploring and illustrating
the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt. As a result, it has the potential
to explain many aspects of human cognition.
In the next chapters I present speciﬁc Bayesian models that address problems
in three particular areas of language acquisition. We will see how the principles of
Bayesian inference, presented here in a more abstract form, come into play in each of
these speciﬁc contexts.

Chapter 3
The acquisition of abstract
linguistic structure
Chapter 1 introduced a classic learnability argument that moves from the phenomenon
of auxiliary fronting in English interrogatives to the conclusion that children must in-
nately know that syntactic rules are deﬁned over hierarchical phrase structures rather
than linear sequences of words (e.g., Chomsky, 1965, 1971, 1980; Crain & Nakayama,
1987). Here I use a Bayesian framework for grammar induction to argue for a dif-
ferent possibility. I show that, given typical child-directed speech and certain innate
domain-general capacities, an unbiased ideal learner could recognize the hierarchical
phrase structure of language without having this knowledge innately speciﬁed as part
of the language faculty. I discuss the implications of this analysis for accounts of
human language acquisition, and focus in particular about implications for Poverty
of the Stimulus arguments more generally.
Hierarchical phrase structure in language
Scientiﬁc inquiry in language acquisition was inﬂuenced by Chomsky’s observation
that language learners make grammatical generalizations that appear to go beyond
The work in this chapter was carried out in collaboration with Terry Regier and Joshua
Tenenbaum.
63

what is immediately justiﬁed by the evidence in the input (1965, 1980). One such class
of generalizations concerns the hierarchical phrase structure of language: children
appear to favor hierarchical rules that operate on grammatical constructs such as
phrases and clauses over linear rules that operate only on the sequence of words,
even in the apparent absence of direct evidence supporting this preference.
Such
a preference, in the absence of direct supporting evidence, is used to suggest that
human learners innately know a deep organizing principle of natural language, that
grammatical rules are deﬁned on hierarchical phrase structures.
The goal in this chapter is to reevaluate the modern PoS argument for innate
language-speciﬁc knowledge by formalizing the problem of language acquisition within
a Bayesian framework for rational inductive inference. I consider an ideal learner
who comes equipped with two powerful but domain-general capacities. First, the
learner has the capacity to represent structured grammars of various forms, including
hierarchical phrase-structure grammars (which the generative tradition argues must
be innately known to apply in the domain of language) and simpler non-hierarchical
alternatives (which the generative tradition claims must be innately inaccessible for
language learning, but that might be an appropriate model for sequential data in non-
linguistic domains). Second, the learner has access to a Bayesian engine for statistical
inference which can operate over these structured grammatical representations and
compute their relative probabilities given observed data. I will argue that a certain
core aspect of linguistic knowledge – the knowledge that syntactic rules are deﬁned
over hierarchically organized phrase structures – can be inferred by a learner with
these capabilities but without a language-speciﬁc innate bias favoring this conclusion.
Note that this claim about innateness is really a claim about the domain-speciﬁcity
of innate linguistic knowledge. Because language acquisition presents a problem of
induction, it is clear that learners must have some constraints limiting the hypotheses
they consider. The question is whether a certain feature of language – such as hierar-
chical phrase structure in syntax – must be assumed to be speciﬁed innately as part
of a language-speciﬁc “acquisition device”, rather than derived from more general-
purpose representational capacities and inductive biases. I introduce a speciﬁc issue
64

that has sparked many discussions of innateness, from Chomsky’s original discussions
to present-day debates: the phenomena of auxiliary fronting in constructing English
interrogative sentences (Laurence & Margolis, 2001; Lewis & Elman, 2001; Legate
& Yang, 2002; Pullum & Scholz, 2002; Reali & Christiansen, 2005). Nevertheless,
this analysis should not be seen as an attempt to explain the learnability of auxil-
iary fronting (or any speciﬁc linguistic rule) per se. Rather the goal is to address
the general phenomenon of hierarchical phrase structure in syntax – the phenomenon
that has been argued to underlie the learning of auxiliary fronting and many other
speciﬁc rules. I take as data an entire corpus of child-directed speech and evaluate
hypotheses about candidate grammars that could account for the corpus as a whole.
As a byproduct of this, the analysis allows us to explore the learnability of auxiliary
fronting and other related speciﬁc aspects of syntax.
The debate
As we saw in Chapter 1, Chomsky put forth several Poverty of the Stimulus arguments
for the claim that part of the initial state of the language acquisition system – and a
necessary feature of any possible hypothesis considered by the language learner – is
the knowledge that the rules of syntax are deﬁned over hierarchical phrase-structure
representations rather than a linear sequence of words.
I presented the following
abstract schema for PoS arguments in general:
1.1. (i) Children show a speciﬁc pattern of behavior B.
(ii) A particular generalization G must be grasped to produce behavior B.
(iii) It is impossible to reasonably induce G simply on the basis of the data D
that children receive.
(iv) ∴Some abstract knowledge T, limiting which speciﬁc generalizations G are
possible, is necessary.
This form of the PoS argument makes explicit the distinction between multiple
levels of knowledge – a distinction that I consider in one form or another throughout
65

Figure 3-1: Graphical depiction of the standard Poverty of Stimulus argument. Ab-
stract higher-level knowledge T is necessary to constrain the speciﬁc generalizations
G that are learned from the data D, and that govern behavior B.
this thesis, and also illustrate schematically in Figure 3-1. In the case of auxiliary
fronting, the speciﬁc generalization G refers to the hierarchical rule 1.3(b) in Chapter 1
that governs the formation of interrogative sentences (also shown, for ease of reference,
below). The learning challenge is to explain how children come to produce only the
correct forms for complex interrogatives (B), apparently following a hierarchical rule
like 1.3(b), when the data they observe (D) comprise only simple interrogatives (such
as “Is the man hungry?”) that do not discriminate between the correct generalization
and simpler but incorrect alternatives like the linear rule 1.3(a).
1.3. (a) Linear: Form the interrogative by moving the ﬁrst occurrence of the auxiliary
in the declarative to the beginning of the sentence.
(b) Hierarchical: Form the interrogative by moving the auxiliary from the main
clause of the declarative to the beginning of the sentence.
Note that the interesting claim of innateness here is not about the rule for pro-
ducing interrogatives (G) per se; rather, it concerns some more abstract knowledge
T. Nothing in the logical structure of the argument requires that T be speciﬁc to
the domain of language – constraints due to domain-general processing, memory, or
learning factors could also limit which generalizations are considered. Nevertheless,
many versions of the PoS argument assume that the T is language-speciﬁc: in partic-
ular, that T is the knowledge that linguistic rules are deﬁned over hierarchical phrase
66

structures rather than linear sequences of words. This knowledge constrains the spe-
ciﬁc rules of grammar that children may posit and therefore licenses the inference to
G. Constraints on grammatical generalizations at the level of T may be seen as one
aspect of, or as playing the role of, “universal grammar” (Chomsky, 1965).
As I have discussed, an advantage of this logical schema is to clarify that the
correct conclusion given the premises is not that the higher-level knowledge T is
innate – only that it is necessary. The following corollary is required to conclude that
T is innate:
1.2. (i) (Conclusion from above) Some abstract knowledge T is necessary.
(ii) T could not itself be learned, or could not be learned before the speciﬁc
generalization G is known.
(iii) ∴T must be innate.
Given this schema, the argument here can be construed in two diﬀerent ways. On
one view, I am arguing against premise 1.2(ii); I suggest that the abstract linguistic
knowledge T – that language has hierarchical phrase structure – might be learnable
using domain-general mechanisms and representational machinery. Given some ob-
served data D, I evaluate knowledge at both levels (T and G) together by drawing
on the methods of hierarchical Bayesian models and Bayesian model selection (A.
Gelman et al., 2004). Interestingly, these results suggest that less data is required to
learn T than to learn the speciﬁc grammar G.
On another view, I am not arguing with the form of the PoS argument, but
merely clarifying what content the knowledge T must have. I argue that phenomena
such as children’s mastery of auxiliary fronting are not suﬃcient to require that the
innate knowledge constraining generalization in language acquisition be language-
speciﬁc. Rather it could be based on more general-purpose systems of representation
and inductive biases that favor the construction of simpler representations over more
complex ones.
Other critiques of the innateness claim dispute the three premises of the original
argument, arguing either:
67

3.1. (a) Children do not show the pattern of behavior B.
(b) Behavior B is possible without having made the generalization G, through
some other route from D.
(c) It is possible to learn G on the basis of D alone, without the need for some
more abstract knowledge T
In the case of auxiliary fronting, one example of response 3.1(a) is the claim that
children do not in fact always avoid errors that would be best explained under a linear
rule rather than a hierarchical rule. Although Crain and Nakayama (1987) demon-
strated that children do not spontaneously form incorrect complex interrogatives such
as “Is the man who hungry is ordering dinner?” (1.5(b)), they make other mistakes
that are not so easily interpretable. For instance, one might utter a sentence like “Is
the man who is hungry is ordering dinner?”, which is not immediately compatible
with the correct hierarchical grammar but might be consistent with a linear rule.
Additionally, recent research by Ambridge, Rowland, and Pine (2005) suggests that 6
to 7 year-old children presented with auxiliaries other than is do indeed occasionally
form incorrect sentences along the lines of 1.5(a), such as “Can the boy who run fast
can jump high?”, as well as other kinds of errors.
A diﬀerent response, 3.1(c), accepts that children have inferred the correct hier-
archical rule for auxiliary fronting, but maintains that the input data is suﬃcient to
support this inference. If children observe suﬃciently many complex interrogative
sentences like 1.5(b) while observing no incorrect sentences like 1.5(a), then perhaps
they could learn directly that the hierarchical rule 1.3(b) is correct, or at least bet-
ter supported than simple linear alternatives. The force of this response depends
on how many grammatical complex interrogatives like 1.5(b) children actually hear.
While it is an exaggeration to say that there are no complex interrogatives in typi-
cal child-directed speech, they are certainly rare: Legate and Yang (2002) estimate
based on two CHILDES corpora1 that between 0.045% and 0.068% of all sentences
are complex interrogative forms. Is this enough? Unfortunately, in the absence of
1Adam (Brown corpus, 1973) and Nina (Suppes corpus, 1973); for both, see MacWhinney (2000).
68

a speciﬁc learning mechanism, it is diﬃcult to develop an objective standard about
what would constitute “enough.” Legate & Yang attempt to establish one by com-
paring how much evidence is needed to learn other generalizations that are acquired
at around the same age; they conclude on this basis that the evidence is probably in-
suﬃcient. However, such a comparison overlooks the role of indirect evidence, which
has been suggested to contribute to learning in a variety of other contexts (Landauer
& Dumais, 1997; Regier & Gahl, 2004; Reali & Christiansen, 2005).
Indirect evidence also plays a role in the second type of reply, 3.1(b), which is
probably the most currently popular line of response to the PoS argument. The claim
is that children could still show the correct pattern of linguistic behavior – acceptance
or production of sentences like 1.5(b) but not 1.5(a) – even without having learned
any grammatical rules like 1.3(a) or 1.3(b) at all.
Perhaps the data, while poor
with respect to complex interrogative forms, are rich in distributional and statistical
regularities that would distinguish the linear rule 1.3(a) from the hierarchical rule
1.3(b). If children pick up on these regularities, that could be suﬃcient to explain
why they avoid incorrect complex interrogative sentences like 1.5(a), without any
need to posit the kinds of grammatical rules that others have claimed to be essential
(Redington, Chater, & Finch, 1998; Lewis & Elman, 2001; Reali & Christiansen,
2004, 2005).
For instance, Lewis and Elman (2001) trained a simple recurrent network to pro-
duce sequences generated by an artiﬁcial grammar that contained sentences of the
form AUX NP ADJ? and Ai NP Bi, where Ai and Bi stand for inputs of random
content and length. They found that the trained network predicted sentences like “Is
the boy who is smoking hungry?” with higher probability than similar but incorrect
sequences, despite never having received that type of sentence as input. In related
work, Reali and Christiansen (2005) showed that the statistics of actual child-directed
speech support such predictions. They demonstrated that simple bigram and trigram
models applied to a corpus of child-directed speech gave higher likelihood to correct
complex interrogatives than to incorrect interrogatives, and that the n-gram models
correctly classiﬁed the grammaticality of 96% of test sentences like 1.5(a) and 1.5(b).
69

They also argued that simple recurrent networks could distinguish grammatical from
ungrammatical test sentences because they were able to pick up on the implicit sta-
tistical regularities between lexical classes in the corpus.
Though these statistical-learning responses to the PoS argument are important
and interesting, they have two signiﬁcant disadvantages. First of all, the behavior of
connectionist models tends to be diﬃcult to understand analytically. For instance, the
networks used by Reali and Christiansen (2005) and Lewis and Elman (2001) measure
success by whether they predict the next word in a sequence or by comparing the
prediction error for grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. These networks lack
not only a grammar-like representation; they lack any kind of explicitly articulated
representation of the knowledge they have learned. It is thus diﬃcult to say what
exactly they have learned about linguistic structure.
Second, by denying that explicit structured representations play an important role
in children’s linguistic knowledge, these statistical-learning models fail to engage with
the motivation at the heart of the PoS arguments and most contemporary linguistics.
PoS arguments begin with the assumption – taken by most linguists as self-evident –
that language does have explicit hierarchical structure, and that linguistic knowledge
must at some level be based on representations of syntactic categories and phrases
that are hierarchically organized within sentences. The PoS arguments are about
whether and to what extent children’s knowledge about this structure is learned via
domain-general mechanisms, or is innate in some language-speciﬁc system. Critiques
based on the premise that this explicit structure is not represented as such in the
minds of language users do not really address this argument (although they may
be valuable in their own right by calling into question the broader assumption that
linguistic knowledge is structured and symbolic). The work here is premised on tak-
ing seriously the claim that knowledge of language is based on structured symbolic
representations. We can then investigate whether the principle that these linguistic
representations are hierarchically organized might be learned. I do not claim that
linguistic representations must have explicit structure, but assuming such a represen-
tation allows us to engage with the PoS argument on its own terms.
70

Overview
I present two main results. First of all, I demonstrate that a learner equipped with
the capacity to explicitly represent both linear and hierarchical grammars – but with-
out any initial bias to prefer either in the domain of language – can infer that the
hierarchical grammar is a better ﬁt to typical child-directed input, even on the basis
of as little as a few hours of conversation. These results suggest that at least in this
particular case, it is possible to acquire domain-speciﬁc knowledge about the form
of structured representations via domain-general learning mechanisms operating on
type-based data from that domain. Secondly, I show that the hierarchical grammar
favored by the model – unlike the other grammars it considers – masters auxiliary
fronting, even when no direct evidence to that eﬀect is available in the input data.
This second point is simply a by-product of the main result, but it provides a valu-
able connection to the literature and makes concrete the beneﬁts of learning abstract
linguistic principles.
These results emerge because an ideal learner must trade oﬀsimplicity and goodness-
of-ﬁt in evaluating hypotheses, just as we saw in Chapter 2. The notion that inductive
learning should be constrained by a preference for simplicity is widely shared among
scientists, philosophers of science, and linguists. Chomsky himself concluded that
natural language is not ﬁnite-state based on informal simplicity considerations (1956,
1957), and suggested that human learners rely on an evaluation procedure that in-
corporates simplicity constraints (1965). Just as hypothesis B oﬀers the “just right”
balance between simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt in Figure 2-2, I argue that in a simi-
lar way, a hierarchical phrase-structure grammar yields a better tradeoﬀthan linear
grammars between simplicity of the grammar and ﬁt to typical child-directed speech.
But although these ﬁndings suggest that the speciﬁc feature of hierarchical structure
can be learned without an innate language-speciﬁc bias, I do not argue or believe that
all interesting aspects of language will have this characteristic.
One ﬁnding of this work is that it may require less data to learn a higher-order
principle T – such as the hierarchical nature of linguistic rules – than to learn every
71

correct generalization G at a lower level, e.g., every speciﬁc rule of English. Though
this model does not explicitly use inferences about the higher-order knowledge T
to constrain inferences about speciﬁc generalizations G, in theory T could provide
eﬀective and early-available constraints on G, even if T is not itself innately speciﬁed.
Throughout this thesis I investigate what drives this perhaps counterintuitive result
and discuss its implications for language acquisition and cognitive development more
generally.
Method
I cast the problem of grammar induction within a hierarchical Bayesian framework2
whose structure is shown in Figure 3-2.
The goal of the model is to infer from
some data D (a corpus of child-directed language) both the speciﬁc grammar G
that generated the data as well as the higher-level generalization about the type of
grammar T that G is an instance of. This is formalized as an instance of Bayesian
model selection.
The framework assumes a multi-stage probabilistic generative model for linguistic
utterances, which can then be inverted by a Bayesian learner to infer aspects of
the generating grammar from the language data observed.
A linguistic corpus is
generated by ﬁrst picking a type of grammar T from the prior distribution p(T). A
speciﬁc grammar G is then chosen as an instance of that type, by drawing from the
conditional probability distribution p(G|T). Finally, a corpus of data D is generated
from the speciﬁc grammar G, drawing from the conditional distribution p(D|G). The
inferences we can make from the observed data D to the speciﬁc grammar G and
grammar type T are captured by the joint posterior probability p(G, T|D), computed
via Bayes’ rule:
2Note that the “hierarchical” of “hierarchical Bayesian framework” is not the same “hierarchical”
as in “hierarchical phrase structure.” The latter refers to the hierarchical embedding of linguistic
phrases within one another in sentences. The former refers to a Bayesian model capable of performing
inference at multiple levels, in which not only the model parameters but also the hyperparameters
(parameters controlling priors over the parameters) are inferred from the data, rather than being
set by the modeler.
72

Figure 3-2: A hierarchical Bayesian model for assessing Poverty of Stimulus argu-
ments. The model is organized around the same structure as Figure 3-1, but now
each level of representation deﬁnes a probability distribution for the level below it.
Bayesian inference can be used to make inferences at higher levels from observations
at lower levels. Abstract principles of the grammar T constrain the speciﬁc gram-
matical generalizations G a learner will consider by deﬁning a conditional probability
distribution p(G|T). These generalizations in turn deﬁne probabilistic expectations
about the data D to be observed, p(D|G). Innate biases for speciﬁc types of gram-
mars can be encoded in the prior p(T), although here I consider an unbiased prior,
with p(T) equal for all T.
p(G, T|D) ∝p(D|G)p(G|T)p(T).
(3.1)
We wish to explore learning when there is no innate bias towards grammars with
hierarchical phrase structure. This is implemented in this model by assigning p(T)
to be equal for each type T. The prior for a speciﬁc grammar p(G|T) is calculated
assuming a generative model of grammars that assigns higher prior probability to
simpler grammars. The likelihood p(D|G) reﬂects the probability of the corpus of
child-directed speech D given G and T; it is a measure of how well the grammar
ﬁts the corpus data. The Bayesian approach to inferring grammatical structure from
data, in the form of the posterior p(G, T|D), thus automatically seeks a grammar
that balances the tradeoﬀbetween complexity (prior probability) and ﬁt to the data
(likelihood).
73

Relation to previous work
Probabilistic approaches to grammar induction have a long history in linguistics. One
strand of work concentrates on issues of learnability (e.g., Solomonoﬀ, 1964, 1978;
Horning, 1969; Li & Vit`anyi, 1997; Chater & Vit`anyi, 2003, 2007). This work is close
to ours in intent, because much of it is framed in response to the negative learnability
claims of Gold (1967), and demonstrates that learning a grammar in a probabilistic
sense is possible if the learner makes certain assumptions about the statistical distri-
bution of the input sentences (Horning, 1969; Angluin, 1988). Part of the power of
the Bayesian approach derives from its incorporation of a simplicity metric: an ideal
learner with such a metric will be able to predict the sentences of the language with
an error that approaches zero as the size of the corpus goes to inﬁnity (Solomonoﬀ,
1978), suggesting that learning from positive evidence alone may be possible (Chater
& Vit`anyi, 2007). This analysis is complementary to these previous Bayesian analy-
ses. The main diﬀerence is that instead of addressing learnability issues in abstract
and highly simpliﬁed settings, I focus on a speciﬁc question – the learnability of hi-
erarchical structure in syntax – and evaluate it on realistic data: a ﬁnite corpus of
child-directed speech. As with the input data that any child observes, this corpus
contains only a fraction of the syntactic forms in the language, and probably a biased
and noisy sample at that.
Another strand of related work is focused on computational approaches to learn-
ing problems (e.g.,
Eisner, 2002; Johnson & Riezler, 2002; Light & Greiﬀ, 2002;
Klein & Manning, 2004; Alishahi & Stevenson, 2005; Chater & Manning, 2006). This
analysis is distinct in several ways. First, many approaches focus on the problem of
learning a grammar given built-in constraints T, rather than on making inferences
about the nature of T as well. For instance, Klein and Manning (2004) have explored
unsupervised learning for a simple class of hierarchical phrase-structure grammars
(dependency grammars) from natural corpora. They assume that this class of hier-
archical grammars is ﬁxed for the learner rather than considering the possibility that
grammars in other classes, such as linear grammars, could be learned.
74

A more important diﬀerence in this analysis lies in the nature of the corpora.
Other work incorporates either on small fragments of (sometimes artiﬁcial) corpora
(e.g., Dowman, 2000; Alishahi & Stevenson, 2005; A. Clark & Eyraud, 2006) or on
large corpora of adult-directed speech (e.g., Eisner, 2002; Klein & Manning, 2004).
Neither is ideal for addressing learnability questions. Large corpora of adult-directed
speech are more complex than child-directed speech, and do not have the sparse-data
problem assumed to be faced by children. Analyses based on small fragments of a
corpus can be misleading: the simplest explanation for limited subsets of a language
may not be the simplest within the context of the entire system of linguistic knowledge
the child must learn.
An ideal analysis of learnability
This analysis views learnability in terms of an ideal framework in which the learner is
assumed to be able to eﬀectively search over the joint space of G and T for grammars
that maximize the Bayesian scoring criterion. (In other words, we set aside one learn-
ability issue, centered on the computational tractability of performing the search, to
focus on the issue of suﬃciency of the data. We address the implications of this
focus in the discussion). This proposal is therefore not a comprehensive or mechanis-
tic account of how children actually acquire language; the full problem of language
acquisition poses many challenges that I do not consider here. Rather, this analysis
provides a formal framework for analyzing the learnability of some aspects of linguistic
syntax, with the goal of clarifying and exploring claims about what language-speciﬁc
prior knowledge must be assumed in order to make learning possible. I discuss the
reasoning behind performing this sort of ideal learnability analysis in far more detail
in Chapters 2 and 6, but the essential goal is to follow the spirit of how Chomsky
and other linguists have considered learnability: as a question of what is learnable
in principle. Is it in principle possible given the data a child observes to learn that
language is governed by hierarchical phrase-structure rules, rather than linear rules,
if one is not innately biased to consider only hierarchical grammars? If we can show
that such learning is in principle possible, then it becomes meaningful to ask the
75

algorithmic-level question of how a system might successfully and in reasonable time
search the space of possible grammars to discover the best-scoring grammar.
Of course, the value of this ideal learnability analysis depends on whether the
speciﬁc grammars I consider are representative of the best hypotheses that can be
found in the full spaces of diﬀerent grammar types we are interested in (the spaces
of hierarchical phrase-structure grammars, linear grammars, and so on). I therefore
examine grammars generated in a variety of ways:
(1) The best hand-designed grammar of each grammar type.
(2) The best grammars found via local search, using the grammar from (1) as the
starting point.
(3) The best grammars found in a completely automated fashion
Because I restrict the analysis to grammars that can successfully parse the corpora,
I will explain the corpora before moving on to a more detailed description of the
process of inference and search and ﬁnally the grammars.
The corpora
The corpus consists of the sentences spoken by adults in the Adam corpus (Brown,
1973) of the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000). In order to focus on gram-
mar learning rather than lexical acquisition, each word is replaced by its syntactic
category.3 Although learning a grammar and learning a lexicon are probably tightly
linked, I believe that this is a sensible starting assumption for several reasons: ﬁrst,
because grammars are deﬁned over these syntactic categories, and second, because
there is some evidence that aspects of syntactic-category knowledge may be in place
even in very young children (Booth & Waxman, 2003; Gerken, Wilson, & Lewis,
3Parts of speech used included determiners (det), nouns (n), adjectives (adj), comments like
“mmhm” (c), prepositions (prep), pronouns (pro), proper nouns (prop), inﬁnitives (to), participles
(part), inﬁnitive verbs (vinf), conjugated verbs (v), auxiliaries (aux), complementizers (comp), and
wh-question words (wh). Adverbs and negations were removed from all sentences. Additionally,
whenever the word what occurred in place of another syntactic category (as in a sentence like “He
liked what?” the original syntactic category was used; this was necessary in order to simplify the
analysis of all grammar types, and was only done when the syntactic category was obvious from the
sentence.
76

2005). In addition, ungrammatical sentences and the most grammatically complex
sentence types are removed from the corpus.4 The complicated sentence types are
removed for reasons of computational tractability as well as the diﬃculty involved
in designing grammars for them, but this is if anything a conservative move since
these results suggest that the hierarchical grammars will be more preferred as the
input grows more complex. The ﬁnal corpus contains 21671 individual sentence to-
kens corresponding to 2336 unique sentence types, out of 25755 tokens in the original
corpus.5
In order to explore how the preference for a grammar depends on the amount
of data available to the learner, I create six smaller corpora as subsets of the main
corpus. Under the reasoning that the most frequent sentences are most available as
evidence and are therefore the most likely to be understood, diﬀerent corpus Levels
contain only those sentence forms whose tokens occur with a certain frequency or
higher in the full corpus. The levels are: Level 1 (contains all forms occurring 500
or more times, corresponding to 8 unique types); Level 2 (100 times, 37 types); Level
3 (50 times, 67 types); Level 4 (10 times, 268 types); Level 5 (5 times, 465 types);
and the complete corpus, Level 6, with 2336 unique types, including interrogatives,
wh-questions, relative clauses, prepositional and adjective phrases, command forms,
and auxiliary and non-auxiliary verbs. The larger corpora include the rarer and more
complex forms, and thus levels roughly correspond to complexity as well as quantity
of data.6
An additional variable of interest is what evidence is available to the child at
diﬀerent ages. As in Chapter 5, I approximate this by splitting the corpora into ﬁve
equal sizes by age. The Adam corpus has 55 ﬁles, so I deﬁne the earliest (Epoch 1)
corpus as the ﬁrst 11 ﬁles. The Epoch 2 corpus corresponds to the cumulative input

subordinate phrases (845), sentential complements (1636), conjunctions (634), serial verb construc-
tions (460), and ungrammatical sentences (443).
5The ﬁnal corpus contained forms corresponding to 7371 sentence fragments. In order to ensure
that the high number of fragments did not aﬀect the results, all analyses were replicated for the
corpus with those sentences removed. There was no qualitative change in the ﬁndings.

corpus. Splitting the corpus in this way is not meant to reﬂect the data that children
necessarily use at each age, but it does reﬂect the sort of data that is available.
The hypothesis space of grammars and grammar types
Because this work is motivated by the distinction between hierarchical and linear
rules, I wish to compare grammar types T that diﬀer from each other structurally
in the same way. Diﬀerent Bayesian approaches to evaluating alternative grammar
types are possible. In particular, we could score a grammar type T by integrating the
posterior probability over all speciﬁc grammars G of that type (P
G p(T, G|D)) or by
choosing the best G of that type (maxGp(T, G|D)). Integrating over all grammars
is computationally intractable, and arguably also less relevant. Ultimately it is the
speciﬁc grammar G that governs how the learner understands and produces language,
so we should be interested in ﬁnding the best pair of T and G jointly. I therefore
compare grammar types by comparing the probability of the best speciﬁc grammars
G of each type.
There are various formal frameworks we could use to represent hierarchical or
linear grammars as probabilistic generative systems. Each of these grammars consists
of a set of production rules, specifying how one non-terminal symbol (the left-hand
side of the rule) in a string may be rewritten in terms of other symbols, terminal or
non-terminal. These grammars can all be deﬁned probabilistically: each production
is associated with a probability, such that the probabilities of all productions with
the same left-hand sides add to one and the probability of a complete parse is the
product of the probabilities of the productions involved in the derivation.
To represent hierarchical systems of syntax, I choose context-free grammars (CFGs).
Context-free grammars are arguably the simplest approach to capturing the phrase
structure of natural language in a way that deals naturally with hierarchy and recur-
sion. Since the 1950s, they have often been treated as a ﬁrst approximation to the
structure of natural language since the early period of generative linguistics (Chomsky,
1959). Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) are a probabilistic generaliza-
78

tion of CFGs commonly used in statistical natural language processing (Manning &
Sch¨utze, 1999; Jurafsky & Martin, 2000), and I incorporate powerful tools for sta-
tistical learning and inference with PCFGs in this work here. I recognize that there
are also many aspects of syntax that cannot be captured naturally in CFGs. In par-
ticular, they do not express the sort of movement rules that underlie some standard
generative accounts of aux-fronting: they do not represent the interrogative form
of a sentence as a transformed version of a simpler declarative form. I work with
CFGs because they are the simplest and most tractable formalism suitable for this
purposes here – assessing the learnability of hierarchical phrase structure in syntax –
but in future work it would be valuable to extend these analyses to richer syntactic
formalisms.
I consider three diﬀerent approaches for representing linear grammars. The ﬁrst is
based on regular grammars, also known as ﬁnite-state grammars. Regular grammars
were originally proposed by Chomsky as a “minimal linguistic theory”, a kind of “null
hypothesis” for syntactic theory. They are models capable of producing a potentially
inﬁnite set of strings, but in a manner that is sensitive only to the linear order of
words and not the hierarchical structure of syntactic phrases. A second approach,
which I call the FLAT grammar, is simply a memorized list of each of the sentence
types (sequences of syntactic categories) that occur in the corpus (2336 productions,
zero non-terminals aside from S). This grammar will maximize goodness-of-ﬁt to
the data at the cost of great complexity. Finally, I consider the one-state (1-ST)
grammar, which maximizes simplicity by sacriﬁcing goodness-of-ﬁt. It permits any
syntactic category to follow any other and is equivalent to a ﬁnite automaton with
one state in which all transitions are possible (and is similar to a standard unigram
model). Though these three approaches may not capture exactly what was originally
envisioned as linear grammars, I work with them because they are representative of
simple syntactic systems that can be deﬁned over a linear sequence of words rather
than the hierarchical structure of phrases, and they are all easily deﬁned in proba-
bilistic terms.
79

Hand-designed grammars
The ﬁrst method for generating the speciﬁc grammars for each type is to design
by hand the best grammar possible. The ﬂat grammar and the one-state grammar
exist on the extreme opposite ends of the simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt spectrum: the
ﬂat grammar, as a list of memorized sentences, oﬀers the highest possible ﬁt to the
data (exact) and the lowest possible compression (none), while the one-state grammar
oﬀers the opposite. I design both context-free and regular grammars that span the
range between these two extremes (much as the models in Figure 2-2 do); within
each type, speciﬁc grammars diﬀer systematically in how they capture the tradeoﬀ
between simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt. Table 3.1 contains sample productions from
each of the speciﬁc grammars.7
I consider two speciﬁc probabilistic context-free grammars in this analysis. The
smaller grammar, CFG-S, can parse all of the forms in the full corpus and is based
on standard syntactic categories (e.g., noun, verb, and prepositional phrases). The
full CFG-S, used for the Level 6 corpus, contains 14 non-terminal categories and 69
productions. All grammars for other corpus levels and epochs include only the subset
of productions and items necessary to parse that corpus.
CFG-L is a larger grammar (14 non-terminals, 120 productions) that ﬁts the data
more precisely but at the cost of increased complexity.
It is identical to CFG-S
except that it contains additional productions corresponding to diﬀerent expansions
of the same non-terminal. For instance, because a sentence-initial Vinf may have
a diﬀerent statistical distribution over its arguments than the same Vinf occurring
after an auxiliary, CFG-L contains both [Vinf →Vinf PP] and [Vinf →vi PP]
whereas CFG-S includes the former only. Because of its additional expansions, CFG-
L places less probability mass on the recursive productions, which ﬁts the data more
precisely. Both grammars have approximately the same expressive power, but balance
the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt in diﬀerent ways.
I consider three regular grammars spanning the range of the simplicity/goodness-

of-ﬁt tradeoﬀjust as the context-free grammars do. All three fall successively between
the extremes represented by the ﬂat and one-state grammars, and are created from
CFG-S by converting all productions not already of the form [A →a] or [A →a B] to
one of these forms. (It turns out that there is no diﬀerence between converting from
CFG-S or CFG-L; the same regular grammar is created in any case. This is because
the process of converting a production like [A →B C] is equivalent to replacing B by
all of its expansions, and CFG-L corresponds to CFG-S with some B items replaced.)
When possible without loss of generalizability, the resulting productions are simpliﬁed
and any productions not used to parse the corpus are eliminated.
The “narrowest” regular grammar, REG-N, oﬀers the tightest ﬁt to the data of
the three I consider. It has 85 non-terminals and 389 productions, some examples of
which are shown in Table 3.1. The number of productions is greater than in either
context-free grammar because it is created by expanding each context-free production
containing two non-terminals in a row into a series of distinct productions (e.g. [NP
→NP PP] expands to [NP →pro PP], [NP →n PP], etc). REG-N is thus more
complex than either context-free grammar, but it provides a much closer ﬁt to the
data – more like the ﬂat grammar than the one-state.
Just as CFG-S might result from collapsing diﬀerent expansions in CFG-L into
a single production, simpler regular grammars can be created by merging multiple
productions in REG-N together.
For instance, merging NPCP and NPPP into a
single non-terminal such as NP results in a grammar with fewer productions and
non-terminals than REG-N. Performing multiple merges of this sort results in a
“moderately complex” regular grammar (REG-M) with 169 productions and 13 non-
terminals. Because regular grammars are less expressive than context-free grammars,
REG-M still requires more productions than either context-free grammar, but it is
much simpler than REG-N. In theory, we can continue merging non-terminals to
create successively simpler grammars that ﬁt the corpus increasingly poorly until
we reach the one-state grammar, which has no non-terminals aside from S. A third,
“broader” regular grammar, REG-B, is the best performing of several grammars cre-
ated in this way from REG-M. It has 10 non-terminals and 117 productions and is

Grammars constructed by automated search
There is reason to believe that hand-designed grammars provide a good approximation
of the best grammar of each type. Both context-free grammars are designed based on
linguistic intuition, and the regular grammars are constructed from the context-free
grammars in order to preserve as much linguistic structure as possible. Furthermore,
grammars of all types have been chosen to reﬂect the range of tradeoﬀs between
simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt. It would nevertheless be ideal to search the space of
possible grammars and compare the resulting best grammars found for each type,
82

rather than simply comparing the best hand-designed grammars. Unfortunately, this
type of search for context-free grammars presents a diﬃcult computational problem,
and current search algorithms cannot be relied upon to ﬁnd the optimal grammar
of any given type on large-scale corpora. Fortunately, this argument requires only a
search over regular grammars: if the hand-designed context-free grammars are not
close to optimal but still have higher probability than the best regular grammars,
then the argument is reasonable, but the converse is not true.
I perform a fully-automated search of the space of regular grammars by apply-
ing an unsupervised algorithm for learning a trigram Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
to the corpora (Goldwater & Griﬃths, 2007). Though the algorithm was originally
developed for learning parts of speech from a corpus of words, it applies to the acqui-
sition of a regular grammar from a corpus of syntactic categories because the formal
description of both problems is similar. In both cases, one must identify the hidden
variables (parts of speech vs. non-terminals) that best explain the observed data (a
corpus of words vs. a corpus of syntactic categories), assuming that the variables
depend only on the previous sequence of variables and not on any additional struc-
ture. The output of the algorithm is the assignment of each syntactic category in
each sentence to the non-terminal that immediately dominates it; this corresponds to
a regular grammar containing those non-terminals and no others.8
As another comparison, I also perform a partial search over both regular and
context-free grammars using the best hand-designed grammar of that type as a start-
ing point. The partial search was inspired by the work of Stolcke and Omohundro
(1994), in which a space of grammars is searched via successive merging of states.
States (productions) that are redundant or overly speciﬁc are replaced with produc-
tions that are not. For more details, see the appendix.
8It is not assumed that each syntactic category has one corresponding non-terminal, or vice
versa; both may be ambiguous. Though the algorithm incorporates a prior that favors fewer hidden
variables (non-terminals), it requires the modeler to specify the maximum number of non-terminals
considered. I therefore tested all possibilities between 1 and 25. This range was chosen because it
includes the number of non-terminals of the best grammars (CFG-L: 21, CFG-S: 21, REG-B: 16,
REG-M: 16, REG-N: 86). Since the model is stochastic, I also repeated each run three times, with
N=10000 iterations each time. The grammars with the highest posterior probability at each level
are reported; they have between one and 20 non-terminals.
83

The probabilistic model
Inferences are calculated using Bayes’ rule, which combines the prior probability of
G and T with the likelihood that the corpus D was generated by that G and T.
Scoring the grammars: Prior probability
The prior probability of a grammar reﬂects its complexity. I formalize it using a
generative model under which each grammar is selected from the space of all grammars
of that type. More complex grammars are those that result from more (and more
speciﬁc) choices. As we saw in Chapter 2, this method of scoring simplicity is quite
general, not restricted to grammars or even language.
Just as the more complex
hypotheses in Figure 2-2 are those that require more free parameters to specify, more
complex probabilistic grammars G require more choices during the generation process.
If one were generating a grammar from scratch, one would have to make the series of
choices depicted in Figure 3-3, beginning with choosing the grammar type: one-state,
ﬂat, regular, or context-free. (Since the model is unbiased, the prior probability of
each of these is identical). One would then need to choose the number of non-terminals
n, and for each non-terminal k to generate Pk productions. These Pk productions,
which share a left-hand side, are assigned a vector of positive, real-valued production-
probability parameters θk. Because the productions Pk represent an exhaustive and
mutually exclusive set of alternative ways to expand non-terminal k, their parameters
θk must sum to one. Each production i has Ni right-hand side items, and each of
those items must be drawn from the grammar’s vocabulary V (set of non-terminals
and terminals). If we assume that each right-hand side item of each production is
chosen uniformly at random from the vocabulary V , the prior probability is:
p(G|T) = p(n)
n
Y
k=1
p(Pk)p(θk)
Pk
Y
i=1
p(Ni)
Ni
Y
j=1
1
V .
(3.2)
I model the probabilities of the number of non-terminals p(n), productions p(Pk),
and items p(Ni) as selections from a geometric distribution; production-probability
parameters p(θk) are sampled from a discrete approximation of a uniform distribution

appropriate for probability parameters (Dirichlet). This prior gives higher probability
to simpler grammars – those with few non-terminals, productions, and items. Because
of the small numbers involved, all calculations are done in the log domain.
The
appendix contains further details.
The subsets of grammars that can be generated by the several grammar types I
consider are not mutually exclusive. A particular grammar – that is, a particular
vocabulary and set of productions – might be generated under more than grammar
type and would receive diﬀerent prior probabilities under diﬀerent grammar types. In
general, a grammar with a certain number of productions, each of a certain size, has
the highest prior probability if it can be generated as a one-state or ﬂat grammar, next
as a regular grammar, and the lowest as a context-free grammar. One-state and ﬂat
grammars are a subset of regular grammars, which are a subset of context-free gram-
mars (see Figure 3-4). All other things being equal, one has to make fewer “choices”
in order to generate a speciﬁc regular grammar from the class containing only regular
grammars than from the class of context-free grammars. However, because regular
and ﬂat grammars are less expressive, relatively more complex grammars of those
types may be required in order to parse all sentences in larger corpora.
This preference for the simplest grammar type is related to the Bayesian Occam’s
razor (MacKay, 2004). Other ways to measure simplicity could be based on notions
86

such as minimum description length or Kolmogorov complexity (Li & Vit`anyi, 1997;
Chater & Vit`anyi, 2003, 2007). These have been useful for the induction of speciﬁc
context-free grammars G (e.g., Dowman, 1998), and reﬂect a similar intuitive idea
of simplicity.
Scoring the grammars: Likelihood
The likelihood p(D|G) can be deﬁned straightforwardly for any probabilistic context-
free grammar or regular grammar by assuming that each sentence in the corpus is
generated independently from the grammar. This is the standard approach in prob-
abilistic grammar induction (e.g., Stolcke & Omohundro, 1994; Manning & Sch¨utze,
1999). However, this assumption is not well-matched to the induction problem we
address here. Most centrally, these models generate a statistical distribution of sen-
tences that diﬀers systematically from the statistics of natural language in a way that
might be expected to lead to a bias in grammar induction. In particular, they produce
distributions that do not capture the well-attested power law organization of language
(e.g.,
Zipf, 1932).9 They also fail to capture the actual causal process underlying
language production. Many factors – discourse requirements, semantics, priming and
salience eﬀects, subjective preference, the conversational context, etc. – all aﬀect
which sentences are spoken that are not captured by the production probabilities of
the grammar; a model that presumes that sentences are emitted independently from
one another based on those probabilities is therefore descriptively and explanatorily
inadequate.
Motivated by the fact that conventional probabilistic grammars that generate
every sentence independently fail to capture the power-law statistics of natural lan-
guage, Goldwater, Griﬃths, and Johnson (2006) introduced a modiﬁed approach to
grammar induction known as adaptor grammars (see also Johnson, Griﬃths, and
Goldwater (2007)). I adopt a version of their approach here. In the adaptor grammar
framework, the likelihood is calculated assuming a language model that is divided
into two components. The ﬁrst component, the generator, assigns a probability dis-
9See also Briscoe (2006) for a more recent overview.
87

tribution over the potentially inﬁnite set of syntactic forms that are accepted in the
language. The generator can naturally take the form of a traditional probabilistic gen-
erative grammar, such as a PCFG. (I sometimes refer to this component as simply the
“grammar”). The second component, the adaptor, produces a ﬁnite observed corpus
through a nonparametric stochastic process that mixes draws from the generating
grammar with draws from a stored memory of previously produced sentence forms.
The adaptor component is primarily responsible for capturing the precise statistics of
observed utterance tokens, and unlike simpler traditional probabilistic grammars, it
can account naturally for the characteristic power-law distributions found in language.
An important special case of the adaptor framework, corresponding to particular
settings of the adaptor parameters10, evaluates a grammar based on the probabil-
ities it assigns to the set of sentence types occurring in a corpus, independent of
the frequencies with which these types occur (i.e., the sentence token frequencies).
Goldwater et al. (2006) note that this parallels – and gives a principled justiﬁcation
for – the standard linguistic practice of assessing grammars based on the forms they
produce rather than the precise frequencies of those forms. Since we are concerned
with grammar comparison rather than corpus generation, I focus in this work on the
ﬁrst component of the model. I thus take the data to consist of the set of sentence
types (i.e., distinct sequences of syntactic categories) that appear in the corpus, and
evaluate the likelihoods of candidate probabilistic grammars on that dataset.
It is important to note although the model is presented with type-based informa-
tion only, I do not presume that human children ignore token frequencies in general.11
The adaptor grammar framework explicitly captures people’s well-attested sensitiv-
ity to token-based frequency information via the adaptor component of the model; in
fact, to the extent that token-based frequencies follow a power-law distribution, the
adaptor framework captures that sensitivity better than more standard approaches.
10In which β = and α →0.
11There are two diﬀerent sorts of token-based frequency information, and the distinction between
the two is somewhat important. Much of the evidence demonstrating a sensitivity to this sort of
frequency information concerns the token frequency of individual lexical items. Sentence tokens, in
our model, correspond to the unique strings of syntactic sequences (e.g., n aux adj) rather than unique
lexical items such as dog or run. We do not presume that children ignore either kind of token-based
frequency information – simply that diﬀerent sorts of information are relevant to diﬀerent tasks.
88

The model corresponds to assuming that language users can generate the syntactic
forms of sentence tokens either by drawing on a memory store of familiar syntactic
types, or by consulting a deeper level of grammatical knowledge about how to gen-
erate the inﬁnite variety of acceptable syntactic forms in the language. Any sentence
type generated by the former system would originally have been generated from the
latter, but speakers need not consult their deep grammatical knowledge for every
sentence token they utter or comprehend.
It is the deeper grammatical knowledge used to generate the set of sentence types
– not the memory-based generation process that produces the observed frequency
of sentence tokens – that I am interested in here.
By focusing only on the ﬁrst
component of the language model (for which the data consists of sentence types) I
presume that token frequencies – while important in many phenomena in language
acquisition that I do not model here, including learning individual lexical items,
categories, or constructions, or for explaining performance eﬀects due to memory
or attention – may be less relevant to the problem of identifying which particular
sentence forms are grammatical or not. In the discussion I address this presumption
in more detail.
The likelihood assigned to a grammar based on a dataset of sentence types can
be interpreted as a measure of how well the grammar ﬁts or predicts the data. Like
simplicity, this notion of “ﬁt” may be understood in intuitive terms that have nothing
speciﬁcally to do with grammars or language. Consider again Figure 2-2: intuitively
it seems as if hypothesis B is more likely to be the source of the data than hypothesis
A, but why? If A were the correct model, it would be quite a coincidence that all of
the data points fall only in the regions covered by B. Likelihood is dependent on the
quantity of data observed: it would not be much of a coincidence to see just one or a
few data points inside B’s region if they were in fact generated by A, but seeing 1000
data points all clustered there – and none anywhere else – would be very surprising
if A were correct.
This probabilistic preference for the most speciﬁc grammar consistent with the
observed data is a version of the size principle in Bayesian models of concept learn-
89

ing and word learning (Tenenbaum & Griﬃths, 2001; Regier & Gahl, 2004; Xu &
Tenenbaum, 2007). As noted before, it can also be seen as a probabilistic version
of the subset principle (Wexler & Culicover, 1980; Berwick, 1986). The eﬀective set
of sentences that the probabilistic grammars can produce depends on several fac-
tors. All other things being equal, a grammar with more productions will produce
more distinct sentence types. But distinct sentences generated also depends on how
those productions relate to each other: how many have the same left-hand side (and
thus how much ﬂexibility there is in expanding any one non-terminal), whether the
productions can be combined recursively, and other subtle factors. The penalty for
overly general or ﬂexible grammars is computed in the parsing process, where we
consider all possible ways of generating a sentence under a given grammar and assign
probabilities to each derivation. The total probability that a grammar assigns over
all possible sentences (really, all possible parses of all possible sentences) must sum
to one, and so the more ﬂexible the grammar, the lower probability it will tend to
assign to any one sentence.
More formally, the likelihood p(D|G) measures the probability that the corpus
data D would be generated by the grammar G. This is given by the product of the
likelihoods of each sentence Sl in the corpus, assuming that each sentence is generated
independently from the grammar. If there are M unique sentence types in the corpus,
the corpus likelihood is given by:
p(D|G) =
M
Y
l=1
p(Sl|G).
(3.3)
The probability of any sentence type Sl given the grammar (p(Sl|G)) is the product
of the probabilities of the productions used to derive Sl. Thus, calculating likelihood
involves solving a joint parsing and parameter estimation problem: identifying the
possible parse for each sentence in the corpus, as well as calculating the parameters
for the production probabilities in the grammar. I use the inside-outside algorithm
to sum over all possible parses and ﬁnd the set of production probability parame-
ters that maximize the likelihood of the grammar on the observed data (Manning &
Sch¨utze, 1999; Johnson, 2006). I evaluate Equation 3.3 in the same way, using the
90

maximum-likelihood parameter values but integrating over all possible parses of the
corpus.12 Sentences with longer derivations will tend to be less probable, because
each production used contributes a factor less than one to the product in Equation
3.3. This notion of simplicity in derivation captures an inductive bias favoring gram-
mars that assign the observed sentences more economical derivations – a bias that is
distinct and complementary to that illustrated in Figure 2-2, which favors grammars
generating smaller languages that more tightly cover the observed sentences.
Results
The posterior probability of a grammar G is the product of the likelihood and the
prior. All scores are presented as log probabilities and thus are negative; smaller
absolute values correspond to higher probabilities.
Posterior probability on diﬀerent grammar types
Hand-designed grammars
Table 3.2 shows the prior, likelihood, and posterior probability of each handpicked
grammar on each corpus. When there is the least evidence in the input (corpus Level
1), the ﬂat grammar is preferred. As the evidence accumulates, the one-state grammar
scores higher. However, for the larger corpora (Level 4 and higher), a hierarchical
grammar always scores the highest, more highly than any linear grammar.
If linear grammars are a priori simpler than context-free grammars, why does
the prior probability favor context-free grammars on more complex corpora? Recall
that I considered only grammars that could parse all of the data. Though regular
and ﬂat grammars are indeed simpler than equivalently large context-free grammars,
linear grammars also have less expressivity: they have to use more productions to
parse the same corpus with the same ﬁt. With a large enough dataset, the amount

late likelihood under other assumptions, including (for instance) the assumption that all productions
with the same left-hand side have the same probability (g=1; see the appendix). Doing so results
in lower likelihoods but qualitatively identical outcomes in all cases.

of compression oﬀered by the context-free grammar is suﬃcient to overwhelm the
initial simplicity preference towards the others. This is evident by comparing the
size of each grammar for the smallest and largest corpora. On the Level 1 corpus,
the context-free grammars require more productions than do the linear grammars (17
productions for CFG-S; 20 for CFG-L; 17 for REG-N; 15 for REG-M; 14 for REG-B;
10 for 1-ST; 8 for FLAT). Thus, the hierarchical grammars have the lowest initial prior
probability. However, their generalization ability is suﬃciently great that additions to
the corpus require relatively few additional productions: the context-free grammars
that can parse the Level 6 corpus have 69 and 120 productions, in comparison to 117
(REG-B), 169 (REG-M), 389 (REG-N), 25 (1-ST), and 2336 (FLAT).
The ﬂat grammar has the highest likelihood on all corpora because, as a perfectly
memorized list of each of the sentence types, it does not generalize beyond the data
at all. The regular grammar REG-N has a relatively high likelihood because its many
productions capture the details of the corpus quite closely. The other regular gram-
mars and the context-free grammars have lower likelihoods because they generalize
more beyond the data; these grammars predict sentence types which have not (yet)
been observed, and thus they have less probability mass available to predict the sen-
tences that have in fact been observed. Grammars with recursive productions are
especially penalized in likelihood scores based on ﬁnite input. A recursive grammar
will generate an inﬁnite set of sentences that do not exist in any ﬁnite corpus, and
some of the probability mass is allocated to those sentences (although longer sentences
with greater depth of recursion are given exponentially lower probabilities). The one-
state grammar has the lowest possible likelihood because it accepts any sequence of
symbols as grammatical.
As the amount of data accumulates, the posterior increasingly favors the hier-
archical grammars: the linear grammars are either too complex or ﬁt the data too
poorly by comparison. This ideal learning analysis thus infers that the syntax of En-
glish, at least as represented by this corpus, is best explained using the hierarchical
phrase structures of context-free grammars rather than the linear structures of sim-
pler Markovian grammars. In essence, this analysis reproduces one of the founding
93

insights of generative grammar (Chomsky, 1956, 1957): hierarchical phrase-structure
grammars are better than Markovian linear grammars as models of the range of syn-
tactic forms found in natural language. Child learners could in principle make the
same inference, if they can draw on the same rational inductive principles.
Berwick (1982) presented a diﬀerent approach to formalizing the simplicity ar-
gument for hierarchical structure in syntax, using tools from automata theory and
Kolmogorov complexity. At a high level, this analysis and Berwick’s are similar, but
there are two important diﬀerences. First, I evaluate learnability of a sizeable and
realistic CFG for English on a natural corpus of child-directed speech, rather than
simple languages (e.g., palindrome or mirror-symmetry languages on a binary alpha-
bet) with idealized corpora (e.g., including all sentences generated by the grammar,
or all sentences up to some maximum length or depth of recursion). Second, rather
than considering only those grammars that ﬁt the corpus precisely and evaluating
them based only on their simplicity, I adopt a framework in which simplicity of the
grammar trades oﬀagainst how well the grammar ﬁts the particular corpus.
We can see where these diﬀerences matter in comparing the scores of particular
grammars at diﬀerent levels of evidence. Although regular grammars never receive the
highest score across grammars of all types, they all score higher on the smallest corpus
(Level 1) than do any of the hierarchical grammars. On most levels of evidence, at
least one regular grammar is preferred over CFG-L. CFG-L is in fact the grammar that
is ultimately favored on the full corpus, but it overgeneralizes far more than the regular
grammars, and for the smaller corpora the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and ﬁt weighs
against it.
Thus these results cannot be obviously predicted by simplicity-based
learnability analyses developed for artiﬁcial grammars on idealized corpora.
The
tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and degree of ﬁt, given the sparse and idiosyncratic nature
of child-directed language input, is critical to determining what kind of grammar an
ideal learner should acquire.
It is interesting that the smallest corpora are best accounted for by the ﬂat and
one-state grammars. The smallest corpus contains only eight sentence types, with
an average 1.6 words per sentence; thus, it is not surprising that it is optimal to
94

simply memorize the corpus. Why is the one-state grammar preferred on the Level 2
and Level 3 corpora? Its simplicity gives it a substantial advantage in the prior, but
we might expect it to suﬀer greatly in the likelihood because it can predict literally
any sequence of syntactic categories as a possible sentence. The low likelihood does
wind up ruling out the one-state grammar on larger but not smaller corpora: this is
because the likelihood is not completely uninformative since it can encode the relative
probability of each of the syntactic categories. Though this minimal model never ﬁts
the data well, it doesn’t ﬁt the smaller corpora so poorly as to overcome the advantage
due to the prior. This suggests that simply encoding the statistical distribution of
syntactic categories may be helpful at the earliest stages of language learning, even
though it is ultimately a poor predictor of natural language.
What kind of input is responsible for the transition from linear to hierarchical
grammars? The smallest three corpora contain very few elements generated from
recursive productions (e.g., nested prepositional phrases or relative clauses) or sen-
tences using the same kind of phrase in diﬀerent positions (e.g., a prepositional phrase
modifying an NP subject, an NP object, a verb, or an adjective phrase). While a
regular grammar must often add an entire new subset of productions to account for
these elements, a context-free grammar need add fewer (especially CFG-S). As a con-
sequence, the ﬂat and regular grammars have poorer generalization ability and must
add proportionally more productions in order to parse a novel sentence.
The larger context-free grammar CFG-L outperforms CFG-S on the full corpus,
probably because it includes non-recursive counterparts to some of its recursive pro-
ductions. This results in a signiﬁcantly higher likelihood since less of the probability
mass is invested in recursive productions that are used much less frequently than the
non-recursive ones. Thus, although both grammars have similar expressive power,
the CFG-L is favored on larger corpora because the likelihood advantage overwhelms
the disadvantage in the prior.

regular and context-free possibilities. Each point represents one grammar; the x-axis
is meaningless.
Local search from hand-designed grammars
To what extent are these results dependent on these particular hand-designed gram-
mars? I address this question by analyzing the posterior scores of those grammars
identiﬁed via local search. Figure 3-5 depicts the posterior probabilities of all of the
grammars considered in the search. Many linear grammars found by the automatic
search procedures have scores similar to the best hand-designed linear grammars, but
none have posterior probabilities close to that of the best context-free grammars.
The posterior probabilities of the best grammars of each type found after the local
search are shown in Table 3.3. The results are qualitatively similar to those obtained
with hand-designed grammars: the posterior still favors a context-free grammar once
the corpus is large enough, but for smaller corpora the best grammars are linear.
Identifying a regular grammar by automated search
In addition to identifying the best grammars resulting from a local search, I also
examine the best regular grammar (REG-AUTO) found in a purely automated fashion
using the unsupervised learning model developed by Goldwater and Griﬃths (2007).
The grammars with the highest posterior probability on each corpus are shown in
Table 3.4.
All of the REG-AUTO grammars have posterior probabilities similar

to those of the other regular grammars, but on the larger corpora none have higher
probability than the best context-free grammars. Because the REG-AUTO grammars
do not consistently have higher probability than the other regular grammars, we
cannot conclude that they represent the “true best” from the space of all possible
grammars of that type. However, the fact that the best regular grammars found by
every method have a similar order-of-magnitude probability – and that none have
been found that approach the best-performing context-free grammar – suggests that
if better regular grammars do exist, they are not easy to discover.
Summing up these results, we ﬁnd that a context-free grammar always has the
highest posterior probability on the largest corpus, compared to a variety of plausible
linear grammars. Though the ability of the hierarchical grammars to generate a higher
variety of sentences from fewer productions typically results in a lower likelihood, this
compression helps dramatically in the prior. A hierarchical grammar thus consistently
maximizes the tradeoﬀbetween data ﬁt and complexity.
Ungrammatical sentences
One decision made in constructing the corpus was to remove the ungrammatical
sentences. This decision was primarily a pragmatic one, but I believe it is justiﬁed for
several reasons. A child learning a language might be able to identify at least some
of the ungrammatical sentences as such, based on pragmatic signals or on portions
of the grammar learned so far. Also, if learners disregard sentence forms that occur
very rarely, this would minimize the problem posed by ungrammatical sentences:
they would be able to ignore the majority of ungrammatical sentences, but relatively
few grammatical ones. Finally, since the hierarchical grammar type is preferred on
corpora as small as Level 4 and no ungrammatical sentences occurred 10 times or
more, it seemed unlikely that including ungrammatical sentences would alter the
main ﬁndings.
Nevertheless, it is still useful to compare each of the grammars on the corpus that
includes ungrammatical sentences in order to be certain that the decision to exclude

them is not critical to the outcome.13 To the best grammars of each type, I added
the minimum number of additional productions required to parse the ungrammatical
corpus. The hierarchical grammars still have the highest posterior probability (Level 6
posterior: CFG-L: -29963; REG-B: -30458; REG-M: -30725; CFG-S: -31008; REG-N:
-33466; 1-ST: -43098; FLAT: -92737). Thus, considering the ungrammatical sentences
along with the grammatical sentences does not qualitatively alter these ﬁndings.
Sentence tokens vs sentence types
The likelihood was deﬁned under a language model with separate generative processes:
one for the allowable types of syntactic forms in a language, another for the frequency
of speciﬁc sentence tokens. This deﬁnition eﬀectively restricts the data considered
by the model to only include sentence types, rather than each individual sentence
token. Deﬁning the likelihood in this way was a principled choice, paralleling standard
linguistic practice, in which grammars are evaluated based on how well they account
for which sentences occur, rather than their frequency distribution. It is nevertheless
useful to explore precisely what the eﬀect of making this choice is.
Interestingly, the linear grammars were overwhelmingly preferred over the hier-
archical grammars on the corpus of sentence tokens (Level 6 posterior: REG-N: -
135704; REG-M: -136965; REG-B: -136389; CFG-L: -145729; CFG-S: -148792; FLAT:
-188403; 1-ST: -212551). As before, the context-free grammars had higher prior prob-
ability – but unlike before, the linear grammars’ goodness-of-ﬁt outweighed the pref-
erence for simplicity. Why? The corpus of sentence tokens contains almost ten times
as much data, but no concomitant increase in the variety of sentences (as would occur
if there were simply more types, corresponding to a larger dataset of tokens). As a re-
sult, the likelihood term is weighted much more highly, thus more strongly penalizing
the hierarchical grammars (which overgeneralize more).
This result suggests that if the hierarchical structure of syntax is to be inferred
from observed data based on Bayesian inference with probabilistic grammars, the

learner must have some sort of disposition to evaluate grammars primarily with re-
spect to type-based rather than token-based data. Although one possibility is that
this disposition emerges from a general insensitivity to token frequencies, we certainly
do not suggest that this is the case: there is extensive psycholinguistic and develop-
mental evidence demonstrating that people are sensitive to quantitative frequency
variations in a wide variety of contexts. It is more plausible that grammar induction
per se is based on more sophisticated grammar models (like the adaptor framework)
which do not treat each sentence as an independent statistical sample from the gram-
mar. In such a framework, quantitative variation in token frequencies is not ignored,
but is separated from the component of the representation that captures the deep
principles of the grammar that generate acceptable forms. We will return to this
issue in the discussion.
Age-based stratiﬁcation
These results may have developmental implications, but these must be interpreted
with caution. The ﬁndings do not necessarily imply that children should go through
a period of using a simpler ﬂat or one-state grammar, just because those grammar
types were found to do best on the smaller type-based corpora. The Levels corpora are
based on divisions by sentence frequency rather than by age. Though it is plausible
that children can parse the simpler and more common sentences before the longer,
rarer ones, it is certainly not the case that they acquire an understanding of language
sentence by sentence, fully understanding some sentences and not at all understanding
everything else. Thus, the diﬀerent Levels corpora probably do not directly correspond
to the amount of input available to the children at various ages. Instead, the division
into Levels allows for an exploration of the tradeoﬀbetween complexity and data ﬁt
as the quantity of evidence increases.
It is nevertheless worthwhile to estimate, at least approximately, how soon that
evidence is available to children. I therefore compare the posterior probabilities of the
grammars on the Epoch corpora, which were constructed creating age-based divisions
in the full corpus. Table 3.5 shows the probabilities of the best hand-designed linear
101

and hierarchical grammars on these corpora. Strikingly, a context-free grammar is
preferred at every age. This is even true for grammars that correspond to just the
ﬁrst ﬁle (Epoch 0), which consists of one hour of conversation at age 2;3. It is also
interesting that the prior probabilities of the CFG-S and CFG-L grammars beginning
at Epoch 3 do not change.
Why is this?
Recall that at each epoch and level, I
evaluate only the subset of each grammar necessary to parse the sentences observed in
the corresponding corpus (removing any unnecessary productions). The fact that the
CFGs stabilize by Epoch 3 suggests that only 60% of the corpus is necessary to support
the same grammars that are also preferred for the entire corpus. This is a consequence
of the powerful generalization capacity that comes from using a CFG. In contrast,
regular grammars generalize less appropriately: the best regular grammar must be
supplemented with additional productions at every additional epoch, resulting in a
prior probability that continues to change as the corpus grows.
Do these results indicate that English-speaking children, if they are rational learn-
ers, can conclude after only a few hours of conversation that language has hierarchical
phrase structure? No. In order to draw such a conclusion the child would minimally
need to assign each word to its correct syntactic category and also be able to remember
and parse somewhat complex utterances – capacities which are taken for granted in
this model. However, this analysis does show that the data supporting a hierarchical
phrase structure for English are so ubiquitous that once a learner has some ability to
assign syntactic categories to words and to parse sentences of suﬃcient complexity, it
should be possible to infer that hierarchical grammars provide the best description of
the language’s syntax. It is interesting and theoretically important that the amount
of data required to infer the existence of hierarchical phrase structure is much less
than is required to infer all the rules of the correct hierarchical phrase-structure gram-
mar. In terms of Figures 3-1 and 3-2, an ideal learner can infer the correct hypothesis
at the higher level of abstraction T from less data than is required for inferring the
correct hypothesis at a lower level, G. Although I have not demonstrated this here, it
is theoretically possible that during the course of acquisition, higher-level knowledge,

once learned, may usefully constrain predictions about unseen data. It might also
eﬀectively act in ways that are hard to distinguish from innate knowledge or innate
constraints, given that it can be learned from such little data. I will return to this
point in the discussion.
Generalizability
Though posterior probability penalizes overgeneralization via the likelihood, it is im-
portant for a natural language learner to be able to generalize beyond the input
observed, to be able to parse and comprehend novel sentences. How well do the dif-
ferent grammars predict unseen sentences? One measure of this is the percentage of
the full (Level 6) corpus that can be parsed by the best grammars learned for subsets
(Level 1 to 5) of the full corpus. If a grammar learned from a smaller corpus can parse
sentence types in the full corpus that do not exist in its subset, it has generalized
beyond the input it received and generalized in a correct fashion. Table 3.6 shows the
percentage of sentence types and tokens in the full Level 6 corpus that can be parsed
by each of the best grammars for the smaller Levels. The context-free grammars
usually generalize the most, followed by the regular grammars. The ﬂat grammar
does not generalize at all: at each level it can only parse the sentences it has direct
experience of. The one-state grammar can generalize to 100% of sentence types and
tokens at every level because it can generalize to 100% of all sentences, grammatical
or not.
A more stringent test of generalization is to evaluate it with respect to completely
novel corpora. To that end, we selected the ﬁnal ﬁle of the Sarah corpus (Brown,
1973) of the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000); we chose this because, since
Sarah was 5;1 at the time, this presented a more stringent test of generalization than
if she were younger. Processing the corpus in the same way as the Adam corpus (i.e.,
replacing lexical items with syntactic categories and removing the more complex
sentence types) results in a dataset with 156 sentence types corresponding to 230
sentence tokens. The Level 6 CFG-L parses the highest percentage of sentence types
in that corpus (94.2%), followed closely by CFG-S (93.6%), with REG-M (91.7%),

REG-B (91.0%), and REG-N (87.2%) trailing.
Although the magnitude of these
diﬀerences is not large, they once again follow the same pattern as that noted on the
Adam corpus.
Do the context-free grammars simply generalize more than the regular gram-
mars, or do they generalize in the right way? In other words, would the context-free
grammars also recognize and parse more ungrammatical English sentences than the
regular grammars? Of the 191 ungrammatical sentence types excluded from the full
Adam corpus, the REG-B parses the most (107), followed by CFG-L (84), CFG-S
(73), REG-M (72), and REG-N (57). Aside from the ﬂat grammar, all of the gram-
mars make some incorrect overgeneralizations. This should not be surprising given
that these grammars lack the expressivity needed to encode important syntactic con-
straints, such as agreement. However, it is interesting that the REG-M grammar,
which generalizes less than either context-free grammar to the full corpus in Table
3.6, generalizes to the ungrammatical sentences similarly to CFG-S: to the extent that
REG-M grammar generalizes, it does so more often in the wrong way by making more
incorrect overgeneralizations. This is even more striking in the case of the REG-B
grammar, which parses somewhat fewer correct sentences (in the full corpus) than
105

either context-free grammar, but parses more incorrect (ungrammatical) sentences
than the others.
The hierarchical grammars also generalize more appropriately than the linear
grammars in the speciﬁc case of auxiliary-fronting for interrogative sentences. As
Table 3.7 shows, both context-free grammars can parse aux-fronted interrogatives
containing subject NPs that have relative clauses with auxiliaries – Chomsky’s critical
forms – despite never having seen an example of these forms in the input. They can
do so because the input does contain simple declaratives and interrogatives, which
license interrogative productions that do not contain an auxiliary in the main clause.
The input also contains relative clauses, which are parsed as part of the noun phrase
using the production [NP →NP CP]. Both context-free grammars can therefore parse
an interrogative with a subject NP containing a relative clause, despite never having
seen that form in the input.
Unlike the context-free grammars, neither regular grammar can correctly parse
complex aux-fronted interrogatives. The larger regular grammar REG-N cannot be-
cause, although its NPCP productions can parse a relative clause in an NP, it does
not have productions that can parse input in which a verb phrase without a main
clause auxiliary follows an NPCP production. This is because there was no input in
which such a verb phrase did occur, so the only NPCP productions occur either at
the end of a sentence in the object NP, or followed by a normal verb phrase. Com-
plex interrogative sentences – exactly the input that Chomsky argued are necessary
– would be required to drive this grammar to the correct generalization.
The other regular grammars, REG-M and REG-B, cannot parse complex interrog-
atives for a diﬀerent reason. Because they do not create a separate non-terminal like
NPCP for NPs containing relative clauses, they do have productions that can parse
input in which such a subject NP is followed by a verb phrase without a main clause
auxiliary. However, since they do not represent phrases as phrases, successful parsing
of the complex interrogative “Can eagles that are alive ﬂy?” (aux n comp aux adj vi)
would require that the sentence have an expansion in which the non-terminal adj is
followed by a vi. Because no sentences in the input follow this pattern, the grammars

cannot parse it, and therefore cannot parse the complex interrogative sentence in
which it occurs.
One might argue that because none of these grammars can parse the incorrect
complex interrogative (e.g., “Are eagles that alive can ﬂy?”), we have not engaged
with the precise original argument. Although we do not seek to address the issue
of structure dependence, which this question more directly bears on, it is nonethe-
less useful to compare the performance of these grammars to the same grammars
containing the minimal number of additional productions necessary to parse such
a sentence. When we add these productions to the grammars (whether regular or
context-free), they are not used to parse any of the sentences in the full corpus, and
the inside-outside algorithm automatically prunes them away. If it is forced not to,
the resulting grammars have lower prior probability (due to the additional produc-
tions) as well as lower likelihood (due to predicting sentences not found in the corpus),
and thus will be dispreferred to similar grammars that lack those productions.
The superior generalization ability of the hierarchical grammars, though it hurts
their likelihood scores, is of critical importance. Chomsky’s original suggestion that
linear rules might be taken as more natural accounts of the data may have rested on
the intuition that a grammar that sticks as closely as possible to the observed data is
simpler without any a priori biases to the contrary. Such grammars do indeed predict
the data better; they receive higher likelihood than the hierarchical grammars, which
overgeneralize and thus waste some probability mass on sentence types that are never
observed. However, a grammar that overgeneralizes – not too far, and just in the
right ways – is necessary in order to parse the potentially inﬁnite number of novel
sentences faced by a learner of natural language. Of all the grammars explored, only
the hierarchical grammars generalize in the same way humans do. While in a sense
this should not be a surprise, it is noteworthy that a rational learner given child-
directed language input prefers these grammars over those that do not generalize
appropriately, without direct evidence pointing either way.
108

Discussion
This model of language suggests that there may be suﬃcient evidence in the input for
an ideal rational learner to conclude that language has hierarchical phrase structure
without having an innate language-speciﬁc bias to do so. The best-performing gram-
mars correctly form interrogatives by fronting the main clause auxiliary, even though
the input contains none of the crucial data Chomsky identiﬁed. In this discussion,
I consider the implications of these results for more general questions of innateness,
and for the nature of language acquisition in human children.
The question of innateness
In debates about innateness, there are often tradeoﬀs between the power of the learn-
ing mechanism, the expressive potential of the representation, and the amount of
built-in domain-speciﬁc knowledge. This modelling framework enables us to make
assumptions about each of these factors explicit, and thereby analyze whether these
assumptions are fair as well as to what extent the conclusions depend upon them. The
issue is also more complicated than is captured by making the distinction between
representational structure and the nature of the cognitive biases necessary. There
is the additional question of which of the many capacities underlying successful lan-
guage use are innate, as well as to what extent each capacity is domain-general or
domain-speciﬁc. The argument I consider here is concerned with whether a particular
feature of linguistic syntax – hierarchical structure – must be innately speciﬁed as
part of a language-speciﬁc learning module in children’s minds. This analysis incor-
porates several assumptions about the cognitive resources available to children, but
these resources are plausibly domain-general.
Probably the strongest assumption in the analysis is a powerful learning mech-
anism. I assume both that the learner can eﬀectively search over the space of all
possible grammars to arrive at optimal or near-optimal hypotheses, and that the
grammars I have analyzed are suﬃciently close to the optimal ones. Advances in
computational linguistics and the development of more powerful models of unsuper-
109

vised grammar induction will do much to address the latter assumption, and until
then, these conclusions are of necessity preliminary. In the meantime, we can have
some conﬁdence based on the fact that every linear grammar I was able to construct
through various and exhaustive means performed less well than the best hierarchical
grammars I found. Moreover, the poor performance of linear grammars appears to
occur for a principled reason: they require more productions in order to match the
degree of ﬁt attained by context-free grammars, and therefore fail to maximize the
complexity-ﬁt tradeoﬀ.
Even if this approach succeeds in identifying (near-)optimal grammars, the as-
sumption that child learners can eﬀectively search the space of all possible grammars
is a strong one. Especially for context-free grammars, where the space is much larger
than for regular grammars, it may be that learners will need some built-in biases in
order to search eﬀectively (Kearns & Valiant, 1989). In general, one must assume
either a powerful domain-general learning mechanism with only a few general innate
biases that guide the search, or a weaker learning mechanism with stronger innate
biases, or some compromise position. These results do not suggest that any of these
possibilities is more likely than the others. The core argument concerns only the spe-
ciﬁc need for a bias to a priori prefer analyses of syntax that incorporate hierarchical
phrase structure. I am arguing that a rational learner may not require such a bias,
not that other biases are also unnecessary.
In addition to assumptions about the learning mechanism, this model incorporates
some assumptions about the representational abilities of the child.
First of all, I
assume that children have the (domain-general) capacity to represent various types
of grammars, including both hierarchical and linear grammars. I am not claiming
that the speciﬁc grammars I analyze are exactly the ones children represent; clearly
all of the grammars I have worked with are oversimpliﬁed in many ways. But an
assumption that children in some sense have the capacity to represent both linear
and hierarchical patterns of sequential structures – linguistic or non-linguistic – is
necessary to even ask the questions I consider here. If children were not born with
the capacity to represent the thoughts they later grow to have, no learning in that
110

direction could possibly occur. This analysis also assumes that the learner represents
the diﬀerent grammar types as diﬀerent grammar types, choosing between context-
free, regular, ﬂat, and one-state grammars. This stratiﬁcation is not critical to the
results, however. If anything, it is a conservative assumption, because it favors the
non-hierarchical grammars more heavily than they would be favored if I treated all
grammars as instances of a single general type.14
Perhaps the most basic representational assumption is that learners are evaluating
grammars with explicit symbolic structure. Although this assumption is not particu-
larly controversial in linguistics, it has been expressly denied in other recent analyses
of PoS arguments by cognitive modelers (e.g., Lewis & Elman, 2001; Reali & Chris-
tiansen, 2005). I am not arguing that the assumption of explicit structure is the only
viable route to understanding language acquisition as a kind of inductive learning.
It is important and useful to explore the alternative possibility that generalizations
about grammatical structure are not innate because such structure either does not
exist at all or is present only implicitly in some kind of sub-symbolic representation.
But it is also important to consider the possibility that these generalizations about
grammatical structure exist explicitly and can still be learned. One motivation is
simply thoroughness: any possibility that cannot be ruled out on a priori grounds
should be investigated. Another reason is that the reality of linguistic structure is
widely accepted in standard linguistics. There are many linguistic phenomena whose
only satisfying explanations (to date, not in principle) have been framed in struc-
tured symbolic terms. Explicitly structured representations also provide the basis of
most state-of-the-art approaches in computational linguistics (e.g., Charniak, 1993;
Manning & Sch¨utze, 1999; Collins, 1999; Eisner, 2002; Klein & Manning, 2004).
Given how useful structured grammatical representations have been both for explain-
ing linguistic phenomena and behavior and for building eﬀective computer systems
for natural language processing, it seems worthwhile to take seriously the possibility
that they might be the substrate over which children represent and learn language.
A ﬁnal set of assumptions concerns the way I represent the input to learning. I

have given the model a corpus consisting of sequences of syntactic categories, corre-
sponding to types of sentences, rather than sequences of lexical items which would
correspond to actual sentence tokens.15 There are two assumptions here: ﬁrst, that
it is reasonable to use syntactic categories rather than individual lexical items, and
second, that it is reasonable to use input consisting of sentence types rather than
sentence tokens.
Both of these assumptions are not necessary in principle, but they greatly simplify
the analysis. Working with syntactic categories rather than individual lexical items
allows us to focus on learning grammars from the syntactic-category data they imme-
diately generate rather than having to infer this intermediate layer of representation
from raw sequences of individual words. I make no claims about how children might
initially acquire these syntactic categories, and the analysis would not change if they
themselves were shown to be innate (whatever that would mean). There is some
evidence that aspects of this knowledge may be in place even in children below the
age of two (Booth & Waxman, 2003), and that syntactic categories may be learnable
from simple distributional information without reference to the underlying grammar
(Sch¨utze, 1995; Redington et al., 1998; Mintz, Newport, & Bever, 2002; Gerken et al.,
2005; Griﬃths, Steyvers, Blei, & Tenenbaum, 2005). Thus I think it is plausible to
assume that children have access to something like the input I have used here as they
approach problems of grammar acquisition. However, it would still be desirable for
future work to move beyond the assumption of given syntactic categories. It is pos-
sible that the best linear grammars might use entirely diﬀerent syntactic categories
than those I assumed here.
It would be valuable to explore whether hierarchical
grammars continue to score better than linear grammars if the input to learning con-
sists of automatically labelled part-of-speech tags rather than hand-labelled syntactic
categories.
15Tomasello (2000) and others suggest that children initially restrict their syntactic frames to be
used with particular verbs (the so-called “verb island” hypothesis). This model treats all members
of a given syntactic category the same, and therefore does not capture this hypothesis. However, this
aspect of the model reﬂects a merely pragmatic decision based on ease of computation. An extension
of the model that took lexical items rather than syntactic categories as input could incorporate
interesting item-speciﬁc dependencies.
112

Evaluating simple probabilistic grammars on sentence types rather than sentence
tokens is an approximation to using more sophisticated multi-stage probabilistic gram-
mars such as adaptor grammars (e.g., Goldwater et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2007),
which better capture the observed power-law frequencies of natural language and the
processes giving rise to those frequencies. Presenting the model with sentence types
does not mean I am presuming that human learners ignore token frequencies; in fact,
the adaptor grammar framework explicitly provides a way to capture token-based
frequency information, and does so more accurately than conventional probabilistic
grammars do.
Do children actually evaluate candidate grammars primarily in terms of observed
sentence types rather than tokens? There is little empirical work that bears directly
on this issue, but the possibility is at least not inconsistent with what we know of
language acquisition. It derives from a sensible model of language, which separates
the component of the language faculty used to generate legal syntactic forms from the
component of the faculty that determines the distribution of sentences. This separa-
tion is reasonable because there are many factors that might aﬀect which sentences
are spoken that have nothing to do with the grammar itself: the conversational con-
text, lexical and syntactic priming eﬀects, and salience in memory, to name just a few.
A sensible learner should want to distinguish between these factors when evaluating
potential grammars, or at least try to remove some of the variation that is due to
language usage eﬀects rather than the intrinsic structure of the grammar.
If people do have a disposition to evaluate grammars on the basis of sentence types,
does this constitute a language-speciﬁc or domain-general disposition? It is diﬃcult
to say, but the conceptual underpinnings of the adaptor grammar framework are
consistent with a domain-general interpretation, emerging due to memory constraints
or other cognitive factors. Determining whether such a disposition exists – and, if so,
whether it is language-speciﬁc or not – is a question for future work.
It is important to note that the main claim, that the hierarchical phrase structure
of language need not be speciﬁed as part of the language faculty, is supported by the
ﬁnding that the model prefers the hierarchical grammars on the basis of type-based
113

input. As noted earlier, as long as there is some reasonable way to set it up such that
the ideal learner learns the right thing, that shows it is learnable; this argument is
even more powerful when the framework adopted, based on adaptor grammars, is if
anything a more accurate statistical model of natural language.
While the preference for linear grammars given token-based input does not aﬀect
my positive conclusion about hierarchical learnability with context-free grammars, it
does provide further motivation to explore more linguistically sophisticated hierar-
chically structured grammars that move beyond a simple context-free formalism. It
is known that CFGs are not adequate to capture the full syntax of language. It is
possible that if one worked with more sophisticated, linguistically powerful hierar-
chical grammars, they might provide better ﬁts to sentence token data. This work
also yields predictions that might be testable experimentally: for instance, one could
evaluate whether people learn a diﬀerent grammar in an artiﬁcial language learning
experiment based on whether the evaluate the data with respect to type or token-
based information.
In any case, all of the assumptions made in this analysis involve either abilities
that are plausibly domain-general, or language-speciﬁc knowledge that is distinct
from the knowledge being debated: I critically did not assume that learners must
know in advance that language speciﬁcally has hierarchical phrase structure. Rather,
I showed that this knowledge can be acquired by an ideal learner equipped with
sophisticated domain-general statistical inference mechanisms and a domain-general
ability to represent hierarchical structure in sequences – a type of structure found in
many domains outside of natural language. The model contains no a priori bias to
prefer hierarchical grammars in language – a bias that classic PoS arguments have
argued was necessary.
The learned preference for hierarchical grammars is data-
driven, and diﬀerent data could have resulted in a diﬀerent outcome. Indeed, we ﬁnd
diﬀerent outcomes when we restrict attention to only part of the data.
114

Relevance to human language acquisition
What conclusions, if any, may we draw from this work about the nature of grammat-
ical acquisition in human learners? This analysis focuses on an ideal learner, in the
spirit of Marr’s level of computational theory. Just as Chomsky’s original argument
focused on what was in principle impossible for humans to learn without some innate
knowledge, this response looks at what is in principle possible. While this ideal learn-
ing analysis helps recalibrate the bounds of what is possible, it may not necessarily
describe the actual learning processes of human children.
One concern is that it is unclear to what extent humans actually approximate
rational learners. Chomsky himself appealed to the notion of an objective neutral
scientist studying the structure of natural language, who rationally should ﬁrst con-
sider the linear rule for auxiliary-fronting because it is a priori less complex (Chomsky,
1971). Although there is some debate about how best to formalize rational scientiﬁc
inference, Bayesian approaches oﬀer what is arguably the most promising general ap-
proach (Jaynes, 2003; Howson & Urbach, 1993). A more deductive or falsiﬁcationist
approach (Popper, 1959) to scientiﬁc inference might underlie Chomsky’s view: an
objective neutral scientist should maintain belief in the simplest rule – e.g., the lin-
ear rule for auxiliary-fronting – until counterevidence is observed, and because such
counterevidence is never observed in the auxiliary-fronting case, that scientist would
incorrectly stay with the linear rule. But under the view that scientiﬁc discovery is a
kind of inference to the best explanation – which is naturally captured in a Bayesian
framework such as ours – the hierarchical rule could be preferred even without direct
counterevidence eliminating the simpler alternative. This is particularly true when
we consider the discovery problem as learning the grammar of a language as a whole,
where the rules for parsing a particular kind of sentence (such as complex auxiliary-
fronted interrogatives) may emerge as a byproduct of learning how to parse many
other kinds of sentences. The rational Bayesian learning framework adopted here
certainly bears more resemblance to the practice of actual linguists – who after all
are mostly convinced that language does indeed have hierarchical structure! – than
115

does a falsiﬁcationist neutral scientist.
Deﬁning the prior probability unavoidably requires making particular assump-
tions. A simplicity metric deﬁned over a very diﬀerent representation would probably
yield diﬀerent results, but this does not pose a problem for this analysis. The classic
PoS argument claims that it would be impossible for a reasonable learner to learn
a hierarchical rule like aux-fronting. All that is required to respond to such a claim
is to demonstrate that such a reasonable learner could learn this. Indeed, this prior
is reasonable: consistent with intuition, it assigns higher probability to shorter and
simpler grammars, and it is deﬁned over a sensible space of grammars that is capable
of representing linguistically realistic abstractions like noun and verb phrases. Even
if a radically diﬀerent simplicity metric were to yield diﬀerent results, this would not
change the conclusion that some reasonable learner could learn that language has
hierarchical phrase structure.
Another issue for cognitive plausibility is the question of scalability: the largest
corpus presented to the model contains only 2336 sentence types, many less than
the average human learner is exposed to in a lifetime. Since these results are driven
by the simplicity advantage of the context-free grammars (as reﬂected in their prior
probabilities), it might be possible that increasing quantities of data would eventually
drown out this advantage in favor of advantages in the likelihood. I think this is
unlikely for two reasons. First, the number of sentence types grows far less rapidly
than the number of distinct sentence tokens, and the likelihoods in the analysis are
deﬁned over the former rather than the latter. Secondly, as I have shown, additional
(grammatical) sentence types are more likely to be already parsable by a context-free
grammar than by a regular grammar. This means that the appearance of those types
will actually improve the relative likelihood of the context-free grammar (because
they will no longer constitute an overgeneralization) while not changing the prior
probability at all; by contrast, the regular grammar may more often need to add
productions in order to account for an additional sentence type, resulting in a lower
prior probability and thus a lower relative posterior score.
If the knowledge that language has hierarchical phrase structure is not in fact
116

innate, why do all known human languages appear to have hierarchical phrase struc-
ture? This is a good question, and I can only oﬀer speculation here. One answer is
that nothing in this analysis precludes the possibility that children have a cognitive
bias towards syntactic systems organized around hierarchical phrase structures: the
point is that the classic PoS argument may not be a good reason to believe that
they do, or that the bias need be speciﬁcally linguistic. Another answer is that even
if a rational learner could in principle infer hierarchical structure from typical data,
that does not mean that actual children necessarily do so: such knowledge might
still be innate in some way, either language-speciﬁcally or emergent from cognitive,
memory-based, or perceptual biases. For instance, if human thoughts are fundamen-
tally structured in a hierarchical fashion, and if children have an initial bias to treat
syntax as a system of rules for mapping between thoughts and sequences of sounds,
then this could eﬀectively amount to an implicit bias for hierarchical structure in
syntax. In fact, the ﬁnding that hierarchical phrase structure is only preferred for
corpora of sentence types (rather than tokens) may suggest that a bias to attend to
types is necessary to explain children’s acquisition patterns. It is also still possible
that there are no biases in this direction at all – cognitive or otherwise – in which
case one might expect to see languages without hierarchical phrase structure. There
have recently been claims to that eﬀect (e.g., Everett, 2005), although much work
remains to verify them.
Although Chomsky’s original formulation of the PoS argument focused on the
innateness of the hierarchical structure of language, recent characterizations of an
innate language faculty have concentrated on recursion in particular (Hauser, Chom-
sky, & Fitch, 2002). An interesting aspect of these results is that although all of
the best context-free grammars I found contained recursive productions, the model
prefers grammars (CFG-L) that also contain non-recursive counterparts for complex
NPs (noun phrases with embedded relative clauses).16 It is diﬃcult to know how to
interpret these results, but one possibility is that perhaps syntax, while fundamentally
16See Perfors, Tenenbaum, Gibson, and Regier (submitted) for a more detailed exploration of this
issue.
117

recursive, could also usefully employ non-recursive rules to parse simpler sentences
that recursive productions could parse in principle. These non-recursive productions
do not alter the range of sentence types the grammar can parse, but they are useful
in more precisely matching the linguistic input. In general, this paradigm provides
a method for the quantitative treatment of recursion and other contemporary ques-
tions about the innate core of language. Using it, we can address questions about
how much recursion an optimal grammar for a language should have, and where it
should have it.
Conclusion
I have demonstrated that an ideal learner equipped with the resources to represent a
range of symbolic grammars that diﬀer qualitatively in structure, as well as the abil-
ity to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting grammars of various types according to a Bayesian score,
can in principle infer the appropriateness of hierarchical phrase-structure grammars
without the need for innate language-speciﬁc biases to that eﬀect. If an ideal learner
can make this inference from actual child-directed speech, it may be possible for hu-
man children to do so as well. Two important open questions remain: how well an
ideal learnability analysis corresponds to the actual learning behavior of children, and
how well this computational model approximates this ideal. These speciﬁc conclu-
sions are therefore preliminary and may need to be revised as we begin to learn more
about these two fundamental issues. Regardless, I have oﬀered a positive and plausi-
ble “in principle” response to the classic negative “in principle” poverty-of-stimulus
arguments for innate language-speciﬁc knowledge.
This work also suggests a new approach to classic questions of innateness. By
working with sophisticated statistical inference mechanisms that can operate over
structured representations of knowledge such as generative grammars, we can rigor-
ously explore a relatively uncharted region of the theoretical landscape: the possibility
that genuinely structured knowledge is genuinely learned, as opposed to the classic
positions that focus on innate structured knowledge or learned unstructured knowl-
118

edge, where apparent structure is merely implicit.
Some general lessons can be drawn. It does not make sense to ask whether a
speciﬁc generalization is based on innate knowledge when that generalization is part
of a much larger system of knowledge that is acquired as a whole. Abstract organiza-
tional principles can be induced based on evidence from one part of the system and
eﬀectively transferred to constrain learning of other parts of the system, as we saw
for the auxiliary-fronting rule. These principles may also be learned prior to more
concrete generalizations, or may be learnable from much less data than is required to
identify most of the speciﬁc rules in a complex system of knowledge. In the following
two chapters, I will explore two other topics within language acquisition – learning
verb argument constructions, and acquiring word learning biases – in an eﬀort to
evaluate whether, and to what extent, these lessons apply more generally.

Chapter 4
Word learning principles
In Chapter 1 I discussed the problem of Feature Relevance, with an emphasis on its
implications for the problems of word learning and the determination of reference.
We saw that it may be reasonable to assume that the problem of Feature Relevance
can be addressed, at least in part, by assuming the existence of some innate higher-
order learning constraint (or overhypothesis), but that this solution cannot apply
everywhere. In some domains, overhypotheses themselves appear to be learned, as
is plausibly true for the case of the shape bias in word learning. However, we still
understand little about how learning on multiple levels of abstraction can be done.
Does lower-level learning always occur before higher-level learning, as one might ex-
pect, or is it possible to acquire an overhypothesis faster the the speciﬁc hypotheses
it is meant to constrain? If not, how can we explain the emergence of the shape bias?
If so, what principles explain this acquisition? And what, if anything, does this imply
about the inductive constraints that were previously assumed must be innate?
The acquisition of feature biases
Although learning on multiple levels of abstraction is a theme throughout this thesis,
in this chapter I focus on it in more detail in the context of the acquisition of word

121

learning biases. This work addresses several major issues that arise in that literature.
Category learning
In previous work with Charles Kemp (Kemp et al., 2007), we demonstrated that
a simple hierarchical Bayesian model can qualitatively capture human performance
based on simple datasets modelled on Smith et al. (2002) and Jones and Smith (2002).
However, the input we gave to that model was far “cleaner” than that typically faced
by the child; it had relatively few features, and there was more within-category coher-
ence than might be typically found in the real world. Was the successful acquisition
of a shape bias the result of these factors? How “messy” would the input have to be
before second-order overhypothesis learning would be impossible?
Our previous work also assumed that the learner already knows which categories
individual items are in. The actual learning task faced by children is of course far
more complicated, since category information is not given directly: children must
realize that individual exemplars of basketballs and baseballs are both members of the
category ball, as well as that balls (like other count nouns) tend to be similar in shape
but not other features. How do children solve this learning problem? One answer is
that perhaps they are eﬀectively given category information via word labels: if they
believe that labels are clear indicators of category membership, they could use this
information to cluster items in the world into categories and thereby learn the shape
bias. A diﬀerent possibility is that children could learn the categories themselves,
without requiring labels, if they assume that categories consist of clusters of items
with coherent features.
As we saw in Chapter 1, a core debate about how the shape bias emerges focuses
on the nature of the higher-level assumptions necessary to explain that emergence:
is it due to attentional/associationist learning (Smith et al., 2003; Colunga & Smith,
2004), or does it result from certain ontological commitments children make concern-
ing the nature of kinds (Xu, 2002; Xu et al., 2004)? Central to this discussion is the
question of what assumptions children make about word labels. According to the
“dumb attentional mechanism” account, no special assumptions about words need
122

to be made in order to explain its emergence (Smith et al., 2003; Colunga & Smith,
2004, 2005; Smith & Samuelson, 2005). The shape bias is a bias about words, but
only in the sense that what is learned is the correlation between the structure of
early noun vocabularies and organization by shape. This correlation is argued to be
suﬃcient for an associative learner to acquire the second-order biases that children
do – biases saying that count nouns are correlated with shape, but in other domains
diﬀerent features are correlated with labels. Simulations on connectionist networks
qualitatively replicate the emergence of feature biases, given artiﬁcial input whose
statistics reﬂect that of the early noun vocabulary of children speaking English and
Japanese (Samuelson, 2002; Colunga & Smith, 2005).
Other researchers propose that the emergence of the shape bias cannot be fully
understood via simple associative mechanisms. Rather, as Waxman (2004) suggests,
“infants embark on the task of word learning not as tabulae rasae, but equipped with
a broad, universally shared expectation that links words to commonalities among
objects.” According to this idea, labels cannot be viewed simply as another feature
that varies coherently with features of objects in the world: instead, from birth,
children have an innate bias to believe that word labels pick out categories in a special
way (e.g.,
Soja et al., 1991; Xu, 1999, 2002). Even pre-linguistic infants appear
sensitive to information conveyed by language, individuating objects (Xu, 2002) and
forming object categories (Balaban & Waxman, 1996; Fulkerson & Waxman, 2007)
on the basis of linguistic labels but not other correlated information like tones.
These researchers agree that the statistical correlation between early noun vocab-
ularies and objects in the world plays some role in the shape bias in word learning,
but argue that one of the more crucial parts is that children have an a priori bias
to believe that words are privileged cues to categories. Under this view, the shape
bias is not speciﬁc to naming, but rather emerges because shape is a reliable cue to
category/kind membership, which itself is correlated strongly with naming (Bloom,
2000; Diesendruck & Bloom, 2003; Xu et al., 2004). Children show the shape bias
when asked to reason about categories, whether they are named or not (Diesendruck
& Bloom, 2003). In addition, word generalization patterns are argued to depend on
123

conceptual as well as perceptual knowledge: when novel target objects are described
as artifacts 18- to 24-month-olds extend names on the basis of shape, but when they
are described as animates, they use both shape and texture (Booth, Waxman, &
Huang, 2005; Booth & Waxman, 2006).
In sum, then, there remains much confusion about the role of linguistic input
in the emergence of higher-order feature biases. Do children presume that labels are
strong cues to category membership, or is the emergence of the shape bias explainable
without this assumption? The connectionist networks presented by Samuelson (2002)
and Colunga and Smith (2005) do not address this question, because there is no way
within those models to diﬀerentiate between words-as-categories, words-as-features,
and no words at all.
Learning from a few examples
An interesting study by Smith et al. (2002), often taken to be strong evidence for
the distributional account of the shape bias, provides strong evidence that it can be
taught. 17-month-old infants lacking the shape bias were trained for eight weeks on
two items from four novel categories with novel names (e.g., zup) that were strongly
organized by shape. At the end of this training, the infants’ ﬁrst-order and second-
order generalization was tested by presenting them with either an exemplar from one
of the trained categories (ﬁrst-order) or an exemplar from a novel category (second-
order) and asking them to choose another object that they think would share the same
label. In both cases, children preferred to extend the objects by shape, demonstrating
that they had acquired the shape bias at an age when non-trained children do not
have one. Most intriguingly, the children’s outside-of-the-lab vocabularies increased,
suggesting that the acquisition of the shape bias helped them to acquire English words
faster.
This is a surprising ﬁnding because aspects of it seem diﬃcult to explain under
either the distributional or the more nativist words-as-categories view. Although the
latter view may be consistent with a learning account that can explain how a few
additional items can lead to the emergence of this feature bias, no such account has
124

been articulated. Smith et al. (2002) interpret their results to be arguing for the
distributional account. However, although the ﬁnding supports the notion that the
shape bias is learned, it may be diﬃcult to explain how an associationist learner could
acquire it based on so little data. Associationist learning is generally much slower,
and less prone to rapid shifts based on few data points. The children in the study
already spoke many words; why did learning just a few more have such a large eﬀect?
Study 1: Category learning
In this section I present an extension of the model described in Kemp et al. (2007),
with the goal of exploring how ﬁrst-order learning (about categories) and second-
order learning (of feature biases) might emerge together. The model extension has
the ability to cluster individual items into categories as well as infer second-order
knowledge, or overhypotheses, about how categories in general are organized.
It
can also capture diﬀerent assumptions about the role of words. This permits us to
evaluate under what circumstances, if any, the diﬀerent assumptions would give rise
to diﬀerences in performance, at least in this ideal learning setting.
Previous work
In earlier work with Charles Kemp (Kemp et al., 2007), we presented a hierarchical
Bayesian model for the acquisition of feature biases. The basic model assumes that
data consists of observations of categories, where each observation corresponds to the
number of times the category is observed with each feature. For instance, one of the
datapoints corresponding to the model schema in Figure 4-1 would indicate that the
ball category occurs ﬁve times with the shape feature sphere.
Within the framework captured by this model, if we would like to predict what
sort of features we are liable to observe in some category n (i.e., level 1 knowledge
about features), the ﬁrst step is to ask how the level 1 knowledge might be acquired.
The answer to this question will make reference to a more abstract body of knowledge
(level 2 knowledge). In this case, level 2 knowledge would be knowledge about the
125

Figure 4-1: A hierarchical Bayesian model, Model L2.
Each setting of (α, β) is
an overhypothesis: β represents the feature distribution across all categories, and
α represents the variability of each feature within each category. Data consists of
category information corresponding to the features associated with each of the items
in the category – for instance, the individual exemplars of cats, cups, and balls shown
here. The hyper-parameters µ and λ are given; Level 1 and Level 2 knowledge are
inferred by the model.
distribution of features across categories in the world, which can be represented by
two parameters, α and β. Roughly speaking, α captures the extent to which each
individual category is organized by a given feature (or not), and β captures the
average distribution of features across all categories in the world. For instance, low
α would indicate that each item in a category tends to share a certain feature value,
but does not say anything about what value that might be: if a category had low α
for the shape feature, one would know that it was organized by shape, but not know
precisely what shape it was.
As one might expect, level 2 knowledge depends on knowledge at a higher level,
level 3, which is represented in this model by two (hyper-)parameters λ and µ. Be-
cause knowledge on higher levels grows increasingly abstract, it is diﬃcult to translate
level 3 prior knowledge in a clear and intuitive way – but, broadly speaking, λ and
µ capture prior assumptions about α and β, respectively.
The λ parameter cap-
tures something about the range of values expected about the uniformity of features
(would it be extremely unusual to see categories whose items all have exactly the
same shape?), and the µ parameter the range of values of the expected distribution
of features in the world.

In Kemp et al. (2007), we presented this model with data modelled after the
Smith et al. (2002) experiments. The data consisted of eight items divided into four
categories and is described in detail in Table 4.1. The model, which I will call Model
L2 because it performs inference on two levels of abstraction, forms correct ﬁrst- and
second-order generalizations on the basis of shape, as shown in Figure 4-2.

However, this data assumes the individual items are already partitioned into cat-

what the categories are, if it is simply given eight individual items, but with no
category information? Figure 4-3 shows the ﬁrst- and second-order predicted gener-
alization of Model L2 on this new input. It is apparent that if it is not given category
information, Model L2 cannot learn the shape bias. This is, of course, exactly what we
would expect, because the shape bias is a bias about what how features are organized
within categories; without categories, the idea is meaningless.

any bias.(a) First-order generalization. (b) Second-order generalization.
Extension A: Learning categories and overhypotheses
We cannot assume that children are necessarily shown how each individual item is
clustered into categories. Yet they clearly do learn the shape bias (and other sorts of
feature biases as well). How is this done? One possibility, as discussed earlier, would
be that the labels children hear serve as strong cues to category membership, and
that without labels they would be unable to form categories or make second-order
generalizations about them. The other possibility we considered is that the categories
could be learnable even without any associated word labels.1
I evaluate these possibilities by creating a category-learning extension of Model L2.
This extension is denoted with the preﬁx “C” (e.g., Model C-L2). Whereas Model L2
assumed that the input data corresponded to the features associated with categories
y (where yi contains the counts of features corresponding to category i), Model C-L2
assumes that the input consists of the features corresponding to individual items j.
It then tries to group the items j into the best categories yi. The model does not
know how many categories there are; rather, it calculates the best partition of items
into categories on the assumption that items with similar feature distributions are
1Of course, if a second-order bias were formed without any word information at all, it would not
be a bias about word learning per se, but rather about category organization. Nevertheless, since
this sort of bias has a clear relationship to the word learning biases we focus on in the literature, it
is an interesting question to explore – especially since, if a bias could be learned based simply on the
organization of coherent non-word features, it would not be diﬃcult to exploit the same mechanism
to handle additional word information.
128

more likely to be grouped together into a category. A prior favors smaller numbers
of categories, but this prior can be overcome if the items are diﬀerent enough from
one another. The technical details of this model are described in the appendix.
Presenting Model C-L2 the same data as in Table 4.1, but without category infor-
mation included, results in performance that is qualitatively quite diﬀerent to Model
L2 given the same data, and similar to that of Model L2 on input in which category
information is included. Figure 4-4 shows model performance for ﬁrst and second-
level generalization, as well as a depiction of the categories learned. The model is able
to group the individual items into categories based simply on feature coherence: the
shape features are more coherent than texture or color, and size, while coherent itself,
results in categories with overall more variation, so clustering by size is dispreferred.

input corresponding to the data from Smith et. al. (2002), but not pre-classiﬁed

categorization of the objects, forming four categories.
These results appear to suggest that knowing the categories may not be necessary
in order to acquire the shape bias, and in fact may not even make it much easier.
However, such a conclusion would be rather hasty. This input is much cleaner (in
terms of both the number and the coherence of features) than what is faced by children
learning natural language. Thus, even if knowing the categories in advance might not
be necessary when faced with this sort of input, it might still be necessary for a
more realistic situation. What we really need is an understanding in the abstract
of how knowing ﬁrst-order information about category assignments helps an ideal
learner make second-order generalizations about feature biases across categories. It is
129

unclear how much we can generalize results based on relatively small, clean datasets
to the complexity of the situation faced by the child learner in real life.
Extension B: A systematic exploration of category learning
One approach to this problem would be to present the model with realistic, child-
directed data, as we do in Chapters 3 and 5. But while it is possible to at least
approximate the sort of input children receive when the data in question is about
the syntactic forms they hear (thanks to the existence of corpora), it is a much
diﬀerent matter to know how to approximate the kind of data that would be relevant
here. How many items, and of what categories, does a typical child encounter in
his daily life? Even if we could roughly estimate this based on the ﬁrst words in
children’s vocabularies, what features do we assume those items have? Perhaps we
could estimate these by having adults list the features they associate with those items,
but – in addition to problems typical to feature-listing methodologies, like overlooking
extremely common or basic features (e.g., “breathes”, “has cells”) – doing so puts us
in danger of assuming precisely what we wish to study. If, as some have argued (e.g.,
Goldstone, Steyvers, Spencer-Smith, & Kersten, 2000; Smith, 2005), the process of
category learning aﬀects our perception of features, then adult ratings might not
accurately reﬂect children’s input at all.
Another option would be to evaluate how factors like category coherence or num-
ber of items and categories in a dataset of dataset aﬀect overhypothesis learning.
Previously the model was presented with datasets in which the categories were com-
pletely coherent with respect to shape: knowing the shape of an object served as a
100% valid predictor of which category that object was in. It may be that if categories
were less coherent, then knowing which items were in which categories would be more
useful for learning overhypotheses about how they are organized.
To test this, I create a series of datasets that vary systematically by coherence. As
before, there are eight objects from four categories, but the complexity of the dataset
is increased somewhat by adding additional features, ten of which are arbitrarily
called shape, and ten other. The other features always have 0% coherence, meaning

to make the diﬀerence between diﬀerent coherence levels most clear, these sample dataset
contain two categories of ﬁve items each. The actual sample datasets ﬁrst presented to the
model contain eight items corresponding to four categories; later we systematically vary the
number of items and categories between one and sixteen.

that they vary completely randomly with respect to category membership. The shape
features are generated by the following procedure. First, we set them to have feature
values that are 100% coherent with respect to the category, meaning they are perfect
predictors of category membership. A coherence level of c is generated according
to the deﬁnition that a feature value has a 100 −c% chance of being random. For
instance, if a feature (say, shape1) is 60% coherent, then each item in some category m
would, with 40% probability, have a shape1 that does not match the deﬁning shape1
of category m. To illustrate what is meant by coherence, sample data is shown in
Table 4.2.
I create datasets that vary systematically in the coherence of their shape features.
Dataset coherence ranges from 0% to 100% in increments of 20%. As before, second-
order generalization is tested with an additional object with novel values along each
feature: is the model more likely to assume that additional items in the same category
will share the same shape features, or the same other features?
At each level of coherence, I compare the generalization between datasets in which
the categories are given and datasets in which the model must infer the categories
itself. Figure 4-5(a) shows the results. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no signiﬁcant
131

diﬀerence in second-order generalization depending on whether the categories were
given to the model or not.
As Figure 4-5(b) reveals, if coherence is low enough
it does not support category learning; but it would not be suﬃcient to support a
second-order generalization even if the categories were known. In other words, once
the features are coherent enough to support second-order generalizations, they are
coherent enough to support categorization. Thus – at least for an optimal learner
– being given category information appears to make little diﬀerence as to whether
second-order overhypotheses are acquired.

in both cases; but if coherence is high enough to infer the existence of a feature bias,
it is high enough to infer category membership. (b) Category assignments inferred

coherence reaches 60%.
Although this is interesting, it is still somewhat unclear how much this result
depends on other aspects of the dataset, like the number of items or underlying
categories. I therefore systematically vary all possible combinations of the number
of items in the dataset (among 16, 8, 4, and 2 items) and the number of categories
(among 8, 4, 2, and 1). Results are shown in Figure 4-6. There is once again no
systematic diﬀerence in model performance depending on whether the categories are
given or not. If there is suﬃcient coherence to support overhypothesis learning, there
is suﬃcient coherence to support categorization. The other general patterns are all
sensible: second-order generalization is better if category coherence is higher or there
are more items in the dataset.

generalization by shape features, and the x axis depicts coherence varying from 0%
to 100%. As before, there is little systematic diﬀerence between second-order gener-
alization by whether the categories were given to the model or not.
If there is no systematic eﬀect of from making category information accessible, one
implication might be that the assumptions children make about words should have
no eﬀect either. Whether words are just another feature or a strong cue to category
membership, they carry more category information than was given to the model in
the “no categories” case, but it performed equally well regardless.
133

Extension C: The role of words
The simulations so far include two conditions, one in which no category information at
all is given and one in which category membership is known for all items. The latter
condition is equivalent to assuming that labels are perfectly indicative of category
membership and all items are labelled. To these two conditions, I add a condition in
which labels are simply additional features (and, again, all items are labelled). The
label information is there, but labels are not taken to be a strong indicator of category
membership; it is thus more consistent with the distributional learning account of the
shape bias.
Because it is unlikely that children hear labels for every item in their world, I
also add two conditions where only 50% of the items are labelled.2 I refer to these
conditions as semi-supervised, and there is a semi-supervised version corresponding
to each of the assumptions about words – whether words are taken as strong cues of
category membership, or whether they are simply features in the model.
Results are shown in Figure 4-7. As expected, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
model performance regardless of what assumptions were made about words, whether
all the items were labelled or only some were.

Is there any circumstance in which that the diﬀerent theories about the role of
words might result in diﬀerent predictions? One possibility could be be if words do
not correlate with the other features that pick out categories. Under the strongest
“words are cues to categories” claim, one should form categories based on the labels
even if the other features are consisted with a diﬀerent category organization. But if
words are features, then if the words are no longer correlated with the other features,
one should learn to disregard words when forming categories. Under such an account,
the shape bias would emerge, but would no longer be word-driven.

Figure 4-8: Second-order generalization by shape features on simulated datasets that
vary in coherence. Here, the coherence of the shape features contradict the organiza-
tion of the categories (given by word labels). If words are treated as features, rather
than taken as strong cues of category membership, the model learns that categories
are organized by shape, and that word labels should be ignored. But if words are
taken as strong cues of category membership, the model can learn no such thing (since
the categories picked out by the words now aren’t organized by shape), and therefore
does not acquire a shape bias.
Indeed, that is what we ﬁnd. I present the model with the same dataset, except
that the labels pick out categories opposite to those formed by the coherent correlation
of the other (shape) features. Figure 4-8 shows that, as expected, if words are assumed
to pick out categories then no shape bias emerges – the “categories” are no longer
organized by shape. If words are assumed to be features, there is evidence of second-
order generalization by shape, but this generalization is no longer word-based at all;
the model has learned that the word features should be disregarded.
It is somewhat unclear how this result bears on the shape bias debate. A situation
135

in which naming patterns completely go against all other visible features of a category
certainly seems quite unnatural, and it is possible to come up with explanations under
both accounts that capture this behavior. The distributional learning account might
simply point out that if words don’t vary coherently with categories, then a shape bias
in word learning should not be acquired. This might predict that a human presented
with data like that shown to the model would learn to disregard labels in categorizing
and forming second-order generalization. One future direction would be to perform
such an experiment, although the situation is so unnatural it may still be diﬃcult to
determine how it applies to children’s word learning.
Only an extreme version of the “words as categories” account would be unable to
explain the model results, and few would argued that all words are assumed to pick
out categories no matter what. Even if children begin with the expectation that words
pick out categories in general, this expectation is clearly defeasible in some contexts.
For instance, a study by Davidson and Gelman (1990), used to argue for a more
nativist account of word learning, demonstrates that children will only generalize
based on novel labels if the labels have some grounding in object appearance. This
is a somewhat similar circumstance to the results reported here, but it is diﬃcult to
describe what is going on in terms that yield clear diﬀerences or predictions within
this framework. Do children in the Davidson and Gelman (1990) study decide to
disregard labels because they view words as features, or do they assume that while
words pick out categories in general, there are exceptions? If so, how do children
determine when this is?
And how does this explanation diﬀer predictively from
the distributional account? It begins to look as if the diﬀerence between the two
perspectives may be a diﬀerence that makes no diﬀerence, at least in terms of the
implications for second-order generalization.
Study 2: Learning from a few examples
Another question inspired by the extensive literature on the acquisition of the shape
bias is how to account for the rapid learning reported in the experiment by Smith et
136

al. (2002), where teaching 17-month-old children four new words that were cleanly
organized by shape was suﬃcient to lead to the presence of a shape bias long before
one typically emerges. Why did only a few examples provoke such a large change?
This seems like the sort of question that a purely distributional, bottom-up associ-
ationist account is ill-equipped to handle, since associationist learning is generally
slower and more gradual. Indeed, although connectionist models have been shown
to capture many of the empirical phenomena in the literature about the shape bias
(e.g., Samuelson, 2002; Colunga & Smith, 2005), I am not aware of any that explain
this ﬁnding in particular.
One possibility is that category learning is useful because it enables children to
create “shape caricatures” or abstractions, resulting in improved object recognition
and rate of lexical acquisition (Smith, 2005). Evidence for this is that children between
17 and 25 months of age begin to be able to recognize stylized caricatures of objects
(both known and new), and increases in this ability are related to higher vocabulary
size. This suggests that language learning – in particular, learning the object names
that identify categories – is what drives these changes in shape perception. According
to this hypothesis, the Smith et al. (2002) experiment was so successful because the
new items were so simple and so cleanly organized that they enabled children to
form a more abstract notion of shape – and it is this that formed the basis of the
second-order generalization about shape.
Extension A: Adding new items to simulated datasets
Our model provides a way to begin to evaluate whether this sort of abstract feature
learning is necessary in order to explain the Smith et al. (2002) results. Unlike more
associationist or bottom-up methods, hierarchical Bayesian learning can quickly form
abstract generalizations on the basis of only a few datapoints. Can a model capable
of this sort of learning – but lacking in an ability to form abstract features or “shape
caricatures” – account for the type of rapid learning found in the Smith et al. (2002)
experiment?
I investigate this possibility by adding two additional items to the datasets in
137

Extension B of Study 1. These datasets vary in coherence as well as the number
of items (between two and sixteen) and categories (between one and eight). The
two additional items, meant to play the same role as the new words in the Smith
et al. (2002) experiment, are 100% coherent with respect to the shape features and
0% coherent with respect to the other features. Is adding them suﬃcient to create a
shape bias? As a control condition, I create a series of datasets whose two additional
items have the same average coherence as every other item in that dataset. This
condition ensures that any observed shape bias does not emerge simply because of
the addition of two objects, regardless of their nature.
Figure 4-9 shows the diﬀerence in the emergent shape bias in the “clean feature”
condition as compared to the control condition, at all levels of coherence except 100%,
where there is no diﬀerence between the conditions. In general, if the shape features
are already highly coherent, there is relatively little eﬀect of adding a few additional
items, since the shape bias has already been learned. (This would be equivalent to
running the Smith et al.
(2002) training study on children who already had the
shape bias). A shape bias emerges, however, on datasets whose other objects are
otherwise not coherent enough to support making a generalization by shape. The
simple addition of a few highly coherent objects to these datasets is enough for the
model to abstract this as a general bias, just as children do.
Extension B: Mimicking children’s vocabulary
Another possibly more relevant way to evaluate this question would be with a dataset
that approximates the input children have received by the time they are taught the
additional items. This is diﬃcult to do accurately for all of the reasons discussed at
the beginning of Study 1: what items have children seen? What are the features they
pay attention to? How are the items organized within categories, and which categories
do children know about? Though the problem of assigning features in particular is
an extremely diﬃcult one, it may be interesting nevertheless to construct a dataset
that approximates children’s reality as well as we know how. Work by Samuelson
and Smith (1999) and Smith et al. (2002) is useful here, since they report on typical

Figure 4-9: Role of adding two objects with highly coherent shape features, relative
to a control condition. If the dataset is already highly coherent by shape, there is
little additional beneﬁt to adding the new objects, since it already supported a shape
bias. But if the dataset is not already highly coherent, then these additional objects
are suﬃcient for the model to infer a higher-level shape bias across the entire dataset.
vocabulary organization at diﬀerent ages, as well as the average vocabulary size for
the children in their study.
Based on this work, I therefore create a dataset meant to more closely capture chil-
dren’s actual input when they began the Smith et al. (2002) experiment. According
to Smith et al. (2002), the average count noun vocabulary size for the 17-month-old
children at the beginning of training was 16 items. Assuming that the organization
of their vocabulary parallels that reported in Samuelson and Smith (1999), I estimate
that 9 of the 16 items are organized by shape, 6 are ambiguous between being or-
ganized by shape or material, and 1 is organized by material. It is unclear how to
estimate the number of exemplars children have for each of these categories, what de-
139

gree of feature coherence corresponds to “being organized by” shape, or what features
children have. As a rough guess, I assume that the number of exemplars per category
follows a Zipﬁan distribution. I also deﬁne three features in the dataset, correspond-
ing to shape, color, and material, chosen because they are the three features reported
on in the Samuelson and Smith (1999) study). Each feature has a suﬃcient number
of values for each object to be entirely deﬁned by that feature.3 This is of course far
simpliﬁed from the task facing children, but it may do as a ﬁrst pass. I also assume
that if an item is organized by shape or material, that means that it is 15% coherent
in that feature and 0% coherent in the others; if it is ambiguous between any, then it
is 10% coherent in both.4
Figure 4-10 compares model performance on this dataset with performance on the
same dataset with four additional categories of two items each. As in the Smith et al.
(2002) study, these categories are strongly organized by shape, which I implemented
by setting their coherence on the shape feature to 100% and coherence on the other
features to 0%. When given the dataset without the additional items, the model does
not show a shape bias; but when those items are added, one emerges.
Discussion
The problem of Feature Relevance, introduced in Chapter 1, may be addressed at
least in part by learning that can operate over multiple levels of abstraction. We saw
this in a diﬀerent domain in Chapter 3, where I showed that it might be possible to
form abstract inferences about syntactic structure even before lower-level knowledge
about the correct speciﬁc grammar is complete. The acquisition of the shape bias
is a phenomenon for which there is also strong reason to believe that a higher-order
inference is learned in time to constrain later generalizations. Previous work I did
3This is equivalent to assuming there are features such as, e.g., “cup-shaped” or “banana-shaped”,
rather than simply more generic features like “round.”
4This coherence is quite low, but these are the values I had to choose in order that the model did
not show a shape bias even without seeing the extra items. If there were more than one shape, one
color, and one material feature, then individual items would be picked out by a fuzzy combination
of many of the features of each type, and their coherence could be correspondingly greater without
inducing a shape bias.

The model, like children, does not show a shape bias. (b) Second-order generalization

with Charles Kemp (Kemp et al., 2007) presented a hierarchical Bayesian model for
the acquisition of the shape bias, which was a valuable ﬁrst step, but it assumed
that children are simply given category information – clearly a simpliﬁcation from
the complicated, noisy world that human learners are faced with.
In this chapter I presented an extended version of the Kemp et al. (2007) model
which is capable of clustering individual items into categories and inferring higher-
order generalizations about those categories at the same time. This work demon-
strates that learning overhypotheses like the shape bias is possible at the same time
as category learning. The extended model, C-L2, provides a basis for exploring one
of the oft-debated questions in the literature surrounding the acquisition of the shape
bias – the assumptions that children make about word labels. Simulation results sug-
gest that at least in this ideal learner setting, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
second-order generalization based on the presence or type of label information. This
work also allows us to explore how and why adding only a few additional items can
lead to a sudden emergence of a general higher-order bias.
In the following section I consider in more detail the implications and limitations
of these ﬁndings. What do they tell us about the shape bias in language, and how do
they bear on the learnability problems that motivated this thesis?
141

Words and categories
Perhaps the most surprising result in this chapter is the ﬁnding that there is no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between second-order generalization based on whether category
information is given to the model or not. This is true when the input is simple and
abstract, as with the dataset based on the Smith et al. (2002) study, but it remains
true for a variety of datasets that systematically vary in terms of coherence, number of
items, and number of categories. Although the analysis could always be extended to
cover datasets with more items or diﬀerent numbers of features, the ﬁnding is robust to
all of the variations I explored. From a purely computational perspective, this result
is sensible: it reﬂects the insight that to the same extent that some input supports
categorization, it supports forming second-order generalizations about the features
along which categorization occurred. As a result, being given the category information
makes little diﬀerence – if the categories are not strongly organized by a feature like
shape, no second-order generalization about shape is learned even when the categories
are known. Knowing the categories only leads to second-order generalization if there
is enough organization to those categories to support such a generalization; but if
that organization exists, an ideal learner will be able to infer the categories without
being told what they are. Figure 4-11 demonstrates this graphically, with the goal of
making it more intuitively clear how this is possible. As the category structure grows
increasingly incoherent, the strength of ﬁrst-order inferences (i.e., how each category
is deﬁned, e.g., “black dots”) and second-order inferences (i.e., the generalization that
categories tend to be long and thin) appear to vary in tandem.
The fact that this model is an ideal learner may play a critical role. It is possible,
even likely, that the cognitive limitations of a non-ideal learner could make word
labels far more important. Even if so, this analysis is still valuable. It points out
that if word labels have a special status, that status is not due to the informational
content they impart.
Even the strong assumption that words pick out categories
does not give the model appreciably more information on which to infer a shape bias.
Informationally, a second-order feature bias is supported to the same degree that ﬁrst-
142

Figure 4-11: Graphical depiction of category structure as a function of coherence.
The individual items, depicted via shaded dots, are 100% coherent with respect to
the categories in the graph on the far left. It is easy to make ﬁrst-order inferences (e.g.,
that the top category is shaped like a long thin rectangle, and is uniformly black) as
well as second-order inferences (e.g., that all categories tend to be long thin rectangles
and uniform in color).
The middle graph shows categories with lower coherence,
but that are still clear enough for both ﬁrst- and second-order generalizations to be
possible. In the ﬁnal graph, coherence is low enough that both ﬁrst- and second-order
inferences are diﬃcult to make. This graphically illustrates the degree to which both
types of inference emerge in tandem.
order information about categorization is supported; knowing that category structure
therefore does not provide signiﬁcant information about second-order feature biases.
This is a departure from some arguments in the literature. The idea that children
assume that words are privileged cues to category membership – while supported em-
pirically by a variety of research (e.g., Xu, 1999, 2002; Fulkerson & Waxman, 2007;
Bloom, 2000) – is sometimes justiﬁed theoretically as resulting from the additional
information such an assumption would provide. Waxman (2004) suggests that chil-
dren’s initial expectations about words “support the formation of a stable repertoire
of concepts” and help to establish reference. Xu (2002) suggests that a strong assump-
tion that words map onto kinds “may be a mechanism by which infants ﬁrst establish
what kinds of things are in their environment and how these object kind concepts can
play a role in object individuation.” The results in this chapter suggest that, contra
these ideas, the special status of words may not be due to the information they carry
about category. Although assuming that words pick out categories might help even
an ideal learner with ﬁrst-order category learning, these results demonstrate that a
strong assumption about words does not help with generalization beyond familiar
items.
It is possible (and in some ways easiest) in interpret these results as consistent
143

with the distributional account of the shape bias, which suggests that words are sim-
ply another feature, and that learning is based on the coherent covariation of items
that share a category. But it is also possible to interpret the results in ways that are
consistent with the notion that word labels have some sort of special status as long as
the learner is non-ideal in some way. Perhaps words serve as a memory aid, either be-
cause items that are labelled are easier to remember or their features are (e.g., Need-
ham & Baillargeon, 2000). Maybe distinct labels highlight the diﬀerences between
items, making it easier to identify which of many features matter – or, conversely,
maybe diﬀerent labels attenuate the diﬀerences between items (Robinson, Timbrook,
& Sloutsky, 2006). Perhaps children pay special attention to information imparted
linguistically or communicatively. Maybe perceptual biases arising from familiarity
or other aspects of visual and auditory processing aﬀect how children perceive and
attend to word labels (Sloutsky & Robinson, 2008). Any of these possibilities are
consistent with the ﬁndings in this chapter, which assume an optimal learner.
There is another option: perhaps word labels do not have an eﬀect here only be-
cause the categories they pick out here are relatively impoverished. If the categories
were associated with many, many other features, then solving the problem of Fea-
ture Relevance would become much more diﬃcult. In that case, words may indeed
contribute informationally, by picking out which features matter for categorization.
More generally, in any circumstance where the relevant features are signiﬁcantly out-
weighed by other features that coherently covary in another direction (or are simply
random) then some external clue about which features are relevant may become nec-
essary: words could serve such a purpose. This idea, which I present here in a rather
qualitative and impressionistic sense only, may be susceptible to quantitative analy-
sis in which the need for an external clue to Feature Relevance is a function of the
number of features and their degree of covariation. This is an interesting avenue of
future research.
The work presented in this chapter provides a new way to evaluate these pos-
sibilities. A thorough exploration would involve two main prongs of research: (1)
experimentally testing to what extent the predictions of the model capture human
144

performance; and (2) adjusting the model to make it non-ideal in interesting ways.
By yoking experiments with model predictions, we can determine precisely to what
extent people use category information to form second-order generalizations. For in-
stance, adults (or older children) could be presented with novel items corresponding
to the input given to the model in Study 1. Does giving subjects category information
or word labels improve their ability to form second-order generalizations? Do adults
diﬀer from optimal performance in any systematic ways? Experimental results along
these lines would dovetail nicely with modelling work investigating diﬀerent ways
of making the model non-optimal. This general research program oﬀers a valuable
way to ask and test increasingly subtle questions about the role of words in category
learning and the acquisition of the shape bias.
Feature learning and new examples
This work appears to address the ﬁnding of Smith et al. (2002), which showed that
presenting 17-month-old children with just a few examples of items cleanly organized
by shape was suﬃcient to lead to the presence of a shape bias (and increased vo-
cabulary growth) long before one typically emerges. When the model is presented
with a dataset that by itself does not support a shape bias plus two items strongly
organized by shape, it shows increased generalization by shape relative to a control
condition. Because the model is Bayesian, it is capable of making relatively strong
inferences on the basis of relatively few datapoints. As discussed in Chapter 2, this is
a byproduct of measuring likelihood with respect to the size of the hypothesis space.
Since each datapoint (item) is presumed to be independent, the likelihood of seeing
n items increases exponentially in the size of the space. Thus, seeing only two items
that are strongly organized by shape is suﬃcient to conclude that there a shape bias
of some sort.
A limitation of this ﬁnding, however, is that the model also forms a shape bias
even when the other items in the dataset are not organized by shape at all. This
does not appear to be a very sensible inference; wouldn’t a rational learner conclude,
instead, that the two new items simply follow a diﬀerent pattern than the other data?
145

An extension of the model that can learn on the level of categories (as does Model
C-L2) as well as kinds (as does the model in Kemp et al.
(2007)) may be more
appropriate for this sort of data. One would predict that if the other items in the
dataset were diﬀerent enough from the novel exemplars, such a model would, indeed,
simply assume that the novel exemplars are in a separate “kind” and do not bear
on the others. But if they were not too diﬀerent, only a bit more well-organized by
shape, there might be a version of the model that does learn the shape bias on the
basis of only those. Further adventures in modelling will explore this possibility.
The results from Extension A of Study 2 may appear to suggest that a few new
examples may have such a large eﬀect simply because they are highly organized
by shape, not because their features are in any way more stylized or abstract, as
suggested by Smith (2005). However, although the initial results of the model are
consistent with this suggestion, it is not yet well-supported. As before, a potential
limitation is that our model is an ideal learner: it may be that a learner who was non-
optimal in certain ways would not be able to form a rapid second-order generalization
without inferring abstract features of some sort. We can explore this possibility by
adjusting the model to have performance limitations of various sorts. Another issue
is that the two new objects were well-organized on all of the shape features; a more
realistic approximation might have items that are only well-organized on some of the
shape features. Much work therefore remains to be done here, but there are several
intriguing possibilities
We should also be extremely wary of generalizing from the model performance,
especially on the dataset designed to capture children’s actual category structure.
I had to make many approximations and guesses in designing that dataset. It is
unclear how many exemplars children have seen in the categories that correspond to
their count noun vocabulary at this age. The actual features that children attend
to are probably not simply shape, material, and color. Indeed, in order to properly
test the hypothesis proposed by Smith (2005), we would have to incorporate multiple
features of each kind, such that categories are only fuzzily organized around them.
Regardless of the results of that exploration, the suggestion of Smith (2005) yields
146

an intriguing challenge for modelers: how might a learner be capable of making infer-
ences about abstract features at the same time as forming categories and acquiring
higher-order learning biases? Is it possible to infer abstract features simply on the
basis of how features co-occur with each other within categories, or is more infor-
mation (say, features of features) necessary? Does forming an abstract feature or
“shape caricature” help in generalization and inference, even if it may not be strictly
necessary? Future work will address these questions and more.
Conclusion
In this chapter I presented a hierarchical Bayesian model capable of clustering in-
dividual items into categories and inferring higher-order generalizations about those
categories at the same time. This work demonstrates that learning overhypotheses
like the shape bias is possible at the same time as category learning. At least in this
ideal learner setting, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between second-order general-
ization based on the presence or type of label information. We also began to explore
how and why adding only a few additional items can lead to a sudden emergence of
a general higher-order bias, as found in work by Smith et al. (2002).
On a broader level, I have used a Bayesian modelling framework to explore some
classic issues of learnability in another domain. Although this work does not show
how to solve the Feature Relevance problem, since there were always a ﬁnite number
of features, it does provide one way to address it. Instead of assuming the innateness
of any observed higher-order constraints about which features are relevant, it may be
possible to learn such constraints. And although even higher-order assumptions (like
over-overhypotheses) of some sort must be necessary in order to explain this learning,
one take-home message of hierarchical Bayesian models is that the mere presence of a
higher-order constraint cannot be reason for assuming that that constraint is innate.
Our work suggests, in fact, that learning on multiple levels of abstraction can occur
simultaneously, and that receiving additional information on a lower level may not
speed up acquisition at a higher level.
In the next chapter I extend this model to a very diﬀerent phenomenon: the acqui-
147

sition of verb constructions. Whereas here the focus was on exploring the dynamics
of learning on multiple levels of abstraction, the next chapter centers more on the
No Negative Evidence problem. As always, however, threads of all of the learnability
problems and common themes about how to approach them will emerge. Finally, in
the last chapter I will explore these threads and themes in richer detail.
148

Chapter 5
The acquisition of verb argument
constructions
Chapter 1 introduced the learnability problems raised by the apparent lack of neg-
ative evidence in children’s input, and we saw in Chapter 3 how a Bayesian learner
might learn to avoid grammars that are too overgeneral, without eliminating over-
generalization entirely. In this chapter I address the learnability problems raised in
Chapter 1, in particular the No Negative Evidence problem, in the context of a spe-
ciﬁc, well-studied example: the acquisition of verb argument constructions. I extend
the simple hierarchical Bayesian model introduced in Chapter 4 to apply in this new
domain, and show that its behavior qualitatively matches children’s in several impor-
tant respects. This framework suggests how the negative evidence problem may be
solvable, and I ﬁnish by considering the assumptions and details built into the model
that lead to this result.
Baker’s Paradox and the puzzle of verb learning
Negative evidence – information about which constructions in a language are ungram-
matical – appears to be largely missing in naturalistic speech to children (e.g., Brown
The work in this chapter was carried out in collaboration with Charles Kemp, Elizabeth Won-
nacott, and Joshua Tenenbaum, and the model an is extension of Kemp et al. (2007).

& Hanlon, 1970), which poses a learning problem: without knowing how not to gen-
eralize beyond the language heard so far, a learner can only be certain that he isn’t
speaking ungrammatically if he is perfectly conservative, never saying anything he
hasn’t already heard. This poses obvious diﬃculties for scientists seeking to explain
human language acquisition, because it is quite clear that in many ways, children are
not conservative learners in this sense (e.g., Pinker, 1989). How, then, do they learn
language, realizing not only what constructions are grammatical, but which ones are
ungrammatical as well?
A classic and well-studied example of this puzzle can be found in the study of the
acquisition of verb argument constructions. In every language, diﬀerent verbs take
arguments in distinct constructions; for instance, the verb give is associated with
a construction requiring the verb to have two object arguments in addition to the
subject (“Debbie gave Dean the pretzel”). Not all verbs can occur in all constructions:
“Debbie gave Dean” is ungrammatical, and not a sentence one would expect out of
the mouth of a native adult English speaker. Rather, verbs appear to cluster together
according to which constructions they can appear in. This phenomenon is known as
subcategorization, and the clusters of each verb are called subcategories.
Consider the two constructions shown in Table 5.1. Given that many verbs in
English occur in both, it seems natural to conclude that verbs that occur in one of
the two can occur in the other. Unfortunately, this generalization – known as the
dative alternation – does not apply for all verbs: for instance, confess is grammatical
in the PD construction (“Jonathan confessed the truth to Doug”) but not in the
DOD (*“Jonathan confessed Doug the truth”). Despite never having been explicitly
taught that confess is ungrammatical in the double object dative – and even though
a near-synonym, told, is grammatical – ﬂuent speakers of English appear to have no
trouble avoiding the incorrect form. How is this explained?
150

In the following subsections I will evaluate several answers to this question, which
requires a critical and detailed discussion of some of the major empirical phenomena
involved. At the end of the section I will discuss these ﬁndings and elaborate on what
they mean and what has yet to be explained.
Hypothesis #1: The data is suﬃcient
So far I have only asserted, rather than demonstrated, the truth of the claim that
children do not receive negative evidence, or at least not enough. But is that actually
true?
At the minimum, there is a broad consensus that there is little overt correction of
ungrammatical constructions. In an examination of parent-child exchanges, Brown
and Hanlon (1970) found that parents were no more likely to express explicit dis-
approval (or less likely to express explicit approval) when children spoke ungram-
matically than when they didn’t. In some sense, this is no surprise: if adults did
frequently oﬀer explicit correction, it would be extremely diﬃcult to have any sort of
conversation, given how often children speak ungrammatically.
Another, more realistic, possibility is that children might receive negative evidence
in a more subtle or probabilistic form: perhaps adults give replies to ungrammatical
utterances that, statistically at least, can be used diﬀerentiate them from grammatical
ones. Indeed, there is evidence that parents more often repeat 2-year-olds’ utterances
when they are ungrammatical (Hirsh-Pasek, Treiman, & Schneiderman, 1984). Clar-
iﬁcation questions, verbatim questions, and “move on” conversational signals may be
statistically related to the grammaticality of children’s utterances (Demetras, Post,
& Snow, 1986). One study found that 34% of two-year-olds’ syntactic errors are fol-
lowed by implicit feedback of some sort, either via more frequent exact repetitions
when the utterance is grammatical, or more frequent recasts and expansions when it
is not (Bohannon & Stanowicz, 1988).
Is this type of indirect negative evidence suﬃcient? It is diﬃcult to know how
one would determine this deﬁnitively, but there are several reasons to think it might
not be. The information is probabilistic, after all, and often the diﬀerences between
151

the responses to grammatical and ungrammatical utterances would require impres-
sive statistical abilities to discern. Although there is evidence that children do have
impressive statistical abilities in many ways (e.g., Saﬀran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996),
it is not clear that they notice or track these diﬀerences in particular; and some have
argued that even if they do, the diﬀerences are not large enough to solve the negative
evidence problem (Gordon, 1990; Marcus, 1993).
Another problem is that implicit, subtle feedback does not tell the child what
precisely is ungrammatical, only that something is (or might be).
Was the word
incorrect, or the pronunciation of the word?
Was the verb used in an incorrect
construction? Were the words in the wrong order? Were important words dropped?
The child has no way of knowing unless the feedback is explicit. If the adult responses
are reformulations – which highlight, by their structure, the location of the error –
this problem may be mitigated somewhat; but, at best, this feedback is still only
distributional. In a study by Chouinard and Clark (2003), between 20% and 67% of
erroneous utterances were found to be reformulated, compared to between 2% and
38% of correct ones (see also Saxton, 1997). It seems clear, at least, that a Gold-
style ideal learner would not be able to converge onto the correct language given
statistical syntactic evidence of the sort considered here (Gordon, 1990), and as yet I
am unaware of any formal, concrete proposals for what sort of learner could.
Hypothesis #2: Language learners do not overgeneralize
One logical possibility for how human learners solve the negative evidence problem is
that, like the Subset Principle (Berwick, 1985), they are simply conservative, and do
not generalize in any systematic way beyond the input they hear. Unfortunately, this
explanation – or at least the strongest version of it – is quite clearly ruled out by the
data: both children and adults will cheerfully, and frequently, use words and construc-
tions that they couldn’t possibly have heard before. Children have been documented
producing novel causative forms like Don’t giggle me and You go it in (Bowerman,
1982); novel passives like It was bandaided (E. Clark, 1982); and novel datives like
I go write you something or You ate me my cracker (Gropen, Pinker, Hollander,
152

Goldberg, & Wilson, 1989). This is just the tip of the iceberg: Pinker (1989) cites
and discusses evidence from dozens of studies showing that children spontaneously
produce sentences that are clearly generalizations beyond what they have previously
heard.
Hypothesis #3: Learners use semantic information
One of the most important suggestions for how learners overcome the “no negative ev-
idence” problem is that there might actually be positive evidence about which verbs
enter into an alternation and which do not, in the form of correlated morphologi-
cal, phonological, or semantic features (e.g., Morgan & Demuth, 1996; Pinker, 1984,
1989). This “semantic bootstrapping” hypothesis is argued to overcome the learn-
ability problem by providing a feature that the child could use to distinguish between
verbs that do and do not occur in the alternation in question (Mazurkewich & White,
1984; Pinker, 1984). According to this hypothesis, the child notices the semantic and
morpho-phonological features pertaining to diﬀerent “narrow” verb classes, and learns
to generalize the syntactic alternation pattern based on those classes (Pinker, 1989).
For instance, many verbs that are not dativizable are of Latinate origin, and thus
have distinct morphological and phonological features (Green, 1974; Mazurkewich &
White, 1984) that predict adult speakers’ ratings of the goodness of each construction
(Gropen et al., 1989). There is also a strong correlation between verb meaning and
syntactic structure (C. Fisher, Gleitman, & Gleitman, 1991). In addition, there is
evidence that semantics play a role in constraining generalization: children are able
to use semantic information to generalize novel verbs (Gropen et al., 1989; Gropen,
Pinker, Hollander, & Goldberg, 1991), and assessments of the grammaticality of some
constructions is related to the semantic class membership of the verbs in question
(Ambridge et al., 2005).
Although the semantic distinctions between verbs that occur in diﬀerent construc-
tions are well-attested and appear to be productive in the adult grammar, there is
reason to believe that the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis cannot explain every-
thing about the acquisition of verb argument constructions. For one thing, semantic
153

and morpho-phonological classes do not suﬃce to capture the full verb-structure dis-
tribution (Bowerman, 1988; Braine & Brooks, 1995; Goldberg, 1995), and children
may have more diﬃculty learning verbs that the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis
suggests should be easy (Bowerman, 1990). Furthermore, it is demonstrably diﬃcult
to ascertain the meaning of many verbs based simply on environmental contingen-
cies and co-occurrences (Landau & Gleitman, 1985; Gleitman, 1990; Gillette, Gleit-
man, Gleitman, & Lederer, 1991). Even if, as Pinker (1994) claims, this diﬃculty
is only insurmountable for an associationist learner incapable of representing struc-
tured hypotheses about verb semantics or applying information from across multiple
situations, it is clear that in practice, syntactic information is enormously useful for
acquiring the meaning of certain verbs.
This hypothesis, called “syntactic bootstrapping”, does not suggest – despite what
its name may imply – that verb meaning is learned entirely (or even mostly) via syn-
tactic information; instead, it proposes that words are acquired through a probabilistic
process that depends on multiple cues, one of which is syntax. In particular, the ac-
quisition of less concrete words like abstract nouns and mental state verbs proceeds by
combining information from multiple sources, including extralinguistic world informa-
tion and syntactic structure (Gleitman, 1990; Gleitman, Cassidy, Nappa, Papafragou,
& Trueswell, 2005). Consistent with this, children appear capable of using syntac-
tic information to make inferences about verb meaning (Naigles, 1990; C. Fisher,
1996). In some circumstances syntax may be even more reliable than contextual cues
(Papafragou, Cassidy, & Gleitman, 2007).
Although the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is a powerful and well-supported
theory, it addresses the problem of Feature Relevance, not the problem of No Negative
Evidence. It is a theory about how a learner chooses among a logically inﬁnite num-
ber of possible verb meanings; although it suggests that multiple cues can mutually
constrain one another as that meaning is acquired, it does not bear on the question
of syntactic overgeneralization raised by Baker’s Paradox. By contrast, the semantic
bootstrapping hypothesis is a theory about how syntax might be acquired – and, in
particular, how certain syntactic overgeneralizations might be constrained by seman-
154

tic knowledge. Its ability to solve the No Negative Evidence problem is limited by the
degree to which it relies on semantic knowledge that may be unlearnable without the
aid of syntax (and implausible to assume is innate); but syntactic bootstrapping does
not oﬀer an alternate theory about how to resolve the No Negative Evidence prob-
lem. Thus, the original question remains: to the extent that correlated semantic and
morpho-phonological features are not suﬃcient to constrain syntactic generalizations
of this sort, how do children resolve the No Negative Evidence problem?
Hypothesis #4: Learners use indirect negative evidence
Another hypothesis, made originally by Braine (1971), suggests that learners might be
able to use indirect negative evidence, inferring that if a certain form does not occur
given enough input, then it is probably ungrammatical. One way this might occur is
through pre-emption: if a verb is encountered in one construction, when another, more
felicitous construction would provide the same information, the pragmatic conclusion
would be that the unseen construction is actually ungrammatical (Goldberg, 1995).
Children 4.5 years and older appear to be receptive to this sort of information (Brooks
& Tomasello, 1999), but as of yet there is no evidence that younger children do.
Another form of indirect negative evidence is entrenchment – the idea that the
more often a verb is observed in one construction only, the less likely it is to be gen-
eralized to new ones (Braine & Brooks, 1995). Both children and adults are more
likely to rate overgeneralizations as grammatical if they occur in low-frequency rather
than high-frequency verbs (Theakston, 2004; Ambridge et al., 2005). Indeed, even
children as young as two and a half to three years of age are sensitive to frequency;
the less frequent a verb is, the more likely children are to produce overgeneraliza-
tions (Brooks, Tomasello, Dodson, & Lewis, 1999; Matthews, Lieven, Theakston, &
Tomasello, 2005).
People are sensitive to distributional information on both the verb-general and the
verb-speciﬁc level. A large literature demonstrates that verb-speciﬁc syntactic biases
about which structures are likely to follow individual verbs have strong eﬀects on real-
time processing (e.g., Trueswell, Tanenhaus, & Kello, 1993; Snedeker & Trueswell,
155

2004). Verb-general eﬀects can also be seen; in particular, readers will sometimes
interpret nouns occurring after a verb as a direct object even when that particular
verb does not take direct objects (Mitchell, 1987; Juliano & Tanenhaus, 1993). This
overgeneralization is more common if the verb is low in frequency.
How are these relationships between verbs and constructions acquired? While it
is clear that semantic factors must play an important role in argument structure ac-
quisition, one possibility is that balancing knowledge on multiple levels may critically
depend upon distributional statistics. Support for this comes from a series of artiﬁcial
language learning experiments by Wonnacott, Newport, and Tanenhaus (2008). In
these experiments, adults were presented with languages containing novel verbs and
two synonymous novel constructions. In all languages the syntactic input distribution
provided the only cue to verb subcategory – semantic features did not correlate in any
systematic way with subcategorization – but the co-occurrence of verbs and construc-
tions diﬀered across the languages. Overall, participants proved able to acquire both
verb-speciﬁc constraints and to generalize. Critically, however,the tendency to gen-
eralize was aﬀected by a third source of information: learners exposed to languages
in which the majority of verbs occurred in both constructions were more likely to
generalize verb to a construction in which it had not occurred in the input.
This evidence suggests that people incorporate information about distributional
statistics on several levels of abstraction – from verb-speciﬁc information about par-
ticular lexical items, to verb-general inferences about verb classes or construction
types, to knowledge on an even higher level about variability across verbs or con-
structions in language in general. But does this sort of distributional learning bear
on the No Negative Evidence problem? And if so, what sort of learning mechanism
can combine multiple levels of information in such a way to allow overgeneralization
of low-frequency forms, but limit overgeneralization with increasing frequency in a
principled and justiﬁable manner?
156

Bringing it all together
The weight of the evidence indicates that people solve Baker’s Paradox, but probably
not by making use of negative evidence directly, nor by employing strategy of strict
conservativism. In the following sections I show that the hierarchical Bayesian model
introduced in Chapter 4 resolves the No Negative Evidence problem on the basis
of syntactic-only distributional information alone.
This occurs because of general
characteristics of Bayesian learning stemming from balancing simplicity and goodness-
of-ﬁt, as discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, which I address with respect to these speciﬁc
problem here. In addition, because the model is capable of learning on multiple levels
of abstraction, it can capture other empirical phenomena in the literature.
Study 1 reveals that the model captures adult performance in the artiﬁcial lan-
guage experiments of Wonnacott et al. (2008), demonstrating how such performance
results from making inferences about the sort of feature variability one would expect
across verbs or constructions in language in general. Study 2 shows that the same
model, given syntactic input for the verbs that occur in the dative alternation in a
corpus of child-directed speech, learns the correct alternation problem in the absence
of negative evidence. Moreover, it productively overgeneralizes verb constructions on
the basis of frequency. These results are especially interesting in light of the fact
that this model was originally developed to capture the emergence of feature biases
in word learning (see Chapter 4), rather than anything particular about verb learning
or verbal knowledge at all. Finally, in Study 3 I explore how learning is aﬀected by
semantic information being added to the input. Results show that the model is capa-
ble of using semantic information to make interesting syntactic generalizations much
as people do, even without strong assumptions about the nature of the semantic rep-
resentations or the nature of the semantic-syntactic linkage. Although I do not wish
to imply that these assumptions are unnecessary or (even if they are) that children
do not make them, the work suggests that a surprising amount may be learnable in
principle without them, and provides a framework within which to rigorously explore
the possibility in more detail.
157

Study 1: Modelling adult artiﬁcial language learn-
ing
Data: Artiﬁcial language input
The purpose of the artiﬁcial language learning experiment of Wonnacott et al. (2008)
was to determine whether adults exposed to a novel language could acquire knowl-
edge at both the verb-speciﬁc and verb-general levels.1 Over the course of ﬁve days,
subjects were taught a novel language including ﬁve nouns and eight verbs occurring
in one of two possible constructions: VAP (verb agent patient) and VPA-ka (verb
patient agent particle(ka). During training, participants were presented with a set of
scene/sentence pairs, hearing sentences (VAP or VPA-ka) corresponding to video clips
of scenes in which puppets acted out the sentence meaning. Because part of the pur-
pose of the experiment was to explore performance given only syntactic information,
both constructions had the same meaning.
Subjects were divided into two conditions based on the language they were exposed
to. One group was presented with a language in which each of the eight verbs occurred
in both constructions, but seven times as often in the VPA-ka construction as in the
VAP. Wonnacott et al. (2008) dubbed this the Generalist language. The other group
was exposed to the Lexicalist language, in which seven verbs occurred in the VPA-ka
construction only and one verb occurred in the VAP only. In both languages, the
absolute and relative frequencies of the VAP and VPA-ka constructions are the same,
but the conditions diﬀer widely in terms of the distribution of those constructions
across individual verbs; this allows for the evaluation of whether learners can acquire
and use verb-general as well as verb-speciﬁc statistical information. When presented
with a novel verb in one construction, would participants in the Generalist condition
be apt to infer that it can occur in both, even if one is more frequent? And would
participants in the Lexicalist condition tend to think that it can occur only in one?
1For simplicity of presentation, I focus on Experiment 3 in their paper, although the model
captures the results of all three experiments, all of which focus on the acquisition of knowledge
about variability across individual verbs.
158

To test this, participants’ grammatical knowledge was evaluated in two compre-
hension and one production test. I focus here on the results of the latter test, in
which productive language use was evaluated in a procedure ﬁrst established by Hud-
son Kam and Newport (2005). Subjects viewed a scene, heard the verb corresponding
to the action in the scene, and were asked to complete the sentence aloud. This pro-
cedure allowed the testing of both familiar and novel verbs.2 There were four novel
verbs which were not heard during training at all but were presented four times dur-
ing the test stage (just prior to the relevant production test): two of the verbs only in
the VAP construction, and the other two only in VPA-ka. The novel verbs are par-
ticularly interesting because they reﬂect subjects’ higher-level generalizations about
variability across verbs, rather than just information inferred about those particular
verbs, as shown in Figure 5-1a). People learning the Generalist language were likely
to produce a novel verb in both constructions, though with a strong bias for the VSO-
ka construction; they thus match the overall frequencies of each of the constructions
in the language and ignore the fact that the novel verb itself had only occurred in one
construction. By contrast, subjects learning the Lexicalist language, whose previous
input consisted of verbs that only ever occurred in only one construction, tended to
produce the novel verb only in the single construction in which it was observed.
Model: Level 2 and Level 3
The basic model, which was described in Kemp et al. (2007) and Chapter 4, applies
to the problem of acquiring word learning biases3 – but it can be reframed to apply
instead to the acquisition of verb argument constructions by simply changing the
input given. Where before the data consisted of observations of categories and the
number of times they occurred with each feature, the data now consists of observations
of verb types: the observations of each verb consist of the number of its tokens occur
in each construction under consideration. Where before we wanted to predict what
2Wonnacott et al. (2008) refer to these previously-unobserved verbs as “minimal exposure” verbs,
but for simplicity and continuity with Study 2 and 3, I will refer to them as novel verbs.
3The basic model we use corresponds to the one described in Kemp et al. (2007) rather than the
category-learning extension developed at the end of Chapter 4.
159

sort of features we are liable to observe category n with (i.e., level 1 knowledge about
features), we now would like to predict what sort of constructions we are liable to
observe verb n in (i.e., level 1 knowledge about verb constructions). Where before,
level 2 knowledge was knowledge about the distribution of features across categories
in the world, it is now knowledge about the distribution of verb constructions. As
before, this is represented by two parameters, α and β. In this context, α captures the
extent to which each individual verb occurs uniformly in one construction (or not),
and β captures the average distribution of constructions across the entire language.
Low α would indicate that each verb tends to occur uniformly in one construction (as
in the Lexicalist language), but does not say anything about which construction that
might be (here, verb-speciﬁc information would be necessary). The β would be the
same for both Generalist and Lexicalist languages, since (by design) both had seven
times as many instances of the VOS-ka as the VOS construction.
As before, this level 2 knowledge depends on knowledge at a higher level, level 3,
which is represented by the hyper-parameters λ and µ. The λ parameter captures
something about the range of values expected about the uniformity of constructions
(would it be extremely unusual to see complete uniformity, as in the Lexicalist lan-
guage? Is that the expected pattern?), and the µ parameter the range of values of
the expected distribution of verb constructions across the language.
In this chapter I consider two models. Model L2, which we have seen before,
assumes that the level 3 knowledge (λ and µ) is already known, and learns the α and β
values that maximize posterior probability for the given data. Model L3, by contrast,
learns λ and µ in addition to α and β, and assumes that knowledge at Level 4 is given.
Both models acquire level 1 knowledge about the expected constructions found in
speciﬁc individual verb types. Both models also make quite simple representational
assumptions, presuming only that individual verbs are represented as a vector of
features (consisting of the number of observations of each construction) and that
verb-general knowledge is represented by these higher-level parameters. The appendix
describes the technical aspects of these models in more detail.

Results: Learning construction variability
I present Models L2 and L3 with data corresponding to the input given to adult
subjects over the course of the ﬁve days of training in the Generalist and Lexicalist
languages. As with the human subjects, I wanted to evaluate how previous exposure
to the two languages would change how learners dealt with a small amount of verb-
speciﬁc information. The model was therefore also presented with a single exemplar
of a completely novel verb occurring either in the VAP or VPA-ka construction.4
Results are shown in Figure 5-1. Both models (L2 and L3) qualitatively replicate
the diﬀerence between conditions, demonstrating that the model makes inferences on
both the verb-general and verb-speciﬁc level, much as humans do. Novel verbs in
the Generalist condition are assumed to occur in both constructions, while the same
novel verbs in the Lexicalist condition are assumed to occur in only one.

tion were likely to produce a novel verb in both constructions, matching the overall
frequency of each in the language, rather than the single construction it was heard
in. Subjects in the Lexicalist condition, whose previous input consisted of verbs that
occurred in only one construction at a time, tended to produce the novel verb only in
the single construction it occurred in. (b) Model L2. (c) Model L3. Both models qual-

more closely.
Model L3 outperforms L2 in the Generalist condition, more accurately predicting
human production for the novel verb occurring in the less-frequent construction in the

have the memory limitations that humans do, it is more appropriate to evaluate its generalization

language (VAP). Even though that verb was heard in the VAP construction only, both
humans and Model L3 predict that it will occur in the other (VPA-ka) construction
nearly 87.5% of the time (which is the base rate of VPA-ka in the language as a whole).
Although Model L2 qualitatively captures the diﬀerence between the Generalist and
Lexicalist conditions, it is quantitatively less accurate, extending the VAP form to
VPA-ka 60% rather than 87.5% of the time. The reason for this diﬀerence is that the
hyperparameters (λ and µ) over α and β, which are “built in” for Model L2, weakly
restrict the range of α and β to avoid extreme values. The Generalist condition, in
which each of the individual verbs’ distribution of constructions precisely mirrors the
distribution in the language as a whole, is best captured by values of α and β that
happen to be dispreferred by the hyperparameters of Model L2. One might select
diﬀerent hyperparameters, but that would be arbitrary and post hoc; it could also
cause the model to be unable to capture a diﬀerent dataset. By contrast, because
Model L3 can learn the hyperparameters λ and µ, it infers that the more extreme
values are more appropriate for this dataset.
In the all of the subsequent sections, both Model L2 and L3 were analyzed, and
results were qualitatively similar for both. For space and readability reasons, I report
only the results from Model L3, which usually slightly outperforms Model L2.
Study 2: Modelling the dative alternation
Data: Corpus of child-directed speech
The previous study explored performance of the model given the data presented to
adults in an artiﬁcial language learning task, but it is important to determine how
relevant this is to the task facing the child. In this study I therefore present the model
with real-world data taken from a corpus of child-directed speech. Because the dative
alternation is a central, well-studied example relevant to Baker’s Paradox, I choose
to focus on verbs that occur in it. The data is collected from the sentences spoken by
adults in the Adam corpus (Brown, 1973) of the CHILDES database (MacWhinney,
162

2000), and consists of the counts of each construction (PD and POD) for each of the
dative verbs (as listed in Levin (1993)) that occur in the corpus.
An additional variable of interest is what sort of evidence may be available to the
child at diﬀerent ages. This can be loosely approximated by tallying the number of
occurrences of each verb in each construction in subsets of the corpus split by age
(see Table 2 in the appendix). The Adam corpus has 55 ﬁles, so the ﬁrst segment,
Epoch 1, contains the verbs in the ﬁrst 11 ﬁles. The Epoch 2 corpus corresponds to
the cumulative input from the ﬁrst 22 ﬁles, and so on up until the full corpus at Epoch
5. The dative verbs in the ﬁrst ﬁle only, corresponding to approximately one hour
of input, constitute Epoch 0. Splitting the corpus in this way is not meant to reﬂect
the data that children necessarily use at each age, but it does reﬂect the sort of data
that is available.
Model: Learning verb classes
The previous study demonstrated that both models can acquire verb-general variabil-
ity information, but this may not suﬃce to address the complexity of the problem
faced by a child. In natural language, verb-general statistics may be shared among
only verbs in a certain class rather than over all the verbs in the language. For in-
stance, some verbs occur in both constructions in the dative alternation, but others
occur in only one.
A learner that could only make inferences about verb-general
statistics across the language as a whole would not be capable of realizing that there
were these two types of verbs. Presented with a novel verb occurring only once in
one construction, such a learner might be more likely to generalize it to both than
one who realized that it might belong to a non-alternating class.
I therefore add the ability to discover verb classes (or “kinds”5) to both Models L2
and L3 and denote this extension with the preﬁx K (i.e., Model K-L2 and K-L3). As
in Kemp et al. (2007), this results in a model that assumes that verbs may be grouped
5Because “class” is more sensible nomenclature for verbs, I will refer to them as classes throughout
this chapter, but these are the same entities referred to as “kinds” in the Kemp et al. (2007) work
and in Chapter 4.
163

into several classes, where each class is associated with its own hyperparameters. The
model is not told how many classes there are, nor which verbs occur in which class;
instead, it forms the categories based on the data, in combination with a prior under
which all class assignments are possible, but fewer classes are favored. The goal of
learning is to simultaneously infer how verbs are assigned to classes, along with the
values of the hyperparameters that describe each class. It is described more fully in
the appendix.
Results: Overgeneralization with frequency and quantity of
data
Figure 5-2 shows class assignments predicted by Model K-L3. It captures the intu-
itively sensible pattern: those verbs that occur in one construction tend to be found
in a separate class from verbs that occur in both. Sensibly, when there is less data
(i.e., at the earlier Epochs), the model is less certain: the class assignments for sub-
sets of the full corpus are generally less sharp than they are for the entire corpus.
Frequency also plays a role; the model is more certain about class assignments of the
high-frequency verbs like give and call, and much less conﬁdent about the class assign-
ments of the low-frequency verbs like sing. In part because of this lack of certainty, we
would expect the model to be more likely to overgeneralize the low-frequency verbs
beyond the constructions in which they occur in the input.
Figure 5-2: Class assignments given by Model K-L3. Lighter colors indicate increasing
probability that the verbs in that row and column are assigned to the same class. The
diagonal is always white because each verb is always in the same class as itself.
164

There are two ways of testing this prediction. First, we can examine model pre-
dictions for how to produce novel instances for each of the input verbs. These results
are shown in Figure 5-3. It is evident the model overgeneralizes more often for the
low-frequency verbs. The predicted construction distribution for high-frequency verbs
like give or call is very similar to the observed distribution (shown in the associated
pie chart). But low-frequency verbs like explain or serve, which only occur in one
construction in the input, are nevertheless somewhat likely to be produced in the
other construction. This is because there is still some possibility that they are actu-
ally members of the alternating class; as more and more verb tokens are heard and
these verbs are still only heard in one construction, this becomes less and less likely.

Figure 5-3: Production predictions of Model K-L3 for each verb in the full corpus.
High-frequency verbs’ constructions are produced at a distribution close to their em-
pirical distribution, while low-frequency verbs are more likely to be overgeneralized
(i.e., produced in a construction that they did not occur in the input). The produc-
tion distribution is denoted with the stacked bars; the associated pie chart depicts
each verb’s observed distribution, and its empirical frequency is the number under
the pie chart.
Second, we can examine how the model produces novel instances of verbs it has
seen before, at each Epoch. Figure 5-4 shows the degree of overgeneralization for each
of the verbs that occurred in just one construction at each Epoch in Model K-L3.6
6We exclude verbs that have already occurred in both constructions in the data, because by
165

This is calculated by ﬁnding the diﬀerence between the proportion of times the verb
is observed vs. produced in the DOD construction.7 If this diﬀerence is zero then it
means the model produces the verb constructions precisely at the same frequency as
they occurred in the corpus. The larger this diﬀerence is, the more the model has
“smoothed,” or overgeneralized away from, the observed data.
The results indicate that as the frequency of the verb increases, overgeneralization
decreases: the diﬀerence between observed and predicted approaches zero. There is
also an interaction with Epoch: verbs of equivalent frequencies are overgeneralized
more in earlier Epochs. For instance, verbs that occur once in the full corpus are
overgeneralized one-third as often as verbs that occur once at Epoch 2. The reason
for this is that there is more data in the corpus at later Epochs, and the model is
therefore more certain about the probable constructions it infers for even the low-
frequency verbs.
Figure 5-4: Degree of overgeneralization of non-alternating verbs by Epoch for Model
K-L3. The y axis reﬂects the degree of overgeneralization, calculated by taking the
absolute value of the diﬀerence between the proportion of the time the verb is observed
vs. produced by the model in the DOD construction. Verbs of diﬀerent frequencies
are grouped in bins along the x axis: thus bin 1 contains all of the verbs that occurred
only once in the corpus, bin 2 contains verbs occurring twice, and so on.
Both models appear to be learning in the absence of negative evidence: although
they are never “told” explicitly that some do not occur in one construction or another
– nor do they receive any correction of early overgeneralizations – the models even-
tually form classes of verbs along precisely these lines. This qualitatively captures
two of the major phenomena found in the acquisition of verb argument constructions:
more frequent verbs being overgeneralized more rarely, and a general decrease of over-
deﬁnition, they cannot overgeneralize beyond the constructions in which they have been observed.
7One could equivalently calculate this for the PD rather than DOD construction; since there are
only two, this captures the same information.

Figure 5-5: All Epochs: degree of overgeneralization of non-alternating verbs by for

As before, verbs of diﬀerent frequencies are grouped in bins, such that bin 1 contains
all of the verbs that occurred only once in the corpus, bin 2 contains verbs occurring
twice, and so on.
To what degree is the change in overgeneralization with age and verb frequency
due to the fact that the model can group verbs into classes? I address this question by
comparing performance of the class-learning model K-L3 with Model L3 from Study
1. The results are shown in Figure 5-6. The ability to learn verb classes leads to less
overgeneralization at all Epochs, but many of the qualitative eﬀects are similar for
both models. Both capture three of the major empirical phenomena: learning in the
absence of overt negative evidence, and decreasing overgeneralization with increasing
age as well as verb frequency. This is because these aspects of model performance
result from general characteristics of Bayesian learning, rather than particular as-
sumptions made by any speciﬁc model. I address this point in more detail in the
discussion section.

167

One interesting empirical ﬁnding is that neither model captures is the “U-shaped
learning curve” reported for many aspects of language acquisition (e.g., Marcus et
al., 1992). In U-shaped learning, periods marked by overgeneralization errors occur
after an initial stage of correct production; yet in this model, overgeneralization is
greatest at the beginning. U-shaped learning can sometimes emerge from Bayesian
models, if the representation is complex enough that for the ﬁrst few datapoints it is
actually more parsimonious to simply memorize the exemplars directly (see Chapter 2
for further discussion of this point). This does not occur in this model, but that may
not be a concern, since the evidence for U-shaped learning curves in the acquisition of
verb constructions (as opposed to verbal morphology) is equivocal at best. The diﬃ-
culty is that correct performance involves avoiding overgeneral constructions entirely,
and unless a child’s entire productive output is sampled, it is diﬃcult to determine
whether the child knows the verb and never overgeneralizes incorrectly, or simply
failed to do so during the sampled segments. If, as has been suggested (Tomasello,
2000), the youngest children learn verbs on an item-by-item basis and do not form
the abstract notion of constructions until they are older, then we must examine indi-
vidual verbs rather than constructions as a whole. Of the eight verbs associated with
overgeneralization errors found in the spontaneous speech of ﬁve children in Gropen
et al. (1989), only three were used grammatically elsewhere in the corpus; of those
three, two were used grammatically before the error (Adam, ﬁx and put) and one was
used after (Ross, say). Does this support a U-shaped acquisition pattern? The data
are simply too sparse to tell. Even if it is true that very young children have abstract
knowledge of verb constructions at a young age (Conwell & Demuth, 2007), sparse
sampling still poses a problem: the rarer an error is, the more unlikely it is to be
observed in a corpus at the time it ﬁrst emerges (Tomasello & Stahl, 2004).
For instance, Gropen et al. (1989) examined the spontaneous speech of ﬁve chil-
dren in the CHILDES database. The children used both constructions in the dative
alternation (PD and DOD) idiosyncratically: 28 verbs occurred in both constructions,
22 potentially alternating verbs were used in the DOD construction only, and 24 were
used in the PD construction only. No child acquired constructions in the same order
168

for all of their verbs. Although overgeneralization errors were rare8, those that did
occur were preceded by grammatical uses of both DOD and PD forms – which might
suggest a U-shaped acquisition pattern, but there is reason to be cautious here.
In sum, then, it is unclear whether the lack of U-shaped learning mimics children’s
acquisition of verb argument constructions or not. However, the model does capture
other more widely-observed and well-established empirical phenomena: learning in
the absence of negative evidence, and decreasing overgeneralization as age and verb
frequency increase.
Study 3: Exploring the role of semantics
Thus far I have focused on the acquisition of verb constructions based on only syn-
tactic information, since that is central to the puzzle raised by Baker’s Paradox.
However, learning verb constructions involves the acquisition of semantic knowledge
as well: not only realizing what syntactic forms are grammatical, but also recognizing
what relationship those forms have to the semantic meaning of the verb. The precise
role that semantic features play in acquiring verb constructions is still debated, and
the answer is almost certainly more complex than I attempt to capture in this model.
The results from Study 1 and Study 2 suggest that at least some aspects of
the learnability problem are in principle solvable based on syntactic input alone.
Nevertheless, it is undeniably true that humans learn and use semantic as well as
syntactic information. For instance, children taught novel motion verbs in PD syntax
extend the verbs to DOD syntax somewhat diﬀerentially according to the semantics
of the verb – more often when the verb depicts transfer of possession than motion to
a location (Gropen et al., 1989). Does this model have the ability to use co-occurring
semantic and syntactic information to mutually reinforce each other in this way?
8It is diﬃcult to determine how, precisely, to measure “rarity” of a form.
Gropen et al. (1989)
found an incorrect DOD form in 1 out of every 3,924 sentences, yielding an error rate of 0.0003. As
they note, however, many sentences occurred in contexts where potentially dativizable verbs were
inappropriate. A diﬀerent measure might include only those, or might calculate over speciﬁc verbs
(either types or tokens); the latter measure yields an error rate that is considerably higher (between
5% and 14%), although still not large in absolute terms.
169

Data: Adding semantic features
I evaluate how semantics may be incorporated into the model by adding to the corpus
of dative verbs a semantic feature that precisely parallels the semantics of each of
the three classes.
This semantic feature therefore has three possible values: one
corresponding to the class of alternating verbs (which I will call semantic class A),
one to those verbs occurring only in PD syntax (semantic class P), and one to verbs
occurring only in DOD syntax (semantic class D). For instance, give, which occurs
106 times in DOD syntax and 44 times in PD syntax, has a semantic feature occurring
150 times in semantic class A; call, which occurs 46 times in DOD syntax, occurs 46
times in semantic class D; and say, which occurs 6 times in PD syntax, has a semantic
feature occurring 6 times in semantic class P.
Semantics are assigned in this way for several reasons. Semantics are not obvious
from corpora in the same way that syntax is, so it would be diﬃcult to assign semantic
features in a way that matches the actual input, especially since we do not know what
features are obvious or available to children in those situations. Furthermore, this
highly simplistic version of semantics allows for a clear exploration of precisely how
people might generalize when semantic features are (and are not) correlated with
syntax in the expected ways. In particular, the semantic bootstrapping hypothesis
suggests that semantic features are correlated not with the syntactic constructions,
but rather with the underlying “narrow” semantic classes – this is the reason they are
believed to be a useful source of evidence for solving Baker’s Paradox. Even though
Study 2 suggests that these features may not be necessary to solve the No Negative
Evidence problem, it is still interesting to ask how people might generalize when the
correlation of semantic and syntactic features follows this pattern.
To test the generalizations made by the model, I evaluate it on this corpus of
dative verbs (with semantic features included). In order to mimic the Gropen et al.
(1989) experiment and test second-order generalization, I add one additional novel
verb. The six conditions diﬀer in the nature of that novel verb, as shown in Table 5.2.
In three conditions the syntax of the novel verb is DOD, and in the other three it is

corresponds to the same semantic form it matches in the input data, I refer to that
as the Same Non-alternating Form condition (i.e., PD syntax, semantic class P; and
DOD syntax, semantic class D). If the semantic form occurs in the alternating class
in the input, that is the Alternating Form condition (i.e., both PD and DOD syntax,
semantic class A). And if the semantic form and syntactic form conﬂict based on the
input corpus, I refer to that as the Other Non-alternating Form condition (PD syntax,
semantic class D; DOD syntax, semantic class P). As a baseline, I compare these six
conditions to the sort of generalization that occurs when there are no semantic features
at all.
Model: Inference on multiple features
The models in Study 1 and Study 2 incorporate only a single feature, syntax, but
can be trivially extended to include multiple features, just as the model in Chapter
4 incorporates multiple category features. As in that model, we assume that each
feature is independently generated, which allows inference to proceed exactly as be-
fore except that each α and β is learned separately for each feature. The posterior
probability for the full model is therefore the product of the probabilities along each
feature.
Results: Using semantics for generalization
As shown in Figure 5-7(a), Model K-L3 generalizes according to semantics in just
the way children do in the Gropen et al.
(1989) experiment.
Both children and
the model are more likely to produce the construction they were not presented with
171

if its semantic feature is associated with the alternating class of verbs. Sensibly, if
the semantic feature matches the syntax of the same non-alternating form, then the
model rarely produces the unattested construction.
(a)
(b)
Figure 5-7: Percent of generalization of novel verb to the syntactic construction it
was not previously observed in. (a) Model K-L3; (b) Model L3. Model K-L3 behaves
qualitatively like human responses, generalizing most to the other construction when
the semantic feature is consistent with the non-alternating class, and least when it is
consistent with the same alternating class. Model L3 does not, indicating that the
ability to group verbs into appropriate classes is necessary to capture this aspect of
human behavior.
One interesting result is that, in general, the model is more likely to overgener-
alize a verb occurring in PD syntax to DOD syntax than vice-versa – but only if
the semantics is alternating. This is because among the verbs that alternate, the
DOD construction is approximately twice as frequent. Therefore when a novel with
alternating semantics is encountered in PD syntax, the model probabilistically puts
the novel verb in the alternating class, and therefore assumes that it tends to have
a similar distribution over constructions as other verbs in that class – i.e., that it
should occur more often in the DOD construction. But because the model also takes
verb-speciﬁc information into account (and because the verbs in the class are fairly
variable) it does not assume that its distribution will be identical to that of the class.
In other words, because a verb with alternating semantics will be assumed to belong
to a class in which the DOD construction is more frequent, novel verbs occurring in
the PD construction will be more often produced in the DOD construction than novel
verbs in the DOD construction will be produced in the PD construction.
172

The fact that the success of the model depends on its ability to form separate
verb classes is apparent when we examine the performance of Model L3, shown in
Figure 5-7(b). This model, which cannot form separate classes, generalizes each novel
verb identically, regardless of its semantics. In essence, the class information is the
vehicle for capturing the relationship between semantics and construction usage.9
Even without class information, the model is more likely to overgeneralize verbs
occurring in PD syntax to DOD syntax (rather than vice-versa); this is because it is
still capable of learning statistics on the level of the language as a whole, and in the
language as a whole the DOD construction is somewhat more frequent than the PD
construction.
One ﬁnal interesting result is that in the No Semantics and Other, Non-Alternating
Form conditions – i.e., when presented with a novel verb where either there is no
semantic feature, or when the semantics is inconsistent with the syntactic form –
Model K-L3 and Model L3 show opposite behavior. In Model K-L3 the novel verbs
are overgeneralized slightly more from DOD syntax to PD syntax, whereas in Model
L3 the opposite occurs. Why is this? Examining the class assignments in Figure 5-8
tells the story. Class groupings are as we would expect in the Alternating and Same,
Non-Alternating conditions. However, because the semantic features in the Other,
Non-Alternating Form class contradict the semantic features, it is diﬃcult to know
what to make of these verbs. The model therefore acts sensibly by assuming that
they are likely to be in an entirely new category of their own – a category about
which little is known. The model is slightly more likely to make this assumption if
the novel verb occurs in DOD syntax since there is already a high quantity of data
in the DOD-only class, which makes it fairly certain that the class is not associated
with semantic feature P. It is somewhat more uncertain whether the class of verbs
occurring in PD syntax is associated with semantic feature D, because there are fewer
examples in that class.
9It is easy enough to imagine a model that could capture the relationship between semantics
and syntax, perhaps by building it in via explicit hypotheses about semantics-syntax linking rules.
But it is interesting that even in this model, which has no such hypotheses, the relationship can be
learned as long as it has the ability to form separate verb classes.
173

Figure 5-8: Verb class assignments for corpus with semantic as well as syntactic fea-
tures, in six conditions of novel verb. In the Alternating and Same, Non-Alternating
conditions, the novel verb is grouped into the appropriate class; in the Other, Non-
Alternating condition, the novel verb is grouped in a class of its own.
One might object that it is unrealistic to assume the existence of one semantic
feature that precisely follows the correct verb classes. It may be far more accurate
to assume that there are many diﬀerent features, each somewhat noisy, that are only
statistically associated with the correct classes. Does this model qualitatively match
human behavior even if the semantic features are less clean?
To evaluate this I present the model with the same corpus, except instead of one
semantic feature with three possible values, each verb is associated with three se-
mantic features, and each feature is associated with the correct verb class 60% of
the time. The results in the same generalization task as before, shown in Figure 5-9,
are qualitatively identical to the previous results. It is evident that it is not neces-
sary for the semantic feature(s) to be perfectly clean in order to explain appropriate
generalization on the basis of semantics as well as syntax.
Even this is a simpliﬁcation of a situation that is undoubtedly far more complex:
certainly, one of the things that makes verb learning diﬃcult is that there are many
features (semantic and otherwise) that are simply irrelevant, uncorrelated with the
correct class assignments, perhaps even correlated with other regularities among the
verbs. To what extent does this result depend on this simpliﬁcation? I addressed

the broad question of Feature Relevance (of which this is a subset) in more detail in
Chapter 4, but we can explore it in this context by adding additional features to the
verbs in this analysis.
I therefore present the model with the same data as before – one syntactic feature
corresponding to the construction counts, and three semantic features noisily associ-
ated with the correct verb class – and add to it seven additional features. Three of
those are noisily correlated with the syntactic construction counts, and four covary
in such a way as to identify four completely diﬀerent verb classes. (Note that they do
not covary with each other; each of the features picks out a diﬀerent class organiza-
tion). Adding these additional features should act to partially outweigh the semantic
features. I evaluate the generalizations as before, based on the semantic features, and
the results are shown in Figure 5-10. As we might expect, the qualitative pattern is
still the same, but the generalizations are far less marked.
Of course, there will be some extreme at which the additional features are noisy
enough, or pick out other categories strongly enough, to completely wash out any
eﬀects of the semantic and syntactic features. For instance, I can add six additional
features to this already noisy dataset, and speciﬁcally set every features to be con-
sistent with a partitioning that puts all verbs in the same class. As a result, in this

features, plus seven additional noisier features, in six conditions of novel verb. As
before, in the Alternating and Same, Non-Alternating conditions, the novel verb is
grouped into the appropriate class; in the Other, Non-Alternating condition, the novel
verb is grouped in a class of its own. These eﬀects are much less marked than when
the features are cleaner.
dataset most of the features either directly support an analysis in which all verbs are
in one class, or support conﬂicting analyses that (at least somewhat) have eﬀects that
cancel each other out. As Figure 5-11 demonstrates, the resulting predictions this
time do not qualitatively capture human performance.
Figure 5-11: Verb class assignments for corpus with noisy semantic and syntactic
features, plus 13 additional noisier features, in six conditions of novel verb. Unlike
before, the model does not behave sensibly, largely because it tends to group all of the
verbs into one class, causing overall imbalances in construction distributions across
the dataset as a whole to play a larger role.
As I discussed in Chapter 4, generalization is a function of the coherence and
number of features that pick out the correct class assignments. This brief exploration
176

demonstrates that this sort of learning is somewhat robust to noise and error, but not
is not inﬁnitely so. A great deal of further work is necessary to understand precisely
how and to what extent additional features matter – to ﬂesh out what the shape and
nature of that “generalization function” is.
Discussion
In this chapter I have presented a domain-general hierarchical Bayesian model that
addresses how abstract learning about feature variability can be combined with verb-
general learning on the level of construction-based verb classes and verb-speciﬁc learn-
ing on the level of individual lexical items. It captures the qualitative patterns ex-
hibited by adults in an artiﬁcial language learning task, as well as those exhibited
by children over the course of acquisition. This model suggests that Baker’s Para-
dox can be resolved by a certain kind of learner, even based on syntactic-only input.
Furthermore, it does so in a (largely) domain-general way, without making strong
language-speciﬁc representational assumptions about verb constructions.
In the following section I evaluate these conclusions in more detail. I take care to
orient this research with respect to other computational models in order to highlight
its contributions and limitations.
Abstract learning about feature variability
Study 1 demonstrates how it may be possible to learn abstract knowledge about vari-
ability across verb types, just as adult subjects do in the experiment performed by
Wonnacott et al. (2008). Both humans and our model acquire diﬀerent generaliza-
tions based on whether the input comes from a language in which all verbs occurred
in both constructions or a language in which each verb occurred in only one con-
struction. This sort of statistical learning is part of a larger process of balancing
information on multiple levels of abstraction – a theme we observe throughout this
thesis – and the work demonstrates how this balance may be achieved.
To my knowledge there are no computational models that can capture the acqui-
177

sition of higher-level knowledge on the level of verb or construction variability. Many
models address the issue of learning more lexically-speciﬁc and detailed verb infor-
mation (e.g., Dominey, 2003; Chang, 2004). However, although several models are
capable of learning verb-general information about classes or construction types (e.g.,
Dowman, 2000; Onnis, Roberts, & Chater, 2002; Alishahi & Stevenson, 2008), even
these do not acquire even higher-level information about their variability, and would
therefore be unable to account for human behavior in the Wonnacott et al. (2008)
task. The work by Dowman (2000) and Onnis et al. (2002) is focused mainly on
the problem of negative evidence, and compares segments of toy grammars of varying
degrees of complexity. The work by Alishahi and Stevenson (2008), which is in many
ways an impressive model capable of capturing many aspects of semantic and syntac-
tic acquisition, nevertheless cannot account for higher-order knowledge about feature
variability. Their model and this one have numerous similarities: both are Bayesian,
both can ﬂexibly determine how many constructions or verb classes are appropriate
given the data, and both capture similar qualitative patterns in acquisition. But be-
cause their model does not do inference on the highest levels (level 2 or level 3), it
is capable only of learning about which semantic and syntactic features to expect for
each construction, rather than making more abstract judgments about how variable
they are expected to be.
Is the ability to learn on this level important in order to explain the acquisition of
verb constructions in natural language? Because many of the qualitative aspects of
acquisition can be captured by models that cannot learn on that level, it is possible
that this sort of learning is not necessary. Nevertheless, several considerations should
make us hesitant to draw this conclusion. First, the experiments of Wonnacott et
al. (2008) suggest that humans (or at least adult humans) are capable of this kind
of learning; it seems odd if people to have learning abilities that are too powerful
or unnecessary to the task to which they are applied. It might be that this sort of
learning is a domain-general capacity, useful when applied to other domains (such as,
perhaps, the acquisition of word learning biases, as in Chapter 4), that may not be
strictly necessary for the acquisition of verb constructions but that people are happy
178

to apply nevertheless.
Another possibility is that there may be conditions under which the ability to
learn about variability is particularly useful. For instance, the model presented here
is capable of learning the distinction between alternating and non-alternating verb
classes on the basis of syntactic input alone. The model of Alishahi and Stevenson
(2008) can form constructions, but only on the basis of diﬀerences in features rather
than on patterns of feature variability. As a result, it would be unable to form the
distinction between non-alternating and alternating verb classes without additional
semantic features to assist. Each individual verb usage would occur only in PD or
DOD syntax, and without semantic information diﬀerentiating alternating from non-
alternating verbs, the model would only be capable of inferring a maximum of two
constructions (DOD and PD). It would thus be able to learn that individual verbs
are alternating or non-alternating (and thus resolve the negative evidence problem for
those verbs). However, because it would have no reason to form a single alternating
construction, it would not – as our model does – be able to infer that a completely
novel verb appearing once in each construction is alternating, but that a verb appear-
ing twice in one may not be. This is the sort of generalization made by adult subjects
in the artiﬁcial language of Wonnacott et al.
(2008), and it is an open question
whether children or adults make it in more naturalistic circumstances.
A solution to the No Negative Evidence problem
One implication of this work is that it demonstrates how Baker’s Paradox may be
resolved on the basis of syntactic information alone. The Bayesian learner presented
here, given the syntactic information from a corpus of dative verbs used in child-
directed speech, can learn the appropriate categories of verbs. In so doing it solves
the negative evidence problem, correctly realizing that verbs that have been observed
often in one construction but never in another probably are not grammatical in both,
but that verbs that have been observed rarely in one construction and never in another
might be. In essence, the learner takes indirect negative evidence into account, and is
a formal instantiation of the notions of entrenchment and pre-emption suggested by
179

other researchers (Braine, 1971; Braine & Brooks, 1995; Goldberg, 1995). Consistent
with this hypothesis, the model – like people – is more apt to overgeneralize lower-
frequency verbs or verbs earlier in the process of acquisition.
This performance is not an idiosyncratic property of speciﬁc choices made in
setting up the model, but is rather the result of a general property of optimal inference,
as we saw in Chapter 2. Because Bayesian inference trades oﬀcomplexity (via prior
probability) and goodness-of-ﬁt (via likelihood), it tends to prefer hypotheses that
are neither too simple nor too complex, but rather “just right” (as in Hypothesis
B in Figure 2-2). As a result of this, as the number of datapoints increases, the
likelihood increasingly favors the theory that most closely matches the observed data,
and overgeneralization decreases. The likelihood in Bayesian learning can thus be seen
as a principled quantitative measure of the weight of implicit negative evidence – one
that explains both how and when overgeneralization should occur.
Because this pattern of inference is a general result of Bayesian inference, other
computational approaches to the acquisition of verb argument constructions provide
the same natural solution to Baker’s Paradox (Dowman, 2000; Onnis et al., 2002; S.
Niyogi, 2002; Alishahi & Stevenson, 2008). For instance, Dowman (2000) illustrates
the same principle explicitly, by comparing toy grammars with and without subclasses
of non-alternating verbs; as the amount of data increases, the more complex grammar
is preferred and overgeneralization disappears. Their work involves a simplistic toy
grammar segment and an idealized artiﬁcial corpus rather than the more naturalistic
child-directed data considered here, but both models show the same ability to deal
sensibly with the problem of negative evidence. More similarly to this work, Onnis
et al. (2002) use a Bayesian model to demonstrate the learnability of an alternation
based on statistics from corpora of child-directed speech. Their model succeeds in this
for the same reason ours does. Our model makes diﬀerent (in many ways simpler, more
domain-general) representational assumptions, and is in other ways more ﬂexible and
powerful, with the ability to learn on multiple levels of abstraction, and the ability to
determine ﬂexibly how many classes of verbs there are. But in terms of the problem
180

of negative evidence, all of these models – ours included – solve it in the same way.10
Of course, there are models – computational as well as less formal ones – that
do not provide the same natural solution to Baker’s Paradox.
These models can
be broadly classiﬁed into two types: those that, like the Subset Principle, do not
generalize at all (Berwick, 1985), and those that limit generalization on the basis of
non-syntactic features (e.g., Pinker, 1989). While the non-generalization approach
provides a solution to the problem in the sense that it explains how a learner might, in
principle, arrive at the correct grammar, it does not capture an important empirical
phenomenon: namely, that both children and adults do overgeneralize. Models that
constrain generalization on the basis of correlated features, of which Pinker’s (1989)
proposal is perhaps the most elaborated and elegant example, can result in periods of
overgeneralization. The diﬀerence is that the generalization is ultimately constrained
by the presence of the other, correlated features rather than by the accumulated
weight of indirect negative evidence. This sort of model is sensitive to indirect negative
evidence only in a trivial sense, in that it behaves diﬀerently based on whether a
certain sort of data is present or absent; a direct dependence on frequency is not a
part of this approach in the same way that it is for the class of models that performs
some sort of tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt.
One aspect of the problem that none of these models address – ours included
– is the question of how the child knows which sort of evidence is important: an
aspect of the problem of Feature Relevance.11 Pinker raised this point about indirect
negative evidence, saying that “it can’t be true that the child literally rules out any
sentence he or she hasn’t heard, because there is always an inﬁnity of sentences that
he or she hasn’t heard that are grammatical... So the question is, under exactly what
circumstances does a child conclude that a nonwitnessed sentence is ungrammatical?
10In fact, even connectionist models (e.g., Allen & Seidenberg, 1999; Desai, 2002) implicitly incor-
porate a sort of tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt. Often the tradeoﬀis non-optimal,
since the preference for simplicity emerges out of choices about network architecture, number of
training epochs, and other modelling choices rather than the mathematics of probability theory, but
as long as any tradeoﬀis being made, overgeneralization will decrease with increasing amounts of
data.
11Aside from the models that specify that the child must innately know which features are relevant,
that is.
181

This is virtually a restatement of the original learning problem.” (Pinker (1989), p.
14). How does the child know that those particular syntactic forms are the interesting
and relevant ones? How does she realize what semantic features are important? This
knowledge has just been given to this model, and this work makes no particular
claims about how it comes about. However, it is essential to realize that what I have
done is not simply restated the learning problem, as Pinker suggests: rather, I have
suggested an answer to one problem (the No Negative Evidence problem, or how to
rule out logically possible alternatives without negative evidence), leaving another
still unsolved (the Feature Relevance problem, or how to know which of a potentially
inﬁnite number of dimensions to generalize along). Though the latter problem remains
a diﬃcult and open question, it is not the same problem. The logic of Baker’s Paradox
would be the same even if there were only one possible dimension of generalization:
the dilemma exists because one can never be certain that an unobserved datapoint
(along that dimension) is truly ungrammatical, or simply unobserved. How the learner
knows which dimensions to pay attention to is a diﬀerent issue, an aspect of which I
considered (albeit in a diﬀerent domain) in Chapter 4.
Representational assumptions
Because this model was originally developed for a completely diﬀerent domain, it
makes few domain-speciﬁc assumptions about the representation of verbs and verb
constructions. Both semantic and syntactic information is represented as a vector
of features. An advantage of the simpler representation is that it highlights which
phenomena emerge due to the nature of the data and the characteristics of Bayesian
(optimal) inference, rather than because of the domain-speciﬁc representation. The
only domain-speciﬁc knowledge in the model is in the assumption that the syntactic
forms corresponding to verb constructions are already known by the learner to be the
features that inference must operate over. Actually learning that, say, NP1 V NP3
NP2 is a construction is itself a complex learning problem, and not one that this work
bears on. But a signiﬁcant part of the debate about verb construction learning is
about the issue I focus on in Study 2 and Study 3: how to generalize properly over
182

the constructions seen in the input once it is clear what they are.
I do not claim that all aspects of verb learning (or even most of the interesting ones)
can be accounted for by a model that makes the sparse representational assumptions
this one does. In one sense this sort of representation is an advantage, because it
clariﬁes and highlights precisely what aspects of learning derive from the Bayesian
paradigm and which derive from the speciﬁc representation; and it allows us to explore
the contribution of additional semantic features in the abstract, without worrying
about their accessibility or precisely what they are. The tradeoﬀ, of course, is that
we are therefore abstracting over many details that might be critical for understanding
the acquisition of particular verbs or asking the question of what particular semantic,
conceptual, or syntactic knowledge must be built in order for the child to perceive
which features are important and relevant.
Although Study 2 may appear to imply that some aspects of verb construction
learning could be accomplished without semantic information, I am not suggesting
that semantics are not an important part of learning verbs. Indeed, Study 3 was
motivated by the fact that verb learning must include semantic as well as syntactic
knowledge. We found that it is necessary to include some sort of semantic repre-
sentation in order to capture the sort of generalization captured by the experiments
of Gropen et al. (1989). Interestingly, although I did not build in innate semantic-
syntactic rules of the sort theorized by both the semantic and syntactic bootstrapping
hypotheses, as long as the model could form classes of verbs it was capable of cap-
turing relationships between syntax and semantic class. I am hesitant to draw any
strong conclusions from this result, but it does suggest the utility of further work
in this direction, exploring to what extent innate linking rules are required to ab-
stract semantic-syntactic relationships when the data and representations are more
complicated and realistic.
Another interesting possibility suggested by the analysis here is that perhaps
syntactic information was so eﬀective because I gave the model clean features that
already picked out precisely the constructions of interest. If both the semantic and
syntactic features available to the child are far more noisy – and hidden amongst
183

many irrelevant features in the environment – then it may be that semantic and
syntactic features only become accessible through a process of mutual bootstrapping.
One could even imagine a model in which one or a few extremely coherent or salient
features provided information suﬃcient to pick out features that would otherwise
be too incoherent or diﬃcult to observe – as may happen for particularly abstract
semantics, like those corresponding to verbs of mental state (Gleitman et al., 2005;
Papafragou et al., 2007). This might capture results reported by Ambridge, Pine,
Rowland, and Young (2008), which found that for younger children (age 5-6) there
was only a small eﬀect of semantic class on generalization, whereas for older children
and adults, there was a larger and signiﬁcant one. Similarly, Brooks et al. (1999)
found that entrenchment eﬀects (in syntax) emerged before semantic class eﬀects.
Addressing these ideas, or others that explore the roles of syntax and semantics more
fully, will probably require a richer semantic representation than the current model
instantiates. Future work will explore this idea in more detail.
Conclusion
This chapter extends the hierarchical Bayesian model introduced in Chapter 4 to
explore several issues relevant to the acquisition of verb argument constructions.
Although the model was originally developed to address the acquisition of feature
biases in word learning, it can also explain how abstract learning about feature vari-
ability can be combined with verb-general learning on the level of construction-based
verb classes and verb-speciﬁc learning on the level of individual lexical items. This
work demonstrates clearly how the No Negative Evidence problem can be solved by a
Bayesian learner due to its ability to balance simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt when eval-
uating hypotheses for generalization. Additionally, I demonstrate how this model can
acquire the dative alternation based on syntactic-only input from actual child-directed
speech while capturing the qualitative patterns exhibited by adults in an artiﬁcial lan-
guage learning task and by children over the course of acquisition. Furthermore, it
does so in a (largely) domain-general way, without making strong language-speciﬁc
184

representational assumptions about verb constructions.
In the next and ﬁnal chapter I consider how the work in this chapter, in combi-
nation with that from Chapters 3 and 4, can shed light on the learnability problems
motivating this thesis. What broader questions do each of these speciﬁc models ad-
dress? What themes underlie each component of this research, and what general
lessons can we infer from this work? Finally, where should we go in the future?

Chapter 6
Discussion
The main goal of this thesis was to explore three common learnability arguments
by formalizing them in Bayesian terms.
By focusing on these classic learnability
arguments in the context of three major questions in language acquisition, I was able
to explore the issues of representation and learnability from multiple angles, and to
shed new light on these old questions.
In this chapter I step back and position this work in a larger context. What are
its implications for those studying language acquisition and cognitive development?
What are its major limitations?
In an eﬀort to make this discussion maximally
accessible (particularly because I revisit many points that I have already addressed
to some degree elsewhere) this chapter will be written in a more colloquial tone.
Simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt tradeoﬀ
Q: You suggest that a Bayesian learner can actually solve the No Negative
Evidence problem. How is this possible?
I answer this question abstractly in some detail in Chapter 2 and touch on the rea-
soning again in Chapters 3 and 5, but in a nutshell, the solution emerges because
Bayesian inference trades oﬀthe complexity of a hypothesis (reﬂected in its prior
probability) and how well that hypothesis ﬁts to the observed data (reﬂected in the
187

likelihood). As a result, it tends to prefer hypotheses that – like B in Figure 2-2 –
strike a balance between being overly simple (hence missing important details) and
overly complex (hence overﬁtting). Because the importance of ﬁtting the data in-
creases with the number of datapoints, there is an interesting pattern as the amount
of data increases. When there are only a few datapoints, Bayesian learners tend to
favor simpler hypotheses, because the importance of simplicity outweighs the lack of
ﬁt to those few datapoints. But as the number of datapoints increases, ﬁtting them
badly matters more and more (since there are more of them, and each one is penal-
ized). As the size of the dataset approaches inﬁnity, a Bayesian learner rejects larger
or more overgeneral hypotheses in favor of more precise ones, as the Subset Principle
would do. But with limited amounts of data, the Bayesian approach can make more
subtle predictions.
You can see how this would solve the No Negative Evidence problem: as the
learner observes more and more data, he becomes less and less likely to think that
something that was unobserved is nevertheless permissible. Essentially, the likelihood
captures the notion of a suspicious coincidence. If a gumball machine gives me ten
blue gumballs in a row, I’m going to be fairly certain that it only gives blue gumballs;
it’s at least more likely than thinking that somehow, coincidentally, I just happened
to never get green or red or yellow ones. The nice thing about Bayesian inference is
that it gives a quantitative way of determining when the coincidence grows too great.
Why am I not likely to think that the machine gives only blue gumballs after just
receiving one, but will think it does after ten? Being able to calculate the tradeoﬀ
between simplicity and likelihood allows us to answer this question. In essence, the
likelihood in Bayesian learning is a principled quantitative measure of the weight of
implicit negative evidence – one that explains both how and when overgeneralization
should occur.
A side eﬀect of this reasoning is that frequency becomes very important. Because
quantity of data is the deciding factor in determining how overgeneral the hypothesis
should be, a Bayesian learner overgeneralizes more when there is less data. This is
what we saw in Chapter 3, where the 1-ST grammar (which accepts any sentence
188

as grammatical) was preferred on smaller corpora and the context-free grammars
were preferred on larger ones. It also explains the frequency eﬀects found in Chapter
5, where the low-frequency items tended to be overgeneralized much more than the
higher-frequency ones.
Q: This doesn’t sound all that diﬀerent from people who argued that
indirect negative evidence is the way to solve the No Negative Evidence
problem.
Isn’t this just a version of the same thing?
And isn’t this,
therefore, vulnerable to the same counter-arguments?
It is indeed a very similar idea. One major diﬀerence is simply that conceptualizing
the notion of indirect negative evidence in Bayesian terms allows us to justify why
a learner might deal with indirect negative evidence in this way. There is a lot of
research explaining why Bayesian learning constitutes optimal inference; in essence, a
non-Bayesian reasoner attempting to predict the future will always be out-predicted
by a Bayesian reasoner in the long run (e.g.,
de Finetti, 1937; Jaynes, 2003). It
is also hardly a new idea to point out that making use of a simplicity criterion can
enable a learner to limit overgeneralization in the “right” way (Solomonoﬀ, 1964, 1978;
Rissanen & Ristad, 1992; Chater & Vit`anyi, 2007). A byproduct of reasoning with
such a criterion in mind, while also being concerned with goodness of ﬁt, is becoming
sensitive to indirect negative evidence – information about what isn’t there, as well
as what is.
The other major diﬀerence is that the Bayesian framework provides a method
that oﬀers quantitative and precise predictions, rather than simply a qualitative idea.
Without quantitative details, it can be diﬃcult to test or falsify speciﬁc claims. How
much negative evidence is suﬃcient? How does this depend on the complexity of the
representation and the nature of the evidence that is observed? Formalizing the idea
of indirect negative evidence in Bayesian terms allows us to rigorously address these
questions.
The main counter-argument to the idea of indirect negative evidence is that point
that people need to already know the relevant dimensions of generalization in order
189

to be sensitive to it. I discussed this in Chapter 5, since Pinker’s objection is a version
of this: “under exactly what circumstances does a child conclude that a nonwitnessed
sentence is ungrammatical? This is virtually a restatement of the original learning
problem.” (Pinker (1989), p. 14). How does the child know that those particular
syntactic forms are the relevant ones? This is, indeed, a hard problem – but it is not
the No Negative Evidence problem per se. The logic of the No Negative Evidence
problem remains the same whether there is one possible dimension of generalization,
or an inﬁnite number: the dilemma comes because one can never be certain that
an unobserved datapoint (along that dimension) is truly ungrammatical, or simply
unobserved. Indeed, in the formulation by Gold (1967) there is only one dimension
of relevance: which formal grammar is appropriate.
So, I agree that the simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt tradeoﬀdoesn’t solve the Feature
Relevance problem. I hope that one virtue of my analysis has been to make clear that
the Feature Relevance problem is a separate problem from the No Negative Evidence
problem, which a Bayesian learner can overcome.
Q: But how can this be reconciled with the logic of the No Negative
Evidence argument? I haven’t seen you show where it is wrong.
You’re right that I haven’t argued against the logic of the No Negative Evidence
problem at any point. It is true that without negative evidence one cannot logically
rule out hypotheses that are consistent with, but supersets of, the observed data. If
the hypothesis space is inﬁnite – as it is in Gold’s 1967 analysis, and as it is in many
interesting problems in language acquisition – we cannot simply wait until seeing all
of the data before concluding that the correct hypothesis is the most conservative
one. It is impossible to deductively rule out all of the inﬁnite numbers of consistent
superset hypotheses on the basis of positive-only ﬁnite data. It was impossible at the
beginning of this thesis, and it remains impossible now.
However, a Bayesian learner does not deductively rule out consistent superset
hypotheses; it simply assigns them less and less probability as the amount of data
increases. This eﬀectively converts the logical problem into a probabilistic problem;
190

and while a learner may never be 100% conﬁdent that it has converged to the correct
hypothesis, it can quickly get to the point that the probability of other hypotheses is
vanishingly small.
So this isn’t a logical solution.
It is, however, a solution in the sense that it
oﬀers an explanation for how an actual learner might deal with and overcome the
problem in practice. This ties back into a point I made ﬁrst in Chapter 1, when
I talked about the importance of exploring how an ideal learner might handle real
datasets. This sort of analysis, instead of focusing on all of the many ways that some
abstract learning problem is impossible in theory, reframes to ask what can be learned
in a more realistic situation, or what sort of learner can deal with realistic data in
a reasonable way. Since we’re ultimately interested in how human learners actually
learn from data, this seems like an important question.
Q: You say that Bayesian learning solves the No Negative Evidence prob-
lem because it instantiates the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-
of-ﬁt. But isn’t “simplicity” a completely arbitrary metric?
Well, no. As I discuss in Chapter 2, the deﬁnition of simplicity emerges naturally from
the generative assumptions underlying the Bayesian framework, in which hypotheses
are themselves generated from a space of candidate hypotheses. If we conceptualize
hypotheses as being generated through a series of choices – as in the dot examples in
Chapter 2, or the grammars in Chapter 3 – then simpler hypotheses are those that
require fewer “choice points.” This is an intuitively sensible notion of simplicity. I
think it’s safe to say that we would all agree that the more complicated something is,
the easier it is to mess it up: there are more choices you have to make, more places
where you could zig instead of zag.
The precise prior probability of a hypotheses is therefore not arbitrarily assigned,
but rather falls out in a principled way from how the hypotheses are generated. In
Chapter 2 I mentioned the idea of a “generative model for recipes” whose “primi-
tives” are recipe ingredients and measurements. The analysis in Chapter 3 assumes a
generative model for grammars whose “primitives” are terminals, non-terminals, and
191

rules (which are built from the terminals and non-terminals). Though I didn’t discuss
the models in Chapter 4 and 5 explicitly using this terminology, their primitives are
parameters and hyperparameters of distributions. In every case, the logic favoring
simple hypotheses is the same: multiple choices are a priori less likely than a few.
I have one important caveat. While is always true that within the set of choices
deﬁned by the generative model the hypothesis that requires fewer choices has higher
probability, one could always change the primitives of the model to design some
Bizarro World model that looks to us as though it assigns higher probability to more
complicated-looking hypotheses.
For instance, if I deﬁned a generative model for
grammars whose primitives were speciﬁc 50-rule grammars that could be added to
and subtracted from in complicated ways, it might look like one of those grammars was
a priori “simpler” than a grammar with one rule only. Simplicity is only meaningful
relative to the set of primitives out of which the hypotheses are generated, and in that
sense any simplicity metric is indeed arbitrary. But this is true for any computational
model (in which the primitives deﬁne the space of possible behavior) or, indeed,
any theory (where the primitives assumed about the learner or the task implicitly
deﬁne the solutions that can be found).
This doesn’t mean we should all retire
and go into management consulting or stock-car racing; it means that we should be
aware that one’s choice of primitives, whether implicit or explicit, counts among the
assumptions made by the theory. Whether those are the appropriate primitives is
an empirical question, and interesting theoretical work might be done showing that
with a diﬀerent choice of primitives, very diﬀerent results occur. But for the most
part, unless the primitives are very diﬀerent, the assignment of simplicity will often
produce broadly similar results across the board. And either way, it oﬀers a solution
to the No Negative Evidence problem.
192

Q: Any learner is only as good as its assumptions; there is no such thing
as a free lunch. What assumptions does this sort of Bayesian reasoning
depend on, and in what situations will those assumptions lead the learner
astray?
Implicit in all of the models in this thesis, and most Bayesian models more generally,
is an assumption that data is generated based on a process in which each datapoint
is sampled independently of one another. This is not an in-principle assumption that
Bayesian models must make – one could make any well-deﬁned sampling assumptions
one wished – but assuming independence makes the mathematics considerably easier.
If the data is not actually independently generated, a Bayesian learner assuming that
it is may infer the wrong model.
A similar situation would arise if for some reason data were systematically (rather
than randomly) excluded from the observed evidence in the world (e.g., due to perfor-
mance limitations not captured in the assumed generative process). All other things
being equal, a Bayesian learner faced with this dataset might (wrongly) infer that the
generalization that would produce the missing data is not permitted.
In both of these cases, the problem emerges because the assumptions made about
the generative process are not accurate. In general, the performance of a Bayesian
learner depends in an important way on these assumptions. Since the generative
process also deﬁnes the hypothesis space, if the correct solution does not lie in the
hypothesis space, the learner will not arrive at it. This point may appear trivial,
but it highlights the importance of deﬁning the generative process, hypothesis space,
and representational capacity with care. (Of course, even if one’s hypothesis space
excludes the “correct” hypothesis – as is probably true for all of the analyses presented
in this thesis, due to their simplicity – the analysis can still be a useful way of
comparing the theories that are in the hypothesis space).
193

Ideal learner, real dataset
Q: What is the point of exploring the performance of an ideal learner,
given that we’re interested in actual human cognition?
This is a common issue, and I address it throughout this thesis, especially in Chapters
1, 2, and 3. Ideal learnability arguments focus on the question of whether something
is learnable in principle, given the data. By describing the characteristics of an ideal
learner and then evaluating whether it could acquire the knowledge in question, these
analyses suggest a series of testable questions and are a positive way of guiding further
inquiry. To what extent do humans really have the hypothesized characteristics? Are
the assumptions made about the data accurate? Do the ways in which the analysis
departs from reality prove critically important? If so, why? If not, why not?
Whether or not people are ideal learners themselves, understanding how humans
do reason can often be made if one can identify the ways in which people depart
from the ideal: this is approximately the methodology by which Kahneman and
Tversky derived many of their famous heuristics and biases. Bayesian modelling is
an implementation of scientiﬁc inquiry that operates on Marr’s third (computational)
level, which seeks to understand cognition based on what its goal is, why that goal
would be appropriate, and the constraints on achieving that goal, rather than precisely
how it is implemented algorithmically (Marr, 1982). Understanding at this level is
important because the nature of the reasoning may often depend more on the learner’s
goals and constraints than it does on the particular implementation. This approach
allows us to examine rigorously the inductive logic of learning – what constraints
are necessary given the structure of the hypothesis space and the data available to
learners – independent of the speciﬁcs of the algorithms used.
Q: In what way is Bayesian learning “optimal”, anyway? That sounds like
a value judgment rather than a scientiﬁc claim.
As I note in Chapter 2, Bayesian inference is optimal in the sense that a non-Bayesian
reasoner attempting to predict the future will always be out-predicted by a Bayesian
194

reasoner in the long run (de Finetti, 1937). It is essentially an extension of deductive
logic to the case where propositions have degrees of truth or falsity (and is identical
to deductive logic if we know all the propositions with 100% certainty). Thus, just
as formal logic describes a deductively correct way of thinking, Bayesian probability
theory describes an inductively correct way of thinking (Jaynes, 2003).
If we were to try to come up with a set of desiderata that a system of “proper
reasoning” should meet, they might include things like consistency and qualitative
correspondence with common sense – if you see some data supporting a new proposi-
tion A, you should conclude that A is more plausible rather than less; the more you
think A is true, the less you should think it is false; if a conclusion can be reasoned
multiple ways, its probability should be the same regardless of how you got there; etc.
The basic axioms and theorems of probability theory, including Bayes’ Rule, emerge
when these desiderata are formalized mathematically (Cox, 1946, 1961). Bayesian
inference has also been shown to correspond to common-sense reasoning and the
scientiﬁc method (Jeﬀreys, 1931, 1939; de Finetti, 1974; Jaynes, 2003).
Q: Okay, you’ve convinced me that an ideal learning analysis is worthwhile.
But what’s the point of studying realistic datasets? It seems like you lose
your ability to make any general claims if you do that.
Yes, there is an inherent tradeoﬀhere. One of the real virtues of ideal learnability
analyses on ideal datasets, as we saw in Chapter 1, is that they are more general and
not tied to the vagaries or idiosyncracies of any particular dataset. At the same time,
they are only a ﬁrst step (at best) for anybody interested in human cognition. If the
ultimate goal of cognitive science is to understand how realistic learners use realistic
data, then – given that we don’t yet understand how realistic learners do their thing
– exploring how an ideal learner can use realistic data is an important next step.
This is not just a step forward; it also reframes the questions in a useful way.
Instead of asking what is learnable in the limit (or not), we can focus on what learn-
ers actually could learn – and how diﬀerent representational or other assumptions
aﬀect that. As an example, in Chapter 1 I mentioned research showing that making
195

the assumption that grammars are probabilistic does not actually expand the class
of learnable languages (Angluin, 1988; P. Niyogi, 2006). Positive learnability results
emerge only if the probability distribution on rules µ comes from a family of approx-
imately uniformly computable distributions. The probability distribution associated
with the class of context-free grammars follows an exponential-decay distribution; a
learner who (correctly) assumes that the distribution is of this form will converge to
the correct context-free grammar (Horning, 1969), but a learner assuming an arbi-
trary distribution may not. Since it is fairly clear that natural languages are more
expressive than context-free grammars, but that the actual family of distributions
(if there is one) corresponding to natural language grammars is unknown, this has
widely been taken as further evidence for the in-principle unlearnability of natural
languages without further assumptions.
The analysis in Chapter 3 appears on the surface to contradict this result by sug-
gesting that some aspects of syntactic knowledge previously argued to be innate may
actually be learnable. These ﬁndings are reconcilable because I used an actual, real-
istic dataset. The Bayesian learner there actually does assume the exponential-decay
distribution of context-free grammars – and, even though the resulting CFG only
roughly approximated English, enough was learned to support abstract inferences
previously argued to be impossible. This result depending on performing computa-
tions over sentence types rather than tokens, but this is not a drawback – it is a
prediction, and oﬀers a new way of conceptualizing the learning problem. Even if
learning entire families of languages is impossible without knowing the full nature of
the distribution in advance, it may nevertheless be true that making certain distri-
butional assumptions results in interesting learning of actual natural languages.1
This example illustrates that in a sense, ideal learnability analyses on ideal datasets
1As an aside, I can’t resist noting that it is also possible that people do make the correct dis-
tributional assumption about the grammars underlying human language, and that is why human
languages are learnable. This distribution µ, whatever it is, might not be exponential-decay (or
something else corresponding to the classes of grammars picked out by formal syntactic theories),
but it might neatly pick out exactly the class of natural languages. Indeed, some explanation along
these lines is almost inevitable – cf. Terence Deacon (1997), if people were not making the assump-
tions necessary to learn human languages, languages would not have been learned and passed on
through the generations.
196

run into the danger of “letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.” Focusing on
realistic datasets allows us to explore what is learnable from the sort of data that
people actually are presented with, and what assumptions guide that learning.
Q: These datasets don’t actually seem very realistic to me, though.
At our current state of understanding, it is impossible to have a completely realistic
dataset – even videotaped evidence needs to be encoded in some sort of usable form,
and may not reﬂect exactly what the child was attending to or noticing. All of the
choices about encoding and preprocessing, as I discuss in Chapter 2, constitute lapses
from perfect realism; but making these sorts of choices, simplifying the dataset so
that models can do something sensible and interpretable with it, is something that
every modeler must do. In fact, the point of modelling is to simplify, and to hope
that we have done so in such a way that it adds to our understanding rather than
detracts.
The important question is whether the preprocessing choices I made are such that
they render the conclusions invalid or uninteresting. In each of Chapters 3, 4, and 5,
I devoted some time to evaluating the datasets with respect to this criterion. In each
case, while the preprocessing of the datasets limits the range and generality of some
of the results, the choices made were not indefensible, nor did they presuppose the
conclusions that I do draw.
Q: Ultimately, of course, we would like to understand how real learners,
not just ideal ones, might deal with real data. How can we move from the
analyses in this thesis toward this direction?
This is a very good question. I can foresee two major steps, and many other re-
searchers are already moving in this direction. One would be to combine this sort
of ideal learning model with experiments on adults and children, with the aim of
exploring in what ways people diverge from optimality. Done properly, this sort of
analysis requires experimentation and modelling to be tightly yoked, since it is most
interesting to not simply note where this divergence occurs, but to be able to explain
197

it in modelling terms. For instance, what if adult learners do perform diﬀerently on
the datasets in Chapter 4 based on whether they are given category information or
not? This behavior is not what is found in the ideal learning model, and the next
interesting question would be to characterize exactly why. Do people have memory
or attentional biases or deﬁcits? Do they have perceptual or cognitive biases that
make them systematically ignore some possibilities, or overweight others? Do they
use heuristics (like, say, weighting features by salience) that drive their behavior?
This ties into the other step, which is modifying these ideal learning models to be
less ideal in systematic ways. It would not be diﬃcult to impose memory or processing
constraints on Bayesian models, either by adding noise to the input or “forgetting” it
in consistent ways. Diﬀerent assumptions about feature salience, biases that exclude
certain possibilities from being considered, and other heuristics can also be added.
The advantage of starting with an optimal learner and adding limitations is that it
makes clear what aspects of the behavior are due to the limitations. By yoking this
sort of modelling with experimental work on subjects, we can signiﬁcantly broaden
the set of questions we can address.
Learning on multiple levels of abstraction
Q: You keep mentioning learning higher-order constraints even before the
lower-level speciﬁc knowledge. I don’t understand how this is possible.
To be clear, the claim is not that the higher-order constraints must necessarily be
learned before any speciﬁc lower-level knowledge; it is that we cannot assume that
they must be learned later. Depending on the nature of the task and the dataset,
either may be faster than the other (Kemp et al., 2007). In Chapter 3 we saw a situa-
tion in which the higher-order abstraction T (that the corpus of child-directed speech
is better captured by a grammar with hierarchical phrase structure) was acquired
before honing on the precisely correct lower-level grammar G: at both Epochs and
Levels prior to the full corpus, CFGs were preferred even though the favored speciﬁc
grammar was diﬀerent than the best one on the full corpus. Though that model did
198

not explicitly use inferences about T to constrain inferences about G, it could have
done so, since T was learned at lower levels of evidence than were necessary to acquire
the full speciﬁc grammar or to parse complex interrogative sentences.
In fact, in Chapter 4, we do see an instance where higher-order inferences act
to constrain inferences at a lower level. That is what the shape bias is. And, as
we discovered, this higher-order generalization about feature variability emerges as
soon as there is enough lower-level information to form categories. It is not the case
that the model must wait until acquiring all of the (lower-level) category information
before it is capable of forming generalizations on a higher level.
How is it possible to learn a higher-order generalization before a lower-order one?
Although it may seem counterintuitive, there are conditions under which higher-order
generalizations should be easier to acquire for a Bayesian learner. If there are many
fewer possibilities at a higher level than at a lower level, less data may be required
to draw conclusions at the higher level. For instance, while there are inﬁnitely many
possible speciﬁc grammars G, there are only a small number of possible grammar
types T. It may thus require less evidence to identify the correct T than to identify
the correct G.
More deeply, because higher levels of abstraction consist of inferences about an
entire hypothesis, while lower levels may be relevant to only a small part, there is in a
sense much more data available about these higher levels of abstraction. For instance,
the higher level T of grammatical knowledge aﬀects the grammar of the language as a
whole while any component of G aﬀects only a small subset of the language produced.
A single sentence like adj adj n aux part contributes evidence about certain aspects of
the speciﬁc grammar G – that it is necessary to have productions that can generate
such a sequence of words – but the evidence is irrelevant to other aspects of G – for
instance, productions involving non-auxiliary verbs. In general any sentence is going
to be irrelevant (except for indirectly, insofar as it constitutes negative evidence) to
inferences about most parts of the grammar: in particular, to all of the productions
that are not needed to parse that sentence. By contrast, every sentence oﬀers at least
some evidence about the grammar type T – about whether language has hierarchical
199

or linear phrase structure – based on whether rules generated from a hierarchical or
linear grammar tend to provide a better account of that sentence. In a similar way,
every item in the world provides some evidence about whether categories in general
are organized by shape or not, but only items from a speciﬁc category provide evidence
about that categories. Higher-order generalizations may thus be learned faster simply
because there is much more evidence relevant to them.
Because of the possibility of this sort of learning, it is important to remember
that children learn individual phenomena as a part of a system of knowledge. As with
auxiliary fronting, most PoS arguments consider some isolated linguistic phenomenon
that children appear to master and conclude that because there is not enough evidence
for that phenomenon in isolation, it must be innate. I have suggested here that even
when the data does not appear to explain an isolated inference, there may be enough
evidence to learn a larger system of linguistic knowledge – a whole grammar – of
which the isolated inference is a part. To put this point another way, while it may be
sensible to ask what a rational learner can infer about language as a whole without
any language-speciﬁc biases, it is less sensible to ask what a rational learner can
infer about any single speciﬁc linguistic rule (such as auxiliary fronting). The need
to acquire a whole system of linguistic rules together imposes constraints among the
rules, so that an a priori unbiased learner may acquire constraints that are based
on the other linguistic rules it must learn at the same time.
As long as higher-
level learning is possible, it becomes necessary to explore what kinds of system-wide
inferences can be acquired.
Q: Even if higher-level learning is possible, it doesn’t seem to have espe-
cially interesting implications. After all, you haven’t removed the need for
innate knowledge; you’ve just moved it up a level.
It is deﬁnitely true that none of this analysis removes the need for innate knowledge; I
am not trying to argue against that. But “moving it up a level” accomplishes several
things. First, as the knowledge gets increasingly abstract, it also gets increasingly
simple and general. So this framework does not do away with the need for innate
200

knowledge, but it may change the nature of that knowledge. It raises the possibility
that a learner could make domain-speciﬁc inferences on higher levels of abstraction,
based on innate knowledge on even higher levels that is vague or general enough that
it is plausibly domain general. The work is not meant to show that this is always
true, but it illustrates that the simple existence of an observed higher-level inference
is not reason to conclude that it is innate; what is innate may be quite diﬀerent.
In a sense, this ﬁnding reconstructs the key intuition behind linguistic nativism,
preserving what is almost certainly right about it while eliminating some of its less
justiﬁable aspects. The basic motivation for positing innate knowledge of grammar,
or more generally innate constraints on cognitive development, is that without these
constraints, children would be unable to infer the speciﬁc knowledge that they seem to
come to from the limited data available to them. What is critical to the argument is
that some constraints are present prior to learning speciﬁc knowledge, not that those
constraints must be innate. Approaches to cognitive development that emphasize
learning from data typically view the course of development as a progressive layering
of increasingly abstract knowledge on top of more concrete representations; under
such a view, learned abstract knowledge would tend to come in after more speciﬁc
concrete knowledge is learned, so the former could not usefully constrain the latter.
This view is sensible in the absence of learning mechanisms that can explain how
abstract constraints could be learned together with (or before) the more speciﬁc
knowledge they are needed to constrain. However, this work oﬀers an alternative,
by providing just such a learning mechanism in the form of hierarchical Bayesian
models. If an abstract generalization can be acquired very early and can function as
a constraint on later development of speciﬁc knowledge, it may function eﬀectively
as if it were an innate domain-speciﬁc constraint, even if it is in fact not innate and
instead is acquired by domain-general induction from data.
Q: Are you making a general argument against innateness here?
No.
201

Q: Can you expand on that answer?
As I mentioned in the ﬁrst few pages of this thesis, the simplistic distinction between
nature and nurture is not a very constructive or interesting distinction from a scientiﬁc
point of view. Very few things in cognition are entirely due to one or the other; indeed,
feedback loops and non-linear interactions over the course of development make the
distinction almost meaningless. Even if that weren’t true, though, the interesting
question often turns on the question of domain speciﬁcity rather than innateness.
Chomsky’s argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus, considered in Chapter 3,
was used to argue for the presence of a particular kind of innate language-speciﬁc
knowledge about grammar; as we saw in Chapter 5, Baker’s Paradox was used by
Pinker to argue for the presence of particular innate language-speciﬁc semantic linking
rules and classes; and the debate in Chapter 4 critically turned on the question of
what language-speciﬁc assumptions children make about word labels.
Throughout this thesis, I formalized these debates in Bayesian terms, with the goal
of clarifying what innate knowledge must be assumed, and what form that knowledge
must take. In Chapter 3 I argued that the particular domains-speciﬁc knowledge that
has been argued to be innate – the knowledge that language has hierarchical phrase
structure – need not be: it might, in fact, be derived from more general-purpose rep-
resentational capacities and inductive biases. The learner I considered incorporates a
mechanism that trades oﬀsimplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt when evaluating hypotheses,
performs inference over type rather than token data, and encodes sentences according
to their syntactic categories. The ﬁrst two items are domain-general biases, and the
last is either learnable via domain-general mechanisms or is at least not the precise
language-speciﬁc assumption that was previously argued to be innate.
Chapter 5 was similar in many ways. There I argued, in contrast to Pinker (1989),
that innate semantic categories and linking assumptions are not necessary to solve
Baker’s Paradox. My model does make certain assumptions, most critically in the
preprocessing, since it “knows” automatically what syntactic forms correspond to
verb constructions (e.g., that NP1 V NP3 NP2 is a construction). This is domain-
202

speciﬁc, but – as before – could plausibly have been learned, and in any case is not
the precise language-speciﬁc assumption previously argued to be necessary.
One ﬁnding in Chapter 4 is that making strong innate assumptions about the role
of words does not yield diﬀerences in the nature or extent of second-order generaliza-
tion. This does not necessarily mean that those strong innate assumptions might not
be present for other reasons. It is also possible that a less ideal learner might need to
make certain innate assumptions about words, even if they are not necessary for an
ideal learner.
In all of these cases, I’m not trying to make a claim that there is no innate
knowledge, nor even that there is no innate domain-speciﬁc knowledge; I’m simply
interested in using this paradigm to be able to specify precisely what happens when
we make diﬀerent assumptions about what is built in (or not), or domain-speciﬁc (or
not).
Q: How do you identify what is domain-speciﬁc and what isn’t, and why
does this matter?
The reason it matters is that few if any cognitive scientists believe that there is liter-
ally nothing that is innate; many debates about innateness tend to boil down to the
question of whether the capacity in question is domain-general or not. For instance,
one way of framing the issue of the learnability of hierarchical phrase structure dis-
cussed in Chapter 3 is that it turns on the question of whether the innate knowledge
consists of (a) a domain-general learning mechanism (Bayesian inference) in combina-
tion with domain-general biases (to evaluate theories on the basis of type-based input)
and representational capacities (grammars), or (b) a language-speciﬁc constraint that
eliminates non-hierarchical grammars from consideration.
Any answer to this question will have two components: ﬁrst, identifying which
abilities or propensities are necessary to explain acquisition; and second, identifying
whether those abilities or propensities are domain-general or not. The latter compo-
nent is more diﬃcult than one might think: while some are obvious, others are not.
Is the bias to evaluate grammars on the basis of type-based input domain-general or
203

domain-speciﬁc? I suggest here that it may be domain-general, since one can imag-
ine may domains where it would be valuable to assume a two-component generative
process analogous to that captured by the adaptor grammar framework, in which one
component captures the “deep knowledge”, and the other captures the more super-
ﬁcial or performance-based factors that aﬀect how that deep knowledge is used to
generate data. However, it is possible that this bias is domain-speciﬁc. Ultimately,
many of these questions are only resolvable empirically. In many ways the resolution
of the question of domain speciﬁcity is far less important than the identiﬁcation of
the bias in the ﬁrst place – what matters is that it exists (or not) – and I am mostly
concerned with the latter.
The Bayesian paradigm
Q: What’s the big deal about Bayesian learning?
It’s not that Bayesian learning is the be-all and end-all of cognitive science, but the
paradigm is uniquely well-suited to address questions of learnability. As discussed in
Chapter 2 and depicted schematically in Figure 6-1, it oﬀers a unique way to study
how two fundamental questions in cognitive science interact. The question of whether
human learners have (innate) language-speciﬁc knowledge is logically separable from
the question of whether and to what extent human linguistic knowledge is based on
structured representations.
In practice, however, these issues are often conﬂated.
Within cognitive science, recent computational models of how language might be
learned have usually assumed that domain-general learning operates on representa-
tions without explicit structure (e.g., Elman et al., 1996; Rumelhart & McClelland,
1986; Reali & Christiansen, 2005). The main proponents of innate domain-speciﬁc
factors, on the other hand, have typically assumed that the representations involved
are structured (e.g.,
Chomsky, 1965, 1980; Pinker, 1984). Few cognitive scientists
have explored the possibility that explicitly structured mental representations might
be learned via domain-general mechanisms. This framework oﬀers a way to explore
this relatively uncharted territory in the context of language acquisition.
204

Figure 6-1: A schematic representation of the theoretical landscape for language
acquisition in cognitive science.
The vertical axis reﬂects the nature of the rep-
resentation. The horizontal axis reﬂects the source of inductive bias: “innate” and
“learned” are in parentheses because they are often conﬂated with “language-speciﬁc”
and “domain-general”, which I suggest is closer to the real issue. The two most promi-
nent views are represented by the two opposite shaded quadrants. I explore another
area, represented by the shaded oval. (The oval covers both sides of the horizontal
axis because this approach explores both: it is in principle possible that it could
yield results suggesting that the particular innate language-speciﬁc bias in question
is necessary).
In addition, Bayesian modelling oﬀers a normative framework for rational infer-
ence. In virtue of how it integrates statistical learning with structured representations,
the Bayesian approach can apply to questions of learnability for many diﬀerent aspects
of linguistic knowledge, not just the speciﬁc questions considered here. In addition to
domain-general inferential principles, the framework can incorporate domain-speciﬁc
information, either by specifying unique details of the representation, incorporating
biases into priors, or calculating likelihoods in some domain-speciﬁc way. Thus, it lets
us investigate the role of both domain-general and domain-speciﬁc factors in learning,
as well as the role of diﬀerent kinds of representational structure.
205

Q: How can a statistical learner perform inference as rapidly as these
models do, on the basis of relatively few examples? I thought statistical
learning was slow and gradual.
This is a common confusion. Statistical learners like associationist or connectionist
models, which operate through a process of incremental updating in response to data,
generally produce a pattern of learning that is more gradual or slow. But this pattern
is a result of the update rule, not the nature of statistical reasoning in general. As we
saw in Chapter 4, a Bayesian learner can actually make relatively strong inferences on
the basis of only a few datapoints. This is a byproduct of measuring likelihood with
respect to the size of the hypothesis space. Since each datapoint is presumed to be
independent, the likelihood of seeing n particular datapoints increases exponentially
by the size of the space. Statistical learning isn’t always slow.
Q: Doesn’t the Bayesian paradigm build the correct answer into the hy-
pothesis space? How can this be considered learning? Isn’t it actually a
pretty strong innate assumption?
I focus on this issue in some detail in Chapter 2, and I will not reiterate the entire
answer since it verges on territory that is kind of complicated and deep. The essential
point centers on the distinction between giving the model the answer and having the
answer be latent in the hypothesis space. As an example, imagine I asked you to
guess an integer. At this point you haven’t been given the answer in any meaningful
sense, even though you’ve been given the hypothesis space: the set of all integers.
In the sense that the answer is latent in the hypothesis space, you’ve been given it,
but I consider it uncontroversial that a learner should be able to represent and get to
the hypotheses it ultimately should believe. The interesting part of learning is how
the learner ﬁgures out which hypothesis is correct, out of the (potentially inﬁnite)
hypotheses it could represent.
This just touches the surface of a more complicated and interesting discussion,
and for that I refer you to Chapter 2.
206

Q: You’re being very rah-rah about the Bayesian approach. Is there any-
thing it doesn’t do well?
As I mentioned earlier, I am certainly not arguing that the Bayesian framework should
supplant other methods in cognitive science. It is an essential tool in the toolbox,
but there are many other tools as well.
Trivially, one thing the Bayesian approach doesn’t do well is tell us what actual
humans do. For that, nothing can beat experimental and observational studies. I’ve
argued that yoking modelling eﬀorts with experimental data can be especially useful,
but experimental and observational work is valuable, period.
As for other computational methods, diﬀerent methods have diﬀerent strengths
and weaknesses. I have argued that Bayesian models are particularly appropriate for
learnability issues, for all of the reasons discussed before. But if you’re interested
in, for instance, studying how diﬀerent regions of the brain (like the hippocampus
and the neocortex) might play complementary roles in memory and learning, then
connectionist models might be more appropriate (e.g., McClelland, McNaughton, &
O’Reilly, 1995). They can also be useful for studying how semantic information can
be stored in a distributed manner. Dynamical systems models are appropriate for
studying feedback loops and non-linearities over development. Which sort of approach
you should use depends on what question you’re asking.
Conclusion
Q: You’ve talked about future directions for some of the speciﬁc topics in
their respective chapters. But what do you think are the most interesting
unexplored areas that lie ahead in a more general sense?
One very exciting topic, which I’ve mentioned before at some length (and so will not
belabor too much here) is the possibility of extending Bayesian models to capture
diﬀerent ways of being non-ideal. Although I think there are still many, many ques-
tions that pure ideal learning analyses can tell us a lot about, I mention this direction
207

because I think it is qualitatively diﬀerent, and opens up a lot of future directions.
Another exciting direction is that with Bayesian models I think we can ﬁnally
start to address one of the deepest, most unresolved questions in all of cognitive
science: where we get our hypotheses and representations in the ﬁrst place. I discuss
this question at length from a more theoretical perspective in Chapter 2, but I think
recent developments in nonparametric Bayesian models can help us address them
computationally as well. These models, called “inﬁnite” because they assume that
the true underlying dimensionality is unbounded, can dynamically learn to create
additional features as learning progresses (e.g.,
Ghahramani, Griﬃths, & Sollich,
2006). Can this sort of model be used to explain how people themselves infer which
features are important for categorization or reasoning? Might we even extend the
basic idea to explore how hypothesis spaces themselves can grow?
Q: What do you think are the biggest limitations of your analyses?
I knew you’d ask that. Here is a handy list:
Chapter 3: The computational problem of searching the space of context-free gram-
mars (and, to some extent, regular grammars) is so diﬃcult that I was only able
to approximate a full search. I used many diﬀerent methods for doing this ap-
proximation – creating linguistically motivated hand-designed grammars, per-
forming a local search using them as the starting point, and performing an
automatic search from scratch – but until we can develop a procedure that we
can be sure is adequately searching the entire space, my conclusions can only
be preliminary.
Chapter 4: It is extraordinarily diﬃcult to know how to characterize the nature
of objects in categories in the world, and therefore how to map the datasets I
considered there onto the input children receive. I addressed this diﬃculty by
systematically varying the coherence of the features and the number of items
and categories in the datasets, but much remains to be done here. What if the
organization of features is entirely diﬀerent? What about larger datasets? What
208

if the choice to represent items as sets of features itself is completely oﬀbase? We
have to start from where we are – and most models and theories of categorization
have similar diﬃculties – but this is nevertheless a major shortcoming.
Chapter 5: The major problem here is similar to the problem in Chapter 4: the lim-
itations of the representation. Representing knowledge about verbs as counts of
occurrences in diﬀerent syntactic constructions has one advantage, because it
demonstrates how many phenomena in verb learning can be captured by such
a simple model; but it is nevertheless quite limited. Many of the interesting
questions in the verb acquisition literature center on the nature of the semantic
representations, which this model can say very little on (although it is somewhat
interesting that, again, it can qualitatively replicate some phenomena even mak-
ing these sparse assumptions). Future work in this area will probably depend
on expanding its representational capacity in some way.
Q: What do you think are the most important take-home messages?
This work demonstrates that one of the learnability problems, the No Negative Evi-
dence problem, is solved by a Bayesian learner – or, indeed, by any learner that trades
oﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-of-ﬁt. In Chapter 2 I explained in abstract terms
why this occurs, and in the three subsequent chapters – particularly Chapter 5 – we
saw how this principle plays out in several diﬀerent domains.
One common thread running through all of the chapters is that higher-level ab-
stract constraints may be learned at least as rapidly as lower-level speciﬁc information,
early enough to act to constrain generalization at the lower-level. This was especially
apparent in Chapters 3 and 4, and as I noted then, may in general imply that simply
noting the presence of an early higher-order constraint is not suﬃcient motivation to
assume that it is innate.
A related implication is that abstract knowledge or higher-order constraints may
be supported by an entire system of data, not just individual items. This may serve
as a cautionary warning of the perils of concluding that there is no evidence for some
higher-level inference, based on the observed lack of some individual type of data; it
209

might be that system-wide statistics of the entire dataset would support the inference,
as we see occur in Chapter 3.
In general, this research oﬀers a new perspective about what we can and can’t
conclude from standard learnability arguments, and provides a framework that allows
for an increasingly subtle, detailed, and rigorous analysis of claims about what must
or must not be innate (as well as what that even means). The framework allows
us to evaluate the bounds of “optimal” reasoning while also being able to vary with
precision how this might depend on the data, the nature of the learner’s mental
representation, and both domain-speciﬁc as well as domain-general biases (whether
due to the attentional, perceptual, memory-based, or learning mechanisms of the
child). I suggest that this approach provides an essential tool as we move toward
constructing a full and accurate picture of the human mind.

Model details from Chapter 3
Searching the space of grammars
There are two search problems, corresponding to the two ways of building or im-
proving upon our initial hand-designed grammars. The ﬁrst is to perform a fully
automated search over the space of regular grammars, and was described in the main
text and in detail in Goldwater and Griﬃths (2007). The second, described here, is
the problem of performing local search using the best hand-designed grammar as a
starting point.
Search was inspired by work by Stolcke and Omohundro (1994), in which a space
of grammars is searched via successive merging of productions; some sample merges
are shown in Table 1. Merge rules are diﬀerent for context-free and regular grammars;
this prevents a search of regular grammars from resulting in a grammar with context-
free productions.
At each stage in the search, all grammars one merge step away from the previous
grammar are created. If the new grammar has a higher posterior probability than the
current grammar, it is retained, and search continues until no grammars with higher
posterior probability can be found within one merge step away.

Prior probabilities
Non-terminals, productions, and items
The probabilities of the number of non-terminals p(n), productions p(P), and items
p(Ni) are modelled as selections from a geometric distribution. One can motivate this
distribution by imagining that non-terminals are generated by a simple automaton
with two states (on or oﬀ). Beginning in the “on” state, the automaton generates a
series of non-terminals; for each non-terminal generated, there is some probability p
that the automaton will move to the “oﬀ” state and stop generating non-terminals.
This process creates a distribution over non-terminals described by Equation 1 and
illustrated in Figure -2.
p(1 −p)n−1.
(1)
No matter the value of the parameter p, this distribution favors smaller sets: larger
values – i.e., those corresponding to more productions, non-terminals, or items – are
less probable. All reported results use p=0.5, but the qualitative outcome is identical
for a wide variety of values.
Production-probability parameters
Because each θk corresponds to the production-probability parameters for non-terminal
k, the individual parameters θ1,...,θm in each vector θk should sum to one. As is stan-
212

Figure -2: A geometric distribution, with three possible values of p.
Figure -3: The unit simplex for mk = 3 (a triangle), corresponding to the Dirichlet
distribution with α = 1 on a θk vector of production-probability parameters with
three productions.
dard in such cases, we sample each θk from the Dirichlet distribution. Intuitively, this
distribution returns the probability that the mk production-probability parameters
for non-terminal k are θ1,...,θm, given that each production has been used α−1 times.
We set α = 1, which is equivalent to having never observed any sentences and not
assuming a priori that any one sentence or derivation is more likely than another.
This therefore puts a uniform distribution on production-probability parameters and
captures the assumption that any set of parameters is as likely as any other set. In
general, drawing samples from a Dirichlet distribution with α = 1 is equivalent to
drawing samples uniformly at random from the mk −1 unit simplex; the simplex
(distribution) for mk = 3 is shown in Figure -3.
The Dirichlet distribution is continuous, which means that the probability of any
213

Figure -4: Top: one cannot compare the probability of continuous points A and C
with diﬀerent dimensionality. Bottom: when A and C correspond to discrete points,
comparison is possible.
speciﬁc θk is zero; this may seem paradoxical, but no more so than the fact that a line
of length one inch contains an inﬁnite number of zero-length points. Even though the
distribution is continuous, one can still compare the relative probability of choosing
the points from the line. For instance, consider the line in the upper part of Figure
-4. If the probability of choosing any particular point is normally distributed about
the center of the line, point A is more likely than point B. In much the same way,
it is possible to calculate the relative probability of speciﬁc θ1,...,θm, even though the
Dirichlet distribution is continuous.
However, one cannot validly compare the relative probability of choosing points
from sets with diﬀerent dimensions, as in A and C in Figure -4. Because they are
continuous, the probability of each is zero, but – unlike the previous instance – they
are not normalized by the same factor. In an analogous way, it is also invalid to
compare the probability of two speciﬁc θk of diﬀerent dimensionalities.
This poses a diﬃculty for our analysis, because our grammars have diﬀerent num-
bers of productions with the same left-hand sides, and therefore the θk are deﬁned
over diﬀerent dimensionalities. We resolve this diﬃculty by using a discrete approx-
imation of the continuous Dirichlet distribution. This is conceptually equivalent to
comparing the probability of selecting point A and point C by dividing each dimen-
sion into g discrete segments. If we split each dimension into g = 2 equally-sized
discrete segments or grids, as in the lower half of Figure -4, it becomes clear that the
grid corresponding to point A contains half of the mass of the line, while the grid
214

corresponding to C contains approximately one quarter the mass of the square. Thus,
the probability of drawing C is 25%, while A is 50%. As g approaches inﬁnity, the
relative probabilities approach the true (continuous) value.
Since drawing samples θ1,...,θm from a Dirichlet distribution is equivalent to draw-
ing samples from the mk −1 unit simplex, we calculate their probability by dividing
the simplex into identically-sized pieces. Any m −1 simplex can be subdivided into
gm−1 simplices of the same volume, where g is the number of subdivisions (grids)
along each dimension (Edelsbrunner & Grayson, 2000). If α = 1, all grids are a
priori equally probable; thus, p(θk) is given by the volume of one grid divided by the
volume of the entire simplex, that is,
1
gm−1. Production-probability parameters are
then set to the center-of-mass point of the corresponding grid.
As in the main analysis, there is a simplicity/goodness-of-ﬁt tradeoﬀwith size of
grid g. If g = 1, then vectors with many production-probability parameters have high
prior probability (each is 1.0). However, they ﬁt the data poorly: the parameters are
automatically set to the center-of-mass point of the entire simplex, which corresponds
to the case in which each production is equally likely. As g increases, the likelihood
approaches the maximum likelihood value, but the prior probability goes down. This
tradeoﬀis captured by scoring g like we do other choices.
We assign a possible
distribution of grid sizes over g by assuming that ln(g) is distributed geometrically
with parameter p = 0.5. Thus, smaller g has higher prior probability, and we can
select the grid size that best maximizes the tradeoﬀbetween simplicity and goodness-
of-ﬁt.
We evaluated each grammar with g = 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000.
The
results reported use g = 1000 because that is the value that maximizes the posterior
probability for all grammars; the hierarchical grammar type was preferred for all
values of g.
Additional complexities involved in scoring prior probability
Depending on the type of the grammar, some speciﬁc probabilities vary. The ﬂat
grammar has no non-terminals (aside from S) and thus its p(n) is always equal to 1.0.
Both the regular and context-free grammars, written in Chomsky Normal Form to
215

conform to standard linguistic usage, are constrained to either have one or two items
on the right hand side. The regular grammars have further type-speciﬁc restrictions
on what kind of item (terminal or non-terminal) may appear where, which eﬀectively
increase their prior probability relative to context-free grammars. These restrictions
aﬀect p(Ni) as well as the eﬀective vocabulary size V for speciﬁc items. For example,
the ﬁrst item on the right-hand side of productions in a regular grammar is constrained
to be a terminal item; the eﬀective V at that location is therefore smaller. A context-
free grammar has no such restrictions.
Model details from Chapter 4
Model L2: Learns overhypotheses at Level 2
Model L2, also speciﬁed in Kemp et al. (2007), is known to statisticians as a Dirichlet-
Multinomial model (A. Gelman et al., 2004), and can be written as:
α
∼Exponential(λ)
β
∼Dirichlet(µ)
θi
∼Dirichlet(αβ)
yi | ni ∼Multinomial(θi)
where ni is the number of observations for category i.
Because the model is
learning only Level 2 knowledge, I specify the Level 3 knowledge by setting parameters
λ = 1 and µ = 1, which indicates weak prior knowledge over both α and β.
This notation is ambiguous about whether categories may have multiple features
or not. If there are multiple features, inference proceeds exactly as before except that
each α and β is learned separately for each feature. The posterior probability for
the full model is therefore the product of the probabilities along each feature, which
corresponds to the assumption that each feature is independently generated. When
working with multiple features, I will use α to refer to the collection of α values along
216

all features, and β for the set of all β counts along all features.
Inference is performed by computing posterior distributions over the unknown
knowledge at the higher levels. For instance, the posterior distribution P(α, β|y)
represents a belief given the data y (the categories seen so far). I formally instantiate
this model by denoting the true distribution over features of category i as θi; thus,
if (as in Figure 4-1) the true distribution of features means the category occurs 30%
of the time with a round shape and 70% of the time with a square shape, then θi
= [0.3 0.7]. If we have observed that one item in the category is round and four are
square, then yi = [1 4]. I assume that yi is drawn from a multinomial distribution
with parameter θi, which means that the observations of the category are drawn
independently at random from the true distribution of category i. The vectors θi are
drawn from a Dirichlet distribution parameterized by a scalar α and a vector β: α
determines the extent to which each category tends to be associated with only one
feature, and β represents the distribution of features across all categories.
To ﬁt the model to data I assume that counts y are observed for one or more
categories. The goal is to compute the posterior distribution P(α, β, {θi}|y). In-
ferences about α and β can be made by drawing a sample from P(α, β|y) – the
posterior distribution on (α, β) given the observed categories. Inferences about θi,
the distribution of features for category i, can be made by integrating out α and β:
P(θi|y) =
Z
α,β
p(θi|α, β, y)p(α, β|y)dαdβ
(2)
For most of the analyses in this thesis (in both Chapters 4 and 5), this is estimated
using numerical integration via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme. The
sampler uses Gaussian proposals on log(α), and proposals for β are drawn from a
Dirichlet distribution with the current β as its mean. Four diﬀerent runs are averaged
to produce the graphs.
In order to speed up the runs in Study 2 and Extensions B and C of Study 1 in
Chapter 4, P(θi|y) there is estimated using a form of non-stochastic numerical inte-
gration in which the space of parameter values is discretized and evaluated directly.
Because the datasets themselves, being simulated, are more variable than in other
217

sections, these graphs reﬂect the averages of 24 diﬀerent runs rather than four.
Model extension: Learning category assignments
To add the ability to discover categories to Model L2, instead of assuming that the
model is given data corresponding to counts of occurrences of categories y, I assume
that the model is given data corresponding to individual items j, from which it must
infer the proper assignment of categories y. As before, the true distribution over
features of category i is denoted as θi, and the data corresponding to category i is yi.
The diﬀerence now is that the model is only given data corresponding to individual
items in the world, j, and it must decide which items belong in each category yi.
I assume that each category yi corresponds to a partition of items, and represent
this partition by a vector z. The partition of the twelve items in Figure 4-1, where
the ﬁrst four items are cups, the next ﬁve are balls, and the last three are cats, would
be represented by the vector [1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3]. The prior distribution on z is
induced by the Chinese Restaurant Process:
P(zj = c|z1, . . . , zj−1) =



ni
j−1+γ
ni > 0
γ
j−1+γ
i is a new category
(3)
where zj is the category assignment for item j, ni is the number of items previously
assigned to category i, and γ is a hyperparameter which captures the degree to which
the process favors simpler category assignments (I set γ = 1). The Chinese Restaurant
Process prefers to assign items to categories that already have many members, and
therefore tends to prefer partitions with fewer categories.
If z is known, this model reduces to several independent versions of Model L2,
and predictions can be computed using the techniques described in the last section.
Since z is unknown, we integrate over each of the possible category partitions z:
P(θi|y) =
X
z
P(θi|y, z)P(z|y)
(4)
where P(z|y) ∝P(y|z)P(z) and P(z) is the prior induced by the CRP pro-
218

cess. For Model L2, computing P(y|z) reduces to the problem of computing several
marginal likelihoods
P(y′) =
Z
α,β
P(y′|α, β)P(α, β)dαdβ
(5)
which is estimated by drawing 10,000 samples from the prior P(α, β).
Model details from Chapter 5
This chapter considered two models. Model L2 is the model introduced in Chapter
4 and speciﬁed in Kemp et al. (2007) and earlier in this appendix. L3 performs
inference over another level of overhypotheses, learning not only overhypotheses α
and β, but also overhypotheses on em those overhypotheses, denoted by parameters
λ and µ, respectively.
Model L3: Learns overhypotheses at Level 2 and 3
The Level 3 model is quite similar to the Level 2 model, except that instead of
assuming that λ and µ are known, we learn those as well. In statistical notation, it
can be written2:
λ
∼Exponential(1)
µ
∼Exponential(1)
α
∼Exponential(λ)
β
∼Dirichlet(µ)
θi
∼Dirichlet(αβ)
yi | ni ∼Multinomial(θi)
where ni is the number of observations for verb i.
2Note that µ is a scalar, but in order for it to be a proper hyperparameter for the vector β, it is
vectorized: µ = µ1.
219

As before, inference is performed by computing posterior distributions over the
unknown knowledge at the higher levels. The only diﬀerence is that the posterior
distribution is given by P(λ, µ, α, β, {θi}|y). Inferences about λ,µ,α, and β can be
made by drawing a sample from P(α, β, λ, µ|y), which is given by:
P(α, β, λ, µ|y) ∝P(y|α, β)P(α|λ)P(β|µ)P(λ)P(µ)
(6)
Inferences about θi, which in this case correspond to the distribution of construc-
tions for verb i, can be made by integrating out α, β, λ, and µ:
P(θi|y) =
Z
α,β,λ,µ
P(θi|α, β, y)P(α, β, λ, µ|y)dαdβdλdµ
(7)
This is estimated using numerical integration via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) scheme. The sampler uses Gaussian proposals on log(α), log(λ), and log(µ);
as before, proposals for β are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution with the current β
as its mean. Four diﬀerent runs are averaged to produce the graphs, except in the
case of Study 3 where, since the results were more variable, eight runs are included.
Model extension: Learning verb classes
The procedure for discovering verb classes is somewhat analogous to the procedure
for learning item categories, introduced in Chapter 4 and explained elsewhere in
this appendix. The diﬀerence is that learning item categories involves clustering on
the level of speciﬁc items (Level 1), whereas learning verb classes (or, equivalently,
ontological kinds) involves clustering on a more abstract level, Level 2. To add the
ability to discover verb classes to both Models L2 and L3, I assume that verbs may
be grouped into classes, each of which is associated with its own hyperparameters.3
For Model L2, this means that there is a separate αc and βc for each class c inferred
by the model; for Model L3, there is a separate αc, βc, λc, and µc for each class c.
In both cases, the model partitions the verbs into one or more classes. Each possible
3This extension for Model L2 is presented in Kemp et al. (2007); though it is referred to learning
ontological kinds rather than learning verb classes, the model itself is equivalent. Here I extend the
same idea to Model L3.
220

partition can be represented by a vector z. A partition of six verbs in which the ﬁrst
three verbs are in one class and the last three were in another can be represented
by the vector [1 1 1 2 2 2]. The prior distribution on z is induced by the Chinese
Restaurant Process:
P(zi = c|z1, . . . , zi−1) =



nc
i−1+γ
nc > 0
γ
i−1+γ
c is a new class
(8)
where zi is the class assignment for verb i, nc is the number of verbs previously
assigned to class c, and γ is a hyperparameter which captures the degree to which
the process favors simpler class assignments (I set γ = 1). The Chinese Restaurant
Process prefers to assign verbs to classes that already have many members, and
therefore tends to prefer partitions with fewer classes.
The extension for Model L3 can now be written as follows:
z
∼CRP(γ)
λc
∼Exponential(1)
µc
∼Exponential(1)
αc
∼Exponential(λc)
βc
∼Dirichlet(µc)
θi
∼Dirichlet(αciβci)
yi | ni ∼Multinomial(θi)
The equivalent extension for Model L2 is trivially derivable from this.
If z is known, the extended model reduces to several independent versions of
the basic (L2 or L3) model, and predictions can be computed using the techniques
described in the last section. Since z is unknown, we must integrate over each of the
possible class partitions z:
P(θi|y) =
X
z
P(θi|y, z)P(z|y)
(9)
221

where P(z|y) ∝P(y|z)P(z) and P(z) is the prior induced by the CRP pro-
cess. For Model L2, computing P(y|z) reduces to the problem of computing several
marginal likelihoods
P(y′) =
Z
α,β
P(y′|α, β)P(α, β)dαdβ
(10)
which I estimate by drawing 10,000 samples from the prior P(α, β).
For model L3, computing P(y|z) reduces to computing
P(y′) =
Z
α,β,λ,µ
P(y′|α, β)P(α, β|λ, µ)P(λ, µ)dαdβdλdµ
(11)
which is also estimated by drawing 10,000 samples, this time from the joint prior
P(α, β|λ, µ)P(λ, µ).
Corpus of dative verbs
The data of verb counts is collected from the sentences spoken by adults in the Adam
corpus (Brown, 1973) of the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), and consists
of all instances of each of the dative verbs listed in Levin (1993), including the number
of occurrences in each construction (PD and DOD). Epochs correspond to the counts
for verbs in subsections of the corpus of 55 ﬁles, split by age (Epoch 1 is the ﬁrst 11
ﬁles, Epoch 2 is the ﬁrst 22, and so on).
