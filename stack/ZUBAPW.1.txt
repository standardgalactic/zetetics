A PRESENTATION WITHOUT AN EXAMPLE? 
by Arnold Zuboff 
Analysis, Vol. 52, No. 3. (Jul., 1992), pp. 190-191. 
IN A DREAM someone said to me, 'Any general thesis which is put forward without a concrete 
example is therein badly presented'. That was all he said, and I was about to point out the irony that 
in merely putting forward this thesis by means of a general statement the speaker had failed his own 
requirement of providing an example when it suddenly occurred to me, as I exclaimed to him, 'Ah, I 
see. Your putting forward this thesis without an example is itself the concrete example'. But when I 
awoke I realized there was a problem here. If indeed the speaker is credited with having given me a 
concrete example of an example-less bad presentation, then that credit must be immediately with- 
drawn, because what he has given me is not an example of an example-less bad presentation. But if 
it is not an example, then it must once again be received as an example of example-less 
presentation, but then it once again is not an example, and so on forever.  
This is another paradox of inclusion, like Russell's paradox. What I think may make this one especially 
interesting is that it could turn out to be resistant to certain popular treatments of such paradoxes. 
This paradox arises involving natural predicates in a natural expression of a natural - if somewhat 
exaggerated - thesis.'
