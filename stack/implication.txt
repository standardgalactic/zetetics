Implication – Conditional Statement
p →q (p implies q) (if p then q) is the 
proposition that is false when p is true and 
q is false and true otherwise.
Equivalent to “not p or q”
Ex. 
If I am elected then I will lower the taxes
If you get 100% on the final then you will get 
an A
p: I am elected
q: I will lower the taxes
Think of it as a contract, obligation or pledge
The contract is breached (implication is false) 
only if the p is true and q is false. 
Otherwise the contract (the pledge) is valid 
(true)

1.1.2

p →q (p implies q)
p: hypothesis, premise, antecedent
q: conclusion, consequence
p and q do not have to be related
If 2+2 = 4 then Albany is the capitol of N.Y.  (T)
If 2+2 = 4 then Peapack is the capitol of N.J.  (F)
If 2+2 = 5 then there is a state with only one neighbor 
(T)
If 2+2 = 5 then you are the pope 
Also (T)

• Different forms for implications
p implies q   is equivalent to
If p then q 
q if p
q whenever p
q when p
q follows from p
p is sufficient for q
a sufficient condition for q is p
q is necessary for p
a necessary condition for p is q
p only if q

1.1.4
A. Elgammal – CS205  Rutgers
p →q (p implies q)
p is sufficient for q
a sufficient condition for q is p
q is necessary for p
a necessary condition for p is q
Ex. 
If you get 100% on the final you  will get an A
You get 100% on the final is sufficient to get an A
A sufficient condition to get an A is to get 100% on the 
final 
You get an A is necessary for you to get 100% on the 
final (but not sufficient)
A necessary condition for you get 100% is you get an A
(imagine that  you know your letter grade and  you are 
trying to guess your grade in the final:
If you didn’t get A then for sure you didn’t get 100%
If you get A then you may or may not get 100% )

1.1.5
A. Elgammal – CS205  Rutgers
p →q (p implies q)
p is sufficient for q
a sufficient condition for q is p
q is necessary for p
a necessary condition for p is q
If you show up on Monday you will get the job
You show up on Monday is sufficient for you to get the 
job
A sufficient condition for you to get the job is to show 
up on Monday
You get the job is necessary for you have shown up on 
Monday.
A necessary condition for you have shown up on 
Monday is you got the job.

• You walk 8 miles is necessary to get to the 
top
Which is equivalent ?
If you walk 8 miles then you get to the top
If you got to the top then you have walked 8 
miles 
The first statement is not equivalent. Walking 
8 miles is necessary (but other things might 
be also necessary). suppose you walked 8 
miles in the wrong direction ! But if you 
got to the top then you are sure that you 
must have walked 8 miles.

• Contrapositive 
The contrapositive of “if p then q” is 
“if not q then not p”
The contrapositive of  
p →q is  ¬ q →¬ p 
A conditional statement is logically 
equivalent to its contrapositive.
Proof by truth table.
Ex. If today is Easter then tomorrow is 
Monday
Contrapositive:
If tomorrow is not Monday then today is not 
Easter

1.1.8
A. Elgammal – CS205  Rutgers
• If p then q   (p →q )
• The converse is “ If q then p”
q →p 
• The inverse is “If not p then not q”
¬ p →¬ q 
• The contrapositive “if not q then not p”
¬ q →¬ p 
Ex. If today is Easter then tomorrow is Monday
Converse:  If tomorrow is Monday then today is Easter
Inverse: If today is not Easter then tomorrow is not 
Monday
Conditional statement is not equiv. to its converse
Conditional statement is not equiv. to its inverse
The converse and inverse are logically equivalent.

1.1.9
A. Elgammal – CS205  Rutgers
• p only if q  means “if not q then not p”
By contrapositive this is equivalent to “if p 
then q”
Ex:
If you get 100% on the final then you will get an A
Which statement is equivalent ?
-
you will get A only if you get 100% on the final
-
You get 100% on the final only if you get an A
The first statement is not equivalent to our statement: 
according to our statement you can get  A even if 
you don’t get 100% on the final.

•
Your guarantee is good only if you bought 
your CD player less than 90 days ago
Which statement is equivalent ?
1. if you bought your CD player less than 90 
days ago then your guarantee is good
2. If your guarantee is good then you have 
bought your CD player less than 90 days 
ago
3. You bought your CD player less than 90 
days ago is sufficient for the guarantee to 
be good.
4. You bought your CD player less than 90 
days ago is necessary for the guarantee to 
be good.
1 and 3 are not equivalent .. Why ?

The biconditional   p ↔q  is the proposition 
that is true when p and q have the same 
truth values, and is false otherwise.
Biconditional is equivalent to two way 
implication:
p ↔q ≡p →q ∧q →p
p →q : if p then q 
: p only if q
q →p : if q then p
: p if q
p ↔q : p if and only if q
or,
p ↔q : p iff q
: q iff p

1.1.12
A. Elgammal – CS205  Rutgers
p ↔q ≡p →q ∧q →p
p →q : p is sufficient condition for q
q →p : p is necessary condition for q
p ↔q : p is necessary and sufficient 
condition for q
Or, since p ↔q ≡q ↔p , 
q is necessary and sufficient condition for p

Ex:
This program is correct if, and only if, it produces the 
correct answer for all possible sets of input data.
This is equivalent to:
If this program is correct, then it produces the correct 
answer for all possible sets of input data
and
if it produces the correct answer for all possible sets of 
input data then this program is correct.
This is equivalent to:
This program is correct is necessary and sufficient 
condition for it to produce correct answer for all 
possible sets of input data.
This is also equivalent to:
This program produces the correct answer for all 
possible sets of input data is necessary and sufficient 
condition for the program to be correct
