International Context 
 2011 Progress in International Reading Literacy 
Study (PIRLS):   

•Focus on reading comprehension 
 and home and school literacy 
environments 
•45 countries assessed 4th- 5th grade 
children and administered parental and 
school principal questionnaires 
 
•Average age of USA children = 10.2 
years  
•12, 726 US children assessed, 370 
schools 
•Children with disability or language 
barriers excluded (6.5%)

Effective classroom practices 
What classroom 
practices are 
effective in 
facilitating young 
children’s learning? 

Effective Teaching 
• Monitor development and adapt instruction to 
meet individual needs. 
• Expect success in all children 
• Integral parental involvement 
• Well supported by educators/health care workers 
with specialist knowledge when required. 
• Strong instructional leadership 
  
 
 
 
 
(Foorman et al 2006) 
 

Instructional approaches that have a 
significant positive effect on children’s 
learning (Hattie, 2005) 
  
•
Teacher feedback (effect size, 0.81); 
•
Direct instructional approaches (0.81); 
•
Phonological awareness (0.66); 
•
Early intervention (0.66); 
•
Peer assessment strategies (0.63); 
•
Self assessment strategies (0.56); 
•
Setting challenging goals (0.59); and 
•
Mastery learning approaches (0.55) 
 
 
Quality professional development for teachers 
also has a positive influence (effect size 0.48)

School Reading

Phonological awareness is a    
powerful predictor of early            
reading success 
( see Gillon, 2004     
for a review)

Effective practices 
  
 
 
 
 

• Developing young  children’s phoneme 
awareness knowledge will help facilitate 
their knowledge of letter sound 
relationships 

Practical implications: integrated model may 
be most efficient: Teach letter name, letter 
sound and PA concurrently

“Invented spelling” strategies reinforce 
children’s spelling errors and have little value 
in advancing children’s reading and spelling 
development 

Invented spelling (with feedback) can help children 
understand the link between speech and print 
when reading and spelling 
 
•
Say the word drawn out: exaggerated 
articulation 
•
Encourage children to write the sounds they 
hear in the word (integrate phonological and 
orthographic cues) 
•
Provide scaffold  individual feedback- closer 
approximation to correct spelling

on learning to read in low-phoneme awareness kindergartners: a 
randomized-control-trial study." Reading and Writing 25(4): 917-934.

writing.

Bilingual or multilingual speakers will be 
at a disadvantage in their development of 
phonological awareness in English 

Wren, Y., H. Hambly, et al. (2013). "A review of the impact of 
bilingualism on the development of phonemic awareness skills in 
children with typical speech development." Child Language 
Teaching & Therapy 29(1): 11-25. 
 
 
• PA skills transfer across languages 
• Evidence does not suggest disadvantage. 
Bilingual children either do not differ from 
monolingual children or bilingual children 
may have an advantage – depends on 
languages being learned 
Clinical idea: Use words from the children’s  native or other 
language alongside English words in phonological 
awareness , reading and spelling activities.

Intensive intervention to improve young 
children's knowledge of rhyme will 
significantly improve their reading ability 

Nancollis, Lawrie, Dodd et al. (2005). "Phonological awareness 
intervention and the acquisition of literacy skills in children from 
deprived social backgrounds." Language Speech and Hearing 
Services in Schools 36(4): 325-335.. 
 
 
A 9- week programme 
that focused on rhyme 
and syllable awareness 
for preschool British 
children had little effect  
on improving later 
literacy development 
 
 
Implication: focus predominantly at 
the phoneme level

Initial Phoneme Identity  

• It is more effective to integrate phonological 
awareness activities with speech production 
goals for children with speech sound disorder 
than working on speech goals only 

(G. Gillon, 2000, 2002, 2005) 
Integrated intervention that targets speech 
production, letter sound knowledge and 
phoneme awareness can lead to improved 
 
• speech articulation  
 
• phoneme awareness 
 
• reading and spelling development  
 
compared to therapy that focuses only on 
speech production goals

Drawing young children's’ attention to print and 
sounds in words during shared book reading can 
be distracting for the child and has  little added 
benefit. 

Piasta, S. B., L. M. Justice, et al. (2012). "Increasing Young Children's Contact 
With Print During Shared Reading: Longitudinal Effects on Literacy 
Achievement." Child Development 83(3): 810-820. 
Teachers  use of print referencing techniques during 
shared book reading on a regular basis has superior 
long term benefits for children’s reading development  
compared to reading the story only.

Children with severe speech disorders (e.g., 
apraxia of speech) can benefit from relatively 
short periods of phonological awareness 
instruction (e.g between 20 – 25 hours of 
intervention over a 3 month period)

integrated phonological awareness approach for children with 
childhood apraxia of speech (CAS)." Child Language Teaching & 
Therapy 25(3): 341-366. 
Nine  from 12 children with CAS (aged 4- 7 
yrs) showed significant gains in:  
 
phonological awareness 
speech targets  
Letter sound knowledge 
 
following two 6-week blocks of intervention (24 
hrs total).

Spelling Sensitivity System  
(Apel and Masterson, 2010) 
‘Developmental’ approach to 
assessing spelling 
Gives credit for representation 
of phonological, morphological 
and orthographic information 
Separate the spelling item into 
its elements (phonemes, affixes) 
and a score assigned 
◦Conventional = 3 points 
◦Plausible = 2 points 
◦Implausible and incorrect = 1 point 
◦Omitted = 0 points

Key Findings 
 
• Classroom phonological awareness instruction delivered by 
teachers can be beneficial for literacy development. 
• Percentage of at-risk students can be minimized by 6-years of 
age. 
• A short intensive burst can result in significant and maintained 
benefits for reading and spelling. 
• Children with spoken language difficulties can  
 
benefit from classroom PA instruction- their reading and spelling 
accelerated to the level of their peers with TD peers who did not 
receive classroom PA but they may need more assistance in 
transferring skills to reading and spelling activities.

Initial Phoneme Identity: 
• “Here is my friend Frog. Frog starts with the/f/ 
sound.  Joey  please take a card from the magic hat.  
Ah you found a boat.  Let’s listen to the first sound 
in boat.  Boat starts with a /b/ sound.  Do Frog and 
boat start with the same sound?"

Key research questions 
1.
What are the key components of culturally responsive special 
education practice? 
2.
What are the key components of evidence-based special 
education practice? 
Culturally Responsive Evidence Based Practice 

 
Research 
Practitioner 
skills &  
knowledge 
Whānau wisdom & 
values 

“Cultural competence is the acquisition of skills so that 
we are better able to understand members of other 
cultures in order to achieve best outcomes….it is 
about being able to understand the people who we 
are going to work with, as practitioners…” 
                           
                                                      (Durie, July 2003; page 2.) 
 
Why is it important to be  
culturally competent? 

Culturally Responsive practice.... 
Cultural safety:   
relationship 
between SLP and 
Child- child 
focused 
Cultural competency: 
practitioner focused, 
Respecting cultural 
difference  
Culturally responsive practices 
Understanding significance of 
cultural practices 
Promotes respect for cultural 
diversity 

Four components………. 
a)
The awareness, knowledge and perspectives that one 
brings to a particular context or setting  
b)
The processes that are utilised (i.e. the ways we 
engage / interact, and communicate with whānau) 
c)
How we assess and analyse: making meaning, drawing 
inferences, interpreting what is happening 
d)
The programme planning / interventions that are 
subsequently put in place 
 
What informs how we work?

Discussion 
How can you demonstrate culturally 
responsive practices in your educational 
context? 
 
What are facilitators and barriers to 
culturally responsive practices? 

Early reading success: 
Core to education success. 

But… early reading success is just 
the beginning………
