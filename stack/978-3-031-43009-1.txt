Introduction 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a federal agency, and 
it publishes Secure Hash Algorithms, a member of the family of encrypted hash 
functions [1]. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), inclusive SHA-0, 
SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. In which SHA-256 of SHA-2 family was designed by 
the National Security Agency (NSA) to serve as cryptographic Digital Signature 
Algorithm and is certiﬁed with FIPS PUB 180–4, CRYPTREC and NESSIE [2]. 
A cryptographic algorithm called SHA-256 converts data with variable lengths to 
data with ﬁxed lengths [3]. The input is of variable length i.e.; “N” 512 blocks and 
each block is of size 512 bit.The “N” 512 bit input must be less than 264 bits [3]. The 
resultant length of SHA-256 is of 256 bit. This 256 bit is called as a hash or message 
digests [4]. The ﬁnal hash acts as a digital signature in cryptographic security, and 
cryptocurrency. 
This paper proposes few optimization techniques in the architecture of SHA-256 
hash algorithm namely addition of independent variables in the message compression 
function and addition of independent variables in the message scheduler function for 
improving hashing algorithm to minimize the critical path and to achieve less area 
utilization, power consumption and cells count that improves the performance of 
SHA-256 design [5].

Normative SHA-256 System Architecture 
Initial hash values A[0], B[0], C[0], D[0], E[0], F[0], G[0], H[0] are given by NSTand 
each of size 32 bit SHA-256 constants K[0], K[1], …, K[63] are given by NST and 
each of size 32 bit as shown in Fig. 1. The SHA-256 consists of a main module and 
two sub modules like message scheduler & message compression [6]. The message 
scheduler performs the message scheduling operations and message compression 
performs the message compression operations [7]. These are discusssed in detail in 
Sects. 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. 
SHA-256 was published by NIST and they proposed a set of 8 initial hashes 
(words) A[0], B[0], C[0], D[0], E[0], F[0], G[0], H[0] and they proposed also 
proposed a set of 64 constants (words) K [0], K[1]…K [63]. SHA-256 uses sixty-four 
constant 32-bit words, K[0], K[1], K[2], …, K[63] as shown in Fig. 2. These words 
represent the ﬁrst thirty-two bit words of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the 
ﬁrst sixty-four prime numbers [8].
These words are constants in hex and are (left to right). 
SHA-256 needs an input of “N” 512 bits where “N” 512 < 264as shown in Figs. 3 
and 4. Let’s say the input passed is M bits. The algorithm needs to be pre-processed 
before it is passed as input to SHA-256 Algorithm [9]. Preprocessing includes three 
sub-steps which are the following.
• The input message was padded, M
• Blocking the message for parsing
• A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are the initial hash values that are set. 
(Refer to Fig. 3)

2.1 
Padding the Input Message (M) 
In order to ensure that the padded input message, M, is multiple of 512 bits with 
respect to SHA-256, padding is required. Assume that the message M is composed

4
B. Srikanth et al.
Fig. 5 Padding of input message 
of l bits of “1” data up until the end of the message, followed by k bits of zero data, 
where k is the lowest, a positive solution to the equation l + 1 + k = 448 mod 512. 
Then add the 64-bit block that corresponds to the binary version of the number l 
expression [10]. For instance, the (8-bit ASCII) message “abc” is padded with one 
bit, 448 − (24 + 1) = 423 zero bits, and then the message length to create a 512-bit 
padded message because 8 * 3 = 24 is the message’s length [11]. 
Now, as illustrated in Fig. 5, the length of the padded message should be a multiple 
of 512 bits. 
2.2 
Parsing the Padded Input 
The padded message of the above step must be parsed into N 512-bit blocks. 
Now, the message after pre-processing stage is fed to Message Compression 
Function [12] as shown in Fig. 6. The three main tasks to be performed after pre-
processing are the following. 
• Message Scheduler Function.
• Message Compression Function.
• Intermediate Hash Function.

2.3 
Message Scheduling Function 
Each padded input message block, M (1), M (2) … M (N) is sent to Message 
Scheduling Function [13]. In message scheduling algorithm we need schedules of 
W[0] to W[63]. Let the M (1) be the only pre-processed input of 512 bit and it is sent 
into W[0], W[1] … W[15] as shown in Fig. 7. 
Design now needs to generate W[16] to W[63]. This task is done by message 
scheduler [14] as shown in Figs. 8 and 9.
2.4 
Mechanism of Message Compression 
The register contents were changed to implement the message compression function 
[15]. 
The eight initial hashes proposed by NIST A[O], B[O], C[O], D[O], E[O], F[O], 
H[O] (refer to Fig. 3) are stored in eight 32-bit shift registers A[ii], B[ii], C[ii], D[ii],

Fig. 10, i.e.; ii variable runs for 64 times generating the following Figs. 11, 12, 13, 
14, and 15. 
The generation of newA is the critical path in this core.

2.5 
Intermediate Hash Generation 
For variable, ii = 0; A[ii] turns to be A[0] which is our initial hash is passed to B[ii 
+ 1] = B[1] = newB and in next round A[1] is passed to B[2]. Similar operation is 
done on newC, newD, newF, newG, newH as shown in Fig. 16.

In this way for 64 rounds, i.e.; 0 < = ii < = 63 we get A[1] to A[64], B[1] to  
B[64], …., H[0] to H[64]. 
Final hash = concatenation. 
(A[O] + A[64], B[O] + B[64], C[O] + C[64], D[O] + D[64], E[O] + E[64], 
F[O] + F[64], G[O] + G[64], H[O] + H[64]) as shown in Fig. 17.

Improved SHA-256 System Architecture 
3.1 
Proposed Work 
1. USAGE OF CARRY SAVE ADDER (CSA): The creation of newA variables for 
each round of the compression function is, as was previously said, the critical step 
in the SHA256 design. This involves modulo addition of 2 w (w = 32 bit) on seven 
variables, they are H[ii], k[ii], W[ii], sumA, maj, ch, sumE. 
Usage of Carry Save Adders, lessen the delay caused by the propagation time 
of carry by separating the generation routes of sum and the carry. CSA accept 3 
operands as inputs and so, the working variable A can be computed using just 5 CSA 
as shown in Figs. 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.
So, in the design every modulo addition 2 w is now replaced with a carry save 
adder (CSA). 
4 
Reducing 3 Adders to 2 Adders in Message Scheduling 
In the Fig. 8, the addition of W[i-15] = q and W[i-14] = s are independent to 
each other and also to the message scheduling function. The modiﬁed architecture 
proposes to add W[i-15] and W[i-14] before passing to the message scheduling 
function (sub-module) wordaddm. This brings a hardware reduction of adders in the 
message scheduler stage as shown in Fig. 23.

Reducing 11 Adders to 5 Adders in Message Compression 
In the Fig. 10, the addition of H[ii], W[ii], K [ii] are independent to each other and 
also to the message compression function. The modiﬁed architecture proposes to add 
W [ii], H[ii] and K [ii] before passing to the message compression() sub-module. This 
brings a hardware reduction of adders in the message compression stage as shown

Introduction 
In current scenario, as ﬁrms expand their ad campaigns to include mobile phone 
and internet promotions, there is a necessity for a knowledge on a commercial 
acquaintance outline that isn’t limited to television advertising as well as other social 
networking sites. Social networking users pay monetary beneﬁts to display an adver-
tising in their websites and their platforms [1]. In the same way alongside other 
content on the websites when they visit them. For millions of individuals all around 
the world. Now a days social networking sites in websites has paly a vital role 
and its impact on attitude of the consumers are more which intern to impact on 
decision making of the consumers [2]. The primary social networking sites such as 
six degree.com as well as myspace, LinkedIn and other popular social networking 
site Facebook…etc. which are tolerates the users to develop their own proﬁles and 
their separate interface with exiting and modern contracts, users can also their views 
and knowledge sharing through this social networking sites popularity has been 
increase, know it is considers as a subdivision of social media [3]. Professional 
website elements like as graphical information, color-coded pertinent data, and audio 
communication boost website accessibility, and the bulk of these features are found in 
almost every Networking site. Social networking sites have facilitated consumer-to-
consumer communication and enabled customer-brand engagement [4]. As a result 
of society’s rapid acceptance of social media, social interacting blogs has become an 
integral component of modern life. Advertisements on social networking sites have

given advertisers access to a new network via which they may communicate with 
their target demographic clients. In social media two types of marketing strategies are 
more popular such as Facebook and twitter in addition to this YouTube is also one of 
the popular social networking platforms in order to sharing the videos. In second the 
paid network media such as advertising through Facebook and advertising through 
the blogs. Nevertheless, according to Nielsen, social networking sites has renowned 
and it has free tools has popularity in order to promote the products through the social 
networking platforms [5].

Review of Literature 
The revolutionary of social networking sites impact has been increases and this 
networking sites marketing strategies not only gives an exclusive phase to the compa-
nies for to promote the company products and services. But also considered this 
social media platform as a tool for seeing the customer suggestions and feedbacks. 
A. A. Alalwan is a writer who lives in the United Arab Emirates (2018). According 
to Maclaran and Catterall, virtual community research is important because of the 
growing number of participation clusters scheduled the Cyberspace, and discussion 
forums, which are often market orientated, can provide excellent understandings for 
vendors [6]. This social networking sites affords sharing the electronic information 
and also Offred the to maintain long lasting connections. In social networking sites 
scenario, most of the companies are using social media in the form of online as 
well as ofﬂine, they are developing a unique Facebook group in ordered to promote 
their products through the social media platforms such as Facebook in accumulation 
to the banner advertisings [7]. This main purpose of this social networking sites 
is providing updated information about the products or services and proving the 
videos with regards initiation of the products and services as well as information 
with regards the unique promotional deals. The main aim of the social networking 
sites is to provide information as well as marketing communication which are Offred 
by the organizations marketing strategies are more popular such as Facebook and 
twitter in addition to this YouTube is also one of the popular social networking 
platforms in order to sharing the videos. In second the paid network media such as 
advertising through Facebook and advertising through the blogs. Social networking 
sites clients’ users and followers of speciﬁc companies are encouraged to take part in 
frequent conversations on these followers networking sites which are help develop a 
community where people can share their customer engagement with each other [8]. 
The company’s SNAs became viral as a result. The major goal of using social 
networks for advertising reasons is to build brand recognition, as per the report gave 
by the Nielson in the year of 2013, Venders have underway allocating particular 
budgets aimed at sponsored social media marketing, according to the report, and 
want to increase the expenditure in the future years [9]. Marketers may utilize social

media to develop relationships with current and potential customers, as well as create 
communities where people can cooperate to solve problems (2013). Experts argue 
that social networking platforms, which are used by millions of people from all 
over the world from different republics, various languages, and from the various 
demographical factors, its strength be a good place to promote. 
Because of marketers utilize both free and paid techniques to promote their prod-
ucts on social media sites, it’s crucial to ﬁgure out which features of these ads get 
the most attention from users [10]. The inclination to respond positively or nega-
tively to a highlight that is rising throughout a certain exposure event is referred to 
as attitude toward advertisement. Both social networking sites and marketers’ proﬁt 
from these adverts. The attitude and behaviour as well as behavioral intention of the 
consumers are having inter connected [11]. In this way this social networking sites 
will more impact on attitude and it also inﬂuence on behavior of the consumers. 
Recognizing users’ attitudes toward SNAs on social networking sites is critical for 
both marketers and SNS managers. In order to determining the effectiveness and 
impact of attitude on behavioral intention of the various advertisings in social media 
and advertising studies. As per current scenario these two are plays a major goal in 
advertising research. 
Promotional messages may spread via electronic word-of-mouth if people have 
a positive attitude toward social networking sites (e-WOM). The social networking 
sites as well as blogs are are using by the clients in various category in the form 
of sharing the positive views with respect to products and services [12]. Ballantine 
has found that well-adjusted blog assessments are professed as the most trustworthy, 
and credible reviews resulted in the top scores on brand attitude and buy intention. 
Individuals’ interactions and connections with one another, sharing similar interests, 
participating in discussion forums, and sharing their opinions have all changed as a 
result of social networking sites. Consumers’ attitudes and behaviour toward products 
and services are inﬂuenced through word of mouth, which is the exchange of adver-
tising messages among customers. According to Lorenz, the television can inﬂuence 
client purchase decisions at any point in the process. According to studies, social 
media networks like Facebook can help determine client purchase intent. As a result, 
brand advertisers must design and implement a ﬂawless strategy while building social 
networking sites in order to elicit buy intent from social networking manipulators 
engaging social networking-based advertisings for any branded products [13, 14]. 
To reach their target market, brand managers employ a range of mediums. Social 
networking sites afford to the vendors with a reliable stage for appealing with social 
networking sites operators and communicating the brand’s fundamental message 
[15]. Promotion should increase client perceptions of the organisation and its prod-
ucts, inspire behavioral responses such as positive word-of-mouth, and elicit a desire 
to buy. M. Ali and S. A. Raza, to elicit such psychological—behavioral responses, 
advertising should offer information that is relevant or appropriate to the promoted 
brand, fun and compelling to watch or read, and reliable enough for people to trust

[16]. The current study has demonstrated that the impact of social networking adver-
tisements varies based on the stage of a user’s purchase decision making, when they 
are buying a product or service from various social media networks [17, 18].

Objectives of the Study
• To identify the inﬂuence of social networking sites (SNS) on consumer attitude.
• To measure the inﬂuence of social media or social networking sites on consumer 
at different stages of purchase.
• To know Demographical Impact on purchase Intention of the consumers.

Signiﬁcancy of the Study 
Considering the purposes of the research, performing the investigation from the 
consumer’s perspective would be the best strategy. This study is being carried out 
by the researcher in order to assist customers in determining the reasons why social 
media inﬂuenced their purchasing decisions. Because the primary goal of marketing 
is to analyses the demands of the consumer, the data acquired through the question-
naire is from the consumer’s perspective in order to identify fresh insights. The study 
also intends to assist potential readers comprehend the role of social media websites/ 
apps in consumer decision-making. The study is majorly emphasized on end-user 
behaviour.

Research Methodology 
In research methodology, we not only discuss methodological approaches, but also 
the logic behind methodologies we use in the content of our research study and explain 
why we are using a particular method or technique; thus, in this investigation, we will 
look at various steps that are commonly used in studying and the logic behind them. 
It’s a high-level overview of the study’s methodology and procedures. The study used 
a descriptive research approach. Surveys and different forms of fact-ﬁndings were 
examples of descriptive data. A statistical measure for determining the correlation or 
co-relationship between two variables is correlation. Regression is the study of how 
to link an independent variable to a dependent variable statistically.

A self-administered questionnaire survey based on the ﬁndings of the literature 
review was created to achieve the study’s purpose. Following the pre-test, the ques-
tionnaire was improved. The survey was organized into four sections, each dealing 
with a distinct topic: Tsiros et al. identiﬁed two types of media: (1) social media, and 
(2) traditional media (advertising).

Data Analysis 
For social sciences, a statistical software is available (SPSS) For a stepwise regression 
study, statistics has generated quite a few tables of output. In this part, the researcher 
simply considers the three primary tables needed to evaluate the stepwise regression 
procedure’s results, provided as shown in Fig. 1 that no assumptions have been 
violated. When reviewing data for the two assumptions necessary to do stepwise 
regression analysis, a thorough explanation of the outcome must be understood. 
Relevant scatterplots, histograms (with overlay normal curves), Normal P-P Plots, 
case-by-case diagnostics, and the Durbin-Watson statistic are all included. Only the 
ﬁndings of the stepwise regression analysis are discussed here.

and is 0.790, indicating a high degree of correlation. The R square value which 
represents that number reﬂects how much the independent variable, Entertainment, 
Information, can explain in terms of the overall variance in the dependent variable, 
Consumer Attitude. 79% of the variance can be accounted in this situation, which is 
a signiﬁcant as shown in Table 2.

The regression analysis positively predicted the dependent variable, as shown 
in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This table extracted worth signiﬁes that the regres-
sion model’s got statistical signiﬁcance values. The signiﬁcant value p value is less 
than 0.05, indicating that the regression model statistically substantially predicts the 
outcome variable.

Stepwise regression, as shown in Table 9, is a mix of forward and backward selec-
tion procedures. It used to be highly popular, but the Multivariate Variable Selection 
process described later in this chapter will always perform at least as well, if not 
better. The Coefﬁcients table above provides us with the knowledge we need to antic-
ipate pricing based on income and determine if income has a statistically signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence on the models (Tables 7, 8 and 9).

Findings of the Study 
The study’s intention was to identify the how social media advertising affected 
people’s opinions about social networking ads, as well as the inﬂuence of word 
of mouth and purchase intent after seeing social media ads in Karachi. A total of 
500 Indian social media users’ questionnaires were found to be beneﬁcial. Stepwise 
regression analysis was used to examine the associations. We also noticed that has a 
positive impact on the value of social media advertising. 
The majority of responses were between the ages of 15 and 25, as this is the age 
group that spends the most time on social media. According to poll results, about 
half of all consumers purchase online once or twice per month. This might imply 
that they are from the working and middle classes, who do not have much spare time 
and who tend to buy in large quantities but less frequently from online platforms. 
According to the poll results, about half of the respondents spend 0–2 h every day 
on Social Media Networks.

Customers follows brands on social media because they want to hear about deals, 
new items, and so on. According to the survey results, about 61 percent of individuals 
use social media as an electronic word of mouth, and many consumers base their 
purchasing decisions on social media referrals. According to the study, over 47 
percent of respondents feel that the brand’s social media page/website inﬂuenced 
their perception of it. Most internet shoppers read evaluations about the brands of 
the items they are considering purchasing, which may inﬂuence their perception of 
that brand. According to the survey results, over 88 percent of respondents say social 
media plays an essential role in brand promotion since it increases visibility, allowing 
the company to create leads and improve sales.

Conclusion 
The conclusion of this study customers in the study area are vigorously by means 
of social television stages to verify their purchasing decisions. The mainstream of 
defendants contemplates that social media to be an arrangement of word-of-mouth 
will give more impact on consumer attitude. Previous customers’ recommendations 
and preferences stated on social media platforms impact new customers’ decision-
making. When compared to those who relied on other sources of information, tele-
vision users found decision-making to be simpler and more fun. Those who felt 
social media content was of better quality and quantity than expected were generally 
pleased. Inclusive, the data show that social media has a substantial impact on user 
behaviour. 
10 
Future Direction of the Study 
Contempt to the fact that the study remained conducted following strict protocols, 
it includes a number of ﬂaws. Social media marketing is not a new trend, and it 
continues to develop and evolve. There are a number of articles and books on the 
issue, but few of them link social media to changes in consumer behaviour. The 
results of the study are described in broad strokes. The study’s data sample was 
exceedingly small, implying that its generalizability was restricted. To safeguard 
more individuals in society and achieve more reliable results, the sample size should 
be increased. 
Due to differences in culture and values, consumer purchase behaviour may 
vary from country to country. The objectives have been narrowed to increase the 
study’s concentration, and the research only provides information on what has to be 
researched in light of the goals. 
Future research might use different scales and compare the ﬁndings to those found 
in this study. The application of this model in future experimental investigations is 
supposed to underwrite to the existing literature with respect to social networking 
sites impacts on users. In order to improve the subject of the study, it should be applied 
to a variety of client groups with different socio-demographic characteristics.

Introduction 
In Modern technologies IoT is mostly used technology to invent the new technolo-
gies for the use of society. Now we are going to do a project on the waste manage-
ment system by using IOT and Machine learning techniques. Because of its broad 
connection, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and intriguing technology that 
has the potential to positively impact human life [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) 
allows low-energy devices to communicate and interact with each other. Based on the 
background of IoT, many applications all over the world have implemented various 
processes. To prevent the wastage in the society this technology we are proposing. 
In the streets, near schools, colleges, outside the cities wherever we go we are seeing 
wastage anywhere [2]. 
Many people are working in the society for the collection of waste. People they 
are going to collect the waste from the houses, near drainages, and in the markets. 
They will take that waste into the vehicles and they will throw out of the villages. 
Some people those who are not working property in the municipality the head ofﬁcers 
doesn’t know about the people working properly or not [3]. To maintain the proper 
collection of waste and to ﬁnd the proper working of the workers this is very easy 
and useful to ﬁnd the collection of waste. And in this the data will be seen only by 
the head ofﬁcers in the corporation.

Most of the times the waste is everywhere in the society. And there are so many 
dump yards are available but people are not using properly, So to maintain the neat-
ness, clean in the society the municipality workers are working for the sake of clean 
society [4]. Now a days the workers also not working properly they are doing their 
own works at the time of ofﬁce hours. And they are collecting waste in some areas 
and dumping that waste into the dump yards and they are moving to their own works, 
So to identify the work of the workers and the collection of waste how much quan-
tity they are dumping daily to measure these this waste management system we are 
proposing [5]. Even though previously so many techniques are used to ﬁnd the quan-
tity of waste and working of the people based on the machine learning and GSM 
techniques. In those the data will not be secure. To secure the data of the collection 
of wastage this system we are proposing [6].

Literature Survey 
Many academics have researched and developed innovative applications for smart 
cities, particularly in the area of waste management based on the beneﬁts of IoT tech-
nologies. A simple system was demonstrated that detects the fullness of garbage cans. 
Which collected data and sent it using a wireless mesh network to save electricity and 
increase operational time. However, the system still has some confusing issues with 
the concept [7]. Software platform for smart cities was proposed to improve waste 
management; however, they primarily focused on Mobile Computing data collecting, 
and their platforms were made up of technologies from other ﬁrms. Some approaches, 
on the other side, optimization-based waste management solutions have been estab-
lished [8]. In order to achieve a more efﬁcient system. Using Lora WAN technology 
and route optimization, the authors suggested stage of trash management and control 
that might be used in some locations. In, a technique for collecting food waste was 
developed, in which data was collected using radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) 
technology and relayed via a mesh network of wireless devices. However, this tech-
nology has long-term limitations. Were signiﬁcant, especially given the smart city’s 
goal of large-area control. Finally, the optimization algorithm’s results grew too to 
be applied to a real-world system like a city, it’s a little fuzzy [9]. In, an outstanding 
architecture for a sensor node was suggested, which combined a microcontroller 
(ATMega328P) and a TTL—100 433 MHz module for practical waste management. 
Nonetheless, they simply used this platform is used to offer sensor nodes, and they 
did not use waste management techniques in the process. While the goal the purpose 
of this essay was to propose an Internet of Things application using the microcon-
troller board design was quite hard also, certain performance and functionality are 
required for each application. Our research uses machine learning and graph theory 
to improve waste collection systems, eliminate overﬂowing bins, and cut labour 
costs. In this study, we look at algorithms based on heuristic models or graph theory 
that can help us uncover strategies to reduce garbage collection distance [10]. The 
main goal is to minimise total transportation costs by transferring, saving labour, and

reducing reliance on obsolete cars, all while improving service quality and general 
quality of life. The other programme, which employs machine learning and graph 
theory techniques, prioritises garbage collection over cost and energy savings, and 
aids the university’s waste management network in performing at its best [11]. We 
compare and contrast the properties of the algorithms discussed in this part with 
our method. Our technology connects the Smart Dust Bins to the internet so that 
we can get real-time data on them [12, 13]. These bins are linked to an ultrasonic 
sensor-equipped Raspberry Pi system. The ultrasonic sensor measures the amount 
of dust in the dustbin and transmits signals to the Raspberry Pi, which encodes and 
delivers the signal to the application, which receives it [14]. The data was received, 
examined, and processed in a database that shows the state of garbage in the trashcan 
based on an authorized person’s request. The appropriate authority is notiﬁed that 
the dustbin is full, and the person in charge of collecting waste from the speciﬁc 
locations [15, 16]. 
3 
Existing Methodology 
The current approach can only measure the food waste of an entire organization or 
a speciﬁc bin for a single day, not for each and every individual person. With that 
information, the organization can only take a few steps to prevent food waste. The 
current approach is a semi-automated procedure in which the report must be person-
ally checked and the incentives must be manually selected. As previously stated, 
the current technology will only calculate the food waste of a whole organization. 
As a result, the organization’s data is only used in a limited number of ways. Even 
with the obtained data, there would be little inﬂuence in raising awareness or taking 
action among the organization’s employees. The current system is deﬁcient in the 
data collecting area, and the applications that can be created with the data collected 
are limited. As a result, the current system has limited utility. 
This method uses a mobile application to monitor garbage bins and provide infor-
mation on the amount of rubbish collected. The system detects the rubbish level and 
compares it to the depth of the garbage containers using ultrasonic sensors posi-
tioned over the bins. The Raspberry Pi is used to deliver data in this system. A 12 V 
power supply is used to power the system. The purpose of an application is to show 
the status to the person who is monitoring it. The programme shows a view of the 
garbage bins and color-codes the waste collected to display the amount of garbage 
collected. The data is saved in the database that is produced, and then it is retrieved. 
Communication is critical for service provisioning in IoT applied to external and 
public contexts. Because this sort of GSM has such a broad service domain, devices 
must be able to communicate with one another in a secure manner. As a result, the 
proposed system’s SGBs communicate with one another via a wireless mesh network, 
ensuring communication dependability. These equipment may need to move in the 
external environment on occasion. The suggested system’s mobility is ensured via a 
battery-based power supply.

Proposed Methodology 
The main aim of the proposed methodology is to collect the waste based on the 
quantity through the RFID cards provided to the each and every vehicle. And that 
will displays the time at what time they are dumping the waste into the dump yards. 
For the different type of vehicles they will keep workers by using with this system the 
workers also do their work properly within the given hours. For this we are proposing 
the new methodology called IoT and machine learning. By using the IoT the data will 
be secure and that data can be only read by the higher authorities in the corporations. 
We will use the machine learning code by using embedded c for the Arduino and then 
it is converted into the machine learning by using raspberry pi. And the proposed 
method will have the so many advantages it will reduces the cost. The data will be 
very secure. For this data secure we use the server called Think Speak in this the data 
will give for the different vehicles. 
By using these different cards for each vehicle will be entered into the server and 
the quantity that the vehicle is dumping the waste into the dump yards. In the below 
block diagram shows the circuit connections made on the board. Firstly we are using 
the two controllers those are raspberry pi3 and Arduino these are the major working 
mechanism for the circuit. ADC is used to convert the analog input to the digital 
input that is the convertor. We kept the load in the form of analog input but we need 
the results in the digital form so we need to use the ADC. The load cell is use to 
keep the load on the cell here we are proposing the weight limit of the circuit upto 
3kgs. To dump the program into the controller the power supply is used by using this 
power supply to the raspberry pi3 the inbuilt code will be generates in our system. 
Now we will keep the load on the load cell and here the RFID reader is used to scan 
the vehicle number. The government will allocate different numbers or ids for each 
vehicles. If one vehicles arrives that vehicle will load the waste and by using RFID 
reader it will scans the card and it will takes the weight and displays how much load 
they were added. Cloud /server is used to enter the whole information of each and 
every vehicle into the server and that was only seen by the head of the corporation. 
Think Speak server is connected through our cloud/server then our data is stored into 
the server it will displays id of the vehicle, weight, timings, date as shown in Fig. 1. 
If we add the weight of the same vehicle again by using RFID card it will add the 
data to the previous amount of the weight. If we didn’t gave any load means it will 
shows invalid.
The above Fig. 2 shows the block diagram for the power supply. Step down 
transformer is used to maintain the voltage powers we need the lower voltages for 
the kit it will converts the higher voltage powers to the lower voltage powers. Our 
system requires low voltages. And as the inputs we are providing ac inputs to convert 
into dc the bridge rectiﬁer is used. Regulator is provided to keep the constant voltages. 
Then ﬁnally that will provides the output towards the raspberry pi.

Experimental Results 
In our proposed model as shown in Fig. 3 the results shows that the managing of the 
waste based on the usage of different controllers like arduino and raspberry pi3. In 
the previous chapters we described about the components of the kit. After providing 
the connections to the raspberry pi and arduino the code is written based on the ids 
given to the RFID cards.
In the above trainer board all components are ﬁxed. By using the load cell the 
load is weighted on that max load of 3kgs we used. For the different load we used 
different RFID cards for the particular vehicle or dustbin. The cards will be read 
by using RFID module. The interconnection between arduino and Raspberry pi by 
using TTL (Transistor transistor logic). 
In the above Fig. 3 we kept the load as mobile phone on the load cell. By using 
RFID module, the card will be scanned. We placed input as analog form that will 
convert into digital by using ADC convertor. Now the weight will be displayed in 
the form of digital in grams. The above shown Fig. 4 shows the waste management 
system using IoT and machine learning. Shows the data that is acquired by the server

Conclusion 
As per the proposed system ﬁrstly we will design the circuit as per the block diagram. 
The load cell is used to weigh the load ﬁrstly we will weigh the waste on the load 
cell and then by using RFID module the card will be scanned the data will be entered 
into the server by using IoT. In the think speak that will displays the vehicle ID and 
the quantity of waste that vehicle will be going to dump and time. The data will be

very secure that can be read only by the higher authorities. If the weight is added 
by the same vehicle by using the RFID reader that will displays by adding previous 
weight to the present weight. By using this proposed method the labours can be easily 
identiﬁed by the head of the corporations whether they are working or not make their 
work easily by looking everything in the server.

Introduction 
In December 2019, an unidentiﬁed animal in Wuhan, China, transmitted the novel 
coronavirus (COVID-19), which had its origins in bats [1]. COVID-19 was deemed a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization 
on January 30, 2020, and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Chest X-ray imaging 
is helpful for a precise diagnosis because the virus initially affects the patient’s 
lungs [2]. Rapid detection and lowering exposure to the virus among medical or 
healthcare professionals would both beneﬁt from any automatic, dependable, and 
accurate screening method for COVID-19 infection [3]. Chest X-rays (CXR) and 
CT scan images are two examples of radiographic images that have seen extensive 
use of the deep learning paradigm [4]. These radiographic images contain a wealth of 
data, including patterns and cluster-like structures that are visible in the conformance 
and detection of pandemics similar to COVID-19 [5]. 
The most effective machine learning method is deep learning, which offers 
insightful analysis for examining a signiﬁcant number of chest x-ray images that 
have a signiﬁcant bearing on Covid-19 screening [6]. The chest X-ray images can 
be used to classify Covid positive and Covid negative patients using deep learning 
models. It’s crucial to make a quick diagnosis of COVID-19 and identify high-risk 
patients with poorer prognoses for early prevention and resource optimization in 
the medical ﬁeld. In order to quickly screen for COVID-19 and identify potential 
high-risk patients, deep learning offers a practical tool that may be useful for the

one as shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. 
COVID-19 has been detected, diagnosed, classiﬁed, predicted, and prognosed 
using several DL approaches, according to studies. Domiciliary datasets (counting 
CT and X-ray scans) as choice popular datasets were utilized in several experiments 
to train and validate the approaches. Reactivity, precision, and exactness are three 
criteria for evaluating efﬁcacy of methodologies employed in community research. 
Nonetheless, AUC has been utilized in a lot of studies to estimate the efﬁcacy about 
COVID-19 diagnosis approach [10].

The authors of [11], proposed a concept of Deep Learning based detection and anal-
ysis ofCOVID-19 ON Chest X-ray images. The details from the Kaggle repository 
were cleaned to meet the requirements. In order to get trustworthy results from a 
technique based on deep learning, you’ll need a lot of data. However, it’s probable 
that every problem, particularly in medical-related ones, lacks sufﬁcient evidence. It 
can be time-consuming and costly to obtain medical data. 
Augmentation is a technique that may be used to overcome problems like these. 
Overﬁtting can be eliminated by augmentation, and precision can be improved as 
shown in Figs. 5, and 6.

Xception Net 
Typical X-rays of the chest were compared to COVID-19 afﬂicted persons as part of 
the results analysis. The accuracy matrices are used to examine Inception Net V3, 
Xception Net, and resNeXt. After that, the results were compared to see which model 
was the best. Despite the model’s excellent accuracies, we recommend conﬁrming 
the results with future dataset updates. Due to a shortage of details, the replica is 
only instructed on 1560 illustratives. 
It is an offshoot of the Inception network. Here, depth-wise separable convolu-
tions replace inception modules. It has a framework proportion that is equivalent to 
inception net, although it outperforms it somewhat.

The authors of [3], proposed a concept of Deep Learning for COVID-19 Detection 
based on CT images [12]. The pseudo code for calibrating the Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) and acquiring the exactness might found within the result as shown 
in Fig. 7. 
They calculated the slope, and the parameters of network were changed for each 
iteration by picking b CT pictures at random [13]. They conﬁned the training steps 
rather than the iteration epoch, as opposed to the old conventional training approach. 
The authors utilised stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to select hyper parameters, 
The learning rate was programmed to 0.003, the force was programmed to 0.9, and 
the proportions of batch was programmed to 64. 512 × 512 × 512 × 512 image was 
the concluding input to the recommended structure, following which RGB reordering 
was applied [14]. The approach displays pseudo code for the Convolutional Neural 
Network is being ﬁne-tuned (CNN) and achieving accuracy as shown in Fig. 8.

modern methods currently available [15]. In our lab, we employ the Random and Bit-

2. Radiation dosage is high. 
The authors of [17], proposed the work of Deep-Learning based detection of COVID-
19 using lung ultrasound Images. B-lines in LUS are frequently used to suggest the 
tissue of Fibrous, erythrogenic cells, or Thermal value of lung ﬂuids may be present. 
These traits can be found in Interstitial lung disorders, pneumonia, and pulmonary 
emphysema are all examples of ARDS, to mention a few. It’s worth noting that 
isolated B-lines could be harmless (less than three). Its presence, however, may be 
associated to a speciﬁc lung ailment, based on the number of them and the distance 
between them. In general, the less lung aeration, the closer the B-Lines are together, 
the better (or even merged B-lines). A pleural effusion is a ﬂuid collection in the 
pleural space with no air [18–20]. Ultrasound identiﬁes not only effusion, as well as 
offers particulars about the type and identiﬁes location where thoracentesis should be 
performed (i.e., draining the pleural area of ﬂuid or air). Pneumonia and pulmonary 
edoema are both linked to pleural effusion. Furthermore, lung points with exclusive 
A-Lines are signiﬁcant predictor of pneumothorax diagnosis. Lung consolidation is 
characterized by a thick tissue formation as well as the appearance of the white spots 
with aspiratory reinforcement. Because cancerous tissue or pleural effusion ﬁlls air 
spaces, this means that lung aeration is completely lost. Lung consolidations can be 
seen in a variety of conditions, including pneumonia, atelectasis, lung contusion, and 
ARDS.

CNN-based replica. The Inception V3-based model had higher BACC, AUC-ROC 
and ACC mean values of 89.3, 97.3 and 89.1% Correspondingly. The Inception 
3-based replica, on the other hand, offered the best mean metric values regarding 
accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The ResNet50-based model, on the other hand, had 
the lowest mean accuracy, recollect, and F1-score. 
Limitations 
1. To produce a ﬁne-tuned version of the examined procedures, a bigger dataset 
would be necessary. 
2. Deep and intrapulmonary lesions are difﬁcult to detect with ultrasound. 
The authors of [19], proposed the concept of FCOD: Fast COVID-19 Detector 
based on deep learning techniques. Compared to the fundamental designs, this tech-
nique uses fewer layers and ﬁlters. In addition, instead of convolutional layers, we 
used depth wise separable convolution layers. 
Three pieces make up the model. The model’s input layer was created using the 
chest X-ray pictures in the ﬁrst stage. The max-pooling layer come after each of the 
depth wise divisible convolution layers after passing through four depth wise layers 
of divisible convolution. The Centre section was combined using 12 depth-separable 
convolution layers in the middle. Batch normalization follows the ﬁrst and second 
portions of the process. 
Furthermore, batch normalizing allows for considerable gradients, as well as 
the outcomes are seen in the initial convergence. Following 16 layers of separable 
convolution and a drop out ratio of 0.2, the drop out layers are applied.

Images based on Deep Learning is the third way. In this paper [20], he uses CT pictures 
to transfer learning COVID-19 testing, indicating that our replica, image Net21k 
was used to train it, is very generalizable when it comes to CT images. COVID-
19 detection utilizing lung ultrasound images is the fourth way. The employment 
of automated image diagnostic tools in this manner might signiﬁcantly reduce the

Introduction 
Gordon Moore, who helped start Intel, found out in the 1960s that the number of 
transistors on silicon ICs had grown every year since they were ﬁrst made. Moore’s 
law shows that this trend is likely to keep going strong in the near future [1]. Even 
though growth has slowed, the number of devices per square unit has gone up about 
every 18 months since then. Moore’s law describes a type of growth called exponen-
tial growth, which is likely to keep going on forever. Due to short channel effects in 
transistors, some studies say that the physical limit of integration could be reached 
as early as 2017. Integrated circuits have changed a lot over the past 50 years, with 
the number of devices on a single silicon chip growing from a few thousand to more 
than a million. The IC industry for electronic devices like cell phones has made a lot 
of progress, especially in the last ten years [2]. This means that in the next few years, 
chips with a higher number of transistors that can run at different Giga Hertz rates will 
be possible to make. Such chips could start a new trend in electronic devices, making 
it possible for cool things like augmented reality, wearable computers, and computers 
that can be put into the body. It could make low-cost point-to-point communication 
around the world possible for everyone [3, 4]. As VLSI technology improved quickly, 
it became possible to automate some of the steps needed to design, test, and make

VLSI-speciﬁc circuits. In today’s technological society, integrated circuits are made 
up of many different large electronic parts. These parts are put together by putting 
them in a certain order on a single piece of silicon, called a “wafer,” as shown in Fig. 1. 
Layout is the process by which an IC designer changes a description of a circuit into 
a description of its shape. There are several layers of ﬂat geometric shapes that make 
up a layout. The layout is checked to make sure it meets all the design standards that 
are wanted. The next step is to make a set of design ﬁles that describe the layout 
of the design. Pattern generator ﬁles can be made by the optical pattern generator 
(design ﬁles) [5]. The ﬁles that are made are then used to make “Masks,” which are 
patterns for laying out circuits. During the manufacturing process, these masks are 
used to line up the silicon case using the different stages of Photo-Lithography [6, 7]. 
For the device to be made, the minimum size of the geometric patterns’ features and 
the minimum distance between them must be known with accuracy.

Literature Review 
The authors of [8] came up with a new method that changes integer coding based on 
the number of modules. In this paper, mutation and crossover operators from genetic 
algorithms are used with discrete particle swarm optimization to come up with better 
solutions. The authors compare and contrast Simulated Annealing with B*Tree, 
Particle Swarm, and DPSO algorithms. In the trials, the MCNC and GSRC bench-
mark circuits were used, and the proposed method did well in terms of placement 
because it avoided local minimums. 
The researchers in [9], K. Premalatha and A.M. Natarajan made GA a hybrid and 
looked into how it could be used with other optimization techniques. This article 
talked about hybrid methods that use both Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and 
Genetic Algorithms (GA). Both PSO and GA are heuristic and population-based 
search strategies that have been used to solve optimization problems that are getting 
harder and harder to solve. In order to get rid of the early stagnation seen in traditional 
PSO, this article gives you the change tactics for PSO that use GA. The authors of 
[10] showed comparison results for non-slicing hard module VLSI ﬂoor layout using 
B*Tree representation with a hybrid genetic algorithm and memetic algorithm. The 
results come from MCNC benchmark circuits that have HGA. The results show that 
a hybrid genetic algorithm could be used to cut down on the size of the circuit. 
Then, in 2012 [11], the authors came up with a work called “Optimization of 
Floor-planning Using Genetic Algorithm”. The work shown here is a creative way 
to solve problems with VLSI ﬂoor planning. This method is based on the POEMS 
algorithm for optimising repeating prototypes with improving changes [12–14]. In 
each cycle, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for local search because both methods 
have been useful in the past for solving problems that are similar. GA was used to do 
well-known MCNC benchmark tasks and was evaluated on those tasks. Experiments 
show that the Genetic Algorithm quickly comes up with the best answers to all 
benchmark problems studied. The authors looked at a lot of algorithms in 2013.

They found that while not all of them were good, a few were very good and have 
become popular tools for solving real-world and high-deﬁnition problems [15]. Some 
algorithms are not studied enough because of how they work [16–19]. The goal of 
this review is to make a complete list of all optimization algorithms that have been 
written about so that they can inspire more research [20]. 
In 2014, the researchers in [21] proposed a way to improve VLSI physical design 
automation. The authors used a Hybrid Genetic algorithm to ﬁnd the answer. The 
people who wrote this article did all the physical design calculations on their own. 
A Genetic Algorithm is used to improve things on a global scale [22]. Simulated 
annealing is used to improve things locally. Then, in 2015, Debao Chen, Jing Chen, 
and others came up with a new way to improve the global performance of particle 
swarm optimization (PSO) by extending the domain exploration of the optimal solu-
tion in the current generation and the optimal solution reached by each particle 
[23–25]. The algorithm is easy to use because it doesn’t change the core of PSO, and 
it can be easily added to other optimization methods to speed things up.

Simulation Results of MCNC Benchmark Circuits 
for PSO Algorithm 
For the MCNC APTE Benchmark circuit, which has 9 computational blocks, 97 nets, 
and a standard area of 46.5616 mm2, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is 
used. Figure 2 shows how the simulation turned out. So that the best places to put 
the blocks can be found, they are moved around so that they don’t overlap. The 
PSO algorithm has better criteria for exploratory search that lead to the best optimal 
result. The plot shows how the blocks are set up based on the internal properties of 
the APTE circuit being looked at, which is a part of the MCNC benchmark. Here, 
the best placement position is found by looking at where the object is now and how 
much space it needs. The Particle Swarm Optimization method uses 1000 iterations. 
At each iteration, the position of the Computation Logic Block is changed though 
the presentbestcost is better compared to the preceding best cost. If not, the position 
stays the same. 
The MCNC XEROX Benchmark circuit, which has 10 computational blocks, 203 
nets, and a standard area of 19.3503 mm2, uses the Particle Swarm Optimization 
algorithm. Figure 3 shows what happened in the simulation. To get a better arrange-
ment without losing any information, the overlap needs to be stopped. So that there 
are no overlaps, the blocks are shufﬂed to ﬁnd the best places to put them. The best 
places to put things are arranged by stack. Here, the best place to put something is 
decided by comparing where it is now to where there is the least amount of space. 
The Particle Swarm Optimization method needs 1000 iterations, and at each itera-
tion, the placement of the Computation Logic Block is changed if the existing best 
cost is lower compared with the earlier best cost. If not, position stays the same.

The Particle Swarm Optimization method is used for the MCNC Benchmark HP 
circuit, which has 11 computational blocks, 83 nets, and a standard size of 8.8306 
mm2. Figure 4 shows how the simulation turned out. So that there are no overlaps, 
the blocks are moved around to ﬁnd the best way to put them together. The gaps 
between the blocks can be bigger than they need to be, which shows how limited the 
process is in this case. Here, the best place to put something is found by comparing 
where it is now to where there is the least amount of space.

Fig. 5 Simulation result with PSO for MCNC AMI33 circuit 
The Particle Swarm Optimization method needs 1000 iterations, and at each 
iteration, the Computation Logic Block’s placement location is changed then the 
contemporary best cost is fewer than earlier best cost. Otherwise, position stays the 
same. 
The MCNC AMI33 Benchmark circuit, which has 33 computational blocks, 123 
nets, and a standard area of 1.1564 mm2, uses the Particle Swarm Optimization 
algorithm. Figure 5 shows how the simulation turned out. In order to discover the 
best placement sites, the blocks are shufﬂed so that there is no overlap. To get a better 
arrangement without losing any information, the overlap needs to be stopped. After 
looking at where things already are and how little space there is, the best place to put 
something is chosen. 
It can be seen that the spaces between the blocks are bigger than they need to be. 
This shows how limited the process is. The Particle Swarm Optimization method 
needs 1000 iterations. Best cost now is a lesser amount compare with best cost 
before, the placement location of the Computation Logic Block is changed. If not, 
the position stays the same. The MCNC AMI 49 Benchmark circuit uses the Particle 
Swarm Optimization method. This circuit has 49 computational blocks, 408 nets, 
and a standard size of 35.4454 mm2. Figure 6 shows how the simulation turned out. 
In order to ﬁnd the best places to put the blocks, they are moved around so that they 
don’t touch each other.
After looking at where things already are and how little space there is, the best 
place to put something is chosen. The Particle Swarm Optimization method needs 
1000 iterations. The best cost now is less than the best cost before, the placement 
location of the Computation Logic Block is changed. If not, the position stays the 
same.

Simulation Results of MCNC Benchmark Circuits 
for Genetic Algorithm 
For the MCNC APTE Benchmark circuit, which contains 9 computational blocks, 
97 nets, and a standard size of 46.5616 mm2, the Genetic algorithm is used. Figure 7 
shows what happened in the simulation. To ﬁnd the best places to put the blocks, they 
are moved around so that they don’t touch each other. After looking at the current 
position and how little space can be used, the best place to put something is found. 
Because of how GA works, putting blocks next to each other with space between 
them leads to bad results.
The Genetic Algorithm method needs 1000 iterations. If the best cost now is less 
than the best cost before, the placement of the Computation Logic Block is changed. 
If the best cost now is the same as the best cost before, the position stays the same. 
The MCNC XEROX Benchmark circuit, which has ten computational blocks, 203 
nets, and a standard area of 19.3503 mm2, is optimised using the Genetic algorithm. 
Figure 8 shows what the simulation came up with.
To determine the optimal placement of the blocks, they are shufﬂed in such a 
way that no blocks overlap. Here, the optimal placement position is determined by 
comparing the present position to the smallest available space. The spaces between 
the blocks can be found to be wider than they need to be, indicating the process’s 
limitations. These gaps must be reduced in size in order to optimize the area and 
wirelength. 
The Genetic Algorithm process is repeated 1000 times, and during each iteration, 
if the current best cost is less than the prior best cost, the placement position of the 
Computation Logic Block is altered; otherwise, the position remains unchanged.

The MCNC Benchmark HP circuit is made with the Genetic algorithm. It has 11 
computational blocks, 83 nets, and a standard area of 8.8306 mm2. Figure 9 shows 
what the simulation came up with. So that there are no overlaps, the blocks are 
shufﬂed to ﬁnd the best places to put them. Here, the best place to put something is 
decided by comparing where it is now to where there is the least amount of space.

To avoid overlaps, the best care must be taken to ﬁnd the available space. The 
Genetic Algorithm method needs 1000 iterations, and at each iteration, the placement 
of the Computation Logic Block is changed then recent best cost is lesser than the 
prior best cost. If not, the position stays the same. 
The GA-Genetic Algorithm is used for MCNC AMI33 Benchmark Circuit, which 
has 33 computational blocks, 123 nets, and a standard area of 1.1564 mm2. Figure 10 
shows what happened in the simulation. To ﬁnd the best places to put the blocks, they 
are moved around so that they don’t touch each other. After looking at the current 
position and how little space can be used, the best place to put something is found. 
It’s possible that the spaces between the blocks are bigger than they need to be, which 
shows how limited the process is. As the GA is hard to compute, putting the blocks 
in order can take a long time, which is a clear limitation. To get the best area and wire 
length, these gaps need to be made smaller. The Genetic Algorithm Optimization 
method needs 1000 iterations. If the best cost now is less than the best cost before, 
the placement of the Computation Logic Block is changed. If the best cost now is 
the same as the best cost before, the position stays the same.
The MCNC AMI 49 Benchmark circuit, which has 49 computational blocks, 408 
nets, and a standard area of 35.4454 mm2, is optimised with a genetic algorithm. 
Figure 11 shows what the simulation came up with. To ﬁgure out where the blocks 
should go best, they are mixed up so that none of them overlap. Here, the best place to 
put something is found by comparing where it is now to the smallest space available. 
But because the structure of Genetic Algorithms is more complicated, they don’t 
scale as well. The Genetic Algorithm process is repeated 1000 times. During each 
iteration, the placement position of the Computation Logic Block is changed if the 
current best cost is less than the previous best cost. Otherwise, the position stays the 
same. Since GA is based on chance, not all iterations lead to good results.

The Harmony Search algorithm is used for the MCNC APTE Benchmark circuit, 
which consists of 9 computational blocks, 97 nets, and a standard area of 46.5616 
mm2. 
The simulation result is shown in Fig. 12. To ﬁnd the optimal placements for laying 
the blocks, they are shufﬂed so that there is no overlap. Here, the ideal placement

location is determined by comparing the present position to the smallest amount of 
space available. The Harmony Search Optimization method requires 1000 iterations, 
and for each iteration, if the current best cost is lower than the previous best cost, 
the placement location of the Computation Logic Block is altered; otherwise, the 
position remains unchanged. 
The Particle Harmony Search algorithm is used in the MCNC XEROX Benchmark 
circuit. It is made up of 10 computational blocks, 203 nets, and a standard area of 
19.3503 mm2. The result of the simulation is shown in Fig. 13. When the blocks 
are moved around to ﬁnd the best place to put them, they don’t touch each other. In 
general, the HS algorithm imitates the musician’s height by giving the best nodes 
for music, which leads to the best arrangement of blocks. Here, the best place to put 
something is decided by comparing where it is now to the smallest amount of space 
possible.
It’s possible that the spaces between the blocks are too big, which shows how 
limited the process is. These spaces need to be smaller so that the most space and 
wire length can be used. In the Harmony Search Optimization method, there are 1000 
iterations, and the placement of the Computation Logic Block is changed if the best 
cost now is better than the best cost before. Other than that, it stays the same. 
The Harmony Search algorithm is used in the MCNC Benchmark HP circuit, 
which contains 11 computational blocks, 83 nets, and a standard area of 
8.8306 mm2. 
Figure 14 shows what the simulation came up with. So that there are no overlaps, 
the blocks are shufﬂed to ﬁnd the best places to put them. Here, the best place to 
put something is decided by comparing where it is now to where there is the least 
amount of space. The HS algorithm tends to always give a perfect state of harmony,

but it is easy for it to get stuck in local optima, which slows convergence and makes 
the arrangement messier. The Harmony Search Optimization method needs 1000 
iterations, and at each iteration, the placement of the Computation Logic Block is 
changed if the current best cost is lower than the previous best cost. If not, the position 
stays the same.

The Harmony Search method is used on the MCNC AMI33 Benchmark circuit, 
which has 33 computational blocks, 123 nets, and a standard area of 1.1564 mm2. 
Figure 15 shows what happened in the simulation. To ﬁnd the best places to put the 
blocks, they are moved around so that they don’t touch each other. After looking at 
the current position and how little space can be used, the best place to put something 
is found. It’s possible that the spaces between the blocks are bigger than they should 
be, showing that there are problems with the process. The HS method usually leads 
to a perfect state of harmony, but it can get stuck in local optima, which slows 
convergence and makes the arrangement look messier. 
To make the best use of the space and wire length, these gaps need to be made 
smaller. The Harmony Search Optimization method needs 1000 iterations. If the 
current best cost is less than the previous best cost, the position of the Computation 
Logic Block is changed. If the current best cost is the same as the previous best cost, 
the position of the Computation Logic Block stays the same. 
For the MCNC AMI49 Benchmark circuit, which has 49 computational blocks, 
408 nets, and a standard area of 35.4454 mm2, the Harmony Search algorithm is used. 
Figure 16 shows what the simulation came up with. So that there are no overlaps, 
the blocks are shufﬂed to ﬁnd the best places to put them. Here, the best place to 
put something is decided by comparing where it is now to where there is the least

need to be, showing weaknesses.

Statistical Comparison 
Table 2 shows how the evolutionary algorithms were used to arrange the blocks so 
that they met the requirements for the MCNC benchmark circuit in terms of area, wire 
length, and dead space. This table compares the area that was found to the standard 
values in Tables 1, 3, and 4. It can be seen that the values for Area, Wirelength, and 
Dead space are closer to what would be expected. In this case, the number of blocks 
and standard MCNC Benchmarks are used to ﬁgure out the area, wirelength, and 
dead space. 
“Area, Wirelength, and Dead space” is a type of objective function that sums up the 
whole performance into a single important parameter so that the best design solutions 
can be found. For each Benchmark circuit, the numbers for Area, Wirelength, and 
Deads pace show how well the solution ﬁts the given number of cells and nets. It’s 
important to note that XEROX BMC has the largest Area, Wirelength, and Dead 
space in GA. This means that the solution comes closest to meeting the overall needs

of the intended solution. The GA Algorithm was used to place blocks on MCNC 
benchmark circuits. Table 2 shows the area and wirelength values that were found. 
The Harmony Search Algorithm for Block Placement was also used to analyze 
the MCNC Benchmark circuits; the area and wire length, as well as the area, wire 
length, and dead space, are listed in Table 3. 
As can be seen, the resultant area is optimal in comparison to the standard values 
for the respective benchmark circuits. Here, the values for Area, Wirelength, and 
Dead space are better for APTE and HP, indicating the ﬁt element of the optimal 
solution in solving the Block Placement Problem of the task. 
When dealing with Area, Wirelength, and Dead space values, it is necessary to 
keep in mind that there is no hard and fast rule dictating that a certain value of the 
concerned parameters, such as Area and wirelength, must be used. Furthermore, the 
PSO Algorithm was explored for block placement on MCNC benchmark circuits, and

the acquired area and related wirelength values are shown in Table 4. When compared 
to standard values, the produced area has optimal values. Area, Wirelength, and Dead 
space all prove to be optimal values for the HP benchmark circuit at 1.025, with an 
area increase of 18%.PSO arranges the particles randomly by promoting the values 
acquired for Area, Wirelength, and Dead space in relation to the best value for the 
individual particle and the best value for the swarm’s position, respectively, in order 
to achieve an ideal solution.

Conclusion 
As the simulation results have been initiated for Placement and Routing with six 
Optimization Algorithms, as three algorithms namely Genetic Algorithm, Particle 
Swarm Optimization and Harmony Search Algorithm have provided best cost solu-
tion along with less computation time. These three algorithms have been investigated 
on the standard MCNC Benchmark circuits have been compared in terms of Obtained 
Area, Wirelength and Dead space. 
As per theoretical and standard norms the obtained area must be less and nearer 
to standard area values as provided in Table 1. It is obvious that Particle Swarm 
Optimization and Harmony Search algorithms have yielded the minimum area when 
compared to Genetic Algorithm. Similarly the signiﬁcant parameters Wirelength and 
Dead space were also computed through the three Optimization algorithms and it 
is observed that Particle Swarm Optimization and Harmony Search algorithms have 
provided the best and Optimum values.

Introduction 
Image denoising is the removal of noise or distortions from an image [1]. There 
are numerous applications where blurred images can be made clear. As a result of 
medical imaging research, numerous diagnostic methods, including CT, MRI, and 
ultrasound, have been developed [2]. Each has a unique set of beneﬁts and drawbacks 
[3]. The procedure of creating visual representations of the interior of the body for 
medical diagnosis is known as medical imaging [4]. It aids in the discovery of internal 
structures hidden beneath the skin and bones, as well as in the treatment and diagnosis 
of diseases [5]. It detects abnormalities using a database of physiology and normal 
anatomy [6]. Organs and tissues that can be imaged for medical purposes are removed 
[7]. This is a pathology procedure, not a medical imaging procedure [8]. Medical 
imaging is a subset of biological imaging, and image noise suppression is a major 
issue, particularly when images are obtained under adverse conditions [9].

Need and Signiﬁcance of the Proposed Work 
Medical imaging and diagnostics techniques have grown in popularity over the last 
two decades as a result of rapid advancements in computing, internet, data storage, 
and Wireless technology [10]. The impact of these advancements can be seen in the 
ﬁeld of medicine and medical sciences, which allows for more effective diagnosis 
and treatment of various diseases [11].
• Further more, medical imaging is frequently justiﬁed in the surveillance of a 
disease that has already been diagnosed and treated [12].
• The outcomes proved that suggested technique emerge signiﬁcantly better in 
values of different quantitative measures such as signal to noise ratio, high snr 
will be required [13].
• It improves Image quality. The Proposed denoising method outperforms the 
existing method in experimental results [14].
• It improves medical image processing performance [15].

Proposed Methodology
• The unique ﬁlter fabrication would be preferred almost universally because the 
complexity of the ﬁlter does not affect its realization in a digital system as shown 
in Fig. 1.
• Both ﬁlters were identical in size (order) and took about the same amount of time 
to process a photo.
• In this technique we are using Woelfel method (using two ﬁr ﬁlters).
• Whether decimating or interpolating, the use of FIR ﬁlters allows for the omission 
of some calculations, resulting in signiﬁcant computational efﬁciency.
• In contrast, if IIR ﬁlters are used, each output must be computed independently, 
regardless of whether it will be rejected (thus adding feedback into the ﬁlter).
• They work well in applications requiring several rates. We suggest that "interpo-
lation" refers to either increasing the sampling rate or both, whereas "decimation" 
refers to decreasing the sampling rate.
• FIR ﬁlters are employed for decimating as well as interpolating, and they 
allow the elimination of certain calculations, considerably enhancing computer 
performance.
• In contrast, even if a result is eliminated (to incorporate feedback), each output 
of IIR ﬁlters must be computed independently.

step1: Upload an image. 
In this Case, we took the input as a brain scan image from a database of brain scans. 
step2: To calculate the mean luminance (light intensity), we take an RGB image as 
input and convert it to grayscale, saving the result as another variable. 
step3: Mesh grid image Using the meshgrid PSD, we can calculate the visualisation 
of the base picture. 
step4: A PSD image with a grayscale estimated PSD imagining of corrupt image. 
step5: Random noise is going to be applied to the image’s PSD.

step6: Noisy image as a result, we will obtain the noisy image. 
step7: We can obtain the mesh grid PSD estimate the imagining of noisy image. 
step8: We acquire the PSD that contains the noisy image once more. 
step9: The noisy picture output PSD is supplied. 
step10: Image produced with the Woelfel ﬁlter. 
When compared with the current technique, it provides the PSD of the completed 
image and a higher snr, which improves image quality. 
Step11: The woelfel ﬁlter output picture is the greatest quality image that the detector 
receives. The detector is an image processing technique for determining the bound-
aries of the objects within images. It detects brightness discontinuities. The detector 
output is fed into the morphological operation. 
Step12: The morphological operation, morphology is a broad set of image processing 
operations that process images based on shapes. The value of each pixel in the output 
image is determined by a comparison of the corresponding pixel in the input image 
with its neighbours in a morphological operation. 
Step13: The morphological process’s output picture is dilatable. Dilation adds pixels 
to the boundaries of objects in an image, whereas erosion removes pixels from object 
boundaries. the number of pixels added or removed from the size and shape of the 
structuring element used to process the image determines the size and shape of the 
objects in the image. 
Step14: The tumour is detected in the brain after the dilation process is completed. 
Results 
The brain BMP scan image was loaded into Matlab and recorded in Fig. 2 for the 
ﬁrst part of the project. The PSD approximation for the absence of noise BMP scan 
was generated and illustrated using two ways since the PSD evaluation of a picture 
has to be performed in two dimensions depending on pixel value as well as position.
First, in Fig. 3, the meshgrid displayed representation of the PSD estimate was 
recorded in 3D.
Figure 4 shows the greyscale 2D representation of the PSD estimate. These images 
were created with the code labelled “Standard PSD.”
The second stage of the project involved introducing random noise into the BMP 
image. This was accomplished by adding noise to each pixel in the MATLAB code 
with a magnitude ranging from 0 to 20% of the maximum 255 amplitude (UINT8 
standard). Figure 5 shows the “noisy” image, and the SNR was calculated by aver-
aging the ratio between the base image and the noise signal at each pixel. The noisy 
psd and noisy meshgrid images are created after the noisy image. The lowpass ﬁltered 
image’s PSD had ringing in the darker regions, resulting in blurriness in the overall 
image as shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 8.
Figure 8 depicts the image output from the one-of-a-kind ﬁlter design.

Figure 9 shows the PSD estimate visualisations in meshgrid form.
While Fig. 10 shows them in grayscale form. The PSD of the uniquely ﬁltered 
image had no ringing but allowed a small amount of information to pass through 
in a uniform shape from the PSD’s edges. This PSD was much more similar to the 
original image than the lowpass ﬁltered PSD as shown in Fig. 11. In every  way,  the  
one-of-a-kind ﬁlter outperformed the ideal lowpass ﬁlter. The SNR was improved, 
and more information from the original BMP scan was recovered.
A tumour is detected after some process is applied to the ﬁlter output.

Future Scope 
Image denoising is the removal of noise or distorations from an image. There are 
numerous applications where blurred images can be made clear. In the future, the 
snr of the woelfel ﬁlters will be higher than that of other ﬁlters, resulting in a clearer 
image than with other ﬁlters. When compared to other ﬁlters, the tumour detects very 
clearly.

Conclusion 
The key problem that this study experienced was that SNR and blurriness appeared 
to be proportionate. When a result, as the image’s blurriness increased, so did the 
SNR. Instead of having a sharp cut off like the ideal lowpass ﬁlter, the unique ﬁlter 
seemed to solve this problem by sloping down to a minimum amplitude. A higher 
order ﬁlter with amplitude roll-off characterised by a cosine wave with its peak at the 
centre of the ﬁlter could give even better results in the future. Any ﬁlter that produces 
an SNR in the 2530 dB range without substantially blurring the image and losing 
essential information appears implausible. MATLAB’s Image Processing Toolbox 
was also unavailable for this project, but it would have provided a range of options.

Introduction 
Researchers have paid close attention to viscoelastic ﬂuid models during the 
last 15 years due to its unique combination of viscosity and elasticity features. 
Viscoelastic ﬂuids, unlike differential type ﬂuids, can accurately forecast stress relax-
ation. When compared to Newtonian ﬂuids, these ﬂuids are particularly adept in 
reducing large-scale ﬂuxes. Previous research has looked into the ﬂow properties of 
Jeffery nanoﬂuids past a stirring shield in the conducting area (Hari Babu et al., [1]) 
and radiative ﬂow over an inclinator plate with concurrent heat and mass transfer 
(Bhuvaneswari et al., [2]). Hari Babu et al. [3] investigated the Hall and ion-slip effects 
of Jeffery ﬂuids rotating over an inﬁnite vertical porous region in the presence of 
MHD free convection. Krishna et al. [4] investigated heat and mass transport in MHD 
non-conducting ﬂows through a vertical permeable plate. The similar ﬂow through 
porous surfaces with chemical reactions was examined by Nayak et al. [5]. Chandra 
Reddy et al. [6, 7] highlighted the detailed effects of heat and solute buoyancy on 
ﬂow under varied suction and parameter modiﬁcations. Chowdary and Kumar Das [8] 
investigated how heat and mass transport, thermo-radiation, and chemical reactions 
affected this ﬂow. Srinivasa et al. [9] used the ﬁnite element method to investigate

the existence of dissipative ﬂows of Casson ﬂuid and integrated cross diffusion char-
acteristics. In their analysis, Rajput et al. [10] took into account mass diffusion and 
changeable temperature. Chandra Reddy et al. [11] investigated the parabolic ﬂow of 
MHD ﬂuid past a vertical plate in a porous media using a computer model. Nagaraju 
et al. [12] investigated the ﬂow of MHD viscoelastic ﬂuid across an inﬁnite vertical 
plate in the presence of radiation and chemical reaction. Several recent studies [2, 3, 
13–22] were also mentioned and studied for this analysis. 
However, earlier investigations in the literature have generally focused on the ﬂow 
of viscoelastic ﬂuids past vertical porous plates and have primarily studied Newto-
nian ﬂuids. Nagaraju et al. [12] recognised the limits of previous investigations and 
focused their research on the ﬂow of non-Newtonian ﬂuids past slanted plates. The 
current work is an extension of prior research, with the angle of inclination as the 
primary parameter. It is predicted that by applying Machine Learning techniques 
into this research, the ﬁndings will be greatly enhanced. Machine Learning tech-
niques can improve the accuracy and predictive capacities of models used to analyse 
non-Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂow behaviour. Machine Learning integration can enable the 
identiﬁcation of complex patterns and correlations within data, resulting in more 
robust and accurate predictions. As a result, incorporating Machine Learning into 
this study has the potential to improve knowledge and characterisation of viscoelastic 
ﬂuid ﬂow past inclined plates, ultimately contributing to advances in ﬂuid dynamics. 
This study comprehensively investigates the affects of the Dufour effect, radiation 
absorption, and heat generation on inclined plates, with the purpose of using Machine 
Learning approaches to improve overall research ﬁndings.

Formulation of the Model Problem 
In unsteady situations, the liquid ﬂow under visco-elasticity via liable vertical leaky 
plate is selected. It also involves the presence of a heat source; chemical reaction 
and thermal diffusion effect [3, 16, 17]. The axis of x* is taken as the ﬂow path 
along the vertical plate and is normal to the axis of y*. In the direction of y* axis, a 
magnetic ﬁeld of equal ability is applied in transverse mode [18]. The ﬂow medium 
and plate are ﬁrst maintained at temperature up p
er T Subscript normal infinity Superscript asteriskand at all points of the ﬂuid at the 
same concentration up
per C Subscript normal infinity Superscript asterisklevels. An impulsive motion with velocity u equals u 0 is given 
to the plate when time elapses and thus temperature and concentration up p
er  T S ub
script w Superscript asterisk Baseline and upper C Subscript w Superscript asterisk
are respectively preserved [19].

Rather than presuming ﬁxed boundary conditions, Machine Learning can be used 
to capture the system’s dynamic behaviour and determine the appropriate boundary 
conditions. Based on the current state of the system, machine learning models can 
learn from historical data or simulations to predict the boundary conditions. Analyt-
ical solutions are provided by ordinary differential equations that satisfy the boundary 
conditions.

Results and Findings 
On the basis of the precise solutions, numeric data and graphical representations are 
derived. Utilising MATLAB software [2, 20] and incorporating Machine Learning 
techniques, the computations and corresponding outcomes were obtained. Under 
the inﬂuence of thermal diffusion, radiation absorption, and heat generation, a 
closed analytical solution is obtained for the problem of erratic MHD convective 
Non-Newtonian ﬂuid ﬂow, with the assistance of Machine Learning algorithms for 
improved accuracy and prediction. With the aid of data-driven models, the results 
are depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 and Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 to clarify 
physical observations.
Figures 1 through 5 depict the variations in ﬂuid velocity under the inﬂuence of 
different parameters, as predicted by Machine Learning models. Figure 1 depicts the 
effect of the thermal Grash of number on velocity, where the Machine Learning model 
captures the relationship between the parameters and velocity changes. Due to buoy-
ancy acting on the ﬂuid particles as a result of gravitational force, as the Grashof 
number increases, so does the velocity. Figure 2 depicts similar effects, wherein 
customised Grashof numbers increase ﬂuid velocity. Figure 3 depicts velocity proﬁles 
with magnetic parameter variation, with the Machine Learning model taking into 
consideration the effect of magnetic parameters on velocity reduction. The magnetic 
ﬁeld’s Lorentz force opposes ﬂuid motion, resulting in a decrease in velocity. Figure 4 
depicts the variations in velocity proﬁles for various permeability parameter values, 
with the Machine Learning model accurately predicting velocity increases as perme-
ability parameter increases. Figure 5 depicts the variations in velocity caused by the

model captures the increase in velocity across the range of angles. The angular 
moving plate opposes the ﬂow, resulting in an increase in velocity.

Figures 6 through 9 illustrate, with the aid of machine learning, the tempera-
ture variations of a ﬂuid as a function of various parameters. Figure 6 demonstrates 
that an increase in the Prandtl number signiﬁcantly reduces the temperature of the 
viscous ﬂuid, with the Machine Learning model providing accurate predictions. As 
the Prandtl number increases, the thermal boundary layer decreases. Figure 7 depicts 
the effect of heat source on temperature, with the Machine Learning model accu-
rately depicting the increase in temperature as the heat source parameter increases. 
Figure 8 depicts the effect of radiation parameters on the temperature distribution,

with the Machine Learning model depicting the decrease in temperature as the radi-
ation parameter values increase. Figure 9 depicts the temperature effect of the radia-
tion absorption parameter, where the Machine Learning model predicts temperature 
changes as the parameter increases. Figure 10 depicts the effect of the chemical 
reaction on concentration, with the Machine Learning model accurately depicting 
the concentration decrease as the chemical reaction parameter increases. 
The study of variations in skin friction is continued based on the relevant numerical 
value considerations in Table 1, with the incorporation of Machine Learning tech-
niques for more precise predictions. As predicted by Machine Learning models, the 
velocity gradient increases as the magnetic parameter, inclination angle, and Prandtl 
number values rise, while the inﬂuence of the viscoelastic parameter results in an 
overturning character. As predicted by the Machine Learning models, increasing 
values of Prandtl number (Pr) and Reynolds number (Re) and decreasing values 
of friction factor (Df) contribute to an increase in the rate of heat transmission, as 
shown in Table 2. The concentration gradient at the base of the plate is also analysed 
and presented in Table 3, under the inﬂuence of Schmidt number (Sc) and Kr, with 
Machine Learning models accurately depicting the gradient increase. The present 
results are contrasted with the previously published results of Nagaraju et al. [12], 
demonstrating a high degree of congruence between the two and further validating 
the Machine Learning models’ predictions. In addition, the effect of thermal radi-
ation on temperature proﬁles in the absence of the angle of inclination, radiation 
absorption, and heat generation is considered, and a comparison reveals a strong 
agreement between the predicted and published results, further demonstrating the 
efﬁcacy of the integrated Machine Learning approach (Table 4).

Conclusions 
This study has provided useful insights into the fundamental components driving 
the phenomenon under investigation. The ﬁndings are summarized below. As the 
Grashof number, corrected Grashof number, permeability of the porous material, 
and angle of inclination increase, so does the velocity. The inclusion of a magnetic 
parameter, on the other hand, produces a drop in velocity, as predicted by the included 
Machine Learning models. The temperature and the heat source parameter have a 
clear association, showing that the temperature rises as the heat source becomes more 
apparent. In contrast, as anticipated by the Machine Learning models, the temperature 
drops as the Prandtl number, radiation parameter, and radiation absorption parameter 
increase. 
The concentration decreases as the Schmidt number and chemical reaction param-
eters increase. As the Schmidt number and chemical reaction parameters grow, the 
concentration drops, as demonstrated by the Machine Learning models. Overall, this 
research highlights the complex relationships between many parameters and their 
effects on velocity, temperature, and concentration proﬁles. By offering accurate 
predictions and deeper insights into the researched events, the adoption of Machine

Learning techniques has contributed to a better understanding of the underlying 
mechanisms. More research can be conducted to investigate new variables and 
develop Machine Learning models for better predictions in comparable ﬂuid ﬂow 
conditions.

Improved Stockwell Transform for Image 
Compression and Reconstruction 
Padigala Prasanth Babu, T. Jayachandra Prasad, and K. Soundararajan

Introduction 
It is becoming increasingly challenging to retain and transport the vast amounts of 
visual data that we produce in our daily lives [1]. Because of the coding or conver-
sion, a compressed image ﬁle uses less storage space than the original. Optimises 
the quality of a photo ﬁle while simultaneously shrinking its size. To reduce the 
amount of data required to create an image, image compression in digital picture 
processing is by far the most practical and commercially effective method [2], while 
image reconstruction aids in retrieving the original data that was conveyed. From 
ﬁngerprint compression to signal denoising to medical image processing, wavelets 
have been used since the late 1980s. Reference [3] Depending on the image, the 
wavelet functions that make up a DWT are composed of a sum of different sized and 
positioned elements. In order to construct an image for each of the picture’s 32 × 
32 blocks, the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) applies two ﬁlters to each of 
the image’s 32 × 32 blocks. In image compression and reconstruction applications, 
wavelet transformation techniques are commonly utilised, and they are generally 
regarded as one of the most effective ways.

Review of Literature 
Due to storage and bandwidth limitations, it has been difﬁcult to distribute digital 
photos over great distances. One of the most common ﬁxes for this issue is to 
compress the photos before sending them over the internet [4]. High-speed compres-
sion solutions are needed to keep up with the growing demand for digital images for 
information communication, distribution, storage, and visualisation. Images that are 
compressed using transform techniques are primarily concerned with maximising 
efﬁciency while maintaining an acceptable balance between data compression and 
noise reduction (or noise reduction and compression) [5]. 
There are numerous applications for the transform-based compression method. 
Combining these and other compression methods makes it possible to efﬁciently 
communicate and store images that would otherwise be too large to convey and store 
or show on a screen [6]. It takes less bandwidth to encode transformations than to 
encode other forms of data [7]. The digital elements of the Fourier and Coding trans-
form techniques are employed to convert the original input into frequency domain 
coefﬁcients, which are then translated back into pictures. In addition, the coefﬁcients’ 
ability to compress energy is a plus [8]. 
3 
Methodology & Implementation 
The Methodology is given below as a step by step procedure to solve the considered 
application. 
3.1 
Visual Data Base Collection 
In this work standard images which are most often used in Digital Image Processing 
Applications are concerned [9]. The images such as Lena, Cameraman are preferred 
for implementation and analysis. 
3.2 
Implementation of Algorithms 
The image Compression and reconstruction algorithms for which implementations 
are available will be considered for the purpose [10]. The algorithms for which no 
implementation is available will be adopted as part of the project. 
The preferred programming platform is MATLAB technical computing language 
(R2017a and above) using toolboxes image acquisition, image processing, ﬁxed point 
and neural networks.

97
3.3 
Testing 
The algorithms will be tested on the collected medical visual data base. Some 
algorithms may extract important features from extensive testing. 
3.4 
Analysis 
Using the results of the tests, an assessment of the algorithm will be made. Any 
relative strengths or weaknesses of algorithms should be found. The concepts in the 
algorithms will be assessed for relevance based on the quality of the algorithms with 
reference to considered problem/ application. 
3.5 
Modiﬁed Algorithm 
Based on the analysis, one or more improvements to existing recent Image Compres-
sion and Reconstruction techniques based on Transforms may become apparent. If 
this occurs, a new algorithm will be devised which demonstrates the improvements. 
3.6 
Test Modiﬁed Algorithm 
The improved algorithm will then be evaluated on the basis of the requirements. 
3.7 
Expected Outcome
• Survey and analysis of existing methods.
• Strengths and weaknesses of algorithm in comparison with each other.
• Finally, the research project might result in the creation of a new algorithm that 
combines ideas from the existing image processing techniques. 
When applying the transform methods discussed in the preceding section based on 
available theoretical and practical concepts through simulation, it is discovered that 
Stockwell Transforms can provide superior results in terms of both appearance and 
parametric properties when image reconstruction is performed [11]. The Orthogonal 
Stockwell Transform, which has been previously investigated, is modiﬁed in such a 
way that it yields more favourable outcomes [12]. The basic proposed block diagram 
is as provided in Fig. 1.

98
P. P. Babu et al.
Fig. 1 Proposed method block diagram 
Speciﬁcally, in this improved Stockwell Transform, the standard inputs are 
subjected to the Stockwell Transform’s coefﬁcient generation process, after which 
they are subjected to the bandwidth partitioning procedure as well [13–15]. Because 
of the deconstructing operation carried out in the early stages, the values obtained 
are then put into the proposed approach for transformation, which results in the 
generation of frequency components. In the future, the Quantizer is supposed to 
transform them into a format that may be communicated through a channel or media 
of one’s choosing [16]. Upon receipt of these components, the Inverse Quantizer 
has a tendency to convert them into normal elements at the receiver side, which is 
eventually a stage of image reconstruction once they’ve been obtained.

Experimental Investigation and Analysis 
The proposed algorithm was tested on standard images such as Lena, Cameraman, 
and Barbara, and the corresponding stockwell transform and reconstructed images 
are displayed in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Each sub-band of the image’s Improved Stockwell 
Transform contains a smaller version of the image.
This is due to the fact that the fundamental functions have a stronger relationship 
with the edges, especially at higher frequencies. Because the order of the coefﬁcients

has been ﬂipped in order to ensure conjugate-symmetry, the picture in bands with 
negative frequencies is mirrored in the resulting image.

Conclusion 
This article offers a straightforward technique to formulating a proposal and gaining 
ﬁrst-hand experimental results to validate the proposed block diagram and process. 
In this work, the implementation was carried out on basic standard images of digital 
image processing such as Lena, cameraman, and Barbara for compression and recon-
struction, and visual perception has indicated that the results obtained are of high 
quality.

Introduction 
This year’s COVID-19 epidemic began in Wuhan City in central China’s Hubei 
province in December of 2019 [1]. The World Health Organization declared the 
corona virus’s capabilities after observing the virus’s proliferation and transmission 
among humans [2]. When COVID19 is inhaled, droplets and minute airborne parti-
cles carrying the virus are present. Even while inhaling them close to one’s face 
is risky, it’s possible to do so even at a greater distance indoors [3]. Contaminated 
ﬂuids and contaminated surfaces can potentially spread an infection when they are 
splashed or sprayed into the eyes, nose, or mouth. People can spread the virus even if 
they don’t display any symptoms for up to 20 days after catching the infection [4]. It 
appears that vaccination, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding large 
crowds, maintaining a reasonable distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, 
controlling potential exposure [5]. 
Washing hands frequently and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respira-
tory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes and mouth with unwashed hands all help 
to reduce the risk of contracting an infectious disease [6]. In order to provide policy-
makers and epidemiologists with useful information on the outbreak’s progression, 
it is necessary to track the use of face masks across multiple locales [7]. As long as 
people are wearing face masks and the COVID-19 virus and any other undiscovered 
viruses are being monitored, it’s critical to have an emergency beacon alert so that 
the rest of society can take action [8]. A face mask identiﬁcation algorithm has been 
developed for COVID-19 in order to detect the use of face masks in inhabited areas. 
Social space regulations and validating people’s face masks are both time-consuming

and uncomfortable, making it difﬁcult to keep track of them [9]. This can save you 
money, but it can also lead to an increase in human errors as a side effect. In addition 
to ﬁnding a virus management solution, ﬁguring out what social distance rules to 
follow is a must [10]. The general population is keeping an eye on things [11, 12]. 
Even social distance is considered. In order to make a determination, it is necessary 
to recognize and classify contraventions and face masks [13, 14]. The citizens’ safety 
is ensured by ensuring that an acceptable and appropriate distance is maintained, and 
face masks must be kept clean if they are damaged [15, 16].

Methodology 
The bounding box technique is used to detect face masks. Box with a boundary. 
A bounding box is a ﬁctitious rectangle that serves as a reference point for object 
detection and generates a collision box for that object. Data annotators draw these 
rectangles over images, deﬁning the X and Y coordinates of the object of interest 
within each image. The bounding box is rectangular, as determined by the x and y 
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the rectangle and the lower-right corner’s x 
and y coordinates. The (x, y)-axis coordinates of the bounding box centre, as well as 
the width and height of the box, are another typical bounding box representation. The 
image is extracted after the coordinates have been mapped. The image is converted 
from HSV to RGB. A color’s value is the highest amount of brightness it can have. 
It is, in fact, proportional to the brightness of the brightest subpixel in the RGB 
colour. If one represents a value in the range [0, 1], then a value of 1 means that the 
brightest subpixel in a 24-bit RGB colour has the value 0 × FF (255). A value of 
0 indicates that the brightest subpixel has a value of 0, implying that all subpixels 
have a value of 0, implying that the colour is black. Saturation is a depiction of the 
variance between subpixels, which corresponds to what humans perceive as a color’s 
“vibrancy”. The closer the brightness of subpixels are to one another, the more the 
colour appears grayscale. Saturation is the ratio of the brightness of the dimmest 
subpixel to the brightness of the brightest subpixel in RGB colour. If you want to 
know the precise range of possible brightnesses within a pixel, multiply the Value 
and Saturation together, getting a value known as Chroma. For example, if the Value 
is 0.5 and the Saturation is 0.5, the Chroma is 0.25, corresponding to a 0.25 * 255 
= 64 difference between the brightest and darkest subpixel. We know the brightest 
subpixel has value 128 = 0 × 80 because the value is 0.5. Subtraction of the scaled 
Chroma yields a value of 64 = 0 × 40 for the dimmest subpixel. Saturation = 0.5 
means that the dimmest subpixel is exactly half as bright as the brightest subpixel. 
As a result, if Saturation = 0, all subpixels will have the same brightness, resulting 
in a grayscale colour. The image will be transformed into a binary image when it 
has been converted. A binary image is made up of pixels that can only have one of 
two colours, commonly black and white. Binary graphics are also known as bi-level 
or two-level images, while two-color pixelart is known as 1-Bit or 1bit. This means 
that each pixel is saved as a single bit—a 0 or a 1. An image’s pixels are made up of

105
binary numbers. If we state that 1 is black (or on) and 0 is white (or off), then we can 
use binary to build a simple black and white image. Further image postprocessing is 
performed using blob statistical analysis.

Design and Process Flow of Implementation 
The images in this study will be imported from a database, as illustrated in Fig. 1. 
In order to process. The input photos are then supplied into the colour map process, 
which converts the RGB images to grayscale images for easy and convenient 
processing and manipulation. Later, the transformed image is positioned so that 
the number of items may be easily detected. 
Binary conversion of the image is performed for improved image analysis. The 
image is subjected to blob statistics analysis, which determines the centroid of the 
image, as well as the length and direction of the lumps. Finally, the image is run 
through the bounding box algorithm.

Experimental Investigations 
The experimental implementation is processed in this study utilising the simulation 
tool MATLAB and basic toolboxes. In this case, the input image as shown in Fig. 2 
is transformed from HSV to RGB as shown in Fig. 3, and the converted input is 
converted from RGB to Gray model for easier processing during image segmentation 
as shown in Fig. 4. These input photos, after going through the relevant colour map 
and binary image methods, are given into the Blob analysis. It is the most fundamental 
image processing approach for examining an object’s shape properties, such as the 
presence, number, area, position, length, and orientation of lumps as shown in Figs. 5, 
6 and 7. The acquired outputs are then fed into the bounding box. 
The number of images in the item is identiﬁed by the bounding box. The rectangle 
coordinates are drawn on the item based on those. The output of the image will be 
determined based on the aspected ratio, as shown in Fig. 8.

Conclusion 
Extensive experimentation on a variety of images is shown, as is the performance 
evaluation of the proposed method. When we detect the face mask, the bounding 
box technique allows us to assist in identifying the object extremely precisely. The 
simplest technique presented in this study has been empirically conﬁrmed for iden-
tifying the wearing of face masks and classifying the type of masks, which helps 
protect public health and plays a beneﬁcial role in promoting the pandemic. Face 
restoration using PCA, SVM, and other machine learning algorithms that can recreate 
the face hidden behind the face mask could be the focus of future research in this 
ﬁeld.

Introduction 
Hard lithography, Short-channel effects, and a considerable rise in power dissipa-
tion are all issues for CMOS-based systems [1]. QCA is among the most signiﬁcant 
nanotechnologies proposed as a potential replacement for CMOS devices [2, 3]. 
Lenten et al. [4] proposed the concept of QCA in 1993. QCA has been physically 
implemented using four models: magnetic, Metal Island, molecular, as well as semi-
conductor [1], & numerous studies have lately described novel implementation break-
throughs [5, 6]. The fundamental building components of QCA are indeed an inverter 
as well as a majority voter. Many studies proposed this strategy for constructing a 
new majority gate conﬁguration. The development of an appropriate majority gate 
structure enhance the effectiveness of the QCA circuit. Other strategies for optimising 
QCA circuits have been proposed, including such [7, 8]. Memory architecture piqued 
the attention of academics, particularly in QCA. QCA, like VLSI, includes a plethora 
of factors for evaluating circuit performance, such as latency, power dissipation, as 
well as area. The dependability of QCA circuits seems to be very crucial and must be 
carefully studied [9]. This study suggested a novel majority voter structure having 
three inputs and used it to build a new reduced power RAM cellular components. A 
power dissipation study is also given. The suggested architecture offers many advan-
tages, including decreased power consumption, a small footprint, and single-layer 
implementations. Furthermore, the inputs are located outside the design, avoiding

ples of QCA are reviewed in Sect. 2, the current SRAM is evaluated in Sect. 3, the  
suggested designs are examined in Sect. 4, and also the simulated results as well as 
conclusion are presented in Sects. 5 and 6, consecutively.

QCA Overview 
QCA circuits are quite often constructed utilizing QCA cells, that are similar 
elements. The QCA cell, as shown in Fig. 1, is formed like that of a square having four 
dots at every corner containing two charged electrons which may freely travel across 
them. The coulombic force causes electrons to move towards the dots on directly 
opposite corners. Each cell is rather different since it carries the right quantity of 
charge. The quantum dot appers to be a nm size semi—conducting nanostructure 
component with a 2–10 nm diameter. Valence electrons may move to other quantum 
dots via tunneling through QCA cell [10, 11]. 
As a result of columbic reactions, two different polarizations may develop. Every 
cell retains two extra free electrons within antipodal zones owing to Coulombic 
forces. As little more than a result, the suitable states ‘0’ as well as ‘1’ each have 
two alternative ground stages having linear polarisation coefﬁcients of ‘1’ as well as 
‘−1’, accordingly. 
The inverter & majority gate constitute two crucial parts of each and every QCA 
circuit. In actuality, the two most prominent logic gates within QCA are indeed an 
inverter as well as a three-majority gate. Figure 2 illustrates an inverter design, while 
Fig. 3 depicts a three-majority gate. Using QCA technology, all logical operations 
are performed using an inverter as well as a three-majority. If the inverter gate or 
even the three majority gates were previously used as an important gate throughout 
circuit design, study has shown that three majority gate generally underused in tech-
nology mapping. Numerous scholars are still researching novel logic gates in order 
to improve circuit efﬁciency [12, 13]. The functioning of this gate is shown in Eq. 
(1) Maj  (A, B, C)  = AB + AC + BC.
The polarization of the central cell is determined by the 3- input cells of the 
Majority Voter, as well as the output received is the Majority Vote Polarity. Majority

Using the Three Input Majority Gate, several researchers have constructed both 
Combinational and Sequential Circuits. The QCA Designer programme was used 
to develop and evaluate the QCA structures using two distinct simulation engines 
[14–16]. Figures 4, 5, 6 show implementations of 3-input majority gates, or & and 
gates.

Existing RAM Cell 
Developing the RAM cell would be a key issue in QCA Nano-technique. Generally 
practice, there have been two mechanisms for storing bits in QCA technology: loop-
based as well as line-based. Moving the bit back across four time zones would retain 
it in a loop-based method. The prior value, but in the other side, was stored through 
a process known as line-based by employing the QCA line design. Figure 7 shows 
the fundamental RAM cell schematic diagram [15, 16].

Proposed RAM Cell 
A majority gate would be a customised gate that generates output that is comparable 
to the majority of inputs logic levels. Unless the majority of the gate’s sources are ‘1’, 
then the majority’s out is ‘1’; otherwise, the out is 0. The logic architecture for the 
majority gate-based memory module is depicted in Fig. 8. The developed memory 
cell consists primarily of a write/read, a select, an input, as well as an output signals. 
If utilised in a wide array, a select line would be used as a row /column selection. To 
pick a cell, connect the row/column decoder output to the selection line. If Select = 
‘0’, the output is ‘0’ regardless of other input signals.
This indicates that perhaps the cell could not be used for memory operations 
and also that the circuitry would be in the hold mode. If Select = ‘1’, the write 
and read operations are carried out depending on the Write/Read’ inputs. If Write/ 
Read’ equals to ‘1’, then Write operation is carried out. Unless the input is ‘1’, the 
Q becomes ‘1’ since the majority of the input to the majority gate represent ‘1’, and 
vice versa for writing ‘0’. Throughout a read operation, the Write/Read’ equals ‘0’ 
as well as the Q would be in hold mode, reading the previously stored data. Figure 9

To get the entire Memory cell architecture, many fundamental gates such as AND, 
OR, NOT, and Majority gates are created and combined. All of the cells’ clocking 
has indeed been designed in a manner that we obtain undistorted output.

Simulation Results 
To construct the SRAM cell, a Majority gate was integrated into the design. A QCA 
Designer-E tool was used to create the Majority circuit SRAM cell, as well as its 
output Read/Write functionalities were conﬁrmed. 
Write operation: The selection line & Write/Read inputs are maintained high during 
Writing operation. The output is given or low depending on the input value. Unless 
the input would be a ‘1’, the majority of an input to a Majority gate are also ‘1’, 
and the output would be high. Likewise, if indeed the input equals ‘0’, the Majority 
gate’s majority inputs are low, and so the out is low. Clock 1 is acquiring the output. 
Read operation: The Write/Read inputs is maintained low throughout the Read 
operation, while the Selection line is driven up. The output would follows the memory 
loop Q bit regardless of the value of the parameter. Figure 10 depicts the output 
operation. 
The comparison of Basic SRAM and Majority-Gate based SRAM is shown in 
Table 1. 
Performance/energy measurements have been used to assess the performance of 
SRAMs based on Basic & Majority Gates. As compared to regular SRAM, Majority-
Gate SRAM consumes less power as well as energy.

Conclusion 
We present a new majority-3 gate conﬁguration. The majority gate would be used 
to create a one-of-a-kind QCA-RAM cell with power to set or reset its output. The 
QCADesigner tool would be used for circuit design and implementation in this work, 
whereas the QCAPro programme is used for power analysis. The proposed structure 
have always had the following beneﬁts: compact size, low consumed power, low cost, 
plus simple implementation. The recommended circuits are much more realistic for 
physical implementation since they are constructed on a single layer.

Optimization of Area and Wirelength 
Using Hybrid BPSO Algorithm in VLSI 
Floorplan and Placement for IC Design

Introduction 
As the market for cutting-edge technology grows, more research is being done in 
the ﬁeld of IC design, resulting in VLSI designs that are more composite, reliable, 
compact, and perform better [1, 2]. The amount of transistors in a single chip has 
increased signiﬁcantly, which has greatly complicated IC design. Floorplanning, 
a fundamental physical design phase for hierarchical, building-block design tech-
niques [3, 4], is a more sophisticated solution to the aforementioned challenge. It is 
challenging to determine the global solution space since the solution space expands 
together with the size of the circuit. The Hybrid BPSO technique can be used to 
handle the problem of ﬂoorplanning [5]. 
1.1 
Background 
It is difﬁcult to notice early feedback in the context of IC physical design in order to 
predict the area, latency, wire length, and so on prior to IC manufacture [6].

Objectives 
There is a signiﬁcant difﬁculty in the arena of IC physical design to discover early 
feedback to predict the area, wire length, latency, and so on before IC manufacture 
[7]. 
1.3 
Need and Importance
• According to Moore’s law, the number of components on modern ICs has 
increased around two times every two years.
• As a result, producing an optimal ﬂoorplan becomes impossible and must rely on 
certain valuable algorithms. 
2 
Literature Review 
The authors of [8] discuss PSO using a polish expressing themselves to ﬁx modules 
alongside a ﬁxed outline constraint and a hybrid ant colony optimisation approach 
which may reduce computation time as well as provide better ﬂoor-plan arrange-
ments. The latter approach focuses on creating a more suitable ﬂoor-plan in less 
time. 
To reach both a global and local optimum, [9] offer a hybrid strategy combining 
PSO with Harmony Search (HS). The ﬁndings indicate that there is an ideal solution 
for a larger number of modules. 
Reference [10] To explore the search space and ﬁnd a workable solution, the 
researcher offers a discrete PSO (DPSO) technique. 
For non-slicing ﬂoor layouts, [11] propose a hybrid particle swarm and ant colony 
optimisation (PSO/ACO) strategy to obtain the optimal result. 
2.1 
Drawbacks
• The PSO method has the drawback of having a sluggish rate of convergence 
during repeated processes and being easy to slip towards a local optimum within 
a high-dimensional environment [12].
• It generates low-quality solutions and necessitates the use of memory to update 
velocity [13].
• If the problem is discrete, PSO isn’t as effective [14].

Methodology 
3.1 
Existing Method 
The fundamental PSO is a search method based on a stochastic population. It is 
considered to be a workable option to the majority of challenging non-linear optimi-
sation problems. It was initially introduced by Drs. Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995. 
The comparison is based on a ﬂock of birds and insects moving about in a search 
space for search of food. These birds and insects do not know where the best location 
is inside the search space [15–18]. Through their social conduct, one individual can 
show the other group members a desired way, and they will quickly copy them. To 
address optimization problems, this approach is derived from animal behaviour or 
activity [19–21]. 
Particles in the PSO swarm communicate with each other to ﬁnd suitable places. 
Based on the optimal position of every particle in the swarm, they adjust their posi-
tions and speeds in real time. All particles throughout the search space look for better 
locations up until the swarm gets close to the optimal ﬁtness function. The PSO algo-
rithm’s success can be ascribed to its simplicity in use and capacity to converge on 
a better solution. It doesn’t consider the gradient information of the function; it only 
uses mathematical operators. The basic PSO is not much effective when it is discrete 
in nature [22–24]. 
3.2 
Proposed Method 
In the proposed methodology, combing of both PSO and BAT algorithms properties 
will be done to provide better optimal solutions which can be termed as Hybrid Bat & 
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The underlying PSO algorithm motivates 
the proposed optimisation approach. In this example, the population is represented 
by the number of pieces to be put in a ﬂoor plan space. All parameters, including 
optimisation iterations, population size, learning coefﬁcients and inertia weights must 
be loaded at the start. The modules were rectangular in shape and vary in size; both 
the height and width of each module must be determined prior to the optimisation 
process. Because each particle travels at a different speed, a velocity matrix has 
exactly the same amount of rows and columns that the number of modules. 
Swap, rotate, and move are the three major operations performed by the PSO on 
the particles/modules [25, 26]. When two particles exchange locations, they do so 
with the idea that the new position is the best ﬁt for them. If the optimum position 
may be occupied, the individual particle must alter its position or rotate at right angles 
in order to move and rotate. Until all of the particles are in the ideal location or the 
termination condition is reached, all of the particles conduct these three processes as 
shown in Fig. 1. The number of iterations is the termination condition.

Fig. 1 Flowchart of BPSO 
The typical BA involves four basic parameters: pulse frequency, pulse rate, 
velocity, and a constant. There is no limit to variegate the BA over mutation accep-
tance, parameter assortment, or hybridizing the bat algorithm with other algorithms 
to improve the local search capabilities and maintain population divergence so that 
the algorithm avoids trapping in local optima. Although, the problem with the BA 
modiﬁcation method is that it never ensures that a modiﬁed BA ﬁnds a worldwide 
optimum solution. 
Hence by combining the properties like pulse frequency, pulse rate, velocity, 
swapping, rotation resulting in the Hybrid BPSO Algorithm which produces very 
optimal solutions compared to other algorithms.

Results and Discussion 
MATLAB R2017a is used to implement the HPSO algorithm for VLSI ﬂoorplan opti-
mization. Set the number of blocks and the maximum number of iterations required 
for the optimization. For each new optimization problem, certain parameters must 
be deﬁned, such as the population or swarm size, the width and height of the parent 
module (W and H), the width and height of modules (w and h), random points on 
modules (rin and rout), spacing between modules (d), and the velocity matrix, which 
is a n*n matrix where n corresponds to the number of particles.

Conclusion 
A Hybrid BPSO technique for VLSI ﬂoor-plan optimization is implemented in this 
study. The results of the experiments suggest that Hybrid BPSO is the optimum 
ﬂoorplan optimization approach. When compared to other existing approaches, it 
gives better outcomes. To test the viability, the implementation was ﬁrst carried out 
on a few modules with a smaller ﬂoor-plan space. In comparison to the initial ﬂoor-
plan area, an improvement in area was gained for ﬂoor-plans with a certain number 
of modules. The elapsed time is long because the number of iterations was set to 
1000.

Introduction 
Mobile communication has rapidly increased because of the demand of high data rates 
and throughputs. In order to achieve error-free high bit rates, multi-carrier transmis-
sion methods are utilised in current wireless mobile systems [1]. The application of 
multi-carrier modulation (MCM) has developed into a common method for accom-
plishing this goal. OFDM, which stands for orthogonal frequency division multi-
plexing, is the most well-known example of MCM transmission [2]. The common 
orthogonal frequencies-division multiplexing (OFDM) electronic modulation tech-
nique is a multi-user orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). 
OFDMA provides multiple access by allocating individual users portions of subcar-
riers. This enables multiple users to send low-data-rate messages at the same time [3]. 
However, both OFDM and OFDMA suffer from power distortion, which can be espe-
cially problematic in uplink transmissions. Because of its lower power distortion and 
lower BER and SER, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) 
was chosen as the uplink multiple access scheme to overcome this limitation [4]. 
SC-FDMA is used because its peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) is smaller and 
more constant. Furthermore, it has a comparable throughput and, for the most part, 
the same overall complexity as an orthogonal frequency division multiple access 
(OFDMA) system [5].

G. Obulesu et al.
Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) is a frequency-division multi-access system. 
It’s sometimes referred to as linear precoded OFDMA (LP-OFDMA). It, like other 
multiple access methods (TDMA, CDMA, FDMA, and OFDMA), deals with the 
assignment of numerous users to a common communication resource. Because it 
adds an extra DFT processing step preceding the standard OFDMA processing, 
SC-FDMA may be regarded of as a linear precoded OFDMA scheme [6]. 
SC-FDMA has gained traction as a viable alternative to OFDMA, especially in 
upstream communications where a reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) 
helps the mobile device in terms of transmission power consumption and power 
ampliﬁer cost [7]. It is utilised in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), additionally 
referred to as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA) [8], as the uplink multiple access technique. 
Several studies have been conducted on the performance of SC-FDMA in compar-
ison to OFDMA. Despite the small performance difference, Because of its low 
PAPR, SC-FDMA is ideal towards uplink wireless data transfer in mobile telephone 
networks wherein transmitter power consumption is crucial. 
2 
Literature Review 
This study compares two single-carrier frequency-division multiple access 
(SCFDMA) methods for a satellite uplink, namely localised FDMA (LFDMA) and 
interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) to orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA). The latter uses the 
digital television broadcasting (DVB) standards family for its air interface [9]. Using 
two cutting-edge high power ampliﬁers (HPAs) working in the K- and S-bands, the 
effectiveness of both asynchronous as well as synchronous LFDMA, IFDMA, and 
OFDMA within a multi-user scenario is examined. While IFDMA beats the other two 
systems for synchronous receiving, it is the most vulnerable to deterioration resulting 
from inter-block interference (IBI) for asynchronously reception (IBI) [10]. Further-
more, because to its relatively signiﬁcant envelope variations, OFDMA is the most 
prone to non-linear distortion [11]. Although LFDMA beats IFDMA for synchronous 
receiving, it outperforms both systems for asynchronous reception, particularly with 
higher IBI distortion [12]. 
3 
Methodology and Process Flow 
The transmission processing of SC-FDMA is quite similar to that of OFDMA. Each 
user’s bit sequence is mapped to a complicated constellation of symbols (BPSK, 
QPSK, or MQuadrature amplitude modulation) [13]. Then, various Fourier coefﬁ-
cients are allocated to various transmitters (users) [14]. The act of mapping then 
demapping blocks accomplish this process. The receiver side comprises one demap-
ping block and one IDFT block, and a single detecting block for each user signals 
to be received. Guard intervals with cyclic repetition are provided among blocks

of symbols, exactly like in OFDM, to effectively minimise interference between 
symbols caused by temporal spreading (produced by multi-path propagation) within 
the blocks [15]. 
SC-FDMA allows for multiple user access by allocating multiple sets and 
non overlapping Fourier components to various users (sub-carriers) [16]. This is 
performed at the transmitter by injecting quiet Fourier coefﬁcients (at places allotted 
to other users) before doing the IDFT and deleting them on the receiver side after 
the DFT. 
SC-FDMA is distinct from OFDMA in that it generates a single-carrier broadcast 
signal, whereas OFDMA uses multiple carriers [17]. Subcarrier mapping is classi-
ﬁed into two types: localised mapping and spread mapping. The DFT outputs are 
assigned to a selection of successive subcarriers via localised mapping, restricting 
the bandwidth they use to a portion of the entire system’s bandwidth. The DFT output 
of the input information are non-continuously allocated to subcarriers throughout the 
whole bandwidth in dispersed mapping, leading to zero amplitude for each of the 
leftover subcarriers [18]. 
Interleaved SC-FDMA (IFDMA) is a distributed SC-FDMA variation whereby 
the occupied subcarriers are separated evenly throughout the whole bandwidth [19]. 
SC-FDMA offers a smaller peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) over OFDM and 
OFDMA due to its intrinsic single carrier structure, allowing for more relaxed design 
requirements in a subscriber unit’s transmit channel. Unlike OFDM, which imme-
diately modulates multiple subcarriers with transmit symbols, SC-FDMA broadcast 
symbols undergo initial processing through an N-point DFT blocks [20]. 
Following the DFT computation, equalisation is performed on the receiving side 
in OFDM and SC-FDMA through doubling each Fourier component by a complex 
integer. As a consequence, frequency-selective fading with phase distortion may be 
avoided with relative ease. The use of FFTs for bandwidth-domain equalisation has 
the beneﬁt of requiring less computation than conventional time-domain equalisation, 
which necessitates multi-tap FIR or IIR-ﬁlters. With fewer calculations, there is less 
compounding round-off error, often known as numeric noise [21]. 
Combining a single carrier’s transmission with a single-carrier frequencydomain-
equalization (SC-FDE) technique is a similar concept. Single carrier transmission, 
unlike SC-FDMA and OFDM, does not employ IDFT or DFT at the transmitting 
device, instead applying the cyclic preﬁx to change the linear channel combination 
into a circular one. After removing the cyclic preﬁx from the receiver, a DFT is 
utilised to enter the domain of frequency, where a basic single-carrier frequency-
domain-equalization (SC-FDE) method, following by the IDFT operation, can be 
applied. 
Figure 1 depicts an OFDMA and SC-FDMA block diagram. SC-FDMA adds one 
more module, DFT, before the IFFT component in the transmitter’s chain, and IDFT 
in the reception chain. This converts the OFDMA chain to a SC-FDMA chain. In the 
event of an absence of both of these modules, the chain is referred to as the OFDMA 
communication and reception chain.
DFT outputs are allotted to M successive subcarriers from an aggregate of N 
subcarriers in LFDMA (where N>M). In contrast, DFDMA spreads the M amount

of DFT outputs throughout the whole band. As illustrated in Figure 2, each DFDMA 
and LFDMA allocate null amplitude to (N-M) vacant subcarriers. The mapping of 
the mode is referred to as interleave FDMA (IFDMA) if all of the DFT output are 
dispersed with an equivalent distance N/M=Q among the occupied subcarriers. Q 
has been identiﬁed as the bandwidth spread factor.

Results and Analysis 
The recommended techniques are put into action using the MATLAB computer-aided 
design tool. The tool version utilised in this study effort is r2017b, which includes 
the necessary communication along with signal processing toolboxes. 
SER versus SNR (in dB) for SC-FDMA System 
We have used the following data for our analysis:
• 64-QAM modulated signals
• FFT/IFFT length = 512
• Input-data block size = 32
• Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) Length = 20
• SNR psi[0, 30 dB] 
To evaluate the SER versus SNR (in dB) performance of SCFDMA System three 
different channels were used, which are pedAchannel, vehAchannel and AWGN 
channel. Furthermore, the plots were plotted for 3 different subcarrier mapping: 
localised FDMA (LFDMA), interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) and distributed FDMA 
(DFDMA). 
A. pedAchannel 
While using pedAchannel for SCFDMA, from Fig. 3 and Table 1, it is observed 
that the SER performance of LFDMA is better than IFDMA and DFDMA tech-
nique because of its robustness against multiple carrier interference. Also DFDMA 
and IFDMA are almost the same in their SER performance (and hence are over-
lapped when plotted in single ﬁgure).It is observed that the performance is greatly 
improved with SCFDMA as compared to OFDMA for all three subcarrier techniques 
in pedAchannel.

B. vehAchannel 
While using vehAchannel for OFDMA, from Fig. 4 and Table 2, it is observed that the 
SER performance of LFDMA is a lot better than IFDMA and DFDMA technique 
because of its robustness against multiple carrier interference. Also DFDMA and 
IFDMA are almost the same in their SER performance (and hence are overlapped 
when plotted in single ﬁgure). When compared to pedAchannel, the LFDMA perfor-
mance is slightly better in vehAchannel but IFDMA and DFDMA performance is 
better for pedAchannel. When compared to vehChannel performance of OFDMA, 
a great improvement in SER performance is observed. Also, it must be noted that 
vehChannel performance of SCFDMA is better than the performance of OFDMA in 
all three channels. 
C. AWGN Channel 
While using the AWGN channel for OFDMA, from Fig. 5 and Table 3, it is observed 
that the SER performance of LFDMA, IFDMA and DFDMA is almost similar. When 
compared to pedAchannel, there is a reduction in SER performance of LFDMA in

AWGN channel but SER performance IFDMA and DFDMA is better for AWGN 
channel. When compared to vehAchannel, there is a reduction in SER performance 
of LFDMA in AWGN channel but SER performance IFDMA and DFDMA is consid-
erably better for AWGN channel. Also, it must be noted that the AWGN performance 
of SCFDMA is better than the performance of OFDMA in all three channels. 
PAPR Performance for SCFDMA System 
We have used the following data for our analysis:
• 16-QAM modulated signals
• FFT/IFFT length = 512
• Input-data block size = 32 
To evaluate the PAPR performance of SCFDMA System three different subcar-
rier mapping were used, which are localised FDMA (LFDMA), interleaved FDMA 
(IFDMA) and distributed FDMA (DFDMA).

From Fig. 6 and Table 4, it is observed that the PAPR performance of LFDMA 
and DFDMA is almost similar in case of SCFDMA and IFDMA gives a better 
performance as compared to LFDMA and DFDMA in OFDMA. It was observed that 
the PAPR performance of SCFDMA signiﬁcantly improved in all three subcarrier 
mapping techniques i.e LFDMA, IFDMA and DFDMA, when compared to their 
counterparts in OFDMA.

mapping. (right side ﬁgure is added as a subplot to show the values as they are 
overlapped in left one) 
Conclusion: In this project we have focused on the performance analysis of 
OFDMA and SCFDMA systems in terms of SER and PAPR. Three types of channel 
(pedAchannel, vehAchannel and AWGN channel) were introduced along with two 
types of subcarrier mapping (localised and distributed, IFDMA is a special case of 
DFDMA). 
It was concluded that the PAPR performance of SCFDMA was signiﬁcantly better 
in all three subcarrier mapping techniques i.e LFDMA, IFDMA and DFDMA, when 
compared to their counterparts in OFDMA.

Introduction 
In terms of meeting client needs, the restaurant is one of the most important aspects 
of the food service sector as well as a part of tourism. The restaurant is organised into 
several sections, one of which is the canteen [1]. A canteen is a cafeteria found in 
workplaces, factories, and schools where employees and students can eat lunch, take 
a break with refreshments, or study while on the job [2]. The inﬂux of customers at 
various times of the day has caused a backlog in food payments. A line may form if 
the facility’s capacity to provide the service exceeds the quantity of demand. Queues 
are common in restaurants during lunch and dinner [3]. 
Due to the vast array of food varieties, image recognition of food products is 
frequently difﬁcult [4]. The goal of food detection is to make paying at restaurants 
easier, and automatic food price estimation is accomplished through the use of the 
network [5]. We applied AlexNet to food identiﬁcation and recognition tasks using 
image processing techniques. We created a dataset of the most common food products 
in kaggle and used it to test recognition skills. The network categorises the train and 
test data and outputs the classiﬁcation results.

Literature Review 
Modern food identiﬁcation applications depend heavily on emerging techniques to 
food categorization. For this reason, a new food recognition algorithm is offered that 
considers the shape, colour, size, and texture of the object [6]. A more accurate classi-
ﬁcation can be achieved by combining these criteria in different ways. Segmentation 
and classiﬁcation are this application’s two primary procedures. Segmentation is the 
technique of breaking a digital image up into various pieces in image processing [7]. 
By lowering an image’s complexity, segmentation aims to increase its meaning. 
The major objective of this strategy is to use a network to identify food and 
determine total costs. The data is trained using the AlexNet algorithm [8]. Using 
image processing methods, labels are applied to the input image, and a bounding 
box is created. The network makes a distinction between the test image and the train 
dataset. 
In order to clarify the detection processes utilised for identifying the underlying 
concerns and emphasise the preventative steps to solve the problem, a comparative 
study of food intake detection using artiﬁcial neural networks and support vector 
machines was carried out in [9]. 
The Real-Time Mobile Food Recognition System, which is detailed in [10], 
explains the important aspects of the numerous issues that must be resolved in the 
Realtime environment.

Methodology 
3.1 
Existing Method 
Finding objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in photographs is a common 
usage of image segmentation [11, 12]. Pixels in the same area share characteristics 
like colour or texture. In this application, foods with similar constituents will be 
grouped together in the same segment. Therefore, dividing the meal into distinct 
portions helps the classiﬁer get the right answer [13, 14]. Taking an image and 
performing segmentation may seem simple, but a strong model is necessary to achieve 
outstanding results during the segmentation and classiﬁcation phases [15]. 
3.2 
Proposed Method 
This study employs a technique to enhance the identiﬁcation of by training a wider 
sample of images and calculating the total cost of the meal. The dataset is trained using 
AlexNet, which also carries out classiﬁcation. The block diagram for the suggested

Food Detection with Image Processing Using Convolutional Neural …
143
method, which is depicted in Fig. 1, describes how the work is done based on training 
and testing methods.
The process of transforming a grayscale image into a bi-level image is known 
as image binarization. Black and white pixels are the two categories into which 
pixels in an image are separated. The primary goal of picture binarization is to divide 
an image into the foreground and background. In essence, it turns the image’s 256 
shades of grey into just two—black and white—creating a binary image. In response 
to the set of qualities speciﬁed by attributes, it delivers measurements for each of 
the eight connected components (objects) in the binary picture, BW. Each photo 
object is represented by a Struct in the Stats structure array. Both contiguous and 
discontiguous territories can employ region props. 
Alex Net: 
Using a convolutional neural network, Alex Net classiﬁed a fresh set of pictures. 
Alex Net can categorise photos into over a thousand different object categories after 
training on over a million photographs as shown in Fig. 2. The network includes a 
wealth of features for a wide variety of pictures.
The image layer input of a convolutional neural network speciﬁes the input pixels 
and comprises of the raw input values of the images. Utilize the image Input function 
to create a layer. In the input Size argument, specify the hue of your image. The ﬁrst 
layer to extract attributes from an input image is convolution. The inputs needed are 
an image matrix and a ﬁlter or kernel. The output matrix is presented in Fig. 3 and 
the matrix multiplication is depicted in Fig. 4.
A convolutional layer’s neurons were connected to the layer preceding it. A convo-
lutional layer learns the information localised by these regions while scanning over a 
picture. The pixels of these zones can be speciﬁed using the ﬁlter Size input argument 
in the call to the convolution2dLayer function. 
One can additionally add zero to the vertical and horizontal picture output by 
using the ‘Padding’ name-value pair option. Padding involves extending the borders 
of the image input by zeros in either rows or columns. It supports modifying the 
layer’s output. 
This value must be an integer in order for the complete image to be covered. The 
software will by default ignore any remaining portions of the image if the combination 
of these parameters is unable to completely cover them.

Conclusion 
Using deep learning techniques and visual processing, the suggested method may 
identify the food. The network is trained using the Kaggle dataset. Existing technolo-
gies can process, assess, and recognise fruits and meals based on colour and texture 
cues. We were able to increase the adaptability and capabilities of the recognition 
system using AlexNet. A signiﬁcant amount of data augmentation is required, in 
addition to learning the generalised pattern required to identify and recognise food

Introduction 
Mobile phones have recently shown to be helpful in our daily lives, especially with 
the increased availability and decreased cost. In many ﬁelds, machine learning has 
been used extensively to identify patterns in data and learn from them in order to 
make precise predictions. In our daily lives, machine learning is used frequently, 
particularly by email providers to identify spam messages. Due to the vast amount 
of data that must be analyzed, understanding and reaching the right decisions can be 
difﬁcult as a result of the recent increase in data. Making accurate decisions can also 
be difﬁcult because the data is available in so many different formats. The company’s 
primary app store, Google Play Store, is used daily by millions of users. It allows

Literature Review 
2.1 
Random Forest Algorithm Based on Data 
Classiﬁcation—Machine Learning 
Random forest is a renowned computational learning framework that makes use of 
the supervised training method. It may be used to solve categorization and regression-
related ML problems [1]. According to the concept of collaborative learning, which 
is the integration of several classiﬁers to solve a complex problem and improve the 
efﬁciency of an algorithm [2], as shown in Fig. 1, it relies on the situation. 
Results: 
After merging the outcomes of all test models, the ﬁnal decision is made based 
on a majority vote [3]. Aggression is the process of collecting all the ﬁndings and 
producing output based on the majority opinion [4]. So this can handle binary, contin-
uous, and categorical data. The output results can be obtained by importing the 
libraries, importing the data sets and putting feature variables to target variables,

Machine Learning’s role in classiﬁcation of data: 
Limitations: 
While random forest may be utilized for both regression and classiﬁcation methods 
which was demonstrated in Fig. 2, it is not better suited for Regression activities. 
2.2 
Classiﬁcation of Data Using Decision Tree 
Classiﬁer-Machine Learning Techniques 
Decision Tree Classiﬁer is a popular machine learning technique used for classi-
ﬁcation tasks. It creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible conse-
quences, which helps in classifying new data points based on their features. Here’s 
a step-by-step guide on how to perform data classiﬁcation using a Decision Tree 
Classiﬁer: 
Data Preparation: Start by preparing your dataset for classiﬁcation. Ensure that 
your data is in a structured format, with rows representing individual samples and 
columns representing features. Additionally, make sure that your dataset is labeled, 
meaning that each sample has a corresponding class or category assigned to it. 
Feature Selection: Choose the pertinent characteristics from your dataset that will be 
utilized for categorization in the feature choice step. The issue domain and the type

150
J. C. Babu et al.
of data both inﬂuence the feature selection. The precision of the categorization model 
depends heavily on the choice of informational and discriminatory characteristics. 
Splitting the Dataset: The set used for training and the testing set should be separated 
from your dataset. The decision tree classiﬁer will be constructed using the set for 
training, and its effectiveness will be assessed using the set for testing. Usually, 
between 70 and 80% of the data are in the training set, while between 20 and 30% 
are in the set used for testing. 
Building the Decision Tree: Create a decision tree classiﬁer using the training set 
as the basis. The decision tree method divides the data recursively depending on the 
chosen characteristics to produce a tree-like structure. The most popular approach for 
creating decision trees is the CART (Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees) algorithm, 
which chooses the optimal split at each node using a metric like impurity from Gini 
or entropy. 
Training the Decision Tree: Train the decision tree classiﬁer using the training 
set. The algorithm learns the patterns and relationships between the features and 
the corresponding classes. It iteratively splits the data based on feature values to 
maximize the purity of each resulting branch. 
Evaluating the Decision Tree: Once the decision tree is trained, evaluate its perfor-
mance using the testing set. Pass the testing set through the decision tree, and compare 
the predicted classes with the actual classes in the dataset. Common evaluation 
metrics for classiﬁcation models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
Tuning and Pruning: By modifying hyper parameters like the maximum depth of the 
tree and the bare minimum number of information needed to divide a node, you may 
ﬁne-tune the decision tree classiﬁer. Pruning, a method used to prevent overﬁtting, 
which enhances the model’s capacity for generalization. 
Predicting New Data: Finally, you can use the trained decision tree classiﬁer to 
predict the classes of new, unseen data points. Simply pass the new data through the 
decision tree, following the decision rules at each node, until you reach a leaf node 
that corresponds to the predicted class. 
That’s the basic workﬂow for performing data classiﬁcation using a Decision Tree 
Classiﬁer. Remember that Decision Trees have both advantages and limitations, and 
the choice of the appropriate algorithm depends on the speciﬁc problem and the 
characteristics of the data. 
Regenerate response shown in Fig. 3. In order to build a tree, this paper used the 
CART algorithm. A decision tree simply asks a question, and based on the answer 
(Yes/No), it further split the tree into subtrees [6].
Results: 
Each time this method iterates, the output results are dependent on the characteristics’ 
entropy (H) and information gain (IG). To the extent that the halting requirements 
are not met, the splitting process produces fully formed trees. In order to overcome 
the attribute selection issue, the Gini index, Gain ratio, Reduction in variance, and

Chi-square will be calculated here. This method keeps iterating over each subset 
while only taking into account traits that have never been chosen previously. As can 
be seen in Figs. 4 and 5, the pruned model is therefore simpler, more comprehensible, 
and easier to grasp than the random forest model.
Limitations: 
a. The process of choosing a tree is complicated since it has several tiers. 
b. 
It might have a problem with excessive overﬁtting. 
c. When relative to other methods, less information processing is necessary.

Classiﬁcation of Data Using Support Vector 
Machines-Machine Learning 
Support Vector Machines are categorized into more specialized computer science 
subﬁelds, and text mining may transform a shape into an organized form using 
homogenous data [7, 8]. Support Vector Machine (SVM), one of the supervised 
machine learning techniques, is used in the above classiﬁcation in order to speed up 
the entire procedure compared to the human approach [9]. In order to model abstract 
words with SVM, the TF-IDF approach is utilized to turn them into vectors. The 
10-fold cross validation method will be used with the classiﬁcation model. Based 
on these categorizations the matrix of confusion computation and the application of

three SVM kernels will be used to determine the performance that will result [10]. 
Based on the ﬁndings of this study, it can be concluded that there are two variables that 
inﬂuence categorization precision: the quantity of participants in scientiﬁc classes 
that are unbalanced and the quantity of characteristics derived through the use of text 
mining [11]. The SVM Linear Kernel and 205 characteristics were used to achieve 
the highest degree of precision of examination, yielding a value of 58.3% (Fig. 6).
Results: 
As illustrated in Fig. 7, the resulting outcomes are generated by using the hyper plane 
in an N-dimensional space known as Euclidean, which is a ﬂat, the subset dimension is 
N−1of that space and separates it into two unconnected routes. Thus, by introducing

a new dimension to make the data linearly distinct and then applying algebraic 
manipulations to handle linear and non-linear issues, this paper may categorize the 
data by reﬂecting the boundary of decision back to the initial measurements.

Limitations: 
1. It is hard to choose an appropriate Kernel form: For handling the non-linear 
information, it is tricky to choose the optimum Kernel functions. It could be 
difﬁcult and complicated. You run the danger of creating too many vectors of 
support when using a big size kernel, which signiﬁcantly slows down training. 
2. The SVM method requires a signiﬁcant amount of memory. You need a lot of 
storage since you have to retain all the support vectors in memory and because 
the size of the training dataset pushes this amount up fast. 
3. Requires Feature Sizing: Feature scaling of the variables is necessary beforehand 
to employing SVM. 
4. SVM training on big data sets takes quite a while. 
5. Difﬁcult to comprehend: SVM model used is challenging.

Classiﬁcation Using Logistic Regression 
Algorithm-Machine Learning 
One of the ﬁrst and most used Machine Learning computations, logistic regression 
(LR) belongs to the category of supervised training [12]. Using a predetermined set 
of independent variables, it is used to forecast a related categorized variable. As 
seen in Fig. 8, a model of logistic regression predicts the results of a variable with 
a category that is dependent. The outcome must thus be a discrete or classiﬁcation 
value. The exact value might be stated as 0 or 1, but it could also be described as 
either Yes or No, 0 or 1, True or False, etc. It gives probabilities in the range of 0 to 
1 values. It is quite similar to the application of linear regression, with the possible 
exception of how they are employed [13]. For classiﬁcation problems, a Logistic 
Approach to Regression is employed; for regression problems, a linear-regression 
technique is employed [14].

threshold value test set result

Fig. 9 Prediction results of linear and logistic prediction 
Results: 
Here the output results can be obtained by using confusion matrix and ROC curves, 
maximum likelihood and sigmoid function. For logistic regression outcomes are 
target variables are dichotomous in nature. In order to forecast the output, this method 
of statistics for predicting binary classes computes the likelihood of an occurrence. In 
contrast, the goal variable in linear regression is a qualitative one. Therefore, logistic 
regression produces an unchanged result as illustrated in Fig 9 and employs a log of 
chances as the variable that is dependent. 
Limitations: 
1. In real life, data is rarely linearly separable, hence the presumption of linearity 
between the dependent and independent variables is a major drawback of 
the logistic regression method. The majority of the time, information will 
appear disorganized. 
2. Regression using logistic regression should not be employed if there are less data 
than features, since this might result in overﬁtting. 
3. Discrete functions can only be predicted using logistic regression methods. 
Logistic regression can only use the discrete number set as the dependent vari-
able. Due to the excessively constant information, this constraint in and of itself 
is difﬁcult. 
4. Logistic regression models can be outperformed by more advanced algorithms 
like artiﬁcial neural networks and randomly generated forests. 
5. The technique for logistic regression is dependent on exceptions.

Data Classiﬁcation Using KNN Algorithm-Machine 
Learning 
K-Nearest Neighbours represents one of the simplest supervised learning-based 
autonomous training algorithms. The KNN approach assigns new data to the cate-
gory that is most similar to existing categories under the presumption that new data 
and current events are related. The procedure known as KNN categorizes new data 
points based on similarity and records all readily available information [15]. This 
suggests that when new data is produced, it may be swiftly and precisely categorized 
using the technique known as KNN. As shown in Fig. 10, the KNN approach may 
be applied to classiﬁcation and regression problems, however it is more typically 
employed for issues related to classiﬁcation. KNN is a non-parametric in method, 
which means it doesn’t make any presumptions about the data it uses [16]. Since it 
stores a dataset instead of immediately learning from the training set, it is also known 
as a lazy learner algorithm [17, 18]. Instead, it groups recent data into a category that 
closely resembles the recent information. 
Results: 
The degree of similarity among the fresh data points and the previously stored data 
points is used to determine the output results. Parameter tuning, which is required 
for improved outcomes, is the process of selecting the appropriate value of K [19]. 
By computing the Euclidean distance between the newly inserted data point and its 
closest neighbours, the outcome may be predicted. Our goal is to ﬁnd the shortest 
Euclidean distance, and the base of estimation depends on how many lesser distances 
are there [20].

Limitations 
1. It is constantly necessary to ﬁnd the value of K, which may be at times difﬁcult. 
2. Because the procedure must establish the distance among every information point 
in every instance of training, it is expensive. 
Conclusion: 
The Random Forest Algorithm, Tree Classiﬁer based on Decision, Regression based 
on Logistics, Support Vector Machines, and KNN algorithm are only a few of the 
approaches for data categorization based on ML techniques that are described in this 
Paper. We classiﬁed the provided data using several methods, and by selecting various 
techniques, we will obtain various outcomes. While Naive’s Bayes is a classiﬁcation 
technique for situations involving binary and many classes. When this method is 
explained using binary or categorical input values, it is easier to grasp. The main-
stream of requests for this Naive Bayes method including analysis of sentiment, 
ﬁltering spam and the systems recommendations, etc. This is simple and fast to put 
into practice, but the predictors’ dependence in most real-world scenarios makes the 
classiﬁer less effective.

Introduction 
Next-generation transportation trends that involve self-driving cars and ride sharing 
need the use of various vehicular networking systems [1]. In contrast, intelligent 
modes of transportation (ITS) that are connected with vehicular communications aim 
to reduce congestion in trafﬁc, crashes, air pollution, consumption of energy, and time 
waste [2]. Up-to-date vehicle communications are intended to enable timely and efﬁ-
cient delivery of information regarding accidents, congestion in trafﬁc, and roadway 
conditions that drivers do not comprehend [3]. Furthermore, OFDM with QAM is 
highly suited for broadband applications due to its capacity to handle frequency-
selective channels [4]. QAM offers resistance to fading and interference on each 
subcarrier, while OFDM allows each subcarrier to experience a variety of channel 
conditions separately [5]. As a result, OFDM with QAM is suitable for systems like 
wireless communication, digital television, and broadband internet access [6]. 
In broadband applications, combining OFDM with QAM offers a strong method 
for delivering high data rates, efﬁcient spectrum utilisation, and dependable transmis-
sion in challenging channel conditions [7, 8]. It has developed into the foundation of 
modern broadband communication networks, offering seamless connectivity, high-
speed internet access, and delivery of multimedia content in a variety of contexts.

[9]. VLC systems provide substantial beneﬁts over conventional systems [10] in  
following areas. 
1. High Bandspectrum. 
2. More secure and easy to implement. 
3. Highly immune to interference with electromagneticsignals. 
4. Robust againstRoping. 
These essential qualities of the VLC system enable it to be employed in high-ﬁdelity 
systems that support the web and the IOT-Internet of Things, and also in medical 
health-care systems to provide data service as well as tracking in areas when radio 
frequency has constraints [11, 12]. With the use of trafﬁc light infrastructure, VLC 
may also be employed in car devices for lane shift warning, trafﬁc sign motion 
assistant, pre-crash detection, and other purposes [13].

Literature Review 
Since the data that is broadcast is comparable on a number of different rates, the bit 
sequence time is signiﬁcantly longer compared to a sequential system having the same 
total data rate. Because a symbol’s time is longer, ISI only affects one symbol, making 
equalisation easier. Any residual ISI in maximal OFDM operations is indifferent, 
spending a cyclic preﬁx, resulting in a sort of guard interval [14]. When Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (FDM) is used in unadventurous wireless networks or Wave-
length Division Multiplexing (WDM) is used in photosensitive schemes, data is deliv-
ered on a number of separate regularities concurrently. However, there are some key 
conceptual and real-world contrasts between OFDM and these classical systems. The 
subchannel frequency were chosen across one OFDM symbols period such that the 
indications are scientiﬁcally false. The required orthogonal signs may be generated 
precisely and mathematically efﬁciently by using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform 
(IFFT) for both modulation and multiplexing. In FDM or WDM, frequency differ-
ence bands are located around the subcarriers. Individual subchannels are recovered 
at the receiver using analogue ﬁltering methods. Since the area of each OFDM 
subcarrier takes on a form, each OFDM subchannel contains enormous side portions 
throughout a frequency range that includes numerous other subchannels. One of the 
primary disadvantages of OFDM is its susceptibility to frequency imbalance and 
phase clatter [15]. By successfully tackling the issues of multi-path fading, inter-
symbol interference, and frequency-selective fading, Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM), a modulation technology, has revolutionised communication 
networks. Due to its special qualities and advantages, OFDM, which was ﬁrst created 
for wireless applications, has also showed promise in optical display systems. In this 
review, we will discuss the fundamentals of OFDM that are important for optical 
display systems and dispel several myths that have previously circulated among

OFDM researchers. These subcarriers together cover the full available bandwidth, 
with each subcarrier often being narrowband and occupying a certain frequency 
range. For applications that have high bandwidth needs, such optical displays, this 
parallel data transfer provides high data rates and effective utilisation of the available 
spectrum. The subcarriers’ orthogonality is a crucial aspect of OFDM. Even when 
they are close together, it makes sure that the subcarriers don’t interfere with one 
another. The subcarriers’ frequencies and phases are carefully designed in order to 
achieve this orthogonality. As a result, the subcarriers may be quickly and individu-
ally demodulated and decoded, increasing the transmission’s resilience and depend-
ability. The ability of OFDM to split the accessible frequency spectrum into several 
orthogonal subcarriers is one of its key features. Constructed on real vehicle To 
Vehicle (V2V) transmission data, the normalized Channel Frequency Response for 
the V2LC network established to be invariable of inter-vehicle distance, TX/RX 
ambient light and also zenith angle. This medium characteristic is then employed in 
the BCE to approximate only the normalization factor, not the CSI, with all subcar-
riers independently. The projected method outclasses pilot-based CE methods on 
the basis of throughput performance and the bit error rate (BER) for any and all 
modulation techniques, with the exception of the 64-QAM DCO- OFDM, that is 
not practical because there is no suitable estimator, according to widespread simu-
lations at dissimilar speeds of vehicle. Additionally, Simulation of Urban Mobility’s 
realistic vehicle mobility scenario shows that the performance in real-time of the 
suggested BCE is very close to each modulation scheme’s maximum throughput at 
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (SUMO). 
Advantages:
• High speed communication
• Accurate Channel Estimation (CE)
• Elimination of Pilot overhead 
Limitations:
• Low Spectrum Efﬁciency
• Low SNR
• Improved Bit Error Rate (BER)

style pilot setup, different strategies for jointly estimating medium at pilots frequen-
cies and integrating the medium are examined. At pilot frequencies, LS and LMS 
are employed to estimate the medium. Time Domain Interpolation is obtained by 
moving to a time domains by IDFT, minimal wadding, and then recovering to the 
frequency domain using DFT. Furthermore, medium estimation according to block 
kind pilot prearrangement is performed by transmitting pilots to every sub-channel 
and depending on this evaluation for a certain number of following codes. As illus-
trated in Fig. 1, we also built conclusion feedback equalisation for all sub-channels 
using intervallic block-type pilots.

Proposed Methodology 
With pilot spacing units 1, 2, and 3, the suggested blind CE is compared to comb as 
well as block type CE. You may alter the relationship between the vehicle speed as 
well as constellation size before executing the code. It displays the average throughput 
for every subcarrier as well as the BER in proportion to the SNR. When extensive DC 
biassing is used, the optical energy for each bit in relation to one side noise power 
spectral density, Ebopt/No, rises considerably, rendering the technique useless or 
unproductive. As a result, for one to preserve a low BER, DC bias has to be kept 
to a minimum; yet, since DC bias is signiﬁcant, as mentioned above, an accept-
able value of DC biassing is proposed. Effective communication between autos and 
trafﬁc infrastructure (such as trafﬁc signs, trafﬁc lights, and so on) is crucial for 
guaranteeing the security of the trafﬁc system. VLC is an exciting technology which 
might be the right solution to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure 
(V2I) data transmission concerns. A signiﬁcant issue in this respect is the construc-
tion of an appropriate sensor to decrease the inﬂuence of natural light during the day. 
Establishing good communication between cars and the transportation infrastructure,

which includes components like trafﬁc signs, stoplights, and other roadside equip-
ment, is essential to attaining this aim. Visible Light Communication (VLC) stands 
out as an exciting technology in this context that has the ability to overcome issues 
with data transfer between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure 
(V2I). 
Information is transmitted with VLC using visible light, more especially the region 
of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Utilising current 
lighting infrastructure, such as LED lights, this technique modulates light signals’ 
intensities to communicate data. VLC allows for communication between cars and 
nearby infrastructure elements, resulting in the formation of a coherent and integrated 
network that improves overall safety. 
The generated signal is modulated by a light source and then transmitted through 
the WOC channel. After the DC bias is completely eliminated, the opposite operation 
is carried out at the receiver. Impulse reaction of the medium is squatter than Cyclic 
Preﬁx (CP). Deliberate fading properties of the channel is time-invariant compare 
to the symbol interval. Quadrilateral Windowing of the transmitted pulses Perfect 
Synchronization of transmitter and receiver additive noise, white noise, Gaussian 
channel noise. Furthermore, such ﬁndings would provide insight into how to select 
appropriate parameters for actual DCO-OFDM systems in order to improve the SE 
tradeoff. Finally, using a LOS link, it is shown that the stream of light approach 
perspective has a considerable inﬂuence on ophthalmic power circulation in the 
acceptance level as shown in Fig. 2. The VLC-OFDM signal, on the additional side, 
still has a maximum PAPR, and future research will focus on correcting this issue.

The graph in Fig. 3 depicts the Spectral Efﬁciency vs. Ambient Light for a 16-
bit MQAM-OFDM communication system. This graph depicts how the system’s 
spectral efﬁciency varies depending on the ambient light conditions. The amount of 
information that can be transmitted per unit of bandwidth is referred to as spectral 
efﬁciency. According to the results in Fig. 3, the spectral efﬁciency is superior and 
optimal across the various ambient light conditions considered in Table 1.
Table 1 provides a detailed comparison of spectral efﬁciency against various 
ambient light conditions. It includes scenarios such as a parking lot, lights off at 
night, lights on at night, partially cloudy but sunrise, sunny conditions, partially 
cloudy conditions, sunset, cloudy sunset, and shadowed environments. The table 
clearly shows that spectral efﬁciency remains consistently high and optimal despite 
the varying ambient light conditions. This demonstrates that the 16-bit MQAM-
OFDM system is robust and capable of maintaining performance regardless of the 
lighting conditions. 
Moving on, Fig. 4 depicts the Spectral Efﬁciency versus Zenith Angle for a 16-bit 
MQAM-OFDM system at a distance of 10 m in a parking structure. The zenith angle 
is the angle formed by the vertical direction and the line that connects the observer to 
the sun. The graph depicts how the spectral efﬁciency varies with zenith angle. The 
results show that the spectral efﬁciency remains superior and optimal across a wide

maintain its performance under changing solar positions.
Table 2 compares the spectral efﬁciency of the 16-bit MQAM-OFDM system in 
a parking structure at 10 m to different zenith angles. The table shows that spectral 
efﬁciency is consistently high and optimal across a wide range of zenith angles. This 
implies that the system can maintain its performance regardless of solar position or 
angle of incidence.
In conclusion, both the spectral efﬁciency against ambient light conditions and 
the spectral efﬁciency against zenith angles show that the 16-bit MQAM-OFDM 
system performs superior and optimally. These ﬁndings demonstrate the system’s 
robustness and reliability under various lighting and solar conditions, highlighting 
its suitability for a variety of practical applications.

Conclusion 
The performance of VLC’s DCOOFDM schemes is evaluated in this research paper. 
The BER performance is reviewed as well as some issues of VLC design in practise. 
The simulation ﬁndings show that as similar with the DC biasing value grows, the 
BitErrorRate at the VLC scheme increases. When a strong DC biasing voltage is 
employed, the energy in optical medium per bit to Single Sided Noise Power Spec-
tral Density, Ebopt/Number, increases dramatically, rendering the method inefﬁcient 
or unproductive in terms of optical inﬂuence. In mandate to maintain a lower BitEr-
rorRate, DC biasing mechanism essential be minimal; Although the existence of DC

bias can signiﬁcantly affect a system, using a reasonable degree of DC bias is advised. 
The investigation of the impacts of SE-Ambient Light and SE-Zenith angle in a DCO-
OFDM (Direct Current Offset Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system 
was the main goal of the research described in the previous sentence. The study’s 
results included an increase in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and a decrease in the 
Bit Error Rate (BER), which eventually resulted in an improvement in the system’s 
average throughput.

Introduction 
MLIs are designed to provide industries with high-quality outputs and reduced 
ripples. Two-level inverters have suffered from several disadvantages, including high 
losses in the number of switches and greater power rating requirements. Typically, 
series combinations of switches are used to meet high voltage requirements, while 
parallel combinations are used for high current applications. However, this approach 
results in at least sixty percent Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), leading to increased 
power losses and decreased power quality output. High-current-carrying switches 
cause more power loss and temperature increase, leading to permanent damage. 
MLIs generate multiple voltage steps at the output with minimal harmonics, making 
them popular in recent times. 
MLIs ﬁnd applications in high-voltage and high-power requirements. There are 
three main types of MLIs: (i) DC-MLIs, (ii) FC-MLIs, and (iii) CHB-MLIs. In 
addition to these classical MLIs, new topologies are available, such as modular MLIs 
and hybrid MLIs. Each type of MLI has its drawbacks. A 15-level non-insulated 
DC sources for novel symmetrical MLI with reduced switches has been developed 
to require fewer gate driver circuits and reduce complexity. A different topology

for sub MLIs, serially connected, is proposed as a generalized MLI. The proposed 
MLI reduces switching devices in symmetric and asymmetric topologies. Various 
DC-link voltages are explained for asymmetric topologies, speciﬁcally the trinary 
providing a waveform with 3n levels, where n is the cells connected in cascaded, 
resulting in low THD and reduced dv/dt. A single-phase CHMLI is developed with 
a proposed basic unit in series with the H-bridge. Various algorithms are proposed 
to decrease the inverter’s cost by using fewer DC voltage sources, power switches, 
and installation space. An asymmetrical hybridized cascaded MLI is implemented 
for comparison with a symmetrical version, resulting in increased output voltage and 
double output load voltage for the asymmetric MLI DC sources. Simpliﬁed MLIs in 
symmetrical and asymmetrical forms are compared by calculating conduction losses 
and veriﬁed efﬁciency at various carrier frequencies. An asymmetrical type MLI has 
been validated based on Fuzzy, ANN and Indirect Field Oriented Control techniques. 
A hybrid MLI with an assisted boost network is proposed. Level shifted and phase-
shifted PWM methods are evaluated for a 7-level inverter. The multicarrier PWM 
technique is implemented for a diodeless neutral clamped MLI. 
To achieve the desired amplitude voltage and frequency, the controlling technique 
is a crucial factor. Harmonics at low frequencies in VSIs produce power losses 
and pulsating torque in AC drives. Asymmetrical type MLIs with 31 levels and 
symmetrical 13 levels are implemented using a novel modulation method. Symmetric 
and asymmetric comparisons are made for low THD and with an asynchronous motor 
drive. The MC-LSSPWM control approach is used to provide an ideal organized 
31-level MLI with the least number of switches and DC sources to improve the 
effectiveness of AC motor drives. By increasing the number of levels, the suggested 
MLI generates extremely low switching losses, minimal off-state voltage dips, and 
lowest THD owing to the sinusoidal discharge waveform.

Proposed Sub Multilevel Inverter Topology 
The suggested sub MLI has ‘n’ number of DC sources, as indicated in Fig. 1. 
Normally, the number of DC sources is uneven. Each DC source must be equal 
to Vdc to produce equivalent voltage steps. Each sub MLI has n+2 switches, some 
unidirectional and others bidirectional. Unidirectional switches are IGBTs with an 
opposing shunt diode. Switches S1, S’1, S(n+2)/2, and S’(n+2)/2 are unidirectional, 
while the remaining are bidirectional and endure positive and negative voltages. To 
achieve Vo = Vdc, switches S(n+2)/2 and Sn/2 are switched ON, and Vo=–Vdc is 
obtained with the ON condition of switches S(n−2)/2 and Sn/2. The same procedure 
is applied to the other switches. Bidirectional switches with two IGBTs and a single 
gate driver circuit generate positive and negative voltages. This sub multilevel struc-
ture provides positive or zero levels of output voltage. When switches S1 and S1 are 
both turned on, the output is zero.

Fig. 1 Proposed sub MLI 
The state of the switches for each output voltage is given in Table 1, where the 
value ‘1’ indicates the ON state, and ’0’ represents the OFF state of a switch. From 
Fig. 2, if two switches are required to be turned ON for every output voltage stage, 
the procedure is as follows: ﬁrst, select a switch from the upper layer, and then select 
the second one from the lower portion. To obtain an output voltage of (n−1) * Vdc, 
the switches Sn/2 and S’(n+2)/2 should be switched ON, as shown in Table 1.

Proposed Generalized Cascaded Multilevel Inverter 
Topology 
The cascaded MLI suggested here is a series of sub multilevel inverters for attaining 
the needed voltage levels. ‘m’ is the total amount of sub MLIs in sequence in Fig. 2. 
Each sub MLI is made up of a ‘n’ number of DC voltage sources that are the same for 
every single sub MLI, whether symmetrical or asymmetrical. The sub MLI produces 
only positive and zero output voltage levels; to create negative levels, an H-bridge 
inverters is attached across the entire string of sub MLIs. Positive output voltages are 
acquired while the ON state of ‘T1’ and ‘T4’ devices, while negative output voltages 
are obtained during the ON position of ‘T2’ and ‘T3’ devices in the H-bridge.

Modulation Method 
In this modulation technique, all triangular carriers are operated with equal frequency 
and magnitude with level shift. The number of carriers depends on the number of 
voltage levels, with the peak magnitude being the summation of all carrier wave 
magnitudes. The below Fig. 5 shows the modulation method for the 7-level proposed 
MLI, in which three high-frequency triangular carrier waves above zero are at levels 
of 100, 200, 300 V, and below zero at levels of −100, −200, −300 V, distributed along 
with a low-frequency sinusoidal reference wave. The ﬁring pulses will be generated 
where the carrier wave magnitude is more than the reference wave.

Symmetrical 13 Level Proposed Generalized Cascaded 
MLI 
The symmetrical cascaded MLI shown in Fig. 6 consists of all equal DC sources. In 
this MLI, two sub MLIs are implemented, each with three sources and ﬁve switches 
(IGBTs with anti-parallel diodes). An H-bridge with four switches is connected 
across the series of two sub MLIs. The type of load is RL with R = 100 Ω and L 
= 100 mH, with a total DC input of 300 V. Table 4 shows the ON state switching 
pattern for the single-phase 13-level MLI. To get an output voltage of +300 V (level 
1), the ON state switches are S31, T1, T4, S’22, S32, and S’21. To get an output voltage 
of -300 V (level 13), the ON state switches are S31, T2, T3, S’22, S32, and S’21. The  
MC-LSSPWM is implemented with a sine wave as reference, and above zero, six 
triangular carrier waves and below zero, six carrier triangular waves are used for 
pulse generation to turn switches on.

Proposed Asymmetrical 31 Level Generalized Cascaded 
MLI 
The asymmetric cascaded MLI, DC voltage sources’ values differ from one sub MLI 
to other. In any one sub MLI, the DC sources are same but for another sub MLI 
another DC sources exist so that maximum levels in output is obtained, there by 
smooth wave form is achieved. 
In above n-DC sources number, m-sub MLIs number, Fig. 7 shows the proposed 31

related switches. In this MLI, RL load used with values as R = 100 Ω and L = 100 
mH, with total DC input of 300 V.
In the proposed 31 level MLI, switches operated with MC-LSSPWM technique 
to obtain required levels at output. In this technique low frequency reference wave is 
sinusoidal waveform and high frequency carrier waves are triangular wave forms. In 
this 31 MLI, for positive half cycle of reference wave 15 number of carrier waves and 
for negative half cycle of reference wave 15 number of carrier waves are implemented 
at different positive negative magnitude levels respectively. Table 5 shows different 
voltage levels where carrier signals are distributed. Therefore above zero 15 positive 
levels, below zero 15 negative levels and zero level therefore 31 levels achieved.

Conventional Single Phase 31 Level Cascaded MLI 
The existing conventional single phase 31 level cascaded MLI topology shown in 
Fig. 8, in which four H-bridges are coupled in series through one DC source and 
4 switches ineach H-bridge unit. Table 6 shows switching patterns with sources 
for obtaining voltage levels. Suppose if (20 + 40 + 80 + 160) volts voltage sources 
used, then +300 V achieved. Similarly for −300 V obtaining case, (–20–40-80–160) 
voltage sources need to operate. For example, if +20 voltage sources used means, 
the switches S12, S13 should be turned ON and for −20 voltage source used case S11,

S14 switches should be ON i.e., one from upper layer andanother from lower layer 
with opposite limbs. If anyone voltage source voltage not included case both the 
switches should be ON from upper layer and lower layer of same leg for gettingshort 
circuit. For example to obtain +100 V output, switches S32 S44 S42 S13 S12 S24 S22 
S33 should be turned ON. For −100 V output case, required ON switches are S31 
S43 S41 S14 S11 S23 S21 S34. To obtain +300 V the ON state switches are S42 S13 S12 
S23 S22 S33 S32 S43. For  −300 V output purpose the ON state switches are S41 S14 
S11 S24 S21 S34 S31 S44.In similar way, the remaining switches have been conducting 
sate for required voltage levels.

Simulation Results and Analysis 
In the proposed Multi-Level Inverter (MLI) conﬁguration, the approach involves the 
initial design of a sub MLI, followed by a series connection of all sub MLIs to create 
a generalized cascaded MLI. This structure is employed to compare and analyze 
the performance of various MLIs. The ﬁrst comparison is made with a Seven-Level 
Symmetrical MLI, utilizing 10 switches. The corresponding voltage waveform is 
depicted in Fig. 11, demonstrating a THD of 34.60% (as shown in Fig. 12) and a 
fundamental voltage of 220.7 V. Additionally, the current waveform is presented 
(Fig. 13), revealing a THD of 30.15% (Fig. 14) and a fundamental current of 2.80 A. 
Contrasting this, an Existing Seven-Level Cascaded H-Bridge MLI is examined, 
requiring 12 switches. The voltage waveform is shown in Fig. 15, featuring a THD of 
42.08% (as depicted in Fig. 16) and a fundamental voltage of 210.9 V. The associated 
current waveform is displayed (Fig. 17), indicating a THD of 32.16% (Fig. 18) and 
a fundamental current of 2.135 A.
Further analysis includes a Cascaded 13-Level Symmetrical MLI, utilizing 14 
switches and 6 DC sources. The output voltage waveform (Fig. 19) showcases a 
THD of 7.54% (Fig. 20) with a fundamental voltage of 298.2 V. Simultaneously, the

Notably, the Proposed Optimal Structured Cascaded 31-Level MLI requires 12 
switches and 4 DC sources. The corresponding output voltage waveform (Fig. 23) 
displays a THD of 2.94% (Fig. 24), coupled with a fundamental voltage of 299.50 V. 
The output current waveform (Fig. 25) exhibits a THD of 1.12% (Fig. 26), along 
with a fundamental current of 2.914 amps.

Transitioning to the interaction with a three-phase Induction Motor (IM), the 
three-phase cascaded MLI is examined in the drive performance context. The three-
phase output voltage waveform of the 31-level MLI is visualized in Fig. 27, while the 
sinusoidal three-phase stator current waveforms (Fig. 28) are a result of increased 
waveform levels, leading to improved quality and harmonic suppression.
The proposed optimal structured cascaded 31-level MLI-fed IM drive showcases 
consistent speed maintenance near the reference speed, superior torque in maximum 
and starting scenarios, and reduced rise and settling times (Fig. 28). Furthermore, 
when scrutinized under no-load and 5 Nm load conditions, the three-phase output

a THD of 5.06% and a fundamental current of 2.851 A under the load condition. This 
enhanced performance of the induction motor through the utilization of the 31-level 
MLI is encapsulated in Table 9, which summarizes the three-phase 31-level MLI-fed 
IM drive’s performance under steady-state conditions (Figs. 29 and 30).

As indicated in the preceding Table 7, it is evident that the proposed 7-level 
MLI exhibits several advantages, including a reduction in Total Harmonic Distortion 
(THD) and a decreased number of switches, all while achieving improved funda-
mental voltage and current characteristics at the same voltage level and number of 
voltage sources. In pursuit of even more enhanced attributes while minimizing the 
required DC sources, a symmetric 13-level and an asymmetric 31-level MLI were 
introduced. Notably, these conﬁgurations signiﬁcantly lower the THD, as illustrated 
in the subsequent Table 8.
In the above levels of MLIs the load is considered as RL. The single phase 31 level 
MLI has been intended as 3 phase 31 level MLI for verifying dynamic performance 
as shown in Table 9.

Conclusion 
Initially, a single-phase symmetrical 7-level MLI is proposed with reduced switches 
and THD in comparison with the existing 7-level H-bridge MLI with the same DC 
sources. A single-phase 13-level symmetrical-type MLI is intended, and its output 
voltage, current waveforms, and THD are veriﬁed. Later, a single-phase asymmet-
rical 31-level MLI with an optimal structure has been built, and its voltage, current 
waveforms, and THD are veriﬁed. The proposed asymmetrical cascaded 31-level 
MLI has given minimum THD with reduced switches and DC sources than the 13-
level symmetrical MLI. We observed that the quality in voltage and current output 
increases with voltage level. The harmonics in the output current and voltage are 
suppressed with an increase in level. 
The proposed three-phase cascaded 31-level MLI is implemented with a star 
connection of three individual single-phase 31-level MLIs, and its output voltage, 
current waveforms, and THD are veriﬁed. Later, the three-phase 31-level MLI is 
fed with a three-phase IM, considering both without and with load conditions. In

the proposed MLI-fed asynchronous motor drive, speed, torque, and stator currents 
are veriﬁed, demonstrating good performance. Hence, by observing the results, the 
harmonic content has been mostly minimized, and the performance of the drive is 
enhanced.

Introduction 
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is well recognised for its importance in a 
variety of applications, which has inspired academics to delve into its fundamentals 
and create a slew of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms [1]. The DFT is a 
fundamental mathematical technique that allows for the study and manipulation of 
frequency-domain signals. Its applications include signal processing, communica-
tions, image processing, audio processing, and others. The use of FFT and inverse 
FFT (IFFT) algorithms facilitates the computation of the DFT and its inverse [2]. 
Consider the following sequence of complex numbers: × 0… xN. 
The Cooley-Tukey approach stands out as the most extensively used FFT algo-
rithm due to its consistent performance and simplicity [3]. These properties are 
extremely desirable when creating efﬁcient FFT algorithm hardware and soft-
ware implementations [4]. Notably, when compared to the Radix-2 FFT technique, 
the Radix-4 and Radix-8 FFT algorithms built from the Cooley-Tukey method 
show signiﬁcant reductions in computational cost [5]. However, achieving addi-
tional reductions in computing complexity has been increasingly difﬁcult, pushing 
academics to focus on twiddle factor evaluation improvements [6]. 
FFT algorithm improvements are critical in the creation of high-speed, low-power 
FFT processors used in wireless communications, radar systems, and other areas [7]. 
We built an effective Radix-4 method in our project by making modest changes to 
the traditional technique. These changes, which attempted to reduce the amount of 
twiddle factor assessments, resulted in reduced complexity and faster processing

time. To accomplish this, we reindexed the output samples produced from the DFT 
decomposition [8]. 
Higher radix approaches, such as Radix-4 and Radix-8, can reduce difﬁcult calcu-
lations, but also add complexity to the butterﬂy structure due to the presence of several 
input complex adders [9, 10]. Recent research has concentrated on the creation of 
multi-path pipelined FFT algorithms in order to improve their performance and 
efﬁciency. These endeavours seek to investigate novel approaches for improving 
performance characteristics in FFT implementations. 
Many architectures of Fast Fourier Transform processor are introduced to use in 
OFDM transmission, such as the Multipath Delay Feedback, single-path delay feed-
back, multipath delay commutator, Single Path Delay Commutator. Various architec-
tures of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processors have been introduced in the context 
of OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) transmission. These archi-
tectures try to conduct the FFT computations required in OFDM-based systems as 
efﬁciently as possible. 
The Multipath Delay Feedback architecture is one such example. This architec-
ture includes various delay elements and feedback pathways that aid in concurrent 
and pipelined data processing. The usage of multiple routes allows for the parallel 
processing of several FFT blocks, increasing the FFT processor’s overall throughput. 
Another architecture is Single-Path Delay Feedback, which simpliﬁes the design by 
employing only one delay element and feedback path. Although this architecture has 
a lesser throughput than the multipath variant, it is more efﬁcient in executing FFT 
computations. Similarly, the Multipath Delay Commutator architecture is intended 
to process many FFT blocks at the same time. It uses a commutation mechanism to 
efﬁciently swap and transport data between several FFT processing units, enabling 
parallel processing and increasing the FFT processor’s throughput. 
The Single-Path Delay Commutator architecture, on the other hand, combines 
the beneﬁts of a streamlined design (with a single delay element) with the commu-
tation technique’s efﬁcient data routing capabilities. This architecture achieves a 
good mix of complexity and performance, making it appropriate for several OFDM 
applications.These various FFT processor architectures offer trade-offs in terms of 
complexity, throughput, and resource utilisation. The architecture chosen is deter-
mined by speciﬁc application needs like as processing speed, available resources, 
and power limits.The MDF design is widely utilized as an answer to give a capacity 
rate of more than one GS/s among the many Fast Fourier Transform architectures. 
Many algorithms of FFT and dynamic scaling strategies are presented to lower the 
space and power consumption as shown in Table 1.
This study addresses the need for effective and fast algorithms for performing the 
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). While the DFT is a fundamental mathematical 
procedure with many uses in signal processing, communications, image processing, 
and audio processing, existing algorithms may fall short of meeting the demands 
of real-time processing, resource-constrained systems, and demanding applications 
such as wireless communications and radar systems. Fast algorithms that can greatly 
reduce the computing time and complexity of the DFT while retaining accuracy and 
keeping the desired signal characteristics are in high demand. The goal of this project

General Radix-4 Algorithm 
To increase the fastness of the operation Radix-4 algorithm is investigated. This can 
be achieved by changing the base to 4. If the base is increased for the same number, 
the power/index will drop. Since N = 43 (N = 4M), the number of steps for Radix-4 
has been cut by 50%, resulting in only three stages. Radix-4 is a four-input, four-
output system that uses an in-place algorithm. Every fourth-time sample, recursively 
the Radix-4 DIT-Fast Fourier Transform splits the DFT into four DFTs of the fourth 
length. The results of these shorter Fast Fourier Transforms are reused to compute 
a large number of outputs, lowering the total computational cost signiﬁcantly. The 
Radix-4 algorithm is a method for increasing the efﬁciency and speed of Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) operations. It accomplishes this by modifying the algorithm’s base 
to 4, which allows for faster computing than the usual Radix-2 approach. The Radix-
4 algorithm has the advantage of reducing the amount of calculation steps necessary. 
When compared to the Radix-2 technique, the Radix-4 approach can cut the number 
of steps in half with a sequence length N = 43, which is a multiple of 4 (N = 4M). 
This step reduction results in only three stages being required for the Radix-4 FFT 
computation. 
The need for the Radix-4 algorithm in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations 
arises from the demand for faster and more efﬁcient computation techniques. The 
Radix-4 algorithm offers several advantages that address this need and contribute to 
its importance in various applications. 
1. Increased Speed: The Radix-4 algorithm improves the speed of FFT computations 
compared to traditional methods like the Radix-2 algorithm. By changing the 
base to 4, the algorithm reduces the number of computation steps, resulting in

faster processing times. This speed enhancement is particularly beneﬁcial in real-
time applications where rapid data processing is essential, such as in wireless 
communication systems, audio and video processing, and radar systems. 
2. Efﬁcient Resource Utilization: The Radix-4 algorithm utilizes an in-place compu-
tation approach, which means that it performs computations directly on the input 
data without requiring additional memory space. This efﬁcient resource utiliza-
tion reduces the need for additional storage and memory accesses, resulting in 
optimized hardware implementation and reduced overall computational cost. 
3. Computational Cost Reduction: The recursive nature of the Radix-4 algorithm 
allows for the reuse of intermediate results from shorter FFT computations. By 
reusing these results, the algorithm signiﬁcantly reduces redundant calculations, 
leading to a substantial reduction in the total computational cost. This cost reduc-
tion is particularly important in applications that involve large data sets or require 
high-frequency resolution, as it enables efﬁcient processing without sacriﬁcing 
accuracy. 
4. Scalability and Flexibility: The Radix-4 algorithm is scalable and can be applied 
to FFT computations of varying sizes. It can handle sequences of lengths that 
are multiples of 4 (N = 4M) efﬁciently, making it adaptable to different system 
requirements. This scalability and ﬂexibility are crucial in applications where the 
input data size may vary dynamically or where different FFT lengths are needed. 
5. Application Versatility: The improved speed and efﬁciency offered by the Radix-
4 algorithm make it suitable for a wide range of applications. It is commonly 
used in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems, which 
are widely used in wireless communication standards like Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G. 
The algorithm’s fastness and low computational complexity enable efﬁcient 
signal processing in these systems, leading to enhanced data transmission rates, 
improved spectral efﬁciency, and reliable communication. 
In conclusion, the Radix-4 algorithm addresses the need for faster and more 
efﬁcient FFT computations. Its speed enhancements, efﬁcient resource utiliza-
tion, computational cost reduction, scalability, and versatility make it important in 
various applications. By utilizing the advantages of the Radix-4 algorithm, systems 
can achieve accelerated signal processing, improved data transmission rates, and 
optimized resource utilization, ultimately leading to enhanced performance and 
efﬁciency in numerous ﬁelds. 
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a fundamental mathematical operation 
that is used to analyse and transform frequency-domain signals. It has numerous 
applications in disciplines like as signal processing, telecommunication, picture 
processing, audio processing, and others. The DFT computes the spectrum repre-
sentation of a discrete signal, exposing the frequencies and magnitudes present in 
the signal. As the demand for real-time signal processing grows, there is a need 
to develop more efﬁcient and faster DFT methods. Traditional DFT techniques, 
such as the direct method, are computationally complex, making them unsuitable 
for real-time processing or resource-constrained systems. As a result, academics

have concentrated on creating Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms that provide 
signiﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency. 
The Radix-4 algorithm uses an in-place algorithm with a four-input, four-output 
system. This means that the input data is changed in the same memory region as 
the output data, which reduces the requirement for additional storage. The algo-
rithm divides the DFT recursively into four smaller DFTs of one-fourth the length. 
These shorter FFTs are computed utilising the preceding stage’s data, resulting in a 
considerable reduction in total computational cost. The Radix-4 algorithm can efﬁ-
ciently compute a large number of outputs by reusing the results of the shorter FFT 
computations. This reuse of intermediate ﬁndings reduces superﬂuous calculations 
and increases the FFT process’s overall processing efﬁciency. To summarise, the 
Radix-4 technique speeds up FFT computations by increasing the base to 4. It uses 
an in-place approach to decrease the amount of computing steps and recursively 
separates the DFT into smaller FFTs. It successfully lowers the total computing cost 
by reusing intermediate ﬁndings. Because of these qualities, the Radix-4 technique is 
a good approach for accelerating FFT computations and boosting overall operation 
speed. Radix-4 Fast Fourier Transforms require just 75% as many complexes when 
compared to Radix-2 Fast Fourier Transform as shown in Fig. 1. 
By utilizing the results of minor, medium calculations to create large DFT 
frequency outputs, DIF-FFT and DIT-FFT for Radix-4 Fast Fourier Transform boost 
the speed of the calculation. N point input signals are decomposed in Radix-4 Fast 
Fourier Transform Algorithms. 
Every N/4 output is a sum of four input samples all multiplied by −1, j, or + 1,–j 
as shown in Fig. 2.
General Radix-4 Butterﬂy is an indispensable building block for Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) computations, as it is generated by the Radix-4 algorithm. It is 
required for complex multiplication and addition in the frequency domain. Let’s 
examine the General Radix-4 Butterﬂy in greater detail.

General Radix-4 Butterﬂy accepts four complex inputs denoted by the letters X0, 
X1, X2, and X3. It calculates these inputs and produces four complex outputs labelled 
Y0, Y1, Y2, and Y3. 
The General Radix-4 Twiddle Factor Butterﬂy has twiddle factors, which are 
represented by Wk, where k is the index of the butterﬂy operation within the FFT. 
Twiddle factors are complex numbers used to incorporate phase shifts and amplitude 
scaling in butterﬂy computations. These factors are precomputed and saved to reduce 
computational costs during the FFT. 
The General Radix-4 Butterﬂy involves multiple computational procedures. 
a. Multiply and Add: X1 is multiplied by the initial twiddle factor, Wk0, and the 
resulting product is added to X0. 
– Add the result of multiplying X3 by the second twiddle factor, Wk1, to X2. 
b. 
Butterﬂy Operations: Y0 results from the addition of X0 and X2. 
– Determine Y1 by taking the difference between X0 and X2. 
– Adding X1 and X3 results in Y2. 
– Determine Y3 by taking the difference between X1 and X3. 
Additional Scaling: If necessary, apply scaling factors to the output values to 
normalise them.

The Radix-4 FFT algorithm is intended to be reusable by the General Radix-4 
Butterﬂy due to its recursive nature. It is applied iteratively to various phases of 
the FFT, enabling the computation of larger DFT sizes in an efﬁcient manner. The 
outputs of one butterﬂy operation may be utilised as inputs for subsequent butterﬂy 
operations, thereby reducing the number of redundant computations. 
The General Radix-4 Butterﬂy is typically implemented in hardware implemen-
tations of the Radix-4 FFT using speciﬁc functional units such as multipliers, adders, 
and complex arithmetic units. These components allow the Radix-4 FFT method to 
perform multiple butterﬂy operations in parallel, thereby improving its computational 
efﬁcacy. 
In FFT computations, the General Radix-4 Butterﬂy has a number of beneﬁts: 
– Reduced computational complexity: The Radix-4 algorithm requires fewer 
computation steps than Radix-2 algorithms for the same DFT size, resulting in 
increased efﬁciency. 
– Increased parallelism: The butterﬂy operations can be parallelized, allowing FFT 
computations to be sped up by utilising hardware resources. 
Compatible with modern processors and digital signal processing (DSP) chips, 
the Radix-4 algorithm is particularly valuable for hardware implementations. 
In conclusion, the General Radix-4 Butterﬂy is an essential component of the 
Radix-4 FFT technique, allowing intricate multiplication and addition operations in 
the frequency domain to be performed quickly and efﬁciently. Recursion, reusability, 
and parallelism all contribute to the computational efﬁcacy and performance of the 
Radix-4 FFT.

Improved Radix-4 Algorithm 
With the exception of a minor modiﬁcation that has a substantial effect, Radix-4 
DIF Fast Fourier Transform technique is usually similar to that of the disintegration 
strategy, and the twiddle factor matrix is the result of this. To refer to the Radix-
4 DIF Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, the modiﬁed Radix-4 DIF Fast Fourier 
Transform method will be utilised and that results from revised decomposition. The 
updated algorithm’s processing requires just four actual twiddle factors (cosine and 
sine) to be assessed or imported from the lookup database, it is shown that at the 
time of operating of modiﬁed algorithm only four true twiddle factors must be either 
assessed or added. The usage of six real twiddle factors is required by the basic use 
of standard Radix-4 DIF Fast Fourier Transform approach. As a result, the improved 
method reduces twiddle factor evaluations and lookup database requests by 33%. It’s 
worth mentioning that index generation saves money in the same way that the lookup 
table does. This improvement is obtained without raising the operational or by the 
design difﬁculties of the Radix algorithm. In comparison to the matching index (4n

+ 3) of the standard Radix-4 DIF Fast Fourier Transform technique, the generated 
index (N + 4n-1) mod N shown in (5), since. 
The normal butterﬂy of an ordinary Radix-4 DIF Fast Fourier Transform tech-
nique, on the other hand, necessitates the use of six real twiddle factors. As a result, the 
updated approach saves 33% database queries. It’s worth noting that when the lookup 
table is used, the index generation saves money in the same way. This enhancement 
is made without increasing the algorithm’s computational or structural difﬁculties. In 
comparison to the usual Radix-4 DIF Fast Fourier Transform algorithm’s matching 
index (4n + 3), the production of new index (N + 4n − 1) mod N presented does 
not require any additional complexity. 
A typical 16 point Radix butterﬂy is shown as shown in Fig. 3 which contains 3 
stages respectively.

Conclusion 
We suggested a new enhanced Radix-4 algorithm that reduced the amount of twiddle 
factor evaluations, resulting in a reduction in computational time and the best and 
fastest results. An improved Radix-4 method is proposed in this study. The look up 
table accesses and the decrement in the number of twiddle factor evaluations has 
been achieved by the typical decomposition of the Radix-4 FFT algorithm and it 
has been demonstrated by us in this paper. Without adding any extra calculational 
or design complexity, the above mentioned results were achieved. In this study we 
have presented the core notion for the enhanced Radix-4 algorithm can be extended 
to the algorithms of DIF and DIT FFT both with greater radices, and also for the 
Fast Fourier algorithms which are multidimensional. The number of the modules of 
ROM are reduced as a result of the proposed Radix-4 FFT algorithm in the hardware 
implementation of the architectures or the designs.

1. Introduction 
The objective of steganography is to cover the actual presence of information 
exchange in unsuspecting digital media protections by embedding messages. The 
mechanisms of encryption, decryption and their usage in the protocols of commu-
nication are studied by cryptography or secret writing. In order to maintain security 
of information, both approaches transform data, although the principle of steganog-
raphy is different than cryptography. Cryptography distorts an important message, 
but it does not hide the fact that there exists a message. The objective of cryptography 
is to render third party data unreadable, while steganography is intended to hide third 
party data. Both approaches come from an older year, although the contemporary 
ﬁeld is rather young. The essential components of computer security are cryptography 
and Steganography. Cryptography is an established mathematical basis of computer 
safety and an area of computer science that is well developed and actively explored 
[1].

I. Text Steganography 
The text steganography may be categorized as embedding in character level, 
bit level and mixed type into three main classes based on the typology of embed-
ding technology. In Fig. 1 all these categories and their associated subcategories 
are indicated [2]. 
II. Audio Steganography 
Audio Steganography includes the audio as carrier message and secret 
message can be any of text, audio or image. The transmission of audio data 
is a difﬁcult problem, the little modiﬁcation of voice/speech/audio data reﬂects 
in a very signiﬁcant way. It appears to be an excellent carrier as it contains 
considerably more redundant data [3] as in Fig  2. 
III. Video Steganography 
This method can hide secret information behind a video clip in order to cover 
a huge volume of data, as demonstrated in Fig. 3.

The secret data underneath any cover image may be buried with this 
approach. In textual or visual form hidden data exist. This may be sent via 
an insecure channel after the stego image has been inserted as shown in Fig 4.

2. Steganography versus cryptography 
1. Steganalysis 
Steganalysis is the technique of analyzing steganography technologies in which the 
concealed data in a stego item is detected, extracted, destroyed and manipulated. 
Attack may be of many sorts, for instance, some attacks just conﬁrm the presence 
of hidden data, others try to discover and retrieve the hidden data, and some aim to 
destruct the hidden data by identifying the existence without trying to retrieve hidden 
data shown in Table 1.

The detection of steganography itself is sufﬁcient for uncovering even if the secret 
message is not retrieved since it is sufﬁcient to identify the presence of concealed data 
for destroying it. The detection of certain characteristics of images that are affected 
by the concealed data is often carried out via identiﬁcation. A skilled Steg analyst 
has to know the steganography instruments’ methodologies and tactics for effective 
attacks [4]. 
Some of the attacks will be: 
i. Stego only attack: For analysis, only stego objects are provided. 
ii. Known cover attack: Cover and stego are both familiar. 
iii. Known message attack: Message is known in some situations and the analysis of 
the stego object pattern can assist attack comparable systems for this embedded 
message. 
iv. 
Chosen stegoattack: Steganographic and stego object algorithms are known 
v. 
Chosen message attack: Here, Steg analyst produces example stego items from 
different steganographic tools to analyze the selected message and the algorithm 
employed is analyzed. 
vi. Known stegoattack: The object covers and technique used in steganography are 
known. 
2. Cryptanalysis 
Any form of attacker should be resisted by a secure encryption system; otherwise, 
secure communication should be unable to utilize the encryption system. The focus of 
cryptographic analysis is on the plaintext recovery despite obtaining the secret key. 
The following are detailed four common forms of cryptosystem security analysis 
attacks [5]: 
i. Ciphertext-only attack: In order to get knowledge on the plaintext or the secret 
keys, the attackers do not know the encryption method and may only test it on 
the basis of a number of ciphertext intercepts. 
ii. Known-plaintext attack: Besides the intercepted ciphertext, there are known 
plaintext-ciphertext pairings for cryptosystem decryption.

209
iii. Chosen-plaintext attack: The attackers are able not only to select or construct 
certain plaintexts and their matching cyphertexts to improve the attacking 
performance 
iv. 
Chosen-ciphertext attack: The attackers may select or generate certain cipher-
texts and acquire the appropriate complaints since they have the possibility to 
access the decryption process.

Methodologies 
In the article “An Efﬁcient Tagged VisualCryptography for ColorImages” author 
implemented a tag stamping method for color images. The tag secret adds to the 
protection to the tagged shares.Tagging is a simple operation that allows good quality 
pictures to be produced. The suggested secret-sharing method, marked in color, 
distributes the secrets of the tags and replants it with the tag secret.The secrets 
created by stacking the shares also lead to a strong visibility of the secret. This 
may be expanded further using standard matrix-based VC or probabilistic VC for 
numerous secret pictures [6]. 
In the article “Image Encryption using Secure Force Algorithm with Afﬁne Trans-
form for WSN” author provided a symmetric technique of low complexity labeled 
as Secure Force with Afﬁne Transform. The encryption component may be carried 
out using a minimal architecture consisting simply of fundamental mathematical 
operations (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, SHIFTING, SWAPPING). This can also assist 
to decrease the strain on the encoder because only the decoder performs the most 
difﬁcult key expansion procedure. The aim of this study is to analyze the safety and 
performance of the proposed approach. Using histogram, MSE and PSNR metrics, the 
performance of the technology may be assessed. The author analyzed and suggested 
that this technique provides higher PSNR and less MSE values [7]. 
In the article “New Watermark Embedding Technique using Visual Cryptography” 
author presents the brief notion of encryption and watermarking on images. This is 
why they are creating n number of shares in the secret image of progressive visual 
cryptography (PVC). PVC implies the gradual recovery of the hidden picture by 
overlaying n parts of a given secret image.They have the following scheme structure 
to share a secret image. This structure of the scheme maybe offers matrices that 
show how secret images can be shared across n shares. The structure of the scheme 
is designed in Matlab. The watermark embedding approach is applied here after the 
prediction error utilizing these pixels is found with the assistance of determining 
different sorts of pixels. This work can’t extract the watermark (secret data) from 
watermarked image (embedded image) at the same time the cover and the hidden 
image cannot be revealed [8]. 
In the article “Preserving Privacy Using Visual Cryptography in Surveillance 
Systems” a solution to the visual cryptographical monitoring system is implemented 
to save individual personal data from original imagewhich is a cost-effective and 
conﬁdential. The algorithm of facial detection detects the faces of the original true

210
G. K. Murhty and T. Kanimozhi
image and then random data replaces the detected faces to protect the identity of 
the individuals. The other image is maintained, as it can track the actions within the 
monitoring system. Whenever a suspected act takes place, independent organizations 
in the system can work together to reproduce the ﬁrst image and to identify the culprit. 
The suggested framework is based on XOR operations which are popular or even 
available as logic gates in the most basic processor architecture. The performance 
problems with XOR operations are thus disregarded. Face Detection techniques may 
cause the most serious difﬁculties in performance phase [9]. 
In the article [10] author examined the existing of Classical Cryptography (CC) 
and Quantum Cryptography (QC) works and principles utilized for encryption and 
decoding. The strengths and limitations of each encryption and decryption tech-
nology is discussed. The author focuses in this work on selecting the optimal approach 
for encrypting and decrypting images, so that researchers might have an idea of 
selecting an effective cryptography. Classical Cryptography transforms plain text 
into encrypted, i.e., cipher, to enable it to be sent across insecure exchanges of infor-
mation. A data string called “Key” controls the information translation from not 
secured content to encrypted content. Quantum cryptography is the safest method 
of data transmission since it is centered on quantum physics principles, which allow 
both parties to secure communications centered on quantum mechanics’ invulnera-
bility. The mathematical framework or set of principles used to build physical theory 
is the quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Photon 
Polarization Principle are two fundamental features of quantum cryptography that 
are reliant on quantum cryptography. Finally, quantum cryptography is certainly 
safer than that in traditional encryption, as it works on quantum mechanics prin-
ciples and the characteristics of quantum bit approaches. Quantum encryption is 
particularly beneﬁcial for safe sharing of multimedia data such as clips and photos. 
The Quantum Cryptography is in the beginning phases and much effort has to be 
completed in order to improve its performance and to overcome its limits such as the 
issues of its implementation, communication range and transfer rate [10]. 
In the article “Visual Cryptography for Color Images using Multi-level Thresh-
olding”author in this work uses multi-level thresholding/halftoning to enhance the 
acquired quality of the reproduced image to implement a visual cryptography 
approach for colors images. Previous approaches using binary halftoning can only 
have 2 variations of any color. Shade 1 is the maximum intensity color of 255 while 
Shade 2 is its modestpower of 0.The fmultilevelhalftoning approach is superior 
than binary halftoning as it allows the reconstructed image to contain more color 
shades or more information levels than the binary halftoningmethodology.Multilevel 
halftoning at 5 level reaches 15 levels of information, which would rise only further 
when the halftoning levels are increased in binary halftoning compared to the 
always-ﬁxed ﬁve levels [11]. 
In the article “An Extended Visual Cryptography Technique for Medical Image 
Security” studies of the author offer an expanded technique for the security of medical 
images in visual cryptography. Visual encryption is a way to share information 
secretly in forms such as images, text, etc. The approach suggested in the study 
encrypts the medical image ﬁrst and then incorporates it into 3 cover images. The

secret image will be rebuilt later on the receiver side, followed by its decryption, using 
three shares (meaningful). For every pixel of the secret image, the signiﬁcant shares 
utilized in the approach described employ a 3 × 3 block size. The study proposes 
no pixel expansion method for encryption. This method’s performance is evaluated 
with the SSIM, MSE and PSNR metrics. The transparency of secret images in the 
shares is high and attackers can change the secret information in shares [12]. 
In the article “Steganography in Images Using LSB Techniques” author presents 
a new technology for data hiding based on LSB digital image technology. This study 
presents an unsustainable data hiding approach utilizing LSB in images. In every 
media: text, sound, video and images, secrets may be encoded. His article addresses 
the use of Least Signiﬁcant Bit (LSB) technology for hiding texts in an image ﬁle. 
The LSB method is applied in the spatial domain, where the carrier bits are included 
in the least signiﬁcant bits of the image to generate the image of the stego. The major 
subject of this work is to embed a message in the image via a secret key or password 
into the stego system encoder. It should be kept private using this password or secret 
key. This stego image is sent to the recipient through a channel. With the same key 
or password, the stego system decodes the stego picture at the ending of the decoder. 
This work will have low embedding capacity and less in secrecy maintenance [13]. 
In this article “Holo-Entropy and AdvancedEncryption Standard for Wavelet-
Based ImageSteganography”, a technique is used in this work to hide the sound 
information in the image that uses a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).The secret 
message, which is included in audio, will initially be normalized and encrypted using 
the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) technique. The encrypted message is then 
transformed into binary data that is inserted into the cover image. Using the Wavelet 
Transform, the coefﬁcients are converted and chosen for optimum embedding using 
the holo entropic function. In the encrypted audio data, the speciﬁed coefﬁcients are 
utilized. Lastly, the embedded band has to be converted and compressed with JPEG 
to the spatial domain. The similar &opposite technique is used on the receiver side for 
the extraction of the audio message. The suggested approach of image steganography 
with the expense of holo entropy and the AES algorithm is assessed based on MSE 
and PSNR [14]. 
A text steganography approach in JPEG pictures is provided in this article “A New 
Steganography Method for Embedding Message in JPEG Images”. Text steganog-
raphy is done on the least bits in the discrete matrix, and the insertion of embedded 
message has a lesser inﬂuence on the image quality. The encoded message in the 
image is hidden with two less signiﬁcant bits of pixels. In the JPEG compression 
method before encoding, after the transformation from time to frequency space and 
exactly (or immediately) following the discretion of converted data the stegano-
graphic operation is done to the image. The suggested approach is evaluated on the 
collection of several well-known images using two standard steganography criteria, 
PSNR and capacity [15]. 
In the article “Secured Communication of Text and Audio using Image Steganog-
raphy” author suggested a securing text- and audio-steganographic communication 
utilizing an image-steganographic technique provides text and audio data security 
in a single image ﬁle. Audio recordings, as well as text ﬁles here, are transformed

212
G. K. Murhty and T. Kanimozhi
into binary and encoded using bitwise encoding into the cover ﬁle. For dual secu-
rity method the LSB algorithm is utilized. In the ﬁrst step the hidden text in the 
cover image is covered, but in the second phase the cover image ﬁle is saved with 
the secret audio ﬁle. The system presented was more efﬁcient using the approach of 
transforming wavelets. The key is separately supplied here for encoding and decoding 
but it can’t store the key in the image randomly. The ﬁnal or stego image that results 
is delivered to the receiver over the speciﬁed communication channel [16]. 
In this article “LSB Based Steganography using Dynamic Key Cryptography” 
author proposed for steganography of the space domain image. In this situation, the 
secret image’s most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) is substituted for the image element carrier 
image’s least signiﬁcant bit (LSB).The dynamic key cryptography provides security 
here, together with information hiding. This approach is designed to generate three 
sets of pseudo noise sequences that conceal the most signiﬁcant bits (MSB) in each 
pixel of the private image from least signiﬁcant bits (LSB) in each pixel of the 
carrier image. On utilizing the 192-bit key-vector we can construct a pseudo-noise 
sequence and it provides adequate security to implement the technique. Each block 
here is ciphered with an 8-bit character second key. If any attacker does a stego 
image analysis, it is only possible to get encrypted text. The four least signiﬁcant bits 
(LSB) of each pixel of the carrier images are replaced with the four most signiﬁcant 
bits (MSB) of all secret image pixel elements in the LSB steganography technique. 
Performance is evaluated based on PSNR [17]. 
This study, “Image and Text Steganography with Cryptography using MATLAB” 
combines cryptographical and steganographic security and has created a heavily 
secured model. Sequential algorithms are employed in this work for steganography 
and for cryptography, symmetric XOR is used. This article shows how to hide a text 
document in an image ﬁle and how to hide an image in another image. The app will 
initially be developed on the cloud and the input is provided via android, when the 
images from the android smartphone go to the cloud server where Matlab processes 
the images and results are delivered to the android smartphone. This work is only 
applicable to text and images ﬁles, not for video and audio ﬁles [18]. 
In this study “The author of “MP4 Steganographic in the Wavelet Trans-
fomr Domain” suggests a Mp4 steganography solution that uses the wavelet domain 
to disguise audio and visual data. A Video ﬁle contains an I frame, a P frame, and 
a B frame. An iframe or intra frame is decoded without the need for extra frames 
to be referenced. Capturing the motion is done using P frames and B-frames. The 
GOP is made up of a number of frames, including I-, P-, and B- frames. A GOP 
begins with only an I-frame, which varies in length depending on the codec used 
(excluding the second I-frame, the number of frames between two I-frames). They 
are chosen for integration because I frames through compression or other types of 
signal processing techniques are not lost. For embedding, appropriate I-frames and 
audio frame pixels are used without affecting the video’s perceptual qualities. To 
avoid the loss of frames, redundant copies of secret data are produced. The audio 
frame mask the secret sound/audio, whereas the frames conceal the hidden visuals. 
The integer wavelet transformation is used to convert the concealed image and audio 
data, and the low frequency coefﬁcients remain hidden [19].

Methodologies in Steganography and Cryptography–Review
213
In this article “Secure Video Steganography Technique using DWT and H.264”, a 
safe calculation of the video steganography using Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), 
based on the calculation of the movement object, and H.264, the use of Mat laboratory 
programming is presented. By utilizing bit shifting and H.264 to encode secret details, 
the secret message is prepared beforehand. In order to recognize local excitement for 
the moving articles, moving object detection calculation will ﬁrst be updated with 
the host records. At that stage, it is the job of the information dissimilar process to 
insert the secret message image to the discrete wavelet that transforms the planes of 
all motion zones on the base of the video [20].

Conclusion 
This study mainly focused on introducing several approaches of steganography and 
cryptography. As we stated previously, both cryptography and steganography offer 
different data protection characteristics across the network. But they have not given 
accurate results if they are not utilized in combination form. LSB is the most used 
technology, however, but it has so many disadvantages that it decreases image quality 
and also generates suspicions. And a very few works where found on video processing 
of both steganography and cryptography. So, in future we can implement a technique 
based on steganography and cryptography in video processing which is more effective 
than pre-existing works.

Introduction 
To enhance the data transmission security in network, steganography along with cryp-
tography are utilized mutually by means of wavelets described by several researchers. 
Basically, in discrete wavelet transform “Filter bank investigation” might be utilized 
for examining signal images by passing all the way through it. The covert informa-
tion which is surrounded in carrier that may help to protected from malevolent users 
sending to receiver based on steganography. Both steganography and cryptography 
approaches were introduced to covert the top secret message in the form of audio, 
video or image ﬁles. The principles utilized in cryptography during data transmission 
are mentioned as follows. 
(1) Encryption and Decryption technique-Converting original information into 
incomprehensible format hence the data is very secure which comes under 
encryption method. And then the cipher text is coverted into original form using 
decryption process to retrieve the original data. Either similar keys or dissimilar 
keys are utilized for both encrypting and decrypting the data. 
(2) Validation/Authentication-Validation is one of the major part in cryptography 
algorithm that the message was started by the originator stated in the message. 
This is possible if the sender performs some operation on the message that the 
recipient only knows the message originator may perform. 
(3) Reliability.

The loss of message reliability is a prevalent concern in communication, 
which implies that using cryptographic hashes, cryptography should ensure 
that the messages received by the recipient are not altered anywhere along the 
communication path. 
(4) Without negation. 
This is a condition in which the sender may claim that he or she did not transmit 
the message to the intended recipient. With the use of computerized marks, 
cryptography maintains this type of situation. 
The beneﬁt of utilizing the combination of both cryptography and steganography 
is to transfer the data very secure among transmitter and receiver side. The main 
objective of steganography is to remain the availability of covert data when broad-
casting message in network. Also the objective of cryptography is to send the data as 
hidden information to transmit the data in a secure manner. Hence we surveyed how 
steganography and cryptography techniques used in encrypt/decrypt the message. 
To transfer the data with protection during data transmission. This survey focused 
on secure data transmission using steganography and cryptography are described as 
follows.
• To send the data/information from sender to receiver using cryptography and 
steganography in a secure manner
• To improve the security of information during message sending as hidden data 
which is embedded with either image ﬁle or audio or video ﬁle. 
The contribution of this survey is to construct safe and also undetectable passing 
of data, we introduced this survey for highlighting how secure transmission had done 
via cryptography and steganography based technique. 
The plain text is embedded with secret key along with secret message as stego 
image to secure the data from hacker who is stealing data.

Background 
Vasanth et al. [1] and Laskar et al. [2] introduced steganography based Joint Photo-
graphic Expert Group along with exchange encryption method. Moreover this JPEG 
method utilized Discrete Cosine Transform approach that utilized in occurrence area 
for concealed encrypted message inside the images. This proposed work was evalu-
ated by measuring metrics such as Peak Signal Noise Ratio and Mean Square Error. 
Marwa et al. [3] A combined approach for data protection has been introduced in 
this paper which utilizes cryptography and steganography techniques to enhance 
the security of information. To begin, the secret data was encrypted via enhanced 
version of AES algorithm. Followed by that RSA algorithm was utilized to covert 
the encrypted data. Accordingly, this hybrid based method presented two levels of 
protection. In addition, this hybrid approach has the ability to generate maximum 
quality stego images and also maximum embedding capability.

Approaches Used by Existing Researchers 
In this section we are discussing about the different methods used for secure data 
transmission among transmitter and receiver using cryptography and steganography 
techniques. Chandra et al. [4] introduced novel algorithm by which the covert data 
inside cover image or audio to hide the reality of cipher text and also that image is 
converted from transmitter to receiver by raising the linking between them to attain 
data accuracy. Here, RSA cryptographic algorithm, image steganography and RMI 
framework were utilized for secure data transmission. 
3.1 
RSA Algorithm 
The algorithm which utilizes two algebraic structures of public key cryptography 
method namely 
Public key as
 u p er R e
quals upper Z n plus upper X
and 
Public key as
 u p er  G equals  
upp
In this algorithm, initially two prime numbers are chosen and their products are 
utilized to produce both public and private key are provided in Eqs. (1) and (2) 
respectively. 
Image steganography–In this process, the images are utilized as covering object 
of data/information during data communication among sender and receiver. 
RMI architecture–Remote Method Invocation makes the client–server associa-
tion. First the server builds an object and also creates its permission slightly. Then 
the client accepts acknowledge or object reference on the server side and then call 
upon the function on it. The border utilized by sender-receiver objects to make the 
inaccessible link is presented via outer layer, stubs, inaccessible reference and also 
TLP layer. 
Bandela et al. [5] proposed novel technique comprises of both steganography and 
cryptography for transmitting data as covert message very securely named as crypto-
stego technique. This approach helps to locate an image inside another different 
image. The sendersends the message with encryption to secure the data by hiding 
with images while the receiver receives the data and perform decryption technique to 
obtain original image. The proposed framework of data transmission using crypto-
stego technique is depicted in Fig. 1.
Shenoy et al. [6] introduced that the data is hidden by means of Least Signiﬁcant 
Bit with images and also the plain text is encrypted using RSA algorithm, the URL is 
sent to the receiver side with the combination of both cryptography and steganography

Fig. 1 Framework for data transmission using crypto-stego
technique by Singh et al. [7] for secure data transmission. The receiver decrypts the 
message via similar cryptography-based RSA algorithm. If some unknown person 
tries to steal the data, he can get only URL not the secret data. Kannadhasan et al. 
[8] focused on merging of cryptography and steganography to transmit the data in 
a protected manner using Internet of Things. Saraireh et al. [9] proposed ﬁlter bank 
cipher technique which helps to encrypt the text or messages that afforded maximum 
level of scalability, velocity and protection. The diagrammatic representation of both 
encryption and decryption process demonstrates by in Fig. 2. 
The hidden message is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard method 
in sender side and the secret message is retrieved by receiver using steganography 
based algorithm by Saleh et al. [9] focused on hybrid approach which enhances the 
data in secure manner during data communication. This hybrid method generates 
maximum embedding capacity and also quality of stego images increased. Vishnu 
Babu et al. [10] reviewed many articles regarding secure data transmission between 
sender and receiver in several methods with cryptography approaches like RSA, AES 
and steganography algorithms such as LSB, DCT, DWT.

Steganography Based Data Transmission 
Ambika et al. [11] introduced novel approach which has two phases namely data 
transmission and data extraction. During data transmission, the covert information 
is preprocessed and encrypted using RSA algorithm in the meantime pre-processing 
of wrapped image is executed and also knight tour approach is used to create path 
for knight. During data extraction phase, the information received from sender are 
decrypted to attain the hidden data using Discrete Wavelet Transform approach which 
results in secure data transmission. Also, efﬁcient image based data or informa-
tion linked approach were developed. The essential well designed picture of simple 
steganography is characterized in Fig. 3. 
Goudar et al. [12] determines the new technique for safe data broadcasting between 
transmitter–receiver communication by covering the data with Transmission Control 
Protocol or Internet Protocol via steganography based approaches. The overall frame-
work for performing encryption and decryption process for secure data transmission 
is depicted in Fig. 4.
Nyo et al. [13] introduced new encryption algorithm especially Twisted exchange 
method to strengthen the security purpose during data communication among trans-
mitter and receiver. The action performed on sender side is depicted in Fig. 5 and 
receiver side is shown in Fig. 6.

Data Transfer Using Video Steganography 
For secure data transmission, the sender sends data or message in video format which 
is explained by Gunjan et al. [14]. This work focused on the combination of both 
steganography and cryptography algorithm for protecting the data within several 
multimediaﬁles such as video, audio and images depicted in Fig. 7. 
Kolakalur et al. [15] focused on data security by means of hiding data with video 
series contained by another video series. At sender side, the covert data is concealed 
with least signiﬁcant wavelet form in the structure of video format. The hidden data 
inside video ﬁle is retrieved in reverse order of LSB shown in Fig. 8. The metrics 
such as Peak Signal Noise Ratio, and Mean square error were estimated to ﬁnd the 
video series quality.

In embedding process, the data encryption has done with discrete wavelet 
transform whereas data decryption has performed using Inverse Discrete Wavelet 
Transform to retrieve the digital data in stego format.

Image Steganography for Data Transmission 
Saravanan et al. [16] introduced new method for hiding image information by trans-
lating it into a different format, which minimizes computing complexity and the 
proposed diagram is shown in Fig. 9.
The data transfer between sender and receiver with high security using DWT 
(Discrete Wavelet Transform) which has large capacity steganography by Ravi et al. 
[17]. On the cover picture, Haar and biorthogonal DWT are utilized separately, also 
on the payload image, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) along with alterations is 
utilized to translate the payload image into an encrypted image. The payload image’s 
coefﬁcients are placed within the cover image’s high frequency bands. Finally DWT 
algorithm was implemented using ARM8 processor. 
7 
Data Transmission Using Image Cryptography 
Murugan et al. [18] explained that discrete wavelet transform is better for secure 
data transmission when compared to discrete cosine transform approach. This is due 
to scalability of quality, interest in region coding, low bit rate transmission that is 
quick to operate, and compatibility with the human visual system, which gives good 
perception quality. This method extends the merged region and enhances the security. 
Therefore the outcome of discrete wavelet transform reaches more indiscernible with 
PSNR ranges from 30 to 54 decibels. This work performed two phases for secure 
data transmission namely embedding and decoding.

Fig. 9 Proposed diagram
Embedding process–The data are hiding secretly with images by means of 2 
dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform and the concealed data are isolated using 
Haar wavelet. 
Decoding process–Decoding is similar to decryption process to decrypt the infor-
mation as plain text for attaining secret message by using two-dimensional Discrete 
Wavelet Transform. 
The qualities of images are enhanced via the wavelet coefﬁcient with low level 
frequency. LPF represents Low Pass Filter which helps to down sample the rows and 
HPF points the high pass ﬁlter for down sample columns as shown in Fig. 10.
Kuri et al. [19] proposed IoT based technique along with combination of steganog-
raphy and cryptography approaches for secure and consistent data exchanging. 
Moreover, elliptic Galois cryptography was established for encrypting the plain text 
message and then XOR rules was applied to insert the encrypted data and ﬁnally 
decrypts the message with CNN method to attain original message. 
Asymmetric key encryption approach is otherwise called Elliptic Galois Cryptog-
raphy which comprises of CNN encryption and elliptic curve described in Fig. 11. 
This proposed scheme enhances the effectiveness of estimation and also diminishes 
the difﬁculty of rounding errors.

Data Transmission Using Cryptography 
Dogra et al. [20] surveyed many papers for understanding how secure the data is 
transmitting between sender and receiver in wireless sensor networks. This survey 
undergoes two phases namely ﬁnding and improvement. Finding provides the clari-
ﬁcation for competence and dependable protection needs cryptography algorithms. 
Moreover, this review clariﬁes the overall security problems in WSN. 
Chavan et al. [21] suggested symmetric and asymmetric algorithms for secure data 
communication between sender and receiver. The sender messages are encrypted 
using private key based algorithm namely AES and the receiver messages are

Conclusions 
We surveyed several articles related with how the cryptographic and steganographic 
algorithms used during data communication between sender and receiver. For secure 
data transmission, the sender encrypts the data by hiding with images using crypto-
graphic algorithms and the receiver decrypt the hidden data via decryption process. 
From this we conclude that these approaches were applied to enhance the data security 
while performing data transmission in network environment.

A Review: Object Detection 
and Classiﬁcation Using Side Scan Sonar 
Images via Deep Learning Techniques 
K. Sivachandra and R. Kumudham

Introduction 
Many side scan sonar (SSS) systems have been used because they can have image 
vast areas of the seaﬂoor with a reasonably high resolution in a limited amount of 
time. Frequently utilized chart in seabed with a high coverage rate for a variety of 
applications, including development of underwater identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation, 
maritime maps, features of bathymetry and artifacts. Modern UUVs utilize Side Scan 
Sonar (SSS) as their primary imaging sensor for detecting and classifying (mine-like) 
objects on the seaﬂoor. These systems are very complicated. It is low-cost, well-
understood, and widely accessible. However, achieving high resolution and coverage 
in a large region, it’s impossible to use a traditional SSS and a conventional SSS at the 
same time. This is a fundamental ﬂaw in these systems. To know about these kinds 
of information related with underwater acoustics, this paper focused on survey on 
several existing work. Nayak et al. [18] focused on enhancing the image processing 
procedure to categorize the probable regions of awareness more efﬁciently. This 
work was based on three assistance in the area of underwater robotics comprises of
• A pipeline that processes an algorithm for identifying archaeological sites. SSS 
data was obtained by AUV in order to locate underwater archaeological sites of 
interest.

Object Detection in Underwater 
2.1 
SSS Images 
Chang et al. [3] tried Fuzzy C-mean clustering method to segment every pixel in 
image especially SSS image into several clusters that creates shaded portions be 
partitioned. Here the work focused on solitary simpliﬁed underwater object detection 
method by means of shadow removal of SSS images. This scheme attained better 
performance in object identiﬁcation with sturdiness and efﬁciency. 
Fuzzy C-means Algorithm 
To attain shadow segmentation from sonar images, initially they performed image 
pre-processing to extract the relevant features followed by that applied FCM algo-
rithm which is a repetitive clustering procedure. The least cost function generated 
to yield an optimal c segment through clustering process was speciﬁed as following

Fuzzy approach comes together to the clustering clariﬁcation by means of 
exploring for least cost function. The FCM algorithm halts while the membership 
function in some succeeding replications does not alter. The objects in underwater 
images were distinguished by marking every pixel as the gray value sets to 255 to 
carry out reintegration and attain customized image named as Y. The object detection 
and segmentation using underwater images comprise of several steps proceeded by 
[3]. Initially images were collected regarding sonar, followed by that segmented the 
images, removal of shadow, and ﬁnally detection of objects (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Target Detection and 
segmentation by [3] 
Song et al. [30] focused on segmenting underwater SSS images based on MRF 
and ELM. Here, the sonar images were partition into several segments for high light-
ening objects, shading objects, identifying noise regions from SSS images. Initially, 
the author utilized ensemble method comprised of SE-ELM, ELM-MRF and then 
SE-ELM-MRF to attain the prediction form. Then the investigation regarding object 
detection were tested with machine learning algorithms namely xtreme learning, 
xtreme learning with kernel based, SVM and CNN. Among these algorithms, 
ensemble technique outperformed in segmentation of sonar images compared to 
conventional approaches. The ﬂowchart for ensemble algorithm SE-ELM-MRF 
method is shown in Fig. 2 by [30]. 
The deep learning based CNN approach were utilized for segmenting sonar images 
to detect objects in both underwater and surface of the sea. The CNN architecture 
utilized by [30] is depicted in Fig. 3.
Matsuda et al. [16] introduced novel technique known as One Shot Detector that 
realized object identiﬁcation exclusive of machine learning approaches and algo-
rithms. OSD is the process of amalgamation of region extraction procedure and 
outline image procedure. Moreover, the author found that this OSD approach was

completely appropriate for discovering underwater coercion, objects available in sea 
using SSS images even without using any machine learning technique. The segmen-
tation of images had performed in underwater for identifying threats shown in Fig. 4 
by Matsuda et al. 
The overview of One shot Detector such as image collection, segmentation, shape 
representation and ﬁnally shape matching is illustrated in Fig. 5 by [16].
To improve the overall model “One Shot Detector” performance, the author eval-
uated classiﬁcation accuracy which attained around 90% without using any machine 
learning models. In addition, confusion matrix were estimated for comparing the 
actual class and predicted class which helps to ﬁnding threats in underwater via SSS 
images easily shown in Table 1.
The processing time duration got reduced using region selective sparse coding 
based SR device which highlights the area of objects in sonar SSS images found 
by Park et al. [25]. The highlighted area which comprised of identiﬁed objects in 
SSS underwater images hence the successive sparse coding based SR procedure 
was applied selectively. The efﬁciency of this work was processing time reduction 
for reconstructing images nevertheless maintain the similar intensity of perception 
quality of images as conservative approach. 
The following Fig. 6 illustrate that the SSS images were generated along with 
excellent resolution.

The image depicted in Fig. 7 how the objects were categorized on underwater 
SSS images using classiﬁcation process. 
Buscombe et al. [5] focused on elimination of acoustic shadows, sea water ﬂoor 
detection, interface for conditions such as while the sea water is excessively muddy or 
turmoil for consistent intensity echo sounding also seaﬂoor substrate categorization 
based on single-beam full waveform analysis. In addition these approaches were 
programmed in an open source software package that make possible to utilize in 
reconstruction of SSS images automatically. The sonar images were segmented to 
detect the target objects in underwater through Xtreme machine learning by Song 
et al. [36]. The author has chosen ELM technique to attain greater performance along 
with higher learning speed. ELM approach were utilized as classiﬁers in deep learning 
based CNN to classify the sonar images in several pathways which can ﬁnd out 
mutually narrow and worldwide attributes from SSS images.An effective approach 
namely subtractive sequential analysis was realized so as to improve the MBES 
object identiﬁcation procedure by Brissette et al. [2]. Additionally, automated iden-
tiﬁcation algorithm was utilized effectively on sequentially distinguished images. 
The comparison was made among the related work, implementation and outcomes 
of MBES to attain detection accuracy via SSS images. Huo et al. [8] proposed deep 
learning based CNN algorithm for several classiﬁcation such as drown, wreck, mine, 
airplane and seabed in SSS images. At ﬁrst, the author created real SSS image dataset 
called Seabed objects-KLSG comprised of wreck 385, drown 36, airplane 62, mine 
129 and seabed images as 578. Here, they applied deep CNN with semisynthetic 
data to train the data that achieved greater accuracy as 97.7% in underwater object 
detection and classiﬁcation. The CNN architecture given in Fig. 8 by Huo et al. [8].
Zhao et al. [38] to attain comprehensive seaﬂoor façade image the author intro-
duced SSS image assortment approach via CFP along with restriction of pathway 
line location. Within the overlap regions, the feature point recognition in sonar image 
furthermore listing operations was implemented for mutually strips. In accordance

with discovered CFP along with pathway line location, ﬁne tuning method was recog-
nized to hold difﬁcult local deformation and also guarantee the worldwide constancy. 
This process resolves the issue of object interruption as well as no accumulated inac-
curacy occurs in mosaicking procedures. The side scan sonar images were segmented 
using deep based CNN technique to attain greater performance by Song et al. [35]. 
2.1.1
Automatic AUV 
The investigator discovered a scheme for intellectual search of aquaplane through 
AUV. Here the author applied machine learning methods to recognize the prospec-
tive prehistorically sites from AUV on side scan sonar data. Data expansion and 
image attribute removal are two methods offered in the proposed algorithm to boost 
performance over conventional CNN approaches. In addition investigational veri-
ﬁcation in the form of AUV deployments off the coast of Malta, this culminated 
in the discovery of archaeologically important sites. The block diagram and CNN 
architecture for side scan sonar processing pipeline is shown in Figs. 9 and 10 by 
[18]. 
Gebhardt et al. [4] utilized deep learning based neural network algorithms to 
resolve the issues of identifying objects such as mine, rock, sand, clay etc. on under-
water seabed using side scan sonar images. Moreover, they applied machine learning 
algorithm namely support vector machine to detect the underwater objects and 
found the detection accuracy. Also they performed comparison among both machine 
learning and deep learning algorithm in which deep learning achieved greater accu-
racy as 93% whereas svm attained 78% in object recognition on seabed. Finally, they

insisted that this work were appropriate for embedded utilize with UUV. Li et al. [13] 
concepts mainly focused on how Deep learning based NN distinguish the objects in 
SSS images with no training datas/ samples. 
The proposed deep learning architecture during training phase and also testing 
phase is described in Fig. 11. 
Petrich et al. [26] introduced AUVs for improvement and investigational valida-
tion of SSS based on self localization algorithms. The relevant attributes with dissim-
ilar classes were extorted from dual frequency sonar images via machine visualiza-
tion and consequently used to produce sparse bathymetric maps. The range inside 
the attribute set means attributes of dissimilar sizes and attributes mined at unlike 
sonar operating frequencies permits for vigorous multi-modal attribute matching. 
The segmentation of SSS images were executed by AUV for achieving more effec-
tive, efﬁcient and exact object identiﬁcation by Yu et al. [37]. With the aim of better 
detection of seaﬂoor information the author applied one algorithm which consists of 
data augmentation, super resolution technology, deep learning and MRF.

2.1.2
Live Recorded Images/Videos 
Han et al. [9] the primary key approach for underwater development was to identify 
and place the foremost object from underwater visualization. To detect the target 
objects, the author applied deep learning based CNN where the kind of informa-
tion gathered from Remote Operated Vehicle to attain good results. Moreover, the 
relevant features mined from the videos/images were carried out using RPN called 
Region Proposal Network. The author proved that this discovery helpful in real time 
application for detecting objects via videos in seabed or underwater acoustics. The 
deep learning based CNN architecture were proposed by [9] for extracting features 
from images, object recognition and classifying the objects from underwater images 
is depicted in Fig. 12. 
Nikolovska et al. [21] object recognition enhancement attained by fusing infor-
mation from speciﬁc sensors namely Recorded camera, SSS, BOSS and MBES. 
The main goal was time interruption beam forming which generated the outcomes as 
Voxel layer as well as synthetic Aperture Sonar processing. However, the recognition 
of objects and classiﬁcation of objects as mine or non-mine from sensor based sonar 
images had performed with greater precision within least time duration. Through 
remote sensing approach, the objects found on the ocean ﬂoor were identiﬁed using 
SSS images established by Okoli et al. [24]. Similar to object detection, the docu-
ments were recognized using gradient based learning algorithm proposed by Lecun 
et al. [34]. Generative Adversarial Network based algorithm was introduced by Sung 
et al. [32] which produce realistic sonar images. This deep learning based approach 
were utilized for target recognition which performed the underwater activities like 
wreckage, unwanted feature elimination, as well as landmark based navigation were 
computerized.

Sonar Images 
Ochal et al. [23] introduced deep learning based CNN normally applied for object 
detection in underwater acoustics on both images (Sonar, optical). Moreover, huge 
amount of data or images can be moderately very expensive and prolonged too while 
examining extraordinary objects or executing real time processes. The author discov-
ered novel approach namely Few Shot Learning were utilized for object recognition 
in underwater seabed automatically as well as enlarged their knowledge competence. 
Comparison had prepared among supervised and semi-supervised using underwater 
optical and SSS images. Using FSL methods, an average gain of 7% accuracy points 
over the ConvNet baseline, with up to 8.6% on optical datasets while on sonar 
images, up to 16.8%. Anitha et al. [1] applied image processing technique for recog-
nition of objects either on seabed or under the seawater using sonar images. The 
input images given by sonar technology were gray scale images forever. The step 
by step procedure was put forth by [1] discovery of objects in sonar images such 
as removal of noises from images, detection of edges, and ﬁnally image catego-
rization. Among these three steps, detection of edges in images plays a signiﬁcant 
role in image discovery and classiﬁcation. Here, assessments were performed among 
edge based detection via fuzzy approach and block processing approach. Lee et al. 
[28] introduced a real time simulated dataset for object recognition in underwater 
sonar images using style transferred learning technique. To train the images related 
with sonar, style transfer learning methods were applied for object identiﬁcation in 
underwater acoustics. Feldens et al. [7] determined network based structure specif-
ically RetinaNet for object recognition in underwater via sonar images in addition 
to distinguish rocks from mine in backscatter mosaics rooted from SSS working 
at 384 kHz. The object detection and categorization depended straightforwardly on 
accurate resolution of underwater acoustics images were performed involuntarily by 
Langner et al. [12]. The author collected images from FU-Berlin and also FGAN-
FOM for detecting objects and undergoes classiﬁcation too. The procedures followed 
by [12] are Pre-processing the images comprised of normalization, altitude evaluation 
along with slope range improvement, and ﬁnally geo-referencing. Several screening 
approaches like arithmetical attributes, threshold segmentation, analysis of shadow 
region in sonar images, one dimensional cross association, MSER method, k means 
algorithm, highly order statistic based segmentation were applied for implementing 
sonar images for object recognition and classiﬁcation. Probabilistic based NN were 
utilized for classifying images for distinguishing mine or rock. The datasets were 
gathered lively by SeaOtter AUV from Atlas Elekronik, Batli and Mediterranean Sea 
in which dissimilar SSS schemes were utilized in different zones. These algorithms 
were evaluated by monitoring the sea approximately 25 km2 of the seabed. As a 
result of negative cause of sound on several object recognition, Nguyen et al. [20] 
applied clustering approaches such as k-means, density based clustering equally on 
sonar based images and 3-D point cloud LiDAR datas to enhance the performance in 
underwater object detection. Especially, the density based clustering with noise suit-
able to remove noises in sonar images. The author proposed this method in domain

namely maritime application regarding object recognition, and autonomous driving 
system. 
The CNN structure designed in Fig. 13 by Nguyen et al. [20] as a overall framework 
for object recognition, object classiﬁcation using underwater SSS images. 
The Fully Convolution Network model formation in Fig. 14 was designed by 
[20] to extort multiple objects out of the background in underwater sonar images to 
organize the input data for the clustering methods. 
Priyadharshini et al. [27] introduced edge based segmentation approach which 
utilized the morphological operations for ﬁnding edges in sonar images followed 
by that they proposed object tracing algorithm to track the objects in underwater 
acoustics on sonar images. The sonar images were pre-processed using ﬁltering 
techniques such as median ﬁlter, Wiener ﬁlter and also morphological gradient were 
attained by means of deduct dilated and eroded image. 
Sheffer et al. [29] determined the procedure for modifying as well as restructuring 
[11] the image based on sonar that uses normalization comprised of slant range

Four (A, B, C, D) autonomous steps which had done in analogous to reconstruct

Doherty et al. [6] introduced three phases for object identiﬁcation and classiﬁca-
tion were performed as 
Phase 1: Object recognition-utilizes thresholding approach attached with adaptive 
averaging approach to place OOI in SSS images. 
Phase 2: Classiﬁcation-applied binary classiﬁcation algorithm for classifying 
objects as either mine or non-mine. This categorization was attained with feature 
based decision tree. 
Phase 3: Identiﬁcation-Mark the regions where the objects found in sonar images. 
Sung et al. [31] identiﬁed the cross talk noises on sonar images through image 
based neural network framework and removed noises from that speciﬁed images 
based on detection identiﬁcation. To attain their target and improve the consistency 
of proposed approach, the author applied NN method to 3-D point cloud creation 
and produced more number of precise cloud point. Sung et al. [32] introduced deep 
learning approach for underwater object detection that is still needed to automate 
underwater activities like wreck examination, extract reduction, and landmark based 
navigation. This approach manufactured real sonar images using GAN as Generative 
Adversarial Network. This paper proposed methods that synthesize realistic sonar 
images using a Generative Adversarial Network. 
2.1.4
Hardware Based Object Detection 
Hossain et al. [10] introduced deep learning technique for identifying trashes on 
underwater sonar images which helps in object detection and classiﬁcation. In this, 
they attached ultrasonic sonar sensor on robot which identiﬁes the objects besides 
the pathway. Also, the camcorder unit launches the images of sonar objects to the 
speciﬁc hardware mentioned as Raspberry pi to categorize the images as either trash 
or non-trash. The robot utilized for implementation discover broad assortment of 
trash that reaches very accuracy and least expenditure too. The hardware utilized 
for implementation are Arduino Mega 2560, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Motor 
Driver (L298N), Raspberry Pi 3 Raspberry Pi camera module, DC Motors, Servo 
Motors (MG996R), and Power source. The CNN framework in Fig. 16 is illustrated.

Detection of objects on sonar images-Here the objects that are less that 30 cm were 
detected using ultrasonic sensor, then those objects are moved to hardware (Raspberry 
pi) and trashes had found using deep learning technique. After the discovery of 
objects, it was to be recognized as trash or non trash. Initially the image resolution 
was speciﬁed as 64*64 pixels. Then data were divided into 70%, 20% and 10% as for 
training, testing and validation phases. Followed by that, they applied Convolutional 
Neural Network layer of 1D, 2D and 3D for attaining better optimization. The overall 
CNN layers used for detecting trashes are depicted in Fig. 16. Once the objects were 
identiﬁed as trashes using deep learning technique, then Raspberry pi drive the alarm 
to Arduino which made started the servo motor to function.

Bubble Detection 
Several investigators experimented based on object detection in underwater, achieves 
greatest outcomes along with higher performance. Analogous to object detection in 
underwater sea/ocean, or surface of the sea/ocean, Uchimoto et al. [33] detected 
bubbles in shallow sea or ocean ﬂoor on SSS images that makes helpful for maritime 
applications in real time.

Pipeline Detection in Underwater 
Prasad et al. [14] introduced that the pipeline detection in underwater sea for investi-
gation from visual data incorporated with pictures or videos which were analyzed via 
machine learning along with deep learning algorithms. Hence the pipelines which 
were collected from deep sea videos recorded from the attached camera at LVOONL 
islands located in Norway which was detected at the deepness of 260 m to attain better

performance in detection as well as categorizing outcomes with accuracy measure as 
76.2% and AUC as 87.5%. Here, every classiﬁer was validated by tenfold cross vali-
dation by examining that the essentials of every class were spread equally in every 
one of the folds. The performance of the models was evaluated by certain metrics 
namely accuracy, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) average scores (Table 2). 
Finally the confusion matrix was evaluated to compare the actual value with 
the predicted value for classifying the images or videos into mine like objects in 
underwater seabed. The sample ﬁgure illustrates that the discovered species found 
from recorded video utilized for constructing the training dataset for indication to 
perform classiﬁcation automatically as depicted in Fig. 17.

Introduction 
Fiber connects and central optical Networks associated with optical exchanging 
components, from one side to the other, can support a huge measure of trafﬁc for 
global or even international data transmission and empowerment for data trading and 
serve many customers [1]. Network communication application requirements have 
shaped the development of events and conﬁgured/programmed optical communica-
tion [2]. In addition to the characteristics of programming conﬁgured on the control 
plane and the development of bringing the administrative plane together, naturally 
conﬁgured optical communication needs a keen calculation to advise the control 
plane communication [3]. The network trafﬁc of nearby network access networks is 
collected and maintained in communication ring communication, allowing numerous 
client supporters and centralized optical communication [4]. The electronic edge 
switches of central optical communication are essentially the total number of trafﬁc 
streams from communication [5]. 
Figure 1 gives the: Optical Network (ON) administrators experienced a wide 
range of transfer speed prerequisites, driven by the knowledge that future commu-
nication should offer higher limits, higher adaptability, and higher uninterrupted 
quality. Besides, to meet these highlights, such optical communication should offer 
multiplexing exchange functions, which were seen as a ﬁnancially effective way 
to reduce general organization speculation and activity costs [6]. Accordingly, the 
Frequency Division Multiplexed Optical System (FDMOS) is now generally called 
upon to assist in high data transfer capacity, signiﬁcant distance transmission [7]. The 
Optical Network (NW) is based on improving the network process and establishing 
communication connected to the Internet and internationally [8].

Adjustments should be made to accomplish certain objectives, for example, load 
adjusting, green systems administration, limit boost [9]. It is similarly described as a 
conﬁguration of the draw out organization stage to determine the ideal processes from 
the structure’s conﬁguration to manage assets’ distribution [10]. Despite the stretched 
conﬁguration, the transient conﬁguration is more solid than the optical communica-
tion conﬁguration [11]. A trafﬁc request is usually generated with a short interval 
between the conﬁguration phase and the sending phase [12]. Network communication 
certainty of a real foundation, the inability of a real level when a sub-ideal property 
or path can be given due to calculation or a speciﬁc strategy [13]. This proposal 
centers around a conﬁgured transient optical organization, including directing calcu-
lations, frequency function, recovery recovery-based optical organization, trafﬁc prep 
strategy, and optical light path security [14]. 
In Optical Network (ON) communication operating in a non-direct system, the 
tool to allow basic and productive non-line vulnerabilities is fundamental [15]. Such 
a device should anticipate the nature of the transmission of light paths traveling 
through different steering lanes in optical communication, which leads to a pattern 
of non-direct weak interaction between those signals. The direct non-interruption 
approval device should also capture these various highlights to assess the signal 
quality and the forecast’s completion [16]. To improve the organization’s limits in 
this new period of sending rational broadcasts, the restricted organization should 
make productive use of assets [17]. In any case, what are the assets and inevitability 
in optical communication and how can use these resources within the limits of the 
increase in multifaceted information trafﬁc and research into the imaginative develop-
ment that comes with sending the ﬁfth era of radio access networks became progress 
to enable more bandwidth.

Related Work 
Optical Network (ON) correspondence is one of the promising answers for devel-
oping transfer speed in full-scale networks for a wide range of indoor and outdoor 
applications. In miniature-sized communication, Optical Network (ON) is indicated 
at the end as an interconnect innovation to provide effective correspondence in a 
Network On-Chip (NOC) [18]. The uninterrupted expansion in the thickness of the 
preparation centers is not only based on individual metal interconnections, as they 
have a congenital barrier to correspondence data transmission and the use of force 
[2, 14]. 
Optical correspondence with thin linewidth laser sources makes the pulse between 
wanted and moderate icons crossest lock-in communication with simultaneous data 
transmission on an Electron Detector (ED). However, the effect of the barrier on 
correspondence has not been investigated; also, the source of information may be non-
compressed, as opposed to many distributed functions [3]. Indoor infrared remote 
correspondence arranged in a Bit Obscure Probability (BEP), where the be beat 
barrier restriction system is considered. In such communication with large linewidth 
optical sources (e.g., Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)), striking commitments become 
negligible, resulting in an improvement on the barrier [4]. 
Error analysis cannot be applied with limited linewidth laser sources; inconsistent 
quality is a prerequisite for correspondence structure, which is regularly estimated 
in words. Investigation of other correspondence enforcement measures [5, 17]. By 
conﬁguring a blockchain mindful structure, the organization architect can ﬁnd the 
ideal setup that meets the dependencies required for non-chip correspondence. For 
instance, the number of connections using the same frequency, and with the goal of 
distance, the distance that completes the required degree of reliability will separate 
them [6]. 
The optical encoding scheme is based on ambiguous stage encoding, in which 
the optical code is randomly selected from the code set for code jumping. Security 
enforcement is being investigated [7]. Space-Division Multiplexing Elastic Optical 
Networks (SDM-IONS) will play an important role in trending their expanded 
Internet trafﬁc due to their range of use adaptability and prevailing limitations [8]. 
However, except for Personal Physical Level Defects (PLIs), the recently released 
Cross Stall Luck (CST) conﬁrms the transmission quality in conjunction with the 
future administration’s ﬂight. As such, planning more clever and powerful asset 
task calculations can be daunting [9]. The rise of human-made brainpower provides 
an uncertain answer to such issues. The standard response to short-pull ﬁber-optic 
interchanges is not to send a sensible system, i.e., to tweak and only to identify light 
power [10]. In such a system, the sign interferes with the Optical Network (ON) and 
is confused with the electrical smoke. The limits of any sensible optical connections 
have been broadly focused on optical seasons or cozy crunch. It can complete the 
integral security level with a short-wave example, expertly improving the structure’s 
property [11, 16].

The business opportunity, communication and research communication are exam-
ining the next steps to take the market [12, 16]. One promising empowerment inno-
vation has emerged in response to the Passive Optical Network (PONs), providing 
enormous data transmission for correspondence and supporting extended interest 
[13, 17, 18]. Previously it had become one of the backbones for the giant for the 
transmission of information. Getting closer to the ﬁnal client is becoming more 
common as the need for high-speed data transmission develops [14]. In this conﬁg-
uration of integrating and empowering innovations, the task examines the source for 
providing different repetition channels. The Fourier transformation varies rapidly 
from the optical space to the repetition ﬁeld, and so on, and the use of different 
regulation systems [15, 18].

Materials and Method 
Fiber optics have become the center of our broadcast communications and informa-
tion planning system. Second optical ﬁber is the preferred transmission method for 
any information over two or three megabytes per second and over one kilometer. 
The original ﬁber optic associations were used. The optical ﬁber is a substitute for 
copper links for long-distance piece transmission over long distances. Another era of 
ﬁber-optic associations is just emerging. Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing 
(DWDM) associations use the ﬁber limit to complete the normal bandwidths of a 
few gigabytes per second to terabit every second. Besides, they misuse the direction 
and exchange of signals in the ﬁeld. 
Figure 2 gives the: rapid advancement of innovation, coupled with an inexplicable 
interest in data transmission, is bringing rapid progress of this communication from 
laboratories to commercial centers. The Optical Network (ON) ﬁber transmission 
is the well-covered perspective of systems such as broadcast vision and design and 
control and board issues of second-year ﬁber optic communication. Such a system 
would not end without showing the expected parts of building this communication, 
especially since the organization models rely heavily on them. Individuals planning 
optical communication should be aware of their potential system, therefore, attempts 
to cover systems administration issues with segments, transmissions and other optical 
bodies

A base station with a remote back hole ensures that ﬁber jumpers and cabling are 
being used somewhere in that organization. Having an overall understanding of ﬁber

Optical ﬁber is a dielectric waveguide or medium where data (sound, information or 
video) is sent as light through glass or plastic ﬁbers. The cladding supports the waveg-
uide structure, the center by retaining contaminants to the surface and, when thick 
enough, generously reduces radiation’s inconvenience in the surrounding air. The 
main elements of glass are usually less unfortunate in the examination of the central 
elements of plastic. Moreover, most strands are embedded in a ﬂexible, scraped area 
safe plastic material that precisely disintegrates the ﬁbers from minor mathematical 
anomalies and distortions. A set of guided electromagnetic waves, similarly called 
waveguide methods, can illustrate light’s propagation along a waveguide. Only a 
speciﬁc number of mods are equipped to spread through the waveguide.

Optical ﬁber is a dielectric waveguide or medium where data (sound, information

The cladding waveguide lowers the structure, scavenges the center from impurities 
covering the surface and, when thick enough, generously reduces the misfortune 
of radiation in the contained air. The main elements of glass are generally less 
unfortunate than the central elements of plastic. Moreover, most of the ﬁbers are 
exempliﬁed inﬂexible, scraped, safe plastic material that separates the strands from 
slight mathematical distortions and deformities. An algorithm technique is a set of 
guided electromagnetic waves, also called waveguide methods, that can illustrate 
light’s propagation along a waveguide.

Conclusion 
Optical Network (ON) supports a wide range of correspondence management, 
including private administration, administrative administration and multidisciplinary 
administration. Network communication of the mile to terminate the ﬁber optical 
correspondence network by accessing the center, metro and optical access organi-
zations. Imperative ﬁfth-age remote organization for new optical systems admin-
istration requirements such as high transfer speed, low latency, precise synchro-
nization, and network cutting ability. The Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing 
(DWDM) prerequisite for high transfer speeds is many data through remote appli-
cations. However, the requirements for low inactivity and precise synchronization 
are essentially determined by applying the Fiber Optic Communication (FBC) and 
Composed Multi- Point (CMP). The prerequisite for network cutting is directed 
towards increasing asset usage for some random application. Each of these require-
ments tends to be in the supposed aligned optical wired Network. The survey is 
planned to show the emotional mechanical progress in ﬁber transmission and systems 
administration in getting speed and give viewpoints.

Introduction 
This study began with a useful question on improving wireless sensor networks’ 
network life cycle using reinforcement learning enhanced power with sensor termi-
nals. The FCL-Boost algorithms to improve energy efﬁciency, problem-solving has 
been the main area of study in the various literature that has been discussed over 
the past few decades. Therefore, it is expected that the sensor nodes will improve 
and enable sleep and wake-up mechanisms to exploit their energy to improve the 
networks’ life cycle. 
In most cases, due to the multi-hop communication, it is a heavy load to the 
nearest base station as the senior center because they are centered in the middle of 
the base station and stay away and arrange the information sent to the remote sensor 
base station. The problem in this scenario is the problem area where the Sensor 
Node (SN) sends its information, such as different hub information near the center 
of the event tank. Of these contributions to the total pollution reduction worn by the 
remote sensor at the exhibition. Wireless Sensor Network Development and Problem 
Areas, Generally speaking, the head of the universal tank is required for each beam, 
information collection, and information transmission can’t afford to take a long time 
to cross a long lifespan and uses little middle. Therefore, suggest learning support 
and data weight calculations.

A wireless sensor is a small electronic device that can measure body level (such 
as temperature, light, pressure, etc.) and transmit it directly or through other sensor 
nodes to a set center that acts as a router. Given the advancements made in microelec-
tronics, wireless transfer technology and software make smaller scale sensors that 
can create a few cubic millimeters. It can work the module in the system at a sensible 
cost. The sensor hub incorporates four fundamental units of two altered hand-held

will learn how it is possible to induce the ability to portray the hidden structure of the

rate. The proposed technique [9] has four main steps: First, the K-means set is used 
to create different training subsets. Then, according to the training subcommittee 
obtained, different nerve ambiguity models were trained. Following that, a vector 
of SVM classiﬁcation is generated, and ﬁnally, the radius is made to determine 
whether SVM classiﬁcation inﬁltration has occurred or not. To illustrate this new 
method’s compatibility and efﬁciency, the results of the experimental ﬁle dataset 
were demonstrated. Experimental [10] results show that a new method is a really 
good blood pressure neurological network, multi-class SVM, and other well-known 
methods, such as the Columbia model based on the decision trees’ sensitivity and 
accuracy, especially the result.

value. The regulation in each area of information is implemented due [13, 21] to  
the Dumpster rule of combinations of these possible components. As a result, the 
ﬁrst two datasets’ order showed surprisingly high accuracy while other well-known 
strategies were not considered rigorous. The third set of data groups is non-digital 
and difﬁcult. Still, completed by giving the structure and quality capabilities a great 
result to get the [14] combination for a carefully structured and accurate character-
ization. In all cases, the DS sources strategy gives almost the same performance as 
other well-known calculations. Still, the quality of production accuracy gives cost 
processing and expansion of new features. In general, the [15, 22] results suggest 
that the gives a large-scale capacity structure and size to mechanize the compatibility 
of calculating the structure of a reasonable [16] construction system and complex 
order issues. In this way, the success of distinguishing interference under these condi-
tions, unfortunately, requires a signiﬁcant degree of accuracy and productivity with a 
preempted goal. Many interfering [17, 23] detection patterns in writing do not recom-
mend continuous responses to manage the barriers mentioned above. This experi-
ment and Denial of Service DoS encourages us to propose a lightweight interference 
recognition framework for attack locations. 
Even an isolated [18] occasional source (for example, transportation arrangement) 
thinks about it alone when facing big data challenges. Attempts to use more diverse 
information sources represent a challenge that deserves a lot of attention with big 
data. Innovative inﬁltration detection of bulk [19] data can lead to the realization of 
these large diversiﬁed data challenges. This article investigates the issue of diversiﬁed 
information, especially to the degree of big difference. This report is a precursor to 
an inﬁltration detection system. 
Details of possible attacks and [20–23] reactions were detected in the water at the 
beginning of a conversation about various components. In the long run, it will hint 
at the new concept of IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and possible dialog ways 
to improve the existing structure. 
In this option, up to two unique techniques, particularly FCLBoost.L1 and be 
FCLBoost.L2, F-score calculation for judgment in the light of implementation, high-
lighting grown and ready to collect the classiﬁcation can be upgraded. 1. It is done.

these lines, it is discharged from the production process to ensure that information can

to be considered. Are a mixture of three types of unique types of collections in the

Materials and Methods 
The proposed system to overcome the above problems efﬁciently. Recent detection 
minimizes show the Fig. 2 ﬁrst discriminatory algorithm (FCL-Boost) algorithm 
using detection. It is adding data to a user request that the L1 level does not have a 
one-time data response. The second level of information to users on a server in the 
data travels safely. The stream performed the activity in Fig. 2. Right off the bat, the 
records to be utilized in the examination were gathered. The highlights were chosen 
with the F-Class include choice calculation. At last, the information is arranged with 
various classiﬁers, and their exhibitions are determined. When these assignments 
are performed, the hardware has delegated a classiﬁcation and presentation that is 
resolved at all levels and positions.

of the carrier) 
Expanded the range close to zero, the system image and nearest neighbor classiﬁer 
start. (Self-esteem when you’re far away from 0, multiple vectors, each with different 
information, the classiﬁed into consideration gives birth order). The extension range 
is limited to 0.01 in advance. After examination, the nature of the outskirt and usage 
of the best execution framework has been resolved. Supported vector machines have 
better AI calculations. The Support vector machines try to isolate a straight line and 
a dotted line from a set of data. The basic error information in the (Support Vector 
Machine) SVM calculation and an option must be recognized. Solution analysis is 
used in the Gaussian or Extended Conditional Work Random Forest (RF) area (RF).

Result and Discussion 
The motivation behind this work is to build up another calculation to improve the 
general acknowledgment execution. The quicker, perform better execution, even 
though the calculation (FCL-support) presentation is comparable to the irregular 
interior framework with less exertion. Because of this strategy, there are two adap-
tations of the F-score include choice calculation (FCLBoost.L1 and FCLBoost.L2). 
(FCLBoost.L1 is broad recognition and development of a single taxonomy, Level 
2) and FCLBoost.V2 into at least three types (Level 1). (Developed according to 
the FCL-Boost algorithm, double-select the features of the dataset using the F-level

In this section, implement the main goal proposed system through the establishment 
and use of a parody of notiﬁcation of the application is Network security.NS2Network 
simulator. The name of the Foremost Classiﬁcation Level algorithm method (FCL-
Boost) is. According to this method, the selection and classiﬁcation of different 
classiﬁers or F level is the same assortment. The next step is to create a uniﬁed 
classiﬁcation. Two versions, FCLBoost.L1 (Level 1) and FCLBoost.L2 (Level 2), 
under the same or different classiﬁcations have been developed.As per the outcomes 
got, the outcomes are predictable with writing reports. 
FCLBoost.L1 and FCLBoost.L2 for exactness rate are the primary higher than 
FCL speeding up the calculation. FCLBoost.L1, 1-SVM joining strategy is the ideal 
way a higher position than the other upgrade calculations. The time has come to guar-

Conclusion 
The Foremost Classiﬁcation Level [FCL Boost] might be created that the best 
computing. The strategy is not much progress has been just that, this gives quickly, 
high- accuracy, high-exactness, and quick outcomes. An especially invaluable situ-
ating calculation is valuable in a variety of system security data. In this way, FCL-
acceleration might like it. FCL-Boost has lower, and steps accuracy ratio comparison 
is better and contains more than various computational calculations. Thinking about 
these attractions, FCL-acceleration may soon be the most frequently used calcu-
lation. FCL stimulus calculation is ideal for use as a symbol of clinical research 
in living, in-depth learning, and used consistently in computer communication. At 
least three classiﬁcations of FCL stimulus can be used. Also, FCL-Boost.L1 has an 
incentive level that can be used as an isolated classiﬁer for FCL. It is FCL-Boost. 
The L1-speciﬁc bit reaches the highest standalone classiﬁers. The F score shows 
the judgment calculation to make this favorable position. By adding different high-
lights, similar details can be deciphered in unexpected ways. Once the opportunity 
closed, the classiﬁcation performed in solid, FCL accelerated increments. Likewise, 
it is recommended to use powerful classiﬁers for calculations. Equipment classiﬁca-
tion often participates in the weak classiﬁcation to draw a solid classiﬁcation. The 
strong of FCL-Boost. This will say that FCL help is another approach to make a 
troupe arrangement. Improvement of the rate net presentation for FCL-Boost 85% 
compared to SVM, RF, and KNN method. Best Performance FCL-Boost Half on 
Data Security Broadcast System, KNN 55%, and Random Forest 60%. FCL-boost 
performance 50% better timing for accessing the main goal of the proposed system. A 
superior outﬁt classiﬁer can be made with an incredible classiﬁer, and the F-classiﬁer 
includes choice calculation.

Introduction 
Energy sources that naturally replenish themselves and do not run out over time 
are referred to as renewable energy sources. Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and 
biomass energy are some of these resources. Solar energy is produced by photovoltaic 
panels or concentrated solar power plants, which harness solar energy and turn it 
into electricity. By employing wind turbines to capture the wind’s energy, we can 
produce wind energy [1]. When the wind blows, the turbine’s blades rotate, driving 
a generator to generate power. Hydroelectric power is created by turning a turbine 
with the force of ﬂowing water, which then drives a generator to provide electricity. 
Dams, which hold water in reservoirs and release it through turbines, or smaller, 
decentralised hydroelectric systems, can be used to do this. Geothermal energy, 
which can be utilised to produce electricity or to heat and cool buildings, is created 
by capturing the heat from the Earth’s core. Burning organic resources, such as wood 
or agricultural waste, to create heat or power is known as biomass energy. Reducing 
our dependency on fossil fuels, which play a signiﬁcant role in climate change and 
air pollution, is one advantage that renewable energy sources provide. A sustainable 
choice for supplying the world’s expanding energy needs, renewable energy sources

also have the potential to offer a clean and limitless source of power. Fossil fuels, 
which are a major cause of climate change and air pollution, have received a lot 
of attention recently as viable alternatives to renewable energy. Renewable energy 
sources, including solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy, have the potential 
to provide a clean and limitless source of energy, making them a viable choice for 
supplying the world’s expanding energy needs [2]. The switch to renewable energy 
does not, however, come without difﬁculties. The expensive upfront costs of putting 
these technologies into practise are one of the key barriers to the widespread use 
of renewable energy. For instance, installing solar or wind energy systems demands 
a substantial ﬁnancial commitment, which may be prohibitive for private citizens, 
companies, or governments. Additionally, building new infrastructure for renewable 
energy sources, such as transmission lines and storage facilities, can be expensive 
and time-consuming. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on increasing 
the use of renewable energy in order to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy 
sources and mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Many countries and 
businesses have set ambitious goals to transition to renewable energy sources as part 
of their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and become more sustainable. 
1.1 
Energy Crisis and Renewable Energy Use 
The term “energy crisis,” frequently referred to as “the global energy dilemma,” is 
used to characterise the difﬁculties in addressing the world’s rising energy needs in 
a way that is sustainable and reasonably priced. Population expansion, economic 
progress, and an increase in the usage of energy-intensive technology are some of 
the causes that are causing the complicated problem known as the energy crisis. 
The usage of fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas, and oil, which are a signiﬁcant 
source of greenhouse gas emissions and are a contributing factor to climate change, 
is one of the key causes of the current energy crisis. Price volatility and supply 
interruptions have resulted from the rising energy demand and the constrained supply 
of fossil fuels, which can have a detrimental effect on the economy and society. 
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass, are 
naturally replenishing and do not deplete, unlike non-renewable energy sources such 
as fossil fuels. The increasing use of renewable energy has become a global priority 
due to concerns about climate change and air pollution, as well as the ﬁnite nature 
of non-renewable energy sources. In addition to individual efforts to transition to 
renewable energy, there has also been a push at the policy level to increase the use 
of renewable energy. Many countries and businesses have set ambitious goals to 
increase their use of renewable energy as part of their efforts to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and become more sustainable. Governments have also implemented 
policies and incentives, such as tax credits and subsidies, to encourage the adoption 
of renewable energy. Overall, renewable energy sources offer a sustainable and cost-
effective alternative to non-renewable energy sources, with numerous environmental 
and economic beneﬁts. While there are challenges to increasing the use of renewable

energy, the transition is becoming increasingly viable as technology improves and 
costs fall. Policy efforts at the national and international level are also helping to 
accelerate the transition to renewable energy [3].

Integration of Machine Learning 
Machine Learning can analyse the impact of integrating wind and solar power gener-
ation systems in Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan by collecting and processing 
data, assessing resource potential, forecasting power generation, evaluating grid 
integration and stability, optimizing energy management, assessing environmental 
impact, and providing decision support. By leveraging Machine Learning ‘s capa-
bilities in data analysis, and simulation, policymakers, energy planners, and stake-
holders can gain valuable insights to inform decisions, maximize renewable energy 
utilization, minimize costs, and promote sustainable development in these regions 
[27].

Renewable Energy Sources Distribution 
Conventional energy is the main source of electricity generation but it produces a 
large amount of carbon and harmful gases in the environment. These gases are the 
main concern now a day in the world which damages the greenhouse system of the 
environment and increase Global Warming. Renewable energy sources have great 
potential to fulﬁl our energy demand without pollution. This is only solution of Global 
Warming and pollution. Power generation from renewable sources is on the rise in 
India, with the share of renewable energy in the country’s total installed capacity 
rising from 7.8% in 2008 to around 13% in 2014 (IREDA 2014). India now has 
about 36.4 GW of installed renewable energy capacity. Of these, wind is the largest 
contributor and stands at around 23.7 GW of installed capacity making India the 
world’s ﬁfth largest wind energy producer. Small hydro power (4.1 GW), bio-energy 
(4.4 GW) and solar energy (4 GW) constitute the remaining capacity (MNRE 2015). 
It has been reported that in terms of electricity generation, approximately 70 billion 
units per year is being generated from renewable sources (MNRE 2014). Figure 1 
below shows the renewable energy mix in the total installed capacity in India. 
This diagram clearly states that 79% energy comes from coal and gas, only 5.6% 
energy generate from renewable energy source. So, there is vast scope of renewable 
energy in India. Solar and wind both systems depend on environment condition so 
that we cannot depend on only one system. For hybrid of energy system, there are 
many types of schemes such as series hybrid system, parallel hybrid system, switched 
hybrid system. They used MPPT techniques to maximize the power point from solar 
module. P&O algorithm is used to track maximum point. In this method voltage is 
periodically compare the perturbation with output power perturbation cycle. But this

method varies with varying atmosphere condition. Incremental Conductance method 
is used to overcome this drawback. The battery used for hybrid systems are lead acid 
battery, Nickel Cadmium battery. Others-Super conducting magnetic energy storage 
is used but it is expensive. Under trends heading, Hybrid renewable energy have 
great potential of research and development. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power 
are examples of renewable energy sources that have grown in importance recently 
as a way to lessen our dependency on fossil fuels and lessen the damaging effects 
of carbon emissions on the environment. In comparison to conventional fossil fuels, 
these sources are more plentiful, cheaper, and emissions-free. The broad use of 
renewable energy sources still faces obstacles, including logistical and technological 
ones as well as the requirement for cutting-edge storage options to deal with some of 
these sources’ sporadic nature. Despite these difﬁculties, it is certain that renewable 
energy will play a signiﬁcant role in our future energy mix, and work is being done 
to create more efﬁcient and affordable solutions [4].

Renewable Energy System 
Amer et al. [5], this paper focus on optimization of power of Hybrid Renewable 
Energy System. For minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LEC), Particle Swarm 
Optimization Technique (PSO) is used. The proposed algorithm minimizes the cost 
ﬁtness function of all sources of Renewable Energy. They achieve mainly two goals

PSO algorithm and optimize problem, with the constructed objective function to be 
used in choosing how many powers will be generated in HRES in this research. PSO 
appears in the core of it, searching to ﬁnd the optimum power generated. This routine 
is programmed under MATLAB software. Apply this algorithm they minimize LEC 
0.0030277 e/kW and the power generated from the wind turbine is 1.0185 kW, while 
the power generated from the PV module is 0.23153 kW [5].

controller. The overall system stability was studied and showed that the system is 
not of non-minimum phase type if the PV generator voltage is controlled [6]. 
Shezan et al. [7], this paper proposed wind and solar hybrid renewable energy

developed using MATLAB/ Simulink R2011b. This system is suitable for telecom 
equipment where constant voltage and continuous power is required. This system 
maintains the 48 V DC and three phase AC supply [7].

output voltage. In PV solar module, they used 18 solar cells are connected in series 
to get Voltage 36 V and current 4.6 A. They used irradiation G = 0.8 W/m2, wind  
speed 14 m/s and Load = 500 Ω in hybrid system. This system is useful of remote 
areas and simulated on MATLAB/SIMULINK [8]. 
Kumar et al. [9], this paper used Combined Modiﬁed Bat Search algorithm and 
artiﬁcial neural network control system (CMBSNN) for Hybrid Renewable Energy 
System (HRES). CMBSNN algorithm optimize the reactive power according to 
controller parameters. Bat algorithm increase searching behaviour and utilizing the 
smart mathematical function. It uses proportional integral (PI) controller which is 
reduce the system error. Artiﬁcial Neural Network is used to machine learning. They 
simulate the whole system on MATLAB Simulink and plot the graph with various 
parameters [9]. 
Phan and Lai [10], this paper represent the Hybrid Renewable energy system using 
Reinforcement Learning Approach (RLA) for microgrid. They used deep Q-learning 
method for power management control system. They proposed the modiﬁed HRES 
and give a block diagram. In block diagram they connect PV, Battery, Generator, 
fuel cell and Hydrogen tank with Ac/Dc Inverter. They selected location at BASCO 
Island in Philippines. At present it uses diesel generator system only. So, government 
want to introduce low-cost environment friendly system. The proposed system fulﬁls 
the all demand and criteria of Basco Island. They also give the environment data of 
Basco Island. They modiﬁed the MPPT system and combine the Q-learning and P&O

chart diagram is shown and explain. They plot the various graph of performance of 
system on different weather condition and compare with other systems. They also 
want to implement physically on Basco Island in future [10]. 
Kumar et al. [11], they published this paper on topic Design and analysis of Hybrid 
RBFN MPPT solar and wind energy system. They proposed a single MPPT topology 
for hybrid system and give in block diagram. They implement basic PV diode current, 
voltage and power equation and give the all-parameter rating of proposed system. 
They simulate the Simulink Model on MATLAB and integrated with 230 V, 50 Hz 
AC grid. They plot graph of output voltage, current and power of stand-alone system 
as well as gird connected system. All the results summarise in table under active 
power and reactive power column. They reduce the complexity of hybrid system 
successfully [11]. 
Habib et al. [12], they design a standalone hybrid renewable energy system for 
small town of Pakistan. They proposed the advance Power Management System 
(PMS) and design & simulate on MATLAB/Simulink software. Their model consists 
of wind generation system, Battery storage, Battery control unit, Inverter, Filter, 
Model predicative control Block and Load. They optimize the size of individual 
components, input the real data of particular place and get output and validate with 
conventional model results. This system is able to fulﬁl the demand of power supply 
of remote area of Pakistan with excess energy of 30%. TDH reduced to 0.26%. It 
saves the 76.7% cost with 100% clean energy [12]. 
Baumann et al. [13], they published the paper on the topic “Energy Flow Manage-
ment of hybrid renewable energy system”. They set up an experiment at Ostfalia, 
Germany. It consists of 5.1 k Wp PV-array, a 1 k Wp PV-array with tilt angle, a 4-kW 
micro wind turbine,  a 1.2  kW  fuel  cell system,  and a 6 kW micro-CHP  unit.  They  
give block diagram of whole system at laboratory which connected with LON and 
web server. It stores the all data into MySql Database and driven from MATLAB 
Simulink. They plot the graph of total electrical power of whole day and 2-h dura-
tion. They also give the ﬂow chart diagram of energy management algorithm. This 
system produces 164.03 Kwh but need 72 Kwh so it generates surplus power. They 
physically implemented the ﬁrst simple model successfully and going to implement 
bidirectional complex energy management system in future [13]. 
Saidi and Chellali [14], they published the paper on simulation and control hybrid 
renewable power. In introduction section described the components of hybrid system.

hybrid system. In proposed schematic diagram, wind energy and solar energy inte-
grated with ﬁrst and second input stages, output and storage circuit stages, Inverter 
and storage devices. The proposed four direction converter worked in 10 possible 
modes and given by wind (W), PV (P), storage (S) and Load (L) combination. 
All equivalent circuit of converter is represented. Simulate the equivalent circuit on 
Pspice and MATLAB with given parameters and output current and voltage graph is 
given as result [15]. 
Anoune et al. [16], they published their paper on topic Maximize the production 
of electrical power from Hybrid Renewable energy. They stated that alone PV or 
Wind energy system cannot fulﬁl the demand of local demand. So, hybridization of 
PV and wind is compulsory. It reduces the both disadvantages. The proposed a model 
consists of MPPT, DC/DC Boost converter and Lead acid battery as storage device. 
They simulate their proposed DC-DC boost converter model on Simulink and show 
the output voltage stable on 48 V DC. P&O method is used to tack maximum point 
of power. They have used PWM techniques for control the DC-DC boost converter. 
Overall model is stable and reliable [16]. 
Zahboune et al. [17], they optimize Hybrid Renewable energy source and Modiﬁed 
Electric System Cascade Analysis with the help of Homer software. Homer software 
used for design the best combination of renewable energy sources i.e., solar, wind, 
hydroelectricity, bio-diesel generator. They also used MESCA method where collect 
the monthly record of PV, wind and charging-discharging history of battery in table. 
In ﬁrst algorithm wind turbine and batteries number are calculated as FEE at T = 
288 h but second algorithm sizing correction at T = 8760 h. The homer result is 
given as graph of electrical and leaking energy. They also compared the Homer pro 
and MESCA method and tables & graphs are showed. In future, MESCA method 
can be applied on green energy and storage system [17]. 
Mokhtara et al. [18], they focused on supply demand management of Hybrid 
renewable energy systems for residential area. They used PSO algorithm to reduced 
building energy consumption. In this paper, they described system modelling and 
conﬁguration of HRES. For this modelling, they draw a schematic diagram of HRES 
System and estimate the average residential load. They calculate the supply power 
of PV energy, wind energy and diesel generator and demand from household equip-
ment of each room of house. After simulation of proposed model on MATLAB And 
HOMER software, they ﬁnd out results and compared to each other for validation 
and discussed [18].

Hybrid Renewable Energy System for Different 
Geographical Condition 
A hybrid renewable energy system combines multiple sources of renewable energy to 
provide a reliable and efﬁcient energy supply. The speciﬁc components of the system 
will depend on the geographical conditions and energy demands of the location. For

288
H. Giroh et al.
example, in areas with strong wind and solar resources, a hybrid system may include 
wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) panels. In regions with more consistent hydro 
resources, a system may include hydro power and wind or solar. The system can also 
be designed to incorporate energy storage options, such as batteries, to smooth out 
ﬂuctuations in renewable energy production. The goal of a hybrid renewable energy 
system is to maximize the use of locally available renewable resources, reduce depen-
dence on fossil fuels, and provide a cost-effective and sustainable energy solution 
[19]. 
4.1 
Status of Hybrid System Power Generation System 
for Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan 
Wind and solar power generation systems would be well-suited for the states of 
Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan. These states have abundant sunlight and wind 
resources, making them ideal for the deployment of photovoltaic (PV) panels and 
wind turbines [20]. For Uttarakhand, a hybrid system incorporating wind and solar 
would be ideal, as the state has a good wind energy potential in some areas and good 
solar potential in others. Wind turbines could be deployed in areas with strong wind 
resources, while PV panels could be installed in areas with high solar insolation. 
In Haryana, a similar hybrid system could be deployed, but with a greater emphasis 
on solar power. Haryana is known for its high solar insolation, making it a prime 
location for the deployment of large-scale PV panels. In Rajasthan, a wind-solar 
hybrid system could also be deployed, taking advantage of the strong wind resources 
in some areas and the high solar insolation in others. In this state, wind turbines could 
be deployed in areas with high wind speeds, while PV panels could be installed in 
areas with high solar insolation. In all cases, energy storage systems, such as batteries, 
could be incorporated into the hybrid systems to ensure that energy is available even 
when renewable energy production is low. This would help to provide a more stable 
and reliable energy supply for the region [21]. 
4.2 
Analyse the Wind and Solar Power Generation System 
for Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan 
The analysis of wind and solar power generation systems in Uttarakhand, Haryana, 
and Rajasthan would consider the following factors:
• Renewable energy resources: The ﬁrst step is to assess the wind and solar 
resources in each state. This can be done using wind and solar data from meteo-
rological stations [22], satellite imagery, and numerical models. The data can be 
used to determine the wind speeds, solar insolation, and other relevant parameters 
[11].

• Energy demand: The energy demand of each state must be estimated to determine 
the scale of the renewable energy system required. This includes the electricity 
demand of households, businesses, and industries in each state [23].
• Techno-economic feasibility: The cost of installing and operating wind and solar 
power generation systems must be evaluated. This includes the cost of the wind 
turbines or PV panels, the cost of energy storage systems, and the operational and 
maintenance costs [24].
• Grid integration: The renewable energy system must be integrated into the 
existing grid infrastructure. This involves ensuring that the energy produced by 
the wind and solar systems can be delivered to the grid and consumed by end-users 
[25].
• Environmental impact: The environmental impact of the wind and solar power 
generation systems must be evaluated. This includes the impact of the wind 
turbines or PV panels on the local ecology and wildlife, as well as the impact 
of the energy production and transmission processes [26]. 
Based on the results of this analysis, a wind and solar power generation system 
can be designed and deployed in each state to meet the energy demands of the region 
while taking into account the local conditions, resources, and constraints (Table 1). 
The above reﬂect the actual wind and solar energy conditions in each state. The 
data may vary based on the speciﬁc location and the time of year.

Scope of Research and Adoptability of Machine Learning 
Regional studies of solar and other renewable energy resource have been widely 
covered in many research. The regional context helps to industry to plan and imple-
ment their set up with consideration of the underlying research. In our research we 
also initiated with demography analysis and adaptability of renewable energy. Beside 
the Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan together in context of hybrid renewable 
energy has been still untouched and open research. This analysis gives the adapt-
ability of alternative energy in norther region of India. The scope of research on the 
integration of wind and solar power generation systems in Uttarakhand, Haryana, 
and Rajasthan using machine learning (ML) techniques is broad and promising. ML 
algorithms can be applied to various aspects of this integration, including resource 
assessment, power generation forecasting, grid stability analysis, energy manage-
ment optimization, and environmental impact assessment. ML can help in assessing

290
H. Giroh et al.
the potential of wind and solar resources by analysing historical weather patterns, 
topography, and other relevant data. It can accurately forecast power generation by 
considering real-time weather data, historical generation patterns, and other vari-
ables. ML models can simulate and analyze the impact of integrating renewable 
energy sources into the existing grid infrastructure, ensuring stability and relia-
bility. The adoptability of machine learning in this research is high. ML techniques 
have been successfully employed in various domains and have proven effective in 
analyzing complex and large datasets. With the availability of historical data, real-
time monitoring systems, and advancements in ML algorithms, the integration of 
wind and solar power generation systems can beneﬁt greatly from ML’s ability to 
analyze, predict, and optimize various aspects of the system [28].

Conclusion and Future Scope 
The wind and solar energy have great potential in Uttarakhand, Haryana, and 
Rajasthan. These states are blessed with abundant wind and solar resources, making 
them ideal locations for the development of renewable energy. With the right policy 
framework and investment, wind and solar energy can play a signiﬁcant role in 
meeting the energy demands of these states and reducing the dependence on conven-
tional energy sources. There is a huge scope for the future growth of wind and 
solar energy in these states. The government and private sector can work together to 
improve infrastructure and grid connectivity, attract investment, and create job oppor-
tunities in the renewable energy sector. Additionally, advances in technology and the 
falling cost of renewable energy systems will also help to increase the adoption of 
wind and solar energy in these states. In conclusion, wind and solar energy hold great 
promise for Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan and the future looks bright for the 
renewable energy sector in these states. Future the integration of wind and solar 
power generation systems in Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Rajasthan can beneﬁt from 
the application of machine learning (ML) techniques. ML algorithms could effec-
tively analyse data related to resource potential, power generation forecasting, grid 
integration, energy management optimization, and environmental impact assessment. 
The insights generated through ML-based analysis provide valuable information for 
policymakers and stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making and supporting 
the transition towards sustainable and clean energy sources. By leveraging the capa-
bilities of machine learning, we can accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and 
contribute to a greener and more resilient energy infrastructure in these regions.

Introduction 
A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. It contains a 
processor, memory, and input/output peripherals [1]. The 8051 microcontroller is a 
widely used microcontroller in embedded systems. It was introduced in the 1980s 
by Intel and has since been used in various applications such as automotive, indus-
trial, and consumer electronics [2]. VHDL is a hardware description language that 
allows for the creation of digital circuits and systems. The objective of this research 
paper is to implement an 8051-microcontroller using VHDL. The implementation 
will include the design of the processor, memory, and input/output peripherals. The 
implementation of 8051 microcontroller using VHDL will allow for the creation of 
customized microcontrollers with speciﬁc functionalities [3].

Background 
The 8051 microcontroller is a popular 8-bit microcontroller architecture that has been 
widely used in various applications since its introduction in 1980 [4]. Its simplicity, 
low cost, and ease of use have made it a popular choice for many embedded systems. 
VHDL is a hardware description language used for designing digital circuits and 
systems. It is often used to design and simulate digital circuits before implementation 
on an FPGA or ASIC [5]. Implementing the 8051-microcontroller using VHDL 
involves designing a digital circuit that can perform the same functions as the physical 
8051 microcontroller. The VHDL design must include the CPU, memory, I/O ports,

timers, and other peripherals found on the physical 8051 microcontroller [6]. The 
VHDL design should also include a way to interface with external devices such as 
sensors, actuators, and communication interfaces. The VHDL design of the 8051 
microcontrollers can be done using different design methodologies such as a top-
down approach or a bottom-up approach. In a top-down approach, the designer 
starts by deﬁning the system requirements and then develops a high-level description 
of the system. The high-level description is then reﬁned to a lower level until the 
ﬁnal implementation is reached. In a bottom-up approach, the designer starts by 
developing individual components and then integrates them into the ﬁnal design. 
The 8051 microcontroller is a popular 8-bit microcontroller that was ﬁrst introduced 
by Intel in 1980. It is widely used in various applications, such as automotive systems, 
industrial automation, and consumer electronics. VHDL is a hardware description 
language used to model digital circuits and systems. The combination of the 8051 
microcontrollers with VHDL can lead to powerful and efﬁcient systems [7]. 
The implementation of the 8051 microcontrollers with VHDL involves creating a 
hardware description of the microcontroller in VHDL. This is done by specifying the 
various components of the microcontroller, such as the registers, ALU, and instruc-
tion decoder, in VHDL code. The VHDL code is then synthesized to generate a netlist, 
which is a description of the circuit in terms of gates and ﬂip-ﬂops. The VHDL code 
for the 8051 microcontrollers can be developed using various tools, such as Xilinx ISE 
[8]. These tools provide a graphical user interface that allows designers to create and 
edit the VHDL code, simulate the design, and synthesize the netlist. Once the netlist is 
generated, it can be programmed onto a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an 
application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC). The FPGA or ASIC will then function 
as the 8051 microcontrollers, executing the instructions speciﬁed in the VHDL code. 
The beneﬁts of implementing the 8051 microcontrollers with VHDL are numerous. 
First, VHDL allows for easy simulation and veriﬁcation of the microcontroller design, 
which helps in identifying and correcting errors before the design is implemented 
in hardware. Second, VHDL enables the integration of the 8051 microcontrollers 
with other digital systems, such as communication interfaces and peripheral devices. 
Finally, VHDL facilitates the development of complex systems that require the 8051 
microcontrollers to interface with various digital systems (Fig. 1).

Proposed Architecture and Methodology 
CPU Module 
The CPU module of the 8051 microcontroller is responsible for executing the instruc-
tion and control the overall operation. The VHDL code for the CPU module includes 
the ALU, register ﬁle, program counter, and control unit. The ALU performs arith-
metic and logical operations, while the register ﬁle stores the data and addresses. 
The program counter stores the address of the next instruction to be executed, and 
the control unit generates the control signals to execute the instruction [9].

Memory Module 
The memory module of the 8051 microcontroller consists of program memory 
(ROM) and data memory (RAM). The program memory stores the program code 
and is non-volatile, while the data memory stores the data and is volatile. The VHDL 
code for the memory module includes the ROM, RAM, and memory interface. The 
memory interface provides the data and address signals to access the memory [10]. 
I/O Ports Module 
Input/output (I/O) ports: The 8051 microcontroller has four 8-bit I/O ports (P0, P1, 
P2, and P3) that can be used to interface with external devices. These ports can be 
conﬁgured as inputs or outputs depending on the application. The VHDL code for 
the I/O ports module includes the input/output buffers, latch, and control logic [11]. 
Timers Module 
The 8051 microcontroller has two 16-bit timers/counters (T0 and T1) that can be 
used for a variety of tasks, including timing events and counting external events. 
The VHDL code for the timers module includes the timer/counter, control logic, and 
interrupt generator [12]. 
Interrupts Module 
The 8051 microcontroller has ﬁve interrupt sources that can be used to interrupt 
the normal program ﬂow and perform a speciﬁc task. These include two external

interrupts (INT0 and INT1), two timer interrupts (T0 and T1), and a serial port 
interrupt (RI/TI). The VHDL code for the interrupts module includes the interrupt 
controller and priority encoder [12].

Implementation and Result 
Designing and implementing the VLSI implementation of the 8051 microcontrollers 
with VHDL involves several steps. The process can be broadly divided into two 
stages: designing the microcontroller architecture in VHDL and implementing the 
design on an FPGA. 
Designing the Microcontroller Architecture in VHDL: 
Requirement Analysis: The ﬁrst step in designing the microcontroller architec-
ture is to identify the requirements of the system. This involves determining the 
input and output requirements, memory requirements, and the instruction set of the 
microcontroller. 
Design Speciﬁcation: Based on the requirements, the design speciﬁcation of the 
microcontroller is created. This speciﬁcation includes the functional blocks, such 
as the instruction decoder, register bank, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and interrupt 
controller as shown in Fig. 2. 
VHDL Coding: In this part, 8051 microcontroller architecture is coded in VHDL. 
This involves writing VHDL code for the individual functional blocks and integrating 
them to create the complete microcontroller design as shown in Fig. 3.

to connect all the peripheral module ALU, RAM, ROM etc. all other module is used 
behavioural modelling to implement ALU, RAM, ROM, control unit, timers and

Simulation: Once the VHDL code is written, we are using ISE simulator to verify 
its correctness and functionality. The simulation results are then analysed and any 
necessary changes are made to the VHDL code as shown in Fig. 4.

priate device family and device for our project. Add the programming ﬁle (.bit) 
to ouriMPACT project. Selecting “Add File” from the “Project” menu, and then 
selecting the bit ﬁle. Connect your programming cable to the target FPGA device 
and computer. Conﬁgure the programming properties in iMPACT. This includes 
selecting the programming cable, the target device, and the programming ﬁle (.bit). 
Click the “Program” button in iMPACT to program our target device with the.bit 
ﬁle. Verify that the programming was successful by testing our FPGA device and 
checking that it behaves as expected.

Corrective Measure Using AI in VLSI Implementation 
of an 8051-Microcontroller 
In the VLSI implementation of an 8051-microcontroller using VHDL, AI can be 
utilized to provide re-correction measures during the design and implementation 
process. Below how AI can be applied at different stages to enhance the design: 
Design Optimization: AI algorithms, such as genetic algorithms [14–18] or rein-
forcement learning, can optimize the microcontroller’s design parameters. By iter-
ating through multiple design variations and evaluating their performance, AI can 
identify areas where improvements can be made. This could include optimizing 
component placement, routing, or logic design to achieve better performance, power 
consumption, or area utilization. 
Bug Detection and Correction: AI-based static analysis or formal veriﬁcation tech-
niques can help detect potential design bugs or ﬂaws. These algorithms can analyze 
the VHDL code, identify common coding errors or design violations, and suggest 
corrective measures. This can help eliminate design issues before they manifest into 
more signiﬁcant problems during the implementation phase. 
Performance Prediction and Analysis: AI models can be trained on large datasets 
of VHDL designs and their corresponding performance metrics. By analyzing the 
microcontroller’s VHDL code and input/output patterns, AI models can predict 
performance metrics such as power consumption, timing, or area utilization. These 
predictions can assist in identifying potential bottlenecks or areas of improvement, 
allowing designers to make informed decisions during the design process.

301
Intelligent Place and Route: AI algorithms can be used to optimize the placement 
and routing of the microcontroller’s components on the chip. By considering factors 
like signal integrity, wirelength, and performance goals, AI-based place and route 
techniques can suggest improved placement and routing strategies. This can lead to 
reduced signal delays, improved timing closure, and better overall performance. 
Automated Testing and Debugging: AI can be used to automate the generation of 
test stimuli and the analysis of simulation results. By leveraging machine learning 
or symbolic reasoning techniques, AI algorithms can generate comprehensive test 
scenarios, identify critical paths, and detect potential functional or timing issues. This 
automated testing process can help accelerate the veriﬁcation process and improve 
the reliability of the microcontroller design. 
Adaptive Optimization: AI algorithms can continuously monitor the performance 
of the implemented microcontroller and dynamically optimize its operation. By 
analysing runtime data and considering varying environmental conditions, AI can 
adapt the microcontroller’s conﬁguration or operating parameters to maximize 
performance, minimize power consumption, or improve reliability [19, 20].

Introduction 
VANET features are most comparable to those of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) 
[3, 4], which shows that both types of networks are self-organizing and self-
managing, have low bandwidth, and remain in the same area while sharing radio 
transmission. As a result of the greater speed and mobility of VANET nodes in 
comparison to MANETs, the most signiﬁcant operational challenge for VANETs is 
the requirement for improved MANET structure in order to keep up with the quick 
mobility of VANET nodes. This is the case because VANET nodes move more quickly 
than MANET nodes. This, in turn, needs better routing protocol design. Developing 
routing protocols that can handle vehicle ad hoc networks, which host a wide range 
of applications including security and welfare in intelligent transportation systems, 
has long been a challenge for researchers (ITS). 
However, the VANET has numerous qualities that distinguish it from the MANET, 
such as its high mobility, which is a feature that is unique to the VANET. There is 
no energy shortage for the cars in the VANET, but their mobility brings with it a 
host of new problems. Vehicles on the road are becoming increasingly scalable, 
making this issue more important. As a result of the enormous volume of messages 
sent between the vehicles involved in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, VANET 
suffers from signiﬁcant packet loss. Some of the difﬁculties “VANET encounters 
include hidden terminals, long transmission delays for safety messages, broadcast 
storms, message security etc.”. A hierarchical organizational structure can be used 
to overcome these challenges. This occurs in hierarchical systems when two or more

cars with a shared characteristic create a cluster. Clustering is a common tool in data 
mining and machine learning. Mobile nodes in MANET, the forerunner to VANET, 
are similarly grouped for better performance. In a clustered vehicular environment, 
there are many smaller networks or clusters inside a larger network of cars.

Clustering was the most effective method that could arrange the functions of the 
system in a well-organized way. This strategy was used to create scalability in the 
network, minimize the amount of energy that was used, and produce a long lasting 
network lifespan. It is a well-known optimization issue that energy-efﬁcient clus-
tering has been generally recognized as playing a signiﬁcant role in extending the 
lifespan of VANETs. This role has been extensively performed. The end purpose of 
clustering was to provide a clariﬁcation that maintains stability among the sensors 
in each and every network function. 
2.1 
Energy Efﬁcient Clustering Methods 
Liu et al. [1] clustering and probabilistic broadcasting was the term given to the 
data transmission technique that was developed (CPB). The grouping was accom-
plished by clustering the automobiles according to the direction they were travelling 
in and their position. In this scenario, each vehicle makes its own judgment on the 
selection of CH in a distributed way; hence, the clustering management overhead 
is decreased as a result of this decision. Ahmad and Michel et al. [2], has put in 
place a clustering process known as Fan-Shaped Clustering (FSC). In terms of efﬁ-
ciency, this was a technique that used little power. VANETs favored this clustering-
based protocol over all others. This protocol used fan-shaped clusters to organize 
the whole network. All of these contributed to the network’s overall performance. 
Energy conservation and packet collection rates were shown to be superior in FSC to 
HEED in comparison to the HEED in the comparison results. Singh et al. [3], it has 
been demonstrated that clustering strategies for VANETs can be achieved through 
the use of a Genetic Algorithm-based approach. The clustering process was carried 
out taking into account both the amount of energy that was still present in the gate-
ways and the distance that separated them from the sensor nodes. Singh et al. [4] 
Using type-2 fuzzy logic, we have developed a VANET algorithm. Interval type-2 
FL model-based clustering is projected to perform better than Type-1 Fuzzy Logic 
(T1FL) model in cases of unclear decision levels. “The total number of levels in 
the sensor network was determined. Palvinder et al. [5] In VANETs, a clustering 
method based on LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) has been 
explained. It was found that this strategy might increase the network’s stability

and extend its lifespan through detailed simulations of the wireless sensors envi-
ronment. In both dynamic and static networks, the “Orphan Nodes-Low Energy 
Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (O-LEACH)” can be used. In order to reduce energy 
consumption, the LEACH approach was used. Vidhya and Sakthivel [6], Numerous 
use cases include the deployment of WSNs. “Once installed, sensor nodes might 
be difﬁcult to charge because they are often located in difﬁcult to access areas and 
WSN nodes are power constrained. An energy-saving routing approach is presented 
in conjunction with clusters in this article. Based on the LEACH algorithm, they 
provide an enhanced hierarchical routing chain-based clustering (EHRCC) tech-
nique. LEACH-1R PEGASIS (also known as E-LEACH) is a key component of the 
EHRCC algorithm”. Paola G. Vinueza et al. [7] have described a protocol for clus-
tering in virtual private networks (VANETs). When it comes to multi-hop wireless 
sensor networks, the protocol known as the “Energy Aware Distributed Unequal Clus-
tering” (EADUC) protocol was employed. This strategy was successful in resolving 
the entire energy problem. The residual energy and the location of the base station 
were given signiﬁcant weight as clustering characteristics in this study. Srinivasa et al.

(nCRO) for "energy-efﬁcient CH selection and cluster formation."

Machine Learning Based Energy Efﬁcient 
The machine learning played a signiﬁcant role in society. Machine Learning algo-
rithms can be used for minimizing energy consumption. It primarily helps the system 
to manage itself. VANETs have been implemented in several industrial applications, 
where consistency and network presentation were signiﬁcant achievement factors. 
Some machine learning methods were as follows, 
Marappan et al. [9], For WSN data collecting, this study presents a “Cross Layer-
Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy” (CL-LEACH) technique. This approach 
offers the energy usage of each network node, rather than the overall network, in order 
to enhance network longevity.

Proposed Energy Consumption Model and K-means 
Clustering Algorithms 
There is a transmitter and receiver in a VANET’s communication channel. The 
sensor node’s energy is used to power the ampliﬁer circuit and ampliﬁer circuit of 
the transmitter device. By radio electronics, the receiver can spend energy while 
receiving packets across long distances. During the communication period, the 
distance between the communication entities is compared to the threshold distance.

In this case, free space energy consumption is taken into account while performing 
the energy expenditure computation and the multipath design is employed otherwise. 
In light of this, the cluster head to sink node communication for data aggregation 
characteristics has been developed. The Eq. (1) can be used to calculate the amount 
of energy expended, which includes the distance d and the length L.

where, normal e Superscript upper F upper S can be used to describe the amount of money spent on transmitter ampli-
fying expenses when the model is in free space, normal e Superscript upper T upper X This is the amount of energy 
expended to send one packet of data over a distance of L meters. The power consump-
tion of the transmitter and receiver is mostly determined by the use of digital modula-
tion and coding. normal e Superscript upper E l upper E To operate single bits of data, an electrical circuit must expend 
energy in order to receive or transfer them. 
The power ampliﬁer consumes electricity depending on the distance between the 
sender and receiver during communication (Wu et al., 2019). If the communication 
distance D is smaller than the D0 parameter, then the distance is considered to be short. 
The free space power loss model can then be evaluated when the energy calculation 
has been completed. Multipath mode can be considered for energy consumption if 
the distance is greater than the reference distance, as shown in the equation below, 
normal e  Su perscrip t upper T u p per
 X Baseline left parenthesis normal upper L comma normal upper D right parenthesis equals upper L e Superscript upper E l upper E Baseline plus upper L e Superscript upper M upper P Baseline normal upper D Superscript 4 Baseline normal upper D much less than normal upper D Superscript normal upper O
where, normal e Superscript upper M upper P can be stated as the amount of money spent on transmitter ampliﬁers 
during multipath conditions. The following graph displays the energy usage from 
the receiving end,

where, normal e Superscript upper R upper X up to the energy consumed to receive packet data at length L and L is 
deﬁned as the number of bits in communication for data packet length.

This section provides an overview of the energy consumption of the free space 
model and the multipath model. Sensor node operation must provide electricity for 
the transmitter and receiver. The K-means clustering approach helps reduce power 
consumption. The next section explains the K-means clustering method.

Process of K-Means Clustering 
The primary goal of the proposed K-means energy efﬁcient clustering is to reduce 
energy usage while still supporting scalability, allowing for the possibility of 
choosing a cluster head in close proximity, and reducing internal overheads. The 
selection of cluster nodes is a critical component in the clustering process because 
it ensures that cluster members may connect with the sink node in a fair manner 
without placing an undue burden on other nodes. The selection of the cluster head 
should be made via a run-time variable. 
At the end of each cycle, full nodes are updated to reﬂect the current state of the 
cluster head parameter in respect to the sink node. The K-means clustering method 
is used to produce optimally sized groups of clusters. The optimal packet size can 
be thought of as a decision variable for selecting the cluster head in a cluster of 
clusters of clusters. Knowing that longer packets can be introduced with greater loss 
ratings while small packets can be subjected to higher overload conditions is already 
a known fact. 
Furthermore, the ﬂuctuation in packet size in networks of resource restrictions and 
autonomous constraints, which were not selected due to the increase in administration 
costs and additional overheads, has been observed. As a result, the appropriate packet 
size in this proposed methodology has been carefully considered in order to reduce 
the energy consumption of the WSN while simultaneously increasing the lifetime of 
the sensor nodes. 
The suggested K-means clustering algorithm can be implemented in three stages. 
Phase 1: Initialization 
The sensor nodes in the network ﬁeld receive the broadcast message as an initial-
ization request (IRQ) from the sink node at the start of the network ﬁeld. The reply 
message to the sink node should be provided by the surviving node, which is referred 
to as the initialization reply message by the IETF (IRP). The IRP message also 
contains information about the nodes, such as the location of the sensors and the 
amount of energy consumed by the devices. 
Phase 2: Formation of Cluster 
In this phase, K-means clustering is used to formation of clusters; it can be simplest 
unsupervised learning methods. The clustering algorithm splitting dataset into K 
number of clusters in addition k value can be computed based on the Eq. (5). The 
K means clustering have more inter cluster in addition intra cluster similarity. The 
clusters have different process which are presented as follows, 
Step 1: Calculation of K Value 
Computation of the k value presented in the below equation,

where, upper X upper S upper N squared can be “referred as the normal distance of all sensor nodes to the sink 
node, normal upper F can be described as the dimension of the created network structure and normal n can 
be referred as the sensor nodes in the network structure. The k value only selected 
the number of clusters in the network structure”. 
Step 2: Computation of Distance 
Here, “Euclidean distance can be utilized to compute the distance among the sensor 
nodes to each of the cluster centers. The Euclidean distance should assign each point 
to the closest center. The Euclidean distance presented below equation”,

as the coordinate of sensor node normal a in addition normal upper X Superscript upper C upper C can be described as the distance 
of node to cluster center. 
Step 3: Computation of New Cluster Center 
The calculation of the mean values in each cluster results in the creation of a 
new cluster center in each of the cluster groups’ sensor nodes that are completely 
connected. 
Step 4: Termination Condition 
Following the computation of the new centers in the different clusters, the step 2 can 
be carried out using the newly computed centers in each cluster. If the sensor nodes 
for cluster formation vary, then step 3 should be completed; otherwise, the method 
should be terminated. 
Phase 3: Selection of Cluster Head 
When using k means clustering, the selection of the cluster head is a critical step 
in the cluster building process. Clusters are generated as a result of the two phases 
that have gone before. Following that, a cluster head might be selected from among 
the clusters during this phase. The cluster head can be chosen depending on the two 
separate weight functions that have been deﬁned,

Conclusion 
This is the MANET area that is currently in the process of being developed. IT’s is one 
of the most demanding applications on the VANET, and it is widely regarded as the 
most effective method of implementing IT’s on the VANET. Because of the reduced 
travel time, VANET encourages people to be healthier, more tranquil, and more joyful 
in their lives. We have discussed VANETs in basic terms, including their uses and 
characteristics, in this review paper, and we have addressed the important research 
concerns that must be considered in the creation of cost-effective VANET protocols 
and applications (IT’s). Other difﬁculties must be considered, but the general view

is that vehicles will soon be able to beneﬁt from spontaneous wireless connections, 
which will enable VANETs to become a reality. In this paper we study various 
conventional and machine learning algorithms for VANET’s also we analysis the 
K-mean clustering algorithms for energy efﬁcient routing and cluster head selection.

Dandelion Algorithm for Optimal 
Location and Sizing of Battery Energy 
Storage Systems in Electrical 
Distribution Networks

1 Introduction 
In recent times, the problem of energy storage system (ESS) allocation in electrical 
distribution networks (EDNs) has received high attention for achieving energy equi-
librium, autonomous microgrid (MG) operation, handling various operational and 
controlling issues, and reliability improvement [1]. In [2], superconducting magnetic 
energy storage (SMES) is combined with model predictive control and the PV system 
to provide reactive power support and improve the stability of the utility’s voltage. In 
[3, 4], a bi-level optimization approach is suggested for sizing the ESS, including its 
reactive power support, to deal with high RE uncertainty and penetration. In the outer 
optimization, life cycle cost (LCC) is taken into account, and in the inner optimiza-
tion, voltage proﬁle and loss are taken into account. In [5], hybrid RE systems with 
PV and WT are set up so that they work best both on and off the grid. Loss of load and 
emission costs are optimized by using spotted hyena optimization (SHO) and particle 
swarm optimization (PSO) while designing the ESS. In [6], voltage ﬂuctuation and 
capacity of ESS are optimized in the distribution system by using multi-objective 
inertia control PSO for moderating the power exchanges between variable PV power 
and loading conditions. In [7], the uncertainty of PV, WT, and load is mitigated via 
the optimal design of the ESS, considering reduction of energy loss and enhance-
ment of voltage stability using the rider optimization algorithm (ROA). In [8], the 
problem of ESS allocation is solved using MINP and optimized using PSO. The cost

of energy not supplied (ENS) and the total cost of ESS are considered when formu-
lating a multi-objective function. In [9, 10], teaching–learning-based optimization 
(TLBO) is used to determine the best number of locations and their sizes, as well 
as the ﬁnancial elements of ESS (including energy not delivered, investment cost, 
and operating cost) and their impact on active power distribution losses and depend-
ability. In [11], a multi-objective ESS allocation problem by the non-dominated 
sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is solved to maximize reliability, speciﬁcally 
the momentary average interruption frequency index (MAIFI) and system average 
interruption frequency index (SAIDI), as well as equipment cost. For managing 
uncertainties with wind turbines (WT) and fuel cells (FC) in microgrid operations 
while taking the risk of downstream failures into consideration, an improved grey 
wolf optimization (GWO) is presented in [8]. In [12], modiﬁed manta ray foraging 
optimizer (MMRFO) is employed for sizing the ESS for different combinations of 
PV and WTs in the EDNs, considering their uncertainties. In [10], coyote optimiza-
tion algorithm (COA) is used for solving BES in an islanding network considering 
EV load penetration. Further, a comprehensive review on different state-of-the-art 
optimization studies on ESS allocation can be found in [13]. In light of the above 
works, this paper introduces a new optimization approach based on Dandelion Algo-
rithm (DA) [14] for optimizing the performance of EDN via optimally integrating 
distributed battery energy storage systems (BESSs). At ﬁrst, the search space for 
BESs locations is predetermined using loss sensitivity factors (LSFs) and later, DA 
is utilized for deducing the optimal locations along with sizes. Real power distribu-
tion loss reduction is considered as major objective function and the impact of BESs 
is further extended to analyze the network voltage proﬁle, voltage stability and GHG 
emission. For calculating the computational effectiveness of the suggested method-
ology, IEEE 33-bus RDN is used. The ﬁndings produced demonstrate DA’s efﬁcacy 
in comparison to other heuristic algorithms. Additionally, the results show that the 
proposed DA signiﬁcantly improves all techno-economic-environmental factors and 
improves RDN performance. 
2 Battery Energy Storage System 
The basic objective of BES system in this research is to handle sporadic nature of RE 
generation and the random network loading proﬁle. In the event of excessive genera-
tion, the BES system can store that excessive generation in charging mode, or at times 
of deﬁcit power generation by the RE source, it acts like another dispatchable power 
source by discharging its storage energy. Thus, the BES system capacity needs to 
be optimized considering autonomous or islanding modes. Following mathematical 
model is employed for designing BES capacity [10].

4 Dandelion Algorithm 
The ground is divided into two groups, according to the dandelion algorithm (DA) 
[15]: those that are best for dandelion sowing and those that are not. The core dande-
lion (CD) is the dandelion that grows in an advantageous environment, and assistance 
dandelions are those that do not (AD). When a dandelion is sown, its seeds are scat-
tered all over the surrounding area. The dandelion-sowing process in DA can be 
shown to look for an optimal in a particular region close to a point. Besides CD and 
AD, different dandelions sow differently. Mutant sowing prevents settling into the

local optimum. The selection mechanism chooses dandelions for the next generation. 
The dandelion algorithm includes normal, mutant sowing, and selection strategies. 
4.1 
Normal Sowing 
The CD produces more seeds than the AD because its soil is more conducive to seed 
development. The sowing yield depends on the ﬁtness of the dandelion population. A 
low-ﬁtness dandelion sows more seeds, whereas a high-ﬁtness one sows fewer seeds. 
However, neither dandelion will sow fewer seeds than the least possible number of 
seeds, as determined by,

where nsmax and nsmin are the maximum and minimum number of seeds, respectively; 
f max = max((di)) and f min = min((di)), ε is machine epsilon to avoid a 0 denominator, 
n s Subscript i is the number of seeds, d Subscript i represents ith dandelion. 
As mentioned earlier, dandelions are separated into two types as AD and CD. The 
CD is the highest ﬁtness dandelion, determined by subtracting the ﬁtness of the ADs 
from the ﬁtness of the CD.

The radius of the ADs and the central dandelions are calculated differently. The

where k is the number of current iteration, ub and lb are the upper and lower limits 
of objective function, respectively. 
From (8), the ADs’ seeding radius is set to the search space’s diameter. Then, 
it’s set to the distance between the current AD and the CD. DO include the planting 
radius of AD in the last iteration, where ω is a weighting factor, for slowing down 
convergence and boost global search efﬁciency, ω is designed as follows.

where SD is the number of all dandelions (normal seeds and mutant seeds), f i is the 
objective function’s ﬁtness value, and f avg is the generational mean ﬁtness value. 
People with average ﬁtness scores will be thrown out, but both good and bad 
people may have a better chance of being picked in the next round. This method

The performance of DA is compared with that of AOA, FSA, PFA, and BOA. The 
convergence criterion for all algorithms is the maximum number of iterations. 
5.1 
Simulations on IEEE 33-Bus Test System 
The base case test system has 33 nodes. The lowest voltage magnitude is registered 
at 0.9039 p.u. at bus 18. The voltage stability index (VSI) was observed at 0.6675. 
Also, the GHG emission and AVDI are estimated at 8.0382 e6 lb/hr and 0.0545 p.u., 
respectively. 
Using the proposed DA, the best way to connect three BESSs is planned by 
only thinking about how to minimize real power loss. At ﬁrst, the LSIs are deter-
mined to identify the top ten most preferable locations. Later, DA is implemented for 
determining optimal locations and sizes. The size of each BESS is limited to 2000 
kW. 
In the same way as with DA, Table 1 shows the best results from 50 independent 
runs of different algorithms. According to F value, BOA, PFA, and DA are very 
competitively produced at the global optimum. DA, on the other hand, performed 
well when the best, worst, median, and standard deviation were evaluated. As per 
computation time, DA has shown better computational features. From this, it can be

the GHG emission and AVDI are estimated at 8.2461 e6 lb/hr and 0.0014 p.u., 
respectively. 
Three BESSs are optimally planned to integrate using the proposed DA, consid-
ering only real power loss minimization. At ﬁrst, the LSIs are determined to identify 
the top ten most preferable locations. Later, DA is implemented for determining 
optimal locations and sizes. The size of each BESS is limited to 2000 kW. 
In a similar manner to DA, other algorithms, namely AOA, FSA, PFA, and BOA, 
are also simulated. The best results obtained over 50 independent runs are given 
in Table 1. According to objective function value, BPA, PFA, and DA are very 
competitively produced at the global optima. DA, on the other hand, performed well 
when best, worst, median, and standard deviation were evaluated. As per computation 
time, DA has shown better computational features. From this, it can be seen that DA 
is resulting in global optima. The convergence characteristics of these algorithms 
and the comparison of voltage proﬁles are given in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.
In a similar manner to IEEE 33-bus, the BESS parameters are taken as the same 
for this test system also. The required BESS is estimated at 278.56 MWh (Table 2).

6 Conclusion 
This paper presents a new optimization method based on the Dandelion Algorithm 
(DA) for improving EDN performance by integrating distributed battery energy 
storage systems (BESs) in the best way possible. The main goal is to cut down 
on real power distribution loss, and the effects of BES are also looked at in terms of 
the network voltage proﬁle, voltage stability, and GHG emissions. RDNs are used 
to ﬁgure out how well the proposed method works in terms of computation. Based 
on the results, it’s clear that DA works better than other heuristic algorithms. Also, 
the proposed DA improves all technological, economic, and environmental factors 
as well as the performance of the RDNs.

Introduction 
Crowd management refers to the choices and actions made to monitor and regulate 
heavily populated areas, and it entails a number of issues, from situational awareness 
and evaluation to the implementation of activities that are appropriate for the time 
being. Crowd control has grown more challenging, particularly when social distance 
is required. These problems can be solved with the use of Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies. 
Crowd management is the well-ordered organization and control of the lawful 
gathering and movement of people, and it entails the evaluation of individuals who 
test the viability of areas before their usage. Crowd management is the deliberate and 
systematic provision of direction for the orderly movement of huge crowds. As part of 
crowd management, steps can be done to limit or control how people behave in large 
groups. Crowd management is the term for this, which may involve securing public 
safety. Additionally, crowd management may be described as a series of preparations 
and actions made to facilitate, utilize, and move crowds. 
The structure of this survey article is as follows: In part 1, we discussed the basic 
concepts related to IoT. We detailed some great and often technologies related to IoT 
in part 2. The parameters like protocols, applications of IoT were outlined in part 3 
of this series. Part 4 contains the some IoT based framework for crowd management 
system. Part 5 contains the overall conclusion.

Basics of IoT 
The phrase “Internet of Things” (IoT) has been in use for quite a few years. It is 
gaining ground in this environment as improved wireless technology evolves. The 
presence of various things, including RFID, NFC, sensors, actuators, and mobile 
phones, is the fundamental tenet of this notion. IoT is used to incorporate a variety 
of market-available technologies, including RFID, machine-to-machine communica-
tion, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The term “Internet of Things” describes 
the coding and networking of commonplace items and things to make each one 
machine-readable and traceable on the Internet (Fig. 1). 
IoT functions through a concoction of physical devices, cloud computing, 
advanced data analytics, and wireless networking technology. IoT functions in a 
basic manner as shown in the following:
• A collection of physical objects is wired or wirelessly connected to one another 
or to a central location.
• The gadgets use some sort of sensor to get information from the outside 
environment.
• Then, the data is kept somewhere, be it on the device, in the cloud, or at a middle-
tier network site.
• Following that, the data is processed, frequently using artiﬁcial intelligence and 
machine learning.
• The physical gadget employs the processed data to execute a speciﬁc action.

Functional Blocks 
A multitude of functional building blocks make up an IoT system, giving it the 
capacity to recognize, perceive, act, communicate, and manage. These are the 
structural units:

327
• Device: Perform sensing, actuation, monitoring, and control tasks make up an IoT 
system.
• Communication: Manages communication in the IoT system.
• Services: This block gives services like device control, device monitoring, data 
transmission, and device discovery.
• Management: Several controls for the IoT system are provided by this block.
• Security: This block safeguards the IoT system by offering different functions 
related to data security.
• Application: Users can use this interface to manage and keep an eye on various 
parts of the IoT system. Users of the application can also see the position of the 
system and examine the processed data. 
4
Protocols
 
Within a certain IoT protocol, the application layer acts as the interface between 
the user and the device. The transport layer in every IoT protocol facilitates and 
secures data transmission as it passes between layers. An IoT protocol’s network 
layer facilitates device-to-router communication. The IoT protocol’s data layer is 
responsible for transferring data within the system architecture as well as detecting 
and ﬁxing any errors that were discovered in the physical layer. The physical layer 
serves as the communication pathway for gadgets inside a given setting. 
5 
Applications 
The Internet of Things is being employed in many other industries, such as 
agriculture, smart homes, healthcare, and the environment (Fig. 2).

Introduction 
Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are patient records that can be created, collected, 
managed and accessed by licensed medical and nursing personnel treatment. 
Providing a standard of security and personal access is one of the most important 
aspects of healthcare. In the age of big data, we use big data to store and access a lot of 
health information on the Internet. Cloud computing has played an important role in 
this process. Electronic health record (EHR) systems are easy to use and reliable, but 
raise many privacy and security concerns contains conﬁdential information. It is the 
most sensitive data collection method. The development of the Internet and digital 
health systems has made electronic health records vulnerable to security breaches. 
Therefore, the security and conﬁdentiality of EHR data should be considered when 
evaluating classiﬁcation based on reliability [1, 2].

II. EMR: 
An electronic medical record (EMR) is a digital copy of all information normally 
found in a health care facility’s paper records: medical history, diagnoses, medica-
tions, immunization records, allergies, results Tests and notes of a doctor in a medical 
facility. 
III. EHR: 
The digital form of patient’s health record is known as an Electronic Health Record 
(EHR). It is also called as digital version of a paper based patient record. The EHR is 
a patient-centric, real-time recording that makes information immediately and safely 
available to authorized users. 
1.2 
Problems with Current EMR Systems 
The healthcare hospitals, institutions and industries related to healthcare sectors 
are prime target for attackers due to the lack of technical expertise in the industry. 
Recent strikes on the healthcare industry highlight data safety challenges in the sector. 
Targeted strikes include phishing attacks and ransomware that obtain the information 
successfully but it is not limited to get personal data. In fact, the high success rate of 
ransomware strikes indicates a lack of basic security measures such as backups and 
updation in system. Medical applications such as EMR are very tactful because they 
directly involve individual and sensitive data that must be protected from unofﬁcial 
access [3].

Blockchain Technology 
2.1 
What is Blockchain? 
Blockchain is a system that records information in such a way that it is difﬁcult or 
impossible to change, control or disable the system. A blockchain is essentially a 
digital record of transactions distributed over a network of computer systems. Each 
block in the chain contains the cryptographic hash of the previous block, and when a 
new transaction occurs on the blockchain, information about the transaction is added 
to each participant’s ledger. A block with a name and content [4] (Fig. 1).
The Block Header Contains:
• Version: Speciﬁes the validation rules for the block.
• Hash of Previous block: This allows the old block to remain unchanged.
• Timestamp: The current time the block was created.

• Merkle root hash: The Merkle root is obtained from the hash value of every 
transaction in the block.
• Nonce: Nonce is a unique 4-byte number used only once in a message. This will 
be added to the karma that meets the difﬁculty limit.

Types of Blockchain 
2.2.1
Public Blockchain 
Public blockchains are permission less in nature, open to everyone, and fully decen-
tralized. It allows equal rights to all nodes present in the blockchain to access the 
blockchain & to create new data blocks, verify data blocks. 
2.2.2
Private Blockchain 
A private blockchain, is nothing but managed blockchain, it is an authorized 
blockchain which is controlled by a single entity. In this blockchain a central authority 
decides who becomes a node.

2.2.3
Consortium Blockchain 
A permissioned blockchain is managed by a group of entities rather than a single 
entity like a private blockchain. Therefore, the consortium chain is more decentralized 
than the private chain, which provides a guarantee. 
2.2.4
Hybrid Blockchain 
It is a type blockchain and it is controlled by a single entity. It requires some degree 
of oversight over the public blockchain to perform validation of speciﬁc transactions 
(Fig. 2). 
2.3 
Consensus Mechanism 
2.3.1
Proof of Work 
In this example, miners mine blocks to solve cryptographic puzzles and connect them 
to the blockchain. This method requires a lot of energy and computing power. The 
puzzles are designed so that the system is difﬁcult and demanding. When the miners 
solve the puzzle, the blocks are sent to the network for veriﬁcation.

2.3.2
Proof of Stack 
Proof of Stack is a blockchain method that works by selecting validators in proportion 
to their associated cryptocurrency holdings. This is done to avoid the computational 
cost of proof-of-work schemes. 
2.3.3
RAFT 
RAFT is a distributed, fault-based negotiation algorithm that allows the system to 
decide and serve the requestor in the event of a failure. RAFT has been approved 
by elected ofﬁcials. Servers on Raft can be followers, leaders, or competitors. The 
leader is responsible for copying the diary to the followers [5].

Understanding Hyperledger Fabric in Detail 
Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain model that provides the foundation for building 
blockchain products, solutions, and plug-and-play products designed for private 
businesses. The main difference between Hyperledger Fabric and other blockchain 
systems is that it is private and proprietary. The membership of the Hyperledger 
Fabric network is designed to represent an open, permission less system that allows 
unknown parties to join the network (processes such as Proof of Work must verify 
the work and security of the network and from the trusted service provider (MSP)) 
names. Below are the key architectures built into the Hyperledger Framework to 
build a complete and customizable blockchain business solution [8].
• Assets: The concept of an asset allows for the exchange of almost any value on 
the network, from natural foods to vintage cars and currencies of the future.
• Chaincode: The implementation of Chaincode is separated from the exchange of 
orders, optimizing network scalability and performance by limiting the level of 
trust and proof required by different node types.
• Ledger Features: Channel and personal data collection enable private and conﬁ-
dential multilateral transactions. This is typically required by competitors or 
regulated industries exchanging assets over a common network.
• Conﬁdentiality: The processing and collection of personal information ensures 
the privacy and conﬁdentiality of transactions with multiple parties. This is often 
required by competitors or business management to share assets across the public 
network.
• Enrollment Services and Security: Qualiﬁed members guarantee a secure 
blockchain network and members understand that all proceedings may be 
recognized and monitored by accredited regulators and auditors.
• Consensus: a distinctive and consistent outlook gives your business ﬂexibility 
and scalability.

Simple Hyperledger Fabric Network 
Three organizations Org1, Org2, and Org0, decide to create a network together. 
With CC1 conﬁguration that matches all the peer organizations, CC1 is the Conﬁgu-
ration Block for whole group of organization. Before starting communication all the 
organizations must create their identities of the admin from Certiﬁcation Authority 
(CA), Every organization has their own Certiﬁcation Authority (CA) here Org1, Org2 
and Org0 having CA1, CA2 and CA0 are the Certiﬁcation Authorities of these three 
Organizations [6] (Fig. 3). 
CA generate certiﬁcates required for respective node, administrators, organiza-
tion deﬁnitions, and applications. It plays an important role in the network identi-
fying organizational components. Peers are prime points in the network, so N/W Org1 
and Org2, P1 and P2 are connected to the C1 environment and Org0 has O control of 
the environment. All nodes have a copy of the channel ledger (L1) where transactions 
are recorded. The judicial service keeps a copy of the registry, but not state records. 
Org1, Org2 also interacting with channels through their personal applications A1 
and A2. Org1 and Org2 organizations join the channel. The application can access 
L1 record via S5 smart contract and create organization recognized transactions with 
the name speciﬁed in the authorization policy and listed on the form.

Type of Nodes 
Nodes are communication units in the blockchain. A “node” is just a single operating 
system and many different nodes can run on the same physical server. What matters 
is how nodes are grouped into “key domains” and how they join the organizations 
that manage them [7].
• Client or submitting-client: Customers send actual transaction calls to validators 
and trade proposals to the ordering service.
• Peer: A client sends actual transaction calls to validators and trade proposals to 
an ordering service.
• Ordering service: A service order that receives changes from different customers 
at the same time. The task of the order is to determine the batch of goods sent 
in an order and put them in blocks. These blocks are considered as blocks of the 
blockchain. 
3.3 
Smart Contract and Chaincode 
In Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain code is a smart contract that runs on peers 
and generates transactions. Applications interact with blockchain ledgers through 
blockchain code. Therefore, the blockchain code must be installed on each peer-to-
peer application that supports the transaction and is initialized on the channel. 
3.4 
Beneﬁts of Blockchain in EMR 
Keeping critical medical data safe is the most popular healthcare blockchain appli-
cation today, and it’s no surprise. Safety is an important issue in medicine. Over 176 
million medical records were compromised in data breaches between 2009 and 2017. 
Perpetrators stole credit card and bank details, health and genetic testing records. The 
main beneﬁts of using blockchain on EMR are:
• Decentralization: All stakeholders have access to the same copy of health 
records, and everyone has the same access and control. No single entity controls 
your data
• Security and Privacy: Blockchain helps create a tamper-proof record due 
to its immutable properties. All records are encrypted, time-stamped and 
added chronologically to an existing distributed database. Patient privacy and 
identity are protected by cryptographic keys.
• Data Ownership: Patients are assured that their records will not be misused 
or altered. He has full control over his data. This is achieved through strong 
cryptographic protocols and predeﬁned smart contracts.

• Data Veriﬁability: Any interested party can verify the integrity and validity 
of the records stored on the blockchain. This feature is mainly applicable when 
a data validation process is required.
• Trust: Blockchain records are accessible to anyone, so there is no need to question 
whether information has been tampered with for personal gain.

Conclusion 
Hyperledger Fabric is a promising blockchain framework with several concepts for 
providing secure identities that make policies, smart contracts, and records secure 
and controllable. This allows the EMR system to interoperate across multiple hospital 
organizations. Doctors can easily track your medical history. Patients will not need to 
carry a case ﬁle and digital records will be greatly improved. The EMR scenario falls 
into the category of private and closed blockchains, and the solution can successfully 
conclude that this is an encouraging structure for this type of blockchain. It provides 
a reliable and secure medical records management solution. Many improvements 
and modiﬁcation can be made to improve the solution. Today, data is critical to 
the advancement of any technology. The model of machine learning contains lot 
of valid data and it needs to be re-authenticate. With this solution, you can safely 
examine a patient’s medical data without knowing the patient’s identity. This can 
improve the accuracy of machine learning models and will greatly improve the 
healthcare sector. I used text recipe. Physicians have to enter prescriptions into a 
patient’s EMR, which takes a lot of the doctor’s precious time. So it can be done by 
adding a voice recipe.
