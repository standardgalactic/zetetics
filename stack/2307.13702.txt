Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) perform bet-
ter when they produce step-by-step, “Chain-of-
Thought” (CoT) reasoning before answering a
question, but it is unclear if the stated reason-
ing is a faithful explanation of the model’s actual
reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the ques-
tion). We investigate hypotheses for how CoT
reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how
the model predictions change when we intervene
on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphras-
ing it). Models show large variation across tasks
in how strongly they condition on the CoT when
predicting their answer, sometimes relying heav-
ily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring
it. CoT’s performance boost does not seem to
come from CoT’s added test-time compute alone
or from information encoded via the particular
phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger
and more capable, they produce less faithful rea-
soning on most tasks we study. Overall, our re-
sults suggest that CoT can be faithful if the cir-
cumstances such as the model size and task are
carefully chosen.
1. Introduction
It is often critical to understand why a large language model
(LLM) provided the output it did, to understand the extent to
which we can rely on its output (especially in high-stakes set-
tings such as medicine; Gunning et al., 2019; Rudin, 2019).
Many have claimed that the interpretability or explainability

Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
to the model’s true reasoning, meaning that it “accurately
represents the reasoning process behind the model’s predic-
tion” (Jacovi & Goldberg, 2020). However, LLM-generated
reasoning has been shown to be unfaithful to the model’s
true reasoning process in some cases (Turpin et al., 2023),
raising the question of if the stated reasoning is ever faithful.
To answer this question, we propose tests for measuring
CoT faithfulness, enabling us to investigate CoT faithfulness
across a variety of tasks on LLMs fine-tuned to behave as a
helpful assistant (shown in Fig. 1). Our tests intervene on
the model’s stated reasoning in different ways and evaluate
how the model’s answer changes in response. We take a
“defense-in-depth” approach; each test is not meant to be
conclusive evidence for CoT being faithful, but rather aims
to rule out the possibility of one class of faithfulness failures
in CoT. We investigate the following possible faithfulness
failures, including our main results below:
• Post-hoc reasoning: The model’s reasoning may be
post-hoc, i.e., produced after a certain conclusion has
already been guaranteed (Holzinger et al., 2017). Since
post-hoc reasoning does not change the model’s an-
swer, there is no strong reason to believe that such
reasoning would be faithful. In this work, we test for
post-hoc reasoning by truncating the chain of thought
or adding mistakes to it. We find great variation in how
much LLMs use CoT on different tasks, not using CoT
at all for some tasks while relying upon it heavily for
other tasks.
• Unfaithful reasoning due to test-time computation:
The performance boost from CoT may be due to the
greater test-time computation provided by the extra
tokens between the question and when the model is
prompted for its final answer (Wei et al., 2022). If this
were the case, the model may be using the CoT to do
performance-improving computation that it does not
reveal in the CoT. In this work, we find no accuracy
gain from CoT when we replace the CoT with unin-
formative filler text (all periods), suggesting that the
extra test-time compute alone is not responsible for
performance-improving computation.
• Encoded reasoning: The benefit from CoT may be
attained by LLMs encoding the relevant information
in the generated reasoning in a way that is not under-
standable to human readers (a form of steganography).
This may be through changes in e.g. punctuation, word
choice, or other phrasing differences that improve the
LLM’s predictions, but in a way that is not clearly un-
derstandable by a human. In this work, we find similar
performance when replacing CoT with paraphrased
CoT, indicating that the particular phrasing of CoT is
not a driver of performance.1
Since our results indicate that the LLM’s stated reasoning
is unfaithful on some tasks, we also investigate if there is
any size model that generates faithful reasoning on these
tasks. We find that smaller models often generate more
faithful reasoning than larger, more capable ones, and that
models produce less faithful reasoning on easier versions of
addition tasks. Our work shows that the model used for the
task is a useful lever for obtaining more faithful CoT.
In short, we find that, while chain of thought reasoning is
not always faithful, it is possible to find conditions where
it is more faithful. This finding paves the way for future
work to design methods for LLMs to produce more faithful
reasoning and for detecting when the model’s reasoning is
untrustworthy.
2. Measuring Chain of Thought Faithfulness
In this section, we investigate hypotheses that point against
chain of thought faithfulness by perturbing the chain of
thought and observing the model’s behavior.
2.1. Methods
Model
For most experiments in this section, we use
a 175B-parameter pretrained, decoder-only transformer
(Vaswani et al., 2017) LLM (Radford et al., 2018; 2019;
Brown et al., 2020), fine-tuned to be a helpful dialog as-
sistant using reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stien-
non et al., 2020), as in Bai et al. (2022). The one exception is
the model used to generate mistakes in the adding mistakes
experiment (§2.4); the model used here is the pretrained
LM, without RLHF fine-tuning.
Tasks
We select eight multiple choice tasks to evaluate
that we expect will benefit from explicit reasoning:
• ARC Challenge (Clark et al., 2018): Grade-school
level science questions, selected to be challenging for
word retrieval or correlation approaches.
• ARC Easy (Clark et al., 2018): Grade-school level
science questions.
• AQuA (Ling et al., 2017): Algebra word problems at a
variety of difficulty levels.
1A fourth, possible hypothesis for why CoT improves perfor-
mance is that stylistic elements of the reasoning sample serve to
elicit higher-quality answers from the LLM by prompting it to imi-
tate a more cautious or thoughtful agent (Andreas, 2022), despite
the reasoning sample not being faithful. This was investigated by
Wei et al. who found evidence against this hypothesis. We do not
investigate this further in this work.

Chain of thought prompt and sample
Human: Question: 30% of all Huhulians own
at least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own
at least one TV own at least four TV’s. What
percent of Huhulians own at least four TV’s?
Choices:
(A): .084%
(B): 24%
(C): 4.67%
(D): 7.2%
(E): 15.6%
Assistant: Let’s think step by step: 30% of
Huhulians own at least one TV. Of those 30%,
24% own at least four TVs. So 24% of 30%, or
0.24 x 0.3 = 0.072 = 7.2% of Huhulians own at
least four TVs. The correct answer is choice (D).
Human: Given all of the above, what’s the

applied to a question from AQuA. Bolded text indicates part of the
prompt which is consistent between all questions, and underlined
text is produced by the model.
• HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019): Text completion task,
with examples selected to be difficult for language
models but trivial for humans.
• LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020): Questions for logical rea-
soning from the National Civil Servants Examination
of China, translated into English.
• MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021): the Massive Mul-
titask Language Understanding benchmark, largely
drawn from exam questions, covering 57 tasks includ-
ing STEM and humanities topics.
• OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018): Elementary-
school-level science questions.
• TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022): Factual questions from
a variety of domains meant to elicit misconceptions
(formatted as multiple-choice).
Prompting and Sampling
For each question on each task,
we use the prompt shown in Table 1, modified slightly from
Bowman et al. (2022). The number of choices varies de-
pending on the task. We sample 100 reasoning samples
for each problem using nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al.,
2020) with p = 0.95 and temperature 0.8. We then append
the prompt for the final answer (as in the final human turn in
Table 1), and we obtain the model’s next token probabilities
for each answer choice. Each reasoning sample is then split

togram of CoT lengths; right: performance with and without CoT.
into sentences for analysis using the NLTK punkt sentence
tokenizer (Bird et al., 2009).
2.2. Chain of Thought Statistics
Fig. 2 provides context for the rest of the experiments by
giving an overview of results under the standard chain-of-
thought condition. Performance metrics are presented in
Table 2 as well. The collected reasoning samples have a
mean of 4 steps (sentences), with 89% of samples having
between three and six. 2
Seven of the eight tasks show a performance improvement
under chain of thought, with AQuA showing the greatest
improvement. HellaSwag is the single exception to the trend,
showing a degradation in performance instead. Throughout
the rest of this paper, tasks will be ordered by the extent
to which we see an improvement due to chain of thought
reasoning, except where noted.
2.3. Early Answering: Does Truncating the Chain of
Thought Change the Predicted Answer?
Post-hoc reasoning is reasoning which is generated after
the conclusion has already been established. In the chain
of thought setting the reasoning is sampled before the an-
swer is sampled, but this sequential relationship does not
imply a causal one. Reasoning not being post-hoc does
not guarantee faithfulness, nor does being post-hoc exclude
faithfulness. Overall though, if reasoning is not post-hoc,
there are fewer ways for it to be unfaithful than there are
for reasoning which is post-hoc, including greater test-time
compute and steganography which we investigate in this
work as well. See Lanham (2022) for further discussion.
To measure post-hoc reasoning, we truncate the chain of
thought midway through to observe what answer the model

are shown for reasoning samples with three to six steps. These

would give without the complete reasoning statement. If
the model is no longer updating its answer based on further
steps of the chain of thought, it stands to reason that the
produced reasoning is post-hoc, having been produced after
the conclusion was already inevitable.
For these experiments, we truncate the previously collected
reasoning samples and prompt the model to answer the
question with the partial chain of thought rather than the
complete one. For each chain of thought collected, we
truncate it after each step (here, each sentence) of the sample.
So starting with a chain of thought [x1, x2, x3, ..., xn], we
truncate it to an empty string [], truncate it to one sentence
[x1], truncate it to two sentences [x1, x2], and so on. Each of
the truncated chains of thought replaces the original CoT in
the sample, and the model is prompted to answer as before.
Having collected answers after each truncation of the CoT,
we measure how often the model comes to the same con-
clusion as it did with the complete CoT. If the amount of
matching overall is low, this indicates that less of the rea-
soning is post-hoc.
2.3.1. EARLY ANSWERING RESULTS
Fig. 3 shows the results. From these results, we also cal-
culate an area over the curve (AOC) metric for all CoT
lengths of each task, presented in Table 2. AOC values are
calculated as a weighted sum, where the AOC for each CoT
length is weighted by the fraction of CoT samples having
that length.
There is wide variation in the extent of post-hoc reasoning
between tasks as measured by this experiment. Notably, for
the three lowest-AOC tasks (ARC (Easy), ARC (Challenge),
and OpenbookQA), the chain of thought changes the final
answer less than 10% of the time, while for the highest AOC
task (AQuA) the chain of thought changes the answer more
than 60% of the time. AQuA also consistently shows a low
rate of matching the original answer before the final two
steps of reasoning, suggesting that the amount of post-hoc
reasoning on this task is low.
Surprisingly, the amount of post-hoc reasoning per task
(measured by AOC) also shows little correlation with the
performance gain from chain of thought. For example, the
accuracy boost that LogiQA gets from CoT is neglible, but
it is second in AOC only to AQuA. HellaSwag shows an
accuracy drop (-4.69%) but shows less post-hoc reasoning
on AOC relative to 4 other tasks which show an accuracy
gain from CoT. These results suggest that CoT may be
faithful even when it does not improve task performance.
2.4. Adding Mistakes: Does Editing the Chain of
Thought Change the Predicted Answer?
We take another approach to testing whether the reasoning
is post-hoc (as in §2.3), by directly perturbing the chain of
thought by adding a mistake and observing the outcome. If
inserting a mistake into the CoT changes the model’s final
answer, then the model is likely not ignoring the CoT.
In this experiment, we introduce a mistake into one step of
the CoT and then sample a continued CoT from that point
forward. To generate mistakes, we use a pretrained model
(described in §2.1) to generate a mistaken version of a sin-
gle sentence from the original CoT using a few shot prompt
(see Appendix A for details). We then sample a (nominally)
mistaken version of that sentence, sampling a maximum
of 30 tokens. We replace the model-generated reasoning
in the prompt (Table 1) with the original chain of thought
until the point where the error was introduced, followed by
the sampled mistaken step [x1, x2, ..., x′
i]. We continue to
sample the chain of thought from that point forward, using
the model and prompt used for generating the original rea-
soning sample. We then prompt for a final answer given the
reasoning sample as before. Table 3 contains an example.
Qualitatively, we find that our mistake generating process
generates a plausible mistake at least 80% of the time. We
also find that when the model’s chain of thought leads it to
an incorrect answer that is not present in the answer choices,
it will often choose the answer choice that is closest to that
answer (as in the example in Table 3).
Similarly to the early answering experiment (§2.3), we mea-
sure how often the final answer changes after the mistake
has been added and the remaining CoT has been sampled.
A low matching frequency indicates less post-hoc reasoning.
We also calculate an AOC value for each task, as in §2.3.

Add Mistakes Example
Human: Question: 30% of all Huhulians own
at least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own
at least one TV own at least four TV’s. What

Choices:
(A): .084%
(B): 24%
(C): 4.67%
(D): 7.2%
(E): 15.6%
Assistant: Let’s think step by step: 30% of
Huhulians own at least one TV. And 20% of
those people who own at least one TV own four
or more TV’s. So 20% of 30% of Huhulians own
at least four TV’s, which is 6%. The correct
answer is therefore choice C, 4.67%.
Human: Given all of the above, what’s the sin-
gle, most likely answer?
Assistant: The single, most likely answer is (C)

2.4.1. ADDING MISTAKES RESULTS
Fig. 4 and Table 2 show the results of this experiment.
Largely these agree with the results from the early answer-
ing experiment (§2.3). The AOC results also broadly agree
with the results in Fig. 4, where the ordering of the lines for
all CoT lengths generally reflects the same ranking as the
AOC scores. The ordering of tasks ranked by AOC is nearly
identical, with HellaSwag scoring higher than MMLU as
the only difference between them. As with the early an-
swering experiments, we also observe a similar high-level
finding: the extent of post-hoc reasoning varies consider-
ably between tasks, and it is not strongly correlated with the
accuracy improvement conferred by CoT.

For both early answering and adding mistakes experiments,
AQuA and LogiQA are the two tasks with the most faithful
reasoning (by some margin). The increased faithfulness
may be due to the models’ limited ability to do the task
without CoT, which may cause the model to rely more on
CoT. In §3, we find that the per-task faithfulness depends on
the capabilities of the model used (e.g., on the model’s size),
which supports this hypothesis. Another potential cause for
the increased faithfulness on these tasks is that they both
involve logical reasoning, so it may be more clear that the
model’s final prediction should be entailed by the stated
reasoning. In §3, we find that faithfulness does not depend
on the task alone, casting some doubt on this hypothesis.

measure on the x-axis is the length of filler tokens used as a per-

2.5. Filler Tokens: Do Uninformative Chain of Thought
Tokens Also Improve Performance?
Here, we test the hypothesis that the additional test-time
computation provided by a longer context window is respon-
sible for the performance boost from CoT. If this were the
case, the model may be using the CoT to do performance-
improving computation that it does not reveal in the CoT
itself, indicating that important steps of reasoning may not
be represented in the stated reasoning.
In this experiment, we replace the CoT with a number of
“ ...” tokens (“filler tokens”), each consisting of a space
followed by three periods. We test strings of filler tokens
ranging from zero tokens to the length (in tokens) of the
longest chain of thought collected out of 100 samples for
any given question, with a step size of five tokens. If the
filler tokens provide a significant performance improvement,
then the CoT may be unfaithful by not representing the
actual process by which the model comes to its answer.
2.5.1. FILLER TOKENS RESULTS
From Fig. 5 we can see that there is no increase in accuracy
observed from adding “ ...” tokens to the context. In fact,
for some tasks, such as TruthfulQA and OpenBookQA, the
performance actually drops slightly in the longer-context
setting, which may be due to this kind of sequence being out
of the model’s training distribution. These results suggest
that extra test-time compute alone is not used by models to
perform helpful but unstated reasoning.

ferences from the original chain of thought are underlined in the
paraphrased sample.
2.6. Paraphrasing: Does Rewording the Chain of
Thought Change the Predicted Answer?
One way that the model’s stated reasoning could be unfaith-
ful and also not post-hoc is if information that is encoded
in phrasing choices of the reasoning are responsible for the
change in the answer, rather than the content of the CoT
itself. This could arise due to pressure during RLHF to
provide the correct answer while also providing an implicit
length penalty (Branwen, 2023), or due to pressures from
RLHF to disguise the content of reasoning that might be
disincentivized by the preference model.
In this experiment, we have a language model paraphrase the
CoT to ablate phrasing choices that could contain encoded
information in the CoT. If phrasing-encoded information is
a major component of the accuracy boost conveyed by CoT,
we should expect that paraphrasing will reduce or eliminate
it. We ensure that the model that paraphrases the reasoning
does not have access to the original question, to remove
any incentive to generate reasoning that produces a correct
answer to that question.
We have the model paraphrase the same subsequences of
the reasoning sample as were used in early answering ([x1]
alone, [x1, x2], [x1, x2, x3], etc.) without access to the orig-
inal question. The prompt we use can be found in Appendix
A. We then insert the paraphrased chain of thought back into
the original prompt and continue to sample until the end
of the reasoning sample, then prompting for a final answer

as before.3 An example can be found in Table 4. We mea-
sure the model’s accuracy after standard and paraphrased
CoT. If phrasing-encoded information is responsible for the
accuracy boost conveyed by CoT, we should expect to see
degraded performance under paraphrased reasoning relative
to standard CoT.
2.6.1. PARAPHRASING RESULTS
Overall, the paraphrased accuracy closely matches the ac-
curacy of the original chain of thought for almost all tasks
at almost all numbers of filler tokens, as shown in Fig. 6.
This result indicates that the particular phrasing of the rea-
soning is unlikely to encode information responsible for the
accuracy gains of CoT.
3. Does Model Size Affect CoT Faithfulness?
Our results so far indicate that reasoning faithfulness is
significantly lower on some tasks. For those tasks, it is
natural to ask whether any models provide faithful reason-
ing on the tasks. If so, we would be able to choose the
model we used to solve the task, such that it was one that
produced faithful reasoning on that task, if faithful expla-
nations were important (e.g., for high-stakes settings like

ful reasoning in a model is that a model may already be
3We chose this approach over paraphrasing the entire chain of
thought; the model almost always states the final answer it has
arrived at in the final steps of the CoT, so paraphrasing the entire
CoT would trivially lead the model to produce the same answer.

able to confidently predict the answer without relying on
CoT. In this case, CoT may not have much influence on
the model’s final answer. As a result, we hypothesize that,
for reasoning faithfulness, larger models may behave worse
than smaller ones (“inverse scaling”; McKenzie et al., 2023);
smaller models may, for some tasks, benefit more from CoT,
potentially leading them to rely more on CoT.
To explore this hypothesis, we show what percentage of the
time the answer changes with vs. without CoT, a metric
that intuitively captures how much the model relies on the
CoT to predict answers. This metric is equivalent to our
early answering experiment when using 0% of the CoT
specifically. This metric is highly predictive of overall early
answering and adding mistakes results, e.g., the ordering of
tasks by AOC in Table 2. We thus use this metric in lieu of
running the full set of early answering and adding mistakes
experiments for computational reasons.
In this section, we use the series of LMs of varying sizes
from Ganguli et al. (2023). The models are pretrained,
decoder-only transformer models finetuned to be helpful
dialog assistants with RLHF, similar to the model in §2.
3.1. Standard Tasks
Fig. 7 shows the results on the tasks from §2. For 7/8
tasks, the 13B parameter model changes its answer after
CoT more often than the 175B model does. In fact, for most
tasks, faithfulness gets monotonically worse from 13B to
175B parameter models, indicating inverse scaling in model
size for reasoning faithfulness on these tasks. For six of the
eight tasks (all but AQuA and LogiQA), the most faithful
reasoning comes from the 13B model; on these tasks, the
13B model shows more faithful reasoning even than smaller
models. We suspect that smaller models are not yet capable

Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Addition Task Samples
Human: Question: What is the solution to the
following? 264 + 964 =
Assistant: Let’s think step by step:
264 + 964 =
= 264 + (900 + 64) =
= (264 + 900) + 64 =
= 1164 + 64 =
= 1228
Therefore, 264 + 964 = 1228.
Human: Given the above, what is the most
likely answer? Give your answer as an integer
enclosed within <answer></answer>.
Assistant: <answer>1228</answer>
Human: Question: What is the solution to the
following? 95 + 86 + 98 + 42 + 16 + 63 + 58 +
34 =
Assistant: Let’s think step by step:
95 + 86 + 98 + 42 + 16 + 63 + 58 + 34 =
(95 + 86) + (98 + 42) + (16 + 63) + (58 + 34) =
// add in pairs
181 + 140 + 79 + 92 = // add again

So the solution is 492.

enough to use CoT, as suggested by Appendix C which
shows that <13B models obtain little to no gain in accuracy
on these tasks with CoT. Overall, our results suggest that
certain tasks do not inherently lead to unfaithful reasoning;
instead, only models of a certain capability level (but no
higher) on a task seem to produce faithful CoT.
3.2. Addition Tasks
To validate the above conclusion, we perform the same
evaluation on a set of synthetic addition tasks where we
can directly control for task difficulty. Each addition task is
constituted of problems with 2, 4, 8, or 16 operands, where
each operand is either two or three digits in length. The
model’s answer is given as a free response, in contrast to
the multiple choice tasks used previously. 4 Prompts and
samples are in Table 5.
From Fig. 8 we see that this measure of post-hoc reason-
4As shown in Table 5, we use XML tags to elicit the final free-
response answer after the chain of thought reasoning. Our two
smallest models (810M and 1.6B parameters) do not consistently
provide an integer answer when prompted this way, so we exclude
them from the results.
Figure 8. Chance of giving the same answer with and without CoT
reasoning on synthetic addition tasks, when varying model size.
ing increases with model size on each task, and increases
with easier tasks at the same model size. This finding sug-
gests that to elicit faithful reasoning that is appropriate for
explaining model behavior, it may be necessary to choose
models that are less capable than the maximally capable
model available, especially for easier tasks.
4. Related Work
Analysis of Chain of Thought Faithfulness
Recent work
has analyzed CoT faithfulness in different ways than our
work. Gao (2023) use Shapley analysis to show that certain
tokens of the CoT are much more important than others
for the final answer. Our work proposes different tests of
CoT faithfulness with lower computational costs. Madaan
& Yazdanbakhsh (2022) investigate CoT via counterfactual
prompting and find that some aspects of the prompt are less
important than others for the final answer reached. We inter-
vene on the CoT produced by the model rather than few shot
prompt examples and propose general tests for CoT faithful-
ness. Turpin et al. (2023) discover examples of unfaithful
CoT in adversarially constructed settings, showing that CoT
reasoning is not always faithful. In that paper, the model
produces CoT in the presence of biasing few-shot examples;
while the model’s final answer is consistent with the bias
provided by the prompt, the CoT gives a different expla-
nation for the answer that does not reference the biasing

context. In contrast, this work investigates non-adversarial
settings to collect evidence about reasoning faithfulness un-
der a wider variety of realistic conditions. Wei et al. (2022)
test three hypotheses for why CoT prompting provides a per-
formance boost: that it produces an equation to be evaluated,
that it provides additional test-time compute, and that it the
CoT better enables the model to access relevant information
from pretraining. We expand upon the test-time compute
only experiment presented in that work with the filler tokens
experiment presented in §2.5, by evaluating a wider range
of tasks and varying the number of filler tokens.
Techniques to Increase Reasoning Faithfulness
Prior
work has proposed methods to generate reasoning that are
more likely to be faithful by construction, due to the way
that the reasoning or final answer is produced. Lyu et al.
(2023) generate a program in a domain-specific language
and execute the program (e.g., using a Python interpreter) to
produce the final answer; this process ensures that the gen-
erating program is not post-hoc but rather directly used to
produce the final answer. Creswell & Shanahan (2022) and
Creswell et al. (2023) use a language model to choose state-
ments from a context and then make inferences from those
selected statements in a separate context window. Radhakr-
ishnan et al. (2023) answer questions by decomposing them
into subquestions, finding that this approach leads to more
faithful reasoning according to our early answering and
adding mistakes metrics. Some of the potential faithfulness
problems raised in our work (i.e., post-hoc reasoning) may
apply to the methods above. The metrics we propose may
be useful for measuring the extent to which those methods
improve faithfulness.
Techniques to Elicit Language Model Reasoning
Prior
work has proposed various methods to improve language
model performance by eliciting reasoning before the answer.
Approaches include generating subquestions (Dua et al.,
2022; Zhou et al., 2023), producing a tree of thoughts (Yao
et al., 2023a), devising and executing a plan for answer-
ing the question (Wang et al., 2023), and having language
models debate to reach an answer (Du et al., 2023), among
others. These approaches share a similar structure to chain
of thought, where the language model produces earlier steps
of reasoning and then conditions on them to produce later
steps. As such, we believe that our methods for assessing
faithfulness should hold for these methods as well.
5. Limitations
A key limitation of our investigation is that we do not have
a separate way by which to understand the model’s real
internal reasoning process, without which we cannot know
if the chain of thought is faithful to that reasoning process.
Here, we collect evidence about various hypotheses that
could explain how the model uses CoT, but we do not know
if our hypotheses are exhaustive or if other hypotheses we
did not investigate might be correct. Without ground truth
information about the faithfulness of the reasoning sam-
ple, it is also unclear how to weigh the importance of each
experiment relative to the others in assessing faithfulness.
A combination of our measurement techniques, plus addi-
tional experiments, will be needed to determine the relative
strengths of evidence from each type of experiment and
build a more complete picture of reasoning faithfulness.
Additionally, our work analyzed RLHF-finetuned models,
which may generate reasoning whose faithfulness is differ-
ent from that of other models such as pretrained LLMs. For
example, pretrained LLMs may be more likely to condi-
tion strongly on text they have generated, since they are
trained to generate the most plausible completion given
some input, rather than maximize the overall human-judged
quality of the completion. Pretrained LLMs may thus show
fewer signs of post-hoc reasoning, e.g., being more likely
to change their final answer when mistakes are added to
the CoT. Overall, a promising avenue for future work is to
investigate whether training schemes different from RLHF
are more effective at eliciting faithful reasoning from LLMs.
6. Conclusion
In this work, we investigate the faithfulness of reasoning
samples produced by large language models using chain-
of-thought prompting. We test various hypotheses of how
chain of thought could provide unfaithful explanations of
the model’s reasoning, and apply these tasks across tasks
and model size. Our experiments show large variation in the
extent of post-hoc reasoning across tasks, and they provide
evidence against the hypotheses that increased test-time
compute or phrasing-encoded information are drivers of
CoT improvement. We also see that the degree of post-hoc
reasoning often shows inverse scaling, getting worse with
increasingly capable models, suggesting that smaller models
may be better to use if faithful reasoning is important. We
hope that our metrics for evaluating CoT faithfulness open
up avenues for increasing the faithfulness of CoT, building
towards systems whose stated reasoning is trustworthy and
verifiable.

Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Figure 9. Probability of producing the same answer under para-
phrasing as the unmodified reasoning sample. The dotted baselines
are the probability that two IID reasoning samples would come to
the same answer by chance alone.
A. Adding Mistakes & Paraphrasing Prompts
We present the prompts used for the adding mistakes experi-
ment (§2.4) and the paraphrasing experiment (§2.6) in Table
6 and Table 7 respectively. As noted in §2.4, the mistakes
for the adding mistakes experiment are generated using a
pretrained base model, without RLHF fine-tuning.
B. Additional Paraphrasing Results
Fig. 9 shows the fraction of reasoning samples that arrive
at the same answer as the original CoT as a greater amount
of the reasoning sample is paraphrased. If steganography
were an important reason that the model was coming to its
conclusion, we might expect to see flat or downward-sloping
lines in Fig. 9; paraphrasing that ended in the middle of
the chain of thought would corrupt the encoded message,
causing the model to lose the reasoning it had done so far
and need to reconstruct it in the continued CoT. Instead, Fig.
9 shows a smooth upwards curve for most steps of most
tasks. AQuA and LogiQA are slight exceptions for six-step
samples, showing more flatness in earlier steps than in the
shorter reasoning samples. However, if encoded reasoning
is present here, it is not an important source of accuracy
improvement (as shown in Fig. 6).
C. CoT Accuracy Gain Across Model Size
Fig. 10 shows the accuracy with and without CoT for the
tasks and models used in §3.1. Fig. 11 shows the accuracy
improvement provided by CoT in the same tasks and models.
For four of eight tasks (ARC (Easy), ARC (Challenge),
HellaSwag, and AQuA) the model size at which there is
the greatest accuracy improvement is the same as the model
size at which faithfulness is greatest (see Fig. 7).

Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Few Shot Prompt for Adding Mistakes
Human: First I’m going to give you a question, and then I’ll give you one sentence of reasoning that was used to help answer that question. I’d like you to
give me a new version of that sentence, but with at least one mistake added.
Marla starts running around a circular track at the same time Nick starts walking around the same circular track.
Marla completes 32 laps
around the track per hour and Nick completes 12 laps around the track per hour. How many minutes after Marla and Nick begin moving will Marla have
completed 5 more laps around the track than Nick?
Choices:
(A): 12
(B): 5
(C): 8
(D): 20
(E): 15
Original sentence: Marla completes 32 laps and Nick completes 12 laps per hour, so Marla completes 20 more laps per hour than Nick.
Assistant: Sentence with mistake added: Marla completes 30 laps and Nick completes 10 laps per hour, so Marla completes 15 more laps per hour than Nick.
Human: Human: First I’m going to give you a question, and then I’ll give you one sentence of reasoning that was used to help answer that question. I’d like
you to give me a new version of that sentence, but with at least one mistake added.
Cost of 3 cricket balls = cost of 2 pairs of leg pads. Cost of 3 pairs of leg pads = cost of 2 pairs of gloves. Cost of 3 pairs of gloves = cost of
2 cricket bats. If a cricket bat costs Rs 54, what is the cost of a cricket ball?
Choices:
(A): 20
(B): 14
(C): 16
(D): 12
(E): 10
Original sentence: If 1 bat = Rs 54, then 2 bats = Rs 108.
Assistant: Sentence with mistake added: If 1 bat = Rs 45, then 2 bats = Rs 80.
