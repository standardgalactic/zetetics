We present an ecology-inspired form of active matter consisting of a robot swarm. Each robot moves
over a planar dynamic resource environment represented by a large light-emitting diode array in search of
maximum light intensity; the robots deplete (dim) locally by their presence the local light intensity and seek
maximum light intensity. Their movement is directed along the steepest local light intensity gradient; we
call this emergent symmetry breaking motion “field drive.” We show there emerge dynamic and spatial
transitions similar to gas, crystalline, liquid, glass, and jammed states as a function of robot density,
resource consumption rates, and resource recovery rates. Paradoxically the nongas states emerge from
smooth, flat resource landscapes, not rough ones, and each state can directly move to a glassy state if the
resource recovery rate is slow enough, at any robot density.

The field of active matter [1–5] seeks to attain a
fundamental understanding of collective properties that
emerge in an ensemble of driven agents [6–9]. We explore
here a unique form of active matter based on a combination
of biological ecology [10] and robophysics [11,12]. As
autonomous robots become increasingly more adaptive, it
is interesting to ask if adaptive robot swarms can achieve
complex or dynamic behavior [13,14]. We present here a
robot swarm that emulates natural collective ensembles in
that they change their environment by their very presence,
and observe collective state changes as a consequence of
their ability to self-modify their environment and respond
to that self-modification.
Two of the innovations that distinguish our biological
ecology based robot swarms from more conventional active
matter systems [15] are the dynamic resource landscape
and how the robots self-modify the landscape. They move
over a 4.0 × 4.0 m2 light-emitting diode (LED) light board.
Each robot has four downward facing single pixel
RGB sensors in the base, which determine local light
intensities and the gradient of the resource (Fig. 1). The
sensors are at opposing quadrants on the base of the robot
and detect corresponding intensities from a 2.5 mm LED
pitch. Positions of the robots are observed by an overhead
infrared CCD camera with resolution of 800 × 800 pixels.
Each pixel of the camera sees a single 2.5 mm LED element
of the light board; thus, positions in this Letter are given
FIG. 1.

motors. (b) The four RGB sensors are used to codetect gradient
vectors from the underneath resource landscape. (c) The LED

conveniently in terms of pixel coordinates and speeds are
given in pixels/s.
Further, unlike conventional robots in a swarm, our
robots have no intrinsic motion. They move only in
response to a local self-generated light intensity gradient
∇Iðx; yÞ at their positions on the light board. Gradients in
the intensity emerge from depletion (dimming) of the local
intensity of the resource landscape by the robots. Symmetry
in the depletion hole of the local intensity Iðx; yÞ created by
a stationary robot is spontaneously broken by digitization
errors in the intensity detectors. This noise then bootstraps
up an emergent field-drive motion. Each pixel of the local
resource field shadow generated by the presence of a robot
recovers with an exponential time constant τR once the
robot moves away. The smaller τR is, the quicker the local
resource shadow recovers. Figure 2 describes this field
drive of the robots and the decaying resource shadows they
leave behind.
A swarm of many field-driven robots creates an emer-
gent complex resource field Iðx; y; tÞ which can be
extremely time and space dependent, and can be quite
difficult to simulate in order to compute actual robot
velocities [16]. The presence of many robots fjg at
positions fðxj; yjÞg on the light board gives rise to a
time-dependent 2D light intensity landscape Iðx; y; tÞ

where τR is the recovery time of a pixel intensity to the

consumption rate of a robot, σ is the radius of resource
consumption, and ΘðζÞ is a Heaviside unit step function:
Θðζ > 0Þ ¼ 1;
Θðζ ≤0Þ ¼ 0:
ð2Þ
A robot when in a position with a nonzero local resource
gradient moves in response to the gradient ∇I, usually
toward higher resources with velocity ⃗vj:
⃗vj ¼ dxj
dt ˆx þ dyj
dt ˆy ¼ κ∇Iðxj; yj; tÞ;
ð3Þ
where ˆx, ˆy are unit vectors and κ is the robotic sensitivity to
the landscape’s local resource gradient. Computation of the
magnitude of the field-drive speed of an isolated robot can
be found in Supplemental Material, Sec. 1 [17]. We also
show in Supplemental Material, Sec. 1.3, that in a suffi-
ciently weak externally imposed gradient because of the
local digging of resource holes that it is possible for a robot
to move against a resource gradient, in the “wrong”
direction. We arrive at the estimation for the maximum
resource slope S a robot can move against:
max jSj ≈0.35 kE
U ;
ð4Þ
where U ¼ σ=τR. This backward motion toward lower
resources is critical for escape from local resource maxima
which become traps due to resource hole digging.
We created heterogeneity in the robot field-drive sensi-
tivity to mimic biological heterogeneity. The N ¼ 50
robots used in these experiments have different emergent
speeds because of variability in the mechanical construc-
tion, as we show in Fig. 2(c). This heterogeneity we view as
an asset and not a bug: as in living systems but typically not
in engineered systems, heterogeneity is the rule and not the
exception.
The simplest resource landscape is a circle of light of
radius R and a single resource color, namely, “white”
(IR ¼ IG ¼ IB). In order to study how the robot swarm
behavior changed with density, we decreased the radius
RðtÞ linearly with time t:
RðtÞ ¼ Roð1 −αtÞ:

In order to provide gradients at the circle perimeter, the
perimeter is softened by a fixed Gaussian width σo ≪Ro.
The fundamental sign of the robot-robot field interaction
is negative (repulsive) due to resource competition between
two nearby robots, as shown in Fig. 3(a1). At relatively low
robot densities the robots act like a gas of self-avoiding
objects of finite size [Fig. 3(a2)]. Familiar collective
patterns emerge with increasing density, such as phenome-
non related to phase transitions in soft-matter physics [1].
Figures 3(b1)–3(d1) show that as the density increases,
varieties of interaction modes emerge among the localized
robots, thus leading to crystal, liquid, and jammed states in
sequence in overall community [Figs. 3(b2)–3(d2)].
As the robot density increases, the resource landscape
gets smoother since the average local consumption rate of
resources increases with robot density, but the recovery rate
per pixel does not. Movie 1 in Supplemental Material gives
the video of 50 robots as the circle of light shrinks [17].
Figures 3(a3)–3(e3) show the density dependent structure
function Sðkx; kyÞ [18] we get from spatial Fourier trans-
formation of robot positions as a function of robot density.
Since we can track individual robots, it is possible to
quantitatively measure the position and velocity of each
robot during a compression process. We use two different
order parameters to characterize the emergent phases: ψ6
for spatial ordering and τ for time ordering: (1) ψ6.—Since
circles close pack to a hexagonal array [19], a natural order
parameter to characterize the initial ordering of the robots
with compression is the sixfold index ψ6 [20]:
ψ6 ¼

:
ð6Þ
The value ψ6j is the local bond-orientation order parameter,
where the summation j0 runs over all Nj nearest neighbor of
robot j. θjj0 is the angle between the vector connecting
robots j to j0 and an arbitrary fixed reference axis. h·ibulk
denotes averaging over all robots excluding ones near the
boundary of the environment. We use Voronoi tessellation
[21] to define the nearness to the boundary. (2) τ.—The
time-correlated spatial dynamics of the robots, as distinct
from their time-independent spatial correlations ψ6, can be
captured by both the histogram of the robot kinetic energies
h⃗v2
ji and the dynamic four-point susceptibility order
parameter χ4 [22,23]. χ4 is calculated by first determining
the dynamical overlap function Qðt; τ; aÞ:
Qðt; τ; aÞ ¼ 1

where the vector position of robot j at time t is given by
⃗rjðtÞ ¼ xjðtÞˆx þ yjðtÞˆy;
ð8Þ
and a is a characteristic length which is usually chosen as
the radius of an agent [24]. The function χ4ðτ; aÞ is then
computed as the variance of Qðt; τ; aÞ over the quasisteady-
state time interval:
χ4ðτ; aÞ ¼ NVartðQðt; τ; aÞÞ:
ð9Þ
Figure 4(c) shows the variance of Qðt; τ; aÞ, i.e., χ4, for an
experiment. τ, as shown in Fig. 4(c), can be intuitively
viewed as the mean trapping time of a robot around a given
position.
There are three parameters which control the robot
swarm field-drive matter states: the areal density of the
robots σ and the two field relaxation processes: the

shrinking rate of the light circle α in pixels/s and the
environmental recovery time τR in seconds; see Movies 2
and 3 in Supplemental Material [17]. If τR is set too slow
and/or α is set too fast, the robots simply deplete (blacken)
the resources and all motion freezes out. This phenomenon
that we call void freezing is a new form of a glass transition,
shown in Fig. 3(e2). Remarkably, even the gas state can
directly transit to the void glass state if τR is sufficiently
slow, something that does not occur in any other forms of
active matter of which we are aware.
With decreasing values of τR for a fixed α different
phases of the field-drive matter emerge, other robot phases
emerge. With increasing compression, the robots first
freeze into a hexagonal crystalline state, with high ψ6,
high τ, and lowered h⃗v2
ji. Note that this crystalline state is
at relatively low robot densities and is not a jamming
transition [25] because the robots are not in contact with
each other, as is shown in the Supplemental Material,
Sec. 4 [17].
The transition from a gas to a crystal state, not seen in
inertially driven systems [26], emerges since our robots
have no physical inertia but rather a field-driven motion.
By “no physical inertia,” we mean that field drive
(gradient searching of resources) gives the robots motility.
In the absence of a gradient, they do not and cannot move.
If we suddenly remove the gradient, the moving robots
immediately stop by the next time step iteration. In that
sense they have no physical inertial at all. More details
can be found in Sec. 1 and Movie 4 of Supplemental
Material [17].
Because of the decreasing resource landscape roughness
with increasing robot density, the crystalline state pressure
melts into a liquid state, with a decrease in ψ6, decrease in τ,
and increase in h⃗v2
ji. Melting from a crystalline to a liquid
state, as explained in the Supplemental Material, Sec. 2.1
[17], requires robot escape from local resource minima due
to their ability in the field-drive mechanism to move against a
sufficiently weak resource gradient. Finally, the liquid state
freezes in a jammed glass as the robot field drive moves the
robots into contact with each other so that the state is
incompressible, and the field again becomes depleted
(black). The jammed state is, however, much different than
the void glass freeze: the void glass state is due to the robots
falling out of steady-state equilibrium. Figure. 5(a) shows
the result for the spatial order parameter ψ6, Fig. 5(b) gives
the kinetic energy v2 distribution of robots and Fig. 5(c)
presents the dynamical order parameter χ4 mean value τ.
Information on h⃗v2
ji with different τR can be found in Movie
5 and Sec. III in Supplemental Material [17].
Since this biologically inspired robot swarm active
matter does not have a well-defined temperature, it is

Our robot field-drive and emergent states present a
biologically inspired active matter. The robots remodel a
resource landscape and that remodeled landscape guides
the robots’ locomotion, even against resource gradients.
The field drive also generates a field-analog multibody
interaction between the robots, as we discuss in Sec. 2 of
Supplemental Material [17]; see also Refs. [27,28]. We
view robots as tools for a third way of modeling dynamical
systems, complementing theoretical ideas, digital compu-
tation, and now robophysical approaches. Thus robots (and
robophysics [11]) provide another way to develop models
of phenomena which can lead to insights in biological
systems (locomotion, resource landscape utilization) as
well as systems to explore interesting dynamics in physics
(e.g., dynamical systems, active matter), and engineers in
principle can take the robophysics insights and turn them
into more interesting robots. Hopefully with better control
and understanding of the collective robot responses, we will
uncover potentially rich, robust, and surprising phenomena
with possible connections to biology, ecology, and even
sociology [29,30].
