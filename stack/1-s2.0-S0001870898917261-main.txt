1. INTRODUCTION
This article completes in a definitive way the picture of rational map-
pings begun in [30]. It also provides new proofs for and expands upon an
earlier version [46] from the early 1980s. In the meantime the methods
and conclusions have become widely used, but rarely stated in full generality.
We hope the present treatment will provide a useful contribution to the
foundations of the field.
Let f : C C be a rational map on the Riemann sphere C , with degree
d>1, whose iterates are to be studied.
The sphere is invariantly divided into the compact Julia set J, which is
dynamically chaotic and usually fractal, and the Fatou set 0=C &J
consisting of countably many open connected stable regions each of which

is eventually periodic under forward iteration (by the main theorem of
[44]). The cycles of stable regions are of five types: parabolic, attractive
and superattractive basins; Siegel disks; and Herman rings. For completeness
we provide a fresh proof of this classification here.
The goal of this paper is to use the above picture of the dynamics to
obtain a concrete description of the Teichmu ller space of quasiconformal
deformations of f, in terms of a ``quotient Riemann surface'' (consisting of
punctured spheres and tori, and foliated disks and annuli), and the
measurable dynamics on the Julia set. This development parallels the defor-
mation theory of Kleinian groups and many features can be carried
through for other holomorphic dynamical systems.
We show the quotient Teich(C , f )Mod(C , f ) of Teichmu ller space
by its modular group of symmetries is a complex orbifold which maps
injectively into the finite-dimensional space of rational maps of degree d.
This gives another route to the no-wandering-domains theorem, and
recovers the finiteness of the number of cycles of stable regions.
It turns out that quasiconformal deformations are ubiquitous: for any
family f*(z) of rational maps parameterized by a complex manifold X, there
exists an open dense subset X0 for which each component consists of a
single quasiconformal conjugacy class. In particular, such open conjugacy
classes are dense in the space of all rational maps. We complete here the
proof of this statement begun in [30], using extensions of holomorphic
motions [47, 7].
We also complete the proof that expanding rational maps are quasi-
conformally structurally stable (these maps are also called hyperbolic or
Axiom A). Thus the Teichmu ller space introduced above provides a
holomorphic parameterization of the open set of hyperbolic rational maps
in a given topological conjugacy class. In particular the topological
conjugacy class of a hyperbolic rational map is connected, a rather
remarkable consequence of the measurable Riemann mapping theorem.
Conjecturally, these expanding rational maps are open and dense among
all rational maps of a fixed degree. We show this conjecture follows if one
can establish that (apart from classical examples associated to complex
tori), a rational map carries no measurable invariant line field on its Julia
set. The proof depends on the Teichmu ller theory developed below and the
instability of Herman rings [29].
In the last section we illustrate the general theory with the case of
quadratic polynomials.
An early version of this article [46] was circulated in preprint form
in 1983. The present work achieves the foundations of the Teichmu ller
theory of general holomorphic dynamical systems in detail, recapitulates a
self-contained account of Ahlfors' finiteness theorem (Section 4.3), the no
wandering domains theorem (Section 6.3) and the density of structurally

stable rational maps (Section 7), and completes several earlier arguments
as mentioned above.
2. STATEMENT OF RESULTS
Let f be a rational map of degree d>1. By the main result of [44],
every component of the Fatou set 0 of f maps to a periodic component 00
after a finite number of iterations. The following theorem is essentially due
to Fatou; we give a short modern proof in Section 3. That the last two
possibilities actually occur in rational dynamics depends on work of Siegel,
Arnold, and Herman.
Theorem 2.1 (Classification of Stable Regions).
A component 00 of
period p in the Fatou set of a rational map f is of exactly one of the following
five types (see Fig. 1).

HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

1.
An attractive basin: there is a point x0 in 00, fixed by f p, with
0<|( f p)$ (x0)|<1, attracting all points of 00 under iteration of f p.
2.
A superattractive basin: as above, but x0 is a critical point of f p, so
( f p)$ (x0)=0.
3.
A parabolic basin: there is a point x0 in 00 with ( f p)$ (x0)=1,
attracting all points of 00.
4.
A Siegel disk: 00 is conformably isomorphic to the unit disk, and f p
acts by an irrational rotation.
5.
A Herman ring: 00 is isomorphic to an annulus, and f p acts again
by an irrational rotation.
A conjugacy ,: C  C between two rational maps f and g is a bijection
such that , b f = g b ,. A conjugacy may be measurable, topological,
quasiconformal, conformal, etc., depending upon the quality of ,.
To describe the rational maps g quasiconformally conjugate to a given
map f, it is useful (as in the case of Riemann surfaces) to introduce the
Teichmu ller space Teich(C , f ) of marked rational maps (Section 4). This
space is provided with a natural metric and complex structure.
Our main results (Section 6) describe Teich(C , f ) as a product of three
simpler spaces:
First, there is an open subset 0dis of 0 on which f acts
discretely. The quotient 0disf=Y is a complex 1-manifold
of finite area whose components are punctured spheres or
tori, and the Teichmu ller space of Y forms one factor of
Teich(C , f ). Each component is associated to an attracting
or parabolic basin of f.
Second, there is a disjoint open set 0fol of 0 admitting a
dynamically defined foliation, for which the Teichmu ller
space of (0fol, f ) is isomorphic to that of a finite number of
foliated annuli and punctured disks. This factor comes from
Siegel disks, Herman rings and superattracting basins. Each
annulus contributes one additional complex modulus to the
Teichmu ller space of f.
Finally, there is a factor M1(J, f ) spanned by measurable
invariant complex structures on the Julia set. This factor
vanishes if the Julia set has measure zero. There is only one
class of examples for which this factor is known to be
nontrivial, namely the maps of degree n2 coming from
multiplication by n on a complex torus whose structure can
be varied (Section 9).
354
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

We sum up this description as:
Theorem 2.2 (The Teichmu ller Space of a Rational Map).
The space
Teich(C , f ) is canonically isomorphic to a connected finite-dimensional
complex manifold, which is the product of a polydisk (coming from the
foliated annuli and invariant line fields on the Julia set) and traditional
Teichmu ller spaces associated to punctured spheres and tori.
In particular, the obstruction to deforming a quasiconformal conjugacy
between two rational maps to a conformal conjugacy is measured by finitely
many complex moduli.
The modular group Mod(C , f ) is defined as QC(C , f )QC0(C , f ), the
space
of
isotopy
classes
of
quasiconformal
automorphisms
,
of
f
(Section 4). In Section 6.4 we will show:
Theorem 2.3 (Discreteness of the Modular Group). The group Mod(C , f )
acts properly discontinuously by holomorphic automorphisms of Teich(C , f ).
Let Ratd denote the space of all rational maps f : C  C of degree d. This
space can be realized as the complement of a hypersurface in projective
space P2d+1 by considering f(z)= p(z)q(z) where p and q are relatively
prime polynomials of degree d in z. The group of Mo bius transformations
Aut(C ) acts on Ratd by sending f to its conformal conjugates.
A complex orbifold is a space which is locally a complex manifold
divided by a finite group of complex automorphisms.
Corollary 2.4 (Uniformization of Conjugacy Classes).
There is a
natural holomorphic injection of complex orbifolds
Teich(C , f )Mod(C , f )  RatdAut(C )
parameterizing the rational maps g quasiconformal conjugate to f.
Corollary 2.5.
If the Julia set of a rational map is the full sphere, then
the group Mod(C , f ) maps with finite kernel into a discrete subgroup of
PSL2(R)n < Sn (the automorphism group of the polydisk).
Proof.
The Teichmu ller space of f is isomorphic to Hn.
K
Corollary 2.6 (Finiteness theorem).
The number of cycles of stable
regions of f is finite.
355
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Proof.
Let d be the degree of f. By Corollary 2.4, the complex dimension
of Teich(C , f ) is at most 2d&2. This is also the number of critical points
of f, counted with multiplicity.
By Theorem 2.2 f has at most 2d&2 Herman rings, since each
contributes at least a one-dimensional factor to Teich(C , f ) (namely
the Teichmu ller space of a foliated annulus (Section 5)). By a classical
argument, every attracting, superattracting or parabolic cycle attracts a
critical point, so there are at most 2d&2 cycles of stable regions of these
types. Finally the number of Siegel disks is bounded by 4d&4. (The proof,
which goes back to Fatou, is that a suitable perturbation of f renders at
least half of the indifferent cycles attracting; cf. [35, Section 106].)
Consequently the total number of cycles of stable regions is at most
8d&8.
K
Remark.
The sharp bound of 2d&2 (conjectured in [44]) has been
achieved by Shishikura and forms an analogue of Bers' area theorem for
Kleinian groups [39, 5].
Open Questions.
The behavior of the map Teich(C , f )Mod(C , f ) 
RatdAut(C ) (Corollary 2.4) raises many questions. For example, is this
map an immersion? When is the image locally closed? Can it accumulate
on itself like a leaf of a foliation?1
We now discuss the abundance of quasiconformally conjugate rational
maps. There are two main results. First, in any holomorphic family
of rational maps, the parameter space contains an open dense set whose
components are described by quasiconformal deformations. Second, any
two topologically conjugate expanding rational maps are in fact quasi-
conformally conjugate, and hence reside in a connected holomorphic
family.
Definitions.
Let X be a complex manifold. A holomorphic family of
rational maps parameterized by X is a holomorphic map f : X_C  C . In
other words, a family f is a rational map f*(z) defined for z # C and varying
analytically with respect to * # X.
A family of rational maps is quasiconformally constant if f: and f; are
quasiconformally conjugate for any : and ; in the same component of X.
A family of rational maps has constant critical orbit relations if any coin-
cidence f n
*(c)= f m
* (d) between the forward orbits of two critical points c
and d of f* persists under perturbation of *.
356
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN
1 The answer to this last question is yes. The Teichmu ller space of certain cubic polynomials
with one escaping critical point is dense in the Fibonacci solenoid; see [9, Section 10.2].

Theorem 2.7 (Quasiconformal Conjugacy).
A family f*(z) of rational
maps with constant critical orbit relations is quasiconformally constant.
Conversely, two quasiconformally conjugate rational maps are contained in
a connected family with constant critical orbit relations.
Corollary 2.8 (Density of Structural Stability).
In any family of
rational maps f*(z), the open quasiconformal conjugacy classes form a dense
set.
In particular, structurally stable maps are open and dense in the space Ratd
of all rational maps of degree d.
See Section 7 for discussion and proofs of these results.
Remarks.
In Theorem 2.7, the conjugacy , between two nearby maps f:
and f; can be chosen to be nearly conformal and close to the identity. The
condition ``constant critical orbit relations'' is equivalent to ``number of
attracting or superattracting cycles constant and constant critical orbit
relations among critical points outside the Julia set.''
The deployment of quasiconformal conjugacy classes in various families
(quadratic polynomials, Newton's method for cubics, rational maps of
degree two, etc.) has been the subject of ample computer experimentation
(see, e.g., [28, 12, 15] for early work in this area) and combinatorial study
([13, 10, 38], etc.).
There is another way to arrive at quasiconformal conjugacies.
Definition.
A rational map f(z) is expanding (also known as hyperbolic
or Axiom A) if any of the following equivalent conditions hold (compare
[11, Chapter V], [33, Section 3.4]).
v There is a smooth metric on the sphere such that &f $(z)&>c>1 for
all z in the Julia set of f.
v All critical points tend to attracting or superattracting cycles under
iteration.
v There are no critical points or parabolic cycles in the Julia set.
v The Julia set J and the postcritical set P are disjoint.
Here the postcritical set P/C is the closure of the forward orbits of the
critical points: i.e.,
P=[ f n(z): n>0 and f $(z)=0].
The Julia set and postcritical set are easily seen to be invariant under
topological conjugacy, so the expanding property is too.
357
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Theorem 2.9 (Topological Conjugacy).
A topological conjugacy ,0
between expanding rational maps admits an isotopy ,t through topological
conjugacies such that ,1 is quasiconformal.
Corollary 2.10.
The
set
of
rational
maps
in
Ratd
topologically
conjugate to a given expanding map f agrees with the set of rational maps
quasiconformally conjugate to f and is thus connected.
The proofs are given in Section 8.
Conjectures.
A central and still unsolved problem in conformal dynamics,
due to Fatou, is the density of expanding rational maps among all maps of
a given degree.
In Section 9 we will describe a classical family of rational maps related
to the addition law for the Weierstrass ^-function. For such maps the Julia
set (which is the whole sphere) carries an invariant line field. We then
formulate the no invariant line fields conjecture, stating that these are the
only such examples. Using the preceding Teichmu ller theory and dimension
counting, we establish:
Theorem 2.11.
The no invariant line fields conjecture implies the density
of hyperbolicity.
A version of the no invariant line fields conjecture for finitely-generated
Kleinian groups was established in [42], but the case of rational maps is
still elusive (see [34, 33] for further discussion.)
Finally in Section 10 we illustrate the general theory in the case of qua-
dratic polynomials. The well-known result of [13] that the Mandelbrot set
is connected is recovered using the general theory.
3. CLASSIFICATION OF STABLE REGIONS
Our goal in this section is to justify the description of cycles of stable
regions for rational maps. For the reader also interested in entire functions
and other holomorphic dynamical systems, we develop more general
propositions when possible. Much of this section is scattered through the
classical literature (Fatou, Julia, Denjoy, Wolf, etc.).
Definition.
A Riemann surface is hyperbolic if its universal cover is
conformally equivalent to the unit disk. Recall the disk with its conformal
geometry is the Poincare model of hyperbolic or non-Euclidean geometry.
The following is the geometric formulation of the Schwarz lemma.
358
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

Theorem 3.1.
Let f: X X be a holomorphic endomorphism of a hyper-
bolic Riemann surface. Then either
v f is a covering map and a local isometry for the hyperbolic metric, or
v f is a contraction (&df &<1 everywhere).
Under the same hypotheses, we will show:
Theorem 3.2.
The dynamics of f are described by one of the following
(mutually exclusive) possibilities.
1.
All points of X tend to infinity: namely, for any x and any compact
set K in X, there are only finitely many n>0 such that f n(x) is in K.
2.
All points of X tend towards a unique attracting fixed point x0 in X:
that is, f n(x)  x0 as n  , and | f $(x)|<1.
3.
The mapping f is an irrational rotation of a disk, punctured disk or
annulus.
4.
The mapping f is of finite order: there is an n>0 such that f n=id.
Lemma 3.3.
Let 1/Aut(H) be a discrete group of orientation-preserv-
ing hyperbolic isometries. Then either 1 is abelian, or the semigroup
End(1)=[g # Aut(H): g1g&1/1]
is discrete.
Proof.
Suppose End(1) is indiscrete, and let gn  g be a convergent
sequence of distinct elements therein. Then hn= g&1
 b gn satisfies
hn1h&1
n
/1$= g&1
 1g.
Since 1$ is discrete and hn  id, any : # 1 commutes with hn for all n suf-
ficiently large. Thus the centralizers of any two elements in 1 intersect non-
trivially, which implies they commute.
K
Proof of Theorem 3.2.
Throughout we will work with the hyperbolic
metric on X and appeal to the Schwarz lemma as stated in Theorem 3.1.
Let x be a point of X. If f n(x) tends to infinity in X, then the same is
true for every other point y, since d( f n(x), f n(y))d(x, y) for all n.
Otherwise the forward iterates f n(x) return infinitely often to a fixed
compact set K in X (i.e., f is recurrent).
If f is a contraction, we obtain a fixed point in K by the following
argument. Join x to f(x) by a smooth path : of length R. Then f n(:) is
contained infinitely often in an R-neighborhood of K, which is also
compact. Since f contracts uniformly on compact sets, the length of f n(:),
359
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

and hence d( f nx, f n+1x), tends to zero. It follows that any accumulation
point x0 of f n(x) is a fixed point. But a contracting mapping has at most
one fixed point, so f n(x)  x0 for all x.
Finally assume f is a recurrent self-covering map. If ?1(X) is abelian,
then X is a disk, punctured disk or annulus, and it is easy to check that
the only recurrent self-coverings are rotations, which are either irrational
or of finite order.
If ?1(X) is nonabelian, write X as a quotient H1 of the hyperbolic plane
by a discrete group 1$?1(X), and let gn : H  H denote a lift of f n to a
bijective isometry of the universal cover of X. Then gn # End(1), and by the
preceding lemma End(1) is discrete. Since f is recurrent the lifts gn can be
chosen to lie in a compact subset of Aut(H), and thus gn= gm for some
n>m>0. Therefore f n= f m which implies f n&m=id.
K
To handle the case in which f n(x) tends to infinity in a stable domain U,
we will need to compare the hyperbolic and spherical metrics.
Proposition 3.4.
Let
U
be
a
connected
open
subset
of
C
with
|C &U|>2 (so U is hyperbolic). Then the ratio _(z)\(z) between the spheri-
cal metric _ and the hyperbolic metric \ tends to zero as z tends to infinity
in U.
Proof.
Suppose zn # U converges to a # U. Let b and c be two other
points outside U, and let \$ be the hyperbolic metric on the triply-
punctured sphere C &[a, b, c]. Since inclusions are contracting, it suffices
to show _(zn)\$(zn) 0, and this follows from well-known estimates for
the triply-punctured sphere [2].
K
Proposition 3.5
(Fatou).
Suppose
U/C
is
a
connected
region,
f : U  U is holomorphic, f n(x)  y # U for all x # U, and f has an analytic
extension to a neighborhood of y. Then | f $( y)|<1 or f $( y)=1.
See [17, p. 242; 11, Lemma IV.2.4].
Proof of Theorem 2.1 (Classification of Stable Regions).
Let U be a
periodic component of 0. Replacing f by f p (note this does not change the
Julia or Fatou sets), we can assume f(U)=U. Since the Julia set is perfect,
U is a hyperbolic Riemann surface and we may apply Theorem 3.2. If U
contains an attracting fixed point for f then it is an attracting or super-
attracting basin. The case of an irrational rotation of a disk or annulus
gives a Siegel disk or Herman ring; note that U cannot be a punctured disk
since the puncture would not lie in the Julia set. Since the degree of f is
greater than one by assumption, no iterate of f is the identity on an open
set and the case of a map of finite order cannot arise either.
360

Orbit tending to the Julia set.
Finally we will show that U is a parabolic basin if f n(x) tends to infinity
in U.
Let : be a smooth path joining x to f(x) in U. In the hyperbolic metric
on U, the paths :n= f n(:) have uniformly bounded length (by the Schwarz
lemma). Since the ratio of spherical to hyperbolic length tends to zero at
the boundary of U, the accumulation points A/U of the path  :n form
a continuum of fixed points for f n. (See Fig. 2.) Since f n{id, the set
A=[x0] for a single fixed point x0 of f. By Fatou's result above, this fixed
point is parabolic with multiplier 1 (it cannot be attracting since it lies in
the Julia set), and therefore U is a parabolic basin.

4. THE TEICHMU LLER SPACE OF A HOLOMORPHIC
DYNAMICAL SYSTEM
In this section we will give a fairly general definition of a holomorphic
dynamical system and its Teichmu ller space. Although in this paper we are
primarily interested in iterated rational maps, it seems useful to consider
definitions that can be adapted to Kleinian groups, entire functions, corre-
spondences, polynomial-like maps and so on.
4.1. Static Teichmu ller Theory
Let X be a 1-dimensional complex manifold. For later purposes it is
important to allow X to be disconnected.2 We begin by briefly recalling the
traditional Teichmu ller space of X.
361
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III
2 On the other hand, we follow the usual convention that a Riemann surface is connected.

The deformation space Def(X) consists of equivalence classes of pairs
(,, Y) where Y is a complex 1-manifold and ,: X  Y is a quasiconformal
map; here (,, Y) is equivalent to (Z, ) if there is a conformal map
c: Y  Z such that =c b ,.
The group QC(X) of quasiconformal automorphisms |: X  X acts on
Def(X) by |((,, Y))=(, b |&1, Y).
The Teichmu ller space Teich(X) parameterizes complex structures on X
up to isotopy. More precisely, we will define below a normal subgroup
QC0(X)/QC(X) consisting of self-maps isotopic to the identity in an
appropriate sense; then
Teich(X)=Def(X)QC0(X).
To define QC0(X), first suppose X is a hyperbolic Riemann surface; then
X can be presented as the quotient X=H1 of the upper halfplane by the
action of a Fuchsian group. Let 0/S 1
=R _ [] be the complement of
the limit set of 1. The quotient X =(H _ 0)1 is a manifold with interior
X and boundary 01 which we call the ideal boundary of X (denoted ideal-X).
A continuous map |: X  X is the identity on S 1
 if there exists a lift
|~ : H H which extends to a continuous map H H pointwise fixing the
circle at infinity. Similarly, a homotopy |t : X  X, t # [0, 1] is rel S 1
 if
there is a lift |~ t : H  H which extends to a homotopy pointwise fixing S 1
.
A homotopy is rel ideal boundary if it extends to a homotopy of X
pointwise fixing ideal-X. An isotopy |t : X X is uniformly quasicon-
formal if there is a K independent of t such that |t is K-quasiconformal.
Theorem 4.1.
Let X be a hyperbolic Riemann surface and let |: X  X
be a quasiconformal map. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
1.
| is the identity on S 1
.
2.
| is homotopic to the identity rel the ideal boundary of X.
3.
| admits a uniformly quasiconformal isotopy to the identity rel ideal
boundary.
The isotopy can be chosen so that |t b #=# b |t for any automorphism # of
X such that | b #=# b |.
See [16, Theorem 1.1]. For a hyperbolic Riemann surface X, the normal
subgroup QC0(X)/QC(X) consists of those | satisfying the equivalent
conditions above.
The point of this theorem is that several possible definitions of QC0(X)
coincide. For example, the first condition is most closely related to Bers'
embedding of Teichmu ller space, while the last is the best suited to our
dynamical applications.
362
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

For a general complex 1-manifold X (possibly disconnected, with hyper-
bolic, parabolic or elliptic components), the ideal boundary of X is given
by the union of the ideal boundaries of X: over the hyperbolic components
X: of X. Then the group QC0(X) consists of those | # QC0(X) which
admit a uniformly quasiconformal isotopy to the identity rel ideal-X.
Such isotopies behave well under coverings and restrictions. For later
reference we state:
Theorem 4.2.
Let ?: X  Y be a covering map between hyperbolic
Riemann surfaces, and let |~ t : X  X be a lift of an isotopy |t : Y Y. Then
|t is an isotopy rel ideal-Y if and only if |~ t is an isotopy rel ideal-X.
Proof.
An isotopy is rel ideal boundary if and only if it is rel S 1
 [16,
Corollary 3.2], and the latter property is clearly preserved when passing
between covering spaces.
Theorem 4.3.
Let |t : X  X, t # [0, 1] be a uniformly quasiconformal
isotopy of an open set X/C . Then |t is an isotopy rel ideal-X if and only
if |t is the restriction of a uniformly quasiconformal isotopy of C pointwise
fixing C &X.
See [16, Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.4].
Teichmu ller theory extends in a natural way to one-dimensional complex
orbifolds, locally modeled on Riemann surfaces modulo finite groups; we
will occasionally use this extension below. For more details on the founda-
tions of Teichmu ller theory, see [18, 36, 23].
4.2. Dynamical Teichmu ller Theory
Definitions.
A holomorphic relation R/X_X is a countable union of
1-dimensional analytic subsets of X_X. Equivalently, there is a complex
1-manifold R and a holomorphic map
&: R  X_X
such that &(R )=R and & is injective outside a countable subset of R . The
surface R is called the normalization of R; it is unique up to isomorphism
over R [21, Vol. II]. Note that we do not require R to be locally closed.
If R is connected, we say R is irreducible.
Note.
It is convenient to exclude relations (like the constant map) such
that U_[x]/R or [x]_U/R for some nonempty open set U/X, and
we will do so in the sequel.

HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Holomorphic relations are composed by the rule
Rb S=[(x, y): (x, z) # R and (z, y) # S for some z # X],
and thereby give rise to dynamics. The transpose is defined by Rt=[(z, y):
(y, z) # R]; this generalizes the inverse of a bijection.
Examples.
The graph of a holomorphic map f : X X is a holo-
morphic relation. So is the set

In this case the normalization is given by R =C, &(z)=(ez, e- 2z).
A (one-dimensional) holomorphic dynamical system (X, R) is a collection
R of holomorphic relations on a complex 1-manifold X.

X, given locally in terms of a holomorphic coordinate z by +=+(z)dz dz
where +(z) is a measurable function and with
&+&=ess.sup
X
|+|(z)<.
Let ?1 and ?2 denote projection onto the factors of X_X, and
let &: R  R be the normalization of a holomorphic relation R on X.
A Beltrami differential + # M(X) is R-invariant if
(?1 b &)*+=(?2 b &)*+
on every component of R
where ?1 b & and ?2 b & both are nonconstant.
(A constant map is holomorphic for any choice of complex structure, so it
imposes no condition on +). Equivalently, + is R-invariant if h*(+)=+ for
every holomorphic homeomorphism h: U  V such that the graph of h is
contained in R. The invariant Beltrami differentials will turn out to be the
tangent vectors to the deformation space Def(X, R) defined below.
Let
M(X, R)=[+ # M(X): + is R-invariant for all R in R].
It is easy to see that M(X, R) is a closed subspace of M(X); let M1(X, R)
be its open unit ball.
A conjugacy between holomorphic dynamical systems (X, R) and (Y, S)

MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

Depending on the quality of ,, a conjugacy may be conformal, quasi-
conformal, topological, measurable, etc.
The deformation space Def(X, R) is the set of equivalence classes of data
(,, Y, S) where (Y, S) is a holomorphic dynamical system and ,: X  Y
is a quasiconformal conjugacy. Here (,, Y, S) is equivalent to (, Z, T) if
there is a conformal isomorphism c: Y  Z such that =c b ,. Note that
any such c is a conformal conjugacy between (Y, S) and (Z, T).
Theorem 4.4.
The map , [ ( ,,) establishes a bijection between
Def(X, R) and M1(X, R).
Proof.
Suppose (,, Y, S) # Def(X, R), and let +=( ,,). For every
holomorphic homeomorphism h: U V such that the graph of h is con-
tained in R # R, the graph of g=, b h b,&1 is contained in S=,_,(R)
# S. Since S is a holomorphic relation, g is holomorphic and therefore
h*(+)= (, b h)
(, b h)= (g b ,)
(g b ,)=+.
Thus + is R-invariant, so we have a map Def(X, R)  M1(X, R). Injectivity
of this map is immediate from the definition of equivalence in Def(X, R).
Surjectivity follows by solving the Beltrami equation (given + we can
construct Y and ,: X  Y); and by observing that for each R # R, the
normalization of S=(,_,)(R) is obtained by integrating the complex
structure (?i b &)*+ on R (for i=1 or 2).
K
Remark.
The deformation space is naturally a complex manifold,
because M1(X, R) is an open domain in a complex Banach space.
The quasiconformal automorphism group QC(X, R) consists of all quasi-
conformal conjugacies | from (X, R) to itself. Note that | may permute
the elements of R. This group acts biholomorphically on the deformation
space by
|: (,, Y, S) [ (, b|&1, Y, S).
The normal subgroup QC0(X, R) consists of those |0 admitting a
uniformly quasiconformal isotopy |t rel the ideal boundary of X, such that
|1=id and (|t_|t)(R)=R for all R # R. (In addition to requiring that
|t is a conjugacy of R to itself, we require that it induces the identity
permutation on R. Usually this extra condition is automatic because R is
countable.)
The Teichmu ller space Teich(X, R) is the quotient Def(X, R)QC0(X, R).

system (X, S) together with a marking [,] by (X, R), defined up to
isotopy through quasiconformal conjugacies rel ideal boundary.
The Teichmu ller premetric on Teich(X, R) is given by
d(([,], Y, S), ([], Z, T))= 1
2 inf log K(, b &1),
where K( } ) denotes the dilatation and the infimum is over all representatives
of the markings [,] and []. (The factor of 12 makes this metric
compatible with the norm on M(X).)
For rational maps, Kleinian groups and most other dynamical systems,
the Teichmu ller premetric is actually a metric. Here is a general criterion
that covers those cases.
Definition.
Let S be an irreducible component of a relation in the
semigroup generated by R under the operations of composition and trans-
pose. Then we say S belongs to the full dynamics of R. If S intersects the
diagonal in X_X in a countable or finite set, the points x with (x, x) # S
are fixed points of S and periodic points for R.
Theorem 4.5.
Suppose every component of X isomorphic to C (respec-
tively, C, C* or a complex torus) contains at least three (respectively, 2, 1,
or 1) periodic points for R. Then the Teichmu ller premetric on Teich(X, R)
is a metric.
Proof.
We need to obtain a conformal conjugacy from a sequence of
isotopic conjugacies n whose dilatations tend to one. For this, it suffices
to show that a sequence ,n in QC0(X, R) with bounded dilatation has a
convergent subsequence, since we can take ,n=&1
1
b n.
On the hyperbolic components of X, the required compactness follows
by basic results in quasiconformal mappings, because each ,n is isotopic to
the identity rel ideal boundary.
For the remaining components, consider any relation S in the full
dynamics generated by R. A self-conjugacy permutes the intersections of S
with the diagonal, so a map deformable to the identity through self-con-
jugacies fixes every periodic point of R. Each non-hyperbolic component is
isomorphic to C , C, C* or a complex torus, and the same compactness
result holds for quasiconformal mappings normalized to fix sufficiently
many points on these Riemann surfaces (as indicated above).
K
The modular group (or mapping class group) is the quotient
Mod(X, R)=QC(X, R)QC0(X, R);
366
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

it acts isometrically on the Teichmu ller space of (X, R). The stabilizer of
the natural basepoint (id, X, R) # Teich(X, R) is the conformal automorphism
group Aut(X, R).
Theorem 4.6.
Let R=<. Then Teich(X, R) coincides with the tradi-
tional Teichmu ller space of X.
Remarks.
We will have occasion to discuss Teichmu ller space not only
as a metric space but as a complex manifold; the complex structure (if it
exists) is the unique one such that the projection M1(X, R)  Teich(X, R)
is holomorphic.
At the end of this section we give an example showing the Teichmu ller
premetric is not a metric in general.
4.3. Kleinian Groups
The Teichmu ller space of a rational map is patterned on that of a
Kleinian group, which we briefly develop in this section (cf. [24]).
Let 1/Aut(C ) be a torsion-free Kleinian group, that is a discrete
subgroup of Mo bius transformations acting on the Riemann sphere. The
domain of discontinuity 0/C is the maximal open set such that 1 | 0 is a
normal family; its complement 4 is the limit set of 1. The group 1 acts
freely and properly discontinuously on 0, so the quotient 01 is a complex
1-manifold.
Let M1(4, 1) denote the unit ball in the space of 1-invariant Beltrami
differentials on the limit set; in other words, the restriction of M1(C , 1) to
4. (Note that M1(4, 1)=[0] if 4 has measure zero.)
Theorem 4.7.
The Teichmu ller space of (C , 1) is naturally isomorphic to
M1(4, 1)_Teich(01).
Proof.
It is obvious that
Def(C , 1)=M1(C , 1)=M1(4, 1)_M1(0, 1)
=M1(*, 1)_M1(01)=M1(*, 1)_Def(01).
Since 1 is countable and fixed points of elements of 1 are dense in
4, | | 4=id for all | # QC0(C , 1). By Theorem 4.3 above, QC0(C , 1)$
QC0(0, 1) by the restriction map, and QC0(0, 1)$QC0(01) using
Theorem 4.2. Thus the trivial quasiconformal automorphisms for the two
deformation spaces correspond, so the quotient Teichmu ller spaces are
naturally isomorphic.
367
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Corollary 4.8 (Ahlfors' Finiteness Theorem).
If 1 is finitely generated,
then the Teichmu ller space of 01 is finite-dimensional.
Proof.
Let
': Teich(C , 1)  V=Hom(1, Aut(C ))conjugation
be the map that sends (,, C , 1$) to the homomorphism \: 1 1$ deter-
mined by , b #=\(#) b,. The proof is by contradiction: if 1 is finitely
generated, then the representation variety V is finite dimensional, while if
Teich(01) is infinite dimensional, we can find a polydisk 2n/Def(C , 1)
such that 2n maps injectively to Teich(C , 1) and n>dim V. (Such a
polydisk exists because the map Def(01)  Teich(01) is a holomorphic
submersion; see, e.g., [36, Section 3.4; 23, Theorem 6.9].) The composed
mapping 2n  V is holomorphic, so its fiber over the basepoint \=id
contains a 1-dimensional analytic subset, and hence an arc. This arc
corresponds to a 1-parameter family (,t, C , 1t) in Def(C , 1) such that
1t=1 for all t. But as t varies the marking of (C , 1) changes only by a
uniformly quasiconformal isotopy, contradicting the assumption that 2n
maps injectively to Teich(C , 1).
Consequently Teich(01) is finite dimensional.
K
Remarks.
The proof above, like Ahlfors' original argument [1], can be
improved to show 01 is of finite type; that is, it is obtained from compact
complex 1-manifold by removing a finite number of points. This amounts
to showing 01 has finitely many components. For example Greenberg
shows 1 has a subgroup 1$ of finite index such that each component of
01$ contributes at least one to the dimension of Teich(01$) [20]. See
also [41].
Kleinian groups with torsion can be treated similarly (in this case 01
is a complex orbifold.)
It is known that M1(4, 1)=0 if 1 is finitely generated, or more
generally if the action of 1 on the limit set is conservative for Lebesgue
measure [42].
4.4. A counterexample
In this section we give a simple (if artificial) construction showing the
Teichmu ller premetric is not a metric in general: there can be distinct
points whose distance is zero.
For any bounded Lipschitz function f : R  R let the domain Uf /C be
the region above the graph of f:
Uf=[z=x+iy: y> f(x)].
368
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

Given two such functions f and g, the shear mapping
,f, g(x+iy)=x+i( y& f(x)+ g(y))
is a quasiconformal homeomorphism of the complex plane sending Uf to
Ug. Moreover the dilatation of ,f, g is close to one when the Lipschitz
constant of f & g is close to zero.
Let Rf be the dynamical system on C consisting solely of the identity
map on Uf. Then a conjugacy between (C, Rf) and (C, Rg) is just a map
of the plane to itself sending Uf to Ug. Therefore g determines an element
(,f, g, C, Rg) in the deformation space of (C, Rf).
A quasiconformal isotopy of conjugacies between Rf and Rg, starting at
,f, g, is given by
t(x+iy)=x+t+i( y& f(x)+ g(x+t)).
Now suppose we can find f and g and cn   such that
(a)
the Lipschitz constant of f(x)& g(x+cn) tends to zero, but
(b)
f(x){:+ g(;x+#) for any real numbers :, ; and # with ;>0.
Then the first condition implies the dilatation of t tends to one as t tends
to infinity along the sequence cn. Thus the conjugacy ,f, g can be deformed
to be arbitrarily close to conformal, and therefore the Teichmu ller
(pre)distance between Rf and Rg is zero. But condition (b) implies there is
no similarity of the plane sending Uf to Ug, and therefore Rf and Rg represent
distinct points in Teichmu ller space. (Note that any such similarity must
have positive real derivative since f and g are bounded.)
Thus the premetric is not a metric.
It only remains to construct f and g. This is easily carried out using
almost periodic functions. Let d(x) be the distance from x to the integers,
and let h be the periodic Lipschitz function h(x)=max(0, 110&d(x)).
Define
f(x)=:
p
2&ph\
x
p+
and
g(x)=:
p
2&ph\
x+ap
p +,
where p runs over the primes and where 0<ap< p2 is a sequence of
integers tending to infinity. By the Chinese remainder theorem, we can find
integers cn such that cn=&ap mod p for the first n primes. Then the
Lipschitz constant of f(x)& g(x+cn) is close to zero because after trans-
lating by cn, the first n terms in the sum for g agree with those for f. This
verifies condition (a).
By similar reasoning, f and g have the same infimum and supremum,
namely 0 and  2&p10. So if f(x)=:+;g(x+#), we must have ;=1 and
369
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

:=0. But the supremum is attained for f and not for g, so we cannot have
f(x)= g(x+#).
5. FOLIATED RIEMANN SURFACES
In contrast to the case of Kleinian groups, indiscrete groups can arise in
the analysis of iterated rational maps and other more general dynamical
systems. Herman rings provide prototypical examples. A Herman ring
(or any annulus equipped with an irrational rotation) carries a natural
foliation by circles. The deformations of this dynamical system can be
thought of as the Teichmu ller space of a foliated annulus. Because an irra-
tional rotation has indiscrete orbits, its deformations are not canonically
reduced to those of a traditional Riemann surfacealthough we will see
the Teichmu ller space of a foliated annulus is naturally isomorphic to the
upper halfplane.
More generally, we will analyze the Teichmu ller space of a complex
manifold equipped with an arbitrary set of covering relations (these include
automorphisms and self-coverings).
5.1. Foliated Annuli
Let X be an annulus of finite modulus. The Teichmu ller space of X is
infinite-dimensional, due to the presence of ideal boundary. However X
carries a natural foliation by circles, or more intrinsically by the orbits of
Aut0(X), the identity component of its automorphism group. The addition
of this dynamical system to X greatly rigidifies its structure.
To describe Teich(X, Aut0(X)) concretely, consider a specific annulus
A(R)=[z: 1<|z|<R] whose universal cover is given by A (R)=[z: 0<
Im(z)<log R], with ?1(A(R)) acting by translation by multiples of 2?.
Then Aut0(A(R))=S 1 acting by rotations, which lifts to R acting by trans-
lations on A (R). Any point in Def(A(R), S 1) is represented by (,, A(S), S 1)
for some radius S>1, and the conjugacy lifts to a map , : A (R)  A (S)
which (by virtue of quasiconformality) extends to the boundary and can be
normalized so that , (0)=0. Since , conjugates S 1 to S 1, , commutes with
real translations, and so , | R=id and , | (i+R)={+id for some complex
number { with Im({)=log S.
The group QC0(A(R), S 1) consists exactly of those |: A(R) A(R)
commuting with rotation and inducing the identity on the ideal boundary
of A(R), because by Theorem 4.1 there is a canonical isotopy of such | to
the identity through maps commuting with S 1. It follows that { uniquely
determines the marking of (A(S), S 1). Similarly elements of the modular
group Mod(A(R), S 1) are uniquely determined by their ideal boundary
values; the map z [ Rz interchanges the boundary components, and those
370
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

automorphisms preserving the boundary components are represented by
maps of the form z [ exp(2?i(%1+%2 log |z|)) z. In summary:
Theorem 5.1.
The Teichmu ller space of the dynamical system (A(R), S 1)
is naturally isomorphic to the upper half-plane H. The modular group
Mod(A(R), S 1) is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Z2 and (RZ)_R.
The map x+iy [ x+{y from A (R) to A (S) has dilatation (i&{)(i+{)
dz dz, which varies holomorphically with {. This shows:
Theorem 5.2.
The map Def(A(R), S1) Teich(A(R), S 1) is a holomorphic
submersion with a global holomorphic cross-section.
5.2. Covering Relations
More generally, we can analyze the Teichmu ller space of a set of rela-
tions defined by covering mappings.
Definition.
Let X be a Riemann surface. A relation R/X_X is a
covering relation if R=(?_?)(S) where ?: X  X is the universal covering
of X and S is the graph of an automorphism # of X .
Example.
Let f : X  Y be a covering map. Then the relation
R=[(x, x$): f(x)= f(x$)]/X_X]
is a disjoint union of covering relations. To visualize these, fix x # X; then
for each x$ such that f(x)= f(x$), the maximal analytic continuation of the
branch of f &1 b f sending x to x$ is a covering relation.
It is easy to check:
Theorem 5.3.
If R is a collection of covering relations on X, then
Teich(X, R)$Teich(X , 1),
where 1/Aut(X ) is the closure of the subgroup generated by ?1(X) and by
automorphisms corresponding to lifts of elements of R.
The case where X is hyperbolic is completed by:
Theorem 5.4.
Let 1 be a closed subgroup of Aut(H).
1.
If 1 is discrete, then
Teich(H, 1)$Teich(H1)
371
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

where H1 is a Riemann surface if 1 is torsion free, and a complex orbifold
otherwise.
2.
If 1 is one-dimensional and stabilizes a geodesic, then Teich(H, 1)
is naturally isomorphic to H.
3.
Otherwise, Teich(H, 1) is trivial (a single point).
Proof.
Let 10 be the identity component of 1. The case where 1 is
discrete is immediate, using Theorem 4.1.
Next assume 10 is one-dimensional; then 10 is a one-parameter group
of hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic transformations. Up to conformal
conjugacy, there is a unique one-parameter group of each type, and no pair
are quasiconformally conjugate. Thus any point in Teich(H, 1) has a
representative ([,], H, 1$) where 1$0=10. In particular we can assume
, # QC(H, 10).
The group 10 is hyperbolic if and only if it stabilizes a geodesic. In this
case 110 is either trivial or Z2, depending on whether 1 preserves the
orientation of the geodesic or not. The trivial case arises for the dynamical
system (A(R), S 1), which we have already analyzed; its Teichmu ller space
is isomorphic to H. The Z2 case is similar.
The group 10 is elliptic if and only if it is equal to the stabilizer
of a point p # H; in this case 10=1. Since an orientation-preserving
homeomorphism of the circle conjugating rotations to rotations is itself a
rotation, , | S 1
=# | S 1
 for some # # 1. By Theorem 4.1, , is 1-equiv-
ariantly isotopic to # rel S 1
, and so [,] is represented by a conformal
map. Therefore the Teichmu ller space is a point.
The group 10 is parabolic if and only if it has a unique fixed point p on
S 1
. We may assume p=; then 10 acts by translations. Since a
homeomorphism of R to itself normalizing the group of translations is a
similarity, we have , | S 1
=# | S 1
 where #(z)=az+b. Again, Theorem 4.1
provides an equivariant isotopy from , to # rel S 1
, so the Teichmu ller
space is a point in this case as well.
Now suppose 10 is two-dimensional. Then its commutator subgroup is
a 1-dimensional parabolic subgroup; as before, this implies , agrees with a
conformal map on S 1
 and the Teichmu ller space is trivial.
Finally, if 10 is three-dimensional then 1=Aut(H) and even the defor-
mation space of 1 is trivial.
5.3. Disjoint Unions
Let (X:, R:) be a collection of holomorphic dynamical systems, where
R: is a collection of covering relations on a complex manifolds X:. Let
`$ Teich(X:, R:)
372
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

be the restricted product of Teichmu ller spaces; we admit only sequences
([,:], Y:, S:)
whose
Teichmu ller
distances
from
([id], X:, R:)
are
uniformly bounded above.
Theorem 5.
Let (X, R) be the disjoint union of the dynamical systems
(X:, R:). Then
Teich(X, R)$`$ Teich(X:, R:).
Proof.
The product above is easily seen to be the quotient of the
restricted product of deformation spaces by the restricted product of
groups QC0(X:, R:).
There
is
one
nontrivial
point
to
verify:
that
>$ QC0(X:, R:)/
QC0(X, R). The potential difficulty is that a collection of uniformly
quasiconformal isotopies, one for each X:, need not piece together to form
a uniformly quasiconformal isotopy on X. This point is handled by
Theorem 4.1, which provides an isotopy ,:, t whose dilatation is bounded
in terms of that of ,:. The isotopy respects the dynamics by naturality:
every covering relation lifts to an automorphism of the universal cover
commuting with ,:. (An easy variant of Theorem 4.1 applies when some
component Riemann surfaces are not hyperbolic.)
Corollary 5.6.
The Teichmu ller space of a complex manifold is the
restricted product of the Teichmu ller spaces of its components.
6. THE TEICHMU LLER SPACE OF A RATIONAL MAP
Let f : C  C
be a rational map of degree d>1. By the main result
of [44], every component of the Fatou set 0 of f is preperiodic, so it
eventually lands on a cyclic component of one of the five types classified
in Theorem 2.1. In this section we describe the Teichmu ller space of (C , f )
as a product of factors from these cyclic components and from invariant
complex structures on the Julia set. We will also describe a variant of the
proof of the no wandering domains theorem.
6.1. Self-Covering Maps
Let f : X  X be a holomorphic endomorphism of a complex 1-manifold.
To simplify notation, we will use f both to denote both the map and the
dynamical system consisting of a single relation, the graph of f.
Definitions.
The grand orbit of a point x # X is the set of y such that
f n(x)= f m(y) for some n, m0. We denote the grand orbit equivalence
373
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

relation by xt y. If f n(x)= f n( y) for some n0 then we write xr y and
say x and y belong to the same small orbit.
The space Xf is the quotient of X by the grand orbit equivalence
relation. This relation is discrete if all orbits are discrete; otherwise it is
indiscrete.
In preparation for the analysis of rational maps, we first describe the
case of a self-covering.
Theorem 6.1.
Assume every component of X is hyperbolic, f is a covering
map and Xf is connected.
1.
If the grand orbit equivalence relation of f is discrete, then Xf is a
Riemann surface or orbifold, and
Teich(X, f )$Teich(Xf ).
2.
If the grand orbit equivalence relation is indiscrete, and some com-
ponent A of X is an annulus of finite modulus, then
Teich(X, f )$Teich(A, Aut0(A))$H.
3.
Otherwise, the Teichmu ller space of (X, f ) is trivial.
Proof.
First suppose X has a component A which is periodic of period
p. Then Teich(X, f )$Teich(A, f p). Identify the universal cover of A with
H, and let 1 be the closure of the group generated by ?1(A) and a lift of
f p. It is easy to see that 1 is discrete if and only if the grand orbits of f
are discrete, which implies Xf$H1 and case 1 of the Theorem holds.
If 1 is indiscrete, then A is a disk, a punctured disk or an annulus and f p
is an irrational rotation, by Theorem 3.2; then cases 2 and 3 follow by
Theorem 5.4.
Now suppose X has no periodic component. If the grand orbit relation
is discrete, case 1 is again easily established. So assume the grand orbit
relation is indiscrete; then X has a component A with nontrivial fundamental
group. We have Teich(X, f )$Teich(A, R) where R is the set of covering
relations arising as branches of f &n b f n for all n. The corresponding group
1 is the closure of the union of discrete groups 1n $?1( f n(A)). Since 1 is
indiscrete, 1 is abelian and therefore 1-dimensional, by a variant of
Lemma 3.3.
Thus 1 stabilizes a geodesic if and only if ?1(A) stabilizes a geodesic,
giving case 2; otherwise, by Theorem 5.4, the Teichmu ller space is
trivial.

6.2. Rational Maps
Now let f : C C be a rational map of degree d>1.
The superattracting basins, Siegel disks and Herman rings of a rational
map are canonical foliated by the components of the closures of the grand
orbits. In the Siegel disks, Herman rings, and near the superattracting
cycles, the leaves of this foliation are real-analytic circles. In general coun-
tably many leaves may be singular.
Let J be closure of the grand orbits of all periodic points and all critical
points of f. By Theorem 2.1, it is easy to see that J is the union of:
1.
The Julia set of f;
2.
The grand orbits of the attracting and superattracting cycles and
the centers of Siegel disks (a countable set); and
3.
The leaves of the canonical foliations which meet the grand orbit
of the critical points (a countable union of one-dimensional sets).
Let 0 =C &J /0. Then f : 0  0
is a covering map without periodic
points.
Let 0 =0dis ? 0fol denote the partition into open sets where the grand
orbit equivalence relation is discrete and where it is indiscrete. In other
words, 0dis contains the points which eventually land in attracting or
parabolic basins, while 0fol contains those which land in Siegel disks,
Herman rings and superattracting basins.
Parallel to Theorem 4.7 for Kleinian groups, we have the following result
for rational maps:
Theorem 6.2.
The Teichmu ller space of a rational map f of degree d is
naturally isomorphic to
M1(J, f )_Teich(0fol, f )_Teich(0disf ),
where 0disf is a complex manifold.
Here M1(J, f ) denotes the restriction of M1(C , f ) to J.
Proof.
Since J contains a dense countable dynamically distinguished
subset, |J =id for all | # QC0(C , f ), and so
QC0(C , f )=QC0(0fol, f )_QC0(0dis, f )
by Theorem 4.3. This implies the theorem with the last factor replaced by
Teich(0dis, f ), using the fact that J and J differ by a set of measure zero.
To complete the proof, write 0dis as  0dis
i , a disjoint union of totally
375
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

invariant open sets such that each quotient 0dis
i f is connected. Then by
Theorems 5.5 and 6.1, we have
Teich(0dis, f )=`$ Teich(0dis
i , f )=`$ Teich(0dis
i f )=Teich(0disf ).
Note that 0disf is a complex manifold (rather than an orbifold), because
f | 0dis has no periodic points.

Next we give a more concrete description of the factors above.
Theorem 6.3.
The quotient space 0disf is a finite union of Riemann
surfaces, one for each cycle of attractive or parabolic components of the
Fatou set of f.
An attractive basin contributes an n-times punctured torus to 0disf, while
a parabolic basin contributes an n+2-times punctured sphere, where n1 is
the number of grand orbits of critical points landing in the corresponding
basin.
Proof.
Every component of 0dis is preperiodic, so every component X
of 0disf can be represented as the quotient Yf p, where Y is obtained from
a parabolic or attractive basin U of period p be removing the grand orbits
of critical points and periodic points.
First suppose U is attractive. Let x be the attracting fixed point of f p in
U, and let *=( f p)$(x). After a conformal conjugacy if necessary, we can
assume x # C. Then by classical results, there is a holomorphic linearizing
map
(z)=lim *&n( f pn(z)&x)
mapping U onto C, injective near x and satisfying ( f p(z))=*((z)).
Let U$ be the complement in U of the grand orbit of x. Then the space
of grand orbits in U$ is isomorphic to C*(z [ *z), a complex torus.
Deleting the points corresponding to critical orbits in U$, we obtain Yf p.
Now suppose U is parabolic. Then there is a similar map : U  C such
that ( f p(z))=z+1, exhibiting C as the small orbit quotient of U. Thus
the space of grand orbits in U is the infinite cylinder C(z [ z+1)$C*.
Again deleting the points corresponding to critical orbits in U, we obtain
Yf p.
In both cases, the number n of critical orbits to be deleted is at least one,
since the immediate basin of an attracting or parabolic cycle always
contains a critical point. Thus the number of components of 0disf is bounded
by the number of critical points, namely 2d&2.
K
For a detailed development of attracting and parabolic fixed points, see,
e.g., [11, Chapter II].

Lemma 6.4.
Let 2n/Def(C , f ) be a polydisk mapping injectively to the
Teichmu ller space of f. Then n2d&2=dim Ratd, where d is the degree of f.
Proof.
Let
': Def(C , f )  V=RatdAut(C )
be the holomorphic map which sends (,, C , g) to g, a rational map deter-
mined up to conformal conjugacy. The space of such rational maps is a
complex orbifold V of dimension 2d&2. If n>2d&2, then the fibers of the
map 2n  V are analytic subsets of positive dimension; hence there is an
arc (,t, g0) in 2n lying over a single map g0. But as t varies, the marking
of g0 changes only by a uniformly quasiconformal isotopy, contradicting
the assumption that 2n maps injectively to Teich(C , 1).
K
Definition.
An invariant
line field on a positive-measure totally
invariant subset E of the Julia set is the choice of a real 1-dimensional
subspace Le /LeC , varying measurably with respect to e # E, such that f $
transforms Le to Lf(e) for almost every e # E.
Equivalently, an invariant line field is given by a measurable Beltrami
differential + supported on E with |+|=1 such that f *+=+. The corre-
spondence is given by Le=[v # TeC : +(v)=1 or v=0].
Theorem 6.5.
The space M1(J, f ) is a finite-dimensional polydisk,
whose dimension is equal to the number of ergodic components of the
maximal measurable subset of J carrying an invariant line field.
Proof.
The space M1(J, f ) injects into Def(C , f ) (by extending + to be
zero on the Fatou set), so M1(J, f ) is finite-dimensional by the preceding
Lemma. The line fields with ergodic support form a basis for M(J, f ).
K
Corollary 6.6.
On the Julia set there are finitely many positive
measure ergodic components outside of which the action of the tangent map
of f is irreducible.
Definitions.
A critical point is acyclic if its forward orbit is infinite.
Two points x and y in the Fatou set are in the same foliated equivalence
class if the closures of their grand orbits agree. For example, if x and y are
on the same leaf of the canonical foliation of a Siegel disk, then they lie in
a single foliated equivalence class. On the other hand, if x and y belong to
an attracting or parabolic basin, then to lie in the same foliated equivalence
class they must have the same grand orbit.
377
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Theorem 6.7.
The space Teich(0fol, f ) is a finite-dimensional polydisk,
whose dimension is given by the number of cycles of Herman rings plus the
number of foliated equivalence classes of acyclic critical points landing in
Siegel disks, Herman rings or superattracting basins.
Proof.
As for 0dis, we can write 0fol= 0fol
i , a disjoint union of totally
invariant open sets such that 0fol
i f is connected for each i. Then
Teich(0fol, f )=`$ Teich(0fol
i , f ),
and by Theorem 6.1 each factor on the right is either a complex disk or
trivial. By Theorem 5.2, each disk factor can be lifted to Def(C , f ), so
by Lemma 6.4 the number of disk factors is finite. A disk factor arises
whenever 0fol
i
has an annular component. A cycle of foliated regions with
n critical leaves gives n periodic annuli in the Siegel disk case, n+1 in the
case of a Herman ring, and n wandering annuli in the superattracting case.
If two critical points account for the same leaf, then they lie in the same
foliated equivalence class.
K
Theorem 6.8 (Number of Moduli).
The dimension of the Teichmu ller
space of a rational map is given by n=nAC+nHR+nLF&nP, where
v nAC is the number of foliated equivalence classes of acyclic critical
points in the Fatou set,
v nHR is the number of cycles of Herman rings,
v nLF is the number of ergodic line fields on the Julia set, and
v nP is the number of parabolic cycles.
Proof.
The Teichmu ller space of an n-times punctured torus has dimension
n, while that of an n+2-times punctured sphere has dimension n&1. Thus the
dimension of Teich(0disf ) is equal to the number of grand orbits of acyclic
critical points in 0dis, minus nP. We have just seen the number of remaining
acyclic critical orbits (up to foliated equivalence), plus nHR, gives the dimension
of Teich(0fol, f ). Finally nLF is the dimension of M1(J, f ).
K
6.3. No Wandering Domains
A wandering domain is a component 00 of the Fatou set 0 such that the
forward iterates f i(00); i>0 are disjoint. The main result of [44] states:
Theorem 6.9.
The Fatou set of a rational map has no wandering domain.
Here is another proof, using the results above.
Lemma 6.10 (Baker).
If f has a wandering domain 00, then f n(00) is a
disk for all n sufficiently large.
378
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

A simple geometric proof of this Lemma was found by Baker in 1983 (as
described in the last paragraph of [6]). The result also appears in [4, 11,
and 3].
Proof of Theorem 6.9.
By the Lemma, if f has a wandering domain
then it has a wandering disk 00. For all n large enough, f n(00) contains
no critical points, so it maps bijectively to f n+1(00). Thus the Riemann
surface 0disf has a component X which is a finitely punctured disk. (One
puncture appears for each grand orbit containing a critical point and passing
through 00.) But the Teichmu ller space of X is infinite dimensional,
contradicting the finite-dimensionality of the Teichmu ller space of f.
K
6.4. Discreteness of the Modular Group
Proof of Theorem 2.3 (Discreteness of the Modular group).
The group
Mod(C , f ) acts isometrically on the finite-dimensional complex manifold
Teich(C , f ) with respect to the Teichmu ller metric. The stabilizer of a point
([,], C , g) is isomorphic to Aut(g) and hence finite; thus the quotient
of Mod(C , f ) by a finite group acts faithfully. By compactness of quasi-
conformal maps with bounded dilatation, Mod(C , f ) maps to a closed
subgroup of the isometry group; thus Mod(C , f ) is a Lie group. If
Mod(C , f ) has positive dimension, then there is an arc (,t, C , f ) of
inequivalent markings of f in Teichmu ller space; but such an arc can be lifted
to the deformation space, which implies each ,t is in QC0( f ) (just as in the
proof of Lemma 6.4), a contradiction.
Therefore Mod(C , f ) is discrete.
K
Remark.
Equivalently, we have shown that for any K>1, there are
only a finite number of nonisotopic quasiconformal automorphisms of f
with dilatation less than K.
7. HOLOMORPHIC MOTIONS AND QUASICONFORMAL
CONJUGACIES
Definitions.
Let X be a complex manifold. A holomorphic family of
rational maps f*(z) over X is a holomorphic map X_C  C , given by
(*, z) [ f*(z).
Let X top/X be the set of topologically stable parameters. That is,
: # X top if and only if there is a neighborhood U of : such that f: and f;
are topologically conjugate for all ; # U.3
379
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III
3 In the terminology of smooth dynamics, these are the structurally stable parameters
relative to the family X.

The space X qc/X top of quasiconformally stable parameters is defined
similarly, except the conjugacy is required to be quasiconformal.
Let X0 /X be the set of parameters such that the number of critical
points of f* (counted without multiplicity) is locally constant. For * # X0
the critical points can be locally labeled by holomorphic functions
c1(*), ..., cn(*). Indeed, X0 is the maximal open set over which the projec-
tion C X is a covering space, where C is variety of critical points
[(*, c) # X_C : f$*(c)=0].
A critical orbit relation of f* is a set of integers (i, j, a, b) such that
f a(ci(*))= f b(cj(*)); here a, b0.
The set X post/X0 of postcritically stable parameters consists of those *
such that the set of critical orbit relations is locally constant. That is,
* # X post if any coincidence between the forward orbits of two critical
points persists under a small change in *. This is clearly necessary for
topologically stability, so X top/X post.
The main result of this section is the following.
Theorem 7.1.
In any holomorphic family of rational maps, the topologi-
cally stable parameters are open and dense.
Moreover the structurally stable, quasiconformally stable and postcritically
stable parameters coincide (X top=X qc=X post).
This result was anticipated and nearly established in [30, Theorem D].
The proof is completed and streamlined here using the Harmonic *-Lemma
of Bers and Royden.
7.1. Holomorphic Motions
Definition.
A holomorphic motion of a set A/C
over a connected
complex manifold with basepoint (X, x) is a mapping ,: X_A C , given
by (*, a) [ ,*(a), such that:
1.
For each fixed a # A, ,*(a) is a holomorphic function of *;
2.
For each fixed * # X, ,*(a) is an injective function of a; and
3.
The injection is the identity at the basepoint (that is, ,x(a)=a).
We will use two fundamental results about holomorphic motions:
Theorem 7.2 (The *-Lemma).
A holomorphic motion of A has a unique
extension to a holomorphic motion of A . The extended motion gives a con-
tinuous map ,: X_A C . For each *, the map ,* : A C
extends to a
quasiconformal map of the sphere to itself.
380
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

See [30]; the final statement appears in [7].
Definition.
Let U/C
be an open set with |C &U|>2. A Beltrami
coefficient + on U is harmonic if locally
+=+(z) dz
dz=8
\2= 8 (z) dz 2
\(z)2 dz dz ,
where 8(z) dz2 is a holomorphic quadratic differential on U and \2 is the
area element of the hyperbolic (or Poincare ) metric on U.
Theorem 7.3 (The Harmonic *-Lemma).
Let
,: 2_A  C
be a holomorphic motion over the unit disk, with |A|>2. Then there is a
unique holomorphic motion of the whole sphere
, : 2(13)_C  C ,
defined over the disk of radius 13 and agreeing with , on their common
domain of definition, such that the Beltrami coefficient of , *(z) is harmonic
on C &A for each *.
Remarks.
The Harmonic *-Lemma is due to BersRoyden [7]. The
extension it provides has the advantage of uniqueness, which will be used
below to guarantee compatibility with dynamics. For other approaches to
extending holomorphic motions, see [47] and [40]. These motions are the
main tool in our construction of conjugacies.
Definition.
Let f*(z) be a holomorphic family of rational maps over
(X, x). A holomorphic motion respects the dynamics if it is a conjugacy:
that is, if
,*( fx(a))= f*(,*(a))
whenever a and fx(a) both belong to A.
Theorem 7.4.
For any x # X post, there is a neighborhood U of x and a
holomorphic motion of the sphere over (U, x) respecting the dynamics.
Proof.
Choose a polydisk neighborhood V of x in X post. Then over V
the critical points of f* can be labeled by distinct holomorphic functions
ci(*). In other words,
[c1(*), ..., cn(*)]
defines a holomorphic motion of the critical points of fx over V.
381
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

The condition of constant critical orbit relations is exactly what we need
to extend this motion to the forward orbits of the critical points. That is,
if we specify a correspondence between the forward orbits of the critical
points of fx and f* by
f a
x(ci(x)) [ f a
*(ci(*)),
the mapping we obtain is well-defined, injective, and depends holomorphi-
cally on *.
Next, we extend this motion to the grand orbits of the critical points.
There is a unique extension compatible with the dynamics. Indeed,
consider a typical point where the motion has already been defined, say by
q(*). Let
Z=[(*, p): f*( p)=q(*)]/V_C w
? V
be the graph of the multivalued function f &1
* (q(*)). If q(*) has a preimage
under f* which is a critical point ci(*), then this critical point has constant
multiplicity and the graph of ci forms one component of Z. The remaining
preimages of q(*) have multiplicity one, and therefore ?&1(*) has constant
cardinality as * varies in V. Consequently Z is a union of graphs of single-
valued functions giving a holomorphic motion of f &1
x (q(x)).
The preimages of q(*) under f n
x are treated similarly, by induction on n,
giving a holomorphic motion of the grand orbits compatible with the
dynamics.
By the *-lemma, this motion extends to one sending P (x) to P (*), where
P (*) denotes the closure of the grand orbits of the critical points of f*.
If |P (x)|2, then f* is conjugate to z [ zn for all * # V; the theorem is
easy in this special case. Otherwise P (x) contains the Julia set of fx, and
its complement is a union of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces.
To conclude the proof, we apply the BersRoyden Harmonic *-lemma to
extend the motion of P (x) to an unique motion ,*(z) of the whole sphere,
such that the Beltrami coefficient +*(z) of ,*(z) is harmonic on C &P (x).
This motion is defined on a polydisk neighborhood U of x of one-third the
size of V.
For each * in U the map
f* : (C &P (*))  (C &P (*))
is a covering map. Define another extension of the motion to the whole
sphere by
*(z)= f &1
*
b ,* b fx(z),
382
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

where z # C &P (x) and the branch of the inverse is chosen continuously so
that x(z)=z. (On P (x) we set leave the motion the same, since it already
respects the dynamics).
The rational maps f* and fx are conformal, so the Beltrami coefficient
of * is simply f *x(+*). But fx is a holomorphic local isometry for the hyper-
bolic metric on C &P (x), so it pulls back harmonic Beltrami differentials
to harmonic Beltrami differentials. By uniqueness of the BersRoyden
extension, we have *=,*, and consequently the motion , respects the
dynamics.
K
Corollary 7.5.
The postcritically stable, quasiconformally stable and
topologically stable parameters coincide.
Proof.
It is clear that X qc/X top/X post. By the preceding theorem, if
x # X post then for all * in a neighborhood of x we have ,* b f*= fx b ,*,
where ,*(z) is a holomorphic motion of the sphere. By the *-lemma, ,*(z)
is quasiconformal, so X post/X qc.
K
Remark.
The monodromy of holomorphic motions in non-simply con-
nected families of rational maps can be quite interesting; see [31, 32, 19, 8,
9].
7.2. Density of Structural Stability
The completion of the proof of density of topological stability will use
the
notion
of
J-stability
developed
by
Man~ e ,
Sad,
and
Sullivan.
Theorems 7.6 and 7.7 below are from [30]; see also [33, Section 4; 27].
Theorem 7.6.
Let f*(z) be a holomorphic family of rational maps over
X. Then the following conditions on a parameter x # X are equivalent.
1.
The total number of attracting and superattracting cycles of f* is
constant on a neighborhood of x.
2.
Every periodic point of fx is attracting, repelling or persistently
indifferent.
3.
The is a neighborhood (U, x) over which the Julia set Jx admits a
holomorphic motion compatible with the dynamics.
Here a periodic point z of fx of period p is persistently indifferent if there
is a holomorphic map w: U  C defined on a neighborhood of x such that
f p
*(w(*))=w(*) and |( f p
*)$(w(*))|=1 for all * # U.
Definition.
The x # X such that the above conditions hold form the
J-stable parameters of the family f*(z).
383
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Theorem 7.7.
The J-stable parameters are open and dense.
Proof.
The local maxima of N(*)=(the number of attracting cycles of
f*) are open and dense (since N(*)2d&2) and equal to X stable by the
preceding result.
K
The next result completes the proof of Theorem 7.1.
Theorem 7.8.
The postcritically stable parameters are open and dense in
the set of J-stable parameters.
Remark.
A similar result was established in [30].
Proof.
Using Corollary 7.5, we have X post/X stable because X post=X top
and topological conjugacy preserves the number of attracting cycles. By
definition X post is open, so it only remains to prove it is dense in X stable.
For convenience, we first pass to the subset X0 /X stable where two
additional conditions hold:
(a)
every superattracting cycle is persistently superattracting, and
(b)
the number of critical points of f* is locally maximized.
Then X0 is the complement of a proper complex analytic subvariety of
X stable, so it is open and dense.
Let U be an arbitrary polydisk in X0, and label the critical points of f*
by ci(*), i=1, ..., n where ci : U  C are holomorphic maps.
We will show that for each i and j, there is an open dense subset of U
on which the critical orbit relations between ci and cj are locally constant.
Since the intersection of a finite number of open and dense sets is open and
dense, this will complete the proof.
Because U/X stable, any critical point in the Julia set remains there as
the parameter varies, and the holomorphic motion of the Julia respects the
labeling of the critical points. (Indeed f: J  J is locally m-to-1 at a point
z # J if and only if z is a critical point of multiplicity m&1; compare [33,
Section 4]). Thus the critical orbit relations are constant for critical points
in the Julia set; so we will assume ci and cj both lie in the Fatou set.
For a, b0, with a{b if i= j, consider the critical orbit relation:
f a
*(ci(*))= f b
*(cj(*)).
(V)
Let Uij /U be the set of parameters where no relation of the form (V)
holds for any a, b. If Uij=U we are done. If Uij is empty, then (by the Baire
category theorem), some relation of the form (V) holds on an open subset
of U, and hence throughout U. It is easy to verify that all relations between
ci and cj are constant in this case as well.
384
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

In the remaining case, there are a, b0 and a *0 # U such that (V) holds,
but (V) fails outside a proper complex analytic subvariety of U. To
complete the proof, we will show *0 is in the closure of the interior of Uij.
In other words, we will find an open set of small perturbations of *0 where
there are no relations between the forward orbits of ci and cj.
First consider the case where i= j. Since the Julia set moves continuously
over U and periodic cycles do not change type, there is natural corre-
spondence between components of the Fatou set of f* as * varies. This
correspondence preserves the types of periodic components as classified by
Theorem 2.1 (using the fact that superattracting cycles are persistently
superattracting over X0).
We may assume ci lands in an attracting or superattracting basin, or in
a Siegel disk, since (V) cannot hold in a Herman ring or in a parabolic
basin. Thus f a
*0(ci(*0)) lands on the corresponding attracting, superattracting
or indifferent cycle. In the attracting and superattracting cases, the critical
point is asymptotic to this cycle (but not equal to it) for all * sufficiently
close to *0 but outside the variety where (V) holds. In the Siegel disk case,
f a
*(ci(*)) lies in the Siegel disk but misses its center when (V) fails, implying
its forward orbit is infinite in this case as well. Thus *0 is in the closure of
the interior of Uii, as desired.
Now we treat the case i{ j. Since we have already shown that the self-
relations of a critical point are constant on an open dense set, we may
assume ci and cj have constant self-relations on U. Then if ci has a finite
forward orbit for one (and hence all) parameters in U, so does cj (by (V)),
and they both land in the same periodic cycle when *=*0. Since each
periodic cycle moves holomorphically over U, (V) holds on all of U and we
are done.
So henceforth we assume ci and cj have infinite forward orbits for all
parameters in U. Increasing a and b if necessary, we can assume the point
p= f a
*0(ci(*0))= f b
*0(cj(*0))
lies in a periodic component of the Fatou set. If this periodic component
is an attracting, superattracting or parabolic basin, we may assume that p
lies close to the corresponding periodic cycle.
In the attracting and parabolic cases, we claim there is a ball B contain-
ing p such that for all * sufficiently close to *0, the sets
( f n
*(B): n=0, 1, 2, ...)
are disjoint and f n
* | B is injective for all n>0. This can be verified using the
local models of attracting and parabolic cycles. Now for * near *0 but
outside the subvariety where (V) holds, f a
*(ci(*)) and f b
*(cj(*)) are distinct
385
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

points in B. Thus ci(*) and cj(*) have disjoint forward orbits and we have
shown *0 is in the closure of the interior of Uij.
In the superattracting case, this argument breaks down because we
cannot obtain injectivity of all iterates of f* on a neighborhood of p.
Instead, we will show that near *0, ci and cj lie on different leaves of the
canonical foliation of the superattracting basin, and therefore have distinct
grand orbits.
To make this precise, choose a local coordinate with respect to which the
dynamics takes the form Z [ Zd. More precisely, if the period of the super-
attracting cycle is k, let Z*(z) be a holomorphic function of (*, z) in a
neighborhood of (*0, p), which is a homeomorphism for each fixed * and
which satisfies
Z*( f k
*(z))=Zd
*(z).
(The existence of Z follows from classical results on superattracting cycles;
cf. [11, Section II.4].) Since (V) does not hold throughout U, there is a
neighborhood V of *0 on which
Z*( f a
*(ci(*))){Z*( f b
*(cj(*)))
unless *=*0. Note too that neither quantity vanishes since each critical
point has an infinite forward orbit. Shrinking V if necessary we can assume
|Z*( f a
*(ci(*)))| d<|Z*( f b
*(cj(*)))|<|Z*( f a
*(ci(*)))| 1d
for * # V. If we remove from V the proper real-analytic subset where
|Z*( f a
*(ci(*)))|=|Z*( f b
*(cj(*)))|,
we obtain an open subset of Uij with *0 in its closure. (Here we use the fact
that two points where log log(1|Z|) differs by more than zero and less
than log d cannot be in the same grand orbit.)
Finally we consider the case of a Siegel disk or Herman ring of period
k. In this case, for all * # U, the forward orbit of ci(*) determines a dense
subset of Ci(*), a union of k invariant real-analytic circles. This dynami-
cally labeled subset moves injectively as * varies, so the *-lemma gives a
holomorphic motion
,: U_Ci(*0)  C ,
which respects the dynamics. For each fixed *, ,*(z) is a holomorphic
function of z as well, since f* is holomorphically conjugate to a linear
rotation in domain and range.
386
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

By assumption, f b
*(cj(*) # Ci(*) when *=*0. If this relation holds on an
open subset V of U, then
g(*)=,&1
* ( f b
*(cj(*)))
is a holomorphic function on V with values in Ci(*0), hence constant. It
follows that (V) holds on V, and hence on all of U and we are done.
Otherwise, ci(*) and cj(*) have disjoint forward orbits for all * outside the
proper real-analytic subset of U where f b
*(cj(*)) # Ci(*).
K
From the proof we have a good qualitative description of the set of
points that must be removed to obtain X top from X stable.
Corollary 7.9.
The set X stable is the union of the open dense subset
X top and a countable collection of proper complex and real-analytic
subvarieties. Thus X top has full measure in X stable.
The real-analytic part occurs only when f* has a foliated region (a Siegel
disk, Herman ring, or a persistent superattracting basin) for some * # X stable.
Remark.
On the other hand, Rees has shown that X stable need not have
full measure in X [37].
Corollary 7.10.
If X is a connected J-stable family of rational maps
with no foliated regions, then X post is connected and ?1(X post) maps surjec-
tively to ?1(X).
Proof.
The complement X&X post is a countable union of proper complex
subvarieties, which have codimension two.
K
8. HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL MAPS
In this section we show that two topologically conjugate hyperbolic
rational maps are quasiconformally conjugate.
Proof of Theorem 2.9 (Topological conjugacy).
The stable regions of
an expanding (alias hyperbolic) rational map are either attracting or super-
attracting basins. Let ,: C  C
be a topological conjugacy between two
expanding maps f1 and f2. We will deform , to a quasiconformal con-
jugacy.
The map , preserves the extended Julia set J and the regions 0dis and
0fol introduced in Section 6 because these are determined by the topologi-
cal dynamics. Thus , descends to a homeomorphism ,
between the
Riemann surfaces 0dis
1 f1 and 0dis
2 f2. These surfaces are finite unions of
punctured tori. By standard surface topology we may deform , through an
387
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

isotopy , t to a quasiconformal map between these surfaces. (Indeed, after
deformation we can arrange that the mapping is the restriction of a smooth
map between closed tori.) Lifting this deformation, we obtain an isotopy of
,t : 0dis
1  0dis
2 , starting at , and respecting the dynamics for all t.
It is easy to see this isotopy converges to the trivial deformation along
the grand orbits of the periodic points and critical points in the attracting
regions. We claim it also converges to the trivial deformation along the
Julia set. Indeed, the hyperbolic property implies each map is expanding
with respect to some conformal metric near the Julia set. Thus pulling back
the deformation by f &n
i
contracts it exponentially, so the limiting deforma-
tion is trivial.
We have arrived at a deformation of our conjugacy which is trivial on the
Julia set and which renders the conjugacy quasiconformal on 0dis. A similar
argument may be employed to deform the conjugacy on the superattractive
regions to get quasiconformality on 0fol. (By taking care to preserve circular
symmetry, an isotopy defined on a single annulusor punctured disk component
of 0fol extends equivariantly to the entire grand orbit.)
By well-known removability results, a homeomorphism which is quasicon-
formal except on a closed countable union of isolated points and real-analytic
arcs is globally quasiconformal [26, Section I.8.3]. Thus at the conclusion
of the isotopy we obtain a conjugacy  which is quasiconformal on the
entire Fatou set 0.
Finally we claim  is quasiconformal on the Julia set. Consider a small
circle C centered at a point x # J( f1) (Fig. 3). By the distortion lemma for
expanding conformal maps [43], as long as an iterate f n
1(C) remains close
to the Julia set, f n
1 distorts ratios of distances between points in C by a
bounded amount (it is a quasi-similarity). In particular, the ratio between
the inradius and outradius of f n
1(C) about f n
1(x) is bounded independent of C.
Fig. 3.
Proof of quasiconformality of .

MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

By the expanding property, we can also choose n large enough that
f n
1(C) has definite diameter. Then its image under  is still has a bounded
ratio of inradius to outradius. Since  is a conjugacy,
 b f n
1(C)= f n
2 b (C).
Applying the distortion lemma once more, we conclude that (C) has a
bounded ratio of inradius to outradius, because it maps with bounded
distortion under f n
2 to ( f n
1(C)). Thus the circular dilatation of  is
bounded on the Julia set, and therefore  is quasiconformal on the whole
sphere.
K
Remark.
In
the proof
above,
the
Koebe
distortion
theorem for
univalent functions can be used in place of the distortion theorem for
expanding maps. (One then appeals to the property J( f ) & P( f )=< to
construct univalent inverses near the Julia set.)
9. COMPLEX TORI AND INVARIANT LINE FIELDS ON
THE JULIA SET
A central problem in conformal dynamics is to settle:
Conjecture 9.1 (Density of Hyperbolicity).
The hyperbolic rational
maps are open and dense among all rational maps of a given degree.
In this section we formulate a conjecture about the ergodic theory of a
single rational map which implies the density of hyperbolicity.
Let X=C4 be a complex torus; then X also has a group structure
coming from addition on C. Let ^: X  C be a degree two holomorphic
map to the Riemann sphere such that ^(&z)=^(z); such a map is unique
up to automorphisms of C and can be given by the Weierstrass ^-function.
Let F: X  X be the endomorphism F(z)=nz for some integer n>1.
Since n(&z)=&(nz), there is a unique rational map f on the sphere such
that the diagram
C4 ww

commutes. (Compare [25].)

HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

Definition.
A rational map f is double covered by an integral torus
endomorphism if it arises by the above construction.
It is easy to see that repelling periodic points of F are dense on the torus,
and therefore the Julia set of f is equal to the whole sphere. Moreover, F
and z [ &z preserve the line field tangent to geodesics of a constant slope
on X (or more formally, the Beltrami differential +=dz dz), and therefore
f has an invariant line field on C .
Conjecture 9.2 (No Invariant Line Fields).
A rational map f carries
no invariant line field on its Julia set, except when f is double covered by an
integral torus endomorphism.
Theorem 9.3.
The no invariant line fields conjecture implies the density
of hyperbolic dynamics in the space of all rational maps.
Proof.
Let X=Ratd be the space of all rational maps of a fixed degree
d>1, and let X qc be the open dense set of quasiconformally stable
maps in this universal family. Let f # X qc. Then Teich(C , f )Mod(C , f )
parameterizes the component of X qcAut(C ) containing f. Since the
modular group is discrete and Aut(C ) acts with finite stabilizers, we have
dim Teich(C , f )=dim Ratd&dim Aut(C )=2d&2.
Clearly f has no indifferent cycles, since by J-stability these would have
to persist on an open neighborhood of f in Ratd and then on all of Ratd.
Therefore f has no Siegel disks or parabolic basins. Similarly f has no peri-
odic critical points, and therefore no superattracting basins. By a Theorem
of Man~ e , f has no Herman rings [29]. Thus all stable regions are attracting
basins. Finally f is not covered by an integral torus endomorphism because
such rational maps form a proper subvariety of Ratd.
By Theorem 6.8, the dimension of Teich(C , f ) is given by nAC+nLF, the
number of grand orbits of acyclic critical points in the Fatou set plus the
number of independent line fields on the Julia set. The no invariant line
fields conjecture then implies nLF=0, so nAC=2d&2. Thus all critical
points of f lie in the Fatou set and converge to attracting periodic cycles,
and therefore f is hyperbolic.
K
By a similar argument one may establish:
Theorem 9.4.
The no invariant line fields conjecture implies the density
of hyperbolic maps in the space of polynomials of any degree.
Remarks.
If f is covered by an integral torus endomorphism, then
Mod(C , f ) contains PSL2(Z) with finite index (compare [22]). It seems
390
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

likely that the modular group is finite for any other rational map whose
Julia set is the sphere. This finiteness would follow from the no invariant
line fields conjecture as well, since then Mod(C , f )=Aut( f ).
10. EXAMPLE: QUADRATIC POLYNOMIALS
To illustrate the general theory, we will describe the topological con-
jugacy classes of hyperbolic maps in the family of quadratic polynomials.
Every quadratic polynomial is conformally conjugate to one of the form
fc(z)=z2+c,
for a unique c # C. Let H/C be the open set of hyperbolic parameters.
From the definition c # H if and only if the critical point z=0 tends to an
attracting or superattracting cycle under iteration. Thus H is the disjoint
union of the following sets:
H( p):
the parameters such that z=0 tends to an attracting cycle of
period p1;
H0( p):
those where the critical point itself has order p; and
H():
those where the critical point tends to .
Theorem 10.1.
The hyperbolic quadratic polynomials are classified up to
conjugacy as follows.
1.
Each component of H( p) is isomorphic to a punctured disk and
represents a single quasiconformal conjugacy class. The multiplier of the
attracting cycle gives a natural isomorphism to 2*.
2.
The set H0( p) is a finite set of points, corresponding to the
punctures of H( p).
3.
The set H() is isomorphic to a punctured disk and consists of a
single quasiconformal conjugacy class.
Hyperbolic maps belonging to different components of H( p), H0( p) and
H() represent different topological conjugacy classes.
Proof.
Any component U of H(p) or of H() is open, and the forward
orbit of z=0 under fc is infinite for c in U. Thus the critical orbit relations
are constant on U, so by Theorem 2.7 U represents a single quasiconformal
conjugacy class.
Pick a basepoint c # U; then
U$Teich(C , fc)Mod(C , fc)
391
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

because any deformation of fc is conformally conjugate to a quadratic poly-
nomial, and two polynomials are identified by the modular group if and
only if they are conformally conjugate.
If c # H( p), then z=0 is contained in an attracting basin 00 and
f p
c : 00  00 is conformally conjugate to the Blaschke product B* : 2  2,
where
B*(z)=z(z+*)
1+* z
,
and * is the multiplier of the attracting cycle of fc. The Julia set of a hyper-
bolic map has measure zero, and therefore carries no invariant line field.
The superattracting basin of  is conjugate to (2, z2) and thus has no
moduli. Therefore the Teichmu ller space of fc is isomorphic H, the
Teichmu ller space of the punctured torus
Y=0disf =(CZZ{)&[0],
{=log *
2?i .
On this torus there is a dynamically distinguished isotopy class of oriented
simple closed curve #, which lifts to a closed loop around the attracting
periodic point. The modular group of fc is generated by a Dehn twist about
this loop, which acts by { [ {+1. Indeed, the modular group can be no
larger because # must be fixed. On the other hand, a Dehn twist about #
gives an element of Mod(2, B*) fixing the ideal boundary of the disk, and
so it can be extended from an automorphism of f p
c
on 00 to an
automorphism of (C , fc), fixing every point outside the grand orbit of 00.
(This Dehn twist can realized as monodromy in the family B* as * loops
once around the parameter *=0.) Since *=exp(2?i{) # 2* is a complete
invariant of a torus Y with a distinguished curve #, U is a punctured disk
parameterized by the multiplier.
As *  0 at the puncture, c remains bounded, so there is a limiting poly-
nomial which belongs to H0(p). Conversely a punctured neighborhood of
c # H0( p) belongs to H( p), because the multiplier is continuous. The set
H0( p) is contained in the roots of f p
c(0)=0 and is therefore finite.
We now turn to the open set H(). It is easy to see that H() contains
a neighborhood of  and it has no bounded component (by the maximum
principle), so it is connected. For c # H(), the canonical foliation of the
basin of infinity has a countable set of distinguished leaves meeting the
grand orbit of z=0. Thus 0fol has a wandering annulus, and therefore
Teich(C , fc)$H. The modular group of fc is at most Z, since the critical
point z=0 is distinguished and so any quasiconformal automorphism must
392
MCMULLEN AND SULLIVAN

fix the boundary of the wandering annulus pointwise. Since ?1(H())
{[1], the modular group is nontrivial and H() is isomorphic to a
punctured disk.
Any two topologically conjugate hyperbolic maps are quasiconformally
conjugate, and hence belong to the same component of H(p), H0(p) or
H(), by Theorem 2.9.
K
Corollary 10.2 (DouadyHubbard).
The Mandelbrot set
M=[c: f n
c(0) does not tend to infinity as n  ]
is connected.
Proof.
If M were disconnected, then H()=C&M would have
fundamental group larger than Z, contradicting the previous theorem.
K
Theorem 10.3.
Let h( p) denote the number of connected component of
H( p). Then:
:
p | n
h(p)=2n&1.
Proof.
Let Q(c)= f n
c(0). By induction on n, Q(c) is a monic polynomial
with integral coefficients such that Q$(c)=1 mod 2. Thus the resultant of
Q(c) and Q$(c) is odd, and therefore Q(c) has distinct roots. But these
roots correspond exactly to the parameters c such that fc is of type (ii) and
p | n. Thus
:
p | n
h( p)=deg Q=2n&1
(using Theorem 10.1).
K
This proof that Q(c) has simple roots was pointed out by Allan Adler
and by Andrew Gleason.
Remarks.
It is not hard to show that C&M consists exactly of the
J-stable parameters in the family fc, and that
C=H ? M? Q,
where Q is the open set of c such that the Julia set of fc has positive
measure and carries an invariant line field [33, Section 4]. Thus hyperbolic
dynamics is dense in the quadratic family if and only if Q is empty.
Douady and Hubbard formulated these theorems somewhat differently
(without quasiconformal conjugacy) but proved them using our quasi-
conformal deformation technique introduced in [44] together with their
393
HOMEOMORPHISMS AND DYNAMICS, III

explicit description of quadratic maps which amplifies greatly on the count
of Theorem 10.3 [13, 14].
The papers of this series probably would not have been written without
the inspiration and insight of these ``bonshommes.''
