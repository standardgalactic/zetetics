Preface
The notion of quantum ﬁeld was introduced in physics in the late of 1920’s
to unify the particle and the wave picture of quantum particles such as elec-
trons and photons which have the so-called wave-particle duality. After the
pioneering work on quantization of wave functions (the so-called “second
quantization”) by Dirac (1927), Jordan & Klein (1927), Jordan (1927) and
Jordan & Wigner (1928), Heisenberg and Pauli (1929, 1930)1 presented a
general theory of quantum ﬁelds which uniﬁes the foregoing theories, where
a quantum ﬁeld is “deﬁned” by the “canonical quantization” of a classical
wave ﬁeld.
A basic class of quantum ﬁelds is called free quantum ﬁelds which de-
scribe free (non-interacting) elementary particles. As far as the free quan-
tum ﬁelds are concerned, the quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) by Heisenberg
and Pauli was successful, giving a uniﬁcation of the wave and the parti-
cle picture of elementary particles with a general theoretical framework for
quantum systems in which the number of elementary particles may change.
But, if one applies the formalism of QFT to an interacting system of quan-
tum ﬁelds and calculates physical quantities of interest in an approximate
way (formal perturbation theory), then one encounters with divergent in-
tegrals and hence meaningless results. This is the so-called “diﬃculty of
divergence” in QFT.2
Later in 1940’s, a prescription to avoid the diﬃculty of divergence and
to obtain meaningful results which can be compared with experiments was
1Heisenberg, W. and Pauli, W., Zur Quantendynamik der Wellenfelder I, Z. Phys. 56,
pp.1–61; ibid. II, Z. Phys. 59, pp.168–190.
2There are two kinds of divergences: an ultraviolet and an infrared divergence. The
former (resp. latter) is a divergence with respect to large momenta (resp. small momenta
in the case of massless quantum particles).

invented by Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga. The prescription is called
“renormalization theory”, with which QFT as a physical theory revived. In
particular, quantum electrodynamics (QED), a QFT describing the inter-
action of electrons (the quantum electron ﬁeld) and photons (the quantum
radiation ﬁeld), explains experimental results with surprisingly high preci-
sions.3 From the mathematically rigorous point of view, however, the dif-
ﬁculty of divergence in QFT still remained unsolved; it was unclear what
kind of mathematics can justify QFT with renormalization theory.4
In these situations, mathematically rigorous investigations of QFT were
started in 1950’s to give a sound mathematical basis to it. Since then math-
ematical studies on quantum ﬁelds have formed a major stream of research
in modern mathematical physics. Many interesting mathematical theories
have been born from studies on mathematical problems in QFT and are
still developing to various directions, having close relations mutually. These
developments show richness of mathematics that the concept of quantum
ﬁeld has in itself and suggest that QFT may have something to do with
almost all areas in mathematics explicitly or implicitly. Quantum ﬁelds
are so fascinating, but not so easy to understand in their totality. The
purpose of this book is to describe and explain for beginners basic parts of
mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds.
In mathematical studies on QFT, there are two approaches basically:
axiomatic one and constructive one. The former assumes a set of axioms
that a quantum ﬁeld should obey and investigates what results can be
derived from the axioms. This approach is useful in analysis of general
aspects of QFT which are independent of individual quantum ﬁeld models.
QFT based on this approach is called axiomatic QFT. On the other hand,
the latter approach is concerned with showing the mathematical existence
of concrete models in QFT and deriving their properties in a mathemat-
ically rigorous way. This kind of QFT is called constructive QFT.5 But
this classiﬁcation of QFT is just for convenience; these two approaches
are complementary in fact. Rather, by employing these two approaches,
3See, e.g., Kinoshita, T. (ed.), Quantum Electrodynamics, 1990, World Scientiﬁc, Singa-
pore. The three physicists mentioned above were awarded the Nobel prize for physics in
1965 for their contributions to construction of QED with renormalization theory (Nobel
Lectures, Physics Vol.4, 1972, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam New York).
4At present (as of January 16, 2017), this problem is not solved yet for QFT in 4-
dimensional space-time.
5Originally the name “constructive QFT” was used for mathematical approaches con-
structing concretely relativistic interacting quantum ﬁeld models. But, here, we use the
word in a wider sense.

one may arrive at deeper, higher and wider cognition on the nature of the
microscopic world described by quantum ﬁelds.
This book consists of two parts. Part I, which is from Chapter 1 to
Chapter 7, is devoted to giving a detailed description of theory of Fock
spaces which are basic spaces in mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds.
From a purely mathematical point of view, Fock space is a general and
natural type of Hilbert space in the sense that it is deﬁned as the inﬁ-
nite direct sum of tensor products of a Hilbert space (see Chapters 4–6
for details), i.e., in Fock space, the concept of sum is incorporated with
the concept of product in a general and natural form in terms of Hilbert
space with the concept of inﬁnity (recall that “sum” and “product” are
fundamental concepts which appear in almost all places in the mathemat-
ical world, taking various forms). Historically, as its name suggests, ﬁrst
concrete forms of Fock space were presented by Fock6 in 1932 in relation
to the aforementioned “second quantization”. In the context of QFT, a
Fock space is used to describe state vectors of a quantum system in which
inﬁnitely many elementary particles may exist. It is well known that there
are two kinds of families of elementary particles, i.e., bosons and fermions.
Corresponding to this fact, there are three types of Fock spaces. A Fock
space describing state vectors of a quantum system consisting of the same
kind of bosons (resp. fermions) is called a boson (resp. fermion) Fock space
and a Fock space describing state vectors of a quantum system consisting
of the same kind of bosons and the same kind of fermions is called a boson-
fermion Fock space.7 In fact, a boson Fock space (resp. a fermion Fock
space) is identiﬁed with a closed subspace of a larger Hilbert space, called
a full Fock space. From this point of view, in this book, description of the
theory of Fock spaces starts with a full Fock space in Chapter 4. Theory
of boson Fock space (resp. fermion Fock space, boson-fermion Fock space)
is discussed in Chapter 5 (resp.
Chapter 6, Chapter 7).
In particular,
in Chapter 7, a theory of inﬁnite-dimensional Dirac type operators on a
boson-fermion Fock space, which is a new theory developed by the present
author in connection with supersymmetric QFT, is described in detail. As
far as the author knows, this is the ﬁrst time that the theory is presented
as a part of a book.
In Part II, which is from Chapter 8 to Chapter 14, QFT is described
6Fock, V., Konﬁgurationsraum und zweite Quantelung, Z. Phys. 75, pp.622–647.
7There is another type of Fock space, called a q-Fock space, which interpolates a boson
Fock space and a fermion Fock space. But, in this book, we do not discuss it.
 

viii
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
as applications of mathematical theories in Part I. Except Chapter 8 in
which general theories of QFT including axiomatic QFT are described,
concrete quantum ﬁeld models and their basic properties are discussed.
In Chapters 9–12, we construct four kinds of free quantum ﬁelds: (i) de
Broglie ﬁeld—non-relativistic matter ﬁeld (Chapter 9); (ii) Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld—relativistic scalar ﬁeld (Chapter 10); (iii) radiation ﬁeld (Chapter
11); (iv) Dirac ﬁeld—relativistic spinor ﬁeld (Chapter 12). Free quantum
ﬁelds do not describe interacting elementary particles. In Chapter 13, we
treat a simple interacting quantum ﬁeld model, called the van Hove model
or the van Hove-Miyatake (vHM) model. This model is a prototype for
interacting quantum ﬁeld models and has been extensively studied. In this
book, an abstract version of the model is deﬁned and analyzed in detail.
This approach makes clear general structures behind the concrete vHM
model. It is shown how the problem of ultraviolet divergence and infrared
divergence is solved in the abstract vHM model. In the last chapter, we
present a list of interacting quantum ﬁeld models, which are more complex
and/or realistic than the vHM model, and give a short description to each
model.
To make the book as self-contained as possible, appendices are
added.
This book is based on the author’s books “Fock Spaces and Quantum
Fields I, II” (2000, Nippon-Hyoron-Sha, Tokyo) written in Japanese, but it
is not just an English translation of them: in this English edition, enlarge-
ments as well as alterations have been made (e.g., Chapter 1 is newly added
and Chapter 0 (heuristic arguments on QFT in physics) in the Japanese
edition is not included). This book is primarily intended to be an introduc-
tory textbook, not a monograph as so are the Japanese editions. Hence the
bibliography in the book is partial and far from a complete one. It includes
also textbooks and monographs written in Japanese, some of which are
cited in the Japanese editions. They may be helpful for readers who can
read Japanese. The author would like to thank the readers of the Japanese
editions for their comments, remarks and questions, which have been useful
in writing this revised and enlarged edition.

Reader’s Guide
Chapter 1 is a preliminary chapter which is devoted to description of el-
ements of the theory of linear operators (in particular, unbounded self-
adjoint operators) on Hilbert spaces. Those who are famliar with these
topics can skip Chapter 1 and start reading in Chapter 2. In the present
book, Chapter 7 is not necessarily needed to read Chapters 8–14. Therefore,
for the ﬁrst reading, one can skip Chapter 7.

Chapter 1
Theory of Linear Operators
Fundamentals of the theory of linear operators on Banach spaces and Hilbert
spaces are described, being limited to concepts and subjects which are necessary
for understanding of the following chapters. Most of theorems and propositions in
this chapter are stated without proof. We refer the reader to standard textbooks
of functional analysis for their proofs.
1.1
Linear Operators on Vector Spaces
Throughout this book, the symbol K denotes R (the set of real numbers)
or C (the set of complex numbers). An element of K is called a scalar.
1.1.1
Deﬁnitions
Let X and Y be vector spaces over K. A linear operator T from X to
Y is a mapping from a subspace D of X to Y (i.e. T : D →Y ) such
that, for all Ψ, Φ ∈D and α, β ∈K,
T (αΨ + βΦ) = αT (Ψ) + βT (Φ)
(linearity).
The subspace D is called the domain of T and denoted as D = D(T ).
We sometimes write T (Ψ) = T Ψ. If D(T ) = X , then T is said to be
everywhere deﬁned.
We sometimes say simply “operator” instead of
“linear operator”.
It follows from the deﬁnition of linear operator that, for all n ∈N (the
set of natural numbers), Ψj ∈D(T ) and αj ∈K (j = 1, . . . , n),

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We denote the set of linear operators from X to Y by L(X , Y ). In
the case where X = Y , we use the following symbol:
L(X ) := L(X , X ).
As a convention, an element T in L(X ) is said to be a linear operator on
X even if it is not everywhere deﬁned.
Remark 1.1. In the case where X and Y are complex vector spaces,
there is another class of mappings from subspaces of X to Y which makes a
contrast with L(X , Y ). Let D be a subspace of X . A mapping A : D →Y
is said to be anti-linear if
A(αΨ + βΦ) = α∗A(Ψ) + β∗A(Φ),
Ψ, Φ ∈D, α, β ∈C,
where α∗is the complex conjugate of α. In this case, A is called an anti-
linear operator from X to Y with domain D(A) := D.
For T ∈L(X , Y ), the set
Ran(T ) := {T Ψ | Ψ ∈D(T )}
is called the range of T . It is easy to see that Ran(T ) is a subspace of Y .
We sometimes write Ran(T ) = Ran T .
For a subset D ⊂D(T ), a subset of Y is deﬁned as follows:
T D := {T Ψ|Ψ ∈D}.
If T ∈L(X ) and D ⊂D(T ) is a subspace of X such that T D ⊂D, then
one says that T leaves D invariant. In this case, D is called an invariant
subspace of T .
Two linear operators S, T ∈L(X , Y ) are said to be equal if D(T ) =
D(S) and T Ψ = SΨ, Ψ ∈D(T ). In this case we write T = S.
If there exists a subspace D ⊂D(S) ∩D(T ) such that, for all Ψ ∈D,
SΨ = T Ψ, then we say that S is equal to T on D; in this case we write as
“S = T on D”.
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be injective or one to one
if Ψ1 ̸= Ψ2 (Ψ1, Ψ2 ∈D(T )), then T Ψ1 ̸= T Ψ2 (this is equivalent to that, if
T Ψ1 = T Ψ2 (Ψ1, Ψ2 ∈D(T )), then Ψ1 = Ψ2). In this case, one can deﬁne
a linear operator T −1 ∈L(Y , X ) as follows:
D(T −1) := Ran(T ),
T −1Φ := Ψ, Φ ∈D(T −1),
where Ψ ∈D(T ) is the unique vector satisfying T Ψ = Φ. The operator
T −1 is called the inverse (or inverse operator) of T .
If Ran(T ) = Y , then T is said to be surjective.
 

Theory of Linear Operators
5
If T is injective and surjective, then T is said to be bijective and is
called a bijection.
It is easy to see that T is injective if and only if the kernel
ker T := {Ψ ∈D(T ) | T Ψ = 0}
of T is equal to {0}.
1.1.2
Eigenvalues
Let T ∈L(X ). In this case, there is a structure which relates T to numbers.
A number λ ∈K is called an eigenvalue of T if there exists a non-zero
vector Ψ ∈D(T ) such that T Ψ = λΨ. Such a vector Ψ is called an eigen-
vector of T with eigenvalue λ. The subspace spanned by all eigenvectors
of T with eigenvalue λ is called the eigenspace of T with eigenvalue λ.
We denote the set of eigenvalues of T by σp(T ) and call it the point
spectrum of T .
It is obvious that Ψ is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue λ if and only
if Ψ ∈ker(T −λ) \ {0} (T −λ := T −λIX , where IX is the identity on
X ).1 Hence the eigenspace of T with eigenvalue λ is equal to ker(T −λ).
The dimension2 dim ker(T −λ) of the eigenspace ker(T −λ) is called
the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ.
1.1.3
Sum and product of linear operators
For T1, . . . , Tn ∈L(X , Y ) with n ≥2, the sum Pn
j=1 Tj = T1 + · · · + Tn in
L(X , Y ) is deﬁned as follows:
D


n
X
j=1
Tj

:= ∩n
j=1D(Tj),


n
X
j=1
Tj

(Ψ) :=
n
X
j=1
TjΨ,
Ψ ∈D


n
X
j=1
Tj

.
Let Xj (j = 1, . . . , n + 1, n ≥1) be a vector space over K. Then, for
Tj ∈L(Xj, Xj+1) (j = 1, . . . , n), the product Tn · · · T1 ∈L(X1, Xn+1) is
deﬁned as follows:
D(Tn · · · T1) := {Ψ ∈D(T1)|Tk · · · T1Ψ ∈D(Tk+1), k = 1, . . . , n −1},
(Tn · · · T1)Ψ := Tn(Tn−1(· · · (T1Ψ) · · · )),
Ψ ∈D(Tn · · · T1).
1For subsets A and B of a set X, A \ B := {x ∈A|x ̸∈B} = A ∩Bc, where Bc := {x ∈
X|x ̸∈B}, the complement of B.
2For a vector space V , we denote by dim V ∈{0, 1, 2, . . .} ∪{∞} the dimension of V .

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For a linear operator T on X (i.e. T ∈L(X )) and n ∈{0}∪N, the nth
power T n of T is deﬁned as follows: T 0 := IX and, for n ≥1, T n := T · · · T
(the n-fold product of T ).
1.1.4
A partial ordering in linear operators
A linear operator S ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be an extension of a linear
operator T ∈L(X , Y ) if D(T ) ⊂D(S) and T Ψ = SΨ, Ψ ∈D(T ). This
relation is written as T ⊂S or S ⊃T .
Note that S = T if and only if S ⊂T and T ⊂S.
Let T ∈L(X , Y ) and D ⊂D(T ) be a subspace . Then one can deﬁne
a linear operator T ↾D by
D(T ↾D) := D,
(T ↾D)Ψ := T Ψ,
Ψ ∈D.
The operator T ↾D is called the restriction of T to D. It is obvious that
T ↾D ⊂T .
The relation ⊂in L(X , Y ) is a partial ordering.
The partial ordering ⊂in L(X , Y ) is preserved for product operations
of linear operators:
Proposition 1.1. Let S, T ∈L(X , Y ) such that S ⊂T . Let W and Z be
vector spaces over K. Then, for all Q ∈L(W , X ) and R ∈L(Y , Z ),
SQ ⊂T Q,
RS ⊂RT.
Proof. An easy exercise (Problem 2).
1.1.5
Commutator
For S, T ∈L(X ), the commutator [S, T ] ∈L(X ) is deﬁned by
[S, T ] := ST −T S.
By the deﬁnition of the sum of linear operators, one has
D([S, T ]) = D(ST ) ∩D(T S).
It follows that
[S, T ] = −[T, S]
(anti-symmetry).
The operators S and T are said to commute if, for all Ψ ∈D([S, T ]),
[S, T ]Ψ = 0. In this case one says that S commutes with T .
If there exists a subspace D ⊂D([S, T ]) such that [S, T ] = 0 on D, then
we say that S and T commute on D.

Remark 1.2. For each A ∈L(X ), one can deﬁne a mapping δA : L(X ) →
L(X ) by
δA(X) := [A, X],
X ∈L(X ).
Then, by direct computations, one can show that, for all X, Y ∈L(X ),
δA(XY ) = δA(X)Y + XδA(Y )
(Leibniz rule)
(1.1)
on D([A, X]Y ) ∩D(X[A, Y ]). This means that δA is in a sense a “diﬀeren-
tial” mapping.
For calculations of the commutator of operators, the formulae stated in
the following lemma are basic.
Lemma 1.1. Let A, B, Si, Tj ∈L(X ) (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m, n, m ∈
N).

(1.2)
on ∩n

Proof. (i) It is easy to see that, for all A ∈L(X ), [A, Pm

(ii) Formula 1.2 is proved by (1.1) and by induction in n.
1.2
Linear Operators on Banach Spaces
Let us consider the case where X and Y are Banach spaces over K with
norm ∥· ∥X and ∥· ∥Y respectively. In the case where K = C (resp. R),
X is called a complex (resp. real) Banach space.
For a subset D ⊂X , the set
D := {Ψ ∈X | ∃Ψn ∈D (n ∈N) such that lim
n→∞Ψn = Ψ}
is called the closure of D. If D = X , then D is said to be dense in X .

Bounded linear operators
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be bounded if there exists a
constant C ≥0 such that ∥T Ψ∥Y ≤C∥Ψ∥X , Ψ ∈D(T ). In this case, the
quantity
∥T ∥:=
sup
Ψ∈D(T )\{0}
∥T Ψ∥
∥Ψ∥
is called the operator norm (or simply norm) of T .
We denote by B(X , Y ) the set of everywhere deﬁned bounded linear
operators from X to Y :
B(X , Y ) := {T ∈L(X , Y ) | T is bounded with D(T ) = X }.
We set
B(X ) := B(X , X ).
We say that T ∈L(X , Y ) is densely deﬁned if D(T ) is dense in X .
The following theorem is a basic one on a densely deﬁned bounded linear
operator:
Theorem 1.1 (extension theorem). Let T ∈L(X , Y ) be densely de-
ﬁned and bounded.
Then there exists a unique bounded linear operator
eT ∈B(X , Y ) such that T ⊂eT. Moreover, ∥eT∥= ∥T ∥.
An application of this theorem immediately yields the following
theorem:
Theorem 1.2. Let T, S ∈B(X , Y ). Suppose that there exists a dense
subspace D of X such that T = S on D. Then T = S.
1.2.2
Closed operators
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be closed if, for every sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(T ) (i.e. Ψn ∈D(T ), n ∈N)3 such that limn→∞Ψn = Ψ ∈X
and limn→∞T Ψn = Φ ∈Y , it holds that Ψ ∈D(T ) and Φ = T Ψ.
Proposition 1.2. Any element in B(X , Y ) is closed.
In what follows, a closed linear operator is called a closed operator
simply. An importance of the concept of closed operator is shown in the
following theorem.
3We sometimes write {Ψn}∞
n=1 ⊂D to mean that {Ψn}∞
n=1 is a sequence in a set D
(i.e. Ψn ∈D, ∀n ∈N).

Theorem 1.3 (closed graph theorem). Let
T
∈
L(X , Y )
with
D(T ) = X . Then T is bounded if and only if T is closed.
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be closable if it has a closed
extension (i.e. there exists a closed operator S ∈L(X , Y ) such that T ⊂
S). Every closed operator is closable.
For a closable operator T ∈L(X , Y ), a closed operator T, called the
closure of T , is deﬁned as follows:
D(T) := {Ψ ∈X | ∃Ψn ∈D(T ) (n ∈N) such that lim
n→∞Ψn = Ψ
and ∃lim
n→∞T Ψn},
TΨ := lim
n→∞T Ψn.
It follows that T ⊂T and T is the smallest closed extension of T (i.e. for
all closed extensions S of T , T ⊂S). Hence, if T is closed, then T = T .
It is easy to see that, for two closable operators S, T ∈L(X , Y ), the
following holds:
T ⊂S =⇒T ⊂S.
(1.3)
For an operator T ∈L(X , Y ), a subspace D ⊂D(T ) is called a core
of T if, for each Ψ ∈D(T ), there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D such that
limn→∞Ψn = Ψ and limn→∞T Ψn = T Ψ.
It follows that, in the case where T is closed, a subspace D ⊂D(T ) is
a core of T if and only if T ↾D = T .
The following theorem gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the
sum A + B of two closed operators A, B ∈L(X , Y ) to be closed:
Theorem 1.4. Let A and B be closed operators from X to Y .
Then
A + B is closed if and only if there exists a constant C > 0 such that
∥AΨ∥+ ∥BΨ∥≤C(∥(A + B)Ψ∥+ ∥Ψ∥), Ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B).
1.2.3
Resolvent set and spectra of a linear operator
Let X be a complex Banach space (i.e.
a Banach space over C).
Let
T ∈L(X ). The subset of C
ρ(T ) := {λ ∈C | T −λ is injective, Ran(T −λ) = X ,
(T −λ)−1 is bounded}
is called the resolvent set of T . For each λ ∈ρ(T ), the bounded operator
(T −λ)−1 is called the resolvent of T at λ.

The complement of ρ(T )
σ(T ) := C \ ρ(T )
is called the spectrum of T . One can also consider the following subsets
of σ(T ):
σr(T ) := {λ ∈C | T −λ is injective and, Ran(T −λ) ̸= X },
σc(T ) := {λ ∈C | T −λ is injective, Ran(T −λ) = X
and (T −λ)−1 is unbounded},
which are called respectively the residual spectrum and continuous
spectrum of T .

Mapping properties of T −λ and spectra of T
The four sets ρ(T ), σr(T ), σc(T ) and σp(T ) are mutually disjoint and
C = ρ(T ) ∪σr(T ) ∪σc(T ) ∪σp(T ),
σ(T ) = σr(T ) ∪σc(T ) ∪σp(T ).
(1.4)
An eigenvalue λ of T is called a discrete eigenvalue of T if the mul-
tiplicity of λ is ﬁnite and λ is an isolated point of σ(T ). The set of all
discrete eigenvalues of T is called the discrete spectrum of T and de-
noted by σd(T ). Obviously σd(T ) ⊂σp(T ).
Theorem 1.5. For all T ∈B(X ), σ(T ) is a non-empty bounded closed
subset in C with σ(T ) ⊂{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥T ∥}.
Proposition 1.3. Let T be closable. Then:
(i) ρ(T ) = ρ(T ) and σ(T ) = σ(T).
(ii) For all λ ∈ρ(T ), (T −λ)−1 = (T −λ)−1.
(iii) ρ(T ) is an open set in C and σ(T ) is a closed set in C.
In the case of closed operators, one has a simple criterion to identify
ρ(T ):
Proposition 1.4. Let T be closed. Then λ ∈ρ(T ) if and only if T −λ is
bijective.

Compact operators
There is an important class of bounded linear operators.
An operator
T ∈L(X , Y ) with D(T ) = X is said to be compact if, for every bounded
sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in X , there exists a subsequence {Ψnk}∞
k=1 such that
{T Ψnk}∞
k=1 converges.
It follows that a compact operator is bounded.
Moreover, T ∈L(X , Y ) with D(T ) = X is compact if and only if T
maps every bounded set in X to a pre-compact set in Y .
Fundamental properties of a compact operator can be found in most
textbooks on functional analysis. Here we only recall spectral properties of
a compact operator:
Lemma 1.2. Let T be a compact operator on a Banach space X . Then
σ(T ) \ {0} consists of only discrete eigenvalues of T and, if σ(T ) \ {0} is
an inﬁnite set {λn}∞
n=1, then limn→∞λn = 0.
1.3
Linear Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Let H be an inner product space (pre-Hilbert space) over K. We denote
its inner product and norm by ⟨, ⟩H (linear in the second variable in the
case K = C) and ∥· ∥H respectively. But we sometimes omit the subscript
H if there is no danger of confusion in the context under consideration.
Recall that a Hilbert space H over K is a complete inner product space
over K and hence a Banach space over K with norm ∥·∥H . A Hilbert space
over C (resp. R) is called a complex (resp. real) Hilbert space.
1.3.1
The dual space of a Hilbert space
Let H be a Hilbert space over K. Then an element in
H ∗:= B(H , K)
is called a bounded (or continuous) linear functional on H . The set
H ∗is called the dual space of H .
Theorem 1.6 (Riesz’s representation theorem). For each F ∈H ∗,
there exists a unique vector ΦF ∈H such that F(Ψ) = ⟨ΦF , Ψ⟩, Ψ ∈H .
Moreover, ∥F∥= ∥ΦF∥.
1.3.2
Adjoint operators
Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces over K. For a densely deﬁned linear op-
erator T ∈L(H1, H2), a linear operator T ∗∈L(H2, H1), call the adjoint

of T , is deﬁned as follows:
D(T ∗) := {Φ ∈H2|∃ΘΦ ∈H1 such that ∀Ψ ∈D(T ), ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩= ⟨ΘΦ, Ψ⟩},
T ∗Φ := ΘΦ, Φ ∈D(T ∗).
If T ∗is densely deﬁned, we denote its adjoint by T ∗∗, i.e., T ∗∗:= (T ∗)∗.
Let T, S ∈L(H1, H2) be densely deﬁned. Then the following is easily
proved:
T ⊂S =⇒S∗⊂T ∗.
Proposition 1.5. Let T ∈L(H1, H2) be densely deﬁned. Then:
(i) T ∗is closed.
(ii) T is closable if and only if T ∗is densely deﬁned. In that case, T
∗= T ∗
and T = T ∗∗.
Proposition 1.6. For all T ∈B(H1, H2), T ∗∈B(H2, H1) and
∥T ∥= ∥T ∗∥.
Moreover, T = T ∗∗.
Proposition 1.7. If T ∈L(H1, H2) is a densely deﬁned closable un-
bounded operator, then T ∗is unbounded.
Proof. By Proposition 1.5, T ∗is densely deﬁned and closed. Hence, if T ∗
is bounded, then T ∗∈B(H2, H1). Then, by Proposition 1.6, T = (T ∗)∗∈
B(H1, H2). But this is a contradiction. Thus T ∗is unbounded.
1.3.3
Topologies of convergence of bounded linear operators
There are three kinds of concepts on convergence for sequences in
B(H1, H2).
Let {Tn}∞
n=1 be a sequence in B(H1, H2) and T ∈B(H1, H2).
(i) {Tn}∞
n=1 is said to converge uniformly to T as n →∞if limn→∞
∥Tn −T ∥= 0. In this case, we write u- limn→∞Tn = T and T is called the
uniform limit of {Tn}∞
n=1.
(ii) {Tn}∞
n=1 is said to converge strongly to T as n →∞if, for all
Ψ ∈H1, limn→∞∥TnΨ−T Ψ∥= 0. In this case, we write s- limn→∞Tn = T
and T is called the strong limit of {Tn}∞
n=1.
(iii) {Tn}∞
n=1 is said to converge weakly to T as n →∞if, for all
Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2, limn→∞⟨Φ, TnΨ⟩= ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩. In this case, we write
w- limn→∞Tn = T and T is called the weak limit of {Tn}∞
n=1.

Hierarchy of convergences
The logical relations shown in Fig. 1.2 hold.
The following fact is useful.
Proposition 1.8. Suppose that w- limn→∞Tn = T . Then supn∈N ∥Tn∥<
∞.
1.3.4
Graph and core
For a linear operator T ∈L(H1, H2), the subspace
G (T ) := {(Ψ, T Ψ) ∈H1 ⊕H2|Ψ ∈D(T )}
of the direct sum Hilbert space H1 ⊕H2 := {(Ψ, Φ)|Ψ ∈H1, Φ ∈H2}4 is
called the graph of T .
It is easy to see that, for two linear operators S and T in L(H1, H2),
T = S if and only if G (S) = G (T ).
The graph G (T ) is closed (hence a Hilbert space) if and only if T is
closed.
For a subset D of a Hilbert space H , we denote by D⊥the orthogonal
complement of D in H :
D⊥:= {Ψ ∈H | ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩H = 0, Φ ∈D}.
Proposition 1.9. Let T be closed and D ⊂D(T ) be a subspace. Then D
is a core of T if and only if G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}.
Proof. Let D be a core of T and let (Ψ, T Ψ) ∈G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ). Then,
for all Φ ∈D, ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩+ ⟨T Φ, T Ψ⟩= 0. Since D is a core of T , there exists a
sequence {Φn}∞
n=1 in D such that Φn →Ψ, T Φn →T Ψ (n →∞). Letting
Φ = Φn in the above equation and taking the limit n →∞, we obtain
∥Ψ∥2 + ∥T Ψ∥2 = 0. Hence Ψ = 0, T Ψ = 0. Thus G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}.
Conversely, let G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}. Then G (T ↾D) is dense
in G (T ).
Hence, for each (Ψ, T Ψ) ∈G (T ), there exists a sequence
{(Ψn, T Ψn)}∞
n=1 in G (T ↾D) such that (Ψn, T Ψn) →(Ψ, T Ψ) (n →∞) in
G (T ). Hence Ψn ∈D, n ≥1 and Ψn →Ψ, T Ψn →T Ψ (n →∞). Thus D
is a core of T .
4The inner product of H1 ⊕H2 is deﬁned by ⟨(Ψ, Φ), (Ψ′, Φ′)⟩:= ⟨Ψ, Ψ′⟩H1 +
⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2 , Ψ, Ψ′ ∈H1, Φ, Φ′ ∈H2.
 

14
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The following proposition is often used to identify a smaller core of a
closed operator.
Proposition 1.10. Let T ∈L(H1, H2) be closed and D ⊂D(T ) be a
core of T . Let F ⊂D be a subspace of H1 such that, for each Ψ ∈D,
there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in F satisfying Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ
(n →∞). Then F is a core of T .
Proof. Let (Φ, T Φ) ∈G (T ↾F)⊥∩G (T ). The, for all Ψ ∈F,
⟨Φ, Ψ⟩+ ⟨T Φ, T Ψ⟩= 0.
By the property of F assumed and a limiting argument, this equation
extends to all Ψ ∈D, implying that (Φ, T Φ) ∈G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ). Hence,
by Proposition 1.9, (Φ, T Φ) = 0. Thus G (T ↾F)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}. By
Proposition 1.9 again, F is a core of T .
1.3.5
Unitary equivalence
An operator U ∈B(H1, H2) is said to be unitary if Ran(U) = H2 and
⟨UΨ, UΦ⟩H2 = ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩H1 , Ψ, Φ ∈H1.
It is shown that an operator U ∈B(H1, H2) is unitary if and only if
U ∗U = IH1 and UU ∗= IH2.
A unitary operator is called also a unitary transformation.
Let A ∈L(H1) and B ∈L(H2). Then A and B are said to be unitarily
equivalent (or A is said to be unitarily equivalent to B) if there exists a
unitary operator U : H1 →H2 satisfying UAU −1 = B.
Theorem 1.7 (unitary invariance of spectra). Let H1 and H2 be
complex Hilbert spaces (i.e., Hilbert spaces over C).
Suppose that A ∈
L(H1) and B ∈L(H2) are unitarily equivalent. Then the following (i)–(iv)
hold:
(i) σ(A) = σ(B)
(ii) σp(A) = σp(B) and, for all λ ∈σp(A), dim ker(A −λ) = dim ker(B −
λ).
(iii) σr(A) = σr(B).
(iv) σc(A) = σc(B).
The following proposition is useful for proving a unitary equivalence
between two closed operators.
 

Theory of Linear Operators
15
Proposition 1.11. Let A and B be closed operators on Hilbert spaces H1
and H2 respectively. Suppose that there exist a unitary operator U : H1 →
H2 and a core F ⊂H2 of B such that U −1F is a core of A and
UAU −1 = B
on F.
(1.5)
Then the operator equality
UAU −1 = B
(1.6)
holds.
Proof. The operator UAU −1 is closed.
Hence (1.5) implies that B ⊂
UAU −1. Relation (1.5) also gives A = U −1BU on U −1F. Since U −1(F)
is a core of A, it follows that A ⊂U −1BU. Hence, by Proposition 1.1,
UAU −1 ⊂B. Thus (1.6) holds.
1.3.6
A decomposition theorem
The following theorem is very useful:
Theorem 1.8. Let T be a closed operator from a Hilbert space H to a
Hilbert space K . Then:
(i) The kernel ker T is closed.
(ii) If D(T ) is dense in addition, then
H = ker T ⊕Ran(T ∗).
(1.7)
We call (1.7) the natural orthogonal decomposition of H with
respect to T .
1.3.7
Relative boundedness
Let S and T be linear operators from a Hilbert space H to a Hilbert space
K such that D(T ) ⊂D(S) and there exist constants a, b ≥0 such that
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
Then S is said to be T -bounded or relatively bounded with respect
to T . In this case, the constant a is called a relative upper bound of S
with respect to T .
If a > 0 can be taken arbitrarily small (b may depend on a), then S is
said to be inﬁnitesimally small with respect to T .
 

16
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 1.9. Let T be closed and S be closable. Suppose that D(T ) ⊂
D(S) and, for some real number a ∈[0, 1) and b ≥0,
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.8)
Then T + S is closed and any core of T is a core of T + S.
Proof. By (1.8), for all Ψ ∈D(T ),
∥T Ψ∥≤∥(T + S)Ψ∥+ ∥SΨ∥≤∥(T + S)Ψ∥+ a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥.
Hence
∥T Ψ∥≤
1
1 −a(∥(T + S)Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥).
(1.9)
Now let Ψn ∈D(T + S) = D(T ), Ψn →Ψ ∈H and (T + S)Ψn →Φ ∈H
as n →∞. Then, by (1.9), {T Ψn}n is a Cauchy sequence. Hence, by the
closedness of T , Ψ ∈D(T ) = D(T + S) and T Ψ = limn→∞T Ψn. Hence
limn→∞SΨn = Φ −T Ψ, which means that SΨ = Φ −T Ψ. But, since
D(T ) ⊂D(S) ⊂D(S), it follows that SΨ = Φ −T Ψ, i.e., (T + S)Ψ = Φ.
Thus T + S is closed.
Let D be any core of T .
Then, for each Ψ ∈D(T ), there exists a
sequence {Ψn}n in D such that Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ as n →∞.
Then, by (1.8), SΨn →SΨ (n →∞). Hence (T + S)Ψn →(T + S)Ψ.
Thus D is a core of T + S.
The following proposition is about an extension of an inequality on
relative boundedness.
Proposition 1.12. Let T be closed and S be closable. Suppose that there
exists a subspace D ⊂D(T ) ∩D(S) such that D is a core of T and
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D.
(1.10)
Then, D(T ) ⊂D(S) and
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.11)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(T ). Then there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 with Ψn ∈D
such that Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ as n →∞. By (1.10), we have
∥SΨn∥≤a∥T Ψn∥+ b∥Ψn∥,
n ∈N
(1.12)
and
∥SΨn −SΨm∥≤a∥T Ψn −T Ψm∥+ b∥Ψn −Ψm∥,
n, m ∈N.
The latter implies that {SΨn}∞
n=1
is a Cauchy sequence.
Hence
limn→∞SΨn exists. Therefore Ψ ∈D(S) and limn→∞SΨn = SΨ. Hence
D(T ) ⊂D(S). Taking the limit n →∞in (1.12), we obtain (1.11).

Self-adjoint operators
Let H be a Hilbert space over K.
A linear operator T on H is said to be Hermitian if, for all Ψ, Φ ∈
D(T ), ⟨Ψ, T Φ⟩= ⟨T Ψ, Φ⟩(Hermitian property).
A densely deﬁned Hermitian operator T on H is called a symmetric
operator. Hence T is symmetric if and only if D(T ) is dense and T ⊂T ∗.
A densely deﬁned linear operator T on H is said to be self-adjoint if
T = T ∗.
By Proposition 1.5(i), a self-adjoint operator is closed.

Fig. 1.3
A hierarchy of operators
Remark 1.3. There are mathematical literatures in which the word “Her-
mitian operator” is used to mean “symmetric operator” and vice versa. In
many literatures in physical quantum theory, no care is paid to the dis-
tinction of the three kinds of operators deﬁned above as well as operator
domains. It is obvious that a self-adjoint operator is a symmetric operator.
But it has to be emphasized that the converse is not true, i.e., a closed sym-
metric operator is not necessarily self-adjoint. Also the following theorem
should be kept in mind:
Theorem 1.10 (the Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem). An everywhere de-
ﬁned symmetric operator on a Hilbert space is bounded (hence it is a bounded
self-adjoint operator).
Proof. This follows from an application of the closed graph theorem (The-
orem 1.3). Let T be an everywhere deﬁned symmetric operator on a Hilbert
space H . Let {Ψn}∞
n=1 be a sequence in H such that Ψn →Ψ ∈H and
T Ψn →η ∈H as n →∞.
By the Hermitian property of T , for all
Φ ∈H , ⟨Φ, T Ψn⟩= ⟨T Φ, Ψn⟩. Hence, taking the limit n →∞, we obtain
⟨Φ, η⟩= ⟨T Φ, Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩. Hence η = T Ψ. Therefore T is closed. Thus,
by the closed graph theorem, T is bounded.
This theorem implies that an unbounded symmetric operator is not ev-
erywhere deﬁned.
It follows from Proposition 1.5(i) that a symmetric operator is closable.
 

18
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A symmetric operator T is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure
T is self-adjoint.
Let T be a Hermitian operator on H . Then, for all Ψ ∈D(T ), ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩
is a real number. If there exists a constant γ ∈R such that, for all Ψ ∈
D(T ), ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩≥γ∥Ψ∥2, then T is said to be bounded from below
or bounded below simply.
In this case we write T ≥γ or γ ≤T .
In
particular, if γ > 0 (resp. γ = 0), then T is said to be strictly positive
(resp. positive or non-negative).
If −T is bounded from below with −T ≥−b (b ∈R), then T is said
to be bounded from above. In this case we write T ≤b or b ≥T . In
particular, if b < 0 (resp. b = 0), then T is said to be strictly negative
(resp. negative or non-positive).
If T is bounded from below or bounded from above, then T is said to
be semi-bounded.
If T and S are Hermitian operators on H satisfying D(T ) ⊂D(S) and
⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩≤⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩, Ψ ∈D(T ), then we write S ≤T . This is equivalent to
(T −S) ↾D(T ) ≥0.
The relation ≤in the space of symmetric operators is a partial ordering.
Proposition 1.13. Let H be a complex Hilbert space (i.e. a Hilbert space
over C) and T be a Hermitian operator on H . Then, for all z ∈C \ R,
A −z is injective and (A −z)−1 is bounded with
∥(A −z)−1∥≤

The next theorem states basic spectral properties of a self-adjoint
operator.
Theorem 1.11. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and T be a self-adjoint
operator on H .
(i) The spectrum σ(T ) is a non-empty closed subset of R. In particular,
C \ R ⊂ρ(T ).
(ii) The residual spectrum σr(T ) is empty (Problem 6) and hence
σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪σc(T ).
(iii) Let λ ∈R.
Then λ ∈σ(T ) if and only if there exists a sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1 of unit vectors in D(T ) (∥Ψn∥= 1, n ≥1) such that
limn→∞∥(T −λ)Ψn∥= 0.

Trace class operators
Let H be a complex Hilbert space and T ∈B(H ). If H is ﬁnite dimen-
sional, i.e., dim H < ∞, then we deﬁne Tr T ∈C by
Tr T :=
dim H
X
n=1
⟨en, T en⟩,
where {en}dim H
n=1
is a complete orthonormal system (CONS) of H . It is
shown that Tr T is independent of the choice of CONS’s of H . The number
Tr T is called the trace of T .
We next consider the case where H is an inﬁnite dimensional separable
Hilbert space. There are two cases.
(a) The case T ≥0. In this case, for any CONS {en}∞
n=1 of H ,
Tr T :=
∞
X
n=1
⟨en, T en⟩
is ﬁnite or +∞, independently of the choice of {en}∞
n=1. The number Tr T
is called the trace of T .
(b) The case where T is not necessarily non-negative. In this case, T ∗T
is a non-negative bounded self-adjoint operator. Hence there exists a unique
non-negative self-adjoint operator |T | ∈B(H ) such that |T |2 = T ∗T . The
operator |T | is called the absolute value or modulus of T .
If Tr |T | < ∞, then T is said to be trace class.
In this case,
P∞
n=1 | ⟨en, T en⟩| < ∞for all CONS’s {en}∞
n=1 of H and P∞
n=1 ⟨en, T en⟩
is independent of the choice of {en}∞
n=1. Hence one can deﬁne

This complex number is called the trace of T .
We denote by T1(H ) the set of all trace class operators on H . The
following proposition is well known5:
Proposition 1.14. The set T1(H ) is a subspace of B(H ). Moreover, for
all T ∈T1(H ) and S ∈B(H ), T ∗, T S and ST are in T1(H ) and
Tr (T S) = Tr (ST ).
The following proposition is easily proved:
Proposition 1.15. Let A, B ∈B(H ) be self-adjoint such that A ≥B ≥0.
Then Tr A ≥Tr B.

A linear operator P on H is called the orthogonal projection if
P 2 = P (idempotent) and P ∗= P (self-adjoint). It follows that P ≥0.
Proposition 1.16. Let P be an orthogonal projection on a separable Hilbert
space H . Then
(i) Tr P = dim Ran(P).
In particular, P is trace class if and only if
dim Ran(P) < ∞.
(ii) Let Q be an orthogonal projection on H such that P ≥Q.
Then
dim Ran(P) ≥dim Ran(Q).
(iii) Let P1, . . . , PN be orthogonal projections on H
such that P

Direct Sum Operators
Let H1, . . . , HN with N ≥2 be complex Hilbert spaces and
⊕N
j=1Hj = {Ψ = (Ψ1, . . . , ΨN)|Ψj ∈Hj, j = 1, . . . , N}
be the direct sum Hilbert space of them.6 Let Aj be a linear operator on
Hj. Then the direct sum operator ⊕N
j=1Aj on ⊕N
j=1Hj is deﬁned as
follows:
D(⊕N
j=1Aj) := ⊕N
j=1D(Aj),
(⊕N
j=1Aj)Ψ := (A1Ψ1, . . . , ANΨN),
Ψ ∈D(⊕N
j=1Aj).
Theorem 1.12. Let A := ⊕N
j=1Aj. Then:
(i) For all z ∈C, ker(A −z) = ⊕N
j=1 ker(Aj −z).
(ii) σ(A) = ∪N
j=1σ(Aj).
(iii) σp(A) = ∪N
j=1σp(Aj).
Proof. (i) We have A−z = ⊕N
j=1(Aj −z) · · · (∗), which implies the desired
result.
(ii) The statement is equivalent to that ρ(A) = ∩N
j=1ρ(Aj). Hence we
prove the latter. Let z ∈ρ(A). Then A −z is injective and (A −z)−1
is bounded. Hence, by (i), each Aj −z is injective. The boundedness of
(A −z)−1 implies that, for a constant C > 0, ∥(A −z)Ψ∥≥C∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈
D(A). Note that
∥(A −z)Ψ∥2 =
N
X
j=1
∥(Aj −z)Ψj∥2,
Ψ ∈D(A) · · · (∗∗).
6The inner product is deﬁned by ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩:= PN
j=1 ⟨Ψj, Φj⟩(Ψ, Φ ∈⊕N
j=1Hj).
 

Theory of Linear Operators
21
Fixing j = 1, . . . , N and taking Ψ ∈D(A) as Ψk = δjkη (k = 1, . . . , N)
with η ∈D(Aj) being arbitrary, we obtain ∥(Aj −z)η∥≥C∥η∥. Hence
(Aj −z)−1 is bounded. Moreover, Ran(A −z) is dense in ⊕N
j=1Hj. By this
property and (∗), for each j = 1, . . . , N, Ran(Aj −z) is dense in Hj. Hence
z ∈ρ(Aj). Thus ρ(A) ⊂∩N
j=1ρ(Aj).
Conversely, let z ∈∩N
j=1ρ(Aj).
Then each Aj −z is injective with
(Aj −z)−1 being bounded and Ran(Aj −z) is dense in Hj. The former
implies that A−z is injective with (A−z)−1 being bounded (use (∗∗)), while
the latter implies that Ran(A −z) is dense in ⊕N
j=1Hj. Hence z ∈ρ(A).
Thus ∩N
j=1ρ(Aj) ⊂ρ(A).
(iii) This easily follows from (i).

Self-adjoint Operators and Related Subjects
In what follows, we mean by a Hilbert space a complex Hilbert space unless
otherwise stated.
In this section we present facts on self-adjoint operators and related
subjects which are used later in this book.
1.5.1
Criteria on (essential) self-adjointness for
symmetric operators
In this subsection, we summarize criteria for a symmetric operator to be
(essentially) self-adjoint. As usual, we denote by i the imaginary unit.
Proposition 1.17. Let T be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space H .
Then the following (i)–(iii) are equivalent:
(i) T is self-adjoint.
(ii) T is closed and ker(T ∗± i) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T ± i) = H .
A simple application of Proposition 1.17 is given as follows:
Theorem 1.13. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H .
Then, for all
n ∈N, T n is self-adjoint.
Proof. Let αk := eiπ/2ne2πik/n, k = 0, . . . , n −1, so that αn
k = i, k =
0, . . . , n −1. Then T n −i = Qn−1
k=0(T −αk). Each αk is not real. Hence
αk and α∗
k are in ρ(T ). Therefore A := (T −αn−1)−1 · · · (T −α0)−1 is in
B(H ) and A∗= (T −α∗
0)−1 · · · (T −α∗
n−1)−1 which is injective. Hence, by
 

22
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
the natural orthogonal decomposition of H with respect to A∗or a general
fact (Problem 4), Ran(A) is dense in H . But Ran(A) ⊂D(T n). Hence
D(T n) is dense. It follows that T n is symmetric. For all Φ ∈H , we have
(T n −i)AΦ = Φ. Hence Ran(T n −i) = H . Similarly one can show that
Ran(T n + i) = H . Thus, by Proposition 1.17, T n is self-adjoint.
In the case of a non-negative symmetric operator T , one has simpler
criteria for T to be self-adjoint:
Proposition 1.18. Let T be a non-negative symmetric operator on a
Hilbert space H . Then the following (i)–(iii) are equivalent:
(i) T is self-adjoint.
(ii) T is closed and ker(T ∗+ 1) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T + 1) = H .
We also need criteria for a symmetric operator to be essentially self-
adjoint.
Proposition 1.19. Let T be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space H .
Then the following (i)–(iii) are equivalent:
(i) T is essentially self-adjoint.
(ii) ker(T ∗± i) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T ± i) are dense in H .
Proposition 1.20. Let T be a non-negative symmetric operator on a
Hilbert space H . Then the following (i)–(iii) are equivalent:
(i) T is essentially self-adjoint.
(ii) ker(T ∗+ 1) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T + 1) is dense in H .
A symmetric operator T is said to be essentially self-adjoint on a dense
subspace D ⊂D(T ) if T ↾D (the restriction of T to D) is essentially
self-adjoint. In this case one has T = T ↾D.
Proposition 1.21. Let T be a self-adjoint operator and D be a dense sub-
space such that D ⊂D(T ). Then D is a core of T if and only if T is
essentially self-adjoint on D.
Proof. “if part” is obvious. Let D be a core of T . Then, by Proposition
1.17(iii), for each Φ ∈H , there exists a vector Ψ ∈D(T ) such that (T +
 

Theory of Linear Operators
23
i)Ψ = Φ. Since D is a core of T , there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D such
that Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ as n →∞. Hence (T +i)Ψn →(T +i)Ψ = Φ
as n →∞. This means that Ran((T + i) ↾D) is dense in H . Similarly
one can show that Ran((T −i) ↾D) is dense in H . Thus, by Proposition
1.19(iii), T is essentially self-adjoint on D.
The next proposition may be useful to prove the essential self-
adjointness of a symmetric operator on a suitable subspace.
Proposition 1.22. Let H and K be Hilbert spaces and D be a dense sub-
space of K . Let T and S be symmetric operators on H and K respectively,
satisfying the following (i) and (ii):
(i) S is essentially self-adjoint on D.
(ii) There exists a unitary transformation U : H →K such that U −1D ⊂
D(T ) and, for all Ψ ∈D, UT U −1Ψ = SΨ.
Then T is essentially self-adjoint on U −1D and operator equality UTU −1 =
S holds.
Proof. By (ii), we have (S ± i)D = (UT U −1 ± i)D = U(T ± i)U −1D. By
(i) and Proposition 1.19, (S ± i)D are dense in K . Hence U(T ± i)U −1D
are dense in K . Since a unitary operator maps a dense subspace to a dense
subspace, it follows that (T ±i)U −1D is dense in H . Thus, by Proposition
1.19 again, T is essentially self-adjoint on U −1D. We have UTU −1 ⊃S ↾D.
Hence UTU −1 ⊃S. Since the both sides are self-adjoint, operator equality
UTU −1 = S holds (recall that, if A is a self-adjoint operator and B is a
symmetric operator on a Hilbert space satisfying A ⊂B, then A = B).
1.5.2
The Kato-Rellich theorem
Let T be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H and S be a symmetric
operator on H . Then a natural question is: under what condition is T + S
self-adjoint? A basic theorem on this question is given as follows:
Theorem 1.14 (the Kato-Rellich theorem). Let T and S be as above.
Suppose that S is T -bounded with a relative upper bound less than 1, i.e.,
D(T ) ⊂D(S) and there exist constants a ∈[0, 1) and b ≥0 such that
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.14)
Then T + S is self-adjoint and essentially self-adjoint on any core of T .
Moreover, if T is bounded from below with T ≥γ (γ ∈R), then T + S is
bounded from below with
T + S ≥γ −max{b/(1 −a), a|γ| + b}.
(1.15)
 

24
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. See, e.g., [Arai (2006b), Theorem 2.7], [Kato (1976), p.287, Theo-
rem 4.3] or [Reed and Simon (1975), Theorem X.12].
Corollary 1.1. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H and S be a symmet-
ric operator on H such that D(T ) ⊂D(S).
(i) If S is inﬁnitesimally small with respect to T , then T +S is self-adjoint
and essentially self-adjoint on any core of T .
(ii) If S is bounded, then T + S is self-adjoint and essentially self-adjoint
on any core of T . Moreover, if T ≥γ (γ ∈R), then T + S ≥γ −∥S∥.
Proof. In part (i) (resp.
(ii)), one can take a < 1 (resp.
a = 0 < 1,
b = ∥S∥) in (1.14).
Hence, by Theorem 1.14, one obtains the desired
results.
1.5.3
Multiplication operators
Let (X, Σ, µ) be a measure space and L2(X, dµ) be the complex Hilbert
space of equivalence classes of complex-valued square integrable functions
on (X, Σ, µ):
L2(X, dµ) :=

f : X →C ∪{±∞}, Σ-measurable|
Z
X
|f(x)|2dµ(x) < ∞

.
The inner product of L2(X, dµ) is deﬁned by
⟨f, g⟩:=
Z
X
f(x)∗g(x)dµ(x),
f, g ∈L2(X, dµ),
where, for a complex number z ∈C, z∗denotes the complex conjugate of
z.
Example 1.1. In the case where X is a Borel subset M of Rn (n ∈N),
Σ = {B ∩M|B ∈Bn} (Bn is the Borel ﬁeld of Rn) and µ is the n-
dimensional Lebesgue measure, we write L2(X, dµ) = L2(M).
Let F : X →C ∪{±∞} be a Σ-measurable function such that |F(x)| <
∞for µ-a.e.(almost everywhere) x ∈X.
Then one can deﬁne a linear
operator MF on L2(X, dµ) as follows:
D(MF ) :=

f ∈L2(X, dµ)

Z
X
|F(x)f(x)|2dµ(x) < ∞

,
(MF f)(x) := F(x)f(x),
µ-a.e.x ∈X, f ∈D(MF ).
The operator MF is called the multiplication operator by the function
F.
 

Theory of Linear Operators
25
The subset
ess.ran(F) := {λ ∈C|∀ε > 0, µ({x ∈X| |F(x) −λ| < ε}) > 0}
is called the essential range of F. It is easy to see that ess.ran(F) is
closed.
Theorem 1.15. The multiplication operator MF is a densely deﬁned closed
operator. Moreover, the following (i)–(iii) hold:
(i) (MF )∗= MF ∗.
(ii) If F is real-valued, then F is self-adjoint.
(iii) σ(MF ) = ess.ran(F).
Proof. The implication (i) =⇒(ii) is obvious. For proofs of (i) and (iii),
see standard textbooks on linear operators on Hilbert spaces, e.g., [Arai
and Ezawa (1999a), pp.126–130].
In applications, the following fact on the essential range of F is useful:
Proposition 1.23. Consider the case where X is a topological space, Σ is
the Borel ﬁeld generated by all the open sets of X and, for all non-empty
open sets O ⊂X, µ(O) > 0. Then, for all continuous functions F : X →C,
ess.ran(F) = F(X).
In the case where (X, Σ) = (Rd, Bd), Theorem 1.15 and Proposition
1.23 immediately yield the following result:
Corollary 1.2. Let F ∈C(Rd) (the set of complex-valued continuous func-
tions on Rd). Then the multiplication operator MF on L2(Rd) is a densely
deﬁned closed operator and
σ(MF ) = F(Rd).
Moreover, if F is real-valued, then MF is self-adjoint.
1.5.4
Spectral measures and functional calculus
For each d ∈N, we denote by Bd the Borel ﬁeld of the d-dimensional
Euclidean vector space Rd. Let H be a Hilbert space and P(H ) be the
set of all orthogonal projections on H . A mapping E : Bd →P(H ); Bd ∋
B 7→E(B) ∈P(H ) is called a d-dimensional spectral measure or a
d-dimensional resolution of identity7 if the following (E.1) and (E.2)
hold:
7It is called also a projection-valued measure.
 

26
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(E.1) E(∅) = 0, E(Rd) = I.
(E.2) (complete additivity) If Bn ∈Bd, n ∈N and Bn ∩Bm = ∅(n ̸= m),
then
E(∪∞
n=1Bn) = s- lim
N→∞
N
X
n=1
E(Bn),
where s-lim means strong limit.
It is not so diﬃcult to prove that (E.1) and (E.2) imply
(E.3) For all B1, B2 ∈Bd, E(B1)E(B2) = E(B1 ∩B2).
Hence, in particular, E(B1) commutes with E(B2):
E(B1)E(B2) = E(B2)E(B1),
B1, B2 ∈Bd.
Thus the set {E(B)|B ∈Bd} is a family of commuting orthogonal projec-
tions on H satisfying (E.1)–(E.3). Property (E.2) implies the following:
(E.4) (monotonicity) If A ⊂B, A, B ∈Bd, then E(A) ≤E(B).8
It follows from (E.1) and (E.2) that, for every monotone increasing
sequence {Rn}∞
n=1 of Borel sets Rn ∈Bd, n ∈N such that ∪∞
n=1Rn = Rd,
s- lim
n→∞E(Rn) = I.
(1.16)
Indeed, putting B1 = R1, Bn := Rn \ Rn−1 (n ≥2), one has Bn ∩Bm = ∅,
n ̸= m, and ∪∞
n=1Bn = Rd. Hence, by (E.2) and (E.1),
s- lim
N→∞
N
X
n=1
E(Bn) = E(Rd) = I.
But, by (E.2) again, PN
n=1 E(Bn) = E(RN). Hence (1.16) holds.
The smallest closed set C0 ∈Bd such that E(C0) = I is called the
support of E. We write C0 = supp E. Hence E(supp E) = I.
The next proposition may be used to identify supp E.
Proposition 1.24. Let λ ∈Rd and, for r > 0,
Br(λ) := {µ ∈Rd| |µ −λ| < r},
the d-dimensional open ball with center λ and radius r. Then λ ∈supp E
if and only if, for every ε > 0, E(Bε(λ)) ̸= 0.
8If A ⊂B, then B = A∪(B \A) and hence, by (E.2) and the fact that every orthogonal
projection is non-negative, E(B) = E(A) + E(B \ A) ≥E(A).
 

Theory of Linear Operators
27
Proof. Suppose that there exists a constant δ > 0 such that E(Bδ(λ)) = 0.
Then E(Bδ(λ)c) = I.
Since Bδ(λ)c is closed, it follows that supp E ⊂
Bδ(λ)c. Hence λ ̸∈supp E. Thus, if λ ∈supp E, then, for every ε > 0,
E(Bε(λ)) ̸= 0.
Suppose that λ ̸∈supp E. Then, since (supp E)c is an open set, there
exists a constant δ > 0 such that Bδ(λ) ⊂(supp E)c. Since E((supp E)c) =
0, it follows from (E.4) that E(Bδ(λ)) = 0.
For each Ψ ∈H , the mapping µΨ : Bd →[0, ∞) deﬁned by
µΨ(B) := ⟨Ψ, E(B)Ψ⟩= ∥E(B)Ψ∥2,
B ∈Bd,
is a ﬁnite measure on the measurable space (Rd, Bd) with
µΨ(B) ≤∥Ψ∥2.
We remark that, for all unit vectors Ψ ∈H (i.e., ∥Ψ∥= 1), µΨ(Rd) = 1.
Hence µΨ is a probability measure on (Rd, Bd).9 Therefore (Rd, Bd, µΨ) is
a probability space.10
For a Borel measurable function f : Rd →C ∪{±∞}, the Lebesgue
integral
R
Rd fdµΨ ∈C ∪{±∞} of f with respect to µΨ (if it exists) is
written as
R
Rd f(λ)d ⟨Ψ, E(λ)Ψ⟩or
R
Rd f(λ)d∥E(λ)Ψ∥2:
Z
Rd f(λ)d ⟨Ψ, E(λ)Ψ⟩:=
Z
Rd f(λ)d∥E(λ)Ψ∥2 :=
Z
Rd f(λ)dµΨ(λ).
For each pair (Φ, Ψ) ∈H × H , the mapping µΦ,Ψ : Bd →C deﬁned
by
µΦ,Ψ(B) := ⟨Φ, E(B)Ψ⟩,
B ∈Bd,
is a complex-valued measure. Note that
µΦ,Ψ(B) = ⟨E(B)Φ, E(B)Ψ⟩.
Hence, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
|µΦ,Ψ(B)| ≤∥E(B)Φ∥∥E(B)Ψ∥.

10A measure space (X, Σ, µ) with a probability measure µ is called a probability space.

TE: {Borel measurable functions on Rd} −→L(H )
Fig. 1.4
Mapping TE
The correspondence TE : f 7→TE(f) deﬁnes a mapping from the set of
Borel measurable functions on Rd to L(H ) (the set of linear operators on
H ). It is an operator-valued functional. It is shown that TE obeys some
laws. Analysis of this kind of mappings is called operational calculus or
functional calculus.
The next theorem summarizes some fundamental properties of the map-
ping TE.
Theorem 1.16. Let f and g be Borel measurable functions on Rd.
(i) For all B ∈Bd, E(B)TE(f) ⊂TE(f)E(B).
(ii) The domain D(TE(f)) is dense in H if and only if E({λ| |f(λ)| =
+∞}) = 0. In this case, TE(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator
and TE(f)∗= TE(f ∗).
(iii) If f is continuous, then TE(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator
and TE(f)∗= TE(f ∗).
(iv) If f is bounded on supp E, i.e., Cf := supλ∈supp E |f(λ)| < ∞, then
TE(f) ∈B(H ) and ∥TE(f)∥≤Cf.
(v) If |f(λ)| = 1 for all λ ∈supp E, then TE(f) is unitary.
(vi) If f is real-valued and E({λ ∈Rd| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0, then TE(f) is
self-adjoint. In particular, if f is a real-valued continuous function
on Rd, then TE(f) is self-adjoint.
(vii) TE(f)+TE(g) ⊂TE(f +g). In particular, if g is bounded on supp E,
then TE(f) + TE(g) = TE(f + g).
(viii) D(TE(fg)) ∩D(TE(g))
=
D(TE(f)TE(g)) and TE(f)TE(g)
⊂
TE(fg). In particular, if g is bounded on supp E, then TE(f)TE(g) =
TE(fg).
(ix) If fn
: Rd
→C ∪{±∞} (n ∈N) is Borel measurable with
supn∈N,λ∈supp E |fn(λ)| < ∞and limn→∞fn(λ) = f(λ), λ ∈supp E,
then TE(fn), TE(f) ∈B(H ) and s-limn→∞TE(fn) = TE(f).
(x) (spectral mapping theorem) If f is continuous on Rd, then
σ(TE(f)) = {f(λ)|λ ∈supp E},
(1.18)
where σ(TE(f)) is the spectrum of TE(f).

Corollary 1.3.
(i) Let f ∈C(Rd) and |f(λ)| > 0, λ ∈Rd. Then TE(f) is injective and
TE(f)−1 = TE(1/f). Moreover,
 TE(f)−1∗= TE(f ∗)−1.
(ii) Let f ∈C(Rd) and f(λ) > 0, λ ∈Rd. Then TE(f) is an injective
non-negative self-adjoint operator and TE(f)−1 = TE(1/f).
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈ker TE(f). Then
0 = ∥TE(f)Ψ∥2 =
Z
Rd |f(λ)|2d∥E(λ)Ψ∥2.
Since |f(λ)|2 > 0 for all λ, it follows that ∥E(Rd)Ψ∥2 = 0. By this fact and
E(Rd) = I, we obtain Ψ = 0. Hence ker TE(f) = {0}. Therefore TE(f) is
injective.
By Theorem 1.16(viii), TE(f)TE(1/f) ⊂I. Hence, by Proposition 1.1,
TE(1/f) ⊂TE(f)−1. Let Ψ ∈D(TE(f)−1) and Φ := TE(f)−1Ψ. Then
Φ ∈D(TE(f)) and Ψ = TE(f)Φ. We have
∥E(B)Ψ∥2 =
Z
B
|f(λ)|2d∥E(λ)Φ∥2 < ∞,
B ∈Bd.
Hence

|f(λ)|2 d∥E(λ)Ψ∥2 =

|f(λ)|2 · |f(λ)|2d∥E(λ)Φ∥2 = ∥Φ∥2 < ∞.
Hence Ψ ∈D(TE(1/f)).
Therefore D(TE(f)−1) ⊂D(TE(1/f)).
Thus
TE(1/f) = TE(f)−1.
By
the

result
and
Theorem
1.16(iii),
(TE(f)−1)∗
=
TE(1/f)∗= TE(1/f ∗) = TE(f ∗)−1 (note that |f(λ)∗| = |f(λ)| > 0, λ ∈
Rd).
(ii) The self-adjointness of TE(f) follows from Theorem 1.16(vi). For
all Ψ ∈D(TE(f)), we have
⟨Ψ, TE(f)Ψ⟩=
Z
Rd f(λ)d ⟨Ψ, E(λ)Ψ⟩.
Since f(λ) > 0 for all λ ∈R, the right hand side is non-negative. Hence
TE(f) is non-negative. The other properties of TE(f) follow from an appli-
cation of (i).

Spectral measure induced by the pair of a spectral
measure and a Borel measurable mapping
Given a d-dimensional spectral measure E and a Borel measurable mapping
u : Rd →Rℓ(ℓ∈N), one can deﬁne a mapping E ◦u−1 : Bℓ→P(H ) by
(E ◦u−1)(C) := E(u−1(C)),
C ∈Bℓ,
 

Theory of Linear Operators

where u−1(C) denotes the inverse image of C by u:
u−1(C) := {ω ∈Rd|u(ω) ∈C}.
Proposition 1.25. The mapping E◦u−1 is an ℓ-dimensional spectral mea-
sure.
Proof. It is obvious that (E ◦u−1)(∅) = 0 and (E ◦u−1)(Rℓ) = I. Let
Cn ∈Bℓ, n ∈N and Cn ∩Cm = ∅(n ̸= m).
(E ◦u−1)(∪∞

Hence (E ◦u−1) is completely additive.

Z
Rℓg(λ)d(Ψ, (E ◦u−1)(λ)Φ),
provided that one of these integrals exists.
Proof. Similar to proof of the well known formula for an ordinary measure
(see Lemma 1.3 below).
1.5.6
Spectral theorem
For each self-adjoint operator S on a Hilbert space H , there exists a unique
one-dimensional spectral measure ES such that
S =
Z
R
λ dES(λ).
This fact is referred as the spectral theorem of a self-adjoint operator.
The spectral measure ES is called the spectral measure of S.
Applying Theorem 1.16(x) with d = 1 and f(λ) = λ (λ ∈R), we obtain
σ(S) = supp ES.
(1.19)
One of the implications of property (1.19) is the following fact:
Proposition 1.26. Let λ ∈R. Then λ ∈σ(S) if and only if, for all ε > 0,
ES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) ̸= 0.
 

32
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. A simple application of Proposition 1.24.
Proposition 1.27. A real number λ is an eigenvalue of S (i.e., λ ∈σp(S))
if and only if ES({λ}) ̸= 0. In that case, RanES({λ}) = ker(S −λ).
Proof. Let λ ∈σp(S) and Ψ ∈ker(S −λ), Ψ ̸= 0.
Then SΨ = λΨ.
By the functional calculus, 0 = ∥SΨ −λΨ∥2 =
R
R |µ −λ|2d∥ES(µ)Ψ∥2.
Hence ∥ES(R \ {λ})Ψ∥2 = 0. Therefore ES(R \ {λ})Ψ = 0. The left hand
side is equal to Ψ −ES({λ})Ψ. Hence ES({λ})Ψ = Ψ. This means that
ES({λ}) ̸= 0 and ker(S −λ) ⊂RanES({λ}) · · · (∗).
Conversely, let ES({λ}) ̸= 0. Then there exists a non-zero vector Ψ ∈
RanES({λ}). Hence ES({λ})Ψ = Ψ. Therefore, for all Borel sets B ⊂R,
ES(B)Ψ = ES({λ}∩B)Ψ. Using this property and the functional calculus,
we have ∥SΨ−λΨ∥2 =
R
R |µ−λ|2d∥ES(µ)Ψ∥2 = 0. Hence SΨ = λΨ. Thus
λ ∈σp(S)
The discussion of the preceding paragraph also shows that RanES({λ})
⊂ker(S −λ). This relation and (∗) imply RanES({λ}) = ker(S −λ).
Proposition 1.28. If λ ∈σ(S) is an isolated point of σ(S), then λ ∈
σp(S).
Proof. We have
ES({λ}) + ES(σ(S) \ {λ}) = ES(σ(S)) = I.
Suppose that ES({λ}) = 0. Then ES(σ(S) \ {λ}) = I. Under the present
assumption, σ(S) \ {λ} is a closed set. Hence supp ES ⊂σ(S) \ {λ}. But
this contradicts (1.19). Hence ES({λ}) ̸= 0. Thus, by Proposition 1.27, λ
is an eigenvalue of S.
The set
σess(S) := σ(S) \ σd(S)
is called the essential spectrum of S, where σd(S) is the discrete spectrum
of S (see Subsection 1.2.3). Hence we have
σ(S) = σess(S) ∪σd(S),
σess(S) ∩σd(S) = ∅.
(1.20)
It follows that, if dim H < ∞, then σess(S) = ∅. Hence the concept
of essential spectrum is meaningful only if the Hilbert space H is inﬁnite
dimensional.
 

Theory of Linear Operators
33
Proposition 1.29.
(i) The essential spectrum σess(S) is a closed set in R.
(ii) A real number λ is in σess(S) if and only if, for all ε
>
0,
dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) = ∞.
Proof. (i) Let λn ∈σess(S) and limn→∞λn = λ. Suppose that λ ∈σd(S).
Then there exists a δ > 0 such that (λ −δ, λ + δ) ∩(σ(S) \ {λ}) = {λ}.
But, for all suﬃciently large n, λn ∈(λ −δ, λ + δ) ∩(σ(S) \ {λ}), which is
a contradiction. Hence λ ∈σess(S). Thus σess(S) is closed.
(ii) Let λ ∈σess(S). Then the following two cases (a) and (b) should be
considered:
(a) The case where λ is an eigenvalue of S
In this case, λ is non-isolated or has inﬁnite multiplicity.
Suppose that λ is a non-isolated eigenvalue of S ﬁrst. Then there exists
a sequence {λn}∞
n=1 (λn ̸= λm, n ̸= m) such that λn ∈σ(S), n ≥1, and
limn→∞λn = λ.
For each n, there exists an εn > 0 such that (λn −
εn, λn + εn) ∩(λm −εm, λm + εm) = ∅for n ̸= m. By Proposition 1.26,
dim RanES((λn −εn, λn + εn)) ≥1. For any ε > 0, there exists an n0 ∈N
such that (λ −ε, λ + ε) ⊃∪n≥n0(λn −εn, λn + εn). Hence, by Proposition
1.16,
dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) ≥
∞
X
n=n0
dim RanES((λn −εn, λn + εn)) = ∞.
We next consider the case where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ is
inﬁnite. In this case, for all ε > 0,
dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) ≥dim RanES({λ}) = ∞.
(b) The case where λ is not an eigenvalue of S
In this case, by Proposition 1.28, λ is not an isolated point of σ(S).
Hence there exists a sequence {λn}∞
n=1 in σ(S) such that λn →λ (n →∞).
Therefore, in the same way as in the proof of the ﬁrst case of (a), we obtain
the desired result.
Example 1.2. Let S be a closed symmetric operator on H with the fol-
lowing properties: (i) σ(S) = σp(S) = {En}n∈N (En ̸= Em if n ̸= m); (ii)
H = ⊕∞
n=1 ker(S−En) (note that En ∈R). Let dn := dim ker(S−En) ≤∞
and {Ψnj}j=1,...,dn be a CONS of ker(S −En).
Then (ii) implies that
{Ψnj|n ∈N, j = 1, . . . , dn} is a CONS of H and SΨnj = EnΨjn. Hence,
for all η ∈H , η = P∞
n=1

It is easy to see that Ξ ∈D(S) and (S −i)Ξ = Φ.
Hence Ran(S −i) = H . Similarly one can show that Ran(S + i) = H .
Therefore, by a basic criterion for self-adjointness of a symmetric operator,
S is self-adjoint.
Now let us ﬁnd the spectral measure of S. Let Pn be the orthogonal
projection onto the eigenspace ker(S −En). Then (1.21) is equivalent to
SΨ =
∞
X
n=1
EnPnΨ,
Ψ ∈D(S).
This suggests that the operator ES(·) deﬁned by
ES(B) :=

B ∈B1
may be the spectral measure of S. Here P
En∈B means the sum over n
such that En ∈B (if {n ∈N|En ∈B} = ∅, then P
En∈B(·) := 0). Indeed,
one can prove that ES(·) is the spectral measure of S (Problem 9).
By the operational calculus stated in the preceding subsection, for each
Borel measurable function f on R, the operator
˜f(S) := TES(f) =
Z
R
f(λ)dES(λ)
(1.22)
is deﬁned. The correspondence : S 7→˜f(S) gives an operator-valued func-
tion on the set of self-adjoint operators on H .
˜f: { self-adjoint operators on H } −→L(H )
Fig. 1.5
Mapping ˜f
In what follows, following the conventional notation, we simply write
f(S) for ˜f(S):
f(S) := ˜f(S).
Theorem 1.16 implies the following:
Theorem 1.18. Let f and g be Borel measurable functions on R.

(i) For all B ∈B1, ES(B)f(S) ⊂f(S)ES(B).
(ii) The domain D(f(S)) is dense in H
if and only if ES({λ
∈
R| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0. In this case, f(S) is a densely deﬁned closed
operator and f(S)∗= f ∗(S), where f ∗(S) :=
R
R f(λ)∗dES(λ).
(iii) If f is continuous on R, then f(S) is a densely deﬁned closed operator
and f(S)∗= f ∗(S).
(iv) If f is bounded on supp ES, i.e., Kf := supλ∈supp ES |f(λ)| < ∞,
then f(S) ∈B(H ) and ∥f(S)∥≤Kf.
(v) If |f(λ)| = 1 for all λ ∈supp ES, then f(S) is unitary.
(vi) If f is real-valued and ES({λ ∈R| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0, then f(S) is
self-adjoint. In particular, if f is a real-valued continuous function
on R, then f(S) is self-adjoint.
(vii) f(S) + g(S) ⊂(f + g)(S). In particular, if g is bounded on supp ES,
then f(S) + g(S) = (f + g)(S).
(viii) D((fg)(S)) ∩D(g(S)) = D(f(S)g(S)) and f(S)g(S) ⊂(fg)(S). In
particular, if g is bounded on supp ES, then f(S)g(S) = (fg)(S).
(ix) If fn

N) is Borel measurable with
supn∈N,λ∈supp ES |fn(λ)|

=
f(λ), λ
∈
supp ES, then fn(S), f(S) ∈B(H ) and s- limn→∞fn(S) = f(S).
(x) (spectral mapping theorem) If f is continuous on R, then
σ(f(S)) = {f(λ)|λ ∈supp ES}.
For a function f : Rd →C such that |f(λ)| > 0, λ ∈Rd, we deﬁne a
function 1/f : Rd →C by
1
f (λ) :=
1
f(λ),
λ ∈Rd.
Corollary 1.3 takes the following form in terms of f(S).
Corollary 1.4.
(i) Let f ∈C(R) and |f(λ)| > 0, λ ∈R.
Then f(S) is injective and
f(S)−1 = 1
f (S). Moreover, (f(S)−1)∗= (f ∗(S))−1.
(ii) Let f ∈C(R) and f(λ) > 0, λ ∈Rd. Then f(S) is an injective non-
negative self-adjoint operator and f(S)−1 = 1
f (S).
Theorem 1.19. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H and f be a real-
valued continuous function on R. Then ES ◦f −1 is the spectral measure of
the self-adjoint operator f(S).

By this equation and the uniqueness of the
spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator, we conclude that ES ◦f −1 is
the spectral measure of f(S).
1.5.7
The spectral measure of a multiplication operator
We consider the multiplication operator MF on L2(X, dµ) in Subsection
1.5.3 in the case where F is real-valued. Then MF is self-adjoint. In view
of the spectral theorem, it is natural to ask what form the spectral measure
EMF of MF does take.
For a subset A ⊂X, we denote the characteristic function of A by χA:
x ∈A =⇒χA(x) = 1; x ̸∈A =⇒χA(x) = 0. It is easy to see that, for all
B ∈B1, the operator
PF (B) := MχF −1(B),
the multiplication operator by the function χF −1(B), is an orthogonal
projection on L2(X, dµ) and the mapping PF : B1 ∋B 7→PF (B) ∈
P(L2(X, dµ)) is a one-dimensional spectral measure.
We recall a well known lemma.
Lemma 1.3. Let ν be a complex-valued measure on (X, Σ) and
νF (B) := ν(F −1(B)),
B ∈B1.
Then νF is a complex-valued measure on (R, B1). Moreover, for all f :
R →C Borel measurable,
Z
X
f(F(x))dν(x) =
Z
R
f(λ)dνF (λ),
provided that one of the integrals exists.
Now we can prove the following fact:
Theorem 1.20. EMF = PF .
Proof. Let f ∈D(MF ), g ∈L2(X, dµ) and
ν(E) :=
Z
E
g(x)∗f(x)dµ(x) = ⟨g, χEf⟩,
E ∈Σ.

Then ν is a complex-valued measure on (X, Σ) and

F(x)dν(x).
By Lemma 1.3, we haveZ

F(x)dν(x) =

Hence

By the uniqueness in the spectral theorem, EMF = PF .
1.5.8
Strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups
For each t ∈R, we deﬁne ft : R →C by ft(λ) := eitλ, λ ∈R. Obviously
|ft(λ)| = 1. Hence, by Theorem 1.18(v), ft(S) is a unitary operator. This
unitary operator is usually written as eitS:
eitS :=
Z
R
eitλdES(λ).
Basic properties of this operator are summarized as follows:
Theorem 1.21.
(i) (group property) ei0S = I, ei(t+s)S = eitSeisS = eisSeitS, s, t ∈R.
(ii) (strong continuity) The mapping:R ∋t 7→eitS is strongly continuous,
i.e., for all Ψ ∈H and t ∈R, limt′→t eit′SΨ = eitSΨ.11
(iii) (strong diﬀerentiability12) For all Ψ ∈D(S), eitSΨ is strongly diﬀer-
entiable in t and its strong derivative is given as follows:
d
dteitSΨ = iSeitSΨ = ieitSSΨ.
In particular,
SΨ = −i lim

11In general, a mapping ψ from R to a Hilbert space X (ψ : R ∋t 7→ψ(t) ∈X )—
an X -valued function on R—is said to be strongly continuous if, for all t ∈R,
limε→0 ∥ψ(t + ε) −ψ(t)∥X = 0.
12Let K ⊂R be an interval and Φ : K →H ; K ∋t 7→Φ(t) ∈H . Then Φ is said to
be strongly diﬀerentiable on K if, for each t ∈K, Φ′(t) := limt+ε∈K,ε→0[Φ(t + ε) −
Φ(t)]/ε exists. In that case, the mapping Φ′ : K →H is called the strong derivative
of Φ. One writes Φ′(t) = dΦ(t)

The family {eitS}t∈R is a realization of a general concept deﬁned as
follows.
A family {U(t)}t∈R of unitary operators on a Hilbert space H is called
a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group if it has the
following properties:
(U.1) (group property) U(t+s) = U(t)U(s), t, s ∈R (it follows that U(0) =
I);
(U.2) (strong continuity) s- lims→0 U(t + s) = U(t), t ∈R.
For this object, the following important theorem holds13:
Theorem 1.22 (Stone’s theorem). For each strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group {U(t)}t∈R, there exists a unique self-adjoint oper-
ator S such that U(t) = eitS, t ∈R.
The self-adjoint operator S in this theorem is called the inﬁnitesimal
generator or generator of {U(t)}t∈R.
Thus there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between a self-adjoint operator and a strongly continuous
one-parameter unitary group. The family {eitS}t∈R is called the strongly
continuous one-parameter unitary group generated by S.
The following theorem is sometimes useful to prove the essential self-
adjointness of a given symmetric operator.
Theorem 1.23. Let {U(t)}t∈R be a strongly continuous one-parameter uni-
tary group on a Hilbert space H and T be a symmetric operator on H .
Suppose that there exists a dense subspace D ⊂D(T ) such that, for all
t ∈R, U(t)D ⊂D(T ) and, for all Ψ ∈D(T ),
T Ψ = −i lim

Then T is essentially self-adjoint and U(t) = eitT , t ∈R.

Theorem 1.24 (unitary covariance of functional calculus). Let
S
be a self-adjoint operator on H and W : H →K (a Hilbert space) be
unitary. Then, for all Borel measurable function f on R,
Wf(S)W −1 = f(WSW −1).
(1.23)
Remark 1.4. The unitary transformation WSW −1 of S is a self-adjoint
operator on K .
Corollary 1.5. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H and W : H →K
be unitary. Then, for all t ∈R,
WeitSW −1 = eitWSW −1.
Proof. We need only to take f(λ) = eitλ, λ ∈R in (1.23).
1.5.10
Some inequalities
For a complex number z and a subset D ⊂C, we deﬁne
dist(z, D) := inf
λ∈D |z −λ|.
(1.24)
It is called the distance between z and D.
Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H . An elementary application of
property (1.19) is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 1.25. For all z ∈ρ(S),
∥(S −z)−1∥≤
1
dist(z, σ(S)).
(1.25)

In general, for a linear operator A on a Hilbert space, the subspace

40
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is an invariant subspace of A, i.e., AC∞(A) ⊂C∞(A).
The subspace
C∞(A) is called the C∞-domain of A. An element in C∞(A) is called a
C∞-vector for A.
Lemma 1.4. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H and
C∞
0 (S) := ∪∞
n=1RanES([−n, n]).
Then:
(i) C∞
0 (S) ⊂C∞(S).
(ii) C∞
0 (S) is dense in H .
(iii) C∞(S) is dense in H .
(iv) For all p ∈N, C∞
0 (S) is a core for Sp.
(v) Let S ≥0. Then, for all α > 0, C∞(S) ⊂D(Sα) and C∞
0 (S) is a
core for Sα.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈C∞
0 (S).
Then there is an n ∈N such that
ES([−n, n])Ψ = Ψ. Hence, for all k ∈N,

Therefore Ψ ∈D(Sk). Thus Ψ ∈C∞(S).
(ii) By (1.16), for all Ψ ∈H , limn→∞ES([−n, n])Ψ = Ψ. Hence C∞
0 (S)
is dense in H .
(iii) This follows from (i) and (ii).
(iv) Let Ψ ∈D(Sp) and Ψn := ES([−n, n])Ψ. Then Ψn ∈C∞
0 (S) and
Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). Moreover,
∥SpΨn −SpΨ∥2 =

|λ|>n
|λ|2pd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
By applying the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, the integral on
the right hand side converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence SpΨn →SpΨ (n →

0 (S) is a core for Sp.
(v) Let Ψ ∈C∞(S). Then, for all p ∈N,

There exists a p ∈N such that p ≥α. Hence

λ2ℓd∥ES(λ)Ψn∥2 ≤n2ℓ∥Ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence Ψn ∈D(Sℓ). Moreover, Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). We have
∥SkΨn −SkΨ∥2 =
Z
|λ|>n
λ2kd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
Since
R
R λ2kd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞, the right hand side on the above equation
converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence SkΨn →SkΨ (n →∞). This means that
D(Sℓ) is a core of Sk.
(iii) This follows from an application of Proposition 1.10.
An extension of Proposition 1.30 to the case where ℓand k are replaced
by positive real numbers is given as follows:
Proposition 1.31. Let S be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H
and α, β be positive real numbers satisfying 0 < α < β. Then the following
(i)–(iii) hold:

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(i) D(Sβ) ⊂D(Sα) and, for all Ψ ∈D(Sβ),
∥SαΨ∥≤∥Ψ∥+ ∥SβΨ∥.
(ii) D(Sβ) is a core of Sα.
(iii) Every core of Sβ is a core of Sα.
Proof. This proposition can be proved in a way parallel to the proof of
Proposition 1.30. Therefore to give the details of the proof is left to the
reader (Problem 10).
Proposition 1.32. Let S be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H .
Then
∥S1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥Ψ∥2 = ∥(S + 1)1/2Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈D(S1/2).
(1.28)
Proof. This follows from a simple functional calculus using the spectral
representation (S +c)1/2 =
R
[0,∞)(λ+c)1/2dES(λ) (c ≥0), where ES is the
spectral measure of S.14
Proposition 1.33. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H .
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(S),
∥eiSΨ −Ψ∥≤∥SΨ∥.
(1.29)
Proof. By the functional calculus, we have
∥eiSΨ −Ψ∥2 =
Z
R
|eiλ −1|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
It is easy to see that |eiλ −1| ≤|λ|, λ ∈R. Hence
∥eiSΨ −Ψ∥2 ≤
Z
R
|λ|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 = ∥SΨ∥2.
Thus (1.29) follows.
The following theorem also is an important general fact in the theory
of self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 1.26. Let H0 and H be non-negative self-adjoint operators on a
Hilbert space H such that D(H) ⊂D(H0) and
∥H0Ψ∥≤a∥HΨ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H),
(1.30)
where a, b ≥0 are constants. Then D(H1/2) ⊂D(H1/2
0
) and, for any ε > 0,
there exists a constant cε ≥0 such that
∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥≤
√
a + ε∥H1/2Ψ∥+ cε∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H1/2).
(1.31)
14Another proof is as follows: (i) one proves (1.28) on D(S) (this is easy); (ii) using
the fact that D(S) is a core of D(S1/2) (Proposition 1.31(ii)), one extends by a limiting
argument the equality obtained in (i) to all Ψ ∈D(S1/2).
 

Theory of Linear Operators
43
Proof. Let t > 0 be such that ta < 1. Then, by (1.30), −tH0 is H-bounded
with a relative upper bound less than 1. Hence, by the Kato-Rellich theorem
(Theorem 1.14) , H −tH0 is self-adjoint and bounded from below. Hence
there exists a constant γt ≥0 such that H −tH0 ≥−γt. This implies that
t∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥2 ≤∥H1/2Ψ∥2 + γt∥Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈D(H).
Since D(H) is a core of H1/2 by Proposition 1.31(ii), it follows from a
limiting argument that this inequality extends to all Ψ ∈D(H1/2), implying
that D(H1/2) ⊂D(H1/2
0
) at the same time.
For any ε > 0, we take
t = 1/(a + ε) and set cε :=
p
γt/t. Then we obain (1.31).
1.6
Operators of Exponential Type
Let H be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then,
for each z ∈C, one can deﬁne a linear operator of exponential type
e−zH :=
Z
R
e−zλdEH(λ),
where EH denotes the spectral measure of H. To be precise, we have
D(e−zH) =

R
e−zλd ⟨Φ, EH(λ)Ψ⟩, Φ ∈H , Ψ ∈D(e−zH).
With regard to the operator e−zH, there are two important cases in
connection with quantum physics. Namely, the case z = it with t ∈R and
z = β with β > 0. By Theorem 1.18(v), the former case gives the unitary
operator e−itH. If H denotes the Hamiltonian of a quantum system and
t is the time parameter, then e−itH/ℏdescribes the time development of
state vectors of the quantum system, where ℏ> 0 is a parameter denoting
the reduced Planck constant (Dirac constant).
Since the function : R ∋λ 7→e−βλ (β > 0) is a real-valued continuous
function on R, it follows from Theorem 1.18(vi) that e−βH is self-adjoint
and non-negative. But it is not necessarily bounded. Indeed, the following
proposition holds:
Proposition 1.34. Let H be a self-adjoint operator on H .
(i) If H is not bounded from below. Then, for all β >, e−βH is unbounded.
(ii) If H is neither bounded from below nor bounded from above, then, for
all t ∈R \ {0}, etH is unbounded.
 

44
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) Since H is not bounded from below, for each n ∈N, there exists
a number Rn > n such that EH([−Rn, −n]) ̸= 0. Hence there exists a unit
vector Ψn ∈RanEH([−Rn, −n]). Then
Z
R
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψn∥2 =
Z
[−Rn,−n]
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2 ≤e2βRn < ∞.
Hence Ψn ∈D(e−βH). The above equation implies also that
∥e−βHΨn∥2 =
Z
R
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψn∥2 ≥e2βn →∞(n →∞).
Hence e−βH is unbounded.
(ii) By (i), etH is unbounded for all t < 0. Let t > 0. Then we write
etH = e−t(−H). By the present assumption, −H is not bounded from below.
Hence, by (i) again, e−t(−H) is unbounded. Thus etH is unbounded.
As is shown in the next lemma, if H is bounded from below, then e−βH
is bounded for all β ≥0.
In this case, if H denotes the Hamiltonian
of a quantum system and β > 0 is the inverse temperature parameter,
then Tr e−βH, the trace of e−βH, gives the partition function of the
quantum system in a thermal equilibrium, provided that e−βH is a trace
class operator.
Let
C+ := {z ∈C | Re z ≥0}.
(1.32)
Lemma 1.5. Suppose that H is bounded from below.
(i) For all β ≥0, e−βH is a bounded non-negative self-adjoint operator
and
∥e−βH∥= e−βE0(H)
(1.33)
where
E0(H) := inf σ(H).
(ii) For all z ∈C+, e−zH is bounded and
∥e−zH∥= e−(Re z)E0(H).
(1.34)
(iii) (strong continuity) The operator-valued function:
z
7→e−zH is
strongly continuous on C+.
(iv) (semi-group property) For all z, z′ ∈C+, z + z′ ∈C+ and
e−(z+z′)H = e−zHe−z′H = e−z′He−zH.
(1.35)
 

Theory of Linear Operators

(v) For all Ψ ∈D(H), the H -valued function:z 7→Ψ(z) := e−zHΨ is
analytic in {z ∈C | Re z > 0} and continuous on C+. Moreover, it
satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
dΨ(z)
dz
= −HΨ(z),
(1.36)
where the derivative is taken in the strong sense.
Proof. (i) We set c := E0(H). One has supp EH = σ(H) ⊂[c, ∞). Hence,
for any Ψ ∈H ,
Z
R
|e−βλ|2d∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2 =
Z
[c,∞)
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2
≤e−2βc∥Ψ∥2.
This implies that D(e−βH) = H and ∥e−βH∥≤e−βc.
Since c ∈σ(H), for any ε > 0, EH([c, c + ε)) ̸= 0. Hence there exists a
unit vector Ψε ∈Ran EH([c, c + ε)). Hence
∥e−βHΨε∥2 =
Z
[c,c+ε)
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψε∥2 ≥e−2β(c+ε).
This implies that e−β(c+ε) ≤∥e−βH∥. Taking the limit ε →0, we obtain
e−βc ≤∥e−βH∥. Thus (1.33) holds.
(ii) Let z = β + it ∈C+ (β ≥0, t ∈R). Then, by a simple application
of Theorem 1.18(viii),
e−zH = e−βHe−itH
(1.37)
Since e−itH is unitary, it follows from (i) that e−zH is bounded and
∥e−zH∥= ∥e−βH∥= e−βE0(H).
(iii) By (1.37) and the strong continuity of e−itH in t ∈R, it is suﬃcient
to show that e−βH is strongly continuous in β ≥0. Let Ψ ∈H . Then, for
all β ≥0 and ε ∈(0, δ) (δ > 0 is a constant), we have by (ii)
∥e−(β+ε)HΨ −e−βHΨ∥= ∥e−βH(e−εH −1)Ψ∥.
Hence
∥e−(β+ε)HΨ −e−βHΨ∥2 =
Z
[c,∞)
e−2βλ|e−ελ −1|2d∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2.
We have limε→0 e−2βλ|e−ελ −1|2 = 0 for all λ ≥c and
|e−ελ −1|2 = |e−ε(λ−c)e−εc −1|2 ≤(e|c|δ + 1)2, λ ≥c.
Hence, by the dominated convergence theorem, we see that
lim
ε→0 ∥e−(β+ε)HΨ −e−βHΨ∥2 = 0.
 

46
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence e−βH is right continuous in β ≥0. Similarly one can show that e−βH
is left continuous in β > 0 (note that, for 0 < ε < β, e−(β−ε)H −e−βH =
e−(β−ε)H(1 −e−εH)).
(iv) This follows from a simple application of Theorem 1.18(viii).
(v) Let Ψ ∈D(H). Then, by using the functional calculus, one can
show that
s-

Re h>0,h→0
e−hH −1
h
Ψ = −HΨ.
(1.38)
Let z ∈C with Re z > 0 be ﬁxed arbitrarily and h ∈C, h ̸= 0 such that
Re (z + h) > 0. Then it is easy to see that Ψ(z) ∈D(H). By (iv), we have
Ψ(z + h) −Ψ(z)

e−(−h)H −1

Ψ(z + h) for Re (−h) > 0
Using these expressions and (1.38) as well as (iii), we see that
lim
h→0
Ψ(z + h) −Ψ(z)
h
= −HΨ(z).
Hence Ψ(z) is analytic in {z ∈C | Re z > 0} and (1.36) holds.
Lemma 1.5 shows that, if H is bounded from below, then {e−βH}β≥0 is
a strongly continuous one-parameter semi-group on H .15 In the context of
mathematical theory of quantum physics, this semi-group is called the heat
semi-group generated by H. In this case, H is called the generator of
it. This nomenclature may come from (1.36), which is called the abstract
heat equation in the complex variable.16
15In general, a family {T(t)}t≥0 of bounded linear operators on a Banach space is called a
C0-semi-group or a strongly continuous one-parameter semi-group if the follow-
ing three conditions are satisﬁed: (i) (semi-group property) T(t+s) = T(t)T(s), t, s ≥0;
(ii) T(0) = I ; (iii) the mapping:t 7→T(t) is strongly continuous. For the theory of C0-
semi-groups, see, e.g., [Yosida (1965), Chapter IX]; [Reed and Simon (1975), §X.8]; [Lax
(2002), Chapter 34].
16An original heat equation in the context of physical heat theory is given in the case
where H = −γ∆with γ > 0 a constant, ∆is the three dimensional Laplacian and,
for each β > 0, Ψ(β) is a function on R3 = {x = (x1, x2, x3)|xj ∈R, j = 1, 2, 3}:
∂Ψ(β, x)/∂β = γ∆Ψ(β, x), where Ψ(β, x) := [Ψ(β)](x) (the value of the function Ψ(β)
at x ∈R3).

Analytic Vectors
Let A be a linear operator on a Hilbert space H and C∞(A) be the C∞-
domain of A (see (1.26)). A C∞-vector Ψ ∈C∞(A) is called an analytic
vector for A if there exists a number t > 0 such that

(1.39)
If (1.39) holds for all t > 0, then Ψ is said to be entire analytic. We
denote by E (A) the set of entire analytic vectors for A.

There is a relation between analytic vectors of a symmetric operator
and essential self-adjointness of it.
Theorem 1.27 (analytic vector theorem). Let A be a symmetric op-
erator on H . Suppose that there exists a subspace D ⊂D(A) such that D
includes a dense subset of analytic vectors of A and AD ⊂D. Then A is
essentially self-adjoint on D.
For a proof of this theorem, see, e.g., [Arai (2006b), §2.7] or [Reed and
Simon (1975), p.203, Corollary 2].

Analysis of Strongly Commuting Self-adjoint Operators
1.8.1
Strong commutativity
Let S and T be linear operators on a Hilbert space H . In the case where
S or T is unbounded, the usual notion of commutativity is not so useful,
because D([S, T ]) may be very small even if S and T are densely deﬁned.
But, if S and T are self-adjoint, then one can deﬁne another notion of
commutativity of them:
Deﬁnition 1.1. (i) Two self-adjoint operators S and T on a Hilbert space
H are said to strongly commute if the spectral measures ES and ET
commute, i.e., for all Borel sets B, C ∈B1, [ES(B), ET (C)] = 0.
(ii) An N-tuple (T1, . . . , TN) of self-adjoint operators T1, . . . , TN on H
is said to be strongly commuting if, every pair (i, j) with i ̸= j (i, j =
1, . . . , N), Ti and Tj strongly commute.

Proposition 1.35. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H . Then the
following (i)–(iii) are equivalent:
(i) S and T strongly commute.
(ii) For all B ∈B1, ES(B)T ⊂T ES(B).
(iii) For all z ∈ρ(T ) and B ∈B1, [(T −z)−1, ES(B)] = 0.
Proof. (i) =⇒(ii). Assume (i). Then, for all Ψ ∈H and B, C ∈B1,
∥ET (C)ES(B)Ψ∥= ∥ES(B)ET (C)Ψ∥≤∥ET (C)Ψ∥. Hence, for all Ψ ∈
D(T ),
Z
R
λ2d∥ET (λ)ES(B)Ψ∥2 ≤
Z
R
λ2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence ES(B)Ψ ∈D(T ). Thus D(ES(B)T ) ⊂D(T ES(B)). Moreover, for
all Φ ∈H ,
⟨Φ, ES(B)T Ψ⟩=

R
λd ⟨ES(B)Φ, ET (λ)Ψ⟩

Z
R
λd ⟨Φ, ET (λ)ES(B)Ψ⟩

Hence ES(B)T Ψ = T ES(B)Ψ. Thus (ii) holds.
(ii) =⇒(iii). Assume (ii). Then, for all z ∈C, ES(B)(T −z) ⊂(T −
z)ES(B) . Hence, by Proposition 1.1, for all z ∈ρ(T ), (T −z)−1ES(B) ⊂
ES(B)(T −z)−1. Hence (iii) holds.
(iii) =⇒(i). Assume (iii). Using Stone’s formula

(a, b ∈R, a < b),
(1.41)
one can show that, for all ﬁnite intervals J and B ∈B1, ET (J)ES(B) =
ES(B)ET (J). Then, ﬁxing Ψ, Φ ∈H , B ∈B1 arbitrarily and applying
E. Hopf’s extension theorem to the complex-valued measures µ1(C) :=
⟨Φ, ET (C)ES(B)Ψ⟩and µ2(C) := ⟨Φ, ES(B)ET (C)Ψ⟩, C ∈B1, one
sees that µ1(C) = µ2(C), C ∈B1.
Hence one obtains ET (C)ES(B) =
ES(B)ET (C), B, C ∈B1. Thus S and T strongly commute.
Proposition 1.36. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H . Then the
following (i)–(iv) are equivalent:
(i) S and T strongly commute.
 

50
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) For all s ∈R, eisST = T eisS.
(iii) For all s, t ∈R, [eisS, eitT ] = 0.
(iv) For all z ∈ρ(T ) and w ∈ρ(S), [(T −z)−1, (S −w)−1] = 0.
Proof. (i) =⇒(ii). Assume (i). Then Proposition 1.35(ii) holds. This
implies that, for all s ∈R, eisST ⊂T eisS. Hence eisST e−isS ⊂T . Since
the both sides are self-adjoint, it follows that eisST e−isS = T . Hence (ii)
holds.
(ii) =⇒(iii). Assume (ii). Then eisST e−isS = T for all s ∈R. By
applying Theorem 1.24 with U = eisS and f(λ) = eitλ, λ ∈R, we obtain
eisSeitT e−isS = eitT . Hence (iii) holds.
(iii) =⇒(iv). Assume (iii). By Theorem 1.11, each z ∈C\ R is in ρ(T ).
Moreover, it is not so diﬃcult to show that the following formula holds:
(T −z)−1 =
(
−i R ∞
0
e−itzeitT dt if Im z < 0
i
R 0
−∞e−itzeitT dt if Im z > 0 ,
where the integral is taken in the strong sense.
It follows that, for all
z, w ∈C \ R, (T −z)−1(S −w)−1 = (S −w)−1(T −z)−1 · · · (∗). By the
continuity of the function ρ(T ) ∋z 7→(T −z)−1 ∈B(H ) , one can extend
(∗) for all z ∈ρ(T ) and w ∈ρ(S).
(iv) =⇒(i). This can proved by using Stone’s formula (1.41).
Theorem 1.28. Let S and T be strongly commuting self-adjoint operators
on H . Then, for all m, n ∈N, Sm and T n strongly commute.
Proof. Let fm(λ) = λm, λ ∈R. Then, by Theorem 1.19, for all B, C ∈
B1, ESm(B) = ES(f −1
m (B)) and ET n(C) = ET (f −1
n (C)). Hence ESm(B)
commutes with ET n(C). Thus Sm and T n strongly commute.
The next proposition tells us that, the notion of strong commutativity
of self-adjoint operators is indeed stronger than that of commutativity:
Proposition 1.37. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H .
(i) If S and T strongly commute, then S and T commute.
(ii) Let S, T ∈B(H ). Then S and T strongly commute if and only if they
commute.
Proof. (i) Proposition 1.36(iv) is equivalent to [(S −w)(T −z)]−1 = [(T −
z)(S −w)]−1 for all z ∈ρ(T ) and w ∈ρ(S). Hence (S −w)(T −z) =
(T −z)(S −w). This implies that D(ST ) ∩D(S) ⊂D((S −w)(T −z)) =
 

Theory of Linear Operators
51
D((T −z)(S −w)) and, for all Ψ ∈D(ST ) ∩D(S), Ψ ∈D(T S) and
T SΨ = ST Ψ. In particular, for all Ψ ∈D(T S) ∩D(ST ), [S, T ]Ψ = 0.
(ii) We need only to show that the commutativity of S and T implies
the strong commutativity of S and T . Let ST = T S. Then it is easy to see
that (T −z)(S −w) = (S −w)(T −z) for all z, w ∈C. Hence Proposition
1.36(iv) holds. Thus S and T strongly commute.
Remark 1.5. In the case where at least one of S and T is unbounded, the
commutativity of S and T does not imply the strong commutativity of S
and T . One should be careful about this point.
The following proposition also is useful:
Proposition 1.38. Let T ∈B(H ) and S be a self-adjoint operator on H .
Then T S ⊂ST if and only if T eitS = eitST, t ∈R.
Proof. Suppose that T S ⊂ST . Then it is easy to see that, for all n ∈N,
T Sn ⊂SnT . Let RN(t) := PN
n=0(itS)n/n!, t ∈R, N ∈N. Then, for all
Ψ ∈C∞
0 (S), T RN(t)Ψ = RN(t)T Ψ. We have limN→∞RN(t)Ψ = eitSΨ.
Hence T eitSΨ = limN→∞RN(t)T Ψ.
It is not so diﬃcult to show that,
if limN→∞RN(t)Φ (Φ ∈C∞(S)) exists, then it is equal to eitSΦ. Hence
T eitSΨ = eitST Ψ. Since C∞
0 (S) is dense and eitST and T eitS are bounded,
the operator equality eitST = T eitS follows.
Conversely, suppose that T eitS = eitST . Let Ψ ∈D(T S) = D(S). Then
T eitSΨ = eitST Ψ, t ∈R · · · (∗). The vector-valued function: t 7→eitSΨ is
strongly diﬀerentiable with strong derivative (eitSΨ)′ = iSeitSΨ.
Since
T is bounded, it follows that T eitSΨ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t with
(T eitSΨ)′ = iT SeitSΨ. Hence, by (∗), eitST Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in
t. Therefore, by Theorem 1.21(iv), T Ψ ∈D(S) (i.e., Ψ ∈D(ST )) and
(eitST Ψ)′ = iSeitST Ψ. Hence iT SeitSΨ = iSeitST Ψ. Taking t = 0, we
obtain T SΨ = ST Ψ.

Joint spectral measure and joint spectrum
We now consider an N-tuple T = (T1, . . . , TN) of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H .
Theorem 1.29. There exists a unique N-dimensional spectral measure ET
such that
ET (B1 × · · · × BN) = ET1(B1) · · · ETN (BN),
Bj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , N.

Moreover,
Tj =
Z
RN λjdET (λ),
j = 1, . . . , N,
where λ = (λ1, . . . , λN) ∈RN.
The N-dimensional spectral measure ET in Theorem 1.29 and its
support
σJ(T ) := supp ET
are respectively called the joint spectral measure and the joint spec-
trum of T .
A physical interpretation of the joint spectral measure ET and the
joint spectrum σJ(T ) in the context of quantum mechanics is as fol-
lows.
Suppose that each Tj represents a physical quantity (an observ-
able) in a quantum system. Then the strong commutativity of T means
that compatible measurements of T1, . . . , TN are possible.
If the quan-
tum system is in a state represented by a unit vector Ψ ∈H (∥Ψ∥=
1), then the probability that the result of a compatible measurement
of T lies in a Borel set B ⊂RN is ∥ET (B)Ψ∥2.
The closure of the
set {λ ∈RN|λ is a result by a compatible measurement of T } is equal to
σJ(T ). But one should keep in mind that σJ(T ) is not necessarily the di-
rect product σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) (see Theorem 1.30 below and an example
in the next subsection).
Theorem 1.30.
σJ(T ) ⊂σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN).
(1.42)
Proof. We have
ET (σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN)) = ET1(σ(T1)) · · · ETN (σ(TN)) = I · · · I = I.
Hence (1.42) holds.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the equality in (1.42) to hold is
given in the next theorem:
Theorem 1.31. One has
σJ(T ) = σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN)
(1.43)
if and only if, for each λ ∈σ(T1) × · · ·× σ(TN) and every ε > 0, ET1((λ1 −
ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0.
 

Theory of Linear Operators
53
Proof. Suppose that (1.43) holds. Then each λ ∈σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN)
is in σJ(T ) = supp ET .
Hence, by Proposition 1.24, for all ε > 0,
ET (Bε(λ)) ̸= 0. One has Bε(λ) ⊂(λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε) × · · · × (λN −ε, λN + ε).
Hence ET (Bε(λ)) ≤ET1((λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)). Hence
ET1((λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0.
Conversely, suppose that, for each λ ∈σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) and every
ε > 0, ET1((λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0. Then ET ((λ1 −
ε, λ1 + ε) × · · · × (λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0. One has
(λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε) × · · · × (λN −ε, λN + ε) ⊂B√
Nε(λ).
Hence ET (B√
Nε(λ)) ̸= 0. Therefore, by Proposition 1.24, λ ∈supp ET =
σJ(T ). Hence σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) ⊂σJ(T ). Thus (1.43) follows.
1.8.3
An example in quantum mechanics: a free relativistic
quantum particle
We consider a system of a free relativistic quantum particle with mass
m ≥0 in the (d + 1)-dimensional space-time, where d ∈N is the dimension
of the space part.17 To be deﬁnite, we denote the d-dimensional space Rd
as the position space for a particle by
Rd
x := {x = (x1, . . . , xd)|xj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d},
where an element x in Rd
x represents a position (a point) in the space Rd.
The momentum space of a particle in Rd
x is denoted by
Rd
p := {p = (p1, . . . , pd)|pj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d},
where an element p in Rd
p physically represents a momentum of the particle.
But, if there would be no danger of confusions, then we may write simply
Rd dropping the subscript # in Rd
# (# = x or p).
The energy of a free relativistic particle with mass m and momentum
p ∈Rd
p is given by
Em(p) :=
p
p2c2 + m2c4,
(1.44)
where c is a parameter denoting the speed of light in the vacuum and
p2 := Pd
j=1(pj)2.
As is well known, one can take L2(Rd
x) as a Hilbert space of state vec-
tors of the quantum system consisting of a (not necessarily relativistic)
17Here one does not need any detailed knowledge on relativistic quantum mechanics. A
review on the special theory of relativity will be given in Section 8.8.

quantum particle in Rd
x. This choice of Hilbert space is called the coordi-
nate representation or the q-representation. One of the other choices
of Hilbert space is given by L2(Rd
p). This is called the momentum rep-
resentation. They are naturally isomorphic under the Fourier transform
Fd,ℏ: L2(Rd
x) →L2(Rd
p) deﬁned by
(Fd,ℏf)(p) :=
1
(2πℏ)d/2
Z
Rd e−ip·x/ℏf(x)dx,
f ∈L2(Rd
x),
(1.45)
where
p · x :=
d
X
j=1
pjxj
is the Euclidean inner product of p and x and the integral on the right hand
side is taken in the sense of L2-convergence. Recall that Fd,ℏis unitary. If
f ∈L2(Rd
x) is integrable, then the right hand side of (1.45) has meaning
itself as a Lebesgue integral.
We denote by C∞
0 (Rd
x) the set of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions on Rd
x
with compact support.18 For each j = 1, . . . , d, we deﬁne a linear operator
∂j on L2(Rd
x) as follows:
D(∂j) := C∞
0 (Rd
x),
∂jf := ∂f
∂xj ,
f ∈D(∂j).
We call ∂j the partial diﬀerential operator in the variable xj. It is
shown that ∂j is closable. Hence one can deﬁne
Dj := ∂j,
the closure of ∂j, which is called the generalized partial diﬀerential
operator in the variable xj.
The following theorem holds19:
Theorem 1.32. For each j = 1, . . . , d, the operator
ˆpj := iℏDj
(1.46)
is self-adjoint and C∞
0 (Rd
x) is a core of ˆpj.
Moreover, for all a =
(a1, . . . , ad) ∈Rd
x and f ∈L2(Rd
x),
(eia1 ˆp1/ℏeia2 ˆp2/ℏ· · · eiad ˆpd/ℏf)(x) = f(x −a),
a.e.x ∈Rd
x.
In particular, (ˆp1, . . . , ˆpd) is strongly commuting.
18Recall that the support of a function f on Rd, denoted by supp f, is deﬁned by
supp f := {x ∈Rd|f(x) ̸= 0}. A subset C ⊂Rd is compact if and only if C is a bounded
closed set.
19For a proof, see, e.g., [Arai (1997a), Theorem 4.7]. See also Example 8.6.

The operator ˆpj is called the jth momentum operator of a quantum
particle. We remark that, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics,
ˆpj := −ˆpj = −iℏDj
(1.47)
is called the jth momentum operator.
The operator
∆:=
d
X
j=1
D2
j,
called the generalized d-dimensional Laplacian, is a non-positive self-
adjoint operator on L2(Rd
x).20
Hence −ℏ2c2∆+ m2c4 is a non-negative
self-adjoint operator on L2(Rd
x). Therefore, by functional calculus, one can
deﬁne a non-negative self-adjoint operator
ˆp0 := (−ℏ2c2∆+ m2c4)1/2.
This operator is called the free relativistic Schr¨odinger operator on
L2(Rd
x). It may be physically interpreted as an operator representing the
Hamiltonian of a free relativistic quantum particle with mass m, but with-
out spin (angular momentum with respect to an internal degree of freedom).
In view of the notation in relativistic theory (see Section 8.8 for a review
of relativistic theory), for each p = (p1, . . . , pd) ∈Rd
p, we deﬁne a d-tuple
(p1, . . . , pd) ∈Rd by
pj := −pj,
j = 1, . . . , d.
By Fourier analysis, we have the following operator equalities:
Fd,ℏˆp0F −1
d,ℏ= MEm,
Fd,ℏˆpjF −1
d,ℏ= Mpj,
j = 1, . . . , d,
where MEm and Mpj are the multiplication operators by Em and the func-
tion p 7→pj ∈R respectively. It follows from the unitary invariance of
spectra of a linear operator, Theorem 1.15 and Corollary 1.2 that
σ(ˆp0) = {Em(p)|p ∈Rd} = [mc2, ∞),
σ(ˆpj) = {pj|p ∈Rd} = R.
Hence
σ(ˆp0) × σ(ˆp1) × · · · × σ(ˆpd) = [mc2, ∞) × Rd.
(1.48)
20For a proof, see, e.g., [Arai (1997a), Chapter 5].

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The quantity mc2 is called the rest energy of a relativistic particle of mass
m.
Let Eˆpµ be the spectral measure of ˆpµ. Then it follows from Theorem
1.20 that
Fd,ℏEˆp0(B)F −1
d,ℏ= MχE−1
m (B),
(1.49)
Fd,ℏEˆpj(B)F −1
d,ℏ= Mχ{p∈Rd|pj ∈B},
B ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , d. (1.50)
Hence Eˆpµ and Eˆpν commute for all µ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d. Therefore
ˆp := (ˆp0, ˆp1, . . . , ˆpd)
is strongly commuting. Using the joint spectral measure Eˆp of ˆp, we have
ˆpµ =
Z
R1+d pµdEˆp(p),
where p = (p0, p1, . . . , pd) ∈R1+d. The (1+d)-tuple ˆp is called the energy-
momentum operator of a free relativistic quantum particle with mass m.
By Theorem 1.30 and (1.48), the joint spectrum σJ(ˆp) of ˆp satisﬁes
σJ(ˆp) ⊂σ(ˆp0) × σ(ˆpj) × · · · × σ(ˆpd) = [mc2, ∞) × Rd.
(1.51)
But
σJ(ˆp) ̸= [mc2, ∞) × Rd.
This follows from Theorem 1.31 and the fact that, for δ > 0, ε > 0 and
λ0 >
√
dcδ + ε + mc2 (hence (λ0, 0) ∈[mc2, ∞) × Rd),
Eˆp0((λ0 −ε, λ0 + ε))Eˆp1((−δ, δ)) · · · Eˆpd((−δ, δ)) = 0,
which can be shown by using (1.49) and (1.50).
In fact, we can identify σJ(ˆp) exactly as follows. Let
Vm := {p ∈R1+d|p0 = Em(p)},
(1.52)
which is called the hyperbolic hypersurface with mass m (Fig. 1.6).
Theorem 1.33.
σJ(ˆp) = Vm.
(1.53)
Proof. It is obvious that Vm is a closed subset of R1+d.

This means that, for a.e. p ∈R1+d with respect to the measure ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2,
p2
0 = Em(p)2. Hence supp ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2 ⊂{p ∈R1+d|p2
0 = Em(p)2}. Note
that
supp ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2 ⊂σJ(ˆp) ⊂[mc2, ∞) × Rd.
Hence supp ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2 ⊂Vm. In particular,
Eˆp(V c
m)f = 0.
Since ∩d
µ=0D(ˆp2
µ) is dense and Eˆp(V c
m) is bounded, it follows that Eˆp(V c
m) =
0. Hence σJ(ˆp) ⊂Vm.
To prove the converse inclusion relation, we apply Proposition 1.24. Let
a = (a0, a) ∈Vm be ﬁxed and ε > 0 be arbitrary. For each n >

d + 1, we
deﬁne a closed interval in R1+d:
J :=

We have J ⊂Bε(a). Hence
Eˆp(Bε(a)) ≥Eˆp0(J0)Eˆp1(J1) · · · Eˆpd(Jd),
where Jµ := [aµ −ε
n, aµ + ε
n]. Therefore, for all f ∈L2(Rd),
∥Eˆp(Bε(a))f∥2 ≥Iε(f)
with
Iε(f) :=
Z
{p∈Rd||Em(p)−Em(a)|≤ε/n,|pj−aj|≤ε/n,j=1,...,d}
|(Fd,ℏf)(p)|2dp.
 

58
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By the continuity of Em, there exists a constant δ > 0 such that, if |p−a| <
δ, then |Em(p) −Em(a)| < ε/n. Therefore, putting r := min{δ, ε/n},
Iε(f) ≥
Z
Br(a)
|(Fd,ℏf)(p)|2dp.
Hence, taking f = F −1
d,ℏχBr(a) ∈L2(Rd), we have Iε(f) ≥|Br(a)| > 0,
where |B| with B ∈Bd denotes the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure of B.
Therefore Eˆp(Bε(a)) ̸= 0. Hence, by Proposition 1.24, a ∈σJ(Eˆp). Thus
Vm ⊂σJ(Eˆp).
In the special relativity theory, Vm represents the set of energy-
momentum vectors of a relativistic particle with mass m.
Hence (1.53)
shows a harmonious relation in the classical-quantum correspondence.
1.8.4
Functional
calculus
of
strongly
commuting
self-
adjoint operators
Let T = (T1, . . . , TN) be an N-tuple of mutually strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H . Then one can develop the functional calculus for
the joint spectral measure ET as in Subsection 1.5.4 with d and E replaced
by N and ET respectively. Hence, for each Borel measurable function f on
RN, one can deﬁne a linear operator f(T ) on H by
f(T ) :=
Z
RN f(λ)dET (λ).
In the notation in Subsection 1.5.4, f(T ) is the operator TE(f) in the case
where d = N and E = ET . One can easily translate the statements in
Theorem 1.16 to those in terms of f(T ). But we omit writing them down
here.
Let f be a (not necessarily real-valued) continuous function on RN.
Then, by Theorem 1.16(iii), f(T ) is a densely deﬁned closed operator. In
particular, if f is real-valued, then f(T ) is self-adjoint (Theorem 1.16(vi)).
It may be useful if one can ﬁnd suitable cores of f(T ). For this purpose,
we introduce a subset:
D0(T ) :=



N
Y
j=1
ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψ|Ψ ∈H , Rj > 0, j = 1, . . . , N


. (1.54)
It is easy to see that D0(T ) is a subspace. Moreover, D0(T ) is dense in H ,
because, for all Ψ ∈H ,
lim
R→∞ET1([−R, R]) · · · ETN ([−R, R])Ψ = Ψ.
Lemma 1.7. Let f : RN →C be continuous. Then D0(T ) ⊂D(f(T )).

Proof. Let Φ = QN

Hence Φ ∈D(f(T )).
Theorem 1.34. Let f be a continuous function on RN. Then:
(i) σ(f(T )) = {f(λ)|λ ∈σJ(T )}.
(ii) The subspace D0(T ) is a core for f(T ).
(iii) If f is real-valued, then f(T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D0(T ).
Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 1.16(x).
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(f(T )) so that
R
RN |f(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞. For each
n ∈N, we take Ψn := ET1([−n, n]) · · · ETN ([−n, n])Ψ. Then, Ψn ∈D0(T )
and Ψn →Ψ as n →∞. Moreover, by functional calculus,
∥f(T)Ψn −f(T )Ψ∥2 = −
Z
[−n,n]N |f(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2

Z
RN |f(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2.
Applying the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, one sees that the
right hand side converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence f(T)Ψn →f(T )Ψ as
n →∞. Thus D0(T ) is a core of f(T ).
(iii) This follows from (ii) and Proposition 1.21.
We now specialize the function f to a real polynomial

It is easy to see that LP (T ) is a symmetric operator with D(LP (T )) ⊃
D0(T ) and
LP (T ) ⊂P(T ).
(1.56)
Theorem 1.35. The operator LP (T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D0(T )
and
LP (T ) = P(T ).
(1.57)
Moreover,
σ(LP (T )) = {P(λ)|λ ∈σJ(T )}.
(1.58)
Proof. By Theorem 1.34(iii), P(T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D0(T ).
By (1.56), P(T ) ↾D0(T ) = LP (T ) ↾D0(T ). Hence LP(T ) is essentially
self-adjoint on D0(T ) and (1.57) follows.
By (1.57), σ(LP (T )) = σ(P(T )). By this relation and Theorem 1.34(i),
we obtain (1.58).
We next consider conditions under which LP (T ) itself is self-adjoint.
Theorem 1.36. Suppose that, for all k = (k1, . . . , kN) ∈KP and j =

sup

(1.59)
Then LP (T ) is self-adjoint and LP (T ) = P(T ).

⊂
D(LP (T )). Let Ψ ∈D(P(T )). Then
Z
RN |P(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞.

k ∈KP,

N |2 ≤C(|P(λ)|2 + 1),
λ ∈σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN).
By Theorem 1.30, we have

This implies that Ψ ∈∩k∈KP D(T k1

N ). Hence Ψ ∈D(LP (T )).
The next theorem is concerned with a class of cores of LP (T ).
Theorem 1.37. Suppose that there exists a dense subspace D in H such
that D ⊂D(LP (T )) and, for j = 1, . . . , N and all R > 0, ETj([−R, R])D ⊂
D. Then LP (T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D and (1.57) holds.
Proof. Let Φ ∈D0(T ). Then there exist constants Rj > 0 (j = 1, . . . , N)
and a vector Ψ ∈H such that Φ = QN
j=1 ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψ. Since D is
dense, there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D such that Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). Let
Φn := QN
j=1 ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψn. Then, by the present assumption, Φn ∈D
(∀n ∈N) . It is easy to see that Φn →Φ and LP (T )Φn →LP(T )Φ (n →
∞). Hence LP (T ) ↾D0(T ) ⊂LP (T ) ↾D. By this result and Theorem
1.35, we see that LP (T ) ↾D is self-adjoint and equal to P(T ).
We apply Theorems 1.35 and 1.36 to special cases.
Corollary 1.6. Let T = (T1, . . . , TN) be a set of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H . Then:
(i) S := PN

and S ≥PN
j=1 γj.
(iii) For all t ∈R and σ ∈SN,
eitS = eitTσ(1) · · · eitTσ(N).
(1.62)
Proof. (i) We consider the case where P(λ) = PN
j=1 λj, λ ∈RN. Then
LP (T ) = S. Hence, by Theorem 1.35, S is essentially self-adjoint and (1.61)
holds.

Proof. (i) We consider the case where P(λ) = QN
j=1 λj. Then LP (T ) = R.
Hence, by Theorem 1.35, R is essentially self-adjoint and (1.63) holds.
(ii) By the assumption, the constant δ := min{γj|j = 1, . . . , N} is
positive. We have σ(Tj) ⊂[δ, ∞). Hence, for all j = 1, . . . , N

Reduction of Linear Operators
Let X be a Hilbert space and M be a closed subspace of X . We denote
by PM the orthogonal projection onto M . By the projection theorem, X
has the orthogonal decomposition
X = M ⊕M ⊥,
(1.64)
where we use the natural identiﬁcation of a vector Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2 (Ψ1 =
PM Ψ, Ψ2 = PM ⊥Ψ) with (Ψ1, Ψ2) ∈M ⊕M ⊥.
A linear operator A on X is said to be reduced by M if PM A ⊂APM,
i.e., for all Ψ ∈D(A), PMΨ ∈D(A) and APM Ψ = PMAΨ. In this case,
A is reduced by the orthogonal complement M ⊥of M too, since I −PM
is the orthogonal projection onto M ⊥and (I −PM )A ⊂A(I −PM ).
Let A be reduced by M . Then one can deﬁne a linear operator AM on
M as follows:
D(AM ) := D(A) ∩M ,
AMΨ := AΨ,
Ψ ∈D(AM ).
The operator AM is called the reduced part of A to M .
Proposition 1.39. Let A be reduced by M . Then:
(i) The operator A has the direct sum decomposition
A = AM ⊕AM ⊥
(1.65)
relative to the orthogonal decomposition (1.64).
(ii) σ(A) = σ(AM ) ∪σ(AM ⊥).
(iii) ρ(A) = ρ(AM ) ∩ρ(AM ⊥). Moreover, for all z ∈ρ(A), (A −z)−1 is
reduced by M and ((A −z)−1)M = (AM −z)−1.
(iv) Let B be a linear operator on X and reduced by M . Suppose that
A ⊂B. Then AM ⊂BM .
Proof. (i) By the projection theorem, each Ψ ∈D(A) has the orthogonal
decomposition Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2 with Ψ1 := PM Ψ and Ψ2 := PM ⊥Ψ. By the
reducibility of A by M and M ⊥, we have Ψ1 ∈D(A)∩M , Ψ2 ∈D(A)∩M ⊥
and AΨ1 = AMΨ1, AΨ2 = AM ⊥Ψ2. Hence AΨ = AM Ψ1 + AM ⊥Ψ2,
implying A ⊂AM ⊕AM ⊥. It is easy to see that AM ⊕AM ⊥⊂A. Hence
(1.65) holds.
(ii) This is a simple application of Theorem 1.12(ii).
(iii) The ﬁrst half follows from (ii). Let z ∈ρ(A). Then, using the
equality
A −z = (AM −z) ⊕(AM ⊥−z),
(1.66)
 

64
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
one has
(A −z)−1 = (AM −z)−1 ⊕(AM ⊥−z)−1.
(1.67)
Thus (A −z)−1 is reduced by M and ((A −z)−1)M = (AM −z)−1.
(iv) An easy exercise.
Remark 1.6. If A is reduced by M , then A leaves M and M ⊥invari-
ant in the sense that A(D(A) ∩M ) ⊂M · · · (∗) and A(D(A) ∩M ⊥) ⊂
M ⊥· · · (∗∗). But, in the case where A is unbounded, (∗) and (∗∗) do not
necessarily imply the reducibility of A by M . In treating unbounded opera-
tors, one should be careful about this point (for the case of bounded linear
operators, see the next proposition).
Proposition 1.40. Let A ∈B(X ). Then a necessary and suﬃcient con-
dition for A to be reduced by M is that AM ⊂M and AM ⊥⊂M ⊥.
Proof. The necessity of the condition follows from the deﬁnition of re-
ducibility.
To prove the suﬃciency of the condition, suppose that AM ⊂M and
AM ⊥⊂M ⊥. Then, for all Ψ ∈X , the identity AΨ = APM Ψ + APM ⊥Ψ
gives the orthogonal decomposition of the vector AΨ relative to the orthog-
onal decomposition (1.64). Hence PM AΨ = APM Ψ, PM ⊥AΨ = APM ⊥Ψ.
Thus A is reduced by M .
Proposition 1.41. Let A and B be linear operators on X which are re-
duced by a closed subspace M ⊂X . Then: A + B is reduced by M and
(A + B)M = AM + BM.
Proof. An easy exercise.
Proposition 1.42. Let A be a linear operator on X which is reduced by
a closed subspace M ⊂X . Let Y be a Hilbert space and U : X →Y
be a unitary transformation. Let N := UM . Then UM := U ↾M is a
unitary transformation from M to N and UAU −1 is reduced by N with
(UAU −1)N = UMAM U −1
M .
Proof. Let P := PM and Q := PN . By the present assumption, PA ⊂
AP.
It is obvious that UP = QU.
Hence U −1Q = PU −1.
Therefore
(UAU −1)Q = UAPU −1 ⊃UPAU −1 = Q(UAU −1).
Hence UAU −1 is
reduced by N . It is easy to see that (UAU −1)N = UMAMU −1
M .
 

Theory of Linear Operators
65
The next theorem summarizes main properties of the reduced part of a
linear operator A to a closed subspace.
Theorem 1.38. Let A be a linear operator on X reduced by a closed sub-
space M .
(i) If D(A) is dense in X , then D(AM ) is dense in M .
(ii) If A is injective, then so is AM.
(iii) If A is surjective, then so is AM.
(iv) Suppose that A is closed. Then AM is closed. Moreover, for any core
D of A, PM D is a core of AM .
(v) Suppose that A is closable. Then AM is closable. Moreover, ¯A is
reduced by M and ( ¯A)M = AM.
(vi) If A is bounded (D(A) is not necessarily equal to X ), then AM is
bounded with ∥AM∥≤∥A∥.
(vii) If A is symmetric, then so is AM.
(viii) If A is an orthogonal projection, then so is AM.
(ix) Let A be self-adjoint. Then AM is self-adjoint. Moreover, for each
Borel set J ∈B1, EA(J) (EA is the spectral measure of A) is reduced
by M —in this case, EA is said to be reduced by M — and the reduced
part EA(J)M is equal to EAM (J).
(x) If A is unitary, then so is AM.
(xi) If A is a contraction operator, then so is AM.
(xii) Let A be self-adjoint and B be a self-adjoint operator on X which
is reduced by M and strongly commutes with A. Then AM and BM
strongly commute.
Proof. (i) Let Φ ∈D(AM )⊥∩M . Each Ψ ∈D(A) is written as Ψ =
Ψ1 + Ψ2 with Ψ1 ∈D(AM ) and Ψ2 ∈D(A⊥
M ). Hence ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩= 0. Since
D(A) is dense in X , it follows that Φ = 0. Thus D(AM ) is dense in M .
(ii) For all Ψ ∈ker AM , AΨ = AM Ψ = 0. Hence, under the present
assumption, Ψ = 0. Thus AM is injective.
(iii) For each Ψ ∈M , there exists a vector Φ ∈D(A) such that AΦ = Ψ.
Hence PM AΦ = Ψ. The left hand side is equal to APM Φ = AM PMΦ.
Hence AM is surjective.
(iv) Let Ψn ∈D(AM), Ψn →Ψ ∈M , AMΨn →Φ ∈M (n →∞).
Then Ψn ∈D(A) and AΨn →Φ (n →∞).
By the closedness of A,
Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ = Φ. Hence Ψ ∈M ∩D(A) = D(AM) and AMΨ = Φ.
Thus AM is closed.
Let Ψ ∈D(AM ).
Then Ψ ∈D(A).
Hence there exists a sequence
 

66
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
{Ψn}∞
n=1 ⊂D such that Ψn →Ψ, AΨn →AΨ (n →∞). Hence, letting
Φn = PM Ψn, we see that Φn ∈PM D, Φn →PM Ψ = Ψ (n →∞) and
PM AΨn →PMAΨ (n →∞). On the other hand, PMAΨn = APM Ψn =
AΦn and PMAΨ = APM Ψ = AM Ψ. Hence AM Φn →AM Ψ (n →∞).
Thus PMD is a core of AM.
(v) Let Ψn ∈D(AM), Ψn →0 and AMΨn →Φ ∈M (n →∞). Then
AΨn →Φ (n →∞). Since A is closable, it follows that Φ = 0. Hence AM
is closable. By the assumption, PMA ⊂APM , from which it follows that
PM A ⊂APM . Hence A is reduced by M . It is obvious that AM ⊂AM.
For each Ψ ∈D(AM), there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(AM ) such
that Ψn →Ψ and AM Ψn →AMΨ (n →∞). Hence Ψ ∈D(AM) and
AM Ψ = AMΨ. Hence D(AM ) ⊂D(AM ). Thus we obtain AM = AM.
(vi) In this case, for all Ψ ∈D(AM ), ∥AMΨ∥= ∥AΨ∥≤∥A∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence AM is bounded with ∥AM∥≤∥A∥.
(vii) This follows from (i) and that, for all Ψ ∈D(AM ), ⟨Ψ, AMΨ⟩=
⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩∈R.
(viii) In the present case, AM ∈B(M ). Hence, by (vii), AM is self-
adjoint. Moreover, for all Ψ ∈M , A2
MΨ = A2Ψ = AΨ = AMΨ. Hence
A2
M = AM . Thus AM is an orthogonal projection.
(ix) By (vii), AM is symmetric. By (1.66), we have
A ± i = (AM ± i) ⊕(AM ⊥± i).
Since A is self-adjoint, Ran(A ± i) = H . Hence Ran(AM ± i) = M . Thus
AM is self-adjoint.
By Proposition 1.39(iii) and Stone’s formula (1.41) with T = A, we
see that PMEA(J)PM is equal to EAM (J). On the other hand, by (viii),
PM EA(J)PM is equal to EA(J)M. Hence EAM (J) = EA(J)M.
(x) By (iii), AM is surjective. The norm preserving property of AM
follows from that of A.
(xi) This follows from (vi).
(xii) By the present assumption, for all J, K ∈B1, EA(J) and EB(K)
commute. Hence PMEA(J)PM and PMEB(K)PM commute. By this fact
and (ix), EAM (J) and EBM (K) commute.
Theorem 1.39. Let A and B be linear operators on H reduced by M .
Then AB is reduced by M and
(AB)M = AMBM.
(1.68)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(AB). Then Ψ ∈D(B) and BΨ ∈D(A). The former
implies that PM Ψ ∈D(B) and BPMΨ = PM BΨ, The latter implies that
 

Theory of Linear Operators
67
PM BΨ ∈D(A) and APMBΨ = PM ABΨ. Hence BPMΨ ∈D(A) and
ABPM Ψ = APM BΨ = PMABΨ. Thus AB is reduced by M . We have
D((AB)M ) = D(AB) ∩M = {Ψ ∈D(B) ∩M |BΨ ∈D(A)}
= {Ψ ∈D(BM )|BMΨ ∈D(A) ∩M }
= {Ψ ∈D(BM )|BMΨ ∈D(AM )}
= D(AM BM).
Thus (1.68) follows.
The following theorem plays an important role in the theory of reduction
of self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 1.40. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on X reduced by a closed
subspace M . Then, for all Borel measurable function f : R →C ∪{±∞},
f(A) is reduced by M and
f(A)M = f(AM).
Proof. Let E be the spectral measure of A and P be the orthogonal pro-
jection onto M . Then f(A) =
R
R f(λ)dE(λ). Let Ψ ∈D(f(A)) so that
R
R |f(λ)|2d∥E(λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞. Since PE(·) = E(·)P by Theorem 1.38(ix), it
follows that PΨ ∈D(f(A)) and, for all Φ ∈H ,
⟨Φ, f(A)PΨ⟩=
Z
R
f(λ)d ⟨Φ, E(λ)PΨ⟩=
Z
R
f(λ)d ⟨PΦ, E(λ)Ψ⟩
= ⟨PΦ, f(A)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, Pf(A)Ψ⟩.
Hence f(A)PΨ = Pf(A)Ψ. Thus f(A) is reduced by M . By Theorem
1.38(ix), the reduced part E(·)M of E(·) to M is the spectral measure of
AM . Using this fact, we see that D(f(A)M) = D(f(AM )) · · · (∗). More-
over, for all Ψ ∈D(f(A)M ) and η ∈M ,
⟨η, f(A)MΨ⟩=
Z
R
f(λ)d ⟨η, E(λ)Ψ⟩=
Z
R
f(λ)d ⟨η, E(λ)M Ψ⟩
= ⟨η, f(AM)Ψ⟩.
Hence f(A)M Ψ = f(AM)Ψ. From this result and (∗), operator equality
f(A)M = f(AM) follows.

Convergence of Self-adjoint Operators
Let Hn (n ∈N) and H be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H .
Then C \ R ⊂ρ(Hn) ∩ρ(H). Hence, for all z ∈C \ R, (Hn −z)−1 and
(H −z)−1 are in B(H ).
Deﬁnition 1.2.
(i) (strong resolvent convergence) The sequence {Hn}n of self-adjoint op-
erators is said to converge to H in the strong resolvent sense if,
for all z ∈C \ R,
s- lim
n→∞(Hn −z)−1 = (H −z)−1,
where s- lim means the strong limit (i.e. limn→∞(Hn −z)−1Ψ = (H −
z)−1Ψ, Ψ ∈H ).
(ii) (norm resolvent convergence) The sequence {Hn}n of self-adjoint op-
erators is said to converge to H in the norm resolvent sense if,
for all z ∈C \ R, limn→∞∥(Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1∥= 0.
A basic criterion on strong resolvent convergence of a sequence of self-
adjoint operators is given in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.41. Suppose that there exists a core D for H such that
D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(Hn) and limn→∞HnΨ = HΨ for all Ψ ∈D. Then {Hn}n
converges to H in the strong resolvent sense.
Proof. Since D is a core for H, for all z ∈C\R, (H−z)D := {(H−z)Ψ|Ψ ∈
D} is dense in H . Let Φ ∈(H −z)D. Then Ψ := (H −z)−1Φ is in D. We
have
(Hn −z)−1Φ −(H −z)−1Φ = (Hn −z)−1(H −Hn)Ψ.
Hence
∥(Hn −z)−1Φ −(H −z)−1Φ∥≤
1
|Im z|∥(H −Hn)Ψ∥.
Hence limn→∞(Hn −z)−1Φ = (H −z)−1Φ. Since supn∈N ∥(Hn −z)−1∥≤
1/|Im z| and (H −z)D is dense, it follows from Proposition A.3 in Appendix
A that s- limn→∞(Hn −z)−1 = (H −z)−1.
We next formulate a suﬃcient condition for {Hn}n to converge to H in
the norm resolvent sense. For this purpose, we ﬁrst prove a lemma, which
is useful.
Lemma 1.8. Let A be a closed operator on H such that D(A) ⊃D(H).
Then, for all z ∈ρ(H), A(H −z)−1 is bounded.
 

Theory of Linear Operators
69
Proof. By the closed graph theorem (Theorem 1.3), it is suﬃcient to show
that A(H −z)−1 is closed, since D(A(H −z)−1) = H . Let {Ψn}n be a
sequence in H such that Ψn →Ψ ∈H and A(H −z)−1Ψn →Φ ∈H as
n →∞. Then (H −z)−1Ψn →(H −z)−1Ψ as n →∞. Since A is closed,
it follows that A(H −z)−1Ψ = Φ. Hence A(H −z)−1 is closed.
Theorem 1.42. Let A be a closed operator on H such that D(A) ⊃D(H).
Suppose that there exists a core D for H such that D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(Hn) and
∥(Hn −H)Ψ∥≤Cn∥AΨ∥,
Ψ ∈D
(1.69)
with a sequence {Cn}n of positive numbers satisfying limn→∞Cn = 0. Then
{Hn}n converges to H in the norm resolvent sense.
Proof. Let z ∈C \ R and Φ ∈(H −z)D. Then
((Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1)Φ = (Hn −z)−1(H −Hn)(H −z)−1Φ.
Hence
∥((Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1)Φ∥≤
1
|Im z|∥(H −Hn)(H −z)−1Φ∥
≤
1
|Im z|Cn∥A(H −z)−1Φ∥(by (1.69))
≤
1
|Im z|Cn∥A(H −z)−1∥∥Φ∥,
where we have used Lemma 1.8. Since (H −z)D is dense, it follows that
∥(Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1∥≤
1
|Im z|Cn∥A(H −z)−1∥→0
as n →∞.
Important implications of strong resolvent convergence and norm resol-
vent convergence are stated in the next theorem.
Theorem 1.43.
(i) If {Hn}n converges to H in the strong resolvent sense, then, for all
bounded continuous functions f on R, s- limn→∞f(Hn) = f(H).
(ii) If {Hn}n converges to H in the norm resolvent sense, then, for
all bounded continuous functions f
on R vanishing at ∞(i.e.
lim|λ|→∞f(λ) = 0), limn→∞∥f(Hn) −f(H)∥= 0.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For a proof of this theorem, see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1980), Theorem
VIII.20].
In applications of Theorem 1.43 to quantum physics, the case f(λ) =
e−izλ (z = t −iβ, t ∈R, β > 0) particularly play important roles:
Corollary 1.8.
(i) If {Hn}n converges to H in the strong resolvent sense, then, for all
t ∈R, s- limn→∞e−itHn = e−itH.
(ii) If {Hn}n converges to H in the strong resolvent sense and there exists
a constant γ ∈R such that Hn, H ≥γ for all n ≥1, then, for all
β > 0, s- limn→∞e−βHn = e−βH.
(iii) If {Hn}n converges to H in the norm resolvent sense and there exists
a constant γ ∈R such that Hn, H ≥γ for all n ≥1, then, for all
β > 0, s- limn→∞∥e−βHn −e−βH∥.
Remark 1.7. In applications, strong and norm resolvent convergences may
be useful also in knowing spectral properties of the limiting operator H from
those of Hn (n ∈N) (see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1980), Theorems VIII.23
and VIII.24]).

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
For a ﬁnite number of Hilbert spaces, a new Hilbert space, called the tensor prod-
uct Hilbert space (or the tensor product) of them, is deﬁned. Some fundamental
properties of tensor product Hilbert spaces are investigated. An important class
of tensor product Hilbert spaces is given by those of L2-spaces. Also discussed is
the tensor product of a Hilbert space and one consisting of Hilbert space-valued
L2-functions. Moreover introduced are symmetric tensor product Hilbert spaces
and anti-symmetric tensor product Hilbert spaces, which play important roles in
quantum theory of many identical quantum particles.

F(ψ1 + ψ2, φ) = F(ψ1, φ) + F(ψ2, φ),

F(αψ, φ) = αF(ψ, φ),
F(ψ, αφ) = αF(ψ, φ).

It follows that, for all n, m ∈N := {1, 2, 3, . . .} (the set of natural numbers)
and ψi ∈V , φj ∈W , αi, βj ∈K (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m)

Example 2.1. Let V be a real inner product space and T : V →V be
a linear operator on V . Then the mapping F : V × V →R deﬁned by
F(ψ, φ) := ⟨ψ, T φ⟩V (ψ, φ ∈V ) is a bilinear form on V .
Example 2.2. Let H be a complex inner product space, J : H →H
be an anti-linear mapping (see Remark 1.1) and T : H →H be a linear
operator. Deﬁne F : H × H →C by F(ψ, φ) := ⟨JΨ, T Φ⟩H , Ψ, Φ ∈H .
Then F is a bilinear form on H .
2.1.2
Sesquilinear forms and a representation theorem
Let V and W be complex vector spaces. A mapping F : V × W →C is
called a sesquilinear form on V × W if (2.1), (2.2), (2.3) and
F(αψ, φ) = α∗F(ψ, φ)
(2.5)
hold for all ψ, ψ1, ψ2 ∈V , φ, φ1, φ2 ∈W and α ∈C. For a sesquilinear form
F on V × W , (2.4) is replaced by

(2.6)
In the case where W = V , we call F a sesquilinear form on V simply.
A sesquilinear form F on V is said to be symmetric or Hermitian if
F(ψ, φ)∗= F(φ, ψ), ψ, φ ∈V . In this case, for all ψ ∈V , F(ψ, ψ) is a real
number. If a symmetric form F on V satisﬁes that, for all ψ ∈V , F(ψ, ψ) ≥
0, then we say that F is positive or non-negative. A symmetric form
F is said to be positive deﬁnite if F is positive and F(ψ, ψ) = 0 implies
ψ = 0. A positive deﬁnite symmetric form on V is nothing but an inner
product of V . On the other hand, a non-negative symmetric form is called
a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product.
A sesquilinear form on a dense subspace of a complex Hilbert space may
have an operator representation:
Theorem 2.1. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and D be a dense sub-
space of H . Let F be a sesquilinear form on D such that there exist a
bijective linear operator A on D (A : D →D) and a constant C > 0
satisfying
|F(ψ, φ)| ≤C∥ψ∥∥Aφ∥,
ψ, φ ∈D.
Then there exists a unique linear operator T on H such that D(T ) = D
and
F(ψ, φ) = ⟨ψ, T φ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈D.
(2.7)
and ∥T φ∥≤C∥Aφ∥, φ ∈D.
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
75
Proof. We ﬁx ψ ∈D and deﬁne ℓ: D →C by
ℓ(φ) := F(ψ, A−1φ),
φ ∈D.
It is easy to see that ℓis a linear functional on D with |ℓ(φ)|
≤
(C∥ψ∥)∥φ∥, φ ∈D.
Hence ℓis a bounded linear functional on D with
∥ℓ∥≤C∥ψ∥. Therefore, by the extension theorem, there exists a unique
eℓ∈H ∗such that ℓ⊂eℓand ∥ℓ∥= ∥eℓ∥. Hence, by Riesz’s representation
theorem (Theorem 1.6), there exists a unique vector uψ ∈H such that
eℓ(φ) = ⟨uψ, φ⟩, φ ∈H and ∥uψ∥= ∥eℓ∥= ∥ℓ∥≤C∥ψ∥.
Now we deﬁne a mapping L : D →H by Lψ := uψ, ψ ∈D. By the
aforementioned result on uψ, L is a bounded linear operator with ∥Lψ∥≤
C∥ψ∥, ψ ∈D. It follows that, for all ψ, φ ∈D. ⟨Lψ, φ⟩= F(ψ, A−1φ).
This means that F(ψ, φ) = ⟨Lψ, Aφ⟩= ⟨ψ, L∗Aφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈D, where
we have used the fact that (L)∗= L∗and D(L∗) = H . Hence, putting
T := L∗A, we obtain (2.7) (note that D(T ) = D(L∗A) = D(A) = D). The
uniqueness of T follows from the denseness of D.
2.1.3
Conjugate bilinear forms
Let V and W be complex vector spaces. A mapping F : V × W →C is
called a conjugate bilinear form on V × W if (2.1), (2.2), (2.5) and
F(ψ, αφ) = α∗F(ψ, φ)
hold for all ψ, ψ1, ψ2 ∈V , φ, φ1, φ2 ∈W and α ∈C. As in (2.4) and (2.6),
the following formula holds:

We denote by L∗(V ×W ) the set of conjugate bilinear forms on V ×W .
For F, G ∈L∗(V × W ) and α ∈C, one can deﬁne the sum F + G ∈
L∗(V × W ) and the scalar multiple αF ∈L∗(V × W ) by
(F + G)(ψ, φ) := F(ψ, φ) + G(ψ, φ),
(αF)(ψ, φ) := αF(ψ, φ),
ψ ∈V , φ ∈W .
With this operation of addition and scalar multiplication, L∗(V × W ) be-
comes a complex vector space.

Tensor Product of Two Hilbert Spaces
Now we consider the case where both of V and W are complex Hilbert
spaces.
Let H1 and H2 be complex Hilbert spaces.
For Ψ ∈H1 and
Φ ∈H2, we deﬁne a mapping Ψ ⊗Φ : H1 × H2 →C by
(Ψ ⊗Φ)(ψ, φ) := ⟨ψ, Ψ⟩H1 ⟨φ, Φ⟩H2 ,
ψ ∈H1, φ ∈H2.
It is easy to see that Ψ ⊗Φ is a conjugate bilinear form on H1 × H2, i.e.,
an element of L∗(H1 × H2), and, for all n, m ∈N, Ψi ∈H1, Φj ∈H2 and
αi, βj ∈C (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m)

(2.8)
The conjugate bilinear form Ψ ⊗Φ is called the tensor product of Ψ and
Φ. Property (2.8) is called the bilinearity of tensor product.
Before proceeding further, we recall some of basic concepts in Hilbert
space theory. Let H be a Hilbert space. A subset D of H is called an
orthogonal system if, for all ψ, φ ∈D with ψ ̸= φ, ψ is orthogonal to
φ: ⟨ψ, φ⟩= 0 (in this case we write ψ ⊥φ). A subset {ψλ}λ∈Λ of H (Λ
is an index set) is called an orthonormal system (ONS) if ⟨ψλ, ψµ⟩=
δλµ, λ, µ ∈Λ, where δλµ is the Kronecker delta: δλµ := 1 if λ = µ; δλµ := 0
if λ ̸= µ. An ONS {ψλ}λ∈Λ is said to be complete if every ψ ∈H has
the series expansion ψ = P
λ∈Λ ⟨ψλ, ψ⟩ψλ, where the sum is over at most
countable subset of Λ which may depend on ψ.
A basic fact concerning ONS is given in the following theorem:
Theorem 2.2 (abstract Riesz-Fischer theorem).
Let H be a Hilbert
space and {en}∞
n=1 be an ONS in H .
Then, for all complex sequences
c = {cn}∞
n=1 (cn ∈C, n ∈N) satisfying P∞
n=1 |cn|2 < ∞, the inﬁnite series
Ψc := P∞
n=1 cnen converges in H and ∥Ψc∥2 = P∞
n=1 |cn|2.
In general, for a non-empty subset D of a vector space, we denote by
span D or span (D) the set of ﬁnite linear combinations of vectors in D,
i.e., the subspace algebraically spanned by all vectors in D.
Let D1 and D2 be a subspace of H1 and H2 respectively. Then we call
the subspace
D1 ˆ⊗D2 := span {Ψ ⊗Φ|Ψ ∈D1, Φ ∈D2} ⊂L∗(H1 × H2)
the algebraic tensor product of D1 and D2. It is obvious that
D1 ˆ⊗D2 ⊂H1 ˆ⊗H2.
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
77
Each element F in D1 ˆ⊗D2 is of the form
F =
n
X
i=1
m
X
j=1
αijΨi ⊗Θj
with n, m ∈N, αij ∈C, Ψi ∈D1 and Θj ∈D2 (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m).
By the bilinearity of tensor product, we obtain
F =
n
X
i=1
Ψi ⊗Φi,
(2.9)
where Φi := Pm
j=1 αijΘj. This is a general form of an element in D1 ˆ⊗D2.
The following fact will be used in what follows:
Lemma 2.1. For each F
∈D1 ˆ⊗D2, there exist orthonormal systems
(ONS’s) {ek}N
k=1 in D1, {fl}M
l=1 in D2 with N, M ∈N and constants ckl ∈C
(k = 1, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . , M) such that
F =

Moreover,

l=1
Ψl ⊗fl,
(2.11)
with Φk := PM
l=1 cklfl ∈D2 and Ψl := PN
k=1 cklek ∈D1.
Proof. We have (2.9). The subspaces M1 := span {Ψi|i = 1, . . . , n} and
M2 := span {Φi|i = 1, . . . , n} are ﬁnite dimensional. Let N and M be the
dimensions of them respectively: N := dim M1 and M := dim M2. Then
we can take an orthonormal basis {ek}N
k=1 of M1 and an orthonormal basis
{fl}M
l=1 of M2. We have
Ψi =
N
X
k=1
⟨ek, Ψi⟩H1 ek,
Φi =

⟨fl, Φi⟩H2 fl.
Putting these equations into (2.9),
we obtain (2.10) with ckl
:=
Pn
i=1 ⟨ek, Ψi⟩H1 ⟨fl, Φi⟩H2. Formula (2.11) easily follows from (2.10).
We next show that H1 ˆ⊗H2 has a natural inner product. For this pur-
pose, we ﬁrst note the following fact:
Lemma 2.2. There exists a unique symmetric form s on H1 ˆ⊗H2 such
that
s(Ψ⊗Φ, Ψ′⊗Φ′) = ⟨Ψ, Ψ′⟩H1 ⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2 ,
Ψ, Ψ′ ∈H1, Φ, Φ′ ∈H2. (2.12)
 

78

and
G :=
m
X
j=1
Ψ′
j ⊗Φ′
j
(2.13)
with m ∈N, Ψ′
j ∈H1 and Φ′
j ∈H2.
Then we deﬁne a mapping s :
(H1 ˆ⊗H2) × (H1 ˆ⊗H2) →C by
s(F, G) :=

i=1

It follows from this relation that s(F, G) is well-deﬁned, i.e., the right hand
side of (2.14) is independent of the way of representing F and G as in (2.9)
and (2.13) respectively. Then it is easy to see that s is a symmetric form
on (H1 ˆ⊗H2) × (H1 ˆ⊗H2) and (2.12) holds.
Uniqueness. Suppose that there exists another symmetric form s′ on
(H1 ˆ⊗H2)×(H1 ˆ⊗H2) such that s′(Ψ⊗Φ, Ψ′⊗Φ′) = ⟨Ψ, Ψ′⟩H1 ⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2 for
all Ψ, Ψ′ ∈H1 and Φ, Φ′ ∈H2. Then s′(Ψ⊗Φ, Ψ′⊗Φ′) = s(Ψ⊗Φ, Ψ′⊗Φ′)
for all Ψ, Ψ′ ∈H1 and Φ, Φ′ ∈H2. It follows from the sesquilinearity of s
and s′ that, for all F, G ∈H1 ˆ⊗H2, s′(F, G) = s(F, G). Hence s′ = s.
Lemma 2.3. The symmetric form s in Lemma 2.2 is an inner product of
H1 ˆ⊗H2.
Proof. We need only to prove the positive deﬁniteness of s. Let F be as
in (2.9) with Ψi ∈H1 and Φi ∈H2. Then, using the representation (2.10),
we have
s(F, F) =
N
X
k=1
M
X
l=1
|ckl|2.
Hence s(F, F) ≥0.
Let s(F, F) = 0. Then ckl = 0 for all k = 1, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . , M. Hence,
by (2.10), F = 0.
By Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3, the following deﬁnition is possible:
Deﬁnition 2.1. We denote by H1⊗H2 the completion of the inner product
space H1 ˆ⊗H2 with the inner product s and call it the tensor product
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
79
Hilbert space or tensor product of H1 and H2. We denote the inner
product of H1 ⊗H2 by ⟨F, G⟩H1⊗H2. An element of H1 ⊗H2 is called a
tensor.
In this way one ﬁnds a structure making a new Hilbert space from each
pair of Hilbert spaces:
⊗: (H1, H2) 7→H1 ⊗H2.
By the deﬁnition of completion of an inner product space, the algebraic
tensor product H1 ˆ⊗H2 is identiﬁed with a dense subspace of H1 ⊗H2.
It follows from (2.12) that, for all Ψ, Ψ′ ∈H1 and Φ, Φ′ ∈H2,
⟨Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ′ ⊗Φ′⟩H1⊗H2 = ⟨Ψ, Ψ′⟩H1 ⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2 .
(2.15)
In particular
∥Ψ ⊗Φ∥H1⊗H2 = ∥Ψ∥H1∥Φ∥H2.
(2.16)
The next proposition states some fundamental structures of the tensor
product Hilbert space H1 ⊗H2.
Proposition 2.1.
(i) (continuity of tensor product operation) Let Ψ, Ψn ∈H1 and Φ, Φn ∈
H2 such that limn→∞Ψn = Ψ, limn→∞Φn = Φ. Then limn→∞Ψn ⊗
Φn = Ψ ⊗Φ.
(ii) If D1 and D2 are dense in H1 and H2 respectively, then D1 ˆ⊗D2 is
dense in H1 ⊗H2.
(iii) Let {Ψk}M
k=1 and {Φl}N
l=1 (N, M ∈N∪{∞}) be ONS’s in H1 and H2
respectively. Then {Ψk ⊗Φl|k = 1, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . M} is an ONS in
H1 ⊗H2 and, for all double sequences a := {akl ∈C|k = 1, . . . , N, l =
1, . . . , M} satisfying PN

(2.18)
(iv) Let {Ψk}M
k=1 and {Φl}N
l=1 (N, M ∈N∪{∞}) be complete orthonormal
systems (CONS’s) of H1 and H2 respectively. Then {Ψk ⊗Φl|1 ≤
k ≤M, 1 ≤l ≤N} is a CONS of H1 ⊗H2. In particular,
dim H1 ⊗H2 = MN.

Proof. Throughout the proof, we omit the subscript H1 ⊗H2 in the inner
product and the norm of H1 ⊗H2.
(i)
∥Ψn ⊗Φn −Ψ ⊗Φ∥= ∥(Ψn −Ψ) ⊗Φn + Ψ ⊗(Φn −Φ)∥
≤∥(Ψn −Ψ) ⊗Φn∥+ ∥Ψ ⊗(Φn −Φ)∥
(by triangle inequality)
= ∥Ψn −Ψ∥∥Φn∥+ ∥Ψ∥∥Φn −Φ∥
(by (2.16))
→0
(n →∞).
Hence Ψn ⊗Φn →Ψ ⊗Φ (n →∞).
(ii) Since H1 ˆ⊗H2 is dense in H1 ⊗H2, it is suﬃcient to prove that
D1 ˆ⊗D2 is dense in H1 ˆ⊗H2. Every element of H1 ˆ⊗H2 is a ﬁnite linear
combination of tensors of the form Ψ⊗Φ with Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2. Hence
it is enough to show that Ψ ⊗Φ is the limit of a sequence in D1 ˆ⊗D2. Since
Dj (j = 1, 2) is dense in Hj, there exist sequences {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D1 and
{Φn}∞
n=1 in D2 such that Ψn →Ψ, Φn →Φ (n →∞). It follows from part
(i) that Ψn ⊗Φn →Ψ ⊗Φ (n →∞). Since {Ψn ⊗Φn}∞
n=1 is a sequence in
D1 ˆ⊗D2, the desired result follows.
With regard to (iii) and (iv), we give a proof in the case M = N = ∞
only; the other cases can be treated similarly.
(iii) Using (2.15), one easily sees that {Ψk ⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1 is an ONS in
H1 ⊗H2. Hence, by Theorem 2.2, the inﬁnite series on the right hand side
of (2.17) converges in H1 ⊗H2 and (2.18) holds.
(iv) Since H1 ˆ⊗H2 is dense in H1 ⊗H2, it is suﬁcient to show that
H1 ˆ⊗H2 ⊂span {Ψk ⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1,
(2.19)
where, for a subset D of a Hilbert space H , D denotes the closure of D
in H . Let Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2. Then we have Ψ = P∞
k=1 akΨk and
Φ = P∞
l=1 blΦl with ak := ⟨Ψk, Ψ⟩H1 and bl := ⟨Φl, Φ⟩H2.
Let Xn :=
Pn
k=1 akΨk and Yn := Pn
l=1 blΦl (n ∈N). Then Xn →Ψ and Yn →Φ
(n →∞). Hence, by part (i), ∥Xn⊗Yn−Ψ⊗Φ∥→0 (n →∞). On the other
hand, Xn⊗Yn = Pn
k,l=1 akblΨk⊗Φl. Hence Xn⊗Yn ∈span {Ψk⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1.
Therefore Ψ ⊗Φ ∈span {Ψk ⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1. Thus (2.19) holds.
Remark 2.1. (i) Proposition 2.1(iv) implies that, if H1 and H2 are sepa-
rable, then so is H1 ⊗H2.
(ii) Proposition 2.1(iv) holds also in the case where H1 and H2 are
not necessarily separable, as is easily inferred from its proof. Namely, if
{Ψα}α∈A and {Φβ}β∈B with A and B being index sets are CONS’s of H1
and H2 respectively, then {Ψα ⊗Φβ}α∈A,β∈B is a CONS of H1 ⊗H2.

Contraction of Tensor Products
Theorem 2.3.
(i) For each Ψ ∈H1 ⊗H2, there exists a unique anti-linear mapping C(1)
Ψ
from H1 to H2 such that, for all ψ1 ∈H1 and ψ2 ∈H2,
⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩=
D

and ∥C(1)
Ψ (ψ1)∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ1∥.
(ii) For each Ψ ∈H1 ⊗H2, there exists a unique anti-linear mapping C(2)
Ψ
from H2 to H1 such that, for all ψ1 ∈H1 and ψ2 ∈H2,
⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩=
D
C(2)
Ψ (ψ2), ψ1
E
H1
and ∥C(2)
Ψ (ψ2)∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ2∥.
Proof. (i) Let ψ1 ∈H1 be ﬁxed arbitrarily. Deﬁne f : H2 →C by
f(ψ2) := ⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩,
ψ2 ∈H2.
Then it is easy to see that f ∈H ∗
2 with ∥f∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ1∥. Hence, by the
Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique vector ηΨ(ψ1) ∈H2
such that
f(ψ2) = ⟨ηΨ(ψ1), ψ2⟩H2 ,
ψ2 ∈H2
and ∥ηΨ(ψ1)∥= ∥f∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ1∥. Hence
⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩= ⟨ηΨ(ψ1), ψ2⟩H2 ,
ψ2 ∈H2.
Then one can deﬁne a mapping C(1)
Ψ
: H1 →H2 by
C(1)
Ψ (ψ1) = ηΨ(ψ1),
ψ1 ∈H1.
It is easy to see that C(1)
Ψ
is anti-linear and ∥C(1)
Ψ (ψ1)∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ1∥. Thus
we obtain
⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩=

C(1)

,
ψ1 ∈H1, ψ2 ∈H2.
(ii) Similar to the proof of (i).
The vector C(1)
Ψ (ψ1) (resp. C(2)
Ψ (ψ2)) is called the contraction of Ψ
with ψ1 (resp. ψ2).
Example 2.3. For all φ1, ψ1 ∈H1 and φ2, ψ2 ∈H2,
C(1)
φ1⊗φ2(ψ1) = ⟨ψ1, φ1⟩φ2,
C(2)
φ1⊗φ2(ψ2) = ⟨ψ2, φ2⟩φ1.

Tensor Product of N Hilbert Spaces with N ≥3
The method to deﬁne the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces given above
can be naturally extended to the case of N Hilbert spaces with N ≥3.
Let V1, . . . , VN be complex vector spaces. Then a mapping F from the
direct product
V1 × · · · × VN := {(ψ1, . . . , ψN)|ψj ∈Vj, j = 1, . . . , N}
to C is called a conjugate N-linear form on V1 ×· · ·×VN if the following
equations hold: for all (ψ1, . . . , ψN) ∈V1 ×· · ·×VN, φj ∈Vj (j = 1, . . . , N)
and α ∈C
F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
ψj + φj, . . . , ψN) = F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
ψ j, . . . , ψN)
+F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
φ j, . . . , ψN),
(2.20)
F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
αψj, . . . , ψN) = α∗F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
ψ j, . . . , ψN).
(2.21)
We denote by L∗(V1 × · · · × VN) the set of conjugate N-linear forms on
V1 × · · · × VN.
As in the case of N = 2, L∗(V1 × · · · × VN) becomes
a complex vector space with the natural operation of addition and scalar
multiplication. Generically a conjugate N-linear form is called a conjugate
multi-linear form or a conjugate multi-linear functional.
Remark 2.2. A concept slightly diﬀerent from conjugate N-linear form
exists. A mapping F : V1 × · · · × VN →C is called an N-linear form on
V1 ×· · ·×VN if (2.20) and (2.21) with α∗replaced by α hold. In particular,
a 2-linear form is a bilinear form. Generically an N-linear form is called a
multi-linear form or a multi-linear functional.
Let H1, . . . , HN be Hilbert spaces. Then, for each Ψj ∈Hj, one can
deﬁne a conjugate N-linear form ⊗N
j=1Ψj on H1 × · · · × HN by
(⊗N
j=1Ψj)(φ1, . . . , φN) :=
N
Y
j=1
⟨φj, Ψj⟩Hj ,
φj ∈Hj, j = 1, . . . , N.
The conjugate N-linear form ⊗N
j=1Ψj is called the tensor product of
vectors Ψ1, . . . , ΨN. This is written also as Ψ1 ⊗Ψ2 ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN.
We introduce a subspace of L∗(H1 × · · · × HN) by
ˆ⊗

j=1Hj := span {Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN|Ψj ∈Hj, j = 1, . . . , N}

and call it the algebraic tensor product of H1, . . . , HN. This subspace
is written also as H1 ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗HN.
As in the case N = 2, there exists a

We denote by ⊗N
j=1Hj the completion of ˆ⊗
N
j=1Hj with respect to the inner
product and call ⊗N
j=1Hj the tensor product Hilbert space or tensor
product of H1, . . . , HN. An element of ⊗N
j=1Hj is called a tensor of N
degree.
If H1 = H2 = · · · = HN = H , then we write ⊗N
j=1Hj = ⊗NH and
call it the N-fold tensor product of H .
As in the case N = 2, for a subspace Dj of Hj (j = 1, . . . , N), we deﬁne
ˆ⊗

j=1Dj by
ˆ⊗

j=1Dj := span {⊗N

Proposition 2.1 is extended to the present case as follows:
Proposition 2.2.

In particular,

Remark 2.3. (i) Proposition 2.2(iv) implies that, if each Hj (j = 1, . . . , N)

(ii) Proposition 2.2(iv) holds also in the case where each Hj (j =

set is a CONS of Hj (j = 1, . . . , N), then {⊗N

αj |αj ∈Aj, j = 1, . . . , N}
is a CONS of ⊗N
j=1Hj.
2.5
Hilbert Space Isomorphisms
Before developing further the theory of tensor product Hilbert spaces, we
here recall an important concept. Two Hilbert spaces H and K are said
to be isomorphic if there exists a unitary operator U from H to K . In
this case we say that H is isomorphic to K under U and we write H
U∼= K
or simply H ∼= K if U is understood.
As is well known, every separable inﬁnite dimensional complex Hilbert
space H is isomorphic to
ℓ2 :=
(
a = {an}∞
n=1
n ∈N, an ∈C,
∞
X
n=1
|an|2 < ∞
)
,
the Hilbert space of absolutely square summable sequences of complex num-
bers, in such a way that each ψ ∈H corresponds to {an(ψ)}∞
n=1 ∈ℓ2 with
an(ψ) = ⟨ψn, ψ⟩H , where {ψn}∞
n=1 is an arbitrary CONS of H . But this
isomorphism is not so useful, because it depends on the choice of CONS
of H , just giving a coordinate representation of each vector in H . One
may call an isomorphism depending on the choice of CONS’s a relative
isomorphism. We emphasize that a useful or meaningful Hilbert space iso-
morphism may be one which has nothing to do with CONS’s of the Hilbert
spaces under consideration. We say that such an isomorphism is absolute
or natural . As will be seen below in this book, natural isomorphisms play
important roles in the theory of tensor product Hilbert spaces.
In establishing an isomorphism between two Hilbert spaces, the next
theorem is fundamental:
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
85
Theorem 2.4 (isomorphism theorem).
Let H and K
be Hilbert
spaces and {ψα}α∈A and {φα}α∈A be CONS’s of H and K respectively,
where A is an index set not necessarily at most countable. Then there exists
a unique unitary transformation U : H →K such that
Uψα = φα,
α ∈A.
Proof. Existence.
For each ψ ∈H , there is an at most countable
subset Aψ of A such that P
α∈Aψ | ⟨ψα, ψ⟩H |2 = ∥ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence,
by the abstract Riesz-Fischer Theorem, P
α∈Aψ ⟨ψα, ψ⟩H φα converges in
K .
Therefore one can deﬁne a mapping U : H
→K
by Uψ :=
P
α∈Aψ ⟨ψα, ψ⟩H φα.
In particular, Uψα = φα.
Then it is easy to see
that U is linear and isometric (i.e., ∥Uψ∥K
= ∥ψ∥H ).
To prove the
surjectivity of U, we note that, for each φ ∈K , P
α∈Bφ | ⟨φα, φ⟩K |2 =
∥φ∥2 < ∞, where Bφ is an at most countable subset of A. Hence ψ :=
P
α∈Bφ ⟨φα, φ⟩K ψα converges in H . Hence Uψ = P
α∈Bφ ⟨φα, φ⟩K φα =
φ, showing that U is surjective. Thus U is unitary.
Uniqueness. Let V : H →K be a bounded linear operator such that
V ψα = φα, α ∈A. Then, by the continuity of V , for all ψ ∈H ,
V ψ =
X
α∈Aψ
⟨ψα, ψ⟩H V ψα =
X
α∈Aψ
⟨ψα, ψ⟩H φα = Uψ.
Hence V = U.
Remark 2.4. (i) The above mentioned isomorphism between a separable
inﬁnite dimensional complex Hilbert space and ℓ2 can be proved by applying
Theorem 2.4. Indeed, we need only to take, as a CONS of ℓ2, the standard
CONS {en}∞
n=1 with en := {0, . . . , 0,
nth
1 , 0, . . .}.
(ii) At ﬁrst sight, the isomorphism U in Theorem 2.4 may seem to
depend on the choice of CONS’s {ψα}α∈A and {φα}α∈A. But this is not
always the case (see, e.g., Proposition 2.3 below). In applications, there
are many cases in which the isomorphism in Theorem 2.4 is in reality an
absolute isomorphism.
We now apply Theorem 2.4 to the tensor product of N Hilbert spaces
H1, . . . , HN. We denote by SN the set of permutations of (1, . . . , N). To
each permutation σ ∈SN, the tensor product Hilbert space ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) is
associated.
Proposition 2.3. For each σ ∈SN, there exists a unique unitary tran-
sormation Uσ : ⊗N
j=1Hj
→⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) such that, for all Ψj ∈Hj
 

86

(j = 1, . . . , N),
Uσ(Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN) = Ψσ(1) ⊗· · · ⊗Ψσ(N).
(2.22)
Proof. We prove the proposition only in the case where each Hj is sep-
arable and inﬁnite dimensional (proof of the other cases is similar). Let
{Ψ(j)
k }∞
k=1 be a CONS of Hj. Then, by Proposition 2.2(iv), the set
n
⊗N
j=1Ψ(σ(j))
kj
|k1, . . . , kn ∈N
o
is a CONS of ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j). Hence, by Theorem 2.4, there exists a unique
unitary transformation Uσ : ⊗N
j=1Hj →⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) such that
Uσ ⊗N
j=1 Ψ(j)
kj = ⊗N
j=1Ψ(σ(j))
kσ(j) .
(2.23)
We have the expansion
Ψj =
∞
X
kj=1
D
Ψ(j)
kj , Ψj
E
Ψ(j)
kj = lim
n→∞Ψj,n,
where Ψj,n := Pn
kj=1
D
Ψ(j)
kj , Ψj
E
Ψ(j)

⊗N
j=1Ψj = lim
n→∞⊗N
j=1Ψj,n

D
Ψ(1)
k1 , Ψ1
E
· · ·
D
Ψ(N)
kN , ΨN
E
⊗N
j=1 Ψ(j)
kj .
Hence, by the continuity of Uσ and (2.23),
Uσ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj = lim
n→∞

k1,...,kN=1
D

kσ(j)
= lim
n→∞⊗N
j=1Ψσ(j),n = ⊗N
j=1Ψσ(j).
Thus (2.22) holds.
Proposition 2.3 shows that ⊗N
j=1Hj is isomorphic to ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) under
Uσ. As is seen, this isomorphism is nothing to do with CONS of ⊗N
j=1Hj.
Based on this fact, we say that Uσ is a natural isomorphism of ⊗N
j=1Hj
with ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j). This natural isomorphism is written as
⊗N
j=1Hj ∼= ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j).
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces

2.6
Tensor Product of L2-Spaces
Let (Xj, Σj, µj) (j = 1, . . . , N) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space. Then, by the
theory in Section 2.4, we can consider the tensor product Hilbert space
⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj).
But this Hilbert space is an abstract one.
Hence it
would be natural to ask if ⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj) can be identiﬁed with a concrete
Hilbert space. In what follows, we show that the answer is aﬃrmative.
Since each measure space (Xj, Σj, µj) is σ-ﬁnite, the direct product
space X1×· · ·×XN becomes a measure space whose Borel ﬁeld and measure
are the product Borel ﬁeld of Σ1, . . . , ΣN and the product measure µ1 ⊗
· · · ⊗µN respectively.
For a measurable function fj on Xj (j = 1, . . . , N), we deﬁne a measur-
able function f1 × · · · × fN on X1 × · · · × XN by
(f1 × · · · × fN)(x) := f1(x1) · · · fN(xN)
for µ1 ⊗· · · ⊗µN-a.e.x = (x1, . . . , xN) ∈X1 × · · · × XN. It follows that, if
fj ∈L2(Xj, dµj) for all j = 1, . . . , N, then
f1 × · · · × fN ∈L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN)
with
∥f1 × · · · × fN∥=
N
Y
j=1
∥fj∥,
where dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN := d(µ1 ⊗· · · ⊗µN).
We ﬁrst note an elementary fact:
Proposition
2.4
(continuity
of
×-operation). Let f (j)
n ,
f (j)
∈
L2(Xj, dµj) (n ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N) such that limn→∞f (j)
n
= f (j) in
L2(Xj, dµj), j = 1, . . . , N. Then
lim
n→∞f (1)
n
× · · · × f (N)
n
= f (1) × · · · × f (N)
(2.24)
in L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN).
Proof. We prove (2.24) only in the case N = 2 (the case N ≥3 can be
proved by induction in N). We set fn := f (1)
n , f := f (1), gn := f (2)
n , g :=
f (2). For µ1 ⊗µ2-a.e. (x1, x2) ∈X1 × X2,
(fn × gn)(x1, x2) −(f × g)(x1, x2) = (fn(x1) −f(x1))gn(x2)
+f(x1)(gn(x2) −g(x2)).
Hence
∥fn × gn −f × g∥≤∥fn −f∥∥gn∥+ ∥f∥∥fn −g∥→0
as n →∞.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The next proposition describes a structure which yields a CONS of
L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN) from CONS’s of L2(Xj, dµj), j =
1, . . . , N.
Proposition
2.5. Let {f (j)
nj }nj∈N be a CONS of L2(Xj, dµj) (j
=
1, . . . , N). Then {f (1)
n1 × · · · × f (N)
nN |nj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N} is a CONS of
L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN).
Proof. We prove the proposition only in the case N = 2 (the case N ≥3
can be proved by induction in N).
We put fn := f (1)
n
and gm := f (2)
m
(n, m ∈N). It is easy to see that D := {fn × gm}n,m∈N is an ONS in
L2(X1 × X2, dµ1 ⊗dµ2). Hence we need only to show that the orthogo-
nal complement D⊥of D is {0}. Let f ∈D⊥. Then, for all n, m ∈N,
⟨f, fn × gm⟩= 0. Hence
R
X1×X2 f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)gm(x2)dµ1 ⊗dµ2 = 0. By
the elementary inequality
|αβ| ≤1
2(|α|2 + |β|2),
α, β ∈C,
(2.25)
one has
|f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)gm(x2)| ≤1
2|f(x1, x2)|2 + 1
2|fn(x1)|2|gm(x2)|2.
Hence the function |f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)gm(x2)| is integrable with respect to
µ1 ⊗µ2 (this can be proved by the Schwarz inequality also). Hence, letting
Fn(x2) :=
R
X1 f(x1, x2)fn(x1)∗dµ1(x1), we have by Fubini’s theorem
Z
X2
Fn(x2)∗gm(x2)dµ2(x2) = 0.
By the Schwarz inequality, we have
|Fn(x2)|2 ≤
Z
X1
|f(x1, x2)|2dµ1(x1)

∥fn∥2.
Hence it follows that Fn ∈L2(X2, dµ2). Therefore ⟨Fn, gm⟩= 0, n, m ∈N.
Since {gm}m∈N is a CONS of L2(X2, dµ2), it follows that Fn = 0, n ∈N.
Hence there exists a measurable set Nn ⊂X2 such that µ2(Nn) = 0 and,
for all x2 ∈X2 \ Nn,
R
X1 f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)dµ1(x1) = 0, i.e., ⟨gx2, fn⟩=
0, x2 ∈X2 \ Nn, where gx2(x1) := f(x1, x2) (note that gx2 ∈L2(X1, dµ1)
for µ2-a.e. x2 ∈X2). Let N0 := ∪∞
n=1Nn. Then µ2(N0) = 0 and, for all
x2 ∈X2 \ N0 and n ∈N, ⟨gx2, fn⟩= 0. Hence gx2 = 0, x2 ∈X2 \ N0.
This implies that
R
X2 dµ2(x2)
R
X1 |f(x1, x2)|2dµ1(x1) = 0. It follows from
Fubini’s theorem again that f = 0. Thus D⊥= {0} as desired.

The main result in this section is:
Theorem 2.5. Suppose that, for each j
= 1, . . . , N, L2(Xj, dµj) is
separable.
Then there exists a unique unitary transformation U
:
⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj) →L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN) such that, for

U

= f1 × · · · × fN.
(2.26)
Proof. We give a proof only in the case where N = 2 and L2(Xj, dµj)
is inﬁnite dimensional (j = 1, 2).
Let fn and gm be as in the proof of
Proposition 2.5. Then, by Proposition 2.5 and Theorem 2.4, there exists a
unique unitary transformation U : L2(X1, dµ1) ⊗L2(X2, dµ2) →L2(X1 ×
X2, dµ1 ⊗dµ2) such that
Ufn ⊗gm = fn × gm,
n, m ∈N.
(2.27)
For each f ∈L2(X1, dµ1) and g ∈L2(X2, dµ2), we have the expansions
f = P∞
n=1 anfn and g = P∞
m=1 bmgm with an := ⟨fn, f⟩and bm := ⟨gm, g⟩.
By Proposition 2.1(i), f ⊗g = limM→∞

where we have used Proposition 2.4 in the last equality.
Theorem 2.5 shows that the tensor product ⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj) is isomor-
phic to L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · dµN). As is seen, this isomorphism
is independent of CONS’s of the Hilbert spaces under consideration and
gives a harmonious correspondence (2.26).
We call the isomorphism in
Theorem 2.5 the natural isomorphism between ⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj) and
L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · dµN). In the sense of this isomorphism, we
write
⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj) ∼= L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · dµN).
Example 2.4. Let d ∈N and take Xj = Rd, Σj = Bd (the Borel ﬁeld
of Rd) with µj being the Lebesgue measure on the Borel measurable space
(Rd, Bd) so that L2(Xj, dµj) = L2(Rd). Then, by Theorem 2.5, we have
⊗NL2(Rd) ∼= L2((Rd)N) = L2(RdN).
This natural isomorphism is very useful in applications to mathematical
theory of quantum many-body systems.

Tensor Product of an L2-Space and a Hilbert Space
Let (X, Σ, µ) be a measure space and H be a Hilbert space. Then the
tensor product Hilbert space L2(X, dµ) ⊗H is considered. In this section
we describe a natural isomorphism of L2(X, dµ) ⊗H to a concrete Hilbert
space.
Let
H X := {F : X →H },
the set of mappings from X to H . Then, for F, G ∈H X, the pointwise
inner product ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H (x ∈X) gives a complex-valued function on
X: x 7→⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H . It may be natural to deﬁne an inner product of F
and G by
R
X ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H dµ(x) if ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H is Σ-measurable and
integrable with respect to µ. With this heuristic motivation, we introduce
a concept of measurability for elements of H X:
Deﬁnition 2.2. An element F ∈H X is said to be weakly Σ-measurable
or weakly measurable if, for all Ψ ∈H , the complex-valued function
: X ∋x 7→⟨Ψ, F(x)⟩H on X is Σ-measurable. We denote by M(X, H )
the set of weakly Σ-measurable mappings from X to H .
Remark 2.5. Besides the weak measurability, there are two diﬀerent con-
cepts of measurability for elements of H X, called strong measurability
and Borel measurability respectively (see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1980)],
pp.115–116). One has the following logical relation [Reed and Simon (1980),
p.116, Proposition]:
strongly measurable =⇒Borel measurable =⇒weakly measurable
But, it turns out that, in the case where H is separable, these three con-
cepts of measurability are equivalent [Reed and Simon (1980), Theorem
IV.22]. In many cases of applications of the theory on the mapping space
H X to quantum ﬁeld theory, H is separable. Therefore, for the purpose
of the present book, it is enough to consider the case where H is separable
and weak measurable functions in H X.
Throughout this section, we assume that H is separable.
Lemma 2.4. For all F, G ∈M(X, H ), the function : X
∋x 7→
⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H on X is Σ-measurable. In particular, the function : X ∋
x 7→∥F(x)∥2
H is Σ-measurable.
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
91
Proof. Let {Φn}n∈N be a CONS of H (we give a proof only in the case
where H is inﬁnite dimensional). Then we have
⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H = lim
N→∞
N
X
n=1
⟨F(x), Φn⟩H ⟨Φn, G(x)⟩H .
Since the function: x 7→PN
n=1 ⟨F(x), Φn⟩H ⟨Φn, G(x)⟩H is Σ-measurable
and the limit of a sequence of Σ-measurable functions is Σ-measurable, it
follows that ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H is Σ-measurable.
By virtue of Lemma 2.4, one can deﬁne
L2(X, dµ; H ) :=

F ∈M(X, H )|
Z
X
∥F(x)∥2
H dµ(x) < ∞

.
(2.28)
We call it the L2-space of H -valued functions on the measure
space (X, Σ, µ).
In L2(X, dµ; H ), the concept of equality F
= G
(F, G ∈L2(X, dµ; H )) is deﬁned as follows:
F = G
def
⇐⇒F(x) = G(x) for µ-a.e.x ∈X.
It follows from the Schwarz inequality for inner product and (2.25) that
| ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H | ≤1
2(∥F(x)∥2
H + ∥G(x)∥2
H ),
F, G ∈H X, x ∈X.
Hence, for all F, G ∈L2(X, dµ; H ), one can deﬁne a complex number
⟨F, G⟩L2(X,dµ;H ) by
⟨F, G⟩L2(X,dµ;H ) :=
Z
X
⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H dµ(x).
It is easy to see that the mapping:(F, G) 7→⟨F, G⟩L2(X,dµ;H ) is an inner
product of L2(X, dµ; H ). Moreover, in the same way as in the proof of com-
pleteness of L2(X, dµ) (= L2(X, dµ; C)), one can prove that L2(X, dµ; H )
is complete with respect to the inner product ⟨, ⟩L2(X,dµ;H ) (Problem 5).
Thus L2(X, dµ; H ) is a Hilbert space with inner product ⟨, ⟩L2(X,dµ;H ).
For any Σ-measurable function f : X →C ∪{±∞} µ-a.e. ﬁnite and
Ψ ∈H , we deﬁne a product f × Ψ ∈M(X, H ) by
(f × Ψ)(x) := f(x)Ψ,
µ-a.e.x ∈X.
As is easily seen, if f is in L2(X, dµ), then f × Ψ ∈L2(X, dµ; H ) and,
for all g ∈L2(X, dµ) and Φ ∈H ,
⟨f × Ψ, g × Φ⟩L2(X,dµ;H ) = ⟨f, g⟩L2(X,dµ) ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩H .
(2.29)
Proposition 2.6. Let fn, f ∈L2(X, dµ) and Ψn, Ψ ∈H be such that
limn→∞fn = f and limn→∞Ψn = Ψ. Then limn→∞fn × Ψn = f × Ψ.

Proof. Similar to the proof of Proposition 2.4.
Proposition 2.7. Let {fm}∞
m=1 be a CONS of L2(X, dµ) and {Φn}∞
n=1 be
a CONS of H . Then {fm × Φn}m,n∈N is a CONS of L2(X, dµ; H ).
Proof. The orthonormality of {fm × Φn}m,n∈N follows from (2.29). To
prove the completeness of it, let F
∈
({fm × Φn}m,n∈N)⊥so that
⟨F, fm × Φn⟩= 0, m, n ∈N. This implies that
R
X ⟨F(x), Φn⟩fm(x)dµ(x) =
0, m, n ∈N. Hence, in the same way as in the proof of Proposition 2.5,
one can show that, for all n ∈N, ⟨F(x), Φn⟩= 0, µ-a.e.x. Hence F(x) = 0
for µ-a.e.x, implying F = 0 as an element of L2(X, dµ; H ). Thus the ONS
{fm × Φn}m,n∈N in L2(X, dµ; H ) is complete.
Theorem 2.6. Suppose that L2(X, dµ) is separable. Then there exists a
unique unitary transformation U: L2(X, dµ) ⊗H →L2(X, dµ; H ) such
that
U(f ⊗Ψ) = f × Ψ,
f ∈L2(X, dµ), Ψ ∈H .
Proof. Let {fm}∞
m=1 and {Φn}∞
n=1 be as in Proposition 2.7. Then, by this
proposition, Proposition 2.1(iv) and Theorem 2.4, there exists a unique
unitary transformation U : L2(X, dµ) ⊗H
→L2(X, dµ; H ) such that
U(fm ⊗Φn) = fm × Φn, m, n ∈N. For all f ∈L2(X, dµ) and Ψ ∈H , we

The unitary transformation U in Theorem 2.6 gives an isomorphism
between L2(X, dµ) ⊗H and L2(X, dµ; H ). We call this isomorphism the
natural isomorphism between L2(X, dµ) ⊗H and L2(X, dµ; H ) and
write
L2(X, dµ) ⊗H ∼= L2(X, dµ; H ).
By this fact and Proposition 2.4, we have
H ⊗L2(X, dµ) ∼= L2(X, dµ; H )
with correspondence Ψ ⊗f 7→f × Ψ (f ∈L2(X, dµ), Ψ ∈H ).
Example 2.5. Let d, r ∈N and Cr := {(z1, . . . , zr)|zj ∈C, j = 1, . . . , r},
the r-dimensional complex Euclidean (Hermitian) space. Then
L2(Rd) ⊗Cr ∼= L2(Rd, dx; Cr) ∼= Cr ⊗L2(Rd)
Henceforth we write L2(Rd; Cr) instead of L2(Rd, dx; Cr). In applications to
quantum mechanics, L2(Rd; Cr) describes a Hilbert space of state vectors of
a quantum system consisting of a quantum particle (an elementary particle,
an atom, a molecule, an ion etc.) in Rd with internal degrees of freedom.1
Corollary 2.1. Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N, N ≥2) be separable Hilbert spaces
and (Xj, Σj, µj) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space such that each L2(Xj, dµj)
is separable.
Then there exists a unique unitary transformation U
:

such that, for all fj ∈L2(Xj, dµj) and Ψj ∈Hj (j = 1, . . . , N),
U(f1 ⊗Ψ1) ⊗· · · ⊗(fN ⊗ΨN) = (f1 × · · · × fN) × (⊗N
j=1Ψj).
Proof. This is due to the following sequence of isomorphisms:

 ∼= (⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dµj)) ⊗(⊗N

j=1Hj)
(by Theorem 2.5)
∼= L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dµ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dµN; ⊗N
j=1Hj)
(by Theorem 2.6).
Example 2.6. Let d, N, r ∈N. Then
⊗NL2(Rd; Cr) ∼= ⊗N[L2(Rd) ⊗Cr] ∼= L2(RdN; ⊗NCr).
1In quantum mechanics, a state of a quantum system S is described by a ray [Ψ] :=
{αΨ|α ∈C \ {0}} for a non-zero vector Ψ in a Hilbert space H . A vector in [Ψ] is
called a state vector of the state [Ψ] and H is called a Hilbert space of states for
S. It is obvious that two states [Ψ] and [Φ] (Φ ∈H ) are identical (i.e., Ψ represents the
same state as that Φ does) if and only there exists a non-zero constant α ∈C such that
Ψ = αΦ.

There is another view-point to L2(X, dµ; H ).
Example 2.7. Let δa be the delta-measure with support {a} ⊂X (i.e., for
each B ∈Σ, δa(B) = 1 if a ∈B and δa(B) = 0 if a ̸∈B) and consider the
case where µ = µn := Pn
j=1 δaj (a1, . . . , an ∈X, aj ̸= ak, j ̸= k). Then, for
all f ∈L2(X, dµn; H ), ∥f∥2 =
R
X ∥f(x)∥2dµn = Pn
j=1 ∥f(aj)∥2. Hence
one can deﬁne a mapping Wn : L2(X, dµn; H ) →⊕nH by
Wnf := (f(a1), . . . , f(an)) ∈⊕nH .
It follows that Wn is unitary. Hence L2(X, dµn; H )
Wn
∼= ⊕nH . In this
sense, we write L2(X, dµn; H ) = ⊕nH .
As a generalization of the view-point shown in the preceding example,
one can take a similar view-point in the case of a general measure µ on
(X, Σ) too. Namely, for each element ψ in L2(X, dµ; H ), one can assign
an element ˜ψ = (ψ(x))x∈X in the direct product Q
x∈X Hx of Hx = H
(∀x ∈X) with inner product
D
˜ψ, ˜φ
E
:=
Z
X
⟨ψ(x), φ(x)⟩H dµ(x),
˜φ = (φ(x))x∈X, φ ∈L2(X, dµ; H ).
From this view-point, we write
L2(X, dµ; H ) =
Z ⊕
X
H dµ
and call it the constant ﬁbre direct integral over (X, µ) with ﬁbre H .
Let A(·) be a mapping from X to L(H ) (the set of linear operators on
H ) (i.e., for each x ∈X, A(x) ∈L(H )). We remark that A(x) is not
necessarily bounded. From this mapping, a linear operator A on
R ⊕
X H dµ
is deﬁned as follows:
D(A) :=

ψ ∈
Z ⊕
X
H dµ
for a.e.x, ψ(x) ∈D(A(x)) and
A(·)ψ(·) ∈M(X, H ) with
R
X ∥A(x)ψ(x)∥2dµ(x) < ∞

,
(2.30)
(Aψ)(x) := A(x)ψ(x),
a.e.x,
ψ ∈D(A).
(2.31)
The operator A is called the direct integral operator (or simply the
direct integral) of {A(x)}x∈X or A(·) with respect to µ and written as
A =
R ⊕
X A(x)dµ(x).
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces

An operator A on
R ⊕
X H dµ is said to be decomposable if there is a
mapping A(·) : X →L(H ) such that (2.30) and (2.31) hold.
A mapping A(·) : X 7→L(H ) is called a constant-operator-valued
mapping if there is an operator C ∈L(H ) such that, for all x ∈X,
A(x) = C. In this case, we write
R ⊕
X A(x)dµ =
R ⊕
X Cdµ.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A bounded operator-valued mapping B(·) : X →B(H )
on X (i.e., for each x ∈X, B(x) ∈B(H )) is said to be measurable if,
for all ψ, φ ∈H , the function : X∋x 7→⟨ψ, B(x)φ⟩∈C is measurable.
Lemma 2.5. Let B(·) : X →B(H ) be measurable such that, for some
constant b > 0,
∥B(x)∥≤b,
a.e.x ∈X.
Then B =
R ⊕
X B(x)dµ(x) is an everywhere deﬁned bounded operator on
L2(X, dµ; H ) and ∥B∥≤b.
Proof. Since D(B(x)) = H , for all ψ ∈
R ⊕
X H dµ(x), B(x)ψ(x) is mea-
surable and
Z
X
∥B(x)ψ(x)∥2dµ(x) ≤b2∥ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence D(B) = L2(X, dµ; H ) and ∥Bψ∥≤b∥ψ∥. Thus the desired result
follows.
In applications to quantum physics, it is important to know when a
decomposable operator A =
R ⊕
X A(x)dµ(x) becomes self-adjoint. Hence we
next consider a suﬃcient condition for A to be self-adjoint.
Deﬁnition 2.4. A mapping A(·) : X →L(H ) is called a self-adjoint
mapping if, for each x ∈X, A(x) is self-adjoint and the mapping : X ∋
x 7→(A(x) + i)−1 ∈B(H ) is measurable.
Lemma 2.6. Let A(·) : X →L(H ) be a self-adjoint mapping. Then the
mapping : X ∋x 7→(A(x) −i)−1 ∈B(H ) is measurable.
Proof. By the present assumption, for all ψ, φ ∈H , the function : X ∋
x 7→

ψ, (A(x) + i)−1φ

∈C is measurable. Hence the mapping : X ∋x 7→

ψ, (A(x) + i)−1φ
∗∈C also is measurable. Since A(x) is self-adjoint, it
follows that

ψ, (A(x) + i)−1φ
∗=

φ, (A(x) −i)−1ψ

. Thus the mapping
: x 7→(A(x) −i)−1 is measurable.

Theorem 2.7. Let A(·) : X →L(H ) be a self-adjoint mapping. Then
A =
R ⊕
X A(x)dµ(x) is self-adjoint.
Proof. By Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6, C± :=
R ⊕
X (A(x) ± i)−1dµ(x) are bounded
operators on L2(X, dµ; H ). It is easy to see that C± are injective. Since
A(x)(A(x) + i)−1 = 1 −i(A(x) + i)−1,
x ∈X,
A(x)(A(x)+i)−1 is bounded with ∥A(x)(A(x)+i)−1∥≤2 and the mapping
: x 7→A(x)(A(x) + i)−1 is measurable. For all φ ∈L2(X, dµ; H ),
Z
X
∥A(x)(A(x) + i)−1φ(x)∥2dµ(x) ≤4∥φ∥2 < ∞.
Hence C+φ ∈D(A). By direct computations, one obtains (A + i)C+φ = φ.
Hence (A+i)C+ = 1. Similarly one can show that (A−i)C−= 1. Therefore
Ran(A ± i) = L2(X, dµ; H ). It is easy to see that, for all ψ, φ ∈D(A),
⟨ψ, Aφ⟩= ⟨Aψ, φ⟩. Hence, if D(A) is dense, then it follows from a basic
criterion on self-adjointness (Proposition 1.17) that A is self-adjoint.
To show that D(A) is dense, let φ ∈D(A)⊥. Then, for all ψ ∈D(A),
0 = ⟨φ, ψ⟩= ⟨(A + i)C+φ, ψ⟩= ⟨C+φ, (A −i)ψ⟩.
Since Ran(A −i) =
L2(X, dµ; H ) as shown above, C+φ = 0. Since C+ is injective, φ = 0.
Hence D(A)⊥= {0}, implying that D(A) is dense.
2.9
Permutation Operators, Symmetric Tensor Products
and Anti-symmetric Tensor Products
As is well known in quantum mechanics, a system of identical quantum
particles may have symmetries with respect to permutations of them. In
this section we present some concepts to formulate such symmetries.
2.9.1
Permutation operators
Let H be a Hilbert space and σ ∈SN (N ∈N). Then, by Proposition
2.3, there exists a unique unitary transformation Uσ on the N-fold tensor
product ⊗NH such that, for all Ψj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , N),
Uσ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj = ⊗N
j=1Ψσ(j).
(2.32)
We call Uσ the permutation operator with respect to σ ∈SN on ⊗NH .
Some elementary properties of it are given in the next proposition:
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
97
Proposition 2.8.
(i) For all σ, τ ∈SN,
UτUσ = Uστ.
(2.33)
(Note that the right hand side is not Uτσ.)
(ii) For all σ ∈SN,
U −1
σ
= Uσ−1
(2.34)
and
U ∗
σ = Uσ−1,
(2.35)
where U ∗
σ denotes the adjoint of Uσ.
Proof. (i) Let Ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N, and Φj := Ψσ(j). Then, by (2.32),
UτUσ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj = Uτ ⊗N
j=1 Φj = ⊗N
j=1Φτ(j) = ⊗N
j=1Ψ(στ)(j) = Uστ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj.
This implies that UτUσ = Uστ on span {⊗N
j=1Ψj|Ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N},
the subspace algebraically spanned by the set {⊗N
j=1Ψj|Ψj ∈H , j =
1, . . . , N}. This subspace is dense in ⊗NH . Hence, by Theorem 1.2, (2.33)
holds.
(ii) Taking τ = σ−1 in (2.33), we have Uσ−1Uσ = I (the identity on H ).
We already know that Uσ is unitary. Hence (2.34) follows. The unitarity
of Uσ implies that U ∗
σ = U −1
σ . Hence (2.35) follows from (2.34).
To see a mathematical meaning of Proposition 2.8 from a higher view-
point, we recall some concepts in the group theory.
2.9.2
Basic elements in group theory
A set G is called a semi-group if there exists a mapping: G×G ∋(a, b) 7→
ab ∈G such that, for all a, b, c ∈G, (ab)c = a(bc) (composition law). The
mapping : (a, b) 7→ab is called the semi-group operation. If there exists
an element e ∈G such that, for all a ∈G, ae = ea = a, then G is said to
be unitary and e is called the unit element in G. It is easy to see that e
is unique.
If ab = ba for all a, b ∈G, then G is said to be commutative or
Abelian.
A subset H of a semi-group G is called a subsemi-group of G if it is
a semi-group with respect to the semi-group operation of G.
A set G is called a group if it is a unitary semi-group with the following
additional property (existence of inverse element): for each a ∈G, there
exists an element a−1 in G such that aa−1 = a−1a = e. The element a−1
 

98
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is called the inverse element of a (it is easy to see that a−1 is uniquely
determined). For a group G, the operation : G × G ∋(a, b) 7→ab is called
the group operation of G.
Example 2.8. The set SN is a group with operation SN ×SN ∋(σ, τ) 7→
στ ∈SN (σ, τ ∈SN). This group is called the symmetry group of
order N. If N ≥3, then SN is non-commutative.
A subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if it is a group with the
group operation of G.
For each a ∈G and a subset F of G, the subsets aF and Fa of G are
deﬁned by aF := {af|f ∈F} and Fa := {fa|f ∈F}. Also the subset aFb
(a, b ∈G) is deﬁned by aFb := {afb|f ∈F}.
A subgroup N of G is said to be normal if, for all a ∈G, aNa−1 = N.
For subsets G1, G2 of G, the subset G1G2 of G is deﬁned by
G1G2 := {ab|a ∈G1, b ∈G2}.
Let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then, it is easy to see that, for all
a, b ∈G,
(aN)(bN) = abN.
Hence, it follows that the set
G/N := {aN|a ∈G}
becomes a group with the product operation of subsets. The unit element
of G/N is N and the inverse element of aN is a−1N. This group is called
the residue class group modulo N or the quotient group by N or the
factor group by N. A subset of the form aN (a ∈G) is called a coset
with respect to N.
Let G and H be groups. A mapping ρ : G →H is called a homomor-
phism if ρ(ab) = ρ(a)ρ(b), a, b ∈G.
Let ρ : G →H be a homomorphism and denote by eG (resp. eH) the
unit element of G (resp. H) . Then ρ(eG)ρ(eG) = ρ(e2
G) = ρ(eG). Hence
ρ(eG) = eH.
Hence the subset
N(ρ) := {g ∈G|ρ(g) = eH}
of G contains eG. The set N(ρ) is called the kernel of ρ.
It is easy to see that ρ is injective if and only if N(ρ) = {eG}.
The kernel N(ρ) is a normal subgroup.
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
99
A bijective homomorphism ρ : G →H is called an isomorphism. The
groups G and H are said to be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism
ρ : G →H. In this case, we write G
ρ∼
=H or simply G ∼= H if the isomorphism
is understood. Two isomorphic groups can be regarded as identical ones as
groups.
It is not so diﬃcult to prove the following theorem, which is a basic one
in group theory:
Theorem 2.8 (homomorphism theorem). Let ρ : G →H be a homo-
morphism. Then the mapping ˆρ : G/N(ρ) →ρ(G) deﬁned by ˆρ(aN(ρ)) :=
ρ(a), a ∈G is an isomorphism, i.e., G/N(ρ) ∼= ρ(G). In particular, if ρ is
surjective in addition, then G/N(ρ) ∼= H.
Let V be a vector space over K. Then the set GL(V ) of bijective linear
mappings on V is a group with the product operation of mappings on V .
The group GL(V ) is called the general linear group on V .
A homomorphism ρ : G →GL(V ) is called a representation of G on
V . In this case, V is called the representation space of G. A represen-
tation ρ of G on V is sometimes denoted (ρ, V ) or {ρ(g)|g ∈G}.
In the case where G is a topological space and V is ﬁnite dimensional,
ρ is said to be continuous if ρ(g) is continuous in g ∈G in the standard
topology of V .
If ρ is injective, then it is called a faithful representation of G.
A subspace M is called an invariant subspace of ρ if, for all g ∈G,
ρ(g)M ⊂M .
It follows that, for any invariant subspace M of ρ, ρ(g)M = M , g ∈G.
It is obvious that V and {0} ⊂V are invariant subspaces of ρ. But
these are called trivial invariant subspaces.
An invariant subspace M of ρ is said to be non-trivial if M ̸= {0}, V .
A representation ρ : G →GL(V ) is said to be irreducible if it has no
non-trivial invariant subspace.
If V is a Hilbert space H and ρ(g) is unitary for all g ∈G, then ρ is
called a unitary representation of G on H .
In the case where G is a topological space, a unitary representation
ρ : G →GL(H ) is said to be strongly continuous if, for all Ψ ∈H , the
mapping : G ∋g 7→ρ(g)Ψ ∈H is continuous.
A group G is called a topological group if G is a topological space
and the mappings: G × G ∋(g1, g2) 7→g1g2 ∈G and G ∋g 7→g−1 ∈G are
continuous.

Example 2.9. For each n ∈N, Rn is a commutative group with group
operation: Rn × Rn ∋(a, b) 7→a + b ∈Rn. The space Rn in this sense is
called the n-dimensional translation group. This is a topological group.
Let {U(t)}t∈R be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on a
Hilbert space H . Then the mapping U : R →GL(H ); R ∋t 7→U(t)
is a strongly continuous unitary representation of R as the 1-dimensional
translation group.
2.9.3
Unitary repesentation of SN
We now come back to Proposition 2.8. One can deﬁne a mapping ρN :
SN →GL(⊗NH ) by
ρN(σ) := Uσ−1,
σ ∈SN.
Then Proposition 2.8 implies that ρN(σ) is unitary and
ρN(στ) = ρN(σ)ρN(τ),
σ, τ ∈SN.
Hence ρN is a unitary representation of the symmetry group SN on ⊗NH .
Thus ⊗NH carries a unitary representation of SN.

SN (resp.
AN) is called the symmetrization operator (resp.
anti-
symmetrization operator) on ⊗NH . Basic properties of these operators
are summarized in the following theorem:
Theorem 2.9.
(i) For each σ ∈SN,
UσSN = SNUσ = SN,

(vii) For all N ≥2, SNAN = ANSN = 0 and Ran(SN) is orthogonal to
Ran(AN): Ran(SN) ⊥Ran(AN).

UσSN = 1
N!
X
τ∈SN
UσUτ = 1
N!
X
τ∈SN
Uτσ.
It is well known that the mapping τ 7→τσ is bijective. Hence the right
hand side is equal to SN. Similarly one can show that SNUσ = SN.
To prove (2.39), we ﬁrst note that (2.37) and (2.33) imply
UσAN = 1
N!
X
τ∈SN
sgn(τ)Uτσ.
(2.41)
Using the well known property
sgn(τσ) = sgn(τ)sgn(σ),
τ, σ ∈SN
and sgn(σ)2 = 1, one sees that sgn(τ) = sgn(τσ)sgn(σ). Hence the right
hand side of (2.41) is equal to sgn(σ)AN. Thus (2.39) follows. Similarly
one can show that ANUσ = sgn(σ)AN.
(ii) By (2.33), we have
S2
N = 1

Since the mapping:σ 7→σ−1 is bijective, the right hand side is equal to SN.
Thus S∗

(iii) Similar to the proof of (ii).

(iv) We have
SN(⊗N
j=1ψσ(j)) = SNUσ(⊗N
j=1ψj)
= SN(⊗N
j=1ψj)
(by (2.38)).
(v) Similar to the proof of (iv).
(vi) Let ψi = ψj (i ̸= j) and take σ = (i, j) the transposition of i
and j.
Then sgn(σ) = −1.
Hence (2.40) implies that AN(⊗N
j=1ψj) =
−AN(⊗N
j=1ψj). Hence AN(⊗N
j=1ψj) = 0.
(vii) Using (2.39), we have
ANSN = 1

X
σ∈SN
ANUσ = 1

sgn(σ)AN.
If N ≥2, then P
σ∈SN sgn(σ) = 0. Hence ANSN = 0 (N ≥2). Taking the
adjoint of the both sides and using the self-adjointness of SN and AN (see
(ii) and (iii)), we have SNAN = 0.
Theorem 2.9(ii) and (iii) show that SN and AN are orthogonal projec-
tions. Since the range of an orthogonal projection is closed, the subspaces
⊗N
s H := Ran(SN)
(2.42)
and
∧N(H ) := Ran(AN)
(2.43)
are Hilbert spaces as closed subspaces of ⊗NH . The former is called the
N-fold symmetric tensor product of H and the latter is called the
N-fold anti-symmetric tensor product of H . Also the symbol ⊗N
asH
or ∧NH may be used instead of ∧N(H ). We call an element of ⊗N
s H
(resp. ∧NH ) an N-fold symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric) tensor on
H .
It immediately follows from (2.42) and (2.43) that
SNΨ = Ψ,

ANΦ = Φ,

CONS’s of ⊗N

We next show how CONS’s of ⊗N
s H and ∧N(H ) are made of CONS’s of
H .
We consider the case of ⊗N

deﬁne their product ψ1 . . . ψN ∈⊗N

ψ1 . . . ψN := SN

By Theorem 2.9(iv), we have
ψ1 . . . ψN = ψσ(1) . . . ψσ(N),
σ ∈SN.
Hence the product operation is commutative.
By (2.44) and the fact that S∗

For vectors ψ1, . . . , ψr ∈H (r ∈N) and nj ∈N with Pr

In the sum on the right hand side, only the following permutations σ con-
tribute to it:
{σ(1), . . . , σ(n1)} = {1, . . . , n1},
{σ(n1 + 1), . . . , σ(n1 + n2)} = {n1 + 1, . . . , n1 + n2},
...
{σ(n1 + · · · + nr−1 + 1), . . . , σ(N)} = {n1 + · · · + nr−1 + 1, . . . , N}.
The number of these permutations is n1! · · · nr! and the value of the sum-
mand with such σ’s is one. Hence (2.48) holds.
Proposition 2.9. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of H and N ≥2 and
Cj1···jN :=
1
∥ej1 · · · ejN ∥,
ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N, j1 ≤· · · ≤jN.
(2.49)
Then the set

(2.50)
is a CONS of ⊗N
s H .
Proof. Let j1 ≤· · · ≤jN and k1 ≤· · · ≤kN (ji, ki ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N).
Then, by Lemma 2.7, we have
⟨ej1 · · · ejN , ek1 · · · ekN⟩= 1

If {j1, . . . , jN} ̸= {k1, . . . , kN} in the sense of set, then there is no σ ∈SN
such that j1 = kσ(1), . . . , jN = kσ(N). Hence the right hand side of the
above equation is zero. Therefore ⟨ej1 · · · ejN, ek1 · · · ekN ⟩= 0. This shows
that {Cj1···jN ej1 · · · ejN |j1 ≤· · · ≤jN, ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N} is an ONS
in ⊗N
s (H ). To prove the completeness of this ONS, let Ψ ∈⊗N
s H be
such that ⟨Ψ, ej1 · · · ejN ⟩= 0 for all j1, . . . , jN ∈N with j1 ≤· · · ≤jN.
For each set {k1, . . . , kN} with kj ∈N, there exists a σ ∈SN such that

kσ(1) ≤· · · ≤kσ(N). Hence

Ψ, ekσ(1) · · · ekσ(N)

= 0. By Theorem 2.9(iv)
and (2.46), we have

Ψ, ekσ(1) · · · ekσ(N)

= ⟨Ψ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN⟩.
Hence ⟨Ψ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN ⟩= 0. Since {ek1 ⊗· · ·⊗ekN|ki ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N}
is a CONS of ⊗NH by Proposition 2.2(iv), it follows that Ψ = 0. Thus the
ONS {Cj1···jN ej1 · · · ejN |j1 ≤· · · ≤jN, ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N} is complete.
Remark
2.6. Let ei1, . . . , eir
be the mutually diﬀerent elements in
{ej1, . . . , ejN } (j1 ≤· · · ≤jN) (i1 < · · · < ir). Then there exists a unique
set {n1, . . . , nr} with nj ∈N such that Pr
j=1 nj = N and
ej1 · · · ejN = en1
i1 · · · enr
ir .
Hence, by (2.48), we have
Cj1···jN =

n1! · · · nr!.
(2.51)
This shows that Cj1···jN is independent of the choice of CONS {ej}∞

2.9.6
CONS’s of ∧N(H )
We next consider the case of ∧N(H ). For vectors ψ1, . . . , ψN ∈H , we
deﬁne the exterior product ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN ∈∧N(H ) by
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN :=
√
N!AN(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψN).
It follows from Theorem 2.9(v) that ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN is anti-symmetric with
respect to permutations of ψ1, . . . , ψN:
ψσ(1) ∧· · · ∧ψσ(N) = sgn(σ)ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN,
σ ∈SN.
(2.53)
This property has an important consequence:
Proposition 2.10. If there exists a pair (i, j) (i ̸= j) such that ψi = ψj,
then
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN = 0.
(2.54)
Proof. Applying (2.53) to the case σ = (i, j), the transposition of i and j,
and using the fact sgn(i, j) = −1, we have
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN = −ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN.
Hence (2.54) holds.
Remark 2.8. In the context of quantum mechanics, the fact stated in
Proposition 2.10 appears as the Pauli principle in the system of many
identical fermions.
By (2.45), we have for all Φ ∈∧N(H )
⟨Φ, ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN⟩=
√
N! ⟨Φ, ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψN⟩.
(2.55)
Lemma 2.8. For all ψj, φj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N,

which is equal to the right hand side of (2.56).
 

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces

Formula (2.56) is rewritten as follows:
⟨ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN, φ1 ∧· · · ∧φN⟩= det M(ψ, φ),
the determinant of the matrix M(ψ, φ) := (⟨ψj, φk⟩)j,k=1,...,N (the (j, k)
component of M(ψ, φ) is ⟨ψj, φk⟩).
Proposition 2.11. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of H and N ≥2. Then the
set
{ei1 ∧· · · ∧eiN|i1 < i2 < · · · < iN, ij ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N}
(2.57)
is a CONS of ∧N(H ).
Proof. The orthonormality of the set given by (2.57) follows from Lemma
2.8. To prove its completeness, let Φ ∈∧N(H ) be such that, for all ij ∈N
(j = 1, . . . , N) with i1 < · · · < iN, ⟨Φ, ei1 ∧· · · ∧eiN ⟩= 0.
By The-
orem 2.9(vi), this equation extends to all ij ∈N with i1 ≤· · · ≤iN.
For each set {k1, . . . , kN} with kj ∈N, there is a σ ∈SN such that
kσ(1) ≤· · · ≤kσ(N). By (2.53), ek1 ∧· · · ∧ekN = sgn(σ)ekσ(1) ∧· · · ∧ekσ(N).
Hence we have ⟨Φ, ek1 ∧· · · ∧ekN⟩= 0 for all kj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N. But,
by (2.55), the left hand side is equal to
√
N! ⟨Φ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN ⟩. Hence
⟨Φ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN⟩= 0. Therefore Φ = 0, implying the completeness of
the ONS given by (2.57).
Remark 2.9. If H is ﬁnite-dimensional with dim H = d, then, for all
N > d, ∧N(H ) = {0} and, for 1 ≤N ≤d,
{ei1 ∧· · · ∧eiN|1 ≤i1 < i2 < · · · < iN ≤d, j = 1, . . . , N}
is a CONS of ∧N(H ). Hence ∧N(H ) is ﬁnite-dimensional and
dim ∧N(H ) = dCN =

Symmetric and Anti-symmetric State Functions in
Quantum Mechanics
In this section, we describe elementary applications of the theory given in
the preceding sections to the theory of many-body quantum systems. A
typical one of such quantum systems is a system of N quantum particles
being in the d-dimensional Euclidean vector space Rd with N ≥2 and
d ∈N. If the quantum particles are mutually diﬀerent in their kind, then
one can take L2((Rd)N) = L2(RdN) as a Hilbert space of states for the
system. We call an element of L2(RdN) a state function of the system.
 

108
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Remark 2.10. In many of physics literatures, a state function is usually
called a “wave function”, although there are exceptions (e.g., [Margenau
and Murphy (1943); Tomonaga (1952)]). But it seems that the name “wave
function” may be misleading in understanding properly the essence of quan-
tum mechanical state, because, in the context of quantum mechanics, an
element ψ in L2(RdN) cannot be interpreted as representing any physical
wave such as an electromagnetic wave. As is well known, in the Hilbert
space formalism of quantum mechanics due to von Neumann [von Neu-
mann (1932)], ψ is interpreted as a probability amplitude: for each Borel set
Bj ⊂Rd (j = 1, . . . , N), the integral
R
B1×···×BN |ψ(x)|2dx/∥ψ∥2 gives the
probability of the event that the jth particle is found in Bj, j = 1, . . . , N,
where Rd is interpreted as the position space of the quantum particles. The
following points also should be noted: (1) if N ≥2, RdN does not represent
the phyiscal (position) space Rd (d = 1, 2, 3) in which quantum particles are
supposed to exist; (2) in quantum mechanics, two state vectors ψ and αψ
(α ∈C, α ̸= 1) represent an identical quantum state, but, if ψ would rep-
resent a physical wave, then they would represent diﬀerent states, because
the amplitude of ψ is diﬀerent from that of αψ. To be rigorous in the sense
of natural-philosophical cognition, we do not use the word “wave function”
for a quantum mechanical state. Of course, from a purely mathematical
point of view, it does not matter which name is used.
For mathematical generality and usefulness for applications, we con-
sider a general measure space (X, Σ, µ) instead of (Rd, Bd, µd
L) (µd
L is the
Lebesgue measure on (Rd, Bd)). Let
XN := {x = (x1, . . . , xN)|xj ∈X, j = 1, . . . , N}
be the N-direct product of X. We denote by µN the N-product measure of
µ on XN. For each element ψ ∈L2(XN, dµN) and a permutation σ ∈SN,
one can deﬁne ψσ ∈L2(X, dµN) by
ψσ(x) := ψ(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(N)),
µN-a.e.x ∈XN.
Then the mapping uσ : L2(XN, dµN) →L2(XN, dµN) deﬁned by
uσψ := ψσ,
ψ ∈L2(XN, dµN)
is unitary. For all σ, τ ∈SN,
(uσuτψ)(x) = (uτψ)(x′
1, . . . , x′
N)
(x′
j := xσ(j))
= ψ(x′
τ(1), . . . , x′
τ(N))
= ψ(xσ(τ(1)), . . . , xσ(τ(N)))
= ψ(x(στ)(1), . . . , x(στ)(N))
= (uστψ)(x).

109
Hence
uσuτ = uστ,
σ, τ ∈SN.
Hence, in particular,
u∗
σ = u−1
σ
= uσ−1.
Therefore the mapping ηN : SN →GL(L2(XN, dµN)) deﬁned by
ηN(σ) := uσ,
σ ∈SN
is a unitary representation of SN.
2.10.1
The Hilbert space of symmetric state functions
A state function ψ ∈L2(XN, dµN) is said to be symmetric if, for each
σ ∈SN,
ψ(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(N)) = ψ(x), µN-a.e.x ∈XN.
This is equivalent to that ψσ = ψ for all σ ∈SN.
We denote by
L2
sym(XN, dµN) the set of symmetric state functions in L2(XN, dµN):
L2
sym(XN, dµN) :=

ψ ∈L2(XN, dµN)|ψσ = ψ, σ ∈SN
	
.
Note that
L2
sym(XN, dµN) = ∩σ∈SN ker(uσ −1),
This implies that L2
sym(XN, dµN) is a closed subspace of L2(XN, dµN) and
hence a Hilbert space with the inner product of L2(XN, dµN). This Hilbert
space is used as a Hilbert space in the case where each quantum particle
under consideration is identical with a boson (i.e., a quantum particle with
an integer spin).2
We introduce a bounded linear operator
sN := 1
N!
X
σ∈SN
uσ
on L2(XN, dµN). It is obvious that
sNψ = ψ,
ψ ∈L2
sym(XN, dµN).
(2.58)
Lemma
2.9. The
operator
sN
is
the
orthogonal
projection
onto
L2
sym(XN, dµN).
2See Chapter 5, §5.1 for physical backgrounds.
 

110
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 2.9(ii), one can easily
show that sN is an orthogonal projection. Also we have
uσsN = sN,
σ ∈SN,
which imply that Ran(sN) ⊂L2
sym(XN, dµN). By this fact and (2.58), we
have Ran(sN) = L2
sym(XN, dµN).
We call sN the symmetrization operator on L2(XN, dµN).
Let UX,N : ⊗NL2(X, dµ) →L2(XN, dµN) be the natural isomorphism
(Theorem 2.5), i.e., it is a unitary operator such that
UX,N ⊗N
j=1 fj = f1 × · · · × fN,
fj ∈L2(X, dµ), j = 1, . . . , N.
Then an important fact is given in the following lemma:
Lemma 2.10. UX,NSN = sNUX,N.
Proof. For all fj ∈L2(X, dµ) (j = 1, . . . , N),
UX,NSN(⊗N
j=1fj) = 1
N!
X
σ∈SN
fσ(1) × · · · × fσ(N).
It is easy to see that
fσ(1) × · · · × fσ(N) = uσ−1(f1 × · · · × fN).
Hence
UX,NSN(⊗N
j=1fj) = sN(f1 × · · · × fN) = sNUX,N(⊗N
j=1fj).
Therefore UX,NSN = sNUX,N on ˆ⊗
NL2(X, dµ).
Since ˆ⊗
NL2(X, dµ) is
dense in ⊗NL2(X, dµ) and both UX,NSN and sNUX,N are bounded, the
operator equality UX,NSN = sNUX,N follows (apply Theorem 1.2).
We denote by U sym
X,N the restriction of UX,N to ⊗N
s L2(X, dµ). For all
fj ∈L2(X, dµ) (j = 1, . . . , N), we have
U sym
X,N(f1 · · · fN) = sN(f1 × · · · × fN).
(2.59)
The following fact holds:
Theorem 2.10. The symmetric tensor product ⊗N
s L2(X, dµ) is isomorphic
to L2
sym(XN, dµN) under U sym
X,N.
Proof. Lemma 2.10 implies that Ran(U sym
X,N) = L2
sym(XN, dµN).

Corollary 2.2. Let {fn}∞
n=1 be a CONS of L2(X, dµ) and Cj1···jN be given
by (2.49) (cf. Remark 2.6). Then

Cj1···jN sN(fj1 × · · · × fjN )
j1 ≤· · · ≤jN, ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N

U sym
X,N(Cj1···jN fj1 · · · fjN)
j1 ≤· · · ≤jN, ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N
o
is a CONS of L2
sym(XN, dµN). By this fact and (2.59), one obtains the
desired result.
2.10.2
The Hilbert space of anti-symmetric state functions
A state function ψ ∈L2(XN, dµN) is said to be anti-symmetric if, for
each σ ∈SN,
ψ(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(N)) = sgn(σ)ψ(x), µN-a.e.x ∈XN.
This is equivalent to that ψσ = sgn(σ)ψ for all σ ∈SN. We denote by
L2
as(XN, dµN) the set of anti-symmetric state functions in L2(XN, dµN):
L2
as(XN, dµN) :=

ψ ∈L2(XN, dµN) | ψσ = sgn(σ)ψ, σ ∈SN
	
.
We have
L2
as(XN, dµN) = ∩σ∈SN ker(uσ −sgn(σ)).
Hence L2
as(XN, dµN) is a closed subspace of L2(XN, dµN).
Therefore
L2
as(XN, dµN) is a Hilbert space with the inner product of L2(XN, dµN).
This Hilbert space is used as a Hilbert space in the case where each quan-
tum particle under consideration is identical with a fermion (i.e., a quantum
particle with a half-integer spin).3
The bounded linear operator
aN := 1
N!
X
σ∈SN
sgn(σ)uσ
on L2(XN, dµN) satisﬁes
aNψ = ψ,
ψ ∈L2
as(XN, dµN).
(2.60)
It is easy to see that
uσaN = sgn(σ)aN,
σ ∈SN.

the

Proof. Similar to the proof of Lemma 2.9.
We call aN the anti-symmetrization operator on L2(XN, dµN).
Lemma 2.12. UX,NAN = aNUX,N.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Lemma 2.10.
We denote by U as
X,N the restriction of UX,N to ∧N(L2(X, dµ)). For all
fj ∈L2(X, dµ) (j = 1, . . . , N), we have
U as
X,N(f1 ∧· · · ∧fN) =
√
N!aN(f1 × · · · × fN).

Theorem 2.11. The anti-symmetric tensor product ∧N(L2(X, dµ)) is iso-
morphic to L2
as(XN, dµN) under U as

Corollary 2.3. Let {fn}∞

2.11
Tensor Product of Direct Sum Hilbert Spaces
Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) and Kk (k = 1, . . . , M) be Hilbert spaces (N, M ∈
N). Then, for each pair (j, k), one has the tensor product Hilbert space
Hj ⊗Kk. Hence the direct sum of these Hilbert spaces exists. We denote
it by ⊕N
j=1 ⊕M
k=1 Hj ⊗Kk. Each element F in ⊕N
j=1 ⊕M
k=1 Hj ⊗Kk can be
represented as an N × M matrix F = (Fjk)j=1,...,N,k=1,...,M with the (j, k)
component Fjk being an element of Hj ⊗Kk.
Lemma 2.13. Let {e(j)
lj }Nj
lj=1 be a CONS of Hj (1 ≤Nj ≤∞) and
ee(j)
lj := (0, . . . , 0,
jth
e(j)
lj , 0, . . . , 0) ∈⊕N
j′=1Hj′
(j = 1, . . . , N, lj = 1, . . . , Nj).
Then {ee(j)
lj |j = 1, . . . , N, lj = 1, . . . , Nj} is a CONS of ⊕N
j=1Hj.
Proof. It is easy to see that {ee(j)
lj |j = 1, . . . , N, lj = 1, . . . , Nj} is an ONS
in ⊕N
j=1Hj. To prove its completeness, suppose that ψ ∈⊕N
j=1Hj satisﬁes
D
ψ, ee(j)
lj
E
= 0 for all j = 1, . . . , N and lj = 1, . . . , Nj. Then
D
ψj, e(j)
lj
E
= 0
for all lj = 1, . . . , Nj. Hence ψj = 0, j = 1, . . . , N. Therefore ψ = 0. Thus
the desired result follows.

Proof. (i) Let e(j)
lj

k=1 (1 ≤K ≤∞) be a
CONS of K . Then, for each j, {e(j)
lj ⊗fk|lj = 1, . . . , Nj, k = 1, . . . , K} is a
CONS of Hj ⊗K . Hence, by Lemma 2.13, the vectors
Φ(j)

form a CONS {Φ(j)
lj,k|j = 1, . . . , N, lj

⊕N
j=1Hj ⊗K .
By Lemma 2.13 again, {ee(j)
lj
⊗fk|j = 1, . . . , N, lj = 1, . . . , Nj, k =

Uee(j)
lj ⊗fk = Φ(j)
lj,k,
j = 1, . . . , N, lj = 1, . . . , Nj, k = 1, . . . , K.

Thus (2.62) holds.
(ii) We write the isomorphism in (i) as

Notes
As a natural extension of the concept of tensor product of ﬁnitely many
Hilbert spaces, there is a concept of inﬁnite tensor product Hilbert space
⊗∞
n=1Hn constructed from a sequence {Hn}∞
n=1 of Hilbert spaces. It is a
non-trivial task to deﬁne it rigorously, however. For the details, see the
original paper [von Neumann (1939)].
A use of inﬁnite tensor product
Hilbert space in quantum mathematical physics is found, e.g., in [Thirring
and Wehrl (1967)]. But, nowadays, inﬁnite tensor product Hilbert spaces
are not so often used, at least in the ﬁeld of quantum mathematical physics.

Problems
In the problems below, H , K , Hj and Kj (j ∈N) are Hilbert spaces.
(1) Let V be a complex vector space with a positive semi-deﬁnite inner
product ⟨, ⟩.
(i) Prove that the subset V0 := {u ∈V | ⟨u, u⟩= 0} is a subspace of
V .
◮Hint. For any positive semi-deﬁnite inner product, the Schwarz in-
equality holds: | ⟨u, v⟩| ≤
p
⟨u, u⟩
p
⟨v, v⟩, u, v ∈V .
(ii) For two vectors u, v ∈V , deﬁne the relation u ∼v by u −v ∈V0.
Prove that this relation ∼is an equivalence relation.

(iii) For each u ∈V , denote its equivalence class by [u]: [u] := {v ∈
V |v ∼u} and let V /V0 := {[u]|u ∈V } (the quotient space
of V by V0). Prove that V /V0 is a complex vector space with
the following addition and scalar multiplication: [u] + [v] := [u +
v], α[u] = [αu], u, v ∈V , α ∈C.
(iv) For [u], [v] ∈V /V0, deﬁne ⟨[u], [v]⟩:= ⟨u, v⟩. Prove that this is
well deﬁned (i.e., it is independent of the choice of elements from
[u] and [v]) and yields an inner product of V /V0.
(2) Prove that (H1 ⊗H2) ⊗H3 ∼= H1 ⊗H2 ⊗H3 with correspondence
(Ψ1 ⊗Ψ2) ⊗Ψ3 7→Ψ1 ⊗Ψ2 ⊗Ψ3 (Ψi ∈Hi, i = 1, 2, 3)
(3) Prove that, for all n ≥3, (⊗n−1

dence (⊗n−1

i=1Ψn (Ψi ∈Hi, i = 1, . . . , n).
(4) Let {Ψ1, . . . , Ψn} ⊂H1 be linearly independent and suppose that
{Φ1, . . . , Φn} ⊂H2 satisﬁes Pn
j=1 Ψj ⊗Φj = 0.
Then show that
Φj = 0, j = 1, . . . , n.
(5) Let (X, Σ, µ) be a measure space. Prove that the inner product space
L2(X, dµ; H ) is complete.
(6) Let m, n

For z = (z1, . . . , zm) ∈Cm and
w = (w1, . . . , wn) ∈Cn, we deﬁne z ◦w ∈Cmn by z ◦w :=
(zjwk)j=1,...,m,k=1,...,n. Prove that there exists a unique unitary trans-
formation Umn : Cm ⊗Cn →Cmn such that Umn(z ⊗w) = z ◦w, z ∈
Cm, w ∈Cn.
Remark.
This problem shows that Cm ⊗Cn is isomorphic to Cmn under
the unitary transformation Umn. This isomorphism is called the natural
isomorphism between Cm ⊗Cn and Cmn. In this sense, one writes Cm ⊗
Cn ∼= Cmn.
(7) Let Z := {0, ±1, ±2, . . .} be the set of integers and S be an inﬁnite
subset of Z (e.g., S = Z, N, {0} ∪N) and
ℓ2(S) :=

a = {an}n∈S|an ∈C, n ∈S,
X

.
As in the case of ℓ2 = ℓ2(N), the set ℓ2(S) becomes a Hilbert space

Remark. This problem shows that ⊗Nℓ2(S) is isomorphic to ℓ2(SN) under the
unitary transformation US. This isomorphism, written as ⊗Nℓ2(S) ∼= ℓ2(SN),
is called the natural isomorphism between ⊗Nℓ2(S) and ℓ2(SN).

Chapter 3
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
For each set (A1, . . . , AN) of densely deﬁned closable linear operators Aj (j =
1, . . . , N) acting in a Hilbert space Hj respectively, a linear operator ⊗N
j=1Aj,
called the tensor product operator (or tensor product) of Aj’s, is deﬁned. Fun-
damental properties of tensor product operators are proven. In particular, de-
tailed analyses are made on tensor products of self-adjoint operators, which play
important roles in applications to theory of many-body quantum systems.
3.1
Algebraic Tensor Product of Linear Operators
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces, and A and B be linear operators on
H and K with domain D(A) and D(B) respectively. Then the algebraic
tensor product D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) is a natural subspace of the tensor product
Hilbert space H ⊗K associated with the pair (A, B). The following fact
is harmonious:
Lemma 3.1. There exists a unique linear operator Aˆ⊗B on H ⊗K with
D(Aˆ⊗B) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) such that
Aˆ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ) = AΨ ⊗BΦ,
Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B).
(3.1)
Proof. Existence. Let F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗D(B). Then there exist an n ∈N and
vectors Ψi ∈D(A), Φi ∈D(B) (i = 1, . . . , n) such that
F =
n
X
i=1
Ψi ⊗Φi.
(3.2)
We may deﬁne a mapping Aˆ⊗B : D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) →H ⊗K by
Aˆ⊗B(F) :=
n
X
i=1
AΨi ⊗BΦi.

To show that this is well-deﬁned, we have to prove that the right hand side
of (3.3) is independent of ways of representing F as in (3.2). So let
F =
m
X
j=1
Ψ′

j
(3.4)
be another representation of F with some m ∈N, Ψ′
j
∈D(A) and
Φ′
j ∈D(B) (j = 1, . . . , m). Then the subspaces MA := span {Ψi, Ψ′
j|i =
1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m} and MB := span {Φi, Φ′
j|i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m}
are ﬁnite dimensional. Let dA := dim MA and dB := dim MB, and {ηk}dA
k=1
and {θl}dB
l=1 be orthonormal bases of MA and MB, respectively. Then we
have the following expansions:
Ψi =

with cki := ⟨ηk, Ψi⟩, c′
kj :=

ηk, Ψ′
j

, dli := ⟨θl, Φi⟩and d′
lj :=

θl, Φ′

. It
follows from (3.2) and (3.4) that
dA

aklηk ⊗θl =

X
l=1

where akl := Pn
i=1 ckidli and a′
kl := Pm
j=1 c′

lj. Hence akl = a′
kl for all
k = 1, . . . , dA and l = 1, . . . , dB. Therefore

Thus Aˆ⊗B is well-deﬁned. It is easy to see that Aˆ⊗B is linear and (3.1)
holds.
Uniqueness. Suppose that there exists a linear operator T on H ⊗K
with D(T ) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) such that T (Ψ⊗Φ) = AΨ⊗BΦ, Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈
D(B). Then T (Ψ ⊗Φ) = Aˆ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ), Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B). It follows
from the linearity of T and Aˆ⊗B that, for all F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗D(B), T (F) =
Aˆ⊗B(F). Thus T = Aˆ⊗B.
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
119
We call the operator Aˆ⊗B the algebraic tensor product of A and B.
Remark 3.1. Let H ′ and K ′ be Hilbert spaces and A (resp. B) be a
linear operator from H (resp. K ) to H ′ (resp. K ′). Then, in quite
the same manner as above, one can prove that there exists a unique linear
operator Ab⊗B from H ⊗K to H ′ ⊗K ′ with D(Ab⊗B) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B)
such that, for all Ψ ∈D(A) and Φ ∈D(B), Ab⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ) = AΨ ⊗BΦ.
The operator Ab⊗B also is called the algebraic tensor product of A and
B. This concept of algebraic tensor product of two linear operators is more
general.
3.2
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
Let A ∈L(H ) and B ∈L(K ).
Lemma 3.2. Suppose that A and B are densely deﬁned and closable. Then
Aˆ⊗B is densely deﬁned and closable. Moreover,
A∗ˆ⊗B∗⊂(Aˆ⊗B)∗,
(3.5)
Aˆ⊗B = Aˆ⊗B.
(3.6)
Proof. It is obvious that Aˆ⊗B is densely deﬁned.
Hence the adjoint
(Aˆ⊗B)∗exists. It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B), Ψ′ ∈
D(A∗) and Φ′ ∈D(B∗),
⟨Ψ′ ⊗Φ′, AΨ ⊗BΦ⟩= ⟨A∗Ψ′ ⊗B∗Φ′, Ψ ⊗Φ⟩.
Hence it follows that, for all F ∈D(Aˆ⊗B) and G ∈D(A∗ˆ⊗B∗),

G, Aˆ⊗B(F)

=

A∗ˆ⊗B∗G, F

.
This implies that G ∈D((Aˆ⊗B)∗) and (Aˆ⊗B)∗G = A∗ˆ⊗B∗G. Hence (3.5)
holds.
By Proposition 1.5, D(A∗) and D(B∗) are dense. Hence D(A∗ˆ⊗B∗) is
dense. Therefore, by (3.5), D((Aˆ⊗B)∗) is dense. Thus, by Proposition 1.5
again, Aˆ⊗B is closable. It is obvious that
Aˆ⊗B ⊂Aˆ⊗B.
Hence, by (1.3),
Aˆ⊗B ⊂Aˆ⊗B.
(3.7)
To prove the converse relation, let F ∈D(Aˆ⊗B). Then F is written as F =
P
i Ψi⊗Φi with Ψi ∈D(A) and Φi ∈D(B) (the sum is over a ﬁnite number
of terms). By the deﬁnition of operator closure, there exist vectors Ψi,n ∈
 

120
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
D(A), Φi,n ∈D(B) (n ∈N) such that Ψi,n →Ψi, Φi,n →Φi, AΨi,n →AΨi
and BΦi,n →BΦi as n →∞. Hence, letting Fn := P
i Ψi,n ⊗Φi,n, we
have that Fn ∈D(Aˆ⊗B), Fn →F and Aˆ⊗BFn →Aˆ⊗BF as n →∞. This
means that F ∈D(Aˆ⊗B) and Aˆ⊗BF = Aˆ⊗BF. Hence Aˆ⊗B ⊂Aˆ⊗B. By
this relation and (1.3), we obtain the converse relation of (3.7). Thus (3.6)
holds.
By Lemma 3.2, the following deﬁnition is possible:
Deﬁnition 3.1. For densely deﬁned closable operators A and B on H and
K respectively, the closed operator
A ⊗B := Aˆ⊗B
(3.8)
on H ⊗K is called the tensor product operator (or the tensor prod-
uct ) of A and B.
Remark 3.2. Also in the case where A (resp.
B) is a densely deﬁned
closable operator from H to a Hilbert space H ′ (resp. K ′), A ⊗B is
deﬁned by (3.8) as a closed operator from H ⊗K to H ′⊗K ′ (see Remark
3.1).
Let A ∈L(H ) and B ∈L(K ) be densely deﬁned and closable. Then,
by Lemma 3.2, we have
A ⊗B = A ⊗B.
(3.9)
It is easy to see that, for all α ∈C \ {0},
α(A ⊗B) = (αA) ⊗B = A ⊗(αB).
It follows from the deﬁnition of A ⊗B that D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) is a core for
A ⊗B. The next proposition formulates basic facts on A ⊗B.
Proposition 3.1. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K respectively. Then:
(i) If D ⊂D(A) and F ⊂D(B) are cores for A and B respectively, then
D ˆ⊗F is a core for A ⊗B.
(ii) A∗⊗B∗⊂(A ⊗B)∗.
(iii) If A and B are symmetric, then A ⊗B is symmetric.
Proof. (i) Let T := (A ⊗B) ↾D ˆ⊗F. Then it is obvious that T ⊂A ⊗B.
Hence T ⊂A ⊗B.
To prove the converse relation, let Ψ ∈D(A) and
Φ ∈D(B). Then there exist sequences {Ψn}∞
n=1 with Ψn ∈D and {Φn}∞
n=1
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
121
with Φn ∈F such that Ψn →Ψ, AΨn →AΨ, Φn →Φ and BΦn →BΦ
as n →∞. Hence Ψn ⊗Φn →Ψ ⊗Φ and T (Ψn ⊗Φn) →Aˆ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ)
as n →∞. This means that Aˆ⊗B ⊂T. Hence A ⊗B ⊂T. Therefore
T = A ⊗B.
(ii) Taking the closure operation on (3.5), we have A∗⊗B∗⊂(Aˆ⊗B)∗.
By Proposition 1.5(ii), (Aˆ⊗B)∗=

Aˆ⊗B
∗
= (A ⊗B)∗, Hence A∗⊗B∗⊂
(A ⊗B)∗.
(iii) Since A ⊂A∗and B ⊂B∗, it follows that Aˆ⊗B ⊂A∗ˆ⊗B∗. Hence,
taking the closure operation, we have A ⊗B ⊂A∗⊗B∗. Using part (ii),
we obtain A ⊗B ⊂(A ⊗B)∗. Thus A ⊗B is symmetric.
Remark 3.3. In Proposition 3.1(ii), the equality holds in fact: A∗⊗B∗=
(A⊗B)∗. For a proof of this fact, see, e.g., [Schm¨udgen (2012), Proposition
7.26].
In applications, operators of the form A⊗I +I ⊗B with A and B being
densely deﬁned closable operators are also fundamental.
Proposition 3.2. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K respectively. Then:
(i) A ⊗I + I ⊗B is desely deﬁned, closable and A∗⊗I + I ⊗B∗⊂
(A ⊗I + I ⊗B)∗.
(ii) If D ⊂D(A) and F ⊂D(B) are cores for A and B respectively, then
D ˆ⊗F is a core for (A ⊗I + I ⊗B) ↾D(A)ˆ⊗D(B). In particular,
(A ⊗I + I ⊗B) ↾D(A)ˆ⊗D(B)
= (A ⊗I + I ⊗B) ↾D(A)ˆ⊗D(B).
(3.10)
(iii) If A and B are symmetric, then A ⊗I + I ⊗B is symmetric.
Proof. For notational simplicity, we set S := A ⊗I + I ⊗B.
(i) It is obvious that D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) ⊂D(S). Hence S is densely deﬁned
and S∗⊃(A ⊗I)∗+ (I ⊗B)∗⊃A∗⊗I + I ⊗B∗. Hence D(S∗) is dense.
Thus S is closable.
(ii) Let S0 := S ↾D ˆ⊗F and S1 := S ↾D(A)ˆ⊗D(B). Then S0 ⊂S1 ⊂
S ⊂S. Hence S0 is closable and S0 ⊂S1. In the same way as in the
proof of Proposition 3.1(i), one can show that S1 ⊂S0. Hence S1 ⊂S0.
Thus S0 = S1. Formula (3.10) follows from an application of the preceding
result to the case where A and B are replaced by A and B respectively and
D = D(A), F = D(B).
(iii) This follows from (i).
 

122
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We conclude this section with a theorem on unitary equivalence of tensor
product operators.
Theorem 3.1. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K respectively. Let U : H ⊗K →K ⊗H be the natural isomorphism
(see Proposition 2.3), i.e., U is the unitary transformation from H ⊗K
to K ⊗H such that, for all Ψ ∈H and Φ ∈K , U(Ψ ⊗Φ) = Φ ⊗Ψ.
Then
U(A ⊗B)U −1 = B ⊗A.
(3.11)
Proof. It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(A) and Φ ∈D(B),
U(A ⊗B)U −1Φ ⊗Ψ = (B ⊗A)Φ ⊗Ψ.
Hence U(A ⊗B)U −1 = B ⊗A on D(B)ˆ⊗D(A). This fact and a simple
limiting argument give that U(A⊗B)U −1 ⊂B ⊗A. By symmetry, we have
U −1(B ⊗A)U ⊂A ⊗B, which implies that B ⊗A ⊂U(A ⊗B)U −1. Thus
(3.11) holds.
Formula (3.11) shows that A ⊗B is unitarily equivalent to B ⊗A under
the natural isomorphism U. This is a nice property. For example, spectral
properties of B ⊗A are same as those of A ⊗B. Moreover, (3.11) makes it
possible to derive properties of B ⊗A from those of A ⊗B.
3.3
Tensor Product of Bounded Linear Operators
In this section, as a basic step for analysis of tensor product operators, we
consider tensor products of bounded linear operators
For a Hilbert space X , we denote the identity on X by IX (or simply
I if there would be no danger of confusion).
Theorem 3.2. Let A ∈B(H ) and B ∈B(K ).
(i) A ⊗I and I ⊗B are in B(H ⊗K ) with
∥A ⊗I∥= ∥A∥,
∥I ⊗B∥= ∥B∥.
(3.12)
(ii) A ⊗B ∈B(H ⊗K ) and
A ⊗B = (A ⊗I)(I ⊗B) = (I ⊗B)(A ⊗I).
(3.13)
In particular, A ⊗I and I ⊗B commute.
Moreover,
∥A ⊗B∥= ∥A∥∥B∥.
(3.14)
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
123
(iii) For all C ∈B(H ) and D ∈B(K ),
(A ⊗B)(C ⊗D) = (AC) ⊗(BD),
(3.15)
(A + C) ⊗(B + D) = A ⊗B + A ⊗D + C ⊗B
+ C ⊗D.
(3.16)
(iv) A∗⊗B∗= (A ⊗B)∗.
(v) If A and B are self-adjoint, then A ⊗B and A ⊗I + I ⊗B are self-
adjoint.
(vi) If A and B are unitary, then A ⊗B is unitary.
(vii) If A and B are orthogonal projections, A ⊗B is an orthogonal pro-
jection and Ran(A ⊗B) = Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B).
Proof. (i) Let F ∈H ˆ⊗K . Then, by Lemma 2.1, F is written as F =
PM
l=1 Ψl ⊗fl (see (2.11)) with Ψl ∈H and {fl}l being an ONS of K .
Hence
∥(Aˆ⊗I)F∥2 =

∥Ψl∥2 = ∥A∥2∥F∥2.
Hence Aˆ⊗I is bounded with ∥Aˆ⊗I∥≤∥A∥.
Since H ˆ⊗K is dense in
H ⊗K , A ⊗I is in B(H ⊗K ) with ∥A ⊗I∥≤∥A∥.
There exists a sequence {Θn}∞
n=1 of unit vectors Θn ∈H such that
∥AΘn∥→∥A∥as n →∞. Then, for all unit vectors Φ ∈K ,
∥AΘn∥= ∥A ⊗I(Θn ⊗Φ)∥≤∥A ⊗I∥∥Θn ⊗Φ∥= ∥A ⊗I∥.
Hence, taking n →∞, we obtain ∥A∥≤∥A⊗I∥. Thus the ﬁrst equation of
(3.12) holds. The statements for I⊗B are similarly proved (or use Theorem
3.1).
(ii) It is easy to see that, for all F ∈H ˆ⊗K , A⊗B(F) = (A⊗I)(I⊗B)F.
Hence A ⊗B ↾H ˆ⊗K ⊂(A ⊗I)(I ⊗B). Therefore A ⊗B is bounded and
A ⊗B = (A ⊗I)(I ⊗B). Similarly we have A ⊗B = (I ⊗B)(A ⊗I).
By part (i), we have ∥A⊗B∥≤∥A⊗I∥∥I ⊗B∥= ∥A∥∥B∥. Let us prove
the converse inequality. By the deﬁnition of operator norm, for any ε > 0,
there exist unit vectors Ψ ∈H and Φ ∈K satisfying ∥AΨ∥> ∥A∥−ε
and ∥BΦ∥> ∥B∥−ε. We have
∥A ⊗B∥≥∥A ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ)∥= ∥AΨ∥∥BΦ∥.
Hence
∥A ⊗B∥> (∥A∥−ε)(∥B∥−ε).

Taking ε →0, we obtain ∥A ⊗B∥≥∥A∥∥B∥. Thus (3.14) holds.
(iii) For all F ∈H ˆ⊗K , (A ⊗B)(C ⊗D)F = (AC) ⊗(BD)F. Since
(A ⊗B)(C ⊗D) and (AC) ⊗(BD) are bounded, (3.15) follows. Similarly
(3.16) can be proved.
(iv) This follows from Proposition 3.1(ii) and the fact that A∗⊗B∗∈
B(H ⊗K ) in the present case.
(v) If A ∈B(H ) and B ∈B(K ) are self-adjoint, then A∗= A and
B∗= B. Hence, by part (iv), A ⊗B = (A ⊗B)∗. Hence A ⊗B is self-
adjoint. In particular, A⊗I and I ⊗B are self-adjoint and bounded. Hence
A ⊗I + I ⊗B is also a bounded self-adjoint operator.
(vi) By the present assumption, A∗A = AA∗= I and B∗B = BB∗= I.
Hence, by (iv) and (iii),
(A⊗B)∗(A⊗B) = A∗A⊗B∗B = I,
(A⊗B)(A⊗B)∗= AA∗⊗BB∗= I.
This means that A ⊗B is unitary.
(vii) The self-adjointness of A ⊗B follows from (v). By (3.15), (A ⊗
B)2 = A2 ⊗B2 = A ⊗B. Hence A ⊗B is an orthogonal projection. It
is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B), (A ⊗B)Ψ = Ψ. Hence
Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B) ⊂Ran(A ⊗B). Taking the closure of the both sides, we
obtain Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B) ⊂Ran(A ⊗B). Conversely, let Ψ ∈Ran(A ⊗B).
Then (A⊗B)Ψ = Ψ. There exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in H b⊗K such that
Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). The vector Φn := (A⊗B)Ψn is in Ran(A)⊗Ran(B) and
Φn →(A ⊗B)Ψ = Ψ. Hence Ψ ∈Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B). Hence Ran(A ⊗B) ⊂
Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B). Thus Ran(A ⊗B) = Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B).
The next proposition is concerned with convergence properties of se-
quences of tensor product operators.
Proposition 3.3. Let An, A ∈B(H ) and Bn, B ∈B(K ) (n ∈N).
(i) If u- limn→∞An = A and u- limn→∞Bn = B, then u- limn→∞An ⊗
Bn = A ⊗B.
(ii) If s-limn→∞An = A and s- limn→∞Bn = B, then s- limn→∞An ⊗
Bn = A ⊗B.
(iii) If w-limn→∞An = A and w- limn→∞Bn = B, then w- limn→∞An ⊗
Bn = A ⊗B.
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators

Proof. (i) This is proved as follows:
∥An ⊗Bn −A ⊗B∥= ∥(An −A) ⊗Bn + A ⊗(Bn −B)∥
≤∥(An −A) ⊗Bn∥+ ∥A ⊗(Bn −B)∥
= ∥An −A∥∥Bn∥+ ∥A∥∥Bn −B∥
(by (3.14))
→0
(n →∞).
(ii) For all Ψ ∈H and Φ ∈K , limn→∞AnΨ = AΨ and limn→∞BnΦ =
BΦ. Hence, by Proposition 2.1(i), limn→∞An⊗Bn(Ψ⊗Φ) = A⊗B(Ψ⊗Φ).
This implies that, for all F ∈H ˆ⊗K , limn→∞An ⊗Bn(F) = A ⊗B(F).
By Proposition 1.8, a := supn∈N ∥An∥< ∞and b := supn∈N ∥Bn∥< ∞.
Hence supn∈N ∥An ⊗Bn∥≤ab. Hence, by an application of Proposition
A.3 in Appendix A, we obtain s- limn→∞An ⊗Bn = A ⊗B.
(iii) In the same way as in (ii), we can show that, for all F, G ∈H ˆ⊗K ,
limn→∞⟨F, An ⊗Bn(G)⟩= ⟨F, A ⊗B(G)⟩.
By Proposition 1.8, ∥An ⊗
Bn∥= ∥An∥∥Bn∥≤ab, n ∈N. Hence, by Proposition A.2 in Appendix A,
the desired result is obtained.
3.4
Reduction of Tensor Product Operators
In this section we prove some basic facts on reductions of tensor product
operators (see Section 1.9 for the concept of reduction of a linear operator).
Proposition 3.4. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on
H and K respectively. Suppose that A (resp. B) is reduced by a closed
subspace M ⊂H (resp. N ⊂K ).
(i) The operator A ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N and
(A ⊗B)M⊗N = AM ⊗BN .
(3.17)
(ii) The operator A ⊗I + I ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N and
(A ⊗I + I ⊗B)M⊗N = AM ⊗IN + IM ⊗BN .
(3.18)
Proof. Let P (resp. Q) be the orthogonal projection onto M (resp. N ).
Then, by the assumption, PA ⊂AP · · · (∗) and QB ⊂BQ · · · (∗∗). By
Theorem 3.2(vii), the orthogonal projection onto M ⊗N is P ⊗Q.
(i) Let Ψ ∈D(A ⊗B).
Then there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in
D(A)b⊗D(B) such that Ψn →Ψ and (A⊗B)Ψn →(A⊗B)Ψ (n →∞). By
(∗) and (∗∗) mentioned above, we have (P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψn = (A ⊗B)(P ⊗
Q)Ψn. Hence (A ⊗B)(P ⊗Q)Ψn →(P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψ (n →∞). Also
 

126
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(P ⊗Q)Ψn →(P ⊗Q)Ψ (n →∞). Since A ⊗B is closed, it follows that
(P ⊗Q)Ψ ∈D(A ⊗B) and (A ⊗B)(P ⊗Q)Ψ = (P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψ. Hence
(A ⊗B)(P ⊗Q) ⊂(P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B). Thus A ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N .
It is obvious that (A ⊗B)M⊗N = AM ⊗BN on D(AM )b⊗D(BN ).
Hence it follows that AM ⊗BM ⊂(A ⊗B)M⊗N .
Conversely, let Ψ ∈D((A ⊗B)M⊗N ). Then there exists a sequence
{Φn}∞
n=1 in D(Ab⊗B) such that Φn →Ψ and (A⊗B)Φn →(A⊗B)Ψ (n →
∞). Hence, putting Ψn := (P ⊗Q)Φn, we have Ψn ∈D(AM )b⊗D(BN )
and limn→∞Ψn = (P ⊗Q)Ψ = Ψ. Moreover, (AM ⊗BN )Ψn = (P ⊗
Q)(A ⊗B)Φn →(P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψ = (A ⊗B)M⊗N Ψ (n →∞). Hence
Ψ ∈D(AM ⊗BN ) and (AM ⊗BN )Ψ = (A ⊗B)M⊗N Ψ. Thus (3.17)
holds.
(ii) By a simple application of (i), A ⊗I and I ⊗B are reduced by
M ⊗N with (A ⊗I)M⊗N = AM ⊗IN and (I ⊗B)M⊗N = IM ⊗BN .
Hence, by Proposition 1.41, A ⊗I + I ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N . Hence,
by Theorem 1.38(v), A ⊗I + I ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N and
 A ⊗I + I ⊗B

M⊗N = (A ⊗I + I ⊗B)M⊗N .
By Proposition 1.41 and the above mentioned facts, one obtains (3.18).
3.5
Basic Properties of Simple Tensor Product Operators
Let A be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then the correspon-
dence: A 7→A ⊗I gives an extension of A to a closed operator on H ⊗K .
We show that some properties of A are preserved under this extension.
3.5.1
Some estimates
Proposition 3.5. Let A be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
(i) Suppose that there exists a constant c > 0 such that
∥AΨ∥≥c∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(A).
Then
∥A ⊗I(F)∥≥c∥F∥,
F ∈D(A ⊗I).
(3.19)
(ii) If A is symmetric and A ≥γ with a constant γ ∈R, then A ⊗I is
symmetric and A ⊗I ≥γ.
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
127
Proof. (i) Let F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗K . Then F is written as in (2.11) with Ψl ∈
D(A) and {fl}l is an ONS of K . Hence
∥A ⊗I(F)∥2 =
M
X
l=1
∥AΨl∥2 ≥c2
M
X
l=1
∥Ψl∥2 = c2∥F∥2.
Since D(A)ˆ⊗K is a core for A ⊗I, we can apply Proposition 1.12 to the
case where T = A ⊗I, S = cI, a = 1 and b = 0 to obtain (3.19).
(ii) The symmetry of A ⊗I follows from Proposition 3.1(iii). Let F be
as in the proof of (i). Then
⟨F, A ⊗I(F)⟩=
M
X
l=1
⟨Ψl, AΨl⟩≥γ
M
X
l=1
∥Ψl∥2 = γ∥F∥2.
A limiting argument similar to that in the proof of Proposition 1.12 gives
⟨F, A ⊗I(F)⟩≥γ∥F∥2, F ∈D(A ⊗I). Thus A ⊗I ≥γ.
The next proposition is fundamental for perturbation theories of linear
operators on tensor product Hilbert spaces.
Proposition 3.6. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on
H .
(i) Suppose that B is A-bounded, i.e., D(A) ⊂D(B) and there exist con-
stants a, b ≥0 such that
∥BΨ∥≤a∥AΨ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(A).
Then D(A ⊗I) ⊂D(B ⊗I) and
∥B ⊗I(F)∥≤a∥A ⊗I(F)∥+ b∥F∥,
F ∈D(A ⊗I).
(3.20)
(ii) Suppose that D(A) ⊂D(B) and there exist constants a, b ≥0 such that
∥BΨ∥2 ≤a2∥AΨ∥2 + b2∥Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈D(A).
Then D(A ⊗I) ⊂D(B ⊗I) and
∥B ⊗I(F)∥2 ≤a2∥A ⊗I(F)∥2 + b2∥F∥2,
F ∈D(A ⊗I).
(3.21)

(by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality)
= a∥B ⊗I(F)∥∥A ⊗I(F)∥+ b∥B ⊗I(F)∥∥F∥.
Hence (3.20) holds for all F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗K . Since D(A)ˆ⊗K is a core for
A ⊗I, a simple application of Proposition 1.12 gives (3.20).
(ii) Let F be as in the proof of (i). Then
∥B ⊗I(F)∥2 =

Hence (3.21) follows from a limiting argument similar to that in the proof
of Proposition 1.12.
3.5.2
Spectral properties of A ⊗I
In what follows, we take it for granted that H ̸= {0} and K ̸= {0}.
Lemma 3.3. Let A be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H .
(i)
ker A ⊗I = ker A ⊗K .
(3.22)
(ii) A is injective if and only if A ⊗I is injective.
(iii) Ran(A) is dense in H if and only if Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K .
(iv) A is bijective if and only if A ⊗I is bijective. In that case,
(A ⊗I)−1 = A−1 ⊗I.
(3.23)
Proof. (i) By the decomposition theorem with respect to A (Theorem
1.8(ii)), we have H = ker A ⊕Ran A∗. Hence
H ⊗K = (ker A ⊗K ) ⊕(Ran A∗⊗K ).
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
129
For all Ψ ∈ker A ⊗I, ψ ∈D(A∗) and φ ∈K , we have
0 = ⟨(A ⊗I)Ψ, ψ ⊗φ⟩= ⟨Ψ, A∗ψ ⊗φ⟩.
Hence Ψ ∈(Ran A∗ˆ⊗K )⊥, which implies that Ψ ∈(Ran A∗⊗K )⊥. Hence
ker A ⊗I ⊂ker A ⊗K . For each Ψ ∈ker A ⊗K , there exists a sequence
{Ψn}n in ker Aˆ⊗K such that Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). We have A ⊗IΨn = 0.
Hence, by the closedness of A ⊗I, Ψ ∈D(A ⊗I) and (A ⊗I)Ψ = 0.
Therefore ker A ⊗K ⊂ker A ⊗I. Thus (3.22) holds.
(ii) This follows from (i).
(iii) Suppose that Ran(A) is dense on H .
It is obvious that
Ran(A)ˆ⊗K
⊂
Ran(A ⊗I).
It follows from the assumption that
Ran(A)ˆ⊗K is dense in H ⊗K . Hence Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K .
Conversely assume that Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K . Suppose that
Ran(A) were not dense in H .
Since H = ker A∗⊕Ran(A) (Theorem
1.8(ii)), there exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈ker A∗. Then, for all φ ∈K and
Ψ ∈D(A ⊗I),
⟨ψ ⊗φ, (A ⊗I)Ψ⟩= ⟨A∗ψ ⊗φ, Ψ⟩= 0.
Hence Ran(A ⊗I) is not dense. But this is a contradiction. Thus Ran(A)
is dense in H .
(iv) Let A be bijective. Then, by (ii) and (iii), A ⊗I is injective and
Ran(A⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K . By the present assumption, A−1 is bounded
(this follows from the closed graph theorem). Hence
(A ⊗I)(A−1 ⊗I) = I,
(A−1 ⊗I)(A ⊗I) ⊂I.
This means that A ⊗I is bijective and (3.23) holds.
Conversely let A ⊗I be bijective. Then, by (ii) and (iii), A is injective
and Ran(A) is dense. We have for all ψ ∈D(A−1) and φ ∈K
A−1ψ ⊗φ = (A ⊗I)−1ψ ⊗φ.
Suppose that A−1 were not bounded. Then there exists a sequence {ψn}n
in D(A−1) such that ∥ψn∥= 1, n ∈N and ∥A−1ψn∥→∞(n →∞). Let
φ ∈K be a unit vector. Then, ∥ψn ⊗φ∥= 1 and, by the equation given
above, we have
∥(A ⊗I)−1ψn ⊗φ∥= ∥A−1ψn∥→∞(n →∞).
This shows that (A⊗I)−1 is unbounded. But this is a contradiction. Hence
A−1 is bounded. Since A is closed, it follows that Ran(A) = H .

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We can now identify the spectra of A ⊗I.
Theorem 3.3. Let A be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H . Then
σ(A ⊗I) = σ(A).
(3.24)
Proof. Equation (3.24) is equivalent to
ρ(A ⊗I) = ρ(A).
We prove this.
Let λ ∈ρ(A). Then the closed operator A −λ is bijective. Hence, by
Lemma 3.3(iv), (A −λ) ⊗I is bijective. It is easy to see that
A ⊗I −λ = (A −λ) ⊗I.
(3.25)
Hence A⊗I −λ is bijective. Therefore λ ∈ρ(A⊗I). Thus ρ(A) ⊂ρ(A⊗I).
Conversely, let λ ∈ρ(A ⊗I). Then (A −λ) ⊗I is bijective. Hence, by
Lemma 3.3(iv), A −λ is bijective. Therefore λ ∈ρ(A). Thus ρ(A ⊗I) ⊂
ρ(A).
Theorem 3.4. For all λ ∈C,
ker(A ⊗I −λ) = ker(A −λ) ⊗K .
(3.26)
In particular,
σp(A ⊗I) = σp(A)
(3.27)
and, for each λ ∈σp(A),
dim ker(A ⊗I −λ) = dim ker(A −λ) · dim K .
(3.28)
Proof. Equation (3.26) is just an application of Lemma 3.3(i) with A re-
placed by A −λ (use also (3.25)). Properties (3.27) and (3.28) follow from
(3.26).
Remark 3.4. Formula (3.28) shows that, if K is inﬁnite dimensional,
then the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ ∈σp(A ⊗I) is inﬁnite even if the
multiplicity of λ ∈σp(A) is ﬁnite.
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators

3.6
Eigenvalues of Tensor Product Operators
Proposition 3.7. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K respectively. Then
{λµ|λ ∈σp(A), µ ∈σp(B)} ⊂σp(A ⊗B).
(3.29)
{λ + µ|λ ∈σp(A), µ ∈σp(B)} ⊂σp(A ⊗I + I ⊗B).
(3.30)
Proof. Let λ ∈σp(A) and µ ∈σp(B). There exist non-zero vectors Ψ ∈
D(A) and Φ ∈D(B) such that AΨ = λΨ and BΦ = µΦ. Hence Ψ ⊗Φ ∈
D(A ⊗B) ∩D(A ⊗I + I ⊗B) and
A ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ) = λµ(Ψ ⊗Φ), (A ⊗I + I ⊗B)Ψ ⊗Φ = (λ + µ)Ψ ⊗Φ.
Since Ψ ⊗Φ is not zero, λµ ∈σp(A ⊗B) and λ + µ ∈σp(A ⊗I + I ⊗B).
Thus (3.29) and (3.30) hold.
3.7
Tensor Product of N Linear Operators with N ≥3
The concept of the tensor product of two linear operators can be easily
extended to the case of N linear operators. Let H1, . . . , HN be Hilbert
spaces and Aj be a densely deﬁned closable operator on Hj (j = 1, . . . , N).
Then, in the same way as in the case N = 2, one can show that there exists
a unique densely deﬁned closed operator ⊗N
j=1Aj on ⊗N
j=1Hj such that the
algebraic tensor product ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Aj) of D(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N) is a core for
⊗N
j=1Aj and
⊗N
j=1Aj(⊗N
j=1Ψj) = ⊗N
j=1AjΨj,
⊗N
j=1Ψj ∈ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Aj).
We call the operator ⊗N
j=1Aj the tensor product of A1, . . . , AN.
Propositions 3.1–3.7 and Theorem 3.2 can be extended to the case of
⊗N
j=1Aj. Since it is an easy exercise to write down and prove the extended
versions, we omit the details. Here we only prove the following proposition.
Generically we use symbol “0” to denote the zero-operator on a Hilbert
space.
Proposition 3.8. Let A1, . . . , AN be as above. Then ⊗N
j=1Aj ⊂0 if and
only if, for some j ∈{1, . . . , N}, Aj ⊂0.
Proof. Let ⊗N
j=1Aj ⊂0.
Then, for all ψj ∈D(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N),
⊗N
j=1Ajψj = 0. Hence 0 = ∥⊗N
j=1 Ajψj∥= QN
j=1 ∥Ajψj∥. Suppose that,
for each j = 1, . . . , N, Aj ̸⊂0. Then there exist vectors ψj ∈D(Aj) such
that Ajψj ̸= 0. Hence QN
j=1 ∥Aψj∥> 0. But this is a contradiction. Hence,
for some j, Aj ⊂0. The “if” part is obvious.
 

132
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Remark 3.5. Also in the case where each Aj is a densely deﬁned closable
operator from Hj to a Hilbert space Kj, the tensor product ⊗N
j=1Aj is
deﬁned, in exactly the same manner as above, as a densely deﬁned closed
operator from ⊗N
j=1Hj to ⊗N
j=1Kj (see Remarks 3.1 and 3.2).
3.8
Tensor Product of Self-adjoint Operators
We now consider tensor products of self-adjoint operators which play impor-
tant roles in applications to quantum physics. Let H1, . . . , HN be Hilbert
spaces and Aj be a self-adjoint operator on Hj (j = 1, . . . , N). We set
eAj := I ⊗· · · I⊗
jth
A j ⊗I · · · ⊗I
(3.31)
acting in ⊗N
k=1Hk. By Proposition 3.1(iii), eAj is a closed symmetric oper-
ator on ⊗N
k=1Hk.
Theorem 3.5. Let j = 1, . . . , N.
(i) Let Dk (k ̸= j) be a dense subspace of Hk and Dj be a core for Aj.
Then eAj is essentially self-adjoint on ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk. In particilar, eAj is
self-adjoint.
(ii) The spectral measure E e
Aj is given by
E e
Aj(B) = I ⊗· · · I⊗
jth
E Aj (B) ⊗I · · · ⊗I,
B ∈B1.
(3.32)
(iii) For all t ∈R and j = 1, . . . , N,
eit e
Aj = I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗
jth
eitAj ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I.
(iv) The N-tuple eA := ( eA1, . . . , eAN) of self-adjoint operators is strongly
commuting.
(v) Let nj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N. Then ( eAn1
1 , . . . , eAnN
N ) is a set of strongly
commuting self-adjoint operators with
f
Aj
nj = I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗Anj
j
⊗I · · · ⊗I, j = 1, . . . , N.
(3.33)
Proof. (i) By Proposition 1.19, Fj := (Aj + i)Dj is dense in Hj. Hence
G := D1 ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗
jth
Fj ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗DN
is dense in ⊗N
k=1Hk. Let Ψk ∈Dk (k ̸= j) and Φj ∈Fj. Then there exists
a vector Ψj ∈Dj such that (Aj + i)Ψj = Φj. Hence one has
( eAj + i)
 ⊗N
k=1Ψk

= Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗
jth
Φj ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN.
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
133
Hence ( eAj +i)(ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk) ⊃G . Hence ( eAj +i)(ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk) is dense in ⊗N
k=1Hk.
Similarly one can show that ( eAj −i)(ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk) is dense in ⊗N
k=1Hk. Hence,
by Proposition 1.19, eAj is essentially self-adjoint on ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk. Thus eAj is
self-adjoint.
(ii) Let
Ej(B) := I ⊗· · · I⊗
jth
E Aj (B) ⊗I · · · ⊗I,
B ∈B1.
Then, by Theorem 3.2(vii),1 Ej(B) is an orthogonal projection. It is obvi-
ous that Ej(R) = I and Ej(∅) = 0. Let Bl ∈B1 (l ∈N) with Bl ∩Bl′ = ∅
(l ̸= l′) and B := ∪∞
l=1Bl. Then s- limn→∞
Pn
l=1 EAj(Bl) = EAj(B). For
all n ∈N, ∥Pn
l=1 EAj(Bl)∥= ∥EAj(∪n
l=1Bl)∥≤1. Hence we can apply
Proposition 3.3(ii) to obtain s- limn→∞
Pn
l=1 Ej(Bl) = Ej(B). Thus Ej is
a one-dimensional spectral measure. Hence, by the functional calculus, the
operator
Tj :=
Z
R
λdEj(λ)

Hence eAjG = TjG, which implies that eAj ↾D ⊂Tj. Since D is a core for
eAj, it follows that eAj = Tj. Thus Ej = E e
Aj.
(iii) The operator
Xj := I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗

This implies that, for all F, G ∈ˆ⊗

Since eit e
Aj and Xj are bounded and ˆ⊗
N
j=1Hj is dense in ⊗N
j=1Hj, it follows
that eit e
Aj = Xj.
(iv) By Theorem 3.2(ii), E e
Aj and E e
Ak (j ̸= k) commute. Hence eA is
strongly commuting.
(v) By part (iv) and Theorem 1.28, eAnj
j
and eAnk
k are strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators. It is easy to see that
eAnj
j
⊃I ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗I ⊗Anj
j ˆ⊗I · · · ˆ⊗I.
Hence eAnj
j
⊃I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗Anj
j ⊗I · · · ⊗I. The operator on the right hand
side is self-adjoint. Thus operator equality (3.33) follows.
By Theorem 3.5, eA has the joint spectral measure E e
A. We denote it
by E⊗
A1,...,AN:
E⊗
A1,...,AN := E e
A.
(3.34)
It follows that
E⊗
A1,...,AN(J1 × · · · × JN) = ⊗N
j=1EAj(Jj),
Jj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , N. (3.35)
and
eAj =

A1,...,AN(λ).
(3.36)
An N-fold tensor product version of Theorem 3.3 yields the following
theorem:
Theorem 3.6. For all j = 1, . . . , N,
σ( e
Aj) = σ(Aj).
(3.37)

As for the joint spectrum σJ( eA), we have the following theorem:
Theorem 3.7.
σJ( eA) = σ(A1) × · · · × σ(AN).
(3.38)
Proof. By Theorem 3.6, we have
σ(A1) × · · · × σ(AN) = σ( eA1) × · · · × σ( e
AN).
Hence we need only to show that
σJ( eA) = σ( eA1) × · · · × σ( e
AN).
(3.39)
So we check the suﬃcient condition in Theorem 1.31. Let λ ∈σ( eA1)×· · ·×
σ( e
AN). Then, λj ∈σ(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N) and, for all ε > 0,
E e
A1((λ1 −ε, λ + ε)) · · · E e
AN((λN −ε, λN + ε)) = ⊗N
j=1EAj((λj −ε, λj + ε)).
Since each EAj((λj −ε, λj + ε)) is not zero, it follows from Proposition 3.8
that E e
A1((λ1 −ε, λ+ε)) · · · E e
AN ((λN −ε, λN +ε)) ̸= 0. Hence, by Theorem
1.31, (3.39) holds.
Now we are ready to investigate basic properties of tensor product op-
erators formed out of self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 3.8. Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj and
SA1,...,AN :=
N
X
j=1
eAj.
(3.40)
Then:
(i) SA1,...,AN is essentially self-adjoint and
σ(SA1,...,AN) =

(3.42)
(iii) If Dj is a core for Aj (j = 1, . . . , N), then ˆ⊗
N
j=1Dj is a core for
SA1,...,AN.

(iv) If Aj ≥γj with some γj ∈R (j = 1, . . . , N), then SA1,...,AN is self-
adjoint and bounded from below with SA1,...,AN ≥PN
j=1 γj.
(v) For all t ∈R,
eitSA1,...,AN = ⊗N
j=1eitAj.
(3.43)
Proof. (i) This follows from an application of Corollary 1.6(i) with Tj = eAj
and (3.38).
(ii) Since the function:RN ∋(λ1, . . . , λN) 7→PN
j=1 λj is real-valued and
continuous, the operator
T :=

RN




dE⊗
A1,...,AN(λ1, . . . , λN)
is self-adjoint. By (3.36), we have SA1,...,AN ⊂T . Hence SA1,...,AN ⊂T . By
(i), SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint. Since a self-adjoint operator has no non-trivial
symmetric extension, it follows that SA1,...,AN = T .
(iii) This follows from (i) and Proposition 3.1(i).
(iv) This follows from a simple application of Corollary 1.6(ii) with
Tj = eAj.
(v) By an application of Corollary 1.6(iii) with Tj = eAj, we have
eitSA1,...,AN = eit e
A1 · · · eit e
AN .
By Theorem 3.5(ii), the right hand side is equal to ⊗N
j=1eitAj.
In addition to the operator SA1,...,AN, the operators of the form ⊗N
j=1Anj
j
(nj ∈{0} ∪N, j = 1, . . . , N) play important roles in applications to quan-
tum physics.
Theorem 3.9. Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj and
nj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N. Then:
(i) ⊗N
j=1Anj

Tensor Product of Linear Operators

Proof. (i) By Theorem 1.13, Anj
j
is self-adjoint. Let D := ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Anj
j ).
Then D ⊂D( eAn1
1 · · · eAnN
N ) with
( eAn1
1 · · · eAnN
N ) ↾D = ˆ⊗
N
j=1Anj
j
and, for all R > 0, E e
Aj([−R, R])D ⊂D.
Hence, by Theorem 1.37,
eAn1
1 · · · eAnN
N
is essentially self-adjoint on D. Hence ⊗N
j=1Anj
j
= ˆ⊗
N
j=1Anj
j
is self-adjoint. It follows from Theorem 1.37 that
⊗N
j=1Anj
j
=

RN


N
Y
j=1
λnj
j

dE⊗
A1,...,AN(λ).
Hence (3.44) holds.
(ii) This follows from (i) and Proposition 3.1(i).
(iii) This follows from an application of Corollary 1.7(ii) or (3.44).
We also note the following fact:
Proposition 3.9. Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj.
Then ⊗N
j=1Aj is injective if and only if each Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) is injective.
In that casse, (⊗N
j=1Aj)−1 = ⊗N
j=1A−1
j .
Proof. Suppose that, for some l, Al is not injective. Then there is a non-
zero vector ψl ∈D(Al) such that Alψl = 0. Hence, for all ψj ∈D(Aj)\{0}
(j ̸= l), Ψ := ⊗N
j=1ψj is a non-zero vector in D(⊗N
j=1Aj) and (⊗N
j=1Aj)Ψ =
0. Hence ker⊗N
j=1Aj ̸= {0}. Thus ⊗N
j=1Aj is not injective.
Conversely, suppose that each Aj is injectve. Let Φ ∈ker(⊗N
j=1Aj).
Then (⊗N
j=1Aj)Φ = 0.
Hence, for all ψj ∈D(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N),

⊗N
j=1ψj, (⊗N
j=1Aj)Φ

= 0, which implies that

⊗N
j=1Ajψj, Φ

= 0. Hence
Φ is orthogonal to ˆ⊗
N
j=1Ran(Aj).
By the injectivity of Aj, Ran(Aj) is
dense.
Hence ˆ⊗
N
j=1Ran(Aj) is dense.
Therefore Φ = 0, implying that
ker(⊗N
j=1Aj) = {0}. Thus ⊗N
j=1Aj is injective.
By Theorem 3.9(i), ⊗N
j=1Aj is self-adjoint and hence R := (⊗N
j=1Aj)−1
is self-adjoint. It is easy to see that R ⊃ˆ⊗
N
j=1A−1
j . Hence R ⊃⊗N
j=1A−1
j .
By Theorem 3.9(i) again, the operator ⊗N
j=1A−1
j
is self-adjoint. Therefore
R = ⊗N
j=1A−1
j .
Remark 3.6. Proposition 3.9 shows the following logical relation:
ker Aj = {0}, j = 1, . . . , N ⇐⇒ker ⊗N
j=1Aj = {0}.

A general form of operators including as special cases SA1,...,AN and

P ⊗

an operator naturally associated with the polynomial P given by (1.55).
Theorem 3.10.
(i) P ⊗

P ⊗

and
σ(P ⊗

(ii) If Dj is a core for Anj
j
(j = 1, . . . , N), then ˆ⊗
N
j=1Dj is a core for
P ⊗
A1,...,AN.
(iii) If Dj is a core for Am
j (j = 1, . . . , N) with some m ∈N, then ˆ⊗
N
j=1Dj
is a core for (SA1,...,AN)m.
Proof. (i) It is easy to see that ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Anj
j ) ⊂ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Akj
j ) for all k =
(k1, . . . , kN) ∈KP . Hence ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Anj
j ) ⊂D(P ⊗
A1,...,AN). Using this fact,
one can prove the desired results in the same way as in the proof of Theorem
3.9(i).
(ii) Let Ψj ∈D(Anj
j ). Then there exists a sequence {Ψ(n)
j
}n in Dj such
that Ψ(n)
j

Therefore
P ⊗
A1,...,AN ⊗N
j=1 Ψ(n)
j

A1,...,AN ⊗N
j=1 Ψj (n →∞). This fact and part (i)
imply the desired property.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈ˆ⊗
N
j=1Dj. Then Ψ ∈D((SA1,...,AN)m) ⊂D((SA1,...,AN )m).
Using the commutativity of eAj’s, we have
(SA1,...,AN)mΨ =

We denote by D(n)

the generalized partial diﬀerential operator in the vari-

Let Ud,N : ⊗NL2(Rd) →L2(RdN) be the natural isomorphism (Example
2.4):
Ud,Nf1 ⊗· · · ⊗fN = f1 × · · · × fN,
fn ∈L2(Rd), n = 1, . . . , N.
Then, for all fn ∈C∞

Recall that C∞

Example 3.2. For n = 1, . . . , N, let Vn be a real-valued Borel measurable
function on Rd which is a.e. ﬁnite with respect to the Lebesgue measure on
Rd. Then the multiplication operator by the function Vn is a self-adjoint
operator on L2(Rd). We denote it by the same symbol Vn. It is easy to see
that, for all fn ∈D(Vn) (n = 1, . . . , N),
Ud,N(V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN)f1 ⊗· · · ⊗fN = (V1 × · · · × VN)f1 × · · · × fN.
This implies that, for all Ψ ∈b⊗
N
n=1D(Vn),
(V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN)Ψ = U −1
d,N(V1 × · · · × VN)Ud,NΨ.
By Theorem 3.9(ii), V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN is essentially self-adjoint on b⊗
N
n=1D(Vn).
Hence, by Proposition 1.22, V1 × · · · × VN is essentially self-adjoint on
Ud,N[b⊗
N
n=1D(Vn)] and operator equality
Ud,N(V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN)U −1
d,N = V1 × · · · × VN
(3.47)

A basic example of (V1, . . . , VN) is given as follows: Vn(x(n)) = x(n)

X(n)

j
(3.48)
holds, where the right hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the

Using formula (3.48), one can see how a general multiplication operator
on L2(RdN) acts on ⊗N
n=1L2(Rd). Let V be a (not necessarily real-valued)
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
141
Borel measurable function on RdN such that |V | is a.e. ﬁnite with respect
to the Lebesgue measure on RdN. The set
X := {X(n)
j
|j = 1, . . . , d, n = 1, . . . , N}
of self-adjoint operators is strongly commuting. Hence one can deﬁne via
functional calculus the operator
V (X) :=
Z
RdN V (λ)dEX(λ)
on ⊗N
n=1L2(Rd), where EX is the joint spectral measure of X. Then, by
the unitary covariance of functional calculus, one has operator equality

d,N = V.
3.9
Point Spectra of Tensor Product of Self-adjoint
Operators
Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj and SA1,...,AN
be deﬁned by (3.40). Then, by Theorem 3.8(i), the closure SA1,...,AN of
SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint and its spectrum is given by (3.41). In this section,
we identify the point spectrum of SA1,...,AN . For this purpose, we recall the
multiplication operator form of spectral theorem of a self-adjoint operator:
Theorem 3.11. Let H be a separable Hilbert space and T be a self-adjoint
operator on H . Then there exist a ﬁnite measure space (X, Σ, µ), a real-
valued Σ-measurable function F on X which is a.e. ﬁnite with respect to µ,
and a unitary transformation U : H →L2(X, dµ) such that UT U −1 = F
(the multiplication operator by the function F).
Proof. See, e.g., Theorem VIII.4 in [Reed and Simon (1980)].
The next theorem gives the identiﬁcation of the point spectrum of
SA1,...,AN and ⊗N
j=1Aj:
Theorem 3.12. Assume that, for all j = 1, . . . , N, Hj is separable. Then:

(3.51)
Remark 3.7. In the case where 0 ∈σp(Aj0) for some j0 and σp(Aj1) = ∅
for some j1 ̸= j0, (3.50) does not hold, because, in this case, the set on the
right hand side of (3.50) is empty, but, 0 ∈σp(⊗N
j=1Aj) (note that, if ψj0 ∈
(ker Aj0) \ {0} and ψj ∈D(Aj) \ {0}, j ̸= j0, then (⊗N
j=1Aj)(⊗N
j=1ψj) = 0).
This is the reason why the two cases (ii) and (iii) should be considered
separately.
Proof. (i) It is suﬃcient to show (3.49) in the case N = 2, because (3.49)
with N ≥3 then follows from induction in N with the natural idetiﬁcation
⊗N+1
j=1 Hj ∼= (⊗N
j=1Hj) ⊗HN+1 and the corresponding unitary equivalence
beween SA1,...,AN+1 and (SA1,...,AN) ⊗I + I ⊗AN+1.
Let S := SA1,A2 and Λ := {λ1 + λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)}. Then,
by (3.30), Λ ⊂σp(S). Hence we need only to prove the converse inclusion
relation.
Let λ ∈σp(S). There exists a non-zero vector Ψ ∈D(S) such that SΨ =
λΨ. By Theorem 3.11, there exist ﬁnite measure spaces (Xj, Σj, µj) (j =
1, 2), measurable functions Fj on Xj which are µj-a.e. ﬁnite respectively,
and unitary transformations Uj : Hj →L2(Xj, dµj), j = 1, 2, such that
UjAjU −1
j
= Fj. Then U1 ⊗U2 is a unitary transformation from H1 ⊗H2
to L2(X1, dµ1) ⊗L2(X2, dµ2) and the following operator equalities hold:
(U1 ⊗U2)(A1 ⊗I)(U1 ⊗U2)−1 = F1 ⊗I,
(U1 ⊗U2)(I ⊗A2)(U1 ⊗U2)−1 = I ⊗F2.
Let W : L2(X1, dµ1) ⊗L2(X2, dµ2) →L2(X1 × X2, d(µ1 ⊗µ2)) be the
natural isomorphism. Then U := WU1 ⊗U2 is a unitary transformation
from H1 ⊗H2 to L2(X1 × X2, d(µ1 ⊗µ2)) and operator equality
USU −1 = F1 + F2
holds, where the right hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the
function F1 + F2 on L2(X1 × X2, d(µ1 ⊗µ2)). Hence, letting Φ := UΨ, we

have (F1+F2)Φ = λΦ · · · (∗). Since 0 <

X1×X2 |Φ(x, y)|2dµ1(x)⊗dµ2(y) <
∞, it follows from Fubini’s theorem, that there exists a subset K ⊂X2
such that µ2(K) > 0 and, for all y ∈K, R
X1 |Φ(x, y)|2dµ1(x) > 0. By
(∗), we have R
X1 |F1(x) + F2(y) −λ|2|Φ(x, y)|2dµ1(x) = 0, y ∈K. Hence,
letting φy(·) := Φ(·, y) (y ∈K), we see that φy is in L2(X1, dµ1) \ {0} and
(F1 + F2(y) −λ)φy = 0 as an equality in L2(X1, dµ1). Therefore λ −F2(y)
is an eigenvalue of F1. For s ∈σp(A1) = σp(F1), let Ks := {y ∈X2|s = λ−
F2(y)}. Then K ⊂∪s∈σp(A1)Ks. Since H1 is separable, it follows that the
cardinality of σp(A1) is at most countable. Hence there exists a λ1 ∈σp(A1)
such that µ2(Kλ1) > 0. Then the characteristic function χKλ1 of Kλ1 is a
non-zero element of L2(X2, dµ2) satisfying F2χKλ1 = (λ −λ1)χKλ1 . Hence
λ2 := λ −λ1 is in σp(F2) = σp(A2). Thus λ = λ1 + λ2 ∈Λ, implying
σp(S) ⊂Λ.
(ii) By a reason similar to that in (i), it is suﬃcient to show (3.50) in
the case N = 2. It follows from Proposition 3.7 that
{λ1λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)} ⊂σp(A1 ⊗A2).
(3.52)
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(A1 ⊗A2). Then
there exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈D(A1 ⊗A2) satisfying A1 ⊗A2ψ = λψ.
Let η := Uψ. Then, in the same manner as in the proof of (i), we can
show that there exists a subset Y ⊂X2, µ2(Y ) > 0 and, for all y ∈Y ,
R
X1 |η(x, y)|2dµ1(x) > 0 and
R
X1 |F1(x)F2(y) −λ|2|η(x, y)|2dµ1(x) = 0.
Hence, letting ηy(·) := η(·, y) (y ∈Y ), we see that ηy is in L2(X1, dµ1)\{0}
and (F1F2(y)−λ)ηy = 0 as an equality in L2(X1, dµ1). Since 0 ̸∈σp(A2), it
follows that F2(y) ̸= 0 for µ2-a.e.y. Hence, letting Y ′ := {y ∈Y |F2(y) ̸= 0},
we have that µ2(Y ′) > 0 and, for all y ∈Y ′, λ/F2(y) is an elgenvalue of F1.
For s ∈σp(A1) = σp(F1), let Ys := {y ∈X2|F2(y) ̸= 0, s = λ/F2(y)}. Then
Y ′ ⊂∪s∈σp(A1)Ys. Hence there exists a λ1 ∈σp(A1) such that µ2(Yλ1) > 0.
Then the characteristic function χYλ1 is a non-zero element of L2(X2, dµ2)
satisfying F2χYλ1 = (λ/λ1)χYλ1 . Hence λ2 := λ/λ1 is in σp(F2) = σp(A2).
Thus λ = λ1λ2 implying σp(A1 ⊗A2) ⊂{λ1λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)}.
(iii) In the present case too, (3.52) holds. By this fact and the above
remark, we have {0} ∪{λ1λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)} ⊂σp(A1 ⊗A2).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(A1 ⊗A2). Then there
exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈D(A1 ⊗A2) satisfying A1 ⊗A2ψ = λψ. It is
suﬃcient to consider the case where λ ̸= 0. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that 0 ∈σp(A2). Let η := Uψ and Y be the set in the proof
of (ii) and Y0 := {y ∈Y |F2(y) = 0}. Then it follows that, for all y ∈Y0,
ηy = 0. But ηy ̸= 0 for all y ∈Y . Hence Y0 = ∅. Therefore, for all y ∈Y ,

F2(y) ̸= 0 and F1ηy = (λ/F2(y))ηy. Then, in the same manner as in the
proof of (ii), one can show that, for some λj ∈σp(Aj) (j = 1, 2), λ = λ1λ2.
Hence the converse inclusion relation of (3.52) holds.
We can also clarify structures of the eigenspaces of SA1,...,AN and
⊗N
j=1Aj. To state them, we introduce some symbols.
For a self-adjoint operator A on a Hilbert space H , we deﬁne the fol-
lowing two closed subspaces:
Hp(A) := Ran EA(σp(A)),
Hc(A) := Ran EA(σc(A)),
(3.53)
where EA is the spectral measure of A and σp(A) (resp.
σc(A)) is the
point (resp. continuous) spectrum of A. Since the residual spectrum of A
is empty (see Theorem 1.11(ii)), it follows that
σ(A) = σp(A) ∪σc(A)
and hence
H = Hp(A) ⊕Hc(A).
(3.54)
The operator A is reduced by Hp(A) and Hc(A) respectively. We denote
the reduced part of A to Hp(A) (resp. Hc(A)) by Ap (resp. Ac). Hence
we have the direct sum decomposition
A = Ap ⊕Ac
(3.55)
relative to (3.54).
Theorem 3.13. Assume that each Hj (j = 1, . . . , n) is separable.
(i)
Hp(SA1,...,AN) = ⊗N
j=1Hp(Aj)
and
 SA1,...,AN

p = SA1p,...,ANp,
where Ajp is the reduced part of Aj to Hp(Aj).
(ii)
Hp(⊗N
j=1Aj) =

⊗N
j=1Hp(Aj) ∩(ker Aj)⊥
⊕ker(⊗N
j=1Aj).
(3.56)
Proof. We need only to consider the case N = 2 (see the remark at the
beginning of the proof of Theorem 3.12).
(i) We set S := SA1,A2. By (3.54) and (3.55), we have
Hj = Hp(Aj) ⊕Hc(Aj),
Aj = Ajp ⊕Ajc,
j = 1, 2.
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
145
Hence
H1 ⊗H2 = (Hp(A1) ⊗Hp(A2)) ⊕(Hp(A1) ⊗Hc(A2))
⊕(Hc(A1) ⊗Hp(A2)) ⊕(Hc(A1) ⊗Hc(A2)),
(3.57)
where the equality is taken in the sense of the natural identiﬁcation. By
Proposition 3.4(ii), S is reduced by each H#(A1) ⊗H♮(A2) (#, ♮= p, c)
with the reduced part equal to A1# ⊗I + I ⊗A2♮and
S = ⊕#,♮=p,c
 A1# ⊗I + I ⊗A2♮

relative to (3.57).
By Theorem 3.12(i), A1c ⊗I + I ⊗A2♮and A1# ⊗I + I ⊗A2c have
no eigenvalues.
Hence Hp(S)
=
Hp(A1) ⊗Hp(A2) and Sp
=
A1p ⊗I + I ⊗A2p.
(ii) In the same manner as in (i), we ﬁrst note that
Hp(A1⊗A2) = (Hp(A1)⊗Hp(A2))⊕(ker A1⊗Hc(A2))⊕(Hc(A1)⊗ker A2).
Using the decomposition Hp(Aj) = ker Aj ⊕Kj with Kj := Hp(Aj) ∩
(ker Aj)⊥(j = 1, 2), we see that Hp(A1 ⊗A2) = (K1 ⊗K2) ⊕K0, where
K0 ⊂ker(A1 ⊗A2). But it is easily shown by a limiting argument that
K1 ⊗K2 ⊥ker(A1 ⊗A2). Hence K0 = ker(A1 ⊗A2). Thus we obtain (3.56)
with N = 2.
Remark 3.8. By (3.56) and Remark 3.6, if each Aj is injective, then
Hp(⊗N
j=1Aj) = ⊗N
j=1Hp(Aj).

Exponential Type Operators Formed Out of Tensor
Products of Self-adjoint Operators
Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a Hilbert space and Aj be a self-adjoint operator
on Hj. Then the operator SA1,...,AN deﬁned by (3.40) is essentially self-
adjoint and has properties as described in Theorem 3.8.
Theorem 3.14. Suppose that each Aj is bounded from below.
Then
SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint and bounded from below. Moreover, for all z ∈C+,
e−zSA1,...,AN is bounded and
e−zSA1,...,AN = ⊗N
j=1e−zAj.
(3.58)
Proof. The ﬁrst half of the theorem is just a restatement of Theorem
3.8(iv).
 

146
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In the same way as in Theorem 3.5(iii), one can prove that
e−z e
Aj = I ⊗· · · I ⊗e−zAj ⊗I · · · ⊗I.
Hence
e−zSA1,...,AN = e−z e

Thus (3.58) holds.

Tensor Product Operators and Direct Integral
Operators
Let (X, Σ, µ) be a measure space and H be a Hilbert space. We assume
that L2(X, dµ) is separable. Then L2(X, dµ)⊗H is naturally isomorphic to
L2(X, dµ; H ) =
R ⊕
X H dµ (Theorem 2.6). A natural question is: to what
forms are tensor product operators on L2(X, dµ) ⊗H transformed under
this isomorphism ? Below we give a partial answer to this question.
Let U : L2(X, dµ) ⊗H →L2(X, dµ; H ) be the unitary transformation
in Theorem 2.6. Let S be a densely deﬁned closed operator on L2(X, dµ).
Then one can deﬁne a linear operator S0 on L2(X, dµ; H ) as follows:
D(S0) := span {f × u|f ∈D(S), u ∈H },
S0


N
X
j=1
fj × uj

:=
N
X
j=1
(Sfj) × uj,
N ∈N, fj ∈D(S), uj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N.
Then it is easy to see that S0 is a densely deﬁned closable operator and
S ⊗I = U −1S0U on D(S)ˆ⊗H . Since D(S)ˆ⊗H is a core of S ⊗I, it follows
that
S ⊗I = U −1S0U.
Hence
U(S ⊗I)U −1 = S0.
Under the natural identiﬁcation of L2(X, dµ) ⊗H with L2(X, dµ; H ) =
R ⊕
X H dµ, S0 is usually written S simply.
Theorem 3.15. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then
U(I ⊗T )U −1 =
Z ⊕
X
T dµ(x).
(3.59)
 

Tensor Product of Linear Operators
147
Proof. Let
D0 := span {f × u|f ∈L2(X, dµ), u ∈D(T )}.
Then U(L2(X, dµ)ˆ⊗D(T )) = D0 and, by direct commutations, one has
U(I ⊗T )U −1 ↾D0 ⊂
Z ⊕
X
T dµ(x).
Since L2(X, dµ)ˆ⊗D(T ) is a core for I ⊗T , D0 is a core for U(I ⊗T )U −1.
By Theorem 2.7,
R ⊕
X T dµ is self-adjoint. Hence U(I ⊗T )U −1 ⊂
R ⊕
X T dµ(x).
Since U(I ⊗T )U −1 is self-adjoint, (3.59) follows.

This natural isomorphism, written as B2(H , K ) ∼= H ⊗

Remark. A triplet (X , D, {Qj, Pj|j = 1, . . . , n}) consisting of a Hilbert space
X , a subspace D of X and a set {Qj, Pj|j = 1, . . . , n} of symmetric operators
on X is called a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with n de-
grees of freedom if D ⊂∩n
j,k=1D(QjPk) ∩D(PkQj) ∩D(QjQk) ∩D(PjPk)
and {Qj, Pj|j = 1, . . . , n} satisﬁes the Heisenberg CCR with n degrees of
freedom on D (i.e., (∗) with ˆPj and ˆQj replaced by Pj and Qj (j = 1, . . . , n)
holds on D).
In this deﬁnition, one may take D to be dense in X and
an invariant domain of Qj and Pj, j = 1, . . . , n (cf. Problems 11 and 13
in Chapter 1). Problem 6 means that one can construct a representation
of the Heisenberg CCR with n degrees of freedom from a representation of
the Heisenberg CCR with one degree of freedom. This shows an aspect of
usefulness of tensor product concepts in representing algebraic structures.

Chapter 4
Full Fock Spaces and Second
Quantization Operators
For a complex Hilbert space H , the inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n H
of the n-fold tensor product ⊗nH (n ≥0) with ⊗0H := C is called the full Fock
space over H . This Hilbert space is the main subject of this chapter. There is a
fundamental class of linear operators acting in the full Fock space, called second
quantization operators. Basic properties of them are investigated. The full Fock
space is a basis for mathematical theories of quantum ﬁelds.
4.1
Inﬁnite Direct Sum Hilbert Spaces
From this chapter, we develop the theory of Fock spaces, which is one of
the main subjects in the present book. This theory can be viewed as the
theory of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert spaces of certain types. Therefore, to
understand the nature of Fock spaces clearly, it would be better to develop
in advance a general theory of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert spaces. Thus
we ﬁrst present elements of a general theory of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert
spaces.
Let {Hn}∞
n=0 be a sequence of Hilbert spaces (each Hn is a Hilbert
space). Then it is natural to consider the inﬁnite product space of Hn’s:
∞
Y
n=0
Hn :=

Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0
Ψ(n) ∈Hn, n ≥0

.
By deﬁnition, two elements Ψ and Φ in Q∞
n=0 Hn are equal if and only if
Ψ(n) = Φ(n) for all n ≥0. In this case one writes Ψ = Φ.
The set Q∞
n=0 Hn becomes a complex vector space with the following
operations of addition and scalar multiple: For all Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0, Φ =
{Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈Q∞
n=0 Hn, α ∈C,
Ψ + Φ := {Ψ(n) + Φ(n)}∞
n=0,
αΨ := {αΨ(n)}∞
n=0.
151
 

152
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The zero vector is given by 0 = {0Hn}∞
n=0, where 0Hn denotes the zero
vector in Hn (we simply write it 0 below). Hence Ψ = 0 if and only if
Ψ(n) = 0 for all n ≥0.
For each Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈Q∞
n=0 Hn, its inverse vector −Ψ is equal to
{−Ψ(n)}∞
n=0.
By the elementary inequality
|z + w|2 ≤2(|z|2 + |w|2),
z, w ∈C,
(4.1)
we have for all Ψ, Φ ∈Q∞
n=0 Hn and α, β ∈C

n ∈N.
Hence it follows that the subset

is absolutely convergent.1 The mapping ⟨, ⟩: (⊕∞

n=0Hn) →
C is an inner product of ⊕∞
n=0Hn. Moreover, ⊕∞
n=0Hn is complete with
respect to this inner product. Thus ⊕∞
n=0Hn becomes a Hilbert space. This
Hilbert space is called the inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space (or simply
inﬁnite direct sum) of {Hn}∞
n=0.
In the rest of this chapter, we set
H := ⊕∞
n=0Hn.
(4.2)
For each m ≥0 and ψ ∈Hm, there is a vector eψ ∈H deﬁned as follows:
eψ(m) := ψ; eψ(n) := 0 for n ̸= m. Then the correspondence ψ 7→˜ψ gives an

)
of H. In this sense we can identify each element ψ of Hm with the element
eψ in H and Hm with f
Hm. In what follows, we freely use this identiﬁcation
( eψ is simply written as ψ if there would be no danger of confusion). Under
this natural identiﬁcation, each vector Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈H is written as
Ψ = P∞
n=0 Ψ(n), which expresses a natural orthogonal decomposition of Ψ
(note that, under the mentioned identiﬁcation, Ψ(n) ⊥Ψ(m), n ̸= m).
Let Dn be a subspace of Hn (n ≥0). Then one can deﬁne a subspace
of H by
⊕∞
n=0Dn := {Ψ ∈H|Ψ(n) ∈Dn, n ≥0}.
One can also deﬁne a smaller subspace as follows:

(ii) If each Dn is dense in Hn, then b⊕
∞
n=0Dn is dense in H.
(iii) If each Dn is dense in Hn, then ⊕∞
n=0Dn is dense in H.
Proof. (i) An easy exercise.
(ii) For each Ψ ∈H and N ∈N, we deﬁne ΨN ∈H by Ψ(n)
N
:= 0, n ≥
N + 1; Ψ(n)
N
:= Ψ(n), n ≤N. Then
∥ΨN −Ψ∥2 =
∞
X
n=N+1
∥Ψ(n)∥2 →0 (N →∞).
Hence, for any ε > 0, there exists an N0 ∈N such that, for all N ≥N0,
∥ΨN −Ψ∥< ε/2. By the density of Dn in Hn, there exist vectors Φ(m) ∈
Dm, m = 0, . . . , N0, such that ∥Φ(m) −Ψ(m)
N0 ∥< ε/(2(N0 + 1)). Hence the

vector χ := {Φ(0), . . . , Φ(N0), 0, 0, . . .} is in b⊕
∞
n=0Dn and ∥χ −ΨN0∥< ε/2.
Therefore, using the triangle inequality, we have ∥χ −Ψ∥< ε. This implies
that b⊕
∞
n=0Dn is dense in ⊕∞
n=0Hn.
(iii) This follows from (4.3) and (ii).
With regard to CONS’s of H, one has the following fact:
Proposition 4.2. Let {e(n)
j
}∞
j=1 be a CONS of Hn. Then {g
e(n)
j
|j ∈N, n ≥
0} is a CONS of H.
Proof. It is easy to see that the set S := {g
e(n)
j
|j ∈N, n ≥0} is an ONS
of H. The subspace Fn := span
n
e(n)
j
o∞
j=1 is dense in Hn and span S =
b⊕
∞
n=0Fn. Hence, by Proposition 4.1(ii), span S is dense in H. Thus S is a
CONS of H.
Proposition 4.2 immediately yields the following corollary:
Corollary 4.1. If each Hn is separable (n ≥0), then H is separable.

Inﬁnite Direct Sum Operators
Let Kn (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) be Hilbert spaces and
K := ⊕∞
n=0Kn.
For each set {An}∞
n=0 of linear operators An from Hn to Kn (i.e. An ∈
L(Hn, Kn)), one can deﬁne a linear operator ⊕∞
n=0An ∈L(H, K) as follows:
D(⊕∞

The operator ⊕∞
n=0An is called the inﬁnite direct sum operator (or
simply the inﬁnite direct sum) of {An}∞
n=0.
It is obvious that

Remark 4.1. Similarly one can deﬁne also a ﬁnite direct sum operator

The theory of ﬁnite direct sum operators can be developed quite parallel
to that of inﬁnite direct sum operators in an easier way.
In what follows, we set
A := ⊕∞
n=0An.
(4.5)
With regard to the injectivity of A, we have the following:
Proposition 4.3. ker A = ⊕∞
n=0 ker An. In particular, A is injective if and
oly if An is injective for all n ≥0.
Proof. Let Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈ker A.
Then 0 = AΨ = {AnΨ(n)}∞
n=0.
Hence, for all n ≥0, AnΨ(n) = 0, i.e., Ψ(n) ∈ker An.
Hence Ψ ∈
⊕∞
n=0 ker An. Thus ker A ⊂⊕∞
n=0 ker An. The converse inclusion relation is
obvious.
The next proposition is a basic fact on the boundedness of an inﬁnite
direct sum operator.
Proposition 4.4. Let An ∈B(Hn, Kn), n ≥0. Then A ∈B(H, K) if and
only if
sup
n≥0
∥An∥< ∞.
(4.6)
In that case,
∥A∥= sup
n≥0
∥An∥.
(4.7)
Proof. Let CA := supn≥0 ∥An∥which may be inﬁnite.
Suppose that A ∈B(H, K). Then, for all Ψ ∈H, ∥AΨ∥≤∥A∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence P∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 ≤∥A∥2∥Ψ∥2. Taking Ψ to be a vector such that
Ψ(m) = 0, ∀m ̸= n, one has ∥AnΨ(n)∥≤∥A∥∥Ψ(n)∥. This implies that
∥An∥≤∥A∥. Hence CA ≤∥A∥< ∞. Thus (4.6) holds.
Conversely, suppose that (4.6) holds: CA < ∞. Then, for all Ψ ∈H,
∞
X
n=0
∥AnΨ(n)∥2 ≤C2
A
∞
X
n=0
∥Ψ(n)∥2 = C2
A∥Ψ∥2 < ∞.
This implies that D(A) = H and ∥AΨ∥≤CA∥Ψ∥. Hence A ∈B(H, K) and
∥A∥≤CA. These arguments imply (4.7) too.

Remark 4.2. It follows from Proposition 4.4 that, even if all An’s are
bounded, A is unbounded if supn≥0 ∥An∥= ∞.
The following fact on the unboundedness of A also is fundamental.
Proposition 4.5. If at least one of An’s is unbounded, then A is un-
bounded.
Proof. By the present assumption, there is a k ∈{0} ∪N such that Ak
is unbounded. Then there exists a sequence {ψN}∞
N=1 in D(Ak) such that
∥ψN∥= 1, ∥AkψN∥→∞(N →∞). We deﬁne a vector ΨN ∈H by
Ψ(k)
N := ψN; Ψ(n)
N
:= 0, n ̸= k. Then ΨN ∈D(A), ∥ΨN∥= 1 and ∥AΨN∥=
∥AkψN∥→∞(N →∞). Hence A is unbounded.
The next proposition is concerned with convergences of a sequence of
bounded inﬁnite direct sum operators.
Proposition 4.6. Let An,N, An ∈B(Hn, Kn), n ≥0, N ∈N and
A(N) :=
∞
M
n=0
An,N.
Suppose that
sup
n≥0,N∈N
∥An,N∥< ∞.
(4.8)
Then A(N) ∈B(H, K) and the following (i)–(iii) hold:
(i) If w- limN→∞An,N = An for all n ≥0, then A ∈B(H, K) and
w- lim
N→∞A(N) = A.
(4.9)
(ii) If s- limN→∞An,N = An,
n ≥0, then A ∈B(H, K) and
s- lim
N→∞A(N) = A.
(4.10)
(iii) If limN→∞supn≥0 ∥An,N −An∥= 0, then A ∈B(H, K) and
u- lim
N→∞A(N) = A.
(4.11)
Proof. The fact A(N) ∈B(H, K) follows from (4.8) and Proposition 4.4.
(i) Let Φ ∈K and Ψ ∈D(A). Then
⟨Φ, A(N)Ψ⟩=

We have

D

where C := supn≥0,N∈N ∥An,N∥< ∞, and P∞
n=0 ∥Φ(n)∥∥Ψ(n)∥< ∞.
Hence, by the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain
lim
N→∞⟨Φ, A(N)Ψ⟩=

Φ(n), AnΨ(n)E
= ⟨Φ, AΨ⟩.
Hence
| ⟨Φ, AΨ⟩| = lim
N→∞| ⟨Φ, A(N)Ψ⟩| ≤C∥Φ∥∥Ψ∥.
Therefore ∥AΨ∥≤C∥Ψ∥, implying that A is bounded. Since ˆ⊕
∞
n=0Hn ⊂
D(A), D(A) is dense. To prove that A is closed, let D(A) ∋ΨN →Ψ ∈
H, AΨN →η ∈K as N →∞.
Then, for each n ≥0, Ψ(n)
N
→Ψ(n)
and AnΨ(n)
N
→η(n) as N →∞. Since An ∈B(Hn, Kn), it follows that
η(n) = AnΨ(n). Hence P∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 = P∞
n=0 ∥η(n)∥2 < ∞. Therefore
Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ = η.
Thus A is closed.
In general, the domain of
a densely deﬁned closed bounded operator from a Hilbert space X to a
Hilbert space is equal to X . Hence D(A) = H. Thus A ∈B(H, K) and
(4.9) holds.
(ii) Since strong convergence implies weak convergence, by part (i),
we need only to prove (4.10).
For each Ψ ∈H, ∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 =
P∞
n=0 ∥An,NΨ(n) −AnΨ(n)∥2. By the present assumption, for all n ≥0,
limN→∞∥An,NΨ(n) −AnΨ(n)∥2 = 0. Moreover
∥An,NΨ(n) −AnΨ(n)∥2 ≤2(∥An,NΨ(n)∥2 + ∥AnΨ(n)∥2) ≤4C2∥Ψ(n)∥2.
Hence,
by the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain limN→∞
∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 = 0. Thus (4.10) holds.
(iii) Since uniform convergence implies strong convergence, by part (ii)
(or (i)), we need only to prove (4.11). Let dN := supn≥0 ∥An,N−An∥. Then,
for all Ψ ∈H, we have ∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 ≤d2
N∥Ψ∥2. Hence ∥A(N) −A∥≤
dN →0 (N →∞).
We now investigate how properties of each An are related to those of
A. We ﬁrst consider the general case where Hn is not necessarily equal to
Kn.

Theorem 4.1.
(i) If each D(An) (n ≥0) is dense in Hn, then D(A) is dense in H.
Moreover,
A∗= ⊕∞
n=0A∗
n.
(4.12)
(ii) Let each An be closed. Then A is closed. Moreover, if each An has a
core Dn, then b⊕

n=0Dn is a core for A.
(iii) If each An is unitary, then A is unitary.
(iv) If each An is a contraction operator, then A is a contraction operator.
(v) If each An is compact2 and limn→∞∥An∥= 0, then A is compact.
Proof. (i) We have b⊕
∞
n=0D(An) ⊂D(A). By the density of D(An) in Hn
and Proposition 4.1(i), b⊕
∞
n=0D(An) is dense in H. Hence D(A) is dense in
H.
For all Φ = {Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(⊕∞
n=0A∗

This implies that Φ ∈D(A∗) and A∗Φ = (⊕∞
n=0A∗
n) Φ. Hence ⊕∞
n=0A∗
n ⊂
A∗.
Conversely, Let Φ = {Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(A∗) and Ξ := A∗Φ. Then, for all
Ψ ∈D(A), ⟨Ξ, Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, AΨ⟩. For each n ≥0, taking Ψ satisfying Ψ(m) = 0
for all m ̸= n, we have

Ξ(n), Ψ(n)
=

Φ(n), AnΨ(n)
. Since Ψ(n) is an
arbitrary element in D(An), it follows that Φ(n) ∈D(A∗
n) and A∗
nΦ(n) =
Ξ(n). Hence P∞
n=0 ∥A∗
nΦ(n)∥2 = ∥Ξ∥2 < ∞, implying Φ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0A∗
n).
Hence D(A∗) ⊂D(⊕∞
n=0A∗
n). Thus (4.12) holds.
(ii) Let N ∈N, ΨN = {Ψ(n)
N }∞
n=0 ∈D(A), ΨN →Ψ ∈H, AΨN →
Φ ∈K (N →∞). Then, for each n, Ψ(n)
N
→Ψ(n), AnΨ(n)
N
→Φ(n) (N →
∞). By the closedness of An, Ψ(n) ∈D(An) and AnΨ(n) = Φ(n). Hence
P∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 = P∞
n=0 ∥Φ(n)∥2 = ∥Φ∥2 < ∞. Therefore Ψ ∈D(A) and
AΨ = Φ. Thus A is closed.
Let D = b⊕
∞
n=0Dn and (Ψ, AΨ) ∈G (A ↾D)⊥∩G (A). Then, for all
Φ ∈D(A), ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩+ ⟨AΨ, AΦ⟩= 0. Hence, for all n ≥0,

Ψ(n), Φ(n)
+

AnΨ(n), AnΦ(n)
= 0. This means that (Ψ(n), AnΨ(n)) ∈G (An ↾Dn)⊥∩
G (An). Hence, by an application of Proposition 1.9, Ψ(n) = 0, AnΨ(n) = 0,
implying (Ψ, AΨ) = 0. Thus, by Proposition 1.9 again, D is a core for A.

(iii) By the present assumption, Ran(An) = Kn, n ≥0. Hence, for any
Φ ∈K and n ≥0, there exists a vector Ψ(n) ∈Hn such that AnΨ(n) = Φ(n).
Since An is isometry, one has ∥Φ(n)∥2 = ∥Ψ(n)∥2. Hence P∞
n=0 ∥Ψ(n)∥2 =
∥Φ∥2 < ∞. Therefore the vector Ψ := {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 is in H and AΨ = Φ.
Hence A is surjective. For all Ψ ∈H, we have ∥AΨ∥= P∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 =
P∞
n=0 ∥Ψ(n)∥2 = ∥Ψ∥2. Hence A is isometry. Thus A is unitary.
(iv) By the present assumption, ∥An∥≤1 for all n ≥0. Hence, by
Proposition 4.4, ∥A∥≤1.
(v) By the present assumption, for any ε > 0, there exists an N0 ∈N
such that, for all N ≥N0, ∥An∥< ε.
For each N ∈N, we deﬁne an inﬁnite direct sum operator A(N) =
⊕∞
n=0A(N)n by A(N)n := An for n = 0, . . . , N and A(N)n = 0 for n ≥
N + 1. Then, for all Ψ ∈H and N ≥N0,
∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 =

X
n=N+1
∥AnΨ(n)∥2 ≤( sup
n≥N+1
∥An∥)2∥Ψ∥2
≤ε2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence ∥A(N) −A∥≤ε, N ≥N0. Thus u- limN→∞A(N) = A. Therefore
we need only to prove that A(N) is compact.
Let {Ψm}∞
m=1 be any bounded sequence in H.
Then, for all n ≥0,
{Ψ(n)
m }∞
m=1 is a bounded sequence in Hn. By the compactness of A0, there
exists a subsequence {m0(k)}k of {1, 2, . . .} such that {A0Ψ(0)
m0(k)}k con-
verges in H0. Then, by the compactness of A1, there exists a subsequence
{m1(k)}k of {m0(k)}k such that {A1Ψ(1)
m1(k)}k converges in H1. By repeat-
ing this procedure, one can construct a set of subsequences {{mn(k)}k|n =
0, 1, 2, . . .} satisfying the following conditions: (a) for all n ≥1, {mn(k)}k
is a subsequence of {mn−1(k)}k ; (b) For all n ≥0, {AnΨ(n)
mn(k)}k converges
in Hn. Let Φk ∈H be such that Φ(n)
k
= Ψ(n)
mk(k), k ≥1. Then {Φk}k is a
subsequence of {Ψm}∞
m=1 and, for all n ≥0, {AnΦ(n)
k }k converges in Hn.
Hence {A(N)Φk}k converges. Thus A(N) is compact.
We next consider the case where Hn = Kn so that H = K.

dist(z, σ(An)),
z ∈ρ(An),
(4.15)
where dist(z, σ(An)) denotes the distance between z and σ(An) (see
(1.24)). Then
σ(A) = ∪∞
n=0σ(An).
(4.16)
Moreover, for all z ∈ρ(A),
(A −z)−1 = ⊕∞
n=0(An −z)−1.
(4.17)
(iii) Let
ρint :=

Then, ρint ⊂ρ(A) and, for all z ∈ρint, (4.17) holds.
(iv) (point spectrum)
∪∞
n=0σp(An) = σp(A).
(4.18)
(v) Suppose that each An (n ∈{0} ∪N) is symmetric. Then A is sym-
metric. Moreover, A is bounded from below with A ≥γ (γ ∈R) if and
only if {An}∞
n=0 is uniformly bounded from below, i.e., for all n ≥0,
An ≥γ.
(vi) If each An is self-adjoint, then A is self-adjoint. Moreover, if each An
is essentially self-adjoint on Dn, then A is essentially self-adjoint on
b⊕
∞
n=0Dn.
(vii) If each An is an orthogonal projection, then A is an orthogonal pro-
jection.
Proof. (i) Let z ∈ρ(A). Then Ran(A −z) is dense and A −z is injective
with (A −z)−1 bounded. Let ψ ∈ker(An −z). Then, taking a vector
Ψ ∈H satisfying Ψ(n) := ψ, Ψ(m) := 0, m ̸= n, we see that Ψ ∈D(A)
and (A −z)Ψ = 0. Hence Ψ = 0, which implies that ψ = 0. Hence An
is injective. To prove that Ran(An −z) is dense, let φ ∈(Ran(An −z))⊥.
Then, for all ψ ∈D(An), ⟨(An −z)ψ, φ⟩= 0. Let Φ ∈H be such that
Φ(n) = φ and Φ(m) = 0 for m ̸= n. Then it follows that, for all Ψ ∈D(A),
⟨(A −z)Ψ, Φ⟩= 0. Hence Φ = 0, implying that φ = 0. Thus Ran(An −z)
is dense. Since (A −z)−1 is bounded, there exists a constant C > 0 such
that ∥(A −z)Ψ∥≥C∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈D(A).
This implies that, for any ψ ∈
D(An), ∥(An −z)ψ∥≥C∥ψ∥. Hence (An −z)−1 is bounded. Therefore

z ∈ρ(An) for all n ≥0, i.e., z ∈∩∞
n=0ρ(An). Thus (4.13) holds. Taking
the complement relation of (4.13) gives (4.14).
(ii) In the present case, A is closed by Theorem 4.1(ii). Hence, by (4.14),
∪∞
n=0σ(An) ⊂σ(A).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let D := ∪∞
n=0σ(An) \∪∞
n=0σ(An).
Then ∪∞
n=0σ(An) = D ∪[∪∞
n=0σ(An)]. Hence we need only to show that
σ(A) ⊂D ∪[∪∞
n=0σ(An)]. This is equivalent to ρ(A) ⊃Dc ∩[∩∞
n=0ρ(An)].
So let us prove this inclusion relation. Let z ∈Dc ∩[∩∞
n=0ρ(An)]. Then,
for all n ≥0, An −z is bijective and (An −z)−1 is bounded.
For any
Ψ ∈H, putting Φ(n) := (An −z)−1Ψ(n), we have Φ(n) ∈D(An) and
(An −z)Φ(n) = Ψ(n) . . . (∗). Since z ∈Dc, there exists a constant δ > 0
such that, for all n ≥0, infλ∈σ(An) |z −λ| ≥δ. Hence dist(z, σ(An)) ≥δ.
Therefore, by (4.15), ∥(An −z)−1∥≤δ−1. Hence

∥Φ(n)∥2 ≤1

∥Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞.
Thus Φ ∈H. Also

Hence Φ ∈D(A). From this fact and (∗), we obtain (A −z)Φ = Ψ · · · (∗∗).
Hence A −z is surjective.
To prove the injectivity of A−z, let Ψ ∈ker(A−z). Then, for all n ≥0,
Ψ(n) ∈D(An) and (An −z)Ψ(n) = 0. Since z ∈ρ(An), Ψ(n) = 0 for all
n ≥0. Hence Ψ = 0. Therefore A −z is injective. Thus A −z is bijective.
Hence z ∈ρ(A).
Equation (∗∗) implies that Φ = (A −z)−1Ψ. Hence (An −z)−1Ψ(n) =
((A −z)−1Ψ)(n), n ≥0. Since supn≥0 ∥(An −z)−1∥≤δ−1 < ∞, it follows
from Proposition 4.4 that ⊕∞
n=0(An −z)−1 ∈B(H). Thus (4.17) holds.
(iii) Let z ∈ρint. Then, by Proposition 4.4, the operator
Rz := ⊕∞
n=0(An −z)−1
is bounded. It is easy to see that (A−z)Rz = I and Rz(A−z) ⊂I. Hence,
z ∈ρ(A) and (A −z)−1 = Rz. Thus the desired result follows.
(iv) Let λ ∈∪∞
n=0σp(An).
Then there is an n0 ≥0 such that
λ ∈σp(An0). Hence there exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈D(An0) such that
 

162
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
An0ψ = λψ. Let Ψ ∈H be such that Ψ(n0) := ψ and Ψ(n) := 0, n ̸= n0.
Then Ψ ∈D(A) \ {0} and AΨ = λΨ.
Hence λ ∈σp(A).
Thus
∪∞
n=0σp(An) ⊂σp(A).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(A). Then there
exists a non-zero vector Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(A) such that AΨ = λΨ. This
implies that AnΨ(n) = λΨ(n), n ≥0. Since Ψ ̸= 0, there exists an n0 ≥0
such that Ψ(n0) ̸= 0. Hence λ ∈σp(An0). Therefore λ ∈∪∞
n=0σp(An).
Thus σp(A) ⊂∪∞
n=0σp(An).
(v) Under the present assumption, each D(An) is dense in Hn. Hence,
by (4.4) and Proposition 4.1(iii), D(A) is dense. For all Ψ ∈D(A),
⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩=
∞
X
n=0
D
Ψ(n), AnΨ(n)E
.
(4.19)
Since

Ψ(n), AnΨ(n)
is a real number, so is ⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩. Hence A is symmetric.
Suppose that A is bounded from below with A ≥γ (γ ∈R).
Let
ψ ∈D(An) and Ψ ∈D(A) be such that Ψ(n) = ψ and Ψ(m) = 0, m ̸= n.
Then ⟨ψ, Anψ⟩= ⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩≥γ∥Ψ∥2 = γ∥ψ∥2. Hence An is bounded from
below with An ≥γ.
Conversely, suppose that, for all n ≥0, An ≥γ. Then, for all Ψ ∈D(A),
⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩=
∞
X
n=0
D
Ψ(n), AnΨ(n)E
≥γ
∞
X
n=0
∥Ψ(n)∥2 = γ∥Ψ∥2.
Hence A is bounded from below with A ≥γ.
(vi) If each An is self-adjoint, then A∗
n = An. Hence, by Theorem 4.1(i),
A∗= A. Thus A is self-adjoint. The statement on essential self-adjointness
of A follows from Theorem4.1(ii).
(vii) The self-adjointness of A follows from (vi). Since supn≥0 ∥An∥≤1,
it follows from Proposition 4.4 that A is bounded with ∥A∥≤1. Hence, for
all Ψ ∈H and n ≥0, (A2Ψ)(n) = An(AΨ)(n) = A2
nΨ(n) = AnΨ(n), where
we have used A2
n = An, n ≥0. Therefore A2 = A. Thus A is an orthogonal
projection.

Sum and Product of Two Inﬁnite Direct Sum Operators
So far we have considered only a single inﬁnite direct sum operator. But,
in applications, one may have the case where ﬁnitely many inﬁnite direct
sum operators are involved. In such a case, their sum or product may be
an interesting object.

Proposition 4.7. Let An, Bn ∈L(Hn, Kn) (n ≥0) and
A := ⊕∞
n=0An,
B := ⊕∞
n=0Bn.
Then:
(i) A + B ⊂⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
(ii) Suppose that, for some constant c > 0,
∥Anψ∥2 + ∥Bnψ∥2 ≤c(∥(An + Bn)ψ∥2 + ∥ψ∥2),
ψ ∈D(An) ∩D(Bn), n ≥0.
Then
A + B = ⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
(4.20)
(iii) If Bn ∈B(Hn, Kn) for all n ≥0 and supn≥0 ∥Bn∥< ∞, then (4.20)
holds.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(A + B) = D(A) ∩D(B). Then P∞
n=0 ∥Ψ(n)∥2 <
∞, P∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞and P∞
n=0 ∥BnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞. Since
∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥2 ≤2(∥AnΨ(n)∥2 + ∥BnΨ(n)∥2),
it follows that P∞
n=0 ∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞. Hence Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0(An +
Bn)). It is easy to see that ((A + B)Ψ)(n) = (An + Bn)Ψ(n), n ≥0. Hence
A + B ⊂⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
(ii) By (i), we need only to show that D (⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)) ⊂D(A+ B).
Let Ψ ∈D (⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)). Then, for all n ≥0, Ψ(n) ∈D(An) ∩D(Bn)
and P∞
n=0 ∥Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞, P∞
n=0 ∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞. By the present
assumption, ∥AnΨ(n)∥2, ∥BnΨ(n)∥2 ≤c(∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥2 + ∥Ψ(n)∥2) for
all n ≥0. Hence it follows that Ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B) = D(A + B).
(iii) In the present case, B ∈B(H, K) by Proposition 4.4. Hence D(A +
B) = D(A). Therefore we need only to show that D (⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)) ⊂
D(A). Let Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)). Then, for all n ≥0,
∥AnΨ(n)∥≤∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥+ ∥BnΨ(n)∥≤∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥+ b∥Ψ(n)∥,
where b := supn≥0 ∥Bn∥.
Hence ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 ≤2(∥(An + Bn)Ψ(n)∥2 +
b2∥Ψ(n)∥2). This implies that Ψ ∈D(A).
Example 4.1. Let us consider the case where Hn = L2(R) for all n ≥0.
We deﬁne An and Bn by An := Dx (the generalized diﬀerential operator on
L2(R)) and Bn := (n + 1)αx (multiplication operator) with α > 2 being a
constant. Let f (n)(x) := e−(n+1)αx2/2, x ∈R. Then f (n) ∈D(An)∩D(Bn)
and
Anf (n) = −(n + 1)αxf (n),
Bnf (n) = (n + 1)αxf (n).
 

164

Hence (An + Bn)f (n) = 0.
It is easy to see that P∞
n=0 ∥f (n)∥2 =
P∞
n=0
√π/(n + 1)α/2 < ∞. Hence f := {f (n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)).
But, since
∥Anf (n)∥2 = ∥Bnf (n)∥2 = c0(n + 1)α/2, c0 :=
Z
R
x2e−x2dx =
√π
2 ,
it follows that P∞
n=0 ∥Anf (n)∥2 = P∞
n=0 ∥Bnf (n)∥2 = ∞. Hence f ̸∈D(A)
and f ̸∈D(B). Thus, in this example, A + B ̸= ⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
By Proposition 4.7(iii) and inductive arguments, one can easily derive
the following fact:
Corollary 4.2. Let k = 1, . . . , N (N ∈N) and A(k)
n
∈B(Hn, Kn) (n ≥0).
Suppose that supn≥0 ∥A(k)
n ∥< ∞, k = 1, . . . , N. Then, for all k = 1, . . . , N,
A(k) := ⊕∞
n=0A(k)
n
is bounded and
N

A(k) = ⊕∞

We next consider the product of two inﬁnite direct sum operators:
Proposition 4.8. Let An be a linear operator from Hn to Kn and Bn be
a linear operator from Kn to a Hilbert space Ln. Let A := ⊕∞
n=0An and
B = ⊕∞
n=0Bn. Then:
(i) BA ⊂⊕∞
n=0BnAn.
(ii) If eacn An is in B(Hn, Kn) with supn≥0 ∥An∥< ∞, then
BA = ⊕∞
n=0BnAn.
(4.21)
(iii) If there exists a constant c > 0 such that, for all n ≥0 and φ ∈D(Bn),
∥Bnφ∥≥c∥φ∥, then (4.21) holds.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(BA). Then Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ ∈D(B). Hence, for
each n ≥0, Ψ(n) ∈D(BnAn) and
∞
X
n=0
∥Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞,
∞
X
n=0
∥AnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞,
∞
X
n=0
∥BnAnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞.
The ﬁrst and last properties imply that Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn). It is obvious
that (BAΨ)(n) = BnAnΨ(n), n ≥0. Thus the desired follows.
(ii) We need only to show that D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn) ⊂D(BA).
Let
Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn).
Then, for all n ≥0, Ψ(n) ∈D(BnAn) and

165
P∞
n=0 ∥BnAnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞.
Under the present assumption, D(A) = H.
Hence Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ ∈D(B). Therefore Ψ ∈D(BA).
(iii) Let Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn). Then P∞
n=0 ∥BnAnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞. Under
the present assumption, ∥BnAnΨ(n)∥2 ≥c2∥AnΨ(n)∥2 for all n ≥0. Hence
P∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ(n)∥2 < ∞. Therefore Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ ∈D(B). Thus the
desired result follows.
Example 4.2. Let Hn, An, f (n) and f be as in Example 4.1. Let Cn :=
(n + 1)−αx−1 (multiplication operator) and C := ⊕∞
n=0Cn. It is easy to
see that, for all n ≥0, f (n) ∈D(CnAn) and CnAnf (n) = −f (n). Hence
f ∈D(⊕∞
n=0CnAn). But f ̸∈D(A) as we have seen in Example 4.1. Thus
CA ̸= ⊕∞
n=0CnAn.
4.4
Diagonal and Non-diagonal Operators on H
Let H be as in (4.2) and, for each n ≥0, Pn be the orthogonal projection
onto the closed subspace Hn of H. We say that a linear operator T on H
is diagonal if T is reduced by each Hn, i.e., for each n ≥0, PnT ⊂T Pn.
In that case, letting Tn be the reduced part of T to Hn, we have
T = ⊕∞
n=0Tn.
Hence T is an inﬁnite direct sum operator on H. Conversely, all inﬁnite
direct sum operators on H are diagonal, as is easily seen.
Of course, there exist non-diagonal operators on H. They also should be
studied. In this section, we introduce a basic class of non-diagonal operators
on H which has applications to mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds and
a generalization of it.
4.4.1
Shift type operators
Let A(n)
+
be a closed operator from Hn to Hn+1 (n ≥0). Then we can
deﬁne a linear operator A+ on H as follows:
D(A+) :=
(
Ψ ∈H
 Ψ(n) ∈D(A(n)
+ ), n ≥0,
∞
X
n=0
∥A(n)
+ Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞
)
,
(A+Ψ)(0) := 0,
(A+Ψ)(n) := A(n−1)
+
Ψ(n−1),
n ≥1.
We call A+ the right shift operator associated with {A(n)
+ }n.
 

166
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 4.3.
(i) The operator A+ on H is closed.
(ii) If D(A(n)
+ ) is dense for all n ≥0, then D(A+) is dense and A∗
+ is given
as follows:
D(A∗

(A∗
+Ψ)(n) := A(n)
+
∗Ψ(n+1),
n ≥0, Ψ ∈D(A∗
+).
(4.23)
Moreover,
A∗
+A+ = ⊕∞
n=0A(n)
+
∗A(n)
+ .
(4.24)
(iii) If each A(n)
+
is in B(Hn, Hn+1) and supn≥0 ∥A(n)
+ ∥< ∞, then A+ is
in B(H) and
∥A+∥≤sup
n≥0
∥A(n)
+ ∥.
Proof. (i) Let {ΨN}∞
N=1 be a sequence in D(A+) such that ΨN →Ψ ∈H
and A+ΨN →Φ ∈H (N →∞).
Hence Φ(0) = 0 and, for all n ≥1,
Ψ(n−1)
N
→Ψ(n−1) and A(n−1)
+
Ψ(n−1)
N
→Φ(n) (N →∞). Hence, by the
closedness of A(n−1)
+
, Ψ(n−1) ∈D(A(n−1)
+
) and A(n−1)
+
Ψ(n−1) = Φ(n). Since
P∞
n=1 ∥Φ(n)∥2 < ∞, it follows that Ψ ∈D(A+) and A+Ψ = Φ. Thus A+
is closed.
(ii) The density of D(A+) follows from the fact that b⊕
∞
n=0D(A(n)
+ ) ⊂
D(A+) and Proposition 4.1(ii). Let D be the set on the right hand side of
(4.22). Then, for all Φ ∈D and Ψ ∈D(A+),
⟨Φ, A+Ψ⟩=

n=0
D
Φ(n+1), A(n)
+ Ψ(n)E
=

D
A(n)
+
∗Φ(n+1), Ψ(n)E
= ⟨η, Ψ⟩,
where η := {A(n)
+
∗Φ(n+1)}∞
n=0 ∈H. Hence Φ ∈D(A∗
+) and A∗
+Φ = η. In
particular, D ⊂D(A∗
+). Conversely, let Φ ∈D(A∗
+). Then, for all Ψ ∈
D(A+),

A∗

= ⟨Φ, A+Ψ⟩. Taking Ψ = {δmnΨ(n)}∞
m=0 with Ψ(n) ∈
D(A(n)
+ ) arbitrary, we obtain

(A∗
+Φ)(n), Ψ(n)
=
D
Φ(n+1), A(n)
+ Ψ(n)E
. This
implies that Φ(n+1) ∈D(A(n)

+
∗Φ(n+1) = (A∗
+Φ)(n). Hence

n=0
∥A(n)

∗Φ(n+1)∥2 = ∥A∗
+Φ∥2 < ∞,

implying that Φ ∈D. Therefore D ⊂D(A∗
+). Thus the statement on A∗
+
is proved.
To prove operator equality (4.24), let Ψ ∈D(A∗
+A+). Then Ψ ∈D(A+)
and A+Ψ ∈D(A∗
+).
Hence it follows that, for each n ≥0, Ψ(n) ∈
D(A(n)
+

+ ),

n=0
∥A(n)

∗A(n)
+ Ψ(n).
Hence A∗
+A+ ⊂⊕∞
n=0A(n)
+
∗A(n)
+ .
By von Neumann’s theorem (Corollary B.1 in Appendix B), A∗
+A+ and
A(n)
+
∗A(n)
+
are self-adjoint. The self-adjointness of A(n)
+
∗A(n)
+
implies that
of ⊕∞
n=0A(n)
+
∗A(n)
+
(by Theorem 3.8(iv)). Thus (4.24) holds.
(iii) An easy exercise.
Remark 4.3. One can deﬁne also the left shift operator A−on H as-
sociated with a sequence {A(n)
−}∞
n=1 of densely closed operators A(n)

Ψ ∈D(A−).
One can prove a theorem similar to Theorem 4.3 for A−.
4.4.2
A general class of non-diagonal operators
For a pair (n, m) of non-negative integers, let Anm be a linear operator
from Hm to Hn. Then one can deﬁne a linear operator A on H as follows:
D(A) :=

Ψ ∈H |for each n, m ≥0, Ψ(m) ∈D(Anm),
P∞
m=0 AnmΨ(m) converges in Hn and
P∞
n=0 ∥P∞
m=0 AnmΨ(m)∥2 < ∞

(AΨ)(n) :=

X
m=0
AnmΨ(m),
n ≥0.
It is obvious that, in the case where An,n−1 = A(n−1)
+
for n ≥1 and
Anm = 0 for m ̸= n −1 , one has A = A+. Hence A is a generalization of
A+.

Inﬁnite Direct Sum Operator of Self-adjoint Operators
We continue to study the inﬁnite direct sum operator A deﬁned by (4.5).
In this section, we concentrate our attention on the case where each An is
self-adjoint. In that case, A is self-adjoint (Theorem 4.2(vi)). Throughout
this section, we assume that Hn = Kn. We ﬁrst present fundamental facts
needed for analysis of self-adjoint inﬁnite direct sum operators.
For each n ≥0, let E(n)(·) be a d-dimensional spectral measure on Hn
(d ∈N). Since E(n)(B) (B ∈Bd) is an orthogonal projection, it follows
from Theorem 4.2(vii) that the inﬁnite direct sum operator
E(B) := ⊕∞
n=0E(n)(B) (B ∈Bd),
of {E(n)(B)}∞
n=0 is an orthogonal projection.
Lemma 4.1. {E(B)|B ∈Bd} is a d-dimensional spectral measure.
Proof. It is obvious that E(∅) = 0, E(Rd) = I.
Let Bj ∈Bd satisfy-
ing Bj ∩Bk = ∅, j ̸= k and set B = ∪∞
j=1Bj, B(N) := ∪N
j=1Bj. Then
s- limN→∞E(n)(B(N)) = E(n)(B) and ∥E(n)(B(N))∥≤1, ∥E(n)(B)∥≤1.
Hence, by Proposition 4.6, s- limN→∞E(B(N)) = E(B).
By an ap-
plication of Corollary 4.2, we have E(B(N)) = PN
j=1 E(Bj).
Hence
E(B) = s- limN→∞
PN
j=1 E(Bj). Therefore {E(B)|B ∈Bd} is a dimen-
sional spectral measure.
Lemma 4.2. Let f be a non-negative Borel measurable function on Rd and
Ψ ∈H. Then
C1 :=

In that case, C1 = C2.

have C2 ≤C1 < ∞. Thus (4.26) holds.
Conversely, suppose that (4.26) holds. Then, for any N ∈N, the left
hand side of (4.27) is less than or equal to C2. Hence
aN :=
Z
Rd f(λ)d ⟨ΨN, E(λ)ΨN⟩≤C2.
Since ⟨ΨN, E(B)ΨN⟩≤⟨ΨN+1, E(B)ΨN+1⟩for all N ≥0 and B ∈
Bd, the sequence {aN}N is monotone increasing in N.
Hence the
limit a := limN→∞aN exists and a ≤C2.

Rd f(λ)d ⟨Ψ, E(λ)Ψ⟩= C1. Hence C1 ≤a ≤C2. Thus (4.25) holds.
If one of (4.25) and (4.26) holds, then the above proof shows that C1 =
C2.

(4.28)
Proof. In the case where f ≥0, (4.28) is proved in the preceding lemma.
Let f be real-valued. Then one can write f = f+ −f−, where f+(λ) :=
max{f(λ), 0}, f−(λ) := max{−f(λ), 0}, λ ∈Rd. It is obvious that 0 ≤
f±(λ) ≤|f(λ)|. Hence f± satisfy (4.25) or (4.26) with f replaced by f±.
Therefore (4.28) with f replaced by f± holds. This implies (4.28).
Finally we consider a general f. Then we write f = f1 + if2, where
f1 := Re f, f2 := Im f. Then, by the preceding result, (4.28) holds with f
replaced by f1 and f2. Hence (4.28) holds.
3Use the following general fact: Let (X, Σ) be a measurable space. Let {µn}∞
n=1 be a
sequence of measures on (X, Σ) and µ be a measure on (X, Σ) such that, for all B ∈Σ,
limn→∞µn(B) = µ(B). Then, for any non-negative Σ-measurable function f on X,

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The following theorem has important applications to the theory of Fock
spaces described later.
Theorem 4.4. Let An (n ≥0) be self-adjoint on Hn and A := ⊕∞
n=0An.
Then:
(i) The operator A is self-adjoint and
σ(A) = ∪∞
n=0σ(An).
(4.29)
Moreover, for all z ∈ρ(A), z is in ∩∞
n=0ρ(An) and
(A −z)−1 = ⊕∞
n=0(An −z)−1.
(ii) Let EAn be the spectral measure of An. Then the spectral measure EA
of A is given by
EA(B) = ⊕∞
n=0EAn(B),
B ∈B1.
(iii) For any Borel measurable function f on R,
f(A) = ⊕∞
n=0f(An)
(4.30)
(iv) The operator A is bounded from below if and only if {An}∞
n=0
is uniformly bounded from below.
In that case,
inf σ(A)
=
infn≥0(inf σ(An)).
Proof. (i) The self-adjointness of A is already proved in Theorem 4.2(vi).
Since An is self-adjoint, an application of Theorem 1.25 gives (4.15). Hence
one can apply Theorem 4.2(ii) to obtain the desired results.
(ii) Let F(B) := ⊕∞
n=0EAn(B), B ∈B1. Then, by Lemma 4.1, F(·) is
a one-dimensional spectral measure. We prove F = EA below.
For a vector Ψ ∈H, by Lemma 4.2,

By the uniqueness of the spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator, we
conclude that F = EA.

Hence f(A) = ⊕∞
n=0f(An).
(iv) The ﬁrst half of this part follows from Theorem 4.2(v). Let γ :=
inf σ(A) and let µ := infn≥0(inf σ(An)). Then, by Theorem 4.2(v) again,
An ≥γ. Hence µ ≥γ. Since γ ∈σ(A), it follows from (4.29) that there
exists an n0 ≥0 such that γ ∈σ(An0). Hence γ ≥inf σ(An0) ≥µ. Thus
we obtain γ = µ as desired.

A simple application of Theorem 4.4 is given in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.5. Let An (n ≥0) be self-adjoint on Hn.
(i) For all t ∈R,
eitA = ⊕∞
n=0eitAn.
(ii) Suppose that An ≥0, n ≥0. Then A ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+ := {z ∈
C | Re z ≥0},
e−zA = ⊕∞
n=0e−zAn.
(4.31)
Proof. (i) We need only to apply Theorem 4.4 to the case where f(λ) =
eitλ.
(ii) By Theorem 4.2(v), A ≥0. Applying Theorem 4.4 to the case where
f(λ) = e−zλχ[0,∞)(λ), we obtain (4.31).
In concluding this section, we state and prove an important theorem on
the direct sum of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 4.6. Let p ≥2 and An = (An1, . . . , Anp) (n ≥0) be a p-tuple of
strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on Hn and deﬁne
Aj := ⊕∞
n=0Anj,
j = 1, . . . , p.
Then A := (A1, . . . , Ap) is a p-tuple of strongly commuting self-adjoint
operators and
EA = ⊕∞
n=0EAn,
(4.32)
where EA and EAn are the joint spectral measures of A and An respectively.
Moreover,
σJ(A) = ∪∞
n=0σJ(An),
(4.33)
where σJ(·) denotes joint spectrum.
Proof. By Theorem 4.4(ii), we have
EAj = ⊕∞
n=0EAnj.
Hence, for all j, k = 1, . . . , p, EAj and EAk commute.
Therefore A is
strongly commuting. It is easy to see that, for all Borel sets B1, . . . , Bp ⊂R,
we have
EA(B1 × · · · × Bp) = ⊕∞
n=0EAn(B1 × · · · × Bp).
Then, by a standard argument using Hopf’s extension theorem, one obtains
(4.32).

To prove (4.33), let
Sn := σJ(An), S := σJ(A).
Then (4.33) is written S = ∪∞
n=0Sn.
Let λ ∈Sc. Then, since Sc is an open set in Rp, there exists a con-
stant δ > 0 such that Bδ(λ) := {λ′ ∈Rp| |λ′ −λ| < δ} ⊂Sc.
Hence
EA(Bδ(λ)) = 0.
Therefore, by (4.32), EAn(Bδ(λ)) = 0 for all n ≥0.
This means that Bδ(λ) ⊂Sc
n. Hence, for all n ≥0, λ ∈Sc
n, implying that
λ ∈∩∞
n=0Sc
n = (∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Hence Sc ⊂(∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Therefore ∪∞
n=0Sn ⊂S.
Thus ∪∞
n=0Sn ⊂S.
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈(∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Then there
exists a constant ε > 0 such that Bε(λ) ⊂(∪∞
n=0Sn)c.
Hence, for all
n ≥0, EAn(Bε(λ)) = 0. Hence, by (4.32), EA(Bε) = 0. This implies
that Bε(λ) ⊂Sc.
Hence λ ∈Sc.
Therefore (∪∞
n=0Sn)c ⊂Sc.
Hence
S ⊂∪∞
n=0Sn. Thus (4.33) holds.

Full Fock Spaces
Let {Hn}∞
n=1 be a sequence of Hilbert spaces and F (0) := C,
F (n) := ⊗n
j=1Hj,
n ≥1.
Then we call the inﬁnite direct sum
F := ⊕∞
n=0F (n)
of {F (n)}∞
n=0 the Fock space associated with {Hn}∞
n=1. The subspace
F (n) is called the n-particle Hilbert space of F.
In the context of
quantum physics, the Hilbert space F may be an abstract form which
describes a state space of a quantum system consisting of possibly inﬁnitely
many quantum particles.
In applications to quantum ﬁeld theory, the case where, for all n ≥1,
Hn is equal to a single Hilbert space H appears. In this case, F takes the
form
F(H ) := ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n H
with convention ⊗0H := C. This Hilbert space is called the full Fock
space over H . As is seen, the full Fock space F(H ) is constructed from
the one-particle Hilbert space H with tensor product and direct sum op-
erations.
An application of Corollary 4.1 gives the following proposition:
Proposition 4.9. If H is separable, then F(H ) is separable.

A vector Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 in F(H ) is called a ﬁnite particle vector
if there exists an n0 ∈N such that, for all n ≥n0, Ψ(n) = 0 (n0 depends
on Ψ). The set of all ﬁnite particle vectors in F(H ) is equal to
F0(H ) = b⊕
∞
n=0 ⊗n H ,
the algebraic inﬁnite direct sum of {⊗nH }∞
n=0. We call F0(H ) the ﬁnite
particle subspace of F(H ).
The vector ΩH ∈F0(H ) deﬁned by
Ω(n)
H :=

for n = 0
0
for n ≥1
(4.34)
is called the Fock vacuum in F(H ). It is a unit vector and sometimes
written as ΩH = {1, 0, 0, . . .}. As its name suggests, the vector ΩH de-
scribes the state in which no quantum particle exists.
We introduce an important subspace of the ﬁnite particle subspace. For
a subspace D of H , we deﬁne
Fﬁn(D) := b⊕
∞
n=0(b⊗
nD),
the algebraic inﬁnite direct sum of algebraic tensor products b⊗
nD (b⊗
0D :=
C). Obviously
Fﬁn(D) ⊂F0(H ) ⊂F(H ).
Lemma 4.4. Suppose that D is dense in H . Then Fﬁn(D) is dense in
F(H ).
Proof. By the present assumption and Proposition 2.1(ii), b⊗
nD is dense
in ⊗nH for all n ≥1. Hence, by Proposition 4.1(ii), Fﬁn(D) is dense in
F(H ).
Example 4.3. Let (X, Σ, µ) be a measure space and consider the case
H = L2(X, dµ), where L2(X, dµ) is assumed to be separable. For each
n ∈N, let Xn := X × · · · × X (the n-direct product space of X) and µn be
the n-product measure of µ on Xn. By Theorem 2.5, we have the natural
isomorphism ⊗nL2(X, dµ) ∼= L2(Xn, dµn). Hence
F(L2(X, dµ)) ∼= ⊕∞
n=0L2(Xn, dµn),
where L2(X0, dµ0) := C.

:
T (n) := T (n)

.
(4.35)
We set T (0) := 0 acting on C. The inﬁnite direct sum operator
dΓ(T ) := ⊕∞
n=0T (n)
of {T (n)}∞
n=0 is called the second quantization operator (or simply the
second quantization) of T . In this context, T is called a one-particle
operator.
By Proposition 3.2(ii), T
(n) = T (n) for all n ≥1. Hence
dΓ(T ) = dΓ(T),
(4.36)
i.e., the second quantization of T coincides with that of T.
Example 4.4. We consider the case where H = L2(X, dµ) as in Exam-
ple 4.3.
We denote by Un : ⊗nL2(X, dµ) →L2(Xn, dµn) (n ∈N) the
natural isomorphism (see Theorem 2.5). Namely Un is a unique unitary
transformation from ⊗nL2(X, dµ) to L2(Xn, dµn) such that
Un ⊗n
j=1 fj = f1 × · · · × fn,
f1, . . . , fn ∈L2(X, dµ).
Let F be a measurable function on X such that |F| is a.e. ﬁnite with respect
to µ. Then the multiplication operator on L2(X, dµ) by F is densely deﬁned
closed. We denote the multiplication operator by the same symbol F. We
take T to be F. Then we have

where Fj is the function on Xn deﬁned by

It follows from the deﬁnition of ΩH and dΓ(T ) that
dΓ(T )ΩH = 0.
Hence dΓ(T ) has eigenvalue 0:
0 ∈σp(dΓ(T )).
(4.37)
We now derive some general properties of dΓ(T ).
Theorem 4.7.
(i) The operator dΓ(T ) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on F(H )
and
dΓ(T ∗) ⊂dΓ(T )∗.
(4.38)
(ii) If T ̸= 0, then dΓ(T ) is unbounded.
(iii) Let D be a core for T . Then Fﬁn(D) is a core for dΓ(T ).
(iv) If T is symmetric, then so is dΓ(T ).
If T ≥0 in addition, then
dΓ(T ) ≥0.
(v) If T is symmetric and is not non-negative, then dΓ(T ) is not bounded
from below.
Proof. (i) The ﬁrst statement follows from Theorem 4.1(i) and (ii). By
Theorem 4.1(i), we have
dΓ(T )∗= ⊕∞
n=0(T (n))∗.
On the other hand, we have
T (n)∗= T (n)

Since T (n)∗is closed, taking the closure of the both sides gives T (n)∗⊃
(T ∗)(n). Hence (4.38) follows.
(ii) In the case where T is unbounded, the unboundedness of dΓ(T )
follows from Proposition 4.5.
 

Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
177
So we next consider the case where T is bounded. In this case, each T (n)
is bounded. By the assumption T ̸= 0, there exists a unit vector ψ ∈D(T )
such that T ψ ̸= 0. Let Ψ(n) = ⊗nψ. Then ∥Ψ(n)∥= 1 and
∥T (n)Ψ(n)∥2 = n(n −1)| ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩|2 + n∥T ψ∥2 ≥n∥T ψ∥2,
n ≥1.
By this estimate and the fact ∥T (n)Ψ(n)∥2 ≤∥T (n)∥2, we obtain ∥T (n)∥≥
√n∥T ψ∥. Hence supn≥1 ∥T (n)∥= ∞. Thus, by Proposition 4.4, dΓ(T ) is
unbounded.
(iii) Under the present assumption, b⊗
nD is a core for T (n) (see Propo-
sition 3.2(ii)). Hence, by Theorem 4.1(ii), Fﬁn(D) is a core for dΓ(T ).
(iv) These are due to Theorem 4.2(v).
(v) By the present assumption, there exists a vector ψ ∈D(T ) such
that ∥ψ∥= 1 and ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩< 0. In this case, for the vector Ψ(n) in (ii), we
have
D
Ψ(n), T (n)Ψ(n)E
= n ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩.
Hence, putting Ψn = {0, 0, . . ., 0, Ψ(n), 0, 0, . . .} (note that ∥Ψn∥= 1), we
obtain
⟨Ψn, dΓ(T )Ψn⟩= n ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩→−∞(n →∞).
Hence dΓ(T ) is not bounded from below.
Some basic properties of dΓ(T ) in the case where T is self-adjoint are
summarized in the next theorem.
Theorem 4.8. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then:
(i) dΓ(T ) is self-adjoint.
Moreover, if T is essentially self-adjoint on
D ⊂D(T ), then dΓ(T ) is essentially self-adjoint on Fﬁn(D).

(iv) Let p ∈N and D ⊂H be a core for T p. Then dΓ(T )p is essentially
self-adjoint on Fﬁn(D).
 

178
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) This follow from Theorem 4.2(vi).
(ii) This follows from (4.37), Theorem 4.4(i) and Theorem 3.8(i).
(iii) This follows from (4.37), Theorem 4.2(iv) and Theorem 3.12(i).
(iv) By Theorem 4.4(iii), we have
dΓ(T )p = ⊕∞
n=0(T (n))p.
It is easy to see that
(T (n))p =
X
p1+···+pn=p,pj≥0,j=1,...,n
p!
p1! · · · pn!T p1 ⊗· · · ⊗T pn
on b⊗
nD. Hence, by applying Theorem 3.10(ii), (T (n))p is essentially self-
adjoint on b⊗
nD.
Thus, by Theorem 4.2(vi), dΓ(T )p is essentially self-
adjoint on Fﬁn(D).
In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, dΓ(T ) may have the following
meaning. Suppose that T is a self-adjoint operator which denotes a physical
quantity in a one-particle quantum system (e.g., the Hamiltonian). Then
T (n) represents the same kind of physical quantity in the corresponding
n-particle quantum system. Hence dΓ(T ) gives the same kind of physical
quantity in the corresponding inﬁnite quantum particle system in which
any number of quantum particles may exist.
The second quantization operator for the identity I on H
b
N := dΓ(I)
(4.39)
is called the number operator on F(H ). This name comes from the fact
that
b
N ↾H (n) = n,
n ≥0,
the scalar multiplication operator by n. Since I is self-adjoint, b
N is self-
adjoint by Theorem 4.8(i). By Theorem 4.8(iii) applied to the case T = I,
one has
σ( b
N) = σp( b
N) = {0} ∪N
(4.40)
with
ker( b
N −n) = ⊗nH ,
n ≥0.
(4.41)
In particular, b
N ≥0. Namely, b
N is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.

Γ-operators
Let K be a Hilbert space and S be a densely deﬁned closable operator
from H to K . Then the n-fold tensor product ⊗nS of S (⊗1S := S) is
a densely deﬁned closed operator from ⊗nH to ⊗nK (see Remark 3.5).
Hence, by Theorem 4.1(i) and (ii), the inﬁnite direct sum operator
Γ(S) := ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n S
(4.42)
with ⊗0S := 1 : C →C is a densely deﬁned closed operator from F(H )
to F(K ). We call the operator Γ(S) the Γ-operator for S.4 By (3.9), we
have
Γ(S) = Γ(S).
We ﬁrst note the following fact:
Proposition 4.10. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators from
H to K . If Γ(S) = Γ(T ), then S = T.
Proof. For any ψ ∈D(S), let Ψ ∈F(H ) be deﬁned by Ψ(1) = ψ
and Ψ(n) = 0 for n ̸= 1.
Then Ψ ∈D(Γ(S)) and (Γ(S)Ψ)(1) = Sψ,
(Γ(S)Ψ)(n) = 0, n ̸= 1. By the present assumption, Ψ ∈D(Γ(T )). Hence
ψ ∈D(T ) and (Γ(T )Ψ)(1) = Tψ, (Γ(T )Ψ)(n) = 0, n ̸= 1.
Therefore
Sψ = Tψ. Thus S ⊂T. By symmetry, we have T ⊂S. Thus S = T.
Remark 4.4. The correspondence Γ(·) : S 7→Γ(S) deﬁnes a mapping
from the set of densely deﬁned closed operators from H to K to the set of
densely deﬁned closed operators from F(H ) to F(K ). Proposition 4.10
shows that this mapping is injective.
With regard to boundedness or unboundedness of a Γ-operator, the fol-
lowing theorem holds. Note the diﬀerence from those of the second quan-
tization dΓ(·).
Theorem 4.9. Let S be a densely deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
(i) If S is unbounded or bounded with ∥S∥> 1, then Γ(S) is unbounded.
(ii) If S is a contraction operator, then so is Γ(S).
4Usually Γ(S) is considered only for the case where S is a contraction operator and
there are cases where Γ(S) is called the second quantization of S (e.g., [Mayer (1995),
§4.1]). But, in the present book, we use the word “second quantization” only for dΓ(·).
In [Arai (2000a)], Γ(S) is called the second quantization of the second kind.
 

180
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) Let S be unbounded. Then ⊗1S = S is unbounded. Hence, by
Proposition 4.5, Γ(S) is unbounded.
Next let S be bounded. Then ⊗nS is bounded for all n ≥1 with
∥⊗n S∥= ∥S∥n.
(4.43)
The present assumption ∥S∥> 1 implies that supn≥1 ∥S∥n = ∞. Hence
supn≥1 ∥⊗n S∥= ∞. Thus, by Proposition 4.4, Γ(S) is unbounded.
(ii) If ∥S∥≤1, then, by (4.43), ∥⊗n S∥≤1. Hence, by Proposition 4.4,
∥Γ(S)∥≤1.
The next theorem is about the adjoint of Γ(S).
Theorem 4.10. Let S be as in Theorem 4.9.
(i) Γ(S∗) ⊂Γ(S)∗.
(ii) If S is a contraction operator, then Γ(S)∗= Γ(S∗).
(iii) If D is a core for S, then b⊕
∞
n=0 ˆ⊗
nD is a core for Γ(S).
Proof. (i) Since S is densely deﬁned closable, S∗is a densely deﬁned closed
operator. Hence one can deﬁne Γ(S∗). Let Ψ ∈D(Γ(S)) and Φ ∈D(Γ(S∗)).
Then Φ(n) ∈D(⊗nS∗) for all n ≥0 and P∞
n=0 ∥(⊗nS∗)Φ(n)∥2 < ∞. Recall
that ⊗nS∗⊂(⊗nS)∗. Hence
⟨Φ, Γ(S)Ψ⟩=
∞
X
n=0
D
(⊗nS∗)Φ(n), Ψ(n)E
= ⟨Γ(S∗)Φ, Ψ⟩.
Therefore, Φ ∈D(Γ(S)∗) and Γ(S)∗Φ = Γ(S∗)Φ. Thus Γ(S∗) ⊂Γ(S)∗.
(ii) Under the present assumption, S∗is a contraction operator. Hence,
by Theorem 4.9(ii), Γ(S∗) is a contraction operator from F(K ) to F(H )
with D(Γ(S∗)) = F(K ). Thus, by (i), Γ(S∗) = Γ(S)∗.
(iii) By Proposition 3.1(i), ˆ⊗
nD is a core for ⊗nS. Hence, by Theorem
4.1(ii), b⊕
∞
n=0 ˆ⊗
nD is a core for Γ(S).
Fundamental properties of Γ(S) are summarized in the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.11. Let S be as above.
(i) If H = K and S is self-adjoint, then Γ(S) is self-adjoint.
(ii) (product law) If S ∈B(H , K ) is a contraction operator and S′ is a
contraction operator from K to a Hilbert space M , then
Γ(S′S) = Γ(S′)Γ(S).
(4.44)

(iii) If U : H
→K is unitary, then Γ(U) is a unitary operator from
F(H ) to F(K ) and
Γ(U)−1 = Γ(U −1).
(4.45)
Moreover,
Γ(U)Fﬁn(H ) = Fﬁn(K ).
(4.46)
(iv) If S, SN (N ∈N) are contraction operators from H
to K
and
s- limN→∞SN = S, then
s- lim
N→∞Γ(SN) = Γ(S).
(v) Let H = K and M be a closed subspace of H . Let PM be the or-
thogonal projection onto M . Then Γ(PM) is the orthogonal projection
onto F(M ) ⊂F(H ).
Proof. (i) Under the present assumption, ⊗nS is self-adjoint. Hence, by
Theorem 4.4(i), Γ(S) is self-adjoint.
(ii) Under the present assumption, Γ(S) and Γ(S′) are contraction op-
erators by Theorem 4.9(ii). Since S′S is contraction operator, Γ(S′S) is a
contraction operator. It is easy to see that (4.44) holds on Fﬁn(H ). By
this fact and the density of Fﬁn(H ), operator equality (4.44) follows (an
application of Theorem 1.2).
(iii) If U is unitary, then ⊗nU is unitary. Hence, by Theorem 4.1(iii),
Γ(U) is unitary. By (4.44), we have Γ(IK ) = Γ(UU −1) = Γ(U)Γ(U −1). It
is obvious that Γ(IK ) = IF(K ). Hence (4.45) holds.
Relation (4.46) immediately follows from the deﬁnition of Γ(S).
(iv) One needs only to apply Proposition 4.6 with An = ⊗nS, An,N =
⊗nSN.
(v) By (i) and (ii), Γ(PM ) is an orthogonal projection. It is easy to see
that, for each n ≥1, (⊗nPM )(⊗nH ) = ⊗nM . Hence Γ(PM )F(H ) =
F(M ).
Theorem 4.11 tells us that the operator Γ(U) with U : H →K unitary
is a natural isomorphism between F(H ) and F(K ).

Anti-unitary Γ-operators
A mapping W : H →K is called an anti-unitary operator if W is
anti-linear, RanW = K and ∥Wψ∥= ∥ψ∥for all ψ ∈H .
 

182
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let W : H →K be anti-unitary. Then, using the polarization identity,
one can show that
⟨Wψ, Wφ⟩= ⟨φ, ψ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H .
In the same way as in the case of bounded linear operators, one can show
that, for each n ∈N, there exists a unique anti-unitary operator ⊗nW from
⊗nH to ⊗nK such that
(⊗nW)(⊗n
j=1ψj) = ⊗n
j=1Wψj,
ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n.
We call ⊗nW the n-fold tensor product of W.
Let JC : C →C be the complex conjugation:
JCz := z∗,
z ∈C
and
Γ(W) := JC ⊕(⊕∞
n=1 ⊗n W) .
Then it is easy to see that Γ(W) is an anti-unitary operator from F(H )
to F(K ).
4.10
Representations of Unitary Groups and Semi-groups
Let U(H ) be the set of all unitary operators on a Hilbert space H . Then
it is easy to see that U(H ) is a group with respect to the product operation
of operators. The group U(H ) is called the unitary group on H .
Theorem 4.12. Let U0 be a subgroup of U(H ). Then the mapping Γ(·):
U0 ∋U 7→Γ(U) ∈U(F(H )) gives a faithful unitary representation of U0
on F(H ). Moreover, Γ(·) is strongly continuous.
Proof. The ﬁrst half of this theorem follows from Theorem 4.11(ii), (iii)
and Remark 4.4. The second half is due to Theorem 4.11(iv).
Theorem 4.12 is used for unitary representations of groups appearing in
quantum ﬁeld theory in the following form.
Corollary 4.3. Let G be a group and ρ : G →U(H ) be a unitary represen-
tation. Then {Γ(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a unitary representation of G on F(H ).
In particular, if G is a topological space and ρ is strongly continuous, then
{Γ(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a strongly continuous unitary representation.
 

Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
183
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 4.12 to the case where U0 =
{ρ(g)|g ∈G}.
For a Hilbert space H , we denote by Con(H ) the set of all contraction
operators on H . It is easy to see that Con(H ) is a unitary semi-group
(see Subsection 2.9.2).
Theorem 4.13. Let B be a subsemi-group of Con(H ). Then {Γ(C)|C ∈
B} is a subsemi-group of Con(F(H )).
Proof. Let C1, C2 ∈B. Then, by Theorem 4.11 (ii), Γ(Cj) (j = 1, 2) is a
contraction operator and Γ(C1C2) = Γ(C1)Γ(C2). Thus the desired result
follows.
4.11
Relations Between Γ(·) and dΓ(·)
There is an interesting relation between Γ(·) and dΓ(·):
Theorem 4.14. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H .
(i) For all t ∈R,
Γ(eitT ) = eitdΓ(T ).
(4.47)
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓ(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+ (see (1.32)),
Γ(e−zT ) = e−zdΓ(T ).
(4.48)
Proof. (i) By Theorem 4.5(i), we have for all t ∈R
eitdΓ(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0eitT (n).
On the other hand, by Theorem 3.8(v),
eitT (n) = ⊗neitT ,
t ∈R.
Hence (4.47) follows.
(ii) Let T ≥0. Then, by Theorem 3.8(iv), T (n) ≥0, n ≥0. Hence, by
Theorem 4.5(ii), dΓ(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+,
e−zdΓ(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0e−zT (n).
On the other hand, by Theorem 3.14, we have
e−zT (n) = ⊗ne−zT ,
z ∈C+.
Hence (4.48) follows.

Remark 4.5. See Problem 10 for some aspects related to Theorem 4.14.
One has the following theorem on the transformation law of dΓ(T ) under
the unitary operator Γ(U) with U : H →K unitary:
Theorem 4.15. Let U be a unitary operator from H to K and T be a
self-adjoint operator on H . Then
Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = dΓ(UT U −1).
(4.49)
Proof. Since Γ(U) is unitary, Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 is a self-adjoint operator
on F(K ). Let t ∈R be arbitrary. Then, using the unitary covariance
of functional calculus (Theorem 1.24), (4.47) and the product law of the
Γ-operation, we can proceed as follows:
eitΓ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = Γ(U)eitdΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = Γ(UeitT U −1) = Γ(eitUT U−1)
= eitdΓ(UT U−1).
Hence (4.49) holds.
Remark 4.6. For Hilbert spaces H and K , we denote by Con(H , K )
the set of all contraction operators from H to K . Let H be the class of
all Hilbert spaces and C := {S ∈Con(H , K )|H , K ∈H}, the class of all
contraction operators from a Hilbert space to a Hilbert space. Then the pair
Hilbert(C) := (H, C) forms a category whose class of objects and of arrows
(morphisms) are H and C respectively.5 One can also consider the category
whose objects and arrows are respectively full Fock spaces and contraction
operators from a full Fock space to a full Fock space. We denote it by
Fock(C). Then it follows from Theorem 4.11(ii) that the correspondence
eΓ : Hilbert(C) →Fock(C) deﬁned by
eΓ(H , S) := (F(H ), Γ(S)),
(H , S) ∈Hilbert(C)
is a covariant functor. Hence the Γ-operator Γ(·) in its extended form eΓ(·)
is a convariant functor from a Hilbert space category Hilbert(C) to a full
Fock space category Fock(C).
By Theorem 4.14, the operator family {Γ(eitT )}t∈R with a self-adjoint
operator T is equal to the strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group
{eitdΓ(T )}t∈R generated by dΓ(T ). Hence Γ(eitT ) is an integrated form of

[Awodey (2010)].

the second quantization dΓ(T ) in the sense that, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓ(T )),
Ψ(t) = Γ(eitT )Ψ is a unique solution to the strong diﬀerential equation
dΨ(t)
dt
= idΓ(T )Ψ(t).
In this sense, it may be possible to regard Γ(eitT ) as a bounded operator
version of the second quantization of T . Thus, conceptually, the second
quantization may be understood as the functor eΓ(·) with arrows restricted
to {eitT |t ∈R, T is a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space}.
Theorem 4.15 extends to the case where T is a densely deﬁned closable
operator.
Theorem 4.16. Let U be a unitary operator from H to K and T be a
densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then
Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = dΓ(UT U −1).
(4.50)
Proof. Let S := UT U −1. Then, by direct computations, one has for all
n ≥1
S(n)
0
= (⊗nU)T (n)
0
(⊗nU −1)
on ˆ⊗
nD(S).
Hence
S(n)
0
⊂(⊗nU)T (n)
0
(⊗nU −1) ⊂(⊗nU)T (n)(⊗nU −1)
= Γ(U)(n)dΓ(T )(n)Γ(U −1)(n).
Therefore
S(n) ⊂Γ(U)(n)dΓ(T )(n)Γ(U −1)(n).
This implies that
dΓ(UT U −1) = dΓ(S) ⊂Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U −1) = Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1.
Since this relation holds for any densely deﬁned closable operator T and
any unitary operator U : H →K , one can take (UT U −1, U −1) as (T, U)
(note that UT U −1 is a densely deﬁned closable operator from K to H )
to obtain dΓ(T ) ⊂Γ(U)−1dΓ(UT U −1)Γ(U). Hence, by Proposition 1.1,
Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 ⊂dΓ(UT U −1). Thus (4.50) follows.

Commutation Properties of Second Quantization
Operators
Theorem 4.17. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
such that the commutator [S, T ] is densely deﬁned and closable. Then
Fﬁn(D([S, T ])) ⊂D([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )])
(4.51)
and
[dΓ(S), dΓ(T )] = dΓ([S, T ]) on Fﬁn(D([S, T ])).
(4.52)
Proof. We take a vector Ψ ∈Fﬁn(D([S, T ])) such that
Ψ(n) = ⊗n
j=1Ψj, n ≥1,
Ψj ∈D([S, T ]),
j = 1, . . . , n.
Then Ψ(n) ∈D([S(n), T (n)]) and hence Ψ ∈D([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )]) with
([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )]Ψ)(n) = [S(n), T (n)]Ψ(n).
Using the deﬁnition of S(n) and T (n), we have
S(n)T (n)Ψ(n) =
n
X
j̸=k
Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗SΨj ⊗· · · ⊗T Ψk ⊗· · · ⊗Ψn
+
n
X
j=1
Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ST Ψj ⊗· · · ⊗Ψn.
By symmetry, T (n)S(n)Ψ(n) is given by the right hand side with S and T
interchanged. Hence it follows that
[S(n), T (n)]Ψ(n) = [S, T ](n)Ψ(n) = (dΓ([S, T ])Ψ)(n).
Thus (4.52) holds.
To see a meaning of commutation relation (4.52), we recall some alge-
braic concepts. Let K be R or C. A vector space g over K is called a Lie
algebra over K if there is a mapping [ , ] : g × g →g ((X, Y ) ∈g × g 7→
[X, Y ] ∈g) satisfying the following (i)–(iii):
(i) (linearity) [aX + bY, Z] = a[X, Z] + b[Y, Z], X, Y ∈g, a, b ∈K,
(ii) (anti-symmetry) [X, Y ] = −[Y, X], X, Y ∈g.
(iii) (Jacobi identiy) [X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y ]] = 0, X, Y, Z ∈g.
 

Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
187
If K = R (resp. C), then g is called a real (resp. complex) Lie algebra.
The mapping [ , ] : g×g →g is called a bracket product or Lie bracket.
A subset h of a Lie algebra g is called a subalgebra of g if it is a vector
subspace of g and, for all X, Y ∈h, [X, Y ] ∈h. In that case, h is a Lie
algebra.
Example 4.5. For a vector space V over K, we denote by gl(V ) the set of
all everywhere deﬁned linear operators on V (note that gl(V ) ⊂L(V )). It
is easy to see that gl(V ) is a Lie algebra over K with the bracket product
given by the commutator [X, Y ] := XY −Y X, X, Y ∈gl(V ).
In particular, for a Hilbert space H , the set B(H ) of all everywhere
deﬁned bounded linear operators on H is a Lie algebra with the bracket
product being the commutator. This Lie algebra is a sub-algebra of the Lie
algebra gl(H ).
For Lie algebras g and h over K, a linear operator f : g →h is called a
homomorphism from g to h if, for all X, Y ∈g, f([X, Y ]) = [f(X), f(Y )]
(i.e., f preserves the Lie algebraic structure). A bijective homomorphism
f : g →h is called an isomorphism. The Lie algebras g and h are said to
be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism f : g →h.
A homomorphism ̺ from a Lie algebra g to gl(V ) (i.e., for all X, Y ∈
g, a, b ∈K, ̺(X) ∈gl(V ), ̺(aX + bY ) = a̺(X) + b̺(Y ) and ̺([X, Y ]) =
[̺(X), ̺(Y )]) is called a representation of g on V . In this case, V is called
the representation space of ̺.
If V is a subspace of a Hilbert space H , then ̺ is called a Hilbert
space representation of g in H . If, for all X ∈g, ̺(X) is bounded,
then ̺ is called a bounded representation of g in H . A Hilbert space
representation of g which is not bounded is said to be unbounded.
Now let us come back to Theorem 4.17. Note that, for all S ∈B(H ),
dΓ(S) can be regarded as an everywhere deﬁned linear operator on the
vector space Fﬁn(H ). Namely dΓ(S) ∈gl(Fﬁn(H )). Therefore Theorem
4.17 means that the mapping dΓ(·) : B(H ) →gl(Fﬁn(H )) gives a Hilbert
space representation of the Lie algebra B(H ) on Fﬁn(H ). By Theorem
4.7(ii), this representation is unbounded.
Corollary 4.4. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on H .
(i) If S and T commute on a subspace D ⊂D(ST ) ∩D(T S), then
Fﬁn(D) ⊂D([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )])
(4.53)
and dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) commute on Fﬁn(D):
[dΓ(S), dΓ(T )] = 0 on Fﬁn(D).
(4.54)

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) Let b
N be the number operator deﬁned by (4.39). Then Fﬁn(D(T )) ⊂
D([ b
N, dΓ(T )]) and
[ b
N, dΓ(T )]Ψ = 0 on Fﬁn(D(T )).
(4.55)
Proof. (i) This follows from the proof of Theorem 4.17.
(ii) One needs only to apply (i) to the case where S = I and D =
D(T ) = D([I, T ]).
In the case where S and T are self-adjoint, dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) are self-
adjoint (Theorem 4.8). Hence one can ask when they commute strongly.
One should be careful about the following point: by Corollary 4.4, if S
and T commute, then dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) commute on Fﬁn(D([S, T ])). But,
dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) do not necessarily strongly commute.
With regard to the strong commutativity of dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ), the fol-
lowing beautiful fact exists:
Theorem 4.18. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H . Then the
self-adjoint operators dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) strongly commute if and only if S
and T strongly commute.
Proof. Let s, t ∈R be arbitrarily ﬁxed. Then, by (4.47) and (4.44), we
have
eis dΓ(S)eit dΓ(T ) = Γ(eisSeitT ),
s, t ∈R.
(4.56)
Suppose that dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) strongly commute. Then, by Proposition
1.36, for all s, t ∈R, eis dΓ(S) and eit dΓ(T ) commute. By this fact and (4.56),
Γ
 eisSeitT 
= Γ
 eitT eisS
.
Restricting this equation to H as a closed
subspace of F(H ), we obtain eisSeitT = eitT eisS. Hence, by Proposition
1.36 again, we conclude that S and T strongly commute.
Conversely, suppose that S and T strongly commute. Then, by Proposi-
tion 1.36 and (4.56), eis dΓ(S) and eit dΓ(T ) commute. Hence, by Proposition
1.36 again, dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) strongly commute.
A special case of Theorem 4.18 takes the following form:
Corollary 4.5. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, b
N and dΓ(T )
strongly commute.
Proof. It is easy to see that I and T strongly commute. Hence, by (4.39)
and Theorem 4.18, the desired result holds.

Creation and Annihilation Operators
Besides second quantization operators and Γ-operators, there are important
classes of linear operators on F(H ).
For each f ∈H and n ≥0, we deﬁne a mapping cn,+(f) : ⊗nH →
⊗n+1H by
cn,+(f)ψ := f ⊗ψ,
ψ ∈⊗nH .
(4.57)
It is easy to see that cn,+(f) is a bounded linear operator with
∥cn,+(f)∥= ∥f∥
and its adjoint cn,+(f)∗: ⊗n+1H →⊗nH satisﬁes
cn,+(f)∗⊗n+1
j=1 ψj = ⟨f, ψ1⟩⊗n+1
j=2 ψj,
ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n + 1.
(4.58)
For each f ∈H and a complex sequence α := {αn}∞
n=0 (αn ∈C, n ≥0),
one can deﬁne a linear operator ℓ+(f) on F(H ) as follows:
D(ℓ+(f)) =
(
Ψ ∈F(H )

∞
X
n=1
|αn|2∥Ψ(n−1)∥2 < ∞
)
,
(ℓ+(f)Ψ)(0) = 0,
(ℓ+(f)Ψ)(n) = αncn−1,+(f)Ψ(n−1), n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(ℓ+(f)).
This is an example of the non-diagonal operator A+ introduced in Subsec-
tion 4.4.1: in the present case, Hn = ⊗nH and A(n−1)
+
= αncn−1,+(f), n ≥
1. It follows that ℓ+(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on F(H ) with
Fﬁn(H ) ⊂D(ℓ+(f)). The operator ℓ+(f) is called the creation operator
with test vector f. The adjoint of ℓ+(f)
ℓ(f) := ℓ+(f)∗
is called the annihilation operator with test vector f. By the closed-
ness of ℓ+(f),
ℓ+(f) = ℓ(f)∗.
Henceforth we use ℓ(f)∗instead of ℓ+(f).
It follows from Theorem 4.3 that
D(ℓ(f)) =
(
Ψ ∈F(H ) |

|αn+1|2∥cn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1)∥2 < ∞

(ℓ(f)Ψ)(n) = α∗
n+1cn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1),
n ≥0.

By (4.58), one has for any vector Ψ ∈F(H ) of the form Ψ(m) =
δm,n+1 ⊗n+1
j=1 fj with fj ∈H (m ≥0)
(ℓ(f)Ψ)(m) = δm,nα∗
n+1 ⟨f, ψ1⟩⊗n+1
j=2 ψj,
m ≥0.
(4.59)
With regard to boundedness or unboundedness of ℓ(f), one has the
following proposition:
Proposition 4.11. Let f ∈H .
(i) If ∥α∥∞:= supn≥0 |αn| < ∞, then ℓ(f) is in B(F(H )) and
∥ℓ(f)∥= ∥α∥∞∥f∥.
(4.60)
(ii) If supn≥0 |αn| = ∞and f ̸= 0, then both ℓ(f) and ℓ(f)∗are unbounded.
Proof. (i) The boundedness of ℓ(f) with ∥ℓ(f)∥≤∥α∥∞∥f∥follows from
Theorem 4.3(iii). To prove (4.60), we need only to show that ∥ℓ(f)∥≥
∥α∥∞∥f∥. There is a sequence {n(k)}k (n(k) ∈N) such that |αn(k)| →
∥α∥∞(k →∞). Let ψf := ⊗n(k)f/∥f∥n(k) ∈⊗n(k)H and deﬁne Ψk ∈
Fﬁn(H ) by Ψ(n)
k
:= 0, n ̸= n(k) and Ψ(n(k))
k
:= ψf. Then ∥Ψk∥= 1 and
(ℓ(f)Ψk)(n) = 0,
n ̸= n(k) −1,
(ℓ(f)Ψk)(n(k)−1) = α∗
n(k)(∥f∥−n(k)∥f∥2) ⊗n(k)−1 f.
Hence
∥ℓ(f)∥≥∥ℓ(f)Ψk∥= |αn(k)| ∥f∥.
Taking k →∞, we obtain ∥ℓ(f)∥≥∥α∥∞∥f∥.
(ii) In the present case, there exists a subsequence {αn(k)}k such that
|αn(k)| →∞(k →∞). Let Ψk be as in (i). Then |αn(k)| ∥f∥≤∥ℓ(f)Ψk∥.
Hence ∥ℓ(f)Ψk∥→∞(k →∞).
Thus ℓ(f) is unbounded.
Then the
unboundedness of ℓ(f)∗follows from a general fact (Proposition 1.7).
For vectors f, g ∈H , we deﬁne a mapping If,g on H by
If,g(ψ) := ⟨g, ψ⟩f,
ψ ∈H .
(4.61)
Lemma 4.5. For all f, g ∈H , If,g is a bounded linear operator on H

The proof of this lemma is easy and hence left as an exercise (Problem
8).
Theorem 4.19. Let f, g ∈H . Then, for all Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)),
(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)Ψ)(0) = 0,

and, for all Ψ ∈D(ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗),

n ≥0.
(4.64)
Proof. For all Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)), (ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)Ψ)(0) = 0 and
(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)Ψ)(n) = |αn|2cn−1,+(f)cn−1,+(g)∗Ψ(n),
n ≥1.
By considering the case where Ψ(n) = ⊗n
j=1ψj with ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n
ﬁrst and then by a limiting argument, one can prove the operator equality

Hence (4.63) follows.
Let Ψ ∈D(ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗). Then
(ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = |αn+1|2cn,+(g)∗cn,+(f)Ψ(n),
n ≥0.
It is easy to see that
cn,+(g)∗cn,+(f) = ⟨g, f⟩.
Hence (4.64) holds.
Example 4.6.
(i) A simple case for α is given by the case where αn = 1, n ≥0. Then,
for all f ∈H , ℓ(f) is bounded and ∥ℓ(f)∥= ∥f∥. Moreover, for all

ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗= ⟨g, f⟩( b

where b

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Finally we derive commutation relations of ℓ(f)∗and ℓ(f) with the
second quantization dΓ(·).
Theorem 4.20. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H , f ∈
D(T ) and g ∈D(T ∗). Then
[dΓ(T ), ℓ(f)∗] = ℓ(T f)∗
on Fﬁn(D(T )),
(4.65)
[dΓ(T ), ℓ(g)] = −ℓ(T ∗g)
on Fﬁn(D(T )).
(4.66)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fﬁn(D(T )).
Then (dΓ(T )ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(0) = 0 and, for all
n ≥1,
(dΓ(T )ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = T (n)
0
(αnf ⊗Ψ(n−1))
= αnT f ⊗Ψ(n−1) + αnf ⊗(dΓ(T )Ψ)(n−1)
= (ℓ(T f)∗Ψ)(n) + (ℓ(f)∗dΓ(T )Ψ)(n).
Hence (4.65) holds.
Replacing T by T ∗in (4.65), we have [dΓ(T ∗), ℓ(g)∗] = ℓ(T ∗g)∗on
Fﬁn(D(T ∗)). Hence, for all Φ ∈Fﬁn(D(T ∗)) and Ψ ∈Fﬁn(D(T )), we
have
⟨Ψ, [dΓ(T ∗), ℓ(g)∗]Φ⟩= ⟨Ψ, ℓ(T ∗g)∗Φ⟩= ⟨ℓ(T ∗g)Ψ, Φ⟩.
It is easy to see that the left hand side is equal to ⟨[ℓ(g), dΓ(T )]Ψ, Φ⟩. Hence
[ℓ(g), dΓ(T )]Ψ = ℓ(T ∗g)Ψ. Thus (4.66) follows.
It may be remarkable that commutation relations (4.65) and (4.66) are
independent of the choice of the sequence α.

Chapter 5
Boson Fock Spaces
There is an important closed subspace of the full Fock space F(H ) over a Hilbert
space H , called the boson Fock space over H .
In this chapter, we describe
basic aspects of the theory of boson Fock spaces.
This theory is a basis for
mathematically rigorous constructions of models in a class of quantum ﬁelds,
called Bose ﬁelds.
5.1
Introduction—Some Physical Backgrounds
A big diﬀerence between classical particles and quantum particles (elemen-
tary particles, atoms, molecules, ions etc.) is that identical quantum parti-
cles (e.g., two electrons) are indistinguishable (e.g., [Dirac (1958), Chapter
IX]). This fact is called the principle of indistinguishability. It brings
some restrictions on the form of states of a many-body system consisting
of identical quantum particles.
To be concrete, let us consider a system S of N identical quantum par-
ticles with N ≥2 (e.g., N electrons).
Then one can show (e.g., [Arai
and Ezawa (1999b), §4.1]) that the principle of indistinguishability im-
plies the following alternative on the states of the system: any state of
the system S is either symmetric or anti-symmetric for all permutations
of the N identical quantum particles. A quantum particle is said to obey
the Bose-Einstein (resp. Fermi-Dirac) statistics if its many particle
systems allow only symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric) states and called a
boson (resp. fermion). Thus there are two classes of quantum particles
in nature. For example, electrons and protons are fermions, while photons
and mesons are bosons.
As is easily inferred, a Hilbert space of states for the system S may take
a diﬀerent form according to whether the quantum particles are identical
195

bosons or fermions. If a Hilbert space of states for a one-boson (resp. one-
fermion) system is H , then a natural Hilbert space of states for a system
of N identical bosons (resp. fermions) is given by the symmetric tensor
product ⊗N
s H (resp. the anti-symmetric tensor product ∧N(H )).
As is well known, elementary particles can be created or annihilated
through interactions. A quantum ﬁeld is supposed to be an object with
which one kind of elementary particles (quanta) is associated and that has
the function creating or annihilating the associated elementary particles
without restriction on their number. Hence, in the particle picture, the
system of a quantum ﬁeld is essentially an inﬁnite particle system. There-
fore a Hilbert space of states for a quantum ﬁeld system must contain
vectors representing states of n identical elementary particles with n ≥0
arbitrary.
A quantum ﬁeld whose quanta are bosons ( resp. fermions) is called a
Bose (resp. Fermi) ﬁeld. A boson Fock space, the main object in this
chapter, is used to describe a Hilbert space of states for the system of a
Bose ﬁeld. On the other hand, a Hilbert space of states for the system of a
Fermi ﬁeld is given by a fermion Fock space discussed in the next chapter.
In connection with these facts, we want to mention the following as-
pect: a quantum particle carries a physical quantity called a spin angular
momentum s = (s1, s2, s3), where s1, s2 and s3 are linear operators on a
Hilbert space. This quantity is related to an internal degree of freedom.1
In a physical picture, the spin angular momentum of a quantum particle
is supposed to be the angular momentum of “internal rotation”. The total
angular momentum of a quantum particle is given by the sum of the spin
angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum.
A number s ∈{n/2 | n ∈{0} ∪N}—an integer (0, 1, 2, . . .) or a half-
integer (1/2, 3/2, . . .)—is associated with each quantum particle in such a
way that the eigenvalue of s2 is equal to s(s + 1)ℏ2, where ℏis the reduced
Planck constant. The number s is called the spin of the quantum particle
under consideration. In this case, the quantum particle is said to have spin
s.
For example, an electron and a proton have spin 1/2. The spin of a
photon is 1. A π meson and a K meson have spin 0.
If the mass of a quantum particle with spin s is positive, then the
quantum particle has exactly (2s+1) spin eigenstates which are represented
by eigenvectors of sj with eigenvalues −sℏ, (−s+1)ℏ, . . ., (s−1)ℏ, sℏ. But,
1A degree of freedom independent of external (spatial) degrees of freedom.
 

Boson Fock Spaces

for elementary particles with mass zero, this is not true. For example, a
photon, whose spin is 1, has only two spin eigenstates with eigenvalues
±ℏ; theoretically this is due to relativistic and gauge invariance (see, e.g.,
[Takeda and Miyazawa (1974), §6.1] for details).
In general, a quantum particle with an integer spin obeys the Bose-
Einstein statistics, i.e., it is a boson, while a quantum particle with a half-
integer spin obeys the Fermi-Dirac statistics, i.e., it is a fermion. This ex-
perimentally established fact is called the relation of spin and statistics.
Theoretically this can be derived from an axiomatic relativistic quantum
ﬁeld theory (e.g., [Bogoliubov et al. (1975)], [Haag (1996)]).
5.2
The Boson Fock Space over a Hilbert Space
Let H be a Hilbert space. Then, for each n ∈N, one has the n-fold sym-
metric tensor product Hilbert space ⊗n
s H (see Section 2.9). The inﬁnite
direct sum Hilbert space
Fb(H ) :=
∞
M
n=0
⊗n
s H
is called the boson (or symmetric) Fock space over H . Since ⊗n
s H is
a closed subspace of ⊗nH , Fb(H ) can be regarded as a closed subspace
of the full Fock space F(H ) in the natural way.
Let Sn be the symmetrization operator on ⊗nH (see Section 2.9) and
deﬁne an operator Pb(H ) on the full Fock space F(H ) by
Pb(H ) :=
∞
M
n=0
Sn.
Then, by Theorem 4.2(vii), Pb(H ) is the orthogonal projection onto
Fb(H ):
Pb(H )F(H ) = Fb(H ).
For a subspace D of H , we introduce
Fb,ﬁn(D) := Pb(H )Fﬁn(D) = b⊕
∞
n=0Sn(ˆ⊗
nD).
(5.1)
In the context of Bose ﬁeld theories, the Hilbert space ⊗n
s H as a closed
subspace of Fb(H ) represents the state vector space of a system of n
identical bosons. For this reason, ⊗n
s H is called an n-boson space.
With regard to a CONS of Fb(H ), we have the following fact:
Proposition 5.1. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of H and E (n)
sym (n ∈N) be the
set deﬁned by (2.50) with N = n. Let ΩH be the Fock vacuum (see (4.34)).
 

198
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then {ΩH }∪
h
∪∞
n=1E (n)
sym
i
is a CONS of Fb(H ), where we use the natural
identiﬁcation of ⊗n
s H with ^
⊗ns H ⊂Fb(H ) (see Section 4.1).
Proof. This follows from an application of Propositions 2.9 and 4.2.
Example 5.1. One of the simplest examples of boson Fock space is Fb(C),
the boson Fock space over C. Since ⊗n
s C ∼= C, we have
Fb(C) ∼= ⊕∞
n=0C = ℓ2({0} ∪N).
Example 5.2. Let (X, Σ, µ), Xn and µn be as in Example 4.3 and con-
sider the case H = L2(X, dµ).
Then, for each n ≥1, ⊗n
s L2(X, dµ) is
isomorphic to L2
sym(Xn, dµn) under the unitary transformation U sym
X,n de-
ﬁned in Subsection 2.10.1. We deﬁne U sym
X,0 : C →C by U sym
X,0 = 1 and put
L2
sym(X0, dµ0) := C. Then, by Theorem 4.1(iii), the inﬁnite direct sum
operator
U sym
X
:= ⊕∞
n=0U sym
X,n
is a unitary operator from Fb(L2(X, dµ)) to ⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dµn). Hence
the boson Fock space Fb(L2(X, dµ)) over L2(X, dµ) is isomorphic to
⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dµn) under U sym
X
.
We call this isomorphism the natural
isomorphism between Fb(L2(X, dµ)) and ⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dµn) and write
Fb(L2(X, dµ)) ∼= ⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dµn).

5.3
Boson Second Quantization Operators
In Chapter 4, we discussed second quantization operators acting on the full
Fock space F(H ). It is natural to consider the restriction of them to the
boson Fock space Fb(H ).
5.3.1
Reduction of a class of tensor product operators
As a preliminary, we ﬁrst discuss the reduction of a class of operators on
the n-particle space ⊗nH to ⊗n
s H .
Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
Proposition 5.2. For all n ≥2, the operator T (n) deﬁned by (4.35) is
reduced by ⊗n
s H .
 

Boson Fock Spaces
199
Proof. We ﬁrst recall that the orthogonal projection from ⊗nH
onto
⊗n
s H is the symmetrization operator Sn. Let Ψ ∈D(T (n)) ⊂⊗nH . By
the deﬁnition of tensor product of linear operators, there exists a sequence
{ΨN}N in b⊗
nD(T ) such that ΨN →Ψ, T (n)ΨN →T (n)Ψ (N →∞).
Hence SnΨN
→SnΨ, SnT (n)ΨN
→SnT (n)Ψ (N
→∞).
On the
other hand, SnT (n)ΨN = T (n)SnΨN. Hence, by the closedness of T (n),
SnΨ ∈D(T (n)) and T (n)SnΨ = SnT (n)Ψ. Thus ⊗n
s H reduces T (n).
We denote by T (n)
b
(n ≥2) the reduced part of T (n) to ⊗n
s H :
D(T (n)
b
) = D(T (n)) ∩(⊗n
s H ) ,
T (n)
b
Ψ = T (n)Ψ, Ψ ∈D(T (n)
b
).
(5.3)
We set T (0)
b
:= 0, T (1)
b
:= T. By Theorem 1.38(iv), for all n ∈{0}∪N, T (n)
b
is closed.
The next proposition is concerned with spectral and core properties of
T (n)
b
with T being self-adjoint.
Proposition 5.3. Let T be self-adjoint.
(i) For all n ≥0, T (n)
b
is self-adjoint.
(ii) If D be a core for T p with some p ∈N, then Sn(b⊗
nD) is a core for

Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 1.38(ix).
(ii) This follows from Theorem 3.10(iii) and Theorem 1.38(iv).
(iii) Let the set on the right hand side of (5.4) be Σ. Then, by Theorem
3.8(i), Σ = σ(T (n)). Hence, by Proposition 1.39(ii), σ(T (n)
b
) ⊂Σ.
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λj ∈σ(T ), j = 1, . . . , n.
There exist a natural number s ≤n and a set {µ1, . . . , µs} with µ1 < µ2 <
· · · < µs and {λj | j = 1, . . . , n} = {µ1, . . . , µs} (i.e., µk’s are mutually
diﬀerent λj’s).
For each k = 1, . . . , s, let nk := #{λj | λj = µk} (the
number of λj’s equal to µk). Obviously one has n1 + · · · + ns = n and
s

200

Since µk ∈σ(T ), it follows that, for each N ∈N, ET ((µk −1/N, µk +
1/N)) ̸= 0.
Hence there exists a vector ΨN ∈H such that φk,N :=
ET ((µk −1/N, µk + 1/N))ΨN
̸=
0.
Therefore, putting Φk,N
:=
φk,N/∥φk,N∥, we have ∥Φk,N∥= 1 and ∥(T −µk)Φk,N∥→0 (N →∞).
Since µk ̸= µk′ for k ̸= k′ (k, k′ = 1, . . . , s), there exists a natural number
N0 such that, for all N ≥N0, Φk,N ⊥Φk′,N, k ̸= k′. So let
ΦN :=
r

n1! · · · ns!Φn1
1,N · · · Φns
s,N.
Then, for all N ≥N0, ∥ΦN∥= 1 and ΦN ∈D(T (n)

(iv) Let the set on the right hand side of (5.5) be Σ′. Let λj ∈σp(T ), j =
1, . . . , n, and µk, k = 1, . . . , s, be as in the proof of part (i). In the present
case, each µk ∈σp(T ). Hence there exists a unit vector Ψk ∈D(T ) such
that T Ψk = µkΨk. By the Hermiteness of T , Ψk ⊥Ψk′ if k ̸= k′. Let
Ψ := Ψn1

To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(T (n)

such that λ = Pn
j=1 λj. Hence σp(T (n)

5.3.2
Boson second quantization operators and their basic
properties
We are now ready to state and prove some facts on the reduction of a second
quantization operator dΓ(·) to the boson Fock space Fb(H ):
Theorem 5.1. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
(i) The second quantization dΓ(T ) is reduced by the boson Fock space
Fb(H ).
(ii) Let dΓb(T ) be the reduced part of dΓ(T ) to Fb(H ) (see Section 1.9):
dΓb(T ) := dΓ(T )Fb(H ).
Then
dΓb(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0T (n)
b
.
(iii) dΓb(T ∗) ⊂dΓb(T )∗.
(iv) If D is a core for T , then Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓb(T ).
(v) If T is self-adjoint and D ⊂H is a core for T p with some p ∈N,
then Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓb(T )p.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(dΓ(T )) and, for each N ∈N, deﬁne the vec-
tor ΨN as follows: Ψ(n)
N
= Ψ(n), n ≤N; Ψ(n)
N
= 0, n ≥N + 1.
Then
ΨN ∈D(dΓ(T )) and ΨN →Ψ, dΓ(T )ΨN →dΓ(T )Ψ (N →∞). Hence
PbΨN →PbΨ, PbdΓ(T )ΨN →PbdΓ(T )Ψ (N →∞). On the other hand,
by Proposition 5.2, for all n ≥0,
(PbdΓ(T )ΨN)(n) = SnT (n)Ψ(n)
N
= T (n)SnΨ(n)
N
= (dΓ(T )PbΨN)(n).
Hence PbdΓ(T )ΨN = dΓ(T )PbΨN. Therefore
dΓ(T )PbΨN →PbdΓ(T )Ψ (N →∞).
By the closedness of dΓ(T ), PbΨ ∈D(dΓ(T )) and
dΓ(T )PbΨ = PbdΓ(T )Ψ.
(5.6)
Thus dΓ(T ) is reduced by Fb(H ).
(ii) This is due to (5.6) and (5.3).
(iii) This follows from Theorem 4.7(i) and Proposition 1.39(iv).
(iv) This follows from Theorem 4.7(iii) and Theorem 1.38(iv).
(v) By Theorem 4.4(iii), we have
dΓb(T )p = ⊕∞
n=0(T (n)
b
)p.
Hence, applying Proposition 5.3(ii) and Theorem 4.1(ii), we obtain the
desired result.
 

202
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The operator dΓb(T ) is called the boson second quantization oper-
ator for T .
In the context of Bose ﬁeld theory with T being a one-particle Hamil-
tonian, dΓb(T ) gives a general form of the Hamiltonian of a free (non-
interacting) Bose ﬁeld.
The following theorem summarizes basic properties of dΓb(T ) with T
being self-adjoint.
Theorem 5.2. Let T be self-adjoint.
(i) dΓb(T ) is self-adjoint.
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓb(T ) ≥0.
(iii) If σ(T ) ∩(−∞, 0) ̸= ∅then dΓb(T ) is not bounded from below.
Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 1.38(ix).
(ii) This follows from Theorem 4.7(iv).
(iii) This can be proved in the same way as in the proof of Theorem
4.7(v).
Example 5.3. Let us consider the boson Fock space Fb(L2(X, dµ)) over
L2(X, dµ) (see Example 5.2). Let F be a real-valued measurable function
on X such that F(x) is ﬁnite for µ-a.e.x ∈X. Then the multiplication
operator on L2(X, dµ) by the function F is self-adjoint (e.g., [Arai (1997a),
p.97]). We denote the multiplication operator by the same symbol F if
there would be no danger of confusion. It is easy to see that, for all n ≥1
and j = 1, . . . , n,
(UX,n(I ⊗· · · I⊗

5.3.4
Commutation properties
In this subsection, we describe commutation properties of boson second
quantization operators.
Theorem 5.4. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
such that D([S, T ]) is dense and [S, T ] is closable. Then Fb,ﬁn(D([S, T ])) ⊂
D([dΓb(S), dΓb(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D([S, T ])),
[dΓb(S), dΓb(T )]Ψ = dΓb([S, T ])Ψ.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4.17 and the reducibility of dΓ(T ) to
Fb(H ).
We denote by Nb the reduced part of the number operator b
N = dΓ(I)
on the full Fock space F(H ) to Fb(H ):
Nb := b
NFb(H ).
We call Nb the boson number operator on Fb(H ).
As a corollary to Theorem 5.4, we have the following fact:
 

204
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Corollary 5.1. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([Nb, dΓb(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )),
[Nb, dΓb(T )]Ψ = 0.
In the case where S and T are self-adjoint, it is natural to ask when
dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly commute.
Lemma 5.1. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, for all z ∈C,
eizdΓ(T ) is reduced by Fb(H ) and
(eizdΓ(T ))Fb(H ) = eizdΓb(T ).
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 1.40 with M = Fb(H ), f(λ) =
eizλ and A = dΓ(T ).
Remark 5.1. The operators eizdΓ(T ) and eizdΓb(T ) are not necessarily
bounded.
The following proposition gives an answer to the above question.
Proposition 5.4. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H .
(i) dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly commute if and only if S and T strongly
commute.
(ii) Nb and dΓb(T ) strongly commute.
Proof. (i) Suppose that dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly commute. Then
eis dΓb(S)eit dΓb(T ) = eit dΓb(T )eis dΓb(S),
s, t ∈R.
(5.10)
Restricting this equation to the one-particle space ⊗1
sH = H , we have
eisSeitT = eitT eisS. Hence S and T strongly commute.
Conversely suppose that S and T strongly commute. Then, by Theorem
4.18, eis dΓ(S) and eit dΓ(T ) strongly commute for all s, t ∈R. Hence
eis dΓ(S)eit dΓ(T ) = eit dΓ(T )eis dΓ(S),
s, t ∈R.
By Lemma 5.1, this implies (5.10). Hence dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly
commute.
(ii) It is obvious that S = I and T strongly commute. Hence, by part
(i), Nb and dΓb(T ) strongly commute.

Boson Γ-operators
Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator from a Hilbert space H to
a Hilbert space K . In the same way as in Proposition 5.2, one can prove
that, for each n ≥2,
Sn(⊗nT ) ⊂(⊗nT )Sn.
(5.11)
Hence we can deﬁne a densely deﬁned closed operator (⊗nT )b from ⊗n
s H
to ⊗n
s K as follows: (⊗0T )b := 1, (⊗1T )b := T and, for n ≥2,
D((⊗nT )b) := D(⊗nT ) ∩(⊗n
s H ),
(⊗nT )bΨ := (⊗nT )Ψ.
In the case H = K , (⊗nT )b is nothing but the reduced part of ⊗nT to
⊗n
s H .
Lemma 5.2. Let H , K
and T be as above.
Then Pb(K )Γ(T ) ⊂
Γ(T )Pb(H ).
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(Γ(T )).
Then, for all n ≥0, Ψ(n) ∈D(⊗nT )
and P∞
n=0 ∥(⊗nT )Ψ∥2
<
∞.
By (5.11), SnΨ(n)
∈
D(⊗nT ) and
(⊗nT )SnΨ(n) = Sn(⊗nT )Ψ(n). Hence it follows that Pb(H )Ψ ∈D(Γ(T ))
and Γ(T )Pb(H )Ψ = Pb(K )Γ(T )Ψ.
By Lemma 5.2, we can deﬁne a densely deﬁned closed operator Γb(T )
from Fb(H ) to Fb(K ) as follows:
D(Γb(T )) := Fb(H ) ∩D(Γ(T )),
(5.12)
Γb(T )Ψ := Γ(T )Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(Γb(T )).
(5.13)
Then we have
Γb(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0(⊗nT )b.
Note that, if H = K , then Γb(T ) is the reduced part of Γ(T ) to Fb(H ).
We call the operator Γb(T ) the boson Γ-operator for T .
Remark 5.2. For an anti-unitary operator W : H →K (see Section 4.9),
we deﬁne
Γb(W) = JC ⊕(⊕∞
n=1(⊗nW) ↾⊗n
s H )) .
It is easy to see that Γb(W) is anti-unitary.
We next derive some basic properties of the reduced Γ-operator Γb(·).
Theorem 5.5. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator from H to K .

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(i) If T is unbounded or bounded with ∥T ∥> 1, then Γb(T ) is unbounded.
(ii) Γb(T ∗) ⊂Γb(T )∗.
(iii) If T is a contraction operator, then Γb(T ) is a contraction operator
and
Γb(T )∗= Γb(T ∗).
(5.14)
(iv) If D is a core for T , then Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for Γb(T ).
Proof. (i) Let T be unbounded. Then (⊗1T )b = T is unbounded. Hence,
by Proposition 4.5, Γb(T ) is unbounded.
Next let T be bounded with
∥T ∥> 1. Then there exist a constant c > 0 and a unit vector f ∈H such
that ∥T f∥≥1 + c. Hence
∥(⊗nT )b∥≥∥(⊗nT ) ⊗n f∥= ∥T f∥n ≥(1 + c)n.
Hence supn≥1 ∥(⊗nT )b∥= ∞.
Therefore, by Proposition 4.4, Γb(T ) is
unbounded.
(ii) This follows from Theorem 4.10(i) and Proposition 1.39(iv).
(iii) By Theorem 4.9(ii), Γ(T ) is a contraction operator.
Hence
∥Γb(T )∥≤∥Γ(T )∥≤1. Equality (5.14) follows from Theorem 4.10(ii).
(iv) This follows from Theorem 4.10(iii).
Theorem 5.6. Let H , K and X be Hilbert spaces.
(i) If T is self-adjoint on H , then so is Γb(T ).
(ii) If U : H →K is unitary, then so is Γb(U) : Fb(H ) →Fb(K ) and
Γb(U)−1 = Γb(U −1).
Moreover,
Γb(U)Fb,ﬁn(H ) = Fb,ﬁn(K ).
(iii) (product law) Let S ∈B(H , K ) and T ∈B(K , X ) be contraction
operators. Then,
Γb(T )Γb(S) = Γb(T S).
(iv) Let Tn, T, n ∈N be contraction operators from H to K satisfying
s- limn→∞Tn = T . Then
s- lim
n→∞Γb(Tn) = Γb(T ).
(v) Let H = K and M be a closed subspace of H . Let PM be the orthog-
onal projection onto M . Then Γb(PM ) is the orthogonal projection
onto Fb(M ) ⊂Fb(H ).
 

Boson Fock Spaces
207
Proof. These follow from Theorem 4.11 and the theory of reduction of
operators (cf. Section 1.9).
Basic relations between the boson second quantization operator dΓb(T )
and the boson Γ-operator Γb(T ) are given in the following theorem:
Theorem 5.7. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H .
(i) For all t ∈R,
Γb(eitT ) = eitdΓb(T ).
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓb(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+,
Γb(e−zT ) = e−zdΓb(T ).
Proof. This theorem follows from Theorem 4.14 and Theorem 1.40.
Theorem 5.8. Let U : H →K (a Hilbert space) be a unitary operator
and T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then
Γb(U)dΓb(T )Γb(U)−1 = dΓb(UT U −1).
(5.15)
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4.16 and Proposition 1.42.
Theorem 4.12 and Corollary 4.3 immediately yield the following results
on unitary representations of a group on Fb(H ):
Theorem 5.9. Let U0 be a subgroup of U(H ). Then the mapping Γb(·):
U0 ∋U 7→Γb(U) ∈U(Fb(H )) gives a faithful strongly continuous unitary
representation of U0 on Fb(H ).
Corollary 5.2. Let G be a group and ρ : G →U(H ) be a unitary represen-
tation. Then {Γb(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a unitary representation of G on Fb(H ).
In particular, if G is a topological space and ρ is strongly continuous, then
{Γb(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a strongly continuous unitary representation.

5.6
Trace of Γb-operator
Theorem 5.10(ii) suggests that the trace of Γb(T ) may give an interesting
result.
Theorem 5.11. Assume that H is separable and T is a non-negative and
injective trace class operator such that σ(T ) \ {0} = σd(T ) = {λn}∞
n=1 and
supn≥1 λn < 1 counting multiplicity. Then Γb(T ) is trace class and
Tr Γb(T ) =
1
Q∞
n=1(1 −λn).
(5.16)
Proof. Without loss of generality, one can assume that 0 < · · · ≤λn+1 ≤
λn ≤· · · ≤λ2 ≤λ1 < 1. Let en be an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue
λn: T en = λnen. Then {en}n∈N is a CONS of H . By Proposition 5.1,
{ΩH } ∪

For each (j1, . . . , jN), there exists a unique sequence (n1, n2, . . .) of non-

λj1 · · · λjN =

(5.17)

r=1 nr = N. Conversely, for each sequence (n1, n2, . . .)
of non-negative integers such that P∞

Since T is trace class, P∞

we have

Hence Γb(T ) is trace class and (5.16) holds.
Corollary 5.3. Under the same assumption as in Theorem 5.11, for all
z ∈C such that |z| ≤1, Γb(z)Γb(T ) and Γb(zT ) are trace class and
Tr Γb(zT ) = Tr Γb(z)Γb(T ) =
1
Q∞
n=1(1 −zλn).
(5.19)
Proof. Since |z| ≤1, Γb(z) is in B(Fb(H )). Hence Γb(z)Γb(T ) is trace
class by Proposition 1.14.
By the product law of Γb-operator, we have
Γb(z)Γb(T ) = Γb(zT ). Hence Γb(zT ) is trace class and
Tr Γb(z)Γb(T ) = Tr Γb(zT ).
Let z ̸= 0. Then it is obvious that σd(zT ) \ {0} = {zλn}n≥1 and (zT )en =
zλnen, n ≥1. Hence
Tr Γb(zT ) = 1 +

Then, in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 5.11, one can derive
(5.19). In the case z = 0, we have Γb(0) = PΩH , the orthogonal projection
onto {αΩH |α ∈C}. Hence Tr Γb(0) = 1. Hence, in this case too, (5.19)
holds.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
211
A special case z = eiθ in Γb(z) (θ ∈R) may be interesting. By Theorem
5.7(i) and dΓb(I) = Nb, we have
Γb(eiθ) = eiθNb.
Hence we obtain the following results.
Corollary
5.4. Under
the
same
assumption
as
in
Theorem
5.11,
eiθNbΓb(T ) is trace class for all θ ∈R and
Tr eiθNbΓb(T ) =
1
Q∞
n=1(1 −eiθλn).
Corollary 5.5. Assume that H is separable and T is a strictly positive
self-adjoint operator having purely discrete spectrum σd(T ) = {En}∞
n=1 with
E1 ≤E2 ≤· · · ≤En ≤En+1 ≤· · · and En →∞(n →∞), counting
multiplicity, and P∞
n=1 e−βEn < ∞for some constant β > 0. Then, for all
θ ∈R, eiθNbe−βdΓb(T ) is trace class and
Tr eiθNbe−βdΓb(T ) =
1
Q∞
n=1(1 −e−βEn+iθ).
(5.20)
Proof. The condition P∞
n=1 e−βEn implies that e−βT is a non-negative
and injective trace class operator with eigenvalues {e−βEn}∞
n=1.
Hence,
applying Corollary 5.4 to the case where T is replaced by e−βT , we obtain
the desired result.
Remark 5.3. In the context of quantum statistical mechanics, the function
: (0, ∞) ∋β 7→Tr e−βdΓb(T ) (the case θ = 0) gives the partition function
with Hamiltonian dΓb(T ) (see Section 1.6), where β > 0 denotes the inverse
temperature.
5.7
Boson Annihilation and Creation Operators
In Section 4.13, we introduced annihilation and creation operators acting
in the full Fock space F(H ). In this section we study their realizations in
the boson Fock space.
5.7.1
Deﬁnitions and basic properties
Let ℓ(f) and ℓ(f)∗be respectively the annihilation operator and the creation
operator on the full Fock space F(H ) with f ∈H (see Section 4.13).
 

212
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We specialize the complex sequence α = {αn}∞
n=0 in Section 4.13 to the
following case:
αn = √n,
n ≥0.
Then ℓ(f) and ℓ(f)∗take the following forms:
(ℓ(f)Ψ)(n) =
√
n + 1cn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1), n ≥0, Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)),
(5.21)
(ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = √ncn,+(f)Ψ(n−1)
= √n f ⊗Ψ(n−1), n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)∗).
(5.22)
One can easily infer from (5.22) that an operator acting in Fb(H ) corre-
sponding to ℓ(f)∗is deﬁned as follows:
D(A†(f)) :=
(
Ψ ∈Fb(H )|
∞
X
n=0
∥√nSn(f ⊗Ψ(n−1))∥2 < ∞
)
,
(5.23)
(A†(f)Ψ)(n) = 0,
(5.24)
(A†(f)Ψ)(n) := √nSn(f ⊗Ψ(n−1)),
Ψ ∈D(A†(f)).
(5.25)
It follows that
A†(f) ⊃Pb(H )ℓ(f)∗↾(D(ℓ(f)∗) ∩Fb(H )).
Note that the operator on the right hand side is not closed. But one has
the following:
Lemma 5.4. For all f ∈H , A†(f) is a densely defned closed operator on
Fb(H ) and the adjoint
A(f) := A†(f)∗
takes the following form:
D(A(f)) =
(
Ψ ∈Fb(H )|
∞
X
n=0
∥
√
n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1)∥2 < ∞
)
,
(A(f)Ψ)(n) :=
√
n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1)),
Ψ ∈D(A(f)).
In particular, A(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on Fb(H ).
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 4.3 to the following case: H =
Fb(H ), Hn = ⊗n
s H and A(n)
+
= √n + 1Sn+1cn,+(f)Sn (this is a bounded
operator from ⊗n
s H to ⊗n+1
s
H ).
 

Boson Fock Spaces
213
It follows from the deﬁnition of A(f) and the closedness of A†(f) that
A(f)∗= A†(f),
f ∈H .
We call A(f) and A(f)∗the boson annihilation operator and the boson
creation operator with test vector f respectively.
For a class of vectors Ψ ∈D(A(f)), A(f)Ψ is explicitly written:
Lemma 5.5. For any Ψ ∈Fb(H ) of the form Ψ(m) = δm,nSn(⊗nfj) with
fj ∈H (n ≥1, m ≥0),
(A(f)Ψ)(m) = δm,n−1

n
X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩Sn−1(f1 ⊗· · · ⊗ˆfj ⊗· · · ⊗fn), (5.26)
where ˆfj indicates the omission of fj.
Proof. Since Ψ(m) = 0 for all m ̸= n, it follows that (A(f)Ψ)(m) = 0 for
all m ̸= n −1. Hence we need only to prove (5.26) in the case m = n −1.
We have
(A(f)Ψ)(n−1) = Sn−1(ℓ(f)Ψ)(n−1)
= Sn−1

where we have used Theorem 2.9(iv). Since P
σ∈Sn,σ(1)=j 1 = (n −1)!, one
obtains (5.26).
Lemma 5.6. For all f ∈H \ {0}, A(f) and A(f)∗are unbounded.
Proof. For each N ∈N, we deﬁne a vector ΨN ∈Fb(H ) by Ψ(N)
N
:=
⊗Nf/∥f∥N and Ψ(n)
N
= 0 for n ̸= N. Then ΨN ∈D(A(f)) and ∥ΨN∥=
1. Moreover (A(f)ΨN)(N−1) =
√
N ⊗N−1 f/∥f∥N−2 and (A(f)ΨN)(n) =
0, n ̸= N −1. Hence ∥A(f)ΨN∥=
√
N∥f∥→∞as N →∞. Thus A(f) is
unbounded. Hence, by Proposition 1.7, A(f)∗also is unbounded.
Example 5.4. Let us consider the boson Fock space Fb(L2(X, dµ))
over L2(X, dµ) (Example 5.2) and see what form A(f) and A(f)∗(f ∈
L2(X, dµ)) take under the natural isomorphism (5.2). For notational sim-
plicity, we use the natural identiﬁcation of Ψ(n) ∈⊗n

Let f ∈L2(X, dµ) and Ψ ∈

Boson Fock Spaces
215
The boson ﬁnite particle subspace is deﬁned by
Fb,0(H ) := Pb(H )F0(H ) = b⊕
∞
n=0 ⊗n
s H .
It is obvious that
Fb,0(H ) ⊂D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗),
f ∈H .
In what follows, we denote by A(f)# either A(f) or A(f)∗.
We set
A(f)∅= A(f) so that # = ∅or ∗.
Proposition 5.5. Let f ∈H .
(i) The operator A(f)# leaves Fb,0(H ) invariant: A(f)#Fb,0(H ) ⊂
Fb,0(H ).
(ii) The subspace Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f)#.
(iii) For any dense subspace D in H , Fﬁn,b(D) is a core for A(f)#.
Proof. (i) This follows from the deﬁnition of A(f)#.
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(A(f)) and, for each N ∈N, deﬁne a vector ΨN ∈
Fb,0(H ) by Ψ(n)
N
:= Ψ(n) for n ≤N and Ψ(n)
N
= 0 for n ≥N + 1. Then it
is easy to see that ΨN →Ψ and
∥A(f)ΨN −A(f)Ψ∥2 =
∞
X
n=N+1
n∥Sn−1cn−1,+(f)∗Ψ(n)∥2 →0 (N →∞).
Hence A(f)ΨN →A(f)Ψ (N →∞). Thus Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f).
Similarly one can show that Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f)∗.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ).
Then, there exists an n0 ∈N such that
Ψ(n)
= 0 for all n ≥n0 + 1.
Let n ≤n0.
Since Sn(b⊗
nD) is
dense in ⊗n
s H , there exists a sequence {Ψ(n)
k }k in Sn(b⊗
nD) such that
Ψ(n)
k
→Ψ(n) (k →∞). Recall that cn,+(f) is a bounded operator. Hence
√n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1)
k
→√n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1) (k →∞). There-
fore, putting Ψk := {Ψ(0)
k , . . . , Ψ(n0)
k
, 0, 0, . . .} ∈Fb,ﬁn(D), we see that
Ψk →Ψ and A(f)Ψk →A(f)Ψ (k →∞). Hence, by an application of
Proposition 1.10, Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for A(f). Similarly one can prove that
Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for A(f)∗.
It follows from the deﬁnition of A(f) that, for all f ∈H ,
A(f)ΩH = 0.
(5.28)
The Fock vacuum ΩH as an element of the boson Fock space Fb(H )
is called the boson Fock vacuum. This vector is in fact characterized by
Eq. (5.28):

Proposition 5.6. Let D be a dense subspace of H . Suppose that a vector
Ψ ∈∩f∈DD(A(f)) obeys A(f)Ψ = 0 for all f ∈D. Then Ψ = c ΩH with
a constant c ∈C.
Proof. By the present assumption, Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1) = 0 for all n ≥0.
Hence, for all Φ ∈⊗n
s H ,
0 =
D
Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ(n+1), Φ

Ψ(n+1), Sn+1(f ⊗Φ)

= 0.
On the other hand, span {Sn+1(f ⊗Φ)|f ∈D, Φ ∈⊗n
s H } is dense in
⊗n+1
s
H . Hence Ψ(n+1) = 0, n ≥0. Hence Ψ = {Ψ(0), 0, 0, · · ·} = c ΩH
with c := Ψ(0) ∈C.
Remark 5.4. For any ﬁnite set F := {f1, . . . , fm} consisting of linearly
independent vectors f1, . . . , fm in H (m < dim H ), there always exists a
non-zero vector Ψ ∈∩m
j=1D(A(fj)) which is not a scalar multiple of ΩH
and obeys A(fj)Ψ = 0, j = 1, · · · , m. For example, let g ∈F ⊥\{0} and, for
each n ∈N, deﬁne Ψg ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ) by Ψ(0)
g
:= α (α ∈C is arbitrary) and
Ψ(n)
g
:= ⊗ng (n ≥1), Ψ(k)
g
:= 0, k ̸= n. Then A(fj)Ψg = 0, j = 1, . . . , m.
But Ψg is not a scalar multiple of ΩH .
In fact, one can prove the following fact (Problem 1):
{Ψ ∈∩m
j=1D(A(fj)) | A(fj)Ψ = 0, j = 1, . . . , m} = ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n
s F ⊥.
(5.29)
The proof is based on the orthogonal decomposition H = (span F) ⊕F ⊥
and the natural isomorphism Fb(H ) ∼= Fb(span F)⊗Fb(F ⊥) (see Section
5.20 below), where A(fj) is unitarily equivalent to A(fj) ⊗I.
Using (5.25) repeatedly, one can see that, for all n ∈N, and fj ∈H (j =
1, . . . , n),
(A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH )(m) = δnm
√
n!f1 · · · fn,
m ≥1.
(5.30)
This means that span {A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH | fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n} is
dense in the boson n-particle space. Formula (5.30) also implies the follow-
ing inequality:
∥A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ∥≤
√
n!∥f1∥· · · ∥fn∥.
(5.31)
It follows from (5.30) that, for each subspace D of H ,
Fb,ﬁn(D) =span

ΩH , A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH | n ∈N,
fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , n
	
.
(5.32)
In particular, if D is dense in H , then
span {ΩH , A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH | n ∈N, fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , n}

is dense in Fb(H ). This shows a basic role of the creation operators.
Moreover, (5.30) implies the following important inner product formula:
for all fj, gk ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n, k = 1, . . . , m (n, m ≥1),
⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH ⟩

is a CONS of Fb(H ), where Cj1···jn is deﬁned by (2.49) with N = n.
Proof. This follows from (5.30) and Proposition 5.1.
In relation to (5.32), we want to mention a basic concept in operator
theory.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let X be a Hilbert space and {Aα|α ∈S} be a set of linear
operators on X (Aα ∈L(X ) and S is an index set). A non-zero vector
Ψ0 ∈X is called a cyclic vector of {Aα|α ∈S} if Ψ0 ∈∩∞
n=1∩αj∈S,j=1,...,n
D(Aα1 · · · Aαn) and span {Ψ0, Aα1 · · · AαnΨ0 | n ∈N, αj ∈S, j = 1, . . . , n}
is dense in X . In this case {Aα|α ∈S} is said to have a cyclic vector Ψ0.
Formula (5.32) with D dense in H is rephrased as follows:
Proposition 5.7. Suppose that D is a dense subspace of H . Then the
Fock vacuum ΩH is a cyclic vector of {A(f)∗|f ∈D}.3
5.7.2
Commutation relations
Let us ﬁnd commutation relations of A(f)#’s (f ∈H ).
For each r ∈
{0} ∪N, we introduce
Fb,r(H ) := {Ψ ∈Fb(H ) | Ψ(n) = 0 for all n ≥r + 1}.
This is a closed subspace of Fb(H ), which is naturally isomorohic to
⊕r
n=0 ⊗n
s H .
3In this case the index set S is D.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In the context of a Bose ﬁeld theory, Fb,r(H ) is a Hilbert space of
states for the subsystem consisting of at most r bosons.
Lemma 5.7. Let f ∈H and r ≥0. We set Fb,−1(H ) = {0}.
(i) A(f) is a bounded operator from Fb,r(H ) to Fb,r−1(H ) with
∥A(f) ↾Fb,r(H )∥≤√r∥f∥.
(ii) A(f)∗is a bounded operator from Fb,r(H ) to Fb,r+1(H ) with
∥A(f)∗↾Fb,r(H )∥≤
√
r + 1∥f∥.
(iii) Let fn, f ∈H and limn→∞fn = f. Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ),
limn→∞A(fn)Ψ = A(f)Ψ and limn→∞A(fn)∗Ψ = A(f)∗Ψ.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fb,r(H ). Then it is easy to see that A(f)Ψ ∈Fb,r−1(H )
and A(f)∗Fb,r+1(H ).
(i) Using the fact that ∥Sn∥≤1 and ∥cn,+(f)∗∥= ∥f∥, we have
∥A(f)Ψ∥2 =

∥Ψ(n+1)∥2 ≤r∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence the desired result follows.
(ii) In the same way as in (i), we have
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 =
r+1
X
n=1
∥√nSn−1cn−1,+(f)Ψ(n−1)∥2
≤(r + 1)∥f∥2
r+1

n=1
∥Ψ(n−1)∥2 = (r + 1)∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence the desired result follows.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ).
Then there exists an r ≥0 such that
Ψ
∈
Fb,r(H ).
By (i), ∥A(fn)Ψ −A(f)Ψ∥
≤
√r∥fn −f∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence limn→∞A(fn)Ψ = A(f)Ψ.
Similarly, using (ii), we can prove
limn→∞A(fn)∗Ψ = A(f)∗Ψ.
Theorem 5.13. For all f, g ∈H ,
[A(f), A(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩
(5.34)
[A(f), A(g)] = 0,
[A(f)∗, A(g)∗] = 0
(5.35)
on Fb,0(H ).

Proof. n ≥1 and fj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , n), we deﬁne a vector Ψn ∈Fb,0(H )
by
Ψ(m)

; m ̸= n .
Then

⟨f, fj⟩f1 · · · ˆfj · · · fn ; m = n −1

By (5.25),
(A(g)∗Ψn)(m) =
√n + 1gf1 · · · fn ; m = n + 1
0
; m ̸= n + 1 .
Hence
(A(f)A(g)∗Ψn)(n) = ⟨f, g⟩f1 · · · fn +

⟨f, fj⟩gf1 · · · ˆfj · · · fn,
(A(g)∗A(f)Ψn)(n) =

j=1
⟨f, fj⟩gf1 · · · ˆfj · · · fn.
Therefore
([A(f), A(g)∗]Ψn)(n) = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ(n)
n .
If m ̸= n, then (A(f)A(g)∗Ψn)(m) = 0, (A(g)∗A(f)Ψn)(m) = 0. Thus
[A(f), A(g)∗]Ψn = ⟨f, g⟩Ψn.
It is easy to see that
[A(f), A(g)∗]ΩH = ⟨f, g⟩ΩH .
Since any vector in Fb,ﬁn(H ) is written as a ﬁnite linear combination of
ΩH and vectors of the form Ψn (n ≥1, f1, . . . , fn ∈H ), it follows that,
for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ),
[A(f), A(g)∗]Ψ = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ.
(5.36)
We next consider the case where Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ). Then there exists a
sequence {ΨN}∞
N=1 in Fb,ﬁn(H ) such that ΨN →Ψ (N →∞). By (5.36),
A(f)A(g)∗ΨN −A(g)∗A(f)ΨN = ⟨f, g⟩ΨN.
There exists a number r ∈N such that Ψ, ΨN ∈Fb,r(H ) for all N ≥1
(one can take ΨN in such a way). By Lemma 5.7,
A(f)A(g)∗ΨN →A(f)A(g)∗Ψ, A(g)∗A(f)ΨN →A(g)∗A(f)Ψ (N →∞).
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), (5.36) holds.
Namely, (5.34) holds on
Fb,0(H ). Similarly one can prove (5.35).
 

220
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We call commutation relations (5.34) and (5.35) the Dirac canonical
commutation relations (CCR) over H . But, in what follows, we call
them the CCR over H simply.
Remark 5.5. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H and an := A(en) (n ∈N).
Then (5.34) and (5.35) imply the following commutation relations: for all
n, m ∈N,
[an, a∗
m] = δnm, [an, am] = 0, [a∗
n, a∗
m] = 0
on Fb,0(H ).
With regard to the domain of A(f)#, we have in fact the following:
Corollary 5.6. For all f ∈H , D(A(f)) = D(A(f)∗) and, for all Ψ ∈
D(A(f)) (= D(A(f)∗),
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 = ∥A(f)Ψ∥2 + ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
(5.37)
Proof. Using (5.34) with g = f, we have
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 = ∥A(f)Ψ∥2 + ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ).
(5.38)
Let Ψ ∈D(A(f)). Then, by Proposition 5.5(ii)), there exists a sequence
{Ψn}n ⊂Fb,0(H ) such that Ψn →Ψ and A(f)Ψn →A(f)Ψ (n →∞).
Replacing Ψ by Ψn −Ψm in (5.38), we see that {A(f)∗Ψn}n is a Cauchy
sequence.
Since A(f)∗is closed, we conclude that Ψ ∈D(A(f)∗) and
A(f)∗Ψ = limn→∞A(f)∗Ψn.
Hence D(A(f)) ⊂D(A(f)∗) and (5.37)
holds. Similarly one can show that D(A(f)∗) ⊂D(A(f)).
Theorem 5.13 implies a useful formula:
Corollary 5.7. Let n ∈N and f, f1, . . . , fn ∈H . Then
A(f)A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
=

where \
A(fj)∗indicates the omission of A(fj)∗.
Proof. By (5.34), we have
A(f)A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= ([A(f), A(f1)∗] + A(f1)∗A(f))A(f2)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= ⟨f, f1⟩A(f2)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH + A(f1)∗A(f)A(f2)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Iterating this equation and using (5.28), we obtain (5.39).

Corollary 5.8. Let D be a subspace of H .
(i) For all f ∈D, A(f)∗Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).
(ii) For all f ∈H , A(f)Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).
Proof. (i) Since f ∈D, it follows from (5.32) that A(f)∗Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂
Fb,ﬁn(D).
(ii) This follows from (5.39).
5.7.3
Irreducibility
In this subsection, we prove another important property of the operator set
{A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈H }. For this purpose, we ﬁrst introduce a concept on a
set of linear operators on a Hilbert space.
Let X be a Hilbert space and A be a set of (not necessarily bounded)
linear operators on X : A ⊂L(X ).
Deﬁnition 5.2.
(i) Let M be a closed subspace of X . Then M is said to reduce A if
each A ∈A is reduced by M . In this case, M is called a reducing
subspace of A.
Remark. Obviously {0} and X reduce A. These spaces are called the trivial
reducing subspaces.
(ii) The set A is said to be reducible if it has a non-trivial reducing
subspace (i.e. there exists a closed subspace M ̸= {0}, X reducing
A).
(iii) The set A is said to be irreducible if it is not reducible (i.e. A has
no non-trivial reducing subspaces).
Remark 5.6. In the case where A ⊂B(X ), it is easy to see that a closed
subspace M is a reducing subspace of A if and only if A leaves M and M ⊥
invariant (i.e. for all A ∈A, AM ⊂M and AM ⊥⊂M ⊥).
We ﬁrst want to show that reducibility and irreducibility are unitarily
invariant concepts.
Let X and Y be Hilbert spaces and A ⊂L(X ) and B ⊂L(Y ). The
operator set A is said to be unitarily equivalent to B if there exists a
unitary operator U : X →Y such that B = {UAU −1|A ∈A}.
It follows that A is unitarily equivalent to B if and only if B is unitarily
equivalent to A (so the above deﬁnition is well-deﬁned).
Proposition 5.8. Let A ⊂L(X ) and B ⊂L(Y ) and suppose that A is
 

222
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
unitarily equivalent to B. Then A is reducible (resp. irreducible) if and
only if B is reducible (resp. irreducible).
Proof. By the present assumption, there exists a unitary operator U :
X →Y such that B = {UAU −1|A ∈A}. Suppose that A is reducible.
Then there exists a closed subspace M ⊂X such that M ̸= {0}, X and
each A ∈A is reduced by M . Let N := UM . Then N is a closed subspace
of Y and N ̸= {0}, Y . Each B ∈B is written B = UAU −1 with some
A ∈A. By Proposition 1.42, B is reduced by N . Thus B is reducible.
Conversely, if B is reducible, then, by symmetry (one needs only to
replace (X , U, A) by (Y , U −1, B) in the above argument), one can conclude
that A is reducible.
To characterize the irreducibility of A, we introduce a subset of B(X )
by
A′ := {T ∈B(X ) | T A ⊂AT, A ∈A},
(5.40)
which is called the commutant of A. It is easy to see that A′ is a subspace
of B(X ).
Lemma 5.8. Let A, B ⊂L(X ) and A ⊂B. Then B′ ⊂A′.
Proof. An easy exercise.
The set A is said to be ∗-invariant if each element A in A is densely
deﬁned closed and A∗∈A. In this case, A∗is densely deﬁned and A∗∗= A.
We denote by CI the set of scalar operators on X :
CI := {cI | c ∈C}.
Proposition 5.9. Let A ⊂L(X ).
(i) If A′ = CI, then A is irreducible.
(ii) Let A be ∗-invariant and irreducible. Then A′ = CI.
Proof. (i) Let M be a reducing subspace of A and P be the orthogonal
projection onto M . Then, for each A ∈A, PA ⊂AP. Hence P ∈A′.
Hence, by the present assumption, P = cI for some c ∈C. Since P = P ∗
and P 2 = P, it follows that c = 0, 1, i.e., P = 0 or I. This means that
M = {0} or X . Thus A is irreducible.
(ii) Let T ∈A′. Then, for all A ∈A, T A ⊂AT . Hence (AT )∗⊂(T A)∗.
We have (AT )∗⊃T ∗A∗and (T A)∗= A∗T ∗(by the boundedness of T ).
Hence T ∗A∗⊂A∗T ∗. By the ∗-invariance of A, A∗∈A. Hence, taking A∗
 

Boson Fock Spaces
223
instead of A and using the fact (A∗)∗= A, we obtain T ∗A ⊂AT ∗. Hence
T ∗∈A′. Therefore the bounded self-adjoint operators S+ := (T + T ∗)/2
and S−:= (T −T ∗)/2i are in A′. Let E(·) be the spectral measure of S+.
Then, via Stone’s formula, E(B)A ⊂AE(B) for all Borel sets B ⊂R and
A ∈A. This means that RanE(B) reduces A. By the irreducibility of A,
RanE(B) = {0} or X . Let a = inf supp E. Then a ∈σ(S+). Hence, for
all ε > 0, E([a, a + ε]) ̸= 0. Thereofre RanE([a, a + ε]) = X . Considering
the limit ε ↓0, we obtain RanE({a}) = X . Hence E({a}) = I, which
implies that S+ = aI. Similarly one can show that S−= bI for some b ∈R.
Therefore T = S+ + iS−= cI (c = a + ib). Thus A′ = CI.
Now we are ready to prove a basic fact on the set of the boson creation
and annihilation operators:
Theorem 5.14. Let D be a dense subspace of H . Then
{A(f), A(f)∗| f ∈D}′ = CI.
(5.41)
In particular, it is irreducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{A(f), A(f)∗| f ∈D}′.
Then T ∈B(Fb(H )) and
T A(f)# ⊂A(f)#T, f ∈D. For each n ≥1, we consider vectors
Ψ(f1, . . . , fn) := A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ,
fj ∈D (j = 1, . . . , n).
Then Ψ(f1, . . . , fn) ∈Fb,ﬁn(D) and, for all g1, . . . , gm ∈D,
⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩
= ⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗T ΩH ⟩
= ⟨A(fn) · · · A(f1)Ψ(g1, · · · , gm), T ΩH ⟩.
(5.42)
If n > m, then, by CCR and (5.28), A(fn) · · · A(f1)Ψ(g1, . . . , gm) = 0.
Hence
⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩= 0
For n = m, using CCR repeatedly, we obtain
A(fn) · · · A(f1)Ψ(g1, . . . , gn) = cΩH ,
where c is a constant depending on f1, . . . , fn, g1, . . . , gn. Taking the inner
product with ΩH , we have
c∗= ⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gn), Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩.
 

224
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence, using (5.42), we obtain
⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gn), T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩
= c∗⟨ΩH , T ΩH ⟩
= ⟨ΩH , T ΩH ⟩⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gn), Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩.
For n < m, using the identity
⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩
= ⟨ΩH , A(gm) · · · A(g1)T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩
= ⟨ΩH , T A(gm) · · · A(g1)Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩
and noting that A(gm) · · · A(g1)Ψ(f1, . . . , fn) = 0, we obtain
⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩= 0.
Thus, for all m, n,
⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), T Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩
= ⟨ΩH , T ΩH ⟩⟨Ψ(g1, . . . , gm), Ψ(f1, . . . , fn)⟩.
By the assumption that D is dense in H , the subspace Fb,ﬁn(D) is dense
in Fb(H ). Hence it follows that, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D),
T Ψ = ⟨ΩH , T ΩH ⟩Ψ.
Using again the density of Fb,ﬁn(D) in Fb(H ) and the boundedness of
T , we conclude that T = ⟨ΩH , T ΩH ⟩I, i.e., T is a scalar operator. Thus
(5.41) holds. The irreducibility of {A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈D} follows from Propo-
sition 5.9(i).
5.7.4
Reduction of creation and annihilation operators
Let M be a closed subspace of H and PM be the orthogonal projection
onto M .
Theorem 5.15. Let f ∈M . Then A(f)# is reduced by Fb(M ).
Proof. By Theorem 5.6(v), Q := Γb(PM ) is the orthogonal projection
onto Fb(M ). Let Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ). Then A(f)∗QΨ = QA(f)∗Ψ. Since
Fb,ﬁn(H ) is a core for A(f)∗, it follows from a limiting argument that
QA(f)∗⊂A(f)∗Q.
Hence Fb(M ) reduces A(f)∗.
Therefore Fb(M )
reduces A(f) too.

Relations among the Creation and Annihilation
Operators and the Second Quantization Operators
So far we have treated the second quantization operators and the creation
and annihilation operators separately. But they should have some non-
trivial relations, because the creation and annihilation operators are non-
diagonal ones. This section is devoted to studies on this aspect.
5.8.1
Relative boundedness of the creation and annihilation
operators with respect to second quantization
operators
The following theorem, which is the main result in this subsection, plays a
basic role in analysis on boson Fock spaces.
Theorem 5.16. Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H . Then, for all f ∈D(T −1/2),
D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗)
and, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2),
∥A(f)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥,
(5.43)
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 ≤∥T −1/2f∥2 ∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
(5.44)
Remark 5.7. (i) By Theorem 5.2, for any non-negative self-adjoint op-
erator T , dΓb(T ) is a non-negative self-adjoint operator. Hence, via the
functional calculus, the square root dΓb(T )1/2 is deﬁned.
(ii) By Corollary 5.6, D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗) = D(A(f)) = D(A(f)∗) for
all f ∈H .
To prove Theorem 5.16, we need some preliminaries.
For each f ∈H and n ≥0, j = 1, . . . , n+1, there exists a unique linear
operator K(n)

Hence
∥A(f)Φ∥2 ≤∥T −1/2f∥2 ⟨Φ, dΓb(T )Φ⟩= ∥T −1/2f∥2∥dΓb(T )1/2Φ∥2.
Since Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓ(T ) by Theorem 5.1(iv), it is a core
for dΓb(T )1/2 (apply Proposition 1.31).
Hence, by Proposition 1.12,
D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(A(f)) and (5.43) holds. Inequality (5.44) follows from
(5.43) and Corollary 5.6.
□
Remark 5.8. In the case where H is separable, Theorem 5.16 can be
proved more easily. The idea of the proof is as follows. One has Theorem
3.11. Hence, by Theorems 5.6(ii) and 5.8 and Examples 5.3 and 5.4, we
have
Γb(U)Fb(H ) = Fb(L2(X, dµ)) ∼= ⊕∞

Then, by Example 5.4, one uses (5.27) to estimate A(f)Φ (Φ ∈D(A(f)).

. Taking the sum-
mation over n ∈Z+ = {0} ∪N, one obtains
∥A(f)Φ∥2 ≤∥F −1/2f∥2∥g
dΓb(T )1/2Φ∥2.
This is equivalent to (5.43). The proof given here shows the usefulness of
Theorem 3.11 and of moving to a suitable unitarily equivalent realization
of the abstract boson Fock space.
Taking T = I in Theorem 5.16, we obtain an estimate showing the
relative boundedness of A(·)# with respect to N 1/2

(5.52)
Proof. Estimate (5.51) is a direct consequence of (5.43). As for (5.52), we
need only to apply formula (1.28) to S = Nb.
Theorem 5.16 also implies inﬁnitesimal smallness of A(f)# (f

D(T −1/2)) with respect to dΓb(T ):

Corollary 5.10. Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator

∥A(f)Ψ∥≤ε∥dΓb(T )Ψ∥+ 1

(5.54)
Proof. We estimate the right hand side of (5.43) and (5.44). Let Ψ ∈
D(dΓb(T )). Then, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥=
p
⟨Ψ, dΓb(T )Ψ⟩≤∥Ψ∥1/2∥dΓb(T )Ψ∥1/2.
Hence, using the elementary inequality
ab ≤εa2 + 1
4εb2
(a > 0, b > 0, ε > 0),
(5.55)
we obtain
∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥≤ε∥dΓb(T )Ψ∥+ 1
4ε∥T −1/2f∥2∥Ψ∥.
This estimate and (5.43) yield (5.53).
Inequality (5.44) implies that
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence we obtain (5.54).
5.8.2
Commutation relations
We next consider commutation properties of the boson second quantization
operators with the creation and annihilation operators.
Proposition 5.10. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
(i) For all f ∈D(T ),
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([dΓb(T ), A(f)∗])
and
[dΓb(T ), A(f)∗] = A(T f)∗on Fb,ﬁn(D(T )).
(ii) For all f ∈D(T ∗),
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([dΓb(T ), A(f)])
and
[dΓb(T ), A(f)] = −A(T ∗f) on Fb,ﬁn(D(T )).
 

Boson Fock Spaces
231
Proof. (i) Let Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). Then, by (5.32), each Ψ(n)
with n ≥1 is a linear combination of vectors of the form
η = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
with fj ∈D(T ), j = 1, . . . , n. Obviously η ∈D(dΓb(T )) and, using (5.30),
we have
dΓb(T )η =
n
X
j=1
A(f1)∗· · · A(T fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ,
(5.56)
which is an element of D(A(f)∗), and
A(f)∗dΓb(T )η =
n
X
j=1
A(f)∗A(f1)∗· · · A(T fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Since f is in D(T ), A(f)∗η ∈D(dΓb(T )) and
dΓb(T )A(f)∗η = A(T f)∗η +
n
X
j=1
A(f)∗A(f1)∗· · · A(T fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Hence
[dΓb(T ), A(f)∗]η = A(T f)∗η.
It is easy to see that [dΓb(T ), A(f)∗]ΩH = A(T f)∗ΩH . Thus the desired
result follows.
(ii) Let f ∈D(T ∗). Let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH with fj ∈D(T )
(j = 1, . . . , n). Then, by (5.39), we see as in (i) that Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T ), A(f)])
and
[dΓb(T ), A(f)]Ψ = −A(T ∗f)Ψ
Thus the desired result follows.
In the case where T is self-adjoint, non-negative and injective, Proposi-
tion 5.10 can be more reﬁned:
Theorem 5.17. Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H .
(i) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D(dΓb(T )) and f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2),
⟨dΓb(T )Ψ, A(f)Φ⟩−⟨A(f)∗Ψ, dΓb(T )Φ⟩= −⟨Ψ, A(T f)Φ⟩.
(5.57)
 

232
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) For each f
∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2), A(f)# maps D(dΓb(T )3/2) to
D(dΓb(T )) and satisﬁes commutation relations
[dΓb(T ), A(f)∗] = A(T f)∗,
[dΓb(T ), A(f)] = −A(T f)
on D(dΓb(T )3/2).
Proof. (i) By Proposition 5.10, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) and Φ ∈
D(dΓb(T )), (5.57) holds. Since Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓb(T ), for any
Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )), there exists a sequence {Ψn}n ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) such that
Ψn →Ψ and dΓb(T )Ψn →dΓb(T )Ψ (n →∞). Hence
⟨dΓb(T )Ψn, A(f)Φ⟩−⟨A(f)∗Ψn, dΓb(T )Φ⟩= −⟨Ψn, A(T f)Φ⟩.
By (5.54), A(f)∗Ψn →A(f)∗Ψ (n →∞). Hence, taking the limit n →∞
in the above equation, we obtain (5.57)
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )3/2) and Φ ∈D(dΓb(T )).
Then dΓb(T )Ψ ∈
D(dΓb(T )1/2). Hence, by (i),
⟨(A(f)∗dΓb(T ) + A(T f)∗) Ψ, Φ⟩= ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, dΓb(T )Φ⟩.
This means that A(f)∗Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )) and
dΓb(T )A(f)∗Ψ = (A(f)∗dΓb(T ) + A(T f)∗) Ψ.
Hence the statement on A(f)∗is proved. Similarly one can prove the state-
ment on A(f).
5.8.3
Relative boundedness of A(f)#A(g)♮with respect to
dΓb(T )
Let T be a nonnegative and injective self-adjoint operator on H . As an
application of Theorem 5.17, we show that, for all f, g in a subspace of H ,
A(f)#A(g)# is relatively bounded with respect to dΓb(T ). For notational
simplicity, we set
H := dΓb(T )
throughout this subsection. Since H is nonnegative and self-adjoint, H + 1
is bijective with (H +1)−1 being bounded and ∥(H +1)−1∥= 1. We remark
that, for each f ∈H ,
D((H + 1)−1A(f)#H1/2) = D(A(f)#H1/2)

by the deﬁnition of the product of operators.
Lemma 5.11. Let f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ). Then (H + 1)−1A(f)#H1/2 is
bounded with
∥(H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2∥≤cT (f),
(5.58)
∥(H + 1)−1A(f)∗H1/2∥≤dT (f),
(5.59)
where
cT (f) := ∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥T 1/2f∥,
dT (f) := cT (f) + 1
2(∥f∥+ ∥T f∥).
Proof. By Theorem 5.17(ii), we have
(H + 1)A(f) −A(f)(H + 1) = −A(T f)
on D(H3/2). Since (H + 1)−1H1/2D(H) ⊂D(H3/2) and A(f) is H1/2-
bounded (Theorem 5.16), it follows that
A(f)(H + 1)−1H1/2 −(H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2
= −(H + 1)−1A(T f)(H + 1)−1H1/2
on D(H). Hence, for all Ψ ∈D(H),
∥(H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2Ψ∥
≤∥A(f)(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥+ ∥(H + 1)−1A(T f)(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥

= cT (f)∥H1/2(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥.
By the functional calculus, H1/2(H +1)−1H1/2 is bounded with ∥H1/2(H +
1)−1H1/2∥≤1. Hence (H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2 is bounded and (5.58) holds.
Similarly, using (5.44) and ∥(H + 1)−1H1/2∥= 1/2, one can show that
(H + 1)−1A(f)∗H1/2 is bounded and (5.59) holds.
Lemma 5.12. Let f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ). Then, for all Ψ ∈D(H), Ψ ∈
D(H1/2A(f)#) and
∥H1/2A(f)Ψ∥≤dT (f)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥,
(5.60)
∥H1/2A(f)∗Ψ∥≤cT (f)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥.
(5.61)
 

234
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. By Lemma 5.11, K# := (H + 1)−1A(f)#H1/2 is a densely deﬁned
bounded linear operator on H . Hence (K#)∗∈B(H ) and ∥(K#)∗∥=
∥K#∥. On the other hand, one has (K#)∗⊃H1/2(A(f)#)∗(H + 1)−1.
Hence H1/2(A(f)#)∗(H + 1)−1 is bounded with ∥H1/2(A(f)#)∗(H +
1)−1∥= ∥(K#)∗∥= ∥K#∥. Therefore
∥H1/2A(f)(H + 1)−1∥= ∥K∗∥≤dT (f),
∥H1/2A(f)∗(H + 1)−1∥= ∥K∥≤cT (f),
which imply (5.60) and (5.61) respectively.

Then
D(H)
⊂
D(A(f)#A(g)♮) (#, ♮= ∅, ∗) and, for all Ψ ∈D(H),

(5.65)
Proof. By Lemma 5.12 and the fact D(H1/2)
⊂
D(A(h)#) (h
∈
D(T −1/2)), D(H) ⊂D(A(f)#A(g)♮) and, for all Ψ ∈D(H),
∥A(f)A(g)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2A(g)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2∥dT (g)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥.
Hence (5.62) holds. As for (5.63), we procced as follows:
∥A(f)∗A(g)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2A(g)Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥A(g)Ψ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥dT(g)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥T −1/2g∥∥H1/2Ψ∥.
We note that
∥H1/2Ψ∥= ∥H1/2(H + 1)−1(H + 1)Ψ∥
≤∥H1/2(H + 1)−1∥∥(H + 1)Ψ∥
= 1
2∥(H + 1)Ψ∥.
Thus (5.63) holds. In the same way, (5.64) and (5.65) can be proved.
Thus we see that A(f)#A(g)♮with f, g ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ) is H-
bounded.

Continuity of boson second quantization operators in
one-particle operators
In applications, there are cases where the continuity of dΓb(T ) in T in a
suitable sense is needed to consider. In this subsection, we prove basic facts
on this aspect.
Proposition 5.11. Let Tn (n ∈N) and T be densely deﬁned closable oper-
ators on H such that there exists a subspace D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(T ) ∩D(Tn) and
limn→∞Tnf = T f, f ∈D. Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D),
lim
n→∞dΓb(Tn)Ψ = dΓb(T )Ψ.
(5.66)
Proof. It is suﬃcient to show (5.66) for all vectors Ψ of the form Ψ =
A(f1)∗· · · A(fp)∗ΩH (fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , p, p ∈N). We have
dΓb(Tn)Ψ −dΓb(T )Ψ =
p
X
j=1

Hence, by (5.31),

Cj∥Tnfj −T fj∥
with Cj := ∥f1∥· · · d
∥fj∥· · · ∥fp∥(b∥fj∥indicates the omission of ∥fj∥). The
right hand side converges to 0 as n →∞. Thus (5.66) holds.
Theorem 5.19. Let Tn (n ∈N) and T be self-adjoint operators on H .
Suppose that there exists a core D for T such that D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(Tn) and
limn→∞Tnf = T f, f ∈D. Then:
(i) (strong resolvent convergence) For all z ∈C \ R,
s- lim
n→∞(dΓb(Tn) −z)−1 = (dΓb(T ) −z)−1.
(ii) (strong unitary group convergence) For all t ∈R,
s- lim
n→∞e−itdΓb(Tn) = e−itdΓb(T ).
(iii) (strong semi-group convergence) Suppose that Tn and T are nonnega-
tive. Then, for all β > 0,
s- lim
n→∞e−βdΓb(Tn) = e−βdΓb(T ).
Proof. (i) Since D is a core for T , Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓb(T ). Hence,
by Proposition 5.11, we can apply Theorem 1.41 to conclude that dΓb(Tn)
converges to dΓb(T ) in the strong resolvent sense as n →∞.
Parts (ii) and (iii) follow from (i) and Corollary 1.8(i) and (ii).

terms of creation and annihilation operators
There are some kinds of continuity of the mapping:H ∋f 7→A(f)# ∈
L(Fb(H )) (f ∈H ):
Lemma 5.13.
(i) Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on H .
Let fn, f ∈D(T −1/2) and limn→∞T −1/2fn = T −1/2f. Then, for all
Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2), limn→∞A(fn)Ψ = A(f)Ψ.
(ii) Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on H . Let
fn, f ∈D(T −1/2), limn→∞fn = f and limn→∞T −1/2fn = T −1/2f.
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2), limn→∞A(fn)∗Ψ = A(f)∗Ψ.
(iii) Let fn, f ∈H , limn→∞fn = f.
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
),
limn→∞A(fn)#Ψ = A(f)#Ψ.
(iv)
Let T be a densely deﬁned operator and fn, f ∈D(T ), limn→∞fn = f.
Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗)), limn→∞A(T fn)Ψ = A(T f)Ψ.
Proof. (i) By (5.43),
∥A(fn)Ψ −A(f)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2(fn −f)∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥→0(n →∞).
(ii) The proof of this part is similar to (i) (use (5.44)).
(iii) We need only to apply the facts in (i) and (ii) to the case T = I.
(iv) Let Ψ = A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH
∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗)) (m ≥0, gj ∈
D(T ∗)). Then, using CCR and (5.28), we have
A(T fn)Ψ =
m
X
j=1
⟨fn, T ∗gj⟩A(g1)∗· · ·

\
A(gj)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH .
Hence

j=1
⟨f, T ∗gj⟩A(g1)∗· · ·
jth
⌣
\
A(gj)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH
= A(T f)Ψ.
Thus the desired result follows.
Remark 5.9. Under the condition of part (iv) in Lemma 5.13, A(T fn)∗Ψ
does not necessarily converge to A(T f)∗Ψ as n →∞. For example, it is
easy to see that, if T fn does not converge to T f, then A(T fn)∗ΩH does
not converge to A(T f)∗ΩH as n →∞. In this sense, the regularity of the
operator-valued functional A(·)∗is lower than that of A(·).

The next theorem gives formulae for the second quantization operators
in terms of the creation and annihilation operators.
Theorem 5.20. Let K be a separable Hilbert space and Let T be a densely
deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
(i) Let S ∈B(K , H ) and ST be closable.5 Let {en|n ∈N} ⊂D(T ∗) be
a CONS of K . Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(ST )),
dΓb(ST )Ψ =

In particular, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ),
NbΨ =

(5.68)
(ii) Let S be a densely deﬁned linear operator from K to H such that
ST is a densely deﬁned closable operator and {en|n ∈N} ⊂D(S) ∩
D(T ∗) be a CONS of K . Then, for all Φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗)) and Ψ ∈
Fb,ﬁn(D(ST )),
⟨Φ, dΓb(ST )Ψ⟩= lim

(5.69)
(iii) Let {en|n ∈N} ⊂D(T ∗) be a CONS of K .
Then, for all Ψ ∈
Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗T )),
∥dΓb(T ∗T )1/2Ψ∥2 =
∞
X
n=1
∥A(T ∗en)Ψ∥2.
(5.70)
Proof. (i) It is suﬃcient to prove (5.67) for vectors Ψ of the form
Ψ
=
A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH , gj
∈
D(T ), m
≥

Let
LN

n=1 A(Sen)∗A(T ∗en). Then, by direct computations using CCR, we have
LNΨ =

A(g1)∗· · · A(SPNgj)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH ,
where PN is a linear operator from H to K given by
D(PN) := H ,
PNf :=
N
X
n=1
⟨T ∗en, f⟩en, f ∈H .
5Note that D(ST) = D(T). Hence ST is densely deﬁned.
 

238
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Since {en}n is a CONS of K , it follows that, for all f ∈D(T ), PNf →T f
(N →∞). Hence, by the boundedness of S, SPNf →ST f (N →∞).
Therefore, by Lemma 5.13(iii),
lim
N→∞LNΨ =
m
X
j=1
A(g1)∗· · · A(ST gj)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH = dΓb(ST )Ψ.
Thus (5.67) is obtained.
Formula (5.68) is just the case of (5.67) with K = H and S = T = I.
(ii) Let Φ := A(h1)∗· · · A(hm)∗ΩH (hj ∈D(S∗), j = 1, · · · , m). Then
⟨Φ, LNΨ⟩=
m

j=1
X

hj, SPNgσ(j)

On the other hand,

hj, SPNgσ(j)

=

S∗hj, PNgσ(j)

. Hence
lim
N→∞

hj, SPNgσ(j)

=

S∗hj, T gσ(j)

=

hj, ST gσ(j)

.
Therefore ⟨Φ, LNΨ⟩→⟨Φ, dΓb(ST )Ψ⟩(N →∞). Thus (5.69) follows.
(iii) By taking S = T ∗and Φ = Ψ in (5.69) and using the fact that
⟨Ψ, dΓb(T ∗T )Ψ⟩= ∥dΓb(T ∗T )1/2Ψ∥2, we obtain (5.70).
5.8.6
Inﬁnite series representation for the square root of a
second quantization operator
In the case where H is separable and T is self-adjoint, one can use the
multiplication operator form of spectral theorem (Theorem 3.11) to obtain
more detailed results. Let (X, Σ, µ), U and F be as in Theorem 3.11. Then
we have the natural isomorphism (see Theorem 5.6(ii) and Example 5.2):
Fb(H )
Γb(U)
∼=
Fb(L2(X, dµ)) ∼= ⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dµn).
Let W : Fb(H ) →⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dµn) be the natural isomorphism
just mentioned and
dΓW
b (T ) := WdΓb(T )W −1
AW (f) := WA(f)W −1,
f ∈H .
Then, by Examples 5.2 and 5.3,
dΓW
b (T ) = ⊕∞

(5.71)
where Fn is a function on Xn given by

and MFn is the multiplication operator by the function Fn.

(5.72)
We are now ready to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 5.21. Assume that H be separable. Let T be a non-negative
self-adjoint operator and {en}∞
n=1 ⊂D(T 1/2) be a CONS of H . Then, for
all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2), P∞
n=1 ∥A(T 1/2en)Ψ∥2 < ∞and
∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥2 =
∞
X
n=1
∥A(T 1/2en)Ψ∥2.
(5.73)
In particular, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
),
∥N 1/2
b
Ψ∥2 =
∞
X
n=1
∥A(en)Ψ∥2.
(5.74)
Proof. Equation (5.73) is equivalent to
∥dΓW
b (T )1/2Φ∥2 =
∞
X
n=1
∥AW (en)Φ∥2,
Φ ∈D(dΓW
b (T )1/2).
(5.75)
Hence we prove this formula.
We ﬁrst remark that the non-negativity of T implies that of F: F ≥0.
Let Φ ∈D(dΓW

cm :=

By the permutation symmetry of Φ(m)(x1, . . . , xm) in (x1, . . . , xm), we have

Z
Xm |F(x1)1/2Φ(m)(x1, . . . , xm)|2dµm(x1, . . . , xm) < ∞.
By (5.72) and Fubini’s theorem, one can make the following calculation:

Since {Uen}n is a CONS of L2(X, dµ) and F 1/2(·)Φ(m+1)(·, x2, . . . , xm+1)
∈L2(X, dµ), it follows from the Parseval equality that

where we have used the permutation symmetry of Φ(m+1).
Thus
P∞
n=1 ∥AW (T 1/2en)Φ∥2 < ∞and (5.75) holds.
Considering the case where T = I in (5.73), we obtain (5.74).

5.9
The Segal Field Operator
Operators made from the boson creation and annihilation operators are
main objects for analysis on the boson Fock space. Among those operators,
a simple and natural one may be A(f) + A(f)∗with f ∈H . It is obvious
that Fb,0(H ) ⊂D(A(f) + A(f)∗) and A(f) + A(f)∗is symmetric. Hence
one can deﬁne a closed symmetric operator
ΦS(f) :=
1
√
2
(A(f) + A(f)∗),
f ∈H ,
(5.76)
where the constant 1/
√
2 is just for convenience. The operator ΦS(f) is
called the Segal ﬁeld operator with test vector f, which plays a funda-
mental role in applications to Bose ﬁeld theory. The purpose of this section
is to investigate properties of the Segal ﬁeld operator.
5.9.1
Basic properties
Proposition 5.12. Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint op-
erator on H .
(i) For all f ∈D(T −1/2), D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(ΦS(f)) and, for all Ψ ∈
D(dΓb(T )1/2),
ΦS(f)Ψ =
1
√
2
(A(f) + A(f)∗)Ψ
(5.77)
and
∥ΦS(f)Ψ∥≤

2∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥+ 1

∥f∥∥Ψ∥
(5.78)

.
(5.79)
(iii) For all f, g ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ), ΦS(f)ΦS(g) is dΓb(T )-bounded, i.e.,
there exists a constant cT (f, g) ≥0 such that
∥ΦS(f)ΦS(g)Ψ∥≤cT (f, g)∥(dΓb(T ) + 1)Ψ∥.
(5.80)
Proof. (i) Let f
∈
D(T −1/2).
Then Theorem 5.16 implies that
D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(ΦS(f)) and (5.77) holds. Hence
∥ΦS(f)Ψ∥≤
1
√
2(∥A(f)Ψ∥+ ∥A(f)∗Ψ∥).
 

242
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then, using (5.43) and (5.44), we obtain (5.78).
(ii) This follows from (i) in the case T = I.
(iii) We have
ΦS(f)ΦS(g) = 1
2(A(f)A(g) + A(f)A(g)∗+ A(f)∗A(g) + A(f)∗A(g)∗)
on ∩#,♮=∅,∗D(A(f)#A(g)♮). Then, applying Theorem 5.18 to each term
on the right hand side, we see that ΦS(f)ΦS(g) is dΓb(T )-bounded (the
constant cT (f, g) in (5.80) can be explicitly written down, but we do not
need it in the present book).
Let
Db := ∩f∈H D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗).
(5.81)
Then
D(N 1/2
b
) ⊂Db.
The real linearity of A(f)# in f implies that of the correspondence: f 7→
ΦS(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈Db):
ΦS(af + bg)Ψ = (aΦS(f) + bΦS(g)) Ψ, a, b ∈R, f, g ∈H , Ψ ∈Db.
Remark 5.10. For any non-real α, if f ̸= 0 (f ∈H ), then ΦS(αf) ̸=
αΦS(f) (Problem 7). Namely the correspondence: f 7→ΦS(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈Db)
is not complex linear. This is because the correspondence: f 7→A(f)Ψ
(Ψ ∈Db) is anti-linear: A(αf)Ψ = α∗A(f)Ψ, α ∈C.
Proposition 5.13. For all f ∈H \ {0}, ΦS(f) is neither bounded from
below nor bounded from above.
Proof. For each N ∈N, we deﬁne ΨN(f) ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ) by Ψ(n)
N (f) =
(
√
2∥f∥n)−1 ⊗n f for n = N, N + 1 and Ψ(n)
N (f) = 0 for n ̸= N, N + 1.
Then ∥ΨN(f)∥= 1 and
⟨ΨN, A(f)∗ΨN⟩=

1

2∥f∥N+1 ⊗N+1 f,
√
N + 1
√
2∥f∥N ⊗N+1 f

= ∥f∥
2
√
N + 1.
Hence ⟨ΨN, A(f)ΨN⟩= ⟨ΨN, A(f)∗ΨN⟩∗=
√
N + 1∥f∥/2. Therefore
⟨ΨN(f), ΦS(f)ΨN(f)⟩=
√
N + 1∥f∥
√
2
→∞(N →∞).
 

Boson Fock Spaces
243
Hence ΦS(f) is not bounded from above.
Since ΦS(−f) = −ΦS(f), it
follows that ∥ΨN(−f)∥= 1 and
⟨ΨN(−f), ΦS(f)ΨN(−f)⟩= −
√
N + 1
√
2
∥f∥→−∞(N →∞).
Hence ΦS(f) is not bounded from below.
We have for all f ∈H and Ψ ∈D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗)
ΦS(if)Ψ =
i
√
2
(A(f)∗−A(f))Ψ.
(5.82)
By this formula and (5.76), we obtain the following relations: for all Ψ ∈
D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗),
A(f)∗Ψ =
1
√
2
(ΦS(f) −iΦS(if))Ψ,
(5.83)
A(f)Ψ =
1
√
2(ΦS(f) + iΦS(if))Ψ.
(5.84)
These are formulae recovering A(·)# from Segal ﬁeld operators.
Proposition 5.14.
(i) For each f ∈H , ΦS(f) leaves Fb,0(H ) invariant and obeys commu-
tation relations
[ΦS(f), ΦS(g)] = iIm ⟨f, g⟩,
f, g ∈H
(5.85)
on Fb,0(H ).
(ii) Let D be a subspace of H .
Then, for each f ∈D, ΦS(f) leaves
Fb,ﬁn(D) invariant.
(iii) Let D be a subspace of H and
PΦS(D) := span

ΩH , ΦS(f1) · · · ΦS(fn)ΩH
 n ≥1,
fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , n

.
Then
Fb,ﬁn(D) = PΦS(D).
(5.86)
In particular, if D is dense, then PΦS(D) is dense in Fb(H ).
(iv) (continuity) Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H .
Suppose that fn, f ∈D(T −1/2) and fn →f, T −1/2fn →
T −1/2f (n →∞).
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2), ΦS(fn)Ψ →
ΦS(f)Ψ (n →∞).
 

244
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) This follows from Proposition 5.5(i) and Theorem 5.13.
(ii) By Corollary 5.8, for all f ∈D, A(f)#Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D). Hence
ΦS(f)Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).
(iii) Let fj ∈D (j = 1, . . . , n). Then, by direct computations, we have
ΦS(f1) · · · ΦS(fn)ΩH =
X
2n terms
1
2n/2 A(f1)# · · · A(fn)#ΩH ,
Using (5.34), (5.35) and (5.28), we see that the vector on the right hand
side is in Fb,ﬁn(D). Hence PΦS(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).
Conversely, let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ∈Fb,ﬁn(D) (fj ∈D, j =
1, . . . , n). Then, using (5.83), we see that the vector on the right hand side
is in PΦS(D). Hence Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂PΦS(D). Thus Fb,ﬁn(D) = PΦS(D).
(iii) This follows from Lemma 5.13(i) and (ii).
5.9.2
Self-adjointness of the Segal ﬁeld operator
Now we prove a non-trivial important fact:
Theorem 5.22. Let f ∈H . Then ΦS(f) is self-adjoint. Moreover, for
any dense subspace D of H , Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for ΦS(f).
Proof. For instructive reasons, we give two diﬀerent proofs.
(I) First proof. Since ΦS(f) is a closed symmetric operator, it is suﬃcient
to show that ΦS(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(D).
Let f ̸= 0.
Then one can write ΦS(f) = (∥f∥/
√
2)ΦS(F) with F :=
√
2f/∥f∥. We
have ∥F∥=
√
2. Hence it is enough to show that ΦS(f) with ∥f∥=
√
2 is
essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(D).
We ﬁrst prove the essential self-adjointness of ΦS(f) on Fb,ﬁn(D) for
f ∈D with ∥f∥=
√
2. By Proposition 1.19, we need only to prove that
the range of B± := (ΦS(f) ± i) ↾Fb,ﬁn(D) is dense in Fb(H ).
Let f0 := if/
√
2. Then f0 ∈D and ∥f0∥= 1. Also one can write
B± = i(−A(f0)∗+ A(f0) ± 1) on Fb,ﬁn(D). Let Ψ ∈Ran(B+)⊥. Then
⟨Ψ, B+Φ⟩= 0 for all Φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D) · · · (∗).
Let H0 := span {f0}. For each h ∈D, we have the orthogonal decom-
position
h = α(h)f0 + h⊥
with α(h) := ⟨f0, h⟩and h⊥:= h −α(h)f0 ∈H ⊥
0 . Since h and f0 are
in D, h⊥∈D ∩H ⊥
0 . Using this decomposition, we have for all hj ∈D

conditions {i1, . . . , ik}∩{j1, . . . , jN−k} = ∅and {i1, . . . , ik, j1, . . . , jN−k} =
{1, . . . , N}. Therefore Fb,ﬁn(D) is algebraically spanned by vectors of the
form
Ψn,m := (A(f0)∗)nA(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH (n, m ≥0)
with gj ∈D ∩H ⊥
0
(j = 1, . . . , m). By (5.33), we have
∥Ψn,m∥=
√
n!Cm,
Cm := ∥A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH ∥.
Fixing m and g = (g1, . . . , gm) arbitrarily with Cm ̸= 0, we deﬁne a unit
vector
Φn :=
Ψn,m
∥Ψn,m∥∈Fb,ﬁn(D).
Then, by (5.33) again , we see that {Φn}∞
n=0 is an ONS in Fb(H ). Taking
Φ = Φn in (∗) and putting an := ⟨Ψ, Φn⟩, we have the recursion relation
√
n + 1an+1 = √n an−1 + an,
n ≥0
with a−1 := 0. Hence, in particular, a0 = a1.
Suppose that a0 ̸= 0. Then, putting bn := an/a0, we have b0 = b1 = 1
and
√
n + 1bn+1 = √n bn−1 + bn.
By induction in n, we can show that bn ≥1 for all n ≥1.
Hence
P∞
n=1 |bn|2 = ∞. Since {Φn}n is an ONS in Fb(H ) as remarked above,
the Bessel inequality implies that P∞
n=1 |bn|2 ≤∥Ψ∥2/a2
0. But this is a
contradiction. Hence a0 = 0. Therefore a1 = 0. By the recursion relation
on {an}n, we obtain an = 0 for all n ≥0. Namely ⟨Ψ, Φn⟩= 0 for all n ≥0.
Since m is arbitrary, it follows that ⟨Ψ, η⟩= 0 for all η ∈Fb,ﬁn(D). Hence
Ψ = 0. Therefore Ran(B+) is dense in Fb(H ).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let Ψ ∈Ran(B−)⊥next. Then we have
√
n + 1an+1 = √n an−1 −an,
n ≥0.
Hence, putting cn := (−1)nan, we obtain
√
n + 1cn+1 = √n cn−1 + cn.
Hence, by the preceding result, cn = 0 and hence an = 0.
Therefore
Ran(B−) is dense in Fb(H ). Thus, for f ∈D, ΦS(f) is essentially self-
adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(D).
Finally we consider the case where f is a general element of H . Apply-
ing the preceding result to the case D = H , we see that ΦS(f) is essentially
self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(H ) and ΦS(f) is self-adjoint with
ΦS(f) = ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(H ).
(5.87)
Since D is dense in H , for each Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ), there exists a sequence
{ΨN}∞
N=1 in Fb,ﬁn(D) such that ΨN →Ψ (N →∞). By Lemma 5.7(i) and
(ii), ΦS(f)ΨN →ΦS(f)Ψ (N →∞). This means that ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(H ) ⊂
ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(D). By this relation and (5.87), we obtain
ΦS(f) = ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(D).
Thus Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for ΦS(f).
(II) Second proof. One can apply Theorem 1.27. We ﬁrst show that, for
all f ∈H , Fb,0(H ) is a set of entire analytic vectors of ΦS(f).
Let n ≥1 and f ∈H . Then we have
ΦS(f)n =

Then

By d’Alembert’s ratio test, the inﬁnite series on the right hand side con-
verges. Hence Ψk ∈E (ΦS(f)) (the set of entire analytic vectors of ΦS(f);
see Section 1.7). Since any vector in Fb,0(H ) is a linear combination of
vectors of the form Ψk (k ≥0), it follows that Fb,0(H ) ⊂E (ΦS(f)). It is
obvious that ΦS(f)Fb,0(H ) ⊂Fb,0(H ). Hence, by Theorem 1.27, ΦS(f)
is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,0(H ) and hence ΦS(f) is self-adjoint.
Since Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,0(H ) and Fb,ﬁn(D) is dense in Fb(H ), it fol-
lows from an argument similar to that of the second half of Proof (I) that
Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for ΦS(f).
Remark 5.11. One can also prove Theorem 5.22 by an application of the
commutator theorem [Reed and Simon (1975), Theorem X.37] with the
dominating operator being the boson number operator Nb.
5.9.3
Irreducibility of Segal ﬁeld operators
We next consider the irreducibility of Segal ﬁeld operators.
Theorem 5.23. For any dense subspace D of H , {ΦS(f)|f ∈D} is irre-
ducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{ΦS(f)|f ∈D}′. Then, for all f ∈D, T ΦS(f) ⊂ΦS(f)T .
Let Df := D(A(f)∗) = D(A(f)) (see Corollary 5.6). Hence, for all Ψ, Φ ∈
Df,
⟨Ψ, T (A(f)∗+ A(f))Φ⟩= ⟨(A(f) + A(f)∗)Ψ, T Φ⟩.
Replacing f by if, one has
⟨Ψ, T (A(f)∗−A(f))Φ⟩= ⟨(A(f) −A(f)∗)Ψ, T Φ⟩.
From these two equations, one obtains
⟨Ψ, T A(f)∗Φ⟩= ⟨A(f)Ψ, T Φ⟩,
⟨Ψ, T A(f)Φ⟩= ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, T Φ⟩.
The ﬁrst equation implies that T Φ ∈D(A(f)∗) and T A(f)∗Φ = A(f)∗T Φ,
i.e., T A(f)∗⊂A(f)∗T . Similarly the second equation implies that T A(f) ⊂
A(f)T . Hence T ∈{A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈D}′ = CI (by Theorem 5.14), i.e.,
T = cI for some c ∈C. Thus {ΦS(f)|f ∈D} is irreducible.

Exponential Operator for a General Linear Operator
Since ΦS(f) (f ∈H ) is self-adjoint, one can consider, via the functional
calculus, an exponential operator
ezΦS(f) =
Z
R
ezλdEΦS(f)(λ)
with z ∈C, which is a densely deﬁned closed operator on Fb(H ) (apply
Theorem 1.16(iii)). But it is not necessarily bounded (see Proposition 5.16
below) . We next study operators of this type. For this purpose, we take
here a mathematical interlude.
In view of Lemma 1.6, it would be natural to extend the concept of ex-
ponential operator to a not necessarily self-adjoint operator A on a Hilbert
space X as follows:
D(exp A) :=
(
Ψ ∈C∞(A) |
∞
X
n=0
∥AnΨ∥
n!
< ∞
)
,
(exp A)Ψ :=
∞
X
n=0
1
n!AnΨ,
Ψ ∈D(exp A).
It is obvious that, for all z ∈C, E (A) ⊂D(exp zA) and
exp(zA)Ψ =
∞
X
n=0
zn
n! AnΨ,
Ψ ∈E (A).
Remark 5.12. Let A ∈B(X ). Then
∞
X
n=0

n!∥An∥≤

X
n=0
∥A∥n
n!
= e∥A∥< ∞.
Hence D(exp A) = X and exp A ∈B(X ). Moreover, it is easy to see that
exp A is bijective with (exp A)−1 = exp(−A).
Remark 5.13. It is easy to see that, if A is self-adjoint, then, for all z ∈C,
exp zA ⊂ezA. To avoid confusion, we use the symbol ezA only in the case
where A is self-adjoint.
We recall a concept on inﬁnite series in a Hilbert space. For a sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=0 in a Hilbert space X , the inﬁnite series P∞
n=0 Ψn is said to be
absolutely convergent if P∞
n=0 ∥Ψn∥X < ∞. In that case, it is easy to
see that Φ := P∞
n=0 Ψn converges in X and, for each bijection σ : Z+ →
Z+, Φσ := P∞
n=0 Ψσ(n) is absolutely convergent with Φσ = Φ.

A double sequence {Ψn,m}∞

Φn := P∞

Let A be a linear operator on X . We say that A strongly commutes
with a bounded linear operator C ∈B(X ) if CA ⊂AC.
Lemma 5.14. Let C ∈B(X ) such that CA ⊂AC (i.e. A strongly com-
mutes with C). Then:
(i) D(exp(A + C)) = D(exp A) and
exp(A + C)Ψ = (exp C)(exp A)Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(exp A).
(5.89)
(ii) If A is closed, then (exp C)D(exp A) ⊂D(exp A) and
exp(A + C)Ψ = (exp A)(exp C)Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(exp A).
(5.90)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(exp A). By the assumption for C, CD(A) ⊂D(A) and
ACη = CAη for all η ∈D(A). Hence, for all n, m ∈N, AnCmΨ = CmAnΨ
and

Hence S1 := P∞
n,m=0(1/n!m!)AnCmΨ and S2 = P∞
n,m=0(1/n!m!)CmAnΨ
are absolutely convergent and S1 = S2.
(i) By the strong commutativity of A with C, for all n ∈N,
(A + C)nΨ =
n
X
r=0
nCrCn−rArΨ,
where nCr is deﬁned by (2.52). Hence
∥(A + C)nΨ∥≤

nCr∥C∥n−r∥ArΨ∥.

Therefore

n!∥(A + C)nΨ∥≤e∥C∥

∥ArΨ∥

implying that Ψ ∈D(exp(A + C)).
Thus D(exp A) ⊂D(exp(A + C)).
Replacing A and C by A+C and −C respectively (note that (−C)(A+C) ⊂
(A + C)(−C)), we obtain D(exp(A + C)) ⊂D(exp A). Thus D(exp(A +
C)) = D(exp A). We have
exp(A + C)Ψ =

By the closedness of A, we can show inductively in n that (exp C)Ψ ∈

n=0

n!∥An(exp C)Ψ∥≤

Hence (exp C)Ψ ∈D(exp A) and (5.90) holds.
For two linear operators A and B on X , we introduce
C∞(A, B) := ∩n,m≥0D(AnBm).
and
D(A, B) :=
(
Ψ ∈C∞(A, B) |

It is obvious that
D(A, B) ⊂D(exp A) ∩D(exp B).
Lemma 5.15. Suppose that A is closed.
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(A, B),
(exp B)Ψ ∈D(exp A) and
(exp A)(exp B)Ψ =

X
n,m=0

n!m!AnBmΨ,
(5.91)
where the right hand side is absolutely convergent.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
251
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(A, B).
Then, Φ := P∞
m=0 ABmΨ/m! converges.
Hence, by the closedness of A, (exp B)Ψ ∈D(A) and A(exp B)Ψ = Φ =
limM→∞ΦM with ΦM := PM
m=0(1/m!)ABmΨ. Similarly AΦM converges
to P∞
m=0 A2BmΨ/m!. Hence, by the closedness of A, A(exp B)Ψ ∈D(A)
and A2(exp B)Ψ = P∞
m=0 A2BmΨ/m!. In a similar way, we can prove in-
ductively in n that, for all n ∈N, (exp B)Ψ ∈D(An) and An(exp B)Ψ =
P∞
m=0 AnBmΨ/m!. Hence
∥An(exp B)Ψ∥≤

m=0

implying that P∞

Therefore (exp B)Ψ ∈

5.10.1
Commutation relations
In this subsection, we consider a pair (A, B) of linear operators on X which
has the following property:
(AB) There exist a subspace D ⊂D(A) ∩D(B) and a bounded oper-
ator C ∈B(X ) satisfying the following conditions:
(i) The operators A and B leave D invariant: AD ⊂D and BD ⊂D.
(ii) [A, B] = C on D (hence CD ⊂D by (i)) and CA = AC and
CB = BC on D.
Remark 5.14. Let Dc be a dense subspace of X such that Dc ⊂D(AB) ∩
D(BA). Suppose that there exists a bijective operator Z ∈B(X ) such that
(i) [A, B] = Z on Dc;(ii) ZDc ⊂D(A) ∩D(B) and AZ = ZA, BZ = ZB
on Dc.
Then at least one of A and B is unbounded.
This proposition
can be easily proved by applying a well-known theorem in the theory of
commutation relations (see, e.g., [Putnam (1967), Theorem 1.2.2]). Thus,
for a pair (A, B) obeying (AB), at least one of A and B is unbounded if D
is dense and C is bijective.
Lemma 5.16. Assume (AB). Suppose that B is closed and D ⊂D(exp A).
Then, (exp A)D ⊂D(B) and, for all Ψ ∈D,
(exp A)BΨ = (B + C)(exp A)Ψ.
(5.92)
Proof. Since BΨ ∈D ⊂D(exp A), we have
(exp A)BΨ =
∞
X
n=0
1
n!AnBΨ.
(5.93)
 

252
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By property (AB), we have
AnBΨ = An−1([A, B] + BA)Ψ = CAn−1Ψ + An−1B(AΨ).
Iterating this formula, we obtain
AnBΨ = nCAn−1Ψ + BAnΨ.
(5.94)
Hence, for all N ∈N,
N
X
n=0
1
n!AnBΨ = CΦN−1Ψ + BΦN
with ΦN := PN
n=0(1/n!)AnΨ. By (5.93), limN→∞
PN
n=0(1/n!)AnBΨ =
(exp A)BΨ. We have limN→∞ΦN = (exp A)Ψ. Hence, by the boundedness
of C, CΦN−1 →C(exp A)Ψ (N →∞). Therefore BΦN →(exp A)BΨ −
C(exp A)Ψ (N →∞). Since B is closed, it follows that (exp A)Ψ ∈D(B)
and (5.92) holds.
The next proposition is concerned with commutation relation of exp A
and exp B:
Proposition 5.15. Assume (AB). Suppose that B and exp A is closed,
D ⊂D(exp A) ∩D(exp B) and (exp A)D ⊂D(exp B). Then, (exp B)D ⊂
D(exp A) and, for all Ψ ∈D
(exp A)(exp B)Ψ = (exp C)(exp B)(exp A)Ψ.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D.
Using (5.92) repeatedly, we obtain (exp A)BnΨ =
(B + C)n(exp A)Ψ for all n ∈N. Hence
(exp A)χN =
N
X
n=0
1
n!(B + C)n(exp A)Ψ,
where χN
:= PN
n=0(1/n!)BnΨ.
By the condition that (exp A)Ψ ∈
D(exp B) = D(exp(B + C)), the right hand side converges to (exp(B +
C))(exp A)Ψ as N →∞. Since χN →(exp B)Ψ as N →∞and exp A is
closed by the present assumption, it follows that (exp B)Ψ ∈D(exp A) and
(exp A)(exp B)Ψ = exp(B + C)(exp A)Ψ. In the same way as in the proof
of Lemma 5.14, one can show that exp(B + C)Ψ = (exp C)(exp B)Ψ. Thus
the desired result follows.

Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula
We next examine how exp(A+B) is expressed in terms of exp A and exp B.
For this purpose, we ﬁrst prove a useful formula for non-commutative
operators.
Lemma 5.17. Let A be an algebra over C and X, Y, Z be elements in A
satisfying [X, Y ] = Z, XZ = ZX and Y Z = ZY . Then, for all n ∈N,

(5.95)
where nCk is the binomial coeﬃcient (see (2.52)).
Proof. We prove (5.95) by induction in n. In the case n = 1, the both
sides of (5.95) are equal to (X + Y ).
Suppose that (5.95) holds for an n ∈N. Let the left hand side of (5.95)
be Ln. By the recursion formula
n+1Ck = nCk + nCk−1,
k = 1, . . . , n,
(5.96)
and the induction hypothesis, we have
Ln+1 =
X
k,r≥0
2r+k=n
n!
k!r!
Z
2
r
{X(X + Y )k + (X + Y )kY }.
On the other hand, using the commutation relation [X, Y ] = Z, we obtain
X(X + Y )k = kZ(X + Y )k−1 + (X + Y )kX,
k ≥1.
Hence
Ln+1 = 2

(k −1)!r! + 2

k!(r −1)!,
r, k ≥1.
Putting this into the above equation, we see that Ln+1 is equal to the right
hand side of (5.95) with n replaced by n + 1. Thus (5.95) holds with n
replaced by n + 1.
Theorem 5.24. Assume (AB). Suppose that D ⊂D(A, B)∩D(exp(A+B))
and A is closed. Then, for all Ψ ∈D
exp(A + B)Ψ = exp(−C/2)(exp A)(exp B)Ψ.
(5.97)

(exp A)(exp B)Ψ =

(A + B)mΨ = exp(C/2) exp(A + B)Ψ.
Then, by Remark 5.12, (5.97) is obtained.
Remark 5.15. If A and B are bounded in Theorem 5.24, then one can
take D = X . Hence operator equality
exp(A + B) = exp(−C/2)(exp A)(exp B)
holds. This is a special form of the so-called Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ
(BCH) formula. Hence (5.97) gives a generalization of it to the case where
A and B are not necessarily bounded (see Remark 5.14).

Exponential Operators for Segal Field Operators
Now we come back to the boson Fock space Fb(H ). We have seen that,
for each f ∈H , ΦS(f) is self-adjoint. Hence, for all t ∈R, eitΦS(f) is a
unitary operator on Fb(H ). The unitary operator eitΦS(f) is called the
Weyl operator with f. But, for a non-zero complex number z which is
not purely imaginary, ezΦS(f) with f ̸= 0 is unbounded:
Proposition 5.16. Let f ∈H and f ̸= 0.
(i) For all t ∈R \ {0}, etΦS(f) is an unbounded non-negative self-adjoint
operator and injective with (etΦS(f))−1 = e−tΦS(f).
(ii) For all z = a + ib ∈C with a, b ∈R, a ̸= 0, ezΦS(f) is a densely deﬁned
unbounded closed operator and (ezΦS(f))∗= ez∗ΦS(f) and injective with
(ezΦS(f))−1 = e−zΦS(f).
Proof. (i) The function : R ∋λ 7→etλ is strictly positive and continuous.
Hence, by Corollary 1.4(ii), etΦS is a non-negative injective self-adjoint
operator with (etΦS(f))−1 = e−tΦS(f). By Proposition 5.13, ΦS(f) is neither
bounded from below nor bounded from above. Hence, by an application of
Proposition 1.34(ii), etΦS(f) is unbounded for all t ∈R \ {0}.
(ii) The function : R ∋λ 7→ezλ is continuous and |ezλ| = eaλ > 0, λ ∈
R. Hence, by the functional calculus, ezΦS(f) is a densely deﬁned closed
operator and (ezΦS(f))∗= ez∗ΦS(f) since (ezλ)∗= ez∗λ. The injectivity of
ezΦS(f) follows from an application of Corollary 1.4(i).
By the functional calculus, we have ezΦS(f) = eibΦS(f)eaΦS(f). Hence,
for all Ψ ∈D(ezΦS(f)) = D(eaΦS), ∥ezΦS(f)Ψ∥= ∥eaΦS(f)Ψ∥. This im-
plies that, if ezΦS(f) is bounded, then so is eaΦS(f). But, by (i), eaΦS(f) is
unbounded. Thus ezΦS(f) is unbounded.
For a subspace D of H , we introduce a subspace F ∞(D) of Fb(H )
as follows:
F ∞(D) :=
\
n∈N,fj∈D
j=1,··· ,n,#=∗,∅
D(A(f1)# · · · A(fn)#).
Obviously we have
Fb,0(H ) ⊂F ∞(H ).

Therefore ezΦS(f)Ψ ∈E (ΦS(g)). It follows from (5.101) that the inﬁnite
series on the right hand side of (5.100) with X = wΦS(g) and Y = zΦS(f)
absolutely converges. By this fact and the preceding result, we see that
(5.100) with X = wΦS(g) and Y = zΦS(f) holds. Similarly one can prove
the statement of (iii) in the other cases.
Now we are ready to prove important facts on exponential operators for
the Segal ﬁeld operator.
Theorem 5.25. Let f, g ∈H .
(i) For all z ∈C and Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ),
ezΦS(f+g)Ψ = e−iz2Im⟨f,g⟩/2ezΦS(f)ezΦS(g)Ψ.
(5.102)
(ii) The following operator equalities hold:
eiΦS(f+g) = eiIm⟨f,g⟩/2eiΦS(f)eiΦS(g),
(5.103)
eiΦS(f)eiΦS(g) = e−iIm⟨f,g⟩eiΦS(g)eiΦS(f).
(5.104)
(iii) (strong continuity) Let fn ∈H and fn →f (n →∞). Then
s- lim
n→∞eiΦS(fn) = eiΦS(f).
(5.105)
 

258
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(iv) (irreducibility) For any dense subspace D ⊂H , {eiΦS(f)|f ∈D} is
irreducible.
Proof. (i) Let A = ΦS(f), B = ΦS(g), D = Fb,0(H ) and X = Fb(H ).
Then the pair (A, B) satisﬁes property (AB) in Subsection 5.10.1 with
C = iIm ⟨f, g⟩.
Let Ψ ∈D.
Then, by Lemma 5.18 ( the inﬁnite
series expansion for ezΦS(f+g)Ψ), one can easily see that ezΦS(f+g)Ψ =
exp(zA + zB)Ψ. By Lemma 5.18 again, one sees that the assumption of
Theorem 5.24 is satisﬁed in the present case. Hence exp(zA + zB)Ψ =
e−iz2Im ⟨f,g⟩/2 exp(zA) exp(zB)Ψ. Hence (5.102) holds.
(ii) Taking z = i in (5.102), we have (5.103) on Fb,0(H ).
Since
Fb,0(H ) is dense in Fb(H ) and eiΦS(h) (h ∈H ) is bounded, operator
equality (5.103) follows from Theorem 1.2.
By (5.103) and eiΦS(f+g) = eiΦS(g+f), we have
eiIm⟨f,g⟩/2eiΦS(f)eiΦS(g) = eiIm⟨g,f⟩/2eiΦS(g)eiΦS(f).
By this relation and the fact that Im ⟨f, g⟩= −Im ⟨g, f⟩, we obtain (5.104).
(iii) Let Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ). Then, by direct computation, we have
∥eiΦS(fn)Ψ −eiΦS(f)Ψ∥2 = 2∥Ψ∥2 −2Re
D
Ψ, e−iΦS(fn)eiΦS(f)Ψ

.
By (5.103),
e−iΦS(fn)eiΦS(f)Ψ = eiIm ⟨fn,f⟩/2eiΦS(f−fn)Ψ.
Hence
∥eiΦS(fn)Ψ −eiΦS(f)Ψ∥2 = 2∥Ψ∥2 −2Re

eiIm ⟨fn,f⟩/2 D

We have limn→∞Im ⟨fn, f⟩= Im ∥f∥2 = 0.
By Proposition 1.33 and
Proposition 5.14(iv) with T = I,
∥eiΦS(f−fn)Ψ −Ψ∥≤∥ΦS(f −fn)Ψ∥→0 (n →∞).
Hence the right hand side of the above equation converges to 0 as n →∞.
Thus
lim
n→∞eiΦS(fn)Ψ = eiΦS(f)Ψ.
Since Fb,0(H ) is dense in Fb(H ) and supn≥1 ∥eiΦS(fn)∥= 1 < ∞, a
simple application of Proposition A.3 in Appendix A gives (5.105).
(iv) Let T ∈{eiΦS(f)|f ∈D}′.
Then, for all f ∈D, t ∈R and
Ψ ∈D(ΦS(f)), T eitΦS(f)Ψ = eitΦS(f)T Ψ.
Since eitΦS(f)Ψ is strongly
diﬀerentiable in t and T is bounded, it follows that eitΦS(f)T Ψ also is
 

Boson Fock Spaces
259
strongly diﬀerentiable in t. Hence, considering the strong diﬀerentiation
of the above equation at t = 0, one obtains that T Ψ ∈D(ΦS(f)) and
T ΦS(f)Ψ = ΦS(f)T Ψ. This means that T ΦS(f) ⊂ΦS(f)T .
Therefore
T ∈{ΦS(f)|f ∈D}′. Hence, by Theorem 5.23, T = cI for some c ∈C.
Thus {eiΦS(f)|f ∈D} is irreducible.
Commutation property (5.104) for the Weyl operators eiΦS(f) and
eiΦS(g) is called the Weyl relation for ΦS(f) and ΦS(g).
As a corollary to Theorem 5.25, we obtain an important result:
Corollary 5.11 (strong commutativity). Let f, g ∈H . Then ΦS(f)
and ΦS(g) strongly commute if and only if Im ⟨f, g⟩= 0.
Proof. Suppose that ΦS(f) and ΦS(g) strongly commute. Then, by Propo-
sition 1.36, for all s, t ∈R, eitΦS(f)eisΦS(g) = eisΦS(g)eitΦS(f). Hence, by
(5.104), e−itsIm ⟨f,g⟩= 1 for all s, t ∈R. Hence Im ⟨f, g⟩= 0.
Conversely, suppose that Im ⟨f, g⟩= 0. Then Im ⟨tf, sg⟩= 0, s, t ∈
R.
Using the real linearity of ΦS(f) in f and (5.104), we obtain
eitΦS(f)eisΦS(g) = eisΦS(g)eitΦS(f). Hence, by Proposition 1.36 again, ΦS(f)
and ΦS(g) strongly commute.
5.12
Decomposition of the Segal Field Operator
Let C be a conjugation on H , i.e., C is an anti-linear mapping from H to
H satisfying (i) C2 = I and (ii) (norm preserving) ∥Cf∥= ∥f∥, f ∈H .6
Then it is easy to see that
⟨Cf, Cg⟩= ⟨g, f⟩,
f, g ∈H
and
HC := {f ∈H | Cf = f}
becomes a real Hilbert space with the inner product induced from that of
H . Note also that each f ∈H is uniquely written as
f = f1 + if2
with f1, f2 ∈HC (explicitly f1 = 1
2(f + Cf), f2 = 1
2i(f −Cf)). The vector
f1 (resp. f2) is called the real (resp. imaginary) part of f with respect to
C and written as f1 = Re f and f2 = Im f.
6A simple example of C is given as follows: Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H . Then
any ψ ∈H has the expansion ψ = P∞
n=1 ⟨en, ψ⟩en. One can deﬁne C : H →H by
Cψ := P∞
n=1 ⟨ψ, en⟩en. It is easy to see that C is a conjugation on H .

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For a subspace V of H , we deﬁne VC by
VC := V ∩HC
(5.106)
It follows that, if V is dense in H and CV ⊂V , then VC is dense in HC.
For each f ∈HC, we introduce operators φF(f) and πF(f) by
φF(f) := ΦS(f),
πF(f) := ΦS(if).
(5.107)
By the self-adjointness of ΦS(·), φF(f) and πF(f) are self-adjoint.
The Segal ﬁeld operator is recovered from φF(·) and πF(·) in the follow-
ing form: for all f ∈H ,
ΦS(f) = φF(Re f) + πF(Im f)
on Fb,0(H ). By (5.103), we have
eiΦS(f) = ei⟨Re f,Im f⟩/2eiφF(Re f)eiπF(Im f).
Proposition 5.14(i), Theorems 5.22, 5.23 and Theorem 5.25 immediately
yield the following theorem:
Theorem 5.26.
(i) For all f ∈HC, φF(f) and πF(f) are self-adjoint and leave Fb,0(H )
invariant.
(ii) For all f, g ∈HC, commutation relations
[φF(f), πF(g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
(5.108)
[φF(f), φF(g)] = 0,
[πF(f), πF(g)] = 0,
(5.109)
hold on Fb,0(H ).
(iii) For any dense subspace D ⊂HC, {eiφF(f), eiπF(f) | f ∈D} is irre-
ducible.
(iv) For any dense subspace D ⊂HC, {φF(f), πF(f)| f ∈D} is irreducible.
(v) For all f, g ∈HC,
eiφF(f+g) = eiφF(f)eiφF(g),
eiπF(f+g) = eiπF(f)eiπF(g),
eiφF(f)eiπF(g) = e−i⟨f,g⟩eiπF(g)eiφF(f),
eiφF(f)eiφF(g) = eiφF(g)eiφF(f), eiπF(f)eiπF(g) = eiπF(g)eiπF(f).
In particular, {φF(f) | f ∈HC} (resp. {πF(f) | f ∈HC}) is a family
of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators.
 

Boson Fock Spaces

Commutation relations (5.108) and (5.109) may be regarded as a gener-
alization of Heisenberg CCR with ﬁnite degrees of freedom (see Remark on
Problem 6 in Chapter 3). Indeed, if dim H = n ∈N and we take a CONS
{ej}n
j=1 of HC, then the operators Qj := ℏsφF(ej) and Pj := ℏ1−sπF(ej)
(s ∈[0, 1], j = 1, . . . , n) satisfy
[Qj, Pk] = iℏδjk, [Qj, Qk] = 0, [Pj, Pk] = 0 (j, k = 1, . . . , n)
on Fb,0(H ).
We call commutation relations (5.108) and (5.109) the Heisenberg
CCR
over HC to distinguish them from the CCR satisﬁed by A(·)#’s.7
In particular, if H is inﬁnite dimensional, then the Heisenberg CCR over
HC are said to be a Heisenberg CCR with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
Remark 5.16. In applications to quantum ﬁeld theory, φF(·) is used to
represent a quantum ﬁeld at time zero (i.e., a time-zero quantum ﬁeld).
In this context, πF(·) is called the canonical conjugate momentum of
φF(·) (see Chapter 10).
5.13
Transformations of Annihilation and Creation
Operators by Exponential Operators
Before moving on to the next theorem, we present a basic fact used in
treating commutation relations of operators.
Let A be an algebra over C and A ∈A. For n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., we deﬁne a
mapping adn(A) : A →A as follows:
ad0(A)B := B,
adn(A)B := [A, adn−1(A)B],
B ∈A, n ≥1.
The mapping adn(A) is called the adjoint operator with degree n asso-
ciated with A.
Lemma 5.19. For all A, B ∈A and N ∈N,
N
X
n=0
NCn(−1)N−nAnBAN−n = adN(A)B.
Proof. This is proved by induction in n. In this case too, formula (5.96)
is used. We leave the proof as an exercise (Problem 8).
7But the Heisenberg CCR over HC also is called simply the CCR over HC if there is
no danger of confusion.

Thus (5.110) is obtained. Similarly one can prove (5.111).
Here we recall a general fact which is often used below.
Lemma 5.20. Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces and U : H1 →H2 be
a unitary operator.
Let A1 and A2 be closed operators on H1 and H2
respectively. Suppose that, for j = 1, 2, there exists a core Dj for Aj and
the following equations hold:
UA1U −1Φ = A2Φ,
Φ ∈D2,
(5.113)
U −1A2UΨ = A1Ψ,
Ψ ∈D1.
(5.114)

263
Then operator equality
UA1U −1 = A2
(5.115)
holds.
Proof. Equation (5.113) implies that A2 ↾D2 ⊂UA1U −1. Since UA1U −1
is closed, it follows that A2 = A2 ↾D2 ⊂UA1U −1. Similarly (5.114) implies
that A1 ⊂U −1A2U. Hence UA1U −1 ⊂A2. Thus (5.115) holds.
Theorem 5.28. For all f, g ∈H , the following operator equalities hold:
eiΦS(f)A(g)e−iΦS(f) = A(g) −

A(g) −

eiΦS(f) = A(g)

The subspace Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(g) and A(g) −
i ⟨g, f⟩/
√
2 (apply Theorem 1.9). Hence, applying Lemma 5.20, we obtain
(5.116). Similarly one can derive (5.117).8
Corollary 5.12. For all f, g ∈H ,
eiΦS(g)ΦS(f)e−iΦS(g) = ΦS(f) −Im ⟨g, f⟩.
(5.118)

Then, taking the closure of this equation, we obtain (5.118).9
8Another proof is given by applying the following general fact: for any densely deﬁned
closed operator A on a Hilbert space H and any unitary operator U : H →K (K is a
Hilbert space), operator equality (UAU−1)∗= UA∗U−1 holds.
9For any closable operator A on a Hilbert space H and any unitary unitary operator
U : H →K (a Hilbert space), UAU−1 is closable and UAU−1 = U ¯

Spectrum of Segal Field Operators
We next identify the spectrum of ΦS(f).
Theorem 5.29. Let f ∈H , f ̸= 0.
(i) σ(ΦS(f)) = R.
(ii) If H is separable, then σp(ΦS(f)) = ∅.
Proof. Let t ∈R and take g = itf in (5.118). Then
eiΦS(itf)ΦS(f)e−iΦS(itf) = ΦS(f) + t∥f∥2.
Since eiΦS(itf) is unitary, it follows that
σ#(ΦS(f)) = σ#(ΦS(f) + t∥f∥2) = {λ + t∥f∥2|λ ∈σ#(ΦS(f))},
where σ#(·) is either σ(·) or σp(·).
(i) By the self-adjointness of ΦS(f), σ(ΦS(f)) ̸= ∅. Hence there exists
a λ0 ∈σ(ΦS(f)). Therefore σ(ΦS(F)) ⊃∪t∈R{λ0 + t∥f∥2} = R. Thus the
desired result follows.
(ii) Suppose that σp(ΦS(f)) ̸= ∅and λ ∈σp(ΦS(f)).
Then, for all
t ∈R, λ + t∥f∥2 ∈σp(ΦS(f)). Hence σp(ΦS(f)) is an uncountable set. If
H is separable, then Fb(H ) is separable. In general, the cardinality of
the point spectrum of a closed Hermitian operator on a separable Hilbert
space is at most countable.10 Hence we are led to a contradiction. Thus
σp(ΦS(f)) = ∅.
5.15
Transformation Laws of Creation and Annihilation
Operators with Respect to Γ-operators
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces. Let U : H →K be unitary. Then the
boson Γ-operator Γb(U) : Fb(H ) →Fb(K ) is unitary (Theorem 5.6(ii)).
For deﬁniteness, we write the annihilation operator A(·) on Fb(H ) as
AH (·).
Theorem 5.30. For all f ∈H , the following operator equalities hold:
Γb(U)AH (f)Γb(U)−1 = AK (Uf),
(5.119)
Γb(U)AH (f)∗Γb(U)−1 = AK (Uf)∗.
(5.120)
10This can be proved as follows.
Let X be a separable inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert
space and H be a closed Hermitian operator on X . Suppose that H had an uncountable
set {λα}α∈Λ ⊂R (λα ̸= λβ for α ̸= β) of eigenvalues, where Λ is an uncountable
index set. Then ⊕α∈Λ ker(H −λα) ⊂X is a non-separable Hilbert space. But this
is a contradiction, because a separable Hilbert space includes no non-separable Hilbert
space. Hence the cardinality of σp(H) is at most countable.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
265
In particular,
Γb(U)ΦS,H (f)Γb(U)−1 = ΦS,K (Uf),
(5.121)
where ΦS,H (·) is the Segal ﬁeld operator on Fb(H ).
Proof. For all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), f ∈H and n ∈N,
(Γb(U)AH (f)∗Ψ)(n) = √nSn(Uf ⊗(⊗n−1UΨ(n−1)))
= (AK (Uf)∗Γb(U)Ψ)(n).
Hence Γb(U)AH (f)∗Ψ = AK (Uf)∗Γb(U)Ψ.
For all Φ ∈Fb,0(K ),
Γb(U)−1Φ ∈Fb,0(H ).
Hence Γ(U)AH (f)∗Γb(U)−1Φ = AK (Uf)∗Φ.
Similarly, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), AH (f)∗Ψ = Γb(U)−1AK (Uf)∗Γb(U)Ψ.
Since Fb,0(H ) is a core for AH (·)∗, an application of Lemma 5.20 gives
(5.120). Taking the adjoint of (5.120), we obtain (5.119).
Operator equality (5.121) can be proved in the same way as in the proof
of Corollary 5.12.
Corollary 5.13. For all f ∈H , the following operator equalities hold:
eiπNbA(f)e−iπNb = −A(f),
(5.122)
eiπNbA(f)∗e−iπNb = −A(f)∗.
(5.123)
In particular,
eiπNbΦS(f)e−iπNb = −ΦS(f).
(5.124)
Proof. We have eiπNb = Γ(eiπ) = Γ(−I). Hence an application of Theo-
rem 5.30 to the case U = −I gives the desired results.
Formulae (5.122), (5.123) and (5.124) show that the correspondences
: A(f)# 7→−A(f)# and ΦS(f) 7→−ΦS(f) are unitarily implementable.
These facts play important roles in applications to quantum ﬁeld theory.

Time Development of Segal Field Operators and Field
Equations
In general, for a self-adjoint operator H on a Hilbert space X and a linear
operator A on X , the operator
AH(t) := eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ
(t ∈R)
is called the Heisenberg operator of A with respect to H. In the con-
text of quantum physics where H denotes a quantum Hamiltonian, A is a
 

266

physical quantity and t denotes time, AH(t) is interpreted to describe the
time development of A. This way of looking at the time development of
a quantum system is called the Heisenberg picture. On the other hand,
there is another picture, called the Schr¨odinger picture, in which the time
development of a quantum system is grasped as that of state vectors in
such a way that, if Ψ ∈X is an initial state vector (i.e., a state vector at
t = 0), then the state vector at time t is given by e−itH/ℏΨ.
Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, as we have seen, the
boson second quantization dΓb(T ) of T is self-adjoint.
In applications
to quantum ﬁeld theory, if T denotes the Hamiltonian of a boson, then
dΓb(T ) represents the Hamiltonian of a free Bose ﬁeld whose quanta con-
sist of non-interacting identical bosons. In that case, the unitary operator
e−itdΓb(T )/ℏdescribes the time development of state vectors of the system
under consideration. It is important also to consider the Heisenberg opera-
tor eitdΓb(T )/ℏAe−itdΓb(T )/ℏof a linear operator A on Fb(H ) with respect
to dΓb(T ).
Let us consider the case A = ΦS(f) with f ∈H .
Then the time
development of the Segal ﬁeld operator ΦS(f) with respect to dΓb(T ) is
given by
ΦS(t, f) := eitdΓb(T )ΦS(f)e−itdΓb(T ),
where, for notational simplicity, we replace t/ℏby t.
The purpose of this section is to study strong diﬀerentiability of ΦS(t, f)
in t and to ﬁnd diﬀerential equations it obeys.
Lemma 5.21. For all t ∈R and f ∈H , operator equality
eitdΓb(T )A(f)#e−itdΓb(T ) = A(eitT f)#
holds.
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 5.30 to U = eitT and use Theorem
5.7(i).
By Lemma 5.21, we have for all t ∈R and f ∈H
ΦS(t, f) =

(5.125)

on Db (see (5.81)). Hence we need only to examine strong diﬀerentiability
in t of the operator on the right hand side.

Lemma 5.22. Let S be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H strongly commuting with T .
Let n ∈N, f ∈D(T S−1/2T n−1) ∩
D(T n) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(S)1/2). Then the vector-valued function:R ∋t 7→
A(eitT f)#Ψ is n times strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
dn
dtn A(eitT f)#Ψ = A(ineitT T nf)#Ψ,
t ∈R,
(5.127)
where d/dt means strong diﬀerentiation in t.
Proof. We prove the statement by induction in n. So we ﬁrst consider
the case n = 1 and assume that f ∈D(T S−1/2) ∩D(T ).
Let F(t) =
A(eitT f)#Ψ. Then, for any t ∈R and ε ∈R \ {0},
F(t + ε) −F(t)

where

.
By the strong commutativity of S and T , S−1/2 strongly commutes with
T . Hence eitT S−1/2 ⊂S−1/2eitT for all t ∈R. It follows that D(T S−1/2) ∩
D(T ) ⊂D(S−1/2T ) and S−1/2T f = T S−1/2f. Hence hε(t, f) ∈D(S−1/2)
and S−1/2hε(t, f) = hε(t, S−1/2f), By Theorem 5.16, we have
∥A(hε(t, f))#Ψ∥≤∥S−1/2hε(t, f)∥∥dΓb(S)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥hε(t, f)∥∥Ψ∥
= ∥hε(t, S−1/2f)∥∥dΓb(S)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥hε(t, f)∥∥Ψ∥

g ∈D(T ),
one can show that limε→0 hε(t, g) = 0 for all g ∈D(T ). Hence F(t) is
strongly diﬀerentiable in t and (5.127) with n = 1 hods.
Suppose that the conclusion of the present lemma holds for some n ∈N.
To prove that the case n + 1 holds, let f ∈D(T S−1/2T n) ∩D(T n+1) and
G(t) = A(ineitT T nf)#Ψ. Then one can write G(t) = A(eitT g)#Ψ with
g := inT nf. By the induction hypothesis, g ∈D(T S−1/2) ∩D(T ). Hence,
by the preceding result on n = 1, G(t) is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
dG(t)/dt = A(ieitT T g)#Ψ. Thus the conclusion in the case n + 1 holds.
Remark 5.17. A standard choice for S in Lemma 5.22 is given by the case
S = I. In this case, the strong commutativity of T and S is trivial and
(5.127) holds for all f ∈D(T n) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Another simple case is
the case S = T under the condition that T is non-negative and injective.
In this case, (5.127) holds for all f ∈D(T n) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2).

The following theorem follows from (5.126) and Lemma 5.22:
Theorem 5.31. Let S be as in Lemma 5.22 and f ∈D(T S−1/2T )∩D(T 2).
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(S)1/2), the vector-valued function:R ∋t 7→

d2
dt2 ΦS(t, f)Ψ + ΦS(t, T 2f)Ψ = 0.
(5.129)
Theorem 5.31 is applied to quantum ﬁeld theory in the following
manner.
Let HC be as in Section 5.12 and T be an injective and non-negative
self-adjoint operator on H such that CT ⊂T C (i.e., for all f ∈D(T ),
Cf ∈D(T ) and T Cf = CT f, in particular, T (D(T ) ∩HC) ⊂HC). Then
it is easy to see that CT C = T . Hence, using Stone’s formula, we obtain
ET (·) = CET (·)C.
Therefore it follows that, for all Borel measurable functions G : R →C,
G(T ) = CG∗(T )C. In particular, for all real-valued Borel measurable func-
tions F, F(T ) = CF(T )C. Hence, for all f ∈D(F(T )), Cf ∈D(F(T ))
and F(T )Cf = CF(T )f. Hence F(T )(D(F(T )) ∩HC) ⊂HC.
Let φF(·) and πF(·) be the operators deﬁned by (5.107) and α ∈R.
Then (5.108) and (5.109) imply the following commutation relations: For
all f, f ′ ∈D(T −α) ∩HC and g, g′ ∈D(T α) ∩HC,
[φF(T −αf), πF(T αg)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
[φF(T −αf), φF(T −αf ′)] = 0,
[πF(T αg), πF(T αg′)] = 0
on Fb,0(H ). For all t ∈R, f ∈D(T −α) ∩HC and g ∈D(T α) ∩HC, we
deﬁne
φα(t, f) := eitdΓb(T )φF(T −αf)e−itdΓb(T ),
πα(t, g) := eitdΓb(T )πF(T αg)e−itdΓb(T ).
It follows that, for all t ∈R, f, f ′ ∈D(T −α)∩HC and g, g′ ∈D(T α)∩HC,
[φα(t, f), πα(t, g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
[φα(t, f), φα(t, f ′)] = 0,
[πα(t, g), φα(t, g′)] = 0

on Fb,ﬁn(H ). Hence, for each t ∈R, {φα(t, f), πα(t, g) | f ∈D(T −α) ∩
HC, g ∈D(T α) ∩HC} obeys the Heisenberg CCR on Fb,ﬁn(H ).
Applying Theorem 5.31 to φα(t, f) = ΦS(t, T −αf), we obtain the fol-
lowing result:
Corollary 5.14. Let T be an injective and non-negative self-adjoint op-
erator on H
such that CT
⊂T C and f ∈D(T −α) ∩D(T 1−2α) ∩
D(T 2T −α) ∩D(T 2) ∩HC. Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2), the vector-
valued function:R ∋t 7→φα(t, f)Ψ are twice strongly diﬀerentiable and
obeys the diﬀerential equation

dt2 φα(t, f)Ψ + φα(t, T 2f)Ψ = 0.
(5.131)
In applications to quantum ﬁeld theory, diﬀerential equations (5.130)
and (5.131) with α = 1/2 give an abstract form of equations that relativistic
free Bose ﬁelds obey.
Remark 5.18. A mathematical theory of Heisenberg operators is given in
[Arai (2007)].

Vacuum Expectation Values
For a linear operator X on the boson Fock space Fb(H ) such that ΩH ∈
D(X), a complex number ⟨ΩH , XΩH ⟩is deﬁned. This number is called
the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of X.
Let us calculate VEV’s of products of Segal ﬁeld operators.

⟨ΩH , ΦS(f1) · · · ΦS(f2n−1)ΩH ⟩= 0,

where cj is a constant. But, by (5.28), ⟨ΩH , ΦS(f)ΩH ⟩= 0. Hence (5.132)
holds.
We prove (5.133) by induction in n. By the above calculation, (5.133)
with n = 1 holds. Suppose that (5.133) holds for some n ∈N. By the
above result,

we see that (5.133) with n replaced by n + 1 holds.
With regard to VEV’s of exponential operators of Segal ﬁeld operators,
we have the following theorem:
Theorem 5.33. For all f ∈H and z ∈C, ΩH ∈D(ezΦS(f)) and
D

where we have used P

5.18
Coherent Vectors
By Lemma 5.18(i), for all f ∈H , the Fock vacuum ΩH is an entire analytic
vector of A(f)∗. Hence the vector
exp f :=
∞
X
n=0
1
n!A(f)∗nΩH ∈Fb(H )
exists, which is called the coherent vector associated with f. We have
exp f = (exp A(f)∗)ΩH .
It is obvious that exp 0 = ΩH . If f ̸= 0, then exp f ̸= ΩH . A coherent
vector exp f is said to be non-trivial if f ̸= 0.
Remark 5.19. In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, a coherent vector
is also called a coherent state. A non-trivial coherent state is a quantum
state whose n-particle component is of the form A(f)∗nΩH /n! ̸= 0 with
f ∈H \ {0} for all n ∈Z+.
By the continuity of inner product, we have for all f, g ∈H
⟨exp f, exp g⟩= lim

n!m! ⟨A(f)∗nΩH , A(g)∗mΩH ⟩.
As a special case of (5.33), we have
⟨A(f)∗nΩH , A(g)∗mΩH ⟩= δmnn! ⟨f, g⟩n .
Hence
⟨exp f, exp g⟩= e⟨f,g⟩,
f, g ∈H .
In particular,
∥exp f∥= e∥f∥2/2.
 

272
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence a normalized coherent vector is given by
Υf := e−∥f∥2/2 exp f.
It is easy to see that Υf ∈D(Nb) and
⟨Υf, NbΥf⟩= ∥f∥2.
Also we have for all n ∈N and fj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , n)
⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , exp f⟩=

(5.135)
The following theorem describes basic properties of coherent vectors.
Theorem 5.34.
(i) If vectors f1, . . . , fn ∈H are linearly independent, then exp f1, . . . ,
exp fn are linearly independent.
(ii) If D is a dense subspace of H , then the subspace algebraically spanned
by coherent vectors exp f with f ∈D is dense in Fb(H ):
Fb(H ) = span {exp f|f ∈D}.
Proof. (i) Let Pn
j=1 αj exp fj = 0 with αj ∈C, j = 1, . . . , n. Then, for all
m ≥0, Pn
j=1 αjA(fj)∗mΩH = 0. In particular, Pn
j=1 αjA(fj)∗ΩH = 0,
which implies that Pn
j=1 αjfj = 0. Since {f1, . . . , fn} is linearly indepen-
dent, it follows that αj = 0, j = 1, . . . , n.
(ii) We need only to show that {exp f | f ∈D}⊥= {0}.
Let Ψ ∈
{exp f | f ∈D}⊥. Then, for all f ∈D and z ∈C, ⟨Ψ, exp(zf)⟩= 0. Hence

Therefore, for all n ≥0,

Ψ(0) = 0. Let n ≥1 next. Since f ∈D is arbitrary, we can take f =

j=1 zjfj with z1, . . . , zn ∈C and f1, . . . , fn ∈D arbitrary. Then we have

Diﬀerentiating the both sides of (5.136) in z1, . . . , zn one time respectively,
we obtain a1···1 = 0.
Hence

Ψ(n), A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH

Since
span {A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH |fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , n} is dense in ⊗n

lows that Ψ(n) = 0. Thus Ψ = 0.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
273
In view of Theorem 5.34(ii), Fb(H ) is written as exp(H ) and called
the exponential Hilbert space associated with H .
A relation between the Segal ﬁeld operators and coherent vectors is
given by the next theorem.
Theorem 5.35. For all z ∈C and f ∈H ,
ezΦS(f)ΩH = e∥f∥2z2/4 exp
 zf

(5.137)
Proof. Let
F(z) := e−∥f∥2z2/4ezΦS(f)ΩH .
Then we have
F(z) =

n=0
e−∥f∥2z2/4zn ΦS(f)n

Hence F(z) is strongly diﬀerentiable in z and

By Theorem 5.27 and (5.28), we have
A(f)F(z) = e−∥f∥2z2/4ezΦS(f) · e−zΦS(f)A(f)ezΦS(f)ΩH
= ∥f∥2z
√
2 F(z).
Hence
dF(z)

Therefore it follows that F(z) is inﬁnitely strongly diﬀerentiable in z and
F (n)(z) := dnF(z)

Putting F (n)(0) given above into the right hand side, we see that F(z) =

Spectra of A(f) and A(f)∗
It may be interesting to identify the spectra of A(f)#.
Theorem 5.36. For all f, g ∈H , exp f ∈D(A(g)) and
A(g) exp f = ⟨g, f⟩exp f.
(5.138)
Namely, ⟨g, f⟩∈σp(A(g)) and exp f is an eigenvector of A(g) belonging to
the eigenvalue ⟨g, f⟩.
In particular, if g ̸= 0, then
σ(A(g)) = σp(A(g)) = C.
(5.139)
Proof. The inﬁnite series P∞
n=0 A(g)A(f)∗nΩH /n! absolutely converges
(see (5.88)). Hence, using the closedness of A(g) and CCR with (5.28), we
have
A(g) exp f =
∞
X
n=0
A(g)A(f)∗nΩH
n!
=
∞
X
n=1
n ⟨g, f⟩A(f)∗n−1ΩH
n!
.
Hence (5.138) follows.
For each z ∈C, we have by (5.138)
A(g) exp(zg/∥g∥2) = z exp(zg/∥g∥2).
Hence z ∈σp(A(g)). Thus (5.139) holds.
The spectral property (5.139) of the annihilation operator A(g) is
interesting.
In contrast to Theorem 5.36, we have the following theorem on the
spectra of A(f)∗:
Theorem 5.37. For all f ∈H \ {0},
σp(A(f)∗) = ∅,
(5.140)
σ(A(f)∗) = σr(A(f)∗) = C.
(5.141)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈ker A(f)∗. Then A(f)∗Ψ = 0. Hence ∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 = 0.
Hence, by (5.37), ∥A(f)Ψ∥2 = 0 and ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2 = 0. Therefore Ψ = 0.
Thus 0 ̸∈σp(A(f)∗).
Next let z ∈C \ {0} and (A(f)∗−z)Ψ = 0. Then zΨ(0) = 0 and, for
all n ≥1, √nSn(f ⊗Ψ(n−1)) = zΨ(n). Hence Ψ(0) = 0. This implies that
zΨ(1) = 0. Hence Ψ(1) = 0. By induction in n, one sees that Ψ(n) = 0 for
all n ≥0, i.e., Ψ = 0. Therefore z ̸∈σp(A(f)∗) and A(f)∗−z is injective.
Thus (5.140) holds.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
275
Let z ∈C. Then, by the natural decomposition of Fb(H ) with respect
to A(f) −z∗, we have
Fb(H ) = ker(A(f) −z∗) ⊕Ran(A(f)∗−z).
By Theorem 5.36, dim ker(A(f) −z∗) ≥1.
Hence Ran(A(f)∗−z) ̸=
Fb(H ). Therefore z ∈σr(A(f)∗). Thus (5.141) follows.
5.20
The Boson Fock Space over a Direct Sum Hilbert
Space
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces. Then it is natural to consider the boson
Fock space Fb(H ⊕K ) over the direct sum Hilbert space
H ⊕K := {(f, g)|f ∈H , g ∈K }.
This boson Fock space is important not only pure-theoretically but also in
applications.
We denote the annihilation operator on Fb(H ) by AH (·).
The following theorem tells us the existence of a natural isomorphism
between Fb(H ⊕K ) and Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ):
Theorem 5.38. Assume that H and K are separable. Then there exists
a unique unitary operator U : Fb(H ⊕K ) →Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ) which
satisﬁes the following properties (i)–(iii):
(i)
UΩH ⊕K = ΩH ⊗ΩK
(5.142)
(ii)
UFb,ﬁn(H ⊕K ) = Fb,ﬁn(H )b⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ).
(5.143)
(iii) For all f ∈H and g ∈K ,
UAH ⊕K (f, g)#U −1 = AH (f)# ⊗I + I ⊗AK (g)#.
(5.144)
Proof. Throughout the proof, we set A(f, g) := AH ⊕K (f, g), (f, g) ∈
H ⊕K . Let {en}∞
n=1 and {ξn}∞
n=1 be CONS’s of H and K respectively.
Then {(en, 0), (0, ξn)|n ∈N} is a CONS of H ⊕K . By Proposition 5.1,

Hence, by the isomorphism theorem
(Theorem 2.4), there exists a unique unitary operator U : Fb(H ⊕K ) →

In particular, (5.142) holds.

on Fb,ﬁn(H ⊕K ). Hence Fb,ﬁn(H ⊕K ) is algebraically spanned by
vectors of the form Φ. Thus (5.143) holds.
To prove (iii), let
Ψ = AH (f1)∗· · · AH (fr)∗ΩH ⊗AK (g1)∗· · · AK (gq)∗ΩK .
(5.145)
Then
UA(f, g)∗U −1Ψ

= [AH (f)∗⊗I + I ⊗AK (g)∗]Ψ.
Hence (5.144) with #

∗holds on Fb,ﬁn(H )b⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ).
Since
Fb,ﬁn(X ) (X is a Hilbert space) is a core for AX (f)∗, it follows from
Proposition 3.2(ii) that Fb,ﬁn(H )b⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ) is a core for A(f)∗⊗I + I ⊗
A(g)∗. Hence operator equality (5.144) with # = ∗holds. This implies that
UA(f, g)U −1 = (AH (f)∗⊗I + I ⊗AK (g)∗)∗⊃AH (f) ⊗I + I ⊗AK (g).
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H )b⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ),
UA(f, g)U −1Ψ = (AH (f) ⊗I + I ⊗AK (g))Ψ.
Then, in the same way as in the case of UA(f, g)∗U −1, one can conclude
that (5.144) holds for A(f, g)# = A(f, g).
We call the isomorphism U in Theorem 5.38 the natural isomorphism
between Fb(H ⊕K ) and Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ) and write
Fb(H ⊕K ) ∼= Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ).
Example 5.5. We give an important example of the natural isomorphism
established above, which is useful in applications to quantum ﬁeld theory.
We consider the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)) over L2(Rd) (d ∈N). Let σ
and κ be constants satisfying 0 ≤σ < κ and A := {p ∈Rd | σ ≤|p| ≤κ}.
Then each element f ∈L2(Rd) has a unique orthogonal decomposition f =
f1 +f2 with f1 ∈L2(A) and f2 ∈L2(Ac) (explicitly f1 = χAf, f2 = χAcf).
Hence
L2(Rd) = L2(A) ⊕L2(Ac).
Therefore, by Theorem 5.38,
Fb(L2(Rd)) ∼= Fb(L2(A)) ⊗Fb(L2(Ac)).

Remark 5.20. As is easily seen, isomorphism (5.146) holds for any Borel
set A ∈Bd.
Theorem 5.38 is extended to the case where H ⊕K is replaced by the
direct sum of N Hilbert spaces with N ≥2 arbitrary:
Theorem 5.39. Let Hj, j = 1, . . . , N, (N ≥2) be separable Hilbert
spaces. Then there exists a unique unitary operator UN : Fb(⊕N

j=1Fb(Hj).
(5.147)
We next want to see how second quantization operators are transformed
by the unitary operator UN in Theorem 5.39.
Theorem 5.40. Let Hj, j = 1, . . . , N, (N ≥2) be separable Hilbert spaces
and Tj be a self-adjoint operator on Hj. Let UN be the unitary operator in

be proved in quite the same way). We set U = U2, H1 = H , H2 = K ,

It follows that, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))b⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)),
UdΓb(T ⊕S)U −1Ψ = [dΓb(T ) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(S)]Ψ.
By Theorem 5.1(v), Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓb(T ). Hence, by Theorem
3.8(iii), Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))b⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)) is a core for dΓb(T ) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(S).
We also have UFb,ﬁn(D(T ) ⊕D(S)) = Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))b⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)). Hence
(5.148) with N = 2 holds.
Example 5.6. In Example 5.5, let F : Rd →R∪{±∞} be a Borel measur-
able function a.e. ﬁnite. Then the multiplication operator by the function
F on L2(Rd) is self-adjoint. We denote the multiplication operator by the
same symbol. Let pA be the orthogonal projection onto L2(A). Then we
have pA = χA, the multiplication operator by the characteristic function of
A. It is easy to see that, for all f ∈D(F), pAf ∈D(F) and FpAf = pAFf.
Hence F is reduced by L2(A) and hence by L2(Ac). We have F = FA ⊕FAc
with FA = χAF and FAc = χAcF. Therefore, by Theorem 5.40,
dΓb(F) ∼= dΓb(FA) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(FAc)
under the natural isomorphism (5.146).
We next examine the transformation property of Γ-operators under the
natural isomorphism (5.147).
Theorem 5.41. Let Hj, j = 1, . . . , N, (N ≥2) be separable Hilbert spaces
and Tj be a self-adjoint or contraction operator on Hj.
Let UN be the

Proof. We give a proof only for the case N = 2. We set U = U2, H =
H1, K = H2, T = T1 and S = T2. Let Ψ be a vector of the form (5.145)
with fj ∈D(T ), gk ∈D(S). Then
UΓb(T ⊕S)U −1Ψ
= UΓb(T ⊕S)A(f1, 0)∗· · · A(fr, 0)∗A(0, g1)∗· · · A(0, gq)∗ΩH ⊕K

= A(T f1)∗· · · A(T fr)∗ΩH ⊗A(Sg1)∗· · · A(Sgq)∗ΩK
= [Γb(T ) ⊗Γb(S)]Ψ.
It follows that, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))b⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)),
UΓb(T ⊕S)U −1Ψ = [Γb(T ) ⊗Γb(S)]Ψ.
By Theorem 5.5(iv), Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for Γb(T ).
Hence, by
Proposition 3.2(ii) (in the case where T and S are contraction opera-
tors) or Theorem 3.8(iii) (in the case where T and S are self-adjoint),
Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))b⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)) is a core for Γb(T ) ⊗Γb(S).
We also have
UFb,ﬁn(D(T ) ⊕D(S)) = Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))b⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)). Hence (5.149) with
N = 2 holds.
Example 5.7. Let H be a separable Hilbert space and M be a closed
subspace of H . Then H = M ⊕M ⊥. Hence
Fb(H ) ∼= Fb(M ) ⊗Fb(M ⊥).
Let PM be the orthogonal projection onto M . Then we have PM = I ⊕0.
Hence
Γb(PM) ∼= Γb(I) ⊗Γb(0) = I ⊗Q,
where
Q
is
the

the

{αΩM ⊥| α ∈C} ⊂Fb(M ⊥).
Let f ∈M . Then A(f) = AM⊕M ⊥(f, 0) ∼= AM(f) ⊗I.

Representation of CCR over a Vector Space
As we have seen in Section 5.7, the boson creation and annihilation oper-
ators A(·)# on the boson Fock space Fb(H ) obey CCR, a set of charac-
teristic commutation relations, and the Fock vacuum ΩH is a cyclic vector
 

Boson Fock Spaces
281
for {A(f)∗|f ∈D} with D being a dense subspace of H (Proposition 5.7).
Moreover, various operators on the boson Fock space Fb(H ) can be made
from A(·)#’s. One of them is the Segal ﬁeld operator ΦS(f) (f ∈H ),
which is a simple linear combination of the creation operator A(f)∗and
the annihilation one A(f) and has interesting properties.
Noting these aspects and taking an algebraic point of view, one may
regard the boson Fock space Fb(H ) as a Hilbert space in which algebraic
objects obeying CCR are realized as A(f)#’s (f ∈H )
This point of view leads one to introduce a representation theoretical
concept of CCR.
Deﬁnition 5.3. Let F be a Hilbert space and D be a dense subspace in F.
Let V be a dense subspace of a Hilbert space H and C : V →L(F); V ∋
f 7→C(f) ∈L(F) such that, for all f ∈V , C(f) is densely deﬁned
and closed. The triplet (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) (or (F, D, {C(f), C(f)∗|f ∈
V })) is called a representation of the CCR over V if it has the following
properties:
(C.1) For all f ∈V , D ⊂D(C(f))∩D(C(f)∗) and C(f)D ⊂D, C(f)∗D ⊂
D.
(C.2) (anti-linearity in test vectors) For all f, g ∈V and α, β ∈C, C(αf +
βg) = α∗C(f) + β∗C(g) on D.
(C.3) (CCR) For all f, g ∈V ,
[C(f), C(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩H ,
(5.150)
[C(f), C(g)] = 0,
[C(f)∗, C(g)∗] = 0
(5.151)
on D.
The Hilbert space F is called the representation space of the present
representation of the CCR over V .
If {C(f), C(f)∗| f ∈V } is irreducible (resp. reducible), then the rep-
resentation (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) is said to be irreducible (resp.
re-
ducible).
Remark 5.21. Property (C.2) implies the linearity of C(f)∗in f: for all
f, g ∈V and α, β ∈C, C(αf + βg)∗= αC(f)∗+ βC(g)∗on D.
Remark 5.22. The subspace D is not necessarily unique.
Remark 5.23. By Remark 5.14, (5.150) with g = f implies that, for f ̸= 0,
at least one of C(f) and C(f)∗is unbounded. Hence, by Proposition 1.7,
both C(f) and C(f)∗are unbounded.
 

282
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Example 5.8. The triplet
ρF(V ) := (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {A(f)|f ∈V })
is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V (the irreducibility is due
to Theorem 5.14). This representation is called the Fock representation
of the CCR over V .
Example 5.9. Let L : V →C be a linear functional and
CL(f) := A(f) + L(f)∗.
Then (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CL(f)|f ∈V }) is an irreducible representation
of the CCR over V .
Example 5.10. Let W : H →H be an isometry (i.e., W is linear and
∥Wf∥= ∥f∥, f ∈H ) such that WV ⊂V and
CW (f) := A(Wf).
Then (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CW (f)|f ∈V }) is a representation of the CCR
over V . With regard to the irreducibility of this representation, see Problem
10.
Example 5.11. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over V and U : F →F ′ (F ′ is a Hilbert space) be a unitary operator.
Then (F ′, UD, {UC(f)U −1 | f ∈V }) is a representation of the CCR over
V .
As suggested by Examples 5.9 and 5.10, there are inﬁnitely many rep-
resentations of the CCR over V , which are not necessarily of the type as
described in Example 5.11. Thus we are led to a concept to classify repre-
sentations of CCR:
Deﬁnition 5.4. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) and (F ′, D′, {C′(f)|f ∈V })
be two representations of the CCR over V . They are said to be equivalent
if there exists a unitary operator U : F →F ′ such that, for all f ∈V ,
C′(f) = UC(f)U −1 (operator equality). In that case, we often say simply
that {C(f)|f ∈V } is equivalent to {C′(f)|f ∈V }.
Remark 5.24. The operator equality C′(f) = UC(f)U −1 implies that
C′(f)∗= UC(f)∗U −1.
Remark 5.25. Suppose that ρ := (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) is equivalent to
ρ′ := (F ′, D′, {C′(f)|f ∈V }). Then, by Proposition 5.8, ρ is reducible
 

Boson Fock Spaces
283
(resp. irreducible) if and only if ρ′ is reducible (resp. irreducible). Hence,
if ρ is reducible and ρ′ is irreducible, then ρ is inequivalent to ρ′. But this
type of inequivalence is a trivial inequivalence. Non-trivial inequivalences
may occur among irreducible representations.
Example 5.12. Let us consider the representation (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ),
{CW (f)|f ∈V }) in Example 5.10.
Suppose that W is unitary.
Then,
UW := Γb(W) is a unitary operator on Fb(H ) and, by Theorem 5.30,
UW A(f)U −1
W = CW (f),
f ∈V .
Hence (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CW (f)|f ∈V }) is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation ρF(V ).
Deﬁnition 5.5. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over V . Then a unit vector Ω∈∩∞
n=1 ∩fj∈V ,j=1,...,n D(C(f1)# · · · C(fn)#)
satisfying C(f)Ω= 0, ∀f ∈V (if it exists) is called a vacuum for the
representation. We write this representation as {F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω}
In the present case, one can deﬁne a subspace
Fﬁn := span {Ω, C(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω|n ∈N, fj ∈V , j = 1, . . . , n},
which is called the subspace generated from the vacuum Ω.
In Deﬁnition 5.5, the condition that Fﬁn = F (the cyclicity of Ωfor
{C(f)∗|f ∈V }) is not required. But, if Ωis a cyclic vector for {C(f)∗|f ∈
V }, then we call (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω}) a cyclic representation of
the CCR over V .
Example 5.13. The Fock representation ρF(V ) (Example 5.8) is a cyclic
representation with the Fock vacuum ΩH .
Lemma 5.23. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over V having a vacuum Ω.
Then, for all f, g ∈V , CCR (5.150) and
(5.151) hold on Fﬁn.
Proof. Let Φ ∈D and Ψ ∈Fﬁn. Then
⟨Φ, [C(f), C(g)∗]Ψ⟩= ⟨[C(g), C(f)∗]Φ, Ψ⟩= ⟨⟨g, f⟩Φ, Ψ⟩
= ⟨Φ, ⟨f, g⟩Ψ⟩.
Since D is dense in F, it follows that [C(f), C(g)∗]Ψ = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ. Similarly
one can prove (5.151) on Fﬁn.
 

284
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR over V
having a vacuum Ω. Then one can deﬁne a linear operator Cﬁn(f) (f ∈V )
on the Hilbert space Fﬁn as follows:
D(Cﬁn(f)) := Fﬁn,
Cﬁn(f)Ψ := C(f)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fﬁn.
Then it easy to see that Cﬁn(f) is densely deﬁned and Fﬁn ⊂D(Cﬁn(f)∗)
with Cﬁn(f)∗Ψ = C(f)∗Ψ, Ψ ∈Fﬁn. Hence Cﬁn(f) is closable. We denote
its closure by CΩ(f).
Lemma 5.23 shows that
πΩ(V ) := {Fﬁn, Fﬁn, {CΩ(f)|f ∈V }, Ω}
is a cyclic representation of the CCR over V .
Theorem 5.42. The representation πΩ(V ) is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation ρF(V ).
Proof. We deﬁne a mapping U : Fﬁn →Fb,ﬁn(V ) by
UΩ:= ΩH ,
UC(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω:= A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
(fj ∈V , j = 1, · · · , n, n ∈N). For any element Ψ in Fﬁn, UΨ is deﬁned
by linear extension (show that this is well-deﬁned). It is easy to see that
U is isometry and Ran(U) = Fb,ﬁn(V ). Since Fﬁn is dense in Fﬁn, by the
extension theorem, U is extended uniquely to a unitary operator from Fﬁn
to Fb(H ). We denote the extension of U by the same symbol U.
Let f ∈V . Then, by CCR and the fact that C(f)Ω= 0, we have
CΩ(f)C(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω=
n
X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩C(f1)∗· · ·
jth
C(fj)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω.
Hence
UCΩ(f)C(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω=
n
X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩A(f1)∗· · ·
jth
A(fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= A(f)A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(V ), UCΩ(f)U −1Ψ = A(f)Ψ.
Recall that
Fb,ﬁn(V ) is a core for A(f). Hence it follows from a limiting argument that
A(f) ⊂UCΩ(f)U −1. Exchanging the role of A(f) and CΩ(f), we see that
CΩ(f) ⊂U −1A(f)U, i.e., UCΩ(f)U −1 ⊂A(f). Hence we obtain operator
equality UCΩ(f)U −1 = A(f). This implies that UCΩ(f)∗U −1 = A(f)∗.
 

Boson Fock Spaces

Corollary 5.15. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω) be a cyclic representation of
the CCR over V . Suppose that, for all f ∈V , Fﬁn is core for C(f). Then
{F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω} is equivalent to the Fock representation ρF(V ).
Proof. By the cyclicity of Ω, we have Fﬁn = F. Hence the operator U
in the proof of Theorem 5.42 is a unitary operator from F to Fb(H ) By
the present assumption, CΩ(f) = C(f), f ∈V . Thus, by Theorem 5.42,
UC(f)#U −1 = A(f)#.
5.22
Second Quantization Operators Associated with a
Representation of CCR
Deﬁnition 5.6. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over V and T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Let
VT := {f ∈V ∩D(T ) ∩D(T ∗) | T f, T ∗f ∈V }.
A densely deﬁned linear operator H(T ) on F is called a second quanti-
zation operator (or simply second quantization) of T associated with
the representation(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) if there exists a dense subspace
D0 ⊂D such that D0 ⊂∩f∈VT (D([H(T ), C(f)]) ∩D([H(T ), C(f)∗])) and,
for all f ∈VT and Ψ ∈D0,
[H(T ), C(f)]Ψ = −C(T ∗f)Ψ,
(5.152)
[H(T ), C(f)∗]Ψ = C(T f)∗Ψ.
(5.153)
Remark 5.26. It is obvious that, if H(T ) is a second quantization oper-
ator of T associated with the representation(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }), then
so is H(T ) + X for all densely deﬁned linear operators X on F such
that D0 ⊂∩f∈VT {D([X, C(f)]) ∩D([X, C(f)∗])} and, for all f ∈V
and Ψ ∈D0, [X, C(f)#]Ψ = 0.
In particular, for all constants c,
H(T ) + c is a second quantization operator of T associated with the
representation(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }). The operator H(T ), up to constant
additions, is not necessarily unique (i.e., there may be an operator X which
satisﬁes the above property and is not a constant operator).
Example 5.14. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then,
by Proposition 5.10, dΓb(T ) is a second quantization operator of T as-
sociated with the Fock representation ρF(H ) (the case V

We formulate a suﬃcient condition for the existence of a second
quantization operator associated with a representation of CCR. Let
(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR over V and T be a
densely deﬁned closable operator.
Proposition 5.17. Suppose that, for all f ∈VT , D is a core for C(f)
and C(f)∗. Assume that there exist a CONS {en}∞
n=1 of H and a dense
subspace D0 ⊂D satisfying the following conditions:
(H.1) For all n ∈N, en ∈V ∩D(T ∗) and T ∗en ∈V .
(H.2) For all f ∈VT , C(f)D0 ⊂D0 and C(f)∗D0 ⊂D0.
(H.3) For all f ∈VT and Φ ∈D, Ψ ∈D0,

Proof. Let f ∈VT and Φ ∈D, Ψ ∈D0.
Then, by (H.2) and (H.4),
C(f)Ψ ∈D0 ⊂D(H). Hence
⟨Φ, HC(f)Ψ⟩−⟨C(f)∗Φ, HΨ⟩=

By (H.3), the right hand side is equal to −⟨Φ, C(T ∗f)Ψ⟩. Hence we obtain
⟨C(f)∗Φ, HΨ⟩= ⟨Φ, HC(f)Ψ⟩+ ⟨Φ, C(T ∗f)Ψ⟩.
Since D is a core for C(f)∗, it follows that HΨ ∈D(C(f)∗∗) = D(C(f))
and (5.152) with H(T ) = H holds. Similarly one can prove (5.153) with
H(T ) = H.

Example 5.15. Let us ﬁnd a second quantization of the representation
(Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CL(f)|f ∈V }) in Example 5.9. For simplicity, we
consider the case where
L(f) = ⟨g, f⟩,
f ∈V
for some g ∈D(T ) ∩D(T ∗). We take Fb,ﬁn(VT ) as D0 (D = Fb,ﬁn(V )).
It is obvious that, for all f ∈VT , CL(f)#Fb,ﬁn(VT ) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(VT ).
Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H such that en ∈V ∩D(T ∗) and T ∗en ∈V .
Let f ∈VT and Φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(V ), Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(VT ). Then

Thus, in the present case
H(T, g) := dΓb(T ) + A(T g)∗+ A(T ∗g) + ⟨g, T g⟩
is a second quantization of T associated with {CL(f) | f ∈V }.
Note that, if T is self-adjoint, then H(T, g) is a symmetric operator.
If H(T, g) is self-adjoint or essentially self-adjoint, then H(T, g) or its clo-
sure is the Hamiltonian of an abstract van Hove-Miyatake model in
quantum ﬁeld theory. We discuss this model in detail in Chapter 13.
Example 5.16. A second quantization of T associated with the represen-
tation (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CW (f)|f ∈V }) in Example 5.10 is given by
dΓb(WT W −1) (Problem 11).
5.23
Representation of Heisenberg CCR
The set of operators {φF(f), πF(f) |, f ∈HC} introduced in Section 5.12
suggests a general concept of representations of the Heisenberg CCR over
a real inner product space.
Deﬁnition 5.7. Let K be a real Hilbert space and W be a dense subspace
of K . Let F be a Hilbert space and D be a dense subspace of F. Sup-
pose that, for each f ∈W , there exist symmetric operators φ(f) and π(f)
satisfying the following conditions:
(i) D ⊂∩f∈W D(φ(f)) ∩D(π(f)) and φ(f)D ⊂D, π(f)D ⊂D, f ∈W .
(ii) For all f, g ∈W and a, b ∈R, φ(af + bg) = aφ(f) + bφ(g) and π(af +
bg) = aπ(f) + bπ(g) on D.
(iii) For all f, g ∈W ,
[φ(f), π(g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
[φ(f), φ(g)] = 0,
[π(f), π(g)] = 0
on D.
Then (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is called a representation of the
Heisenberg CCR over W .
 

Boson Fock Spaces
289
Two representations (F, D,
{φ(f), π(f) | f
∈
W }) and (F ′, D′,
{φ′(f), π′(f) | f ∈W }) of the Heisenberg CCR over W are said to be
equivalent if there exists a unitary operator U : F →F ′ such that,
for all f ∈W , Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f) and Uπ(f)U −1 = π′(f).
The representation (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is said to be irre-
ducible (resp.
reducible) if {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W } is irreducible (resp.
reducible).
Remark 5.27. In this deﬁnition, the self-adjointness of φ(f) and π(f) are
not required and the subspace D is not necessarily unique.
Remark 5.28. By Remark 5.14 and Deﬁnition 5.7(iii), if f ̸= 0, then at
least one of φ(f) and π(f) is unbounded.
Remark 5.29. Remark 5.25 applies also to representations of Heisenberg
CCR.
Example 5.17. Let φF(f) and πF(f) (f ∈HC) be deﬁned by (5.107) and
W be any dense subspace of H such that CW ⊂W . Then, by Theorem
5.26(iv), (Fb(H ), Fb,0(H ), {φF(f), πF(f) | f ∈WC}) is an irreducible rep-
resentation of the Heisenberg CCR over WC. This representation is called
the Fock representation of the Heisenberg CCR over WC.
The following proposition shows that a representation of the CCR over
a complex inner product space with an additional condition yields a repre-
sentation of the Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space.
Proposition 5.18. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and V be a dense
subspace of H . Let J be a conjugation on H such that JV ⊂V . Suppose
that there exists a representation (F, D, {C(f) | f ∈V }) of the CCR over
V and let
φ(f) :=
1
√
2(C(f)∗+ C(f)),
π(f) :=
i
√
2(C(f)∗−C(f)).
Then (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈VJ}) is a representation of the Heisenberg
CCR over VJ.
Proof. An easy exercise.
We call (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈VJ}) the representation of the
Heisenberg CCR induced by (F, D, {C(f) | f ∈V }) with conjugation
J.
 

290
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Example 5.18. The Fock representation (Fb(H ), Fb,0(H ), {φF(f),
πF(f)
| f ∈WC}) in Example 5.17 is the representation of the Heisenberg
CCR induced by (Fb(H ), Fb,0(H ), {A(f) | f ∈W }) with conjugation C.
To consider the converse of Proposition 5.18, we recall a basic concept
in Hilbert space theory. Let K be a real Hilbert space with inner product
⟨, ⟩K . Then the product space K × K := {(f, g) | f, g ∈K } becomes a
complex vector space with the following operation of addition and scalar
multiplication: for all (f, g), (f ′, g′) ∈K ×K and α = a+ib ∈C (a, b ∈R),
(f, g) + (f ′, g′) := (f + g, f ′ + g′),
α(f, g) := (af −bg, ag + bf).
This complex vector space is called the complexiﬁcation of K and de-
noted by KC.
Note that ψ := (f, g) = (f, 0) + i(g, 0) (f, g ∈K ). Hence, identifying
(f, 0) with f, we have ψ = f + ig. The vector f (resp. g) is called the real
(resp. imaginary) part of ψ and written as f = Re ψ (resp. g = Im ψ).
A natural inner product is introduced in KC by
⟨f + ig, f ′ + ig′⟩KC := ⟨f, f ′⟩K + ⟨g, g′⟩K −i ⟨g, f ′⟩K + i ⟨f, g′⟩K
(f, f ′, g, g′ ∈K ). Then the inner product space (KC, ⟨, ⟩KC) becomes a
complex Hilbert space. This Hilbert space is called the complexiﬁcation
of the real Hilbert space K and denoted by the same symbol KC for sim-
plicity. Henceforth the subscript KC in ⟨, ⟩KC is omitted, provided that
there would be no danger of confusion.
We deﬁne a mapping CK : KC →KC by
CK (f + ig) := f −ig,
f, g ∈K .
Then it is easy to see that CK is a conjugation. This conjugation is called
the complex conjugation on KC. It immediately follows that
K = (KC)CK .
Example 5.19. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and C be a conjugation
on H . Then (HC)C ∼= H .
Proposition 5.19. Let (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a representation
of the Heisenberg CCR over W as in Deﬁnition 5.7 and WC be the com-
plexiﬁcation of W .
 

Boson Fock Spaces
291
(i) Let
Φ(f) := φ(Re f) + π(Im f),
f ∈WC.
(5.154)
Then Φ(f) is symmetric and, for all f, g ∈WC,
[Φ(f), Φ(g)] = iIm ⟨f, g⟩
(5.155)
on D.
(ii) Let
C(f) :=
1
√
2(Φ(f) + iΦ(if)),
f ∈WC.
Then C(f) is closable and (F, D, {C(f) | f ∈WC}) is a representation
of the CCR over WC.
Proof. An easy exercise.
Propositions 5.18 and 5.19 show that considering a representation of the
Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space W is essentially equivalent
to considering a representation of the CCR over WC.
Remark 5.30. Noting commutation relation (5.155), one can deﬁne a gen-
eralized concept of representation of Heisenberg CCR in the following al-
ternative manner. Let X be a complex Hilbert space and Y be a dense
subspace of X .
Let ω be a mapping from Y × Y to R satisfying the
following (i)–(iii):
(i) (real bi-linearity) For all f, g, h ∈Y and a, b ∈R,
ω(af + bg, h) = a ω(f, h) + b ω(g, h),
ω(h, af + bg) = a ω(h, f) + b ω(h, g).
(ii) (anti-symmetry) For all f, g ∈Y , ω(f, g) = −ω(g, f).
(iii) (non-degeneracy) {f ∈Y |ω(f, g) = 0, g ∈Y } = {0}.
The mapping ω is called a real symplectic form on Y .
Suppose that a set {Φ(f)|f ∈Y } of symmetric (not necessarily self-
adjoint) operators on a Hilbert space F is given and D be a dense sub-
space of F left invariant by each Φ(f), f ∈Y .
Then the quadruple
(F, D, {Φ(f)|f ∈Y }, ω) is called a representation of the generalized
Heisenberg CCR over (Y , ω) if, for all f, g ∈Y and a, b ∈R,
Φ(af + bg) = a Φ(f) + b Φ(g)
on D and
[Φ(f), Φ(g)]Ψ = iω(f, g)Ψ.
(5.156)

(i) ω(f, g) = Im ⟨f, g⟩X , f, g ∈Y .
(ii) ω(f, g) = Im ⟨f, T g⟩X , f, g ∈Y , where T ∈B(X ) is any injective
self-adjoint operator.
5.24
Weyl Representations of CCR
5.24.1
Deﬁnition and remarks
Representations of CCR and Heisenberg CCR considered so far are un-
bounded in the sense that operators realizing them are unbounded (see
Remark 5.23). But, with regard to Heisenberg CCR, there is a scheme
to translate them into commutation relations of unitary operators, which
are heuristically (informally) equivalent, but, in reality, not necessarily
equivalent.11
Deﬁnition 5.8. Let K be a real Hilbert space, W be a dense subspace
of K and F be a complex Hilbert space.
Suppose that, for each f ∈
W , two self-adjoint operators φ(f) and π(f) on F are deﬁned. The pair
(F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is called a Weyl representation of the CCR
over W on F if the following (i) and (ii) hold:
(i) For all f, g ∈W and t ∈R,
φ(tf) = tφ(f),
π(tf) = tπ(f),
φ(f) + φ(g) ⊂φ(f + g),
π(f) + π(g) ⊂π(f + g).
(ii) (Weyl relations over W ) For all f, g ∈W ,
eiφ(f)eiπ(g) = e−i⟨f,g⟩eiπ(g)eiφ(f),
(5.157)
eiφ(f)eiφ(g) = eiφ(g)eiφ(f),
(5.158)
eiπ(f)eiπ(g) = eiπ(g)eiπ(f).
(5.159)
The Weyl representation (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is said to be irre-
ducible (resp. reducible) if {eiφ(f), eiπ(f) | f ∈W } is irreducible (resp.
reducible).
Two Weyl representations (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) and (F ′, {φ′(f),
π′(f) | f ∈W }) are said to be equivalent if there exists a unitary operator
U : F →F ′ such that, for all f ∈W , Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f) and Uπ(f)U −1 =
π′(f).
11For a heuristic argument, see, e.g., [Putnam (1967), §4.2] where the case of the Heisen-
berg CCR with one degree of freedom is discussed.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
293
If dim W = ∞, then (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is said to be a Weyl
representation with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
Remark 5.31. Relations (5.158) and (5.159) imply that {φ(f) | f ∈W }
(resp. {π(f) | f ∈W }) is a family of strongly commuting self-adjoint oper-
ators on F. Hence, for all f, g, φ(f) + φ(g) is essentially self-adjoint and
φ(f + g) = φ(f) + φ(g). Similarly we have π(f + g) = π(f) + π(g). It
follows that
eiφ(f+g) = eiφ(f)eiφ(g),
eiπ(f+g) = eiπ(f)eiπ(g).
Remark 5.32. Remark 5.25 applies also to Weyl representations of CCR.
Remark 5.33. Deﬁnition 5.8 includes, as a special case, the concept of
Weyl representation of the CCR with N degrees of freedom (N ∈N), which
is deﬁned as follows. Let Qn and Pn (n = 1, . . . , N) be self-adjoint operators
on a Hilbert space F. Then (F, {Qn, Pn | n = 1, . . . , N}) is called a Weyl
representation of the CCR with N degrees of freedom if it satisﬁes the
following relations (the Weyl relations with N degrees of freedom): for all
s, t ∈R and n, m = 1, . . . , N,
eitQneisPm = e−iδnmtseisPmeitQn,
(5.160)
eitQneisQm = eisQmeitQn,
eitPneisPm = eitPmeisPn.
(5.161)
Indeed, if one takes an ONS {en}N
n=1 with en ∈W in Deﬁnition 5.8 and
deﬁnes Qn := φ(en) and Pn := π(en) (n ∈N), then these operators obey
(5.160) and (5.161).
It is shown that a Weyl representation (F, {Qn, Pn | n = 1, . . . , N}) is a
representation of the Heisenberg CCR with N degrees of freedom (Problem
6 in Chapter 3). For proof of this fact, see Proposition 5.20 and Theorem
5.45 below. But the converse is not true. Namely a representation of the
Heisenerg CCR with ﬁnite degrees of freedom is not necessarily a Weyl
representation. We have seen this in Problem 13 in Chapter 1.
Remark 5.34. As is well known, any irreducible Weyl representation
(F, {Qn, Pn|n = 1, . . . , N}) with N degrees of freedom on a separable
Hilbert space F is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger representation
π(N)
S
:= (L2(RN), C∞
0 (RN), {qn, pn|n = 1, . . . , N})
of the Heisenberg CCR with N degrees of freedom, where qn is the multipli-
cation operator by the nth coordinate function xn (x = (x1, . . . , xN) ∈RN)
and pn := −iDxn with Dxn being the generalized partial diﬀerential oper-
ator in the variable xn acting in L2(RN). Namely there exists a unitary
 

294
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
operator U : F →L2(RN) such that, for all n = 1, . . . , N, UQnU −1 = qn
and UPnU −1 = pn. This is the celebrated von Neumann uniqueness
theorem on representation of CCR [von Neumann (1931)] (cf. also, e.g.,
[Putnam (1967), §4.3, §4.11] and [Arai (2006b), Chapter 3]).
It should
be noted, however, that, as for non-Weyl representations of Heisenberg
CCR, the uniquness theorem does not hold even if the degrees of freedom
are ﬁnite. We want to emphasize this aspect, since there are textbooks
and literatures with the misunderstanding that, for each N ∈N, every
irreducible representation of the Heisenberg CCR with N degrees of free-
dom is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger representation π(N)
S
. Indeed, there is
an example (H , D, {q, p}) of irreducible representations of the Heisenberg
CCR with one degree of freedom in which both q and p are unbounded
self-adjoint operators and which is inequivalent to π(1)
S
[Fuglede (1967)].
Physically interesting examples of irreducible representations of the CCR
with two degrees of freedom inequivalent to the Schr¨odinger representation
π(2)
S
appear in gauge quantum mechanics in connection with the so-called
Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect (see [Arai (1998)] and references therein).
Remark 5.35. In contrast to the case of Weyl representations with ﬁnite
degrees of freedom, for Weyl representations with inﬁnite degrees of free-
dom, a uniqueness theorem similar to the von Neumann uniqueness theorem
mentioned above does not hold any more. We shall see this in Section 5.25
below.
5.24.2
A class of irreducible Weyl representations on the
abstract boson Fock space
Theorem 5.43. Let C be a conjugation on a Hilbert space H and D be
a dense subspace in HC.
Then (Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f) | f ∈D} is an
irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR over D.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.26(iii).
There is a general class of irreducible Weyl representations of CCR
which contains (Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f) | f ∈D} as shown below.
Let T be an injective self-adjoint operator on H reduced by HC and
D be a dense subspace in HC such that D ⊂D(T ) ∩D(T −1). Then one
can deﬁne
φT (f) := φF(T −1f),
πT (f) := πF(T f),
f ∈D.
(5.162)
Note that, by the reducibility of T by HC, T −1f, T f ∈HC for all f ∈D.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
295
Theorem 5.44. Suppose that T −1D and T D are dense in HC.
Then
(Fb(H ), {φT (f), πT (f)|f ∈D}) is an irreducible Weyl representation of
the CCR over D.
Proof. Since

T −1f, T g

= ⟨f, g⟩for all f, g ∈D, it follows from the Weyl
relations of {eiφF(f), eiπF(f)|f ∈D} that {eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈D} obeys the
Weyl relations over D. To prove the irreducibility of {eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈
D}, let B ∈{eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈D}′. Then BeiφF(f) = eiφF(f)B · · · (∗) and
BeiπF(g) = eiπF(g)B for all f ∈T −1D and g ∈T D. Since T −1D is dense in
HC, for any f ∈HC, there exists a sequence {fn}∞
n=1 in T −1D such that
fn →f (n →∞). By (∗), for all Ψ ∈Fb(H ),
BeiφF(fn)Ψ = eiφF(fn)BΨ.
By the strong continuity of ΦS(h) in h ∈H (see Theorem 5.25(iii)), taking
the limit n →∞in the above equation yields BeiφF(f)Ψ = eiφF(f)BΨ, i.e.,
BeiφF(f) = eiφF(f)B. Similarly we have BeiπF(f) = eiπF(f)B for all f ∈HC.
Hence B ∈{eiφF(f), eiπF(f)|f ∈HC}′. Therefore, by Theorem 5.26(iii),
B = cI for some c ∈C. Thus {eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈D} is irreducible.
Remark 5.36. A detailed study on the representation ρT := {eiφT (f),
eiπT (f) |f ∈D} has been given in [Arai (2016)]. In this article, a nec-
essary and suﬃcient condition for two representations ρT1 and ρT2 to be
equivalent is formulated. In particular, it is shown that, if the closure of
T −1
2
T1−T2T −1
1
is not Hilbert-Schmidt with some technical conditions, then
they are inequivalent. This is an interesting structure.
5.24.3
General properties
We now turn to general aspects of Weyl representations of CCR. We ﬁrst
prove two lemmas, which are important themselves.
Lemma 5.24. Let H be a self-adjoint operator and T be a closed operator
on a Hilbert space satisfying operator equality
eitHT e−itH = T + ct,
t ∈R,
(5.163)
where c ∈C is a constant. Then:
(i) D(H) ∩D(HT ) ⊂D(T H) and
[T, H]Ψ = icΨ,
Ψ ∈D(H) ∩D(HT )
(5.164)
(ii) (spectrum of T ) If T is self-adjoint and c ̸= 0, then σ(T ) = R.
 

296
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(H) ∩D(HT ). Then we have for all t ∈R
T e−itHΨ = e−itHT Ψ + cte−itHΨ.
Since Ψ is in D(H)∩D(HT ), the right hand side is strongly diﬀerentiable in
t and its strong derivative is −ie−itHHT Ψ+ce−itHΨ−icte−itHHΨ. Hence
the left hand side is strongly diﬀerentiable in t. This fact and the closedness
of T imply that −ie−itHHΨ ∈D(T ) and d(T e−itHΨ)/dt = −iT e−itHHΨ.
Therefore, taking t = 0, we see that Ψ ∈D(T H) and (5.164) holds.
(ii) Let T be self-adjoint.
Then it is easy to see that c ∈R \ {0}.
By the unitary invariance of the spectrum of a linear operator, we have
σ(T ) = σ(T + ct) = {λ + ct|λ ∈σ(T )} for all t ∈R. Since σ(T ) ̸= ∅, there
is a λ0 ∈σ(T ). Hence, for all t ∈R, λ0 + ct ∈σ(T ). Therefore σ(T ) = R.
Remark 5.37. If H represents a quantum Hamiltonian, then a (closed)
symmetric operator T satisfying (5.163) with c = 1 is called a strong
time operator with respect to H [Arai (2005)].12
Remark 5.38. Concerning the spectrum of H, one has the following fact:
if H is self-adjoint and T is a symmetric operator satisfying (5.163) with
c ̸= 0, then H is absolutely continuous.13 For a proof of this fact, see [Arai
(2005), Theorem 6.7] and [Schm¨udgen (1983), Corollary 2].
Lemma 5.25. Let Q and P be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space
obeying the Weyl relation
eisQeitP = e−icsteitP eisQ,
s, t ∈R,
where c ∈R \ {0} is a constant. Then
eitP Qe−itP = Q + ct,
t ∈R.
In particular,
[Q, P] = ic on D(QP) ∩D(PQ).
Moreover
σ(P) = σ(Q) = R.
(5.165)
Proof. The Weyl relation is equivalent to
eitP eisQe−itP = eicsteisQ,
s, t ∈R.

By the unitary convariance of functional calculus, we have
eis(eitP Qe−itP ) = eis(Q+ct).
Hence eitP Qe−itP = Q + ct, t ∈R. Hence the commutation relation of
Q and P follows from an application of Lemma 5.24(i). An application of
Lemma 5.24(ii) yields that σ(Q) = R. Exchanging the role of Q and P,
one has σ(P) = R.
Remark 5.39. Suppose that the assumption of Lemma 5.25 holds. Then,
by symmetry between Q and P, we have eitQPe−itQ = P −ct for all
t ∈R. Hence, by Remark 5.38, Q and P are absolutely continuous with
σ(Q) = σac(Q) = R and σ(P) = σac(P) = R. Thus we see that Weyl
relations are so strong that they determine the spectral properties of the
operators involved.
In view of Lemma 5.25, relation (5.163) is called the weak Weyl rela-
tion for (H, T ).
Lemma 5.25 immediately yields the following proposition:
Proposition 5.20. Let (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a Weyl representation
of the CCR over W on a Hilbert space F. Then {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W } obeys
the Heisenberg CCR over W in the following sense:
[φ(f), π(g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩on D([φ(f), π(g)]),
(5.166)
[φ(f), φ(g)] = 0 on D([φ(f), φ(g)]),
(5.167)
[π(f), π(g)] = 0 on D([π(f), π(g)]).
(5.168)
Remark 5.40. The converse of Proposition 5.20 does not hold. Namely a
representation of the Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space does
not necessarily yield a Weyl representation of the CCR over the same inner
product space.
Let (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a Weyl representation of the CCR
over W on a Hilbert space F.
Then the closure of the operator Φ(f)
(f ∈WC) deﬁned by (5.154) corresponds to the Segal ﬁeld operator in the
Fock representation {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈WC}. It is natural to ask if Φ(f) is
essentially self-adjoint. The answer to this question is aﬃrmative. But, to
prove this, we still need a lemma.
Lemma 5.26. Let A and B be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space X
satisfying the Weyl relation
eitAeisB = e−itsceisBeitA,
s, t ∈R,
(5.169)
where c ∈R \ {0} is a constant. Then:

(i) There is a dense subspace D0 ⊂D(A) ∩D(B) left invariant by
eitA, eitB, A and B for all t ∈R and
[A, B] = ic
on D0.
(ii) The sum A + B is essentially self-adjoint and, for all t ∈R,
eit(A+B) = eit2c/2eitAeitB.
(5.170)
Proof. (i) For each ψ ∈X and f ∈C∞
0 (R2), we deﬁne a vector ψf ∈X
by
ψf :=
Z
R
f(x, y)eixAeiyBψ dx dy,
where the integral on the right hand side is taken in the strong Riemann
integral.
Let ρ ∈C∞
0 (R) be such that, ρ ≥0 and
R
R ρ(x)dx = 1 and
fn(x, y) := n2ρ(nx)ρ(ny), x, y ∈R, n ∈N. Then, by change of variable, we
have
ψn −ψ =
Z
R2 ρ(x)ρ(y)(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψdxdy.
Hence
∥ψn −ψ∥≤
Z
R2 ρ(x)ρ(y)∥(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψ∥dxdy.
It
is
easy
to
see
that
limn→∞∥(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψ∥
=
0
and
ρ(x)ρ(y)∥(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψ∥≤2ρ(x)ρ(y)∥ψ∥, which is integrable with
respect to dxdy. Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
the right hand side of the above inequality converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence,
for all ψ ∈X , limn→∞ψfn = ψ. Therefore the subspace
D0 := span {ψf | f ∈C∞
0 (R2), ψ ∈X }
is dense in X .
Let t ∈R.
Then it is easy to see that eitAψf = ψft ∈D0, where
ft(x, y) := f(x −t, y) (ft ∈C∞
0 (R2)). Hence eitAD0 ⊂D0 and
lim
t→0
eitAψf −ψf
t
= lim
t→0 ψft−f = −ψ∂xf.
Hence ψf ∈D(A) and Aψf = iψ∂xf ∈D0. Therefore AD0 ⊂D0.
Using (5.169), we see that
eitBψf = ψg ∈D0
with g(x, y) := eixtcf(x, y −t) (note that g ∈C∞
0 (R2)).
Hence, for all
t ∈R, eitBD0 ⊂D0. In the same way as in the case of A, one can show
that ψf ∈D(B) and Bψf = iψ∂yf + ψcxf ∈D0. Hence BD0 ⊂D0.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
299
The Heisenberg commutation relation [A, B] = ic on D0 follows from
Lemma 5.25.
(ii) For each t ∈R, we deﬁne a unitary operator U(t) on X by
U(t) := eict2/2eitAeitB.
Using (5.169) one can show that {U(t)}t∈R is a strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group. Hence, by Stones’s theorem, there exists a unique
self-adjoint operator S on X such that U(t) = eitS. Hence
eitS = eict2/2eitAeitB.
It follows from this equation that D(A) ∩D(B) ⊂D(S) and A + B ⊂S.14
By (i) and the above formula, eitSD0 ⊂D0 and D0 ⊂D(A)∩D(B) ⊂D(S)
and S = A + B on D0. Hence, by Theorem 1.23, A + B is essentially self-
adjoint on D0 and S = A + B, implying (5.170).
Remark 5.41. Lemma 5.26 can be extended to the case of N self-adjoint
operators Aj, j = 1, . . . , N (N ≥2) obeying generalized Weyl relations
eitAjeisAk = e−itsajkeisAkeitAj (t, s ∈R, j, k = 1, . . . , N), where ajk’s are
real constants with ajk = −akj, j, k = 1, . . . , N. In this case, one can show
that PN
j=1 Aj is essentially self-adjoint [Arai (2013), Theorem A.6].
Theorem 5.45. Let (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a Weyl representation of
the CCR over W on a Hilbert space F. Then:
(i) For each n ∈N and Fn := (f1, . . . , fn, g1, . . . , gn) with fj, gj ∈W \ {0}
(j = 1, . . . , n), there exists a dense subspace DFn ⊂F left invariant by
eiφ(fj), eiπ(gj), φ(fj) and π(gj) (j = 1, . . . , n) and, for j, k = 1, . . . , n,
[φ(fj), π(gk)] = i ⟨fj, gk⟩,
[φ(fj), φ(fk)] = 0,
[π(gj), π(gk)] = 0
on DFn.
(ii) For all f ∈WC, the operator Φ(f) deﬁned by (5.154) is essentially
self-adjoint and
eiΦ(f) = ei⟨Re f,Im f⟩/2eiφ(Re f)eiπ(Im f).
(5.171)
Moreover
eiΦ(f+g) = eiIm ⟨f,g⟩/2eiΦ(f)eiΦ(g), f, g ∈WC.
(5.172)
14For all ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B), eitSψ = eict2/2eitAeitBψ. Consider diﬀerentiating strongly
the both sides at t = 0.
 

300
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) As a natural generalization of the subspace D0 in Lemma 5.26,
one deﬁnes
DFn := span {Ψu(Fn)|u ∈C∞
0 (R2n), Ψ ∈F}
with
Ψu :=
Z
R2n u(t1, . . . , tn, s1, . . . , sn)eit1φ(f1) · · · eitnφ(fn)
× eis1π(g1) · · · eisnπ(gn)Ψ dt1 · · · dtnds1 · · · dsn.
Then, in the same way as in the case of D0, one can prove the desired
properties (cf. [Arai (2013), Appendix]).
(ii) By (5.157), we can apply Lemma 5.26 to the case where A = φ(Re f)
and B = π(Im f) and c = ⟨Re f, Im f⟩. Hence Φ(f) = φ(Re f) + π(Im f)
is essentially self-adjoint and (5.171) holds.
Taking f + g in place of f
in (5.171) and using the strong commutativity of {φ(Re f), φ(Re g)} (resp.
{π(Im f), π(Im g)}), we have
eiΦ(f+g) = ei⟨Re f+Re g,Im f+Im g⟩/2eiφ(Re f)eiφ(Re g)eiπ(Im f)eiπ(Im g).
By (5.157) again, we have eiφ(Re g)eiπ(Im f) = e−i⟨Re g,Im f⟩eiπ(Im f)eiφ(Re g).
Using these facts and (5.171), we obtain (5.172).
Remark 5.42. It is not so diﬃcult to show that (5.172) implies (5.157)–
(5.159). Hence (5.157)–(5.159) are equivalent to (5.172). From this point
view, one can generalize the concept of Weyl representation of CCR. Let X
be a Hilbert space and Y be a dense subspace of X . Let {Φ(f) | f ∈Y }
be a set of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space F and ω be a real
symplectic form on Y (see Remark 5.30). Then (F, {Φ(f) | f ∈Y }, ω) is
called a Weyl representation of the generalized CCR over (Y , ω) if
eiΦ(f+g) = eiω(f,g)/2eiΦ(f)eiΦ(g),
f, g ∈Y .
5.25
A Class of Representations of CCR
In this section we construct a class of representations of CCR from the Fock
representation of CCR. To understand an idea behind the construction, we
ﬁrst recall a geometric concept.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
301
5.25.1
Symplectic group on a Hilbert space
Let H be a Hilbert space with conjugation C (see Section 5.12). As a
natural generalization of the standard symplectic form on R2n (n ∈N), we
can deﬁne a mapping ω : (H ⊕H ) × (H ⊕H ) →C by
ω((f, g), (f ′, g′)) := ⟨Cf, g′⟩−⟨Cg, f ′⟩, (f, g), (f ′, g′) ∈H ⊕H .
The following properties of ω are easily proved:
(i) (complex bi-linearity) For all ψ, φ, χ ∈H ⊕H and α, β ∈C,
ω(α ψ + β φ, χ) = α ω(ψ, h) + β ω(φ, χ),
ω(χ, α ψ + β φ) = α ω(χ, ψ) + β ω(χ, φ).
(ii) (anti-symmetry) ω(ψ, φ) = −ω(φ, ψ), ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H .
(iii) (conjugation covariance) For all ψ, φ
∈
H ⊕H , ω(ψ, φ)∗
=
ω(Cψ, Cφ), where
C(f, g) := (Cf, Cg),
(f, g) ∈H ⊕H .
(iv) (non-degeneracy) Any vector ψ ∈H ⊕H satisfying ω(ψ, φ) = 0 for
all φ ∈H ⊕H is equal to the zero vector 0 in H ⊕H .
We call ω the standard symplectic form on H ⊕H with respect to C.
Note that this depends on C. In what follows, we ﬁx the conjugation C.
Let A be a bounded linear operator on H ⊕H (i.e., A ∈B(H ⊕H )).
Then, for all (f, g) ∈H ⊕H , ∥A(f, g)∥≤∥A∥
p
∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2. For each
f ∈H , let A(f, 0) := (g1, g2) ∈H ⊕H and A(0, f) := (h1, h2) ∈H ⊕H .
Then one can deﬁne linear operators Aij : H →H (i, j = 1, 2) as follows:
A11f := g1,
A21f := g2,
A12f := h1,
A22f := h2.
Since ∥A(f, 0)∥≤∥A∥∥f∥and ∥A(0, f)∥≤∥A∥∥f∥, it follows that each
Aij is bounded with ∥Aij∥≤∥A∥and A has an operator matrix represen-
tation (cf. Appendix B)
A =

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where I denotes the identity on H . Then ω is written as
ω(ψ, φ) = ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩H ⊕H ,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H .
(5.173)
An operator S ∈B(H ⊕H ) is called a symplectic transformation
if it is surjective and preserves the standard symplectic form: for all ψ, φ ∈
H ⊕H , ω(Sψ, Sφ) = ω(ψ, φ).
It follows that a symplectic transformation is injective and hence bijec-
tive. For each T ∈B(H ⊕H ), we deﬁne T ∈B(H ⊕H ) by
T := CT C.
This should not be confused with the closure of T which is equal to T in
the present case.15
Lemma 5.27. Let S ∈B(H ⊕H ). Then S is a symplectic transformation
if and only if it is surjective and
S
∗JS = J.
(5.174)
In that case, S−1 also is a symplectic transformation.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is due to the following equivalent deformations
of equation:
ω(Sψ, Sφ) = ω(ψ, φ) ⇐⇒⟨CSψ, JSφ⟩= ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒

SCψ, JSφ

= ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒
D
Cψ, S
∗JSφ
E
= ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒S
∗JSφ = Jφ,
φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒S
∗JS = J.
If S is surjective and (5.174) holds, then S
∗J = JS−1. It is easy to see
(S
∗)−1 = S−1 ∗(note that S
−1 = S−1). Hence S−1 ∗JS−1 = J. Thus S−1
is a symplectic transformation.
Lemma 5.27 implies that the set
Sp(H ) := {S ∈B(H ⊕H ) | S is symplectic}
= {S ∈B(H ⊕H ) | RanS = H ⊕H and S
∗JS = J}
is a group with the operation of operator product. This group is called the
symplectic group on H ⊕H with respect to C.
15To be strict, one should use a diﬀerent symbol for CTC. But it would make things
unnecessarily complicated.
 

Boson Fock Spaces
303
Let S ∈Sp(H ) and
S =
 S11 S12
S21 S22

be the operator matrix representation of S (Sij ∈B(H ), i.j = 1, 2). Then
(5.174) is equivalent to the following set of operator equations:
S11
∗S22 −S21
∗S12 = I,
(5.175)
S11
∗S21 −S21
∗S11 = 0,
(5.176)
S12
∗S22 −S22
∗S12 = 0.
(5.177)
In view of the conjugation C, the subset
H (C) := {(f, Cf) | f ∈H } ⊂H ⊕H
may be a natural subset. Indeed, C as a mapping on H ⊕H leaves H (C)
invariant bijectively: CH (C) = H (C).
We note the following fact:
Lemma 5.28. Let S ∈Sp(H ). Then S leaves H (C) invariant if and only
if
S12 = S21,
S22 = S11.
(5.178)
Proof. We have for all f ∈H
S(f, Cf) = (S11f + S12Cf, S21f + S22Cf).
Hence S(f, Cf)
∈
H (C) if and only CS11f + CS12Cf
=
S21f +
S22Cf · · · (∗).
Suppose that S(f, Cf) ∈H (C). Then (∗) holds. Replacing f by if, we
obtain
−CS11f + S12f = S21f −S22Cf.
Hence it follows that S12f = S21f and CS11f = S22Cf. Therefore (5.178)
hold.
Conversely, assume (5.178).
Then (∗) holds.
Hence S(f, Cf) ∈
H (C).
Based on Lemma 5.28, it is natural to introduce
SpC(H ) := {S ∈Sp(H ) | SH (C) ⊂H (C)},
a subset of Sp(H ). By Lemma 5.28, any S ∈SpC(H ) is of the form
S =
 S1 S2

(5.180)
For each S ∈SpC(H ) given by (5.179), the operator
S′ :=


−S∗

−S2


(5.181)
satisﬁes
S′S = I.
Since S is bijective, it follows that
S−1 = S′.
It may depend on {Sjk|j, k = 1, 2} if S−1 is in SpC(H ). But, using the
operator matrix representation (5.181), we obtain the following proposition:
Proposition 5.21. Let S ∈SpC(H ). Then S−1 ∈SpC(H ) if and only if
S1S∗
1 −S2S2
∗= I,
S2S1
∗−S1S∗
2 = 0.
(5.182)
Proof. We need only to apply condition (5.180) with (S1, S2) replaced by
(S∗
1, −S2
∗).
It follows from the facts proved above that the set
Sp×
C (H ) := {S ∈Sp(H ) | S satisﬁes (5.180) and (5.182)}
forms a subgroup of Sp(H ), satisfying SH (C) = H (C) for all S ∈
Sp×
C (H ).
5.25.2
Bogoliubov transformations
Now we are ready to construct a class of representations of CCR.
Let S ∈SpC(H ) be given by (5.179) and V be a dense subspace of H
such that
CV ⊂V , S1V ⊂V , S2V ⊂V .
Then it is easy to see that SjV ⊂V (j = 1, 2).
Let L : V →C be a linear functional. For all f ∈V , the operator
A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗is densely deﬁned and closable. Hence one can deﬁne
a densely deﬁned closed operator B(f) on Fb(H ) by
B(f) := A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗+ L(f)∗.
(5.183)
It follows that
B(f)∗= (A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗)∗+ L(f) ⊃A(S1f)∗+ A(CS2f) + L(f).
Lemma 5.29. The triplet (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {B(f) | f ∈V }) is a repre-
sentation of the CCR over V .
 

Boson Fock Spaces
305
Proof. The anti-linearity of B(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(V ) in f is easily seen.
It is
easy to see that, for all f ∈V , B(f)#Fb,ﬁn(V ) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(V ) and, for all
Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(V ),
[B(f), B(g)∗]Ψ = [A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗, A(S1g)∗+ A(CS2g)]Ψ
= (⟨S1f, S1g⟩−⟨CS2g, CS2f⟩)Ψ
= ⟨f, (S∗
1S1 −S∗
2S2)g⟩Ψ = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ,
where we have used the ﬁrst equation in (5.180). Similarly, using the second
equation in (5.180), we can show that [B(f), B(g)]Ψ = 0.
The correspondence {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V 7→{B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V is called
the Bogoliubov transformation associated with (S, L). We write it also
(A(·), A(·)∗) 7→(B(·), B(·)∗).
In particular, the Bogoliubov transformation associated with (I, L)
(S1 = I and S2 = 0) is called the Bogoliubov translation with respect
to the linear functional L. In this case, B(f) takes the form
BL(f) := A(f) + L(f)∗,
f ∈V ,
(5.184)
which has appeared in Example 5.9. In this context, L is called the trans-
lation functional. As mentioned in Example 5.9, (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ),
{BL(f)|f ∈V }) is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V .
Remark 5.43. The concept of Bogoliubov transformation can be ex-
tended to the case where {A(f)|f ∈V } is replaced by any representation
(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) of the CCR over V .
It is interesting to investigate conditions for {B(f) | f ∈V } to be equiv-
alent or inequivalent to {A(f) | f ∈V }. From this point of view, we intro-
duce the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 5.9. The Bogoliubov transformation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V
7→
{B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V is said to be proper (resp. improper) if {B(f) | f ∈V }
is equivalent (resp. inequivalent) to {A(f) | f ∈V }.
Remark 5.44. Since {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V is irreducible, the above deﬁnition
may be meaningful only if {B(f), B(f)∗|f ∈V } is irreducible (see Remark
5.25). In Lemma 5.32 below, we show that, under an additional condition,
{B(f), B(f)∗|f ∈V } is irreducible.
We ﬁrst discuss Bogoliubov translations in the next subsection. As for
general Bogoliubov transformations, however, we give only partial analysis.

5.25.3
Analysis of Bogoliubov translations
Theorem 5.46. The Bogoliubov translation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V 7→{BL(f),
BL(f)∗}f∈V is proper if and only if there exists a vector h ∈H such that
L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩H , f ∈V .
Proof. Suppose that the Bogoliubov translation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V 7→
{BL(f), BL(f)∗}f∈V is proper.
Then there exists a unitary operator
U on Fb(H ) such that UBL(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V .
Hence, letting
Ω:= U −1ΩH , we have BL(f)Ω= 0 and ∥Ω∥= 1.
These imply that
A(f)Ω= −L(f)∗Ωand there exists an n ∈{0} ∪N such that Ω(n) ̸= 0.
We deﬁne Ψn ∈Fb,0(H ) by Ψ(n)
n
:= Ω(n) and Ψ(m)
n
= 0, m ̸= n and put
ωn := ⟨Ω, Ψn⟩= ∥Ω(n)∥2 ̸= 0. Then
L(f) = −1
ωn
⟨A(f)Ω, Ψn⟩= −1
ωn
⟨Ω, A(f)∗Ψn⟩.
By the Schwarz inequality and (5.52), we obtain
|L(f)| ≤1
ωn
∥A(f)∗Ψn∥≤Cn∥f∥,
f ∈V ,
with Cn := ∥(Nb + 1)1/2Ψn∥/ωn =
p
(n + 1)/ωn. Hence L is bounded.
Since V is dense, it follows from the extension theorem that there exists
a unique eL ∈H ∗such that eL(f) = L(f), f ∈V . Therefore, by Riesz’s
representation theorem, there exists a unique vector h ∈H such that
eL(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈H . In particular, we have L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V .
Conversely, suppose that there exists a vector h ∈H such that L(f) =
⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V . Then, by (5.116), we have
ei
√
2 ΦS(ih)A(f)e−i
√
2 ΦS(ih) = BL(f).
Hence A(f) and BL(f) are unitarily equivalent. Thus the Bogoliubov trans-
lation (A(·), A(·)∗) 7→(BL(·), BL(·)∗) is proper.
We next examine if {BL(f), BL(f)∗}f∈V induces a Weyl representa-
tion of CCR. Let C be a conjugation on H
and (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ),
{φL(f), πL(f) | f ∈VC}) be the representation of the Heisenberg CCR in-
duced by {B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V :
φL(f) :=

2(BL(f)∗+ BL(f)),

πL(f) :=

2(BL(f)∗−BL(f)).

Lemma 5.30. For all f ∈VC, φL(f) (resp.
πL(f)) is essentially self-
adjoint on any core Dc of φF(f) (resp. πF(f)) such that Dc ⊂D(A(f)) ∩
D(A(f)∗), and
φL(f) = φF(f) + 1
√
2(L(f) + L(f)∗),
(5.187)
πL(f) = πF(f) +
i
√
2(L(f) −L(f)∗).
(5.188)
Moreover, (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is an irreducible Weyl repre-
sentation of the CCR over VC.
Proof. Let Dc be any core of φF(f) such that Dc ⊂D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗).
By (5.184), (5.185) and (5.186),
φL(f) = φF(f) + 1
√
2(L(f) + L(f)∗) on Dc.
Since φF(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Dc and (L(f) + L(f)∗)/
√
2 is a
scalar operator, it follows that φL(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Dc and
(5.187) holds. The statment for πL(f) can be similarly proved.
By (5.187) and (5.188), we have
eiφL(f) = eiφF(f)eicL, eiπL(f) = eiπF(f)eidL,
(5.189)
where cL := (L(f) + L(f)∗)/
√
2 and dL := i(L(f) −L(f)∗)/
√
2. These
relations and the Weyl relations of {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈VC} imply that
(Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is a Weyl representation of the CCR
over VC. The irreducibility of this Weyl representation follows from (5.189)
and the irreducibility of {eiφF(f), eiπF(f)|f ∈VC}.
Theorem 5.47. The Weyl representation (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f
∈
VC}) is equivalent to the Fock representation (Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈
VC}) if and only if there exists a vector h ∈H
such that L(f) =
⟨h, f⟩H , f ∈V .
Proof. Suppose that (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is equivalent to
(Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈VC}). Then there exists a unitary operator
W on Fb(H ) such that, for all f ∈VC, WφL(f)W −1 = φF(f) and
WπL(f)W −1 = φF(f). By (5.185) and (5.186),
BL(f) =
1
√
2(φL(f) + iπL(f)) ⊂
1
√
2(φL(f) + iπL(f)).
Hence
WBL(f)W −1 ⊂
1
√
2φF(f) + iπF(f).

Let Θ := WΩH . Then WBL(f)W −1Θ = L(f)∗Θ. Since ∥Θ∥= 1, there
exists an n ∈{0} ∪N such that Θ(n) ̸= 0. We deﬁne Φn ∈Fb,0(H ) by
Φ(n)
n
= Θ(n) and Φ(m)
n
= 0, m ̸= n. Then Φn ∈D(φF(f)) ∩D(πF(f)) and
[φF(f) −iπF(f)]Φn/
√
2 = A(f)∗Φn. Hence L(f) ⟨Θ, Φn⟩= ⟨Θ, A(f)∗Φn⟩.
Hence L(f) = ⟨Θ, A(f)∗Φn⟩/νn with νn := ∥Θ(n)∥2 > 0. By the linearity
of L(g) and A(g)∗in g ∈H , this equation extends to all f ∈V . Therefore
|L(f)| ≤1
νn
∥A(f)∗Φn∥≤
r
n + 1
νn
∥f∥,
f ∈V .
Thus, by Riesz’s representation theorem, there exists a vector h ∈H such
that L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V .
Conversely, suppose that there exists a vector h ∈H such that L(f) =
⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V . Then, by Theorem 5.46, there exists a unitary operator U
on Fb(H ) such that UBL(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V . Hence, for all f ∈VC,
UφL(f)U −1 ⊂φF(f),
UπL(f)U −1 ⊂πF(f).
Taking closures, we obtain
UφL(f)U −1 ⊂φF(f),
UπL(f)U −1 ⊂πF(f).
But UφL(f)U −1 and UπL(f)U −1 are self-adjoint. Hence
UφL(f)U −1 = φF(f),
UπL(f)U −1 = πF(f).
Thus (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is equivalent to (Fb(H ), {φF(f),
πF(f) |f ∈VC}).
Theorem 5.46 (resp. Theorem 5.47) implies the existence of inﬁnitely
many improper irreducible Bogoliubov translations (resp. inﬁnitely many
irreducible Weyl representations inequivalent to the Fock representation).
Here we give only a simple example in such representations.
Example 5.21. Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H and D
be a core for T such that CD ⊂D. Let g ∈H . Then LT : D →C deﬁned
by
LT(f) := ⟨g, T f⟩,
f ∈D
is a linear functional. It is easy to see that there exists a vector h ∈H
such that LT (f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈D if and only if g ∈D(T ∗) and, in that case,
h = T ∗g. Thus, by Theorem 5.46, we obtain the following fact:
(i) The Bogoliubov translation
{A(f), A(f)∗}f∈D 7→{BLT (f), BLT (f)∗}f∈D
is proper (resp. improper) if and only if g ∈D(T ∗) (resp. g ̸∈D(T ∗)).
(ii) The Weyl representation (Fb(H ), {φLT (f), πLT (f)|f ∈DC}) is equiv-
alent (resp. inequivalent) to the Fock representation (Fb(H ), {φF(f),
πF(f)|f ∈DC}) if and only if g ∈D(T ∗) (resp. g ̸∈D(T ∗)).

5.25.4
A general case of Bogoliubov transformations
Let us come back to the original Bogoliubov transformation (5.183). In this
case, letting CS(f) := B(f) −L(f)∗(f ∈V ), we have
B(f) = CS(f) + L(f)∗,
CS(f) = A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗.
Note that B(·) is a Bogoliubov translation of CS(·) in the extended sense
(Remark 5.43). Hence it may be enough to consider the Bogoliubov trans-
formation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V 7→{CS(f), CS(f)∗}f∈V .
Before stating a fundamental fact on this Bogoliubov transformation,
we note a lemma.
Lemma 5.31. The operator S1 is injective and S∗
1 is surjective.
Proof. By the ﬁrst equation of (5.180), we have S∗
1S1 = I + S∗
2S2. Since
S∗
2S2 is a non-negative self-adjoint operator, S∗
1S1 is bijective. This implies
the statement of the present lemma.
Theorem 5.48. Assume that H is separable. Let S ∈SpC(H ) such that
RanS1 = H .
Suppose that S2 is not Hilbert-Schmidt.16
Then the Bo-
goliubov transformation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V 7→{CS(f), CS(f)∗}f∈V is im-
proper.
Proof. We prove the contraposition. Hence suppose that the Bogoliubov
transformation under consideration is proper. Then there exists a unitary
operator U on Fb(H ) such that UCS(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V . Let Ω:=
U −1ΩH . Then CS(f)Ω= 0, i.e., (A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗)Ω= 0. Hence, for
all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), ⟨A(S1f)∗Ψ, Ω⟩= −⟨A(CS2f)Ψ, Ω⟩. By the density of
V and Lemma 5.7(iii), this equation is extended to all f ∈H . By Lemma
5.31 and the present assumption on S1, S1 is bijective.
Hence, putting
K := S2S−1
1 , we have for all f ∈H , ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, Ω⟩= −⟨A(CKf)Ψ, Ω⟩.
Taking Ψ = ΩH , we obtain
D
f, Ω(1)E
= 0,
f ∈H .
Hence Ω(1) = 0.
We next take any vector in the n-particle space as Ψ with n ≥1. Then
we haveD
(A(f)∗Ψ)(n+1), Ω(n+1)E
= −
D
(A(CKf)Ψ)(n−1), Ω(n−1)E
16Cf. Chapter 3, Problem 1.
 

310
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
for all n ≥1 and Ψ ∈⊗n
s H . For each n ≥1, we deﬁne a vector Ωn in the
n-particle space by Ω(n)
n
:= Ω(n) and Ω(m)
n
:= 0, m ̸= n. Then the above
equation implies that ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, Ωn+1⟩= −⟨A(CKf)Ψ, Ωn−1⟩for all n ≥1
and Ψ ∈⊗n
s H . Hence
A(f)Ωn+1 = −A(CKf)∗Ωn−1,
f ∈H .
(5.190)
Since Ω(1) = 0 as we have seen above, Ω1 = 0. Hecne, by (5.190) with
n = 2, A(f)Ω3 = 0 for all f ∈H . Hence, by Proposition 5.6, Ω3 = 0.
By repeating this process with (5.190), we can show by induction in n that
Ω2n−1 = 0 for all n ≥1.
As for Ω2n, by (5.190), we ﬁrst have A(f)Ω2 = −cA(CKf)∗ΩH , where
c := Ω(0) ∈C. If c = 0, then A(f)Ω2 = 0. Hence, by Proposition 5.6
again, Ω2 = 0.
Then, in the same way as above, we obtain Ω2n = 0
for all n ≥0. Thus Ω= 0. But this is a contradiction. Hence c ̸= 0.
Therefore ∥A(CKf)∗ΩH ∥2 = ∥A(f)Ω2∥2/|c|2. The left hand side is equal
to ∥CKf∥2 = ∥Kf∥2. Hence ∥Kf∥2 = ∥A(f)Ω2∥2/|c|2. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a
CONS of H . Then

Ω2∥2 < ∞,
where we have used (5.74). Hence K is Hilbert-Schmidt. Thus S2 = KS1
is Hilbert-Schmidt.17
Lemma 5.32. Let S ∈Sp×
C (H ). Then {CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V } is irre-
ducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V }′. Then T CS(f)# ⊂CS(f)#T ,
f ∈V . Using (5.182), one can express A(f) in terms of CS(·)#. Namely,
for all f ∈V ,
A(f) = CS(S∗
1f) −CS(S∗
2Cf)∗,
A(f)∗= CS(S∗
1f)∗−CS(S∗
2Cf)
on Fb,0(H ). Hence, for all Φ, Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), we have
⟨T A(f)Φ, Ψ⟩= ⟨T Φ, A(f)∗Ψ⟩.
Since Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f)∗, it follows that T Φ ∈D((A(f)∗)∗) =
D(A(f)) and A(f)T Φ = T A(f)Φ. Since Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f), it
follows from a limiting argument that T A(f) ⊂A(f)T . Simiarly one can
show that T A(f)∗⊂A(f)∗T . Hence T ∈{A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈V }′ = CI.
Therefore T = cI for some c ∈C. Hence {CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V }′ = CI.
Thus {CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V } is irreducible.
17Recall that, if T is Hilbert-Schmidt on a Hilbert space X , then, for all A ∈B(X ),
AT and TA are Hilbert-Schmidt.

With regard to the converse of Theorem 5.48, the following fact is
known:
Theorem 5.49. Let S ∈Sp×
C (H ). Suppose that S2 is Hilbert-Schmidt.
Then the Bogoliubov transformation
{A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V 7→{CS(f), CS(f)∗}f∈V
is proper.
We do not prove this theorem here. For proofs of Theorem 5.49, see,
e.g., [Reed and Simon (1979), Theorems XI.106 and XI.108] and [Hiroshima
et al. (2012), Chapter 2].
Example 5.22. Let U be a unitary operator on H and consider the case
where
S1 = U cosh θ,
S2 = U sinh θ,
θ ∈R.
Then it is easy to check that
S =
U cosh θ ¯U sinh θ
U sinh θ ¯U cosh θ

is an element in Sp×
C(H ). In this case CS(f) takes the form
CU,θ(f) := A(U(cosh θ)f) + A(CU(sinh θ)f)∗,
f ∈H .
If θ ̸= 0 and dim H = ∞, then U sinh θ is not Hilbert-Schmidt. Thus, by
Theorem 5.48, if θ ̸= 0 and dim H = ∞, then the Bogoliubov transforma-
tion (A(·), A(·)∗) 7→(CU,θ(·), CU,θ(·)∗) is improper, i.e., the representation
{CU,θ(f), CU,θ(f)∗|f ∈H } of the CCR over H is inequivalent to the Fock
representation {A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈H }.

Functional Schr¨odinger Representation of Heisenberg

0 (RN), {qn, pn|n = 1, . . . , N})
(N = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
of Heisenberg CCR (see Remark 5.34). In this section, we show that, in
the case of inﬁnite degrees of freedom too, there exist representations cor-
responding to Schr¨odinger representations with ﬁnite degrees of freedom.

Heuristic arguments
Heuristically one may infer that a Schr¨odinger representation of the Heisen-
berg CCR with countably inﬁnite degrees of freedom, if it exists, should
be obtained as π(N)
S
with N = ∞. Unfortunately, however, the Lebesgue
measure on R∞does not exist. Hence L2(R∞) does not make sense.
An idea to avoid this diﬃculty is to change the representation space from
L2(RN) to L2(RN, dmN) with a ﬁnite measure m on (R, B1) such that the
countably inﬁnite product measure of m may exist. As we see below, one
of such measures m is the Gaussian measure µg on (R, B1) deﬁned by
µg(B) :=
1
√π
Z
B
e−x2dx,
B ∈B1.
One has µg(R) = 1. Hence µg is a probability measure on (R, B1). The
N-product measure µ(N)
g
:= ⊗Nµg of µg on (RN, BN) takes the form
µ(N)
g
(E) =
1
πN/2
Z
E
e−|x|2dx,
E ∈BN.
The measure µ(N)
g
is a probability measure on (RN, BN).
Hence
(RN, BN, µ(N)
g
) is a probability space.
For all f ∈L2(RN), e|x|2/2f ∈L2(RN, dµ(N)
g
). Hence one can deﬁne a
mapping uN : L2(RN) →L2(R, dµN
g ) by
(uNf)(x) := πN/4e|x|2/2f(x),
f ∈L2(RN), a.e.x ∈RN.
It is easy to see that uN is unitary. Let
q′
n := uNqnu−1
N ,
p′
n := uNpnu−1
N .
Then
q′
n = xn,
p′
n = −iDxn + ixn,
(5.191)
where xn is the multiplication operator by xn on L2(RN, dµ(N)
g
). Thus
π(N)
S
′ := (L2(RN, dµ(N)
g
), C∞
0 (RN), {q′
n, p′
n | n ∈N})
is a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with N degrees of freedom equiv-
alent to the Schr¨odinger representation π(N)
S
. We show below that there
exists a version of π(N)
S
′ with N = ∞.

Existence of a probability space with an inﬁnite
dimensional measure
Let ˙R := R ∪{∞} be the one-point compactiﬁcation of R.
Then ˙R is
a compact Hausdorﬀspace. Hence, by Tychonoﬀ’s theorem, the inﬁnite
product
˙R∞=
∞
Y
n=1
˙R = {ω = (ωn)∞
n=1 | ωn ∈˙R}
of ˙R is a compact Hausdorﬀspace. For each n ∈N, we deﬁne φn : ˙R∞→R
as follows:
φn(ω) :=
 ωn ; ωn ̸= ∞
0 ; ωn = ∞.
Let B∞be the Borel ﬁeld generated by open sets of ˙R∞. The following
theorem is concerned with existence of a probability measure on ( ˙R∞, B∞).
Theorem 5.50. There exists a probability measure µ on ( ˙R∞, B∞) such
that, for all N ∈N, nj ∈N (j = 1, . . . , N) with n1 < n2 < · · · < nN and
B ∈BN,
µ({ω ∈˙R∞|(φn1(ω), . . . , φnN (ω)) ∈B}) = µ(N)
g
(B).
Proof. We need only to apply Kolmogorov’s theorem. For the details, see,
e.g., [Simon (1979), §2]. A detailed description for existence theorems of
inﬁnite dimensional measures is found in [Arai (2010), Appendix D].
The probability measure µ in Theorem 5.50 is called the inﬁnite product
measure of µg. Thus we have a probability space ( ˙R∞, B∞, µ).
In terms of terminology in probability theory, Theorem 5.50 means that
the joint distribution of the random vector (φn1, . . . , φnN ) is given by µN
g .
Hence, for all Borel functions f : RN →C,
Z

Hence (5.194) holds.
By Lemma 5.33(i), for each complex polynomial P(t1, . . . , tN) of N real
variables tj (N ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N), the composite function P(φ1, . . . , φN)
on ˙R∞is in L2( ˙R∞, dµ). Hence the set
P0 := {P(φ1, . . . , φN) | N ∈N, P is a complex polynomial
of N real variables}
is a subspace of L2( ˙R∞, dµ).
The Borel ﬁeld B∞may be too large to consider only functions made
from φn, n ∈N. Hence it would be better to restrict ourselves to a smaller
and a natural Borel ﬁeld. Such a Borel ﬁeld is given by the Borel ﬁeld
generated by {φn|n ∈N} (i.e. the smallest Borel ﬁeld such that all φn are
measurable). We denote it by Σ∞. An advantage of this choice is seen in
the following lemma.
Lemma 5.34. The subspace P0 is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dµ).
 

Boson Fock Spaces

Proof. (outline) Let S (RN) be the Schwartz test function space of rapidly
decreasing functions on RN and, for F ∈S (RN),
ˆF(k) :=

(2π)N/2
Z
RN e−ik·xF(x)dx,
k ∈RN,
be the Fourier transform of F, where k · x := PN
j=1 kjxj. By the deﬁnition
of Σ∞, the set {φn|n ∈N} of random variables is full in the probability
space ( ˙R∞, Σ∞, µ). 18 Hence, by a general theory of random variables (see,
e.g., [Simon (1974), Lemma I.5]),
Aφ := span {F(φ1, . . . , φN) | N ∈N, F ∈S (RN)}
is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dµ). Using the inversion formula
F(φ1, . . . , φN) =

j=1 kjφj ˆF(k1, . . . , kN)dk1 · · · dkN,
where the integral on the right hand side is taken in the strong topology
of L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dµ), we see that F(φ1, . . . , φN) is obtained as a limit of a
sequence in
Wφ := span {eik1φ1 · · · eikN φN|N ∈N, kj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , N}.
Hence Wφ is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dµ). Then, using th expansion eikjφj =
P∞
ℓ=0(ikj)ℓφℓ
j/ℓ! and
Z
˙R∞ec|φj|dµ =
1
√π
Z

ec|x|e−x2dx < ∞,
we see that eik1φ1 · · · eikNφN is obtained as a limit of a sequence in P0.
Thus P0 is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dµ).
5.26.3
Representation of the Heisenberg CCR with
countable inﬁnite degrees of freedom
In what follows, we set
L2( ˙R∞, dµ) := L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dµ).
For each n, we deﬁne a linear operator ˆqn on L2( ˙R∞, dµ) as follows:
D(ˆqn) :=

Ψ ∈L2( ˙R∞, dµ) |
Z
˙R∞|φn|2|Ψ|2dµ < ∞

(ˆqnΨ)(ω) := φn(ω)Ψ(ω),
a.e.ω.
18A set {fα}α∈A (A is an index set) of random variables on a probability space (M, B, ν)
is said to be full if the Borel ﬁeld B is generated by {fα}α∈A.
 

316
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that ˆqn is self-adjoint.
For a complex polynomial P(t1, t2, . . .) of a ﬁnite number of real vari-
ables t1, t2, . . ., we deﬁne a function P(φ1, φ2, . . .) on ˙R∞by
P(φ1, φ2, . . .)(ω) := P(φ1(ω), φ2(ω), . . .),
ω ∈˙R∞.
We denote by ∂nP (n ∈N) the partial derivative of P in the nth variable tn.
Note that (∂nP)(φ1, φ2, . . .) ∈P0. Hence one can deﬁne a linear operator
ˆ∂n on L2( ˙R∞, dµ) as follows:
D(ˆ∂n) := P0,
ˆ∂nP(φ1, φ2, . . .) := (∂nP)(φ1, φ2, . . .), P(φ1, φ2, . . .) ∈D(ˆ∂n).
Lemma 5.35. For all n ∈N, ˆ∂∗
n ⊃−ˆ∂n + 2ˆqn.
Proof. Let F := P(φ1, φ2, . . .), G := Q(φ1, φ2, . . .) ∈P0. Without loss of
generality, we can assume that, for some N ∈N, P and Q depend on only
at most N real variables. Hence, by integration by parts, we have

This means that P0 ⊂D(ˆ∂∗
n) and ˆ∂∗
n ↾P0 = (−ˆ∂n + 2ˆqn) (note that
D(ˆqn) ⊃P0 and hence D(−ˆ∂n + 2ˆqn) = P0).
By Lemma 5.35, for all n ∈N, the operator
ˆπn := −iˆ∂n + iˆqn
(5.195)
is a symmetric operator. Moreover, we have the following fact:
Lemma 5.36. For all n ∈N, ˆπn is essentially self-adjoint.
Proof. (outline) By a general criterion, we need only to show that
Ran(ˆπn±i) are dense in L2( ˙R∞, dµ). This is equivalent to [Ran(ˆπn±i)]⊥=
{0}. Hence we show the latter. Let

and ν(n) be the inﬁnite product measure of µg on Xn. Let Ψ ∈[Ran(ˆπn +
i)]⊥. Then, using the natural identiﬁcation
L2( ˙R∞, dµ) = L2(Rx × Xn, dµg ⊗dν(n))
and Fubini’s theorem, one can show that, for all complex polynomials f
and g of one variable and a ﬁnite number of real variables respectively
Z
R
D
eΨ, (−iDx + ix + i)f
E
L2(Rx,dµg) g(x1, . . . , xn−1, xn+1, . . .)dν(n) = 0,
where eΨ ∈L2(Rx, dµg) is deﬁned by eΨ(x) := Ψ(x1, . . . , xn−1, x, xn+1, . . .).
Since the subspace spanned by such g’s is dense in L2(Xn, dν(n)),
D
eΨ, (−iDx + ix + i)f
E
L2(Rx,dµg) = 0 for ν(n)-a.e. (x1, . . . , xn−1, xn+1, . . .).
On the other hand, −iDx + ix is unitarily equivalent to −iDx on L2(R)
(cf. (5.191) with n = N = 1). Hence it follows that −iDx +ix is essentially
self-adjoint on the subspace spanned by complex polynomials of one real
veriable. Hence, for ν(n)-a.e.(x1, . . . , xn−1, xn+1, . . .), eΨ = 0 as an element
of L2(Rx, dµg). Therefore Ψ = 0. Thus [Ran(ˆπn + i)]⊥= {0}. Similarly
one can show that [Ran(ˆπn −i)]⊥= {0}.
Lemma 5.37. For each n ∈N, ˆqn and ˆπn leave P0 invariant and, for all
n, m ∈N,
[ˆqn, ˆπm] = iδnm,
(5.196)
[ˆqn, ˆqm] = 0,
[ˆπn, ˆπm] = 0
(5.197)
on P0.
Proof. The invarinat properties ˆqnP0 ⊂P0 and ˆπnP0 ⊂P0 follow the
deﬁnitions of ˆqn and ˆπn. Commutation relations (5.196) and (5.197) follow
from direct computations.
Lemma 5.37 shows that
π∞
S := (L2( ˙R∞, dµ), P0, {ˆqn, ˆπn|n ∈N})
is a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with countable inﬁnite degrees of
freedom. We call this representation the Schr¨odinger representation of
the Heisenberg CCR with countable inﬁnite degrees of freedom.

5.26.4
Functionalizations
We want to bring the Schr¨odinger representation π∞
S to a simple and uniﬁed
form.
Let H be a real separable Hilbert space and {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of
H . Then any f ∈H has the expansion
f =

X
n=1
an(f)en,
an(f) := ⟨en, f⟩.
By the Parseval equality, we have
∥f∥2 =
∞
X
n=1
|an(f)|2 < ∞.
By Lemma 5.33, {

2φn}n is an ONS in L2( ˙R∞, dµ). Hence, by the abstract
Riesz-Fischer theorem (Theorem 2.2),
φ(f) :=
∞
X
n=1
an(f)φn
(5.198)
converges in L2( ˙R∞, dµ). Hence φ(f) ∈L2( ˙R∞, dµ) and its L2( ˙R∞, dµ)-
norm ∥φ(f)∥L2( ˙R∞,dµ) takes the form
∥φ(f)∥2
L2( ˙R∞,dµ) =
∞
X
n=1
|an(f)|2

2∥f∥2.
It is obvious that
φ(en) = φn,
n ∈N.
(5.199)
Moreover, it is easy to see that
φ(af + bg) = aφ(f) + bφ(g),
f, g ∈H , a, b ∈R,
as an equality in L2( ˙R∞, dµ).
In what follows, we sometimes omit the variable ω ∈˙R∞in the notation
of a function F : ˙R∞→{±∞} ∪C and denote by ⟨F⟩the integral of F
with respect to the measure µ:
⟨F⟩:=

Lemma 5.38. For all f ∈H ,

lim
N→∞∥φ(f)N −φ(f)∥L2( ˙R∞,dµ) = 0.

Hence limN→∞

Thus (5.200) holds.
5.26.5
Lp-integrability of φ(f)
To prove Lp-integrability of φ(f), we recall a basic fact. Let (M, B, ν) be a
probability space and X : M →R∪{±∞} (M ∋m 7→X(m) ∈R∪{±∞})
be B-measurable and ν-a.e. ﬁnite (such a X is called a random variable
on (M, B)). Then the characteristic function CX of X is deﬁned by
CX(t) :=
Z
M
eitX(m)dν(m),
t ∈R.
(5.201)
The mapping P X : B1 →[0, ∞) deﬁned by
P X(B) := ν({m ∈M|X(m) ∈B}),
B ∈B1
is called the probability distribution of X. Indeed, it is easy to see that P X
is a probability measure on (R, B1) and
CX(t) =
Z
R
eitxdP X(x).
(5.202)
It is well known that P X is uniquely determined by CX19.
19This is proved by using L´evy’s inversion formula. See textbooks on probability theory.
A detailed description on these aspects is found in [Arai (2010), §1.9].

If P X is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure
with dP X(x) = ρ(x)dx (ρ is the Radon-Nykod´ym derivative) and CX ∈

R
R eitxdP φ(f)(x). It
is easy to see that P φ(f) given by (5.204) satisﬁes this equation.20
For an open subset D in Rd (d ∈N), we denote by Cn(D) the set of
n times continuously diﬀerentiable functions on D. In the case d = 1, for
f ∈Cn(D) and k = 1, . . . , n, we denote the kth derivative of f by f (k).
Lemma 5.40. Let n ∈N.
Suppose that CX ∈C2n(I), where I ⊂R

Proof. We prove the statement by induction in n.
We set C := CX.
Suppose that C ∈C2(I). Using the well known formula for the second
derivative of a twice continuously diﬀerentiable function, we have
−C′′(t) = lim

The function eitX is diﬀerentiable in t ∈I for ν-a.e. m ∈M and

Note that |iXeitX| = |X| is integrable and independent of t. Hence one
can exchange, in (5.201), the order of the integration with respect to ν and
the diﬀerentiation in t to obtain (5.205) with k = 1.
Next suppose that the statement of the present lemma holds for some
n.
Let C ∈C2n+2(I).
Let F(t) := C(2n)(t).
Then, by the induction
hypothesis,
F(t) = i2n

We note that F ∈C2(I). Hence we can apply to F arguments similar to

Formula (5.205) with k = 2n + 1 can be proved in the same way as in the
case n = 1 and k = 1.

The point of Lemma 5.40 is that regularities of CX imply integrabilities
of X.
We now apply Lemma 5.40 to X = φ(f).
Lemma 5.41. For all f ∈H and p > 0,
R
˙R∞|φ(f)|pdµ < ∞.
Proof. Let C(t) :=

eitφ(f)
. Then, by (5.200),
C(t) = e−t2∥f∥2/4.
Hence C is iniﬁnitely diﬀerentiable in t. Therefore, by Lemma 5.40, for all
n ∈N,
R
˙R∞|φ(f)|ndµ < ∞.
For any p > 0, there exists an n ∈N such that p ≤n. Then

Lemma 5.42. For all z ∈C and f ∈H ,
R
e|z| |φ(f)|dµ < ∞and
D
ezφ(f)E
= ez2∥f∥2/4.
Proof. The case f = 0 is trivial. Hence let f ̸= 0. By Lemma 5.39, we
have

e|z||φ(f)|E

√π ∥f∥
Z
R
e|z||x|e−x2/∥f∥2dx < ∞.
Thus the ﬁrst half of the lemma is proved. By Lemma 5.39 again, we have

R
ezxe−x2/∥f∥2dx.
It is easy to see that the right hand side is equal to ez2∥f∥2/4.
For a.e. ω ∈˙R∞, the function ezφ(f)−z2∥f∥2/4 of z ∈C is entire analytic.
Hence we have the expansion
ezφ(f)−z2∥f∥2/4 =

The random variable : φ(f)n : is called the Wick product of φ(f) of
order n.
It follows from the deﬁnition of : φ(f)n : that
: φ(f)0 := 1,
: φ(f) := φ(f)

all p ≥1.
By (5.207), we have
ezφ(f) =

This gives the inversion formula for (5.208).

so that

The following lemma shows that the inﬁnite series on the right hand side

The right hand side is integrable by Lemma 5.42. Hence, by (5.207) and
the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we obtain (5.210).
Proposition 5.22. For all n, m ∈{0} ∪N and f, g ∈H ,

see that the left hand side is equal to ets⟨f,g⟩/2. Comparing the coeﬃcient
of tnsm in the both sides, we obtain (5.211).
We extend the concept of Wick products. For all f1, . . . , fn ∈H (n ∈

We denote by DW the subspace algebraically spanned by 1 and Wick

DW := span {1, : φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : | n ∈N, fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n}.
Lemma 5.44. The subspace DW is dense in L2( ˙R∞, dµ).
Proof. Let tj ∈R and fj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N). Then, by (5.209),
we have

see that φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) is given by a linear combination of Wick prod-

span {1, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) | n ∈N, fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n} ⊂DW. On the other
hand, it is obvious that P0 ⊂span {1, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) | n ∈N, fj ∈H , j =
1, . . . , n}. By Lemma 5.34, P0 is dense in L2( ˙R∞, dµ). Thus the desired
result follows.

Proof. By Proposition 5.23, EW is an ONS in L2( ˙R∞, dµ).
Let fj ∈

is dense in L2( ˙R∞, dµ). Thus EW is a CONS of L2( ˙R∞, dµ).
5.26.7
An orthogonal decomposition
For each n ≥0, we introduce a closed subspace Γn(H ) of L2( ˙R∞, dµ) as
follows: Γ0(H ) := {z1|z ∈C} (1 is the constant function on ˙R∞with value
1) and
Γn(H ) := span {: φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : | fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n}.
By Proposition 5.23, for all n, m ∈N with n ̸= m, Γn(H ) is orthogonal to
Γm(H ):
Γn(H ) ⊥Γm(H ),
n ̸= m.
Moreover, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 5.52 (Itˆo-Segal-Wiener decomposition).
L2( ˙R∞, dµ) = ⊕∞
n=0Γn(H ).
Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.51.

5.26.8
A natural isomorphism with a boson Fock space
The Hilbert space L2( ˙R∞, dµ) has a natural isomorphism with the boson
Fock space Fb(HC) over HC, the complexiﬁcation of H .
Theorem
5.53. There exists a unique unitary transformation U
:
Fb(HC) →L2( ˙R∞, dµ) such that UΩHC = 1 and, for all n ∈N and
fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n,
UA(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩHC = 2n/2 : φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : .
(5.212)
Proof. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H . Then this is a CONS of HC too.
Hence, by Theorem 5.12, {ΩHC, Cj1···jnA(ej1)∗· · · A(ejn)∗ΩHC/
√
n!|n ∈
N, j1 ≤· · · ≤jn, jk ∈N, k = 1, . . . , n} is a CONS of Fb(HC). Moreover, we
have Theorem 5.51. Hence, by the isomorphism theorem (Theorem 2.4),
there exists a unique unitary transformation U : Fb(HC) →L2( ˙R∞, dµ)
such that UΩHC = 1 and, for all n ∈N and j1 ≤· · · ≤jn, jk ∈N, k =
1, . . . , n,
UA(ej1)∗· · · A(ejn)∗ΩHC = 2n/2 : φ(ej1) · · · φ(ejn) : .
(5.213)
For all fj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , n), we have the expansion fj = P∞
n=1 an(fj)en.
Using this expansion and (5.213) as well as limting arguments, we can prove
(5.212).
We call the unitary operator U in Theorem 5.53 the natural isomorphism
between Fb(HC) and L2( ˙R∞, dµ).
Let φF(f) (f ∈H ) be as in (5.107) with C being the complex conju-
gation on HC. In order to see what UφF(f)U −1 is like, we need a lemma:
Lemma 5.45. Let n ≥2 and f1, . . . , fn ∈H . Then the following recursion
relation holds:
: φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : = φ(f1) : φ(f2) · · · φ(fn) :
−1
2
n
X
j=2
⟨f1, fj⟩: φ(f1) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn) : .
(5.214)
Proof. Let t = (t1, . . . , tn) ∈Rn and f(t) :=: eφ(Pn
j=1 tjfj) :. Then it is
easy to see that
∂nf(0)
∂tn∂tn−1 · · · ∂t1
=: φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : .
Let g := Pn
j=2 tjfj. Then we have
f(t) =: eφ(t1f1) : : eφ(g) : e−t1⟨f1,g⟩/2.
 

328
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence
∂f(0, t2, . . . , tn)
∂t1
= φ(f1) : eφ(g) : −⟨f1, g⟩
2
: eφ(g) : .
Therefore it follows that
∂f(0)
∂tn · · · ∂t1
= φ(f1) : φ(f2) · · · φ(fn) :
−
n
X
j=2
⟨f1, fj⟩
2
: φ(f2) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn) : .
Thus (5.214) holds.
We denote the multiplication operator by the function φ(f) on
L2( ˙R∞, dµ) by the same symbol φ(f), which is self-adjoint.
Theorem 5.54. Let U be the unitary operator in Theorem 5.53. Then, for
all f ∈H , the operator equality
UφF(f)U −1 = φ(f)
(5.215)
holds.
Proof. Let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩHC (n ≥0, fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n).
Then we have by (5.214)
UA(f)∗Ψ = 2
n+1
2
: φ(f)φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) :
=
√
2φ(f)UΨ −2
n−1

n

j=1
⟨f, fj⟩: φ(f1) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn) : .
Moreover
UA(f)Ψ =

⟨f, fj⟩UA(f1)∗· · · \
A(fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩHC
= 2
n−1
2
n
X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩: φ(f1) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn) : .
Hence we obtain UφF(f)Ψ = φ(f)UΨ. Therefore UφF(f)U −1 = φ(f) on
UFb,ﬁn(HC).
Since φF(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(HC), the
operator equality (5.215) follows.
Theorem 5.54 implies the following fact:
Corollary 5.16. Let πF(f) (f ∈H ) be as in (5.107) with C being the
complex conjugation on HC and
π(f) := UπFU −1.
Then (L2( ˙R∞, dµ), DW, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈H }) is a representation of the
Heisenberg CCR over H .
 

Boson Fock Spaces
329
Let us see what π(f) is like. For each f ∈H , we introduce an operator
Df on L2( ˙R∞, dµ) by
Df :=
√
2UA(f)U −1.
(5.216)
Lemma 5.46. Let f, f1, . . . , fn ∈H , n ∈N. Then DW ⊂D(Df) and
Df1 = 0,
Df : φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : =
n
X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩: φ(f1) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn) :,
(5.217)
Df(φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)1) =
n
X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩φ(f1) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn)1.
(5.218)
Proof. We have Df1 =
√
2UA(f)ΩHC = 0. Let
Ψ := A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩHC.
Then we have
Df : φ(f1) · · · φ(fn) : = 2
1−n
2 UA(f)Ψ

j=1
⟨f, fj⟩: φ(f1) · · · [
φ(fj) · · · φ(fn) :
Thus (5.217) follows.
Using (5.215) and U −11 = ΩHC, we proceed as follows:
U −1Df(φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)1) =
√
2A(f)φF(f1) · · · φF(fn)ΩHC
=

j=1



⟨f, fj⟩φ(f1) · · · [


.
Thus (5.218) follows.
Lemma 5.47. For all polynomials P(t1, . . . , tn) of n variavles t1, . . . , tn ∈
R (n ∈N) and f, fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n, P(φ(f1), . . . , φ(fn)) ∈D(Df) and
DfP(φ(f1), . . . , φ(fn)) =

X
j=1
⟨f, fj⟩(∂jP)(φ(f1), . . . , φ(fn)),
(5.219)
where (∂jP)(t1, . . . , tn) := ∂P(t1, . . . , tn)/∂tj.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. This follows from (5.218).
It follows from (5.219) that
DenΦ = ˆ∂nΦ,
n ∈N, Φ ∈P0.
Hence Den is the partial diﬀerential operator in the variable ωn. For all
f ∈H and Φ ∈P0, we have by (5.219)
DfΦ =
X
n
⟨f, en⟩ˆ∂nΦ.
(5.220)
This means that Df is the directional derivative with the vector f.
Proposition 5.24. For all f ∈H
π(f) = −iDf + iφ(f)
on DW.
Proof. We have πF(f) = iφF(f) −
√
2iA(f) on Fb,ﬁn(H ).
Hence the
desired result follows.
As a special case of Proposition 5.24, we have
ˆπn = π(en)
on P0,
where ˆπn is deﬁned by (5.195).
Hence the representation (L2( ˙R∞, dµ),
DW, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈H }) includes the representation (L2( ˙R∞, dµ), P0,
{ˆqn, ˆπn|n ∈N}). We also note that φ(f) is a multiplication operator. Hence
(L2( ˙R∞, dµ), DW, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈H }) may be interpreted as a representa-
tion in a functional form corresponding to the Schr¨odinger representations
of CCR with ﬁnite degrees of freedom. For this reason we call it a func-
tional Schr¨odinger representation of the Heisenberg CCR over
H .
5.27
Concluding Remarks
The theory developed in Section 5.26 is in fact a special case of the theory of
Gaussian random process over a real Hilbert space. This concept is deﬁned
as follows:
Deﬁnition 5.10. Let H be a separable real Hilbert space and {φH (f)|f ∈
H } be a set of random variables on a probability space (QH , ΣH , µH )
(i.e. φH (f) : QH →R∪{±∞}, ΣH -measurable and φH (f)(q) is ﬁnite for
µH -a.e. q ∈QH ). The mapping φH : f 7→φH (f) is called a Gaussian
random process over H if the following (i)–(iii) hold:
 

Boson Fock Spaces
331
(i) (linearity) For all f, g ∈H and a, b ∈R, φH (af + bg) = aφH (f) +
bφH (g), µH -a.e.
(ii) (fullness) {φH (f)|f ∈H } is full.
(iii) (Gaussian)
R
QH eiφH (f)dν = e−∥f∥2/4, f ∈H .
Remark
5.46. Part
(iii)
in
Deﬁnition
5.10
can
be
replaced
by
R
QH eiφH (f)dν = e−λ∥f∥2 (f ∈H ) with λ > 0. But, if we deﬁne a new
random variable eφH (f) by eφH (f) := φH (f)/2
√
λ, then
R
QH eieφH (f)dν =
e−∥f∥2/4. Hence the choice of λ is not essential.
The contents of Section 5.26 shows that, for any separable real Hilbert
space H , there exists a Gaussian random process over H .
Lemmas, Propositions and Theorems concerning φ(·) in Section 5.26
hold with ( ˙R∞, Σ∞, µ) and φ(·) replaced by (QH , ΣH , µH ) and φH (·)
respectively. In particular, the boson Fock space Fb(HC) is isomorphic
to L2(QH , dµH ) in quite the same way as in the case of L2( ˙R∞, dµ) (cf.
(5.212)). The Hilbert space L2(QH , dµH ) is sometimes called the Q-space
representation of the boson Fock space Fb(HC).
Generally speaking, the integration of a function on an inﬁnite dimen-
sional space with respect to an inﬁnite dimensional measure is called a
functional integration. The integration with respect to the measure µH
on QH is a basic example of functional integrations appearing in mathe-
matical quantum ﬁeld theory.
The natural isomorphism between Fb(HC) and L2(QH , dµH ) is a fun-
damental structure of the boson Fock space Fb(HC).
This structure is
shown to be very useful in studying quantum ﬁeld models, because, under
the isomorphism, the time-zero ﬁeld φF(f) (f ∈H ) becomes a multiplica-
tion operator by the function φH (f) on QH and one can use the functional
integration with respect to µH to study functions on QH . For more de-
tails, see, e.g., [Arai (2010); Ezawa and Arai (1988); Derezi´nski and G´erard
(2013); Glimm and Jaﬀe (1987); L¨orinczi et al. (2011); Simon (1974, 1979)].

For each f ∈V , there exists an N ∈N such that f = PN

In this case, for all m > N, ⟨f, em⟩= 0. Hence, for each λ ∈u(N) and

Chapter 6
Fermion Fock Spaces
Fundamental aspects of the theory of fermion Fock spaces, which makes a basis
for construction of Fermi ﬁelds, are described.
6.1
Deﬁnitions and Basic Properties
Let K be a complex Hilbert space and, for each p ∈N, ∧p(K ) be the
p-fold anti-symmetric tensor product of K (see Subsection 2.9.4). We set
∧0(K ) := C. The inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space
Ff(K ) =
∞
M
p=0
∧p(K )
is called the fermion Fock space over K or the anti-symmetric Fock
space over K . It is obvious that Ff(K ) is a closed subspace of the full
Fock space F(K ) over K .
If K
is ﬁnite-dimensional with m = dim K , then, for all p > m,
∧p(K ) = {0} (see Remark 2.9). Hence Ff(K ) = ⊕m
p=0 ∧p (K ). Therefore
Ff(K ) is ﬁnite-dimensional with dim Ff(K ) = Pm
p=0 dim ∧p(K ) = 2m.
Hence, in this case, analysis of Ff(K ) is reduced to ﬁnite dimensional
analysis. This is a big diﬀerence from the case of boson Fock spaces.
Based on the fact mentioned in the preceding paragraph, throughout
this chapter, we assume that K is inﬁnite dimensional, unless otherwise
stated.
In the context of concrete quantum ﬁeld models, K represents the state
vector space of a fermion, called the one-particle space of a fermion or
the one-fermion space, and the Hilbert space ∧p(K ) with p ≥2 as a
closed subspace of Ff(K ) represents the state vector space consisting of p
identical fermions. For this reason, ∧p(K ) is called the p-particle space
of fermions.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let Ap be the anti-symmetrization operator on the tensor product ⊗pK
(see (2.37)). Then, by Theorem 4.2(vii), the operator
Pf(K ) :=
M∞
p=0Ap
on the full Fock space F(K ) over K is the orthogonal projection onto the
fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
The following proposition on CONS’s of Ff(K ) follows from Proposi-
tions 2.11 and 4.2.
Proposition 6.1. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of K . Then
{ΩK } ∪

∪∞
p=1{ei1 ∧· · · ∧eip|i1 < · · · < ip, ij ∈N}

is a CONS of Ff(K ).
Example 6.1. Let (X, Σ, µ) be the measure space appeared in Section
2.10 and consider the case K = L2(X, dµ). Let U as
X,p : ∧p(L2(X, dµ)) →
L2
as(Xp, dµp) be the natural isomorphism introduced in Subsection 2.10.2
(N is replaced by p). We set L2
as(X0, dµ0) := C and U as
X,0 := 1. Then, by
Theorem 4.1(iii), the operator
U as
X := ⊕∞
p=0U as
X,p
is a unitary operator from Ff(L2(X, dµ)) to ⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dµp). We call
this isomorphism the natural isomorphism between Ff(L2(X, dµ)) and
⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dµp) and write
Ff(L2(X, dµ)) ∼= ⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dµp).
The subspace
∧0(K ) := Pf(K )F0(K ) = b⊕
∞
p=0 ∧p (K ),
where F0(K ) is the ﬁnite particle subspace of the full Fock space F(K )
(see Section 4.6), is called the ﬁnite particle subspace of Ff(K ). This
subspace is dense in Ff(K ).
For a subspace D of K , we deﬁne a subspace ∧ﬁn(D) of Ff(K ) by
∧ﬁn(D) := b⊕
∞
p=0Ap(ˆ⊗
pD).
(6.1)
It follows that, if D is dense in K , then ∧ﬁn(D) is dense in Ff(K ).

6.2
Fermion Second Quantization Operators
In the same manner as in the case of second quantization operators on
a boson Fock space, one can deﬁne second quantization operators on the
fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K . Then, in the same
way as in the proof of Proposition 5.2, one can show that the operator T (p)
on ⊗pK (see (4.35)) is reduced by ∧p(K ). We denote the reduced part
by T (p)
f
:
T (p)
f
:= T (p)
∧p(K ),
p ≥2.
(6.2)
As a convention, we set T (0)
f
= 0 and T (1)
f
:= T. It follows from Theorem
1.38(iv) that T (p)
f
is closed.
Theorem 6.1. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K .
(i) The second quantization dΓ(T ) on the full Fock space F(K ) is reduced
by the fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
(ii) Let dΓf(T ) be the reduced part of dΓ(T ) to Ff(K ):
dΓf(T ) := dΓ(T )Ff(K ).
Then
dΓf(T ) = ⊕∞
p=0T (p)
f
.
(iii) dΓf(T ∗) ⊂dΓf(T )∗.
(iv) If D is a core for T , then ∧ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓf(T ).
(v) If T is self-adjoint and D ⊂H is a core for T n with some n ∈N,
then ∧ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓf(T )n.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 5.1.
The operator dΓf(T ) is called the fermion second quantization op-
erator of T .
By (ii) in Theorem 6.1,
dΓf(T )ΩK = 0,
where ΩK is the Fock vacuum in F(K ). Hence
0 ∈σp(dΓf(T )).
(6.3)
We call the vector ΩK
as an element of Ff(K ) the fermion Fock
vacuum.

6.3
Fermion Γ-operators
In this section, we consider the reduction of the Γ-operators on the full
Fock space F(K ) (see Section 4.8) to the fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
Let H be a complex Hilbert space and S be a densely deﬁned clos-
able operator from H to K . Then, in the same way as in the proof of
Proposition 5.2, one can show that, for all p ≥2,
Ap ⊗p S ⊂(⊗pS)Ap.
Hence one can deﬁne a linear operator ∧pS from ∧p(H ) to ∧p(K ) as
follows:
D(∧pS) := D(⊗pS) ∩(⊗pH ),
(∧pS)Ψ := (⊗pS)Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(∧p(S)).
Note that, in the case H = K , ∧p(K ) reduces ⊗pS and the operator
∧pS is the reduced part.
For p = 0, 1, we set ∧0S := 1, ∧1S := S.
The symbol ∧p(S) may be used instead of ∧pS: ∧p(S) = ∧pS.
The following lemma is proved in the same way as in the proof of Lemma
5.2.
Lemma 6.1. Let S be a densely deﬁned closable operator from a complex
Hilbert space H to K and Γ(S) be the Γ-operator from F(H ) to F(K )
deﬁned by (4.42). Then Pf(K )Γ(S) ⊂Γ(S)Pf(H ).
By this lemma, we can deﬁne a linear operator Γf(S) from Ff(H ) to
Ff(K ) by
D(Γf(S)) := D(Γ(S)) ∩Ff(H ),
Γf(S)Ψ := Γ(S)Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(Γf(S)).
The operator Γf(S) is called the fermion Γ-operator associated with
S.
It follows that
Γf(S) = ⊕∞
p=0 ∧p S.
We have
Γf(S)ΩK = ΩK .
Hence
1 ∈σp(Γf(S)).
(6.4)
The next theorem can be proved in quite the same manner as in the
proof of Theorem 5.5.
Theorem 6.2. Let S be a densely deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
 

Fermion Fock Spaces
341
(i) If S is unbounded, then Γf(S) is unbounded.
(ii) Γf(S∗) ⊂Γf(S)∗.
(iii) If S is a contraction operator, then Γf(S) is a contraction operator
and
Γf(S)∗= Γf(S∗).
(iv) If D is a core for S, then ∧ﬁn(D) is a core for Γf(S).
Theorem 6.3. Let H , K and X be complex Hilbert spaces.
(i) If T is self-adjoint on H , then so is Γf(T ).
(ii) If U : H →K is unitary, then so is Γf(U) : Ff(H ) →Ff(K ) and
Γf(U)−1 = Γf(U −1).
(6.5)
Moreover,
Γf(U) ∧ﬁn (H ) = ∧ﬁn(K ).
(iii) Let S ∈B(H , K ) and T ∈B(K , X ) be contraction operators.
Then,
Γf(T )Γf(S) = Γf(T S).
(iv) Let Tn, T, n ∈N be contraction operators from H to K satisfying
s- limn→∞Tn = T . Then
s- lim
n→∞Γf(Tn) = Γf(T ).
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 5.6.
The next theorem gives relations between the fermion second quantiza-
tion operator and the fermion Γ-operator:
Theorem 6.4. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K .
(i) For all t ∈R,
Γf(eitT ) = eitdΓf(T ).
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓf(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+,
Γf(e−zT ) = e−zdΓf(T ).
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.14.

Commutation Properties of Fermion Second
Quantization Operators
Proposition 6.2. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on K
such that D([S, T ]) = D(ST )∩D(T S) is dense and [S, T ] is closable. Then
∧ﬁn(D([S, T ])) ⊂D([dΓf(S), dΓf(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(D([S, T ])),
[dΓf(S), dΓf(T )]Ψ = dΓf([S, T ])Ψ.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.17.
The operator
Nf := dΓf(I)
is called the fermion number operator on Ff(K ).
Applying Proposition 6.2 to the case S = I, we obtain the following
result.
Proposition 6.3. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K . Then
∧ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([Nf, dΓf(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(D(T )),
[Nf, dΓf(T )]Ψ = 0.
With regard to strong commutativity of dΓf(T ) and dΓf(S) in the case
where T and S are self-adjoint, the following theorem holds.
Theorem 6.5. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on K . Then the self-
adjoint operators dΓf(S) and dΓf(T ) strongly commute if and only if S and
T strongly commute.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.18.
A simple application of this theorem to the case S = I gives the following
result.
Corollary 6.1. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K .
Then Nf and
dΓf(T ) strongly commute.

Spectral Properties of Fermion Second Quantization
Operators
Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K . In this section we study spectral
properties of dΓf(T ).1 By Theorems 4.2(iv) and Theorem 4.4(i), the analy-

sis of spectral properties of dΓf(T ) is essentially reduced to that of spectral
properties of T (p)
f
for all p ≥1.
6.5.1
Point spectrum of T (q)
f
For a p-tuple (λ1, . . . , λp) ⊂Rp (λj’s are not necessarily mutually diﬀerent)
and a real number λ ∈R, we deﬁne
nλ1,...,λp(λ) := #{j ∈(1, . . . , p)|λj = λ},
the number of j’s such that λj = λ.
For an eigenvalue λ ∈σp(T ), we set
d(λ) := dim ker(T −λ).
Theorem 6.6. Assume that K is separable. Let q ≥2. Then
σp(T (q)
f
) =



q
X
j=1
λj | λj ∈σp(T ), nλ1,...,λq(λj) ≤d(λj), j = 1, . . . , q


.
(6.6)
Proof. Let the set on the right hand side of (6.6) be Σ.
Let λ = Pq
j=1 λj ∈Σ. Then there exist a natural number s ≤q and a
set {µ1, · · · , µs} with µ1 < µ2 < · · · < µs such that {λj | j = 1, . . . , q} =
{µ1, . . . , µs} (i.e., µk’s are mutually diﬀerent λj’s). For each k = 1, . . . , s,
let nk := nλ1,...,λq(µk). Obviously one has n1 + · · · + ns = q and
s
X
k=1
nkµk = λ.
Since nk ≤d(µk) by the condition of Σ, there exists an ONS {ψ(r)
k |r =
1, . . . , nk} in ker(T −µk). Let
Ψ :=

ψ(1)

.
Then Ψ ∈D(T (q)
f
) with∥Ψ∥= 1 and T (q)
f
Ψ = λΨ. Hence λ ∈σp(T (q)
f
).
Thus Σ ⊂σp(T (q)
f
).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(T (q)
f
) so that there
exists a non-zero vector Φ ∈D(T (q)
f
) satisfying T (q)
f
Φ = λΦ · · · (∗).
Let Hp(T ) be as in (3.53) with A = T . Then, by Theorem 3.13(i),
Hp(T (q)) = ⊗qHp(T ).
 

344
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence
AqHp(T (q)) = ∧qHp(T ).
Therefore
Hp(T (q)
f
) = ∧qHp(T ).
(6.7)
Let {ψk}k be a CONS of Hp(T ) consisting of eigenvectors of T such
that T ψk = λkψk with λk ∈σp(T ). Then, by Proposition 2.11, the set
Eq := {Ψk1,...,kq := ψk1 ∧· · · ∧ψkq|k1 < . . . < kq, }
(6.8)
is a CONS of ∧q(Hp(T )). Hence, by (6.7), Eq is a CONS of Hp(T (q)
f
).
By taking the inner product of (∗) with Ψk1,...,kq, we have


q
X
j=1
λkj −λ


Ψk1,...,kq, Φ

= 0.
Since Φ ̸= 0 and {Ψk1,...,kq|k1 < · · · < kq} is a CONS of Hp(T (q)
f
) as shown
above, there exists a set {k1, . . . , kq} such that

Ψk1,...,kq, Φ

̸= 0. Hence,
for such a set {k1, . . . , kq}, λ = Pq
j=1 λkj. It follows from Proposition 2.10
that nλk1 ,...,λkq (λkj) ≤d(λkj) for all j = 1, . . . , q. Therefore λ ∈Σ. Thus
σp(T (q)
f
) ⊂Σ.
6.5.2
Point spectrum of ∧qT
We next consider the point spectrum of ∧qT .
Theorem 6.7. Assume that K is separable. Let q ≥2. Then
σp(∧qT ) =


j=1
λj|λj ∈σp(T ), nλ1,...,λq(λj) ≤d(λj), j = 1, . . . , q

(6.9)
Proof. This is proved in quite the same way as in Theorem 6.6.
6.5.3
Spectrum of T (p)

We need some preliminaries. Let

the spectral measure E⊗
A1,...,AN deﬁned by (3.34) with N = p, Hj = K and
Aj = T (j = 1, . . . , N). Namely Ep
T is the p-dimensional spectral measure
such that
Ep
T (B1 × · · · × Bp) = ET (B1) ⊗· · · ⊗ET (BN),
Bj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , p.
By (3.42), we have

The spectral measure Ep

By Theorem 1.38(ix), we have

B ∈B1.
Lemma 6.2. Let K be separable. Then there exists a CONS {Ψn}∞

supp mΨn ⊂Θ(p)(T ).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let
Hess(T ) := RanET (σess(T )),
Hd(T ) := RanET (σd(T )).
Then, by (1.20), we have
K = Hess(T ) ⊕Hd(T ).
Here we consider only the case where σess(T ) ̸= ∅and σd(T ) ̸= ∅. The
other cases are easier to treat in a similar manner.
Let {ψk}∞
k=1 be a CONS of Hess(T ) and {φℓ}ℓbe a CONS of Hd(T )
such that T φℓ= κℓφℓwith κℓ∈σd(T ). Then, by Proposition 2.11, the set
{ψk1 ∧· · ·∧ψkN ∧φℓ1 ∧· · ·∧φℓM |k1 < · · · < kN, ℓ1 < · · · < ℓM, N +M = p}
is a CONS of ∧p(K ).
Let Ψ := ψk1 ∧· · · ∧ψkN ∧φℓ1 ∧· · · ∧φℓM be ﬁxed (k1 < · · · < kN, ℓ1 <
· · · < ℓM, N + M = p). For notational simplicity, we set ηi := ψki, i =
1, . . . , N, and ηN+k := φℓk, k = 1, . . . , M. We set
B = σess(T ) ∪{κℓk}M
k=1.
Then
ET (B)ηj = ηj.
(6.10)
Let
JΘ :=

λj ∈Θ(p)(T )}


.
Let (λ1, . . . , λp) ∈Bp.
Then λj ∈σ(T ), j = 1, . . . , p.
If λj ∈σd(T ),
then λj = κℓk for some k ∈{1, . . . , M}.
Since Ψ ̸= 0, it follows that
nλ1,...,λp(λj) ≤d(λj). Therefore (λ1, . . . , λp) ∈JΘ. Thus Bp ⊂JΘ. Using
(6.10), one can easily see that Ep
T (Bp)Ψ = Ψ.
Hence Ep
T (JΘ)Ψ = Ψ.
Therefore
ET (p)
f
(Θ(p)(T ))Ψ = ApET (p)(Θ(p)(T ))ApΨ
= ET (p)(Θ(p)(T ))Ψ = Ep
T (JΘ)Ψ = Ψ.
This implies that supp mΨ ⊂Θ(p)(T ). Since the set
{(k1, . . . , kN, ℓ1, . . . , ℓM)|k1 < · · · < kN, ℓ1 < · · · < ℓM, N + M = p}
is countably inﬁnite, the statement of the lemma follows.

We can now identify the spectrum of T (p)
f
.
Theorem 6.8. Assume that K is separable. Then, for all p ≥2, σ(T (p)
f
) =
Θ(p)(T ).
Proof. We ﬁrst show that Θ(p)(T ) ⊂σ(T (p)
f
). Let λ = Pp
j=1 λj ∈Θ(p)(T )
and, for each number ε > 0, Ij,ε := (λj −ε, λj + ε).
By Proposition
1.26, RanET (Ij,ε) ̸= {0}, j = 1, . . . , p.
Recall that, if λj ∈σess(T ),
then dim RanET (Ij,ε) = ∞(Proposition 1.29(ii)).
If λj ∈σd(T ), then
RanET (Ij,ε) = ker(T −λj) for all suﬃciently small ε. Hence there exists
a constant δ > 0 such that, for all ε ∈(0, δ), Ij,ε ∩Ik,ε = ∅if λj ̸= λk,
and RanET (Ij,ε) = ker(T −λj) if λj ∈σd(T ). It follows that, for all (j, k)
satisfying λj ̸= λk, RanET (Ij,ε) ⊥RanET (Ik,ε).
Hence there exists an
ONS {ψj}p
j=1 in K such that ψj ∈RanET (Ij,ε), j = 1, . . . , p, where the
condition “nλ1,...,λp(λj) ≤d(λj) if λj ∈σd(T )” is used. The vector
Ψ := ψ1 ∧ψ2 ∧· · · ∧ψp
is a unit vector in D(T (p)
f
) and
(T (p)
f
−λ)Ψ =
p
X
j=1
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧(T −λj)ψj ∧· · · ∧ψp.
By the functional calculus, we have ∥(T −λj)ψj∥< ε. Hence
∥(T (p)

∥ψ1 ∧· · · ∧(T −λj)ψj ∧· · · ∧ψn∥

p
X
j=1
∥(T −λj)ψj∥≤p

p! ε.
This implies that λ ∈σ(T (p)
f
). Hence Θ(p)(T ) ⊂σ(T (p)
f
). Thus Θ(p)(T ) ⊂
σ(T (p)
f
).
To
prove
the
converse
inclusion
relation,
let
{Ψn}n
be
the
CONS in Lemma 6.2.
Then ∧p(K )
=
span {Ψn}n.
Note that
ET (p)
f
(supp mΨn)Ψn = Ψn (see Problem 8 in Chapter 1).
Hence, by
Lemma 6.2, ET (p)
f
(Θ(p)(T ))Ψn = Ψn for all n ∈N. Hence span {Ψn}n ⊂
RanET (p)
f
(Θ(p)(T )). Therefore RanET (p)
f
(Θ(p)(T )) = ∧p(K ), implying that
ET (p)

Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 4.2(iv), Theorem 6.6 and (6.3).
(ii) This follows from Theorem 4.4(i), Theorem 6.8 and (6.3), where
we have used the fact that, for sets Sn (n ∈N) in a topological space,
∪∞
n=1Sn = ∪∞
n=1Sn.
(iii) This follows from Theorem 4.2(iv), Theorem 6.7 and (6.4).
(iv) This follows from Theorem 4.2(iv), Theorem 6.9 and (6.4).

Fermion Annihilation and Creation Operators
As in the case of boson Fock spaces, one has, in a natural way, restrictions
of the annihilation and creation operators on the full Fock space Ff(K )
to the fermion Fock space Ff(K ) and is led to deﬁne an operator B(u)
(u ∈K ) on Ff(K ) as follows:
D(B(u)) :=
(
Ψ ∈Ff(K )|
∞
X
p=0
∥
p
p + 1Apcp,+(u)∗Ψ(p+1)∥2 < ∞
)
,
(6.11)
(B(u)Ψ)(p) :=
p
p + 1cp,+(u)∗Ψ(p+1),
p ≥0, Ψ ∈D(B(u)),
(6.12)
where Ap is the anti-symmetrization operator on ⊗pK and cp,+(u) is de-
ﬁned by (4.57) with H = K and n = p. By an application of Theorem
4.3, B(u) is a densely deﬁned closed operator. It follows that
B(u)ΩK = 0,
u ∈K .
(6.13)
The explicit form of the adjoint B(u)∗is given in the following propo-
sition:
Proposition 6.4. Let u ∈K . Then
D(B(u)∗) =
(
Ψ = {Ψ(p)}∞
p=0 ∈Ff(K )

X
p=1
∥√pAp(u ⊗Ψ(p−1))∥2 < ∞

(6.14)
(B(u)∗Ψ)(0) = 0,
(6.15)
(B(u)∗Ψ)(p) = √pAp(u ⊗Ψ(p−1)),
p ≥1, Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗).
(6.16)
Proof. For all p ≥1, Bp(u) := √pAp−1cp−1,+(u)∗Ap is a bounded operator
from ∧pK to ∧p−1K . Hence, Bp(u)∗= √pApcp−1,+(u)Ap−1. In quite the
same way as in the proof of Theorem 4.3(ii) (see also Remark 4.3), one
can show that Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗) if and only P∞
p=1 ∥Bp(u)∗Ψ(p−1)∥2 < ∞and,
in that case, (B(u)∗Ψ)(p) = Bp(u)∗Ψ(p−1), p ≥1.
On the other hand,
Bp(u)∗Ψ(p−1) = √pAp(u ⊗Ψ(p−1)). Thus the desired result follows.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Remark 6.1. One can ﬁrst deﬁne B(u)∗by (6.14)–(6.16) and then B(u)
by its adjoint. This may be easier as deﬁnition.
The operators B(u) and B(u)∗are called the fermion annihilation
operator and the fermion creation operator with test vector u respec-
tively.
For a special class of vectors in Ff(K ), one can ﬁnd an explicit form
of operation of B(u):
Proposition 6.5. Let p ∈N and ψj ∈K , j = 1, . . . , p. Let Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(K )
be of the form: Ψ(p) := Ap(⊗p
j=1ψj) and Ψ(q) = 0 for q ̸= p.
Then,
(B(u)Ψ)(q) = 0 for q ̸= p −1 and
(B(u)Ψ)(p−1) =
1
√p
p
X
j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨u, ψj⟩Ap−1(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗c
ψj ⊗· · · ⊗ψp),
(6.17)
where c
ψj indicates the omission of c
ψj (in the case p = 1, Ap−1(· · · ) := 1).
Proof. It is obvious that (B(u)Ψ)(q) = 0 for q ̸= p −1. By (4.58), we have
cp−1,+(u)∗Ψ(p) = 1
p!

j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨f, ψj⟩Ap−1(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗c
ψj ⊗· · · ⊗ψp).
By this fact and (6.12), we obtain (6.17).
Proposition 6.6. Let n ∈N and uj ∈K , j = 1, . . . , n. Then, ΩK ∈
D(B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗) and, for all p ≥1,
(B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK )(p) = δnp
p
p!Ap(u1 ⊗· · · ⊗up)
= δnpu1 ∧· · · ∧up.
(6.18)
Proof. We need only to apply (6.16) repeatedly.
It follows from Proposition 6.6 that, for every subspace D ⊂K ,
∧ﬁn(D) = span {ΩK , B(u1)∗· · · B(up)∗ΩK |p ≥1, uj ∈D, j = 1, · · · , p}.
(6.19)
Moreover, we have the following fact:
Theorem 6.11. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of K . Then
{ΩK , B(ei1)∗· · · B(eip)∗ΩK | p ≥1, i1 < . . . < ip, ij ∈N, j = 1, . . . , p}
is a CONS of Ff(K ).
 

Fermion Fock Spaces

Proof. This follows from (6.18) and Proposition 6.1.
For each u ∈K , we denote by B(u)# either B(u) or B(u)∗.
Example 6.2. We consider the case where K
= L2(X, dµ) (Exam-
ple 5.2).
For notational simplicity, we use the natural identiﬁcation
of Ψ(p) ∈∧pL2(X, dµ) with U as
X,pΨ(p) ∈L2
as(Xp, dµp) (see Subsection
2.10.2) and of B(u)# with U as
X B(u)#(U as
X )−1 (see Example 6.1).
Let
u ∈L2(X, dµ) and Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗), Φ ∈Ff(L2(X, dµ)). Then, using (6.16)
and Ap+1Φ(p+1) = Φ(p+1), we have
D
Φ(p+1), (B(u)∗Ψ)(p+1)E
=

where we have used Fubini’s theorem to exchange the order of integrations.
By this fact, we see that Φ is in D(B(u)) if and only if

dµ(x1) · · · dµ(xp) < ∞
and, in that case, we have for all Φ ∈D(B(u)) and p ≥0
(B(u)Φ)(p)(x1, . . . , xp) =
p
p + 1
Z
X
u(x)∗Φ(p+1)(x, x1, . . . , xp)dµ(x).
Strictly speaking, the left hand side is (U as
X B(u)(U as
X )−1Φ)(p)(x1, . . . , xp)
with Φ ∈⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dµp).
As for the creation operator B(u)∗, by (6.16), one can show that, for all
Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗) and p ≥1
(B(u)∗Ψ)(p)(x1, . . . , xp) =
√p
p!
X
σ∈Sp
u(xσ(1))Ψ(p−1)(xσ(2), . . . , xσ(p)).

X
j=1
(−1)j−1u(xj)Ψ(p−1)(x1, . . . , ˆxj, . . . , xp).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By virtue of Example 6.2, one can prove the following theorem in the
same way as in the proof of Theorem 5.21:
Theorem 6.12. Assume that K be separable. Let T be a non-negative
self-adjoint operator on K and {en}∞
n=1 ⊂D(T 1/2) be a CONS of K .
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓf(T )1/2), P∞
n=1 ∥B(T 1/2en)Ψ∥2 < ∞and
∥dΓf(T )1/2Ψ∥2 =

In particular, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

∥B(en)Ψ∥2.
6.7
Canonical Anti-commutation Relations
For two linear operators A and B acting in a Hilbert space X , one can
deﬁne a linear operator {A, B} on X by
{A, B} := AB + BA.
By the deﬁnition of the sum of two linear operators, D({A, B}) = D(AB)∩
D(BA). The operator {A, B} is called the anti-commutator of A and B.
Theorem 6.13. For every u ∈K , B(u) and B(u)∗are everywhere deﬁned
bounded operator on Ff(K ) with
∥B(u)∥= ∥B(u)∗∥= ∥u∥.
(6.20)
Moreover, the following anti-commutation relations hold:
{B(u), B(v)∗} = ⟨u, v⟩,
(6.21)
{B(u), B(v)} = 0,
{B(u)∗, B(v)∗} = 0,
u, v ∈K .
(6.22)
Proof. Let p ∈N be ﬁxed arbitrarily and Ψp ∈Ff(K ) be a vector of the
following form:
Ψ(p)
p
= Ap(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψp),
Ψ(q)
p
= 0,
q ̸= p,

where ψj ∈K , j = 1, . . . , p. Then

j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨u, ψj⟩

q ̸= p,
(B(v)∗B(u)Ψp)(p)
=

j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨u, ψj⟩Ap(v ⊗ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψj−1 ⊗ψj+1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψp),
(B(v)∗B(u)Ψp)(q) = 0,
q ̸= p.
Hence {B(u), B(v)∗}Ψp = ⟨u, v⟩Ψp.
Using (6.13), one can easily show that
{B(u), B(v)∗}ΩK = ⟨u, v⟩ΩK .
Therefore it follows that
{B(u), B(v)∗}Ψ = ⟨u, v⟩Ψ,
Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(K ).
(6.23)
Hence
⟨B(u)∗Ψ, B(v)∗Ψ⟩+ ⟨B(v)Ψ, B(u)Ψ⟩= ⟨u, v⟩∥Ψ∥2.
In particular, taking u = v, we obtain
∥B(u)∗Ψ∥+ ∥B(u)Ψ∥2 = ∥u∥2∥Ψ∥2.
(6.24)
Hence ∥B(u)Ψ∥≤∥u∥∥Ψ∥, ∥B(u)∗Ψ∥≤∥u∥∥Ψ∥.
This shows that
B(u)0 := B(u) ↾∧ﬁn(K ) and (B(u)∗)0 := B(u)∗↾∧ﬁn(K ) are bounded
with ∥B(u)0∥≤∥u∥, ∥(B(u)∗)0∥≤∥u∥. Since B(u) and B(u)∗are closed
and ∧ﬁn(K ) is dense in Ff(K ), it follows that B(u) and B(u)∗are bounded
with D(B(u)) = D(B(u)∗) = Ff(K ) and ∥B(u)#∥≤∥u∥· · ·(∗). Taking
Ψ = ΩK in (6.24) and using (6.13) , we have ∥B(u)∗ΩK ∥= ∥u∥. Hence
∥B(u)∗∥≥∥u∥. By this fact and (∗), we have ∥B(u)∗∥= ∥u∥. Thus we
obtain (6.20) (recall that, in general, for all B ∈B(H , K ), ∥B∗∥= ∥B∥).
By the boundedness of B(u) and B(u)∗just shown and the density
of ∧ﬁn(K ) in Ff(K ), (6.23) extends to all Ψ ∈Ff(K ). Thus operator
equality (6.21) holds. Similarly one can prove (6.22).
Anti-commutation relations (6.21) and (6.22) are called the canonical
anti-commutation relations (CAR) over K .
 

354
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Putting u = v in (6.22), we have
B(u)2 = 0,
B(u)∗2 = 0,
u ∈K .
(6.25)
Hence B(u) and B(u)∗are nilpotent operators.
As a corollary to Theorem 6.13, one obtains an important formula on
the operation of B(u):
Corollary 6.2. Let n ∈N and u, u1, . . . , un ∈K . Then
B(u)B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩH
=
n
X
j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨u, uj⟩B(u1)∗· · ·
jth
⌣
\
B(uj)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK ,
(6.26)
where \
B(uj)∗indicates the omission of B(uj)∗.
Proof. By (6.21), we have
B(u)B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩH
= ({B(u), B(u1)∗} −B(u1)∗B(u)) B(u2)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK .
= ⟨u, u1⟩B(u2)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK
+ (−1)B(u1)∗B(u)B(u2)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK .
Iterating this repeatedly and using (6.13), we obtain (6.26).
6.8
Spectra of B(u)#
Let us identify the spectra of B(u)#. This is done by noting (6.25) and the
following lemma.
Lemma 6.3. Let A be an everywhere deﬁned bounded linear operator on a
Hilbert space H such that A2 = 0. Then σ(A) = σp(A) = {0}. Moreover,
dim ker A ≥dim Ran(A).
Proof. The case A = 0 is trivial. Hence we consider the case A ̸= 0. Let
λ ∈σp(A). Then there is a non-zero vector ψ ∈H such that Aψ = λψ.
By A2 = 0, 0 = λAψ = λ2ψ. Hence λ = 0. Therefore σp(A) ⊂{0}. Since
A ̸= 0, there is a non-zero vector φ ∈H such that Aφ ̸= 0. We have
A(Aφ) = 0. Hence Aφ is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue 0. Thus
σp(A) = {0}.
The proof just made shows that ker A ⊃RanA.
Hence
dim ker A ≥dim RanA.
 

Fermion Fock Spaces
355
To prove σ(A) = {0}, it is suﬃcient to show that C \ {0} ⊂ρ(A) · · · (∗).
Let z ∈C \ {0} and ψ ∈ker(A −z). Then (A −z)ψ = 0 · · · (∗∗). Hence
A(A −z)ψ = 0, which implies that zAψ = 0 and hence Aψ = 0. Hence, by
(∗∗) again, zψ = 0. Hence ψ = 0. Therefore ker(A −z) = {0}, implying
that A −z is injective. To show that A −z is surjective, let φ ∈H and
deﬁne η := −(A + z)φ/z2. Then it is easy to see that (A −z)η = φ. Hence
A −z is surjective. Thus A −z is bijective and hence z ∈ρ(A). Therefore
(∗) holds.
Theorem 6.14. For all u ∈K ,
σ(B(u)#) = σp(B(u)#) = {0}.
(6.27)
If K is inﬁnite dimensional, then the multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 of B(u)#
is inﬁnite.
Proof. One can apply Lemma 6.3 to the case A = B(u)# to conclude
(6.27).
If K is inﬁnite dimensional, then {u}⊥is inﬁnite dimensional.
Using the CAR of B(·)# and (6.13), one can easily show that, for all n ∈N
and u1, . . . , un ∈{u}⊥,
B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK ∈ker B(u), B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗B(u)∗ΩK ∈ker B(u)∗.
Hence dim ker B(u)# = ∞.
Another proof of Theorem 6.14 with a more detailed structural analysis
is given in Example 6.3 below.
6.9
Characterization of the Fermion Fock Vacuum
As we have seen, for all u ∈K , B(u) vanishes the fermion Fock vacuum
ΩK (see (6.13)). In fact, the converse is true:
Theorem 6.15. Let D be a dense subspace of K and Ψ ∈Ff(K ) be a
vector such that, for all u ∈D, B(u)Ψ = 0. Then there exists a constant
α ∈C such that Ψ = αΩK .
Proof. For all Φ ∈Ff(K ), we have
0 = ⟨Φ, B(u)Ψ⟩= ⟨B(u)∗Φ, Ψ⟩.
Let Φ ∈∧p(K ) (p ≥0). Then

√p + 1Ap+1(u ⊗Φ), Ψ(p+1)
= 0. The
subspace algebraically spanned by {Ap+1(u ⊗Φ)|u ∈D, Φ ∈∧p(K )} is
dense in ∧p+1(K ). Hence Ψ(p+1) = 0. Since p ≥0 is arbitrary, it follows
that Ψ = {Ψ(0), 0, 0, . . .} = αΩK with α := Ψ(0).
See also Problems 1 and 2 for further developments of Theorem 6.15.

Operators
Theorem 6.16. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K .
(i) For every u ∈D(T ), B(u)∗leaves D(dΓf(T )) invariant and
[dΓf(T ), B(u)∗] = B(T u)∗
on D(dΓf(T )).
(6.28)
(ii) For every u ∈D(T ∗), B(u) leaves dΓf(T ) invariant and
[dΓf(T ), B(u)] = −B(T ∗u)
on D(dΓf(T )).
(6.29)
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(D(T )).
Then Ψ ∈D(dΓf(T )) and B(u)∗Ψ ∈
D(dΓf(T )). Moreover,
(dΓf(T )B(u)∗Ψ)(p) = √pAp(T u ⊗Ψ(p−1)) + √pAp(u ⊗(dΓfΨ)p−1),
(B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψ)(p) = √pAp(u ⊗(dΓf(T )Ψ)(p−1)).
Hence
([dΓf(T ), B(u)∗]Ψ)(p) = √pAp(T u ⊗Ψ(p−1)) = (B(T u)∗Ψ)(p).
Therefore
[dΓf(T ), B(u)∗]Ψ = B(T u)∗Ψ.
Let Ψ ∈D(dΓf(T )). Since ∧ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓf(T ), there ex-
ists a sequence {Ψn}n in ∧ﬁn(D(T )) such that Ψn →Ψ, dΓf(T )Ψn →
dΓf(T )Ψ (n →∞). By the result obtained above, we have
dΓf(T )B(u)∗Ψn = B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψn + B(T u)∗Ψn.
By the boundedness of B(·)∗, the right hand side of this equation con-
verges to B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψ + B(T u)∗Ψ as n →∞. Hence, by the closedness
of dΓf(T ), B(u)∗Ψ ∈D(dΓf(T )) and dΓf(T )B(u)∗Ψ = B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψ +
B(T u)∗Ψ.
Thus, B(u)∗leaves D(dΓf(T )) invariant and (6.28) holds on
D(dΓf(T )).
(ii) Let u ∈D(T ∗). Then, by considering the adjoint of (6.28) with T
replaced by T ∗, we have
[dΓf(T ), B(u)] = −B(T ∗u)
on ∧ﬁn(D(T )).
Then, by a limiting argument similar to that in (i), one can see that B(u)
leaves D(dΓf(T )) invariant and (6.29) holds.

Theorem 6.17. Let W be a unitary operator on K . Then
Γf(W)B(u)#Γf(W)−1 = B(Wu)#,
u ∈K .
(6.30)
Proof. Let Ψ = B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK (n ≥0, uj ∈K , j = 1, . . . , n).
Then it is easy to see that Γf(W)B(u)∗Ψ = B(Wu)∗Γf(W)Ψ.
Since
the subspace algebraically spanned by vectors of the form Ψ is dense in
Ff(K ) and Γf(W) and B(u)∗are bounded, it follows that Γf(W)B(u)∗=
B(Wu)∗Γf(W). Hence (6.30) with B(u)# = B(u)∗holds. Similarly (or by
taking the adjoint of (6.30) with B(u)# = B(u)∗), we obtain (6.30) with
B(u)# = B(u).
By this theorem and Theorem 6.4(i), we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 6.18. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K . Then, for all t ∈R
and u ∈K ,
eitdΓf(T )B(u)#e−itdΓf(T ) = B(eitT u)#,
Corollary 6.3. For all u ∈K ,
eiπNfB(u)#e−iπNf = −B(u)#.
We introduce a bounded self-adjoint operator (−1)Nf on Ff(K ) by
((−1)NfΨ)(p) := (−1)pΨ(p),
Ψ ∈Ff(K ), p ≥0.
By functional calculus, we have
(−1)Nf = eiπNf = e−iπNf.
Corollary 6.3 is rephrased as the anti-commutativity of (−1)Nf and B(u)#:
{(−1)Nf, B(u)#} = 0.
(6.31)
As in the case of boson second quantization operators (see Theorem
5.20), a fermion second quantization operator also has a representation in
terms of B(·)#:

deﬁned closable operator from K to L .
(i) Let S ∈B(L , K ) and ST be closable. Let {en|n ∈N} ⊂D(T ∗) be a

operator-valued functions B(eitT u) and B(eitT u)∗of t ∈R. In this section
we consider diﬀerentiability of them.
To state a theorem on this aspect, we recall a deﬁnition of diﬀerentiabil-
ity of an operator-valued function on an interval I of R. Let H be a Hilbert
space and t0 ∈I. Then an operator-valued function T : I →B(H ); I ∋
t 7→T (t) ∈B(H ) is said to be uniformly diﬀerentiable at t = t0 if
the uniform limit u- limt→t0(T (t) −T (t0))/(t −t0) ∈B(H ) exists. If T is
uniformly diﬀerentiable at any point t in I, then T is said to be uniformly
diﬀerentiable on I. In this case, we deﬁne
dT (t)
dt
:= u- lim
ε→0
T (t + ε) −T (t)
ε
∈B(H )
and call it the uniform derivative of T .
If dT/dt is uniformly diﬀerentiable on I, then T is said to be twice
uniformly diﬀerentiable on I. In this case, the second uniform derivative is
deﬁned by
d2T (t)
dt2
:= dT ′(t)
dt
,
T ′(t) := dT (t)
dt
.
In a similar manner, for any natural number n ≥3, one can deﬁne n times
uniform diﬀerentiability of T and the nth uniform derivative T (n)(t) =
dnT (t)/dtn inductively:
dnT (t)
dtn
:= dT (n−1)(t)
dt
.

Theorem 6.20. Let u ∈D(T n) and n ∈N. Then B(eitT u)# is n times
uniformly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R with uniform derivative
dnB(eitT u)#
dtn
= B(ineitT T nu)#.
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case n = 1. Let t ∈R, ε ∈R \ {0}, u ∈D(T )
and
Aε := B(ei(t+ε)T u)# −B(eitT u)#
ε
−B(ieitT T u)#.
Then we have Aε = B(eitT uε)# with
uε := eiεT u −u
ε
−iT u.
Hence ∥Aε∥= ∥eitT uε∥= ∥uε∥. By Theorem 1.21(iii), limε→∥uε∥= 0.
Thus the present theorem with n = 1 holds. Similarly, by induction in n,
one can prove the theorem with any n.
6.12
The Fermion Fock Space over a Direct Sum Hilbert
Space
Let K1 and K2 be complex Hilbert spaces. Then one can consider the
fermion Fock space Ff(K1⊕K2) over the direct sum Hilbert space K1⊕K2.
As in the boson Fock space case, there exists a natural isomorphism between
Ff(K1 ⊕K2) and Ff(K1) ⊗Ff(K2) if K1 and K2 are separable. To be
deﬁnite, for i = 1, 2, we denote by BKi(u) the annihilation operator on
Ff(Ki) with test vector u ∈Ki. On the other hand, we simply denote by
B(u, v) the annihilation operator on Ff(K1 ⊕K2) with test vector (u, v) ∈
K1 ⊕K2.
In what follows, we use the convention that, for algebraic objects Xi
(i ∈N), X1 · · · Xp := 1 if p = 0.
Theorem 6.21. Suppose that K1 and K2 are separable. Then there exists
a unique unitary operator U : Ff(K1 ⊕K2) →Ff(K1)⊗Ff(K2) such that
UΩK1⊕K2 = ΩK1 ⊗ΩK2
(6.36)
and, for all n, m ∈{0} ∪N and ui ∈K1, vj ∈K2 (i = 1, . . . , n, j =
1, . . . , m),
UB(u1, 0)∗· · · B(un, 0)∗B(0, v1)∗· · · B(0, vm)∗ΩK1⊕K2
(6.37)
= BK1(u1)∗· · · BK1(un)∗ΩK1 ⊗BK2(v1)∗· · · BK2(vm)∗ΩK2 (6.38)
Moreover, the following hold:

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(i) For all u ∈K1, v ∈K2,
UB(u, v)#U −1 = BK1(u)# ⊗I + (−1)Nf ⊗BK2(v)#.
(6.39)
(ii) Let T1 and T2 be self-adjoint operators on K1 and K2 respectively.
Then
UdΓf(T1 ⊕T2)U −1 = dΓf(T1) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(T2).
(iii) Let A1 and A2 be contraction operators on K1 and K2 respectively.
Then
UΓ(A1 ⊕A2)U −1 = Γ(A1) ⊗Γ(A2).
Proof. Let {en}∞
n=1 and {fn}∞
n=1 be CONS’s of K1 and K2 respectively.
Then, by Theorem 6.11,
{B(ei1)∗· · · B(eip)∗ΩK1 ⊗B(fj1)∗· · · B(fjq)∗ΩK2| p, q ≥0, i1 < . . . < ip,
j1 < . . . < jq, ik, jℓ∈N, k = 1, . . . , p, ℓ= 1, . . . , q}
is a CONS of Ff(K1)⊗Ff(K2). The set {(en, 0), (0, fn)| n ∈N} is a CONS
of K1 ⊕K2. Hence, by Theorem 6.11 again,
{B(ei1, 0)∗· · · B(eip, 0)∗B(0, fj1)∗· · · B(0, fjq)∗ΩK1⊕K2| p, q ≥0,
i1 < . . . < ip, j1 < . . . < jq, ik, jℓ∈N, k = 1, . . . , p, ℓ= 1, . . . , q}
is a CONS of Ff(K1 ⊕K2). Hence, by the isomorphism theorem, there
exists a unique unitary operator U from Ff(K1 ⊕K2) to Ff(K1)⊗Ff(K2)
such that, for all p, q ≥0 and i1 < . . . < ip, j1 < . . . < jq, ik, jℓ∈N,
UB(ei1, 0)∗· · · B(eip, 0)∗B(0, fj1)∗· · · B(0, fjq)∗ΩK1⊕K2
= B(ei1)∗· · · B(eip)∗ΩK1 ⊗B(fj1)∗· · · B(fjq)∗ΩK2.
Hence, in particular, (6.36) holds. It is easy to see that, for each u ∈K1,
B(u)∗=
∞
X
n=1
⟨en, u⟩B(en)∗
in the sense of operator norm (Problem 7(ii)). Using this fact, one can
prove (6.38).
(i) Let Ψ = B(u1, 0)∗· · · B(un, 0)∗B(0, v1)∗· · · B(0, vm)∗ΩK1⊕K2. Then
B(u, v)∗Ψ = B(u, 0)∗Ψ + B(0, v)∗Ψ = B(u, 0)∗Ψ + (−1)nΨ′,
where Ψ′ := B(u1, 0)∗· · · B(un, 0)∗B(0, v)∗B(0, v1)∗· · · B(0, vm)∗ΩK1⊕K2.
Hence, by the preceding result, we have
UB(u, v)∗Ψ = (B(u)∗⊗I)UΨ + (−1)n(I ⊗B(v)∗)UΨ
= (B(u)∗⊗I)UΨ + ((−1)Nf ⊗B(v)∗)UΨ.
 

Fermion Fock Spaces
361
Since the subspace algebraically spanned by vectors of the form Ψ is dense
in Ff(K1 ⊕K2) and B(u, v)∗, B(u)∗⊗I and (−1)Nf ⊗B(v)∗are bounded,
it follows that
UB(u, v)∗= (B(u)∗⊗I)U + ((−1)Nf ⊗B(v)∗)U.
Thus (6.39) with # = ∗holds. Taking the adjoint of the operator equality
just obtained, we have (6.39) with # = ∅.
Parts (ii) and (iii) can be proved in the same way as in the boson Fock
space case.
Remark 6.2. Note that the operator (−1)Nf appears on the right hand
side of (6.39). This is a big diﬀerence from the case of boson Fock spaces
(see (5.144)).
Remark 6.3. Theorem 6.21 can be extended to the case where K1 ⊕K2 is
replaced by the N direct sum ⊕N
j=1Kj of Hilbert spaces K1, . . . , KN with
N ≥3. The reader is asked to ﬁll in the details of this extension (Problem
9).
Example 6.3 (spectra of B(u)#). Let K be a complex Hilbert space
and e1 ∈K be a unit vector arbitrarily chosen. Let K1 := {αe1|α ∈C}
and K2 := K ⊥
1
= {u ∈K | ⟨u, e1⟩= 0}. Then K = {αe1 + v|α ∈C, v ∈
K2} ∼= K1 ⊕K2. By Theorem 6.21, there exists a unique unitary operator
U : Ff(K ) →Ff(K1) ⊗Ff(K2) such that
UBK (e1)U −1 = BK1(e1) ⊗I,
UBK (e1)∗U −1 = BK1(e1)∗⊗I.
Hence, by Theorems 3.3 and 3.4,
σ(BK (e1)#) = σ(BK1(e1)#),
σp(BK (e1)#) = σp(BK1(e1)#).
The spectra BK1(e1)# can be found as follows. Since dim K1 = 1, it
follows that
Ff(K1) = C ⊕K1 ∼= C ⊕C = C2,
where we use the isomorphism K1 →C given by the correspondence αe1 7→
α, α ∈C. Then, under this isomorphism, BK1(e1) is unitarily equivalent
to the 2 × 2 matrix
b :=
 0 1
0 0

.
Hence BK1(e1)∗is unitarily equivalent to
b∗=
0 0
1 0

.
 

362
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is easy to see that
σ(b) = σp(b) = {0},
σ(b∗) = σp(b∗) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 1. Hence
σ(BK1(e1)#) = σp(BK1(e1)#) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 1. Thus
σ(BK (e1)#) = σp(BK (e1)#) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is dim Ff(K2) = 2dim K −1.
For each u ∈K \ {0}, we have BK (u)# = ∥u∥BK (e1)# with e1 :=
u/∥u∥. Thus
σ(BK (u)#) = σp(BK (u)#) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 2dim K −1.
A related problem is given in Problem 8(i).
6.13
Representations of CAR
In concluding this chapter, we brieﬂy mention an important concept related
to the theory of fermion Fock spaces.
Deﬁnition 6.1. Let F be a complex Hilbert space and W be a complex
inner product space. Let
A(W ) := {ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈W }
be a subset of B(F).
(1) The pair (F, A(W )) is called a representation of the CAR over W
if the following (a) and (b) hold:
(a) (anti-lineality) For all f, g ∈W and α, β ∈C, ψ(αf + βg) =
α∗ψ(f) + β∗ψ(g).
(b) (CAR) For all f, g ∈W ,
{ψ(f), ψ(g)} = 0,
{ψ(f), ψ(g)∗} = ⟨f, g⟩W ,
(2) The representation (F, A(W )) is said to be irreducible if A(W ) is
irreducible (see Deﬁnition 5.2(iii)).
(3) Let (F′, A′(W )) with A′(W ) := {ψ′(f), ψ′(f)∗|f ∈W }) be another
representation of the CAR over W .
Then the two representations
(F′, A′(W )) and (F, A(W )) are said to be equivalent if there exists a uni-
tary operator U : F →F′ such that, for all f ∈W , ψ′(f) = Uψ(f)U −1.
 

Fermion Fock Spaces
363
Remark 6.4. (i) Taking the adjoint of the ﬁrst equation in (b) in Deﬁnition
6.1(1), we have {ψ(f)∗, ψ(g)∗} = 0, f, g ∈W .
(ii) It is easy to see that the representation (F, A(W )) is irreducible if
and only there exist no proper subspaces of F which remain invariant under
the action of all operators ψ(f) and ψ(f)∗(f ∈W ) in A(W ) (cf. Remark
5.6).
Let D be a subspace of K . Then (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D}) is a
representation of the CAR over D. This representation is called the Fock
representation of the CAR over D. The following fact is important:
Theorem 6.22. Suppose that D is dense in K . Then the Fock represen-
tation (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D}) is irreducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D}′ so that, for all u ∈D, B(u)#T =
T B(u)#.
Then, by (6.13), B(u)T ΩK
= 0.
Hence, by Theorem 6.15,
there exists a constant α ∈C such that T ΩK
= αΩK .
Let Ψ :=
B(u1)∗· · · B(up)∗ΩK (uj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , p, p ∈N).
Then it follows
from the commutativity of T and B(uj)∗that T Ψ = αΨ. Since the sub-
space algebraically spanned by vectors of the form Ψ is dense in Ff(K )
and T is bounded, it follows that T = αI. Thus, by Proposition 5.9(i),
{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D} is irreducible.
Example 6.4. Let S ∈B(K ) such that S∗S = I and let
BS(u) := B(Su),
u ∈K .
Then it is easy to see that (Ff(K ), {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) is a repre-
sentation of the CAR over K . There are two cases to be considered:
(i) The case where S is unitary. In this case, we have
BS(u) = Γf(S)B(u)Γf(S)−1,
u ∈K .
Hence (Ff(K ), {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }).
(ii) The case where S is not unitary. In this case (RanS)⊥̸= {0}. Let
v ∈(RanS)⊥and v ̸= 0. Then, by direct computations using the CAR
for B(·)#, we have for all u ∈K
[BS(u), B(v)∗B(v)] = ⟨Su, v⟩B(v) = 0.
Hence B(v)∗B(v) ∈{BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }′ and B(v)∗B(v) is not a
scalar operator (Problem 12). Therefore {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K } is
reducible.
 

364
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
To analyze the structure of the reducibility of {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K },
we note the orthogonal decomposition
K = RanS ⊕ker S∗.
Hence
Ff(K ) ∼= Ff(RanS) ⊗Ff(ker S∗).
Under this isomorphism, BS(u)# is unitarily equivalent to B(Su)#⊗I.
Let {Ψn}N
n=1 (N ∈N or N = ∞) be a CONS of Ff(ker S∗) and Hn =
{αΨn|α ∈C}. Then Ff(ker S∗) = ⊕N
n=1Hn. Hence
Ff(K ) ∼= ⊕N
n=1Ff(RanS) ⊗Hn ∼= ⊕N
n=1Mn,
where Mn := Ff(RanS). Under this isomorphism, BS(u)# is reduced
by Mn and (Mn, {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) gives an irreducible repre-
sentation of the CAR over K . Since Γf(S) is a unitary from Ff(K )
to Ff(RanS), we have Γf(S)B(u)#Γf(S)−1 = BS(u)# on Ff(RanS).
Hence, for each n, (Mn, {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) is equivalent to
(Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }). Thus (Ff(K ), {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈
K }) is equivalent to a direct sum of irreducible representations of the
CAR over K , each of which is equivalent to the Fock representation
of the CAR over K .
6.14
Fermionic Bogoliubov Transformations
Also for the fermion annihilation and creation operators, one can consider
analogues of Bogoliubov transformations of the boson annihilatin and cre-
ation operators. Let C be a conjugation on K and S, T ∈B(K ) satisfying
S∗S + T ∗T = I,
S∗T + T ∗S = 0,
(6.40)
where, for A ∈B(K ), A := CAC as before. Note the diﬀerence from the
bosonic case (5.180) in that the plus sign appears on the left hand side of
each equation in (6.40).
Then one deﬁnes
BS,T (u) := B(Su) + B(CT u)∗,
u ∈K .
Then it is easy to see that (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }) is a rep-
resentation of the CAR over K .
The correspondence:{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈
K } 7→{BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K } is called the fermionic Bogoliubov
transformation associated with (S, T ).
 

Fermion Fock Spaces
365
Also for the fermionic Bogoliubov transformation, one has a result cor-
responding to Theorem 5.48 on a bosonic Bogoliubov transformation.
Theorem 6.23. Consider the case where S is surjective: RanS = K .
Suppose that T is not Hilbert-Schmidt. Then (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|
u ∈K }) is inequivalent to (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }).
Proof. The method of proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.48. We prove
the contraposition of the above statement. So suppose that there exists a
unitary operator U on Ff(K ) such that UBS,T(u)U −1 = B(u), u ∈K .
Let Ω:= U −1ΩK . Then ∥Ω∥= 1 (hence Ω̸= 0) and BS,T (u)Ω= 0, i.e.,
B(CT u)∗Ω= −B(Su)Ω. Since S is surjective, we have
B(CLu)∗Ω= −B(u)Ω,
u ∈K ,
where L := T S−1. For each n ≥1, we deﬁne a vector Ωn in the n-particle
space by Ω(n)
n
:= Ω(n) and Ω(m)
n
:= 0, m ̸= n. Then we have Ω= P∞
n=0 Ωn.
Since B(·)# is bounded, it follows that
∞
X
n=0
B(CLu)∗Ωn = −
∞
X
n=1
B(u)Ωn,
where we have used that B(u)Ω0 = 0. Hence
B(u)Ω1 = 0,
B(CLu)∗Ωn−1 = −B(u)Ωn+1,
n ≥1.
It follows from the ﬁrst equation and Theorem 6.15 that Ω1 = 0. Then, by
the second equation with n = 2, B(u)Ω3 = 0, u ∈K . Hence, by Theorem
6.15 again, Ω3 = 0. By induction in n, one can show that Ω2n−1 = 0, n ≥1.
Taking n = 1 in the second equation, one has B(CLu)∗Ω0 = −B(u)Ω2. If
Ω0 = 0, then B(u)Ω2 = 0, u ∈K . Hence, by Theorem 6.15, Ω2 = 0. Then,
by induction, one has Ω2n = 0 for all n ∈Z+. Thus Ω= 0. But this is a
contradiction. Therefore Ω0 ̸= 0. Hence Ω0 = αΩK with some α ∈C\{0}.
Then B(CLu)∗ΩK = −α−1B(u)Ω2. Taking the norm of the both sides,
we obtain ∥Lu∥= |α|−1∥B(u)Ω2∥. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of K . Then
P∞
n=1 ∥Len∥2 = |α|−2 P∞
n=1 ∥B(en)Ω2∥2, which is ﬁnite by Theorem 6.12.
Hence L is Hilbert-Schmidt. Thus T = LS is Hilbert-Schmidt.
With regard to irreducibility of {BS,T(u), BS,T (u)∗|u ∈K }, the follow-
ing theorem holds.
Theorem 6.24. Assume (6.40) and
SS∗+ T T
∗= I,
ST ∗+ T S
∗= 0.
(6.41)
 

366
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T (u)∗|u ∈K }) is an irreducible representa-
tion of the CAR over K .
Proof. Using (6.41), one can express B(u) in terms of BS,T (·)# as follows:
B(u) = BS,T (S∗u) + BS,T (T ∗Cu)∗,
u ∈K .
Hence, for all A ∈{BS,T(u), BS,T (u)∗|u ∈K }′, A ∈{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈
K }′ = CI. Therefore {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }′ = CI. Thus the desired
result follows.
Remark 6.5. Under conditions (6.40) and (6.41), one can prove the con-
verse of Theorem 6.23:
If T is Hilbert-Schmidt, then (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }) is
equivalent to (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }).
For a proof of this fact, see, e.g., [Ottesen (1995), Theorem 3].

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and
Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac
Type Operators
The tensor product of a boson Fock space and a fermion Fock space gives a
new Hilbert space, called a boson-fermion Fock space, which, in applications to
quantum ﬁeld theory, makes a mathematical framework to describe interactions
of a Bose ﬁeld and a Fermi ﬁeld. In this chapter, we discuss fundamental aspects
of analysis on boson-fermion Fock space.
7.1
Fundamental
Structures
of
a
Boson-Fermion
Fock
Space
Let H and K be complex Hilbert spaces. Then the tensor product
F(H , K ) := Fb(H ) ⊗Ff(K )
of the boson Fock space Fb(H ) and the fermion Fock space Ff(K ) is
called the boson-fermion Fock space over the pair (H , K ) of Hilbert
spaces.
The concept of a boson-fermion Fock space is a general concept unifying
in a natural way both a boson Fock space and a fermion Fock space. Indeed,
there exists an isometry Ub from Fb(H ) into F(H , K ) such that
UbΨ = Ψ ⊗ΩK ,
Ψ ∈Fb(H ).
In this sense, the boson Fock space Fb(H ) is isomorphic to the sub-
space Fb(H ) ⊗{αΩK |α ∈C} of F(H , K ). Similarly, the fermion Fock
space Ff(K ) is isomorphic to the subspace {αΩH |α ∈C} ⊗Ff(K ) of
F(H , K ).
A boson-fermion Fock space as an extension of a boson Fock space and
a fermion Fock space may have a variety of operators which are essentially
diﬀerent from those on a boson Fock space as well as on a fermion Fock
space. It would be interesting to ﬁnd such operators and analyze them. In

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
addition, from a mathematical physics point of view, one is led to consider
their roles in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory.
Remark 7.1. Consider the case where H and K are ﬁnite dimensional
with dim H = n and dim K = r. Then, under the isomorphism H ∼= Cn
and K ∼= Cr, we have
Fb(H ) ∼= L2(Rn),
∧(K ) ∼= ∧(Cr).
Hence, under these isomorphisms,
F(H , K ) ∼= L2(Rn) ⊗∧(Cr).
(7.1)
As a ﬁrst step towards analysis on a boson-fermion Fock space, we begin
with considering a basic structure of a boson-fermion Fock space.
Lemma 7.1. Let X and Yn (n ∈{0} ∪N) be Hilbert spaces and
Y := ⊕∞
n=0Yn.
Let
Z := ⊕∞
n=0X ⊗Yn.
Then there exists a unique unitary transformation U : X ⊗Y →Z such
that, for all ψ ∈X , φ = {φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈Y ,
U(ψ ⊗φ) = {ψ ⊗φ(n)}∞
n=0.
(7.2)
Proof. Let {eα}α∈A be a CONS of X (A is an index set). Then D0 :=
span {eα ⊗φ|α ∈A, φ ∈Y } is dense in X ⊗Y . Each vector Ψ ∈D0 is
uniquely written as Ψ = PN
k=1 eαk ⊗φk with αk ∈A, φk = {φ(n)
k }∞
n=0 ∈Y .
Deﬁne a linear mapping U0 : D0 →Z by
U0(Ψ) :=
( N
X
k=1
eαk ⊗φ(n)
k
)∞
n=0
.
By direct computations, we have
∥U0(Ψ)∥2 =
∞
X
n=0
N
X
k=1
φ(n)
k

2
=
N
X
k=1
∥φk∥2 = ∥Ψ∥2.
Hence U0 is isometry. On the other hand, the algebraic inﬁnite direct sum
b⊕
∞
n=0
 span {eα|α ∈A})b⊗Yn

is dense in Z . Hence Ran(U0) is dense in Z .
Thus U0 has a unique unitary extension U : X ⊗Y →Z . This unitary
operator U satisﬁes (7.2). It is easy to prove the uniqueness of U.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
371
Henceforth, we sometimes write
X ⊗Y = ⊕∞
n=0X ⊗Yn
in the sense of the isomorphism in Lemma 7.1.
We introduce subspaces
F (n)
b
(H , K ) := (⊗n
s H ) ⊗Ff(K ),
n ≥0,
^p
(H , K ) := Fb(H ) ⊗∧p(K ),
p ≥0.
By a simple application of Lemma 7.1, we have the following identiﬁcations:
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
n=0F (n)
b
(H , K ),
(7.3)
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
p=0
^p
(H , K ).
(7.4)
Moreover, noting that
^p
(H , K ) = ⊕∞
n=0 [(⊗n
s H ) ⊗∧p(K )] ,
we have
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
p=0 ⊕∞
n=0 [(⊗n
s H ) ⊗∧p(K )] .
(7.5)
Hence, introducing
Fr(H , K ) := ⊕n+p=r [(⊗n
s H ) ⊗∧p(K )]
we obtain
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
r=0Fr(H , K ).
(7.6)
Let us consider the meaning of the orthogonal decompositions (7.3),
(7.4) and (7.6). The boson number operator Nb on Fb(H ) is extended
to Nb ⊗I as an operator on F(H , K ). Similarly the fermion number
operator Nf on Ff(K ) yields I ⊗Nf acting in F(H , K ). We have
Nb ⊗IΨ = nΨ,
Ψ ∈F (n)
b
(H , K ).
Hence F (n)
b
(H , K ) is the eigenspace of Nb ⊗I with eigenvalue n. There-
fore (7.3) is the orthogonal decomposition of F(H , K ) in terms of the
eigenspaces of Nb ⊗I.
Similarly one can see that Vp(H , K ) is the eigenspace of I ⊗Nf
with eigenvalue p and hence (7.4) gives the orthogonal decomposition of
F(H , K ) in terms of these eigenspaces.
The operator sum
Ntot := Nb ⊗I + I ⊗Nf
 

372
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on F(H , K ). We call it the total
number operator on F(H , K ).
As is easily seen, for each r ≥0, Fr(H , K ) is the eigenspace of
Ntot with eigenvalue r.
Hence (7.6) is the orthogonal decomposition of
F(H , K ) in terms of the eigenspaces of Ntot.
Remark 7.2. Let H be the complexiﬁcation of a real separable inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space. Then, as we have seen in Theorem 5.53, Fb(H )
is isomorphic to L2( ˙R∞, dµ) in a natural way. Hence
∧p(H , K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dµ) ⊗∧p(K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dµ; ∧p(K )).
An element in L2( ˙R∞, dµ; ∧p(K )) can be interpreted as a p-form on the
inﬁnite dimensional space ˙R∞. Therefore ∧p(H , K ) can be viewed as a
space of p-forms on an inﬁnite dimensional space. We also have
F(H , K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dµ) ⊗Ff(K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dµ; Ff(K )).
7.2
Second Quantization Operators on the Boson-Fermion
Fock Space F(H , K )
Let T1 and T2 be densely deﬁned closable operators on H and K respec-
tively. Then one can deﬁne
dΓ(T1, T2) := dΓb(T1) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(T2).
We call this operator the second quantization operator for the pair
(T1, T2).
Proposition 7.1. Let T1 and T2 be self-adjoint. Then:
(i) dΓ(T1, T2) is self-adjoint.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are non-negative, then dΓ(T1, T2) is non-negative.
(iii) If F1 is a core for dΓb(T1) and F2 is a core for dΓf(T2), then F1 ˆ⊗F2
is a core for dΓ(T1, T2).
Proof. (i) Under the present assumption, dΓb(T1) and dΓf(T2) are self-
adjoint. Hence, by a simple application of Theorem 3.8(i), dΓ(T1, T2) is
self-adjoint.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are non-negative, then so are dΓb(T1) and dΓf(T2).
Hence dΓ(T1, T2) is non-negative.
(iii) This follows from an application of Theorem 3.8(iii).
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
373
One can also apply other results in the theory of tensor products of
self-adjoint operators as presented in Chapter 3 to study more detailed
properties of dΓ(T1, T2), e.g., spectral ones. But, here, we do not go into
the details. The reader is asked to work on those aspects.
A natural extension of Γ-operators in the boson Fock space and the
fermion Fock space is given by
Γ(T1, T2) := Γb(T1) ⊗Γf(T2).
On this object too, we only state a few facts (a more detailed study is of
course possible).
Proposition 7.2.
(i) If T1 and T2 are contractions, then Γ(T1, T2) is a contraction.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are unitary operators, then Γ(T1, T2) is unitary.
(iii) If A and B are self-adjoint operators on H and K respectively, then
Γ(eitA, eitB) = eitdΓ(A,B),
t ∈R.
(iv) If A and B are non-negative self-adjoint operators on H
and K
respectively, then dΓ(A, B) is non-negative and
Γ(e−tA, e−tB) = e−tdΓ(A,B),
t ≥0.
Proof. (i) If T1 and T2 are contractions, then so are Γb(T1) and Γf(T2).
Hence Γb(T1) ⊗Γf(T2) is a contraction.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are unitary operators, then so are Γb(T1) and Γf(T2).
Hence Γb(T1) ⊗Γf(T2) is unitary.
(iii) The self-adjoint operators dΓb(A) ⊗I and I ⊗dΓf(B) strongly
commute. Hence, for all t ∈R,
eidΓ(A,B) = eitdΓb(A) ⊗eitdΓf(B) = Γb(eitA) ⊗Γf(eitB).
Hence the desired result follows.
(iv) Similar to the proof of (iii).
7.3
Operators of Co-boundary Type
In this section, we introduce an inﬁnite dimensional version of exterior
diﬀerential operators on ﬁnite dimensional manifolds (see (7.1)1).
1For example, in the Hilbert space L2(Rn) ⊗∧(Cn) (the case r = n), an exterior
diﬀerential operator is given by d = Pn
j=1 ∂j ⊗b∗
j , where bj := B(ej)∗(j = 1, . . . , n) with
{ej}n
j=1 being the standard basis of Cn. It is easy to see that d2 = 0 on C∞
0 (Rn)ˆ⊗∧(Cn).
 

374
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We denote by C(H , K ) the set of densely deﬁned closed linear operators
from H to K . Let S ∈C(H , K ). Then D(S∗) is dense in K . Hence
there exists a CONS {ξn}∞
n=1 of K such that ξn ∈D(S∗), n ∈N. For each
N ∈N, we deﬁne a linear operator dS,N on F(H , K ) by
dS,N :=
N
X
n=1
A(S∗ξn) ⊗B(ξn)∗,
where A(f) is the boson annihilation operator with test vector f ∈H and
B(g)∗is the fermion creation operator with test vector g ∈K . It is obvious
that
D(dS,N) ⊃Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗Ff(K ).
and dS,N leaves Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗Ff(K ) invariant.
Lemma 7.2. For all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ),
dSΨ := s- lim
N→∞dS,NΨ
(7.7)
exists and, for all ℓ∈N, fj ∈D(S) (j = 1, . . . , ℓ) and φ ∈Ff(K ),
dSΩH ⊗φ = 0,

A(f1)∗· · · \
A(fj)∗· · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗B(Sfj)∗φ,
(7.9)
where \
A(fj) indicates the omission of A(fj).
Proof. Let fj ∈D(S) (j = 1, . . . , ℓ) and φ ∈Ff(K ). Then, using the
CCR for A(·)# and the fact that, for all f ∈H , A(f)ΩH = 0, we have
dS,NΩH ⊗φ = 0,
A(S∗ξn)A(f1)∗· · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH
=
ℓ
X
j=1
⟨ξn, Sfj⟩A(f1)∗· · · \
A(fj) · · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH .
The ﬁrst equation implies (7.8). The second equation yields
dS,N(A(f1)∗· · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗φ)
=
ℓ
X
j=1
A(f1)∗· · · \
A(fj) · · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗B(u(j)

where u(j)
N
:= PN
n=1 ⟨ξn, Sfj⟩ξn. Since {ξn}∞
n=1 is a CONS of K , it fol-
lows that limN→∞u(j)
N = Sfj. Hence limN→∞∥B(u(j)
N )∗−B(Sfj)∗∥= 0.
Therefore

j=1
A(f1)∗· · · \
A(fj) · · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗B(Sfj)∗φ.
Thus the desired results follow.
The mapping dS : Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) →F(H , K ) deﬁned by (7.7)
can be viewed as a linear operator on F(H , K ) with domain D(dS) =
Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ). By (7.9), it is independent of the choice of {ξn}∞
n=1.
Remark 7.3. In the case where dim K < ∞, we deﬁne dS by
dS :=
dim K
X
n=1
A(S∗ξn) ⊗B(ξn)∗.
In this case too, (7.9) holds and hence dS is independent of the choice of
the orthonormal basis {ξn}dim K
n=1
.
Remark 7.4. Let Hreal be a real separable inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
space whose complexiﬁcation is equal to H .
Then, under the natural
isomorphism
F(H , K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dµ) ⊗Ff(K )
(see Remark 7.2), we have the unitary equivalence
A(f) ∼=
1
√
2Df
for all f ∈Hreal, where Df is the directional derivative with respect to f
(see (5.216) and (5.220)). Hence
dS ∼=

on a suitable dense subspace. The operator on the right hand side with
H = K and S = I (identity) can be viewed as an inﬁnite dimensional
version of an exterior diﬀerential operator on a ﬁnite dimensional manifold.
Thus dS with a general triple (H , K , S) may be regarded as an abstract
version of operators of exterior diﬀerential type on ﬁnite dimensional man-
ifolds.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Since Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) is dense in F(H , K ), dS is densely de-
ﬁned.
Proposition 7.3. Let S, T ∈C(H , K ).
(i) The operator dS leaves Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) invariant.
(ii) The operators dS and dT anti-commute on Fb,ﬁn(D(S) ∩D(T )) ˆ⊗
Ff(K ):
{dS, dT } = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(D(S) ∩D(T ))ˆ⊗Ff(K ).
(7.10)
In particular,

S = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ).
(7.11)
(iii)
D(d∗

Moreover, for all ψ ∈Fb,0(H ) and uk ∈D(S∗), k = 1, . . . , m,

(iv) The operator dS is closable.
Proof. (i) This follows from (7.9).
(ii) Let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S) ∩D(T ))ˆ⊗Ff(K ).
Then, by using (7.9) repeatedly, we have
dT dSΨ =

(7.14)
Since B(T fk)∗B(Sfj)∗= −B(Sfj)∗B(T fk)∗, it follows that the right hand
side of (7.14) is equal to −dSdT Ψ. Hence {dT , dS}Ψ = 0. Therefore (7.10)
holds. Taking T = S in (7.10), one obtains (7.11).
(iii) Let ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), uk ∈D(S∗) (k = 1, . . . , m) and
φm := B(u1)∗· · · B(um)∗ΩK .
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators

Then ψ ⊗φm ∈Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(S∗)) and, for all Ψ ∈D(dS),
⟨ψ ⊗φm, dSΨ⟩= lim

If φm = ΩK (the case m = 0), B(ξn)φm = 0. Hence ⟨ψ ⊗ΩK , dSΨ⟩= 0.
Therefore ψ ⊗ΩK ∈D(d∗
S) and (7.12) holds.
By using the CAR for B(·)#, we have

A(S∗ξn)∗ψ ⊗B(ξn)φm =

B(uk)∗· · · B(um)∗ΩK .
Let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗φ (fj ∈D(S), j = 1, . . . , ℓ, φ ∈Ff(K )).
Then

By linearity, this extends to all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) = D(dS). Hence

(7.15)
Therefore Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗∧ﬁn(D(S∗)) ⊂D(d∗
S). Equation (7.15) implies (7.13).
(iv) By (iii), D(d∗
S) is dense. Hence dS is closable.
In what follows, for notational simplicity, we denote the closure of dS by
the same symbol. Hence dS is a densely deﬁned closed operator such that
Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) ⊂D(dS)
and Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) is a core for dS.
It follows from the deﬁnition of dS that, for all α ∈C,
dαS = αdS.
(7.16)
Proposition 7.4.
(i) For all Ψ ∈D(dS), Ψ ∈D(d2
S) and d2
SΨ = 0.
(ii) For all Φ ∈D(d∗
S), Φ ∈D((d∗
S)2) and (d∗
S)2Φ = 0.
Proof. (i) There exists a sequence {Ψn}n in Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) such
that Ψn →Ψ and dSΨn →dSΨ (n →∞).
By (7.11), dS(dSΨn) = 0.
Hence, by the closedness of dS, dSΨ ∈D(dS) and dS(dSψ) = 0.
(ii) By (i), for all Ψ ∈D(dS) and Φ ∈D(d∗
S),

Φ, d2
SΨ

= 0. Hence
⟨d∗
SΦ, dSΨ⟩= 0 = ⟨0, Ψ⟩. Hence d∗
SΦ ∈D(d∗
S) and d∗
S(d∗
SΦ) = 0.
It is seen from the deﬁnition of dS that, for each p ≥0, dS maps D(dS)∩
Vp(H , K ) into Vp+1(H , K ). Hence an operator dS,p from Vp(H , K )
to Vp+1(H , K ) is naturally deﬁned as follows:2
D(dS,p) := D(dS) ∩
^p(H , K ),
dS,pΨ := (dSΨ)(p+1), Ψ ∈D(dS,p).
Proposition 7.5. For all p ≥0, dS,p+1dS,p = 0 on D(dS,p).
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(dS,p). Then, by Proposition 7.4(i), d2
SΨ = 0. Hence
0 = (d2
SΨ)(p+2) = dS,p+1(dSΨ)(p+1) = dS,p+1dS,pΨ.
2As mentioned before, we freely use the identiﬁcation of a vector Ψ(p) ∈∧p(H , K )
with {0, . . . , 0, Ψ(p), 0, . . .} ∈F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
q=0 ∧q (H , K ).

Proposition 7.5 implies that

The adjoint d∗

Laplace-Beltrami Operators
Based on analogy with analysis on diﬀerential forms on a ﬁnite dimensional
manifold, it is natural to consider the operator
∆S,p := d∗
S,pdS,p + dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1,
p ≥0,
(7.20)
 

380
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
acting in ∧p(H , K ), where dS,−1 := 0.
We call this operator the pth
Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the co-chain complex
(b⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS). We have
∆S,0 = d∗
S,0dS,0.
(7.21)
To study properties of ∆S,p, we prepare some lemmas.
Lemma 7.3. Let X and Y be Hilbert spaces and A, B be closed operators
from X to Y such that, for all ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B), ⟨Aψ, Bψ⟩= 0. Then
∥(A + B)ψ∥2 = ∥Aψ∥2 + ∥Bψ∥2,
ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B).
(7.22)
In particular, A + B is closed.
Proof. Equation (7.22) follows from direct commutations and the assumed
property for A and B. Then, by Theorem 1.4, A + B is closed.
We introduce a subspace
DS,p := Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗S))ˆ⊗Ap(ˆ⊗
pD(SS∗)),
p ≥0.
(7.23)
By von Neumann’s theorem, D(S∗S) and D(SS∗) are dense in H and
K respectively, and S∗S and SS∗are non-negative self-adjoint operators.
Hence DS,p is dense in ∧p(H , K ).
Lemma 7.4. For all p ≥0, ∆S,p is a closed, non-negative symmetric
operator with
DS,p ⊂D(∆S,p)
(7.24)
and, for all Ψ ∈D(∆S,p),
∥∆S,pΨ∥2 = ∥d∗
S,pdS,pΨ∥2 + ∥dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1Ψ∥2.
(7.25)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(d∗
S,pdS,p) ∩D(dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1). Then, by Proposition 7.5,

d∗
S,pdS,pΨ, dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1Ψ

= 0.
Hence, by Lemma 7.3, ∆S,p is closed and (7.25) holds.
It follows from (7.9) and (7.13) that
Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗S))ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(SS∗)) ⊂D(d∗
SdS) ∩D(dSd∗
S).
Hence it follows that
DS,p ⊂D(d∗
S,pdS,p) ∩D(dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1).
Therefore (7.24) holds and ∆S,p is densely deﬁned.
By von Neumann’s
theorem, d∗
S,pdS,p and dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1 are non-negative self-adjoint. Thus ∆S,p
is a non-negative symmetric operator.

For a self-adjoint operator T on K , we deﬁne
dΓ(p)
f
(T ) := T (p)
f
(7.26)
(see (6.2)).
We now prove an important theorem:
Theorem 7.1. For all p ≥0, ∆S,p is a non-negative self-adjoint operator
and operator equality
∆S,p = dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f

(7.27)
holds.
Proof. Let n ∈N, fj ∈D(S∗S) (j = 1, . . . , n), uk ∈D(SS∗) (k = 1, . . . , p)
and
Ψ(f1, . . . , fn; u1, . . . , up) := A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ⊗B(u1)∗· · · B(up)∗ΩK ,
which is in DS,p. Then, by (7.9) and (7.13), we have

On the other hand, by the commutativity of A(·)∗’s, we have

By using the anti-commutativity of B(·)∗’s, we have

Hence
∆S,pΨ(f1, . . . , fn; u1, . . . , up)
= [dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗)]Ψ(f1, . . . , fn; u1, . . . , up).
This means that (7.27) holds on DS,p. Namely
[dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗)] ↾DS,p ⊂∆S,p
The subspace Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗S)) is a core for dΓb(S∗S) and Ap(ˆ⊗
pD(SS∗))
is a core for dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗).
Hence DS,p is a core for dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗
dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗). As we already know, dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗) is self-
adjoint and ∆S,p is closed. Hence
dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗) ⊂∆S,p.
But a self-adjoint operator has no non-trivial symmetric extension. Thus
operator equality (7.27) follows and, at the same time, the self-adjointness
of ∆S,p is proved.
Theorem 7.1 is interesting in that it clariﬁes a homological origin of
a class of operators made of second quantization operators on the boson-
fermion Fock space F(H , K ) (note that I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗) is a reduced part
of I ⊗dΓf(SS∗)).
We also consider the operator
∆S := d∗
SdS + dSd∗
S

acting in F(H , K ). We call it the total Laplace-Beltrami operator

Theorem 7.2. Operator equality

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that

(7.29)
Let Ψ = {Ψ(p)}∞
p=0 ∈D(∆S). Then Ψ ∈D(d∗

S,pdS,p) and
(d∗
SdSΨ)(p) = d∗
S,p(dSΨ)(p+1) = d∗
S,pdS,pΨ(p).
(7.30)
Similarly, property Ψ ∈D(dSd∗

D(dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1) and
(dSd∗
SΨ)(p) = dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1Ψ(p).
(7.31)
Hence
Ψ(p) ∈D(∆S,p),

Hence Ψ ∈D(⊕∞

∥∆S,pΨ(p)∥2 < ∞.

Hence Ψ ∈D(∆S). Thus (7.29) holds.
It follows from (7.30) and (7.31) that (∆SΨ)(p) = ∆S,pΨ(p), Ψ ∈
D(∆S). This equation and (7.29) imply (7.28).
The operator on the right hand side of (7.28) is a non-negative self-
adjoint operator. Hence so is ∆S.
Theorem 7.2 is rephrased as follows:
Corollary 7.1. The operator ∆S is reduced by each ∧p(H , K ) (p ≥0)
and its reduced part to ∧p(H , K ) is ∆S,p.
The operator ∆S is related to second quantization operators in a beau-
tiful way:
Theorem 7.3. The following operator equality holds:
∆S = dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(SS∗).
(7.32)
Proof. It follows from Theorem 7.1 that
⊕∞
p=0∆S,p = dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(SS∗).
By this fact and Theorem 7.2, we obtain (7.32).
We next want to consider the cohomology group associated with the
co-chain complex (b⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS). But, before discussing this subject,
for the reader’s convenience, we ﬁrst recall the concept of quotient space of
a Hilbert space.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
385
7.5
Quotient Hilbert Space
Let X be a vector space over K and M be a subspace of X . Then one
can deﬁne a relation
M∼in X by
ψ
M∼φ
def
⇐⇒ψ −φ ∈M
(ψ, φ ∈X ).
It is easy to see that the relation
M∼is an equivalence relation. For each
ψ ∈X , we denote by [ψ] the equivalence class of ψ:
[ψ] := {φ ∈X |φ
M∼ψ}.
The set of all equivalence classes
X /M := {[ψ]|ψ ∈X }
becomes a vector space by the following additive operation + and scalar
multiplication:
[ψ] + [φ] := [ψ + φ],
α[ψ] := [αψ],
ψ, φ ∈X , α ∈K.
This vector space is called the quotient space of X by M . The zero-
vector in X /M is [η] with η ∈M .
Let us consider the case where X is a Hilbert space and M is a closed
subspace of X . We denote by P⊥the orthogonal projection onto M ⊥.
For each element ([ψ], [φ]) ∈(X /M ) × (X /M ), we deﬁne a number
⟨[ψ], [φ]⟩X /M ∈K by
⟨[ψ], [φ]⟩X /M := ⟨P⊥ψ, P⊥φ⟩.
It is easy to show that this is well-deﬁned (i.e. it is independent of the
choice of representatives of [ψ] and [φ])3 and ⟨·, ·⟩X /M is an inner product
of X /M .4
Moreover, the inner product space X /M is complete, i.e.,
it is a Hilbert space.5 The Hilbert space (X /M , ⟨·, ·⟩X /M) is called the
quotient Hilbert space of X by M .
Lemma 7.5. The quotient Hilbert space X /M is isomorphic to M ⊥by
the correspondence
[ψ] 7→P⊥ψ,
[ψ] ∈X /M .
(7.33)
3Note that, ψ
M
∼ψ′ ∈X and φ
M
∼φ′ ∈X , then P⊥(ψ −ψ′) = 0, P⊥(φ −φ′) = 0 and
hence P⊥ψ = P⊥ψ′, P⊥φ = P⊥φ′.
4If ∥[ψ]∥X /M = 0, then P⊥ψ = 0, implying ψ ∈M , where the closedness of M is
used. Hence [ψ] = 0. Therefore the positive-deﬁniteness of inner product holds. Other
properties of inner product can be easily checked.
5Let {[ψn]}∞
n=1 be a Cauchy sequence in X /M .
Then {P⊥ψn}∞
n=1 is a Cauchy
sequence in X .
Since M ⊥is closed, there exists a vector φ ∈M ⊥such that
P⊥ψn →φ (n →∞). Using the fact P⊥φ = φ, we see that ∥[ψn] −[φ]∥X /M →0
(n →∞). Thus X /M is complete.
 

386
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let U denote the correspondence given by (7.33): U[ψ] := P⊥ψ. It
is easy to see that U is well-deﬁned and linear. For each φ ∈M ⊥, U[φ] =
P⊥φ = φ. Hence U is surjective. We have ∥U[ψ]∥= ∥P⊥ψ∥= ∥[ψ]∥X /M.
Hence U is an isometry. Thus U is unitary.
In the sense of the isomorphism stated in Lemma 7.5, we write
X /M ∼= M ⊥.
7.6
Cohomology Groups and De Rham-Hodge-Kodaira
Decomposition
We now turn to the co-chain complex (b⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS). By analogy of the
de Rham cohomology group on a ﬁnite dimensional manifold, we introduce
the following sets:
H0
S := ker dS,0,
Hp
S := ker dS,p/Ran dS,p−1,
p ≥1.
The set H0
S is a Hilbert space as a closed subspace of V0(H , K ) and, as
we have seen above, Hp
S (p ≥1) is a quotient Hilbert space (note that, by
(7.17), Ran dS,p−1 ⊂ker dS,p). We call Hp
S the pth cohomology group
associated with (b⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS).
By Lemma 7.5 and the fact that D⊥= D
⊥for all subsets D of a Hilbert
space, we have
Hp
S ∼= (Ran dS,p−1)⊥∩ker dS,p,
p ≥1.
(7.34)
This gives an isomorphism of Hp
S. But the Hilbert space (RandS,p−1)⊥∩
ker dS,p is somewhat diﬃcult to grasp in a direct way. Thus we want to
ﬁnd another isomorphism of Hp
S. For this purpose, we ﬁrst prove a general
fact:
Lemma 7.6. Let H1, H2 and H3 be complex Hilbert spaces and Ai (i =
1, 2) be a densely deﬁned closed operator from Hi to Hi+1 such that, for
all η ∈D(A1) and φ ∈D(A∗
2), ⟨A1η, A∗
2φ⟩= 0. Let
LA1,A2 := A1A∗
1 + A∗
2A2
acting in H2. Then LA1,A2 is a closed operator and
H2 = RanA1 ⊕RanA∗
2 ⊕ker LA1,A2.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
387
Proof. It follows from the assumption that, for all ψ ∈D(A1A∗
1) ∩
D(A∗
2A2), ⟨A1A∗
1ψ, A∗
2A2ψ⟩= 0. Hence, by Lemma 7.3, LA1,A2 is closed.
The assumption implies also that RanA1 is orthogonal to RanA∗
2. Hence
we have the orthogonal decomposition
H2 = RanA1 ⊕RanA∗
2 ⊕W,
where W :=
 RanA1 ⊕RanA∗
2
⊥= (RanA1)⊥∩(RanA∗
2)⊥.
Let Ψ ∈W. Then, for all Φ ∈D(A1), ⟨Ψ, A1Φ⟩= 0. Hence Ψ ∈D(A∗
1)
and A∗
1Ψ = 0. Also, for all Ξ ∈D(A∗
2), ⟨Ψ, A∗
2Ξ⟩= 0. Hence Ψ ∈D(A2)
and A2Ψ = 0. Therefore Ψ ∈D(LA1,A2) and LA1,A2Ψ = 0. Hence Ψ ∈
ker LA1,A2. Thus W ⊂ker LA1,A2.
Conversely, let Ψ ∈ker LA1,A2. Then, Ψ ∈D(A∗
2A2) ∩D(A1A∗
1) and
A∗
2A2Ψ + A1A∗
1Ψ = 0. Taking the inner product of this equation with Ψ,
we have ∥A2Ψ∥2 + ∥A∗
1Ψ∥2 = 0, which implies that A2Ψ = 0 and A∗
1Ψ = 0.
This means that Ψ ∈(RanA∗
2)⊥∩(RanA1)⊥. Hence Ψ ∈W. Therefore
ker LA1,A2 ⊂W. Thus we arrive at W = ker LA1,A2.
Now we can prove a decomposition theorem with respect to {dS,p}∞
p=0:
Theorem 7.4 (decomposition of de Rham-Hodge-Kodaira type).
For all p ≥0, the orthogonal decomposition
^p
(H , K ) = Ran dS,p−1 ⊕Ran d∗
S,p ⊕ker ∆S,p
(7.35)
holds.
Proof. We need only to apply Lemma 7.6 to the case where H1 =
∧p−1(H , K ), H2 = ∧p(H , K ), H3 = ∧p+1(H , K ), A1 = dS,p−1 and
A2 = dS,p.
7.7
Identiﬁcation of the Cohomology Groups
We now proceed to identifying Hp
S.
Proposition 7.7. For all p ≥0,
ker dS,p = Ran dS,p−1 ⊕ker ∆S,p.
(7.36)
Proof. Applying Theorem 1.8(ii) to the case where T = dS,p, we have
^p(H , K ) = ker dS,p ⊕Rand∗
S,p.
Comparing this with (7.35), we obtain (7.36).
 

388
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 7.7. Let T be a densely deﬁned operator from a Hilbert space X
to a Hilbert space Y . Then ker T ∗T = ker T .
Proof. Let ψ ∈ker T ∗T .
Then T ∗T ψ = 0.
Hence 0 = ⟨ψ, T ∗T ψ⟩=
⟨T ψ, T ψ⟩. Hence T ψ = 0, implying that ψ ∈ker T . Thus kerT ∗T ⊂ker T .
The converse inclusion relation is obvious.
Theorem 7.5.
H0
S = ker ∆S,0,
(7.37)
Hp
S ∼= ker ∆S,p,
p ≥1.
(7.38)
Proof. By Lemma 7.7, ker dS,0 = kerd∗
S,0dS,0 = ker ∆S,0. Hence (7.37)
holds. Isomorphism (7.38) follows from (7.34) and (7.36).
By Theorem 7.5, analysis of the pth cohomology group Hp
S is reduced
to that of ker ∆S,p. Hence we investigate this space below. But, for this
purpose, we need to know properties of kernel of operators. Since they have
independent interests, we here take an interlude to describe them.
7.8
Properties of Kernel of Some Operators
Lemma 7.8. Let A be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert
space. Then ker A = ker A1/2.
Proof. We have A = A1/2A1/2. Hence a simple application of Lemma 7.7
to the case T = A1/2 gives the desired result.
Lemma 7.9. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space X . Then
A is reduced by ker A and A is decomposed as A = 0 ⊕A⊥according to the
orthogonal decomposition X = ker A ⊕(ker A)⊥, where A⊥is the reduced
part of A to (ker A)⊥.
Proof. Let P be the orthogonal projection onto ker A. Then, for all ψ ∈
D(A), Pψ ∈ker A.
Hence Pψ ∈D(A) and APψ = 0.
Hence, for all
φ ∈D(A), ⟨PAφ, ψ⟩= 0. Since D(A) is dense, PAφ = 0. Hence APψ =
0 = PAψ. Therefore PA ⊂AP. Thus A is reduced by ker A. By the
argument just made, the reduced part of A to ker A is the zero operator on
ker A. Thus A = 0 ⊕A⊥.
Lemma 7.10. Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a Hilbert space and Mj be a closed
subspace of Hj. Then
∩N
j=1 (H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hj−1 ⊗Mj ⊗Hj+1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn) = ⊗N
j=1Mj.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
389
Proof. We give a proof only for the case N = 2 (the extension of it to a
general N is easy). Obviously we have
M1 b⊗M2 ⊂(M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2).
Taking the closure of the both sides and noting that the set on the right
hand side is a closed set, we obtain
M1 ⊗M2 ⊂(M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2).
Conversely, let ψ ∈(M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2). Then ψ ∈M1 ⊗H2 =
(M1 ⊗M2) ⊕(M1 ⊗M2
⊥). Hence we have ψ = u + v with u ∈M1 ⊗M2
and v ∈(M1 ⊗M ⊥
2 ). By the other condition ψ ∈H1 ⊗M2, we have
ψ −u ∈H1 ⊗M2. Hence⟨ψ −u, v⟩= 0. This implies that v = 0. Hence
ψ = u ∈M1 ⊗M2. Therefore (M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2) ⊂M1 ⊗M2.
Lemma 7.11. Let T1, . . . , TN be non-negative self-adjoint operators on a
Hilbert space X . Then
ker


N
X
j=1
Tj

= ∩N
j=1 ker Tj.
Proof. Let ψ ∈ker
PN
j=1 Tj

. Then, ψ ∈∩N
j=1D(Tj) and PN
j=1 Tjψ = 0.
Taking the inner product of this equation and ψ, we have
N
X
j=1
⟨ψ, Tjψ⟩= 0.
By the non-negativity of Tj, ⟨ψ, Tjψ⟩≥0. Hence, for each j = 1, . . . , N,
⟨ψ, Tjψ⟩= 0. This implies that T 1/2
j
ψ = 0. Hence, by Lemma 7.8, ψ ∈
ker Tj.
Therefore ker
PN
j=1 Tj

⊂∩N
j=1 ker Tj.
The converse inclusion

Theorem 7.6. Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a Hilbert space and Aj be a non-
negative self-adjoint operator on Hj.
Let eAj be the operator deﬁned by
(3.31). Then
ker



j=1 ker Aj.

Proof. Applying Lemma 7.11 to Tj = eAj, we have
ker



= ∩N
j=1 ker eAj.
By Lemma 3.3(i),
ker eAj = H1 ⊗· · · Hj−1 ⊗ker Aj ⊗Hj+1 ⊗· · · HN.
By this fact and Lemma 7.10, we obtain (7.39).
Lemma 7.12. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space X and
M be a closed subspace of X which reduces A. Let PM be the orthogonal
projection onto M and AM be the reduced part of A to M . Then
ker AM = PM ker A.
(7.40)
Proof. Let ψ ∈PM ker A. Then there exists a vector φ ∈ker A such that
ψ = PM φ. By the reducibility of A by M , ψ ∈D(A) ∩M = D(AM ) and
AM ψ = APM φ = PM Aφ = 0. Hence ψ ∈ker AM. Therefore PM ker A ⊂
ker AM .
Conversely, let ψ ∈ker AM . Then ψ ∈D(A) ∩M and Aψ = 0. Hence
ψ ∈ker A.
By this fact and ψ ∈M , ψ = PM ψ ∈PM ker A.
Hence
ker AM ⊂PM ker A. Thus (7.40) follows.

Kernel of Second Quantization Operators
We can apply the results in the preceding section to identify the kernel of
second quantization operators.
Let T and T ′ be self-adjoint operators on H and K respectively, and
T (n)
b
(n ≥0) be deﬁned by (5.3). For notational convenience, we introduce
the following symbol:
dΓ(n)
b (T ) := T (n)
b
,
n ≥0.
Then we have
dΓb(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0dΓ(n)
b (T ),

dΓf(T ′) = ⊕∞
p=0dΓ(p)

(7.42)
where dΓ(p)
f
(·) is deﬁned by (7.26).
Theorem 7.7. Let n, p ∈N.

(i) If T ≥0, then
ker dΓ(n)

(7.43)
and
ker dΓb(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n

(7.44)
(ii) If T ′ ≥0, then
ker dΓ(p)

(T ′) = ∧p ker T ′
(7.45)
and
ker dΓf(T ′) = ⊕∞
p=0 ∧p ker T ′.
(7.46)
Proof. (i) By Theorem 7.6, we have
ker T (n)(T ) = ⊗n ker T.
Hence, by Lemma 7.12, ker dΓ(n)
b (T ) = Sn(⊗n ker T ) = ⊗n
s ker T . Hence
(7.43) holds. Formula (7.44) follows from (7.41) and (7.43).
(ii) Similar to the proof of (i) (replace Sn by Ap).
7.10
The Kernel of ∆S,p and the Dimension of Hp
S
Theorem 7.8. Let S be a densely deﬁned closed operator from H to K .
Then, for all p ≥0,
ker ∆S,p = ⊕∞
n=0 [(⊗n
s ker S) ⊗(∧p ker S∗)] .
(7.47)
In particular, if p > dim ker S∗, then ker ∆S,p = {0}.
Proof. By Theorem 7.1 and Lemma 7.10, we have
ker ∆S,p = ker dΓb(S∗S) ⊗ker dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗).
Using (7.44) and (7.45), we can rewrite the right hand side to obtain
ker ∆S,p = ⊕∞
n=0 [(⊗n
s ker S∗S) ⊗∧p ker SS∗] .
By Lemma 7.7, ker S∗S = ker S and ker SS∗= ker S∗. Thus (7.47) follows.
If p > dim ker S∗, then ∧p ker S∗= {0}. Hence ker ∆S,p = {0}.
For a linear operator T from a Hilbert space to a Hilbert space,
nul T := dim ker T
is called the nullity of T . We remark that, in this deﬁnition, the case
nul T = ∞is allowed.
Theorem 7.9. Let 0 ≤p ≤nul S∗. Then
nul ∆S,p =
 
1 +

n=1
nul S+n−1Cn
!
nul S∗Cp,
(7.48)
where ∞Cp := ∞and n−1Cn := 0.

Proof. By (7.47), we have
nul ∆S,p =
 
1 +

X
n=1
dim ⊗n
s ker S
!
dim ∧p ker S∗.
By Remarks 2.7 and 2.9, we have
dim ⊗n
s ker S = nul (S)+n−1Cn,
dim ∧p ker S∗= nul S∗Cp.
Hence (7.48) follows.
Corollary 7.2. Let 0 ≤p ≤nul S∗.
(i) If nul S = 0, then
nul ∆S,p = nul S∗Cp.
(ii) If nul S ≥1, then
nul ∆S,p = ∞.
Proof. (i) If nul S = 0, then nul S+n−1Cn = 0. Hence the right hand side
of (7.48) is equal to nul S∗Cp.
(ii) If nul S ≥1, then
∞
X
n=1
nul S+n−1Cn ≥

X
n=1

(nul S −1)! = ∞.
Hence the right hand side of (7.48) becomes inﬁnity.
By Theorem 7.8 and Corollary 7.2, we obtain the following result on
dim Hp
S:
Corollary 7.3.
dim Hp

Inﬁnite-dimensional Dirac Type Operators on
F(H , K )
Besides the Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆S, there is a natural operator made
of dS which is deﬁned as follows:
QS := dS + d∗
S.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
393
Note that QS is twice the real part of dS.6 Taking into account that dS
is an operator of exterior diﬀerential type as pointed out in Remark 7.4,
we may regard the operator QS as an inﬁnite dimensional Dirac type
operator if H is inﬁnite-dimensional.7 From this point of view, we call
QS the Dirac operator associated with the operator S. We shall
justify this name in a more general context later (see Proposition 7.8 in the
next section).
Remark 7.5. One can consider also twice the imaginary part of dS:
eQS := −i(dS −d∗
S).
But, by (7.16), idS = diS and −id∗
S = d∗
iS. Hence
eQS = −QiS.
Therefore eQS is an element in {QS|S ∈C(H , K )}. One has
dS = 1
2(QS + i eQS)
on D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S).
It is obvious that QS is symmetric. Then it is interesting to ask if QS
is (essentially) self-adjoint. The answer is in the aﬃrmative. But, to prove
it, we need a lemma.
Lemma 7.13. Let A be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space X such
that A2 is self-adjoint. Then A is self-adjoint.
Proof. By the self-adjointness of A2 and A2 ≥0, Ran(A2 + 1) = X (see
Proposition 1.18). On the other hand, we have
A2 + 1 = (A + i)(A −i) = (A −i)(A + i).
Hence Ran(A ± i) = X . Hence, by a criterion for self-adjointness (Propo-
sition 1.17), A is self-adjoint.
Theorem 7.10.
(i) The operator QS is self-adjoint and operator equality
Q2
S = ∆S
(7.49)
holds.
6In general, for a linear operator A on a Hilbert space, A1 := (A + A∗)/2 and A2 :=
(A −A∗)/2i are called the real part and the imaginary part of A respectively. One
has A = A1 + iA2 on D(A) ∩D(A∗).
7For ﬁnite dimensional Dirac operators, see, e.g., [Balinsky and Evans (2011); Thaller
(1992)].
 

394
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) Every core for ∆S is a core for QS.
Proof. (i) Since D(QS) = D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S), we have
D(Q2
S) = {Ψ ∈D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S)|dSΨ + d∗
SΨ ∈D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S)}.
It follows from this and Proposition 7.4 that each Ψ ∈D(Q2
S) is in
D(d∗
SdS) ∩D(dSd∗
S) = D(∆S) and Q2
SΨ = ∆SΨ. Hence Q2
S ⊂∆S. Con-
versely let Ψ ∈D(∆S).
Then Ψ ∈D(d∗
SdS) ∩D(dSd∗
S).
Hence Ψ ∈
D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S) = D(QS) and dSΨ ∈D(d∗
S), d∗
SΨ ∈D(dS). By Proposition
7.4, dSΨ ∈D(dS) and d∗
SΨ ∈D(d∗
S). Hence dSΨ, d∗
SΨ ∈D(QS), implying
that QSΨ ∈D(QS).
Hence Ψ ∈D(Q2
S).
Therefore D(∆S) ⊂D(Q2
S).
Thus (7.49) follows. Since ∆S is self-adjoint by Theorem 7.2, we can apply
Lemma 7.13 to conclude that QS is self-adjoint.
(ii) This part follows from an application of Proposition 1.30 with the
case where S is replaced by QS and k = 1, ℓ= 2.
By combining Theorem 7.10 with Theorem 7.3, we obtain the following
result:
Corollary 7.4.
dΓ(S∗S, SS∗) = Q2
S.
(7.50)
Note that, for each p ≥
0, QS maps D(QS) ∩∧p(H , K ) into
∧p−1(H , K ) ⊕∧p+1(H , K ) (∧−1(H , K ) := {0}) and hence it does not
leave ∧p(H , K ) invariant. Therefore operator equality (7.50) gives a non-
trivial factorization of the second quantization operator dΓ(S∗S, SS∗) for
(S∗S, SS∗).
By (7.4), we have the following orthogonal decomposition of the boson-
fermion Fock space F(H , K ):
F(H , K ) =
^
+(H , K ) ⊕
^
−(H , K )
with
^
+(H , K ) :=
∞
M
p=0
^2p
(H , K ),
^
−(H , K ) :=
∞
M
p=0
^2p+1
(H , K ).
Let P± be the orthogonal projections ontoV
±(H , K ) and
Γ := P+ −P−.
(7.51)
Then Γ is a bounded self-adjoint operator. Since
P+ + P−= I,
P+P−= P−P+ = 0,
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
395
it follows that
Γ 2 = I,
Γ ̸= ±I.
Hence Γ is a unitary self-adjoint operator.
It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈F(H , K ),
(P+Ψ)(p) = 1 + (−1)p
2
Ψ(p),
(P−Ψ)(p) = 1 −(−1)p
2
Ψ(p),
p ≥0.
Hence
(ΓΨ)(p) = (−1)pΨ(p),
p ≥0.
(7.52)
Hence, in terms of the fermion number operator Nf, we have
Γ = eiπI⊗Nf,
where the right hand side is deﬁned via the functional calculus for the
function: R ∋λ →eiπλ. Informally or heuristically one may write Γ =
(−1)I⊗Nf.
Theorem 7.11.
(i) The operator Γ
leaves D(QS) invariant and satisﬁes the anti-
commutation relation
{Γ, QS} = 0
on D(QS).
(ii) Operator equality
ΓQSΓ −1 = −QS
(7.53)
holds.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(QS)[= D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S)]. Then, by (7.52), ΓΨ ∈
D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S) = D(QS), implying that ΓD(QS) ⊂D(QS), and
(dSΓΨ)(p) = (−1)p−1dS,p−1Ψ(p−1) = (−1)p−1(dSΨ)(p),
(d∗
SΓΨ)(p) = (−1)p+1d∗
S,pΨ(p+1) = (−1)p+1(d∗
SΨ)(p).
Hence
(QΓΨ)(p) = (−1)p−1(QSΨ)(p) = −(ΓQSΨ)(p).
Thus QΓΨ = −ΓQSΨ.
(ii) Part (i) implies that ΓQS ⊂−QSΓ. Hence ΓQSΓ −1 ⊂−QS. Since
the both sides are self-adjoint, operator equality (7.53) follows.
 

396
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
One can derive from Theorem 7.11 important facts on the spectra of
QS.
We say that a subset Λ of R is symmetric with respect to the origin in
R if {−λ|λ ∈Λ} = Λ.
Theorem 7.12. Let σ#(QS) be one of σ(QS), σp(QS) and σc(QS). Then
σ#(QS) is symmetric with respect to the origin in R.
Moreover, for each λ ∈σp(QS),
dim ker(QS −λ) = dim ker(QS + λ).
(7.54)
Proof. Equation (7.53) means that QS and −QS are unitarily equivalent.
Hence σ#(QS) = σ#(−QS). By this fact and Problem 7 in Chapter 1, we
obtain
σ#(QS) = {−λ|λ ∈σ#(QS)}.
Thus σ#(QS) is symmetric with respect to the origin in R.
Formula (7.54) follows from (7.53) and Theorem 1.7(ii).
7.12
Anti-commutation Relations of QS and QT
In this section we derive a formula for the anti-commutator {QS, QT} of
QS and QT .
Lemma 7.14. Let S, T ∈C(H , K ) such that T ∗S, S∗T , ST ∗and T S∗
are densely deﬁned. Then T ∗S, S∗T , ST ∗and T S∗are closable.
Proof. In general, a densely deﬁned linear operator A from a Hilbert space
to a Hilbert space is closable if and only if D(A∗) is dense.
We have
(T ∗S)∗⊃S∗T . Hence (T ∗S)∗is densely deﬁned. Therefore T ∗S is closable.
Similarly one can show that S∗T , ST ∗and T S∗are closable.
Theorem 7.13. Let S, T ∈C(H , K ) such that T ∗S, S∗T , ST ∗and T S∗
are densely deﬁned.

Proof. (i) Let fj ∈D(T ∗S) ∩D(S∗T ) (j = 1, . . . , n), uk ∈D(ST ∗) ∩
D(T S∗) (k = 1, . . . , m) and

Hence (7.55) holds.
(ii) By (7.10), we have

on Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗S) ∩D(S∗T ))ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(ST ∗) ∩D(T S∗)). Then, by using
the result of (i), we obtain (7.56).
Corollary 7.5. Under the same assumption as in Theorem 7.13, if
T ∗S + S∗T = 0
on D(T ∗S) ∩D(S∗T )
and
ST ∗+ T S∗= 0
on D(ST ∗) ∩D(T S∗) ,
then
{QS, QT } = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗S) ∩D(S∗T ))ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(ST ∗) ∩D(T S∗)).
 

398
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Under the present assumption, we have
dΓb(T ∗S) + dΓb(S∗T ) = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗S) ∩D(S∗T ))
and
dΓf(ST ∗) + dΓf(T S∗) = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(D(ST ∗) ∩D(T S∗)).
Hence (7.56) gives the desired result.
Remark 7.6. If T ∗S+S∗T and ST ∗+T S∗is densely deﬁned and closable,
then Theorem 7.13 implies that
{QS, QT } = dΓb(T ∗S + S∗T ) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(ST ∗+ T S∗)
on Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗S) ∩D(S∗T ))ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(ST ∗) ∩D(T S∗)).
7.13
Abstract Dirac Operator
As one may have noted, the operator QS has very interesting properties.
In fact, there is an abstract structure behind QS. This section is devoted
to description of it.
A Hilbert space H is said to be Z2-graded 8 if it is the direct sum of
mutually orthogonal closed subspaces H± ̸= {0};
H = H+ ⊕H−.
(7.57)
In this case an element in H+ (resp. H−) is called an even (resp. odd)
element.
An everywhere deﬁned linear operator τ on H is called the grading
operator with respect to the orthogonal decomposition (7.57) if, for all
ψ± ∈H±, τψ± = ±ψ±. The operator τ is unique. Indeed, we have
τ = PH+ −PH −,
(7.58)
where PH± are the orthogonal projections onto H±. It follows that τ is a
bounded self-adjoint operator satisfying
τ 2 = I,
τ ̸= ±I.
Hence τ is a unitary self-adjoint operator.
We have
I = PH+ + PH −.
8Z2 denotes the cyclic group of order 2.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
399
Hence
PH+ = 1 + τ
2
,
PH−= 1 −τ
2
.
(7.59)
These are formulae to express the orthogonal projections PH± in terms of
the grading operator τ.
In general, a bounded operator T on H is called an involution if
T 2 = I.
Let T be an involution on H . Then it is easy to prove the following
facts:
(i) T is bijective.
(ii) If T is unitary, then T is self-adjoint.
An involution which is unitary is called a unitary involution.
The operators ±I on H are trivially unitary involutions. A unitary
involution diﬀerent from ±I is called a non-trivial unitary involution.
The above grading operator τ is a non-trivial unitary involution.
Lemma 7.15. Let T be a non-trivial unitary involution on H .
Then
σ(T ) = σp(T ) = {±1} and
H = ker(T −1) ⊕ker(T + 1).
(7.60)
Proof. By the assumption, T is a unitary self-adjoint operator such that
T ̸= ±I. Hence σ(T ) = {±1} = σp(T ). Let ET be the spectral measure of
T . Then supp T = {±1}. Hence I = ET (supp T ) = ET ({1}) + ET ({−1}).
Since RanET ({1}) = ker(T −1) and RanET ({−1}) = ker(T + 1), (7.60)
holds.
This lemma shows that, given a non-trivial unitary involution T on H ,
H is Z2-graded with T being its grading operator.
From the discussions made above, we see that there exists a one-to-
one correspondence between a non-trivial unitary involution on H and a
Z2-grading of H .
We now come to the deﬁnition of an abstract Dirac operator.
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let τ be a non-trivial involution on H and Q be a sym-
metric operator on H . Then Q is called a τ-Dirac operator or a Dirac
operator with respect to τ if τD(Q) ⊂D(Q) and
τQ + Qτ = 0
on D(Q).
 

400
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The concept of τ-Dirac operator uniﬁes concrete operators known as
Dirac type operators. Examples of concrete Dirac type operators can be
found, e.g., in [Thaller (1992)] (see also problems in Section 7.21 below).
Here we only note the following fact, which clariﬁes an essential structure
of QS and justiﬁes the name “Dirac operator” given to it:
Proposition 7.8. The operator Γ deﬁned by (7.51) is a non-trivial unitary
involution and QS is a Γ-Dirac operator.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 7.11.
7.14
Abstract Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
The theory of a τ-Dirac operator may have concrete realizations in various
contexts in physics. Among others, it presents an abstract framework for
supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM). SQM is a class of quan-
tum mechanics with supersymmetry, a symmetry which treats bosons and
fermions on an equal footing in a suitable sense. We mean by SQM not
only SQM with ﬁnite degrees of freedom, but also SQM with inﬁnite de-
grees of freedom, including supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theory (SQFT).
The simplest class of abstract SQM is deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 7.2. A quartet (H , γ, Q, H) consisting of a Hilbert space H ,
a non-trivial unitary involution γ and self-adjoint operators Q, H on H is
called a SQM if it has the following properties:
(SQM.1) H = Q2.
(SQM.2) γQ ⊂−Qγ.
The operators Q and H are called the supercharge and the supersym-
metric Hamiltonian respectively. The operator γ is called the state-sign
operator.9
If ker Q ̸= {0}, then any non-zero vector in ker Q is called a super-
symmetric state.
If ker Q = {0}, then supersymmetry is said to be
spontaneously broken.
9In the physics literature, γ is often called the “fermion number operator” and written
as γ = (−1)F. But this is somewhat confusing, because it is not the fermion number
operator on a fermion Fock space.
In reality, γ accounts the sign of a state of the
quantum system under consideration, i.e., for any bosonic state ψ+, γψ+ = ψ+ and, for
any fermionic state ψ−, γψ−= −ψ−. The name given here for γ is taken from these
reasons.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
401
Remark 7.7. By (SQM.1), ker Q = ker H. Hence a vector is a supersym-
metric state if and only if it is a zero-energy state of the supersymmetric
Hamiltonian H.10
(SQM.1) implies also that H is non-negative:H ≥0.
Hence each zero-energy state of H is a ground state of H.11
It is obvious that the supercharge Q in the above SQM is a γ-Dirac
operator. Hence the theory of self-adjoint τ-Dirac operators includes the
theory of a SQM. The reader should keep this fact in mind in what follows.
Examples of a SQM can be found in [Thaller (1992)].
An important fact in the context of the theory of boson-fermion Fock
spaces is the following:
Theorem 7.14. For all S ∈C(H , K ), (F(H , K ), Γ, QS, dΓ(S∗S, SS∗))
is a SQM.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 7.4 and Theorem 7.11.
Remark 7.8. The SQM (F(H , K ), Γ, QS, dΓ(S∗S, SS∗)) and its pertur-
bations give an abstract uniﬁcation of concrete models in SQFT [Arai (1989,
1992)].
7.15
Fredholm Operators
We continue to study a τ-Dirac operator Q on the Z2-graded Hilbert space
H with the grading operator τ. We show that, if Q is self-adjoint, it has
an index which may be invariant under suitable deformations of it. But,
before doing that, we discuss some general aspects in operator theory.
Let X1 and X2 be Hilbert spaces and T ∈L(X1, X2) be a densely
deﬁned closed operator.
Deﬁnition 7.3. Let nul T = dim ker T and nul T ∗= dim ker T ∗be ﬁnite.
Then one can deﬁne an integer ind T by
ind T := nul T −nul T ∗.
In the case where nul T < ∞(resp. ∞) and nul T ∗= ∞(resp. < ∞), we
set ind T := −∞(resp. ∞). The quantity ind T ∈Z ∪{±∞} is called the
analytical index of T or simply the index of T .
10In general, for a Hamiltonian H (a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space), an eigen-
vector ψ of H with eigenvalue 0 (i.e., Hψ = 0) is called a zero-energy state of H.
11For a Hamiltonian H bounded from below, an eigenvector ψ0 of H with eigenvalue
E0(H) := inf σ(H) (i.e., Hψ0 = E0(H)ψ0) is called a ground state of H.

Remark 7.9. If X1 = X2 and T is self-adjoint with nul T < ∞, then
ind T = 0, since nul T ∗= nul T . Hence ind T can be non-trivial only if T is
not self-adjoint.
Since T is closed, we have T ∗∗= T . Hence
ind T ∗= −ind T.
Suppose that nul T and nul T ∗are ﬁnite.
Then ind T is an integer.
Hence one may expect that ind T is invariant under a “continuous” defor-
mation for T . Namely, if {T (t)|t ∈[0, 1]} is a family of densely deﬁned
closed operators from X1 to X2 such that T (0) = T and the mapping:
t 7→T (t) is continuous in a suitable topology, then it is expected that
ind T (t) = ind T for all t ∈[0, 1]. If we introduce S(t) := T (t) −T , then
T (t) = T + S(t) on D(T ) ∩D(T (t)). Hence the above deformation can be
viewed as a perturbation of T .
Remark 7.10. In general, to a linear operator A ∈L(X1, X2), one can
add another operator B ∈L(X1, X2) to form a new operator A + B ∈
L(X1, X2). In this case, B is called a perturbation of A and A is called
the unperturbed operator. A basic theme of perturbation theory for
linear operators is to investigate what kind of properties of A are carried
over by A + B or not. If a property of A (e.g., closedness, self-adjointness,
spectral property) is continued to hold by A + B, this property is said
to be stable under the perturbation B.
For a systematic development
of perturbation theory for linear operators, see [Kato (1976)]; [Reed and
Simon (1978), Chapter XII].
To state basic results on the stability of ind T under a perturbation for
T , we introduce a special class of closed operators:
Deﬁnition 7.4. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be densely deﬁned and closed.
(i) The operator T is said to be Fredholm if Ran T is closed and nul T <
∞, nul T ∗< ∞.
(ii) The operator T is said to be semi-Fredholm if Ran T is closed and
at least one of nul T and nul T ∗is ﬁnite.
It is obvious from the deﬁnition that a Fredholm operator is semi-
Fredholm. For every Fredholm operator T , ind T is ﬁnite.
An important point of the closedness of the range of a closed operator,
which is part of the properties of a Fredholm operator, lies in the following
fact:
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators

Proposition 7.9. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be closed. Then Ran T is closed if
and only if there exists a contant C > 0 such that
∥T ψ∥≥C∥ψ∥,
ψ ∈(ker T )⊥∩D(T ).
(7.61)
Proof. Suppose that Ran T is closed. Then Ran T is a Hilbert space as a
closed subspace of X2. For each φ ∈Ran T , there exists a vector ψ ∈D(T )
such that T ψ = φ.
By the closedness of T , ker T is a closed subspace.
Hence we have the orthogonal decomposition ψ = ψ0 + ψ⊥
0 with ψ0 ∈ker T
and ψ⊥
0 ∈(ker T )⊥. Hence ψ⊥
0 ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥and φ = T ψ⊥
0 .
Let T ′ := T ↾[(ker T )⊥∩D(T )]. Then T ′ is a bijective linear operator
from D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥to Ran T and T ′−1φ = ψ⊥
0 . Hence T ′−1 is a bijective
linear operator from Ran T to (ker T )⊥∩D(T ).
To prove the closedness of T ′−1 as an operator from Ran T to X1, let
φn ∈Ran T, φn →φ ∈Ran T and T ′−1φn →ψ ∈X1 (n →∞). Then,
putting ψn = T ′−1φn, we have ψn ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥and φn = T ′ψn =
T ψn. Since T is closed, it follows that ψ ∈D(T ) and T ψ = φ. For all
η ∈ker T ,
D
η, T ′−1φn
E
= 0. Hence ⟨η, ψ⟩= limn→∞
D
η, T ′−1φn
E
= 0.
Hence ψ ∈(ker T )⊥. Therefore ψ = T ′−1φ. Thus T ′−1 is closed.
It follows from the result just proved and the closed graph theorem
that T ′−1 is bounded. Namely there exists a constant K > 0 such that
∥T ′−1φ∥≤K∥φ∥, φ ∈Ran T . For each ψ ∈D(T )∩(ker T )⊥, there exists a
vector φ ∈Ran T such that ψ = T ′−1φ. Hence ∥ψ∥≤K∥T ′ψ∥= K∥T ψ∥.
Putting C = K−1, we obtain (7.61).
Suppose that (7.61) holds and let {φn}n ⊂Ran T, φn →φ (n →∞).
Then T ψn = φn for some ψn ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥. Using (7.61), we see that
{ψn}n is a Cauchy sequence in X1. Hence ψ := limn→∞ψn exists. By the
closedness of T , ψ ∈D(T ) and T ψ = φ. Hence φ ∈Ran T . Thus Ran T is
closed.
Proposition 7.9 implies an interesting fact:
Proposition 7.10. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be densely deﬁned and closed. Sup-
pose that Ran T is closed. Then Ran T ∗is closed.
Proof. Suppose that Ran T ∗were not closed. Then, by Proposition 7.9,
there exists a sequence {φn}∞
n=1 ⊂D(T ∗) ∩(ker T ∗)⊥such that ∥φn∥= 1
and T ∗φn →0 (n →∞). By Theorem 1.8(ii), we have
X2 = ker T ∗⊕Ran T,
 

404
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where we have used the fact (T ∗)∗= T and the closedness of Ran T . Hence
(ker T ∗)⊥= Ran T . Hence φn ∈Ran T .
Therfefore there exists a vec-
tor ψn ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥such that φn = T ψn. Hence ∥T ψn∥= 1 and
T ∗T ψn →0 (n →∞). By Proposition 7.9, there exists a constant C > 0
such that ∥T ψn∥≥C∥ψn∥. Hence ∥ψn∥≤1/C. Hence, by the Schwarz
inequality,
∥φn∥2 = ∥T ψn∥2 ≤∥ψn∥∥T ∗T ψn∥≤∥T ∗T ψn∥/C →0 (n →∞).
Hence ∥φn∥→0 (n →∞). But this contradicts the condition ∥φn∥= 1.
Thus Ran T ∗is closed.
The next theorem shows the symmetry of (semi-)Fredholmness under
the conjugate operation: T 7→T ∗:
Theorem 7.15. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be densely deﬁned closed.
(i) If T is Fredholm, then so is T ∗.
(ii) If T is semi-Fredholm, then so is T ∗.
Proof. In both cases (i) and (ii), we need only to show that Ran T ∗is
closed. But this follows from Proposition 7.10.
A generalization of the concept of compact operator is given as follows:
Deﬁnition 7.5. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and S, T ∈L(X , Y ).
Then S is said to be relatively compact with respect to T or T -
compact if D(T ) ⊂D(S) and, for every bounded sequence {ψn}∞
n=1 in
D(T ) such that the sequence {T ψn}∞
n=1 is bounded, {Sψn}∞
n=1 contains a
convergent subsequence.
The next theorem is a basic fact on the stability of Fredholmness and
analytical index under a perturbation:
Theorem 7.16. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be Fredholm (resp. semi-Fredholm)
and S ∈L(X1, X2) be a T -compact operator. Then T + S is Fredholm
(resp. semi-Fredholm) and ind (T + S) = ind T .
Since the proof of this theorem requires lengthy arguments, we omit it.
For a proof of Theorem 7.16, see, e.g., [Kato (1976), Chapter IV, Theorem
5.26].

Operator Matrix Representation of a τ-Dirac
Operator
Let H be a Z2-graded Hilbert space such that the orthogonal decomposi-
tion (7.57) holds and τ be the grading operator associated with (7.57) (see
(7.58)).
According to the orthogonal decomposition (7.57), H has a represen-
tation by column vectors:
H =
ψ
φ
 ψ ∈H+, φ ∈H−

,
(7.62)
where we identify
ψ
0

(resp.
 0
φ

) with ψ ∈H+ (resp. φ ∈H−).
Let L be a linear operator on H and D±(L) := D(L) ∩H±. Then,
corresponding to the representation (7.62),
Lr := L ↾D+(L) ⊕D−(L),
the restriction of L to D+(L) ⊕D−(L) ⊂D(L), has the operator matrix
representation
Lr =
 L++ L+−
L−+ L−−

,
where Lab ∈L(Hb, Ha), a, b = ± with D(Lab) = Db(L) and
Labψb = (Lψb)a,
ψb ∈Db(L).
This operator matrix representation for Lr is unique. We remark that, if
L ∈B(H ), then Lr = L. But, in general, Lr ⊂L. For a general theory of
operator matrices, see Appendix B.
It is easy to see that
τ =
I 0
0 −I

.
Let Q be a τ-Dirac operator.
Lemma 7.16. The operator Q maps D±(Q) = D(Q) ∩H± to H∓, i.e., Q
maps each even (resp. odd) element in its domain to an odd (resp. even)
element.
Proof. Let ψ ∈D+(Q). Then τψ = ψ. Hence Qτψ = Qψ. The left hand
side is equal to −τQψ. Hence τ(Qψ) = −Qψ, i.e., Qψ ∈H−. Similarly
one can show that, for all φ ∈D−(Q), Qφ ∈H+.
 

406
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 7.17. There exists a unique pair (Q+, Q−) consisting of densely
deﬁned linear operators Q± from H± to H∓such that D(Q±) = D(Q)∩H±
and
Q =
 0 Q−
Q+
0

.
(7.63)
Moreover, the following (i) and (ii) hold:
(i) Q∗
−⊃Q+ and Q∗
+ ⊃Q−.
(ii) Q is closed if and only if Q± are closed.
Proof. By (7.59), we have
PH±D(Q) ⊂D(Q)
and
QPH±ψ = PH∓Qψ,
ψ ∈D(Q).
Hence
D+(Q) ⊕D−(Q) = D(Q).
Therefore Qr = Q. By Lemma 7.16, for all ψ+ ∈D+(Q), (Qψ+)+ = 0,
i.e., Q++ = 0 on D+(Q). Similarly Q−−= 0 on D−(Q). Hence, putting
Q−:= Q+−and Q+ := Q−+, we obtain (7.63).
In the present case, PH±D(Q) = D(Q±) as pointed above.
Hence
D(Q±) are dense in H± respectively.
(i) By Theorem B.1(i) in Appendix B, we have
Q∗=
 0 Q∗
+
Q∗
−
0

.
(7.64)
Since Q is symmetric, Q∗⊃Q. Hence Q∗
+ ⊃Q−and Q∗
−⊃Q+.
(ii) Suppose that Q is closed. Let ψn ∈D(Q+) and ψn →ψ ∈H+,
Q+ψn →φ ∈H−(n →∞). Then Qψn →φ (n →∞). Hence ψ ∈D(Q)
and φ = Qψ. This means that ψ ∈D+(Q) = D(Q+) and Q+ψ = φ. Thus
Q+ is closed. Similarly one can show that Q−is closed.
Conversely suppose that Q± are closed. Let ψn = (ψn+, ψn−) ∈D(Q)
be such that ψn →ψ ∈H and Qψn →φ ∈H (n →∞). Then ψn± ∈
D(Q±) and
ψn± →ψ±, Q−ψn−→φ+, Q+ψn+ →φ−(n →∞).
Hence ψ± ∈D(Q±) and Q±ψ± = φ∓. Therefore ψ ∈D(Q) and Qψ = φ.
Thus Q is closed.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
407
With regard to Fredholmness of Q±, we have the following fact:
Lemma 7.18. The operator Q± are (semi-) Fredholm if and only if Q is
(semi-) Fredholm.
Proof. The equivalence on closedness between Q± and Q follows Lemma
7.17(ii). As is easily seen, we have
ker Q = ker Q+ ⊕ker Q−,
ker Q∗= ker Q∗
−⊕ker Q∗
+.
Hence “nul Q < ∞, nul Q∗< ∞” is equivalent to “nul Q± < ∞, nul Q∗
± <
∞”. By direct computations, we have
∥Qψ∥2 = ∥Q+ψ+∥2 + ∥Q−ψ−∥2,
ψ = (ψ+, ψ−) ∈D(Q).
(7.65)
Now suppose that Q is Fredholm. Then Ran Q is closed and nul Q <
∞, nul Q∗< ∞.
Hence, as remarked above, we have nul Q± < ∞and
nul Q∗
± < ∞. By the closedness of Ran Q and Proposition 7.9, there exists
a constant C > 0 such that
∥Qψ∥≥C∥ψ∥,
ψ ∈(ker Q)⊥∩D(Q).
By this estimate and (7.65), we obtain
∥Q±ψ±∥≥C∥ψ±∥,
ψ± ∈D(Q±) ∩(ker Q±)⊥.
By Proposition 7.9 again, this means that Ran Q± are closed. Thus Q± are
Fredholm.
Next suppose that Q± are Fredholm.
Then Ran Q± are closed and
nul Q± < ∞, nul Q∗
± < ∞. Hence nul Q < ∞and nul Q∗< ∞. Moreover
Ran Q = Ran Q−⊕Ran Q+, which implies that Ran Q is closed. Thus Q
is Fredholm.
Similarly we can prove the statement on the semi-Fredholmness.
With regard to relative compactness of a τ-Dirac operator with Q, we
have the following fact:
Lemma 7.19. Let V be a τ-Dirac operator. Then V is Q-compact if and
only if Va is Qa-compact for a = ±.
Proof. Suppose that V is Q-compact. Let {ψn+}n ⊂D(Q+) be a bounded
sequence such that {Q+ψn+}n is bounded. Let ψn := (ψn+, 0). Then ψn ∈
D(Q) and {ψn}n is bounded.
Also we have {Qψn}n = {(0, Q+ψn+)}n.
Hence {Qψn}n is bounded. Therefore, by the Q-compactness of V , there
exists a subsequence {ψnk}k of {ψn}n such that {V ψnk}k converges. We
 

408
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
have V ψn = (0, V+ψn+).
Hence {V+ψnk}k converges. Thus V+ is Q+-
compact.
Similarly one can prove the Q−-compactness of V−.
Conversely suppose that Va is Qa-compact for a = ±. Let {ψn}n ⊂
D(Q) be a bounded sequence such that {Qψn}n is bounded. Let ψn =
(ψn+, ψn−).
Then ψn± ∈D(Q±) and {ψn±}n are bounded.
Also we
have {Qψn}n = {(Qn−ψn−, Q+ψn+)}n.
Hence {Qψn±}n are bounded.
Therefore, by the Qa-compactness of Va (a = ±), there exists a subse-
quence {ψnk±}k of {ψn±}n such that {Vaψnka}k (a = ±) converges. Hence
{V ψnk}k converges. Thus V is Q-compact.
7.17
Self-adjoint τ-Dirac Operators
In this section we consider the case where the τ-Dirac operator Q is self-
adjoint.
Lemma 7.20. Let Q be self-adjoint. Then Q+ is a densely deﬁned closed
operator from H+ to H−and
Q =
 0 Q∗
+
Q+
0

.
(7.66)
Proof. By the self-adjointness of Q and (7.64), we have Q∗
+ = Q−. Hence
(7.66) holds.
Deﬁnition 7.6. Let Q be self-adjoint and suppose that at least one of
nul Q+ and nul Q∗
+ is ﬁnite. Then we deﬁne indτ Q ∈Z ∪{±∞} by
indτ Q := ind Q+ = nul Q+ −nul Q∗
+.
We call indτ Q the τ-index of Q.
Remark 7.11. As is seen from the deﬁnition, the concept of τ-index indτ Q
is diﬀerent from that of the index ind Q. If Q is self-adjoint and nul Q < ∞,
then ind Q = 0 (Remark 7.9), but indτ Q is not necessarily zero.
Let us examine the stability of indτ Q under perturbations for Q. For
this purpose, we need two lemmas:
Lemma 7.21. Let T be a compact operator from a Hilbert space X1 to a
Hilbert space X2 and Sn ∈B(Y , X1), n ∈N (Y is a Hilbert space) such
that s- limn→∞S∗
n = 0. Then limn→∞∥T Sn∥= 0.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
409
Proof. We have ∥T Sn∥= ∥(T Sn)∗∥= ∥S∗
nT ∗∥. There exists a sequence
{φk}k in X2 such that ∥φk∥= 1, k ∈N and limk→∞∥S∗
nT ∗φk∥= ∥S∗
nT ∗∥.
Since T ∗is compact (which follows from the compactness of T ), there exists
a subsequence {φnℓ}ℓand a vector ψ ∈X1 such that limℓ→∞T ∗φnℓ= ψ.
Hence ∥S∗
nψ∥= ∥S∗
nT ∗∥.
But, by the present assumption, ∥S∗
nψ∥→0
(n →∞). Thus limn→∞∥S∗
nT ∗∥= 0.
The next lemma shows the stability of self-adjointness of an operator
under relatively compact perturbations:
Lemma 7.22. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space X and
B be a A-compact symmetric operator on X . Then B is inﬁnitesimally
small with respect to A. In particular, A + B is self-adjoint.
Proof. Let {ψn}n be a bounded sequence in X and φn := (A −z)−1ψn
(z ∈C \ R). Then φn ∈D(A) with ∥φn∥≤|Im z|−1∥ψn∥and
∥Aφn∥= ∥ψn + z(A −z)−1ψn∥≤∥ψn∥+ |z| |Im z|−1∥ψn∥.
Hence {φn}n and {Aφn}n are bounded. Therefore, by the A-compactness of
B, {Bφn}n contains a convergent subsequence. Since Bφn = B(A−z)−1ψn,
it follows that B(A −z)−1 is compact.
For each n ∈N, we can write B(A−in)−1 = T Sn with T := B(A−i)−1
and Sn := (A−i)(A−in)−1. By the preceding result, T is compact. By the
functional calculus, Sn is bounded and S∗
n = (A + i)(A + in)−1. Using the
spectral representation for S∗
n, one can show that s- limn→∞S∗
n = 0. Hence,
by Lemma 7.21, ∥T Sn∥→0 (n →∞). Hence limn→∞∥B(A −in−1∥= 0.
This means that, for every ε > 0, there exists an n0(ε) ∈N such that, for
all n ≥n0(ε), ∥B(A −in)−1∥< ε. Hence, for all ψ ∈D(A),
∥Bψ∥≤ε∥(A −in0(ε))ψ∥≤ε∥Aψ∥+ bε∥ψ∥,
where bε := εn0(ε). Hence B is inﬁnitesimally small with respect to A.
Therefore, by the Kato-Rellich theorem (Theorem 1.14), A + B is self-
adjoint.
Now we can prove a basic stability theorem for the τ-index of a self-
adjoint τ-Dirac operator:
Theorem 7.17. Let Q be a self-adjoint τ-Dirac operator and Fredholm
(resp. semi-Fredholm). Suppose that V is a τ-Dirac operator which is Q-
compact. Then Q + V is a self-adjoint τ-Dirac operator with D(Q + V ) =
D(Q) and Fredholm (resp. semi-Fredholm). Moreover
indτ (Q + V ) = indτ Q.
(7.67)
 

410
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let Q be Fredholm (resp. semi-Fredholm). The self-adjointness of
Q + V follows from an application of Lemma 7.22. It is easy to see that
Q + V is a τ-Dirac operator. Applying Theorem 7.16, we see that Q + V
is Fredholm (resp. semi-Fredholm). Hence, by Lemma 7.18, (Q + V )+ =
Q+ + V+ is Fredholm (resp. semi-Fredholm). By Lemma 7.19, V+ is Q+-
compact. Hence, by Theorem 7.16 again, ind (Q + V )+ = ind Q+. Thus
(7.67) holds.
7.18
Index Formula
In this section we derive a general formula for the τ-index of a self-adjoint
τ-Dirac operator. For this purpose, we ﬁrst present some lemmas.
Lemma 7.23. Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator from a Hilbert
space X to a Hilbert space Y . Suppose that σp(T ∗T ) \ {0} ̸= ∅and E ∈
σp(T ∗T ) \ {0} (hence E > 0). Then there exists a unitary operator UE :
ker(T ∗T −E) →ker(T T ∗−E) such that
UEψ =
1
√
E
T ψ,
ψ ∈ker(T ∗T −E).
(7.68)
In particular,
dim ker(T ∗T −E) = dim ker(T T ∗−E),
E ∈σp(T ∗T ) \ {0}
(7.69)
and
σp(T ∗T ) \ {0} = σp(T T ∗) \ {0}.
(7.70)
Proof. Let UE : ker(T ∗T −E) →X be deﬁned by (7.68). Then, for all
ψ ∈ker(T ∗T −E), UEψ ∈D(T ∗) and T ∗UEψ =
√
Eψ. Hence T ∗UEψ ∈
D(T ) and T T ∗UEψ =
√
ET ψ = EUEψ.
Hence UEψ ∈ker(T T ∗−E).
Using T ∗T ψ = Eψ, we have
∥UEψ∥2 = ⟨T ψ, T ψ⟩
E
= ⟨ψ, T ∗T ψ⟩
E
= ∥ψ∥2.
Hence UE preserves the inner product.
For each φ ∈ker(T T ∗−E), the vector ψ := T ∗φ/
√
E is in D(T )
and T ψ =
√
Eφ · · · (∗).
Hence T ψ ∈D(T ∗) and T ∗T ψ = Eψ, i.e.,
ψ ∈ker(T ∗T −E).
By this fact and (∗), we obtain φ = UEψ.
Hence
Ran(UE) = ker(T T ∗−E). Thus UE is a unitary operator from ker(T ∗T −E)
to ker(T T ∗−E). This implies (7.69) and (7.70).

Remark 7.12. Equation (7.70) extends to the spectrum of T ∗T and T T ∗:
σ(T ∗T ) \ {0} = σ(T T ∗) \ {0}.
(7.71)
This fact is called Deift’s theorem.12 Properties (7.70) and (7.71) are
called the spectral supersymmetry of a densely deﬁned closed operator
T .
Lemma 7.24. Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator from a Hilbert
space X to a Hilbert space Y such that inf σ(|T |)\{0} > 0.13 Then Ran T
is closed.
Proof. Let T = U|T | be the polar decomposition14 of T so that D(T ) =
D(|T |) and U : (ker T )⊥→Ran T is a partial isometry. Let δ := inf σ(|T |)\
{0} and E|T | be the spectral measure of |T |. Then, for all ψ ∈D(T ) ∩
(ker T )⊥= D(|T |) ∩(ker |T |)⊥,
∥T ψ∥2 = ∥|T |ψ∥2 =
Z
[δ,∞)
|λ|2d∥E|T |(λ)ψ∥2
≥δ2∥E|T |([δ, ∞))ψ∥2 = δ2∥E|T |({0} ∪[δ, ∞))ψ∥2
= δ2∥ψ∥2,
where we have used that E|T |({0})ψ = 0. Hence, by Proposition 7.9, Ran T
is closed.
We recall some basic properties of a trace class operator (Subsection
1.3.9).
Lemma 7.25. Let T be trace class on a Hilbert space X .
Then T is
compact and P∞
n=1 λn < ∞, where λn’s are the singular values of T (i.e.,
the eigenvalues of |T |).
Proof. Proof of this lemma can be found in textbooks on Hilbert space
theory, e.g., [Kato (1967), §49] and [Reed and Simon (1980), Theorem
VI.21].
Let Aj (j = 1, 2) be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space Hj and
A := A1 ⊕A2 be the direct sum of A1 and A2 on H1 ⊕H2. Then, by
Theorem 4.2(vi), A is self-adjoint.
Lemma 7.26. Let A1, A2 and A be as above and Ej be the spectral measure
of Aj (j = 1, 2). Then:
12For a proof, see. e.g., [Arai (2006b), Theorem 9.8].
13Recall that |T| := (T ∗T)1/2.
14See, e.g., §VIII.9 in [Reed and Simon (1980)].

(i) For each Borel set J ⊂R, the operator (E1 ⊕E2)(J) on H1 ⊕H2
deﬁned by
(E1 ⊕E2)(J) := E1(J) ⊕E2(J)
is an orthogonal projection and (E1 ⊕E2)(·) is the spectral measure of

(ii) For all Borel measurable function f on R,
f(A) = f(A1) ⊕f(A2).
Proof. It follows from the deﬁnition of A that A is reduced by each Hj
and the reduced part of A to Hj is equal to Aj. Hence part (i) follows from
an application of Theorem 1.38(ix). Part (ii) is due to Theorem 1.40.
We now come to the main theorem in this section:
Theorem 7.18. Let Q be a self-adjoint τ-Dirac operator on a Hilbert space
H . Suppose that, for some t > 0, e−tQ2 is trace class. Then Q is Fredholm
and
indτ (Q) = Tr τe−tQ2
(7.72)
independently of t.
Proof. By Lemma 7.20 and Theorem B.2, we have
Q2 =
 Q∗
+Q+
0
0
Q+Q∗
+

= Q∗
+Q+ ⊕Q+Q∗
+.
(7.73)
Applying Lemma 7.26 with A1 = Q∗
+Q+ and A2 = Q+Q∗
+, we obtain
e−tQ2 =
 e−tQ∗
+Q+
0
0
e−tQ+Q∗
+

.
By this equation and the present assumption, e−tQ∗
+Q+ and e−tQ+Q∗
+ are
trace class and non-negative self-adjoint. Since a trace class operator is
compact by Lemma 7.25, σ(e−tQ∗
+Q+) \ {0} consists of only discrete eigen-
values (Lemma 1.2). By the spectral mapping theorem, σ(Q∗
+Q+) \ {0}
consists of only discrete eigenvalues. Let σ(Q∗
+Q+) \ {0} = {En}∞
n=1 with
0 < E1 < E2 < · · · and mn be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue En. Then,
by Lemma 7.23,
σ(Q+Q∗
+) \ {0} = {En}∞
n=1
with dim ker(Q+Q∗
+ −En) = mn.

If ker Q∗
+Q+ ̸= {0}, then e−t·0 = 1 is an eigenvalue of e−tQ∗
+Q+ which
has a ﬁnite multiplicity. Hence dim ker Q∗
+Q+ < ∞. Hence nul Q+ < ∞.
Similarly one can show that nul Q∗
+ < ∞.
Equation (7.73) means that |Q|2 = |Q+|2 ⊕|Q∗
+|2. Hence, by the func-
tional calculus for direct sums of self-adjoint operators (cf. Theorem 1.40),
|Q| = |Q+| ⊕|Q∗
+|. Hence
σ(|Q|) \ {0} = {
p
En}∞
n=1,
implying that inf σ(|Q|) \ {0} = √E1 > 0. Hence, by Lemma 7.24, RanQ
is closed. Thus Q is Fredholm.
It is easy to see that
τe−tQ2 =
 e−tQ∗
+Q+
0
0
−e−tQ+Q∗

.
Hence
Tr τe−tQ2 = Tr e−tQ∗

Thus (7.72) holds.
Remark 7.13. If, for some t > 0, e−tQ2 is trace class, then, for all s > t,
e−sQ2 is trace class. This is proved as follows: By functional calculus, one
has e−sQ2 = Se−tQ2 with S := e−(s−t)Q2. Since S is bounded, it follows
from Proposition 1.14 that Se−tQ2 is trace class.
7.19
Fredholmness and the Γ -index of the Dirac operator
QS
We now come back to the boson-fermion Fock space F(H , K ). As we
have seen, the operator QS introduced in Section 7.11 is a self-adjoint Γ-
Dirac operator. Hence it is natural to ask if it is Fredholm and what the
Γ-index of QS is like. We have the following results.
Theorem 7.19.
(i) If S is Fredholm and nul S = 0, then QS is Fredholm and
indΓ QS = δ0,nul S∗.
(7.74)
 

414
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) If S is semi-Fredholm with nul S ≥1 and nul S∗= 0, then QS is
semi-Fredholm and
indΓ QS = ∞.
(7.75)
(iii) If nul S = 0 and nul S∗= ∞, then QS is not semi-Fredholm.
(iv) If nul S ≥1 and nul S∗≥1, then QS is not semi-Fredholm.
To prove this theorem, we present a lemma.
Lemma 7.27. The range Ran(S) is closed if and only
inf σ(S∗S) \ {0} > 0.
(7.76)
Proof. Suppose that Ran(S) is closed. Then, by Proposition 7.9, there
exists a constant C > 0 such that, for all ψ ∈D(S) ∩(ker S)⊥, ∥Sψ∥≥
C∥ψ∥. We have ker S∗S = ker S and hence (ker S)⊥= (ker S∗S)⊥. Hence,
for all ψ ∈D(S∗S) ∩(ker S∗S)⊥, C2∥ψ∥2 ≤∥Sψ∥2 = ⟨ψ, S∗Sψ⟩. This
means that σ(S∗S) \ {0} ⊂[C2, ∞). Hence (7.76) holds.
Conversely, assume (7.76) and let c := inf σ(S∗S) \ {0}.
Then, us-
ing the fact that |S|2 = S∗S and the spectral mapping theorem, σ(|S|) \
{0} ⊂[√c, ∞). It follows from functional calculus and the fact ∥Sψ∥=
∥|S| ψ∥, ψ ∈D(S) = D(|S|) that ∥Sψ∥≥√c∥ψ∥, ψ ∈D(S) ∩(ker S)⊥.
Hence, by Proposition 7.9, Ran(S) is closed.
Proof of Theorem 7.19
Let QS,+ := Q ↾D(Q) ∩V
+(H , K ). Then
QS =

0
Q∗
S,+
QS,+
0

.
Hence
Q2
S =
 Q∗
S,+QS,+
0
0
QS,+Q∗
S,+

.
By this fact and Theorem 7.2, we have
Q∗
S,+QS,+ = ⊕∞
p=0∆S,2p,
QS,+Q∗
S,+ = ⊕∞
p=0∆S,2p+1.
Hence
ker QS,+ = ⊕∞
p=0 ker ∆S,2p,
ker Q∗
S,+ = ⊕∞
p=0 ker ∆S,2p+1.
These imply the following:
nul QS,+ =
∞
X
p=0
nul ∆S,2p,
nul Q∗
S,+ =
∞
X
p=0
nul ∆S,2p+1.
(7.77)
(i) Let S be Fredholm with nul S = 0. Then n := nul S∗< ∞. We ﬁrst
prove (7.74) according to the value of n.
 

Boson-Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite Dimensional Dirac Type Operators
415
(a) The case n = 0
In this case, by Theorem 7.9 and (7.77), we have nul QS,+ = 1 and
nul Q∗
S,+ = 0. Hence indΓ QS = 1.
(b) The case n ≥1
By Theorem 7.9 and (7.77), we have
nul QS,+ =
X
2p≤n
nC2p < ∞,
nul Q∗
S,+ =
X
2p+1≤n
nC2p+1 < ∞.
Hence
indΓ QS =
n
X
p=0
nCp(−1)p = (1 + (−1))n = 0.
Thus (7.74) holds.
We next prove the Fredholmness of QS. By the Fredholmness of S,
Ran S is closed. Hence, by Lemma 7.27,
δ1 := inf σ(S∗S) \ {0} > 0.
Since S∗also is Fredholm, we have similarly
δ2 := inf σ(SS∗) \ {0} > 0.
Let δ := min{δ1, δ2} > 0. Then, by the spectral property of second quanti-
zation operators,
inf σ(∆S,p) \ {0} ≥δ > 0,
p ≥0.
Hence
inf σ(Q∗
S,+QS,+) \ {0} ≥δ > 0,
inf σ(QS,+Q∗
S,+) \ {0} ≥δ > 0.
Hence, by Lemma 7.27, Ran(QS,+) and Ran(Q∗
S,+) are closed. Therefore
QS,+ is Fredholm. Thus, by Lemma 7.18, QS is Fredholm.
(ii) Let S be semi-Fredholm with nul S ≥1 and nul S∗= 0. Then, by
Theorem 7.8, for all p ≥1, ker ∆S,p = {0}. Hence nul QS,+ = nul ∆S,0,
nul Q∗
S,+ = 0. By Theorem 7.9, nul ∆S,0 = ∞. Thus (7.75) holds.
The semi-Fredholmness of QS can be proved in the same wasy as in (i).
(iii) Let nul S = 0 and nul S∗= ∞. Then, by the proof of (i), nul QS,+ =
∞and nul Q∗
S,+ = ∞. Hence QS,+ is not semi-Fredholm. Thus QS is not
semi-Fredholm.
(iv) Let nul S ≥1 and nul S∗≥1. Then, in the same way as in the
poof of (iii), we have nul QS,+ = ∞and nul Q∗
S,+ = ∞. Hence QS,+ is not
semi-Fredholm. Thus QS is not semi-Fredholm.

compact. Then QS+V is a self-adjoint Γ-Dirac operator with D(QS+V ) =

Notes
The main contents of this chapter are taken from [Arai (1989, 1992)]. In
these articles, a class of perturbations V for the Dirac operator QS such
that QS(V ) := QS + V is essentially self-adjoint is considered (V is not
necessarily relatively compact with respect to QS) and a functional integral
representation for the index indΓ QS(V ) is established. A study on essential
self-adjointness of QS(V ) is made in [Arai (1994)]. It is shown in [Arai
(1992)] that the SQM (F(H , K ), Γ, QS(V ), H) with H := QS(V )
2 gives
a uniﬁcation of some models in SQFT. For a piece of recent work on QS(V ),

Chapter 8
General Theory of Quantum Fields
General mathematical aspects of quantum ﬁeld theory are described.
8.1
Introduction
From this chapter, we discuss mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds. As
mentioned in the Preface of this book, there are two approaches to study
quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) mathematically, namely, axiomatic approach
and constructive one. In this chapter we ﬁrst look at what axiomatic QFT
is like brieﬂy. But, as for axiomatic QFT, we restrict ourselves to giving
a minimum that a beginner in mathematical QFT should know, since the
present book is mainly intended to give mathematical bases for constructive
approach in QFT.
A standard heuristic approach to obtain a notion of quantum ﬁeld is
to apply the canonical quantization scheme to a classical ﬁeld as is usually
done in textbooks on QFT in physics. From the view-point which regards
QFT as a fundamental theory in physics, however, the concept of a quantum
ﬁeld (if it exists) should be found as one independent of classical ﬁelds. In
the framework of such a QFT, a classical ﬁeld should be positioned as a
classical limit of a quantum ﬁeld where the reduced Planck constant (the
Dirac constant) ℏtends to 0 in a suitable sense. The purpose of this chapter
is to deﬁne a general concept of quantum ﬁeld in the sense just mentioned
and to investigate its basic properties.

Operator-valued Distributions
8.2.1
Operator-valued functions
Let F be a Hilbert space and L(F) be the space of linear operators on F
(see Subsection 1.1.1).
A mapping A : Rd →L(F); Rd ∋x 7→A(x) ∈L(F) is called an
operator-valued function on Rd with values in L(F).
Example 8.1. Let fj : Rd →C (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N) and Aj ∈L(F).
Then A : Rd →L(F) deﬁned by A(x) := Pn
j=1 fj(x)Aj, x ∈Rd is an
operator-valued function on Rd.
Example 8.2. Let (A1, . . . , Ad) be a d-tuple of self-adjoint operators on
F. Then U : Rd →B(F) (the Banach space of bounded linear operators
on F) deﬁned by U(x) = eix1A1 · · · eixdAd, x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈Rd is an
operator-valued function on Rd. Note that, for all x ∈Rd, U(x) is unitary.
8.2.2
Operator-valued distributions
We can also deﬁne an operator-valued functional as an extension of the
concept of operator-valued function.
Let V be a complex vector space.
Then a mapping φ : V →L(F);V
∋v 7→φ(v) ∈L(F) is called an
operator-valued functional on V with values in L(F).
We denote by S (Rd) the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions
on Rd (see Appendix D).
Example 8.3. Let A : Rd →L(F) be an operator-valued function such
that, for all x ∈Rd, A(x) ∈B(F) and A is Borel measurable with
Z
Rd |f(x)| ∥A(x)Ψ∥dx < ∞,
f ∈S (Rd), Ψ ∈F.
For each f ∈S (Rd), one can deﬁne a linear operator φA(f) on F as
follows:
D(φA(f)) :=

Ψ ∈F|
Z
Rd |f(x)| ∥A(x)Ψ∥dx < ∞

,
φA(f)Ψ :=
Z
Rd f(x)A(x)Ψdx,
Ψ ∈D(φA(f)),
where the integral on the right hand side is taken in the sense of Bochner
integral (see Appendix E). The mapping φA : f 7→φA(f) is an operator-
valued functional on S (Rd) with values in L(F).
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
427
In analogy with the case of usual functions and distributions (see Ap-
pendix D), the concept of operator-valued function can be extended to a
concept of operator-valued distribution:
Deﬁnition 8.1. Let d ∈N and D be a dense subspace in F. A mapping
ϕ : S (Rd) →L(F); S (Rd) ∋f 7→ϕ(f) ∈L(F) is called an operator-
valued distribution on Rd with values in L(F) if the following (ϕ.1)–
(ϕ.3) hold:
(ϕ.1) For all f ∈S (Rd), ϕ(f) is densely deﬁned with D ⊂D(ϕ(f)) ∩
D(ϕ(f)∗).
(ϕ.2) (linearity in test functions) For all f, g ∈S (Rd) and α, β ∈C,
ϕ(αf + βg) = αϕ(f) + βϕ(g)
on D.
(ϕ.3) (continuity) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D, the correspondence:S (Rd) ∋f 7→
⟨Ψ, ϕ(f)Φ⟩is continuous in S (Rd).
Namely, the linear functional
FΨ,Φ : S (Rd) →C deﬁned by FΨ,Φ(f) := ⟨Ψ, ϕ(f)Φ⟩, f ∈S (Rd)
is a tempered distribution on Rd: FΨ,Φ ∈S ′(Rd).
The subspace D is called a common domain of ϕ.
We denote by S ′(Rd, L(F)) the set of operator-valued distributions
on Rd with values in L(F).
Remark 8.1. In Deﬁnition 8.1, one can replace S (Rd) by D(Rd), the
space of test functions with compact support (see Appendix D). In this
case FΨ,Φ ∈D′(Rd). But, in this book, we consider only operator-valued
distributions in the above sense.
Remark 8.2. By condition (ϕ.1), D(ϕ(f)∗) is dense. Hence ϕ(f) is clos-
able.
Let ϕ1 and ϕ2 be in S ′(Rd, L(F)) with common domains D1 and D2
respectively and D be a subspace of F such that D ⊂D1 ∩D2. Then
we say that ϕ1 is equal to ϕ2 on D if, for all Ψ ∈D and f ∈S (Rd),
ϕ1(f)Ψ = ϕ2(f)Ψ. In this case we write “ϕ1 = ϕ2 on D”.
As in the case of usual distributions, for an operator-valued distribution
ϕ, a ﬁctitious symbol ϕ(x) is sometimes used in the form
ϕ(f) =
Z
Rd ϕ(x)f(x)dx.
The symbol ϕ(x) is called the operator-valued distribution kernel of
ϕ. In reference to this form, one says that ϕ(f) is obtained by “smearing”

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
ϕ(x) with f. But this expression can have a meaning only if ϕ(x) is an
operator-valued function on Rd with suitable properties.
Example 8.4. Let S1, . . . , Sn (n ∈N) be densely deﬁned closed operators
on F and φ1, . . . , φn ∈S ′(Rd). Suppose that there exists a dense subspace
D such that D ⊂∩n
j=1D(Sj) ∩D(S∗
j ). Then the mapping ϕ : S (Rd) →
L(F) deﬁned by
ϕ(f) :=
n
X
j=1
φj(f)Sj,
f ∈S (Rd)
is in S ′(Rd, L(F)).
Note that, if n = 1 and S1 = I (identity), then ϕ(f) = φ1(f) ( a scalar
multiplication operator). Hence each element in S ′(Rd) can be regarded
as a special case of operator-valued distributions on Rd.
Example 8.5. Let us consider the case where F = Fb(L2(Rd)), the boson
Fock space over L2(Rd) (see Chapter 5). We denote by a(f) the boson
annihilation operator on Fb(L2(Rd)) with test vector f ∈L2(Rd). Let Nb
be the boson number operator on Fb(L2(Rd)). Then, as we have seen in
Chapter 5, D(N 1/2

∥a(f)∗Ψ∥≤∥f∥∥(Nb + 1)1/2Ψ∥, Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

(8.2)
We denote by f ∗the complex conjugate of f. It is easy to see that, for all
Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), a(f ∗)Ψ is linear in f ∈L2(Rd). Moreover, for all Ψ, Φ ∈
D(N 1/2

Hence, if fn
S
−→f (n →∞) (fn, f ∈S (Rd)), then limn→∞⟨Ψ, a(f ∗
n)Φ⟩=
⟨Ψ, a(f ∗)Φ⟩. Therefore S (Rd) ∋f 7→⟨Ψ, a(f ∗)Φ⟩is a tempered distri-
bution on Rd. Thus the mapping : f 7→a(f ∗) is an operator-valued dis-
tribution on Rd with values in L(Fb(L2(Rd))) and D(N 1/2
b
) is a common
domain of this operator-valued distribution.
Similarly one can show that the mapping f 7→a(f)∗(the boson creation
operator with test vector f ∈S (Rd)) is in S ′(Rd, Fb(L2(Rd)) with a
common domain D(N 1/2
b
).
8.2.3
Transformations of operator-valued distributions
Let ϕ ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)) with a common domain D and T be a continuous
linear mapping on S (Rd). Then one can deﬁne a mapping ϕT : S (Rd) →
L(F) by
ϕT (f) := ϕ(T f),
f ∈S (Rd).
(8.3)
Then it is easy to see that ϕT ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)).
We call ϕT the T -
transform of ϕ. If there exists a unitary operator U on F such that
Uϕ(f)U −1 = ϕT (f) = ϕ(T f),
f ∈S (Rd),
then ϕT is unitarily implementable by U.
One can also consider the case where T is a continuous anti-linear map-
ping on S (Rd). In this case too, ϕT (f) is deﬁned by (8.3). But, in this
case, by the anti-linearity of T , the mapping:f 7→ϕT (f)∗is an operator-
valued distribution on Rd. If there exists an anti-unitary operator1 U ′ on
F such that
U ′ϕ(f)U ′−1 = ϕ(T f),
f ∈S (Rd),
then ϕT is anti-unitarily implementable by U ′.
8.2.4
Partial derivatives of operator-valued distributions
Let ϕ ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)) with a common domain D. Then, for each multi-
index α ∈Zd
+, one can deﬁne a mapping Dαϕ : S (Rd) →L(F) by
(Dαϕ)(f) = (−1)|α|ϕ(∂αf),
f ∈S (Rd).
Then, as in the case of usual distributions (see Section D.1.4 in Appendix
D), one can see that Dαϕ ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)) with D being a common domain.
1See Section 4.9.
 

430
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We call the operator-valued distribution Dαϕ a partial derivative of ϕ
of order |α|.
For a non-negative integer αj (j = 1, . . . , d), we write
Dαj
j

with α = (0, . . . , 0,

General Concept of Quantum Field
8.3.1
Time-translation covariant quantum ﬁeld theory
We consider a quantum system in the d-dimensional space Rd with d ∈
N. In the usual physical sense, the space dimension d is taken to be 3.
But we do not restrict ourselves to this case for the following reasons: (1)
mathematical generality; (2) we want to clarify the dependence of theories
on the space dimension d and to know what are essential diﬀerences of
theories with d = 3 from those with d ̸= 3. This may bring us insights
about the “meaning” of d = 3.
The space-time is given by
R1+d := R × Rd = {(x0, x)|x0 ∈R, x ∈Rd}
= {(x0, x1, . . . , xd)|xµ ∈R, µ = 0, . . . , d},
where xµ (µ = 0, 1, . . ., d) denotes the µth coordinate of the point x ∈R1+d,
in particular, x0 and x = (x1, . . . , xd) are the time coordinate and the space
component of x respectively.2
The vector space R1+d has many metrics.3
But, for the time being,
we proceed without specifying a metric of R1+d, treating R1+d only as a
2We take the upper index notation xµ (µ = 0, 1, . . . , d), which is convenient in rela-
tivistic QFT discussed later.
3Let V be a real vector space. A metric of V is a bilinear form g : V ×V →R satisfying
the following (i) and (ii): (i) (non-degeneracy) if a vector u ∈V satisﬁes g(u, v) = 0 for
all v ∈V , then u = 0; (ii) (symmetry) g(u, v) = g(v, u) for all u, v ∈V . In one word, g
is a non-degenerate symmetric covariant tensor of degree 2 on V . A metric g of V is said
to be positive (resp. negative) deﬁnite if g(u, u) ≥0 (resp. g(u, u) ≤0) for all u. In
the both cases, one can show that g(u, u) = 0 if and only if u = 0. Hence a metric g of
V is an inner product of V if and only if g is positive deﬁnite. On the other hand, g is
said to be indeﬁnite if there exist points u, v ∈V such that g(u, u) > 0 and g(v, v) < 0.

topological space with the standard topology.4 This approach will clarify
aspects of QFT independent of metrics of R1+d.
In general, in the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics which
is due to von Neumann, a state of a quantum system is described by a
non-zero vector in a Hilbert space H and a physical quantity is given by
a self-adjoint operator on H . Among others, the self-adjoint operator H
which describes the total energy of a quantum system is called the Hamil-
tonian of the system. According to an axiom of quantum mechanics, the
strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group {e−itH/ℏ}t∈R governs the
time development of the quantum system in the way that, for any state vec-
tor Ψ ∈H at time 0, the state vector at time t ∈R is given by e−itH/ℏΨ,
provided that no measurement is made on the quantum system in the time
interval [0, t].
As suggested by heuristic arguments made in textbooks of QFT in
physics, a quantum ﬁeld may be an object which has the function that
creates or annihilates elementary particles in the space-time. A priori a
quantum ﬁeld itself may not be necessarily a physical quantity, but it should
be a linear operator acting in a Hilbert space of quantum states and re-
lated to other physical quantities in a harmonious way with laws. Thus it
is suggested that a general concept of a quantum ﬁeld may not be deﬁned
without reference to other physical quantities. We ﬁrst deﬁne a class of
QFT with a Hamiltonian.
For a function f on R1+d and a = (a0, a) ∈R1+d, we deﬁne the function
fa on R1+d by
fa(x) := f(x −a) = f(x0 −a0, x −a),
x = (x0, x) ∈R1+d.
(8.4)
The function fa is called the space-time translation (or simply trans-
lation) of f by the vector a. In particular, for each time t ∈R, f(t,0) is
called the time-translation of f by t, and f(0,a) with a ∈Rd is called the
space-translation of f by a.
It is easy to see that, for all f ∈S (R1+d), fa ∈S (R1+d) (Problem 2).
Deﬁnition 8.2. A time-translation covariant QFT on the space-time
R1+d is a quartet (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) (s ∈N) consisting of a Hilbert space
F, a dense subspace D ⊂F, a self-adjoint operator H on F and an s-tuple
(ϕr)s
r=1 with ϕr ∈S ′(R1+d, L(F)) (r = 1, . . . , s) such that the following
(QF.1) and (QF.2) hold:
4It is important to distinguish the concept of metric from that of topology.
In the
physics literature, confusions are sometimes seen on this aspect.
 

432
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(QF.1) For all f ∈S (R1+d), ϕr(f) and ϕr(f)∗leave D invariant:
ϕr(f)D ⊂D,
ϕr(f)∗D ⊂D.
(QF.2) (time-translation covariance) For all t ∈R and f ∈S (R1+d),
ϕr(f(t,0)) = eitH/ℏϕr(f)e−itH/ℏ
on D (r = 1, . . . , s).
(8.5)
The s-tuple (ϕr)s
r=1 of operator-valued distributions is called an s-
component quantum ﬁeld and H is called the Hamiltonian.
Also
each component ϕr is called a quantum ﬁeld.
Remark 8.3. (1) Deﬁnition 8.2 is a general deﬁnition of a QFT noting
only the basic relation (8.5) between quantum ﬁelds and the Hamiltonian.
It is independent of whether or not the theory considered is relativistic in
the sense of Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
As is well known, a classical scalar ﬁeld is a function on the space-
time. Hence it would be natural to ask why a quantum ﬁeld is deﬁned
as an operator-valued distribution, not as an operator-valued function on
the space-time. One of the reasons comes from taking into account the
canonical quantization scheme which is a heuristic scheme to formulate a
QFT from a classical ﬁeld theory. In this scheme, for a classical scalar ﬁeld
ϕcl(x) and its canonical conjugate πcl(x) (x ∈R1+d), a quantum ﬁeld ϕ(x)
and its canonical conjugate π(x) are supposed to exist as algebraic elements
satisfying the equal-time canonical commutation relations
[ϕ(t, x), π(t, y)] = iℏδ(x −y),
[ϕ(t, x), ϕ(t, y)] = 0,
[π(t, x), π(t, y)] = 0,
(t, x), (t, y) ∈R1+d,
where δ(x −y) is the diagonal delta distribution on R2d (see Subsection
D.3.3 in Appendix D).
But, since δ(x −y) is not a function, it is not
expected that the mapping:(t, x) 7→ϕ(t, x) (resp. π(t, x)) is an operator-
valued function.5 Hence it may be legitimate to deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld as
the smeared one: “ϕ(t, g) = R
Rd ϕ(t, x)g(x)dx” (g ∈S (Rd)) or “ϕ(f) =
R
R1+d ϕ(x)f(x)dx” (f ∈S (R1+d)). Then the above equal-time canonical
commutation relations are replaced as follows:
[ϕ(t, g), π(t, h)] = iℏ
Z
Rd g(x)h(x)dx,
[ϕ(t, g), ϕ(t, h)] = 0,
[π(t, g), π(t, h)] = 0, t ∈R, g, h ∈S (Rd).
5Suppose that ϕ(·) and π(·) are operator-valued functions on R1+d. Then, by analogy
with classical ﬁelds, it would be natural to assume that there exists a subspace D such
that D ⊂∩x,y∈R1+dD(ϕ(x)π(y)) ∩D(π(y)ϕ(x)) and, for all Ψ, Φ ∈D, the function:
R1+d × R1+d ∋(x, y) 7→⟨Ψ, ϕ(x)π(y)Φ⟩(resp. ⟨Ψ, π(y)ϕ(x)Φ⟩) is continuous. But, in
that case, the equation ⟨Ψ, [ϕ(t, x), π(t, y)]Φ⟩= iℏδ(x −y) ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩is contradictory, since
the left hand side is continuous in (t, x, y).
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
433
As we shall see later (Subsection 8.3.3 below), there are cases where the
object ϕ(t, g) is mathematically meaningful.
There is another reason to deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld as an operator-valued
distribution. From a quantum mechanical point of view, the physical notion
of one point in the space-time may be meaningless.6 It may be natural to
suppose that the strength of a quantum ﬁeld is measured in a ﬁnite region
in the space-time which may be variable, not at one point in the space-
time.
The operator-value ϕ(f) of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ as an operator-
valued distribution corresponds to such a measurement in a space-time
region which includes the support of f.
In addition, there is an surprising theorem that, in a framework of
relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, a non-trivial (non-constant) quantum ﬁeld
cannot be an operator-valued function on the space-time (Wightman’s
theorem7).
(2) A physical picture contained in Deﬁnition 8.2 is as follows. Since
f(t,0) physically means the time translation of f by t as mentioned above,
ϕr(f(t,0)) is interpreted as the time translation of the quantum ﬁeld ϕr by
t. Property (QF.2) shows that the time-translated quantum ﬁeld ϕr(f(t,0))
is unitarily implementable on D with the unitary operator e−itH/ℏwhich
governs the time-development of states of the quantum system under con-
sideration. This property is called the unitary covariance of the quantum
ﬁeld (ϕr)s
r=1 with respect to time or simply the time-translation covari-
ance of (ϕr)s
r=1.
The operator eitH/ℏϕr(f)e−itH/ℏis the Heisenberg operator of ϕr(f)
with respect to the Hamiltonian H (see Section 5.16), which describes the
quantum ﬁeld at time t. Hence (8.5) means that the time-translated quan-
tum ﬁeld ϕr(f(t,0)) coincides with the Heisenberg operator of ϕr(f) on D.
This is a harmonious relation. Equation (8.5) is symbolically written in
terms of distribution kernels as follows:
ϕr(x0 + t, x) = eitH/ℏϕr(x0, x)e−itH/ℏ
on D.
(3) Let U(t) := e−itH/ℏ, t ∈R. Then the mapping U : t 7→U(t) is a
strongly continuous unitary representation of R (as a translation group) on
F (see Subsection 2.9.2), satisfying
ϕr(f(t,0)) = U(t)∗ϕr(f)U(t)
on D
(8.6)
6Recall that the probability of ﬁnding a quantum particle at one point in the space is
theoretically zero.
7See, e.g., [Bogoliubov et al. (1975), §2.4].
 

434
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
for all t ∈R, f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s.
Conversely one can reformulate a time-translation covariant QFT as a
quartet (F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1) with H replaced by a strongly continuous uni-
tary representation U : R →GL(F); R ∋t 7→U(t) ∈GL(F) satisfying
(8.6). Then, by Stone’s theorem, there exists a unique self-adjoint opera-
tor H on F such that U(t) = e−itH/ℏ, t ∈R. Hence a time-translation
covariant QFT (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) is obtained.
By these considerations, we see that the theory (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) is
equivalent to the theory (F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1).
(4) Deﬁnition 8.2 gives a general concept of a QFT which has a uni-
tary covariance with respect to time. By adding covariances with resepct
to other transformations such as translations, rotations in space Rd and
Poincar´e transformations in R1+d (see Subsection 8.8.5 below), one obtains
more specialized forms of the theory. In particular, a relativistic QFT is a
special form of time-translation covariant QFT. We shall see these aspects
below.
(5) The natural number s in Deﬁnition 8.2, which accounts the number
of the components of a multi-component quantum ﬁeld, depends on the
kind of quantum ﬁeld (scalar ﬁeld, vector ﬁeld, tensor ﬁeld, spinor ﬁeld
etc.). For more details on this point, see, e.g., [Streater and Wightman
(1964), p.99] and [Bogoliubov et al. (1975), Chapter 3].
(6) As is easily seen, if a self-adjoint operator H satisﬁes (8.5), then, for
all E ∈R, (8.5) with H replaced by H + E holds. But we regard H + E as
an operator essentially same as H.
For (ϕr)s
r=1, a self-adjoint operator H satisfying (8.5) is not necessarily
unique up to addition of scalar operators. In Proposition 8.1 below, we
shall give a suﬃcient condition for H to be unique up to addition of scalar
operators.
8.3.2
Uniqueness of Hamiltonians
Proposition 8.1. Let (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a time-translation covariant
QFT on R1+d such that, for all t ∈R, eitHD ⊂D and
{ϕr(f)↾D|f ∈S (R1+d), r = 1, . . . , s}′ = CI,
where {· · · }′ denotes the commutant of {· · · } (see (5.40)). Suppose that
there exists a self-adjoint operator H′ satisfying (8.5) with H replaced by
H′ such that eitH′D ⊂D for all t ∈R. Then there exists a constant E ∈R
such that H′ = H + E.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
435
Proof. By the assumption, we have
eitHϕr(f)e−itHΨ = eitH′ϕr(f)e−itH′Ψ
for all Ψ ∈D, t ∈R, f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s (we have replaced
t/ℏby t). Hence ϕr(f)e−itHΨ = e−itHeitH′ϕr(f)e−itH′Ψ. For each Φ ∈
D, Ψ := eitH′Φ is in D. Hence, putting T (t) := e−itHeitH′, we obtain
ϕr(f)T (t)Φ = T (t)ϕr(f)Φ. Hence
T (t) ∈{ϕr(f)↾D|f ∈S (R1+d), r = 1, . . . , s}′.
Therefore T (t) = c(t)I with a constant c(t) depending on t.
Hence
eitH′ = c(t)eitH. The unitarity of T (t) implies that |c(t)| = 1. The group
property of {eitH′}t∈R and {eitH}t∈R yields c(t + t′) = c(t)c(t′), t, t′ ∈R.
In particular, c(0) = 1. Since T (t) is strongly continuous in t, it follows
that c(t) is continuous in t. Hence c(t) = eiEt for some constant E ∈R.
This means that eitH′ = eit(H+E), ∀t ∈R. Hence H′ = H + E
8.3.3
Sharp-time quantum ﬁelds
There are classes of quantum ﬁelds in which each quantum ﬁeld is well-
deﬁned even if it is not smeared in the time variable t. We next introduce
such a class of quantum ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 8.3. A sharp-time QFT on R1+d is a quartet (F, D, H,
{ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s) (s ∈N) consisting of a Hilbert space F, a dense sub-
space D ⊂F, a self-adjoint operator H on F and a set {ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s
of operator-valued distributions on Rd with values in L(F) (ϕr(t, f) ∈
L(F), t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd)) satisfying the following (i) and (ii):
(i) For all t ∈R, r = 1, . . . , s and f ∈S (Rd), D ⊂D(ϕr(t, f)) ∩
D(ϕr(t, f)∗) and ϕr(t, f)D ⊂D, ϕr(t, f)∗D ⊂D.
(ii) For all t ∈R and f ∈S (Rd),
ϕr(t, f) = eitH/ℏϕr(0, f)e−itH/ℏ
on D.
(8.7)
The operator-valued distribution ϕr(t, ·) is called a quantum ﬁeld at time
t and H is called the Hamiltonian.
A uniqueness theorem on Hamiltonians holds for a sharp-time QFT too:
Proposition 8.2. Let (F, D, H, {ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s) be a sharp-time QFT
on R1+d such that, for all t ∈R, eitHD ⊂D and
{ϕr(0, f)↾D|f ∈S (Rd), r = 1, . . . , s}′ = CI.

Suppose that there exists a self-adjoint operator H′ satisfying (8.7) with H
replaced by H′ such that eitH′D ⊂D for all t ∈R. Then there exists a
constant E ∈R such that H′ = H + E.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Proposition 8.1.
One can deduce a sharp-time QFT from a time-translation covari-
ant QFT with an additional property in the following manner.
Let
(F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a time-translation covariant QFT with the additional
condition that
e−itH/ℏD ⊂D,
t ∈R.
(8.8)
Suppose that, for each t ∈R and r = 1, . . . , s, there exists an operator-
valued distribution ϕr(t, ·) satisfying the following (a)–(c):
(a) For all t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd) and r = 1, . . . , s, D ⊂D(ϕr(t, f)) ∩
D(ϕr(t, f)∗).
(b) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D and f ∈S (Rd), the function:R ∋t 7→⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩
is continuous on R and
Z
R
|u(t)| | ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩|dt < ∞,
u ∈S (R).
(8.9)
(c) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D, u ∈S (R) and f ∈S (Rd),
⟨Φ, ϕr(u × f)Ψ⟩=
Z
R
u(t) ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩dt.
If such operator-valued distributions {ϕr(t, ·)}t,r exist, then each ϕ(t, f) ↾
D is unique. This is proved as follows.
Suppose that there exists another operator-valued distribution ηr(t, f)
satisfying the above (a)–(c) with ϕr(t, f) replaced by ηr(t, f).
Then, it
follows from (c) that, for all u ∈S (R),
Z
R
u(t) ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩dt =
Z

u(t) ⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩dt.
By (b), the functions ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩, and ⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩of t are locally
integrable.
Hence, by du Bois-Reymond’s lemma, ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩
=
⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩a.e. t. Since the both functions are continuous in t, it fol-
lows that, for all t ∈R, ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩. This holds for
all Φ ∈D and D is dense. Hence ϕr(t, f)Ψ = ηr(t, f)Ψ, implying that
ϕr(t, f) ↾D = ηr(t, f) ↾D.
Let us show that (8.7) holds. For each t ∈R and a function u on R, we
deﬁne a function ut by
ut(x0) := u(x0 −t),
x0 ∈R.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
437
The function ut is the time translation of u by t.
It is easy to see that, if u ∈S (R), then ut ∈S (R).
Let Ψ, Φ ∈D, f ∈S (Rd), u ∈S (R) and t ∈R. Then, by (c), we have
⟨Φ, ϕr(ut × f)Ψ⟩=

On the other hand, by (8.5),

=

where we have used condition (8.8). Hence, by du Boi-Raymond’s lemma,

Φ, ϕr(x0 + t, f)Ψ

e−itH/ℏΦ, ϕr(x0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ
E

.
Hence
ϕr(x0 + t, f)Ψ = eitH/ℏϕr(x0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ.
Putting x0 = 0, we obtain ϕr(t, f)Ψ = eitH/ℏϕr(0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ. Thus (8.7)
holds.
Conversely, there exists a structure which makes it possible to construct
a time-translation covariant QFT from a sharp-time QFT. We outline it
brieﬂy.
Let (F, D, H, {ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s) be a sharp-time QFT such that, for
all Ψ, Φ ∈D and f ∈S (Rd), the function:R ∋t 7→⟨Ψ, ϕr(t, f)Φ⟩is
continuous and (8.9) holds.
[Step 1] For each pair (Ψ, Φ) ∈D × D, one deﬁnes a bilinear form LΨ,Φ
on S (R) × S (Rd) by
LΨ,Φ(u, f) :=
Z
R
u(t) ⟨Ψ, ϕr(t, f)Φ⟩dt,
u ∈S (R), f ∈S (Rd).
[Step 2] Under additional conditions (if necessary), one shows that
LΨ,Φ is separately continuous (see Appendix D).
Then, by Schwartz’s
nuclear theorem (Theorem D.5 in Appendix D), there exists a unique
eLΨ,Φ ∈S ′(R1+d) such that
eLΨ,Φ(u × f) =
Z
R
u(t) ⟨Ψ, ϕr(t, f)Φ⟩dt,
u ∈S (R), f ∈S (Rd).
 

438

[Step 3] Under additional conditions (if necessary), one shows that,
for all Φ ∈D and F ∈S (R1+d), the conjugate linear mapping: Ψ 7→
eLΨ,Φ(F) ∈C is a continuous linear functional.8 Then, by the density of D
and Riesz’s representation theorem, there exists a unique vector ΦF ∈F
such that, for all Ψ ∈D, eLΨ,Φ(F) = ⟨Ψ, ΦF⟩. So one deﬁnes a mapping
ϕr(F) : D →F by ϕr(F)Φ := ΦF , Φ ∈D. The mapping ϕr(F) is a linear
operator on F with D(ϕr(F)) = D and linear in F.
[Step 4] One shows that (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) is a time-translation covari-
ant QFT.

operator-valued distribution on R1+d. We remark, however, that the above
procedures are not always possible.
It may depend on each individual
sharp-time QFT.
Examples of time-translation covariant QFT and sharp-time QFT will
be discussed in later chapters.

Equations for Quantum Fields
Let us derive diﬀerential equations for a quantum ﬁeld in a time-translation
covariant QFT. As in Appendix D, if a sequence {fn}n in S (R1+d) con-
verges to f ∈S (R1+d) in the topology of S (R1+d), we write fn
S

(n →∞).
Lemma 8.1. For all f ∈S (R1+d),
f(t,0) −f

Proof. Let t ∈R, t ̸= 0 and
gt(x) := f(t,0)(x) −f(x)
t

x ∈R1+d.
Then, by elementary calculus, we have

Cr(u, f, Φ)∥Ψ∥.

For any multi-index α = (α0, α1, . . . , αd), we have
∂αgt(x) = (∂αf)(t,0)(x) −(∂αf)(x)

x ∈R1+d.
Hence

hand side, we obtain
|∂αgt(x)| ≤|t| sup
|τ|≤|t|
|∂βf(x0 + τ, x)|.
Let
xτ := (x0 + τ, x).
Then, for all x ∈R1+d,
|x| = |x −xτ + xτ| ≤|x −xτ| + |xτ| = |τ| + |xτ|.
Let |τ| ≤|t| ≤1. Then |x| ≤1 + |xτ|. Hence, for all m ∈Z+,
(1 + |x|)m ≤(2 + |xτ|)m ≤2m(1 + |xτ|)m.
Hence
(1 + |x|)m|∂αgt(x)| ≤2m|t| ∥f∥m,β.
Therefore
∥gt∥m,α ≤2m|t| ∥f∥m,β →0
(t →0).
Thus (8.10) holds.
For an operator-valued distribution ϕ on R1+d with values in L(F),
we denote by Dµϕ ∈S ′(R1+d, L(F)) the partial derivative of ϕ in the
variable xµ (µ = 0, 1, . . ., d):
Dµϕ(f) := −ϕ(∂µf),
ϕ ∈S ′(R1+d, L(F)), f ∈S (R1+d).
Theorem 8.1. Let (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a time-translation covariant
QFT and suppose that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) D ⊂D(H).
(ii) For all f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s, HD ⊂D(ϕr(f)).
(iii) For all Ψ ∈D, f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s, the F-valued function
:R ∋t →ϕr(f)e−itH/ℏΨ is strongly continuous.

(8.11)
Proof. We ﬁrst prove (8.11) with n = 1. Let Ψ, Φ ∈D and f ∈S (R1+d).
Then
⟨Φ, D0ϕr(f)Ψ⟩= −⟨Φ, ϕr(∂0f)Ψ⟩.
By applying Lemma 8.1 to ∂0f on the right hand side, we have
⟨Φ, D0ϕr(f)Ψ⟩= lim
t→0

Φ, ϕr(f(t,0))Ψ

−⟨Φ, ϕr(f)Ψ⟩

Using the time-translation covariance (8.5), we have
⟨Φ, D0ϕr(f)Ψ⟩= lim
t→0

Φ, eitH/ℏϕr(f)e−itH/ℏΨ

−⟨Φ, ϕr(f)Ψ⟩

To compute the right hand side, we note the following facts:

Φ, eitH/ℏϕr(f)e−itH/ℏΨ

−⟨Φ, ϕr(f)Ψ⟩
t

e−itH/ℏ−1

and, for all Ξ ∈D(H),
lim

Ξ = −i
ℏHΞ.
Condition (iii) implies that
lim
t→0 ϕr(f)e−itH/ℏΨ = ϕr(f)Ψ.
Using these facts, we obtain
⟨Φ, D0ϕr(f)Ψ⟩=

Φ, i
ℏ[H, ϕr(f)]Ψ

.
Since D is dense, (8.11) with n = 1 follows.
To prove (8.11) with n arbitrary, we use the method by induction in n.
Suppose that (8.11) holds with n = k. Then
Dk+1

ϕr(f)Ψ = −Dk
0ϕr(D0f)Ψ = −i

Hence (8.11) with n = k + 1 holds.

in the sense of operator-valued distribution. Note that (8.12) has the form
of the Heisenberg equation of motion for ϕr(x) with respect to H.9
We remark that, in most of concrete models in QFT, (8.12) and (8.13)
are realized as dynamical equations of the quantum ﬁeld (ϕr)s
r=1.
8.5
Vacuum Expectation Values and Wightman
Distributions
Let us consider a time-translation covariant QFT (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) on
R1+d such that H is bounded from below. Then
E0(H) := inf σ(H),
(8.14)
the inﬁmum of the spectrum of H, is ﬁnite and called the lowest energy
of H.
If E0(H) is an eigenvalue of H, then a non-zero vector Ψ in the
eigenspace ker(H −E0(H)) ̸= {0} is called a ground state or a vacuum
of H.
9In general, an operator-valued function A : R ∋t 7→A(t) ∈L(H ) (H is a Hilbert
space) is said to obey the strong Heisenberg equation of motion on a subspace
D ⊂H with respect to a self-adjoint operator S on H if D ⊂D([S, A(t)]), t ∈R and,
for all ψ ∈D, A(t)ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t with
dA(t)ψ
dt
= i
ℏ[S, A(t)]ψ.
This is heuristically written as dA(t)/dt = (i/ℏ)[S, A(t)]. There is a weaker version of
Heisenberg equation of motion [Arai (2007)].
 

442
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The ground state (or vacuum) of H is said to be unique if dim ker(H −
E0(H)) = 1 (i.e., the multiplicity of E0(H) as an eigenvalue of H is one).
If dim ker(H −E0(H)) ≥2, then the ground state (or vacuum) of H is said
to be degenerate.
In the literature, one sometimes notices the case where E0(H) is called
the ground state energy even if H has no ground states. But this would not
be suitable in the case where H has no ground states. We want to emphasize
that, as is seen above, E0(H) is deﬁned independently of whether or not H
has a ground state.
By the way, it should be pointed out that it is non-trivial at all to prove
existence of a ground state in concrete models in QFT. Indeed, to prove
existence or absence of a ground state in QFT is one of the most important
and central issues in mathematical theory of QFT. We shall come back to
this aspect later.
We now consider the case where H has a ground state and suppose that
ker(H −E0(H)) ⊂D.
Let Ψ0 ∈ker(H −E0(H)) be a unit vector (∥Ψ0∥= 1). Then, for n ∈
N and (r1, . . . , rn) ∈{1, . . . , s}n, one can deﬁne a functional E(n)
r1,...,rn on
S (R1+d)n by
E(n)
r1,...,rn(f1, . . . , fn) := ⟨Ψ0, ϕr1(f1) · · · ϕrn(fn)Ψ0⟩
for all (f1, . . . , fn) ∈S (R1+d)n. These functionals are called the n-point
vacuum expectation values (VEV) of (ϕr)s
r=1 with respect to the vac-
uum Ψ0.
It is easy to see that E(n)
r1,...,rn is an n-linear form on S (R1+d). Since the
correspondence S (R1+d) ∋f 7→⟨Ψ, ϕr(f)Φ⟩(Ψ, Φ ∈D) is continuous in
the topology of S (R1+d), it follows that E(n)
r1,...,rn is separately continuous.
Hence, by Schwartz’s nuclear theorem (Theorem D.5 in Appendix D), there
exists a unique element W (n)
r1,...,rn in S ′((R1+d)n) such that
W (n)
r1,...,rn(f1×· · ·×fn) = Er1,...,rn(f1, . . . , fn),
fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n.
Therefore
W (n)
r1,...,rn(f1 × · · · × fn) = ⟨Ψ0, ϕr1(f1) · · · ϕrn(fn)Ψ0⟩.
The tempered distributions W (n)
r1,...,rn are called the n-point Wightman
distributions with respect to the vacuum Ψ0.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
443
In concrete models in QFT, it is heuristically shown that many physical
properties contained in QFT may be derived from the set of Wightman
distributions, although we do not discuss this aspect here.10
Remark 8.4. In a sharp-time QFT (F, D, H, (ϕr(t, ·))t∈R,r=1,...,s), the
VEV’s are deﬁned as follows:
⟨Ψ0, ϕr1(t1, f1) · · · ϕrn(tn, fn)Ψ0⟩
for n ∈N, rj ∈{1, . . . , s}, tj ∈R and fj ∈S (Rd) (j = 1, . . . , n).
8.6
Unitary Representations of Topological Groups
Before discussing a general theory of QFT further, we here make a mathe-
matical interlude.
As is well known, a classical mechanical system may have various sym-
metries which are described by transformation groups on the space-time.
On the other hand, a symmetry in a quantum system is given in a form of
unitary representation of a group (see Subsection 2.9.2).
A basic fact on strongly continuous unitary representations of Rn as a
translation group is given in the following theorem:
Theorem 8.2. Let n ∈N and H be a Hilbert space. Let U : Rn →U(H )
(the unitary group on H ) be a strongly continuous unitary representation
of Rn, i.e., for each a ∈Rn, U(a) ∈U(H ) and the mapping:a 7→U(a) is
strongly continuous and satisﬁes
U(a + b) = U(a)U(b),
a, b ∈Rn.
(8.15)
Then there exists a unique n-tuple (A1, . . . , An) of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H such that
U(a) = eia1A1 · · · eianAn,
a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈Rn,
where the order of the exponential operators eiajAj (j = 1, . . . , n) in the
operator product on the right hand side can be arbitrary.
Proof. Let {ej}n
j=1 be the standard basis of Rn so that, for all a =
(a1, . . . , an) ∈Rn, a = Pn
j=1 ajej.
For each j = 1, . . . , n, we deﬁne
Uj(t) := U(tej), t ∈R. Then it is easy to see that {Uj(t)}t∈R is a strongly
10For example, the so-called scattering-matrix (S-matrix), which describes probability
amplitudes for scattering phenomena of elementary particles, are represented in terms
of Wightman distributions.
 

444
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
continuous one-parameter unitary group. Hence, by Stone’s theorem (The-
orem 1.22), there exists a unique self-adjoint operator Aj on H such that
Uj(t) = eitAj, t ∈R. Since U(a + b) = U(b + a), we have
U(a)U(b) = U(b)(a),
a, b ∈Rn,
i.e., the set {U(a)}a∈Rn is commutative. Hence
Uj(aj)Uk(ak) = Uk(ak)Uj(aj),
j, k = 1, . . . , n,
implying that eiajAjeiakAk = eiakAkeiajAj. Hence Aj and Ak are strongly
commuting. Thus (A1, . . . , An) is an n-tuple of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H .
By (8.15), we have for all permutations σ ∈Sn
U(a) = U(aσ(1)eσ(1) + · · · + aσ(n)Aσ(n))
= U(aσ(1)Aσ(1)) · · · U(aσ(n)Aσ(n))
= eiaσ(1)Aσ(1) · · · eiaσ(n)Aσ(n).
This completes the proof.
The n-tuple (A1, . . . , An) in Theorem 8.2 is called the generator of the
strongly continuous unitary representation {U(a)|a ∈Rn}.
Let X be a topological space and H be a Hilbert space. A mapping
f : X →H is said to be weakly continuous if, for all ψ ∈H , the
function:X ∋x 7→⟨ψ, f(x)⟩is continuous.
A mapping T : X →B(H ) is said to be weakly continuous if, for all
ψ ∈H , the function:X ∋x 7→T (x)ψ is weakly continuous.
The following fact is useful in applications:
Lemma 8.2. Let U : X →U(H ); X ∋x 7→U(x) ∈U(H ) be weakly
continuous. Then U is strongly continuous.
Proof. Let ψ ∈H and a ∈X be ﬁxed arbitrarily. Put φ := U(a)ψ. Then,
by the weak continuity of U, for any ε > 0, there exists a neighborhood
Va of a such that, for all x ∈Va, | ⟨φ, U(x)ψ⟩−⟨φ, U(a)ψ⟩| < ε. Since
⟨φ, U(a)ψ⟩= ∥ψ∥2, we have
| ∥ψ∥2 −⟨U(a)ψ, U(x)ψ⟩| < ε,
x ∈Va.
Hence
∥U(x)ψ −U(a)ψ∥2 = 2(∥ψ∥2 −Re ⟨U(a)ψ, U(x)ψ⟩) < 2ε,
x ∈Va.
Hence U(·)ψ is strongly continuous at x = a.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
445
Lemma 8.2 can be brought into a more convenient form:
Lemma 8.3. Let X be a topological space, U : X →U(H ) and D be
a dense subspace in H .
Suppose that, for all ψ, φ ∈D, the function:
X ∋x 7→⟨φ, U(x)ψ⟩is continuous. Then U is strongly continuous.
Proof. By Lemma 8.2, we need only to show the weak continuity of U.
For any ψ, φ ∈H , we set F(x) := ⟨ψ, U(x)φ⟩. By the density of D, there
exist sequences {ψn}n and {φn}n such that ψn →ψ, φn →φ (n →∞).
Let Fn(x) := ⟨ψn, U(x)φn⟩. Then
|Fn(x) −F(x)| = | ⟨ψn −ψ, U(x)φn⟩+ ⟨ψ, U(x)(φn −φ)⟩|
≤∥ψn −ψ∥C + ∥ψ∥∥φn −φ∥,
where C := supn≥1 ∥φn∥< ∞. For any ε > 0, there exist an n0 ∈N such
that, for all n ≥n0, ∥ψn −ψ∥C + ∥ψ∥∥φn −φ∥< ε Hence
sup
x∈X
|Fn(x) −F(x)| ≤ε,
n ≥n0.
Now we ﬁx a ∈X arbitrarily. For any x ∈X, by the triangle inequality,
|F(x) −F(a)| ≤|F(x) −Fn0(x)| + |Fn0(x) −Fn0(a)| + |Fn0(a) −F(a)|
≤2ε + |Fn0(x) −F(a)|.
Since the function Fn0 is continuous on X, for any ε > 0, there exists a
neighborhood Va of a such that
Va ⊂{x ∈X| |Fn0(x) −Fn0(a)| < ε}.
Hence, for all x ∈Va, |F(x) −F(a)| < 3ε. This means that F is continuous
at x = a.
Example 8.6. For each a ∈R1+d, a mapping u(a) : L2(R1+d) →L2(R1+d)
is deﬁned as follows:
u(a)f = fa,
f ∈L2(R1+d),
where fa is the translation of f by a (see (8.4)). It is easy to see that u(a)
is unitary and
u(a + b) = u(a)u(b) = u(b)u(a),
a, b ∈R1+d.
By applying Lemma 8.3 with (X, H , D) = (R1+d, L2(R1+d), C∞
0 (R1+d)),
one can show that u(a) is strongly continuous in a. Hence, by Theorem 8.2,
there exists a unique (1 + d)-tuple (π0, π1, . . . , πd) of strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators on L2(R1+d) such that
u(a) = eia0π0eia1π1 · · · eiadπd.

By considering the strong derivative of u(0, . . . , 0, aµ, 0, . . . , 0)f (f

0 (R1+d)) at aµ = 0, one can show that
πµ = iDµ
(µ = 0, 1, . . ., d)
with Dµ being the generalized partial diﬀerential operator in the variable
xµ acting in L2(R1+d). As is seen, this example with 1 + d replaced by d
gives a proof of Theorem 1.32.
8.7
Translation Covariant QFT
Let F be a Hilbert space as before, D be a dense subspace in F and
(ϕr)s
r=1 be an s-tuple of operator-valued distributions on R1+d with values
in L(F) such that, for all f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s, D ⊂D(ϕr(f)) ∩
D(ϕr(f)∗) and ϕr(f)D ⊂D, ϕr(f)∗D ⊂D.
Suppose that there exists
a strongly continuous unitary representation U : R1+d →U(F) of the
(1+d)-dimensional translation group R1+d such that, for all f ∈S (R1+d),
r = 1, . . . , s and a ∈R1+d,
ϕr(fa) = U(a)ϕr(f)U(a)−1
on D.
Then (F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1) is called a translation covariant QFT on R1+d.
By Lemma 8.2, there exists a unique (1 + d)-tuple
P := (P0, P1, . . . , Pd)
of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on F such that
U(a) = eia0P0/ℏeia1P1/ℏ· · · eiadPd/ℏ,
a ∈R1+d.
The operator vector P is called the energy-momentum operator of the
quantum ﬁeld (ϕr)s
r=1. The 0th component P0 and the d-tuple of the other
components
P := (P 1, . . . , P d)
with P j := −Pj (j = 1, . . . , d) are respectively called the Hamiltonian
and the momentum operator of the translation covariant QFT under
consideration.11
By an application of Proposition 1.36, we have
eitP0/ℏPµe−itP0/ℏ= Pµ,
µ = 0, 1, . . . , d, t ∈R.
11Sometimes (P1, . . . , Pd) also is called the momentum operator.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
447
Namely each Pµ is a conserved quantity.12 Hence, in particular, the energy-
momentum operator is a conserved quantity.
Since the energy-momentum operator P is strongly commuting, it
has the joint spectrum σJ(P) (see Subsection 1.8.2).
This set is called
the energy-momentum spectrum of the translation covariant QFT
(F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1). This is an important quantity which characterizes the
QFT.
Since P is strongly commuting, ((P 1)2, . . . , (P d)2) also is strongly com-
muting (apply Theorem 1.28). Hence it follows from Corollary 1.6(ii) that
P 2 :=
d

 P 21/2 .
We call |P | the modulus of the momentum operator P .
The dual space
(R1+d)∗:= {k = (k0, k1, . . . , kd)|kµ ∈R, µ = 0, 1, . . ., d}
of the space-time R1+d is called the wave number vector space.13
By the de Broglie-Einstein-Planck relation, the momentum p of a quan-
tum particle is related to the wave number vector k by
p = ℏk.
Hence p ∈ℏ(R1+d)∗:= {ℏk|k ∈(R1+d)∗}. Based on this relation, we write
R1+d
p
:= ℏ(R1+d)∗.
A natural bilinear form on R1+d × R1+d
p
: (x, p) 7→R is given by
xp :=
X
µ=0
xµpµ,
x ∈R1+d, p ∈R1+d
p
.
For each p = (p0, p1, . . . , pd) ∈R1+d
p
, the component p0 denotes the
energy coordinate and (p1, . . . , pd) the momentum coordinate. We
set
p := (p1, . . . , pd),
pj := −pj.
12In a quantum system whose Hamiltonian is given by a self-adjoint operator H on
a Hilbert space, independent of time t, a linear operator A (a quantum mechanical
quantity) on H is said to be a conserved quantity if its Heisenberg operator with
respect to H is independent of t: eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ= A, ∀t ∈R. An n-tuple (A1, . . . , An)
of linear operators is said to be a conserved quantity if each Aj is a conserved quantity.
13Sometimes the symbol R1+d
x
(resp. R1+d
k
) is used instead of R1+d (resp. (R1+d)∗).

The above energy-momentum spectrum σJ(P) is physically interpreted
as a subset of R1+d
p
.
An operator inequality for the components of P gives a condition on
σJ(P):
Proposition 8.3. Let γ > 0 be a constant. Then
P0 ≥γ|P |.
(8.16)
if and only if
σJ(P) ⊂{p ∈R1+d
p
| p0 ≥γ|p|}.
(8.17)
Proof. We denote by EP
the joint spectral measure of P.
Hence
supp EP = σJ(P).
We ﬁrst show by contraposition that (8.16) implies (8.17). Hence sup-
pose that (8.17) does not hold. Then there exists a Borel set B ⊂σJ(P)
such that, for all p ∈B, p0 < γ|p| and EP (B) ̸= 0.
Let Kn := {p ∈
R1+d| |p| ≤n} (n ∈N). Then R1+d = ∪∞
n=1Kn. Hence B = ∪∞
n=1Bn with
Bn := Kn ∩B. If EP (Bn) = 0 for all n ∈N, then EP (B) = 0. But this is a
contradiction. Hence, for some n0, EP (Bn0) ̸= 0. We set B0 := Bn0. Then
B0 is bounded and EP (B0) ̸= 0. Hence, for all non-zero ψ ∈RanEP (B0),
ψ ∈D(P0) ∩D(|P |) and
⟨ψ, (P0 −γ|P |)ψ⟩=
Z
B0
(p0 −γ|p|)d∥EP (p)ψ∥2 < 0.
Hence (8.16) does not hold. Thus (8.16) implies (8.17).
We next show that (8.17) implies (8.16). Hence suppose that (8.17)
holds. Let ψ ∈D(P0). Then

Hence ψ ∈D(|P |). Therefore D(P0) ⊂D(|P |). Moreover,

|p|d∥EP (p)ψ∥2 = ⟨ψ, γ|P |ψ⟩.
Hence (8.16) holds.
A condition for σJ(P) such as (8.17) is called a spectral condition.
Proposition 8.3 gives a correspondence between a spectral condition and
an operator inequality for P0 and |P |.

Proposition 8.3 will have an application to relativistic QFT discussed
in the next section.
In what follows, we sometimes write (F, D, P, (ϕr)s
r=1) for the transla-
tion covariant QFT on R1+d.
In a translation covariant QFT, relations of eigenvalues of the Hamilto-
nian with those of the momentum operator also are important. To examine
this aspect, we note the following lemma:
Lemma 8.4. Let X be a Hilbert space and A, B be strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators on X . Suppose that σp(A) ̸= ∅. Let λ ∈σp(A) and
M := ker(A −λ) (the eigenspace of A with eigenvalue λ). Then:
(i) M reduces B.
(ii) If m := dim M < ∞, then there exists a CONS {ψj}m
j=1 of M such
that each ψj is an eigenvector of B.
Proof. (i) By Proposition 1.36(ii), AeisBψ = eisBAψ,
ψ ∈D(A).
In
particular, for all ψ ∈M , AeisBψ = λeisBψ. This means that eisBψ ∈M .
Hence, for all s ∈R, eisB leaves M invariant. It follows that eisBM =
M for all s.14
Hence, for all s ∈R, eisB can be regarded as a unitary
operator on M . Let PM be the orthogonal projection onto M . Then,
by the property of eisB just proved, PMeisBPM = eisBPM for all s ∈
R.
Taking the adjoint of both sides and replacing −s with s, we have
PM eisBPM = PM eisB.
Hence eisBPM = PMeisB.
Therefore, for all
φ ∈D(B), PM eisBφ = eisBPMφ. Considering the strong diﬀerentiation
of both sides at s = 0, we see that PM φ ∈D(B) and BPM φ = PM Bφ.
Hence PM B ⊂BPM . Thus M reduces B.
(ii) We denote by BM the reduced part of B to M . Since M is an m-
dimensional Hilbert space by the present assumption, the spectrum of BM
consists of only eigenvalues with ﬁnite multiplicity. By the self-adjointness
of BM, there exists a CONS {ψj}m
j=1 in which each ψj is an eigenvector of
BM.
A non-zero vector ψ in a Hilbert space X is called a simultaneous
eigenvector of some linear operators T1, . . . , Tn on X if it is an eigenvector
of each Tj (j = 1, . . . , n).
Each vector ψj in Lemma 8.4(ii) is a simultaneous eigenvector of A and
B: Aψj = λψj, Bψj = µjψj, where µj is an eigenvalue of BM.
14In general, if W is a unitary operator on a Hilbert space H and D is a subspace in
H such that W D ⊂D and W ∗D ⊂D, then W D = D (this is easy to prove).
 

450
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Thus Lemma 8.4 means that two strongly commuting self-adjoint oper-
ators have a simultaneous eigenvector if one of A and B has an eigenvalue
with ﬁnite multiplicity.
Theorem 8.3. Let (F, D, P, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a translation covariant QFT.
Suppose that P0 is bounded from below and has a unique ground state Ψ0.
Then Ψ0 is an eigenvector of each Pj (j = 1, . . . , d).
Proof. Let j = 1, . . . , d be ﬁxed. Applying Lemma 8.4 with A = P0 and
B = Pj and using the assumption dim ker(P0 −E0(P0)) = 1, there exist
a unit vector Ψj ∈ker(P0 −E0(P0)) and a real constant µj such that
PjΨj = µjΨj. It is obvious that Ψ0 = cjΨj for some constant cj ̸= 0.
Hence PjΨ0 = µjΨ0.
Theorem 8.3 tells us that, in a translation covariant QFT, a ground
state of the Hamiltonian P0 is a simultaneous eigenvector of the energy-
momentum operator P if the ground state is unique.
Corollary 8.1. Let (F, D, P, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a translation covariant QFT sat-
isfying (8.16) (hence P0 ≥0). Suppose that E0(P0) = 0 and P0 has a unique
ground state Ψ0: P0Ψ0 = 0. Then PjΨ0 = 0 (j = 1, . . . , d). In particular,
0 ∈σJ(P).
Proof. By Theorem 8.3, PjΨ0 = µjΨ0 for some µj ∈R (j = 1, . . . , d).
This implies that |P |Ψ0 =
qPd
j=1 µ2
jΨ0. By (8.16), 0 = ⟨Ψ0, P0Ψ0⟩≥
⟨Ψ0, |P |Ψ0⟩≥0. Hence ⟨Ψ0, |P |Ψ0⟩= 0. Hence
qPd
j=1 µ2
j = 0, which
implies that µj = 0, j = 1, . . . , d. Thus PjΨ0 = 0.
By the result in the preceding paragraph, we have EPµ({0})Ψ0 = Ψ0.
Hence
EP ({0})Ψ0 = EP ({0} × · · · × {0}

{z

(1+d) factors
)Ψ0
= EP0({0})EP1({0}) · · · EPd({0})Ψ0
= Ψ0.
Hence 0 ∈σJ(P).
Remark 8.5. Let (F, D, H, (ϕr(t, ·))t∈R,r=1,...,s) be a sharp-time QFT.
Suppose that there exists a d-tuple (P1, . . . , Pd) of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on F such that each Pj (j = 1, . . . , d) strongly commutes
with H and, for all t ∈R, a = (a1, . . . , ad) ∈Rd and f ∈S (Rd),

tion covariant sharp-time QFT.
8.8
Review of Some Aspects Related to the Theory of
Special Relativity
As is well known, there are two categories in classical ﬁeld theory, namely,
the relativistic ﬁelds and the non-relativistic ﬁelds. This kind of classiﬁca-
tion is possible in QFT too. In the rest of this book, we will discuss both
of relativistic and non-relativistic quantum ﬁelds. But, before doing that,
we still need some mathematical preliminaries.
8.8.1
Minkowski space-time
We ﬁrst recall a general concept of Minkowski space. Let V be a (1 + d)-
dimensional real vector space. A metric15 q : V × V →R on V is called a
Minkowski metric if there exists a basis (ǫµ)d
µ=0 on V such that
q(ǫµ, ǫν) = gµν,
µ, ν = 0, . . . , d,
where the matrix (gµν) is deﬁned as follows:
g00 = 1,
gjj = −1,
j = 1, . . . , d,
(8.18)
gµν = 0,
µ ̸= ν, µ, ν = 0, . . . , d.
(8.19)
It follows that, for all u = Pd
µ=0 uµǫµ ∈V and v = Pd
ν=0 vνǫν ∈V
(uµ, vν ∈R),
q(u, v) =
d
X
µ,ν=0
gµνuµvν.
As is easily seen, q is an indeﬁnite metric. The indeﬁnite metric space (V, q)
is called a (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space.
Remark 8.6. There are many Minkowski metrics on V . Indeed, for each
bijective linear mapping T on V (i.e.
T ∈GL(V )), the mapping qT :
V × V →R deﬁned by
qT (u, v) := q(T −1u, T −1v),
u, v ∈V
(8.20)
is a Minkowski metric, since qT (T ǫµ, T ǫν) = gµν and (T ǫµ)d
µ=0 is a basis
of V . Conversely, it is not diﬃcult to show that, for any Minkowski metric
15See Footnote 3.
 

452
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
q′ on V , there exists a T ∈GL(V ) such that q′ = qT . Note that T as a
mapping from the Minkowski space (V, q) onto (V, qT ) preserves the metric:
qT (T u, T v) = q(u, v), u, v ∈V . Hence (V, q) is isomorphic to (V, qT ). In
this sense, a Minkowski metric on V is essentially unique.
We now consider the case where V = R1+d and deﬁne a mapping gM :
R1+d × R1+d →R by
gM(x, y) := x0y0 −
d
X
j=1
xjyj,
x = (xµ)d
µ=0, y = (yµ)µ=0 ∈R1+d.
It is easy to see that gM is a metric on R1+d. Let {eµ}d
µ=0 be the standard
basis of R1+d:
e0 = (1, 0, . . ., 0),
e1 = (0, 1, 0, . . ., 0),
...
ed = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1).
Then
gM(eµ, eν) = gµν,
µ, ν = 0, . . . , d,
where (gµν) is deﬁned by (8.18) and (8.19).
Hence gM is a Minkowski
metric on R1+d. In what follows, we write
xy := gM(x, y),
x, y ∈M1+d,
and call it the Minkowski inner product of x and y, although it is
indeﬁnite.
In the special theory of relativity with space dimension d, the space-
time is taken to be the Minkowski space (R1+d, gM) in which each element
in R1+d represents a space-time point. The Minkowski space (R1+d, gM)
in this sense is called the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time.
We denote it by M1+d.
In this context, x0 (resp.
(x1, . . . , xd)) in x =
(x0, x1, . . . , xd) ∈M1+d is called the time (resp. space) component.
The (1 + d) × (1 + d) matrix
g := (gµν)
is called the metric matrix. It follows that
g2 = I1+d,
(8.21)
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
453
the (1 + d) × (1 + d) identity matrix. In terms of the metric matrix g, the
Minkowski inner product xy (x, y ∈M1+d) is written as
xy = x · gy = gx · y,
where x · y denotes the Euclidean inner product of R1+d:
x · y :=
d
X
µ=0
xµyµ.
We denote by (M1+d)∗the dual space of M1+d (i.e., the set of linear
functionals on M1+d). For each µ = 0, 1 . . . , d, the mapping f µ : M1+d →R
deﬁned by
f µ(x) := xµ,
x ∈M1+d,
is an element of (M1+d)∗. The {f µ}µ=0,...,d is a basis of (M1+d)∗and called
the dual basis of {eµ}d
µ=0.
Each x ∈M1+d is written as
x =
d
X
µ=0
xµeµ.
Hence, for all k ∈(M1+d)∗,
k(x) =
d
X
µ=0
k(eµ)xµ =

µ=0
kµf µ

(x),
where kµ := k(eµ), µ = 0, . . . , d. Hence
k =
d
X
µ=0
kµf µ.
The real number kµ denotes the µth component of k with respect to the
dual basis {f µ}d
µ=0. We have
k(x) =
d
X
µ=0
kµxµ.
We sometimes write this as kx or xk and call the mapping: (M1+d)∗×
M1+d ∋(k, x) 7→kx ∈R the natural bilinear form on (M1+d)∗× M1+d.
The dual space (M1+d)∗also is a Minkowski space with metric
kl := k0l0 −
d
X
j=1
kjlj,
k, l ∈(M1+d)∗.
 

454
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For each x ∈M1+d, the mapping x′ : M1+d →R deﬁned by
x′(y) := xy,
y ∈M1+d,
is an element of (M1+d)∗. Hence one can deﬁne a mapping ι : M1+d →
(M1+d)∗by
ι(x) := x′,
x ∈M1+d.
It is easy to see that ι is linear and bijective. Namely ι is an isomorphism
between M1+d and (M1+d)∗. The linear functional ι(x) is called the dual
element of x. Note that this concept is independent of the choice of the
basis of M1+d.16
It is easy to see that
x′ = x0f 0 −
d
X
j=1
xjf j.
Hence the coordinate representation (x′µ)d
µ=0 of x′ with respect to the basis
{f µ}d
µ=0 is given as follows:
x′0 = x0,
x′j = −xj, j = 1, . . . , d.
In terms of the metric matrix g, we have
x′µ =
d
X
ν=0
gµνxν.
In what follows, we use the symbol xµ for x′µ:
xµ :=
d
X
ν=0
gµνxν.
(8.22)
Then, as is seen from the above discussion, (xµ)d
µ= is the coordinate rep-
resentation of the dual element ι(x) of x ∈M1+d with respect to the basis
{f µ}d
µ=0. This clariﬁes the meaning of the change from (xµ)µ to (xµ)µ.
The matrix g is invertible with g−1 = g. We denote by gµν the (µ, ν)-
component of g−1:
g−1 = (gµν)µ,ν=0,...,d.
Then
d
X
ν=0
gµνgνρ = δµ

ν=0
gµνgνρ = δρ

metric (not necessarily positive deﬁnite).
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
455
where δρ
µ = δµρ is the Kronecker delta: δρ
µ = 1 for µ = ρ and δρ
µ = 0 for
µ ̸= ρ.
It follows from (8.22) and (8.23) that
xµ =

ν=0
gµνxν.
We have also
xy =
d
X
µ=o
xµyµ =

µ=o
xµyµ,
x, y ∈M1+d.
We deﬁne the symbol x2 by
x2 := xx = (x0)2 −
d
X
j=1
(xj)2.
In what follows, for notational simplicity, we use Einstein’s convention
for summation of object T ρλ···
µν··· with an index which appears only once at
the upper index part and the lower one respectively. For example,
T µλ···
µν··· :=
d
X
µ=0
T µλ···
µν··· .
Following this convention, we have
xy = xµyµ,
xµ = gµνxν,
xµ = gµνxν
etc.
The non-zero points in M1+d are classiﬁed into three categories:
A point x ∈M1+d is said to be time-like (resp. space-like) if x2 > 0
(resp. x2 < 0).
A point x ∈M1+d is said to be light-like if x2 = 0 and x ̸= 0.
The set {x ∈M1+d|x2 = 0} is called the light cone.
8.8.2
Lorentz group
A linear mapping Λ : M1+d →M1+d satisfying
(Λx)(Λy) = xy,
x, y ∈M1+d
(8.24)
is called a Lorentz transformation on M1+d. Namely a Lorentz transfor-
mation is a linear mapping on M1+d which preserves the Minkowski inner
product. It follows that Λ is injective and hence bijective.
We denote by L (1+d)) the set of Lorentz transformations on M1+d. It
is easy to see that L (1+d) is a group.
The group L (1+d) is called the
(1 + d)-dimensional Lorentz group.
 

456
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In general, for a linear mapping T on M1+d, we denote by T µ
ν (µ, ν =
0, 1, . . . , d) the (µ, ν)-component of the matrix representation of T with
respect to the standard basis {eµ}d
µ=0:
T eµ = T ν
µ eν,
µ = 0, 1, . . . , d
where Einstein’s convention on the summation of ν is used. Hence
(T x)µ = T µ
ν xν,
x ∈M1+d, µ = 0, 1, . . . , d.
In what follows, concerning Lorentz transformations Λ, we work with
matrix representations with respect to the standard basis {eµ}d
µ=0 and iden-
tify Λ with its matrix representation (Λµ
ν). Then condition(8.24) is equiv-
alent to the equation
tΛgΛ = g,
(8.25)
where tΛ denotes the transposed matrix of Λ.
Multiplying (8.25) by Λg from the left and by Λ−1g from the right and
using (8.21), we obtain
Λg tΛ = g.
(8.26)
This means that tΛ also is a Lorentz transformation, i.e., tΛ ∈L (1+d).
Taking the determinant of both sides on(8.25) and using det g ̸= 0 and
det tΛ = det Λ, we obtain det Λ2 = 1. Hence
det Λ = ±1.
Also, computing the (0, 0)-component of both sides on (8.25) gives the
equation

Among these subsets, only L ↑
+ forms a subgroup of L (1+d). The subgroup
L ↑
+ is called the proper or restricted Lorentz group.
An element of L ↑
+ is called a proper or restricted Lorentz trans-
formation.
The following proposition shows that any proper Lorentz transformation
preserves the sign of the time component of a time-like vector:
Proposition 8.4. Let x ∈M1+d be a time-like vector and Λ ∈L ↑
+.
(i) If x0 > 0, then (Λx)0 > 0.
(ii) If x0 < 0, then (Λx)0 < 0.

(ii) In the present case, y := −x is a time-like vector with y0 > 0.
Hence, by (i), (Λy)0 > 0. But Λy = −Λx. Hence (Λx)0 < 0.

Dual operators on (M1+d)∗
For a linear operator T on M1+d, the linear operator T ′ : (M1+d)∗→
(M1+d)∗deﬁned by
(T ′k)(x) := k(T x),
k ∈(M1+d)∗, x ∈M1+d
is called the dual operator of T . It is easy to see that
T ′k = T µ
ν kµf ν,
k = kµf µ ∈(M1+d)∗.
Hence
(T ′k)ν = T µ
ν kµ.
It follows from (8.26) that, for all Λ ∈L (1+d),
(Λ′k)(Λ′l) = kl,
k, l ∈(M1+d)∗,
i.e., Λ′ is a Lorentz transformation on (M1+d)∗.

+ is a linear Lie group (see Appendix F). Hence its
Lie algebra exists. We denote it by l↑
+:
l↑
+ := {X ∈M1+d(R)|etX ∈L ↑
+, ∀t ∈R}.
An explicit form of this Lie algebra is given as follows:
Proposition 8.5.
l↑
+ = {X ∈M1+d(R)|tXg + gX = 0}.
(8.28)
In particular,
dim l↑
+ = d(d + 1)
2
.
(8.29)
Proof. Let X ∈l↑
+. Then, for all s ∈R, t(esX)gesX = g, which is equiva-
lent to estXgesX = g, ∀s ∈R. Diﬀerentiating the both sides in s at s = 0,
we have
tXg + gX = 0.
(8.30)
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields

Conversely, suppose that X ∈M1+d(R) satisﬁes (8.30). Then tX =
g(−X)g. Hence, using g2 = I1+d, we have for all s ∈R
estX = esg(−X)g = ge−sXg.
This implies that estXgesX = g.
Since estX = t(esX), it follows that
esX ∈L (1+d). Hence (det esX)2 = 1. Since esX is continuous in s and
det e0X = 1, (e0X)0
0 = 1, it follows that det esX = 1 and (esX)0
0 ≥1, s ∈R.
Hence esX ∈L ↑
+, s ∈R. Thus (8.28) holds.
Let X ∈l↑
+ and Y := gX. Then, by (8.30), Y = −tY . This means that
Y is anti-symmetric. Hence Y = P
0≤µ<ν≤d Y µ
ν eν
µ, where Y µ
ν is the (µ, ν)
component of Y and eν
µ (µ < ν) is the anti-symmetric matrix satisfying
(eν

β = δµαδνβ −δµβδνα (α, β = 0, . . . , d). Hence
X = gY =
X
0≤µ<ν≤d
Y µ

µ.
It is easy to see that geν
µ ∈l↑
+ and {geν
µ}0≤µ<ν≤d is a set of linearly in-
dependent matrices. The cardinal number of this set is d(d + 1)/2. Thus
(8.29) follows.
8.8.5
Poincar´e group
The set
P(1+d) := {(a, Λ)|a ∈R1+d, Λ ∈L (1+d)}
is a group with the following operation:
(a2, Λ2)(a1, Λ1) := (a2 + Λ2a1, Λ2Λ1),
a1, a2 ∈R1+d, Λ1, Λ2 ∈L (1+d).
The group P(1+d) is called the (1 + d)-dimensional Poincar´e group.
Each element (a, Λ) ∈P(1+d) can be regarded as a transformation on
M1+d deﬁned by
(a, Λ)x := Λx + a,
x ∈M1+d.
Under this identiﬁcation, the product of two elements in P(1+d) is the
composition of those as transformations and P(1+d) is a transformation
group on M1+d.
The group P(1+d) is a topological group such that the convergence of
a sequence is deﬁned as follows. A sequence {(an, Λn)}n in P(1+d) is said
to converge to (a, Λ) ∈P(1+d) if limn→∞|an −a| = and limn→∞(Λn)µ
ν =
Λµ
ν, µ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d. In this case we write limn→∞(an, Λn) = (a, Λ).
It is easy to see that the subset
P↑
+ := {(a, Λ)|a ∈R1+d, Λ ∈L ↑
+}
 

460
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
of P(1+d) is a subgroup of P(1+d). This subgroup is called the (1 + d)-
dimensional proper or restricted Poincar´e group.
The Lorentz group L (1+d) and the translation group R1+d can be iden-
tiﬁed with the subgroup {(0, Λ)|Λ ∈L (1+d)} and {(a, I)|a ∈R1+d} of the
Poincar´e group P(1+d) respectively.17
8.9
Axioms for Relativistic QFT
Schematically speaking, a translation covariant QFT discussed in Section
8.7 becomes a relativistic QFT (RQFT) if it gets a structure coming from
principles of special relativity in accordance with quantum mechanics. As
is well known, the special theory of relativity is based on the following two
principles:
(R.1) Invariance of light speed c (causality).
(R.2) Poincar´e covariance (special relativity).
By incorporating these principles into the idea of QFT in a suitable manner,
one obtains a set of axioms for a RQFT. Four kinds of axioms for a RQFT
have been proposed so far: (i) the G˚arding-Wightman axioms (1954); (ii)
the Wightman axioms (1956); (iii) the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms (1973);
(iv) the Nelson axioms (1973). The ﬁrst two formulate minimum properties
that a RQFT on the four-dimensional Minkowski space-time M4 (more gen-
erally the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time M1+d) should satisfy,
while the last two are concerned with formulations of a Euclidean QFT,
a QFT on the Euclidean space R4, which is heuristically obtained by an
analytic continuation of a RQFT on M4 to a region consisting of points
in C4 whose time component is purely imaginary. Below we outline these
axioms.
Remark 8.7. The axioms for relativistic quantum ﬁelds presented below
are of trial nature, because, in the case of 4-dimensional space-time, any
non-trivial model satisfying the axioms has not yet been shown to exist,
where a “non-trivial model” means that it is not equivalent to a free quan-
tum ﬁeld (for free quantum ﬁelds, see Chapters 10–12; it is shown that
relativistic free quantum ﬁelds obey the axioms). To show existence of a
non-trivial relativistic quantum ﬁeld model on the 4-dimensional space-time
17Strictly speaking, L (1+d) (resp. R1+d) is isomorphic to {(0, Λ)|Λ ∈L (1+d)} (resp.
{(a, I)|a ∈R1+d}) under the mapping:Λ 7→(0, Λ) (resp. a 7→(a, I)).

is left as a very diﬃcult open problem which is closely related to one of the
millennium problems [Jaﬀe and Witten (2000)].
In what follows, we use the physical unit system where c = 1 unless
otherwise stated.
8.9.1
The G˚arding-Wightman axioms
We ﬁrst discuss the G˚arding-Wightman axioms. There may be many kinds
of quantum ﬁelds corresponding to those of classical ﬁelds. For simplicity,
we restrict ourselves to the case of a neutral (Hermitian) quantum scalar
ﬁeld on the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time M1+d.18
A neutral (or Hermitian) quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on M1+d is
deﬁned to be a quintuple (H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) consisting of a separable inﬁnite
dimensional Hilbert space H , a strongly continuous unitary representation
U of P↑
+ on H , an operator-valued distribution φ on R1+d with values in
L(H ), a common domain D of φ and a unit vector Ψ0 ∈H , satisfying the
following (GW.1)–(GW.5):
(GW.1) (quantum ﬁeld)
(a) For each f ∈S (R1+d), φ(f)D ⊂D.
(b) (Hermiticity) If f ∈S (R1+d) is a real-valued, then φ(f) ↾D is
a symmetric operator.
The operator-valued distribution φ is called the neutral (Hermitian)
quantum scalar ﬁeld.
(GW.2) (Poincar´e covariance)
(U.1) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+, U(a, Λ)D ⊂D.
(U.2) For all f ∈S (R1+d) and (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
U(a, Λ)φ(f)U(a, Λ)−1 = φ(f(a,Λ))
on D,
(8.31)
where
f(a,Λ)(x) = f(Λ−1(x −a)),
x ∈R1+d.
(8.32)
(U.3) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
U(a, Λ)Ψ0 = Ψ0.
(8.33)
The vector Ψ0 is called the vacuum.
Such a vector Ψ0 is
unique up to constant multiples, i.e., if a vector Ψ ∈H satis-
ﬁes U(a, Λ)Ψ = Ψ for all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+, then Ψ = αΨ0 for some
α ∈C.
18For axioms for a more general quantum ﬁeld, see, e.g., [Bogoliubov et al. (1975);
Streater and Wightman (1964)].

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that R1+d ∋a 7→U(a, I) is a strongly continuous unitary
representation of the translation group R1+d. Hence, by Lemma 8.2, there
exists a (1 + d)-tuple P := (Pµ)d
µ=0 of strongly commuting self-adjoint
operators on H such that
U(a, I) = eia0P0/ℏeia1P1/ℏ· · · eiadPd/ℏ,
a ∈R1+d.
(8.34)
The operator vector P is called the energy-momentum operator of the
QFT under consideration.
Since the (1 + d)-tuple P is strongly commuting, it follows from a gen-
eral theory of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators that Pµ and Pν
commute:
[Pµ, Pν] = 0
(8.35)
on D(PµPν) ∩D(PνPµ).
The energy-momentum space in the special theory of relativity is given
by
M1+d
p
:= {ℏk|k ∈(M1+d)∗}.
(GW.3) (spectral condition) Let
V+ := {p = (p0, p1, . . . , pd) ∈M1+d
p
|p0 > 0, p2 > 0},
(8.36)
called the forward light cone. Then the joint spectrum σJ(P) is a
subset of V + (the closure of V+):
σJ(P) ⊂V + = {p ∈M1+d
p
|p0 ≥0, p2 ≥0}.
(8.37)
(GW.4) (locality or microscopic causality) If supp f (the support
of f ∈S (R1+d)) is space-like separated from supp g (g ∈S (R1+d)),
i.e., (x −y)2 < 0 for all x ∈supp f and y ∈supp g, then φ(f) and φ(g)
commute on D:
[φ(f), φ(g)]Ψ = 0,
Ψ ∈D.
(GW.5) (cyclicity
of
the
vacuum) The subspace D
is alge-
braically spanned by Ψ0 and vectors φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ψ0 (n ∈N, fj ∈
S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n):
D = span {Ψ0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ψ0| f1, . . . , fn ∈S (R1+d), n ≥1}.
The properties (GW.1)–(GW.5) are called the G˚arding-Wightman
axioms.
Some comments on these axioms may be in order.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
463
Property (GW.1)-(a) is just a property that a quantum ﬁeld should
posses (see Deﬁnition 8.2(QF.1)), while (GW.1)-(b) reﬂects the speciality
that the quantum ﬁeld is neutral. A neutral (classical or quantum) ﬁeld
means that it has no electric charge. A neutral classical scalar ﬁeld on
M1+d is given by a real-valued function φcl on M1+d. Hence, for all f ∈
SR(R1+d) := {f ∈S (R1+d)|f is real-valued},
R
R1+d φcl(x)f(x)dx is a real
number.
Corresponding to this fact, the expectation value of a neutral
quantum scalar ﬁeld φ(f) in any physical state should be a real number
if f is real-valued. The subspace D in the G˚arding-Wightman axioms is
interpreted to be included in the subspace of physical states. Hence, for all
Ψ ∈D and f ∈SR(R1+d) , ⟨Ψ, φ(f)Ψ⟩should be a real number. This is
equivalent to (GW.1)-(b).
A proper Poincar´e transformation (a, Λ), which is a transformation on
the space-time M1+d, should accompany a transformation on the state
space.
This transformation is U(a, Λ).
The unitarity of U(a, Λ) is due
to the requirement that such a transformation on the state space should
preserve the transition probability between any two states and Wigner’s
theorem.19 Since U is a representation of P↑
+, it obeys the following com-
position law: for all (a1, Λ1), (a2, Λ2) ∈P↑
+,
U(a2, Λ2)U(a1, Λ1) = U(Λ2a1 + a2, Λ2Λ1).
(8.38)
In particular, for all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
U(a, Λ)−1 = U(−Λ−1a, Λ−1).
(8.39)
Property (U.2) is a transformation law of the quantum ﬁeld φ under
proper Poincar´e transformations. The deﬁnition of the function f(a,Λ) given
by (8.32) is obviously extended to any function f ∈L2(R1+d). It is easy to
see that, for all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈L2(R1+d), f(a,Λ) is in L2(R1+d) and
∥f(a,Λ)∥= ∥f∥.
Hence the mapping u(a, Λ) on L2(R1+d) deﬁned by
u(a, Λ)f := f(a,Λ),
f ∈L2(R1+d)
(8.40)
19Wigner’s theorem. Let H be a Hilbert space with dim H ≥2 and T be a mapping
on H such that, for all Φ, Ψ ∈H , | ⟨TΦ, TΨ⟩| = | ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩|. Then there exists a linear
isometry TL on H (i.e., TL is a linear operator on H satisfying ∥TLΨ∥= ∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈
H ) or an anti-linear isometry TA (i.e., TA is an anti-linear operator on H satisfying
∥TAΨ∥= ∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈H ) such that TΨ = eiθL(Ψ)TLΨ, Ψ ∈H or TΨ = eiθA(Ψ)TAΨ, Ψ ∈
H , where θL(Ψ) and θA(Ψ) are real constants which may depend on Ψ.
A detailed
proof of this theorem is given in [Arai and Ezawa (1999b)] (cf. also [Wigner (1959)]).
 

464
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is a linear isometry. For all (a2, Λ2), (a1, Λ1) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈L2(R1+d),
(u(a2, Λ2)u(a1, Λ1)f)(x) = (u(a1, Λ1)f)(Λ−1
2 (x −a2))
= f(Λ−1
1 (Λ−1
2 (x −a2) −a1))
= f((Λ2Λ1)−1(x −Λ2a1 −a2))
= f(Λ2a1+a2,Λ2Λ1)(x)
= (u((a2, Λ2)(a1, Λ1))f)(x),
a.e.x ∈R1+d.
Hence
u(a2, Λ2)u(a1, Λ1) = u((a2, Λ2)(a1, Λ1)).
(8.41)
In particular,
u(a, Λ)u(−Λ−1a, Λ−1) = u(0, I) = I.
Hence u(a, Λ) is surjective. Thus u(a, Λ) is unitary.
By using the Lebesgue dominated convergence, one can easily show that,
for all f, g ∈C∞
0 (R1+d), the mapping: (a, Λ) 7→⟨g, u(a, Λ)f⟩is continuous.
Hence, by Lemma 8.3, u(a, Λ) is strongly continuous in (a, Λ). Thus we
arrive at the following theorem.
Theorem 8.4. The mapping u : P↑
+ →U(L2(R1+d)) : (a, Λ) 7→u(a, Λ) is
a strongly continuous unitary representation of P↑
+.
We note that, if fn, f ∈S (R1+d), fn
S→f (n →∞), then u(a, Λ)fn
S→
u(a, Λ)f (n →∞).
Hence the mapping u(a, Λ)′φ : S (R1+d) →L(H )
deﬁned by
(u(a, Λ)′φ)(f) := φ(u(a, Λ)f),
f ∈S (R1+d)
is an operator-valued distribution. We call u(a, Λ)′φ the Poincar´e trans-
form of the quantum ﬁeld φ associated with (a, Λ).
Equation (8.31) is written
U(a, Λ)φU(a, Λ)−1 = u(a, Λ)′φ
on D.
(8.42)
By this property, the quantum ﬁeld φ is said to be unitarily imple-
mentable under the action of the proper Poincar´e group P↑
+.
In terms of the operator-valued distribution kernel φ(x) of φ (φ(f) =
R
R1+d φ(x)f(x)dx), (8.31) is symbolically written
U(a, Λ)φ(x)U(a, Λ)−1 = φ(Λx + a).
In a physical picture, a vacuum is supposed to be a state in which there
exist no observed elementary particles or no visible matters in the space-
time. In such a state, every point in the space-time would be on an equal
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
465
footing. Therefore a vacuum should be a state invariant under all proper
Poincar´e transformations. This requirement is (U.3).
The joint spectrum σJ(P) of P is interpreted as the set of measured
values of the energy-momentum P. In the special theory of relativity, an
energy-momentum vector of a “normal” motion (time-like motion) is time-
like and the energy component is non-negative. Hence (8.37) is a natural
condition.
In the special theory of relativity, space-like separated points are
causally independent. Hence ﬁeld measurements should be mutually in-
dependent if they are made at those points. On the other hand, indepen-
dence of quantum mechanical observables is expressed as the commutativity
of them. This is a physical meaning of property (GW.4).
Physically a quantum ﬁeld is supposed to have the function that creates
elementary particles from the vacuum or annihilates them into the vacuum.
Each state may be described by a conﬁguration of elementary particles
whose number is ﬁnite and such a state may be given by a ﬁnite linear
combination of the vacuum Ψ0 and vectors of the form φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ψ0
(n ∈N, fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n). This is a physical picture behind
property (GW.5).
Let us see some consequences derived from (GW.1)–(GW.5).
Proposition
8.6. The vacuum Ψ0 is a simultaneous eigenvector of
P0, . . . , Pd with eigenvalue 0:
PµΨ0 = 0,
µ = 0, 1, . . . , d.
In particular, 0 ∈σJ(P).
Proof. By (8.33) and (8.34), we have for all t ∈R and µ = 0, 1, . . ., d
eitPµΨ0 = Ψ0.
By considering the strong diﬀerentiation of the both sides at t = 0, one sees
that Ψ0 ∈D(Pµ) and PµΨ0 = 0.
Proposition 8.7. P0 ≥|P |.
Proof. This follows from (GW.3) and an application of Proposition 8.3
with γ = 1.
Since each point of the joint spectrum σJ(P) of P is considered as a point
in (M1+d)∗, it is natural to assume that, for any Lorentz transformation Λ
 

466
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
on M1+d, the operator vector P is transformed by the dual operator Λ′ as
Λ′P:
Λ′P = (Λµ
0Pµ, Λµ
1Pµ, . . . , Λµ
dPµ).
Since P is strongly commuting, (Λ′P)µ = Λν
µPν is essentially self-adjoint
for all µ = 0, 1, . . . , d. Moreover, the (1 + d)-tuple
Λ′P := (Λµ
0Pµ, Λµ
1Pµ, . . . , Λµ
dPµ)
of self-adjoint operators is strongly commuting, where Λµ
νPµ denotes the
closure of Λµ
νPµ.
The strong commutativity of P implies that, for all a ∈R1+d,
aP := a0P0 +
d
X
j=1
ajPj
is essentially self-adjoint and
eiaP /ℏ= eia0P0/ℏeia1P1/ℏ· · · eiadPd/ℏ.
Hence
U(a, I) = eiaP /ℏ.
(8.43)
Proposition 8.8 (transformation law of the energy-momentum).
For all Λ ∈L ↑
+,
U(0, Λ)PµU(0, Λ)−1 = (Λ′P)µ,
µ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
(8.44)
Proof. For all a ∈R1+d, we have by (8.38) and (8.39)
U(0, Λ)U(a, I)U(0, Λ)−1 = U(Λa, I).
Hence
U(0, Λ)eiaP /ℏU(0, Λ)−1 = ei(Λa)P /ℏ= eia(Λ′P )/ℏ.
Taking a = teµ ∈R1+d, t ∈R, one has
U(0, Λ)eitPµ/ℏU(0, Λ)−1 = eit(Λ′P )µ/ℏ.
Hence (8.44) follows.
As a corollary to Proposition 8.8, we ﬁnd the following natural fact:
Corollary 8.2. (Lorentz invariance of the energy-momentum spectrum)
For all Λ ∈L ↑
+,
Λ′σJ(P) = σJ(P).
(8.45)
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
467
Proof. Let S = Λ′σJ(P). Then it is easy to see that S is a closed set. By
the spectral mapping theorem,
σJ(Λ′P) = S = S.
(8.46)
On the other hand, by (8.44),
σJ(Λ′P) = σJ(P),
which, together with (8.46), gives (8.45).
One can derive the equations of motion for the quantum ﬁeld φ:
Theorem 8.5. Suppose that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) D ⊂D(Pµ), µ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
(ii) For all f ∈S (R1+d) and µ = 0, 1, . . ., d, PµD ⊂D(φ(f)).
(iii) For all Ψ ∈D and µ = 0, 1 . . ., d, f ∈S (R1+d), the H -valued
function :R ∋t →φ(f)eitPµΨ is strongly continuous.
Then, for all Ψ ∈D, f ∈S (R1+d) and n ∈N,
Dn
µφ(f)Ψ = i
ℏ[Pµ, Dn−1
µ
φ(f)]Ψ
(µ = 0, 1, . . ., d).
(8.47)
Proof. Putting Λ = I in (8.31) and a = teµ (t ∈R), we have
eitPµ/ℏφ(f)e−itPµ/ℏ= φ(f(teµ,I)),
on D.
Hence one can apply Theorem 8.1 to obtain the desired result.
8.9.2
Angular momentum
In this subsection we show how the concept of angular momentum appears
in the framework of the G˚arding-Wightman axioms. For each Λ ∈L ↑
+, we
set
U0(Λ) := U(0, Λ).
Then U0 : L ↑
+ →U(H ) is a strongly continuous unitary representation of
L ↑
+.
For 1 ≤j, k ≤d, j ̸= k, and θ ∈R, a mapping Rjk(θ) on M1+d is deﬁned
by
(Rjk(θ)x)µ := xµ,
µ ̸= j, k,
(Rjk(θ)x)j := xj cos θ −xk sin θ,
(Rjk(θ)x)k := xj sin θ + xk cos θ,
x ∈M1+d.
 

468
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is easy to see that Rjk(θ) ∈L ↑
+. Geometrically Rjk(θ) means the Eu-
clidean rotation of angle θ around the origin in the xj-xk plane.
Also we deﬁne R0j(θ) ∈L ↑
+ (j = 1, . . . , d) by
(R0j(θ)x)µ := xµ,
µ ̸= 0, j,
(R0j(θ)x)0 := x0 cosh θ + xj sinh θ,
(R0j(θ)x)j := x0 sinh θ + xj cosh θ.
Geometrically R0j(θ) means the Lorentz rotation of angle θ around the
origin in the x0-xj plane. Also we introduce Rj0(θ) ∈L ↑
+ by
Rj0(θ) := R0j(−θ),
θ ∈R.
As is easily seen, for each (µ, ν) (µ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d, µ ̸= ν), {Rµν(θ)}θ∈R
is a subgroup of L ↑
+ and {U0(Rµν(θ))}θ∈R is a strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group on H . Hence, by Stone’s theorem, there exists a
unique self-adjoint operator M µν on H such that
U0(Rµν(θ)) = e−iθMµν/ℏ.
(8.48)
We set
M µµ := 0,
, µ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
Since Rµν(−θ) = Rνµ(θ), it follows that
M µν = −M νµ,
µ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d, µ ̸= ν.
The d(d + 1)/2-tuple (M µν)0≤µ<ν≤d is called the angular momentum
of the quantum ﬁeld φ. In particular, we call (M jk)1≤j<k≤d the orbital
angular momentum.
We ﬁrst note the following important fact:
Theorem 8.6 (conservation of the orbital angular momentum).
For all t ∈R and j, k = 1, . . . , d,
eitP0/ℏM jke−itP0/ℏ= M jk.
(8.49)
Proof. Let θ ∈R. Then
eitP0/ℏe−iθMjk/ℏe−itP0/ℏ= U(te0, I)U(0, Rjk(θ))U(−te0, I)
= U(te0 −tRjk(θ)e0, Rjk(θ)).
But Rjk(θ)e0 = e0. Hence the last operator in the above equation is equal
to U(0, Rjk(θ)) = e−iθMjk/ℏ. Therefore
eitP0/ℏe−iθMjk/ℏe−itP0/ℏ= e−iθMjk/ℏ.
By this equation and the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we ob-
tain (8.49).

Let us calculate commutation relations among M µν’s and P µ’s (recall
that P µ := gµνPν).
Theorem 8.7. Suppose that D ⊂D(M µνPλ)∩D(PλM µν) for all µ, ν, λ =
0, . . . , d. Then, for all µ, ν, λ = 0, . . . , d,
[M µν, P λ] = −iℏ(gµλP ν −gνλP µ)
(8.50)
on D.
Proof. Let Φ, Ψ ∈D and j, k, ℓ= 1, . . . .d, µ = 0, 1, . . ., d. Then, by (8.44),
we have

Hence it follows that
[M jk, P0]Ψ = 0,
[M jk, Pℓ]Ψ = iℏ(δj

Similarly one can show that
[M 0j, Pℓ]Ψ = 0 (ℓ̸= j),
[M 0j, P0]Ψ = iℏPjΨ,
[M 0j, Pj]Ψ = iℏP0Ψ.
(8.52)
Rewriting these equations with P0 = P 0 and Pj = −P j (j = 1, . . . , d), we
obtain (8.50).
The (0, j) component M 0j of the angular momentum is not conserved,
but, the time-development of it obeys a simple beautiful formula:
Theorem 8.8. Suppose that the same assumption as in Theorem 8.7 holds
and that D ∩E (P0) is dense in H , where E (P0) is the set of entire analytic
vectors of P0 (see Subsection 1.7). Then, for all t ∈R and j = 1, . . . , d,
eitP0/ℏM 0je−itP0/ℏ= M 0j + tPj
on D ∩E (P0).

Since D ∩E (P0) is dense by the present assumption, (8.53) follows.
With regard to commutation relations of M µν’s, we give only a remark.
For r ∈N, we denote by Mr(K) the set of r ×r matrices whose components
are elements of K (K = R or C).
For all µ, ν = 0, 1, . . ., d, we deﬁne
mµν ∈M1+d(C) by
(mµν)α
β := iℏ(gµαδν
β −gναδµ
β),
µ, ν = 0, . . . , d.
Then it is easy to see that, for all θ ∈R,
Rµν(θ) = e−iθmµν/ℏ.
(8.55)
By direct computations, one can show that the following commutation re-
lations hold:
[mµν, mρσ] = −iℏ(gµρmνσ −gµσmνρ −gνρmµσ + gνσmµρ).
By (8.55), −imµν ∈l↑
+. It is easy to see that the set {−imµν|0 ≤µ < ν ≤d}
is linearly independent and the number of the elements in it is d(d + 1)/2.
Thus it is a basis of l↑
+.

By (8.48) and (8.55), we have
U0(e−iθmµν) = e−iθMµν,
µ, ν = 0, . . . , d, θ ∈R.
Hence, by analogy with the theory of ﬁnite dimensional representations of
Lie algebras, the correspondence: imµν 7→iM µν may give an inﬁnite di-
mensional representation of the Lie algebra l↑
+. But it would need more
conditions for U0(Λ) to justify this scheme in general, since each M µν may
be unbounded. If the scheme is justiﬁed, then one can expect that M µν’s
satisfy the same commutation relation as those of mµν’s on a suitable sub-
space:
[M µν, M ρσ] = −iℏ(gµρM νσ −gµσM νρ −gνρM µσ + gνσM µρ)
(8.56)
on a subspace. For a structure related to this aspect, see Problem 3.

(8.35),
(8.50)
and
(8.56)
suggest
that
{P µ, Mµν|µ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d} may be a representation of a Lie algebra. This
Lie algebra is called the Poincar´e algebra associated with M1+d.
8.9.3
Wightman axioms
Let (H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) be a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on M1+d.
Then, by a general theory in Section 8.5, for each n ∈N, there exists a
unique tempered distribution Wn on (R1+d)n such that, for all f1, . . . , fn ∈
S (R1+d),
Wn(f1 × · · · × fn) = ⟨Ψ0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ψ0⟩.
(8.57)
The tempered distribution Wn is called the n-point Wightman distri-
bution for the quantum ﬁeld φ. The distribution kernel of Wn is denoted
Wn(x1, . . . , xn):
Wn(f) =
Z
Wn(x1, . . . , xn)f(x1, . . . , xn)dx1 · · · dxn.
In terms of the operator-valued distribution kernel φ(x) of the quantum
ﬁeld φ, Wn(x1, . . . , xn) is written
Wn(x1, . . . , xn) = ⟨Ψ0, φ(x1) · · · φ(xn)Ψ0⟩
as a symbolical expression for (8.57).
One can characterize a QFT in terms of Wightman distributions instead
of using a Hilbert space and operators acting in it. This approach leads one
to the following axioms [Wightman (1956); Streater and Wightman (1964)].
A neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory is a sequence {Wn ∈
S ′(R(1+d)n)}∞
n=0
(W0 := 1) of tempered distributions satisfying the fol-
lowing (W.1)–(W.6):

taken in the sense of tempered distribution, i.e., as the equality in the
form smeared by any f ∈S (R(1+d)n):
Wn(f) = Fn−1( ˜fn−1),

λ→∞Wn(f × g(λa,0)) = Wj(f)Wn−j(g).
These axioms are called the Wightman axioms.
It is not so diﬃcult to show that the Wightman distributions {Wn}∞
n=0
(W0 := 1) deﬁned by (8.57) in a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory
(H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) satisfy the Wightman axioms.20
Conversely, for each sequence {Wn}∞
n=0 with Wn ∈S ′(R(1+d)n) satisfy-
ing the Wightman axioms, there exists a quintuple (H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) obeying
the G˚arding-Wightman axioms such that its Wightman distributions are
equal to {Wn}∞
n=0, and it is unique up to unitary equivalents. This fact is
called Wightman’s reconstruction theorem.21
In this way, it is shown that the G˚arding-Wightman axioms and the
Wightman axioms are equivalent (Fig. 8.1).

to be Poincar´e (resp. Lorentz) invariant if, for all f ∈S (R(1+d)n) and

In terms of distribution kernel T (x1, . . . , xn) of T , the Poincar´e invariance
of T is symbolically expressed as
T (Λx1 + a, . . . , Λxn + a) = T (x1, . . . , xn).
The case a = 0 in this equation gives the symbolical expression of the
Lorentz invariance of T . Axiom (W.2) is rephrased as follows: for all n ≥1,
Wn is Poincar´e invariant.
8.9.4
The Osterwalder–Schrader axioms
The theory of functions of complex variables tells us that the essence of a
function may become apparent only after all possible analytic continuations
of it are found. This idea may be applicable to tempered distributions too.
From this point of view, one is naturally led to consider analytic continua-
tions of Wightman distributions and may expect to obtain a set of axioms
for a QFT in terms of objects diﬀerent from Wightman distributions. Below
we describe how this procedure is done and what kind of axioms appear.
One can show by using the relativistic invariance, the spectral condition
and the locality in the Wightman axioms that each Wightman distribution
Wn can be analytically continued to a function on the subset
{((it1, x1), . . . , (itn, xn)) | tj ∈R, xj ∈Rd, (itj, xj) ̸= (itk, xk)
j ̸= k, j, k = 1, . . . , n}
in C(1+d)n := C1+d × · · · × C1+d (the n direct product of C1+d).22 This
subset is called the non-coincident Euclidean region. As is seen, the an-
alytic continuation makes the time components of space-time points purely
imaginary ones.
For this reason it is called the anaytic continuation to
purely imaginary times. On the level of the space-time, this analytic con-
tinuation changes the Minkoswki space-time metric to the Euclidean one.
In this sense the analytic continuation is called the Euclideanization of
the Wightman distributions. Let us denote the analytic continuation of Wn
by the same symbol Wn and introduce a sequence {Sn}∞
n=0 of functions as
follows: S0 := 1 and
Sn((t1, x1), . . . (tn, xn)) := Wn((it1, x1), . . . , (itn, xn)).
It is shown that, for all n ∈N, Sn is a real analytic function on the domain
En := {(y1, . . . , yn) ∈R(1+d)n|yj ̸= yk, j ̸= k, j, k = 1, . . . , n}.
(8.60)
22For the details, see, e.g., [Ezawa and Arai (1988), Chapter 2], [Osterwalder and
Schrader (1973, 1975)] and [Simon (1974)].
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
475
Ths function Sn is called the n-point Schwinger function or n-point
Euclidean Green’s function.
Properties of the Wightman distributions have their correspondents in
the Schwinger functions. To describe them, we need some notations.
Let
S̸=(R(1+d)n) := {f ∈S (R(1+d)n)|for all multi-indices α, ∂αf = 0 on
the hypersurface yj = yk(j ̸= k, j, k = 1, . . . , n)}.
We consider the space S̸=(R(1+d)n) as a topological space with respect
to the relative topology in S (R(1+d)n) and denote by S ′
̸=(R(1+d)n) the
set of continuous linear functionals on S̸=(R(1+d)n). We also introduce a
subset of S̸=(R(1+d)n):
S+(R(1+d)n) :=
n
f ∈S̸=(R(1+d)n)|supp f ⊂(R(1+d)n)+
o
,
where
(R(1+d)n)+ := {((t1, x1), . . . , (tn, xn)) ∈R(1+d)n|0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn}.
One can prove that the sequence {Sn}∞
n=0 of the Schwinger functions
has the following properties (OS.1)–(OS.5)23:
(OS.1) (temperedness and Hermiticity) For each n ≥1, Sn ∈
S ′
̸=(R(1+d)n) and, for all f ∈S̸=(R(1+d)n)
Sn(f) = Sn(θf †),
where
Sn(f) =

(θf)((t1, x1), . . . , (tn, xn)) = f((−t1, x1), . . . , (−tn, xn)),
and f † is deﬁned by (8.58).
(OS.2) (Euclidean invariance) For all a ∈R1+d and R ∈SO(1 + d)
(the (1 + d)-dimensional Euclidean rotation group24)
Sn(f) = Sn(f(a,R)),
f ∈S̸=(R(1+d)n),
where
f(a,R)(y1, . . . , yn) := f(R−1(y1 −a), . . . , R−1(yn −a)),
y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈R(1+d)n.

From the Wightman axioms to the Osterwalde-Schrader axioms
From an axiomatic point of view, forgetting about the Wightman ax-
ioms, one may deﬁne a neutral quantm scalar ﬁeld theory as a sequence
{Sn}∞
n=0 satisfying (OS.1)–(OS.5).
In this scheme, properties (OS.1)–
(OS.5) are called the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms and, for any se-
quence {Sn}∞
n=0 satisfying (OS.1)–(OS.5), Sn’s are called the Schwinger
functions. Then it is natural to ask if the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms
imply the Wightman axioms or the G˚arding-Wightman axioms. In fact,
this involves some subtle problems technically. If the condition of the tem-
peredness in (OS.1) is strengthened a little, then one can construct a se-
quence of tempered distributions satisfying the Wightman axioms from a
sequence of Schwinger functions obeying the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms
(Osterwalder-Schrader’s reconstruction theorem25).
25For the details, see [Osterwalder and Schrader (1973, 1975)] and [Simon (1974)]. Zi-

Relations among the three sets of axioms
The Osterwalder–Schrader axioms are not only interesting from purely
theoretical points of view but also useful for constructing relativistic quan-
tum ﬁeld models. This is suggested by the following considerations.
The equation of motion which a relativistic quantum ﬁeld (φr)s
r=1 on
the Minkowski space-time M1+d obeys is of the following form in many
cases:
□+
mc
ℏ
2
φr(x) = Fr(φ1(x), . . . , φs(x), ∇φ1(x), . . . , ∇φs(x)),
x ∈M1+d, where c is the light speed (we have recovered it here),
□:= DµDµ = D2

X

(8.61)
is the (1 + d)-dimensional d’Alembertian with distributional partial diﬀer-
ential operators Dµ, µ = 0, . . . , d (the operator □in this sense is called the
generalized (1 + d)-dimensional d’Alembertian),
∇:= (D0, D1, . . . , Dd),
m ≥0 is a constant and Fr is a function on Rs × R(1+d)s. These equations
are of hyperbolic type.
noviev [Zinoviev (1995)] discovered a revised version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms
which is completely equivalent to the Wightman axioms.
 

478
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
If one replaces the time component x0 in x ∈M1+d by the purely
imaginary time ix0, then one sees that the partial diﬀerential operator
□+ (mc/ℏ)2 changes to −∆+ (mc/ℏ)2, where ∆= Pd
µ=0 D2
µ is the
generalized (1 + d)-dimensional Laplacian. Hence, schematically, by the
analytic continuation to the non-coincident Euclidean region, the quan-
tum ﬁeld φr on the Minkowski space-time may “metamorphose” into a
ﬁeld φr,E on the Euclidean space R1+d, which is symbolically expressed as
φr,E(x) = φr(ix0, x) (x = (x0, x) ∈R × Rd), and the ﬁeld equation takes
the form

−∆+
mc
ℏ
2
φr,E(x) = Gr(x),
where Gr is deﬁned via the analytic continuation of Fr. These equations
are of elliptic type. As is well known, elliptic type equations may be more
tractable than hyperbolic ones in some respects. Thus the analytic con-
tinuation to purely imaginary times may make analysis easier equation-
theoretically.
Moreover, the following aspect is also suggestive. For any two points
xE = (ix0, x) and yE = (iy0, y) which have a purely imaginary time compo-
nent respectively, the Minkowski metric of them is −(x0−y0)2−|x−y|2 < 0
and hence, in the symbolical sense, “xE and yE are space-like separated”.
Therefore, applying schematically (heuristically) the microscopic causality
to this case, one has that [φr(xE), φr′(yE)] = 0 (r, r′ = 1, . . . , s). Thus, if a
ﬁeld (φr,E)s
r=1 on the Euclidean space R1+d exists, then it is expected that
they forms a set of commuting operators. Needless to say, commutative
operators may be more tractable than non-commutative ones.
8.10
Euclidean Quantum Fields
As remarked in a heuristic way at the end of the last section, it is expected
that, in the analytic continuation of the G˚arding-Wightman theory to the
non-coincident Euclidean region, a quantum ﬁeld on the Minkowski space-
time may metamorphose into an operator-valued distribution whose values
are mutually commutative. One may call such a commutative operator-
valued distribution a Euclidean quantum ﬁeld if it exists. In this connection,
the vacuum in the G˚arding-Wightman theory should have a corresponding
non-zero vector in the Hilbert space in which the Euclidean quantum ﬁeld
acts. If such a vector exists, we call it a Euclidean vacuum. In this scheme,
it is expected that the Schwinger functions are generated by the expectation
values of the Euclidean quantum ﬁelds with respect to a Euclidean vacuum.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
479
At least it is natural as a working hypothesis to suppose that such a class
of Schwinger functions may exist. These heuristic considerations leads one
to the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 8.4. Let H be a Hilbert space. A Euclidean quantum ﬁeld
(or a Euclidean ﬁeld simply) on R1+d is an operator-valued distribution
ϕE on R1+d with values in L(H ) and common domain D, satisfying the
following (EF.1)–(EF.3):
(EF.1) (cyclicity) There exists a unit vector Φ0 in D such that, for all
n ∈N and fj ∈S (R1+d) (j = 1, . . . , n), Φ0 ∈D(ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn))
and the subspace
D0 := span

Φ0, ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)Φ0|n ∈N, fj ∈S (R1+d),
j = 1, . . . , n
	
is dense in H and D0 ⊂D.
(EF.2) (commutativity) For all f, g ∈S (R1+d), [ϕE(f), ϕE(g)] = 0 on
D0.
(EF.3) (Euclidean invariance) Let n ∈N and fj ∈S (R1+d) (j =
1, . . . , n). Then, for all (a, R) ∈R1+d × SO(1 + d),
D
Φ0, ϕE(f1(a,R)) · · · ϕE(fn(a,R))Φ0
E
= ⟨Φ0, ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)Φ0⟩,
where fj(a,R)(x) := fj(R−1(x −a)), x ∈R1+d.
The vector Φ0 is called a Euclidean vacuum.
Let ϕE be a Euclidean ﬁeld on R1+d as above. Then, by the Schwartz
nuclear theorem, for each n ∈N, there exists a unique tempered distribution
Sn ∈S ′(R1+d) such that
Sn(f1×· · ·×fn) = ⟨Φ0, ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)Φ0⟩,
fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n.
We call Sn’s the Schwinger distributions of the Euclidean ﬁeld ϕE.
Since a Euclidean ﬁeld is commutative in the sense of (EF.2), there
may be the case where H = L2(X, dµ) with a probability measure space
(X, Σ, µ), ϕE(f) (f ∈SR(R1+d)) is a random variable on (X, Σ, µ) and
Φ0 = 1. In this case ϕE is an example of a generalized random process
or a random distribution on R1+d. E. Nelson formulated a set of axioms
for such a Euclidean quantum ﬁeld from which a RQFT on the Minkowski
space-time is reconstructed. The axioms is called the Nelson axioms. For
the details, see [Nelson (1973); Simon (1974)].

Concerning space-time symmetries, we have so far considered only con-
tinuous symmetries, i.e., symmetries deﬁned by continuous groups, such
as time-translation, space-translations, space-rotations and proper Lorentz
transformations. But, besides continuous symmetries, there are physically
important discrete symmetries which are described by ﬁnite groups consist-
ing of transformations on the space-time. In this section we brieﬂy describe
them and give a remark on an important theorem.
We deﬁne mappings I0 and Is on R1+d as follows:
I0(x) := (−x0, x),
(8.62)
Is(x) := (x0, −x),
x = (x0, x) ∈R1+d.
(8.63)
The mappings I0 and Is are respectively called the time-reversal (or time-
inversion) and the space-inversion. Note that
(I0Is)(x) = −x = (IsI0)(x),
x ∈R1+d.
Hence
I0Is = IsI0
and I0Is gives the space-time inversion: R1+d ∋x 7→−x. It is easy to
see that I0 and Is are bijective linear mappings with
I2
0 = I,
I2
s = I.
In particular,
I−1
0
= I0,
I−1
s
= Is.
Hence {I, I0}, {I, Is} and {I, I0, Is, I0Is} become discrete (ﬁnite) groups.
The mappings I0 and Is naturally induce mappings ut and us on
S (R1+d) as follows:
(utf)(x) := f(I0x),
(usf)(x) := f(Isx),
f ∈S (R1+d), x ∈R1+d.
It follows that u# (# = t, s) is bijective and
u2
# = I,
utus = usut,
u−1
# = u#.
The operators ut and us are respectively called the time-reversal oper-
ator and the parity operator on S (R1+d). It is easy to see that the
eigenvalues of u# are ±1. The eigenvalues ±1 of us are called parities.

Let ϕ = (ϕr)N

space F and
ϕ(f) =
N

r=1
ϕr(fr),
f = (fr)N
r=1 ∈⊕NS (R1+d).
We deﬁne
ϕ(#)(f) := ϕ(u#f),
ϕ(st)(f) := ϕ(usutf),
where u#f := (u#fr)N
r=1. The ﬁeld ϕ(t) and ϕ(s) are respectively called
the time-reversal of ϕ and the space-inversion of ϕ. Hence ϕ(st) may
be called the T P-transform of ϕ (T means “time-reversal” and P means
“parity” ).
In terms of operator-valued distribution kernels ϕ(#)

ϕ(t)
r (x) = ϕr(−x0, x),
ϕ(s)

ϕ(st)
r
(x) = ϕr(−x).
In an axiomatic framework of relativistic QFT, one can show that, under
a suitable assumption, there exist an involution C on ⊕NS (R1+d) and an
anti-unitary operator Θ on F such that
Θϕ(f)Θ−1 = ϕ(Cusutf)∗,
f ∈⊕NS (R1+d),
(8.64)
where usutf := (usutfr)N
r=1. This type of transformation law is called PCT
theorem (or CPT theorem), which tells us that the CPT transform
ϕ(Cusutf)∗of ϕ is anti-unitarily implementable.
Remark 8.9. In non-relativistic QFT, PCT theorem may take a slightly
diﬀerent form from (8.64). See Subsection 9.4.3.

Introduction
In an axiomatic QFT in which the basic concept is a quantum ﬁeld (e.g., the
G˚arding-Wightman axioms), no particle picture is given in advance. Hence
one needs to derive a particle picture from the axioms.
Physically one
has a particle picture by observing free elementary particles. In scattering
phenomena of elementary particles, free elementary particles coming from
a long distance at time t ≈−∞are scattered by a target and then ﬂy
away into the distance at t ≈+∞, appearing as free elementary particles

again.26
From these experimental facts, one infers that there exists an
asymptotic ﬁeld φin(t, x) (resp. φout(t, x)) describing free particles which is
formally deﬁned as an asymptotic limit (in a suitable sense) limt→−∞φ(t, x)
(resp. limt→+∞φ(t, x)) of an interacting quantum ﬁeld φ(t, x), satisfying
φin/out(t, x) = eitH/ℏφin/out(0, x)e−itH/ℏ, where H is the Hamiltonian of
the quantum system under consideration, and the free Klein-Gordon
equation

□+ m2
ℏ2

φin/out(t, x) = 0
in the sense of operator-valued distribution if φ(t, x) is a quantum scalar
ﬁeld with m ≥0 being a constant.27 The quantum ﬁelds φin/out are called
free quantum Klein-Gordon ﬁelds and it is shown that they describe free
particles of mass m indeed (the details will be given in Chapter 10). But,
in the case of the asymptotic ﬁelds φin/out, m has to be identiﬁed with the
observed mass of a particle (not the “bare mass”28).
With this particle
picture, one can ask the transition probability of an initial particle state
(in-state) at t = −∞to a ﬁnal particle state (out-state) at t = +∞, which
may be compared with experiments on scattering phenomena of elementary
particles. Such transition probabilities can be described in a uniﬁed way by
a unitary operator called a scattering operator or a scattering matrix.
A scattering theory in the framework of the G˚arding-Wightman axioms
is established and called the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory. Concern-
ing this theory, we refer the reader to textbooks on mathematical QFT (e.g.,
[Araki (1993), Chapter 4], [Bogoliubov et al. (1975), Chapter 4], [Glimm
and Jaﬀe (1987), Chapters 13–14], [Haag (1996), §II.4], [Reed and Simon
(1979), Chapter XI, §16]).
In this section, we present another type of
scattering theory which can be applied to models in non-relativistic QFT
including those in relativistic QFT with cutoﬀs (see Chapter 14). From
mathematical point of view, it gives a method for spectral analysis of a
26In the intermediate space-time where the interaction among the elementary particles
and the target is done, particle picture makes no sense.
27We continue to use the physical unit system where c = 1, unless otherwise stated.
28A “bare mass” means the mass of a particle before being in the interaction with
quantum ﬁelds (it may be somewhat a ﬁctitious notion). In the conventional picture
in physical QFT, the bare mass of a particle may change through an interaction with
a quantum ﬁeld to give an observed mass. It is known, however, that, in some models
in relativistic QFT, observed masses are found to be divergent in formal perturbation
theory. This is a reason why it is diﬃcult to construct a model in relativistic QFT (see
Remark 8.7). In the physical QFT, one avoids such diﬃculties by an prescription called
“renormalization”, but this is not a mathematical solution.

class of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces of Fock space type.
8.12.2
Asymptotic annihilation and creation operators
For simplicity, we consider only a Bose ﬁeld theory in an abstract frame-
work. Let H be a Hilbert space and Fb(H ) be the boson Fock space over
H (see Chapter 5). As a free ﬁeld Hamiltonian, we take
H0 := dΓb(T ),
the boson second quantization of a non-negative and injective self-adjoint
operator T on H (see Subsection 5.3.2). Let H be a self-adjoint operator on
Fb(H ), denoting the total Hamiltonian of a system of an interacting Bose
ﬁeld. Then a symmetric operator H1 on Fb(H ) such that H −H0 ⊂H1
(i.e. D(H)∩D(H0) ⊂D(H1) and HΨ = (H0 +H1)Ψ, Ψ ∈D(H)∩D(H0))
describes an interaction of the quantum system under consideration. We
assume the following:
(H.1) (i) H is bounded from below and (ii) D(H) ⊂D(H0).
Condition (H.1)(i) implies that the lowest energy
E0 := inf σ(H)
of H is ﬁnite and the energy-shifted Hamiltonian
bH := H −E0,
is non-negative. By condition (H.1)(ii) and Lemma 1.8, H0( bH + 1)−1 is
bounded. Hence there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that
∥H0Ψ∥≤C1∥( bH + 1)Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H).
It follows from this fact and an application of Theorem 1.26 that D( bH1/2) ⊂
D(H1/2
0
) and there exists a constant C2 > 0 such that
∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥≤C2∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D( bH1/2),
(8.65)
where we have used the fact that, for all α > 0,
∥Ψ∥≤∥( bH + 1)αΨ∥, Ψ ∈D( bHα).
(8.66)
We denote by A(f) the annihilation operator on Fb(H ) with test vector
f ∈H (see Chapter 5).
Lemma 8.5. For all f ∈D(T −1/2), D( bH1/2) ⊂D(A(f)#) and, for all
Ψ ∈D( bH1/2),
∥A(f)Ψ∥≤C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
(8.67)
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥≤(C2∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥f∥)∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
(8.68)
 

484
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. By Theorem 5.16, D(H1/2
0
) ⊂D(A(f)#) and
∥A(f)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥.
Hence D( bH1/2) ⊂D(A(f)#) and (8.65) yields (8.67). Similarly we have
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥Ψ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥C2∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
where we have used (8.66) with α = 1/2. Hence (8.68) holds.
In the rest of this section, for notatinal simplicity, we use the physical
unit system where ℏ= 1 and c = 1.
For each (f, t) ∈D(T −1/2) × R, we deﬁne
At(f)# := eitHe−itH0A(f)#eitH0e−itH,
where # = ∅, ∗. Recall that D(H1/2
0
) ⊂D(A(f)#) (Theorem 5.16). For any
self-adjoint operator Q on a Hilbert space and all α > 0, e−itQD(|Q|α) =
D(|Q|α), ∀t ∈R. Hence it follows that
D( bH1/2) ⊂D(At(f)#).
By Lemma 5.21, for all f ∈H and t ∈R, operator equality
e−itH0A(f)#eitH0 = A(e−itT f)#
holds. Hence
At(f)# = eitHA(e−itT f)#e−itH.
(8.69)
Lemma 8.6. For all f ∈D(T −1/2), D( bH1/2) ⊂D(At(f)#) and, for all
Ψ ∈D( bH1/2),
∥At(f)Ψ∥≤C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
(8.70)
∥At(f)∗Ψ∥≤(C2∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥f∥)∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
(8.71)
Proof. By Lemma 8.5 and (8.69),
∥At(f)Ψ∥= ∥A(e−itT f)e−itHΨ∥
≤C2∥T −1/2e−itT f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2e−itHΨ∥.
By the functional calculus, we have
∥T −1/2e−itT f∥= ∥T −1/2f∥,
∥( bH + 1)1/2e−itHΨ∥= ∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
Hence (8.70) follows. Similarly one can prove (8.71).
We assume the following condition too:

(H.2) For all Ψ ∈D( bH1/2) and # = ∅, ∗, the strong limits
Ψ#
±(f) :=

t→±∞At(f)#Ψ
exist.
Under assumptions (H.1) and (H.2), for each f ∈D(T −1/2), one can
deﬁne linear operators A±,0(f) and A†
±,0(f) as follows:
D(A±,0(f)) := D( bH1/2),
D(A†
±,0(f)) := D( bH1/2),
A±,0(f)Ψ := Ψ±(f),
A†
±,0(f)Ψ := Ψ∗
±(f),
Ψ ∈D( bH1/2).
It is obvious that A±,0(f) and A†
±,0(f) are densely deﬁned. It is easy to
see that
⟨Φ, A±,0(f)Ψ⟩=
D
A†
±,0(f)Φ, Ψ
E
,
Ψ, Φ ∈D( bH1/2).
Hence D( bH1/2) ⊂D(A±,0(f)∗) and A±,0(f)∗Φ = A†
±,0(f)Φ, Φ ∈D( bH1/2).
In particular, A±,0(f)∗are densely deﬁned. Hence A±,0(f) are closable.
We denote the closures by A±(f):
A±(f) := A±,0(f).
It follows that D( bH1/2) ⊂D(A±(f)) ∩D(A±(f)∗) and
A±(f)∗= A±,0(f)∗⊃A†
±,0(f).
Hence
A±(f)#Ψ =
lim
t→±∞At(f)#Ψ,
Ψ ∈D( bH1/2).
We call A±(f) and A±(f)∗the asymptotic annihilation and cre-
ation operators associated with (H0, H) respectively.
8.12.3
A vanishing theorem
The fact stated in the next lemma tells us an important property of the
annihilation operator A(·).
Lemma 8.7. Suppose that T is absolutely continuous (see Appendix C).
Then, for all f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D(H1/2
0
),
lim
t→±∞A(e−itT f)Ψ = 0.
(8.72)
 

486
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case where Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH (n ≥0,
fj ∈D(T ), j = 1, . . . , n). Then we have
A(e−itT f)Ψ =
n
X
j=1

e−itT f, fj

A(f1)∗· · · \
A(fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
By the absolute continuity (see Theorem C.2 in Appendix C), we have
limt→±∞

e−itT f, fj

= 0.
Hence limt→±∞A(e−itT f)Ψ = 0.
Note
that the subspace algebraically spanned by all vectors of the form Ψ is
D0 := Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). The subspace D0 is a core of H0 and hence of H1/2
0
.
Therefore, for any Ψ ∈D(H1/2
0
) and ε > 0, there exists a vector Φ ∈D0
such that
∥Φ −Ψ∥< ε,
∥H1/2
0
Φ −H1/2
0
Ψ∥< ε.
By using the triangle inequality, we have
∥A(e−itT f)Ψ∥≤∥A(e−itT f)(Ψ −Φ)∥+ ∥A(e−itT f)Φ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2
0
Ψ −H1/2
0
Φ∥+ ∥A(e−itT f)Φ∥
≤ε∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥A(e−itT f)Φ∥.
Since limt→±∞∥A(e−itT f)Φ∥= 0 as just shown above, it follows that
lim sup
t→±∞∥A(e−itT f)Ψ∥≤ε∥T −1/2f∥.
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, we obtain limt→±∞∥A(e−itT f)Ψ∥= 0.
Thus
(8.72) follows.
Theorem 8.9 (vanishing theorem). Suppose that T is absolutely con-
tinuous. Let E be an eigenvalue of H and ΨE ∈ker(H −E). Then, for all
f ∈D(T −1/2),
A±(f)ΨE = 0.
(8.73)
Proof. Since ΨE ∈D(H) ⊂D(H0) ⊂D(H1/2
0
), it follows from Lemma
8.7 that limt→±∞A(e−itT f)ΨE = 0. We have e−itHΨE = e−itEΨE, t ∈R.
Hence
∥A±(f)ΨE∥=
lim
t→±∞∥A(e−itT f)e−itEΨE∥=
lim
t→±∞∥A(e−itT f)ΨE∥= 0.
Thus (8.73) holds.

8.12.4
Commutation relations and representations of CCR
Proposition 8.9. For all t ∈R and f ∈D(T −1/2),
eitHA±(f)#e−itH = A±(eitT f)
on D( bH1/2).
(8.74)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D( bH1/2) and s, t ∈R. Then we have
eitHAs(f)#e−itHΨ = ei(t+s)HA(e−i(t+s)T eitT f)#e−i(t+s)HΨ.
We have
lim
s→±∞eitHAs(f)#e−itHΨ = eitHA±(f)#e−itHΨ
and
lim
s→±∞ei(t+s)HA(e−i(t+s)T eitT f)#e−i(t+s)HΨ = A±(eitT f)#Ψ.
Thus (8.74) is derived.
Proposition 8.9 shows that (eitH, A±(f)) have the same commutation
property as that of (eitH0, A(f)).
Since the strong convergence of vectors implies the norm convergence
of them, Lemma 8.6 immediately yields the following lemma:
Lemma 8.8. For all f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( bH1/2),
∥A±(f)Ψ∥≤C∥T −1/2f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
(8.75)
∥A±(f)∗Ψ∥≤C(∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥f∥)∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
(8.76)
where C > 0 is a constant.
Lemma 8.9. Let Ψ ∈D( bH1/2) and f ∈D(T −1/2)∩D(T n) (n ∈N). Then
the vector-valued functions : R ∋t 7→A±(eitT f)#Ψ are n times strongly
diﬀerentiable in t and the strong derivatives are given by
dn
dtn A±(eitT f)#Ψ = A±((iT )neitT f)#Ψ.
Proof. Since A±(f)# are bH1/2-bounded by Lemma 8.8, one needs only to
replace (S, dΓb(S), A(f)) in the proof of Lemma 5.22 by (T, H, A±(f)).
Theorem 8.10. For each f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ), A±(f)# map D( bH3/2)
to D(H) and, for all t ∈R,
eitHHA±(f) = A±(eitT f)HeitH −A±(T eitT f)eitH,
(8.77)
eitHHA±(f)∗= A±(eitT f)∗HeitH + A±(T eitT f)∗eitH
(8.78)
 

488
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
on D( bH3/2). In particular,
HA±(f) = A±(f)H −A±(T f),
(8.79)
HA±(f)∗= A±(f)∗H + A±(T f)∗
(8.80)
on D( bH3/2).
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D( bH3/2) and Φ ∈D(H). Then, by (8.74),

e−itHΦ, A+(f)Ψ

= R(t),
R(t) :=

A+(eitT f)∗Φ, eitHΨ

.
The left hand side is diﬀerentiable in t with
d
dt

e−itHΦ, A+(f)Ψ

=

e−itH(−iH)Φ, A+(f)Ψ

.
Hence R(t) also is diﬀerentiable in t. Using the preceding lemma, we have
dR(t)
dt
=

A+(iT eitTf)∗Φ, eitHΨ

+

A+(eitT f)∗Φ, eitHiHΨ

.
Hence it follows that

HΦ, eitHA+(f)Ψ

= −

Φ, A+(T eitT f)eitHΨ

+

Φ, A+(eitT f)HeitHΨ

,
where we have used the fact that eitHΨ ∈D(H3/2) ⊂D( bH1/2) and
HeitHΨ ⊂D( bH1/2). Since this holds for all Φ ∈D(H), it follows that
eitHA+(f)Ψ ∈D(H∗) = D(H), which means that A+(f) maps D( bH3/2)
to D(H), and (8.77) holds. Similarly one can prove (8.78). Putting t = 0
in (8.77) and (8.78), we obtain (8.79) and (8.80).
Theorem 8.10 shows that (H, A±(f)) obey the same commutation rela-
tions as those of (H0, A(f)) (see Theorem 5.17).
A consequence of the mapping property of A±(f)# in Theorem 8.10 is
given in the following theorem.
Theorem 8.11 (CCR). Let f, g ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ). Then the following
commutation relations hold on D( bH3/2):
[A±(f), A±(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩,
(8.81)
[A±(f), A±(g)] = 0,
[A±(f)∗, A±(g)∗] = 0.
(8.82)
Proof. Let Φ ∈D( bH1/2) and Ψ ∈D( bH3/2).
Then, by the preceding
theorem, A±(f)#Ψ ∈D(H) ⊂D(A±(g)#). By Theorem 5.18, D(H) ⊂
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
489
D(H0) ⊂D(A(e−itT f)#A(e−itT g)#) for all t ∈R. Hence the following
calculations are mathematically meaningful:
⟨Φ, A±(f)A±(g)∗Ψ⟩=
lim
t→±∞⟨At(f)∗Φ, At(g)∗Ψ⟩

t→±∞

= ⟨f, g⟩⟨Φ, Ψ⟩+ ⟨A±(g)Φ, A±(f)Ψ⟩
= ⟨Φ, (A±(g)∗A±(f) + ⟨f, g⟩)Ψ⟩.
Hence (8.81) follows. Similarly one can prove (8.82).
We set
DT := D(T −1/2) ∩C∞(T ).
Lemma 8.10. For each f ∈DT , A±(f)# leave C∞(H) invariant.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈C∞(H). Then Ψ ∈D( bH3/2). Hence, by Theorem 8.10,
A±(f)Ψ ∈D(H) and
HA±(f)Ψ = A±(f)HΨ −A±(T f)Ψ.
Since HΨ ∈C∞(H) ⊂D( bH3/2), the vector on the right hand side is in
D(H) by Theorem 8.10 again. Hence HA±(f)Ψ ∈D(H) (i.e. A±(f)Ψ ∈
D(H2)) and
H2A±(f)Ψ = HA±(f)HΨ −HA±(T f)Ψ.
Next one applies the same argument to each vector on the right hand side
to conclude that the vector on the right hand side is in D(H).
Hence
H2A±(f)Ψ ∈D(H), i.e., A±(f)Ψ ∈D(H3) and
H3A±(f)Ψ = H2A±(f)HΨ −H2A±(T f)Ψ.
Repeating this argument, one can show that, for all n ∈N, A±(f)Ψ ∈
D(Hn).
Thus A±(f)Ψ
∈
C∞(H).
Similarly one can show that
A±(f)∗C∞(H) ⊂C∞(H).

The following theorem immediately follows from Theorem 8.11 and
Lemma 8.10:
Theorem 8.12. The triplets (Fb(H ), C∞(H), {A±(f)|f ∈DT }) are rep-
resentations of the CCR over DT .29
8.12.5
Scattering operator
We assume the following (H.3) and (H.4) in addition to (H.1) and (H.2):
(H.3) (existence of a ground state) H has a ground state Ψ0:
HΨ0 = E0Ψ0,
∥Ψ0∥= 1.
(H.4) The operator T is absolutely continuous.
Under these assumptions, we have by Theorem 8.9
A±(f)Ψ0 = 0,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
Since Ψ0 ∈C∞(H), it follows from Lemma 8.10 that, for all n ∈N
and fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n), Ψ0 ∈D(A±(f1)# · · · A±(fn)#). Hence we can
deﬁne vectors
Ψ±(f1, . . . , fn) := A±(f1)∗· · · A±(fn)∗Ψ0.
Physically the vector Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn) (resp. Ψ+(f1, . . . , fn)) is interpreted as
an asymptotically observed n particle state at t = −∞(resp. +∞), called
an in-state (resp. out-state). In this way a particle picture emerges in
the interacting system under consideration.
Let
D0,± := span {Ψ0, Ψ±(f1, . . . , fn)|n ∈N, fj ∈DT , j = 1, . . . , n}
and
Fout
in := D0,±.
Then, by Theorem 8.12, (Fout
in , D0,±, {A±(f)|f ∈DT }, Ψ0) are cyclic rep-
resentations of the CCR over DT . Hence, by Theorem 5.42, there exists a
unitary operator U± : Fb(H ) →Fout
in such that U±ΩH = Ψ0 and, for all
f ∈DT , A±(f) = U±A(f)U −1
±
on D0,±. Hence the operator
S := U+U −1
−
29See Section 5.21.
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields

is a unitary operator from Fin onto Fout, satisfying
SΨ0 = Ψ0
(8.83)
and
A+(f) = SA−(f)S−1
(8.84)
on D0,+. We call the operator S the scattering operator or the scatter-
ing matrix.
It follows (8.83) and (8.84) that, for all n ∈N and fj ∈DT (j =
1, . . . , n),
SΨ−(f1, . . . , fn) = Ψ+(f1, . . . , fn).
Proposition 8.10. For all t ∈R, eitHF in
out = F in
out and
e−itHS = Se−itH
(8.85)
on Fin.
Proof. Let n ∈N and fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n). Then, by Proposition 8.9,
e−itHΨ±(f1, . . . , fn) = e−itE0Ψ±(e−itT f1, . . . , e−itT fn),
where we have used the fact that e−itHΨ0 = e−itE0Ψ0. Hence e−itHD0,± ⊂
D0,±. This implies that e−itHD0,± = D0,±. Since D0.± are dense in Fout
in ,
it follows that e−itHFout
in = Fout
in . We have
e−itHSΨ−(f1, . . . , fn) = e−itE0Ψ+(e−itT f1, . . . , e−itT fn)
= Se−itE0Ψ−(e−itT f1, . . . , e−itT fn)
= Se−itHΨ−(f1, . . . , fn).
Hence e−itHS = Se−itH on D0,−. Since e−itHS and Se−itH are bounded
operators on Fin, (8.85) follows.
If Fin = Fout = Fb(H ), then the quantum system is said to be
asymptotically complete.
In this case S is a unitary operator on
Fb(H ).
If F∞:= Fin = Fout, then the quantum system is said to have weak
asymptotic completeness. In this case S is a unitary operator on F∞.
Since, for each in-state Ψ ∈F∞with ∥Ψ∥= 1, SΨ is a state vector at
t = +∞(an out-state) determined causally under no measurements in the
meantime, | ⟨Φ, SΨ⟩|2 is interpreted as the transition probability from Ψ at
t = −∞to a state Φ ∈F∞with ∥Φ∥= 1 at t = +∞(i.e. the probability
 

492
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
that the state Φ is found under a measurement at t = +∞). In particular,
| ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 gives the probability that the system is found to be in the same
state Ψ as the intitial one under a measurement at t = +∞. Based on this,
one says that there is no scattering with respect to the asymptotic intitial
state Ψ at t = −∞if | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 = 1. We say that there is no scattering
if, for all unit vectors Ψ ∈F∞, | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 = 1. Hence, if | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 < 1
for some unit vector Ψ ∈F∞, then there is a scattering. “No scattering”
is characterized as follows:
Proposition 8.11. There is no scattering if and only if S = eiθ for some
θ ∈R.
Proof. The “if part” is obvious. So we prove the “only if part”. Sup-
pose that there is no scattering.
Then, for all unit vectors Ψ ∈F∞,
| ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 = 1. Let Ψ ∈F∞with ∥Ψ∥= 1 and P be the orthogonal
projection onto the one-dimensional space HΨ := {αΨ|α ∈C}. Then we
have SΨ = ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩Ψ + (1 −P)SΨ. Hence
∥SΨ∥2 = | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 + ∥(1 −P)SΨ∥2 = 1 + ∥(1 −P))SΨ∥2.
Since S is unitary, ∥SΨ∥2 = ∥Ψ∥2 = 1. Hence ∥(1 −P)SΨ∥2 = 0. This
implies that SΨ ∈HΨ. Hence SΨ = α(Ψ)Ψ with a constant α(Ψ) such that
|α(Ψ)| = 1. It follows that, for all non-zero vectors Φ ∈F∞, SΦ = β(Φ)Φ
with β := α(Φ/∥Φ∥). Using the linearity of S, one can show that β(Φ) is
independen of Φ. Hence there exists a constant θ ∈R such that β(Φ) = eiθ.
Thus S = eiθ.
8.12.6
Spectrum of H
We continue to assume (H.1)–(H.4). Then we have the orthogonal decom-
position
Fb(H ) = Fin/out ⊕F ⊥
in/out.
Since e−itHFin/out = Fin/out for all t ∈R, it follows that H is reduced
by Fin/out and hence by F ⊥
in/out too. We denote the reduced part of H to
Fin/out and F ⊥
in/out by Hin/out and H⊥
in/out respectively.
Lemma 8.11. The following operator equalities hold:
U −1
−(Hin −E0)U−= H0,
(8.86)
U −1
+ (Hout −E0)U+ = H0.
(8.87)
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
493
Proof. Let fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N) and t ∈R. Then
U −1
−eit(Hin−E0)Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn) = U −1
−Ψ−(eitT f1, . . . , eitT fn)
= A(eitT f1)∗· · · A(eitT fn)∗ΩH
= eitH0A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= eitH0U −1
−Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn).
Since D0,−is dense in Fin and U −1
−eit(Hin−E0) and eitH0U −1
−
are bounded,
it follows that U −1
−eit(Hin−E0) = eitH0U −1
−, i.e.,
U −1
−eit(Hin−E0)U−= eitH0.
By the unitary covariance of functional calculus, the left hand side is equal
to exp(itU −1
−(Hin −E0)U−). Hence (8.86) follows. Similarly one can prove
(8.87).
For a subset X of R and a constant c ∈R, we deﬁne a subset X +c ⊂R
by
X + c := {x + c|x ∈X}.
Theorem 8.13. Assume (H.1)–(H.4). Then
(i) σ(Hin/out) = σ(H0) + E0.
(ii) σ(H0) + E0 ⊂σ(H).
(iii) If Fin = Fb(H ) or Fout = Fb(H ), then σ(H) = σ(H0) + E0 and
the ground state of H is unique.
Proof. (i) By the preceding lemma and the unitary invariance of spectrum,
we have σ(Hin/out −E0) = σ(H0). Hence the desired result follows.
(ii) Since H is a direct sum operator, we have
σ(H) = σ(Hin/out) ∪σ(H⊥
in/out).
Hence σ(H) ⊃σ(Hin/out) = σ(H0) + E0.
(iii) Let Fin = Fb(H ). Then F ⊥
in = {0} and hence Hin = H. Thus,
by (ii), σ(H) = σ(H0) + E0. Suppose that a vector Φ0 ̸= Ψ0 were a ground
state of H. Without loss of generality, we can assume that Ψ0 ⊥Φ0. Then,
by A−(f)Φ0 = 0 for all f ∈D(T −1/2), we have ⟨Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn), Φ0⟩= 0
for all fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N). Hence Φ0 ∈D⊥
0,−= {0}.Thus Φ0 = 0.
But this is a contradiction, Thus the ground state of H is unique. Similarly
one can prove the stated fact in the case Fout = Fb(H ) too.
Remark 8.10. Theorem 8.13(iii) shows that, if σ(H0) + E0 ⫋σ(H), then
Fin/out ̸= Fb(H ). Physically an eigenvector of H with an eigenvalue in
σ(H) \ (σ(H0) + E0) is interpreted as a bound state of H.

Let us consider a typical case of T appearing in quantum scalar ﬁeld
models.
Corollary 8.3. Let H be separable and assume (H.1)–(H.4). Supppose
that T is absolutely continuous and
σ(T ) = σac(T ) = [m, ∞)
(8.88)
with a constant m ≥0. Then:
(i)
σ(Hin/out) = {E0} ∪[E0 + m, ∞),
σp(Hin/out) = {E0}.
(8.89)
(ii) {E0} ∪[E0 + m, ∞) ⊂σ(H).
(iii) If m = 0, then σ(H) = [E0, ∞).
(iv) If Fin = Fb(H ) or Fout = Fb(H ), then σ(H) = {E0}∪[E0+m, ∞)
and the ground state of H is unique.
Proof. (i) By Theorem 5.3 and (8.88), we have σp(H0) = {0} and
σ(H0) = {0} ∪[m, ∞).
By these facts and Theorem 8.13(i), we obtain (8.89).
Part (ii) follows from (i) and Theorem 8.13(ii).
(iii) Let m = 0. Then, by (ii), [E0, ∞) ⊂σ(H). But it is obvious that
σ(H) ⊂[E0, ∞).
Part (iv) follows from (i) and Theorem 8.13(iii).
Remark 8.11. The Hamiltonian H may have eigenvalues E other than E0
(E > E0). Let ΨE be a unit eigenvector of H with eigenvalue E. Then one
can construct the subspaces
span {ΨE, A±(f1)∗· · · A±(fn)∗ΨE|n ∈N, fj ∈DT , j = 1, . . . , n}
and the same considerations as above can be applied to these subspaces.

Existence of asymptotic creation and annihilation
operators
In concluding this section, we give a suﬃcient condition for (H.2) to hold.
We assume (H.1). Then we have
H = H0 + H1.
Concerning the perturbation operator H1, we assume the following (H.1)’:
 

General Theory of Quantum Fields
495
(H.1)’ There exist a number p ≥3/2 and a core D of T −1/2 such that, (i)
for all t ∈R, e−itT D ⊂D; (ii) for all f ∈D, D( bHp) ⊂D(H1A(f)#)∩
D(A(f)#)H1) and
∥[H1, A(f)#]Ψ∥≤u#(f)∥( bH + 1)pΨ∥,
Ψ ∈D( bHp),
where u#(f) is a non-negative constant depending on f such that
the mapping : R ∋t 7→u#(e−itT f) is Borel measurable and
R
R u#(e−itT f)dt < ∞.
Under assumptions (H.1) and (H.1)’, we have for all Ψ ∈D( bHp) and
s ∈R
∥eisH[H1, A(e−isT f)#]e−isHΨ∥≤u#(e−isT f)∥( bH + 1)pΨ∥.
(8.90)
Hence, for all t ∈R ∪{±∞}, the Bochner (strong) integrals
I(t)#Ψ :=
Z t
0
eisH[H1, A(e−isT f)#]e−isHΨds
exist (see Appendix E).
Lemma 8.12. Assume (H.1) and (H.1)’. Then, for all Ψ ∈D( bHp), t ∈R
and f ∈D,
At(f)#Ψ = A(f)#Ψ + iI(t)#Ψ.
(8.91)
Proof. Let Φ ∈D(H) and Ψ ∈D( bHp). Then we have
⟨Φ, At(f)Ψ⟩=

e−itHΦ, Ψ(t)

,
where Ψ(t) := A(e−itT f)e−itHΨ. We ﬁrst show that Ψ(t) is strongly diﬀer-
entiable in t (this is non-trivial because of the unboundedness of A(e−itT f)).
For any ε ∈R \ {0}, we have
1
ε(Ψ(t + ε) −Ψ(t)) = A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( bH + 1)−1/2Ψε + A(e−itT fε)e−itHΨ,
where
Ψε := ( bH + 1)1/2e−itH e−iεH −1

fε := (e−iεT −1)f

By the functional calculus, we have limε→0 Ψε = ( bH + 1)1/2e−itH(−iH)Ψ.
By (8.67), A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( bH + 1)−1/2 is a bounded operator with
∥A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( bH + 1)−1/2∥≤C2∥T −1/2f∥
 

496

uniformly in ε. Moreover,
∥A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( bH + 1)−1/2 −A(e−itT f)( bH + 1)−1/2∥
≤C2∥(e−iεT −1)T −1/2f∥

(ε →0).
Hence
lim
ε→0 A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( bH + 1)−1/2Ψε = A(e−itT f)e−itH(−iH)Ψ.
We have limε→0 fε = −iT f. Hence, in the same way as above, we obtain
lim
ε→0 A(e−itT fε)e−itHΨ = A(e−itT (−iT )f)e−itHΨ.
Thus Ψ(t) is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
Ψ′(t) := d
dtΨ(t) = A(e−itT f)e−itH(−iH)Ψ + A(e−itT (−iT )f)e−itHΨ.
Since e−itHΦ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t with the strong derivative
(e−itHΦ)′ = −iHe−itHΦ, it follows that ⟨Φ, At(f)Ψ⟩is diﬀerentiable in t
with

Thus (8.91) with At(f)# = At(f) follows. Similarly one can prove (8.91)
with At(f)# = At(f)∗.
Lemma 8.13. Assume (H.1) and (H.1)’. Then, for all Ψ ∈D( bHp) and
f ∈D, Ψ#
±(f) := limt→±∞At(f)#Ψ exist and are given by
Ψ#
±(f) = A(f)#Ψ + iI(±∞)Ψ.

which tend to 0 as t1, t2 →±∞. Hence Ψ#

Theorem 8.14. Assume (H.1) and (H.1)’. Then, for all f ∈D(T −1/2)
and Ψ ∈D( bH1/2), Ψ#
±(f) := limt→±∞At(f)#Ψ exist.
Proof. Step 1. We ﬁrst extend the result of Lemma 8.13 to the case where
f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( bHp). Since D is a core of T −1/2, there exists a
sequence {fn}n in D such that fn →f and T −1/2fn →T −1/2f as n →∞.
Let t1, t2 ∈R. Then, by the triangle inequality,
∥At1(f)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥
≤∥At1(f)Ψ −At1(fn)Ψ∥+ ∥At1(fn)Ψ −At2(fn)Ψ∥
+ ∥At2(fn)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥
≤2C2∥T −1/2(f −fn)∥∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥At1(fn)Ψ −At2(fn)Ψ∥,
where we have used Lemma 8.6. By Lemma 8.13, we have
lim sup
t1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥≤2C2∥T −1/2(f −fn)∥∥( bH + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
Then, taking the limit n →∞, we obtain limt1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −
At2(f)Ψ∥= 0.
Hence limt→±∞At(f)Ψ exist.
Similarly one cam show
the existence of the strong limits limt→±∞At(f)∗Ψ.
Step 2. We next extend the result in Step 1 to the case where f ∈
D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( bH1/2).
Since D( bHp) with p ≥3/2 is a core of
bH1/2, there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D( bHp) such that Ψn →Ψ and
bH1/2Ψn →bH1/2Ψ as n →∞.
Let t1, t2 ∈R.
Then, by the triangle
inequality,
∥At1(f)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥
≤∥At1(f)(Ψ −Ψn)∥+ ∥At1(f)Ψn −At2(f)Ψn∥
+ ∥At2(f)(Ψn −Ψ)∥
≤2C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2(Ψ −Ψn)∥+ ∥At1(f)Ψn −At2(f)Ψn∥,
where we have used Lemma 8.6. By Step 1, we have
lim sup
t1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥≤2C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( bH + 1)1/2(Ψ −Ψn)∥.
Then, taking the limit n →∞, we obtain limt1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −
At2(f)Ψ∥= 0.
Hence limt→±∞At(f)Ψ exist.
Similarly one can show
that limt→±∞At(f)∗Ψ exist.
Remark 8.12. In the case where Ψ ∈D( bH1/2)\D( bHp) or f ∈D(T −1/2)\
D, (8.92) does not necessarily hold, i.e., the term iI(±∞)Ψ may be replaced
by an abstract one which is not explicitly written as a Bochner integral.
A simple model which satisﬁes (H.1) and (H.1)’ will be discussed in
Chapter 13.

Remark. A meaning of this problem in the context of quantum mechanics
is as follows. Let G be a group and H be a Hilbert space. A mapping U
from a group G to B(H ) is called a projective representation of G if,
for each g ∈G, U(g) is unitary or anti-unitary and, for all g1, g2 ∈G,
U(g1)U(g2) = ω(g1, g2)U(g1g2)

with ω(g1, g2) ∈C satisfying |ω(g1, g2)| = 1.
In quantum mechanics or
QFT, the symmetry deﬁned by G is expressed most generally as a projective
representation of G on a Hilbert space of state vectors. This is a consequence
of Wigner’s theorem (for details, see, e.g., [Bogoliubov et al. (1975), §2.3]).
The conclusion of this problem is that, if the Hamiltonian H obeys the

the d-dimensional generalized Laplacian and m > 0 is a constant.

Remark. The anti-unitary operator TR is called the time-reversal
operator on L2(T × Rd).
 

Chapter 9
Non-relativistic QFT
Mathematically rigorous construction of basic models in non-relativistic QFT is
given.
9.1
Introduction
From this chapter, we start on showing existence of models of QFT by con-
structing them in a mathematically rigorous way. We ﬁrst discuss models
in non-relativistic QFT, since they are easier to treat than those in rel-
ativistic QFT. A non-relativistic QFT also has two categories: a bosonic
one and a fermionic one (see Section 5.1). We ﬁrst construct a model of
non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld and then a model of non-relativistic Fermi ﬁeld.
But, for the reader’s convenience, we begin with a brief description of a
corresponding classical ﬁeld theory.
9.2
Classical Field Theory
According to de Broglie (1923), associated with a non-relativistic free parti-
cle (e.g., a non-relativistic electron) in the d-dimensional space Rd = {x =
(x1, . . . , xd)|xj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d} (d ∈N; physically d = 3) is a matter-
wave u : R × Rd →C; R × Rd ∋(t, x) 7→u(t, x) ∈C obeying the partial
diﬀerential equation
i∂u(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
∆u(t, x),
(9.1)
where mf > 0 is a constant and ∆is the d-dimensional generalized Lapla-
cian.1 The function u is called the classical free de Broglie ﬁeld. We
1For a function f satisfying a classical partial diﬀerential equation, we always assume
the necessary diﬀerentiability for f unless otherwise stated. For example, in the case of
505

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
call (9.1) the free de Broglie equation.
One may note that (9.1) is same in the form as a Schr¨odinger equation in
quantum mechanics. But the physical meaning of the de Broglie equation
is totally diﬀerent from that of the Schr¨odinger equation as an equation
in quantum mechanics, because the former is an equation of motion for a
classical ﬁeld describing a matter-wave, while the latter is an equation for
the probability amplitude of a quantum state.2 For this reason we do not
use the name “Schr¨odinger equation” for (9.1) in the context of matter-
wave theory.3 Of course, from a purely mathematical point of view, it does
not matter how (9.1) is called.
A classical de Broglie ﬁeld may have a self-interaction (a nonlinear in-
teraction) and an interaction with an external ﬁeld V : R1+d →R. An
equation in which such interactions are incorporated is given by
i∂u(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
∆u(t, x) + V (t, x)u(t, x)
+ U(|u(t, x)|)u(t, x),
(9.2)
where U : [0, ∞) →R is a given function. It is obvious that the case where
V = 0 and U = 0 in (9.2) reduces to (9.1).
The time-reversal utr of de Broglie ﬁeld u is deﬁned by
utr(t, x) := u(−t, x)∗.
It is easy to see that
i∂utr(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
∆utr(t, x) + V (−t, x)utr(t, x)
+ U(|utr(t, x)|)utr(t, x).
(9.3)
Hence, if V (t, x) = V (−t, x) (in particular, V is independent of t), then
utr obeys (9.2). This property is called the time-reversal symmetry of
equation (9.2).
In the case where U(r) = λr2, r ∈[0, ∞) with λ ∈R being a constant,
(9.2) takes the following form:
i∂u(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
∆u(t, x) + V (t, x)u(t, x)
+ λ|u(t, x)|2u(t, x).
(9.4)
(9.1), it is assumed that u is C1-class in t and C2-class in x.
2This becomes more transparent if one considers an N-body quantum system with
N ≥2 where the probability amplitude of a quantum state is given by an element in
L2((Rd)N) (hence the conﬁguration space is (Rd)N, not Rd as the position space) or the
possibility that a de Broglie ﬁeld may have self-interactions (see the next paragraph).
3More detailed pedagogical explanations on the conceptual diﬀerence between the the-
ory of matter-wave and quantum mechanics are found in [Tomonaga (1952)] with a full
development of the both theories.
 

Non-relativistic QFT
507
This equation is called the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.4
As easily seen, for each k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd, the function uk on R1+d
deﬁned by
uk(t, x) := Ake−itω(k)+ik·x
with Ak ∈C, ω(k) := k2/2mf and k ·x := Pd
j=1 kjxj is a solution to (9.1).
Let m > 0 be the mass of the associated non-relativistic free particle
and p = (p1, . . . , pd) ∈Rd be the momentum of the particle with the matter
wave uk. Then the energy E(p) of the particle is given by
E(p) = p2
2m.
(9.5)
On the other hand, one has the de Broglie-Einstein-Planck relation:
p = ℏk,
E(p) = ℏω(k) = ℏk2
2mf
,
which implies that E(p) = p2/2ℏmf. Comparing this with (9.5), one has
mf = m
ℏ.
(9.6)
This gives a relation between the constant mf in the classical de Broglie
ﬁeld theory and the mass m of the particle which is expected to be the
quanta of a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld.
9.3
Heuristic Arguments Towards Construction of QFT
By substituting (9.6) for (9.2), one obtains an equation which a quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld should obey. Hence a quantum ﬁeld ψ corresponding to
the classical free de Broglie ﬁeld u if it exists should be an operator-valued
distribution on R1+d acting in a suitable Hilbert space F and satisfying
the ﬁeld equation
iℏD0ψ(x) = −ℏ2
2m∆ψ(x)
(9.7)
in the sense of operator-valued distribution (x0 = t), i.e.,
ψ(−iℏD0f) = −ℏ2
2mψ(∆f),
f ∈S (R1+d),
(9.8)
on a dense subspace in F.
4Physically this equation is supposed to describe approximately a classical matter ﬁeld
of a phase in the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). For details, see, e.g., [Kevrekidis
et al. (2008)].
 

508
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Remark 9.1. In the case of a classical self-interacting de Broglie ﬁeld u
obeying (9.2), a diﬃculty immediately arises in considering a quantum ﬁeld
ψ as an operator-valued distribution corresponding to it, because products
of ψ(x)# such as ψ(x)∗ψ(x)ψ(x) is mathematically meaningless unless ψ(x)
is an operator-valued function with a suitable property (but, in the conven-
tional scheme of ﬁeld quantization, ψ(x) is not an operator-valued function
even in the free ﬁeld case). This applies to other models in QFT too. In
fact, the ill-deﬁnedness of products of a quantum ﬁeld at each space-time
point is an origin of the so-called “divergence problems” in QFT and makes
it diﬃcult to construct an interacting quantum ﬁeld model with space-time
symmetries.
If one follows the canonical quantization formalism5, then ψ should be
constructed from a sharp-time quantum ﬁeld ψ(t, ·) and, for any ﬁxed time
t ∈R, ψ(t, ·) should satisfy canonical commutation relations (a bosonic
case) or canonical anti-commutations relations (a fermionic case)6:
[ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)∗] = δ(x −y),
[ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)] = 0, [ψ(t, x)∗, ψ(t, y)∗] = 0
or
{ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)∗} = δ(x −y),
{ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)} = 0, {ψ(t, x)∗, ψ(t, y)∗} = 0
in the sense of operator-valued distribution, where δ(x −y) is the Dirac
delta-distribution on Rd × Rd.
In what follows, we construct such an operator-valued distribution and
investigate properties of it.
A heuristic idea for the construction is as
follows. The operator
h0 := −ℏ2
2m∆
(9.9)
5For a classical ﬁeld φ(t, x) which has a Lagrangian, the momentum conjugate π(t, x)
to φ(t, x) is deﬁned from the Lagrangian density L (φ, ˙φ, ∇φ) ( ˙φ(t, x) := ∂φ(t, x)/∂t)
by π(t, x) := ∂L (φ, ˙φ, ∇φ)/∂˙φ(t, x). The canonical quantization scheme is to replace φ
and π by operator-valued distributions φq and πq satisfying [φq(t, x), πq(t, y)] = iℏδ(x−
y) [φq(t, x), φq(t, y)] =, [πq(t, x), πq(t, y)] = 0 (the case where φq is a Bose ﬁeld) or
{φq(t, x), πq(t, y)} = iℏδ(x −y) {φq(t, x), φq(t, y)} = 0, {πq(t, x), πq(t, y)} = 0 (the
case where φq is a Fermi ﬁeld). See, e.g., [Bjorken and Drell (1965), Chapter 11].
6In the present case, it is shown that the momentum conjugate to u(t, x) is equal to
iℏu(t, x)∗. See, e.g., [Arai (2000b), Chapter 8].
 

Non-relativistic QFT

f ∈D(h0),
where d/dt denotes the strong diﬀerentiation in t. Hence (9.7) is heuristi-
cally solved as
ψ(t, x) = (e−ith0/ℏψ0)(x)
(x0 = t),
where ψ0 is an operator-valued distribution on Rd. This suggests that the
sharp-time quantum ﬁeld to be constructed is of the form
ψ(t, f) = ψ0(e−ith0/ℏf),
f ∈S (Rd), t ∈R.
(9.10)
Hence a possible approach is as follows: (i) construct an operator-valued
distribution ψ0 satisfying
[ψ0(x), ψ0(y)∗] = δ(x −y),
(9.11)
[ψ0(x), ψ0(y)] = 0, [ψ0(x)∗, ψ0(y)∗] = 0
(9.12)
or
{ψ0(x), ψ0(y)∗} = δ(x −y),
(9.13)
{ψ0(x), ψ0(y)} = 0, {ψ0(x)∗, ψ0(y)∗} = 0
(9.14)
in the sense of operator-valued distribution; (ii) deﬁne ψ(t, f) by (9.10);
(iii) investigate properties of ψ(t, f).
9.4
A Bosonic Quantum de Broglie Field
Relations (9.11) and (9.12) suggests that a way to construct a bosonic
quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical de Broglie ﬁeld may be to take
ψ0 to be the annihilation operator acting in the boson Fock space
Fb(L2(Rd)) =

over L2(Rd). Hence let ψ(·) be the annihilation operator on Fb(L2(Rd)),
so that, for all f ∈L2(Rd) and Ψ ∈D(ψ(f))∗), (ψ(f)∗Ψ)(0) = 0,
(ψ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = √nSn(f ⊗Ψ(n−1))
and
[ψ(f), ψ(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩,
(9.15)
[ψ(f), ψ(g)] = 0,
[ψ(f)∗, ψ(g)∗] = 0,
f, g ∈L2(Rd),

on Fb,0(L2(Rd)).
As mentioned in Remark 9.1, it is diﬃcult to construct a self-interacting
quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with full space-time symmetries. Hence we restrict
ourselves to constructing a free quantum de Broglie ﬁeld and a quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld interacting with an external ﬁeld only. We ﬁrst discuss the
former.
9.4.1
A free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
We denote by Fd the Fourier transform from L2(Rd
x) to L2(Rd
k):
(Fdf)(k) :=
1
(2π)d/2
Z
Rd e−ik·xf(x)dx, f ∈L2(Rd), a.e.k ∈Rd
k,
(9.17)
in the L2-sense. It is well known that Fd is unitary and
FdS (Rd
x) = S (Rd
k).
(9.18)
We introduce the following symbol:
ˆf := Fdf.
Since Fd preserves the inner product of L2(Rd), one has
Z
Rd
ˆf(k)∗ˆg(k)dk =
Z
Rd f(x)∗g(x)dx,
f, g ∈L2(Rd).
(9.19)
This fact is called the Plancherel theorem.
Recall that h0 is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L2(Rd). The
following lemma describes basic properties of h0:
Lemma 9.1.
(i) For all f ∈L2(Rd),
(Fde−ith0/ℏf)(k) = e−itℏk2/2m ˆf(k),
a.e.k ∈Rd.
(ii) For all f ∈L1(Rd) ∩L2(Rd) and t ∈R \ {0},

Z
Rd eim|x−y|2/2tℏf(y)dy.
(iii) For all t ∈R e−ith0/ℏleaves S (Rd) invariant.
Proof. (i) It is well known that
Fd(−∆)F −1
d
= k2,
 

Non-relativistic QFT
511
where the right hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the func-
tion k2. By this fact and the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we
obtain
Fde−ith0/ℏF −1
d
= e−itℏk2/2m,
where the right hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the func-
tion e−itℏk2/2m. Thus the desired result follows.
(ii) By (i) and the inverse Fourier transform, we have
(e−ith0/ℏf)(x) =
1
(2π)d/2
Z
Rd eik·xe−itℏk2/2m ˆf(k)dk.
Then one needs only to calculate the integral on the right hand side (limiting
arguments are needed). But we omit the details (see, e.g., [Arai (1997a),
Theorem 6.11]).
(iii) It is easy to see that the function : k 7→e−itℏk2/2m ˆf(k) is in S (Rd
k).
By this fact and (9.18), e−ith0/ℏf ∈S (Rd).
Recall that ψ(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd))) is anti-linear in f ∈L2(Rd). By
Lemma 9.1(i) or (ii),
(e−ith0/ℏf)∗= eith0/ℏf ∗,
t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd).
Taking these facts into account, we deﬁne an operator ψ(t, f) by
ψ(t, f) := ψ(eith0/ℏf ∗),
f ∈L2(Rd).
Lemma 9.2. The mapping : S (Rd) ∋f 7→ψ(t, f) ∈L(Fb(L2(Rd))) is an
operator-valued distribution with D(N 1/2
b
) being a common domain, where
Nb is the boson number operator on Fb(L2(Rd)).
Proof. It is obvious that, for all f ∈L2(Rd), ψ(t, f) is densely deﬁned
and D(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(ψ(t, f)) ∩D(ψ(t, f)∗). For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), ψ(t, f)Ψ is
linear in f. Moreover
∥ψ(t, f)Ψ∥≤∥e−ith0/ℏf ∗∥∥N 1/2
b
Ψ∥= ∥f∥∥N 1/2
b
Ψ∥.
Hence, in the same manner as in Example 8.5, one can show that, for all
Φ, Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), the mapping:S (Rd) ∋f 7→⟨Φ, ψ(t, f)Ψ⟩is a tempered
distribution on Rd.
Let
HdB := dΓb(h0),
(9.20)
the boson second quantization of h0 (see Chapter 5).
Theorem 9.1. The quadruple (Fb(L2(Rd)), D(N 1/2
b
), HdB, {ψ(t, ·)}t∈R)
is a sharp-time QFT.7
7See Deﬁnition 8.3.
 

512
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We need only to show that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
),
eitHdB/ℏψ(0, f)e−itHdB/ℏΨ = ψ(t, f)Ψ,
f ∈S (Rd), t ∈R.
But this follows from a simple application of Lemma 5.21.
Since Nb and HdB are strongly commuting (Proposition 5.4), it follows
that, for all t ∈R,
eitHdB/ℏN 1/2
b
⊂N 1/2
b
eitHdB/ℏ.
Hence
eitHdB/ℏD(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(N 1/2
b
).
The Hamiltonian HdB is unique up to constant addition:
Proposition 9.1. Let H be a self-adjoint operator such that, for all Ψ ∈
D(N 1/2
b
) and t ∈R,
eitH/ℏψ(0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ = ψ(t, f)Ψ,
(9.21)
eitH/ℏD(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(N 1/2
b
).
(9.22)
Then there exists a constant E such that H = HdB + E.
Proof. Properties (9.21) and (9.22) imply that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
) and
t ∈R,
eitH/ℏψ(0, f)∗e−itH/ℏΨ = ψ(t, f)∗Ψ.
Let
A = {ψ(0, f) ↾D(N 1/2
b
), ψ(0, f)∗↾D(N 1/2
b
)|f ∈S (Rd)}.
Then A = {ψ(f) ↾D(N 1/2
b
), ψ(f)∗↾D(N 1/2
b
)|f ∈S (Rd)}. For any T ∈
A′, T ψ(f)Ψ = ψ(f)T Ψ · · · (∗) for all f ∈S (Rd) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Since
D(N 1/2
b
) is a core for ψ(f), it follows from a limiting argument that (∗)
extends to all Ψ ∈D(ψ(f)).
The same applies to ψ(f)∗.
Hence T ∈
{ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈S (Rd)}′ = CI (Theorem 5.14).
Therefore A′ = CI.
Thus, by Proposition 8.2, H = HdB + E for a real constant E.
Using commutation relations for ψ(f)#’s (see Theorem 5.13) and the
unitarity of eith0/ℏ, one can show that the following commutation relations
at any ﬁxed time t ∈R hold: for all f, g ∈L2(Rd),
[ψ(t, f), ψ(t, g)∗] = ⟨g, f⟩,
[ψ(t, f), ψ(t, g)] = 0,
[ψ(t, f)∗, ψ(t, g)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(L2(Rd)).

Theorem 9.2 (ﬁeld equation).
Let f ∈D(∆) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Then
the Fb(L2(Rd))-valued function:R ∋t 7→ψ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable
and
iℏd
dtψ(t, f)Ψ = −ℏ2
2mψ(t, ∆f)Ψ.
(9.23)
Proof. We have ψ(t, f)Ψ = ψ(eith0/ℏf ∗)Ψ. Hence, applying Lemma 5.22
with S = I, T = h0 and n = 1, we see that ψ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable
in t and
d
dtψ(t, f)Ψ = −i
ℏψ(e−ith0/ℏh0f ∗)Ψ = iℏ
2mψ(t, ∆f)Ψ.
Hence (9.23) holds.
Based
on
the
above
properties,
we
call
the
sharp-time
QFT
(Fb(L2(Rd)), D(N 1/2
b
) HdB, {ψ(t, ·)}t∈R) a free bosonic quantum de
Broglie ﬁeld theory; ψ(t, ·) and HdB are respectively called the free
bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld at time t and the Hamitonian of
the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld.
9.4.2
Energy-momentum operator
We next show that the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld theory is
space-translation covariant.
For each a ∈Rd, we deﬁne an operator u(a) on L2(Rd) by
(u(a)f)(x) := f(x −a),
f ∈L2(Rd), a.e.x ∈Rd.
(9.24)
Then, by Theorem 1.32, we have
u(a) = e−ia·ˆp/ℏ,
a ∈Rd,
(9.25)
where
ˆp := (ˆp1, . . . , ˆpd)
with ˆpj deﬁned by (1.47) physically denotes the d-dimensional momentum
operator in the sense of non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
Let
Ub(a) := Γb(u(a)),
a ∈Rd.
Then, by Corollary 5.2, {Ub(a)}a∈Rd is a strongly continuous unitary rep-
resentation of Rd.

Since
h0 =
1
2m
d
X
j=1
(ˆpj)2,
h0 strongly commutes with each ˆpj. Hence, by Theorem 5.30,
Ub(a)ψ(t, f)Ub(a)−1 = ψ(e−ia·ˆp/ℏeith0/ℏf ∗)
= ψ(eith0/ℏe−ia·ˆp/ℏf ∗).
It is easy to see that
e−ia·ˆp/ℏf ∗= (e−ia·ˆp/ℏf)∗= (u(a)f)∗.
Hence
Ub(a)ψ(t, f)Ub(a)−1 = ψ(t, u(a)f).
Thus ψ(t, f) is space-translation covariant.
On the other hand, a simple application of Theorem 5.7(i) with T =
−a · ˆp yields
Γb(u(a)) = e−ia·P b/ℏ,
where
P b := (P 1
b , . . . , P d
b ),
P j
b := dΓb(ˆpj), j = 1, . . . , d.
(9.26)
Hence
Ub(a) = e−ia·P b/ℏ.
Thus P b is the momentum operator of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie
ﬁeld.
It follows from the strong commutativity of h0 and ˆpj (j = 1, . . . , d) and
Proposition 5.4 that the energy-momentum operator
PdB := (HdB, Pb,1, . . . , Pb,d)
(Pb,j := −P j
b)
of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld is strongly commuting.
Therefore one can ask what the joint spectrum σJ(PdB) is like.
Before
giving an answer to the question, however, we discuss discrete symmetries
of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld.

9.4.3
CT symmetry and parity symmetry
Let uc be the complex conjugation on L2(Rd):
ucf := f ∗,
f ∈L2(Rd).
(9.27)
Then uc is anti-unitary and
u2
c = I.
It follows from Remark 5.2 that
Uc := Γb(uc)
is an anti-unitary operator on Fb(L2(Rd)) and
U 2
c = I.
Hence
Uc = U −1
c
.
(9.28)
The time-reversal
quantum
de
Broglie
ﬁeld is deﬁned by
ψ(−t, ucf)∗.
The next theorem shows that it is anti-unitarily imple-
mentable by Uc.
Theorem 9.3. For all t ∈R and f ∈L2(Rd),
ψ(−t, ucf)# = Ucψ(t, f)#U −1
c
.
Proof. Theorem 5.30 holds also in the case where Uc is anti-unitary. Hence
Ucψ(t, f)U −1
c
= ψ(uceith/ℏf ∗) = ψ(e−ith/ℏf) = ψ(−t, f ∗).
Theorem 9.4. For all t ∈R and aj ∈R (j = 1, . . . , d),
UceitHdB/ℏU −1
c
= e−itHdB/ℏ,
(9.29)
UceiajPb,j/ℏU −1
c
= eiajPb,j/ℏ, j = 1, . . . , d.
(9.30)
Proof. We have
UceitHdB/ℏU −1
c
= Γb(uceith0/ℏuc).
It is easy to see that uceith0/ℏuc = e−ith0/ℏ. Hence (9.29) holds. Similarly
one can prove (9.30) (use that uce−iaj ˆpj/ℏuc = e−iaj ˆpj/ℏ).
We next discuss parity symmetry. The mapping Is : Rd →Rd deﬁned
by
Isx := −x,
x ∈Rd
is called the space-inversion on Rd. This induces a unitary operator us
on L2(Rd):
(usf)(x) := f(Isx) = f(−x),
a.e.x ∈Rd.
(9.31)
Theorem 9.5. For all f ∈L2(Rd) and t ∈R,
Γb(us)ψ(t, f)Γb(us)−1 = ψ(t, usf).
(9.32)
 

516
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. It is easy to see that
Fd(usf)(k) = ˆf(−k),
a.e.k ∈R3.
Using this formula, we have
useith0/ℏf = eith0/ℏusf.
Thus (9.32) follows.
Theorem 9.5 shows that the space-inversion ψ(t, usf) of the free quan-
tum de Broglie ﬁeld is unitarily implementable by Γb(us).
9.4.4
Energy-momentum spectrum
We ﬁrst investigate the spectra of the Hamiltonian HdB and the momentum
operator P b separately.
Let Fd : L2(Rd
x) →L2(Rd
k) be the Fourier transform (see (9.17)).
Then Γb(Fd) is a unitary operator from Fb(L2(Rd)) = Fb(L2(Rd
x)) onto
Fb(L2(Rd
k)). By Theorem 5.8, for any self-adjoint operator T on L2(Rd
x),
Γb(Fd)dΓb(T )Γb(Fd)−1 = dΓb(FdT F −1
d ).
(9.33)
Recall that
Fdh0F −1
d
= ENR,
FdˆpjF −1
d
= pj (j = 1, . . . , d),
(9.34)
where ENR and pj are functions on Rd
k deﬁned as follows:
ENR(k) := ℏ2k2
2m ,
pj(k) := ℏkj,
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd
k.
(9.35)
Physically ENR(k) means the kinetic energy of a non-relativistic free par-
ticle of mass m with momentum ℏk. It follows from the spectral property
of a multiplication operator that
σ(h0) = σ(ENR) = [0, ∞),
σp(h0) = σp(ENR) = ∅,
(9.36)
σ(ˆpj) = σ(pj) = R,
σp(ˆpj) = σp(pj) = ∅,
(9.37)
where pj := −pj (j = 1, . . . , d).
By (9.33) and (9.34), we obtain the following operator equations:
Γb(Fd)HdBΓb(Fd)−1 = ˆHdB,
Γb(Fd)Pb,jΓb(Fd)−1 = ˆPb,j (j = 1, . . . , d),
where
ˆHdB := dΓb(ENR),
(9.38)
ˆPb,j := dΓb(pj).
(9.39)
 

Non-relativistic QFT
517
It follows from the unitary invariance of the spectra of a linear operator
that
σ( ˆHdB) = σ(HdB),
σp( ˆHdB) = σp(HdB),
(9.40)
σ( ˆPb,j) = σ(Pb,j),
σp( ˆPb,j) = σp(Pb,j).
(9.41)
Theorem 9.6.
(i)
σ(HdB) = [0, ∞),
σp(HdB) = {0},
where the Fock vacuum ΩL2(Rd) ∈Fb(L2(Rd
x)) is the unique ground
state of HdB:
HdBΩL2(Rdx) = 0.
(ii) For all j = 1, . . . , d,
σ(Pb,j) = R,
σp(Pb,j) = {0},
where
ker Pb,j = {αΩL2(Rdx)|α ∈C}.
Proof. (i) By (9.38), Theorem 5.3 and (9.36), we have
σ( ˆHdB) = [0, ∞),
σp( ˆHdB) = {0}
with ker ˆHdB = {αΩL2(Rd
k)|α ∈C}. By these facts and (9.40), we obtain
the desired result.
(ii) Similar to the proof of (i).
We next investigate the joint spectrum σJ(PdB) of the energy-
momentum operator PdB (see Subsection 1.8.2). The result is as follows.
Theorem 9.7.
σJ(PdB) = [0, ∞) × Rd.
(9.42)
To prove this theorem, we need some preliminaries.
Lemma 9.3. Let N ≥2 (N ∈N) and T := (T1, . . . , TN) be an N-tuple
of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H . We
denote by ET the joint spectral measure of T . Let U be a unitary operator
from H to a Hilbert space K . Then T U := (UT1U −1, . . . , UTNU −1) is an
N-tuple of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on K and
UET (B)U −1 = ET U (B),
B ∈BN.
(9.43)
In particular,
σJ(T ) = σJ(T U).
(9.44)
 

518
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. For a self-adjoint operator S on a Hilbert space, we denote by ES
the spectral measure of S. For all K ∈B1
UETj(K)U −1 = EUTjU−1(K),
j = 1, . . . , N.
Hence it follows that T U is strongly commuting and
UET (K1×· · ·×KN)U −1 = ET U (K1×· · ·×KN),
Kj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , N.
For each Ψ ∈K , there are two bounded measures µ1 and µ2 on (RN, BN)
deﬁned by
µ1(B) :=

Ψ, UET (B)U −1Ψ

,
µ2(B) := ⟨Ψ, ET U (B)Ψ⟩,
B ∈BN.
The above equation means that
µ1(K1 × · · · × KN) = µ2(K1 × · · · × KN),
Kj ∈B1.
Hence, by the uniqueness of E. Hopf’s extension theorem, µ1 = µ2. By this
result and the polarization identity, we obtain (9.43).
Equation (9.43) implies that
supp UET (·)U −1 = supp ET U = σJ(T U).
On the other hand, it is easy to see that
supp UET (·)U −1 = supp ET = σJ(T ).
Thus (9.44) holds.
Let EdB be the joint spectral measure of PdB and
ˆEdB(B) := Γ(Fd)EdB(B)Γ(Fd)−1,
B ∈B1+d.
Then, by Lemma 9.3, ˆEB is the joint spectral measure of
ˆPdB := ( ˆHdB, ˆPb,1, . . . , ˆPb,d),
and
σJ(PdB) = σJ( ˆPdB).
(9.45)
Hence we investigate σJ( ˆPdB).
We have
ˆHdB = ⊕∞
n=0Hn,
where ˆH0 := 0 and ˆHn with n ≥1 is the multiplication operator on
⊗n
s L2(Rd
k) = L2
sym((Rd
k)n) (the natural identiﬁcation) by the function En
on (Rd
k)n given by
En(k1, . . . , kn) :=
n
X
l=1
ENR(kl),
kl ∈Rd
k, l = 1, . . . , n.
 

Non-relativistic QFT
519
Since Hn is a multiplication operator, the spectral measure EHn of Hn
takes the form
EHn(J) = χE−1
n (J),
J ∈B1,
where the right hand side is the multiplication operator by the characteristic
function χE−1
n (J) of the set E−1
n (J) := {k ∈Rd
k|En(k) ∈J}. Hence, by
Theorem 4.4, the spectral measure E ˆ
HdB of ˆHdB is given by
E ˆ
HdB(J) = δ0(J) ⊕(⊕∞
n=1χE−1
n (J)),
J ∈B1,
(9.46)
where δ0(J) := 1 if 0 ∈J and δ0(J) := 0 if 0 ̸∈J.
We also have
ˆPb,j = 0 ⊕(⊕∞
n=1P (n)
j
),
where P (n)
j
is the multiplication operator by the function
p(n)
j
:=
n
X
l=1
pj.
Hence the spectral measure of P (n)
j
takes the form
EP (n)
j
(J) = χp(n)
j
−1(J),
J ∈B1.
Therefore, by Theorem 4.4 again,
E ˆ
Pb,j(J) = δ0(J) ⊕(⊕∞
n=1χp(n)
j
−1(J)),
J ∈B1.
(9.47)
For each n ∈N, the (1 + d)-tuple
ˆP (n)
dB := (Hn, −P (n)
1
, . . . , −P (n)
d
)
of self-adjoint operators on L2
sym((Rd
k)n) is strongly commuting.
For each n ≥1, we deﬁne a mapping Fn : (Rd
k)n →R1+d by
Fn := (En, −p(n)
1 , . . . , −p(n)
d ).
It follows that
Fn(k1, . . . , kn) =

l=1
ENR(kl),
n

l=1

, (k1, . . . , kn) ∈(Rd

It is easy to see that Fn is continuous.
We denote by ˆE(n)
dB (n ∈N) the joint spectral measure of ˆP (n)
dB . We set
ˆE(0)
dB(B) := δ0(B),
B ∈B1+d.
Lemma 9.4. For all n ∈N, ˆE(n)
dB = χF −1
n
(·).
 

520
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. For all Borel sets Jµ ∈B1 (µ = 0, 1, . . ., d), we have by the above
mentioned facts
ˆE(n)

By the uniqueness of the joint spectral measure, we conclude that ˆE(n)
dB =
χF −1
n
(·).
Let
Pn := Fn((Rd
k)n),
(9.48)
the range of the function Fn.
Lemma 9.5. The set Pn is closed.
Proof. Let pN ∈Pn and pN →p ∈R1+d (N →∞). Then, for some
k(N)
l
∈Rd (l = 1, . . . , n),
pN = Fn(k(N)

.
Since supN≥1 |pN| < ∞, it follows that, for all l = 1, . . . , n, supN≥1 |k(N)
l
| <
∞.
Hence, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a con-
vergent subsequence {(k(Nα)
1
, . . . , k(Nα)
n
)}α of {(k(N)
1
, . . . , k(N)
n
)}N.
Let
kl := limα→∞k(Nα)
l
(l = 1, . . . , n).
Then, by the continuity of Fn,
limα→∞pNα = Fn(k1, . . . , kn). Hence p = Fn(k1, . . . , kn) ∈Pn. Thus
Pn is closed.
Lemma 9.6. For all n ∈N, supp ˆE(n)
dB = Pn.
Proof. By Lemma 9.4, we have
supp ˆE(n)
dB = supp χF −1
n
(·) = Pn.
Since Pn is closed by the preceding lemma, the desired result follows.
Lemma 9.7.
σJ(PdB) = {0} ∪(∪∞

where, in the last step, we have used Lemma 9.6. By this result and (9.45),
we obtain the desired result.
It remains to make explicit the set on the right hand side of (9.49). It
is obvious that
P1 =

(p0, p)
p0 = p2
2m, p ∈Rd

.
Hence P1 is a parabolic quadratic hypersurface.
For Pn with n ≥2, one ﬁnds the following fact:
Lemma 9.8. For all n ≥2,
Pn =

(p0, p)
p0 ≥

Proof. By the triangle inequality, we have for all p, pl ∈Rd (l = 1, . . . , n−

(9.50)
If pl = p/n, l = 1, . . . , n −1, then the equality holds in (9.50).

Now let (p0, p) ∈Pn. Then, for some kl ∈Rd, l = 1, . . . , n,
p0 = ENR(k1, . . . , kn),
p =

X
l=1
ℏkl.
Hence, putting pl = ℏkl, l = 1, . . . , n −1, we have

Conversely, let (p0, p) ∈Qn. Then p0 ≥p2/2mn. The function f on

(pl ∈Rd, l = 1, . . . , n −1)
is continuous. By (9.50), f((Rd)n−1) ⊂[p2/2mn, ∞). Hence there exists an
element (p1, . . . , pn−1) ∈(Rd)n−1 such that p0 = f(p1, . . . , pn−1). Hence,
putting kl = pl/ℏ, l = 1, . . . , n −1 and kn = (p −Pn−1
l=1 )pl/ℏ, we see that
p0 = ENR(k1, . . . , kn). Hence (p0, p) ∈Pn. Thus Qn ⊂Pn.
Now we are ready to prove Theorem 9.7. It follows from Lemma 9.8
that
∪∞
n=1Pn = [0, ∞) × Rd.
By this fact and Lemma 9.7, we obtain (9.42).
9.4.5
Galilean symmetry
In this subsection we discuss symmetry properties of the free bosonic quan-
tum de Broglie ﬁeld. For this purpose, we ﬁrst introduce a transformation
group which acts on a non-relativistic space-time.
We denote by O(d) the group of d × d orthogonal matrices:
O(d) := {R ∈Md(R)|tRR = I}
and introduce the direct product of O(d), Rd and R1+d:
G1+d := O(d) × Rd × R1+d
= {(R, v, a)|R ∈O(d), v ∈Rd, a ∈R1+d}.
 

Non-relativistic QFT
523
Each (R, v, a) ∈G1+d deﬁnes a mapping on R1+d by
(R, v, a)(x) := (t + a0, Rx + vt + a),
x = (t, x) ∈R1+d,
where a = (a0, a) ∈R × Rd. The mapping (R, v, a) is called a Galilei
transformation on R1+d. Note that the motion:R ∋t 7→Rx + vt is the
uniform motion with velocity v and the initial position being Rx.
It is obvious that
(Id, 0, 0) = I
(identity),
where Id is the d×d unit matrix. It is easy to see that each (R, v, a) ∈G1+d
is a bijection with
(R, v, a)−1 = (R−1, −R−1v, (−a0, −R−1(a −a0v))) ∈G1+d.
(9.51)
Moreover, for all (R, v, a), (T, u, b) ∈G1+d,
(T, u, b)(R, v, a) = (T R, Tv + u, (b0 + a0, T a + b + a0u)) ∈G1+d.
Hence G1+d is a transformation group on R1+d. The transformation group
G1+d is called the (1 + d)-dimensional Galilei group. For g ∈G1+d and
x ∈R1+d, we sometimes write g(x) = gx.
The subset
G hom
1+d := {(R, v, 0)|R ∈O(d), v ∈Rd}
of G1+d forms a subgroup of G1+d. The subgroup G hom
1+d is called the (1+d)-
dimensional homogeneous Galilei group.
A function u : R1+d →C is said to be Galilei invariant (resp.
homogeneously Galilei invariant) if, for all g ∈G1+d (resp. G hom
1+d ),
u(gx) = u(x), x = (t, x) ∈R1+d.
For each u : R1+d →C, g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d and a constant C ∈R, one
can deﬁne u(g,C) : R1+d →C by
u(g,C)(t, x) := e−iCθ(t,x,v)u(g(t, x)),
(t, x) ∈R1+d,
where
θ(t, x, v) := v · Rx + 1
2v2t.
The function u(g,C) is called the Galilei transformation of u associated
with (g, C).
We denote by SV,dB the space of solutions to the nonlinear de Broglie
equation (9.2):
SV,dB := {u : R1+d →C|u satisﬁes (9.2)}.
 

524
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The following theorem tells us how the space SV,dB is transformed under
Galilei transformations.
Theorem 9.8. Let u ∈SV,dB and
ug := u(g,mf).
(9.52)
Then ug satisﬁes the following partial diﬀerential equation:
i∂ug(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
∆ug(t, x) + V (g(t, x))ug(t, x)
+ U(|ug(t, x)|)ug(t, x),
(9.53)
Proof. We set x = (t, x), ∂t := ∂/∂t and
∇:=
 ∂
∂x1 , . . . ,
∂
∂xd

.
Let g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d. Then
ug(x) = e−imfθ(x,v)u(gx).
Hence, by direct computations, we have the following results:
∂tug(x) = −i
2mfv2ug(x)
+ e−imfθ(x,v)[(∂tu)(gx) + v · (∇u)(gx)],
∇ug(x) = −imftRvug(x) + e−imfθ(x,v) tR(∇u)(gx),
∆ug(x) = −m2
f v2ug(x) −2imfe−imfθ(x,v)v · (∇u)(gx)
+ e−imfθ(x,v)(∆u)(gx),
where we have used the fact tR = R−1 ∈O(d). Hence

Using (9.2) and |ug(x)| = |u(gx)|, one sees that the right hand side is equal
to V (gx)ug(x) + U(|ug(x)|)ug(x). Hence (9.53) holds.
Remark 9.2. Note that, if the term e−imfθ(x,v) is absent in the deﬁnition
of ug, then (9.53) does not hold.
Corollary 9.1. Assume that V is Galilei invariant.
Then, for all u ∈
SV,dB and g ∈G1+d, ug ∈SV,dB.
 

Non-relativistic QFT

This corollary shows that, for all g ∈G1+d, the solution space SV,dB
with V being Galilei invariant is invariant under the Galilei transformation
of a classical ﬁeld u: u 7→ug. We call this property the Galilean symme-
try of the non-linear de Broglie equation (9.2). In particular this symmetry
holds in the case V = 0.
We next consider Galilean symmetry of the free bosonic quantum de
Broglie ﬁeld. To ﬁnd the form of a Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld, we recall that, for any φ ∈D(h0), the function
φ(t) := e−ith0/ℏφ
(t ∈R)
satisﬁes the strong diﬀerential equation
iℏdφ(t)
dt
= h0φ(t)
in L2(Rd), where dφ(t)/dt is the strong derivative of φ(t) with respect to t.
Deﬁne ˜φ : R1+d →C by
˜φ(t, x) := φ(t)(x) = (e−ith0/ℏφ)(x),
a.e.x ∈Rd.
Then, for each g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d,
˜φg(t, x) = ˜φ(g,mf)(t, x) = e−imfθ(t,x,v)(e−i(t+a0)h0/ℏφ)(Rx + vt + a)
= e−imθ(t,x,v)/ℏ(ei(a+vt)·ˆp/ℏe−i(t+a0)h0/ℏφ)(Rx),
where (9.6) is used. By Corollary 9.1, ˜φg satisﬁes the free de Broglie equa-
tion under suitable conditions for φ.
Now let ψ(f) (f ∈L2(Rd)) be the annihilation operator on Fb(L2(Rd))
as before.
By replacing φ(x) in the above equation with the operator-
valued distribution kernel ψ(x) of ψ(f ∗) and formally smearing the resulting
equation by a function f ∈L2(Rd), we arrive at the following deﬁnition for
the Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with
g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d:
ψg(t, f) := ψ(Kv,a(t)f ∗
R),
(9.54)
where
Kv,a(t) := ei(t+a0)h0/ℏe−i(a+vt)·ˆp/ℏeimθt,v/ℏ
with θt,v being the multiplication operator by the function
θt,v(x) := v · x + 1
2v2t,
, x ∈Rd
and
fR(x) := f(R−1x),
x ∈Rd.

To rewrite Kv,a(t), we note that
Kv,a(t) =eimθt,v/ℏ

×

e−imθt,v/ℏe−i(a+vt)·ˆp/ℏeimθt,v/ℏ
.
It is easy to see that
e−imθt,v/ℏˆpjeimθt,v = ˆpj + mvj,
j = 1, . . . , d.
Hence, by the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we obtain
Kv,a(t) = eimθt,v/ℏei(t+a0)h0(v)/ℏe−i(a+vt)·(ˆp+mv)/ℏ
(9.55)
with
h0(v) :=
1
2m(ˆp + mv)2.
Lemma 9.9. Let f ∈D(h0). Then Kv,a(t)f is strongly diﬀerentiable in
t ∈R and
dKv,a(t)f
dt
= i
ℏKv,a(t)h0f.
Proof. It follows from the strong commutativity of ˆp that h0 strongly
commutes with (a + vt) · (ˆp + mv) and D(h0) ⊂D((a + vt) · (ˆp + mv)).
Hence, using (9.55), we see that Kv,a(t)f is strongly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R
and
dKv,a(t)f

Thus we obtain the desired result.
We are now ready to derive an equation of motion for ψg(t, f):
Theorem 9.9. Let g ∈G1+d, f ∈D(∆) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Then ψg(t, f)Ψ
is strongly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R and
iℏd
dtψg(t, f)Ψ = −ℏ2
2mψg(t, ∆f)Ψ.
(9.56)
Proof. It is easy to see that f ∗
R ∈D(h0). Hence it follows from Lemma
9.9 that ψg(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
d

It is easy to see that ∆f ∗

R. Hence (9.56) holds.
 

Non-relativistic QFT
527
Thus we see that the Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum de
Broglie ﬁeld ψg(t, f) obeys the free bosonic quantum de Broglie equation.
For each R ∈O(d), we deﬁne η(R) : L2(Rd) →L2(Rd) by
(η(R)f) := fR,
f ∈L2(Rd).
It is easy to see that η(R) is a unitary representation of O(d) on L2(Rd)
(cf. Problem 3). Hence, for each g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d, the operator
ρt(g) := Kv,a(t)η(R)
is a unitary operator on L2(Rd). By (9.54), we have
ψg(t, f) = ψ(ρt(g)f ∗).
Therefore, putting
Ut(g) := Γb(ρt(g))
and applying Theorem 5.30, we obtain
Ut(g)ψ(f ∗)Ut(g)−1 = ψg(t, f).
(9.57)
This gives a unitarily covariant relation between the time-zero ﬁeld ψ(f ∗)
and the Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld ψg(t, f)
at time t. It follows from (9.57) that
ψg(t, f) = Vt(g)ψ(t, f)Vt(g)−1,
t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd),
(9.58)
where
Vt(g) := Ut(g)e−itHdB/ℏ.
Since Vt(g) is unitary, (9.58) means that ψg(t, f) is unitarily equivalent to
ψ(t, f).
In concluding this subsection, we derive a relation between ψg(0, f) and
ψg(t, f).
For each v ∈Rd, we deﬁne
hv := h0 −v · ˆp + m
2 v2
acting in L2(Rd).
Lemma 9.10. For all v ∈Rd, hv is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.
Proof. It is well known or easy to see that each ˆpj is inﬁnitesimally small
with resepect to h0.
Hence, by Corollary 1.1(i), hv is self-adjoint and
bounded from below. It is to see that
hv =
1
2m(ˆp −mv)2.
Hence hv is non-negative.

Theorem 9.10. Let g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d and f ∈L2(Rd). Then
ψg(t, f) = eitdΓb(hv)/ℏψg(0, f)e−itdΓb(hv)/ℏ,
t ∈R,
(9.59)
where dΓb(hv) is the boson second quantization of hv.
Proof. By (9.57), we have
ψg(0, f) = U0(g)ψ(f ∗)U0(g)−1.
Hence
ψg(t, f) = Ut(g)U0(g)−1ψg(0, f)U0(g)Ut(g)−1
= Γb(αt(g))ψg(0, f)Γb(αt(g))−1,
where αt(g) := ρt(g)ρ0(g)−1. By direct comupations, one sees that αt(g) =
eithv/ℏ. Thus (9.59) follows.
9.4.6
Interaction with an external ﬁeld
In this section we consider a bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld interacting
with an external ﬁeld. An external scalar ﬁeld is a real-valued Borel mea-
surable function V on Rd such that V (x) is ﬁnite for a.e. x ∈Rd. Then
the one-boson Hamiltonian is given by the Schr¨odinger operator
hV := −ℏ2
2m∆+ V
acting in L2(Rd). We assume that hV is essentially self-adjoint.8 Then the
self-adjoint operator hV (the closure of hV ) generates the strongly contin-
uous one-parameter unitary group {eithV /ℏ}t∈R. So as a natural extension
of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld, we deﬁne an operator ψV (t, f)
(t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd)) by
ψV (t, f) := ψ(eithV /ℏf ∗).
In the same way as in Lemma 9.2, one can prove the following lemma:
Lemma 9.11. For each t ∈R, the mapping: S (Rd) ∋f 7→ψV (t, f) ∈
L(Fb(L2(Rd)) is an operator-valued distribution with D(N 1/2
b
) being a com-
mon domain.
8For classes of V satisfying this assumption, see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1975), Chapter
X].
 

Non-relativistic QFT
529
The boson second quantization operator
HdB(V ) := dΓb(hV )
(9.60)
of hV is self-adjoint. In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 9.1, one
can show that, for all t ∈R and f ∈L2(Rd),
eitHdB(V )/ℏψV (0, f)e−itHdB(V )/ℏ= ψV (t, f)
on D(N 1/2
b
).
Thus (Fb(L2(Rd)), D(N 1/2
b
), HdB(V ), {ψV (t, ·)}t∈R) is a
sharp-time QFT.
It follows from the general properties of a boson second quantization
operator that 0 is an eigenvalue of HdB(V ) with the Fock vacuum ΩL2(Rd)
being an eigenvector of it:
HdB(V )ΩL2(Rd) = 0.
(9.61)
But we note that ΩL2(Rd) is not necessarily a ground state of HdB(V ),
because HdB(V ) is not necessarily non-negative:
Proposition 9.2.
(i) If hV ≥0, then HdB(V ) ≥0 and the Fock vacuum ΩL2(Rd) is a ground
state of HdB(V ) with the ground state energy being zero.
(ii) If σ(hV ) ∩(−∞, 0) ̸= ∅, then HdB(V ) is not bounded from below.
Proof. The non-negativity of HdB(V ) in (i) and the unboundedness from
below of HdB(V ) in (ii) follow from an application of Theorem 5.2. The
statement on the ground state of HdB(V ) in (i) follows from (9.61).
The ﬁeld equation of ψV (t, f) is formulated in the following theorem:
Theorem 9.11. For all f ∈D(hV ) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), ψV (t, f)Ψ is
strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
iℏd
dtψV (t, f)Ψ = −ℏ2
2mψV (t, ∆f)Ψ + ψV (t, V f)Ψ.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 9.2.
Remark 9.3. Consider the case where V is continuous except at a ﬁnite
number of points in Rd and not a constant function. Then ˆpj does not
strongly commute with V .9 Hence hV and ˆpj do not strongly commute.
Physically this means that, in the one-boson system under consideration,
the momentum ˆpj (j = 1, 2, . . . , d) is not a conserved quantity. An ap-
plication of Proposition 5.4 yields that each Pb,j does not strongly com-
mute with HdB(V ). Hence, in this quantum system, the joint spectrum of
(HdB(V ), Pb,1, . . . , Pb,d) makes no sense.
9Use (9.24) and (9.25) with a = (0, . . . , 0,
jth

The Operator-valued Distribution Kernel of the Boson
Annihilation Operator
In this section we show that the operator-valued distribution kernel of the
boson annihilation operator ψ(f ∗) (f ∈S (Rd)) on Fb(L2(Rd)) has mean-
ing as an operator-valued function and discuss related topics.
We denote by C((Rd)n) the set of continuous functions on (Rd)n and
introduce a subspace:
DC := {Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd))|Ψ(n) ∈C((Rd)n), n ≥1},
which is dense in Fb(L2(Rd)). For each x ∈Rd, we deﬁne a linear operator
ψ(x) on Fb(L2(Rd)) as follows:
D(ψ(x)) := DC,
(9.62)
(ψ(x)Ψ)(n)(x1, . . . , xn) :=
√
n + 1Ψ(n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn),
Ψ ∈D(ψ(x)), n ≥0,
(9.63)
We call ψ(x) the boson annihilation operator at the point x.
We remark that the domain of ψ(x) is independent of x and, in the
deﬁnition of D(ψ(x)), the condition of continuity of each component Ψ(n)
of Ψ ∈D(ψ(x)) is necessary, because the right hand side of (9.63) has to
be uniquely determined as an equivalence class for each x.10
It is easy to see that ψ(x) is densely deﬁned and leaves DC invariant.
But, as the next proposition shows, the operator ψ(x) is somewhat singular:
Proposition 9.3. For all x ∈Rd, D(ψ(x)∗) = {0}. In particular, ψ(x) is
not closable.
Proof. Let Φ ∈D(ψ(x)∗) and Θ := ψ(x)∗Φ. Then, for all Ψ ∈D(ψ(x)),
⟨Φ, ψ(x)Ψ⟩= ⟨Θ, Ψ⟩. Let Ψ be of the following form:Ψ(k) = 0, k ̸= n + 1
(n ≥0). Then
(Φ(0))∗Ψ(1)(x) =

and deﬁne a function gs : Rd →R (s > 0) by
gs(x′) := sd/2u(s(x′ −x))1/2,
x′ ∈Rd.
Then gs ∈L2(Rd) and ∥gs∥= 1. Moreover, for any f ∈C∞

change of variable y = s(x′ −x),
⟨f, gs⟩= s−d/2

Hence, letting M := supx′∈Rd |f(x′)|, we have

Z
Rd u(y)1/2dy →0
(s →∞).
Therefore lims→∞⟨f, gs⟩= 0. Since C∞
0 (Rd) is dense in L2(Rd), it follows
from Proposition A.1 in Appendix A that w- lims→∞gs = 0. Using this
fact and Proposition A.1 again, we can prove that, for any Ξ ∈⊗n
s L2(Rd)
and hj ∈L2(Rd) (j = 1, . . . , n −1),
lim
s→∞⟨Ξ, Sn(gs ⊗h1 ⊗· · · ⊗hn−1)⟩= 0.
(9.66)
Taking gs as Ψ(1) in (9.64), we have lims→∞(Φ(0))∗gs(x) = 0.
But
gs(x) = sd/2. Hence Φ(0) = 0.
We next show that Φ(n) = 0 for all n ≥1. Taking Sn+1(f1 ⊗· · ·⊗fn+1)
with fj ∈S (Rd) (j = 1, . . . , n + 1) as Ψ(n+1) in (9.65), we have

This is a contradiction.
Hence

nL2(Rd)) is dense in
⊗n
s L2(Rd), it follows that Φ(n) = 0. Hence Φ = 0. Thus D(ψ(x)∗) = {0}.
In particular, D(ψ(x)∗) is not dense in Fb(L2(Rd)). Hence ψ(x) is not
closable.
Remark 9.4. It is easy to see that the formal manipulation on ψ(x)∗gives

tically the reason why D(ψ(x)∗) = {0} and suggests that ψ(x)∗may be
reinterpreted as an operator from DC to the dual space D′
C in a suitable
topology. Indeed, this idea has been extensively developed in white noise
analysis [Obata (1994)].
Proposition 9.4. For all Ψ ∈DC, ∥ψ(·)Ψ∥2 is integrable with respect to
the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure and
Z
Rd ∥ψ(x)Ψ∥2dx = ∥N 1/2

∥ψ(x)Ψ∥2 =

(Rd)n |Ψ(n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn)|2dx1 · · · dxn,

obtain (9.70).
Formula (9.69) can be extended to a more general class of second quan-
tization operators. Let h be a Borel measurable function on Rd such that,
for a.e.x ∈Rd, |h(x)| is ﬁnite. Then the multiplication operator by h on
L2(Rd) is densely deﬁned and closed. Hence the boson second quantization
operator dΓb(h) of h is deﬁned. We introduce a subspace of DC:

Sesquilinear Forms Deﬁned by ψ(x) and ψ(x)∗
Formula (9.71) suggests that ψ(x) may be used to deﬁne sesquilinear
forms (see Section 2.1) which, in special cases, deﬁne linear operators on
Fb(L2(Rd)). In this section we brieﬂy discuss this aspect.
We introduce a subspace of DC:
DS := {Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd))|Ψ(n) ∈S (Rdn), n ≥1}.
It is easy to see that DS is dense in Fb(L2(Rd)). We ﬁrst note the following
fact:
Lemma 9.12. For each x ∈Rd, ψ(x) leaves DS invariant: ψ(x)DS ⊂
DS .
Proof. Let Ψ ∈DS . Then we have (9.63). It is easy to see that, for each
x ∈Rd, the function Ψ(n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn) of (x1, . . . , xn) is an element in
S (Rdn). Hence (ψ(x)Ψ)(n) ∈S (Rdn). Thus ψ(x)Ψ ∈DS .
Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS and m, n ∈Z+ with m + n ≥1. Then, by Lemma 9.12,
one can deﬁne a function KΨ,Φ on Rdm × Rdn by
KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) := ⟨ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ, ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ⟩
(9.72)
for all (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) ∈Rdm × Rdn.
Lemma 9.13. For all Ψ, Φ ∈DS , KΨ,Φ ∈S (Rdm × Rdn).
Proof. Let p ≥0. Then, by repeated use of (9.63), we have
(ψ(x1) . . . ψ(xm)Ψ)(p)(x′

p)
=
p
(p + 1) . . . (p + m)Ψ(p+m)(xm, . . . , x1, x′

p).
(9.73)
Hence
KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . xm, y1, . . . , yn)
=

S (Rdm × Rdn) as a function of (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn). Here we only give
an idea to do it by showing that, for all f ∈S (R2), the function g deﬁned
by
g(x) :=
Z
R
f(x, y)dy,
x ∈R
is an elemen in S (R).
Since the partial derivative ∂xf of f in x is in S (R2), it follows that,
for all N ≥1, there exists a constant aN > 0 such that
|∂xf(x, y)| ≤
aN
(1 + x2 + y2)N ≤
aN
(1 + y2)N .
The function: R ∋y 7→aN(1 + y2)−N is an integrable function on R
independent of x.
Hence, by a general theorem concerning the inter-
changability between diﬀerentiation and integral, g is diﬀerentiable with
dg(x)/dx =
R
R ∂xf(x, y)dy.
One can continue this process of argument
successively to conclude that g is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable with
g(n)(x) := dng(x)
dxn
=
Z
R
∂n
xf(x, y)dy, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
Hence, for all m ∈N,
|x|m|g(n)(x)| ≤
Z
R
|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)|dy.
Since xm∂n
xf is an element in S (R2), lim|x|→∞|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)| = 0. For
any N ≥1, there exists a constant bN > 0 such that
|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)| ≤
bN
(1 + x2 + y2)N ≤
bN
(1 + y2)N .
Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
Z
R
|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)|dy →0 (|x| →∞).
Therefore |x|m|g(n)(x)| →0 (|x| →∞).
Thus g
∈S (R).
This
method can be easily extended to the case where g is replaced by
R
Rdp f(x1, . . . , xℓ, x′
1, . . . , x′
p)dx′
1 · · · dx′
p with f ∈S (Rdℓ×Rdp) with ℓ, p ∈
N.
Let F be a tempered distribution on Rd(m+n), i.e., F ∈S ′(Rd(m+n)).
Then, by Lemma 9.13, one can deﬁne a mapping LF : DS × DS →C by
LF (Ψ, Φ) := F(KΨ,Φ),
(Ψ, Φ) ∈DS × DS .
As is easily seen, LF is a sesquilinear form on DS .
 

Non-relativistic QFT
537
Note that, if F is a polynomially bounded function (see Subsection
D.3.2) or an element of Lp(Rd(m+n)) (p ≥1),
LF (Ψ, Φ) =
Z
Rd(m+n) dx1 · · · dxmdy1 · · · dynF(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
× ⟨ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ, ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ⟩.
(9.74)
From this point of view, the sesquilinear form LF is sometimes written
symbolically as
LF =
Z
Rd(m+n) F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)ψ(xm)∗. . . ψ(x1)∗
×ψ(y1) . . . ψ(yn)dx1 . . . dxmdy1 . . . dyn
or
LF =
Z
Rd(m+n) ψ(xm)∗. . . ψ(x1)∗F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
×ψ(y1) . . . ψ(yn)dx1 . . . dxmdy1 . . . dyn,
where F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) is the distribution kernel of F. But the
reader should keep in mind that these are just convenient symbolical ex-
pressions for LF and have no mathematical meaning as integrals at this
stage.
Remark 9.5. Since ψ(x)ψ(y) = ψ(y)ψ(x) on DS for all x, y ∈Rd,
the object ψ(xm)∗. . . ψ(x1)∗(resp. ψ(y1) . . . ψ(yn)) in the above expres-
sions can be replaced by ψ(xσ(1))∗. . . ψ(xσ(m))∗with any σ ∈Sm (resp.
ψ(yσ(1)) . . . ψ(yσ(n)) with any σ ∈Sn).
We here recall a concept concerning sesquilinear forms on a Hilbert
space. Let H be a Hilbert space and D be a subspace of H . A sesquilinear
form q : D × D →C on D is said to be equal to a linear operator T on
D if D ⊂D(T ) and ⟨ψ, T φ⟩= q(ψ, φ), ψ, φ ∈D. In this case we write
T = q on D.
In this case q is said to have an operator representation T .
Proposition 9.7. Let h be a polynomially bounded function on Rd (see
Subsection D.3.2). Then
dΓb(h) =
Z
Rd h(x)ψ(x)∗ψ(x)dx
on DS .
(9.75)
In particular,
Nb =
Z
Rd ψ(x)∗ψ(x)dx
on DS .
 

538
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Since h is polynomially bounded, it follows that DS ⊂DC,h. Then
(9.71) implies (9.75).
Remark 9.6. Proposition 9.7 gives a mathematically rigorous meaning to
the informal symbol “
R
Rd h(x)ψ(x)∗ψ(x)dx” used in physics literatures on
QFT.
In applications, the case where LF is a symmetric form is particularly
important. Hence let us see when LF becomes a symmetric form. We ﬁrst
note the following fact:
Lemma 9.14. Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS such that Ψ(r) = 0 for all r ̸= m and
Φ(r) = 0 for all r ̸= n. Then, for all (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) ∈Rd(m+n),
KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
=
√
m!n!Ψ(m)(x1, . . . , xm)∗Φ(n)(y1, . . . , yn).
(9.76)
Proof. By (9.73), we see that, for all p ≥1,
(ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(p) = 0, (ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ)(p) = 0
and
(ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(0) =
√
m!Ψ(m)(xm, . . . , x1),
(ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ)(0) =
√
n!Φ(n)(yn, . . . , y1).
Since Ψ(m) and Φ(n) are permutation symmetric, (9.76) follows.
Proposition 9.8. Let F ∈S ′(Rd(m+n)) and F ̸= 0. Then LF is symmet-
ric if and only if m = n and
F(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn)∗= F(y1, . . . , yn, x1, . . . , xn)
(9.77)
in the sense of distribution.
Proof. Suppose that LF is symmetric.
Then, for all Ψ, Φ ∈DS ,
LF (Ψ, Φ)∗= LF(Φ, Ψ), which implies that F(KΨ,Φ)∗= F(KΦ,Ψ) · · · (∗).
Let Ψ be such that Ψ(r) = 0 for all r ≥m + 1 and n > m. Then, by (9.73),
ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Ψ = 0. Hence KΦ,Ψ = 0. Therefore, by (∗), F(KΨ,Φ) = 0.
By (9.73) again, we have (ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(ℓ) = 0 for all ℓ≥1. Hence,
by using Lemma 9.14, we obtain F((Ψ(m))∗× Φ(n)) = 0. This implies that
F = 0. But this contradicts the assumption F ̸= 0. Hence n ≤m. Sim-
ilarly one can show that n ≥m. Thus n = m. In this case, (∗) implies
(9.77) in the sense of distribution.
 

Non-relativistic QFT
539
Conversely suppose that (9.77) holds. By the deﬁnition of the complex
conjugate of a tempered distrbution, for all Ψ, Φ ∈DS , LF (Ψ, Φ)∗=
F(KΨ,Φ)∗= F ∗(K∗
Ψ,Φ).
By (9.77) and (9.72), we have F ∗(K∗
Ψ,Φ) =
F(KΦ,Ψ) = LF(Φ, Ψ). Hence LF(Ψ, Φ)∗= LF(Φ, Ψ). Thus LF is sym-
metric.
It is natural to ask when LF has an operator representation. To answer
the question, we ﬁrst note the following fact:
Lemma 9.15. Let Ψ ∈DS and m ≥1, r ≥0. Then
Z
Rdm
∥(Nb + 1)−m/2ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ∥2dx1 · · · dxm ≤m!∥Ψ∥2,
(9.78)
Z
Rdm
∥(Nb + 1)r/2ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ∥2dx1 · · · xm ≤∥N (r+m)/2
b
Ψ∥2. (9.79)
Proof. By (9.73), we have for all p ≥0
Z
Rdm ∥(Nb + 1)−m/2ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(p)∥2dx1 · · · dxm
= (p + 1)−m(p + 1) · · · (p + m)∥Ψ(p+m)∥2
≤m!∥Ψ(p+m)∥2.
Taking the summation with respect to p ≥0, we obtain (9.78).
Similarly, we have from (9.73)
Z
Rdm ∥((Nb + 1)r/2ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(p)∥2dx1 · · · dxm
= (p + 1)r(p + 1) · · · (p + m)∥Ψ(p+m)∥2
≤(p + m)r+m∥Ψ(p+m)∥2 = ∥(N (r+m)/2
b
Ψ)(p+m)∥2.
Taking the summation with respect to p ≥0, we obtain (9.79).
Theorem 9.12. Let F ∈L2(Rd(m+n)) with m, n ≥1. Then there exists a
unique linear operator TF on Fb(L2(Rd)) such that D(TF ) = DS and
TF =
Z
Rd(m+n F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)ψ(x1)∗· · · ψ(xm)∗
×ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)dx1 · · · dxmdy1 · · · dyn
(9.80)
on DS and
∥TFΦ∥≤
√
m! ∥F∥L2∥(Nb + 1)(m+n)/2Φ∥,
Φ ∈DS .
In particular, if F satisﬁes (9.77), then TF is a symmetric operator.
 

540
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS . Then, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
|LF(Ψ, Φ)| ≤∥F∥L2∥KΨ,Φ∥L2.
We have
|KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)|
=

(Nb + 1)−m/2ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ

(Nb + 1)m/2ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ
 .
By this inequality and Lemma 9.15, we have
∥KΨ,Φ∥2
L2 ≤m!∥Ψ∥2∥N (m+n)/2
b
Φ∥2.
Hence
|LF (Ψ, Φ)| ≤
√
m!∥F∥L2∥Ψ∥∥(Nb + 1)(m+n)/2Φ∥.
The operator (Nb + 1)(m+n)/2 is a bijection on DS . Hence, by Theorem
2.1, there exists a unique linear operator TF on Fb(L2(Rd)) such that
D(TF ) = DS and LF = TF on DS .
The case where F ̸∈L2(Rd(m+n)) also may be interesting. A typical
example in such a case is given as follows. Let F be a tempered distribution
on Rd(m+n) of the following form:
F(x1, . . . , xm+n) = χ(Xm+n−p)δ(xi1 −xj1) · · · δ(xip −xjp),
where 0 ≤2p ≤m + n, 1 ≤ik, jk ≤m + n, {i1, . . . , ip} ∩{j1, . . . , jp} = ∅,
i1 < i2 < · · · < ip, and χ is a tempered distribution on Rd(m+n−p) such
that the variable Xm+n−p ∈Rd(m+n−p) does not contain xj1, . . . , xjp. In
this case, we write LF as follows:
LF =
Z
Rd(m+n−p) dx1 · · · d
dxj1 · · · d
dxjp · · · dxm+nχ(Xm+n−p)
×

ψ(x1)∗· · · ψ(xm)∗ψ(xm+1) · · · ψ(xm+n)

xjk=xik ,k=1,...,p,
where d
dxjk indicates the omission of dxjk and [G]xjk =xik the replacement
of xjk with xik in G.
Example 9.1. (1) Let χ be in S ′(Rd). Then
Z
R2d dxdyχ(x)δ(x −y)ψ(x)∗ψ(y) =
Z
Rd dxχ(x)ψ(x)∗ψ(x).
(2) Let ϕ be in S ′(R2d). Then
Z
R4d dx1dx2dy1dy2ϕ(x1, y1)δ(x1 −x2)δ(y1 −y2)
×ψ(x1)∗ψ(x2)∗ψ(y1)ψ(y2)
=
Z
R2d dxdyϕ(x, y)ψ(x)∗ψ(x)∗ψ(y)ψ(y).
 

Non-relativistic QFT
541
As an extension of the sesquilinear form LF , one can also treat the
case where F is replaced by a partial diﬀerential operator. Here we con-
sider only a simple case.
Let P(x) be a polynomial in x1, . . . , xd ∈R
(x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈Rd). Then the partial diﬀerential operator P(∂x) :=
P(∂1, . . . , ∂d) is deﬁned. For each Ψ ∈DS and x ∈Rd, ψ(x)Ψ ∈DS (see
Lemma 9.12). Hence we can deﬁne P(∂x)ψ(x)Ψ ∈DS by
(P(∂x)ψ(x)Ψ)(n)(x1, . . . , xn)
:=
√
n + 1P(∂x)Ψ(n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn), n ≥0, (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rdn.
Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS and F ∈S ′(R2d). Then, ⟨ψ(x)Ψ, P(∂y)ψ(y)Φ⟩is an
element in S (R2d) (cf. Lemma 9.13). Hence
LP
F (Ψ, Φ) :=
Z
R2d dxdyF(x, y) ⟨ψ(x)Ψ, P(∂y)ψ(y)Φ⟩
gives a sesquilinear form on DS .
This sesquilinear form is symbolically
written as
LP
F =
Z
R2d dxdyF(x, y)ψ(x)∗P(∂y)ψ(y).
In particular, in the case where F(x, y) = δ(x −y), we write
Z
R2d dxdyδ(x −y)ψ(x)∗P(∂y)ψ(y) =
Z
Rd dxψ(x)∗P(∂)ψ(x).
9.7
Hamiltonians as Sesquilinear Forms
In this section, we show that Hamiltonians of a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
can be deﬁned as sesquilinear forms.
9.7.1
A Hamiltonian with an external ﬁeld
Let HdB(V ) be the Hamiltonian given by (9.60).
Proposition 9.9. Suppose that S (Rd) ⊂D(V ) and V ∈S ′(Rd) in addi-
tion. Then
HdB(V ) =

(9.81)
on DS .
Proof. We denote by ∆x the Laplacian in the variable x. Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS .
In quite the same way as in the proof of Proposition 9.6, one ca show that
⟨Ψ, dΓb(∆x)Φ⟩=
Z
Rd ⟨ψ(x)Ψ, ∆xψ(x)Φ⟩dx.
 

542
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence dΓb(∆x) =
R
Rd dxψ(x)∗∆xψ(x) on DS . By Proposition 9.6, we
have
dΓb(V ) =
Z
Rd dxψ(x)∗V (x)ψ(x)
on DS . Thus (9.81) follows.
Proposition 9.9 gives a mathematically rigorous meaning to the heuristic

tum de Broglie ﬁeld in a classical external ﬁeld V which appears in physics
literatures on QFT.
9.7.2
A Hamiltonian of
a
self-interacting
quantum de
Broglie ﬁeld
We next consider a self-interacting quantum de Broglie ﬁeld. Let U be a
real-valued Borel measurable function on Rd × Rd which is a.e. ﬁnite with
respect to the 2d-dimensional Lebesgue measure and symmetric: U(x, y) =
U(y, x), a.e.(x, y) ∈R2d. For n ≥2, we deﬁne
U (n)(x1, . . . , xn) :=
X
1≤i<j≤n
U(xi, xj)
= 1
2
n
X
i,j=1
i̸=j
U(xi, xj),
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rdn.
Physically U (n) describes an interaction of n quantum particles.
Example 9.2. In the case d = 3, the Coulomb potential between two
charged particles with electric charge q ∈R and q′ ∈R respectively is given
by VC(x −y) (x, y ∈R3, x ̸= y) with
VC(x) :=
qq′
4πε0|x|,
x ∈R3 \ {0},
where ε0 > 0 denotes the dielectric constant of the vacuum (MKSA unit
system). An example of U(x, y) is given by U(x, y) = VC(x −y).
The multiplication operator U (n) on L2(Rdn) is self-adjoint. It is easy
to see that, for all n ≥2, U (n) is reduced by L2
sym((Rd)n) and its reduced
part to L2
sym((Rd)n) is the multiplication operator by the same function
U (n).

The sequence {U (n)}∞
n=2 of self-adjoint operators yields the inﬁnite di-
rect sum operator
U := 0 ⊕0 ⊕

acting in the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)).
By Theorem 4.2(vi), U is
self-adjoint. Physically the operator U describes an interaction of inﬁnitely
many bosons. The Hamiltonian of a bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld which
takes into account this interaction is given by
HdB(V, U) := HdB(V ) + U.
(9.82)
This operator is reduced by each n-particle space L2
sym((Rd)n) and its re-
duced part HdB(V, U)(n) is given by
HdB(V, U)(n) =

Note that S(n)
V,U with n ≥2 is an n-body Schr¨odinger operator.
Proposition 9.10. Suppose that, for all n ∈N, S(n)
V,U is self-adjoint. Then:
(i) HdB(V, U) is self-adjoint.
(ii) Let En := inf σ(S(n)
V,U) (n ∈N).
Then HdB(V, U) is bounded from
below if and only if λ0 := infn∈N En > −∞.
In that case, λ0 =
inf σ(HdB(V, U)).
Proof. (i) By the above arguments, we have
HdB(V, U) = ⊕∞
n=0S(n)
V,U.
Hence the self-adjointness of S(n)
V,U (n ∈N) implies that of HdB(V, U) (apply
Theorem 4.2(vi)).
(ii) This part follows from a simple application of Theorem 4.4(iv).
We next consider the case where U ∈S ′
R(R2d) and U(x, y) = U(y, x)
in the sense of tempered distribution. Then, by Example 9.1(2), the sym-
metric sesquilinear form

Example 9.3. A physically interesting example is given by the case
U(x, y) = λδ(x −y) with λ ∈R. This is called a δ-type interaction.
But, in this case, H(U)
I
cannot be an operator on Fb(L2(Rd)).
To sum up, it has been shown that, under the aforementioned condition
for V and U,
HdB(V, U) =

on DS in the sense of sesquilinear form. In this way, to heuristic or infor-
mal expressions of Hamiltonians in non-relativistic QFT which are used in
physics literatures, a mathematically rigorous meaning is given as sesquilin-
ear forms. Moreover, the results in this section show that the Hamiltonian
HdB(V, U) gives a uniﬁcation of the standard Hamiltonians (Schr¨odinger
Hamiltonians) of many-body quantum systems in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics. In this sense, for each n ∈N, the quantum theory of the n-body
system can be viewed as a part of a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld theory.
Remark 9.7. The ﬁnite volume version of the Hamiltonian HdB(V, U) with
d = 3, V = 0 and a δ-type interaction U(x, y) = gδ(x −y) (g > 0) is used
as a Hamiltonian for superﬂuidity in physics literatures.
But, in this
case, HdB(V, U) is not deﬁned as an operator on Fb(L2(VL)), where VL :=
[−L/2, L/2]3 ⊂R3 (L > 0) is the ﬁnite volume set under consideration (see
Subsection 9.9.1). A way to avoid this diﬃculty is to replace gδ(x−y) with
a suitable function gW(x −y) (see Subsection 14.2.3) and then to take a
limit W(x) →δ(x) in a suitable sense (e.g., in terms of vacuum expectation
values of the quantum ﬁelds under consideration) to construct a quantum
ﬁeld theory with the δ-type interaction.
Remark 9.8. One can consider the formal Heisenberg ﬁeld operator ψ(t, x)
( (t, x) ∈R1+d) of ψ(x) with respect to HdB(V, U):
ψ(t, x) := eitHdB(V,U)/ℏψ(x)e−itHdB(V,U)/ℏ.
Then, using the CCR of ψ(x)#, one can formally show that ψ(t, x) obeys

A Fermionic Quantum de Broglie Field
In parallel to the theory of a bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld given in
Section 9.4, we can construct a theory of a fermionic quantum de Broglie
ﬁeld, which describes non-relativistic fermions.
9.8.1
Hilbert space for state vectors
As mentioned in Section 5.1, a fermion has a half-integer spin s. In this
case, the state space of the spin degree of freedom is given by C2s+1. Hence
a natural one-particle Hilbert space of a fermion with spin s moving in
the conﬁguration space Rd is given by L2(Rd; C2s+1), the Hilbert space of
C2s+1-valued square integrable functions on Rd (see Section 2.7 for this
type of Hilbert space). We have the natural isomorphism L2(Rd; C2s+1) ∼=
L2(Rd) ⊗C2s+1.
Let
S = {−s, −s + 1, . . . , s −1, s},
which is the set of eigenvalues of a spin operator, and write an element in
L2(Rd; C2s+1) as
f = (f−s, . . . , fs) = (fr)r∈S.
The function fr describes a one-particle state with spin angular momentum
r.
Let us construct a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with spin s on the fermion
Fock space

Annihilation and creation operators
We denote by c(f) (f ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1)) the annihilation operator on the
fermion Fock space Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) (see Section 6.6). As we have seen
in Chapter 6, c(f) is an everywhere deﬁned bounded linear operator on
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) and
∥c(f)∥= ∥f∥=
v
u
u
t
s
X
r=−s
∥fr∥2.
For each r ∈S and u ∈L2(Rd), we deﬁne a bounded operator cr(u) on
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) by
cr(u) = c(0, . . . , 0,
rth
⌣u , 0, . . . , 0).
Then, for any f = (fr)r∈S ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1), we have
c(f) =
X
r∈S
cr(fr).
An application of Theorem 6.13 yields the following anti-commutation re-
lations: for all u, v ∈L2(Rd) and r, r′ ∈S,
{cr(u), cr′(v)∗} = δrr′ ⟨u, v⟩,
{cr(u), cr′(v)} = 0,
{cr(u)∗, cr′(v)∗} = 0.
Under the identiﬁcation (9.85), cr(u) and cr(u)∗(u ∈L2(Rd)) take the
following forms: for all Ψ ∈Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)),
(cr(u)Ψ)(n)

domain Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)).

A fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
Let U : Rd →M2s+1(C) (the set of complex (2s + 1) × (2s + 1) matrices)
such that each (r, r′)-component Urr′ of U is Borel measurable, a.e. ﬁnite
and U(x)∗= U(x) (Hermiteness) a.e.x ∈Rd. This kind of matrix-valued
functions on Rd is called a matrix-valued potential on Rd. Then the
one-particle Hamiltonian of a fermion in this potential is deﬁned by
hU,s := −ℏ2
2m∆+ U
acting in L2(Rd; C2s+1) (note that (Uf)r := Ps
j=−s Urjfj, f ∈D(U)).
Suppose that hU,s is essentially self-adjoint. For each f ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1),
we deﬁne a fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld at time t ∈R by
ψU,s(t, f) := c(eithU,s/ℏf ∗).
In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 9.11, one can prove the following
fact:
Theorem 9.13. For all f
∈
D(hU,s) and Ψ
∈
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)),
ψU,s(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
iℏd
dtψ(s)
U (t, f)Ψ = ψU,s(t, hU,sf)Ψ.
Using the fermion second quantization operator
HdB,s(U) := dΓf(hU,s),
we have
ψU,s(t, f) = eitHdB,s(U)/ℏψ(f)e−itHdB,s(U)/ℏ,
f ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1).
Hence HdB,s(U) can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian in the present case.
In the case U = 0, we have
ψ0,s(t, f) = ψ(e−itℏ2∆/2mf ∗).
This is called the free fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with spin
s.
Remark 9.9. Spectral analysis and considerations of Galilean symmetry
in the fermionic quantum de Broglie theory can be made in quite the same
way as in the case of the bosonic one. The reader is asked to provide the
details of them (apply the theory of fermion Fock space given in Chapter
6).

We call cr(x) the fermion annihilation operator with spin r at the point x.
In the same way as in the case of the boson annihilation operator ψ(x)
at the point x, one can prove the following proposition:
Proposition 9.11.
(i) For all x ∈Rd and r ∈S, D(cr(x)∗) = {0}. In particular, cr(x) is
not closable.

QFT on a Bounded Space Region
So far we have considered quantum de Broglie ﬁelds on the inﬁnitely ex-
tended space-time R1+d = R × Rd. But one can also consider those on a
bounded space region. In fact, in many of physics literatures on QFT, they
start with a QFT on a ﬁnite box in space and then take the inﬁnite volume
 

Non-relativistic QFT
549
limit to obtain a QFT on R1+d. One of the reasons for taking such a pro-
cedure is that a QFT on R × M with M ⊂Rd being bounded may be less
singular, more tractable and also serve as a ﬁnite volume approximation
to a QFT on R × Rd. From mathematical physics points of view, it may
be interesting to compare a QFT on a bounded space region with that on
R1+d. Taking into account these points of view, we describe in this section
basic elements in a ﬁnite volume QFT.
9.9.1
QFT on a cubic box
For simplicity, we take as a bounded space region the d-dimensional cubic
box
VL :=

(9.86)
with L > 0 being the length of each edge. A Hilbert space of state vec-
tors of a one-particle system on VL with r internal degrees of freedom
(r ∈N) is taken to be L2(VL; Cr). The Fock space Fb(L2(VL; Cr)) (resp.
Ff(L2(VL; Cr))) gives a framework describing bosonic (resp.
fermionic)
QFT models on VL. To avoid unnecessary complexities, we consider a Bose
ﬁeld on VL with r = 1. Moreover, it turns out that it is convenient to work
with the momentum representation which is deﬁned below. The momentum
space dual to VL is given by
ΓL := 2π
L Z =
2π
L n|n ∈Z

.
Then the set
ℓ2(ΓL) :=
(
ψ : ΓL →C|
X

|ψ(k)|2 < ∞
)
,
is a Hilbert space with inner product
⟨ψ, φ⟩:=
X
k∈ΓL
ψ(k)∗φ(k),
ψ, φ ∈ℓ2(ΓL).
For each k ∈ΓL, we deﬁne a function φk : VL →C by
φk(x) :=
1
Ld/2 eik·x,
x ∈VL.
It is well known that {φk|k ∈ΓL} is a CONS of L2(VL).
Hence there
exists a unique unitary transformation F (L)
d
: L2(VL) →ℓ2(ΓL), called the
discrete Fourier transform , such that, for all f ∈L2(VL) and k ∈ΓL,
ˆf(k) := F (L)
d
f(k) = ⟨φk, f⟩L2(VL) .
(9.87)
 

550
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence
Γb(F (L)
d
)Fb(L2(VL)) = Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
In this way Fb(L2(VL)) is naturally isomorphic to Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
In what follows, we use the natural identiﬁcation of ⊗n
s ℓ2(ΓL) with
the Hilbert space ℓ2
sym(Γn
L) consisting of functions ψ(n) ∈ℓ2(Γn
L) which is
symmetric (see Section 2.10): for all (k1, . . . , kn) ∈Γn
L and σ ∈Sn,
ψ(n)(kσ(1), . . . , kσ(n)) = ψ(n)(k1, . . . , kn).
Hence Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) is identiﬁed with ⊕∞
n=0ℓ2
sym(Γn
L) (ℓ2
sym(Γ0
L) := C).
For each k ∈ΓL, one can deﬁne an operator aL(k) on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) as
follows:
D(aL(k)) :=

n + 1Ψ(n+1)(k, k1, . . . , kn),
Ψ ∈D(aL(k)), (k1, . . . , kn) ∈Γn
L, n ≥0.
Note that aL(k) is a discrete analogue of ψ(x) deﬁnde by (9.63). But, in
contrast to ψ(x), aL(k) is a closed linear operator (Problem 10). It is easy
to see that Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) ⊂D(aL(k)). Hence aL(k) is a densely deﬁned
closed operator. Moreover, it is shown that the adjoint aL(k)∗is given by
the following form: Ψ ∈D(aL(k)∗) if and only if

Using these formulae, one can show that aL(k)# leaves Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) in-
variant satisfying the canonical commutation relations: for all k, k′ ∈ΓL,
[aL(k), aL(k′)∗] = δkk′,
[aL(k), aL(k′)] = 0,
[aL(k)∗, aL(k′)∗] = 0

on Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
Let aL(f) be the annihilation operator with test vector f ∈ℓ2(ΓL) on
Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) (we distinguish aL(f) from aL(k) by their arguments). Then,
for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) and f ∈ℓ2(ΓL),
aL(f)Ψ =

aL(k)# = aL(δk)#,
(9.88)
where δk ∈ℓ2(ΓL) is deﬁned by δk(k′) := δkk′, k′ ∈ΓL.
It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(aL(k)∗a(k)),

For a densely deﬁned closable operator T on ℓ2(ΓL), we denote by

This shows a big diﬀerence between the ﬁnite volume theory and the

Note that SL includes the subspace
ℓ0(ΓL) := {f : ΓL →C|∃K > 0 such that if |k| ≥K, then f(k) = 0 }
which is dense in ℓ2(ΓL). Hence SL is dense in ℓ2(ΓL).
Lemma 9.16. Let g : ΓL →C be such that, for some α ≥0,

(1 + k2)α < ∞.
Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(SL), P

Proof. Since Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(SL), it is suﬃcient to show that, for each n ∈N,
S :=

For all N > d/2, the right hand side is ﬁnite. Thus S < ∞.
Remark 9.11. As for the creation operator aL(k)∗, Lemma 9.16 does not
hold (e.g., P
k∈ΓL g(k)aL(k)∗Ωℓ2(ΓL) converges if and only if g ∈ℓ2(ΓL)).
In this sense aL(k)∗is singular than aL(k).

The operator-valued function ψL(t, x) can be regarded as a free bosonic
quantum de Broglie ﬁeld without smearing test functions:
Theorem 9.15. Let Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(SL). Then ψL(t, x)Ψ is inﬁnitely diﬀer-
entiable in t and xj ∈[−L/2, L/2] (j = 1, . . . , d) in the strong sense and

show that, for all n ∈N, P

one can show that ψL(t, x)Ψ is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable in (t, x) in the strong

k ∈ΓL,
where χCL(k) is the characteristic function of CL(k). Then it is easy to see
that {ek,L|k ∈ΓL} is an orthonormal system in L2(Rd). Each f ∈ℓ2(ΓL)
satisﬁes that P
k∈ΓL |f(k)|2 < ∞. Hence
JLf :=
X
k∈ΓL
f(k)ek,L
converges in L2(Rd) and
∥JLf∥2
L2(Rd) =
X
k∈ΓL
|f(k)|2 = ∥f∥2
ℓ2(ΓL).
Hence the mapping JL : ℓ2(ΓL) →L2(Rd) (f 7→JLf) is an isometry. Let
ML(Rd) := {f ∈L2(Rd)|for each k ∈ΓL, f ↾CL(k) is a constant}.
Then it is easy to see that
RanJL = ML.
Hence ℓ2(ΓL) is isomorphic to ML.
Therefore the boson Fock space
Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) is isomorphic to the boson Fock space Fb(ML) under the uni-
tary transformation
UL := Γb(JL) : Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) →Fb(ML).
We denote by a(f) (f ∈L2(Rd)) the annihilation operator with test
vector f on Fb(L2(Rd)) and, for each k ∈ΓL, we deﬁne an operator AL(k)
on Fb(L2(Rd)) by
AL(k) := a(ek,L).
 

Non-relativistic QFT

Then it is easy to see that the following canonical commutation relations
hold on Fb,0(L2(Rd)): for all k, k′ ∈ΓL,
[AL(k), AL(k′)∗] = δkk′,
(9.91)
[AL(k), AL(k′)] = 0,
[AL(k)∗, AL(k′)∗] = 0.
(9.92)
Since ML is a closed subspace of L2(Rd), it follows that Fb(ML) can be
regarded as a subspace of Fb(L2(Rd)) in a natural way. Let pL : L2(Rd) →
ML be the orthogonal projection onto ML. Then, by Theorem 5.6(v),
PL := Γb(pL)
is the orthogonal projection from Fb(L2(Rd)) onto Fb(ML).
Lemma 9.17. For each k ∈ΓL, AL(k)# is reduced by Fb(ML) and
ULaL(k)#U −1
L
= AL(k)#
as operator equalities on Fb(ML).
Proof. The reducibility of AL(k)# by Fb(ML) follows from Theorem 5.15.
By (9.88) and Theorem 5.30,
ULaL(k)#U −1
L
= a(JLδk)# = a(ek,L)# = AL(k)#
as an operator equality in Fb(ML).
We next consider the transformation of a second quantization operator
on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) under UL.
For each p ∈Rd, there is a unique point pL ∈ΓL such that p ∈CL(pL).
For each f ∈C(Rd), we deﬁne fΓL : ΓL →C by
fΓL(k) := f(k),
k ∈ΓL.
We also introduce a function fL : Rd →C by
fL(p) := f(pL),
p ∈Rd.
It is obvious that fL ↾ΓL = fΓL. Note also that
fL =
X
k∈ΓL
f(k)χCL(k).

Lemma 9.18. Let E ∈C(Rd) and denote the multiplication operators
by the functions EΓL and EL by the same symbols respectively.
Then
JLEΓL J−1

Proof. Let f ∈ML ∩D(EL). Then, for all p ∈Rd,
(JLEΓL J−1
L f)(p) =

k∈ΓL
E(k)(J−1
L f)(k)ek,L(p)

L f)(pL)epL,L(p) = EL(p)f(p).
Thus the desired result follows.
For a densely deﬁned closable operator T on L2(Rd), we denote by
dΓb(T ) the second quantization of T on Fb(L2(Rd)).
Theorem 9.16. ULdΓ(L)
b (EΓL )U −1
L
= dΓb(EL) as an operator equality on
Fb(ML).
Proof. We have Theorem 5.8 and Lemma 9.18
ULdΓ(L)
b (EΓL )U −1
L
= dΓb(JLEΓLJ−1
L ) = dΓb(EL)
as an operator equality on Fb(ML).
Thus we see that the ﬁnite volume theory (Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), {aL(k), aL(k)∗
|k ∈ΓL}, dΓ(L)
b (EΓL )) is equivalent to the theory (Fb(ML), {AL(k),
AL(k)∗|k ∈ΓL}, dΓb(EL)). Since Fb(ML) is a closed subspace of the
boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)) which is a Hilbert space for an inﬁnite vol-
ume theory, it may be convenient to consider the inﬁnite volume limit of the
ﬁnite volume theory in terms of the theory (Fb(ML), {AL(k), AL(k)∗|k ∈
ΓL}, dΓb(EL)).
9.9.3
Inﬁnite volume limit
Lemma 9.19. Let f ∈C(Rd). Then, for all p ∈Rd, limL→∞fL(p) =
f(p).
Proof. Let p ∈Rd be ﬁxed. Then, by the continuity of f on Rd, for any
ε > 0, there exists a constant δ > 0 such that, if p′ ∈Rd, |p′ −p| < δ,
then |f(p′) −f(p)| < ε. We have |pL −p| ≤2π
√
d/L. Hence, letting
L0 := 2π
√
d/δ, we have |fL(p) −f(p)| = |f(pL) −f(p)| < ε for all L > L0.
Thus limL→∞fL(p) = f(p).
The next lemma plays an important role in taking the inﬁnite volume
limit L →∞:
Lemma 9.20. Let f ∈C0(Rd). Then

Rd f(p)dp.

Non-relativistic QFT
559
Proof. There exists a constant R > 0 such that supp f ⊂[−R, R]d for
some R > 0. Let L > 1. Then supp fL ⊂K := [−R −2π, R + 2π]d. Since
the function fL is a step function (see (9.93)), it follows that
Z
Rd fL(p)dp =
X
k∈ΓL
f(k)
2π
L

.
We have |fL(p)| ≤∥f∥∞= supp∈Rd |f(p)| < ∞. Every constant func-
tion on K is integrable on K. Hence, by Lemma 9.19 and the Lebesgue
dominated convergence theorem, we obtain
lim
L→∞
Z
Rd fL(p)dp =
Z
Rd f(p)dp.
Thus (9.94) holds.
Lemma 9.21. Let f ∈C0(Rd). Then
lim
L→∞∥fL −f∥L2(Rd) = 0.
(9.95)
Proof. It is obvious that fL and f are in L2(Rd). Let K ⊂Rd be as in
the proof of Lemma 9.20. Then
∥fL −f∥2
L2(Rd) =
Z
K
g(L)(p)dp
with g(L)(p) := |fL(p)−f(p)|2. By Lemma 9.19, limL→∞g(L)(p) = 0, ∀p ∈
Rd. Moreover
0 ≤g(L)(p) ≤2(|fL(p)|2 + |f(p)|2) ≤2(∥f∥2
∞+ |f(p)|2)
and
R
K 2(∥f∥2
∞+ |f(p)|2)dp < ∞.
Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated
convergence theorem, limL→∞
R
K g(L)(p)dp = 0. Thus (9.95) holds.

AL(f) :=

This suggests that AL(f) may have an inﬁnite volume limit in a suitable
sense. Indeed, one has the following theorem. We denote by Nb the number
operator on Fb(L2(Rd)).
Theorem 9.17. For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
) and f ∈C0(Rd),
lim
L→∞AL(f)#Ψ = a(f)#Ψ.
(9.96)
Proof. It is easy to see that
AL(f) = a(fL).
Hence D(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(AL(f)) and, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
),
∥AL(f)#Ψ −a(f)#Ψ∥≤∥fL −f∥L2(Rd)∥(Nb + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
where we have used (8.1) and (8.2). By Lemma 9.21, the right hand side
converges to 0 as L →∞. Thus (9.96) holds.
(B) Convergence of free Hamiltonians
Let E ∈C(Rd). Then C0(Rd) ⊂D(EL) ∩D(E).
Lemma 9.22. For all f ∈C0(Rd), limL→∞ELf = Ef.
Proof. There exists a number R > 0 such that supp f ⊂[−R, R]d. Then,
for all p ∈supp f, pL ∈[−R −2π, R + 2π]d (L > 1). We have
∥ELf −Ef∥2 =
Z
supp f
GL(p)dp,
where GL(p) := (E(pL)−E(p))2 |f(p)|2. By Lemma 9.19, limL→∞GL(p)
= 0. Putting M := supp∈[−R−2π,R+2π]d |E(p)|, we have
|GL(p)| ≤4M 2|f(p)|2,
p ∈supp f.
Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
lim
L→∞
Z
supp f
GL(p)dp = 0.
Thus limL→∞∥ELf −Ef∥2 = 0.
Theorem 9.18. Let E be a real-valued continuous function on Rd. Then:

561
(i) The operator dΓb(EL) converges to dΓb(E) in the strong resolvent
sense as L →∞, i.e., for all z ∈C \ R,
s- lim
L→∞(dΓb(EL) −z)−1 = (dΓb(E) −z)−1,
where s- lim means strong limit.
(ii) For all t ∈R, s- limL→∞e−itdΓb(EL)/ℏ= e−itdΓb(E)/ℏ.
(iii) If E ≥0, then, for all β > 0, s- limL→∞e−βdΓb(EL) = e−βdΓb(E).
Proof. The subspace C0(Rd) is a core for the multiplication operator E.
By this fact and Lemma 9.22, we can apply Theorem 5.19 to obtain the
desired results.
As for norm resolvent convergecne of {dΓb(EL)}L, we have the following
theorem.
Theorem 9.19. Let E be a nonnegative continuous function on Rd. Sup-
pose that, for each L > 1, there exists a constant εL > 0 such that
limL→∞εL = 0 and
|EL(p) −E(p)| ≤εLE(p),
p ∈Rd.
Then:
(i) The operator dΓb(EL) converges to dΓb(E) in the norm resolvent sense
as L →∞.
(ii) For all β > 0, s- limL→∞∥e−βdΓb(EL) −e−βdΓb(E)∥= 0.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(C0(Rd)). Then Ψ ∈D(dΓb(E)) ∩D(dΓb(EL)) for
all L > 0 and
∥dΓb(EL)Ψ −dΓb(E)Ψ∥2 =

Hence ∥dΓb(EL)Ψ−dΓb(E)Ψ∥≤εL∥dΓb(E)Ψ∥. Note that Fb,ﬁn(C0(Rd))
is a core for dΓb(E). Hence we can apply Theorem 1.42 to conclude that
part(i) holds. Part (ii) follows from (i) and Corollary 1.8(iii).

Example 9.5. The energy of a free relativistic particle of mass m > 0 with
momentum ℏk ∈Rd is given by
ER(k) =
p
ℏ2k2 + m2
in the physical unit system where the light speed c = 1. For all k, q ∈Rd,
we have
|ER(k) −ER(q)| =
|k2 −q2|

ℏ2k2 + m2 +
p

where
C(k, q) :=

ℏ2k2 + m2 +
p
(ℏ2q2 + m2)(ℏ2k2 + m2)
.
Using the obvious inequality |p| ≤

C(k, q) ≤2ℏ/m. Moreover,
| |kL| −|k| | ≤|kL −k| ≤2π

Hence
|ER(kL) −ER(k)| ≤εLER(k)
with εL := 4πℏ

d/Lm. It is obvious that εL →0 (L →∞). Hence the
function ER satisﬁes the assumption of Theorem 9.19. Thus, in the present
example, The conclusions of Theorem 9.19 hold.
(C) Convergence of the Hamiltonians of the free quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld on VL
Let ENR be deﬁned by (9.35) and deﬁne
ˆH(L)
dB := dΓb(ENR,L),
where ENR,L(p) := ENR(pL), p ∈Rd. Then, by Theorem 9.16, ˆH(L)
dB ↾
Fb(ML) ∩D(dΓb(ENR,L)) is unitarily equivalent to the Hamiltonian H(L)
dB
of the free quantum de Broglie ﬁeld on VL. Applying Theorem 9.18 to the
case E = ENR, we obtain the following corollary (note that ENR ≥0).
Corollary 9.2. Let ˆHdB be deﬁned by (9.38).
(i) The operator ˆH(L)
dB converges to ˆHdB in the strong resolvent sense as
L →∞.

(iii) For all β > 0, s- limL→∞e−β ˆ

Part (ii) in Corollary 9.2 tells us that the time development in the
ﬁnite volume theory converges to that in the inﬁnite volume theory as
L →∞.
Theorem 9.17 and Corollary 9.2 show that the ﬁnite volume
theory presented here is a suitable one approximating the inﬁnite volume
theory.
Remark 9.12. It is easy to see that
|ENR,L(k) −ENR(k)| ≤ℏ2π
√
d
mL
(|kL| + |k|),
k ∈Rd.
But there exists no constant C > 0 such that |kL| + |k| ≤CENR(k), k ∈
Rd · · · (∗) (suppose that (∗) holded. Then, for all k ∈CL(0) \ {0}, kL = 0
so that 1 ≤ℏ2C|k|/2m. But this is a contradiction). This suggests that
ˆH(L)
dB does not converge to ˆHdB in the norm resolvent sense as L →∞.
Indeed this is true, but we omit proving this fact (Problem 13).

We have the orthogonal decomposition
L2(Rd) = ML ⊕M ⊥

2mf |∇u(t, x)|2 + V (x)|u(t, x)|2 + λ
2 |u(t, x)|4
for H denotes the energy density of the system under consideration.
Hence H is interpreted as the total energy of the matter-wave. The
conclusion in (iii) means that the total energy is conserved. In classical

obeying the Gross-Pitaevskii equation under consideration.

Show that dP j/dt = 0 (j = 1, . . . , d).
Remark.
In the context of matter-wave theory, the integrand
−iℏu∗∂ju = u∗ˆpju for P j denotes the jth component of the mo-
mentum density. Hence P j is interpreted as the jth component of

Suppose that V is continuously diﬀerentiable and rotation invari-

Remark. In classical ﬁeld theory, the integrand u(t, x)∗ljku(t, x) for
Ljk means the density of (j, k)-component of the orbital angular

(iv) Show that π(gg′) = eiµ(Rv′·(a−a0v)−1

Remark. In general, a representation ρ of a group G on a Hilbert space
is called a ray representation of G if, for each pair (g, g′) ∈G × G,
there exists a constant c(g, g′) ∈C such that ρ(gg′) = c(g, g′)ρ(g)ρ(g′). The
function c : G×G →C : (g, g′) 7→c(g, g′) is called the 2-cocycle associated
with the ray representation. The fact stated in (iv) shows that {π(g)|g ∈
G1+d} is a ray representation of G1+d.
A moral of (iii) and (iv) is that
the solution space of the non-linear de Broglie-Schr¨odinger equation (9.97)
is invariant under the ray representation {π(g)|g ∈G1+d} (a non-unitary
one) if V is Galilei invariant (i.e., for all g ∈G1+d, V is g-invariant).
(5) Consider the case d = 3 and let
l1 := x2ˆp3 −x3ˆp2, l2 := x3ˆp1 −x1ˆp3, l3 := x1ˆp2 −x2ˆp1,
acting in L2(R3). The operator vector (l1, l2, l3) is called the three
dimensional orbital angular momentum operator. Let Mj :=
dΓb(lj), j = 1, 2, 3. Show that the following commutation relations
hold on Fb,ﬁn(C∞
0 (R3)):
[M1, M2] = iℏM3, [M2, M3] = iℏM1, [M3, M1] = iℏM2.
◮Hint. Apply Theorem 5.4.
Remark. In the notation of Problem 1(v), l1 = l23, l2 = l31, l3 = l12.

Models of relativistic quantum scalar ﬁelds obeying the free Klein-Gordon equa-
tion are constructed in the framework of boson Fock spaces.
10.1
Free Classical Klein-Gordon Field
In this chapter, we construct a quantum ﬁeld whose corresponding classical
ﬁeld is given by a scalar ﬁeld (scalar-valued function) φcl : R1+d →K
(d ∈N) obeying the free Klein-Gordon (KG) equation

φcl(x) = 0,

(10.1)
where □is the (1 + d)-dimensional d’Alembertian (see (8.61)), c > 0 is the
speed of light, and m ≥0 is a parameter denoting the associated boson
mass. The function φcl is called the free classical Klein-Gordon ﬁeld
on the space-time R1+d. In the case K = R (resp. C), φcl is said to be real
(resp. complex or charged).
We ﬁrst consider the case where φcl is real. A heuristic argument to
ﬁnd a general solution to (10.1) is as follows. Let
ˆφcl(x0, k) := (2π)−d/2

(10.2)
Hence
ˆφcl(x0, k) = C1(k)eix0ω(k) + C2(k)e−ix0ω(k).
Here C1(k) and C2(k) are constants which may depend on k, but inde-
pendent of x0. The reality of φcl implies that ˆφcl(x0, k)∗= ˆφcl(x0, −k).
It follows that C1(k)∗= C2(−k). Hence, putting A(k) :=
p
2ω(k)C2(k)
(the multiplication of
p
2ω(k) is just for convenience) and using the Fourier
inversion formula φcl(x) = (2π)−d/2 R

In the case m > 0 (resp. m = 0), the ﬁeld φcl is said to be massive

needs only to note the form of the canonical conjugate momentum πcl given below.

A Sharp-time Free Neutral Quantum KG Field
For notational simplicity, in what follows, we use the physical unit system
where c = 1 and ℏ= 1 unless otherwise stated.
 

572
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We set Rd
k := {k = (k1, . . . , kd)|kj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d}, the wave-number-
vector space. For each f ∈L2(Rd
k), we denote by a(f) the boson annihila-
tion operator with test vector f on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) over
L2(Rd
k). Hence we have the following CCR: for all f, g ∈L2(Rk),
[a(f), a(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩, [a(f), a(g)] = 0, [a(f)∗, a(g)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
For each s ∈R, we introduce a function space:
Hs
ω(Rd) := {f ∈L2(Rd)|ωs ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k)},
(10.8)
where ˆf is the Fourier transform of f and ω is deﬁned by (10.2).2 Note
that, if m > 0, then Hs
ω(Rd) is essentially same as the Sobolev space on Rd
with index s.
For each f ∈Hs
ω(Rd), we deﬁne ∥f∥s ≥0 by
∥f∥s := ∥ωs ˆf∥.
It is easy to see that, if f ∈Hs
ω(Rd), then f ∗∈Hs
ω(Rd).
We also introduce the real space version of Hs
ω(Rd):
Hs
ω,R(Rd) := {f ∈Hs
ω(Rd)|f ∗= f},
s ∈R.
(10.9)
By formally smearing out φ(t, x) and π(t, x) (see (10.6) and (10.7))
with a test function f on Rd
x, one can ﬁnd the following mathematically
well-deﬁned objects:

Note that, for each
t ∈R and all Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)), φ(t, f)Ψ (resp.
π(t, g)Ψ) is linear in
f ∈H−1/2
ω
(Rd) (resp. g ∈H1/2
ω
(Rd)).
It is easy to see that
φ(t, f ∗) ⊂φ(t, f)∗,
π(t, g∗) ⊂π(t, g)∗.
(10.12)
We remark that, in the massless case m = 0 (hence ω(k) = |k|, k ∈Rd),
for all f ∈S (Rd), ˆf/√ω ∈L2(Rd) if and only if d ≥2. This phenomenon
is an example of the so-called infrared divergence in QFT in which a

massless quantum ﬁeld is involved. For this reason, in what follows, we
assume that d ≥2 in the case m = 0.
It is easy to see that, for each t ∈R, the following Heisenberg CCR hold
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)):
[φ(t, f), π(t, g)] = i
Z
Rd f(x)g(x)dx
[φ(t, f), φ(t, g)] = 0,
[π(t, f), π(t, g)] = 0,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Theorem 10.1. Let t ∈R be ﬁxed arbitrarily. Then, for all f ∈H−1/2
ω,R (Rd)
and g ∈H1/2
ω,R(Rd), φ(t, f) and π(t, g) are essentially self-adjoint on
Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
Proof. For all f ∈H−1/2
ω,R (Rd) and g ∈H1/2
ω,R(Rd), we have

on Fb,0(L2(Rd

k))
(see Section 5.9). Hence, by Theorem 5.22, the desired result follows.
Proposition 10.1. For each t ∈R, φ(t, ·) and π(t, ·) are operator-valued
distributions on Rd with common domain D(N 1/2
b
), where Nb is the boson
number operator on Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
Proof. We need only to show that, for all Φ, Ψ
∈
Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)),
⟨Φ, φ(t, ·)Ψ⟩and ⟨Φ, π(t, ·)Ψ⟩are in S ′(Rd). The linearity of these func-
tionals is obvious. We have

Similarly one can prove that ⟨Φ, π(t, ·)Ψ⟩∈S ′(Rd).
Let
Hb := dΓb(ω)
(10.14)
be the boson second quantization of the multiplication operator ω on
L2(Rd
k). Then, by an application of Lemma 5.21, we have the following
theorem:
Theorem 10.2. Let f ∈H−1/2
ω
(Rd) and g ∈H1/2
ω
(Rd).
Then, for all
t ∈R,
φ(t, f) = eitHbφ0(f)e−itHb,
π(t, g) = eitHbπ0(g)e−itHb,
where
φ0(f) := φ(0, f) =

We now derive ﬁeld equations for φ(t, ·) and π(t, ·):

Proof. Apply Lemma 5.22 and use the fact that
(Fd(−∆+ m2)f)(k) = ω(k)2 ˆf(k), f ∈D(∆), a.e.k ∈Rd,
where Fd denotes the Fourier transform on L2(Rd).
Let φ(t, x) (resp. π(t, x)) be the operator-valued distribution kernel of
φ(t, f) (resp. π(t, f)), f ∈S (Rd):
φ(t, f) =
Z
Rd φ(t, x)f(x)dx,
π(t, f) =
Z
Rd π(t, x)f(x)dx.
Then Theorem 10.3 means that
Dtφ(t, x) = π(t, x),
(□+ m2)φ(t, x) = 0
on D(N 1/2
b
) in the sense of operator-valued distribution. By these facts
and Theorem 10.1, φ(t, x) can be interpreted as a quantum version of the
free classical neutral KG ﬁeld.
We call the operator-valued distribution
φ(t, ·) a sharp-time free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld with mass m
and Hb the free Hamiltonian of it (cf. also Remark for Problem 2). The
operator-valued distribution π(t, ·) is called the conjugate momentum of
φ(t, ·).
Let ˆPb,j be given by (9.39) (note that, in the present case, ℏ= 1).
Theorem 10.4. Let f ∈H−1/2

Pb,d · · · e−ia1 ˆ
Pb,1 = φ(t, u(a)f),
where u(a) (a ∈Rd) is deﬁned by (9.24).
Proof. Apply Lemma 5.22 and use the fact that kj = −kj and
eiajkj ˆf = Fd(eiaj ˆpjf) = Fd(u(ajej)f), j = 1, . . . , d,
where {ej ∈Rd|j = 1, . . . , d} is the standard basis of Rd.
Theorem

shows
that
the
quantum
ﬁeld
φ(t, f)
is

ˆPb

Thus
we
see
that

variant sharp-time QFT. We denote by PKG the energy-momentum opera-
tor of the sharp-time free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld:
PKG := (Hb, ˆPb,1, . . . , ˆPb,d).

Representation Theoretic Aspects
Theorem 10.1 implies in particular that, for each (t, f) ∈R × SR(Rd),
φ(t, f) and π(t, f) are essentially self-adjoint. We denote their closure by
φ(t, f) and π(t, f) respectively, which are self-adjoint. For each t ∈R, we
set
ρt := (Fb(L2(Rd)), {φ(t, f), π(t, f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}).
Theorem 10.5.
(i) For each t ∈R, ρt is an irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR
over SR(Rd).
(ii) For each pair (t, s) ∈R × R, ρt is equivalent to ρs.
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that ρ0 (the case t = 0) is an irreducible Weyl
representation of the CCR over SR(Rd). Let ˆCd : L2(Rd
k) →L2(Rd
k) be
deﬁned by
( ˆCd ˆf)(k) := ˆf(−k)∗,
ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k).
Then it is easy to see that ˆCd is a conjugation and Dd := { ˆf|f ∈SR(Rd)}
is a dense subspace of H ˆ
Cd := { ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k)| ˆCd ˆf = ˆf}. Obviously the
multiplication operator T := √ω is reduced by H ˆ
Cd. We have
φ(0, f) = φF(T −1 ˆf),
π(0, f) = πF(T ˆf).
Moreover, T Dd and T −1Dd are dense in H ˆ
Cd. Thus we can apply Theorem
5.44 to conclude that ρ0 is an irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR
over SR(Rd).
Theorem 10.2 implies that {eiφ(t,f), eiπ(t,f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} is unitarily
equivalent to {eiφ(0,f), eiπ(0,f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}. By this fact and Proposition
5.8, ρt is an irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR over SR(Rd) which
is equivalent to ρ0.
(ii) By the proof of (i), ρt ∼= ρ0 ∼= ρs (∼= means “equivalent”).
Remark 10.1. To make explicit the dependence of ρ0 on the mass m ≥0,
we write ρ(m) := ρ0. It is proved that, if m1 ̸= m2 (m1, m2 ≥0), then ρ(m1)
is inequivalent to ρ(m2) (see [Reed and Simon (1975), Theorem X.46] for the
case d = 3 and m1, m2 > 0 and [Arai (2016)] for the general case; in [Arai
(2016)], a general structure behind the fact is clariﬁed). Thus {ρ(m)}m≥0 is
a family of mutually inequivalent irreducible Weyl representations and the
boson masses form the index set of it. This is a very interesting fact which
clariﬁes a meaning of boson masses.

the quantum ﬁeld φ(t, f) is implementable by an anti-unitary involution.
We next consider the space-inversion for φ(t, f). Let us be deﬁned by
(9.31) and
ˆus := FdusF −1
d
.
Then it follows that
(ˆusf)(k) = f(−k),
f ∈L2(Rd
k),
a.e.k ∈Rd.
Since ˆus is a unitary involution, so is the operator
ˆUs := Γb(ˆus)
on Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
Theorem 10.7. For all t ∈R and f ∈H−1/2
ω

ˆUsφ(t, f) ˆU −1

Proof. Using ω(k) = ω(−k), k ∈Rd, we see that
eitωω−1/2Fd(usf) = ˆus(eitωω−1/2 ˆf),
eitωω−1/2Fd(usf)∗= ˆus(eitωω−1/2c
f ∗).
Hence (10.19) follows.
Formula (10.19) shows that the parity-transformed ﬁeld φ(t, usf) is uni-
tarily implementable by a unitary involution.
The operator
Upc := Γb(ˆus)Γb(ˆuc) = Γb(ˆusˆuc),
is an anti-unitary involution.
Theorems 10.6 and 10.7 immediately yield the following fact:
Theorem 10.8 (PCT theorem).
For all t ∈R and f ∈H−1/2
ω
(Rd),
Upcφ(t, f)U −1
pc = φ(−t, usucf).
(10.20)
Let Ω0 be the Fock vacuum in Fb(L2(Rd
k)):
Ω0 := {1, 0, 0, . . .}.
(10.21)
Then
UpcΩ0 = Ω0.
(10.22)
Corollary 10.1. Let fj ∈H−1/2
ω
(Rd), tj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N. Then
⟨Ω0, φ(t1, f1) · · · φ(tn, fn)Ω0⟩
= ⟨Ω0, φ(−tn, usfn) · · · φ(−t1, usf1)Ω0⟩.
Proof. By (9.28) and (10.20), we have
φ(t, f) = Upcφ(−t, (usf)∗)U −1
pc .
(10.23)
By (10.22) and the anti-unitarity of Upc, we have for all Ψ ∈Fb(L2(Rd
k))
⟨Ω0, Ψ⟩= ⟨UpcΨ, UpcΩ0⟩= ⟨UpcΨ, Ω0⟩.
Hence
⟨Ω0, φ(t1, f1) · · · φ(tn, fn)Ω0⟩
= ⟨φ(−t1, (usf1)∗) · · · φ(−tn, (usfn)∗)Ω0, Ω0⟩
= ⟨Ω0, φ(−tn, usfn) · · · φ(−t1, usf1)Ω0⟩,
where we have used the ﬁrst relation in (10.12).
Remark 10.2. In the framework of the G˚arding-Wightman axioms, PCT
theorem is proved to hold in general. See, e.g., [Streater and Wightman
(1964)] and [Reed and Simon (1975), §IX.8].

Similarly one can compute VEV’s for products of φ(·, ·) and π(·, ·) (Prob-
lem 3).

Energy-momentum Spectrum
As in the case of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld, one can identify
the spectrum of the Hamiltonian Hb of the free quantum KG ﬁeld as follows:
σ(Hb) = {0} ∪
 
∪∞
n=1
( n
X
l=1
ω(kl)|kl ∈Rd, l = 1, . . . , n
)!
= {0} ∪[m, ∞),
σp(Hb) = {0},
ker Hb = {αΩ0|α ∈C}.
Spectral properties of ˆPb,j are given by Theorem 9.6(ii). In the present
case, however, the energy-momentum spectrum, i.e., the joint spectrum of
PKG is not the direct product of σ(Hb), σ( ˆPb,1), . . ., σ( ˆPb,d−1) and σ( ˆPb,d)
as is shown below.
Since we use the physical unit system such that c = 1 and ℏ= 1, the
hyperbolic hypersurface Vm with mass m (see (1.52)) takes the form
Vm = {k ∈(M1+d)∗|k2 = m2, k0 ≥0},
where (M1+d)∗is the dual space of the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski
space-time M1+d and k2 := k2
0 −Pd
j=1 k2
j .
For a nonnegative number r ≥0, we introduce a subset V≥r of (M1+d)∗
as follows:
V≥r := {k = (k0, k) ∈(M1+d)∗|k0 ≥0, k2 ≥r2}.

It is obvious that Vm = V (1)

closed.
We note the following lemma:

Proof. Let n ≥2 and kn ∈V (n)

It is easy to see that
ω(k)ω(k′) −|k||k′| ≥m2,
k, k′ ∈Rd.
(10.25)
Using this inequality, we obtain
k2
n ≥(nm)2 ≥(2m)2
(n ≥2).
This means that V (n)

⊂V≥2m (n ≥2). Hence
V (2)

(10.26)
and
∪∞

(10.27)

We next prove the converse inclusion relation of (10.26). Let k ∈V≥2m.
The function f on Rd × Rd deﬁned by
f(k1, k2) := ω(k1)ω(k2) −k1 · k2 (k1, k2 ∈Rd)
is continuous and, by (10.25), f(Rd × Rd) = [m2, ∞).
We have k2 ≥
(2m)2 = 4m2. Hence there exist k1, k2 ∈Rd such that
k2 = 2f(k1, k2) + 2m2.
Putting ql := (ω(kl), kl), l = 1, 2 and q := q1 + q2, we have q2 = k2.
Hence there exists a Lorentz transformation Λ ∈L ↑
+ such that k = Λq =
Λq1 + Λq2. Since q1, q2 ∈V (1)
m
= Vm, there exist k′
1, k′
2 ∈Rd such that
Λql = (ω(k′
l), k′
l), l = 1, 2. Hence k = (ω(k′
1) + ω(k′
2), k′
1 + k′
2) ∈V (2)
m .
Therefore V (2)
m
⊃V≥2m.
By this result and (10.26), we obtain V (2)
m
= V≥2m. Then, by (10.27),
V (2)
m
= ∪∞
n=2V (n)
m . Thus (10.24) follows.
Theorem 10.9. The joint spectrum σJ(PKG) of PKG is identiﬁed as
follows:
σJ(PKG) = {0} ∪Vm ∪V≥2m.
(10.28)
In particular, in the massless case m = 0,
σJ(PKG) = V +,
(10.29)
where V+ is the forward light cone (see (8.36)).
Proof. In the same way as in the proof of Lemma 9.7, one can show that
σ(PKG) = {0} ∪

∪∞
n=1V (n)
m

.
By the preceding lemma, the right hand side is equal to that of (10.28).
In the case m = 0, we have V≥0 = V +. Hence (10.29) holds.
Theorem 10.9 shows that
σJ(PKG) ⊂V +
and σJ(PKG) is invarinat under proper Lorentz transformations.

Unitary Representation of the (1 + d)-dimensional
Proper Poincar´e Group on the Boson Fock Space
Fb(L2(Rd
k))
In this section we construct a strongly continuous unitary representation of
the (1 + d)-dimensional proper Poincar´e group P↑
+ (see Subsection 8.8.5)
on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
We deﬁne a mapping jm : Vm →Rd by
jm(k) := k,
k = (k0, k) ∈Vm.
The mapping jm is a homeomorphism.3
The family
Bm := {B ∩Vm|B ∈B1+d}
of subsets in Vm is a Borel ﬁeld in Vm. For each E ∈Bm, one can deﬁne
µm(E) ≥0 by
µm(E) :=
Z
jm(E)
1
ω(k)dk,
where µm(E) := ∞if the integral on the right hand side is divergent. For
example, µm(Vm) = ∞. It is easy to see that µm is a σ-ﬁnite measure on
the measurable space (Vm, Bm).
Recall that L ↑
+ denotes the (1 + d)-dimensional proper Lorentz group
(see Subsection 8.8.2). An important property of µm is stated in the next
lemma:
Lemma 10.2. The measure µm is L ↑
+-invariant, i.e., for all Λ ∈L ↑
+ and
E ∈Bm,
µm(E) = µm(ΛE),
(10.30)
where d ≥2 is assumed in the case m = 0.
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case m > 0. For each non-negative function
f ∈C∞
0 (0, ∞), we deﬁne a measure ρf on (R1+d, B1+d) by
ρf(B) := 2
Z
B
f(k2)χ(k)dk,
B ∈B1+d,
where χ is the characteristic function of V +, the closure of the forward
light cone. It is obvious that supp ρf ⊂V +. For any Λ ∈L ↑
+, (Λk)2 = k2
3A mapping f : X →Y from a topological space X to a topological space Y is
called a homeomorphism if it is continuous and bijective with the inverse mapping
f−1 : Y →X being continuous.
 

Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields

(k ∈M1+d) and det Λ = 1. Moreover V + is invariant under any proper
Lorentz transformation. Hence ρf(B) = ρf(ΛB), i.e., ρf is an L ↑
+-invariant
measure.
Let h : V+ →[0, ∞) × Rd
k be deﬁned by
h(k) := (k2, k),
k ∈V+.
Then h is a homeomorphism. The Jacobian D(h)/D(k) of h is easily com-
puted with the result
D(h)
D(k) = 2k0.
Hence, for any Borel set B ⊂V+, we have
ρf(B) =
Z
h(B)
f(y)
p
y + k2 dydk.
Now we take a non-negative function v ∈C∞
0 (R) satisfying
R
R v(y)dy =
1 and deﬁne
fn(y) := nv(n(y −m2)),
n ∈N, y ∈R.
Then fn ∈C∞
0 (0, ∞). It is easy to seee that fn(y)
S ′
−→δ(y −m2) (n →∞)
(see Example D.6 in Appendix D). Hence, for any g ∈S (R1+d),
Z
R1+d g(k)dρfn(k) = 2

Hence, taking the limit n →∞, we obtain

(10.31)
Let B = (a0, b0] × (a1, b1] × · · · × (ad, bd] (−∞< aµ < bµ < ∞) and
set E := B ∩Vm. Then there exists a sequence {gn}n∈N of functions in
C∞
0 (R1+d) such that ∪n∈Nsupp gn ⊂K for a bounded set K ⊂R1+d,
 

584

supn∈N supx∈R1+d |gn(x)| < ∞and gn(k) →χB(k) (n →∞)(a.e. k), where
χB is the characteristic function of B.4 By (10.31), we have
Z
Vm
gn(Λ−1k)dµm(k) =

gn(k)dµm(k).
Taking n →∞with application of the Lebesgue dominated convergence
theorem, we obtain
R
Vm χB(Λ−1k))dµm(k) =
R
Vm χB(k)dµm(k).
Hence
(10.30) holds. Since the Borel ﬁeld Bm is generated by sets of the form
just considered, it follows that, for all E ∈Bm, (10.30) holds.
We next show that (10.30) holds also in the case m = 0.
For this

Take n > (d −1)/2. Then

Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we obtain

Then, in the same way as in the case of m > 0, one can derive (10.30) with
m = 0.
4For example, apply Lemma 6.8 in [Kuroda (1980)] with u = χB.

Remark 10.3. The measure µm is heuristically or symbolically written as
dµm(k) = 2θ(k0)δ(k2 −m2)dk,
where θ(·) is the Heaviside function (Example D.4 in Appendix D) and
δ(k2 −m2) is the distribution discussed in Example D.3 in Appendix D:
δ(k2 −m2) =
1
2ω(k)(δ(k0 + ω(k)) + δ(k0 −ω(k)).
Note that k2−m2 = k2
0−ω(k)2. In the physics literature, this heuristic form
is used. Since the distribution kernel θ(k0)δ(k2 −m2) is formally Lorentz
invariant (by Proposition 8.4), one infers the µm is L ↑
+-invariant. Lemma
10.2 gives a mathematically rigorous formulation and a proof of this guess.
In what follows, we set
˜k := (ω(k), k),
k ∈Rd
and, for each Λ ∈L ↑
+, we deﬁne kΛ = (k1
Λ, . . . , kd
Λ) ∈Rd by
kj
Λ := (Λ−1˜k)j, j = 1, . . . , d.
Then, using the fact that (Λ−1˜k)2 = ˜k2 = m2 and (Λ−1˜k)0 ≥0 (by Propo-
sition 8.4), we have
ω(kΛ) = (Λ−1˜k)0.
Hence
Λ−1˜k = (ω(kΛ), kΛ).
For each (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+, we deﬁne a linear operator u(a, Λ) on L2(Rd
k) by
(u(a, Λ)f)(k) = eia˜k
s
ω(kΛ)
ω(k) f(kΛ).
(10.32)
Proposition 10.2. The set {u(a, Λ)|(a, Λ) ∈P↑
+} is a strongly continuous
unitary representation of P↑
+.
Proof. (i) Isometric property.
Let f ∈L2(Rd
k) and g(k) := k0|f(k)|2
(k = (k0, k) ∈R1+d). Then
∥u(a, Λ)f∥2 =
Z
Rd dkω(kΛ)
ω(k) |f(kΛ)|2dk =
Z
Vm
g(Λ−1k)dµm(k).
By Lemma 10.2, the right hand side is equal to
R
Vm g(k)dµm(k) =
R
Rd |f(k)|2dk. Hence u(a, Λ) is an isometry.
 

586
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) Group property and unitarity. For all (a1, Λ1), (a2, Λ2) ∈P↑
+ and
a.e.k ∈Rd,
(u(a1, Λ1)u(a2, Λ2)f)(k) = eia1˜k

f((kΛ1)Λ2).
It is easy to see that
Λ−1
2 Λ−1
1 ˜k = (ω((kΛ1)Λ2), (kΛ1)Λ2)
Note that Λ−1
2 Λ−1
1
= (Λ1Λ2)−1. Hence it follows that
(u(a1, Λ1)u(a2, Λ2)f)(k) = (u(a1 + Λ1a2, Λ1Λ2)f)(k)
= (u((a1, Λ1)(a2, Λ2))f)(k).
Therefore
u(a1, Λ1)u(a2, Λ2) = u((a1, Λ1)(a2, Λ2)).
This shows that the mapping u : P↑
+ ∋(a, Λ) 7→u(a, Λ) is a representation
of P↑
+. In particular, taking (a2, Λ2) = (a1, Λ1)−1, we have
u(a1, Λ1)u((a1, Λ1)−1) = I.
Hence u(a1, Λ1) is bijective. Thus u(a, Λ) is unitary.
(iii) Strong continuity. Let (an, Λn), (a, Λ) ∈P↑

(n →∞). Then, for all f, g ∈C∞

⟨f, u(an, Λn)g⟩=

Following the method given in Section 4.10, we consider

resentation of P↑

(ii) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
Ub(a, Λ)Ω0 = Ω0.
(iii) If, for some α ∈C and all t ∈R, Ub((t, 0), I)Ψ = αΨ, then Ψ = z0Ω0
with a constant z0.
Proof. (i) This follows from Corollary 4.3.
(ii) This follows from the deﬁnition of Γb(·).
(iii) The present assumption and (10.34) imply that, for all t ∈R,
eitHbΨ = αΨ.
This implies that eitHbΨ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t,
Ψ ∈D(Hb) and HbΨ = 0. Since ker Hb = {zΩ0|z ∈C}, there exists a
constant z0 ∈C such that Ψ = z0Ω0.

A Free Neutral Quantum KG Field Smeared over the
Space-time
Following the prescription for construction of a totally smeared quantum
ﬁeld from a sharp-time one (see Subsection 8.3.3), we can construct a free
neutral quantum KG ﬁeld as an operator-valued distribution on R1+d
x
=
{x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd)|xµ ∈R, µ = 0, . . . , d}. Formally semearing φ(x) given
by (10.6) with f ∈S (R1+d

), we see that the following operator may be a
candidate for the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld:

To see that (10.35) is well deﬁned, we have to prove that Ff #/√ω ∈

Lemma 10.3. For all f ∈S (R1+d

have

k ∈Rd

(10.38)
Since ˆf ∈S (R1+d

such that

One can take n > (d −1)/2 so that

Ff/√ω ∈L2(Rd

Since f ∗∈S (R1+d
x
), we conclude that Ff ∗/√ω ∈
L2(Rd
k). Thus φ(f) is well deﬁned as an operator acting in Fb(L2(Rd

Remark 10.4. The operator φ(f) can be deﬁned also for all f ∈L1(R1+d

such that Ff/√ω, Ff ∗/√ω ∈L2(Rd

where F1+d : L2(R1+d

Lemma 10.5. The mapping φ : S (R1+d
x
) ∋f 7→φ(f) ∈L(Fb(L2(Rd

an operator-valued distribution with common domain D(N 1/2

Proof. Since D(N 1/2

) ⊂D(a(f)) ∩D(a(f)∗), f ∈L2(Rd
k), we have
D(φ(f)) ∩D(φ(f)∗) ⊃D(N 1/2
b
).
It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), φ(f)Ψ is linear in f ∈S (R1+d
x
).
By the N 1/2

This estimate and Lemma 10.4 imply that φ(f)Ψ is strongly continuous in
f in the topology of S (R1+d
x
). In particular, the mapping:f 7→φ(f) is an
operator-valued distribution on R1+d
x
with common domain D(N 1/2
b
).
Lemma 10.6 (invariant subspace and essential self-adjointness).
(i) For all f ∈S (R1+d
x

(ii) For

(ii) Let ΦS(·) be the Segal ﬁeld operator on Fb(L2(Rd

), we have
φ(f) =

(10.40)
on Fb,0(L2(Rd

Fb,0(L2(Rd

Lemma 10.7 (ﬁeld equation).
For all f ∈S (R1+d
x
) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

),
φ((□+ m2)f)Ψ = 0.
(10.41)
Proof. We have
(F1+d(□+ m2)f)(k) = (−k2
0 + k2 + m2) ˆf(k).
Using (10.38) and the fact that −ω(k)2 + k2 + m2 = 0, we obtain F(□+
m2)f = 0. Hence (10.41) holds.

In terms of the distribution kernel φ(x) of φ(f) (f ∈S (R1+d
x
)), (10.41)
is written
(□+ m2)φ(x)Ψ = 0,
i.e., φ(x) obeys the free KG equation in the sense of operator-valued dis-
tribution. By this fact and Lemma 10.6, we call the operator-valued distri-
bution φ a free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld.
As is expected, the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld φ has Poincar´e co-
variance:
Lemma 10.8 (Poincar´e covariance). For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈
S (R1+d
x
),
Ub(a, Λ)φ(f)Ub(a, Λ)−1 = φ(f(a,Λ)),
where f(a,Λ) is deﬁned by (8.32).
Proof. By (10.33) and (10.35), we have
Ub(a, Λ)φ(f)Ub(a, Λ)−1 = √π

Thus the desired result follows.
The results obtained so far on the quantum ﬁeld φ show that the
quadruple (Fb(L2(Rd
k)), Ub, φ, Fb,0(L2(Rd
k))) satisﬁes (GW.1)–(GW.3) in
the G˚arding-Wightman axioms with the vacuum being the Fock vacuum
Ω0. In separate sections below, we show that (GW.4) and (GW.5) in the
G˚arding-Wightman axioms also hold in the present model.
10.9
Cyclicity of the Fock Vacuum
For all n ∈N and fj ∈S (R1+d
x
), j = 1, . . . , n, the Fock vacuum Ω0 ∈
Fb(L2(Rd
k)) is in D(φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)). Hence the subspace
Dfree := span {Ω0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ω0|n ∈N, fj ∈S (R1+d
x
), j = 1, . . . , n}
is deﬁned. Obviously, for all f ∈S (R1+d
x
), φ(f) leaves Dfree invariant. One
has the following fact:
Theorem 10.11 (cyclicity).
The subspace Dfree is dense in Fb(L2(Rd
k)).

To prove this theorem, we need a lemma. Let
DKG := {Ff/√ω|f ∈S (R1+d)}
and
DKG,0 := span
v(ω)u

v ∈C∞

where v(ω)u is a function on Rd

k. For all v ∈C∞
0 (R) and u ∈C∞
0 (Rd
k), ˆv × ˇu ∈S (R1+d) and F ˆv × ˇu =
v(ω)u. Hence
DKG,0 ⊂DKG.
(10.42)
Lemma 10.9. The subspace DKG,0 is dense in L2(Rd
k).
Proof. Let g ∈D⊥
KG,0. Then, for any v ∈C∞
0 (R) and u ∈C∞
0 (Rd
k),
Z
Rd G(k)u(k)dk = 0,
where G(k) := g(k)∗v(ω(k)/
p
ω(k). Since supp G is bounded, it follows
from the Schwarz inequality that G is locally integrable (i.e., G ∈L1
loc(Rd
k)),
where, in the case m = 0, we use the condition d ≥2. Hence, by the lemma
of du Bois-Reymond (the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations),
G = 0. Since v ∈C∞
0 (R) is arbitrary, it follows that g = 0. Therefore
D⊥
KG,0 = {0}. Thus DKG,0 is dense in L2(Rd
k).
From this lemma and (10.42), the following fact is derived:
Lemma 10.10. The subspace DKG is dense in L2(Rd
k).
We are now ready to prove Theorem 10.11.
Proof of Theorem 10.11
A function f ∈S (R1+d) is written as f = f1 + if2, where f1 (resp. f2)
is the real (resp. imaginary) part of f. Hence φ(f) = φ(f1) + iφ(f2) on
D(N 1/2
b
). Therefore
Dfree = span {Ω0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ω0|n ∈N, fj ∈SR(R1+d
x
), j = 1, . . . , n}.
By this fact and (10.40), we have
Dfree = span {Ω0, ΦS(F1) · · · ΦS(Fn)Ω0|n ∈N, Fj ∈DKG, j = 1, . . . , n}.
By Lemma 10.10, DKG is dense in L2(Rd
k). Hence, by Proposition 5.14(iii),
Dfree is dense in Fb(L2(Rd
k)).

Theorem 10.11 shows that (GW.5) holds in the present model.

Commutation Relations and Microscopic Causality
In this section, we prove that, in the case of the 4-dimensional space-time
(d = 3), the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld φ satisﬁes the microscopic
causality (GW.4) in the G˚arding-Wightman axioms. In this way, it is shown
that the present model with d = 3 satisﬁes all of the G˚arding-Wightman
axioms. In fact, this holds in any dimensional space-time (d ≥2 in the
massless case m = 0). We will touch on this point in the next section.
10.10.1
Commutation relations
Let f, g ∈S (R1+d
x
). Then, by (10.35) and the CCR of a(·)#, we have the
following commutation relation on Fb,0(L2(Rd

[φ(f), φ(g)] = i[D+(f, g) −D+(g, f)],

By Lemma 10.4, the mapping: S (R1+d
x
)×S (R1+d
x
) ∋(f, g) 7→D+(f, g)
is separately continuous. Hence, by the Schwartz nuclear theorem (Theorem
D.5 in Appendix D), there exists a unique tempered distribution eD+ ∈
S ′(R2(1+d)) such that
eD+(f × g) = D+(f, g),
f, g ∈S (R1+d
x
),
where (f × g)(x, y) := f(x)g(y), x, y ∈R1+d. We denote by eD+(x, y) the
distribution kernel of eD+:
eD+(G) =
Z
R1+d×R1+d
eD+(x, y)G(x, y)dxdy,
G ∈S (R2(1+d)).
Lemma 10.11. The tempered distribution eD+ is R1+d-translation invari-
ant, i.e., for all a ∈R1+d, eD+(x + a, y + a) = eD+(x, y) in the sense of
distribution.
Proof. Let f, g ∈S (R1+d
x
) and fa(x) := f(x −a), x ∈R1+d. Then it
is easy to see that D+(fa, ga) = D+(f, g). Hence eD+(U1+d(a)(f × g)) =
eD+(f × g), where
(U1+d(a)G)(x, y) := G(x −a, y −a),
x, y ∈R1+d.
Hence, by Corollary D.1, eD+(U1+d(a)G) = eD+(G) for all G ∈S (R2(1+d)),
This implie the desired result.
By Lemma 10.11 and Theorem D.3, there exists a unique tempered
distribution ∆+ ∈S ′(R1+d) such that
eD+(x, y) = ∆+(x −y)
(10.46)
in the sense of distribution, i.e., for all G ∈S (R2(1+d)),
eD+(G) = ∆+(I(G)),
where I(G)(x) :=
R
Rd G(x + y, y)dy, x ∈R1+d. In particular, for all f, g ∈
S (R1+d),
D+(f, g) = (∆+ ∗g)(f),
where ∗denotes convolution (see Subsection D.9.2 in Appendix D).
By Theorem D.7(i) in Appendix D, ∆+ ∗g is a polynomially bounded
C∞-function on R1+d satisfying (∆+ ∗g)(x) = ∆+(˜gx), where ˜gx(y) :=
g(x −y), x, y ∈R1+d. Hence it follows that
D+(f, g) =
Z
R1+d ∆+(˜gx)f(x)dx.

Comparing this with (10.44), we obtain

In particular, letting x = 0 and using the surjectivity of the mapping

∆+(f) = −

∆+(f) = lim
κ→∞∆+,κ(f),
f ∈S (R1+d),
(10.48)
i.e., ∆+,κ
S ′
→∆+ (κ →∞).
We deﬁne a tempered distribution ∆∈S ′(R1+d) by
∆(f) := ∆+(f) −∆+( ˜f),
f ∈S (R1+d),
where ˜f(x) := f(−x), x ∈R1+d. In terms of distribution kernels,
∆(x) = ∆+(x) −∆+(−x).
(10.49)
The tempered distribution ∆is called the Pauli-Jordan distribution. In
terms of this distribution, (10.43) takes the form
[φ(f), φ(g)] = i(∆∗g)(f),
f, g ∈S (R1+d),
(10.50)
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
For a function f on R1+d, the function fs on R1+d deﬁned by
(fs)(t, x) := f(t, −x),
t ∈R, x ∈Rd
is called the space-inversion of f.
A tempered distribution ψ ∈S ′(R1+d) is said to be space-inversion
invariant if ψ(fs) = ψ(f) for all f ∈S (R1+d).
In terms of the dis-
tribution kernel ψ(t, x), the space-inversion invariance of ψ is written
ψ(t, x) = ψ(t, −x).
Proposition 10.3. The distribution ∆+ obeys the KG equation:
∆+((□+ m2)f) = 0,
f ∈S (R1+d).
(10.51)
Moreover ∆+ is Lorentz and space-inversion invariant.
 

Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
595
Proof. Let g = (□+ m2)f. Then
ˆg(ω(k), k) = (−ω(k)2 + k2 + m2) ˆf(ω(k), k) = 0.
Hence, by (10.47), ∆+(g) = 0. Thus (10.51) holds.
Let Λ ∈L ↑
+. Then we have
\
f(0,Λ)(ω(k), −k) = ˆf(ω(kΛ), −kΛ),
f ∈S (R1+d), k ∈Rd.
Hence, by (10.47) and Lemma 10.2,
∆+(f(0,Λ)) = ∆+(f).
Therefore ∆+ is Lorentz invariant.
For all f ∈S (R1+d), we have
bfs(ω(k), −k) = f(ω(k), k).
Hence, by (10.47), ∆+(fs) = ∆+(f).
The next corollary immediately follows from the deﬁnition of the Pauli-
Jordan distribution ∆and Proposition 10.3:
Corollary 10.2. The Pauli-Jordan distribution ∆obeys the KG equation:
∆((□+ m2)f) = 0,
f ∈S (R1+d).
(10.52)
Moreover ∆is Lorentz and space-inversion invariant.
10.10.2
The Pauli-Jordan distribution in the 4-dimensional
space-time
The Pauli-Jordan distribution ∆can be computed in terms of special distri-
butions in any space-time dimension 1 + d ( d ≥2 in the case m = 0). But,
for simplicity and instructive reasons, we ﬁrst compute ∆in the physical
case d = 3. For this purpose, we need only to compute ∆+. By (10.48), the
problem is reduced to analysis of the limit limκ→∞∆+,κ(x) in S ′(R1+d).
Let d = 3. Then, using the polar coordinate of R3
k = {(k1, k2, k3)|kj ∈
R, j = 1, 2, 3}
k1 = k sin θ cos φ, k2 = k sin θ sin φ, k3 = k cos θ,
k > 0, θ ∈[0, π), φ ∈[0, 2π), we have
∆+,κ(x) =

4π|x|δ(|x| −t)
in S ′(R4), where δ(|x| −t)/|x| is an example of the tempered distribution
considered in Subsection D.3.3. Therefore we obtain
∆+(x) = −
1
4π|x|δ(|x| −t)
(10.54)
in the sense of distribution. Hence
∆+(−x) = −

4π|x|δ(|x| + t).
Therefore
∆(x) = −

4π|x|(δ(|x| −t) −δ(|x| + t)) = −1

(10.55)

∆+,κ(t, x) =

(10.56)
where ∂r := ∂/∂r.

Proof. The integrand F(k, t, r)

k2 + m2 and
|∂rF(k, t, r)| =

which is integrable with respect to k on the interval [−κ, κ] and independent
of r. Hence, Vκ(t, r) is partially diﬀerentiable in r and

By this fact and (10.53), we obtain (10.56).
Let us compute limκ→∞Vκ. The result is as follows:

We set

In the present case, t/ρ > 1. Hence there exists a unique number α > 0

(2) The case t < −r
In this case, −t/ρ > 1. Hence there exists a unique number α > 0 such
that cosh α = −t/ρ. Then sinh α = r/ρ. Hence, in the same manner as in

We set
η :=

r2 −t2.
We ﬁrst consider the case 0 < t < r. In this case r/η > 1. Hence there
exists a number α > 0 such that cosh α = r/η. Then sinh α = t/η. Hence
Vκ(t, r) =

where we have used a formula for K0(x) (x > 0) (see, e.g., [Moriguti et al.
(1960), p.188]). Hence the third equation in (10.57) is obtained. Similarly
one can derive the same result in the case 0 < −t < r.
Lemma 10.14. There exist positive constants C1 and C2 such that, for all
suﬃciently large κ > 0,
|Vκ(t, r)| ≤C1 +

Proof. We give a proof only in the case t > r. The other cases on (t, r)

Sharp-time Distributions and Feynman Propagator
As is easily seen, the function ∆+,κ is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable on R1+d with
all the partial derivatives being bounded on R1+d. Hence, in particular, for
each t ∈R, ∆+,κ(t, ·) can be regarded as a tempered distribution on Rd
(see Subsection D.3.2 in Appendix D). Its form smeared with u ∈S (Rd)
is written ∆+,κ(t, u):
∆+,κ(t, u) :=
1
2(2π)d/2i
Z
|k|≤κ
e−iω(k)tˇu(k)
ω(k)

where ˇu denotes the inverse Fourier transform of u.
It is easy to see that the mapping ∆+(t, ·) : S (Rd) →C deﬁned by
∆+(t, u) :=
1
2(2π)d/2i
Z
Rd
e−iω(k)tˇu(k)
ω(k)
dk, u ∈S (Rd),
is a tempered distribution on Rd. Since |ˇu|/ω is integrable on Rd (recall
that, in the case m = 0, d ≥2 is assumed), it follows that
lim
κ→∞∆+,κ(t, u) = ∆+(t, u),
t ∈R, u ∈S (Rd).
For all v ∈S (R) and u ∈S (Rd), one has
∆+(v × u) =
Z
R
v(t)∆+(t, u)dt.
Hence ∆+(t, ·) is the sharp-time version of ∆+.
For each t ∈R, we deﬁne a tempered distribution ∆F(t, ·) on Rd by
∆F(t, u) := θ(t)∆+(t, u) + θ(−t)∆+(−t, ˜u),
where θ(·) is the Heaviside function (see Example D.4 in Appendix D) and
˜u(x) := u(−x), x ∈Rd. It is easy to see that the mapping:

The distribution ∆F is called the Feynman propagator for the free quan-
tum KG ﬁeld. In terms of distribution kernels, we have
∆F(x) = θ(x0)∆+(x) + θ(−x0)∆+(−x).
(10.64)
Using the fact that
∆+(x)∗= −∆+(−x)
in the distribution sense and the identity
θ(x0) + θ(−x0) = 1,
x0 ∈R \ {0},
we obtain
∆+(x) = θ(x0)∆F(x) −θ(−x0)∆F(x)∗.
(10.65)
This is a formula representing ∆+ in terms of ∆F.
We outline how to ﬁnd an explicit form of ∆F. Using the residue theo-

D.
This means that ∆F is the inverse Fourier transform of (2π)−(1+d)/2(k2−

∆F =

(2π)(1+d)/2 F −1

where kx is the Minkowski inner product of k and x (the change of variable

(□+ m2)∆F(x −y) = −δ(x −y),
(10.68)
in the sense of distribution, i.e., −∆F is a fundamental solution for the free
KG equation.
Formula (10.67) shows also that ∆F is a Lorentz invariant distribution.
The (inverse) Fourier transform of tempered distributions of the form
(P(k) ± i0)−1 (P(k) is a quadratic form of k) is known (e.g., [Gel’fand and
Shilov (1964), Chapter 3, §2.8]). Here we cite only a result (apply [Gel’fand
and Shilov (1964), p. 290, Eq.(11)])

Remark 10.5. Formula (10.69) (resp. (10.70) gives an identiﬁcation of
the distribution kernel ∆F(x) (resp. ∆+(x)) with a function in the region
x2 ̸= 0. But, as a distribution, ∆F has a singularity on the set x2 = 0
which is represented as a linear combination of δ(x2) and its derivatives.
A similar remark applies to ∆+ too (see, e.g., [Gel’fand and Shilov (1964),
Chapter 3, §2.2]).

In particular, we have

Hence the support of ∆is outside of the space-like region:
supp ∆⊂{x ∈M1+d|x2 ≥0}.
By this fact and (10.50), we obtain the following result:
Theorem 10.14 (microscopic causality). Let f, g ∈S (R1+d) be such
that supp f is space-like separated from supp g. Then
[φ(f), φ(g)] = 0
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
The results obtained so far are summarized as follows:
Theorem 10.15. The quintuple (Fb(L2(Rd
k)), Ub, φ, Dfree, Ω0) is a neutral
quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on M1+d in the sense of the G˚arding-Wightman
axioms. The vacuum of the theory is given by the Fock vacuum Ω0.
10.13
Vacuum Expectation Values
Since we have shown that (Fb(L2(Rd
k), Ub, φ, Dfree, Ω0) satisﬁes the
G˚arding-Wightman axioms, we can apply results in the general theory of
QFT in Chapter 8. In particular, for each n ∈N, there exists a unique
tempered distribution W free
n
∈S ′(R(1+d)n) such that
W free
n
(f1 × · · · × fn) = ⟨Ω0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ω0⟩,
fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n.
The tempered distribution W free
n
is called the n-point Wightman distri-
bution for the neutral free quantum KG ﬁeld.
It is easy to see that
W free
2
(f1, f2) = iD+(f1, f2).
Hence it follows from (10.40) and Theorem 5.32 that, for all n ∈N and
fj ∈SR(R1+d) (j = 1, 2, . . .),
W free

By the linearity of Wn(f1 × · · · × fn) in each fj, (10.71) and (10.72) can be
extended to all fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, 2, . . . . In terms of distribution kernels,
(10.71) and (10.72) are written as follows:
W free

by

(x, y) + θ(y0 −x0)W free
2
(y, x)
in the sense of distribution.
In the physics literature, G2 is called the
causal Green function, although it is not a function globally. It follows
from (10.75) and (10.64) that
G2(x, y) = i∆F(x −y).
(10.76)
This gives a physical meaning of Feynman’s propagator ∆F.
10.14
Quantum Field with Momentum Cutoﬀ
For each x ∈Rd and a constant κ > 0, we deﬁne a function gκ,x on Rd
k by
gκ,x(k) := e−ik·xχκ(k)
p
(2π)dω(k)
,
k ∈Rd
k,
where
χκ(k) :=
 1 for |k| ≤κ
0 for |k| > κ .
(10.77)
It is easy to see that gκ,xe±iωt is in L2(Rd
k). Hence we can deﬁne a self-
adjoint operator
φκ(t, x) := ΦS(gκ,xeiωt) =
1
√

(10.78)
The correspondence: (t, x) 7→φκ(t, x) gives an operator-valued function on
R1+d.
Proposition 10.4. For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), φκ(t, x)Ψ is inﬁnitely strongly
diﬀerentiable in t, x and satisﬁes the free KG equation:
(□+ m2)φκ(t, x)Ψ = 0.
(10.79)
 

606
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. For each k ∈Rd,
(□+ m2)gκ,x(k)eiω(k)t = 0.
Using this property, one can prove (10.79) in the same way as in the proof
of Theorem 10.3.
The operator-valued function φκ(t, x) is called the free quantum KG
ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀκ.
This notion of quantum ﬁeld comes from the symbolical expression
(10.6) of the kernel φ(x) of the free quantum KG ﬁeld φ.
Indeed, by
restricting the integral with respect to dk in (10.6) to the bounded set
{k ∈Rd| |k| ≤κ}, one obtains a well-deﬁned expression which is just the
right hand side of (10.78).
A momentum cutoﬀκ is also called an ultraviolet cutoﬀ, since a
region of large |k| physically corresponds to an optical region of ultraviolet
rays.
Each space-rotation R ∈SO(d) yields a proper Lorentz transformation

Proposition 10.5. The quantum ﬁeld φκ(t, x) is translation and space-
rotation covariant, i.e., for all a ∈R1+d and R ∈SO(d),
Ub(a, ˆR)φκ(x)Ub(a, ˆR)−1 = φκ( ˆRx + a),
x = (t, x) ∈R1+d.

We have R−1k = k ˆ
R. Therefore |k ˆ
R| = |k|. Using these properties, we
obtain
u(a, ˆR)gκ,xeiωt = gκ,Rx+aeiω(t+a0), a = (a0, a).
Hence the desired result follows.

A cost for introducing the momentum cutoﬀκ for φ(x) is the violation
of Lorentz covariance:

Λ(θ) =

,
where Id−2 is the (d −2) × (d −2) unit matrix. Let (y0, y) := Λ(θ)x. Then
(u(0, Λ(θ))gκ,xeiωt)(k) = ei˜kΛ(θ)xχκ(kΛ(θ))
p
(2π)dω(k)
,
(gκ,yeiωy0)(k) = ei˜kΛ(θ)xχκ(k)
p
(2π)dω(k)
.
Note that Λ(θ)−1 = Λ(−θ). Hence
kΛ(θ) = (ω(k) sinh θ + k1 cosh θ, k2, . . . , kd),
Using this form, one can show that there exists a θ > 0 such that χκ ̸= χκ,θ
where χκ,θ(k) := χκ(kΛ(θ)), k ∈Rd. Hence
u(0, Λ(θ))gκ,xeiωt ̸= gκ,yeiωy0.
Thus Ub(0, Λ(θ))φκ(x)Ub(0, Λ(θ))−1 ̸= φκ(Λ(θ)x).
For all f ∈L1(Rd),
Z
Rd ∥f(x)gκ,x∥L2(Rd

Hence the L2(Rd

Iκ(f) :=
Z
Rd f(x)gκ,xdx
exists (see Appendix E).
It is easy to see that the L2(Rd
k)-valued
function:x 7→gκ,x is strongly continuous on Rd
x. Hence, if f ∈L1(Rd) ∩
C(Rd), then Iκ(f) is also the strong Riemann integral of f(x)gκ,x.

Iκ(f) = χκ ˆf

Lemma 10.16. Let f ∈L1(Rd) be such that ˆf/√ω ∈L2(Rd

Then,

It is easy to see that one can apply the Lebesgue dominated convergence
to the integral on the right hand side to obtain

Z
Rd(1 −χκ(k))2 | ˆf(k)|2
ω(k) dk = 0.
Thus the desired result follows.
Let Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

Hence the Bochner integrals

and
Aκ,+(t, f)Ψ :=

exist. We regard the symbols Aκ,±(t, f)# as the linear operators with do-
main D(N 1/2

) ∋Ψ 7→Aκ,±(t, f)Ψ.
As in the case of Iκ(f), if f
∈L1(Rd) ∩C1(Rd), then Aκ,±(t, f)Ψ
are also taken in the sense of strong Riemann integral, because the
mapping:L2(Rd
k) ∋u 7→a(u)#Ψ is strongly continuous.
It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), the Bochner integral
φκ(t, f)Ψ :=
Z
Rd φκ(t, x)f(x)Ψ dx
exists and
φκ(t, f) =

Theorem 10.16. Let f ∈L1(Rd) ∩C1(Rd) such that ˆf/√ω ∈L2(Rd

Then, for all t ∈R and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
),
lim
κ→∞∥φκ(t, f)Ψ −φ(t, f)Ψ∥= 0,
where φ(t, ·) is the sharp-time free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld.
Proof. By the strong continuity of the mapping:L2(Rd
k) ∋u 7→a(u)#Ψ,
we have
Aκ,+(t, f)Ψ = a(Iκ(f)eiωt)∗Ψ,
Aκ,−(t, f)Ψ = a(Iκ(f ∗)eiωt)Ψ.
Hence

By Lemma 10.16, the right hand side converges to 0 as κ →∞.

Theorem 10.16 shows that the sharp-time smeared free KG ﬁeld φκ(t, f)
with momentum cutoﬀκ strongly converges to the sharp-time free KG ﬁeld
φ(t, f) on D(N 1/2
b
) in the limit κ →∞of removing the momentum cutoﬀ
κ. In this sense, φκ(t, f) gives an approximate form of φ(t, f). But φκ(t, x)
itself does not converge as the following example shows:

∥φκ(t, x)Ω0∥2 =

|k|≤κ

Since
R
Rd ω(k)−1dk = ∞, we have
lim
κ→∞∥φκ(t, x)Ω0∥2 = ∞.
This implies that limκ→∞φκ(t, x)Ω0 does not exist.
Remark 10.6. The divergence seen in the above example is an elementary
example of the so-called ultraviolet divergences in QFT. This kind of
divergence comes from treating a mathematically meaningless object such
as φ(x)n (n ≥2) which is used to “deﬁne” an interaction of a quantum ﬁeld
at the space-time point x. The problem of ultraviolet divergences in QFT is
not yet solved mathematically with full generality, although algorithms to
obtain ﬁnite results in QFT models in terms of formal perturbation theory
have been established as “renormalization theory”. To construct in a non-
perturbative way a non-trivial model of relativistic QFT without ultraviolet
cutoﬀs in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time is still one of the most
important issues in modern mathematical physics.
10.15
Schwinger Functions
Since we have seen that the free neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory
(Fb(L2(Rd
k), Ub, φ, Dfree, Ω0) satisﬁes the G˚arding-Wightman axioms, it
follows from the general theory given in Chapter 8 that it satisﬁes also
the Wightman axioms and the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms. It may be
interesting to compute explicitly the Schwinger functions of the model.
By (10.73) and (10.74), it is suﬃcient to compute the two-point
Schwinger function.
Taking (10.75) into account, we deﬁne a function
W(z, x) (z ∈C \ R, x ∈Rd) as follows:
W(z, x) :=

Lemma 10.17. For each x ∈Rd, W(z, x) is analytic in z on C \ R and
lim
ε↓0 W(t −iε, x) = i∆+(t, x),
(10.81)
lim
ε↓0 W(t + iε, x) = i∆+(−t, x)
(10.82)
in S ′(R1+d).
Proof. Let Im z > 0. Then W(z, x) =
R
Rd fx(z, k)dk with fx(z, k) :=
eiω(k)z+ik·x/2(2π)dω(k). It is obvious that fx(z, k) is diﬀerentiable in z
and, for all z ∈C satisfying Im z ≥δ > 0, where δ > 0 is an arbitrary
constant,

∂fx(z, k)
∂z
 =
1
2(2π)d e−ω(k)Im z ≤
1
2(2π)d e−ω(k)δ
and
R
Rd e−ω(k)δdk < ∞.
Hence, by a general theorem on Lebesgue in-
tegration, W(z, x) is diﬀerentiable in z on the region {z ∈C|Im z > δ}
and
∂W(z, x)
∂z

Since δ > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that W(z, x) is analytic in z on {z ∈
C|Im z > 0}. Similarly one can show that the analyticity of W(z, x) in z
on {z ∈C|Im z < 0}.
Let f ∈S (R1+d) and ε > 0. Then
Z
R1+d W(t −iε, x)f(t, x)dtdx =
π
(2π)(1+d)/2
Z

Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we have

Thus (10.81) holds. Similarly (10.82) is proved.
Remark 10.7. It holds also that, for all u ∈S (Rd),

The reader is asked to prove this formula (Problem 10).

Lemma 10.17 shows that W(z1 −z2, x1 −x2) is an analytic continu-
ation of the two-point Wightman distribution W free

{((z1, x1), (z2, x2)) ∈C1+d × C1+d|Im (z1 −z2) < 0, x1, x2 ∈Rd} and

call that ∆+ is space-inversion invariant). Hence the two-point Schwinger

follows:
Sfree

W(−i(y0 −x0), y −x) for x0 < y0 .

and
S(x) := W(−ix0, x),

(10.84)
Then we have
Sfree
2
(x, y) = θ(x0 −y0)S(x −y) + θ(y0 −x0)S(y −x).

S(x) =

10.16
Charged Quantum Scalar Field
In this section, we describe an outline of a method to construct a quantum
ﬁeld version of a complex-valued classical ﬁeld φcl satisfying the free KG
equation (10.1).

by

,
(10.86)
where acl
± are functions with suitable properties. Note that, in contrast to
the case of the real scalar ﬁeld, two independent functions acl
± appear here.
To obtain a quantum version of the complex ﬁeld φcl, one needs only to
replace the functions acl
± by operator-valued distributions a±(k) satisfying
the CCR
[a±(k), a±(k′)∗] = δ(k −k′),
[a±(k), a±(k′)] = 0,
[a+(k), a−(k′)∗] = 0,
[a+(k), a−(k′)] = 0.
Hence two kinds of annihilation operators a±(k) are needed. Therefore a
quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical ﬁeld φcl is supposed to describe
two kinds of elementary particles.
It turns out that these two kinds of
elementary particles are interpreted as charged particles which have the
same mass, but, a diﬀerent sign of charge.6
As is well known, to each
elementary particle, there corresponds an elementary particle, called the
anti-particle of it, which has the same mass, the same spin and the same life
time, but, a diﬀerent sign as for electromagnetic properties. Therefore the
quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the complex classical ﬁeld φcl is interpreted
to describe a charged particle and its anti-particle with spin 0.
Let H+ be a Hilbert space of state vectors of a charged particle with spin
0 and H−be that of the anti-particle of it. From a quantum ﬁeld theoretical
point of view, a particle and an anti-particle of it are not separated, but,
two appearances of one entity. This one entity is nothing but a pair of a
particle and an anti-particle. Hence it is natural to take the direct sum
Hilbert space
H1 = H+ ⊕H−
as a one-particle Hilbert space of the quantum ﬁeld to be constructed. Then
it is expected that the theory of the boson Fock space Fb(H1) over H1 can
be used to construct the desired quantum ﬁeld theory.
6For detailed physical discussions, see, e.g., [Bjorken and Drell (1965), §12.5].

10.16.2
Outline of a mathematically rigorous construction
Based on the heuristic arguments in the preceding subsection, we now give
an outline of a mathematically rigorous construction of a charged quantum
scalar ﬁeld.
(1) Creation and annihilation operators
The choice of the Hilbert spaces H+ and H−may be arbitrary in an ab-
stract level. But, to be parallel to the theory of the free neutral quantum
KG ﬁeld, we take H± = L2(Rd
k) so that
H1 = L2(Rd
k) ⊕L2(Rd
k) = {(f, g)|f, g ∈L2(Rd
k)}.
We denote by a(f, g) the annihilation operator on the boson Fock space
Fb(H1) with test vector (f, g) ∈H1. This operator yields two operators:
a+(f) := a(f, 0),
a−(f) := a(0, f),
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
We call a+(f) (resp. a−(f)) the annihilation operator of the parti-
cle (resp. anti-particle) with test vector f. The adjoint a+(f)∗(resp.
a−(f)∗) is called the creation operator of the particle (resp. anti-
particle) with test vector f. As is easily seen, the following commutation
relations hold on Fb,0(H1): for all f, g ∈L2(Rd
k),
[a±(f), a±(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩,
[a±(f), a±(g)] = 0,
(10.87)
[a+(f), a−(g)] = 0,
, [a+(f), a−(g)∗] = 0.
(10.88)
We denote by Nb the number operator on Hb(H1).
(2) A free charged quantum scalar ﬁeld
The heuristic arguments in the preceding subsection suggest one to deﬁne
a quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical ﬁeld φcl by
φcp(f) := √π

, f ∈S (R1+d),
where the subscript “cp” means “charged particle”. In the same way as in
the case of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld, one can show that
φcp((□+ m2)f) = 0
on D(N 1/2
b
), i.e., φcp satisﬁes the free KG equation in the sense of operator-
valued distribution. We call φcp a free charged quantum scalar ﬁeld.
 

616
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Commutation relations (10.87) and (10.88) imply the following com-
mutation relations of the free charged quantum scalar ﬁeld: for all f, g ∈
S (R1+d),
[φcp(f), φcp(g)∗] = i
Z
R1+d f(x)(∆∗g∗)(x)dx,
[φcp(f), φcp(g)] = 0,
[φcp(f)∗, φcp(g)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(H1). In particular, if supp f is space-like separated from supp g,
then [φcp(f), φcp(g)∗] = 0 on Fb,0(H1). This is the microscopic causality
in the present model.
(3) Sharp-time quantum ﬁelds
The sharp-time quantum ﬁeld of φcp(f) is deﬁned by
φcp(t, f) :=
1
√

(
a−
 
eitω
ˆf

, t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd).
In the classical ﬁeld theory, the canonical conjugate momentum ﬁeld πcl
is given by ˙φ∗
cl.
Taking this fact into account, we deﬁne the canonical
conjugate momentum operator πcp(t, f) by
πcp(t, f) :=

Note that
d
dtφcp(t, f)∗Ψ = πcp(t, f ∗)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(H1),
where d/dt means strong diﬀerentiation in t. It is easy to see that φcp(t, f)
and πcp(t, f) satisfy the Heisenberg CCR over S (Rd): for all f, g ∈S (Rd)
and t ∈R,
[φcp(t, f), πcp(t, g)] = i
Z
Rd f(x)g(x)dx,
[φcp(t, f), φcp(t, g)] = 0,
[πcp(t, f), πcp(t, g)] = 0
on Fb,0(H1).
(4) The Hamiltonian and the momentum operator
The Hamiltonian of the present model is deﬁned by
Hcp := dΓb(ω ⊕ω),
 

Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
617
i.e., the second quantization of the direct sum operator ω ⊕ω on H1. It is
easy to see that, for all t ∈R and f ∈S (Rd),
eitHcpφcp(0, f)e−itHcp = φcp(t, f),
eitHcpπcp(0, f)e−itHcp = πcp(t, f).
The momentum operator (Pcp,1, . . . , Pcp,d) is deﬁned by
Pcp,j := dΓb(pj ⊕pj),
j = 1, . . . , d,
where pj denotes the multiplication operator by the variable kj on L2(Rd
k).
(5) The total charge operator
In the theory of a charged quantum ﬁeld, a new object, called a charge
operator, appears. Let q ∈R \ {0} be the charge of the quantum particle
under consideration. Then the operator qI ⊕(−qI) on H1 satisﬁes
qI ⊕(−qI)(f, 0) = q(f, 0),
f ∈H+,
qI ⊕(−qI)(0, g) = −q(0, g),
g ∈H−.
Hence H+ is the eigenspace of qI ⊕(−qI) with eigenvalue +q and H−is
the eigenspace of qI ⊕(−qI) with eigenvalue −qithe charge of the anti-
particle). For this reason, qI ⊕(−qI) is called the charge operator on
the one-particle spaceH1.
The second quantization
Q := dΓb(qI ⊕(−qI)) = q dΓb(I ⊕(−I))
of the charge operator qI ⊕(−qI) is called the total charge operator on
Fb(H1). We have
QΩH1 = 0,
where ΩH1 = {1, 0, 0, . . .} is the Fock vaccum in Fb(H1).
It is easy to see that
Q = qdΓb(I ⊕0) −qdΓb(0 ⊕I)
on Fb,0(H1). Hence, by Theorem 5.17, the following commutation relations
hold on Fb,0(H1):
[Q, a+(f)∗] = qa+(f)∗,
[Q, a−(f)∗] = −qa−(f)∗,
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
Therefore, for all vectors of the form
Ψn+,n−:= a+(f1)∗· · · a+(fn+)∗a−(g1)∗· · · a−(gn−)∗ΩH1
 

618
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(n± ∈Z+, fj ∈H+, gi ∈H−), which represents a state vector consisting
of n+ particles and n−anti-particles, we have
QΨn+,n−= (n+ −n−)qΨn+,n−.
Note that (n+ −n−)q is the total charge of the state Ψn+,n−.
Let
N+ := dΓb(I ⊕0),
N−:= dΓb(0 ⊕I).
Then
Nb = N+ + N−,
Q = q(N+ −N−).
(6) Unitary representation of the proper Poincar´e group
We already know that there is a natural strongly continuous unitary repre-
sentation of the proper Poincar´e group P↑
+ on L2(Rd
k), i.e., {u(a, Λ)|(a, Λ) ∈
P↑
+} deﬁned by (10.32). The direct sum u(a, Λ) ⊕u(a, Λ) gives a repre-
sentation of P↑
+ on H1.
From this representation, one can construct a
strongly continuous unitary representation {Ucp(a, Λ)|(a, Λ) ∈P↑
+} of P↑
+
on Fb(H1) by
Ucp(a, Λ) := Γb(u(a, Λ) ⊕u(a, Λ)).
This representation has the following properties:
(i) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
Ucp(a, Λ)ΩH1 = ΩH1.
(ii) For all a ∈R1+d,
Ucp(a, I) = eia0Hcpeia1Pcp,1 · · · eiadPcp,d.
(iii) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈S (R1+d),
Ucp(a, Λ)φcp(f)Ucp(a, Λ)−1 = φcp(f(a,Λ))
on Fb,0(H1).
(7) Vacuum expectation values
Using (10.87), (10.88) and the fact that a±(f)ΩH1 = 0 (f ∈L2(Rd
k)), one
can show that, for all f, g ∈S (R1+d),
W2(f, g) := ⟨ΩH1, φcp(f)φcp(g)∗ΩH1⟩

Unitary equivalence to the system of two neutral
quantum scalar ﬁelds
The classical charged ﬁeld φcl(x) given by (10.86) is written in terms of two
real ﬁelds φ1 and φ2 as follows:
φcl(x) =

√
2(φcl,1(x) + iφcl,2(x))

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We want to show that a similar structure exists in the quantum ﬁeld φcp
too. For this purpose, we note that φcl

This suggests that, in the quantum ﬁeld version, the annihilation operators
a1(·) and a2(·) of two neutral quantum scalar ﬁelds are unitarily equivalent
to (a+(·) + a−(·))/
√
2 and (a+(·) −a−(·))/
√
2 i respectively. Indeed this is
true as is shown below.
Let Fj = Fb(Rd
k) (j = 1, 2) be the boson Fock space for a free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld φj(·), where φj(·) is a copy of the free neutral KG ﬁeld
φ(·) deﬁned by (10.35). We denote the annihilation operator on Fj(L2(Rd
k))
by aj(·) as suggested above. The Hilbert space of the composite system of
the two free neutral KG ﬁelds is given by
F := F1 ⊗F2.
By Theorem 5.38, there exists a unitary operator V : F →Fb(H1) such
that
V Ω0 ⊗Ω0 = ΩH1
and
V (a1(f) ⊗I)V −1 = a+(f),
V (I ⊗a2(f))V −1 = a−(f).
f ∈L2(Rd
k),
We next deﬁne a linear operator T on H1 by
T (f, g) =
f + ig

,
(f, g) ∈H1.
It is easy to see that T is unitary. Hence Γb(T ) is unitary on Fb(H1). By
Theorem 5.30, we have
Γb(T )a+(f, 0)Γb(T )−1 = a(T (f, 0)) =
1
√
2a(f, f) = a+(f) + a−(f)

and
Γb(T )a−(f, 0)Γb(T )−1 = a(T (0, f)) =
1
√
2a(if, −if) = a+(f) −a−(f)

on Fb,0(H1). Therefore the operator
UT := Γb(T )V
is unitary from F to Fb(H1) and
UT a1(f) ⊗IU −1

2
,
UT I ⊗a2(f)U −1
T
= a+(f) −a−(f)

on Fb,0(H1). Hence, for all f ∈S (R1+d), we obtain
UT
1
√
2
(φ1(f) ⊗I + iI ⊗φ2(f))U −1
T
= φcp(f)
on Fb,0(H1).
The unitary operator T has the matrix reresentation
T =

Hence it follows that, for any linear operator A on L2(Rd
k),
T

as an operator on H1. Therefore we have
UT (Hb ⊗I + I ⊗Hb)U −1
T
= Hcp
and
UT ( ˆPb,j ⊗I + I ⊗ˆPb,j)U −1
T
= Pcp,j,
j = 1, . . . , d.
Thus we see that the theory of the charged quantum scalar ﬁeld φcp is
equivalent to that of the pair (φ1, φ2) of two quantum scalar ﬁelds. This
structure may be useful to construct models of interacting charged quantum
scalar ﬁelds.

PCT theorem
Finally we brieﬂy look at the PCT symmetry in the free charged quantum
scalar ﬁeld. Let uC : H1 →H1 be deﬁned by
uC(f+, f−) = (f ∗
−, f ∗

(f+, f−) ∈H1.
Then it is easy to see that uC is anti-unitary.
We call uC the charge
conjugation operator on H1.
As is seen, uC exchanges a state of a
particle and a state of an anti-particle with complex conjugation.
Let I0 and Is be deﬁned by (8.62) and (8.63) respectively. For each
f ∈S (R1+d), we deﬁne ˜f ∈S (R1+d)) by
˜f(x) = f(−x) = f(IsI0x).
Theorem 10.18 (PCT theorem). For all f ∈S (R1+d),
Γb(uC)φcp(f)Γb(uC)−1 = φcp( ˜f)∗
(10.91)
on Fb,0(H1).
Proof. We have the following equations on Fb,0(H1):

studied in this chapter, the methods of the ﬁnite volume approximations
discussed in Section 9.9 are valid without essential changes; only the one-
particle Hamiltonan takes a diﬀerent form from that of the one-particle

limit of the Hamiltonian of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld in the ﬁnite
volume approximation.
Let ω be given by (10.2). Then the Hamiltonian of the free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld in the ﬁnite volume approximation is given by
H(L)

Theorem 10.19. Let m > 0. Then:

(ii) For all β > 0,

Chapter 11
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic
Fields
11.1
Classical Theory of Electromagneic Fields
11.1.1
The Maxwell equations and gauge invariance
As is well known, most of macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena are ex-
plained by the theory of electromagnetism established by Maxwell. A basic
object in this theory is the pair (E, B) of an electric ﬁeld E = (E1, E2, E3) :
M4 →R3 and a magnetic ﬁeld B = (B1, B2, B3) : M4 →R3 on the 4-
dimensional Minkowski space-time M4 = {x = (ct, x)|t ∈R, x ∈R3} (c is
the speed of light in the vacuum) obeying the Maxwell equations:
(M.1)
div E = ̺
ε0
,
(M.2)
rot E = −∂tB,
(M.3)
div B = 0,
(M.4)
rot B =
j
c2ε0
+ 1
c2 ∂tE,
where div u := P3
j=1 ∂juj (the spatial divergence of u = (u1, u2, u3) :
M4 →R3), rot u := (∂2u3 −∂3u2, ∂3u1 −∂1u3, ∂1u2 −∂2u1) (the spatial
rotation of u), j = (j1, j2, j3) : M4 →R3 denotes a current density, ̺ :
M4 →R denotes a charge density and ε0 is the dielectric constant in the
vacuum. Here we use the MKSA unit system.
Henceforth we move to the unit system with c = 1. It follows from a
basic theorem in vector analysis (Poincar´e lemma) that (M.3) implies the
existence of a vector ﬁeld A = (A1, A2, A3) : M4 →R3 such that
B = rot A.
(11.1)
The vector ﬁeld A is called a vector potential. Substituting (11.1) for
(M.2), we have rot (E + ∂tA) = 0. Hence there exists a scalar ﬁeld φ :
629
 

630
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
M4 →R such that E + ∂tA = −∇φ, i.e.,
E = −∂tA −∇φ,
(11.2)
where ∇:= (∂1, ∂2, ∂3). The scalar ﬁeld φ is called a scalar potential.
The pair
A := (φ, A)
is called an electromagnetic potential or a gauge potential.1
We have from (11.2) and (M.1)
−∆φ(x) −div ∂tA(x) = ̺(x)
ε0
,
(11.3)
where ∆:= div ∇= P3
j=1 ∂2
j (3-dimensional Laplacian). On the other
hand, (11.1), (11.2) and (M.4) give
□A(x) + ∇(∂tφ(x) + div A(x)) = j(x)
ε0
,
(11.4)
where □:= ∂2
t −∆(4-dimensional d’Alembertian).
Conversely, for any vector ﬁeld A = (φ, A) : M4 →M4 satisfying (11.3)
and (11.4), the vector ﬁelds B and E deﬁned by (11.1) and (11.2) satisfy
the Maxwell equations (M.1)–(M.4).
Thus the electromagnetic theory is essentially equivalent to the theory
on vector ﬁelds A obeying (11.3) and (11.4).
11.1.2
A diﬃculty in constructing a quantum
electromagnetic ﬁeld
In constructing a quantum version of the classical electromagnetic theory,
i.e., a quantum electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, one encounters with some dif-
ﬁculty in contrast to the case of de Broglie ﬁeld or a scalar ﬁeld. One of the
reasons is in that the components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B) are
not independent, being mutually related through the Maxwell equations,
even in the case j = 0 and ̺ = 0 (the case where there exist no currents
and no charges). So it may be natural to try to ﬁnd a quantum version
(a “quantized” version) of the electromagnetic potential A rather than the
electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B). If this can be done, then one may automati-
cally obtain a quantum version of (E, B) through (11.1) and (11.2).
As is seen from (11.3) and (11.4), the components of A are not inde-
pendent mutually. But, by making use of some invariance in the theory,
1Strictly speaking, A is the 1-form φdx0 + P3
j=1 Ajdxj.
 

Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
631
the dependence among the components of the electromagnetic potential A
can be expressed in a simple form as is shown below. This invariance is
an invariance associated with non-uniqueness of electromagnetic potentials
which yield the same electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B). Indeed, it is easy to see
that, for any diﬀerentiable function Λ on M4, the electromagnetic potential
A′ = (φ′, A′) deﬁned by
A′ = A + ∇Λ,
φ′ = φ −∂tΛ
(11.5)
gives the same electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B) as that derived from A and
obeys (11.3) and (11.4) with A replaced by A′.
The correspondence
GΛ : A →A′,
A′ := GΛ(A)
is called the gauge transformation. The function Λ which deﬁnes this
transformation is called the gauge function or simply the gauge. Thus
the electromagnetic theory is invariant under the gauge transformations.
This property is called the gauge invariance.
By a gauge transformation, the ﬁeld equations (11.3) and (11.4) may be
brought into simpler forms. Such a simpliﬁcation is called a gauge ﬁxing.
Here we give two examples.
(A) Coulomb gauge
Let us ﬁnd a gauge function Λ0 such that A′ = GΛ0(A) and div A′ = 0.
This condition is equivalent to
∆Λ0 = −div A.
(11.6)
Hence, for each t ∈R, Λ0(t, ·) should be a solution to a 3-dimensional
Poisson equation. By Example D.14 in Appendix D,
Λ0(t, x) :=
Z
R3
div A(t, y)
4π|x −y| dy,
(t, x) ∈M4,
is a solution to (11.6) under a suitable condition for div A. Thus, for such a
vector potential A, we have div A′ = 0, i.e., A′ is divergence free. Thus we
have seen that, for a suitable class of vector potentials, it is always possible
by a gauge transformation to bring any element in the class to a vector
potential which is divergence free. In the case where a vector potential
is divergence free, one says that the Coulomb gauge or the radiation
gauge is taken.
 

632
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(B) Lorenz gauge
One can also consider an electromagnetic potential A satisfying the Lorenz
condition2
∂tφ + div A = 0
(see Problem 1). In this case one says that the Lorenz gauge is taken. In
relativistic notation, this condition is written as
∂µ eAµ = 0,
where eA = ( eAµ)3
µ=0 := (φ, −A1, −A2, −A3) (hence eAj = Aj, j = 1, 2, 3).
Hence the Lorenz condition is relativistically invariant.
11.2
Free
Electromagnetic
Potentials
in
the
Coulomb
Gauge
Let A be an electromagnetic potential in the Coulomb gauge:
div A = 0.
(11.7)
Then (11.3) and (11.4) take the following forms:
−∆φ(x) = ̺(x)
ε0
,
(11.8)
□A(x) + ∂t∇φ(x) = j(x)
ε0
.
(11.9)
Equation (11.8) shows that φ satisﬁes the 3-dimensional Poisson equa-
tion. Hence, under a suitable condition for φ and ̺, we have
φ(t, x) =
Z
R3
̺(t, y)
4πε0|x −y|dy.
Hence the scalar potential φ is determined by the charge density ̺.
Now, as the simplest case, let us consider the case where charges and
currents do not exist in the space-time:
j = 0,
̺ = 0.
An electromagnetic ﬁeld and an electromagnetic potential in this case are
called a free electromagnetic ﬁeld and a free electromagnetic po-
tential respectively. Then a free electromagnetic potential in the Coulomb
gauge satisﬁes
div A = 0,
(11.10)
φ = 0,

□A(x) = 0.

Hence each Aj obeys the free wave equation (the free KG equation with
mass zero). Therefore, as in the case of the free KG equation, a general
solution to (11.12) is given as follows:
Aj(t, x) =
Z

(11.13)
where aj(k) is a function on R3 such that
R
R3 |k|s|aj(k)|dk < ∞, s =
−1/2, 3/2.
Remark 11.1. Equations (11.10)–(11.12) are not Lorentz invariant. This
may be a fault in using the Coulomb gauge. But, as suggested by (11.13)
and as shown below, a quantum version of Aj can be constructed easier
than in the case of other gauges. To maintain Lorentz invariance, one can
use, e.g., the Lorenz gauge. But, in this case, it becomes more diﬃcult
to construct a quantum version of A, since the need of using an indeﬁnite
metric Hilbert space occurs (see, e.g., [Wightman and G˚arding (1964)] for
details).
The Fourier transformation of (11.10) takes the form:
3

(k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3),
where

3
X
j=1
kjaj(k) = 0,
k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3.
This means that, for each k ∈R3, the vector a(k) := (a1(k), a2(k), a3(k))
is orthogonal to k.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For each k ∈R3\{0}, there exists a unit vector e(1)(k) ∈R3 orthogonal
to k: k · e(1)(k) = 0. Then the vector
e(2)(k) := k
|k| × e(1)(k)
is a unit vector satisfying
e(1)(k) × e(2)(k) = k
|k|,
e(1)(k) · e(2)(k) = 0,
where, for vectors u = (u1, u2, u3), v = (v1, v2, v3) ∈R3, u × v denotes the
exterior product of them:
u × v := (u2v3 −u3v2, u3v1 −u1v3, u1v2 −u2v1).
Hence {k/|k|, e(1)(k), e(2)(k)} forms an orthonormal basis of R3.
Since a(k) is orthogonal to k, a(k) is expanded as
a(k) = a(1)
cl (k)e(1)(k) + a(2)
cl (k)e(2)(k)
with a(r)
cl (k) := a(k) · e(r)(k), r = 1, 2. Hence, for j = 1, 2, 3,

where e(r)(k) = (e(r)
1 (k), e(r)
2 (k), e(r)
3 (k)) (r = 1, 2).
Remark 11.2. The vector e(r)(k) physically denotes a polarization of an
electromagnetic wave with wave number vector k. For this reason, e(1)(k)
and e(2)(k) are called polarization vectors with wave number vector k.
For each k ∈R3 \ {0} and fr : R3 →C (r = 1, 2), the C3-valued function
u(±)
k,r (t, x) := fr(k)e(r)(k)e±i|k|t∓ik·x
on M4 are solutions to (11.12). These are called plane wave solutions.
Physically each of u±
k,r describes a plane wave with wave number vector
k and polarization e(r)(k). These plane waves are transversal waves, since
the direction of oscillation (the direction of e(r)(k)) is perpendicular to the
direction of movement (the direction of k). Thus the free electromagnetic
vector potential A given by (11.14) can be viewed as a superposition of
transversal plane waves.

Quantum Radiation Field
We are now ready to construct a quantum version of an electromagnetic
vector potential in the Coulomb gauge. The construction can be done in
the same way as in the case of a free de Broglie ﬁeld or a free KG ﬁeld.
Namely we deﬁne an operator-valued distribution a(r)(f ∗) (f ∈S (R3), r =
1, 2) acting in a Hilbert space H such that its operator-valued distribution
kernel a(r)(k) (k ∈R3) satisﬁes the commutation relations
[a(r)(k), a(s)(k′)∗] = δrsδ(k −k′),
(11.15)
[a(r)(k), a(s)(k′)] = 0,
[a(r)(k)∗, a(s)(k′)∗] = 0, r, s = 1, 2,(11.16)
on a dense subspace of H and replace a(r)
cl (k) in (11.14) by a(r)(k) to obtain
a quantum version of Aj(t, x).
 

636
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For mathematical generality, we consider the case where R3 is replaced
by Rd (d ≥2).3 It is easy to extend the discussions in the preceding section
to the present case.
We construct a quantum version corresponding to a classical electro-
magnetic vector potential as an operator-valued distribution acting in the
boson Fock space
Frad := Fb(E ) =
∞
M
n=0
⊗n
s E
(11.17)
over the (d −1) direct sum
E := ⊕d−1L2(Rd
k)
of L2(Rd
k).
As in the 3-dimensional case, for each k ∈Rd \ {0}, there exists an
orthonormal basis {k/|k|, e(1)(k), . . . , e(d−1)(k)} of Rd:
e(r)(k) · e(s)(k) = δrs,
e(r)(k) · k = 0,
r, s = 1, . . . , d −1.
The unit vectors e(r)(k) are called polarization vectors with wave num-
ber vector k in the d-dimensional space.
Remark 11.3. The choice of polarization vectors is not unique. If d ≥3,
then the vector-valued function:e(r) : Rd \ {0} →Rd can not be continuous
on the whole space Rd \ {0}. This is due to that, if d ≥3, then the parallel
translations on the (d −1)-dimensional unit sphere Sd−1 = {k ∈Rd| |k| =
1} are not commutative. But, as the next example shows, one can take
each e(r) to be continuous except on a null set.
Example 11.1. For j = 1, · · · , d, we deﬁne Mj := {k = (k1, · · · , kd) ∈
Rd|kj = 0} and set S := Rd \
 ∪d
j=1Mj

= ∩d
j=1M c
j . For each k ∈S and
r = 1, . . . , d −1, we deﬁne a vector w(r)(k) ∈Rd by
w(r)(k) = (0, 0, . . . , 0,
rth
⌣
kr, 0, . . . , 0).
It is easy to see that the vectors k, w(1)(k), . . . , e(d−1) are linearly indepen-
dent. By applying the Gramm-Schmidt orthogonalization method to these
vectors, we obtain an orthonormal basis {k/|k|, e(1)(k), . . . , e(d−1)(k)} of
Rd. Since each w(r) is continuous on S, so is each e(r). We extend the
domain of e(r) to Rd by e(r)(k) := 0 for k ∈Sc. The Lebesgue measure of
Sc = ∪d
j=1Mj is zero. Hence e(r) is a.e. continuous.
3It is important to consider the dimensional dependence of a quantum theory, because
it may bring one deeper cognition of conceptual structures underlying quantum phenom-
ena.
 

Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields

We denote by a(f) (f := (fr)d−1
r=1 ∈E ) the annihilation operator on
Frad with test vector f and by Nrad the number operator on Frad. For
each f ∈L2(Rd
k) and r = 1, . . . , d −1, we deﬁne fr ∈E by
fr = (0, · · · , 0,
rth
⌣
f , 0, · · · , 0)
and set
a(r)(f) := a(fr).
As in Example 8.5, the correspondence a(r) : S (Rd) ∋f 7→a(r)(f ∗) gives
an operator-valued distribution with values in L(Frad) and common do-
main D(N 1/2
rad ). We call a(r)(f) (f ∈L2(Rd)) the photon annihilation
operator with test function f. The adjoint a(r)(f)∗is called the photon
creation operator with test function f.
We denote by a(r)(k) (resp. a(r)(k)∗) the operator-valued distribution
kernel of a(r)(f ∗) (resp. a(r)(f)∗):
a(r)(f) =
Z
Rd f(k)∗a(r)(k)dk,
a(r)(f)∗=
Z
Rd f(k)a(r)(k)∗dk.
It follows that, for all f, g ∈L2(Rd
k) and r, s = 1, . . . , d −1,
[a(r)(f), a(s)(g)∗] = δrs ⟨f, g⟩,
(11.18)
[a(r)(f), a(s)(g)] = 0,
[a(r)(f)∗, a(s)(g)∗] = 0
(11.19)
on the ﬁnite particle subspace Fb,0(E ). Hence, in symbolical expressions,
we have (11.15) and (11.16). Thus the desired operator-valued distributions
are constructed.
For each f ∈L1(R1+d), we deﬁne a function F0f on Rd
k by
(F0f)(k) :=
1
(2π)(1+d)/2
Z
R1+d f(t, x)ei|k|t−ik·xdtdx = ˆf(−|k|, k), k ∈Rd
k.
The mapping F0 is the transformation F with m = 0 (see (10.36)) extended
to L1(R1+d).
We introduce a function ωph on Rd by
ωph(k) := |k|,
k ∈Rd.
Physically ωph(k) means the angular frequency of a photon with momentum
k.
By the classical result (11.14) and the aforementioned scheme to obtain
a quantum version of the classical electromagnetic vector potential, it is
natural to deﬁne a smeared operator Aj(f) with test function f in the set
Lph(R1+d) := {f ∈L1(R1+d)|F0f/√ωph ∈L2(Rd)}

It follows from Lemma 10.3 that S (R1+d) ⊂Lph(R1+d).
Basic properties of Aj(f) are summarized in the next theorem:
Theorem 11.1.
(i) For each j = 1, . . . , d, the mapping Aj : f 7→Aj(f), f ∈S (R1+d),
is an operator-valued distribution with values in L(Frad) and common
domain D(N 1/2
rad )).
(ii) If f ∈Lph(R1+d) is real-valued, then Aj(f) (j = 1, . . . , d) is essentially
self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(E ).
(iii) (cyclicity) Let ΩE be the Fock vacuum in Frad. Then the subspace
Drad := span

(iv) (free wave equation) For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ), f ∈S (R1+d) and j =
1, . . . , d,
Aj(□f)Ψ = 0.
(v) (Coulomb gauge condition) For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

Aj(∂jf)Ψ = 0.
(11.21)
Proof. (i) Similar to the proof of Lemma 10.5.

Tj(f) := (ω−1/2
ph
e(r)
j F0f)d−1
r=1 ∈E ,
f ∈Lph(R1+d).
Then we have
Aj(f) =

f ∈Lph,R(R1+d),
(11.22)
 

Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
639
where
Lph,R(R1+d) := {f ∈Lph(R1+d)|f ∗= f}.
Hence, by an application of Theorem 5.22, Aj(f) with f ∈Lph,R(R1+d) is
essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(E ).
(iii) We ﬁrst show that the subspace
D1,rad := span

Tj(f)|f ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , d
	
is dense in E . Let g = (g(r))d−1
r=1 ∈D1,rad
⊥. Then, for all f ∈S (R1+d) and
j = 1, . . . , d, ⟨g, Tj(f)⟩= 0, which means that

Hence, by Lemma 10.9, Pd−1
r=1 g(r)(k)e(r)
j (k) = 0, a.e.k.
By multiplying
the both sides by e(s)
j (k) (s = 1, . . . , d −1), then taking the sum over j
and using the orthonormality of {e(r)(k)}d−1
r=1, we obtain g(s)(k) = 0, a.e.k.
Hence g = 0. Thus D1,rad is dense in E .
Using the fact just shown and (11.22), one can prove the density of Drad
in Frad in the same manner as in the proof of Theorem 10.11.
(iv) Similar to the proof of Lemma 10.7.
(v) As is easily seen, for each j = 1, . . . , d,
(F0∂jf)(k) = ikj(F0f)(k),
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd.
Hence
d

e(r)
j (k)(F0∂jf)(k) = 0,
r = 1, . . . , d −1,
which implies (11.21).
The operator-vector
A(f) := (A1(f), . . . , Ad(f))
(f ∈Lph(R1+d))
is called the free quantum radiation ﬁeld or the free photon ﬁeld in
the Coulomb gauge.
Theorem 11.1(iv) and (v) show that the free quantum radiation ﬁeld
obeys the d’Alembert equation and the Coulomb gauge condition in the
sense of operator-valued distribution. In this way a quantum version of a
classical free electromagnetic vector potential is constructed.

jl ( ˜f),
f ∈S (R1+d),

Z
R1+d f(x)(∆jl ∗g)(x)dx = i(∆jl ∗g)(f),
where ∆jl ∗g denotes the convolution of ∆jl and g (see Appendix D).
To obtain a more explicit form of ejl, one needs only to apply the
following elementary fact:
Lemma 11.1. Let {v1, . . . , vd} be an orthonormal basis of Rd with vj =

Formula (11.24) is sometimes referred to as the completeness of the
orthonormal system (ONS) {vp}d

it is equivalent to (11.25), the completeness of the ONS {vp}d

and a quantum magnetic ﬁeld B(f) = (B1(f), B2(f), B3(f)) with f ∈

where (11.11) is taken into account to deﬁne Ej(f). By Theorem 11.1(iv),
we have
Ej(□f) = 0,
Bj(□f) = 0

The correspondence :f 7→Aj(t, f) is called the sharp-time free quantum
radiation ﬁeld at time t.
It is easy to see that the mapping: S (Rd) ∋f 7→Aj(t, f) is an operator-
valued distribution with values in L(Frad) and common domain D(N 1/2
rad )).
Moreover, for all g ∈S (R), f ∈S (Rd
x) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ),
Aj(g × f)Ψ =
Z
R
g(t)Aj(t, f)Ψdt, j = 1, . . . , d.
where the integral is taken in the strong sense.
As is easily seen, for all t ∈R, f, g ∈S (Rd) and j, l = 1, . . . , d, we have
[Aj(t, f), Al(t, g)] = 0
on Fb,0(E ). Namely, for each t ∈R, {Aj(t, f)|j = 1, . . . , d, f ∈S (Rd)} is
a family of commuting operators on Fb,0(E ).
Deﬁnition (11.30) means that the operator-valued distribution kernel
Aj(t, x) of Aj(t, f) is symbolically written as follows4:

Theorem 11.2.
(i) If f ∈M−1/2(Rd) is real-valued, then Aj(t, f) (t ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d) is
essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(E ).
4This is the usual form which appears in physics literatures on QFT. As in the case of
the free quantum KG ﬁeld, Aj(t, x) has mathematical meaning as a sesquilinear form.

C∞(ωph). Hence, by Lemma 5.22, Aj(t, f)Ψ is inﬁnitely strongly diﬀer-

for each n ∈N, the (2n −1)-point VEV’s vanish and the 2n-point VEV’s
are written in terms of two-point VEV’s.

Canonical Conjugate Field
In the classical theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld, the canonical conjugate
momentum (ﬁeld) of the electromagnetic vector potential is given by the
time derivative of it. Hence, in the quantum theory too, it may be natural
to deﬁne the canonical conjugate momentum operator as the time derivative
of the sharp-time free quantum radiation ﬁeld. Noting (11.33), we deﬁne

the canonical conjugate ﬁeld or canonical conjugate momentum
πj(t, f) (t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd), j = 1, . . . , d) of Aj(t, f) by

It follows from (11.33) with n = 1 that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ),
πj(t, f)Ψ = ∂tAj(t, f)Ψ,
f ∈S (Rd
x), j = 1, . . . , d,
It is easy to see that, for all t ∈R and f, g ∈S (Rd),
[πj(t, f), πl(t, g)] = 0
on Fb,0(E ).
Remark 11.4. As is easily seen, πj(t, f) can be deﬁned also for f ∈S ′(Rd)
such that √ωph ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k).
By simple direct computations, we see that, for all s, t ∈R, f, g ∈
S (Rd) and j, l = 1, . . . , d
[Aj(t, f), πl(s, g)] = i
Z
Rd ejl(k) ˆf(k)ˆg(−k) cos(|k|(t −s))dk
on Fb,0(E ), where we have used the fact that ejl(k) = ejl(−k) (see (11.26)).
In particular, in the case of equal-time s = t, we have
[Aj(t, f), πl(t, g)] = i
Z
Rd ejl(k) ˆf(k)ˆg(−k)dk.
To rewrite the right hand side, we introduce a linear functional δtr
jl :
S (Rd) →C (j, l = 1, . . . , d) by
δtr
jl(f) :=
1
(2π)d/2

It is easy to see that δtr
jl ∈S ′(Rd). We call this tempered distribution the
transverse delta distribution. In terms of this distribution, we have
[Aj(t, f), πl(t, g)] = i(δtr
jl ∗g)(f)
Note that the right hand side is not equal to i ⟨f ∗, g⟩.
Hence
{Aj(t, f), πj(t, g)|t ∈R, f, g ∈S (Rd), j = 1, . . . , d} does not satisfy
Heisenberg CCR.

Hamiltonian and Momentum Operator
The function ωph gives the self-adjoint operator
hrad := ⊕d−1ωph
acting in E (the right hand side is a direct sum operator). The boson second
quantization
Hrad := dΓb(hrad)
(11.34)
of hrad is called the Hamiltonian of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld.
Indeed, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 11.3.
(i) For all t ∈R, f ∈S (R1+d), Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ) and j = 1, . . . , d,
Aj(f(t,0))Ψ = eitHradAj(f)e−itHradΨ.
(11.35)
(ii) For all t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd), Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ) and j = 1, . . . , d,
Aj(t, f)Ψ = eitHradAj(0, f)e−itHradΨ.
Proof. (i) By Lemma 5.21, we have

On the other hand, we have
(F0f(t,0))(k) = eitωphF0f,
(F0f ∗

Hence (11.35) holds.
(ii) Similar to part (i).
The momentum operator of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld
(Prad,1, . . . , Prad,d) is deﬁned by
Prad,j := dΓb(⊕d−1kj),
where kj (= −kj) denotes the multiplication operator on L2(Rd
k) by kj
(⊕d−1kj is a self-adjoint operator on E ).
As in the case of the energy-momentum operator of the free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld, the energy-momentum operator
Prad := (Hrad, Prad,1, . . . , Prad,d)
of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld is strongly commuting. In the same way
as in the proof of Theorem 11.3, the following theorem is proved:

Theorem 11.4.
(i) For all a = (a1, . . . , ad) ∈Rd, f ∈S (R1+d), Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

Aj(f(0,a))Ψ = eiPd

Aj(t, fa)Ψ = eiPd
j=1 ajPrad,jAj(t, f)e−iPd
j=1 ajPrad,jΨ.
Applying Theorem 5.3, we obtain the following results on the spectra
of Hrad and Prad,j:
σ(Hrad) = [0, ∞),
σp(Hrad) = {0},
σ(Prad,j) = R,
σp(Prad,j) = {0}, j = 1, . . . , d,
where ker Hrad = ker Prad,j = {αΩE |α ∈C}. In particular, the ground
state of Hrad is unique with the ground state energy being zero.
Note that the eigenvalue 0 of Hrad is an embedded eigenvalue (an eigen-
value embedded in the continuous spectrum). This comes from that the
mass of a photon is zero.
Concerning the energy-momentum spectrum of the free quantum radi-
ation ﬁeld (the joint spectrum of Prad) is found to be
σJ(Prad) = V +.
The method of proof is similar to that of Theorem 10.9.

Example 11.3. A typical choice of ρ is given by ρ(k) = χ[0,κ](|k|) with
κ > 0 (χ[0,κ] is the characteristic function of the interval [0, κ]), In this case,
κ is called the momentum cutoﬀ.

ﬁeld of a free relativistic charged particle with spin 1/2.
12.1
Classical Theory of the Free Dirac Field
A relativistic charged particle with spin 1/2 (e.g., electron, proton, . . .)
is called a Dirac particle. In this chapter, we describe a mathematical
construction of the quantum ﬁeld whose quanta are free identical Dirac
particles. This quantum ﬁeld is called the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld.
But we ﬁrst discuss the classical free Dirac ﬁeld.
12.1.1
Free Dirac equation
We denote by M4 the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time as before and
by
g = (gµν) =




1 0
0
0
0 −1 0
0
0 0 −1 0
0 0
0 −1




the standard matrix representation of the metric tensor of M4. The matrix
components of g−1 are denoted gµν: g−1 = (gµν). It follows that
gµν = gµν,
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
For a natural number n ≥2, we denote by In the n × n identity matrix.
But sometimes we omit the subscript n in In.
A set {γµ ∈M4(C)|µ = 0, 1, 2, 3} of 4 × 4 complex matrices is called a
representation of the gamma (γ)-matrices associated with M4 if they
655

satisfy anti-commutation relations
{γµ, γν} = 2gµνI4, µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.1)
where {X, Y } := XY + Y X, and (γ0)∗= γ0 (Hermiteness), (γj)∗=
−γj, j = 1, 2, 3 (anti-Hermiteness).
Remark 12.1. The algebra generated by elements θµ, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, with
unit element I satisfying {θµ, θν} = 2gµνI (µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3) is called
the Cliﬀord algebra associated with M4. Precisely speaking, {γµ ∈
M4(C)|µ = 0, 1, 2, 3} should be called a representation of the algebra. But
we follow the convention in the physics literature.
The following two examples of representation of the γ-matrices are basic
ones.
Example 12.1. Let σ := (σ1, σ2, σ3) be the set of the Pauli matrices :
σ1 :=
 0 1
1 0

,
σ2 :=
 0 −i
i 0

,
σ3 :=
 1 0
0 −1

.
(12.2)
Then the following {γµ}3
µ=0 is a representation of the γ-matrices:
γ0 =
 0 I2
I2 0

,
γj =
 0 −σj
σj
0

, j = 1, 2, 3.
(12.3)
This representation is called the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices.
For an origin of the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices and related as-
pects, see Problem 10.
Example 12.2 (standard representation of the γ-matrices).
γ0 :=
I2
0
0 −I2

,
γj =
 0
σj
−σj 0

, j = 1, 2, 3.
(12.4)
Hence, in the present representation of the γ-matrices, γ0 is diagonalized,
showing that σ(γ0) = σp(γ0) = {±1} with the multiplicity of each eigen-
value being 2.
It is easy to see that, for any representation {γµ}µ=0,1,2,3 of the γ-
matrices and all unitary matrices U ∈M4(C), {UγµU −1}µ=0,1,2,3 is a
representation of the γ-matrices.
More generally one has the following
important fact:
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
657
Lemma 12.1 (Pauli’s lemma). Let {γµ
1 }3
µ=0 and {γµ
2 }3
µ=0 be two sets
of 4 × 4 matrices satisfying the anti-commutation relations (12.1) with γµ
replaced by γµ
j (j = 1, 2, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3). Then there is an invertible (regular)
matrix S ∈M4(C) such that
γµ
2 = Sγµ
1 S−1,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.5)
The matrix S is uniquely determined up to scalar multiples.
Proof. Let {γµ}3
µ=0 be the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices. Then,
by Lemma 2.25 in [Thaller (1992)], there is an invertible (regular) matrix
Sj ∈M4(C) such that
γµ
j = SjγµS−1
j
,
j = 1, 2, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Hence, letting S := S2S−1
1 , we obtain (12.5).
To prove the second half of the lemma, let S′ ∈M4(C) be an invert-
ible matrix satisfying γµ
2 = S′γµ
1 S′−1, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Then γµ
1 (S−1S′) =
(S−1S′)γ1. Since {γµ
1 |µ = 0, 1, 2, 3} is irreducible, it follows that S−1S′ =
cI4 with a constant c ∈C. Hence S′ = cS.
In Lemma 12.1, the Hermiteness of γ0
j and the anti-Hermiteness of γk
j
(k = 1, 2, 3) are not assumed. Hence S is not necessarily unitary. But, if
these properties are assumed, then S can be taken to be unitary:
Lemma 12.2. Let {γµ′}3
µ=0 and {γµ}3
µ=0 be two representations of the γ-
matrices associated with M4. Then there is a unitary matrix U ∈M4(C)
such that
γµ′ = UγµU −1,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.6)
The unitary matrix U is uniquely determined up to scalar multiples by eiθ
(θ ∈R).
Proof. By Lemma 12.1, there exists an invertible matrix S ∈M4(C) satis-
fying γµ′ = SγµS−1, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Taking the Hermitian conjugate of this
equation, we have γµ′ = S∗−1γµS∗. Hence [γµ, S∗S] = 0, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Therefore, by the irreducibility of {γµ|µ = 0, 1, 2, 3}, S∗S = cI4 with a
constant c ∈C. Note that S∗S is positive and invertible. Hence c > 0.
Hence the matrix U := S/√c is unitary satisfying (12.6). The second half
of the lemma can be proven in the same way as in the proof of the second
half of Lemma 12.1.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 12.2 allows one to transform relations in a speciﬁc representation
of the γ-matrices to those in any representation of the γ- matrices. Hence,
without loss of generality, one can work with a speciﬁc representation of
the γ-matrices. But, in what follows, we work with any representation of
the γ-matrices unless otherwise stated.
Example 12.3. Let {γµ}µ=0,1,2,3 be the Weyl representation of the γ-
matrices and
U :=
1
√
2
I2 I2
I2 −I2

.
Then U is a unitary matrix and {UγµU −1}µ=0,1,2,3 is the standard repre-
sentation of the γ-matrices.
A point in M4 is denoted as x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) = (x0, x) with x0 =
x0 = t (time coordinate), xj = −xj, j = 1, 2, 3 (we use a physical unit
system where c = 1 and ℏ= 1).
Let M ≥0 be a constant. Then the ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equa-
tion
(iγµ∂µ −M) ψ(x) = 0
(12.7)
for a C4-valued function ψ : M4 →C4
ψ(x) =

is called the free Dirac equation with mass M, where, as before, ∂µ :=
∂/∂xµ and, in γµ∂µ, the summation over µ from 0 to 3 is understood
(Einstein’s convention).1
A non-zero solution ψ : M4 →C4 to (12.7) (ψ ̸= 0) is called a free
classical Dirac ﬁeld or a free Dirac spinor. This physically describes
a classical matter ﬁeld (matter wave) associated with a free Dirac particle
of mass M. A free classical Dirac ﬁeld with M > 0 (resp. M = 0) is said
to be massive (resp. massless).
1For a heuristic derivation of the free Dirac equation, see [Dirac (1958), Chapter XI]
or textbooks of relativistic quantum mechanics. Eq. (12.7) with c and ℏrecovered takes
the following form:


A remark in connection with the quantum theory of
a Dirac particle
Multiplying (12.7) by γ0 and using (γ0)2 = I4, one has
i∂ψ(t, x)
∂t
=

−i

j=1


ψ(t, x),
(12.8)
where
αj := γ0γj (j = 1, 2, 3),
β := γ0,
(12.9)
and we have replaced ∂j by the generalized partial diﬀerential operator
Dj in xj. Equation (12.8) also is called the free Dirac equation with
mass M. A feature of this equation is that it can be viewed as the time-
development equation for state vectors of the quantum system with Hamil-
tonian
hD := −i

X
j=1
αjDj + βM,
(12.10)
the free Dirac Hamiltonian with mass M, acting in the Hilbert space
L2(R3; C4) of C4-valued square integrable functions on R3 with respect
to the Lebesgue measure on R3 ( cf. Chapter 7, Problem 6). From this
point of view, (12.8) can be interpreted as an equation which describes the
time-development for state vectors of the quantum system of a free Dirac
particle of mass M. In this interpretation, ψ(t, ·) denotes a state vector of
the quantum system at time t, not a classical matter ﬁeld.
It is easy to see that the matrices αj (j = 1, 2, 3) and β are Hermitian
matrices satisfying the anti-commutation relations
{αj, αk} = 2δjkI4,
β2 = I4,
{αj, β} = 0,
j, k = 1, 2, 3.
(12.11)
Example 12.4. In the Weyl representation {γµ}3
µ=0 of the γ-matrices (see
Example 12.1), αj (j = 1, 2, 3) and β take the following forms:
αj =
σj
0
0 −σj

,
β =
 0 σ0
σ0 0

,
where
σ0 := I2 =

.
Hence
hD =

,
where σ := (σ1, σ2, σ3), D := (D1, D2, D3) and σ · D := P3

(see Example 12.2), αj (j = 1, 2, 3) and β take the following forms:
αj =

12.1.3
Discrete symmetries in the free Dirac equation
As is shown later (Subsection 12.1.5), the free Dirac equation has a relativis-
tic symmetry. But, before discussing it, it may be instructive to study dis-
crete symmetries of the free Dirac equation with respect to space-inversion,
charge conjugation and time-reversal.
Let I0 and Is be the time-reversal and the space-inversion on R1+3
respectively (see (8.62) and (8.63)) and C be a 4 × 4-matrix satisfying
CγµC−1 = −γµ,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.12)
where, for a matrix T , T denotes the complex conjugate of T . In the Weyl
representation of the γ-matrices, a choice of C is given by
C = −iγ2.
We also need a matrix
γ5 := iγ0γ1γ2γ3
(12.13)
to deﬁne a transformation of a C4-valued function on M4. The matrix γ5
is called the chiral operator in the context of the theory of Dirac ﬁelds.
Physical meanings of it will become clear later (see Proposition 12.1 and
Section 12.2). Note that γ5 is Hermitian and
γ5 = −iα1α2α3.
(12.14)
For a C4-valued function ψ : R4 →C4, we deﬁne functions ψs, ψc, ψt :
R4 →C4 as follows:
(space-inversion)
ψs(x) := γ0ψ(Isx),
(12.15)
(charge conjugation)
ψc(x) := C−1ψ(x)∗,
(12.16)
(time-reversal)
ψt(x) := γ0γ5C−1ψ(Itx)∗.
(12.17)
Example 12.6. In the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices, one has
γ5 =
 I2
0
0 −I2

.
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
661
Hence, in the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices, γ5 is diagonalized,
showing that it has eigenvalues ±1 whose multiplicity is 2 respectively. For
this reason, the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices is also called the
chiral representation.
Example 12.7. In the standard representation of the γ-matrices, one has
γ5 =
 0 I2
I2 0

.
Theorem 12.1 (P, C, T symmetries). Suppose that ψ is a solution to
the free Dirac equation (12.7). Then, for # = s, c, t, ψ# is a solution to
the free Dirac equation.
Proof. We have
∂0ψs(x) = γ0(∂0ψ)(Isx), ∂jψs(x) = −γ0(∂jψ)(Isx).
Hence, using γjγ0 = −γ0γj, we have
iγµ∂µψs(x) = γ0(iγµ∂µψ)(Isx) = γ0Mψ(Isx) = Mψs(x).
Therefore ψs satisﬁes (12.7).
Note that (12.12) implies that
γµC−1 = −C−1γµ.
Using this property, we have
iγµ∂µψc(x) = C−1iγµ∂µψ(x) = C−1Mψ(x)∗= Mψc(x).
Hence ψc is a solution to (12.7).
We have
ψt(x) = γ0γ5ψc(Itx).
Hence
∂0ψt(x) = −γ0γ5(∂0ψc)(Itx), ∂jψt(x) = γ0γ5(∂jψc)(Itx).
Using anti-commutation relations (12.1), we have (see Problem 1 for prop-
erties of the matrix γ5)
{γ5, γµ} = 0,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.18)
Using these properties and that ψc obeys the free Dirac equation as is shown
in the preceding paragraph, one sees that ψt is a solution to (12.7).

12.1.4
The special linear group SL(2, C) and the four-
dimensional proper Lorentz group
A free Dirac ﬁeld has a kind of relativistic covariance. This subsection is
devoted to a preliminary to formulate it.
We denote by SL(2, C) the set of 2 × 2 complex matrices whose deter-
minant is 1:
SL(2, C) := {A ∈M2(C)| det A = 1}.
It is easy to see that SL(2, C) forms a group with the operation of matrix
multiplication (see Appendix F). This group is called the complex special
linear group of degree 2. A vector in a two-dimensional representation
space of SL(2, C) is called a spinor.
For matrices T, S ∈M2(C), we deﬁne ⟨T, S⟩∈C by
⟨T, S⟩:= Tr (T ∗S),
where Tr denotes trace. It is easy to check that this ⟨· , · ⟩is an inner
product of M2(C) and M2(C) becomes a 4-dimensional complex Hilbert
space with the inner product.
For notational simplicity, we denote this
Hilbert space by the same symbol M2(C) again.
Lemma 12.3.
Tr (σµσν) = 2δµν,
µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.19)
Proof. Since σµσµ = σ0 for each µ, Tr (σµσµ) = 2. Hence (12.19) holds
for µ = ν.
In the case where µ = 0 and ν ̸= 0, we have Tr (σµσν) = Tr σν = 0.
In the case where j ̸= k, j, k = 1, 2, 3, using the anti-commutation
relations {σj, σk} = 0, we have Tr (σjσk) = −Tr (σkσj). By the symmetry
of trace, the right hand side is equal to −Tr (σjσk). Hence Tr (σjσk) = 0.
Relation (12.19) shows that {σµ/
√

µ=0 is an orthonormal basis of
M2(C). Hence, any T ∈M2(C) is uniquely expanded as

Let
H(2) := {H ∈M2(C)|H∗= H},

the set of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices, and deﬁne a mapping h : M4 →H(2)
by

j=1
xjσj =
 x0 + x3 x1 −ix2

,
x ∈M4.
(12.21)
It is easy to see that h is linear and
det h(x) = x2 = (x0)2 −x2.
(12.22)
Lemma 12.4. The mapping h is bijective.
Proof. By (12.21), h(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. Hence h is injective.
For any T ∈H(2), let
x0
T := 1
2Tr (σ0T ),
xj
T := 1
2Tr (σjT ), j = 1, 2, 3.
Then it is easy to see that xµ
T is a real number. By (12.20), we see that
h(xT ) = T . Hence h is surjective.
Let A ∈SL(2, C).
Then, for each x ∈M4, the matrix Ah(x)A∗is
Hermitian, i.e., Ah(x)A∗∈H(2). Hence, by Lemma 12.4, one can deﬁne a
mapping Λ(A) : M4 →M4 by
Λ(A)x := h−1(Ah(x)A∗),
x ∈M4.
(12.23)
Since h is linear, Λ(A) is linear. We have
h(Λ(A)x) = Ah(x)A∗.
(12.24)
Taking the determinant of the both sides and using (12.22), we obtain
(Λ(A)x)2 = x2.
Hence Λ(A) is a Lorentz transformation.
By (12.24) and (12.21), we have
(Λ(A)x)νσν = xνAσνA∗.
Multiplying σµ from the left and using (12.19), we obtain
2(Λ(A)x)µ = xνTr (σµAσνA∗).
This holds for all x ∈M4. Hence
Λ(A)µ
ν = 1
2Tr (σµAσνA∗), µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.25)
It follows from (12.25) that Λ(A) is a continuous function of A. Note
that
Λ(I2) = I4.
(12.26)

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
On the other hand, SL(2, C) is simply connected (see, e.g., [Yamanouchi and
Sugiura (1960), p.142, Example 1]). Hence Λ(A) is an element of L ↑
+, the
4-dimensional proper Lorentz group. Thus the correspondence: A 7→Λ(A)
deﬁnes a mapping Λ(·) from SL(2, C) to L ↑
+. This mapping has interesting
properties:
Lemma 12.5.
(i) (homomorphism) For all A, B ∈SL(2, C).
Λ(AB) = Λ(A)Λ(B).
(12.27)
(ii) Let A, B ∈SL(2, C). Then Λ(A) = Λ(B) if and only if A = B or
A = −B.
Proof. (i) For all x ∈M4,
h(Λ(AB)x) = ABh(x)B∗A∗= Ah(Λ(B)x)A∗= h(Λ(A)Λ(B)x).
By this fact and the injectivity of h, Λ(AB)x = Λ(A)Λ(B)x, which implies
(12.27).
(ii) Suppose that Λ(A) = Λ(B). Then, for all x ∈M4, Ah(x)A∗=
Bh(x)B∗. This means that AσµA∗= BσµB∗, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Hence the
matrix T := A−1B, which is in SL(2, C), satisﬁes T σµT ∗= σµ.
This
equation with µ = 0 implies that T is unitary. Hence it follows that T σj =
σjT , j = 1, 2, 3. It is easy to see that such a matrix T is a scalar matrix,
i.e., T = λI2 for some constant λ ∈C. Since det T = 1, it follows that
λ = ±1. Hence A = B or A = −B.
Conversely suppose that A = ±B. Then it immediately follows from
the deﬁnition of Λ(·) that Λ(A) = Λ(B).
Lemma 12.5(i) and (12.25) show that Λ : SL(2, C) →L ↑
+ is a continuous
representation of SL(2, C) on M4 (for terminologies in group theory, see
Subsection 2.9.2). Lemma 12.5(ii) means that N(Λ), the kernel of Λ, is
{±I2}. Namely Λ is a two to one homomorphism from SL(2, C) to L ↑
+.
Moreover, the following fact is found:
Lemma 12.6. The homomorphism Λ is surjective: Λ(SL(2, C)) = L ↑
+.
Proof. Let sl(2, C) be the Lie algebra of SL(2, C) (see Example F.2 in
Appendix F) and g = l↑
+ be the Lie algebra of L ↑
+ (see Subsection 8.8.4).
Then the diﬀerential representation dΛ of Λ (see Section F.2 in Appendix
F) is a homomorphism from sl(2, C) to g. Since N(Λ) = {±I2}, it follows
that the Lie algebra of N(Λ) is {0}. Hence, by Theorem F.2, ker dΛ = {0}.
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
665
Hence dΛ is injective. It is easy to see that, as a real vector space, sl(2, C)
is 6-dimensional. Also dim g = 6 (apply Proposition 8.5 to the case d = 3).
Hence dΛ is a bijection.
On the other hand, since L ↑
+ is connected, it follows from Theorem F.1
that any L ∈L ↑
+ is written in the form L = eX1 · · · eXN with Xj ∈g.
So, taking Yj ∈sl(2, C) such that Xj = dΛ(Yj), we have L = Λ(A) with
A := eY1 · · · eYN ∈SL(2, C). Thus Λ is surjective.
Remark 12.2. Another (direct) proof of Lemma 12.6 may be given by
showing that, for any Λ ∈L ↑
+, there exists an A ∈SL(2, C) satisfying
Λµ
ν = 1
2Tr (σµAσνA∗), µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.28)
See (12.25). Equation (12.28) is equivalent to a system of equations for the
matrix elements of A which is explicitly solved.
Remark 12.3. A continuous mapping f from an arcwise connected topo-
logical space f
X onto a topological space X is called a covering map if,
for each point x ∈X , there exists an open neighborhood Vx such that f is
a homeomorphism from each connected component of f −1(Vx) onto Vx. If
such a mapping f exists, then f
X is called a covering space of X . If X
and f
X are topological groups and f is a homomorphism, then e
X is called a
covering group of X . In particular, if the group f
X is simply connected,
then f
X is called a universal covering group of X .
In terms of these concepts, the above results show that the mapping
Λ : SL(2, C) →L ↑
+ is a covering map and SL(2, C) is a universal covering
group of L ↑
+.
By Lemma 12.5, for any representation (λ, V ) of L ↑
+ (V is a represen-
tation space), there exists a representation (ρ, V ) of SL(2, C) such that
ρ(A) = λ(Λ(A)),
A ∈SL(2, C).
But this representation is not faithful, because ρ(A) = ρ(−A) for all A ∈
SL(2, C).
Conversely suppose that a represetation (ρ, V ) of SL(2, C) is given with
ρ(−I2) = IV . By Lemma 12.6, for each g ∈L ↑
+, there exists an Ag ∈
SL(2, C) such that Λ(±Ag) = g. We have ρ(−Ag) = ρ(−I2)ρ(Ag) = ρ(Ag).
Hence one can deﬁne λ : L ↑
+ →GL(V ) by
λ(g) := ρ(Ag),
g ∈L ↑
+.
 

666
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that (λ, V ) is a representation of L ↑
+. Thus analysis of represen-
tations of L ↑
+ can be reduced to that of those of SL(2, C). In this sense,
SL(2, C) may be a more fundamental group.
Remark 12.4. In the case where ρ(−I2) ̸= IV , ρ(−Ag) ̸= ρ(Ag). Hence,
in this case, there is a correspondence: g 7→ρ(Ag) or ρ(−Ag). This corre-
spondence is called the double-valued representation of L ↑
+.

Relativistic covariance of the free Dirac equation
We are now ready to discuss a relativistic covariance of the free Dirac
equation.
Lemma 12.7. For each Λ ∈L ↑
+, there exists an invertible matrix SΛ ∈
M4(C) such that, for µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
S−1
Λ γµSΛ = Λµ
νγν.
(12.29)
The matrix SΛ is determined uniquely up to scalar multiples.
Proof. Let ρµ := Λµ
νγν (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3).
Then it is easy to see that
{ρµ, ρν} = 2gµν (µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3). Hence, by Pauli’s lemma (Lemma 12.1),
there exists an invertible matrix SΛ ∈M4(C) satisfying (12.29).
Let (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and SΛ be as in Lemma 12.7. For each ψ : M4 →C4,
we deﬁne ψ(a,Λ) : M4 →C4 by
ψ(a,Λ)(x) := SΛψ(Λ−1(x −a)),
x ∈M4.
(12.30)
Theorem 12.2. Let ψ be a solution to the free Dirac equation (12.7). Then
ψ(a,Λ) is a solution to the free Dirac equation (12.7).
Proof. Let x′ := Λ−1(x −a) and φ := ψ(a,Λ). Then
iγµ∂µφ(x) = i(Λ−1)ν
µγµSΛ∂νψ(x′)
= i(Λ−1)ν
µΛµ
αSΛγα∂νψ(x′)
(by (12.29))
= iδν
αSΛγα∂νψ(x′)
= SΛiγν∂νψ(x′) = SΛMψ(x′) = Mφ(x).
Hence φ satisﬁes (12.7).
By Lemma 12.7, for each Λ ∈L ↑
+, one can assign an invertible matrix
SΛ ∈GL(C4). Then we have a family {SΛ|Λ ∈L ↑
+} of invertible matrices.
Using (12.29), we have for all Λ1, Λ2 ∈L ↑
+
S−1
Λ1Λ2γµSΛ1Λ2 = S−1
Λ2 S−1
Λ1 γµSΛ1SΛ2,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.

Hence, puttig T := SΛ1Λ2(SΛ1SΛ2)−1, we obtain
γµT = T γµ.
Since {γµ|µ = 0, 1, 2, 3} is irreducible (see, e.g., [Thaller (1992), p.77, Ap-
pendix]), it follows that T = c(Λ1, Λ2)I4 for some c(Λ1, Λ2) ∈C. Hence
SΛ1Λ2 = c(Λ1, Λ2)SΛ1SΛ2.
Therefore,
if
c(Λ1, Λ2)
=
1
for
all
Λ1, Λ2
∈
L ↑
+,
then
the
correspondence:Λ 7→SΛ gives a representation of L ↑
+ on C4.
But it is
unclear if such a choice of c(Λ1, Λ2) is possible. However, if one uses the
homomorphism Λ(·) : SL(2, C) →L ↑
+, then it is shown that such a choice
is possible as follows.
Lemma 12.8. Let {γµ}3
µ=0 be the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices
(see Example 12.1) and, for each A ∈SL(2, C), deﬁne Sw(A) ∈M4(C) by
Sw(A) :=
A
0
0 (A∗)−1

.
(12.31)
Then Sw(A) is invertible and
Sw(A)−1γµSw(A) = Λ(A)µ
νγν,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.32)
Sw(AB) = Sw(A)Sw(B),
A, B ∈SL(2, C),
(12.33)
Sw(A)∗γ0Sw(A) = Sw(A)γ0Sw(A)∗= γ0.
(12.34)
Moreover, the correspondence : A 7→Sw(A) is continuous with
Sw(A)∗= Sw(A∗),
A ∈SL(2, C).
(12.35)
Proof. Throughout the proof, we set S(A) := Sw(A). It is easy to see that
S(A) is invertible with
S(A)−1 =
 A−1 0
0
A∗

.
Hence, by direct computations, we have
S(A)−1γµS(A) =

0
A−1σµ(A∗)−1
A∗σµA
0

,
where σµ := gµνσν (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3). By (12.20), we have
A∗σµA = 1

Tr (σαA∗σµA)σα,
A−1σν(A∗)−1 = 1

By the symmetry of trace, we have
Tr (σαA∗σµA) = Tr (σµAσαA∗) = 2Λ(A)µ
α.
Hence
A∗σµA =
3
X
α=0
Λ(A)µ
νσν.
(12.36)
By (12.25) and the symmetry of trace, we have
Λ(A∗) = tΛ(A).
Hence, replacing A by A∗in (12.36), we obtain
AσµA∗= Λ(A)ν
µσν.
(12.37)
Since A−1 ∈SL(2, C), one can apply (12.37) to A replaced by A−1 to obtain
A−1σν(A∗)−1 = Λ(A−1)α
ν σα = (Λ(A)−1)α
ν σα
= (gtΛ(A)g)α
ν σα = gνλΛ(A)λ
βσβ.
Hence
A−1σµ(A∗)−1 = gµνA−1σν(A∗)−1 = Λ(A)µ
νσν.
Thus we obtain
S(A)−1γµS(A) = Λ(A)µ
νγν.
(12.38)
By direct computations, we have
S(AB) = S(A)S(B),
A, B ∈SL(2, C).
(12.39)
We have
S(A)∗=
A∗
0
0 A−1

= S(A∗).
Hence (12.35) holds and, by direct computations, we obtain (12.34).
It is easy to see that the mapping : A 7→(A∗)−1 is continuous, Hence
S(A) is continuous in A.
Remark 12.5. For a mathematical background behind Lemma 12.8, see
Problem 10.

Lemma 12.8 can be extended as follows:
Lemma 12.9. Let {γµ}µ=0,1,2,3 be any representation of the γ-matrices.
Then there exists an invertible matrix S(A) ∈M4(C) such that
S(A)−1γµS(A) = Λ(A)µ
νγν,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.40)
S(AB) = S(A)S(B),
A, B ∈SL(2, C).
(12.41)
S(A)∗γ0S(A) = γ0.
(12.42)
S(A)γ0S(A)∗= γ0.
(12.43)
Moreover, the correspondence : A 7→S(A) is continuous with
S(A)∗= S(A∗),
A ∈SL(2, C).
(12.44)
Proof. Let {γµ
w}3
µ=0 be the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices. Then,
by Lemma 12.2, there exists a unitary matrix U ∈M4(C) such that
Uγµ
wU −1 = γµ. Let S(A) := USw(A)U −1. Then, by using Lemma 12.8,
one easily sees that S(A) is invertible and satisﬁes (12.40)–(12.43). Formula
(12.44) follows from (12.35).
Lemma 12.9 shows that S(·) : SL(2, C) →GL(C4); A 7→S(A) is a
continuous representation of SL(2, C), implementing each Lorentz transfor-
mation of the γ-matrices: γ = (γµ)3
µ=0 7→Λ(A)γ := (Λ(A)µ
νγν)3
µ=0.
Remark 12.6. A meaning of (12.42) and (12.43) is as follows. One can
deﬁne an indeﬁnite metric ⟨·, ·⟩0 on C4 by
⟨z, w⟩0 :=

z, γ0w

C4 ,
z, w ∈C4.
Equation (12.42) is equivalent to
⟨S(A)z, S(A)w⟩0 = ⟨z, w⟩0 ,
z, w ∈C4,
i.e., S(A) is an invertible linear mapping on C4 which leaves the metric
⟨·, ·⟩0 invariant. Similarly (12.43) shows that S(A)∗leaves the metric ⟨·, ·⟩0
invariant.
Theorem 12.2 and Lemma 12.9 immediately yield the following result:
Corollary 12.1. Let {γµ}3
µ=0 and S(A) be as in Lemma 12.9. For each
(a, A) ∈R4 × SL(2, C) and ψ : M4 →C4, deﬁne ψ(a,A) : M4 →C4 by
ψ(a,A)(x) := S(A)ψ(Λ(A)−1(x −a)),
x ∈M4.
(12.45)
Suppose that ψ is a solution to the free Dirac equation (12.7). Then so is
ψ(a,A).

The set

(12.46)
is a topological group with product operation
(a, A)(b, B) := (a + Λ(A)b, AB),
a, b ∈R4, A, B ∈SL(2, C).
Since SL(2, C) is a universal covering group of L ↑
+, it follows that f
P↑

universal covering group of the 4-dimensional proper Poincar´e group P↑

Let
Map(M4; C4) := {ψ : M4 →C4}

deﬁne a mapping V (a, A) : Map(M4; C4) →Map(M4; C4) by

It is easy to see that {V (a, A)|(a, A) ∈f

Let SFD be the space of solutions to the free Dirac equation (12.7):
SFD := {ψ : M4 →C4|ψ satisﬁes (12.7)}.
(12.49)
Theorem 12.3 (Poincar´e symmetry). For each (a, A) ∈f
P↑

SFD = SFD.
Proof. By Corollary (12.1), V (a, A)SFD ⊂SFD. Conversely, let ψ ∈SFD.
Then, noting that (a, A)−1 ∈f
P↑
+, we see by Corollary (12.1) again that
φ := V ((a.A)−1)ψ ∈SFD. Since V ((a, A)−1) = V (a, A)−1, it follows that
V (a, A)φ = ψ. Hence V (a, A)SFD = SFD.

For two vectors u = (ur)4
r=1, v = (vr)4
r=1 ∈C4 and a 4 × 4 matrix T =

respectively give the free Dirac equation (12.7) and its adjoint form
i∂µψ(x)γµ + Mψ(x) = 0,
(12.50)
where ψ is the 1 × 4 matrix-valued function on M4 deﬁned by
ψ(x) := (ψ1(x)∗, ψ2(x)∗, ψ3(x)∗, ψ4(x)∗)γ0.
Hence the canonical conjugate momentum π(x) = (πr(x))4
r=1 to ψ is given
by
πr := ∂L
∂˙ψr
= iψ∗
r,
r = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(12.51)
where ˙ψ := ∂ψ/∂x0 = ∂ψ/∂t. Therefore the Hamiltonian (energy) density
H (x) takes the form
H (x) :=
4
X
r=1
πr(x) ˙ψr(x) −L (x) = ψ∗(x)(−iααα · ∇+ βM)ψ(x),
where ∇:= (∂1, ∂2, ∂3), α := (α1, α2, α3) (see (12.9) for the deﬁnition of
αj and β) and α · ∇:= P3
j=1 αj∂j. Thus the Hamiltonian is given by
Hcl(t) :=
Z
R3 H (x)dx
=
Z
R3 ψ∗(x)(−iα · ∇+ βM)ψ(x)dx, t = x0,
(12.52)
where we assume that
Z
R3 |ψr(x)|2dx < ∞,
Z
R3 |∂jψr(x)|2dx < ∞, j = 1, 2, 3, r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
If ψ is a solution to (12.7), then, under a suitable condition, Hcl(t) is a
constant independently of t ∈R (Problem 11(i)). Hence the total energy
of the free Dirac ﬁeld is conserved in time.

able condition for the free Dirac ﬁeld ψ, each P j

(Problem 11(ii)).
12.1.7

Making the inner product of (12.8) with ψ∗(x) in C4, we have

∂t
= −i
3
X
j=1
ψ∗(t, x)αj∂jψ(t, x) + Mψ∗(t, x)βψ(t, x).
The complex conjugate of this equation and the Hermiteness of the matrices
αj and β yield

∂t
= i
3
X
j=1
(∂jψ∗(t, x))αjψ(t, x) + Mψ∗(t, x)βψ(t, x).
Hence, letting
ρψ(t, x) := ψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x),
vψ(t, x) := (ψ∗(t, x)α1ψ(t, x), ψ∗(t, x)α2ψ(t, x), ψ∗(t, x)α3ψ(t, x)),
we obtain
∂ρψ(t, x)
∂t
+ div vψ(t, x) = 0.
(12.54)
See also Problem 5.
If one interprets ρψ(t, x) as the density of the matter ﬁeld ψ in the
space R3 and vψ(t, x) as the matter-ﬂow vector ﬁeld, then (12.54) can be
regarded as the continuous equation for the matter ﬁeld. Hence, under a
suitable condition,
Tψ :=
Z
R3 ρψ(t, x)dx
(12.55)
is independent of t, i.e., it is a conserved quantity.
According to the above interpretation for ψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x), it is natural
to identify qψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x) (resp. Mψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x)) with the charge (resp.

12.1.8
Plane wave expansion of the free Dirac ﬁeld
Let us ﬁnd a general form of the free Dirac ﬁeld ψ(t, x). We assume that
ψ(t, ·) is a tempered distribution on R3 obeying (12.7) or (12.8) and that
its Fourier transform in the sense of distribution
ˆψ(t, k) =
1
p
(2π)3
Z
R3 ψ(t, x)e−ik·xdx
(k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3)
is a function on R×R3
k, continuously diﬀerentiable in t ∈R for each k ∈R3.
Considering the Fourier transform of (12.8), we have
id ˆψ(t, k)
dt
= ˆhD(k) ˆψ(t, k),
k ∈R3,
(12.57)
where
ˆhD(k) := α · k + βM,
(12.58)
where α · k := P3
j=1 αjkj. For each k ∈R3, (12.57) is an ordinary linear
diﬀerential equation in t with a matrix coeﬃcient. Hence, if the eigenvalue
problem of the matrix ˆhD(k) is solved, then one can ﬁnd a general solution
to (12.57) so that its inverse Fourier transform will give a general form of
solutions to (12.8). Thus we ﬁrst solve the eigenvalue problem of ˆhD(k).
We introduce a function E on R3 by
E(k) :=
p
k2 + M 2,
k ∈R3.
(12.59)
For each k, E(k) physically denotes the energy of a free Dirac particle of
mass M with momentum k. We deﬁne an M4(C)-valued function UD on
R3 as follows:

Note that UD(0) = I4 for all M ≥0.
Lemma 12.10. For each k ∈R3, UD(k) is a unitary matrix and
UD(k)bhD(k)UD(k)∗= E(k)β.
(12.61)
Proof. It is obvious that (12.61) holds for k = 0. Let k ̸= 0. Then, by
the Hermiteness and the anti-commutativity of αj and β (see (12.11)), we
have
UD(k)∗= M + E(k) −βα · k
p
2E(k)(M + E(k))
.
(12.62)
Hence, by direct computations, we obtain
UD(k)∗UD(k) = 1,
UD(k)UD(k)∗= 1.
Hence UD(k) is unitary. This implies that UD(k)−1 = UD(k)∗. Formula
(12.61) follows from this fact and direct computations.
Let
KM :=
 R3
for M > 0
R3 \ {0} for M = 0 .
(12.63)
Theorem 12.4. For each k ∈KM,
σ(bhD(k) = σp(bhD(k)) = {±E(k)}.
(12.64)
and
dim ker(bhD(k) ± E(k) = 2.
(12.65)
Proof. In the standard representation of the γ-matrices, β (= γ0) is diag-
onalized as shown in Example 12.2 and hence
E(k)β =
 E(k)
0
0
−E(k)

.
(12.66)
This shows that σ(E(k)β) = σp(E(k)β) = {±E(k)} and the multiplicity
of eigenvalues ±E(k) is 2 respectively. By Lemma 12.10 and the unitary
invariance of spectra, the statement of the theorem follows.
The eigenvalue E(k) (resp.
−E(k)) of bhD(k) is called the positive
(resp. negative) energy eigenvalue of bhD(k).
Let
h±(k) := ker(bhD(k) ∓E(k)),
k ∈KM.
(12.67)
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
675
Then it follows from Theorem 12.4 that
h+(k) ⊕h−(k) = C4,
dim h±(k) = 2,
k ∈KM.
(12.68)
Note that, in the case M > 0, h±(0) = ker(β ∓1). We extend this equation
to the case M = 0 for convenience. Then, denoting by P±(k) the orthogonal
projections onto h±(k), we have
P+(k) + P−(k) = I4,
k ∈R3.
(12.69)
Example 12.8. In the standard representation of the γ-matrices, it follows
from Lemma 12.10 and (12.66) that

The matrix
τ := βα1α2α3
(12.70)
is a natural one as a matrix formed out of the matrices αj and β. As is
easily seen, τ is Hermitian and unitary:
τ ∗= τ,
τ 2 = 1.
(12.71)
It follows from (12.11) that
{τ, β} = 0,
{τ, αj} = 0, j = 1, 2, 3.
(12.72)
Example 12.9. In the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices, one has
τ =
0 −i
i 0

.
Let
U+ := ker(β −1),
U−:= ker(β + 1).
(12.73)
Since β is Hermitian, it follows that U+ is orthogonal to U−and
C4 = U+ ⊕U−.
(12.74)
By Example 12.2, we have
dim U± = 2.
It follows from (12.61) that
h±(k) = UD(k)∗U±.
(12.75)
Lemma 12.11. The matrix τ is a unitary transformation from U± onto
U∓.
 

676
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. The ﬁrst anti-commutation relation in (12.72) implies that τU+ ⊂
U−. For any u ∈U−, v := τu is in U+ and τv = u. Hence τU+ = U−.
This fact and the second property in (12.71) imply that τU−= U+.
Theorem 12.5. For all k ∈R3, τh±(k) = h∓(k)
Proof. By (12.72), one has
τˆhD(k) = −ˆhD(k)τ.
(12.76)
This implies that τh±(k) ⊂h∓(k). Since τ 2 = I4, it follows that τh±(k) =
h∓(k).
Theorem 12.5 means that τ transforms the eigenspace of ˆhD(k) with
the positive (resp. negative) energy eigenvalue onto that with the negative
(resp. positive) energy eigenvalue.
In terms of P±(k), a general solution to the diﬀerential equation to
(12.57) is given by
ˆψ(t, k) = e−iE(k)t/P+(k)φ(k) + eiE(k)t/P−(k)φ(k),
(12.77)
where φ(k) ∈C4 is arbitrary. By the inverse Fourier transform, we obtain
a general form of the free Dirac ﬁeld:

tion with positive (resp. negative) energy.

tion in what follows too) and the right hand side denotes the multiplication
operator on L2(R3

applies to other matrix-valued functions too).
Let UD be given by (12.60) and
W := UDF3.
(12.80)
Then, by Lemma 12.10, W is unitary and
WhDW −1 = Eβ.
(12.81)
Since Eβ is self-adjoint on L2(R3
k; C4) and is unitarily equivalent to E ⊕
E ⊕(−E) ⊕(−E), we have
σ(Eβ) = (−∞, −M] ∪[M, ∞),
σp(Eβ) = ∅.
Thus we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 12.6. The free Dirac operator hD is self-adjoint and
σ(hD) = (−∞, −M] ∪[M, ∞),
σp(hD) = ∅.
Remark 12.7. In fact, the spectrum of hD is purely absolutely continuous,
since so is the spectrum of Eβ.

We have
L2(R3; C4) = L2(R3; U+) ⊕L2(R3; U−).
Therefore, letting
D± := W −1L2(R3
k; U±),
(12.82)
we have
L2(R3
x; C4) = D+ ⊕D−.
(12.83)
It follows from (12.81) that hD is reduced by D± and hD is a positive (resp.
negative) operator on D+ (resp. D−).
Example 12.10. In the standard representation of the γ-matrix, U± = C4
±
(see Example 12.8).
In relativistic quantum mechanics, the free Dirac operator hD can be
physically interpreted as the quantum Hamiltonian of a free Dirac particle
of mass M. In this interpretation, D+ (resp. D−) represents the subspace
of positive (resp.
negative) energy states of the Dirac particle.
In this
context, D+ and D−are called the positive energy subspace and the
negative energy subspace of the Dirac particle respectively.

(12.87)
[s1, s2] = is3,
[s2, s3] = is1,
[s3, s1] = is2.
(12.88)
It follows that {s1, s2, s3} is a representation of the Lie algebra su(2, C) of
SU(2) on C4. It turns out that the operator vector
s := (s1, s2, s3)

is physically interpreted as the spin angular momentum of a Dirac
particle.
For each k ∈R3 \ {0}, we introduce a Hermitian matrix:
h(k) := s · ˆk,
(12.90)
where
ˆk := k
|k|.
(12.91)
The matrix h(k) is called the helicity operator of the Dirac particle with
spin angular momentum s. It means the spin component in the direction
of k.

12.1),

Since σ·ˆk is Hermitian and not equal to ±I2, it follows that σp(σ·ˆk) = {±1}
and the multiplicity of the eigevalues ±1 is one respectively. By this fact,
(12.92) and the unitary invariance of spectrum, one obtains (12.93) and
(12.94).
The eigenvalues ±1/2 of h(k) are called the helicities of the Dirac
particle under consideration, which physically mean possible values of the
spin of the Dirac particle in the direction of the momentum k.

Hence it follows that

Therefore h(k) is reduced by the eigenspaces h±(k) of bhD(k). We denote
the reduced parts of it by h±(k):

τh(k) = h(k)τ.
(12.96)
Hence it follows that τ ker(h(k) ± 1/2) = ker(h(k) ± 1/2). This fact and
Theorem 12.5 imply that, for each s = ±1/2, ker(h(k) −s) ∩h+(k) ̸= {0}
if and only if ker(h(k) −s) ∩h−(k) ̸= {0}. Hence (12.95) holds.

Remark 12.8. It follows from Lemma 12.10 that eigenvectors u(k, s) and
v(k, s) are explicitly given as follows:
u(k, s) = UD(k)∗us,
v(k, s) = UD(k)∗vs,
(12.99)
where {us|s = ±1/2} (resp. {vs|s = ±1/2}) is an orthonormal basis of U+
(resp. U−). Hence, if M > 0, then u(k, s) and v(k, s) as functions of k are
inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable on R3. But, in the case M = 0, u(k, s) and v(k, s)
as functions of k are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable only on R3 \ {0}.
The following proposition tells us a physical meaning of the matrix γ5:
Proposition 12.1. The matrix γ5 preserves the helicity of a Dirac particle,
i.e., for all k ∈R3 \ {0} and s = ±1/2, γ5 ker(h(k) −s) = ker(h(k) −s).
Proof. It is easy to see that h(k)γ5 = γ5h(k) (commutativity), which
implies the desired result.
For each k ∈R3, {u(k, s)|s = ±1/2} and {v(k, s)|s = ±1/2} are or-
thonormal bases of h+(k) and h−(k) respectively. Hence we have for all
z ∈C4
P+(k)z =

P−(k)z =

(12.101)
Let {e1, e2, e3, e4} be the standard orthonormal basis of C4: (er)r′ =
δrr′, r, r′ = 1, 2, 3, 4 and deﬁne
P±(k)rr′ := ⟨er, P±(k)er′⟩C4 .
(12.102)
Then, by (12.100) and (12.101), we have
P+(k)rr′ =

ur(k, s)ur′(k, s)∗,
(12.103)
P−(k)rr′ =

(12.104)
Note that (12.69) or (h.4) is equivalent to the following equation:

(12.105)
Applying these formulae to the case z = φ(k) with φ(k) in (12.78) and

12.2
Parities and a Massless Dirac Field
In this section we want to add a remark on the matrix γ5. We denote by
Map(M4, C4) the set of mappings from M4 to C4.
12.2.1
A space-inversion operator
Let ψs be the space-inversion of ψ ∈Map(M4, C4) (see (12.15)) and deﬁne
a mapping Vs on Map(M4, C4) by
Vsψ := ψs.
Then
V 2
s = I,
Vs ̸= ±I.
Hence Vs has eigenvalues ±1 with
ker(Vs ∓1) = {ψ ∈Map(M4, C4)|γ0ψ(Isx) = ±ψ(x), ∀x ∈M4}.
For any ψ ∈Map(M4, C4), one has
ψ = ψ+ + ψ−
with ψ± := (1 ± Vs)ψ/2 ∈ker(Vs ∓1). Hence
Map(M4, C4) = ker(Vs −1) ⊕ker(Vs + 1).
We call Vs the space-inversion operator on Map(M4, C4).
The eigenvalue 1 (resp. −1) of Vs is called the even (resp. odd) parity.
An element of ker(Vs −1) (resp. ker(Vs + 1)) is said to have even (resp.
odd) parity. Since {γ5, γ0} = 0, it follows that
γ5Vs = −Vsγ5.
(12.107)
This means that γ5 ker(Vs ±1) = ker(Vs ∓1), i.e., γ5 transforms a ﬁeld with
even (resp. odd) parity to a ﬁeld with odd (resp. even) parity.

12.2.2
Left-handed and right-handed ﬁelds
Let
PL := 1 −γ5
2
,
PR := 1 + γ5
2
.
Then it is easy to see that PL and PR are orthogonal projections onto
ker(γ5 + 1) and ker(γ5 −1) respectively and
PL + PR = I.
Hence each ψ : M4 →C4 can be decomposed as
ψ = ψL + ψR
with ψL := PLψ and ψR := PRψ.
By (12.107), one has
VsPL = PRVs.
This means that the role of PL and PR exchanges under the transformation
by the space-inversion operator Vs. For this reason, ψL (resp. ψR) is called
the left-handed (resp. right-handed) component of ψ.2
A non-zero mapping ψ ∈Map(M4, C4) is said to be left-handed (resp.
right-handed) if ψR = 0 (resp. ψL = 0).
Proposition 12.2. Suppose that ψ is a free Dirac ﬁeld. Then
iγµ∂µψL −MψR = 0,
iγµ∂µψR −MψL = 0.
(12.108)
Proof. By (12.18), γ5ψ obeys the equation
iγµ∂µγ5ψ + Mγ5ψ = 0.
By subtracting (resp.
adding) this equation from (resp.
to) (12.7), we
obtain the ﬁrst (resp. second) equation in (12.108).
This proposition implies an interesting fact:
Corollary 12.2. There is no left-handed or right-handed massive free Dirac
ﬁeld.
Proof. Let ψ be a massive free Dirac ﬁeld such that ψR = 0. Then, by
the second equation of (12.108), MψL = 0. Since M > 0, ψL = 0. Hence
ψ = 0. Therefore there is no left-handed massive free Dirac ﬁeld. Similarly,
one can show that, if ψL = 0, then ψ = 0.
By this corollary, left-handed or right-handed free Dirac ﬁelds can exist
only in the massless case M = 0. Hence we next consider the massless case.
2Recall that, in R3, the right-handed (resp. left-handed) system is transformed to the
left-handed (resp. right-handed) system under the space-inversion R3 ∋x →−x.

Now we use the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices. Then, by Example
12.6, we have
PL =
 0 0
0 I2

,
PR =
I2 0
0 0

.
Hence ψL and ψR can be written as follows:
ψR =
 φR


,
ψL =
 0
φL

,
φR =
ψ1
ψ2

,
φL =
 ψ3
ψ4

.
We consider the massless free Dirac ﬁeld ψ:
iγµ∂µψ = 0.
Then we have
i ∂
∂tφR = −iσ · DφR,
i ∂
∂tφL = iσ · DφL.
An equation of this type is called a Weyl equation.
We note that, in the massless case M = 0, E(k) = |k|. So suppose that
φR(t, x) = wR(k)e−it|k|+ik·x,
φL(t, x) = wL(k)e−it|k|+ik·x,
(t, x) ∈M4, k ∈R3 \ {0}
with wR, wL : R3 →C2. Then the above equations give
|k|wR(k) = σ · kwR(k),
|k|wL(k) = −σ · kwL(k).
By (12.92), we obtain
h(k) ˜wR(k) = 1
2 ˜wR(k),
h(k) ˜wL(k) = −1
2 ˜wL(k),
where
˜wR(k) :=
 wR(k)
0

∈C4,
˜wL(k) :=

0
wL(k)

∈C4.
Hence, in the massless case, there exist a right-handed ﬁeld ψR with helicity
+1/2 and a left-handed ﬁeld ψL with helicity −1/2.

12.3.1
Deﬁnition of a sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld
We ﬁrst consider a sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld on the 4-dimensional
Minkowski space-time M4. To deﬁne it, we introduce a notation.
For an N-component operator-valued distribution ϕ = (ϕr)N
r=1 on Rd
(N, d ∈N) and f = (fr)N
r=1 ∈⊕NS (Rd), we deﬁne ϕ(f) and Djϕ (j =
1, . . . , d) by
ϕ(f) :=
N
X
r=1
ϕr(fr),
Djϕ = (Djϕr)N

A sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld on M4 is deﬁned as a four com-
ponent sharp-time quantum ﬁeld (ψr(t, ·))4
r=1 on R3 (t ∈R) acting in a
Hilbert space F (see Subsection 8.3.3) such that the following (D.1) and
(D.2) hold:
(D.1) For all f ∈⊕4S (R3), the operator

distribution: for all Ψ ∈D (a common domain of ψr(t, ·)) and f ∈
S (R3), ψr(t, f)Ψ (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) is strongly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R and

with dψr(t, fr)Ψ/dt being the strong derivative of ψr(t, fr)Ψ in t, and,

(D.2) Let πr(t, f) := iψr(t, f)∗, t ∈R, f ∈S (R3) (see (12.51)).
Then
ψr(t, f) and πr(t, f) satisfy the equal-time CAR:
{ψr(t, x), πr′(t, x′)} = iδrr′δ(x −x′),
{ψr(t, x), ψr′(t, x′)} = 0, {πr(t, x), πr′(t, x′)} = 0,
r, r′ = 1, 2, 3, 4, x, x′ ∈R3,
where ψr(t, x) and πr(t, x) denote the operator-valued distribution ker-
nel of ψ(t, ·) and πr(t, ·) respectively: ψr(t, f) =

in the sense of operator-valued distributions (k, k′ ∈R3, s, s′ = ±1/2),

which may be expected to be the operator-valued distribution kernel of a
free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. Indeed, it is easily seen that ψ(t, x) formally sat-
isﬁes the above properties (D.1) and (D.2). With this scheme of heuristics,
we show below that there exists certainly an operator-valued distribution
whose kernel has the form ψ(t, x) given by (12.115).
12.3.3
Rigorous construction
By the heuristic arguments in the preceding subsection, we need only to
show that there exist operator-valued distributions b(·, s) and d(·, s) having
properties (12.110)–(12.113).
For this purpose, we apply the theory of
fermion Fock spaces developed in Chapter 6.
We take the Hilbert space
ˆ
HD := L2(R3
k; C4)
(12.116)
as the one-fermion space and consider the fermion Fock space
FD := Ff( ˆ
HD)
(12.117)
over
ˆ
HD.
We denote by B(f) (f = (f1, f2, f3, f4) ∈
ˆ
HD) the fermion annihilation
operator on FD and, for each f ∈L2(R3
k) and s = ±1/2, we deﬁne bounded
linear operators b(f, s) and d(f, s) on FD as follows:
b(f, 1/2) = B(f, 0, 0, 0),
b(f, −1/2) = B(0, f, 0, 0),
(12.118)
d(f, 1/2) = B(0, 0, f, 0),
d(f, −1/2) = B(0, 0, 0, f).
(12.119)
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
687
The CAR of B(·) and B(·)∗(see Theorem 6.13) imply that, for all f, g ∈
L2(R3
k) and s, s′ = ±1/2,
{b(f, s), b(g, s′)∗} = δss′ ⟨f, g⟩,
(12.120)
{d(f, s), d(g, s′)∗} = δss′ ⟨f, g⟩,
(12.121)
{b(f, s), b(g, s′)} = {d(f, s), d(g, s′)} = 0,
(12.122)
{b(f, s), d(g, s′)} = {b(f, s), d(g, s′)∗} = 0.
(12.123)
In particular, we have
∥b(f, s)#∥= ∥d(f, s)#∥= ∥f∥,
f ∈L2(R3
k).
Hence the mapping : S (R3
k) ∋f 7→b(f ∗, s) (resp.
b(f, s)∗, d(f ∗, s),
d(f, s)∗) is an operator-valued distribution on R3. We denote the operator-
valued distribution kernels of b(f ∗, s) and d(f ∗, s) by b(k, s) and d(k, s)
respectively:
b(f, s) =
Z
R3 b(k, s)f(k)∗dk,
d(f, s) =
Z
R3 d(k, s)f(k)∗dk.
(12.124)
Corresponding to these expressions, we denote the operator-valued distri-
bution kernels of b(f, s)∗and d(f, s)∗by b(k, s)∗and d(k, s)∗respectively.
Then it is easy to see that (12.120)–(12.123) imply (12.110)–(12.113).
Note that, for each helicity s, two kinds of annihilation operator b(·, s)
and d(·, s) appear. Physically speaking, b(·, s) (resp. b(·, s)∗) is the anni-
hilation (resp. creation) operator of a Dirac particle with helicity s and
d(·, s) (resp. d(·, s)∗) is the annihilation (resp. creation) operator of an
anti-Dirac particle with helicity s (see Subsection 12.5 for a justiﬁcation of
this interpretation).
Since ∥u(k, s)∥C4 = 1 and ∥v(k, s)∥C4 = 1 for all k ∈R3 and s = ±1/2,
it follows that
|ur(k, s)| ≤1,
|vr(k, s)| ≤1,
k ∈R3, s = ±1/2, r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Hence, for all f ∈L2(R3
k),
ur(·, s)f, vr(·, s)f ∈L2(R3
k),
r = 1, 2, 3, 4, s = ±1/2.
Therefore, for each f ∈L2(R3
k) and t ∈R, one can deﬁne a bounded linear
operator ψr(t, f) on FD (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) by
ψr(t, f) :=

where ˆf is the 3-dimensional Fourier transform of f and
evr(k, s) := vr(−k, s),
k ∈R3, s = ±1/2.

This is obtained by smearing ψr(t, x) given by (12.115) with f.
The operator

ψr(t, fr),
f ∈⊕4L2(R3)
(12.126)
is a candidate for a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld.
We ﬁrst check if ψ(t, f) obeys the free Dirac equation (12.109).
Theorem 12.7. Let f ∈S (R3). The, for all n ∈N, the operator-valued
function ψr(t, f) (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) is n times uniformly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R.
Moreover, for all f ∈⊕4S (R3),
idψ(t, f)
dt
= −i(α · Dψ)(t, f) + M(βψ)(t, f),
t ∈R,
(12.127)
where dψ(t, f)/dt is the uniform derivative of ψ(t, f) in t.
Proof. It is easy to see that, for all n ∈N, ur(·, s)∗c
f ∗and evr(·, s) ˆf are in
D(En). Hence, by Theorem 6.20, ψr(t, f) is n times uniformly diﬀerentiable
in t ∈R. In particular,
idψr(t, f)

s=±1/2

Hence
idψ(t, f)

We have for all k ∈R3
ˆhD(k)u(k, s) = E(k)u(k, s),
ˆhD(−k)ev(k, s) = −E(k)ev(k, s),
where we have used that E(k) = E(−k). Using these relations and the
Hermiteness of ˆhD(k), we have
Fs(k) =

u(k, s), ˆhD(k)c
f ∗(k)

Using (12.79), we see that

where thD := i P3

(12.129)
Proof. By anti-commutation relations (12.120), (12.121) and (12.123), we
have

follows from (12.122) and (12.123).
As a corollary to Theorem 12.8, we obtain equal-time anti-commutation
relations:
Corollary 12.3. Let f, g ∈L2(R3), t ∈R and r, r′ = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then
{ψr(t, f), ψr′(t, g)∗} = δrr′ ⟨g, f⟩,
(12.130)
{ψr(t, f), ψr′(t, g)} = 0, {ψr(t, f)∗, ψr′(t, g)∗} = 0.
(12.131)
Proof. Formula (12.130) follows from (12.128) and (12.105), while (12.131)
is just a special case of (12.129).
Corollary 12.4. For all f ∈L2(R3), t ∈R and r = 1, 2, 3, 4,
∥ψr(t, f)#∥≤∥f∥.
(12.132)
Proof. By (12.130), we have for all Ψ ∈FD
∥ψr(t, f)Ψ∥2 + ∥ψr(t, f)∗Ψ∥2 = ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence ∥ψr(t, f)#Ψ∥≤∥f∥∥Ψ∥. Hence (12.132) follows.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By Theorem 12.7 and Corollary 12.3, we can conclude that ψ(t, f) (f ∈
⊕4S (R3)) is a sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of mass M.
Let
ψD(t, f) := ψ(t, f ∗),
f ∈⊕4S (R3).
Then ψD(t, f) is anti-linear in f.
Theorem 12.9. For each t ∈R,
πt := (FD, {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)})
(12.133)
is an irreducible representation of the CAR over ⊕4S (R3).
Proof. Corollary 12.3 implies that {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}
obeys the CAR over ⊕4S (R3).
We next prove the irreducibility of {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}.
Let T ∈{ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}′. For each ˆf ∈C∞
0 (R3
k \ {0}),
we deﬁne
f (+)
s
:= F −1
3
u(·, s) ˆf, f (−)
s
:= F −1
3
v(·, s)eˆf, s = ±1
2.
By Remark 12.8, f (±)
s
are in ⊕4S (R3) for all M ≥0. By (12.126) and
(12.125), we have
ψD(t, f (+)
1/2 ) = B(eiEt ˆf, 0, 0, 0), ψD(t, f (+)
−1/2) = B(0, eiEt ˆf, 0, 0),
ψD(t, f (−)
1/2 ) = B(0, 0, eiEt( ˆf)∗, 0)∗, ψD(t, f (−)
−1/2) = B(0, 0, 0, eiEt( ˆf)∗)∗.
Hence, introducing Dt := {eiEt ˆf| ˆf
∈C∞
0 (Rk \ {0})}, one has that
T ∈{B(F), B(F)∗|F ∈⊕4Dt}′.
It is easy to see that ⊕4Dt is dense
in
ˆ
HD.
Therefore, by Theorem 6.22, T = αI for some α ∈C.
Thus
{ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)} is irreducible.

The free quantum Dirac ﬁeld smeared over the whole

For C4-valued functions g, h on R3
k, we deﬁne a function ⟨g, h⟩on R3
k by
⟨g, h⟩(k) := ⟨g(k), h(k)⟩C4 ,
k ∈R3.

Anti-commutation relations at diﬀerent space-time
points and microscopic causality
In this subsection, we derive an explicit formula for the right hand side of
(12.128) and show that the microscopic causality holds for the free quantum
Dirac ﬁeld.
Lemma 12.14. For all k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3,
P+(k) = (γµkµ + M)γ0
2E(k)

(12.136)
P−(k) = γ0(γµkµ −M)
2E(k)

(12.137)
where k0 := E(k) and kj := −kj, j = 1, 2, 3.
Proof. The orthogonal projection onto the eigenspace U+ (resp. U−) of
β is given by (1 ± β)2. Hence, by (12.61), we have

Then, using αj = γ0γj, β = γ0 and αjβ = −βαj, we obtain (12.136) and

We denote by

b(f, s)Φ0 = 0,
d(f, s)Φ0 = 0,

(12.144)

Hamiltonian and Momentum Operator of the Free
Quantum Dirac Field
For a linear operator A on L2(R3
k), the direct sum operator ⊕4A on
ˆ
HD
will be denoted by A simply.
The fermion second quantization of the multiplication operator E
HD := dΓf(E)
(12.146)
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on FD. It follows from Theorem
6.18 and (12.125) that
ψr(t, f) = eitHDψr(0, f)e−itHD,
f ∈L2(R3). r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
(12.147)
By Theorem 12.9 and Proposition 8.2, HD can be interpreted as the Hamil-
tonian of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of mass M up to constant
additions.
Theorem 12.11. Let πt be given by (12.133). Then, for each pair (t, s) ∈
R2, πt is equivalent to πs.
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
695
Proof. By (12.147), we have
ψr(t, f) = ei(t−s)HDψr(f)e−i(t−s)HD.
Hence {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f
∈
⊕4S (R3)} is unitarily equivalent to
{ψD(s, f), ψD(s, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}. Therefore πt is equivalent to πs.
The fermion second quantization of the multiplication operator kj (j =
1, 2, 3)
PD,j := dΓD(kj)
(12.148)
is also self-adjoint. The triple
PD := (P 1
D, P 2
D, P 3
D)
(P j
D := −PD,j, j = 1, 2, 3)
(12.149)
is strongly commuting. It is easy to see that, for all a = (a1, a2, a3) ∈R3,
f ∈L2(R3) and r = 1, 2, 3, 4,
ψr(t, fa)
= eia1PD,1eia2PD,2eia3PD,3ψr(t, f)e−ia1PD,1e−ia2PD,2e−ia3PD,3
(12.150)
Hence PD can be interpreted as the momentum operator of the free
quantum Dirac ﬁeld.
Remark 12.9. Let us brieﬂy look at classical-quantum correspondence in
the theory of a free Dirac ﬁeld. Let Hformal be the formal operator which is
obtained by replacing the classical ﬁeld ψ(x) in the classical Hamiltonian
Hcl (see (12.52)) with the symbolical (heuristic) expression (12.115) of the
free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. Then formal manipulations give
Hformal =
X
s=±1/2
Z
R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) −d(k, s)d(k, s)∗},
where the manipulations has to be made without changing the order of the
creation and annihilation operators. Using the CAR for d(k, s), we have
Hformal =
X
s=±1/2
Z
R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) + d(k, s)∗d(k, s)}
−2δ(0)
Z
R3 dkE(k),
a mathematically meaningless expression, since the last term is divergent.
On the other hand, by applying Theorem 6.19(i), we have
HD =
X

n=1
b(en, s)∗b(Een, s) +
X
s=±1/2

696
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
on ∧ﬁn(D(E)), where {en}∞
n=1 ⊂D(E) is a CONS of L2(R3).
Using
(12.124) and the relation
∞
X
n=1
en(k)en(k′)∗= δ(k −k′)
in the sense of distribution, we obtain a symbolical expression for HD:
HD =
X
s=±1/2
Z
R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) + d(k, s)∗d(k, s)}.
This is just Hformal without the divergent term −2δ(0) R
R3 dkE(k). Hence
a proper form of the Hamiltonian of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld can be
found by an “inﬁnite renormalization” of Hformal.
Note that the CAR
of d(k, s)# plays an essential role to ensure that the Hamiltonian af-
ter the renormalization is bounded from below; if d(k, s) and d(k, s)∗
obeyed the CCR [d(k, s), d(k′, s′)∗] = δ(k −k′)δss′, then we would have
H′
D := P
s=±1/2
R
R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) −d(k, s)∗d(k, s)} as a renor-
malized Hamiltonian. It is easy to see that H′
D is a symbolical expression
of a well-deﬁned operator, i.e.,
H′
D = dΓf(E ⊕E ⊕(−E) ⊕(−E)).
But this operator is neither bounded from below nor bounded from above.
Hence H′
D is not suitable as a Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld system which
should be bounded from below.
It turns out that, in terms of the ﬁeld ψ(x), HD is formally written as
HD =
Z
R3 : ψ(x)∗(−iααα · ∇+ βM)ψ(x) : dx,
where : · : denotes Wick product for the Dirac ﬁeld deﬁned as follows:
: A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2) := A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2),
: B(k2, s2)A(k1, s1)∗:= −A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2),
: A(k1, s1)B(k2, s2) := A(k1, s1)B(k2, s2),
: A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2)∗:= A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2)∗,
for A, B = b or d and : (X+Y )(X′+Y ′) :
def
= : XX′ : + : XY ′ : + : Y X′ : + :
Y Y ′ :. Hence, heuristically, the inﬁnite renormalization mentioned above
corresponds to taking the Wick product in the Hamiltonian density.

12.5
Total Charge Operator
Corresponding to the classical total charge Qcl given by(12.56), the total
charge of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld ψ(t, x) may be heuristically of the
form
Qformal = q
Z
R3 : ψ(0, x)∗ψ(0, x) : dx
= q
X
s=±1/2
Z
R3 (b(k, s)∗b(k, s) −d(k, s)∗d(k, s)) dk.
This suggests the following rigorous deﬁnition for the total charge operator
QD of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld:
QD := qdΓf(I ⊕(−I)),
(12.152)
where I ⊕(−I) is the operator on
ˆ
HD deﬁned by
(I ⊕(−I))f = (f1, f2, −f3, −f4),
f = (fr)4
r=1 ∈HD.
It is obvious that QD is self-adjoint and strongly commutes with HD and
PD,j (j = 1, 2, 3).
Introducing operators
N+ := dΓf(I ⊕0),
N−:= dΓf(0 ⊕I),
(12.153)
we have
QD = q(N+ −N−)
(12.154)
on D(N+) ∩D(N−).
Let n, m ≥0, fj, gℓ∈L2(R3), sj, tℓ= ±1/2 (j = 1, . . . , n, ℓ= 1, . . . , m)
and
Ψ(n,m) := b(f1, s1)∗· · · b(fn, sn)∗d(g1, t1)∗· · · d(gm, tm)∗Φ0.
Then we have
N+Ψ(n.m) = nΨ(n,m),
N−Ψ(n,m) = mΨ(n,m).
Hence
QDΨ(n,m) = q(n −m)Ψ(n,m).
Therefore Ψ(n,m) can be interpreted as a state vector consisting of n Dirac
particles and m anti-Dirac particles (note that the charge of an anti-Dirac
particle is −q). The operator N+ (resp. N−) counts the number of Dirac
(resp. anti-Dirac) particles in the state Ψ(n,m). Hence N+ (resp. N−) is
called the number operator for Dirac (resp. anti-Dirac) particles.

The one-particle space
ˆ
HD = L2(R3
k; C4) has the obvious orthogonal
decomposition
ˆ
HD =
ˆ
HD+ ⊕HD−,
ˆ
HD+ := L2(R3
k; C2),
ˆ
HD−:= L2(R3
k; C2).
According to the deﬁnition of b(·, s)# and d(·, s)#, the Hilbert space
ˆ
HD+
(resp.
ˆ
HD−) is interpreted as the Hilbert space for one Dirac (resp. anti-
Dirac) particle in the momentum representation. By the isomorphism the-
orem (Theorem 6.21), FD is isomorphic to Ff( ˆ
HD+) ⊗Ff(HD−).
We
denote this isomorphism by U. Let Nf := dΓf(I) be the fermion number
operator on Ff(L2(R3
k; C2)) and
N +
f
:= Nf ⊗I,
N −
f
:= I ⊗Nf.
(12.155)
Then
UN±U −1 = N ±
f
and hence
UQDU −1 = q(N +
f −N −
f )
(12.156)
on ∧0( ˆ
HD+)ˆ⊗∧0 ( ˆ
HD−).
Note that
Ff( ˆ
HD+) ⊗Ff( ˆ
HD−) = ⊕n,m≥0Fn,m,
where
Fn,m := ∧n( ˆ
HD+) ⊗∧m( ˆ
HD−).
We have
(N +
f −N −
f )Ψ = (n −m)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fn,m.
Hence, for each z ∈Z,
Hz := U −1 (⊕n,m≥0,n−m=zFn,m)
is the eigenspace of QD with eigenvalue qz:
Hz = ker(QD −qz).
(12.157)
It follows that
FD = ⊕z∈ZHz.
(12.158)
Thus FD is decomposed into the inﬁnite direct sum of the closed subspaces
with diﬀerent charges. Since HD strongly commutes with QD, it follows
that, for all t ∈R, e−itHD leaves each Hz invariant. This is a more detailed
statement of the charge conservation law in the system of the free quantum
Dirac ﬁeld.
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field

12.6
Poincar´e Covariance
In this section, we prove the relativistic covariance of the free quantum
Dirac ﬁeld.
Theorem 12.12. Let S(A) be as in Lemma 12.9.
Then there exists a
strongly continuous unitary representation {U(a, A)|(a, A) ∈f
P↑
+} of the
group f
P↑
+ such that, for all (a, A) ∈f
P↑
+ and f ∈⊕4S (R4),
U(a, A)Φ0 = Φ0
(12.159)
and
U(a, A)ψ(f)U(a, A)−1 = S(A)−1ψ(f(a,Λ(A))),
(12.160)
where f(a,Λ(A)) : = ((fr)(a,Λ(A)))4
r=1.
We prove this theorem by constructing U(a, A) explicitly. We ﬁrst de-
scribe a basic idea for that.
Let f ∈⊕4S (R4). Then, by (12.134) and the deﬁnition of b(·)# and
d(·)#, we have
ψ(f) = B(K+f ∗) + B(K−f)∗,
(12.161)
where
K+g := (u(·, 1/2)∗FEg, u(·, −1/2)∗FEg, 0, 0),
(12.162)
K−g := (0, 0, ˜v(·, 1/2)FEg, ˜v(·, −1/2)FEg), g ∈L2(R4
x; C4).
(12.163)
For notational simplicity, we set S := S(A)−1 and Λ := Λ(A). Then
Sψ(f(a,Λ)) = ψ(tSf(a,Λ)) = B(K+S∗f ∗
(a,Λ)) + B(K−
tSf(a,Λ))∗.
(12.164)
Hence, recalling Theorem 6.17, one needs only to show that there exists a
strongly continuous unitary representation {Y (a, A)|(a, A) ∈
˜
P↑
+} on
ˆ
HD
such that, for all (a, A) ∈˜
P↑
+ and g ∈
ˆ
HD,
Y (a, A)K+g = K+S∗g(a,Λ),
Y (a, A)K−g = K−tSg(a,Λ).
(12.165)
Then U(a, A) := Γf(Y (a, A)) gives the desired unitary representation.
We now proceed to showing the existence of such an operator Y (a, A).
In what follows, S(A) is assumed to be the one given in Theorem 12.12.
Lemma 12.15. For all g ∈L2(R4
x; C4),
∥K+S∗g(a,Λ)∥2 = ∥K+g∥2,
(12.166)
∥K−tSg(a,Λ)∥2 = ∥K−g∥2.
(12.167)

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. By (12.103) and (12.104), we have
∥K+g∥2 =
Z
R3 ⟨(FEg)(k), P+(k)(FEg)(k)⟩C4 dk,
∥K−g∥2 =
Z
R3

(FEg)(k), tP−(−k)(FEg)(k)

C4 dk.
Note that, in the second equation, the transposed matrix tP−(−k) appears.
It is easy to see that
(FEg(a,Λ))(k) = ei˜ka(FEg)(kΛ),
where ˜k := (E(k), k) and kΛ := ((Λ−1˜k)1, (Λ−1˜k)2, (Λ−1˜k)3). Hence
∥K+S∗g(a,Λ)∥2 =
Z
R3 ⟨(FEg)(kΛ), SP+(k)S∗(FEg)(kΛ)⟩C4 dk, (12.168)
∥K−tSg(a,Λ)∥2 =
Z
R3

(FEg)(kΛ), StP−(−k)tS(FEg)(kΛ)

C4 dk
=
Z
R3

(FEg)(kΛ), t(SP−(−k)S∗)(FEg)(kΛ)

C4 dk.
By (12.136) and (12.42), we have
SP+(k)S∗= (SγµS−1kµ + M)γ0
2E(k)
.
By (12.40), we have
SγµS−1kµ = Λµ
νγνkµ = (Λ−1˜k)µγµ.
By this fact and the Lorentz invariance of the measure dk/E(k), we see
that the right hand side of (12.168) is equal to
Z
R3 ⟨(FEg)(k), P+(k)(FEg)(k)⟩C4 dk = ∥K+g∥2.
Hence (12.166) holds.
By (12.137) and (12.42) we have
SP−(k)S∗= γ0(SγµS−1kµ −M)
2E(k)
.
Hence, in the same way as in the case of SP+(k)S∗, we have
Z
R3

(FEg)(kΛ), t(SP−(−k)S∗)(FEg)(kΛ)

C4 dk
=
Z
R3

(FEg)(k), tP−(−k)(FEg)(k)

C4 dk.
Thus (12.167) is obtained.
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field

Let
D0 := {K+g + K−f|g, f ∈⊕4S (R4
x)}.
Then it is easy to see that D0 is a subspace of
ˆ
HD.
Lemma 12.16. The subspace D0 is dense in
ˆ
HD.
Proof. Let G
=
(Gr)4
r=1
∈
D⊥
0 .
The, for all f, g
∈
⊕4S (R4),
⟨G, (K+g + K−f)⟩= 0.
In particular, considering the case f = 0 and
g = 0 respectively, we have ⟨G, K+g⟩= 0 and ⟨G, K−f⟩= 0 respectively.
Hence
⟨w+, FEg⟩= 0,
⟨w−, FEf⟩= 0,
where
w+ := G1u(·, 1/2) + G2u(·, −1/2), w−:= G3˜v(·, 1/2)∗+ G4˜v(·, −1/2)∗.
In the same way as in the proof of Lemma 10.9, one can show that {FEg|g ∈
⊕4S (R4)} is dense in
ˆ
HD.
Hence w± = 0.
Since, for each k ∈R3,
{u(k, s), v(k, s)|s = ±1/2} is a basis of C4, it follows that Gr = 0, r =
1, 2, 3, 4. Hence G = 0. Thus D0 is dense in
ˆ
HD.
For each (a, A) ∈
˜
P↑
+, we deﬁne a linear operator on
ˆ
HD as follows:
D(Y (a, A)) := D0,
Y (a, A)(K+g + K−f) := K+S∗g(a,Λ) + K−tSf(a,Λ), K+g + K−f ∈D0.
By Lemma 12.15, Y (a, A) is well-deﬁned (i.e., if K+g + K−f = K+g′ +
K−f ′ ∈D0, then K+S∗g(a,Λ) + K−tSf(a,Λ) = K+S∗g′
(a,Λ) + K−tSf ′
(a,Λ))
and
∥Y (a, A)(K+g + K−f)∥2 = ∥K+S∗g(a,Λ)∥2 + ∥K−tSf(a,Λ)∥2
= ∥K+g∥2 + ∥K−f∥2
= ∥K+g + K−f∥2.
Hence Y (a, A) is a densely deﬁned isometric operator. Therefore, by the
extension theorem, Y (a, A) has a unique extension as an everywhere deﬁned
isometric operator on
ˆ
HD. We denote it by the same symbol Y (a, A).
Lemma 12.17. The mapping Y :
˜
P↑
+ ∋(a, A) 7→Y (a, A) is a strongly
continuous unitary representation of P↑
+.
 

702
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. For each (a, A) ∈˜
P↑
+, we deﬁne
η(a, A)g := g(a,Λ(A)),
g ∈L2(R4; C4).
Then it is easy to see that η(·) is a strongly continuous unitary representa-
tion of
˜
P↑
+ on L2(R4; C4). We have
Y (a, A)K+g = K+S(A−1)∗η(a, A)g, g ∈⊕4S (R4).
Hence, for all (a, A), (b, B) ∈
˜
P↑
+.
Y (a, A)Y (b, B)K+g = Y (a, A)K+S(B−1)∗η(b, B)g
= K+S(A−1)∗η(a, A)(S(B−1)∗η(b, B)g)
= K+S(A−1)∗S(B−1)∗η(a, A)η(b, B)g
= K+S((AB)−1)∗η((a, A)(b, B))g
= Y ((a, A)(b, B))K+g.
Similarly one ca show that
Y (a, A)Y (b, B)K−f = Y ((a, A)(b, B))K−f,
f ∈L2(R3; C4).
Hence Y (a, A)Y (b, B) = Y ((a, A)(b, B)) on D0. Since D0 is dense and Y (·)
is bounded, it follows that Y (a, A)Y (b, B) = Y ((a, A)(b, B)). In particular,
this implies that Y (a, A) is surjective. Thus Y (a, A) is unitary. The strong
continuity of Y (a, A) in (a, A) is easily proved.
Lemma 12.17 shows that Y (·) is the desired representation of ˜
P↑
+. Thus
Theorem 12.12 is proved.
Remark 12.10. Formula (12.160) is symbolically written in terms of the
operator-valued distribution kernel ψr(x) of ψr(f) (f ∈S (R4)) as follows:
U(a, A)ψr(x)U(a, A)−1 =
4
X
r′=1
(S(A)−1)rr′ψr′(Λ(A)x + a).
Remark 12.11. A free quantum Dirac ﬁeld can be constructed in a man-
ifestly covariant way. See, e.g., [Bogoliubov et al. (1975), Chapter 2, §4]
and [Dimock (2011), Chapter 8].
12.7
The Free Quantum Dirac Field with Momentum
Cutoﬀ
As in the case of a free quantum scalar ﬁeld and the free quantum radiation
ﬁeld, one can deﬁne a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀ.
 

Free Quantum Dirac Field
703
Let g be a real-valued function in L2(R3
k) and, for each x ∈R3
x, deﬁne
gx ∈L2(R3
k) by
gx(k) :=
1
p
(2π)3 g(k)e−ik·x,
a.e.k ∈R3
k.
For r = 1, 2, 3, 4, we deﬁne an operator-valued function ψg
r : M4 →B(FD)
by
ψg
r(t, x) :=
X
s=±1/2
{b(eitEur(·, s)∗gx, s) + d(eitE˜v(·, s)gx, s)∗},
(12.169)
and set
ψg(t, x) := (ψg
r(t, x))4
r=1.
(12.170)
Note that
ψg(t, x) = ψ(t, ˇgx),
(12.171)
where, for h ∈L2(R3
k), ˇh is the inverse Fourier transform of h: ˇh := F −1
3
h.
By Corollary 12.4, we have
∥ψg
r(t, x)∥≤
1
p
(2π)3 ∥g∥.
(12.172)
Theorem 12.13. Let g ∈D(E) and x = (t, x) ∈M4.
Then ψg(x) is
uniformly diﬀerentiable in xµ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) and satisﬁes the Dirac equation
(iγµ∂µ −M)ψg(x) = 0.
(12.173)
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 12.7.
We call ψg(x) the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cut-
oﬀg.
Corollary 12.5. Let g ∈D(E) and
Jµ
g (x) := ψg(x)∗γ0γµψg(x),
x ∈M4.
Then Jµ
g (x) is uniformly diﬀerentiable in xµ and
∂µJµ
g (x) = 0.
(12.174)
Proof. By Theorem 12.13, Jg(x) is uniformly diﬀerentiable in xµ and
∂µJµ
g (x) = (∂µψg(x)∗)γ0γµψg(x) + ψg(x)∗γ0γµ∂µψg(x).
By (12.173), we have
γµ∂µψg(x) = −iMψg(x).
Taking the adjoint of the both sides and using the basic properties of the
γ-matrices and γ0(γµ)∗γ0 = γµ, we obtain
∂µψg(x)∗γ0γµ = iMψg(x)∗γ0.
Hence (12.174) follows.
 

704
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Equation (12.174) shows the conservation of the vector current Jg =
(Jµ
g )3
µ=0 of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀ.
The time-zero cutoﬀﬁeld ψg(0, x) can be used to make operators de-
scribing interactions of Dirac ﬁelds.
12.8
PCT Theorem
Finally let us have a quick look at the PCT theorem in the theory of the
free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. In our formulation, the charge conjugation on
the one-particle level, which means the exchange of a particle state and
an anti-particle state, is described by the anti-unitary operator uD on
ˆ
HD
deﬁned by
uD(f1, f2, f3, f4) := (f ∗
3 , f ∗
4 , f ∗
1 , f ∗
2 ),
(f1, f2, f3, f4) ∈
ˆ
HD.
It follows that
u2
D = I,
u−1
D = uD.
Hence the Γ-operator
ΘD := Γf(uD)
is anti-unitary on Ff( ˆ
HD) with
Θ2
D = I.
It is easy to see that, for all f ∈L2(R3
k), s = ±1/2,
ΘDb(f, s)#Θ−1
D = d(f ∗, s)#, ΘDd(f, s)#Θ−1
D = b(f ∗, s)#.
For simplicity, we work with the standard representation of the γ-
matrices (see Example 12.2). In this case, we have
β =
I2
0
0 −I2

αj =
 0 σj
σj 0

.
Hence
u1/2 =




1
0




,
u−1/2 =

v−1/2 =

Hence the matrix

Free Quantum Dirac Field

relates us (vs) to vs (us) by
Cus = vs,
Cvs = us,
s = ±1/2.
It is easy to see that
C∗= C,
C2 = I4,
C−1 = C.
We have
CβC−1 = −β,
CαjC−1 = αj,
j = 1, 2, 3.
Hence
CUD(k)∗C−1 = UD(−k)∗,
k ∈R3.
Therefore, by (12.99), we obtain
Cu(k, s) = ˜v(k, s),
C˜v(k, s) = u(k, s).
Now let f ∈⊕4S (R4) and ˜f(x) := f(I0Isx) = f(−x), x ∈R4. Then
ψ(C ˜f)∗= b

Thus we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 12.14 (PCT theorem for the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld).
For all f ∈⊕4S (R4),
ΘDψ(f)Θ−1
D = ψ(C ˜f)∗.
12.9
Notes
By Theorem 12.11, one has πt ∼= π0 for all t ∈R. The representation πt
depends on the mass M ≥0; let us write πt = π(M)
t
. Then the following
fact is proved [Arai (2017)]: if M1 ̸= M2 (M1, M2 ≥0), then π(M1)
0
is
inequivalent to π(M2)
0
. This may be the counterpart of the property of the
time-zero quantum scalar ﬁelds stated in Remark 10.1. Thus the masses
of Dirac particle are prameters indexing a family of mutually inequivalent
irreducible representations of CAR. As in the case of the quantum scalar
ﬁeld, there is a general structure behind the fact. See [Arai (2017)] for the
details.

Chapter 13
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
A model of a quantum scalar ﬁeld interacting with a ﬁxed external source is
analyzed in detail.
13.1
Introduction
We have constructed a free quantum scalar ﬁeld in Chapter 10. But this
model describes no interactions of elementary particles. In this chapter, we
construct a model of a quantum scalar ﬁeld interacting with a ﬁxed external
ﬁeld (source). This model is one of the simplest interacting models in QFT,
but it serves as a prototypical model in QFT in the sense that it exhibits
interesting features of models in QFT. For a comprehensive understanding
of the model, we ﬁrst look at the classical ﬁeld version of it. Throughout
this chapter, we use the physical unit system where c = 1 and ℏ= 1.
Let ̺ be a real tempered distribution on Rd and consider the partial
diﬀerential equation
(□+ m2)ϕ(x) = ̺(x),
x = (t, x) ∈R × Rd
(13.1)
for a real scalar ﬁeld ϕ : R1+d →R.
Physically the distribution ̺ is
interpreted as a given static source or a given static external ﬁeld (“static”
means “time independent”) and ϕ is a scalar ﬁeld generated by ̺ obeying
(13.1). The case d = 3 is the physical case in the conventional sense.
The Lagrangian which leads to the ﬁeld equation is given by

where π = ∂tϕ. As is easily seen, Hcl is independent of t (Problem 2).
Namely the total energy of the ﬁeld is conserved. Hence Hcl is written in
terms of time-zero ﬁelds ϕ(0, x) and π(0, x):
Hcl(t) = Hcl(0)

(13.3)
This model describes an interaction between a classical scalar ﬁeld and
a classical source. But it has no relativistic symmetry, i.e., it is a non-
relativistic model (Problem 1).
The quantum ﬁeld theoretical version of the above classical ﬁeld model
with ̺ ̸= 0 is called the ﬁxed source model or the van Hove–Miyatake
(vHM) model with mass m and source ̺ [van Hove (1952); Miyatake
(1952a,b)] (usually this model is called the van Hove model).
In the context of classical ﬁeld theory with d = 3, the tempered distri-
bution ̺ denotes the density of the distribution of nucleons in the space R3
and ϕ is the ﬁeld of the nuclear force that ̺ generates. According to the
meson theory by Hideki Yukawa, the nuclear force comes from the exchange
of mesons. Hence, in quantum theory, the ﬁeld of nuclear force is described
by the quantum meson ﬁeld.
Example 13.1. Suppose that N nucleons are ﬁxed at points x1, . . . , xN ∈
Rd, where xj ̸= xℓfor j ̸= ℓ. Then the distribution density of the nucleons
is given by
̺(p)(x) :=
N
X
n=1
λnδd(x −xn),
(13.4)
where each λn ∈R \ {0} is a constant and δd(x) is the d-dimensional delta
distribution. This type of source is called a point source.
The point source ̺(p) can be approximated by an extended source as
follows. Let vn be a real-valued Lebesgue integrable function on Rd such

that
R
Rd vn(x)dx = 1 and, for κ > 0, deﬁne
̺v,κ(x) :=
N
X
n=1
λnκdvn(κ(x −xn)).
(13.5)
Then, by Example D.6 in Appendix D, we have
lim
κ→∞̺v,κ(x) = ̺(p)(x)
in S ′(Rd).
We refer the reader to [Henley and Thirring (1962), Chapter 9] for
further physical discussions of the model.
13.2
A Realization of the vHM Model
As mentioned above, the classical Hamiltonian Hcl(t) is independent of time
t. Hence the Hamiltonian of the corresponding quantum ﬁeld model may
be deﬁned by replacing ϕ(0, x) and π(0, x) in Hcl(0) with the time-zero
ﬁelds of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld. This is a basic idea for the
construction of the vHM model given below.
We take the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) over L2(Rd
k) as the Hilbert
space for the vHM model to be constructed.
We assume that the real
tempered distribution ̺ satisﬁes the condition
̺ ∈H−1/2
ω,R (Rd)
(13.6)
(see (10.9)) and deﬁne the Hamiltonian of the model by
H̺ := H0 −φ0(̺),
(13.7)
where
H0 := Hb = dΓb(ω),
the Hamiltonian of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld (see Section 10.2 and
(10.14)), and φ0(·) is deﬁned by (10.15).1 As suggested above, the time-zero
ﬁeld and its conjugate momentum in the formulation under consideration
are taken respectively to be φ0(f) (f ∈SR(Rd)) and π0(f) deﬁned by
(10.16). We call (H̺, {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}) with ̺ ̸= 0 the concrete
vHM model based on the representation {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} of
1By the reality of ̺, φ0(̺) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).

the Heisenberg CCR over SR(Rd). We remark that the above class of ̺
does not contain the point source ̺(p) (Problem 3), since
b̺(p)(k) =
1

n=1
λne−ik·xn,
k ∈Rd.
As is seen, H̺ is an example of an operator which is obtained by per-
turbing a boson second quantization operator by a Segal ﬁeld operator.
Hence H̺ has an abstract version.
Generally speaking, in the case where a physical concrete model has
an abstract version, it is better to consider the abstract version.
This
approach makes it possible to understand what are general and what are
special in the model and hence may bring a deeper and wider cognition
for the model under consideration. With this philosophy, in what follows,
we deﬁne the abstract version of the concrete vHM model and analyze it
in detail.
Properties of the concrete vHM model are derived as simple
applications of theorems on the abstract vHM model.
Before giving the deﬁnition of the abstract vHM model, we ﬁrst intro-
duce a general concept of abstract quantum ﬁeld models.
13.3
General Concept of Quantum Field Models in the
Canonical Formalism in QFT
In general, a quantum ﬁeld model in the canonical formalism in QFT is
deﬁned by a triple M = (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) consisting of a self-
adjoint operator H on a Hilbert space F and an irreducible self-adjoint
representation (F, D, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) (on F) of the Heisenberg CCR
over a real inner product space W with the interpretation that H is the
Hamiltonian of the model, φ(f) is the time-zero ﬁeld and π(f) is the time-
zero conjugate momentum. The time-t ﬁelds (t ∈R) are deﬁned by
φ(t, f) := eitHφ(f)e−itH,
π(t, f) := eitHπ(f)e−itH.
There may be many quantum ﬁeld models based on irreducible self-
adjoint representations of the Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product
space W .
Hence it is natural to classify them into equivalent ones and
inequivalent ones. For this purpose, we introduce a concept of equivalence
of quantum ﬁeld models.
Deﬁnition 13.1. Two quantum ﬁeld models M := (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈
W }) and M′ := (F ′, H′, {φ′(f), π′(f)|f ∈W }) are said to be equivalent
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
715
if there exist a unitary operator U : F →F ′ and a real constant E such
that UHU −1 = H′ + E (cf. Proposition 8.1) and
Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f), Uπ(f)U −1 = π′(f),
f ∈W .
In this case we write M ∼= M′.
Remark 13.1. It is obvious that M ∼= M and that, if M ∼= M′, then M′ ∼= M.
Moreover, it is easy to see that, if three quantum ﬁeld models M1, M2 and
M3 satisfy M1 ∼= M2 and M2 ∼= M3, then M1 ∼= M3. Therefore the relation
∼= in the set of quantum ﬁeld models is certainly an equivalence relation.
Thus the above deﬁnition is meaningful.
As is seen, the concept of equivalence deﬁned above is stronger than
the equivalence of the two representations (F, D, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) and
(F ′, D′, {φ′(f), π′(f)|f ∈W }) of the Heisenberg CCR over W .
Also it
should be kept in mind that only the unitary equivalence of the Hamiltoni-
ans up to constant additions does not imply the equivalence of the models.
A quantum ﬁeld model M = (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f
∈W }) is said
to be regular if H is bounded from below and has a unique ground
state Ω(∥Ω∥
=
1) with property Ω
∈
∩∞
n=1 ∩(t1,f1),...,(tn,fn)∈R×W
D(X(t1, f1) · · · X(tn, fn)), where X = φ or π.
Proposition 13.1. Let M = (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) and M′ =
(F ′, H′, {φ′(f), π′(f)|f ∈W }) be regular quantum ﬁeld models. Suppose
that they are equivalent.
Then, for all n ∈N and (tj, fj) ∈R × W
(j = 1, . . . , n),
⟨Ω, X(t1, f1) · · · X(tn, fn)Ω⟩= ⟨Ω′, X′(t1, f1) · · · X′(tn, fn)Ω′⟩,
(13.8)
where Ω′ is a ground state of the model M′ with ∥Ω′∥= 1.
Proof. By the present assumption, there exist a unitary operator U : F →
F ′ and a real constant E such that UHU −1 = H′ + E · · · (∗) and
Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f), Uπ(f)U −1 = π′(f),
f ∈W .
By (∗), E0(H) = E0(H′) + E (recall that E0(A) := inf σ(A) for a self-
adjoint operator A). Since H′Ω′ = E0(H′)Ω′, it follows that HU −1Ω′ =
E0(H)U −1Ω′. Hence U −1Ω′ is a ground state of H. Hence U −1Ω′ = αΩ
for some α ∈C with |α| = 1.
 

716
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Now let L be the left hand side of (13.8). Then
L =

U −1Ω′, X(t1, f1) · · · X(tn, fn)U −1Ω′
=

Ω′, (Ueit1HU −1)(UX(f1)U −1)(Uei(t2−t1)HU −1)(UX(f2)U −1) · · ·
× (Uei(tn−tn−1)HU −1)(UX(fn)U −1)(Ue−itnHU −1)Ω′

.
We have UeisHU −1 = eis(H′+E) (s ∈R) and UX(fj)U −1 = X′(fj). Hence
L is equal to the right hand side of (13.8).
Proposition 13.1 gives a suﬃcient condition for two regular quantum
ﬁeld models to be inequivalent:
Corollary 13.1. Let M and M′ be regular quantum ﬁeld models. Suppose
that there exist an n ∈N and (t1, f1), . . . , (tn, fn) ∈R×W such that (13.8)
does not hold. Then M is inequivalent to M′.
13.4
Deﬁnition of the Abstract vHM Model
Let H be a complex Hilbert space and Fb(H ) be the boson Fock space
over H (see Chapter 5). We carry over the notation in Chapter 5.
Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on H and,
for each g ∈H \ {0}, deﬁne
HT (g) := dΓb(T ) + ΦS(g).
(13.9)
This is an abstract version of H̺ (the case of HT (g) with H = L2(Rd
k),
T = ω and g = −b̺/√ω gives H̺).
From a perturbation theoretical point of view (see Remark 7.10), HT (g)
is viewed as the perturbation of dΓb(T ) by ΦS(g) and it may be better to
introduce a perturbation parameter λ ∈R by replacing g with λg so
that HT (g) takes the form
H(λ) := HT (λg) = dΓb(T ) + λΦS(g).
(13.10)
The parameter λ is also called the coupling constant. The reader should
keep in mind this point of view in what follows, although the presentation
below is non-perturbative in the sense that no restriction is given to the
strength |λ| of the coupling parameter (in the standard perturbation theory,
it is usual that |λ| must be suﬃciently small).
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
717
It is easy to see that HT (g) is a symmetric operator with D(HT (g)) ⊃
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). From quantum theoretical point of view, it should be exam-
ined if HT (g) is self-adjoint or essentially self-adjoint. We ﬁrst consider this
problem.
Lemma 13.1. Let K be a Hilbert space, A be a non-negative self-adjoint
operator on K and B be a symmetric operator on K such that D(A1/2) ⊂
D(B) and, for all Ψ ∈D(A1/2),
∥BΨ∥≤c∥A1/2Ψ∥+ d∥Ψ∥,
where c ≥0 and d ≥0 are constants. Then:
(i) A + B is self-adjoint with D(A + B) = D(A), bounded from below and
essentially self-adjoint on any core of A.
(ii) For all Ψ ∈D(A) and ε ∈(0, 1),
∥AΨ∥≤
1
1 −ε∥(A + B)Ψ∥+
1
1 −ε
 c2
4ε + d

∥Ψ∥.
(13.11)
(iii) Let M be a real constant such that A + B + M ≥0. Then, for all
Ψ ∈D((A+ B + M)1/2) and ε ∈(0, 1), it holds that Ψ ∈D(A1/2) and
∥A1/2Ψ∥2 ≤
1
1 −ε∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 +
1
1 −ε
 c2
4ε + d −M

∥Ψ∥2.
(13.12)
(iv) D(A1/2) = D((A + B + M)1/2).
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
∥A1/2Ψ∥≤∥Ψ∥1/2∥AΨ∥1/2.
Using the inequality (5.55), we have for any ε > 0
c∥A1/2Ψ∥≤ε∥AΨ∥+ c2
4ε∥Ψ∥.
Hence
∥BΨ∥≤ε∥AΨ∥+
 c2
4ε + d

∥Ψ∥.
Let 0 < ε < 1. Then we can apply the Kato-Rellich theorem (Theorem
1.14) to conclude that the A + B is self-adjoint with D(A + B) = D(A),
bounded from below and essentially self-adjoint on any core of A.
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then
∥AΨ∥≤∥(A + B)Ψ∥+ ∥BΨ∥
≤∥(A + B)Ψ∥+ ε∥AΨ∥+
 c2
4ε + d

∥Ψ∥.
 

718
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence (13.11) follows.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then
∥A1/2Ψ∥2 = ⟨Ψ, (A + B + M)Ψ⟩−⟨Ψ, BΨ⟩−M∥Ψ∥2
≤∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥Ψ∥∥BΨ∥−M∥Ψ∥2

 c2
4ε + d −M

∥Ψ∥2.
Hence (13.12) with Ψ ∈D(A) holds. Since D(A) = D(A + B + M) is a
core of (A + B + M)1/2, (13.12) with Ψ ∈D((A + B + M)1/2) follows from
a limiting argument.
(iv) It follows from (iii) that D((A + B + M)1/2) ⊂D(A1/2). On the
other hand, for all Ψ ∈D(A),
∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 = ⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩+ ⟨Ψ, BΨ⟩+ M∥Ψ∥2
≤∥A1/2Ψ∥2 + (c∥A1/2Ψ∥+ d∥Ψ∥)∥Ψ∥+ M∥Ψ∥2
≤(1 + ε)∥A1/2Ψ∥2 +
 c2
4ε + d + M

∥Ψ∥2,
where ε > 0 is arbitrary. Since D(A) is a core of A1/2, the above inequality
extends to all Ψ ∈D(A1/2) through a limiting argument, implying that
D(A1/2) ⊂D((A + B + M)1/2).
In what follows, we assume the following:
g ∈D(T −1/2).
(13.13)
Theorem
13.1. Assume (13.13).
Then HT (g) is self-adjoint with
D(HT (g)) = D(dΓb(T )) and bounded from below. Moreover, any core of
dΓb(T ) is a core of HT (g) and, for all M ∈R such that HT (g) + M ≥0,
D((HT (g) + M)1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2).
Proof. By
Proposition
5.12,
D(dΓb(T )1/2)
⊂
D(ΦS(g)).
Hence
D(HT (g)) = D(dΓb(T )). Moreover, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2),
∥ΦS(g)Ψ∥≤
√
2∥T −1/2g∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥+ ∥g∥
√
2 ∥Ψ∥.
(13.14)
Hence we can apply Lemma 13.1 to the case where A = dΓb(T ) and B =
ΦS(g) to obtain the desired results.
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
719
By Theorem 13.1, the lowest energy
ET (g) := E0(HT (g)) = inf σ(HT (g))
(13.15)
is ﬁnite. Hence
bHT (g) := HT (g) −ET (g)
(13.16)
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator. By Theorem 13.1, one has
D( bHT (g)1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2).
In what follows, we assume that there exists a conjugation C on H
such that
CT ⊂T C.
(13.17)
Let HC, φF(f) and πF(f) (f ∈HC) be as in Section 5.12.
Then, by
Theorem 5.26, {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈HC} is an irreducible representation (on
Fb(H )) of the Heisenberg CCR over HC. For each real number s ≥0, we
deﬁne
Ds(T ) := D(T −s) ∩D(T s) ∩HC,
which is dense in HC.
Lemma 13.2. For each s ≥0, {eiφF(T −sf), eiπF(T sf) | f ∈Ds(T )} is
an irreducible Weyl representation over Ds(T ). In particular, {φF(T −sf),
πF(T sf) | f ∈Ds(T )} is an irreducible representation of the Heisenberg
CCR over Ds(T ).
Proof. Apply Theorem 5.44 with T replaced by T s.
By Theorem 13.1 and Lemma 13.2, for each g ∈D(T −1/2), we can
deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld model by the triple (Fb(H ), HT (g), {φF(T −1/2f),
πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈D1/2(T )}). We call the model with g ̸= 0 the abstract
vHM model with the pair (T, g).
If g = 0, then HT (g) = dΓb(T ). We call the triple (Fb(H ), dΓb(T ),
{φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f) |f ∈D1/2(T )}) the abstract free Bose ﬁeld
theory with one-particle Hamiltonian T (see (5.14)).
The following theorem shows that the abstract vHM model is non-
trivial.
Theorem 13.2. The abstract vHM model with the pair (T, g) is inequiva-
lent to the abstract free Bose ﬁeld theory (Fb(H ), dΓb(T ), {φF(T −1/2f),
πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈D1/2(T )}).

Proof. Suppose that they were equivalent.
Then there exist a unitary
operator U on Fb(H ) and a real constant E such that UHT (g)U −1 =
dΓb(T ) + E and, for all f ∈D1/2(T ),
UφF(T −1/2f)U −1 = φF(T −1/2f),
UπF(T 1/2f)U −1 = πF(T 1/2f).
The last two operator equations imply that, for all f ∈D1/2(T ),
UφF(T −1/2f) ⊂φF(T −1/2f)U,
UπF(T 1/2f) ⊂πF(T 1/2f)U.
Hence, by Lemma 13.2, U = cI for some c ∈C. Hence HT (g) = dΓb(T )+E,
implying that ΦS(g) = E. But, since g ̸= 0, ΦS(g) is not a scalar operator.
Thus we arrive at a contradiction.
In fact, the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to any free Bose ﬁeld
theory under suitable conditions. We prove this later (see Theorem 13.13).
13.5
The Heisenberg Fields
The Heisenberg operators of φF(T −1/2f) and πF(T 1/2f) with respect to
HT (g) (see Section 5.16) are deﬁned by
Φ(t, f) := eitHT (g)φF(T −1/2f)e−itHT (g),
(13.18)
Π(t, f) := eitHT (g)πF(T 1/2f)e−itHT (g),
t ∈R, f ∈D1/2(T ).
(13.19)
We call Φ(t, f) the Heisenberg ﬁeld of the abstract vHM model
and Π(t, f) its conjugate ﬁeld. Let us derive diﬀerential equations they
obey. For this purpose, we prove a general fact on strong diﬀerentiability
of Heisenberg operators in t.
Lemma 13.3. Let K be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator
on K . Let A be a linear operator on K satisfying the following (i)–(iii):
(i) For some constant α > 0, D(|H|α) ⊂D(A) and, for all Ψ ∈D(|H|α),
∥AΨ∥≤c∥|H|αΨ∥+ d∥Ψ∥,
where c and d are non-negative constants.
(ii) AD(|H|α+1) ⊂D(H).
(iii) There exists a subspace D ⊂D(|H|α+1) such that, for all t ∈R,
Ae−itHD ⊂D(H).
Let
A(t) := eitHAe−itH,
t ∈R,
the Heisenberg operator of A with respect to H. Then, for all Ψ ∈D, A(t)Ψ
is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
d
dtA(t)Ψ = ieitH[H, A]e−itHΨ.
(13.20)
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model

Remark 13.2. By the functional calculus, we have that, for all β > 0 and
t ∈R, e−itHD(|H|β) = D(|H|β).
Hence the right hand side of (13.20)
is well-deﬁned.
Equation (13.20) is written in the form of Heisenberg
equation:
d
dtA(t)Ψ = i[H, A(t)]Ψ
Hence the assumption of Lemma 13.3 gives a suﬃcient condition for A(t)
to satisfy the Heisenberg equation with respect to H.
Proof. Let t ∈R and Ψ ∈D be ﬁxed. For all s ∈R \ {0}, we have
A(t + s)Ψ −A(t)Ψ

(13.21)
We estimate each term on the right hand side.
It follows from the functional calculus that, for any Borel measurable
function f on Rd and β > 0,
|H|βf(H)Ψ = f(H)|H|βΨ,
Ψ ∈D(|H|βf(H)) ∩D(f(H)|H|β).
Using this fact and condition (i), we have

Similarly one can show that the third term on the right hand side of (13.21)
tends to 0 as s →0. The second term on the right hand side of (13.21)
converges to −ieitHAHe−itHΨ as s →0. Thus the desired result follows.

√
2 (A(T f)∗−A(T f)) + iIm ⟨g, f⟩
holds on D( bHT (g)3/2).
Proof. By (13.14), we can apply Lemma 13.1 to the case where A =
dΓb(T ), B = ΦS(g), c =
√
2∥T −1/2g∥and d = ∥g∥/
√
2.
Hence part (i)
follows from (iii) in Lemma 13.1.
Concerning part (ii), we proceed as follows. For notational simplicity,
we set H := bHT (g) and H0 := dΓb(T ). Let f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2) and
Ψ ∈D(H3/2). Then D(H) = D(H0) ⊂D(A(f)#). Using Theorem 5.17(i),
we see that, for all η ∈D(H),
⟨Hη, A(f)Ψ⟩= ⟨A(f)∗η, HΨ⟩−⟨η, A(T f)Ψ⟩
+ ⟨ΦS(g)η, A(f)Ψ⟩−⟨A(f)∗η, ΦS(g)Ψ⟩.
Since A(f)Ψ and ΦS(g)Ψ are in D(H0), we have
⟨ΦS(g)η, A(f)Ψ⟩−⟨A(f)∗η, ΦS(g)Ψ⟩= ⟨η, [ΦS(g), A(f)]Ψ⟩= −1
√

⟨f, g⟩.
Also note that HΨ ∈D(H1/2) = D(H1/2

⟨η, A(f)HΨ⟩. Therefore
⟨Hη, A(f)Ψ⟩= ⟨η, A(f)HΨ⟩−

Thus the statement for A(f) in part (ii) holds. Similarly one can prove the
statement for A(f)∗.
Part (iii) immediately follows from (ii).
Field equations for (Φ(t, f), Π(t, f)) are given in the next theorem:
Theorem 13.3. Let f ∈HC ∩D(T 3/2) ∩D(T −1/2). Then, for any Ψ ∈

(13.24)
Proof. Throughout the proof, we set H := bHT (g). By (13.22) and the
dΓb(T )1/2)-boundedness of ΦS(f) with f ∈D(T −1/2), there exist positive
constants c1 and c2 such that
∥ΦS(f)Ψ∥≤c1∥H1/2Ψ∥+ c2∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H1/2), f ∈D(T −1/2).
By this fact and Lemma 13.4, we can apply Lemma 13.3 to the case where
A = ΦS(T −1/2f), α = 1/2 and D = D(H3/2). Hence, for all Ψ ∈D(H3/2),
Φ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and, by Lemma 13.4(iv),

Thus (13.24) holds.

Spectral Properties of HT (g) (I)—The Case g
∈
D(T −1)
As we see below, spectral properties of HT (g) depend on the regularity of
g with respect to T (i.e., the property of which D(T α) (α ∈R) the vector
g belongs to). We ﬁrst discuss the case where g ∈D(T −1). A basic idea to
analyze spectral properties of HT (g) is to make a unitary transformation
of HT (g) to bring it to a simpler form.
Lemma 13.5. Let f ∈D(T ). Then the operator equality
eiΦS(if)dΓb(T )e−iΦS(if) = HT (T f) + 1
2 ⟨f, T f⟩
(13.25)
holds. In particular,
eiΦS(if)Nbe−iΦS(if) = Nb + ΦS(f) + ∥f∥2
2
,
f ∈H ,
(13.26)
where Nb is the boson number operator on Fb(H ).
Remark 13.4. By the functional calculus, condition f ∈D(T ) implies that
T f ∈D(T −1/2). Hence, by Theorem 13.1, HT (T f) (the case g = T f) is
self-adjoint on D(dΓb(T )) and essentially self-adjoint on any core of dΓb(T ).
Proof. Let f ∈D(T ) and Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) (n ∈N). Then, by (5.99),
e−iΦS(if)Ψ =
∞
X
n=0
(−i)nΦS(if)nΨ
n!
.
Since Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )), it follows that, for all n ∈N, ΦS(if)nΨ ∈
D(dΓb(T )).
To show that e−iΦS(if)Ψ is in D(dΓb(T )), we estimate
∥dΓb(T )ΦS(if)nΨ∥.
We note that, for all elements A, B in an algebra, the following identities
hold:
ABn = [A, B]Bn−1 + B[A, B]Bn−2 + · · ·
+ Bn−2[A, B]B + Bn−1[A, B] + BnA
=
n
X
j=1
Bj−1[A, B]Bn−j + BnA.
(13.27)
By Theorem 5.17(ii), we have
[dΓb(T ), ΦS(if)]Ψ = iΦS(T f)Ψ.
(13.28)
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
725
Hence, by applying (13.27) to the case where A = dΓb(T ) and B = ΦS(if),
we obtain
dΓb(T )ΦS(if)nΨ =
n

j=1
ΦS(if)j−1iΦS(T f)ΦS(if)n−jΨ

Since D(T ) is a core of T , Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core of dΓb(T ). Hence, by
Theorem 13.1, Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core of HT (T f). Therefore vector equation
(13.29) implies the operator equality (13.25). Taking T = I in (13.25), we
obtain (13.26).
Let
E(T, g) := −1
2∥T −1/2g∥2 ≤0.
(13.30)
Theorem 13.4. Suppose that
g ∈D(T −1).
(13.31)
Then:
(i) The operator equality
e−iΦS(iT −1g)HT (g)eiΦS(iT −1g) = dΓb(T ) + E(T, g)
(13.32)
holds.
(ii) (spectral properties)
σ(HT (g)) = σ(dΓb(T )) + E(T, g),
(13.33)
σp(HT (g)) = σp(dΓb(T )) + E(T, g),
(13.34)
where, for a subset D ⊂R and a ∈R, D + a := {x + a|x ∈D}.
Moreover, for each eigenvalue E ∈σp(dΓb(T )), the multiplicity of E
is the same as that of E + E(T, g) ∈σp(HT (g)).
(iii) If σp(T ) = ∅, then
σp(HT (g)) = {E(T, g)}.
(iv) (existence and uniqueness of ground states) The Hamiltonian HT (g)
has a unique ground state given by
ΩT (g) := eiΦS(iT −1g)ΩH
(13.35)
up to constant multiples, where ΩH is the Fock vacuum in Fb(H ),
and
ET(g) = E(T, g).
(13.36)
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
727
Namely, ΩT (g) ∈D(HT (g)) and
HT (g)ΩT (g) = ET (g)ΩT (g).
(13.37)
Moreover, ΩT (λg) is a vector-valued analytic function in λ ∈R and,
for all λ ∈R,
ΩT (λg) =

Remark 13.5. By the functional calculus, for all s ∈(0, 1), D(T −1) ⊂
D(T −s). Hence, under condition (13.31), condition (13.13) is automatically
satisﬁed.
Remark 13.6. Since σ(dΓb(T )) and σp(dΓb(T )) are known in Theorem
5.3, Theorem 13.4(ii) completely clariﬁes the structure of the spectrum and
the point spectrum of HT (g) with g ∈D(T −1).
Proof. (i) By taking f = T −1g in Lemma 13.5, we obtain (13.32).
(ii) This part follows from (i) and the unitary invariance of the spectra
of a linear operator.
(iii) This follows from (13.34) and that σp(dΓb(T )) = {0} in the case
where σp(T ) = ∅(see (5.9)).
(iv) By (13.32) and the non-negativity of dΓb(T ), we have HT (g) ≥
E(T, g). Since dΓb(T )ΩH = 0, (13.32) implies (13.37) with (13.36). Hence
ΩT (g) is a ground state of HT (g). Since ΩH is the unique ground state of
dΓb(T ) up to constant multiples, it follows that ΩT (g) is a unique ground
state of HT (g).
Formula (13.38) is due to that ΩH is an entire analytic vector for Φ(f)
(f ∈H ).
We want to give some remarks on Theorem 13.4 from perturbation
theoretical points of view.
(1) We ﬁrst consider the case where T is strictly positive, i.e., T ≥m for
some constant m > 0. In this case, T −1 is everywhere deﬁned bounded
operator with ∥T −1∥≤1/m. Hence condition (13.31) automatically
satisﬁed. By Theorem 5.3, inf σ(dΓb(T )) \ {0} ≥m > 0. Hence 0
is a simple isolated eigenvalue of dΓb(T ). As already seen, ΦS(g) is
relatively bounded with respect to dΓb(T ). Hence one can apply the
analytic perturbation theory ([Kato (1976), Chapter 7]; [Reed and Si-
mon (1978), Chapter XII]) to the self-adjoint operator H(λ) deﬁned
 

728
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
by (13.10) to conclude that there exists a constant r0 > 0 such that,
for all |λ| < r0, H(λ) has a simple eigenvalue E(λ) analytic in λ with
E(0) = 0 and there exists an eigenvector Ω(λ) ∈ker(H(λ) −E(λ))
which is analytic in λ. Moreover, it is shown by an application of a
general theorem ([Arai (2006b), Theorem 5.20]) that Ω(λ) is a ground
state of H(λ). Thus, in the case where T is strictly positive, the ex-
istence of a ground state of H(λ) is shown by an application of the
standard analytic perturbation theory, but, the strength |λ| of the cou-
pling constant λ is restricted. Theorem 13.4(iv) shows that, in fact,
H(λ) has a unique ground state for all λ ∈R and the ground state is
analytic in λ. We also note that ground state energy with g replaced
by λg is given by
ET (λg) = −λ2
2 ∥T −1/2g∥2,
which is obviously analytic in λ.
(2) We next consider the case where T is not strictly positive, i.e., 0 ∈σ(T ).
In this case, 0 is not an isolated point of σ(T )2 and T −1 is unbounded
(Problem 4).
Hence it is non-trivial if g ∈D(T −1).
By Theorem
5.3, in the present case, 0 ∈σp(dΓb(T )) is not an isolated eigenvalue.
Hence one can not apply the standard analytic perturbation theory to
H(λ) (in the standard analytic perturbation theory, an eigenvalue of
the unperturbed operator A in question must be an isolated eigenvalue
of A with a ﬁnite multiplicity). Theorem 13.4(iv) shows that, in this
case too, H(λ) has a ground state analytic in λ ∈R and the ground
state energy also is analytic in λ ∈R if g ∈D(T −1).
(3) As a typical case of T in (2), let us consider the case where σ(T ) =
[0, ∞). Then, by Theorem 5.3, we have
σ(dΓb(T )) = [0, ∞).
Hence, in this case, the eigenvalue 0 of the unperturbed operator
dΓb(T ) is an embedded eigenvalue of dΓb(T ). Generally speaking, it is
very subtle if an embedded eigenvalue is stable under a perturbation.
Theorem 13.4(iv) shows that, if g ∈D(T −1), then 0 ∈σp(dΓb(T )) is
stable under the perturbation ΦS(g). But, if g ̸∈D(T −1), then it is
unstable, i.e., it disappears under the perturbation (see Theorem 13.7
below).
2If 0 is an isolated point of σ(T), then 0 is an eigenvalue of T and hence T is not
injective, but this contradicts the original assumption.

Spectral Properties of HT (g) (II)—The Case g
̸∈
D(T −1)
We next consider the case where (13.31) does not hold:
g ̸∈D(T −1).
(13.39)
In this case, the method of the preceding section cannot be used, since
Φ(iT −1g) is not deﬁned. Spectral analysis of HT (g) under condition (13.39)
becomes more complicated as is seen below.
We ﬁrst remark that the situation (13.39) is possible only if the lowest
energy E0(T ) = inf σ(T ) of T is equal to zero:
E0(T ) = 0,
(13.40)
because, if E0(T ) > 0, then 0 ∈̺(T ) (recall that σ(T ) ⊂[E0(T ), ∞)) and
hence T −1 is bounded with D(T −1) = H so that g ∈D(T −1) contradicting
(13.39). Moreover 0 is not an isolated point of σ(T ) (if 0 is an isolated point
of σ(T ), then it is an eigenvalue of T , contradicting the injectivity of T ).
Hence inf(σ(T ) \ {0}) = 0.
13.7.1
Spectrum of HT (g)
The following theorem shows that the spectrum of HT (g) itself is indepen-
dent of whether g is in D(T −1) or not (cf. Theorem 13.4(ii)).
Theorem 13.5. Assume (13.13) and (13.39). Then
σ(HT (g)) = σ(dΓb(T )) + E(T, g).
Proof. For a Borel set B, we denote the characteristic function of B by
χB and consider the operator χB(T ) deﬁned by the functional calculus. It
follows that χB(T ) = ET (B), where ET is the spectral measure of T . For
a > 0, we deﬁne ga ∈H by
ga := χ[a,∞)(T )g.

We have

λ2 d∥ET (λ)g∥2 ≤1
a2 ∥ET ([a, ∞))g∥2 < ∞.
Hence
ga ∈D(T −1).

Hence one can apply the results in the preceding section with g replaced
by ga. Therefore we introduce an operator
Ha := HT (ga)
(13.42)
and
bHa := Ha −E(T, ga).
(13.43)
Let
Ua := e−iΦS(iT −1ga).
Then, by Lemma 13.5, we have
Ua bHaU −1
a
= dΓb(T ).
(13.44)
Now let λ ∈σ(dΓb(T )). Then, by a general theorem on the spectrum
of a self-adjoint operator, there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(dΓb(T ))
such that ∥Ψn∥= 1 and limn→∞∥(dΓb(T ) −λ)Ψn∥= 0. Let
Φn,a := U −1
a Ψn.
Then ∥Φn,a∥= 1 and
lim
n→∞( bHa −λ)Φn,a = 0.
(13.45)
For notational simplicity, we set H := HT (g) and E0 = E(T, g). Note
that
H −E0 −λ = bHa −λ + ΦS(ha) −E(T, ha),
where ha := χ[0,a)(T )g ∈D(T −1/2). Hence
∥(H −E0 −λ)Φn,a∥≤∥( bHa −λ)Φn,a∥
+ ∥ΦS(ha)Φn,a∥+ |E(T, ha))|.
Using Theorem 5.28, we have

Hence, for any m ∈N, there exists a constant am > 0 such that
∥T −1/2ham∥< 1
m, ∥ham∥< 1
m, |E(T, ham)| < 1
m.
By (13.45), there exists a constant nm ∈N such that
∥( bHam −λ)Φnm,am∥< 1

Therefore we obtain
∥(H −E0 −λ)Φnm,am∥≤C1
m ,
where C1 is a constant independent of m. Hence
lim
m→∞∥(H −E0 −λ)Φnm,am∥= 0.
Therefore λ ∈σ(H −E0). Thus
σ(dΓb(T )) + E0 ⊂σ(H).
(13.46)
To show that the converse inclusion relation of (13.46) holds, let λ ∈
σ(H −E0). We note that, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )),
lim
a→0
bHaΨ = (H −E0)Ψ.
Since D(dΓb(T )) is a common core of Ha, it follows from a general theorem
[Reed and Simon (1980), Theorem VIII.25-(a)] that bHa converges to H−E0
in the strong resolvent sense. Hence, by a general theorem again [Reed
and Simon (1980), Theorem VIII.24-(a)], there exist a real sequence {ak}k
converging to 0 and λk ∈σ( bHak) such that limk→∞λk = λ.
On the other hand, by Theorem 13.4(ii), σ( bHak) = σ(dΓb(T )). Hence
λk ∈σ(dΓb(T )). By this fact and the closedness of σ(dΓb(T )), we conclude
that λ ∈σ(dΓb(T )). Thus σ(dΓb(T )) + E0 ⊃σ(H).

Absence of eigenvalues of HT (g)
We next examine if HT (g) has an eigenvalue. Of course this may depend
on properties of T and g. As preliminaries, we prove some facts.
Lemma 13.6. Let K be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator on
K . Let X(t) (t ∈R) be a densely deﬁned linear operator on K satisfying
the following conditions:
(X.1)For each t ∈R, D(H) ⊂D(X(t)) ∩D(X(t)∗) and, for all Ψ ∈
D(H), the vector-valued functions X(t)e−itHΨ and X(t)∗Ψ are strongly
continuous in t ∈R.
(X.2) The operator X(t) is weakly diﬀerentiable on D(H), i.e., there
exists a linear operator X′(t) such that D(X′(t)) ⊃D(H) and, for all
Φ, Ψ ∈D(H), ⟨Φ, X(t)Ψ⟩is diﬀerentiable in t with
d
dt ⟨Φ, X(t)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, X′(t)Ψ⟩.
Then, for all Φ, Ψ ∈D(H), the function
u(t) :=

is diﬀerentiable and

Remark 13.7. By the functional calculus, e−itHD(H) = D(H), ∀t ∈R.
Hence eitHX(t)e−itHΨ (Ψ ∈D(H)) is well-deﬁned.
Proof. Let Φ(t) := e−itHΦ and Ψ(t) := e−itHΨ (t ∈R). For any s ∈
R, s ̸= 0, we have e−i(t+s)H = e−isHe−itH. Hence

Lemma 13.7. Let f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )).
(i) The vector-valued function A(e−itT f)#Ψ is strongly continuous in
t ∈R.
(ii) The vector-valued function A(e−itT f)#e−itHT (g)Ψ is strongly continu-

By the functional calculus, we have (e−isT −1)f(t) ∈D(T −1/2). Hence, by
Theorem 5.16,
∥F(t + s) −F(t)∥≤∥T −1/2(e−isT −1)f(t)∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥.
By the functional calculus again,
∥T −1/2(e−isT −1)f(t)∥= ∥(e−isT −1)T −1/2f(t)∥
→0
(s →0).
Hence lims→0 F(t + s) = F(t). Thus F(t) is strongly continuous in t ∈R.
Similarly one can prove the strong continuity of A(e−itT f)∗Ψ in t ∈R.
(ii) We set H = HT (g). Let G(t) := A(e−itT f)e−itHΨ and Ψ(t) :=
e−itHΨ. Then
G(t + s) −G(t) = [A(e−isT f(t)) −A(f(t))]Ψ(t)

Ψ(t) = 0.
Therefore lims→0 G(t + s) = G(t). Thus G(t) is strongly continuous in t.
Similarly one can prove the strong continuity of A(e−itT f)∗e−itHΨ in t.

Theorem 13.6.
(i) For all t ∈R, f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2),
eitHT (g)C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψ = C(eitT f)Ψ,
(13.50)
eitHT (g)C(f)∗e−itHT (g)Ψ = C(eitT f)∗Ψ.

(ii) Let g ∈D(T −1). Then, for all t ∈R and f ∈D(T −1/2),
C(f)ΩT (g) = 0.
(13.52)
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst consider the case where f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2). Let
Ψ, Φ ∈D(HT (g))[= D(dΓb(T ))] and
v(t) :=
D
Φ, eitHT (g)C(e−itT f)e−itHT (g)Ψ

By Theorem 5.17(i) and the CCR for A(·)#, the right hand side is equal to
zero. Hence v(t) = v(0) = ⟨Φ, C(f)Ψ⟩. Therefore
eitHT (g)C(e−itT f)e−itHT (g)Ψ = C(f)Ψ.
Note that e−itT D(T −1/2) = D(T −1/2). Replacing e−itT f by f, we obtain
(13.50). Since D(T )∩D(T −1/2) is a core for T −1/2, it follows from a limiting
argument that (13.50) extends to the case f ∈D(T −1/2).
We next extend (13.50) to the case Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2). Since D(dΓb(T ))
is a core of dΓb(T )1/2, there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D(dΓb(T )) such
that
Ψn →Ψ,
dΓb(T )1/2Ψn →dΓb(T )1/2Ψ (n →∞).
By the preceding result, we have
C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψn = e−itHT (g)C(eitT f)Ψn.
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
735
Using Theorem 5.16, we see that {C(eitT f)Ψn}n is a Cauchy sequence. By
the closedness of C(f), limn→∞C(eitT f)Ψn = C(eitT f)Ψ. Hence
C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψn →e−itHT (g)C(eitT f)Ψ (n →∞).
It is obvious that e−itHT (g)Ψn →e−itHT (g)Ψ (n →∞). Hence e−itHT (g)Ψ ∈
D(C(f)) and C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψ = e−itHT (g)C(eitT f)Ψ. Thus (13.50) holds.
Formula
(13.51)
can
be

by
considering
the

of
(13.50).
In that case, note that D(|HT (g)|1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2) and
e−itHT (g)D(dΓb(T )1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2).
(ii) By Theorem 5.28, we have
C(f) = eiΦS(iT −1g)A(f)e−iΦS(iT −1g).
By this fact and (13.35), we obtain (13.52).
Theorem 13.7. Assume (13.13), (13.39) and that T is absolutely continu-
ous. Then HT (g) has no eigenvectors. In particular, HT (g) has no ground
states.
Remark 13.8. This theorem shows that, under the present assumption,
the formal perturbation theory breaks down for the ground state of dΓb(T ).
Proof. We prove the theorem by reductio ad absurdum. So suppose that
HT (g) had an eigenvalue E ∈R and ΨE = {Ψ(n)
E }∞
n=0 ̸= 0 is an eigenvector:
HT (g)ΨE = EΨE. Then, by Theorem 13.6,
eit(HT (g)−E)C(f)ΨE = C(eitT f)ΨE.
Hence
∥C(f)ΨE∥= ∥C(eitT f)ΨE∥.
By Lemma 8.7 and Theorem C.2 in Appendix C, the right hand side con-
verges to 0 as t →∞. Hence C(f)ΨE = 0. This implies that
A(f)ΨE = −1

Hence F : D(T −1/2) →C is a contimuous linear functional. Since D(T −1/2)
is dense in H , F extends uniquely to a continuous linear functional on
H . Hence, by Riesz’s representation theorem, there exists a unique vector

2u/cn. But this contradicts (13.39).
Remark 13.9. It is well-known that, even if the spectrum of a linear op-
erator A on a Hilbert space conicides with that of a linear operator B on
a Hilbert space, they are not necessarily unitarily equivalent. Theorems
13.7 and 13.5 imply that the pair (HT (g), dΓb(T ) + E(T, g)) is an example
of such pair (A, B) of linear operators. Note that, in this case, the abso-
lute continuity of T and domain property (13.39) are crucial (see the next
theorem).
Theorems 13.4 and 13.7 lead one to the following interesting fact:
Theorem 13.8. Assume (13.13) and that T is absolutely continuous. Then
HT (g) has no ground states if and only if (13.39) holds.
We now consider physical meaning of the absence of ground states as
stated in Theorem 13.8. We ﬁrst remark that property g ∈D(T α) for some
α ∈R can be interpreted as a regularity condition for g with respect to
T . From this point of view, Theorem 13.8 shows that existence of ground
states of HT (g) depends on regularity of g with respect to T .
Suppose that T is absolutely continuous and E0(T ) = 0. Then, by the
Radon-Nikod´ym theorem, there exists a non-negative integrable function
fT,g such that, for all B ∈B1,
∥ET (B)g∥2 =
Z
B
fT,g(λ)dλ.
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model

Hence, if g ∈D(T −s) (s > 0), then
∥T −sg∥2 =
Z
[0,∞)
fT,g(λ)
λ2s
dλ < ∞.
It is easy to see that, for any ε > 0,
Z

dλ ≤1
ε2s ∥ET ([ε, ∞))g∥2 < ∞.
Hence g ∈D(T −1) if and only if
Z

fT,g(λ)
λ2
dλ < ∞
for some ε > 0. Therefore the behavior of the function fT,g(λ)/λ2 for small
λ ≈0 determines whether g ∈D(T −1) or not.
In quantum physics, a
neighborhood of the zero energy of a quantum particle is called an infrared
region, because it corresponds to a region of long wave lengths of the quan-
tum particle. With this picture in mind, we deﬁne a notion independently
of whether T is absolutely continuous or not.
A vector f ∈H is said to be infrared regular with respect to T if
f ∈D(T −1), and infrared singular with respect to T if f ̸∈D(T −1).
Theorem 13.8 is rephrased as follows:
Assume (13.13) and that T is absolutely continuous.
Then
HT (g) has no ground states if and only if g is infrared singular
with respect to T .
As already remarked, infrared singularity with respect to T occurs only
if (13.40) holds. Generally speaking, in a quantum ﬁeld theory with a quan-
tum particle whose Hamiltonian T satisﬁes (13.40), there may be structures
due to infrared singularity such as absence of ground states. Problems re-
lated to infrared singularity are generically called infrared problems.
Example 13.2. Consider the case where H = L2(Rd
k) and T be the mul-
tiplication operator by the function ω(k) =
√
k2 + m2, k ∈Rd (m ≥0).
Then E0(ω) = m. Hence the infrared singularity with respect to ω occurs
only if m = 0, i.e., the massless case. Therefore, in relativistic QFT with a
massless quantum ﬁeld, infrared problems can occur (see Theorem 13.9(iv)
below).
Example 13.3. Consider the case where T is the one-particle Hamiltonian
h0 of the free quantum de Broglie ﬁeld given by (9.9). Then E0(h0) = 0.
Hence, in a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with an interaction (e.g., the abstract
vHM model with H = L2(Rd) and T = h0), infrared problems can occur.

(i) H̺ is self-adjoint with D(H̺) = D(H0) and bounded from below.

π̺(t, f) := eitH̺π0(f)e−itH̺,
f ∈SR(S d), t ∈R,
the Heisenberg ﬁelds of φ0(f) and π0(f) with respect to H̺ respec-
tively. Then, for all Ψ ∈D((H̺−E0(H̺))3/2) (E0(H̺) := inf σ(H̺)),

and Ω0 be the Fock vacuum in Fb(L2(Rd

has a unique ground state given by
Ω̺ := e−iφ0(ib̺/ω)Ω0
(13.55)
up to constant multiples and E(̺) is the ground state energy of H̺:
H̺Ω̺ = E(̺)Ω̺. Moreover
σ(H̺) = {E(̺)} ∪[E(̺) + m, ∞),
σp(H̺) = {E(̺)}.
(iv) Consider the case where b̺ ̸∈H−3/2
ω
. Then m = 0 and H̺ has no
ground states. Moreover
σ(H̺) = [E(̺), ∞),
σp(H̺) = ∅.
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
739
Proof. We apply the results on the abstract vHM model to the following
case:
H = L2(Rd
k),
T = ω,
g = −b̺
√ω .
By (13.53), condition (13.13) with g = −b̺/√ω and T = ω is satisﬁed.
As a conjugation C satisfying (13.17) with T = ω, we take the Fourier
transform of the complex conjugation Cd on L2(Rd
x): C := FdCdF −1
d
(Cdu = u∗, u ∈L2(Rd
x)). We have
(Cf)(k) = f(−k)∗,
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
Hence Cω ⊂ωC. Therefore one can apply Theorem 13.1 to obtain (i).
If f ∈SR(Rd), then bf/√ω ∈D(T 2)∩D(T −1/2) with T = ω. Hence, by
Theorem 13.3, for all Ψ ∈D((H̺ −E0(H̺))3/2), φ̺(t, f)Ψ is twice strongly
diﬀerentiable in t and

Moreover,
ω2 bf = Fd(−∆+ m2)f.
Thus part (ii) follows.
The multiplication operator ω is absolutely continuous (see Example
C.2 in Appendix C) with
σ(ω) = σac(ω) = [m, ∞),
σp(ω) = ∅.
Hence we can apply Theorems 13.4 to obtain (iii).
Let b̺ ̸∈H−3/2
ω
(Rd). Then b̺/√ω ̸∈D(ω−1). Hence, as remarked at the
beginning of Section 13.7, E0(ω) = 0. Hence, by Example 13.2, m = 0.
The other statements in (iv) follow from Theorems 13.5 and 13.7.
Part (ii) in the above theorem shows that φ̺(t, f) is a quan-
tum ﬁeld satisfying an equation corresponding to the classical ﬁeld
equation (13.1) and π̺(t, f) is the canonical conjugate momentum to
φ̺(t, f). In view of Theorem 13.9(iii) and (iv), the concrete vHM model
(Fb(L2(Rd
k)), H̺, {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}) is said to be infrared regular
(resp. singular) if b̺/ω3/2 ∈L2(Rd
k) (resp. b̺/ω3/2 ̸∈L2(Rd
k)).

Infrared Catastrophe
We come back to the abstract vHM model again. We continue to assume
(13.13).
For each a > 0, we call Ha deﬁned by (13.42) the Hamiltonian of the
abstract vHM model with infrared cutoﬀa.
By (13.44), the vector
Ωa := U −1
a ΩH
is a unique ground state of Ha up to constant multiples. As we have seen in
the proof of Theorem 13.5, Ha converges to HT (g) in the strong resolvent
sense as a →0. But, if T is absolutely continuous and g is infrared singular
with respect to T , then HT (g) has no ground states (Theorem 13.8). Then
a natural question arises: how does Ωa behave as a →0 ? The next theorem
answers the question.
Theorem 13.10. Assume (13.13). Then the weak limit w- lima→0 Ωa = 0
if and only if g is infrared singular with respect to T .
Proof. Let f1, . . . , fn ∈H (n ∈N) and ga be as in (13.41). Then, by
(5.135) and Theorem 5.27,
⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , Ωa⟩= (−1)n

(13.56)
Suppose that w−lima→0 Ωa = 0. Then, considering (13.56) with n = 0,
we have lima→0 e−∥T −1ga∥2/4 = 0. Hence
lim
a→0 ∥T −1ga∥2 = ∞.
(13.57)
This implies that g ̸∈D(T )−1. Hence g is infrared singular with respect to
T .
Conversely, suppose that T ̸∈D(T −1). Then (13.57) holds. By (13.56)
we have
| ⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , Ωa⟩| ≤

2
n ∥T −1ga∥ne−∥T −1ga∥2/4

For any n ∈N, limt→∞tne−t2/4 = 0. Hence the above estimate implies
that
lim
a→0 ⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , Ωa⟩= 0
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ), lima→0 ⟨Ψ, Ωa⟩= 0. Since Fb,ﬁn(H ) is dense
and ∥Ωa∥= 1, we can apply Proposition A.1 in Appendix A to conclude
that w−lima→0 Ωa = 0.
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model

Theorem 13.10 means the following: the ground state Ωa of Ha has no
non-trivial weak limit within the boson Fock space Fb(H ) as a →0 if and
only if g is infrared singular with respect to T . This corresponds to the
absence of ground states of HT (g) with g infrared singular with respect to
T . Taking the limit a →0 physically corresponds to the removal of infrared
cutoﬀ. We remark that lima→0 T −1ga does not exist by (13.57), but
lim
a→0 T −sga = T −sg,
s ∈[0, 1/2].
(13.58)
Let us look at the behavior of other physically interesting quantities
as a →0. Let Nb be the boson number operator on Fb(H ). Then, by
(13.26), for all a > 0, Ωa ∈D(Nb) and
⟨Ωa, NbΩa⟩= 1
2∥T −1ga∥2.
From this, we obtain the following proposition:
Proposition 13.2. Assume (13.13). Then
lim
a→0 ⟨Ωa, NbΩa⟩= ∞.
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1).
This proposition shows that, if g is infrared singular with respect to T ,
then the expectation value of the number operator Nb in the ground state
Ωa with infrared cutoﬀa diverges in the limit of removing the infrared
cutoﬀ.
To see this result in more detail, for each E > 0, we introduce an
operator NE(T ) by
NE(T ) := dΓb(χ[0,E)(T )).
This operator physially measures the number of the bosons each of which
has an energy less than E.
Let a < E. Then, by an application of (13.25) (replace T and f by
χ[0,E)(T ) and −iT −1ga respectively), we have
⟨Ωa, NE(T )Ωa⟩= 1
2∥T −1χ[a,E)(T )g∥2.
It is easy to see that
lim
a→0 ∥T −1χ[a,E)(T )g∥2 = ∞
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1). Thus we obtain the following result:
Proposition 13.3. Assume (13.13) and E > 0. Then
lim
a→0 ⟨Ωa, NE(T )Ωa⟩= ∞
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1).

On the other hand, it is easy to see that, for all E > 0,
⟨Ωa, (Nb −NE(T ))Ωa⟩= 1
2∥T −1χ[E,∞)(T )ga∥2
a→0

Thus we see that the above divergence is caused by bosons with lower
enegies (longer wave lengths) . Such bosons are called soft bosons. In the
context of QFT, this kind of divergence is called an infrared divergence
or an infrared catastrophe.
13.10
A General Structure Behind the Infrared
Catastrophe
In this section, we show that the infrared catastrophe mentioned in the pre-
ceding section can be regarded as a special realization of a general structure
of the abstract vHM model. To describe it, we consider a family {g(κ)}κ>0
with g(κ) ∈D(T −1). By Theorem 13.4(iv), HT (g(κ)) has a unique ground
state whch is gven by ΩT (g(κ)) up to constant multiples. The next theorem
states a general structure of the abstract vHM model:
Theorem 13.11. The weak limit w- limκ→∞ΩT (g(κ)) = 0 if and only if
lim
κ→∞∥T −1g(κ)∥= ∞.
(13.59)
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 13.10 (we need only to replace ga
by g(κ)).
We emphasize that, in Theorem 13.11, the existence of limκ→∞g(κ) is
not assumed.
If g ∈H is infrared singular with respect to T , then g(κ) := χ[1/κ,∞)g
satisﬁes (13.59) as already seen.
There is another important case which is related to the behavior of the
model in higher energy regions.
Example 13.4. Suppose that T is unbounded and strictly positive, i.e.,
T ≥γ for some constant γ > 0. Then T −1 is bounded with D(T −1) = H .
Hence g is trivially infrared regular with respect to T . Moreover, we ﬁx a
vector v ∈H such that v ̸∈D(T p) for some p ∈N. Note that χ[0,κ](T )v ∈
C∞(T ) for all κ > 0. Hence one can deﬁne
g(κ) := T p+1χ[0,κ](T )v,
κ > 0.
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
743
Since v ̸∈D(T p), it follows that
∥T −1g(κ)∥2 =
Z
[0,κ]
λ2pd∥ET (λ)v∥2 →∞(κ →∞).
(13.60)
Hence, by Theorem 13.11,
w- lim
κ→∞ΩT (g(κ)) = 0.
(13.61)
We note that, in this example, there are no subsequences {κn}n tending
to ∞as n →∞such that w- limn→∞g(κn) exists in H . To see this, suppose
that w- limn→∞g(κn) = g ∈H . Then, by the boundedness of T −(p+1),
w- limn→∞T −(p+1)g(κn) = T −(p+1)g. On the other hand, it follows from
the deﬁnition of g(κ) that T −(p+1)g(κn) →v (n →∞). Hence v = T −(p+1)g.
Therefore v ∈D(T p+1) ⊂D(T p). But this is a contradiction.
The fact just shown implies that,
for all Ψ
∈
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )),
{ΦS(g(κ))Ψ}κ has no subsequences which weakly converge.
Hence
HT (g(κ))Ψ has no weak limit as κ →∞. Thus, in this example, in contrast
to the case of the infrared catastrophe (see (13.58)), it is suggested that
a Hamiltonian which may correspond to κ = ∞cannot be deﬁned as an
operator on the boson Fock space Fb(H ).
As is seen from (13.60), the divergences related to g(κ) as κ →∞
come from higher energy regions, in other words, regions of shorter wave
lengths—ultraviolet regions. Hence this kind of divergences is called ul-
traviolet divergence or ultraviolet catastrophe. The parameter κ is
called an ultraviolet cutoﬀ.
Property (13.61) for the present type of
g(κ) is called the ultraviolet van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon in the
abstract sense.
By abuse of words, we call property w- lima→∞Ωa = 0 the infrared
van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon in the abstract sense.
Example 13.5. In the concrete vHM model with ̺ = ̺(p), b̺(p)/√ω is not
in L2(Rd). In this case, one can deﬁne a source ̺κ with an ultraviolet cutoﬀ
κ > 0 in such a way that
b̺κ(k) := χ[0,κ](|k|)b̺(p)(k) =
1
(2π)d/2
N
X
n=1
λnχ[0,κ](|k|)e−ik·xn,
k ∈Rd.
Consider the case m > 0. Then b̺κ/√ω ∈D(ω−1). Hence, by Theorem
13.9, H̺κ has a unique ground state Ω̺κ. But, if d ≥3, then
lim
κ→∞∥ω−1b̺κ/√ω∥= ∞.

Van Hove–Miyatake Phenomena and Inequivalent
Representations of CCR
In this section we investigate van Hove–Miyatake phenomena from view
points of the representation theory of CCR with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
We freely use mathematical terms in Chapter 5.
13.11.1
The infrared case
We assume (13.13) and that T −1 is unbounded. Let C(f) (f ∈D(T −1/2))
be as in (13.49). Then C(f) is a Bogoliubov translation (see Subsection
5.25.2) with the translation functional
LT,g(f) :=
1
√
2
D
T −1/2g, T −1/2f
E
.
It follows that
πT,g := (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {C(f)|f ∈V })
is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V (see also Example 5.9).
Proposition 13.4.
(i) The representation πT,g is equivalent to the Fock representation πF(V )
(see Example 5.8) if and only if g ∈D(T −1). In that case,
C(f) = eiΦS(iT −1g)A(f)e−iΦS(iT −1g),
f ∈V ,
(13.62)
(ii) There exists a second quantization operator of T associated with πT,g
and it is given by HT (g) −E(T, g) on Fb,ﬁn(V ).
Proof. (i) It is easy to see that there exists a vector h ∈H such that
LT,g(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V if and only if g ∈D(T −1), and, in that case,
h = T −1g/
√
2. Hence, by Theorem 5.46, πT,g is equivalent to πF(V ) if and
only if g ∈D(T −1).
Formula (13.62) follows from Theorem 5.28.
(ii) This follows from Example 5.15.
Proposition 13.4(i) gives a characterization of absence of ground states
of HT (g) and the infrared van Hove-Miyatake phenomenon from a repre-
sentation theoretical point of view on CCR:
(i) Suppose that T is absolutely continuous. Then the absence of ground
states of HT (g) exactly corresponds to the case where πT,g is inequiv-
alent to πF(V ) (see Theorem 13.8).
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
745
(ii) The infrared van Hove-Miyatake phenomenon exactly corresponds to
the case where πT,g is inequivalent to πF(V ).
Absence of ground states and the infrared van Hove-Miyatake phe-
nomenon may be singular from a conventional point of view, but, from
another point of view, they may be regarded as characteristic phenomena.
It is very interesting to know that the representation πT,g describes phys-
ically inequivalent phases depending on whether it is equivalent to πF(V )
or not.
13.11.2
The ultraviolet case
In this subsection we assume that the self-adjoint operator T is strictly
positive and unbounded. Then, for all s > 0, T −s is bounded with D(T −s) =
H . Hence one can deﬁne an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩−s : H × H →C of H by
⟨f, g⟩−s :=

T −sf, T −sg

H
(f, g ∈H ).
The inner product space (H , ⟨·, ·⟩−s) is not complete (Problem 5). We
denote its completion by H−s(T ).
We set H0(T ) := H and, for s > 0, Hs(T ) := D(T s) is a Hilbert space
with inner product ⟨f, g⟩s := ⟨T sf, T sg⟩H (f, g ∈D(T s)). Thus we have a
family {Hs(T )}s∈R of Hilbert spaces satisfying
Hs(T ) ⊂Hs′(T ),
s′ < s, s, s′ ∈R.
It is called the Hilbert scale of H with respect to T .
For all s > 0 and f ∈D(T s), g ∈H , we have by the Schwarz inequality
| ⟨g, f⟩H | = |

T −sg, T sf

H | ≤∥g∥−s∥f∥s.
Hence the inner product ⟨·, ·⟩H is uniquely extended to the sesquilinear
form −s ⟨·, ·⟩s: H−s(T ) × Hs(T ) →C such that
|−s ⟨g, f⟩s | ≤∥g∥−s∥f∥s,
g ∈H−s(T ), f ∈Hs(T )
and
−s ⟨g, f⟩s = ⟨g, f⟩H ,
f ∈D(T s), g ∈H .
It is obvious that, for each g ∈H−s(T ), the functional φg : Hs(T ) →C
deﬁned by
φg(f) := −s ⟨g, f⟩s ,
f ∈Hs(T )
is a continuous linear functinal, i.e., φg ∈Hs(T )∗(the dual space of Hs(T )).
It is shown that ∥φg∥= ∥g∥−s. Conversely, by using the Riesz representa-
tion theorem, one can show that, for each φ ∈Hs(T )∗, there exists a unique
 

746
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
g ∈H−s(T ) such that φ = φg. The mapping:H−s(T ) ∋g 7→φg ∈Hs(T )∗
is bijective and anti-linear. In this sense we identify Hs(T )∗with H−s(T )
and write g(f) for φg(f):
g(f) := −s ⟨g, f⟩s ,
g ∈H−s(T ), f ∈Hs(T ).
(13.63)
Let n ∈Z+. Then, for any φ ∈H−(n+1)(T ), there exists a sequence
{φj}j in H such that ∥φj −φ∥−(n+1) →0 (j →∞). Hence {T −(n+1)φj}j
is a Cauchy sequence in H .
Hence {T −1φj}j is a Cauchy sequence in
H−n(T ). Therefore there exists a unique vector fφ ∈H−n(T ) such that
∥T −1φj −fφ∥−n →0 (j →∞). Thus the correspondence: φ →fφ deﬁnes a
mapping from H−(n+1)(T ) to H−n(T ). We denote this mapping by bT −1:
bT −1φ := fφ.
Note that, if φ ∈H , then bT −1φ = T −1φ.
Since ∥fφ∥−n = ∥φ∥−(n+1), we have
∥bT −1φ∥−n = ∥φ∥−(n+1).
Hence bT −1 is an isometry from H−(n+1) to H−n. Moreover, bT −1 is surjec-
tive. Thus bT −1 is a unitary operator from H−(n+1) to H−n.
Now suppose that, for some natural number p ≥1, g ∈H−(p+1)(T ).
Let
w := bT −1g ∈H−p(T ).
Then there exists a sequence {wj}j in H such that ∥wj −w∥−p →0 (j →
∞). Hence {T −pwj}j is a Cauchy sequence in H . Therefore the limit
ug := lim
j→∞T −pwj ∈H
exists. It is easy to see that this limit is independent of the choice of {wj}j.
Therefore one can deﬁne a linear functional ℓg on D(T p) by
ℓg(f) :=
1
√
2 ⟨ug, T pf⟩H = lim
j→∞
1
√
2 ⟨wj, f⟩H , f ∈D(T p).
Note that, if g ∈H , then
ℓg(f) =

T −1g, f

,
f ∈H .
We consider the Bogoliubov translation with the translation functional
equal to ℓg:
Bg(f) := A(f) + ℓg(f)∗,
f ∈D(T p).
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
747
Let W be a dense subspace of H such that W ⊂D(T p). Then we have an
irreducible representation
bπT,g := {Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(W ), {Bg(f)|f ∈W }}
of the CCR over W .
Proposition 13.5. The representation bπT,g is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation πF(W ) if and only if bT −1g ∈H .
Proof. Suppose that bπT,g is equivalent to πF(W ).
Then, by Theorem
5.46, there exists a vector h ∈H such that ℓg(f) = ⟨h, f⟩H , f ∈W .
Hence ug ∈D(T p) and T pug =
√
2h. Therefore ug =
√
2T −ph so that
∥wj −
√
2h∥−p →0 (j →∞). Hence w =
√
2h. Thus bT −1g ∈H .
Conversely suppose that w = bT −1g ∈H . Then ∥T −pwj −T −pw∥→
0 (j →∞).
Hence, for any f ∈D(T p), ⟨wj, f⟩= ⟨T −pwj, T pf⟩
j→∞
−→
⟨T −pw, T pf⟩= ⟨w, f⟩. Therefore ℓg(f) =

w/
√
2, f

. Hence, by Theorem
5.46, bπT,g is equivalent to πF(W ).
The contraposition of Proposition 13.5 immediately gives the next
proposition:
Proposition 13.6. The representation bπT,g is inequivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation πF(W ) if and only if bT −1g ̸∈H .
Example 13.6. Let g(κ) ∈H (κ > 0) and (13.59) be satisﬁed. Then
T −1g(κ) does not converge in H as κ →∞and hence g(κ) does not neither.
Assume that there exists an element g ∈H−(p+1)(T ) with some p ∈N such
that limκ→∞∥g(κ) −g∥−(p+1) = 0 and there exists no vector h ∈H such
that, for all f ∈D(T p), limκ→∞

T −1g(κ), f

= ⟨h, f⟩.
Then, bπT,g is
an inequivalent representation to the Fock representation πF(W ). This is
proved as follows.
By Theorem 5.46, the representation bπT,g(κ) is equivalent to the Fock
representation πF(W ). It follows from the discussion leading to the deﬁni-
tion of ℓg(f) that, for all f ∈D(T p),
lim
κ→∞ℓg(κ)(f) = ℓg(f)
with ug := limκ→∞T −p−1g(κ). Hence
lim
κ→∞Bg(κ)(f)Ψ = Bg(f)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fﬁn,b(H ), f ∈D(T p).
We next show that bT −1g ̸∈H .
Suppose that bT −1g ∈H .
Then
g ∈H−1(T ). Hence, for all f ∈D(T p),
D
T −1g(κ), f
E
=
D
T −(p+1)g(κ), T pf
E κ→∞
→
D
T −p bT −1g, T pf
E
=
D
bT −1g, f
E
.
 

748
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
But this contradicts the present assumption. Hence bT −1g ̸∈H . Therefore,
by Proposition 13.6, bπT,g is inequivalent to the Fock representation πF(W ).
Thus we see that the ultraviolet van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon with
additional conditions implies the inequivalence of bπT,g to the Fock repre-
sentation πF(W ).
Example 13.7. Let us consider the concrete vHM model with point source
̺(p) with d ≥3. Let ̺κ be as in Example 13.5. Let g(κ) := b̺κ/√ω and
g := b̺(p)/√ω. Then, for all p > (d−3)/2, it holds that g(κ), g ∈D(ω−(p+1))
and
lim
κ→∞∥ω−(p+1)(g(κ) −g)∥= 0.
We have for all f ∈D(ωp)

But g/ω ̸∈L2(Rd). Hence there exists no vector h ∈L2(Rd
k) such that,
for all f ∈D(ωp), limκ→∞

ω−1g(κ), f

= ⟨h, f⟩. Thus g(κ) and g under
consideration satisfy the conditions of (g(κ), g) in Example 13.6.

Heisenberg Field and VEV’s
13.12.1
An explicit form of Heisenberg ﬁeld of the abstract
vHM model
Using Theorem 13.6, one can derive an explicit form of the Heisenberg ﬁeld
Φ(t, f) and the conjugate ﬁeld Π(t, f) (see (13.18) and (13.19)).
Let C(f) (f ∈D(T −1/2)) be deﬁned by (13.49) and
ΦT,g(f) :=
1
√
2 {C(f)∗+ C(f)} ,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
Explicitly we have
ΦT,g(f) = ΦS(f) + RT,g(f),
where
RT,g(f) := Re
D
T −1/2f, T −1/2g
E
.
Hence
φF(f) = ΦT,g(f) −RT,g(f),
(13.64)
πF(f) = ΦT,g(if) −RT,g(if),
f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩HC,

on D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗). By Theorem 13.6, we have
eitHT (g)ΦT,g(f)e−itHT (g) = ΦT,g(eitT f).
Thus we obtain the following result:
Theorem 13.12. For all t ∈R, f ∈D(T −1) ∩HC, f ′ ∈D(T 1/2) ∩HC
and Ψ ∈Fb,0(H )
Φ(t, f)Ψ =

Ψ.
13.12.2
VEV’s
The free Heisenberg ﬁeld Φfree(t, f) (f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩HC) is deﬁned by
Φfree(t, f) := eitdΓb(T )φF(T −1/2f)e−itdΓb(T ),
t ∈R.
By (5.126), we have
Φfree(t, f) = φF(eitT T −1/2f) = ΦS(eitT T −1/2f)
(13.66)
on Fb,0(H ). Hence, by (13.64) and (13.65), we have
Φ(t, f) = Φfree(t, f) + RT,g((eitT −1)T −1/2f)
on Fb,0(H ).
For (tj, fj) ∈R × (D(T −1/2) ∩HC) (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N), the VEV’s of
the free Heisengberg ﬁelds with respect to the Fock vacuum ΩH are deﬁned
by
W free

E
.
As we already know, the right hand side can be explicitly represented (The-
orem 5.32). Here we do not write down the explicit representation of W free
n
.
Assume (13.31). Then, by Theorem 13.4(iv), HT (g) has a unique ground
state ΩT (g). This can be regarded as a variant of the Fock vacuum ΩH
under the interaction ΦS(g) (note that ΩT (0) = ΩH ). We call the ground
state ΩT (g) the physical vacuum of the abstract vHM model to
distinguish it from the Fock vacuum.
 

750

By (13.65), the physical vacuum ΩT (g) is in the domain of the products
of any number of the Heisenberg ﬁelds. Hence, for all n ∈N and (tj, fj) ∈
R × (D(T −1) ∩HC) (j = 1, . . . , n), we can deﬁne the physical VEV’s

Using these results, one can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 13.13. Assume that (i) g ̸∈D(T −1) and T is absolutely contin-
uous or (ii) g ∈D(T −1). Then the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to
any free Bose ﬁeld theory.
Proof. In case (i), by Theorem 13.7, HT (g) has no ground state. Hence
the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to any free Bose ﬁeld theory, since
the latter has a ground state.
In case (ii), HT (g) has a ground state ΩT (g) as already seen. By (13.68)
and g ̸= 0, W (g)
1
̸= 0 as a function on R × D(T −1). On the other hand,
in any free Bose ﬁeld theory, the 1-point VEV is zero. Hence, by Corol-
lary 13.1, the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to any free Bose ﬁeld
theory.
13.13
Removal of Cutoﬀs
Suppose that there exists a natural number n0 ∈N and a net {g(κ)}κ>0
with g(κ) ∈D(T −1) such that, for all f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T n0),
ℓT,∞(f) := lim
κ→∞
D
T −1/2g(κ), T −1/2f
E
(13.69)
exists. This setting includes removal of both infrared and ultraviolet cutoﬀs
as the following examples show.
Example 13.8. Consider the case where g ∈D(T −1/2). For each κ > 0,
the vector g(κ) := χ[1/κ,∞)(T )g is in D(T −1). It is easy to see that
ℓT,∞(f) =
D
T −1/2g, T −1/2f
E
,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
If g ̸∈D(T −1), then the limit κ →∞corresponds to the removal of infrared
cutoﬀ1/κ.
Example 13.9. Let T be a strictly positive unbounded self-adjoint oper-
ator on H and {Hs(T )}s∈R be the Hilbert scale of H with respect to T .
Suppose that, for some n0 ∈N, g ∈H−n0−1(T ). Let g(κ) ∈H be such
that limκ→∞∥g(κ) −g∥−(n0+1) = 0. Then
φg := lim
κ→∞T −(n0+1)g(κ)

exists in H . Hence we have for all f ∈D(T n0)

D
T −1/2g(κ), T −1/2f
E

Therefore ℓT,∞(f) exists and
ℓT,∞(f) = ⟨φg, T n0f⟩H = g(T −1f)
f ∈D(T n0).
If g ̸∈H , then the limit κ →∞in the present case corresponds to the
removal of ultraviolet cutoﬀκ.
Theorem 13.14. Let n ∈N, tj ∈R and fj ∈D(T −1) ∩D(T n0), j =
1, . . . , n. Then
W ∞
n (t1, f1, . . . , tn, fn) := lim

lim
κ→∞RT,g(κ)(T −1/2f) = Re ℓT,∞(T −1/2f),
f ∈D(T −1).
Hence taking the limit κ →∞in (13.67) with g = g(κ) yields (13.70).
13.14
Construction of the vHM Model Without Cutoﬀs
As already seen, the abstract vHM model with g ̸∈D(T −1) (g ∈D(T −1/2))
has no ground states if T is absolutely continuous and the abstract vHM
model without ultraviolet cutoﬀs may not be deﬁned in Fb(H ) as a limit
of the abstract vHM model with ultraviolet cutoﬀs as suggested in Example
13.4. But Theorem 13.14 suggests the existence of the vHM model without
cutoﬀs whose physical VEV’s are equal to {W ∞
n }∞
n=0. In fact, the existence
itself follows from an application of Wightman’s reconstruction theorem.3
3Originally Wightman’s reconstruction theorem is established in the context of a rela-
tivistic QFT. But, as far as the construction of a Hilbert space, a quantum ﬁeld and a
Hamitonian with a ground state is concerned, it is not restricted to relativistic QFT’s.
The construction is essentially an application of the idea of the so-called GNS (Gel’fand-
Naimark-Segal) construction (see, e.g., [Araki (1993), §2.3]).
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
753
But here we give an explicit construction of the vHM model without cutoﬀs.
The idea for that is to employ (13.49) and Theorem 13.6 to deﬁne a new
representation of CCR for the time-zero ﬁelds diﬀerent from the Fock rep-
resentation of CCR. This is done by replacing (HT (g), C(f)) (see (13.49))
by (dΓb(T ), A(f)) and introducing a new operator corresponding to the
operator A(f) in (13.49), i.e.,
B∞(f) := A(f) −1
√
2ℓT,∞(f)∗,
f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T n0),
where ℓT,∞(f) is deﬁned by (13.69).
Note that the sign in front of
ℓT,∞(f)∗/
√
2 in the above deﬁnition is minus.
We ﬁx a dense subspace V ⊂D(T −1) ∩D(T n0). Then
π∞:= (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {B∞(f)|f ∈V })
is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V . By Theorem 5.46, we
have the following fact:
Lemma 13.8. The representation π∞is equivalent to the Fock represen-
tation πF(V ) if and only if there exists a vector h ∈H such that, for all
f ∈V , ℓT,∞(f) = ⟨h, f⟩H .
Example 13.10. For ℓT,∞in Example 13.8, π∞is inequivalent to πF(V )
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1).
Example 13.11. For ℓT,∞in Example 13.9, π∞is inequivalent to πF(V )
if and only if φg ̸∈D(T n0).
For f ∈D(T −1) ∩D(T n0) ∩HC and f ′ ∈D(T n0) ∩HC,
φ∞(f) :=
1
√


B∞(T −1/2f)∗+ B∞(T −1/2f)

,
π∞(f ′) :=
i
√
2

B∞(T 1/2f ′)∗−B∞(T 1/2f ′)

.
It follows that (Fb(H ), {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC} (VC := V ∩HC) is an
irreducible representation of the Heisenberg CCR over VC. Explicitly we
have
φ∞(f) = φF(T −1/2f) −Re ℓT,∞(T −1/2f),
π∞(f ′) = πF(T 1/2f) + Im ℓT,∞(T 1/2f).
We construct a QFT whose time-zero ﬁeld and conjugate ﬁeld are equal
to φ∞(·) and π∞(·) respectively. As the Hamiltonian of the model to be
constructed, we take
H := dΓb(T ).
 

754
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then H has a unique vacuum
Ω:= ΩH .
Thus the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) has a unique ground state.
It is easy to see tnat the Heisenberg operators
φ∞(t, f) := eitHφ∞(f)e−itH,
π∞(t, f) := eitHπ∞(f)e−itH
(t ∈R, f ∈D(T −1) ∩D(T n0) ∩HC) take the form
φ∞(t, f) = ΦS(eitT T −1/2f) −Re ℓT,∞(T −1/2f),
(13.71)
π∞(t, f) = ΦS(ieitT T 1/2f) + Im ℓT,∞(T 1/2f),
(13.72)
on D(N 1/2
b
).
In quite the same way as in the computations in Subsection 13.12.2,
we can prove the following formula: For all n ∈N, tj ∈R, fj ∈D(T −1) ∩
D(T n0) ∩HC, j = 1, . . . , n,
W ∞
n (t1, f1, t2, f2, . . . , tn, fn) = ⟨Ω, φ∞(t1, f1) · · · φ∞(tn, fn)Ω⟩.
Thus the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) can be regaded as an ab-
stract vHM model describing the limit κ →∞of the cutoﬀmodel
(HT (g(κ)), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}).
We remark that, although the Hamiltonian H of the model con-
structed above is given by the second quantization dΓb(T ) of T , the model
(H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) is not equivalent to the free Bose ﬁeld model
(dΓb(T ), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}) provided that Re ℓT,∞̸= 0. In
the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}), the eﬀect of the interaction is in
the time-zero ﬁelds (φ∞(·), π∞(·)), not in H. As emphasized in Section
13.4, a unitary equivalence of Hamiltonians is not suﬃcient for the quan-
tum ﬁeld models with them to be equivalent.
Let us derive equations of φ∞(t, f).
Let f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T 2) ∩
D(T n0) ∩HC. Then, by (13.71), (13.72) and Theorem 5.31, for all Ψ ∈
D(N 1/2
b
), φ∞(t, f)Ψ is twice strongly diﬀerentiable with

and

Hence

(13.73)

on D(N 1/2
b
). Note that (13.14) and (13.73) are extensions of Theorem 13.3.
Example 13.12. Consider the situation in Example 13.8 with g ̸∈D(T −1).
Then the model (HT (g), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}) has no ground
state, but the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) does. By Example 13.8,
we have ℓT,∞(f) =

T −1/2g, T −1/2f

. Hence the ﬁeld equation takes the
following form: for all f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T 2) ∩HC

on D(N 1/2

), which is the same as (13.24).
Example 13.13. Consider the situation in Example 13.9 with g ̸∈H
and g ∈H−n0−1(T ) for some n0 ≥1.
In this case, the vHM model
cannot be deﬁned in such a way that the Hamiltonian is of the form
HT (g).
But the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) can be regarded
as a model for such a case, describing the limit κ →∞of the model
(HT (g(κ)), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}). In the present case, the ﬁeld
equation is given by
d2
dt2 φ∞(t, f) + φ∞(t, T 2f) = −Re g(T 1/2f)
on D(N 1/2
b
).
The concrete vHM model with point source ̺(p) is a special case of
the present example with T = ω (m > 0) and g = b̺(p)/√ω. Thus we have
constructed the concrete vHM model with point source, which has a unique
ground state.
From the analyses made so far, we see that representations of time-zero
ﬁelds as those of CCR play important roles:
(1) Even in the case where a quantum ﬁeld model has no ground state
in a representation of time-zero ﬁelds, it may have a ground state in
another representation of time-zero ﬁelds which is inequivalent to the
former one.
(2) In the case where the Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld model with
ultraviolet cutoﬀκ > 0 does not converge in a “natural” sense to an op-
erator within the Hilbert space under consideration in the limit κ →∞
of removing the ultraviolet cutoﬀ, but the VEV’s converge as κ →∞,
the model without ultraviolet cutoﬀmay be constructed in a represen-
tation of time-zero ﬁelds inequivalent to the Fock representation.
 

756
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is interesting that, in both cases, representations of CCR inequivalent to
the Fock representation play essential roles.
13.15
Point Source Limit of the Ground State Energy of
the Concrete vHM Model

of the model (see Theorem 13.9).
Here we assume that d ≥3 in the
massless case m = 0. Then b̺κ/ω ∈L2(Rd) in the case m = 0 too. By
direct computations, we have
Eκ = Sκ + Vκ(x1, . . . , xN)

It is obvious that, if d ≥2 in the case m > 0 and d ≥3 in the case m = 0,
Sκ →−∞(κ →∞).
Concerning the limit κ →∞of Vκ, we consider only the case d = 3
for simplicity (for other cases, see Remark 13.10 below). So let d = 3. By
change of variables to the polar coordinate in R3, we have for x ̸= 0

where Kν is the modiﬁed Bessel function of order ν.
The above results may be interpreted as follows. Suppose that the point
sources at x1, . . . , xN are ﬁxed nucleons. Then, as mentioned before, the
concrete vHM model describes a model of bosons (neutral pions) interacting
with the ﬁxed nucleons. The interaction generates nuclear forces as a result
of exchanges of pions by nucleons.
The ground state energy Eκ up to
constant additions may be interpretd as expressing the potential energy of
the nuclear forces in the ground state. It follows from (13.74) that
lim
κ→∞(Eκ −Sκ) =
X
j<n
λjλnVm(xj −xn).
Hence P
j<n λjλnVm(xj −xn) is interpreted as the potential energy of the
nuclear forces in the ground state. The quantity Sκ diverging to −∞as
κ →∞is interpreted as a self-energy of the ﬁxed nucleons. The prescription
subtracting Sκ from Eκ to obtain a ﬁnite quantity in the limit κ →∞is an
example of the so-called energy renormalization. In this way, a quantum
ﬁeld theoretical derivation of the Yukawa type potential or the Coulomb
type potential is done.
13.16
Scattering Theory
In concluding this chapter, we consider the scattering theory in the ab-
stract vHM model (see Section 8.12 for a general theory of scattering). For
notational simplicity, we use the following symbols:
H(g) := HT (g),
Hb := dΓb(T ).
 

758
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We set
bH(g) := H(g) −E(T, g) ≥0.
As we have seen, H(g) has no ground state if g ̸∈D(T −1) and T is abso-
lutely continuous. Hence, in this case, the scattering theory presented in
Section 8.12 cannot be applied.4 Taking this fact into account, in what fol-
lows, we assume (13.31). Under this condition, H(g) has a unique ground
state ΩT (g) (see Theorem 13.4).
Following the scheme of the scattering theory in Section 8.12, we deﬁne
for (f, t) ∈D(T −1/2) × R
At(f) := eitH(g)e−itHbA(f)eitHbe−itH(g)
= eitH(g)A(e−itT f)e−itH(g)
Theorem 13.15. Assume (13.31) and that T is absolutely continuous.
Then, for all f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( bH(g)1/2),
A±,0(f)Ψ :=
lim
t→±∞At(f)Ψ = C(f)Ψ,
(13.76)
A†
±,0(f)Ψ :=
lim
t→±∞At(f)∗Ψ = C(f)∗Ψ,
(13.77)
where C(f) is deﬁned by (13.49).
Proof. Let U := eiΦS(iT −1g). Then, by Theorem 13.4,
bH(g) = UHbU −1.
Hence, by the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we have
eit b
H(g) = UeitHbU −1
for all t ∈R. Therefore
At(f) = UeitHbU −1A(e−itT f)Ue−itHbU −1

where we have used Theorem 5.28. Using the formula

4In this case, one can develop a diﬀerent type of scattering theory for the model
(H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) constructed in Section 13.14, employing the idea of the so-
called LSZ (Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann) formalism (see, e.g., [Bogoliubov et al.
(1975), Chapter 4, §2]).
 

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
759
and Theorem 5.28 again, we obtain
At(f) = C(f) −1

e−itT f, g

.
Since T is absolutely continuous, it follows from Theorem C.2 in Appendix
C that limt→±∞

= 0. Hence (13.76) follows. Similarly (13.77)
is obtained.
Formula (13.76) clariﬁes a meaning of C(f), i.e., C(f) is the asymptotic
annhilation operator with test vector f.
Formula (13.76) shows that, for all f ∈D(T −1/2),
A±(f) := A±,0(f) = C(f).
and
A±(f)∗= C(f)∗.
Note that
UA(f)U −1 = A±(f).
Hence, for all n ≥0 and fj ∈D(T −1/2) (j = 1, . . . , n),
UA(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH = A±(f1)∗· · · A±(fn)∗ΩT (g).
Therefore
Fin = Fout = Fb(H )
in the present case. But we have
A+(f)∗= A−(f)∗,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
Hence the scattering operator S is the identity I on Fb(H ). Thus, in the
vHM model, there is no scattering.
Remark 13.11. One can also use the method in Subsection 8.12.7 to prove
(13.76) and (13.77). But, in this method, one needs an additional condition

Chapter 14
Models in QFT
Some interacting quantum ﬁeld models are described.
14.1
Introduction
The vHM model discussed in the preceding chapter is a simple model in
QFT. Of course, there are other interacting quantum ﬁeld models which
are more complicated and/or more physically realistic. In this chapter, for
further studies, we present a list of interacting quantum ﬁeld models which
have been investigated so far in the ﬁeld of mathematical QFT, although it
is not a complete one. Interacting quantum ﬁeld models are classiﬁed into
four categories mainly:
(i) Purely bosonic ﬁeld models.
(ii) Purely fermionic ﬁeld models.
(iii) Boson-fermion interaction models.
(iv) Models of particle-ﬁeld interactions.
Here models which are neither completely relativistic nor completely
Galilean symmetric, also, are included.
Such models may play roles as
“approximate” versions of “true” models which are expected to exist or
phenomenological models, e.g., in condensed matter physics. We explain
these categories one by one below. But, before doing that, we remark on a
common strategy for constructing quantum ﬁeld models.
To be deﬁnite, let us consider the case of constructing a relativistic inter-
acting neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld model in the (1+d)-dimensional space-
time. In this case, a formal Hamiltonian of the model heuristically given in
correspondence to the classical ﬁeld theory is ill-deﬁned, since a point-wise
quantum ﬁeld does not exist as a Hilbert space operator by Wightman’s
765
 

766
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
theorem (see Remark 8.3(1); see also Example 10.2 and Remark 10.6). To
avoid this diﬃculty, one usually proceeds as follows:
Step 1. One introduces a momentum cutoﬀκ > 0 and a space cutoﬀL >
0 in the formal Hamiltonian to obtain a well-deﬁned operator H(L, κ) acting
in the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) and considers it as an approximate
Hamiltonian of the “true” Hamiltonian to be constructed, where L is a size
such that, only in the cubic box {x ∈Rd| |xj| ≤L/2, j = 1, . . . , d} or in a
neighborhood of it, the interaction of the quantum ﬁeld under consideration
occurs. Usually the time-zero ﬁelds are taken to be the Fock representation
{φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}. In this way one ﬁrst deﬁnes a cutoﬀmodel.
Step 2. One shows that H(L, κ) is essentially self-adjoint and bounded
from below. For notational simplicity, here we denote the closure of H(L, κ)
by the same symbol.
Step 3.
Suppose that H(L, κ) contains parameters λ(j) ∈R, j =
1, . . . , J (masses, charges, coupling constants, . . .) and write H(L, κ) =
H(s) with s := (L, κ, λ(1), . . . , λ(J)).
Let Hn := H(sn) −En with
sn := (Ln, κn, λ(1)
n , . . . , λ(J)
n ) and En ∈R (n ∈N).
Then one investi-
gates if there exist a sequence {(sn, En)}n and a self-adjoint operator H on
Fb(L2(Rd
k)) such that s- limn→∞e−itHn = e−itH, t ∈R.
At this step, one needs detailed operator-theoretical analyses of H(L, κ).
But, in most cases (in particular, in models of relativistic QFT), it is not
expected that such a self-adjoint operator H exists. This is closely related
to the fact that, in non-trivial interacting quantum ﬁeld models without
cutoﬀs, inﬁnite renormalizations are necessary on the level of perturbation
theories.
The sequence {(sn, En)}n is for a renormalization of H(L, κ)
which includes divergences (e.g., usually En →−∞as n →∞).
Step 4. If a self-adjoint operator H in Step 3 exists, then one deﬁnes
a model without cutoﬀs whose Hamiltonian is given by H and investigates
properties of this model (e.g., spectral properties of H).
In the case where a self-adjoint operator H in Step 3 does not exist or
H is not expected to exist, one proceeds as follows:
Step 3′. One proves that H(L, κ) has a (unique) ground state ΩL,κ.
Step 4′. Let ϕ0(f) := φ0(f1) + iφ0(f2), f = f1 + if2 ∈S (Rd), f1, f2 ∈
SR(Rd).
Then one shows that, for all u ∈S (R) and f ∈S (Rd), the
Bochner integral ϕ(n)(u × f) :=
R
R u(t)eitHnϕ0(f)e−itHndt exists on a suit-
able subspace and that the Wightman distributions with cutoﬀs

E

can be deﬁned (N ∈N, uj ∈S (R), fj ∈S (Rd), j = 1, . . . , N).
Step 5′. One shows that, for some {(sn, En)}n,
WN(u1 × f1, . . . , uN × fN) := lim
n→∞W (n)
N (u1 × f1, . . . , uN × fN)
exists and that it can be extended to a tempered distribution f
WN on
(R1+d)N.
Step 6′. One shows that {f
WN}∞
N=0 (W0 := 1) satisﬁes the Wightman
axioms.
Similar strategies apply to other types of quantum ﬁeld models. Con-
cerning relativistic models, one can take also a strategy, called the Euclidean
strategy (see Section 8.10), whose goal is to construct Schwinger functions
of each model and to show that they satisfy the Osterwalder–Schrader ax-
ioms. For this approach, functional integration methods are very useful
(see, e.g., [Arai et al. (2016)], [Derezi´nski and G´erard (2013), Chapter 21],
[Ezawa and Arai (1988); Fern´andez et al. (1992); Glimm and Jaﬀe (1987);
L¨orinczi et al. (2011); Simon (1974, 1979)]. A pedagogical and compre-
hensive review on mathematical methods to study quantum ﬁeld models is
found in [Arai (2002)].
With the above remarks, in what follows, we deﬁne only models with
cutoﬀs which make starting points for construction of models without cut-
oﬀs or models with more symmetries.
14.2
Purely Bosonic Field Models
A purely bosonic ﬁeld model is a model which describes only a self-
interaction of a Bose ﬁeld and/or an interaction among Bose ﬁelds of dif-
ferent kinds. In this category, there are two classes, i.e., relativistic ones
and non-relativistic ones.
14.2.1
P (φ)1+d model
In the classical ﬁeld theory, one can consider a real scalar ﬁeld φcl : M1+d →
R on the (1+d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time M1+d satisfying a non-
linear KG equation—a non-linear perturbation of the free KG equation—
(□+ m2)φcl(x) = −4λφcl(x)3 −2σφcl(x) + µ,
x = (t, x) ∈M1+d, (14.1)
where m > 0, λ > 0, σ ∈R and µ ≥0 are parameters. The right hand side
gives a form of non-linear self-interactions of the ﬁeld φcl. A model of this
type is called a classical φ4
1+d model.
 

768
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A generalization of this model is given by a real scalar ﬁeld φcl satisfying
a more general non-linear KG equation
(□+ m2)φcl(x) = −P ′(φcl(x)),
x ∈M1+d,
(14.2)
where P : R →R is a real polynomial of the form
P(φ) =
2p
X
r=0
arφr,
φ ∈R
(14.3)
with coeﬃcients a2p > 0, ar ∈R, r = 0, 1, . . . , 2p −1 (p ∈N, p ≥2) and P ′
is the derivative of P. Note that P is bounded from below (Problem 2(i)).
This model is called the classical P(φ)1+d model.
It is easy to see that the Lagrangian density for (14.2) is given by
LP(x) := 1
2
n
˙φ(x)2 −(∇φcl(x))2 −m2φcl(x)2o
−P(φcl(x)).
Hence the canonical conjugate momentum πcl := ∂LP/∂˙φcl is found to be
πcl = ˙φcl.
Therefore the Hamiltonian Hcl
P of the model is given by
Hcl
P :=
Z
Rd{πcl(x) ˙φcl(x) −LP (x)}dx
= 1
2
Z
Rd{πcl(x)2 + (∇φcl(x))2 + m2φcl(x)}dx +
Z
Rd P(φcl(x))dx.
By using (14.2), it is shown that, under suitable conditions for φcl and πcl,
dHcl
P /dt = 0, i.e., Hcl
P is independent of time t. Hence Hcl
P is written in
terms of the time-zero ﬁelds:
Hcl
P = 1
2
Z
Rd{πcl(0, x)2 + (∇φcl(0, x))2 + m2φcl(0, x)}dx
+
Z
Rd P(φcl(0, x))dx.
(14.4)
With these preliminaries, we now deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld version of the
above classical model. As the time-zero ﬁelds of the quantum ﬁeld model,
we take the representation {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} of the Heisenberg
CCR over SR(Rd) given by (10.15) and (10.16).1
Then the regularized
quantum version of the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (14.4) is given
1Of course, one can take other representations of the Heisenberg CCR. Generally speak-
ing, it may be an interesting theme to clarify dependences of model constructions on
representations of CCR.

by the second quantization Hb of ω (see (10.14)), which is the Hamilto-
nian of the relativistic free neutral KG ﬁeld (for heuristic arguments, see
Problem 2 in Chapter 10). To deﬁne a quantum version of the second term
R
Rd P(φcl(0, x))dx on the right hand side of (14.4), however, we need some
regularizations, because the rth power φ0(x)r of the operator-valued dis-
tribution kernel φ0(x) of φ0(f) has no mathematical meaning for all r ≥2.
To avoid this diﬃculty, we use the operator
φκ(x) := φκ(0, x),
(14.5)
the time-zero operator of the free quantum KG ﬁeld φκ(t, x) with mo-
mentum cutoﬀκ > 0 (see (10.78)).
Then φκ(x)r is well-deﬁned for all
r ≥1 and x ∈Rd. By (10.78) and estimate (5.88), we see that, for all
Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)),
∥φκ(x)rΨ∥≤CΨ,r∥gκ,x∥r
L2(Rd) =
CΨ,r
(2π)dr/2

χκ

where CΨ,r ≥0 is a constant independent of x ∈Rd. Hence, for all g ∈
L1(Rd) and r ∈N, the Bochner integral
R
Rd g(x)φκ(x)rΨdx exists, because
R
Rd ∥g(x)φκ(x)rΨ∥dx ≤C
R
Rd |g(x)|dx < ∞with a constant C > 0.
We also need a Wick product regularization of φκ(x)r, i.e., instead of
φκ(x)r, we use the Wick product
: φκ(x)r : (=: ΦS(gκ,x)r :)
deﬁned on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)) (for the deﬁnition of the Wick product : · :, see
Problem 13 in Chapter 5). It follows from Problem 13(vi) in Chapter 5
that
: φκ(x)r : = φκ(x) : φκ(x)r−1 :

form:

j=0
crφκ(x)j,
where each cr is a constant independent of x.
Hence, for all Ψ ∈

Rd g(x) : φκ(x)r : Ψdx exists. There-
fore, for the Wick product : P(φκ(x)) : deﬁned by

770
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
the Bochner integral
R
Rd g(x) : P(φκ(x)) : Ψdx exists. Thus we can deﬁne
an operator Vκ,g on Fb(L2(Rd
k)) as follows:
D (Vκ,g) := Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)),
(14.6)
Vκ,gΨ :=
Z
Rd g(x) : P(φκ(x)) : Ψdx,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
(14.7)
The operator Vκ,g is a regularized quantum version corresponding to the
second term (the self-interaction term of φcl) on the right hand side of
(14.4). The operator Vκ,g is symbolically written as
Vκ,g =
Z
Rd g(x) : P(φκ(x)) : dx.
The function g is called a space cutoﬀor a volume cutoﬀ.
Let g ∈L1(Rd) and g ≥0. Then the Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld
model corresponding to the classical theory described by (14.2) is deﬁned
by
Hκ,g := Hb + Vκ,g.
(14.8)
It is easy to see that Fb,ﬁn(D(ω)) ∩Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)) is a subset of D(Hκ,g) =
D(Hb) ∩D(Vκ,g). Hence Hκ,g is densely deﬁned. Moreover, Vκ,g is a sym-
metric operator and bounded from below (Problem 2(ii)–(iii)). Thus we see
that Hκ,g is a symmetric operator and bounded from below. The quantum
ﬁeld model with the Hamiltonian Hκ,g is called the P(φ)1+d model with
momentum cutoﬀκ and space cutoﬀg (or a cutoﬀP(φ)1+d model
simply). This model is not fully relativistic and only “approximately” rel-
ativistic, because it has cutoﬀs. The analysis of this model should be re-
garded as a ﬁrst step towards the construction of a P(φ)1+d model without
cutoﬀs which is expected to be a completely relativistic P(φ)1+d model.
With regard to the cutoﬀP(φ)1+d model, functional integral methods are
useful in addition to operator theoretical methods.
The goal of the analysis of the cutoﬀmodel Hκ,g is to show that the
cutoﬀtheory has a limit in a suitable sense as κ →∞(removal of the
ultraviolet cutoﬀ) and g(x) →1 (removal of the space cutoﬀ) and to prove
that the limiting theory is non-trivial (i.e., inequivalent to a free QFT),
satisfying the axioms of relativistic QFT. But it turns out that this is a
very diﬃcult problem. So far the following results are known (only rough
statements are given; for more exact statements, see the references cited2):
2The literature on P (φ)1+d models is in the vast numbers and hence we mainly cite
books in which detailed reviews on the studies of the models are given.
 

Models in QFT
771
(1) In the case d = 1 (i.e., the case of the two-dimensional space-time),
a P(φ)2 model without cutoﬀs exists and is non-trivial, satisfying the
Wightman axioms [Glimm and Jaﬀe (1985, 1987); Simon (1974)].
(2) In the case d = 2, a φ4
3 model without cutoﬀs exists and is non-trivial,
satisfying the Wightman axioms [Brydges et al. (1983); Fern´andez
et al. (1992); Glimm and Jaﬀe (1985, 1987)].
(3) In the case d ≥4, a construction of φ4
d model without cutoﬀs using a
lattice approximation gives a trivial theory ([Aizenman (1981, 1982);
Ezawa and Arai (1988); Fern´andez et al. (1992); Fr¨ohlich (1982)] and
[Arai et al. (2016), Chapter 3]).
The result (3) with d = 4 (the most interesting case) may discourage one,
because it suggests absence of non-trivial φ4
4 theories without cutoﬀs in its
conventional form. But one can also consider it as a suggestion that a com-
pletely new approach may be needed to construct a non-trivial relativistic
QFT in the 4-dimensional space-time with a possible change of the conven-
tional notion of quantum ﬁeld. The problem of constructing a non-trivial
relativistic QFT in the 4-dimensional space-time as well as a φ4
4 theory is
still left open. This problem is closely related to one of the millennium
problems [Jaﬀe and Witten (2000)].
14.2.2
Scalar quantum electrodynamics
Charged spin-zero particles (e.g., π± mesons) interact with the quantum
radiation ﬁeld. The quantum ﬁeld of charged spin-zero particles is given
by a charged quantum scalar ﬁeld (see Section 10.16). Therefore one is
led to consider a model of a charged quantum scalar ﬁeld interacting with
the quantum radiation ﬁeld.
This class of QFT is called scalar quan-
tum electrodynamics. See, e.g., [Itzykson and Zuber (1980), 6-1-4] for
heuristic physical arguments and [Arai (1991)] for a rigorous deﬁnition of
the Hamiltonian of a scalar quantum electrodynamics with momentum and
space cutoﬀs.
14.2.3
Non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld theories
We have considered a self-interacting non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld in Sub-
section 9.7.2, which is deﬁned through a perturbation of the free bosonic
quantum de Broglie ﬁeld. In this subsection, we deﬁne a ﬁnite volume ver-
sion of it which is a starting point for construction and analysis of inﬁnite
volume theories of a self-interacting non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld. So let us
 

772
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
consider the QFT on the cubic box VL described in Section 9.9. We use
the notation there. For each κ > 0, we introduce the point-like quantum
ﬁeld ψκ(x) on VL (x ∈VL) with momentum cutoﬀκ by
ψκ(x) :=
X
k∈ΓL,κ
aL(k)φk(x)
(14.9)
acting in the boson Fock space Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), where
ΓL,κ := {k ∈ΓL||kj| ≤κ, j = 1, . . . , d}.
The
reader
is
asked
to
compute
commutation
relations
which
{ψκ(x), ψκ(x)∗|x ∈VL} obeys (see Problem 3).
Let W : VL →R be continuous satisfying W(x) = W(−x), ∀x ∈VL.
Then it is easy to see that, for all x, y ∈Rd,
Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) ⊂D(ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y))
and, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)),
Z
VL×VL
|W(x −y)| ∥ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y)Ψ∥dxdy < ∞.
Hence the Bochner integral
Z
VL×VL
W(x −y)ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y)Ψdxdy
exists. Therefore we can deﬁne a linear operator H(L)
I,κ (W) on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL))
as follows:
D(H(L)
I,κ (W)) := Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)),
(14.10)
H(L)
I,κ (W)Ψ :=
Z
VL×VL
W(x −y)ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y)Ψdxdy,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
(14.11)
Note that
H(L)
I,κ (W) = 0
on C ⊕ℓ2(ΓL) ⊕{0} ⊕{0} ⊕· · · ⊂Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
It is easy to see that H(L)
I,κ (W) is a symmetric operator.
Since H(L)
I,κ (W) annihilates two particles and creates two particles, it
follows that H(L)
I,κ (W) leaves each n-particle space left invarant, i.e., it pre-
serves the particle number.

As a generalization of the kinetic energy ENR of a non-relativistic free
particle (see (9.35)), we take as the kinetic energy function of a non-
relativistic free boson a non-negative continuous function ǫ : Rd →[0, ∞).
Then we consider a model of self-interacting bosons whose Hamiltonian is
of the form

I,κ (W) as is shown below.
Let ℓ0(ΓL) be the space of functions f : ΓL →C such that supp f

considerable number of articles on the model have been published. Here we

14.3
Purely Fermionic Field Models
A purely fermionic ﬁeld model is a model which describes only a self-
interaction of a Fermi ﬁeld and/or an interaction among Fermi ﬁelds of
diﬀerent kinds. As in the case of purely bosonic ﬁeld models, also purely
fermionic ﬁeld models are classiﬁed into relativistic ones and non-relativistic
ones.
14.3.1
A model of a self-interacting quantum Dirac ﬁeld
In Chapter 12, we considered a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld on the 4-
dimensional space-time. As in the case of quantum scalar ﬁelds, one can
consider models of a self-interacting quantum Dirac ﬁeld. Here we consider
only one model whose classical ﬁeld equation is given by a non-linear Dirac
equation
(iγµ∂µ −M)ψ(x) = λ[ψ(x)γµψ(x)]γµψ(x)
for ψ : M4 →C4, where λ ∈R denotes a coupling constant. A Lagrangian
density for this equation is given by
ψ(x)(iγµ∂µ −M)ψ(x) −λ
2 [ψ(x)γµψ(x)][ψ(x)γµψ(x)].
It follows that the interaction part in the classical Hamiltonian is
(λ/2)
R
R3[ψ(x)γµψ(x)][ψ(x)γµψ(x)]dx.
But the quantum ﬁeld version of
this quantity makes no sense unless a momentum cutoﬀand a space cutoﬀ
are introduced.
Hence, in what follows, we ﬁrst deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld
Hamiltonian with cutoﬀs.
Let ψg(t, x) be given by (12.170) and, for each κ > 0,
Ψκ(x) := ψχκ(0, x),
(14.19)
where χκ is given by (10.77). The operator Ψκ(x) is called the time-zero
quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀκ. It follows that Ψκ(x)
is a bounded linear operator on the fermion Fock space FD (see (12.117))
(see also Problem 4). By (12.172), we have
∥Ψκ(x)∥≤Cκ,
where Cκ := ∥χκ∥L2(R3)/
p
(2π)3 = 4πκ3/3
p
(2π)3. Hence
∥[Ψκ(x)γµΨκ(x)][Ψκ(x)γµΨκ(x)]∥≤C4
κ.
Therefore, for each real-valued function g ∈L1(R3), the Bochner integral
HI(g, κ) :=
Z
R3 g(x)[Ψκ(x)γµΨκ(x)][Ψκ(x)γµΨκ(x)]dx
 

776
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
exists as a bounded operator on FD. Using the property
γ0(γµ)∗γ0 = γµ,
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
one sees that Ψκ(x)γµΨκ(x) is a bounded self-adjoint operator.
Hence
it follows that HI(g, κ) is a bounded self-adjoint operator. The operator
HI(g, κ) describes a self-interaction of a quantum Dirac ﬁeld with cutoﬀs.
Let HD be the Hamiltonian of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of mass M (see
(12.146)). Then the Hamiltonian of the quantum ﬁeld model with cutoﬀs
corresponding to the above classical model is deﬁned by
Hg,κ := HD + HI(g, κ).
Since HI(g, κ) is bounded, it follows from the Kato-Rellich theorem that
Hg,κ is a self-adjoint operator on FD and bounded from below.
Remark 14.1. There is a two-dimensional space-time version of the above
model, called the Thirring model [Thirring (1958)].
The massless
Thirring model (the case M = 0) without cutoﬀs is exactly soluble in a
sense and has been extensively studied in both physics and mathematical
physics literatures (e.g., [Carey, Ruijsenaars and Wright (1985); Ruijsenaars
(1982)] for mathematically rigorous analyses). Also the massive Thirring
model (the case M > 0) without cutoﬀs has interesting structures (see,
e.g., [Benfatto, Falco and Mastropietro (2009)] for a recent mathematical
study).
14.3.2
A non-relativistic self-interacting Fermi ﬁeld
model—The BCS model
One can consider a fermionic version of the model discussed in Subsection
14.2.3. A diﬀerence from the bosonic ﬁeld model is in taking into account
spin degrees of freedom.
For simplicity, we consider a quantum ﬁeld of
non-relativistic fermions with spin 1/2 (typically non-relativistic electrons)
on a cubic box VL (see (9.86)). The Hilbert space of state vectors for a
fermion of spin 1/2 can be taken to be
HL := ℓ2(ΓL) ⊕ℓ2(ΓL)
in the momentum representation. Then the Fermion Fock space
FNRF := Ff(HL)
over HL becomes the Hilbert space for a Fermi ﬁeld to be considered.
 

Models in QFT
777
We denote by bL(f) (f = (f+, f−) ∈HL) the fermion annihilation
operator on FNRF. For each k ∈ΓL and s = ±, we deﬁne an operator
bs(k) by
b+(k) := bL(δk, 0),
b−(k) := bL(0, δk),
where δk ∈ℓ2(ΓL) is deﬁned by δk(k′) := δkk′, k′ ∈ΓL. It follows that, for
all s, s′ = ± and k, k′ ∈ΓL, bs(k)# is bounded with ∥bs(k)#∥= 1 and
{bs(k), bs′(k′)∗} = δss′δkk′,
{bs(k), bs′(k′)} = 0,
{bs(k)∗, bs′(k′)∗} = 0.
For each κ > 0 and s = ±, we deﬁne a cutoﬀFermi ﬁeld ψκ,s(x) (x ∈VL)
by
ψκ,s(x) :=
X
k∈ΓL,κ
bs(k)φk(x).
(14.20)
This is a bounded operator with
∥ψκ,s(x)∥≤

.
One can also ﬁnd anti-commutation relations which {ψκ,s(x), ψκ,s(x)∗|s =
±, x ∈VL} obeys (see Problem 5).
Let W : VL →R be as in Subsection 14.2.3. Then, as in the case of the
operator H(L)
I,κ (W) in Subsection 14.2.3, one can show that
GI,κ(W) :=
X
s,s′=±
Z
VL×VL
W(x −y)ψκ,s(x)∗ψκ,s′(x)∗ψκ,s′(y)ψκ,s(y)dxdy
is a bounded self-adjoint operator on FNRF.
This operator describes a
self-interaction of the Fermi ﬁeld ψκ,s(x). It follows that
GI,κ(W) := 1

The total Hamiltonian of the model we consider is deﬁned by
HBCS := dΓf(ǫ) + GI,κ(W),
where dΓf(ǫ) denotes the fermion second quantization operator of ǫ on
FNRF.
Since GI,κ is a bounded self-adjoint operator, it follows from
the Kato-Rellich theorem that HBCS is self-adjoint and bounded from be-
low. The Hamiltonian HBSC is called the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer)
Hamiltonian [Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieﬀer (1957)].
It is used as a

starting point to explain superconductivity, a phenomenon in which the
electric resistance of a metal vanishes below a critical temperature. Math-
ematical analyses of HBCS (spectral properties, removal of the ultraviolet
cutoﬀκ and the space cutoﬀL, relation to the so-called mean-ﬁeld Hamil-
tonian etc.) are non-trivial. There is a large number of articles on analysis
of HBSC. An earlier important contribution to mathematical analysis of
the BCS model was presented by Kato (1965). For recent studies, see, e.g.,
[Hainzl and Seiringer (2016)] and references therein.
14.4
Models of Bose Fields Interacting with Fermi Fields
14.4.1
Yukawa model
We consider a model of a quantum Dirac ﬁeld interacting with a quantum
scalar ﬁeld in the 4-dimensional space-time. One can take as the Hilbert
space of state vectors of such a model the tensor product Hilbert space
FDS := FD ⊗Fb(L2(R3
k)),
of the fermion Fock space FD for a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld (see (12.117))
and the boson Fock space Fb(L2(R3
k)) for a free quantum scalar ﬁeld. We
denote by HD and Hb the Hamiltonians of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of
mass M ≥0 and the free quantum scalar ﬁeld of mass m ≥0 respectively
(see (12.146) and (10.14)). Then the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the model
to be considered is deﬁned by
H0 := HD ⊗I + I ⊗Hb,
which is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on FDS.
As in the previous interacting ﬁeld models, one has to introduce a space
cutoﬀand a momentum cutoﬀto deﬁne an interaction of a quantum Dirac
ﬁeld and a quantum scalar ﬁeld. Let φκ(x) and Ψκ(x) (κ > 0, x ∈R3) be
given by (14.5) and (14.19) respectively. Let χ ∈L1(R3) be real-valued.
Then, for all Ψ ∈FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3
k)), the Bochner integral
Z
R3 χ(x)(: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x) :) ⊗φκ(x)Ψdx
exists, where : · : denotes Wick product for Ψκ(x)#. Hence, one can deﬁne
an operator HI,χ,κ as follows:
D(HI,χ,κ) := FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3
k)),
HI,χ,κΨ :=
Z
R3 χ(x)(: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x) :) ⊗φκ(x)Ψdx.
 

Models in QFT
779
It follows that HI,χ,κ is a symmetric operator on FDS.
We denote the
closure of HI,χ,κ by the same symbol. The total Hamiltonian of the model
is deﬁned by
Hχ,κ := H0 + HI,χ,κ.
The subspace
DE,ω := ∧ﬁn(D(E))ˆ⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(ω))
is dense in FDS and DE,ω ⊂D(Hχ,κ). Hence Hχ,κ is symmetric. With
regard to the self-adjointness of Hχ,κ, one has the following fact:
Theorem 14.2. The Hamiltonian Hχ,κ is self-adjoint with D(Hχ,κ) =
D(H0) and bounded from below.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈DE,ω. Then, since ∥: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x) : ∥≤Cκ (a constant
independent of x), we have
∥HI,χ,κΨ∥≤Cκ
Z
R3 |χ(x)| ∥I ⊗φκ(x)Ψ∥dx.
By an application of (13.14), we have for all Φ ∈D(H1/2

where C1κ and C2κ are positive constants. It is easy to see that
∥I ⊗H1/2

Ψ∥≤∥H1/2

Hence
∥HI,χ,κΨ∥≤C1κ∥H1/2

For any ε > 0,
C1κ∥H0Ψ∥1/2∥Ψ∥1/2 ≤ε∥H0Ψ∥+ C2
1κ
4ε ∥Ψ∥.
Hence
∥HI,χ,κΨ∥≤ε∥H0Ψ∥+ bε,κ∥Ψ∥
with a constant bε,κ > 0. Note that DE,ω is a core for H0. Hence, by a
limiting argument, the above inequality extends to all Ψ ∈D(H0), showing
that HI,χ,κ is inﬁnitesimally small with respect to H0. Therefore, by the
Kato-Rellich theorem, the desired result follows.
The quantum ﬁeld model whose Hamiltonian is Hχ,κ is called a Yukawa
model with momentum and space cutoﬀs.
The two-dimensional space-time version of the Yukawa model, denoted
Yukawa2, was extensively studied and existence of a Yukawa2 model with-
out cutoﬀs which satisﬁes the Wightman axioms was shown. For a review,
see [Glimm and Jaﬀe (1987), §23.4]. For recent studies of Yukawa models
with cutoﬀs, see, e.g., [Aschbacher et al. (2011); Barbaroux and Guillot
(2009); Takaesu (2011)].
14.4.2
Quantum electrodynamics
The quantum theory describing the interaction of a quantum Dirac ﬁeld
(typically the relativistic quantum electron ﬁeld) with the quantum ra-
diation ﬁeld is called quantum electrodynamics (QED). The QED of
the quantum electron ﬁeld, as a physical theory, predicts quantum electro-
magnetic phenomena with surprisingly high precision [Kinoshita (1990)],
although the predictions are based on formal perturbations theories with
renormalization procedures (e.g., [Scharf (1989); Steinmann (2000)]). In
spite of the success of QED as physics, it still remains to show the ex-
istence of QED in the four-dimensional space-time as a mathematically
well-deﬁned theory.
This is one of the most important (but most diﬃ-
cult) problems in mathematical physics. An axiomatic treatment of QED
is found in [Strocchi (2013)].
As is mentioned in Remark 11.1, one needs an indeﬁnite metric space
to construct a model of QED in a manifestly covariant way.
Here, for
simplicity, we present the Hamiltonian of a cutoﬀmodel of QED in the
 

Models in QFT
781
Coulomb gauge which is deﬁned as a self-adjoint operator on the tensor
product Hilbert space
FQED := FD ⊗Frad
of the fermion Fock space FD (see (12.117)) for the quantum Dirac ﬁeld
and the boson Fock space Frad with d = 3 (see (11.17)) for the quantum
radiation ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge.
Let Ψκ(x) (x ∈R3) be the time-zero quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momen-
tum cutoﬀκ > 0 (see (14.19)) and
Aκ
j (x) := Aρκ,j(0, x),
(14.21)
where Aρκ,j(t, x) (t ∈R) is deﬁned by (11.36) with d = 3 and ρκ(k) =
χ[0,κ](|k|), k ∈R3. The operator Aκ
j (x) is self-adjoint. As in the case of
the Yukawa interaction HI,χ,κ in Subsection 14.4.1, it is shown that, for each
g ∈L1(R3) and Ψ ∈FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3) ⊕L2(R3)), the Bochner integral
Z
R3 g(x) : Ψκ(x)∗αjΨκ(x) : ⊗Aκ
j (x)Ψdx (j = 1, 2, 3)
exists. Hence one can deﬁne an operator HI as follows:
D(HI) := FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3) ⊕L2(R3)),
HIΨ :=
3
X
j=1
Z
R3 g(x) : Ψκ(x)∗αjΨκ(x) : ⊗Aκ
j (x)Ψdx, Ψ ∈D(HI).
It is easy to see that HI is symmetric and hence closable.
We denote
the closure of HI by the same symbol.
The closed symmetric operator
HI represents the interaction between the quantum Dirac ﬁeld and the
quantum radiation ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀκ and space-cutoﬀg.
In the Coulomb gauge, the self-interaction term of the quantum Dirac
ﬁeld appears in the form
HIIΨ := 1
8π
Z
R3×R3
h(x)h(y)
|x −y|
: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x)Ψκ(y)∗Ψκ(y) : Ψdxdy
(Bochner integral), where Ψ ∈FQED and h ∈L2(R3) is a space cutoﬀ
such that h ≥0 and
R
R3 |ˆh(k)|2/|k|2dk < ∞. Since Ψκ(x) is bounded with
operator norm independent of x, one can show that the norm of the right
hand side is less than or equal to
C∥Ψ∥
Z
R3×R3
h(x)h(y)
|x −y| dxdy ≤4πC∥Ψ∥
Z
R3
|ˆh(k)|2
|k|2
dk < ∞,
where C > 0 is a constant. Hence it follows that HII is a bounded self-
adjoint operator on FQED.
 

782
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The total Hamiltonian of the model is deﬁned by
H := HD ⊗I + I ⊗Hrad + qHI + q2HII,
where HD and Hrad are the free Hamiltonian of the quantum Dirac ﬁeld
and the quantum radiation ﬁeld respectively (see (12.146) and (11.34)) and
q ∈R denotes the charge of the Dirac particle under consideration.
In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 14.2, one can prove that H is
self-adjoint and bounded from below with D(H) = D(HD⊗I)∩D(I ⊗Hrad).
For further analyses of the model and related ones, see, e.g., [Barbarroux
et al. (2004); Takaesu (2009); Wakita (1976)].
14.4.3
Supersymmetric quantum ﬁelds
In Section 7.14, we mentioned supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theory
(SQFT) as supersymmetric quantum mechanics with inﬁnite degrees of
freedom and constructed an abstract supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld model
(F(H , K ), Γ, QS, dΓ(S∗S, SS∗)) (see Remark 7.8). This abstract model
produces concrete supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld models according to the
choice of (H , K , S) (see, e.g., [Arai (1993b)]).
A feature of supersym-
metric quantum ﬁeld models is that they may be less singular than non-
supersymmetric ones in the sense that, in supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld
models, some cancellations of ultraviolet divergences may occur. Super-
symmetric quantum ﬁeld models in the two-dimensional space-time with-
out ultraviolet cutoﬀ(but with space cutoﬀ) have been constructed (see,
e.g., [Jaﬀe et al. (1988)] and references therein).
14.5
Particle-ﬁeld Interaction Models
There are models which describe interactions of quantum particles with a
quantum ﬁeld (mainly a Bose ﬁeld). One of the most important classes
of models in this category is non-relativistic QED which is the quan-
tum theory describing non-relativistic charged particles (typically non-
relativistic electrons) interacting with the quantum radiation ﬁeld, explain-
ing with relatively high precisions electromagnetic phenomena in “non-
relativistic regions” (for physics of non-relativistic QED, see, e.g., [Barut
(1980); Healy (1982)] and, for mathematically rigorous theories, see, e.g.,
[Spohn (2004)]).
For simplicity, let us consider the case where the quantum ﬁeld under
consideration is a Bose ﬁeld. The Hilbert space of state vectors of a model
 

Models in QFT
783
of this type is taken to be of the form
Fpb := Hp ⊗Fb(H ),
where Hp is a Hilbert space for the particle system and H is a one-particle
Hilbert space for the Bose ﬁeld. A general form of the Hamiltonian of such
a model is given by
Hpb := Hp ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb) + Hint,
where Hp is a self-adjoint operator on Hp, denoting the Hamiltonian of
the particle system, dΓb(hb) is the boson second quantization operator of
a non-negative injective self-adjoint operator hb on H (the one-particle
Hamiltonian of the Bose ﬁeld) and Hint is a symmetric operator, denoting
an interaction of the particle system with the Bose ﬁeld.
Remark 14.2. From a more general point of view, the Hilbert space Hp
can be a Hilbert space of state vectors of any quantum system (not neces-
sarily a quantum-particle system in its concrete realization). For example,
Hp may be taken to be H ′ ⊗Ff(K ), the tensor product of a Hilbert
space H ′ and the fermion Fock space over a Hilbert space K , so that
Fpb = H ′ ⊗Ff(K ) ⊗Fb(H ). As is seen, this Hilbert space may be
a most general Hilbert space in the sense that it gives a framework for a
quantum theory describing an interaction of a quantum system (associated
with H ′) with a Bose ﬁeld and a Fermi ﬁeld.
Before discussing concrete models in the category under consideration,
we want to make a remark on a general feature concerning spectral analysis
of Hpb. To be deﬁnite, we consider the case where Hp and hb have the
following spectral structures:
σd(Hp) = {En}N
n=1,
E1 < E2 < · · · < En < En+1 < · · · < Σ,
σess(Hp) = [Σ, ∞),
σ(hb) = σc(hb) = [m, ∞)
with N < ∞or N = ∞(we use the convention that σess(Hp) = ∅⇐⇒Σ =
∞, the case where the spectrum of Hp is purely discrete) and m ≥0. In
this case we have by an application of Theorem 5.3
σp(dΓb(hb)) = {0},
σc(dΓb(hb)) = [m, ∞),
where the eigenvalue 0 is simple and its eigenvector is the Fock vacuum ΩH
up to constant multiples. Hence, by the spectral theory of tensor products
 

784
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
of self-adjoint operators (see Theorems 3.8 and 3.12), the spectrum of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian
Hpb,0 := Hp ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb)
is identiﬁed as follows (Fig.14.1):
σp(Hpb,0) = {En}N
n=1,
σc(Hpb,0) = [E1 + m, ∞).

embedded eigenvalues
Fig. 14.1
The spectrum of Hpb,0 (the case m < Σ −E1)
As is seen, any eigenvalue Ej more than or equal to E1 +m is embedded
in the continuous spectrum of Hpb,0, i.e., it is an embedded eigenvalue of
Hpb,0. In particular, if m = 0 (the massless case), then all the eigenvalues
of Hpb,0 are embedded ones. Hence the spectral analysis of Hpb includes
the perturbation problem of embedded eigenvalues, which are diﬃcult to
treat in general, because, in this case, the method of the standard analytic
(regular) perturbation theory (e.g., [Kato (1976); Reed and Simon (1978)])
is not valid any more. One must seek essentially new methods to solve the
perturbation problem of embedded eigenvalues in quantum ﬁeld theory.3 In
the late 1990’s, breakthroughs on this problem have been brought by Arai-
Hirokawa (1997) and Bach-Fr¨ohlich-Sigal (1998a, 1998b). For a review on
this aspect, we refer the reader to [Hiroshima (2005)].
We now describe some models.
14.5.1
Nelson model
In the vHM model in the context of nuclear physics, the ﬁxed sources are
nucleons (see Section 13.1). But one can consider more realistic models by

turbation problem of embedded eigenvalues have been established (see, e.g., [Reed and
Simon (1978), §XII.6]).

taking into account the motion of nucleons and the iso-spin of the π-meson.
Below we deﬁne the simplest one among such models.
We consider a d-dimensional system of N non-relativistic quantum par-
ticles of mass M > 0 interacting with a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld. We
suppose that the particles are in a potential V : (Rd)N →R, a Borel mea-
surable function a.e. ﬁnite. A choice of (Hp, Hp, H , hb) for the model is
given as follows:
Hp = L2((Rd)N), Hp = −
N
X
j=1
1
2M ∆xj + V (a Schr¨odinger operator),
H = L2(Rd), hb = ω,
where ∆xj is the generalized Laplacian in the variable xj ∈Rd (we write
a point x ∈(Rd)N as x = (x1, . . . , xN), xj ∈Rd, j = 1, . . . , N) and ω
is deﬁned by (10.2) (if the quantum scalar ﬁeld under consideration is the
π0-meson ﬁeld, then m > 0, denoting the mass of a π0-meson). Hence, in
the present case,
Fpb = L2((Rd)N) ⊗Fb(L2(Rd)) ∼=
Z ⊕
(Rd)N Fb(L2(Rd))dx,
where
R ⊕
(Rd)N Fb(L2(Rd))dx is the constant ﬁbre direct integral over
((Rd)N, dx) with ﬁbre Fb(L2(Rd)) (see Section 2.8).
Remark 14.3. If one takes into account the statistics of the N particles
(fermions or bosons), then L2((Rd)N) should be replaced by ∧NL2(Rd) in
the case of fermions and by L2
sym((Rd)N) in the case of bosons.
To deﬁne an interaction of the quantum particles with the quantum ﬁeld,
it turns out that it is more convenient to use the identiﬁcation of Fpb with
R ⊕
(Rd)N Fb(L2(Rd))dx. Hence, in what follows, we use this identiﬁcation.
Let φκ(x) be given by (14.5) as before. Then, for each j = 1, . . . , N,
one can deﬁne a mapping φκ,j : (Rd)N 7→L(Fb(L2(Rd))) by
φκ,j(x) := φκ(xj),
x = (x1, . . . , xN).
Since, for each x ∈Rd, φκ(x) is self-adjoint, it follows that φκ,j is a self-
adjoint mapping. Hence, by Theorem 2.7, the direct integral operator
ˆφκ,j :=
Z ⊕
Rd φκ,j(x)dx
is self-adjoint. An interaction of the quantum particles with the quantum
scalar ﬁeld is given by PN
j=1 gj ˆφκ,j with gj’s being real parameters denoting

coupling constants.
Thus one arrives at a model whose Hamiltonian is
deﬁned by
HN(κ) := Hp + Hb +
N
X
j=1
gj ˆφκ,j,
where Hb = dΓb(ω).
This model is called the Nelson model [Nelson
(1964)]. One usually assumes the following:
(N) The Schr¨odinger operator Hp is self-adjoint and bounded from below.4
Theorem
14.3. Under assumption (N), HN(κ) is self-adjoint
with
D(HN(κ)) = D(Hp) ∩D(Hb) and bounded from below.
Proof. Let HI := PN
j=1 gj ˆφκ,j. Then it follows from the proof of Theorem
14.2 that D(Hb) ⊂D(HI) and, for any ε > 0, there exists a constant cε > 0
such that
∥HIΨ∥≤ε∥HbΨ∥+ cε∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(Hb).
Since Hp is self-adjoint, bounded from below and Hb ≥0, it follows that
H0 := Hp + Hb is self-adjoint and bounded from below. In particular, H0
is closed. Therefore, by Theorem 1.4, there exists a constant C > 0
∥HpΨ∥+ ∥HbΨ∥≤C(∥H0Ψ∥+ ∥Ψ∥),
Ψ ∈D(H0).
Hence
∥HIΨ∥≤εC∥H0Ψ∥+ (cε + εC)∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H0).
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, it follows from the Kato-Rellich theorem that
HN(κ) = H0 + HI is self-adjoint with D(HN(κ)) = D(H0) and bounded
from below.
Nelson (1964) proved that, in the case where m > 0, d = 3 and V = 0,
the ultraviolet cutoﬀκ can be removed in the following sense : there exist
a constant Eκ ∈R (this is explicitly given) and a self-adjoint operator H∞
on
R ⊕
(R3)N Fb(L2(R3))dx such that Eκ →−∞(κ →∞) and
s- lim
κ→∞e−it(HN(κ)−Eκ) = e−itH∞,
t ∈R.
(14.22)
This is a surprising result, because it shows that the removal of the
ultraviolet cutoﬀκ can be carried out within the same Hilbert space,
4For self-adjointness of Schr¨odinger operators, see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1975)].
 

Models in QFT

while, in a conventional heuristic picture, the removal of ultraviolet cut-
oﬀmay change the Hilbert space of representation of CCR (recall, e.g.,
the case of the vHM model discussed in Chapter 13). The Nelson’s re-
sult also shows the importance of the topology of convergence for nets
of (unbounded) operators.5
Note also that (14.22) is equivalent to the
strong resolvent convergence of {HN(κ) −Eκ}κ to H∞as κ →∞, i.e.,
limκ→∞(HN(κ) −Eκ −z)−1 = (H∞−z)−1, z ∈C \ R (see, e.g., [Reed and
Simon (1980), Theorem VIII.21]).
It is immediately read oﬀfrom Nelson’s paper [Nelson (1964)] that
(14.22) holds also in the case where m > 0, d = 1, 2, 3 and V is in a suitable
class of functions. For further developments on the removal of ultravio-
let cutoﬀ(ultraviolet renormalization) of the Nelson model, see [Gubinelli
et al. (2014)].
As in the case of other models, existence of a ground state of HN(κ)
has been discussed, mainly in the massless case m = 0 [Bach et al. (1998b);
G´erard (2000); Hiroshima and Sasaki (2008); Spohn (1998)]. In the massive
case m > 0, it is not so diﬃcult to show the existence and uniqueness of
a ground state of HN(κ) under a suitable condition for V , because, in
this case, one can employ the method of constructive quantum ﬁeld theory
[Glimm and Jaﬀe (1968b, 1970, 1985, 1987)]. But, in the massless case
m = 0, infrared problems may occur as mentioned in the case of the massless
vHM model in Chaper 13 (for pioneering work on this aspect, see [Fr¨ohlich
(1973, 1974)]). In fact, it is shown that, in the case d = 3 and N = 1, HN(κ)
without infrared cutoﬀhas no ground state [L¨orrinczi et al. (2002)]. But, if
one uses a non-Fock representation for the time-zero ﬁeld and its canonical
conjugate momentum, one can show that the Hamiltonian without infrared
cutoﬀin this representation has a ground state [Arai (2001b)]. This shows
that, in the Nelson model, existence of a ground state depends on the
choice of representations of the time-zero ﬁeld and its canonical conjugate
momentum (we have seen this kind of phenomena in the vHM model in
Chapter 13). Sasaki (2005) extended the result to the case where V is in a
more general class of functions. Also the existence of a ground state of the
renormalized Hamiltonian H∞without infrared cutoﬀhas been shown by
5In the present case, the strong convergence of one-parameter unitary groups. It is easy
to see that, for all f ∈L2((R3)N) with ∥f∥= 1,
D
f ⊗ΩL2(R3), (HN(κ) −Eκ)f ⊗ΩL2(R3)
E
= ⟨f, Hpf⟩−Eκ →+∞(κ →∞).
Hence, in the weak topology, {HN(κ) −Eκ}κ does not converge.

14.5.2
Pauli-Fierz model in non-relativistic QED
We consider a quantum system of a non-relativistic spin-less charged par-
ticle with charge q and mass M > 0 (typically a non-relativistic electron
with spin degree excluded) interacting with the quantum radiation ﬁeld in
the d-dimensional space Rd with d ≥2. A Hilbert space for the system is
taken to be
FPF := L2(Rd) ⊗Frad,
where Frad is the boson Fock space for the quantum radiation ﬁeld (see
(11.17)). As in the case of the Nelson model, we use the identiﬁcation
FPF =
Z ⊕
Rd Fraddx.
We denote the d-dimensional version of the quantum radiation ﬁeld
Aκ
j (x) (j = 1, . . . , d) with an ultraviolet cutoﬀκ > 0 (see (14.21)) by the
same symbol. Since Aκ
j (·) : Rd 7→L(Frad) is a self-adjoint mapping, the
direct integral operator
ˆAj,κ :=
Z ⊕
Rd Aκ
j (x)dx.
is self-adjoint.
Suppose in addition that the charged particle is in a potential V : Rd →
R which is Borel measurable and a.e. ﬁnite. Then a Hamiltonian of such a
quantum system is deﬁned by
HPF :=
d
X
j=1
1
2M (ˆpj −q ˆAj,κ)2 + V + Hrad,
(14.23)
where ˆpj := −iDj (the jth momentum operator) and Hrad is the free Hamil-
tonian of the quantum radiation ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge (see (11.34)).
This model is called the Pauli-Fierz model for a spin-less charged particle
with an ultraviolet cutoﬀκ [Pauli and Fierz (1938)] (originally d = 3).
It is easy to see that the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (14.23) can
be expanded on
DPF := D(∆) ∩D(V ) ∩D(Hrad) ∩[∩d
j=1D(ˆpj ˆAj,κ) ∩D( ˆAj,κˆpj) ∩D( ˆA2

follows from the Coulomb gauge condition k·e(r)(k) = 0, k ∈Rd \{0}, r =
1, . . . , d −1 (Problem 7). Concerning self-adjointness of HPF, we present
only a result in the small coupling case (i.e. the case where |q| is suﬃciently
small). Let
HS(V ) := −1
2M ∆+ V,
which is a Schr¨odinger operator.
Theorem 14.4. Suppose that HS(V ) is self-adjoint and bounded from be-
low. Then there exists a constant q0 > 0 such that, for all |q| < q0, HPF is
self-adjoint and bounded from below with D(HPF) = D(HS(V )) ∩D(Hrad).
Proof. We can write
HPF = HPF,0 + Hint
on DPF,
where
HPF,0 := HS(V ) + Hrad = −1
2M ∆+ Hrad + V,
the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the model, and

Under the present assumption, we can assume that HS(V ) ≥0 without loss
of generality.6 Then HPF,0 ≥0. Hence
∥Ψ∥≤∥(HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(HPF,0).
It follows from an application of Theorem 1.4 that there exists a constant
C > 0 such that

Ψ∥≤C∥(HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥,
∥HradΨ∥≤C∥(HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(HPF,0).
By an application of Proposition 5.12(iii), there exists a constant cj(κ) > 0
such that, for all Ψ ∈D(Hrad), ∥ˆA2
j,κΨ∥≤cj(κ)∥(Hrad + 1)Ψ∥. Hence
∥ˆA2
j,κΨ∥≤cj(κ)(C∥HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥+ ∥Ψ∥), Ψ ∈D(HPF,0).
6If it is not the case, then one needs only to replace by HS(V ) with HS(V )′ := HS(V )−
inf σ(HS(V )) ≥0 so that HS(V ) = HS(V )′ + inf σ(HS(V )).

Therefore DPF = D(HPF,0) and there exist positive constants a and b
depending on κ such that
∥HintΨ∥≤(a|q| + b|q|2)∥(HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥.
Let q0 := (−a +
√
a2 + 4b)/2b > 0. Then (a|q| + b|q|2) < 1 for all |q| < q0.
Hence, for all |q| < q0, we can apply the Kato-Rellich theorem to conclude
that HPF ↾D(HPF,0) is self-adjoint and bounded from below. Since a self-
adjoint operator has no non-trivial symmetric extension, HPF is self-adjoint
with D(HPF) = D(HPF,0) and bounded from below.
Remark 14.4. By using other methods, one can show that, for all q ∈R,
HPF is self-adjoint and bounded from below for a class of V . This result
can be extended to a many particle system interacting with the quantum
radiation ﬁeld. For the details, see [Hasler and Herbst (2008); Hiroshima
(2000)].
The Pauli-Fierz type models have been extensively studied. Arai (1983)
gave a ﬁrst complete analysis of the Pauli Fierz model HPF in the dipole
approximation (i.e.
the model HPF with ˆAj,κ replaced by Aρ,j(0, 0)) in
the case where d = 3 and V (x) = Mω0x2/2 (a harmonic oscillator po-
tential; ω0 > 0 is a constant), including the existence of a ground state
without infrared cutoﬀand of resonances, the identiﬁcation of the spec-
tra of the Hamiltonian, scattering theory and removal of ultraviolet cutoﬀ.
The existence of a ground state of the Pauli-Fierz model without infrared
cutoﬀwas shown by Griesemer et al. (2001) (see [Lieb and Loss (2003)]

for further developments). For reviews on mathematical analysis of non-
relativistic QED and related topics, see, e.g., [Derezi´nski and Siedentop
(2006); Hiroshima (2004)]. An interesting (but diﬃcult) open problem on
the Pauli-Fierz model is to remove ultraviolet cutoﬀ, where an inﬁnite mass
renormalization may be necessary.
14.5.3
Generalized spin-boson model
One can consider a general quantum system S interacting with a Bose ﬁeld
acting in the abstract boson Fock space Fb(Hb) over a Hilbert space Hb
(a one-particle Hilbert space). The Hilbert space for the composite system
is given by
FGSB := HS ⊗Fb(Hb),
where HS is a Hilbert space for the quantum system S. We denote by HS
the Hamiltonian of the quantum system S which is a self-adjoint operator
on HS and by hb the one-particle Hamiltonian of the Bose ﬁeld which is
a nonnegative and injective self-adjoint operator on Hb. We suppose that
the interaction between the quantum system S and the Bose ﬁeld is given
by an operator of the form
HI(B, g) :=
J
X
j=1
Bj ⊗ΦS(gj),
where, J ∈N, Bj is a symmetric operator on HS and ΦS(gj) is the Segal
ﬁeld operator with test vector gj ∈Hb (we set B = (B1, . . . , BJ), g :=
(g1, . . . , gJ)). Then the total Hamiltonian of the interacting system is given
by
HGSB := HS ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb) + HI(B, g).
This model is called a generalized spin-boson (GSB) model [Arai and
Hirokawa (1997)], which covers a range of particle-boson interaction models
(for recent studies on the GSB model, see, e.g., [Takaesu (2010); Teranishi
(2015)]).
Example 14.1. The standard spin-boson model is realized by taking
(HS, HS, Hb, hb, B, g) as follows:
HS = C2,
, HS = µ
2 σ1 (µ > 0),
Hb = L2(Rd
k),
hb = ω,
J = 1,
B1 = σ3,
g1 = g ∈L2(Rd
k) (g∗= g),
 

792
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where σ1 and σ3 are two of the Pauli matrices (see (12.2)) and ω is a
nonnegative Borel measurable function on Rd
k. Hence HGSB in this case
takes the form
HSB = µ
2 σ1 ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(ω) + σ3 ⊗ΦS(g).
This model is used as a model of an atom with two energy levels whose gap
is µ, interacting with a photon ﬁeld (in this case ω(k) = |k|, k ∈Rd). For
recent work on the spin-boson model, see [Bach et al. (2016); De Roecka
et al. (2015); Hasler and Herbst (2011)] and references therein.
14.5.4
Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian
Derezi´nski and G´erard (1999) introduced a uniﬁed version of the Nelson
type model and the GSB model in an abstract form as shown below. We
continue to use the notation in the preceding subsection. To deﬁne the
model, it is easier to employ the natural identiﬁcation
FGSB = ⊕∞
n=0Fn,
Fn := HS ⊗(⊗n
s Hb)
so that each vector Ψ ∈FGSB is represented as Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 with
Ψ(n) ∈Fn satisfying
∞
X
n=0
∥Ψ(n)∥2 < ∞.
Let v be a densely deﬁned closed operator from HS to HS ⊗Hb. Then
one can deﬁne a linear operator ea∗(v) on FGSB as follows:
D (ea∗(v)) :=

Ψ = {Ψ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈FGSB
Ψ(n−1) ∈D (v ⊗I) , n ≥1,

∥√n(I ⊗Sn)(v ⊗I)Ψ(n−1)∥2 < ∞

,
(ea∗(v)Ψ)(0) := 0,
(ea∗(v)Ψ)(n) := √n(I ⊗Sn)(v ⊗I)Ψ(n−1), n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(ea∗(v)).
Note that (v ⊗I)Ψ(n−1) ∈HS ⊗
 Hb ⊗(⊗n−1

Hb)

.
Remark 14.5. In [Derezi´nski and G´erard (1999)], ea∗(v) is deﬁned only in
the case where v is bounded with D(v) = HS. But, as far as the deﬁnition
of ea∗(v) is concerned, the boundedness of v is not necessary as just shown
above.
 

Models in QFT
793
The operator ea∗(v) is an extended version of the creation operator A(f)∗
on Fb(Hb). Indeed, for a vector f ∈Hb and a densely deﬁned closed
operator B on HS, one deﬁnes a linear operator vf,B ∈L(HS, HS ⊗Hb)
by vf,B(u) := Bu ⊗f, u ∈D(B) ⊂HS. Then it is easy to see
ea∗(vf,B) = B ⊗A(f)∗.
on D(B)ˆ⊗D(A(f)∗).
The adjoint
ea(v) := (ea∗(v))∗
(14.25)
of ea∗(v) gives an extended version of the annihilation operator A(f) (f ∈
Hb). An analogue of the Segal ﬁeld operator is deﬁned by
eφ(v) :=
1
√
2
(ea∗(v) + ea(v)).
(14.26)
A generalization of the Hamiltonian HGSB is given by
HDG := HS ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb) + eφ(v),
which is called a Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian [Derezi´nski and G´erard
(1999)]. For recent studies on Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonians and related sub-
jects, see, e.g., [Møller (2014)] and references therein.
14.5.5
A particle-ﬁeld interaction model in relativistic
QED
One can consider also a system of a Dirac particle interacting with the
quantum radiation ﬁeld. A Hilbert space for such a system is taken to be
FDM := L2(R3; C4) ⊗Frad =
Z ⊕
R3 ⊕4Fraddx.
We denote the mass and the charge of the Dirac particle by M > 0 and
q ∈R respectively. Then a natural total Hamiltonian is given by
HDM :=
3
X
j=1
αj(ˆpj −q ˆAj,κ) + βM + V + Hrad.
where V = (Vij)i,j=1,2,3,4 (Vij : R3 →C ∪{±∞}) is a 4 × 4 Hermi-
tian matrix-valued function on R3. The operator HDM is called a Dirac-
Maxwell operator or a Dirac-Maxwell Hamiltonian [Arai (2001a)].7
7W. Pauli introduced the formal Hamiltonian for HDM with V = 0 in 1933 [Pauli
(1980), (26.9)]. It is cited in [Bloch and Nordsieck (1937)].
 

794
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is shown [Arai (2001a)] that, for a class of V , HDM is essentially
self-adjoint, but, unbounded from above and from below. In the sense that
it is not bounded from below, HDM may be unphysical.8 But, for some
physical phenomena such as the Lamb shift (a very ﬁne energy level shift
observed at the ﬁrst excited state of the hydrogen atom [Kinoshita (1990)],
which cannot be explained in terms of the Dirac operator P3
j=1 αj(−iDj)+
βM + V with V (x) = −e2/(4πε0|x|) being the Coulomb potential (e > 0
is the fundamental electric charge) and the Compton scattering (an elastic
scattering of an electron with a photon), the model explains them to some
extent, although the explanations are based on formal perturbation theories
(see, e.g., [Nishijima (1973)]). On the mathematical side, it is shown that
HDM has a non-relativistic limit in the sense of strong resolvent convergence
which yields the Hamiltonian of the Pauli-Fierz model with spin 1/2 in non-
relativistic QED [Arai (2003, 2006a)]. These facts suggest that, in a range of
physical phenomena, the model may be physical. Hence what is important
will be to clarify in what sense or in what range of physical phenomena the
model is physical without invoking formal perturbation theories.
The operator HDM may be interesting also from purely operator theo-
retical points of view, because HDM is made of objects in a representation
({α1, α2, α3, β}, {ˆqj, ˆpj}3
j=1, {a(r)(f), a(r)(f)∗|r = 1, 2, f ∈L2(R3)}) of the
Cliﬀord algebra associated with R4 and CCR, where ˆqj is the multiplication
operator by the jth variable xj (x = (x1, x2, x3) ∈R3). For a recent study
on HDM, see [Futakuchi and Usui (2014b); Sasaki (2014)].

of the electron and a cloud of the phonons. Let E(p) be the lowest energy of

Weak Convergence of Vectors and
Strong Convergence of Bounded
Linear Operators in Hilbert Spaces
Let H be a complex Hilbert space with inner product ⟨, ⟩(linear in the
second variable) and norm ∥· ∥. A sequence {ψn}∞
n=1 of vectors ψn ∈H is
said to converge weakly to ψ ∈H if, for all φ ∈H ,
lim
n→∞⟨φ, ψn⟩= ⟨φ, ψ⟩.
(A.1)
In this case ψ is called the weak limit of {ψn}∞
n=1 and one writes ψ =
w- limn→∞ψn.
In applications, one often meets the problem when a given sequence of
vectors in a Hilbert space converges weakly. One solution to this problem
is given by the following proposition:
Proposition A.1. Let {ψn}∞
n=1 (ψn ∈H , n ∈H ) be bounded, i.e.,
supn∈N ∥ψn∥< ∞.
Suppose that there exist a vector ψ ∈H
and a
dense subspace D in H
such that, for all φ ∈D, (A.1) holds.
Then
w- limn→∞ψn = ψ.
Proof. There exists a constant C > 0 such that max{∥ψ∥, supn∈N ∥ψn∥} ≤
C. Let φ ∈H . Then, by the density of D, for each ε > 0, there exists
a vector φε ∈D such that ∥φε −φ∥< ε/(3C). By the assumption on the
convergence of {ψn}n, there exists an n0(ε) ∈N such that, for all n ≥n0(ε),
| ⟨φε, ψn⟩−⟨φε, ψ⟩| < ε/3. Using the identity
⟨φ, ψn⟩−⟨φ, ψ⟩= ⟨φ −φε, ψn⟩+ (⟨φε, ψn⟩−⟨φε, ψ⟩) + ⟨φε −φ, ψ⟩
and the Schwarz inequality, we have for all n ≥n0(ε)
| ⟨φ, ψn⟩−⟨φ, ψ⟩| ≤∥φ −φε∥∥ψn∥+ |⟨φε, ψn⟩−⟨φε, ψ⟩| + ∥φε −φ∥∥ψ∥
< ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε.
Hence (A.1) holds.

Remark A.1. The idea of the method used in the proof of Proposition
A.1 is called “ε/3 argument”. It is one of fundamental techniques in math-
ematical analysis.
Proposition A.2. Let K be a Hilbert space and Tn ∈B(H , K ) (n ∈
N) with supn∈N ∥Tn∥< ∞.
Suppose that there exist an operator T ∈
B(H , K ), a dense subspace D in H
and a dense subspace F in K
such that, for all ψ ∈D and φ ∈F, limn→∞⟨φ, Tnψ⟩= ⟨φ, T ψ⟩. Then
w- limn→∞Tn = T (see Subsection 1.3.3).
Proof. For all ψ ∈H , supn∈N ∥Tnψ∥≤(supn∈N ∥Tn∥)∥ψ∥< ∞. Hence,
by Proposition A.1, for all φ ∈K and ψ ∈F, limn→∞⟨φ, Tnψ⟩= ⟨φ, T ψ⟩,
which implies that limn→∞⟨T ∗
nφ, ψ⟩= ⟨T ∗φ, ψ⟩.
Using the fact that
∥T ∗
n∥= ∥Tn∥, we have supn∈N ∥T ∗
nφ∥≤(supn∈N ∥Tn∥)∥φ∥.
Hence, by
Proposition A.1 again, w- limn→∞T ∗
nφ = T ∗φ.
This is equivalent to
w- limn→∞Tn = T .
Proposition A.3. Let K be a Hilbert space and Tn ∈B(H , K ) (n ∈N)
with supn∈N ∥Tn∥< ∞. Suppose that there exist an operator T ∈B(H , K )
and a dense subspace D in H such that, for all ψ ∈D, limn→∞Tnψ = T ψ.
Then s- limn→∞Tn = T .
Proof. We use ε/3 argument mentioned in Remark A.1. Let C be a con-
stant satisfying C > max{supn∈N ∥Tn∥, ∥T ∥}.
Let ψ ∈H .
Then, for
each ε > 0, there exists a vector ψε ∈D such that ∥ψε −ψ∥< ε/(3C).
The present assumption implies that there exists an n0(ε) ∈N such that
∥Tnψε −T ψε∥< ε/3, n ≥n0(ε). Using the identity
Tnψ −T ψ = Tn(ψ −ψε) + Tnψε −T ψε + T (ψε −ψ)
and the triangle inequality, we have for n ≥n0(ε)
∥Tnψ −T ψ∥≤∥Tn∥∥ψ −ψε∥+ ∥Tnψε −T ψε∥+ ∥T ∥∥ψε −ψ∥
< ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε.
Hence the desired result follows.

Operators on a Direct Sum Hilbert
Space
Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces and
H := H1 ⊕H2 = {ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) | ψj ∈Hj, j = 1, 2}
be their direct sum Hilbert space. Recall that the inner product ⟨ψ, φ⟩of
ψ ∈H and φ ∈H is deﬁned by ⟨ψ, φ⟩:= ⟨ψ1, φ1⟩+ ⟨ψ2, φ2⟩. In what
follows, we identify a vector (ψ1, ψ2) ∈H with a column vector
 ψ1

.
Let Ajk (j, k = 1, 2) be a linear operator from Hk to Hj. Then the
operator matrix
A :=
A11 A12
A21 A22

is deﬁned as a linear operator on H as follows:
D(A) := [D(A11) ∩D(A21)] ⊕[D(A12) ∩D(A22)] ,
(B.1)
Aψ =
A11 A12

:=
A11ψ1 + A12ψ2

,
ψ =

ψ2

∈D(A).
(B.2)
If A12 = 0 and A21 = 0, then A is the direct sum operator A11 ⊕A22
(see Remark 4.1). Hence an operator matrix gives a generalization of direct
sum operators.
Lemma B.1. Suppose that D(A11) ∩D(A21) and D(A12) ∩D(A22) are
dense in H1 and H2 respectively. Then D(A) is dense and

(B.4)
and ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) ∈D(B) = [D(A∗
11)∩D(A∗
12)]⊕[D(A∗
21)∩D(A∗
22)]. Then,
for all φ = (φ1, φ2) ∈D(A),
⟨ψ, Aφ⟩= ⟨ψ1, A11φ1 + A12φ2⟩+ ⟨ψ2, A21φ1 + A22φ2⟩
= ⟨A∗
11ψ1 + A∗
21ψ2, φ1⟩+ ⟨A∗
12ψ1 + A∗
22ψ2, φ2⟩
= ⟨Bψ, φ⟩.
Hence ψ ∈D(A∗) and A∗ψ = Bψ. Thus (B.3) holds.
Theorem B.1.
(i) Let Ajj ∈B(Hj), j = 1, 2 and D(A21) and D(A12) be dense in H1
and H2 respectively. Then
A∗=

(B.5)
(ii) Let A12 ∈B(H2, H1), A21 ∈B(H1, H2) and D(Ajj) (j = 1, 2) be
dense in Hj. Then (B.5) holds.
Proof. (i) By Lemma B.1, we need only to show that D(A∗) ⊂D(B),
where B is deﬁned by (B.4).
Note that, in the present case, D(A) =
D(A21)⊕D(A12) and D(B) = D(A∗
12)⊕D(A∗
21). Let ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) ∈D(A∗).
Then, for all φ = (φ1, φ2) ∈D(A),
⟨A∗ψ, φ⟩= ⟨ψ, Aφ⟩.
(B.6)
Let φ2 = 0. Then (B.6) implies that
⟨(A∗ψ)1 −A∗
11ψ1, φ1⟩= ⟨ψ2, A21φ1⟩.
Hence ψ2 ∈D(A∗
21) and A∗
21ψ2 = (A∗ψ)1 −A∗
11ψ1. Next, taking φ1 = 0
in (B.6) and calculating similarly, we see that ψ1 ∈D(A∗
12) and A∗
12ψ1 =
(A∗ψ)2 −A∗
22ψ2. Hence ψ ∈D(B). Thus D(A∗) ⊂D(B).
(ii) Similar to the proof of (i).
Proposition B.1. Let A1 and A2 be densely deﬁned linear operators on
H1 and H2 respectively. Then
A :=
A1 0

is self-adjoint if and only if A1 and A2 are self-adjoint.
 

Operators on a Direct Sum Hilbert Space

Proof. By Theorem B.1(ii),
A∗=

.
Hence the self-adjointness A = A∗is equivalent to that A1 = A∗
1 and
A2 = A∗
2.
Theorem B.2. Let A be a densely deﬁned closed operator from H1 to H2
and
QA :=
 0 A∗
A 0

.
(B.7)
Then QA is self-adjoint and
Q2
A =

(B.8)
Proof. Applying Theorem B.1(i) to the case where A11 = 0, A22 =
0, A21 = A and A12 = A∗(note that D(A∗) is dense, because A is
densely deﬁned and closed) and using the fact that (A∗)∗= A, we see
that Q∗
A = QA. Hence QA is self-adjoint.
To prove (B.8), we ﬁrst note that (ψ1, ψ2) ∈D(Q2
A) is equivalent to
that ψ1 ∈D(A∗A) and ψ2 ∈D(AA∗). A simple calculation shows that
Q2
A(ψ1, ψ2) = (A∗Aψ1, AA∗ψ2), ψ1 ∈D(A∗A), ψ2 ∈D(AA∗). Hence (B.8)
holds.
As a corollary to Theorem B.2, one ﬁnds an easy and clear-cut proof
of the celebrated von Neumann theorem (e.g., [Reed and Simon (1975),
Theorem X.25]) on the self-adjointness of A∗A with A being a densely
deﬁned closed operator from a Hilbert space to a Hilbert space9:
Corollary B.1 (von Neumann theorem). Let A be a densely deﬁned
closed operator from H1 to H2. Then A∗A is a non-negative self-adjoint
operator on H1.
Proof. The self-adjointness of QA in Theorem B.2 implies that of Q2
A.
Hence, by (B.8) and Proposition B.1, A∗A and AA∗are self-adjoint. It is
easy to show that A∗A is non-negative.
9The novel idea is due to Edward Nelson [Thaller (1992), p.143].

Appendix C
Absolutely Continuous Spectrum and
Singular Continuous Spectrum of a
Self-adjoint Operator
In this appendix, we review a classiﬁcation of the spectrum of a self-adjoint
operator.
Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a complex Hilbert space H and EA
be its spectral measure. For any vector Ψ ∈H , the mapping µΨ : B1 →
[0, ∞) deﬁned by
µΨ(B) := ∥EA(B)Ψ∥2,
B ∈B1
is a bounded measure on (R, B1).
A vector Ψ ∈H is said to be absolutely continuous with respect to
A if the measure µΨ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue
measure µL on R.
If µΨ is singular with respect to µL, then Ψ is said to be singular with
respect to A.
We denote by Hac(A) (resp. Hs(A)) the set of vectors absolutely con-
tinuous (resp. singular) with respect to A. It is easy to see that Hac(A)
and Hs(A) are subspaces of H . The subspace Hac(A) (resp. Hs(A)) is
called the absolutely continuous (resp. singular) subspace of A.
Theorem C.1.
(i) The subspaces Hac(A) and Hs(A) are mutually orthogonal closed sub-
spaces and
H = Hac(A) ⊕Hs(A).
(ii) The operator A is reduced by Hac(A) and Hs(A).
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that Hac(A) ⊥Hs(A) · · · (∗).
Let Ψ ∈Hac(A), Φ ∈Hs(A). By the deﬁnition of a singular vector,
there exists a Borel set S0 such that µL(S0) = 0 and ∥EA(R \ S0)Φ∥= 0.
803
 

804
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence EA(S0)Φ = Φ. Therefore
⟨Ψ, Φ⟩= ⟨Ψ, EA(S0)Φ⟩= ⟨EA(S0)Ψ, Φ⟩.
Since Ψ is absolutely continuous with respect to A, ∥EA(S0)Ψ∥= 0, i.e.,
EA(S0)Ψ = 0. Hence ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩= 0. Thus (∗) holds.
We next show that H = Hac(A) + Hs(A) · · · (∗∗).10
Let Ξ ∈H . Then, by Lebesgue’s decomposition theorem, the measure
µΞ is decomposed as µΞ = m1 + m2, where m1 (resp. m2) is a measure
absolutely continuous (resp. singular) with respect to µL. There exists a
Borel set B0 such that µL(B0) = 0 and m2(B) = m2(B ∩B0), B ∈B1.
Put Φ := EA(B0)Ξ, Ψ := Ξ −Φ. Then
µΦ(B) = ∥EA(B)EA(B0)Ξ∥2 = ∥EA(B ∩B0)Ξ∥2
= µΞ(B ∩B0) = m2(B ∩B0) = m2(B),
where we have used m1(B ∩B0) = 0. Hence Φ ∈Hs(A). We also have
µΨ(B) = ∥EA(B)(1 −EA(B0))Ξ∥2 = ∥EA(B)Ξ∥2 −∥EA(B ∩B0)Ξ∥2
= µΞ(B) −m2(B) = m1(B).
Hence Ψ ∈Hac(A). Therefore Ξ = Ψ + Φ ∈Hac(A) + Hs(A). Thus (∗∗)
holds.
Now one can easily show that (∗) and (∗∗) imply the desired result.
(ii) Let P be the orthogonal projection onto Hac(H ).
For all Ψ ∈
Hac(A) and B ∈B1, EA(B)Ψ ∈Hac(A). Indeed, if µL(S) = 0 (S ∈B1),
then EA(S)Ψ = 0 and hence EA(S)EA(B)Ψ = EA(B)EA(S)Ψ = 0. Hence
EA(B)Hac(A) ⊂Hac(A). This fact and (i) imply that EA(B)Hs(A) ⊂
Hs(A). Hence it follows that, for all B ∈B1, EA(B)P = PEA(B). By this
result and the operational calculus, we see that PA ⊂AP. Hence Hac(A)
reduces A. By part (i), this implies the reducibility of A by Hs(A).
We recall that σp(A) denotes the point spectrum of A (see Subsection
1.1.2). We deﬁne
Hp(A) := Ran(EA(σp(A))).
(C.1)
This closed subspace is equal to the closure of the subspace spanned by all
eigenvectors of A if σp(A) ̸= ∅.
Lemma C.1. Hp(A) ⊂Hs(A).
10For subspaces V1 and V2 of a vector space, V1 + V2 := {v1 + v2|v1 ∈V1, v2 ∈V2}.
 

Absolutely and Singular Continuous Spectrums of a Self-adjoint Operator
805
Proof. Let AΨ = λΨ with λ ∈σp(A) and S0 := {λ}. Then µL(S0) = 0
and ∥EA(R \ S0)Ψ∥= 0. Hence Ψ ∈Hs(A). Since Hs(A) is closed, the
desired result follows.
By Lemma C.1, one can deﬁne
Hsc(A) := Hp(A)⊥∩Hs(A) ⊂Hs(A).
This closed subspace is called the singular continuous subspace of A.
By Theorem C.1, H has the orthogonal decomposition
H = Hac(A) ⊕Hsc(A) ⊕Hp(A)
and each closed subspace H#(A) (# =ac, s, p) reduces A. We denote by
A# the reduced part of A to H#(A). Hence A is written as the direct sum
of them:
A = Aac ⊕Asc ⊕Ap.
The operator Aac (resp. Asc, Ap) is called the absolutely continuous
part (resp.
singular continuous part, point-spectral part) of A.
Thus, introducing
σac(A) := σ(Aac),
σsc(A) := σ(Asc),
σpp(A) := σ(Ap),
we have
σ(A) = σac(A) ∪σsc(A) ∪σpp(A).
(C.2)
The set σac(A) (resp. σsc(A), σpp(A)) is called the absolutely contin-
uous spectrum (resp.
singular continuous spectrum, pure point
spectrum) of A.
By (1.4), Theorem 1.11(ii) and (C.2), we have
σc(A) = σac(A) ∪σsc(A).
(C.3)
We remark also that
σpp(A) = σp(A).
If H = Hac(A), then A is said to be absolutely continuous or to
have purely absolutely continuous spectrum.
If H = Hsc(A), then A is said to be singular continuous or to have
purely singular continuous spectrum.
If H = Hp(A), then A is said to be purely point spectral.
The following fact should be kept in mind:
Theorem C.2. Suppose that A is absolutely continuous.
Then, for all
Ψ, Φ ∈H ,
lim
t→±∞

Φ, eitAΨ

= 0.
(C.4)
 

806
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. By the polarization identity, it is suﬃcient to prove (C.4) in the
case where Φ = Ψ. By the functional calculus, we have

Ψ, eitAΨ

=
Z
R
eitλd∥EA(λ)Ψ∥2.
By the absolute continuity of A, there exists a non-negative function f ∈
L1(R) such that
∥EA(B)Ψ∥2 =
Z
B
f(λ)dλ,
B ∈B1.
Hence

Ψ, eitAΨ

=
Z
R
eitλf(λ)dλ.
Then, by the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, the right hand side converges to
0 as t →±∞.
The absolute continuity of a self-adjoint operator is a unitary invariant
property:
Proposition C.1. Let A be an absolutely continuous self-adjoint operator
on H . Then, for any unitary operator U : H →K (a Hilbert space), the
self-adjoint operator UAU −1 on K is absolutely continuous.
Proof. The spectral measure EUAU−1 of UAU −1 is given by EUAU−1(B) =
UEA(B)U −1, B ∈B1. Hence, if the Lebesgue measure of B ∈B1 is zero,
then ∥EUAU−1(B)Φ∥= 0 for all Φ ∈K .
For B ∈B1, |B| denotes the Lebesgue measure of B.
Proposition C.2. Suppose that A is absolutely continuous. Then, for any
real-valued continuous function f on R such that |f −1(B)| = 0 if |B| = 0
(B ∈B1), f(A) is self-adjoint and absolutely continuous.
Proof. The self-adjointness follows from functional calculus.
By Theo-
rem 1.19, the spectral measure Ef(A) of f(A) is given by Ef(A)(B) =
EA(f −1(B)), B ∈B1. Hence, for all ψ ∈H ,
∥Ef(A)(B)ψ∥2 = ∥EA(f −1(B))ψ∥2.
By the present assumption, if |B| = 0, then |f −1(B)| = 0 and hence
∥EA(f −1(B))ψ∥2 = 0, implying ∥Ef(A)(B)ψ∥2 = 0. Thus f(A) is abso-
lutely continuous.
 

Absolutely and Singular Continuous Spectrums of a Self-adjoint Operator
807
The following proposition gives a suﬃcient condition for a multiplication
operator on L2(Rd
k) to be absolutely continuous.
Proposition C.3. Let F be a real-valued continuous function on Rd such
that, for all f ∈L2(Rd
k),
R
F −1(B) |f(k)|2dk = 0 if |B| = 0 (B ∈B1). Then
the multiplication operator MF by F on L2(Rd
k) (which is self-adjoint) is
absolutely continuous.
Proof. The spectral measure of MF is given by E(B) = χF −1(B), B ∈B1.
Hence, for all f ∈L2(Rd
k),
∥E(B)f∥2 =
Z
F −1(B)
|f(k)|2dk.
If |B| = 0, then the right hand side vanishes by the assumption and hence
∥E(B)f∥2 = 0. Thus MF is absolutely continuous.
Example C.1. Let m > 0 and consider the function F given by F(k) =
k2
2m, k ∈Rd.
Then, using the polar coordinate in Rd, we have for all
f ∈L2(Rd
k) and B ∈B1
Z
F −1(B)
|f(k)|2dk =
Z
k2
2m ∈B
|f(k)|2dk

Z
Sd−1 dS(ω)
Z
k2
2m ∈B∩[0,∞)
|f(kω)|2kd−1dk,
where Sd−1 := {ω ∈Rd| |ω| = 1} and dS(ω) is the standard measure on
Sd−1. By change of variable, we have
Z
k2
2m ∈B∩[0,∞)
|f(kω)|2kd−1dk
= (2m)(d−1)/2
rm
2
Z
r∈B∩[0,∞)
|f(

2mrω)|2r(d−2)/2dr.
Hence,
if |B|
=
0,
then the right hand side vanishes,
implying
R
F −1(B) |f(k)|2dk = 0. Thus, by Proposition C.3, the multiplication op-
erator
k2
2m on L2(Rd
k) is absolutely continuous. Since F −1
d
k2
2mFd = −∆
2m,
where Fd is the d-dimensional Fourier transform and ∆is the generalized
Laplacian on L2(Rd
x), it follows from Proposition C.1 that −∆
2m is abso-
lutely continuous.
Example C.2. Let m ≥0. Then the multiplication operator
p
|k|2 + m2
on L2(Rd
k) is absolutely continuous (consider the case where F(k) =

Hence
√
−∆+ m2 = F −1
d
p
|k|2 + m2Fd is abso-

−∆+ m2 can be proved
also by applying Proposition C.2 to the case where A = −∆and f(λ) =

∂j :=
∂
∂xj
.
We denote by C∞(Rd) the set of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions on
Rd (C∞-functions) and introduce
C∞
0 (Rd) := {f ∈C∞(Rd)|supp f is compact},
where supp f denotes the support of f.
We denote by Z+ the set of non-negative integers: Z+ := {0} ∪N. An
element of the d direct product
Zd
+ := {α = (α1, . . . , αd)|αj ∈Z+, j = 1, . . . , d}
of Z+ is called a multi-index. The norm of α ∈Z+ is deﬁned by
|α| :=
d
X
j=1
αj.

For each α ∈Z+, we introduce a partial diﬀerential operator ∂α as follows:
∂α := ∂α1
1 · · · ∂αd
d .
It is easy to see that C∞
0 (Rd) is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex vector
space with the usual operation of addition for two functions and the usual
scalar multiplication for a function.
For each f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), we deﬁne ∥f∥0,k (k ∈Z+) by
∥f∥0,k :=
sup
x∈Rd,α∈Zd
+,|α|≤k
|∂αf(x)|.
The mapping ∥· ∥0,k : C∞
0 (Rd) →R is a norm of C∞
0 (Rd).
A sequence {fn}∞
n=1 in C∞
0 (Rd) is said to converge to f ∈C∞
0 (Rd) if
there exists a compact set K ⊂Rd such that, for all n ∈N, supp fn ⊂K
and, for all k ∈Z+, limn→∞∥fn −f∥0,k = 0.
We denote by D(Rd) the space C∞
0 (Rd) with this concept of convergence
on sequences12 and the above convergence is written fn
D→f (n →∞).
In general, a linear operator from a complex vector space V to C is
called a linear functional on V . The set of linear functionals on V is
a complex vector space with the usual operation of addition for two linear
operators and the usual scalar multiplication for a linear operator.
A linear functional φ on D(Rd) (φ : D(Rd) ∋f 7→φ(f) ∈C) is said to
be continuous if fn, f ∈D(Rd), fn
D→f (n →∞), then limn→∞φ(fn) =
φ(f).
A continuous linear functional on D(Rd) is called a distribution on
Rd. We denote by D′(Rd) the set of distributions on Rd.
A function in D(Rd) is called a test function in relation to D′(Rd).
The concept of support of a usual function is extended to the case of
distributions as follows.
Let D be an open set of Rd. A distribution φ ∈D′(Rd) is said to vanish
in D if φ(f) = 0 for all f ∈D(Rd) with supp f ⊂D. The support of φ,
denoted by supp φ, is deﬁned to be the complement of the largest open set
on which φ vanishes.
Example D.1. A Lebesgue measurable function g on Rd is said to be
locally integrable if, for all R > 0,
R
|x|≤R |g(x)|dx < ∞. We denote by
L1
loc(Rd) the set of locally integrable functions on Rd. The equality g = h
for g, h ∈L1
loc(Rd) is deﬁned by g(x) = h(x) a.e.
(almost everywhere)
x ∈Rd.
12More precisely speaking, D(Rd) is the topological space (C∞
0 (Rd), {∥· ∥0,k}∞
k=0)
equipped with the natural topology determined by the system {∥· ∥0,k}∞
k=0 of norms.
 

Elements of the Theory of Distributions
811
Let g ∈L1
loc(Rd) be ﬁxed. Then, for all f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), gf is integrable
with R
Rd |g(x)f(x)|dx ≤Cf∥f∥0,0 with Cf := R
supp f |g(x)|dx. Hence
φg(f) :=
Z
Rd g(x)f(x)dx
is deﬁned and |φg(f)| ≤Cf∥f∥0,0. It follows that the mapping φg : f 7→
φg(f) is linear and continuous in D(Rd). Hence φg ∈D′(Rd).
Let φg = φh with g, h ∈L1
loc(Rd).
Then
R
Rd(g(x) −h(x))f(x)dx =
0, ∀f ∈D(Rd). Hence, by the fundamental lemma of the calculus of varia-
tions or du Bois-Reymond’s lemma13, g(x) −h(x) = 0 a.e. x ∈Rd. Hence
g = h. Therefore the correspondence: g 7→φg is one-to-one. In this sense,
we write
L1
loc(Rd) ⊂D′(Rd)
and each function g ∈L1
loc(Rd) can be regarded as a distribution.
It is obvious that, if supp f ⊂(supp g)c, then φg(f) = 0.
Hence
(supp g)c ⊂(supp φg)c. By using du Bois-Reymond’s lemma, one can show
that (supp φg)c ⊂(supp g)c. Hence it follows that supp g = supp φg. Thus,
as far as locally integrable functions are concerned, the deﬁnition of the
support of a distribution can be regarded as a natural extension of the
concept of support of usual functions.
Example D.2. Let a ∈Rd and δa : D(Rd) →C be deﬁned by
δa(f) := f(a),
f ∈D(Rd).
The mapping δa is linear and
|δa(f)| ≤∥f∥0,0.
(D.1)
Hence δa is a continuous linear functional on D(Rd), i.e., δa ∈D′(Rd). The
distribution δa is called Dirac’s delta distribution or delta distribu-
tion at a.
We set δ := δ0
It is easy to see that supp δa = {a}.
In the physics literature, one uses a symbol δa(x) in such a way that
δa(f) =
Z
Rd δa(x)f(x)dx
and calls δa(x) “Dirac’s delta function”.
But, as von Neumann already
pointed out [von Neumann (1932), Chapter I], such a function does not
13See, e.g., [Kuroda (1980), Theorem 6.5].
 

812
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
exists. To prove this, suppose that there existed such a function δa(x). Then
R
Rd δa(x)f(x)dx = f(a). Hence, for all f ∈C∞
0 (Rd) such that supp f ⊂
Rd \ {a},
R
Rd δa(x)f(x)dx = 0.
Hence, by du Bois-Reymond’s lemma,
δa(x) = 0 a.e. x ∈Rd. Therefore, for all f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), f(a) = 0. But this
is a contradiction. Thus δa is a distribution which can not be regarded as
a function.
Although δa(x) is not a function as we have seen above, it can be used as
a mere symbol. In that case, there would be no problem unless meaningless
operations such as δa(x)n (n = 1, 2, . . .) are made. The following symbol
also is used:
δa(x) = δ(x −a).
The “visual” notation used for Dirac’s delta distribution can be ex-
tended to other distributions. Namely, for a distribution φ ∈D′(Rd) and
f ∈D(Rd), the following notation with a symbol φ(x) is sometimes used:
Z
Rd φ(x)f(x)dx := φ(f).
The symbol φ(x) is called the distribution kernel of φ. But one should
keep in mind that, in general, φ(x) is just a symbol which has no math-
ematical meaning unless it is a locally integrable function. The left hand
side of the above equation is just a symbolical expression which has a math-
ematical meaning as an integral only if φ(x) is locally integrable.
We sometimes use the phrase “φ(x) is a distribution on Rd” to mean
that it is the distribution kernel of a distribution φ ∈D′(Rd).
For two distributions φ and ψ, the equality φ = ψ in D′(Rd), i.e.,
φ(f) = ψ(f) for all f ∈D(Rd), is sometimes stated as “φ(x) = ψ(x) in the
sense of distribution” or simply “φ(x) = ψ(x)”.
Example D.3. For each a > 0, there exists a mapping φa : D(R) →C
deﬁned by
φa(f) := 1
2a(f(a) + f(−a)),
f ∈D(R).
It follows that
φa = 1
2a(δa + δ−a)
(D.2)
and hence φa ∈D′(R). We have supp φa = {−a, a}.
 

Elements of the Theory of Distributions
813
Usually the distribution kernel of φa is denoted δ(x2 −a2): φa(f) =
R
R δ(x2 −a2)f(x)dx.14 Then, by (D.2), we have
δ(x2 −a2) = 1
2a(δ(x −a) + δ(x + a)).
D.1.2
Multiplication by C∞-functions
Let u ∈C∞(Rd). Then, for all f ∈D(Rd), uf ∈D(Rd). Hence, for each
φ ∈D′(Rd), one can deﬁne uφ : D(Rd) →C by
(uφ)(f) := φ(uf),
f ∈D(Rd).
It is easy to see that uφ ∈D′(Rd).
The distribution uφ is called the
product of u and φ.
D.1.3
Complex conjugation, reality and positivity
For all φ ∈D′(Rd), we deﬁne φ∗: D(Rd) →C by
φ∗(f) := φ(f ∗)∗.
It is easy to see that φ∗∈D′(Rd). The distribution φ∗is called the com-
plex conjugation of φ. We denote the distribution kernel of φ∗by φ(x)∗.
If φ∗= φ, then φ is said to be real.
We denote by DR(Rd) the set of real-valued test functions on Rd:
DR(Rd) := {f ∈D(Rd)|f ∗= f}.
It is easy to show that φ ∈D′(Rd) is real if and only if, for all f ∈
DR(Rd), φ(f) is a real number.
The φg in Example D.1 is real if g is real. The delta distribution δa
(Example D.2) is real.
A distribution φ ∈D′(Rd) is said to be positive if, for all non-negative
functions f ∈D(Rd), φ(f) ≥0. In this case, we write φ ≥0.
The delta distribution δa on Rd (a ∈Rd) is positive.
14This comes from the following heuristic computations:

Partial derivatives of distributions
For each multi-index α and φ ∈D′(Rd), a linear functional Dαφ on D(Rd)
is deﬁned by
(Dαφ)(f) := (−1)|α|φ(∂αf),
f ∈D(Rd).
It is easy to see that, fn, f ∈D(Rd), fn
D
−→f (n →∞), then ∂αfn
D
−→∂αf
(n →∞). Hence Dαφ is continuous on D(Rd), i.e., Dαφ ∈D′(Rd). We
call Dαφ a partial derivative of φ with order |α|.
The mapping Dα : φ 7→Dαφ (φ ∈D′(Rd)) is a linear operator from
D′(Rd) to itself. We call Dα a generalized partial diﬀerential operator
of order |α|.
If α = (0, . . . , 0, αj, 0, . . . , 0) (the components other than the jth one
are zero), then we write
Dα = Dαj
j .
It follows that, for all multi-indices α ∈Zd
+,
Dαφ = Dα1
1 · · · Dαd
d φ,
φ ∈D′(Rd),
where the order of the generalized partial diﬀerential operators appearing
on the right hand side is arbitrary.
As is easily seen, if φ ∈D′(Rd) is a diﬀerentiable function, then each
partial derivative of φ coincides with the corresponding partial derivative
of φ in the classical sense.
In the case d = 1, for each n ∈N, we denote by Dn the generalized
diﬀerential operator of order n on D′(R):
(Dnφ)(f) = (−1)nφ(f (n)),
f ∈D(R), φ ∈D′(R),
where f (n) denotes the derivative of f of order n. We set D := D1.
Example D.4. The Heaviside function θ : R →R is deﬁned by
θ(x) :=
 1 for x ≥0
0 for x < 0 .
It is easy to see that θ ∈D′(R) and, for all f ∈D(R),
Dθ(f) = −θ(f ′) = −
Z ∞
0
f ′(x)dx = f(0) = δ(f).
Hence Dθ = δ, i.e.,
Dθ(x) = δ(x)
in the sense of distribution.

Tempered Distributions
A complex-valued function f on Rd is said to be rapidly decreasing if
f ∈C∞(Rd) and, for all m ∈Z+ and multi-indices α ∈Zd
+,
lim
|x|→∞|x|m∂αf(x) = 0.
We denote by S (Rd) the set of rapidly decreasing functions on Rd. The
set S (Rd) is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex vector space with the usual
operation of addition for two functions and the usual scalar multiplication
for a function. It is obvious that
C∞
0 (Rd) ⊂S (Rd).
Example D.5. For each n ∈N, the function f deﬁned by f(x) := e−|x|2n
is in S (Rd), but f ̸∈C∞
0 (Rd).
Let f ∈S (Rd). Then it is easy to see that, for all m ∈Z+ and any
multi-index α ∈Zd
+,
∥f∥m,α := sup
x∈Rd(1 + |x|)m |∂αf(x)|
(D.3)
is ﬁnite and ∥· ∥m,α is a norm of S (Rd). Hence (S (Rd), ∥· ∥m,α) is a
normed space.
A sequence {fn}n in S (Rd) (fn ∈S (Rd), n ∈N) is said to converge
to a function f ∈S (Rd) if, for all m ∈Z+ and multi-indices α ∈Zd
+,
lim
n→∞∥fn −f∥m,α = 0.
The convergence in this sense is written
fn
S
−→f (n →∞).
The space S (Rd) is sometimes called the Schwartz space of rapidly
decreasing functions.
A linear functional φ on S (Rd) is said to be continuous if fn, f ∈
S (Rd), fn
S→f (n →∞), then limn→∞φ(fn) = φ(f).
A continuous linear functional on S (Rd) is called a tempered distri-
bution on Rd. We denote by S ′(Rd) the set of tempered distributions on
Rd. An element f in S (Rd) is called a test function for S ′(Rd).
It follows that
S ′(Rd) ⊂D′(Rd),
(D.4)
i.e., any tempered distribution on Rd is a distribution on Rd.
 

816
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
As in the case of distributions, we mean by the phrase “φ(x) is a tem-
pered distribution on Rd” that it is the distribution kernel of a tempered
distribution φ ∈S ′(Rd).
The space S ′(Rd) is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex vector space.
Some typical examples of tempered distributions are discussed in the
next section.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a linear functional on S (Rd) to
be a tempered distribution on Rd is given by the following theorem:
Theorem D.1. Let φ be a linear functional on S (Rd).
Then φ is in
S ′(Rd) if and only if there exist an n ∈N, mj ∈Z+, α(j) ∈Zd
+ (j =
1, . . . , n) and a constant C > 0 such that
|φ(f)| ≤C
n
X
j=1
∥f∥mj,α(j),
f ∈S (Rd).
(D.5)
Proof. It is easy to see that (D.5) implies the continuity of φ. The converse
statement can be proved by a method similar to one used in proving the
fact that a continuous linear operator from a normed space to a normed
space is bounded.
Since (D.4) holds, for each α ∈Zd
+ and φ ∈S ′(Rd), the partial deriva-
tive Dαφ exists as an element of D′(Rd) a priori. But the following theorem
holds:
Theorem D.2. For all φ ∈S ′(Rd) and α ∈Zd
+, Dαφ ∈S ′(Rd).

Examples of Tempered Distributions

Lp-functions
Let 1 ≤p < ∞, d ∈N and Lp(Rd) be the set of Borel measurable functions
f on Rd such that
R
Rd |f(x)|pdx < ∞. For each f ∈Lp(Rd), one can deﬁne
a non-negative number ∥f∥Lp(Rd) by
∥f∥Lp(Rd) :=
Z
Rd |f(x)|pdx
1/p
.
We denote by L∞(Rd) the set of Borel measurable functions f on Rd
such that the essential supremum
∥f∥L∞(Rd) := ess.supx∈Rd|f(x)|
 

Elements of the Theory of Distributions
817
of f is ﬁnite. It is obvious that
S (Rd) ⊂L∞(Rd).
As for Lp(Rd) with 1 ≤p < ∞, we have the following lemma:
Lemma D.1. Let 1 ≤p < ∞. Then S (Rd) ⊂Lp(Rd) and, for all m ∈N
with m > d/p,
∥f∥Lp(Rd) ≤cm,p∥f∥m,0,
f ∈S (Rd),
where
cm,p :=
Z
Rd(1 + |x|)−mpdx
1/p
.
Proof. Let f ∈S (Rd) and 1 ≤p < ∞. Then
Z
Rd |f(x)|pdx =
Z
Rd(1 + |x|)−mp ( (1 + |x|)m|f(x)| )p dx
≤∥f∥p
m,0
Z
Rd(1 + |x|)−mpdx = cp
m,p∥f∥p
m,0 < ∞.
Hence the desired result follows.
Let g ∈Lp(Rd) (1 ≤p < ∞) and q > 1 be deﬁned by
1
p + 1
q = 1.
Let f ∈S (Rd). Then, by H¨older’s inequality,
Z
Rd |g(x)f(x)|dx ≤∥g∥Lp(Rd)∥f∥Lq(Rd) ≤∥g∥Lp(Rd)cm,q∥f∥m,0 < ∞,
where, in the last inequality, we have used Lemma D.1. Hence, by Theorem
D.1, the functional φg : S (Rd) →C deﬁned by
φg(f) :=
Z
Rd g(x)f(x)dx,
f ∈S (Rd)
(D.6)
is a tempered distribution on Rd (the linearity φg(f) in f is easily seen).
In the case where g ∈L∞(Rd), we have
Z
Rd |g(x)f(x)|dx ≤∥g∥L∞(Rd)cm,1∥f∥m,0,
m > d.
Hence, in this case too, φg is a tempered distribution on Rd.
By using H¨older’s inequality, one can easily show that
Lp(Rd) ⊂L1
loc(Rd),
1 ≤p ≤∞.
In the same way as in the case of φg with g ∈L1
loc(Rd), one can show
that the correspondence : Lp(Rd) ∋g 7→φg ∈S ′(Rd) (1 ≤p ≤∞) is
one-to-one. In this sense we have
Lp(Rd) ⊂S ′(Rd),
1 ≤p ≤∞.
We remark that there are locally integrable functions which are not
tempered distributions.
For example, the function g deﬁned by g(x) =
ex2, x ∈Rd is locally integrable, but φg ̸∈S ′(Rd).

Polynomially bounded functions
A function g : Rd →C is said to be polynomially bounded if it is Borel
measurable and, for some p ∈N and a constant C > 0,
|g(x)| ≤C(1 + |x|)p,
x ∈Rd.
(D.7)
Let g : Rd →C be polynomially bounded satisfying (D.7). Then, for all
f ∈S (Rd) and m > d,
Z
Rd |g(x)| |f(x)|dx ≤
Z
Rd C(1 + |x|)−m(1 + |x|)p+m|f(x)|dx
≤Ccm,1∥f∥p+m,0 < ∞.
Hence, by Theorem D.1, φg : S (Rd) →C deﬁned by (D.6) is a tempered
distribution on Rd.
D.3.3
Delta distributions
(1) For all f ∈S (Rd) too, (D.1) holds. Hence, for all a ∈Rd, δa ∈S ′(Rd).
(2) We deﬁne a mapping φ0 : S (R2d) →C by
φ0(f) :=
Z
Rd f(x, x)dx,
f ∈S (R2d).
Let m > d. Then
|f(x, x)| =
1
(1 +
p
|x|2 + |x|2)m (1 +
p
|x|2 + |x|2)m|f(x, x)|
≤
∥f∥m,0
(1 +
√
2|x|)m
Hence |φ0(f)| ≤cm,1∥f∥m,0. Hence, by Theorem D.1, φ0 ∈S ′(R2d).
The distribution kernel of φ0 is denoted δ(x −y):
Z
R2d δ(x −y)f(x, y)dx dy := φ0(f) =
Z
Rd f(x, x)dx.
We call φ0 the diagonal delta distribution on R2d.
(3) We next consider a generalization of φ0. For each p = 1, . . . , n and
f ∈S (Rd(n+p)), we deﬁne a function f (p) on Rdn by
f (p)(x1, . . . , xn) := f(x1, . . . , xn, xi1, . . . , xip), xj ∈Rd, j = 1, . . . , n,
where {xi1, . . . , xip} ⊂{x1, . . . , xn} such that i1 < i2 < · · · < ip. It
is easy to see that f (p) ∈S (Rdn).
Hence, for all F ∈S ′(Rdn), a
mapping φ(p)
F
: S (Rd(n+p)) →C is deﬁned by
φ(p)
F (f) := F(f (p)),
f ∈S (Rd(n+p)).

One can show that, if fk, f ∈S (Rd(n+p)), fk
S→f (k →∞), then
f (p)
k
S→f (p) (k →∞). Hence φ(p)
F (fk) →φ(p)
F (f) (k →∞). Therefore
φ(p)
F
∈S ′(Rd(n+p)). We denote the distribution kernel of φ(p)
F
by
F(x1, . . . , xn)δ(xn+1 −xi1) · · · δ(xn+p −xip),
where F(x1, . . . , xn) is the distribution kernel of F. Hence, as sym-
bolical expressions, we have
φ(p)
F (f) =
Z
Rd(n+p) F(x1, . . . , xn)δ(xn+1 −xi1) · · · δ(xn+p −xip)

that, for some n ≥1,
Id(g) :=
Z ∞

|g(r)|
(1 + r)n rd−1dr < ∞.
Let ρ : [0, ∞) →R and f ∈S (R × Rd). Using the polar coordinate in

We have
|f(ρ(r), rω)| = (1 +

Hence, putting C :=

|ω|=1 1 dS(ω), we have
Z
Rd |g(|x|)f(ρ(|x|), x)|dx ≤C∥f∥n,0Id(g) < ∞.
Therefore the mapping Dg,ρ : S (R1+d) →C deﬁned by
Dg,ρ(f) :=
Z
Rd g(|x|)f(ρ(|x|), x)dx,
f ∈S (R1+d)
is a tempered distribution on R1+d. The distribution kernel of Dg,ρ is
written as g(|x|)δ(t −ρ(|x|)) (= g(|x|)δ(ρ(|x|) −t)). The distribution
kernel of Dg,−ρ is written g(|x|)δ(t + ρ(|x|)).

For each φ ∈S ′(Rd), we deﬁne uφ : S (Rd) →C by
(uφ)(f) := φ(uf),
f ∈S (Rd).
Obviously (uφ)(f) is linear in f. If fn, f ∈S (Rd), fn
S→f (n →∞),
then, by (D.8), ufn
S→uf (n →∞) and hence φ(ufn) →φ(uf) (n →∞),
i.e., (uφ)(fn) →(uφ)(f) (n →∞). Therefore uφ ∈S ′(Rd). We call the
tempered distribution uφ the product of u and φ.

Transformations
Let T : Rd →Rd be an injective linear mapping and a ∈Rd. Then T is
bijective, since Rd is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. For each function f
on Rd, one can deﬁne a function f(a,T ) on Rd by
f(a,T )(x) := f(T −1(x −a)),
x ∈Rd.
(D.9)
It is easy to see that, if f ∈S (Rd), then f(a,T ) ∈S (Rd). Hence one
can deﬁne a mapping φ(a,T ) : S (Rd) →C by
φ(a,T )(f) := φ(f(a,T )),
f ∈S (Rd).
It follows that φ(a,T ) ∈S ′(Rd).
Symbolically we have φ(f(a,T )) =
R
Rd φ(x)f(T −1(x −a))dx.
Hence,
heuristically, the change of variable T −1(x −a) →x gives
φ(f(a,T )) =
Z
Rd φ(T x + a)f(x)| det T |dx.
Hence the distribution kernel of φ(a,T ) is given by | det T |φ(T x+a) in terms
of the distribution kernel φ(x) of φ:
φ(a,T )(x) = | det T |φ(T x + a).
The tempered distribution φ(a,I) (the case T = I) is called the trans-
lation of φ by the vector a.
If T is a rotation on Rd (i.e., T ∈SO(d)), then φ(0,T ) is called the
rotation of φ with T .
The tempered distribution φ(0,−I) (the case a = 0, T = −I) is called
the space inversion of φ.
Deﬁnition D.1. Let φ ∈S ′(Rd).
(i) The distribution φ is said to be translation invariant if φ(a,I) = φ
for all a ∈Rd.
(ii) The distribution φ is said to be rotation invariant if φ(0,T ) = φ for
all T ∈SO(d).
(iii) Let G be a linear transformation group on Rd. Then φ is said to be
G-invariant if φ(0,T ) = φ for all T ∈G.
Proposition D.1. If φ ∈S ′(Rd) is translation invariant, then φ is a
constant function.
Remark D.1. The operations described in this subsection are deﬁned also
for distributions.

Rd-translation Invariant Tempered Distributions
For each a ∈Rd and a function f on (Rd)n, we deﬁne a function Ud(a)f on
(Rd)n by
(Ud(a)f)(x1, . . . , xn) = f(x1 −a, x2 −a, . . . , xn −a), (x1, . . . , xn) ∈(Rd)n.
We call Ud(a)f the Rd-translation of f with vector a ∈Rd.
Throughout this section, W ((Rd)n) denotes D((Rd)n) or S ((Rd)n).
It is obvious that, if f ∈W ((Rd)n), then Ud(a)f ∈W ((Rd)n). Hence,
for each φ ∈W ′((Rd)n), one can deﬁne a mapping φa : W ((Rd)n) →C by
φa(f) := φ(Ud(a)f),
f ∈W ((Rd)n).
It is easy to see that φa ∈W ′((Rd)n). We call the distribution φa the
Rd-translation of φ.
The distribition kernel of φa is given by φ(x1 +
a, . . . , xn + a):
φa(f) =
Z
(Rd)n φ(x1 + a, . . . , xn + a)f(x1, . . . , xn)dx1 · · · dxn.
A distribution φ ∈W ′((Rd)n) is said to be Rd-translation invariant
if φa = φ for all a ∈Rd (i.e., φa(f) = φ(f) for all f ∈W ((Rd)n) and
a ∈Rd).
In terms of the distribution kernel φ(x1, . . . , xn) of φ, the Rd-translation
invariance of φ is written
φ(x1 + a, x2 + a, . . . , xn + a) = φ(x1, . . . , xn),
a ∈Rd.
(D.10)
Proposition D.2. Let n ≥2 and φ be an Rd-translation invariant function
on (Rd)n. Then there exists a function on ψ on (Rd)n−1 such that, for all
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈(Rd)n,
φ(x1, . . . , xn) = ψ(x2 −x1, x3 −x1, . . . , xn −x1).
(D.11)
Proof. One needs only to taking a = −x1 in (D.10) and deﬁne a function
ψ on (Rd)n−1 by ψ(y1, . . . , yn−1) := φ(0, y1, . . . , yn−1), (y1, . . . , yn−1) ∈
(Rd)n−1.
The above proposition shows that an Rd-translation invariant function
on (Rd)n is a function of (n −1) independent diﬀerence variables. This
structure is extended to the case where φ is an Rd-translation invariant
distribution:
Theorem D.3. Let n ≥2 and φ ∈W ′((Rd)n) be an Rd-translation invari-
ant distribution. Then there exists a distribution ψ ∈W ′((Rd)n−1) such
that
φ(f) = ψ(I(f)),
f ∈W ((Rd)n),

Rd f(x, y1 + x, . . . , yn−1 + x)dx,
(y1, . . . , yn−1) ∈(Rd)n−1.
Remark D.2. In terms of distribution kernels, (D.12) is written as (D.11).
D.6
Convergence in S ′(Rd)
A sequence {φn}∞
n=1 in S ′(Rd) is said to converge to φ ∈S ′(Rd) if, for
all f ∈S (Rd), limn→∞φn(f) →φ(f). We write this as φn
S ′
−→φ (n →∞)
or limn→∞φn = φ in S ′(Rd). In terms of distribution kernels, we write
φn(x)
S ′
→φ(x) (n →∞) or limn→∞φn(x) = φ(x) in S ′(Rd).
Example D.6. For any v ∈L1(Rd) such that
R
Rd v(x)dx = 1, a ∈Rd and
n ∈N, we deﬁne
vn(x) := ndv(n(x −a),
x ∈Rd.
Then
vn(x)

|x| |f(a −x)| ≤|x −a| |f(a −x)| + |a| |f(a −x)| ≤ma∥f∥1,0,
where ma := max{1, |a|}. Hence Cf ≤2ma∥f∥1,0. Therefore
|p.v.(f)| ≤2(∥f ′∥∞+ ma∥f∥1,0).
Thus the mapping:S (R) ∋f 7→p.v.(f) is a tempered distribution on R.
This distribution is called the principal value distribution at a. We
denote its distribution kernel by p.v.1/(x −a).
The following holds:

where x2 = (x0)2 −x2 (the Minkowski metric of x = (x0, x) ∈R1+d). As
in the case of p.v.1/(x −a), one can show that p.v.(m)(·) is a tempered
distribution on R1+d. We denote this distribution by p.v.1/(x2 −m2). In

n=1in S ′(Rd) is said to be Cauchy or
a fundamental sequence if, for all f ∈S (Rd), {φn(f)}∞
n=1 is a Cauchy
sequence in C.
An important property of S ′(Rd) is given by the following theorem:
Theorem D.4. Every Cauchy sequence {φn}∞
n=1 in S ′(Rd) is a convergent
sequence. Namely, there exists a unique element φ ∈S ′(Rd) such that
limn→∞φn = φ in S ′(Rd).
The property stated in this theorem is called the completeness of
S ′(Rd).

The Schwartz Nuclear Theorem
Let n ≥2, dj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , n and F be an n-linear form on the direct
product
S (Rd1) × · · · × S (Rdn)
(see Remark 2.2). Then F is said to be separately continuous if, for
each j = 1, . . . , n and fk ∈S (Rdk), k ̸= j, the mapping:S (Rdj) ∋fj 7→
F(f1, . . . , fj, . . . fn) is continuous in the topology of S (Rdj).
 

Elements of the Theory of Distributions
827
The next theorem is an important theorem which is about an extension
of a separately continuous multi-linear form on S (Rd1) × · · · × S (Rdn) to
a tempered distribution on Rd1+···+dn.
Theorem D.5 (the Schwartz nuclear theorem).
Let n ≥2 and F
be a separately continuous n-linear form on S (Rd1) × · · · × S (Rdn). Then
there exists a unique tempered distribution φ ∈S ′(Rd1+···+dn) such that,
for all fj ∈S (Rdj), j = 1, . . . , n,
φ(f1 × · · · × fn) = F(f1, . . . , fn),
where
(f1 × · · · × fn)(x1, . . . , xn) = f1(x1) · · · fn(xn), xj ∈Rdj, j = 1, . . . , n.
For a proof of this theorem, see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1980), Theorem
V.1].
Corollary D.1. Let φ, ψ
∈
S ′(Rd1+···+dn) such that, for all fj
∈
S (Rdj), j = 1, . . . , n, φ(f1 × · · · × fn) = ψ(f1 × · · · × fn). Then φ = ψ.
Proof. This follows from the uniqueness property in the Schwartz nuclear
theorem.
Example D.10. Let
F(f, g) :=
Z
Rd f(x)g(x)dx,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Then, in terms of the notation in Subsection D.3.1, F(f, g) = φg(f) =
φf(g). Hence it follows that F is a separately continuous bilinear form on
S (Rd)×S (Rd). Therefore, by the Schwartz nuclear theorem, there exists a
unique tempered distribution δdiag on R2d such that δdiag(f×g) = F(f, g) =
R
Rd f(x)g(x)dx, f, g ∈S (Rd). The delta distribution φ0 on R2d discussed
in Subsection D.3.3 satisﬁes φ0(f × g) =
R
Rd f(x)g(x)dx, f, g ∈S (Rd).
Hence δdiag = φ0.

828
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is called the Fourier transform of f, where kx = Pd
j=1 kjxj (the Euclid
inner product of k and x). It is shown that ˆf ∈S (Rd). Hence we deﬁne a
mapping Fd : S (Rd) →S (Rd) by
Fdf := ˆf,
f ∈S (Rd).
The mapping Fd is called the Fourier transform on S (Rd).
Proposition D.3. The Fourier transform Fd on S (Rd) is bijective and,
for all f ∈S (Rd),
f(x) =

(2π)d/2
Z
Rd eikx ˆf(k)dk,
f ∈S (Rd).
(D.16)
Moreover, Fd preserves the inner product ⟨· , ·⟩of L2(Rd):
⟨Fdf, Fdg⟩= ⟨f, g⟩,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Formula (D.16) is called the Fourier inversion formula. This formula
implies that the inverse Fourier transform F −1

is given by
(F −1

g)(x) = ˇg(k) :=

(2π)d/2
Z
Rd eikxg(k)dk,
g ∈S (Rd).
Remark D.4. (i) It follows from Proposition D.3 and the extension theo-
rem of a densely deﬁned bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space that
Fd is uniquely extended to a unitary operator on L2(Rd). This unitary
extension is denoted by the same symbol Fd. For an element f ∈L2(Rd),
we deﬁne ˆf ∈L2(Rd) by ˆf := Fdf, f ∈L2(Rd). But, in this case, (D.15)
does not hold in general. Instead, the following formula holds:

(ii) Since we have
∥Fdf∥L∞(Rd) ≤
1
(2π)d/2 ∥f∥L1(Rd),
f ∈S (Rd)
and S (Rd) is dense in L1(Rd), Fd can be extended uniquely to a bounded
linear operator from L1(Rd) to L∞(Rd). This extension also is denoted by
the same symbol Fd. In this case, one sees that (D.15) continues to hold:
ˆf(k) := (Fdf)(k) =

For each tempered distribution φ ∈S ′(Rd), there is a linear functional
ˆφ on S (Rd) given by
ˆφ(f) := φ( ˆf),
f ∈S (Rd).
By Proposition D.4, ˆφ is a tempered distribution, i.e., ˆφ ∈S ′(Rd). The
tempered distribution ˆφ is called the Fourier transform of φ. Hence a
mapping F ′
d : S ′(Rd) →S ′(Rd) is deﬁned by
F ′φ := ˆφ,
φ ∈S ′(Rd).
This mapping is called the Fourier transform on S ′(Rd).
Remark D.5. If φ ∈L2(Rd) ∪L1(Rd), then ˆφ ∈S ′(Rd) is identiﬁed with
the Fourier transform of φ deﬁned in Remark D.4. Hence the notation is
consistent.
Theorem D.6. The Fourier transform F ′
d on S ′(Rd) is bijective and con-
tinuous.
The inverse mapping (F ′
d)−1 : S ′(Rd) →S ′(Rd) is called the inverse
Fourier transform on S ′(Rd). We have
(F −1

f ∈S (Rd), φ ∈S ′(Rd).

Based on this fact, for each φ ∈S ′(Rd), a mapping φ ∗f : S (Rd) →C is
deﬁned by
(φ ∗f)(g) := φ( ef ∗g),
g ∈S (Rd).
The mapping φ ∗g is continuous and linear, namely, φ ∗f ∈S ′(Rd). We
call the tempered distribution φ ∗f the convolution of φ and f. This is a
natural extension of the concept of convolution for functions in S (Rd).
For a function f ∈S (Rd) and a point y ∈Rd, a function fy on Rd is
deﬁned by
efy(x) := f(y −x),
x ∈Rd.
The following theorem holds16:
Theorem D.7. For each f ∈S (Rd), the mapping: φ 7→φ ∗f (φ ∈
S ′(Rd)) is a continuous linear operator from S ′(Rd) to S ′(Rd). Moreover,
the following hold (φ ∈S ′(Rd) and f, g ∈S (Rd) are arbitrary):
(i) The convolution φ ∗f is polynomially bounded and inﬁnitely diﬀeren-
tiable with
(φ ∗f)(y) = φ( efy),
y ∈Rd
and, for any multi-index α ∈Zd
+,
Dα(φ ∗f) = (Dαφ) ∗f = φ ∗Dαf.
(ii) (φ ∗f) ∗g = φ ∗(f ∗g).
(iii) [
φ ∗f = (2π)d/2 ˆf ˆφ.
Example D.12. Let δ be the d-dimensional delta distribution. Then, for
all y ∈Rd and f ∈S (Rd), (δ ∗f)(y) = δ( efy) = f(y), i.e., δ ∗f = f.
16For a proof, see, e.g., [Reed and Simon (1975), Theorem IX.4].

D.9.3
Applications: Fundamental solutions for partial
diﬀerential operators
Let P(x) be a polynomial of d real variables x = (x1, . . . , xd) and P(D) be
the partial diﬀerential operator obtained by replacing xj in P(x) with Dj:
P(D) := P(D1, . . . , Dd).
A distribution E ∈D′(Rd) satisfying the distributional partial diﬀeren-
tial equation
P(D)E = δ
is called a fundamental solution for P(D), where δ is the d-dimensional
delta distribution. Namely E ∈D′(Rd) is a fundamental solution for P(D)
if, for all f ∈D(Rd),
E(P(−D)f) = f(0),
where P(−D) := P(−D1, . . . , −Dd).
Remark D.6. A fundamental solution for P(D) is not necessarily unique.
For example, if E is a fundamental solution for P(D), then for all u ∈
D′(Rd), satisfying P(D)u = 0, E + u is a fundamental solution for P(D).
See also Example D.13 below.
Proposition D.5. Let E ∈S ′(Rd) be a fundamental solution for P(D).
Then, for all f ∈S (Rd), u = E ∗f is a polynomially bounded C∞function
satisfying
P(D)u = f.
Proof. The ﬁrst half of the assertion is due to Theorem D.7(i). Theorem
D.7(i) implies also that
P(D)u = P(D)(E ∗f) = (P(D)E) ∗f = δ ∗f = f.
Example D.13. By Example D.4, the Heaviside function θ(x) is a funda-
mental solution for the diﬀerential operator D. The function η on R deﬁned
by
η(x) := θ(x) −θ(−x)
2
satisﬁes Dη = δ. Hence η also is a fundamental solution for D.

Integrations of Functions with Values
in a Hilbert Space
E.1
Strong Riemann Integral
Let H be a Hilbert space and d ∈N.
A mapping F : Rd →H (an
H -valued function on Rd) is said to be strongly continuous if, for all
a ∈Rd, limx→a ∥F(x) −F(a)∥H = 0.
Let F : Rd →H be strongly continuous and
K := [a1, b1] × · · · × [ad, bd] ⊂Rd,
where aj, bj ∈R, aj < bj, j = 1, . . . , d. Let ∆K = {xiki|i = 1, . . . , d, ki =
0, . . . , ni} (ni ∈N) be the following partition of K:
a1 = x10 < x11 < · · · < x1n1 = b1,
a2 = x20 < x21 < · · · < x2n2 = b2,
...
...
an = xd0 < xd1 < · · · < xdnd = bd.
We set ∥∆K∥:= max{|xi(ki+1) −xiki|i = 1, . . . , d, ki = 0, . . . , ni −1}. Let
ξiki ∈[xiki, xi(ki+1)] and consider the Riemann sum

(xi(ki+1) −xiki)
!
F(ξ1k1, . . . , ξdkd) ∈H .
Then, as in the case of C-valued continuous functions on Rd, one can show
that S∆K converges in H as ∥∆K∥→0 with ni →∞, i = 1, . . . , d, inde-
pendently of the choice of {ξiki}i,ki. We write
Z
K
F(x)dx :=
lim
∥∆K∥→0 S∆K
and call it the strong Riemann integral of F on K.

exists.
Example E.1. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, for all t ∈R,
eitA is a unitary operator which is strongly continuous in t ∈R. Hence, for
all continuous functions f on R, f(t)eitA is strongly continuous in t ∈R.
Suppose that
R
R |f(t)|dt < ∞. Let ψ ∈H . Then F : R →H deﬁned by

E.2
Bochner Integral
Let (X, Σ, µ) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space and H be a separable Hilbert
space.
We denote by L1(X, dµ; H ) the set of H -valued Σ-measurable
function F on X (see Section 2.7) such that
Z
X
∥F(x)∥dµ(x) < ∞.
Let F ∈L1(X, dµ; H ) and {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H . Then one has the
expansion
F(x) =
∞
X
n=1
⟨en, F(x)⟩en,
x ∈X.
The function : x 7→⟨en, F(x)⟩is Σ-measurable and | ⟨en, F(x)⟩| ≤∥F(x)∥.
Hence
Z
X
| ⟨en, F(x)⟩|dµ(x) ≤
Z
X
∥F(x)∥dµ(x) < ∞.
By this fact, one can deﬁne a sequence {IN(F)}∞
N=1 in H by
IN(F) :=

Z
X
⟨en, F(x)⟩dµ(x)

Lemma E.1. The limit
I(F) := lim

exists independently of the choice of the CONS {en}∞
n=1.

hold:
lim
M,N→∞GN,M(x) = 0,
∥GN,M(x)∥≤∥F(x)∥
(by Bessel’s inequality).
Hence | ⟨F(y), GN,M(x)⟩| ≤∥F(y)∥∥F(x)∥.
The function on the right

by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
lim

dµ(y) ⟨F(y), GN,M(x)⟩= 0.
This means that ∥IM(F) −IN(F)∥2 →0 (M, N →∞). Thus {IN(F)}∞

is a Cauchy sequence.
By the peceding result, the limit I(F) of {IN(F)}N exists. To show

The vector

Appendix F
Representations of Linear Lie Groups
and Lie Algebras
F.1
A Linear Lie Group and Its Lie Algebra
For a natural number n ∈N, we denote by GL(n, C) the set of all complex
n×n invertible (regular) matrices. This set forms a group with the product
operation of matrices. The group GL(n, C) is called the general linear
group of degree n.
A subgroup G of GL(n, C) is called a linear Lie group of degree n if
it is a closed set in GL(n, C) in the standard topology of the matrix space
Mn(C).
Example F.1. The following sets are linear Lie groups of degree n:
(i) GL(n, R) := {A ∈Mn(R)|A is invertible}.
(ii) SL(n, K) := {A ∈Mn(K)| det A = 1} (K = C or R). This group is
called the special linear group of degree n.
(iii) O(n) := {A ∈Mn(R)|tAA = In}, where tA is the transposed
matrix of A and In denotes the n × n identity matrix. This group is
called the orthogonal group of degree n.
(iv) SO(n) := {A ∈O(n)| det A = 1}. This group is called the special
orthogonal group of degree n or the n-dimensional rotation
group.
(v) U(n) := {U ∈Mn(C)|U ∗U = In}, where U ∗is the adjoint of U.
This group is called the n-dimensional unitary group.
(vi) SU(n) := {U ∈U(n)| det U = 1}. This group is called the n-
dimensional special unitary group.
Let G be a linear Lie group of degree n. Then it is shown that the set
g := {X ∈Mn(C)|etX ∈G, ∀t ∈R}
841
 

842
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is a real Lie algebra with commutator bracket.18 This Lie algebra is called
the Lie algebra of G.
Example F.2.
(i) The Lie algebra of GL(n, K) is gl(n, K) := Mn(K).
(ii) The Lie algebra SL(n, K) is sl(n, K) := {X ∈Mn(K)|Tr X = 0}.
(iii) The Lie algebra of O(n) is o(n) := {X ∈Mn(R)|tX = −X}.
(iv) The Lie algebra so(n) of SO(n) is equal to o(n).
(v) The Lie algebra of U(n) is u(n) := {X ∈Mn(C)|X∗= −X}.
(vi) The Lie algebra of SU(n) is su(n) := {X ∈u(n)|Tr X = 0}.
An important relation between a linear Lie group and its Lie algebra is
given by the following theorem19:
Theorem F.1. Let G be a connected linear Lie group and g be its Lie
algebra. Then, for any element g in G, there exist elements X1, . . . , XN ∈g
such that g = eX1eX2 · · · eXN .
F.2
Diﬀerential Representation of Lie Algebras
Let G be a linear Lie group and g be its Lie algebra. Let ρ : G →GL(V )
be a continuous representation of G (see Subsection 2.9.2) with V a ﬁnite
dimensional vector space. Then it is shown that, for all X ∈g,
σ(X) := lim
t→0
1
t
 ρ(etX) −1

exists, σ(X) ∈gl(V ) (the Lie algebra of everywhere deﬁned linear operators
on V ), and
ρ(etX) = etσ(X),
t ∈R, X ∈g.
Moreover, the mapping σ : g →gl(V ) is a representation of g (see Section
4.12). This representation σ is called the diﬀerential representation of
ρ and denoted as σ = dρ.
Since ρ is continuous, it follows that the kernel N(ρ) of ρ is a linear Lie
group. We denote the Lie algebra of N(ρ) by n(ρ). There is a beautiful
relation between n(ρ) and dρ:
Theorem F.2. n(ρ) = {X ∈gl(V )|dρ(X) = 0}(= ker dρ).
For a proof of this theorem, see, e.g., [Yamanouchi and Sugiura (1960),
p.118, [VII]].
