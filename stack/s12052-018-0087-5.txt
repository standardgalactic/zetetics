Book Review
Sexual selection occurs when animals of one sex com-
pete to mate with members of the other. Members of one 
sex (usually males) may fight each other for the privilege 
of mating with members of the other, as in deer or sea 
lions. In many other species, such as peacocks, males 
compete to attract mates by beauty of appearance or 
behavior, leaving females free to choose whom to mate 
with, a process called female choice (Darwin 1871; Fisher 
1930). Darwin developed the concept of sexual selec-
tion because he realized that natural selection could not 
explain the evolution of a male peacock’s array of long 
tail-feathers which, despite its beauty, almost annihilates 
its possessor’s ability to escape from predators (Darwin 
1871, vo1. 2, p. 97). Both books reviewed here focus on 
sexual selection by female choice: how males of differ-
ent species compete to persuade females to choose them 
as mates, what criteria females use to choose, and how 
their choices affect evolution. These books will interest 
this Journal’s readers because they suggest that evolution 
is not a purely utilitarian process: females often favor the 
evolution of beauty for its own sake, choosing males for 
their beauty in form, color and behavioral displays, char-
acteristics which may, like Hardy’s (1967, pp. 101, 119–
120, 150) number theory, be of no practical use whatever.
Darwin (1871, p. 257) distinguished non-adaptive 
sexual from adaptive natural selection very carefully, 
remarking that sexual selection applies to character-
istics which “serve only to give one male an advantage 
over another” although “the less well-endowed males, if 
time were allowed them… (would) pair with the females; 
and they would, in all other respects… be equally well 
adapted for their ordinary habits of life. In such cases 
sexual selection must have come into play, for the males 
have acquired their present structures, not from being 
better fitted to survive in the struggle for existence, but 
from having gained an advantage over other males.” In 
other words, Darwin defined sexual selection as a pro-
cess which did not enhance adaptation. This fact seems 
almost unknown to evolutionary biologists, too few of 
whom have read Darwin (1871) with sufficient attention.
Sexual selection was largely ignored for the first 
hundred years after Darwin (1871), because it seemed 
irrelevant to the battle to vindicate natural selection on 
variation arising without regard to its bearers’ needs as 
a viable cause of adaptation. Competition among males 
for females seemed an obvious aspect of the struggle 
for existence. If considered at all, female choice was 
invoked as an engine of adaptation, as (it was assumed) 
they would choose to mate with the best adapted males.

This attitude was too utilitarian for any to consider how 
beauty evolved. Biologists, moreover, were not subtle 
enough to see that genetic systems must be specifically 
adapted to make natural selection favor adaptive evolu-
tion. Williams (1966, p. 27) considered segregation dis-
tortion—biasing meiosis in heterozygotes in one’s own 
favor—as just another way an allele could acquire selec-
tive advantage. In fact, fair, unbiased meiosis is needed 
to ensure adaptive evolution (Leigh 1991) because this 
suppresses conflicts between the advantage of particu-
lar alleles and the common interest of the autosomal 
genes. As we shall see, sexual selection by female choice 
bears on both themes, the evolution of beauty, and 
resolving conflicts between individual advantage and 
the good of the group.
I first discuss Ryan’s book, a balanced, comprehen-
sive account of the bases of male attractiveness and 
female choice. Working with tungara frogs in Panama, 
he was first to document decisive influence of female 
choice on male mating success in the wild (Ryan 1980). 
He and his students have studied in detail the bases of 
and influences on sexual selection in these frogs (Ryan, 
chapter  2), revealing a marvelously complex story. A 
tungara frog’s call is either a simple whine (as in all calls 
of other species of its genus), or a whine followed by 
one or more chucks. The whine is species-specific, and 
the “amphibian papilla” in a tungara’s ear is tuned to be 
most responsive to whines of its own species. A tungara 
female placed between two speakers, one broadcasting 
only whines, the other, whines followed by chucks, is six 
times more likely to approach the speaker broadcasting 
whines with chucks. Whines with chucks also cause 
auditory nerves to send stronger signals to the brain. 
Although supplementing whines with attractive chucks 
costs little extra energy, males are reluctant to add 
chucks, which attract predatory bats that eat male frogs 
when they aggregate to call for mates. Females also pre-
fer deeper chucks, which larger males, more likely to 
fertilize all their eggs, make—because they hear them 
better! Ears of all species of this genus of frog have a 
“basal papilla,” tuned to 2200  Hz, even though only 
tungara frogs add chucks (averaging 2500 Hz) to their 
whines. Since the basal papilla is tuned to 2200  Hz, 
females can hear deeper, lower-frequency chucks more 
easily. Ryan’s discovery illustrates his care: many would 
have concluded that females choose larger males with 
deeper chucks because they fertilize more eggs, and 
stopped the study. Finally, females in other species 
whose males never make chucks are more attracted to 
synthetic calls with chucks added to the whines of their 
species. Chucks thus exploited a pre-existing prefer-
ence rather than coevolving with female preference for 
them. These conclusions are based on natural history, 
simple choice experiments, and studies of ear physiol-
ogy and auditory nerve activity.
Ryan next discusses constraints on, and general fea-
tures of, sexual selection. The range of an animal’s sen-
sory abilities is limited by the data-processing capacity 
of its brain, and its array of sensory abilities, which is 
shaped by what it needs to know to find food and escape 
predators. Thus nocturnal bats depend more on echolo-
cation and smell than vision for navigating and finding 
food. Moreover, animals respond to proportional differ-
ences in signal strength (Weber’s law): a tungara female 
that easily distinguishes between a one-chuck and a two-
chuck call hears little difference between six- and seven-
chuck calls. These factors all affect a female’s response to 
a male’s courtship signals. A female often integrates vari-
ous stimuli in choosing a mate. The stimulus that causes 
a Drosophila female to respond to a courting male is the 
odor of a specific male pheromone, but the sound of the 
male’s stylized wing-buzzing, the sight of his athletic 
dancing, and his taste (courting males do a lot of grop-
ing, tasting with their legs) influence her decision to mate 
(Ryan, pp. 38–39). Ryan discusses the molecular mecha-
nisms behind a female Drosophila’s preference for a par-
ticular odor and a particular taste.
A female’s first priority is choosing a mate of her spe-
cies. Thus, in the tungara genus, female brains and ears 
are tuned to respond only to whines of males of their spe-
cies. Some males, however, may more closely match the 
female’s criteria of being in her species, so they appear 
more attractive (beautiful?) to her, even if they enhance 
her reproduction no more than their fellows would. Here, 
sexual selection is purely aesthetic. Moreover, some 
female aesthetic preferences seem utterly unrelated to a 
male’s quality as a mate (whether he enables her to pro-
duce more or better offspring). Just as a female frog in 
species which never make chucks prefers synthetic calls 
where chucks are added to whines of her species, so a 
female platyfish in a species whose males lack sword-like 
tails prefers males of her species to whom the experi-
menter has added a sword-like tail (Ryan, pp. 41–42). 
A female does benefit by choosing a “quality” mate that 
enables her to have more or better offspring. Quality may 
reflect better health, better condition, or better genes. 
Thus calls of male tungara frogs infected by the poten-
tially lethal chytrid fungus, which could infect his mates, 
are far less attractive than those of normal males (Ryan, 
p. 79). But she rarely practices eugenics. Ryan’s third 
chapter is based primarily on birds, fish and frogs. These 
are easier to study experimentally, but their responses 
to sexual stimuli may be governed more often by fixed 
motor patterns (Lorenz 1977, pp. 55–57).
Next, Ryan discusses the roles of vision, hearing and 
smell on sexual selection—in decreasing order of ability

to localize the signal’s source and increasing order of 
the distance the signal can carry. Visual sexual beauty 
is analogous to a skilled artist’s painting in that, as 
an artist seeks to grip the viewer with his own emo-
tional response to a scene (Changeux 2012, p. 39), so 
the beauty in appearance or performance of a courting 
male is adapted to grip females with a desire to mate 
with him. As symmetry plays a subtle but often vital 
role in human art, in many species, including human 
beings, females prefer males of more symmetrical form 
(Ryan, pp. 66, 74–75). Color vision originally evolved to 
enhance foraging effectiveness, but males of many spe-
cies, like quetzals and birds of paradise, deploy color to 
enhance their beauty. What colors best attract females, 
however, depends on the light conditions prevailing 
where males of the species court (Ryan, pp. 60–61). In 
some species, such as bowerbirds, males build struc-
tures to enhance their attractiveness. Bowerbirds of a 
few species build impressively large, well-constructed 
huts with piles of brightly colored objects placed in spe-
cific parts of the forecourt. Finally, some males would 
prefer mates with unachievable properties. Female fri-
tillary butterflies attract males by flapping their wings: 
the faster they flap, the more attractive they are. A 
sped-up movie showing a female flapping her wings ten 
times faster than is energetically possible is, however, 
even more attractive (Ryan, p. 62).
Most frogs, grasshoppers, crickets, cicadas and katy-
dids, and many birds, use sound as a primary means of 
calling, and arousing sexual desire in, potential mates. 
These calls allow females to identify males of their own 
species. Frog calls and nocturnal insect sounds, however, 
also attract predators and parasites, which can severely 
limit calling. Indeed, a male Asian corn borer moth 
mates with a female by mimicking the “terminal buzz” of 
a bat catching an insect, freezing her in such fear that she 
cannot resist mating with him (Ryan, pp. 93–94). As with 
color, different sounds communicate best in different 
habitats, so grassland birds’ calls have higher frequencies 
and faster pulse rates than forest birds’ calls (Ryan, p. 86). 
Although a male tungara frog can keep making the same 
call again and again without boring the female, a nightin-
gale or song sparrow must vary his song to keep a female 
interested. A nightingale may have a repertoire of 150 
songs (Ryan, p. 87). Healthier song sparrows have larger 
song repertoires (Ryan, pp. 88–89). Finally, a male must 
make himself heard above the multitude of his fellow 
callers. Some amplify their calls by calling from burrows 
or cavities whose length matches the call’s wavelength. 
Experiment showed that a certain frog in a cavity partly 
filled with water matched the wavelength of his call to the 
length of the unfilled part of his cavity. When some of the 
water was removed, the frog increased the wavelength of 
his call to match the enlargement of the unfilled part of 
his cavity (Ryan, p. 97).
Olfactory receptors are usually neurons, so odor is 
communicated more directly to the brain than other sen-
sory modes. Perfume has a notorious impact on some 
men. Many animals, such as fruit-eating bats, Drosophila, 
and nectar-eating moths find food by smell: Drosophila 
and moths also use odor to attract mates. Male moths 
have separate sensors on their antennae for flower scents 
vs the pheromone females of their species use to attract 
mates (Ryan, p. 110). The pheromone is a species-specific 
mixture of two chemicals. Males can be very sensitive to 
their females’ pheromone: the French insect behaviorist 
Fabre (1916) tells how a large female moth emerged from 
her cocoon in his house, ready to mate, and filled it with 
the males she attracted. He rarely caught this species oth-
erwise. Drosophila court on rotting fruit, where females 
lay eggs, so the smell of such fruit also excites sexual 
interest (Ryan, p. 111). Finally, a rodent’s odor reflects 
the genetics of its primary immunity locus (MHC). Mat-
ing with an individual with different MHC genes yields 
healthier young, and odor allows these rodents (and 
human beings?) to choose mates with different MHC 
genes (Ryan, p. 118).
Ryan then discusses factors which makes a female’s 
sexual responsiveness vary in time: ovulation time, and 
age (as menopause approaches, a woman is more anxious 
to reproduce). In many promiscuous species, females 
are more likely to mate with a male when they see oth-
ers choose him (Ryan, p. 135). He ends by discussing how 
male traits and female preferences can evolve to match. 
First, selection favors those females that choose mates 
that best enhance their reproductive success. These 
mates must be of her species and should be more fer-
tile, healthier, and often, more likely to provide resources 
benefiting their offspring. Color is often a good index 
of health, so selection often favors females that choose 
brighter-colored mates. Health is one thing, but Ryan 
finds little evidence that females evolve to prefer males 
that provide their young with better genes (Ryan, p. 151). 
Another possibility is coevolution between a “sexy” male 
trait, which may diminish fitness, and female preference 
for that trait. The more attractive the male trait, the more 
a female benefits her progeny by preferring it, since the 
increased attractiveness of her sons increases mating suc-
cess enough to make up for their lower survival. This cir-
cumstance may give rise to runaway coevolution between 
male trait and female preference (Lande 1981). Ryan (p. 
152) cites one instance of such coevolution but finds few 
others; I find that polygenic models do not easily yield the 
covariance of male trait with female preference needed to 
drive a runaway (Leigh, unpublished). Finally, males may 
evolve a trait exploiting a pre-existing female preference,

such as that of female tungaras for whines with chucks, 
or of platyfish for males with sword-like tails. Male fritil-
lary butterflies, moreover would prefer females that flap 
their wings much faster than is actually possible, just as 
female widow birds would prefer males with tails longer 
than any existing in nature (Ryan, pp. 62, 65). Similarly, 
many human beings enjoy “Barbie dolls” whose figures 
represent unrealizable extremes of “attractive” female 
form. I have passed over Ryan’s discussion of sexual selec-
tion in human beings, which he understands far less well 
than frogs, fish, moths and butterflies. He often writes as 
if sexual selection in human beings were best studied in 
singles bars, although when analyzing the dangers of por-
nography (p. 162), he remembers that to reproduce, most 
human beings must form stable relationships with part-
ners willing to cooperate in child-rearing.
Ryan’s book is a balanced, clear, well-written study 
of factors affecting how sexual selection works. What 
does this tell us about the evolution of beauty? Ryan (p. 
19) says that beauty is what appeals to the mind of the 
chooser. The view of what is beautiful, however, must be 
sufficiently similar among members of an interbreeding 
population that they mate with each other. This does little 
to explain why human beings find the colors, shapes and 
sounds of courting males of many species so beautiful 
(Darwin 1871, vol. 1, p. 63; Haldane 1932 p. 162).
Prum’s book focuses on birds and, less extensively, 
human beings. He began watching and identifying birds 
at age 10, and learned in college, to his delight, that bird-
watching suited him to study bird evolution. He has 
become a naturalist who really understands his birds. He 
views beauty as expressing a relation between an object 
and its observer. He seeks to infer a female bird’s subjec-
tive reaction to the beauty of her suitors by whom she 
chooses to mate with. How are a male’s ornaments and 
performances adapted to grip her with a desire to mate 
with him? Changeux (2012, p. 39) artist faces a similar 
problem: how to grip a viewer with his emotional reac-
tion to a particular scene. Prum is inspired by Darwin’s 
(1871) theory of sexual selection by female choice, and 
rightly fascinated by the great role female choice can 
play in evolution. He also argues, often convincingly, that 
females sometimes favor beauty for its own sake, even 
when it lowers the fitness for making a living of both sig-
naler and chooser.
An unfortunate drone bass mars the book, which I will 
discuss before focusing on his book’s many good quali-
ties, for this book is one of the very few great books it has 
been my privilege to review. He views himself as a lone 
advocate of Darwin’s theory of selection by female choice, 
facing monolithic opposition from those who assert that 
females use criteria that choose males with good genes 
(or other useful properties). Ryan’s book reveals that 
others realize the arbitrariness of female choice. Ryan 
says that females can choose beauty without regard to 
usefulness, although he also finds abundant evidence 
that female criteria of beauty usually favor healthy males 
(how could a feeble Vogelkop bowerbird find the energy 
to build the huge bower females expect of him?). Ryan is 
no part of the implacable, monolithic opposition Prum 
sees himself facing. Prum’s (2003) harsh attitude to the 
few opponents of his views on bird ancestry, moreover, 
sits oddly with his complaints about his own treatment.
Prum (chapter  1), however, rightly emphasizes the 
opposition Darwin’s theory of female choice originally 
faced. Wallace insisted that non-human females were 
incapable of choice; Mivart thought the same of women! 
So many found the idea of female choice so revolting and 
so dangerous that the idea slept for a century. Only Fisher 
(1930) accepted the importance of female choice, despite 
his social conservatism and attraction to eugenics. Prum 
criticizes adaptationism because, like Lewontin, he finds 
adaptation a dangerously normative concept. He thinks 
that sexual selection by female choice leads to a more 
diverse, beautiful world. He also criticizes the population 
geneticists’ measure of fitness as being too indiscrimi-
nate. Fisher (1930), however, an ocean-going adapta-
tionist (and eugeneticist) whose Malthusian parameter 
refined the population geneticists’ fitness concept, first 
showed how non-adaptive female preferences might 
evolve.
What has Prum done with Darwin’s idea? First, Prum 
(pp. 54–63) amplifies Darwin’s (1871, vol. 2, p. 92) con-
vincing argument that the refined beauty of the male 
Argus pheasant’s display “may serve as a charm for the 
female, and for no other purpose.” Then he discusses 
manakins, small birds whose males compete to attract 
females by species-specific combinations of beautiful 
appearance, elaborate, acrobatic dances, and associ-
ated sound effects. Prum (p. 90) argues that their diver-
sity of displays could only be driven by female choice, 
choosing mates on aesthetic criteria, not the goodness 
of their genes. He must be right: sexual selection gener-
ates far more diversity, far faster, and seemingly far more 
capriciously than does natural selection (West-Eberhard 
1983). Then Prum (pp. 126–134) shows that the wings 
of male clubwinged manakins are uniquely deformed so 
that the males can make music with them. Female wings 
show correlated, but much milder deformation. Here, 
female choice decreases adaptedness for making a living 
in both chooser and chosen.
Next comes Prum’s most important and original 
argument. When conflict arises between males trying 
to force females to mate with them and females defend-
ing their freedom to choose their mate, female choice 
can prevail. In dense populations of non-territorial 

Page 5 of 6

ducks, 40% of female copulations are forced by rogue 
males, but males that females chose as mates sire 
95–98% of their young. In these populations, complex 
penises designed to fertilize the most resistant female 
have coevolved with equally complex vaginas designed 
to prevent forced fertilizations. Female choice has pre-
vailed, at a cost: resisting forced matings often injures, 
and may kill, resisters. The great advantage of breed-
ing from nonviolent males outweighs these costs. In 
less dense populations of territorial ducks, female 
choice reigns uncontested (Prum, pp. 157–174). Next, 
he turns to bowerbirds. The most basal court-building 
bowerbirds, tooth-billed bowerbirds, build no bowers 
but make their courts attractive by paving them with 
large green leaves. Females inspecting the court are 
easily forced to mate. Recent work shows that bow-
ers are designed both to attract females and to pro-
tect them from forced matings. Females prefer males 
whose bowers they can look at without being forced 
to mate (Prum, pp. 194–204). Finally, most birds lack 
penises, thanks probably to female choice, because a 
female must will it for a penis-less male to fertilize her. 
Prum (pp. 178–180) thinks this circumstance allowed 
monogamy to become prevalent among birds. Female 
choice must be adaptive, for female reproduction is 
usually what limits a population’s growth.
Manakin dances are ritualized contests, which Huiz-
inga (1950, pp. 13, 76) classified as a form of play. Male 
manakins form leks, groups of males competing for 
mates, each with his own court especially prepared for 
his performances, because females mate only with males 
in leks where their performances are easily compared 
(Prum, pp. 209–212). Huizinga (1950, p. 47) says of ritu-
alized contests among birds that “It is doubly remarkable 
that birds, phylogenetically so far removed from human 
beings, should have so much in common with them. 
Woodcocks perform dances, crows hold flying-contests, 
bowerbirds… decorate their” bowers. Huizinga views 
play—especially ritualized contest—as civilizing activi-
ties. Primitive law courts replaced violent feuds by ritual-
ized contests (Hyams 2003), which originally served more 
to keep the peace than to do justice (Huizinga 1950, pp. 
78–79). Similarly, by choosing males from leks, female 
manakins have promoted social, even cooperative, behav-
ior among a lek’s males. Males generally remain in the 
same lek all their lives, so leks are stable groups. Males 
that disrupt each other’s performances cause females to 
choose other, more beautifully ordered, leks, Male coop-
eration reaches an apogee in Chiroxiphia, where a lek’s 
five or more males join in a cooperative dance which, if 
successful, attracts mates for the alpha male. The hier-
archy of the dance establishes who succeeds the current 
alpha male when he dies. The ritualized contests females 
favor have turned males into social animals that rely on 
each other’s company (Prum, pp. 211–221).
Prum closes with a long discussion of sexual selec-
tion among human beings. I highlight those parts that 
emphasize the far-reaching importance of female choice 
in human evolution. Male orangutans, gorillas and chim-
panzees mate with any female in estrous they meet. 
Human males—men—are much choosier, because for 
them, mating, especially repeated mating with the same 
woman, normally entailed commitment to help raise the 
resulting young (Prum, p. 235). Men, like male bonobos, 
mate frequently with females that are not currently fer-
tile, only bonobos mate promiscuously to maintain troop 
solidarity, whereas human beings usually did so to main-
tain the child-rearing pair bond (Prum, pp. 231–232). 
In great apes, bonobos excepted, females have little 
choice in who mates with them. Invading males cause a 
third of the deaths among gorilla infants, because killing 
infants brings their mothers into estrous sooner (Prum, 
p. 287). Men almost never murder stepchildren for their 
own reproductive benefit: male–male violence is much 
diminished among human beings. Safety from murder by 
rogue males allows a human child a much longer period 
of dependence during which it can learn language and 
the social skills it needs, and its brain can develop its full 
cognitive potential (Prum, pp. 289–290). In orangutans 
and gorillas, male fangs (canines) are much longer than 
females’, and adult males weigh over twice as much as 
females, giving males coercive power over females. Men, 
however, average only 16% heavier than women, their 
canines are not much longer than their other teeth, and 
they are equally long in the two sexes. All this was already 
true for Australopithecus 3.5 million years ago. Chim-
panzees and bonobos are intermediate in these respects 
between the other great apes and ourselves. Prum (pp. 
294–297) thinks the diminished differences in size 
and weaponry between men and women made it much 
harder for men to force matings on women, and credits 
these changes to female choice of less threatening males, 
which tended to liberate women from male sexual vio-
lence. Among other effects of mate choice by women was 
the evolution of monogamy in hunter-gatherer tribes, 
which are fiercely egalitarian (Boehm 2012). The advent 
of agriculture and market economies allowed economic 
inequality and social hierarchy to arise, which compro-
mised female freedom to choose (Prum, pp. 331–332).
What, in the end, has Prum accomplished? He has 
shown that in birds, female choice drove the evolution of 
great beauty, time and again. Moreover, this beauty often 
does not help its possessors make a living: it evolved 
only for its own sake. Prum has exploded a great many 
adaptationist myths about human sexuality. Like Fisher 
(1930), I am an adaptationist, but I have no use for the

No more than Ryan, however, has Prum shown how 
female choice can favor an aesthetics we share so exten-
sively with birds (Darwin 1871; Huizinga 1950). I know of 
only two phenomena that may spread aesthetics beyond 
a single species. Both involve mutualisms among species 
where attracting partners plays a crucial role. The first is 
“social mimicry” (Moynihan 1968, pp. 316–317), where 
tropical birds that forage together in mixed-species flocks 
often share markings of similar color and pattern that 
reinforce the join-and-follow responses that cause flock-
ing. In flocking montane tanagers these can be strikingly 
beautiful. The second arises among plants competing for 
pollinators and seed dispersers (West-Eberhard 1983, 
pp. 169–170). Plants attract these animals by the beauty 
of color, pattern, form and/or scent of their flowers and 
fruit. But why do human beings so often find these flow-
ers and fruit beautiful?
Prum also argued persuasively from comparative evi-
dence for the “civilizing” influence of female choice in 
suppressing male sexual violence. In birds, he has given 
three evolutionary series of female choice countering 
male coercion. What changes between chimpanzee and 
australopithecine ecology so favored female choice in 
the latter, however, is a total mystery to me. I hope future 
work fills this gap, for it would greatly amplify our under-
standing of our human heritage.
