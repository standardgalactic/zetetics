Stochastic mechanics is regarded as a physical theory to explain quantum mechanics with classical terms such
that some of the quantum mechanics paradoxes can be avoided. Here we propose a new variational principle
to uncover more insights on stochastic mechanics. According to this principle, information measures, such as
relative entropy and Fisher information, are imposed as constraints on top of the least action principle. This
principle not only recovers Nelson’s theory and consequently, the Schr¨odinger equation, but also clears an
unresolved issue in stochastic mechanics on why multiple Lagrangians can be used in the variational method
and yield the same theory. The concept of forward and backward paths provides an intuitive physical picture
for stochastic mechanics. Each path conﬁguration is considered as a degree of freedom and has its own law of
dynamics. Thus, the variation principle proposed here can be a new tool to derive more advanced stochastic
theory by including additional degrees of freedom in the theory.
The structure of Lagrangian developed
here shows that some terms in the Lagrangian are originated from information constraints. This suggests a
Lagrangian may need to include both physical and informational terms in order to have a complete description
of the dynamics of a physical system.

INTRODUCTION
Although quantum mechanics is one of the most suc-
cessful physical theories and has been experimentally
conﬁrmed extensively, there are many fundamental ques-
tions still left unanswered.
For instance, the origin of
probability in quantum mechanics is not clearly under-
stood. It is still a curiosity why the probability is calcu-
lated as the absolute square of a complex number. The
meaning of wave function, especially the interpretation
of wave function collapse in a measurement, has been
always a debated topic. These questions were not fully
addressed by the traditional Copenhagen Interpretation.
Over the years in the modern history of quantum physics,
many more theories and interpretations have been de-
veloped1,2.
Among these theories and interpretations,
stochastic mechanics is of particular interest because it
aims to derive quantum mechanics from classical physics
concepts with an additional assumption that a physical
system is constantly undergoing a stochastic process3,4.
There is no need to introduce concepts such as probabil-
ity amplitude, wave function, or Born’s rule, as funda-
mental elements for the quantum theory. Instead, they
are secondary and can be derived.
Historically, the investigation of the connection be-
tween quantum mechanics and diﬀusion process was
started
in
the
early
days
of
quantum
mechanics.
Schr¨odinger initiated this line of investigation in 1932
by asking a question regarding Brownian motion that
is later termed as Schr¨odinger Bridge Problem (SBP)5.
SBP essentially aims to searching the most likely ran-
dom evolution that Brownian particles have taken from
an initial end point to another end point, provided the
a)Electronic mail: jianhao.yang@alumni.utoronto.ca
probability densities of the two end points are given. In
the context of Markov diﬀusion process, the solution of
SBP was found to admit a form that is similar to the
Born’s rule in quantum mechanics7,8. A more ambitious
attempt to formulate quantum mechanics directly based
on diﬀusion process was put forward by Nelson in 196610,
based on an early work due to F´enyes who recognized
the Schr¨odinger equation can be understood as a partial
diﬀerential equation (PDE) for a Markov process9. Nel-
son’s theory became the most well-known formulation of
stochastic mechanics. In this theory, a rather arbitrary
deﬁnition of the mean stochastic acceleration was postu-
lated. Then, together with the Fokker-Planck equation,
Nelson derived two non-linear PDEs, which when com-
bined together through a set of mathematical transfor-
mation, lead to the Schr¨odinger equation. Subsequent
researches12,17,18 focus on the variational principle that
would serves as underlined foundation to recover the Nel-
son theory. Among them, Yasue’s approach12 is of im-
portance. It not only successfully derives the stochastic
acceleration from the least action principle, but also pro-
poses a generic stochastic calculus for variation. Guerra
and Morato17 give another variational approach that can
recover Nelson’ theory, but with a diﬀerent structure
of Lagrangian, leaving a mystery on why multiple La-
grangian can result in the same Nelson’s theory.
More recent researches on stochastic mechanics are mo-
tivated by two fronts. First, since the source of the ran-
domness that causes the system to perform Brownian
motion is not yet completely known, it is desirable to in-
vestigate such source. One promising conjecture is that
the space metrics itself is stochastic20,21. A particle in
such a stochastic space is shown to constantly perform
Brownian motion. Given the eﬀect of the randomness
of spacetime metrics is universal, the resulting quantum
eﬀect is also univeral to all systems in the spacetime. An-
other proposal, which is less universal since it only ap-

2
plies to charged systems, is that the vacuum electromag-
netic ﬁeld at absolute zero temperature degree is a real
radiation. A charged particle constantly interacts with
such electromagnetic ﬁeld. The quantum eﬀects are pro-
duced by the electromagnetic noise combined with clas-
sical dynamics22,23. Second, in wake of the advance on
quantum information, there are considerable amount of
interest to explore the informational foundation of quan-
tum mechanics. Information concepts such as entropy,
Bayes’ Theorem, Fisher information, entanglement, etc.,
can be considered as foundational elements in construct-
ing quantum theory29–31,35–37,39. Some eﬀorts18,19 have
been put forward to recover Nelson’s theory with entropy
as a key element. However, these formulations depend
on other assumptions such as conservation of energy19 or
rather arbitrary constraints in the variation process18.
There are opened questions on how stochastic mechan-
ics can explain quantum phenomena, such as entangle-
ment, locality, the 2π periodicity of the wave function.
Readers are referred to the well known review papers3,4
and a more recent paper26.
One of the subtleties is
that to what extend stochastic mechanics can rely on
the classical probability theory to explain quantum me-
chanics speciﬁc phenomena, as exempliﬁed by the multi-
time correlations issue42,43. One should be very cautious
in equating quantum mechanics to classical probability
theory.
Nevertheless, these challenges will continue to
inspire future researches to bring new physical insights
into stochastic mechanics.
In summary, stochastic mechanics remains a promising
theory to explain quantum mechanics classically.
The
theory can be further developed in multiple fronts. This
paper is motivated by exploring possible informational
foundation of stochastic mechanics.
By doing this we
wish to uncover additional physical insights on quan-
tum mechanics. The goal of this work is to take a new
look on the variational principle, by examining the struc-
ture of Lagrangian and constraints related to informa-
tion measure. We will show that the eﬀorts are indeed
fruitful.
By deﬁning proper Lagrangian and imposing
constraint of relative entropy for both forward and back-
ward path conﬁgurations, we are able to derive the time
dynamics for both path conﬁgurations using the Yasue
stochastic calculus. From them, the Nelson theory and
the Schr¨odinger equation are recovered. Furthermore, by
adding the Fisher information production into the vari-
ational approach, we can also derive the Nelson theory
using the Guerra and Morato version of Lagrangian but
with the Yasue stochastic calculus. This clears the mys-
tery mentioned earlier. There are several new physical
insights our derivation brings in. First, the concept of
forward and back paths provides an intuitive physical
picture to consider the dynamics of a diﬀusing particle.
It gives more insight on the diﬀerence between classical
and quantum mechanics in terms of degree of freedom
needed to describe a system completely. Second, from
methodology perspective, the variational approach pre-
sented here can be naturally extended to include new de-
grees of freedom. It paves a possible way to derive Dirac
equation using the stochastic variation method once the
theory is formulated in a relativistic setting. Third, The
constraint of zero relative entropy imposed to the least
action principle shows that the forward and backward
paths, although both are needed for a complete descrip-
tion of a diﬀusing particle, are indistinguishable through
measurement. This echoes the idea of interfering alterna-
tive proposed in the path integral formulation of quantum
mechanics. Lastly, the structure of Lagrangian developed
in our works shows that there is intrinsic connection be-
tween the physical variables and quantities related infor-
mation measure. It is subtle to distinguish them when
writing down a Lagrangian that consists many terms.
This suggests that it is possible to reconsider from the
information measure perspective the meaning of certain
terms in the Lagrangian density used in classical or quan-
tum ﬁeld theory.
Although the formulation presented here is mathemat-
ically equivalent to the Nelson theory, we believe the
method and the conceptual insights brought up in this
work can be valuable for future investigation on the foun-
dation of quantum mechanics.
The paper is organized as followings. Section II brieﬂy
reviews Nelson’s theory and the stochastic calculus of
variation proposed by Yasue. In Section III we present
the main results. An information measure, the relative
entropy for the froward and backward path conﬁgura-
tions, is introduced. We then prove that for a Markov
diﬀusion process, the relative entropy must be zero. Us-
ing this as a constraint in the least action principle, we
derive the Nelson theory in Section III B. In Section III C,
another information measure, the Fisher information, is
introduced. This allows us to recover Nelson’s theory us-
ing Guerra and Morato version of Lagrangian. Section
III D compares three sets of Lagrangian that can be used
to derive Nelson’s theory when coupled with proper in-
formation measures. In Section IV, we discuss the physi-
cal insights brought in by our formulation, point out the
limitations of our derivation, and summarize the conclu-
sions.

STOCHASTIC MECHANICS AND VARIATION
This section brieﬂy reviews the stochastic mechanics
and emphasizes on the formulation that is referred in
later sections. For convenience we will adopt the mathe-
matical notations in Nelson’s works 11.
A.
Nelson’s Theory
The basic assumption for the stochastic mechanics is
to consider a system as a point particle and constantly
undergoes a Brownian motion.
Let ξ(t) be a Markov

3
diﬀusion process1 such that
dξi(t) = bi
+(ξ(t), t)dt + dW i
+(t)
(1)
where i
=
1, 2, 3 is the spatial index.
b+(ξ(t), t)
is a vector-valued function which meaning will be
given shortly.
W i
+(t) is the standard, independent
Wiener process with properties E[dW i
+(t)] = 0 and
E[dW i
+(t)dW j
+(t)] = 2νδijdt, where E[·] denotes the ab-
solute expectation value. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient ν is
set to be inversely proportional to the mass of the sys-
tem ν = ℏ/2m and ℏis determined later.
Given that the stochastic process ξ(t) is not diﬀer-
entiable, the forward and backward derivatives are de-
ﬁned to replace the regular derivative. For a real-valued
stochastic process f(ξ(t)) (also denoted as F(t) for sim-
pler notation), its forward derivative D+ and backward
derivative D−are deﬁned as10
D+F(t) =
lim
dt→0+ Et[F(t + dt) −F(t)
dt
]
D−F(t) =
lim
dt→0+ Et[F(t) −F(t −dt)
dt
]
(2)
where Et[·] is a conditional expectation operator with
respect to the conﬁguration at time t. More precisely, the
conditional expectation should be denoted as Eξ(t)[·], we
use Et[·] for simpler notation. For instance, given t′ ̸= t,
Et[f(ξ(t))] =
Z
f(ξ′(t′))p(ξ′, t′|ξ, t)dξ′
(3)
where p(ξ′, t′|ξ, t) is the conditional probability density.
With this deﬁnition, it becomes clear that D+ξi(t) =
bi
+(ξ(t), t) is the mean forward velocity.
The diﬀusion
process can also be written as
dξi(t) = bi
−(ξ(t), t)dt + dW i
−(t)
(4)
where dW i
−(t) has the same property as dW i
+(t) except
it is independent of ξ(s) for s ≥t. By the deﬁnition in
(2), D−ξi(t) = bi
−(ξ(t), t), which is the mean backward
velocity. With the deﬁnitions (1), (2), (4), one obtains
the following explicit expressions
D+f(ξ(t), t) = (∂/∂t + bi
+∇i + ν∆)f(ξ(t), t)
D−f(ξ(t), t) = (∂/∂t + bi
−∇i −ν∆)f(ξ(t), t)
(5)
Let ρ(x, t) be the probability density of the diﬀusion
process at position x at time t.
Nelson’s theory as-
sumes ρ(x, t) satisﬁes both the forward and backward
1 We limit the study here to Markov diﬀusion process only, even
though part of Nelson’s formulation can be app lied to non-
Markov process.
Note that the Brownian motion here is an
energy conservation process, rather than a classical dissipative
diﬀusion, see the detailed explanation in section 14 of Nelson’s
book11.
Fokker-Planck equations. From the forward and back-
ward Fokker-Planck equations, the continuity equation
for ρ(x, t) is obtained.
∂ρ
∂t = −1
2∇i((bi
+ + bi
−)ρ).
(6)
More crucially, the following identity is also derived,
bi
+ −bi
−= 2ν∇iln(ρ)
(7)
A more elegant derivation of (7) is given based on Bayes’
theorem19
p(x′|x) = p(x|x′)ρ(x′)
ρ(x)
,
(8)
and the deﬁnition of (2), and (3) by taking x = ξ(t) and
x′ = ξ′(t′). This approach has its advantage since Bayes’
theorem is more general in probability theory and there
is no need to depend on the Fokker-Planck equation.
The drift velocity is deﬁned as vi = (bi
+ + bi
−)/2, and
the so-called “osmotic velocity”, which is somewhat mis-
leading and will be further discussed later, is deﬁned as
ui = (bi
+ −bi
−)/2 = ν∇ilnρ. Multiplying 1/ρ to both
sides of the continuity equation (6), and taking the gra-
dient of both sides, one gets the Nelson ﬁrst equation
∂ui
∂t = −ν∆vi −∇i(vjuj).
(9)
The mean acceleration is deﬁned somewhat arbitrarily as
ai = 1
2(D+bi
−+ D−bi
+).
(10)
Assuming Newton’s second law holds F = ma = −∇φ,
where φ is the external potential, and applying (5) to bi
−
and bi
+ in (10), lead to the Nelson’s second equation
∂vi
∂t = (ui∇i)ui −(vi∇i)vi + ν∆ui −∇iφ
m .
(11)
Eqs. (9) and (11) give the complete description of the dy-
namics of a Brownian particle in the context of stochas-
tic mechanics.
By introducing a series of mathemati-
cal transformations, Eqs. (9) and (11) can be combined
into a single linear PDE with complex variable.
Let
∇iR = m
ℏui, ∇iS = m
ℏvi, and ψ = eR+iS, one can verify
that (9) and (11) are equivalent to
iℏ∂ψ
∂t = (−ℏ2
2m∆+ φ)ψ,
(12)
which is the Schr¨odinger equation. Given ∇iR = ui/(2ν)
and ui = ν∇ilnρ, we have ρ = e2R. Thus,
ρ = |ψ|2 = e2R.
(13)
The Born’s rule is naturally derived rather than being
postulated.

4
The description of a diﬀusing particle in stochastic me-
chanics diﬀers from the classical mechanics in that it re-
quires two non-linear PDEs, rather than just one. Extra
degree of freedom is introduced through the forward and
backward velocities. Note that (9) is essentially derived
from the Fokker-Planck equations for ρ and the iden-
tity (7). This indicates that a component of Schr¨odinger
equation comes from the probability theory itself, which
we will explore later in terms of information quantity.
For now, we turn back to the deﬁnition of mean accel-
eration (10), which is rather arbitrary.
It is desirable
to justify (10) from a ﬁrst principle. This motivates the
development of a variational approach.
B.
Stochastic Calculus of Variations
There are multiple variational methods proposed to
recover Nelson’s theory based on the least action princi-
ple12,17,18 or the conserved energy constraint19. The Ya-
sue’s variation method is of particular interest here, since
we will extensively use its stochastic calculus, which we
give a brief overview here. More rigorous description of
the stochastic calculus can be found in Ref.12.
In Yasue’s stochastic calculus, the three variables,
(ξ, b+, b−), or equivalently, (ξ, D+ξ, D−ξ), are consid-
ered independent during the variation process.
Thus,
the Lagrangian is denoted as L(ξ, D+ξ, D−ξ). Suppose
a particle moves from point a (i.e., ξ(ta) = xa) to point
b (i.e., ξ(tb) = xb), the stochastic action is deﬁned as
Jab = E[
Z tb
ta
L(ξ, D+ξ, D−ξ)dt].
(14)
Here E[·] denotes the absolute expectation along the path
ξ(ta) →ξ(tb) and ta < tb. Now let the path ξ vary but
keep the end points ﬁxed as xa and xb. The variation it-
self is a stochastic process, denoted as z(t) for ta < t < tb
and z(ta) = z(tb) = 0. The variation of stochastic action,
due to the variation of ξ, is δJab = Jab(ξ + z) −Jab(ξ).
Let ∥· ∥denote the Euclidean vector norm. Deﬁning
∥z∥:=
sup
t∈[ta,tb]
(∥z(t)∥+ ∥D+z(t)∥+ ∥D−z(t)∥),
(15)
we say ξ(t) is critical for Jab if δJab = o(∥z∥) holds for
all time interval [ta, tb] and for arbitrary variation z(t),
and with the condition that Jab has ﬁnite energy. To ob-
tain the explicit expression of δJab, one performs Taylor’s
expansion of L(ξ, D+ξ, D−ξ),
δJab = E[
Z tb
ta
{ ∂L
∂ξi zi +
∂L
∂D+ξi D+zi +
∂L
∂D−ξi D−zi}dt].
(16)
To proceed further, we need the following identity11 for
stochastic processes f(t) and zi(t)
Z tb
ta
E[f(t)D−zi(t)]dt = −
Z tb
ta
E[zi(t)D+f(t)]dt
+ E[f(t)zi(t)|tb
ta],
(17)
Due to the property of Markov process, the expectation
operator E[·] and the integration over t can exchange
the order (see Appendix B). This allows us to apply (17)
to (16) by taking f(t) = ∂L/∂D±ξi. Recalling z(ta) =
z(tb) = 0, and replacing D+ξi = bi
+ and D−ξi = bi
−, we
obtain
δJab = E[
Z tb
ta
{ ∂L
∂ξi −D−( ∂L
∂bi
+
) −D+( ∂L
∂bi
−
)}zidt]. (18)
Since z(t) is an arbitrary stochastic process, δJab = 0 if
and only if
∂L
∂ξi −D−( ∂L
∂bi
+
) −D+( ∂L
∂bi
−
) = 0.
(19)
Deﬁning the Lagrangian for the diﬀusion process ξ(t) as
LY (ξ, b+, b−) = 1
2[1
2m(b+)ibi
+ + 1
2m(b−)ibi
−] −φ(ξ),
(20)
and substituting it into (19), we have
1
2m(D+bi
−+ D−bi
+) + ∇iφ = 0.
(21)
This justiﬁes the deﬁnition of mean acceleration in (10).
The choice of Lagrangian in (20) appears to be intu-
itive as it assumes the kinetic energy is the average of
kinetic energy associate with forward and backward ve-
locities. However, there are multiple variables related to
velocities, such as b+, b+, v and u. There is ﬂexibility
to deﬁne the kinetic energy and consequently the La-
grangian. For instance, Guerra and Morato suggested a
diﬀerent Lagrangian17 as
LG(ξ, b+) = 1
2m(b+)ibi
+ + ℏ
2∇ibi
+ −φ(ξ).
(22)
Using LG with a diﬀerent variation approach, they are
able to recover Nelson’s theory as well. It has been a
mystery why two diﬀerent Lagragians lead to the same
result 2. We will later show that both versions of La-
grangian can be uniﬁed in our variation method. Another
interesting point is that the Lagrangian in (20) indicates
that the Lagrangian can be split into two parts, one for
forward path conﬁguration and the other for backward
path conﬁguration. One might ask if there is dynamics
equation that can be derived for each of the path conﬁgu-
ration using the variation calculus. These are interesting
questions to be answered next.

RESULTS
A.
Relative Entropy in Path Space
To search the dynamics equations for the forward and
backward path conﬁgurations, we ﬁrst introduce the rela-
2 Nelson stated11 that “We have seen this is so, but I wish I un-
derstood why it is so.”

tive entropy of the forward and backward paths, as this in
the end leads to a constraint in the stochastic variational
principle we will propose. Note that the terms forward or
backward do not refer to the direction of time. Instead,
it just refers to a path conﬁguration that is described by
either the forward mean velocity or the backward mean
velocity.
Suppose a particle undergoes a Markov diﬀusion pro-
cess ξ(t) from ta →tb. We divide the time interval [ta, tb]
into t1 = ta, t2 = t1 + ∆t, ..., tn = tb = t1 + n∆t, and the
corresponding local position variables are x1, x2, ..., xn.
Conﬁguration γ+
ab : t ∈[ta, tb] 7→γ+
ab(t) = (x(t), b+(x(t))
is deﬁned as a forward sample path from xa to xb, while
conﬁguration γ−
ab : t ∈[ta, tb] 7→γ−
ab(t) = (x(t), b−(x(t))
is deﬁned as a backward sample path. It is important
to note that γ+
ab and γ−
ab share the same position vari-
able x(t) but diﬀer by the velocity variables. If one plots
the trajectory paths of γ+
ab and γ−
ab in the four dimen-
sion space-time, both paths overlap. But if one plots the
paths in the phase spaces deﬁned next, they are diﬀer-
ent. In the phase space for a diﬀusing point particle, the
particle is identiﬁed by Γ : {(x, b+, b−)}. We can en-
vision the phase space Γ comprises two classical phase
subspaces Γ+ : {(x, b+)} and Γ−: {(x, b−)}. Plotting
γ+
ab in Γ+ and γ−
ab in Γ−gives two diﬀerent trajectory
paths, as shown in Fig.1b.
The probability density within a space measure Dx =
dx1dx2...dxn is ρ(x1, t1; x2, t2; ..., xn, tn). In other words,
the regular probability measure on the path space dP =
ρDx. By the Markov properties, the probability density
for the forward path can be written as3
ρ+(x1, ..., xn) = ρ(x1)p(x2|x1)p(x3|x2)...p(xn|xn−1),
(23)
so that dP+ = ρ+Dx. Similarly the probability density
for the backward path is
ρ−(x1, ..., xn) = p(x1|x2)p(x2|x3)...p(xn−1|xn)ρ(xn),
(24)
and dP−= ρ−Dx. The relative entropy of forward path
probability to the backward path probability, i.e., the
Kullback–Leibler divergence, is
H(ρ+∥ρ−) =
Z
dP+ln(dP+
dP−
) =
Z
ρ+ln(ρ+
ρ−
)Dx.
(25)
Similarly,
H(ρ−∥ρ+) =
Z
dP−ln(dP−
dP+
) =
Z
ρ−ln(ρ−
ρ+
)Dx.
(26)
The following theorem gives explicit expression of the
relative entropy.
3 In the equation, we suppress the time variable t1, t2, ..., tn with-
out lost of clarity since the subscript index i also serves as param-
eter showing the sequence of time. Thus, the transition proba-
bility p(xi|xi−1) should be understood as the standard notation
of p(xi, ti|xi−1, ti−1).
This notation convention will be used
throughout the paper.
Theorem 1 For a Markov diﬀusion process ξ(t) from
ta →tb, the relative entropy can be written as
H(ρ+∥ρ−) = Hb −Ha +
Z tb
ta
E[D+ln(ρ(ξ(t))]dt
H(ρ−∥ρ+) = Ha −Hb −
Z tb
ta
E[D−ln(ρ(ξ(t))]dt,
(27)
where ρ(x(t)) is the probability density at x(t), and
Ha = −
Z
ρ(xa)ln(ρ(xa))dxa,
Hb = −
Z
ρ(xb)ln(ρ(xb))dxb.
(28)
Applying (7) to (27) leads to Corollary 1.1.
Corollary 1.1 An alternative expression of the relative
entropy is
H(ρ+∥ρ−) = Hb −Ha −1
2
Z tb
ta
E[∇i(bi
+ + bi
−)]dt
H(ρ−∥ρ+) = Ha −Hb + 1
2
Z tb
ta
E[∇i(bi
+ + bi
−)]dt.
(29)
Proof of the Theorem and the Corollary is given
in Appendix A. One can immediately observe that
H(ρ+∥ρ−) = −H(ρ−∥ρ+). Then, by the non-negativity
property of relative entropy44, we have
Corollary 1.2 H(ρ+∥ρ−) = H(ρ−∥ρ+) = 0.
Since H(ρ+∥ρ−) = 0 if and only if ρ+ = ρ−, the two path
probability densities are the same, which is consistent
with the results in Ref.11.
Corollary 1.2 gives two constraints in terms of relative
entropy. These two constraints in fact are the same as
the transport equations17. The signiﬁcance of Corollary
1.2 is that we recognize them as relative entropy. It says
that the information encoded in the forward path con-
ﬁguration and backward path conﬁguration is identical.
The dynamics of the Brownian motion needs to comply to
this constraint. If we deﬁne the total relative entropy as
Hrel = H(ρ+∥ρ−) + H(ρ−∥ρ+), by Theorem 1, Hrel = 0
and doesn’t result in a constraint. We will next see how
these constraints play important roles in the stochastic
variation.
B.
Variations with Relative Entropy Constraint
In this subsection, we will show how the dynamic equa-
tions for the forward and backward mean velocities are
derived through variational method.
From them the
Schr¨odinger equation is recovered.
The Yasue version of Lagrangian (20) already suggests
we can split it into two parts, forward and backward La-

Then, LY deﬁned in (20) is LY = (L+

(31)
where E[·] denotes the absolute expectation along the

In Appendix B, we show that for a

and E[·] denotes the absolute expectation at time t. Now
we combine the forward and backward actions with the
constraints in Corollary 1.2 by deﬁning the Lagrangian
functional
J+
ab = A+
ab −βH(ρ+∥ρ−),
J−
ab = A−
ab −βH(ρ−∥ρ+),
(33)
where β is a Lagrangian multiplier. The deﬁnition of La-
grangian functional means that we seek to minimize the
forward and backward actions with the relative entropy
constraints. Substitute (29) and (30) into (33),
J+
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[1
2m(b+)ibi
+ −φ(ξ) + β
2 ∇i(bi
+ + bi
−)]dt
−β(Hb −Ha).
(34)
Next we apply the stochastic calculus described in Sec-
tion II B. Suppose we variate the diﬀusion process ξ(t)
to be ξ′(t) = ξ(t) + z(t) with z(ta) = z(tb) = 0, and de-
mands that δJ+
ab = o(∥z∥). Substituting (34) into (16),
and notice that Ha and Hb are ﬁxed values, we have
δJ+
ab =

E[δL+

E[∇i(δbi

=
Z tb
ta
E[m(b+)iδbi
+ −(∇iφ)zi + β
2 ∇i(δbi
+ + δbi
−)]dt
(35)
To proceed further, we need the following identity that is
derived from integration by part. Let f a smooth vector
function of the diﬀusion process,
E[∇if i] =
Z
ρ∇if idx = −
Z
(∇iρ)f idx
= −E[(∇iln(ρ))f i] = −1
ν E[uif i].
(36)
Let f i = δbi
+, we have E[∇iδbi
+] = −E[δbi
+∇iln(ρ)].
Substituting it into (35), and replacing δbi
+ = D+zi,

7
δbi
−= D−zi (see proof in Appendix C), we get
δJ+
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[m(b+)iδbi

=
Z tb
ta
E[m(b+)iD+zi −(∇iφ)zi
−β
2 (D+zi + D−zi)∇iln(ρ)]dt
.
(37)
Applying (17) to (37), we obtain
δJ+
ab = −
Z tb
ta
E[{mD−bi
++∇iφ−β
2 (D++D−)∇iln(ρ)}zi]dt.
(38)
Since zi(t) is arbitrary diﬀusion process, δJ+
ab = 0 if and
only if
mD−bi
+ + ∇iφ −β
2 (D+ + D−)∇iln(ρ) = 0.
(39)
This is the PDE for the dynamics derived from the for-
ward path. Repeat the same variational method on J−
ab,
we obtain the PDE for the dynamics of the backward
path,
mD+bi
−+ ∇iφ + β
2 (D+ + D−)∇iln(ρ) = 0.
(40)
(39) + (40) results in mD−bi
+ + mD+bi
−+ 2∇iφ = 0
which is the same as (21) and leads to Nelson’s second
equation (11). (39) - (40) gives
mD−bi
+ −mD+bi
−= β(D+ + D−)∇iln(ρ).
(41)
In Appendix D, we prove that if β = ℏ, (41) is the same
as Nelson’s ﬁrst equation (9). Note that Nelson’s equa-
tions are written in terms of time dynamics of vi and ui.
Here however, using (7) and (5), we can express the time
dynamics equation (40) in terms of bi
± as following,
∂bi
+
∂t =1
2[−(bj
+∇j + bj
−∇j)bi
+ −(bj

(42)
Similarly the time dynamics of backward mean velocity
is derived from (39) as
∂bi
−
∂t =1
2[(bj

−∇j)bi
+ −(bj
+∇j

−] + ℏ
2m∆bi
+ −∇iφ
m .
(43)
In summary, (39) and (40), or equivalently, (42) and (43),
recover Nelson’s theory.
From them, the Schr¨odinger
equation (12) can be derived through the similar set
of mathematical transformations ∇iR =
m
2ℏ(bi
+ −bi
−),
∇iS = m
2ℏ(bi
+ + bi
−), and ψ = eR+iS.
The variational method presented here can be consid-
ered as an extension of Yasue’s variational method12. In
fact, Yasue’s variational method is a special case if we de-
ﬁne total Lagrangian functional as Jab = (J+
ab +J−
ab)/2 =
R
E[LY ]dt + βHrel. But the total relative entropy Hrel
gives no constraint as mentioned in Section III A. This
is why there is no constraint term in Yasue’s variational
method.
It is worth to note in our derivation of Nelson’s equa-
tions, and consequently, the Schr¨odinger equation, we
only rely on a limited number of deﬁnitions and assump-
tions.
Speciﬁcally, there are three key deﬁnitions: 1.)
The deﬁnitions of forward and backward derivatives (2),
and forward and backward mean velocities; 2.) The iden-
tity (7), which in turn is derived from deﬁnitions of for-
ward and backward mean velocities and Bayes’ Theorem;
3.) Deﬁnition of Lagrangian L±
Y for both forward and
backward path conﬁgurations. The important assump-
tions include: 1.) The system is constantly performing
Markov diﬀusion; 2.) The variation principle of extrem-
izing the action with constraints on relative entropy; 3.)
The Lagrangian multiplier β is set to be the Planck con-
stant ℏ. The third assumption is non-trivial and is an
important feature of stochastic mechanics. Its possible
justiﬁcation has been discussed in Ref.33,34. The rest of
the deﬁnitions and assumptions can be naturally under-
stood from classical physics and probability theory. The
fact that the Schr¨odinger equation can be derived from
this limited list of deﬁnitions and assumptions is strik-
ing. It manifests the original goal of stochastic mechanics
to explain quantum mechanics from classical physics and
principles as much as possible4
In addition, the variation method presented here gives
richer physics since it derives PDEs for both forward
and backward path conﬁgurations. The relative entropy
constraint requires that the information encoded on the
forward and backward path conﬁguration is identical,
indicating some kinds of information symmetry.
The
methodological implication of our approach will be dis-
cussed further in Section IV. Another interesting feature
here is that there is no need to depend on the forward and
backward Fokker-Planck equations, which are needed in
Nelson’s original derivation10, and earlier variation ap-
proaches12,17–19 in order to derive the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion. To the contrary, in our variational approach, one
can actually derive the Fokker-Planck equations from
(41) and (7), as shown in Appendix D.
4 It is likely that the list of deﬁnitions and assumptions needs to
be expanded in order to recover other parts of quantum theory
such as quantum measurement or quantum entanglement. These
are future research topics.

C.
Variations with Fisher Information
Now we turn to the question on why the Guerra ver-
sion of Lagrangian (22) can also lead to the same Nelson
theory. We wish to derive the theory using the variation
method similar to that in Section III B, i.e., through a
functional that combines both action and certain infor-
mation measure of the diﬀusion process.
Clearly such
information measure cannot be the relative entropy, so
our ﬁrst step is to search what the suitable information
measure might be. It turns out that the answer is related
to Fisher information.
Traditionally, Fisher information is deﬁned to measure
the amount of information that an probability distribu-
tion of random variable x carries about an observable
parameter θ. Let f(x, θ) the probability density function
for x conditioned on θ, the Fisher information is deﬁned
as29
I(θ) =
Z
( ∂
∂θf(x, θ))2f(x, θ)dx.
(44)
If we are interested in the Fisher information about the
observable of position for a probability density function,
we can set the parameter θ as the position variable itself,
i.e., let θ = xi and f(x, θ) = ρ(x), the Fisher information
can be rewritten as30,31
I =
Z
ρ(x)(∇lnρ(x))2dx = E[(∇lnρ(ξ))2]
(45)
Since ∇lnρ = u/ν and ν = ℏ/2m, I can be rewritten as5
I(ξ) = E[uiui]/ν2.
(46)
We further deﬁne the Fisher information production
along the diﬀusion path ξ(t) from ta to tb as
Iab =
Z tb
ta
νI(ξ(t))dt = 1
ν
Z tb
ta
E[uiui]dt.
(47)
Constant ν is multiplied to I so that Iab is dimensionless.
With help of Theorem 1, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 2 For a Markov diﬀusion process ξ(t) from
ta →tb, the Fisher information production can be written
as
I+
ab = Hb −Ha −
Z tb
ta
E[∇ibi
+]dt,
I−
ab = Ha −Hb +
Z tb
ta
E[∇ibi
−]dt,
(48)
5 It is worth to note that the Fisher information deﬁned here
is also related to the Bohm quantum potential.
Let Q =
−ℏ2∆i∆i√ρ/(2m√ρ) be the Bohm quantum potential, it can be
shown that32 E[Q] = ℏ2I/(8m). Bohm potential is considered
to be nonlocal. The non-locality issue of stochastic mechanics is
further discussed in Section IV.D.
Proof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix E.
The Guerra and Morato version of Lagrangian are
given as17
L+
G(ξ, b+) = 1
2m(b+)ibi
+ + ℏ
2∇ibi
+ −φ(ξ)
L−
G(ξ, b−) = 1
2m(b−)ibi
−−ℏ
2∇ibi
−−φ(ξ).
(49)
The corresponding actions can be deﬁned as
A+
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[L+
G(ξ, b+)]dt
A−
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[L−
G(ξ, b−)]dt.
(50)
However,
it
is
veriﬁed11
that
E[L+
G(ξ, b+)]
=
E[L−
G(ξ, b−)] = E[ 1
2mvivi −1
2muiui −φ(ξ)]. Thus the
two expressions in (50) are equivalent.
Furthermore,
one can observe that the diﬀerence between A+
ab, deﬁned
in (50), and A+
ab, deﬁned in (31), is a term related to
R E[∇ibi
+]dt. This indicates that the diﬀerence is related
to the Fisher information production I+
ab. Thus, instead
of minimizing the actions, we seek to minimize the ac-
tions and Fisher information production together, with
the same relative entropy constraints. With this consid-
eration, we deﬁne the Lagrangian functional as
J +
ab = (A+
ab + αI+
ab) −βH(ρ+∥ρ−)
J −
ab = (A−
ab + αI−
ab) −βH(ρ−∥ρ+)
(51)
where β is the Lagrangian multiplier. Here, we seek to
minimize the combination of actions and Fisher informa-
tion production with the relative entropy constraints for
both forward and backward paths, respectively. Substi-
tuting (29), (48), (50) into (51), we have
J +
ab =
Z tb

E[1
2m(b+)ibi
+ −φ(ξ) + (ℏ
2 −α)∇ibi

+ β
2 ∇i(bi

−)]dt + (α −β)(Hb −Ha).
(52)
The Lagrangian multiplier has been set as β = ℏin Sec-
tion III B. Let α = ℏ/2, J +
ab is simpliﬁed to6
J +
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[1
2m(b+)ibi
+ −φ(ξ)

2∇i(bi

−)]dt −ℏ
2(Hb −Ha).
(53)
J +
ab is diﬀerent from J+
ab only by a constant term ℏ
2(Hb −
Ha). Applied the stochastic calculus described in Section
6 As the case of setting β = ℏ, the assumption of is α = ℏ/2 also
non-trivial. Its possible justiﬁcation has been discussed in Ref.
[29, 30].

II B by varying the diﬀusion process ξ(t) to be ξ(t) +
z(t) with z(ta) = z(tb) = 0, the variation of J +
ab can be
calculated as
δJ +
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[m(b+)iδbi
+ −∇iφzi + ℏ
2∇i(δbi
+ + δbi
−)]dt.
(54)
Comparing (54) to (35), we see δJ +
ab is the same as δJ+
ab.
The subsequent calculations for (37)-(38) are applicable
here, and resulting the same PDE (39) for the dynam-
ics of the forward path.
Similarly, one can derive the
expression for J −
ab
J −
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[1
2m(b−)ibi
−−φ(ξ)
−ℏ
2∇i(bi

−)]dt + ℏ
2(Hb −Ha).
(55)
Again, J −
ab is diﬀerent from J−
ab only by a constant ℏ
2(Hb−
Ha). Variations on both functional give the same PDE
(40) for the backward path. Thus, even though J ±
ab and
J±
ab are deﬁned quite diﬀerently, the variations over both
Lagrangian functional converge to the same outcomes.
Essentially, compared to L±
Y , the Guerra and Morato
version of Lagrangian L±
G includes a term related to
Fisher information production.
We deﬁne the corre-
sponding Lagrangian functional J ±
ab by reversing the ef-
fect of this term.
Then, applying the same variation
method with the relative entropy constraint, we can also
recover Nelson’s theory.
D.
Eﬀective Lagrangian
If both Lagrangians L±
Y , deﬁned in (30), and L±
G, de-
ﬁned in (49), can lead to the same PDEs for the forward
and backward paths, one may ask why there can be mul-
tiple choices of Lagrangian for the same physical process.
In classical mechanics, one typically writes down the ki-
netic energy K and deﬁne Lagrangian as L = K−φ where
φ is the potential energy. But in stochastic mechanics,
there is no ﬁrst principle that can guide the deﬁnition of
Kinetic energy, since there are multiple variables related
to velocity.
Further complication is that the Lagrangian functional
in the variation method consists the action, which is a
functional of the Lagrangian, and the relevant constraints
from information measures. Technically once can choose
an eﬀective Lagrangian that factors in the constraints, as
long as the variation on the Lagrangian functional with-
out the constraint gives the desired dynamics PDEs. For
instance, deﬁne
L+
E = 1
2m(b+)ibi
+ + ℏ
2∇i(bi
+ + bi
−) −φ
L−
E = 1
2m(b−)ibi
−−ℏ
2∇i(bi
+ + bi
−) −φ.
(56)
The corresponding actions are
A+
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[L+
E]dt
A−
ab =
Z tb
ta
E[L−
E]dt.
(57)
Then, by applying the same variational method in pre-
vious section to minimize the actions A±
ab without any
other constraints, one can obtain the same PDEs as (39)
and (40).
Table 1 summaries that for the three sets of La-
grangian, one can apply the variation calculus to de-
rive the same Nelson’s theory by combining with correct
choices of Fisher information production and (or) relative
entropy constraint.
By taking the absolute expectation of these three forms
of Lagrangian, we may obtain additional insight.
Re-
called that LY
= (L+
Y + L−
Y )/2, one can verify that
LY = 1
2mvivi + 1
2muiui −φ. Using identity (36), we can
express the expectations of the three forms of Lagrangian
in terms of LY , v and u,
E[L±
Y ] = E[LY ± mviui]
E[L±
G] = E[LY −muiui]
E[L±
E] = E[LY ].
(58)
Yasue’s initial variational approach using LY ] as the La-
grangian does not require constraint12. (58) shows that
E[L±
E] = E[LY ]. Chosen this form of Lagrangian, the
variational method does not require constraint to de-
rive the Nelson theory, consistent with Yasue’s approach.
However, using L±
E as the Lagrangian gives the advan-
tage of distinguishing the dynamics of forward and back-
ward path conﬁgurations, which is missing in Yasue’s
approach. The diﬀerence between E[L±
Y ] and E[L±
E] is
the term E[viui], which is related to the rate of en-
tropy production. Thus, to use L±
Y as the Lagrangian,
the relative entropy constraint is introduced in the varia-
tional method. On the other hand, the diﬀerence between
E[L±
G] and E[L±
E] is the term E[uiui], which is related to
Fisher information.
Therefore, the Fisher information
production is needed in the Lagrangian functional.
IV.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
A.
Degrees of Freedom
In previous sections, we recast the theory of stochastic
mechanics into two PDEs for forward and backward path
conﬁguration using the variation approach that com-
bines the least action principle and information measure
constraints. What are the physical implications of this
derivation? The concept of forward and backward paths
gives a physical picture when considering the dynamics
of a diﬀusing particle in stochastic mechanics. Recalled

FIG. 2: (a) In classical mechanics, a point particle moves from point a to point b with a path conﬁguration γab determined
by least action principle. (b) In stochastic mechanics, diﬀusion of a point particle is described with forward and backward
path conﬁgurations γ±
ab. Each path conﬁguration follows its own stochastic diﬀerential equation, but connected through the
relative entropy constraint. Combing the two PDEs results in the Schr¨odinger equation. (c) Conjecture: By introducing
rotational degrees of freedom σ±, there are four path conﬁgurations γi in the phase spaces Γi (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). Can the
variation approach developed here lead to the Dirac equation for spin once it is extended into the relativistic framework?
that the term forward or backward does not refer to the
direction of time. Instead, it just refers to the path con-
ﬁguration γ±
ab that are described by either the forward
mean velocity and backward mean velocity, respectively.
This implies that extra degrees of freedom are needed to
completely describe the dynamics of the system. For the
time being we assume the system under study is a point
particle in a three-dimension space. As mentioned ear-
lier, we can envision the phase space Γ : {(x, b+, b−)}
comprises two classical phase subspaces Γ+ : {(x, b+)}
and Γ−: {(x, b−)}, as shown in Fig.2b.
Path conﬁg-
urations γ±
ab follow their own dynamics in Γ±, respec-
tively. But they are connected by the relative entropy
constraint. The overall dynamics is described by the La-
grangian functional deﬁned in (33). Applying the vari-
ation method gives (39) for forward path conﬁguration,
and (40) for backward path conﬁguration.
The Schr¨odinger equation essentially combines two
non-linear PDEs into a linear PDE through mathemati-
cal transformation. In this perspective, the wave function
in quantum mechanics is just a mathematical tool that
makes the calculation much easier.
But the underline
physics is stochastic mechanics that essentially demands
extra degree of freedom to completely describe a diﬀusing
point particle.
By replacing the classical velocity with forward and
backward mean velocity, one obtains two PDEs that leads
to the Schr¨odinger equation. We may naturally ask if this
approach can be further extended. Although the assump-
tion that the system is a point particle with both forward
and backward mean velocity is a step forward compared
to describing the system as a classical point particle with
a single velocity, it is still an over simpliﬁcation. Sup-
pose we add two new degrees of freedom, σ+ and σ−, to
describe the rotation of the system clockwise and coun-
terclockwise, respectively. The total phase conﬁguration
is expanded to be Γ : {(x, b+, b−, σ+, σ−)}. In a sim-
ilar way, we envision the phase space Γ comprises four
classical phase subspaces Γ1 : {(x, b+)}, Γ2 : {(x, b−)},
Γ3 : {(x, σ+)}, and Γ4 : {(x, σ+)}, as shown in Fig.2c.
There are four path conﬁgurations γi(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) in
these phase subspaces. We would expect that more con-
straints will be imposed, and the variational method can
still be applied to give four PDEs, one for each path
conﬁguration. Will this lead to, or recover, the more ad-
vanced quantum theory, possibly the Dirac equation for
spin? To this end, one will need to ﬁrst construct a rel-
ativistic stochastic mechanics24–26, and also extend the
variational approach in a relativistic setting. This is an
interesting conjecture for future research.

11
Furthermore, other degrees of freedom can be added
for a more sophisticated physical modeling of a quantum
system.
B.
Probability for Indistinguishable Alternatives
The constraint of zero relative entropy we impose in
the variation principle essentially requires that the prob-
abilities for both forward and backward paths are identi-
cal, i.e., ρ+ = ρ−. By measuring the probability of a par-
ticle diﬀuses from point a to point b, one cannot tell the
underline paths are forward or backward paths. In other
words, we can view the two path conﬁgurations as indis-
tinguishable alternatives that are needed to complete the
description of the diﬀusion dynamics. It is not clear if it
is even possible to design an experiment to distinguish
the two path conﬁgurations. But is clear that without a
speciﬁc measurement, the forward and backward paths
cannot be distinguishable. They are not exclusive alter-
natives.
Such similar idea was proposed in the Feynman
path integral formulation of quantum mechanics40.
In
path integral, a particle can move from point a to
point b through inﬁnite number of alternative paths.
These paths are indistinguishable but they should be all
counted in order to have a complete description of the
quantum behavior of the particle. The law for comput-
ing the probability of the particle moving from point a
to point b is not just to simply add up the probability of
each path. Instead, one adds up the probability ampli-
tude for each path ﬁrst, then takes the modulus square of
the summation. According to Feynman40,41, the law of
computing the probability is diﬀerent from classical law
because the alternatives are interfering alternatives, in-
stead of exclusive alternative. The concept of interfering
alternatives is unique to quantum mechanics.
In our formulation, there is no concept of probability
amplitude. Thus, we cannot straightforwardly use the
same law of calculating the probability as that in path
integral. But there is still similarity in that the forward
and backward paths are non-exclusive alternatives. The
two paths interfere each other, as shown by the two PDEs
(39) and (40). The probability of a particle diﬀuses from
point a to point b is not simply the sum of the prob-
abilities of each path. The characteristic of interfering
alternative that is unique to quantum mechanics is man-
ifested here, but in the context of stochastic process.
C.
Physical Variable versus Information Measure
As pointed out in Section III D, using the same stochas-
tic calculus of variation, one can derive the Nelson the-
ory, thus the Schr¨odinger equation, from three diﬀerent
forms of Lagrangian. The action derived from each form
of Lagrangian needs to be combined with appropriate
constraints related to information measures in the varia-
tional method. Eﬀectively, one can just construct a La-
grangian without being aware of the corresponding con-
straint, as long as the eﬀective Lagrangian leads to the
correct form of Euler-Lagrangian equation. This is pos-
sible because there is no clear principle to guide the con-
struction the correct Lagrangian, and some of the con-
straints may not be obvious to recognize. This is the case
for L±
E. The terms in the Lagrangian come from proper
choice of physical variables, such as kinetic energy and
potential energy, or can come from information measure
such as entropy production rate and Fisher information.
In the case of stochastic mechanics, the Planck constant
appears to be the Lagrangian multiplier that converts
an information measure related term to act like physical
variable term in the variation process.
In both classical and quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT), the
ﬁrst step of developing a ﬁeld theory is to construct a
proper Lagrangian density. This important ﬁrst step is
a creative one, allowing trial and error. As long as the
Lagrangian density leads to the correct form of Euler-
Lagrangian equation, it is accepted as an appropriate
form. Many complicated Lagrangian density functions
constructed in QFT comprise many terms, and some of
the terms are introduced intuitively.
If we extend the
variation principle developed here for stochastic mechan-
ics to ﬁeld theory, we can reasonably ask the following
question for future investigation: From stochastic me-
chanics perspective, are some of the terms in the La-
grangian density functions in classical or quantum ﬁeld
theory actually reﬂect certain information related con-
straints?
At the philosophical level, the structure of Lagrangian
developed here implies that a physical theory can em-
brace both ontological component and epistemic compo-
nent. A physical theory essentially describes how well
a physical phenomenon can be observed. Such observa-
tion echoes the ideas brought up by other authors previ-
ously27,28.
D.
Comparison with the Earlier Variational Methods
The variational principle presented here utilizes the
stochastic calculus of variations from Yasue12 and signiﬁ-
cantly extends Yasue’s results. In particular, we are able
to derive the PDEs for both forward and backward paths.
Yasue’s derivation is just a special case in our formula-
tion. Guerra and Morato17 proposed a diﬀerent variation
approach where the end point of the path varies. Again,
they do not derive diﬀerent PDEs for forward and back-
ward path. Both Yasue and Guerra variation approaches
do not involve information measures compared to our ap-
proach.
Ref.18 introduces a saddle-point entropy production
principle, where one seeks to extremize the entropy pro-
duction in the diﬀusion process with a constraint that
essentially comes from the Fokker-Planck equation. In
this works, we recognize the equation on the entropy pro-

12
duction is actually a constraint on the relative entropy in
the path space, and no need to depend on Fokker-Planck
equation. Our approach is more intuitive and more im-
portantly, we are able to derive PDEs for both forward
and backward path, which is not shown in Ref.18.
A more recent development of variation based entropic
dynamics is described in Ref.19, where the probability
distribution is derived from a variation of relative en-
tropy. Such probability distribution implies a trajectory
of Brownian motion. Then, variation based on princi-
ple of conservation of energy, together with the Fokker-
Planck equation, gives the Schr¨odinger equation. This
approach requires two variation processes, and does not
give the dynamics of both forward and backward paths.
Furthermore, the relative entropy deﬁned in Ref.19 is
very diﬀerent from the relative entropy in the present
works.
The method of variation with relative entropy
was investigated in many other contexts. For instance,
the original Schr¨odinger Bridge Problem was later refor-
mulated to be a problem of minimizing relative entropy6,
which leads to connection to the mass transportation the-
ory8. In such reformulation, the relative entropy is de-
ﬁned on the bridging path probability measure relative
to a reference path probability measure. Variation over
the dynamic probability measure to minimize the relative
entropy gives to the solution of the Schr¨odinger Bridge
Problem8. However, the way relative entropy is used in
our formulation is very diﬀerent. Here, the relative en-
tropy is deﬁned based on probability densities for both
forward and backward path conﬁgurations, and used as
a constraint in the least action principle.
Variation on the combination of action and Fisher in-
formation production to derive the Schr¨odinger equation
was also studied in Refs.30,31. However, the derivation
was primarily mathematical rather than based on a phys-
ical dynamics model such as Brownian motion.
Thus,
it did not provide the dynamics of both forward and
backward paths. However, the justiﬁcations in Ref.31 for
choosing Fisher information in their variational method
maybe well applicable in the stochastic variational ap-
proach here.
In summary, the novelty of the variational method pro-
posed here comes from its capability of deriving PDEs
from both forward and backward paths, and the fruit-
ful interplay between actions and information measures
in the Lagrangian functional. These results enhance our
understanding of stochastic mechanics.
E.
Limitations
The rigorousness of the derivation presented here de-
pends on the stochastic calculus described by Yahsue12.
Thus, it is only as rigorous as the stochastic calculus
can be. One limitation to point out is the calculation in
(16). There the variation of Jab is calculated as Jab =
E
R
L(ξ+z)dt−E
R
L(ξ)dt = E
R
(L(ξ+z)−L(ξ))dt. Es-
sentially it assumes that the variation due to the change
of probability density along the path is negligible com-
pared to the variation due to the change of integrand, so
that the expectation operators are considered the same.
A rigorous treatment to conﬁrm this is desirable, even
though this stochastic calculus has been successfully ap-
plied to derive Nelson’s theory, Noether’s theorem12, the
results in the present works, and in many other applica-
tions14–16.
The origin of randomness of the diﬀusion process is
not investigated here. One explanation is that the space
metric tensor itself given stochastically with some appro-
priate distribution function21. A point particle in such
stochastic metric space is described as Brownian motion.
However, modeling a system as a point particle is an over
simpliﬁcation. As mentioned earlier, an intuitive exten-
sion is to introduce rotational degree of freedom into the
variation, and investigate what new physical dynamics
can be derived.
In addition, our construction here is
limited to Markov diﬀusion process. The connection be-
tween quantum mechanics and a more generalized recip-
rocal stochastic process called Bernstein-Markov process
was investigated in Ref.14, which conﬁrms not only the
connection between Bernstein process and Nelson’s the-
ory, but also the connection between Bernstein process
and the imaginary time version of Schr¨odinger equation.
Whether the variational principle proposed in the present
work can be applied to Bernstein reciprocal process is an
interesting topic for further research.
The stochastic mechanics has its own limitation to
explain the locality problem.
Nelson has described a
scenario11 that the behavior of a particle described by
Markovian stochastic mechanics depends on the process
on a second particle that is uncoupled and separated ar-
bitrary away.
Such scenario leads him to believe that
stochastic mechanism is not a tenable physical theory to
reﬂect reality11. However, it is not clear whether stochas-
tic mechanics should be regarded as a “non-local” hid-
den variable theory that violates the Bell inequalities.
Recent investigation shows that the derivation of Bell
inequalities depends on three assumptions: outcome in-
dependence, statistical locality, and measurement inde-
pendence45.
Violation of Bell inequalities just means
at least one of the three assumptions does not hold.
The violation does not necessarily imply the theory is
non-local. Instead it means the statistical correlation is
non-separable46. The non-locality issue that Nelson con-
cerned on stochastic mechanics may well be due to the
similar non-separability of statistical correlation that ex-
hibits in the quantum correlation through entanglement.
There are other opened questions on how stochastic
mechanics can explain quantum phenomena, readers are
referred to the well known review papers3,4 and a most
recent recent paper26. One of the subtleties is that to
what extend stochastic mechanics can rely on the clas-
sical probability theory to explain quantum mechanics
speciﬁc phenomena.
For instance, multi-time correla-
tions cannot be straightforwardly calculated using clas-
sically probability theory since it predicts diﬀerent re-

13
sults from quantum mechanics42. Instead, to obtain the
correct multi-time correlations, one should take account
into consideration that after a measurement, the diﬀusion
process is reset43.
The challenges and limitations mentioned in this sub-
section will continue to inspire future researches to bring
new physical insights into stochastic mechanics.
The
present works does not intend to address these opened
issues in stochastic mechanics. But we believe the vari-
ational principle described here gives new insight that
stochastic mechanics is coupled with information mea-
sure constraint such as Fisher information that may give
rise to the property of non-separability.
Therefore, it
might explain the locality issue and entanglement phe-
nomenon. This is currently under further investigation.

Conclusions
A new variational principle is proposed here to de-
rive the dynamics equations for the forward and back-
ward paths, which when combined together, result in
the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger equation. According to
this principle, appropriate Lagrangian must be chosen,
together with constraints that are related to informa-
tion measure such as relative entropy or Fisher informa-
tion. The derivation method is based on the stochastic
calculus. We show three diﬀerent forms of Lagrangian
can lead to the same Nelson theory. The advantages of
this variational principle compared to others are clearly
shown from its ability to resolve the issue of multiple La-
grangians, and the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equa-
tion as a side outcome instead of dependent on it when
deriving the Sch¨odinger equation.
The variational principle developed in this work not
only mathematically recovers the Nelson stochastic me-
chanics and the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger equation,
but also brings new insights on the underlined physics.
First,, the concept of forward and back paths provides a
intuitive physical picture to consider the dynamics of a
diﬀusing particle. It gives more insight on the diﬀerence
between classical and quantum mechanics in terms of de-
gree of freedom needed to describe a system completely.
Methodologically, one can include new degrees of freedom
to expand the theory to derive more advanced theory. It
is natural to conjecture that this idea can be potentially
generalized to derive the Dirac equation if rotational de-
grees of freedom are included in the stochastic variation.
The constraint of zero relative entropy imposed to the
least action principle shows that the forward and back-
ward paths, although both are needed for a complete
description of a diﬀusing particle, are indistinguishable
through measurement. This echoes the idea of interfer-
ing alternative proposed in the path integral formulation
of quantum mechanics. Finally, when constructing a La-
grangian, it is subtle to distinguish terms coming from
physical variables such as kinetic energy and potential
energy or from constraints on certain information mea-
sure such as relative entropy and Fisher information. It
is intuitive to speculate that if the stochastic mechanics
is extended to ﬁeld theory, some of the Lagrangian terms
in the ﬁeld theory may turn out to actually reﬂect certain
information constraints.

(A3)
T1 is simpliﬁed as

In the last step, we take ∆t →0. Substituting (A4) and
(A6) back to (A1), we ﬁnally obtain
H(ρ+∥ρ−) = Hb −Ha +

E[D+lnρ(ξ(t))]dt.
(A7)
Derivation of H(ρ−∥ρ+) follows similar steps, except we
need to use the deﬁnition of backward derivative in (2).
Setting xn = xb, x1 = xa gives (27) in Theorem 1.
To prove (29), one expands D+ln(ρ) in (A6) using (5),
T2 =

(A9)
Rewriting the second in (A8) using (7), i.e., ui = ν∇ilnρ,
one gets E[bi
+∇ilnρ] = 1
ν E[bi
+ui]. Let f i = bi
+ in (36),
one obtains 1
ν E[bi
+ui] = −E[∇ibi
+]. Finally, for the third
term in (A8), E[ν∆ln(ρ)] = E[∇iui]. Substitute these
identities into (A8),
Z tb

E[D+ln(ρ)]dt =

E[∇i(bi

Substituting (A10) and (A11) into (27), we have (29).
Appendix B: Swapping order of taking expectation and
integration
In the deﬁnition of action in (31), E[·] is understood as
the absolute expectation along the path xa →xb. Given
the property of Markov process, the probability density
is deﬁned in (23). Thus,
A+
ab =

Y (xi, ti)dx1dx2...dxn.
(B1)
For each of the integration term in the summation over
i, we apply the identities (A3) to the integration over
dx1dx2...dxn except dxi, it ends up with
A+
ab =

(B2)
Here E[·] denotes the absolute expectation over the con-
ﬁguration at time t. Thus, the order of integration and
expectation can be swapped, as long as the meaning of
expectation is understood correctly. The same argument
goes for A−
ab.

Appendix C: Proof of δbi
+ = D+zi
First note that zi(t) = ξ′i(t) −ξi(t). By the deﬁnition
of derivative operator D+ in (2),
D+zi =
lim
dt→0+ Et[zi(t + dt) −zi(t)
dt
]
=
lim
dt→0+ Et[ξ′i(t + dt) −ξi(t + dt) −ξ′i(t) + ξi(t)
dt
]
=
lim
dt→0+ Et[ξ′i(t + dt) −ξ′i(t)
dt
−ξi(t + dt) −ξi(t)
dt
]
= D+ξ′i(t) −D+ξi(t).
(C1)
But D+ξ′i(t) = b′i
+(ξ′(t)) and D+ξi(t) = bi
+(ξ′(t)).
Therefore, D+zi = b′i
+(ξ′(t)) −bi
+(ξ(t)) = δbi
+. Similarly,
one can verify that D−zi = δbi
−.
Appendix D: Derivation of Nelson’s First Equation (9) and
Fokker-Planck Equations from (41)
Given β = ℏand (7), β∇iln(ρ) = 2mui. Applied (5)
to ui, the R.H.S of (41) becomes
R.H.S = 2m(2 ∂
∂t + (bj
+ + bj
−)∇j)ui
= 4m(∂ui
∂t + vj∇jui).
(D1)
Applied (5) to bi
±, the L.H.S of (41) becomes
L.H.S = m( ∂

−−2ν∆vi).
(D2)
Equating (D1) and (D2), after simple algebra, one gets
∂ui
∂t = −2vj∇jui + 1
2(bj
−∇jbi
+ −bj
+∇jbi
−) −ν∆vi
= −2vj∇jui + vj∇jui −uj∇jvi −ν∆vi
= −vj∇jui −uj∇jvi −ν∆vi.
(D3)
Since both ui and vi are gradients and the curl of a gra-
dient is zero, we have ∇jui = ∇iuj, ∇jvi = ∇ivj, so
that
∂ui
∂t = −vj∇iuj −uj∇ivj −ν∆vi
= −∇ivjuj −ν∆vi.
(D4)
This is the same equation as (9).
We further derive the Fokker-Planck equations from
(D4). To do this, note that ∆vi = ∇j∇jvi = ∇i∇jvj,
we rewrite the R.H.S of (D4) as −∇i(vjuj + ν∇jvj),
and since ui = ν∇ilnρ, the L.H.S. of (D4) is ∂ui/∂t =
ν∇i(∂lnρ/∂t). Thus,
∇i(ν ∂lnρ
∂t ) = −∇i(vjuj + ν∇jvj)
(D5)
This gives
ν ∂lnρ
∂t
= −viui −ν∇ivi
= −ν(∇ilnρ)vi −ν∇ivi
= −ν(∇iρ
ρ vi + ∇ivi)
(D6)
Multiplying ρ/ν to both sides gives the continuity equa-
tion of probability density
∂ρ
∂t = −∇i(viρ).
(D7)
Substituting vi = bi
+ −ui = bi
+ −ν∇ilnρ one gets the
forward Fokker-Planck equation
∂ρ
∂t = −∇i(bi
+ρ) + ν∆ρ.
(D8)
Substituting vi = bi
−+ ui = bi
−+ ν∇ilnρ one gets the
backward Fokker-Planck equation
∂ρ
∂t = −∇i(bi
−ρ) −ν∆ρ.
(D9)
Appendix E: Proof of Theorem 2
Let f i = ui in (36), we get
1
ν E[uiui] = −E[∇iui].
Substitute this into (47),
Iab = −
Z tb
ta
E[∇iui]dt.
(E1)
Since ui = bi
+ −vi,
Iab = −

E[∇ibi

E[∇ivi]dt
= −
Z tb
ta
E[∇ibi

2
Z tb
ta
E[∇i(bi
+ + bi

(E2)
From (29) in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1.1, the second
term equals H(xb) −H(xa). Therefore,
Iab = H(xb) −H(xa) −
Z tb
ta
E[∇ibi
+]dt.
(E3)
One can also substitute ui = vi −bi
−into (E1) and get
Iab =

E[∇ibi

Z tb

E[∇ivi]dt

E[∇ibi

(E4)

Both (E3) and (E4) are equivalent expression for the
Fisher information production, but we label Iab as I±
ab
in Theorem 2 to reﬂect the dependency on the forward
and backward mean velocity, respectively.
