STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND
RECOGNITION
MAI GEHRKE
Abstract. Our main result is that any topological algebra based on a Boolean
space is the extended Stone dual space of a certain associated Boolean algebra
with additional operations. A particular case of this result is that the proﬁnite
completion of any abstract algebra is the extended Stone dual space of the
Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the abstract algebra endowed with
certain residuation operations.
These results identify a connection between
topological algebra as applied in algebra and Stone duality as applied in logic,
and show that the notion of recognition originating in computer science is
intrinsic to proﬁnite completion in mathematics in general. This connection
underlies a number of recent results in automata theory including a general-
ization of Eilenberg-Reiterman theory for regular languages and a new notion
of compact recognition applying beyond the setting of regular languages. The
purpose of this paper is to give the underlying duality theoretic result in its
general form. Further we illustrate the power of the result by providing a few
applications in topological algebra and language theory. In particular, we give
a simple proof of the fact that any topological algebra quotient of a proﬁnite
algebra which is again based on a Boolean space is in fact a proﬁnite alge-
bra and we derive the conditions dual to the ones of the original Eilenberg
theorem in a fully modular manner. We cast our results in the setting of ex-
tended Priestley duality for distributive lattices with additional operations as
some classes of languages of interest in automata theory fail to be closed under
complementation.
1. Introduction
In 1936, M. H. Stone initiated duality theory in logic by presenting a dual cat-
egory equivalence between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of
compact Hausdorﬀspaces having a basis of clopen sets, so-called Boolean spaces
[53]. Stone’s duality and its variants are central in making the link between syn-
tactical and semantic approaches to logic. Also in theoretical computer science
this link is central as the two sides correspond to speciﬁcation languages and the
space of computational states. This ability to translate faithfully between algebraic
speciﬁcation and spatial dynamics has often proved itself to be a powerful theo-
retical tool as well as a handle for making practical problems decidable. One may
speciﬁcally mention Abramsky’s paper [1] linking program logic and domain theory
via Stone duality, Esakia’s duality [20] for Heyting algebras and the correspond-
ing frame semantics for intuitionistic logic, and Goldblatt’s paper [30] identifying
extended Stone duality as the setting for completeness issues for Kripke semantics

in modal logic. These applications need more than just basic Stone duality as the
ﬁrst requires Stone or Priestley duality for distributive lattices and the latter two
require a duality for Boolean algebras or distributive lattices endowed with addi-
tional operations. Dualities for additional operations originate with J´onsson and
Tarski [32, 33] and the ﬁrst purely duality theoretic account may be found in [30] in
the setting of Priestley duality. Stone or Priestley duality for Boolean algebras and
distributive lattices with various kinds of additional operations are often referred
to as extended duality.
Proﬁnite algebra goes back at least to the paper [8] of Garrett Birkhoﬀ, where he
introduces topologies deﬁned by congruences on abstract algebras observing that,
if each congruence has ﬁnite index, then the completion of the topological algebra
is compact. Proﬁnite topologies for free groups were subsequently explored by M.
Hall [31]. The proﬁnite approach has also been used to much proﬁt in semigroup
theory and in automata theory since the late 1980s, in particular by Almeida, who
developed the theory of so-called implicit operations [3]. The abstract approach
to formal languages and automata provided by proﬁnite algebra has lead to the
solution of very concrete problems in automata theory, like the ﬁltration problem
[5] and the characterization of languages recognized by reversible automata [39].
Recognizability is an original subject of computer science. Relying on automata,
the notion was ﬁrst introduced for ﬁnite words by Kleene [34], but was soon ex-
tended to inﬁnite words by B¨uchi [14], and then further to general algebras [37],
ﬁnite and inﬁnite trees [19, 56, 47], and to many other structures. New settings in
which recognition is a fruitful concept are still being developed, for example cost
functions [15] and data monoids [10]. The success of the concept of recognizability
has been greatly augmented by its combination with proﬁnite methods.
Our main result is a link between topological algebras based on Boolean spaces
and extended Stone duality, two distinct applications of topological methods in al-
gebra. In particular, we show that topological algebras based on Boolean spaces
are always themselves dual spaces of certain Boolean algebras with additional op-
erations. The bulk of the paper studies this connection in detail, identifying the
dual class of Boolean algebras with additional operations, the correspondence for
morphisms, and the generalization to Priestley topological algebras and their dis-
tributive lattice with additional operations duals. In the special case of the proﬁnite
completion of an algebra of any operational type, the dual Boolean algebra with
additional operations is the algebra of recognizable subsets of the original algebra
endowed with certain operations. This result makes clear that the use in tandem
of proﬁnite completions and recognizable subsets in automata theory is not acci-
dental. Since the two are duals of each other, the study of recognizable subsets is
natural, not just in automata theory and theoretical computer science, but in any
setting where proﬁnite completions occur and vice versa. The fact that the proﬁ-
nite completion of the free monoid on a ﬁnite set of generators is the dual space
of a Boolean algebra with additional operations based on the recognizable subsets
of the free monoid underlies a number of recent results in automata theory includ-
ing a generalization of Eilenberg-Reiterman theory for regular languages [25] and
a notion of compact recognition applying beyond the setting of regular languages
[26].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the required prelimi-
naries on duality theory. This material is not available in the needed form and with

a uniform presentation, so we go in some detail. We include the discrete duality
due essentially to Birkhoﬀas it underlies the topological one and is especially im-
portant for understanding additional operations. We describe the correspondences
across the discrete and topological dualities for homomorphisms, subalgebras, and
additional operations with some meet or join preservation properties. Section 3
contains the main results of the paper. We show that topological algebras over
Priestley spaces are dual spaces of certain distributive lattices with additional op-
erations, and we identify the special features of the objects on either side of the
duality. Finally we consider duality for maps. In particular, we identify the dual
notion to one topological algebra over a Priestley space being an (ordered) topolog-
ical algebra quotient of another. This gives rise to the notion of residuation ideal.
Proﬁnite algebras are particular topological algebras based on Boolean spaces. In
Section 4 we identify the lattices with additional operations dual to proﬁnite al-
gebras and use this characterization to prove that Boolean-topological quotients
of proﬁnite algebras are again proﬁnite. Then we specialize further and consider
those proﬁnite algebras which are proﬁnite completions. In particular we show that
the proﬁnite completion of any discrete abstract algebra is the dual space of the
Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the original abstract algebra equipped
with certain residuation operations. Our proof of this result uses the general results
of Section 3 and is more conceptually transparent than the one used in [25] (see also
Lemma 1 of [22]). Finally, we show how Eilenberg-Reiterman theory comes about
from the duality between sublattices and quotient spaces applied in this setting.
Most of the results of this paper as well as their proofs were ﬁrst discovered
using an algebraic approach to duality for lattices with additional operations know
as the theory of canonical extensions [27]. However, in order to make the paper
accessible to researchers only familiar with duality theory in its topological form, we
have chosen to present the results and their proofs without reference to canonical
extensions. This has the drawback that it is less transparent how we arrived at the
right notions and statements of results. For an outline of the canonical extension
approach to this material, see [22].
2. Preliminaries on duality
In this section we collect the basic facts about duality and extended duality that
we will need. We assume all lattices to be distributive and bounded with the least
element denoted by 0 and greatest element by 1.
2.1. Discrete duality. The starting point of the representation theory of distribu-
tive lattices is the classical theorem of Birkhoﬀfor ﬁnite distributive lattices. Also,
duality for additional operations in the inﬁnite topological setting is obtained by
adding topological requirements to the underlying discrete duality. For this reason
it is interesting to review here this discrete duality generalizing Birkhoﬀ.
An element p in a lattice is called join-irreducible provided p ̸= 0 and whenever
p = a ∨b, we have p = a or p = b.
Theorem 2.1 (Birkhoﬀ). Any ﬁnite distributive lattice D is isomorphic to the
lattice of down-sets of the partially ordered set of join-irreducible elements of D via
the asignment for a ∈D
a 7→ba := ↓a ∩J(D) = {p ∈D | p join-irreducible, p ⩽a}.

Birkhoﬀ’s duality generalizes to the category of complete lattices that are isomor-
phic to down-set lattices of posets. In the tradition of [32, 27], we call these DL+s.
These lattices have a number of diﬀerent abstract characterizations. They are the
completely distributive complete lattices in which every element is the supremum
of completely join-irreducible elements. Here, an element p in a complete lattice C
is called completely join-irreducible provided, p = W S with S ⊆C implies p ∈S
and we denote the set of all completely join-irreducible elements of C by J∞(C).
The DL+s are also the doubly algebraic distributive lattices, see e.g. [16, p. 83] for
an early textbook source. Finally, this class of lattices was also rediscovered in the
domain theory community where they are known as the prime algebraic distributive
lattices [38]. The Boolean members are the complete and atomic Boolean algebras,
often denoted in the literature as CABAs or BA+s.
Theorem 2.2. [48] Any DL+ is isomorphic to the lattice of down-sets of the
partially ordered set of its completely join-irreducible elements.
In particular, a
complete and atomic Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the powerset of its set of
atoms.
This correspondence between DL+s and posets extends to a categorical duality
in which complete lattice homomorphisms correspond to order-preserving maps.
The correspondence between complete homomorphisms h : C →C′ and order-
preserving maps ϕ : X′ →X is given by the following adjunction property for
x′ ∈X′ = J∞(C′) and u ∈C
ϕ(x′) ⩽u
⇐⇒
x′ ⩽h(u).
This works because h has a lower adjoint which maps completely join-irreducibles
to completely join-irreducibles and because h may be recovered from this map. For
further details, see Section 1.1 of [23].
Let C be a DL+ and X its poset of completely join irreducibles. Consider the
following relation R between elements a ∈C and pairs (x, x′) ∈X × X:
a R (x, x′)
⇐⇒
(x′ ⩽a ⇒x ⩽a).
From this relation we get a Galois connection [9] between the powersets of C and
X × X given by

Theorem 2.3. Let C be a DL+ and X its poset of completely join irreducibles.
Further, let E : P(C) ⇆P(X×X) : S be the above Galois connection. The Galois
closed sets are the complete sublattices of C and the quasi-orders on X extending
the partial order of X, respectively.
This is a poset theoretic generalization of the correspondence between complete
Boolean subalgebras of power sets and equivalence relations on the underlying sets.
In Section 2.3 we will derive most of the corresponding result of topological duality
(cf. Theorem 2.8).
An operation on a DL+, f : Cn →C, is a complete operator provided it preserves
arbitrary joins in each coordinate. For such an operation we have for each u ∈Cn
f(u) =
_
{f(x) | x ∈Xn with x ⩽u}

where X is the poset of completely join irreducible elements of C. Deﬁne Rf for
x ∈Xn and x ∈X, by
xRfx
⇐⇒
f(x) ⩾x.
One may observe that the relations thus obtained are order-compatible in the fol-
lowing sense.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let X be a poset and R ⊆Xn+1.
We say that R is order-
compatible provided for all x, x′ ∈Xn and all x, x′ ∈X, if x′ ⩾x and xRx and
x ⩾x′, then x′Rx′.
One obtains the following discrete duality theorem for complete operators.
Theorem 2.5. [33] Let C be a DL+ and X its poset of completely join irreducibles.
Discrete duality yields a one-to-one correspondence between the complete n-ary op-
erators on C and the order-compatible (n + 1)-ary relations on X. It is given by
f : Cn →C
7→
Rf = {(x, x) | x ⩽f(x)}
R ⊆Xn+1
7→
fR : D(X)n →D(X), with fR(U) = R[U1, . . . , Un, ]
where
R[U1, . . . , Un, ] = {x ∈X | ∃xi ∈Ui, i = 1, . . . , n, with (x1, . . . , xn, x) ∈R}.
It is well known that an operation on a complete lattice, f : Cn →C, is com-
pletely join-preserving in the ith coordinate if and only if it has an ith upper residual
f #
i
: Cn →C. That is, f and f #
i
are related by
∀a1, . . . , an, a ∈C

f(a1, . . . , an) ⩽a
⇐⇒
ai ⩽f #
i (a1, . . . , ai−1, ai+1, . . . , an, a)

.1
Also, these two maps uniquely determine each other and the fact that f #
i
has
a lower residual is equivalent to the fact that it turns arbitrary meets in the last
coordinate into meets. If, in addition, f is completely join preserving in each of
its other coordinates, then f #
i
also turns arbitrary joins in each of the ﬁrst n −1
coordinates into meets. The relation R dual to a complete operator f may also
be seen as the dual of the upper residuals of f. The ith residual is given on the
down-set lattice of X by
(U1, . . . , Ui−1, Ui+1, . . . , Un, U) 7→(R[U1, . . . , Ui−1,
, Ui+1, . . . , Un, U c])c
where ( )c stands for the set-theoretic complement.
For more details on residuation see Section 4 of [29]. The binary case is also
discussed further in Section 2.4 below.
2.2. Ideals and ﬁlters. The basic idea of lattice duality is to represent a lattice
by its set of join- and/or meet-irreducible elements. However, for inﬁnite lattices,
there aren’t necessarily enough of these, and idealized elements, in the form of
ideals or ﬁlters, and topology must be considered.
Let D be a bounded distributive lattice. A subset I of D is an ideal provided
it is a down-set closed under ﬁnite joins. We denote by Idl(D) the set of all ideals
of D partially ordered by inclusion. A subset F of D is a ﬁlter provided it is an
up-set closed under ﬁnite meets. Filters represent (possibly non-existing) inﬁma
and thus the order on ﬁlters is given by reverse inclusion. We denote by Filt(D)
1For binary operations with inﬁx notation, we denote the two upper residuals as right and left
division, see e.g. Section 2.4.

the partially ordered set of all ﬁlters of D. A proper ideal I is prime provided
a ∧b ∈I implies a ∈I or b ∈I. A proper ﬁlter F is prime provided a ∨b ∈F
implies a ∈F or b ∈F. Note that a ﬁlter is prime if and only if its complement is an
ideal, which is then necessarily prime, so that prime ﬁlters and prime ideals come in
complementary pairs. In particular this means that the set of prime ideals with the
inclusion order is isomorphic to the set of prime ﬁlters with the reverse inclusion
order. For a bounded distributive lattice D we will denote this partially ordered
set by XD or just X. Since there are so many set theoretic levels in use when
one talks about duality, we will revert to lower case letters x, y, z . . . for elements
of X and to make clear when we talk about the corresponding prime ﬁlter or the
complementary prime ideal we will denote these by Fx and Ix, respectively.
2.3. Stone and Priestley duality. For any bounded distributive lattice D the
following map is a bounded lattice homomorphism
ηD : D →P(XD)
a 7→ηD(a) = {x ∈XD | a ∈Fx}
Using the Axiom of Choice one may in addition show that D has enough prime
ﬁlters/ideals in the sense that this map also is injective. The Stone dual space [54]
of D is the topological space (XD, σ) where σ is the topology on XD generated by
the image of the map ηD, that is, by the basis
{ηD(a) | a ∈D}.
For a Boolean algebra this yields a compact Hausdorﬀspace for which the above
basis is precisely the collection of clopen subsets of the space. For a non-Boolean
bounded distributive lattice the corresponding Stone space is not T1 separated and
its specialization order is given by inclusion on the prime ﬁlters. The later Priestley
variant of Stone duality [46] relies on the fact that every bounded distributive
lattice, D, has a unique Boolean extension, D−, whose prime ﬁlters are in one-to-one
correspondence with the prime ﬁlters of D and that may be obtained by generating
a Boolean subalgebra of P(XD) with the image of ηD. Thus the Priestley dual space
of a bounded distributive lattice D is the ordered topological space (XD, ⩽, π) where
x ⩽y ⇐⇒Fx ⊇Fy ⇐⇒Ix ⊆Iy
and π is the topology on XD generated by the subbasis
{ηD(a), (ηD(a))c | a ∈D}.
In the case where the lattice D is a Boolean algebra, the Priestley duality agrees with
the original Stone duality for Boolean algebras [53] and we may refer to it as Stone
duality rather than as Priestley duality. The dual of a homomorphism h : D →E
between distributive lattices in Priestley duality (as well as in Stone duality) is the
map f : XE →XD such that f(x) = y if and only if h−1(Fx) = Fy. One can then
show that the space (XD, ⩽, π) is compact and totally order disconnected, that is,
for x, y ∈XD with x ≰y there is a clopen down-set U with y ∈U and x ̸∈U.
Also, for any homomorphism h : D →E, the map h−1 : XE →XD is continuous
and order preserving.
A Priestley space is an ordered topological space that is compact and totally
order disconnected and the morphisms of Priestley spaces are the order preserving
continuous maps. The dual of a Priestley space (X, ⩽, π) is the bounded distributive
lattice ClopD(X, ⩽, π) of all subsets of X that are simultaneously clopen and are

down-sets.
For ϕ : X →Y a morphism of Priestley spaces, the restriction of
the inverse image map to clopen down-sets, ϕ−1 : ClopD(Y ) →ClopD(X), is a
bounded lattice homomorphism and is the dual of ϕ under Priestley duality. The
translations back and forth given above account for Priestley duality. It allows
one to translate essentially all structure, concepts, and problems back and forth
between the two sides of the duality.
One particular case of this translation across the duality is the correspondence
between bounded sublattices of a lattice and the Priestley quotients of the dual
space of the lattice. This is central to this work, and, while it is well known to
duality theorists, we will supply some details here.
Let i : A ֒→B be an inclusion of bounded distributive lattices.
Its dual is
a quotient map XB
։ XA where x ∈XB is sent to the point of the dual of A
corresponding to the prime ﬁlter i−1(Fx) = Fx∩A. That is, in terms of prime ﬁlters,
the quotient map is given by restricting the prime ﬁlters of B to A. The kernel of
this quotient map is a quasiorder containing the order on XB. One can characterize
the quasiorders arising in this way and this describes the correspondence. However,
we can get something a bit better, namely, a Galois connection whose Galois closed
sets are the bounded sublattices on one side and the appropriate quasiorders on the
other.
Let B be bounded distributive lattice and S a subset of B. Then S gives rise to
a binary relation on XB given by
x ≼S y
⇐⇒
∀a ∈S
(a ∈Fy ⇒a ∈Fx).
It is easy to verify that ≼S is a quasiorder extending the order on XB. In the other
direction, given a subset E ⊆XB × XB, we obtain a subset AE of B given by
AE = {a ∈B | ∀(x, y) ∈E
(a ∈Fy ⇒a ∈Fx)}.
Here again it is easy to show that, for any E ⊆XB × XB, the set AE is a bounded
sublattice of B. The key facts are the following.
Proposition 2.6. Let B be a bounded distributive lattice and let A be a bounded
sublattice of B. Then we have
A≼A = A.
Proof. Let a0 ∈A and suppose x ≼A y, that is, (x, y) ∈≼A. Then by deﬁnition of
≼A, if a0 ∈Fy it follows that a0 ∈Fx and thus a0 ∈A≼A. Conversely, let b ∈A≼A.
Fix x ∈XB with b ̸∈Fx. For each y ∈XB with b ∈Fy we then must have x ̸≼A y
since b ∈A≼A. Thus there is ay ∈A with ay ∈Fy but ay ̸∈Fx. Now we have
ηB(b) = {y ∈XB | b ∈Fy} ⊆
[
{ηB(ay) | y ∈XB and b ∈Fy}.
By compactness of ηB(b), it follows that there are y1, . . . , yn ∈XB with ηB(b) ⊆
Sn
i=1 ηB(ayi). Let ax = Wn
i=1 ayi, then the following are true: b ⩽ax since ηB is a
lattice embedding and ax ∈A since each of the ays are in A and A is closed under
ﬁnite joins. Also ax ̸∈Fx since Fx is prime and ay ̸∈Fx for each y.
So for each x ∈XB with b ̸∈Fx, we have ax ∈A with b ⩽ax and ax ̸∈Fx. The
two latter facts correspond to x ∈(ηB(ax))c ⊆(ηB(b))c. Thus we have
(ηB(b))c =
[
{(ηB(ax))c | x ∈XB and b ̸∈Fx}.

MAI GEHRKE
Again, by compactness, there must be x1, . . . , xm ∈XB with b ̸∈Fxj for each j
and
(ηB(b))c =
m
[
j=1
(ηB(axj))c.
That is, b = Vm
j=1 axj and thus b ∈A since A is closed under ﬁnite meets and each
ax ∈A.
□
Further, it is easy to see that the quasiorders of the form ≼A have the following
characteristic property which we call compatibility.
Deﬁnition 2.7. Let B be a bounded distributive lattice, XB the dual space of B.
A quasiorder ≼on XB is said to be compatible provided it satisﬁes
∀x, y ∈XB
[x ̸≼y ⇒∃a ∈B (a ∈Fy and a ̸∈Fx and ηB(a) is a ≼-down-set)].
It is straight forward to show that ≼A≼=≼for any compatible quasiorder ≼
on the dual of a bounded distributive lattice as compatibility easily implies that
the corresponding quotient space is a Priestley space. Note that the assignments
E 7→AE and S 7→≼S are both derived from the relation
(x, y) R a
deﬁned by
a ∈Fy ⇒a ∈Fx.
and thus they form a Galois connection. To sum up we have the following result.
Theorem 2.8 ([51]). Let B be a bounded distributive lattice, XB the dual space of
B. The assignments
E 7→AE = {a ∈B | ∀(x, y) ∈E (a ∈Fy ⇒a ∈Fx)}
for E ⊆XB × XB and
S 7→≼S= {(x, y) ∈XB × XB | ∀a ∈S (a ∈Fy ⇒a ∈Fx)}
for S ⊆B establish a Galois connection whose Galois closed sets are the compatible
quasiorders and the bounded sublattices, respectively.
We note that, throughout, the special case of Stone duality for Boolean algebras
corresponds to the case where the order is trivial.
Remark 2.9. We also note that the Priestley space of a distributive lattice is actually
the dual space of the free Boolean extension D−of D equipped with the compatible
(quasi)order (which happens to be a partial order in this case, see [24, Proposition
8]) dual to the sublattice inclusion map D ֒→D−. For more details on this, see
[24, Theorem 5].
2.4. Extended Priestley duality. In extended Priestley duality [30], additional
operations on a distributive lattice are captured by additional relational structure
on the dual space, see also [28, 29]. Here we give a brief description of the relational
dual of the additional operations we will be most concerned with. We illustrate with
a binary operation but corresponding results hold for operations of any arity. It
is easiest to start with an operation · : D × D →D preserving ﬁnite (including
empty) joins in each coordinate. If D is ﬁnite, as in the discrete duality setting, it
is enough to know the operation on pairs of join-irreducible elements. In the setting
of arbitrary bounded distributive lattices this corresponds to knowing the action of

the operation on the prime ﬁlters. For this purpose we extend the operation to an
operation on the ﬁlter lattice in the obvious way:
·F ilt : Filt(D) × Filt(D) →Filt(D)
(F, G) 7→⟨F · G⟩F ilt
where ⟨F · G⟩F ilt = ↑{Vn
i=1(ai · bi) | ai ∈F and bi ∈G, i = 1, . . . , n} is the ﬁlter
generated by the product of F and G. The operation on ﬁlters will not in general
map pairs of prime ﬁlters to prime ﬁlters but the restriction of the operation to
pairs of prime ﬁlters may be encoded by the relation
R · = {(x, y, z) ∈(XD)3 | Fx ·F ilt Fy ⩾Fz}
= {(x, y, z) ∈(XD)3 | Fx · Fy ⊆Fz}.
In the case where the original operation preserves ﬁnite joins in each coordinate
one can show that one recovers the original operation as
ClopD(XD)2
−→
ClopD(XD)
(U, V )
7→
R ·[U, V, ] = {z ∈XD | ∃x ∈U, y ∈V R ·(x, y, z)}.
Further, it may be shown that the relations R corresponding to binary operations
that preserve ﬁnite joins in each coordinate are the ones satisfying the following
three properties [30]: (Notice that our last coordinate is the ﬁrst coordinate in [30])
(1) (⩾× ⩾) ◦R ◦⩾= R;
(2) For each x ∈X the set R[ , , x] is closed;
(3) For all U, V clopen down-sets of X the set R[U, V, ] is clopen.
For operations with other preservation properties one has to apply some order
duality (that is, turn the lattice upside-down). For this to work it is important
that all domain coordinates transform to joins in the codomain or all transform to
meets. For example, for an operation \ : D × D →D that sends ﬁnite joins in the
ﬁrst coordinate to ﬁnite meets and ﬁnite meets in the second coordinate to ﬁnite
meets (when one ﬁxes the other coordinate), we must ﬁrst extend \ to a function
from Filt(D) × Idl(D) into Idl(D) by setting
F\I = ⟨a\b | a ∈F and b ∈I ⟩Idl
for F ∈Filt(D) and I ∈Idl(D). The relation dual to \ is then
S \ = {(x, y, z) ∈X3 | Fx\Iz ⩽Iy}
= {(x, y, z) ∈X3 | Fx\Iz ⊆Iy}.
and the original operation \ is captured on clopen down-sets by
U\V = (S \[U, , V c])c = {y | ∀x, z [(x ∈U and S \(x, y, z)) =⇒z ∈V ]}.
Furthermore, a relation S is the dual of some operation \ which sends ﬁnite joins
in the ﬁrst coordinate to ﬁnite meets and ﬁnite meets in the second coordinate to
ﬁnite meets if and only if it satisﬁes the following three properties:
(1) (⩾× ⩾) ◦S ◦⩾= S;
(2) For each x ∈X the set S[ , x, ] is closed;
(3) For all U clopen down-set of X and V clopen up-set of X, the set S[U, , V ]
is clopen.

In the sequel we will be applying these results in a situation where we have a
family of operations (·, \, /)2 that form a residuated family on a bounded distributive
lattice D. That is, for all a, b, c ∈D we have
a · b ⩽c ⇐⇒b ⩽a\c
⇐⇒a ⩽c/b.
In this case one can prove that all three operations are encoded on the dual space
by a single relation R which may be deﬁned by any of the following equivalent
conditions
R(x, y, z) ⇐⇒Fx · Fy ⩾Fz ⇐⇒Fx\Iz ⩽Iy ⇐⇒Iz/Fy ⩽Ix.
Conversely, given a ternary relation R on a Priestley space X, which is order-
compatible so that it satisﬁes
(⩾× ⩾) ◦R ◦⩾= R,
we obtain, via discrete duality, a residuated family of maps on the lattice of down-
sets of X given by
S · T = R[S, T, ] = {z | ∃x, y [x ∈S and y ∈T and R(x, y, z)]}
S\T = (R[S, , T c])c = {y | ∀x, z [(x ∈S and R(x, y, z)) =⇒z ∈T ]}
T/S = (R[ , S, T c])c = {x | ∀y, z [(y ∈S and R(x, y, z)) =⇒z ∈T ]}.
However, the lattice of clopen down-sets may not be closed under some of these
while being closed under others. In particular, a relation R can be the topological
dual for one of these operations while not being so for another one. This is deter-
mined by the topological properties of the relation R. As stated above, this relation
R is dual to an operation · on D with the third coordinate as output variable if and
only if
(1) For each x ∈X the set R[ , , x] is closed;
(2) For all U, V clopen down-sets of X the set R[U, V, ] is clopen.
When this is the case we say that R is Priestley-compatible for the last coordinate.
We state the topological properties for the residual operations in a deﬁnition as
these are particularly central in this work and we will want to refer to them later.
Deﬁnition 2.10. Let X be a Priestley space and R ⊆Xn×X an order-compatible
relation on X. For 1 ⩽i ⩽n, we say that R is Priestley-compatible with i as the
output coordinate provided:
(1) For each x ∈X the set R[ , x, ], where x occurs in the ith coordinate, is
closed;
(2) For all U1, . . . , Ui−1 and Vi+1 . . . , Vn clopen down-set of X and for all W
clopen up-set of X, the set R[U, , V , W] is clopen.
In the setting of lattices with additional operations, we want homomorphisms to
preserve both the lattice structure and the additional operations. The dual notion
is known under the name of bounded morphism, see e.g. [30]. This is the functional
version of bisimulation in modal logic.
2Sometimes we won’t have all the operations of the residuated family available on the lattice.

Deﬁnition 2.11. Let X and Y be Priestley spaces, R ⊆X3 and S ⊆Y 3 order-
compatible relations on X and Y , respectively. If R and S are Priestley-compatible
with respect to the last coordinate, then we say that a continuous and order-
preserving function ϕ : X →Y is a bounded morphism for these relations with
respect to the last coordinate if and only if the following two properties, known as
the Back and Forth properties, hold for all x1, x2, x3 ∈X and all y1, y2 ∈Y
(Forth) (R(x1, x2, x3) ⇒S(ϕ(x1), ϕ(x2), ϕ(x3)) );
(Back) (S(y1, y2, ϕ(x3)) ⇒∃x1, x2 [ (y1, y2) ⩾(ϕ(x1), ϕ(x2)) and R(x1, x2, x3) ] ).
Similarly, if R ⊆X3 and S ⊆Y 3 are Priestley-compatible with respect to the
second coordinate (that is, they are duals of operations of the type \), then we say
that a continuous and order-preserving function ϕ : X →Y is a bounded morphism
for these relations with respect to the second coordinate if and only if the following
two properties hold for all x1, x2, x3 ∈X and all y1, y3 ∈Y
(Forth) (R(x1, x2, x3) ⇒S(ϕ(x1), ϕ(x2), ϕ(x3)) );
(Back) (S(y1, ϕ(x2), y3) ⇒∃x1, x3 [ y1 ⩾ϕ(x1), R(x1, x2, x3), and ϕ(x3) ⩾y3]).
If R ⊆X3 and S ⊆Y 3 are Priestley-compatible with respect to the ﬁrst co-
ordinate (that is, they are duals of operations of the type /), then we say that a
continuous and order-preserving function ϕ : X →Y is a bounded morphism for
these relations with respect to the ﬁrst coordinate if and only if the following two
properties hold for all x1, x2, x3 ∈X and all y2, y3 ∈Y
(Forth) (R(x1, x2, x3) ⇒S(ϕ(x1), ϕ(x2), ϕ(x3)) );
(Back) (S(ϕ(x1), y2, y3) ⇒∃x2, x3 [y2 ⩾ϕ(x2), R(x1, x2, x3), and ϕ(x3) ⩾y3]).
Finally, we note that in the special case where ϕ is surjective, and thus corre-
sponds to a compatible quasiorder ≼on X, if the quotient map is a bounded mor-
phism for relations R on X and S on the quotient Priestley space (X/≡, ≼/≡, π/≡)
with respect to any one of their coordinates, then S is the quotient relation, R/≼,
in the sense that for all (x, x) ∈Xn × X we have
([x1], . . . , [xn]) S [x]
⇐⇒
x [≽n ◦R ◦≽] x.
3. Topological algebras as dual spaces
In this section we study the relationship between extended dual spaces and topo-
logical algebras. As we have seen in the previous section, an extended dual space is
a Boolean space, or a Priestley space, with additional relations having some topo-
logical, and, in the case of Priestley spaces, order-theoretic properties. Boolean-
topological algebras are Boolean spaces equipped with continuous operations. Our
main result in this section is that Boolean-topological algebras are precisely the ex-
tended dual spaces for which the additional relations are functional. Thus Boolean-
topological algebras are special extended dual spaces. In the Priestley setting the
relationship is a bit more complicated: All Priestley topological algebras are ex-
tended dual spaces but they do not comprise all the functional ones.
Once we have established these results, we characterize those distributive lattices
with additional operations whose extended dual spaces have functional relations.
Finally we identify the lattice theoretic duals of morphisms and quotients of Boolean
and Priestley topological algebras. In particular we show that the dual of a Boolean-
topological quotient is what we will call a residuation ideal.

3.1. Functional dual relations. Let X be a Priestley space and R an (n+1)-ary
relation on X that is order-compatible. As we have seen in the previous section,
R corresponds via discrete duality to a residuated family of n-ary operations on
the DL+, D(X), consisting of all down-sets of X. Depending on the topological
properties of this relation, it may then be the dual of any number of these operations
restricted to the dual lattice. In any case, order compatibility makes it impossible
for the relation to be functional unless the order is trivial (the Boolean case) or the
value of the function is always minimal in X. In order to encompass a richer class
of structures we give the following relaxed deﬁnition of functionality for relations
on Priestley spaces.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let X be a Priestley space and R ⊆Xn×X an (n+1)-ary relation
on X. We say that R is functional provided there is an n-ary operation, f, on X
such that for all x ∈Xn and all z ∈X, we have R(x, z) if and only if f(x) ⩾z.
Note that if R is functional then the corresponding operation on X is uniquely
given by f(x) = max{z ∈X | R(x, z)}. The truth of the following proposition is
easy to verify.
Proposition 3.2. Let X be a Priestley space and R a functional relation on X
with f the corresponding operation. Then f is order preserving if and only if R is
order-compatible.
The following establishes a link between continuity of an operation on a Priestley
space and the corresponding functional relation being the topological dual of the
residual operations given by the relation.
Proposition 3.3. Let X be a Priestley space and R ⊆Xn×X an order-compatible
functional relation on X with f the corresponding operation. Then the following
conditions are related by (1) ⇒(2), (2) ⇒(3), and (3) ⇒(4).
(1) The operation f is continuous with respect to the Priestley topology.
(2) For each i with 1 ⩽i ⩽n and all x ∈X, R[
, x,
] (where x is in the ith
spot) is closed in Xn and for all clopen down-sets Uj, V ⊆X the relational
image R[U1, . . . , Ui−1, , Ui+1, . . . , V c] is clopen.
(3) There is an i with 1 ⩽i ⩽n such that for all x ∈X, R[
, x,
] (where x
is in the ith spot) is closed in Xn and for all clopen down-sets Uj, V ⊆X
the relational image R[U1, . . . , Ui−1, , Ui+1, . . . , V c] is clopen.
(4) The operation f is continuous with respect to the spectral topology.
Proof. Assuming that (1) holds, we just prove (2) for i = 1 to minimize notation.
If f is continuous in the Priestley topology, then, for each x1 ∈X, the function
fx1 : Xn−1 →X given by y 7→f(x1, y) is continuous in the Priestley topology
and thus its graph, G(fx1), is closed in Xn. Also notice that if Xop denotes the
Priestley space obtained by reversing the order of X, then R[x1,
] is the down-set
of G(fx1) in the order of the space (Xop)n−1 × X. Now using the fact that the
product of Priestley spaces is a Priestley space, and that down-sets of closed sets
are closed in Priestley spaces [17, Exercise11.14(ii)], we conclude that R[x1,
] is
closed.
Let U2, . . . , Un, V be clopen down-sets in X. By continuity of f, the set f −1(V c)
is clopen. Also, because V c is an up-set, f −1(V c) = R[
, V c]. Now let π : X ×
Xn−1 →X be the projection onto the ﬁrst coordinate, then
R[ , U2, . . . , Un, V c] = π(R[
, V c] ∩(X × U2 × . . . × Un)).

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION

Since the intersection of clopen sets is clopen, projections of open sets are open,
and projections of closed sets along compact Hausdorﬀspaces are closed, it follows
that R[ , U2, . . . , Un, V c] is clopen. This completes the proof of (1) implies (2).
In order to prove that (3) implies (4), we assume (3) holds for i = 1 and prove that
f is continuous with respect to the spectral topology. To this end, let (x1, . . . , xn) ∈
Xn with z = f(x1, . . . , xn) ∈V , where V is a clopen down-set in X. Since R[x1,
]
is closed and V is clopen, it follows that R[x1,
]∩(Xn×V c) is closed. Furthermore,
since the projection π′ : Xn−1 × X →Xn−1 is a projection along a compact space,
it is a closed map and thus
π′(R[x1,
] ∩(Xn−1 × V c))
is closed. Notice that since V c is an up-set we have
π′(R[x1,
] ∩(Xn−1 × V c)) = {(y2, . . . , yn) ∈Xn−1 | ∃z ∈V c f(x1, y2, . . . , yn) ⩾z}
= {(y2, . . . , yn) ∈Xn−1 | f(x1, y2, . . . , yn) ∈V c}
= f −1
x1 (V c)
where fx1 : Xn−1 →X is is the restriction of f as deﬁned above. It thus follows that
f −1
x1 (V ) is open. Since it is also a down-set and x = (x2, . . . , xn) ∈f −1
x1 (V ), there
are clopen down-sets U2, . . . , Un with x ∈U2 × . . . × Un ⊆f −1
x1 (V ). We have x1 ̸∈
R[ , U2, . . . , Un, V c], and thus x1 ∈(R[ , U2, . . . , Un, V c])c = U1 which is a down-set
and is in addition clopen by condition (3). That is, (x1, . . . , xn) ∈U1×U2×. . .×Un
and each Ui is a clopen down-set. Furthermore, if (y1, . . . , yn) ∈U1 × U2 × . . . × Un
then y1 ∈U1 = (R[ , U2, . . . , Un, V c])c and thus
y1 ̸∈R[ , U2, . . . , Un, V c]
= {y′ | ∃(y′
2, . . . , y′
n) ∈U2 × . . . × Un f(y′, y′
2, . . . , y′
n) ̸∈V }.
That is, for all (y′
2, . . . , y′
n) ∈U2 × . . . × Un we have f(y1, y′
2, . . . , y′
n) ∈V and in
particular f(y1, y2, . . . , yn) ∈V . We have shown then that (x1, . . . , xn) ∈U1 ×U2 ×
. . . × Un ⊆f −1(V ) and thus that f is continuous in the spectral topology.
□
In the Boolean case, we obtain a stronger result since the Priestley and the spec-
tral topologies are one and the same so that conditions (1) and (4) are equivalent.
Corollary 3.4. Let X be a Boolean space and let f be an n-ary operation on X
and suppose R ⊆Xn × X is the graph of f. Then the following conditions are
equivalent:
(1) There is an i with 1 ⩽i ⩽n such that R is the extended Stone dual of the
operation (U1, . . . , Un) 7→R[U1, . . . ,
, . . . , Un] (with the co-domain slot in
the ith place) on the dual Boolean algebra.
(2) For each i with 1 ⩽i ⩽n, the relation R is the extended Stone dual of the
operation (U1, . . . , Un) 7→R[U1, . . . ,
, . . . , Un] (with the co-domain slot in
the ith place) on the dual Boolean algebra.
(3) The operation f is continuous.
Proposition 3.3 and its corollary allow us to relate extended dual spaces and the
standard notion of topological algebras.
Deﬁnition 3.5. Given an operational type τ, a topological algebra of type τ is an
algebra of type τ in the category of topological spaces. That is, it is a topological

14
MAI GEHRKE
space equipped with an algebraic structure of type τ for which each basic opera-
tion is continuous (in the case of an n-ary operation we equip the domain with the
product topology). Homomorphisms of topological algebras are maps which are
simultaneously homomorphisms for the algebra structure and continuous for the
topological structure. Isomorphisms must also be homeomorphisms for the topo-
logical part of the structure. A topological algebra is said to be a Boolean-topological
algebra provided the underlying topological space is a Boolean space, i.e., it is com-
pact Hausdorﬀwith a basis of clopen sets. Finally, a Priestley topological algebra
is an algebra in the category of Priestley spaces. That is, it is a Priestley space
equipped with an algebra structuresuch that each basic operation of the algebra
is not only continuous but also order preserving. The homomorphisms are algebra
homomorphisms that are continuous and order preserving, whereas isomorphisms
also have to be homeomorphisms for the topological structure and isomorphisms
for the order structure.
Applying the implications (1)⇒(2) and/or (1)⇒(3), and noticing that conditions
(2) and (3) are precisely the n-ary versions of the conditions for being dual to a
residual operation given in Deﬁnition 2.10, we obtain the following corollary of
Proposition 3.3.
Corollary 3.6. Every Priestley topological algebra is the dual space of some bounded
distributive lattice with additional operations.
Corollary 3.7. The Boolean-topological algebras are precisely the extended Boolean
dual spaces of Boolean algebras with residuation operations for which the dual rela-
tions are functional.
Proposition 3.3 establishes a connection between the duals of residual operations
and continuous maps. One may wonder what it takes for the forward image map
to be the dual of an operation. Using the condition, as given in Section 2, on a
relation equivalent to it being the dual of the forward image operation, we obtain
the following requirements in the case of a functional relation on a Boolean space:
(1) For all x ∈X the preimage f −1(x) is closed;
(2) The forward image of a tuple of clopens is clopen.
Without continuity this is not a very natural condition for a map between topolog-
ical spaces. However, we do obtain the following useful corollary.
Corollary 3.8. Let X be a Boolean-topological algebra, B the dual Boolean algebra,
and f one of the basic operations of X. Then f is an open mapping if and only if
B is closed under the forward operation (U1, . . . , Un) 7→f[U1 × . . . × Un], and in
this case the graph R of f is also the relational dual to this forward operation on
B.
Proof. Since all continuous maps from compact spaces to Hausdorﬀspaces are
closed mappings, it follows that B is closed under the operation (U1, . . . , Un) 7→
f[U1 × . . . × Un] if and only if f is an open map. The conditions required for R
to be the dual of this operations are f −1(x) = R[
, x] closed for each x ∈X and
f[U1 × . . . × Un] = R[U1, . . . , Un, ] clopen whenever the Uis are clopen.
For f
continuous and X Hausdorﬀthe ﬁrst condition always holds. And if in addition f
is open, then the second also holds.

In the remainder of this subsection we investigate the relationship between the
conditions (1)–(4) of Proposition 3.3 further. In particular we show that, for Priest-
ley spaces in general, condition (1) is equivalent to (2) (and (3)) in the case of unary
operations, but that (2) and (3) are equivalent to neither of (1) and (4) in general.
Proposition 3.9. Let X be a Priestley space and R ⊆X × X an order-compatible
and functional binary relation on X with f the corresponding operation. Then the
following conditions are equivalent.
(1) The operation f is continuous with respect to the Priestley topology.
(2) For all x ∈X, R[x, ] is closed in X and for all clopen down-sets V ⊆X
the relational image R[ , V c] is clopen.
Furthermore, if these conditions are satisﬁed, then the dual operation V 7→(R[ , V c])c
is the distributive lattice homomorphism dual to f.
Proof. We already know from Proposition 3.3 that (1) implies (2). For the reverse
implication, note that if V is a clopen down-set then its complement is an up-set,
and for up-sets U we have
R[ , U] = {x ∈X | ∃y ∈U with f(x) ⩾y} = {x ∈X | f(x) ∈U} = f −1[U].
So condition (2) implies that the preimages of clopen up-sets are clopen. Now since
f −1[U c] = (f −1[U])c, the preimages of clopen down-sets are also clopen, and since
the clopen up-sets and clopen down-sets together form a subbasis for the Priestley
topology, it follows that (2) implies (1) as required.
Finally, we now see that the operation V 7→(R[ , V c])c is equal to the lat-
tice homomorphism V 7→f −1[V ] since, by the above computation (R[ , V c])c =
(f −1[V c])c = ((f −1[V ])c)c = f −1[V ] for any clopen down-set V .
□
We thus see that unary Priestley topological algebras are rather trivial, as one
also expects since the dual of an order preserving continuous map under Priestley
duality is a homomorphism.
Corollary 3.10. The unary Priestley topological algebras are precisely the extended
Priestley dual spaces of distributive lattices with additional operations which are
endomorphisms of the lattice.
As detailed in the following example, we can also use Proposition 3.9 to show
that the last condition of Proposition 3.3 is not equivalent to the ﬁrst three in
general.
Example 3.11. Consider the bounded distributive lattice D of all subsets of Z
which are either ﬁnite or Z itself. The Priestley dual of D is the poset X = Z ⊕∞
obtained by adding ∞as a top to the trivially ordered anti-chain Z. The topology
on X is the one of the one-point compactiﬁcation by ∞of the discrete space on Z.
Now consider the map f : X →X which sends any k ∈Z to 0 and ∞to ∞. Then f
is continuous in the spectral topology but not in the Priestley topology. Conditions
(2) and (3) of Proposition 3.3 also are not satisﬁed since, by Proposition 3.9, these
are equivalent to continuity in the Priestley topology in the unary case.
Finally, we also give an example to show that the ﬁrst condition of Proposition 3.3
is not equivalent to the last three in general.
Example 3.12. Consider again the bounded distributive lattice D of all subsets
of Z which are either ﬁnite or Z itself. We consider the residuals of addition on

16
MAI GEHRKE
Z lifted to the power set of Z. Since addition is commutative, the right and left
residuals agree and we need only consider one of them. Note that for A, B ∈P(Z),
we have
A/B =
\
{A/k | k ∈B} =
\
{A −k | k ∈B}.
Further, it is clear that D is closed under ( )−k as F −k = {n−k | n ∈F} is again
ﬁnite for F ﬁnite and Z −k = Z. Also, D is closed under arbitrary intersections,
so D is closed under residuation. As in the previous example, the Priestley dual of
D is the poset X = Z ⊕∞obtained by adding ∞as a top to the trivially ordered
anti-chain Z and the topology on X is the one of the one-point compactiﬁcation
by ∞of the discrete space on Z. It is straight forward to verify that the ternary
relation dual to the residuation operation on D is functional with its upper edge
given by addition on X deﬁned as usual; for i, j ∈Z:
+
i
∞
j
i + j

Since we are dealing with the extended dual of a residuation operation, conditions
(2) and (3), and thus also (4) of Proposition 3.3 must be satisﬁed. However, this ad-
dition operation is not continuous in the Priestley topology since, e.g., the singleton
{0} is clopen but its preimage, {(k, −k) | k ∈Z}, is open but not closed.
We conclude that in Proposition 3.3 conditions (2) and (3) are neither equivalent
to condition (1) nor to condition (4) in general. We postpone a characterization of
the duals of Priestley topological algebras to Section 3.4.
3.2. Residuation algebras preserving joins at primes. In this subsection, we
characterize the additional operations on lattices for which the extended Priestley
dual relations are functional. In the exposition, we will mainly focus on the binary
case in order to lighten the notation. The results do go through for higher arities
as well though.
For a unary operation on a lattice, we saw in Proposition 3.9, that its dual
relation is functional if and only if the operation is in fact an endomorphism of
the lattice. However, the situation is far from this trivial in the binary and higher
arity setting. In fact, in arities greater than or equal to two, a dual relation may
be functional without the original map preserving both meet and join.
To see
this, consider the set X = {0, 1, −1} with the ternary relation given by usual
multiplication. The binary residuation operation / on B = P(X) preserves meet
in its ﬁrst coordinate and reverses joins in the second, that is, the identities (A1 ∩
A2)/B = (A1/B) ∩(A2/B) and A/(B1 ∪B2) = (A/B1) ∩(A/B2) hold in B.
However, the operation / does not preserve join in the ﬁrst coordinate nor does it
reverse meets in the second, e.g., {−1, 1}/{−1, 1} = {−1, 1} but {−1}/{−1, 1} =
∅= {1}/{−1, 1}, and {1}/∅= X is strictly larger than the union of {1}/{1} = {1}
and {1}/{−1} = {−1}.
As we have seen in the previous subsection, the appropriate operations on lattices
dual to functional relations are residuation operations.
We make the following
deﬁnition.

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION
17
Deﬁnition 3.13. A (binary) residuation algebra is a bounded distributive lattice,
D, equipped with two binary operations \, / : D × D →D with the following
properties:
(1) ∀a, b1, b2 ∈D
a\(b1 ∧b2) = (a\b1) ∧(a\b2).
(2) ∀a1, a2, b ∈D
(a1 ∧a2)/b = (a1/b) ∧(a2/b).
(3) The two operations \ and / are linked by the Galois property:
∀a, b, c ∈D
b ⩽a\c ⇐⇒a ⩽c/b.
Note that, under the assumption of (3) conditions (1) and (2) are equivalent so that
one holds if and only if the other does. The Galois property (3) also implies that
the following two properties hold:
(4) ∀a1, a2, b ∈D
(a1 ∨a2)\b = (a1\b) ∧(a2\b).
(5) ∀a, b1, b2 ∈D
a/(b1 ∨b2) = (a/b1) ∧(a/b2).
In general, for an operational type τ, by residuation algebra of type τ, we mean
a bounded distributive lattice with operations corresponding to the n residuals of
an n-ary operation for each n-ary function symbol in τ. We call such an algebra a
Boolean residuation algebra provided the underlying lattice is Boolean.
For simplicity of notation, we will mainly deal with the binary case. Given a
binary residuation algebra we have a ternary dual relation R on the dual X of D
which encodes both the operations and which is given by
R(x, y, z) ⇐⇒Fx\Iz ⩽Iy ⇐⇒Iz/Fy ⩽Ix.
As explained in Section 2.4, this relation will be Priestley compatible with respect
to the ﬁrst two coordinates.
Even though a residuation algebra D does not in
general have an operation · for which \ and / are the residuals, we do obtain a
product operation on the ﬁlter lattice of D.
Proposition 3.14. Let D be a binary residuation algebra and (X, ⩽, π, R) its ex-
tended Priestley dual. Then we have an operation · : Filt(D) × Filt(D) →Filt(D)
given by
F · G = {c | ∃a ∈F with a\c ∈G}.
Further, it is related to the liftings of \ and / and to R by the following multi-sorted
residuation property
∀x, y, z ∈X
R(x, y, z) ⇐⇒Fx · Fy ⩾Fz ⇐⇒Fx\Iz ⩽Iy ⇐⇒Iz/Fy ⩽Ix.
In general, given a residuation algebra of type τ, we obtain, for each n-ary operation
symbol, an n-ary operation on the ﬁlter lattice.
Proof. We just prove the proposition in the binary case. Let F, G ∈Filt(D) and
H = {c | ∃a ∈F with a\c ∈G}. Since \ is order preserving in its second coordinate
and G is an up-set, it is clear that H is an up-set. Also as 1\1 = 1, H is non-empty.
We show that H is closed under binary meet. To this end, let ai ∈F with ai\ci ∈G
for i = 1 and 2. Then (a1 ∧a2)\ci ⩾ai\ci and thus (a1 ∧a2)\ci ∈G for i = 1 and
2. It follows that
[(a1 ∧a2)\c1] ∧[(a1 ∧a2)\c2] = (a1 ∧a2)\(c1 ∧c2) ∈G.
Now since F is a ﬁlter a1 ∧a2 ∈F and thus c1 ∧c2 ∈H and F ·G as given is indeed
a ﬁlter. For the second assertion, let x, y, z ∈X. Note that we just need to show
that Fx · Fy ⩾Fz is equivalent to the three other conditions as they are already

18
MAI GEHRKE
known to be equivalent by the basic extended duality results. To this end, suppose
Fx\Iz ⩽Iy and c is such that there exists a ∈Fx with a\c ∈Fy. It clearly follows
that c ̸∈Iz and thus c ∈Fz as required. Conversely, suppose Fx · Fy ⩾Fz, that is,
{c | ∃a ∈Fx with a\c ∈Fy} ⊆Fz and let a ∈Fx and c ∈Iz. Then c ̸∈Fz and thus
a\c ̸∈Fy. That is, a\c ∈Iy as required.
□
We have just shown the existence of a binary operation on the lattice of all ﬁlters
of a residuation algebra (D, \, /) for which \ and / are in some sense the residuals.
The existence of this operation and its relation to \ and / is much simpler to
understand from the point of view of canonical extensions. There, one may show
that the so-called π-extensions of \ and / have a lower adjoint on the canonical
extension of D. The operation given here on ﬁlters is then the restriction of this
operation to the ﬁlter elements of the canonical extension. For more details, see
[27, Lemma 2.22] and the approach in [22].
Proposition 3.15. Let D be a binary residuation algebra and (X, ⩽, π, R) its ex-
tended Priestley dual. The following conditions are equivalent:
(1) The operation · : Filt(D)×Filt(D) →Filt(D) sends prime ﬁlters to prime
ﬁlters.
(2) ∀a, b, c ∈D ∀x ∈X (a ∈Fx
=⇒
∃a′ ∈Fx [a\(b ∨c) ⩽(a′\b) ∨(a′\c)]).
(3) ∀x ∈X the map Fx\( ) : Idl(D) →Idl(D) is ∨-preserving.
A corresponding result holds for residuation algebras of arbitrary type.
Proof. (1)⇒(2): Let a, b, c ∈D and x ∈X with a ∈Fx. Further let y ∈X with
a\(b ∨c) ∈Fy. Then b ∨c ∈Fx · Fy and by (1) it follows that b ∈Fx · Fy or
c ∈Fx · Fy. Thus there is a′ ∈Fx with a′\b ∈Fy or a′\c ∈Fy. In either case, it
follows that (a′\b) ∨(a′\c) ∈Fy. Thus we have
ηD(a\[b ∨c]) ⊆
[
a′∈Fx
ηD(a′\b) ∪ηD(a′\c)
where ηD : D →P(X) is the embedding given by Priestley duality. Since ηD(a\[b∨
c]) is compact there are a′
1, . . . , a′
n ∈Fx with
ηD(a\[b ∨c]) ⊆ηD(a′
1\b) ∪ηD(a′
1\c) ∪. . . ∪ηD(a′
n\b) ∪ηD(a′
n\c)
= ηD([a′′\b] ∨[a′′\c])
where a′′ = a′
1∧. . .∧a′
n. That is, a\[b∨c] ⩽[a′′\b]∨[a′′\c] and a′′ ∈Fx as required.
(2)⇒(3): Let x ∈X and let I and J be ideals of D. It is clear that Fx\I∨Fx\J ⊆
Fx\(I ∨J) since the operation Fx\( ) is order preserving. Now let a ∈Fx and
d ⩽b ∨c where b ∈I and c ∈J. Then a\d ⩽a\(b ∨c) and by (2) there is a′ ∈Fx
with a\(b ∨c) ⩽(a′\b) ∨(a′\c). Since a′\b ∈Fx\I and a′\c ∈Fx\J it follows that
a\d ∈Fx\I ∨Fx\J and thus the operation Fx\( ) is join preserving.
(3)⇒(1): Let x, y ∈X. We want to show that Fx · Fy is prime. Let b, c ∈D
and suppose b ̸∈Fx · Fy and c ̸∈Fx · Fy. Note that b ̸∈Fx · Fy implies that for
all a ∈Fx we have a\b ̸∈Fy, that is, a\b ∈Iy and thus, as \ is order preserving
in the second coordinate, Fx\↓b ⊆Iy. Similarly, Fx\↓c ⊆Iy. Now, since Fx\( ) is
join preserving, we have Fx\↓(b ∨c) = Fx\(↓b ∨↓c) = (Fx\↓b) ∨(Fx\↓c) and thus
Fx\↓(b ∨c) ⊆Iy. That is, b ∨c ̸∈Fx · Fy and, by contraposition, we have proved
that Fx · Fy is prime.

Note that the ﬁrst condition is equivalent to \ and / sending primes (ﬁlter-ideal
pairs and ideal-ﬁlter pairs, respectively) to prime ideals.
Deﬁnition 3.16. Let D be a binary residuation algebra. If the equivalent condi-
tions of Proposition 3.15 hold, then we say that residuation is join preserving at
primes. In this case we denote by · also the function from X × X to X such that
Fx·y = Fx · Fy.
For a residuation algebra of type τ, if the operation on ﬁlters sends tuples of
primes to primes for each basic operation symbol of the type then the dual space
becomes a τ algebra in these operations restricted to primes and we say that resid-
uation is join preserving at primes.
Note that if residuation in a residuation algebra D is join preserving at primes,
then the relation R dual to a binary operation symbol · is given by R(x, y, z) ⇔
x · y ⩾z. In the Boolean case this means that R is the graph of the operation · on
X and in the distributive lattice case that · is the ‘upper-edge’ of R. In either case,
this is precisely the meaning of R being functional as in Deﬁnition 3.1. Combining
Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.15, we now obtain the following result.
Theorem 3.17. Let τ be an operational type. Boolean-topological algebras of type
τ are, up to isomorphism, precisely the extended Stone duals of Boolean residuation
algebras of type τ for which residuation is join preserving at primes.
We do not know whether the property of preserving joins at primes is equivalent
to a ﬁrst-order property of residuation algebras.
3.3. Duals of Priestley topological algebra morphisms. We have seen that
Boolean and Priestley topological algebras are special extended dual spaces. How-
ever, the appropriate maps for extended dual spaces are the bounded morphisms
as described at the end of Section 2.4 and the appropriate maps for topological al-
gebras are continuous homomorphisms. We start by observing that, in the Boolean
case, a continuous map between Boolean-topological algebras is a homomorphism
for a basic operation f if and only if it satisﬁes the (Forth) condition, as given at
the end of Section 2, for any (and then all) of the residuated family of operations
associated with the graph R of f. We spell out the ensuing result for a binary
operation in the following proposition. A corresponding result holds in any arity.
Proposition 3.18. Let ϕ : X →Y be a continuous map between Boolean-topological
algebras of the same type τ and h : C →B the Boolean algebra homomorphism dual
to ϕ. Let · be a basic binary operation symbol for the type τ and \, / the residuation
operations dual to ·. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) For all x1, x2 ∈X we have ϕ(x1 · x2) = ϕ(x1) · ϕ(x2).
(2) For all c1, c2 ∈C we have h(c1\c2) ⩽h(c1)\h(c2).
(3) For all c1, c2 ∈C we have h(c1/c2) ⩽h(c1)/h(c2).
Proof. Condition (1) is clearly equivalent to the condition
(Forth)
(R(x1, x2, x3) ⇒S(ϕ(x1), ϕ(x2), ϕ(x3)) )
where R is the graph of the operation denoted by f in X and S is the graph of
the operation denoted by f in Y . One may easily verify, see e.g. the proof of [30,
Theorem 2.3.1(1)] or the last part of [24, Section 5], that the (Forth) condition
corresponds, for a dual operator, to the inclusions given in (2) and (3).

In the distributive setting, the (Forth) condition only tells us that ϕ(x1 · x2) ⩽
ϕ(x1) · ϕ(x2), and, even in the Boolean case, the above proposition does not give
the complete picture. Of central importance to the work on recognition is to know
which Boolean subalgebras of the dual of a Boolean-topological algebra are dual to
algebraic quotients and the above result does not help us in answering this question.
The following result for the distributive setting is much more useful in this regard.
Theorem 3.19. Let ϕ : X →Y be a continuous and order preserving map between
Priestley topological algebras of the same type τ and h : E →D the distributive
lattice homomorphism dual to ϕ. Let · be a basic binary operation symbol for the
type τ and \, / the residuation operations dual to ·. Then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(1) For all x1, x2 ∈X we have ϕ(x1 · x2) = ϕ(x1) · ϕ(x2).
(2) For all a ∈D, e ∈E there is e′ ∈E with a ⩽h(e′) and a\h(e) = h(e′\e).
(3) For all a ∈D, e ∈E there is e′ ∈E with a ⩽h(e′) and h(e)/a = h(e/e′).
Proof. We just prove that (1) and (2) are equivalent; the proof of the equivalence
of (1) and (3) being similar. In order to prove that (1) implies (2), consider a ∈D
and e ∈E. Then a\h(e) ∈D and thus ηD(a\h(e)) is a clopen down-set of X. By
duality and since R(x1, x2, x3) if and only if x3 ⩽x1 · x2, we have
ηD(a\h(e)) = (R[ηD(a),
, (ηD(h(e)))c])c
=
 R[ηD(a),
, (ϕ−1(ηE(e)))c]
c
= {z ∈X | ∀z′ (z′ ∈ηD(a) =⇒z′ · z ∈ϕ−1(ηE(e))}
= {z ∈X | ϕ(ηD(a) · {z}) ⊆ηE(e)}.
Now by (1) it follows that ϕ(ηD(a) · {z}) = ϕ(ηD(a)) · {ϕ(z)} so that
ηD(a\h(e)) = {z ∈X | ϕ(ηD(a)) · {ϕ(z)} ⊆ηE(e)}.
Also, since ηE(e) is a down-set and · is order preserving, we have
ηD(a\h(e)) = {z ∈X | ↓ϕ(ηD(a)) · {ϕ(z)} ⊆ηE(e)}.
Note that, since ϕ is continuous, X is compact, and Y is Hausdorﬀ, it follows that
ϕ(ηD(a)) is closed. Also, since the down-set of a closed set in a Priestley space
is again closed [17, Exercise 11.14(ii)], it follows that ↓ϕ(ηD(a)) is a closed down-
set in Y . But closed down-sets in Priestley spaces are all intersections of clopen
down-sets, see [17, Exercise 11.14(iii)]. So
↓ϕ(ηD(a)) =
\
{ηE(e′) | ϕ(ηD(a)) ⊆ηE(e′)}
Now, by the deﬁnition of ϕ as the dual of h, we have for all e′ ∈E
ϕ(ηD(a)) ⊆ηE(e′)
⇐⇒
ηD(a) ⊆ϕ−1(ηE(e′)
⇐⇒
a ⩽h(e′).
It follows that
↓ϕ(ηD(a)) =
\
{ηE(e′) | a ⩽h(e′), e′ ∈E}.
Accordingly the condition ↓ϕ(ηD(a)) · {ϕ(z)} ⊆ηE(e) is equivalent to
\
{ηE(e′) | a ⩽h(e′), e′ ∈E}

· {ϕ(z)} ⊆ηE(e),

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION
21
and since multiplication by ϕ(z) is a continuous function, X is compact, and Y is
T1, it is a general topological fact that
\
{ηE(e′) | a ⩽h(e′), e′ ∈E}

· {ϕ(z)} =
\
{ηE(e′) · {ϕ(z)} | a ⩽h(e′), e′ ∈E}.
By compactness we obtain
ηD(a\h(e)) = {z ∈X | ∃e′ ∈E with a ⩽h(e′) and ηE(e′) · {ϕ(z)} ⊆ηE(e)}
=
[
{ηD(h(e′\e)) | e′ ∈E and a ⩽h(e′)}.
And ﬁnally by compactness again, there is e′ ∈E with a ⩽h(e′) such that
ηD(a\h(e)) = ηD(h(e′\e)) or equivalently a\h(e) = h(e′\e).
For the converse, suppose (2) holds and let x1, x2 ∈X. In order to show that
ϕ(x1 · x2) = ϕ(x1) · ϕ(x2), it suﬃces to show that for all e ∈E we have ϕ(x1 · x2) ∈
ηE(e) if and only if ϕ(x1) · ϕ(x2) ∈ηE(e). To this end, using the deﬁnition of
the product relative to the residuals and using (2), we have the following string of
equivalences:
ϕ(x1 · x2) ∈ηE(e) ⇐⇒h(e) ∈Fx1 · Fx2
⇐⇒∃a ∈Fx1 with a\h(e) ∈Fx2
⇐⇒∃e′ ∈E with h(e′) ∈Fx1 and h(e′\e) ∈Fx2
⇐⇒∃e′ ∈E with e′ ∈h−1(Fx1) = Fϕ(x1) and e′\e ∈Fϕ(x2)
⇐⇒e ∈Fϕ(x1) · Fϕ(x2)
⇐⇒ϕ(x1) · ϕ(x2) ∈ηE(e)
□
While one can verify the correctness of the above proof as given, we note that
the result is much more transparent in the setting of canonical extensions. The
following example shows that the homomorphism dual to a Boolean-topological
algebra morphism need not preserve the residuation operations.
Example 3.20. Let A = {α, β} and let A∗be the free monoid over A, or equiva-
lently, the set of all words over A with the concatenation product. We denote by 1
the empty word. Then P(A∗) is a Boolean algebra with a full residuated family of
binary operations on it given as in discrete duality
K · L = {uv | u ∈K, v ∈L}
K\L = {u ∈A∗| K · {u} ⊆L}
L/K = {u ∈A∗| {u} · K ⊆L}.
For singleton sets, we will write u∗instead of {u}∗, we will write K · L as KL,
and K ∪L as K + L as is usual in the theory of formal languages. We write A+
for the free semigroup generated by A, that is, A+ = A∗−{1}. Let C be the
Boolean subalgebra of P(A∗) generated by the two languages α∗and β∗. Then
C is a Boolean residuation subalgebra of P(A∗) (though it is not closed under the
forward operation ·). The dual space of C has four elements, which may be identiﬁed
with the four atoms of C, namely y1 = {1}, yα = α+, consisting of all non-empty
words in the single letter α, yβ = β+, and y0 = (α∗+ β∗)c. Also, the relational
dual of the residuation on C is functional. In fact, it may be veriﬁed directly that

22
MAI GEHRKE
the dual of C is the discrete idempotent monoid on Y = {y1, yα, yβ, y0} in which
y1 is the identity element, y0 is absorbent, and yαyβ = yβyα = y0.
Similarly, let B be the Boolean residuation subalgebra of P({α}∗) with atoms
x1 = {1}, and xα = α+. Here too it may be veriﬁed that the dual of B is the
discrete idempotent monoid on X = {x1, xα} in which x1 is the identity element.
Observe that the map ϕ : X →Y given by x1 7→y1 and xα 7→yα is a Boolean-
topological monoid morphism. The dual of ϕ is a Boolean algebra homomorphism
h : C →B for which we have
h(β∗\α∗) = h(∅) = ∅̸= α∗= {1}\α∗= h(β∗)\h(α∗).
As we will see in the next subsection though, the dual of a surjective Priestley
topological algebra morphism does preserve residuation. This fact, in conjunction
with Theorem 3.19 allows us to give a nice dual characterization of Priestley topo-
logical algebra quotients.
3.4. Residuation ideals and quotients of Boolean-topological algebras. In
this subsection we will identify which distributive sublattices of the dual of a Priest-
ley topological algebra correspond to its Priestley topological algebra quotients.
That is, we give a characterization among all sublattices, not just among sublat-
tices with a residuation algebra structure already known to preserve joins at primes.
To solve this problem, we will show, ﬁrst of all, that, in the case of a surjective
Priestley topological morphism, the dual map preserves the residuation operations.
The main result of this subsection is the duality-theoretic cornerstone of the clas-
sical Eilenberg-Reiterman theory.
Proposition 3.21. Let X and Y be Priestley topological algebras of type τ, and let
D and E be the dual residuation algebras, respectively. If ϕ : X →Y is a surjective
morphism of Priestley topological algebras of type τ, then the dual of ϕ embeds E
in D as a residuation subalgebra of type τ.
Proof. Let f be a basic operation symbol of the type τ. Assume f is binary. Let \
and / be the residual operations dual to f. We show that the dual h : E →D of ϕ
preserves \. The proof for / and for operations of higher arity is similar.
Since ϕ preserves f, we are in the situation of Theorem 3.19. Therefore, as we
saw in the proof of that theorem, we have, for a ∈D and e ∈E
ηD(a\h(e)) =
[
{ηD(h(e′\e)) | e′ ∈E and a ⩽h(e′)}.
Thus, for e1, e2 ∈E we have
ηD(h(e1)\h(e2)) =
[
{ηD(h(e′\e2)) | e′ ∈E and h(e1) ⩽h(e′)}.
Since ϕ is surjective, by duality, h is injective, and thus we have h(e1) ⩽h(e′) if
and only if e1 ⩽e′, and when e1 ⩽e′ then e′\e2 ⩽e1\e2 and thus the collection
that we take the union of above has a largest element so that
ηD(h(e1)\h(e2)) = ηD(h(e1\e2))
or equivalently h(e1)\h(e2) = h(e1\e2) as required.
□
As Example 3.20 at the end of the previous subsection showed, the surjectivity
is essential in the above proposition. In the surjective setting, we get a dual map
which is a residuation algebra morphism. This is a stronger property than the one
given in Proposition 3.18 for duals of maps between Boolean-topological algebras.

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION
23
We now give an example showing that being a Boolean residuation subalgebra is
not suﬃcient for the dual to be a Boolean-topological algebra quotient.
Example 3.22. Let B be the Boolean residuation subalgebra of P(α∗) generated
by L0 = (α3)∗, L1 = (α3)∗α, and L2 = (α3)∗α2. Then the dual of B is based on
X = {L0, L1, L2} and is isomorphic to the additive group Z/3Z (with the operation
as on the subscripts). Now let C be the subalgebra of B with elements ∅, L0, Lc
0,
and α∗. Then C is closed under residuation but it is not a residuation ideal of
B since L1\L0 = L2 ̸∈C. One can check that the dual of C is the two element
discrete space Y = {L0, Lc
0} with the ternary relation
R
L0
Lc
0
L0
L0
Lc

Lc

Lc
0
L0, Lc

That is, R(Lc
0, Lc
0, L0) and R(Lc
0, Lc
0, Lc
0) so that R is not functional. Note that C
is a Boolean residuation subalgebra but the embedding of C in B does not satisfy
the equivalent conditions of Theorem 3.19 and the residuation algebra C does not
preserves joins at primes.
Deﬁnition 3.23. Let B be a residuation algebra.
We call a subset C of B a
residuation ideal of B provided
(1) C is a bounded sublattice of B;
(2) for all c ∈C and b ∈B : c/b ∈C and b\c ∈C.
A Boolean residuation ideal of B is a residuation ideal that is a Boolean algebra.
As we saw in Section 2.3 bounded sublattices of a bounded distributive lattice
correspond to compatible quasiorders on the dual space. Furthermore we saw in
Section 2.4 that the additional operations of a residuation algebra correspond to
relations on the dual space. It will turn out that the compatible quasiorders corre-
sponding to residuation ideals are exactly those that are relational congruences for
the corresponding relations in the following sense.
Deﬁnition 3.24. Let X be an extended Priestley space and ≼a compatible qua-
siorder on X. We say that ≼is a relational congruence on X provided for each
basic (n + 1)-ary relation R on X and for all x1, . . . , xn, x′
1, . . . , x′
n, z ∈X we have
[x′
1 ≽x1, . . . , x′
n ≽xn and R(x1, . . . , xn, z)] =⇒∃z′ [R(x′
1, . . . , x′
n, z′) and z′ ≽z].
The following correspondence theorem, in the setting of functional relations, is
the main technical result behind [25, Theorem 7.2]. In essentially as general a form
as given here, it is due to Mirte Dekkers and was ﬁrst proved in her Master’s Thesis
[18].
Theorem 3.25. Let B be a residuation algebra and C a bounded sublattice of B.
Furthermore let X be the extended dual space of B and ≼the compatible quasiorder
on X corresponding to C. Then C is a residuation ideal of B if and only if the
quasiorder ≼is a relational congruence on X.
Note that the setting here is more general than in Theorem 3.19 since we do not
assume that residuation preserves joins at primes, that is, that the relations on the
space are functional.

24
MAI GEHRKE
Proof. We just prove the theorem for a single binary operation. Suppose that C
is a residuation ideal of B and let x, x′, y, y′, z ∈X with R(x, y, z), x ≼x′, and
y ≼y′. Then Fx · Fy ⩾Fz, Fx′ ∩C ⊆Fx, Ix ∩C ⊆Ix′, and similarly for the y’s.
Now let F = Fx′ · Fy′ and I = ↓(Iz ∩C) where the down-set is taken in B. Then
F is a ﬁlter of B and I is an ideal of B. We claim that F and I are disjoint.
To this end, suppose a ∈F and c ∈C with a ⩽c. Since a ∈F there is b ∈Fx′
with b\a ∈Fy′. Now a ⩽c implies b\a ⩽b\c and thus b\c ∈Fy′. Also, as C is a
residuation ideal b\c ∈C and thus b\c ∈Fy′ ∩C ⊆Fy. Since the maps c/( ), ( )\c
form a Galois connection, we have
b\c = (c/(b\c))\c and b ⩽c/(b\c).
Thus we have (c/(b\c))\c ∈Fy and c/(b\c) ∈Fx′ ∩C ⊆Fx so that c ∈Fx · Fy.
Now since Fx · Fy ⩾Fz, it follows that c ∈Fz and thus c ̸∈Iz. That is, F and I
are disjoint.
Finally, by the Prime Filter Theorem, we obtain z′ ∈X with F ⊆Fz′ and
I ∩Fz′ = ∅. It follows that Iz ∩C ⊆Iz′ and thus z ≼z′. Also F ⊆Fz′ so that
Fx′ · Fy′ ⩾Fz′ and thus R(x′, y′, z′).
For the converse, suppose ≼is a relational congruence. We want to show that
C = {c ∈B | ∀y, y′ (y ≼y′ =⇒(c ∈Fy′ =⇒c ∈Fy))}
= {c ∈B | ∀y, y′ (y ≼y′ =⇒(c ∈Iy =⇒c ∈Iy′))}
is a residuation ideal of B. To this end, let c ∈C, b ∈B, and y, y′ ∈X with y ≼y′
and b\c ∈Iy. Using the fact that b\c = (R[ηB(b), , (ηB(c))c])c, we see that
b\c ∈Iy
⇐⇒
∃x, z ∈X [R(x, y, z) and b ∈Fx and c ∈Iz].
Thus we may pick x, z ∈X with R(x, y, z), b ∈Fx, and c ∈Iz. Now since y ≼y′ it
follows from the fact that ≼is a relational congruence that there exists z′ ∈X with
R(x, y′, z′) and z′ ≽z. From z′ ≽z we obtain Iz ∩C ⊆Iz′ and thus c ∈Iz′. In all
we have R(x, y′, z′) and b ∈Fx and c ∈Iz′ so that b\c ∈Iy′ as desired. Similarly
we can prove that c/b ∈C for all c ∈C, b ∈B.
□
Restricting to the setting where the original space has functional relations we see
more clearly why relational congruence is the right name for the concept introduced
in Deﬁnition 3.24.
Lemma 3.26. Let X be a Priestley space, R a compatible functional relation with
corresponding operation f : Xn →X. Further let ≼be a compatible quasiorder on
X. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(1) ≼is a relational congruence for R;
(2) For all x, x ′ ∈Xn
(x ≼x ′
=⇒
f(x) ≼f(x ′)).
Proof. Assume (1) and let x, x ′ ∈Xn with xi ≼x′
i for each i ∈{1, . . ., n}. Since
R is functional with corresponding operation f, we have R(x, f(x)).
Thus, by
(1), there is z′ ∈X with f(x) ≼z′ and R(x ′, z′). Therefore, again because R is
functional with corresponding operation f, it follows that z′ ⩽f(x ′). Now, since
≼extends ⩽and is transitive we have f(x) ≼f(x ′) as required.
For the converse, suppose x, x ′ ∈Xn with xi ≼x′
i for each i ∈{1, . . ., n} and
that R(x, z). Then z ⩽f(x). Also, by (2), f(x) ≼f(x ′), and thus z ≼f(x ′).
Let z′ = f(x ′), then R(x ′, z′) since R is functional with corresponding function f.
Also z ≼z′, so (1) is satisﬁed.

Now we just need an order theoretic and a topological generality, respectively,
to be able to interpret Theorem 3.19 in terms of quotients of Priestley topological
algebras.
Lemma 3.27. Let X be a poset, ≼be a quasiorder on X extending the order on
X, and let ≡= ≼∩≽be the equivalence relation corresponding to ≼. Further, let
f : Xn →X be an order preserving operation on X. Then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(1) For all x, x ′ ∈Xn
(x ≼x ′
=⇒
f(x) ≼f(x ′));
(2) ≡is a congruence for f and the quotient operation f/≡: (X/≡)n →X/≡
is order preserving.
Proof. This equivalence is a straight forward veriﬁcation using the fact that the
order on the quotient satisﬁes
x/≡⩽y/≡
⇐⇒
x ≼y.
□
Lemma 3.28. Let X be a compact space and f : Xn →X continuous. If q :
X ։ Y is a Hausdorﬀquotient of X whose kernel is a congruence for f, then the
quotient operation f/≡: Y n →Y is continuous.
Proof. We have the following diagram:
X
Xn
Y
Y n
f
qn
q
g
where g = f/≡is the operation on the quotient given by f. It suﬃces to show
that g−1(C) is closed whenever C is closed in Y . For C is closed in Y , the set
f −1(q−1(C)) is closed in Xn by continuity of q and f. Also, since Xn is com-
pact and Y is Hausdorﬀ, qn is a closed mapping and thus qn(f −1(q−1(C))) is
closed in Y n. However, since qn is surjective and the diagram commutes, we have
qn(f −1(q−1(C))) = qn((qn)−1(g−1(C))) = g−1(C).
□
As a consequence we obtain a dual characterization of the quotients of a Priestley
topological algebra.
Theorem 3.29. Let X be a Priestley topological algebra. Then the Priestley topo-
logical algebra quotients of X are in one-to-one correspondence with the residuation
ideals of the residuation algebra B dual to X.
Apart from being important in applications, this theorem also allows us to char-
acterize the duals of Priestley topological algebras.
Corollary 3.30. Let τ be an operational type.
Priestley topological algebras of
type τ are, up to isomorphism, precisely the extended Priestley duals of residuation
algebras that embed as residuation ideals in Boolean residuation algebras of type τ
for which residuation is join preserving at primes.

26
MAI GEHRKE
Proof. Suppose the dual of X embeds as a residuation ideal in a Boolean residu-
ation algebra of type τ for which residuation is join preserving at primes. Since
residuation in the Boolean residuation algebra is join preserving at primes, by The-
orem 3.17, its dual, Y , is a Boolean-topological algebra of type τ. Furthermore,
since the dual of X embeds as residuation ideal in the dual of Y , by Theorem 3.29
above, X is a Priestley topological algebra quotient of Y and thus in particular it
is a Priestley topological algebra.
Conversely, if X is a Priestley topological algebra, then forgetting the order on
the space yields a Boolean-topological algebra, X−. Also, since the Priestley order
on X is a compatible (quasi)order on X−(see Remark 2.9), it follows that the
identity map id : X−→X is a Priestley topological algebra quotient map. By
Theorem 3.29, this implies that the dual of X embeds as a residuation ideal in the
dual of X−, which, by Theorem 3.17, is a Boolean residuation algebra for which
residuation is join preserving at primes.

4. Profinite algebras and applications
The applications of topological algebra in automata theory and ﬁnite model
theory, as well as in many parts of classical algebra, are mainly concerned with
proﬁnite algebras. In this section we restrict our attention to these. First, we give
a characterization of the Boolean residuation algebras dual to proﬁnite algebras.
Next we consider the further special case of proﬁnite completions. We show that
the residuation algebra dual to the proﬁnite completion of a (discrete) algebra is the
Boolean residuation algebra of recognizable subsets of the original algebra. Finally
we show how the generalization of the composition of Eilenberg’s and Reiterman’s
theorem obtained in [25] is a special case of the duality between sublattices of a
bounded distributive lattice and quotients of its dual space.
4.1. Dual characterization of proﬁnite algebras. In this section we charac-
terize the Boolean residuation algebras dual to proﬁnite algebras. We illustrate the
use of this characterization by giving a simple proof of the fact that any Boolean-
topological algebra quotient of a proﬁnite algebra is again proﬁnite.
Let X be a topological algebra of type τ. By deﬁnition, X is proﬁnite provided
there is a family {Xi} of ﬁnite τ-algebras indexed by a directed set I and τ-algebra
morphisms fij : Xi →Xj for i ⩾j, so that fjk ◦fij = fik whenever i ⩾j ⩾k
and X = lim
←−(Xi, fij). If X is proﬁnite, then, by the standard construction of the
inverse limit, X embeds in the product of the Xi and the inverse images of subsets
of Xi under the inverse limit maps fi : X →Xi, where i ranges over all elements
of I, form a basis for the topology of X. Thus X is in fact a Boolean-topological
algebra. For more details on inverse limits, see [12, Sections I.4 and I.6]. Since X is
a Boolean-topological algebra, by Theorem 3.17, it follows that X is the extended
Stone dual of a Boolean residuation algebra B of type τ. Furthermore, without
loss of generality, we may assume that all the maps fij are surjective and thus
that each Xi is a topological quotient algebra of X. That is, by Theorem 3.17 and
Theorem 3.29, X is a proﬁnite topological algebra if and only if there is a directed
family {Bi} of ﬁnite Boolean residuation ideals of B such that B = S Bi. But this
in turn is clearly equivalent to ﬁnitely generated Boolean residuation ideals of B
being ﬁnite.

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION
27
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let B be a Boolean residuation algebra. We say that B is locally
ﬁnite with respect to residuation ideals provided each ﬁnite subset of B generates
a ﬁnite Boolean residuation ideal in B.
We now have the following characterization of proﬁnite topological algebras
among Boolean-topological algebras.
Theorem 4.2. A Boolean-topological algebra is proﬁnite if and only if the dual
residuation algebra is locally ﬁnite with respect to residuation ideals.
While it is straight forward to see that products and subobjects of proﬁnite
algebras are again proﬁnite, the case of quotient is less obvious. However, using the
above duality result, closure under Boolean-topological quotient algebras becomes
an easy consequence.
Theorem 4.3. Any Boolean-topological algebra quotient of a proﬁnite algebra is
again proﬁnite.
Proof. Let X be a proﬁnite algebra. That is, the dual residuation algebra B is
locally ﬁnite with respect to residuation ideals. Now let X ։ Y be a Boolean-
topological algebra quotient of X. Then Y is the extended dual of some Boolean
residuation algebra A and the dual of the quotient map X ։ Y is an embedding
A ֒→B of A in B as a Boolean residuation ideal of B. Since B is locally ﬁnite with
respect to residuation ideals so is A and thus Y is also proﬁnite.
□
4.2. Proﬁnite completions and recognizable subsets of an algebra. We
now consider a further restricted class of topological algebras, namely, proﬁnite
completions of (discrete) abstract algebras.
Let A be an algebra of some type τ. The proﬁnite completion of A is by deﬁnition
the reﬂection of A in the category of proﬁnite algebras of type τ. Let Conω(A)
denote the set of all congruences θ of A of ﬁnite index (i.e. for which the quotient
algebra A/θ is ﬁnite). Note that if Conω(A) is ordered by reverse inclusion then
it is directed since the intersection of two congruences of ﬁnite index is again a
congruence of ﬁnite index. Thus we obtain an inverse limit system, FA, indexed by
Conω(A) as follows:
(1) For each θ ∈Conω(A) we have the ﬁnite algebra A/θ;
(2) Whenever θ ⊆ψ we have a (unique) homomorphism A/θ →A/ψ which
commutes with the quotient maps qθ : A →A/θ and qψ : A →A/ψ and
thus the maps of the system also commute with each other as required.
The inverse limit system FA
A/ϕ
A/θ
A/ψ
A
One can show that the inverse limit of this system in the category of topological
algebras, bA = lim
←−FA is the proﬁnite completion of the algebra A.
Dualising the objects and maps of the system FA, we obtain a direct limit system
GA of ﬁnite Boolean residuation subalgebras of type τ of P(A) with maps that are

28
MAI GEHRKE
embeddings as residuation ideals.
The direct limit system GA
P(A/ϕ)
P(A/θ)
P(A/ψ)
P(A)
The direct limit of this system among Boolean residuation algebras of type τ is
the union of the images of the embeddings q−1
θ
: P(A/θ) ֒→P(A). The Boolean
algebra underlying this union is a fundamental and much studied object in theo-
retical computer science, namely the Boolean algebra of recognizable subsets of the
algebra A. We give the standard deﬁnitions: Given a homomorphism ϕ : A →F
into a ﬁnite algebra F, a subset L ⊆A is said to be recognized by ϕ provided there
is a subset P ⊆F with L = ϕ−1(P), or equivalently if L = ϕ−1(ϕ[L]). A subset
L ⊆A is said to be recognized by F provided there is a homomorphism ϕ : A →F
which recognizes L, and ﬁnally L is said to be recognizable provided there is a ﬁnite
algebra F such that L is recognized by F. We denote the Boolean algebra of all
recognizable subsets of A by Rec(A). We have:
Rec(A) = {ϕ−1(P) | ϕ : A →F ⊇P, ϕ a homomorphism, and F ﬁnite}
=
[
{q−1
θ (P(A/θ)) | θ ∈Conω(A)}
= lim
−→{P(A/θ)}θ∈Conω(A).
We would now like to conclude that the extended Stone dual of the Boolean resid-
uation algebra Rec(A) is the proﬁnite completion bA. However, at this point the
categories we are taking limits in do not quite match across the duality. So either we
need to show that residuation in Rec(A) preserves joins at primes in order to show
that it is in the category dual to proﬁnite algebras or we need to show that bA is the
inverse limit of the system FA in the bigger category of extended Boolean spaces
dual to Boolean residuation algebras of type τ. One can verify the former. This is
the content of [22, Proposition 8]. Here we opt for the latter as it is conceptually
more informative and it is an interesting fact in its own right that inverse limits in
the category of extended Boolean Stone duals of any arity are given by the familiar
product construction as in proﬁnite algebras. The proof of the following theorem
is a bit lengthy but follows the classical style arguments about inverse limits in
compact spaces.
Theorem 4.4. Let τ be a type of extended Boolean spaces. Inverse limits in the
category of extended Boolean spaces of type τ are given as in the category of topo-
logical spaces with the additional relations deﬁned coordinate-wise.
Proof. Let {Xi}i∈I be an inverse limit system of extended Boolean spaces of type
τ with corresponding bounded morphisms fij : Xi →Xj whenever i ⩾j. Let X
be the inverse limit of the underlying Boolean spaces of the {Xi}i∈I. That is, X
consists of those x ∈Πi∈IXi such that fij(xi) = xj whenever i ⩾j. It is straight
forward to verify that X is a closed subspace of Πi∈IXi and thus a Boolean space.
It is well known to be the inverse limit in the larger category of compact Hausdorﬀ

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION
29
spaces and thus it is the inverse limit of the underlying Boolean spaces of the
{Xi}i∈I in the category of Boolean spaces. Suppose the type τ includes a relation
symbol R of arity n and that the mth coordinate is the codomain coordinate. That
is, the spaces Y in the category satisfy
(1) For each y ∈Y the set R[ , y, ] is closed (where y occurs in the mth
coordinate);
(2) For all U1, . . . , Um−1 and Vm+1, . . . , Vn clopen subsets of Y , the set R[U, , V ]
is clopen,
and bounded morphisms satisfy the (Back) condition for the mth coordinate as
well as the (Forth) condition. See Deﬁnition 2.10 and Deﬁnition 2.11 where the
conditions are given for the more general extended Priestley space setting. Now,
we deﬁne the relation on X coordinate-wise as in the algebraic setting. That is,
for (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Xn we have RX(x1, . . . , xn) if and only if Ri(x1i, . . . , xni) for
each i ∈I where Ri is the interpretation of R in the space Xi and xki is the ith
coordinate of xk. We need to show that the inverse limit maps fi : X →Xi, which
are just the restriction to X of the projections πi : Πj∈IXj →Xi for i ∈I, are
bounded morphisms. For this purpose, ﬁx i ∈I. We show that fi is a bounded
morphism.
Clearly, if RX(x1, . . . , xn) then Ri(x1i, . . . , xni) so that the (Forth)
condition holds.
Now, to ease the notation and without loss of generality, we
assume that m = 1. Suppose further that Ri(fi(x1), x2i, . . . , xni) where x1 ∈X
and (x2i, . . . , xni) ∈Xn−1
i
. We want to show that there exist (x2, . . . , xn) ∈Xn−1
with RX(x1, x2, . . . , xn) and fi(xk) = xki for each k ∈{2, . . . , n}. Deﬁne for each
ﬁnite subset M of I containing i, the set SM ⊆(Πj∈IXj)n−1 consisting of those
(z2, . . . , zn) satisfying the following properties
(1) πi(zk) = xki for each k ∈{2, . . . , n};
(2) fjj′(πj(zk)) = πj′(zk) for each j, j′ ∈M with j ⩾j′ and k ∈{2, . . . , n};
(3) Rj(fj(x1), πj(z2), . . . , πj(zn)) for each j ∈M.
Since all the functions involved are continuous and the Rjs are closed relations, it
follows that each SM is a closed subset of (Πj∈IXj)n−1. We show that each SM
is non-empty. Since M is ﬁnite and I is directed, there is l ∈I with l ⩾j for all
j ∈M. Now since fli : Xl →Xi is a bounded morphism, fi(x1) = fli(fl(x1)),
and Ri(fi(x1), x2i, . . . , xni), there are z2l, . . . , znl ∈Xl with Rl(fl(x1), z2l, . . . , znl)
and fli(zkl) = xki for each k ∈{2, . . . , n}. Now any (z2, . . . , zn) ∈(Πj∈IXj)n−1
satisfying
πj(zk) = flj(zkl)
for each j ∈M is in SM. So SM is non-empty. Further, it is clear that if M ⊇M ′
then SM ⊆S′
M so that the collection {SM | i ∈M ⊆I, M ﬁnite} has the Finite
Intersection Property. Thus, by compactness of (Πj∈IXj)n−1, the intersection of
all the SM’s is non-empty and for any (x2, . . . , xn) in this intersection, we have
by item (2) above that (x2, . . . , xn) ∈Xn−1.
Also, by item (3), we have that
Rj(fj(x1), fj(x2), . . . , fj(xn)) for all j ∈I and thus RX(x1, x2, . . . , xn). Finally, by
(1), we have fi(xk) = xki for each k ∈{2, . . ., n}. That is, we have proved that fi
is a bounded morphism.
In order to complete the proof of the fact that X with the fi’s is the inverse limit
of the given system, we need to show that for any extended Boolean space, Y , of type
τ with bounded morphisms gi : Y →Xi for i ∈I such that fij ◦gi = gj whenever
i ⩾j, the unique continuous map g : Y →X given by g(y) = (gi(y))i∈I is a bounded

30
MAI GEHRKE
morphism. First note that if RY (y1, . . . , yn), then as each gi is a bounded morphism
we have Ri(gi(y1), . . . , gi(yn)) for each i ∈I, and thus RX(g(y1), . . . , g(yn)). That
is, g satisﬁes the (Forth) condition. Now, again we assume that m = 1 to ease
notation. Let y1 ∈Y and (x2, . . . , xn) ∈Xn−1 with RX(g(y1), x2, . . . , xn). Let
M ⊆I be ﬁnite, then there is i ∈I with i ⩾j for each j ∈M. Now since gi
is a bounded morphism there are (z2, . . . , zn) ∈Y n−1 so that gi(zk) = xki for
2 ⩽k ⩽n and RY (y1, z2, . . . , zn). For each j ∈M and k ∈{2, . . ., n} we have
gj(zk) = fij(gi(zk)) = fij(xki) = xkj. So each set
SM = {(z2, . . . , zn) ∈Y n−1 | RY (y1, z2, . . . , zn)
and gj(zk) = xkj whenever 2 ⩽k ⩽n and j ∈M}
is non-empty. Also, each SM is closed and the collection of all SM’s for M ⊆I ﬁnite
has the Finite Intersection Property. Any (y2, . . . , yn) ∈T{SM | M ⊆I ﬁnite}
satisﬁes RY (y1, y2, . . . , yn) and g(zk) = xk for each k ∈{2, . . ., n}. That is, we
have proved that g is a bounded morphism as required.
□
The following theorem now follows from the elementary fact that the systems
FA and GA are dual to each other under extended Stone duality.
Theorem 4.5. Let A be an abstract algebra. The proﬁnite completion bA is homeo-
morphic as a topological algebra to the extended Stone dual of Rec(A), the Boolean
algebra with residuation operations of recognizable subsets of A.
The above theorem, in the case of a ﬁnitely generated free monoid, is one of
the main results of [25], cf. Theorem 6.1. Proﬁnite methods have been studied
extensively in connection with automata theory including the connection between
recognizable subsets and proﬁnite completions as algebras of implicit operations
[2]. The fact that the Boolean algebra of recognizable sets is dual in basic Stone
duality to the underlying Stone space of the proﬁnite completion is well known [2]
and was used explicitly by Pippenger in [44]. However, the methods of Pippenger’s
paper were not adopted by others in the area. Most applications using proﬁnite
completions of algebras make very essential use of the algebraic operations so that
capturing these is essential for the duality to be useful in situations where proﬁnite
completions are applied and this is new to the work [25] for which the present paper
gives the more complete duality theoretic point of view. The work [50, Section 8.4]
is similar in spirit to our work here in that it captures proﬁnite semigroups by
dual structures. However, it exploits the connection between Boolean spaces and
Boolean rings rather than Boolean lattices and thus goes in the direction of ring
theory rather than lattice theory. Another diﬀerence is that in the approach of
Rhodes and Steinberg, the dual structure is a bi-algebra rather than an algebra:
An algebraic operation f : Xn →X on a dual space most directly is dualized in
Stone duality as a Boolean algebra or lattice homomorphism h : B →Ln
i=1 Bi
into the coproduct of n copies of the dual lattice B. This is naturally co-algebraic
structure on B rather than algebraic structure on B. The purpose of the current
paper is to explore the less obvious fact that continuous algebraic operations on
dual spaces can actually be captured by purely algebraic structure on the dual
Boolean algebras. However, exploring the co-algebraic approach in the setting of
Stone and Priestley duality seems an interesting direction for further work.

4.3. Proﬁnite term operations. As is fundamental in universal algebra, the el-
ements of a free algebra over a ﬁnite set3 A of variables may be seen as terms
yielding |A|-ary term functions on all algebras of the appropriate type. The inter-
est of the proﬁnite completion of such a free algebra is that its elements may be seen
as generalized terms yielding so-called proﬁnite |A|-ary term functions on all ﬁnite
algebras of the appropriate type. This is usually shown using uniform continuity.
Here we explain this phenomenon from a duality theoretic point of view that does
not appeal to uniform continuity but uses a double dual construction consisting in
applying the extended discrete duality of Section 2.1 ﬁrst and then the extended
Stone duality (after appropriate restriction of the codomain).
Consider a ﬁxed algebra type τ and let V be a variety (i.e., an equational class)
of algebras of type τ. Let A be a ﬁnite alphabet, and FV(A), the free V-algebra
freely generated by A. As we saw in Theorem 4.5 above, the Boolean residuation
algebra Rec(FV(A)) is the extended Stone dual of the proﬁnite completion \
FV(A) of
FV(A). We want to show that, given a ﬁnite algebra B of type τ, every x ∈\
FV(A)
yields a function xB :
BA
−→
B, which is then the proﬁnite term function
on B induced by x. That is, for every ﬁnite V-algebra, B, we want to deﬁne an
assignment
( )B : \
FV(A) −→F(BA, B)
x
7→
xB :
BA −→B
(ba)a∈A 7→xB((ba)a∈A),
where F(BA, B) is the set of functions from BA to B, that is, the set of |A|-ary
operations on the ﬁnite algebra B. To this end, note that each tuple (ba)a∈A ∈BA
is a function
ϕ : A −→B
a 7→ba.
By freeness of FV(A) it has a unique extension to a homomorphism
F(ϕ) : FV(A) →B.
Consider the corresponding surjective homomorphism F(ϕ) : FV(A) →B′ where
B′ = Im(F(ϕ)). The dual of this map under the discrete duality is a complete
Boolean algebra embedding that embeds P(B′) as a residuation ideal in P(FV(A))
(F(ϕ))−1 : P(B′) ֒→P(FV(A)).
However, by the deﬁnition of recognizable subset, the image of this map falls entirely
within Rec(FV(A)). That is, (F(ϕ))−1 : P(B′) ֒→Rec(FV(A)). Denote the Stone
duality functor from the category of Boolean algebras to the category of Boolean
spaces by S. Applying it we obtain
S((F(ϕ))−1) : \
FV(A) →S(P(B′))
and by Theorem 3.29 we conclude that this map is a topological algebra quotient.
Finally, since B is ﬁnite so is B′ and the discrete and the Stone dualities agree and
3We use A rather than X or V in line with traditions in automata and languages where an
alphabet A plays the role of the set of variables.

32
MAI GEHRKE
S(P(B′)) is, up to natural isomorphism, just B′ so that
S((F(ϕ))−1) : \
FV(A) →B′ ֒→B
is the (unique by density) topological algebra homomorphism extending F(ϕ). We
deﬁne the term-function associated to x ∈\
FV(A) to be the |A|-ary operation given
by:
xB : BA −→B
ϕ
7→
S((F(ϕ))−1)(x).
Remark 4.6. Once the map ϕ into a ﬁnite algebra B as above is extended to a
homomorphism from the free algebra to B, the rest of the extension works for
arbitrary algebras. That is, if A now is an algebra, rather than a generating set
for one, and ϕ : A →B is a homomorphism, rather than just a set map, then
taking B′ = Im(ϕ), the map ϕ−1 : P(B′) →Rec(A) is an embedding of a Boolean
residuation ideal and thus the extended Stone dual map S(ϕ−1) : bA →B′ ֒→B
is a topological algebra map extending ϕ in the sense that ϕ = S(ϕ−1) ◦e where
e : A →bA is the canonical injection. We will denote this (unique) topological
algebra map extending ϕ : A →B by bϕ : bA →B.
4.4. Sublattices and equational theories. In universal algebra, Birkhoﬀ’s va-
riety theorem states that classes of algebras closed under homomorphic images,
subalgebras, and products are precisely those that are model classes of equational
theories. In ﬁnite model theory, Reiterman’s theorem [49] does the same for classes
of ﬁnite algebras: the classes of ﬁnite algebras closed under homomorphic images,
subalgebras, and ﬁnite products are precisely those that are model classes of proﬁ-
nite equational theories.
In the setting of monoids, Eilenberg’s theorem relates
certain classes of recognizable languages with classes of ﬁnite monoids closed under
homomorphic images, subalgebras, and ﬁnite products. The Eilenberg-Reiterman
combination thus relates certain classes of recognizable languages with proﬁnite
equational theories. This combination is a central tool in automata theory, where
it is often used to obtain the decidability of classes of recognizable languages. For
this reason, there are generalizations in various directions that relax one or more
of the requirements on the classes of languages to which the theory applies, e.g.
[40, 43, 44, 45, 21, 55, 36].
In [25], it was shown that the Eilenberg-Reiterman combination is in fact a
special instance of the Stone duality between sublattices and quotient spaces, thus
providing a common generalization in which only closure under intersection and
union is required for the classes of languages and duality for other closure properties
accounts for the many earlier generalizations of Eilenberg-Reiterman theorems in a
completely modular manner4. In particular, the direct duality route from lattices
of languages to (proﬁnite) equational theories is available also when the classes of
ﬁnite algebras in the middle are not. The relationship between the three types of
4The theorem of [36] does not follow as it only requires a semilattice (along with other require-
ments). Encompassing this result would require generalizing [25] using duality for distributive
meet or join semilattices [6].

(3) extended Priestley duality
In this section we start from Theorem 2.8 applied in the special case of a Boolean
algebra of recognizable subset of an abstract algebra A, and then we specialize in a
modular way down to the case of the (composition) of the classical Eilenberg and
Reiterman theorems. We ﬁx an algebraic type τ and, for now, also an algebra A
of this type. We are interested in Rec(A), the lattice (or actually Boolean algebra)
of recognizable subsets of A and its sublattices. A fundamental part of duality
is that the subobjects of an object on one side of a duality correspond to the
quotient objects of the dual object. As we have seen in Theorem 4.5, the dual
space of Rec(A), as a Boolean residuation algebra, is the proﬁnite completion, bA,
as a topological algebra. In a ﬁrst tempo, we forget the algebraic structure on both
of these objects, and we simply have a Boolean algebra and its dual Stone space.
Applying Theorem 2.8, we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 4.7. Let A be an abstract algebra, Rec(A) the Boolean algebra of its
recognizable subsets, and bA its proﬁnite completion. The assignments
Σ 7→CΣ = {L ∈Rec(A) | ∀(x, y) ∈Σ (L ∈Fy ⇒L ∈Fx)}
for Σ ⊆bA × bA and
K 7→≼K= {(x, y) ∈bA × bA | ∀L ∈K (L ∈Fy ⇒L ∈Fx)}
for K ⊆Rec(A) establish a Galois connection whose Galois closed sets are the
compatible quasiorders on bA and the bounded sublattices of Rec(A), respectively.
Here we want to understand a pair (x, y) ∈bA × bA as a kind of equation. At
this most general level, our concept of equation is more akin to a relation between
generators. We make the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.8. Let A be an abstract algebra. A proﬁnite lattice equation for A
is given by a pair of elements x, y ∈bA and is denoted by x →y. The equation,
x →y, is said to be satisﬁed by L ∈Rec(A) if and only if L ∈Fy implies L ∈Fx.
That is, x →y is satisﬁed by L if and only if L ∈C{(x,y)} as deﬁned by the Galois
connection in Theorem 4.7.
With this nomenclature, we see that the Galois connection in Theorem 4.7 is
that between model classes and theories. That is, a set Σ ⊆bA × bA is a set of
equations and CΣ is the set of all models of Σ while a set K ⊆Rec(A) is a set of
models and ≼K is the theory of K. Further, the fact that the Galois closed sets of
recognizable sets are exactly the lattices of recognizable sets becomes the following
general Eilenberg-Reiterman theorem.
Corollary 4.9. Let A be any algebra. A collection of recognizable subsets of A is
a sublattice of Rec(A) if and only if it can be deﬁned by a set of proﬁnite lattice
equations for A.

34
MAI GEHRKE
Noting that Boolean subalgebras of Rec(A) are exactly those for which the cor-
responding compatible quasiorder is an equivalence relation and writing x ↔y for
the conjunction x →y and y →x, we get an equational description of the Boolean
subalgebras of recognizable subsets. We call such x ↔y proﬁnite symmetric lattice
equations.
Corollary 4.10. Let A be any algebra. A collection of recognizable subsets of A is
a Boolean subalgebra of Rec(A) if and only if it can be deﬁned by a set of symmetric
lattice equations for A.
The diﬀerence between the lattice case and the Boolean case is that we need an
order relation in the lattice setting as in Priestley duality. This fact was rediscovered
in the theory of formal languages and automata by Pin who introduced ordered
monoids and an asymmetric notion of proﬁnite identities [40] without realizing the
connection with Priestley duality.
In the original Eilenberg theorem, not only is it necessary that the collections
of recognizable sets be closed under Boolean complementation, they must also be
residuation ideals and be ‘closed under inverse images of morphisms’ (see Deﬁni-
tion 4.14 below). We now proceed to give Eilenberg-Reiterman theorems for each
of these conditions separately.
In order to treat residuation ideals, we need to recall the concept of linear unary
polynomial from universal algebra. We will apply it to the algebraic reduct of bA
for A an algebra of type τ. By deﬁnition, the unary polynomials over bA are the
terms in one variable of the type obtained by expanding τ with a nullary operation
symbol for each element of bA. The new symbols are then interpreted as themselves
in bA. Furthermore, a unary polynomial over bA is said to be linear provided the
variable occurs exactly once in the term. We will use the symbol □for the variable,
and denote the set of all unary linear polynomials over bA by Pol b
A
lin(□).
Each
p ∈Pol b
A
lin(□) yields a unary polynomial function p b
A : bA →bA as usual with
terms in universal algebra. The linear unary polynomials over an algebra are also
sometimes referred to as ‘contexts’ or ‘terms with a hole’.
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let A be an abstract algebra. A proﬁnite algebra equation for
A is given by a pair of elements x, y ∈bA and is denoted by x ⩽y. An equation,
x ⩽y, is said to be satisﬁed by L ∈Rec(A) if and only if p b
A(x) →p b
A(y) holds for
every p ∈Pol b
A
lin(□).
Theorem 4.12. Let A be any algebra. A collection of recognizable subsets of A is
a residuation ideal of Rec(A) if and only if it can be deﬁned by a set of proﬁnite
algebra equations for A.
Proof. If C is a residuation ideal of Rec(A), then by Theorem 3.25 the corresponding
compatible quasiorder ≼is a congruence on bA. But by Lemma 3.26, since the dual
relations on bA are functional, we have for each basic operation f of arity n and for
all x, x ′ ∈bAn
x ≼x ′
=⇒
f(x) ≼f(x ′).
(∗)
Now, take as set Σ of proﬁnite algebra equation all the equations x ⩽y such
that x ≼y. Then it is clear that if each equation in Σ holds for L, then L ∈C
since already each x →y for x ⩽y ∈Σ holding in L implies L ∈C by The-
orem 4.7.
Conversely, if x ≼y and f is an n-ary basic operation, 1 ⩽i ⩽n,

STONE DUALITY, TOPOLOGICAL ALGEBRA, AND RECOGNITION
35
and u1, . . . , ui−1, vi+1, . . . , vn ∈bA, then (u, x, v) ≼(u, y, v) and thus f(u, x, v) ≼
f(u, y, v) by (*).
Since the unary polynomials are built up inductively by ap-
plying the basic operations in this manner, we see that (*) implies that for each
p ∈Pol b
A
lin(□)
x ≼y =⇒p
b
A(x) ≼p
b
A(y)
That is, for x and y with x ≼y, the set of all x′ →y′ corresponding to x ⩽y is
contained in the set of pairs in ≼. It follows that x ⩽y holds for all L ∈C. That is,
if C is a residuation ideal in Rec(A) then it is deﬁned by the set Σ = {x ⩽y | x ≼y}.
For the converse, suppose L ∈Rec(A) satisﬁes the proﬁnite algebra equation
x ⩽y. We want to show that for any basic operation g of arity m of the type
and any j with 1 ⩽j ⩽m, the jth residual g♯
j applied to L in the numerator
coordinate and an arbitrary K ∈Rec(A)m−1 in the denominator coordinates yields
an element of Rec(A) which satisﬁes x ⩽y. We just argue in the case of a binary g
and m = 1. The proof for general g and m is similar but much more cumbersome
with respect to notation.
Let p ∈Pol b
A
lin(□), then we want to show that K\L
satisﬁes p b
A(x) →p b
A(y). So suppose K\L ∈Fp b
A(y). By duality this is the same
as p b
A(y) ∈η(K\L) where η = ηRec(A) : Rec(A) ֒→P( bA) is the Stone embedding.
But on the dual space bA, the residuation operations are given by the graph R of g.
That is, η(K\L) = (R[η(K), , (η(L)c]c and this operation on P( bA) has the lifting
of g to subsets as lower adjoint, so
{p
b
A(y)} ⊆(R[η(K), , (η(L)c]c ⇐⇒g(η(K), {p
b
A(y)}) ⊆η(L).
That is, for each w ∈η(K), we have
g(w, p
b
A(y)) ∈η(L).
Now, for each w ∈bA, the term with constants from bA given by qw(□) = g(w, p(□))
is again a linear unary polynomial over bA, and we have q b
A
w(y) ∈η(L) for each w ∈
η(K). Since L satisﬁes x ⩽y and q b
A
w(y) ∈η(L) is equivalent to L ∈Fq b
A
w(y), it follows
that L ∈Fq b
A
w(x) for each w ∈η(K). Going backwards in the equivalences used
above for y, we then obtain g(η(K), {p b
A(x)}) ⊆η(L) and ﬁnally p b
A(x) ∈η(K\L)
or K\L ∈Fp b
A(x). That is, we have shown that K\L satisﬁes p b
A(x) →p b
A(y) as
required.

Remark 4.13. These proﬁnite algebra equations are easier to describe in the case
of monoids, see [25]. There, for A a monoid and x, y ∈bA, the equation x ⩽y
was taken to mean that uxv →uyv holds for all u, v ∈bA. This is because each
unary linear polynomial over a monoid is equivalent to one of the form u□v for
some u, v ∈bA.
So far our equations are ‘local’ in the sense that they are not invariant under sub-
stitution. The last ingredient of the original Reiterman theorem is this invariance.
For this purpose we place ourselves within some ﬁxed variety V of abstract alge-
bras. A class of recognizable sets for V is an assignment A 7→C(A) for each ﬁnite
alphabet A, where C(A) ⊆Rec(FV(A)). We call such a class a lattice class provided
C(A) is a sublattice of Rec(FV(A)) for each ﬁnite alphabet A. Furthermore, a class
of equations for V is an assignment A 7→Σ(A) for each ﬁnite alphabet A, where

36
MAI GEHRKE
Σ(A) ⊆\
FV(A) × \
FV(A). We say that a class C is given by a class of equations Σ
provided, for each ﬁnite alphabet A, we have that C(A) is given by Σ(A). Thus
Corollary 4.9 tells us that a class of recognizable sets is a lattice class if and only if
it is given by some class of equations.
Notice that given ﬁnite alphabets A and B and a homomorphism σ : FV(A) →
FV(B), any recognizable subset L of FV(B) has an inverse image under σ which
is a recognizable subset of FV(A), where the recognizing morphism is the pre-
composition by σ of the recognizing homomorphism for L. That is, σ induces a
Boolean algebra homomorphism
Rec(σ) : Rec(FV(B)) →Rec(FV(A)), L 7→σ−1(L).
The Stone dual of this homomorphism is a continuous function
bσ : \
FV(A) →\
FV(B).
Since it extends σ, it is in fact also the unique continuous extension of σ.
Deﬁnition 4.14. A lattice class C of recognizable sets is said to be closed under
inverse images of morphisms provided, whenever A and B are ﬁnite alphabets and
σ : FV(A) →FV(B) is a homomorphism, then L ∈C(B) implies σ−1(L) ∈C(A).
A class Σ of equations is said to be closed under substitution provided, whenever
A and B are ﬁnite alphabets and σ : FV(A) →FV(B) is a homomorphism, then
x →y ∈Σ(A) implies bσ(x) →bσ(y) ∈Σ(B) .
Theorem 4.15. Let C be a lattice class of recognizable subsets of a variety V. Then
C is closed under inverse images of morphisms if and only if it is given by some
equational class which is closed under substitution.
Proof. Before we prove the theorem, it is worthwhile isolating the following fact: If
σ : FV(A) →FV(B) is a homomorphism, then Rec(σ) : Rec(FV(B)) →Rec(FV(A))
is a Boolean algebra homomorphism and bσ : \
FV(A) →\
FV(B) is the dual continuous
function. Now for L ∈Rec(FV(B)) and x ∈\
FV(A) we have
L ∈Fbσ(x) ⇐⇒bσ(x) ∈ηRec(FV(B))(L)
⇐⇒x ∈bσ−1(ηRec(FV(B))(L)) = ηRec(FV(B))(Rec(σ)(L))
⇐⇒Rec(σ)(L) ∈Fx.
Suppose C is a lattice class of recognizable sets closed under inverse images of mor-
phisms. Since C is a lattice class, it is given by the equational class Σ : A 7→≼C(A) as
deﬁned in Theorem 4.7. Let A and B be ﬁnite alphabets and σ : FV(A) →FV(B) a
homomorphism. Since C is closed under inverse morphisms, Rec(σ)(C(B)) ⊆C(A).
Let x →y be an equation in Σ(A) =≼C(A) and L ∈C(B), then Rec(σ)(L) satis-
ﬁes x →y. We want to show that L satisﬁes bσ(x) →bσ(y). To this end assume
that L ∈Fbσ(y). Then by the observation above we have Rec(σ)(L) ∈Fy. Since
Rec(σ)(L) satisﬁes x →y it follows that Rec(σ)(L) ∈Fx and thus, again by the
observation above, L ∈Fbσ(x). That is, L satisﬁes bσ(x) →bσ(y) as required.

Closure under the lattice operations, Boolean complement, residuation, and in-
verses of morphisms are the hypotheses of the original Eilenberg theorem.
As
mentioned earlier, various generalizations have allowed the relaxation of certain of
these hypotheses while keeping others. The treatment in [25], for which the duality
theoretic components have been given above, is the ﬁrst fully modular treatment

and the ﬁrst to allow the treatment of lattices of recognizable languages without
any further properties. We summarize the results and the location of their proofs
in the following table.

A full account of the method ensuing from these results will be treated elsewhere,
see also [41] and [42]. Some applications have already appeared in the literature,
see e.g. [13] and [35]. A further consequence of the relationship between Eilenberg-
Reiterman theory and extended Stone duality is that it allows the application of
duality also for classes of languages outside the recognizable fragment. This is the
subject of the paper [26] and of an on-going investigation into language classes given
by logic fragments with arbitrary natural number predicates by Gehrke, Krebs,
and Pin. This work has also inﬂuenced a number of other related works such as
[7, 11, 52, 4] and it would be interesting to explore the connections of our work
with [50].
