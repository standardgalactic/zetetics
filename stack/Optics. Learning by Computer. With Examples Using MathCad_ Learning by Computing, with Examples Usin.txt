Preface
This book was written over several years for a one-semester course in optics
for juniors and seniors in science and engineering; it uses Mathcad®1 scripts
to provide a simulated laboratory where students can learn by exploration and
discovery instead of passive absorption.
The text covers all the standard topics of a traditional optics course, includ-
ing geometrical optics and aberration, interference and diffraction, coherence,
Maxwell’s equations, wave guides and propagating modes, blackbody radiation,
atomic emission and lasers, optical properties of materials. Fourier transforms
and FT spectroscopy, image formation, and holography. It contains step-by-step
derivations of all basic formulas in geometrical, wave, and Fourier optics.
The basic text is supplemented by over 170 Mathcad ﬁles, each suggesting
programstosolveaparticularproblem,andeachlinkedtoatopicinorapplication
of optics. The computer ﬁles are dynamic, allowing the reader to see instantly the
effects of changing parameters in the equations. Students are thus encouraged to
ask “what if . . . ” questions to assess the physical implications of the formulas.
To integrate the ﬁles into the text, applications connecting the formulas and the
corresponding computer ﬁle are listed and may be assigned for homework. The
availability of the numerical Fourier transform makes possible a mathematical
introduction to the wave theory of imaging, spatial ﬁltering, holography, and
Fourier transform spectroscopy.
Thebookiswrittenforthestudyofparticularprojectsbutcaneasilybeadapted
to a variety of related studies. The threefold arrangements of text, applications,
and ﬁles make the book suitable of “self-learning” by scientists or engineers who
would like to refresh their knowledge of optics. Some ﬁles are printed out, and

PREFACE
all are available on a CD and may well serve as starting points to ﬁnd solutions
to more complex problems as experienced by engineers in their applications.
The book can be used in optical laboratories with faculty–student interaction.
The ﬁles may be changed and extended to study the assigned projects, and the
student may be required to hand in printouts of all assigned applications and
summarize in a sentence or two what has been learned. All ﬁles are available on
the CD as pdf-ﬁles. Information on variable range and parameters may be used
to print graphs with other computational programs.
I would like to thank Oren Sternberg and Jeffrey Ausiello for their help with
the manuscript, Professor Ken Chin for continuous support, Thomas von Foerster
of Springer-Verlag for his helpful advice and interest in this book, and my wife
for always keeping me in good spirit.

Geometrical

1.1
INTRODUCTION
Geometrical optics uses light rays to describe image formation by spherical
surfaces, lenses, mirrors, and optical instruments. Let us consider the real image
of a real object, produced by a positive thin lens. Cones of light are assumed to
divergefromeachobjectpointtothelens.Theretheconesoflightaretransformed
into converging beams traveling to the corresponding real image points. We
develop a very simple method for a geometrical construction of the image, using
just two rays among the object, the image, and the lens. We decompose the object
into object points and draw a line from each object point through the center of
the lens. A formula is developed to give the distance of the image point, when
the distance of the object point and the focal length of the lens are known. We
assume that the line from object to image point makes only small angles with the
axis of the system. This approximation is called the paraxial theory. Assuming
that the object and image points are in a medium with refractive index 1 and that
the lens has the focal length f, the simple mathematical formula
1
−x0
+ 1
xi
 1
f
(1.1)
gives the image position xi when the object position x0 and the focal length are
known.
Formulas of this type can be developed for spherical surfaces, thin and thick
lenses, and spherical mirrors, and one may call this approach the thin lens model.
For the description of the imaging process, we use the following laws.
1. Light propagates in straight lines.
2. The law of refraction,
n1 sin θ1  n2 sin θ2.
(1.2)

1. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS
The light travels through the medium of refractive index n1 and makes the an-
gle θ1 with the normal of the interface. After traversing the interface, the angle
changes to θ2, and the light travels in the medium with refractive index n2.
3. The law of reﬂection
θ1  θ2.
(1.3)
The law of reﬂection is the limiting case for the situation where both refraction
indices are the same and one has a reﬂecting surface. The laws of refraction
and reﬂection may be derived from Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic
waves, but may also be derived from a “mechanical model” using Fermat’s
Principle.
The refractive index in a dielectric medium is deﬁned as n  c/v, where v
is the speed of light in the medium and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. The
speed of light is no longer the ratio of the unit length of the length standard over
the unit time of the time standard, but is now deﬁned as 2.99792458 × 108m/s
for vacuum. For practical purposes one uses c  3 × 108m/s, and assumes that
in air the speed v of light is the same as c. In dielectric materials, the speed v is
smaller than c and therefore, the refractive index is larger than 1.
Image formation by our eye also uses just one lens, but not a thin one of ﬁxed
focal length. The eye lens has a variable focal length and is capable of forming
images of objects at various distances without changing the distance between the
eye lens and the retina. Optical instruments, such as magniﬁers, microscopes,
and telescopes, when used with our eye for image formation, can be adjusted
in such a way that we can use a ﬁxed focal length of our eye. Image formation
by our eye has an additional feature. Our brain inverts the image arriving on the
retina, making us think that an inverted image is erect.
1.2
FERMAT’S PRINCIPLE AND THE LAW OF
REFRACTION
In the seventeenth century philosophers contemplated the idea that nature always
acts in an optimum fashion. Let us consider a medium made of different sections,
with each having a different index of refraction. Light will move through each
section with a different velocity and along a straight line. But since the sections
have different refractive indices, the light does not move along a straight line
from the point of incidence to the point of exit.
The mathematician Fermat formulated the calculation of the optimum path as
an integral over the optical path

Theopticalpathisdeﬁnedastheproductofthegeometricalpathandtherefractive
index. In Figure 1.1 we show the length of the path from P1 to P2,
r1(y) + r2(y).
(1.5)
In comparison, the optical path is deﬁned as
n1r1(y) + n2r2(y),
(1.6)
where n1 is the refractive index in medium 1 and n2 is the refractive index in
medium 2.
The optimum value of the integral of Eq. (1.4) describes the shortest optical
path from P1 to P2 through a medium in which it moves with two different
velocities. It is important to compare only passes in the same neighborhood. In
Figure 1.2 we show an example of what should not be compared.
In Figure 1.1, the light ray moves with v1 in the ﬁrst medium and is incident
on the interface, making the angle θ1 with the normal. After penetrating into the

the reﬂection on the mirror should be considered.

medium in which its speed is v2, the angle with respect to the normal changes
from θ1 to θ2.
Let us look at a popular example. A swimmer cries for help and a lifeguard
starts running to help him. He runs on the sand with v1, faster than he can swim
in the water with v2. To get to the swimmer in minimum time, he will not choose
the straight line between his starting point and the swimmer in the water. He will
run a much larger portion on the sand and then get into the water. Although the
total length (in meter’s) of this path is larger than the straight line, the total time
is smaller. The problem is reduced to what the angles θ1 and θ2 are at the normal
of the interface (Figure 1.1). We show that these two angles are determined by
the law of refraction, assuming that the velocities are known.
In Figure 1.1 the light from point P1 travels to point P2 and passes the point Q
at the boundary of the two media with indices n1 and n2. The velocity for travel
from P1 to Q is v1  c/n1. The velocity for travel from Q to P2 is v2  c/n2.
From Eq. (1.4) and Figure 1.1, the optical path is
n1r1(y) + n2r2(y),
(1.7)
where we have
r1(y) 

{x2q + y2}
r2(y) 

{(xf −xq)2 + (yf −y)2}
(1.8)
and with r1(y)  v1t1(y) and r2(y)  v2t2(y) we get for the total time T (y), to
travel from P1 to P2,
T (y)  r1(y)/v1 + r2(y)/v2.
(1.9)
Only for the special case that v1  v2, where the refractive indices are equal,
will the light travel along a straight line. For different velocities, the total travel
time through medium 1 and 2 will be a minimum. In FileFig 1.1 we show a graph
of T (y) and see the minimum for a speciﬁc value of y. In FileFig 1.2 we discuss
the case where light is traveling through three media. To determine the optimum
conditions we have to require that
dT (y)/dy  0.
(1.10)
This may be done without a computer. We show it in FileFig 1.3 for two media.
Using the expression for r1(y) and r2(y) of Figure 1.1, we have to differentiate
n1r1(y) + n2r2(y),
(1.11)
that is,
dT (y)/dy  d/dy{(c/v1)

x2q + y2 + (c/v2)

(xf −xq)2 + (yf −y)2}
(1.12)
and set it to zero. From FileFig 1.3 we get
y/(r1(y)v1) + (y −yf )/(r2(y)v2)  0.

PRISMS
A prism is known for the dispersion of light, that is, the decomposition of white
light into its colors. The different colors of the incident light beam are deviated
by different angles for different colors. This is called dispersion, and the angles
depend on the refractive index of the prism material, which depends on the
wavelength. Historically Newton used two prisms to prove his “Theory of Color.”
The ﬁrst prism dispersed the light into its colors. The second prism, rotated by 90
degrees, was used to show that each color could not be decomposed any further.
Dispersion is discussed in Chapter 8. Here we treat only the angle of deviation
for a particular wavelength, depending on the value of the refractive index n.
1.3.1
Angle of Deviation
We now study the light path through a prism. In Figure 1.3 we show a cross-
section of a prism with apex angle A and refractive index n. The incident ray
makes an angle θ1 with the normal, and the angle of deviation with respect to
the incident light is call δ. We have from Figure 1.3 for the angles
δ  θ1 −θ2 + θ4 −θ3
A  θ2 + θ3
(1.17)
and using the laws of refraction
sin θ1  n sin θ2
n sin θ3  sin θ4
(1.18)
we get for the angle of deviation, using asin for sin−1
δ  θ1 + asin {(

n2 sin2(θ1)) sin(A) −sin(θ1) cos(A)} −A.
(1.19)
In FileFig 1.4 a graph is shown of δ (depending on the angle of incidence. A
formula may be derived to calculate the minimum deviation δm of the prism,
depending on n and A. From the Eq. (1.17) and (1.18) we have
δ  θ1 −θ2 + θ4 −θ3,
A  θ2 + θ3,

and
sin θ1  n sin θ2,
n sin θ3  sin θ4.
(1.21)
We can eliminate θ2 and θ4 and get two equations in θ1 and θ3,
sin θ1  n sin(A −θ3)
(1.22)
n sin θ3  sin(δ + A −θ1).
(1.23)
The differentiations with respect to the angle of Eqs. (1.22) and (1.23) may
be done using the “symbolic capabilities” of a computer (see FileFig 1.5). To
calculate the optimum condition, the results of the differentiations have to be
zero:
cos θ1dθ1 + n cos(A −θ3)dθ3  0
(1.24)
n cos θ3dθ3 + cos(δ + A −θ1)dθ1  0.
(1.25)
We consider these equations as two linear homogeneous equations of the un-
known dθ1 and dθ3. In order to have a nontrivial solution of the system of the
two linear equations, the determinant has to vanish. This is done in FileFig 1.5,
and one gets
cos θ1 cos θ3 −cos(A −θ3) cos(δ + A −θ1)  0.
The minimum deviation δm, which depends only on n and A, may be calculated
from
δm  2 asin {n sin(A/2)} −A,
(1.26)
where we use asin for sin−1. At the angle of minimum deviation, the light tra-
verses the prism in a symmetric way. Equation (1.26) may be used to ﬁnd the
dependence of prism material on the refractive index n.

CONVEX SPHERICAL SURFACES
Spherical surfaces may be used for image formation. All rays from an object
point are refracted at the spherical surface and travel to an image point. The
diverging light from the object point may converge or diverge after traversing
the spherical surface. If it converges, we call the image point real; if it diverges
we call the image point virtual.

We want to derive a formula to describe the imaging process on a convex spher-
ical refracting surface between two media with refractive indices n1 and n2
(Figure 1.4). The light travels from left to right and a cone of light diverges
from the object point P1 to the convex spherical surface. Each ray of the cone is
refracted at the spherical surface, and the diverging light from P1 is converted to
converging light, traveling to the image point P2. The object point P1 is assumed

10
1. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS
to be in a medium with index n1, the image point P2 in the medium with index
n2. We assume that n2 > n1, and that the convex spherical surface has the radius
of curvature r > 0.
For our derivation we assume that all angles are small; that is, we use the
approximation of the paraxial theory. To ﬁnd out what is small, one may look at
a table of y1  sin θ and compare it with y1  θ. The angle should be in radians
and then one may ﬁnd angles for which y1 and y2 are equal to a desired accuracy.
We consider a cone of light emerging from point P1. The outermost ray,
making an angle α1 with the axis of the system, is refracted at the spherical
surface, and makes an angle α2 with the axis at the image point P2 (Figure 1.4).
The refraction on the spherical surface takes place with the normal being an
extension of the radius of curvature r, which has its center at C. We call the
distance from P1 to the spherical surface the object distance xo, and the distance
from the spherical surface to the image point P2, the image distance xi. In short,
we may also use xo for “object point” and xi for “image point.”
The incident ray with angle α1 has the angle θ1 at the normal, and pene-
trating in medium 2, we have the angle of refraction θ2. Using the small angle
approximation, we have for the law of refraction
θ2  n1θ1/n2.
(1.27)
From Figure 1.4 we have the relations:
α1 + β  θ1
and
α2 + θ2  β.
(1.28)
For the ratio of the angles of refraction we obtain
θ1/θ2  n2/n1  (α1 + β)/(β −α2).
(1.29)
We rewrite the second part of the equation as
n1α1 + n2α2  (n2 −n1)β.
(1.30)
The distance l in Figure 1.4 may be represented in three different ways.
tan α1  l/xo,
tan α2  l/xi,
and
tan β  l/r.
(1.31)
Using small angle approximation, we substitute Eq. (1.31) into Eq. (1.30) and get
n1l/xo + n2l/xi  (n2 −n1)l/r.

The ls cancel out and we have obtained the image-forming equation for a spher-
ical surface between media with refractive index n1 and n2, for all rays in a cone
of light from P1 to P2:
n1/x0 + n2/xi  (n2 −n1)/r.
(1.33)
So far all quantities have been considered to be positive.
1.4.2
Sign Convention
Inthefollowingwedistinguishbetweenaconvexandaconcavesphericalsurface.
The incident light is assumed to travel from left to right, and the object is to the left
of the spherical surface. We place the spherical surface at the origin of a Cartesian
coordinate system. For a convex spherical surface the radius of curvature r is
positive; for a concave spherical surface r is negative. Similarly we have positive
values for object distance x0 and image distance xi, when placed to the right of
the spherical surface, and negative values when placed to the left.
Using this sign convention, we write Eq. (1.33) with a minus sign, and have
the equation of “spherical surface imaging” (observe the minus sign),

The pair of object and image points are called conjugate points.
We may deﬁne ζo  xo/n1, ζi  xi/n2, and ρ  r/(n2 −n1) and have from
Eq. (1.34)
−1/ζo + 1/ζi  1/ρ.
(1.35)
This simpliﬁcation will be useful for other derivations of imaging equations.
1.4.3
Object and Image Distance, Object and Image Focus,
Real and Virtual Objects, and Singularities
When the object point is placed to the left of the spherical surface, we call it a
real object point. When it appears to the right of the spherical surface, we call it
a virtual object point. A virtual object point is usually the image point produced
by another system and serves as the object for the following imaging process.
To get an idea, of how the positions of the image point depend on the positions
of the object point, we use the equation of spherical surface imaging
−n1/xo + n2/xi  (n2 −n1)/r
(1.36)
or
xi  n2/[(n2 −n1)/r + n1/xo],

and plot a graph (FileFig 1.6). We choose an object point in air with n1  1,
a spherical convex surface of radius of curvature r1  10, and refractive index
n2  1.5.
We do not add length units to the numbers. It is assumed that one uses the
same length units for all numbers associated with quantities of the equations.
When the object point is assumed to be at negative inﬁnity, we have the image
point at the image focus
xif  n2r/(n2 −n1).
(1.37)
Similarly there is the object focus, when the image point is assumed to be at
positive inﬁnity
xof  −n1r/(n2 −n1).
(1.38)
We see from the graph of FileFig 1.6 that there is a singularity at the object focus
(at xo  −20). To the left of the object focus all values of xi are positive. To the
right of the object focus the values of xi are ﬁrst negative, from the object focus
to zero, and then positive to the right to inﬁnity.
When xo  0 we have in Eq. (1.36) another singularity, and as a result we have
xi  0. One may get around problems in plotting graphs around singularities t
by using numerical values for xo that never have values of the singular points.
In FileFig 1.7 we have calculated the image point for four speciﬁcally chosen
object points, discussed below.

Real Objects, Geometrical Constructions, and
Magniﬁcation
1.4.4.1
Geometrical Construction for Real Objects to the Left of the Object Focus
We consider an extended object consisting of many points. A conjugate point at
the image corresponds to each point. When using a spherical surface for image
formation, a cone of light emerges from each object point and converges to the
conjugate image point. Let us present the object by an arrow, parallel to the
positive y axis. The corresponding image will also appear at the image parallel
to the y axis, but in the opposite direction (Figure 1.5).
The image position and size can then be determined by a simple geometrical
construction. In Figure 1.5a we look at the ray connecting the top of the object
arrow with the center of curvature of the spherical surface. We call the light ray
corresponding to this line the C-ray (from center). A second ray, the PF-ray,
starts at the top of the object arrow and is parallel to the axis along the distance
to the spherical surface. It is refracted and travels to the image focal point Fi on
the right side of the spherical surface (Figure 1.5c). The paraxial approximation

requires that all C-rays and PF-rays have small angles with the axis of the system.
The C-ray and the PF-ray meet at the top of the image arrow.
1.4.4.2
Geometrical Construction for Real Object to the Right of the Object Focus
We place the object arrow between the object focus and the spherical surface.
From FileFig 1.7, with the input data we have used before, we ﬁnd that the
image position is at −30, when the object position is at −10. The geometrical
construction is shown in Figure 1.7b. The C-ray and the PF-ray diverge in the
forward direction to the right. However, if we trace both rays back they converge
on the left side of the spherical surface. We ﬁnd the top of an image arrow at
the image position, at −30. We call the image, obtained by tracing the diverging
rays back to a converging point, a virtual image. A virtual image may serve as a
real object for a second imaging process.
We have listed in Table 1.1 the image positions for real object positions
discussed so far and have indicated for images and objects if they are real or
virtual.

17
FIGURE 1.6
(a) The C-ray and the PF-ray diverge in the forward direction; (b) they are traced

1.4.4.3
Magniﬁcation
If we draw a C-ray from the top of the arrow representing the object, we ﬁnd the
top of the arrow presenting the image (Figure 1.6). The lateral magniﬁcation m
is deﬁned as
m  yi/yo.
(1.39)
It is obtained by using the proportionality of corresponding sides of right
triangles, and taking care of the sign convention
−yi/(xi −r)  yo/(−xo + r).
(1.40)
For m  yi/yo we have
m  −(xi −r)/(−xo + r).
(1.41)
Rewritten, eliminating the radius of curvature, one gets with Eq. (1.36),
m  yi/yo  (xi/xo)(n1/n2).
(1.42)
1.4.5
Virtual Objects, Geometrical Constructions, and

are shown in FileFig 1.7.
In FileFig 1.7, we have calculated the four object positions listed in Table 1.1
and shown in Figure 1.7a to d.
1. Real object left of object focus
A real object is positioned to the left of the object focus. The construction
uses the C-ray, PF-ray, and image focus. The rays converge to an image point,
we have a real image.
2. Real object between object focus and spherical surface
We draw the C-ray and the PF-ray and use the image focus. The rays diverge
in a forward direction. We trace both back to a point where they meet. The
image is a virtual image.
3. and 4. Virtual objects.
In Figures 1.7c and 1.7d we consider a virtual object to the right of the
spherical surface, one to the left and another to the right of the image focus.

of the virtual objects.
In Section 1.4 we discussed the case of Eq. (1.36) where n1 < n2 and r is
positive. The case where n1 > n2 and r is negative will result in a very similar
discussion and is considered as an application.
1.5
CONCAVE SPHERICAL SURFACES
The image-forming equation of a convex spherical surface (Eq. (1.34)), is
changed for application to a concave spherical surface by changing the radius
of curvature to a negative value. We show that this minor change makes image
formation quite different.
Again we assume that the refractive index to the left of the surface is smaller
than the refractive index on the right (n1 < n2). The formation of images of
extended objects, their magniﬁcation, and geometrical construction are similar
to the process discussed above for the convex spherical surface.
In FileFig 1.8 we have the graph for the dependence of xi on xo. In FileFig
1.9, we determine for four speciﬁc positions of xo, for real and virtual objects,
calculations of image positions and magniﬁcations. Observe the difference in
the position of object and image focus.

3. Virtual object between spherical surface and object focus.
We draw the C-ray and have to trace back the PF-ray to the surface and through
the image focus. From there, we extend the ray in a forward direction. The
rays converge in a forward direction and we have a real image.
4. Virtual objects to the right of object focus.
The C-ray is drawn through C in a forward direction. The PF-ray is traced
back to the surface and then drawn backwards through the image focus. In
the backward direction the two rays meet at a virtual image.
Comparing Figures 1.7 and 1.8, one ﬁnds that the regions of appearance of
real and virtual images are dependent upon the singularities: one when the object
distance is equal to the focal length, and the other when the object distance is
zero. A virtual image is always found when the C-ray and PF-ray diverge in a

forward direction. If we could place a screen into the position of a virtual image,
we could not detect it because the rays toward it are diverging.
The case where n1 > n2 and r is positive is very similar and is discussed as
an application in FileFig 1.9.

2. Rod sticks in water, calculation of image distance. A plastic rod of length 70
cm is stuck vertically in water. An object is positioned on the cross-section
at the top of the rod, which sticks out of the water and faces the sun. On the
other side in the water, the rod has a concave spherical surface, with respect
to the incident light from the sun, with r  −4 cm. The refractive index of
the rod is n1  1.5 and of water n2  1.33. Calculate the image distance of
the object.

before and after the object focal point.
4. Plastic ﬁlm on water as spherical surface. A plastic ﬁlm is mounted on a ring
and placed on the surface of water. The ﬁlm forms a spherical surface ﬁlled
with water. The thickness of the ﬁlm is neglected and therefore we have a
concave surface of water of n2  1.33. Sunlight is incident on the surface
and the image is observed 100 cm deep in the water. Calculate the radius of
curvature of the “spherical water surface.”

THIN LENS EQUATION
1.6.1
Thin Lens Equation
A thin lens has two spherical surfaces with a short distance between them. The
thin lens equation is a combination of the imaging equations applied to each of
the two surfaces. In the derivation of the ﬁnal equation, one ignores the distance
between the spherical surfaces. The result is an imaging equation, which has
the same absolute value for object and image focus. A positive lens has the
object focus to the left and the image focus to the right. For the derivation, we
assume that the lens has the refractive index n2, real objects are in a medium with
refractive index n1, and virtual objects are in a medium with refractive index n3.
To obtain the imaging equation of the thin lens we consider a convex and a
concave spherical surface, separated by the distance a. The imaging equation for
the ﬁrst single spherical surface, as given in Eq. (1.35), is
−1/ζo + 1/ζi  1/ρ1,
(1.43)
where ζo  xo/n1, ζi  xi/n2, ρ1  r1/(n2−n1), and all distances are measured
from the center of the ﬁrst surface. The imaging equation for the second spherical
surface is described by
−1/ζ ′
o + 1/ζ ′
i  1/ρ2,
(1.44)
where ζ ′
o  x′
o/n2, ζ ′
i  x′
i/n3, ρ2  r2/(n3−n2), and all distances are measured
from the center of the second surface.
The two surfaces are positioned such that their distance in medium n2 is “a”
(Figure 1.9). To relate this distance to the image distance of the ﬁrst surface
and the object distance of the second surface, we place both at the same point
(Figure 1.9). Measured from the ﬁrst spherical surface the image is at +ζi.
Measured from the second spherical surface the object is at −ζ ′
o. Since ζ ′
o and ζi
are distances divided by the refractive index, we have to do the same with “a”.

1. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS
To get the absolute value for a/n2 we have
−ζ ′
o + ζi  a/n2.
(1.45)
The relation holds for the coordinates of each lens, and substitution into the
equation for Surface 2 results in
−1/(−a/n2 + ζi) + 1/ζ ′
i  1/ρ2.
(1.46)
Adding Eq. (1.46) and the equation for Surface 1, that is, Eq. (1.43), we get
−1/ζo + 1/ζi −1/(−a/n2 + ζi) + 1/ζ ′
i  1/ρ2 + 1/ρ1.
(1.47)
The thickness a is now set to zero, two terms cancel each other out, and we obtain
−1/ζo + 1/ζ ′
i  1/ρ1 + 1/ρ2.
(1.48)
Rewriting Eq. (1.48) by using ζo  xo/n1, ζ ′
i  x′
i/n3, ρ1  r1/(n2 −n1), and
ρ2  r2/(n3 −n2), and setting x′
i  xi, we have
−n1/x0 + n3/xi  (n2 −n1)/r1 + (n3 −n2)/r2.
(1.49)
The focal length of the thin lens f is deﬁned as
1/f  (n2 −n1)/r1 + (n3 −n2)/r2
(1.50)
and depends on the refractive indices outside and inside the lens, and on the two
radii of curvature. In most cases both sides of the lens have the same refractive
index 1; that is, n3  n1  1. Calling the refractive index of the lens n, we have
1/f  (n −1)/r + (1 −n)/r′.
For a symmetric lens in air we obtain
1/f  2(n −1)/r.
Using n3  n1  1 and the focal length of Eqs. (1.50), we have from Eq. (1.49)
the thin lens equation,
−1/xo + 1/xi  1/f.
(1.51)
There are positive and negative values for f , associated with positive and
negative lenses. For example, a biconvex lens is a positive lens.
1.6.2
Object Focus and Image Focus
When f is positive, that is, for a positive lens, the object focus is on the left and
has the coordinate xof  −f , and the image focus is at xif  f . When f is
negative, that is, for a negative lens, the object focus is on the right and has the
coordinate xof  |f |, and the image focus is xif  −|f |.

Magniﬁcation
In Figure 1.10 we consider the case of a real object and real image and draw a
line from the top of the object arrow through the center of the lens to the top
of the arrow on the image arrow. The corresponding light ray is called the chief
ray and is again referred to as the C-ray. It passes the lens at the center and
therefore is not deviated by refraction. From the two “similar” triangles shown
in Figure 1.10 we deﬁne the magniﬁcation m as
m  yi/yo  xi/xo.

Positive Lens, Graph, Calculations of Image Positions,
and Graphical Constructions of Images
In FileFig 1.10 we show a graph of the thin lens equation. The image distance
xi is plotted as a function of xo for positive f . There is a singularity at the object
focus at −f . To the left of the object focus, xi is positive. To the right between
the object focus and lens, xi is negative, and on the right of the lens it is positive.
As a result, we have three sections. In the ﬁrst and third sections, for a positive
sign, the image is real. In the middle section, for a negative sign, the image is
virtual.
In FileFig 1.11 we have chosen four speciﬁc values of object distances and
calculate the corresponding image distances and magniﬁcations.

1. Realreal objectobject and real image.
The object is presented by an arrow of length yo, placed at the object point

be geometrically determined. The C-ray is drawn from the top of the object
arrow through the center of the thin lens. The second ray, the PF-ray, is drawn
from the object arrow parallel to the axis to the lens, and from there, through
the image focus. The two rays meet at the position of the image arrow. In
Figure 1.11a, we obtain for a real object a real image.
2. Real object and virtual image.
In Figure 1.11b we place the real object between the object focus and the lens
and draw the C-ray and PF-ray. These rays diverge in a forward direction

and both are traced back to the left. They meet at the virtual image. A virtual
image is always found when the C-ray and the PF-ray diverge in a forward
direction. If we could place a screen into the position of a virtual image, we
could not see it, because the rays toward the virtual image are diverging.
3. and 4. Virtual object and real images.
In Figures 1.11c and 1.11d we place the object to the right of the lens. We are
considering virtual objects. A virtual object may be produced by the image
formed by another optical imaging system. The virtual objects are placed
between the lens and the image focus and to the right of the image focus. In
both cases we draw the C-ray in a forward direction. The PF-1 ray is drawn
ﬁrst backward to the lens and then forward through the image focus. The
C-ray and the PF-ray converge to real images for all positions of the virtual
object.
The results of the calculations of the positive thin lens with f  −10 are
listed in Table 1.3.

Negative Lens, Graph, Calculations of Image
Positions, and Graphical Constructions of Images
In FileFig 1.12, we show graphs of the thin lens equation, plotting xi as a function
of xo for negative f . We see the singularity is at the object focus f , which is
now to the right of the lens. To the left of the lens, xi is negative. Between the
lens and the object focus, xi is positive. To the right of the object focus, xi is
negative. As a result, we have three sections. In the ﬁrst and third sections, for a
negative sign, the image is virtual. In the middle section, for a positive sign, the
image is real.
In FileFig 1.13, we have calculated for four speciﬁc values of object distance
the corresponding image distances and the magniﬁcation. In Figure 1.12 we have
the geometrical construction of the images for the values calculated in FileFig

The object is presented by an arrow of length yo, placed at the object point xo
to the left of the negative lens. The image point and the length of the arrow
presenting the image can be geometrically determined using the C-ray and
the PF-ray. The C-ray is drawn from the top of the object arrow through the
center of the thin lens. The PF-ray is drawn from the object arrow parallel to
the axis to the lens, and then diverges in a forward direction. It is traced back
to the image focus. The two rays meet at the positions of the image arrow. In
Figures 1.12a and 1.12b, we obtain for a real object a virtual image. A virtual
image is obtained when the C-ray and the PF-ray diverge in a “forward”
direction.
3. Virtual object between lens and object focus.
In Figure 1.12c, we place the virtual object between the object focus and
the lens and draw the C-ray. The PF-ray is ﬁrst traced back to the lens, then
connected to the image focus, and extended in the forward direction. The two
rays meet in the forward direction at a real image.
4. Virtual object on the right side of the object focus.
In Figure 1.12d, we place the virtual object to the right of the object focus
and draw the C-ray. The PF-ray is ﬁrst traced back to the lens, then connected
to the image focus and extended further in the backward direction. The two
rays meet in the backward direction for a virtual image.
The results of the calculations of the negative thin lens with f  −10 are
listed in Table 1.4
For the geometrical construction, we note that the size of the lens does not
matter. One uses a plane in the middle of the lens with sufﬁcient extension in the
y direction; see Figure 1.13a.

Thin Lens and Two Different Media on the Outside
We go back to the thin lens equation and choose different indices of refraction
at the two media on both sides of the lens. We start again from the deﬁnitions
ζo  xo/n1, ζ ′
i  xi/n3, ρ1  r1/(n2 −n1) and ρ2  r2/(n3 −n2) and have
−n1/x0 + n3/xi  (n2 −n1)/r1 + (n3 −n2)/r2.
(1.53)
We call the focal length of the thin lens fn given by
1/fn  (n2 −n1)/r1 + (n3 −n2)/r2
(1.54)
and obtain the thin lens equation
−n1/xo + n3/xi  1/fn.
(1.55)

34
1. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS
This equation is very similar to the spherical surface imaging equation discussed
in Section 1.4a just as we found there, we have different values for the object
focus and image focus.
For the object focus, when the image point is assumed to be at positive inﬁnity,
we have
xof  −n1fn
(1.56)
and for the image focus, obtained when the object point is assumed to be at
negative inﬁnity, we have
xif  n3fn.
(1.57)
The construction of the images for positive and negative lenses is similar to the
procedure for the spherical surfaces and is not discussed further. The value of
the focal length for different cases of the refractive indices may be calculated
using FileFig 1.14.

OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS
Optical instruments, such as magniﬁers, and microscopes, enlarge tiny objects,
making it possible to observe objects we can barely see with the naked eye. The
magniﬁer gives us a modest magniﬁcation, in most cases less than ten times. The
microscope makes it possible to observe objects of about 1 micron diameter, and
the telescope enables us to see objects at a far distance in more detail. Our eye is
a one lens system and may produce a real image of a real object, like a positive
lens (Figure 1.11a). The real image of a real erect object of a positive lens is

36
1. GEOMETRICAL OPTICS
inverted. However, our brain makes a “correction” (another inversion) and we
“see” the object erect, as it is. In discussing optical instruments, we have to take
this fact into account when making statements about image formation. For a
microscope or astronomical telescope it does not matter much if the ﬁnal image
is erect or inverted. However, for the telescope of a sharpshooter it is important.
From Figures 1.11 and 1.12, we read a simple rule: If the image appears at
the same side of the lens as an erect object, it is erect. If it appears on the other
side of the lens, it is inverted.
1.7.1
Two Lens System
To obtain the ﬁnal image distance of a two-lens system, one ﬁrst applies the
thin lens equation to the ﬁrst lens and determines the image distance. The object
distance for the second lens is calculated from the distance between the two
lenses and the image distance of the ﬁrst lens. The thin lens equation is then
applied to the second lens and the ﬁnal image distance for a two-lens system is
obtained as the distance from the second lens. The formulas for this procedure
are listed in FileFig 1.15.
For graphical constructions one proceeds in the same way. Using C- and PF-
rays, one constructs the image of the ﬁrst lens. The image is taken as an object
for the second lens, and C- and PF-rays are used to construct the image formed
by the second lens. The existence of the ﬁrst lens is ignored when going through
the second process.
The magniﬁcation of the system is the product m of the magniﬁcation of each
of the two lenses. One has m  m1m2 with m1  xi1/xo1 and m2  xi2/xo2,
where m1 is calculated with respect to the ﬁrst lens and m2 with respect to the
second lens.

Magniﬁer and Object Positions
The size of an image on the retina increases when placed closer and closer to the
eye. There is a shortest distance at which the object may be placed, called the near

Two positive lenses in the magniﬁer conﬁguration: (a) the virtual image yi of the
object y0 serves as object Yoe for the eye lens. The image yie (see bold dotted lines) appears on the

(c) the object of the eye in the inﬁnity conﬁguration.
point at about 25 cm. For shorter distances the eye can no longer accommodate
production of an image because the eye–retina distance is ﬁxed. To increase the
size of the object one may use a positive lens as a magniﬁer. In Figure 1.14, we
show the magniﬁer and the eye as a two-thin-lens system. In FileFig 1.16 we
show the calculation of the image distance for a two lens system. We assume that
the positive lens and the eye are separated by a distance of D  1 cm. Object
distance and focal lengths of the lenses are both input data.
From Figure 1.14, we see that the ﬁrst lens produces a virtual erect image of
a real erect object. The second lens (eye) treats the virtual erect image as a real
erect object and produces a real inverted image on the retina. The ﬁnal image on
the retina is inverted. However, we “see” it upright because our brain does the
conversion. The virtual image of the magniﬁer lens is the object of the eye lens.
The object producing this virtual image may only be positioned with respect to
the magniﬁer in such a way that the virtual image is not closer than the near
point, but may have a distance as large as negative inﬁnity. We therefore discuss
the two cases: the virtual image is at the near point; and the virtual image is at
inﬁnity.

1.7.2.1
Virtual Image at Near Point
The virtual image produced by the ﬁrst lens is the real erect object for the second
lens (eye), and is assumed to be at the near point (−25 cm). In the ﬁrst step, we
calculate the object distance for the ﬁrst lens when the image is at −25 cm from
the second lens (eye). In the second step we consider the eye. The calculation is
shown in FileFig 1.17 where the magniﬁcation of the magniﬁer is given as
m1  xi1/xo1
(1.58)
and of the eye as
m2  xi2/xo2.
(1.59)
Considering only the magniﬁcation m1 of the magniﬁer, one may use the thin lens
equation in order to express m1 in known quantities; that is, f1 and xi1  −25.
We have
m1  xi1/xo1  xi1(1/xo1)  xi1(−1)(1/f −1/xi1)  (1 −xi1/f1).
(1.60)
Neglecting the distance D between magniﬁer and eye lens, and setting xi1 
−25, we obtain for the magniﬁcation,
m1  1 + 25/f1.
(1.61)
1.7.2.2
Virtual Image at Inﬁnity
The virtual image produced by the ﬁrst lens is assumed to be at negative inﬁnity
(−∞). It is the real erect object for the second lens (eye). The calculation is
shown in FileFig 1.18 for f1  12, and taking for xi1 the numerical value of
−1010. For the magniﬁcation of the magniﬁer we get, after using the thin-lens
equation, similarly done as in Eq. (1.60),
m1  xi1/xo1  1 −xi1/f 1  8.333108,
This is a meaningless number. In order to discuss the case where the virtual image
is at inﬁnity, we have to change our approach and consider angular magniﬁcation.

1.7.2.3
Angular Magniﬁcation or Magnifying Power
To avoid the difﬁculties we encountered in Section 1.7.2.2, where we calculated
meaningless numbers for the magniﬁcation, we take a different approach and
use angular magniﬁcation. We compare the angles at the eye by looking at the
object with and without a magniﬁer (Figure 1.15).
The object is positioned at the near point because that gives the largest mag-
niﬁcation without a lens. First the eye looks at the object without a magniﬁer,
(Figure 1.15a), where angle α is
α  yo1/xo1  yo1/(−25).
(1.62)
Then we introduce the magniﬁer and have for the angle β, as shown in
Figure 1.15b,
β  yi1/xi1  yo1/xo1  yo1(1/xi1 −1/f1),
(1.63)
where xo1β is the object distance when calculating the angle β, and the thin-lens
equation was used to eliminate xo1β.
We deﬁne the angular magniﬁcation or magnifying power as
MP  β/α  −25(1/xi1 −1/f1).
(1.64)
We now discuss the applications of angular magniﬁcation to the cases where the
virtual image is at the near point and at inﬁnity.

We consider the virtual image of lens 1 as the real object of lens 2. We have

This value is marked on magniﬁers as MP times x. Example: for f1  5 we
would have MP  5x.
In both cases the object is placed at the near point of the eye without a
magniﬁer, and the resulting angular magniﬁcation depends on the focal length
of the magniﬁer.

Microscope as Three-Lens System
In a compound microscope, the ﬁrst lens L1 (objective lens) has a short focal
length and forms a real inverted image of a real erect object. Then the magniﬁer
conﬁguration is applied, which is the second lens L2 (ocular lens) plus the eye
lens. See Section 1.7.2 above and Figure 1.16. The ﬁnal image on the retina is
erect, but we see it upside down.
We ignore the eye lens and calculate the ﬁnal image of a two lens system,
using for the image distance xi1 the ﬁxed value of tube length 16 cm plus Fi1 (in
cm), see Figure 1.16. The magniﬁcation is the product of m1 of the objective lens,
times m2 of the ocular lens (magniﬁer). We discuss the following cases where
the magniﬁer is used in (1) the near point conﬁguration, and (2) the virtual image
at inﬁnity conﬁguration.

1. Magniﬁcation, Near Point Conﬁguration, Magnifying Power
In FileFig 1.19 we calculate the magniﬁcation, using f1  2, xi1  16 + f1,
f2  6, and xi2  −25; we have for the magniﬁcation
m  m1m2  (xi1/xo1)(xi2/xo2)  −41.34.
(1.67)
The magnifying power MP for the magniﬁer in the Near point conﬁguration
was obtained in Eq. (1.66), and was the same as the magniﬁcation m1m2. Using
the thin-lens equation to xo1 and x02 we have
MP  m1m2  xi1(−1)(1/f1 −1/xi1)xi2(−1)(1/f2 −1/xi2)
 (1 −[16 + f1]/f1)(1 + 25/f2)
(1.68)
and as the result we get m1m2  −41.34. Neglecting f1 with respect to 16 we
have
MP ≈(1 −16/f1)(1 + 25/f2)  −36.17.
(1.69)
The negative magniﬁcation indicates that we see the object upside down.

2. Magniﬁcation, Virtual Image at Inﬁnity, Magnifying Power
We assume that the virtual image is at inﬁnity; that is, x2i  −∞. The calcula-
tions using the direct approach, which is m  (xi1/xo1)(xi2/xo2), are shown in
FileFig 1.20. Using f12 cm, xi1  16 + f1, f2  6 cm, and xi2  −1010 cm,
we obtain a meaningless number.
The magnifying power in the near point conﬁguration of the magniﬁer was
obtained in Eq. (1.68) as MP  (1 −[16 + f1]/f1)(1 + 25/f2). The second
factor changes for the case where the “virtual image is at inﬁnity,” and the result
is
MP  (1 −[16 + f1]/f1)(25/f2)  −33.333.
(1.70)
Neglecting f1 with respect to 16 one has
MP  −(16/f1)(25/f2)  −29.167.

Magniﬁcation of Commercial Microscopes
Commercial microscopes give the magniﬁcation of the objective and eye lens by
a MPx value, similar to the one discussed above for the magniﬁer. For example,
the magniﬁer power MP of the microscope was approximately −(16/f1)(25/f2).
Assuming f1  2 and f2  6, the objective would be marked 8x and the ocular
4x. The magniﬁcation of this microscope would be 32 times.

Telescope
1.7.4.1
Kepler Telescope
In a simple telescope, the ﬁrst lens L1 forms an image of a far away object at a
distance close to the focal point f1 of the objective lens (Figure 1.17). The object
is considered real and erect, and the image is real inverted. The second lens is
the magniﬁer lens and the eye and magniﬁer lens are used together in the virtual
image at −∞conﬁguration. In this setup the image of lens 1, which is the object
of lens 2, is close to the focal point of f2, and forms an inverted virtual image
at inﬁnity. When we look at this virtual image the ﬁnal image on the retina is
erect, but we see it upside down. The calculations are shown in FileFig 1.21. To
ﬁnd the approximate magniﬁcation of the telescope, we do not need to use the
concept of magnifying power and can use the calculation of the magniﬁcation:
m  (xi1/xo1)(xi2/xo2),
(1.72)
where m1  xi1/xo1 is about f1/xo1, because the image of lens 1 is close to
the focal point. For m2  xi2/xo2 we have approximately −xi2/f2, because
the object for f2 is close to the focal point. Since xo1 and xi2 are both large
numbers of the same order of magnitude, they cancel each other out and for the

magniﬁcation we have
m  m1m2  −f1/f2.
(1.73)
Note that this is a negative number since f1 and f2 are both positive, and the
object is “seen” inverted.
To get a large magniﬁcation, we need a large value of f1 and a small one of
f2. The large value of the focal length of the ﬁrst lens makes powerful telescopes
“large.”

1.7.4.2
Galilean Telescope
The Galilean telescope is the combination of a positive lens L1 and a negative
lens L2. The positive lens forms a real inverted image of a far-away real erect
object (Figure 1.18a). The negative lens replaces the magniﬁer. The image of
lens 1 is the object for lens 2 and is virtual inverted. Lens 2 forms a virtual erect
image of it, at negative inﬁnity (Figure 1.18b). The eye looks at the virtual erect
image of lens 2 as a real erect object and forms a real inverted image on the retina
(we see it erect). The calculation is shown in FileFig 1.22. For the magniﬁcation

lens L1 and the image is yi1, located close to xi1  f1; (b) the image of lens 1 is virtual inverted

of the eye lens and the image yie appears on the retina upside down, therefore we see it erect.

one gets:
m  (xi1/xo1)(xi2/xo2),
(1.74)
where m1  xi1/xo1 is approximately f1/xo1 because the image of lens 1 is
close to the focal point. The magniﬁcation of the second lens, m2  xi2/xo2, is
approximately −xi2/f2, because the object of lens 2 is close to the focal point
and to the right side of the lens, and f2 is negative. Since xo1 and xi2 are both
large numbers, of the same order of magnitude, they cancel each other out and
we have for the magniﬁcation
m  m1m2  −f1/f2.
(1.75)
Note that this is a positive number since f2 is a negative lens, and the object
is seen erect. The Galilean telescope is used for many terrestrial applications in
theaters and on ships.

The Galilean telescope is treated as a two-lens system with the ﬁrst lens having
a positive focal length and the second lens a negative focal length. For xo1 and
xi2 the same large negative numerical values are assumed. The magniﬁcation
is calculated as m  (xi1/xo1)(xi2/xo2) and results in m  m1m2  −f1/f2.
(Note that the numerical value is positive.) Lens L1: f1  30, xo1  −1010,

MATRIX FORMULATION FOR THICK LENSES

Refraction and Translation Matrices
A thick lens has two spherical surfaces separated by a dielectric material of a
certain thickness. Previously we ignored the distance between the two surfaces

refractive indices.
but now take it into account. One may calculate the image formation of the thick
lens by ﬁrst ﬁnding the image produced by the ﬁrst surface. Then one uses this
image as an object in the second imaging process and ﬁnds the image produced
by the second surface. One could also use this procedure for lens systems with
many lenses (Figure 1.19). However, one can develop a mathematical formalism
to describe the image formation of a system of lenses by using the thin-lens
equation. But one now has to measure the object and image distance from newly
determined “principal planes,” and not from the center of the thick lens. To do
this, we ﬁrst consider the case of refraction on a spherical surface (Figure 1.20).
We want to represent the ﬁrst surface by an operation which transforms the set of
coordinates of the object into the set of coordinates of the ﬁrst image. We show
that this operation can be represented by a transformation matrix, which we
call refraction matrix. Then we make a translation to get to the second surface,
accomplished by a translation matrix, and the next operation on the second
surface is again associated with a refraction matrix. This method is applicable to
many different curved surfaces and their separations, having different thickness
and refraction indices. The mathematical operation representing the processes
of refraction at one and translation between two surfaces is a two-by-two matrix.
The matrices are derived by using the paraxial theory, taking as the coordinates
the distance from the axis of the point of the ray at the surface and the angle the
ray makes with the axes (Figure 1.20a).
We now construct matrices to represent the refraction and translation opera-
tions. The matrices act on sets of two coordinates, written in the form of a vector.
The initial coordinates (index1) in the plane of the object are acted on, and the
result is the set of coordinates (index 2) in the plane of the image. We start from
the equation for refraction on a single surface
−n1/xo + n2/xi  (n2 −n1)/r
(1.76)
and rewrite it, using α1 and l1 (see Figure 1.20a), as
n1(α1/l1) + n2(−α2/l2)  (n2 −n1)/r.
(1.77)
In addition we have for the second coordinate
l1  l2.

The Matrix
For a thick lens we use the refraction and translation matrices. We apply the
refraction matrix corresponding to the ﬁrst spherical surface, the translation
matrix corresponding to the thickness of the lens, and the refraction matrix
corresponding to the second spherical surface. We again assume that the light
comes from the left, and realize that the sequence of the matrices is the sequence
of action on I1. In other words, the ﬁrst surface is represented by the matrix on
the far right.

Application to the Thin Lens
We demonstrate more about the meaning and signiﬁcance of the four matrix
elements when reducing the matrix to the one corresponding to a thin lens. We
use two surfaces close together; that is, we set d  0 (Figure 1.21). The product

expressions into Eq. (1.89) and write the matrix with the coordinate vectors as

that Eq. (1.90) is equivalent to the thin-lens equation. Multiplication yields
l2  l1

We see that if the 0,0 and 1,1 elements are 1 and the 0,1 element is zero, we may
obtain the focal length of the thin lens from the 1,0 element; that is, −1/f 
P23 + (n2/n1)P12.
We have gone through this example of the thin lens to show how the procedure
with the refraction matrix works to get to the object–image relation. We measure
xo and xi from the surfaces of the thin lens, and apply in the usual way the
thin-lens equation, and take the focal length from the 1,0 element.
1.8.2.3
Thick Lens
For a thick lens, the matrix elements 0,0 and 1,1 of Eq. (1.88) are not 1, and the
0,1 element is not zero. To apply a similar procedure to that discussed for the
thin lens, we introduce a transformation in order to get the 0,0 and 1,1 element
to 1 and the 0,1 element to 0. These three requirements may be obtained by
application of a translation. We ﬁrst translate by −h the plane of the object and
at the end we go back by a translation of hh. The introduction of these two new
parameters corresponds to the displacements of the points from which we have
to count xo and xi. We apply these two translations to the thick-lens matrix of
Eq. (1.88) and have to calculate

(1.95)
There are three requirements to be fulﬁlled, and only two new parameters. We
set M0,0 + hhM1,0  1 and −M1,0h + M1,1  1, and calculate h and hh. In
order to be successful, the introduction of the calculated values of h and hh from
these two equations must make the 0,1 element zero. It can be shown analytically
that [−M0,0h + M0,1 + hh(−M1,0h + M1,1)]  0, and numerically as seen in
FileFig 1.24.
We have the same form of the matrix as in Eq. (1.89) and ﬁnd that the (2,1)
element has not been changed by the transformation. We have P  −1/f 
M1,0. As a result of our transformation we have for the parameters h, hh, and
the focal length

has the effect that we have to count xo from the point on the axis determined
by h, and xi from the point on the axis determined by hh. We do not count from
the vertex of the spherical surfaces. If we call the vertex of the ﬁrst surface V1
and the vertex of the second surface V2, we have a similar sign convention as we
have used before:
1. if h > 0, the point to start calculating xo is to the right of V1; otherwise to the
left; and
2. if hh > 0, the point to start calculating xi is to the right of V2; otherwise to
the left.

n1  n3  1, r1  20, and r2  ∞.
If we set n2  n  1.5, n1  n3  1, r1  r  d, and r2  ∞, we have
the result that P12  −1/3r, P23  0, P  −1/2r; that is, f  2r, h  0,
and hh  −2r/3. We ﬁnd for the numerical calculation that the (0,0) and (1,1)
elements are equal to zero and the (0,1) element is equal to 1.

From Figure 1.23 we see that the principal planes are at the center, as expected
for a symmetric lens. We have to start at the center to measure xo and xi and
apply the thin lens equation with focal length f  3r/2. For the numerical
calculations we use r1  10 and have h  10, and hh  −10. The (0,0) and

1.8.3.2
System of Two Thick Lenses
We consider two thick lenses and assume that lens 1 has the refractive index
n lens 2 the index nn. We also assume that the radii of curvature of the four
spherical surfaces are labeled r1 to r4 and that the distance between lens 1 and
lens 2 is a. The matrix for the system is obtained from the sequence of three
matrices (Figure 1.25).
We start on the right with the thick-lens matrix of the ﬁrst lens, then the
translation matrix, and then to the left the thick-lens matrix of the second lens.
The calculation is shown in FileFig 1.29 and one obtains

We have to set in the product matrix the (0,0) and (1,1) elements equal to one,
and it follows that the (0,1) element is 0. The result of the transformation is:
h  −(1 −M1,1)/M1,0
hh  (1 −M0,0)/M1,0
1/f  −M1,0.
To calculate the image distance for a given object distance, we have to measure
xo from h, xi from hh, and apply the thin-lens equation with focal length f
calculated from −1/f  M1,0.
For a speciﬁc example of a system of two thick lenses we choose a system of
two hemispherical lenses. Each lens is one-half of a sphere, and we assume that
the distance a is zero. The results are the same as we found in Section 1.8.2.4
for a sphere.
In Figure 1.26, we show the two hemispherical lenses with their refract-
ing powers P12 and P45, each of thickness d and a refractive index n with the
corresponding matrices. The details of the calculation are shown in FileFig 1.29.

2. Noncommutation of matrices. In general two matrices A and B may not be

example for a different sequence of the same matrices. We consider two
hemispherical thick lenses where light is coming from the left. The light hits

Plane Mirrors and Virtual Images
A two-dimensional object appears in a ﬂat mirror as a virtual and left–right
inverted image. First we look at one reﬂected ray (Figure 1.27a). We observe the
law of reﬂection, which says the angle of incidence has the same absolute value
as the angle of reﬂection.

In Figure 1.27b we show the reﬂection of a cone of light, emerging from a
point source. The object point appears to us as it is on the “other side” of the
mirror. Now we look at a three-dimensional object, represented by the arrows of
a right-handed coordinate system. The virtual image produced by the ﬂat mirror
appears as a left-handed coordinate system. This may be seen by comparing the
image of our left hand as it appears in a mirror, with our right hand placed before
the mirror. Similarly one ﬁnds “Ambulance” written on the front of an ambulance
truck written in letters from left to right. A driver in a car before the truck can
read it “normally” in the rear view mirror.

Spherical Mirrors and Mirror Equation
Spherical concave mirrors of diameters of a few meters are used in astronomical
telescopes, replacing the ﬁrst lens, as discussed in Section 1.7 on optical instru-
ments. A real inverted image is produced by a real erect object. Spherical convex
mirrors with much smaller diameters are used for cosmetic applications, where
an erect virtual image is formed from an erect object. Our eye uses a positive
lens for the image formation on the retina, but “sees” the virtual image erect, as
discussed in Section 1.7.

we calculate the image points for given object points and radius of curvature.
The light comes from the left. For xif  −∞, the focus xof  r/2, and since
r is negative for a convex mirror, it is to the left of the mirror. This is the only
focus we have for a concave mirror. The focus is also a singularity. We obtain

MATRICES FOR A REFLECTING CAVITY AND
THE EIGENVALUE PROBLEM
The ﬁrst Ne–He laser used a Fabry–Perot cavity with two ﬂat mirrors at a sepa-
ration of 1 m. It was very difﬁcult to align this cavity, and the ﬁrst alignment was
done by accident. One of the researchers bumped into the table, causing the ﬂat
mirrors to vibrate, and laser action was observed. Later, spherical mirrors were
used to construct easy to align cavities.
For our discussion of laser cavities, consisting of two reﬂecting spherical
surfaces, we ﬁrst look at a periodic lens line, equivalently representing the “round
trips” of the light in a reﬂecting cavity. One section of the lens line is shown in
Figure 1.32, where the forward and backward traveling light are shown sepa-
rately. The next section has the same conﬁguration and the light enters and leaves
each section in the same way. The ﬁrst and third lenses are shared by two sec-

The round trip in the cavity must have the symmetry of the path of the rays at the
beginning and end of a unit cell of the lens line. This corresponds to a mode of
oscillation of the cavity. The eigenvalues of this oscillation are obtained from the
eigenvalues of the product matrix and the calculation is shown in FileFig 1.32.
First the product of the ﬁve matrices is calculated using the symbolic method.
Then the eigenvalues are obtained

The coordinates, used for setting up the matrices, may now be transformed into
a new coordinate system. In this coordinate system the matrix describing the
round trip in the cavity is a diagonal matrix. When the diagonal matrix is a unit
matrix, the light may pass through many round trips and no light will escape.
One calls such a resonator stable, and the condition for stability is where the
magnitudes of the eigenvalues are equal to 1.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1 we described image formation by light, using our model which states
that light propagates along straight lines and utilizes the laws of reﬂection and
refraction. We now consider the wave nature of light. In the famous experiment
by Thomas Young, one observes on a screen an interference pattern, consisting
of bright and not so bright stripes of light. The interpretation of an interference
pattern was done by using an analogy to water waves. However, the water wave
pattern is observed as an amplitude interference pattern whereas the superpo-
sition of light waves, also generated as an amplitude pattern, is observed as an
intensity pattern. Historically, Newton associated the light beams of geometrical
optics with a stream of particles and some scientists attacked Young in his time,
saying that he was diminishing Newton’s work. Today we know that light is an
electromagnetic wave but, in a complementary way, light is also described by
quantum mechanics as an assembly of particles.
In this chapter we use a model for the description of interference phenomena.
We assume that there is always one incident wave when two- or more beam in-
terferometry is discussed. After one has taken into account what happens in the
experimental setup, the waves leaving the setup appear superimposed. The inter-
ference pattern is produced with ﬁnite optical path differences. The calculation
of the optical path difference and the interpretation of the resulting interference
pattern are the main subjects of this chapter. The process of splitting the inci-
dent wave into parts involves diffraction, which we neglect in this chapter as a
secondary effect and discuss in detail in Chapter 3.
In this chapter we use for the incident wave one harmonic wave, a solution of
the scalar wave equation, which is written in Cartesian coordinates as
∂2u/∂x2 + ∂2u/∂y2 + ∂2u/∂z2  (1/v)2∂2u/∂t2,
(2.1)
77

78
2. INTERFERENCE
where v is the phase velocity of light in the medium with refractive index n,
related to the speed of light c in vacuum as v  c/n. The scalar wave equation
follows from Maxwell’s theory. It may also be written in spherical coordinates
∇2u + k2u  0,
(2.2)
where ∇is the differential operator in spherical coordinates, k  2π/λ, and λ
is the wavelength of the light. A simple solution of this equation is a spherical
wave of the type (eikr)/r, where r is the distance from the origin to the ob-
servation point. The spherical wave propagates from its origin in all directions
and its intensity is attenuated by 1/r2. We consider such spherical waves only
conceptually and approximate them at a large distance by plane waves.
The differential equation of the scalar wave equation is linear and superposi-
tion of solutions of the differential equation will again result in a solution. This
is part of the superposition principle. In this chapter we only need the superpo-
sition of a number of monochromatic waves, each of frequency ν, to result in a
monochromatic wave having the same frequency ν.
For our model description we use some results from Maxwell’s theory for
quantitative expressions of the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients of mate-
rials contained in Fresnel’s formulas. In particular, we use the results that waves
pick up a phase jump of π, when reﬂected at an optically denser medium, and
that they travel in the optically denser medium with wavelength λ/n, where n is
the index of refraction. The intensity is calculated either as the time average of
the square of the amplitude or the square of the absolute value of the complex
representation and may be normalized with an arbitrary constant.
2.2
HARMONIC WAVES
The solution of the scalar wave equation, (Eq. (2.1)), is a function, depending on
the space coordinates x, y, z and the time t. In addition, there may be an arbitrary
phase factor. We consider harmonic waves in vacuum and in an isotropic and
nonconducting medium of index n. However, in most cases, we only need waves
depending on one space coordinate and time. We describe the transverse waves
by vibrating in the u direction and moving in the x direction, having wavelength
λ and time period T .
u  A cos[2π(x/λ −t/T + φ)].
(2.3)
The amplitude u of the wave varies in the x direction, A is the magnitude of
the wave, and φ is a phase constant. The ﬁrst graph of FileFig 2.1 shows the
amplitude u, depending on the space coordinate x for three time instances t and
three phase constants. The second graph shows the dependence on time for three
points in space and three phase constants. The magnitudes A1 to A3 and B1 to

B3 have been assumed to have the same value, and the three phase constants
φ1 to φ3 and 91 to 93 are assumed to be different. Comparing the graphs, one
observes equivalence of the dependence of the cosine function on x/λ and t/T .
Changing the range of variable from x to t, the family of curves depending on x
is similar to the one depending on t.
We may modify x/λ and t/T in such a way that they contain phase constants.
Then, in the “net” expression cos[2π(x/λ−t/T +φ)] we can not distinguish if φ
belongs to the space part or the time part. We show below that for our discussions
on interference we do not need the time dependence and it is eliminated.
The product of the frequency ν and wavelength λ/n is equal to the phase
velocity v  ω/k of the wave propagating in the medium of refractive index n.
The angular frequency ω  2πν, and the wave vector k  2πn/λ, where λ is
the wavelength in vacuum. We may then write Eq. (2.3) as
u  A cos(kx −ωt)
(2.4)
or
u  A cos k(x −ω/kt)  A cos k(x −vt).
The phase velocity in vacuum is c, and in an isotropic medium with refractive
index n it is c/n. The wavelength of “free space” λ is reduced in the medium to
λ/n (see Figure 2.1).

SUPERPOSITION OF HARMONIC WAVES
2.3.1
Superposition of Two Waves Depending on Space
and Time Coordinates
We describe the interference of two waves in a simple way, using the superpo-
sition of two harmonic waves u1 and u2. Both waves will propagate in the x
direction and vibrate in the y direction.
u1  A cos 2π[x/λ −t/T ]
u2  A cos 2π[(x −δ)/λ −t/T ].
(2.5)
We assume that the two waves have an optical path difference δ. At time instance
t  0, the wave u1 has its ﬁrst maximum at x  0, and u2 at x  δ (Figure 2.2).
Adding u1 and u2 we have
u  u1 + u2  A cos 2π[x/λ −t/T ] + A cos 2π[(x −δ)/λ −t/T ].
(2.6)
Using
cos(α) + cos(β)  2 cos{(α −β)/2} cos (α + β)/2
(2.7)
we get
u  [2A cos{2π(δ/2)/λ}][cos{2π(x/λ −t/T ) −2π(δ/2)/λ}].
(2.8)
In FileFig 2.2 we show graphs of the square of Eq. (2.8) for the same time instant
t1 and wavelength λ. We choose a number of optical path differences δ1  0,
δ2  0.1, δ3  0.2, δ4  0.3, δ5  0.4, δ6  0.5, corresponding to the ratios
of the optical path difference to the wavelength between 0 and 1
2. One observes
that the height of the maxima decreases with increasing δ1 to δ6, and shifts to
larger values of x.

depends on δ and λ, but not on x and t. One obtains for δ equal to 0 or a multiple
integer of the wavelength
[2A cos{2π(δ/2)/λ}]2
is 4A2
(2.9)
and for δ equal to a multiple of half a wavelength
[2A cos{2π(δ/2)/λ}]2
is 0.
(2.10)
The ﬁrst factor in Eq. (2.8) may be called the amplitude factor and is used for
characterization of the interference maxima and minima.
One has
maxima for δ  mλ, where m is 0 or an integer
(2.11)
minima for δ  mλ, where m is 1
2 or an integer
(2.12)
and m is called the order of interference.
The second factor is a time-dependent cosine wave with a phase constant
depending on δ and λ. For the description of the interference pattern this factor
is averaged over time and results in a constant, which may be factored out and
included in the normalization constant (see below).
In Figure 2.3 we show schematically the interference of two water waves
with a ﬁxed phase relation. When the interference factor is zero one has minima,
indicated by white strips. They do not depend on time. The maxima oscillate and
appear and disappear along the line in the observable direction.
Maxima and minima are shown in FileFig 2.3 as 3-D graphs. The maxima
are shown for δ  λ, and in the second graph, for δ  λ/2, there is just one
minimum. The maxima show the time dependence of the second factor for each
of the space coordinates. One can estimate that a time average will result in half
the maximum value. The minimum is zero. It is zero for all time.

These are the maxima when considering light. Between the maxima we indicate the two lines
corresponding to the minima. Along these lines the amplitude of the two waves compensate each
other; their sum is zero.

2.3.2
Intensities
The interference pattern of water waves is an amplitude pattern. We may observe
minima and maxima with respect to the level of the undisturbed water surface.
The interference pattern of light shows intensity minima as dark spots in space
and maxima as bright spots. An amplitude pattern shows negative amplitudes,
but an intensity pattern has only positive or zero values. The amplitude pattern
has to be considered ﬁrst; it produces interference. Then we have to obtain the
intensity pattern. We compare the intensity pattern to observations.
For the square of the amplitude of equation (2.8) we have
u2  [2A cos{2π(δ/2)/λ}]2[cos{2π(x/λ −t/T ) −2π(δ/2)/λ}]2
(2.13)
In Section 2.1 we mentioned that for the intensity we use either the time average
of the square of the amplitude or the square of the absolute value, when using
complex notation. In this section we compare these two calculations.

As result, we obtain for the intensity of the wave described in Eq. (2.8),
I  [2A cos{2π(δ/2)/λ}]2(1/2).
(2.16)
This is the square of the ﬁrst factor (Eq. (2.13)) multiplied by 1/2.
2.3.2.2
Complex Notation
Complex notation has its advantages, for example, when adding several har-
monic waves. Then, the intensity is calculated by the product z z∗and the time
dependence is automatically eliminated.
WerewritethesumofthetworealexpressionsofEq.(2.5)incomplexnotation:
z  z1 + z2  A exp i(2π(x)/λ −2πt/T )
+ A exp i(2π(x −δ)/λ −2πt/T ).
(2.17)
Here the real part of z, that is, Re(z), is the amplitude of u of Eq. (2.8). The
superposition of the two waves may be written in complex notation as
z  z1 + z2  A exp{−i2πt/T + i(2π(x)/λ)}
× {1 + exp(−i2πδ/λ −2πt/T )}.
(2.18)
In the second factor of Eq. (2.18) we may factor out exp −i2πδ/2λ and then
have
z  A exp{−i2πt/T + i(2π(x)/λ)} exp(−i2πδ/2λ)
× {exp i2πδ/2λ + exp −i2πδ/2λ}.
(2.19)
Using
{exp i2πδ/2λ + exp −i2πδ/2λ}  2 cos 2πδ/2λ
(2.20)
one gets
z  A exp{−i2πt/T + i(2π(x)/λ)} exp(−i2πδ/2){2 cos 2πδ/2λ}.
(2.21)
For simplicity we collect all phase factors into one term, call
exp{−i2πt/T + i(2π(x)/λ) −i2πδ/2λ}  exp i9,
(2.22)

86

and have
z  [2A cos(2πδ/2λ)] exp i9.
(2.23)
For the intensity we use the square of the absolute value of z, that is, the product
of z times its complex conjugate z∗,
z z∗ [2A cos(2πδ/2λ)] exp i9[2A cos(2πδ/2λ)] exp −i9
(2.24)
or
z z∗ [2A cos(2πδ/2λ)]2.
(2.25)
Comparing the intensity in Eq. (2.16) with Eq. (2.25), one sees that they
are different by the factor 1
2. This factor 1
2 is not signiﬁcant, since one usually
normalizes the results for the calculation of interference and diffraction pattern.

on x, and appearing at a constant. The “fringe pattern” is plotted (i.e., zz∗),
depending on the optical path difference.
I4COSINTS is only on the CD.
2.3.3
Normalization
To compare an interference pattern with observation, one may normalize both.
Let us assume we have an interference pattern with a maximum in the center.
The scale of the observation data may be changed in such a way that at the center
one has the intensity equal to 1. The intensity calculated from the formula will
also be changed: one divides by the value calculated at the center, and obtains
also for the intensity 1. For example, let us assume that an interference pattern
is described by f (x) and that for x  0 we have f (0)  b. Then writing
I(x)  f (x)/f (0)  I0f (x)
(2.26)
with I0  1/b results in I(x) equals 1 for x  0.
In FileFig 2.4 we have plotted the real part of u and the time average and
compared it with zz∗, which is independent of time. We also plot what one may
call the “fringe pattern,” that is, zz∗, depending on the optical path difference.

2.4.1
Model Description for Wavefront Division
The classical experiments by Young, Fresnel, and Lloyd were performed to
demonstrate the wave theory of light. All three experiments use one incident
wave and divide the light from the source into two waves. The two waves are
superimposed after an optical path difference is introduced and a pattern showing
the maxima and minima is observed. One calls such a pattern, consisting of max-
ima and minima, a fringe pattern. The process of splitting up the incident wave at
two small openings into two new waves involves diffraction, considered in detail
in Chapter 3. The incident wave we consider is monochromatic, propagates in
the x direction, vibrates in the y direction, and has a large lateral extension in the
z direction. The experimental setup produces two waves by wavefront division,
propagating under an angle with respect to each other (see Figure 2.4a). When
we observe the interference pattern at a faraway screen (see Figure 2.4b) the
FIGURE 2.4

have a constant phase relation: (a) geometry of the experiment with water waves (see also Figure
2.3); (b) Observation at a screen far away from the source; (c) using a lens to reduce the distance
X in (b) to distance X′ in (c). In this case only parallel rays meet at one point in the focal plane of
the lens.

2. INTERFERENCE
FIGURE 2.5
Schematic of Young’s experiment. Light is emitted by the source S0: (a) according to
Huygen’s principle, the ﬁrst aperture A1 produces a spherical wave which generates two spherical
waves with ﬁxed phase relation at S1 and S2 and produces a fringe pattern; (b) coordinates for the
calculation of the fringe pattern generated by screen 2 and observed on screen 3. The two openings
on screen 2 are separated by a. The distance from screen 2 to screen 3 is X and the coordinate on
screen 3 is Y.
angles θ and θ′ are almost equal. We therefore approximate the propagation by
assuming that the two waves move in parallel, and that the optical path difference
δ is the same as it was when moving under an angle. We describe both waves
in the same coordinate system and use for the intensity of their superposition
I  I0[A cos(2πδ/2λ)]2 (see Eq. (2.25). In Figure 2.4c we show the observation
in the focal plane of a lens, giving us the opportunity to have the distance between
the experimental setup and the observation screen signiﬁcantly shorter.
2.4.2
Young’s Experiment
The setup of Young’s experiment is schematically shown in Figure 2.5a. The
light from a source S0 travels to screen 1, which has a small hole. At the hole, a
spherical wave is created and travels a large distance. The wave arrives at screen
2 as “almost” a plane wave. At two small holes on screen 2, P1 and P2, the
incident plane wave is split into two spherical waves. The two spherical waves
travel a large distance and arrive at screen 3 as “almost” plane waves. Their
wavefronts are tilted by a small angle with respect to each other, resulting in
an optical path difference and superposition results in a fringe pattern. In our

2.4. TWO-BEAM WAVEFRONT DIVIDING INTERFEROMETRY
89
model calculation, we assume that the two monochromatic waves, leaving the
two openings, travel in parallel in the same direction. They have the angle θ with
respect to the symmetry axis and the optical path difference δ (see Figure 2.5),
δ  a sin θ.
(2.27)
In the small angle approximation we have δ  aY/X, and obtain the intensity
of the fringes on the observation screen, using Eq. 2.25
I(Y)  I0[cos{(πaY)/(Xλ)}]2.
(2.28)
Constructive interference is observed for

The graph in FileFig 2.5 shows the intensity for Young’s experiment, depending
on Y, using the coordinate on the observation screen. One observes that there
is a maximum at the center. In Figure 2.6, a photograph shows the interference
pattern of Young’s experiment and an experimental setup for its observation.

separation of the holes on screen 2 (see Figure 2.5), are three orders of magnitude
larger than the wavelength and four orders of magnitude smaller than the distance
between screens 2 and 3.

Y/X is the angle under which we observe the fringes.
2.4.2.1
Lloyd’s Mirror
In the experiment by Lloyd, interference fringes are produced by using one
mirror. Two parts of the incident wave are superimposed. One part travels directly
from the source to the observation screen, while the other part is incident on the
mirror and is reﬂected under a grazing angle (see Figure 2.7). For the calculation
of the optical path difference δ, we use a virtual source S′ at distance d/2 from
the plane of the mirror, but on the “other side” of the mirror. Similarly, as in
Young’s experiment, we have for the optical path difference δ  Ya/X, and
consider the two waves traveling parallel to the observation point. One has to take
into account that one of the two superimposed waves has picked up a phase shift
FIGURE 2.7
Optical schematic for Lloyd’s mirror experiment drawn with exaggerated size of the
angles. One wave from the source travels directly to the observation point; the other is reﬂected
at the mirror. Since the distance of the source from the plane of the mirror is very small the ﬁrst
fringe is about in the plane of the reﬂecting surface. It is a minimum because of the phase shift.

2.4. TWO-BEAM WAVEFRONT DIVIDING INTERFEROMETRY

of π upon reﬂection on the mirror. This phase shift appears as π in cos{2π(x/λ−
t/T ) + π}, and after superposition, as π/2 in the amplitude factor used for the
intensity. We therefore have
I(Y)  I0[cos{π(Ya/Xλ) + π/2}]2.
(2.31)
For constructive interference one has
δ  Ya/X + λ/2  0, λ, 2λ, . . .
(2.32)
and for destructive interference
δ  Ya/X + λ/2  λ/2, 3λ/2, 5λ/2, . . .

The graph in FileFig 2.6 shows the intensity of Lloyd’s mirror experiment
depending on Y, the coordinate on the observation screen. In comparing Young’s
experiment to Lloyd’s, one has a minimum at the center.

the phase shift upon reﬂection of one of the two waves. The dependence of the
fringes on a and λ are the same as in Young’s experiment.
I6LOYDS is only on the CD.
2.4.2.2
Fresnel’s Double Mirror Experiment
Fresnel’s mirror experiment was originally performed to prove the wavelike
character of light. Even today it is of some interest since the fringes depend on
the tilting angle of the mirrors and may be applied to wavelengths as short as
Xrays. The wavefront of the spherical wave, emerging from the source, is divided
by two mirrors, which are tilted by a very small angle β (Figure 2.8a). Each part
of the incident wave is reﬂected, and the two wavefronts are tilted by the angle
β. The superposition produces the fringe pattern. In our model description we
consider the waves at the faraway observation screen as parallel. The optical
path difference is the same as calculated when the two waves travel under the
small angle β. Making these assumptions, the optical path difference is obtained
using the two virtual source points S′
1 and S′
2 at distance a (see Figure 2.8a). It
is similarly done as for Young’s experiment (Figure 2.8b). The distance from
the virtual sources to the observation screen is c + f  X, and the optical path
difference δ  a(Y/X) of the light reﬂected by the two Fresnel mirrors is
δ  (Y2b sin β)/(c + f ).

“other b” with the other mirror, and remembering that light is reﬂected by 2β if the mirror is tilted

TWO-BEAM AMPLITUDE DIVIDING
INTERFEROMETRY
2.5.1
Model Description for Amplitude Division
We again assume a monochromatic wave incident on the experimental setup,
propagating in the x direction, vibrating in the y direction, and having a large
lateral extension in the z direction.
The incident wave is incident on a beam splitter. One part is reﬂected and the
other part is transmitted. One or both parts are manipulated in the experimental
setup to pass through a beamsplitter a second time. Fractions of each part are
superimposed and travel parallel to the observation screen.

2.5. TWO-BEAM AMPLITUDE DIVIDING INTERFEROMETRY
95
The splitting of amplitude division is different from the splitting discussed for
wavefront division. The two waves after wavefront division travel under an angle.
After amplitude division, it can be arranged, that both parts travel in parallel in
the same direction. The difference between wavefront and amplitude division
is related to energy conservation. It is impossible to superimpose two beams in
such a way that all the light travels in one direction.
Theinterferencepatternisobservedatafarawayscreen,andtheintensityofthe
interference pattern is given as I  I0[A cos(2πδ/2λ)]2 (see Eq. (2.25)), where
δ is the optical path difference. The observation may be done in the focal plane
of a lens, making the actual distance between the experiment and observation
screen much shorter.
2.5.2
Plane Parallel Plate
The interference on a plane parallel plate is the model for the description of
interference on thin ﬁlms, used in various technologies such as coating lenses or
mirrors for use with Xrays.
We consider light incident on a plane parallel plate of glass of thickness D
and index of refraction n > 1, and assume n  1 for the media outside the plate.
The incident light, shown in Figure 2.9 at (a), is split at the ﬁrst interface into a
reﬂected and transmitted part (shown at (b). The transmitted light is reﬂected
and transmitted at the second interface (shown at (c) and the reﬂected light is
again reﬂected and transmitted at the ﬁrst interface (shown at (d). We use for
further consideration only the light reﬂected from the ﬁrst interface (shown as
(1)) and the light reﬂected at the second interface, and then transmitted through
the ﬁrst interface (shown as (2)).

2. INTERFERENCE
The path difference between the waves (1) and (2) is
δ  2Dn.
(2.38)
Both waves (1) and (2) travel in the same direction, and (1) picks up a phase
shift of π when reﬂected at the ﬁrst interface. For the calculation of the optical
path difference we have to multiply 2D by n. In addition, we have to take into
account that the reﬂection on the denser medium, that is, the glass, for wave (1)
results in a phase shift of λ, equivalent to λ/2. The optical path difference is then
δ  2Dn + λ/2,
(2.39)
where λ is the wavelength outside of the plate. One has for the intensity
I  I0[cos{π(2Dn + λ/2)/λ}]2
(2.40)
or equivalently
I  I0[cos{π(2Dn)/λ + π/2}]2.
(2.41)
We have for constructive interference
δ  2Dn + λ/2  0, λ, 2λ, . . .
(2.42)
or
2Dn  λ/2, 3/2λ, 5/2λ, . . .
(2.43)
and for destructive interference
δ  2Dn + λ/2  λ/2, 3λ/2, 5λ/2, . . .
(2.44)
or
2Dn  λ, 2λ, 3λ, . . . .
(2.45)
We see that the appearance of maxima and minima depends on the thickness and
the index of refraction of the plane parallel plate. Maxima are obtained for integer
numbers of half a wavelength, minima for integer numbers of a wavelength. One
may observe the interference pattern on a plane parallel plate by looking at a
soap bubble. The ﬁlm of the bubble is curved, but equally thick over a small
area. The colored light we see is produced by individual interference of different
wavelengths on the thin ﬁlm of equal thickness.
The ﬁrst graph in FileFig 2.9 shows the dependence of the fringes on the
thickness of the ﬁlm for ﬁxed wavelength λ and refractive index n  1.5. The
second graph shows the dependence on wavelength for ﬁxed thickness D  0.05
and n  1.5. One observes that there is no interference on the thin ﬁlm when
the wavelength gets too large.

Using a graph for ﬁxed D, start counting maxima at any particular maxima
on the graph. Read from the graph the difference in D between, for example,
5 maxima. Recalculate the wavelength using the value of n.
3. When the wavelength exceeds the thickness of the plate, the last fringe is
observed for a value of λ, depending on D and n. Find the formula.

Wedge-Shaped Air Gap
We consider two glass plates in air with one on top of the other. With a thin
object, we produce a wedge shaped air gap of small angle α. As we did for the
plane parallel plate, we calculate the optical path difference for the two waves
(1) and (2), on the two interfaces of the air gap (Figure 2.10a (side view)). The
optical path difference is
δ  2x tan α,
(2.46)
where α is the angle of the wedge and x the distance from the point where the
plates are touching. The wave reﬂected at the lower plate picks up a phase shift
of π, equivalent to λ/2. For the two waves (1) and (2) one has constructive
interference
2x tan α + λ/2  0, λ, 2λ, 3λ, . . . , mλ
(2.47)
and destructive interference
2x tan α + λ/2  1/2λ, 3/2λ, 5/2λ, . . . , (m + 1/2)λ.

Interference produced by a wedge-shaped air gap is used to determine the uni-
formity of a polishing job, schematically shown in Figure 2.10b. A ﬂat plate is
used to produce an air gap over a plate, which has been polished. If the maxima
and minima are not straight lines, the width of the air gap varies. Deviations of
a fraction of a wavelength can be detected.
One can make a simple experiment with two microscope slides and a plastic
ﬁlm. The ﬁlm is placed at the end of one slide, and a wedge of length approx-
imately 5 cm may be produced with the other microscope slide. Observation
of fringes and their corresponding distances makes it possible to determine the
thickness of the plastic ﬁlm.

Newton’s Rings
A circular interference pattern may be observed if a spherical surface is placed
on a ﬂat surface. The ring pattern is called “Newton’s rings” and may be used
to determine the radius of curvature of the spherical surface. An experimental
setup is shown in Figure 2.11.
A plane convex lens touches a plane parallel plate and an air gap of width D
is formed between the lens and the plate. We call the radius of curvature of the
spherical surface R and the radius of the rings of the pattern r (Figure 2.12). One
has the relation
R2  r2 + (R −D)2.

After solving a quadratic equation, we have for D(r)

trometers use the Michelson interferometer to obtain an interferogram and the
application of the Fourier transform produces the desired spectrum. Chapter 9
discusses Fourier transformation and spectroscopy. In Figure 2.14 we show a
schematic of a Michelson interferometer. The amplitude of the incident beam is
partly reﬂected under an angle of 90◦toward mirror M1, and partly transmitted
in the direction to mirror M2. The beam splitter may be a plane parallel plate,
and the reﬂection and transmission properties of such a plate are discussed be-
low, including all multiple reﬂections. Here we use an idealized beamsplitter
and assume that 50% of the incident light will be reﬂected, that 50% will be
transmitted, and no phase shift will be introduced.
The reﬂected wave travels to mirror M1, where it is reﬂected and travels back
to the beam splitter for a “second splitting.” It has traveled the distance 2x1
between mirror and beam splitter. We call the transmitted part (1), and note
that the reﬂected part travels back to the source. Similarly, the transmitted wave
travels to M2, is there reﬂected, and travels to the beam splitter for a second
splitting. It has traveled the distance 2x2 and we call the reﬂected part (2); the
transmitted part travels back to the source. Parts (1) and (2) are superimposed
and travel to the detector. If the distances 2x1 and 2x2 are not the same, we have
an optical path difference between (1) and (2) of
δ  2D  2(x2 −x1),

If the light from the point source ﬁlls a cone with opening angle @θ, the distance
x2 −x1 depends on the angle θ and a ring pattern will result in the plane of
the observation screen. For the mathematical treatment we fold one beam of the
Michelson interferometer over to the other beam as shown in Figure 2.15a. To
calculate the path difference of the two beams (1) and (2), we use Figure 2.15b
and calculate the path difference using Figure 2.15c. We have for the distances
[ab]  [bc]  D/ cos θ, and for the distance [ac]  [(2D/ cos θ)(sin θ)] 
2D tan θ. The optical path difference δ is then
δ  2[bc] −[ac] sin θ  2D/(cos θ) −2D tan θ sin θ  2D cos θ.

When a fringe is formed by incident light under the same angle of inclination,
one speaks of Heidinger fringes. Heidinger fringes are shown in Figure 2.16. A
cone of light was used with a Michelson interferometer for the observation of the
ring pattern. In FileFig13. we study graphs of the cross-section of the intensity
pattern of Heidinger fringes. They are produced by the Michelson interferometer
for the dependence on the angle θ, for ﬁxed wavelength λ and for ﬁxed thickness
D. We may also produce with the Michelson interferometer fringes of equal
thickness. We fold one beam onto the other beam, as shown in Figure 2.17a, and
then consider a similar positioning as discussed for the plane parallel plate. If one
of the mirrors of the Michelson interferometer is tilted (Figure 2.17b), we have
the same situation as for the wedge-shaped gap (Figure 2.10a). Therefore, the
fringe pattern of the Michelson interferometer with one tilted mirror is similar

Plane Parallel Plate
In Section 5.2 we studied the plane parallel plate and considered only two re-
ﬂected waves (Figure 2.9). We formulated the condition for constructive and
destructive interference, but did not investigate the question, “Where does the
light travel?” when for destructive interference there is no light in the direction
of reﬂection. Now we want to include in our discussion all internal reﬂections of
the plate and calculate the resulting reﬂected and transmitted waves as shown in
Figure 2.18. We show that the reﬂected and transmitted intensity is equal to the
incident intensity. When we have destructive interference for the reﬂected light,
all light is transmitted and vice versa.
The incident wave is assumed to have magnitude A and makes the angle
θ1 with the normal. The plate has thickness D and a refractive index n2. The
refractive index on both sides of the plate is assumed to be 1. The magnitudes
of the reﬂected and transmitted waves are Air and Ait, where i is 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
respectively. The calculation of the optical path difference is done by using

the wave reﬂected on the ﬁrst surface and the wave reﬂected once on the second
surface. We assume that both waves propagate in the same direction and calculate
the optical path difference, (Figure 2.18b) using the distances [ac] and [bc]. One
has [ab]  [bc]  D/ cos θ2 and [ac]  [(2D/ cos θ2)(sin θ2)]]  2D tan θ2.
The optical path difference between A1r and A2r is then
δ  2n2[bc] −[ac] sin θ1  2Dn2/ cos θ2 −2D tan θ2 sin θ1.
(2.64)
Using the law of refraction we get
δ  2Dn2/ cos θ2 −2D tan θ2n2 sin θ2  2Dn2 cos θ2
(2.65)
The same optical path difference is obtained for transmission. We call r12 the
amplitude reﬂection coefﬁcient for a wave incident from medium 1 and reﬂected
at medium 2, with the corresponding intensity R12. Similarly, we call r21 for a
wave incident from medium 2 and reﬂected at medium 1, with the corresponding
intensity R21. The ﬁrst index indicates the medium in which the wave travels.
The second index indicates the medium at which it is reﬂected. Similarly, we
use τ12 for the absolute value of the amplitude of a transmitted wave traveling
from medium 1 to 2 and τ21 in the opposite direction. We deﬁne τ12  √T12
and τ21  √T21, where T12 and T21 are transmitted intensities. From energy
conservation we have that R12 + T12  1 and R21 + T21  1. The phase

we see that the term of the Nth power can be neglected, since the reﬂection

reﬂected amplitude
Ar  Ar12 + Aτ12r21τ21ei@/(1 −r21r21ei@)

At  Aτ12τ21/(1 −r21r21ei@).

r21  r; that is, R12  R21. As result one has 1 −R12  T12  1 −r2  T21 

Fabry–Perot Etalon
A plane parallel plate with reﬂecting surfaces on both sides is called an etalon.
The reﬂecting layers may be made of metal or a structure of dielectric ﬁlms.
We show that for a speciﬁc wavelength at a speciﬁc spacing of two reﬂecting
surfaces, all incident light will be transmitted while a single reﬂecting surface
will transmit only a small amount.

114
2. INTERFERENCE
We start from the treatment of the plane parallel plate and assume that one can
replace the two interfaces with idealized reﬂectors, having the reﬂectivity r.The
medium between these two reﬂectors has refractive index 1. Assuming normal
incidence and using the reﬂectance R  r2 one has from Eq. (2.81),
g2  4R/(1 −R)2.
(2.90)
For normal incidence, one has for @/2,
@/2  2πD/λ.
(2.91)
The reﬂected and transmitted intensities are obtained from Eqs. (2.83) and (2.84):
Ir  g2 sin2(@/2)/(1 + g2 sin2(@/2))
It  1/(1 + g2 sin2(@/2)).
(2.92)
There the mathematical form of It is called the Airy function.
If [sin @/2]2  0 we have the condition of constructive interference for
transmitted light, Ir  0,
δ  2D  0, λ, 2λ, . . . , mλ.
(2.93)
If [sin @/2]2  1 we have a minimum of light transmitted. The condition is
δ  2D  (1/2)λ, (3/2)λ, . . . , (m + 1/2)λ,
(2.94)
wheremisaninteger.ThegraphinFileFig2.16showsthreetransmissionpatterns
for three different absolute values of the reﬂection coefﬁcient. We have chosen
λ  .1 and plotted the transmitted intensity as a function of the spacing D,
for m  1 and r  .7, .9, and .97, respectively. We see that the width of
the transmitted intensity depends on the absolute value of the reﬂectance r of
a single plate and becomes narrower when r gets close to 1. For constructive
interference, that is, when 2D  mλ, it follows that sin2 @/2  0. Therefore
It is 1, independent of the value of r. We may have r so close to 1 that the
transmission of a single plate is almost zero, but the transmission of the pair of
plates at the right distance will be one. At this distance the Fabry–Perot etalon has
a resonance mode. In experimental Fabry–Perot etalons, the peak transmission
will not be exactly one, due to losses such as absorption in the plates. The Fabry–
Perot etalon, using high orders, is applied to investigate with high resolution
details of a spectral line in a narrow spectral range. The dependence of the width
of the spectral line on the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the etalon is shown in the graph
of FileFig 2.17. The transmittance is plotted depending on the wavelength λ for
three different reﬂection coefﬁcients r and ﬁxed distance D.

2.6.3
Fabry–Perot Spectrometer and Resolution
A Fabry–Perot etalon may be used as a spectroscopic device when varying the
spacing between the two reﬂecting surfaces over a small interval. The result is
that the ﬁrst-order resonance wavelength λ0  2D0 is varied around a wave-
length interval and therefore we have for different Di the resonance maximum,
corresponding to λi. Scanning D gives us a maximum depending on λ and we get
the spectral distribution of the incident signal, as one may measure with a grating
spectrometer. Two spectral lines of wavelength difference @λ may be seen sep-
arated or not, depending on the resolution of the Fabry–Perot spectrometer. To
calculate the resolution, that is, the wavelength difference @λ  λ2 −λ1 of the
spectral lines of wavelength λ1 and λ2, we assume λ2 > λ1 (Figure 2.20a). The
two resonance lines are considered resolved when the crossing of the “right” side
of one line with the “left side” of the other line has the value 1
2. This condition
may be expressed, using Eqs. (2.91) and (2.92), as
{1/(1 + g2 sin2[(2π/λ1)(D −ϵ)])}
(2.95)
 {1/(1 + g2 sin2[(2π/λ2)(D + ϵ)])}.
From Eq. (2.95) it follows that
(D + ϵ)λ1  (D −ϵ)λ2.
(2.96)
Using λ1  λ2 −@λ and renaming λ2 as λ, one has λ2ϵ  (ϵ + D)@λ or
λ/@λ  (D + ϵ)/2ϵ.
(2.97)

with sin(2πD/λ)  0 and cos(2πD/λ)  −1,
1 + g2[sin(2πϵ/λ)]2  2.
(2.99)
Since ϵ is small we may approximate the sine by the angle and have
g2[(2πϵ/λ)]2  1.
(2.100)
Combining Eqs. (2.97) and (2.99) and assuming ϵ ≪D one gets
λ/@λ  πgD/λ
(2.101)
In ﬁrst order we have for the resonance distance D  λ/2, and obtain for
λ/@λ  πg/2. As mentioned above, πg/2 is called the ﬁnesse F. It character-
izes the resolving power of the Fabry–Perot spectrometer. Considering the order
m (integer) for the resonance distance of λ, that is, D  mλ/2, we have more
generally for the resolving power λ/@λ
λ/@λ  mπg/2.

It depends only on the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the single plate. The inverse, @λ
λ
is called the resolution.

Array of Source Points
We study the interference pattern produced by a periodic array of N source
points, as we would have it when using a grating. We extend Young’s experiment
to more than two small openings and assume that the distance a between adjacent
openings is a constant. In our model description, we assume one incident wave
and neglect the diffraction effect in the process of splitting the wave into N
waves. We call the openings source points and have N waves traveling with the
angle θ to the normal of the array (Figure 2.22). The source points all vibrate
coherently. In other words, the amplitudes have maxima and minima at the same
time and the optical path difference between adjacent waves is the same. From
Young’s experiment, we have for superposition of source points 1 and 2,
u  u1 + u2
 A cos(2πx/λ −2πt/T ) + A cos[2π(x −δ)/λ −2πt/T ],
(2.103)
where δ  a sin θ, or in the small angle approximation δ  aY/X. For N
apertures of distance a we have
u  A cos(2πx/λ −2πt/T ) + A cos[2π(x −δ)/λ −2πt/T ] + · · ·
· · · + A cos{2π[x −(N −1)δ]λ −2πt/T },

We note that unlike the case of the plane parallel plate, we can not ignore the
Nth power in the summation formula. The expression in brackets of Eq. (2.109)
can be rewritten for the numerator as
exp i[2π(−Nδ/2λ)]{exp i[2π(Nδ/2λ)] −exp i[2π(−Nδ/2λ)]}
 exp i[2π(−Nδ/2λ)]{2i sin 2π(Nδ/2λ)}

and for the denominator
exp i[2π(−δ/2λ)]{exp i[2π(δ/2λ)] −exp i[2π(−δ/2λ)]}
 exp i[2π(−δ/2λ)]{2i sin 2π(δ/2λ)}.

u  [A exp i(2π(x)/λ −2πt/T )]

where
ei9  exp i[2π(x/λ) −2π(t/T )] exp[i2π(−Nδ/2λ)] exp[i2π(δ/2λ)].

We take for the intensity uu∗ I, and have
I  A2{sin[2π(Nδ/2λ)]/ sin 2π(δ/2λ)}2.
(2.115)
Substituting δ  a sin θ and taking A2  1/N2 for normalization, we can write
I as
I  {sin(πNa sin θ/λ)/N sin(πa sin θ/λ)}2
(2.116)
or for the small angle approximation with δ  aY/X,
I  {sin(πNaY/Xλ)/N sin(πaY/Xλ)}2.
(2.117)
Equations (2.116) and (2.117) have their main maxima when both numerator
and denominator are zero. This is shown in the ﬁrst graph of FileFig 2.20, where
numerator y(θ) and denominator y1(θ) are plotted separately. One observes be-
tween the main maxima N −2 side maxima and N −1 side minima. From
the trace of the numerator one sees that two of the side maxima do not appear.
They are at the ﬂank of the main maxima, and one side minima is located at the
main maxima. The main maxima and side maxima and minima are shown in the
second graph of FileFig 2.20. The interference pattern generated by an array of
sources has a wide application. It is used in the discussion of Xray diffraction
and is used in the discussion of the diffraction grating.

RANDOM ARRANGEMENT OF SOURCE POINTS
In Section 2.6 we assumed for the calculation of the interference of N source
points that the optical path differences for all waves are equal. The source points
were arranged periodically, having the periodicity distance a. We saw that the
incident intensity was redistributed into main maxima and side maxima and
minima.
We now study the opposite case where the periodicity constant is no longer a
constant but has a random distribution in an interval to be speciﬁed. In Figure 2.23
we have the waves uα propagating in direction θ and the optical path difference
between the (α −1)th and the αth wave is δα (instead of qδ). All δα are not the
same. From the discussion of the periodic arrangement of N source points we
have for the superposition of these waves

In this expression δα/λ may be larger than 1. One subtracts a wavelength from
δα until δ′
α/λ is smaller than 1. The value of the trigonometric functions is the
same, before and after the reduction process. We call γα the reduced value of

in the interval from 0 to 1, we can not use the summation formula as done in
Section 6.4 and furthermore have to consider

This is an important result for the discussion of phenomena having their origin in
periodic and non periodic appearance. In our case of interference, one has for the
non periodic case an “incoherent” addition of the waves. The result is an average
distribution I ∝N, and there is no interference pattern. In the periodic case, the
waves add coherently and an interference pattern is observed. The light appears
as maxima and minima. In FileFig 2.21 we show the incoherent addition of the
waves for the non periodic case. The sum of Eq. (2.122) is plotted depending

INTRODUCTION
We know Huygens’ Principle from introductory physics. It tells us that a “new”
wavefront of a traveling wave may be constructed at a later time by the envelope
of many wavelets generated at the “old” wavefront. One assumes that a primary
wave generates ﬁctitious spherical waves at each point of the “old” wavefront.
The ﬁctitious spherical wave is called Huygens’ wavelet and the superposition of
all these wavelets results in the “new” wavefront. This is schematically shown in
Figure 3.1. The distance between the generating source points is inﬁnitely small
and therefore, integration has to be applied for their superposition.
We discussed in Chapter 2 the superposition of light waves and the resulting
interference patterns. In the division process of the incident wave into parts, we
neglected the effect of diffraction. In this chapter we take into account interfer-
ence and diffraction of the wave incident on an aperture. Optical path differences,

generated between adjacent light waves, are ﬁnite for the superposition process
of interference and inﬁnitely small for diffraction.
If we apply this division process to an open aperture, the incident wave gen-
erates new waves in the plane of the aperture, and these newly generated waves
have ﬁxed phase relations with the incident wave and with one another. We as-
sume that all waves generated by the incident wave propagate only in the forward
direction, and not backward to the source of light. Let us consider the diffraction
on a slit (Figure 3.2). The observed pattern depends on the wavelength and the
size of the opening. A slit of a width of several orders of magnitude larger than
the wavelength of the incident light will give us almost the geometrical shadow
(Figure 3.2a). A slit of width of an order or two larger than the wavelength
will bend the light and fringes will occur; see Figure 3.2b. A slit smaller than the
wavelengthwillshowanintensitypatternwithnofringesanddecreasingintensity

for larger angles; see Figure 3.2c. All openings will show small deformations of
the wavefront close to the edges of the slit (not shown in Figure 3.2).
The model we are using for the description of diffraction is called scalar wave
diffraction theory and uses the Kirchhoff–Fresnel integral. All the waves we
consider are solutions of the scalar wave equation, as used for the discussion of
the interference phenomena in Chapter 2. Here we use spherical waves of the
type Aeikr/r, where A is the magnitude of the wave, r the distance from the
origin, and k  2π/λ. These spherical waves are solutions of the scalar wave
equation
∇2u + k2u  0.
(3.1)
Written in spherical coordinates r, θ, and φ one has
∇2  (1/r2){∂/∂r(r2∂/∂r)} + (terms in θ and φ),
(3.2)
where we have not explicitly given the terms in θ and φ because we only use
spherical symmetric solutions and they do not depend on the angular terms.
There is the question of why we should use a summation process based on
the idea of Huygen’s Principle to describe diffraction theory. Why not solve
Maxwell’s equations with the appropriate boundary conditions? The mathemat-
ical formulation of Huygens’ Principle was performed by Gustav Kirchhoff and
Augustin Jean Fresnel before Maxwell’s theory was developed. It turned out
that the use of the Kirchhoff–Fresnel integral for many applications is so much
easier than solving Maxwell’s equations and applying boundary conditions, that
one just continues to use the scalar wave diffraction theory. The wavelength is
assumed to be smaller than the aperture opening under consideration.
3.2
KIRCHHOFF–FRESNEL INTEGRAL
3.2.1
The Integral
We assume for the summation process of the Huygens’ wavelets, that the primary
wave from the source S has amplitude A and travels distance R in the direction
of the aperture (Figure 3.3). We disregard the time factor for all waves consid-
ered in this chapter. We recall that in Chapter 2 the time factor disappeared when
calculating the intensity. At each point of the aperture a Huygens’ wavelet is gen-
erated, [(1/ρ) exp(ikρ)], and travels only in the “forward” direction (Figure 3.3).
It has the amplitude of the incident wave, that is, {(A/R) exp(ikR)}. We have for
a newly generated wavelet
[(A/R) exp(ikR)](1/ρ) exp(ikρ) exp(iα),
(3.3)
where exp(iα) is a phase factor related to the generation process. However, it is
set to 1.

From experiments we know that there is an angular dependence of the in-

θ is the angle to the normal of the aperture, pointing into the forward direc-

The derivation yields the factor cos θ and shows that the diffracted light is only
traveling in the forward direction. However, there are some problems with the
boundary conditions. A formulation using Green’s function avoids this problem,
but is not necessarily better. For more information, see Goodman, 1988, p. 42.
In the following two sections we apply Eq. (3.4) to a special symmetric ar-
rangement of source and observation points, both at large distances from the

On Axis Observation for the Circular Opening
The diffraction on a round opening is important since most lenses, spherical
mirrors, and optical instruments have circular symmetry. We consider a round

In optics, it is often of interest to study complementary screens or arrays. We

Multiplication of u in Eq. (3.13) by u∗yields the intensity, and taking for the

I  I0λ2/4.
(3.14)
The intensity of Eq. (3.14) depends only on the wavelength, not on the diameter
of the aperture or the distance from it. We have the result that at any point in the
shadow of an aperture stop, we will observe a bright spot.
There is the story that Fresnel presented his wave theory of light to the French
Academy of Sciences. The famous Poisson questioned the validity and argued
that there should be a light spot in the shadow of an illuminated sphere, for
example, a steel ball. Another scientist of the Academy, Arago, made the exper-
iment, observed the spot and presented his ﬁnding to the Academy in support of
Fresnel’s theory, but the spot remains the “Poisson spot.” A photograph of the
Poisson spot and an experimental setup for observation are shown in Figure 3.7.

FRESNEL DIFFRACTION, FAR FIELD
APPROXIMATION, AND FRAUNHOFER
OBSERVATION
In the ﬁrst two applications of the Kirchhoff–Fresnel integral, we have assumed
that the source of light and the observation point are at large distances from
the aperture. How large was not speciﬁed. When assuming that the distance
is “inﬁnitely large,” so large that we essentially have plane waves incident on
the aperture, we are at the approximation used in Chapter 2. When observing
at a screen similarly far away from the aperture, the waves arriving there are
also considered plane waves and are also parallel for their superposition. This is
called far ﬁeld approximation. When we use a lens and observe the diffraction
pattern in the focal plane, we have Fraunhofer diffraction. The mathematical
presentation of far ﬁeld approximation and Fraunhofer diffraction is the same.
In contrast, when the distance from the aperture to the source and observation

3.3. FRESNEL DIFFRACTION, FAR FIELD APPROXIMATION, AND FRAUNHOFER OBSERVATION
135
screen is large but ﬁnite, we speak of Fresnel diffraction. We use small angle
approximation to show the differences in these approaches to diffraction.
3.3.1
Small Angle Approximation in Cartesian Coordinates
Since the distance from aperture to observation screen is large, we may use
small angle approximation for the diffraction angle. We consider the integral in
Eq. (3.4),

(A/R) exp(ikR)(1/ρ) exp(ikρ) cos θ dσ
(3.15)
opening of aperture
and neglect the cos θ factor. The factor (A/R) exp(ikR) is a constant and can be
taken before the integral. Using only a one-dimensional approach for the Y and
y directions, we have further to consider,
u(Y)  C

(eikρ)/ρ dy.
(3.16)
opening of aperture
The coordinates are shown in Figure 3.8, using X for the distance from the
aperture to the screen. Since the distance X between the observation screen and
the aperture is large, we take ρ in the denominator as a constant, but not in the
exponential. We develop ρ using the coordinates of Figure 3.8 and have
ρ 

(Y −y)2 + X21/2
 X + (1/2X)(Y −y)2.
(3.17)
Inserting Eq. (3.17) into (3.16) and including 1/ρ and eikX in a new constant C′,
we have
u(Y)  C′

exp{ik(1/2X)(Y −y)2} dy.

This is called Fresnel diffraction. The integral may be expressed using Fresnel’s
integrals.

In Eq. (3.19) we neglect the quadratic term in y and consider (1/2X)(Y 2) as a
constant and include it in C′′, we have
u(Y)  C′′

e−ik(yY/X) dy.
(3.21)
opening of aperture
This is the far ﬁeld approximation.
3.3.2.3
Fraunhofer Diffraction
Fraunhofer diffracton is also far ﬁeld approximation, but we do not have to go
so far, because we observe the pattern in the focal plane of a lens. In this case we
have to ﬁnd the effect on the wavefront when light is focused on the focal plane
of a lens with focal length f . We obtain the result that one has the same integral
for Fraunhofer diffraction as one has for far ﬁeld approximation.
Small angle approximation was obtained by considering in the integral the
exponent, Eq. (3.19),
ik{+(1/2X)(y2) + (1/2X)(Y 2) −(yY)/X}.
(3.22)
For far ﬁeld approximation we neglected the quadratic term in y and considered
the term in X and Y as a constant.
Now we do not neglect the quadratic term in y and show that this term is
compensated by the effect of the lens (for a detailed discussion see Goodman,
1988, p. 78.) We look at the wavefront passing through the lens. The wavefront

is converging to the focal point of the lens (see Figure 3.9). Over the length y
we have an increasing phase shift γ , which is calculated from
y2 + (f −γ )2  f 2.
(3.23)
Neglecting γ 2 we have for the phase shift
γ  (y2)/2f.
(3.24)
This shift must be subtracted as the phase shift in our integral. We get in the
exponent, that is, Eq. (3.22), with X  f ,
ik{+y2/2f + (1/2f )(Y 2) −(yY)/f } −ik(y2)/2f.
(3.25)
The new quadratic term in y cancels the old one, which we neglected in the far
ﬁeld approximation. We then have to consider
u(Y)  C′′

e−ik(yY/X) dy.
(3.26)
This integral is the same as obtained in the far ﬁeld approximation.
3.4
FAR FIELD AND FRAUNHOFER DIFFRACTION
The far ﬁeld diffraction and Fraunhofer diffraction of the Kirchhoff–Fresnel
integral have the same mathematical appearance. The only difference is that in

138
3. DIFFRACTION
far ﬁeld approximation the diffraction pattern is observed on a faraway screen,
whereas in Fraunhofer diffraction the observation screen is placed at the focal
plane of a lens and that may be closer to the aperture.
We now discuss the diffraction pattern of various geometrical shapes of
apertures. From Eq. (3.4) we have
u(Y)  C

(eikρ) dσ,
(3.27)
where dσ is the surface element of the aperture and 1/ρ has been taken before the
integral, included in C, which contains all constant terms. Note that in Eq. (3.27)
we have not used small angle approximation in the exponent.
3.4.1
Diffraction on a Slit
The diffraction on a slit is important because it is a simple one-dimensional
diffraction problem and appears in the diffraction pattern of all types of gratings
and in other diffraction-related phenomena. The coordinates for the calculation
of the diffraction on a slit are shown in Figure 3.10. We divide the opening into
N intervals @y and sum up all waves traveling in direction θ. In the ﬁrst step
it is assumed that these waves are generated at the limits of all intervals and all
adjacent waves have the same optical path difference δ. This is similar to the
discussion in Chapter 2 for interference on an array (Eq. (2.107)). The optical
path difference between waves of ﬁnite steps is @y sin θ and replacing qδ in the
sum of Eq. (2.107), we have

e−ik(@y sin θ).
(3.28)
Making the step @y inﬁnitesimally small, one gets the integral
u(Y)  C

e−ik(y sin θ) dy,
(3.29)
where C includes all constant terms. The integration is from −d/2 to d/2, and
we have to calculate

or in small angle approximation with sin θ  Y/X,

e−ik(yY/X) dy.
(3.31)
The result of the integration of Eq. (3.31) is
u  Cd sin(πd sin θ/λ)/{(πd sin θ)/λ}.
(3.32)
The normalized intensity is written
I  IO{sin(πd sin θ/λ)/{(πd sin θ/λ)}2.

The diffraction pattern of a slit has a periodic appearance with decreasing
intensity of the maxima. The graph in FileFig 3.2 shows three diffraction patterns.
The wider ones are for the smaller slit openings. In Figure 3.11 we show a
photograph of a diffraction pattern of a slit. In Application FF2 the width of the
diffraction pattern with respect to changes in λ and d is studied.

The main maxima is at Y  0. At that point we have sin 0/0, and a similar
discussion to that presented in Chapter 2 results in I  IO. The angle from
the center of the slit to the ﬁrst minimum of the diffraction pattern is called the
diffraction angle θ  λ/d, and is used when discussing resolution or the Fresnel
number for characterizing the losses of a laser cavity. The side maxima are ap-
proximately at Y/X  (m+1/2)λ/d, which is approximately centered between
the minima. An exact determination is done using FileFig 3.3 and Application
FF3.

to the wavelength. This is a general property one observes for diffraction patterns.
The minima are at mλ/d.

exp −i2π(y/λ)(Y/X) dy,
(3.35)
where we used k  2π/λ.We do the following substitutions

a  d/2λ
(3.36)
and have
u(x)  C
 a2
z1
exp[−i2π(ν)(x)]dν.
(3.37)
To write the integral with integration limits from −∞to ∞we deﬁne the function
Q(ν) as
Q(v)  1 for x between −a and a
Q(v)  0 otherwise.
(3.38)
We then have
u(x)  C
 ∞
−∞
Q(ν) exp −i2π(ν)(x) dν.
(3.39)
The integral u(x) in Eq. (3.39) is the Fourier transform of Q(ν). We may integrate
and obtain
u(x)  C′(sin 2πax)/(2πax)
(3.40)
similar to that obtained in Eq. (3.40). We have the result that the Fourier transform
of the slit function Q(v) with opening width a is the function (sin 2πax)/(2πax)
which is sometimes called a sinc-function. When Q(ν) is not the slit function,
but given as a numerical function or a complicated analytical function, one can
not obtain an analytical expression for u(x) but one can calculate the numerical
Fourier transformation. Most computational programs offer Fourier transforma-
tion. In FileFig 3.4 we write a step function for xi with i  0 to 255, assuming
that xi  1 for 0 to d and otherwise 0, and plot xi as a function of i/255. Here
we consider only half of the slit and do the Fourier transformation cj, shown
as the graph of cj depending on j/255, plotted from 0 to 0.5. Since we cover
with the input data only half of the slit, we get only half of the diffraction pat-
tern. However, because the Fourier transformation is real, and we have used
the fast Fourier transformation (FFT), the Fourier transformation cj shows only
N  128 points. The inverse Fourier transformation results again in 256 points.
More details on this subject are given in Chapter 9 on Fourier transformations.

Rectangular Aperture
The diffraction pattern of the rectangular aperture is easy to calculate as an
extension from one dimension, as used for the slit, to two dimensions. In the
next section we do it in small angle approximation and show that the integral is
useful for the calculation of far ﬁeld diffraction on a round aperture, important
for all optical devices and instruments with circular symmetry.
For the calculation of the diffraction pattern of a rectangular aperture with
dimensions d in the y direction and a in the z direction, we go back to the

the other over the opening a in the z direction.

Circular Aperture
Diffraction on a circular aperture is present on all optical devices and instruments
with circular symmetry. Although diffraction seems to be a minor effect, the size
of astronomical telescope mirrors is large in order to reduce the limitations of
image quality by diffraction. Even the Mount Palomar telescope mirror with a
diameter of about 5 m reduces the image quality of a star by diffraction.
For the calculation of the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture we look at
the integral for the rectangular aperture (Eq. (3.41)) and integrate over a circular
opening

angle from the center of the circular aperture to the ﬁrst minimum of the diffracted
intensity (Eq. (3.52)), is the diffraction angle, equal to 1.22 λ/2a where 2a is the
diameter of the opening. Comparing to a slit, we obtain λ/d, where d is the width
of the slit. One has for the slit the factor 1, instead of 1.22 for the round aperture.
The determination of the factor 1.22 is done in Application FF8. The factor 1.22
appears in catalogues of optical devices to specify limitations by diffraction. A
photograph of the diffraction pattern of a round aperture (Airy disc) is shown in
Fig. 3.15 and a 3-D graph in FileFig 3.7.

A graph of the intensity of the diffraction pattern of a round aperture. By changing
the radius a of the aperture, we see that the width of the diffraction pattern is
inversely proportional to the diameter of the round opening. This is a general
property one observes for the diffraction pattern, as well as the corresponding
Fourier transformation. The size of the pattern is proportional to the wavelength.

the opening d  2a and calculate (R/X)/(λ/d) and get the value 1.22.
4. For comparison of the diffraction angle for a slit and a round aperture, plot
on the same graph for the same choice of parameters the diffraction pattern
of a slit and the diffraction pattern of a round aperture. Take the same value
for the width of the slit and the diameter of the aperture; that is, 2a  d.
Compare the values of the ﬁrst minima and observe that the overall width of
the diffraction pattern of the circular aperture is larger than the one for the
slit. The height for the ﬁrst minimum of the round aperture is smaller than
that for the slit. Note that the plot for the slit is a linear plot whereas the plot
for the round aperture is a radial plot.
3.4.5
Gratings
Gratings are used in spectrometers from the near-infrared to the X-ray region.
They are usually reﬂection gratings with a zig-zag proﬁle and called echelette
gratings. Simple transmission gratings may be produced as plastic ﬁlms as repli-
cas of reﬂection gratings. We discuss the amplitude transmission grating with
larger or smaller transmitting areas at normal incidence or under an angle. We
also discuss a transmission echelette grating with the incident light at a speciﬁc
angle. In the appendix we discuss the step grating because of its potential for use
in Fourier transform spectroscopy.
3.4.5.1
Amplitude Grating
Amplitude gratings are periodic structures with alternating transmissive and
opaque strips. Similar to what we did for single apertures, we now have to
integrate over the open areas of the periodic set of slits (Figure 3.16). The
integration over one slit

P(Y)  {[sin(πdY/Xλ)]/[(πdY/Xλ)]}2
· {sin(πNaY/Xλ)/(N sin(πaY/Xλ))}2.
(3.60)
We have normalized the resulting pattern by division with 1/N2. The intensity
P(θ) of interference and diffraction of the amplitude grating is shown in the
graphs of FileFig 3.9 where we used values such as .001 instead of.000 in the
numerical calculations when approaching 0/0 at θ  0.
The ﬁrst graph shows separately the numerator y(θ) of the interference factor
and on the same graph the intensity I(θ). The numerator y(θ) is zero for the main
maxima and all side minima of I(θ). At the main maximum both the numerator
and the denominator are zero (i.e., one has 0/0), which results in 1, as discussed
for the interference factor in Chapter 2. The second graph of FileFig 3.9 shows the
zeroth order (main maximum) of the interference factor, at θ  0. There are N-1
side minima and N-2 side maxima between main maxima. Two side maxima
do not appear. The second graph P(θ) shows the interference and diffraction
factors separately. The interference factor describes the maxima and minima,
and the envelope of the diffraction factor limits the intensity of the peaks of the
interference factor. The graph in FileFig 3.10 shows the corresponding pattern
for a slit opening 10 times smaller than the periodicity constant a.
For integer ratios of a/d, some maxima of the pattern can be seen while others
are suppressed. Taking as an example a/d  2, the zeroth and ﬁrst orders of the
pattern are seen, and the second order is suppressed. If a/d has the integral value
nth, more orders may be observed and the resulting pattern becomes wider and
the nth order is suppressed.
A photograph of the diffraction pattern for the case of N  2, 3, 4, and 5 is
shown in Fig. 3.17. One observes one side maximum for N  3, two for N  4,
and three for N  5.

at X  0 by using for θ values such as 0.001 instead of 0.000. There are N-1

the two intensity patterns for different values of N.

determine when two peaks of different wavelengths and at different orders
may be resolved depending on choices of N. (For changes in the angle,
we have that 1 rad is about 5 to 6 degrees.)

3.4.5.2
Amplitude Grating with Incidence Light at an Angle
An experimental setup may require that the incident light enter the grating not
in the direction of the normal but under an angle ψ with respect to the grating
surface (Figure 3.19). The only difference now is that the optical path difference
(i.e., a(sin θ) of the two parallel beams; see Eq. (3.54) is enlarged by the term
a(sin θ). One obtains for the intensity
I(θ)  {[sin(πd(sin θ + sin ψ)/λ)]/[πd(sin θ + sin ψ)/λ)]}2
· {sin[πNa(sin θ + sin ψ)/λ]/N sin[πa(sin θ + sin ψ)/λ]}2.
(3.61)
The interference diffraction pattern is similar to the pattern of the amplitude grat-
ing used at normal incidence. The difference is that the main maximum is not at
θ  0. The normalized interference factor is equal to 1 for the main maximum,
that is, for (sin θ + sin ψ)  0, or at sin θ  −sinψ. The zeroth order is shifted
from θ  0 to θ  −ψ. This is shown in the graph of FileFig 3.11.

3.4.5.3
Echelette Grating (Phase Grating)
A transmission grating with periodic differences in thickness is called a phase
grating. When the grating has steps with angle ε, as shown in Figure 3.20, it
is called an echelette grating. It may be produced from materials of refractive
index n or with a metal surface such as a reﬂection grating. To calculate the
interference diffraction pattern of the echelette grating, we have to determine
the optical path difference between equivalent wavelets from neighboring steps
and integrate over all the steps. The result is an interference factor, depending
on the periodicity constant a of the steps and a diffraction factor, depending on

the shape of the step. To make the calculation of the diffraction factor easy, we
assume that the periodicity constant is equal to the width of the steps d and we
choose the angle of incidence such that the transmitted light is refracted in a
direction perpendicular to the plane of the step (Figure 3.20a). The angle ε is
then the angle between the normal of the facet and the normal of the plane of
periodicity. The intensity is again given as the product of the interference and
diffraction factor. The interference factor is the same as the one obtained for the
amplitude grating, but the diffraction factor is calculated with the optical path
difference yi sin(θ + ε); see Figure 3.20. The intensity is then
I(θ)  {[sin(πd sin{θ + ε}/λ)]/[πd sin{θ + ε}/λ]}2
(3.62)
· {[sin(πNa sin θ/λ)]/N sin(πa sin θ)/λ]}2.
The three graphs in FileFig 3.12 demonstrate the dependence on the step angle
ε. When ε  −.25 we see that the maximum of the diffraction factor is lined
up with the ﬁrst-order maximum of the interference factor. The zeroth order of
the interference factor is at the ﬁrst minimum of the diffraction factor and is
suppressed. For the particular wavelength the grating is said to be blazed. For
slightly different wavelengths, the ﬁrst order would be displaced within the enve-
lope of the diffraction factor. Considering a source emitting many wavelengths,
the ﬁrst order of a range of wavelengths is distributed over the range determined
by the diffraction factor.
When changing the step angle ε, one has for ε  .25 that the zeroth order of
the diffraction factor is shifted to the −1 order of the interference factor (see the
second graph of FileFig 3.12). For ε  −.52, the zeroth order of the diffraction
factor is at the +2 order of the interference factor (third graph of FileFig 3.12).
For other values of (between these values, one ﬁnds that the maxima of the
interference factor are not lined up with the maxima of the diffraction factor.
FileFig 3.12
(D12FAELGRS)
Graphs of the intensity of diffraction on an echelette grating. Three graphs are
shown for three values of ε. There is only one interference factor and three
diffraction factors. We see that the diffraction factor is lined up with the ﬁrst
maximum of the interference factor for ε  −0.25. The zero order of the inter-
ference factor is at the ﬁrst minimum of the diffraction factor and is suppressed.
If one applies a source emitting many wavelengths, the ﬁrst-order of a narrow
band of different wavelengths is “ﬁlling” the area of the diffraction factor. For the
wavelength for which both maxima coincide, the grating is said to be “blazed.”
When choosing ε  0.25 the zeroth order of the diffraction factor is shifted to
the −1 order of the interference factor. For ε  −0.52 we have the zeroth order

other values of ε and ﬁnd a misalignment.

Gratingsareusedinspectrometerstoobtainthespectrumoftheincidentlight.Let
us consider incident light containing a spectrum of just two different wavelengths
λ1 and λ2. As an example let us consider the sodium D lines at 5890 and 5896
A◦in the yellow part of the visible spectrum, emitted when the Sodium atom
is at a high temperature. One may observe these lines when salt falls into a gas
ﬂame and one sees yellow light. The wavelength difference of the two lines is
just 6◦and we now discuss the question of what has to be required of a grating to
observe the two separated lines. We consider two lines of wavelength difference
(@λ  λ2 −λ1. The diffraction angles in the ﬁrst order will have maxima at
sin θ1  λ1/a and sin θ2  λ2/a (Figure 3.21a). Assuming λ1 < λ2 we have
to determine how large @λ  λ2 −λ1 must be in order to recognize the two
spectral lines separately. If @λ is large enough, we can recognize these two lines
(Figure 3.21b on the left) and if @λ is too small, we would have just one peak

(Figure 3.21b on the right). To get a quantitative value for the case where the two
lines are just separated, we use the Rayleigh criterion. Which states that the two
maxima of a diffraction pattern are considered separated when the maximum of
one is at the position of the minimum of the other.

the diffraction pattern of a grating for any order

and obtain

(3.64)
Calling λ2 just λ and considering the mth diffraction order, we have
λ/@λ  mN.
(3.65)
Since λν  velocity of the light in the medium, where ν is the frequency, one
also has
ν/@ν  mN.
(3.66)
The ratio λ/@λ or ν/@ν is called the resolving powers of the grating.
The graph in FileFig 3.13 shows two diffracted waves of wavelength λ1 and
λ2 on a grating. The separation of their maxima depends on N and one may
change N to ﬁnd the separation in agreement with the Rayleigh criterion. Also
seen is the dependence of the resolution on the diffraction order. The ﬁrst graph
in FileFig 3.14 shows the diffraction pattern of two round openings of radius a.
One is at zero and the other at distance b. One can determine b using the Rayleigh
criterion. The second graph shows the two spectral lines in three dimensions.
For our example of the sodium D lines we have from Eq. (3.66) about 1000
for mN. In other words, in ﬁrst order we need 1000 lines of the grating. If the
grating has a periodicity constant of about 1 micron, the width of the grating
would be one millimeter. If one could use a larger grating of 10 cm then the
number of lines would be 100,000 and in ﬁrst order, for a wavelength of 5000 ˚A,
@λ would be 0.02 ˚A.

The diffraction angle is calculated from b/X  @θ. The grating is made

1. Convert to a surface plot and make b such that the maximum of one of the
peaks is on the minimum of the other. Then go back to the contour plot.
2. We have used the same wavelength for both peaks. After determining the
wavelength resolution, introduce the corresponding wavelengths into the two
expressions of the Bessel function and estimate the change.
3. Assume that the angle difference for resolution is given for order m and ﬁnd
the wavelength difference.

BABINET’S THEOREM
Babinet’s Theorem tells us that two complementary screens will give us the
same diffraction pattern at the observation screen. Complementary screens are
two screens, one of which is transparent at areas where the other is opaque
(Figure 3.23). If the two complementary screens are placed together in the same
plane, no aperture will exist.

3.5. BABINET’S THEOREM
165
FIGURE 3.23
Examples of complementary screens.
The general appearance of the diffraction pattern on the observation screen is
the same, regardless of one screen having larger openings than the other.
Let us consider two gratings, both having periodicity constant a. One has
a width of opening d1 and the other of d2. These gratings are complementary
screens when d1+d2  a. To get the diffraction pattern, we apply the Kirchhoff–
Fresnel integral to the openings of each screen. The two integrals must add up to
zero since there are no openings to integrate. We assume there is a single wave
incident on all openings and use far ﬁeld approximation,

and have for the amplitudes

or
ϕI(Y)  −ϕII(Y),
(3.68)
and for the intensities
[ϕI(Y)]2  [ϕII(Y)]2.
(3.69)
The diffraction pattern of the two screens has the same overall appearance. The
ﬁrst equation tells us that the two diffraction patterns are “out of phase” by 180

degrees and the second one tells us that the diffraction patterns of the two screens
are similar.
In Figure 3.24 we show schematically the diffraction pattern of two comple-
mentary screens. One screen is made of open squares and the other of black
squares. In FileFig 3.15 we consider two amplitude gratings with complementary
open areas as complementary screens. The appearance of the diffraction pattern
is the same, but the heights of the peaks are different. We assumed that d1 is
different from d2 and therefore the open areas are different.
FileFig 3.15
(D15FABAGRS)
Two complementary screens are considered. Both are amplitude gratings of peri-
odicity constant a. One has the width d1 of open strips, the other the width d2, and
since we assume that a  d1+d2 the screens are complementary. The diffraction
patterns are shown as P1 for the grid with d1 and P2 for the grid with d2. One
observes that the diffraction patterns are similar. Both patterns have peaks at the
same location. However, they have different intensities. The different intensities
result from the different d1 and d2 values and consequently different areas of
integration.

We see that the intensity of the diffraction peaks is different for the two com-
plementary patterns, but the position of the peaks is the same, and that is what
Babinet’s Principle tells us.
Application 3.15.
1. Keep a  d1+d2 constant and change the width d1 to a much smaller value
than d2. Check how the intensities of the two patterns are affected.
2. For comparison, make d1 and d2 about equal.
3. Change the constant “a” to see how the pattern is changing.
3.6
APERTURES IN RANDOM ARRANGEMENT
In Chapter 2 we studied the interference pattern of an array and found that the
pattern disappears when the array is changed to a random arrangement. We now
study the question of what happens to an interference diffraction pattern if we
assume a random arrangement.
We consider an amplitude grating and want to describe the changes of the
interference diffraction pattern when we change the periodic array into a random

168

arrangement. The diffraction pattern is described by the product of the diffraction
and interference factors
Pperiodic  {[sin(πd sin θ/λ)]/[(πd sin θ/λ)]}2
· {[sin(πNa sin θ/λ)]/(N sin(πa sin θ/λ)]}2.
(3.70)
As discussed in the chapter on interference, the interference factor will average
to a constant when the change to the random array of apertures is done and we
are left only with the diffraction factor
Prandom  {[sin(πd sin θ/λ)]/[(πd sin θ/λ)]}2.
(3.71)
The random array of many openings of width d will give us the diffraction pattern
of a slit at the observation screen.
In FileFig 3.16 we have a one-dimensional calculation. The ﬁrst graph shows
the interference diffraction pattern of a grating, and the second graph shows what
is left if the interference factor disappears. In FileFig 3.17 we show the diffraction
patternofa2-Dgratingasa2-Dcontourplot.Theﬁrstgraphshowsthediffraction
pattern of the periodic arrangement and the second graph shows the diffraction
pattern of the random arrangement. This is schematically shown in Figure 3.25
for periodic and random arrangements of square apertures. The periodic arrange-
ment shows the interference diffraction pattern, and the random arrangement
appears as the superposition of the intensity diffraction pattern of squares.

The product P1 of a diffraction and interference factor for a one-dimensional

FRESNEL DIFFRACTION
At the beginning of this chapter we used Fresnel diffraction for the calculation
of the Poisson spot. The Kirchhoff–Fresnel integral was applied to a round stop
and we found a constant illumination in the shadow of the round aperture on
the axis of the system. We are now interested in discussing the diffraction on
an edge, which was done by Fresnel using the integrals named after him. The
ﬁrst steps are to study the Fresnel diffraction on a slit and give the deﬁnitions of
Fresnel’s integrals.

Fresnel Diffraction on a Slit
Fresnel diffraction on a slit is calculated using the coordinates of a slit of width
d as shown in Fig. 3.26. From Eq. (3.73) and (3.76) we have for the amplitude
at the observation point
G(Y)  C[η2(Y)] −C[η1(Y)] + i{S[η2(Y)] −S[η1(Y)]},

The graph in FileFig 3.19 shows Fresnel diffraction on a slit. One observes
that for the parameters used, the ﬁrst minimum of the pattern is not zero. By
changing d to a smaller value or X to a larger value, one may get to a zero value
for the ﬁrst minimum.

slit width, the Fresnel diffraction is not zero for the ﬁrst minimum.

Step Grating
A grating with a rectangular reﬂecting surface is called a step grating. The grating
has the periodicity constant a, and the reﬂecting surfaces of length a/2 are
positioned in two planes. Such a grating may be produced by using two sets of
interpenetrating gratings, shown schematically in Figure A3.29. The distance
H between planes I and II may be varied, and the corresponding interference
diffraction pattern, depending on the height of H, is called an interferogram. As-
suming that the incident light contains many wavelengths, the application of a
Fourier transformation to the interferogram results in a spectrum.
We discuss here the step grating as shown in Figure A3.29b for a ﬁxed step
height H. The incident light is reﬂected at planes I and II and travels in direction
θ. At a faraway screen, one observes an interference diffraction pattern. We
calculate the diffraction pattern on the array of N steps, having width d, step
height H, and periodicity constant a.
Each of the two interpenetrating gratings produces the pattern of an amplitude
grating and, in addition, we have the interference of the light from planes I
and II in the direction of the observation screen. The optical path difference
is δ  d sin θ + H and in order to get the intensity of the interference (see

on a step grating. Only the emerging diffracted light is shown for the calculation of the path
difference. The two gratings in planes I and II interfere with each other in the X direction.
Chapter 2, Eq. (2.8)), we have to insert this path difference δ into [cos(πδ/λ)]2.
The intensity P  uu∗of the diffraction and interference of each grating and
the interference of the two gratings with each other is then the product of the
diffraction factor

The diffracted intensity is

· [cos{π/λ)(d sin θ + h)}]2.
(A3.4)
The diffraction pattern depends not only on d and a, but also on H. The graph of
FileFig A3.21 shows P(θ) for several values of H and also the diffraction factor
D(θ). The diffraction factor supplies the envelope and the interference factor
supplies the lines. The zeroth order is at the center and the ﬁrst order is within
the envelope. Since we necessarily have 1:2 for the ratio d/a, the second order
is suppressed by the zeros of the diffraction factor. Variation of H will redis-
tribute the intensity between the zeroth and ﬁrst order. This may be understood
from energy conservation. We assume that the third and higher orders may be
neglected. Then for H  0, the incident light is reﬂected into the zeroth order,
that is, in the direction of reﬂection on the mirror surface. When H  λ/4, no
light can travel in the direction of the zeroth order. In other words, no light may
be reﬂected on the surface of the grating facets and all light travels into the ﬁrst
order. For H  λ/2 we have again reﬂection on the grating facets.
For H being a multiple of the wavelength, all light is diffracted into the zeroth
order and for H being a multiple of half a wavelength, all light is diffracted into
the ﬁrst order. The graph in FileFig A3.21 shows the intensity pattern P(θ) for
two different wavelengths. One observes only one peak for the zeroth order, but
two peaks for the ﬁrst order. The zeroth order changes its intensity depending
on H. Recording the intensity depending on H will reveal the interferogram.
FileFig A3.21
(DA1FAGSTEP1S)
There are four intensity patterns P1 to P4, each for a different value of H.
The values of H are presented as H  nλ. When n is an integer, we have all
light in the zeroth order. For noninteger values of n, we subtract from λ all full
wavelengths and look at the remaining fraction n′. For example, if n  10.5, we
look at n′  0.5. The optical path difference is now half a wavelength and all the
light is diffracted in the ﬁrst orders. For values such as 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375
there is light partly diffracted into the zeroth and the ﬁrst order.
DA1FAGSTEP1S is only on the CD.

1. Find the values of n for which the patterns of constructive and destructive
interference are repeating for values of n from 0 to 2. Observe that the path
difference between constructive and destructive interference is λ/2, and the
successive constructive or destructive interference pattern is λ. These length
differences correspond to the length differences produced by H.

There are four intensity patterns P1 to P4, each for a different value of H1 to

have been chosen such that P1 and P2 show the constructive interference pattern
for λ1 and λ2, and H3 and H4 that P3 and P4 show the destructive interference
pattern for λ1 and λ2.
DA2FAGSTEP2S is only on the CD.
Application A3.22.
1. Get FileFig 3.A2 on the screen and save it. Then modify P1 to P4 such that
all H have the same height. Now we can simulate the lamellar grating inter-
ferogram for two wavelengths λ1  0.0005 and λ2  0.0007 by changing
from H  0.00005 in steps of 0.00005 and see how the constructive and de-
structive interference patterns change on the observation screen for the two
wavelengths. An interferogram can be obtained by observing the center and
recording the sum of the intensities for the two wavelengths.
2. We go back to FileFig 3.A2. The four patterns show constructed and destruc-
ted interference for different settings of the lamellar grating. In other words,
all four patterns using H1 to H4 are different. For the two wavelengths, we
have the constructed interference at the center. Destructive interference ap-
pears at different length Y from the center on the observation screen. Since
the detector should only observe the zero order, one has to choose the size
such that the ﬁrst orders are not detected.
3. What is the diameter of the detector area when the smallest wavelength is
λ1  0.001 and the largest wavelength λ2  0.004?
4. What are the changes of the detector area, when changing a to 2a or 1

Cornu’s Spiral
A graph of the Fresnel integrals S versus C is called a Cornu spiral (FileFig
3.A3). One can graphically obtain a diffraction pattern from Cornu’s spiral. As

an example we discuss the diffraction on a slit. The intensity is given by
I(Y)  {C[η2(Y)] −C[η1(Y)]}2 + {S[η2(Y)] −S[η1(Y)]}2
(A3.5)
and depends on the points η1(Y) and η2(Y), assuming that d, λ, and X are given.
I(Y) is the square of the geometrical distance on the Cornu spiral between the
points η1 and η2. The diffraction pattern is obtained by plotting (distance)2 as
a function of Y for η1 and η2. By the division of all values by (distance)2 for
Y  0 one can obtain a normalized pattern.

Babinet’s Principle and Cornu’s Spiral
We consider two complementary screens, I and II. Screen I may just have a hole
and screen II has a stop of the same size as the hole. If added together, no light may
pass. Babinet’s principle tells us that complementary screens generate similar
diffraction patterns. In FileFig 3.A3 we have plotted one-half of the Cornu spiral
for η from 0 to ∞. Let us consider a slit and the complementary screen, a stop of
the same width. The diffraction pattern of screen I for one point Y is obtained by
measuring the length between the corresponding points η1 and η2 (as discussed
FIGURE A3.30
Cornu’s spiral. The line(b) corresponds to the diffraction pattern of a slit and (a)

above) which we call length (b) (see Figure A3.30). The diffraction pattern of
screen II may be obtained by using the distances (a) from −∞to η1 and (c)
from η2 to ∞. If we want to get the diffraction pattern on a different point Y, the
points η1 and η2 are displaced in correspondence with the choice of the Y-value
and will affect the diffraction pattern for both screens in the same way.
The distances (a) and (c) and the distance (b) from η1 to η2 represent the
diffraction pattern for the addition of the two complementary screens for which
no diffraction pattern can be observed.

Introduction
In the chapter on interference, we always considered only one incident wave
and assumed that it was emitted by a distant point source. Recalling Young’s
experiment, the incident wave generated two new waves at the two openings at
distance a of a double slit screen. The two new waves had a ﬁxed phase relation
and their superposition generated the interference pattern. The two waves were
called coherent waves. In our model description we used two monochromatic
waves with a ﬁxed phase relation. The superposition generated the amplitude
interference pattern, and the corresponding intensity pattern could be related to
observations.
In this chapter we study waves emitted independently from several distant
sources and assume that there is no ﬁxed phase relation among them. Using for
the analysis the double slit aperture of Young’s experiment, one may observe an
intensity interference pattern for speciﬁc distances of the source points between
them. However, one may also choose other speciﬁc distances, and one will not
ﬁnd an intensity interference pattern. It is common to call the light of the same
sources “spatially coherent” when an intensity interference pattern is observed
and “spatially incoherent” when the intensity interference pattern disappears.
4.1.2
Two Source Points
Let us look at a double star, where each star emits its light independently of
the other. The waves of both are incident on a screen of two slits of width d
and separation a of Young’s experiment. In Figure 4.1, this is shown (without
diffraction) for one source point S1 positioned on the axis and for a second source
point S2 at distance s from the ﬁrst.

(a) Superposition of two of Young’s experiments using separate sources S1 and S2.
The distance between the sources is s and both “use” the same separation a of the double slit. The
distance from the sources to the aperture is Z, and to the observation screen is X; (b) light from
S2 has the angle ψ with the axis and is diffracted into the angle θ.
For each source point we have an intensity diffraction pattern and for the two
source points we look at the superposition of two intensity patterns. We assume
in our model calculation that each source point generates a monochromatic wave
of wavelength λ and both are incident on the double slit aperture. The light from
source point S1 produces on the observation screen the intensity
I(θ, 0)  I0{sin[(πd/λ) sin θ]/[(πd/λ sin θ]}2{cos[(πa/λ) sin θ]}2,
(4.1)
where θ is the diffraction angle and Io is the normalized intensity. Equation
(4.1) is obtained from the discussion of the double slit (Chapter 3, FileFig 3.10).
For source point S2, the axis of the double slit experiment is rotated by the
angle ψ around the point at the center between the two openings. As a result, the
diffraction angle is counted from the new axis and we have to use d(sin θ −sin ψ)
and a(sin θ −sin ψ) in the diffraction and interference factors of Equation (4.1),
respectively. For the intensity of the light from point S2 we have
I(θ, ψ)  I0{sin[(πd/λ)(sin θ −sin ψ)]/[(πd/λ)(sin θ −sin ψ)]}2
· {cos[(πa/λ)(sin θ −sin ψ)]}2.

4.1. SPATIAL COHERENCE

The calculation of the optical path difference is similar to the calculation of the
optical path difference for a grating, illuminated under an angle to the normal
(see Chapter 3, Eq. (3.61)). In this model of spatial coherence, monochromatic
light from each point source uses the same double slit aperture and generates an
intensity fringe pattern. The waves from each source point have no ﬁxed phase
relation between each other and each produces an intensity fringe pattern of its
own. The intensities of these two fringe patterns are superimposed. Whether
fringes can be observed depends not only on the separation s (and consequently
on ψ) and the wavelength, but also on the separation a of the two slits in the
double slit arrangement. However, this separation “a” is assumed to be constant.
In FileFig 4.1 we calculate the superposition of the intensity pattern depending
on the separation of the two source points. The separation s is taken in “common
length units” as discussed in Chapter 1. The ﬁrst graph shows the intensity
interference pattern for both source points at the same spot, that is, for s  0.
Thesecondgraphshowsthereducedinterferencepatternforthedistancebetween
the two source points of s  1.5. The third graph shows the disappearance of
the intensity pattern at the distance of s  2.25 and the fourth graph shows the
reappearance at s  2.6. We see that the superposition of the intensity pattern,
produced by the two sources with incoherent light, cancel for the speciﬁc distance
between the two source points of s  2.25.
When fringes are observed of the superposition of the two intensity fringe
patterns, one calls the light producing the fringe pattern spatially coherent. When
no fringes are observed, the light is called spatially incoherent.
FileFig 4.1
(C1COH2S)
Graphs are shown for the superposition of the intensities I(θ, 0) and I(θ, ψ) for
two point sources at variable distances s as a function of the angle θ. Parameters
used are the separation of the two openings a  1 mm, opening of the slits
d  0.05mm, wavelength λ  0.0005 mm, distance from source to double slit
Z  9000 mm, and distance from aperture to observation screen X  4000 mm.
Four distances are used, s  0, s  1.5mm, s  2.25mm, and s  2.6mm,
of separation s  Zψ of the two source points, corresponding to four values
of ψ. Fringe patterns are observed for separations s smaller than 2.25 mm. For
s · ψ  λ/2, that is, s  2.25 mm, we have for the ﬁrst time disappearance of
fringes; that is, the maxima of I(θ, ψ) are at the minima of I(θ, 0). For s larger
than 2.25 mm the fringe pattern reappears.

disappearance. If ψ is further enlarged, the fringes reappear, but now the minima
are not zero. Another point of view: fringes may disappear for constant s and

Coherence Condition
We have seen that the two source points produce superimposed intensity patterns
for certain distances s between them. In our case we found fringes for distance
s  0, and for a larger distance s  2.25mm, the fringes disappeared. For a
small separation s of the two source points, one would observe fringes similar to
the pattern produced by one source point. The coherence condition tells us how
large one can make the separation s and still have a fringe pattern similar to the

188
4. COHERENCE
one produced by one source point only. For the discussion, we assume that the
openings of the two slits are very small and therefore we may omit diffraction.
We then have for the pattern generated by sources S1 and S2,
I1(θ, 0)  I0{cos[(πa/λ) sin θ]}2
(4.3)
I2(θ, ψ)  I0{cos[πa/λ)(sin θ −sin ψ)]}2.
(4.4)
The center of the pattern of I1 is at (a sin θ)  0 and the ﬁrst minimum is at
(a sin θ)  λ/2. We want to ﬁnd the magnitude of the angle ψ for which we will
see only one fringe pattern. If the center of the pattern of I2 is at the minimum of
I1 (i.e., for (a sin ψ)  λ/2), the angle ψ is too large and we are at the position
where fringes disappear for the ﬁrst time. Therefore, in order to observe just one
fringe pattern of the superposition of I1 and I2 we have to require that
(a sin ψ) ≪λ/2.
(4.5)
Equation (4.5) may also be written in good approximation as s ·a/Z, where a/Z
is the opening angle ω from the source points (Figure 4.2) and one has
s · a/Z  s · ω ≪λ/2.
(4.6)
The opening angle ω seen from the middle of the two source points is given as
a/Z and the product of this angle times the separation s of the source points
must be small compared to half of the wavelength. We state this as
(source size) times (opening angle ω) must be ≪λ/2.
(4.7)
This is called the coherence condition.

similar to that of a pointlike source.

Extended Source
The discussion of the double star was the ﬁrst step in investigating the question
of how far away a source has to be to qualify as a point source, even if it has a
ﬁnite diameter. To discuss an extended source we look at a line source made of a
sequence of point sources. The distance between the source points is considered
inﬁnitesimally small, but there is no ﬁxed phase relation between the light of one
source point with respect to any other. We apply to the line source what we have
done for two source points, and now have to integrate I(θ, ψ) over the angle ψ
from 0 to ψs  s/Z

(4.8)
The integration may be interpreted as the superposition of the intensity fringe
pattern, produced by all source points between S1 and S2. The upper integration
limit, that is, the angle s/Z, is taken as such a numerical value that we can
compare the angles with calculations of the fringes for the two point sources.
The ﬁrst graph in FileFig 4.2 shows the intensity interference pattern for a line
source of length s  1 mm. The second graph for the length of s  1.5 mm again
shows a fringe pattern. The third graph shows the disappearance of the intensity
pattern at a length of s  4.5, and the fourth graph shows the reappearance at
s  5. We see that the integrated intensity pattern is produced by an extended
source of length s  4.5 mm. All fringes cancel for s  4.5 mm. This value is
twice as large as s  2.25 mm, the value we found for the two source points.
We may associate the length of a line source with the diameter of a circular
source. The disappearance of the interference pattern occurs when the diameter
of the circular source is twice the distance of the two source points. In Figure 4.3
we show an experimental setup to observe a fringe pattern of an extended source.
The coherence condition (Eq. (4.7)) may be applied to the extended source
as well. One has that the area s times the solid angle a/Z of the source must
be small compared to (1/2)λ. This condition must be obeyed when setting up
Young’s experiment. The source point is the illuminated hole of the ﬁrst screen
and must be so small and far away that the wave at the next two holes has a ﬁxed
phase relation. The size of the hole must be determined by the opening angle a/Z
of the experimental setup. On the other hand, a star may be very large, but if the
star is so far away that the product s times the opening angle ω (see Figure 4.2)
is small compared to λ/2, the coherence condition is met. As the result, the light
from the star is like parallel light when entering the double slit. Fringes may be
observed and the light of the “large star” is called spatially coherent.

the two point sources. Fringe patterns are observed for separations s smaller than
4.5 mm. For s · ψ  λ/2, that is, s  4.5 mm we have disappearance of fringes
for the ﬁrst time. For s larger than 4.5 mm the fringe pattern reappears.

The intensities are taken in the nominator and denominator of one fringe. For the
pattern shown in the ﬁrst graph of FileFig 4.2, one has Imax  1 and Imin  0
and obtains for the visibility, V  1. When considering the superposition of two
intensity patterns, one has to determine Imax and Imin depending on the angle
ψ. We saw that the angle ψ is small because Z is large and applied the small
angle approximation (i.e., sin θ  Y/X and sin ψ  Y ′/X). From Eqs. (4.3)
and (4.4), disregarding the diffraction factors, we have for the total intensity Itot
(i.e., the sum of Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4)),
Itot(Y)  {cos[(πa/λX)(Y)]}2 + {cos[(πa/λX)(Y −Y ′)]}2.
(4.10)
Using 2 cos2 α/2  1 + cos α, we get
Itot(Y)  1 + 1/2{cos[(2πa/λX)(Y)]} + 1/2{cos[(2πa/λX)(Y −Y ′)]},
(4.11)
and with cos α + cos β  2 cos{α + β/2} cos{α −β)/2} one has
Itot(Y)  1 + {cos[(2πa/λX)(Y ′/2)]}{cos[(2πa/λX)(Y −Y ′/2)]}.
(4.12)
The minimum and maximum values of Itot depend only on Y, since Y ′ is ﬁxed
by the angle ψ for which we want to determine the visibility. The maximum
value of {cos(2πa/λX)(Y −Y ′/2)} is 1 because that is the maximum of the
cos-function and similarly the minimum value is −1. We have therefore
Itot,max  1 + {cos[(2πa/λX)(Y ′/2)]}
Itot,min  1 −{cos[(2πa/λX)(Y ′/2)]}
(4.13)
and using the deﬁnition of Eq. (4.9) one obtains for the visibility
V  | cos(πa/λX)(Y ′)|.
(4.14)
For small values of ψ  Y ′/X  s/Z we have a maximum. The ﬁrst zero of
the visibility is for πaY ′/λX  π/2; that is, Y ′/X  s/Z  λ/2a.
In FileFig 4.3 we have plotted Eq. (4.14), using similar values to those in
FileFig 4.1. We observe that the visibility is ﬁrst zero for s  2.25 mm, the
value we determined in FileFig 4.1 for the ﬁrst disappearance of the fringes.
For larger values of s we found reappearance of fringes (see the fourth graph of
FileFig 4.1).
The interval from s  0 to the value of s for which the visibility is ﬁrst zero
is called the coherence interval.

Visibility for an Extended Source (Line Source)

one has

{cos[(πa/λ)(Y/X −Y ′′/X)]}2d(Y ′′/X).
(4.16)
First one has to go through the steps of Eqs. (4.10) to (4.12) and determine the
maxima and minima. The second step is the integration of Eq. (4.14) and the
result is
V  |{sin(πa/λX)(Y ′)}/(πa/λX)(Y ′)|,
(4.17)
where Y ′/X  s/Z. The ﬁrst minimum of the visibility is obtained at
(πa/λX)Y ′  π, (that is for Y ′/X  λ/a). This is twice the value we found for
the two point sources at distance s. In FileFig 4.4 we have plotted, for similar
values to those used in FileFig 4.2, Eq. (4.17) as a function of the length s of the
extended source. One ﬁnds the ﬁrst disappearance of the fringes at s  4.5, the
same value determined in FileFig 4.2.

Michelson Stellar Interferometer
In the discussion of the intensity pattern produced by Young’s experiment for
the two source points and the extended source, we assumed a ﬁxed separation a
of the two openings. We studied the change in the intensity pattern depending on
the separation s of the source points and the diameter s of the extended source.
Michelson was interested in the measurement of the diameter of a star. In the
Young’s experiment we discussed above, the separation a of the two slits was
ﬁxed and the distance between the two source points s was varied. Application
of this experiment to the measurement of the diameter of a star is very difﬁcult
because both parameters s and a are ﬁxed. Michelson wanted to modify Young’s
experiment by making the separation a variable. However, since the diameter
he wanted to measure was so small, the setup of Young’s experiment had to be
modiﬁed.
We start with Young’s experiment for two source points. The fringe pattern of
the superposition of the two patterns on the observation screen depends on the
distance of the two source points. This is shown in Fig. 4.4a. The intensities of
the two source points are for small angles
uI  A2{cos(πaθ/λ)}2
(4.18)
uII  A2{cos(πa(θ −φ)/λ)}2.
(4.19)
The angle φ is what we wish to determine. In the setup of Figure 4.4a the
displacement of the intensity pattern of source I with respect to source II is
limited by the size of the distance a between the two slits. The modiﬁcation is
shown in Figure 4.4b. A new parameter h of the large distance between the ﬁrst
two mirrors is introduced. Changing the length h produces a change of the fringe
pattern. From the variation of the fringes for two values of h one can determine
the angle φ. In Figure 4.4b we show the modiﬁed setup and the two intensity
patterns are now given as
uI  A2{cos(πaθ/λ)}2
(4.20)
uII  A2{cos[π(aθ −hφ)/λ]}2.
(4.21)
The superposition uI + uII will show maxima and minima depending on h for
ﬁxed φ and a. We may calculate the angle φ from the observed h values for a
resulting maximum and the following minimum. For a resulting maximum we

(4.23)
The difference for h2 −h1  λ/2φ and φ is obtained since h2 −h1 can be mea-
sured. This type of modiﬁed interferometer was applied to measure the angular
diameter of Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation. At the Mt. Wilson observatory
an interferometer was used with a distance h of the two mirrors of 302 cm (121
in.). The angle was determined to be 22.6 × 10−8 rad. The distance to the star
was known from parallax measurement and the diameter was determined to be
about 300 times that of the sun. A simulation with a numerical example is given
in FileFig 4.5. The graph shows a plot of the interference pattern for assumed
values of h and φ. We determine the two values of h for observance and disap-

the interferometer a  0.5. For the simulation we have to use a value for the
angle we actually want to determine and choose φ  0.00005. We then can
determine the h values of the minima and maxima and they must satisfy the
relation h2 −h1  λ/2φ.

and show that the fringe pattern changes for the two values of h we determine.

Wavetrains and Quasimonochromatic Light
We have studied in Chapter 2 the superposition of monochromatic waves and
their amplitude and intensity pattern. In this section we examine ﬁnite wave-
trains and their superposition. Monochromatic waves are inﬁnitely long. The
sum of a number of monochromatic waves with wavelengths in a certain wave-
length interval results in a periodic wave. However, when integrating over the
wavelength interval, one obtains a ﬁnite wavetrain, (see Figure 4.5). The wave-
train appears with decreasing amplitude for large distances. The length of the
wavetrain @x  lc is proportional 1/@ν, where @ν is the frequency interval
corresponding to the wavelength interval @λ of the wavetrain. The average wave-
length of the wavetrain is called λm. The reciprocity of @x and @ν comes from
Fourier transformation theory. The “window” in the space domain is lc and @ν is
the “window” in the frequency domain. The product @x and @ν is a constant and
appears in modiﬁed form in quantum mechanics as the “uncertainty relation.”
Wavetrains which satisfy the condition
@λ/λm ≪1
(4.24)
are called quasimonochromatic light.
To get an idea of how the waveform appears for quasimonochromatic light,
we show in the ﬁrst graph of FileFig 4.6 the superposition of four waves having
wavelength λ  1.85, 1.95, 2.05, and 2.15 for medium wavelength λm  2.
In the second graph we show the waveform for the integration over the same
wavelength interval.

wavelength interval constant. Compare with the integration case.
4.2.2
Superposition of Wavetrains
In Chapter 2 we studied interference fringes produced by monochromatic light.
For the magnitude of the superposition of two monochromatic waves with optical
path difference δ, we have used cos(πδ/λ).
Interference fringes may be observed for quasimonochromatic light of narrow
width of wavelength @λ. In FileFig 4.7 we show the amplitude pattern of the
superposition of two wavetrains. The interval of integration is λ  1.85 to 2.15
and three optical path differences are considered, δ  0, 1
2λm, and λm.

The optical path difference of δ  0 corresponds to constructive interference for
δ  (1/2)λm to destructive interference and for δ  λm again to constructive
interference. The resulting amplitude of the case of destructive interference is
not zero, but much smaller than for constructive interference. We see that the
interference pattern decreases for larger and larger values of x. In FileFig 4.8 we
have calculated the intensity pattern, corresponding to the cases of constructive
interference, δ  0, and δ  λm, and destructive interference, δ  1

4.2.3
Length of Wavetrains
The length of ﬁnite wavetrains (see Fig. 4.5) may be determined with a Michelson
interferometer. The incident light is divided at the beam splitter into two parts
traveling to M1 and M2, respectively (see Fig. 4.6a). Each part is reﬂected by
a mirror and travels back to the beamsplitter (Fig. 4.6b). At the beam splitter,
the reﬂected part of the light from M1 and the transmitted part of the light from
M2 are superimposed and travel to the detector (Fig. 4.6c). When the mirror
in the Michelson interferometer is displaced, the light traveling to the detector
shows a superposition pattern of two wavetrains of ﬁnite length. First, the well-
known pattern of the superposition of two monochromatic waves appears. At a
certain large distance this pattern disappears. The wavetrain from one arm of the
Michelson interferometer will “miss” the other wavetrain because of the ﬁnite
length of the wavetrains (see Fig. 4.6d). As an example we may look at the
emission of light from 86Kr at 6056.16 ˚A. Since the wavetrain has a length of
about 1 m and displaces the one mirror by 1/2 meter because of reﬂection, the
interference is not observable. For this reason one calls the length of the wavetrain
the coherence length. For most atomic emission processes the coherence length
is much smaller whereas resonance in laser cavities may produce a much longer
coherence length of the order of 105 m.

APPENDIX 4.1
A4.1.1 Fourier Transform Spectrometer and Blackbody
Radiation
Blackbody radiation contains a large band of wavelengths and has a coherence
length with respect to the medium wavelength λm, of only a few wavelength’s. If
we consider a series of ﬁlters with smaller and smaller band width, the coherence
length of the light passing these ﬁlters has increasingly larger and larger values.
Michelson’s interferometer may be used for Fourier transform spectroscopy, as
discussed in Chapter 9. When using blackbody radiation, the total bandwidth of

202
4. COHERENCE
the incident light has to be limited to the interval from 0 to a highest frequency,
determined by the sampling theorem. The Fourier transform process analyzes
the light and determines the intensity of the resolution width @ν, which is equal
to 1/2 L where L is the length of the interferogram in meters. This length L may
be increased to larger values and consequently @ν is decreased. Therefore the
length of the corresponding wavetrain lc is increasing. This process comes to a
halt when the signatures of the interferogram are obscured by noise.
In comparison, the size of the coherence length of the atomic emission of
86Kr has its limitation in a time-limited emission process whereas when using
blackbody radiation in Fourier transform spectroscopy, the coherence length is
limited by the available signal-to-noise level.

INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 2, we discussed the wave theory of light, developed a model to su-
perimpose waves, and described the resulting interference pattern in terms of
intensity depending on wavelength. The model was based on the scalar wave
equation, but in addition we made reference to electromagnetic theory. We
needed to take into account that a light wave changes its wavelength when trav-
eling through a medium of refractive index n and also used Fresnel’s formulas.
Electromagnetic theory is described by Maxwell’s equations. The ﬁrst hint that
light is electromagnetic radiation came from electromagnetic experiments not
involving visible light. In the analysis of the experiment a constant appeared
which had the value of the speed of light. From relativity theory we know that
the speed c of light is a fundamental constant and the ultimate limit of speed. We
derive from Maxwell’s theory and the laws of reﬂection and refraction, as we
assumed in the chapter on geometrical optics, that light travels in straight lines.
We also may derive from Maxell’s equations what we used in the chapters on
interference and diffraction and obtained from the scalar wave equation.
In this chapter we describe light by electrical and magnetic ﬁeld vectors and
discuss the polarization of light. At each point in space there are two ﬁeld vec-
tors vibrating in the perpendicular direction: taking boundary conditions into
account we derive Fresnel’s formulas. Electromagnetic theory is the basis for
the description of all optical phenomena as long as quantum effects are not
involved.
Maxwell’s equations are a mathematical formulation of the electromagnetic
laws of Faraday, Ampere, and Gauss. Maxwell analyzed the mathematical
structure of these experiments, added some terms suggested by similarities in
appearance of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and formulated the four equations
203

5. MAXWELL’S THEORY
bearing his name. Today we write Maxwell’s equations in vector notation and
call B the magnetic ﬁeld vector. This point is well explained by Feynman in his
Lecture Notes, Volume II, pp. 32–34.
The four Maxwell’s equations may be written as
∇× E  −∂B/∂t
c2∇× B  j/ε0 + ∂E/∂t
(5.1)
∇· E  ρ/ε
∇· B  0,
where E is the electrical ﬁeld vector, B the magnetic ﬁeld vector, j the current
density vector, ρ the charge density, and ε0  8.854×10−12 F/m the permittivity
of vacuum. The mathematical form of the differential vector operator ∇and its
scalar “square” ∇2 is given in Appendix 5.1.
For light propagating in a vacuum, we have j  0 and ρ  0 and Maxwell’s
equations are reduced to
∇× E  −∂B/∂t
c2∇× B  +∂E/∂t
(5.2)
∇· E  0
∇· B  0.
From this set of equations we arrive at the wave equations for the vectors E and
B as shown in Appendix 5.1.
∂2E/∂x2 + ∂2E/∂y2 + ∂2/E/∂z2  (1/c2)∂2E/∂t2

where Eyo is the magnitude of the electrical ﬁeld, λ the wavelength, t the time,
and T the period of vibration. Equation (5.5) may be rewritten, introducing the
wave vector k  2π/λ, and the angular velocity ω  2π/T . Using exponential

space. Using k here must be distinguished from k, the unit vector in the z direction. The vector r
points from 0 to a point in space with the coordinates (x, y, z).
Introduction of Equation (5.6) into the wave equation results in
ω/k  v
(here v  c),
(5.7)
where ω/k is the phase velocity.
To extend the propagation to any direction in x, y, z space we use vector
notation. For the description of the plane waves we choose in the x, y, z space
the coordinate axes xi, yj, and zk, where i, j, k are unit vectors and a point in x,
y, z space is given as r  xi + yj + zk. (Note that k is used for the wave vector
and for the unit vector in z direction.) When solving Eq. (5.4) by “separation
of variables” one obtains for the wave vector in the direction of propagation
kn  kxi + kyj + kzk, where n is a unit vector and k  2π/λ (Figure 5.1). We
need to ﬁnd the components kx, ky, and kz for a wave moving in x, y, z space in
direction n. To do this we evaluate the dot product k(n · i), k(n · j), and k(n · k)
and obtain for kx, ky, and kz (Figure 5.1),
kx  (2π/λ) · sin φ cos θ
ky  (2π/λ) · sin φ sin θ
(5.8)
kz  (2π/λ) · cos φ.
For the special case of the Ey component moving in the x direction we have
θ  0◦and φ  90◦, and get (Chapter 2),
Ey  Eyo exp i{2πx/λ −2πt/T }.
(5.9)
For the case of Ey moving in the x-z plane, one has θ  0◦,
kn  kxi + kzk  (2π/λ)(sin φi + cos φk)
(5.10)

206
5. MAXWELL’S THEORY
and obtain
Ey  Eyo exp i{kx sin φ + kz cos φ −2πt/T }
(5.11)
For the general case of E and B propagating in three dimensions one gets
E  E0 exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt}
(5.12)
and
B  B0 exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt}.

The superposition principle is an important principle in physics. Adding n
solutions of the wave equations we may write
E(x, y, z, t) 

Ei(x, y, z, t).
(5.13)
Since the wave equation is a linear second-order differential equation and the
Ei(x, y, z, t) are solutions to it, it follows that E(x, y, z, t) is also a solution.
5.3
DIFFERENTIATION OPERATION
Inserting E and B into Maxwell’s equations, one ﬁnds, the following as a result
of differentiation with respect to time and space coordinates.
5.3.1
Differentiation “Time” ∂/∂t
One obtains for operating (∂/∂t) on the function exp i{k(nxx+nyy+nzz)−ωt}:
−iω exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt},
(5.14)
that is, multiplication by −iω of the exponential function.
5.3.2
Differentiation “Space” ∇ i∂/∂x + j∂/∂y + k∂/∂z
Differentiation with respect to x, that is, (∂/∂x) on the function exp i{k(nxx +
nyy + nzz) −ωt}, results in
iknx exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt}
(5.15)
and operating with ∇on the function exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt} one gets
ikn exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt},
(5.16)
that is, multiplication by ikn of the exponential function.

5.4. POYNTING VECTOR IN VACUUM
207
The results of differentiation under Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 may be stated as:
the differentiations of plane wave solutions of E and B with respect to time or
space coordinates are equivalent to multiplications by
Time coordinate: (∂/∂t) →−iω
Space coordinate: ∇→ikn.
Substitution of these operations into the set of Maxwell’s equations for a vacuum
results in
kn × E  iωB
(5.17a)
c2kn × B  −iωE
(5.17b)
kn · E  0
(5.17c)
kn · B  0.
(5.17d)
From Eq. (5.17a) and (5.17b) one sees that the vectors n, E, and B form a mutual
orthogonal triad. Since n points into the direction of propagation, E and B are
perpendicular to n and vibrate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of
propagation.TheﬁeldvectorsE andBarebothtransversewaves(seeEqs.(5.17c)

We have in MKS units: watts per square meter. The direction of the Poynting

and
B  jB0 cos{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt}.
In the case of vacuum one has B0  (1/c)E0 and gets
S  k(1/cµ0)E0E0 cos2{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt}.

208
5. MAXWELL’S THEORY
Since detectors cannot follow a time variation of optical frequencies, the time
average of the cos2 function must be used. The integral over one period T , divided
by T , results in 1/2 (see Chapter 2). Therefore, one has for the time average of
the Poynting vector
⟨S⟩ (1/2)(1/cµ0)E2
0.
(5.21)
One observes that the ﬂow of energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude
of the electrical ﬁeld vector. Using complex notation, one may write
S  k(1/cµ0)E0E0 exp i{k(nxx + nyy + nzz) −ωt}.
The absolute value of S is calculated from the square root of SS∗. As a result the
exponential factor is eliminated and one has
|S|  (1/cµ0)E2
0.
(5.22)
Equation (5.21) for the time average carries the factor 1/2, although that factor is
not present when taking the absolute value. However, the ﬂow of energy is still
proportional to the square of the amplitude of the electrical ﬁeld vector. Compare
the factor 1/2 with what has been discussed in Chapter 2 on complex notation
and intensities.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN AN ISOTROPIC
NONCONDUCTING MEDIUM
In the following we consider isotropic materials which do not have an optic axis.
In contrast, in Section 5.7 we discuss birefringent materials which have an optic
axis.
Aharmonicwavevibratinginthey directionandpropagatinginthex direction
may be represented as
Ey  Eyo cos(2π{x/λ −t/T }).
(5.23)
Using k  2π/λ and ω  2πν, where ν is the frequency ν  1/T , we have
for the product λν  c, and for the phase velocity ω/k  c. One may write
Eq. (5.23) as
Ey  Eyo cos(kx −ωt).
(5.24)
In an isotropic, nonconductive medium, the phase velocity ω/k is the same in
all directions and is called v. The index of refraction n is deﬁned as n  c/v.
We call the wavelength in the medium λn and have λnν  v. One may write for
the wave in the medium
Ey  Eyo cos(2πx/λn −ωt).
(5.25)

5.6. FRESNEL’S FORMULAS
209
Since the frequency is the same in vacuum or in the medium, one has ν  c/λn 
v/λn, or the wavelength in the medium λn  λ(v/c)  λ/n. Therefore we may
also write
Ey  Eyo cos(2πxn/λ −ωt).
(5.26)
As the refractive index n is always larger than one, the wavelength λ in vacuum
is reduced to λm  λ/n in the medium. (Also see “optical path difference” in
Chapters 2 and 3.) For harmonic waves, the proportionality of B and E changes
from Eq. (5.18) for a vacuum to
|B|  (1/v)|E|  (n/c)|E|.
(5.27)
Consequently the Poynting vector S has for this case the average value
⟨S⟩ (1/2)(n/cµ0)E2
0
(5.28)
and the absolute value is
|S|  (n/cµ0)E2
0.

Electrical Field Vectors in the Plane of Incidence
(Parallel Case)
We consider an interface in the X–Z plane of two nonconducting isotropic media
with refractive indices n1 and n2. A wave is incident on the interface and we
assume that its electrical ﬁeld vector E vibrates in the plane of incidence,
E∥ E∥o exp i(k(n · r) −ωt),
(5.30)
and its magnetic ﬁeld vector is perpendicular to the plane of incidence,
B⊥ B⊥o exp i(k(n · r) −ωt).
(5.31)
The propagation vector kn is in the plane of incidence and in our coordinate
system, B⊥is in the Z direction. The sign is determined with the right-hand rule
for the triad of n, E, and B. To determine the analytical expression of the exponent
in Eqs. (5.30) and (5.31), the unit vectors ni, nr, and nt, pointing in the direction
of propagation of the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted light (Figure 5.2), are
calculated as
ni  (ni · i) i + (ni · j) j
(5.32)
nr  (nr · i) i + (nr · j) j
(5.33)
nt  (nt · i) i + (nt · j) j

and for the dot products one gets
(ni · i)  sin θi
(nr · i)  sin θr
(nt · i)  sin θt
(5.35)
(ni · j)  −cos θi
(nr · j)  cos θr
(nt · j)  −cos θt.
(5.36)
The incident wave, using ni(Xi + Yj) may be written as
Ei  Eio exp i[k1(sin θii −cos θij) · (Xi + Yj) −ωt].
(5.37)
After calculating the dot products and proceeding similarly for the reﬂected and
transmitted components of the electrical ﬁeld Er and Et, we list all components
as
Ei  Eio exp i{k1(sin θiX −cos θiY) −ωt}
incident
(5.38)
Er  Ero exp i{k1(sin θrX + cos θrY) −ωt}
reﬂected
(5.39)
Et  Eto exp i{k2(sin θtX −cos θtY) −ωt}
transmitted,(5.40)
where k1  2πn1/λ and k2  2πn2/λ. The refractive index n1 is the refractive
index of the medium of the incident and reﬂected waves, and n2 the refractive
index of the medium of the transmitted wave. Note that both are refraction indices
and not components of the vector n.
The boundary condition of electromagnetic theory for a dielectric interface
requires that the tangential component of the ﬁeld vectorsE and B are continuous.
We have to take the amplitudes of the incident and reﬂected wave and set it equal

5.6. FRESNEL’S FORMULAS
211
to the amplitude of the transmitted wave. (This should not be confused with
energy conservation, which is when the intensity of the incident wave is equal to
the intensity of the reﬂected plus transmitted wave.) The ﬁeld components Ei,
Er, and Et are not parallel to the X-axis and their directions have been chosen
similar to those by Born and Wolf (II Ed. 1964, p.38–41). To apply the boundary
conditions, one has to use the projections on the X-axis (see Figure 5.2), and has
for Y  0, using Eqs. (5.38) to (5.40),
cos θiEio exp i[k1(sin θiX) −ωt] −cos θrEro exp i[k1(sin θrX) −ωt]
 cos θtEto exp i[k2(sin θtX) −ωt].
(5.41)
This has to be true for all times; that is,
k1 sin θi  k1 sin θr  k2 sin θt.
(5.42)
As a result one has the law of reﬂection,
θi  θr,
(5.43)
and with k1  2πn1/λ and k2  2πn2/λ, the law of refraction,
n1 sin θi  n2 sin θt.
(5.44)
We have also to consider
cos θiEio −cos θrEro  cos θtEto.
(5.45)
Since Eor and Eot are unknowns, we need a second equation to determine their
values. This can be obtained from the applications of the boundary conditions
to the magnetic ﬁeld vectors B⊥. The three vectors perpendicular to the plane
of incidence Bi, Br, Bt, which correspond to Ei, Er, and Et, all point in the Z
direction (Figure 5.2). The phase of the three B vectors is the same as it was for
the three E vectors. The application of the boundary condition results in
Bi + Br  Bt
(5.46)
From Eq. (5.27), one has B  (1/v)E. For a medium with refractive index
v  c/n one has B  (n/c)E. Insertion into Eq. (5.46) results in
n1Eio + n1Ero  n2Eto.
(5.47)
Dividing Eqs. (5.45) and (5.47) by Eio, which normalizes by the magnitude of
the incident wave, and calling the reﬂected amplitude r∥ Ero/Eio, and the
transmitted amplitude t∥ Eto/Eio, one has two equations for r∥and t∥:
cos θrr∥+ cos θtt∥ + cos θi
(5.48)
and
n1r∥−n2t∥ −n1.

Renaming θ, both the angle of incidence θi and the angle of reﬂection θr, and
calling the angle of refraction θt  θ′′, we solve Eqs. (5.48) and (5.49) for r∥
and t∥(FileFig 5.1):
r∥ (n2 cos θ −n1 cos θ′′)/(n2 cos θ + n1 cos θ′′)
(5.50)

(5.51)
These are Fresnel’s formulas for the case where the E vector of the incident light
is in the plane of incident, called the parallel case, the TE-case, or p-polarization.
5.6.2
Electrical Field Vector Perpendicular to the Plane of
Incidence (Perpendicular Case)
In Figure 5.3, we show Ei, Er, and Et pointing out of the plane of incidence,
parallel to the Z-axis. The corresponding magnetic ﬁeld vectors Bi, Br, and Bt are
also indicated. They are in the plane of incidence and need to be projected onto
the X-axes. Similar to the discussion above, after application of the boundary
conditions, we have for the magnetic ﬁeld vectors,
−cos θiBio + cos θrBro  −cos θtBto,
(5.52)
or, rewritten using the electrical ﬁeld vector,
−n1 cos θiEio + n1 cos θrEro  −n2 cos θtEto.
(5.53)
A second relation is obtained for the electrical ﬁeld vectors
Eio + Ero  Eto.
(5.54)

5.6. FRESNEL’S FORMULAS
213
We divide Eqs. (5.53) and (5.54) by Eio and call Ero/Eio the reﬂected ampli-
tude r⊥, and Eto/Eio the transmitted amplitude t⊥. After rearranging the two
equations for r⊥and t⊥we have
n1 cos θrr⊥+ n2 cos θtt⊥ +n1 cos θi
(5.55)
r⊥−t⊥ −1.
(5.56)
After solving for r⊥and r⊥one obtains
r⊥ (n1 cos θ −n2 cos θ′′)/(n1 cos θ + n2 cos θ′′)
(5.57)
t⊥ (2n1 cos θ)/(n1 cos θ + n2 cos θ′′).
(5.58)
These are Fresnel’s formulas for the case where the E vector of the incident
light is pointing out of the plane of incidence, called the perpendicular case, the
TM-case, or s-polarization.

Light Incident on a Denser Medium, n1 < n2, and the
Brewster Angle
5.6.4.1
Phase Shifts
We mentioned in Section 6.1 that we have chosen the sign of the reﬂected electri-
cal vectors at the boundary in the same way as done by Born and Wolf (1964). At
normal incidence, this sign convention results in a negative sign for the reﬂection
coefﬁcient of the p-case. For the s-case there is a positive sign. Since there is no
distinction between the p-case and s-cases for normal incidence, how can this
be explained?
A light wave reﬂected at a denser medium picks up a phase shift of π, and
we may write for the reﬂection coefﬁcients: absolute value times the complex
phase factor; that is, for the p- and s-cases, rp  |rp|eiφp and rs  |rs|eiφs,
respectively. In the book by Born and Wolf (1964) the phase factor for the p-
case is included in rp; that is, for normal incidence φp  π, eiφp  −1, and rp
is −|rp|. In the s-case the phase factor is not included; that is φs  0, eiφs  1,
and rs is |rs|. Graphs of |rp|, |rs|, φp, and φs are shown in FileFig 5.2 for light
incident from a less dense medium to a more dense medium. Note that φp is the
argument of rp, and φs of rs.
5.6.4.2
Brewster’s Angle
In FileFig 5.2 one observes from graphs of rp and rs, depending on the angle of
incidence θ, that for a speciﬁc angle, called the Brewster angle, rp is zero and
rs is not. From Eq. (5.59) we have for the Brewster angle
(n2 cos θB −n1

1 −[(n1/n2) sin θB]2)  0.
(5.63)
We abbreviate a  n2/n1 and square Eq. (5.63):
a2 cos2 θB −n1  1 −(sin2 θB/a2)  cos2 θB + sin2 θB −(sin2 θB/a2)
(5.64)
or
(a2 −1) cos2 θB  (1 −a−2)(sin2 θB)  [(a2 −1)/a2] sin2 θB.
Since a2 > 1 we can cancel (a2 −1) and obtain
tan θB  n2/n1.
(5.65)
This is the tangent of the Brewster angle.

At the Brewster angle, one sees that the phase angle changes for the parallel case
from 0 to 180 degrees. For the perpendicular case there is no Brewster angle and
no change. The transmission coefﬁcients are not undergoing any phase shifts.

Critical Angle and Phase Shifts
At a larger angle than the Brewster angle, called the critical angle θc, the curves
for the absolute value of rp and rs approach 1, while the transmission coefﬁcients
decrease to 0. All arguments of rp and rs, and tp and ts decrease after the critical
angle. We apply the law of refraction to this case and ﬁnd that the refraction
angle becomes imaginary when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle
given by
sin θc  n2/n1,
(5.66)
where n1 is the medium with the larger index of refraction, from which the light
is incident on the interface. The question of real and imaginary refraction angles
is studied in FileFig 5.4.

In contrast to what was done in the application of the boundary conditions, we
now calculate the energy ﬂow. At the boundary, we equated the sum of the ﬁelds
of incident and reﬂected amplitude on one side with the transmitted amplitude
on the other side. Now we want to ﬁnd out how much of the incident energy is

n1 > n2, Critical Angle and Total Reﬂection

becomenegativewhenθ isbeyondthecriticalangle.Wemayrewritetheformulas
by taking out of the square root the factor
√
−1  i and have all reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients be complex functions. Let us look, as an example, at
the perpendicular case where we have for r,
rs  cos θ −(n2/n1)i

[(n1/n2) sin θ]2 −1)
cos θ + (n2/n1)i

(5.77)
The complex conjugate is

To get the reﬂectance R, one has to take rr∗, where r∗is the complex conjugate of
r and R  r⊥r∗

Total Reﬂection and Evanescent Wave
We look at the transmitted amplitude for the case where the angle of incidence
is larger than the critical angle. We have
Et  Eto exp i{k2(sin θtX −cos θtY)} exp(−iωt),
(5.79)
where Eto may be calculated from Fresnel’s formulas. Using the law of refraction
as k1 sin θi  k2 sin θt we may rewrite Et depending on the angle of incidence:

POLARIZED LIGHT
5.7.1
Introduction
In contrast to solutions of the scalar wave equation the solutions of Maxwell’s
equations are vector waves. In the discussion of Fresnel’s formulas, we consid-
ered the two components of the electrical ﬁeld vector, parallel and perpendicular
to the plane of incidence. The two electrical ﬁeld vectors vibrate in directions per-
pendicular to each other and each vector presents linear polarized light.Linearly
polarized light may be produced by reﬂection under the Brewster angle at the
surface of a dielectric material or when light is reﬂected on wire gratings with a
wavelength larger than the periodicity constant.
The superposition of two linear polarized light vectors will result in linearly
polarizedlight,butonlyifthereisnophasedifferencebetweenthetwovibrations.
A phase difference may be produced by using total internal reﬂection and will
result in elliptically or circularly polarized light. The incident light is reﬂected at a
denser medium and the two components, the p-component and the s-component,
have a ﬁxed phase angle between them, which is assumed to be zero. After
reﬂection, each of the two reﬂected components “picks up” a different phase
angle and the superposition results in a phase angle between the two components.
There are dielectric materials with different refractive indices in different
directions of the material. Plastic ﬁlms, produced by stretching, may transmit

5.7. POLARIZED LIGHT

partially polarized light. Some of the large molecules of the material are oriented
in the direction of the stress, and the refractive index is different in the parallel
and perpendicular directions.
Uniaxial crystals have different orientations of molecules with respect to the
axis and in perpendicular layers; see below.
5.7.2
Ordinary and Extraordinary Indices of Refraction
Optical materials may have a different refractive index in one direction than in
another direction. These materials are called birefringent. Examples are quartz
and calcite, both uniaxial crystals. These crystals are composed of layers of
atoms, which are arranged in planes, and the planes are stacked in a pile. The
atoms are symmetrically positioned in each plane and the normal of the planes
is the symmetry axis (Figure 5.5). We use an X, Y, Z coordinate system. The
symmetry axis is Z and the X and Y axes are in the plane and perpendicular to
each other.
The refractive index along the Z-axis is different from the index along the
X- and Y-axes. The refractive index along the Z-axis is called the extraordinary
index ne and along the X and Y-axes ordinary index n0.
FIGURE 5.5
Propagation with respect to the optic axis (Z), shown by black arrows: (a) wave
propagating parallel to the Z-axis. Possible directions of the oscillating electric ﬁelds are along
the X- and Y-axes; (b) wave propagating perpendicular to the Z-axis, for example in the direction
of the X-axis. Possible directions of the oscillating electric ﬁelds are along the Y- and Z- axes.

230
5. MAXWELL’S THEORY
For quartz we have ne  1.553 and n0  1.544 (positive crystal);
For calcite we have ne  1.486 and n0  1.658 (negative crystal).
The velocity of light in the medium is calculated from v  c/n. For quartz the
velocity along the Z-axis is smaller than along the X- and Y-axes and Z is called
the slow axis. Crystals where the optical axis is the slow axis are called positive
crystals. For calcite the velocity along the Z-axis is faster than along the X- and
Y-axes and Z is called the fast axis. Crystals where the optical axis is the fast
axis are called negative crystals.
5.7.3
Phase Difference Between Waves Moving in the
Direction of or Perpendicular to the Optical Axis
The refractive index is related to the polarization of the atoms in the direction of
the oscillating E-vector. As a result, the velocity of propagation is determined
by the direction of vibration of the E-vector that is perpendicular to the direction
of propagation. In Figure 5.6a we show waves propagating in the Z direction,
but vibrating in the X and Y directions, which are in the plane of the layers
perpendicular to the Z direction. The ordinary index determines the velocity of
propagation, which is the same for both. In Figure 5.6b we show two waves
propagating in the X direction, but one oscillates in the Y direction and the
other in the Z direction. The velocity of the wave vibrating in the Y direction is
determined by the ordinary index n0, whereas the velocity of the wave vibrating
in the Z direction is determined by the extraordinary index ne. These two waves
propagate with different velocities in the X direction and therefore will develop
a phase difference.

(5.84)
EZ  kAei(k1X−ωt),
(5.85)
taking equal amplitudes of the electrical ﬁeld vectors.
Assuming that the material has a refractive index n1 for the wave vibrating
in the Y direction and index n2 for the wave vibrating in the Z direction with
corresponding wave vectors k1 and k2, we write
EY  jAei(k1X−ωt)
(5.86)
EZ  kAei(k2X−ωt).

In Figure 5.8 we show an example of two waves with a phase difference of φ.

Half-Wave Plate, Phase Shift of π
We consider the case where φx  π and have from Eq. (5.88) for the corre-
sponding distance X  π/(k2 −k1). At this distance there is a phase difference
of π between the EY and the EZ components, compared to the EY and the EZ
components at X  0 (Figure 5.9). We apply this to the case of quartz using ne for
the Z component and n0 for the Y component and k1  2πn0/λ, k2  2πne/λ
and have
X  π/(2πne/λ −2πn0/λ)  (λ/2)/(ne −n0).

This distance X is very small, but any odd integer of X will have the same effect.
Therefore one may use a plate of thickness
Lh  (λ/2)(1 + 2m)/(ne −n0),
(5.92)
where m is an integer. Since ne is larger than n0 we have a positive value for d,
and therefore quartz has been marked above as a positive crystal.
The case of calcite is reversed. We have ne smaller than n0 so d is a negative
value. Consequently calcite is called a negative crystal.
In FileFigs.8 we ﬁrst look at the plane X  0. In the ﬁrst graph the Y and
Z components are plotted as functions of X and in the second graph the Z
component is plotted against the Y component. The third and fourth graphs
show what happens in the plane X  Lh, after a phase shift of π. In the third
graph the Y and Z components are plotted as functions of X and the phase
change of the Z component is shown. In the fourth graph the Z component is
plotted against the Y component. The direction of the resulting vibration of the
two waves is shifted by 90◦from the second to the fourth graph (and not by π

We now consider the case where φX  π/2 and have the distance X 
(π/2)/(k2 −k1). There is a phase difference of π/2 between the EY and EZ
components at this distance, compared to the EY and EZ components at X  0
(Figure 5.10). We apply this to the case of quartz using ne for the Z component,

X  (π/2)/(2πne/λ −2πn0/λ)  (λ/4)/(ne −n0).

We may write Eqs. (5.99) and (5.100), for a certain time interval, as EY 
cos(−2πx1/360) and EZ  cos(−2πx1/360 + π/2). The time interval corre-
sponds to a certain distance in the direction of propagation and to a certain angle
interval x1/360. In FileFig 5.9 we show four graphs, corresponding to intervals
of angles from 1◦to 90◦, 1◦to 160◦, 1◦to 235◦, and 1◦to 315◦. Looking onto the
paper, in the direction of the source, we see that the resulting vibration describes
a circle. The circle develops for positive φX  +π/2 in a counterclockwise di-
rection and the light is called left polarized. Considering EY  cos(−2πx1/360)
and EZ  cos(−2πx1/360−π/2), for negative φX  −π/2, the circle develops
in the clockwise direction and the light is called right polarized.

Crossed Polarizers
The experimental setup of crossed polarizers is a sequence of a horizontal (X
direction) and a vertical (Y direction) polarizer. Any light passin the ﬁrst polar-
izer will not pass the second. Therefore no light passes the crossed polarizers
conﬁguration.
5.7.6.1
Half Wave Plate Between Crossed Polarizers
We next discuss the case where a half-wave plate is placed between the polarizer
and analyzer of the crossed polarizers conﬁguration. We assume that the half
wave plate is oriented with its optical axis (Z) at 45◦degrees to the horizontal
direction of the polarizer (Figure 5.11). The incident light is ﬁrst horizontally
polarized by the polarizer and then incident on the half wave plate. The horizontal
polarized light is split up in a Z component along the axis of the half-wave plate

and a Y component perpendicular to it. The Z component leaves the plate with a
phase shift of π, oscillating in the Z direction, while the Y component remains
oscillating in the Y direction. The resultant of the two components leaving the
half-wave plate is polarized in the vertical direction, and will pass the vertical
polarizer. In this setup all the light passing the horizontal polarizer will also pass

Quarter-Wave Plate Between Crossed Polarizers
A quarter-wave plate is placed between crossed polarizers with its axis at 45◦
(Figure 5.12). The light passing the ﬁrst polarizer, incident on the quarter-wave
plate, is decomposed into two components. One oscillates parallel and the other
perpendicular to the axis of the quarter wave plate. The resultant, leaving the
quarter-wave plate, is not stationary. It rotates around the direction of propagation
X and light passes the second polarizer, also called the analyzer. Rotation of the
quarter wave plate around a range of angles will not affect this. However, the
axis of the quarter-wave plate should not be parallel to the linear polarizers.

General Phase Shift
5.7.7.1
Half- and Quarter-Wave Plates
We have discussed the generation of phase differences of π and π/2 by a half-
wave plate and a quarter-wave plate. Another way to produce a phase difference
between the two components of the electrical ﬁeld vector is by internal total
reﬂection. In the case of n1 > n2, we have complex reﬂection coefﬁcients in the
region of total reﬂection. The range of the phase shifts is between plus or minus
π, different for the p- and s-cases. We also have a change in the magnitude of
reﬂection. If we superimpose the vectors of the total internal reﬂected light for
the p- and s-cases, we would, in general, obtain elliptical polarized light.
5.7.7.2
Linear, Circular, and Elliptical Polarized Light
We now examine elliptically polarized light. We consider the plane X  L and
the corresponding phase difference of φX, for angles between 0 and 360◦. We
refer to Eqs. (5.89) and (5.90):
EY  jA exp i(k1L −ωt)
(5.89)
EZ  kA exp i(k1L −ωt + φX).
(5.90)
By only using the real part of the Y and Z components and substituting α 
(k1L −ωt), we have
EY  A cos α
(5.101)
EZ  A cos(α + φ)  A[cos α cos φ −sin α sin φ].

One sees that the two components of linearly polarized light, vibrating along
perpendiculardirections,resultinlinearpolarizedlightwhenthephasedifference
is φX  0, π, and 2π. The resulting vibration takes place along a line tilted by
45◦for φX  0, 2π, and tilted by 135◦for φX  π. For φX  π/2 we have left
circular polarized light and for φX  3π/2, equivalent to −π/2, right circular
polarized light. The ellipse is left turning, when the φX values are ﬁrst larger and
then smaller than φX  π/2, and “right turning” for φX values ﬁrst larger and
then smaller than φX  3π/2. The large axis of the ellipse is always oriented in
the same direction as the axis of the “closest” linear polarized light.

Phase Difference Between Internally Reﬂected
Components
We have mentioned above that elliptically polarized light may be produced by
total internal reﬂection. The incident light is reﬂected at a denser medium and
the two components, the p and s components, have a ﬁxed phase angle between
them which is assumed to be zero. The reﬂected light is the superposition of
the two reﬂected components, each “picking up” a different phase angle upon
reﬂection. The difference between the two “new” phase angles after reﬂection
is the phase angle between the two components and may be calculated as
tan @/2  (sin θ)2/[cos θ

((sin θ)2 −(n2/n1)2)].
(A5.6)
We can get a graph of the angle @ from the complex reﬂection coefﬁcients rp
and rs. We just have to take the argument of rp/rs. This is done in FileFigA3.

6.1
INTRODUCTION
In the chapter on interference we discussed the resonance mode of a Fabry–
Perot. We found that all light was transmitted for a speciﬁc wavelength λ and
separation D of the Fabry–Perot plates. The condition for generation of the modes
was D  mλ/2, where m was an integer.
The modes may be considered as a standing wave. A standing wave can be
described by the superposition of two traveling waves moving in opposite di-
rections. The standing waves are characterized by m + 1 nonmoving nodes,
including both nodes on the Fabry–Perot plates. Between the nodes, the ampli-
tudes oscillate from maximum to minimum. A rectangular box of dimensions a,
b, c with reﬂecting walls (Figure 6.1) has three pairs of parallel plates in the x,
y, and z directions. Each pair may be considered as a Fabry–Perot. The walls
are assumed to be perfectly reﬂecting, and the boundary conditions for the mode
formation are required to have nodes at the walls. Using plane wave solutions,
the modes are represented by sine functions. For the x direction, we have at
length a of the box that sin(2πa/λx)  0 or 2πa/λx  π. A similar result is
found for the y and z directions and we have three standing wave conditions
a  n1λx/2,
b  n2λy/2,
c  n3λz/2.
(6.1)
Since the nis are integers, and a, b, c are constants, the possible values of the
wavelengths are restricted. Using wave vectors, Eqs. (6.1) may be written as
kx  πn1/a
ky  πn2/b
kz  πn3/c.
(6.2)
These are the wave vectors for the three components of a general mode of the
box. The corresponding wave vector is obtained by vector addition of the three

components of Eq. (6.2). For the square of the scalar value one gets
k2  π2{(n1/a)2 + (n2/b)2 + (n3/c)2}.
(6.3)
The corresponding wave is a product of three standing waves in the three direc-
tions x, y, and z. The standing waves have ﬁxed nodes, and the number of nodes
is related to the values of ni as (1 + ni) for i  1, 2, 3. Therefore, the number of
nodes may be used for the characterization of the modes. In FileFig 6.1 the ﬁrst
two graphs show the one-dimension standing waves for the x and y directions
for the case of nx  2 and ny  2. The third and fourth graphs are the contour,
and surface plots of the amplitude for Mi,k with i  2 and k  2 and the ﬁfth
and sixth graph, show the intensity. In the third through sixth graphs we see six
node lines.

STRATIFIED MEDIA
In the chapter on geometrical optics we discussed image formation with spherical
mirrors. We also discussed astronomical telescopes composed of an objective
lens and magniﬁers. Lenses always reﬂect some of the incident light, according
to Fresnel’s formulas. To reduce the reﬂection, an antireﬂection coating was
developed. A thin ﬁlm of a speciﬁc material was vacuum-deposited on the lens
surface, preventing most of the incident light of a speciﬁc wavelength from being
reﬂected. In the same chapter we also discussed laser cavities. The mirrors of a
laser cavity need to have high reﬂectivity only for a limited wavelength range,
but the reﬂectivity should be close to one in order to obtain a high gain.
In this section we show that stacks of dielectric layers may have very high
reﬂectance or transmittance. Applications are antireﬂection coatings of lenses
and mirrors for laser cavities with extremely high reﬂectivity. We study the

reﬂection and transmission of light incident on stacks of dielectric layers. All
layers have the thickness d  (1/4)(λ/n)  n/4λ, but some may have different
refractive indices from others.
6.2.1
Two Interfaces at Distance d
When calculating Fresnel’s formulas, we equated the ﬁelds on both sides of
a boundary and obtained a set of linear equations for the amplitudes of the
reﬂection and the transmission coefﬁcients. This method is called the boundary
value method and is now applied to two interfaces at distance d. In the chapter
on interference we studied the plane parallel plate and summed up all reﬂected
and transmitted waves. This method is called the summation method and is less
rigorous than the boundary value method. We consider three media and assume
normal incident light. In each medium we assume forward and backward trav-
eling waves (Figure 6.2). We do not show the time dependence of the waves,
giving us these equations for incident, reﬂected, and transmitted waves at the
two interfaces:

We take the electrical ﬁeld vector perpendicular to the plane of incidence,
which is the case of perpendicular polarization discussed in Chapter 5. We ﬁrst

250
6. MAXWELL II. MODES AND MODE PROPAGATION
take into account the electrical ﬁeld vectors at boundary 1, where Y  0. The
sum of Eqs. (6.4) and (6.5) is equal to the sum of Eqs. (6.6) and (6.7). At the
boundary for Y  d the sum of Eqs. (6.6) and (6.7) is equal to the sum of
Eqs. (6.8) and (6.9). We obtain the following equations

interfaces. In a similar manner we obtain a second set of two equations for the
B-ﬁelds. This is similar to the calculations of Fresnel’s formulas in Chapter 5,
applying the corresponding boundary conditions for the B-ﬁeld at Y  0 and
Y  d.

In order to derive a vector-matrix formulation, we abbreviate the sum of the
amplitudes before the ﬁrst boundary (Eq. (6.10)), by E1,d0. Since Eq. (6.11)
was derived using the magnetic ﬁeld vector we call the amplitude B1,d0. In a
similar way we use E2,d0 and B2,d0 for the sum of the amplitudes after the
ﬁrst boundary. For the amplitudes before and after the second boundary, we use
E2,dd and B2,dd, and E3,dd and B3,dd, respectively. We may now write

6.2.2
Plate of Thickness d  (λ/2n2)
We apply Eq. (6.22) to a plate of thickness d  (λ/2n2)q, where q is an integer.
The thickness of the plate is a multiple of half a wavelength divided by the
refractive index n2 of the material of the plate. Using k  2πn2/λ and d 
(λ/2n2)q we have for the product kd  qπ. At the boundary we have for the
exponentials e−ik′d  e−ikd. Both are 1 for even q. Equation (6.22) is now

The matrix M is the unit matrix and the result is that the medium of thickness
d has no effect on the transmitted ﬁelds. The same result is obtained when q is
odd. A similar result has been obtained in Chapter 2 for the plane parallel plate.
All incident power of the particular wavelength λ will be transmitted when the
plate has the thickness d  (λ/2n2)q.

We apply Eq. (6.22) to a plate of thickness d with refractive index n2. We also

R  xx∗for the reﬂected intensity and T  yy∗for the transmitted intensity.
Equation (6.24) is a system of two linear equations in x and y and is solved for
x and y. The result for T is
T  1/[1 + {(n2 −1)2/4n2}(sin(kd)2].
(6.25)
Here we can use T for the transmitted intensity because we have assumed that
the refractive index in the ﬁrst medium is n1  1. This is the same result one
obtains with the summation method for the case of normal incidence, discussed
in Chapter 2.

Antireﬂection Coating
Antireﬂection coating may be found on camera lenses. A thin dielectric ﬁlm
of refractive index n2 is vacuum-deposited on the surface of a lens of refractive
index n3. We assume for the ﬁlm a thickness λ/(4n2). The light is incident from a

We have the result: the antireﬂection ﬁlm of a thickness of a quarter-wavelength
must have a refractive index equal to the square root of the product of the re-
fractive index on both sides. Let us consider a glass lens of index n3  1.5. The
incident light travels in the medium with n1  1 and n3  1.5 being the index
of the lens. The square root of the product is 1.22. A material with exactly that
refractive index is hard to ﬁnd, but material with approximately that value is used
for antireﬂection coating.

Multiple Layer Filters with Alternating High and Low

GUIDED WAVES BY TOTAL INTERNAL
REFLECTION THROUGH A PLANAR WAVEGUIDE
6.3.1
Traveling Waves
When laser light was applied to telecommunication, one looked at the possi-
bilities of light traveling through some type of guide. Travel through the open
air resulted in too many losses. Long wavelength electromagnetic waves travel
through metal cables, but microwaves may travel inside a rectangular waveguide.
These waveguides have parallel reﬂecting metal surfaces, and the wavelength of
a traveling mode is characterized by the dimensions of the rectangular cross-
section. As the ﬁrst step for propagation of modes of laser light one considered a
dielectric ﬁlm of refractive index n1 with refractive indices n2 and n3 equal to 1
on the outside. Later, dielectric ﬁbers were used for guiding the light, discussed
in the next section.
In Chapter 2 we discussed the modes of a Fabry–Perot. The incident light wave
was traveling perpendicular to the planes, and a relation between the wavelength
and the distance between the planes characterized the modes. We now look at
very similar modes, formed inside a plane parallel dielectric ﬁlm but traveling
parallel to the boundaries of the plate.

256
6. MAXWELL II. MODES AND MODE PROPAGATION
FIGURE 6.3
Thin ﬁlm of refractive index n1 larger than the indices n2 and n3 of the outside media.
Propagation is in the X direction and mode formation in the Y direction. There are exponential
decreasing solutions in the outside medial of indices n2 and n3.
We consider three layers of dielectric materials extending in the X to Z direc-
tion and stacked up in the Y direction. We assume that the layer in the middle has
thickness d and refractive index n1. Above and below are two other dielectric
materials with refractive indices n2 and n3, both smaller than n1 (Figure 6.3). A
wave in the layer with refractive index n1 is totally reﬂected on the two interfaces,
above and below, and travels effectively in the X direction.
When treating the plane parallel plate (see Chapter 2) we summed up all
the light reﬂected and transmitted at the different interfaces and found resonance
conditions corresponding to modes. Summing up all the reﬂected and transmitted
light is called the summation method in contrast to the boundary value method,
used in Section 6.2 to describe the modes for multilayer dielectric material. To
treat the problem of waves traveling with internal total reﬂection in a dielectric
layer, we apply another method, the traveling wave method. For comparison, the
boundary value method is given in the appendix.
We assume a wave is traveling in the X direction in medium (1) between the
two media 2 and 3. We assume that the angle to the normal θ is larger than the
critical angle, in order to have total reﬂection. A ray is launched from a point
inside the plate and after reﬂection on each interface, the pattern repeats. If the
component of the wave traveling in the Y direction has the same wave vector
after one period of travel in the X direction, we have a traveling mode. This is
only possible for discrete values of the angle θ, the angle corresponding to the
direction of the k vector and the normal (Figure 6.3). We use complex notation
for presenting the wave traveling between internal reﬂections in the X, Y plane
u1  ei(2πXn1/λ)ei(2πYn1/λ)e−iωt,
(6.36)
where λ is the wavelength in free space, ω the frequency, t the time, and n1
the refractive index in medium (1). Equation (6.36) is a function of X and Y

6.3. GUIDED WAVES BY TOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION THROUGH A PLANAR WAVEGUIDE
257
and satisﬁes the scalar wave equation depending on X, Y, and t. We rewrite
Eq. (6.36) using the wave vector notation
u1  ei(k1XX)ei(k1Y Y)e−iωt,
(6.37)
and have for the components of the wave vectors (k1X)2 + (k1Y)2  k2
1, with
k1  n1k and k  2π/λ.
As we know from our discussion of total internal reﬂection, there is an ex-
tension of the internally reﬂected wave into the optically denser medium, called
the evanescent wave. To describe these waves for the two media with refractive
indices n2 and n3, we write for the wave in (1), similarly to what we wrote for
the wave in medium (2),
u2  ei(k2XX)ei(k2Y Y)e−iωt,
(6.38)
with (k2X)2 + (k2Y)2  k2
2, k2  n2k, and k  2π/λ, and similarly for medium
(3)
u3  ei(k3XX)ei(k3Y Y)e−iωt
(6.39)
with (k3X)2 + (k3Y)2  k2
3, k3  n3k, and k  2π/λ.
6.3.2
Restrictive Conditions for Mode Propagation
We recall that we derived a restriction on certain parameters when discussing
the modes in the Fabry–Perot. For the traveling mode in a waveguide we have a
similar, but more complicated situation. The k vectors of the three waves have a
real value for the Y component in medium (1) and an imaginary value in media
(2) and (3) because of total reﬂection. We have for the k vectors:
1. Components of the k vector in the Y direction,
k1Y real, and ˜k2Y and ˜k3Y imaginary; and
(6.40)
2. Components of the k vector in the X direction
For the three waves traveling in the X direction, the X component of the k
vector has the same real value. We use the notation
k1X  k2X  k3X  β.
(6.41)
The value of β is restricted to k1 ≥β ≥k2 and k1 ≥β ≥k3, which follows
from the relations
k2
2 −β2  k2
2Y, but since ˜k2Y is imaginary, β must be larger than k2
k2
1 −β2  k2
1Y, but since k1Y is real, β must be smaller than k1

3 −β2  k2
3Y, but since ˜k3Y is imaginary,β must be larger than k3.

6.3.3
Phase Condition for Mode Formation
We deﬁne the phase change upon reﬂection on medium 2, (1 →2), as N1,2 and
for reﬂection on medium 3, (1 →3), as N1,3. Considering a round trip in the
Y direction, we have for the phase shift: on medium 2: (2πd/λ1)N1,2, and on
medium 3: 2πd/λ1 + N1,3. The sum must have values of 2πm which is written
2πm  2[2πd/λ1] + N1,2 + N1,3 with m  0, 1, 2, 3.
(6.42)
This is the resonance condition for the mode, involving the k values in the Y
direction. The phase values are calculated from Fresnel’s formulas depending
on the Y components of k. The resonance conditions are different for the s-
polarization (TE) modes and the p-polarization (TM) modes, and are discussed
separately in Sections 6.3.4 and 6.3.5.

(6.43)
We multiply by 2π/λ and introduce the deﬁnitions of the k vectors. Since the
values of k in media 1 and media 3 are imaginary, we write ˜k2Y and ˜k3Y and get
complex numbers for the two reﬂection coefﬁcients
˜rs1,2  (k1Y −˜k2Y)/(k1Y + ˜k2Y)

(6.46)
Ns1,3  −2 tan−1(˜k3Y/k1Y).
(6.47)
The resonance condition (Eq. (6.42)) may now be written as

(6.48)
or using the formula tan−1 A + tan−1 B  tan−1(A + B)/(1 −AB) we may
write

Modes in a Dielectric Waveguide
In Section 6.3 we discussed mode propagation in a dielectric ﬁlm of thickness of
several wavelengths and refractive index n2. The modes were guided by two outer
dielectric media of refractive indices smaller than n1. The mode propagation was
in the X direction. The media were stacked in the Y direction and extended in
the Z direction without limits. A constant refractive index was assumed.
We now consider a dielectric ﬁber of radius a and homogeneous refractive
index n1 in a surrounding medium of refractive index no (Figure 6.4). Following
in general second Jackson (1975, p.364), we choose the direction of propagation
in the z direction, but use refractive indices instead of dielectric constants. We
start with the general wave equations
∂2E/∂x2 + ∂2E/∂y2 + ∂2E/∂z2  (1/c2)∂2E/∂t2
(6.58)
∂2B/∂x2 + ∂2B/∂y2 + ∂2B/∂z2  (1/c2)∂2B/∂t2
(6.59)
and call the differentiation with respect to the variables perpendicular to the
direction of propagation the transverse Laplacian ∇t −∂2/∂z2.
Assuming periodic exponential solutions for the time dependence and the ﬁeld
in the z direction, one has the two constants (n1ω/c)2 and k2 after application of
the second derivative. The ratio ω/c is equal to k1 in the dielectric and k is the
wave vector for the wave traveling in the Z direction. For “inside” and “outside”

with β real. We use cylindrical coordinates ρ and φ, and assume that we have
no azimuthal variation, which means there is no dependence on φ. We have two
differential equations for the two transversal components Et and Bt, which have
Bessel functions as solutions

We have Jo(γρ) as solutions for Et and Bt “inside,” and Ko(βρ) for Et and
Bt “outside.” From Maxwell’s equations we obtain relations between the ﬁeld
components depending on the “transverse” coordinates ρ and φ and the com-
ponents depending on z. The relations are divided into two groups, βρ and Eφ
depending on Bz, and Bφ and Eρ depending on Ez.
These relations are for “inside”:

and

where A is a constant. Only the ﬁrst two equations of Eqs. (6.70) and (6.71)
are independent, and application of the boundary conditions at ρ  a yields the
equations:

k2, written in γ and β with both depending on k,
(J1(γ a)/(γ Jo(γ a))  −(K1(βa)/(βKo(βa)).

7.1
INTRODUCTION
At the end of the nineteenth century electromagnetic theory and thermodynamics
were well developed and there was the question of reuniﬁcation of these theories.
Blackbody radiation is the emission of electromagnetic radiation from a closed
cavity at temperature T through a small hole (Figure 7.1). It was found that the
frequency distribution of the emitted radiation was dependent upon the temper-
ature T . M. Planck formulated the famous blackbody radiation law in 1900. He
used electromagnetic theory and thermodynamics, but needed an assumption that
marked the beginning of quantum theory. Planck’s law involved a fundamental
physical constant, now called Planck’s constant. The emission of light from the
blackbody was interpreted as quantum emission of light. In the ﬁrst half of the
last century, the quantum emission of atoms and molecules was studied and in

the second half of the century the laser was developed. (“Laser” stands for light
ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation).
7.2
BLACKBODY RADIATON
7.2.1
The Rayleigh–Jeans Law
An example of blackbody radiation is a wire heated by electricity. First it gets
red and when the temperature increases it becomes white. Increasing the temper-
ature, one ﬁnds that the maximum of the frequency distribution of the emitted
electromagnetic radiation shifts to a shorter wavelength. In Figure 7.1 we show
a schematic of a blackbody. Radiation is emitted at thermal equilibrium and the
energy is drawn from the heat bath at temperature T . The ﬁrst, but insufﬁcient,
analysis of blackbody radiation was done by Rayleigh and Jeans, analyzing the
modes of a rectangular box in a heat bath (Figure 7.2). Oscillators were assumed
to be at the walls of the box, emitting and absorbing light. The modes of the
box are standing waves and in Figure 7.3 we show one standing wave in one
direction as we have in a Fabry–Perot. The number of standing waves in three
dimensionswasanalyzedandthenumberofmodesdeterminedwithrespecttothe
same energy which is the same frequency or wavelength. It was assumed that in
thermal equilibrium, each mode carried the energy kT , where k is Boltzmann’s
constant. The energy density per frequency interval du/dν was equal to the
energy dE per volume V and frequency interval dν. The energy density per
frequency interval du/dν was then calculated to be
du/dν  (1/V )dE/dν  8πkT ν2/c3.

7.2. BLACKBODY RADIATON

This was the Rayleigh–Jeans law and turned out to be valid for the long wave-
length region only. In the short wavelength region, the energy density increased
by ν2 and led to very high and unrealistic large energy densities, the so-called
“violet catastrophe.”
The graph in FileFig 7.1 shows the Rayleigh–Jeans radiation law in the visible
spectral region, where one can observe the increase of the radiation density to
shorter wavelengths.

interval.
L1RAJEANS is only on the CD.
7.2.2
Planck’s Law
The radiation law of blackbody radiation was discovered by Max Planck and is
valid in both the short and the long wavelength regions. Planck’s radiation law
agreed with the Rayleigh-Jeans law for the long wavelength region. Many years
later Einstein derived Planck’s radiation law using the concept of transition prob-
abilities. One assumes ﬁctitious oscillators to be on the walls of the blackbody
cavity. These oscillators are in contact with the heat bath at temperature T . When
radiating, they get the energy from the heat bath and transform it into radiation
energy. Einstein deﬁned the processes of induced absorption, induced emission,
and spontaneous emission for the emission and absorption of radiation by the
oscillators (Figure 7.4). The probability of a transition of induced absorption
between the levels numbered 1 and 2 is called W12 and is proportional to the
FIGURE 7.4
Schematic of induced absorption and induced and spontaneous emission.

272
7. BLACKBODY RADIATION, ATOMIC EMISSION, AND LASERS
energy density du/dν,
W12  B12du/dν.
(7.2a)
Similarly the probability of a transition of induced emission from level 2 to level
1 is called W21,
W21  B21du/dν.
(7.2b)
The probability of spontaneous emission is not proportional to du/dν and is
called
Wa21  A21.
(7.3)
B12, B21, and A21 are called the Einstein probability coefﬁcients. In thermal
equilibrium, there are as many transitions up as down, and for the “down” we
have in addition spontaneous emission. One has
N1(B12du/dν)  N2(B21du/dν + A21).
(7.4)
ThenumbersN1 andN2 aretheoccupationnumbersofthetwostatesofenergyE1
andE2.InthermalequilibriumN1 andN2 followfromtheBoltzmanndistribution
N1  N0 exp −(E1/kT ) and N2  N0 exp −(E2/kT ),
(7.5)
where N0 is a constant. In thermal equilibrium one has N2 < N1,which means
the occupation number for the lower energy states is always higher.
From Eqs. (7.4) and (7.5) one gets for the energy density per frequency interval
du/dν  A21/{B12 exp[(E2 −E1)/kT ] −B21}.
(7.6)
The constants A21, B12, and B21 are determined by considering two limiting
cases. When T →∞, one has du/dν →∞and it follows that B12  B21. We
may write for Eq. (7.6),
du/dν  A21/{B12(exp[(hν)/kT ] −1)},
(7.7)
where E2−E1  hv and h is Planck’s constant. To consider the long wavelength
region, we develop the exponential. In, the limit of long wavelengths, where
ν →0, the energy density per frequency interval (right-hand side of Eq. (7.7))
is
du/dν  A21/{B12(hν/kT )}.
(7.8)
This must be equal to the Rayleigh–Jeans Law, du/dν  8πkT ν2/c3 (see
Eq. (7.1)) and one obtains
(A21/B12)  8πhν3/c3.
(7.9)
Introduction of Eq. (7.9) into Eq. (7.7) gives us Planck’s formula for the energy
density per frequency interval
du/dν  8πhν3/c3{1/[exp(hν/kT ) −1]}.
(7.10)

Graphs of Planck’s formula, depending on wavelength and frequency, are given
in FileFigs.2 and 3, respectively.
7.2.3
Stefan–Boltzmann Law
The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the integrated energy over all wavelengths or
frequencies depending on the temperature T . Integration of Eq. (7.10) over the
frequency results in the energy density u:
u  (8/15)π5(kT )4/(hc)3.
(7.11)
This is the energy density equal to the energy per unit volume in the cavity of
the blackbody. To calculate the energy emitted from the hole of the blackbody,
we introduce the radiance LB (or brightness) of the blackbody. The power dW
leaving the blackbody is calculated by the product
dW  LBda cos θdR,
(7.12)
where da is the area from which the power is emitted, dR the solid angle into
which it travels, and R the angle between the normal of the area and the center
line of the solid angle (Figure 7.5). The radiance LB is measured by placing a
power meter before the opening of the blackbody, taking into account the area
FIGURE 7.5
(a)Poweremittedfromthesurfaceelementda traversesthevolumeelementdV  ql
in time l/c; (b) the solid angle seen from dV .

274
7. BLACKBODY RADIATION, ATOMIC EMISSION, AND LASERS
and solid angle. This can be written
dW/(da cos θdR)  LB.
(7.13)
The radiation is emitted into a hemisphere and when integrating over the solid
angle of the hemisphere we have
W  LBdaπ.
(7.14)
The radiance LB is related to the energy density u of the blackbody and we want
to ﬁnd the relation between these quantities. We consider a small volume dV  l
times q (Figure 7.5a). The power dW, transmitted in the time interval dt from
the area da of the blackbody into the solid angle dR, is then
dWdt  LBda cos dRdt.
(7.15)
Using from Figure 7.5 dR  q/r2 and dt  l/c and observing that dWdt 
dudV one obtains
dudV  (LBda cos θdV )/(r2c).
(7.16)
Integration over the area times the solid angle, seen from dV (Figure 7.5b),
results in
u  (LB/c)[∫da(cos θ/r2)]  (LB/c) ∫dRV .
(7.17)
The integral is over the surrounding sphere and is 4π. Using Eqs. (7.11) and
(7.14) one has
LB · π  2c
15π (πkT )4
(hc)3 .
(7.18)
This is the Stefan–Boltzmann law telling us that the “total emission” is
proportional to T 4. The constant σ
 (2c/15)(πk)4/(hc)3 has the value
5.670310−8W/(m2K4).
In FileFig 7.4 graphs shown of the Stefan–Boltzmann law in units of
power/area.
7.2.4
Wien’s Law
The wavelength at maximum emission of the blackbody may be calculated by
rewriting Eq. (7.10) as a function of the wavelength and setting it to zero. One
gets
λmT  2.8910−3mK.
(7.19)
This is called Wien’s displacement law.
Graphs of Wien’s displacement law are shown in FileFig 7.5.

ATOMIC EMISSION
7.3.1
Introduction
The operation of a laser needs an “active medium” between the two mirrors
of the laser cavity. Energy is “pumped” from the outside of the cavity into this
medium and produces atoms or molecules in excited states. Here we discuss only
excited energy states of atoms in the gas phase and consider the hydrogen atom
and atoms with hydrogenlike spectra. The energy states are labeled by letters
with subscripts and superscripts and some of the notations have their origin
in the “old days” of spectroscopy. At that time, for example, one used for the
characterization of some spectral lines: s for “sharp,” and d for “diffuse.” The

278
7. BLACKBODY RADIATION, ATOMIC EMISSION, AND LASERS
letters s and d are still in use for the characterization of the angular momentum.
There is some truth to these notations, since we know that the s-state has less
degeneracy than the d-state.
7.3.2
Bohr’s Model and the One Electron Atom
In Bohr’s model, an electron with a negative charge circulates around the positive
charge in the center of its orbits, determined by the principal quantum number
n. The energy of such an orbit is given by
E  (−2π2K2e4m)/(n2h2),
(7.23)
where K is the constant of Coulombs’ law, e the electron charge, m the electron
mass, and h Planck’s constant. The principal quantum number n has integer
numbers 1, 2.3 . . .. Radiation is emitted when the electron changes its orbits and
the energy of the emitted photon is given as
νni,nf h  [2π2K2e4m)/(h2)][1/n2
i −1/n2
f ],
(7.24)
where ni is the quantum number of the initial orbit and nf is the quantum num-
ber of the ﬁnal orbit. In Figure 7.6 we show the series of lines originating from
the state nf  1, called the Lyman series, from the state nf  2, called the
Balmer series, and from the state nf  3, called the Paschen series. The signif-
icant achievement of Bohr’s derivation was that he used fundamental physical
constants and could reproduce exactly the empirical constant of the expression
of the Balmer series.

energy states is shown in Figure 7.7. For such an atom, we have energy levels
labeled by the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum
number l. The Schroedinger equation tells us that for each n there are n −1
different possible states of the angular momentum.
7.3.3.2
Magnetic Quantum Number and Degeneracy
To each state labeled by the angular quantum number l, there are 2l+1 substrates.
They only have different energy values if the atom is in a magnetic ﬁeld. The
corresponding quantum number is called the magnetic quantum number m. If
the magnetic ﬁeld is zero, all states have the same energy, and therefore the state
is m fold degenerate.

Each electron has an angular momentum with respect to its own axis called the
spin, described by the spin quantum number s. In a magnetic ﬁeld, the projection
has the values 1/2 and −1/2.
7.3.3.4
Pauli Principle and Occupation Rule
Each nondegenerate state of the atom has a different set of quantum numbers n,
l, m, s. For each n there are n −1 values of l. For each l there are 2l + 1 values
of m and for each m there are two values of s (Figure 7.7).
7.3.3.5
Buildup Principle of Atoms and Labels for Energy Levels
The energy schematic of an atom with Z electrons may be obtained, in ﬁrst
approximation, by using the “buildup principle.” There are special notations for
the principal and angular quantum numbers.
The principal quantum number n  1, 2, 3 . . . is labeled K, L, M,. . . .
The angular quantum number l  0, 1, 2, 3 . . . is labeled s, p, d, f .
Following the buildup principle, the electrons ﬁrst occupy the lowest n, then the
next, and so on. For each n, electrons ﬁll all possible states labeled by l, m, and s.

In Figure 7.8 the number of electrons occupying different states is listed for
the elements from Z  1 to Z  25. There are irregularities, explained by
quantum mechanics. An example is Z  19, where the 4s state has lower energy
than the 3d state.
7.3.3.6
Transitions Between Energy States
Photons may be emitted when the atom changes from a higher energy state to a
lower one. In an atom like the sodium atom, there is just one “outer” electron.
All other electrons are in “closed” shells. This outer most electron is an “s”
electron (Figure 7.9), and therefore the spectrum has a similarity to the spectrum
of the hydrogen atom. The columns in Figure 7.9 are labeled with capital letters,
referring to compound states of all electrons. Since the K and L shells are closed,
they do not contribute and the angular momentum of all electrons is the same as
the single electron in the M shell.
There are selection rules restricting the energy levels between which transi-
tions are possible. The general rule is that the angular momentum has to change
byplusorminus1.Transitionsareonlyallowedbetweenthelevelsofthecolumns

Introduction
The atom emits light when an electron makes a transition from a higher energy
state to a lower one. The emitted light is not monochromatic, since the emission
process last only for a short time. Therefore we have a wavetrain of limited
length. Such wavetrains are described by the superposition of a large number of
monochromatic waves having a certain frequency distribution (see Chapter 4).
The frequency spectrum shows a maximum at the transition frequency and the
bandwidth of the frequency distribution is related to the time of the emission
process.

Classical Model, Lorentzian Line Shape, and
Homogeneous Broadening
Light is emitted from an atom when an electron leaves an excited state E2 and
occupies a state with lower energy E1. One has for the energy of the process
E2 −E1  hν.
(7.25)
Before the electron can make the transition, it has to be placed into the upper
state. This process is called population inversion (see Section 5.2). The electron
remains in the upper state for a limited time. On average the life-time of an
excited state is 10−8 sec. However, longer lifetimes corresponding to metastable
states play an important role in laser action. The emitted light is described by
a wavetrain with decreasing amplitude (Figure 7.10), and may be described in
ﬁrst approximation as
A  A0e−iω0te−t/τ.
(7.26)
The lifetime τ is deﬁned as the time in which the initial amplitude A0 drops to
a value of A0/e  A0/2.718. The frequency distribution of the wavetrain now

The integral may be calculated analytically and one gets

(7.28)
The intensity is obtained as
I(ω)  y(ω)y(ω)∗ 90[1/{(ω0 −ω)2 + (1/2τ)2}].
(7.29)
The constant ψ0 is the total intensity and depends on the lifetime τ. From
Eq. (7.29) one deﬁnes the proﬁle of the line or the Lorentzian line shape as
gl(ω)  2[(1/2τ)/{(ω0 −ω)2 + (1/2τ)2}].
(7.30)
A graph of gl(ω) is shown in in Figure 7.11 with ω0 at its center and a ﬁxed
value of τ. The bandwidth @ω  (ω −ω0) at half-height is obtained from
(1/2)gl(ω  ω0)  gl(ω  ω0 + @ω(/2)

and one gets
@ω  1/τ.
(7.32)
Therefore, the bandwidth is related to the lifetime of the atomic emission pro-
cess, assuming that one has a waveform as given in Eq. (7.26). Introduction of
Eq. (7.32) into Eq. (7.30) results in
gl(ω)  2[(@ω/2)/{(ω −ω0)2 + (@ω/2)2}].
(7.33)
For an oscillator the quality factor is Q  ω0/@ω. This expression is similar to
the resolving power discussed for the Fabry–Perot in Chapter 2 and the grating
in Chapter 3. In FileFig 7.6 we show an example of the band shape of Eq. (7.33),
where the lifetime is chosen to be τ  1000 in order to show a graph in the
chosen frequency region.

7.4.3
Natural Emission Line Width, Quantum Mechanical
Model
In Section 7.4.2 we saw how the width of the Lorentzian line shape depends
on the lifetime τ of the electron in the upper state. The uncertainty principle of
quantum mechanics relates the lifetime τ to the width @E of the corresponding
energy state, in which the electron is placed. The uncertainty principle may be
expressed as
@Eτ  h/2π.
(7.34)
In Figure 7.12 we indicate three possible transitions from the higher to the lower
state. One corresponds to the transition from center-to-center of the two bands,
and the others to the transition between two different energies of the bands,
corresponding to lower and higher frequencies. Quantum mechanics shows that
the center-to-center transition has a higher transition probability than the other
possible transitions. The shape of the emission line shows these differences.
The Einstein coefﬁcient of spontaneous emission A21 describes a transition
probability, and is related to the lifetime of the emission process as
A21  1/τ.

gas also move while emitting light. The frequency shift, related to their particular
velocity v, is given as
ν −ν0  ν0(v/c).
(7.36)
The distribution of the velocities depends on the temperature and follows
Maxwell’s velocity distribution law. One gets
I(ν)  Iνo exp(−Ek/kT )  Iνo exp(−mv2/2kT )
 Iνo exp{(−mc2/2kT )((ν −ν0)2/(ν0)2)},
(7.37)
where I0 is a constant, m the mass of the oscillator, c the speed of light, k the
Boltzmann constant, and T the absolute temperature. As we did in Section 7.4.2
for the Lorentzian line shape, we deﬁne the Doppler line shape as I(ν)  I0gd(ν)
and get
gd(ν)  [(

π(ln 2)(2/π@ν)] exp{−(ν −ν0)2(ln 2)/(@ν/2)2}.
(7.38)
The line shape of Eq. (7.38) has a Gaussian proﬁle which is different from the
Lorentzian, schematically shown in Figure 7.13a.
The halfwidth at half height is calculated to be

The Gaussian line shape may be looked at as the envelope of a large number
of Lorentzian line shapes. Each oscillator moves with a different velocity in a
different direction and the peak frequencies of the emitted light have a Gauss
distribution, (shown in schematically Figure 7.13b). When discussing an exam-

Introduction
We discussed blackbody radiation in Section 7.2, atomic emission in Section 7.3,
the Fabry–Perot in Chapter 2, and modes in Chapter 6. We now discuss the
following simpliﬁed model for a two-level laser. We consider a Fabry–Perot
ﬁlled with an active medium of atomic oscillators. First we need population
inversion. The oscillators will be excited into the upper state 2 by using the light
of frequency νP from the outside. We need the excited states to remain excited for
sometime, for example, 10−3sec. Then we need stimulated emission to transfer
the energy of the excited oscillators to the modes of the Fabry–Perot. To have
laser light emitted from the Fabry–Perot, one must couple out part of the light
of the modes. This is done by making one of the mirrors of the Fabry–Perot not
totally reﬂective, such as when there is a small hole in the mirror.

7.5.2
Population Inversion
7.5.2.1
Two-Level System with Stimulated and Spontaneous Transitions
When discussing the blackbody radiation law, we used for the occupation of
the different energy levels in thermal equilibrium the Boltzmann distribution
Ne−E/kT , where k is Boltzmann’s constant. This distribution law tells us that,
at temperature T , the lower states are more occupied than the higher states. For
laser action we need just the reverse, which is more electrons in a higher energy
state. This is called population inversion and is in contrast to the population of
the electrons in thermal equilibrium.
We assume that we have to deal with oscillators having just two levels, as
shown in Figure 7.14. We call the upper level E2 and the lower level E1. The
change in time of the number of photons N1 of E1 and N2 of E2, the rate
equations, is
dN1/dt  −N1B12u(ν) + N2B21u(ν) + N2A21
(7.40)
dN2/dt  +N1B12u(ν) −N2B21u(ν) −N2A21,
(7.41)
where u(ν) is the radiation density. The coefﬁcient B12 is the Einstein coefﬁ-
cient of stimulated absorption. The coefﬁcient B21 is the Einstein coefﬁcient of
stimulated emission and A21 is the coefﬁcient of spontaneous emission. We have
used these coefﬁcients when deriving Planck’s radiation law, (see Section 7.2),
and used the relation
A21/B12  8πh(ν/c)3
(7.42)
as well as B12  B21. This relation has to be slightly changed for atomic os-
cillators. We have to take into account that the atomic energy levels may be
degenerate, which means there are several energy levels having the same energy.
For example, if there is a threefold degeneracy, we have to use the weight g  3

7.5. LASERS

for the transition. Therefore we have to use
g1B12  g2B21.
(7.43)
7.5.2.2
Changes in the Upper Level Considering Stimulated Transitions
A necessary condition for laser action is population inversion which as stated
before, means there must be more photons in the upper state than in the lower
state. Using only the stimulated emission and absorption processes, we have for
the number of photons in the upperstate.
N1B12u(ν),
(7.44)
and the number in the lowerstate
N2B21u(ν).
(7.45)
The change in the number of photons in time is then
dnp/dt  N2B21u(ν) −N1B12u(ν).
(7.46)
With Eq. (7.43) we write
dnp/dt  [N2 −N1(g2/g1)]B21u(ν).
(7.47)
To have laser action one needs
N2 −N1
g2
g1
> 0
(7.48)
and one has the condition for laser action, N2/g2 > N1/g1.
7.5.3
Stimulated Emission, Spontaneous Emission, and the
Ampliﬁcation Factor
To have the condition N2/g2 > N1/g1 fulﬁlled, one has to make the stimulated
emission larger than the spontaneous emission. The stimulated emission transfers
the photons from the upper energy state E2 into the modes of the Fabry–Perot.
The bandwidth for the emission process was discussed above and we assume
that we have a Lorentzian line shape. The modes of the Fabry–Perot are much
narrower and close to delta functions (see Figure 7.15). The probability of stim-
ulated emissions per unit time is calculated by considering Eq. (7.46), written
for a number of n photons as
dn/dt  [N2 −(g2/g1)N1]B21u(ν).
(7.49)
The radiation density is u(ν)  hνn. Taking into account the line shape of
the emission process, (see Eq. (7.30)), we have to multiply the coefﬁcient of
stimulated emission B21 by u(v)gl(v), that is, B21u(ν)gl(ν), and get
du(ν)/dt  [N2 −(g2/g1)N1]hνgl(ν)B21u(ν).

The width of the modes of the cavity at frequencies ν−1, ν0, and ν1 are almost delta
functions compared to the bandwidth of the Lorentzian-shaped emission line.
We can express the change of u(ν) with respect to the time dt by considering
the length dz in which the light travels in the time dt This gives us dt  dz/c′.
Here we use the speed of light c′, modiﬁed in the medium of the laser cavity.
The change of the radiation density over the interval dz is then
du(ν)/dz  [N2 −(g2/g1)N1](hν/c′)gl(ν)B21u(ν, z).
(7.51)
Using A21  1/τ, and A21/B21  8πh(ν/c′)3, we have

7.5.4
The Fabry–Perot Cavity, Losses, and Threshold
Condition
The Fabry–Perot cavity has two plane parallel mirrors with reﬂectivities R1 and
R2, and the modes are standing waves. These standing waves may be considered
as two traveling waves, moving in opposite directions. If R1 and R2 have high
reﬂectivity, the traveling waves will pass forward and backward through the
volume ﬁlled with the oscillators in the excited state E2. By stimulated emission,

7.5. LASERS
291
energy will be picked up and the intensity of each mode will increase. This
process will come to an end when the increase in energy is set off by the losses.
Large distances between the two mirrors of the Fabry–Perot correspond to a high
order of longitudinal modes and these high-order modes correspond to a very
narrow bandwidth, schematically shown in Figure 7.15. The intensity depending
on the length z of the light traveling in the active medium of the Fabry–Perot is
related to the radiation density as I(z)  c′u(ν, z). From Eq. (7.50) and (7.51)
we have
dI(z)/dz  ε(ν)I(ν, z).
(7.54)
Integration gives us
I(z)  I(0)eε(ν)z.
(7.55)
We see the exponential increase of the light traversing the active medium; energy
is transferred to the modes of the Fabry–Perot.
In order to use some of the energy one has to couple it out of the cavity. This
may be achieved by using a mirror with a small hole for one of the two mirrors
of the Fabry–Perot. The length of one round trip is z  2L and the losses are
taken into account by the factor (α(ν)) in the exponent of Eq. (7.55). We multiply
Eq. (7.55) with the reﬂectivities R1R2 to account for the reﬂection losses of one
round trip and get
I(2z)  I(0)e[ε(ν)−α(ν)]2L(R1R2).
(7.56)
The thereshold condition is then obtained from Eq. (7.56) when
e[ε(ν)−α(ν)]2LR1R2  1
(7.57)
or [ε(ν) −α(ν)]  (1/2L)ln(1/R1R2). The threshold gain is
εT (ν)  α(ν) + (1/2L)ln(1/R1R2)
(7.58)
We rewrite Eq. (7.58) by calling σ  [N2 −N1(g2/g1)] and insert εT (ν) in
Eq. (7.53) and get
σT  [α(ν) + (1/2L)ln(1/R1R2)](8πν2τ/c
′2)(1/gl(ν)).
(7.59)
This is the famous threshold condition by Schawlow and Townes (Kneub¨uhl
and Sigrist, 1988, p.38). In FileFig 7.8 we present a calculation with numerical
values for the He–Ne laser.

Simpliﬁed Example of a Three-Level Laser
We consider an energy schematic of the oscillators shown in Figure 7.14 with an
upper state 3, a lower state 2, and the ground state 1. We have for transitions be-
tween 3 and 1 induced absorption, induced emission, and spontaneous emission,
as discussed in Section 7.5.2. The transition probabilities are called W31, W13,
and A31, respectively. A similar description holds for the transitions from 2 to
1. The transitions from 3 to 2 are now special. They are radiationless transitions
and their probability is called S32. The occupation number of the oscillators in
the states 1, 2, and 3 are called N1, N2, N3 and the total number N0 is assumed
to be a constant.
N0  N1 + N2 + N3.
(7.60)
The change in time of the number of oscillators in state 3 is
dN3/dt  W13N1 −(W31 + A31 + S32)N3
(7.61)
and in state 2
dN2/dt  W12N1 −(W21 + A21)N2 + S32N3.
(7.62)
For the steady state, the time derivatives are zero. We assume that A31 ≪W31,
which gives us for the ratio N2/N1 of the oscillators
N2/N1  {(W13S32)/(W13 + S32) + W12}/(A21 + W21).
(7.63)
From the discussion of blackbody radiation, W13  W31 and W12  W21, and
we assume that the radiationless transition probability S32 is much larger than
the transition probability W13 (the probability to empty, state 3). We then have
from Eq. (7.63)
N2/N1  {(W13 + W12)/(A21 + W12)}.
(7.64)
Using Eqs. (7.60) and (7.63) we may get after some calculations
(N2 −N1)/N0  {(W13 −A21)/(W13 + A21 + 2W12)}.
(7.65)
The threshold condition for operation is obtained when, in the steady state, there
are as many oscillators in state 1 as in state 2, N1  N2. From Eq. (7.65)
one has W13  A21. The minimum power for operation is calculated from the
condition that the power corresponding to induced absorption of level 3 is equal
to the power corresponding to the spontaneous emission of state 2. In FileFig
7.9 we calculate P  NA21hν for a process involving a metastable state and
spontaneous emission.

Paraxial Wave Equation and Beam Parameters
Laser light travels forwards and backwards between the two mirrors of a res-
onance cavity. The ﬁrst Ne–He laser used a Fabry–Perot cavity of a length of
one meter between the two plane parallel mirrors and was extremely difﬁcult to
align. Later it was found that the confocal cavity was much easier to align, and
was also very efﬁcient from the point of view of diffraction losses. In Chapter
1, we discussed several types of resonators from the perspective of geometrical
optics, and in Chapter 2 the Fabry–Perot as a resonance interferometer.
In this section we discuss the confocal cavity with radii of curvature Rm  d,
where d is the distance between the two mirrors placed at z  ±d/2. Here the
origin of the coordinate system is at z  0 in the middle between the mirrors. The
laser beam in the cavity is approximated by a wave traveling in the z direction
and having a bell-shaped proﬁle in the transversal (x, y) direction (Fig-
ure 7.16). For the mathematical presentation of these propagating modes, we
use Cartesian coordinates and rectangular mirrors. We follow H. Kogelnick and

second derivative δ2ψ/δz2 may be neglected, we further consider the paraxial
wave equation
δ2ψ/δx2 + δ2ψ/δy2 −2ikδψ/δz  0.
(7.68)
Solutions of Eq. (7.68) describe a Gaussian beam proﬁle in the transverse
direction, depending on the distance r from the axis, where r2  x2 + y2
(Figure 7.17). A solution of Eq. (7.68) is
ψ  exp{−i[P (z) + k(x2 + y2)/2q(z)]}
(7.69)
with
δq(z)/δz  1
(7.70)
and
δP (z)/δz  −i/q(z),
(7.71)
where the two functions q(z) and P (z) are not independent of each other. We
are mainly interested in the solution for q(z) and can solve for P (z) if we need
it, which is a phase factor.
We write the solution of Eq. (7.70) as
q(z)  izR + z,
(7.72)

7.6. CONFOCAL CAVITY, GAUSSIAN BEAM, AND MODES
295
where zR is a constant. We present the function q(z) as a combination of the
radius of curvature of the wavefront R(z) and the beam waist w(z)2 as
1/q(z)  1/(izR + z)  1/R(z) −iλ/(πw(z)2).
(7.73)
From Eqs. (7.72) and 7.73, after separation of real and imaginary parts, we have
w(z)2  (λ/π){zR + z2/zR}
(7.74)
and
R(z)  z + z2
R/z.
(7.75)
The function w(z)2 is the beam waist, which is the width of the beam depending
on z (Figure 7.16). R(z) is the curvature of the wavefront of the beam depending
on z (Figure 7.17).
7.6.2
Fundamental Mode in Confocal Cavity
The confocal cavity was discussed in the chapter on geometrical optics. It is a
stable cavity with radii of curvature of the mirrors equal to the length d of the
cavity. The fundamental mode of the solution of the paraxial wave equation (see
Eq. (7.68)), is the same for rectangular mirrors of a cavity for which Cartesian
coordinates are used and for circular mirrors for which cylindrical coordinates
are used.
We show that the radius of curvature of the wavefront of the Gaussian beam
in the confocal cavity matches the curvature of the mirrors at distance z  d/2
and −d/2, counting z from the middle at 0.
7.6.2.1
Beam Waist
The beam waist is indicated in Figure 7.16. Inserting Eq. (7.73), into Eq (7.69)
and taking the real part one has (exp −kr2λ/2πw(z)2). With q  kλ/2π and
setting q  1 for simplicity we get (exp −r2/w(z)2). This factor decreases in
the transversal direction and is 1 for r  0 and 1/e for r  w(z). The beam is
attenuated from its value at r  0 at the axis to 1/e at distance r from the axis.
7.6.2.2
Wavefront of Beam at Center and at Mirror
Wavefront at Center
The wavefront is plain when R(z)  ∞. If we choose this value at z  0, one
gets from Eq. (7.73)
1/q(0)  −iλ/(πw(0)2)
(7.76)
From Eq (7.74) we have for the total waist in the middle w2
0  w(0)2  (λ/π)zR.

7. BLACKBODY RADIATION, ATOMIC EMISSION, AND LASERS
Wavefront at Mirrors
For z  zR we have
R(z  zR)  2zR
and
w(z  zR)2  (λ/π)2zR  2w2
0.
(7.77)
We choose 2zR  d equal to the distance d between the two mirrors, which is
also the radius of curvature of the spherical mirrors in the confocal cavity. The
radius of curvature of the wavefront at z  d/2 matches the radius of curvature
of the mirrors.
Confocal Cavity
For the confocal cavity the radius of curvature of the wavefront, when approach-
ing the mirror, is equal to the radius of curvature of the mirror (see Figure 7.17).
The beam waist is 2w2
0 at the point z  d/2, which is twice as large as at its
minimum at z  0. In FileFig 7.10 we have plotted w(z) and R(z) over the range
z  −100 to 100, which is the distance between the mirrors equal to the length
d  2zR  200. One observes the beam waist at z  0 and one obtains for the
radius of the wavefront at z  100, that is, R(100), the value 200, corresponding
to the radius of curvature of the mirror Rm  d.
The half angle of the opening of the beam in the far ﬁeld approximation is the
angle θap of the asymptote of w(z), which passes through z  0. It is obtained
as
lim
z→∞w(z)/z  w0/zR  λ/πw0.
(7.78)
The asymptote y  zw0/zR is also indicated in FileFig 7.10.

Diffraction Losses and Fresnel Number
The diffraction losses of a mirror of diameter 2a at distance d are characterized
by the Fresnel number F. We assume parallel light incident on an obstacle of
diameter 2a and have for the diffraction angle θ  λ/2a (see Figure 7.18). The
geometrical shadow AG at distance d is 4a2π and the total area AT, enlarged by
diffraction, is 4(a + θd)2π. The Fresnel number is deﬁned as F  AG/(AT −
AG), which is
F  4a2π/{(4a2 + 8ad(λ/2a) + . . .)π −4a2π}
 4a2π/(8adλπ/2a)  a2/dλ,
(7.79)
where a term in θ2 was neglected in the denominator.

Fresnel numbers for circular plain reﬂectors and confocal reﬂectors. The confocal
cavity is about two orders of magnitude better than a Fabry–Perot cavity.
A confocal resonator has considerably fewer losses for Fresnel numbers larger
than 1 compared to Fabry–Perot resonators. For example, at F  1 the confocal
resonator does more than 300 times better than the Fabry–Perot (Figure 7.19).
7.6.4
Higher Modes in the Confocal Cavity
We have discussed in Section 7.2 the fundamental mode in a confocal cavity. The
fundamental mode is the same for a cavity using rectangular mirrors or spherical
mirrors. The higher modes need for their description Cartesian coordinates for
rectangular mirrors and cylindical coordinates for round mirrors. In both cases
we have TEM modes characterized by three mode numbers, the ﬁrst two for the
transversal modes and the last for the longitudinal modes.
7.6.4.1
Confocal Cavity and Rectangular-Shaped Mirrors (Cartesian Coordinates)
For the higher modes of cavities with rectangular-shaped mirrors, using Cartesian
coordinates (x, y, z), the solution of the paraxial wave equation (see Eq. (7.68)),
is
ψ  Hm(√2x/w) · Hn(√2y/w) · exp{−i(P(z) + k(x2 + y2)/2q(z))},
(7.80)
where Hm(√2x/w) and Hn(√2y/w) are Hermitian polynomials, each a solution
of a differential equation written in the variable u as
d2Hm/δu2 −2u · dHm/du + 2mHm  0.
(7.81)
The indices m and n are the transverse mode numbers. The Hermitian
polynomials for m equals 0 to 3 are
H0(u)  1
H1(u)  u
(7.82)

H2(u)  4u2 −2
H3(u)  8u3 −12u.
The fundamental mode, discussed above, has the indices m  0 and n  0.
The higher modes are labeled by TEMmnq, where n and m refer to the Hermi-
tian polynomials (Eqs. (7.81) and (7.82)). They are transversal mode numbers
and correspond to the number of vertical or horizontal zero-intensity lines in the
transversal pattern. A schematic representation is given in Figure 7.20. The lon-
gitudinal mode is characterized by the large number q. Since the phase has to be
the same after one round trip, one obtains the following resonance condition,
2L/λnmq  1/2(m + n + 1) + q.
(7.83)
There are degenerate modes if m + n + 2q  m∗+ n∗+ 2q∗. For the mode
separation one has v00 q+1 −ν00q  c′/2L, where c′ is the phase velocity in the
medium of the cavity and is independent of the Fresnel number.
In FileFig 7.11 we show surface graphs of the higher-order modes in the
transversal direction from (0,0) to (2,2).

Confocal Cavity and Circular Mirrors (Cylindrical Coordinates)
For circular mirrors, one uses cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z). After rewriting
the wave equation in these coordinates, one has the solutions
ψ  (
√
2r/w)l · Ll
p(2r2/w2) · exp{−i(P(z) + kr2/2q(z))},
(7.84)
where Lpl(2r2/w2) is a generalized Laguerre polynomial. The Ll
p(2r2/w2) are
solutions of the differential equation written in the variable u,
ud2Ll
p/du2 + (l + 1 −u)dLl
p/du + pLl
p  0.
(7.85)
The index p is the radial mode number and l the angular mode number. For
p  0 to 2 we have for the polynomials
Ll
0(u)  1
(7.86)
Ll
1(u)  l + 1 −u
Ll
2(u)  (1/2)(l + 1)(l + 2) −(l + 2)u + (1/2)(u2).
(7.87)
The fundamental mode has the numbers l  0 and p  0. The modes in
confocal cavities with round mirrors are labeled by TEMlpq, where l is the
angular mode number corresponding to the number of angular zero-intensity
lines in the transversal pattern (see the schematic presentation in Fig-
ure 7.21). The radial mode number correspond to the number of zero-intensity
rings. The longitudinal mode is characterized by the large number q. The reso-
nance condition, which is the condition that the phase is the same after one round
trip, is
2L/(λlpq  (1/2)(l + 2p + 1) + q.
(7.88)
There are degenerate modes if l+2p+2q  l∗+2p∗+2q∗. The mode separation
is again independent of the Fresnel number and one has again ν00 q+1 −ν00q 
c′/2L.

INTRODUCTION
In the chapters on geometrical optics, interference, and electromagnetic theory
we have sometimes used the refractive index n  c/v. When light enters a
dielectric medium, it interacts with the atoms and changes its speed from c in
vacuum to v in the medium. The medium is called isotropic when the speed of
light is the same in all directions. The refractive index may be obtained from
the real part of the dielectric constant in Maxwell’s equations. In the case where
there are losses in the medium, light will be absorbed, and one uses the complex
dielectric constant in Maxwell’s equations.
In this chapter we ﬁrst look at the dielectric constants in Maxwell’s equations
and then use a simple model for the analytical representation. As a result we
get the index of refraction depending on the frequency of the light and model
parameters. The model we use is a damped forced oscillator. The incident light
drives these oscillators, representing the material, and loses some of its intensity.
The losses of the electromagnetic wave are described by a complex refractive
index (n −iK). In books on solid state physics the complex refractive index is
often called n + iκ (and not n −iK). We have to relate n and K or κ, called
optical constants, to the parameters of our model.

OPTICAL CONSTANTS OF DIELECTRICS
8.2.1
The Wave Equation, Electrical Polarizability, and
Refractive Index
We write Maxwell’s equations for an isotropic and nonmagnetic material without
free charges, which means we assume ∇· P  0 and ρ  0 and have
∇× E  −∂B/∂t
c2∇× B  ∂E/∂t + j/ε0
(8.1)
∇· E  0
∇· B  0,
where E is the electrical ﬁeld vector, B the magnetic ﬁeld vector, j the current
density vector ρ the charge density, and ε0  8.854×10−12 F/m, the permittivity
of vacuum. We now study the effect of an outside electrical ﬁeld on the bound
charges in an isotropic material. The outside electrical ﬁeld is assumed to be a
harmonic wave and will act on the bound charges and make them vibrate. For
the current density N of such vibrating charges we have
j  Nev,
(8.2)
where N is the number of charges per unit volume, e the charge of the electron,
and v the velocity vector. Since we assume an isotropic medium, we only have to
take into account one direction of vibration, which we call y, and one direction
of motion, which we call x. With v  dx/dt we have
jy  Ne dx/dt.
(8.3)
The induced dipoles are ex, and P  N(ex) is called the polarization. The
current density is then
jy  dPy/dt.
(8.4)
The wave equation for vibration in the y direction and propagation in the x
direction is
∂2Ey/∂x2 −(1/c2)∂2Ey/∂t2  [1/(ε0c2)]∂2Py/∂t2,
(8.5)
where the right side of Eq. (8.5) is called the source term.
In the ﬁrst approximation, we set Py proportional to the incident electrical
ﬁeld and write
Py  ε0NαEy,
(8.6)
where α is the atomic polarizability, a constant characteristic for the material.
We introduce into the wave equation a trial solution Ey  A cos(kx −ωt), and
get
−k2Ey + (1/c2)ω2Ey  (1/ε0c2)(−ω2αEy)
(8.7)

or
k2  (ω2/c2)(1 + Nα).
(8.8)
We associate the velocity v with the the phase velocity ω/k in the medium and
obtain for n
n2  c2/v2  c2k2/ω2  (1 + Nα).
(8.9)
We have obtained a relation between the optical constant n and the material
constant α, the atomic polarizability.
8.2.2
Oscillator Model and the Wave Equation
8.2.2.1
Less Dense Medium
To study the dependence of the refractive index on frequencies and losses, we
relate the refractive index to the parameters of an oscillator model.
The polarization vector P of the medium is deﬁned as the number of electrical
dipoles per unit volume. The induced electrical dipole moment is eEy, which
we now call (eu), where u is the displacement of an electron in an atom. The
number of dipoles per unit volume is N and we consider only one component of
vibration y and have
P  Neu.
(8.10)
We describe the displacement u of the charges by the vibrations of a damped
oscillator,
md2u/dt2 + mγ du/dt + mω2
0u  0,
(8.11)
where u is the displacement of the charge from its equilibrium position, m is
the mass, f the force, and γ the damping constant. The frequency without the
damping term is ω′
02  f/m, and the resonance frequency for the damped oscil-
lator is ω0 ̸ ω′
0. The electromagnetic wave of the light drives these oscillators.
The forced damped oscillator equation is
md2u/dt2 + mγ du/dt + mω2
ou  eEoe−iωt.
(8.12)
We introduce the trial solution Ae−iωt and obtain
u(t)  [eE(t)/m]/[(ω2
o −ω2) −iγ ω],
(8.13)
where E(t)  E0e−iωt. The driving electromagnetic wave produces polarization
P (t)  Neu(t)  [Ne2εoE(t)]/[mεo(ω2

(8.14)
where ε0 is the permittivity of free space. As a result of the imaginary damping
term in u(t) one has a complex susceptibility χ, indicated by a star. In Eq. (8.14)
we have related the polarization P(t) and the electrical susceptibility χ to the
parameters of our model and the electrical ﬁeld E(t) of the light.

8. OPTICAL CONSTANTS
From the wave equation, we have another expression of P(t) (see Eq. (8.6))
and introducing P(t)  ε0NαE(t) into Eq. (8.14) we get
α  (1/N)ω2
p/(ω2
0 −ω2 −iγ ω),
(8.15)
where α is the atomic polarizability and ω2
p  Ne2/mε0 the plasma frequency.
One should not confuse this with ω2
0, the square of the angular frequency of
the oscillator model, representing the dielectric. We have obtained a relation
between the material constant of the atomic polarizability α and the parameters
of our oscillator model. For the square of the refractive index, (see eq. (8.9)) we
get
(n∗)2  1 + ω2
p/(ω2
0 −ω2 −iγ ω).
(8.16)
Since (n∗)2 is a complex number, we marked it with a star. It is customary to call
the real part of the complex refractive index n, and the imaginary part K. The
imaginary part K may be called the extinction index. We have n∗ n −iK and
(n∗)2 is
(n −iK)2  1 + ω2
p/((ω2
0 −ω2) −iγ ω).
(8.17)
For the real and imaginary parts we obtain
n2 −K2  ε′  1 + ω2
p(ω2
0 −ω2)/((ω2

(8.18)
and
−2nK  ε′′  ω2
pγ ω/((ω2
0 −ω2)2 + (γ ω)2),
(8.19)
where ε′ is the real part of the dielectric constant and ε′′ is the imaginary part.
For optically thin media, such as gases, one has n close to 1 and K is small and
has the approximation
n  1 + (ω2
p/2)(ω2
0 −ω2)/((ω2
0 −ω2)2 + (γ ω)2)
(8.20)
and
K  −(ω2
p/2)γ ω/((ω2
0 −ω2)2 + (γ ω)2).
(8.21)
The damping term of the damped oscillator equation appears in the imaginary
part of n∗, indicating the losses present in the description of our model. When
the damping term is zero we get
n2  1 + (ω2
p)/(ω2
0 −ω2)
(8.22)
or
n(ω) 

(1 + [(ω2p)/(ω2

(8.23)
where ω0 is the resonance frequency of the case without losses. The refractive
index depends on the frequency and the model parameters. In Figure 8.1a the
dependence of n on the frequency is shown schematically. When γ  0 we

have singularities at the resonance frequency, and for γ ̸ 0 these singularities
are avoided. On the left side of Figure 8.1a the refractive index increases with
higher frequencies. This region is called normal dispersion, shown on a prism
on the left in Figure 8.1b. The reverse case is on the right side of Figure 8.1a,
called anomalous dispersion and shown on a prism on the right in Figure 8.1b.
In Figure 8.1c we show an absorption curve, which is the dependence of K on
the frequency.
8.2.2.2
Dense Medium
So far, in the preceding discussion, it was assumed that the local ﬁeld E0 at
the site of the oscillators is the same as the applied ﬁeld. This is only true if the
density of the oscillators in the medium is low, as it would be for a gas. For a dense
distribution of the oscillators in a solid, the surrounding area is also electrically

8. OPTICAL CONSTANTS
polarized and has an effect on the oscillator under consideration. The local ﬁeld
at the oscillator must be corrected. This is called the Lorentz correction and the
effective ﬁeld at the site of the charges is
E + (1/3ε0)P.
(8.24)
Using P  ε0NαE we have
Py  ε0Nα{Ey + (Py/3ε0)}.
(8.25)
Similar to the low density case, using Eq. (8.9), the square of the refractive index
for the denser medium is
n2  1 + Nα/(1 −(Nα/3).
(8.26)
This equation may also be written as
3(n2 −1)/(n2 + 2)  Nα
(8.27)
and is called the Clausius–Mossotti equation, or with the parameters of our
model,
n2  1 + 3ε0ω2

p}.
(8.28)
We have in a solid that the interaction between the oscillators becomes very
strong. The oscillation frequencies are modiﬁed and the damping constants
become large. In addition, in crystals the periodicity must be taken into account.

DETERMINATION OF OPTICAL CONSTANTS
8.3.1
Fresnel’s Formulas and Reﬂection Coefﬁcients
The determination of the two parts n and K of the complex refractive index may
be accomplished by using reﬂection measurements. In Chapter 5 we found that
Fresnel’s formulas relate the reﬂection coefﬁcients of the p- and s-polarization
cases to the real index of refraction. In a similar way to that of Chapter 5, one can
show that the complex reﬂection coefﬁcients are related to complex refractive
indices through Fresnel’s formulas. Replacing n2 by n∗
2  n2 −iK2 we have for
the reﬂection coefﬁcients
r∗
∥ (n2 −iK2) cos θ −n1 cos θ′′
(n2 −iK2) cos θ + n1 cos θ′′
(8.29)
r∗
⊥ n1 cos θ −(n2 −iK2) cos θ′′
n1 cos θ + (n2 −iK2) cos θ′′ .
(8.30)
In order to represent r∥and r⊥depending on the angle of incidence. We need the
law of refraction in complex terms (see FileFig 8.4 (M4SNELL) of Chapter 5).
The law of refraction is
n1 sin θ  (n2 −iK2) sin θ′′.
(8.31)

8.3. DETERMINATION OF OPTICAL CONSTANTS
315
The angle θ′′ must be a complex quantity since the left side of Eq. (8.31) is real.
Introduction of Eq. (8.31) into Eqs. (8.29) and (8.30) gives us

(8.33)
In FileFig 8.1 we have graphs of the absolute value and the argument for re-
ﬂected amplitudes of the parallel (zrp) and perpendicular (zrs) cases depending
on n and K. For K ̸ 0 we see from the ﬁrst graph that for the parallel case
the minimum corresponding to the Brewster angle is not zero. The angle at the
minimum is called the principal angle. The second graph shows the phase jump
at the Brewster angle, which is now a smooth transition. In the application of
FileFig 8.1, Section 3, we plot the parallel (zrp) and perpendicular (zrs) cases
for several different values of n and K on the same graph.
FileFig 8.1
(O1FRNKPSS)
Graphs are shown for reﬂected amplitudes of the parallel (zrp) and perpendicular
(zrs) cases depending on n and K for n1  1. For both cases the absolute value
of the reﬂected amplitudes and the phase angle are plotted for n1  1, n2  1.5,
and K  2.
O1FRNKPSS is only on the CD.
Application 8.1.
1. Make a graph and ﬁnd the values of the principal angle for one value of n
and three values of K.
2. Make a graph and ﬁnd the values of the principal angle for one value of K
and three values of n.
3. Observe that the curve of arg(zrp(θ)) is not continuously approaching the
curve of arg(zrp0(θ)) when K is going from 0.01 to zero. What is the
remaining phase difference?
8.3.2
Ratios of the Amplitude Reﬂection Coefﬁcients
Equations (8.32) and (8.33) give the dependence of the reﬂection coefﬁcients
on n and K. We have the general problem that we cannot represent n and K as
functions of rs and rp. This is only possible for approximations, (see Appendix
8.1), and other methods have to be considered.

316
8. OPTICAL CONSTANTS
One method is to apply reﬂection measurements at several angles of incidence
to determine the absolute values of the ratio rs/rp. The ratio rs/rp is calculated
similarly to that done by Born and Wolf (1964, p.617).
From Chapter 5 the ratio r⊥/r∥from Fresnel’s formulas is
r⊥/r∥ [(n1 cos θ −n2 cos θ′′)/(n1 cos θ + n2 cos θ′′)]
[(n2 cos θ −n1 cos θ′′)/(n2 cos θ + n1 cos θ′′)].
(8.34)
Using the law of refraction and the trigonometric formula for the sum of angles
cos(a ± b)  cos a cos b ± sin a sin b
(8.35)
we get
| rs/rp || cos(θ −θ′′)/ cos(θ + θ′′) | .
(8.36)
In FileFig 8.2 we show graphs of the real parts of rp and rs for various values
of n and K. The third graph shows the ratio rp/rs and the fourth rs/rp. From
these two graphs it appears that the ratio rp/rs is much more useful for the
determination of optical constants than the ratios rs/rp, because they are smooth
and do not show a resonance, related to the appearance of the Brewster angle.
The optical constants may be obtained by measuring values of |rp/rs| for two
different angles of θ, and solving the two equations for the unknowns n and K.

where A is a general constant, S the oscillator strength, γ the damping constant,

This is called a Sellmeier-type equation and has been used, for example, to ﬁt
the data for potassium bromide in the spectral region from .2 to 42 microns using
11 empirical constants.1 An example is given in FileFig 8.4.
When ﬁtting experimental data one has to keep in mind that n and K are not
independent. They are related by the Kramer–Kroning model.2 In some spec-
tral regions, for example in the x-ray region, one obtains the K value from
absorption measurements and calculates the corresponding n value with the
Kramer–Kroning model.

OPTICAL CONSTANTS OF METALS
8.4.1
Drude Model
In Section 8.2 we discussed the optical constants of dielectrics and in Section 8.3
their determination. We now discuss metals and how their optical constants are
also described by a complex refractive index. The determination of the n and
K values for metals is similar to what has been discussed before, but the model
representing the material is different.
Metals show high reﬂectivity in the visible and infrared spectral regions and
their attenuation increases with lower frequencies. The values of real and imag-
inary parts of the refractive index of metals are in the lower frequency region
which is much higher than one usually ﬁnds for dielectrics.
The interaction of the electromagnetic wave with the metal is described by
the Drude model. The electrons are assumed to move almost freely in the metal
and there is no restoring force to make the electrons vibrate, as discussed for
the dielectric. For an isotropic medium with free conducting charges we write
Maxwell’s equations as
∇× E  −∂B/∂t
c2∇× B  ∂E/∂t + j/ε0
(8.41)
∇· E  0
∇· B  0.
This is similar to Eq. (8.1). For the current density vector j we take
j  Nevj,
(8.42)
where vj is called the drift velocity. The electrical ﬁeld of the light and the
current density in the material are related by the wave equation. We assume E
and j are vibrating in the y direction and propagating in the x direction and from
Eq. (8.41) we get for the wave equation
∂2Ey/∂x2 −(1/c2)∂2Ey/∂t2  [1/(c2ε0)]∂jy/∂t.
(8.43)
As in Section 8.2, we now ﬁnd an expression for jy in terms of the parameters of
the damped oscillator model and the vibrating electrical ﬁeld E0. The differential
equation of the model is now without the force term,
md2u/dt2 + mγ du/dt  eE0e−iωt.
(8.44)

8.4. OPTICAL CONSTANTS OF METALS
321
The general solution of Eq. (8.44) is the sum of the solutions of the homogeneous
and inhomogeneous equations. For the homogeneous equation,
md2u/dt2 + mγ du/dt  0.
(8.45)
Using the trial solution u  u0e−t/τ, we get for γ  τ −1. Typically one has a
value of 10−13 for τ and we neglect this solution.
The inhomogeneous equation may be rewritten, using v  du/dt, as
mdv/dt + mγ v  eE0e−iωt,
(8.46)
Using the trial solution v  v0e−iωt one obtains
v0  E0(e/m)/(γ −iω).
(8.47)
The current density j0  Nev0 can be expressed as
j0  (τE0)(Ne2/m)/(1 −iωτ)  (σE0)/(1 −iωτ),
(8.48)
where we used j0  Nev0, γ  τ −1, and the static conductivity
σ  τNe2/m.
(8.49)
Equation (8.48) relates the current density j0 of our model to the electrical ﬁeld
E0 of the light, vibrating with angular frequency ω.
We now turn to the wave equation, (see Eq. (8.43)), using the trial solutions
Ey  E0ei(kx−ωt)
and
jy  j0ei(kx−ωt)
(8.50)
and introducing j0 from our model, Eq. (8.48), we obtain for the complex wave
vector k∗
(k∗)2  1/c2{ω2 + (iσω/ε0)/(1 −iωτ)}
(8.51)
and the complex refractive index n∗ k∗c2/ω2,
(n∗)2  1 + iσ/{ωε0(1 −iωτ)}  1 −σ/{ωε0(i + ωτ)}.
(8.52)
Equation (8.52) relates the refractive index to the static conductivity of the metal
σ, the frequency of light ω and the relaxation time τ, which is a parameter of
our model and is related to the metal. In FileFig 8.5 we show graphs over a large
frequency region of the real and imaginary parts of Eq. (8.52).
8.4.2
Low Frequency Region
For low frequencies, that is, when ωτ ≪1, we may neglect ωτ with respect to
i (see Eq. (8.52)), and get
(n∗)2  1 + iσ/ωε0.
(8.53)
Since ω is small, which means iσ/ωε0 is large compared to 1, we write
n −iK  (
√
i)(

σ/ωε0).
(8.54)

322
8. OPTICAL CONSTANTS
Using the identity
√
i  (1 + i)/
√
2 one has
| n || K | (

σ/2ωε0);
(8.55)
that is, n and K have the same value and the wave is strongly attenuated in
the medium. To ﬁnd the frequency limit of Eq. (8.55), we have from ωτ ≪1,
that ω << 1/τ, with τ  mσ/Ne2. For copper we have σ  5.76 107 (ohm
meter)−1, N  8.5 1028 meter−3, e  1.6 10−19 coulomb, m  9.11 10−31 kgm,
and obtain for 1/τ  4.1 1013 1/sec. Therefore this approximation is valid for
angular frequencies smaller than 1011 −1012 Hz, which are lower frequencies
than the far infrared. This approximation is plotted in FileFig 8.5 as the last graph.
The light is strongly attenuated when entering metals in this spectral region and
is therefore highly reﬂected (see also FileFig 8.7).
8.4.3
High Frequency Region
For high frequencies we have ωτ ≫1, and from Eq. (8.52) one has
n2  1 −σ/ω2τε0.
(8.56)
Using Eq. (8.49) and the plasma frequency ωp  Ne2/mε0 we have
n2  1 −ω2
p/ω2.
(8.57)
The plasma frequency ωp  Ne2/mε0 has the value 1.6 1016 1/sec when using
N  8.5 1028 meter−3, e  1.6 10−19 coulomb, ε0  8.85 10−12 farad-meter−1,
and m  9.11 10−31 kg. Therefore the approximation of Eq. (8.57) is valid for
angular frequencies larger than 1018, corresponding to the x ray region. This is
also plotted in FileFig 8.5 on the third graph. In this region the refractive index n
is real and less than 1 and light is penetrating the metal without being attenuated.
We see that the plasma frequency divides the frequency range into two parts.
One for high frequencies when n is smaller than 1 and one for low frequencies
when n is complex (see Eq. (8.53)).

Skin Depth
In the low frequency region, where the light is strongly attenuated in the metal,
the light may only penetrate into the metal a small distance, called the skin depth.
An incident wave u0 exp −i(ωt + kX) may be written with complex k∗as
u  u0 exp −iωt exp −i{(n −iK)ωX/c}.

We write Eq. (8.58) in real and complex factors as
u  u0 exp −(ωKX/c) exp −iω{t −nX/c}.

Reﬂectance at Normal Incidence and Reﬂection
Coefﬁcients with Absorption
We have seen in Section 8.3 that the r∥component is not zero at the principal
angle, which means the angle corresponding to the Brewster’s angle for the case
of the lossless dielectric. The reﬂectance R is equal to the square of the reﬂection
coefﬁcients of Fresnel’s formulas, (Eq. (8.32) and (8.33)) and is valid for both
dielectric and metals if the corresponding values of n and K are used. For normal
incidence, when the parallel and perpendicular components are the same we have

328
8. OPTICAL CONSTANTS
for the reﬂectance R,
R  (1 −n)2 + K2/[(1 + n)2 + K2].
(8.63)
In FileFig 8.7 we show for normal incidence the dependence of the reﬂectance
R on K. When K  0 we go back to Fresnels formulas, depending only on the
real part of the refractive index, as discussed in Chapter 5 for lossless dielectrics.
When K is large, we have high reﬂectance R as observed for metals.

8.4.6
Elliptically Polarized Light
We mentioned in Chapter 5 that elliptically polarized light may be produced
when light is totally internally reﬂected in a dielectric medium. Reﬂection on
metal surfaces shows a similar phenomenon. The reﬂection coefﬁcients rp and rs
may have arguments depending on the angle of incidence. Since each component
picks up a different change in the argument, the difference of the arguments of
the reﬂected components is not the same and corresponds to the angle φ of
elliptically polarized light, as discussed in Chapter 5.
In FileFig 8.8 we have plotted the difference of the phase angles after
reﬂection, depending on the angle of incidence.

Analytical Expressions and Approximations for the
Determinaton of n and K
As discussed in Section 3.2 there are approximate methods to represent n and
K analytically. We show that an approximation is used to get formulas for n
and K depending on the ratio of rs to rp, the phase difference @ of rs and rp
after reﬂection, and the angle of incidence θ. This method is called ellipsometry
because one measures the absolute value of the ratio rs to rp and the phase
difference @ of rs and rp; see Section 8.4.6. Using the law of refraction one may
rewrite Fresnel’s formulas for ratios rs and rp as
rs  (−1) sin(θ −θ′′)/sin(θ + θ′′)
(A8.1)
rp  tan(θ −θ′′)/ tan(θ + θ′′),
(A8.2)
and obtain for rs/rp
rs/rp  −{cos(θ −θ′′)/ cos(θ + θ′′)}.
(A8.3)
The ratio rs/rp may be complex, and therefore we call P the absolute value of
the ratio rs/rp, and @ the argument.
Pe−i@  rs/rp  −cos(θ −θ′′)/ cos(θ + θ′′).
(A8.4)
Using the formula for the sum and difference of angles in a cosine function one
may write
(1 −Pe−i@)/(1 + Pe−i@)  −(cos θ cos θ′′)/(sin θ sin θ′′)
(A8.5)
and with the complex law of refraction
(1 −Pe−i@)/(1 + Pe−i@)  (−1)

{n
′∗2 −(sin θ)2}/(sin θ)(tan θ).
(A8.6)
By using P  tan ψ one can write for the left side of Eq. (A8.6),
(1 −tan ψe−i@)/(1 + tan ψe−i@)
 (cos 2ψ + i sin @ sin 2ψ)/(1 + cos @ sin 2ψ)
(A8.7)
and one has for Eq. (A8.7)

{n
′∗2 −(sin θ)2}
 −(sin θ)(tan θ)(cos 2ψ + i sin @ sin 2ψ)/(1 + cos @ sin 2ψ).
(A8.8)
We obtain for n′ and K′ the complex expression
n′ + iK′


[(sin θ)2 + {(sin θ)(tanθ)(cos 2ψ + i sin @ sin 2ψ)/(1 + cos @ sin 2ψ)}2].
(A8.9)

330
8. OPTICAL CONSTANTS
In order to get to n′ and K′ we have to determine the real and imaginary parts of
the right side of Eq. (A8.9). As done in Born and Wolf (1964, p. 619), one can
make an approximation by neglecting in the square root of Eq. (A8.8) the term
(sin θ)2 with respect to n
′∗2, and obtain explicit expressions for n′ and K′:
n′  {(sin θ)(tan θ)(cos 2ψ)}/{1 + cos @ sin 2ψ}
(A8.10)
K′  {(sin θ)(tan θ)(sin @)(sin 2ψ)}/{1 + cos @ sin 2ψ}.
(A8.11)
We show in FileFig 8.9, graphs of P, @, and ψ depending on the angle of
incidence θ. These graphs are for speciﬁc values of n and K. A comparison of
the exact and approximate calculation, again for speciﬁc values of n and K, is
shown in FileFig 8.10. In praxis one often uses iteration for the determination
of n′ and K′ and uses more than two input data for a best ﬁt calculation.

FOURIER TRANSFORMATION
9.1.1
Introduction
In this chapter we present some basic properties of Fourier transformation and
applications of Fourier transform spectroscopy. A simple example of an applica-
tion of Fourier transformation is the determination of the frequencies one needs
to compose a function f (x), presenting a rectangular pulse. Such a pulse may be
generated by superposition of many monochromatic waves with many different
wavelengths and amplitudes. The input data to Fourier transformation are the
space coordinates of f (x). The result of Fourier transformation is the frequency
spectrum corresponding to the different wavelengths used to compose f (x). A
more complicated application is the analysis of the interferogram obtained from
incident light traversing an absorbing material. The Fourier transformation of
the interferogram will calculate the absorption spectrum of the material.
The discussion uses a considerable number of examples and not much of the
mathematical theory of Fourier transformations. Most important is numerical
Fourier transformation, available in most computational computer programs and
applied in Fourier transform spectroscopy.
9.1.2
The Fourier Integrals
The integrals we used in the far ﬁeld approximation of the Kirchhoff–Fresnel
diffraction theory are Fourier integrals. The integral transforms the “input func-
tion” (in our case the aperture function), into the “output function” (in our case
the diffraction pattern). For the example of the diffraction at a slit, the aper-
ture function is the “(double) step function” S(y) and is transformed into the
331

diffraction pattern G(ν). The step function is deﬁned as
S(y) 



0
for ∞to d/2
1
for d/2 to −d/2
0
for −d/2 to −∞,
(9.1)
and the Fourier integral transforms S(y) into the Fourier transform G(ν).
Using slightly different coordinates from those in Chapter 3, we have that the
Fourier transform of S(y) is G(ν).
G(ν) 
∞
∫
−∞S(y)e−i2πνydy.
(9.2)
From Fourier transform theory we ﬁnd that the inverse relationship is also true
and we have the Fourier transform of (note the plus sign in the exponent)
S(y) 
∞
∫
−∞G(ν)ei2πνydν.
(9.3)
Bothvariablesν andy havecontinuousvaluesfrom−∞to+∞.Thevariabley is
the variable in the space domain and the variable ν is the variable in the frequency
domain and has the dimension of 1/space coordinate. (In infrared spectroscopy
one uses as the unit cm−1). Both G(ν) and S(y) are not normalized. When G(ν)
is symmetric with respect to zero, the integral may be written as
S(y)  2
∞
∫
0
G(ν) cos(2πνy)dν.
(9.4)
We now discuss some analytical Fourier transformations.
9.1.3
Examples of Fourier Transformations Using
Analytical Functions
We present two examples to calculate the Fourier transformation, and the Fourier
transformation of the Fourier transformation. We show that the latter is indeed
the original function.
9.1.3.1
Gauss Function
We consider
S(y)  exp(−a2y2/2).
(9.5)
We insert it into the integral of Eq. (9.2) and use the integral formula
∞
∫
0
exp(−c2x2) cos(bx)dx  (√π/2c) exp(−b2/4c2)
(9.6)
and obtain
G(ν)  (
√
2π/a) exp(−2π2ν2/a2).
(9.7)

9.1. FOURIER TRANSFORMATION
333
If we take the function G(ν)  (
√
2π/a) exp(−2π2ν2/a2) and insert it into
Eq. (9.3) and use the same integral formula, we get back the original function
S(y):
S(y)  exp(−a2y2/2).
(9.8)
This example shows that the Fourier transformation of the Fourier transformation
reproduces the original function.
9.1.3.2
The Functions 1/(1 + x2) and πe−2πν
If we use
S(y)  1/(1 + y2)
(9.9)
and apply the integral formula
∞
∫
0
{(cos ax)/(1 + x2)}dx  (π/2)e−a,
(9.10)
we obtain
G(ν)  πe−2πν,
(9.11)
and for the Fourier transform of G(ν) we ﬁnd the original function by using the
integral formula
∞
∫
0
e−ax cos mxdx  a/(a2 + m2).
(9.12)
As result we ﬁnd that the Fourier transform of 1/(1 + y2) is πe−2πν, and the
Fourier transform of πe−2πν is 1/(1 + y2):
e−2πν ↔1/(1 + y2).
(9.13)
These two examples are exceptions to the point of view that one may calculate
analytically the Fourier transformation and that one can get analytically the
inverse Fourier transformation. A simple example when this is not the case is
the Fourier transformation of the step function S(y) of Eq. (9.1). The Fourier
transformationisafunctionofthetype(sin aν)/aν,anditsFouriertransformmay
not be calculated analytically because the result of the Fourier transformation of
(sin aν)/aν is a discontinuous function. However, using numerical methods, one
may perform the Fourier Transformation and the inverse Fourier transformation.
9.1.4
Numerical Fourier Transformation
9.1.4.1
Fast Fourier Transformation
For numerical calculations of Fourier transformations we use the fast Fourier
transformation program, available in most computational computer programs.

334
9. FOURIER TRANSFORMATION AND FT-SPECTROSCOPY
Real Fourier Transformation (ff t)
This program (ff t) is used for real input data and works with 2n input and 2n−1
output points. For a real Fourier transformation we have, from Eq. (9.4),
S(y)  2
∞
∫
0
G(ν) cos(2πνy)dν.
(9.14)
This integral may be written as
0
∫
−∞G(ν) cos(2πνy)dν +
∞
∫
0
G(ν) cos(2πνy)dν.
(9.15)
The ﬁrst term over the negative part of ν is the “mirror” image around 0 of the
second term over the positive part. Negative frequencies are a formality in Fourier
transformations. They may be eliminated in order to correlate to observable
results.
The input data of the Fast Fourier transformation is arranged in such a way
that the negative part of the Fourier transformation follows the positive part. Let
us assume we have a total of 128 points. The positive part is from point 1 to 64,
and the negative part follows as a “mirror image” from 65 to 128. The frequency
content of the negative part is the same as that of the positive part. The fast
Fourier transformation therefore considers only one part, analyzes it, and plots
the determined frequencies for only 1/2 of the total points (in our example for
64 points). The inverse transformation (iff t) works backward. It has 64 input
points, but takes care of the imaginary part and again ends up with 128 output
points. The Fourier transform program of Mathcad numbers 26  64 points from
0 to 63, and 27  128 points from 0 to 127.
We demonstrate in FileFig 9.1 the real Fourier transformation of a single-sided
step function with 256 points. For comparison in FileFig 9.2, we demonstrate the
real Fourier transformation of a double-sided step function with 256 points. Both
show the same transformation with 128 points, and the inverse transformation
for both is the original function.

Complex Fourier Transformation (cff t)
We saw in FileFigs 9.1 and 9.2 that the real Fourier transformation of the step
function, which is real, has a nonzero imaginary part. The imaginary part of the
transformations is different for the original single- and double-sided step func-
tions. To learn more about real and complex Fourier transformations, we apply

338

the complex Fourier transform in FileFig 9.3 to the single-sided step function
and in FileFig 9.4 to the double-sided step function.
The complex Fourier transformation program (cff t) works with 2n input
and 2n output points. The inverse transformation (icff t) works backwards with
2n input points and 2n output points. The imaginary part of the transformation
is again different for the single- and double-sided original step functions. The
inverse transformation reproduces the original function.

We now discuss the case where G(ν) is the product of two functions g1(ν) and
g2(ν),
G(ν)  g1(ν)g2(ν).
(9.17)
In the cases where one wants to keep the two functions separate, one can represent
the Fourier transformation of G(ν) by a convolution integral. The convolution
integral theorem tells us that we may write the Fourier transform of the product
g1(ν)g2(ν) as the convolution integral of the Fourier transformations of g1(ν)
and g2(ν). The Fourier transformation of g1(ν) is
s1(y) 

(9.18)
and of g2(ν)
s2(y) 

(9.19)
The Fourier transform S(y) of the product G(ν)  g1(ν)g2(ν) is calculated from
the convolution integral
S(y) 

−∞s1(τ)s2(y −τ)dτ,
(9.20)
where s1(y) and s2(y) are the Fourier transforms of g1(ν) and g2(ν) (see
Eqs. (9.18) and (9.19)).
A simple example can be discussed by splitting the Gauss function
G(ν)  exp −(a2ν2)/2
(9.21)
into two, as
exp −(3/4)(a2ν2)/2
(9.22)
exp −(1/4)(a2ν2)/2.
(9.23)
We calculate the Fourier transform of Eqs. (9.22) and (9.23) as
s1(y) 

Superposition of Cosine Waves
We next discuss the superposition of plane waves in order to understand the
formulas of Fourier transform spectroscopy. We consider a plane wave solution
of the scalar wave equation
u(x, t)  A cos 2π(x/λ −t/T + φ).
(9.33)

9.2. FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROSCOPY
345
In Chapter 2 we discussed the dependence on x and t and on the phase factor φ.
We write the two cosine waves with path difference x2  x1 −δ as
u1(x, t)  A cos 2π(x1/λ −t/T )
(9.34)
u2(x, t)  A cos 2π[(x1 −δ)/λ −t/T ].
(9.35)
Using the formula
cos α + cos β  2[cos(α + β)/2][cos(α −β)/2],
(9.36)
we may write for the superposition u  u1 + u2,
u  u1 + u2
 2A[cos(2π(δ/2)/λ)]{cos[2π(x1/λ −t/T ) −2π(δ/2)/λ]}
(9.37)
and obtain for the intensity
I  {2A[cos(2π(δ/2)/λ)]}2.{cos[2π(x1/λ −t/T ) −2π(δ/2)/λ]}2.
(9.38)
Only the second factor depends on the time. Since it oscillates very quickly;
we can assume that only the average value is detected and results in a constant.
Therefore we have
I  {2A cos(2π(δ/2)/λ)}2
(times a constant).
(9.39)
We see that the intensity of the superposition of the two harmonic waves depends
only on the optical path difference δ.
9.2.2
Michelson Interferometer and Interferograms
The Michelson interferometer (see Figure 9.1) has been discussed in Chapter 2,
and we assume that an ideal beam splitter reﬂects and transmits 50% of the
incident light. The incident beam is divided at the beam splitter and each beam
is reﬂected at one of the two mirrors M1 and M2. Part of the reﬂected beam from
M1 is transmitted, and part of the beam coming from M2 is reﬂected. These two
parts are superimposed and travel to the detector.
The optical path difference is introduced by the displacement of the mirror
M2. If the mirror is displaced by nδ/2, the optical path difference is nδ for each
wavelength component of the incident beam. The center position is at δ  0.
There we have constructed interference for all wavelengths. For constructed
interference in the direction of the detector, for a speciﬁc wavelength no light
travels back to the source. For destructive interference in the direction of the
detector, the light travels back to the source.
Since only the space dependence of the harmonic wave is of importance we
write the amplitude of the input wave as
u1(x)  A cos 2π(x1/λ).
(9.40)

9. FOURIER TRANSFORMATION AND FT-SPECTROSCOPY
FIGURE 9.1
Schematic of Michelson interfometer. The optical path difference x2 −x1  δ/2 is

The superposition of the two waves emerging from the beam splitter is (see
Eq. (9.38))
u(δ)  B cos(2π(δ/2)/λ),
(9.41)
where B is a constant. For the intensity we obtain
I(δ)  {B cos(2π(δ/2)/λ)}2,
(9.42)
where B2 represents the effective intensity at the detector for δ  0.(Note the
factor 1
2 in the argument which comes from δ/2 in Eq. (9.39)).
So far we have assumed for the input wave (Eq. (9.40)) only one wavelength
or one frequency. The case of interest for Fourier transform spectroscopy is the
determination of the frequency spectrum when the incident wave contains many
frequencies. We assume that we have p waves of amplitude Ai and (discrete)
wavelength λi which as frequencies we write as νi  1/λi in cm−1. The input
of the sum of waves (amplitudes) is
u 

and for the intensity of the output at the detector one has
I(y) 

(9.44)
where y is the optical path difference produced by the two mirrors. Each of the
incident waves in the sum of Eq. (9.43) will separately produce a superposition
pattern and all intensity patterns will be superimposed (see Eq. (9.44)). We apply

9.2. FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROSCOPY

to each term the formula
cos2 α  (1/2)(1 + cos 2α)
(9.45)
and obtain
I(y) 

(9.46)
Note that the factor 1/2 in the argument of Eq. (9.44) has now disappeared.
Although we need a discontinuous representation for the realistic case of Fourier
transform spectroscopy, we use integral presentation for the manipulations to
obtain the interferogram function.
9.2.3
The Fourier Transform Integral
In Fourier transform spectroscopy we observe the intensity pattern at the detector,
depending on a “length” coordinate, and calculate the frequency pattern using
Fourier transformation.
We now consider a continuous frequency distribution from ν  0 to v  ∞
and write Eq. (9.46) as an integral over dν,
J(y)  2
 ∞
0
G(ν){1 + cos(2πνy)}dν,
(9.47)
where we have replaced C2
j by the continuous function G(ν) and the sum by an
integral. For the speciﬁc case of y  0 we get
J(0)  4
∞
∫
0
G(ν)dν.
(9.48)
Fourier integrals need for ν and y the range from −∞to ∞. We therefore
formally extend the frequency range by assuming that G(ν) is symmetric around
ν  0 and therefore that G(−ν)  G(ν). For Eq. (9.48) we then may write
J(0)  2
∞
∫
−∞G(ν)dν
(9.49)
and write for the cos-function in Eq. (9.47) the corresponding exponential,
including negative frequencies, and get
J(y) 
∞
∫
−∞G(ν){1 + ei(2πνy)}dν.
(9.50)
Introduction of Eq. (9.49) into Eq. (9.50) gives us
J(y)  (1/2)J(0) +
∞
∫
−∞G(ν){ei(2πνy)}dν.
(9.51)
The function J(y) contains the observed data.

348
9. FOURIER TRANSFORMATION AND FT-SPECTROSCOPY
We deﬁne the interferogram function S(y) as
S(y)  J(y) −(1/2)J(0) 
∞
∫
−∞G(ν){ei(2πνy)}dν.
(9.52)
The subtraction of 1/2 J(0) from J(y) produces negative values for S(y) and
makes it a Fourier integral of the type we have discussed above. If a double-
sided interferogram is obtained, y runs from negative to positive values related
to the position of the mirror M2 of the Michelson interferometer. Using the
fast Fourier transformation, we can only consider 2n points. The input function
starts with the positive part of S(y) and the negative part follows as a mirror
image. Therefore, the information we are interested in is only contained in the
single-sided interferogram.
The integral S(y) is one of the pair of Fourier transform integrals
S(y) 
∞
∫
−∞G(ν){ei(2πνy)}dν.
(9.53)
The other is
G(v) 
∞
∫
−∞(S(y){e−i(2πνy)}dy.
(9.54)
(Note the negative sign in the exponent.) The integral of Eq. (9.54) is the one
we need to calculate the frequency spectrum of the observed data, presented by
S(y).
We have assumed that both variables ν and y have continuous values from
−∞to +∞. When G(ν) and S(y) are symmetrical with respect to zero, the
imaginary part disappears and one has to deal only with one side of the integral.
The Fourier transformation pairs are then
S(y)  2

G(ν){cos(2πνy)}dν
(9.55)
G(ν)  2

9.2.4
Discrete Length and Frequency Coordinates
9.2.4.1
Discrete Length Coordinates
The Fourier integral of Eq. (9.56) is the Fourier transformation of the
interferogram function. For numerical calculations it is written as
G(νi) 
n

k1
S(yk) cos(2πνiyk).
(9.57)
Since the coordinates νi and yk each have n discrete values, the Fourier
transformation is equivalent to the solution of a system of n linear equations.

9.2. FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROSCOPY
349
The input data of the interferogram function S(yk) are the measured data. The
mirror M2 of the Michelson interferometer (Figure 9.1) is moved at equal steps
from one position to the next, and the values of the interferogram are recorded at
the detector. The zero path length position is the location of the central maximum.
The input values of the interferogram function S(yk) are calculated by subtraction
of half the value of the central maximum (Eq. (9.52)).
In the cosine functions of Eq. (9.57) we have a set of values of yk and as a
consequence we have a repetition of possible values of νi. Let us choose for the
length interval yk  k, which means we have 128 points from k  1 to 128, and
consider
cos[2π(νik)].
(9.58)
When k is 128, and νi is 1/128 we have νik  1, which means all values of the
cosine are in one cycle for k  1 to 128 and νi  1/128. When the product (νik)
is larger than 1, we have repetition. Let us assume the value νi  133/128 
1 + 5/128,
cos[2π(133/128)k]  cos[2π(1 + 5/128)k]
(9.59)
 cos[2π(5/128)k).
Because of the periodicity of the cos-function, the frequency νi  133/128
is equivalent to νi  5/128. When using k  1 to 128 points in the space
coordinate domain, after application of the Fourier transformation, all that we
can get are 128 frequencies in the frequency domain. The repetition at 2π is
shown in FileFig 9.12. In addition, the cos-functions of Eq. (9.57) have “mirror”
symmetry at the center of the interval (at i  64), and at both ends (shown in
FileFig 9.13). In FileFig 9.14 graphs are shown of amplitudes and intensities
of the superposition of cosine waves. These superpositions are simulations of
interferograms depending on the optical path difference.

cos(2πνik) for 63/128, 64/128, and 65/128 shows that the frequency of 63/128
appears similar to 65/128 and both have a larger cycle than 64/128.

9.2.4.2
Sampling
We have seen in FileFig 9.13 that the cos-function of Eq. (9.57) has a symmetrical
appearance around the frequency position 64/128, when using 128 points in
space and having exactly two space points per cycle. For this special example
two points per cycle have been used for the characterization of the frequencies.
In general, we have from information theory the sampling theorem.
Theorem 9.1. Two points per cycle are needed for sampling a continuous
periodic function in order not to lose information.
In our example, the continuous functions are cos-functions. The cos-function
with the highest frequency is sampled by using two points per cycle. For exam-
ple, one is at the maximum and one is at the minimum. Lower frequencies are
also correctly sampled, but higher frequencies present a problem. They appear
as lower frequencies and need to be removed by a ﬁlter. When talking about
wavelengths instead of frequencies, we similarly have that the sampling inter-
val is equal to one-half of the wavelength of the shortest wavelength (highest
frequency). Calling the sampling interval l, we have
l  1/(2νM),
(9.60)
where νM isthehighestfrequency of thespectrumunderconsideration.InFourier
transform spectroscopy it is assumed that all higher frequencies are removed.

9.2. FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROSCOPY

9.2.5
Folding of the Fourier Transform Spectrum
What happens when the choice of the sampling interval is done incorrectly? How
is the spectrum affected? We show that higher frequencies are folded around the
highest frequency, corresponding to the correct sampling interval, and appear
as lower frequencies in the spectrum. We use for the space domain the coor-
dinate points 1/256, 2/256, . . . , 1 and consider the sum of cos-functions with
frequencies 65, 85, and 105.
1. The sampling interval is 1/256. We have
y1i  cos(2π · 65(i/256) + cos(2π · 85(i/256)
+ cos(2π · 105(i/256),
(9.61)
where i runs from 1 to 256.
2. The sampling interval is 2/256. We consider
y2i  cos(2π · 65(2i/256) + cos(2π · 85(2i/256)
+ cos 2π105(2i/256),
(9.62)
where i runs from 1 to 256.
3. The sampling interval is 4/256. We have
y4i  cos(2π · 65(4i/256) + cos(2π · 85(4i/256)
+ cos(2π · 105(4i/256),
(9.63)
where i runs from 1 to 256.
In FileFig 9.15 we compare the appearance of the spectrum for these three
sampling intervals 1/256, 2/256 and 4/256.
FileFig 9.15
(F15FOLDS)
Folding of the spectrum:
1. Sampling interval 1/256 for the function y1. The three frequencies to be
investigated are 65, 85, and 105. The highest frequency is 128. All frequencies
appear at the right place in the Fourier transformation spectrum.
2. Sampling interval 2/256 for function y2. We now use a sampling interval
twice as large. Consequently the highest frequency is now 64 and the three
frequencies 65, 85, and 105 are all higher than 64. The spectrum appears
folded. In the Fourier transformation the three frequencies appear at 45, 85,
and 125. Since the frequency spectrum is shown over 128 points, we may
look at the function y2 as it would have frequencies 2 · 65, 2 · 85 and 2 · 105.
It is sampled with the sampling interval 1/256 (as we did under (a), where the
highest frequency is 128. We then have to look for the frequencies 130, 170,
and 210, which all exceed the frequency interval from 1 to 128. We saw in

352
9. FOURIER TRANSFORMATION AND FT-SPECTROSCOPY
FileFigs 9.12 and 13 that higher frequencies are folded back into the spectrum
around the highest frequency (which is 128 because we sample y2 now like
y1). We have to subtract from 130, 170, and 210 the highest frequency 128
and ﬁnd 2, 42, and 82. These values have to be traced back from 128 because
of the folding. We get 126, 86, and 46, which are the frequencies we should
ﬁnd in the graph of the Fourier transformation. However, we ﬁnd 125, 85,
45 because we have not taken into account that the Fourier transformation
program starts at 0 and not at 1.
3. Sampling interval 4/256 for function y4. We now use a sampling interval
4/256 to sample the same function with 4/256. The highest frequency is now
32. In the Fourier transformation the three frequencies appear at 5, 85, and
90. Since the frequency spectrum is shown over 128 points, we look at y4
as it would have frequencies 4 · 65, 4 · 85, and 4 · 105. It is sampled with
the sampling interval 1/256, as y1 was. We have to look for the frequencies
260, 340, and 420, which all exceed the frequency interval from 1 to 128.
We saw in FileFigs.12 and 13 that higher frequencies are folded back into
the spectrum around the highest frequency (which is 128 because we sample
y4 now like y1). We have to subtract from 260, 340, and 420 the highest
frequency 128, and get 132, 212, and 293. Then we have to trace back from
128, because they all exceed 128 and get 4, 84, and 165 and have to fold
again at 0 into forward (i.e., 4, 84, and 165). The ﬁrst two are now in the right
position, but 165 exceeds 128. We have to subtract 128 from 165 which is
37 and trace it back from 128, that is, we get to 91. We ﬁnally get for the
position of the three frequencies 4, 84, and 91, and those are the frequencies
we should ﬁnd in the graph of the Fourier transformation. However, we ﬁnd
5, 85, and 90. The ﬁrst two are folded twice, the last three times. We have not
taken into account that the Fourier transformation program starts at 0 and not
at 1.

9.2.6
High Resolution Spectroscopy
In high resolution spectroscopy one is often interested in investigating a nar-
row bandwidth of frequencies for high resolution. The sampling interval l in
the length domain is related to the highest frequency νM in the 1/length domain.
When increasing the number of points N in the length domain, one also increases
the number N of points in the frequency domain. Since the sampling interval
determines the frequency interval from 0 to νM, a higher number of points in the
length domain results in a higher number of points in the frequency domain. One
gets higher resolution in the interval from 0 to νM. The resolution is inverse pro-
portional to the total length L of the interferogram. The length may be expressed
as L  N l, and one has
Nl  L  1/(2(νM/N))
(9.64)
and obtains for νM/N
νM/N  @ν  1/2L.
(9.65)
A high resolution interferometer uses a large optical path difference L in order to
make @ν small. If we take, for example, L  50 cm, we have for @ν  (1/100)
cm−1 and for the resolving power R  νM/@ν at 100 microns (equal to 100
cm−1)
R  νM/@ν  100/(1/100)  10, 000.
(9.66)
The number of points in length space is equal to the number of frequency intervals
in frequency space, which is
N  100/(1/100)  10, 000
(9.67)
and is also equal to R. To record 10,000 points, assuming about 3 sec for each
point, would take 9 hours. The information we obtain in this way is a spectrum
from 1 to 100 cm−1 with resolution of 1/100 cm−1.
In the case where one is only interested in the study of a section of the spectrum
one may use folding of the spectrum. Let us assume that we are interested in
the section from 2/3 of 100 cm−1 to 100 cm−1. In that case we use a bandpass

356
9. FOURIER TRANSFORMATION AND FT-SPECTROSCOPY
FIGURE 9.2
We assume that a bandpass ﬁlter eliminates the spectrum from 1 to 66 cm−1. The
spectrum is folded by using a sampling interval of 3 times l, where l is the sampling interval,
corresponding to the highest frequency 100 cm−1; that is, 1  1/2 · 100 cm−1  0.005 cm  50
microns. The frequency scale for the sections changes the direction to the highest value for even
or odd factors of folding.
ﬁlter and eliminate all other frequencies, and fold the spectrum three times by
choosing a sample interval three times larger (see Figure 9.2). This is similar to
what we discussed above in FileFig 9.15, where we studied the folding of a sum
of cos-functions sampled with intervals 1/256, 2/256, and 4/256.
We have νM/3 for the width of the spectral sections to be studied with the
length L of the interferogram. Consequently, the sampling interval has the value
3 l  L/3333, instead of l  L/(10, 000). The total number of points is reduced
from 10,000 to 3333, but the length of the interferogram remains the same.
Therefore we obtain the same high resolution in a smaller spectral region with
one-third of the points. A very important fact is that we have to use the bandpass
ﬁlter we assumed to apply. The spectra of the two sections of 1 to 33 cm−1 and 33
cm−1 to 66 cm−1 are folded onto the spectrum of 66 cm−1 to 100 cm−1. If they
contain spectral information, the spectrum will be “messed up,” like the Fourier
transforms in FileFig 9.15. We obtain the same high resolution for a smaller part
of the spectrum, using a larger sampling interval and fewer points. In our case
the spectrum is obtained in one-third of the time.
In Figure 9.3 we show the background spectrum, taken with a Michelson inter-
ferometer and a bandpass ﬁlter. The bandpass has to have a width of νM/integer.

spectrometer: applications to H2O, NH3, and NO2 lines. Applied Optics, 15, 1976, p 708–713.)
In Figure 9.4 we show a high-resolution spectrum of water in the 104 to 107
cm−1 region, obtained with a sampling interval six times larger and in a time
span six times shorter. We state the procedure in more general terms as follows. A
ﬁlter is used to eliminate all parts of the spectrum with frequencies higher than
νM and lower than νm, where m stands for minimum. The value of νm has to be
chosen in such a way that q  νM/(νM −νm) is an integer. We then obtain with
N sample intervals, each calculated by using
l  1/{2(νM −νm)},

has a ﬁnite summation range, instead of the inﬁnite large integration range. In
the section on Fourier transformation, we reduced the integration range for the
Fourier transformation of the slit from −∞to ∞to a range from −a to a. We
did this because the width of the slit is 2a, and outside the interval from −a to a
there is no information. We may multiply the interferogram function S(y) in the
integral of Eq. (9.70) with a step function p(y), which is 1 in the interval from
−a to a and otherwise zero. We introduce into Eq. (9.70) the step function p(y),

(9.73)
From the point of view of calculating a Fourier transformation over a limited
range of space, Eq. (9.73) is similar to the discrete Fourier transformation of
Eq. (9.71). In FileFig 9.17 we discuss an example of the Fourier transfor-
mation of a cos-function integrated over a ﬁnite range. We use the function
yk  cos(2πf k/255), with frequency f  31, plotted over a range of k  0 to
400 and do the multiplication with a step function pk of width 256 points. The
result of the real Fourier transformation is that we obtain a peak at f  31, not
inﬁnitely narrow and with a loop extending to negative values. Since negative
intensities do not appear in spectroscopy, it is desirable to ﬁnd a procedure to
avoid this artifact. The situation can be corrected by using in place of pk, which

9.2. FOURIER TRANSFORM SPECTROSCOPY

is a step function, the function qk, which is a triangular function, deﬁned as
qk  1 −k/255.
(9.74)
The multiplication of yk by qk and their Fourier transformation is shown in
FileFig 9.16. The function yk decreases to 0, and remains 0 in the range of
integration, which was set to zero when changing from the inﬁnite range of
integration to the ﬁnite range. Application of the Fourier transformation shows
that the negative values of the frequency spectrum have disappeared. This is
called apodization. A drawback to this process is that the resolution is reduced
by a factor of about 2.

Asymmetric Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
We have discussed the use of the Michelson interferometer for spectroscopy. The
sample was assumed to be positioned either before the light was divided at the
beam splitter or after the light was recombined. The reﬂection and transmission
properties of the two arms of the interferometer were assumed to be equal and
the only asymmetry was the difference in the path. To calculate the spectrum we
could use the “real” Fourier transformation.
We now assume that the sample is at the surface of one of the mirrors of
the Michelson interferometer. The reﬂection properties of the two arms of the
interferometer are then different and the complex Fourier transformation must
be applied. As a result of using the complex Fourier transformation one has
more information available (complex numbers instead of real numbers). We
may calculate not only the intensity (square of amplitude) but also obtain phase
information. If in the case of reﬂection for a certain frequency range, the reﬂected
amplitude and the phase change at reﬂection are known, the optical constants n
and K may be calculated. We start with Eqs. (9.34) and (9.35), describing the
two beams reﬂected from the two mirrors in the Michelson interferometer. We
assume that the light is reﬂected in the ﬁxed arm by a mirror producing the same
magnitude of the amplitude and a phase shift of π. Using complex notation we

have
u1  A(exp iπ) exp i{2π(x1/λ −t/T )}.
(A9.1)
The sample is assumed to be on the mirror in the movable arm of the interfer-
ometer, and we assume an amplitude reﬂection coefﬁcient r and a phase change
ϕ. We call y the displacement from the equal path length position and have
u2  A(r exp iϕ) exp i{2π({x1 + y}/λ −t/T )}.
(A9.2)
Superposition of the two waves gives us
u  u1 + u2
 A{r exp iϕ + exp i{2πy/λ + (π)} exp i{2π(x1/λ −t/T )}
(A9.3)
and for uu∗we calculate

be written as (ϕ −π). The sign is of no importance. We can then factor out

(as done above in Section 2.3).

transformations of the sample and background interferogram we have
r(ν) exp ϕ(ν)  {P(ν) −iQ(ν)}/{PB(ν) −iQB(ν)}.
(A9.14)
For the intensity reﬂection coefﬁcient r2 we then get
r2  {P(ν)2 + Q(ν)2}/{PB(ν)2 + QB(ν)2}.

and

where the sign of ϕ, that is, its relation to 2π, has to be chosen.
The optical constants are obtained by using Fresnel’s formulas for normal

Using Wave Theory
10.1
INTRODUCTION
In geometrical optics we used the thin lens equation to ﬁnd the image point of
an object point when using a thin lens of focal length f . Using wave theory we
assume that Huygens’ wavelets emerge from each point of the object and travel
to the lens. The lens produces the diffraction pattern of the object in its focal
plane, which may be seen as the Fourier transformation of the object pattern.
The lens also produces the image of the object by refraction. A second Fourier
transformation performed on the diffraction pattern results in a pattern having
the shape of the object. Since the light travels forward, we associate it with the
image. This is schematically shown in Figure 10.1.
The model we use for the description of image formation by a lens is, that
one Fourier transformation is applied to the object pattern to obtain the diffrac-
tion pattern of the object and a second Fourier transformation is applied to the
diffraction pattern to obtain the image pattern. Since we found that the Fourier
transform of a Fourier transform is the original, but know that experimentally
the image is not exactly the same as the object, we may ask the question, “Where
is the perturbation entering the process?” It has been one of the great discoveries
of optics (E. Abbe in Born and Wolf, 1964, xxi) that any perturbation of the
diffraction pattern modiﬁes the image. In Figure 10.2 we show how changes in
the diffraction pattern, such as blocking off certain parts, change the image. We
may also introduce phase shifts at some spots and not at others and obtain an
image with much stronger contrast (F. Zernicke in Born and Wolf, 1964, xxi).

SPATIAL WAVES AND BLACKENING CURVES,
SPATIAL FREQUENCIES, AND FOURIER
TRANSFORMATION
Using scalar diffraction theory, the Kirchhoff–Fresnel integral uses monochro-
matic light to describe the diffraction pattern of the light emerging from the
object. A lens is used in Fraunhofer diffraction to have the diffraction pattern
observed in the focal plane of the lens. This same integral may be written as a
Fourier transform integral, as done in Chapter 3 for the diffraction on a slit. The
coordinates of the object, the slit, are length coordinates in the length domain.
The coordinates of the Fourier transformation, the diffraction pattern of the slit,
are coordinates in the spatial frequency domain and have 1/length dimensions.
We note that we deal with an amplitude diffraction pattern in the frequency do-
main, which contains phase information, even if we started with a real function
in the object plane. After one applies a second Fourier transformation on the
diffraction pattern (in the spatial frequency domain), the result is a geometrical
image pattern similar to the original object and appearing in the space domain.
In our model description we use the ﬁrst Fourier transformation from the geo-
metrical space domain into the spatial frequency domain. The object is described
by geometrical spatial waves and the Fourier transformation describes the fre-

quency spectrum of these spatial waves. The object function h(y) is interpreted
as a superposition of spatial waves and the result of the superposition is recorded
as the blackening of a photographic plate. The maxima of a spatial wave corre-
sponds to black, the minima corresponds to white, and the gray level indicates
zero. By doing so, we attribute phase information to these waves. Superposition
of a black maxima (+A) and a white minima (−A) results in gray (0). In the
section on holography, we present more details on the presentation of phase in-
formation with the black, white, and gray of the photographic plate. In FileFig
10.1 we show this concept in mathematical terms, considering the Fourier series

OBJECT, IMAGE, AND THE TWO FOURIER
TRANSFORMATIONS
10.3.1
Waves from Object and Aperture Plane and Lens
In geometrical optics, we employed the thin lens equation to ﬁnd the image point
xi of an object point x0, when using a thin lens of focal length f . The image
of an extended object was obtained by imaging each point of the object to its
conjugate point at the image.
The application of wave theory to the image forming process is also done in
a point-by-point procedure. The image points are in the y, z plane, and at the
distance x a lens is positioned; the ﬁnite aperture of the lens is described in the

η, ζ plane. At distance X from the lens is the image plane and the image is
described in that plane by Y, Z coordinates (see Figure 10.3).1
We assume monochromatic light and consider two summation processes and
the action of the lens. The action of the lens was discussed in Chapter 3 for the
case of Fraunhofer observation. The aperture of the lens is described by α(η, ζ),
and the changes of the incident wavefront to the wavefront leaving the lens is
given by exp(−ik(η2+ζ 2)/2f ). The lens bends the wavefront in such a way that
it converges to the focal point. The phase factor may be written as eikρ where ρ is
in the direction of propagation. We obtain ρ  η2/2f and as a result eikρ is equal
to exp(ikη2/2f ). For simplicity, without losing essential points of importance,
we restrict our discussions to a one-dimensional extension of object, lens, and
image.
10.3.2
Summation Processes
10.3.2.1
The First Summation Process
The magnitude of the object points is described by h(y, z) and from each point a
spherical wave emerges, described by h(y, z)eikr/r. All the waves are summed
up for each point η, ζ in the plane of the lens. In the following we restrict the
considerations to one dimension.
We call h(y) the magnitude of each object point and calculate r in eikr/r in
terms of x, y, and η (see Figure 10.4)
r2  (η −y)2 + x2  η2 −2ηy + y2 + x2  R2 + η2 −2ηy
(10.2)
 R2(1 + (η2 −2ηy)/R2),
where we call y2 + x2  R2 and we consider R2 as a constant because y ≪x.
Developing the square root of [R2(1 + (η2 −2ηy)/R2)] yields
r ≈R{1 + (η2 −2ηy)/2R2} ≈R −ηy/R + η2/2R.

The aperture is presented by α(η) and from the chapter on diffraction we know
that the wavefront is changed by a phase factor of exp(−ikη2/2f ).

Second Summation Process
From each point in the plane η, ζ emerges a spherical wave α(η, ζ)eiks/s. These
amplitudes, including the phase factor introduced by the lens, are summed up
for all ﬁnal image points X, Y.
In a similar way as discussed in Section 10.3.2.1 we may write approximately

The Pair of Fourier Transformations
10.3.3.1
Aperture Function α(η) of the Lens Is a Constant
When α(η) is independent of η we can include it in the constant before the
integral and have
g(Y)  C
 
h(y) exp{−ikηy/x0}dy

exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.9)
The integration over y produces a function of η and we call the integral in brackets
ω(η)
ω(η) 

h(y) exp{−ikηy/x0}dy
(10.10)
and write
g(Y)  C

ω(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.11)
The result is: The image amplitude function g(Y) is the Fourier transform of
the Fourier transform of the object amplitude function h(y).
Since the Fourier transform of the Fourier transform is the original function,
except for a scaling factor, for this idealized case the result is that the function
representing the image is the same as the function representing the object, except
for a scaling factor and phase factor.
10.3.3.2
Aperture Function α(η) of the Lens Is Not a Constant
When α(η) is not a constant, we may write, using ω(η),
g(Y)  C

ω(η)α(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.12)
We have as the result: The Fourier transform of the modiﬁed Fourier transform
of the object function is the image function. The function α(η) is in most cases
an aperture function such as a step function or in two dimensions a function
representing a round hole. In that case only the magnitude in the η direction
(in two dimensions, the η, ζ plane) is altered. However, α(η) may also contain
a phase factor representing phase differences between certain points (η) in the
plane (η, ζ).

IMAGE FORMATION USING INCOHERENT
LIGHT
10.4.1
Spread Function
We have assumed in the preceding chapters that monochromatic light was used
for image formation. We now want to use nonmonochromatic light, (e.g., light
from the sun) for image formation. To do this we will assume that there is
no ﬁxed phase relation between the light emitted from a pair of object points.
Since we want to use only one medium wavelength, the light we assume using
is called quasimonochromatic light (see Chapter 4). The case where one uses
monochromatic light is discussed in Section 10.5. As in geometrical optics, we
consider the object made of points and apply a point-by-point process to obtain
the image. The detector used for recording the image will be sensitive to the
intensity at each image point, which we assume to be proportional to the square
of the amplitude.
When considering one point, we have to replace h(y) (see Section 10.4.2) by
a delta function and have from Eq. (10.8),
s(Y)  C

[

δ(y) exp{−ikηy/x0}dy]α(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.13)
Since

δ(y) exp{−ikηy/x0}dy  1
(10.14)
we get
s(Y)  C

α(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.15)
If α(η) is a constant and s(Y) is a delta function equal to the object function h(y)
we have a point-to-point imaging process. In general, if α(η) is not a constant we
go back to the ﬁrst summation process and ﬁnd for the two-dimensional process
that α(η, ζ) describes the amplitude distribution of the light from the point source
in the plane of the lens. Therefore s(Y) describes the deviation from a point we
would have obtained as the image point.
For the image one needs the intensity and has to square Eq. (10.15) and obtain
S(Y)  |C

α(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη|2.
(10.16)
We call S(Y) the spread function. This is the spread of the object point in the
image plane as produced by the lens.

10.4.2
The Convolution Integral
The integral in Eq. eq10.15 may be rewritten using the convolution theorem of
Fouriertransformations.ThistheoremtellsusthatwemaywritetheFouriertrans-
form of a product of two functions, here ω(η)α(η), as the convolution integral
of the Fourier transformation of ω(η) and of α(η).
We consider the integral in Eq. (10.12),
g(Y)  C

ω(η)α(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.17)
From Eq. (10.10) we have
ω(η) 

h(y) exp{−ikηy/x0}dy.
(10.18)
The Fourier transform is the original object function
h(Y)  C

ω(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη.
(10.19)
From Eq. (10.15) we have
s(Y)  C

α(η) exp{−ikηY/xi}dη
(10.20)
and may replace g(Y) in Eq. (10.17) by the convolution integral
g(Y)  C

h(Y)s(τ −Y)dτ.
(10.21)
The effect of the aperture function α(η) is that the ﬁnal image function is obtained
by convolving the original object function h(Y) with the Fourier transform of
the aperture function α(η), which is s(Y) (using image coordinates).
The result is that only the coordinates of the image plane are involved.
10.4.3
Impulse Response and the Intensity Pattern
If the object is described by Iob(Y), a point of the object on the object screen can
be represented by the product Iob(Y) times a δ function
Iob(Y)δ(Y −Y ′),
(10.22)
which will have the value Iob(Y ′) for Y  Y ′.
For a very large aperture, nothing would happen to the δ function and we
would have on the observation screen a point. The image point is similar to the
object point but we may have to introduce a scaling factor. For a small aperture,
the point would spread to a certain pattern and we would have to replace δ(Y −Y ′)
by the spread function S(Y −Y ′). The spread function describes the change of
the object as it appears on the observation screen. The distortion is produced by

380
10. IMAGING USING WAVE THEORY
the lens.
Iob(Y)δ(Y −Y ′) −→Iob(Y)S(Y −Y ′).
(10.23)
If the object is only one point we call this the impulse response. For incoherent
light, the spread function is the image of one point on the object screen. If a
second point is added on the object screen, it has to be treated similarly and
independently and the result has to be added to the image plane. For n points we
have for the impulse response
Iim(Y) 

Iob(Yn)S(Y −Yn)
(10.24)
and for a continuous distribution of points we obtain
Iim(Y) 

Iob(Y ′)S(Y −Y ′)dY ′.
(10.25)
With Eq. (10.25) one is able to calculate the image from an object when the
spread function is known. This is demonstrated in the following for a few simple
examples.
10.4.4
Examples of Convolution with Spread Function
10.4.4.1
One Bar as an Object and Application of a Cylindrical Lens
We assume that the object is made of just one bar, represented by h(y) as a
rectangular pulse of height 1 and width from y  b1 to y  b2. The lens is a
cylindrical lens represented as a pulse by the function α(η) of height 1 and width
from η  −a to η  +a (see FileFig 10.3). We call the focal length of the lens
f and its diameter 2a. One calls f/2a the f # of the lens.
The spread, which is produced by the lens, is presented by the spread function
S(Y) (Eq. (10.16)) where we have set X  f , with f being the focal length of
the lens
S(Y)  |

{(e−ikYη/f )}dη|2.
(10.26)
For a cylindrical lens we have to integrate over −a to a and get
S(Y)  4a2{(sin kaY/f )/(kaY/f )}2.
(10.27)
The image is then obtained from the convolution integral

with γ  0.0005 mm, diameter of the lens 2a, and choice of f #  10. The
width of the object bar has been assumed to be from b1  −0.002 to b2  0.002.

1. Change the values of b1, b2, and a so that b2 −b1 is larger than a.
2. Change the values of b1, b2, and a so that b2 −b1 is smaller than a.
10.4.4.2
Two Bars
Two bars are considered in FileFig 10.4, each of width 0.003, and center-to-center
distance of bb  0.013. The lens has width 2a, and we use for the wavelength
λ  0.0005 mm and for the f #  10. The image of each bar is calculated
separately with the integral of Eq. (10.28). Because of the linearity of the system
the ﬁnal image is the superposition of the result of imaging of each bar separately.

1. Change the distance between the two object bars and study the resolution. If
the distance is too small, the image is just one peak.
2. Change the calculation and apply the spread function to the total image over
a large range of integration. The image is now more similar to the object.
10.4.4.3
One Round Object and a Circular Lens
In far ﬁeld diffraction of the round aperture, one ﬁnds that the two-dimensional
problem is reduced to a one-dimensional circular symmetric problem, solved by
using the Bessel function. We may similarly proceed for imaging. The object
is a round aperture of diameter 2b  0.004 (FileFig 10.5). The round lens
has the diameter 2a. For the calculation of the integral, corresponding to the
integral of Eq. (10.28), we extend the deﬁnition of the radius as it appears in the

382
10. IMAGING USING WAVE THEORY
Bessel function to negative values. The spread function is calculated using the
nonnormalized Bessel function
s2(R)  4a2{J1(2πaR/λf )/(2πaR/λf )}2.
(10.29)
One has to simply replace the sin y/y function by the J1(y′)/y′ function. We
use for R again Y and for R′ the integration variable Y ′. For the integral we then
have

10.4.5
Transfer Function
10.4.5.1
Transfer Function and Fourier Transformation
The spread function is used in the coordinate space of the image to calculate
how the object appears on the observation screen (image coordinates). If the
lens did not alter the object we would observe a perfect image of the object. The
image was obtained by convolution of the object function Iob(Y ′) with the spread
function S(Y −Y ′), both using image space coordinates
Iim(Y) 

Iob(Y ′)S(Y −Y ′)dY ′.
(10.32)
From the convolution theorem we know that the integral in Eq. (10.32) expresses
the Fourier transform of the product of the Fourier transform of Iob(Y) and the
Fourier transform of S(Y). If we call these Fourier transforms
ω(µ) 

Iob(Y ′)e−i2πµY ′dY ′
(10.33)
and
τ(µ) 

S(Y ′)e−i2πµY ′dY ′,
(10.34)
one may write Eq. (10.32) as
Iim(Y)  C

ω(µ)τ(µ)ei2πµYdµ,
(10.35)

10.4. IMAGE FORMATION USING INCOHERENT LIGHT
385
where C contains all constants.
The Fourier transform of S(Y ′), which is τ(µ), is called the (unnormalized)
transfer function. Equation (10.35) tells us that the Fourier transform of Iim(Y),
which we call φim(µ), is equal to the product of the Fourier transforms ω(µ)τ(µ),
which is
φim  ω(µ)τ(µ).
(10.36)
For the coordinates we have 1/Y  µ, where µ may be interpreted as the spatial
frequency in the frequency domain. The transfer function operates in the spatial
frequency domain.
In FileFig 10.7 we calculate the Fourier transform of an object, which is a
rectangular pulse, and the Fourier transform of a spread function for a cylindrical
lens (transfer function). Then we multiply the Fourier transform of the object
with the transfer function and perform the Fourier transformation of the product.
The resulting image should look like a rectangular pulse.

Examples
Fourier Transform of (sin x/x)2 as Transfer Function
Wetakeasanobjectagridpresentedasaseriesofsquarepulses(FileFig10.8)and
calculate and perform the Fourier transformation ωob(µ). The spread function
for a cylindrical lens is (Eq. (10.27)),
S(X)  4a2{sin(πX/λf #)/(πX/λf #)}2,
(10.37)
where we use f #  f/2a for X (the space coordinate) i/255 and i is the running
number of the Fourier transformation from 1 to 256 (0-255). We have to use here
i/255 in the frequency domain since we used i in the space domain. The Fourier
transform of S(X) is τ(µ). The product of φ(µ)  ωob(µ)τ(µ) is shown in
FileFig 10.8, and the Fourier transform (inverse) of φ(µ) is the ﬁnal image. In
FileFig 10.8 we have used the complex Fourier transform of 256 points for the
object and its mirror image. We should remember that the longest wavelength
of the spatial waves is 128, and the corresponding smallest frequency 1/128. We

386
10. IMAGING USING WAVE THEORY
also use the scale 1/256 in the transfer function and have the smallest frequency at
1/128. The wavelength is 0.0005 mm and the f #  f/2a which is 10. Changing
the f # in FileFig 10.8 will change the triangle corresponding to τi and will admit
more or fewer spatial frequencies for image formation.

Application 10.8. Change the f # and observe through the changing triangle
that more or fewer frequencies are used for image formation.
Fourier Transformation of the Bessel Function as Transfer Function
We may use as the transfer function (J1(y)/y)2 corresponding to a circular
lens instead of (sin y/y)2, which corresponds to a cylindrical lens. Keeping the
argument of the transfer function the same but taking R instead of X we use
J1(πR/λfn)/(πR/λfn),
(10.38)
where f n is the f -number. The variable R is replaced by i/255 and i is the
running number of the Fourier transformation, from 1 to 256 (0–255). We have
to use here i/255 in the frequency domain, since we used i in the space domain. In
FileFig 10.9 the object is a grid presented as a series of square pulses in the space
domain,butthespreadfunctionisnow(J1(y)/y)2,anditsFouriertransformation

in FileFig 10.9. The Fourier transform (inverse) of φ(µ)  ω(ob)(µ)τ(µ) is the
ﬁnal image.
Changing the f # in FileFig 10.9 will change τk as shown and will admit more
or fewer spatial frequencies for image formation.

Application 10.9. Change the f # and observe through the changing transfer
function that more or fewer frequencies are used for image formation.
10.4.6
Resolution
The Rayleigh criterion of resolution states that two image peaks are considered
resolved if the maximum of the diffraction pattern of one is at the position of the
ﬁrst minimum of the other. This is demonstrated in FileFig 10.10. We consider
two round objects and a round lens, and apply the Rayleigh criterion. The object
is made of two “rectangles” of width b1 - b2 and b3 - b4 (FileFig 10.11). The
aperture of the lens of diameter 2a forms a diffraction pattern of each point on
the image screen.
The argument of the Bessel function 2πaR/λf is again written as
πR/λ(f/2a)  πR/λ(f #),
(10.39)
where f #  f/2a, and we use Y for R in FileFig 10.11. The ﬁrst zero of the
Bessel function J1(πR′/λf #) is at πR′/λf #  3.83. Therefore if the maximum
of one peak is at the minimum of the other, the distance 2b′ is (3.83/π)λf # 
1.22λf #. In our example in FileFig 10.11 we have used the diameter 0.0005 mm
for the round objects, which is the same as the wavelength. The f # is equal to
10 and the product λf # has a value 0.005. The center-to-center distance of the
two objects is 0.0061. In FileFig 10.11 we show the image of the two objects at
the minimum distance corresponding to the resolution according to the Rayleigh
criterion.

Spread Function
We assumed in Section 10.4 that incoherent light is used for image formation.
We now discuss the image formation process using coherent light and show
that the spread function must be changed. The general process is the same as
in Section 10.4. Coherent radiation is now assumed to emerge from an object.
Using Huygens’ principle in the ﬁrst process, the wavelets emerging from the
object are summed and travel to the lens. In the second process, the wavelets
emerging from the lens are summed. Taking the action of the lens into account

where the constant C before the integral takes care of all constant factors. Simi-
larly to the way we proceeded for the incoherent case, we use a δ function for a
point in the object plane. Substituting for h(y) a delta function into Eq. (10.40)
one obtains for the ﬁrst Fourier transformation


and then has for the remaining part of the integral of Eq. (10.8),

(10.42)
Equation (10.42) is the spread function s(Y) for the case of coherent light. For the
image formation we again use a convolution integral, similar to the incoherent
case (see Eq. (10.21)) where h(Y) describes the object. But unlike Eq. (10.21),
we use the spread function s(Y), containing phase information. The convolution
integral

h(Y ′)s(Y −Y ′)dY ′

has to be squared for the description of the image
Iim(Y)  |C

h(Y ′)s(Y −Y ′)dY ′|2.
(10.44)
In contrast to the incoherent case, we have to use s(Y) for the spread function
instead of S(Y), which is s(Y)2. The spread function is ﬁrst convolved with all
points of the object and then we have to square the integral to get the image.
10.5.2
Resolution
As an example we discuss the problem of resolution. We consider two round ob-
jects of diameter 0.0005 mm, as we did for the incoherent case, and a wavelength
of 0.0005 mm and a f #  10. The distance to be determined should be such
that the ﬁnal image looks similar to the image of the two objects as we found
for the incoherent case, when applying the Rayleigh criterion. The calculation
is presented in FileFig 10.12.
The image is calculated from the convolution integrals, where we call h(Y)
here iob(Y) and omit the constants before the integral,

10. IMAGING USING WAVE THEORY
We use for s(Y) the Bessel function similar to Eq. (10.38). The intensity of the
image is obtained by squaring the result of the integration (note that s(Y −Y ′)
contains phase information).
The distance of the two peaks in the ﬁnal image of the two objects for the
coherent case is at a center-to-center distance of 0.0082. This is larger than for
the incoherent case. The ﬁnal image is shown for the same distance as used for
the incoherent case, and one observes that the two peaks are not resolved. Since
the distance used in the coherent case is larger than the one for the incoherent
case, for a comparable set of parameters, we have the result: Better resolution is
obtained by using incoherent light.

Transfer Function
We proceed much as we did in the incoherent case and call
ω(µ) 

iob(Y ′)e−i2πµY ′dY ′
(10.46)
and
˜τ(µ) 

s(Y ′)e−i2πµY ′dY ′,
(10.47)
where ˜τ(µ) is the transfer function in the coherent case. The difference in
Eq. (10.47) with respect to Eq. (10.34) is that s(Y ′) is an amplitude function
that carries phase information. The image is obtained by a Fourier transforma-
tion, similar to Eq. (10.35) for the incoherent case. To obtain the description of the
intensity of the image, the result has to be squared. We have for the coherent case
Iim(Y)  |C

ω(µ)˜τ(µ)ei2πµYdµ|2.
(10.48)
We call φim(µ) the Fourier transformation of Iim(Y) and get
Iim(Y)  {FT of the product of the FT of Iob and FT ofs}2.
(10.49)
In the frequency domain we have, similar to Eq. (10.36),
φim(µ)  {ω(µ)˜τ(µ)}.
(10.50)
Comparing (10.50) with (10.36) one sees that a symmetric blocking function
that does not carry phase information has the same effect of eliminating certain
spatial frequencies for the incoherent and coherent cases.

394
10. IMAGING USING WAVE THEORY
As examples we consider the imaging of a periodic structure using the spread
functions (sin y/y) and (J1(y)/y). For the coherent case we use in FileFig 10.13
the spread function (sin y/y) in comparison to the incoherent case of FileFig 10.8
where we used (sin y/y)2. In FileFig 10.14 the spread function (J1(y)/y) is used
in comparison to FileFig 10.9 where we used (J1(y)/y)2. For the coherent case
the spread functions are not squared. The ﬁnal image has to be the square of
the last Fourier transformation (see Eq. (10.48)). In comparison one sees that
the transfer function (i.e., τ) eliminates in the incoherent case higher spatial
frequencies in a linear way and in the coherent case in a steplike fashion.
The transfer function τ in FileFig 10.13 is a pulse function and may be inter-
preted as a blocking function, eliminating parts of the diffraction pattern of the
object. Similar action was taken in Figure 10.2 on the diffraction pattern in order
to change the image.

Introduction
When discussing the imaging process for coherent light, the ﬁrst Fourier trans-
formation produced the diffraction pattern of the object. The result of the ﬁrst
Fourier transformation contained phase information, regardless of whether the
object was a real or complex function. The second Fourier transformation needed
this phase information to produce the image of the object. To ﬁx the phase infor-
mation on a photographic plate we follow closely the discussion in Goodmann,
1988, p.198.
10.6.2
Recording of the Interferogram
In holography one uses a photographic ﬁlm to record the amplitude and phase
information necessary for the reconstruction of the image of an object. This
is done by interference of the coherent light, scattered from the object with a
coherent reference beam (Figure 10.5).
The light scattered by the object is described by the complex amplitude func-
tion a  a0e−iφ, where a0 is a function of y, z and φ a function of x, y, z. The
reference wave is described by the complex amplitude function A  A0e−iψ,
FIGURE 10.5
Production of a hologram. The interference pattern, produced by the waves of the
scattered light a of the object and the light of a reference beam A, is recorded on a photographic
ﬁlm, called the hologram.

where A0 is a constant and ψ contains the coordinates describing the direction
of incidence and propagation with respect to the photographic ﬁlm.
The intensity pattern of the interference of A and a is

(10.51)
The interference pattern is recorded on the photographic ﬁlm and after develop-
mentthephaseinformationiscontainedintheproﬁleofthedensityofblackening.
The relation between the intensity of the light incident on a spot of the ﬁlm and
the resulting blackening is logarithmic. A detailed discussion of the resulting
transmission t of the ﬁlm, which is called a hologram, is presented in Goodmans
(1988). Under certain circumstances one can describe the transmission curve in
a linear way and have
tﬁlm  cA2
0 + β′a2
0 + β′A0a0e−iφeiψ + β′A0a0eiφeiψ
(10.52)
where c and β′ are constants. The third and fourth terms are each complex.
However, together they are real and therefore tﬁlm remains real.
10.6.3
Recovery of Image with Same Plane Wave Used for
Recording
10.6.3.1
Virtual Image
We illuminate the hologram with a plane wave equal to the one used for the
recording of the hologram. We use in Eq. (10.53) A0e−iψ and in Eq. (10.54) the
conjugate A0ei9 and have
A0e−iψtﬁlm A0e−iψ(cA2
0+β′a2
0+β′A0a0e−iφeiψ +β′A0a0e+iφe−iψ) (10.53)

0+β′a2
0+β′A0a0e−iφeiψ +β′A0a0e+iφe−iψ). (10.54)
The ﬁrst term in Eqs. (10.53) and (10.54) is a constant term; the second may be
neglected if we assume that a0 is small compared to A. The third term in (10.53)
is
A0e−iψβ′A0a0e−iφeiψ  (β′A2
0)a0e−iφ.
(10.55)
This is the important term for the virtual image. It is the doublet of the wavefront
of the original and diverges. In Figure 10.6a. we show the recovery of the image
using the beam A. As we know from geometrical optics, the diverging light is
traced back to a virtual image of the object.

and is the duplication of the conjugate of the wavefront of the original. In Fig-
ure 10.6b we show the illumination by the beam A∗and the convergence to the
real image, which is in the opposite direction to the virtual image we discussed
in Section 10.6.3.1.
10.6.4
Recovery Using a Different Plane Wave
If we produce the hologram with a plane wave of amplitude A and illuminate
the hologram with a plane wave of amplitude B, all in the same (horizontal)
direction, we get
B0tﬁlm  cB0A2
0 + dB0a2
0 + β′B0A0a0e−iφ + β′B0A0a0eiφ.
(10.57)
The real and virtual image now both appear in the horizontal direction (see
Figure 10.7).
10.6.5
Production of Real and Virtual Image Under an Angle
To see the virtual image separately from the real image, one has to use a reference
wave under an angle with respect to the normal of the object, around which the
scattered light emerges. To do this, we use for A the wave A0e−i2π sin θ(x/λ) and
have for the transparency of the ﬁlm
tﬁlm  cA2
0 + β′a2
0 + β′A0a0e−iφei2π sin θ(x/λ)

10. IMAGING USING WAVE THEORY
FIGURE 10.7
Real and virtual image appear in one direction, the direction of view.
For recovery we illuminate with a plane wave of amplitude B. Going through
the same discussion as presented above, we get for the third (Eq. (10.59)) and
fourth terms (Eq. (10.59)a)
(β′A2
0)a0e−iφe+i2π sin θ(x/λ)
(10.59a)
and
(β′A2
0)a0eiφe−i2π sin θ(x/λ).
(10.59b)
The virtual image Eq. (10.59a) is now (after tracing backwards) in the direction
of θ. The real image is in the direction of −θ and that is different from the
direction we seek for the virtual image. This is shown in Figure 10.8, where
virtual and real images are separated.
10.6.6
Size of Hologram
In the discussion of imaging we found that for a special case using coherent
light the image can be calculated from the Fourier transform of the Fourier
transform of the object. The hologram may be compared, in a simpliﬁed way,
FIGURE 10.8
The incident light is from the left and directly transmitted light continues to the
right. The direction of view is at the angle θ, and the virtual image is traced back in that direction.
The real image appears on the right at the angle −θ.

with the diffraction pattern of the object. It contains the spatial frequency spec-
trum including phase information. We may then substitute for the hologram the
Fourier transform of the object and obtain the image is by a second Fourier
transformation.
Using this simple model we can easily demonstrate that the object can be
reconstructed using different sizes of the hologram. Smaller physical sizes will
give us more deteriorated images of the object. By cutting a large hologram into
small ones, we lose spatial frequency information. For simplicity we consider an
object with the ﬁrst Fourier transformation in such a way that the smallest fre-
quencies are in the center and the largest frequencies at increased distances from
the center. To demonstrate the effect of the removal of frequencies we consider
the example of a grid as an object. Removing certain sections of the frequency
pattern, which is accomplished with the ﬁrst Fourier transformation, will change
the image. In FileFig 10.15 we use a blocking function for a low frequency
portion, in FileFig 10.16 a blocking function for an intermediate section, and in
FileFig 10.17 a blocking function of a grid. In FileFig 10.18 we simulate cutting
down the hologram by a blocking function, which symmetrically cuts down the
lowest frequencies.

11.1
INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1 on Geometrical Optics we discussed geometrical image formation
by using paraxial theory. The essential assumption of paraxial theory is that
the angles between an emerging ray from the object and the axis of the system
are small. In general small means that one could replace sin α by the angle α
(in radians). When this assumption can not be made, one obtains a distorted
image. There are elaborate computational programs available for lens design,
including systematic corrections for the various types of aberrations. To give
an introduction to the most commonly known monochromatic aberrations, we
discuss spherical aberration of a single refracting surface and a thin lens, and
coma, and astigmatism of a spherical surface and a thin lens. At the end we also
discuss chromatic aberration.
11.2
SPHERICAL ABERRATION OF A SINGLE
REFRACTING SURFACE
In Figure 11.1, two rays are shown from the object point P1 to the spherical
surface. After refraction one ray is connected to the image point P2, the other to
P ′
2. When paraxial theory can not be used, the ray with the larger angle α2 has
the image point P ′
2 closer to the refracting surface. The difference between the
pointsP2 andP ′
2 iscalledthelongitudinalsphericalaberration.Foritsderivation,
we look at Figure 11.2 and derive the relations for image formation at one

spherical aberration of a surface of radius of curvature ρ.
The longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA) is deﬁned as xi1−xi1sal, which is
the difference of the image positions calculated for the paraxial and the spherical
aberration cases. In FileFig 11.1, we study the LSA for an object distance, which
corresponds to a real image, and two different refractive indices. In FileFig 11.2,
we study the dependence of LSA on object distances, which corresponds to real
images, and on the refractive index and the radius of curvature. For real images
spherical aberration may not be eliminated.

LONGITUDINAL AND LATERAL SPHERICAL
ABERRATION OF A THIN LENS
In Figure 11.3 spherical aberrations are shown for a positive and a negative thin
lens. To calculate the LSA  xi1 −xsph for a thin lens we use twice the result
obtained for a single spherical surface, as discussed in Section 11.2. There we
calculated for a spherical surface with refractive index n, the position xi1sal (see
Eq. (11.14)). The light entered from the medium of index 1 and traveled into the
medium of index n. We obtained
−1/x0 + n/xi
(11.15)
 (n −1)/r1 + ((n −1)/n2)(1/r1 −1/x0)2(1/r1 −(n + 1)/x0)[ρ2/2].
This result may be used to get a similar expression for light incident on the second
surface traveling from the medium with index n into the medium of index 1. We
substitute x0 with →xii and xi with →x00 and obtain
−n/x00 + 1/xii

Addition of Eqs. (11.15) and (11.16) will eliminate the terms n/xi and −n/x00,
and results in

To calculate xii one uses the paraxial equation of the thin lens
1/xii  1/x0 + (n −1)(1/r1 −1/r2),
(11.18)
where
1/f  (n −1)(1/r1 −1/r2)
(11.19)
and ﬁnally we have

(11.20)

The longitudinal spherical aberration of a thin lens is deﬁned as LSA  xii −
xiisph. We call the right side of Eq. (11.20) the reciprocal focal length for the

11. ABERRATION
spherical aberration case, 1/ff (x0), where ff (x0) is the focal length of the case
of spherical aberration. The result is
−1/x0 + 1/xiisph  1/ff (x0)
(11.21)
with
ff (x0)  1/{1/f + {(n −1)/n2}[ρ2/2]{a(x0) −b(x0)c(x0)}}
(11.22)
and the abbreviations

In Figure 11.4 we deﬁne the lateral spherical aberration as LAT  LSA times

ration and calculate numerical values of LSA and LAT for a choice of parameters
of n, r1, r2, ρ, and object distance x0. The elimination of spherical aberration is
further discussed in the next section using the π–σ equation.

11.4. THE π–σ EQUATION AND SPHERICAL ABERRATION
411
Application 11.3.
1. Use different values of n and observe that spherical aberration may not be
eliminated for real objects and images.
2. Assume x0 values for virtual images and ﬁnd positive and negative values for
the LSA. Therefore, for this case, spherical aberration may be eliminated.
11.4
THE π–σ EQUATION AND SPHERICAL
ABERRATION
We now study whether spherical aberration can be removed when using a special
choice of parameters. We introduce the parameters π (position factor) and σ
(shape factor),
π  (xii + x0)/(xii −x0)
and
σ  (r2 + r1)/(r2 −r1).
(11.24)
Using Eqs. (11.18) and (11.19) we may write
1/x0  −(π + 1)/2f
and
1/xi  (1 −π)/2f
(11.25)
1/r1  (σ + 1)/{2f (n −1)}
and
1/r2  (σ −1)/{2f (n −1)}. (11.26)
Introducing the expressions of Eqs. (11.24) to (11.26) into Eq. (1.17) we get
−1/x0 + 1/xiisph
 (n −1)(1/r1 −1/r2) + [ρ2/f 3]{Aσ 2 + Bσπ + Cπ2 + D},
(11.27)
where we abbreviated
A  (n + 2)/{8n(n −1)2}
B  (n + 1)/{2n(n −1)} (11.28)
C  (3n + 2)/(8n)
D  n2/{8(n −1)2}.
(11.29)
We may look at Eq. (11.27) as the thin lens equation plus a correction term. To
study whether spherical aberration can be removed we look at the correction
term
Y  [ρ2/f 3]{Aσ 2 + Bσπ + Cπ2 + D}.
(11.30)
When Y is equal to zero, spherical aberration is eliminated.
In FileFig 11.4 a graph is shown for f  10, n  1.5, ρ  4, and x0  4.
There are Y values smaller than zero and, using these parameters, spherical
aberration may be eliminated. In FileFig 11.4 one may study an example for
positive and negative values of x0 and ρ between 1 and 4. When Y shows negative
values, spherical aberration may be eliminated.

Application 11.4.
1. Study the π–σ equation and give two examples for elimination of spherical
aberration, for a positive and a negative value of x0.
2. Consider a set of lenses all having f  10cm, n  1.5, and radii of curvature
r1 and r2 such that the shape factor σ is between −2 and 2. Plot f s −f
depending on σ, where f s is the corrected focal length for spherical aberra-
tion. Make sketches of the radii of curvature for values of σ  −2, −1, 0, 1,
2 and compare with Jenkins and White (1976, p. 145).
11.5
COMA
So far we have discussed spherical aberration produced by the size of the lens for
on-axis points. When the object point is slightly off axis, the resulting aberration
is called coma. A new axis appears from the object point through the center of
the lens to the center of the image (Figure 11.5). The zones of the lens, indicated
by points in Figure 11.5, produce circles instead of image points. Only the
center zone produces a point image on the new axis. Larger zones produce
circles with larger radii depending on the distance from the new axis. The rings,
corresponding to the zones, are arranged like the tail of a comet.
We assume for this discussion of coma that spherical aberration has been
eliminated and follow Jenkins and White (1976, p.163). We assume that parallel
light is incident on the lens, and the sagittal coma CS is
CS  [(ρ2/f 2) tan β][Wσ + Gπ],
(11.31)
where ρ is the radius of the largest zone considered, π and σ are deﬁned in the
same way as in Eq. (11.24) and β is the angle between the axis of the system
and the new axis (Figure 11.6a). For W and G one has
W  3(n + 1)/{4n(n −1)}
and
G  3(2n + 1)/4n.
(11.32)
The tangential coma CT is shown in Figure 11.6b and is calculated to be 3CS. The
condition for elimination of coma is obtained from Eq. (11.31), when [Wσ +Gπ]

is equal to zero or
σ  −{(2n + 1)(n −1)π}/(n + 1).
(11.33)
In FileFig 11.5, a graph is shown of CT (ρ), calculated depending on the radii
of the zones ρ. There are positive and negative values for CT (ρ) depending on
the choice of the refractive index and one may choose parameters such that coma
is eliminated.

11.6
APLANATIC LENS
One may design a special lens, called an aplanatic lens, which has no coma and
no spherical aberration. We consider the two equations
σ  −(2n + 1)
and
π  (n + 1)/(n −1).
(11.34)

416
11. ABERRATION
FIGURE 11.7
Aplanatic lens. Light from the point x0  r1 is not refracted on the ﬁrst surface of
the lens, but on the second. This is shown in (a) for a lens and in (b) for a sphere.
According to Eq. (11.33) there will be no coma and no spherical aberration
because Y  0 (Eq. (11.30)). An example is shown in Figure 11.7. Introduction
of σ and π from Eq. (11.34) into the four expressions of Eqs. (11.24) and (11.25)
results in
r1  {r2(n + 1)}/n
f  {r2(n + 1)}/(1 −n)
(11.35)
x0  {r2(n + 1)}/n
xi  r2(n + 1).
(11.36)
The focal length of the aplanatic lens depends only on n and r2:
1/f  (1 −n)/{r2(n + 1)}.
(11.37)
To use it as an aplanatic lens, in addition to the thin lens equation, one has to
satisfy the relation between xi and x0:
xi  nx0.
(11.38)
We see from Figure 11.7a that the emerging rays from x0 are not refracted
at the surface of radius r1, but only when arriving at the surface of radius r2.
Therefore, we may consider x0 at P as the object point in a medium of refractive
index n and spherical surface of radius r2. This is called an aplanatic sphere,

shown in Figure 11.7b. The virtual image point P ′ is obtained by tracing back
the ray refracted at the second surface because the image is virtual.
In FileFig 11.6 we show that coma is eliminated for the aplanatic lens.

2. Get Y from FileFig 9.4 (A4SPHLSIPIS) and using the values from FF6 show
that Y  0.
3. Consider a farsighted eye and assume that the focal length is f  2.2 cm
and the distance from eye to retina d  2 cm. Design an applanatic lens for
correction, that is, bringing the focal point of the eye to the retina.
11.7
ASTIGMATISM
We have discussed in Sections 11.3 and 11.5 spherical aberration and coma. For
spherical aberration the object points were assumed to be on axis, and for coma
slightly off axis. When the object point is farther away from the axis, the image
points are no longer in one perpendicular plane with respect to the new axis, as
we found for coma. The points appear one behind the other on a new axis from
the object point through the center of the lens. There are two planes deﬁned with
respect to the new axis, called sagittal (horizontal) and meridional (vertical)
planes (see Figures 11.8 and 11.9). Each produces its own image point and
between these two points is the circle of least confusion.
The difference of the sagittal and meridional image points on the new axis is
called the astigmatic difference, ASD  xiH −xiV . Again we follow Jenkins
and White (1976, p. 167).
11.7.1
Astigmatism of a Single Spherical Surface
We ﬁrst calculate xiH and xiV for a single refracting surface, using the
corresponding imaging equations. For the horizontal image points one has
−1/x0 + n/xiH  (n cos φ′ −cos φ)/r
(11.39)
and for the vertical image point
−(cos φ)2/x0 + n(cos φ′)/xiV  (n cos φ′ −cosφ)/r,

where r is the radius of curvature of the spherical surface. The angles φ and φ′ are
shown in Figures 11.8a and b for the horizontal and vertical plane, respectively.
In FileFig 11.7 the astigmatic difference ASD is calculated depending on the
angle φ. The angle φ′ may be eliminated using the law of refraction.
11.7.2
Astigmatism of a Thin Lens
For the calculation of the ASD for a thin lens, one has for the sagittal and
meridional case each a thin lens equation with a corrected focal length. This is
similar to the above discussions of other aberrations. For the sagittal plane one
gets
−1/x0 + 1/xiH  (cos φ)[(cos φ′/ cos φ) −1](1/r1 −1/r2)
(11.41)
and for the meriodinal plane
−1/x0 + 1/xiV  {1/ cos φ}[(cos φ′/ cos φ) −1](1/r1 −1/r2)
(11.42)
In FileFig 11.8, we consider a lens with radii of curvature of r1  10,
r2  −12, and n  1.3. The ﬁrst graph shows the calculation of the astig-
matic difference ASD depending on the angle φ. The second graph shows for
the same lens the dependence on the refractive index n for φ  10 degrees.

11.8
CHROMATIC ABERRATION AND THE
ACHROMATIC DOUBLET
The aberrations discussed so far, spherical aberration, coma, and astigmatism,
are called monochromatic aberrations. One assumes that monochromatic light
is incident on the lens and therefore the refractive index of the law of refraction
is a constant. If the incident light is not monochromatic and the constant of the
law of refraction is different for different wavelengths, one speaks of chromatic
aberrations.
In Figure 11.10 positive chromatic aberration is shown. This means the image
point of the shorter wavelength light (blue) is closer to the lens than the image
pointofthelongerwavelengthlight.Thereversecaseiscalled negativechromatic
aberration. Chromatic aberration can be compensated by using two lenses. One
has positive and the other negative chromatic aberration. Such a double lens is
called an achromatic doublet.
An achromatic doublet is made of two lenses in contact. In Chapter 1 we
found that the focal length of a compound lens is
1/f  1/f1 + 1/f2
(11.43)
 (n1 −1)(1/r1 −1/r2) + (n2 −1)(1/r′
1 −1/r′
2),
where r1 and r2 are the radii of curvature of the lens with refractive index n1, and
r′
1 and r′
2 are the radii of curvature of the lens with n2. Using the abbreviations
k1  (1/r1 −1/r2)
and
k2  (1/r′
1 −1/r′
2)
(11.44)
we may write for 1/f ,
1/f  (n1 −1)k1 + (n2 −1)k2.
(11.45)
The condition to have the focal length independent of the refractive index in the
wavelength range λb to λr is
d/dλ(1/f )  d/dλ[(n1 −1)k1 + (n2 −1)k2]  0,
(11.46)

11.8. CHROMATIC ABERRATION AND THE ACHROMATIC DOUBLET
421
which translates into a condition for the wavelength dependence of the refractive
index
(dn1/dλ)k1 + (dn2/dλ)k2  0.
(11.47)
We simplify Eq. (11.47) by writing dn1  n1b −n1r and dn2  n2b  n2r,
where nb stands for the short wavelength limit of the light (blue) and nr for the
long wavelength limit of the light (red). One then gets
k1/k2  −(n2b −n2r)/(n1b −n1r).
(11.48)
For k1 and k2 we may write, using Eqs. (11.43) and (11.44),
k1  1/{f1(n1 −1)}
and
k2  1/{f2(n2 −1)}.
(11.49)
Introducing the average refractive indices n1  n1D and n2  n2D, where n1D
and n2D are the values of n1 and n2 in the middle between nb and nr, we deﬁne
V1  (n1b −n1r)/(n1D −1)
and
V2  (n2b −n2r)/(n2D −1).
(11.50)
As a result we have
f2/f1  −V2/V1.
(11.51)
An example is given in FileFig 11.9 for the calculation of the ﬁnal focal length
f , when the refractive indices and the radii of curvature for calculation of the
focal length f1 are given.

CHROMATIC ABERRATION AND THE
ACHROMATIC DOUBLET WITH SEPARATED
LENSES
Chromatic aberration may also be eliminated when using two lenses at distance
t. From Chapter 1, Section 1.3, we have for the focal length of such a system
1/f  1/f1 + 1/f2 −t(1/f1f2).
(11.52)
We want to determine t for given focal lengths f1 and f2 and choose refractive
indices with their wavelength dependence.
For one lens one has
1/fi  (ni −1)(1/r1 −1/r2).
(11.53)
Here i is 1 or 2. Differentiation with respect to ni yields
@(1/fi)  @ni(1/r1 −1/r2)  @ni/{fi(ni −1)}.
(11.54)
From V1  (n1b −n1r)/(n1D −1) of Eq. (11.50), which may now be written for
i equal to 1 or 2
Vi  @ni/(ni −1),
(11.55)
and we have
@(1/fi)  Vi/fi,
(11.56)
one obtains
@(1/f )  V1/f1 + V2/f2 −t{(1/f1)@(1/f2) + (1/f2)@(1/f1)}
 V1/f1 + V2/f2 −t{V1/f1f2 + V2/f2f1}.
(11.57)
The condition to have no chromatic aberration is obtained from @(1/f )  0 and
one gets
t  (V1f2 + V2f1)/(V1 + V2).
(11.58)
For two lenses of equal material this reduces to
t  (f1 + f2)/2.
(11.59)
An example is given in FileFig 11.10 for the calculation of the distance of the
two lenses. To calculate Vi we have used the same values as in FileFig 11.9. The
two lenses are assumed to have different radii of curvature and the distance t for
no chromatic aberration is calculated.

Call on “Surface plot” and type at the place holder just M and push “F9.”
Go with the mouse on the graph and change the angle of the “point of view.”
Click twice on the graph and get “3D-Plot Format” for “graph options.” Switch
to contour plot.
